00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 314 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I go. Good evening. The machine rolls on. That's what happens. When your time is up and you leave, the machine is going to roll on.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And that can be hard on your brain, on your ego. It can also just be hard because you love the teams. You care about the boys.

4
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And when you leave, you worry about the void that is there. And you think, who's going to fill that void? And you wonder if you did a good enough job passing on what you learned.

5
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And that's rough. That was one of the hardest things for me when I left when I got out of the Navy. Because my whole life, my whole life had been in the sealed teams. I was full on institutionalized by the sealed teams.

6
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I didn't know anything else in the world. And I couldn't help but feel that I was leaving them hanging, leaving my friend hanging that I was letting them down.

7
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But the reality is that the machine rolls on. And there are guys that are ready to step up and take your place and take things to the next level and do a better job.

8
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And carry the torch and take the fight to the enemy and uphold the traditions and uphold the reputation of the teams and elevate it.

9
00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And so, because this next generation of frog men step up the machine rolls on. And I am lucky enough to have one of those frog men here with me tonight Carlos Mendez.

10
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And I am lucky enough to have one of those little frog men who have been here. And I am lucky enough to have one of those little frog men who have been here.

11
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And Carlos, thanks for joining us, man. Pleasure to be here. What year did you check in a team one? 2005. Okay, so it was like I checked in a team one in 1991.

12
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
No fun one. It was still no fun when I got there.

13
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Well, we'll get there. Let's go back to where you came from because damn, I mean it's a weird ride, right? It's a, it's you got a, you got an interesting background story. So you're not even, you're not born to America.

14
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000
No, that was born in Guatemala. So, you know, you know, you know, I'll even start before that.

15
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So my father passed away when my mom was pregnant with me. Oh, great. So yeah, actually she got the news on the day of her baby shower.

16
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What a die from car accident.

17
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Yeah.

18
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So I was born in Guatemala to a single mom, obviously. And, you know, my grandparents, my, my dad was their favorite son.

19
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So when my mom had me, I was the favorite grandchild. And they had, they had a lot of, they wanted a lot of control over the way she raised me. And it was this conflict back and forth.

20
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And, you know, when I talked to my mom, she said, ultimately, that's what.

21
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I drove her to the decision to immigrate to the US. She's like, I need to get you away from here because I was, I was spoiled rock.

22
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
From what I hear, I was an absolute terror. And I can get away with it because grandma was there to protect me. And yeah, she used to babysit me. My mom would drop me off in the mornings.

23
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And it was funny because the things that you remember, just so weird, I remember, we would go get gas in in Guatemala. You know, people don't have a lot of money. So if you filled up a full gas tank, you got a baby chick.

24
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Okay.

25
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Yeah. So my mom, you know, filled the gas tank up and we would get a baby chick. So I remember I would drive back to my grandma's house. And I would have that baby chick. And we had all kinds of them, you know, from all times we filled up the gas tank.

26
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So, any chasing chasing a bunch of chickens and chicks on the backyard.

27
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's interesting that your mom, she got to be a pretty interesting human because you would figure, here she is single mom.

28
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And she actually has this kid, you, that is getting soon over by the grandparents. It seems like a single mom would be like, thank God these grandparents are here to help me through this.

29
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I'm totally, I'm kind of set now, right? I got like backup as opposed to no backup, which you know, your dad was dead. I mean, that's, but she, but she just thought, oh, he's being spoiled.

30
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We're out here.

31
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Oh, yeah, my mom's a gangster. She is very old school Hispanic, just very, you know, disciplined.

32
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Screw your feelings kind of thing. It's always your fault kind of thing.

33
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I remember any time I got in trouble, she said, would you do it was your fault?

34
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm like everybody else's parents stand up for them. I'm like, what would you do? I know, I know was your fault.

35
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Somewhere another was your fault. So that's why I was kind of joke around with JP that I had extreme ownership.

36
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yeah, basically. But yeah, that's what drove her decision to leave Guatemala and suit US.

37
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So how old were you when you came to the US? Do you remember, I guess you must remember to remember the class?

38
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I mean, there's, you know, things here and there that you remember, I was like four or five, but I do remember I was in school.

39
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I remember showing up to school not being able to speak English.

40
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And my mom set me up for total success. And I say that's our classic because she would dress me up in like a college or everything was had to be like a call because you know,

41
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Guatemala, you dress nice to go to school. You have uniform.

42
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And now we were in San Francisco, not in Nice Area either.

43
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And so I'm wearing this, you know, button up shirt with some some Docker type pants that we got at the goodwill.

44
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Sure had to be tucked in. And like these alligator skin shoes.

45
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Because in Guatemala, they're cheap, you know, like all year skin shoes. So that was like the thing.

46
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And she's like, you know, Guatemala, these are like a luxury.

47
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm like, well, over here is getting my ass kicked.

48
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Where these alligator shoes and dockers and tucked in shirt. So yeah.

49
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I needless to say I ran to a lot of issues when I first showed up.

50
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Didn't speak English and dressed them like a complete door.

51
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And then, you know, the kids that I'm with are little rough around the edges.

52
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
What did your mom do for work when she got her?

53
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So I remember she worked at.

54
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
She worked at the school that I was at. So she can keep an eye on me as a teacher's assistant.

55
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And then after school, I remember she worked as she would clean houses.

56
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And I remember going after school, we would go to whoever's house and she would clean it.

57
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And I would do my homework while she cleaned.

58
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And if I didn't have homework, like I would help her out.

59
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And then I think like twice a week or so, she would go to English school to learn how to speak English.

60
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And I'll go with her there.

61
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And if you're getting what's immersion training at school, because just showing up in there speaking all English.

62
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Oh yeah. Yeah.

63
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And it's kind of funny because when, so my mom's side of the family was already in San Francisco, Oakland, Baria.

64
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Oh, so that's why we moved there.

65
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
She had her side of the family there.

66
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
My dad's side of the family was the one that's saying Guatemala.

67
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Because they're actually pretty well off there.

68
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So she had that support system.

69
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And I thought it was, it was interesting how my family was like, oh, the kids need to learn how to speak English.

70
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
So the kids won't make fun of them.

71
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And my mom was like, I don't care about his feelings.

72
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Like, okay, they make fun of him. So what?

73
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
He's not allowed to speak English at home.

74
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Because he's going to forget Spanish.

75
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
He's going to learn English regardless.

76
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But I want him to remember how to speak Spanish.

77
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So at home, I wasn't allowed to speak any English.

78
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
You're well as a gangster, huh?

79
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Oh, dude. She's just heartless.

80
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And then, so then you end up, she ended up meeting someone else or getting married to someone else, right?

81
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Like, like, a step down showed up basically.

82
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Yep.

83
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So she actually met my stepdad in San Francisco and English school.

84
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So he was from Czechoslovakia when it was still Czechoslovakia.

85
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Yeah.

86
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And his story is pretty amazing.

87
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You know, when he was in high school.

88
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So he was there when it was still under communist rule.

89
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Mm-hmm.

90
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So when he tells a story, you know, he was in high school and he drew a cartoon,

91
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
criticizing communism.

92
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And I guess like a week later, some men showed up.

93
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
They dragged him out of school.

94
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They beat him up.

95
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And then they told him, hey, when you graduate,

96
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
we're going to send you to the mines and you're going to die there.

97
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
You're going to work there for the rest of your life to die.

98
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So he was just like, nope, not happening.

99
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
He started planning his escape.

100
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And didn't tell anybody not a soul,

101
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
packed his stuff and like this green bag that he actually still had when I met him.

102
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Packed everything he had in there and ran away.

103
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And he just recently told me this story to like maybe two, three months ago.

104
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Like the actual details of how he crawled for days across the border.

105
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And somehow made it into Yugoslavia.

106
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And yeah, it's a pretty crazy story.

107
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah, the when you're in those communist countries,

108
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the amount of in government in for like,

109
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
it's some crazy number, like 50% of people are government informants.

110
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's a crazy number.

111
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So you're step that couldn't have told anybody because if you tell one person,

112
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
you might as well just tell everybody and you're going to get rat it out.

113
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And he's already got the threats of being the mines for the rest of his life and dying there.

114
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Good lord.

115
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Yeah.

116
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Freaking savages.

117
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So they end up getting married.

118
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
That means that the next phase.

119
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah, they start dating.

120
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And in my head, I'm thinking like, oh, sweet.

121
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm finally going to have a dad.

122
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You know, little did I know he was meaner than my mom.

123
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You know, I mean, he's a hard hard man.

124
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean, he's, you know, communist block.

125
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
They grew up very, very hard up there.

126
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Life is hard.

127
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So he was hard on me.

128
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So what were you doing growing up?

129
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
What was it?

130
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
What was a day in the life of Carlos?

131
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Let's say age 11.

132
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Oh, by that time we had, I'm not sure.

133
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I don't remember if we had already moved out to Sacramento at one point.

134
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
You know, they were like, hey, you know, the barriers just to expensive.

135
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It's not a great place to raise a family.

136
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And we moved out to Sacramento.

137
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And I remember we started renting this house out that had this huge yard.

138
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Well, for me, it was huge.

139
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I hadn't seen a backyard.

140
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You know, in the same room as this guy or Oakland.

141
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And, and he just gave me a ton of chores.

142
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Like, that's what my life, so my life was I come home from school.

143
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I do chores.

144
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I do homework.

145
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And then after we dinner, you know, I wash all the dishes.

146
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I take everything off the counter, wipe them all down.

147
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Sweet mop.

148
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Like, that was something that I did every single day.

149
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And then in the backyard, I always had all kinds of chores that he had for me.

150
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I think a lot of it too had to do with he worked on.

151
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Like, he is probably the hardest working man I've ever met my life.

152
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Like, yeah, he was mean and probably growing up.

153
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I wasn't, I hated him growing up.

154
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But now that I'm all grown up and I look back like man, that guy worked his ass off.

155
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Like, he did anything and everything he could do.

156
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Like, I remember he used to sell like vacuums for electrolux.

157
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He used to deliver pieces for Domino's pizza.

158
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
He finally got into it.

159
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I teach he tech to become a drafter.

160
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So he became a drafter eventually designing like elevators or something like that.

161
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And then I remember he would do that all day.

162
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
He would come home.

163
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He would take a nap and then he would go back and deliver pieces all night long.

164
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
You can get maybe like two, three hours of sleeping, do it all over again.

165
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So, you know, looking back now, I'm like, okay, that's why I had to do so much stuff around the house.

166
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Because he just wasn't around.

167
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
He was providing for the family.

168
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And when you get to like what kind of kids are you hanging out with?

169
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
You play any sports or anything?

170
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
No, my mom and like I said, my mom and dad were both really strict on me.

171
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And the only two things that I was really allowed to do growing up,

172
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I remember were Legos and reading.

173
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So I would devour any book.

174
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I can get my hands on because we weren't allowed to watch like TV.

175
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Actually, I don't think we owned a TV for a big portion.

176
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And then finally when we did, we weren't allowed to watch a whole lot of it.

177
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They had a subscription to Reader's Digest.

178
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So I would read Reader's Digest, cover to cover.

179
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
As soon as it came in, I was actually the one that ripped the wrap rope and I would just start reading.

180
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And it's funny because it was actually the first time that I was exposed to the teams.

181
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Even though I didn't know it, there was an article in Reader's Digest when I was a kid.

182
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And it was something like the hardest school.

183
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You know, I don't remember exactly what the title, but it was, it talked about this gentleman who was in the army.

184
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I saw some team guys and went to Buds and he talked about his experience going to Buds.

185
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But at the time I didn't know what it was.

186
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I was just like, oh cool story.

187
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
But yeah, Legos, reading, I wasn't allowed to really play with other kids because my life was like chores and homework.

188
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And my parents were both perfectionist.

189
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So, you know, I would turn in my homework and if the handwriting was sloppy, they'd do it over.

190
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Or like the dishes.

191
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Like if I do the dishes and like one of them was wrong, my stuff, I'd be like, do it more lower.

192
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
No, dang it.

193
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So, that's kind of how I remember my childhood was a lot of chores.

194
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
homework.

195
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And then kind of just reading a lot and playing with Legos a lot.

196
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Yes, sir.

197
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Did you end up, yeah, I think you've mentioned me, you had some kind of like a little farm or something at some point?

198
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Yeah.

199
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Or like at least some little animals running around the house.

200
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Yeah, so at one point, you know, we got accepted for this program that was like for low income families,

201
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
where they allowed you to build your house.

202
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And it would offset some of the costs, but it would, you know, it was like a pat to ownership.

203
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Yeah, that's legit.

204
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And so my parents both applied for it.

205
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We got accepted.

206
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So for a long time, that was actually a big part of my childhood too.

207
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
For a long time, I remember like going to school and then going to help at the construction site.

208
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
My weekends, same thing.

209
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
They were, they were suspended the construction site helping build our house.

210
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And when it was completed, you know, my stepdad had all kinds of stuff in the back yard.

211
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Like we had this little farm.

212
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So we had, he built like, when I say he built, I'm a mostly I built.

213
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Because my weekends were like, I remember I, he can say,

214
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Oh, I'm going to get to sleep in.

215
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And I would just hear a bang on my window like at five,

216
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
30 in the morning and a 10 like, hey, get up.

217
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's time to work.

218
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I'm like, dang.

219
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
You know, so I go out there and we built the greenhouse.

220
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
We had all kinds of fruits and vegetables.

221
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We had a compost pile.

222
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So I remember digging that hole.

223
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
He made him wanted it so big.

224
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And I spent forever.

225
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I did all our irrigation.

226
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So I dug all the holes for that.

227
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And then he got this idea for, so we had all our fruits and vegetables.

228
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So he's like, now we need our meat.

229
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
So he's like, we're going to, you know, and check.

230
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We used to grab it.

231
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
So I remember going to the state farm like looking at all these different rabbits.

232
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And then he's like, oh, these are the kind that you can eat.

233
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So we bought like a male rabbit and like two or three females.

234
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And we started breeding rabbits.

235
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Little did I know that was going to be that's,

236
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
so that's another chore now.

237
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I had like taking care of these rabbits feeding them, you know,

238
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
cleaning up their poop.

239
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And then when I got the poop, I put it in the compost pile.

240
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And everything, like all the clippings from the grass and everything we grew with

241
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
throwing the compost pile and now I have to get in there and like mix it up and it's miserable.

242
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
But then the baby rabbits got to the to age.

243
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And he's like, hey, your chore from now on.

244
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Another chore is going to be like, hey, you're going to kill the rabbits.

245
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You're going to skin them and you're going to put them in the freezer.

246
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I'm like, well, I don't know how to kill a rabbit.

247
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
He's like, you know, learn today.

248
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And he's like, well, let me know.

249
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
He's like, let me know when you kill that first rabbit.

250
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Let me know and I'll show you how to skin it.

251
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So I remember being a kid because I'm looking at, I'm like, I'm holding it this part.

252
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I want to say junior high.

253
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Okay.

254
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So what's that?

255
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Like 12 or 13?

256
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Yeah.

257
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Something like this.

258
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I'm all around 11 or 12.

259
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Okay.

260
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Because I remember being young.

261
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Because I remember the first one, I'm like, okay, I think I'm going to drown the rabbit.

262
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Right.

263
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So I grab a bug. Yeah. I fill it up with water.

264
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And I grab this rabbit and I put it in the bucket and it free him won't die.

265
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And now I'm crying.

266
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I remember crying because I'm like, oh my god, please die.

267
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Just die, damn it.

268
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And I'm just holding it and just, like, finally, you know, the rabbit dies.

269
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And I'm just like, oh my god, that was most miserable experience ever.

270
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I'm like, I'm literally, I'm crying. I'm a kid.

271
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And so finally, I go back in. I'm like, okay, I killed the rabbit.

272
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You know, I'm going to need to eat like, stop crying, Fufina.

273
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
That was his nickname for me.

274
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Which Fufina is, is Regan Czechoslovakian for what?

275
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
It's Czechoslovakian for pussy.

276
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So, you know, he shows me how to skin the rabbit.

277
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And I'm like, okay, and I'm not really paying attention because I don't drown the time.

278
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
You're all on the time, bro.

279
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And then he's like, raise your rabbits.

280
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So, so now he's like, okay, it's time to kill the second one.

281
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And now I'm like, I'm going to do it a different way.

282
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So I'm like, I grab a two-by-four.

283
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I'm like, all right, I'm going to hit this rabbit on the head.

284
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So I grab the rabbit. I'm like, patting it.

285
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
You know, and then I hit it, but I kind of half has hit it.

286
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So now he's just like, torlling in my hands.

287
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And now again, I got snott running out my nose tears.

288
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And I'm just like, hitting this rabbit again, like, please damn it.

289
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Just die.

290
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And finally after wacking it, like a million times died.

291
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Same thing comes out, teaches me how to skin it.

292
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
And then on the third rabbit, something happened.

293
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
You know, something already happened.

294
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
So I was like, but something happened that actually stuck with me for, for till today.

295
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Oh, actually.

296
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
All right.

297
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
So I remember I got this rabbit and I'm petting it.

298
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And now I'm talking to myself.

299
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And I'm like, all right, motherfucker.

300
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
By the way, this is how serial killers get created.

301
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Just have a nice, full on the stock of yourself.

302
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So when I told my wife the story, she's like, I get it.

303
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
But I'm looking at this rabbit and I'm like, you know, talking to myself.

304
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I'm like, pop, pop myself up.

305
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I'm like, you know what?

306
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I got to commit.

307
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Like 100% commit.

308
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
So I remember I grabbed that rabbit.

309
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I grabbed that two by four.

310
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
And I hit it as hard as I could.

311
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
And it was out.

312
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And from that point on, it's crazy.

313
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Because even in the teams, when I did something that I was a little bit scared of,

314
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
or even in, you know, anything, I'm like commit.

315
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
That thought has always kind of my head like, if you're scared of doing something,

316
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
you've got a 100% commit or it's not going to work.

317
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And then that moment, I had that epiphany.

318
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
That's the 11, 12 year old kid.

319
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
So yeah, that's my rabbit story.

320
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
So I, you know, a lot of times people ask me questions about,

321
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
because I got kids in parenting and all that stuff.

322
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And one thing I warn parents of, you know, if you push hard to get your kids,

323
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
they're going to push back.

324
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And by the way, this isn't just with kids.

325
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
This is with a seal puttune.

326
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
This is with a company that's with a business.

327
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
You start imposing stuff on people.

328
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
They're going to start to push back because they're humans and humans don't like to have things imposed on them.

329
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
And you can, by the way, you can impose things on people permanently.

330
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
But you have to like crush them.

331
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Yeah.

332
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
You have to continuously crush them forever.

333
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And you have to be willing to go to that distance where you crush them,

334
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
which is not going to produce the type of humans that you want.

335
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
So was there any push back?

336
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And let me rephrase that at what age did you start to say,

337
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I'm pushing back against this stuff.

338
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I'm going to say around my sophomore year.

339
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
You know, I'm 15.

340
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And, you know, like I said, my stepdad ruled with an iron fist.

341
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And at that point, I'm like, you know what?

342
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I'm not scared of you anymore.

343
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Because his punishments were so extreme.

344
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
His punishments were like, oh, you're grounded for the weekend.

345
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
It was like, the ground up for the next two months.

346
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And if I messed up, it was like another month.

347
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And it was like, dude, there's like no light at the end of this tunnel.

348
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Two months when you're a kid.

349
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
It's a lot of life.

350
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
So yeah.

351
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So, and you know, they didn't let me play sports.

352
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
So I wasn't hanging around the jocks.

353
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So guess why I hung out with.

354
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I hung out with thugs.

355
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I hung out with the people that weren't the best influence on me.

356
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
And I got into some trouble.

357
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
You know, and I got locked away in juvenile hall.

358
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And so how old are you?

359
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
15, 16 years old.

360
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And I remember when that happened because my stepdad

361
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
at this point, he had actually just graduated the CHP Academy.

362
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
So now he's law enforcement.

363
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Damn.

364
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Yeah, he's law enforcement.

365
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And I'm running around, you know,

366
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Little, little mini gang banger.

367
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yeah, breaking the law.

368
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And at one point I got caught.

369
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
I got arrested.

370
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And I remember the cop bringing me in and interviewing me.

371
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And I'm just like, I don't want to talk.

372
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Because you know, I got that stupid mentality.

373
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
I'm not, I'm no snitch.

374
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
No, I'm a gangster.

375
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
So I don't snitch.

376
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I don't say anything.

377
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And he's like, hey, it's not going to go a little.

378
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I know everybody else was singing like a bird.

379
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So it's crazy because I remember going to court.

380
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
So they put me away.

381
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
They call my parents and my parents like leave them there.

382
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Like you don't want to come get your kids like no.

383
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Leave them there.

384
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And I knew.

385
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And I even told the cop on like, don't bother call my parents.

386
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
They're going to leave me here.

387
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
He's like, you were right.

388
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
So anyways, I'm in court.

389
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And you know, judge is like, hey, do you want an attorney?

390
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And I was like, no, I don't.

391
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And he's like, are you sure?

392
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Do you know what you're doing?

393
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I'm like, yep, I don't need an attorney.

394
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I was like 15 years old.

395
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I had a represet myself for the call.

396
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Well, I was like, hey, I'm guilty.

397
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
I did it.

398
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Oh, I got you.

399
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And he's like, so you plead.

400
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
I was like, I plead guilty.

401
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Like I'm not even going to fight it.

402
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And he's like, check.

403
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
And he gave me my sentence.

404
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And I remember seeing my parents and no expression on their face.

405
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
But I could tell like, my mom was disappointed for me.

406
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Yeah.

407
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
They took me away in coughs.

408
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And I had to do my time.

409
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And you've been on the wrong way, you're in duty for me.

410
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
I think I think a couple months.

411
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And that's because they were full.

412
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And honestly, I was a good respectful.

413
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
I was a very honoured segment.

414
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I made.

415
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
But I was a respectful kid because of the way I was raised.

416
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So when I was in duty, like, you know, the correction officers are like, you're like,

417
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
the politest criminal I've ever met.

418
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Did you start to see the path that you were going down at that point?

419
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And realize like, maybe this is the way it's going to end up.

420
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Yeah.

421
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
So, you know, having different roommates in juvenile hall kind of open my eyes.

422
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
I'm like, man, I don't belong here.

423
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Like some of the kids that were in there, like one of my roommates was in there because, you know,

424
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
he tried to murder this girl with his friends.

425
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And they were so high off drugs that when they tried to dig, they did the whole to bury the body.

426
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
They were so high that they buried the whole, like, not even a foot deep.

427
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And they put her in there and just put some dirt in there and realized you still alive.

428
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
You know, I mean, those are the kind of roommates that I had.

429
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
At one point, they put me in with like a kid who was in there for hate crime, like a skin head,

430
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
and they're for hate crime.

431
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
And you know, just being there, I'm like, dang, I don't belong here.

432
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.000
And I felt terrible that my parents, because I knew my parents had raised me the right way.

433
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I'm like, man, I really let them down here.

434
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So that's why I knew I was like, this is, this is not what I want to do.

435
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
So, the source of that, a lot of times you people think that,

436
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
but then, you know, as soon as they get out and they get back around their friends, you know,

437
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
was that a good enough, like, scared straight situation that you actually,

438
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
store scared straight?

439
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I wouldn't say scared straight because now I'm like, okay, I did it.

440
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
It was fine.

441
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
In my head, I'm like, I'm hard.

442
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
You know, like, I go back in the duty.

443
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Now I'm on probation and any little thing is like an automatic 10 days you go back.

444
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
So when I got out, same thing, it was actually even worse now,

445
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000
you know, and it got to the point where I'm like, hey, you know what?

446
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I'm going to do whatever I want, whenever I want, whatever I want,

447
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
and I would wait for my parents to go to bed and I would just sneak out of the house.

448
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
So you kind of got emboldened.

449
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Oh, because you went in there because it wasn't really a scared straight thing.

450
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
It was more like you got emboldened because you think, hey, dude,

451
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
I can do what I can do if he wasn't that bad.

452
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Yep, because I don't know.

453
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
No factor.

454
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
I'll get out.

455
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
And you actually got, you actually got worse.

456
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
So I stopped committing crimes.

457
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
But I was going now.

458
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I just wanted to hang out with my friends, honestly, because it was just so strict.

459
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And where I made my mistake is this is around the time where cell phones started coming out.

460
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
So I would, you know, my parents went to bed early too.

461
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And they would put me to bed like an eight o'clock.

462
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I don't know if teenagers put me to bed at eight o'clock.

463
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
But at the time of my life.

464
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
To cool me, yeah.

465
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Put me to bed early, you know, because the earlier you put me in the early,

466
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm leaving.

467
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
So I would wait for them to go to bed.

468
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
I would go to the living room.

469
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I would grab my dad's cell phone.

470
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
And then I would roll out.

471
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And now I'm the only kid like Roman Brown, like with a cell phone.

472
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I'm like, yeah, let's call so and so and so and so and so and so like, you know,

473
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
until the cell phone bill came out.

474
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I didn't know that because I didn't know how cell phones were.

475
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Yeah, because back then, this is in the 90s.

476
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Oh, yeah.

477
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
So yeah.

478
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So you get your target charge per minute per call.

479
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Oh yeah.

480
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
It wasn't cheap either.

481
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
No, it was like a dollar a minute.

482
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Yeah, or some crazy like that.

483
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Yeah, so my dad blew a casket when he saw that bill and

484
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
all his story, it was just this constant back and forth between him and I.

485
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And it got to point when I told him, I'm like, hey, I'm not scared to you.

486
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
I'm going to do whatever I want whenever I want.

487
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Like what do you do?

488
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Meet me?

489
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
You're you're crowned me.

490
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
I'm already grounded for a life.

491
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And so at this time,

492
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I'm still getting in trouble for smaller things in my probation officer.

493
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
It was like, hey, listen, you're like at the point where we're just going to

494
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
put you away to your 18.

495
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I was like, oh, okay.

496
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And I had a teacher at the time that I had built a great relationship with.

497
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
ship with. He was like a life skills class,

498
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
way to you had like right checks, pay your bills,

499
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.24
you know, stuff like that. And him and I had built a good relationship and I don't know how he got

500
00:26:42.24 --> 00:26:47.28
wind of it, but he knew the judge or whatever and he was like, hey, you know, he's a good kid.

501
00:26:47.68 --> 00:26:51.60
He just, he's got a situation at home where he doesn't get along with the stepdad and

502
00:26:52.40 --> 00:26:56.96
and the judge is like, well, if you think he's such a good kid, then you adopt him. And he said, okay,

503
00:26:56.96 --> 00:27:04.96
he adopted me and at that point, like, I think my stepdad was like at the end of his, you know,

504
00:27:05.20 --> 00:27:09.84
his way, he's just like, I can't, I can't handle this kid. He's like, go, and he signed a way.

505
00:27:10.88 --> 00:27:15.36
So you're 16, 17 at this point? 17, yes, 17.

506
00:27:15.36 --> 00:27:18.64
So you're going to basically, you're senior year. You're senior year of high school. You're going to

507
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:24.16
live with your teacher. Yeah. So I lived with him and it was, uh,

508
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:28.48
what was the deal with this teacher? Do you just like the coolest teacher ever? I don't know. So he was

509
00:27:28.48 --> 00:27:33.44
very religious. Like very him and his wife were very religious. They had five kids. They had raised

510
00:27:33.44 --> 00:27:40.40
them all to be very like successful people. Like they were just good people. But in my head, I'm like,

511
00:27:40.40 --> 00:27:46.16
what is this guy thinking? Because I wouldn't let some little thug move in with me. But honestly,

512
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:51.04
when I moved in with him, I was so grateful that I told him, I'm like, hey, this is your house,

513
00:27:51.04 --> 00:27:56.80
your rules, and I'll follow them. And I didn't give him like a peep of trouble because I was so grateful

514
00:27:57.68 --> 00:28:02.08
for what he had done. And he treated me, he treated me like an adult for the first time.

515
00:28:03.12 --> 00:28:06.48
You know, he was just like, hey, if you're going to go out, just let me know who you're with,

516
00:28:06.48 --> 00:28:11.92
what time you've been back. And for me, that was like, what? You know, let me go out with my friend.

517
00:28:11.92 --> 00:28:16.56
They always something that I wasn't allowed to do before. So I was so grateful for that.

518
00:28:16.56 --> 00:28:20.80
I'm like, do as a great thing. I don't want to mess it up and you didn't hear a peep from me.

519
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:24.16
I'm gonna be the rest of the year. My guy was on my best behavior with him.

520
00:28:25.04 --> 00:28:26.48
Are you getting good grades in school?

521
00:28:27.12 --> 00:28:30.40
Yeah, so actually, that's the funny thing, because I actually did really well in school.

522
00:28:30.88 --> 00:28:35.20
Even this whole time. And it was funny, because I had my probation officer required like a

523
00:28:35.20 --> 00:28:39.76
progress report. So that's how he got a wind of it. Because the teachers would look at me

524
00:28:39.76 --> 00:28:43.84
and be like, dude, you're good kid, you get good grades. What do you feeling this out for?

525
00:28:43.84 --> 00:28:47.68
I'm like my probation officer. Yeah, they would look at me over. Yeah.

526
00:28:47.68 --> 00:28:53.84
Yeah. And so there were a couple of teachers actually during that time that had a big influence on

527
00:28:53.84 --> 00:29:00.24
the one of them's name is Bobby prior. He's prior Navy vet. And he talked about Navy seals too.

528
00:29:00.64 --> 00:29:04.96
And he had a big influence on me as well. And I remember him telling stories about, you know,

529
00:29:04.96 --> 00:29:08.48
when he was in the Navy, and he told me the story that stuck with me for a long time about these two

530
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.04
seals. They were on the beach and they got to fight with some biker dudes. And they just got back

531
00:29:13.04 --> 00:29:17.44
back and back and got after it. And he's like these bikers were laid out. And he just talked about how bad

532
00:29:17.44 --> 00:29:21.84
ass Navy seals were. But I still didn't make that connection, you know what I mean?

533
00:29:21.84 --> 00:29:26.64
The connection being that this is something you could actually do with your life. Correct. Yeah. I was just like,

534
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:31.44
oh, that's cool. You know, so between him and the other teacher that I lived with,

535
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:36.40
they were a big influence on me in a different way. Like, I might, you know,

536
00:29:36.40 --> 00:29:39.92
my stepdad taught me a lot of things that I'm super grateful how to be tough, how to be, you know,

537
00:29:39.92 --> 00:29:46.56
work ethic, but they had like a softer, more empathetic mentoring. I think that's a better with.

538
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:52.32
They were more mentoring me. Yeah. I know the, um, well, here's your, your dad saying,

539
00:29:52.32 --> 00:29:55.52
hey, you can't go out with your friends or sorry, your stepdad saying you can't go out with your

540
00:29:55.52 --> 00:30:00.08
friends, et cetera, your mom's super strict. And it makes you want to not do what they're telling

541
00:30:00.08 --> 00:30:03.36
you to do. Oh, I'm going to the percent. When they impose things on you, making it want to do it,

542
00:30:03.36 --> 00:30:07.76
this other dude says, hey, you do what you want. Just, you know, just let me know what you're doing.

543
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:15.28
And you all of a sudden want to follow the rules. It's like, so such simple psychology on human beings,

544
00:30:15.28 --> 00:30:18.80
when you impose things on people, they don't like it. When you give them freedom, they're going

545
00:30:18.80 --> 00:30:24.08
to take advantage of it. And you know, positive way, I don't hear something interesting. Like,

546
00:30:24.08 --> 00:30:29.52
I have grown kids now. Everyone that's not grown, but my other kids are, you know, uh, how

547
00:30:29.52 --> 00:30:38.88
122, 20, and 18, they didn't have curfews. Like, like, I just be like, oh, yep, cool. Oh, you know,

548
00:30:38.88 --> 00:30:44.08
go out. This is when they were 13 years old, 15 years old. I'd say, okay, you know, let me know

549
00:30:44.08 --> 00:30:48.96
where you're going. Sometimes, hey, you know, when you're going to be back, you come back tonight.

550
00:30:48.96 --> 00:30:53.76
And I just let them do what they want to do. And they all turn it out. They all are fine, you know,

551
00:30:53.76 --> 00:30:55.76
which

552
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:00.08
I mean you're like studying then they all

553
00:31:01.28 --> 00:31:11.12
You're like I mean they're all good kid. I mean they're all they all actually all they all good kids. They all like you know are on really good pass in life and I never now if you were to step

554
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.44
There was some incidents that took place along the way some some

555
00:31:15.44 --> 00:31:21.76
Things that needed some corrective measures need to be imposed from time to time if things got a little bit too far out of line and

556
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.52
That happened a few times

557
00:31:23.52 --> 00:31:28.000
But then it was like oh they'd get back in line and realize and then I would just give them kind of given their freedom back

558
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:32.68
But you know what come one of the key things is that you said is and I tell this to people all the time

559
00:31:33.20 --> 00:31:34.88
Treat them like adults

560
00:31:34.88 --> 00:31:40.32
Especially when they're in that age. This is a trick to this is a little trick to this. There's an age where oh

561
00:31:40.64 --> 00:31:45.04
Your 14 years old. Oh, you think you can you want to be you want to be an adult. Okay cool. Guess what adults have

562
00:31:45.04 --> 00:31:50.96
Jobs guess what adults do pay bills. They pay rent. They pay for their cell phone. They pay for their food

563
00:31:50.96 --> 00:31:54.32
So you want to be treated like an adult you want to do it every aren't cool. I can treat you to like an adult

564
00:31:55.60 --> 00:32:00.60
You'll rent or you know you need to pay for food and all that stuff and they realize really quick

565
00:32:00.60 --> 00:32:02.08
That's a real good

566
00:32:02.08 --> 00:32:05.68
Appreciation tool they want to make somebody appreciate what they've got

567
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:10.72
Make a treat them like an adult and they kind of they're thinking they want to get treated like an adult

568
00:32:11.20 --> 00:32:13.52
And then when they start getting treated like adult they go

569
00:32:13.52 --> 00:32:16.24
Hey, I'm cool with being a kid for a little bit longer

570
00:32:18.88 --> 00:32:23.68
So what you doing you graduate from high school? Was it straight to the Navy? No, no

571
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:26.48
I actually know intentions of joining the military

572
00:32:26.48 --> 00:32:31.92
So after high school I started working construction full-time and then on the weekends

573
00:32:31.92 --> 00:32:37.20
I worked at longs drugs on Saturdays and Sundays and this was the summer after I graduated

574
00:32:37.20 --> 00:32:42.16
I really didn't know what I wanted to do and then you know those two teachers are told about they're like oh, so you know

575
00:32:42.16 --> 00:32:46.84
You got to start college. I was like no one had ever talked to me about college and I was like

576
00:32:46.84 --> 00:32:49.68
I don't you know I wasn't excited about it

577
00:32:49.96 --> 00:32:55.84
So they signed me up for college. They helped me out and I started going to community college and I didn't like it

578
00:32:55.84 --> 00:32:58.76
I was there and I'm just like I feel like this is high school over again

579
00:32:58.76 --> 00:32:59.92
Because you know you're taking the pre-rex

580
00:32:59.92 --> 00:33:04.12
They're taking the same stuff so in my head I'm like I'm not learning anything right now

581
00:33:04.12 --> 00:33:05.48
That's gonna help me in life

582
00:33:05.48 --> 00:33:12.12
So I dropped out very quickly. I think I was there for like two minutes and I went back to working construction because I was making

583
00:33:12.12 --> 00:33:18.76
You know for an 187 actually I was still 17 because I graduated on 17. I was making good money for you know 17 18 year old

584
00:33:18.76 --> 00:33:23.72
Sure, and I would work seven days a week because I loved the fact that the more I worked the more money I would make

585
00:33:24.44 --> 00:33:27.44
So I'm like dude, no you mean I can work seven days a week so I did it

586
00:33:28.08 --> 00:33:31.24
And it was around that time at longs drugs. They used to have

587
00:33:32.36 --> 00:33:37.80
VHS you know, it's still a VHS and we rented out movies and so every Friday night

588
00:33:37.80 --> 00:33:41.08
I would go and pick a movie out for myself and that would be my Friday night

589
00:33:41.08 --> 00:33:45.16
And one day I picked up the movie Navy Seals which I really should

590
00:33:46.96 --> 00:33:51.16
And I went home and I watched it and I was just like whoa

591
00:33:51.56 --> 00:33:58.96
This is badass and then that's when I this is these are the guys that Mr. Prior talked to me about that's where I made that connection

592
00:33:59.68 --> 00:34:05.14
And I'm like I'm gonna go be a Navy seal and I didn't even know how to swim that well

593
00:34:05.14 --> 00:34:10.54
Damn yeah, I went into the recruiters office. I think the next day and you know I told him it's like hey

594
00:34:10.54 --> 00:34:15.26
You're sign up for the Navy won't be an Navy seal and of course. Oh, God you have stoked that recruit

595
00:34:15.26 --> 00:34:20.62
Oh, yeah, I was a recruiters carry out standing. Yeah, you look like you make a great Navy seal

596
00:34:21.70 --> 00:34:27.84
Exactly. Oh, yeah, this guy told me set me up for failure like yeah, so he you know

597
00:34:29.06 --> 00:34:33.18
I went through the process very quickly because I'm like hey, I'm committed. Let's do it

598
00:34:33.18 --> 00:34:35.18
You know

599
00:34:35.18 --> 00:34:37.18
And so I

600
00:34:37.18 --> 00:34:41.78
You know, I take the asvap whatever and then he gives me the the Corman rating. He's like we think about being a Corman

601
00:34:41.78 --> 00:34:44.34
I was like, well, sad. He's like oh, it's like a medic when you get out

602
00:34:44.34 --> 00:34:47.30
You're like a registered nurse and you can have a job. I was like, oh, okay cool

603
00:34:47.30 --> 00:34:52.10
So when I get out I'll have a skill so I'll be the medic on the team so I'm like, yeah, let's do it

604
00:34:52.90 --> 00:34:54.90
So

605
00:34:54.90 --> 00:34:56.90
Were you in the dot

606
00:34:56.90 --> 00:35:00.02
Well, you did you get some kind of a seal contract like how they didn't have that back then

607
00:35:00.02 --> 00:35:04.58
But here here's the thing I didn't know anything so this recruiter told me screwed me over one

608
00:35:04.58 --> 00:35:05.86
I wasn't a citizen

609
00:35:05.86 --> 00:35:10.02
So you can't be in the teams without being but you know this part of it will come into play

610
00:35:10.86 --> 00:35:12.86
So you know I go off to boot camp

611
00:35:13.82 --> 00:35:19.14
He ships me off on their corpsmen contracts. I go to boot camp. Yeah, so you're so just to everyone knows

612
00:35:19.42 --> 00:35:23.90
You're doing the Navy as a regular Navy dude as a corpsman and

613
00:35:23.90 --> 00:35:31.92
And that that gives you no leverage whatsoever to try and get to buzz. I mean very little leverage what year is this you think

614
00:35:31.92 --> 00:35:34.10
1999 and by the way

615
00:35:34.10 --> 00:35:38.38
I barely got into the Navy because I had I had felonies on my record

616
00:35:38.38 --> 00:35:43.54
So I had to get like multiple waivers and back then you know being the military wasn't cool

617
00:35:43.54 --> 00:35:47.26
So they were like all right, you know because I told my son now I'm like listen

618
00:35:47.26 --> 00:35:52.70
He knows I got a trouble is kid. I'm like listen. You can't do that nowadays. No, I mean you got to have secret clearances

619
00:35:52.70 --> 00:35:54.70
You got to do this. I mean you do now

620
00:35:55.38 --> 00:36:01.54
It's so their way more selective now. Oh, yeah in every branch and for seals for shirts

621
00:36:01.90 --> 00:36:08.94
Yeah, cuz there's so many kids that want to go into it. Yeah, they can to pick and choose exactly. Yeah, so

622
00:36:09.62 --> 00:36:17.02
So I go to boot camp and they have the video, you know with all the cool stuff and then I'm like this is it

623
00:36:17.02 --> 00:36:21.18
And then I who wants to try out and I raise my hand. I'm like heck yeah, this is it

624
00:36:21.18 --> 00:36:24.38
But the problem is I didn't know how to swim

625
00:36:26.46 --> 00:36:32.38
So we take the screener we take the screen and I and look I can get from one end of the boot of the other

626
00:36:32.38 --> 00:36:36.48
But I am not what you would call a good swim like I never took you know swimming classes

627
00:36:36.48 --> 00:36:40.68
I could do this right I kind of doggy my way over and I wasn't scared of the water

628
00:36:40.68 --> 00:36:45.18
I just I just wasn't good and I failed it the first time around. I was like dang dude

629
00:36:45.18 --> 00:36:50.02
What am I gonna do? You know now I'm really stressing because now I'm like damn I'm gonna go to the regular Navy

630
00:36:50.02 --> 00:36:52.02
And I was really really scared of the regular guys

631
00:36:52.02 --> 00:36:55.02
I don't want to get stuck on a ship and so they're like

632
00:36:55.90 --> 00:37:01.30
My RDC really really liked me. You know, I was her Yoman so I had I had a lot of freedom

633
00:37:01.30 --> 00:37:03.30
You know the Yoman cat like takes all the papers

634
00:37:03.30 --> 00:37:07.62
You have actually a lot of freedom in boot camp to walk around because I would deliver all the all the stuff

635
00:37:07.62 --> 00:37:09.62
Where'd you go to boot camp great legs?

636
00:37:10.10 --> 00:37:15.06
Yeah, so she was like hey, I'll let you try out one more time. I was like oh no, so I go and

637
00:37:15.06 --> 00:37:20.62
And by the way everyone in their mother's trying out so there's like 50 people in the pool. So I'm swimming

638
00:37:20.62 --> 00:37:23.58
And I'm listening to the times and I'm like oh my god

639
00:37:23.58 --> 00:37:25.58
I'm not gonna make it again

640
00:37:25.58 --> 00:37:30.38
So I just stood up at one point. I was like I'm done and they're like okay

641
00:37:30.38 --> 00:37:33.54
Get out and get ready for push-ups and pull-ups. I was like oh shit that worked

642
00:37:33.86 --> 00:37:36.70
So I got out to just cut a lot off your time

643
00:37:36.70 --> 00:37:38.70
I was like two or two

644
00:37:38.70 --> 00:37:42.58
I'm gonna say it was like at least two. I was nowhere near finishing

645
00:37:42.58 --> 00:37:46.74
And but there's so many kids in the pool. I'm like you any work like

646
00:37:46.74 --> 00:37:53.54
Had you worked out at all go so I was very athletic. Yeah, but you didn't play sports. So I played sports in high school

647
00:37:53.54 --> 00:38:00.38
Oh, okay, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the coaches school. So I played you know in PE I would play football basketball anything

648
00:38:00.38 --> 00:38:03.78
And I would catch on to it very quickly like coaches were always hitting my mom-up

649
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:08.22
Did you play any sports for the school? No, I wasn't allowed to so it's just PE yeah

650
00:38:08.22 --> 00:38:14.02
And that's why the coaches because the coaches are usually the PE teachers call my mom and they're like hey

651
00:38:14.02 --> 00:38:18.02
Like you're son really needs to play football. I really need to do that because I was really athletic

652
00:38:18.02 --> 00:38:24.30
I was fast and I was functionally strong because I did so many chores that I was I was a very pretty strong kid

653
00:38:24.30 --> 00:38:26.30
You know for my age so

654
00:38:26.30 --> 00:38:30.26
So I was athletic. I could do push-ups all day pull-ups all day, you know, I could run

655
00:38:30.26 --> 00:38:33.10
I just can swim so when I got out, you know

656
00:38:33.10 --> 00:38:36.98
I crushed the pull-ups and push-ups and everything else and so I'm going through the process and then

657
00:38:36.98 --> 00:38:40.78
The dive motivators like hey just so you know

658
00:38:40.78 --> 00:38:46.58
Corment or not it's not a seal rating it was the only year that they did it were for whatever reason

659
00:38:46.78 --> 00:38:50.86
They were like if you want to be a Corment with the teams you got to go to the Marines first

660
00:38:51.30 --> 00:38:58.42
So I was like, I don't want to do that so I went to the office and I changed my rating to like a boat

661
00:38:58.42 --> 00:39:02.50
It's made and then I go back and I'm like hey, you know

662
00:39:02.50 --> 00:39:07.86
I'm a seal rating now and he's like cool now and get you in and then as he's doing my paperwork he's like you're not a citizen

663
00:39:08.18 --> 00:39:10.18
You can't go

664
00:39:10.18 --> 00:39:11.38
I'm like dang it

665
00:39:11.38 --> 00:39:15.30
So I go back I changed it back to a Corment because I know what a boat's made is

666
00:39:15.62 --> 00:39:18.34
So I go back I change it back to a Corment and

667
00:39:19.06 --> 00:39:20.66
You know they're like hey sorry man

668
00:39:20.66 --> 00:39:23.94
We really liked you, but you got to get your citizenship first so

669
00:39:24.86 --> 00:39:28.38
From there I went to course school and then from course school

670
00:39:28.38 --> 00:39:32.78
Where where where do you end up with the Marines, right? Yeah, yep

671
00:39:32.78 --> 00:39:36.78
So about the majority of the Corment especially if you're male you're gonna go to the Marines

672
00:39:36.78 --> 00:39:40.62
So they sent me to school called FMSS where they basically teach you how to be a Marine

673
00:39:40.62 --> 00:39:42.62
You know teach you like Marine Corps

674
00:39:42.62 --> 00:39:48.70
Like ranks etiquette whatever and then at one point they they ask if you want to go Marine Corps regs

675
00:39:49.10 --> 00:39:53.18
Which is basically you got to cut your hair like them and if you do you get like to where they're they're green

676
00:39:53.18 --> 00:39:58.78
uniform I forget what they're called and they're and like everybody was like super moto and then yeah

677
00:39:58.78 --> 00:40:01.90
I want to be Marine Corps rags and then they're like what about you Mendez?

678
00:40:01.90 --> 00:40:03.66
You want to be Marine Corps rags? And I was like no

679
00:40:04.46 --> 00:40:07.74
And like but you get a uniform you get to wear the Marine Corps uniform

680
00:40:08.06 --> 00:40:13.34
I'm like I got enough uniforms because before you had to always carry them around in your sea bag and you had inspections all the time

681
00:40:13.34 --> 00:40:15.34
I'm like I don't want another uniform

682
00:40:16.62 --> 00:40:20.38
And it was right around that time where I met the the recon Corment that was there

683
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:22.38
I

684
00:40:22.38 --> 00:40:27.18
Mean you just looked at him he just looked like a stud so I immediately gravitated towards him and

685
00:40:27.74 --> 00:40:31.90
And then he's like hey just so you know we're gonna have triodes if you want to be a recon Corment at the time

686
00:40:31.90 --> 00:40:37.18
They were like 40% man like we're really hurting we could really use people so I go and I try out

687
00:40:38.14 --> 00:40:40.14
And I feel this one again

688
00:40:41.18 --> 00:40:48.78
But you know he's like hey man get out do the rest of it and and that screener was actually legit like it was tough

689
00:40:48.78 --> 00:40:51.58
Like it was a rock run it was like pull ups push ups

690
00:40:51.90 --> 00:40:57.18
It was like the Marine Corps PFT and then it was like all these different calisthenics with with no number

691
00:40:57.74 --> 00:41:01.42
You just did it for time and they had a number that they wouldn't tell you

692
00:41:01.42 --> 00:41:05.42
So like hey you got to do this amount of mountain climbers and they wouldn't tell you it was like a day long

693
00:41:05.66 --> 00:41:11.02
Screener and I passed everything else like I crushed everything else and he was like hey I'll tell you what

694
00:41:11.50 --> 00:41:14.94
He's like you haven't till the end of FMSs to pass the swim

695
00:41:14.94 --> 00:41:19.66
He's like you're obviously you know athletic you have the physical ability to do it just can't swim

696
00:41:20.14 --> 00:41:26.38
So I'm like okay perfect and at one point I remember going in his office and doing like the dive physical and get my chest

697
00:41:26.38 --> 00:41:28.46
X-ray and whatnot somehow through conversation

698
00:41:28.46 --> 00:41:30.46
I was like yeah, I want to go to Buds

699
00:41:30.86 --> 00:41:35.90
He's like you want to do what he's like I was like I want to go to Buds eventually like I'm just kind of doing this

700
00:41:35.90 --> 00:41:38.94
You know my time with the Marines and until I could get the Buds and

701
00:41:39.50 --> 00:41:44.06
He grabs my paperwork. He like crumbles it up and he's like he will never

702
00:41:44.06 --> 00:41:47.82
Be a reconquerman and he chugged my stuff in the garbage

703
00:41:48.22 --> 00:41:53.10
He's like yeah, I'm office that was it. I was like oh, so yeah, so

704
00:41:54.06 --> 00:41:56.06
Then I got orders to

705
00:41:56.06 --> 00:42:01.66
24 I'm so grunt grunt battalion there in camp Pendleton and as soon as I get there

706
00:42:02.22 --> 00:42:08.46
I'm like really regretting it. I'm like dang what I do you know maybe I should have just kept my mouth shut and just gone with it

707
00:42:09.58 --> 00:42:12.06
And as soon as I get there, that's usually good advice

708
00:42:12.06 --> 00:42:15.26
Yeah, yeah, this is a my favorite. All right, and so

709
00:42:15.90 --> 00:42:18.70
As soon as I get to 24 they're already like hey, we're getting ready to deploy

710
00:42:19.10 --> 00:42:24.22
So I basically I didn't do a work of branding. I basically just I think I was home from maybe a month and then we deployed

711
00:42:24.78 --> 00:42:29.42
to Japan my first deployment and what are you doing or what are you doing on deployment

712
00:42:29.98 --> 00:42:31.74
Would you exercise this and stuff?

713
00:42:31.74 --> 00:42:34.86
So I was like the the coverage corpsman and and you know

714
00:42:35.26 --> 00:42:39.90
My chief knew that I wanted to go to Buds so he would attach me to like the amphibious assault

715
00:42:39.90 --> 00:42:43.74
Platoon or whatever like whether they did all the boat stuff and OTV stuff

716
00:42:44.30 --> 00:42:45.58
So I did that

717
00:42:45.58 --> 00:42:49.66
Was like their their corpsman basically if anybody got hurt. I was the corpsman coverage for that

718
00:42:50.14 --> 00:42:56.14
But during that deployment that's where I like got really serious about learning how to swim and I was in the pool every chance

719
00:42:56.14 --> 00:43:00.70
I could get like if if I had the time I would go in the mornings I would go a lunch and that's why

720
00:43:01.02 --> 00:43:03.82
Oh, because it was a guy that I met that dropped out of Buds and

721
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:09.50
Hmm and I told him I was like do you know how to do the combat sidestroke and he's like yeah, I was like teach me

722
00:43:11.34 --> 00:43:15.82
So he taught me and and that's where I I got proficient at that swimming was during that deployment

723
00:43:17.50 --> 00:43:20.30
This is still pre 9 11. Oh, it's just all

724
00:43:21.02 --> 00:43:27.18
Contrary yeah, just going on training missions and big exercises and so that's a normal sex month deployment you go on with the Marines

725
00:43:27.18 --> 00:43:32.70
Yeah, pretty unhavenful get done with that and what happened to you come home from that so I come home and then

726
00:43:32.70 --> 00:43:38.62
We get a new chief and we start talking and then he's like hey, have you ever thought about going recon

727
00:43:40.70 --> 00:43:43.90
I was like you have thought about it, you know, but I want to go to Buds or whatever

728
00:43:43.90 --> 00:43:50.70
He's like hey, won't you have the conversation with this this recon chief and so the recon chief and I start talking and then he's like

729
00:43:51.26 --> 00:43:53.90
He's like hey, we have a guy here who's not really working out and

730
00:43:54.62 --> 00:44:00.70
We want to see if you want to come over here and I told him I'm like hey, I want to be honest. You like my goal is to go to Buds

731
00:44:00.70 --> 00:44:07.18
He's like hey listen, no problem. He's like, won't you come over here? See if you like it if you like it stay if not I'll send you to Buds

732
00:44:07.58 --> 00:44:09.58
And I was like okay, and then he's like

733
00:44:09.90 --> 00:44:11.98
He's like if you come over here, I'll give you BH

734
00:44:12.46 --> 00:44:14.46
Which as an email

735
00:44:15.10 --> 00:44:17.10
Basic allows for housing

736
00:44:17.10 --> 00:44:22.54
But it's legit money. No, it could be like 1200 bucks a month

737
00:44:22.94 --> 00:44:25.90
Yeah, and when you're what were you for you? Oh, you're an E4 you're

738
00:44:26.62 --> 00:44:30.14
Sorta like maybe almost doubling your paycheck not quite maybe like

739
00:44:30.14 --> 00:44:32.14
50% of your pay

740
00:44:32.46 --> 00:44:38.78
You're gonna you're gonna make extra. It's a big deal getting that BH that's why dudes get married by the way

741
00:44:39.18 --> 00:44:44.54
Dude, that's why you see 18-year-old Marines are like you're up and getting married. Oh, you met the woman your dreams

742
00:44:44.54 --> 00:44:48.38
No, but I'm gonna get be a bitch son. They want that BH

743
00:44:49.34 --> 00:44:53.34
Yeah, so it's a big deal especially in the Marines because in the Marines

744
00:44:53.34 --> 00:44:57.82
That the the barracks had to be like 95% man and you had to be like an E5 or above

745
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:02.46
And so I'm an E4 and he's like BH and some magic words. I'm like let's do it

746
00:45:03.34 --> 00:45:09.58
So I headed over there and and I see the guy that I'm supposed to replace and the guy looks like Superman

747
00:45:09.98 --> 00:45:14.46
I mean he's super tall just jacked and I'm like I'm replacing this guy

748
00:45:15.66 --> 00:45:20.46
And then you know I kind of like I could tell that with the LPO there kind of saw I was like oh dang

749
00:45:20.62 --> 00:45:24.30
You know, I was like this guy and he's like his yeah, he looks like Superman, right?

750
00:45:24.30 --> 00:45:27.98
I was like yeah, he does he's like you know what's his kryptonite water? Oh

751
00:45:29.26 --> 00:45:31.58
I guess he would he would freak out during the water

752
00:45:31.58 --> 00:45:36.22
But because they had him like tread water with but they do a lot of stuff over there with water and and um

753
00:45:36.54 --> 00:45:39.10
Yeah, yes, he would just like freak out. So I'm like okay cool

754
00:45:40.06 --> 00:45:42.78
So that's how I ended up there. Um, they put me right into

755
00:45:44.62 --> 00:45:47.74
My first introduction to them was it was it was an SR

756
00:45:48.46 --> 00:45:50.86
So they were like hey, you're gonna do an O T B S R

757
00:45:50.86 --> 00:45:57.02
Yeah, penultimate yeah penultimate I just been there. I just got there and there was a cornman there who had at the

758
00:45:57.02 --> 00:45:59.26
Reconbite time who who had orders to go to Buds

759
00:46:00.06 --> 00:46:05.90
So they're they're like hey, can you take you know Carlos under your wing kind of show him how to pack out for an O T B S R

760
00:46:06.78 --> 00:46:11.50
And by the way, I've never swam in the ocean before so now I'm about to you know at night get dropped off

761
00:46:11.90 --> 00:46:17.42
Swim to the surf zone. Yeah with with the rock load out. Oh, yeah, which is no joke

762
00:46:17.42 --> 00:46:23.50
Normus so he's like teaching me how to like load my stuff out and then I'm like hey what about like warm weather stuff

763
00:46:23.82 --> 00:46:25.82
He's like this is Reconbroad

764
00:46:27.02 --> 00:46:32.38
And then by the way, this is winter time and and um he's like this is Reconbroad like we don't take that stuff

765
00:46:32.38 --> 00:46:33.74
And I'm like okay, you know

766
00:46:33.74 --> 00:46:38.54
Like check he's like we take batteries and this and that he's like I'm like okay got it

767
00:46:38.54 --> 00:46:43.26
And then I'm like hey question how am I getting this brok through the surf because of that

768
00:46:43.26 --> 00:46:47.90
He's like oh you can put a floatation on it. I put a ton of floatation on my cuz I'm like down on a drown

769
00:46:49.18 --> 00:46:50.78
So we go and we do the SR

770
00:46:51.34 --> 00:46:57.74
I make it through the surf zone just sheer will but I mean I must have swallowed like a gallon of water going to the

771
00:46:57.74 --> 00:47:00.70
Surfzone my first time ever but I you know, I'm trying not to be

772
00:47:01.74 --> 00:47:03.74
The weak link

773
00:47:03.74 --> 00:47:06.86
If you know yeah, I'm trying not to be a ffina

774
00:47:07.50 --> 00:47:12.62
So we make it through and you know we change out we start patrolling and then we get to to the

775
00:47:12.62 --> 00:47:14.62
To the place where we're gonna

776
00:47:14.78 --> 00:47:20.78
Set up camp and then everybody starts busing out their warmings. Yeah, they were and I look around on my

777
00:47:22.22 --> 00:47:25.74
Damn it and then I like hey, what's up doc like where's your stuff?

778
00:47:26.06 --> 00:47:27.58
I'm like where we gone

779
00:47:27.98 --> 00:47:34.30
I thought that we didn't bring warmings out and they like no way bro like we bring a ton of warmings out

780
00:47:34.86 --> 00:47:36.86
Now I'm just like oh

781
00:47:36.86 --> 00:47:41.02
And I'm freezing cold because it's winter time out camp in Otenham

782
00:47:41.02 --> 00:47:46.62
We just went through the surf so I'm still wet and finally I'm just like you know what I'm gonna volunteer to just watch the radio on night

783
00:47:46.94 --> 00:47:49.82
I was like there's no way I'm sleeping tonight and so I did I just

784
00:47:50.78 --> 00:47:56.70
Jack hammered all night long watched the radio and we'd get up and walk around just try to keep my self warm

785
00:47:56.86 --> 00:48:01.50
And the Marines loved it, you know, because I volunteered to do watch all night long for for the rest of this star

786
00:48:01.50 --> 00:48:03.50
But that was my introduction

787
00:48:03.90 --> 00:48:07.18
I was I when I got to the teams. I was a new guy didn't have my bird yet

788
00:48:07.18 --> 00:48:18.62
And I got sent to a comm school out on the east coast that was run by by the teams and I was a new guy and my butt my swim buddy was a new guy two of us and we

789
00:48:19.82 --> 00:48:25.54
We there was like a six day five or six day FTX that you went on at the end of this comm school

790
00:48:25.54 --> 00:48:28.38
It's a two month comm school's freaking legit. It was a great course and

791
00:48:29.34 --> 00:48:31.58
The chief that was running it

792
00:48:31.58 --> 00:48:38.30
You know, I was like asking him questions cuz I always want to know you know what would be a good thing to bring when we're in the field and I said

793
00:48:38.30 --> 00:48:40.54
Hey, you know, or guy, you know, should I bring like a sleeping bag?

794
00:48:40.54 --> 00:48:42.46
Should I and he goes if you're hard core will it?

795
00:48:42.46 --> 00:48:46.94
Because you know I was always trying to be hard core. He's like your hard core will like he was bringing a punch on a poncho liner

796
00:48:46.94 --> 00:48:49.74
And I was like well check. I am fucking hardcore

797
00:48:49.74 --> 00:48:52.94
And I'm just bringing on a poncho to a poncho liner and I did and

798
00:48:53.50 --> 00:48:56.38
That's what I went out and field with and as we inserted

799
00:48:56.38 --> 00:49:04.30
The first night it was raining as we inserted it turned to sleep like as the vehicles pulled up to drop us off and then it turned into snow

800
00:49:04.70 --> 00:49:07.98
It was balls called balls called and

801
00:49:08.74 --> 00:49:11.98
On this course you had like a comms window every

802
00:49:12.78 --> 00:49:16.62
Every two to four hours you'd have to make comms to some different part of the country and

803
00:49:17.86 --> 00:49:23.82
Most guys would like miss comm windows and that would be you're getting graded the whole time and if you had the best grade at the end

804
00:49:23.82 --> 00:49:25.82
Then you get extracted early and

805
00:49:25.82 --> 00:49:27.82
And so

806
00:49:27.82 --> 00:49:31.34
Me my swim buddy same thing like we were we were trying to be hardcore

807
00:49:31.42 --> 00:49:34.62
So we didn't have warm is for shit. We freezing and

808
00:49:35.74 --> 00:49:39.02
We never missed a comm window and the reason we never missed a comm window is because we couldn't

809
00:49:39.58 --> 00:49:41.34
It was just like freezing

810
00:49:41.34 --> 00:49:45.66
But yeah, that's um always bring a ground pad and always bring a bivy sack

811
00:49:45.66 --> 00:49:49.90
Because that's what I learned eventually the bivy sack is the deal if you got a bivy sack

812
00:49:49.90 --> 00:49:54.70
You can climb in there and you can pretty much just gut through some serious shit

813
00:49:54.70 --> 00:50:00.46
Yeah, but um yeah, that's good. That's the way that's what that's what happens to the new guys

814
00:50:00.54 --> 00:50:04.62
Yeah, don't believe when your chief says you we don't bring warmies

815
00:50:04.94 --> 00:50:09.82
These foolish shit. Yeah, well actually the the recon coming that were they they were cool about it

816
00:50:09.82 --> 00:50:11.90
Because they're like hey, we heard what happened like dude

817
00:50:12.22 --> 00:50:14.78
I'm not gonna say the guy's name. He's like he totally hooked you up

818
00:50:15.42 --> 00:50:17.42
All right, yeah, he did

819
00:50:18.30 --> 00:50:22.94
So at that point they put me into rip which is the recon doctoration puttons

820
00:50:22.94 --> 00:50:26.62
So basically it's you competing for a slot at their at BRC

821
00:50:27.02 --> 00:50:32.54
Which is like their selection process and that's a bonus is it still in corn out of it's in camp Hamilton

822
00:50:32.54 --> 00:50:37.74
Okay, so rip is in camp Hamilton. What's the one I used there used to be something corn that's BRC God so in rip

823
00:50:38.22 --> 00:50:42.30
They put everybody in there who just showed up to the talent and you're come because there's only 30 slots

824
00:50:42.30 --> 00:50:43.66
So you're competing

825
00:50:43.66 --> 00:50:50.70
So the top 30 guys go to BRC if you didn't make that cut you go through rip again and hopefully you make it through the you know

826
00:50:50.70 --> 00:50:55.90
You're in top 30 now long as rip so it did there's no like real timeline to it

827
00:50:55.90 --> 00:50:58.46
I think it was just like hey, you're just doing it until the next class

828
00:50:59.02 --> 00:51:03.34
The BRC shows up and then they start ranking you and then you get your your slot

829
00:51:04.14 --> 00:51:08.06
And so you know the common one like hey just you know like you know Marines are always harder on the

830
00:51:08.06 --> 00:51:14.78
Corbin don't let us down and so I go to rip and I'm doing well on everything except for land now

831
00:51:14.78 --> 00:51:20.30
I can't freaking land now to save my life dude. I was just getting lost and I was really getting down on myself and

832
00:51:20.86 --> 00:51:24.46
And then one day I just clicked like I looked at the map and I'm just like

833
00:51:25.18 --> 00:51:31.18
It came to life. I get it. Yeah. I don't know it was just like this moment like a light bulb moment and from that point on like I was like land

834
00:51:31.18 --> 00:51:32.38
I've got it

835
00:51:32.38 --> 00:51:35.34
So I was able to secure a spot to BRC

836
00:51:36.38 --> 00:51:41.14
So I go to BRC which is in corn out of and that's what I start seeing like the blood's guys and I'm like

837
00:51:41.14 --> 00:51:47.54
Dang you know which I was here, but I'm here now and you know I did pretty well and BRC

838
00:51:47.86 --> 00:51:55.14
There was a guy there named Mendoza and he was not good at all and the instructors would get us confused

839
00:51:55.70 --> 00:51:58.58
And so I would be running by and like hey you drop

840
00:51:58.98 --> 00:52:03.94
That was like okay and like wish I heard you lost your map and this and that and I was like that was in me

841
00:52:03.94 --> 00:52:05.94
That was Mendoza and they're like oh

842
00:52:05.94 --> 00:52:12.42
Like we'll push him out anyways, you know and then finally this guy I don't remember if he quit or if he got dropped

843
00:52:12.42 --> 00:52:14.98
But thank goodness because then once he got dropped

844
00:52:14.98 --> 00:52:18.10
I'm just like cool because he was just messing up left and right and they would get us confused

845
00:52:18.66 --> 00:52:21.62
Mendoza so I had to pay the man a few times for his

846
00:52:22.34 --> 00:52:24.10
And then sometimes they're like you know what both of you

847
00:52:25.14 --> 00:52:26.90
Just pay the man how long is BRC?

848
00:52:27.94 --> 00:52:30.98
If I remember correctly back then I think it was like two months long

849
00:52:30.98 --> 00:52:39.38
And so you obviously you finished it. I did not I actually got a stress fracture about two weeks from graduating and

850
00:52:40.18 --> 00:52:46.74
You know they they sent me back to the to the BAS with the corpsman. I got to X-ray and everything like yeah

851
00:52:46.98 --> 00:52:52.98
And at the time you know there's they were like hey how was he doing and like actually he's he ranked number one in the class before he got dropped

852
00:52:52.98 --> 00:52:54.98
So he's like he's welcome to come back and

853
00:52:54.98 --> 00:53:00.90
And then at that point that I hate you want to go back and I said no as I got want to go to Buds

854
00:53:01.94 --> 00:53:06.66
I made my decision that was like here. I want to do this like because here's the thing like if you finish

855
00:53:08.42 --> 00:53:13.62
Now you owe them time because after that they sent us to you finish then you sent you to jump school

856
00:53:13.62 --> 00:53:16.66
Diive school and now you belong to them because they've invested money into you

857
00:53:17.86 --> 00:53:20.98
And it was kind of funny too because when I went they were like

858
00:53:20.98 --> 00:53:28.98
Somehow it came up that I wasn't a citizen and they were like oh shit. You're not a citizen like you actually weren't supposed to go to BRC if you weren't

859
00:53:28.98 --> 00:53:34.90
So they were like let's get you some citizenship so they they kind of fast track me and I was able to get my citizenship

860
00:53:35.38 --> 00:53:38.90
And so they're like hey for the rest of the time here, you know, we're just gonna attach you to a platoon

861
00:53:39.86 --> 00:53:43.94
And so they improved you going about they were like all right, that's what you wanted to do. Yeah, they were really yeah

862
00:53:43.94 --> 00:53:49.14
They were awesome about it. They got great leadership there. They were great great like super professional guys

863
00:53:49.14 --> 00:53:51.14
I still keep in touch with some of them

864
00:53:51.54 --> 00:53:54.42
So hey, it's all you what we're gonna do till you get orders and you go

865
00:53:54.42 --> 00:53:58.58
We're just gonna put you an uplatoon and you're gonna do work up deployment and you just be the corpsman

866
00:53:58.58 --> 00:54:02.50
And then when you get your orders to go to buds you go so

867
00:54:03.54 --> 00:54:08.18
That's what I did until I got orders to go to buns. What are you worried about this stress fractures scenario?

868
00:54:08.50 --> 00:54:11.58
Because like that's all kinds of people get stress fractures but I

869
00:54:12.58 --> 00:54:15.58
Wasn't because I I never you know

870
00:54:15.58 --> 00:54:22.14
I was like oh, I'll heal up on me young no factor. Yeah, so I got orders to go to buds in

871
00:54:23.58 --> 00:54:25.58
November of 2003

872
00:54:25.58 --> 00:54:31.58
Right or 2002 sorry 2002 November of 2002 so where were you when when 9-11 happened?

873
00:54:31.58 --> 00:54:39.34
I was at the for reconbetian, but they were like hey, I don't think we got deployed or anybody from that battalion got deployed

874
00:54:40.22 --> 00:54:42.22
Um

875
00:54:42.22 --> 00:54:45.42
To have can't stand at that time, but I that was still there

876
00:54:45.66 --> 00:54:50.14
But you know at that time already had my path so they're like hey even if you go there

877
00:54:50.14 --> 00:54:53.68
You're not gonna go with the football town so then when do you when do you get the buds finally?

878
00:54:54.22 --> 00:54:56.22
November of 2002

879
00:54:57.34 --> 00:54:59.34
What you expected

880
00:54:59.34 --> 00:55:06.14
I was you must have been pretty freaking kind of ready for it. Oh, oh, yeah, I had I had run with a rock

881
00:55:06.14 --> 00:55:10.06
I'd done OTV's countless OTV's. I was really good at land-out

882
00:55:10.06 --> 00:55:15.26
I mean like I got attached to a platoon did a workup to point with them so I was I was ready

883
00:55:16.22 --> 00:55:17.02
Um

884
00:55:17.02 --> 00:55:21.34
And so when I showed it like oh here's the thing to they they sent me to like a

885
00:55:22.06 --> 00:55:24.46
Like a combat engine here in battalion

886
00:55:24.46 --> 00:55:28.22
They're like hey, we're gonna send you they can't be in the platoon anymore because they're about to deploy and

887
00:55:28.94 --> 00:55:33.82
You know obviously it's gonna overlap you're gonna start buds before when I'm gonna bring you home halfway through deployment

888
00:55:33.82 --> 00:55:39.18
So they're like go to this combat engineer in battalion and you can work out all day and that's where I met this guy named Captain Gwen

889
00:55:40.86 --> 00:55:45.98
Who had like a master's degree in can easyology and was all about in the fitness and when he learned that I was going to buds

890
00:55:45.98 --> 00:55:47.98
He's like let me train you

891
00:55:47.98 --> 00:55:55.58
I was like your series. He's like yeah, so he got me even more prepared like we worked out three times a day in the morning at lunch and afterwards

892
00:55:55.82 --> 00:56:00.30
And then he started teaching me how to eat properly. So when I got to buds I was

893
00:56:00.30 --> 00:56:07.18
I was ready like I could do 30 more pull ups 120 push up 120 set like I was I was a machine when I got there

894
00:56:08.22 --> 00:56:15.26
And your water had obviously improved. Oh, yeah, yeah, I have at that point I'd done countless OTVs and yeah, that was good to go

895
00:56:16.22 --> 00:56:19.82
And then did you get what you expected there in buds any any issues or anything

896
00:56:21.02 --> 00:56:23.98
So when I got there, I'm like, you know everybody tells you oh you got to be the gray man

897
00:56:23.98 --> 00:56:25.98
So I'm like okay cool. I'm gonna be the gray man

898
00:56:25.98 --> 00:56:33.34
But if I gray man people that don't know this is just a term to to explain if you can go to buds and you can kind of

899
00:56:33.98 --> 00:56:36.78
Not stand out that's a good thing because

900
00:56:37.74 --> 00:56:44.06
There's very few people that stand there's only might be one or two maybe three people in a class that stand out because they're good

901
00:56:44.94 --> 00:56:48.94
But the people that stand out because they're bad and then once you got someone watching you

902
00:56:49.34 --> 00:56:53.42
Yeah, then every you're they're gonna start seeing all kinds of things that you're doing that are jacked up so

903
00:56:53.42 --> 00:56:55.42
one of the

904
00:56:55.58 --> 00:57:02.54
Strategies of going to buds is to try to be the quote gray man meaning just be in the middle

905
00:57:03.18 --> 00:57:06.62
Finish the stuff don't stand out don't draw any attention to yourself and

906
00:57:07.18 --> 00:57:11.50
That's a good strategy for getting through and you would hurt. I don't think we had that

907
00:57:11.50 --> 00:57:13.50
I don't think that was a term when I went through

908
00:57:14.14 --> 00:57:16.54
But I kind of instinctively well

909
00:57:16.54 --> 00:57:23.90
Everyone instinctively knew you didn't want the freedom instructors to know your name or your face or you just wanted them to ignore you as much

910
00:57:23.90 --> 00:57:27.18
Sponsibal so you know you just try to do what you're told and try and you know

911
00:57:27.18 --> 00:57:30.54
Yeah, try not to stand out and that was the plan. I'm like all right

912
00:57:30.54 --> 00:57:33.50
I'm not gonna shine you know I'm just gonna stay like the top 25%

913
00:57:34.62 --> 00:57:37.58
But that was not possible because

914
00:57:38.38 --> 00:57:42.86
When I first got to buds you know you're standing watch when you're waiting to class up and

915
00:57:42.86 --> 00:57:47.26
You know a buddy of mine there and buzz like hey, let's go out one night

916
00:57:47.58 --> 00:57:51.98
You know, let's be before we go out so we go out we party and how old are you?

917
00:57:53.02 --> 00:57:59.42
22 yeah 2002. I'm 22. I was like I was young so I couldn't know what's going out. Wasn't the thing

918
00:57:59.42 --> 00:58:03.42
I could go into the the bar the the E club on base you could drink when you're 18

919
00:58:03.82 --> 00:58:07.50
But I wouldn't even want to do that. I was just trying to make it through buds. So it's weird to me

920
00:58:07.98 --> 00:58:12.14
It would've been it's weird to me like having a guy like hey, let's go out to a bar

921
00:58:12.14 --> 00:58:15.66
Because I can't fathom what it would be like to go to a bar when I was in Buds yeah

922
00:58:15.98 --> 00:58:18.78
So we go out and he starts talking to this girl

923
00:58:19.42 --> 00:58:24.86
And then he's like hey, bro like I need you to you know, our friend really likes you like I need you to

924
00:58:25.34 --> 00:58:28.94
To entertain her while I'm with this girl and blah, blah, blah, I'm like do you not got a girlfriend?

925
00:58:29.02 --> 00:58:31.98
He's like come on man. We're gonna be in the teams like you're supposed to have my back

926
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:36.62
You know what if you don't want to be known as that guy and I'm like really like you're gonna play that card with me

927
00:58:36.62 --> 00:58:43.34
So I'm like dude. I'm not dead. You know, I'll talk to her. I'll keep her busy free, but I could tell she's enemy like she wants

928
00:58:44.46 --> 00:58:48.14
She she wants more and he's like dude. We're gonna go back to their place

929
00:58:48.70 --> 00:58:53.66
And I'm like dude. I really don't want to he's like bro come on. You gotta do this for me

930
00:58:53.66 --> 00:58:56.86
I'm like listen, I think she wants more than what I'm willing to give

931
00:58:57.66 --> 00:59:01.34
Because one I wasn't attracted or two, you know, I had a girlfriend at the time and then um

932
00:59:02.06 --> 00:59:05.42
So I'm like all right dude like I'll go I'll go back to their house with you and

933
00:59:05.42 --> 00:59:11.26
When we get there I see her car and it has a first recomb Italian sticker on it

934
00:59:11.82 --> 00:59:12.86
Oh

935
00:59:12.86 --> 00:59:18.70
And I recognize that sticker because it's a sticker for different parking lots. You had different stickers and that was like an operator sticker

936
00:59:18.70 --> 00:59:21.02
Like if you got the parking the operator parking lot

937
00:59:22.14 --> 00:59:24.14
And so I was like hey where'd you get that sticker from

938
00:59:25.18 --> 00:59:29.02
She's like oh yeah, I could tell she's getting flushed and she's like my husband

939
00:59:30.22 --> 00:59:32.22
In my head

940
00:59:32.22 --> 00:59:37.42
Just like yotsie. This is my out and I'm like bro we can not do this we gotta go

941
00:59:37.90 --> 00:59:42.54
I was like I am not doing it now I have a legit reason to not go through with this

942
00:59:43.26 --> 00:59:45.74
So we take off we go back to buds and

943
00:59:46.78 --> 00:59:50.78
Now I'm standing watch on on Monday morning and I get a phone call

944
00:59:51.02 --> 00:59:55.74
I'm I'm standing watch at the quarter deck with another guy and I get a phone call from the

So then my buddy's like dude, he said it over there and he's he's big he's a huge dude. I'm like oh my god

960
01:01:07.82 --> 01:01:13.34
So I'm sitting there and then another guy that I'm with he's like bro you have to tell the instructor

961
01:01:13.34 --> 01:01:18.38
You have to tell the OD he's like there's no way you get no fire here on the quartet you're done

962
01:01:19.50 --> 01:01:22.22
And the OD happens to be a first phase instructor that day

963
01:01:22.22 --> 01:01:27.82
Yeah, so I'm just like oh my goodness so I'm like all right

01:01:28.54 --> 01:01:30.86
So I go to the first phase office, you know, I ring the bell

968
01:01:42.14 --> 01:01:46.06
So I go in there and at that time all the instructor to buds were like enormous

969
01:01:46.06 --> 01:01:52.70
They're all like six to enough just jacked out of their minds like I'm just swear they do it on purpose for intimidation factor

970
01:01:52.70 --> 01:01:54.70
But at the time they were all enormous

971
01:01:55.02 --> 01:02:00.70
So I go in there and they're like dropped her so I'm in the push-up position and my dress blues, you know, and then like what do you want?

972
01:02:00.94 --> 01:02:03.58
I'm just like marines coming over to kick my ass

973
01:02:04.86 --> 01:02:07.58
And they're like you just screw his old lady or something

974
01:02:07.58 --> 01:02:14.94
I was like nobody thinks I did and they're like like who's this marine coming over here starts some shit like let's go there beat his ass

975
01:02:14.94 --> 01:02:20.46
So the entire first phase staff's like yeah, let's go over there. So they all head over there to the quarter-deck

976
01:02:20.46 --> 01:02:26.78
And at the time there's like some guys from like team five that were waiting there to to screen for another team and

977
01:02:27.18 --> 01:02:29.66
Some of them knew each other so like, you know what's up with up?

978
01:02:29.66 --> 01:02:33.74
I'm like oh, you know, so brain coming over here starts some shit. I'm like hell yeah, the beat is ass

979
01:02:34.70 --> 01:02:41.98
So now I'm like yeah, come on over here, you know, and and so we're waiting and nothing happens and I'm like do you where is this guy?

980
01:02:41.98 --> 01:02:47.02
And then the phone rings and my buddy from 618 he's like hey, bro

981
01:02:47.02 --> 01:02:48.86
I heard what happened. I was totally messing with you

982
01:02:50.78 --> 01:02:53.78
And I could literally my

983
01:02:55.50 --> 01:03:01.66
The blood just like drained from my face and then the instructor's like is it him?

984
01:03:02.70 --> 01:03:10.38
And I was just like I just I I didn't I couldn't speak so I just handed him the phone and then he's like

985
01:03:10.38 --> 01:03:15.82
Disattractor so-and-so who is this? He's like oh, this is airmen so-and-so like where's the marine?

986
01:03:16.30 --> 01:03:20.30
He's like it was a joke. He's like oh you got jokes

987
01:03:21.10 --> 01:03:27.18
I got jokes too. He's like you and Mendez in your wetsuits two canteens on the grind

988
01:03:27.82 --> 01:03:29.82
Good song. Oh yeah

989
01:03:30.94 --> 01:03:32.94
We got beat

990
01:03:33.50 --> 01:03:35.50
He ended up quitting shortly thereafter

991
01:03:35.50 --> 01:03:37.50
Um

992
01:03:37.74 --> 01:03:39.74
But there was no being the gray man

993
01:03:39.74 --> 01:03:46.38
The only way you were the man. Oh, yeah, and it was just like from that point on I would be like where's Mendez does a matter hit the sir

994
01:03:47.26 --> 01:03:49.42
All you pasture uniform detection that's great

995
01:03:49.66 --> 01:03:54.72
It's surfing so yeah, so I was like all right. Well if I'm not gonna be the gray man just go balls out. I guess

996
01:03:54.72 --> 01:03:56.72
I was well freaking legit

997
01:03:58.38 --> 01:04:01.02
So you're not the gray man anymore and

998
01:04:02.38 --> 01:04:04.38
You're going just going hard

999
01:04:04.38 --> 01:04:08.46
Is there was any she having issues in boats? Yeah, I did

1000
01:04:10.06 --> 01:04:15.78
No, no, it's fun. Finds issues man. Yeah fine jeries. Yeah, you know during one of the surf passage

1001
01:04:16.86 --> 01:04:23.30
Evolutions I had one of the paddles come across and like break across my shin and so I had this huge bruise on my shin for a while and I was like you know

1002
01:04:23.30 --> 01:04:28.46
Whatever and I just kept going through training and at one point I realized that

1003
01:04:28.46 --> 01:04:35.66
When I would press down on my muscle it would just stay and my knee got really swollen. I could barely move it and I'm a

1004
01:04:35.66 --> 01:04:38.66
Corment so I know I'm like do these are like

1005
01:04:39.98 --> 01:04:45.18
Symptoms with compartments syndrome but I didn't want to say anything so I made it to the weekend

1006
01:04:45.18 --> 01:04:50.70
And I went back up to the to the recon battalion and I'm like hey guys like is this what I think it is?

1007
01:04:50.70 --> 01:04:52.70
And I like I think it is like do you need to go to the hospital?

1008
01:04:52.70 --> 01:04:56.06
So I was like well, I don't want to go to butks and I want to get dropped or rolled or whatever

1009
01:04:56.06 --> 01:05:00.30
So I check myself into camp penalty in hospital and then they're like

1010
01:05:00.86 --> 01:05:05.02
Dude you got to get this drain you either have to have surgery. You have to get this drained and I was like

1011
01:05:05.58 --> 01:05:10.54
Well, can we try draining it first and they're like yeah sure so they got this enormous needle

1012
01:05:10.54 --> 01:05:14.62
I mean it was thick too and they just started like draining the blood from there and they're like

1013
01:05:15.38 --> 01:05:19.74
Did you're not gonna be able to finish buds and whatever I was like no I'll be fine

1014
01:05:19.74 --> 01:05:27.98
So I go back to buds and then the instructors got word that I had checked into to medical up there in the light dude

1015
01:05:27.98 --> 01:05:29.50
We have a medical here

1016
01:05:29.50 --> 01:05:33.82
They're cool about it like I thought they were gonna be pissed but they were like hey, you know

1017
01:05:34.46 --> 01:05:36.46
They they liked me at that point

1018
01:05:36.86 --> 01:05:41.10
One phase was that first phase. Oh, this is before hell week. Dang them yeah before hell

1019
01:05:41.10 --> 01:05:45.18
So it was like the week before hell week and then they were like hey no big deal

1020
01:05:45.18 --> 01:05:47.18
We're just roll you to the next class

1021
01:05:47.18 --> 01:05:50.70
And I was like you know as it was extremely disappointing

1022
01:05:51.50 --> 01:05:56.86
So I got rolled and then I got rolled into two four five and then

1023
01:05:57.42 --> 01:05:59.02
though run

1024
01:05:59.02 --> 01:06:04.70
Before like the the last day before we started hell week on a run I stepped in a paw hole

1025
01:06:05.34 --> 01:06:08.54
Or I stepped in like you know holding the sand and I twisted my ankle

1026
01:06:09.26 --> 01:06:13.42
Really bad like that scene was enormously swollen and then

1027
01:06:13.42 --> 01:06:17.18
I was like no, it's fine like I'll go through hell week and you know I'll be fine

1028
01:06:17.58 --> 01:06:21.18
And they're like, dude you're not gonna be able to go through that and in my head I'm like this is twice now

1029
01:06:21.58 --> 01:06:23.58
There's no way they're keeping me and

1030
01:06:24.46 --> 01:06:26.46
The the proctor at the time

1031
01:06:27.18 --> 01:06:29.18
You know he's looking through my record. He's like

1032
01:06:30.30 --> 01:06:36.78
Dude you haven't failed a single evolution here like not a uniform inspection not a room inspection

1033
01:06:37.58 --> 01:06:41.18
And you know how they are over there. He's like not one I was like no

1034
01:06:41.18 --> 01:06:45.02
So you know I had attention detail from a my childhood

1035
01:06:45.74 --> 01:06:50.22
And be you know my time with the Marines like I had attention to detail and I could follow directions

1036
01:06:50.22 --> 01:06:54.86
I was like that was the one thing I could really do so they're like you know you haven't failed anything at all

1037
01:06:54.86 --> 01:06:57.58
They're like you know what we're gonna roll you one last time

1038
01:06:58.62 --> 01:07:02.22
And then you know last time I made it all the way through no issues so

1039
01:07:03.66 --> 01:07:05.66
And then where'd you end up going from there?

1040
01:07:05.66 --> 01:07:10.46
So you know you got jump school ask you tea

1041
01:07:11.74 --> 01:07:16.46
Alaska and then I was a corpsman so they sent me to

1042
01:07:17.34 --> 01:07:19.34
18 delta to

1043
01:07:19.34 --> 01:07:21.98
To go through the special operations medic course

1044
01:07:22.70 --> 01:07:27.34
Which is freaking long too. Yeah, it's a little over six months and if you go through the full course

1045
01:07:27.34 --> 01:07:28.54
It's like a year long

1046
01:07:28.70 --> 01:07:32.06
Did you go through the short course or the long course? Yeah, so I went through the short course

1047
01:07:32.06 --> 01:07:34.06
They asked me if I wanted to do the long course

1048
01:07:34.06 --> 01:07:36.38
And I said no I didn't want to do that

1049
01:07:37.50 --> 01:07:44.78
But before I headed out there you know I'd been dating the girl else telling about but and we actually ended up getting married before I went out there

1050
01:07:45.98 --> 01:07:50.22
And I did it because when I was going so I had just bought a house to

1051
01:07:50.86 --> 01:07:55.10
So I bought a house around that time in San Diego. We're not in San Diego isn't to make you look so many of you

1052
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:59.42
You know and I was like oh look at this big ass house like a biotic a for cheap

1053
01:07:59.90 --> 01:08:03.34
You know back then it was you know that there and I didn't realize like how long that drive was

1054
01:08:03.34 --> 01:08:05.34
So

1055
01:08:05.18 --> 01:08:11.26
So I got married because I'm like hey, I really need the San Diego BH because I spoke to the admin lady at Buds and she's like yeah

1056
01:08:11.26 --> 01:08:16.50
You have a house in your marion and you have your hair you're gonna get San Diego BH and not North Carolina BH

1057
01:08:16.50 --> 01:08:18.50
Which is like

1058
01:08:18.50 --> 01:08:22.72
It's penny compared to San Diego so once again. Why did you get married want that be a

1059
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I did love her. I'm sure there's other

1060
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:34.52
But yeah, so the reason I bring that up is because that was actually a sticking point when I was there

1061
01:08:34.52 --> 01:08:39.88
It was an issue because as I was going to the training I wasn't getting paid at all I was getting

1062
01:08:40.32 --> 01:08:42.48
Zero like you know money knows no behavior

1063
01:08:42.48 --> 01:08:49.32
Yeah, which is a big deal because now I got a mortgage and so I'm digging into my savings and I've been going you know, you know to the

1064
01:08:50.32 --> 01:08:53.36
To the cadre that were there. They have some seal cadre there's well

1065
01:08:53.36 --> 01:08:56.56
It's not like all army guys obviously they have the liaison's for friend of W

1066
01:08:56.56 --> 01:08:58.56
And

1067
01:08:58.56 --> 01:09:01.66
I you know I kept going up to them and tell them like yeah, I still haven't got paid

1068
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.76
Still haven't got paid and they're just like, oh don't worry about it and like it'll happen like they just I just feel like they weren't concerned about it at all

1069
01:09:09.32 --> 01:09:13.78
And for being honest I wasn't a fan of theirs like I could just just didn't get a good feeling from them and

1070
01:09:15.52 --> 01:09:21.68
I'm really digging into my savings and now I'm running out of money and I don't know if you know Captain Smithers is

1071
01:09:21.68 --> 01:09:27.56
So he was the CO at Buds when we were there and obviously like they knew who I was because

1072
01:09:27.84 --> 01:09:32.48
What happened so you know him and I had chatted every now and then and he actually came out and did some jumps with us

1073
01:09:32.48 --> 01:09:36.08
And at what point during one of the jumps like you was sitting next to me

1074
01:09:36.36 --> 01:09:39.52
He was like hey, you know just so you know if you ever need anything reach out

1075
01:09:41.40 --> 01:09:43.40
You see where this is going

1076
01:09:43.40 --> 01:09:53.20
So I call Buds quarter deck and I'm like, you know Buds quarter deck and I'm like you can please transfer me to catch some others off of that

1077
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:55.78
So I told him the story I'm like hey, I haven't got paid like these guys have totally blown me off

1078
01:09:55.78 --> 01:09:58.20
They haven't been helpful at all blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's pissed

1079
01:09:58.20 --> 01:10:05.12
He's like check so he has commander Zinky call me and commander Zinky calls me and then he's like that's that's unsat

1080
01:10:05.56 --> 01:10:09.56
That you've gone that long without getting paid so he calls over to the school

1081
01:10:09.56 --> 01:10:15.56
I get paid like two weeks later, but I get brought in and just shoot out by this senior chief and chief that are over there

1082
01:10:15.56 --> 01:10:19.12
And they're like you know, do you not understand how the chain of command works?

1083
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:21.88
blah, I mean they were furious and they're like you know

1084
01:10:21.88 --> 01:10:26.28
We're gonna take you to a trident review board. We're gonna drive you down to Virginia Beach

1085
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.28
And have a trident review board. I'm like these guys serious

1086
01:10:31.64 --> 01:10:36.80
So I go back home and I start calling like my recomb ladies. I'm like hey, is it cool if I come back?

1087
01:10:36.80 --> 01:10:42.32
I think they're gonna pull my trident and then they're like dude heck yeah, if you if you get dropped come on back

1088
01:10:43.64 --> 01:10:46.000
So you know I go in there and then

1089
01:10:46.72 --> 01:10:48.72
During one of the

1090
01:10:48.72 --> 01:10:53.20
The ass chewings that I'm getting I'm like you know what I'm like if you guys really take me to a trident review board

1091
01:10:53.20 --> 01:10:54.70
This is like what would you know?

1092
01:10:54.70 --> 01:11:00.44
We're consumed your cold camps. Me there's no like we're friends now again if you take me to try and review board I'll call them again

1093
01:11:01.44 --> 01:11:04.48
And they were like now they're like lost their mind

1094
01:11:04.48 --> 01:11:08.64
And then they're like you'll be hearing from us when it's time for your trident review board

1095
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:14.68
And I just never heard from them. They left it alone and I got paid like two weeks later

1096
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:17.76
They

1097
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:22.12
Anything else from 18 delta?

1098
01:11:22.76 --> 01:11:28.06
Well, I was where I met Neil. I met Johnny Kim. Oh right on that little genius

1099
01:11:28.72 --> 01:11:30.52
Yeah, so he was in the class behind me

1100
01:11:30.52 --> 01:11:36.72
I met Johnny Kim. I was also roommates with a with the dober all right on he was my roommate

1101
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:40.24
And Delta so it's pretty cool going through with him

1102
01:11:41.88 --> 01:11:46.62
Yeah, and then you those guys ended up coming to team three and you ended up coming to go in a team one

1103
01:11:46.62 --> 01:11:51.22
Yeah, so I actually was initially supposed to go to team three and

1104
01:11:51.72 --> 01:11:56.82
Then the corn in that went to team one for I for whatever reason he couldn't get a security clearance

1105
01:11:56.82 --> 01:12:02.90
So they're like hey, you're gonna go to team one now who's already started their work up and then you know

1106
01:12:02.90 --> 01:12:05.54
Dober was the first one to get orders to team three

1107
01:12:07.38 --> 01:12:10.22
So yeah, that's how I showed up team one. I think

1108
01:12:11.58 --> 01:12:14.02
2005 are you just fully amped to be

1109
01:12:14.58 --> 01:12:17.34
Yeah, just like beyond and the war's going on

1110
01:12:17.98 --> 01:12:19.98
On deployment

1111
01:12:19.98 --> 01:12:24.42
Yeah, you get thrown right into a platoon. Yeah, so I get thrown into the platoon

1112
01:12:24.42 --> 01:12:28.10
We start they've they've already started their work up

1113
01:12:29.22 --> 01:12:35.06
And it was everything that I was gonna be it was awesome the best job ever

1114
01:12:35.06 --> 01:12:38.34
I mean it really was I mean we would go to you know

1115
01:12:38.94 --> 01:12:44.14
Mississippi for training and do seek you see and then we would go to Kentucky for South and then we

1116
01:12:44.66 --> 01:12:48.10
You know around that time the PSD mission was gone so here we got to driving schools

1117
01:12:48.42 --> 01:12:51.46
So we would go to driving schools and it was just awesome like I

1118
01:12:51.46 --> 01:12:58.78
Loved being around the guys like it was it was everything I thought it would be it was it was pretty cool

1119
01:12:59.78 --> 01:13:02.98
We had some it's a mission in the platoon though

1120
01:13:04.78 --> 01:13:06.78
We went through three different chiefs

1121
01:13:07.06 --> 01:13:15.22
Dang yeah, so the leadership was a little bit of a dang of a problem and then I think the last chiefs that they brought in there

1122
01:13:15.22 --> 01:13:20.94
Like I don't think he was really into it. He was just like yeah, I'll do it, you know, oh

1123
01:13:21.78 --> 01:13:26.10
The crazy thing one of the crazy things I learned to trade at when I was working at trade at was

1124
01:13:27.30 --> 01:13:30.54
Look you're gonna you're gonna have some weak chiefs you're gonna have some weak officers

1125
01:13:30.54 --> 01:13:37.38
But if you have some good dudes in there, yeah, you'll just overcome all that you just overcome all of it and you'll fit you guys are the guys are gonna figure out

1126
01:13:39.46 --> 01:13:41.46
Often times the seal teams succeeds

1127
01:13:41.46 --> 01:13:48.50
Becuse of the lower because because of the leadership from somewhere in the platoon doesn't have to come from the OIC

1128
01:13:48.50 --> 01:13:51.46
It doesn't have to come from the chief now those guys can be bad enough that they actually

1129
01:13:52.10 --> 01:13:56.58
squash the junior leadership and that's when you have a platoon that just falls apart completely

1130
01:13:56.94 --> 01:14:04.58
But if the you know, I've seen OICs that were just completely getting carried by some two e-fives in the platoon

1131
01:14:04.58 --> 01:14:07.94
The OIC and the chief getting carried by two or three good e-fives

1132
01:14:07.94 --> 01:14:09.94
I've seen that all day long. I'm sure you did too

1133
01:14:09.94 --> 01:14:14.66
Yeah, but occasionally you'll get a chief for a OIC that

1134
01:14:15.14 --> 01:14:17.14
Look when they're great. That's great. We're all good

1135
01:14:17.22 --> 01:14:22.84
But it's occasionally they'll squash the junior leadership because their ego gets involved and then I want the you know

1136
01:14:22.84 --> 01:14:26.34
Someone else making calls and it just turns into a total disaster

1137
01:14:27.62 --> 01:14:29.62
The OIC wasn't very well acting

1138
01:14:32.42 --> 01:14:37.70
So you guys are getting do you guys know where you're going on the plymet? No because we're competing for four

1139
01:14:37.70 --> 01:14:40.58
We're going at the time and you know

1140
01:14:41.30 --> 01:14:45.22
I guess that unfortunately the leadership didn't build good relationships up the chain of command

1141
01:14:45.22 --> 01:14:52.98
So even though the platoon was awesome like we had some really talented people in that platoon really talented people in that platoon and

1142
01:14:54.98 --> 01:14:59.86
You know it is what it is that it just did build really we were not the favorite platoon and

1143
01:15:00.66 --> 01:15:04.18
It was around that time when there you know the OIC came up to me. It's like hey, you know

1144
01:15:04.18 --> 01:15:09.06
We're short snipers do you know you were a Marine you're gonna land that Bob odd you want to go

1145
01:15:09.46 --> 01:15:12.74
Do you want to go to sniper school and I said yeah

1146
01:15:14.82 --> 01:15:22.62
He's like two caveats he's like one it's Army sniper school and two you got to go to UAV school afterwards and I'm like yeah

1147
01:15:22.62 --> 01:15:28.22
Yeah, fine whatever just send me yeah, it's so weird how your mentality could be so

1148
01:15:28.22 --> 01:15:34.38
Unaligned with other people they're giving you these quote caveats. Yeah, bro when when we ended up going to Ramadi

1149
01:15:34.38 --> 01:15:37.58
We were supposed to go to Baghdad and task into bruiser and my

1150
01:15:38.46 --> 01:15:44.18
Commanding officer calls me in and he's like he's presenting this thing to me like it's the worst deal ever

1151
01:15:44.18 --> 01:15:50.46
And I'm like so happy. I'm trying I'm just poker face, you know like hey Roger that scrum should we can make some adjustments

1152
01:15:50.46 --> 01:15:53.50
And then I was like oh I can negotiate and I said well we're gonna need this

1153
01:15:53.50 --> 01:15:58.94
I'm gonna need some more people and some more like support and he was like yeah, we can take care of that totally hooked me up, bro

1154
01:15:58.94 --> 01:16:02.30
But I was like oh, are you serious you can send us to Ramadi instead?

1155
01:16:02.98 --> 01:16:06.90
Let's do this yeah, he was thrown caveat at me. I'm like yep

1156
01:16:06.90 --> 01:16:10.54
No, I'm really sorry. We're gonna send you to you. We're gonna send you to you. I'm like

1157
01:16:11.10 --> 01:16:12.82
Okay, you know I'm trying to hold my side

1158
01:16:12.82 --> 01:16:17.66
Yeah, yeah, let's do it. So yeah, so I ended up going to army sniper school and that was

1159
01:16:18.14 --> 01:16:21.34
That was cool going to army school and you know

1160
01:16:21.34 --> 01:16:25.22
It's pretty funny dealing with the army guy. So I had one point so they sent another guy with me

1161
01:16:25.22 --> 01:16:30.54
So they sent two of us to sniper school and we go out to a bar one night and we see some of the guys from our class

1162
01:16:30.54 --> 01:16:35.02
And at that you know at that point they were kind of standoffish because we were being quiet too

1163
01:16:35.02 --> 01:16:41.66
You know, we didn't really talk to people. They see us at the bar and they're like hey you guys are you guys are the seals in our class, right?

1164
01:16:41.66 --> 01:16:45.10
And we're like yeah, you guys is my wife by your shot

1165
01:16:45.58 --> 01:16:46.94
I was like yeah, let's do it

1166
01:16:46.94 --> 01:16:49.90
So I'm like cool. So they buy us a shot and I

1167
01:16:49.90 --> 01:16:55.98
Take this shot and it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted in my life like I want to throw up

1168
01:16:56.86 --> 01:17:00.62
And it's it's funny because I so I take the shot and they're like looking at us

1169
01:17:01.42 --> 01:17:05.26
And I want thanks guys even though inside I'm like what the hell was this?

1170
01:17:05.26 --> 01:17:08.62
So I said it down on my thanks fellas and they're like looking at like

1171
01:17:09.10 --> 01:17:11.10
Dang that's why they're maybe

1172
01:17:12.22 --> 01:17:17.42
So I guess they gave us like some gag shot that's both to like make you throw up

1173
01:17:17.42 --> 01:17:24.14
Yeah, and both of us were just like normal face all the time. Yeah, no expression like thanks fellas, but inside I'm like what

1174
01:17:26.62 --> 01:17:28.62
It was disgusting and then here just like

1175
01:17:29.18 --> 01:17:32.62
Dang that's why the baby's you just you see that they didn't even flinch

1176
01:17:33.10 --> 01:17:35.74
Anyway flinch and then

1177
01:17:36.78 --> 01:17:38.78
Yeah, and then we had another

1178
01:17:38.78 --> 01:17:40.78
We were back in

1179
01:17:40.78 --> 01:17:45.66
Back in and training and they were like oh you guys didn't load up in the truck fast enough for something like that

1180
01:17:45.66 --> 01:17:49.90
And they're like oh this one guy was like freaking out like guys if we don't do this fast enough we're gonna get beat

1181
01:17:50.30 --> 01:17:52.70
I'm like so what if we get beat like

1182
01:17:52.94 --> 01:17:55.42
Okay, and one of the instructors heard me

1183
01:17:55.66 --> 01:17:59.10
But he didn't know who I was so he was just like oh we got we got a tough guy the group

1184
01:17:59.42 --> 01:18:02.14
He's like all right he's like come on out

1185
01:18:02.54 --> 01:18:05.90
So he's like push-ups, you know, I'm doing push-ups. I don't push-ups and then he's like

1186
01:18:06.38 --> 01:18:09.10
Okay, flutter kicks and by the way like I

1187
01:18:09.34 --> 01:18:13.98
Used to do so many flutter kicks that I got tired accounting and I would literally set my timer for 10 minutes straight

1188
01:18:13.98 --> 01:18:16.94
And we just do flutter kicks for 10 minutes straight because I didn't want a count anymore

1189
01:18:17.18 --> 01:18:22.38
So he's having me do these flutter kicks and I could tell one of the other instructors like giggling behind it

1190
01:18:22.54 --> 01:18:24.54
Because the guy doesn't know why I mean like oh

1191
01:18:25.18 --> 01:18:29.10
Kind of good at these and then the instructor's like bro, you know, he's a seal right?

1192
01:18:29.10 --> 01:18:30.38
He's like

1193
01:18:30.38 --> 01:18:35.10
Dude, why didn't you tell me I'm over here like an idiot trying to break this guy. He's not gonna break

1194
01:18:35.66 --> 01:18:37.66
And then afterwards like he's like you want you want a dip

1195
01:18:38.94 --> 01:18:40.86
I'm just like no, I don't dip, but thank you

1196
01:18:40.86 --> 01:18:46.62
Yeah, so you end up going on a point and you go to go to a visit yeah pay calm to point

1197
01:18:47.50 --> 01:18:49.26
That's where you guys went right yeah, so

1198
01:18:50.30 --> 01:18:54.06
The majority of the platoon got sent to go on and then they were like hey if you're a

1199
01:18:54.30 --> 01:18:59.58
Uav pilot a sniper or a corpsman you're gonna go to the PI and I was all three three for three three for three

1200
01:18:59.58 --> 01:19:02.78
So that deployment was kind of weird for me because I wasn't with

1201
01:19:03.58 --> 01:19:07.98
My platoon for the majority of time like I was literally getting formed out to whoever needed me

1202
01:19:07.98 --> 01:19:14.22
So I went to Tau-Tau-A, Holy Oze and belong to those times where I got attached to like an ODA unit

1203
01:19:14.62 --> 01:19:16.62
Because they didn't have their 18 delta with them and

1204
01:19:17.26 --> 01:19:23.42
You know, I got attached to them and and there was a point there on the deployment where I got

1205
01:19:25.10 --> 01:19:26.62
I got sent home a ship

1206
01:19:26.62 --> 01:19:30.72
You know because that's how that I was getting transported for one place to another and at the time I had another

1207
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:36.46
Oh, I see the way you said that you're like I got sent on a ship. Yeah. Well, that was like the one thing that I dreaded

1208
01:19:36.46 --> 01:19:42.62
You know as going on a ship. So this was like my first ship experience and I'm there with my my jail who

1209
01:19:43.26 --> 01:19:46.06
As a prior force recon gunny

1210
01:19:46.62 --> 01:19:51.10
You probably know who he is very tall dude. Yeah, it looks mean. Just tatted up

1211
01:19:51.98 --> 01:19:56.14
And so we're on this ship together and we we go to Chau and

1212
01:19:56.70 --> 01:20:00.70
I was like hey, sir, you know, this is where you and I part ways I got to go eat with the enlisted

1213
01:20:00.70 --> 01:20:04.38
You got to go to officers. He's like I'm not eating by myself. He's like you're coming with me

1214
01:20:04.38 --> 01:20:10.54
And we're wearing sterile camis so no name tapes no rank nothing so we go into the Chauhall with the officers and

1215
01:20:11.82 --> 01:20:16.46
So I'm sitting there and and you can tell like there's this this surface war for officer

1216
01:20:16.46 --> 01:20:22.46
He's looking at us because he sees he's might my jail. I mean he's tatted up. Yeah, no, we both don't look like officers

1217
01:20:24.86 --> 01:20:28.46
So he's he's looking at some finally gets he gets the courage come sit next

1218
01:20:28.46 --> 01:20:33.82
He's like so uh who are you guys and then he's like oh I'm lieutenant so and so and this is Lieutenant Mendez

1219
01:20:33.82 --> 01:20:37.90
I was like oh dang. I just got promoted for five to Lieutenant

1220
01:20:38.70 --> 01:20:42.94
So for like the rest of the deployment or sorry the the rest of the time on the ship

1221
01:20:42.94 --> 01:20:45.66
He's like calling me sir and whatnot and at one point

1222
01:20:46.30 --> 01:20:50.22
You know I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle because we're doing like some sniper stuff

1223
01:20:50.94 --> 01:20:55.10
I'm getting off the heel with my sniper rifle and the CEO knows who we are we're on his ship

1224
01:20:55.34 --> 01:20:58.94
And he was standing XCO and the CEO's like hey, HM2, do you might have all that?

1225
01:20:58.94 --> 01:21:04.46
Can you mind if I check out your your sniper rifle and you just see this guy's look he's just

1226
01:21:05.26 --> 01:21:09.34
She's steaming inside that he'd been calling me sir for like two weeks

1227
01:21:10.46 --> 01:21:12.70
He's like turns out I'm an HM2

1228
01:21:12.70 --> 01:21:14.70
HM2 man

1229
01:21:14.70 --> 01:21:19.02
Spot promoted that's like Andy Stomp spot promotes himself to whatever rank is required

1230
01:21:22.78 --> 01:21:27.26
And then you come back from that just roll into another petoon. Yeah, and how's that one girl?

1231
01:21:27.26 --> 01:21:29.26
It was awesome

1232
01:21:29.98 --> 01:21:34.30
I had a new OIC new chief new LPO

1233
01:21:35.90 --> 01:21:37.90
And

1234
01:21:37.90 --> 01:21:43.90
This OIC was was pretty awesome. He I remember when he first got there he set a meeting with me

1235
01:21:44.46 --> 01:21:47.66
And I'm thinking oh man, I'm in trouble like what's you know because up to that point

1236
01:21:47.66 --> 01:21:51.02
I had very little interaction with my I OIC very minimal

1237
01:21:51.02 --> 01:21:57.10
And I'm thinking dude I'm in trouble so I go in there and it kind of shocked me that he asked me like hey

1238
01:21:57.10 --> 01:22:00.46
So what you know what your family situation like like how are you doing?

1239
01:22:00.78 --> 01:22:02.14
Is there anything you need?

1240
01:22:02.14 --> 01:22:04.14
Where do you want to go with your career?

1241
01:22:04.14 --> 01:22:06.54
I was like the first time anybody had really asked me

1242
01:22:06.94 --> 01:22:09.58
I was like I don't know I'll just have him a great time being in a platoon

1243
01:22:10.62 --> 01:22:14.54
You know and he's like you know I noticed you don't have a college degree there's this program

1244
01:22:15.10 --> 01:22:18.62
Where you can get commission we send you away to school for three years and you come back as an officer

1245
01:22:18.62 --> 01:22:20.22
Is that something you'd be interested in?

1246
01:22:20.22 --> 01:22:24.38
I was like I'll actually you know I actually had never heard of that but yeah, it's interesting

1247
01:22:24.38 --> 01:22:29.98
I'll keep it in mind and you know I always say that this guy built a better relationship in the first two weeks with us

1248
01:22:30.30 --> 01:22:33.10
Then the prior OIC had built like in two years

1249
01:22:34.46 --> 01:22:38.70
So it's pretty cool he we tactically speaking he probably wasn't the best

1250
01:22:40.78 --> 01:22:46.78
But strategically he was he was great because he knew who his subject matter expert were he was a very humble guy

1251
01:22:46.78 --> 01:22:55.34
Leaned on them a lot and you know the same group was was together again and it was an awesome awesome workup

1252
01:22:55.58 --> 01:23:00.62
For me like I had a even better time in the first time because I'll be honest like I was I was disappointed the first time around

1253
01:23:00.94 --> 01:23:06.62
With leadership because I had been exposed to really good leadership with the Marines right I mean they were like

1254
01:23:07.26 --> 01:23:10.38
Just absolute professionals and then when I got to that first

1255
01:23:11.82 --> 01:23:14.38
Platoon you know it's a little disappointed so I'm like okay cool

1256
01:23:14.38 --> 01:23:17.82
So that's when I started realizing like okay leadership is you know

1257
01:23:18.14 --> 01:23:21.74
Ebson flows sometimes you get good ones sometimes you get bad ones and anything in between

1258
01:23:22.30 --> 01:23:26.54
The Velcro just like anything else when you go through was that when I was running trade it when you're going through that workup

1259
01:23:26.54 --> 01:23:33.74
I don't think you are there. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think you were there yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know one thing I've always said is the

1260
01:23:34.86 --> 01:23:40.54
The Marines have like a tighter shot group or like a tighter standard so

1261
01:23:40.54 --> 01:23:46.86
Like if you have like the best you know the best seal between they're going to be freaking off the charts awesome

1262
01:23:46.86 --> 01:23:51.10
Yeah, and but the worst seal puttune is going to be off the charts shitty

1263
01:23:51.90 --> 01:23:56.78
And the Marine Corps has like a tighter more standardized group of like hey, this is what this is where they're going to be

1264
01:23:56.78 --> 01:23:57.98
They're going to fit in their better

1265
01:23:57.98 --> 01:24:01.02
Which is nice because you don't end up with those low points of leadership

1266
01:24:02.46 --> 01:24:04.46
And then we're doing up going on

1267
01:24:05.02 --> 01:24:07.02
On deployment so

1268
01:24:07.02 --> 01:24:09.90
Um, so before deployment actually they sent me to

1269
01:24:10.46 --> 01:24:15.42
To Central America for a while because they had they had us, you know a mission going down down there adjacent

1270
01:24:15.82 --> 01:24:18.38
Type mission they're like hey, does anybody speak fluent Spanish?

1271
01:24:19.02 --> 01:24:23.26
I was like I speak fluent Spanish so they sent me down there and so I was there for

1272
01:24:24.14 --> 01:24:25.34
For a while

1273
01:24:25.34 --> 01:24:30.86
I'll say it was long because they switched other people out like so they were there's like other guys would be go there for two weeks

1274
01:24:30.86 --> 01:24:35.58
or so, but I was there the entire time just because I was teaching all the classes and going out with them and stuff

1275
01:24:35.58 --> 01:24:37.58
So I did that first and then

1276
01:24:38.70 --> 01:24:40.70
We ended up getting

1277
01:24:40.70 --> 01:24:41.74
Remoddy

1278
01:24:41.74 --> 01:24:46.78
So like okay cool we're going back to we're going to Remoddy for a deployment and so I'm like finally

1279
01:24:47.66 --> 01:24:50.70
This is it and when did you show up there?

1280
01:24:51.90 --> 01:24:53.90
October

1281
01:24:54.78 --> 01:24:56.78
Let's see my son was born

1282
01:24:56.78 --> 01:24:57.98
July

1283
01:24:57.98 --> 01:25:03.26
So yeah September october timeframe okay, so I was home for like a couple months after my son was born

1284
01:25:03.26 --> 01:25:09.10
But it hit me a little doubt a lot by that time oh yeah a lot a lot yeah, yeah, yeah, so what was the deployment like

1285
01:25:10.14 --> 01:25:13.42
So it started off fantastic like when we got there

1286
01:25:14.78 --> 01:25:17.90
We hadn't been in country that long and I remember we got our first mission and

1287
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:20.62
And

1288
01:25:20.62 --> 01:25:24.62
It was pretty cool because they're like hey, it's it's a little bit outside of Remoddy so we guys are going to take helo's there

1289
01:25:25.58 --> 01:25:30.14
So I'm the point man, you know I'm planning out the routes and stuff and I remember getting in the helo and

1290
01:25:30.14 --> 01:25:35.66
And looking around being like whoa, this is legit. Well, this is finally here like I've got my you know

1291
01:25:35.66 --> 01:25:38.94
I look around everybody's got their their nods on. We've got their weapons wearing the helo

1292
01:25:40.22 --> 01:25:43.50
And you know, it was a DA mission like

1293
01:25:44.46 --> 01:25:50.86
It's basically everything that you want to do and so you know we get dropped off a few clicks away

1294
01:25:51.26 --> 01:25:53.26
Patrol into the target and

1295
01:25:54.46 --> 01:25:58.06
I see some guards out there with with AKs and and it's the first time like

1296
01:25:58.06 --> 01:26:03.34
Like like literally first mission and I get to shoot someone right off the back. No, like this is awesome

1297
01:26:05.34 --> 01:26:09.10
So I'm thinking that that's the way things are you know because I go back to the base and I'm like

1298
01:26:09.10 --> 01:26:10.70
I got you know, I got to reload my mags

1299
01:26:11.74 --> 01:26:16.78
So I'm thinking this is going to be like a normal thing. I better go get some more ammo because you know if it's going to be like this all the

1300
01:26:16.78 --> 01:26:18.78
Plymouth and

1301
01:26:19.02 --> 01:26:21.42
And then we actually don't do anything for like a month

1302
01:26:21.98 --> 01:26:23.98
I'm just like a

1303
01:26:23.98 --> 01:26:25.98
We suck again

1304
01:26:25.98 --> 01:26:30.06
But then they're like hey listen there's there's work to be done but if you want to do it you got to go to the outskirts

1305
01:26:31.34 --> 01:26:36.70
So we actually ended up packing all our homies and going out to Tharthar and then from from there

1306
01:26:36.70 --> 01:26:40.70
We were at some small base and we're like living out of our homies, but but we were working

1307
01:26:40.86 --> 01:26:42.86
Which is what team guys want to do so it was true

1308
01:26:43.34 --> 01:26:46.62
I thought it was as great a plymet you know when I hear you talk about your your first one

1309
01:26:47.50 --> 01:26:51.34
That's kind of how I see this one you're doing DAs all the time. You know no one really got hurt

1310
01:26:51.74 --> 01:26:53.90
You know it was great so

1311
01:26:53.90 --> 01:26:55.90
And you get some good

1312
01:26:56.14 --> 01:26:58.78
Experts good to do those reps, man. Oh yeah, like you just

1313
01:26:59.58 --> 01:27:05.50
The whole cycle from the planning to the to the transit to the execution things aren't going quite right

1314
01:27:05.50 --> 01:27:12.70
But you get them sorted out like you just get good reps, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yep, and as a point man like it was it was a really good experience for me

1315
01:27:13.26 --> 01:27:15.26
As funny cuz like around that time

1316
01:27:16.06 --> 01:27:17.02
You know

1317
01:27:17.02 --> 01:27:21.50
My my OIC at one point we something changed in the plan and then he's like hey

1318
01:27:21.50 --> 01:27:27.98
We need to switch course or whatever. I'm like check. I was like let me get in my poncho and my red red lens

1319
01:27:28.62 --> 01:27:31.50
He's like what are you doing? Oh, like I need to look at my map

1320
01:27:31.90 --> 01:27:36.78
He's like how have you been navigating this whole time? I was like map and compass because in the Marines

1321
01:27:36.78 --> 01:27:37.98
That's how we did it

1322
01:27:38.22 --> 01:27:40.62
He's like you don't have a GPS and I'm like no

1323
01:27:41.18 --> 01:27:43.18
He's like if you're gonna be my point man

1324
01:27:43.58 --> 01:27:45.58
You need to know how to use a GPS

1325
01:27:46.30 --> 01:27:50.54
Because I'm like you know under my poncho my red lens like looking at my map and trying to figure it all out and then

1326
01:27:50.54 --> 01:27:52.54
And so I go back to camp and I'm

1327
01:27:53.26 --> 01:27:59.98
I bust out my GPS. It's still in the wrapper. Damn. It's still in the wrapper. So I'm reading the directions and when I

1328
01:28:01.74 --> 01:28:03.74
I'm reading the directions to this thing and

1329
01:28:04.62 --> 01:28:07.90
Then I'm like where is this thing been my whole life? Yeah

1330
01:28:08.78 --> 01:28:10.78
This is awesome

1331
01:28:10.78 --> 01:28:16.62
Damn that's crazy that was in 2007. Yeah, yeah, I don't know what's happening about the compass yeah

1332
01:28:16.62 --> 01:28:23.98
Because that's the way I had always done it in the Marines. We did eight on a land map and that's actually how I became the point man because one of the more experienced guys was like

1333
01:28:24.38 --> 01:28:26.38
Hey, bro, I don't know how to land have

1334
01:28:26.38 --> 01:28:29.50
He's like you know I land and this was like my first first up

1335
01:28:30.06 --> 01:28:31.02
Button

1336
01:28:31.02 --> 01:28:33.98
He's like hey, you're really good at land. That right you see with the Marines. Oh my god, pretty good

1337
01:28:33.98 --> 01:28:35.98
He's like won't be the point man. I was like heck yeah

1338
01:28:36.30 --> 01:28:40.62
So I'd be came point man, but no one knew that I was just going off my campus my compass and mountain

1339
01:28:40.62 --> 01:28:47.42
And they'll then and then when I discovered that GPS man game changer yeah, especially by that time because by that time in 2007

1340
01:28:47.42 --> 01:28:50.06
It was like one of the you'd have when you're wrist yeah

1341
01:28:50.06 --> 01:28:52.38
When you're wrist so that's what I had I had the little Garmin one

1342
01:28:52.38 --> 01:28:55.58
I mean it even goes on your wrist. I'm like this is amazing freaking ridiculous

1343
01:28:55.58 --> 01:28:58.46
And then I started carrying two of them around like one in here and one of my pocket

1344
01:28:58.46 --> 01:28:59.74
Just in case that one protect now

1345
01:28:59.74 --> 01:29:04.70
I really liked it so I'm like I don't want this thing breaking down on hey what up that story with the S vest

1346
01:29:06.06 --> 01:29:09.18
So there's a couple actually so the one

1347
01:29:09.18 --> 01:29:14.70
Um, then you know, we always talk about the complacency we had there was like a drone

1348
01:29:15.50 --> 01:29:17.50
That had

1349
01:29:17.50 --> 01:29:21.66
Watch some guys like planning some IDs in the road and then followed them back to their house and

1350
01:29:22.22 --> 01:29:27.26
They're like hey guys are gonna go hit this house like cool so our opportunity was tasked with hitting that house

1351
01:29:28.06 --> 01:29:30.86
And when our you know my pretend gets there they're like oh

1352
01:29:31.42 --> 01:29:33.34
It was kind of odd because there's just like an old man

1353
01:29:33.34 --> 01:29:38.78
Some women and children like it's kind of odd and you know as we're on target or whatever

1354
01:29:39.82 --> 01:29:41.98
We start finding some like propaganda

1355
01:29:42.14 --> 01:29:45.50
We start finding like some small stuff but nothing huge

1356
01:29:46.54 --> 01:29:48.78
And we'd been on target for I'm gonna say

1357
01:29:49.42 --> 01:29:51.42
At least like three four hours

1358
01:29:51.74 --> 01:29:55.34
So we were there for a while like we got pictures and guys like sitting on a couch and

1359
01:29:55.90 --> 01:29:58.54
And by the way, it's like a painful story to tell afterwards because you know

1360
01:29:58.54 --> 01:30:03.42
And you like to think that your professionals and it's definitely a slap in the face like whoa

1361
01:30:03.42 --> 01:30:07.98
It's really not over because it's leading up this like how many opposite you run at this point

1362
01:30:07.98 --> 01:30:12.38
We'd been there for a while so you so you were kind of we were in a good rhythm you were getting the reps

1363
01:30:12.38 --> 01:30:16.14
But the reps start becoming routine. Yep, and we were in the outskirts too. So like

1364
01:30:16.78 --> 01:30:24.06
This this house was out in the middle of nowhere. It's not like in Ramadi where it's like a very dynamic environment where everybody starts coming out and they know you're there

1365
01:30:24.94 --> 01:30:25.94
Um

1366
01:30:25.94 --> 01:30:31.22
So anyways, so we're doing SSC in one of our guys. So wait, so you hit this target. It's in the middle of vehicles

1367
01:30:31.38 --> 01:30:36.30
Yeah, yeah, so you drive vehicles up you hit the target now you've done this a bunch of times

1368
01:30:36.50 --> 01:30:38.50
You get the target cleared

1369
01:30:38.50 --> 01:30:46.54
No contact when you hit the target the people that you find on target is sort of the typical sort of people that you're gonna find

1370
01:30:46.82 --> 01:30:49.30
Old man couple women some kids

1371
01:30:49.74 --> 01:30:53.62
The house is looks like all the other houses look like so

1372
01:30:53.62 --> 01:30:59.42
In your mind you're probably thinking this is probably probably probably nothing here. Yeah, absolutely

1373
01:30:59.42 --> 01:31:02.90
And we had to add targets like that as well and you're there for three hours doing SSC

1374
01:31:02.90 --> 01:31:07.42
Yeah, because we started finding stuff so like guys actually had their helmet and they were like picks and shovels and stuff

1375
01:31:07.42 --> 01:31:10.10
Okay, like we're actually like breaking down some walls

1376
01:31:10.10 --> 01:31:16.14
We found some false walls and stuff and okay, so suspects so as your search and you're like, oh, this is some propaganda

1377
01:31:16.14 --> 01:31:22.58
We need to go a little harder. Yeah, now we go a little bit harder. We find more stuff. Yep, and so but at the same time there's been no

1378
01:31:22.58 --> 01:31:23.58
No

1379
01:31:23.58 --> 01:31:30.90
No bad guys, no, so you're just really just doing an Intel recovery at this point. Yeah, yeah, which means you're guys kind of chill

1380
01:31:30.90 --> 01:31:32.90
No, very much

1381
01:31:32.90 --> 01:31:34.90
Countess yeah

1382
01:31:35.90 --> 01:31:42.06
I actually have a picture of that, but so anyway, so one of our guys goes into one of the rooms and lifts a rug up and there's this

1383
01:31:43.18 --> 01:31:48.62
There's something on the floor that that's a little different color than the rest and you could tell it's kind of like a door or something

1384
01:31:48.62 --> 01:31:54.76
So he calls the EOD guy. Oh, so hey come check this out. You know make sure it's not booby trapped and he's like, no, we're good

1385
01:31:54.76 --> 01:31:56.26
And I think we're good. Let's open enough

1386
01:31:56.38 --> 01:32:02.80
So we open it up and there's there's a bunch of dudes down there. I think it was like 13 to 15 dudes down there and the first couple have like suicide vessel

1387
01:32:04.18 --> 01:32:07.80
guy Chuck's a grenade up it hits our EOD guy in the chest

1388
01:32:08.30 --> 01:32:12.10
They dive like behind some furniture the the grenade went low order

1389
01:32:12.98 --> 01:32:14.34
so

1390
01:32:14.34 --> 01:32:20.38
You want to talk about someone looking out for you that it was old, you know, so it didn't blow up to its full potential and

1391
01:32:20.82 --> 01:32:29.06
The avalanche call came out because they saw the S vessel on the dude so avalanche everybody runs out of the house and as the last dude runs out

1392
01:32:29.86 --> 01:32:31.86
You know our hombees are already

1393
01:32:32.10 --> 01:32:38.98
Ready to go and as soon as the last dude last man out it was like 50 cows like boobo boobo and we don't know if like a 50 cow

1394
01:32:38.98 --> 01:32:43.66
Hit someone's vest or if the dude clocked himself off, but the house blew up

1395
01:32:43.66 --> 01:32:45.66
The house blew up and

1396
01:32:46.66 --> 01:32:52.02
Some of the guys were we're still alive. I guess that we're still under even that even after that explosion

1397
01:32:52.90 --> 01:32:57.88
So guys are coming up some guys left their helmets and nods inside the house

1398
01:32:58.54 --> 01:33:02.20
So some guys got no nons. I think a couple weapons were left in there as well

1399
01:33:04.30 --> 01:33:11.86
Yeah, as a matter of fact I'll tell you that some of the stuff we recovered afterwards, but anyways, so yeah, we're laying down fire and

1400
01:33:11.86 --> 01:33:17.82
And at one point a rocket is shot and it hits like five feet from our humby

1401
01:33:17.86 --> 01:33:21.14
So we're like hey, we need to back out and we need to drop air on this thing

1402
01:33:21.54 --> 01:33:26.26
So we'd back out we drop air on it and actually drop the couple bombs on it and then

1403
01:33:26.66 --> 01:33:31.50
You know afterwards when we go and recover stuff you could tell that these these guys that that were there they weren't

1404
01:33:32.14 --> 01:33:37.50
They were there were foreign fighters. They were different than some of the other guys that we had come across

1405
01:33:37.50 --> 01:33:42.14
But we recovered some of the nods that we left in there. We recovered

1406
01:33:42.86 --> 01:33:50.42
One of the weapons that we had left in there and it's crazy because I guess one of them must have picked the weapon up like our

1407
01:33:50.42 --> 01:33:57.54
Rm4 and started shooting with that m4 and when we picked up that m4 at the front of the barrel

1408
01:33:57.54 --> 01:34:01.72
You can tell that the 50 cow round had gone through the front of the barrel

1409
01:34:01.72 --> 01:34:06.54
Pay you out the back blew this guys head off and then we found this guys head like 50 yards down

1410
01:34:06.54 --> 01:34:12.76
Down the road, but I was crazy. So I mean, you know, we have a picture of the gun like with a 50 cow

1411
01:34:13.42 --> 01:34:17.46
So doing that report on all the lost stuff

1412
01:34:18.26 --> 01:34:25.46
That's things were you the LPO of this put to oh no no, I'll just say just the door kicker. Yeah. Oh, that's right

1413
01:34:25.46 --> 01:34:28.06
You said you were the point man. Yeah, I love being a point man

1414
01:34:30.30 --> 01:34:34.84
So that gets your that that snaps you back into reality. Yep. Yep

1415
01:34:34.84 --> 01:34:36.84
So

1416
01:34:37.40 --> 01:34:38.68
Yeah

1417
01:34:38.68 --> 01:34:41.54
It's completely you said there was a couple S best stories

1418
01:34:42.36 --> 01:34:45.08
Yeah, so the other one was I guess they were

1419
01:34:45.92 --> 01:34:50.64
They were smuggling some S best in I forget from where it was you know when you're young

1420
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:56.70
You don't pay attention to some of the details that are passed on but they were they were importing some S best

1421
01:34:57.32 --> 01:35:04.48
And at one point that the Iraqi police pulled this guy over who they thought could be one of those guys that was smuggling S best

1422
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:09.66
So we take the vehicle and we we rip it apart completely and behind the glow compartment

1423
01:35:09.66 --> 01:35:14.72
We find an S best and so our UD guys take it out and then they're like hey

1424
01:35:15.44 --> 01:35:20.64
Let's make it a nerd and let's put it back and let's see where he goes and then we'll catch him and his friend

1425
01:35:21.36 --> 01:35:25.84
So they do that they make you know, they they make the the best and we put it back

1426
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:30.40
We give the car back to the Iraqi police at that point. You don't know who's you know who's who?

1427
01:35:30.40 --> 01:35:34.48
They're all corrupt, you know, there's people that had infiltrated

1428
01:35:35.04 --> 01:35:39.52
All forms of government police so we didn't tell him what we found or just like hey, we're good

1429
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:43.32
So they're like okay cool. So they let the guy go and of course he goes back to his house

1430
01:35:43.32 --> 01:35:48.60
And at this point now we're being mandated to bring you know the Iraqis with us because for a while

1431
01:35:48.60 --> 01:35:50.84
There are from where I could remember we were by ourselves

1432
01:35:51.32 --> 01:35:56.16
Like just us but this point like okay, so anyway, so we end up hitting this house and

1433
01:35:56.16 --> 01:36:01.04
Well boy has his best on and he's like trying to clock himself off all but it's inert

1434
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:05.44
That's all and he had actually two switches like he had a primary in a secondary

1435
01:36:05.44 --> 01:36:09.56
So you know he's yelling out you know like boy and he's like click and he's like oh crap and he's a click

1436
01:36:09.56 --> 01:36:11.56
Trying to do the other one and

1437
01:36:11.56 --> 01:36:13.56
How's that working out for you homey?

1438
01:36:13.56 --> 01:36:15.56
He's got no head

1439
01:36:16.20 --> 01:36:20.000
It's stuff man and no one got hurt on that freaking though where the

1440
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:23.20
Spider-Hole was huh? No damn

1441
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:27.40
It's like I said that's about it's good to play as you could do a lot of work and no one got hurt

1442
01:36:29.20 --> 01:36:31.60
You get done with that and then is that when you come to trade it?

1443
01:36:32.20 --> 01:36:37.84
Yeah, so I come back and they're like hey, you're gonna have to go trade it and I'm like I don't want to go to trade it

1444
01:36:37.84 --> 01:36:41.84
You know are you and he's six now? I'm in he's six. Yeah. Yeah, yeah

1445
01:36:41.84 --> 01:36:43.84
I just made he's six on that and women actually

1446
01:36:44.56 --> 01:36:46.32
so

1447
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:50.12
You know I come back home. I'm I'm having some personal issues

1448
01:36:50.12 --> 01:36:54.12
You know with with my wife at the time and

1449
01:36:55.60 --> 01:37:00.54
You know and instead of trying to work things out and be a good husband

1450
01:37:00.88 --> 01:37:06.50
Which you know I look back on I could have done a much much better job of you know

1451
01:37:06.50 --> 01:37:11.28
I look back at that marriage. I'm like hey, you know that's 100% my fault. I wasn't a very empathetic person

1452
01:37:13.08 --> 01:37:16.16
Marriage is tough thing and it's even tougher when you're young and you know

1453
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:21.08
It's even tougher when you married a team guy who's gone all the time and I didn't think about that

1454
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:24.000
You know, I'm just like you know she moved right from a parent house to me

1455
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.40
And I'm just like I don't understand what you're complaining about

1456
01:37:26.68 --> 01:37:30.76
Anyways, there's a lot of tension between her and she served me divorce papers and

1457
01:37:32.72 --> 01:37:36.72
Instead of you know trying to take a knee and work things out. What do I do?

1458
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:41.84
They're like hey, oh there's corn and needed for this. I've got a stand-to-plyment and I'm like I'll go

1459
01:37:41.84 --> 01:37:48.24
So I end up volunteering for for a very short augment

1460
01:37:49.24 --> 01:37:52.56
Before I go to trade it and then you would add him want to go to trade it so they were like hey

1461
01:37:52.56 --> 01:37:57.04
You've got some time here a team one before you check into trade it cool that was kind of like

1462
01:37:57.76 --> 01:38:05.56
You know my give me so there I cool go do that and so I come back from that deployment and then that's when I I check in the trade it and

1463
01:38:06.48 --> 01:38:08.48
That's why I meet JP Denil

1464
01:38:08.48 --> 01:38:10.48
And

1465
01:38:11.28 --> 01:38:13.28
Did you go straight into

1466
01:38:13.84 --> 01:38:15.84
Straight into south straight into CQC?

1467
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:22.80
Yeah, so back then the the the senior enlisted of the assault cell he would like interview guys

1468
01:38:23.20 --> 01:38:27.36
To go to assaults because he was like hey if you're gonna come to assaults like we're screening

1469
01:38:27.36 --> 01:38:31.06
And so I remember him coming up talked to me while I was still a team one

1470
01:38:31.06 --> 01:38:33.76
I just got back from deployment so like yeah, you're going you're going to assaults

1471
01:38:34.32 --> 01:38:36.32
So I ended up going to south

1472
01:38:36.32 --> 01:38:38.32
But you know

1473
01:38:39.44 --> 01:38:47.84
Being the team guy I was like I can go to CQC to like yeah, sure you know, yeah, so I was doing CQC trips south trips and it was it was pretty cool and

1474
01:38:48.84 --> 01:38:54.14
You were there. That's when you were there and then JP was the OPO at the time. Yep. Yep. Yeah

1475
01:38:54.68 --> 01:38:57.68
What did you learn in sitting there teaching?

1476
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:04.52
You know, so now looking back I always told people that trade it was actually the biggest

1477
01:39:04.52 --> 01:39:10.12
Learning experience that I ever had because it's like the ultimate leadership lab

1478
01:39:10.76 --> 01:39:17.88
Because you get to watch two different styles of leadership go through and you're you're to completely detach

1479
01:39:17.88 --> 01:39:20.84
You have zero emotion and invested into that whatsoever

1480
01:39:20.84 --> 01:39:23.48
So you can armchair quarterback that stuff all day long

1481
01:39:25.80 --> 01:39:27.16
And

1482
01:39:27.16 --> 01:39:32.12
It was where you know, I started realizing the the difference in leadership

1483
01:39:32.12 --> 01:39:35.52
Hmm because if you think about it the talent is for the most part

1484
01:39:35.52 --> 01:39:39.02
Is it right out pretty evenly? You're gonna have some good some good guys

1485
01:39:39.02 --> 01:39:40.68
You can have a handful of new guys. You're gonna have some

1486
01:39:41.32 --> 01:39:48.000
E5 pipe hitters you're gonna have some couple slugs like the boys are gonna be pretty consistent

1487
01:39:48.32 --> 01:39:53.40
Most of the time yep. You're gonna get that so yeah, it all it all boils down to just how was the leadership?

1488
01:39:53.40 --> 01:39:55.40
How good is the leadership and if leadership good?

1489
01:39:55.40 --> 01:39:57.24
Between's gonna rock and if the leadership sucks

1490
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:02.72
We could have some problems yep, so that's when I started seeing that you know

1491
01:40:04.28 --> 01:40:06.52
Yeah, training is the same and I was like, okay

1492
01:40:06.52 --> 01:40:12.20
It really depends on that leadership how they're gonna do and it was really cool to see like the leadership that did well

1493
01:40:13.32 --> 01:40:18.08
It was simply because they were humble like you could just tell their attitude right off the bat

1494
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:21.48
Like they're like you know when you give them you know criticism or critiques or whatever

1495
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:24.64
They're like got it got it whereas the platoons that did terrible

1496
01:40:24.64 --> 01:40:31.48
They were just like you could just tell they had attitudes about hearing anything that any feedback that you had to give them and it was very

1497
01:40:31.60 --> 01:40:37.68
Blame like the difference between the the platoons that had humble leadership and the platoons that just did not

1498
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:45.64
I would like take this to the end degree in my own head because I always wanted to make sure that

1499
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:51.76
Hey, what am I doing am I doing a good job of getting through this individual leader, right?

1500
01:40:51.76 --> 01:40:56.98
And if it seems like this leader like maybe they have a big ego and they think they're a badass

1501
01:40:57.44 --> 01:41:02.24
You know, I don't care I always wanted to make sure that it wasn't me that it wasn't my end

1502
01:41:02.24 --> 01:41:04.72
I was like okay, you know what the guy's got a big ego. That's okay

1503
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:11.52
We want guys with big ego. So like you got to have a big ego. Let me rephrase that there's nothing you can't expect seals to not have

1504
01:41:12.12 --> 01:41:15.84
Some kind of ego like hey, I know how to do this some level of confidence, right?

1505
01:41:15.84 --> 01:41:19.40
You like so it's okay. I get it. You know you you think you're badass cool

1506
01:41:19.40 --> 01:41:24.56
I don't want to work for someone that doesn't think they're a badass right cool. I'm good with it. Okay. Let's move forward that

1507
01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:28.08
But man

1508
01:41:28.08 --> 01:41:33.88
You'd get these guys that occasionally again most most of the most of the leaders are like cool

1509
01:41:33.88 --> 01:41:38.92
That weren't we're down a cage. Now remember I remember once I we had this one leader coming through south

1510
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:39.92
and

1511
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:41.92
I talked to our

1512
01:41:41.92 --> 01:41:46.28
civilian that worked there who is a prior you know seal he was actually my

1513
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:50.68
My TUSCA when I was doing commander and I said hey, bro man

1514
01:41:50.68 --> 01:41:56.64
Just can you do me favor just check me on this like just look at this guy's face when I'm putting out word and just give me

1515
01:41:56.64 --> 01:41:58.64
I go cuz it seems to me

1516
01:41:58.80 --> 01:42:00.80
Like it doesn't want to hear anything from anybody

1517
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:06.88
I just want to make sure I'm not totally off base, but can you just check him out and so sure enough like as I

1518
01:42:07.24 --> 01:42:11.72
As I'm talking you look I've used that with his arms crossed and and and I get I'm just saying

1519
01:42:11.72 --> 01:42:15.72
I'm not even like saying do you're totally jacked up? I'm not saying anything like that

1520
01:42:15.72 --> 01:42:23.42
I'd say something like hey man, do you ever think about maybe you know putting some vehicles over here on this target and you can see the guys like arms

1521
01:42:23.42 --> 01:42:26.22
Car I'm not I'm just offering the suggestion

1522
01:42:26.22 --> 01:42:32.20
You know and they do arm costs and yeah, we get done with that debrief and that civilian comes up to me

1523
01:42:32.20 --> 01:42:37.64
And he's like bro this guy's freaking crazy and I said okay. I just wanted to make sure because it just

1524
01:42:39.40 --> 01:42:43.06
I guess the reason I'm saying this is because like I's intrigued at

1525
01:42:43.06 --> 01:42:45.06
That

1526
01:42:45.06 --> 01:42:50.28
The guys in trade at the attitude of our guys in trade at was just to try and help out our friends that are in the team

1527
01:42:50.28 --> 01:42:54.42
It's like that arena of puttune that that was the attitude the attitude. There's no like hey

1528
01:42:54.42 --> 01:42:56.90
I know how to do this you don't there was no

1529
01:42:57.62 --> 01:43:00.10
Matter of fact I wouldn't allow that kind of shit if we had instructors like that

1530
01:43:00.10 --> 01:43:04.38
I would freaking pull them aside because our instructors realize like oh

1531
01:43:04.50 --> 01:43:08.90
Where these guys are our friends there are teammates they're getting ready to deploy

1532
01:43:08.90 --> 01:43:14.58
We did do our best to help them out yeah, and and a lot of those guys know as much as what we know

1533
01:43:14.90 --> 01:43:18.46
Right, so you got a guy that's got a bunch of experience. I'm gonna bunch of deployments

1534
01:43:18.66 --> 01:43:23.54
They know as much as we know so cool. We're not attacking them. We're not talking down to them

1535
01:43:24.26 --> 01:43:29.68
So my point is if you have your friends that are trying to help you and

1536
01:43:30.46 --> 01:43:36.30
You reject them. It's really really bad. It's really really bad

1537
01:43:36.30 --> 01:43:41.86
It's it's horrible actually and if you such a bummer to see me it'd be such a bummer to see

1538
01:43:42.38 --> 01:43:48.56
Cuz literally like every guy at trade-at was just hey these are my friends and I'm trying to help and

1539
01:43:50.46 --> 01:43:56.30
If why aren't you open to us helping you please like we don't want you to get hurt man so

1540
01:43:58.26 --> 01:44:00.94
Yeah good times this freaking um

1541
01:44:00.94 --> 01:44:07.46
Great place to learn yeah, and I was like I did that luckily when I was at sealed team one as a

1542
01:44:07.90 --> 01:44:13.34
E5 I worked in our training cell which is when the the team she's trained themselves and so I got to do the same thing

1543
01:44:13.34 --> 01:44:17.78
When I was young and that's where I learned the most of my stuff was doing that again

1544
01:44:17.78 --> 01:44:20.46
Sitting back detached watching guys go through potunes

1545
01:44:20.78 --> 01:44:28.02
We used to run the SQT classes in at the team. Yeah, so that was really eye-opening too because now you had the young officers and

1546
01:44:28.02 --> 01:44:30.02
And

1547
01:44:30.02 --> 01:44:33.60
You'd watch them and think this guy can't make any decision. Why can't you make any decisions?

1548
01:44:33.60 --> 01:44:37.62
Oh, it's cuz he's shooting his right weapon right now and he shouldn't be given the two by four

1549
01:44:37.62 --> 01:44:42.86
Give him a stick let him get off his gun and he'll figure it out and then you actually learn how to do that for yourself

1550
01:44:42.86 --> 01:44:46.02
So yeah, if you want it really want to learn something

1551
01:44:46.02 --> 01:44:52.38
It's really advantageous to have an opportunity to teach it as well. Yeah, that was also where I learned how to like breathe and

1552
01:44:52.98 --> 01:44:57.46
Not I wouldn't say public speak, but you know like when you're talking to team guys

1553
01:44:57.46 --> 01:45:00.02
Yeah, you better be square away. Yeah, because they are

1554
01:45:00.54 --> 01:45:06.90
Chomping at the bit. Oh, yeah to like sense any weakness or anything that you say that's maybe not

1555
01:45:07.02 --> 01:45:12.46
Tactically correct. So it's where I learned to be very deliberate about the way I spoke

1556
01:45:13.06 --> 01:45:17.98
Public a debriefed. Yeah, and if you don't have if you don't have anything that's smart to say

1557
01:45:17.98 --> 01:45:20.46
Don't say anything and if you have a thought

1558
01:45:21.14 --> 01:45:25.70
That you haven't fought through either think through it or presented in such a way that

1559
01:45:25.70 --> 01:45:30.02
It's not like an aggressive attack

1560
01:45:30.94 --> 01:45:37.50
That's absolutely true. You know you're no seal-platoon. You don't have to be in trade it. You're no seal-platoon and you disagree with someone else

1561
01:45:38.90 --> 01:45:44.30
What are the chances that you're 100% right? Yeah, the chance that you're 100% right are almost zero

1562
01:45:44.82 --> 01:45:50.26
So eventually probably two weeks into my first platoon I realized oh

1563
01:45:50.26 --> 01:45:56.82
I'm very seldom going to be a hundred percent right. Why don't I present ideas as if there an idea?

1564
01:45:56.98 --> 01:45:58.18
Not some

1565
01:45:58.18 --> 01:46:05.58
Perfectly formulated perfectly constructed notion that is 100% true because there's so few things that are like that

1566
01:46:06.10 --> 01:46:07.38
Yeah

1567
01:46:07.38 --> 01:46:10.26
Even the most like I talk about in leadership strategy and tactics

1568
01:46:11.38 --> 01:46:18.66
The OIC that I had that was awesome. He knew more than all of us combined and he would present ideas as if they were

1569
01:46:18.66 --> 01:46:23.90
Suggestions and ideas and he was always open to changing those ideas if somebody said something smarter

1570
01:46:24.86 --> 01:46:28.74
So you get to see that stuff over and over again. That's what's that's what's crazy though

1571
01:46:28.74 --> 01:46:31.30
You when you're working at trade-out as you see a platoon tonight

1572
01:46:31.62 --> 01:46:36.68
Do three four five runs another platoon do three four five runs and then a few weeks later

1573
01:46:36.68 --> 01:46:43.10
You're gonna see two other platoons with a bunch of different leadership do the same runs basically the same runs with the same people

1574
01:46:43.10 --> 01:46:49.10
And the variable is the leadership and then a few weeks after that you get to do it again and again and again and again

1575
01:46:49.10 --> 01:46:53.46
And you just start to see what works and what doesn't work and it's real obvious after a certain point

1576
01:46:53.62 --> 01:46:58.18
Yeah, my learning curve was very steep there. How long did you do it trade up?

1577
01:46:58.98 --> 01:47:00.98
So let's see I got there in 2008

1578
01:47:02.62 --> 01:47:04.98
and I think around

1579
01:47:06.42 --> 01:47:10.66
2010 or so it was it was like my time to rotate out, but we had gotten a new chief in and

1580
01:47:10.66 --> 01:47:12.66
And

1581
01:47:13.10 --> 01:47:17.22
So it's time for me to go to my LPO, but the new chief that came in I really liked him a lot

1582
01:47:17.38 --> 01:47:23.90
Just just awesome awesome guy and then he was just like hey, can you stay at trade it a little bit longer and then be my

1583
01:47:23.90 --> 01:47:28.74
LPO when it's my time to go because I'm not gonna be very long. Yeah, he's like I want you to be my LPO

1584
01:47:29.14 --> 01:47:31.42
I'm just like do you know I want to deploy man?

1585
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:36.62
I thought it's a long time. He's like okay, how about I send you on another argument?

1586
01:47:36.62 --> 01:47:38.86
I'm like I want the full one this time

1587
01:47:38.86 --> 01:47:44.10
So we're working hard hanging here. I was like I want a full deployment. He's like, okay, you got it

1588
01:47:44.30 --> 01:47:47.30
So I went back to Afghanistan

1589
01:47:48.06 --> 01:47:50.06
for another augment

1590
01:47:50.62 --> 01:47:56.26
It's part of the deal size and you're getting some good operational experience on your augments

1591
01:47:56.62 --> 01:48:01.98
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely live in the dream. Yeah, it was it was really cool

1592
01:48:01.98 --> 01:48:09.98
Just to see you know watch a different team do do different things and yeah, I learned a lot

1593
01:48:09.98 --> 01:48:11.98
I learned a lot from

1594
01:48:11.98 --> 01:48:18.98
It was the first time to where I kind of heard the T.L. like during a gun fight like just how calm and collected they were

1595
01:48:18.98 --> 01:48:25.66
It was just like as if nothing was happening and I didn't I remember that thinking about that in my head like I want to be like that

1596
01:48:25.98 --> 01:48:28.98
You know like okay cool. That's how I'm supposed to be

1597
01:48:28.98 --> 01:48:33.98
You know, so yeah, it was a really good experience again

1598
01:48:34.98 --> 01:48:39.98
And because you know my skin tone I was able to help them out in ways that

1599
01:48:40.98 --> 01:48:43.98
You know, maybe some of the other guys couldn't so some of the targets had to be done like during the daytime

1600
01:48:44.98 --> 01:48:53.98
So we had to like drive around and like milk trucks or something and because you know, I could fit in with the popular side just getting and like the passenger seat and be the navigation guy

1601
01:48:53.98 --> 01:48:59.98
So you're back to being a point man. Yeah, but drive into a local you know hoppyless and you're able to pull that off

1602
01:48:59.98 --> 01:49:04.38
Yeah, and that's also because yeah, so halfway through the deployment though. Okay, we need we need low's back

1603
01:49:04.98 --> 01:49:09.66
Like it assaults and then I was like hey, they want me back and then the team leader there was like let me call them

1604
01:49:09.98 --> 01:49:14.74
It's like actually we really need him over here. So they let me stay there. It's pretty beautiful. Yeah

1605
01:49:15.98 --> 01:49:22.62
But you end up did you end up did you end up then going with your chief in trade at to be his LPO

1606
01:49:22.62 --> 01:49:25.62
No, so around that time

1607
01:49:25.62 --> 01:49:32.62
They sent Johnny Kim over to assaults like just very temporarily because he was on his way to go to school

1608
01:49:32.62 --> 01:49:40.62
So he got picked up for this this program where the Navy picks like two people at the entire Navy and they sent him to go get some of our

1609
01:49:40.62 --> 01:49:42.62
Somehow Johnny Kim slipped through the crash

1610
01:49:42.62 --> 01:49:47.12
Yeah, right so he's like explaining this this program to me

1611
01:49:47.12 --> 01:49:54.12
Were basically you know that the Navy pays for you to go to med school afterwards and it sounded like a good deal and at the time

1612
01:49:54.12 --> 01:49:56.12
You know, I was feeling really guilty

1613
01:49:56.12 --> 01:49:58.12
I'm like the I'm just been gone a lot

1614
01:49:58.12 --> 01:50:04.12
And I was like feeling like I wasn't like the best father to my son even though I tried to spend as much time with him as possible

1615
01:50:04.12 --> 01:50:07.12
I always had that guilt and then there's a part of me

1616
01:50:07.12 --> 01:50:11.12
I was like you know what maybe I should get like a normal job and and be there for my son

1617
01:50:12.12 --> 01:50:16.12
So on a complete win like I put in my package for that exact same program

1618
01:50:16.12 --> 01:50:22.12
And I'm like dude if Johnny Kim is getting accepted to this thing the chances of me getting accepted are like slimmed and none

1619
01:50:22.12 --> 01:50:30.12
And so I'm getting ready to go back to a team with with that chief to go be as LPO and then I'm flying back from an assault trip

1620
01:50:30.12 --> 01:50:37.12
And then he's like hey, did you see the result? I'm like for what like I literally completely just I applied and just forgot about it

1621
01:50:37.12 --> 01:50:39.12
And I dude you got picked up for that program

1622
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:47.12
Oh my god, are you serious? He's like yeah, so I was like well, I guess get some going to school

1623
01:50:47.12 --> 01:50:57.12
Crazy go try a big doctor. There was a time period and it was this this was the time period where I'm not kidding seals had a really good reputation in the world

1624
01:50:57.12 --> 01:51:03.12
You know and it certainly in the Navy and I man guys were getting picked up left right and center for this kind of stuff

1625
01:51:03.12 --> 01:51:15.12
So I mean that's freaking crazy and awesome. Yeah, so what's funny is you know that I said they picked two people a year at the entire Navy and the other guy was a team guy too

1626
01:51:15.12 --> 01:51:29.12
Yeah, that's my point like that's crazy right. Yeah, but at that time and we like the seals were just doing a lot of good work and I mean I'm sure that when they looked at your record like seriously they looked at your record and

1627
01:51:29.12 --> 01:51:38.32
Compare that to the other applicants I bet it wasn't even really that close just because of the nature of what the seals were doing at the time. Yeah

1628
01:51:38.32 --> 01:51:46.48
So but did you have any intention of like going to medical school for however long that is so I thought I did

1629
01:51:46.48 --> 01:51:49.44
You know

1630
01:51:49.44 --> 01:51:54.72
So you a year behind Johnny yeah, okay, you're you're you're behind Johnny and Johnny went to USD

1631
01:51:54.72 --> 01:52:00.56
So I was just because I'm like yeah, I'm just gonna do what Johnny did so

1632
01:52:01.36 --> 01:52:06.72
So for we had to go to like that officer school it up in Rhode Island so yeah and

1633
01:52:06.72 --> 01:52:10.80
January of 2012 that's when I left trade it and we went to Rhode Island and

1634
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:14.72
So you learn how to be an officer. Do you get commissioned up there?

1635
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.08
No, you just go to school. Yeah, you just go to school. You don't get commissioned into you graduate from school

1636
01:52:20.08 --> 01:52:26.80
But that's actually where like you know, they're like oh you got to have blue camis. I'm like I don't own any blue camis

1637
01:52:27.52 --> 01:52:33.84
And what's funny about that so I didn't know so they have the you know the big blue jackets and those things are expensive

1638
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.32
Like 350 bucks and I'm already buying all these uniforms that I didn't have because I don't have any blue stuff

1639
01:52:39.32 --> 01:52:41.32
And either you're gonna go to ROTC

1640
01:52:41.32 --> 01:52:48.40
Yeah, what you're gonna have to do yeah after work, but you don't have to wear blue camis for the knife and force cool up in Rhode Island correct

1641
01:52:48.40 --> 01:52:54.04
God it so my but the other team guy that they're with me, you know, we go there and he's he's cheap to

1642
01:52:54.04 --> 01:52:57.96
So he's like oh by this jackass like I don't want by either. I was like screw it. Let's not buy it

1643
01:52:57.96 --> 01:53:01.80
You know, you know jacket you know even though it's Rhode Island in January

1644
01:53:02.48 --> 01:53:06.40
So we form up. Yeah, we form up and I'm in my blue camis

1645
01:53:06.40 --> 01:53:11.96
He's on blue camis and you know the chief the chief who's like the RDC or whatever it's called, you know

1646
01:53:12.32 --> 01:53:15.04
He's like oh how come you guys don't have jackets? I was like well

1647
01:53:15.04 --> 01:53:19.08
We know we didn't want to buy them because we're literally gonna have them here when never gonna use them again

1648
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:20.08
And they're really expensive

1649
01:53:20.08 --> 01:53:22.96
He's like well, we're all uniformed around here

1650
01:53:22.96 --> 01:53:28.56
So they make everybody take their jackets off and it's it's freezing cool and then

1651
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:34.08
He's like we'll keep doing this until you guys buy jackets and I told my buddy

1652
01:53:34.08 --> 01:53:36.08
Don't you dare buy a jacket?

1653
01:53:36.08 --> 01:53:40.24
It's like okay cool and we were freezing cold, but we would just sit there and be like we're not cold

1654
01:53:40.24 --> 01:53:41.68
But we were we're dying

1655
01:53:41.68 --> 01:53:45.68
And got to the point where they're like you know people started crying in the class like literally like oh

1656
01:53:46.24 --> 01:53:48.64
You know freezing cold, so they're like all right changing to your cackies

1657
01:53:49.36 --> 01:53:52.88
I was like okay, I'll buy the jacket for the cackies come part. I might use that later on

1658
01:53:54.64 --> 01:53:59.84
So you're done with that and then you go to you go to you list usd

1659
01:54:01.36 --> 01:54:04.16
University of San Diego you're gonna be doing the same

1660
01:54:05.60 --> 01:54:09.60
Whatever the same thing Johnny did yeah trying to get your pre-med knocked out

1661
01:54:09.60 --> 01:54:12.56
Yeah, how'd that go for you?

1662
01:54:12.56 --> 01:54:14.56
Not well

1663
01:54:14.56 --> 01:54:16.56
Johnny Kim

1664
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:23.28
I'm miserable, you know, I'm I'm taken like 18 to 21 units a semester

1665
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:24.96
I

1666
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:31.36
Really didn't enjoy the classes I was taking like chemistry biology just stuff that was so boring to me

1667
01:54:32.16 --> 01:54:36.40
And then a top at all off. I'm I'm doing parking services because you know USD's a private school

1668
01:54:36.40 --> 01:54:42.24
And the Navy only pays like I think it was like I don't I shouldn't say only they pay 10k

1669
01:54:43.12 --> 01:54:47.28
And the tuition at USD's like 40k a year like 40 something k a year so

1670
01:54:47.84 --> 01:54:51.44
They're like hey if you do parking services it'll pay off the rest of your tuition

1671
01:54:51.92 --> 01:54:53.92
So it's a good deal like if you really break it down

1672
01:54:54.48 --> 01:54:56.08
The amount of hours that you work

1673
01:54:56.08 --> 01:55:03.44
It's a really good deal so I'm driving around this this car giving people tickets at USD and bad karma dude

1674
01:55:03.44 --> 01:55:09.76
Yeah, well, I almost you know almost gotten to this big altercation at one point so

1675
01:55:11.12 --> 01:55:14.24
You know that so this other team guy you're the worst ticket guy to mess with

1676
01:55:15.28 --> 01:55:19.84
Fatsin that you think you're getting a thing you know already with some random ticket do you know it's freaking loves

1677
01:55:19.84 --> 01:55:21.28
Prop

1678
01:55:21.84 --> 01:55:24.56
Well, it's you know it's funny it's like if I have to hear you know

1679
01:55:24.56 --> 01:55:29.60
Do you know my dad is one more time just like bro? I don't know your dad is I'm really sorry, but you know you're parking the handicaps box

1680
01:55:30.32 --> 01:55:32.32
but at one point

1681
01:55:32.32 --> 01:55:37.68
So the parking so it's me and another team guy so that the other parking services kids, you know

1682
01:55:37.68 --> 01:55:41.20
They actually they're normal kids. I won't go on a school and I like oh if you guys want to get a lot of tickets

1683
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:47.68
You got to go down to this area right here and it was like where the football field or the baseball field was you know by the gym

1684
01:55:47.68 --> 01:55:49.04
You went to USD right?

1685
01:55:49.04 --> 01:55:53.04
You know what I'm talking about so my buddy. I didn't do ticket parking

1686
01:55:53.84 --> 01:55:59.68
I said I said put my bike in my station wagon and just I would park off campus and just bike whatever

1687
01:55:59.68 --> 01:56:03.52
Need me bike on bike back in my car and drive home. Yeah, so at one point, you know

1688
01:56:03.52 --> 01:56:07.12
I we go down there and it's like it's like the jackpot of all

1689
01:56:07.68 --> 01:56:12.08
Like violations like we got because we were having trouble meeting our quota so this other team guy

1690
01:56:12.08 --> 01:56:15.52
And I you know the other parking service kids like if you go down in this area you get lots of tickets

1691
01:56:15.52 --> 01:56:19.36
So we go down there and we're like oh heck yeah, yeah, there's all kinds of violations down there

1692
01:56:19.36 --> 01:56:23.76
Like we met our quota super quick and at one point I had come up to this car and I you know

1693
01:56:23.76 --> 01:56:27.28
You got to punch in the license plate to to give him the ticket and it was like

1694
01:56:27.28 --> 01:56:32.32
Do not let like call the office immediately if you see if you get this license plate

1695
01:56:32.32 --> 01:56:38.32
Everyone okay, yeah, so I call it. I'm like hey this thing came up on my little gadget and then I do not let that person leave

1696
01:56:38.32 --> 01:56:44.32
They have like nine unpaid tickets or something like that. I was insane about I'm like what do you want me to do?

1697
01:56:45.04 --> 01:56:49.20
Like park your cart behind his car until the tow truck gets there and do not let them leave

1698
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:54.32
I'm like is that legal are we allowed to do that and and and they're like yeah

1699
01:56:54.32 --> 01:56:59.20
So I'm like okay, so I parked my park my cart behind this car the other team guy

1700
01:56:59.20 --> 01:57:00.96
I don't know where he took off to like he's gone

1701
01:57:01.52 --> 01:57:06.64
He must have been fine and like lots of tickets and so I'm sitting there and waiting for the tow truck and now

1702
01:57:06.64 --> 01:57:08.64
I see everybody get out of football practice and

1703
01:57:10.08 --> 01:57:13.28
The guys car the car who's you know

1704
01:57:13.52 --> 01:57:16.08
Part behind the owner comes and it's a really big dude

1705
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:19.60
You know he's free of football player free jack dude big dude. He's like

1706
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:22.40
Hey, you need to move your cart

1707
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:27.60
I was like hey bro there seems to be a problem like you know with your ticket stuff

1708
01:57:28.16 --> 01:57:32.56
I'm like they called the tow truck but I think if you call them, you know and work something out

1709
01:57:33.04 --> 01:57:35.04
He's like

1710
01:57:35.04 --> 01:57:40.56
Move your fucking car. I was like I can't you know they told me this and and now it's starting to be cut

1711
01:57:40.56 --> 01:57:43.36
And I'm really like trying to be like hey bro like listen

1712
01:57:43.36 --> 01:57:47.68
I am like the low man on the total pull and now the rest of the football team is coming out

1713
01:57:47.68 --> 01:57:52.000
And now they're getting fired up and now I'm sitting there and I'm like where the hell is this other team guy at

1714
01:57:52.56 --> 01:57:55.60
This is a matter how good of a fighter you are there's a punch of that. We're gonna get trash kicked

1715
01:57:56.08 --> 01:57:59.44
So and then the guys like move your cart now. I'm gonna beat your ass

1716
01:57:59.92 --> 01:58:03.36
Now I'm like listen bro. I really don't want that but listen if you put your hands on me

1717
01:58:03.36 --> 01:58:05.12
I'm telling right now. I'm gonna defend myself and

1718
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.60
At that point I'm thinking dang it man. This is really gonna happen and

1719
01:58:10.08 --> 01:58:13.12
Some guy comes running through them all and then he's like hey

1720
01:58:13.44 --> 01:58:15.44
Do you know who this guy is?

1721
01:58:15.44 --> 01:58:19.36
And I'm like who is this guy and yeah, who am I like who is this guy? I am

1722
01:58:19.92 --> 01:58:24.80
You know and then he's like he's freaking maybe seal and then you just see their attitude

1723
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:29.44
Come pully please like oh I'm really sorry sir like I didn't know you know

1724
01:58:29.44 --> 01:58:32.16
I and I was like hey bro. It's really cool like you know

1725
01:58:32.16 --> 01:58:34.24
I'm pretty sure if you just call you can work something out

1726
01:58:34.40 --> 01:58:41.12
Turns out this guy was the running back was a prior team guy. Oh no sure and he knew that the parking service is guys

1727
01:58:41.12 --> 01:58:48.40
We're other team guys that we're trying to you know pay for the rest of their tuition so he saved me that day because I'm probably wasn't gonna go down very pretty for me

1728
01:58:50.24 --> 01:58:54.96
And then you eventually just change to change your major and you get out of the medical program

1729
01:58:55.36 --> 01:58:58.72
Yeah, so at some point I'm just like I took a finance class as one of my

1730
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:02.16
Electives and I'm like man I really like this and I really miss the teams

1731
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:06.16
I don't think I want to do this medical thing so I change my major without telling anybody and

1732
01:59:06.64 --> 01:59:09.76
Then when they're like oh, so where are you gonna go to med school? I was like about that

1733
01:59:09.76 --> 01:59:13.28
I'm actually I want to go back to the teams if that's okay

1734
01:59:13.44 --> 01:59:16.32
So I want to finish my degree and go back to the teams and they were a live it

1735
01:59:16.88 --> 01:59:22.88
Damn they're just like teams like no you're you're going slow you're gonna go be a surface work

1736
01:59:22.88 --> 01:59:25.36
Oh my god, so now I'm just like

1737
01:59:26.64 --> 01:59:30.56
I don't know what to do so you know I make some phone calls and they're like that's stupid

1738
01:59:30.56 --> 01:59:32.56
You're not gonna go be a slow you're turning back here

1739
01:59:32.96 --> 01:59:37.04
The only the only problem is you're gonna have to go to the process just like everyone else

1740
01:59:37.04 --> 01:59:39.84
So I have to take the screener do an interview

1741
01:59:41.04 --> 01:59:44.40
I'm like yeah, that's totally fine. So I do the screener

1742
01:59:44.40 --> 01:59:51.28
I go do the interview and one of the interviewers is one of my old co from team one and he knows who I am

1743
01:59:52.56 --> 01:59:57.44
So I'm thinking oh this is gonna go great, you know and at one point he asks me

1744
01:59:58.40 --> 02:00:03.52
He's like hey, so what are you gonna do if you don't get picked up for for special warfare

1745
02:00:03.52 --> 02:00:08.24
And then um as an officer, you know and I sound was like well

1746
02:00:08.80 --> 02:00:11.76
I am just gonna give up my commission and go back to being and listen

1747
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:14.88
And you just see everyone's head just go oh

1748
02:00:15.44 --> 02:00:19.68
And then that moment just seen the expression on their faces. I was like oh man

1749
02:00:19.68 --> 02:00:21.68
I said something I wasn't supposed to

1750
02:00:22.88 --> 02:00:24.24
And you know

1751
02:00:24.24 --> 02:00:28.56
Because you're supposed to say hey, I want to be an officer no matter what and

1752
02:00:28.56 --> 02:00:35.60
And he was really cool about it. He's like listen, low, you know, you know why I mean it's like I'm gonna give you one more chance at this

1753
02:00:35.60 --> 02:00:37.60
Okay, I'm gonna give you another crack at it

1754
02:00:37.60 --> 02:00:39.60
I wasn't the best answer

1755
02:00:39.60 --> 02:00:41.28
And then I sat there and I'm like

1756
02:00:41.28 --> 02:00:43.60
Dang it. I might have messed this up

1757
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:46.72
So I sat there for a minute and just thought about it and I'm like you know what sir?

1758
02:00:47.12 --> 02:00:49.76
I know that the correct answer that you want to hear is like

1759
02:00:50.32 --> 02:00:51.76
If you don't get picked up for this

1760
02:00:51.76 --> 02:00:57.12
I'm gonna go be the best swore the best sub-mariner officer on the planet and then I'm gonna make my way back

1761
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:02.16
But I'll be honest with you. I don't want to do that. I was like I just want to be in the teams and

1762
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:06.32
Whether that says an IPO achieve or is an officer. I was like that's why I'm doing this

1763
02:01:06.32 --> 02:01:10.80
I miss the teams. I want to go back and he's like that's the answer you want to go with

1764
02:01:10.88 --> 02:01:12.88
I'm like yes, sir. It's just the truth

1765
02:01:13.76 --> 02:01:15.76
And then he's like to bold move

1766
02:01:16.08 --> 02:01:18.08
Don't know if it's gonna work out for you

1767
02:01:18.08 --> 02:01:20.56
I like that but yeah eventually I got picked up so

1768
02:01:22.48 --> 02:01:24.48
Back to the teams

1769
02:01:24.48 --> 02:01:29.84
So where'd you go? What team so I was originally supposed to go to team five and

1770
02:01:30.64 --> 02:01:36.08
That old chief that I was talking about the one why me be his opio and then the master chief who was the SCA

1771
02:01:36.08 --> 02:01:39.36
Assaults there they're like hey because they came to my commissioning like we're going

1772
02:01:39.36 --> 02:01:40.88
I was like oh I'm going to team five though like no, you're not

1773
02:01:42.72 --> 02:01:47.60
You're coming to team three boom and I was like whoa, you know and they're like trust me

1774
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.32
We'll make it work so some trades were made

1775
02:01:50.32 --> 02:01:58.000
Like they gave up a couple of their jails and I'm to five and whoever the jail one of the jails was in the pollton because they had already started work up

1776
02:01:58.88 --> 02:02:01.52
Base sent this poor kid away and he started work up

1777
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.56
So now I go in there and I'm there with all my buddies

1778
02:02:05.36 --> 02:02:12.08
Like I knew the LPO I was at assaults with the LPO the chief. This is your platoon that you could put into you're the aOS

1779
02:02:12.08 --> 02:02:17.04
They watchy yeah, and you just they're all your boys all my friends from LPO on up

1780
02:02:17.04 --> 02:02:20.64
Yeah, I didn't know everybody else you know down there but I

1781
02:02:21.36 --> 02:02:24.56
Then cool good it was awesome. Yeah, the OIC

1782
02:02:24.96 --> 02:02:28.16
So they put me in that platoon because they were like hey the OIC

1783
02:02:28.72 --> 02:02:31.12
You know, he's a really good dude. He's just a little

1784
02:02:32.48 --> 02:02:34.80
They used the word timid. He's just kind of shy

1785
02:02:34.80 --> 02:02:38.40
He wasn't a very outspoken guy and then when I heard him brief and I heard him on the radio

1786
02:02:38.40 --> 02:02:41.84
I'm like oh, I see where's like I have no problem getting on the radio

1787
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:43.04
I've no problem briefing

1788
02:02:43.04 --> 02:02:50.40
So we actually complement each other very well because he was a good officer like he knew officer things that I did not

1789
02:02:50.72 --> 02:02:56.32
So he showed me how to be you know like ground force commander. He showed me like all the checklists all the procedures and

1790
02:02:57.04 --> 02:03:01.04
And yeah, it was it was a good experience and I got a lot of reps

1791
02:03:01.68 --> 02:03:05.60
You know being the OIC because I was I was good on the radio

1792
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:09.28
So I got a lot of reps and our our chief was a complete stud who I'd went to Buds with

1793
02:03:09.28 --> 02:03:14.88
So I learned a ton from him too. He's a J-Taxle. He taught me a lot about being ground force commander

1794
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:17.92
Where did you guys go into plunder we ended up going to

1795
02:03:18.32 --> 02:03:20.32
Alta Cateum

1796
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:21.44
Yeah

1797
02:03:21.44 --> 02:03:25.60
So we were there for the double a just advised an assist

1798
02:03:26.08 --> 02:03:28.80
So there was no a company at that time

1799
02:03:29.28 --> 02:03:33.04
So we were just behind the flaw just calling in helping them

1800
02:03:33.04 --> 02:03:39.60
I rack his call in air to try to retake Alambar which had been retaken by bicell

1801
02:03:40.64 --> 02:03:42.96
You know whatever the name of the week was for them yeah

1802
02:03:44.08 --> 02:03:46.08
And that's

1803
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:49.28
How's the platoon what is the platoon doing as you're doing that?

1804
02:03:50.88 --> 02:03:54.32
I mean so really the only ones that are working are the J-Taxle

1805
02:03:55.36 --> 02:03:57.36
Yeah, they're really the only ones that are working

1806
02:03:58.88 --> 02:04:00.88
But I mean at least you're freaking killing bad guys

1807
02:04:00.88 --> 02:04:01.68
Yeah, absolutely

1808
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:07.76
But we're also eating motors a lot because we can't go forward

1809
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.28
So we're just sitting back there eating motors and at one point

1810
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.72
The motors got really really close to us blue one of our homies up

1811
02:04:16.40 --> 02:04:19.68
As I was running towards it this homie gets hit just

1812
02:04:20.80 --> 02:04:22.80
Close me on my ass

1813
02:04:22.80 --> 02:04:25.44
So just definitely a TBI

1814
02:04:25.92 --> 02:04:28.72
So they like put me on TBI protocol for a little bit but

1815
02:04:28.72 --> 02:04:30.72
But

1816
02:04:30.72 --> 02:04:33.68
Right around that time I get an email telling me like hey

1817
02:04:34.48 --> 02:04:36.56
From this chief of mine now he's the SEA now

1818
02:04:36.56 --> 02:04:40.64
He's the SEA at this point. He's like hey, los you're you know we're gonna actually send you to Baghdad

1819
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:44.000
And you're gonna replace this J-O is the strike so commander

1820
02:04:45.28 --> 02:04:51.28
I'm thinking like why like I don't know anything about J-Taxle stuff and the J-O that was there

1821
02:04:51.28 --> 02:04:53.28
He'd actually gone to like a J-Taxle

1822
02:04:53.28 --> 02:04:59.76
Really really intelligent guy like super intelligent waste smarter than me and I'm like what am I gonna do over there?

1823
02:05:00.08 --> 02:05:02.08
I don't know anything about

1824
02:05:02.08 --> 02:05:04.80
You know, and he's like and so it's funny because

1825
02:05:05.92 --> 02:05:10.96
As I'm getting on the Hilo to leave he's getting there and we're crossing paths and I'm like bro

1826
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:15.44
Why am I getting sent there like I don't know what I'm doing he's like don't worry about it dude people like you

1827
02:05:16.16 --> 02:05:18.16
I'm just like okay

1828
02:05:18.16 --> 02:05:20.16
He's like you're gonna be fine

1829
02:05:20.16 --> 02:05:23.28
So I know it gets a Baghdad and and I

1830
02:05:23.28 --> 02:05:26.32
I'm getting the turnover from this J-O and I could immediately see

1831
02:05:26.88 --> 02:05:32.16
That these gent the general there is just not a fan of ours and then through conversation

1832
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.76
We had we had we had burned some relationships there

1833
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:43.84
And backtracking though when I checked into team three guess who my CEO is

1834
02:05:44.72 --> 02:05:46.72
It's my first OIC

1835
02:05:46.72 --> 02:05:51.12
Right on man and you want to talk about like a lack of relationship building

1836
02:05:51.92 --> 02:05:57.12
When I show up he was just like hey you're that guy that got in trouble for such and such thing

1837
02:05:57.60 --> 02:05:59.84
Right on and I'm like you can awesome no

1838
02:06:00.32 --> 02:06:05.52
I'm like that wasn't me that was someone else who doesn't even look like me like he's a white dude

1839
02:06:05.52 --> 02:06:07.52
Like it's nothing like me

1840
02:06:07.52 --> 02:06:10.56
So I'm like way to go man we spent two years together and you're in a who I am

1841
02:06:10.96 --> 02:06:12.16
That's great

1842
02:06:12.16 --> 02:06:16.48
Yeah, but anyway, so back to the story the the relationship had definitely been

1843
02:06:16.48 --> 02:06:19.28
Strange I could just tell by the way this this general was talking to the J-O

1844
02:06:20.08 --> 02:06:21.36
It's just like

1845
02:06:21.36 --> 02:06:23.36
He did not like us and

1846
02:06:23.84 --> 02:06:28.88
You know like I said this J-O was very brilliant really knew his J-Tax stuff and so now I'm left there

1847
02:06:29.92 --> 02:06:32.16
And I'm thinking like man we got a repair this relationship

1848
02:06:32.64 --> 02:06:36.48
So that's actually the first thing I started doing the general was a Marine Corps general

1849
02:06:37.20 --> 02:06:40.56
And so I was just chatting him up just like hey, you know where we're station where you station now

1850
02:06:40.56 --> 02:06:41.68
He's like oh camp penulton

1851
02:06:41.68 --> 02:06:43.28
I'm like oh that was my first duty station

1852
02:06:43.28 --> 02:06:49.28
He's like what are you doing there? I was like oh he's the B&F MF Corment and yeah his eyes just light up

1853
02:06:49.84 --> 02:06:55.04
And from that point on you know him and I just start chatting and then I you know start asking him like hey, you know

1854
02:06:55.60 --> 02:06:59.36
What is it that you guys are looking for when you're looking for these for these strikes to be approved?

1855
02:06:59.84 --> 02:07:02.32
What can we do to help out what you guys are doing?

1856
02:07:02.32 --> 02:07:06.72
He's like as a matter of fact, you know we need this this and that and I'm like check let me see what we can do about it

1857
02:07:07.36 --> 02:07:09.36
And so what my job was

1858
02:07:09.36 --> 02:07:12.56
Was I would get all these air strikes for the next day

1859
02:07:12.56 --> 02:07:18.000
That my platoon wanted to carry out strategically strategic air strikes and I had to brief them to

1860
02:07:18.64 --> 02:07:24.08
To him and another general to the one and a two-star general get him approved in a room full of kernels that were all

1861
02:07:24.08 --> 02:07:26.56
Jags and super risk adverse like they were

1862
02:07:27.04 --> 02:07:32.40
Denying a lot of the air strikes and that's the reason why I said me over there like hey a lot of our stuff's getting denied go see if maybe you can change that up

1863
02:07:33.60 --> 02:07:38.24
So so I go in there and and I grab one of my TATX

1864
02:07:38.24 --> 02:07:42.88
You know this is actually of where I had like what another epiphany where I'm like you know what is a leader?

1865
02:07:42.88 --> 02:07:47.92
I don't have to know everything. I'm like I have someone who went to J-Tax school

1866
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.76
So I'm just gonna lean on them because at the time I'm like I don't know what I'm doing

1867
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:56.64
I was really like insecure about it like I'm gonna go in there and just not know what to brief

1868
02:07:56.64 --> 02:07:58.08
So I told him I'm like hey listen

1869
02:07:58.08 --> 02:08:04.08
I'm gonna brief strategic picture like why we're doing these air strikes anything technical you can answer it

1870
02:08:04.08 --> 02:08:09.44
And he was like check so that's how I would do my briefs and like I said I built that relationship with that general

1871
02:08:09.44 --> 02:08:15.36
So every time I briefed you know and they went around the corner taking the vote he would always take my side and once he was in

1872
02:08:15.60 --> 02:08:18.64
The two-star was gonna be in as well no matter what the Jack said

1873
02:08:19.44 --> 02:08:21.44
So from that point on

1874
02:08:21.44 --> 02:08:24.32
From I could remember we got all our air strikes approved from that point on

1875
02:08:24.80 --> 02:08:26.40
It was just a simple

1876
02:08:26.40 --> 02:08:30.000
Relationship building what what had the J-O the smart J-O

1877
02:08:30.80 --> 02:08:33.12
Was it something he did or was it just he was not

1878
02:08:33.12 --> 02:08:35.12
How something are you doing?

1879
02:08:35.12 --> 02:08:40.000
So just how to bad relationship out of the gate. Yeah, yeah, and then he had a bad taste in his mouth

1880
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.96
I think team guys on that particular deployment

1881
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:47.60
He made some some comments here and there that I caught on very quickly like check

1882
02:08:49.76 --> 02:08:53.76
Freakin horrible and you're did are you married again at this point?

1883
02:08:54.64 --> 02:08:56.64
Yeah, so

1884
02:08:57.20 --> 02:09:01.12
So yeah, so when I was in trade it I actually met my wife she was my waitress

1885
02:09:01.12 --> 02:09:04.08
a very a classy establishment

1886
02:09:05.92 --> 02:09:07.92
Jack called butters

1887
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.40
But I went in there with a team guy and I remember seeing her and I'm thinking like oh my god

1888
02:09:14.40 --> 02:09:19.20
She's gorgeous like there's absolutely no way someone like that would you know go for someone like me and

1889
02:09:19.92 --> 02:09:22.24
And turns out that I had gone a couple dates with one of her friends

1890
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:26.64
So she had told so she told her friend she's like oh, you know I saw that that guy

1891
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:29.44
He said at my table that you were dating. She's like oh, we're not dating anymore

1892
02:09:29.44 --> 02:09:36.24
She was like do you care if I get his number? She's like no, so yeah, so that's how he ended up meeting and

1893
02:09:37.28 --> 02:09:43.20
So at this point, you know, we've been together for a while since trade it and now I was already you know

1894
02:09:44.08 --> 02:09:49.36
Am I OIC and she's just like hey you need to marry me if you don't marry me before this deployment

1895
02:09:49.36 --> 02:09:51.36
And I'm not gonna be here when you get back

1896
02:09:52.16 --> 02:09:54.16
So ultimately I'm delivered

1897
02:09:54.16 --> 02:10:01.60
And and it you know is a hard decision for me because I was like man I love this woman but we you know

1898
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:08.56
Vodalot and during that deployment that one to Tyrak our relationship was very very stressed

1899
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:14.40
You had just got married before you went on the pool yeah, yeah, yeah, and I'm thinking to myself like you know

1900
02:10:14.40 --> 02:10:18.96
I'm gonna fail at this marriage thing again like what am I what what am I doing wrong here

1901
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:25.04
And what's crazy is like when I was at trade at you know you talked about the the four laws of combat a lot and we talked about like

1902
02:10:25.36 --> 02:10:31.12
Find what your red flags are and in the teams my red flag when I got overwhelmed was

1903
02:10:32.96 --> 02:10:37.76
You know when that thought came in my head like I don't know what to do right now. That was my cue to detach

1904
02:10:38.64 --> 02:10:40.64
Prioritize an excuse and

1905
02:10:40.96 --> 02:10:45.68
For the longest time I thought that these four laws of combat this this ocean was only

1906
02:10:45.68 --> 02:10:50.24
Combat related and it was the first time in my life where I realized that

1907
02:10:51.36 --> 02:10:55.20
It's for your personal life too because at that point, you know I got back from the poiment

1908
02:10:55.20 --> 02:11:00.000
We're still fighting a lot, but I'm like man. I love this woman. I don't want I don't want to fail at this marriage thing again

1909
02:11:00.32 --> 02:11:02.72
And in my head I thought I don't know what to do right now

1910
02:11:03.84 --> 02:11:06.32
And that's when I clicked for me like wait a minute

1911
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:09.76
I've had this thought like literally hundreds of times when I'm on training missions

1912
02:11:09.76 --> 02:11:14.88
I'm like well I'm a little overwhelmed. I don't know what to do right now detach prioritize execute and so at that point

1913
02:11:14.88 --> 02:11:21.04
I'm like I need to attach prioritize an excuse in my personal life and it was at that point in my life

1914
02:11:21.04 --> 02:11:25.52
Why decided to start taking ownership of of my mistakes and realize that you know what?

1915
02:11:25.60 --> 02:11:29.28
I'm an imperfect human being too and I stopped concentrating on

1916
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Everything that I thought was a flaw

1917
02:11:32.80 --> 02:11:37.44
On her part and just started concentrating on how I could become a better husband

1918
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:42.80
So I'm like hey, you know what this is what I do wrong and this is how I can fix it

1919
02:11:42.80 --> 02:11:46.88
I have no control over attitude. I have no the things that I had don't have control over

1920
02:11:46.88 --> 02:11:51.28
I stopped worrying about them and I started concentrating on the things that I could control

1921
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:56.80
And at first it was a little bit of a campaign because you could tell she was like what are you doing?

1922
02:11:59.12 --> 02:12:03.12
And then and then it got to the point where she started doing the same thing

1923
02:12:03.76 --> 02:12:08.16
Like we just started taking ownership of our parts of the marriage and I stopped worrying about what she did wrong

1924
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:13.44
And only worried about what I was doing wrong and she eventually she started to do the same and her marriage is

1925
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:19.68
Completely turned around since then and you know, I'm a little marriage you got peaks and valleys, but it's it's been

1926
02:12:21.52 --> 02:12:22.72
Amazing

1927
02:12:22.72 --> 02:12:27.52
Kind of like when you're in a platoon like where everybody's taking ownership of stuff for no one's blaming anybody else

1928
02:12:27.60 --> 02:12:32.48
Which is trying to solve problems. And that's how that environment finally was in my marriage

1929
02:12:33.12 --> 02:12:35.12
So yeah, it's

1930
02:12:35.12 --> 02:12:38.80
It's funny when you talk about like when you're in a platoon and everyone starts taking ownership stuff

1931
02:12:38.80 --> 02:12:40.16
You know problems get solved

1932
02:12:40.16 --> 02:12:42.80
What's crazy is the opposite of that?

1933
02:12:43.52 --> 02:12:48.80
It's not one level of badness when people aren't taking ownership because when they're not taking ownership

1934
02:12:48.80 --> 02:12:53.68
They're blaming each other so it's not just oh we're gonna blame each other and that's that's not good

1935
02:12:54.08 --> 02:12:59.36
That's not good, but guess what else is coming now? We're fighting where yelling each other like it causes

1936
02:12:59.36 --> 02:13:05.84
Exponential problems beyond just it's not just oh if I take ownership the problems get solved if I don't take ownership

1937
02:13:05.84 --> 02:13:09.36
The problems don't get solved if it was that simple it'd be like you probably deal with it

1938
02:13:09.52 --> 02:13:13.92
But it's now we actually are fighting we're undermining each other we're yelling at each other

1939
02:13:13.92 --> 02:13:21.12
We we're turning to freaking idiots and so yeah, and that can happen in people's personal lives, too

1940
02:13:21.12 --> 02:13:28.000
You know you it's not just that oh well we've got this problem in our marriage and it's not my fault

1941
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.32
It's your fault if that's where it stopped

1942
02:13:31.04 --> 02:13:35.76
You might be able to muddle you away through it, but that's not where it stops. Yeah, it stopped me say it's your fault

1943
02:13:35.76 --> 02:13:37.76
What do you mean is my fault?

1944
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:43.04
Actually here's some of the nine things that are your fault and but all of a sudden we have not just one little problem

1945
02:13:43.12 --> 02:13:45.44
That's not getting solved you have exponential

1946
02:13:45.92 --> 02:13:50.08
Problems across the board it's a freaking disaster. Yeah, it's a game changer

1947
02:13:50.64 --> 02:13:51.76
um

1948
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:53.76
Now you came back from that deployment and

1949
02:13:53.76 --> 02:14:00.48
You actually did a couple years where you were doing some some classified stuff

1950
02:14:01.68 --> 02:14:03.68
overseas and

1951
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:06.56
Obviously we can't talk about things that are classified

1952
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:11.44
But maybe some unclassified lessons learned from what you were doing yeah

1953
02:14:13.84 --> 02:14:18.000
I think the biggest thing that I learned while I was over there is is how to build relationships

1954
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:24.40
Hmm and honestly I got I got really into it and I started trying to perfect that craft by reading books

1955
02:14:24.40 --> 02:14:27.68
So I started reading books like how to win friends and influence people

1956
02:14:28.32 --> 02:14:34.48
The like switch like anything I could help get my hands on because I knew that when I was over there

1957
02:14:34.72 --> 02:14:36.72
It was just gonna be me and one other operator

1958
02:14:37.52 --> 02:14:42.08
That's it we didn't have like a support system we didn't have a platoon that was that was us

1959
02:14:42.64 --> 02:14:47.20
So we had to build a good relationship with like the local populist in a very short amount of time

1960
02:14:47.20 --> 02:14:49.92
Um, we had to build a relationship with our interpreter

1961
02:14:50.80 --> 02:14:56.32
And that's really honestly when it boils onto it our lives dependent on these relationships because at times

1962
02:14:56.88 --> 02:14:59.28
You're asking some of these people to risk their lives for you

1963
02:15:00.24 --> 02:15:04.96
And so that's where I really started delving into how do I get people to trust and

1964
02:15:05.20 --> 02:15:08.56
Like me to the point where I can influence them in the shortest amount of time

1965
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:13.04
That's really the biggest lesson I got out of those two years from doing that that mission set

1966
02:15:13.20 --> 02:15:14.000
Yeah

1967
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:20.72
Well, that's and that's something that applies across the board. You know that's funny when you're talking about the switch going off in your head of like oh

1968
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:24.88
I can use this that's the same thing that happened that's what started all this stuff

1969
02:15:24.88 --> 02:15:27.52
I went and talked to these freaking executives about leadership

1970
02:15:27.84 --> 02:15:33.60
They started asking me questions and I was just applying the principles the four laws combat take ownership

1971
02:15:33.60 --> 02:15:38.32
Like that's what I started and it was 30 it was the first question I got asked. I was like oh

1972
02:15:39.20 --> 02:15:43.20
Oh, you have this problem. Okay. Here's how you solve it just based on the principles that we already know

1973
02:15:43.20 --> 02:15:45.20
Yeah, it's like a freaking

1974
02:15:46.40 --> 02:15:49.20
Such a nice moment in my life. I was like oh

1975
02:15:49.44 --> 02:15:52.72
Because I did again. I think I was totally in search of the institutionized

1976
02:15:52.72 --> 02:15:56.32
I didn't understand I didn't know anything about civilian companies

1977
02:15:56.32 --> 02:16:02.48
I didn't know anything up at all about them and all of a sudden I realized in an instant that oh all this stuff applies

1978
02:16:03.20 --> 02:16:08.40
To all these leadership situations man and that's the same thing going back to building relationships

1979
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:16.16
Like oh yeah guess what have you ever had a moment in your life where having an antagonistic relationship with someone you got to work with helps

1980
02:16:16.56 --> 02:16:20.32
It's like that that that that doesn't ever happen anybody ever never happened where oh

1981
02:16:20.32 --> 02:16:25.28
I don't get along with this person and I have to work with and it's beneficial to me doesn't happen

1982
02:16:25.44 --> 02:16:27.44
So why are you not focused on

1983
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.84
Getting to build relationships with people it's freaking crazy but good lessons

1984
02:16:31.84 --> 02:16:39.04
Um you come back from that and you go back to trade it again, right? Yeah, I go back to trade it as the exo this time

1985
02:16:39.92 --> 02:16:43.28
Exo trade it. Yeah, what are you are you will you attend it now?

1986
02:16:43.76 --> 02:16:50.24
I'm a jail still or jj a jg yeah, yeah, yeah, because I did my so I because I didn't have to go through bugs

1987
02:16:50.24 --> 02:16:55.60
Everything else. I did my first deployment as an instant. Yeah, and so you know I'm a jg now and

1988
02:16:55.60 --> 02:17:01.36
And because I'm prior and listen and I knew the CEO there at the time who's most so prior and let's say guy

1989
02:17:01.36 --> 02:17:03.36
Cause actually him and I had done a deployment

1990
02:17:03.36 --> 02:17:05.36
So they we'd done that I racked the planet together

1991
02:17:05.36 --> 02:17:08.24
Okay, at team one and he was like yeah come on over

1992
02:17:08.64 --> 02:17:12.24
I was like you know I I need to do a disassociated tour

1993
02:17:12.88 --> 02:17:17.76
Is there like you need to because I was like hey can I go back and do my platoon commander? Yeah, and they're like no

1994
02:17:18.08 --> 02:17:23.12
They're like you need to get away from it for a little bit because you know they have like a limit on how much time you could be deployed

1995
02:17:23.12 --> 02:17:28.40
Mmm and they're like dude you're like right there you need to you need to go somewhere and take a knee

1996
02:17:28.40 --> 02:17:33.76
So I'm like trade it sounds good. I really like I really enjoyed my time there and so I decided to go back

1997
02:17:34.16 --> 02:17:39.94
And then you're doing the exo billet, which is not quite as fun as doing that. It's not definitely not as fun as being

1998
02:17:39.94 --> 02:17:45.60
Not what I thought it was gonna be so the CEO actually gets the funer job for sure because he's actually

1999
02:17:45.60 --> 02:17:50.48
Going to the training trips and debriefing as the exo you're dealing with

2000
02:17:50.48 --> 02:17:56.96
Yeah, everything else and the admin stuff the disciplinary problems getting on the the meetings at group

2001
02:17:57.52 --> 02:18:02.32
Yeah, yeah, you're I'm man my career was such a freaking

2002
02:18:03.44 --> 02:18:07.88
I was just so lucky at everything like when I was just the death of the L. I see you know

2003
02:18:07.88 --> 02:18:11.60
So just getting just going out and training trips and freaking awesome this

2004
02:18:12.56 --> 02:18:17.60
What point so how many years do you have in at this point? This is like 2018 so you're coming up on 20

2005
02:18:17.60 --> 02:18:22.000
Yeah, this is when you start thinking about maybe doing something else

2006
02:18:22.56 --> 02:18:27.52
Yeah, so I mean I figured I had the time so I'm like, I'm gonna go knock out my MBA

2007
02:18:27.52 --> 02:18:31.36
I always really enjoyed business and then through conversations

2008
02:18:31.36 --> 02:18:35.04
They were like hey after this they were like you can't do your your

2009
02:18:36.24 --> 02:18:43.08
Oh, I see until I 20 24 something like that. I'm like what am I gonna do until then?

2010
02:18:43.08 --> 02:18:45.08
Like you do more dissociated tours

2011
02:18:45.08 --> 02:18:48.76
And I'm like you know what that doesn't sound interesting to me

2012
02:18:48.76 --> 02:18:52.84
So I think I'm just gonna retire. I mean at that point I was gonna hit 20

2013
02:18:53.96 --> 02:18:56.52
So I'm like you know what I'm gonna go get my MBA and

2014
02:18:57.56 --> 02:18:58.84
And punch out

2015
02:18:58.84 --> 02:19:04.28
entire so that's at that point where I started looking into MBA programs and and trying to see where I was gonna go

2016
02:19:04.28 --> 02:19:09.96
And you're gonna go back to USD no, right now. I went to UCLA. Oh, you went to UCLA

2017
02:19:10.12 --> 02:19:12.36
Yeah, yeah, it was funny about that

2018
02:19:12.36 --> 02:19:17.48
I was really set on like getting an M7 school. You know like the magazine seven

2019
02:19:17.48 --> 02:19:23.88
So like I'm only gonna go to like war and her boo-ther MIT or one of those and so those are the only ones

2020
02:19:23.88 --> 02:19:26.52
I applied to and I realized that the GI bill doesn't cover

2021
02:19:27.24 --> 02:19:29.24
those because they're private schools

2022
02:19:30.44 --> 02:19:36.76
Even though like some of them actually had lower tuition than UCLA and at that point I had a really good friend of mine

2023
02:19:36.76 --> 02:19:41.80
Well, my best friends if you look at his resume. It looks almost exactly like mine like FMF Corman

2024
02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.76
You know teams USD finance degree and then he's like hey, bro

2025
02:19:46.76 --> 02:19:49.88
I'm actually gonna go to UCLA and I'm like why is that?

2026
02:19:50.52 --> 02:19:54.28
And then he's like dude, dude, GI bill pays for it because it's a public school

2027
02:19:55.32 --> 02:20:00.44
And I struggled with that for a little bit. I built as a cover private schools. It only covers like a small portion

2028
02:20:00.44 --> 02:20:02.84
I was still gonna have to take out like a six figure

2029
02:20:02.84 --> 02:20:09.32
Just a six figure student loan and I've always been pretty frugal about my money on my day

2030
02:20:09.32 --> 02:20:15.24
I don't want to take out this huge loan and then I kind of went into thought I'm like why do I want to go to one of these schools

2031
02:20:15.96 --> 02:20:17.56
Like why do I really want to go?

2032
02:20:17.56 --> 02:20:19.96
And at some point I realize I just want people to think I'm smart

2033
02:20:21.80 --> 02:20:26.76
I mean, we really like you know bullet down on this most simple phone. I just want people to think I'm smart

2034
02:20:26.76 --> 02:20:28.52
I'm like you know what I think I have enough

2035
02:20:28.52 --> 02:20:32.20
To get to where I want to go if I go to UCLA

2036
02:20:32.92 --> 02:20:40.12
So I would drive up to LA every weekend to go to school there and knock out my MBA and then from there you

2037
02:20:41.08 --> 02:20:45.64
You want to invest my banking right? Yeah, yeah, so I knew that I you know like way

2038
02:20:45.64 --> 02:20:48.76
What do you what do you do after an MBA like everybody does investment banking or

2039
02:20:49.88 --> 02:20:51.88
Consulting and

2040
02:20:51.88 --> 02:20:56.36
I always really liked finance and then my my buddy. I was so about cowboy

2041
02:20:56.36 --> 02:21:00.84
I'm going to tell you we got exact same resumes like do I'm going to go be an investment banker?

2042
02:21:00.84 --> 02:21:03.32
I'm like cool. I'm gonna go be an investment banker too

2043
02:21:04.92 --> 02:21:09.56
So is he like a year ahead of years? No, we're in the same class, but he actually knew how to do it

2044
02:21:09.56 --> 02:21:14.84
So he actually got in so there's a cycle to it and I didn't know that so when you first get to your MBA program

2045
02:21:14.84 --> 02:21:17.80
Literally the second you step on campus you're already recruiting for it

2046
02:21:18.04 --> 02:21:24.28
You're already recruiting for the the internship for that summer and then you go to your second year and after you graduate

2047
02:21:24.28 --> 02:21:29.48
Second year you start full time however by a time I figured it all out. I was already at my second year

2048
02:21:29.48 --> 02:21:31.48
So I was a year behind and

2049
02:21:31.48 --> 02:21:34.68
So nobody really wanted to deal with me because it wasn't the traditional path

2050
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:42.12
So I just started reaching out to people on LinkedIn like sending them my resume and I would put in like whatever bank

2051
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.36
US like I would put Air Force Veteran Marine Corps Veteran

2052
02:21:46.68 --> 02:21:49.16
I'm like dude if anybody's gonna answer me it's gonna be a veteran god

2053
02:21:49.16 --> 02:21:55.24
And that's how I started getting in was a veteran from these banks they would start reaching out. You only saw my resume

2054
02:21:55.24 --> 02:21:57.24
Like I think they were intrigued

2055
02:21:57.80 --> 02:22:00.84
Obviously the Navy seal park kind of stands out. I'm not gonna lie

2056
02:22:00.84 --> 02:22:03.24
I just that's definitely what got my foot in the door because

2057
02:22:03.48 --> 02:22:06.92
Some of these other people it's an extremely competitive job and some of these people

2058
02:22:07.64 --> 02:22:12.36
A waste martyr them me and be had like a legitimate pedigree in the finance world

2059
02:22:13.64 --> 02:22:14.92
And so

2060
02:22:14.92 --> 02:22:20.28
Meanwhile you were exo straight ahead. Yeah, so I told my wife. Good point man

2061
02:22:20.84 --> 02:22:24.92
Yeah, yeah, I told my wife I'm like dude when I go to these meet and greets because it's like a million meet and greets

2062
02:22:25.48 --> 02:22:28.68
Because it's extremely competitive. I'm telling it's it's so competitive

2063
02:22:30.28 --> 02:22:34.60
And especially in LA because in LA there's a lot less slot like if you go in New York

2064
02:22:34.60 --> 02:22:38.84
There's a ton of slots in your everybody wants to be a warm weather so everybody's like trying to apply to go to LA

2065
02:22:39.96 --> 02:22:43.000
And I told my wife I'm like when I go to these meet and greets like all these people

2066
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
They're just ridiculously smart

2067
02:22:45.24 --> 02:22:52.28
How's it like it's pretty intimidating and then we had this one interview process where they actually take you in with your other competitors

2068
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.28
So it's like you and two other people that you're competing with and then you go and you interview with these bankers

2069
02:22:58.28 --> 02:23:04.36
And these these interviews were like three hours long like you would do half an hour with this banker and then half an hour with this banker

2070
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:09.80
And that's when I realized that I belong there that I could that I had a shot

2071
02:23:09.80 --> 02:23:15.48
Because the very first that that interview process wasn't technical at all. It was all about leadership

2072
02:23:16.68 --> 02:23:20.60
So when they start coming up with these questions like tell me about a time

2073
02:23:21.32 --> 02:23:27.08
Where this happened. I'm like cool. I have a story for that. I have a story for everything and

2074
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.40
It was cool because I would tell my story and then the guy next to me will tell his story and it literally got to the point

2075
02:23:35.40 --> 02:23:41.88
Where I'm not in kidding you and in the interview the guy next to me was like I really hate going after him

2076
02:23:42.60 --> 02:23:44.60
What am I supposed to say after that?

2077
02:23:47.16 --> 02:23:52.60
So that's what I'm like oh I got a shot and you ended up getting hard. Yeah, I ended up getting the internship

2078
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.80
So the internships like you know nine weeks long. It's basically like a nine week interview

2079
02:23:58.60 --> 02:24:04.68
It was legit like you're you're working your ass off grind. Yeah, it's a grind

2080
02:24:04.68 --> 02:24:09.64
And then you had another year of school the complete no because I had actually started my second year

2081
02:24:09.64 --> 02:24:17.72
It's so I so you got so your internship went right into job. Yeah, and that was actually one of the the the things were I

2082
02:24:17.72 --> 02:24:21.88
Use you finish school when you're in which you finish school when you're in still in yeah

2083
02:24:22.84 --> 02:24:25.56
And then when did you do that nine week internship did you leave

2084
02:24:26.68 --> 02:24:29.40
Damn yeah, I was already on my way out. Yeah, it was like

2085
02:24:29.40 --> 02:24:36.68
So like getting close to terminal even whenever exactly I said saved all my leaves specifically for for you know

2086
02:24:36.68 --> 02:24:43.48
Me getting out got it and so I used it all well up then and I got hired and they let me start right away because

2087
02:24:44.12 --> 02:24:46.12
You know I didn't have another year of school

2088
02:24:46.52 --> 02:24:48.12
So

2089
02:24:48.12 --> 02:24:52.44
And then retired and then how do you like how do you like the investment banking world?

2090
02:24:52.44 --> 02:24:59.40
I like I liked a lot of it and I didn't like other parts of it

2091
02:25:00.28 --> 02:25:02.04
I really liked the mergers and acquisitions

2092
02:25:02.04 --> 02:25:08.12
So that's what we did we did mergers acquisitions and then leverage buyouts and we were dealing with big because I got hired with a big bold

2093
02:25:08.12 --> 02:25:13.56
Bracket banks were working on like some big deals and it was exciting it was cool was interesting

2094
02:25:14.28 --> 02:25:17.48
It just wasn't cool for 18 to 20 hours a day

2095
02:25:17.48 --> 02:25:24.04
Like I worked long days it was like an early night was midnight

2096
02:25:24.68 --> 02:25:29.24
But most of the times on you know I'm building power points and Excel models till three four in the morning

2097
02:25:29.32 --> 02:25:35.48
Those times where I didn't sleep at all like our presentation was do it like 5 a.m. and I turned it in at 5 a.m

2098
02:25:36.20 --> 02:25:42.12
Where were you working out of so home because it was pretty good yeah, so I didn't have to move up to LA

2099
02:25:42.52 --> 02:25:44.52
Which is good because my wife didn't want to move up there

2100
02:25:44.52 --> 02:25:47.88
But we were set on moving up there and but it was

2101
02:25:49.40 --> 02:25:56.12
Every time we drove up there to look at places the drive home would be very quiet because we could just tell that neither of us wanted to move up there

2102
02:25:57.16 --> 02:26:02.68
But it worked out for me because like I said it was COVID so they're like hey we're gonna be virtual you know for the time being

2103
02:26:04.04 --> 02:26:05.40
And

2104
02:26:05.40 --> 02:26:11.80
And I think when I realized like I don't want to do this long term is when I saw the managing directors have been there for a while like I would finish the presentation

2105
02:26:11.80 --> 02:26:14.12
You know and it's like four in the morning like how you need to call them?

2106
02:26:14.68 --> 02:26:17.32
I'm like it's four in the morning like you need to call a managing director

2107
02:26:17.88 --> 02:26:22.36
To me T.S. to look over that PowerPoint for we turn it in and I'm like dang so I guess it's never stops

2108
02:26:23.24 --> 02:26:27.08
And it was and I had to had a couple T.B. eyes throughout my career

2109
02:26:27.88 --> 02:26:31.96
So my my green because I wasn't there was literally nice where I won't go sleep at all

2110
02:26:32.28 --> 02:26:33.88
I'd roll right into the next day and and

2111
02:26:34.12 --> 02:26:40.28
My greens were starting to get more frequent and staring at a screen like all day long and I'm like this isn't gonna be

2112
02:26:40.28 --> 02:26:43.24
A long term play for me, but I'm gonna tough it out

2113
02:26:45.32 --> 02:26:51.48
You know for the two or three years or whatever you gotta be to make VP and then move on some else and I didn't realize that the job offers

2114
02:26:51.48 --> 02:26:53.48
We're gonna start rolling in so quickly

2115
02:26:53.72 --> 02:26:58.84
So like once the job offers like recruiters started reaching out to me. I'm like I'm gonna start looking elsewhere

2116
02:26:59.80 --> 02:27:04.68
And around that time is you know J.P. had been talking to me about echelon front now for

2117
02:27:04.68 --> 02:27:11.64
For about a year like even when I was in trade-a he's like hey you thought about coming over here and and I was I was interested but I just never materialized

2118
02:27:12.12 --> 02:27:13.32
You know

2119
02:27:13.32 --> 02:27:19.000
And I just went down my path I told him. Hey J.P. this is actually what I'm doing now and I'm kind of all in on it and

2120
02:27:20.04 --> 02:27:24.28
So it's around that time. I'm already looking at moving to different firms

2121
02:27:24.28 --> 02:27:26.68
I've already got a couple that I'm pretty close to

2122
02:27:26.84 --> 02:27:30.60
to signing with and and then J.P. calls me one day and he's like hey bro

2123
02:27:30.60 --> 02:27:37.08
We have a client who you know about 50% of his employee speaks Spanish and I told him we could deliver

2124
02:27:39.08 --> 02:27:41.08
I was like you did

2125
02:27:41.08 --> 02:27:43.08
He's like well yeah I got you

2126
02:27:43.08 --> 02:27:45.08
Because he knew I was fluent in Spanish and

2127
02:27:45.72 --> 02:27:48.28
I was like bro you ever seen office space?

2128
02:27:48.84 --> 02:27:51.56
I was like that's my life. I have seven bosses Bob

2129
02:27:52.28 --> 02:27:55.96
You know so you're all I'm on seven different deals and for each deal. I have to get

2130
02:27:56.52 --> 02:27:59.16
approved I mean they granted some of them are are you know

2131
02:27:59.16 --> 02:28:03.88
have some spill over so there's a minute I'm working with you know managing director for two or three different deals

2132
02:28:03.88 --> 02:28:08.84
So I'm like dude it's gonna be so hard for me to get a day off like it's gonna be near impossible

2133
02:28:09.64 --> 02:28:11.32
And he's like bro I really need this

2134
02:28:12.04 --> 02:28:13.88
I'm like all right you know

2135
02:28:14.76 --> 02:28:18.68
And J.P. is one of my brothers like I love J.P. to death so I'm like let me see what I can do

2136
02:28:19.24 --> 02:28:23.56
So I put in the time for two personal days and by the way a personal day

2137
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:27.96
It's funny when you get the email that says this is what a personal day looks like you will check your email

2138
02:28:27.96 --> 02:28:31.48
You know like six times during that day and if you need something you will answer it so it's

2139
02:28:31.88 --> 02:28:33.88
Really like a personal day so freaking working

2140
02:28:34.76 --> 02:28:39.000
So I'm like I took two personal days to come out and help them out with this FTX and

2141
02:28:40.76 --> 02:28:44.52
So I would literally you know teach all day long and then I pulled an all-nighter

2142
02:28:44.68 --> 02:28:50.28
Trying to catch up on all the work that I missed throughout the day so I didn't sleep for like those three days that I was there

2143
02:28:50.28 --> 02:28:58.36
Um, but it was cool because I showed up and it was this construction company and when I showed up

2144
02:28:59.16 --> 02:29:04.92
I could tell that that some of the guys weren't happy to be there and not because they're you know lazy

2145
02:29:04.92 --> 02:29:06.68
Anything that they just wanted to go to work

2146
02:29:07.16 --> 02:29:11.72
They're hardworking people you know so they're like they want to be working instead of being in this

2147
02:29:12.28 --> 02:29:14.28
Leadership course and

2148
02:29:14.76 --> 02:29:17.16
So let's see I think I think it was a Thursday

2149
02:29:17.16 --> 02:29:22.12
Yeah, I was a Thursday where the first day of class started and we split the class in two because they

2150
02:29:22.12 --> 02:29:26.60
Had so many people that we were gonna teach one class one day and then the other group that's next day and on Saturday

2151
02:29:26.60 --> 02:29:29.16
We did like a debrief tying it all back into their business

2152
02:29:29.56 --> 02:29:34.04
So day one I'm teaching I could see it that you know they'd rather be working than be there

2153
02:29:34.76 --> 02:29:38.44
One of their form and who you know it's like one of their rock star form and shows up late

2154
02:29:39.24 --> 02:29:44.52
Like same thing. He's like man, I'd rather be working right now. You know, I'll be there and then at the end of the day

2155
02:29:44.52 --> 02:29:49.88
I I noticed the switch like they I could tell that they were enjoying themselves and they

2156
02:29:49.88 --> 02:29:55.80
They were learning stuff and it was clicking the light bulbs were coming on and at the end of the day this form and he comes on to me

2157
02:29:55.80 --> 02:30:00.20
He's like hey man, I'm really sorry that I showed up late. Can I come back tomorrow and do it all over again?

2158
02:30:00.68 --> 02:30:04.68
I was like it's fine with us as long as your boss is cool with it and he's like okay

2159
02:30:05.32 --> 02:30:07.32
So he comes back the next day

2160
02:30:07.32 --> 02:30:11.08
You know and and does the full day of training with echelon front and

2161
02:30:11.08 --> 02:30:13.08
And

2162
02:30:13.08 --> 02:30:15.08
on the third day

2163
02:30:15.08 --> 02:30:17.08
when I

2164
02:30:17.64 --> 02:30:22.84
Herd the debrief points and the impact that I made. I mean some of these debrief points there do it was like emotional

2165
02:30:24.12 --> 02:30:29.000
Like it was like shit and I was like wow like you guys are doing something really great here

2166
02:30:29.96 --> 02:30:31.96
Um, and I felt good about it

2167
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:34.28
You know their CEO was just

2168
02:30:35.32 --> 02:30:39.64
Just cared so much it's super super intelligent guy very caring very humble

2169
02:30:39.64 --> 02:30:46.36
And it was just a pleasure talking to him and and seeing how much he cared about his team and his people and then seeing

2170
02:30:46.92 --> 02:30:52.28
How these other people appreciated now really start to appreciate the fact that he did this for them

2171
02:30:52.28 --> 02:30:55.96
Like was trying to develop them as leaders because he cared about them. He cared about the company

2172
02:30:57.24 --> 02:30:59.88
And I told J.P. I'm like man that felt good

2173
02:31:01.32 --> 02:31:07.48
I haven't felt good about what I was doing for work for for a while since I left the teams and

2174
02:31:07.48 --> 02:31:09.96
Um, and that's when I was like okay

2175
02:31:10.60 --> 02:31:14.84
Let's have a serious conversation of what this could possibly look like for me joining EF

2176
02:31:16.52 --> 02:31:18.76
So here you are you know that that little

2177
02:31:19.88 --> 02:31:20.92
The little

2178
02:31:20.92 --> 02:31:27.48
obstacle that you get over with and I obviously I've been doing this for a long time now

2179
02:31:28.20 --> 02:31:33.24
But there's a little obstacle with some people when they show up for training and the obstacle is

2180
02:31:33.24 --> 02:31:40.28
Well, there's there can be several of them but one of the biggest obstacles is they don't yet understand that

2181
02:31:40.84 --> 02:31:42.84
Leadership is a skill

2182
02:31:43.48 --> 02:31:49.24
And that it's something that they use and it's something that they can actually learn and get good at

2183
02:31:49.64 --> 02:31:55.80
And it doesn't take very long in those sessions where people go oh wait that's me. Oh wait. I could use that

2184
02:31:56.60 --> 02:31:58.60
And all of a sudden they realize

2185
02:31:58.60 --> 02:32:05.80
This is gonna make my life so much better and it's gonna make my team's life so much better and that

2186
02:32:06.28 --> 02:32:10.52
That is so gratifying to see that and what's really awesome is

2187
02:32:11.32 --> 02:32:18.84
When you look up in three months six months or a year and now you see where that company is and they they're trajectory that

2188
02:32:19.24 --> 02:32:23.08
That changes for a company and how they elevate and move forward

2189
02:32:23.08 --> 02:32:30.20
Man, it's freaking it's very very rewarding to say the least yeah every time I do another job

2190
02:32:30.20 --> 02:32:33.24
I'm just just solidifies that decision for sure

2191
02:32:33.72 --> 02:32:35.72
It's weird where you thinking

2192
02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:43.48
Because because the first gigs that you did was teaching FTX which is like our fuel training exercise which is

2193
02:32:45.24 --> 02:32:51.000
You know, I'm JP and I've talked about this where I'm like a HAP people don't they don't need to really like know how to

2194
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:58.76
Clear room yeah, it's just it's funny almost the human instincts that you have of how you would clear a room are good enough

2195
02:32:59.48 --> 02:33:05.000
To do the FTXs. It's not about teaching people how you know the tactics of combat

2196
02:33:05.24 --> 02:33:08.84
It's just about teaching them leadership, but it's funny

2197
02:33:09.56 --> 02:33:12.20
Even the plans they come up with like we give them a target

2198
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:16.76
Their plans are like perfectly fine. They're perfectly fine. Yeah, no

2199
02:33:16.76 --> 02:33:22.04
Sometimes they're not that great sometimes they make mistakes, but a lot of times it's like, yeah, you know what that's that would work

2200
02:33:22.04 --> 02:33:25.80
That would work on this target for real and these are people that are civilians because

2201
02:33:26.60 --> 02:33:30.84
Let's face it hitting a target of bad guys. There's it's not rocket science

2202
02:33:31.16 --> 02:33:35.48
It's not rocket science to figure out what you're gonna do and we give them enough basics that they can figure it out

2203
02:33:35.80 --> 02:33:36.84
but

2204
02:33:37.08 --> 02:33:38.04
For me

2205
02:33:38.04 --> 02:33:43.72
You know the the leadership laboratory that we got to work in we were actually in and actually a trade it and actually seeing

2206
02:33:43.72 --> 02:33:47.000
Patoons go through that is such a powerful thing because

2207
02:33:47.72 --> 02:33:49.72
Man when you are in those situations

2208
02:33:50.44 --> 02:33:55.72
You feel it and when you like you think all I'm good at detaching and then you go on a run where you're freaking

2209
02:33:56.20 --> 02:33:58.84
Yellow and screaming and you you know and you're saying oh

2210
02:33:59.08 --> 02:34:00.84
How was that detachment on the last run?

2211
02:34:00.84 --> 02:34:06.28
Yeah, as you were yelling and screaming at everybody and shooting your weapon a bunch and not and no one took charge of anything

2212
02:34:06.52 --> 02:34:08.12
So obvious

2213
02:34:08.12 --> 02:34:12.68
When you actually experience it and you learn that lesson so much more thoroughly

2214
02:34:12.68 --> 02:34:17.08
When you actually experience it's freaking awesome to watch. Yeah, absolutely

2215
02:34:17.08 --> 02:34:20.60
I've had messages like on on Instagram or LinkedIn

2216
02:34:21.48 --> 02:34:23.08
Where people have gone through our training

2217
02:34:23.08 --> 02:34:28.12
It's like hey, I had this situation at work and I thought about that time when you took the gun away from me and told me to lead

2218
02:34:28.36 --> 02:34:31.32
You know because when they're not detached and they're just getting after it with their gun

2219
02:34:31.32 --> 02:34:34.92
But they're actually in charge like every now and then I'll take their gun away

2220
02:34:35.32 --> 02:34:40.04
Like hey lead now you can lead you know how they're gun and and so you know

2221
02:34:40.04 --> 02:34:46.28
They'll right back like I remember the time you did this to me or you said this to me and and I say that at at that FTX is on my K

2222
02:34:46.68 --> 02:34:47.96
You know

2223
02:34:47.96 --> 02:34:49.96
Going through that pain

2224
02:34:50.68 --> 02:34:56.60
Actually solidifies that lesson way more and it's like Bruce Lee says the pain will leave you when it's done teaching you

2225
02:34:57.48 --> 02:34:59.48
One of my favorite quotes

2226
02:34:59.48 --> 02:35:03.64
And I tell people that too like in my brief in the morning on my hate. We're not here to teach you leadership

2227
02:35:03.64 --> 02:35:08.20
I mean, we're not here to teach you tactics. We're here to teach you leadership and in the absence of knowledge

2228
02:35:08.20 --> 02:35:11.80
Because you don't have any you know knowledge doing this. What do you have to lean back on your leadership?

2229
02:35:11.80 --> 02:35:16.28
Which is simply you trying to influence another 25 people towards a common goal

2230
02:35:16.92 --> 02:35:25.40
So you're gonna have to use all those tools that we've you know talked about and the the groups that do the best or the ones that are able to apply it immediately like they make that

2231
02:35:25.56 --> 02:35:29.16
Connection and the ones that struggle are the ones that that you know

2232
02:35:30.12 --> 02:35:33.16
Can't seem to do that. You know what's interesting. I was just thinking about this

2233
02:35:33.16 --> 02:35:40.12
From a GG to perspective how long you've been training GG for since 2012. I know lots of off

2234
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:49.40
So so what's interesting is you know people like you take a normal dude and you say hey what did that doesn't train

2235
02:35:49.96 --> 02:35:55.48
And you think hey if you get in a fight what would you do they kind of like they kind of think what is it that the hey?

2236
02:35:55.72 --> 02:35:57.72
I just see red bro

2237
02:35:57.72 --> 02:36:02.04
You know I go off bro like that's kind of what they think they think that that is

2238
02:36:02.04 --> 02:36:07.000
How they're gonna fight and that's how they would win in a fight like hey. I'll just freaking make it happen

2239
02:36:08.04 --> 02:36:14.44
And that's totally ignorant that's one of the most ignorant things you could say and if you go against someone that's trained then you're absolutely gonna lose

2240
02:36:14.44 --> 02:36:16.44
But there's also a really good chance to lose anyways

2241
02:36:17.72 --> 02:36:24.92
Imagine this there's people that that are in leadership positions that their mentality is that exact same thing

2242
02:36:24.92 --> 02:36:30.04
Hey, oh if I'm in charge of tell people to all handle it and and they could literally learn

2243
02:36:30.04 --> 02:36:35.64
Judges who for leadership we have jujitsu for leadership it's like an amazing

2244
02:36:36.36 --> 02:36:43.08
Untapped knowledge that like the graces the graces brought you to the world and all of a sudden people like oh

2245
02:36:43.08 --> 02:36:46.12
I can choke people I don't I can defeat to someone that's bigger than me

2246
02:36:46.36 --> 02:36:51.72
I can avoid getting hit like there's all these amazing things that we literally did not know as humans

2247
02:36:52.04 --> 02:36:56.12
We did not know and if you were to go out and a fight and if I would have gotten no fight in

2248
02:36:56.12 --> 02:37:00.36
in 1990 or 1991 I

2249
02:37:00.92 --> 02:37:10.60
Would do what my instincts are throw haymakers whatever like whatever it is a human is gonna do is what I would do and then all of a sudden as soon as I learn

2250
02:37:10.60 --> 02:37:12.60
Oh the joke

2251
02:37:12.60 --> 02:37:19.32
Like all of a sudden you know what to do and now you can handle all these situations and it's the same thing with what we teach it's like oh

2252
02:37:19.48 --> 02:37:20.84
This isn't some

2253
02:37:20.84 --> 02:37:26.84
This isn't some mysterious thing like here. Oh, this is an arm walk it's called cover-in move here's

2254
02:37:27.24 --> 02:37:35.24
Taking the back this is keeping things simple you can actually learn maneuvers for leadership and that's what hits people when they're

2255
02:37:35.56 --> 02:37:38.92
Going through our programs you can see it in the face they're like oh

2256
02:37:39.64 --> 02:37:45.32
I remember when a guy was doing this to me and all I had to do back was was

2257
02:37:45.32 --> 02:37:51.16
To manage you know how to meet reflect and diminish I could have taken that angry person and

2258
02:37:52.68 --> 02:37:57.88
Reflected some of those emotions but diminish them and then I could reflect it in such a way that they would

2259
02:37:57.96 --> 02:38:01.48
Realize that I'm on their side and then we'd be able to have a real conversation to move this important

2260
02:38:01.64 --> 02:38:03.000
That's one move

2261
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:09.32
There's all these moves you can learn and man. It's just like this. You know what it's actually the same look when somebody does

2262
02:38:09.32 --> 02:38:14.68
You jits you and whatever moment because different people get it at different time that moment where they go oh

2263
02:38:15.32 --> 02:38:20.28
This is amazing like oh it all makes sense. I think it's sometimes when people realize that

2264
02:38:21.32 --> 02:38:26.04
You know oh and then you sweep them and you're in the mountain and they go oh

2265
02:38:26.20 --> 02:38:30.28
It all connected you see that look in the rise and I see that look in the eyes

2266
02:38:30.28 --> 02:38:33.16
That's what you're talking about like the guy that you're talking about that came back the end of the day like

2267
02:38:33.24 --> 02:38:34.76
Hey, can I come tomorrow?

2268
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:41.96
Because he realized that it's all connected that leadership is a skill that he could actually utilize these tools to go out there and

2269
02:38:42.52 --> 02:38:48.28
Lead his team with with skills and with techniques and with procedures moves

2270
02:38:49.08 --> 02:38:51.48
Man, it's freaking empowering

2271
02:38:52.52 --> 02:38:53.72
legit

2272
02:38:53.72 --> 02:38:55.08
Um

2273
02:38:55.08 --> 02:38:58.28
And that's where you're at right now. Yeah, we just went through your whole damn life bro

2274
02:38:58.28 --> 02:39:06.44
Yep, that that's pretty impressive. We'll have to uh, I know there's a I know you had some some stuff that you wrote down for me

2275
02:39:06.44 --> 02:39:12.20
That we didn't cover today that we'll probably cover cover on the next time as didn't you know get a little bit more granular

2276
02:39:12.20 --> 02:39:14.20
And some of these things that you experience for sure

2277
02:39:14.76 --> 02:39:17.24
But probably a pretty good place to wrap it up

2278
02:39:17.96 --> 02:39:23.24
Of course echo probably has some questions at this point. Oh, you got what a question oh, yeah, keep it simple

2279
02:39:23.80 --> 02:39:26.28
Have you ever heard that you look like Oscar Delahoya?

2280
02:39:26.28 --> 02:39:28.76
Every day of my life since I was 16

2281
02:39:30.04 --> 02:39:35.16
As a matter of fact and my platoon's they already knew it was coming and so when we would go out

2282
02:39:35.72 --> 02:39:39.24
Like you know people would be like hey is that and they're like you

2283
02:39:39.80 --> 02:39:43.32
Yeah, we're security yeah, that's what they would say and

2284
02:39:44.20 --> 02:39:49.000
Just not not too long goes in New York and I was with my wife and this guy comes out to me

2285
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.64
He's like hey man, I still think pound for pound you're the best

2286
02:39:51.64 --> 02:39:57.40
And then she's like are you gonna correct him and I'm like I'm tired of correcting people but then it's like more people

2287
02:39:57.40 --> 02:39:59.16
Start coming up like hey guys. I'm not Oscar

2288
02:39:59.72 --> 02:40:01.72
The buff version

2289
02:40:01.72 --> 02:40:06.76
Scrilla was jacked version the jack version. I've gotten that forever

2290
02:40:07.48 --> 02:40:09.48
Yeah, that is an uncanny resemblance

2291
02:40:10.44 --> 02:40:13.80
All right, yeah, who do you look like echo Charles? Jade?

2292
02:40:14.92 --> 02:40:18.76
Too easy though you even asked that one before that was too easy

2293
02:40:19.24 --> 02:40:21.08
Got that twin brother. Oh, yeah

2294
02:40:21.08 --> 02:40:24.60
Man like I said we'll dig into some more of this stuff in the future probably could place a wrap it today

2295
02:40:26.92 --> 02:40:33.40
That goes Charles yes sir sounds like it kind of seems like Carlos has gotten a lot done

2296
02:40:34.28 --> 02:40:39.88
Yes, he has I'm thinking maybe we should all do more what do you think what do we start?

2297
02:40:40.28 --> 02:40:44.28
Well, you mentioned you get to what a good place to start. Yes, sir

2298
02:40:45.16 --> 02:40:48.12
Yeah, we want to what do you a purple belt yeah purple belt

2299
02:40:48.12 --> 02:40:55.24
2012 it's 21.9 year when do you get a purple? just recently yeah, but often on that's yeah

2300
02:40:55.24 --> 02:40:59.24
I was on deployment a lot and and then I would bounce around a couple of schools and

2301
02:40:59.88 --> 02:41:03.24
I'm training actually with your buddy Aaron Hernandez. Oh, right on to he's awesome

2302
02:41:03.24 --> 02:41:10.04
Frick and awesome. Yes, yeah, he's he's awesome. You know like I started he started training that when we were at Fabio Santos

2303
02:41:10.04 --> 02:41:14.28
He was like yeah, you're so yeah, I want to see those pictures bro

2304
02:41:14.68 --> 02:41:16.68
That's freaking rad. What yeah

2305
02:41:16.68 --> 02:41:20.28
He's awesome man his dad like would just come out

2306
02:41:20.28 --> 02:41:25.88
Is a lot of times nowadays you see like the dads all ended you did too and that's why the kids are there

2307
02:41:26.04 --> 02:41:28.04
Yeah, almost against their will

2308
02:41:28.04 --> 02:41:32.36
It didn't seem like Aaron's dad was into it, but he's like oh, this is what my kid wants to cool

2309
02:41:32.36 --> 02:41:37.56
I'm gonna sit here every day, you know for two hours on the bench waiting for my kid to get done with this

2310
02:41:37.56 --> 02:41:42.76
Whatever this weird stuff is that he's doing. Yeah, it's freaking legit so what's that?

2311
02:41:42.76 --> 02:41:44.76
2012

2312
02:41:44.76 --> 02:41:46.76
To your almost ten years deep

2313
02:41:47.56 --> 02:41:49.32
Got that purple belt under a

2314
02:41:49.32 --> 02:41:53.40
Improble that happens yeah, so yeah, even life was like that too, right?

2315
02:41:53.56 --> 02:41:57.32
Dude, life was a white belt, but I started training

2316
02:41:58.04 --> 02:42:03.000
Those guys in 2005, but actually he had trained before that

2317
02:42:03.56 --> 02:42:05.56
Lafet trained at Fabios

2318
02:42:06.12 --> 02:42:11.84
Before 2005 so life was like white belt for I mean

2319
02:42:11.84 --> 02:42:14.48
Yeah, I was like you should say no, I

2320
02:42:15.76 --> 02:42:19.44
Long time long time long time. That was perfectly happy at blue belt

2321
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:25.76
Yeah, Aaron was like bro. I got he got it. You got it. Do it to you. Yeah, blue belt is the

2322
02:42:26.40 --> 02:42:30.88
Blue belt is the last chance you have to be under the radar. Yeah, because once you're a purple belt

2323
02:42:30.88 --> 02:42:33.52
But people expect you there's a yeah you

2324
02:42:34.40 --> 02:42:39.52
You can get tapped you can literally get tapped by a white belt as a blue belt and it's not that big of a deal right

2325
02:42:39.52 --> 02:42:44.48
You're kind of like well, you know, I'm just a blue belt just to blue belt it covers a lot of ground

2326
02:42:44.56 --> 02:42:46.56
I was a blue belt for a long time too

2327
02:42:46.56 --> 02:42:48.32
I was a blue belt because I was a blue belt

2328
02:42:48.32 --> 02:42:52.80
I got my blue belt and San Diego, but then I moved to Virginia Beach and I mean dude, and I was training

2329
02:42:53.36 --> 02:42:56.16
When I was in San Diego training all the time and then when I got to Virginia Beach

2330
02:42:56.16 --> 02:42:58.72
I did a couple of appointments so I wasn't training that's much but even I was on deployment

2331
02:42:58.72 --> 02:43:00.16
I would train with the boys

2332
02:43:01.04 --> 02:43:04.80
But I was still a blue belt so it was years. I think I was a blue belt for like I

2333
02:43:05.20 --> 02:43:08.08
Wanted and then when I got back to San Diego

2334
02:43:08.08 --> 02:43:11.28
So, you know, I had to like re-earn my

2335
02:43:12.24 --> 02:43:16.88
Risp it was like I it was like when I wasn't at Fabios he's I wasn't training

2336
02:43:17.12 --> 02:43:20.88
He's like whatever and I'm the way you were you might have gotten better, but it didn't count

2337
02:43:21.44 --> 02:43:24.24
We're starting where you left off. Yeah, we started where I left off with him

2338
02:43:25.60 --> 02:43:27.60
So it took me another

2339
02:43:27.92 --> 02:43:31.60
Another probably I think I was a blue belt like five years

2340
02:43:32.80 --> 02:43:34.80
Blue belt and I

2341
02:43:34.80 --> 02:43:39.04
I never buy my wife anything like hardly ever poor woman

2342
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:42.24
But when I got my purple belt when I got my purple belt

2343
02:43:42.64 --> 02:43:45.92
I got up I went to a flower store. I got a purple flower

2344
02:43:46.56 --> 02:43:52.56
Of some kind or like five purple flowers and brodma that's I was so stoked that I wanted my wife to be

2345
02:43:52.56 --> 02:43:57.92
Got a stoked to get that purple belt but and and I was ready for it too like I mean

2346
02:43:58.72 --> 02:44:00.96
When I got my purple balls ready for that purple belt

2347
02:44:00.96 --> 02:44:04.96
I had somebody got their black belt the other day friend of mine got a black belt the other day

2348
02:44:05.04 --> 02:44:09.92
He's not ready for it. I was like no one feels like they're ready for their black belt no almost no one right?

2349
02:44:09.92 --> 02:44:11.92
Maybe you just won worlds or whatever

2350
02:44:12.96 --> 02:44:16.64
But you're not just like oh yeah, I forget who it was. I think might have been Clark

2351
02:44:17.52 --> 02:44:20.08
greasy I think I could be wrong so whenever

2352
02:44:20.80 --> 02:44:25.92
But it was a kind of where he was winning everything as a brown belt everything and

2353
02:44:26.48 --> 02:44:30.32
I think he was like I don't know if it was a coach or whatever someone was kind of like oh

2354
02:44:30.32 --> 02:44:34.56
Wait is he doing that just so he can win a bunch and

2355
02:44:34.96 --> 02:44:40.08
Someone was like bro like he can't compete as a brown belt anymore. It's like someone has to give it

2356
02:44:40.08 --> 02:44:45.76
Black belt like that's that's the only exception I could ever think of yeah well Dean list one ADCC is a brown belt

2357
02:44:46.64 --> 02:44:51.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but via submission by the way absolutely by the way

2358
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:59.76
I'm doing so so we're thinking to Jets is good. Yes, it Jets is good fitness is good Carlos in great shape

2359
02:45:00.32 --> 02:45:06.80
You know, no, it's good to see if so we got some healthy how should I say healthy we want to go in a healthy direction

2360
02:45:06.96 --> 02:45:10.80
Mentally physically same so I'm gonna talk about energy drinks first

2361
02:45:11.44 --> 02:45:12.64
Cuz that's you know

2362
02:45:12.64 --> 02:45:17.84
Kind of what we do from time to time so we got jocco discipline go energy drink healthy energy drink

2363
02:45:17.84 --> 02:45:22.56
By the way, if you didn't know Carlos and did those things power the FTXs. I know

2364
02:45:25.60 --> 02:45:30.80
Like a soft ball what he called rhetorical kind of question because I know I know you know, but the the the the

2365
02:45:30.80 --> 02:45:32.80
Discipline goes scenarios

2366
02:45:32.80 --> 02:45:39.84
So yes, so yeah, we will drink energy drinks though as long as this kind yeah, yeah for sure because the other kind

2367
02:45:40.64 --> 02:45:41.84
Bad is bad

2368
02:45:41.84 --> 02:45:44.96
It's it's a dichotomy well this kind

2369
02:45:44.96 --> 02:45:49.20
Completely bad for you legitimately bad for you and this isn't like oh well

2370
02:45:49.60 --> 02:45:54.32
Jocco's trying to sell his energy drink no, I'm telling you those other energyings are

2371
02:45:54.96 --> 02:46:02.000
factually bad for you. We have one that is factually good for you. Yes, sir. Factually you know that there's a

2372
02:46:02.56 --> 02:46:04.40
I don't know the service but you can do it online

2373
02:46:04.40 --> 02:46:12.48
I was gonna do it for a video. I was gonna make long time ago before all this where you can make your own energy drink like if you want oh

2374
02:46:12.48 --> 02:46:19.52
You know Carlos extra thunder energy drink or whatever and you can kind of pick a flavor and then like

2375
02:46:20.08 --> 02:46:23.44
They'll design the thing or you could design the thing and then you just get it

2376
02:46:23.44 --> 02:46:27.28
But it's all like the similar like if you want cherry blast or whatever

2377
02:46:27.28 --> 02:46:32.96
I don't know what you call it, but if you get like a cherry flavored one it's like the same cherry flavored as like you know

2378
02:46:33.20 --> 02:46:35.20
Jocco cherry blast

2379
02:46:35.20 --> 02:46:37.20
I would do lemon lime lows

2380
02:46:38.40 --> 02:46:39.36
You know it's interesting

2381
02:46:39.36 --> 02:46:46.16
You might think yourself good because you did the investment banking thing for a while and did you guys take any companies public

2382
02:46:46.64 --> 02:46:48.64
You so actually during my internship

2383
02:46:48.64 --> 02:46:54.16
I don't like you it's interesting because we work with a bunch of public companies obviously

2384
02:46:54.72 --> 02:46:59.04
But you might think to yourself like hey, well, why does everyone just make you know a

2385
02:46:59.04 --> 02:47:02.16
Guad energy drink that's good for you. You think that right like hey

2386
02:47:02.16 --> 02:47:04.16
Well, that just seems like that seems like a good idea

2387
02:47:05.20 --> 02:47:06.96
And here's the deal

2388
02:47:06.96 --> 02:47:08.96
It's more expensive

2389
02:47:08.96 --> 02:47:15.92
It's more expensive and it's gonna cut into your profit and as soon as you get into a point in a company where you're like oh

2390
02:47:17.60 --> 02:47:23.36
We want to do the right thing and make the best product and we are not gonna make as much money

2391
02:47:23.60 --> 02:47:25.60
There's like

2392
02:47:25.60 --> 02:47:33.76
armies of people that tear you apart and say no just freaking make more money. It's the same thing with you know with our hard goods with our clothing

2393
02:47:33.76 --> 02:47:38.56
Yeah, as soon as you get to a point oh you where you can make jeans. Oh, we're making jeans

2394
02:47:39.44 --> 02:47:41.20
As soon as some of those hey we could shave

2395
02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.72
48 cents off the price per pair of those jeans. Oh, yeah, there's an army of people that say do it

2396
02:47:49.12 --> 02:47:53.28
They sell they say sell your soul. That's what they say and it works

2397
02:47:53.28 --> 02:47:58.32
Of course it I mean it works think about it too. Especially the more you sell right where okay

2398
02:47:58.32 --> 02:48:04.40
I'm gonna do this. Oh, we're gonna shave 48 cents when you're selling like 10 pair or 10 whatever it's like 40 cents

2399
02:48:04.40 --> 02:48:06.08
It's like what four dollars in front

2400
02:48:06.40 --> 02:48:12.32
I'd rather keep my hand bigger. Yeah, but once the numbers start going way up there in 48 cents means like another like

2401
02:48:12.32 --> 02:48:14.96
I don't know half a million dollars for you or whatever

2402
02:48:14.96 --> 02:48:16.96
Yeah, oh, I think that 48 cents

2403
02:48:16.96 --> 02:48:25.60
You know so it's a literal selling of the soul literal selling of the soul man because like this is pasteurized right

2404
02:48:25.60 --> 02:48:31.92
Which means we not to put chemicals in it which by the way this is chemicals that everybody uses they all throw them in there

2405
02:48:31.92 --> 02:48:37.76
Hey, there's not that bad right right it's not that bad. Yeah. Yeah. Sell yourself. We'll say industry standard

2406
02:48:37.76 --> 02:48:40.48
Yeah, it's the industry standard. You kind of shred your shoulders

2407
02:48:40.48 --> 02:48:45.92
But well, you know, that's the way everyone's doing it. Well, there's certain like toxins right where like the FDA is like well

2408
02:48:45.92 --> 02:48:47.92
You just keep them below this level and

2409
02:48:48.56 --> 02:48:50.96
Technically it's like it's legal or whatever

2410
02:48:50.96 --> 02:48:52.96
It's like consider not

2411
02:48:52.96 --> 02:48:56.72
harmful whatever or if they pound like three of those every day

2412
02:48:57.04 --> 02:48:59.04
That's crazy big trouble

2413
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:06.96
Big trouble now the last now with these obviously it's good. So yeah get on some of that that'll help us you know move you in the right direction

2414
02:49:06.96 --> 02:49:12.000
Yes, sir stay fit and mentally because the cognitive stuff and there as well also

2415
02:49:12.88 --> 02:49:18.000
Keep your joints in in the game as well, you know if you still if you want to work out as you get older

2416
02:49:18.88 --> 02:49:20.56
You don't you love staying

2417
02:49:20.56 --> 02:49:24.72
No, do you live today I did yeah, well time you live what time do you

2418
02:49:24.72 --> 02:49:25.68
We're good

2419
02:49:25.68 --> 02:49:26.72
It's not 430

2420
02:49:27.28 --> 02:49:29.04
It's I saw today I got up at 6

2421
02:49:29.76 --> 02:49:31.76
What'd you do

2422
02:49:31.76 --> 02:49:36.24
Just like don't not do but like roughly what'd you do pull ups do you what'd you do

2423
02:49:36.24 --> 02:49:38.000
Tuesdays like day. Yeah me too

2424
02:49:38.40 --> 02:49:40.40
Let me just happen to be this is a Sunday

2425
02:49:40.40 --> 02:49:43.44
Yeah, but here's what's cool. I got done. I was just

2426
02:49:44.16 --> 02:49:48.72
But my son opened the door to my garage and I could you know feel his presence there

2427
02:49:48.72 --> 02:49:54.48
And only he's wanted to jacksteel himself and I racked away squats

2428
02:49:55.04 --> 02:50:00.32
Racked away turn around and he goes how many more you got and I go I'm done because I was literally done and he goes

2429
02:50:00.72 --> 02:50:02.72
Ways are good at the pier and I go

2430
02:50:02.72 --> 02:50:04.72
Let's hit it

2431
02:50:04.72 --> 02:50:10.32
Is it cold right now kind of cold it's California it's California meaning it's not gonna freeze

2432
02:50:10.56 --> 02:50:14.56
But it's not gonna be warm either are we using a wet suit? I used the wetsuit today

2433
02:50:14.56 --> 02:50:20.16
A warm weakness weakness no no efficiency look do you want to enjoy surfing you know what enjoy surfing

2434
02:50:21.04 --> 02:50:25.20
You know the weird thing is frankly if you go surfing without a wetsuit

2435
02:50:25.28 --> 02:50:27.28
It's only cold for the first

2436
02:50:27.28 --> 02:50:33.68
Most days I mean if sure that's freezing but most days it's only cold for three minutes and then it's just normal and you feel fine

2437
02:50:34.08 --> 02:50:35.68
Those three minutes though

2438
02:50:35.68 --> 02:50:38.64
That's what puts feet that's what has people squeezing in that damn wetsuit

2439
02:50:38.64 --> 02:50:44.24
Yeah, and also when you're in the cold water they like your handle and maybe for

2440
02:50:45.12 --> 02:50:51.92
Like an eye me they depends who you are obviously but after like an hour it's almost like the coldness like you get hit with that initial coldness and your body's like

2441
02:50:51.92 --> 02:50:55.20
I'm not that cold actually so we're cool plus you're generating heat from all the stuff

2442
02:50:55.20 --> 02:51:00.88
But then the coldness kind of on a strategic level starts to just see pin yeah, and it kind of hits and you like probably I'm kind of this

2443
02:51:01.44 --> 02:51:07.20
It's kind of what is it big factor you surf crows now? I don't here's a big factor if you're gonna be catching a lot of waves

2444
02:51:07.20 --> 02:51:09.60
And there's good waves coming in you're gonna be fine

2445
02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.32
But if it's one of those days we're gonna be waiting and there's a little brisk breeze at your back

2446
02:51:14.72 --> 02:51:16.72
You're gonna get chilly woo

2447
02:51:18.08 --> 02:51:22.40
You're gonna get chilly woo factors with that because one you're not having fun

2448
02:51:22.40 --> 02:51:26.80
You know like well, you do it like you actually don't even notice a lot of stuff when you're having like fun

2449
02:51:26.80 --> 02:51:31.20
You don't notice how tired you're getting you don't know that notice a lot of stuff colds probably one of those when you're you know

2450
02:51:31.20 --> 02:51:38.40
And then you're moving way less yeah, and then you're just sitting there just being cold. Yes, there's there be cold

2451
02:51:38.40 --> 02:51:41.60
There there's a let's face it. That's kind of legit

2452
02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
You know when I when I see someone scanning it

2453
02:51:44.72 --> 02:51:48.24
Like props you get into I'm giving you props if you're scanning it you're getting props

2454
02:51:48.24 --> 02:51:52.96
Maybe it's the dead of summer, but any other time if it's not

2455
02:51:53.68 --> 02:51:57.76
If it's not all-guest and you're scanning it

2456
02:51:57.76 --> 02:52:03.36
I give you a little bit of a little bit of and it's sometimes myself too. Yeah, you know what we're gonna do it

2457
02:52:04.08 --> 02:52:06.08
Let's skin

2458
02:52:06.08 --> 02:52:11.20
Because when you go through buds did you have wet suits that had like legs connected to him when you went through buds?

2459
02:52:12.64 --> 02:52:16.96
No, I don't think so we just had shorties oh no, I have like beaver tail

2460
02:52:17.36 --> 02:52:21.44
Oh, so that's what we had at first recon bat time okay for tails so when I got the buds

2461
02:52:21.44 --> 02:52:25.28
I'm like they think of these students better what's it to be caught at what's beaver tail

2462
02:52:25.28 --> 02:52:33.92
It's like you're the back of the wet suit has like a long tail on it and it comes up underneath your crotch and like snaps into position

2463
02:52:34.24 --> 02:52:39.84
And fun of you it does nothing to hold in any water at all. It's the dumbest invention ever

2464
02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:44.80
Whoever invented the beaver tail is an idiot you would never come up with that plan right?

2465
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:52.64
So because but now they have where the the the shirt of the wet suit is connected to the trunk

2466
02:52:52.64 --> 02:52:58.16
Which is a whole different ballgame this is a whole different ballgame. This is a totally different situation

2467
02:52:58.16 --> 02:53:01.44
And they get that in buds by the way you got that in buds

2468
02:53:02.32 --> 02:53:04.80
I don't think I've ever worn a wet suit ever

2469
02:53:05.36 --> 02:53:07.36
I can't remember one single time

2470
02:53:08.08 --> 02:53:10.08
That's the way it is no light

2471
02:53:11.36 --> 02:53:13.36
Shredding

2472
02:53:13.76 --> 02:53:15.36
Anyway, back to our joints

2473
02:53:15.92 --> 02:53:19.28
We don't we don't want to have joint problems. That's another thing cold lot is good for you

2474
02:53:19.28 --> 02:53:26.24
And it's by the way that's where you got to get in that bath yeah, but if you're not gonna jump in ice bath as often as maybe you could

2475
02:53:26.32 --> 02:53:31.44
You just keep the what's called joint warfare super krill oil supple me just take this up on it

2476
02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.96
So you don't easy way so you don't got to freeze yourself vitamin D

2477
02:53:36.24 --> 02:53:41.60
Take vitamin D 100% take that every day. Yeah, my god cold war

2478
02:53:42.56 --> 02:53:44.56
Keep the immunity strong

2479
02:53:44.56 --> 02:53:50.56
You get all this stuff from jockelfuel.com get some milk to because let's face it man

2480
02:53:51.60 --> 02:53:54.72
Let's face it that's a tough one. It's a tough one to not

2481
02:53:55.20 --> 02:53:58.88
Bro, did you see that did you I posted some stakes I had the other day. Yes, I saw that

2482
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:03.44
That's amazing. Yeah people people semi stakes

2483
02:54:04.40 --> 02:54:10.48
Which is like the only like yeah people semi stakes those were from they were you know jack on them

2484
02:54:10.48 --> 02:54:17.12
Jack yeah, he's a barbecue yeah, he sent those

2485
02:54:18.64 --> 02:54:24.16
He's just the ones that he always could I think it's but maybe I don't know they're cow k

2486
02:54:24.16 --> 02:54:28.32
W. Yeah, they were good. They were good. Yeah, they were so good

2487
02:54:29.04 --> 02:54:33.60
Even when I got done eating those even when I got done eating a freaking full on

2488
02:54:33.60 --> 02:54:40.48
Tomahawk steak. I was like cool guess what I wanted a little bit of sweetness

2489
02:54:41.04 --> 02:54:43.36
Goodness a little bit what's that other word?

2490
02:54:44.80 --> 02:54:46.16
It's like

2491
02:54:46.16 --> 02:54:51.12
Savory Savory is like steak, right? Yeah, like saltier with it right and then sweet

2492
02:54:51.76 --> 02:54:53.76
What's mok it's got both

2493
02:54:53.76 --> 02:55:03.20
Well, if you think about it the real good desserts the flavors have like little bit us like save or like a little bit us

2494
02:55:03.20 --> 02:55:08.72
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then if you think about it like the good like savory has a little bit of sweet too

2495
02:55:08.72 --> 02:55:13.92
And you think about it so what about mok basically it's hot mok season by the way

2496
02:55:13.92 --> 02:55:18.32
It's like there's having a hot mok in the morning

2497
02:55:18.32 --> 02:55:24.88
Oh, man. I'm not talking early morning like pre workout. I'm talking nine o'clock in the morning

2498
02:55:25.52 --> 02:55:30.64
Starting to feel a little bit of hunger. It's a little bit cool outside hot mok coming at you live

2499
02:55:31.36 --> 02:55:34.24
Do I throw whipped cream on top of that I do

2500
02:55:35.76 --> 02:55:40.56
That's still pale. Oh, well, yeah, actually a lot of whipped cream well, I don't know a lot

2501
02:55:40.56 --> 02:55:45.20
But the one that my wife buys is actually not that bad for it. It's actually pretty solid

2502
02:55:45.20 --> 02:55:47.92
I'm surprised by that keep it a real with that keto

2503
02:55:49.92 --> 02:55:53.36
Check the gizelle's a mok too. That's clean protein though by the way

2504
02:55:53.36 --> 02:55:58.64
We don't really mention that because it like sometimes we're back in the day or whenever you didn't take mok

2505
02:55:58.64 --> 02:56:00.16
You take protein shake you got the

2506
02:56:00.72 --> 02:56:06.32
Let's face it like you get some secondary effects. You know from that not the kind this facts you weren't negative

2507
02:56:07.76 --> 02:56:09.28
But that's not like that anymore

2508
02:56:09.28 --> 02:56:13.76
But yeah, is that and then also jocquate tea the old school feel like tea hot tea now obviously

2509
02:56:13.76 --> 02:56:17.52
And if you like dead left thing by the way. Yeah, sir. You don't want that job. It's the one

2510
02:56:18.24 --> 02:56:22.72
Yeah, get it all at jockelfuel.com also the energy drink you already said

2511
02:56:22.72 --> 02:56:26.72
Right by the way, I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this or not yet, but we got

2512
02:56:27.68 --> 02:56:31.92
We got some ready to drink mok coming oh yeah, and

2513
02:56:32.96 --> 02:56:34.96
Let's just say

2514
02:56:34.96 --> 02:56:41.36
I'm not saying that the creators that the creators deserve a Nobel Prize

2515
02:56:41.36 --> 02:56:47.28
I'm not saying that it's definite, but they should be in the content should they should be mentioned there should be a mentioned

2516
02:56:47.84 --> 02:56:49.84
When you try these things

2517
02:56:49.84 --> 02:56:52.24
Yeah, so you're gonna be able to in the future

2518
02:56:52.56 --> 02:56:59.52
Going to a wall-wop boom go restrate and just get mok on tap or like and actually that makes sense when you think about it because it's not like

2519
02:57:00.08 --> 02:57:02.96
When you think about what if you spend anytime thinking about it

2520
02:57:04.24 --> 02:57:09.04
Maybe I do maybe I don't I don't know but either way it's like you can't just because mok is the powder right

2521
02:57:09.04 --> 02:57:16.80
Then you have your mix like you know we'll put in the banana we'll put in the whatever right and it's like this variations of mixes and variations of results

2522
02:57:16.96 --> 02:57:18.32
And it makes sense

2523
02:57:18.32 --> 02:57:23.70
So it's like hey if you're gonna drink the ready to drink one you got to commit to a very specific mix across the board

2524
02:57:23.70 --> 02:57:26.96
Yeah, per flavor. You seem saying so now you got to rely on whoever

2525
02:57:27.52 --> 02:57:33.52
Expert I know there in expert. I'll tell you that you ever had something coming to your life that you just just came out of nowhere

2526
02:57:34.48 --> 02:57:37.52
Like you couldn't have predicted it. Oh, yeah, let me tell you something

2527
02:57:37.52 --> 02:57:44.96
Yeah, salted caramel. I didn't even know what this this does not in my world never in my world this idea

2528
02:57:45.44 --> 02:57:48.16
Salted caramel. What is this like what is this?

2529
02:57:48.72 --> 02:57:51.20
We have a salted caramel verse

2530
02:57:52.08 --> 02:57:57.44
I'm actually familiar with the salted caramel so that one to me that makes sense that sounds delicious all right

2531
02:57:57.44 --> 02:58:03.36
So there we go. There you go. Oh, come also get it also origin USA. This is American made stuff

2537
02:58:35.04 --> 02:58:37.04
because

2538
02:58:37.04 --> 02:58:44.08
You know what you were talking about you know you were talking about it earlier Carlos, you know seeing people these people are hard workers and

2539
02:58:44.56 --> 02:58:49.20
The first time you worked with an echelon front client like man these people are working hard

2540
02:58:49.20 --> 02:58:53.92
They want to do a good job and that's awesome. That's that's so

2541
02:58:53.92 --> 02:59:01.44
Awesome that we get to experience all these people across the country, but then there's the industries and there's corporations that say you know what

2542
02:59:02.32 --> 02:59:03.92
To hell with those people

2543
02:59:03.92 --> 02:59:09.20
To hell with those hard working people we're gonna offshore this stuff. We're gonna put it into slave labor camps

2544
02:59:09.36 --> 02:59:11.36
We're gonna give money to communists. That's what we're doing

2545
02:59:12.40 --> 02:59:14.40
That's what we're doing that's

2546
02:59:15.60 --> 02:59:19.28
That's what we're doing we're gonna we're gonna have slave people

2547
02:59:19.28 --> 02:59:26.96
Build this stuff and we're gonna give money to communist regimes. That's what we'll do how's that sound and that kind of goes along with that 48 cents like

2548
02:59:26.96 --> 02:59:32.32
You know what you're trying to get that's what drives it. Yeah, don't let that don't let that happen

2572
03:01:06.88 --> 03:01:13.84
So there's it there's a kind of a jujitsu section. Yes, how many shirts are in the jujitsu section right now just that one

2573
03:01:15.84 --> 03:01:21.52
Section but it's a break out area yeah, but when Dean's shirt comes out

2574
03:01:21.52 --> 03:01:25.12
Yeah, will it's gonna say foot right just like yours is good

2575
03:01:25.52 --> 03:01:29.76
Says foot actually that's his technically that's his design right I just

2576
03:01:29.76 --> 03:01:34.72
Sticker someone put a sticker on the gym out here and it's got it's got leg and old nom

2577
03:01:34.72 --> 03:01:44.64
Picture of a dude with like a steel pot helmet on in nom American, but it's Dean Lister's face and it says foot soldier

2578
03:01:46.56 --> 03:01:49.28
See we might have to have a Dean Lister section

2579
03:01:49.28 --> 03:01:53.92
Dean with the feet and Dean and that whole thing sure so there you go, but yeah

2580
03:01:54.48 --> 03:01:59.52
Good spot to get this stuff talk with store where the like I said discipline could see them jiu-jitsu stuff

2581
03:01:59.52 --> 03:02:06.16
Good, it's a good one. You want to star me navy game. Yeah, it's face it good goes deep. We'll say that

2582
03:02:06.72 --> 03:02:13.76
We did we did appreciate that and it kind of worked for navy or was this yes? Apparently in the assessment fully

2583
03:02:14.16 --> 03:02:18.64
Seems like it worked out good. So speak for themselves. But yeah, also we have the shirt locker

2584
03:02:18.64 --> 03:02:20.64
Which is the new shirt every month

2585
03:02:21.04 --> 03:02:25.20
They're separate from the regular store, but it's a new shirt. They're a little bit more creative

2586
03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:27.52
Good good feedback on now

2587
03:02:27.52 --> 03:02:29.52
Got things square the way too by the way

2588
03:02:29.84 --> 03:02:34.56
We got one coming out too right there should be anyone coming out pretty soon. Yeah, so if I'm not sure

2589
03:02:34.56 --> 03:02:39.76

2590
03:02:39.76 --> 03:02:44.64
You know before it was like okay, I joined then the next month your shirt kind of comes but it's all squared and right away

2624
03:05:23.20 --> 03:05:30.32
How they'll solve the issue and it's unique to that specific thing so it's like okay, you can kind of it's like a demonstration

2625
03:05:30.48 --> 03:05:32.48

03:06:45.92 --> 03:06:51.20
Again, we're not very pretty when less predictable possibly than you know some people might think

2646
03:06:52.16 --> 03:06:54.16
Leadership strategy and tactics field manual

Get these freaking books for the kids. This is a Christmas season get there's no better gift you can get a kid than these books

2652
03:07:21.36 --> 03:07:25.04
That's a that's a bold statement Carlos do you think that's a bold statement?

2653
03:07:26.16 --> 03:07:30.88
No better no better gift. I would have to agree. I grew up with books love books

2654
03:07:30.88 --> 03:07:38.24
I don't think there's don't read enough these days. I don't think there's a better gift you can give a kid than the way the warrior kid books

2655
03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:46.000
And I got many many many kids and parents that will back that up that aren't me

2656
03:07:48.72 --> 03:07:50.72
Mike in the dragons you can also get that for the little kids

2657
03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:53.20
Warning

2658
03:07:53.20 --> 03:07:55.52
Little warning when you read that to your kids

2659
03:07:56.16 --> 03:07:58.72
You might start crying. It's happened before echo Charles

2660
03:07:58.72 --> 03:08:04.08
No, that was where the warrior kid won oh really uncle Jake one in okay when I was making the video

2661
03:08:04.08 --> 03:08:06.08
Yeah a little bit for making the dragon

2662
03:08:11.36 --> 03:08:17.20
Way to work kid when uncle takes spoiler alert by the way one uncle Jake had to win home

2663
03:08:18.32 --> 03:08:20.88
I was gonna say dude. I was laughing

2664
03:08:21.68 --> 03:08:25.28
When I read that one story you were crying like really hard

2665
03:08:25.28 --> 03:08:28.24
I'm crying that's the thing

2666
03:08:28.24 --> 03:08:32.56
He edited it down. He put you at it's the park us. I'm like now we never yet

2667
03:08:32.88 --> 03:08:36.000
He edited it down. I didn't realize it until later because he was

2668
03:08:36.56 --> 03:08:39.36
Right and couldn't put a sentence to do that and then I'm

2669
03:08:40.24 --> 03:08:44.08
I started laughing so hard. I'm like bro you can't break down like this

2670
03:08:45.04 --> 03:08:48.64
He's talking about he started on a whole I five over he's breaking down

2671
03:08:48.64 --> 03:08:51.28
It was a sad scene is what it was like or a happy soon

2672
03:08:51.28 --> 03:08:56.88
So warning Mike in the dragons Mike catch you off guard if you're feeling emotionally vulnerable

2673
03:08:57.60 --> 03:09:02.80
Then you might catch you a little bit so just you know stay strong stay focused don't let you so break down

2674
03:09:03.92 --> 03:09:07.52
About face by hack worth extreme ownership and that I caught a few leadership

2675
03:09:08.88 --> 03:09:11.52
That actually helped your marriage that attitude

2676
03:09:12.88 --> 03:09:17.68
Take your ownership of that. I'll be back to read the book again put in a different way because the first time I read it

2677
03:09:17.68 --> 03:09:22.08
I was like okay, I want to be a better leader in combat so that's kind of like the vision I had when I was reading it

2678
03:09:22.08 --> 03:09:23.60
And then the second time I'm like

2679
03:09:23.60 --> 03:09:27.84
I made I'm gonna read it for my life my personal life. Yeah, yeah, that's a good

2680
03:09:27.84 --> 03:09:33.60
With lens it's such a useful switch where like because that's a big thing right where it's like oh

2681
03:09:33.60 --> 03:09:38.16
Yeah, these big bad Navy seals. They're gonna tell me how to run my daycare center like bro no way

2682
03:09:38.72 --> 03:09:41.68
In real life no way but it's like just like yes

2683
03:09:41.68 --> 03:09:46.16
Yeah, exactly right where it's like the Navy see like all the combat stuff

2684
03:09:46.16 --> 03:09:50.48
That's just the example essentially it's just an example of these principles like

2685
03:09:51.28 --> 03:09:53.28
Being used in these like

2686
03:09:53.28 --> 03:09:56.96
situations or whatever but and since they they are useful and everything

2687
03:09:57.60 --> 03:10:03.92
If you look at it in the sense of word this is they're talking to me for my specific situation and using the

2688
03:10:03.92 --> 03:10:08.48
The battlefield doesn't matter for for sure, but they're talking to me for me for my specific situation

2689
03:10:08.48 --> 03:10:13.92
It's like oh shoot everything checks out. Yeah, and as you read things from different perspectives

2690
03:10:13.92 --> 03:10:17.92
Like yeah, you can read it from a professional perspective like you did the first time Carlos

2691
03:10:18.56 --> 03:10:22.32
Then you read it from a person perspective the next time but then guess what happens you get promoted

2692
03:10:23.20 --> 03:10:25.60
Read it again. You see it from another perspective again

2693
03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.48
Then you have a problem what you get moved to a new team and everything's a dynamic are different

2694
03:10:30.48 --> 03:10:35.76
Read it again. It's a you will have a different perspective and you will pick up more things from those books

2695
03:10:36.48 --> 03:10:37.84
Also

2696
03:10:37.84 --> 03:10:44.80
We have a leadership consultancy. We were just talking about national on front. National on front dot com if you want to do any of the things that we talk about on this podcast

2697
03:10:44.80 --> 03:10:49.04
If you want to learn to the information go to national on front dot com. So what we do we

2698
03:10:50.32 --> 03:10:53.52
Do look we do the FTX that's one part of it. We also do

2699
03:10:54.40 --> 03:10:58.72
Leadership training that's not experiential so you're gonna sit down learn with us

2700
03:10:58.72 --> 03:11:04.64
But we'll still make it dynamic through role playing and other other methodologies that we have so

2701
03:11:04.64 --> 03:11:10.24
If you want to check some of that out go to national on front dot com. You haven't found there Carlos. Oh, yeah

2702
03:11:11.12 --> 03:11:17.44
It's awesome. I mean the people that you meet are just amazing as well because I mean people that call for extreme ownership are not

2703
03:11:17.92 --> 03:11:19.20
lazy people

2704
03:11:19.20 --> 03:11:22.96
People who just want to take it to the next level so I honestly have a meta client yet that I just

2705
03:11:23.60 --> 03:11:28.000
Didn't really like and I bet it's awesome because you keep in touch with them like they hit you up every now and then and

2706
03:11:28.80 --> 03:11:30.80
They come to your friends

2707
03:11:30.80 --> 03:11:36.56
For sure I get text all the times I get text from that are like hey, we just did this it's awesome

2708
03:11:36.56 --> 03:11:40.64
I'll also get text like hey can I talk to you and they'll have some situation going on and it's like all right

2709
03:11:40.64 --> 03:11:44.72
What do you got? What do you got? Let's work through this hey we also have an online

2710
03:11:45.44 --> 03:11:47.44
training academy and

2711
03:11:48.24 --> 03:11:52.56
There's a bunch of reasons why we started that the biggest reason why we started is because

2712
03:11:53.28 --> 03:11:55.28
like I was saying earlier about

2713
03:11:55.28 --> 03:12:01.04
Juditsu and actually having a skill and getting good at this thing called leadership

2714
03:12:02.64 --> 03:12:06.48
Well just like you jitsu you can't go to one class and be like, oh, okay cool. I'm good now

2715
03:12:06.48 --> 03:12:10.80
I know it no it takes repetition it takes understanding the various angles

2716
03:12:11.12 --> 03:12:17.84
It takes expanded knowledge it takes confronting different scenarios multiple times so you understand how to understand them

2717
03:12:19.68 --> 03:12:22.88
You've heard to understand how to understand them

2718
03:12:22.88 --> 03:12:25.84
Imagine that you're looking at a situation

2719
03:12:26.96 --> 03:12:31.84
You don't know what to do you can actually understand how to understand that

2720
03:12:32.88 --> 03:12:38.16
So this doesn't happen overnight. That's why that's why we made extreme ownership dot com and

2721
03:12:38.72 --> 03:12:40.72
The online training academy

2722
03:12:41.44 --> 03:12:45.12
We're on there all the time there's courses that you can take you can go live sessions

2723
03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:51.32
I'm on there two or three times a week answering questions face to face like on a zoom call

Yeah, it's what he how they know what you like it's like how my heart is getting this yeah the whole algorithm thing

2746
03:14:36.64 --> 03:14:43.20
Like the algorithm thing I wrote the other fight the algorithm but the problem is when the jitz who video start rolling it's hard to fight that

2747
03:14:43.20 --> 03:14:48.08
I was like when we watch that again, bro kind of embrace the algorithm in a way in a way

2748

And LinkedIn you're on LinkedIn yeah, I am on LinkedIn. Yeah, is that do you

2749
03:14:56.08 --> 03:14:59.52
You like participate in LinkedIn because you mentioned it a few times today

2750
03:15:00.56 --> 03:15:02.40
So I had it when I when I was

2751
03:15:02.64 --> 03:15:06.88
Getting ready to transition out of the TV because that's how I started reaching out to people so yeah, I have one of those two

2752
03:15:07.44 --> 03:15:12.000
I have LinkedIn too. Yeah, me too. So we're on there echo you got any final questions

2753
03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
That's it. Oh actually

2754
03:15:14.80 --> 03:15:20.24
So do you think and I think this may seem like an obvious answer, but more so

2755
03:15:20.56 --> 03:15:26.56
Okay, so when you were growing up, you know, I had it so many chores like it was like hard right like so you got used to hard work really

2756
03:15:27.52 --> 03:15:29.52
Quickly and thoroughly essentially

2757
03:15:30.40 --> 03:15:36.64
Could you feel that like as you know you go through like you know hard things and combat buds like all these hard things or whatever

2758
03:15:36.64 --> 03:15:41.04
And because you said you said something kind of interesting where you're like okay on the third time after you got rolled

2759
03:15:41.04 --> 03:15:46.72
or whatever third time you passed with no no issues you said a lot of people like buds is like real hard for them

2760
03:15:47.20 --> 03:15:50.56
Did you feel that your work ethic that was established

2761
03:15:52.08 --> 03:15:57.04
Like was the factor that made it like a non-issue like could you feel that at the time?

2762
03:15:58.24 --> 03:16:00.24
Yeah, absolutely

2763
03:16:00.24 --> 03:16:04.08
You know it was crazy. I thought about my my stepdad a lot during whole week

2764
03:16:04.64 --> 03:16:09.44
Because I thought about how hard he worked. I mean, I mean man worked non-stop seven days a week two jobs

2765
03:16:09.44 --> 03:16:14.32
And I was going through hell we got thought about him. I was like you know what he can do that. I could do this right

2766
03:16:14.32 --> 03:16:17.76
Yes, I want to provide for myself and my family like

2767
03:16:18.40 --> 03:16:23.28
Yeah, yeah, that's what was thinking when you're saying that also it kind of makes you reflect like

2768
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:28.72
You reflect on like something like your childhood then I think man. I should give my kids more chores

2769
03:16:29.84 --> 03:16:34.64
You know what's so weird about buds is you just never know who's gonna make it through you really don't

2770
03:16:34.64 --> 03:16:41.36
And there's some silver spoon people that go through there and crush it and there's some silver spoon people that wash out day two

2771
03:16:41.36 --> 03:16:47.52
And there's some freaking kids that grew up wherever in a shitty situation working their ass off and they quit

2772
03:16:47.52 --> 03:16:50.96
Yeah, and there's some kids like that that are awesome. It's so bizarre

2773
03:16:52.48 --> 03:16:55.12
It's very bizarre it's very hard to predict there is some

2774
03:16:56.56 --> 03:16:58.56
Like some oh

2775
03:16:58.56 --> 03:17:03.04
If the guy like they say if I'm someone wrestle that's a really good thing because you have to work really hard

2776
03:17:03.04 --> 03:17:07.68
And wrestling that's a that's like an indicator, but it's by no means oh he wrestled

2777
03:17:07.84 --> 03:17:15.76
He's gonna make it not at all not at all not even close. Yes, one of the many factors might be a little nudge in the direction of

2778
03:17:17.04 --> 03:17:19.04
But it's no guarantee

2779
03:17:19.04 --> 03:17:22.88
That's it. No, I'm good to good to see you again. Yeah, like well. Thank you for having me

2780
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:25.60

2793
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:22.08

The world's gonna carry on without us that's the reality it would be arrogant to think otherwise

2806
03:19:14.22 --> 03:19:17.50
