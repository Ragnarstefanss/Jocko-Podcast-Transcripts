00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jockel Podcast number 290 with echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:06.36
Dr. Willink. Good evening echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:14.84
Within 24 hours, I had ordered the special operations units to assemble in North Carolina.

4
00:00:15.48 --> 00:00:16.76
On the seal side,

5
00:00:17.24 --> 00:00:20.80
all were senior enlisted from the same seal squadron,

6
00:00:20.80 --> 00:00:23.16
all were hand-picked by the seal commander,

7
00:00:23.16 --> 00:00:25.64
all had extensive combat experience.

8
00:00:25.64 --> 00:00:30.64
The aviation crews were equally experienced and also hand-picked.

9
00:00:30.64 --> 00:00:36.64
But none of them knew why they were being asked to come to North Carolina on such short notice.

10
00:00:37.64 --> 00:00:44.64
The following day, as we ushered the members of the brave team into the conference room at our North Carolina location,

11
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:47.64
I could see a look of annoyance on their faces.

12
00:00:47.64 --> 00:00:54.64
By this time, I had briefed my boss Admiral Eric Olson on the Bin Laden mission.

13
00:00:55.64 --> 00:00:59.32
Olson, along with the undersecretary of defense for intelligence,

14
00:00:59.32 --> 00:01:04.64
Mike Vickers and several CIA senior officers were also present in the conference room.

15
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:07.08
The operators,

16
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:08.64
body language was unmistakable.

17
00:01:09.64 --> 00:01:16.64
Clearly, they thought they had been dragged out of Virginia Beach and Fort Campbell to participate in some kind of no notice exercise,

18
00:01:16.64 --> 00:01:18.64
just to impress the brass.

19
00:01:19.64 --> 00:01:24.64
I offered some short welcoming remarks and then turned over the briefing to a CIA officer.

20
00:01:25.64 --> 00:01:29.64
He began by handing out non-disclosure forms.

21
00:01:30.64 --> 00:01:34.64
I watched with some amusement as the body language began to change.

22
00:01:35.64 --> 00:01:40.64
Rarely, were non-disclosure forms required for exercises, even sensitive ones.

23
00:01:40.64 --> 00:01:45.64
They took a few minutes before the forms were signed and collected.

24
00:01:46.64 --> 00:01:52.64
Then another CIA official stepped up on the small stage and began to brief the target.

25
00:01:53.64 --> 00:01:56.64
The operators shifted in their chairs,

26
00:01:57.64 --> 00:02:00.64
sitting up to focus on the slides on the screen.

27
00:02:01.64 --> 00:02:03.64
The CIA officer began.

28
00:02:03.64 --> 00:02:10.64
Gentlemen, for the past several months, the CIA has been tracking an individual we call the Pacer.

29
00:02:11.64 --> 00:02:13.64
Embedded in the slide was a link.

30
00:02:13.64 --> 00:02:16.64
The CIA officer clicked on the link and a video played on the screen.

31
00:02:17.64 --> 00:02:22.64
Everyone watched as the Pacer moved around the compound at AC1.

32
00:02:23.64 --> 00:02:29.64
We have reason to believe that the Pacer is Osama Bin Laden.

33
00:02:29.64 --> 00:02:34.64
At the sound of Bin Laden's name, there were silence in the room.

34
00:02:35.64 --> 00:02:39.64
I could see a number of the seals glancing around at each other as if to ask,

35
00:02:39.64 --> 00:02:42.64
Are they screwing with us or is this for real?

36
00:02:43.64 --> 00:02:46.64
The briefing went on for another 30 minutes.

37
00:02:46.64 --> 00:02:51.64
After the CIA analyst finished, I pushed away from my table, stood up,

38
00:02:51.64 --> 00:02:55.64
and made sure everyone was clear on why we were here.

39
00:02:55.64 --> 00:03:01.64
Gentlemen, I told them the president has asked us to develop a raid option

40
00:03:02.64 --> 00:03:04.64
to capture or kill Bin Laden.

41
00:03:05.64 --> 00:03:09.64
For the past several weeks, a small team has been planning the mission,

42
00:03:09.64 --> 00:03:12.64
but now we have to find out whether the plan is executable.

43
00:03:13.64 --> 00:03:16.64
We have less than three weeks to test and rehearse the plan.

44
00:03:17.64 --> 00:03:20.64
At the end of that time, I have to report back to the president

45
00:03:20.64 --> 00:03:22.64
on the viability of the mission.

46
00:03:22.64 --> 00:03:27.64
There was no emotion from the operators, no smiles, no acknowledgement

47
00:03:28.64 --> 00:03:30.64
of the magnitude of the operation.

48
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:33.64
Now, it was all business.

49
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:38.64
I continued, the agency has built a mock-up of the compound

50
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:39.64
just a mile from here.

51
00:03:40.64 --> 00:03:43.64
You have two days to work through the movements on target.

52
00:03:44.64 --> 00:03:47.64
After that, we will move to another location out west

53
00:03:47.64 --> 00:03:49.64
to do the full dress rehearsals.

54
00:03:49.64 --> 00:03:54.64
I offered the other senior officers an opportunity to say a few words,

55
00:03:55.64 --> 00:03:58.64
but they recognized that this was about the operators not a time

56
00:03:59.64 --> 00:04:02.64
to wax philosophically about the importance of the mission.

57
00:04:03.64 --> 00:04:05.64
I will turn you over to your boss,

58
00:04:06.64 --> 00:04:08.64
and you guys can work out the details.

59
00:04:09.64 --> 00:04:10.64
Any questions?

60
00:04:11.64 --> 00:04:12.64
There were none.

61
00:04:14.64 --> 00:04:15.64
All right, I said,

62
00:04:15.64 --> 00:04:18.64
let's get to work.

63
00:04:21.64 --> 00:04:25.64
And that right there is an excerpt of the book C Stories,

64
00:04:26.64 --> 00:04:29.64
which was written by Admiral William McCraven.

65
00:04:30.64 --> 00:04:35.64
Admiral McCraven served 37 years in the Navy,

66
00:04:36.64 --> 00:04:39.64
and held just about every position of leadership.

67
00:04:39.64 --> 00:04:44.64
There is from seal platoon commander all the way up to four star

68
00:04:45.64 --> 00:04:49.64
commander of all United States special operations forces.

69
00:04:50.64 --> 00:04:54.64
He oversaw thousands and thousands of combat operations around the globe

70
00:04:55.64 --> 00:04:58.64
during his time in service, including some of the most important

71
00:04:59.64 --> 00:05:02.64
operations, and perhaps the most important

72
00:05:03.64 --> 00:05:06.64
operation in the history of US special operations,

73
00:05:06.64 --> 00:05:09.64
the killing of Osama bin Laden.

74
00:05:11.64 --> 00:05:15.64
And all the while, even with that incredible burden of command,

75
00:05:16.64 --> 00:05:19.64
Admiral McCraven was always connected with the troops.

76
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:24.64
As an example, he stopped by my little base and bagged

77
00:05:25.64 --> 00:05:28.64
and said hi to this common platoon commander as we geared up for a mission

78
00:05:29.64 --> 00:05:32.64
and asked Ernest questions about what we were doing and how we were doing it.

79
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:36.64
And it listened intently as I explained my little part of the war.

80
00:05:37.64 --> 00:05:42.64
He was always present, thoughtful, respected, balanced,

81
00:05:43.64 --> 00:05:48.64
and as good of a representative of the seal community as we could have hoped for.

82
00:05:49.64 --> 00:05:57.64
And we have the honor of having him with us here tonight to share his vast experiences

83
00:05:58.64 --> 00:06:00.64
and lessons learned.

84
00:06:00.64 --> 00:06:02.64
Admiral, thank you for joining us.

85
00:06:03.64 --> 00:06:07.64
That's from the book Seastories.

86
00:06:08.64 --> 00:06:11.64
Now you've written four books thus far.

87
00:06:12.64 --> 00:06:16.64
Seastories make your bed, your latest one, which was called The Hero Code,

88
00:06:17.64 --> 00:06:23.64
and then spec ops, case studies and special operations, warfare and practice.

89
00:06:24.64 --> 00:06:27.64
I'll probably spend some time, well, I'm going a little bit,

90
00:06:27.64 --> 00:06:32.64
I'll go into the, go, go, go a ray of books that you've written at some point.

91
00:06:33.64 --> 00:06:40.64
And Seastories is sort of, well, you were saying that's about as close to memoirs we're going to get from you.

92
00:06:41.64 --> 00:06:43.64
I guess this podcast, but now I have to do this.

93
00:06:44.64 --> 00:06:48.64
I'm going to dive into Seastories first and because it relates some of your early experiences.

94
00:06:49.64 --> 00:06:50.64
Here's the deal.

95
00:06:51.64 --> 00:06:55.64
I'm going to just read little tiny chunks of this book because you read your own audiobooks, which is awesome.

96
00:06:55.64 --> 00:07:03.64
So people can go out and buy those, but in order to maybe trigger us and some other conversations and some stuff that's not in the books, I'll set it up.

97
00:07:04.64 --> 00:07:08.64
And I always like to start at the beginning and find out, you know, who these people are,

98
00:07:09.64 --> 00:07:14.64
where they came from, how they ended up the way they did and you got a pretty good, pretty good interesting background.

99
00:07:15.64 --> 00:07:17.64
And with that, I'm going to go to the book here.

100
00:07:18.64 --> 00:07:19.64
Talk to your dad.

101
00:07:20.64 --> 00:07:22.64
When I asked him years later, why he joined the military.

102
00:07:22.64 --> 00:07:30.64
He said that as a boy, he watched soldiers march through the streets of his hometown of Marston, Missouri and board a train bound for the trenches of France.

103
00:07:31.64 --> 00:07:33.64
His father and army surgeon was one of those men.

104
00:07:34.64 --> 00:07:36.64
He knew then that he wanted to be a soldier.

105
00:07:37.64 --> 00:07:47.64
After graduating from aviation officer school at Brookfield in San Antonio, Texas, he received orders to the 39th fighter squadron, eight air force.

106
00:07:47.64 --> 00:07:52.64
The 39th was part of the first American contingent to be posted in the United Kingdom.

107
00:07:53.64 --> 00:08:00.64
At the time, the Americans were still working to build a fighter aircraft that could complete in aerial combat against the German measurement.

108
00:08:01.64 --> 00:08:06.64
So when dad arrived in England, he and the other pilots of the 309th were given British spitfires.

109
00:08:07.64 --> 00:08:14.64
The spits equipped with a powerful Rolls Royce engines, new guns and sleek aerodynamics were good enough to go toe to toe with the Germans.

110
00:08:14.64 --> 00:08:24.64
Dad flew the spitfire throughout the war, going on to fight in the campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, Solerano, and eventually at the Normandy invasion.

111
00:08:25.64 --> 00:08:31.64
He registered two confirmed kills during the war, but would himself be shot down over France in 1943.

112
00:08:32.64 --> 00:08:40.64
The saga of his escape and invasion from France back to England was told many times during our posting in France, but not by dad who rarely talked about his wartime service.

113
00:08:40.64 --> 00:08:48.64
But by the French resistance fighter who helped him back to freedom and now lived near us on the outskirts of Paris.

114
00:08:49.64 --> 00:08:53.64
So your dad's freaking war hero coming out again.

115
00:08:54.64 --> 00:08:56.64
Well I think they were all heroes back then.

116
00:08:57.64 --> 00:08:58.64
I mean, you think about this greatest generation.

117
00:08:59.64 --> 00:09:08.64
And I was forced to grow up as a kid in San Antonio, Texas, that all of my dad's friends even back then had served in the Air Force or the Army Air Corps or the Army.

118
00:09:08.64 --> 00:09:11.64
And they all fought in World War II.

119
00:09:12.64 --> 00:09:17.64
So you know, you experience these, you kind of remarkable stories from these guys.

120
00:09:18.64 --> 00:09:23.64
But of course that generation, both my father and my mother, you know, they grow up during the Depression.

121
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:30.64
They grow up as children of World War I, as I mentioned, my dad watched his father go off to serve in World War I.

122
00:09:31.64 --> 00:09:35.64
And my grandfather also, he was young enough that he came back and served in World War II.

123
00:09:35.64 --> 00:09:38.64
So as a combat surgeon.

124
00:09:39.64 --> 00:09:41.64
And then of course all the men go off to World War II.

125
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:44.64
So yeah, they had these stories.

126
00:09:45.64 --> 00:09:46.64
And I think the stories helped him.

127
00:09:47.64 --> 00:09:57.64
One of the reasons that I wrote the book, Sea Stories, was because the stories that my father told, I know helped him and that group deal with the challenges that they had in life.

128
00:09:58.64 --> 00:10:00.64
Stories help you do that, as you well know.

129
00:10:00.64 --> 00:10:11.64
And frankly, writing the stories and the book Sea Stories kind of helped me. It was cathartic. You know, you put these stories down on paper. You remember them. You remember the people. You remember your emotions.

130
00:10:12.64 --> 00:10:15.64
And it's frankly helpful to get those stories out sometimes.

131
00:10:16.64 --> 00:10:18.64
Yeah, so did your dad stay in the Army?

132
00:10:19.64 --> 00:10:23.64
So if you're a career Army guy, the, he joined the Army Air Corps, which became the Air Force.

133
00:10:24.64 --> 00:10:26.64
So yeah, he spent 26 years in the Air Force retired as Colonel.

134
00:10:26.64 --> 00:10:31.64
And flew until he had a heart attack, something about the risky and cigarettes.

135
00:10:32.64 --> 00:10:34.64
And had a heart attack while we were over in France.

136
00:10:35.64 --> 00:10:37.64
And so that took him all flying status.

137
00:10:38.64 --> 00:10:45.64
They sent him back to the Fort Sam Houston, actually, to Brook Air Force base or to Lackland Air Force base to Brook Medical Center there.

138
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:48.64
Recovered and then retired out of Lackland.

139
00:10:49.64 --> 00:10:52.64
And you were growing up. You were, what was your behavior like?

140
00:10:52.64 --> 00:10:58.64
I know, you got a pretty good story in there that's, you know, you obviously had a mischievous side, which I guess is just what we're born with.

141
00:10:59.64 --> 00:11:01.64
But you're also a really good athlete.

142
00:11:02.64 --> 00:11:04.64
Yeah, I was a mischievous as a good way to describe it.

143
00:11:05.64 --> 00:11:09.64
And to your point, I think that was the nature of a lot of kids back then.

144
00:11:10.64 --> 00:11:13.64
I grew up born in 1955, but kind of grew up in the 60s.

145
00:11:14.64 --> 00:11:17.64
And this was a time when, you know, the movies were about spies.

146
00:11:17.64 --> 00:11:22.64
You know, I mean, James Bond came out, there was a spy on TV and the man from Uncle.

147
00:11:23.64 --> 00:11:26.64
And even though, you know, I grew up in Texas and it was about Cowboys and Indian sort of thing.

148
00:11:27.64 --> 00:11:31.64
The spy culture back then really kind of, I think, grabbed the young kids, certainly grabbed me.

149
00:11:32.64 --> 00:11:34.64
So yeah, you know, we were always looking at missions to go on.

150
00:11:35.64 --> 00:11:40.64
And you know, when I was, when I was, when I was a preteen, of course, a couple of those got me in some serious trouble.

151
00:11:41.64 --> 00:11:45.64
And yeah, I was good athlete, but I was small. I didn't really start growing until late in high school.

152
00:11:45.64 --> 00:11:51.64
So my dad happened to have been a professional athlete. He played football for the Cleveland Rams running back for the Cleveland Rams.

153
00:11:52.64 --> 00:11:54.64
And that's where he made all this money.

154
00:11:55.64 --> 00:11:59.64
Yeah, I think he told me they paid him $120 a week, which was good money back then.

155
00:12:00.64 --> 00:12:03.64
And then he would get $10 for doing weedies commercials.

156
00:12:04.64 --> 00:12:10.64
So he seemed like he was making pretty good money back then, but he and a bunch of buddies saw that,

157
00:12:10.64 --> 00:12:22.64
and the late 30s early 40s that war was brewing. And they, I think he told me one time he and four of his friends on the football team just got up, drove to California and signed up for the Army Air Corps.

158
00:12:23.64 --> 00:12:27.64
So you're, what about grades? Were you interested in school? Did you care about school?

159
00:12:28.64 --> 00:12:32.64
Yeah, yeah, of course I cared about school. I'm not sure of school care. I'm much about me.

160
00:12:32.64 --> 00:12:40.64
I was an average student. I was an average student at the elementary school in junior high school and high school and in college.

161
00:12:41.64 --> 00:12:48.64
But I worked hard. I worked hard to get the grades. I didn't have a lot of skills in math and science.

162
00:12:49.64 --> 00:12:59.64
And of course, when I look back on my college career, I mean, I changed major four times. It wasn't until I got into journalism, which is what I ended up graduating in,

163
00:12:59.64 --> 00:13:07.64
that I found out I had a little bit of a talent for writing. So I mean, I couldn't do, yeah, I started off in pre-med in college. That didn't work out so well.

164
00:13:08.64 --> 00:13:16.64
I went to a county and that worked out even worse. And then I went to the news reporting and then finally in the broader arena of journalism.

165
00:13:17.64 --> 00:13:23.64
And so when you're going to college, did you, did you have a military career in mind at that point?

166
00:13:23.64 --> 00:13:31.64
Again, again, I had watched my dad and his friends and the one thing I loved about the military was just the camaraderie.

167
00:13:32.64 --> 00:13:42.64
Even after my dad retired, we lived in a residential area in San Antonio called Windcrest. And Windcrest is where a lot of the retired military and a lot of the active duty military lived.

168
00:13:43.64 --> 00:13:48.64
So it was almost like living on base housing. And so all the kids had some sort of connection to the military.

169
00:13:48.64 --> 00:13:58.64
And it was just a great environment to grow up in. And I remember the young age, I decided that kind of, my dad didn't push me. This wasn't the great Santini sort of thing.

170
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:06.64
But I just enjoyed watching how my parents interacted with their friends. And I said, yeah, that's kind of what I want to do.

171
00:14:07.64 --> 00:14:16.64
And my dad wanted me to be a pilot. And my mom wanted me to be a doctor. The doctor was not going to work out. She quickly found out.

172
00:14:16.64 --> 00:14:27.64
But she did get me an ROTC scholarship. She had to do all the work. Again, back then, I don't think I had the discipline to do all the paperwork. My mom worked all the paperwork and said, you know, go to this interview, sign this, do this.

173
00:14:28.64 --> 00:14:33.64
And I got an ROTC scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin and that kind of put me on the path.

174
00:14:34.64 --> 00:14:36.64
How did you heard about the seal teams at this point?

175
00:14:37.64 --> 00:14:44.64
I saw interestingly enough, my sister was dating an army green beret. And this was probably 1971-72.

176
00:14:44.64 --> 00:14:51.64
And of course, the movie, the green beret with John Wayne had come out. And I love the movie. Never heard a seal. It's a death point in time.

177
00:14:52.64 --> 00:15:04.64
And so this army officer comes a young captain comes to pick her up. And this was at a time when it was very unusual because if you're not more still going on, you weren't supposed to wear your class age, you know, your uniform out in public back then.

178
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:09.64
But he comes to pick her up and he's in a uniform. And he's a green beret.

179
00:15:09.64 --> 00:15:15.64
And so my sister notoriously late, so I'm kind of entertaining the guy. I'm about 16, 17 years old, I guess.

180
00:15:16.64 --> 00:15:23.64
And he says, well, what are you going to do? And I said, well, you know, I'm looking at going into the Navy and ROTC. He says, well, then you need to be a Navy seal.

181
00:15:24.64 --> 00:15:28.64
I'd never heard of Navy seals. And he had just come back from a touring Vietnam, he goes, let me tell you.

182
00:15:29.64 --> 00:15:36.64
Seals of the best guys in the Navy. If you want to do something special, you go be a Navy seal, I'm thinking, this is an army green beret, telling me to go be a Navy seal.

183
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:41.64
And that really is kind of what's spurred me. And then there was one article back then, not like it was today, of course.

184
00:15:42.64 --> 00:15:50.64
Back then, you couldn't find out about seals, but I got on microfish in the library. I found one article called men with green faces.

185
00:15:51.64 --> 00:15:59.64
Kind of it's a classic, but it was in some old men's magazine, you know, back then they used to have these men's magazines and adventure magazines sort of thing.

186
00:15:59.64 --> 00:16:06.64
And I must have read that article a hundred times trying to find out what it was like, of course, there was nothing on buzz. It was all about the teams.

187
00:16:07.64 --> 00:16:14.64
Interestingly enough, about probably 10 years, 15 years later, I found that article, the microfish, you know, photocopy of it.

188
00:16:15.64 --> 00:16:26.64
And of course, I knew all the guys in the article. It was Ed Bowen and it was Bob Mayberry and it was Bob Gorman. I mean, guys that now I was kind of serving with that we're actually in the article. So it was a interesting.

189
00:16:26.64 --> 00:16:34.64
Now, you made, you, you talk about this and make your bed. You, you go to visit buds. Was this like your junior year?

190
00:16:35.64 --> 00:16:37.64
So I was, yeah, it was between my junior and senior year.

191
00:16:38.64 --> 00:16:44.64
And, you know, we had some time off in the summer. And so I wanted to go see what what buds was all about.

192
00:16:45.64 --> 00:16:54.64
So I took a flight to San Diego and I show up at the compound, which is, I guess, they're demolishing it now, but so this was 1976.

193
00:16:54.64 --> 00:17:02.64
And I show up and I, and I go to the court of that kind of unannounced and I, I tell them that I'd like to see something I talk about going through buds training.

194
00:17:03.64 --> 00:17:08.64
So the lieutenant who was running at the time is guy named Doug Youth, Vietnam vet, very distinguished, great officer.

195
00:17:09.64 --> 00:17:21.64
And so I'm waiting outside and I, I looked down the hallway and I remember this very vitally and I, I see this guy down the hallway and, of course, you remember how it's set up, you know, the officers are off to one side and we, back then with the, always his posters.

196
00:17:21.64 --> 00:17:28.64
And they were, you know, Vietnam aeroposters, you know, manly men doing manly things, me guys with bandlears on, guys in the mud with the stoner.

197
00:17:29.64 --> 00:17:38.64
And the sky is kind of looking up at these posters, you know, kind of, you know, longingly and, and looking at what I'm thinking of myself, you have got to be kidding me.

198
00:17:38.64 --> 00:17:53.64
I mean, this guy, you know, he was thin kind of frail and had a little bit of a mop of long hair and I thought he was a dependent, you know, but he's kind of looking up and I'm thinking, man, does this guy really think he could be an AV seal?

199
00:17:54.64 --> 00:17:58.64
Doesn't he know, I mean, maybe seals, post looked like me, you know, six foot two eyes of blue big bronzy guys.

200
00:17:59.64 --> 00:18:05.64
And so I was watching this guy, you know, I'm waiting and thinking, I feel sorry for this guy if he really thinks he could make it through a seal training.

201
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:17.64
So a few months later, I get called into the youth's office and I'm sitting there talking to Doug youth and out of the corner of my eye, I can see this guy kind of walking across in front of the doorway and finally, Doug youth stops me and he goes, hey, Bill, hold us there.

202
00:18:18.64 --> 00:18:19.64
I want to introduce you to somebody.

203
00:18:20.64 --> 00:18:21.64
He said, Tommy, Tommy, come in here.

204
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:30.64
So this is Tommy Norris. He's the last seal middle of honor recipient from Vietnam, and of course, as you all know, Jaco, Tommy, one of the toughest guys that ever went through seal training.

205
00:18:30.64 --> 00:18:36.64
And it just reinforced the fact, and of course, when you get in seal training, you realize this, they ain't about how big you are, they ain't about how fast you are.

206
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:46.64
I mean, Tommy Norris, one of the toughest guys, because, you know, he had the heart to big enough to make it through the toughness, the determination, everything that we're looking for in seals.

207
00:18:47.64 --> 00:18:52.64
And so a lot of guys who go through the think it's all about, you know, how fast you can run and how much you can bench press and they're missing the point.

208
00:18:53.64 --> 00:18:56.64
The Tommy Norris is the world to the ones that rule the teams.

209
00:18:56.64 --> 00:19:01.64
Crazy how many guys with a big bench or a great runtime quit.

210
00:19:02.64 --> 00:19:06.64
Yeah. It's nuts. Right. So all the early on, right, we had this, we had two guys that look like weight lifters.

211
00:19:07.64 --> 00:19:08.64
I don't think they made it through the first week.

212
00:19:09.64 --> 00:19:10.64
Yeah, it's not what you're looking for, you know.

213
00:19:11.64 --> 00:19:16.64
And Lieutenant Huth, who checked you in the first phase, he was the, he was the seal of all of Buds when I went.

214
00:19:17.64 --> 00:19:19.64
Oh, he's the captain in charge of the set of great guys.

215
00:19:20.64 --> 00:19:23.64
So, so you end up going back finish your senior year,

216
00:19:23.64 --> 00:19:26.64
and then you got, you got to order something.

217
00:19:27.64 --> 00:19:28.64
Was it hard to get to go to Buds then?

218
00:19:29.64 --> 00:19:33.64
It wasn't again, back then, Buds was actually a course at the Naval Enthibia School.

219
00:19:34.64 --> 00:19:37.64
So it was not its own command. It was just a course that was running at the Naval Enthibia School.

220
00:19:38.64 --> 00:19:40.64
And when I got orders, I was at the University of Texas.

221
00:19:41.64 --> 00:19:45.64
I remember when my orders came in and it didn't say basically under water demolition seal training.

222
00:19:46.64 --> 00:19:47.64
It had a course number on it.

223
00:19:48.64 --> 00:19:50.64
And it said something about explosive training, but that was about it.

224
00:19:50.64 --> 00:19:55.64
And so I didn't even know whether these were the right orders to go to Buds.

225
00:19:56.64 --> 00:19:59.64
So I'm calling around, but again, back then, nobody knew about seal training.

226
00:20:00.64 --> 00:20:04.64
So, you know, one of the officers had to call the detailer who back then,

227
00:20:05.64 --> 00:20:08.64
our detailers and for your audience, the detailers are the guys that, that send you,

228
00:20:09.64 --> 00:20:10.64
give you the orders where to go.

229
00:20:11.64 --> 00:20:16.64
Well, we didn't have a seal detailer back then. It was an EOD and explosive ordinance disposal officer that managed the seal community.

230
00:20:16.64 --> 00:20:21.64
So yeah, he said, I don't know. It's it's the course number. So of course, I show up turned out it.

231
00:20:22.64 --> 00:20:23.64
It was the right place to go.

232
00:20:24.64 --> 00:20:25.64
We just had billposey on.

233
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:26.64
Yeah.

234
00:20:27.64 --> 00:20:28.64
And he showed up to Buds, whatever.

235
00:20:29.64 --> 00:20:30.64
Course number it was.

236
00:20:31.64 --> 00:20:34.64
Same thing. And he thought it was a course he asked, like, hey, do I need a backpack for the books?

237
00:20:35.64 --> 00:20:36.64
And I'm like, what do you think he need books for?

238
00:20:37.64 --> 00:20:39.64
He says for the course that I thought that had no idea what he was doing.

239
00:20:40.64 --> 00:20:42.64
He thought he was going to go and he's got, thought he's going to some kind of advanced dive,

240
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:44.64
dive, right card hat dive score or something like that.

241
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:52.64
And I was also thinking about Dick Thompson, a guy named Dick Thompson on who was a green brain Vietnam.

242
00:20:53.64 --> 00:20:55.64
He's so he joined the army voluntarily.

243
00:20:56.64 --> 00:20:59.64
Then he volunteered for special forces. Then he volunteered for OCS when it became an officer.

244
00:21:00.64 --> 00:21:04.64
And I said, hey, was it hard to, you know, when you, was it hard to get those billets?

245
00:21:05.64 --> 00:21:07.64
And he goes, no, because it was Vietnam.

246
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:10.64
They're like, oh, you want to be an officer? Cool. Go ahead.

247
00:21:10.64 --> 00:21:13.64
You want to be in special forces? Cool. Go ahead. Are you on joining the army? Everything was easy.

248
00:21:14.64 --> 00:21:20.64
Well, and I don't, I said, all you had to do is pass the PT test. And of course, you know, the PT test is not all that hard.

249
00:21:21.64 --> 00:21:24.64
You pass PT test. You get orders to, to buds.

250
00:21:25.64 --> 00:21:28.64
I mean, I think it was that easy back then. And again, I can't, I can't talk to the naval academy guys.

251
00:21:29.64 --> 00:21:33.64
But for those of us in our T.C. Hey, if you raised your hand and you wanted to go, you were probably going to get a billet.

252
00:21:34.64 --> 00:21:36.64
Did you have any idea what you're getting into?

253
00:21:36.64 --> 00:21:41.64
None, none whatsoever. Again, there were, there were no books, there were no movies, there was nothing on seal training.

254
00:21:42.64 --> 00:21:45.64
I knew nothing about what we were going to do. I just knew that I wasn't going to quit.

255
00:21:46.64 --> 00:21:49.64
They were going to have to kill me if they were going to stop me from getting through.

256
00:21:49.64 --> 00:21:53.64
How is your water competency? Yeah, good. I mean, I was good swimmer.

257
00:21:54.64 --> 00:21:57.64
Okay. And I've been scuba diving since I was 13. So I learned dive yarn.

258
00:21:58.64 --> 00:22:02.64
So the water, I mean, I thought we'd actually spend more time in that course. We did spend a lot of time swimming.

259
00:22:03.64 --> 00:22:04.64
But I was always good swimmer. So that was not an issue.

260
00:22:04.64 --> 00:22:09.64
Yeah, I think that's a big, that's a big problem for guys that show up from Iowa.

261
00:22:10.64 --> 00:22:14.64
They grew up wrestling and weightlifting or whatever, but they didn't swim. That's a problem.

262
00:22:15.64 --> 00:22:17.64
Or particularly swimming in the surf. I mean, those are different.

263
00:22:18.64 --> 00:22:25.64
You can get in the pool and make pretty good laps, but there were a lot of kids that came in with me that all of a sudden, you know, you see the surf, particularly in the winter time off Coronado.

264
00:22:26.64 --> 00:22:29.64
And you know, you get 10, 12 foot breakers. They're like, well, never seen that before.

265
00:22:29.64 --> 00:22:35.64
So that was a bit of a shock for him. I've been your class leader was was Daniel Stewart.

266
00:22:36.64 --> 00:22:45.64
And I'll still want to find his officers. I ever served him with. And Daniel had been rolled back. He had the as you recall and it towards the end of the first phase of training.

267
00:22:46.64 --> 00:22:48.64
Or maybe it was right before Hellweek.

268
00:22:49.64 --> 00:22:56.64
We did cast and recovery. So you take an inflatable boat small and you tie it up along. What we had was called a PL, which is a little small boat back then.

269
00:22:56.64 --> 00:23:03.64
And then you hook the old classic frog men and world war two. You hook your arm through the sling. Well, and of course, so hook in his arm through the sling.

270
00:23:04.64 --> 00:23:10.64
The guy caught the arm too low, ripped out his bicep. And so Daniel had to get rolled back. Fortunately for us he ends up being a class leader.

271
00:23:11.64 --> 00:23:14.64
And he was lieutenant J. J. The other officers in the class. We were all in since.

272
00:23:15.64 --> 00:23:19.64
And Daniel had been in the fleet. So he was already a surface warfare officer, Naval Academy graduate.

273
00:23:19.64 --> 00:23:29.64
Exactly the guy we needed to frankly get through training. Again, I knew nothing about what I was stepping into. And neither did the other two officers that were with us.

274
00:23:30.64 --> 00:23:38.64
We were all kind of bright and bushy tail. But, but Daniel had already been through it and had some great great ideas on how we were going to make it through. And he's the one to got us through.

275
00:23:39.64 --> 00:23:41.64
He was my first commanding officer at T. O. T. One.

276
00:23:41.64 --> 00:23:48.64
And he was, I guess in the modern term that we would say we would say he was jacked. He was like still is.

277
00:23:49.64 --> 00:23:55.64
And because he was a gymnast, wasn't he a gymnast? So he was the first human being because I didn't know anything about gymnastics.

278
00:23:56.64 --> 00:24:00.64
But he was out on the old pull-up bar behind the T. O. T. One. And he was doing muscle ups on the pull-up bar.

279
00:24:01.64 --> 00:24:05.64
I didn't even know what that was. And I remember thinking, damn, I got some work to do over here.

280
00:24:05.64 --> 00:24:17.64
That's a new guy. The instructors. So you've got, I mean, this is first of all, they're basically unchange. There's no supervision.

281
00:24:18.64 --> 00:24:19.64
I don't know a double supervision, right?

282
00:24:20.64 --> 00:24:23.64
Well, I think there was. But of course, as as trainees, you don't think there is.

283
00:24:24.64 --> 00:24:34.64
And you think they have the latitude to do anything to you. So I think that was part of the psychological advantage I had was if there was, in fact, the double supervision, which I think there was.

284
00:24:34.64 --> 00:24:43.64
I think they had certain criteria. We didn't know it. So I think today, again, the students going through because they have such a good understanding, they know the instructors aren't going to kill them.

285
00:24:44.64 --> 00:24:46.64
I can be honest with you. I'm not sure we knew that back then.

286
00:24:47.64 --> 00:24:51.64
And some of them seem to mean enough to do that. But they're all Vietnam vets.

287
00:24:52.64 --> 00:24:58.64
You know, these salty old crusty old guys and of course, as a young kid, I mean, you look up to these Vietnam vets as we should.

288
00:24:58.64 --> 00:25:07.64
Great combat experience, great stores and you wanted to be like these guys. And of course, they wanted you to be tough enough, mentally tough enough, physically tough enough to join them in the teams.

289
00:25:08.64 --> 00:25:20.64
And you knew that was a standard you were fighting for. So it was great to have those guys be your instructors because, you know, we looked up to them so much and we just wanted to do the best by them.

290
00:25:20.64 --> 00:25:32.64
What was. Was it like just the normal kind of 80 75 or 80% of nutrition rate? Yeah, something. When we started with, I went back and had to check the numbers.

291
00:25:33.64 --> 00:25:37.64
We started with 110 guys. Lee sets with a roster show. We ended up with 33.

292
00:25:38.64 --> 00:25:43.64
So right about the same nutrition. And yet 33 back then was a large class.

293
00:25:43.64 --> 00:25:54.64
The class before us, I think, had finished with the 18 or 20, which was about normal back then. Again, I attribute a lot of our success to that, a steward who managed to keep the class together during the tough times.

294
00:25:55.64 --> 00:26:05.64
And they were actually very impressed. Remember the instructors watched us very closely because we got a lot of guys through a hell week. I think we ended up getting almost 55 guys through hell week. And we lost a lot of guys after that.

295
00:26:05.64 --> 00:26:14.64
But still ending up with 33 guys was a large class. And the instructors were trying to figure out how did you guys do that because we need to get more guys through.

296
00:26:15.64 --> 00:26:20.64
Well, the answer was, had great leadership and that always helps when you're in challenging situations.

297
00:26:21.64 --> 00:26:30.64
Did I know you talk a little bit about in one of the books about instructor faculty who ended up being my first master chief at COT1.

298
00:26:30.64 --> 00:26:44.64
And he's a guy that really instilled, well, the professionalism because in the SEAL teams, especially I would say more so back then, but there was like a professional side.

299
00:26:45.64 --> 00:26:52.64
And there was an equally strong sort of hell's angels sort of sort of spirit that you could jump into. And like great guys on both sides.

300
00:26:52.64 --> 00:27:09.64
I think that match you faculty for me sort of leaned me in kind of my group. At least put some level of, hey, you got to be square away. You got to present yourself. You know, this is the military wearing the navy like all those little things which you go to some other.

301
00:27:09.64 --> 00:27:23.64
Some other deeper darker AOs and the SEAL teams. There was none of that going on. And I just appreciated that fact and it like I said, it had a had a good influence on me because when you're young and impressionable.

302
00:27:24.64 --> 00:27:31.64
I just wanted to be a good seal. And if you told me a good seal was having a good haircut and wearing a square away uniform. Okay, that's what I'm doing.

303
00:27:32.64 --> 00:27:34.64
Luckily people like that were around.

304
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:48.64
Yeah, and I think you nailed it, Jack. I mean, that was consistent with what I thought saw with faculty throughout his career. And as we talked before the podcast, you know, Mike and I became very good friends. We were neighbors and and you'll invest a and he and Daniel Stewart stayed very, very good friends.

305
00:27:49.64 --> 00:27:57.64
So Mike was actually our proctor again for your listeners. So the proctor was the the senior enlisted that really was in charge of your phase. So he was our first phase proctor.

306
00:27:57.64 --> 00:28:16.64
And that was really important because it kind of sets the tone for the rest of the three phases. But faculty as the proctor and Daniel Stewart is the class leader. You know, they worked well together. And faculty would, you know, give us little tips on, you know, how to get through certain evolutions and events kind of pass through Daniel Stewart.

307
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:27.64
So that team, that team work between faculty as a proctor and Stewart as the as a class leader was helpful. But Mike was always professional. I mean, he was perfect. And as you know, the instructors loved to harass you.

308
00:28:28.64 --> 00:28:37.64
And you know, some of them harass you with a little bit of a mean spirit. Some of them have a good sense of humor. And of course, faculty could always do it with a little bit of a twinkle in his eye.

309
00:28:37.64 --> 00:28:52.64
I mean, you, that's not say you weren't suffering the pain. You were suffering the pain. But there was always a little smile, a little bit of a twinkle in his eye. And you knew that he was going to, you know, get you through this evolution, even though he was harassed it.

310
00:28:53.64 --> 00:28:56.64
Yeah, the thing I think I learned.

311
00:28:56.64 --> 00:29:09.64
Well, again, never really broke it down like this, but this sort of professional side versus this kind of hell's angel side. I think what I what what I learned from faculty was that what we were there to do was.

312
00:29:09.64 --> 00:29:25.64
Was do the do the mission of the country, right? And if you wanted to do that, that's what you were there to do to kill bad guys to go out and execute operations. What's the look? This is the 90s when I stood up there was I missed the first call for, but as far as I could tell, if you wanted to do that.

313
00:29:25.64 --> 00:29:38.64
If you wanted to actually do the missions for the country, then you had to be professional, right? And that was the connection that I kind of made and and by the way, you know, the idea of being a frog man.

314
00:29:39.64 --> 00:29:52.64
What could what could possibly Trump doing being a good operator for being a frogman is nothing that Trump said. It's not any of that other stuff that you can that there's plenty of in the sealed teams, but there's there's nothing that Trump's hey.

315
00:29:52.64 --> 00:30:09.64
I'm a good I want to be a good operator. I want to be able to do my job well. I want to go out and execute missions. And that professionalism I think is a I mean it was a key component for me and my career and something that I think people like mastery faculty embedded in enough people that it it carries on.

316
00:30:09.64 --> 00:30:23.64
No, you know, you're exactly right. The fact of matter is there was a little bit of the the duality of if you will of the kind of the health angels and the professionals, but even the health angels understood that if you were going to do a complex seal mission,

317
00:30:23.64 --> 00:30:49.64
but you better have the highest standards possible. You better know your business. You better rehearse it to the end degree. You are not going to come in and be cavalier about people's lives or about making sure that we're going to be successful on a mission. So I mean again, I was fortunate. I had a guy named Lieutenant John Wright and John was a young probably incident or Lieutenant J. G in Vietnam, but when I got to underwater demolition team 11, John kind of took me under his wing.

318
00:30:49.64 --> 00:31:05.64
And it was all about the professionalism and it first was okay, incident, McRaven, you need to learn the basics. You need to know everything you can find out about demolition, about parachuting, about weapons you better be able to break apart every single up because John Wright could do that.

319
00:31:05.64 --> 00:31:22.64
Now you know you had that expectation if you wanted to see your listed guys, but his expectation was you can't lead the man under you. If you don't know the skill set, it equally as well. At the end of the day you never know it quite as good as the unless to guys do, but you want to make sure you've put in the effort.

320
00:31:22.64 --> 00:31:39.64
And so John instilled in me, hey, you got to work hard every single day. You've got to earn their respect every single day. The day you think you don't have to earn their respect that you become so senior or you become so entitled, then you're the wrong person to be leading.

321
00:31:39.64 --> 00:31:58.64
And that was instilled in me at a very young age. Fortunately, my faculty and I ended up working together a number of times. Later, he became my command master chief and until your point, Jaco, I mean he was a guy that set the standards high and expected everybody to meet the standards or exceed the standards.

322
00:31:58.64 --> 00:32:09.64
And the standards were the standards and I don't care whether you were his friend or somebody he didn't like if you couldn't meet the standards, then you were going to be a good team.

323
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:15.64
Before we jump in a UDT 11, it sounded like you almost had a damn he low crash at the end of Buds.

324
00:32:15.64 --> 00:32:31.64
We did. Yeah, so it was the very last day of Buds train. And this was the next day we were going to graduate back at the time. You know, when you finished Buds training, that's when you had the big graduation, you didn't get your trident, but all the parents would come out.

325
00:32:31.64 --> 00:32:49.64
So this was the day before the graduation. And the last evolution was helicopter cast and recovery. And so the parents that had come out for the graduation, the following day, all showed up on Turner Field and Turner Field is in there here in Coronado where the helicopter would land. They put some bleachers out there for all the parents to sit in.

326
00:32:49.64 --> 00:33:03.64
And of course the instructor who at the time was Lieutenant Moeke Martin, you know, makes the parents think that, you know, your your sons are about to be Navy frogmen, you know, and this is a, this is a really tough evolution. It's a dangerous evolution.

327
00:33:03.64 --> 00:33:10.64
And so he kind of built up a high-pull little bit for all the parents. When in fact, you know, helicopter cast recovery is a pretty straightforward operation.

328
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:20.64
And all the adults do it actually were the first two sticks. So we board the 46, the Navy 46. And so we go out picked up off Turner Field. We fly out over the bay.

329
00:33:20.64 --> 00:33:25.64
And the ideas, you know, they drop each stick off and that stick. I think we're at seven eight guys in the stick.

330
00:33:25.64 --> 00:33:39.64
And so Daniel's the first stick out. And I'm the first guy in the second stick. So I get dropped off. Well, the needle comes back around picks up Daniel's guys picks up me. I'm the first guy in the stick. And as I get into the helicopter, I sit down on the, on the Ben seat.

331
00:33:39.64 --> 00:33:46.64
And yeah, this doesn't look quite right. I'm up to my waist and water. And I'm thinking, I don't think he goes supposed to be doing.

332
00:33:46.64 --> 00:33:57.64
Of course, as I look in the cockpit here, the pilots there, fighting the helo, the, the crew chief. We had actually landed, we lost power in one of the engines. So the helicopter had settled hard into the water.

333
00:33:57.64 --> 00:34:04.64
And one of the guys who was about to be picked up through the hell hole gets landed on. And so now the crew chief, he's running back trying to make sure this guy didn't get knocked out.

334
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:33.64
But now is the helicopter slowly starting to sink. We were following instructions. And back then the instructions were okay, gentlemen. If the helicopter lands in the water, everybody stays seated. The helicopter will sink. It will roll over and you just swim out after that. And of course, we're not smart enough to realize that's a really bad idea. But, you know, it was about 30 feet deep where we were doing this. So he thought, I don't big deal. If it sinks down, will, will swim out. Well, so finally, as the, as a helo has kind of slowly starting to sink, the crew chief realizes, got to get the world out.

335
00:34:33.64 --> 00:34:58.64
Well, we're looking out the side door. And of course, that blade is like almost cliff in the water. And it's like, oh, how about this? But he's given us the go sign. So we all dive out. Well, the pilot's got no control of helicopter. So now is we're all out trying to swim towards a safety boat who is a ways going, I don't think I'm coming. The helo starts to kind of follow us. And finally, you know, we all get out of, get out of harm's way.

336
00:34:58.64 --> 00:35:09.64
And the helo, I mean, the pilot, good pilot, I mean, after about an hour and a half, he manages literally to drive the helo off to point golf, you know, that point over there. And teach the helo.

337
00:35:09.64 --> 00:35:16.64
So he saves the helicopter and nobody got injured, but the funny part about it was as I got told later. So the parents are all in the bleachers.

338
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:23.64
And Lieutenant Martin is telling the story about, oh, you know, helicopter cash. He says, and then all of a sudden all the parents got up there ran past me.

339
00:35:23.64 --> 00:35:31.64
I'm like, what's going on? And of course, the helicopter landed in the water. And I remember faculty as we got back to the got back to the beach.

340
00:35:31.64 --> 00:35:43.64
He said something to the effect of boy, I hope this isn't indication of how the rest of your career is going to go. And of course, it was an invitation of how the rest of the career would go.

341
00:35:43.64 --> 00:35:47.64
That's that's good times. Yeah.

342
00:35:47.64 --> 00:35:59.64
So now you go to UDT 11 and check in the UDT 11 and look like I said, I didn't want to read, I don't want to read a ton of stuff from the books today because you did this stuff on audio book.

343
00:35:59.64 --> 00:36:10.64
But you captured the check in process at a seal team and this was a UDT team, which later became seal teams, but I just, I just had to go. This is this is going to the book, the hero code, your latest book.

344
00:36:10.64 --> 00:36:19.64
And this is what it like checking into a team. So you're the new guy, one of my officers from art. Yes, sir, I responded. It's my first day in the teams.

345
00:36:19.64 --> 00:36:36.64
First day in the teams. Well, you're going to love it here. He said, the guys who will welcome you with open arms. The old Vietnam vets are really nice. They love officers, particularly new officers. They'll treat you really well. Great. I'm looking forward to it. So there we go. Out of the gate, it's a, you can see where this is going.

346
00:36:36.64 --> 00:36:44.64
The slide grin came across the officers face dressed in khaki, swim trunks, boon gold t-shirts, jungle boots. We headed out of the building and on the grinder.

347
00:36:44.64 --> 00:36:50.64
After a short daily briefing from the executive officer, we broke ranks and formed up into a circle, the PT circle.

348
00:36:50.64 --> 00:36:58.64
And then it began. So, and soon, and you are an instant at this time, that's the lowest officer rank in the Navy. So, and today, I understand you went to Texas A&M.

349
00:36:58.64 --> 00:37:03.64
No chief, the University of Texas, not Texas A&M. So you couldn't get into a real school, huh?

350
00:37:03.64 --> 00:37:08.64
Before I could answer someone else offered her a response. He's from Texas. There aren't new real schools in Texas.

351
00:37:08.64 --> 00:37:14.64
Also, you weren't smart enough to get into the academy. We frogman expect our officers to be smart. What did you major in?

352
00:37:14.64 --> 00:37:18.64
I hesitated. Journalism. Chief.

353
00:37:18.64 --> 00:37:26.64
Journalism. You're a damn reporter. Hey, exo. We don't need no damn reporter on our ranks. The executive officer smiled, but said nothing.

354
00:37:26.64 --> 00:37:34.64
What seal training class were you in? A man at the far end of the circle shouted, class 95, a yelled back, you got to be kidding me.

355
00:37:34.64 --> 00:37:41.64
And older officer said, speeding out a water tobacco, I heard class 95 was the easiest class ever. They had a summer hell week.

356
00:37:41.64 --> 00:37:46.64
Over the next 15 minutes, all 50 men in the circle had something to say about my shortfalls.

357
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:54.64
In between repetitions of pushups, flutter kicks, set ups, and burpees, they questioned my parentage, my athleticism, my intellect, my state of origin.

358
00:37:54.64 --> 00:38:05.64
The quality of my sealed training class. And of course, my love life. You got a girlfriend, one of the salty old chiefs asked, I do chief. What she looked like?

359
00:38:05.64 --> 00:38:13.64
Oh, she's pretty, very petite, brown hair, hazel eyes, about five foot four. The chief smiled.

360
00:38:13.64 --> 00:38:19.64
Do you think she'd like a swar the Italian with a mustache? She said, twirling the ends of his long handlebar.

361
00:38:19.64 --> 00:38:27.64
I saw an opening. No chief. I said, looking around the grinder. She likes men that are taller than she is.

362
00:38:27.64 --> 00:38:35.64
The circle went quiet. The chief, who stood no longer than five, no taller than five foot four, got up off the grinder and walked up to where I was standing.

363
00:38:35.64 --> 00:38:39.64
Inches from my face, he sneered at me and said, are you calling me short?

364
00:38:39.64 --> 00:38:46.64
The men in the circle were shaking their heads. One mouth don't go there, Anson. Another said softly, he's very sensitive about his height.

365
00:38:46.64 --> 00:38:53.64
Well, chief, you are looking up at me. I told him, everyone on the grinder stopped exercising and turned my way.

366
00:38:53.64 --> 00:38:58.64
What do you think that's funny, Anson? Do you think insulting a chief petty officer in the United States Navy is funny?

367
00:38:58.64 --> 00:39:04.64
I am very, very sensitive about my height, and that hurts me. I paused what?

368
00:39:04.64 --> 00:39:08.64
Wondering whether I'd taken my, my joke too far.

369
00:39:08.64 --> 00:39:12.64
Suddenly the chief burst out laughing and the rest of the men in the circle joined in.

370
00:39:12.64 --> 00:39:20.64
Welcome to the team, Anson. When the physical training ended the chief and all the other members of the team came by to shake my hand and welcome me to UDT-11.

371
00:39:20.64 --> 00:39:25.64
I'd pass the test. I had a sense of humor.

372
00:39:25.64 --> 00:39:27.64
Good way to check in.

373
00:39:27.64 --> 00:39:30.64
You've been there before, you know, the deal.

374
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:41.64
So I was, I did this even at my program and I got went straight from, from Sealteen 1 as an E5 went to Hofstra, Kenneth, school for 13 weeks, went to Sealteen 2.

375
00:39:41.64 --> 00:39:42.64
As an E5 went to Sealteen 2 as an E5.

376
00:39:42.64 --> 00:39:45.64
So I hadn't been to college. It was a ridiculous program.

377
00:39:45.64 --> 00:39:49.64
I feel like maybe I can get arrested for it or something because it was such a good deal.

378
00:39:49.64 --> 00:39:52.64
Well, and then it did two deployments at Sealteen 2.

379
00:39:52.64 --> 00:39:54.64
And then I went to college.

380
00:39:54.64 --> 00:39:56.64
So I was an officer in college.

381
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:00.64
But it was, I'd been in the Sealteen's my whole adult life.

382
00:40:00.64 --> 00:40:03.64
And so now I'm going to college and I'm coming home.

383
00:40:03.64 --> 00:40:06.64
And, you know, I don't have anyone to banter with.

384
00:40:06.64 --> 00:40:08.64
So it ends up being my wife.

385
00:40:08.64 --> 00:40:17.64
And after about two or three months, finally, you know, I said something about the meal she had made or what she had prepared or something like this.

386
00:40:17.64 --> 00:40:21.64
And she looked at me and she goes, hey, I'm not a team of that.

387
00:40:21.64 --> 00:40:24.64
And I was, and I kind of chuckled.

388
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:34.64
But then I realized she was 100% right, you know, the, the, the lifestyle of being in a cartoon, where it's just constant attacks from everybody.

389
00:40:34.64 --> 00:40:40.64
It's, it's, it's a, it's an environment that you get so used to.

390
00:40:40.64 --> 00:40:42.64
You don't realize that that's just the way it is.

391
00:40:42.64 --> 00:40:46.64
And, and that may actually be the best part, you know, about being in the teams.

392
00:40:46.64 --> 00:40:52.64
And, and for your listeners, I mean, every morning back then, kind of pre 9, 11, we had the PT circle.

393
00:40:52.64 --> 00:40:58.64
And come, hello, hi, water. You know, you were going to break out and you were going to do PT for probably an hour and a half.

394
00:40:58.64 --> 00:41:05.64
And the PT circle was where boy, if, if you were not on your toes, you know, somebody was going to rip you apart.

395
00:41:05.64 --> 00:41:11.64
And, and back to the point, it was this sense of humor, this, this camaraderie that was built in the PT circle in the locker room,

396
00:41:11.64 --> 00:41:15.64
that then, of course, transitioned on to the, to the missions.

397
00:41:15.64 --> 00:41:20.64
And you would see guys in, in, you know, very tough situations, all said in crack joke.

398
00:41:20.64 --> 00:41:27.64
And that is, I think, the power of being in the team sometimes is, you, you build this,

399
00:41:27.64 --> 00:41:34.64
this, this level of teamwork with your, with your, with your swim buddies that is hard to replicate anywhere.

400
00:41:34.64 --> 00:41:40.64
And, and if there's one thing I miss, after retiring, many things, but that's the thing I miss the most.

401
00:41:40.64 --> 00:41:46.64
It's been around team guys, being harassed, harassing people back, and realizing that, I know harm no foul.

402
00:41:46.64 --> 00:41:49.64
You know, just, let's move on, that's fun.

403
00:41:49.64 --> 00:41:53.64
When you checked into UDT 11, what, what did you think you were going to be doing?

404
00:41:53.64 --> 00:42:01.64
So, just as a little backdrop, when I checked into CLT 11, in 1991, I thought I was going to nom.

405
00:42:01.64 --> 00:42:07.64
Oh, I can, my mind, I was like, hey, look, man, I know we don't know about this stuff, there's top secret stuff going on.

406
00:42:07.64 --> 00:42:11.64
I know, I'm probably going to nom or whatever, Cambodian, I'm going to do in sock missions.

407
00:42:11.64 --> 00:42:15.64
That's what I was thinking, because I was really young and really dumb.

408
00:42:15.64 --> 00:42:18.64
When you checked into UDT 11, what was it?

409
00:42:18.64 --> 00:42:21.64
1970, 1978, early 1970, yeah.

410
00:42:21.64 --> 00:42:23.64
What did you think you were going to be doing?

411
00:42:23.64 --> 00:42:24.64
Same thing.

412
00:42:24.64 --> 00:42:25.64
I mean, I'm on your hood.

413
00:42:25.64 --> 00:42:31.64
Well, back then, of course, we thought we were going to go back and rescue POWs out of the, or this was the cold war, kind of the higher the cold war.

414
00:42:31.64 --> 00:42:34.64
So, we thought we were going to be doing missions against the Soviet Union.

415
00:42:34.64 --> 00:42:40.64
And I don't think I mentioned the story in any of the books, but when I first got there, I was out,

416
00:42:40.64 --> 00:42:46.64
during a dive training dive one day, and one of the chiefs comes, grabs me, says, hey, sir, can any officer wants to see you?

417
00:42:46.64 --> 00:42:50.64
I mean, I'm an innocent, a painting officer, I mean, he's an important guy, and I thought, all right, this is it.

418
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:53.64
I mean, it's something important.

419
00:42:53.64 --> 00:42:56.64
So, I get up and he and I said, well, let me go back and change you.

420
00:42:56.64 --> 00:42:58.64
I was not, CO said just come, come as you are.

421
00:42:58.64 --> 00:43:03.64
I was in my shorty wetsuit, so I go up, going, wait outside the CO's office and the CO's assistant says,

422
00:43:03.64 --> 00:43:07.64
yeah, I go in and see him, and I admit the CO, but yeah, I mean, I was an innocent.

423
00:43:07.64 --> 00:43:09.64
He was the commanding officer.

424
00:43:09.64 --> 00:43:12.64
So, I come in and, he says, sense of the gravy, yeah, good to see you again.

425
00:43:12.64 --> 00:43:17.64
Yes, sir, he says, I've been hearing good things about you, and I'm thinking, yeah, okay.

426
00:43:17.64 --> 00:43:24.64
He says, he says, we got something important coming up, and, yeah, I need one of my best

427
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:25.64
in, so I'm going to run this thing.

428
00:43:25.64 --> 00:43:28.64
Yeah, this is the most important way to get to the point.

429
00:43:28.64 --> 00:43:33.64
Yeah, this is because, and he says, you know, the fourth of July is coming up, and we need somebody

430
00:43:33.64 --> 00:43:35.64
to be the frog float officer.

431
00:43:35.64 --> 00:43:38.64
And of course, I'm like, I'm sorry, sir, what?

432
00:43:38.64 --> 00:43:42.64
You guys, yeah, every fourth of July, we build a frog float to be in the corner

433
00:43:42.64 --> 00:43:48.64
out of parade, and I want you to be the frog float officer, and I was like, you have got to be kidding.

434
00:43:48.64 --> 00:43:52.64
But I remember when I came out, I kind of had this kind of hound dog look on my face, and there was

435
00:43:52.64 --> 00:43:54.64
a, I don't remember hercial Davis.

436
00:43:54.64 --> 00:43:58.64
Yeah, so hercial Davis was the commanding master, you've over at Sealtime, or under what

437
00:43:58.64 --> 00:44:02.64
of dimlas in team 12, and he sees you walking down, and I'm a little hand, you know,

438
00:44:02.64 --> 00:44:05.64
shoulders and how to go, what's wrong, that's a, that's a,

439
00:44:05.64 --> 00:44:08.64
master of he said, I said, I thought I was going to do some important.

440
00:44:08.64 --> 00:44:10.64
I'm going to be the frog float officer.

441
00:44:10.64 --> 00:44:15.64
And hercial said something said, well, then be the best damn frog float officer you can be.

442
00:44:15.64 --> 00:44:17.64
And I thought, well, that's it right there.

443
00:44:17.64 --> 00:44:22.64
Whatever it is, whether you're the frog float officer or plant and eel grass, which was another one we had to do.

444
00:44:22.64 --> 00:44:24.64
Do it the best you can.

445
00:44:24.64 --> 00:44:25.64
I'm a eel grass.

446
00:44:25.64 --> 00:44:26.64
Plant and eel grass.

447
00:44:26.64 --> 00:44:31.64
So the reason the Coronado San Diego Bay looks as good as it does, and as clean as it is, is because back in

448
00:44:31.64 --> 00:44:39.64
1978, UDT 12, UDT 11 and Sealtime 1, we all got out and planted eel grass under water.

449
00:44:39.64 --> 00:44:44.64
So the eel grass would grow to bring in the little fish used to clean out San Diego Bay.

450
00:44:44.64 --> 00:44:50.64
And it worked, but that was hours of diving at three feet under the water planting eel grass.

451
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:56.64
Yeah, I never did those missions to get the Soviet Union or to go back and a Vietnam.

452
00:44:56.64 --> 00:45:07.64
I was on my first deployment, so I get there, we deployed the Guam, and we shell up there, and they immediately have us do like a double duck insert.

453
00:45:07.64 --> 00:45:14.64
We go in, we hit a target, live fire, we come over to the beach, hit a target, live fire, we get done.

454
00:45:14.64 --> 00:45:17.64
We're all, you know, pretty, it's pretty cool.

455
00:45:17.64 --> 00:45:22.64
And then we go out the next day, we clean our weapons, we go out, they say, hey, you know, get your weapons cited in.

456
00:45:22.64 --> 00:45:27.64
Okay, you know, and of course same thing in my mind, I'm thinking we're getting ready for the big mesh.

457
00:45:27.64 --> 00:45:31.64
So we go out, we sight in our weapons, clean them, sight them in, get back.

458
00:45:31.64 --> 00:45:34.64
And then a couple days goes by and they give us pages too, right?

459
00:45:34.64 --> 00:45:40.64
It's back in the day, you know, you might as well just be, you know, it was just as crazy as it gets.

460
00:45:40.64 --> 00:45:47.64
So I got the page. Well, a couple days go by three days, four days go by and we're not getting the big recall.

461
00:45:47.64 --> 00:45:53.64
You know, I don't know if they're trying to negotiate with whoever the terrorist were that we're needed to die or whatever the case was.

462
00:45:53.64 --> 00:45:56.64
But also there was good waves. So I said, you know what?

463
00:45:56.64 --> 00:46:02.64
I told my, told my roommate, like a couple of us are going to go surfing, so we went down the Spanish steps and we were surfing.

464
00:46:02.64 --> 00:46:07.64
And all of a sudden I'm looking up on the cliffs and there's the guy that we told is up there waving his arms,

465
00:46:07.64 --> 00:46:11.64
frantically. And holy shit, right? We're getting recalled. This is it.

466
00:46:11.64 --> 00:46:15.64
So run in, run up the Spanish steps, grab, you know, hey, what's going on?

467
00:46:15.64 --> 00:46:19.64
So we got recalled. She'll as me as pageers got the 911 page.

468
00:46:19.64 --> 00:46:23.64
Damn, it's on. We get back, we get down to the Petune space.

469
00:46:23.64 --> 00:46:27.64
And, you know, the free con senior chief comes in and he says,

470
00:46:27.64 --> 00:46:30.64
Hey, you guys, you, you didn't clean up your brass, other.

471
00:46:30.64 --> 00:46:34.64
I'm the right, you said it in your weapons. You guys got to go clean up your breasts.

472
00:46:34.64 --> 00:46:41.64
So that was when I realized it maybe wasn't going to quite, I wasn't going to know him after all.

473
00:46:41.64 --> 00:46:45.64
How long were you, how long did you, UDT 11 then?

474
00:46:45.64 --> 00:46:46.64
Two years.

475
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:49.64
And did you, did you do a platoon there? Were you like an assistant platoon?

476
00:46:49.64 --> 00:46:53.64
I was an assistant platoon commander, Dave Tash, Lieutenant Dave Tash was a platoon commander.

477
00:46:53.64 --> 00:46:55.64
I was in the SDV platoon.

478
00:46:55.64 --> 00:47:00.64
So, you know, when I first got there, of course, thinking I was going to do real frogman stuff

479
00:47:00.64 --> 00:47:04.64
and being a regular underwater demolition team platoon, which was, as you know,

480
00:47:04.64 --> 00:47:06.64
this was about kind of clearing beaches and that sort of thing.

481
00:47:06.64 --> 00:47:10.64
And then I find out there are these things called back then Swimmer Delivery Vehicles

482
00:47:10.64 --> 00:47:16.64
now sealed delivery vehicles. And the first I was, I wasn't happy about being a sign to an SDV platoon.

483
00:47:16.64 --> 00:47:19.64
Turned out to be one of the best platoon I was ever in.

484
00:47:19.64 --> 00:47:23.64
It was just, it was real frogman stuff because we were doing, you know, six hour dives

485
00:47:23.64 --> 00:47:27.64
and are so for the, again, the listener in SDV is, you know,

486
00:47:27.64 --> 00:47:30.64
think about a man torpedo with a bit of a cowling on it.

487
00:47:30.64 --> 00:47:33.64
So you had a, we started off with what was called the Mark 7.

488
00:47:33.64 --> 00:47:36.64
So you had a pilot in the front and a navigator in the back.

489
00:47:36.64 --> 00:47:38.64
And you could squeeze two more guys in if you had to.

490
00:47:38.64 --> 00:47:40.64
And you could put some demolition in there.

491
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:42.64
And then they would launch off the bigger submarines.

492
00:47:42.64 --> 00:47:47.64
And then later we got the Mark 8, which was a bigger, sealed delivery vehicle.

493
00:47:47.64 --> 00:47:49.64
But it was all about diving.

494
00:47:49.64 --> 00:47:52.64
And you spent, you know, four days a week underwater.

495
00:47:52.64 --> 00:47:56.64
And an important thing to note about this, when you say many submarine,

496
00:47:56.64 --> 00:47:59.64
there's a key component that is not what you're thinking if you're listening to this.

497
00:47:59.64 --> 00:48:02.64
And that is it's a rather wet submersible.

498
00:48:02.64 --> 00:48:04.64
So you're not in this thing dry.

499
00:48:04.64 --> 00:48:08.64
You're diving while you're in a, you're basically on a motorcycle.

500
00:48:08.64 --> 00:48:10.64
Underwater underwater.

501
00:48:10.64 --> 00:48:11.64
Underwater.

502
00:48:11.64 --> 00:48:14.64
Yeah. So, so I was one of the primary pilots.

503
00:48:14.64 --> 00:48:18.64
And I, and I loved driving the SDV. And of course, you know,

504
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:19.64
some back here in Coronado, California.

505
00:48:19.64 --> 00:48:21.64
And I had a chance to go back.

506
00:48:21.64 --> 00:48:23.64
You relive those days where you were going under the bridge.

507
00:48:23.64 --> 00:48:26.64
And back then you had what was called an obstacle avoidance sonar.

508
00:48:26.64 --> 00:48:29.64
And the OAS as we referred to it.

509
00:48:29.64 --> 00:48:30.64
Yeah.

510
00:48:30.64 --> 00:48:32.64
The underwater obstacles were not real clear.

511
00:48:32.64 --> 00:48:36.64
You really had to have a good eye to be able to read the obstacle avoidance sonar.

512
00:48:36.64 --> 00:48:39.64
So the navigator would read the OAS.

513
00:48:39.64 --> 00:48:41.64
And it was this kind of green glow.

514
00:48:41.64 --> 00:48:44.64
And you'd have to pick out the pylons and the,

515
00:48:44.64 --> 00:48:48.64
and the ships coming at you underwater in this green glow.

516
00:48:48.64 --> 00:48:49.64
They've gotten much better today.

517
00:48:49.64 --> 00:48:51.64
But back then the technology just wasn't very good.

518
00:48:51.64 --> 00:48:54.64
So we tended to run into things every once in a while.

519
00:48:54.64 --> 00:48:57.64
You know, ships, the Coronado Bay Bridge.

520
00:48:57.64 --> 00:49:02.64
You know, and then you just, this fiberglass that you bring it back in.

521
00:49:02.64 --> 00:49:06.64
And the Master Chief who was our fiberglass guru would give me that look like

522
00:49:06.64 --> 00:49:08.64
I can't believe you ran into something again.

523
00:49:08.64 --> 00:49:10.64
He fixed up the fiberglass.

524
00:49:10.64 --> 00:49:11.64
You get back in the water.

525
00:49:11.64 --> 00:49:12.64
Did you go on a deployment?

526
00:49:12.64 --> 00:49:13.64
I did.

527
00:49:13.64 --> 00:49:13.64
Yeah.

528
00:49:13.64 --> 00:49:14.64
Did a first West back.

529
00:49:14.64 --> 00:49:15.64
So I went over to Subic Bay.

530
00:49:15.64 --> 00:49:18.64
That's where Naval Special Warfare Unit 1 was in Subic Bay at the time.

531
00:49:18.64 --> 00:49:22.64
And the USS Greyback, which was our Special Operations submarine.

532
00:49:22.64 --> 00:49:25.64
So the Greyback had these two big chambers on it.

533
00:49:25.64 --> 00:49:27.64
It used to launch Regulus missiles.

534
00:49:27.64 --> 00:49:31.64
And they had converted these chambers to be able to launch the,

535
00:49:31.64 --> 00:49:32.64
seal the liver vehicles.

536
00:49:32.64 --> 00:49:37.64
So we went out there and again, spent a lot of time under way on board the USS Greyback,

537
00:49:37.64 --> 00:49:39.64
conducting training operations.

538
00:49:39.64 --> 00:49:44.64
Once again, thinking we were going to go, you know, run against flat of OAS stock or something like that.

539
00:49:44.64 --> 00:49:47.64
So there was always, and you remember the time.

540
00:49:47.64 --> 00:49:54.64
When, when you were training, one of the things that always motivated you was, this could become a real world mission sometime.

541
00:49:54.64 --> 00:50:00.64
You know, if you ever got to the point where you were training and you didn't think that you were going to be able to take that training and apply it in more time,

542
00:50:00.64 --> 00:50:01.64
then I think it demotivated.

543
00:50:01.64 --> 00:50:07.64
But the fact matter is, every time we went out on training up, there was always this idea that we're going against the Soviets.

544
00:50:07.64 --> 00:50:11.64
Or, you know, we're going to go back and Vietnam and get the POWs that might still be there.

545
00:50:11.64 --> 00:50:15.64
Or, we're going to go do some, you know, some of the nation's bidding somewhere.

546
00:50:15.64 --> 00:50:19.64
And that always pushed you to do absolutely, you're very best on every single training mission.

547
00:50:19.64 --> 00:50:27.64
No matter how hard it was, even though it was a training up, you wanted to push it to the limits because you wanted to be ready for the real world up.

548
00:50:27.64 --> 00:50:34.64
Yeah, and there was also this, I don't know if it's a specter, but this belief that this real world mission,

549
00:50:34.64 --> 00:50:39.64
whatever it was going to be, since it was a little bit unknown, you didn't, you didn't know it.

550
00:50:39.64 --> 00:50:40.64
You didn't know what it was going to be.

551
00:50:40.64 --> 00:50:43.64
So it was always like I need to prepare even more.

552
00:50:43.64 --> 00:50:47.64
Even more, because we just don't even know how crazy it's going to be.

553
00:50:47.64 --> 00:50:48.64
Right.

554
00:50:48.64 --> 00:50:53.64
Then how long, so you did one deployment to this, to Suic Bay, and then you got done with that.

555
00:50:53.64 --> 00:50:56.64
And then you got, did you get stationed at Suic Bay, right?

556
00:50:56.64 --> 00:51:00.64
So yeah, so I had my first set of orders to the Naval Post graduate school.

557
00:51:00.64 --> 00:51:06.64
And I ended up having five sets of orders of which I didn't execute the first four of them because I got pulled out to go through something else.

558
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:12.64
But yeah, as soon as I got back, I just had made an impression, a good impression on the commanding officer out there in Suic.

559
00:51:12.64 --> 00:51:20.64
So I got back thinking I was going to go to a wonderful tour in Monterey, California, and as soon as I got back, the commanding officer says, hey, good news.

560
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:28.64
The commanding officer of Naval Special Warfare Unit 1 has asked for you by name, and you get to go to the Philippines for two years.

561
00:51:28.64 --> 00:51:31.64
And I thought, this is going to be tough.

562
00:51:31.64 --> 00:51:34.64
And once again, it turned out to be an absolutely fabulous tour.

563
00:51:34.64 --> 00:51:40.64
My wife and I went out there, my first child was all of a couple of months old at that time.

564
00:51:40.64 --> 00:51:44.64
And we worked hard in the Philippines, supporting the platoons that would deploy over.

565
00:51:44.64 --> 00:51:51.64
So back then, Unit 1 and the Philippines, the platoons from San Diego, would deploy out there that was kind of our home base,

566
00:51:51.64 --> 00:51:53.64
and then they would go from there to other places.

567
00:51:53.64 --> 00:51:55.64
But Unit 1 had the responsibility to support it.

568
00:51:55.64 --> 00:52:04.64
So I got there, I started off as the intelligence officer, and then, since it kind of became the utility infield or the training officer and a lot of other things.

569
00:52:04.64 --> 00:52:13.64
But it was a great group of guys out there, good mission, and life in the Philippines back then was a good time.

570
00:52:13.64 --> 00:52:20.64
You relay one of these training operations in the book Sea Stories that I would say left at Mark on you.

571
00:52:20.64 --> 00:52:23.64
You were basically running a training mission.

572
00:52:23.64 --> 00:52:26.64
You had a Marine Colonel that was playing the role of a hostage.

573
00:52:26.64 --> 00:52:32.64
So he was being held out in a jungle camp somewhere, and he's out there for a few days.

574
00:52:32.64 --> 00:52:37.64
And then the seal team, the seal platoon, gets the tasking to go out and rescue this guy.

575
00:52:37.64 --> 00:52:40.64
And it, well, it doesn't go well.

576
00:52:40.64 --> 00:52:44.64
They get compromised, and it sort of falls on its face.

577
00:52:44.64 --> 00:52:49.64
But the Marine Colonel, Colonel Brouse, how do you say his name?

578
00:52:49.64 --> 00:52:53.64
Colonel Brouse. He was like, hey, listen, we already did this much.

579
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:56.64
Let's continue to execute the rest of the plan, even though it wasn't great.

580
00:52:56.64 --> 00:52:57.64
Let's just continue doing it.

581
00:52:57.64 --> 00:53:02.64
So they, to finish the exercise, they had to move the Colonel to an extraction point,

582
00:53:02.64 --> 00:53:06.64
where he was going to get picked up by, by sea one, 30s, and then the sea one, 30s,

583
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:10.64
we're going to take them on a low level flight.

584
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:14.64
And, you know, you're, what do you, Lieutenant J.J. at this point?

585
00:53:14.64 --> 00:53:15.64
I'm a judge of you, right?

586
00:53:15.64 --> 00:53:20.64
You've had this, this Colonel out in the field for three, four days, and you say, hey, sir, you know,

587
00:53:20.64 --> 00:53:22.64
you don't, we can get you back to base.

588
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:24.64
And he's like, no, let's just get it done.

589
00:53:24.64 --> 00:53:27.64
Let's, let's do the whole thing.

590
00:53:27.64 --> 00:53:32.64
And a little more time goes by and you say, hey, sir, you know, you don't really need to get this plan.

591
00:53:32.64 --> 00:53:34.64
It's not going to be any training value for you.

592
00:53:34.64 --> 00:53:36.64
And he says, no, you know, we'll just do it.

593
00:53:36.64 --> 00:53:38.64
And he said, well, that's what a good leader does.

594
00:53:38.64 --> 00:53:42.64
So like, and they don't just, you know, bust out when things are going to get boring.

595
00:53:42.64 --> 00:53:45.64
But then there's another delay.

596
00:53:45.64 --> 00:53:50.64
The sea one, 30s that are supposed to pick them up are, they're late, they're delayed.

597
00:53:50.64 --> 00:53:57.64
And finally delayed multiple times. And finally, you say, you know, hey, sir, like, we don't know when this is going to happen.

598
00:53:57.64 --> 00:54:00.64
Why don't you just, you know, you and I will go look it out of here.

599
00:54:00.64 --> 00:54:02.64
You can go in the end. And of course, he's a Colonel.

600
00:54:02.64 --> 00:54:03.64
He's got stuff to do. He's got work to do.

601
00:54:03.64 --> 00:54:05.64
So he knows that too.

602
00:54:05.64 --> 00:54:07.64
So finally, he says, look, you know what, you're right.

603
00:54:07.64 --> 00:54:09.64
I got to get back to work.

604
00:54:09.64 --> 00:54:11.64
And so he doesn't get on the sea one, 30.

605
00:54:11.64 --> 00:54:13.64
You don't get on the sea one, 30.

606
00:54:13.64 --> 00:54:22.64
So he's got a bunch of Americans, Australians, New Zealand, some Filipinos on there.

607
00:54:22.64 --> 00:54:25.64
And I'm just going to go to the book here.

608
00:54:25.64 --> 00:54:27.64
Browse, that's the Colonel.

609
00:54:27.64 --> 00:54:29.64
Browse and I returned to a waiting Jeep.

610
00:54:29.64 --> 00:54:30.64
I shook his hand.

611
00:54:30.64 --> 00:54:36.64
Thank you for helping out with the exercise and watched a young pediosterat escort him back to Subic.

612
00:54:36.64 --> 00:54:37.64
Exhausted.

613
00:54:37.64 --> 00:54:39.64
I jumped in another Jeep and drove home.

614
00:54:39.64 --> 00:54:41.64
It had been a long couple of days.

615
00:54:41.64 --> 00:54:45.64
Half an hour later, aboard the MC 130, call sign stray 59.

616
00:54:45.64 --> 00:54:47.64
The pilot checked his instruments.

617
00:54:47.64 --> 00:54:52.64
Like the rest of us, the preceding days for him and his crew had been long and tiring.

618
00:54:52.64 --> 00:54:57.64
Adjusting his night vision goggles, he could see the water just a few feet below him.

619
00:54:57.64 --> 00:55:00.64
The water was closer than expected.

620
00:55:00.64 --> 00:55:02.64
Too close to recover.

621
00:55:02.64 --> 00:55:05.64
The tip of the left wing caught the top of a small wave.

622
00:55:05.64 --> 00:55:09.64
And in an instant, the plane tumbled forward, exploding in a few injected ball of flame

623
00:55:09.64 --> 00:55:13.64
as it violently ripped apart from the impact of the aircraft and the sea.

624
00:55:13.64 --> 00:55:21.64
Of the 24 men aboard, eight crew members and 16 passengers from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines,

625
00:55:21.64 --> 00:55:25.64
all but one Air Force first lieutenant Jeffrey A.

626
00:55:25.64 --> 00:55:28.64
Blom died in the crash.

627
00:55:28.64 --> 00:55:34.64
Life in the sealed teams always seems to revolve around fate or destiny or the hand of God.

628
00:55:34.64 --> 00:55:36.64
Why do some men live and others die?

629
00:55:36.64 --> 00:55:38.64
Why were some men saved that day?

630
00:55:38.64 --> 00:55:41.64
Did God have a different plan for us?

631
00:55:41.64 --> 00:55:44.64
What about the crew and passengers of stray 59?

632
00:55:44.64 --> 00:55:48.64
Surely their families would have wanted them longer in their lives?

633
00:55:48.64 --> 00:55:55.64
They were all brave and honorable men, all worthy of a full and prosperous life.

634
00:55:55.64 --> 00:55:57.64
I think about them often.

635
00:55:57.64 --> 00:56:01.64
20 years later, as I rose to the rank of Admiral and Coment,

636
00:56:01.64 --> 00:56:07.64
and combat in Iraq and Afghanistan became a daily activity, I thought a lot about stray 59.

637
00:56:07.64 --> 00:56:15.64
The role of the MC-130s and their sister aircraft, the AC-130s, became more and more important to our special operations missions.

638
00:56:15.64 --> 00:56:23.64
With every plan I reviewed and every plan I approved, I asked myself silently whether the risk to the crew and the aircraft was worth the reward.

639
00:56:23.64 --> 00:56:32.64
I can only hope that the sacrifice of the men aboard stray 59 saved lives, lives of men and women who have no idea that their destiny rested

640
00:56:32.64 --> 00:56:38.64
with a plane that took off from QB airfield in 1981 and never returned.

641
00:56:38.64 --> 00:56:41.64
May God rest at their souls.

642
00:56:41.64 --> 00:56:59.64
That means real world missions and regular missions in the military.

643
00:56:59.64 --> 00:57:02.64
There's always some level of risk.

644
00:57:02.64 --> 00:57:13.64
Yeah, and as you well know, there are times when you go left and right and it makes a difference between life and death.

645
00:57:13.64 --> 00:57:20.64
You make one decision and it changes the lives of dozens of men and women.

646
00:57:20.64 --> 00:57:23.64
And this is the nature of life in the teams.

647
00:57:23.64 --> 00:57:29.64
I think back over those 37 years and I've written about a few of them in the book, but there were more of them.

648
00:57:29.64 --> 00:57:34.64
And you've been there where all of a sudden you have this near-death experience.

649
00:57:34.64 --> 00:57:42.64
The parachute doesn't get blown up by one of your hundred things, but it doesn't happen.

650
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:44.64
You manage to get through it.

651
00:57:44.64 --> 00:57:50.64
Or it happens and it's over and you've survived and you don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.

652
00:57:50.64 --> 00:57:53.64
You're like, okay, well the reserve opened, that's good.

653
00:57:53.64 --> 00:57:58.64
Or the guy fired an inch from me and said, hey, that's good.

654
00:57:58.64 --> 00:58:03.64
And that's that becomes almost a daily, weekly, monthly occurrence.

655
00:58:03.64 --> 00:58:06.64
And you just learn to compartmentalize you learn to live with it.

656
00:58:06.64 --> 00:58:09.64
But there was something about Strafe 59.

657
00:58:09.64 --> 00:58:12.64
It was obviously the magnitude of the crash.

658
00:58:12.64 --> 00:58:19.64
And just the fact that as you read it so beautifully there, you know, I had asked the Colonel three times.

659
00:58:19.64 --> 00:58:22.64
Because again, he was an important guy. He was in charge of the officer of the provost.

660
00:58:22.64 --> 00:58:26.64
And he was a senior Marine there at Sybiki, a great guy.

661
00:58:26.64 --> 00:58:31.64
And I had kind of encouraged him to be this hostage.

662
00:58:31.64 --> 00:58:34.64
And so in the course of the day, which was relationship building.

663
00:58:34.64 --> 00:58:35.64
Which was a relationship building.

664
00:58:35.64 --> 00:58:36.64
Which was a relationship building.

665
00:58:36.64 --> 00:58:37.64
What was the deal?

666
00:58:37.64 --> 00:58:39.64
How could we were and then things didn't go well.

667
00:58:39.64 --> 00:58:42.64
But we were actually on the ramp of the C130.

668
00:58:42.64 --> 00:58:44.64
As we were getting ready the third time.

669
00:58:44.64 --> 00:58:50.64
And I knew, you know, you've been on these flights, you know, the C130, you know, the low-level terrain following is,

670
00:58:50.64 --> 00:58:52.64
I mean, it's a vomit rocket.

671
00:58:52.64 --> 00:58:56.64
It's something down. And some guys don't handle it very well.

672
00:58:56.64 --> 00:58:58.64
And I thought, you know, we're going to do that for three and a half hours.

673
00:58:58.64 --> 00:58:59.64
Does it really need to do that?

674
00:58:59.64 --> 00:59:01.64
And it wasn't until we were actually staying on the ramp.

675
00:59:01.64 --> 00:59:04.64
And he says, yeah, okay, let's go.

676
00:59:04.64 --> 00:59:07.64
And then of course, I got the call about an hour or so later.

677
00:59:07.64 --> 00:59:11.64
We had to remuster in the compound there at Naval Special War for you.

678
00:59:11.64 --> 00:59:12.64
And I didn't know why.

679
00:59:12.64 --> 00:59:16.64
And of course, they were trying to get a headcount to find out who was still alive.

680
00:59:16.64 --> 00:59:19.64
And you have a lot of those in the course of your career.

681
00:59:19.64 --> 00:59:22.64
And you hope you learn from them. And as I pointed out in the book,

682
00:59:22.64 --> 00:59:26.64
then when I was in a position of command, you know, from the time I was the commander of

683
00:59:26.64 --> 00:59:29.64
Seal Team 3 or the Commodore or certainly my time after 9-11,

684
00:59:29.64 --> 00:59:31.64
you're reviewing these missions.

685
00:59:31.64 --> 00:59:37.64
And particularly with the MC-130s and the AC-130s, because, you know, in combat the guy, they want to push the envelope.

686
00:59:37.64 --> 00:59:39.64
It's okay to push the envelope.

687
00:59:39.64 --> 00:59:42.64
But only if the reward is worth the risk.

688
00:59:42.64 --> 00:59:47.64
Because, you know, I wanted to make, and it wasn't just the C130s.

689
00:59:47.64 --> 00:59:52.64
I mean, I, the helicopter pilots, I remember one point in time after not my unit,

690
00:59:52.64 --> 00:59:56.64
but another unit had lost a heel-o and a couple seals had been on board.

691
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:00.64
But the mission they were running, I thought, was a little too high risk.

692
01:00:00.64 --> 01:00:03.64
I pulled all the war in officers in that were flying for me.

693
01:00:03.64 --> 01:00:05.64
And I said, when I'm going to do that, here's the deal.

694
01:00:05.64 --> 01:00:11.64
If I find out that you take off on a mission that is red, I'm going to fire your ass and

695
01:00:11.64 --> 01:00:12.64
send you back to the States.

696
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:15.64
You ought to start off every mission in the green.

697
01:00:15.64 --> 01:00:18.64
In other words, you ought to have planned it to reduce the risk as much as possible.

698
01:00:18.64 --> 01:00:21.64
If it's a really important mission, maybe I'll let you start off in the amber,

699
01:00:21.64 --> 01:00:23.64
but we're going to have that conversation.

700
01:00:23.64 --> 01:00:26.64
But we are not going to start off the mission in the red.

701
01:00:26.64 --> 01:00:27.64
It ain't worth it.

702
01:00:27.64 --> 01:00:30.64
If you think the shadow governor of pickup province is worth it,

703
01:00:30.64 --> 01:00:31.64
he's not.

704
01:00:31.64 --> 01:00:33.64
We'll come back and get him tomorrow.

705
01:00:33.64 --> 01:00:37.64
And I didn't know how that would be received by the pilots, because, you know,

706
01:00:37.64 --> 01:00:42.64
I mean, I was, you know, when you start losing guys and losing helicopters,

707
01:00:42.64 --> 01:00:44.64
you know, you really want to make sure you're doing things the right way,

708
01:00:44.64 --> 01:00:47.64
because you don't want to lose any more men if you don't have to.

709
01:00:47.64 --> 01:00:50.64
And afterwards, I had a couple of the old salty, you know,

710
01:00:50.64 --> 01:00:53.64
warrants come up to me and they were appreciative of the fact that,

711
01:00:53.64 --> 01:00:54.64
hey, here's the line.

712
01:00:54.64 --> 01:00:55.64
We are not going to do this.

713
01:00:55.64 --> 01:00:57.64
Now again, missions may go in the red.

714
01:00:57.64 --> 01:00:58.64
I got it.

715
01:00:58.64 --> 01:01:00.64
But let's not start off in the red.

716
01:01:00.64 --> 01:01:02.64
Let's not build, you know, risk into the mission.

717
01:01:02.64 --> 01:01:05.64
And I think a lot of that goes back to Stray 59,

718
01:01:05.64 --> 01:01:07.64
to realizing that the, you know, lives are on the line,

719
01:01:07.64 --> 01:01:11.64
particularly in these, these aircraft and the helos and everything else

720
01:01:11.64 --> 01:01:12.64
we fly around it.

721
01:01:12.64 --> 01:01:16.64
But the interesting thing, so when I, when I wrote this,

722
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:18.64
I had no idea where Colonel Brous was.

723
01:01:18.64 --> 01:01:21.64
Didn't, I assumed he had passed away long since and,

724
01:01:21.64 --> 01:01:25.64
and frankly, the last time I saw him was probably a few years after,

725
01:01:25.64 --> 01:01:28.64
uh, it's probably in the mid 80s.

726
01:01:28.64 --> 01:01:31.64
Well, I get an email from his son,

727
01:01:31.64 --> 01:01:35.64
who had read the book, and he says, hey, sir,

728
01:01:35.64 --> 01:01:39.64
my father still live and, and I'd like to send him a copy of this book.

729
01:01:39.64 --> 01:01:42.64
So, uh, I reach out to talk to Colonel Brous.

730
01:01:42.64 --> 01:01:44.64
He and his wife are, I mean, he's in his 90s.

731
01:01:44.64 --> 01:01:46.64
Sharp as he can be.

732
01:01:46.64 --> 01:01:48.64
And, uh, and he remembered the story.

733
01:01:48.64 --> 01:01:49.64
And again, you're always pleased.

734
01:01:49.64 --> 01:01:54.64
You remember the story exactly as I, as I presented in the book.

735
01:01:54.64 --> 01:01:58.64
And, uh, but, uh, but he also remembered the fact that, uh,

736
01:01:58.64 --> 01:02:00.64
his life changed that day.

737
01:02:00.64 --> 01:02:03.64
And, and that had a, had a, had a big impact on him as well.

738
01:02:03.64 --> 01:02:05.64
And he was a combat veteran from,

739
01:02:05.64 --> 01:02:06.64
from Vietnam.

740
01:02:06.64 --> 01:02:09.64
Vietnam Vietnam. Oh, yeah. Yeah, heavily decorated.

741
01:02:09.64 --> 01:02:12.64
Um, yeah, I mean, he was a, a hard charge in this was,

742
01:02:12.64 --> 01:02:14.64
and this was not an admin marine.

743
01:02:14.64 --> 01:02:17.64
This was a, a hell of a combat vet. Yeah.

744
01:02:17.64 --> 01:02:21.64
Well, note, if you're out there listening, um, Colonel Brous, open invite.

745
01:02:21.64 --> 01:02:24.64
If you want to come on here and talk about your experiences,

746
01:02:24.64 --> 01:02:28.64
um, I'm, I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

747
01:02:28.64 --> 01:02:31.64
Uh, going, I'm going to go to the book,

748
01:02:31.64 --> 01:02:33.64
make your bed again,

749
01:02:33.64 --> 01:02:37.64
going to July 1983.

750
01:02:37.64 --> 01:02:38.64
Here we go.

751
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:41.64
July 1983 was at one of those tough moments.

752
01:02:41.64 --> 01:02:44.64
As I stood before the commanding officer,

753
01:02:44.64 --> 01:02:48.64
I thought my career as a Navy seal was over.

754
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:51.64
I just been relieved of my seal squadron,

755
01:02:51.64 --> 01:02:55.64
fired for trying to change the way my squadron was organized,

756
01:02:55.64 --> 01:02:57.64
trained and conducted missions.

757
01:02:57.64 --> 01:03:00.64
There were some magnificent officers and enlisted men in the organization,

758
01:03:00.64 --> 01:03:03.64
some of the most professional warriors I had ever been around.

759
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:06.64
However, much of the culture was still rooted in the Vietnam era,

760
01:03:06.64 --> 01:03:09.64
and I thought that it was time for a change.

761
01:03:09.64 --> 01:03:12.64
As I was to find out, change is never easy,

762
01:03:12.64 --> 01:03:15.64
particularly for the person in charge.

763
01:03:15.64 --> 01:03:17.64
Fortunately, even though I was fired,

764
01:03:17.64 --> 01:03:20.64
my commanding officer allowed me to transfer to another seal team,

765
01:03:20.64 --> 01:03:24.64
but my reputation as a seal officer was severely damaged.

766
01:03:24.64 --> 01:03:28.64
Everywhere I went, other officers and enlisted men knew I had failed,

767
01:03:28.64 --> 01:03:31.64
and every day there were whispers and subtle reminders

768
01:03:31.64 --> 01:03:34.64
that maybe I wasn't up to the task of being a seal.

769
01:03:34.64 --> 01:03:37.64
At that point in my career, I had two options,

770
01:03:37.64 --> 01:03:39.64
quit and move on to civilian life,

771
01:03:39.64 --> 01:03:44.64
which seemed like the logical choice in the light of my recent officer fitness report,

772
01:03:44.64 --> 01:03:48.64
or whether the storm and prove to others and myself,

773
01:03:48.64 --> 01:03:51.64
that I was a good seal officer.

774
01:03:51.64 --> 01:03:54.64
I chose the latter.

775
01:03:54.64 --> 01:03:59.64
So, here you are, want to be a good seal,

776
01:03:59.64 --> 01:04:04.64
and you tried to implement some changes.

777
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:07.64
You, I guess, swam against the stream.

778
01:04:07.64 --> 01:04:10.64
When you look back at that, this is a subject

779
01:04:10.64 --> 01:04:12.64
that I've talked about a lot,

780
01:04:12.64 --> 01:04:16.64
because there's a book called About Face by Colonel David Hackworth,

781
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:19.64
and at the end of the Vietnam War,

782
01:04:19.64 --> 01:04:23.64
he went on a TV program called Issues and Answers,

783
01:04:23.64 --> 01:04:26.64
and then said, we're going to lose this war if we don't change the way we're fighting it,

784
01:04:26.64 --> 01:04:29.64
and he was drawn down to the army in another couple of months,

785
01:04:29.64 --> 01:04:32.64
and my debate is always, you know,

786
01:04:32.64 --> 01:04:35.64
he was a golden child in the army at that point,

787
01:04:35.64 --> 01:04:39.64
and would have absolutely been up for brigade command and division command,

788
01:04:39.64 --> 01:04:41.64
and he would have been in charge of tens of thousands,

789
01:04:41.64 --> 01:04:48.64
if not more, and could have really influenced the way the war was fought.

790
01:04:48.64 --> 01:04:52.64
But he spoke up, and, you know, that was it.

791
01:04:52.64 --> 01:04:55.64
He made some enemies, and because people, you know,

792
01:04:55.64 --> 01:04:57.64
and I work with a lot of businesses, and people this happens in business,

793
01:04:57.64 --> 01:05:02.64
where people, they want to speak up, they see something that maybe could be done better, different.

794
01:05:02.64 --> 01:05:05.64
And of course, there's always a particular line that I make.

795
01:05:05.64 --> 01:05:08.64
Look, if someone's doing something that's illegal, immoral, or unethical,

796
01:05:08.64 --> 01:05:10.64
okay, we're not doing that, we got it.

797
01:05:10.64 --> 01:05:15.64
But a lot of times, and I wrote about this in leadership strategy and tactics,

798
01:05:15.64 --> 01:05:18.64
I called it conformed to influence, because when I was in my first seal,

799
01:05:18.64 --> 01:05:22.64
I was, I wanted to be a hardcore, and so it was mean.

800
01:05:22.64 --> 01:05:27.64
I was wearing a rock sack on the O-Course, and wearing a rock sack out on the runs,

801
01:05:27.64 --> 01:05:32.64
and I was a new guy, and I thought I was being cool, and, and hard,

802
01:05:32.64 --> 01:05:34.64
and getting ready for war.

803
01:05:34.64 --> 01:05:37.64
But my platoon was kind of looking at me like, you know,

804
01:05:37.64 --> 01:05:40.64
who do you think you are, you're truly trying to prove, hey, Rambo,

805
01:05:40.64 --> 01:05:44.64
and I realized, oh, I need to be a part of this team,

806
01:05:44.64 --> 01:05:46.64
if I'm going to have influence over them.

807
01:05:46.64 --> 01:05:49.64
Do I want them to train harder? Yeah, I do, absolutely.

808
01:05:49.64 --> 01:05:52.64
But if they don't like me, if I'm not part of the team,

809
01:05:52.64 --> 01:05:54.64
they're not going to listen to anything I say, as a matter of fact,

810
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:56.64
I'm ostracizing myself.

811
01:05:56.64 --> 01:06:00.64
So I know this is a, it seems like you went through this situation

812
01:06:00.64 --> 01:06:04.64
where, you know, you held up your hand and made a call,

813
01:06:04.64 --> 01:06:06.64
I'm going to go in this direction, and I think we should go in this direction,

814
01:06:06.64 --> 01:06:09.64
and didn't work out.

815
01:06:09.64 --> 01:06:13.64
The other part of this is I always say,

816
01:06:13.64 --> 01:06:16.64
if you're doing the right things for the right reasons,

817
01:06:16.64 --> 01:06:18.64
you'll win in the end.

818
01:06:18.64 --> 01:06:23.64
But it sometimes can take a long time before you, you quote,

819
01:06:23.64 --> 01:06:27.64
win, and you might take some tactical losses along the way,

820
01:06:27.64 --> 01:06:29.64
but if you're doing the right things for the right reasons,

821
01:06:29.64 --> 01:06:31.64
eventually things should go your way.

822
01:06:31.64 --> 01:06:34.64
When you reflect on on whatever went down at that command,

823
01:06:34.64 --> 01:06:38.64
and the way it turned out, what did you learn from it?

824
01:06:38.64 --> 01:06:40.64
Yeah, I learned a lot from it, actually.

825
01:06:40.64 --> 01:06:44.64
And it all, I think, positively influenced me over the years.

826
01:06:44.64 --> 01:06:46.64
First, I didn't make all the right calls.

827
01:06:46.64 --> 01:06:47.64
I mean, there's no question about it.

828
01:06:47.64 --> 01:06:50.64
I could have been a better officer, and, you know,

829
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:53.64
at the end of the day, the commanding officer has the right to decide

830
01:06:53.64 --> 01:06:57.64
who he thinks is going to be leading his potions, his squadrons,

831
01:06:57.64 --> 01:07:01.64
and I've never really faulted the CO for making that decision.

832
01:07:01.64 --> 01:07:03.64
I realized I could have done things better.

833
01:07:03.64 --> 01:07:05.64
The command could have done things better,

834
01:07:05.64 --> 01:07:09.64
but to your point, I, part of what I learned was,

835
01:07:09.64 --> 01:07:14.64
I didn't conform, I think, the way that they had hoped I would conform.

836
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:17.64
And part of it was, it just wasn't me.

837
01:07:17.64 --> 01:07:20.64
It wasn't a good cultural fit for me at the time.

838
01:07:20.64 --> 01:07:24.64
But, but I think you nailed it when you said,

839
01:07:24.64 --> 01:07:28.64
you know, there are times if you're going to influence the people that work with you,

840
01:07:28.64 --> 01:07:32.64
better do it from inside the wire than outside the wire sort of thing.

841
01:07:32.64 --> 01:07:36.64
Now, again, back to the, it's got to be more illegal in ethical.

842
01:07:36.64 --> 01:07:42.64
But, but what I also learned was, you know, you're going to have these rough times in the team,

843
01:07:42.64 --> 01:07:44.64
so anywhere you go.

844
01:07:44.64 --> 01:07:47.64
But, but that day I went home and I remember thinking,

845
01:07:47.64 --> 01:07:50.64
and I said, I don't know if I got a career left here.

846
01:07:50.64 --> 01:07:54.64
And, I had a long life, and I've been married at that point in time.

847
01:07:54.64 --> 01:07:57.64
You know, five, six years, something like that.

848
01:07:57.64 --> 01:08:00.64
And I came home and I said, yeah, I'm not sure what I should do.

849
01:08:00.64 --> 01:08:03.64
And she said, look, you've never quit it anything in your life.

850
01:08:03.64 --> 01:08:07.64
Don't start now. And, you know, best advice I could have had.

851
01:08:07.64 --> 01:08:10.64
And, of course, you got to weather the storm, because fortunately, the commanding officer,

852
01:08:10.64 --> 01:08:12.64
I mean, my paper wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.

853
01:08:12.64 --> 01:08:15.64
I mean, he didn't crush me and my fitness report.

854
01:08:15.64 --> 01:08:18.64
I was picked up by another team right after that,

855
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:21.64
who the commanding officer kind of gave me a second chance.

856
01:08:21.64 --> 01:08:24.64
I made the best of that second chance.

857
01:08:24.64 --> 01:08:29.64
But, you know, I go to a new team and, of course, the guys know.

858
01:08:29.64 --> 01:08:33.64
The rep, the rep you say, something, if you don't know, and the seal teams and life,

859
01:08:33.64 --> 01:08:36.64
but in the seal teams, it's like multiplied it in tents, if I do.

860
01:08:36.64 --> 01:08:39.64
The reputation is so powerful.

861
01:08:39.64 --> 01:08:44.64
And, I mean, there's guys that make a mistake when they show up as a new guy.

862
01:08:44.64 --> 01:08:49.64
And 25 years later, they retire, and their nickname is still based on the fact that they did something stupid.

863
01:08:49.64 --> 01:08:50.64
It's a new guy.

864
01:08:50.64 --> 01:08:51.64
Everybody knows that.

865
01:08:51.64 --> 01:08:53.64
That's when you meet them, that's their name.

866
01:08:53.64 --> 01:08:58.64
Is whatever done thing they did when they were a new guy, when they were 18 or 19 years old.

867
01:08:58.64 --> 01:09:02.64
Well, and this was, you know, so there was kind of the Skrissper campaign,

868
01:09:02.64 --> 01:09:07.64
well, I got to the new team and you understand that and you realize, hey, I got a prudent wrong.

869
01:09:07.64 --> 01:09:12.64
I've got to prove that I'm a good officer and so fortunately soon after I got to the command,

870
01:09:12.64 --> 01:09:13.64
I went on a deployment.

871
01:09:13.64 --> 01:09:15.64
It was a good deployment.

872
01:09:15.64 --> 01:09:16.64
I did well at the command.

873
01:09:16.64 --> 01:09:20.64
I went on to another command and then, you know, you begin to rebuild your reputation

874
01:09:20.64 --> 01:09:23.64
and frankly never looked back after that.

875
01:09:23.64 --> 01:09:27.64
But what it also helped me do was when I got into command.

876
01:09:27.64 --> 01:09:31.64
And all of my command tours thereafter.

877
01:09:31.64 --> 01:09:35.64
When I saw somebody that made a mistake, when I saw somebody that screwed up,

878
01:09:35.64 --> 01:09:38.64
you want to find an opportunity if they're a good officer, a good-enlisted,

879
01:09:38.64 --> 01:09:40.64
to give them that second chance.

880
01:09:40.64 --> 01:09:44.64
So that they aren't branded with, you know, a bad reputation.

881
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:49.64
You put them in a position to be successful to get over whatever that fall

882
01:09:49.64 --> 01:09:51.64
through that failure might have been.

883
01:09:51.64 --> 01:09:56.64
And I was fortunate to have an officer named John Sandos who picked me up at Seal Team 4.

884
01:09:56.64 --> 01:10:00.64
You know, took me under his wing and said, hey, I remember you from my time at the West Coast

885
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:02.64
and let's get back to work.

886
01:10:02.64 --> 01:10:07.64
And again, that kind of quickly got me over the hump and then, you never looked back.

887
01:10:07.64 --> 01:10:12.64
So, you know, when you have the opportunity and leadership position to help somebody out

888
01:10:12.64 --> 01:10:17.64
to give them that second chance to put them on the path to be better than what they were.

889
01:10:17.64 --> 01:10:19.64
You take that opportunity.

890
01:10:19.64 --> 01:10:24.64
How freaking crazy-obsessive were you to do a good job when you got the team 4?

891
01:10:24.64 --> 01:10:27.64
I mean, I can't even imagine if I was in that situation,

892
01:10:27.64 --> 01:10:31.64
I was already crazy on trying to do a good job, you know?

893
01:10:31.64 --> 01:10:35.64
I keep you must have been just a full bore, like your wife must have said,

894
01:10:35.64 --> 01:10:38.64
after another three months, she must have said, maybe you should quit.

895
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:42.64
There was a lot of that, but you also realized you can't overreact.

896
01:10:42.64 --> 01:10:47.64
And I think when I got in there at first, I would see things people, you know,

897
01:10:47.64 --> 01:10:52.64
that I thought were sliding me and initially I kind of react to it because I was overly sensitive

898
01:10:52.64 --> 01:10:55.64
to it when it was just team guys being team guys.

899
01:10:55.64 --> 01:10:57.64
You know, back to the PT circle, you know, you think,

900
01:10:57.64 --> 01:10:59.64
was there something hidden in that?

901
01:10:59.64 --> 01:11:01.64
And there wasn't.

902
01:11:01.64 --> 01:11:06.64
And so, you got to kind of get over that and find that balance that goes, okay,

903
01:11:06.64 --> 01:11:08.64
like, yeah, you're going to get harassed.

904
01:11:08.64 --> 01:11:12.64
That's part of being in the teams, enjoy the good nature of harassment,

905
01:11:12.64 --> 01:11:15.64
and don't take it so personal every time.

906
01:11:15.64 --> 01:11:20.64
But to your point, probably took me a while to get over that.

907
01:11:20.64 --> 01:11:23.64
I think I had to get past the deployment.

908
01:11:23.64 --> 01:11:25.64
And then my next job is as the ops officer,

909
01:11:25.64 --> 01:11:29.64
I sealed the liver vehicle team too, and I had a great bunch of guys there.

910
01:11:29.64 --> 01:11:32.64
And again, everything went well, never looked back.

911
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:34.64
What did you do for a deployment at team four?

912
01:11:34.64 --> 01:11:37.64
So I went down to South America, to the unit of the officers.

913
01:11:37.64 --> 01:11:41.64
And had a great opportunity and the thing about it was, I mean,

914
01:11:41.64 --> 01:11:44.64
we just, you know, you kind of lived off the land back then.

915
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:46.64
We weren't as sophisticated, we didn't kind of have the money.

916
01:11:46.64 --> 01:11:48.64
So we parachuted into Columbia.

917
01:11:48.64 --> 01:11:52.64
Yeah, spent three weeks in some, you know, back part of Columbia,

918
01:11:52.64 --> 01:11:56.64
where most of the day we were forging for food.

919
01:11:56.64 --> 01:11:59.64
So, you know, we were looking for drinkable water.

920
01:11:59.64 --> 01:12:02.64
I had to send, you know, a couple of guys to go to the market to get food,

921
01:12:02.64 --> 01:12:06.64
because we didn't back then, yes, you could have brought sea rats as we refer to them.

922
01:12:06.64 --> 01:12:08.64
The MREs of today.

923
01:12:08.64 --> 01:12:09.64
But those were heavy.

924
01:12:09.64 --> 01:12:10.64
Those were big boxes.

925
01:12:10.64 --> 01:12:11.64
We didn't want to be carrying that around.

926
01:12:11.64 --> 01:12:14.64
So, you know, a couple of guys would be assigned child duty,

927
01:12:14.64 --> 01:12:17.64
while the rest of the team went out and worked with the Buzotactico.

928
01:12:17.64 --> 01:12:18.64
So, the Colombians.

929
01:12:18.64 --> 01:12:23.64
And then we went from there to Ecuador to Peru to Chile to Brazil.

930
01:12:23.64 --> 01:12:25.64
I mean, it was a great planet.

931
01:12:25.64 --> 01:12:27.64
So, I think you did, um,

932
01:12:27.64 --> 01:12:30.64
ops officer at SDV team too.

933
01:12:30.64 --> 01:12:31.64
Right.

934
01:12:31.64 --> 01:12:35.64
And then from you there, 1989, you're the, you're the exo, it's the old team one.

935
01:12:35.64 --> 01:12:37.64
Yeah, so from from SDV team,

936
01:12:37.64 --> 01:12:39.64
you know, when I've been gone for two and a half years.

937
01:12:39.64 --> 01:12:40.64
Okay.

938
01:12:40.64 --> 01:12:44.64
And, you know, every operator goes kicking the screen into an admin job.

939
01:12:44.64 --> 01:12:50.64
Um, but this one actually probably set me up for success much more so than I would have thought,

940
01:12:50.64 --> 01:12:52.64
because you get into the Pentagon.

941
01:12:52.64 --> 01:12:57.64
And this was at a time when again, the seals we worked for the surface warfare guys.

942
01:12:57.64 --> 01:12:59.64
Um, the ship drivers.

943
01:12:59.64 --> 01:13:02.64
And we worked in what was called Oppo 3 in the Pentagon.

944
01:13:02.64 --> 01:13:07.64
But it was there where all the money that the seals got for beans, bullets, bodies, buildings,

945
01:13:07.64 --> 01:13:09.64
you name it, came through the Pentagon.

946
01:13:09.64 --> 01:13:13.64
So, I learned, I was a Lieutenant made Lieutenant Commander there.

947
01:13:13.64 --> 01:13:16.64
And I learned how to work the system.

948
01:13:16.64 --> 01:13:19.64
How to get manpower in a seal team.

949
01:13:19.64 --> 01:13:21.64
How to get buildings built.

950
01:13:21.64 --> 01:13:23.64
How to get money for more ammunition.

951
01:13:23.64 --> 01:13:26.64
None of my contemporaries had that experience.

952
01:13:26.64 --> 01:13:28.64
So when I left, um, the Pentagon,

953
01:13:28.64 --> 01:13:33.64
and then went off to be the executive officer at seal team one, uh, in 1988.

954
01:13:33.64 --> 01:13:38.64
Um, I mean, as the exo, uh, nobody could keep up because the seal was saying,

955
01:13:38.64 --> 01:13:40.64
hey, can we get some more body sir?

956
01:13:40.64 --> 01:13:41.64
Yes sir, I know how to do that.

957
01:13:41.64 --> 01:13:48.64
You know, and, uh, and so understanding the resourcing end of it, uh, you know,

958
01:13:48.64 --> 01:13:49.64
major good staff officer.

959
01:13:49.64 --> 01:13:51.64
No seal wants to have that monochron.

960
01:13:51.64 --> 01:13:53.64
You know, you're a good staff officer.

961
01:13:53.64 --> 01:13:56.64
But at the end of the day, the good staff officers are what allow the team guys,

962
01:13:56.64 --> 01:13:59.64
the operators to have the equipment they need and, uh,

963
01:13:59.64 --> 01:14:02.64
you know, the money to go through the training and that sort of thing.

964
01:14:02.64 --> 01:14:06.64
Now by that time as the, as the 80s and the Reagan years and the Reagan build-up

965
01:14:06.64 --> 01:14:09.64
starts, the money started to come.

966
01:14:09.64 --> 01:14:13.64
But before that, uh, we in the seal team, we're living on a shoe string after Vietnam.

967
01:14:13.64 --> 01:14:17.64
Uh, I mean, you know, you, uh, you would go out to Nyland, California,

968
01:14:17.64 --> 01:14:20.64
uh, which was our, our desert, our desert training area.

969
01:14:20.64 --> 01:14:21.64
It's our only training area.

970
01:14:21.64 --> 01:14:25.64
And, uh, and I think they, they paid you like $8 a day.

971
01:14:25.64 --> 01:14:27.64
Uh, and, and you were like, woo, $8 a day.

972
01:14:27.64 --> 01:14:28.64
That's great.

973
01:14:28.64 --> 01:14:32.64
Uh, because a lot of other places you went, you went on permissive T.D.Y.

974
01:14:32.64 --> 01:14:34.64
Meaning they didn't, didn't pay anything.

975
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:35.64
You just went.

976
01:14:35.64 --> 01:14:38.64
Um, we always had a lot of ammunition and demolition.

977
01:14:38.64 --> 01:14:39.64
But not much else.

978
01:14:39.64 --> 01:14:41.64
What was the billet that you ran out of the Pentagon?

979
01:14:41.64 --> 01:14:46.64
So I was the assistant to the director of, uh, what they called, up 37.

980
01:14:46.64 --> 01:14:50.64
So 337 was the designator for the Naval Special Warfare, actually,

981
01:14:50.64 --> 01:14:52.64
I'm not sure we called it Naval Special Warfare, right then.

982
01:14:52.64 --> 01:14:54.64
That didn't come along until a little bit later.

983
01:14:54.64 --> 01:14:59.64
But, yeah, that was a seal component in the Pentagon that did all the resourcing.

984
01:14:59.64 --> 01:15:05.64
I know when I came in the military, I thought, like, the whole idea that you had to pay for

985
01:15:05.64 --> 01:15:07.64
stuff just didn't even make sense to me.

986
01:15:07.64 --> 01:15:09.64
I thought everything was just free, right?

987
01:15:09.64 --> 01:15:10.64
Hey, you need gas.

988
01:15:10.64 --> 01:15:14.64
You go to the gas thing at the Navy base and they'll give you the gas you need.

989
01:15:14.64 --> 01:15:18.64
Didn't even make sense to me that you had to pay for ammo and that human beings.

990
01:15:18.64 --> 01:15:20.64
Like, oh, you're going to assign people to a seal team.

991
01:15:20.64 --> 01:15:23.64
Well, but I was just, they're just people that show up there.

992
01:15:23.64 --> 01:15:27.64
So that, that the idea that was real foreign to me when people started talking

993
01:15:27.64 --> 01:15:30.64
about how much this trip is going to cost.

994
01:15:30.64 --> 01:15:32.64
I would be like, what were in the military?

995
01:15:32.64 --> 01:15:34.64
What are you talking about?

996
01:15:34.64 --> 01:15:36.64
Um, so that gave you, yeah, for sure.

997
01:15:36.64 --> 01:15:38.64
That's some insight you asked ahead.

998
01:15:38.64 --> 01:15:41.64
You were like a black belt compared to the rest of these guys running around.

999
01:15:41.64 --> 01:15:43.64
Yeah, and nobody wanted to go to the Pentagon, of course.

1000
01:15:43.64 --> 01:15:45.64
And, and Nor had I wanted to go initially.

1001
01:15:45.64 --> 01:15:49.64
Um, but again, it turned out to be a great two and a half years because you learned

1002
01:15:49.64 --> 01:15:50.64
the system well.

1003
01:15:50.64 --> 01:15:53.64
And frankly, that served me throughout, as I became a community officer in the

1004
01:15:53.64 --> 01:15:57.64
Commodore, I understood how to walk the halls of the Pentagon and how to leverage

1005
01:15:57.64 --> 01:16:01.64
those resources we needed to get the job done.

1006
01:16:01.64 --> 01:16:05.64
Yeah, you mentioned so far a bunch of different relationships that you have.

1007
01:16:05.64 --> 01:16:10.64
Had and built and I mean, they, they shine throughout everything that you're right about.

1008
01:16:10.64 --> 01:16:13.64
It's all about who you're working with and oh, I've worked with this guy in the past and

1009
01:16:13.64 --> 01:16:17.64
knew this individual and we spent time together the relationships that you build.

1010
01:16:17.64 --> 01:16:21.64
But not only in the SEAL teams, but then you start talking about relationships that you have

1011
01:16:21.64 --> 01:16:25.64
and in the Pentagon and who you work with there and who you know, it's.

1012
01:16:25.64 --> 01:16:30.64
You can't, there's no possible way to to overestimate the amount of,

1013
01:16:30.64 --> 01:16:34.64
or why you get on having good relationships with people and treat them.

1014
01:16:34.64 --> 01:16:35.64
It's good.

1015
01:16:35.64 --> 01:16:36.64
All of the people.

1016
01:16:36.64 --> 01:16:40.64
It's all about relationships and particularly after 9.11, you realize even more so because

1017
01:16:40.64 --> 01:16:44.64
your relationships with the CIA, with the National Security Agency, with the National

1018
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:49.64
Geospatial Agency, with the Army Navy Air Force Marine Corps, with the service

1019
01:16:49.64 --> 01:16:52.64
chiefs when I became the so-com commander.

1020
01:16:52.64 --> 01:16:56.64
I mean, you have to build these relationships with the combatant commanders, with up and

1021
01:16:56.64 --> 01:16:59.64
down the chain of command because it's the relationships that are going to

1022
01:16:59.64 --> 01:17:01.64
allow you to get the mission done.

1023
01:17:01.64 --> 01:17:04.64
And if you have built good relationships, if you haven't burned the bridges because you

1024
01:17:04.64 --> 01:17:09.64
got hacked off about something, those relationships really pay dividends in combat.

1025
01:17:09.64 --> 01:17:14.64
I had my, when I was a task unit commander, my two-partume commanders come into me and

1026
01:17:14.64 --> 01:17:18.64
we're out at Nylon and we've got a bunch of paperwork due to the commanding officer.

1027
01:17:18.64 --> 01:17:22.64
You know, the serialized inventory and the qualifications, the various guys and all this.

1028
01:17:22.64 --> 01:17:26.64
And they, they look like, we should have to do all this paperwork right now.

1029
01:17:26.64 --> 01:17:27.64
This is bullshit.

1030
01:17:27.64 --> 01:17:29.64
Come on.

1031
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:31.64
We're, we're training for war.

1032
01:17:31.64 --> 01:17:35.64
And, you know, they tried to, they tried to capitalize on my war like me.

1033
01:17:35.64 --> 01:17:37.64
They tried to, you know, we're training for war.

1034
01:17:37.64 --> 01:17:39.64
And I said, hey, guys, we're going to do all this paperwork.

1035
01:17:39.64 --> 01:17:42.64
We're going to turn in perfectly and we're going to do it before anyone else does.

1036
01:17:42.64 --> 01:17:44.64
Because we got to have a good relationship with the boss.

1037
01:17:44.64 --> 01:17:47.64
And if the boss doesn't think I can get paperwork turned in on time, why is he going

1038
01:17:47.64 --> 01:17:49.64
to trust me to go out and run operations?

1039
01:17:49.64 --> 01:17:50.64
Exactly right.

1040
01:17:50.64 --> 01:17:55.64
From there, you know, you go to, to exo-seal team one.

1041
01:17:55.64 --> 01:17:59.64
Who's that? Who is the seal when you were there?

1042
01:17:59.64 --> 01:18:01.64
Commander Tim Holden. Okay.

1043
01:18:01.64 --> 01:18:01.64
Yeah.

1044
01:18:01.64 --> 01:18:05.64
Phenom Laws, or Naval Academy graduate MIT, a lot like Danle Stewart.

1045
01:18:05.64 --> 01:18:07.64
I mean, hard as nails.

1046
01:18:07.64 --> 01:18:13.64
Tim would the PT everybody into the ground, just a remarkable officer.

1047
01:18:13.64 --> 01:18:16.64
Unfortunately, he was killed in the bicycle accident several years ago.

1048
01:18:16.64 --> 01:18:18.64
But just a terrific terrific guy.

1049
01:18:18.64 --> 01:18:24.64
And you did one, you did one operation there, which was the recovery of a Navy aircraft.

1050
01:18:24.64 --> 01:18:26.64
That had crashed in 1948.

1051
01:18:26.64 --> 01:18:28.64
Yeah, it was a P2V.

1052
01:18:28.64 --> 01:18:30.64
So think of the P3 variant back then.

1053
01:18:30.64 --> 01:18:34.64
And yeah, Commander Holden, Tim Holden had been sent out as you recall.

1054
01:18:34.64 --> 01:18:37.64
This was during the kind of the tanker wars and been sent out to the windbrown.

1055
01:18:37.64 --> 01:18:41.64
So I was the acting CEO as the executive officer.

1056
01:18:41.64 --> 01:18:45.64
And George Bush, who had been, I think initially the vice president,

1057
01:18:45.64 --> 01:18:50.64
then of course became president, had had been petitioned by the families of the,

1058
01:18:50.64 --> 01:18:54.64
the naval aviators that have been killed in this crash.

1059
01:18:54.64 --> 01:18:56.64
The plane had never been found.

1060
01:18:56.64 --> 01:19:01.64
And they had been asking for the Navy to put on kind of a full court press,

1061
01:19:01.64 --> 01:19:05.64
try to find the aircraft there had been some speculation where it went down.

1062
01:19:05.64 --> 01:19:07.64
And this had gone on for years.

1063
01:19:07.64 --> 01:19:12.64
Eventually, somebody found the remains, but because it was in such kind of treacherous condition,

1064
01:19:12.64 --> 01:19:16.64
they couldn't, or found the, what they thought was the remains of the airplane,

1065
01:19:16.64 --> 01:19:18.64
but couldn't get to it.

1066
01:19:18.64 --> 01:19:23.64
So obviously, we get the letter, you know, the president wants us to go recover

1067
01:19:23.64 --> 01:19:25.64
to the aircraft because it's at about 10,000 feet.

1068
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:26.64
That's why they thought it was.

1069
01:19:26.64 --> 01:19:29.64
And they figured we could do some high-altitude diving.

1070
01:19:29.64 --> 01:19:32.64
So as the executive officer, I get tagged to be the kind of mission commander.

1071
01:19:32.64 --> 01:19:34.64
And it was a unique experience.

1072
01:19:34.64 --> 01:19:39.64
I took kind of George Park Hill, who was, I think George was probably a chief or

1073
01:19:39.64 --> 01:19:40.64
senior chief at the time.

1074
01:19:40.64 --> 01:19:42.64
And then the dive locked him on.

1075
01:19:42.64 --> 01:19:44.64
And he was the dive master.

1076
01:19:44.64 --> 01:19:45.64
And that's why I picked George.

1077
01:19:45.64 --> 01:19:48.64
And a couple of other great guys to go up there.

1078
01:19:48.64 --> 01:19:51.64
And so we get up to this place called Firstofino.

1079
01:19:51.64 --> 01:19:55.64
And then we have to take a yellow out to the middle of nowhere on the outback.

1080
01:19:55.64 --> 01:20:00.64
And the place where we think the plane is crashed is in what I believe

1081
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:05.64
to have been coming all of volcanic, you know, area.

1082
01:20:05.64 --> 01:20:09.64
I mean, it looks like the inside of what you think of as a volcano, almost like

1083
01:20:09.64 --> 01:20:10.64
Diamondhead.

1084
01:20:10.64 --> 01:20:12.64
And there's a lake in the middle of it.

1085
01:20:12.64 --> 01:20:16.64
Where the snow has melted off and you could only get into this place like for a month

1086
01:20:16.64 --> 01:20:19.64
out of the year because it would freeze over.

1087
01:20:19.64 --> 01:20:21.64
And so this was, I think, September timeframe.

1088
01:20:21.64 --> 01:20:24.64
So we get on the ground and there's, I mean, the helo can't even land.

1089
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:27.64
So we had to kind of jump off the helo and kind of get set up.

1090
01:20:27.64 --> 01:20:33.64
But we're looking around and there's clearly no airplane in this, in this bowl

1091
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:34.64
we're in.

1092
01:20:34.64 --> 01:20:37.64
But there is, off to the area where the sun doesn't hit.

1093
01:20:37.64 --> 01:20:40.64
So the sun would kind of make its way around, but never kind of got to this area.

1094
01:20:40.64 --> 01:20:45.64
And as you look, there's this kind of, the only thing I think of to describe is like a snow tunnel.

1095
01:20:45.64 --> 01:20:50.64
And it goes up about a thousand plus feet and it is, you know, I mean, it's just a,

1096
01:20:50.64 --> 01:20:53.64
an area that's just completely covered with ice.

1097
01:20:53.64 --> 01:20:57.64
And we're looking around thinking that the plane is probably in the water.

1098
01:20:57.64 --> 01:20:59.64
That's where why we were sent up to get it.

1099
01:20:59.64 --> 01:21:04.64
Well, the next day after we get in there, Park Hill goes over and starts

1100
01:21:04.64 --> 01:21:09.64
chipping into this, this kind of ice cave and goes in and I'll be down there.

1101
01:21:09.64 --> 01:21:14.64
The plane is, it is hidden under the size cave and has been there for, you know,

1102
01:21:14.64 --> 01:21:15.64
40, 50 years that point in time.

1103
01:21:15.64 --> 01:21:19.64
Of course it is because the ice would melt and it would just crush the plane.

1104
01:21:19.64 --> 01:21:24.64
So there's nothing left, but you know, tiny pieces, although actually the 50 cows survived.

1105
01:21:24.64 --> 01:21:27.64
But so now we have found the remains of the plane.

1106
01:21:27.64 --> 01:21:32.64
And again, there was some, we eventually bring some of the family out.

1107
01:21:32.64 --> 01:21:34.64
It was fitting enough to be there.

1108
01:21:34.64 --> 01:21:38.64
We did manage find some bone fragments and we buried those at the site.

1109
01:21:38.64 --> 01:21:44.64
But in the, in the book, I, I tell the story and I said, you can believe it or not,

1110
01:21:44.64 --> 01:21:47.64
but it is true and I'm not the only one to have seen it.

1111
01:21:47.64 --> 01:21:51.64
As we are kind of burying the, the remains of this thing.

1112
01:21:51.64 --> 01:21:55.64
And we, I say a little prayer over this, this cross we put up there.

1113
01:21:55.64 --> 01:22:00.64
And as I get through saying it, I'll send one of the guys turns me goes,

1114
01:22:00.64 --> 01:22:04.64
hey sir, take a look up there.

1115
01:22:04.64 --> 01:22:11.64
And again, if you can imagine we're in this bowl and I think it goes up to about 8,000 feet or something like that.

1116
01:22:11.64 --> 01:22:17.64
And right above the ridge line, I see what looks like a parachute flare.

1117
01:22:17.64 --> 01:22:24.64
I'm thinking, if somebody shoot in parachute flares, you know, I'm looking around thinking,

1118
01:22:24.64 --> 01:22:27.64
well, maybe one of our guys is, you know, shooting parachute flares,

1119
01:22:27.64 --> 01:22:35.64
I know what a shooting parachute flares, there's one, and there's two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,

1120
01:22:35.64 --> 01:22:37.64
and the kind of hovering up there.

1121
01:22:37.64 --> 01:22:40.64
And look around taking a foot in the world.

1122
01:22:40.64 --> 01:22:44.64
And the guy says, hey sir, how many of those do you see?

1123
01:22:44.64 --> 01:22:48.64
And again, it's just this kind of glowing orb and it's just kind of floating up there and,

1124
01:22:48.64 --> 01:22:50.64
we're nine of them.

1125
01:22:50.64 --> 01:22:52.64
And there were nine victims on the plane.

1126
01:22:52.64 --> 01:22:55.64
And it was up there for 10 or 15 minutes.

1127
01:22:55.64 --> 01:22:59.64
I'll kind of hover it up and then one by one, they just kind of went up.

1128
01:22:59.64 --> 01:23:04.64
So I said, look, you can believe the story or not, but not the only one that's on it.

1129
01:23:04.64 --> 01:23:08.64
And I've often thought, well, if somebody was firing parachute flares, please let me know

1130
01:23:08.64 --> 01:23:13.64
because it was kind of one of those surreal moments because you are out in the outback

1131
01:23:13.64 --> 01:23:16.64
where there is nothing out there.

1132
01:23:16.64 --> 01:23:22.64
But interestingly enough, another kind of story like the Barney Browse story

1133
01:23:22.64 --> 01:23:29.64
and that I did a call from a good friend who you had no Jeremy Williams.

1134
01:23:29.64 --> 01:23:35.64
And Jay W says, hey, sir, got an army buddy.

1135
01:23:35.64 --> 01:23:38.64
We were just having dinner and I was telling him about your book.

1136
01:23:38.64 --> 01:23:42.64
And he's going to call you when he gets to San Francisco.

1137
01:23:42.64 --> 01:23:47.64
I said, okay, so he's flying back to Hawaii and I got a call from this guy.

1138
01:23:47.64 --> 01:23:51.64
He says, hey, sir, Jay W was telling me about your story and your book.

1139
01:23:51.64 --> 01:23:53.64
And so I got a copy of it.

1140
01:23:53.64 --> 01:23:57.64
That was my grandfather that died on that crash.

1141
01:23:57.64 --> 01:24:00.64
And by the way, my grandmother is still alive.

1142
01:24:00.64 --> 01:24:04.64
So I got a hold of the grandmother and it was just a great conversation.

1143
01:24:04.64 --> 01:24:06.64
Wonderful lady.

1144
01:24:06.64 --> 01:24:10.64
And I told her, I said, man, I don't know what to say.

1145
01:24:10.64 --> 01:24:13.64
The story I'm telling you in the book is exactly true.

1146
01:24:13.64 --> 01:24:19.64
You know, my hope is, you know, that your husband is in the right place.

1147
01:24:19.64 --> 01:24:24.64
And this and her husband had been a young pediolce in the Navy during World War Two.

1148
01:24:24.64 --> 01:24:27.64
It gets out of the Navy after World War Two.

1149
01:24:27.64 --> 01:24:29.64
And then, Mr. Navy so much comes back in.

1150
01:24:29.64 --> 01:24:34.64
Get to sign up to with the island as a back ender on this P2V and, unfortunately,

1151
01:24:34.64 --> 01:24:36.64
crashes in the P2V.

1152
01:24:36.64 --> 01:24:39.64
And there's 23 years old or something like that.

1153
01:24:39.64 --> 01:24:42.64
But it was just the connections.

1154
01:24:42.64 --> 01:24:44.64
I've been interested in him.

1155
01:24:44.64 --> 01:24:47.64
The book gets out there and then somebody reads it and then makes a connection.

1156
01:24:47.64 --> 01:24:50.64
You know, six degrees for a move sort of thing.

1157
01:24:50.64 --> 01:24:54.64
Yeah, that whole story is sounds.

1158
01:24:54.64 --> 01:24:55.64
It's almost supernatural.

1159
01:24:55.64 --> 01:24:56.64
It's the story.

1160
01:24:56.64 --> 01:25:00.64
There are other things that you talk about in the book worth reading.

1161
01:25:00.64 --> 01:25:05.64
So you get done with that and you do, is that when you rolled into being a task unit commander?

1162
01:25:05.64 --> 01:25:06.64
Right.

1163
01:25:06.64 --> 01:25:08.64
So then this was right before it does its storm.

1164
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:12.64
So when I left the XO back then, the executive officers,

1165
01:25:12.64 --> 01:25:15.64
a lot of times would go do and be the task unit commander for a deployed,

1166
01:25:15.64 --> 01:25:18.64
you know, a shield button on an amphibious ready group.

1167
01:25:18.64 --> 01:25:24.64
So it was, again, this was 1990, summer of 1990,

1168
01:25:24.64 --> 01:25:26.64
and I'm with Comphibron 5.

1169
01:25:26.64 --> 01:25:30.64
And so I go off as an O4 as the task unit commander.

1170
01:25:30.64 --> 01:25:35.64
And no sooner, you know, we left in June, I guess.

1171
01:25:35.64 --> 01:25:39.64
And then, sedan invades Iraq in August, I think.

1172
01:25:39.64 --> 01:25:43.64
So we were already on deployment and we were a full up amphibious ready group.

1173
01:25:43.64 --> 01:25:49.64
So we became kind of the go-to guys as the rest of the Navy was kind of building the rest of the amphibious

1174
01:25:49.64 --> 01:25:50.64
ready groups.

1175
01:25:50.64 --> 01:25:52.64
But we'd already been through the whole work up.

1176
01:25:52.64 --> 01:25:56.64
So we kind of immediately got tasked to head out to the Gulf.

1177
01:25:56.64 --> 01:26:01.64
I had a chance to introduce some maritime introduction operations, which were a lot of fun,

1178
01:26:01.64 --> 01:26:04.64
considering those were kind of the first of their kind.

1179
01:26:04.64 --> 01:26:06.64
That was the big mesh back there.

1180
01:26:06.64 --> 01:26:07.64
That's right.

1181
01:26:07.64 --> 01:26:11.64
The meal, the maritime introduction operations.

1182
01:26:11.64 --> 01:26:16.64
Those were, I did those in, what was it,

1183
01:26:16.64 --> 01:26:20.64
1990, nine, well I guess I did some in the mid-90s.

1184
01:26:20.64 --> 01:26:22.64
But yeah, those were real world.

1185
01:26:22.64 --> 01:26:25.64
They got to lock and load my weapon.

1186
01:26:25.64 --> 01:26:29.64
Well, what else did you guys do for on that?

1187
01:26:29.64 --> 01:26:32.64
Did you guys do some hit some islands or something?

1188
01:26:32.64 --> 01:26:40.64
Yes, so we went out there first time in, I want to say November, December, and then,

1189
01:26:40.64 --> 01:26:45.64
we didn't know whether or not we were actually going to come into Kuwait.

1190
01:26:45.64 --> 01:26:49.64
So they sent us back to the Subic Bay for about three weeks.

1191
01:26:49.64 --> 01:26:53.64
Not knowing, well, are we going to, you know,

1192
01:26:53.64 --> 01:26:56.64
we're going to send a large force into Kuwait to kick Saddam out.

1193
01:26:56.64 --> 01:26:59.64
And so that was all still up in the air.

1194
01:26:59.64 --> 01:27:02.64
So they said, look, you guys are the most experienced, go back and wait.

1195
01:27:02.64 --> 01:27:05.64
So I think we spent Christmas in Subic.

1196
01:27:05.64 --> 01:27:08.64
And then we got the word, no, we think the things are going to go.

1197
01:27:08.64 --> 01:27:10.64
So they sailed us back out.

1198
01:27:10.64 --> 01:27:15.64
We went through the straights in the lock and the straights of Hormuz about half dozen times.

1199
01:27:15.64 --> 01:27:19.64
So we get out there into the Gulf and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

1200
01:27:19.64 --> 01:27:24.64
yeah, so first back in the November timeframe, we did the maritime introduction operations on some variety tankers.

1201
01:27:24.64 --> 01:27:28.64
And then our job was going to be to prep for the amphibious landing.

1202
01:27:28.64 --> 01:27:35.64
And so in addition to the fibron five, they brought what then later became the largest amphibious force.

1203
01:27:35.64 --> 01:27:39.64
I think since Korea, 33 ships, looking to do it in amphibious landing.

1204
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:43.64
And I think the place called Ashawaba in Kuwait with the idea that we were landing the force.

1205
01:27:43.64 --> 01:27:49.64
And then, you know, begin to engage with the ground force and then push Saddam out of Kuwait.

1206
01:27:49.64 --> 01:27:53.64
Well, it, it, of course, became one of the faints.

1207
01:27:53.64 --> 01:27:57.64
The idea was, we, we want to hold down Saddam's forces.

1208
01:27:57.64 --> 01:28:03.64
So it kind of became known, I think, to the Iraqi army that we were going to land a large force of Ashawaba.

1209
01:28:03.64 --> 01:28:08.64
So, of course, two divisions came, set down in Kuwait to stop us from from landing.

1210
01:28:08.64 --> 01:28:11.64
Well, that allowed the ground forces to kind of sweep around.

1211
01:28:11.64 --> 01:28:13.64
And so we didn't do the amphibious landing.

1212
01:28:13.64 --> 01:28:14.64
We did take a couple of islands.

1213
01:28:14.64 --> 01:28:19.64
We took, uh, phalaka island, uh, which was, it was, it was actually very interesting.

1214
01:28:19.64 --> 01:28:21.64
Again, a good lesson for me.

1215
01:28:21.64 --> 01:28:25.64
So phalaka, uh, had been bombed for like a hundred straight days.

1216
01:28:25.64 --> 01:28:29.64
We're twelve hundred Iraqi officers are officers and listed on the phalaka island.

1217
01:28:29.64 --> 01:28:34.64
Because it was a kind of a key position before you got up into the, into the waterway.

1218
01:28:34.64 --> 01:28:38.64
And, uh, and Navy fighters when they would come back, they'd have to dump their bombs.

1219
01:28:38.64 --> 01:28:44.64
So, for, again, like, 90 days or something, they were dropping bombs, ordinance on phalaka.

1220
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:47.64
And phalaka island was only about two inches above sea level.

1221
01:28:47.64 --> 01:28:49.64
And it's just flat as it could be.

1222
01:28:49.64 --> 01:28:54.64
So the Iraqis at night would, you know, they, the trenches and they'd hide in the trenches as we're dropping bombs on.

1223
01:28:54.64 --> 01:28:59.64
So finally, uh, when the time came, the Iraqis surrendered in phalaka.

1224
01:28:59.64 --> 01:29:04.64
And we go, we go pick up these guys, twelve hundred of them, and moved them from phalaka to the amphibes.

1225
01:29:04.64 --> 01:29:08.64
Uh, before we sent them back to, like Saudi Arabia and then back to quite.

1226
01:29:08.64 --> 01:29:14.64
But interestingly enough, with all that bombing, I think the bombs only killed about five Iraqis.

1227
01:29:14.64 --> 01:29:20.64
So it showed, you know, we wonder, you know, how, how did the Germans withstand the naval bombardment on Normandy,

1228
01:29:20.64 --> 01:29:27.64
and how did the Japanese survive it? Well, the answer is if you dig deep enough, even, you know, a thousand pound bombs,

1229
01:29:27.64 --> 01:29:34.64
you know, unless they land right in your head, which apparently would happen to a couple of these guys, you can survive this stuff.

1230
01:29:34.64 --> 01:29:45.64
But also the Iraqis, it was interesting to see as I was the Colonel who accepted their surrender, you know, separated the officers from the enlisted.

1231
01:29:45.64 --> 01:29:50.64
But now I'm, you know, I'm on the island for several hours, and I started flying back with some of the Iraqis.

1232
01:29:50.64 --> 01:29:56.64
And they were, hey man, I'm from Detroit. I came back to Iraq to see my parents actually, you know, I'm, I've been a lot of these guys,

1233
01:29:56.64 --> 01:30:01.64
or American Iraqis that had come back and kind of gotten secunded into the, into the Iraqi army, and we're like,

1234
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:04.64
yeah, I really didn't want to be here, and you have a cigarette by the way.

1235
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:06.64
I don't smoke.

1236
01:30:06.64 --> 01:30:10.64
That's, that was pretty awesome experience though for you.

1237
01:30:10.64 --> 01:30:18.64
And I know that I was a rare guy that volunteered to do argue platoons, because there was actually missions that happened, you know,

1238
01:30:18.64 --> 01:30:25.64
the guys that were, the guys that were in the seal teams that weren't Somalia, a bunch of them came off argue platoons.

1239
01:30:25.64 --> 01:30:31.64
Right. And I was like, okay, if that's where I got to go. And so I volunteered for argue platoons, but we're really helped me out,

1240
01:30:31.64 --> 01:30:36.64
was then I was working with, I was working with the Marine Corps, and we were, you know, building relationships with the Marine Corps,

1241
01:30:36.64 --> 01:30:41.64
but just understanding, look, when you're in a seal pitune, in the 90s, you didn't understand anything about the rest of them,

1242
01:30:41.64 --> 01:30:45.64
Bellatari. It was like, hey, I got a 60-man-platoon, we'll take on the world.

1243
01:30:45.64 --> 01:30:49.64
Then I learned, oh, this is a battalion. This is how this is going to work.

1244
01:30:49.64 --> 01:30:52.64
This is the way we can work together with them. This is the support that we can give them.

1245
01:30:52.64 --> 01:30:59.64
So it was very useful and very helpful for me. I was very glad. I was a calm guy, so I made all the comms plan and learned how to,

1246
01:30:59.64 --> 01:31:04.64
how to communicate with all the different forces. It was very, very helpful for me to do those.

1247
01:31:04.64 --> 01:31:11.64
I did two art deployments and learned a lot about the conventional forces, which was real lucky.

1248
01:31:11.64 --> 01:31:17.64
You get done with that, and now you finally get your time in Monterey.

1249
01:31:17.64 --> 01:31:23.64
Yeah, finally, I think the fifth set of orders. I finally got to Monterey, so I went up there for two years and set up the special operations,

1250
01:31:23.64 --> 01:31:28.64
low intensity conflict, the solar curriculum, and then ended up graduating from that curriculum.

1251
01:31:28.64 --> 01:31:34.64
But also took the time that's when I had an opportunity to write my thesis on the principles of special operations,

1252
01:31:34.64 --> 01:31:40.64
with the theory of special operations. And Monterey was great time, because I've been deployed for ten months on the amphibious

1253
01:31:40.64 --> 01:31:48.64
ready group, and frankly, been running hard for several years. And my wife, while I was deployed, my wife had a third child.

1254
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:56.64
So I came back. My oldest boy had been born when I was going on my first employment.

1255
01:31:56.64 --> 01:32:02.64
He was born in a week later, I grew on an employment. Number two, some was born in the Philippines and jungle general.

1256
01:32:02.64 --> 01:32:08.64
Literally, that's what we call it, jungle general. And in fact, a couple of years ago, when I was the so-com commander,

1257
01:32:08.64 --> 01:32:14.64
we went back out of the Philippines, and I went down to Zamboine, and my wife got a driver from Anila to go back to the Subic Bay.

1258
01:32:14.64 --> 01:32:21.64
She hadn't been there in thirty-some odd years. So I'm down in Zamboine for a couple of days.

1259
01:32:21.64 --> 01:32:27.64
I finally come back up to Manila to pick her up, and I get into the hotel room. And she goes,

1260
01:32:27.64 --> 01:32:35.64
do you know that John was born in a quansit hut? She goes, I mean, he was a quansit hut.

1261
01:32:35.64 --> 01:32:41.64
Yeah, that's all we had was a quansit hut. And so, I mean, jungle general was a series of quansit huts.

1262
01:32:41.64 --> 01:32:49.64
And so, like I said, number two, some was born there. And then we waited quite a while, and finally, for our third child,

1263
01:32:49.64 --> 01:32:55.64
we thought, hey, we got this all figured out. My wife got pregnant. I'm going to go on a six month deployment.

1264
01:32:55.64 --> 01:32:59.64
I'll come back, you know, I'll have time to get ready for the baby to be born.

1265
01:32:59.64 --> 01:33:05.64
Of course, my six month deployment turns into ten months, and I come back and my daughter's a month old.

1266
01:33:05.64 --> 01:33:09.64
Like, hey, I think that worked out okay.

1267
01:33:09.64 --> 01:33:12.64
But we worked out okay for one of you.

1268
01:33:12.64 --> 01:33:16.64
Yeah, that's right. But then we did get up to Manarey, and that was good time.

1269
01:33:16.64 --> 01:33:20.64
So, out there is where your thesis became a book.

1270
01:33:20.64 --> 01:33:24.64
And the book is called Spacops, Case Studies and Special Operations Warfare Theory and Practice.

1271
01:33:24.64 --> 01:33:28.64
I'm going to jump into this a little bit. Call Von Closquits. In his book on war noted,

1272
01:33:28.64 --> 01:33:32.64
the defensive form of warfare is intrinsically stronger than the offense.

1273
01:33:32.64 --> 01:33:37.64
It contributes resisting power, the ability to preserve and protect oneself.

1274
01:33:37.64 --> 01:33:42.64
Thus, the defense generally has a negative aim that of resisting the enemies will.

1275
01:33:42.64 --> 01:33:48.64
If we are to mount an offensive to impose our will, we must develop enough force to overcome the inherent

1276
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:51.64
superiority of the enemy's defense.

1277
01:33:51.64 --> 01:33:57.64
Cosquits theory of war states that to, quote, defeat stronger, the stronger form of warfare,

1278
01:33:57.64 --> 01:34:02.64
an army's best weapon is superior numbers.

1279
01:34:02.64 --> 01:34:09.64
In this sense, superiority of numbers admittedly is the most important factor in the outcome of

1280
01:34:09.64 --> 01:34:15.64
an engagement. So long as it is not, so long as it's great enough to counterbalance all other contributing circumstances.

1281
01:34:15.64 --> 01:34:22.64
It thus follows that as many troops as possible should be brought into the engagement at the decisive point.

1282
01:34:22.64 --> 01:34:28.64
So you start off with that, which people always ask me. I've covered just about every,

1283
01:34:28.64 --> 01:34:33.64
well, I've covered a lot of war theory, and I never covered Closquits. And one of the reasons I never covered Closquits

1284
01:34:33.64 --> 01:34:38.64
are having yet, I've covered a little bit, but is because I like LaDelle Hark better of course.

1285
01:34:38.64 --> 01:34:43.64
And so apparently you feel the same way.

1286
01:34:43.64 --> 01:34:50.64
Continue on with your book. No soldier would argue the benefit of superior numbers, but if they were the most important factor,

1287
01:34:50.64 --> 01:34:57.64
how could 69 German commandos have defeated a Belgian force of 650 soldiers protected by the largest,

1288
01:34:57.64 --> 01:35:04.64
most extensive fortress of its time, the fort at even a mal, which is a special operations,

1289
01:35:04.64 --> 01:35:11.64
paratroopers, landed with gliders on this. And as you just said, 69 German paratroopers

1290
01:35:11.64 --> 01:35:20.64
took on this massive Belgian force and one. How can special operations force that has inferior numbers?

1291
01:35:20.64 --> 01:35:25.64
And the disadvantage of attacking the stronger form of warfare gained superiority over the enemy

1292
01:35:25.64 --> 01:35:32.64
to understand this paradoxes to understand special operations. Relative superiority, relative superiority

1293
01:35:32.64 --> 01:35:38.64
is a concept crucial to the theory of special operations. Simply stated relative superiority is a condition

1294
01:35:38.64 --> 01:35:45.64
that exists when an attacking force generally smaller gains a decisive advantage over a larger or well-defended enemy.

1295
01:35:45.64 --> 01:35:54.64
The value of which the concept of relative superiority lies in its ability to illustrate which positive forces influence the success of a mission

1296
01:35:54.64 --> 01:35:59.64
and to show how the frictions of war affect the achievement of the goal.

1297
01:35:59.64 --> 01:36:08.64
This section will define the three basic properties of relative superiority and describe how those properties are revealed in combat.

1298
01:36:08.64 --> 01:36:14.64
And then you talk about relative superiority as achieved at a pivotal moment in the engagement.

1299
01:36:14.64 --> 01:36:19.64
Once relative superiority is achieved, it must be sustained in order to guarantee victory.

1300
01:36:19.64 --> 01:36:24.64
And if relative superiority is lost, it is difficult to regain again.

1301
01:36:24.64 --> 01:36:31.64
And then you go on to explain what you already mentioned, the six principles of special operations,

1302
01:36:31.64 --> 01:36:36.64
simplicity, security, repetitions, surprise, speed and purpose.

1303
01:36:36.64 --> 01:36:44.64
And the book, what this book consists of is case studies that describe and show how all these things come into play.

1304
01:36:44.64 --> 01:36:51.64
So that's, you made pretty good time of your session up there in Monterey.

1305
01:36:51.64 --> 01:36:56.64
Yeah, you know, it was, to your point, you take advantage of the opportunity you get.

1306
01:36:56.64 --> 01:37:02.64
I found studying at postgraduate school was, yeah, I'd been an operator for 15 years.

1307
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:10.64
It was great to actually now to kind of get an opportunity to get intellectually engaged and there was some phenomenal faculty and professors up there.

1308
01:37:10.64 --> 01:37:17.64
But when I'm on the side of the right of thesis, I'd read a lot of clouds, what's in, you know, clouds, what's kind of talks about the principles of war, you know,

1309
01:37:17.64 --> 01:37:20.64
everybody has these ideas of various principles of war.

1310
01:37:20.64 --> 01:37:25.64
And clouds, what's this point there is like the defense is always going to be stronger than the offense,

1311
01:37:25.64 --> 01:37:28.64
because the defense just has to preserve and protect.

1312
01:37:28.64 --> 01:37:32.64
While the offense has to impose its will upon the enemy.

1313
01:37:32.64 --> 01:37:36.64
So that was the, but then if that's true, then why does soft work?

1314
01:37:36.64 --> 01:37:40.64
So I went in there initially looking for the principles of special operations.

1315
01:37:40.64 --> 01:37:50.64
So I, I went and visited all these places and talked to all these commandos and, and the, but I was visiting,

1316
01:37:50.64 --> 01:37:59.64
I was in, in Germany meeting with Lieutenant Vitsich who was the, at the time, with the Lieutenant that read, read the raid on a BNML.

1317
01:37:59.64 --> 01:38:05.64
And Colin Kilrain, who was a young lieutenant at the time who is now a vice-abmal,

1318
01:38:05.64 --> 01:38:10.64
Colin Kilrain was stationed up in Ekinferty with the Compsfembers.

1319
01:38:10.64 --> 01:38:13.64
So Colin was going to be my, my translator.

1320
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:17.64
And so we linked up and went all over Europe, interviewing these guys.

1321
01:38:17.64 --> 01:38:20.64
It was great, but we get down to talk to Lieutenant Vitsich.

1322
01:38:20.64 --> 01:38:24.64
And it was hard to find these guys, because again, this said that there was some sense,

1323
01:38:24.64 --> 01:38:28.64
because they had been in the German military, was there some Nazi overtones, etc, etc.

1324
01:38:28.64 --> 01:38:34.64
Didn't, not the case with Lieutenant Vitsich because he had gone on to work in the West German army and retired as a colonel.

1325
01:38:34.64 --> 01:38:40.64
But nonetheless, I think there was always some concern about, you know, some of the wartime efforts.

1326
01:38:40.64 --> 01:38:46.64
But finally, Colin tracks him down. So we go to Vizim and, and I'm sitting there for three hours,

1327
01:38:46.64 --> 01:38:49.64
and I have created this list of questions for him.

1328
01:38:49.64 --> 01:38:54.64
And, and he's a very stern fellow and, and, and it was very cautious early on.

1329
01:38:54.64 --> 01:38:57.64
And so as we're talking, and I'm, I'm asking you these questions.

1330
01:38:57.64 --> 01:39:00.64
Colin is translating them and he's answering them.

1331
01:39:00.64 --> 01:39:05.64
Short, almost bluntly,

1332
01:39:05.64 --> 01:39:09.64
doesn't seem particularly happy that I'm there, but he's trying to be gracious.

1333
01:39:09.64 --> 01:39:13.64
And finally, about three hours into it, I turned to Colin, I said,

1334
01:39:13.64 --> 01:39:22.64
ask the colonel if he's the one that actually developed the plan for how the demolition was going to be used on the surface of a better male.

1335
01:39:22.64 --> 01:39:25.64
And in perfect English, he says, yes, I was.

1336
01:39:25.64 --> 01:39:29.64
And we continue on in English for the next hour or so.

1337
01:39:29.64 --> 01:39:34.64
He'd been vetting me. He wanted to find out whether or not this was a serious, but it was the colonel.

1338
01:39:34.64 --> 01:39:38.64
So he says, at one point in time, I'm kind of talking about this. He says,

1339
01:39:38.64 --> 01:39:41.64
so you are trying to develop a theory here.

1340
01:39:41.64 --> 01:39:45.64
And at the time, I was not. I was just trying to identify principles.

1341
01:39:45.64 --> 01:39:50.64
And I thought, huh, he says, I think you are working on a theory.

1342
01:39:50.64 --> 01:39:52.64
You need to flesh out the theory.

1343
01:39:52.64 --> 01:39:55.64
And so I went back and spent the next year thinking,

1344
01:39:55.64 --> 01:40:05.64
okay, how do you take, not just the principles, but what is the theory of special, why do special operations work when they shouldn't work based on kind of clouds with some lot of others?

1345
01:40:05.64 --> 01:40:11.64
And then again, the case studies kind of bore out why they work in certain areas and why they don't.

1346
01:40:11.64 --> 01:40:19.64
But the study of that paid dividends for me after 9.11 because every single time, I reviewed a mission.

1347
01:40:19.64 --> 01:40:28.64
And I figured at one point in time that I had touched about 10,000 missions over the course of my time as the deputy commander J. Sock and the J. Sock commander.

1348
01:40:28.64 --> 01:40:38.64
Where, you know, you're either commanding them, you're overseeing them or you're reviewing them because, you know, every concept of operation early on had to come to a general officer.

1349
01:40:38.64 --> 01:40:42.64
So I would review every concept of operation as well.

1350
01:40:42.64 --> 01:40:54.64
And I always ask myself, okay, we're making this too hard. Is it a simple plan carefully concealed, repeatedly rehearsed, and executed with surprise, speed, and purpose.

1351
01:40:54.64 --> 01:40:59.64
And that was that was the essence of this recognizing that the frictions of war,

1352
01:40:59.64 --> 01:41:15.64
and the chance of uncertainty should happen is going to try to knock your plan off this kind of apex that it's on. And the only thing that's going to keep it upright is the courage and the boldness and the perseverance of the men that are that are fighting to keep this plan upright.

1353
01:41:15.64 --> 01:41:22.64
And as I would think through all of these concepts, so I'd see the con up, I'd say, we're making this too complicated, guys.

1354
01:41:22.64 --> 01:41:35.64
Make it make it easier, make it simpler. I mean, I was always trying to get to the simplest approach that you couldn't always get there, but you wanted to do that because you realized the simpler was the less chance.

1355
01:41:35.64 --> 01:41:40.64
The less risk you were going to have, the less chance of things could go wrong.

1356
01:41:40.64 --> 01:41:45.64
And that was just always, you know, in the back of my mind, then of course, the bin Laden raid comes along.

1357
01:41:45.64 --> 01:41:53.64
And we adhered to the the thesis, the theory is closely as we could. I said, like, I won't, we're going to flesh out of this out. We are going to keep this plan.

1358
01:41:53.64 --> 01:41:55.64
And so we're going to go from point A to point B in a helicopter.

1359
01:41:55.64 --> 01:42:06.64
Get on the ground just like we do. You know, we've done thousands of times before. We're not going to make it complicated. We'll get the bad guy. We'll put him on a helicopter and take him on. That's it.

1360
01:42:06.64 --> 01:42:16.64
Oh, by the way, now we're going to repeat this thing. We're going to rehearse rehearse rehearse rehearse. We're going to keep it confidential. So nobody else knows about it. And then when the day comes, do the mission.

1361
01:42:16.64 --> 01:42:21.64
We will have surprise, speed, and got nose we had purpose.

1362
01:42:21.64 --> 01:42:29.64
So, you know, that was just the way I tended after my time of Monterey tended to look at every single mission we did.

1363
01:42:29.64 --> 01:42:33.64
You get done with Monterey. And then what's next?

1364
01:42:33.64 --> 01:42:40.64
So after Monterey, I went back down to Naval Special Warfare Command for about a year waiting to take command.

1365
01:42:40.64 --> 01:42:48.64
And I was training officer down there for a year just to have been in position holding a holding position if you will until I took command of Sealteen 3.

1366
01:42:48.64 --> 01:42:54.64
Is that when you did the project where you're kind of looking at the next generation of warfare?

1367
01:42:54.64 --> 01:43:06.64
So in between that was really when I was the Chief of Staff. So I left Sealteen 3 and then became the Chief of Staff at Group 1, which for your listeners overseas all the Sealteen on the West Coast.

1368
01:43:06.64 --> 01:43:11.64
And that's when we really began to develop this idea of thinking back to La Delhart.

1369
01:43:11.64 --> 01:43:22.64
I mean, it really was, why do we have to do things the way we have always done them? Because even up till, you know, 1998, we were still doing the way things the way we had done in Vietnam.

1370
01:43:22.64 --> 01:43:32.64
Even even the guys on the elite East Coast Sealteen had not developed too much beyond kind of the standard Sealteen size.

1371
01:43:32.64 --> 01:43:36.64
And by the way, nobody else gets into the platoon, but a platoon guy. You gotta have gone through Buds.

1372
01:43:36.64 --> 01:43:42.64
And it was like, what if you're going to tap into some wire or something? Where is the pencil net geek guy that you're going to bring along?

1373
01:43:42.64 --> 01:43:44.64
So we can't bring him along because he doesn't know how to ride in the Zodiac.

1374
01:43:44.64 --> 01:43:53.64
But two life jackets on him, stick him in the Zodiac because you're bringing this guy along. And then of course, everyone else had taken over a war com when I became the Commodore.

1375
01:43:53.64 --> 01:43:59.64
And he'd seen things work on the East Coast. And so he really wanted to take a look at Naval Special War for even more broadly.

1376
01:43:59.64 --> 01:44:04.64
So how do we have sniper elements? Well back in the day when I came in, the sniper was in your platoon.

1377
01:44:04.64 --> 01:44:11.64
You know, the radioman was in your platoon. Everything was inside the platoon organization.

1378
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:20.64
Well then we began to say, hey, yeah, but your breachers. Well, that's one of the guys that the platoon was a designated breacher. One of the guys that the platoon was a, was the sniper.

1379
01:44:20.64 --> 01:44:26.64
Well, why don't we take guys that do a lot of sniper work and make them the world class snipers and then world class breachers.

1380
01:44:26.64 --> 01:44:31.64
That evolved and then all said 9, 11 hits and it went on steroids.

1381
01:44:31.64 --> 01:44:49.64
But before I jumped over a part when you were sealed of sealed team three, one thing I used to tell guys all the time was if we were doing an off, if we're doing a water up, I'd say, hey, if you're in the water, it's a real world up because if you're in the water, you can die period.

1382
01:44:49.64 --> 01:44:51.64
And you bow died.

1383
01:44:51.64 --> 01:44:52.64
About that.

1384
01:44:52.64 --> 01:45:01.64
And the three as the commanding officer up in, was it Moral Bay? Moral Bay. Cap size didn't ribb. Yeah, that was not a good day.

1385
01:45:01.64 --> 01:45:04.64
Except I came out of a lot of some of it was good day.

1386
01:45:04.64 --> 01:45:08.64
Yeah, we went up there. It was one of the platoon. It was doing their final exercise before deploying.

1387
01:45:08.64 --> 01:45:13.64
And as you know, the commanding officer generally comes up for the FTX, the final training exercise.

1388
01:45:13.64 --> 01:45:24.64
So we'd gone up to Moral Bay myself and the commanding master. And the platoon was still doing some training that we're going to do the FTX, I think, following day.

1389
01:45:24.64 --> 01:45:32.64
And there had been a storm off the coast. So Moral Bay's got this thing that looks a little bit like the rocket Gibraltar kind of right in the middle Moral Bay.

1390
01:45:32.64 --> 01:45:34.64
But what it does is it funnels the waves.

1391
01:45:34.64 --> 01:45:40.64
So the storm surge off the coast had created these huge waves breaking coming into Moral Bay.

1392
01:45:40.64 --> 01:45:46.64
Well, there was a place inside Moral Bay where the seals were trained. And so they were kind of in their zodiacs doing their regular training.

1393
01:45:46.64 --> 01:45:53.64
But I noticed, as I was getting out to go with the platoon, that I saw two ribs out there. They didn't belong to me. They belonged to the special boat unit.

1394
01:45:53.64 --> 01:46:00.64
But I'm kind of looking thinking, WTF, what are these guys playing on doing? Because I'm looking at 20 foot waves breaking here.

1395
01:46:00.64 --> 01:46:07.64
And so I'm with one of the seals that said, run me out to that boat out there.

1396
01:46:07.64 --> 01:46:13.64
So they zip me out there and I get on the rib and I'm talking to a young lieutenant surface warfare officer.

1397
01:46:13.64 --> 01:46:19.64
And I said, so what's planned here, son? And he says, we're going to go out through the waves.

1398
01:46:19.64 --> 01:46:22.64
You're going to go through those waves.

1399
01:46:22.64 --> 01:46:26.64
So I've got to plan. I got my CMC fees on the jetty. He's timing the waves.

1400
01:46:26.64 --> 01:46:28.64
We're actually not going to go straight out through.

1401
01:46:28.64 --> 01:46:31.64
And we're going to cut around near the jetty just as it's breaking.

1402
01:46:31.64 --> 01:46:36.64
And by the way, all my guys are trained in Codiac. We can do this.

1403
01:46:36.64 --> 01:46:40.64
Okay, well, give me a life jacket. I'll go with you.

1404
01:46:40.64 --> 01:46:47.64
And of course, there are two seals in the back of the boat. Tom Reinville and Juno Polusa.

1405
01:46:47.64 --> 01:46:53.64
And so Juno, you may know, has got quite a sense of humor. He's like, hey, sir, come on. Let's go.

1406
01:46:53.64 --> 01:46:57.64
And he said, you know, I didn't have a dry suit on. The water temperature was in the 50s.

1407
01:46:57.64 --> 01:47:01.64
And he said, yeah, if we tip, you know, you're going to get off the coldest.

1408
01:47:01.64 --> 01:47:06.64
And then don't capsize the boat. So we're in the back of three of us or three seals are kind of in the back of the boat.

1409
01:47:06.64 --> 01:47:10.64
And the bolster seats back there. And, you know, we're all kind of timing the waves.

1410
01:47:10.64 --> 01:47:14.64
This team values team to do. And Frank, the waves are getting kind of bigger and bigger.

1411
01:47:14.64 --> 01:47:17.64
And all of a sudden, the coxon guns it.

1412
01:47:17.64 --> 01:47:20.64
Whoa. And he had straight for the wave.

1413
01:47:20.64 --> 01:47:25.64
And I mean, we hit this first wave. We go straight up the first wave at about 30 knots.

1414
01:47:25.64 --> 01:47:33.64
And I literally am counting like he do when you jump out on the static line. I go 1,000, 2,000, 3000, 4000.

1415
01:47:33.64 --> 01:47:38.64
Bam! We hit in between the first and the second wave.

1416
01:47:38.64 --> 01:47:44.64
Well, the ballman he goes flying off. He's lost one of the engines.

1417
01:47:44.64 --> 01:47:48.64
Now he does the right thing. The coxon swings the boat around because we've got no choice now.

1418
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:53.64
So he guns it to try to beat the second wave. Well, the second wave, you know, is waves tend to get bigger and bigger.

1419
01:47:53.64 --> 01:48:00.64
The second wave is probably 30 somewhat feet. And he hits it again. And we hit it full speed. And we go up in the air.

1420
01:48:00.64 --> 01:48:07.64
And this time, I literally count to 5,000, 1,000, 2,000, 3000, 4000, 4000, 5000.

1421
01:48:07.64 --> 01:48:12.64
5,000, we hit. It's like holy shit. Hit the boat cracks. Guys are thrown out.

1422
01:48:12.64 --> 01:48:16.64
And now all of a sudden, the wave of the day comes, you know.

1423
01:48:16.64 --> 01:48:19.64
So the boat is facing the sub, but now we got no power.

1424
01:48:19.64 --> 01:48:24.64
And that third wave just lifts that boat up. And I can remember seeing it. As the boats get lifted up.

1425
01:48:24.64 --> 01:48:31.64
And, you know, there's water coming over the 33 foot boat. And there's another, you know, eight foot of water coming over the top of the other thing.

1426
01:48:31.64 --> 01:48:34.64
And it just bang. Throw us right on the back.

1427
01:48:34.64 --> 01:48:42.64
Well, I'm underneath the boat. And I'm tangled up in shot line. And you know, shot line is this kind of very thin nylon line.

1428
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:45.64
It's wrapped around my neck. I've got somebody's weapon is wrapped around me.

1429
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:49.64
And I am, I mean, I am completely tangled underneath this rib.

1430
01:48:49.64 --> 01:48:53.64
And again, much like, you know, times that you have in the teams.

1431
01:48:53.64 --> 01:48:57.64
Most of the times you can, you can get your way out of these things.

1432
01:48:57.64 --> 01:49:03.64
And, and so I'm under the boat. And I'm, I'm trying to extricate myself in this thing.

1433
01:49:03.64 --> 01:49:06.64
But it's, it's choking me. And I'm losing air.

1434
01:49:06.64 --> 01:49:10.64
And I remember thinking myself. So this is how it's going to end.

1435
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:16.64
I mean, all this time, I'm going to die under this damn boat. And I remember saying to myself,

1436
01:49:16.64 --> 01:49:22.64
Well, I'm never going to see Georgian, Bill, John, or Kelly again, my wife and the re-kids.

1437
01:49:22.64 --> 01:49:29.64
And, and as I am struggling, again, to this day, I actually, I used the word in the book,

1438
01:49:29.64 --> 01:49:33.64
miraculously, I'm untangled.

1439
01:49:33.64 --> 01:49:39.64
That should never have happened. I mean, I was so wrapped up in shot line in somebody's sling in the bolster.

1440
01:49:39.64 --> 01:49:44.64
And I'm all sitting in the bolster seat, things. And all of a sudden, I'm loose.

1441
01:49:44.64 --> 01:49:50.64
And I shoot to the surface. And, well, now, I'm in the second set of waves coming again.

1442
01:49:50.64 --> 01:49:55.64
And I'm thinking, oh, I'm not going to make this. And there's two seals who had seen this,

1443
01:49:55.64 --> 01:50:00.64
seen the boat flip over. They're in a zodiac in their UDT's from trucks.

1444
01:50:00.64 --> 01:50:03.64
And they come haul and ask out of nowhere. And they're yelling at me.

1445
01:50:03.64 --> 01:50:07.64
Skipper, skipper. I can hear them. And I'm thinking, you better get her fast.

1446
01:50:07.64 --> 01:50:11.64
Cause I'm not going to survive this next wave. And they come, I don't even get in the boat.

1447
01:50:11.64 --> 01:50:17.64
The guy does a literal U-turn, you know, a sliding turn. I grab the side of the, the, the, the, the, the sponsor there.

1448
01:50:17.64 --> 01:50:22.64
Hang on. And I can remember the prop is, is hit my general boots that I've got on.

1449
01:50:22.64 --> 01:50:27.64
And they pull me out of the wave just before it crashes over the top of me.

1450
01:50:27.64 --> 01:50:30.64
And they had pulled the Tom Rain, another group had pulled Tom Rainville out.

1451
01:50:30.64 --> 01:50:45.64
And they went back to the second chance. I mean, it was once again, that could have been the end of my career.

1452
01:50:45.64 --> 01:50:50.64
And, you know, there were people that thought highly enough. And they went back.

1453
01:50:50.64 --> 01:50:54.64
I mean, they did the investigation. Everybody, we talked to everything.

1454
01:50:54.64 --> 01:50:58.64
And the, the teams to their credit. And they did the investigation said, you know,

1455
01:50:58.64 --> 01:51:06.64
you know, this is what we expect of our operators. The lieutenant who was the, the surface warfare officer.

1456
01:51:06.64 --> 01:51:12.64
I mean, we expect them to push the envelope. Yeah, this is, and a lot of times you're going to have these expectations.

1457
01:51:12.64 --> 01:51:15.64
Guys, going to push the envelope and it's not always going to work out well.

1458
01:51:15.64 --> 01:51:24.64
So to the credit of, you know, the admiral and the Commodore, we all from a career standpoint survived it.

1459
01:51:24.64 --> 01:51:31.64
And so we've been fast forward again about 20, some odd years after the book comes out, I get an email.

1460
01:51:31.64 --> 01:51:37.64
And, and the guy says, sir, you know, this is so-and-so, lieutenant Jones.

1461
01:51:37.64 --> 01:51:42.64
Of course, I didn't name the name the young lieutenant. He said that I won't go into too much details.

1462
01:51:42.64 --> 01:51:45.64
But he said, I love the story. It's exactly how I remembered it.

1463
01:51:45.64 --> 01:51:52.64
And just wanted to reconnect with you and say thanks for everything. And he had, again, because he, he had been the boat all I see.

1464
01:51:52.64 --> 01:51:59.64
By Navy rigs, the boat I see actually is the guy responsible. But I, the thing that I admired about this young man is, so he loses the boat.

1465
01:51:59.64 --> 01:52:05.64
And, you know, he's got to see, I mean, one, he does the right thing. He makes sure he's got a head count on guys.

1466
01:52:05.64 --> 01:52:11.64
He gets guys out. He gets a metovac to the hospital. And he takes a meet charge of the situation.

1467
01:52:11.64 --> 01:52:17.64
It gets the boat off the bottom. Does everything right after the disaster.

1468
01:52:17.64 --> 01:52:22.64
And you've seen it before. Sometimes guys have a disaster like that, and they just, they're crushed by it.

1469
01:52:22.64 --> 01:52:26.64
And they can't think and they can't operate and they can't take a man.

1470
01:52:26.64 --> 01:52:30.64
The young lieutenant did exactly what he was supposed to do. I mean, sometimes bad things happen.

1471
01:52:30.64 --> 01:52:34.64
And then you got to kind of, you got a man up and get the job done. And he did.

1472
01:52:34.64 --> 01:52:39.64
And I think the investigation board saw that and gave him another opportunity.

1473
01:52:39.64 --> 01:52:48.64
You're, you know, like I, I look at your life and I think, you know, really had some good luck in his life.

1474
01:52:48.64 --> 01:52:51.64
But also reading your book, I think, damn.

1475
01:52:51.64 --> 01:52:59.64
Because one of the next stories in your career was you basically got drawn and cordured by your parachutes, which,

1476
01:52:59.64 --> 01:53:02.64
I, you had a parachute.

1477
01:53:02.64 --> 01:53:05.64
So you take over the, you take over the, what's called Naval Special Warfare Group One,

1478
01:53:05.64 --> 01:53:10.64
which is the person that's in charge of all the seal teams on the west coast and all their training,

1479
01:53:10.64 --> 01:53:14.64
Manning and equipping and overseeing and giving them guidance.

1480
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:19.64
And you go out on a parachute jump for whatever reason, because that's what we do.

1481
01:53:19.64 --> 01:53:25.64
And you, you, you, you, you about got drawn and cordured from the story.

1482
01:53:25.64 --> 01:53:27.64
It sounds like you about got ripped in half.

1483
01:53:27.64 --> 01:53:29.64
That's about right.

1484
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:37.64
Yeah, so this was a routine parachute jump and, and I'm not a good jumper, not a good free faller, but you know, something you got to do.

1485
01:53:37.64 --> 01:53:45.64
So we go out and launch out of North Island on a C130 and get up to about 13,000 feet, and it's going to be again a routine jump.

1486
01:53:45.64 --> 01:53:51.64
Ram comes down and it's something that's one of these chamber of commerce days here in Southern California, not a cloud in the sky.

1487
01:53:51.64 --> 01:53:57.64
I remember you can see Mexico, you can see the Pacific Ocean, you can see the strand, it's like, that's a beautiful day.

1488
01:53:57.64 --> 01:54:00.64
And I'm a fourth in the line of March so to speak.

1489
01:54:00.64 --> 01:54:06.64
So the guys go out and something else goes through the call, I go up behind these guys and I'm falling flat and stable and looking good.

1490
01:54:06.64 --> 01:54:10.64
And there's two guys off to my left and one guy off to my right.

1491
01:54:10.64 --> 01:54:16.64
And I'm watching the sky off to my right and he's starting to kind of drift underneath me and I'm kind of watching him, but then he's stabilized.

1492
01:54:16.64 --> 01:54:20.64
Next thing I know the guy to my left is right underneath me and I check my altitude later.

1493
01:54:20.64 --> 01:54:26.64
It's about 500 feet. He pulls his parachute and in relative terms, course I'm moving to the 120 miles an hour.

1494
01:54:26.64 --> 01:54:30.64
He's stopped. I can't get out of the way and I hit his parachute.

1495
01:54:30.64 --> 01:54:32.64
It's kind of like hitting an airbag I would assume.

1496
01:54:32.64 --> 01:54:35.64
And so it dases me and now I'm spinning out of control.

1497
01:54:35.64 --> 01:54:39.64
As you know what I should have done is gotten stable again.

1498
01:54:39.64 --> 01:54:41.64
Look, check my altitude and I pulled my rip cord.

1499
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:44.64
But, you know, things being what they were.

1500
01:54:44.64 --> 01:54:49.64
I'm spinning, I'm days, I'm like, hey, I just know I got to reach for my rip cord or this isn't going to end well.

1501
01:54:49.64 --> 01:54:52.64
So I reached my rip cord, pull it.

1502
01:54:52.64 --> 01:54:57.64
Well, I'm in a head down attitude spinning. Pilot shoot comes out, wraps around one leg.

1503
01:54:57.64 --> 01:55:00.64
The riser comes out, wraps around another leg.

1504
01:55:00.64 --> 01:55:03.64
Now I'm completely tangled up in the parachute. I remember playing myself.

1505
01:55:03.64 --> 01:55:05.64
Yeah, it doesn't look so good.

1506
01:55:05.64 --> 01:55:11.64
So, you know, I'm sitting here trying to get my way out of the parachute or at least get the damn thing to open.

1507
01:55:11.64 --> 01:55:14.64
Well, the good news is it opens.

1508
01:55:14.64 --> 01:55:17.64
The bad news is when a parachute opens, you know, it blossoms.

1509
01:55:17.64 --> 01:55:22.64
So one riser went one way, one went the other way and it snapped my pelvis into.

1510
01:55:22.64 --> 01:55:24.64
Broke it by about four or five inches.

1511
01:55:24.64 --> 01:55:28.64
Fraction, my back ripped the muscles out of my stomach that's attached to the,

1512
01:55:28.64 --> 01:55:31.64
the boony part of your pelvis and ripped the muscles out of legs.

1513
01:55:31.64 --> 01:55:34.64
And I ended up about, about two miles from the drop zone.

1514
01:55:34.64 --> 01:55:37.64
Now I'm always quick to point out, like this kind of injury,

1515
01:55:37.64 --> 01:55:40.64
pales in comparison to what we saw in Iraq, what we saw in Afghanistan.

1516
01:55:40.64 --> 01:55:45.64
And the lessons, you know, from the jump, we're not so much about the accident.

1517
01:55:45.64 --> 01:55:48.64
But it was really more about the fact that, you know, at the time,

1518
01:55:48.64 --> 01:55:50.64
you're pointing out, I'm the Commodore.

1519
01:55:50.64 --> 01:55:53.64
I mean, I'm one of the senior guys in the West Coast.

1520
01:55:53.64 --> 01:55:56.64
I've been in the business for 20 some ideas.

1521
01:55:56.64 --> 01:55:58.64
I'd had a lot of near-death experiences.

1522
01:55:58.64 --> 01:56:01.64
I was pretty savvy. I thought I was invincible sort of thing.

1523
01:56:01.64 --> 01:56:06.64
And the next thing, you know, you're in the ER in the hospital and you're laid up.

1524
01:56:06.64 --> 01:56:10.64
And you realize it takes a whole lot of people to get you back up going again.

1525
01:56:10.64 --> 01:56:14.64
My wife became my nurse because once I got out of the hospital, you know, you got to get shots and make sure you don't.

1526
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:19.64
You're blooded in clot, Admiral Eric Olson made sure I was able to stay in the Navy and back then.

1527
01:56:19.64 --> 01:56:23.64
That was touching go because, you know, you're pretty serious accident.

1528
01:56:23.64 --> 01:56:24.64
By the way, you're a Navy seal.

1529
01:56:24.64 --> 01:56:30.64
What good are you going to do if you can't walk and you can't run and team guys being team guys.

1530
01:56:30.64 --> 01:56:33.64
They came by, gave me the right amount of harassment, the right amount of encouragement.

1531
01:56:33.64 --> 01:56:38.64
And it really did take a lot of people to kind of get me up and go in again.

1532
01:56:38.64 --> 01:56:48.64
And it really was about just this remarkable, you know, group of folks that we are honored to be part of and how they took care of me right about time I needed.

1533
01:56:48.64 --> 01:56:51.64
And of course, that was what July 2001.

1534
01:56:51.64 --> 01:56:52.64
It was.

1535
01:56:52.64 --> 01:56:56.64
Yeah, so I was laid up about, and then of course, 9-11 happens.

1536
01:56:56.64 --> 01:57:00.64
And I'm actually kind of recuperating in my house.

1537
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:07.64
And we'd wheeled the hospital bed into my house that her and Coronado, and they were at the Naval Base when 9-11 was happening.

1538
01:57:07.64 --> 01:57:22.64
And, and, and about of month or so later, I got called to go to the White House and weighing down in and for our listeners, he was a retired four star general who had run US special operations command.

1539
01:57:22.64 --> 01:57:29.64
He got asked by President Bush to be in charge of the office combatting terrorism, which was had been newly established after 9-11.

1540
01:57:29.64 --> 01:57:33.64
And down he gets hold of me and says, hey, I like you to come work for me.

1541
01:57:33.64 --> 01:57:43.64
And he knew I'd been in the accident and of course, that point time, and I can't go back to an operational team as much as I wanted to and I thought, well, you know, this will maybe give me a chance to heal.

1542
01:57:43.64 --> 01:57:48.64
And while I got to the White House didn't have any time to any rehab, you know, you just went right to work.

1543
01:57:48.64 --> 01:57:52.64
But I had to park on what was called the Olympics, which was outside the White House.

1544
01:57:52.64 --> 01:57:57.64
And it was about, you know, 600 and half a mile maybe into the White House every day.

1545
01:57:57.64 --> 01:58:02.64
And that became my P.T. was getting out of the car and going, man, that's a long way to walk, you know.

1546
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:06.64
But a little bit of your body heals and did back to work.

1547
01:58:06.64 --> 01:58:11.64
So now you're, and this is a, he said something that reminded me, so I've worked for Adam and Wichweir.

1548
01:58:11.64 --> 01:58:19.64
Well, I was his aide, not at this time, but one thing that he had gotten when September 11th happened, he was working to acquisition, right?

1549
01:58:19.64 --> 01:58:24.64
At the Pentagon or something like that. And I, he told me, you know, his attitude was, okay.

1550
01:58:24.64 --> 01:58:33.64
I want to go to a team, I want to deploy, which is what every team guy thinks, but he just said, you know, okay, well, this is my foxhole.

1551
01:58:33.64 --> 01:58:39.64
Acquisitions. I'm going to get money for the teams. That's what I'm going to do. And that was sort of the same attitude that it looked like you had.

1552
01:58:39.64 --> 01:58:43.64
I was like, okay, this is what I'm going to do. Well, that's going to do it to the best of my ability.

1553
01:58:43.64 --> 01:58:49.64
You, you do talk about, um, there's, there's a hostage situation. Was it Martin and Grott?

1554
01:58:49.64 --> 01:58:51.64
Yeah, Martin and Grisha, Barnum.

1555
01:58:51.64 --> 01:58:56.64
It was interesting and, you know, get the book. It's, it's fascinating how you put that together.

1556
01:58:56.64 --> 01:59:06.64
But one thing that I found interesting about it, it's a good lesson learned for people is it was something that was kind of on the, you know, on the back burner and people weren't focused on it.

1557
01:59:06.64 --> 01:59:09.64
And here you had two Americans that were being held hostage.

1558
01:59:09.64 --> 01:59:18.64
And like I said, it was on the back burner and you sort of became a champion for, hey, we need to do something about this.

1559
01:59:18.64 --> 01:59:28.64
And that had a huge impact. And eventually, you know, a rescue mission was undertaken, unfortunately, the husband was killed, but the wife survived.

1560
01:59:28.64 --> 01:59:40.64
And, but one person can make a huge difference. And, and you can be, you can be a champion for a cause and have a real impact, which is, and you know, it's not like you would have seen your guy there or anything like that.

1561
01:59:40.64 --> 01:59:47.64
But you, you grabbed onto this cause. You know, it was the right thing to do and let it. I thought that was a, that's a powerful thing to think about.

1562
01:59:47.64 --> 01:59:54.64
Well, particularly, you know, I was in the White House. So, you're, you are close to the, you know, the decision makers on these things.

1563
01:59:54.64 --> 01:59:59.64
And, and I realized that it had an opt-in. Now, I'm a Navy captain, so I'm fairly senior at the time.

1564
01:59:59.64 --> 02:00:07.64
But when the burn-ups had been held hostage for six or seven months before I even arrived there, and I was stunned frankly that we, the United States,

1565
02:00:07.64 --> 02:00:15.64
It's not that we weren't doing anything, but I didn't think we were doing enough. And, you know, having been in the kind of hostage rescue business, I knew what was, the art of the possible.

1566
02:00:15.64 --> 02:00:23.64
And, and so there was, I think, all the hostage subcommittee, which by virtue of my position, I was in charge of it. And it was an interagency committee.

1567
02:00:23.64 --> 02:00:29.64
But to your point, Jogger, yeah, you have an opportunity, no matter where you are in the chain of command, you can make a difference.

1568
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:41.64
And I was fortunate enough to be able to get in a pretty present bush and to, you know, have the ear of Dr. County Rice, who was an national security advisor and ambassadors from that perch in the White House,

1569
02:00:41.64 --> 02:01:04.64
to be able to try to orchestrate something on behalf of the burn-ups. And so it was a pretty fulfilling, again, we were, we were sorry, we couldn't, you know, get Martin rescued, but I remember I never, never met Gracia, but there's several months after, after she had been rescued.

1570
02:01:04.64 --> 02:01:14.64
And I was just sitting in my cubicle there in the White House and the phone rang, and she was on the other end and, you know, thanking me. That's like, you know, thank me.

1571
02:01:14.64 --> 02:01:25.64
I mean, this is, I'm sorry we couldn't rescue your husband. She was just, she's a remarkable woman, you know, just her faith sustained her through, you know, that year and a half in the jungle.

1572
02:01:25.64 --> 02:01:37.64
But, but yeah, the best thing about working the White House was almost like the issue with a Pentagon, and this really did serve me well, because two years in the White House, nine new how the White House worked.

1573
02:01:37.64 --> 02:01:48.64
And so when I became Deputy J. Sock Commander and then the J. Sock Commander, now you know how to get decisions made, you know what, what the inter-ADC process works, it looks like.

1574
02:01:48.64 --> 02:01:58.64
You know, who all the players are, and in fact most of the players, a lot of the players that I had served with on the National Security Council staff, then a couple years later there, there's somebody else important.

1575
02:01:58.64 --> 02:02:03.64
And so you can back to those relationships, you can leverage those relationships and a positive fashion.

1576
02:02:03.64 --> 02:02:11.64
So understanding how the White House worked, and also the great relationships I had built served me well, and a number of my commands.

1577
02:02:11.64 --> 02:02:21.64
When you in between being the Deputy J. Sock Commander and leaving the White House, did you go to Sockier for that? So you did a tour at Sockier, was that like your standard two year tour?

1578
02:02:21.64 --> 02:02:33.64
It was two year tour, but I was fortunate at the time. I had a great Army Colonel of Work for me named Stu Bridden, and Stu came to me with this idea that we needed to stand up a NATO special operations force.

1579
02:02:33.64 --> 02:02:47.64
Well, the folks in NATO, the bureaucrats did not want to do that, but Stu understood how to make this happen. And once again, I was fortunate. General Jim Jones was the U.C. Commander, the SAC-UR Commander at the time.

1580
02:02:47.64 --> 02:03:02.64
We pitched the plan to him, and he supported it. And as a result, we were able to stand up in 2006, the NATO Special Operations Force, that today has got 22, 24 countries that are part of NATO's soft.

1581
02:03:02.64 --> 02:03:13.64
And of course, they deployed with his overseas in Afghanistan, and continued to be a great partner. And a lot of that credit goes right back to Stu Bridden and the great work he did.

1582
02:03:13.64 --> 02:03:30.64
From there, you go to J. Sock. You take over as the Deputy Commander. And I think you throw out in sea stories. You give an example, which I think is a...

1583
02:03:30.64 --> 02:03:45.64
Well, it's pretty important story. There's a mission going on. You're in the... you're in the talk, the TAC-Coperation Center. And here we go. I'm going to go to the book. This is from Sea Stories. Unbeknownst to me, Lieutenant Colonel Bill Coltrup.

1584
02:03:45.64 --> 02:04:13.64
The Sea Squadron Commander and Colonel Jim Hickey from First Brigade 4th Infantry Division had maneuvered farther up the dirt road from Wolverine 1, which was one target, two another small house designated Wolverine 2. As I watched the ISR feed from the Westcam and listened to the radios, the visual and verbal didn't match up. Wolverine 1 appeared reasonably quiet. But the radio calls from Coltrup sounded like they were moving rapidly on a target.

1585
02:04:13.64 --> 02:04:24.64
It sounds like they're on targetly. I don't see any movement outside the house. I motioned to the Jock non-commission officer who sat at the end of the long wooden table that made a horseshoe around the ISR screen.

1586
02:04:24.64 --> 02:04:33.64
So you're sitting there watching this thing unfold the ISR's, what's the feed that's coming from the aircraft overhead. He was also on the headset seeing what I was seeing, which was nothing.

1587
02:04:33.64 --> 02:04:46.64
I raised my hands in the universal sign of WTF and he shrugged and called back ISR's on the target. I don't know where the squadron is sir. I hated to call the squadron in the middle of an operation.

1588
02:04:46.64 --> 02:04:56.64
And that's an important point from my perspective. I was a Platoon Commander and I was a Force Commander and a Platoon and then a Tasking Commander.

1589
02:04:56.64 --> 02:05:09.64
And the fact that you weren't jumping on there, hey, where are you at? What's going on? What's going on? What's going on? Is is I'd say if you've got a boss, you got at least a 50% chance of a boss that wants to know exactly where you are at all time.

1590
02:05:09.64 --> 02:05:20.64
And it's not fun and it doesn't help. And so here you are. You say I hated to call the squadron in the middle of an operation. It's the last thing any tactical guy on the ground wants a call from his boss.

1591
02:05:20.64 --> 02:05:29.64
And the important comfortable in the jock 50 miles away from the action. Still, it was our responsibility to manage the quick reaction force and the medical evacuation of something went wrong on target.

1592
02:05:29.64 --> 02:05:33.64
That was hard to do if you didn't have good situational awareness of the mission.

1593
02:05:33.64 --> 02:05:39.64
And the truth was, I was curious as to whether this new lead was panning out so they were tracking a lead.

1594
02:05:39.64 --> 02:05:52.64
Some somewhat reluctantly, I pushed the talk, I pushed the talk button and reached out to Coltrip Bill, are you on target? Yes, sir. Coltrip responded somewhat excitedly. We don't see you on ISR.

1595
02:05:52.64 --> 02:06:06.64
There was a pause on Coltrip's end. Sir, we are on Wolverine 2, just down the road from the original target. And we have Jackpot. Jackpot. Jackpot was the code word, meaning they had captured the objective.

1596
02:06:06.64 --> 02:06:10.64
But first, I assumed Coltrip meant cases that who you were looking for.

1597
02:06:10.64 --> 02:06:17.64
But suddenly, it occurred to me that the tone of Coltrip's voice indicated something more significant.

1598
02:06:17.64 --> 02:06:24.64
Jackpot. Do you mean little jackpot or big jackpot? Big jackpot, Coltrip answered.

1599
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:29.64
And going as this goes forward, big jackpot was set on.

1600
02:06:29.64 --> 02:06:40.64
So these guys had just captured Saddam. And I was actually, I was in Iraq at the time. And so we had found out, I think we had found out, we found out really quickly.

1601
02:06:40.64 --> 02:06:48.64
One of the guys that we were working, one of the OGA guys we were working out with was one of the early interrogators on them and come down.

1602
02:06:48.64 --> 02:07:00.64
And we got them. So as much as I know you were trying to keep the secret, there was, it didn't stay so long. That one didn't stay secret very long.

1603
02:07:00.64 --> 02:07:05.64
I know there's a, there's a, before we jump in a little bit about Saddam.

1604
02:07:05.64 --> 02:07:13.64
So when you, when you were running that earlier, I mentioned you were running this project of like looking at the future of warfare and what we could do. And I was part of that.

1605
02:07:13.64 --> 02:07:29.64
So I was, I knew it's like five of us and you were basically taking us and sending us to all these very cool, probably some of the best schools I ever went to. I went to lock picking and car stealing and just all these really cool school schools to get us prepared to do.

1606
02:07:29.64 --> 02:07:36.64
Like you said, operations from a totally different perspective. And I remember I sat through your brief a couple times.

1607
02:07:36.64 --> 02:07:50.64
And you would brief, you know, some senior officers and you'd say, hey, listen, in the sealed teams, we do direct action, but we have T-Lam's now. And so do we really need to do direct shot or all we really going to have to do direct action missions when we've got T-Lams.

1608
02:07:50.64 --> 02:08:03.64
And we've got another thing we do is, special reconnaissance. Well, are we really going to do need to do special reconnaissance when we've got satellites and, and we've got, you know, UAV capabilities are coming on board.

1609
02:08:03.64 --> 02:08:11.64
And you know, I remember like I said, I was a young guy and thinking, okay, well, I need to transfer to this new format. We're not going to do direct action anymore.

1610
02:08:11.64 --> 02:08:24.64
I think the next time I saw you as in Baghdad, you came down to Camp Jenny Pose. You were, we were, I was jokped up literally about to go out on my whatever 50th or whatever direct action mission.

1611
02:08:24.64 --> 02:08:29.64
And, and I thought it was funny. I kind of smiled at myself said, well, looks like we're still doing it.

1612
02:08:29.64 --> 02:08:43.64
I thought I was doing it. But, but this mission got Saddam and then, I mean, you do, it's a very interesting perspective. How, how crazy is it to sit here and talk to you.

1613
02:08:43.64 --> 02:08:55.64
You are interacting with Saddam when he got captured and you detailed it in the book. But I mean, just some some high level thoughts. What was that like detailed with this freaking horrible, horrible, sadistic person.

1614
02:08:55.64 --> 02:09:02.64
Yeah, it was very interesting because the, you know, when we first captured him, I mean, he was pop-up, he was arrogant.

1615
02:09:02.64 --> 02:09:12.64
When, when, when Bill called back, when Bill called to call back and said, they were got a big jackpot. Could your point you had asked about case or case was the guy we were the facilitator.

1616
02:09:12.64 --> 02:09:20.64
So we were trying to get the facilitator who we thought was going to lead us to Saddam. Well, they had gotten case and in case it had kind of pointed them towards Saddam and they opened the spider hole you've seen the picture.

1617
02:09:20.64 --> 02:09:29.64
Saddam's in there. So they bring Saddam back to, to crit and, and I'm down and back dead. And, and so now we had a plan.

1618
02:09:29.64 --> 02:09:35.64
Okay, what do you do if you get Saddam where I had to call a general abysad who was a cent-com commander called General McCristo, who was my boss back and Tampa.

1619
02:09:35.64 --> 02:09:44.64
And, and I had to make plans to, well, we want to verify that Saddam. So I needed to get DNA sent to, you know, the lab and FBI lab and all that sort of thing.

1620
02:09:44.64 --> 02:09:59.64
But, but as all this has happened in, the, the JTF commander, General Rick Sanchez, I get the word General Sanchez is outside the job.

1621
02:09:59.64 --> 02:10:08.64
I was like, what? I mean, he was the big guy in Iraq down three-star at the time and so, bring him on in. So Sanchez comes in, sits down beside me and says,

1622
02:10:08.64 --> 02:10:18.64
I don't understand you got to Saddam, I said, I do not know that yet. I'm not going to call a jackpot until I can see it till we can verify it.

1623
02:10:18.64 --> 02:10:24.64
You know how this goes? You know, there are a lot of times we had captured guys who we thought had the right name. The cronyas were different.

1624
02:10:24.64 --> 02:10:28.64
People were different. You call a jackpot then you're embarrassed, you know, twenty-five or three or one's not the right guy.

1625
02:10:28.64 --> 02:10:35.64
And he says, hey, no, I mean, I, I heard through, you know, through OGA that the, that's got him. I said, well, so he'll be down here in 30 minutes.

1626
02:10:35.64 --> 02:10:39.64
You can see for yourself. I think we both just spotted the Lee Khan.

1627
02:10:39.64 --> 02:10:47.64
Well, so, so the, about 30 minutes later, the Hellower Rives, well, I mean, I'm busy making phone calls.

1628
02:10:47.64 --> 02:10:52.64
So I turned to my chief of staff who I call him, I think, captain Lee at his request.

1629
02:10:52.64 --> 02:10:58.64
And I said, hey, go over there. You've got to come back and I'm trusting you tell me what you think it's Saddam or not.

1630
02:10:58.64 --> 02:11:03.64
So he and General Sanchez go over there and he comes back from his later goes, sorry, it's Saddam.

1631
02:11:03.64 --> 02:11:09.64
Okay, so I know I'm calling Habes and doing my sort of thing. Well, about, you know, half an hour later, I go back over there.

1632
02:11:09.64 --> 02:11:15.64
And I remember talking to Sanchez was kind of one of those funny moments. So Saddam has this big beard.

1633
02:11:15.64 --> 02:11:21.64
And, and I realized we got to get him cleaned up because we're going to have this kind of press release and everything.

1634
02:11:21.64 --> 02:11:26.64
And frankly, it looked like Saddam, even with a big beard. He's got this bulbous nose, everything.

1635
02:11:26.64 --> 02:11:30.64
But I figured, well, let's get him cleaned up. So no Iraqis can say it's not Saddam.

1636
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:38.64
So I turned to one of the guys and said, okay, let's get him shaved and get him cleaned up and then we'll take a picture and then we'll be able to compare it.

1637
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:45.64
So as I'm saying, Sanchez turns to me says, I don't know, Bill, do we have the authority to shave him?

1638
02:11:45.64 --> 02:11:54.64
As a certain, we had the authority to kill him if he was trying to guess. I think we got the authority to shave. We both got a laugh. I really liked Rick Sanchez. He was a good guy.

1639
02:11:54.64 --> 02:12:04.64
So I go off, make some more fun calls. I come back assuming that what had happened was some range or somebody had gotten the shares and was kind of cleaning Saddam.

1640
02:12:04.64 --> 02:12:10.64
Why come back? So I'm just got a pair of scissors in the sand and he's clipping his own beard. I'm like, no, let me have this.

1641
02:12:10.64 --> 02:12:14.64
Yeah, it's just yeah, pull that away. And he's like, oh, yeah, I was holding it cleaned up.

1642
02:12:14.64 --> 02:12:26.64
But the next day was the day when you recall the press conference where the ambassador and Joel Sanchez say, we got him. Well, they hadn't seen him. Sanchez had seen him, but the ambassador hadn't seen him yet.

1643
02:12:26.64 --> 02:12:33.64
So they fly out to our place there and bagged at and go to see Saddam and they brought some of the Iraqi leaders with him.

1644
02:12:33.64 --> 02:12:37.64
And again, Saddam, I've got him now in a jumpsuit and he's sitting on a cot.

1645
02:12:37.64 --> 02:12:43.64
But when they, when the Iraqi leaders came into the room, small room, about the size actually.

1646
02:12:43.64 --> 02:12:53.64
I mean, they are yelling at him. They're spit netting him. And he's got this look on his face like boys. I'm still in charge or Saddam. And he kind of motioned to him. He's just Saddam.

1647
02:12:53.64 --> 02:13:01.64
Don't you know who I am? I'm looking at thinking, wow. He is he still thinks he's in charge. He's about to find out he's no longer in charge.

1648
02:13:01.64 --> 02:13:13.64
So I didn't really want to bring those guys in because I knew this would happen. It was just bolster his ego. So after after they left, I talked to Sanchez, Dr. Ambassador said, so that's it.

1649
02:13:13.64 --> 02:13:17.64
I don't want anybody else visiting him. I am responsible for him now.

1650
02:13:17.64 --> 02:13:23.64
I mean, and call it General Labs, he will tell you, I'm responsible for him. So here's what I'm telling you. Nobody else visiting.

1651
02:13:23.64 --> 02:13:31.64
We will, you know, I will take good care of him, but I don't want him, you know, feel like he's somebody important. So the next 30 days I held onto him.

1652
02:13:31.64 --> 02:13:39.64
And in the room, I had an officer and a security guy and a medic and a doctor all the time.

1653
02:13:39.64 --> 02:13:43.64
Because he was 67 years old and he had all sorts of health problems.

1654
02:13:43.64 --> 02:13:52.64
But it was interesting to watch. As the days and weeks went on and he no longer had his, you know, palaces and no longer had his generals and no longer had his hand made.

1655
02:13:52.64 --> 02:14:01.64
He really just became a pathetic old man. And every time I come in, every, I go check on him every day. He'd always stand up to want to talk to me.

1656
02:14:01.64 --> 02:14:13.64
And I wouldn't talk to him. And he would talk to the Rangers and the doc. And I told him I said, I don't want anybody to say an award to him.

1657
02:14:13.64 --> 02:14:16.64
And he would always ask about El Hefe.

1658
02:14:16.64 --> 02:14:25.64
Yeah, El Hefe. And of course, I came in. I made sure my stars were on my name tag, wasn't on. But he knew who I was. I mean, just by, you know, you can end.

1659
02:14:25.64 --> 02:14:35.64
So 30 days into it, it was time to move him. And I was really hoping that by this time, you know, the uncertainty had really kind of blossomed. He didn't know that, of course.

1660
02:14:35.64 --> 02:14:40.64
And I thought, well, let's see if I can get him to tell the insurgents to stand down.

1661
02:14:40.64 --> 02:14:48.64
So we had a plan brought my translator in. And of course, I knew what his answers would be, but I figured I got nothing to lose here.

1662
02:14:48.64 --> 02:14:57.64
So I sat down with him and I said, look, you know, the kind of the wars over here. The Americans have come in and we've, and he just kind of nodded.

1663
02:14:57.64 --> 02:15:07.64
And I said, but your people are still dying. And you know, you can do one of two things. You can become Benito Mussolini and be the petty dictator or you can do right by your country.

1664
02:15:07.64 --> 02:15:15.64
It's not going to end well for you. You got to know that. But tell them to lay down there arm. So we're not killing any more rackets.

1665
02:15:15.64 --> 02:15:22.64
And I knew he'd asked me the question that I thought he would ask. He said, if it was you, would you do it?

1666
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:32.64
And I said, look, you know, if it was for the best part of my country, I do what it took to save my country. And he looks at me goes, I don't think so.

1667
02:15:32.64 --> 02:15:41.64
He in Arabic, but it was trying to diagnose me. And then I said to him, I said, okay, you're not going to see me again. We're moving you.

1668
02:15:41.64 --> 02:15:51.64
And he was like, because we've been taking pretty good care of him. And he was like, oh, this is not a good idea. And so then he starts to get a little talked about, I said, time's done.

1669
02:15:51.64 --> 02:15:58.64
And so that night, we undercover darkness removed him to some military police and they held onto him until the trial.

1670
02:15:58.64 --> 02:16:10.64
But watching his, again, watching him and his behavior and how it changed when he no longer felt he was in a position of power was, I think important to realize, you know, that's what you do.

1671
02:16:10.64 --> 02:16:23.64
You're booked back on bullies. You know, at the end of the day, you stand up to the bullies. And if all they had was the trappings around them, they're, they're not the kind of people that are going to be able to stand up to you for very long.

1672
02:16:23.64 --> 02:16:32.64
And you know, he was a function of the generals that supported in and all of the trappings. And when you took that away, he was just a bully.

1673
02:16:32.64 --> 02:16:49.64
A sadistic maniacal evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil. So you, you get to dumb. And did you think the war was going to be over at that point?

1674
02:16:49.64 --> 02:17:04.64
No, because by that point, we'd seen the insurgency begin to build. As you recall, you know, I got there in October of O3. It was interesting. When I got there, the guy I was relieving, it was an Air Force One Star. It was a deputy at J.S.

1675
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:20.64
I'm getting there thinking, hot bang, you know, I finally got to get in the war. And he says, hey, like, you know, some great restaurants in downtown Baghdad. You know, if you, you get to break, go down. There's this place to get some swarm. I'm like, I'm sorry. What?

1676
02:17:20.64 --> 02:17:37.64
I was, I said, men of the war is over. And we just got to get sedan, but I mean, everything's kind of over now. I was like, damn. And then a couple weeks later, route Irish blows up and as you know, route Irish never changed after that. Then we started getting guys ambushed.

1677
02:17:37.64 --> 02:17:51.64
And again, this was a, the transition period of the war. So my time we got sedan in December, the insurgency was kind of, you know, it was, it was moving pretty strong by then. So we knew that what I'm going to be over any time.

1678
02:17:51.64 --> 02:18:02.64
But so I was there too. At that time, the last op that I did, well, we did a couple more, but the last big op that I did was going after Yakube, which was,

1679
02:18:02.64 --> 02:18:09.64
the soldiers, one of the soldiers, lieutenant and that, that really made things bad really quickly.

1680
02:18:09.64 --> 02:18:18.64
So you, you're the, you're the deputy of J. Sock and how are you just doing like a part port and starboard in Iraq?

1681
02:18:18.64 --> 02:18:30.64
Yes, and Afghanistan. So, of course, at this point in time. So this is 2003 for me. You know, we had gone into Afghanistan, kicked the Taliban out, put cars,

1682
02:18:30.64 --> 02:18:44.64
and then Afghanistan was kind of for a long time there. It was the other theater that we didn't have much presence there. The only soft presence was a kind of a half a seal squadron at the time.

1683
02:18:44.64 --> 02:18:51.64
And, and probably some reserve green braise from from the 20th and 19th group.

1684
02:18:51.64 --> 02:19:02.64
Everybody else was in Iraq. And so we got to Iraq, but then in late 2003, General Absate says, hey, look, we need to pick up the pace in Afghanistan.

1685
02:19:02.64 --> 02:19:17.64
A little concerned about the Taliban resurgence, etc. So what we would do is, I would go kind of over to theater and, you know, four, five, six months sort of pump and, and I'd spend a couple months in Iraq and then I go to Afghanistan.

1686
02:19:17.64 --> 02:19:25.64
So I would bounce back and forth on the plane, you know, fly through all you did, stop there, and then go to Afghanistan.

1687
02:19:25.64 --> 02:19:30.64
It's been a couple of weeks there, kind of managing that, pop back to Iraq, and so it was kind of back and forth.

1688
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:38.64
And it was supposed to be generally three months on, three months off, rarely ended up being that when I was the deputy.

1689
02:19:38.64 --> 02:19:45.64
It'd be, you know, four, five months back for a couple months back out, and so we just kind of flip, pop back and forth.

1690
02:19:45.64 --> 02:19:54.64
And at some point in time, General Christle kind of came over and really began to focus on Iraq and then moved me to Afghanistan.

1691
02:19:54.64 --> 02:19:59.64
And so myself and the other deputy then kind of began to rotate more and more in Afghanistan.

1692
02:19:59.64 --> 02:20:02.64
But that took a while.

1693
02:20:02.64 --> 02:20:06.64
When did you take over as Commander, Jay Sock?

1694
02:20:06.64 --> 02:20:09.64
2008.

1695
02:20:09.64 --> 02:20:23.64
Did you spend, it started spending more time in Iraq? Oh yeah. So yeah, I remember at the time, we had developed the capability to really be able to kind of command and control remotely at that point.

1696
02:20:23.64 --> 02:20:31.64
We built up the, the Joc and in Fort Brag to be in a position where the ISR was good enough and you could have stayed as the commander, you could have stayed in Fort Brag.

1697
02:20:31.64 --> 02:20:36.64
You know, let the kernels and maybe the one stars kind of run things, but you know, the way that was going to happen.

1698
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:39.64
I mean, you got to be forward if you're going to command.

1699
02:20:39.64 --> 02:20:48.64
So yeah, I mean, a week or so after I took command, I went out to Iraq and then settled down there for six months, some months that I remember what it was.

1700
02:20:48.64 --> 02:20:54.64
And then, periodically, I bounced over to Afghanistan, just to kind of keep things moving over there.

1701
02:20:54.64 --> 02:21:05.64
And then in 2009, by this time, General Patricia taking over Suncom, and he said, hey, look, yeah, we really need to have you, the Jay Sock commander shift your flag to have

1702
02:21:05.64 --> 02:21:14.64
me to Afghanistan. So, so then I would say prior to that it was probably three quarters of my time in Iraq, a quarter in Afghanistan.

1703
02:21:14.64 --> 02:21:21.64
2009 comes, it just reversed. Then I, you know, three quarters of my time in Afghanistan about a quarter of my time in Iraq.

1704
02:21:21.64 --> 02:21:29.64
You got a, you got a section in C stories that I think I'm not going to say there's a typical mission, but I mean, there's a little bit of a typical mission.

1705
02:21:29.64 --> 02:21:33.64
It's what you mentioned already, you know, you do something over and over again, repetitively.

1706
02:21:33.64 --> 02:21:39.64
And I thought this was a, this one pretty pretty concise little, quote, typical mission.

1707
02:21:39.64 --> 02:21:45.64
Going to the book in a cloud of dust, the heelos lifted off from an airfield in western Iraq and within minutes were an

1708
02:21:45.64 --> 02:21:51.64
type formation screaming across the desert just 50 feet off the ground two minutes later, the next, the next call came across in the border.

1709
02:21:51.64 --> 02:21:56.64
A drone flying high overhead captured the scene is the four heelos,

1710
02:21:56.64 --> 02:22:05.64
heelos lifted a large berm separating Iraq from Syria. It was broad daylight and there was no hiding from view. If the Syrian air defense detected heelos, either visually or on radar,

1711
02:22:05.64 --> 02:22:14.64
they would immediately open fire with surface to air missiles or anti aircraft guns. The Syrians were our allies, but not our friends.

1712
02:22:14.64 --> 02:22:21.64
One minute to touch down from above the two blackhawk gunships took the lead and immediately began to separate one taking the north side of

1713
02:22:21.64 --> 02:22:29.64
Godee as compound the other the south they would provide gunfire support for the assaulters. The view from the drone shifted away from the approaching heelos

1714
02:22:29.64 --> 02:22:40.64
and onto the compound. In the large courtyard seven men hearing the noise of the inbound heelos began to run excitingly looking for cover grabbing their guns ready to fight.

1715
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:45.64
On screen Roger Votel responded watching as the heelos came into view,

1716
02:22:45.64 --> 02:22:53.64
barely missing the outside wall the lead heelos flared. It's nose arching upward tailroader down as it stopped in mid air and landed hard on the ground inside the courtyard.

1717
02:22:53.64 --> 02:23:01.64
Shots fired, shots fired, came the familiar refrain. The operators poured out of the first heelos and immediately were engaged by Godee and his men.

1718
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:09.64
The next heelos was seconds behind executing the same aerial maneuver landing just feet from the first aircraft. Outside the wall the last two heelos set down,

1719
02:23:09.64 --> 02:23:16.64
the soldiers rushing off the aircraft and taking up security positions to ensure that none of Godee is men escape the assault.

1720
02:23:16.64 --> 02:23:22.64
Shots fired, shots fired, the operators inside the courtyard spread out, sweeping forward toward Godee.

1721
02:23:22.64 --> 02:23:29.64
The rounds flying both ways. There was no way out. One by one Godee is men fell and within minutes the fight was over.

1722
02:23:29.64 --> 02:23:35.64
Cowering unarmed in the small tent in the middle of the compound were several young children and a woman.

1723
02:23:35.64 --> 02:23:40.64
The drone overhead watched as the operators went from dead man to dead man looking for their target.

1724
02:23:40.64 --> 02:23:47.64
Minutes later came the call, Jackpot. I say again, Jackpot. Roger Votel answered a smile coming across his face.

1725
02:23:47.64 --> 02:23:54.64
This mission had been a long time coming. On target the chaos was subsiding, the gun fired stopped, but the clock was ticking.

1726
02:23:54.64 --> 02:23:59.64
By now the Syrians were aware the Americans had crossed the border. It was time to go.

1727
02:23:59.64 --> 02:24:07.64
So picking up the body of Abu Godee, the assaulters exited the compound, boarded the heelos, and within three minutes were back in Iraq.

1728
02:24:07.64 --> 02:24:12.64
The total time of the mission, 17 minutes.

1729
02:24:12.64 --> 02:24:19.64
But you're right. Typical mission. As you well know, this was at one point in time.

1730
02:24:19.64 --> 02:24:28.64
I think we were doing between 20 and 25 missions a night in Iraq with the whole force, not one entity, but the entire force.

1731
02:24:28.64 --> 02:24:37.64
And they all followed pretty much the same sort of method of operation that you either went in by heavow, or you went in by ground, ground assault.

1732
02:24:37.64 --> 02:24:44.64
And of course the great thing about Iraq from a tactical standpoint, from a commander standpoint, is you're driving to the objective.

1733
02:24:44.64 --> 02:24:55.64
If you're in Baghdad or most of the old or pick up place, you drive 500 feet from the objective. The guys get out, you know, the guys put up blocking positions. The assault force comes in, breaks the door and way they go.

1734
02:24:55.64 --> 02:25:05.64
And yeah, I would go out with the guys periodically and we did four or five targets a night. Just not there. Nope, not there. Nope. And eventually you get the bad guy.

1735
02:25:05.64 --> 02:25:15.64
And then of course the heelos we use mainly for getting out into, you know, a little further out, but that particular mission.

1736
02:25:15.64 --> 02:25:27.64
But I'll look at you. It was probably one of the most notorious facilitators and we just could never get to him. And he was the guy that was bringing in all the fighters, foreign fighters from outside Iraq.

1737
02:25:27.64 --> 02:25:34.64
And he would funnel them in through across the border and into al Qaeda in Iraq, we called him at the time.

1738
02:25:34.64 --> 02:25:40.64
But he was elusive. And finally when we finally got an opportunity to get him.

1739
02:25:40.64 --> 02:25:50.64
And I was briefing President Bush on the video. And it was interesting to see, you know, it was great because the president was very decisive.

1740
02:25:50.64 --> 02:26:01.64
And I was fortunate. And of course, my time is both the commander in the deputy. I had both President Bush and President Obama. And I will offer as different as they may have been from a personality standpoint.

1741
02:26:01.64 --> 02:26:14.64
They were both very decisive when it came to giving you authority to go get the bad guys. And this one, you know, they remember President Bush coming around the table with the, you know, the Secretary of Defense Secretary of State.

1742
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:22.64
And I also thumbs up. And away we went. And again, from the, so I gave a vote tell you, you, your timeline, you go.

1743
02:26:22.64 --> 02:26:32.64
And he was in Iraq at the time. And the next thing I know, you know, 17 minutes, I mean, 17 minutes from the time they launched time across the border, get the objective and back.

1744
02:26:32.64 --> 02:26:37.64
That was. I remember when I, when I reported back the White House, they're like, I'm sorry, what?

1745
02:26:37.64 --> 02:26:41.64
It's done. It's done. That's really done.

1746
02:26:41.64 --> 02:26:44.64
That's building a good reputation for the trip.

1747
02:26:44.64 --> 02:26:45.64
Oh, the macro.

1748
02:26:45.64 --> 02:26:55.64
In the midst of all this stuff you got going on, you get, you could hit with the, the Mayor's Gallabama and Captain Phillips. And what's interesting, I remember I used to tell these young

1749
02:26:55.64 --> 02:27:00.64
Junior officers and platoon commanders and task unit commanders.

1750
02:27:00.64 --> 02:27:05.64
If you think these operations are going to show up on your door and like, okay, cool, the world is going to execute it.

1751
02:27:05.64 --> 02:27:18.64
Every one of them is is like a soap opera to try and get it together. And you have to kind of force these operations to happen. And, and so you've got all that going on. And then here comes this.

1752
02:27:18.64 --> 02:27:20.64
The Mayor's Gallabama.

1753
02:27:20.64 --> 02:27:30.64
And it's great. You got to read the book. There's all these different assets. You got people, guys moving from different theaters and guys from the States coming out.

1754
02:27:30.64 --> 02:27:43.64
The Mayor assets, you got Navy assets, ships and logistics for all those pieces. This is a massive operation. And again, I love your tone of voice when you read it in the audio book.

1755
02:27:43.64 --> 02:27:46.64
You keep, you keep saying, it's a lifeboat.

1756
02:27:46.64 --> 02:27:48.64
It's almost comical.

1757
02:27:48.64 --> 02:27:52.64
And I just went to the UDTC, New Zealand and Fort Pierce Florida, where they have the lifeboat.

1758
02:27:52.64 --> 02:27:53.64
They got it there.

1759
02:27:53.64 --> 02:27:54.64
I haven't seen it all yet.

1760
02:27:54.64 --> 02:27:55.64
Yeah, yeah.

1761
02:27:55.64 --> 02:28:03.64
Great. And of course, we got some connections there. So you're not allowed to walk inside, but we got to walk inside and check it out. You can see all the bullet holes are there and everything.

1762
02:28:03.64 --> 02:28:16.64
But what I noticed about that, a couple things. Number one, the authority and trust that you had with the guys in the ground, which is the mark of the leader that you want to work for.

1763
02:28:16.64 --> 02:28:23.64
The one that's not micromanaging, the one that trusts the guys on the ground. General Pat and said the, what do you say? The, the commander on the ground is always right.

1764
02:28:23.64 --> 02:28:26.64
And that seemed to be your attitude all the time.

1765
02:28:26.64 --> 02:28:31.64
The trust that you had with the guys on the ground.

1766
02:28:31.64 --> 02:28:36.64
And what was phenomenal.

1767
02:28:36.64 --> 02:28:48.64
Also as even when that all happened, I remember thinking of myself, man, if that happened in 1994, how much different, do you think it would have been a lot different?

1768
02:28:48.64 --> 02:28:52.64
Well, you know, the interesting thing about it, and you're characterized it correctly.

1769
02:28:52.64 --> 02:29:01.64
And, and the operators don't even understand this and, or do they need to know this, but I talked about my time working in the White House for two years in the White House.

1770
02:29:01.64 --> 02:29:11.64
So when I became a J. Sock commander, I was in a position to be able to understand how decisions were made in the White House and also in the Pentagon.

1771
02:29:11.64 --> 02:29:21.64
And I had a great relationship with the Secretary of Defense Bob Gates and Admiral Mike Mullin, who was a chairman and of course, we've done a number of things for the White House at that point in time.

1772
02:29:21.64 --> 02:29:31.64
One of the things I used to always do, and I think it infuriated some folks in the White House in the Pentagon, was, I would always say, let me pre-position the guys.

1773
02:29:31.64 --> 02:29:41.64
You don't have to make the decision, you don't have to give me the authority to do the assault, but what I don't want to do is for you to give me the authority and then not be in the window to do it.

1774
02:29:41.64 --> 02:29:46.64
So let me go and put the guys off the coast of Somalia for whatever we were going to do.

1775
02:29:46.64 --> 02:29:53.64
I decided to go go. And finally, of course, somebody said, you do this every time.

1776
02:29:53.64 --> 02:30:01.64
And you know that there is this kind of predisposition that if the guys are already out there, why not just let them do it?

1777
02:30:01.64 --> 02:30:04.64
I was like, really? I didn't know that.

1778
02:30:04.64 --> 02:30:12.64
But that was always a little bit of the game if you were all I played in terms of making sure that I wanted the guys always to be in a position.

1779
02:30:12.64 --> 02:30:22.64
That if we got the approval to go, that they weren't, we weren't now having to move and then miss the opportunity because I'd seen it happen before, where we waited and waited.

1780
02:30:22.64 --> 02:30:27.64
The decision was hard and finally people would say, okay, we're going to give you permission to go and you go, I'm sorry man.

1781
02:30:27.64 --> 02:30:29.64
It's going to take me three days to get there.

1782
02:30:29.64 --> 02:30:30.64
It's going to take me three days to get there.

1783
02:30:30.64 --> 02:30:36.64
And that's what they didn't understand a lot. It's three days by the time, not just the guys from the States, but you got to move ships down.

1784
02:30:36.64 --> 02:30:38.64
It ships don't move very fast.

1785
02:30:38.64 --> 02:30:48.64
So 99% of the time, I think the White House and the putting out was happy that I pushed them to be in a position, but not always.

1786
02:30:48.64 --> 02:30:56.64
But in the case with the Maris Gallaudet, I mean, I get to call from the joint staff that this light boat's been taken.

1787
02:30:56.64 --> 02:31:01.64
We got a captain in there and you made it called to do this mission.

1788
02:31:01.64 --> 02:31:04.64
Of course, I kept thinking, it's a light boat.

1789
02:31:04.64 --> 02:31:13.64
But very quickly, I mean, it happened to be over Easter and it's not that things changed much over Easter, you know.

1790
02:31:13.64 --> 02:31:16.64
But I just remember it happened to be that weekend.

1791
02:31:16.64 --> 02:31:18.64
But you know, immediately, I know what to do.

1792
02:31:18.64 --> 02:31:24.64
I'm going to get on the video with Ebromullin and I'm going to get on the video with the White House and we're going to begin to lay out a plan.

1793
02:31:24.64 --> 02:31:30.64
And I'm going to make sure that the guys on the west coast are ready to move, because we got to get boats.

1794
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:44.64
And I'm going to get the fleet moving, interestingly enough for this. My one time that I was proud I was a fleet commander for a couple of days because General Patreyes chopped the change of operational control chopped the fleet assets to me.

1795
02:31:44.64 --> 02:31:46.64
Even though I was actually in Afghanistan.

1796
02:31:46.64 --> 02:31:59.64
And of course, what people I think have trouble understanding is my situational awareness by the time this is going to my situational awareness in Afghanistan was almost as good in terms of the bigger picture of the guys were on the ground.

1797
02:31:59.64 --> 02:32:04.64
I'm looking at it from the close circuit TV that's on board the ship.

1798
02:32:04.64 --> 02:32:08.64
We've got a drone overhead. We've got a lot of these assets so you can kind of see what's happening.

1799
02:32:08.64 --> 02:32:15.64
Of course, at the end of the day Captain Scott Moore, who was the commander of the seal unit there, he's the guy that's running the show on the ground.

1800
02:32:15.64 --> 02:32:18.64
But Scott and I are talking a couple of times a day.

1801
02:32:18.64 --> 02:32:25.64
But yeah, you can't be in a position as the three star to be telling, okay, like I want the snipers in these positions.

1802
02:32:25.64 --> 02:32:30.64
I don't want the snipers to do that. No, you got to rely on the guys that have been doing this again for years at this point in time.

1803
02:32:30.64 --> 02:32:33.64
You know they're going to make the best decision possible.

1804
02:32:33.64 --> 02:32:43.64
I was one of the things that always gave me comfort as a commander was I knew the guys would make as good a decision as I would make.

1805
02:32:43.64 --> 02:32:46.64
I needed to put them in a position to be successful.

1806
02:32:46.64 --> 02:32:51.64
My job was to get them to the point where now they could take action if they needed to.

1807
02:32:51.64 --> 02:32:58.64
And then let them figure out how to take the best action whether that was been lottery whether that was the mayor's gallevamo whether it was a thousand other missions.

1808
02:32:58.64 --> 02:33:04.64
Hey, you're the commander. I'm not going on the op. I'm not going to be the guy that's in the line of march. I'm not going to be breaching the door.

1809
02:33:04.64 --> 02:33:07.64
I want to put you in a position to be successful. I want to make sure you get the right ISR.

1810
02:33:07.64 --> 02:33:12.64
I want to make sure you got the right, you know, cap overhead. I want to make sure you got the right artillery. I want to make sure you got the right meta-vac.

1811
02:33:12.64 --> 02:33:16.64
I want to make sure we're monitoring a way that's going to make you successful in the end of the day.

1812
02:33:16.64 --> 02:33:21.64
Hey, young sergeant, young petty officer, young captain, young lieutenant, whoever you happen to be.

1813
02:33:21.64 --> 02:33:25.64
You take the tackle into this and you'll do just fine.

1814
02:33:25.64 --> 02:33:28.64
Yeah, you'll screw it up every once in a while. Guess what we all do.

1815
02:33:28.64 --> 02:33:34.64
And when that does, we'll take a hard look at why we made the mistake and we'll make the corrections.

1816
02:33:34.64 --> 02:33:39.64
And if somebody screwed it up because they really did something bad, we're going to hold you accountable.

1817
02:33:39.64 --> 02:33:42.64
But other than that, get out and do the very best you can.

1818
02:33:42.64 --> 02:33:46.64
We weren't always successful. We had some some ops that went south on us.

1819
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:56.64
But I wouldn't change anything about the way we had set up the organization to empower the guys, you know, at that level to make the decisions and take the actions.

1820
02:33:56.64 --> 02:34:08.64
Yeah, I call that the iterative decision making process. I was one thing that I, as I was in charge of things and some kind of an operation would come up.

1821
02:34:08.64 --> 02:34:14.64
Or even if it was like a totally tactical thing of what should we do right now. I would always make really small decisions really quickly.

1822
02:34:14.64 --> 02:34:22.64
Yeah. And it made people think I was very decisive because I would make decisions very quickly. They wouldn't recognize how small decisions I've made.

1823
02:34:22.64 --> 02:34:25.64
And then I would just adapt and adjust them as needed as we move forward.

1824
02:34:25.64 --> 02:34:34.64
But I like the fact that you use the iterative decision making process, taking small steps to actually put some to make it easier for the boss to make a final decision.

1825
02:34:34.64 --> 02:34:38.64
Because we're already just all you need to do is pull the trigger the weapons there, the site is on.

1826
02:34:38.64 --> 02:34:42.64
We're ready to do this. Just say go and we'll go.

1827
02:34:42.64 --> 02:34:49.64
Similar similar one with Salah, Alis, Salah, Nabon, my saying that right?

1828
02:34:49.64 --> 02:34:51.64
Salah Nabon, right? Salah Nabon, right?

1829
02:34:51.64 --> 02:34:58.64
So you talk about, you know, again, these, there's relationships. And here you had van Housher on the ground.

1830
02:34:58.64 --> 02:35:06.64
Who's, who's like the epic seal officer, right? He was a, he was in Vietnam as a Marine.

1831
02:35:06.64 --> 02:35:12.64
And, you know, lost his leg due to a parachute accident and it's just a badass.

1832
02:35:12.64 --> 02:35:19.64
Nothing stops, but you know, and here you are, you have, so you've got him below you in the chain of command.

1833
02:35:19.64 --> 02:35:26.64
When you've got this awesome trust. And then up the chain of command, you've got Mollon and the chairman of the, I mean, Mollon, the admiral Mollon, the chairman of the children,

1834
02:35:26.64 --> 02:35:34.64
the chairman of the children, the chief of staff and key trust you. So this is how you, you run this thing is do these relationships.

1835
02:35:34.64 --> 02:35:37.64
Yeah, and it went, fortunately, by that time, by the time we went to Salah Nabon.

1836
02:35:37.64 --> 02:35:43.64
So Salah Nabon was a guy in Somalia, but he had been responsible for two embassy bombings.

1837
02:35:43.64 --> 02:35:48.64
And he was at one point in time. He was like the number one guy in the FBI's top 10 list.

1838
02:35:48.64 --> 02:35:52.64
And then after 9, 11 happens, he kind of falls a little lower down the list.

1839
02:35:52.64 --> 02:35:57.64
But nobody could find him. And again, a very loose of guy, hiding in Somalia.

1840
02:35:57.64 --> 02:36:00.64
And then again, our focus had shifted to Iraq and Afghanistan.

1841
02:36:00.64 --> 02:36:07.64
We'll also get this lead on, on Nabon. And, but we didn't know whether or not it was him for certain.

1842
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:11.64
Again, we had an OGA source who said, hey, we think this is him.

1843
02:36:11.64 --> 02:36:16.64
And if it is him, he's going to be in a blue sedan. He's going to move up and down the beach.

1844
02:36:16.64 --> 02:36:22.64
So back to that process again, it was okay. I'm going to put the guys in a position.

1845
02:36:22.64 --> 02:36:27.64
So we moved a couple of small boys, couple of the stores out there, put some little bird helicopters on him,

1846
02:36:27.64 --> 02:36:36.64
and set the conditions so that if, in fact, we had a bead on Nabon, then we were in a position to react.

1847
02:36:36.64 --> 02:36:41.64
And, and to your point about Pete Van Hoosier. So again, interestingly enough, you talked about the distributed command.

1848
02:36:41.64 --> 02:36:48.64
So I'm in Afghanistan. Pete is back in the States. We are both looking at the same feed.

1849
02:36:48.64 --> 02:36:58.64
So we had a predator overhead of ISR platform. And now, I had briefed this because there had been a lot of concern in the White House

1850
02:36:58.64 --> 02:37:03.64
that they didn't want to put, he loads anywhere in Somalia because of the Black Hawk down incident.

1851
02:37:03.64 --> 02:37:08.64
And no matter how much I tried to convince him that really it would be okay, we know how to do this.

1852
02:37:08.64 --> 02:37:13.64
We've been doing this a lot. There were still a lot of sensitivity to that. And I understood that.

1853
02:37:13.64 --> 02:37:22.64
But we had developed this kind of special bomb at the time that we could drop from a smaller plane, but it was experimental to say the least.

1854
02:37:22.64 --> 02:37:28.64
And so I had been given approval to, okay, you can bring the helos in, but only to confirm that you've killed the bad guy,

1855
02:37:28.64 --> 02:37:35.64
don't want the helos in until the bomb has been dropped and you've gotten the bad guy and then bring the helos in, get the remains ring back.

1856
02:37:35.64 --> 02:37:40.64
Yes, sir, I got it. Well, you know, not always that simple.

1857
02:37:40.64 --> 02:37:47.64
So as the sedan starts to move and we believe that to be saw in Abhan, we've got, I mean, so long road,

1858
02:37:47.64 --> 02:37:55.64
but there's only a small window of opportunity where that vehicle is not going to be in a crowded area, not a little village or something,

1859
02:37:55.64 --> 02:38:01.64
because we did not actually want to hit any civilians. So the plane gets overhead, we're in the window,

1860
02:38:01.64 --> 02:38:07.64
but the plane can't get a bead on the weather comes in, nothing's looking right, we can't get the targeting right.

1861
02:38:07.64 --> 02:38:16.64
And now I'm losing my target. So Pete Van Hurses on the other end going, sir, come on, you know, we're, we need to send the helos in.

1862
02:38:16.64 --> 02:38:22.64
And I'm like, you know, I was really told kind of not to do that.

1863
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:28.64
But now my target is getting away and you know, you're rolled the dice and hope that this is the bad guy that you thought it was.

1864
02:38:28.64 --> 02:38:33.64
And so finally I said, okay, Pete, you got it. And you know, the helos went in.

1865
02:38:33.64 --> 02:38:37.64
And of course, as soon as the bad guy saw the helos, they opened up on us.

1866
02:38:37.64 --> 02:38:41.64
Helos opened up on them. That obviously doesn't go through well form.

1867
02:38:41.64 --> 02:38:44.64
There's little bird gun ships, which you're familiar with.

1868
02:38:44.64 --> 02:38:48.64
Seals get off. The helos do a quick court on.

1869
02:38:48.64 --> 02:38:56.64
I mean, this was right before they were getting to a little village, pull the bodies out and all four of them turned out to be bad guys and selling Abhan was one of them.

1870
02:38:56.64 --> 02:39:02.64
And I remember the next day, or maybe the later that day, Abhan will mull and comes on the video.

1871
02:39:02.64 --> 02:39:12.64
And yeah, it's very gracious, it goes, well, you know, the open regulations, please pass on my congratulations to Captain Van Hoosier and the guys really good job.

1872
02:39:12.64 --> 02:39:15.64
So thanks, sir, and he goes, no William.

1873
02:39:15.64 --> 02:39:17.64
And I knew I was in trouble when he called me William.

1874
02:39:17.64 --> 02:39:24.64
He says, no William, I recall you briefing the president of the United States.

1875
02:39:24.64 --> 02:39:30.64
But you were going to drop a bomb on this guy and there weren't, you know, he loads were going to come in.

1876
02:39:30.64 --> 02:39:34.64
Is sir, well, you know, everyone's in a while.

1877
02:39:34.64 --> 02:39:43.64
You've got to give the commander a little discretion and the animal kind of smiled and again he said, okay, William, let's get away with this dive.

1878
02:39:43.64 --> 02:39:49.64
And all's well, it ends well sort of thing, but the president ever questioned it.

1879
02:39:49.64 --> 02:39:52.64
And I think Abhan mulled appreciate the commander's decision.

1880
02:39:52.64 --> 02:39:59.64
Yeah, and those, the amount of leadership capital, I mean, sure that one might have cost you a little bit of leadership capital, but the amount of leadership got me.

1881
02:39:59.64 --> 02:40:04.64
We just talked about the other off that we took discussed there with Abu Goudilla, you know, 17 minutes.

1882
02:40:04.64 --> 02:40:19.64
And how many, as you said, thousands of operations were conducted that, you know, look, we all know some of them go bad inside ways and that's awful, but the, I mean, the batting average of success was overwhelmingly,

1883
02:40:19.64 --> 02:40:47.64
but it's actually incredible when you think about it. And so this, this, this, this optempo and this kind of being successful on a regular basis and building that leadership capital and, and kind of, I mean, I guess you, in my opinion, or the way it looks, the final operation that you, you cover in sea stories is, is the first one that I started off with, but which is like I said is I guess it's.

1884
02:40:47.64 --> 02:40:56.64
And ten years. Yeah, it's been ten years and, and I mean, if that's not the most famous US special operations mission, I'm not sure what is, but it's Neptune spear.

1885
02:40:56.64 --> 02:41:00.64
The Ray that killed bin Laden and.

1886
02:41:00.64 --> 02:41:05.64
I mean, you, you, you got to, you know, the perspective that you give.

1887
02:41:05.64 --> 02:41:16.64
The intelligence gathered, the preparation, the secrecy, I mean, you got one part where you're talking about, I forget who it is, you're talking about, maybe it's your ex-O or your deputy.

1888
02:41:16.64 --> 02:41:25.64
Or maybe you're ops officer, but you, you're not even telling your ops officer. It's complete secrecy about what's going on. The professionalism in every department.

1889
02:41:25.64 --> 02:41:38.64
You go through and kind of talk about the decision making process and the discussion to get to these decision points and the conversations and the relationships between you and Admiral Mollon and Secretary Gates and the CIA officials.

1890
02:41:38.64 --> 02:41:48.64
And then the president, who's who has to understand and be comfortable with this and the, I mean, this is a tough, this is a freaking hard choice to make.

1891
02:41:48.64 --> 02:42:07.64
You know, massive amount of risk and some other much lower risk in terms of US troops and, you know, like to say, oh, yeah, yeah, of all these options. We're going to take the one that puts the US troops in the biggest risk.

1892
02:42:07.64 --> 02:42:13.64
Just doing incredible job of of spelling that out in the book.

1893
02:42:13.64 --> 02:42:20.64
The pilots, their skills, and then, of course, you know, you got the seals on the ground, the best guys in the world, the best, the best.

1894
02:42:20.64 --> 02:42:25.64
What a, what an incredible story.

1895
02:42:25.64 --> 02:42:31.64
Well, but there were so many people that had to, you know, make this happen.

1896
02:42:31.64 --> 02:42:42.64
And to your point, you know, great trust from, you know, the president on down. But I look back and I'm always great to point out about this and you can certainly appreciate this.

1897
02:42:42.64 --> 02:42:55.64
You know, we were, we were honored to be the guys that got been ladden and, and I think what the reason we were honored is because we were representing, you know, the hundreds of thousands of soldiers,

1898
02:42:55.64 --> 02:43:04.64
the soldiers, the Arab and the Marines, you know, and thousands that were killed in combat and training for combat that had died as a result of 9.11.

1899
02:43:04.64 --> 02:43:18.64
So, yeah, this was, I mean, this was the brass ring for us, but it was also an opportunity to represent everybody that had sacrificed so much from Iraq and Afghanistan.

1900
02:43:18.64 --> 02:43:27.64
But on this particular mission, you know, back to my earlier discussion, my job, I knew my job was to put the operators in a position where they were going to be successful.

1901
02:43:27.64 --> 02:43:36.64
Unfortunately, on, because we referred to it as the Biggest List, which is a World War II term that says, you know, those people that are authorized to know the intelligence.

1902
02:43:36.64 --> 02:43:41.64
So when I was brought into this in late January, it was me.

1903
02:43:41.64 --> 02:43:53.64
And of course, the White House is looking for a plan, and now, fortunately, you know, I had been in the teams at 34 years or something at that point in time, and thousands and thousands of missions.

1904
02:43:53.64 --> 02:44:02.64
And frankly, I did go back to my, my thesis at the Postgraduate School, I figured, okay, I'll present a shell of a plan to the present.

1905
02:44:02.64 --> 02:44:06.64
And, and then we'll take it from there, but the plan was going to be pretty simply.

1906
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:14.64
And you did on a helicopter, we're going to go from point A to point B, we're going to get the bad guy putting back on a helicopter and come home. That's it. I had looked at a lot of other alternatives, you know, could we parachute in.

1907
02:44:14.64 --> 02:44:19.64
Could we come in by vehicle, could we, you know, it was there other ways to get to the target.

1908
02:44:19.64 --> 02:44:26.64
But every time I looked at that, I kind of came back to my thesis, which was this idea, the point of vulnerability and put point in time.

1909
02:44:26.64 --> 02:44:35.64
Where, where you get tripped up. So if we parachute in, you're walking to an LZ and the next thing, you know, there's kids on the LZ, and now you're still 15, 16 kilometers from the target, you're saying, going to make it.

1910
02:44:35.64 --> 02:44:41.64
Same thing on, if we come in by vehicles, what happens if, you know, we'd stop to the checkpoint, everything gets busted.

1911
02:44:41.64 --> 02:44:46.64
So I decided early on that it was just going to be, you know, he loads from point A to point B.

1912
02:44:46.64 --> 02:44:54.64
And that's what I breathed present on. And early on it was just me and I had another captain who was in DC that was kind of covering for me.

1913
02:44:54.64 --> 02:45:00.64
But to your point, I couldn't tell anybody, I couldn't tell my command sergeant Major, I couldn't tell my ex. So I mean, it was, that was it.

1914
02:45:00.64 --> 02:45:07.64
So my executive officer, that in Colonel Art Sellers, who was just magnificent throughout this, I always say he's kind of the unsung hero.

1915
02:45:07.64 --> 02:45:17.64
Early on, I had to tell Art because in my world, I'm a three-star Admiral. And your executive officer is the guy that, I mean, he's kind of like an aide to camp, but more so.

1916
02:45:17.64 --> 02:45:23.64
He's a guy that makes sure that every paperwork, peace paperwork comes in, that you've got to take care of you take care of anything's happened that's happening.

1917
02:45:23.64 --> 02:45:28.64
The exo is orchestrating all this. And he becomes your kind of closest buddy along with your aide to camp.

1918
02:45:28.64 --> 02:45:36.64
So I told Art early on, I said, Art, something's brewing. I don't want you to ask any questions about it. You just need to do what I tell you.

1919
02:45:36.64 --> 02:45:44.64
And you know, and we'll be fine. It's like former Ranger. So I got it. And Art kind of helped me through all this.

1920
02:45:44.64 --> 02:45:49.64
We'd move from point A to point B and the staff would call up and go, where's the Admiral going?

1921
02:45:49.64 --> 02:45:57.64
I would say, you just hear him there. You will worry about where he's going. Now the interesting thing was I had been diagnosed with cancer in 2010.

1922
02:45:57.64 --> 02:46:05.64
And so with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. So the staff was always a little reluctant to ask me where I was going.

1923
02:46:05.64 --> 02:46:11.64
And when I kept going back and forth to Washington, D.C., they assumed I was going to Bethesda or Walter Reed for treatment.

1924
02:46:11.64 --> 02:46:19.64
I didn't, again, I didn't want necessarily play on my cancer diagnosis, but I also didn't want to disabuse him that idea because it gave me a little bit of cover for action.

1925
02:46:19.64 --> 02:46:24.64
I could move and the staff would just say he's in Washington. And people would say, what's he doing?

1926
02:46:24.64 --> 02:46:31.64
And they would kind of go, we don't know. But they felt comfortable thinking it was kind of part of my cancer treatment.

1927
02:46:31.64 --> 02:46:37.64
Finally, you know, the president at one point in time said, well, okay, you're breathing on this. Can we do it?

1928
02:46:37.64 --> 02:46:47.64
So it's right. I don't know. Then I got to bring in air planners. I got to bring in the seals. I got to bring in more people before I can really tell you whether or not we can do this.

1929
02:46:47.64 --> 02:46:56.64
So the president gave me about three weeks and that's when I brought the guys in to that undisclosed location in North Carolina where you read the excerpt at the beginning.

1930
02:46:56.64 --> 02:47:01.64
And it was pretty funny because as you can appreciate, you know, these guys have just come back from an deployment.

1931
02:47:01.64 --> 02:47:05.64
I'm often asked, you know, why did you pick the seals over the Delta Force guys?

1932
02:47:05.64 --> 02:47:09.64
And they think it was because I was a seal. And it was like, are you kidding me?

1933
02:47:09.64 --> 02:47:16.64
You think I would risk this mission based on, you know, some parochial nature of who I thought was going to be wearing a triednernaut.

1934
02:47:16.64 --> 02:47:26.64
So there were two commanders I trusted implicitly on the army side and the Navy side. Unfortunately, for the army guys, they had literally just deployed to Afghanistan.

1935
02:47:26.64 --> 02:47:32.64
And the seal squadron had just come back. So they were all in leave.

1936
02:47:32.64 --> 02:47:39.64
So that provided my kind of cover for action because the team just assumed they were out skiing in Tahoe or doing something.

1937
02:47:39.64 --> 02:47:48.64
So I called the squadron commander and I said, okay, and of course beat Van Hoosier, the CO. And we moved them all down to the Sun Disclosed location.

1938
02:47:48.64 --> 02:47:51.64
And as you know, we did these kind of sensitive training exercises ever once in a while.

1939
02:47:51.64 --> 02:48:00.64
And you can see when I walked into the room, they were like, you know, SOB. You called me off leave with my girlfriend to be, you know, kind of showcase something to the brass.

1940
02:48:00.64 --> 02:48:07.64
I fit all the time when the CIA guys said, and we're going after Ben Laden. It was like, as you read, it was like, I did series.

1941
02:48:07.64 --> 02:48:20.64
And I actually guys like in each other like, series. And of course after that, it all kind of unfolded. But again, my job was really to not to push it. One of the things I was careful about doing, because as we meet with the president, we have a number of options.

1942
02:48:20.64 --> 02:48:26.64
We had a kind of a massive bombing option. Can we take out this thing we called AC one, the Autobot compound one.

1943
02:48:26.64 --> 02:48:31.64
There's a big compound. You've probably seen pictures of a kind of trapezoid shape three store building, a couple of other outer buildings.

1944
02:48:31.64 --> 02:48:39.64
But that was going to take a massive amount of ordinance to level the place. Did I hear something like 30? Yeah, I hear more than that was 50.

1945
02:48:39.64 --> 02:48:50.64
A 2000 pound bombs in order to level the place. And of course, the the CDE, the collateral damage assessment was going to actually hit some of the outer line houses.

1946
02:48:50.64 --> 02:48:56.64
And we knew the women and children on the target. So I knew from the get go the president was one. We didn't know it's been lot.

1947
02:48:56.64 --> 02:49:07.64
So the president was not going to kill innocent women and children at all. Then we had a second option, which was a more surgical bombing option to get the pay.

1948
02:49:07.64 --> 02:49:12.64
As you pointed out, the guy who would come out every day around noon and walk around the compound.

1949
02:49:12.64 --> 02:49:20.64
Once again, even with the surgical bombing option, we were probably going to kill a couple of kids and I think the president just I know he that was just not what do you want to do.

1950
02:49:20.64 --> 02:49:23.64
And by the way, we weren't going to be sure if we did either one of those bombing options.

1951
02:49:23.64 --> 02:49:30.64
How would we know whether it was been lot? The al Qaeda crew to said, wasn't him unless we had visual evidence it was.

1952
02:49:30.64 --> 02:49:35.64
And of course, we weren't going to rely on the pack standies because we didn't know whether they had been compromised.

1953
02:49:35.64 --> 02:49:46.64
So it didn't take long. I think for the the group, the president's small team to begin to focus in on the raid and and our will mull them was always supportive other aid.

1954
02:49:46.64 --> 02:49:54.64
And and Leon Penetta, who was directed to the CIA, was always supportive. Interestingly enough, and I told the story before Secretary Gates did not support the raid.

1955
02:49:54.64 --> 02:50:00.64
And he didn't support the raid because he had been in the White House during a desert one when the helicopter crashed.

1956
02:50:00.64 --> 02:50:06.64
And at one point time after one of the meetings for the president, every time the president at the end of the meeting would kind of go around the room.

1957
02:50:06.64 --> 02:50:12.64
Okay, where are we now and they would say, well, I'm for it. I'm against it and he returned to Secretary Gates and say,

1958
02:50:12.64 --> 02:50:20.64
let's present, I don't support the raid. And so after the briefing was over, I came up with Secretary, I said, sir, I worked for you.

1959
02:50:20.64 --> 02:50:26.64
If you don't support the raid, you don't want me to do this, just say the word. I mean, you know, this is your call.

1960
02:50:26.64 --> 02:50:36.64
And he said something I thought was just, you know, again, fabulous leadership. He said, Bill said, I don't agree with the raid, but we've got to give the president every option available.

1961
02:50:36.64 --> 02:50:42.64
And if the raid is an option that I want him to, I want you to do the best you can to plan for it, prepare for it and give him that option.

1962
02:50:42.64 --> 02:50:48.64
At the end of the day, the president will make the decision. But just because I don't support it, doesn't mean we're not going to put that option in front of the president.

1963
02:50:48.64 --> 02:50:54.64
And again, I thought that was very classy of him and the kind of leader that you would hope to have in that chain of command.

1964
02:50:54.64 --> 02:51:03.64
But I remember the second last meeting we had, the president, again, because we were struggling with the term, any weather was been ladden.

1965
02:51:03.64 --> 02:51:09.64
He turned a mic lighter who was the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, which had been stood up after 9.11.

1966
02:51:09.64 --> 02:51:15.64
And he asked, lighten to kind of read team CIA's intelligence to kind of check their homework.

1967
02:51:15.64 --> 02:51:21.64
So the next meeting we were at, which was a couple weeks later, meaning starts in the April.

1968
02:51:21.64 --> 02:51:25.64
Me starts off in the president's turn to the latter and he says, well, what is fine?

1969
02:51:25.64 --> 02:51:31.64
I could tell lighters were a little uncomfortable. He goes, well, Mr. President, we've reviewed CIA's intelligence.

1970
02:51:31.64 --> 02:51:37.64
And we think the chance it has been ladden is anywhere between 60% and 40%.

1971
02:51:37.64 --> 02:51:41.64
And when he said 40% I'm thinking, well, I mean this mission's over.

1972
02:51:41.64 --> 02:51:49.64
Who in the hell is going to authorize a bunch of seals to fly 162 miles into Pakistan to a compound that is about three miles from their west point.

1973
02:51:49.64 --> 02:51:55.64
Three miles from a major infantry battalion, you know, a mile from a police station, and by the way, the Pakistanis have nuclear weapons.

1974
02:51:55.64 --> 02:51:59.64
I mean, who would authorize that on a 40% chance that has been ladden?

1975
02:51:59.64 --> 02:52:05.64
So I told the president, I said, sir, I, I got to head to Afghanistan. I'm going to command it from there.

1976
02:52:05.64 --> 02:52:11.64
If you decide to go, great. I'll have the boys ready to go. If you decide not to go, not a problem.

1977
02:52:11.64 --> 02:52:15.64
I got bad guys in Afghanistan, we'll just kind of get back to work. So that was on Wednesday.

1978
02:52:15.64 --> 02:52:19.64
I fly out to Afghanistan, got there sometime on Friday.

1979
02:52:19.64 --> 02:52:25.64
And I did a call from Leampon out of the director CIA and he says, President's made the decision to go.

1980
02:52:25.64 --> 02:52:31.64
That is a gutsy decision. I mean, in light of the fact that we just didn't know it was been ladden.

1981
02:52:31.64 --> 02:52:37.64
But this is back to the kind of discussion we've been having all throughout this podcast.

1982
02:52:37.64 --> 02:52:43.64
Is the president had seen, I think, over the time that, you know, we've been conducting missions,

1983
02:52:43.64 --> 02:52:54.64
that we were mostly successful. He had faith in confidence in us in a way that, you know, every commander would hope that their bosses had confidence in him.

1984
02:52:54.64 --> 02:52:57.64
And we hadn't got him all right. I mean, again, when I was a second man,

1985
02:52:57.64 --> 02:53:01.64
I read a couple of notable disasters, frankly.

1986
02:53:01.64 --> 02:53:11.64
And even at that, the president recognized that, you know, the failures we had were understandable and light of some of the circumstances around it.

1987
02:53:11.64 --> 02:53:13.64
And things don't always go perfect.

1988
02:53:13.64 --> 02:53:15.64
But he had confidence that we could do this.

1989
02:53:15.64 --> 02:53:23.64
And so next day, Saturday, the president calls me and says, he called it really, tell the guys, you know, good luck.

1990
02:53:23.64 --> 02:53:31.64
And it was interesting because, you know, man to man, you can tell, you know, even though he's the president of the states, he had this empathy.

1991
02:53:31.64 --> 02:53:37.64
You could tell he understood these guys are about to get on this helicopter and fly into Pakistan.

1992
02:53:37.64 --> 02:53:42.64
Didn't know whether they would come back because of course we didn't know whether or not was the compound rigged,

1993
02:53:42.64 --> 02:53:47.64
because as you saw in a rack quite a few times, you know, these guys would rig the entire compounds.

1994
02:53:47.64 --> 02:53:53.64
And so, the president of the state was, uh, been laughing going to be wearing a suicide vest, you know, what were they going to be facing?

1995
02:53:53.64 --> 02:53:57.64
And so as the president of the state's, he understood those risks.

1996
02:53:57.64 --> 02:54:05.64
And, and I could tell, you know, when he asked me to pass on, you know, his best to the guys, I mean, he seriously meant that he understood the risk they were taken in.

1997
02:54:05.64 --> 02:54:07.64
Yeah, as a commander, that means a lot to you.

1998
02:54:07.64 --> 02:54:09.64
And I did take the opportunity to pass it on.

1999
02:54:09.64 --> 02:54:12.64
But then I remember he said, well, Bill, what do you think?

2000
02:54:12.64 --> 02:54:14.64
I said, I'm a president.

2001
02:54:14.64 --> 02:54:18.64
I said, well, what's there? We're getting, if not, we'll come home.

2002
02:54:18.64 --> 02:54:22.64
The problem with the, if not, will come home scenario, which I had breathed press on.

2003
02:54:22.64 --> 02:54:28.64
I said, look, if the seals get on target and somebody comes out with a gun, it is not going to go too well for them.

2004
02:54:28.64 --> 02:54:32.64
And as they begin to sweep through the target, which they will, and more people come out with guns, and, you know,

2005
02:54:32.64 --> 02:54:36.64
or I can have Afghanistan and Pakistan people have guns, it's not going to go away.

2006
02:54:36.64 --> 02:54:40.64
And as they go from the first floor to the second floor to the third floor, look for Ben Laden.

2007
02:54:40.64 --> 02:54:44.64
And the guy we thought was Ben Laden turns out to be nothing but a tall pack of standing.

2008
02:54:44.64 --> 02:54:48.64
This is going to be a disaster of epic proportions.

2009
02:54:48.64 --> 02:54:54.64
I didn't tell the president that, but he understood that because we had talked about the fact that I told them early on.

2010
02:54:54.64 --> 02:54:58.64
I told everybody there, if the seals get on target, somebody's going to die.

2011
02:54:58.64 --> 02:55:00.64
You just need to understand that right now.

2012
02:55:00.64 --> 02:55:02.64
Nobody is going to walk away from this unsteady.

2013
02:55:02.64 --> 02:55:06.64
So understand those risks to the president and the other team.

2014
02:55:06.64 --> 02:55:08.64
So I understood that.

2015
02:55:08.64 --> 02:55:14.64
And again, back to the fact that he had faith in confidence on us.

2016
02:55:14.64 --> 02:55:16.64
We kept it secret, we kept it simple.

2017
02:55:16.64 --> 02:55:22.64
And then of course, the day of the operations, the guy is executed it exactly as you would hope they would.

2018
02:55:22.64 --> 02:55:28.64
You got a story in, I think it's in the hero code.

2019
02:55:28.64 --> 02:55:30.64
No, actually it's in sea stories.

2020
02:55:30.64 --> 02:55:34.64
It's the story about where you get in trouble, you get kind of caught by your dad.

2021
02:55:34.64 --> 02:55:36.64
Well, not caught by your dad, but you get caught.

2022
02:55:36.64 --> 02:55:40.64
You, you, you, you, you try to infiltrate a military.

2023
02:55:40.64 --> 02:55:41.64
What was it of?

2024
02:55:41.64 --> 02:55:46.64
And more, and more stories, and you, you, you, you know, you think your James Bond or whoever.

2025
02:55:46.64 --> 02:55:51.64
And you infiltrate, you got a cap gun on your, on your, you know, six-year-old cap gun with you.

2026
02:55:51.64 --> 02:55:56.64
And you, you infiltrate a freaking military compound with your buddy.

2027
02:55:56.64 --> 02:56:01.64
And then they chase you out of there, they come, they get a dog looking for units.

2028
02:56:01.64 --> 02:56:03.64
It's like a serious operation.

2029
02:56:03.64 --> 02:56:08.64
And at some point, you drop your pistol, you get back.

2030
02:56:08.64 --> 02:56:11.64
And, you know, you get, you get away with it.

2031
02:56:11.64 --> 02:56:16.64
Good, where your dad says, hey, your dad, you know, next day or whatever it is, you know,

2032
02:56:16.64 --> 02:56:18.64
dad says, hey, there was someone tried to infiltrate.

2033
02:56:18.64 --> 02:56:21.64
You know anything about that.

2034
02:56:21.64 --> 02:56:22.64
And you lied to him.

2035
02:56:22.64 --> 02:56:24.64
Yep.

2036
02:56:24.64 --> 02:56:30.64
And it seems like you could tell by the look on his face that he knew that you lied to him.

2037
02:56:30.64 --> 02:56:35.64
You suspected you went to bed that night, you pulled down your cover, so to get him bed.

2038
02:56:35.64 --> 02:56:40.64
And there's your, there's your gun. So he knew.

2039
02:56:40.64 --> 02:56:44.64
You talk a lot about integrity and, you know, tell him the truth.

2040
02:56:44.64 --> 02:56:49.64
And I think, you know, when you're, when you're talking about discussing these things up the chain of command,

2041
02:56:49.64 --> 02:56:52.64
and it's, you know, I would, you've got to tell the truth about what's happening.

2042
02:56:52.64 --> 02:56:58.64
But you develop that kind of trust with your whole chain of command from the Secretary of Defense to the President,

2043
02:56:58.64 --> 02:57:03.64
so that when you say something, they actually believe what you're saying.

2044
02:57:03.64 --> 02:57:08.64
And that might, that might seem really like a, like a, like a insignificant thing.

2045
02:57:08.64 --> 02:57:15.64
But if you think about what's writing on this operation for America, for the world,

2046
02:57:15.64 --> 02:57:23.64
if they don't have that like legitimate pure trust in what you're telling them,

2047
02:57:23.64 --> 02:57:26.64
I can't imagine, I can't imagine making a decision,

2048
02:57:26.64 --> 02:57:31.64
giving the go ahead to someone that I don't deeply and truly trust.

2049
02:57:31.64 --> 02:57:33.64
100%

2050
02:57:33.64 --> 02:57:34.64
Yeah.

2051
02:57:34.64 --> 02:57:35.64
Yeah.

2052
02:57:35.64 --> 02:57:37.64
You asked me earlier on about, about my dad.

2053
02:57:37.64 --> 02:57:43.64
And I think, you know, we're all kind of products of our experience, and I was, I was fortunate to be raised by two great parents.

2054
02:57:43.64 --> 02:57:49.64
But my mom stressed it a lot about, you know, the importance of truth and honesty.

2055
02:57:49.64 --> 02:57:52.64
And she expected me to grow up to be a certain type of man.

2056
02:57:52.64 --> 02:57:57.64
I mean, there would open doors for, for ladies that would, you know, take care of women and children.

2057
02:57:57.64 --> 02:58:00.64
I mean, she had this, this vision of me.

2058
02:58:00.64 --> 02:58:05.64
I was going to be a stand-up guy and honest and true and all those sorts of things.

2059
02:58:05.64 --> 02:58:08.64
And you, you always want to make your parents proud.

2060
02:58:08.64 --> 02:58:11.64
And this particular day and you're right, it was 11 years old.

2061
02:58:11.64 --> 02:58:15.64
And we, we tried to get into the same old storage point near LaClaner Air Force Base.

2062
02:58:15.64 --> 02:58:17.64
And we got busted and I dropped the cap gun.

2063
02:58:17.64 --> 02:58:20.64
And when I, and it was a, they are so later, my dad was the head of operations.

2064
02:58:20.64 --> 02:58:22.64
So he was the number three guy at LaClaner Air Force Base.

2065
02:58:22.64 --> 02:58:25.64
So the security guys had reported to him that, and then knew some kids.

2066
02:58:25.64 --> 02:58:29.64
They didn't know who it was, but they knew some kids had tried to break in.

2067
02:58:29.64 --> 02:58:35.64
And, and when my dad confronted me as I said in the book, it's the first and last time I ever lied to my father.

2068
02:58:35.64 --> 02:58:42.64
And, and he never, until he died in 2007, he never raised the issue again.

2069
02:58:42.64 --> 02:58:49.64
And the reason I thought that was interesting parody news because I carried that burden until until he died in 2007.

2070
02:58:49.64 --> 02:58:53.64
But there was another one, I mentioned my time in the Pentagon.

2071
02:58:53.64 --> 02:58:55.64
And again, we all to your point, Chuck.

2072
02:58:55.64 --> 02:59:00.64
I mean, we all are raised with this idea that it is, of course you're going to be honest.

2073
02:59:00.64 --> 02:59:03.64
Yeah, of course you're not going to lie to people.

2074
02:59:03.64 --> 02:59:08.64
And you find, you know, that as you go through life, sometimes that's harder to do than it is to say.

2075
02:59:08.64 --> 02:59:12.64
But when I was in the Pentagon, I worked for a guy named Captain Ted Grabowski.

2076
02:59:12.64 --> 02:59:17.64
And Grabowski, if he had an Americeal, was a little quirky for a seal.

2077
02:59:17.64 --> 02:59:19.64
Didn't look like a seal. He was kind of short and stature.

2078
02:59:19.64 --> 02:59:28.64
But spectacle had more glasses. He'd been in a glider accident and he had a little bit of a limp and so did not look like your typical seal.

2079
02:59:28.64 --> 02:59:34.64
But I found him to be brilliant, hardworking, incredibly insightful, and he knew the Pentagon.

2080
02:59:34.64 --> 02:59:37.64
But it was unlike day one or the first week I was there.

2081
02:59:37.64 --> 02:59:42.64
At one point in time, we're, we're talking about our budget with the three star animal.

2082
02:59:42.64 --> 02:59:46.64
And I thought Grabowski, we had this opportunity.

2083
02:59:46.64 --> 02:59:51.64
We were going to get a whole bunch of money for our ammunition and our, and our, and our, our seal delivery vehicles.

2084
02:59:51.64 --> 02:59:56.64
And the, the animal question Grabowski and he said, do you really need all of this money?

2085
02:59:56.64 --> 03:00:01.64
I mean, can't you take a little slice off the, the ammunition, do you really need that many SDVs?

2086
03:00:01.64 --> 03:00:05.64
And I thought Grabowski's going to stand to he's going to say, absolutely I need that.

2087
03:00:05.64 --> 03:00:08.64
And much of my surprise is, you know what, animal, you're right.

2088
03:00:08.64 --> 03:00:12.64
We can cut our, our ammunition allowance by this.

2089
03:00:12.64 --> 03:00:17.64
We can reduce the number of SDVs from 6 to 3, and I thought, what the hell just happened?

2090
03:00:17.64 --> 03:00:18.64
Why do you do that?

2091
03:00:18.64 --> 03:00:20.64
And afterwards I'm talking to him.

2092
03:00:20.64 --> 03:00:24.64
And he says, look, Belly says, I've got one rule when you're here in the Pentagon.

2093
03:00:24.64 --> 03:00:29.64
He says, never lie or misrepresent the truth.

2094
03:00:29.64 --> 03:00:36.64
Because if you lie or misrepresent the truth, somebody will find out and they will no longer trust you.

2095
03:00:36.64 --> 03:00:40.64
And if they don't trust you, you are of no value to me.

2096
03:00:40.64 --> 03:00:49.64
And it was a little bit of this kind of philosophical linkage between, it wouldn't just about the moral application of being honest.

2097
03:00:49.64 --> 03:00:56.64
There was a practical application as well, which is if you are honest, if you are trustworthy, people will trust you with their money.

2098
03:00:56.64 --> 03:00:58.64
They will trust you with their relationships.

2099
03:00:58.64 --> 03:01:00.64
They will trust you with their lives.

2100
03:01:00.64 --> 03:01:02.64
They will trust you with the big missions.

2101
03:01:02.64 --> 03:01:07.64
And it isn't just about saying, well, I'm just not going to lie.

2102
03:01:07.64 --> 03:01:09.64
Sometimes people misrepresent the truth.

2103
03:01:09.64 --> 03:01:16.64
They embellish things in a way that is to their benefit or in a way that will get them the mission.

2104
03:01:16.64 --> 03:01:22.64
I mean, I knew on the Ben Laden raid, there was no way I was going to mislead the president of the United States.

2105
03:01:22.64 --> 03:01:28.64
And I hope in my time in the military, I didn't mislead anybody.

2106
03:01:28.64 --> 03:01:33.64
At least not willingly and not there, and not intentionally.

2107
03:01:33.64 --> 03:01:42.64
So it is important, not just because we know it's important to be honest, but because if you are not honest and you are not trustworthy, you can't build those relationships.

2108
03:01:42.64 --> 03:01:47.64
If you can't build the relationships, you can't get the job done.

2109
03:01:47.64 --> 03:01:55.64
How many times had you guys, or you seen various units get spun up to go get Ben Laden?

2110
03:01:55.64 --> 03:01:58.64
Yeah, a lot of times.

2111
03:01:58.64 --> 03:02:03.64
And that was part of it when I first was approached by Admiral Mullin and Afghanistan.

2112
03:02:03.64 --> 03:02:05.64
He said, hey, see, I got to lead on Ben Laden.

2113
03:02:05.64 --> 03:02:09.64
I mean, I was respectful to Admiral Mullin, of course, but I'm thinking of seeing this picture before.

2114
03:02:09.64 --> 03:02:13.64
I mean, we had him in the Hindu Church, we had him in Torabore again.

2115
03:02:13.64 --> 03:02:16.64
We'd had him in Pakistan a number of times.

2116
03:02:16.64 --> 03:02:19.64
I mean, he was trying to find Waldo.

2117
03:02:19.64 --> 03:02:22.64
I mean, it seemed like Ben Laden was ever, I remember one point of time.

2118
03:02:22.64 --> 03:02:26.64
He was a little bit of a speed on him up in the Hindu Church.

2119
03:02:26.64 --> 03:02:30.64
It was something like, you know, 12, 14,000 feet or something like that.

2120
03:02:30.64 --> 03:02:34.64
Up in the middle of nowhere, and somebody said he's hiding in a cave up there.

2121
03:02:34.64 --> 03:02:38.64
So because he ought to do with so high, I could only put two guys on the 47.

2122
03:02:38.64 --> 03:02:44.64
I put an Air Force SDS guy and one of the guy, and so the helicopter can barely make it up to altitude.

2123
03:02:44.64 --> 03:02:47.64
And of course, this is just a wild goose chase.

2124
03:02:47.64 --> 03:02:51.64
But they came back and said the young, they was a captain or a major comes to briefing.

2125
03:02:51.64 --> 03:02:53.64
And I was like, well, I was obviously at Ben Laden.

2126
03:02:53.64 --> 03:02:56.64
But there were footsteps up there in the snow.

2127
03:02:56.64 --> 03:02:58.64
And I'm like, really?

2128
03:02:58.64 --> 03:03:03.64
He said, out in the middle of nowhere, we followed these footsteps into this kind of little cave.

2129
03:03:03.64 --> 03:03:05.64
Very, I'm thinking, really.

2130
03:03:05.64 --> 03:03:07.64
Of course, it was not Ben Laden.

2131
03:03:07.64 --> 03:03:08.64
It was something.

2132
03:03:08.64 --> 03:03:10.64
But it was, so yeah, we had a lot of leads like that.

2133
03:03:10.64 --> 03:03:16.64
We had some leads in Pakistan that, I mean, I remember seeing a little careful about this.

2134
03:03:16.64 --> 03:03:18.64
But I remember seeing Intel.

2135
03:03:18.64 --> 03:03:20.64
And I looked at and said, well, that's him.

2136
03:03:20.64 --> 03:03:23.64
There's no question in my mind, but it wasn't him.

2137
03:03:23.64 --> 03:03:27.64
Because in fact, he was in that compound in a bottom-odd for probably five years.

2138
03:03:27.64 --> 03:03:29.64
And never left that compound.

2139
03:03:29.64 --> 03:03:33.64
So yeah, there were a lot of leads out there, but this was the only one in the panda.

2140
03:03:33.64 --> 03:03:40.64
What was the timeline from the first time you talked to Admiral Mones that he said he had a lead and execute?

2141
03:03:40.64 --> 03:03:45.64
Yeah, so he approached me in December of 2010.

2142
03:03:45.64 --> 03:03:51.64
I didn't, I wasn't asked to come back to the states until January or February of 2011.

2143
03:03:51.64 --> 03:03:54.64
So in the February timeframe, I spent a lot of time with C.I.

2144
03:03:54.64 --> 03:03:56.64
Kind of looking at the Intel.

2145
03:03:56.64 --> 03:03:59.64
And then I think I had my first meeting with the president sometime in March,

2146
03:03:59.64 --> 03:04:02.64
and then we had a bunch of meetings between March and the end of April.

2147
03:04:02.64 --> 03:04:08.64
And so April 30th is somewhere around there, it's one I love for Afghanistan, maybe April 29th.

2148
03:04:08.64 --> 03:04:12.64
And then God definitely, Afghanistan, and then we launched two days later.

2149
03:04:12.64 --> 03:04:14.64
And how was the timeline for the boys?

2150
03:04:14.64 --> 03:04:15.64
From that meeting?

2151
03:04:15.64 --> 03:04:17.64
From that meeting when they signed the non-disclosures.

2152
03:04:17.64 --> 03:04:22.64
Yeah, so that was probably five weeks, four or five weeks.

2153
03:04:22.64 --> 03:04:28.64
So that was, so we spent three weeks, you know, briefing up, doing all the rehearsals.

2154
03:04:28.64 --> 03:04:34.64
And then at the end of that three weeks, when I went back and met with the president said we can do this.

2155
03:04:34.64 --> 03:04:37.64
Yeah, I think that was towards the end of April.

2156
03:04:37.64 --> 03:04:42.64
So I had the General Tony Thomas, who was my number two guy there at J.S.

2157
03:04:42.64 --> 03:04:49.64
I had to stay in Washington, and I said, okay, Tony, let's get the guys from the states.

2158
03:04:49.64 --> 03:04:50.64
Let's get them moved out there now.

2159
03:04:50.64 --> 03:04:56.64
So Tony and Longa P. Van Housier, and of course we had CIA and national security agencies and national security,

2160
03:04:56.64 --> 03:05:00.64
especially agency and a whole kind of interagency group that went with us.

2161
03:05:00.64 --> 03:05:05.64
But Tony's got to set up in this little talk, tackle operations center there in J.B.

2162
03:05:05.64 --> 03:05:12.64
And so when I came out, I mean, it was the guys who said everything was ready to go.

2163
03:05:12.64 --> 03:05:18.64
I ended up rolling it about what we were going to launch on Saturday, but there was some fog in the area in the temperature.

2164
03:05:18.64 --> 03:05:20.64
It was a little high at the time.

2165
03:05:20.64 --> 03:05:26.64
So I rolled it 24 hours and then we pressed forward on Sunday.

2166
03:05:26.64 --> 03:05:31.64
Like I said, you got to get the book for the details and all leading up to this.

2167
03:05:31.64 --> 03:05:35.64
But there's one little part I wanted to cover.

2168
03:05:35.64 --> 03:05:37.64
The missions be actually being executed.

2169
03:05:37.64 --> 03:05:40.64
So you're in the in the operation center.

2170
03:05:40.64 --> 03:05:41.64
And here we go.

2171
03:05:41.64 --> 03:05:45.64
Inside the Joc, I was getting updates from Van Housier and Thompson.

2172
03:05:45.64 --> 03:05:46.64
The seals were clearing.

2173
03:05:46.64 --> 03:05:52.64
We're still clearing the three story house and the healos were holding their position outside a bottom.

2174
03:05:52.64 --> 03:05:56.64
I looked up at the clock 15 minutes had passed since the assault began.

2175
03:05:56.64 --> 03:05:58.64
Sir, the squadron commander is on the radio.

2176
03:05:58.64 --> 03:06:00.64
Van Housier alerted me.

2177
03:06:00.64 --> 03:06:02.64
The voice was unmistakable.

2178
03:06:02.64 --> 03:06:05.64
Deep calm in control.

2179
03:06:05.64 --> 03:06:08.64
This is Romeo 6-6.

2180
03:06:08.64 --> 03:06:11.64
He paused and you could hear a small shutter in his voice.

2181
03:06:11.64 --> 03:06:17.64
For God and Country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo.

2182
03:06:17.64 --> 03:06:21.64
The hunt for the most wanted man in the world was over.

2183
03:06:21.64 --> 03:06:23.64
We had gotten been ladden.

2184
03:06:23.64 --> 03:06:28.64
The Joc erupted in cheers immediately followed by Van Housier's booming voice.

2185
03:06:28.64 --> 03:06:31.64
Shut the fuck up, he yelled.

2186
03:06:31.64 --> 03:06:33.64
We still have to get these guys home.

2187
03:06:33.64 --> 03:06:36.64
The Joc immediately, quieted down.

2188
03:06:36.64 --> 03:06:37.64
Van Housier was right.

2189
03:06:37.64 --> 03:06:39.64
We still had a long way to go.

2190
03:06:39.64 --> 03:06:41.64
I had no sense of relief.

2191
03:06:41.64 --> 03:06:43.64
No internal exhilaration.

2192
03:06:43.64 --> 03:06:44.64
No feeling of victory.

2193
03:06:44.64 --> 03:06:47.64
The mission was not over.

2194
03:06:47.64 --> 03:06:51.64
And when I read that, I just thought to myself,

2195
03:06:51.64 --> 03:06:55.64
I mean, what a freaking professional Van Housier.

2196
03:06:55.64 --> 03:07:00.64
And you could see, I mean, here it is, you know, the ultimate mission,

2197
03:07:00.64 --> 03:07:04.64
capturing the ultimate bad guy, or killing the ultimate bad guy.

2198
03:07:04.64 --> 03:07:08.64
And everyone's all excited and Van Housier's just on point.

2199
03:07:08.64 --> 03:07:10.64
Just no deviation.

2200
03:07:10.64 --> 03:07:11.64
It's all for us.

2201
03:07:11.64 --> 03:07:12.64
Yeah.

2202
03:07:12.64 --> 03:07:13.64
Freaking outstanding.

2203
03:07:13.64 --> 03:07:18.64
And it's interesting, too, because you call back and say, yep, we got Geronimo.

2204
03:07:18.64 --> 03:07:19.64
We got it done.

2205
03:07:19.64 --> 03:07:21.64
And then you realize, wait, is he dead or alive?

2206
03:07:21.64 --> 03:07:25.64
Well, I had to report back to Panetta.

2207
03:07:25.64 --> 03:07:26.64
Yeah.

2208
03:07:26.64 --> 03:07:27.64
I think he'd heard the Geronimo.

2209
03:07:27.64 --> 03:07:30.64
And I just said, you know, Geronimo, then I thought,

2210
03:07:30.64 --> 03:07:33.64
shit, because, you know, much everybody thinks that this was a kill only mission.

2211
03:07:33.64 --> 03:07:34.64
It was not.

2212
03:07:34.64 --> 03:07:37.64
We had a plan to capture him if, in fact, to gave up.

2213
03:07:37.64 --> 03:07:39.64
And there was clearly not a threat.

2214
03:07:39.64 --> 03:07:41.64
And then I realized, I don't know whether he's dead or alive.

2215
03:07:41.64 --> 03:07:44.64
So I had to call back down to the squadden commander and say,

2216
03:07:44.64 --> 03:07:45.64
Geronimo, E.K.I.A.

2217
03:07:45.64 --> 03:07:47.64
Question mark E.K.I.A.

2218
03:07:47.64 --> 03:07:49.64
So there was a few second pause.

2219
03:07:49.64 --> 03:07:51.64
I think the guys in the White House and they were like,

2220
03:07:51.64 --> 03:07:55.64
I thought he had to report it Geronimo as I said, no, he's dead.

2221
03:07:55.64 --> 03:07:57.64
So let's make sure we understand it.

2222
03:07:57.64 --> 03:08:02.64
I mean, like I said, you go into what happened after that.

2223
03:08:02.64 --> 03:08:04.64
It's just an incredible story.

2224
03:08:04.64 --> 03:08:07.64
I mean, obviously it's incredible story.

2225
03:08:07.64 --> 03:08:10.64
Get the book to check that stuff out.

2226
03:08:10.64 --> 03:08:16.64
Before it closes out the book, C. Stories is one, one other little section I wanted to cover.

2227
03:08:16.64 --> 03:08:21.64
It's from a chapter called The Greatest, The Next Greatest Generation.

2228
03:08:21.64 --> 03:08:25.64
And this takes, this is second takes place in 2007.

2229
03:08:25.64 --> 03:08:27.64
We mentioned that you are in Europe for a time.

2230
03:08:27.64 --> 03:08:30.64
You're in charge of all special operations forces in Europe and Africa.

2231
03:08:30.64 --> 03:08:34.64
But that means you're actually over in Germany most of the time.

2232
03:08:34.64 --> 03:08:38.64
And in this part, you're visiting wounded soldiers on their way home

2233
03:08:38.64 --> 03:08:39.64
from Iraq and Afghanistan.

2234
03:08:39.64 --> 03:08:42.64
So on the way home from Iraq and Afghanistan, oftentimes,

2235
03:08:42.64 --> 03:08:48.64
the soldiers, the wounded would stop in Germany at long stool.

2236
03:08:48.64 --> 03:08:52.64
And you would go there to visit these wounded guys.

2237
03:08:52.64 --> 03:08:56.64
And you talk about one of these cases here.

2238
03:08:56.64 --> 03:08:59.64
So you're going into visit.

2239
03:08:59.64 --> 03:09:01.64
Going to the book.

2240
03:09:01.64 --> 03:09:04.64
The doctor nodded and I pushed the door open and entered.

2241
03:09:04.64 --> 03:09:07.64
Lying on the bed completely naked was a young soldier,

2242
03:09:07.64 --> 03:09:09.64
not more than 25 years old.

2243
03:09:09.64 --> 03:09:12.64
His body was swollen from the impact of the blast.

2244
03:09:12.64 --> 03:09:17.64
Burns covered the upper half of his torso and below his waist he had lost half of one leg

2245
03:09:17.64 --> 03:09:19.64
and much of the other.

2246
03:09:19.64 --> 03:09:23.64
His face was so badly damaged that his eyes were almost sealed shut

2247
03:09:23.64 --> 03:09:26.64
and his lips burned clean off.

2248
03:09:26.64 --> 03:09:30.64
Life saving tubes extended from just about every orifice in his body

2249
03:09:30.64 --> 03:09:34.64
and monitors around the room beaped continuously.

2250
03:09:34.64 --> 03:09:37.64
Sir, he can't talk, but he can hear you.

2251
03:09:37.64 --> 03:09:40.64
And he likes to engage people. The doctor said,

2252
03:09:40.64 --> 03:09:43.64
I slowly walked up beside the bed.

2253
03:09:43.64 --> 03:09:46.64
Hey partner, my name's Admiral McCraven.

2254
03:09:46.64 --> 03:09:49.64
I could see him acknowledge my presence.

2255
03:09:49.64 --> 03:09:51.64
You look like shit.

2256
03:09:51.64 --> 03:09:55.64
He managed to smile and reach out his hand toward the nightstand.

2257
03:09:55.64 --> 03:09:58.64
The doctor grabbed a clipboard and handed it to the soldier.

2258
03:09:58.64 --> 03:10:00.64
He likes to write out his responses.

2259
03:10:00.64 --> 03:10:03.64
The doctor said, pulling the attached pen from its holder.

2260
03:10:03.64 --> 03:10:06.64
He scribbled on the note pad.

2261
03:10:06.64 --> 03:10:09.64
You should see the other guy.

2262
03:10:09.64 --> 03:10:12.64
I laughed and he chuckled with me.

2263
03:10:12.64 --> 03:10:14.64
Looks like they're taking good care of you.

2264
03:10:14.64 --> 03:10:15.64
Is there anything you need?

2265
03:10:15.64 --> 03:10:18.64
Once again, he grabbed the clipboard and wrote,

2266
03:10:18.64 --> 03:10:21.64
A, beer.

2267
03:10:21.64 --> 03:10:24.64
The doctor looked at me and reluctantly shook his head.

2268
03:10:24.64 --> 03:10:25.64
Well, tell you what.

2269
03:10:25.64 --> 03:10:28.64
When you get back to the states, get well and the beers on me.

2270
03:10:28.64 --> 03:10:29.64
He just nodded.

2271
03:10:29.64 --> 03:10:31.64
I was struggling with what to say.

2272
03:10:31.64 --> 03:10:33.64
I had been in these situations hundreds of times before

2273
03:10:33.64 --> 03:10:35.64
and all you could do is make small talk.

2274
03:10:35.64 --> 03:10:39.64
Normally, I knew the soldier was unit and I had something more significant to offer.

2275
03:10:39.64 --> 03:10:41.64
I walked around to the doctor's side to the bed.

2276
03:10:41.64 --> 03:10:43.64
See a marine or a soldier?

2277
03:10:43.64 --> 03:10:45.64
I whispered to the doctor.

2278
03:10:45.64 --> 03:10:46.64
Sir, I don't know.

2279
03:10:46.64 --> 03:10:47.64
I'm just the attending physician.

2280
03:10:47.64 --> 03:10:48.64
I can find out for you though.

2281
03:10:48.64 --> 03:10:50.64
No, not necessarily.

2282
03:10:50.64 --> 03:10:51.64
Not necessary.

2283
03:10:51.64 --> 03:10:53.64
Walking back around to my side to the bed,

2284
03:10:53.64 --> 03:10:54.64
I leaned over to the young man and asked,

2285
03:10:54.64 --> 03:10:56.64
Are you a marine or a soldier?

2286
03:10:56.64 --> 03:10:59.64
He seemed agitated by the question.

2287
03:10:59.64 --> 03:11:01.64
He pointed to a tattoo that was etched on his thigh.

2288
03:11:01.64 --> 03:11:04.64
He must have assumed that the tattoo is fully visible.

2289
03:11:04.64 --> 03:11:06.64
But the blast had burned the leg so badly

2290
03:11:06.64 --> 03:11:08.64
that only a smudged outline appeared.

2291
03:11:08.64 --> 03:11:12.64
I looked closely and could see the image of a big red one,

2292
03:11:12.64 --> 03:11:14.64
the first infantry division.

2293
03:11:14.64 --> 03:11:17.64
Your soldier, I commented,

2294
03:11:17.64 --> 03:11:18.64
he grabbed the clipboard.

2295
03:11:18.64 --> 03:11:20.64
Infantry hero.

2296
03:11:20.64 --> 03:11:21.64
Infantry.

2297
03:11:21.64 --> 03:11:24.64
The toughest occupation in the army, I thought.

2298
03:11:24.64 --> 03:11:26.64
The soldiers are always marching,

2299
03:11:26.64 --> 03:11:29.64
always carrying a rucksack, always in the line of fire.

2300
03:11:29.64 --> 03:11:33.64
You have to be strong and fit to last in any infantry unit,

2301
03:11:33.64 --> 03:11:35.64
particularly during war.

2302
03:11:35.64 --> 03:11:38.64
As I glance at the young man's battered body,

2303
03:11:38.64 --> 03:11:41.64
I wonder if he fully understood the degree of his injuries.

2304
03:11:41.64 --> 03:11:44.64
He noticed me assessing his physical condition,

2305
03:11:44.64 --> 03:11:48.64
and suddenly a look of defiance came across his swollen face.

2306
03:11:48.64 --> 03:11:52.64
He rolled in my direction and then wrote slowly in capital letters,

2307
03:11:52.64 --> 03:11:55.64
I will be infantry again.

2308
03:11:55.64 --> 03:12:02.64
So that's, you know,

2309
03:12:02.64 --> 03:12:05.64
like you said, it's something that you witnessed hundreds of times.

2310
03:12:05.64 --> 03:12:07.64
And one thing that you write in the books,

2311
03:12:07.64 --> 03:12:10.64
and I've heard you talk about it as well,

2312
03:12:10.64 --> 03:12:17.64
is with all these wounded soldiers that you've,

2313
03:12:17.64 --> 03:12:21.64
soldiers say, there's airmen and Marines that you've gone and talked to,

2314
03:12:21.64 --> 03:12:23.64
every single one of them,

2315
03:12:23.64 --> 03:12:26.64
every single one of them has just wanted to get back there,

2316
03:12:26.64 --> 03:12:29.64
you know, and get back in the fight.

2317
03:12:29.64 --> 03:12:32.64
Yeah, and you've been there, you know, that,

2318
03:12:32.64 --> 03:12:34.64
and it is remarkable to me.

2319
03:12:34.64 --> 03:12:36.64
And I think of the, to your point,

2320
03:12:36.64 --> 03:12:38.64
you know, hundreds of these guys that I've met.

2321
03:12:38.64 --> 03:12:41.64
Never once did I hear anybody complain.

2322
03:12:41.64 --> 03:12:44.64
I mean, guys at the Lost Arms and Legs and Plass victims,

2323
03:12:44.64 --> 03:12:47.64
and they didn't complain.

2324
03:12:47.64 --> 03:12:49.64
I just, just amazing to me.

2325
03:12:49.64 --> 03:12:51.64
I don't know if I tell the story in that book,

2326
03:12:51.64 --> 03:12:53.64
but I've told the story before.

2327
03:12:53.64 --> 03:12:58.64
I was so calm commander, I went up to Walter Reed,

2328
03:12:58.64 --> 03:13:00.64
and I used to appear out to the same thing

2329
03:13:00.64 --> 03:13:02.64
when the guys would get back.

2330
03:13:02.64 --> 03:13:03.64
And, um,

2331
03:13:11.64 --> 03:13:13.64
I know I had, um,

2332
03:13:13.64 --> 03:13:14.64
before you jump into that,

2333
03:13:14.64 --> 03:13:17.64
I had one of my guys Ryan Job,

2334
03:13:17.64 --> 03:13:20.64
who was shot in the face.

2335
03:13:20.64 --> 03:13:22.64
He was blinded.

2336
03:13:22.64 --> 03:13:25.64
And I'm talking to him, you know,

2337
03:13:25.64 --> 03:13:26.64
he's back.

2338
03:13:26.64 --> 03:13:27.64
He's at, I think he's at Bethesda.

2339
03:13:27.64 --> 03:13:29.64
And I'm talking to him from Ramadi.

2340
03:13:29.64 --> 03:13:34.64
And, you know, he's begging me to come back.

2341
03:13:34.64 --> 03:13:37.64
And he says, you know, sir,

2342
03:13:37.64 --> 03:13:39.64
I'll get my pig, you know, he's a pig gunner.

2343
03:13:39.64 --> 03:13:40.64
He's a 60 gunner.

2344
03:13:40.64 --> 03:13:42.64
He goes, sir, give me my pig.

2345
03:13:42.64 --> 03:13:44.64
Don't worry, I might not be able to see him,

2346
03:13:44.64 --> 03:13:45.64
but I can smell him.

2347
03:13:45.64 --> 03:13:46.64
I'll get him.

2348
03:13:46.64 --> 03:13:49.64
And, you know, there's just the attitude

2349
03:13:49.64 --> 03:13:51.64
and same thing with the first guy

2350
03:13:51.64 --> 03:13:53.64
that I had that got badly wounded.

2351
03:13:53.64 --> 03:13:54.64
Guy named Cowie.

2352
03:13:54.64 --> 03:13:55.64
Cowie.

2353
03:13:55.64 --> 03:13:57.64
And Cowie was, you know,

2354
03:13:57.64 --> 03:13:58.64
we know if he's going to keep his leg,

2355
03:13:58.64 --> 03:13:59.64
but he was shot up bad.

2356
03:13:59.64 --> 03:14:01.64
He's on morphine or whatever he's on.

2357
03:14:01.64 --> 03:14:02.64
And we, we'd have been in Ramadi

2358
03:14:02.64 --> 03:14:04.64
for a very short period of time at this point.

2359
03:14:04.64 --> 03:14:07.64
And I get to the, to the, to the,

2360
03:14:07.64 --> 03:14:09.64
Charlie Med,

2361
03:14:09.64 --> 03:14:11.64
the field medical area.

2362
03:14:11.64 --> 03:14:12.64
And I roll in there.

2363
03:14:12.64 --> 03:14:16.64
And he's, you know, he, he holds out his hand.

2364
03:14:16.64 --> 03:14:17.64
And, and I grab his hand.

2365
03:14:17.64 --> 03:14:19.64
And he like pulls me in close.

2366
03:14:19.64 --> 03:14:22.64
And he just whispers, he's, you know,

2367
03:14:22.64 --> 03:14:23.64
sir, let me stay.

2368
03:14:23.64 --> 03:14:25.64
I'll sweep up just please let me stay.

2369
03:14:25.64 --> 03:14:26.64
Don't send me home.

2370
03:14:26.64 --> 03:14:28.64
And, and you know, here's a guy.

2371
03:14:28.64 --> 03:14:31.64
That's a freaking incredible athlete, incredible guy.

2372
03:14:31.64 --> 03:14:33.64
And we don't know if he's going to keep his leg.

2373
03:14:33.64 --> 03:14:36.64
And the only thing he cares about is, you know,

2374
03:14:36.64 --> 03:14:38.64
can I stay?

2375
03:14:38.64 --> 03:14:39.64
Right.

2376
03:14:39.64 --> 03:14:41.64
Yeah, and this, again,

2377
03:14:41.64 --> 03:14:43.64
it seemed like it was a course of this assault guy.

2378
03:14:43.64 --> 03:14:45.64
I just saw it again and again with all the guys that we encounter.

2379
03:14:45.64 --> 03:14:48.64
But this one particular visit I had up to Walter Reed.

2380
03:14:48.64 --> 03:14:50.64
I'd come up see some of our kind of soft guys

2381
03:14:50.64 --> 03:14:53.64
Rangers and, and others who'd been wounded and

2382
03:14:53.64 --> 03:14:55.64
and of course Walter Reed was where we sent the

2383
03:14:55.64 --> 03:14:57.64
frankly the most seriously injured certainly the

2384
03:14:57.64 --> 03:15:00.64
blast victims and the, and the amputees.

2385
03:15:00.64 --> 03:15:03.64
The burn victims generally went to down the Fort Sam.

2386
03:15:03.64 --> 03:15:06.64
But I'm up there visiting a couple of guys and talking to them

2387
03:15:06.64 --> 03:15:08.64
and they're wives and everything.

2388
03:15:08.64 --> 03:15:09.64
And you know, you know how to talk to these guy.

2389
03:15:09.64 --> 03:15:11.64
I mean, there, there guys that that are our

2390
03:15:11.64 --> 03:15:14.64
Rangers or Delta operators or our seals and,

2391
03:15:14.64 --> 03:15:15.64
and that particular day,

2392
03:15:15.64 --> 03:15:17.64
there were three or four of them there.

2393
03:15:17.64 --> 03:15:19.64
And then afterwards the sergeant major is escorting

2394
03:15:19.64 --> 03:15:22.64
the rounds to say, sir, there's somebody else like you to meet.

2395
03:15:22.64 --> 03:15:23.64
He's not a soft guy.

2396
03:15:23.64 --> 03:15:26.64
He's with a 25th Infantry Division.

2397
03:15:26.64 --> 03:15:29.64
And he was in Iraq and a vehicle vehicle got hit by an

2398
03:15:29.64 --> 03:15:30.64
explosive form of check dial.

2399
03:15:30.64 --> 03:15:33.64
He is a quadruple amputee.

2400
03:15:33.64 --> 03:15:36.64
And I said, absolutely, I'd love to go meeting.

2401
03:15:36.64 --> 03:15:40.64
So I go up to the, to the second floor of the rehab center there.

2402
03:15:40.64 --> 03:15:42.64
I see the young man standing off the side and he's kind of

2403
03:15:42.64 --> 03:15:43.64
leaning up against the rail.

2404
03:15:43.64 --> 03:15:46.64
And of course he's only about yay big because he's got in

2405
03:15:46.64 --> 03:15:50.64
a legs. And so I come over to talk to him and I kneel down so I can kind of

2406
03:15:50.64 --> 03:15:53.64
get eye to eye with him and I just, I know what to say.

2407
03:15:53.64 --> 03:15:56.64
I mean, what do you tell a young kid who's lost both his legs,

2408
03:15:56.64 --> 03:15:58.64
all of one arm and most of the other arm?

2409
03:15:58.64 --> 03:16:00.64
And so as I'm trying to make some small talk,

2410
03:16:00.64 --> 03:16:03.64
I mean, you obviously saw some in my eyes, you know,

2411
03:16:03.64 --> 03:16:05.64
the pity or a morse or something.

2412
03:16:05.64 --> 03:16:08.64
And Terrence me says, sir, I'm 24 years old.

2413
03:16:08.64 --> 03:16:10.64
I'm going to be just fine.

2414
03:16:10.64 --> 03:16:12.64
I never forgot that.

2415
03:16:12.64 --> 03:16:14.64
I'm 24 years old.

2416
03:16:14.64 --> 03:16:16.64
I'm going to be just fine.

2417
03:16:16.64 --> 03:16:17.64
And all he want to do was,

2418
03:16:17.64 --> 03:16:19.64
does unit was still in a rack.

2419
03:16:19.64 --> 03:16:23.64
And he said, can you get me back to Hawaii so I can be there

2420
03:16:23.64 --> 03:16:25.64
when the 25th anniversary division comes back?

2421
03:16:25.64 --> 03:16:28.64
So I think we can manage that.

2422
03:16:28.64 --> 03:16:29.64
And we did.

2423
03:16:29.64 --> 03:16:31.64
And he was able to get there and meet his unit.

2424
03:16:31.64 --> 03:16:34.64
And I came back.

2425
03:16:34.64 --> 03:16:36.64
Well, outstanding.

2426
03:16:36.64 --> 03:16:39.64
And that's, you know, again, a lot of the book is obviously

2427
03:16:39.64 --> 03:16:43.64
focuses around special operations and as you point out,

2428
03:16:43.64 --> 03:16:50.64
and as we both know, the sacrifices made by the entirety of the US military

2429
03:16:50.64 --> 03:16:54.64
is just, it's incredible.

2430
03:16:54.64 --> 03:16:57.64
It's incredible in the bravery.

2431
03:16:57.64 --> 03:17:00.64
The bravery doesn't stay in one unit.

2432
03:17:00.64 --> 03:17:04.64
It's in all these units and incredible to see.

2433
03:17:04.64 --> 03:17:12.64
You end up as the bull frog in the seal teams.

2434
03:17:12.64 --> 03:17:17.64
Which is, which means that you, at whatever many,

2435
03:17:17.64 --> 03:17:19.64
maybe you had it for a year or two, I'm not sure.

2436
03:17:19.64 --> 03:17:23.64
But that means you had more time in the seal teams than anybody else in the

2437
03:17:23.64 --> 03:17:25.64
seal teams at that time on active duty.

2438
03:17:25.64 --> 03:17:26.64
Right.

2439
03:17:26.64 --> 03:17:28.64
How long did you, how long are you the bull frog for?

2440
03:17:28.64 --> 03:17:30.64
So, both are for three years.

2441
03:17:30.64 --> 03:17:35.64
So I, I shared, so I, I was made the bull frog at 34 years

2442
03:17:35.64 --> 03:17:36.64
into the teams.

2443
03:17:36.64 --> 03:17:39.64
And I shared it with the guy named Brian Sebenahler, who was probably a captain of the

2444
03:17:39.64 --> 03:17:42.64
time, but Brian and I had gone through training together.

2445
03:17:42.64 --> 03:17:46.64
So, and Brian was young and listed the trooper when we went through training.

2446
03:17:46.64 --> 03:17:49.64
And of course, you went, I think you made senior chief in the Matocio.

2447
03:17:49.64 --> 03:17:51.64
And has a long career as an officer.

2448
03:17:51.64 --> 03:17:53.64
Absolutely fabulous officer, great friend.

2449
03:17:53.64 --> 03:17:55.64
I hope to run into him while I'm here.

2450
03:17:55.64 --> 03:17:57.64
So Brian and I, because we've been in the same class,

2451
03:17:57.64 --> 03:18:01.64
we, we shared the, the bull frog for a couple years and Brian retired.

2452
03:18:01.64 --> 03:18:05.64
And I, I think I ended up flying solo for about the last year of my time as the

2453
03:18:05.64 --> 03:18:09.64
Socom commander, but you have the last three years.

2454
03:18:09.64 --> 03:18:12.64
Yeah, I mean, part of this was just long and Jevety.

2455
03:18:12.64 --> 03:18:14.64
You know, you just, you keep swinging away.

2456
03:18:14.64 --> 03:18:17.64
And yeah, 37 years, but it goes by fast.

2457
03:18:17.64 --> 03:18:19.64
And I was, I had a chance to talk to one of the,

2458
03:18:19.64 --> 03:18:22.64
the seal classes yesterday.

2459
03:18:22.64 --> 03:18:25.64
And I said, let me, let me tell you a little story.

2460
03:18:25.64 --> 03:18:28.64
I said, you know, when I retired in 2014,

2461
03:18:28.64 --> 03:18:32.64
and I, I had a chance to be the Chancellor of the University of Texas system.

2462
03:18:32.64 --> 03:18:34.64
So, 230,000 kids, 100,000 employees.

2463
03:18:34.64 --> 03:18:36.64
Great great opportunity.

2464
03:18:36.64 --> 03:18:45.64
But I would meet these, you know, these, these very successful captains of industry that

2465
03:18:45.64 --> 03:18:47.64
were billionaires.

2466
03:18:47.64 --> 03:18:48.64
You know, never where you went.

2467
03:18:48.64 --> 03:18:49.64
And they were, they were great.

2468
03:18:49.64 --> 03:18:50.64
They were actually very, very good people.

2469
03:18:50.64 --> 03:18:53.64
I really enjoyed the folks that I had a chance to meet.

2470
03:18:53.64 --> 03:18:56.64
But they were all invious of me.

2471
03:18:56.64 --> 03:19:00.64
And all the money in the world could not get them the opportunity to lock out of a submarine

2472
03:19:00.64 --> 03:19:05.64
or fast-rope out of a helo or, you know, jump out of a plane from 30,000 feet at night

2473
03:19:05.64 --> 03:19:06.64
on 02.

2474
03:19:06.64 --> 03:19:12.64
And as successful as they had been, they didn't have the experiences.

2475
03:19:12.64 --> 03:19:16.64
They didn't have 37 years of being in a locker room,

2476
03:19:16.64 --> 03:19:20.64
being with the guys, getting harassed every day in a good natured manner.

2477
03:19:20.64 --> 03:19:23.64
And, and being with guys, we're sacrificing to their families,

2478
03:19:23.64 --> 03:19:24.64
it we're sacrificing.

2479
03:19:24.64 --> 03:19:26.64
They didn't have that experience.

2480
03:19:26.64 --> 03:19:29.64
So I told these young students going through buzz.

2481
03:19:29.64 --> 03:19:30.64
I said, guys, let me tell you something.

2482
03:19:30.64 --> 03:19:32.64
You still got there in second phase.

2483
03:19:32.64 --> 03:19:34.64
So I still got a long ways to go.

2484
03:19:34.64 --> 03:19:37.64
I said, you're going to have those days still left in training,

2485
03:19:37.64 --> 03:19:39.64
or you're going to want to quit.

2486
03:19:39.64 --> 03:19:40.64
Don't do it.

2487
03:19:40.64 --> 03:19:43.64
Don't do it because once you've penned that tried and on,

2488
03:19:43.64 --> 03:19:45.64
your life changes forever.

2489
03:19:45.64 --> 03:19:47.64
And you'll have hard days in the teams.

2490
03:19:47.64 --> 03:19:49.64
I mean, you're absolutely going to have hard days.

2491
03:19:49.64 --> 03:19:50.64
And I said, I was fired.

2492
03:19:50.64 --> 03:19:52.64
I had missions that didn't go well.

2493
03:19:52.64 --> 03:19:54.64
But when you look back over your time in the teams,

2494
03:19:54.64 --> 03:19:57.64
whether you spent four years or 40 years,

2495
03:19:57.64 --> 03:19:59.64
you'll never regret a moment of it.

2496
03:19:59.64 --> 03:20:03.64
Because you're going to have friends and stories and adventures

2497
03:20:03.64 --> 03:20:07.64
that your, you know, your friends from high school and college,

2498
03:20:07.64 --> 03:20:09.64
and we'll never have had.

2499
03:20:09.64 --> 03:20:13.64
And when you're old and gray like I am and you're sitting in your rock

2500
03:20:13.64 --> 03:20:15.64
and chair and you're be able to look back on that and say,

2501
03:20:15.64 --> 03:20:16.64
you know what?

2502
03:20:16.64 --> 03:20:17.64
That was pretty good run.

2503
03:20:17.64 --> 03:20:19.64
I wouldn't try to for anything.

2504
03:20:19.64 --> 03:20:22.64
The person that you shared the,

2505
03:20:22.64 --> 03:20:24.64
the Beau Frog with.

2506
03:20:24.64 --> 03:20:24.64
Yep.

2507
03:20:24.64 --> 03:20:25.64
Yeah.

2508
03:20:25.64 --> 03:20:26.64
He was my, he was my Ptunkman.

2509
03:20:26.64 --> 03:20:27.64
There you go.

2510
03:20:27.64 --> 03:20:28.64
Yeah.

2511
03:20:28.64 --> 03:20:32.64
You mentioned, you know, earlier today we were talking.

2512
03:20:32.64 --> 03:20:35.64
And you mentioned something else about the tried it.

2513
03:20:35.64 --> 03:20:39.64
And who owns that tried it.

2514
03:20:39.64 --> 03:20:40.64
Yeah.

2515
03:20:40.64 --> 03:20:41.64
Yeah.

2516
03:20:41.64 --> 03:20:43.64
Same thing talking to the, the guys going through training.

2517
03:20:43.64 --> 03:20:45.64
I said, look, you know, if you get your tried it,

2518
03:20:45.64 --> 03:20:51.64
you need to understand it's not your tried it's not Joe's tried it's not Jon's tried it.

2519
03:20:51.64 --> 03:20:55.64
It's, it's, it's all of our tried it's you represent everybody that

2520
03:20:55.64 --> 03:21:02.64
ever wore a tried and everybody that's ever going to wear a tried and so you have a responsibility

2521
03:21:02.64 --> 03:21:10.64
as a member of this community to wear that tried and with honor with dignity every single day.

2522
03:21:10.64 --> 03:21:14.64
And I, I also told him another story about you,

2523
03:21:14.64 --> 03:21:16.64
you mentioned the parachute accident.

2524
03:21:16.64 --> 03:21:20.64
And after my parachute accident about a year and a half afterwards,

2525
03:21:20.64 --> 03:21:24.64
I'm still in the White House and I go down to the Naval Special War for group two.

2526
03:21:24.64 --> 03:21:27.64
And the Commodore was having a commander's conference.

2527
03:21:27.64 --> 03:21:29.64
So all the officers had kind of assembled there.

2528
03:21:29.64 --> 03:21:32.64
And I'm still, I'm barely walking well by now,

2529
03:21:32.64 --> 03:21:34.64
but you know, we're going to do a team guys do.

2530
03:21:34.64 --> 03:21:35.64
We're going to have a PT in the morning.

2531
03:21:35.64 --> 03:21:36.64
We're going to attend mile run.

2532
03:21:36.64 --> 03:21:39.64
So we kind of break out the PT circle and of course,

2533
03:21:39.64 --> 03:21:41.64
it's push up, sit up, sit up, sit all that sort of stuff.

2534
03:21:41.64 --> 03:21:45.64
And I'm struggling to get through the basics because I've got my abs or not back.

2535
03:21:45.64 --> 03:21:46.64
The pelvis is still hurting.

2536
03:21:46.64 --> 03:21:49.64
But I've fake my way through the PT.

2537
03:21:49.64 --> 03:21:50.64
Now we're going to go for the run.

2538
03:21:50.64 --> 03:21:52.64
And I think we went out to,

2539
03:21:52.64 --> 03:21:54.64
we went out to the main point of the Salt Point State Point nut.

2540
03:21:54.64 --> 03:21:56.64
At some point that whatever the State Point nut.

2541
03:21:56.64 --> 03:22:00.64
But we're going to do two five mile loops or something like that.

2542
03:22:00.64 --> 03:22:03.64
So we start off with the run and I hang for all about 100 yards.

2543
03:22:03.64 --> 03:22:04.64
And then everybody just leaves me.

2544
03:22:04.64 --> 03:22:06.64
So but hey, I'm going to do what I can't.

2545
03:22:06.64 --> 03:22:10.64
So I'm kind of walking jogging trying to finish the run.

2546
03:22:10.64 --> 03:22:13.64
Well, few months later, the guy this lead runner,

2547
03:22:13.64 --> 03:22:17.64
you know, he comes around on the first loop of the two mile run.

2548
03:22:17.64 --> 03:22:18.64
And he sees me.

2549
03:22:18.64 --> 03:22:20.64
And of course, at this time, I'm a Navy captain.

2550
03:22:20.64 --> 03:22:23.64
But then for 20, some odd years and he kind of pulls up the side me.

2551
03:22:23.64 --> 03:22:26.64
And he says, so what are you doing?

2552
03:22:26.64 --> 03:22:28.64
I said, what do you mean?

2553
03:22:28.64 --> 03:22:30.64
You go, what are you doing?

2554
03:22:30.64 --> 03:22:33.64
I mean, you're coming off a bad parachute accident.

2555
03:22:33.64 --> 03:22:36.64
He said, you got nothing left to prove.

2556
03:22:36.64 --> 03:22:38.64
And I remember, I thought about that for a long time.

2557
03:22:38.64 --> 03:22:40.64
And he was absolutely wrong.

2558
03:22:40.64 --> 03:22:42.64
And I told these young guys, I said,

2559
03:22:42.64 --> 03:22:49.64
every single day that you wake up and you wear that try and you've got something to prove.

2560
03:22:49.64 --> 03:22:54.64
And if the time comes, that you think you're too senior or too entitled,

2561
03:22:54.64 --> 03:22:57.64
or that you've done it long enough that you don't have anything left to prove,

2562
03:22:57.64 --> 03:23:00.64
you're the wrong guy for the job and you need to leave.

2563
03:23:00.64 --> 03:23:04.64
Because I don't care whether you're an instant or a semen or a forestar animal.

2564
03:23:04.64 --> 03:23:09.64
Every single day you wake up, you got something to prove.

2565
03:23:09.64 --> 03:23:16.64
And if you don't take that attitude, then you're probably not the right person for the job.

2566
03:23:16.64 --> 03:23:22.64
Something I wanted to ask you about because you mentioned it real quick.

2567
03:23:22.64 --> 03:23:29.64
You were talking about, hey, we had a lot of success in we sat here and you and I and I had talking about how great we had been.

2568
03:23:29.64 --> 03:23:33.64
And the special operations community and I talked about,

2569
03:23:33.64 --> 03:23:35.64
I talked about this incredible batting average, right?

2570
03:23:35.64 --> 03:23:36.64
And all that.

2571
03:23:36.64 --> 03:23:41.64
And then you were saying, things always didn't go well.

2572
03:23:41.64 --> 03:23:44.64
When things went bad, you know?

2573
03:23:44.64 --> 03:23:48.64
I've had things go horribly, horribly wrong.

2574
03:23:48.64 --> 03:23:54.64
And, you know, it's one of those things that really stings.

2575
03:23:54.64 --> 03:24:01.64
What do you have any advice or any stories where you remember where something went wrong?

2576
03:24:01.64 --> 03:24:05.64
And you had to own it.

2577
03:24:05.64 --> 03:24:09.64
Yeah, unfortunately, probably way too many stories.

2578
03:24:09.64 --> 03:24:15.64
But the one consistent part of when things go wrong is you got to own it.

2579
03:24:15.64 --> 03:24:18.64
I mean, you have to. You're the person responsible.

2580
03:24:18.64 --> 03:24:22.64
And what you don't want to do is you don't want to say, well, look, I know I'm in charge,

2581
03:24:22.64 --> 03:24:26.64
but it was really the, you know, the young captain of the major or the seal Lieutenant Commander.

2582
03:24:26.64 --> 03:24:28.64
I mean, it's real, no, no, I'm sorry.

2583
03:24:28.64 --> 03:24:30.64
You're the guy in charge.

2584
03:24:30.64 --> 03:24:31.64
You're responsible.

2585
03:24:31.64 --> 03:24:33.64
Now, that doesn't mean you got to get fired every time,

2586
03:24:33.64 --> 03:24:36.64
but that means that you have got to take ownership of the problem.

2587
03:24:36.64 --> 03:24:39.64
You've got to figure out how to make sure that problem doesn't happen again.

2588
03:24:39.64 --> 03:24:44.64
You have to hold the people accountable if the mistakes they made were,

2589
03:24:44.64 --> 03:24:50.64
were mistakes of laziness or of not being moral legal and ethical,

2590
03:24:50.64 --> 03:24:51.64
then you have to hold them accountable.

2591
03:24:51.64 --> 03:24:55.64
And even when they did everything right and they screw up,

2592
03:24:55.64 --> 03:24:56.64
you still have to hold them accountable.

2593
03:24:56.64 --> 03:24:59.64
Doesn't mean you have to fire them, but you have to hold them accountable,

2594
03:24:59.64 --> 03:25:01.64
so that everybody understands, look, we got to standard.

2595
03:25:01.64 --> 03:25:03.64
This is the standard we have to maintain.

2596
03:25:03.64 --> 03:25:06.64
And if you don't live up to the standard, you are going to be held accountable

2597
03:25:06.64 --> 03:25:08.64
because lives are at risk.

2598
03:25:08.64 --> 03:25:12.64
But the first person you have to hold accountable is yourself.

2599
03:25:12.64 --> 03:25:16.64
And so, you know, most of the time, certainly over in combat,

2600
03:25:16.64 --> 03:25:21.64
when things would go wrong, I had to go see the forestar and say,

2601
03:25:21.64 --> 03:25:25.64
this is on me because, you know, and again, this gets back to the Navy mentality,

2602
03:25:25.64 --> 03:25:26.64
as you all know.

2603
03:25:26.64 --> 03:25:30.64
I mean, in the Navy, because the Navy has always had this kind of

2604
03:25:30.64 --> 03:25:34.64
shipboard mentality and for your listeners, you know, when you are the

2605
03:25:34.64 --> 03:25:38.64
commanding officer of a ship, you are responsible for everything that

2606
03:25:38.64 --> 03:25:39.64
happens on that ship.

2607
03:25:39.64 --> 03:25:43.64
And when you pull away from the pier, the commanding officer is king.

2608
03:25:43.64 --> 03:25:47.64
I mean, he is risky or she now is responsible for everything that happens.

2609
03:25:47.64 --> 03:25:51.64
And the Navy understands that look, if you are the commanding officer,

2610
03:25:51.64 --> 03:25:54.64
and your ship runs a ground, and you were asleep in your

2611
03:25:54.64 --> 03:25:57.64
state room, and the young junior officer who was on the helm,

2612
03:25:57.64 --> 03:26:01.64
or was the officer of the deck, failed to wake you up, even though you had

2613
03:26:01.64 --> 03:26:05.64
told them to wake you up, I'm sorry, that's still on you.

2614
03:26:05.64 --> 03:26:09.64
Because you created an atmosphere of fear or something where that

2615
03:26:09.64 --> 03:26:12.64
junior officer didn't feel like he had the latitude to wake you up

2616
03:26:12.64 --> 03:26:14.64
in the middle of a crisis.

2617
03:26:14.64 --> 03:26:17.64
So, you see it happen a lot, and people say, well, why would you hold

2618
03:26:17.64 --> 03:26:20.64
the commanding officer responsible when he left orders for that

2619
03:26:20.64 --> 03:26:24.64
junior officer to wake him up before things got bad?

2620
03:26:24.64 --> 03:26:29.64
And the point of the Navy is this idea, this tradition in the Navy,

2621
03:26:29.64 --> 03:26:32.64
that the commanding officer is responsible because then you didn't train them

2622
03:26:32.64 --> 03:26:36.64
well, then you didn't create the culture for them to do the right thing.

2623
03:26:36.64 --> 03:26:39.64
Something was wrong when you were the commanding officer.

2624
03:26:39.64 --> 03:26:44.64
So, frankly, throughout my time in the Navy, and certainly in the

2625
03:26:44.64 --> 03:26:47.64
special operations community, at the end of the day, it's about me.

2626
03:26:47.64 --> 03:26:51.64
Now, you know, fortunately, you know, your bosses know that when things

2627
03:26:51.64 --> 03:26:55.64
go south, your job is also to correct the problem.

2628
03:26:55.64 --> 03:26:57.64
Sometimes the problem is with you.

2629
03:26:57.64 --> 03:27:00.64
I mean, I think back on a hostage rescue that we had,

2630
03:27:00.64 --> 03:27:02.64
and I'm always careful about telling the story,

2631
03:27:02.64 --> 03:27:05.64
but we had a hostage rescue that did not go well.

2632
03:27:05.64 --> 03:27:08.64
And the hostage ended up getting killed.

2633
03:27:08.64 --> 03:27:13.64
And unfortunately, the guys didn't tell me the truth about the situation.

2634
03:27:13.64 --> 03:27:18.64
But I also looked back on this and realized that some of this was on me.

2635
03:27:18.64 --> 03:27:21.64
Because at the time, as I mentioned, I was kind of bouncing back and forth

2636
03:27:21.64 --> 03:27:24.64
between the Racken FNS stand, and this mission had come up.

2637
03:27:24.64 --> 03:27:28.64
And normally in a hostage rescue situation, I mean, we treated, you know,

2638
03:27:28.64 --> 03:27:32.64
like it is a no kidding national mission, and we are going to do everything

2639
03:27:32.64 --> 03:27:33.64
possible.

2640
03:27:33.64 --> 03:27:37.64
But because we were running so many missions, sometimes in FNS stand,

2641
03:27:37.64 --> 03:27:40.64
it's not that the guys didn't take it seriously,

2642
03:27:40.64 --> 03:27:43.64
but we probably didn't follow all the steps that we normally would have taken

2643
03:27:43.64 --> 03:27:46.64
if this had been a national mission.

2644
03:27:46.64 --> 03:27:51.64
And I think some of that played into why we didn't do the detail planning that would have helped.

2645
03:27:51.64 --> 03:27:53.64
Again, would it have changed the outcome?

2646
03:27:53.64 --> 03:27:54.64
I don't know.

2647
03:27:54.64 --> 03:27:59.64
But I remember thinking afterwards, yeah, the guys in the ground kind of failed

2648
03:27:59.64 --> 03:28:02.64
to do what they probably should have done, and we held them accountable.

2649
03:28:02.64 --> 03:28:04.64
I personally held them accountable.

2650
03:28:04.64 --> 03:28:08.64
But I also kind of had to look myself in the mirror and say, hey, you know,

2651
03:28:08.64 --> 03:28:12.64
at the end of the day, maybe you should have provided better oversight

2652
03:28:12.64 --> 03:28:17.64
and ask harder questions rather than deferring to somebody else to do it.

2653
03:28:17.64 --> 03:28:22.64
So, but here's one other thing I would offer to you.

2654
03:28:22.64 --> 03:28:24.64
Yeah, you're going to make mistakes.

2655
03:28:24.64 --> 03:28:29.64
And the one thing I tell folks that are learning to be leaders is particularly

2656
03:28:29.64 --> 03:28:34.64
in combat, you're going to make mistakes, but you've got to be ready to make the next

2657
03:28:34.64 --> 03:28:35.64
tough decision.

2658
03:28:35.64 --> 03:28:39.64
Because if you were afraid to make the next tough decision,

2659
03:28:39.64 --> 03:28:42.64
when the last mission went bad, then you're not the leader we need you to be.

2660
03:28:42.64 --> 03:28:44.64
Particularly in combat.

2661
03:28:44.64 --> 03:28:46.64
Again, every once in a while I would have a mission that would go south,

2662
03:28:46.64 --> 03:28:48.64
and I knew we could have done things better.

2663
03:28:48.64 --> 03:28:51.64
And I realize now the next mission comes along and you say,

2664
03:28:51.64 --> 03:28:54.64
I don't know, should I do this?

2665
03:28:54.64 --> 03:28:55.64
I do this?

2666
03:28:55.64 --> 03:28:58.64
And if you start to doubt yourself, if you start to question too much,

2667
03:28:58.64 --> 03:29:03.64
if you're afraid to make the tough decisions, then you're putting guys lives at greater risk.

2668
03:29:03.64 --> 03:29:08.64
So, again, you got to learn from those mistakes, you got to do the best you can,

2669
03:29:08.64 --> 03:29:12.64
but as the leader, you got to be prepared to make the next tough decision.

2670
03:29:12.64 --> 03:29:17.64
And if you're not, for fear of failing again, it's time to move on.

2671
03:29:17.64 --> 03:29:21.64
And I always found that when things went south,

2672
03:29:21.64 --> 03:29:24.64
invariably another opportunity would tickly in combat.

2673
03:29:24.64 --> 03:29:26.64
Another opportunity is not far around the corner.

2674
03:29:26.64 --> 03:29:33.64
Okay, now let's put our A game on and you talk about when you're fired.

2675
03:29:33.64 --> 03:29:35.64
Same thing, when a mission goes south,

2676
03:29:35.64 --> 03:29:39.64
and now you know, have another opportunity, and you're doubled down on everything.

2677
03:29:39.64 --> 03:29:43.64
You want to make sure you're doing everything you can to be successful

2678
03:29:43.64 --> 03:29:46.64
and get beyond that bad mission.

2679
03:29:46.64 --> 03:29:48.64
And that's how people progress.

2680
03:29:48.64 --> 03:29:52.64
But yeah, yeah, unfortunately, too many times,

2681
03:29:52.64 --> 03:29:56.64
the things didn't go well.

2682
03:29:56.64 --> 03:30:00.64
But I'd like to think that the ledger shows we had more successes than we had there.

2683
03:30:00.64 --> 03:30:03.64
But I do remember one time on a particular target in a country,

2684
03:30:03.64 --> 03:30:08.64
not a rack in Afghanistan, that I need a permission to take a strike.

2685
03:30:08.64 --> 03:30:14.64
The intelligence said, hey, I had a matter of minutes before the bad guy moved off target.

2686
03:30:14.64 --> 03:30:19.64
So, that's the engineering aims, I get to the forestar,

2687
03:30:19.64 --> 03:30:23.64
and I said, I need permission from the president to take this strike.

2688
03:30:23.64 --> 03:30:28.64
In two minutes, I get permission back from President Obama to take this strike.

2689
03:30:28.64 --> 03:30:32.64
So I take this strike, and it's not the right guy.

2690
03:30:32.64 --> 03:30:35.64
Now, the good news is it was a bad guy.

2691
03:30:35.64 --> 03:30:38.64
The bad news is it was not the guy I thought it was.

2692
03:30:38.64 --> 03:30:43.64
And so now, the White House comes back and says, hey,

2693
03:30:43.64 --> 03:30:47.64
you know, the president made this decision,

2694
03:30:47.64 --> 03:30:50.64
and it didn't pan out the way you'd hope.

2695
03:30:50.64 --> 03:30:53.64
I got it, it was a bad guy, but you know, we were,

2696
03:30:53.64 --> 03:30:57.64
you were getting the president's permission because you said it with this guy.

2697
03:30:57.64 --> 03:30:59.64
So I said, yeah, may I help him?

2698
03:30:59.64 --> 03:31:03.64
And let me explain to you how I came to that decision, and a long story between you

2699
03:31:03.64 --> 03:31:07.64
certain hand held radios don't have the same fidelity, et cetera, et cetera.

2700
03:31:07.64 --> 03:31:13.64
But it forced me to go back and say, okay, I just put the chain of command in a difficult,

2701
03:31:13.64 --> 03:31:16.64
they trusted me, and I let him down.

2702
03:31:16.64 --> 03:31:21.64
I let him down because maybe I rushed it too much, trying to get a win,

2703
03:31:21.64 --> 03:31:24.64
and you have to go back and reassess.

2704
03:31:24.64 --> 03:31:30.64
But the last thing you want to do is put your boss in a situation where they trusted you

2705
03:31:30.64 --> 03:31:32.64
and you let him down.

2706
03:31:32.64 --> 03:31:36.64
I mean, I had one mission that went south, and I remember my boss,

2707
03:31:36.64 --> 03:31:38.64
yeah, you don't mind getting wire brushed.

2708
03:31:38.64 --> 03:31:44.64
Yeah, when you're, so wire brushed me, yeah, when somebody calls you up and just rips you apart,

2709
03:31:44.64 --> 03:31:46.64
you know, I got used to that.

2710
03:31:46.64 --> 03:31:48.64
I mean, combat that happens.

2711
03:31:48.64 --> 03:31:52.64
But I remember one point in time, I had a mission to kind of go south and the,

2712
03:31:52.64 --> 03:31:56.64
and the, and the forestar, when I had him on the phone, I was just playing things you got as Bill.

2713
03:31:56.64 --> 03:32:01.64
I am really disappointed in you and your men and man.

2714
03:32:01.64 --> 03:32:04.64
Yeah, that's a knife and the hearts sort of thing.

2715
03:32:04.64 --> 03:32:06.64
And he had a right to be.

2716
03:32:06.64 --> 03:32:11.64
But we're cleaning that, got back to business, and then I remember a couple years later,

2717
03:32:11.64 --> 03:32:16.64
you know, I were having lunch, and he said, do you remember that incident?

2718
03:32:16.64 --> 03:32:17.64
Oh, yes, sir.

2719
03:32:17.64 --> 03:32:19.64
I do remember that incident.

2720
03:32:19.64 --> 03:32:23.64
You know, as you covered really, you recovered very well, and you did a great job,

2721
03:32:23.64 --> 03:32:26.64
and then again, that's, that's what you watch your bosses to say,

2722
03:32:26.64 --> 03:32:29.64
that they appreciate the work you do.

2723
03:32:29.64 --> 03:32:37.64
Well, and the bull frog for three years, and, and in, what was it?

2724
03:32:37.64 --> 03:32:42.64
You actually did the commencement speech at the University of Texas before you retired.

2725
03:32:42.64 --> 03:32:43.64
I did.

2726
03:32:43.64 --> 03:32:44.64
Yeah.

2727
03:32:44.64 --> 03:32:52.64
I was about to say, you're a shining example of the, of the fact that the zero defect attitude is wrong,

2728
03:32:52.64 --> 03:32:57.64
right? You know, you have that zero defect attitude of, hey, if someone fails one time,

2729
03:32:57.64 --> 03:33:01.64
get rid of them or if someone makes a mistake or if they're not perfect, get rid of them.

2730
03:33:01.64 --> 03:33:03.64
We've all do respect, sir.

2731
03:33:03.64 --> 03:33:08.64
You are an outstanding example of, you know, someone that's someone that's, you know,

2732
03:33:08.64 --> 03:33:11.64
but I don't want to say you had plenty of defects along the way.

2733
03:33:11.64 --> 03:33:15.64
But I fear mistakes, but there certainly are, I mean, just so people understand,

2734
03:33:15.64 --> 03:33:19.64
you know, when you get fired from a position as a naval officer, that can be,

2735
03:33:19.64 --> 03:33:21.64
that, that oftentimes the end of your career.

2736
03:33:21.64 --> 03:33:22.64
Right.

2737
03:33:22.64 --> 03:33:25.64
So you can get you going on for a couple more years, but that can be the end of your career.

2738
03:33:25.64 --> 03:33:26.64
Yeah.

2739
03:33:26.64 --> 03:33:30.64
I mean, I was blessed with it in great people who gave me a second chance.

2740
03:33:30.64 --> 03:33:33.64
And, you know, I said earlier, I think, you know,

2741
03:33:33.64 --> 03:33:36.64
once a while, we all need second chances.

2742
03:33:36.64 --> 03:33:39.64
And again, I was fortunate in my career a number of times.

2743
03:33:39.64 --> 03:33:44.64
I remember we had one particular mission where I went across the border into Pakistan.

2744
03:33:44.64 --> 03:33:47.64
And it was my first mission actually as a J. Sacramento.

2745
03:33:47.64 --> 03:33:50.64
And without going to the two-by-step detail, bad guys,

2746
03:33:50.64 --> 03:33:54.64
we've been looking at this target for a long time.

2747
03:33:54.64 --> 03:33:57.64
And my first mission as the commander.

2748
03:33:57.64 --> 03:33:59.64
And I, I mean, I've rolled the dice.

2749
03:33:59.64 --> 03:34:02.64
I've always been a bit of a risk taker.

2750
03:34:02.64 --> 03:34:04.64
So we wanted to go get this target.

2751
03:34:04.64 --> 03:34:07.64
So we go in and the guys kind of get compromised.

2752
03:34:07.64 --> 03:34:11.64
Just as they're coming onto the target, gun battle ensues.

2753
03:34:11.64 --> 03:34:16.64
Bad guys get killed, but we wanted to capture them because we knew they had intel.

2754
03:34:16.64 --> 03:34:18.64
And anyway, the mission does not go well.

2755
03:34:18.64 --> 03:34:23.64
So I come back and, so now I've got a report back to my boss who was General Marty Dimsey,

2756
03:34:23.64 --> 03:34:25.64
who was a sent-com commander at the time.

2757
03:34:25.64 --> 03:34:30.64
So I called him up and I said, he's here's what happened.

2758
03:34:30.64 --> 03:34:33.64
And obviously I'm not too happy about a counter-math through.

2759
03:34:33.64 --> 03:34:36.64
And he says, okay, Bill, okay, fine.

2760
03:34:36.64 --> 03:34:38.64
So hang on, hang on with phone.

2761
03:34:38.64 --> 03:34:40.64
Few months later, phone rings.

2762
03:34:40.64 --> 03:34:44.64
His general Dimsey on the phone. He says, hey, Bill, you sounded a little down.

2763
03:34:44.64 --> 03:34:46.64
So, yes, sir.

2764
03:34:46.64 --> 03:34:50.64
So, you know, the mission didn't go as planned.

2765
03:34:50.64 --> 03:34:52.64
He goes, it's okay, man.

2766
03:34:52.64 --> 03:34:54.64
I mean, missions are not always going to go as planned.

2767
03:34:54.64 --> 03:34:56.64
And you know, you made all the right decisions,

2768
03:34:56.64 --> 03:34:59.64
but as we all know, the enemy gets a vote sometimes.

2769
03:34:59.64 --> 03:35:01.64
He said, don't, don't let this shake you.

2770
03:35:01.64 --> 03:35:03.64
You just keep doing what you're doing.

2771
03:35:03.64 --> 03:35:06.64
I tell you that. My first mission is the J. Sacramento.

2772
03:35:06.64 --> 03:35:08.64
And when the sent-com commander has your back,

2773
03:35:08.64 --> 03:35:11.64
like General Dimsey did, I mean, that's when you,

2774
03:35:11.64 --> 03:35:14.64
except you need people up the chain of command that

2775
03:35:14.64 --> 03:35:17.64
believe in you even when things don't go well.

2776
03:35:17.64 --> 03:35:19.64
And I always hope that when I was in command,

2777
03:35:19.64 --> 03:35:22.64
and officers below me struggled sometimes,

2778
03:35:22.64 --> 03:35:26.64
I would take the officers analyst that I'd take the time to go down and say,

2779
03:35:26.64 --> 03:35:30.64
it's okay, you know, things don't always go well.

2780
03:35:30.64 --> 03:35:32.64
Get back up on the horse and let's keep moving.

2781
03:35:32.64 --> 03:35:34.64
If you got confidence in these guys,

2782
03:35:34.64 --> 03:35:36.64
now again, there's some guys you just got to say,

2783
03:35:36.64 --> 03:35:38.64
you know what, you weren't meant to be in this position.

2784
03:35:38.64 --> 03:35:41.64
And I had, you got, I had to fire a few people too.

2785
03:35:41.64 --> 03:35:44.64
And some of them, you know, as good as they might have been in training,

2786
03:35:44.64 --> 03:35:46.64
when it came time for combat,

2787
03:35:46.64 --> 03:35:49.64
it just wasn't, they weren't right for it.

2788
03:35:49.64 --> 03:35:52.64
And then you had to move them on as graciously as you could

2789
03:35:52.64 --> 03:35:55.64
if they, if they weren't the right guy for the job.

2790
03:35:55.64 --> 03:35:57.64
But again, I was blessed throughout my career to have people

2791
03:35:57.64 --> 03:36:01.64
that had confidence in me and continue to give me second chances

2792
03:36:01.64 --> 03:36:04.64
and put me in position to be successful.

2793
03:36:04.64 --> 03:36:07.64
Early on in my last deployment to Ramadi,

2794
03:36:07.64 --> 03:36:10.64
I had a blue arm blue, I had a fractur side take place

2795
03:36:10.64 --> 03:36:13.64
and, you know, it's a freaking complete nut or nightmare.

2796
03:36:13.64 --> 03:36:17.64
And from the Iraqi soldier got killed, one of my guys got wounded

2797
03:36:17.64 --> 03:36:20.64
several other friendly Iraqis got wounded.

2798
03:36:20.64 --> 03:36:26.64
And the army, the army working in Ramadi,

2799
03:36:26.64 --> 03:36:29.64
was kind of like, hey, you know, like, it happens almost.

2800
03:36:29.64 --> 03:36:34.64
But that's not a very special operation's attitude, you know,

2801
03:36:34.64 --> 03:36:36.64
at all.

2802
03:36:36.64 --> 03:36:40.64
Van Hoesier happened to be coming through country at the time.

2803
03:36:40.64 --> 03:36:45.64
And he happened to stop by shark base at the time,

2804
03:36:45.64 --> 03:36:47.64
which was my little basin.

2805
03:36:47.64 --> 03:36:50.64
And, you know, he was a marine Vietnam man.

2806
03:36:50.64 --> 03:36:54.64
And he said, hey, Jocca, I wasn't way city.

2807
03:36:54.64 --> 03:36:56.64
And he goes, and I wasn't, he goes, I didn't fight in way city,

2808
03:36:56.64 --> 03:36:59.64
but I was there afterwards.

2809
03:36:59.64 --> 03:37:02.64
And it's urban combat, and this shit is hard.

2810
03:37:02.64 --> 03:37:07.64
And I forget the percentage, but it was a mass of third of the casualties

2811
03:37:07.64 --> 03:37:10.64
in way city, we're friendly fire.

2812
03:37:10.64 --> 03:37:13.64
You know, it's going to happen, square you shit away,

2813
03:37:13.64 --> 03:37:16.64
fix your chicken and you move on.

2814
03:37:16.64 --> 03:37:20.64
And that was to me, okay, okay, this is,

2815
03:37:20.64 --> 03:37:22.64
I'm not the worst loser in the world,

2816
03:37:22.64 --> 03:37:25.64
which I absolutely felt like, it's freaking horrible.

2817
03:37:25.64 --> 03:37:29.64
And then, you know, a few months later,

2818
03:37:29.64 --> 03:37:31.64
Mark Lee is a first seal killed in Iraq.

2819
03:37:31.64 --> 03:37:37.64
And, you know, I'm again, just heartbroken and crushed.

2820
03:37:37.64 --> 03:37:40.64
And Admiral Mowire, who I, you know,

2821
03:37:40.64 --> 03:37:44.64
was his aide for 13 months and called me up, you know,

2822
03:37:44.64 --> 03:37:48.64
and said, hey, you got to get back out there.

2823
03:37:48.64 --> 03:37:49.64
You're doing the right thing.

2824
03:37:49.64 --> 03:37:52.64
And that kind of support from these senior leaders at that time.

2825
03:37:52.64 --> 03:37:55.64
You know, it's a very similar situation for me.

2826
03:37:55.64 --> 03:38:03.64
But, you know, it's real easy to real easy to pile on, right?

2827
03:38:03.64 --> 03:38:06.64
To say, oh, you had a blue on blue,

2828
03:38:06.64 --> 03:38:08.64
what the hell's wrong with you?

2829
03:38:08.64 --> 03:38:09.64
Real easy to do that.

2830
03:38:09.64 --> 03:38:10.64
It's really so you lost a guy.

2831
03:38:10.64 --> 03:38:11.64
What are you guys doing?

2832
03:38:11.64 --> 03:38:14.64
Real easy to take that approach and both those guys, you know,

2833
03:38:14.64 --> 03:38:18.64
just took the approach of actually understanding what we were going through.

2834
03:38:18.64 --> 03:38:21.64
Hey, man, there's, we're, we're getting in firefight.

2835
03:38:21.64 --> 03:38:24.64
Every single day here, you think we're going to make it through a six month appointment

2836
03:38:24.64 --> 03:38:26.64
and not taking the casualties like that's,

2837
03:38:26.64 --> 03:38:29.64
I don't even know, I don't even know why I would think that.

2838
03:38:29.64 --> 03:38:31.64
Like, it's a crazy thought.

2839
03:38:31.64 --> 03:38:34.64
But another good leadership lesson and it's just, you know,

2840
03:38:34.64 --> 03:38:36.64
hey, people are going to have things happen.

2841
03:38:36.64 --> 03:38:37.64
People are going to make mistakes.

2842
03:38:37.64 --> 03:38:39.64
Things are going to go wrong.

2843
03:38:39.64 --> 03:38:40.64
What are you going to do?

2844
03:38:40.64 --> 03:38:43.64
You're going to pile on, especially somebody that's already

2845
03:38:43.64 --> 03:38:45.64
freaking tearing themselves up.

2846
03:38:45.64 --> 03:38:47.64
You're going to pile on and I had to do the same thing, you know,

2847
03:38:47.64 --> 03:38:49.64
with, with platoon commanders, you know,

2848
03:38:49.64 --> 03:38:52.64
late babinem, and he's, he's calling me up.

2849
03:38:52.64 --> 03:38:55.64
You know, it's another, he's calling me up.

2850
03:38:55.64 --> 03:38:57.64
Hey, we just, you know, guy got shot, Ryan Job shot.

2851
03:38:57.64 --> 03:38:58.64
He's hit bad.

2852
03:38:58.64 --> 03:38:59.64
I don't know if he's going to live.

2853
03:38:59.64 --> 03:39:01.64
The army's in a gunfight right now, Jocco.

2854
03:39:01.64 --> 03:39:03.64
We need to go help him.

2855
03:39:03.64 --> 03:39:05.64
And I'm like execute, you know, don't,

2856
03:39:05.64 --> 03:39:07.64
didn't run it up the chain.

2857
03:39:07.64 --> 03:39:11.64
The armies were side by side with these guys and he ends up losing Mark.

2858
03:39:11.64 --> 03:39:15.64
You know, it's like, are we going to pile on these guys?

2859
03:39:15.64 --> 03:39:17.64
Are we going to support, they're making a freaking hard decision

2860
03:39:17.64 --> 03:39:19.64
to make an at best possible decision they can make at the time?

2861
03:39:19.64 --> 03:39:21.64
And that's what we have to do.

2862
03:39:21.64 --> 03:39:23.64
Yeah.

2863
03:39:23.64 --> 03:39:29.64
And your point about decision making is a good one because the nature of combat in and to some degree

2864
03:39:29.64 --> 03:39:33.64
of the nature even prior to combat and training, you see it, but more so in combat because to your point,

2865
03:39:33.64 --> 03:39:37.64
you're having to make hard decisions all day long.

2866
03:39:37.64 --> 03:39:39.64
You're just not going to get all those decisions right.

2867
03:39:39.64 --> 03:39:43.64
When I, when I became the chancellor of the University of Texas system,

2868
03:39:43.64 --> 03:39:45.64
I'm in charge of 14 institutions, very large institution,

2869
03:39:45.64 --> 03:39:47.64
university tech, it's at Austin,

2870
03:39:47.64 --> 03:39:49.64
I'm the Anderson Cancer Clinic.

2871
03:39:49.64 --> 03:39:51.64
And I've often said, you know, in the states today,

2872
03:39:51.64 --> 03:39:55.64
some of the hardest jobs in the world are being the presence of institutions like that

2873
03:39:55.64 --> 03:40:01.64
because they've got students, they've got faculty, they've got donors, they've got, you know, all these sorts of things.

2874
03:40:01.64 --> 03:40:05.64
But everyone's in a while there were people outside the system that,

2875
03:40:05.64 --> 03:40:07.64
well why did the president make that decision?

2876
03:40:07.64 --> 03:40:09.64
Why would he do something like that? Why would she do that?

2877
03:40:09.64 --> 03:40:13.64
And I have to say, you know, they make a thousand decisions a day.

2878
03:40:13.64 --> 03:40:17.64
999 of them, you don't see because they were good decisions.

2879
03:40:17.64 --> 03:40:21.64
And now you're going to get on them because they made one bad decision.

2880
03:40:21.64 --> 03:40:27.64
I got this. You, you, you, thank you very much for your input,

2881
03:40:27.64 --> 03:40:29.64
but you know, and I would tell the president,

2882
03:40:29.64 --> 03:40:33.64
look, I've got it. I haven't been the president of the University before,

2883
03:40:33.64 --> 03:40:35.64
but I've been in charge of things. It's okay.

2884
03:40:35.64 --> 03:40:37.64
Do the best you can. You're going to make mistakes.

2885
03:40:37.64 --> 03:40:41.64
I got you back. And, but, you know, if you make serious mistake,

2886
03:40:41.64 --> 03:40:45.64
you're going to hold your countable. Yeah. And if you, if you're a repeat offender,

2887
03:40:45.64 --> 03:40:47.64
that means you're probably not capable of doing the job.

2888
03:40:47.64 --> 03:40:49.64
And so I'm going to fire you and that's the way it works.

2889
03:40:49.64 --> 03:40:53.64
So you, you end up retiring after 37 years.

2890
03:40:53.64 --> 03:40:57.64
I guess there was no really else for you to go.

2891
03:40:57.64 --> 03:40:59.64
I mean, the career worked out okay.

2892
03:40:59.64 --> 03:41:03.64
And, and then you, you'd given that commencement speech,

2893
03:41:03.64 --> 03:41:05.64
which is, I guess this,

2894
03:41:05.64 --> 03:41:07.64
I have to check with echo Charles, my kind of,

2895
03:41:07.64 --> 03:41:09.64
what is it, pop culture guy?

2896
03:41:09.64 --> 03:41:11.64
Yes.

2897
03:41:11.64 --> 03:41:13.64
Was it safe to say that's a viral speech?

2898
03:41:13.64 --> 03:41:15.64
Fire, okay.

2899
03:41:15.64 --> 03:41:17.64
So maybe even iconic.

2900
03:41:17.64 --> 03:41:18.64
Oh, iconic.

2901
03:41:18.64 --> 03:41:21.64
You give the iconic make your bed speech.

2902
03:41:21.64 --> 03:41:25.64
Did you know you, what point did you figure out you're going to be the Chancellor there?

2903
03:41:25.64 --> 03:41:29.64
Yeah. So they had approached me in April about the job.

2904
03:41:29.64 --> 03:41:33.64
And, and frankly, initially, I set a what, and interested.

2905
03:41:33.64 --> 03:41:35.64
I mean, I was coming off, you know, 37 years.

2906
03:41:35.64 --> 03:41:37.64
I was really kind of ready for a break.

2907
03:41:37.64 --> 03:41:41.64
And, and I knew being the Chancellor was another, you know, stepping into a, you know,

2908
03:41:41.64 --> 03:41:43.64
365 to a year or sort of job.

2909
03:41:43.64 --> 03:41:46.64
But, I mean, my wife and I would talk about it.

2910
03:41:46.64 --> 03:41:49.64
And she said, okay, look, if you could do anything else,

2911
03:41:49.64 --> 03:41:51.64
because I got asked to be CEOs of this, and then,

2912
03:41:51.64 --> 03:41:53.64
as if you could do anything else.

2913
03:41:53.64 --> 03:41:55.64
What would you rather do when I thought,

2914
03:41:55.64 --> 03:41:56.64
yeah, I don't know.

2915
03:41:56.64 --> 03:41:58.64
This actually sounds like pretty good yet.

2916
03:41:58.64 --> 03:42:02.64
So I'm, I've got to have a, you know, I've got to have great students that kind of like my troops.

2917
03:42:02.64 --> 03:42:05.64
I'm going to have football team and a baseball team,

2918
03:42:05.64 --> 03:42:07.64
and I'll get the travel around.

2919
03:42:07.64 --> 03:42:10.64
I mean, it was essentially the same sort of leadership dynamics of being the so-comment of the J.

2920
03:42:10.64 --> 03:42:12.64
Jay Saw Commander.

2921
03:42:12.64 --> 03:42:16.64
I mean, again, you had faculty and students and issues you had to deal with,

2922
03:42:16.64 --> 03:42:18.64
and I had subordinate commanders.

2923
03:42:18.64 --> 03:42:20.64
And so it turned out to be a great job.

2924
03:42:20.64 --> 03:42:22.64
But that was an April.

2925
03:42:22.64 --> 03:42:26.64
And then I give the speech in May.

2926
03:42:26.64 --> 03:42:30.64
But it wasn't until, so the speech to your point.

2927
03:42:30.64 --> 03:42:32.64
I mean, it, it, it gets a lot of traction.

2928
03:42:32.64 --> 03:42:37.64
And then, and it was about June, I decided, you know, I think this is going to be a good,

2929
03:42:37.64 --> 03:42:38.64
good job for me.

2930
03:42:38.64 --> 03:42:40.64
So we agreed to do it.

2931
03:42:40.64 --> 03:42:45.64
And I think sometimes in July, they kind of anointed me and then I took over in January.

2932
03:42:45.64 --> 03:42:50.64
You, you like brushed over the fact earlier that you got diagnosed with cancer,

2933
03:42:50.64 --> 03:42:53.64
you know, and, and in the book, you talk about kind of what that,

2934
03:42:53.64 --> 03:42:56.64
or one of the books you talk about, what that experience was like.

2935
03:42:56.64 --> 03:43:01.64
And, and it seemed like it's, it was something that you could kind of suppress for a while.

2936
03:43:01.64 --> 03:43:05.64
But it ended up, when in 2017 kind of catching up with you a bit.

2937
03:43:05.64 --> 03:43:06.64
Yeah, Dad.

2938
03:43:06.64 --> 03:43:10.64
So chronic lymphocetic leukemia, I mean, the good news is it's a chronic cancer.

2939
03:43:10.64 --> 03:43:12.64
So it is manageable to a degree.

2940
03:43:12.64 --> 03:43:18.64
But, you know, for years prior to 2010, every time I get a physical,

2941
03:43:18.64 --> 03:43:21.64
the doctors would say, well, you know, you're anemic.

2942
03:43:21.64 --> 03:43:24.64
Now, let's say, I'm sorry about that.

2943
03:43:24.64 --> 03:43:26.64
And yeah, I got a job, do what I do.

2944
03:43:26.64 --> 03:43:30.64
And I say, well, take, eat more protein, take the Zyron tablets or something.

2945
03:43:30.64 --> 03:43:39.64
And then in 2010, Dr. Diagnosed, they did a bone marrow biopsie,

2946
03:43:39.64 --> 03:43:41.64
and they came back to all the IIT CLL.

2947
03:43:41.64 --> 03:43:44.64
And I, but I remember the doctors were more concerned about the neemia.

2948
03:43:44.64 --> 03:43:46.64
They said, how do you get up in the morning?

2949
03:43:46.64 --> 03:43:49.64
I know, I get up, I drank a couple of rippets, you know,

2950
03:43:49.64 --> 03:43:53.64
I energy drinks, I got a work, and because what was happening

2951
03:43:53.64 --> 03:43:56.64
was my body was storing the iron in the bone marrow,

2952
03:43:56.64 --> 03:43:58.64
but it wasn't moving the iron.

2953
03:43:58.64 --> 03:44:04.64
So long runs, you know, you just weren't getting the oxygen into the system.

2954
03:44:04.64 --> 03:44:08.64
But, I'm sorry, you got a job to do, you know, you get up and do.

2955
03:44:08.64 --> 03:44:12.64
And so, and then when I became chancellor, I could tell that it was,

2956
03:44:12.64 --> 03:44:16.64
it was starting to get more problematic.

2957
03:44:16.64 --> 03:44:20.64
I was just finding days, I had trouble getting up off the couch, you know.

2958
03:44:20.64 --> 03:44:22.64
And, but again, you had a job to do.

2959
03:44:22.64 --> 03:44:25.64
So you get up and you go do it, you power through it.

2960
03:44:25.64 --> 03:44:28.64
Finally, in 2017, it just kind of perfect storm.

2961
03:44:28.64 --> 03:44:30.64
I'd had a little bit of a virus.

2962
03:44:30.64 --> 03:44:33.64
The anemia was at its peak.

2963
03:44:33.64 --> 03:44:37.64
And my doctor who had diagnosed me in 2010, great guy named Michael Keating,

2964
03:44:37.64 --> 03:44:41.64
who really kind of, I talk about it in the hero code.

2965
03:44:41.64 --> 03:44:44.64
You know, you go in there, you're scared, you know, thinking that, you know,

2966
03:44:44.64 --> 03:44:48.64
my career is over, maybe my life's over, and then not through this in future

2967
03:44:48.64 --> 03:44:51.64
and he said, hey, don't you worry about it.

2968
03:44:51.64 --> 03:44:52.64
We got this, you're going to be fine.

2969
03:44:52.64 --> 03:44:56.64
And of course, first question I asked is, can I go back to Afghanistan?

2970
03:44:56.64 --> 03:45:00.64
My wife was like, really? That's your first question.

2971
03:45:00.64 --> 03:45:05.64
But so, you know, I was able to kind of continue on, but finally in 2017, it caught up.

2972
03:45:05.64 --> 03:45:08.64
I got some therapy at MD Anderson.

2973
03:45:08.64 --> 03:45:10.64
Like, pop me full of chemicals.

2974
03:45:10.64 --> 03:45:14.64
And I mean, a month later, all my numbers were good, and I've been, you know,

2975
03:45:14.64 --> 03:45:17.64
not going wood, been feeling good, so ever since then.

2976
03:45:17.64 --> 03:45:19.64
When do you retire from the chancellor job?

2977
03:45:19.64 --> 03:45:22.64
In 2018, summer of 2018.

2978
03:45:22.64 --> 03:45:25.64
And when did C-Stories come out?

2979
03:45:25.64 --> 03:45:27.64
All right, I'll check.

2980
03:45:27.64 --> 03:45:28.64
Yeah, but I'll check.

2981
03:45:28.64 --> 03:45:29.64
That's sure.

2982
03:45:29.64 --> 03:45:30.64
Twenty-nine.

2983
03:45:30.64 --> 03:45:31.64
Twenty-nine, maybe.

2984
03:45:31.64 --> 03:45:33.64
So, also, it's after your tired.

2985
03:45:33.64 --> 03:45:34.64
After your tired.

2986
03:45:34.64 --> 03:45:35.64
Yeah, okay.

2987
03:45:35.64 --> 03:45:36.64
That's a good one.

2988
03:45:36.64 --> 03:45:39.64
So, make your bed was the first one, and that was, I think, when I was still the chancellor.

2989
03:45:39.64 --> 03:45:43.64
Yeah, C-Stories was maybe 2019, and then, the hero code just came out.

2990
03:45:43.64 --> 03:45:47.64
And so, hero code, the latest one, before we close out,

2991
03:45:47.64 --> 03:45:50.64
what brought about the hero code?

2992
03:45:50.64 --> 03:45:54.64
You know, I think it really kind of came back to make your bed.

2993
03:45:54.64 --> 03:45:56.64
I mean, I'm always just like hero, I joke.

2994
03:45:56.64 --> 03:46:00.64
You know, people are always asking me, you know, kind of give us more lessons.

2995
03:46:00.64 --> 03:46:01.64
That sort of thing.

2996
03:46:01.64 --> 03:46:05.64
But people were asking me, okay, tell me who your heroes are.

2997
03:46:05.64 --> 03:46:08.64
And the hero code, it's not about me.

2998
03:46:08.64 --> 03:46:12.64
I mean, it's through my eyes, but it's about people that I met or encountered along the way.

2999
03:46:12.64 --> 03:46:16.64
And it is about the qualities that they had.

3000
03:46:16.64 --> 03:46:22.64
And I actually, when I first started that, I thought, you know, what is a hero?

3001
03:46:22.64 --> 03:46:26.64
I mean, we kind of intuitively know what a hero is, but I pulled up the textbook definition.

3002
03:46:26.64 --> 03:46:28.64
And it was actually pretty good.

3003
03:46:28.64 --> 03:46:34.64
The textbook definition says a hero is someone we admire for their noble qualities.

3004
03:46:34.64 --> 03:46:37.64
And I like this idea of their noble qualities.

3005
03:46:37.64 --> 03:46:43.64
They're in their perfect, but they have noble qualities, certainly at a point in time when they need them.

3006
03:46:43.64 --> 03:46:52.64
So the first story is about courage. And Winston Churchill said something like, you know, courage is the most important of all qualities because it guarantees all the rest.

3007
03:46:52.64 --> 03:46:55.64
So, you know, you're not going to have anything else unless you first have courage.

3008
03:46:55.64 --> 03:47:01.64
And the first story is about actually why he was, unfortunately, killed in Afghanistan and her remarkable courage.

3009
03:47:01.64 --> 03:47:11.64
But I go through the book with these, these stories of these people that I think had the right qualities, the courage and humility and sacrifice and perseverance and the sense of duty.

3010
03:47:11.64 --> 03:47:14.64
And you read a little bit on the sense of humor.

3011
03:47:14.64 --> 03:47:22.64
I mean, frankly, and I tell the story about being at UDT-11, but of course, I saw that sense of humor in the hospitals.

3012
03:47:22.64 --> 03:47:28.64
And this is when it really resonated with me. Back to the, the infantryman who said, you know, you should have seen the other guy.

3013
03:47:28.64 --> 03:47:34.64
I mean, how many times did I give some guy, you know, good nature of banning you said, man, you look like shit.

3014
03:47:34.64 --> 03:47:37.64
That was always the standard comeback. You should see the other guy.

3015
03:47:37.64 --> 03:47:44.64
And of course, that was their way of saying, hey, I may have lost an armor leg, but they haven't beaten me. I can still laugh about this.

3016
03:47:44.64 --> 03:47:52.64
And so, you know, and then the last one is on forgiveness. And you talk about, you know, what missions went south? Well, this was when they went really south on us.

3017
03:47:52.64 --> 03:47:56.64
And it was a, we were going after a bad guy in Gardez.

3018
03:47:56.64 --> 03:48:00.64
Had some soldiers on target. We thought the bad guy was in the compound.

3019
03:48:00.64 --> 03:48:07.64
Guys got up on the walls, snipers looking down in. Somebody comes out with an AK-47. He gets shot.

3020
03:48:07.64 --> 03:48:18.64
Another guy in a doorway picks up an AK-47. The, the soldier automatic weapon shoots him, but in shooting him rounds go through him.

3021
03:48:18.64 --> 03:48:21.64
And unbuttoned, it's killed a number of women on the other side.

3022
03:48:21.64 --> 03:48:29.64
And so, when the action dies down, they get on target. They can't figure out why the, the women by the time we get in there, they are bound.

3023
03:48:29.64 --> 03:48:40.64
And, and so, frankly, initially, we thought maybe it was on her killing. But of course, we didn't, it sounds crazy, but we just didn't understand the time that, you know, they bound him up so that they, the jaws didn't open and other things.

3024
03:48:40.64 --> 03:48:45.64
And so, it took us a while to really understand what was going on. But then what we realized is we did the investigation was,

3025
03:48:45.64 --> 03:48:50.64
a, one, the two guys with the AK-47 turned out to be FNM policeman.

3026
03:48:50.64 --> 03:48:56.64
And the women were in a sit-by standards that we had unfortunately killed. I mean, it was the, it was the war of all my time.

3027
03:48:56.64 --> 03:49:06.64
And it was the worst, you know, kind of civilian casualty incident that I'd seen. And we'd had some bad ones, but none quite as bad as that.

3028
03:49:06.64 --> 03:49:11.64
And I realized, yeah, during the day, I mean, it's back on me.

3029
03:49:11.64 --> 03:49:20.64
So, I went down to apologize to the father. And I remember, I linked up with some Afghan soldiers and one of their army guy.

3030
03:49:20.64 --> 03:49:27.64
And we went into the town in Guard Dess, and of course, there are hundreds of angry Afghans.

3031
03:49:27.64 --> 03:49:35.64
But you got an obligation. And so I sat down in this city hall for like a better term, was about 200 Afghans seated there.

3032
03:49:35.64 --> 03:49:44.64
And I apologize to the father. And I remember before I did it, I talked to my Afghan counterpart, General Salim.

3033
03:49:44.64 --> 03:49:52.64
And I said, what do I say to this guy? I mean, we killed his sons and a daughter. What do you say to a guy like that?

3034
03:49:52.64 --> 03:49:57.64
And Salim looked at me and he kind of cocked a setting, he said, oh, he will forgive you.

3035
03:49:57.64 --> 03:50:01.64
I said, so I don't know. He goes, oh, no, he will forgive you.

3036
03:50:01.64 --> 03:50:06.64
I said, well, with all the respect, Salim, and he said, he's a good Muslim. He will forgive you.

3037
03:50:06.64 --> 03:50:14.64
And he said, look, he said, think about forgiveness is it not only relieves your burden.

3038
03:50:14.64 --> 03:50:19.64
It will relieve his burden as well. It will take away his anger.

3039
03:50:19.64 --> 03:50:24.64
And it will, if he forgives you. And I thought, man, that's a stretch.

3040
03:50:24.64 --> 03:50:27.64
But I got there and sat down with the father and I apologize to him.

3041
03:50:27.64 --> 03:50:31.64
And I can see the look in his eye and they forgave me.

3042
03:50:31.64 --> 03:50:38.64
And this idea forgives particularly today. You know, it seems like everybody today gets easily offended.

3043
03:50:38.64 --> 03:50:43.64
You know, everybody gets slided and they want to hold on to that anger.

3044
03:50:43.64 --> 03:50:51.64
They don't want to forgive people for whatever that slight was because the anger empowers them to be mad.

3045
03:50:51.64 --> 03:50:54.64
It empowers them to fight back.

3046
03:50:54.64 --> 03:50:58.64
And they feel like if they let that anger go, if they forgive that individual,

3047
03:50:58.64 --> 03:51:01.64
then they don't get to be the person that holds the power.

3048
03:51:01.64 --> 03:51:05.64
And I think that's just absolutely the wrong way to approach it.

3049
03:51:05.64 --> 03:51:07.64
I mean, the whole thing about forgiveness.

3050
03:51:07.64 --> 03:51:13.64
So I tell the story about there about the white supremac still in roof that killed all the people at the Baptist Church.

3051
03:51:13.64 --> 03:51:18.64
And the families went up one by one and said, I forgive you.

3052
03:51:18.64 --> 03:51:19.64
I forgive you.

3053
03:51:19.64 --> 03:51:23.64
And the point was they were not going to, they were not going to hold on to that anger.

3054
03:51:23.64 --> 03:51:25.64
They were not going to kind of bear that burden.

3055
03:51:25.64 --> 03:51:30.64
So today as we look at society and we wonder why everybody gets so offended.

3056
03:51:30.64 --> 03:51:35.64
I mean, I would offer take the opportunity to try to forgive the people that offend you.

3057
03:51:35.64 --> 03:51:38.64
I mean, some of them are bigger fences, some of them are little ones.

3058
03:51:38.64 --> 03:51:44.64
But I think as a society, we can do a little better than every single slide, every single, you know,

3059
03:51:44.64 --> 03:51:48.64
misstep somebody takes, you don't have to hold on to that anger.

3060
03:51:48.64 --> 03:51:51.64
You don't have to fight back. You can forgive people.

3061
03:51:51.64 --> 03:51:55.64
Well, it takes a lot more strength to forgive someone than it does to hold a grudge.

3062
03:51:55.64 --> 03:51:57.64
It absolutely does.

3063
03:51:57.64 --> 03:52:10.64
I often worry to worry because, you know, sometimes we have whole sections of society or countries or people that that have a grudge.

3064
03:52:10.64 --> 03:52:13.64
And you know, I look at it as two parts.

3065
03:52:13.64 --> 03:52:17.64
Like you need one side needs to say, I'm sorry, the other side needs to forgive.

3066
03:52:17.64 --> 03:52:22.64
And it's very difficult to get to human beings, just just two human beings to do that.

3067
03:52:22.64 --> 03:52:29.64
And when you have, you know, a collective lot of grievances from two different opposing sides,

3068
03:52:29.64 --> 03:52:33.64
we have a hard time making that progress.

3069
03:52:33.64 --> 03:52:38.64
That's the latest book, the hero code.

3070
03:52:38.64 --> 03:52:46.64
And as you and I were talking as we, as we start off, I've written these kids books and the kids books

3071
03:52:46.64 --> 03:52:51.64
have a code, the warrior kid code. And I mean, it's just the similarities are awesome.

3072
03:52:51.64 --> 03:52:56.64
It's awesome to see, you know, you didn't read this, but you know,

3073
03:52:56.64 --> 03:53:02.64
you know, what's it talks about, humility and staying calm and treating people with respect and trying to help and protect people.

3074
03:53:02.64 --> 03:53:06.64
And it's just these are the things that that we need to do.

3075
03:53:06.64 --> 03:53:13.64
And yeah, I appreciate the fact that you, you've, you've, this, this latest book out to,

3076
03:53:13.64 --> 03:53:18.64
to give people a little guidance, a little something to strive for.

3077
03:53:18.64 --> 03:53:23.64
With that, it's only been about four hours.

3078
03:53:23.64 --> 03:53:30.64
Um, echo, you got anything?

3079
03:53:30.64 --> 03:53:33.64
I don't, I think we covered it.

3080
03:53:33.64 --> 03:53:38.64
He's usually throws a curve ball question at the end, so you're getting off easy.

3081
03:53:38.64 --> 03:53:40.64
Anything else before we close out?

3082
03:53:40.64 --> 03:53:41.64
Yeah.

3083
03:53:41.64 --> 03:53:44.64
I want to thank you, Jaco.

3084
03:53:44.64 --> 03:53:50.64
You know, you have represented the community with such dignity, such honor.

3085
03:53:50.64 --> 03:53:53.64
I love what you're doing. I love what you're doing with the podcast.

3086
03:53:53.64 --> 03:53:54.64
I love what you're doing with your life.

3087
03:53:54.64 --> 03:53:58.64
I love how you are engaging with the community around you.

3088
03:53:58.64 --> 03:54:02.64
You know, it is important for us, particularly at this time.

3089
03:54:02.64 --> 03:54:04.64
You know, the, the community has had its ups and downs.

3090
03:54:04.64 --> 03:54:10.64
We're, we're in a little bit of a trot now, but we need great folks like you to continue to be the sort of

3091
03:54:10.64 --> 03:54:14.64
representatives that people can look up to.

3092
03:54:14.64 --> 03:54:19.64
And so, frankly, I want to take time to thank you for the great work you've done.

3093
03:54:19.64 --> 03:54:24.64
The great example you have set for, you know, not just the new young kids that are going to be

3094
03:54:24.64 --> 03:54:28.64
Seal someday, but frankly for everybody you come in contact with.

3095
03:54:28.64 --> 03:54:31.64
That's, that's incredibly valuable nowadays.

3096
03:54:31.64 --> 03:54:33.64
To thanks.

3097
03:54:33.64 --> 03:54:35.64
I certainly appreciate that.

3098
03:54:35.64 --> 03:54:38.64
I can, I can guarantee you that there's, there's,

3099
03:54:38.64 --> 03:54:47.64
there's the only reason I'm here is because what the community gave to me and the people that I was able to follow and emulate.

3100
03:54:47.64 --> 03:54:50.64
And it's just, it's an honor to be sitting here talking to you.

3101
03:54:50.64 --> 03:54:53.64
And thanks for coming on today.

3102
03:54:53.64 --> 03:54:54.64
I know my pleasure.

3103
03:54:54.64 --> 03:54:56.64
And, and more important.

3104
03:54:56.64 --> 03:55:00.64
Thank you for your service to, to the Navy, to special operations.

3105
03:55:00.64 --> 03:55:03.64
And first and foremost, who are, to our great nation.

3106
03:55:03.64 --> 03:55:05.64
And then someone selfishly.

3107
03:55:05.64 --> 03:55:08.64
Thank you for what you did to the, for the teams.

3108
03:55:08.64 --> 03:55:14.64
Thank you for leading me and, and my fellow frogmen and, and for setting an example.

3109
03:55:14.64 --> 03:55:20.64
That will forever guide our conduct, our character and our ethos.

3110
03:55:20.64 --> 03:55:23.64
There was my honor, thanks.

3111
03:55:23.64 --> 03:55:28.64
And with that Admiral McCraven has left the building.

3112
03:55:28.64 --> 03:55:31.64
So, echo.

3113
03:55:31.64 --> 03:55:32.64
Yes.

3114
03:55:32.64 --> 03:55:35.64
You had no questions, which is kind of surprising.

3115
03:55:35.64 --> 03:55:36.64
It was crazy.

3116
03:55:36.64 --> 03:55:41.64
Did you start connecting the dots on who is in the room?

3117
03:55:41.64 --> 03:55:42.64
Yeah.

3118
03:55:42.64 --> 03:55:44.64
More sudden, things are already new.

3119
03:55:44.64 --> 03:55:48.64
And, well, one of the depends on what you mean, but new.

3120
03:55:48.64 --> 03:55:49.64
Right.

3121
03:55:49.64 --> 03:55:54.64
But, yeah, I knew and I heard, and, you know, I am familiar with Admiral McCraven.

3122
03:55:54.64 --> 03:55:55.64
Okay.

3123
03:55:55.64 --> 03:55:57.64
So, you had, you had connected the dots.

3124
03:55:57.64 --> 03:55:58.64
Oh, yeah, but not all of them, though.

3125
03:55:58.64 --> 03:55:59.64
Okay.

3126
03:55:59.64 --> 03:56:01.64
And it's crazy to just hear them all like the Saddam Hussein one.

3127
03:56:01.64 --> 03:56:04.64
And it didn't connect those dots before.

3128
03:56:04.64 --> 03:56:08.64
The Captain Phillips one, I did not know either.

3129
03:56:08.64 --> 03:56:09.64
But, but.

3130
03:56:09.64 --> 03:56:11.64
So you had connected one out of the dots.

3131
03:56:11.64 --> 03:56:12.64
Yeah, one dot.

3132
03:56:12.64 --> 03:56:18.64
As far as, you know, some of the, some of the most important, special operations.

3133
03:56:18.64 --> 03:56:26.64
So, awesome to have him on here and to be able to hear some of those stories and thoughts.

3134
03:56:26.64 --> 03:56:30.64
So, Admiral McCraven, thank you so much for coming on.

3135
03:56:30.64 --> 03:56:33.64
And, what does this mean for us?

3136
03:56:33.64 --> 03:56:35.64
Well, means we can do a little bit more.

3137
03:56:35.64 --> 03:56:40.64
Means we can certainly, we have work to do.

3138
03:56:40.64 --> 03:56:46.64
The work that we have to do starts with us in order to get better.

3139
03:56:46.64 --> 03:56:49.64
In order to move in the right direction, echo Charles.

3140
03:56:49.64 --> 03:56:50.64
Is there?

3141
03:56:50.64 --> 03:56:56.64
He said something that I, I, I feel like I'm going to kind of take this with more of a lot of things.

3142
03:56:56.64 --> 03:57:01.64
Obviously, but one that really stood out is, and he said it twice, maybe three times.

3143
03:57:01.64 --> 03:57:05.64
Where he's like, my job is to put you set you up for success, right?

3144
03:57:05.64 --> 03:57:07.64
Put you in a position where you can succeed, right?

3145
03:57:07.64 --> 03:57:08.64
That was his deal.

3146
03:57:08.64 --> 03:57:11.64
It's like, man, that's a good way to put it right there.

3147
03:57:11.64 --> 03:57:14.64
Because, you know, how you all, it's like, well, hey, don't micromanage.

3148
03:57:14.64 --> 03:57:17.64
Don't, you know, you want to let your team lead, you know, how you put it.

3149
03:57:17.64 --> 03:57:22.64
And it's like, yeah, if you, because you can apply that to yourself as well.

3150
03:57:22.64 --> 03:57:24.64
Like, bro, set yourself up for some success, man.

3151
03:57:24.64 --> 03:57:27.64
Sounds like a good plan. You know, go learn some stuff.

3152
03:57:27.64 --> 03:57:30.64
Yeah, go, go out, 100%.

3153
03:57:30.64 --> 03:57:32.64
That's a great analogy.

3154
03:57:32.64 --> 03:57:35.64
And I thought you were going to say when he was talking about, look, guys,

3155
03:57:35.64 --> 03:57:37.64
I case, are you got nothing to prove?

3156
03:57:37.64 --> 03:57:38.64
Oh, yeah, though.

3157
03:57:38.64 --> 03:57:39.64
He says, no, you're wrong, actually.

3158
03:57:39.64 --> 03:57:41.64
You got something to prove every day.

3159
03:57:41.64 --> 03:57:45.64
And it's interesting, something I used to talk about to the young seal officers is I would say,

3160
03:57:45.64 --> 03:57:48.64
you have nothing to prove, but everything to prove.

3161
03:57:48.64 --> 03:57:50.64
Because sometimes they think they got to prove that they're in charge,

3162
03:57:50.64 --> 03:57:52.64
so they start barking orders at people and, you know,

3163
03:57:52.64 --> 03:57:55.64
when he's my plan and all that other stuff.

3164
03:57:55.64 --> 03:57:58.64
And you don't have to prove that you're in charge.

3165
03:57:58.64 --> 03:58:00.64
We know you're in charge. You're the officer.

3166
03:58:00.64 --> 03:58:02.64
You're literally called the officer in charge.

3167
03:58:02.64 --> 03:58:04.64
You don't need to prove that.

3168
03:58:04.64 --> 03:58:07.64
But you do need to prove.

3169
03:58:07.64 --> 03:58:09.64
You did, you, you got a lot to prove.

3170
03:58:09.64 --> 03:58:16.64
Yeah, it's like that always struck me as a, like, don't, like, beware of complacency or

3171
03:58:16.64 --> 03:58:21.64
resting on your laurels. You know, like, you know, someone who has the over-stated

3172
03:58:21.64 --> 03:58:25.64
attitude of, I don't have anything to prove when it's like too much of that right?

3173
03:58:25.64 --> 03:58:28.64
Little off balance of the economy kind of thing.

3174
03:58:28.64 --> 03:58:32.64
It's kind of like they did something awesome and then they sort of write it out.

3175
03:58:32.64 --> 03:58:35.64
And then they still think they should get kind of the crowd for it, like,

3176
03:58:35.64 --> 03:58:37.64
a hundred years later or whatever.

3177
03:58:37.64 --> 03:58:39.64
And it's like, hey, like, that's cool that you did that,

3178
03:58:39.64 --> 03:58:43.64
but, but recently you've been kind of doing nothing kind of an added, you know.

3179
03:58:43.64 --> 03:58:47.64
So that's what that always struck me as, where it's like, you always have something to prove.

3180
03:58:47.64 --> 03:58:50.64
Like, don't be like, oh, yeah, you should, like, keep respecting me this much

3181
03:58:50.64 --> 03:58:52.64
first one, like one thing I did yesterday.

3182
03:58:52.64 --> 03:58:59.64
Yeah. Well, you know, 37 years for him in the seal teams in the, in the

3183
03:58:59.64 --> 03:59:05.64
military and again, what's, I think is important is as he said,

3184
03:59:05.64 --> 03:59:09.64
look, there's so many people that did somewhat have done so much work, so much work

3185
03:59:09.64 --> 03:59:14.64
to, to protect America and everybody from, you know,

3186
03:59:14.64 --> 03:59:18.64
obviously the seal teams, but just, you know, we talked about the

3187
03:59:18.64 --> 03:59:22.64
infrastructure men we talked about everybody, there's so much people that work so hard

3188
03:59:22.64 --> 03:59:31.64
to protect freedom. So, I feel like, you know, you have a guy that's a

3189
03:59:31.64 --> 03:59:37.64
four star admin along. And of course, you're going to talk about what his

3190
03:59:37.64 --> 03:59:41.64
experience is worth. And, you know, he's going to give you his perspective,

3191
03:59:41.64 --> 03:59:44.64
but, you know, I try to point out in the beginning, you know,

3192
03:59:44.64 --> 03:59:48.64
animal engraving was always connected to the guys on the front lines and the

3193
03:59:48.64 --> 03:59:53.64
people that are out there making it happen. So, awesome.

3194
03:59:53.64 --> 03:59:59.64
So, we need to set ourselves up for successes, what you were saying before I went on

3195
03:59:59.64 --> 04:00:05.64
a little. Yes, sir. What do we got? How can we set ourselves up for success?

3196
04:00:05.64 --> 04:00:08.64
Well, big things and small things. And then a lot of, you know,

3197
04:00:08.64 --> 04:00:13.64
we're not going to be admiral straight up. I'm not going to be admiral.

3198
04:00:13.64 --> 04:00:19.64
It's very unlikely we'll just say that. Okay. So, I'm going to do maybe my

3199
04:00:19.64 --> 04:00:26.64
small little part to set myself up for success. Okay, just my small little

3200
04:00:26.64 --> 04:00:31.64
part in your world, in my world exactly right. So, what does that look like for me?

3201
04:00:31.64 --> 04:00:34.64
And I think others too. So, this is the good news about this, this kind of

3202
04:00:34.64 --> 04:00:39.64
stuff is that it's achievable by anyone. Just take a few little steps

3203
04:00:39.64 --> 04:00:43.64
out yourself up for success. So, what are we doing reading more? We're working

3204
04:00:43.64 --> 04:00:48.64
out more, keeping ourselves physically and mentally capable. That's what it is.

3205
04:00:48.64 --> 04:00:52.64
An opportunity presents itself. You want to be physically and mentally capable,

3206
04:00:52.64 --> 04:00:57.64
you want to be physically and mentally incapable. That's the question.

3207
04:00:57.64 --> 04:01:01.64
Is this a question for me? We want to be capable. Kind of a rhetorical.

3208
04:01:01.64 --> 04:01:05.64
Kind of obvious question. So, we do that through working out. We do that through

3209
04:01:05.64 --> 04:01:10.64
reading. Pay attention and listening. That's a big one. A lot of us don't do that

3210
04:01:10.64 --> 04:01:15.64
that much anymore. Pay attention and listen. Trust me. Kind of like you're not

3211
04:01:15.64 --> 04:01:19.64
really listening to me. You're not very easy. You see what I'm saying?

3212
04:01:19.64 --> 04:01:24.64
Anyway, on this path that we're doing all this, we do need supplementation.

3213
04:01:24.64 --> 04:01:28.64
So, good news. We're going to start with energy drinks. I'm calling it energy

3214
04:01:28.64 --> 04:01:32.64
drinks. It's a new wave of energy drinks. Do you think that these energy

3215
04:01:32.64 --> 04:01:37.64
drinks that we have created are going to make all other energy drinks obsolete?

3216
04:01:37.64 --> 04:01:42.64
It has the potential to do that as a right now. This is kind of a new thing

3217
04:01:42.64 --> 04:01:48.64
technically. It seems like that's a pretty obvious course.

3218
04:01:48.64 --> 04:01:53.64
People are looking at the old, the dinosaurs. We'll say.

3219
04:01:53.64 --> 04:01:59.64
I think in all this dinosaur, it tastes okay and it gives me energy for an hour.

3220
04:01:59.64 --> 04:02:03.64
But then I ruined my health and I feel like crap.

3221
04:02:03.64 --> 04:02:07.64
Then they look over at this, this, this, this makes me feel a little good.

3222
04:02:07.64 --> 04:02:13.64
And it's actually good for me. This is how this is how the old energy

3223
04:02:13.64 --> 04:02:16.64
drink dinosaurs are going to go extinct. Yes. They're going extinct.

3224
04:02:16.64 --> 04:02:18.64
That looks my predictions. That's my predictions.

3225
04:02:18.64 --> 04:02:21.64
The free can big comet just hit or whatever it was.

3226
04:02:21.64 --> 04:02:23.64
What killed the dinosaurs? I was in a volcano.

3227
04:02:23.64 --> 04:02:26.64
I think it was asteroid. Oh, I think it all. That's the current thing.

3228
04:02:26.64 --> 04:02:31.64
The asteroid just hit the other energy drinks in the form of jacquaddiscipline.

3229
04:02:31.64 --> 04:02:35.64
Go. Oh, yeah. So they're going down. Just anticipating fall out on the ground.

3230
04:02:35.64 --> 04:02:37.64
They're starving. They're dying.

3231
04:02:37.64 --> 04:02:38.64
So yeah. So that's what's going on.

3232
04:02:38.64 --> 04:02:41.64
Boom. New energy drink. No stigma on this one. No.

3233
04:02:41.64 --> 04:02:47.64
No sugar. Sweetened with monk fruit. No unhealthy preservatives. No toxic chemicals.

3234
04:02:47.64 --> 04:02:50.64
No preservatives whatsoever.

3235
04:02:50.64 --> 04:02:52.64
Yeah. It's pasteurized.

3236
04:02:52.64 --> 04:02:57.64
Yeah. Boom. Boom. Manit tastes good. So boom. This thing is good for you straight out.

3237
04:02:57.64 --> 04:03:01.64
All upside no downside short term and long term benefits.

3238
04:03:01.64 --> 04:03:05.64
Boom. Strategic and tactical discipline. Go.

3239
04:03:05.64 --> 04:03:09.64
There's also discipline going powder and capsule format. Don't forget about that one.

3240
04:03:09.64 --> 04:03:12.64
Also, we got stuff for you joins. Keep your joints in the game.

3241
04:03:12.64 --> 04:03:15.64
Don't have to worry about that anymore. Yes, right. Did squads.

3242
04:03:15.64 --> 04:03:18.64
You did squads win Monday, right? There's something like this.

3243
04:03:18.64 --> 04:03:20.64
Yeah. I think it was.

3244
04:03:20.64 --> 04:03:24.64
So I always think about this where I'm older than I was before.

3245
04:03:24.64 --> 04:03:25.64
Mm-hmm.

3246
04:03:25.64 --> 04:03:28.64
And so I incorporated the deep squads. Right?

3247
04:03:28.64 --> 04:03:31.64
Yeah. From your influence and I thank you for it.

3248
04:03:31.64 --> 04:03:35.64
And you think with a deep squads, especially when you go hard, it's like, okay, you know, my knees.

3249
04:03:35.64 --> 04:03:38.64
Because that's a lot of times that's the, that's the, what you get.

3250
04:03:38.64 --> 04:03:42.64
Like it's like, oh yeah, I did, if you suggest deep squads, so somebody will be all my knees or, you know,

3251
04:03:42.64 --> 04:03:43.64
and I get it.

3252
04:03:43.64 --> 04:03:50.64
True. So every time I think about this, like this joint stuff, like my joints, I think about the squads.

3253
04:03:50.64 --> 04:03:51.64
Got it.

3254
04:03:51.64 --> 04:03:55.64
By the way, yes, yesterday, I started warming up to in squads. My brother came over.

3255
04:03:55.64 --> 04:03:59.64
Jade, we started to tell you know, you get into conversations, whatever the comment.

3256
04:03:59.64 --> 04:04:00.64
And then I went to squads.

3257
04:04:00.64 --> 04:04:04.64
So I'm, well, you know, I'm doing the warmups.

3258
04:04:04.64 --> 04:04:05.64
Okay.

3259
04:04:05.64 --> 04:04:08.64
First, why don't we get in this conversation while I'm warming up?

3260
04:04:08.64 --> 04:04:11.64
I do one preset I was explained to Carrie.

3261
04:04:11.64 --> 04:04:13.64
I do one preset.

3262
04:04:13.64 --> 04:04:14.64
Okay, dog. Okay, dog.

3263
04:04:14.64 --> 04:04:15.64
Oh yeah, I'll do it.

3264
04:04:15.64 --> 04:04:19.64
And it's basically one set, one, it's like a half working set.

3265
04:04:19.64 --> 04:04:22.64
It's like the way that I'm going to use for my first working set.

3266
04:04:22.64 --> 04:04:24.64
I do that, but not as many reps as someone.

3267
04:04:24.64 --> 04:04:25.64
Yeah, so I'll do it.

3268
04:04:25.64 --> 04:04:26.64
It's like a priming kind of thing.

3269
04:04:26.64 --> 04:04:28.64
So I do that, right?

3270
04:04:28.64 --> 04:04:31.64
Boom, right at that point, the conversation goes deep.

3271
04:04:31.64 --> 04:04:38.64
So like, we're just talking two hours, two and a half homeless hours,

3272
04:04:38.64 --> 04:04:40.64
before my first set.

3273
04:04:40.64 --> 04:04:43.64
Also now you see, you're saying, either there's a two hour lag time.

3274
04:04:43.64 --> 04:04:46.64
Like time between my private and private sets.

3275
04:04:46.64 --> 04:04:51.64
So, so in my normal course of action, that kind of stuff happened.

3276
04:04:51.64 --> 04:04:54.64
This was happening before it was like, hey, my conversation came and

3277
04:04:54.64 --> 04:04:56.64
hey, sorry, I skipped the workout.

3278
04:04:56.64 --> 04:04:58.64
You know, the sun went down straight up.

3279
04:04:58.64 --> 04:05:00.64
It's dark nighttime, ready?

3280
04:05:00.64 --> 04:05:01.64
I don't know, eight, 30, maybe.

3281
04:05:01.64 --> 04:05:03.64
And it's like, well, you know, I'm all cold.

3282
04:05:03.64 --> 04:05:06.64
I've been sitting down talking for two and a half hours.

3283
04:05:06.64 --> 04:05:07.64
I'm not warm anymore.

3284
04:05:07.64 --> 04:05:09.64
And let's face it, but it's almost bedtime.

3285
04:05:09.64 --> 04:05:12.64
Why are people kind of coming around your gym to talk to you?

3286
04:05:12.64 --> 04:05:15.64
Like, that's my gym is on the side of my house outside.

3287
04:05:15.64 --> 04:05:18.64
Yeah, and you know, hey, that's a conversation for another time.

3288
04:05:18.64 --> 04:05:19.64
For sure.

3289
04:05:19.64 --> 04:05:20.64
But it's a nifkin.

3290
04:05:20.64 --> 04:05:24.64
Nonetheless, so I go inside and I'm like, hey, cool, I'll do the squats tomorrow,

3291
04:05:24.64 --> 04:05:25.64
whatever, all good.

3292
04:05:25.64 --> 04:05:29.64
So I go inside, I take off my shoes and I'm like, drink some water, whatever.

3293
04:05:29.64 --> 04:05:33.64
And Jade's leaving in the front and they leave him like, I was like, no man.

3294
04:05:33.64 --> 04:05:35.64
No, it's not going to get me this time.

3295
04:05:35.64 --> 04:05:37.64
Conversation, no conversation.

3296
04:05:37.64 --> 04:05:39.64
Go back out and finish the whole squat.

3297
04:05:39.64 --> 04:05:41.64
Actually, I added one more set to like it by the way.

3298
04:05:41.64 --> 04:05:42.64
There you go.

3299
04:05:42.64 --> 04:05:46.64
The world right now collectively is celebrating your first season.

3300
04:05:46.64 --> 04:05:49.64
Oh yeah, so my dad, ad.

3301
04:05:49.64 --> 04:05:50.64
Do I work for?

3302
04:05:50.64 --> 04:05:51.64
Do I work?

3303
04:05:51.64 --> 04:05:54.64
I was not worried about my joints any at any moment.

3304
04:05:54.64 --> 04:05:55.64
My knee joints in this project.

3305
04:05:55.64 --> 04:05:57.64
You're worried about his mouth.

3306
04:05:57.64 --> 04:06:00.64
I know where I got to curve that little bit.

3307
04:06:00.64 --> 04:06:02.64
You got joy warfare on your jaw bone.

3308
04:06:02.64 --> 04:06:07.64
Not your jaw bone.

3309
04:06:07.64 --> 04:06:11.64
Anyway, success all around, join when for Super Cruil Oil, all day.

3310
04:06:11.64 --> 04:06:13.64
Also, we got some immunity stuff.

3311
04:06:13.64 --> 04:06:15.64
This is important as well, you don't get sleep.

3312
04:06:15.64 --> 04:06:18.64
You were kind of talking about it that morning, getting dressed up

3313
04:06:18.64 --> 04:06:21.64
In a couple of I had to messed up sleep schedule past,

3314
04:06:21.64 --> 04:06:23.64
not last night, two nights before that.

3315
04:06:23.64 --> 04:06:24.64
Yeah, I had one last night.

3316
04:06:24.64 --> 04:06:28.64
Anyway, lack of sleep, lack of this, lack of that can kind of

3317
04:06:28.64 --> 04:06:30.64
Jam up your immune system to worry about that kind of stuff,

3318
04:06:30.64 --> 04:06:33.24
You've got supplements for that.

3319
04:06:33.24 --> 04:06:36.36
Good cold war.

3320
04:06:36.36 --> 04:06:37.08
Vitamin D3.

3321
04:06:37.08 --> 04:06:37.92
Boom.

3322
04:06:37.92 --> 04:06:39.36
Don't worry about your moon system either.

3323
04:06:39.36 --> 04:06:42.08
Joint immune system, no factor right there.

3324
04:06:42.08 --> 04:06:45.24
Also, milk.

3325
04:06:45.24 --> 04:06:47.72
Supplemental protein in the form of dessert.

3326
04:06:47.72 --> 04:06:49.40
That's some good stuff as well.

3327
04:06:49.40 --> 04:06:51.96
Hold on to the story, but good stuff nonetheless.

3328
04:06:51.96 --> 04:06:52.96
Yeah, you don't.

3329
04:06:52.96 --> 04:06:53.96
Let's face it.

3330
04:06:53.96 --> 04:06:55.96
You want ice cream.

3331
04:06:55.96 --> 04:06:58.40
Ice cream has a lot of downside to it.

3332
04:06:58.40 --> 04:06:59.24
Yes it does.

3333
04:06:59.24 --> 04:07:02.68
Have milk all upside, no downside.

3334
04:07:02.68 --> 04:07:03.68
Yeah.

3335
04:07:03.68 --> 04:07:05.68
Upside legit upside.

3336
04:07:05.68 --> 04:07:06.68
Yeah.

3337
04:07:06.68 --> 04:07:10.36
So to put that into perspective, and I just heard this, I don't even know where I was listening

3338
04:07:10.36 --> 04:07:11.36
to something.

3339
04:07:11.36 --> 04:07:16.56
But, and it reminded me, some people eat like a thing of ice cream every single day.

3340
04:07:16.56 --> 04:07:17.56
It's like a thing.

3341
04:07:17.56 --> 04:07:19.20
You know, like, oh, I ate that for a while.

3342
04:07:19.20 --> 04:07:20.20
Every single day.

3343
04:07:20.20 --> 04:07:21.20
Every single day.

3344
04:07:21.20 --> 04:07:23.20
I remember I was running so much.

3345
04:07:23.20 --> 04:07:24.20
I was running so much.

3346
04:07:24.20 --> 04:07:25.20
I think it was that.

3347
04:07:25.20 --> 04:07:27.20
I was out of teeth too.

3348
04:07:27.20 --> 04:07:33.32
And every day was like, okay, Monday, P.T. was like, P.T. and the run.

3349
04:07:33.32 --> 04:07:36.88
Tuesday, P.T. was, of course, and the run.

3350
04:07:36.88 --> 04:07:40.36
Wednesday was swim and the run.

3351
04:07:40.36 --> 04:07:43.52
Thursday was P.T. and the run again.

3352
04:07:43.52 --> 04:07:45.36
And then Friday was a run.

3353
04:07:45.36 --> 04:07:46.52
What can run?

3354
04:07:46.52 --> 04:07:50.88
The Friday run, which Admiral talked about was like a 10 mile or 12 mile.

3355
04:07:50.88 --> 04:07:51.88
Sorry.

3356
04:07:51.88 --> 04:07:52.88
I was 10 miles per hour.

3357
04:07:52.88 --> 04:07:54.36
Yeah, I would come back for that.

3358
04:07:54.36 --> 04:07:56.96
I would do my 20 reps squat routine too.

3359
04:07:56.96 --> 04:08:00.000
I was eating ice cream with a total of bandages.

3360
04:08:00.000 --> 04:08:01.60
Yeah, just get it.

3361
04:08:01.60 --> 04:08:10.20
Yeah, so the situation I was hearing about reminded that reminded me of the concept that some

3362
04:08:10.20 --> 04:08:12.80
people don't do these crazy runs or workouts or whatever.

3363
04:08:12.80 --> 04:08:14.64
It's just part of their normal everyday routine.

3364
04:08:14.64 --> 04:08:17.16
Like, hey, let me just eat some ice cream every single day.

3365
04:08:17.16 --> 04:08:20.36
You know, some obvious detriment when you do that.

3366
04:08:20.36 --> 04:08:21.36
Can stuff.

3367
04:08:21.36 --> 04:08:22.36
You drink the oyster.

3368
04:08:22.36 --> 04:08:24.52
You replace the ice cream with the milk.

3369
04:08:24.52 --> 04:08:25.52
You got the.

3370
04:08:25.52 --> 04:08:26.92
You got the same front side.

3371
04:08:26.92 --> 04:08:28.60
Yeah, or front end payoff.

3372
04:08:28.60 --> 04:08:30.96
Yeah, but away different back in payoff.

3373
04:08:30.96 --> 04:08:37.000
Actually, you get a back in payoff unlike the back end of price cost.

3374
04:08:37.000 --> 04:08:38.000
Hey, you can get this stuff.

3375
04:08:38.000 --> 04:08:39.36
Jockelfield.com.

3376
04:08:39.36 --> 04:08:43.96
If you if you subscribe to it, it's free shipping, which is legit thing because right

3377
04:08:43.96 --> 04:08:45.000
now there's let's face it.

3378
04:08:45.000 --> 04:08:50.12
There's large, rather large, extremely large companies that are trying to lure you in to

3379
04:08:50.12 --> 04:08:54.80
their little realm by giving you free shipping.

3380
04:08:54.80 --> 04:08:55.80
And we understand that.

3381
04:08:55.80 --> 04:08:56.80
We got to compete with them.

3382
04:08:56.80 --> 04:09:01.08
So if you subscribe free shipping, you can do double support.

3383
04:09:01.08 --> 04:09:02.08
Much appreciated.

3384
04:09:02.08 --> 04:09:04.52
Also, we got origin USA.com.

3385
04:09:04.52 --> 04:09:09.64
If you need a digital, if you need jeans, if you need boots, if you need a t-shirt,

3386
04:09:09.64 --> 04:09:16.24
if you need a belt, you can get it all origin USA.com.

3387
04:09:16.24 --> 04:09:20.88
The USA part is not some sort of thrown on branding cool.

3388
04:09:20.88 --> 04:09:25.32
No, because the stuff is freaking made in America, 100% without compromise.

3389
04:09:25.32 --> 04:09:27.04
Look about that.

3390
04:09:27.04 --> 04:09:29.40
We're talking about fighting for America.

3391
04:09:29.40 --> 04:09:30.40
Cool.

3392
04:09:30.40 --> 04:09:31.40
That's awesome.

3393
04:09:31.40 --> 04:09:32.40
We love it.

3394
04:09:32.40 --> 04:09:33.40
Guess what else we're going to do?

3395
04:09:33.40 --> 04:09:36.92
We're going to support the economy here, because without the American economy, nothing

3396
04:09:36.92 --> 04:09:37.92
else matters.

3397
04:09:37.92 --> 04:09:40.56
You don't have a military unless you have a good economy.

3398
04:09:40.56 --> 04:09:42.16
So support the American economy.

3399
04:09:42.16 --> 04:09:50.64
Stuff that's made in America with raw materials that were made or grown or produced in America.

3400
04:09:50.64 --> 04:09:51.64
That's what we're doing.

3401
04:09:51.64 --> 04:09:55.16
USA.com, get it, it's true.

3402
04:09:55.16 --> 04:09:58.04
Also, jocos, or called jocos store.

3403
04:09:58.04 --> 04:09:59.64
This is where you can get your just one equals three.

3404
04:09:59.64 --> 04:10:00.64
I'm good.

3405
04:10:00.64 --> 04:10:01.64
Get after it.

3406
04:10:01.64 --> 04:10:10.64
All the, all the representative ideas of the path on your apparel is where you can get it.

3407
04:10:10.64 --> 04:10:13.88
Also, we have a subscription as well for shipping on this one.

3408
04:10:13.88 --> 04:10:14.88
Only in the USA though.

3409
04:10:14.88 --> 04:10:15.88
That's a right now.

3410
04:10:15.88 --> 04:10:19.52
But we're working on the International scenario, but only in the USA.

3411
04:10:19.52 --> 04:10:21.28
It's called shirt locker.

3412
04:10:21.28 --> 04:10:25.76
This is where you can get shirts with a little bit different, more creative.

3413
04:10:25.76 --> 04:10:30.08
Same or fun designs for lack of a better way of maybe putting it.

3414
04:10:30.08 --> 04:10:31.40
Anyway, they're more interesting.

3415
04:10:31.40 --> 04:10:32.40
You get one every month.

3416
04:10:32.40 --> 04:10:33.84
It's kind of interesting to be a lighter word.

3417
04:10:33.84 --> 04:10:36.36
Because once I get a hold of a couple designs, it's going to be not fun.

3418
04:10:36.36 --> 04:10:37.36
It's going to be dark.

3419
04:10:37.36 --> 04:10:38.36
It's not fun.

3420
04:10:38.36 --> 04:10:41.36
It's going to be more cool.

3421
04:10:41.36 --> 04:10:45.32
Well, they're cool right now, but they're light-hearted.

3422
04:10:45.32 --> 04:10:46.32
Some of them.

3423
04:10:46.32 --> 04:10:47.32
Yes.

3424
04:10:47.32 --> 04:10:49.32
People seem to be enjoying them.

3425
04:10:49.32 --> 04:10:50.80
So yeah, free shipping on that one.

3426
04:10:50.80 --> 04:10:51.80
Yeah, every month is a good one.

3427
04:10:51.80 --> 04:10:52.80
Check it out.

3428
04:10:52.80 --> 04:10:53.96

It costs $8.18 a month.

3439
04:11:17.32 --> 04:11:18.32
What are we doing with that?

3440
04:11:18.32 --> 04:11:22.64
Creating a platform of our own that if things go sideways, we got a contingency plan.

3441
04:11:22.64 --> 04:11:26.64
We'll meet you in the underground, jockel underground.com.

3442
04:11:26.64 --> 04:11:27.64
Come and check that out.

3443
04:11:27.64 --> 04:11:30.48
We have a YouTube channel, by the way.

3444
04:11:30.48 --> 04:11:32.88
And we make videos.

3445
04:11:32.88 --> 04:11:33.88
We make videos.

3446
04:11:33.88 --> 04:11:40.12
We have obviously, you all know, Ecos got some technical skills that he can put to

3447
04:11:40.12 --> 04:11:45.000
you so he can do the editing and some of that other sort of, sort of, did the just technical

3448
04:11:45.000 --> 04:11:46.000
skills.

3449
04:11:46.000 --> 04:11:50.72
Then obviously, I come in with the assistant director and I kind of created and the creative

3450
04:11:50.72 --> 04:11:56.08
side, the creative element, the vision and the talent, by the way, you're the talent.

3451
04:11:56.08 --> 04:11:59.76
But I do appreciate you're being able to edit properly.

3452
04:11:59.76 --> 04:12:07.28
So if you want to see Ecos edits and my vision, check out.

3453
04:12:07.28 --> 04:12:14.24
Speaking of jockel's vision and my lack of vision from time to time, psychological warfare,

3454
04:12:14.24 --> 04:12:20.16
the novel, with tracks of jockel telling you how to skip, not skip, not skip, not skip.

3455
04:12:20.16 --> 04:12:21.16
Okay.

3456
04:12:21.16 --> 04:12:24.88
Workouts if you're in the mood to skip or work out.

3457
04:12:24.88 --> 04:12:30.38
Like basically to achieve what I achieved last night, let's say you don't have that

3458
04:12:30.38 --> 04:12:31.38
forwarded to that day.

3459
04:12:31.38 --> 04:12:33.32
Don't worry, jockel got you on this one.

3460
04:12:33.32 --> 04:12:35.000
This goes for a lot of other weaknesses as well.

3461
04:12:35.000 --> 04:12:36.000
So check that one out.

3462
04:12:36.000 --> 04:12:37.000
Psychological warfare.

04:12:48.72 --> 04:12:49.72
We got some books.

04:12:49.72 --> 04:12:51.04
You heard about some of them today.

3468
04:12:51.04 --> 04:12:52.04
Spec ops.

3469
04:12:52.04 --> 04:12:56.24
These are from Admo William H. McRaven.

3470
04:12:56.24 --> 04:12:57.72
We got Spec ops.

3471
04:12:57.72 --> 04:12:58.96
We got Make Your Bed.

3472
04:12:58.96 --> 04:13:02.60
We got C stories and we got the latest, the hero code.

3473
04:13:02.60 --> 04:13:05.04
Those are available on our website.

3474
04:13:05.04 --> 04:13:11.40
If you go to jockelpontcast.com and you click on books from the podcast, they'll all be there.

3475
04:13:11.40 --> 04:13:14.56
That's also way to support, too, by the way.

3476
04:13:14.56 --> 04:13:15.64
We got final spin.

3477
04:13:15.64 --> 04:13:20.24
This is my book that's coming out.

3478
04:13:20.24 --> 04:13:23.48
You're going to want that first edition.

3479
04:13:23.48 --> 04:13:24.68
You're going to want the first edition.

04:13:24.68 --> 04:13:26.68
Order that right now, the publishers.

3481
04:13:26.68 --> 04:13:28.68
We are in America.

3482
04:13:28.68 --> 04:13:32.32
You're not really a fiction writer.

3483
04:13:32.32 --> 04:13:35.04
We don't know people are probably not going to appreciate your work.

3484
04:13:35.04 --> 04:13:38.44
They're more looking for, that's what they're saying.

3485
04:13:38.44 --> 04:13:42.48
We're like, okay, we'll print a limited number of copies.

3486
04:13:42.48 --> 04:13:44.76
Technically aren't you a fictional writer?

3487
04:13:44.76 --> 04:13:46.72
Yes, because I've written a bunch of fiction kids books.

3488
04:13:46.72 --> 04:13:48.24
You want to correct?

3489
04:13:48.24 --> 04:13:49.72
I made that point as well.

3490
04:13:49.72 --> 04:13:50.72
And then they said that.

3491
04:13:50.72 --> 04:13:52.72
They can't find a fake answer.

3492
04:13:52.72 --> 04:13:53.72
Good.

3493
04:13:53.72 --> 04:13:58.40
So, look, book comes out.

3494
04:13:58.40 --> 04:14:01.000
We got to let them know at least to print enough.

3495
04:14:01.000 --> 04:14:04.000
So, if you want to preorder that one, you get that first edition.

3496
04:14:04.000 --> 04:14:06.88
Go ahead and make that happen.

3541
04:16:10.84 --> 04:16:11.84
at Echo Charles.

3542
04:16:11.84 --> 04:16:13.76
And I am at Jockel Willingck.

3543
04:16:13.76 --> 04:16:27.12
And thanks once again to Admiral McCraven for everything too much to sum up.

3544
04:16:27.12 --> 04:16:35.44
Thanks to all the soldiers, sailors, and random Marines who have been on the battlefield.

3545
04:16:35.44 --> 04:16:43.80
Well, for hundreds of years, and who allow America and freedom and democracy to exist.

3546
04:16:43.80 --> 04:16:48.48
And the same goes to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

3547
04:16:48.48 --> 04:16:52.20
correctional officers, board of patrol secret service and all first responders.

3548
04:16:52.20 --> 04:16:57.08
Thank you for your protection here at home.

3549
04:16:57.08 --> 04:17:04.76
And everyone else out there, I didn't quite get into it to this book that he wrote code.

3550
04:17:04.76 --> 04:17:12.40
And Admiral McCraven gives some guidance on how a hero should live.

3551
04:17:12.40 --> 04:17:21.28
But another thing that he indicates is that you are the hero we need.

3552
04:17:21.28 --> 04:17:27.68
It's you to go out there and get after it.

3553
04:17:27.68 --> 04:17:31.88
Then until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.
