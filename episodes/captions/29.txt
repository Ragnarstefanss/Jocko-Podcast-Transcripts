[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 29 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:12] Into the midst of this war torn land, we're inserted 22 able body to American soldiers and a platoon leader.
[00:00:22] As I made my way to the Patoon Command post, CP, the Sun had already dropped from the sky,
[00:00:29] night in the tropics comes fast, and even as I approach the outgoing platoon leader,
[00:00:34] the shadows have begun to obscure his facial features. I found him lying on his stomach in
[00:00:41] a depression situated roughly in the center of the platoon. As I bent over to introduce myself,
[00:00:48] he motioned for me to get down. Assuming that perhaps I was dangerously exposed, I laid down next to him.
[00:00:55] Hello, I'm Jim McDonough. I said, feeling somewhat awkward being so formal while lying on my stomach.
[00:01:07] Tom Rolf, he said, are you here to take my place? He was unable to conceal his eagerness.
[00:01:16] Yes, I replied. Can you tell me what's going on here?
[00:01:19] As he began briefing me, it became apparent that the platoon was not the object of his thoughts.
[00:01:28] I asked questions about the disposition of the squads, the personalities of the men,
[00:01:32] the tactics of the enemy, the attitude of the villagers. He responded by telling me about how difficult
[00:01:39] the job was, how much his family needed him, how he never asked to be an infantry lieutenant,
[00:01:44] how dangerous and uncomfortable his life had been of late, and how he did not deserve to be wounded or killed.
[00:01:53] He was overcome by fear that on his last night in the field, the enemy would somehow
[00:01:58] snatch survival away from him. As the hours passed, we did not move from our position in the midst of
[00:02:06] the platoon. I became a cutely conscious of our protected posture. All about us, I could hear movement.
[00:02:16] I saw silhouettes of soldiers as they moved about, setting up their positions for the night.
[00:02:21] I noted that at least one patrol departed from the perimeter, but that the orders for the
[00:02:26] patrol did not come from the lieutenant. Rolf lay there, chattering aimlessly into the night,
[00:02:33] describing again and again for me the wife and two children he had left behind.
[00:02:40] Gradually, he honed in on his point. You've got to understand. I did this for them. They need me.
[00:02:48] They need me in one piece. Nervous silence followed as I tried to find his eyes in the darkness.
[00:02:56] What was he talking about? The question arose even as the answer was forming all around me
[00:03:03] they know what to do. They're good soldiers. Silence again. He was shocked by his own confession.
[00:03:13] But at the same time, he was urged on by the bearing of his soul.
[00:03:20] I could have been a hero. Sometimes I even wanted to be, but I had to think of my family. You see,
[00:03:26] don't you? Most of these men don't have any family. They're just boys.
[00:03:30] This shamefulness of his words hit me like a club. He was not the leader of this
[00:03:37] platoon. He felt no responsibility for the mission. He felt no compassion for his men.
[00:03:42] In his mind, the other members of the platoon existed for only one reason to protect him,
[00:03:49] to keep him alive. They were expendable. He was not. He had reason to live.
[00:03:56] They did not. I wanted to crawl away, but it was dark and I had no idea where to go. We stopped talking.
[00:04:07] I had nothing more to ask. He wanted to say more about his personal concerns. He knew he had gone too
[00:04:14] far, but he didn't care. His only concern in the world was to leave that noll as soon as possible.
[00:04:19] The platoon and I could be damned. If he survived, justice would have been done.
[00:04:27] That night, nothing else mattered for him. His soul lay naked, stripped of pride, guilt, and shame.
[00:04:37] They were affections of the civilized world out here, only living mattered.
[00:04:46] Unable to sleep, unable to move, I lay there wondering which I would turn out to be.
[00:04:53] The crazed killer I had met in Qnon, or the blatant coward beside me in the dark.
[00:05:00] Which one was more devoid of humanity? I did not know.
[00:05:05] Later, after almost three months in the field, I saw Role again.
[00:05:09] At the battalion, secure behind the battalion perimeter of L. Z. North English,
[00:05:17] he had adopted an air of bravado. In the safety of the officers club, he told me of his brave deeds.
[00:05:25] He talked as one who had seen it all. In his own words, he became the dashing, fearless leader of combat infantrymen.
[00:05:33] He even had a few combat awards for valor, the procurement of which fell among his duties.
[00:05:44] But the most amazing thing of all was his belief in every one of his own words.
[00:05:51] As far as he consciously knew, he was all he claimed to be.
[00:05:56] He had forgotten how he lay quivering in the dark praying for the enemy, not to come.
[00:06:05] From that point on, I began to watch myself carefully.
[00:06:10] Was I really what I thought I was, or had I diluted myself as effectively as Role had?
[00:06:20] Then the morning the helicopter came to take Role away.
[00:06:23] He brought himself to his knees, which was as high as I had seen him rise since my arrival the night before,
[00:06:30] and without a word of farewell to me or any of the soldiers he made a desperate dash for the helicopter.
[00:06:37] In an instant he was gone, and I recognized with a feeling of awe that I was now in command.
[00:06:46] Good evening echo. Good evening.
[00:06:56] Back in Vietnam the night.
[00:06:59] And this book right here is called Platoon Leader, a memoir of command in combat by James R. McDonough.
[00:07:12] He served. He went to West Point.
[00:07:18] So four years at West Point, and then he got assigned to the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam.
[00:07:27] And one thing about this book, and this is a fantastic book.
[00:07:33] And I'll tell you there's a quote on the back of the book here.
[00:07:36] It's the Marine Corps Gazette wrote this.
[00:07:39] Stands alone is the finest statement of what it means to be the commander of a small unit.
[00:07:46] I hope that every Platoon leader reads, ponderes, and truly absorbs the words of Lieutenant Colonel McDonough.
[00:07:58] So it starts off there that was him going to this small little perimeter,
[00:08:07] but Platoon perimeter. Outside of a village in Vietnam, he's taking over from the outgoing Platoon commander.
[00:08:16] And again, this is something very different than we do in the SEAL teams where you just have a random new
[00:08:20] guy show up. It's going to take charge. We're lucky. The way we're set up, we do like an entire
[00:08:25] work up and prepare for deployment with the same guys. We're going to be on deployment with.
[00:08:30] And then we all go on deployment together. We work together and win the deployments over. We go home.
[00:08:34] It's a very solid way of running that system. This is different. There's guys trickling in and out
[00:08:40] all the time throughout the entire chain of command, all the way up from the frontline guys,
[00:08:45] all the way up to the commander of the Platoon. Fresh out of West Point,
[00:08:54] fresh out of college. Yeah, it's a military college, but shows up in Vietnam and here he is in the bush.
[00:09:04] Back to the book. I was alone. That was my first sensation as a leader. I gathered up my belongings,
[00:09:14] my weapon web gear and rucksack and moved toward the command post. I needed a few minutes to
[00:09:19] gather my thoughts before I made my debut as Platoon leader. I knew it was going to be a tricky
[00:09:24] business. I had assumed that I would have a company commander nearby to give me orders,
[00:09:31] but I had not even met him yet. I would not meet him for weeks. So that's the guy who's above
[00:09:36] the Platoon commanders, the company commander. You know, in his mind, he thinks he's going to have
[00:09:40] this company commander somewhere nearby and mentoring him and telling what to do, not happening.
[00:09:44] Doesn't have an even hasn't even met him. He's taken over the Platoon. He hasn't even met the
[00:09:47] company commander yet. I would not meet him for weeks. The fact was I was totally on my own.
[00:09:55] What should I do? Who's advice could I ask? The Platoon sergeants, the squad leaders.
[00:10:00] In time I would listen to their ideas and cooperate them with my own, but I could hardly begin
[00:10:05] with, well, what do you think we ought to do, men? No, I knew that the basic decisions were mine to make.
[00:10:13] Now, I might go in that situation a little bit different and I wouldn't have any
[00:10:16] problem. Ask in Platoon sergeants. Then ask in squad leaders. Hey, guys, what's going on?
[00:10:21] Getting some feedback from them? What's been working? What's not? I don't think there's any,
[00:10:26] I don't think there's anything wrong with that at all. He took a little different tact. He didn't
[00:10:32] feel comfortable doing that. And you know, one of the reasons why he didn't feel comfortable doing that
[00:10:37] because he's young. He's fresh out of college and he's a little nervous step in this combat role.
[00:10:42] Obviously, back to the book. The first few moments would be crucial. Obviously, I was the
[00:10:51] object of interest that morning. Everyone was wondering what the new Lieutenant would be like
[00:10:57] and I would be telling them with my first words, my gestures, my demeanor, my eyes.
[00:11:04] So he knows that everything he does, they're watching him and they're judging him.
[00:11:07] I would have no grace period in which to learn my way around. This was a life and death environment.
[00:11:16] If I began with a blunder, my credibility as a leader would be shot and so might some of the men.
[00:11:24] I decided to begin by giving my attention to tactics in a military environment.
[00:11:31] Everything is determined by tactical considerations, where you sleep, when you sleep, where you go,
[00:11:36] what you do and in those company, you do it. All are dictated by underlying tactical necessities.
[00:11:46] I would communicate my style of leadership through my tactical instructions.
[00:11:51] Pretty good call. Pretty good call. Let's just talk tactics. Something that we're all familiar with.
[00:11:58] The first thing that occurred to me was the necessity of sending out patrols.
[00:12:07] If our actions were strictly defensive, the enemy would be free to pick their tactics. The
[00:12:13] initiative would be theirs and this would eventually disprove the illusion of security that the
[00:12:17] perimeter wire offered. By training told me that a completely defensive unit is a prime target
[00:12:25] for an overwhelming attack. Boom. He knows that out of the gate. Again, they've got this nice little
[00:12:31] perimeter set up. They've got 30 or so guys there. They've got to defend this perimeter from attack.
[00:12:38] But instead of just staying in a defensive position, he's like we got to go out on patrol.
[00:12:42] We got to get out there. We got to disrupt what the enemy's doing.
[00:12:48] In combat leadership, as in real estate, location is everything. I was the platoon leader,
[00:12:55] and the patroling would be done by squad size elements. Normally, there were 10 men in the squad
[00:13:01] and four squads in a rifle platoon. But personnel strengthed being what they were. My squads were
[00:13:08] down to only six or seven of men apiece. And there were only three squads. I would be risking
[00:13:14] over supervision of the patroling squad. Whose direction was better left to the squad leader if I
[00:13:21] went with it? I would also be away from the majority of my platoon back at the perimeter. On the
[00:13:27] other hand, to stay with the two squads in the perimeter would deny me the knowledge of the terrain
[00:13:33] in which the my platoon operated, and the opportunity to evaluate the quality of the patrols,
[00:13:39] the major offensive activity of my tactical position. Moreover, I would not be sharing the highest
[00:13:46] risk operations of my men and would therefore might lose their respect. I also might miss my best
[00:13:52] chance to appreciate their perceptions, needs, and attitudes. Finally, I might slip into a defensive
[00:14:00] attitude myself, and that attitude would eventually overtake the entire platoon.
[00:14:08] So, basically, there aren't their inside that perimeter. He's got three squads, and he's sending
[00:14:13] the one squad out on patrol on a fairly regular basis. And he's the question, is, you know,
[00:14:19] where should I go? What should I do? And he decides that the best thing for him to do is rotate through
[00:14:26] and go on patrol with them sometimes. And I love the point of more over, I would not be sharing
[00:14:33] in the highest risk operations of my men. So, he knows he's got to take some of the risk that
[00:14:37] they're taking, that will also give him a chance to appreciate their perceptions, needs, and attitudes.
[00:14:43] So, if you're in a leadership position, and you never get down to the frontline troops and see what
[00:14:47] they're doing, see what they're doing on the job site, see what they're doing in the field,
[00:14:52] see what's going on out there, you can't understand it. And then he says this, finally,
[00:14:58] I might slip into a defensive attitude myself, and that attitude would eventually overtake
[00:15:03] the entire platoon, because they're all going to turn into what he's turned into. Or what he is.
[00:15:11] Back to the book, if a patrol made contact with the enemy, and it lasted for any length of time,
[00:15:16] a second squad would be sent to react. If I were inside the perimeter at such a time,
[00:15:21] I would move out with the reaction squad. I firmly believed it was the duty of the combat leader to
[00:15:27] move to the sound of the guns, especially when a majority of the unit was engaged.
[00:15:37] So, he's going to be there when things go sideways. He's going to move.
[00:15:43] Now, back to his feelings on what this is like, even more on spiring than the scenery was the realization
[00:15:51] that whatever took place in this part of the world, whatever these men did, or whatever
[00:15:57] happened to them, was my responsibility. I might describe myself as a long for the ride,
[00:16:04] but whatever happened here, or back at the perimeter, I would have to account for,
[00:16:09] to my superiors, to my men, and to myself. I felt I was living a lie. I was trying desperately to
[00:16:18] learn what I was already supposed to know. So, the reason he's talking about that is when he goes
[00:16:25] out with the squads, there's a guy that's jueyered to him, a sergeant that's running the squads,
[00:16:31] running the patrol, and he's not going to go out there and be the boss. He's going to go out there
[00:16:35] sort of along for the ride. He's not going to take charge of the squad, he's going to let them do
[00:16:40] what they do, and he's going to be more of an observer. But he's, but that doesn't relinquish any
[00:16:45] responsibility from him. He still owns it. He's still taking ownership of the whole thing.
[00:16:49] And this statement about I felt I was living a lie. I was trying to desperately to learn what I was
[00:16:54] already supposed to know. That's very common. For anybody stepping up into a new leadership position,
[00:16:59] you don't think you're ready for it. I mean, often, sometimes you feel confident. But a lot of
[00:17:03] times people, people who hit me up with questions, they say, you know, I'm taking, I've been promoted.
[00:17:07] I don't think I'm ready to do that job. There's very common to feel like that. And my statement
[00:17:12] I've said it before, it's okay. Yeah, you know, there's a cognitive bias that
[00:17:17] when you're a real smart person, you don't think you're that smart. But when you're not that
[00:17:25] smart, you think you're smart. Oh, yeah, 100% of the country. We had these, we had these
[00:17:32] forms that we used to make the leaders in the seal platoons fill out. And they would rank themselves.
[00:17:36] One, you know, one being the lowest score, five being the highest score. And they'd grade themselves
[00:17:41] on whatever 10, 15 different items, tactical knowledge, ability to lead, understanding of the troops,
[00:17:51] understanding of the tactics, and they had to grade themselves on everything. And 100% of the time,
[00:17:57] 100% of the time, I don't make that claim very often. 100% of the time. The guys that
[00:18:04] graded them, the guys that were really good, really good leaders and really stepped up and really
[00:18:08] doing a great job, they'd give themselves a grade. Their grade average would be like a solid
[00:18:14] 2.7. Okay. Oh, you know, I could get better at this and I could do better here. The guys that were
[00:18:22] not good, they were not good leaders. And their latines were struggling. Literally, their grade average
[00:18:29] would be 5.0. They would give themselves a 5 and everything. Their self, that's, you know,
[00:18:36] arrogance just completely crushes your ability to do a self assessment. Yeah. Unbelievable. Interesting.
[00:18:45] Back to the book, back at the platoon base, I busied myself learning more about the tactical position
[00:18:51] and the personality of the men. There was a distance between us in those first hours. I was not sure
[00:18:59] of their soldierliness and they were not sure of my leadership. Fair enough, little, little, mutual
[00:19:05] assessment going on right there. Now they're out on a patrol and there's one of the, one of
[00:19:16] the guys spots a guy named Dunn. He spots somebody and he sort of gets ready to do engage. And
[00:19:26] McDonald says, what are you doing? And the sergeants reply was short VC. Me and these are V.
[00:19:36] A. Kong. He says, I felt it was time for me to assert myself. I would not allow the squad to fire.
[00:19:44] I did not see any weapons and regardless of the political leanings of the older man,
[00:19:49] the boy to my way of thinking deserved a little more consideration. Hold off. I said to
[00:19:54] Dunn. His looks spoke a thousand words. He wasn't accustomed to being second guest. Not only
[00:20:00] he had, he'd been a squad leader. He'd been leading the entire platoon. And the reason he says that
[00:20:05] is because in the, the, the old platoon commander who was weak and was hiding. This guy Dunn was out there
[00:20:12] making stuff happen. And now I was challenging him. My decision was made and I couldn't back away.
[00:20:18] If I relinquish my command, the squad would open fire both of the man and the boy was good as dead.
[00:20:23] Maybe Dunn was right. What did I know? I was a newcomer. If I let him give orders the consequences
[00:20:29] were his. If I gave orders, they were mine. No, I decided. Either way, the consequences were mine.
[00:20:38] I was the senior man. Even if I looked the other way, I would have sanctioned the killing.
[00:20:44] I stared back at Dunn. So, he's taking ownership. One might even say he's taking extreme ownership
[00:20:52] of the situation. And despite even if the other guy makes a decision, he owns it because he's the
[00:20:57] senior guy out there. Now they're continuing. So, they let those guys live. And now they're continuing
[00:21:07] the patrol and back to the book. I sensed a slight pull on my right foot and pivoting to my left.
[00:21:16] I took a broad step. The roaring in my ear was tremendous. As if in a dream, I began floating
[00:21:25] in the direction of my last step. It was still a warm, beautiful, clear day. Yet somehow,
[00:21:31] I didn't seem to be there anymore. I was going off into a deep sleep, although my eyes were wide
[00:21:37] open. And I could see the soldiers in front of me exactly as they had been a moment ago.
[00:21:42] I continued to float. How graceful I felt. Sensing everything in slow motion, I saw the ground rising
[00:21:49] to meet my chest. What a perfect landing it was. The ground sliding up underneath me.
[00:21:56] Then I heard, then I rose again, rebounding from the impact and the billows of soft,
[00:22:01] fine dust particles. Again, I eased down into the dirt, sending a second thicker cloud of
[00:22:08] brown debris rising around my face and outstretched hands. A abruptly, the pace of my thoughts
[00:22:15] quickened as the surrealistic effects left. My God, we've been hit. Then the pace increased to normal.
[00:22:24] Oh no, it's me. I felt sick to my stomach. I thought I would vomit. And I made my first deliberate
[00:22:30] movement since the explosion had gone off in my ear. From my prone position, I jerked my head to the
[00:22:36] left and gaped at my legs. Oh be there. Please be there. They were there bleeding in torn, but they were there.
[00:22:47] I was so happy I wanted to shout with joy. I was euphoric. So he's walking and hits a booby drop.
[00:22:57] That description is eerily similar to Jodi Middix's description of getting blown up.
[00:23:08] And yeah, I mean, this McDonald ended up in a little bit better situation in the fact that he
[00:23:14] kept his legs, but Jodi, the way Jodi describes that in his books, very similar, you know, just boom
[00:23:21] and horrible situation. Back to the book, a wounded leader is still a leader. Unless so incapacitated,
[00:23:33] he can't make decisions. I wasn't that bad off and I found it somewhat consoling to assert myself
[00:23:38] as the man in charge. At the very least, it staved off the shock that would come later.
[00:23:44] So they get them out of there and he's on a stretcher anyways, lying naked on a
[00:23:51] stretcher suspended between two chairs. I began to suffer the first sensations of shock.
[00:23:56] I began to shake so severely and I thought once again, I was going to vomit. I was also afraid
[00:24:04] of defecating where I lay. I was so overcome with self-pity that for a second, I caught myself
[00:24:11] starting to shed a tear. The morphine was having its effect and I was not in full control of my emotions.
[00:24:17] More than anything I was scared. I was no longer afraid I would die. I was afraid because I could have
[00:24:24] died. My heart was racing. My body trembling. The ringing in my ear confused. My drug thinking
[00:24:32] even more. And I couldn't focus my thoughts. I only knew I had completely failed in my first attempt
[00:24:40] to lead a combat action. The West pointer, the paratrooper, the Ranger. He had lasted less than 48 hours,
[00:24:49] blown up by his own blundering footwork and ill-considered decisions. How in glorious it all seemed,
[00:24:57] lying there in my nakedness. To use on the ground for 48 hours and this happens, go in, take over the
[00:25:05] platoon, call in the other guy, a coward basically goes out on his, I think this was his third patrol.
[00:25:12] He had done two other patrols, nothing happened on those other patrols and then boom, gets blown up.
[00:25:21] Now he's in the hospital. Four other wounded soldiers came aboard. One was gut shot and about four
[00:25:29] inches of his stomach or poking out of his middle. He shielded his wounds with his hands as he walked
[00:25:35] out to the chopper. One American armored cavalry platoon had just been ambushed in the 506 valley,
[00:25:44] south of Bondson. And nine bloated and charred, but still alive soldiers were brought in and placed next
[00:25:52] to me. They smelled awful and their pain was excruciating. Mercifully, some were unconscious,
[00:25:59] but those awake were screaming. The violent shaking I had experienced at the LZ English was rampant
[00:26:06] among the group. I was grateful to be an infantryman. I wouldn't want to travel in gasoline,
[00:26:14] fed machines that invariably exploded and burned when hit. A Vietnamese soldier had been brought in
[00:26:23] and placed ahead of me, signifying the greater severity of his wounds. He too had been gut shot,
[00:26:30] and apparently his stomach and intestines had completely spilled out. His stomach lay quite exposed,
[00:26:37] but his intestines still attached had been dumped into a sandbag which was tied securely to his
[00:26:44] thigh. When he was brought in, he was unconscious, but after a while he came to, I saw him lift his head
[00:26:52] and stare at the sandbag. What he saw made him pass out again. The cycle of coming to,
[00:26:59] looking at his intestines and passing out was repeated three times. On the last go around,
[00:27:05] he must have died for he was abruptly removed from line and taken away from the operating room.
[00:27:15] He doesn't matter what war it is. He goes into that hospital with a bringing in those wounded soldiers
[00:27:20] and it's groovy. He gets luckily his wounds weren't that bad. He gets healed up a few weeks
[00:27:36] and goes back, right back into it, right back into it, right back into it.
[00:27:43] And here they're going out on patrol and I mean, think about that. He got blown up. He's there for
[00:27:53] 48 hours. He gets blown up. He gets sent to the hospital for three weeks. He heals up. I mean,
[00:27:59] you might as well have died when you step on an ID. Just this matters and how big it was.
[00:28:04] And this one obviously wasn't big enough to kill him, but if it would have been a little bit bigger,
[00:28:08] he'd be dead. Or if a strap and a went in the wrong spot, he'd be dead. Or if he's standing a
[00:28:12] little bit closer to you, he'd be dead. Or if whatever, they didn't get him out in time,
[00:28:17] he'd be dead. If it had a vein, he'd be dead. If it had an artery, he'd be dead. So he knows that.
[00:28:22] And guess what? Doesn't matter. Giddy up, go back out there. You're back in the game. And here we go.
[00:28:29] They're going out on patrol. I placed myself fourth in the order of marches. We slid out the wire.
[00:28:36] The first 50 yards were tolerable. But as we left the relative security of the perimeter,
[00:28:42] further and further behind, I began to dread that each footstep would land me on another booby trap.
[00:28:49] I tried not to think about my wounds and the mayhem and gore I'd seen during the past few weeks,
[00:28:55] but the more I tried to forget the more clearly I remembered. If I was going to die,
[00:29:01] and I began to grieve for myself, for my wife, for the little boy who would never really know his father,
[00:29:09] sweat poured from my forehead, my back, my every joint. My stomach was as tight as a knot.
[00:29:17] Each step felt as if it might paralyze me. I tried hard to feel my leg, so I would remember them
[00:29:27] long after they were blown off. I was torturing myself. Then I realized that the other men must be
[00:29:36] afraid too, yet they kept moving. I was their leader. I had been trained for my job in the best
[00:29:44] installations in the US Army had to offer West Point Airborne School Ranger School Jungle War Fair
[00:29:52] School. How could I be deficient after such an investment? While my men wrenched from unmilitary
[00:30:00] backgrounds into the Army and quickly processed in an impersonal training facilities continued
[00:30:05] to do their duty. Somehow I kept moving. I could not allow myself to appear cowardly in the
[00:30:12] eyes of those men besides there was no place else to go. That IED Booby trap threat is just horrifying.
[00:30:33] And it's scary enough for just being over there when you see the destruction that it causes,
[00:30:38] but getting blown up and actually personally stepping on ID and then you're back in the field
[00:30:44] three weeks later. In the same area patrolling the same ground. That's courage.
[00:30:55] Now is there moving into position on an ambush site. He's getting some stuff from his gear
[00:31:04] and here we go back to the book. As I struggled through the undergrowth, the lace called on a branch
[00:31:09] and pulled the compass loose from its birth, causing it to fall in the ground where it struck a rock.
[00:31:17] The metallic case made a loud ping as it bounced. Without hesitation, I yelled Booby trap.
[00:31:24] Lurch to the right through myself to the ground, covered my head with my arms and tried to pull
[00:31:33] my legs up to my button, bracefully explosion that was about to rip me apart.
[00:31:41] And all the other guys are doing the same thing, diving for cover.
[00:31:45] So if you didn't catch that, he was just moving through the brush and something caught on his
[00:31:51] compass and pulled it out of its pocket and it fell to the ground and he heard that metallic noise
[00:31:56] and he yelled out. I mean, they're on patrol. They're setting up an ambush. So this will be quiet and
[00:32:00] tactical and silent and all of a sudden he's yelling out. Booby trap and diving to the ground.
[00:32:04] It makes everyone take cover. So they come back from that and he says, I took the time to debrief
[00:32:14] the patoon upon reentry to the perimeter, pointing out the strong points and the weak points of the
[00:32:19] night's actions. I did not spare myself in the critique. I simply stated what had happened.
[00:32:27] I had made a mistake but an honest one. There were a few subdued comments by the patrol members,
[00:32:33] all of whom clearly recognized the danger of my action. It didn't matter. I had overcome my fear.
[00:32:40] I was once again in control of my patoon and more importantly, myself. So when you make a
[00:32:45] mistake on it, that's what you got to do when you make a mistake on it. Back to the book. My indoctrination
[00:32:55] period was over. I had been bludded but survived. I had been embarrassed but would recover.
[00:33:02] The early shocks had been merciful in that they were over quickly. I could now turn my attention away
[00:33:08] from the self-conscious concerns of how I would fit into this alien environment and how I might
[00:33:14] be perceived by the soldiers I led. I could concentrate instead upon improving my style of leadership
[00:33:21] and fighting the enemy. There was much to do. For too long, the patoon had done only those things
[00:33:29] necessary to minimize casualties and approach that in the long run would surely lead to maximum
[00:33:37] casualties. So you want to sit back, you want to hide, you're letting the enemy get a drop on you.
[00:33:47] And he knows that. You got to take some risk upfront to prevent the long-term extreme risk.
[00:33:57] Back to the book. An old army added claims that soldiers only do well that which their commander checks
[00:34:04] and combat everything must be done well. Yet I realized I couldn't possibly check everything.
[00:34:12] But I could create the illusion that everything was being checked especially if I use the
[00:34:18] squad leaders and the patoon sergeants as extensions of my own will. So a little bit of decentralized
[00:34:27] commander. He knows he can't inspect everything. He can't be everywhere all the time. But if he uses
[00:34:34] proper decentralized command, he can make it happen. Because his leaders, his subordinate leaders,
[00:34:39] will make it happen. Back to the book, not only tactics, but all matters relevant to our life
[00:34:47] in the field had to be supervised. For instance, health habits had to be inspected as diligently
[00:34:53] as weapons were. Soldiers have to be kept clean. They have to shave and watch, wash, and the
[00:34:59] squad leader has to see that they do. Soldiers need a place to relieve themselves, a place secure from
[00:35:05] both enemy and the disease. Messic women has to be kept clean and soldiers need a balanced diet.
[00:35:12] Feet must be cared for. A squad leader is accountable for the changing of socks as he is for the
[00:35:18] cleaning of weapons. Men on alert must stay awake no matter how exhausting the preceding hours
[00:35:25] have been. Radios have to be monitored, kept dried, and supplied with fresh batteries.
[00:35:30] Proper communication procedures must be maintained. Coads must not be compromised.
[00:35:36] Positions must be constantly improved. The claymore minds have to be checked,
[00:35:40] camouflage, and recamouflaged. Trenches have to be deepened. Firing positions must be made
[00:35:45] more lethal to the enemy. Artillery fires must be registered and re-registered.
[00:35:50] Grasadiation to the wire must be kept cut. The ammunition bunker has to be kept dry.
[00:35:54] Soldiers must rehearse in all combat situations that may be expected of them.
[00:36:00] The functioning of the chain of command must be clearly understood by all the men.
[00:36:04] In combat, leaders are quickly attrided, and every man in his turn must be prepared to take over the
[00:36:10] mission. Lot of stuff to handle. That's why he's saying he can't do all that himself.
[00:36:17] You have to use decentralized command in these situations.
[00:36:23] Back to the book, I checked positions at night. Every night. I lay behind the machine guns
[00:36:29] of the men in the strong points. I checked the frequency of the radio carried by the RTO.
[00:36:34] I ate my e-mails at irregular hours, sometimes alone, sometimes with a group of soldiers.
[00:36:40] I sat and listened to the men. I studied their manner of speech, their gate. The fact that they
[00:36:46] were left or right handed. How soundly they slept. How well they saw in the dark.
[00:36:53] I listened to their stories, their hopes, their gripes. I tried not to speak about myself.
[00:37:00] They're concerned about me. Was whether or not I could get them through their tour.
[00:37:06] They might want to tell me about their homes and their families, but they wanted me to listen,
[00:37:11] not talk. They did not want to know about my life away from Vietnam.
[00:37:16] I was an officer, and their eyes that made me different. I was a part of this war.
[00:37:24] I was one of the they. They drafted the soldier. They trained him. They ordered him to this
[00:37:35] god for sake in place, and they sent him out on terrifying missions to be maimed and killed.
[00:37:42] They did not have a life other than the army. They were the army.
[00:37:49] So I listened and I watched. These men were the prime resource of the platoon.
[00:38:01] They would fulfill its missions. They would do their countries bidding.
[00:38:05] But they were men first. They were not so many boots on parade. They were human.
[00:38:13] They had loves, fears, futures that they hoped to see. They made me wonder.
[00:38:22] Was I coming to know them too well to make them do what they had to do?
[00:38:28] Or did I not know them well enough to ask them to do it?
[00:38:32] I say that all the time. That's one of the misconceptions about the military.
[00:38:42] Is that the people that are in the military are people, they're humans.
[00:38:50] Not so many boots on parade.
[00:38:53] Now he talks a little bit about the enemy. The enemy were also young, also adherents of a
[00:39:04] humanistic faith in which killing was not the essence of life. Yet now we face each other.
[00:39:13] Obsessed with the idea of killing each other. There was no respite from it.
[00:39:19] Once a day I wrote a letter to my wife. It was a moment of sanity snatched from the madness of war.
[00:39:28] If anything, my thoughts of home reinforced my desire to stay alive and my determination to keep the
[00:39:33] enemy from killing me. They would not kill me. They would not kill my men. We would kill them first.
[00:39:41] War is the management of violence claimed the contemporary social scientists and military
[00:39:50] strategists as we hacked our way through the struggle of Vietnam. For us, violence was killing.
[00:39:58] There was no management involved. People were either dead or they were not.
[00:40:04] I could not manage my platoon up a hill. I had to lead them up there. I had a mission to accomplish
[00:40:15] and I had men to keep alive as many as I could. I had to do more than keep them alive. I had to
[00:40:23] preserve their human dignity. I was making them kill. Forcing them to commit the most uncivilized
[00:40:31] of acts. But at the same time, I had to keep them civilized. That was my duty as their leader.
[00:40:40] They were good men, but they were facing death. And men facing death can forgive themselves
[00:40:47] many things. War gives the appearance of condoning almost everything, but men must live with their
[00:40:55] actions for a long time afterward. A leader has to help them understand that. There are lines.
[00:41:04] They must not cross. He is their linked normalcy to order to humanity.
[00:41:12] If the leader loses his own sense of propriety or shrink from his duty, anything will be allowed,
[00:41:20] and anything can happen. Some men in combat will commit war crimes. Just as some men in combat
[00:41:27] will fail to take care of themselves. They will experiment with drugs, steel property, abuse,
[00:41:33] women. When this happens, it destroys the discipline of a unit making it easier for others to follow suit.
[00:41:42] War is at its very core, the absence of order. And the absence of order leads to very easily
[00:41:50] to the absence of morality, unless the leader can preserve each of them in its place.
[00:41:56] The leader has to set the standards from morality as clearly as he sets the standards for
[00:42:01] personal hygiene or weapons maintenance. He must allow no cutting of corners.
[00:42:08] A bottle of soda stolen from an old peasant woman leads gradually but directly to the rape of her
[00:42:14] daughter if the line is not drawn in the beginning. There's a lot of dichotomy in there.
[00:42:26] And this is what I've talked about before. I was making them kill, forcing them to commit the most
[00:42:32] in civil-uncivilized of acts, but at the same time, I had to keep them civilized.
[00:42:37] And you know another one that I talk about all the time is the fact that you care about your men
[00:42:52] more than anything. And yet you have to send them out on missions where they can be
[00:43:00] gravely wounded or killed. And so this is what a combat leader is struggling with. This is the
[00:43:07] dichotomy of leadership. This was war. This Vietnam involvement and in war, things tend to happen.
[00:43:21] But the commander was the link to order and civility and he had to be humane.
[00:43:26] At the same time, he had to be uncompromising to protect the lives of all. The job was not easy.
[00:43:40] The job was not easy. No sir, it was not.
[00:43:44] Now he goes into a chapter that's called a cast of characters where he's describing some of the people
[00:43:58] in the Paltoon. Who were the sons that America sent to war? In vain, I looked for the
[00:44:08] article Platoon of Romantic fiction. The kid from Brooklyn wasn't there. The Incipant Poet never
[00:44:21] made it. The rich mama's boy out to prove his manhood stayed home. As a cross section of America's
[00:44:29] youth, the Platoon was a complete failure. So all these typical characters that you see in the movies
[00:44:36] and this idea that it's a cross section of America, no, it wasn't. The military draft was never
[00:44:44] concerned with equity. Its sole purpose was to obtain the required numbers of men with sufficient
[00:44:49] mental and physical qualities to do the job. Since the pool of men from which to draw was much greater
[00:44:56] than the numbers needed, a natural selection process allowed the educated and the privilege to
[00:45:01] avoid the draft altogether. The selection process continued for the unfortunate drafted so that
[00:45:09] those with some education or particular skills would be devoted from combat service.
[00:45:17] Even among those who made it to Vietnam, the vast majority never saw combat.
[00:45:23] Only those without skill, without schooling, and without friends, or whose or who were
[00:45:29] obstinate in the face of ceaseless, proselytizing against their obligation to serve, made it to the
[00:45:36] field. And they knew it. Talking about some of the guys here, he's got
[00:45:48] guy named Jim Barnes from Asheville, North Carolina who is
[00:45:52] good solid operator, got a really bad stutter. Guy named Corp. John Killigan from Baker's field,
[00:46:04] California, and he sort of is the throughout the book. He's a guy that is sort of the
[00:46:11] model soldier. And he's 22 years old already on his third tour of duty in Vietnam. And by the way,
[00:46:20] a tour in Vietnam was a year long. So this guy's so killigan's on his third tour in Vietnam,
[00:46:25] most combat experience soldier in the book, too, and everyone respected him. But no one considered
[00:46:32] him a friend. The reason was simple why he was so well respected, he was the best soldier among us.
[00:46:40] He had the reflexes of a cat. He was a deadly shot and ferocious in a fight. And he never showed
[00:46:46] the slightest bit of concern for his own safety. Awesome. There were so many ways to avoid
[00:46:59] ending up as a combat infantryman. There were so many of their countrymen who would never
[00:47:05] see an all-of-drab uniform or a drill sergeant or the green hell of Vietnam. But each of these
[00:47:12] men seemed destined to end up there as if it had been written in granite on the day of his birth.
[00:47:22] They did not complain. This is what those guys live with a little bit.
[00:47:31] I noticed one day that specialist Barnes turned away when one particularly beautiful girl
[00:47:36] walked close to biome as he was clearing a thicket of underbrush away from the wire. The girl's
[00:47:43] left arm was missing. Her empty sleeve folded neatly and pinned to her shoulder.
[00:47:50] What's the matter Barnes I asked? In his painstakingly slow stutter, Barnes explained that the girl in
[00:47:57] her lover were among a group of armed vehicles who walked through one of our ambushes one night.
[00:48:02] The ambush was sprung. The boyfriend was killed and the girl's arm was mangled by a bullet.
[00:48:11] The girl was evacuated by the Americans but her arm could not be saved.
[00:48:16] Eventually she returned to work her fields. What do you say to a girl whose arm you shot off?
[00:48:25] Barnes asked me, his stutter clearing for a minute. I could think of no reply.
[00:48:35] Now, there's starting to get some intelligence report that there's
[00:48:40] ominous forecast that there's going to be some big attacks, some big enemy thrusts,
[00:48:45] and he's taking some time to prepare for that.
[00:48:48] My targets for improvement were discipline and tactics. The two are closely related. In the heat of
[00:48:58] battle there is no time for second guessing the per commander and is necessary for a soldier to
[00:49:03] develop an automatic response to an order. Such instantaneous obedience will overcome all fears,
[00:49:09] all confusion, all inclinations towards self preservation. It is the result of unmedicated daily
[00:49:16] discipline in all things, from taking the daily malaria pill to shaving each day to attacking in the
[00:49:24] face of an automatic weapon. I'm adding this to my life, the statement of unmedicated daily discipline
[00:49:37] in all things. They're heading out on a patrol and as McDonald heads up the line to inspect some
[00:49:50] of the soldiers, here we go to the book. Suddenly there was a hollow sounding explosion in a whistling
[00:49:56] past my ear followed by another explosion a second later about 150 meters out in the bushes.
[00:50:02] I spun around to see King, one of the guys, King with a sneer on his face. Sorry, L.T.
[00:50:10] the words his from his mouth. I dropped my weapon. The grenade launcher dangled from his right hand,
[00:50:18] a waft of smoke curling up from the barrel. It was clear that he had fired his 40 millimeter round at
[00:50:26] me. At that range, he could not have missed, so he must have meant it as a warning. He was telling
[00:50:33] me he did not like my attitude. So he got McDonald who's been imposing discipline and trying
[00:50:38] to keep the guy squared away and this guy doesn't like it. And so he sends him a warning shot with
[00:50:44] his with his M79 grenade launcher. I was scared, but I was angry too. King had not only threatened
[00:50:53] my life, but my authority as well. A few weeks earlier, I might have been overcome by the situation,
[00:50:58] but since then I had developed a thick skin necessary for survival in Vietnam. With murder in my eyes,
[00:51:05] I looked into King's face. Slowly, deliberately, I walked up to him saying nothing until I was
[00:51:11] close enough to touch him. I had made no threatening gesture. Suddenly, when I was close enough
[00:51:17] to smell his breath, I flicked my M16 in fire position and placed the muzzle of the weapon
[00:51:23] in the cavity of the underside of his chin. He went up on his toes as I increased the pressure of the
[00:51:29] rifle barrel, lifting him up against the bottom of his head. The sneer was now on my face,
[00:51:36] as I raised my voice, so everyone could hear you son of a bitch. The eyes of everyone in the
[00:51:43] pitoon were riveted on us. Drop your weapon again and you better pray to God, it hits me square in
[00:51:49] the back because if it doesn't, you bastard, I'll blow your brains to kingdom come.
[00:51:57] Not a man stirred, putting down a little rebellion. But again, this is something we...
[00:52:07] Well, you knew you think about that. I mean, from my perspective, nothing like that ever came close
[00:52:11] to happening me at any time. Was there any time where I ever thought any of my guys would do
[00:52:18] anything in any way to hurt me in any situation? In fact, those guys would do anything to save me.
[00:52:24] They would never let anything happen to me. And here you have one of your guys that just decides
[00:52:28] it's going to give you a warning shot with a 40 millimeter grenade launcher. Because he doesn't like
[00:52:32] here added to whatever. They're probably not allowed to do with a lot of those guys didn't want to be there.
[00:52:40] Absolutely. Absolutely.
[00:52:42] Now they are moving forward on the patrol. They had a little incident happen.
[00:52:56] And they find a corpse from the book now. I was becoming fairly accustomed of viewing the
[00:53:04] dead, but this cadavir was particularly grotesque. It was the old woman who had cared for the children.
[00:53:10] Both her breasts had been half severed from her body, a deliberate cut made on the underside of each.
[00:53:18] Each palm in the soul of each foot had been shot through with a small caliber round.
[00:53:23] The killing wound, which no doubt had followed the earlier torturous wounds was a blast from a
[00:53:29] weapon evidently placed inside her mouth and directed out the back of her head.
[00:53:34] Her eyes were open, transfixed and terror. Jabbed into her belly on the end of a straight and
[00:53:42] safety pin was a note. Nand the kit Carson scout translated it for me.
[00:53:51] To one cow key has been found guilty by the people's court of aiding the American
[00:53:56] imperialists and their suppression of the Vietnamese people. As an enemy of the people,
[00:54:02] she has been made to pay for her crimes. This is the justice that will be brought to all who
[00:54:07] consort with the Americans and aid them in the villainous suppression of our land.
[00:54:15] War is hell.
[00:54:21] Now, they start to get
[00:54:25] attacked inside their perimeter. Then here we go. At that moment, the first rush was made by the enemy.
[00:54:36] 20 to 30 V at Kong appeared coming at the South Wired Dead Run. I shouted for my men to
[00:54:43] shift fire on them. There was no need for my words. My men were responding well. We were getting off
[00:54:49] a handheld flare every 30 seconds which illuminated the rushing enemy very clearly. The two machine
[00:54:56] guns on that portion of our perimeter barked out of welcome and neat six round bursts. Several of
[00:55:02] the enemy fell. Their first rush was stopped in its tracks. It was becoming increasingly clear
[00:55:11] that the machine gun was going to be the key weapon in the initial stoppage of the fight.
[00:55:15] And I just highlighted that because I know I get a I hear from military guys all the time.
[00:55:22] Guys that are overseas and I just wanted to reiterate that. In the fire fight, the machine gun
[00:55:29] is the key weapon. Now they're continuing to being attacked and from the southeast of
[00:55:39] woman came running toward the break in the wire. She was carrying a bulky object in her arms
[00:55:44] but in the flickering light of the flares it was impossible to identify it. Don't fire Lawrence
[00:55:49] barked. I was not sure I agreed. If it was a satchel charge that the woman was carrying
[00:55:55] she would be able to fling it in and us in another few steps. The explosion would rip apart that
[00:56:00] perimeter wide open allowing the enemy to rush through unimpeded. On the other hand if the woman
[00:56:07] was seeking help it would be a tragedy to cut her down. As I hesitated the heavy beat of enemy
[00:56:14] rounds forced her down. Lawrence made a dash for the wire. Got 10 steps and then went into a low
[00:56:20] crawl. Inching is way along. He made it to a break in the wire and came up to the woman.
[00:56:25] In her arms was her seven-year-old daughter. The little girl had taken around clean through the
[00:56:29] chest along was collapsed and she was bleeding heavily. Her mother was trying to make it to us to save
[00:56:37] the child. Again this is the dichotomy of war. You got people torturing and murdering
[00:56:48] old women and then you get this situation where there's a woman who's rushing the perimeter
[00:56:53] and this guy says she's don't shoot her and then crawls out. Rises life to go and try and find out
[00:57:00] what the situation is and help her. There's darkness and there's light. They beat back that attack
[00:57:16] and the next morning they go out on patrol. Killigan was the point man on the first patrol
[00:57:22] out the morning after the fight. All night he'd worked the machine gun from the southern tip of
[00:57:26] the platoon triangle. His steady hand holding the enemy rushes at bay. Early in the fight the
[00:57:33] attackers had recognized Killigan's prowess and tried their best to put him out of action.
[00:57:38] The sound, the sandbags surrounding his position were torn and poked from the bullets and
[00:57:43] shrapnel aimed at his early retirement. He had not flinched throughout the night.
[00:57:49] Now he took up the point with the alertness of a well-rested cat. The man seemed indestructible.
[00:58:05] Now he starts talking a little bit about the situation that they were in and some moves that he
[00:58:11] made and one of the things he did was he kept his forces together at this point when they'd been
[00:58:15] attacked or he reunited his forces and he talks about that here. Had the enemy struck while my
[00:58:20] meager forces were split, they might have overwhelmed one or both elements piecemeal.
[00:58:27] Controlling the separated elements would also have been almost impossible and the subsequent
[00:58:33] coordination of outside support such as air strike and armor platoon would have been too hazardous
[00:58:39] had we even survived long enough to receive help. So he's talking about again this is just going
[00:58:43] out to people that are in the military in the field. Avoid splitting your forces up. Just avoid
[00:58:50] something you obviously have to do it but always think about it. Think about the ramifications of it.
[00:58:56] When you're split up, number one, you're two elements are weak. That's why when you do split up,
[00:59:00] you should stay as often as you can stay within position of mutual support. Where your weapons
[00:59:04] can support the other group and you can bring them back to your perimeter or you can attack or
[00:59:08] you can flank or you can support them. The other thing that's very difficult when you're split up
[00:59:12] is it's very difficult to control what's happening. Because you likely out of verbal range,
[00:59:18] you know, could possibly be out of radio range and now now how you can control what's going to
[00:59:22] happen. So if you do have to split up, make sure you have very good loss of communication plans
[00:59:27] to react to. If something happens, we're going to go to this master point. Here's going to be
[00:59:31] the signaling when you come in there. So you've got to think about that. And finally, when you split
[00:59:35] your forces up on the battlefield and you lose control of them. Now you can't call for air support.
[00:59:40] You can't, it's very difficult to get help and bring the funder that you would want to because you
[00:59:46] don't know where everybody is. So when you do have to split for, so what you do absolutely have to
[00:59:50] do sometimes avoid it as much you can. And then when you have to plan for the worst case scenario.
[00:59:55] So that you're ready for it. Now they're back to kind of sorting things out after this
[01:00:04] hardcore battle when they, when the VC attacked. My eyes returned to the bodies laying so lying
[01:00:11] so neatly in line. Why did we line them up anyways? Was it a pension for neatness and attempt to
[01:00:19] bring some orderlyness to the disorder of death? It was so absurd. I remembered reading somewhere
[01:00:27] that in World War II the Germans had lined up the bodies of American prisoners they'd massacred.
[01:00:32] Disorder and order, barbarity and civility. Civility. Ironic juxtapositions in the affairs of
[01:00:42] men, again, we're just talking about dichotomy of war. Myelation was reduced to a sense of
[01:00:49] insignificance by the cold, brown look of the corpses sprawled in the bright sunlight. A few hours
[01:00:57] ago each one had been a dynamo of a human spirit, hope, and ambition. Now they were still their
[01:01:04] motion frozen at least in that last instant of life as if making a mockery of the final effort.
[01:01:15] They had become meaningless clumps of earth forever in an animate, no more significant than the
[01:01:21] rocks lying to their left and right. How fickle those human ambitions now seemed, how pointless
[01:01:28] those concerns. And just as the bodies had become part of the earth on which they rested,
[01:01:35] so I had passed during the battle from being in the war to being part of the war.
[01:01:53] Continuing on, the fog of war is pervasive. As vigilant as I tried to be, I knew it was only a
[01:02:00] matter of time before a mistake was made. There were six squads to control as well as the armored
[01:02:06] cavalry puttune and the still dischointed RF gaggle. Moreover, Vietnamese regular army units were
[01:02:13] infringing on my area. As puttune leader, I had the problems of the rich. Too many resources to
[01:02:21] coordinate in a limited area of operations. The ingredients for a tragedy were brewing, and so he had
[01:02:28] been augmented with some cavalry guys, with more potuctions, or sorry, more squads to help
[01:02:33] mounts. And now he's got a bunch of people there. He had 30 before. Now he's got a lot more.
[01:02:40] And there's patrols or happening. Things are going on. And we start getting a call of potential
[01:02:49] enemy out and outside the wire. And he's checking his map. And he's going back and forth on the
[01:02:58] radio. Hey, is that we have any friendlies in that location. Nope. No friendlies there. Check with
[01:03:01] the other guys. Nope. We had no friendlies there. So no one's in that area. No. There's no
[01:03:05] friendlies in that area. Okay. God, he's checking his map. He's going back and forth. And now we go
[01:03:09] back to the book. All checks had been made. The squads still had the moving element in sight. The
[01:03:16] decision was now mine. Take them under fire with the sniper. Then open up, shoot to kill.
[01:03:23] The last statement seemed pointless. We always shot to kill, but it reflected my troubled
[01:03:29] thoughts over the risk I was taking. The enemy just did not go that way. But no friendlies were
[01:03:36] reported anywhere near us. It had to be the enemy. So here's the one shot. The sniper go out.
[01:03:42] Then he hears massive gunfire go out. You can probably tell where this is heading.
[01:03:48] And then a phranic voice scream from my radio ceasefire. Sees fire. My God, you're killing us.
[01:03:56] I was horrified as I grabbed the handset and barked my order 2121. This is 26 ceasefire. Over.
[01:04:03] They had heard the original plea. And even as I spoke, the melee quieted.
[01:04:08] Again, the radio spoke. You sons of bitches. They're dead. They're dead.
[01:04:12] So in the confusion in the fog of war, they'd seen some guys. And obviously they turned out
[01:04:23] to be friendly. And they engaged them. Over the next 30 minutes, they get the debrief of what's
[01:04:29] happening. It was American advisor was out there with a Vietnamese platoon. One of his guys were dead
[01:04:35] and two were badly wounded. Then here's how he felt about that. I had ordered the execution
[01:04:45] of those men because the lieutenant advisor had made a mistake. By the way, they were 2,500
[01:04:50] meters off course. So they should not have been in that area. And when they were hearing,
[01:04:54] they were hearing on the radio. Hey, is there any friendlies out there? And they thought there's
[01:04:56] no way that anyone could be talking to us right now. But it happens. And a man should not be
[01:05:04] condemned to death for it. In war, however, the price from mistakes is deer and terribly final.
[01:05:13] Military leaders must weigh effects of their decisions carefully before because usually
[01:05:20] there is no turning back.
[01:05:21] That that blue on blue, that fratricide thing. It's a real thing. It's a real thing. I've lived
[01:05:34] through it myself. I've been in charge when it's happening. It's awful. And it's real.
[01:05:42] And so everybody that's out there that soldiers, Marines, special ops guys, train for that.
[01:05:51] Get that make yourselves, make your leadership. Make everyone as keen few as you can as what's
[01:05:56] happening so that you force yourselves to think and understand and over communicate where people are,
[01:06:04] what positions they're going to, what positions they're leaving, who's where on the battlefield.
[01:06:09] The fog of war is no joke.
[01:06:11] Now there's another attack that they that they pushed back and they kind of forward it early on by
[01:06:25] by catching someone that was going to, that was inside. There was going to try and get inside their
[01:06:32] compound. They catch that person. And here we go to the book. Their plan must have been to
[01:06:37] rupture our defense with a tremendous blast from the ammunition bunker and then rush it us from the
[01:06:41] eastern flank with the five sappers while we were still daysed. The sappers were armed only with
[01:06:49] fragmentation grenades. But they had plenty of them. Later we took 49 grenades from their bodies.
[01:06:56] One of the sappers, a young muscular man who in life would have epitomized the propaganda stereotypical
[01:07:02] revolutionary, but who in death appeared like so much wasted clay, was dressed only in a loincloth.
[01:07:12] Folded within that single article of clothing was a small piece of paper upon which was drawn
[01:07:17] or rough but accurate sketch of our perimeter defense. The first link in their plan had been
[01:07:24] destroyed by the capture of the infiltrator and was further deteriorated by the annihilation of the
[01:07:30] sapper force. But the vehicle were never noted for their flexibility and they continued to press
[01:07:37] forward according to their original plan. However, instead of meeting daysed, dying and demoralized
[01:07:43] defenders, the enemy rushed right into the protective fires of already enabled platoon.
[01:07:49] Because of a slight twist of fortune over which the vehicle had no influence, the attackers went to
[01:07:54] their death rather than the victory that night. This is the second time we've heard that,
[01:08:00] is just the the Viet Kong not being very flexible, not being very adaptable with their plan.
[01:08:08] So once again, if you're in a leadership position, you've got to maintain flexibility with
[01:08:14] your plan, whether you're in a combat operation or whether you're in a business world,
[01:08:18] it doesn't matter. Maintaining flexibility is absolutely paramount in from a leadership perspective,
[01:08:24] and from a team perspective. Now, after that attack, they move out to go for a counter attack,
[01:08:38] which is just, let's think about this. You're in your perimeter, you get attacked. They had a person
[01:08:45] that infiltrated and almost made it into the main ammo bunker that you have. They almost blew that up.
[01:08:52] And then their second thing was to have these the sappers, these soldiers crawling through the
[01:08:57] wire with 40 something grenades with them to go and jack stuff up. You push back, you repel this
[01:09:04] attack, and then guess what? The time for a counter attack. So here he is, as the back of the book,
[01:09:11] as the squad lined up for the exit through the wire, I looked at their young faces, tightened to
[01:09:15] stifle the fear building up inside their bodies. They were barely men, yet called upon by their
[01:09:22] country and abandoned by their more well-to-do peers, about to face a ruthless enemy who meant to
[01:09:28] put them in their early grave. No words of complaint from any of them. They were American infantry
[01:09:36] men, and would do the job they were asked to do. No matter what, no matter that it would not be
[01:09:43] appreciated. No matter that they would be condemned by their countrymen or at least the
[01:09:46] countrymen with the ability to wear with all to mold public opinion. Tonight they would do their duty.
[01:09:55] Though they were little more than boys, though they were frightened, though they were most
[01:10:00] not ready to die, they would do their duty. Most of them were labeled as coming from the lower social
[01:10:08] strata of American society, as if that were something in noble. I felt proud to be with them
[01:10:16] and glad to share their company. Their qualities of moral and physical courage of unselfice
[01:10:23] dedication to each other amid the difficult jobs they were called upon to do mark them in my mind
[01:10:30] as among the noblest of human beings. So they're out on this counterattack. I mean, what a great
[01:10:43] tribute to the American soldier. Unbelievable, unbelievable dedication and pride, unbelievable men.
[01:10:56] Now they, they're patrolling out in front of them. They hear some whispers and whispers out in
[01:11:07] front of them. We're either patrolling towards and they're trying to figure out what to do and it sounds
[01:11:13] like McDonald's Sorosant. Hey, let's just kill these guys. There's bad guys up ahead. We're
[01:11:20] out there whispering and kill again. Tugs of the Zarm and says, stay here. Like, I'm going to go
[01:11:27] check this out. He basically says, you know, we shouldn't, we shouldn't kill these people. And
[01:11:35] he McDonald gets kind of pissed because he's taking a look. This isn't the time for us to debate
[01:11:42] right now. I want to make a decision. And he says, kill again in one of his real moments of speech,
[01:11:52] he has to let me check it out first. So kill again doesn't talk much. He gets it done.
[01:11:59] So he creeps forward, you know, and he was basically saying, look, I'm going to go on alone.
[01:12:04] Like, are you just let me take my chances? I'm not putting anybody else at risk. Just me.
[01:12:09] And so he decides, okay, go ahead. You want to take you on a risk your life.
[01:12:14] And so he kill again disappears into the darkness and then a little while later he comes back.
[01:12:19] It's cool. And we'll go to the book here. Then it's quite easy. Crup to away.
[01:12:23] Kill again reappeared from the darkness. He crawled up to my face and said, it's okay. Let's move on.
[01:12:30] What were the voices? I asked. Family was his one more response.
[01:12:35] I passed the word to hold fire and the file began moving. We moved out of position and through
[01:12:41] the brush to our front. There huddled in a hole that must have been used as a household garbage dump.
[01:12:48] We're two aged women and old man, one young woman, and four tiny children.
[01:12:54] The elderly people had shy and bearous smiles on their faces. The children stared in sheer terror.
[01:13:01] Well, they might. I had nearly killed them all. The sight of the family was haunting.
[01:13:11] I and others like me are trained in commission to lead men into actions that determine life and death.
[01:13:19] Our authority, particularly on the field of battle, is virtually unquestioned.
[01:13:24] We were tasked to lead men like Kill again to tell them what should be done and what they must do.
[01:13:33] We have no obligation to listen to their point of view. Indeed, to do so,
[01:13:38] might be in itself or cause to occur a failure of leadership.
[01:13:45] And yet, the American soldier is often much more prepared than his leader to make a sound
[01:13:51] determination of what should be done. Kill again's approach had been wiser than mine.
[01:13:56] I was too preoccupied with my own safety and the safety of my men to consider that there might have
[01:14:01] been a non-combatant in the area. I had come to the most basic of battle field strategies.
[01:14:07] Shoot now and ask questions later. A thousand times I might have been able to rationalize that
[01:14:13] course of action after the fact. But I had gone, but had I gone ahead this time that people huddled
[01:14:20] now whole would have been dead, nothing but rotting corpses by the heat of the next day.
[01:14:25] That they were alive was no thanks to me. It was to kill again's credit.
[01:14:32] And he was just a quote, lowly American infantrymen.
[01:14:41] So once again, just credit to the trooper, to the soldier. And you can see there's this is
[01:14:48] some of the things that he talked about that we have no obligation to listen to that
[01:14:53] point of view. That's something that you can see he's maturing out of.
[01:14:58] And this paragraph is a visible evidence of him transitioning from, hey, look, I'm the boss.
[01:15:05] I'm in charge, do what I say to you know what, these guys know better than I do in many cases.
[01:15:10] And that's from a leadership perspective. That's a very important lesson to learn.
[01:15:14] And the soon you learn it the better off you're going to be. The people that you're leading
[01:15:18] oftentimes know the situation, the job, the technicalities better than you do.
[01:15:24] So rely on them, count on them, ask their opinion. And the fact of the matter is when you
[01:15:31] don't ask their opinion, it's only because you're insecure about your leadership, ability and your
[01:15:37] position. And by not asking, you actually, you actually develop less respect than if you say,
[01:15:50] hey, you know what, kill again? You've been here. This is your third-torn Vietnam. What do you
[01:15:55] think we should do here? You will not lose respect, leaders, you will not lose respect if you
[01:16:01] ask that question. In fact, you lose respect when you don't respect your frontline trooper,
[01:16:07] when you don't use their talent, when you don't take advantage of their expertise, that's when you go
[01:16:12] backwards. Listen to your troopers. So he gets, he gets pulled back to command. They assign
[01:16:30] him to like a mixed match unit of a bunch of random squads because they have a certain mission that
[01:16:37] they want him to do. And they've gone out and they've set up a perimeter. Now, if you don't know
[01:16:43] security perimeter, it's basically 360 degree security perimeter of where you're, you have guns pointed
[01:16:49] to the outside and you have usually the leadership will be in the center of the perimeter. And then
[01:16:54] we small teams kind of out in the perimeter making up the perimeter. So that's the position that
[01:16:58] they're in. He's got these random squads that he's never worked with before and he's in charge of them.
[01:17:04] Again, this is something where we did have to work with Iraq, he's on my last appointment, but oftentimes
[01:17:10] you're working with other seals. These guys, you know, guys, you know, I'm really well,
[01:17:14] you know everything they're going to do. And here you are, getting thrown into a combat environment
[01:17:17] on a very dangerous patrol into enemy territory that you don't know very well. And you've got a bunch
[01:17:21] of guys that you never worked with before. So as he's in that perimeter, he's given the guys some
[01:17:30] instructions about something called challenge and replies. So it's a way of confirming,
[01:17:36] because this is pitch black. These guys don't have night vision. It's pitch black. He says, hey,
[01:17:40] if you hear someone coming, you can issue the challenge for a number sum of 10, which is like,
[01:17:46] if I say echo, or if I hear you coming and I say seven, you would respond three. If I say four,
[01:17:52] you would respond six. So they've they've passed that word. If you hear noise, you need to challenge,
[01:17:57] do that challenge or reply. So he's out there and he's crawling towards one of the little
[01:18:02] elements on the outside of the perimeter so he can find out, you know, checking with them,
[01:18:06] see if they've seen anything, see if they heard anything. And here we go, back to the book.
[01:18:11] Shhh, was his only warning to the others. I came to a complete rest waiting for someone to issue
[01:18:19] the challenge. The seconds ticked on, but I heard no sound. I began to sense there was a problem.
[01:18:27] The next sound was the bolt and firing pin of a rifle sliding forward in response to a pulled
[01:18:33] trigger. Both fell forward on an empty chamber. Terrified, I realized that I should be dead,
[01:18:40] that the rifleman meant to nail me no questions asked. Only as earlier error and not having
[01:18:47] chambered around saved me. Don't shoot, I shouted in hard. It's the lieutenant.
[01:18:53] But I was too late to stop the momentum of events. I heard a panicky remark from the midst of the
[01:18:59] group, get the bastards, then around was chambered. As I flung myself at the sound, 15 feet
[01:19:06] is not far to sprint, but the journey seemed endless. I threw myself parallel to the ground
[01:19:12] and lunged in the dark figure appearing before my eyes. As I launched through the ear,
[01:19:17] I felt round switched by my outstretched body. Nine or ten bullets burning out of the barrel
[01:19:23] of the automatic weapon. My arms circled the knees of the fire or bringing him down in a heap.
[01:19:29] I pushed the hop barrel skyward as the last of the rounds exited the weapon.
[01:19:33] Although I had pinned the fire, I had also to think about the two other men with him. I yelled
[01:19:39] out, don't shoot, you son of a bitch, it's the platoon leader. There was no further firing.
[01:19:45] Fighting my rage, I tried to focus my thoughts. We were in deep trouble. Don't shoot, don't shoot.
[01:19:53] I hold your fire. I shouted across a perimeter. I could hear nervous chatter from all around,
[01:19:59] so he barely escaped. He gets the guys to stop. He doesn't even really, he's mad, but he's
[01:20:09] basically taking responsibility in being in this situation in the first place.
[01:20:15] So he says to the guys that were there. He says, I had modest all three men to challenge correctly,
[01:20:21] speaking to them as if I were giving a classroom instructions to a bunch of eager if not very
[01:20:26] bright students. I surprised myself with my calmness. It was when I moved back to my position that
[01:20:32] the greatest struggle within me began. Perhaps it was triggered by the decision I had to make
[01:20:38] by the book I shifted, I had shifted our positions. By the book I should have shifted our positions.
[01:20:46] We were reconnaissance patrol. We were badly outnumbered by the enemy and it compromised our position
[01:20:52] with all the shooting and shouting. There were good reasons for moving. On the other hand,
[01:20:58] it was pitch black night. If the enemy was close enough to get an immediate fix on us,
[01:21:04] he was close enough to hit us before we could move. Even if he wasn't close, further stumbling
[01:21:09] around in the darkness might worsen our predicament. Moreover, to affect the movement,
[01:21:16] I would have to move around to regroup the dispersed men. This was the point that weighed most
[01:21:21] heavily on my mind. I no longer had the heart for it. I had come within an inch of being killed,
[01:21:28] shot by one of my own men on the side of an ink black mountain in the middle of nowhere.
[01:21:33] I knew the men were ready to shoot anything that moved and I didn't want to give them a target.
[01:21:40] I should have been ashamed of myself. I was too afraid to move to implement rules,
[01:21:44] probably the best course of action for my men and my mission. I couldn't do it.
[01:21:48] Naked fear strips. Me of all shame or guilt. Fear was all I knew.
[01:21:56] And I didn't want to move. A few moments earlier, I had been an effective
[01:22:00] patoon leader doing his job. Now I could actually feel my chest throbbing against the dirt where I lay.
[01:22:07] I wanted to bury my face in my hands. I wanted to be like the little boy I used to be hiding
[01:22:11] from the darkness by putting his head under the covers. I could not think. My body began to tremble.
[01:22:18] Then shiver. Then shake uncontrollably. My God, I was going to die. I could not possibly live
[01:22:24] through the night. If anyone heard my breathing, I was sure you'd kill me. Death was everywhere.
[01:22:29] I sensed it. I felt that lying down beside me. I didn't want to die, but death was there.
[01:22:36] Cold and clammy, reaching for me with his icy touch. My pulse pounded in my ears and I felt nauseous.
[01:22:44] I almost threw up. The passing minutes, hours, whatever units of time exist in a nightmare brought
[01:22:52] no relief. The fear only worsened. I would not live through the night. I was sure of it.
[01:23:01] With the dying hurt, I wondered what I disappeared into nothingness.
[01:23:07] When I first went prone, trying to press myself into the ground, I fell close to an ant hill.
[01:23:12] A few of the ants scouts immediately began a reconnaissance of my body, but it was not until
[01:23:17] the ants' legions were called forward that I noticed them. As I lay, shaking on the ground,
[01:23:24] thousands of ants began trupping over me, adding to the crawling feeling on my flesh.
[01:23:31] Still, I did not move. For the move, I knew, would put me in the embrace of death. So I lay there
[01:23:37] where I was, heart pounding, skin sweating, ears throbbing, while an army of ants probed and
[01:23:43] pricked at my will.
[01:23:48] Sometime later, that night the rains came in a torrential downpour that sent a stream
[01:23:53] gushing down the mountainside at us. I still didn't move. My night of terror was not over yet,
[01:23:59] and when the rain stopped after a few hours, I still lay in the ooze and slime.
[01:24:04] The first light brought a sense of recovery. Darkness was ending, and I was still alive.
[01:24:13] Only then did the beating of my heart slow. I loosened my belt, reached down into the
[01:24:19] soggy elastic of my undershorts, and wiped out a streak of drowned ants.
[01:24:26] The rains had swept them over my body, where they had become trapped, and they had drowned.
[01:24:30] As I removed their dead bodies, thousands of them, I seemed to rid myself of my fixation with death.
[01:24:40] I had lived through the night, vulnerable as I was. The ants had died,
[01:24:46] eminently adaptable as they were. Somehow, the irony of it reassured me.
[01:24:52] One died when it was time to die. Apparently, it was not my time. As Dawn broke, I pulled
[01:25:04] myself together, gathered up my makeshift patrol, and moved back toward the Ranger camp.
[01:25:10] That night on the mountain, instead of engaging the enemy, I'd come to grips with my own mortality.
[01:25:17] That night, I had been a terrible, platoon leader. But perhaps I would be a better one thereafter
[01:25:26] because of it. A little bit of an intense evening, for Lieutenant McNona.
[01:25:37] Unbelievable. Now, he gets some, and throughout this book,
[01:25:45] there's, and I talked about this in the beginning, that there's rotations of guys.
[01:25:50] And guys are getting wounded. Guys at time, for them to go home, so you're constantly, he's constantly
[01:25:55] getting new troopers, new soldiers, new non-commission officers that are going to be the senior
[01:26:02] guys inside the platoon. And it's just a constant stream of incoming new guys, which again,
[01:26:09] is very foreign to me because in the sealed teams, we do very little of that. We do do it sometimes,
[01:26:14] for guy-graduates sealed training, and they happen to be assigned a team that's on deployment.
[01:26:20] They, they might come over and join us on deployment. It can't happen, but it's not, it's not the norm.
[01:26:28] So he's got a new guy that shows up who's a staff sergeant, an empallamman,
[01:26:34] and, and, pallamman's like almost 40 years old, he'd cross the Canadian board,
[01:26:39] the Canadian border, to join the Canadian army. And he'd spent time in the British army in
[01:26:50] Cyprus. He'd been chasing war, basically. And it's slightly under six feet tall, not an ounce of
[01:26:57] fat on his lean frame, determined look. And this is quite contrary to the guys he had been working with.
[01:27:04] And here he talks about that a little bit. With Hernandez and Robinson, I had to push to get them
[01:27:09] patrolling. With Pallaman, I had to hold him back. He believed firmly that the only good defense
[01:27:17] was a good offense. And he was ready to set the example every day. Not only did he take himself out on
[01:27:24] as many patrols as I would permit, he invariably pushed seated to the front of the column,
[01:27:28] eventually threatening to displace the point man. He exhibited such enthusiasm when he and I went
[01:27:36] on longer patrols that I had to order him back to the back of the column,
[01:27:40] less I find myself trailing him. He never meant disrespect. He just wanted to be upfront where the
[01:27:46] action might be. Pallaman was the perfect between sergeant.
[01:27:56] You're definitely blessed when you get it, when you get a leader like that in your command.
[01:28:04] And I was definitely lucky enough to serve with many guys with that kind of attitude that I had
[01:28:10] to hold back. Here's an interesting thing. He says during the war, we lost approximately 10,000 men
[01:28:21] to other than enemy fire. The anomalous so full of treachery danger and outright bad luck
[01:28:27] that he's on this administrative mission and he just like playing it safe. Because he isn't
[01:28:34] want to die, he's going to get killed by a criminal or getting a car accident, but you don't think
[01:28:40] about 10,000 people dying to be an ob just from other than combat.
[01:28:47] The heavy rain to discourage the enemy from moving against us.
[01:28:50] That was some comfort. Obviously they were human after all. Too often they seemed to
[01:28:57] above the constraints of normal men too hardened to the rigors that wore down the rest of us.
[01:29:03] Although it was tempting to rest on our haunches, taking advantage of the
[01:29:07] respite offered by the weather, I knew that in the long run it would be safer to push more on
[01:29:12] the offensive. To lie back would only allow the enemy to build their strength as I was building
[01:29:19] mine and allow them to choose the time and place of the next strike. I decided to go after them
[01:29:27] in their lair. One of the personnel changes I made was to take Killigan out of his squad leader
[01:29:34] physician. A sergeant arrived to take over the squad. I passed word to him to keep Killigan off
[01:29:40] point. Killigan did not like it and was close to the point of rebellion, but I refused to put him back
[01:29:46] on point. His luck was about to run out. No matter how good he might be, the odds are heavily
[01:29:52] stacked against the point man. My order, however, meant little. In variably, Killigan would move
[01:29:59] up to the front always out there a little advance of the moving element. It was a role he defined
[01:30:06] for himself. So obviously we're going to continue one of the themes of this book is be aggressive
[01:30:14] and stay on the offense. That's absolutely true. The reason I highlighted that thing with Killigan
[01:30:20] is because here you got a guy that's all about good order and discipline. But guess what? He's
[01:30:24] telling Killigan don't walk point, don't walk point, don't walk point. Killigan goes, okay,
[01:30:29] yeah, I won't walk point. Goes out on patrol goes up to point. That's also one of those things where
[01:30:34] you know, sometimes I get asked, you know, my boss is not doing this or we're not getting,
[01:30:38] we're getting a, we're not getting clear direction or I don't agree with this thing. Sometimes
[01:30:42] you got to make some stuff happen. You know, especially if it's the right thing to do,
[01:30:47] you got to make some stuff happen sometimes. Now they do some some operations and
[01:30:56] they're starting to take some toll on the enemy and here's what the enemy does. The enemy
[01:31:02] retaliated with more booby traps and other regular attacks. One morning the village chief was caught
[01:31:10] at the well as he bathed his ever present 45 caliber pistol left a few feet away with his pile of
[01:31:17] clothes. A small nine year old boy, no doubt acting on orders from a relative walked up,
[01:31:24] smiled and shot the chief twice with a 22 caliber pistol. Once again, however, the chief survived
[01:31:32] returning a few weeks later to resume his post. Specialist Barnes back from six days in Australia
[01:31:38] stepped on a booby trap and lost his right leg at the hip. Rob's in the nervous baby face
[01:31:43] kid from Illinois who had arrived at Palman got wedged head first in a Vietcong tunnel as he was
[01:31:49] clearing it. He panicked, vomited and drowned in his own puke before he could be pulled back out.
[01:31:57] Another man recently arrived sat down beside a trail to take a break and trip the Chinese
[01:32:02] claymore with his butt. I hope his mother would not ask to open his coffin. The gruesome
[01:32:10] toll of the booby traps wore on our nerves. No matter how many we found we knew there were others
[01:32:16] out there waiting for a missed step. The terror built is one thing to rush an enemy in battle and
[01:32:22] take your chances in the face of his firepower. The experience is frightening but the momentum of the
[01:32:27] act compels you forward, sparing you the agony of considering your predicament. Thinking your way
[01:32:33] through a booby trap there is completely different experience and much more harrowing.
[01:32:40] Moving along you suddenly notice a freshly smooth spot of dirt to your front. You look hard and see
[01:32:46] the three deadly prongs of the anti-personnel mind come into focus and unholy trinity extending
[01:32:52] from beneath the surface of the earth to greet your footfall and rip you apart. You look to your
[01:32:58] right and see a pile of rocks or intertwined twigs the vehicle on warning to their own that this is a
[01:33:04] killing ground. You order everyone to freeze as you strain your eyes to pick out more booby trap
[01:33:09] clues, your nerves have turned to steel coils. Your eyes dart over the ground for tethail signs
[01:33:16] of human tampering smooth dirt and unnaturally placed vine attached to a pole pin safety. A thin
[01:33:23] wire across your path, a broken brush, time stand still. You're afraid to move at the same time you
[01:33:30] want to duck your head and dash to safety. Maybe you can make it before the detonation catches you.
[01:33:36] But one of the others you have to get them all out. Keep cool. That's it. Bring the others slowly
[01:33:44] into a straight file. Careful. Watch where you step. Now work your way up to the front.
[01:33:50] Look carefully before each footfall. Watch for nearly invisible wires. One slight tug could
[01:33:56] bring metal tearing through your flesh like a frenzyed power saw. Okay, let's move. Stay in line.
[01:34:04] Don't bend chup. Can't let one booby trap get more than one of us but which one? Me, him, concentrate.
[01:34:11] Don't think about the explosion. Look, look, you can see them if you look carefully enough. Take
[01:34:18] another step. We're almost out of it. Christ don't ambush us. Now we can't move. Concerns and
[01:34:24] trait. Think of where you would plant them. Look for the telltale signs. And so it went.
[01:34:32] Tremendous pressure followed by Tremendous relief as the booby trap area was cleared.
[01:34:38] Then the journey continued only to bring the patrol to another threatening area.
[01:34:45] It played on your nerves. Somehow the men put on a show of bravado.
[01:34:53] I thought that section. Talking about getting ID. I mean that's like what it's like. It was just a
[01:35:00] perfect, perfect writing and being on out of patrols where you think and there's going to be
[01:35:06] ID's. That's what your mind is thinking. That's what you're thinking. You're looking at every little
[01:35:10] thing in the road, every little piece of trash, every little wire, everything could be a pressure
[01:35:14] plate. It could be a crush wire. It could be an ID. Could just be anything. And so you're just
[01:35:19] constantly in that mode of assessing and looking and trying to figure it out. And I thought that
[01:35:25] that was an incredible job, especially by a guy that actually triggered an ID on himself and got blown
[01:35:31] up. And so he's probably feeling that that pressure 10 fold. A leader who arbitrates when the
[01:35:39] laws of land warfare are overtaken by pragmatic concern is trading on dangerous ground.
[01:35:46] The laws exist for practical and humane reasons and I knew that well. But the consequences of
[01:35:53] my decisions were immediate and I could not afford the comfort of a philosophical debate on issues.
[01:35:58] I tried to behave in a humane manner and did not intimidate. But I persist until I was reasonably
[01:36:05] assured that I had the truth or that my interviewie truly did not know. I owed my men that much.
[01:36:15] One day a stay behind ambush element got into a sudden firefight in the exchange. One American
[01:36:21] had been hit in the leg and was bleeding profusely. As I approached the action with the rest of the
[01:36:26] troll and tending to flank the enemy, I noticed that the base of the hill we are about to send was
[01:36:32] heavily mined. A frightened farmer crouching the grass nearby. Come here, Papa Sonna called
[01:36:38] non, ask him how to get through this stuff. The farmer shook his head and dismay. A call came
[01:36:43] on the radio. Damn it if we don't get archable about it, here fast, he's going to bleed to death.
[01:36:48] Asm again, damn, I ordered again the farmer refused. His eyes widening in fear. I took out my knife.
[01:36:59] Man, tell him I'll kill him right now if he doesn't tell us. I had crossed the line.
[01:37:06] I wouldn't have killed him but he didn't know that. And the threat itself was criminal.
[01:37:12] But I weighed that against the bleeding soldier and the others who might bleed if we didn't get
[01:37:17] through to them quickly. A leader has no one to look to for advice on such decisions. He must
[01:37:24] do what he thinks is best but he must not fool himself as to the consequences of his choice.
[01:37:31] War is not a series of case studies that can be scrutinized with the objectivity.
[01:37:36] It is a series of stark confrontations that must be faced under the most emotion-wrenching conditions.
[01:37:42] War is the suffering and death of people you know set against a background of the suffering and death
[01:37:50] of people you do not. That reality tends to prejudice the already tough choices between morality and
[01:37:59] pragmatism. The farmer let us through. We force the enemy away and extract it our soldier in time
[01:38:07] to save his life. We let the farmer go but not before I thank him. He looked at me as if I were crazy.
[01:38:21] Very enough to just say again this is another great description of what you're dealing with in
[01:38:28] war and the decisions that you have to make in these horrible situations. Back to the book, Fricker was nervous.
[01:38:38] For the past few days he felt his number was coming up. I don't know what's wrong with me lieutenant.
[01:38:44] He had told me shyly I don't feel right. What do you mean? Are you feeling sick? I asked,
[01:38:50] no it's not that I just feel down like something bad is going to happen.
[01:38:56] Maybe you've been on point too often. I'll tell Staff Sergeant Robinson to take you off. No,
[01:39:03] no don't do that. I'm the best man for that my squad. I don't want any of the guys thinking I'm yellow.
[01:39:12] Fricker wasn't yellow. He was scared but he was more scared of letting his friends down than
[01:39:18] of getting hurt. I urged him to take a break but he had insisted on staying on point. I told Robinson
[01:39:27] to take him off anyway. Fricker heard of it and pleaded with me to put him back. I yielded.
[01:39:34] So on a lovely evening Fricker was cautiously leading the squad up a hill and the machine gun
[01:39:40] stitched him across the chest. Robinson turned and dashed down the slope making it 20 meters before
[01:39:47] he stumbled and broke his ankle. Ten meters behind Fricket, nail and a Wilson do for cover.
[01:39:55] Fricker went down on one knee and spun around to face his friends.
[01:40:02] Blood and air bubbled from the holes in his chest. He dropped his weapon and tried to
[01:40:08] rise his arms out stretched as if reaching for help. His eyes open wide and tear his mouth
[01:40:15] a gap as blood spilled over his loose lower lip. As the machine gun bullets tore into his back,
[01:40:22] he tumbled face down arm still reaching out for help. That would come too late.
[01:40:30] Wilson took in the scene with horror. Fricker's dead, my god, Fricker's dead. His voice rose above
[01:40:36] the clatter. A freight that no one understood Wilson repeated his announcement to him. No, he's dead.
[01:40:41] He's dead. He yelled with all his might. Nail silence them with a Kurt shut up. He's dead.
[01:40:49] And that's all there is to it. Somehow nails words cut through the hideousness of the moment
[01:40:55] more graphically than Fricker's death. Wilson was stunned into silence. There was a cursory exchange
[01:41:02] of rounds. The enemy fled down the reverse slope and Fricker's corpse became the
[01:41:06] war and the lame robins were evacuated. Nail became the squad leader. That was all there was
[01:41:16] to it. Another American had fallen. One of more than 58,000 to die in Vietnam.
[01:41:29] The action took a few minutes. There was nothing unique about it. A messy business to be sure.
[01:41:34] But one that could be cleaned up by shipping off the body and making a few personnel changes.
[01:41:40] But Fricker was dead. A few moments earlier. He had been a young man with a lifetime of
[01:41:47] experience as a head of him. Now he was just a memory to his family and to us. A few moments earlier
[01:41:54] he was afraid some of his friends would think of him as a coward. Soon, almost no one would think
[01:42:02] of him at all. His mother would get a telegram and then a purple heart. Maybe I could write him up
[01:42:11] for a medal. But what should I say? That he was brave because he was afraid to be afraid.
[01:42:22] That he saved a squad by walking up to the machine gun first and what did he save them for?
[01:42:29] So that they might live a few more weeks before following in his footsteps.
[01:42:37] It was all too much to consider. His nail had said he was dead.
[01:42:45] And that's all that was to it. Here he talks a little bit about the morality of war. It was not
[01:42:55] a simple matter of killer be killed. I had to think of my men. I could not let them be killed
[01:43:02] because of a rigid morality on my part. But if I compromised with that morality too often,
[01:43:10] I would become little more than a war criminal unfit to lead those men's. I had to struggle to
[01:43:18] keep a sense of balance. That's the crazy thing about the dichotomy of leadership. Is that these
[01:43:27] opposing forces that are pulling you in two different directions? They're both correct. It's
[01:43:33] correct. They're both correct and the balance is where you need to stay. I shouldn't say that
[01:43:37] they're both correct, but they're both viable options. You can rationalize either one of them.
[01:43:44] You can rationalize, hey, we shouldn't do anything at all. Let's just stay inside the
[01:43:46] wire. Let me protect my guys. You can rationalize that. You can rationalize, hey, let's go out
[01:43:51] and kill everybody before they kill us. And what you have to do is a leader in a combat situation.
[01:43:56] You have to balance those dichotomies. And you know, you could translate that into businesses.
[01:44:01] Because in a business, you've got to take care of your people, but you've got to make money.
[01:44:07] So there's all these, when you're in a leadership position, there's opposing forces that are
[01:44:11] pulling it you and you have to balance them. And you have to pay attention because what happens is
[01:44:16] suddenly you start going too far in one direction or the other and you start to re- start to lose control.
[01:44:21] Where you start to see things go sideways. That's when you do say yourself, wait a second.
[01:44:24] Am I going too far in one direction right now? That's probably what is happening.
[01:44:31] Now, here we go. This is just a quick little interlude they had. They had acquired a
[01:44:38] 60 millimeter mortar. And they were training with it. And one of the guys was wanting to train
[01:44:44] it. They didn't really let them use it too much even though he was excited to try it out.
[01:44:48] And they end up getting attacked and the only guy that's in for the vicinity of the mortar to use it
[01:44:53] is this guy, Spangler. And so he attempts to fire the mortar and he screws it up
[01:44:59] a bunch of times and the VC end up getting away.
[01:45:05] And McDonald says, dejectively, I scout, I scout at Spangler.
[01:45:10] Who felt absolutely terrible about the whole of the fair? I knew it wasn't his fault. It was mine.
[01:45:18] I had failed to train him even though he was eager to learn more ownership right there from
[01:45:24] McDonald. Now, this is just a shocker in the book and it's one of those situations
[01:45:36] which is going to really this, how does this even happen? McDonald decides that they're actually
[01:45:43] by the ocean. There are a couple miles from the ocean. And they all have their skin. They have
[01:45:50] jungle rot, their skin. They get little infections. They got bug bites and they're just all jacked up
[01:45:54] from this, from just living in this environment. And he knows, he says, you know, if we get these
[01:46:00] guys to patrol down to the ocean, they can take us from the ocean and get out in the sun,
[01:46:03] dry some of their wounds off or what have you. So they go down there, he puts together the plan.
[01:46:10] He actually has to ask the guys to go. Because they're saying, you know what,
[01:46:16] I'd rather sit here and just have bad skin than go out and have to do another patrol just to go
[01:46:24] swimming. And he kind of convinces a couple guys, hey, there's a couple guys that want to go. There's
[01:46:28] a couple guys that say, you know, I'd rather not go. He convinces the guys to go. He puts together a
[01:46:35] plan. He wants to send some strong squimmers with the group. He's actually pretty aware of the
[01:46:39] danger of the ocean. He sends the guys down there. They get down there. And two of the guys
[01:46:47] drown and die. And again, we're going to hear some ownership here. James was the guy that was
[01:46:57] running the patrol. And McDonald says, I could not criticize James. He had not followed my instructions,
[01:47:05] but the fault was mine, not his. I had built the idea into a plan and then ordered its execution.
[01:47:12] And in so doing, I had executed Spangler and Evans. I felt a hundred years old. No tragedy in that
[01:47:22] God forsaken country had hit me so hard. It was my fault. I was the cause of two deaths in the
[01:47:29] name of good intentions. I had talked those men into dying. I staggered under the thought, the cost
[01:47:37] of leadership and finally been too high. And I couldn't bear it. I didn't consider myself fit to
[01:47:43] lead. But the job was mine. And I couldn't quit for better or worse. I had to do it.
[01:47:55] They get back to camp and Wilson, who is good friends with Evans. One of the guys that had
[01:48:02] drowned, he says Wilson was crying. The loss of Evans's close friend had deeply affected him.
[01:48:10] Asshamed of his tears, he hunkered down behind his machine gun at the strong point on the south side
[01:48:15] of the perimeter. I spoke of Evans' goodness and tried to draw from that a benevolent interpretation
[01:48:25] of his death. Evans was a piece now I told Wilson. He was no longer part of this nightmarish war.
[01:48:32] Although I couldn't follow the logic of my own words, they seemed to lighten Wilson's load.
[01:48:39] He began to talk. Together we groped for meaning and a man's death.
[01:48:45] I did my best to conceal my own skepticism and agreed with everything he said.
[01:48:50] Somehow we came to the conclusion that Evans' death was a good thing. It must be good if God
[01:48:58] willed it. By then I wasn't sure who is consoling whom. Sometimes words aren't important for
[01:49:05] their content, but only for there being said. And whatever we said that night seemed to be good enough
[01:49:11] for both of us. Although I couldn't excuse myself for the drownings, I realized that I owed it
[01:49:17] not only to Wilson, but the whole of the town to put the incident behind me.
[01:49:25] Now the next situation that they're in, they're doing an assault.
[01:49:31] And as they get through these, they're assaulting all mine through a target area.
[01:49:34] And as they assault all mine through this target area, there's a vehicle
[01:49:41] and his weapon had been smashed by around and he wasn't able to fight and so he just surrendered.
[01:49:45] And this guy, NAN, who I mentioned this guy, NAN before this NAN is a Vietnamese guy. That's a
[01:49:50] word. That's a translator interpreted. They call him Kit Carson Scouts. They know that they know
[01:49:54] the area. They speak the language. And so he says, ask him if he's got any buddies on flank security.
[01:50:01] I instructed NAN. A rush of Vietnamese words and sued only to be answered by no-beck
[01:50:08] and American Vietnamese slang version of, I don't understand.
[01:50:12] God damn it. He's speaking Vietnamese to you, answer him. I shouted in the prisoner's face.
[01:50:18] NAN asked him again, the man's face, the man turned his face away defiantly.
[01:50:24] My anger was rising after my worries of the night before about finding a way to the target
[01:50:29] and the successful attack that followed everything could be overturned by an arrogant,
[01:50:34] by the arrogance of one prisoner. Killigan, seeing the way my face was flushed, made the quiet
[01:50:43] comment. Don't be mad, Lieutenant. He's just a soldier. Same as you and me. Damn him. He was right.
[01:50:54] I would hope to do the same if I were in the shoes of a captive of the captive. Killigan,
[01:51:00] the quiet man who dissed out all pretence of leadership once again made me aware of the fragile
[01:51:06] superiority of my own leadership. And then as they proceed on, they take these captured guys
[01:51:20] and they bring them back to the company command post and we'll go back to the book.
[01:51:25] At the end of the morning's fight, we linked up with the rest of the company,
[01:51:28] essentially a reinforced platoon that had comprised the blocking force. I turned over our prisoners
[01:51:34] to the platoon leader, a young journalist first action, who I later found out did not last another
[01:51:40] two weeks. Predictedably, the company commander had stayed back at the base.
[01:51:47] Bring the go, bring the gooks over to the CP,
[01:51:50] Lieutenant pastor to my sergeant. They aren't gooks, I said quietly. They're soldiers just like you and me.
[01:52:02] For a moment, I thought I saw Killigan's eyes flash. Then we started our journey home.
[01:52:09] They're going to go on up company sized operation, which means they're taking multiple
[01:52:13] platoons of which McDonald's is one of the platoon commanders. And the company commander
[01:52:18] was named Moray and Moray calls them all together to do brief and Moray. I haven't talked about
[01:52:26] this much, but Moray is kind of a guy that's, he's not real proactive in getting out in the field.
[01:52:31] So he's sort of staying back on base, he's a little nervous about the situation.
[01:52:38] And this is just a great example. And then he's got the other platoon commanders who you
[01:52:42] kind of hear his judgment on them. But this is a great display of leadership of taking
[01:52:49] ownership up and down the chain of command and two his peers. So, here we go from the book.
[01:52:58] The plan would put Moray, who's the company commander, 2,000 meters away from our present location
[01:53:02] and 4,000 meters away from the objective. I tried to conceal my disdain.
[01:53:08] Sir, request permission to control the operational movement of the new resources in the initial phase
[01:53:14] of the operation. I spoke with one. I hope with a totally expressionless face. So he's saying
[01:53:20] listen, boss, you're going to be way over there. Why don't I just go ahead and control this?
[01:53:26] The boss says, sure, Jim, I guess that makes sense. You're the senior lieutenant among the platoons.
[01:53:31] Did you have a plan in mind? Moray was easy and I was going to take advantage of it. Boom.
[01:53:38] I briefed him on my concept, my concept routes of movement where we would set up,
[01:53:43] time of anticipated contact with the enemy and types of weaponry, wooden carry.
[01:53:48] The captain concurred with the plans, then excused himself. I've got to get back to the CP and
[01:53:54] report to Battalion. Seeing an opportunity for complete freedom of action, I continued. Sir,
[01:54:01] I need to flesh out the details with the other platoon leaders. May I brief them in your absence?
[01:54:06] Yes, certainly. Carry on. He left as we stood up to salute. So, you see what just happened. How
[01:54:12] beautiful that was? He took total control. And not only did he take control up the chain of
[01:54:18] command, but he's going to get some control over the pierves as well. And he's judging and passing
[01:54:25] judgment on the way the other platoons are running there. The way the other platoon commanders
[01:54:30] are running their platoons. And he says, observing all this, I silently wrote Lieutenant Smalley
[01:54:37] out of the plan. If he could not exercise minimum control in the defense, he would surely fall
[01:54:43] apart in the attack. Lieutenant Evans, first platoon's leader was anxious. He had been on the job
[01:54:49] only a week and this was his first operation. He was a tall, good-looking boy from the Midwest,
[01:54:54] but I felt he was too eager. He was disappointed to be standing pat for the night as the reserve
[01:55:01] unit. But the call had been marae's not mine. Perhaps who's unfair of me to make snap
[01:55:07] judgments of others and then plan my actions on the bases of those judgments. The thought bothered
[01:55:13] me, but not enough to deter me. I was in the business of evaluating people and the traits of
[01:55:18] other men would determine my own fate and that of my soldiers. Presumptuous though my role may have
[01:55:24] been, I had to make judgments and act accordingly. Marae was timid, Smalley was weak, Evans was
[01:55:31] eager. I did not condemn them for that. I noted it and adjusted. We were in a war, not a community
[01:55:40] social. Just great leadership example of how you lead up and down the chain of command.
[01:55:50] So now, I'll actually about to head out on this on this operation. About 50 meters short of the
[01:55:56] forward of the stream, Killigan Dog Leg to the West and brought us up on the trail. The heavy
[01:56:02] labor and the bush brought beads and swept to my forehead and concentrated on our present movement,
[01:56:08] leaving thoughts of the night operation for later. We were soon in the treacherous position of
[01:56:12] doubling back on a previously-used route, always dangerous tactic. For a second, I considered yelling
[01:56:18] at Killigan to get off the trail, but we were so close to the Ford that by the time we maneuvered
[01:56:23] off the trail, we would have been at the crossing site. As Killigan moved ahead and his stealthy
[01:56:28] glide, I saw him freeze momentarily and then glanced to his left directly into a bush overlooking
[01:56:34] the trail. I knew in an instant that we were an eminent danger for Killigan never made a
[01:56:40] abrupt moves except at the movement of conflict, except at the moment of conflict. Killigan turned
[01:56:46] back to us, his face contorting as if to shout a warning. I yelled ambush and dove to my left.
[01:56:53] Killigan took a grenade blast in the face at point blank range. At the same time, sergeant james
[01:57:00] went down with his bullet in his shoulder. The enemy was spraying us from a position across the
[01:57:05] rice patty, Killigan and I had hit a Killigan, had hit a command detonated booby trap.
[01:57:13] I pressed my face into the dirt as bullets wind over my outstretched body. I calculated that
[01:57:18] the best at best, they were only four of us were left. I peaked out from under my helmet to see
[01:57:24] james struggling to get off the trail, the red blotch widening in his dark green fatigue. He was
[01:57:30] moving not into the bushes but toward Killigan, who is lying face down in the patty with a blast
[01:57:35] at knocked him, his blood turning the yellowish water red. Within minutes if he was still alive,
[01:57:42] Killigan would drown. So they get Killigan out of that situation, they get back to their base,
[01:57:54] they go back again to do the ambush, they're hit again on the ambush, they evacuated guy,
[01:58:02] they move again and now they're in the final moment where they are going to do this big
[01:58:14] ambush as part of the company. So this is kind of what this last section of the book is leading to.
[01:58:20] It is morning, and so there are actually the through in the final movement into the ambush position.
[01:58:27] It is morning and there is a grime agrimnus in the drizzling air. Silent figures move to the
[01:58:34] west, shoulders bent under equipment loads, buckles taped for silence, camouflage paint smeared on
[01:58:41] top faces. Gools in the night, young boys really, from places like Valdoista, San Diego,
[01:58:51] Bolther, Madison, Portland, out to kill Asian boys who are out to kill them. The gears of war
[01:59:01] grind together unrelentingly, mechanisms in motion that will catch up human flesh as they mesh.
[01:59:09] Society's clash, politicians deal, diplomats debate, young men struggle to the death.
[01:59:17] Tomorrow or the next day, mothers will receive the news and cry, but nothing will stop the
[01:59:25] morning's killings. They finally get to their ambush site and now the ambush is about to happen.
[01:59:38] Simultaneously, another group of enemy walks into the third ambush site. It is tripped in all the
[01:59:43] enemy are killed. The first group of three hears the melee and panics. One darts back.
[01:59:49] Nan, the old scout catches him with a round on the side. He falls in the old man finishes him
[01:59:57] with two rounds in the head. Two of the enemy scramble through Sergeant Don's position and are hit.
[02:00:04] One falls dead. The other scampers into the brush. Don pursues.
[02:00:10] The wounded enemy ducks into a hole in the ground. Obviously he is familiar with the territory.
[02:00:17] In Vietnamese, Don yells from to come out. There is no reply. Don yells again.
[02:00:24] Bullets spray out of the hole. Don lubs a grenade. Dirt leaves and flesh fly out of the opening
[02:00:31] in front of the blast. Don throws a second grenade. A death rattle rass from the hole.
[02:00:40] Sergeant Don looks around for the newest soldier. Spodding an 18 year old, he sends him in. A safe
[02:00:46] way to harden the youngster toward the events and store for him during the year to come.
[02:00:53] The youth emerges dragging the Viet Kong behind him. It's a gruesome site.
[02:00:58] The man's face knows mouth eyes are gone. Air is sucked into the hole where the nostrils
[02:01:10] used to connect. The jelly-like mass rising and falling in bubbles. Woundscape everywhere on his body.
[02:01:19] There is nothing we can do for him. It would be inhumane to prolong his agony.
[02:01:26] They accomplished that ambush and they are continuing to press the enemy.
[02:01:34] But something that McDonald didn't count on. Something that he couldn't have predicted
[02:01:42] or that he failed to predict. Back to the book, but I underestimated the ruthlessness of our enemy.
[02:01:50] I failed to realize the extent to which political ideology can displace human morality.
[02:01:58] It was a major oversight and it cost us the village of Trong Lamb. Trong Lamb is the village
[02:02:06] that they were actually their permanent was next to this whole time. I should have gone over
[02:02:10] that right in the beginning. But Trong Lamb is the village that they were there to protect. They were
[02:02:15] there to protect these villagers and keep them safe and keep the veot Kong and the communist out of the
[02:02:21] area. They are sitting in their perimeter one night. They are literally just meters from the village.
[02:02:33] That's where this whole story is taking place. As they are sitting there, we will go to the book.
[02:02:39] The first explosion ripped one of the hot support in a blaze of brilliant orange and yellow flame.
[02:02:44] Another deafening explosion than another rip through the air, punctuated by the staccato
[02:02:49] clatter of automatic weapons. We braced trying to print pinpoint the direction of the attack.
[02:02:57] My god, I explained, I exclaimed to no one in particular. They're hitting the village.
[02:03:06] It would be a butchery. The veot Kong had penetrated the eastern end of the village
[02:03:13] and were moving from that hut to thatch hut, throwing satchel charges inside and shooting down anything
[02:03:19] that moved. Sergeant Palamine. Leave back third squad and come with me. We're counter attacking
[02:03:27] into the village in two minutes. They dashed for the village. We dashed for the village as the
[02:03:34] flames burst upward. The scene revealed before us was ghastly. A mother ran by me with her decapitated
[02:03:41] baby, her own left arm hanging by a strip of flesh. Two veot Kong stood behind her trying to shoot
[02:03:47] them down, and cold rage, I fired into their faces. Their heads collapsing into a pulpy mush.
[02:03:56] Two young girls came running at me tears of pain streaming from their eyes at a glance I could
[02:04:01] see that both had been disfigured by shrapnel. The veot Kong had their mission. Kill as many
[02:04:07] villagers as quickly as possible and they were doing it well, but they didn't expect our
[02:04:12] sudden rush upon the midpoint blank range. From somewhere in the smoke and fire a woman emerged
[02:04:19] with her young son. She thrust a little boy at me begging for help and veot and amise. The boy
[02:04:25] was folded completely in half at the stomach a deep wound across the small of his back allowing
[02:04:30] his fat little body to be creased as neatly as a piece of cardboard. Surely he was dead. I looked
[02:04:38] into the mother's eyes and patented her on the head. Later, I said, I'll help you later. We pressed
[02:04:44] the attack back to the edge of the village almost a fourth of it was now burning. One more
[02:04:49] American fell with a chest wound and collapsed as long. We broke the back of the attack. Vc
[02:04:56] bodies laid sprawled on the wire through which they could not withdraw. The dead and dying
[02:05:03] lay everywhere a bit amid the burning huts. From the glare of the roaring flames I could see dead
[02:05:10] and wounded Vietnamese laying in twisted piles. Already the older women had begun their pitiful
[02:05:16] whales of mourning, shrieking and tearing at their hair and faces. Smoke filled the air,
[02:05:23] but it could not cover the accurate smell of death that filled my nostrils. Children search for
[02:05:29] their missing elders or huddled in groups, groping at each other for comfort. Their eyes wide and terror.
[02:05:37] A mother rocked her one-legged baby to her breast, his lifeless eyes undisturbed by the bright
[02:05:42] flame, silireting them both. The worst had happened. The enemy had struck directly against the village
[02:05:52] and had most assuredly killed and wounded many of their own families. It was unbelievable,
[02:05:59] but it had been done. I knew that true-long lamb had been a defeat.
[02:06:07] Like the entire American system in Vietnam we had fought a limited military war with constrained
[02:06:12] objectives. The enemy had fought a total political war with no pre-ordained restrictions.
[02:06:19] We were doomed from the outset. We were the focus of the vehicle on attacks because we kept
[02:06:30] the village alive. If we died so with the village, but even at that we were the indirect objective.
[02:06:39] The village was the direct objective. If the villages were destroyed, then there would be no village.
[02:06:45] But only now did I understand that kind of logic. It had not occurred to me that the enemy
[02:06:52] could take such a step to hit the village would ensure the wounding and killing of their own kin.
[02:07:00] In a battle within the confines of the village itself there could be no discrimination among
[02:07:05] family, communist sympathizers and government loyalists.
[02:07:08] Every day I saw the children of the village, they were like all children, queue and deering,
[02:07:16] growing with the emotional and physical needs of children the world over.
[02:07:22] I couldn't hurt them. It was unthinkable. The possibility was so barbaric that it was alien to my mind.
[02:07:31] But my mind was not the mind of the enemy.
[02:07:33] Though I had tried to understand them even to think like them, if only to defeat them,
[02:07:41] I had fallen short. For a few more days, we continued to patrol the area.
[02:07:50] It was a bureaucratic gesture, a mere continuance of what we had been doing for so long.
[02:07:56] I kept to myself my own recognition of the emptiness of our work. It was essential for the
[02:08:04] men to be convinced of the importance of their mission.
[02:08:09] Chuang Lam was no more, but leadership must always be positive.
[02:08:17] So he wasn't really expecting that that the VC would come in and just slaughter everyone in
[02:08:30] the village or as many people as they could. Unbelievable savagery.
[02:08:37] Now as we wrap this up, he gets his relief. Just like he had come in the beginning of the book
[02:08:50] and he takes over for somebody. Somebody comes to take his place and he leaves.
[02:08:54] And he tries to keep track of what happened to them or how they fought and things that occurred.
[02:09:07] And we'll go to the book here as scheduled, the platoon moved on and continued to fight.
[02:09:11] As long as I could, I kept the watch on the fate of the men. Specialist Nail was wounded yet again.
[02:09:18] Platoon Sergeant Palaman got out in front of the platoon and a firefight and took an enemy
[02:09:23] rocket-propelled grenade in the right leg. I learned that Corporal Killigan survived his wounds,
[02:09:30] although he lost a long and a stretch of intestines. Sergeant Don made it home on touch to
[02:09:36] one of the few. Sergeant James and Specialist King were killed, although the circumstances surrounding
[02:09:43] their deaths were never made clear to me. And so it went. An infantry men's days were numbered and the
[02:09:53] law of attrition applied to the platoon as it always did. In the summer of 1971, I flew out of
[02:10:05] Camerand Bay to return to my wife and infant son. I had just made captain. It had been a long 12 months
[02:10:15] and I had changed in more ways than rank. A National Airport in Washington, D.C., a pretty young woman
[02:10:26] stood waiting in the terminal as I walked up the ramp. By her knee stood a 15-month-old child with
[02:10:34] curly blonde hair barely able to keep his balance on his chubby little legs. I kissed them both
[02:10:41] hello. The woman was happy. The boy was confused. I was both. I was also sad. I mourned for the men
[02:10:58] I had left behind. I grieved that their country would never know what fine men they were.
[02:11:09] I was proud to have served with them. And no doubt, I absolutely feel the same way.
[02:11:20] The amazing men and women who I saw cut down at the height of their lives.
[02:11:34] Our country will never really know what fine people they were, what fine human beings they were.
[02:11:52] I hope that from that, from their sacrifice we can take and we can learn from what they
[02:11:59] learned. And we can be inspired by them and driven by them and become better leaders and better
[02:12:07] people from their example. And from the example of men like Jim McDonough and Hackworth and Bob Hoffman
[02:12:18] can't all those other those warriors and leaders that have taken point and led the way.
[02:12:34] And we try to follow them down that path. As we remember those who gave their lives
[02:12:54] to clear that path for us, just so much to be taken away from this experience.
[02:13:10] And it's almost like let's just read the whole book.
[02:13:15] But there's so much more that I didn't cover that I wanted to. And you know the fact of the
[02:13:24] matter is you can get this book on Amazon. You buy the book, you learn. That's what you do.
[02:13:31] You don't have to live through this stuff to be able to take away some of the lessons from it.
[02:13:37] And because that was such a such a good book and there's so much information in it. Obviously
[02:13:44] I went long. So we're gonna hold off until next time to do a little Q&A.
[02:13:55] But if you do want to support the podcast, there's a couple of ways you can do that.
[02:14:04] Number one, you can go to the website. Jocquistore.com. You can click on the Amazon link and you can
[02:14:16] buy this book right here. The book is called the two-meter a memoir of command and combat by James
[02:14:22] Armick Duna. And you should do that. You should do yourself that favor.
[02:14:28] Yeah, and also another way it could be simpler is just go to the website, jocquist.com and go
[02:14:36] into the books section or list all the books that you cover. That'll be on there. You just click on the
[02:14:40] book, boom it'll take you right to the to the Amazon link even easier. Yeah that way you don't have
[02:14:46] to search if you're, you know, if you're in a time crunch. I like that. What else, what else can we do
[02:14:52] to support the podcast? Just if you're going to buy anything from Amazon go to the jocquistore.com
[02:14:58] or jocquist.com click on the Amazon link before you do your shopping. It'll take you to Amazon just
[02:15:03] like you would have gone anyway. And then you know, do your shopping. There you go you can support that
[02:15:09] way passively. And then also on jocquistore if you like, you know, the shirts we got,
[02:15:17] some coffee mugs on there, some stickers or whatever. You know, if you like any of that stuff,
[02:15:21] just get some, get some. And of course, if you're into supplements or you're running low on
[02:15:30] supplements, go to or go back to on it.com slash jocco and and get some those are the good ones.
[02:15:40] Pick up some acrylic oil for yourself. Yeah. Pick up some strong bone. Pick up where your bars.
[02:15:47] Some warrior bars. Somebody got a little low. I've got a little shipment of warrior bars in today. And I
[02:15:51] must say thank you. Yeah. It's just a game. It's just it saves the day. Yeah. It saves the day. Let's
[02:15:58] snack snacks. Someone asked, uh, are warrior bars postwork out or are they a meal replacement? Like what
[02:16:06] are they all the above? It's all of that. And it's just a snack. It's a snack. But then you eat
[02:16:13] two that's a little meal. You eat three that's like a full meal more or less. Maybe with a salad or something.
[02:16:20] But it's yeah, it's it's good. As always, if you want to kind of kick it with echo and I,
[02:16:31] you can do that right on the olden webs. And I am at jocco-willing echo Charles is at echo Charles.
[02:16:40] That's on the Twitter. That's on the Facebook. Uh, that's also on the Instagram. Oh,
[02:16:47] quick thing about the Instagram. I just found this out not yesterday, but like the day before
[02:16:52] that there's like direct messages on Instagram. You probably didn't even know that. Yeah. I
[02:16:59] I did not know that because they have it on Twitter and people send me direct messages. Okay. So
[02:17:03] you can show me how to check that. Well, yeah. Okay. So you're using people send me some messages.
[02:17:08] Yeah. A lot of people send me some and it's been I've had Instagram for a long time. Yeah. So there's a lot
[02:17:14] of them. I'm like, oh, man, I got a respond, but basically if if I don't respond, it's not because I'm
[02:17:20] ignoring it. It's because straight up I didn't know it was going off. You're supposed to be the
[02:17:26] the tech guy here. Oh, man. I know. Hey, I'm learning. Hey, look, I learned, right? Yes, you did. Good.
[02:17:32] Did learn with that. You can join us there and you can join us as we continue to try and get a
[02:17:42] little bit better. Trying to do a little bit better. And we got examples of leadership like McDonald
[02:17:50] uh, like the people that we talk about. The people that I admire and the people that I look to and
[02:17:57] say, yes, that person stepped up and led. That's the example that I try and follow. People that
[02:18:08] stepped up and led through hard situations who dealt with the dichotomy of leadership and yet
[02:18:15] dealt with the almost unwinnable situations dealt with the rules of engagement dealt with
[02:18:21] challenges dealt with their own platoonly members threatening them to kill them dealt with all
[02:18:29] of those things and yet they still led. And so us we got it easy. We got it easy. So there's no excuse
[02:18:45] none to stop any of us from getting up and getting after it. So until next time
[02:18:59] this is Echo and Jockel out.
