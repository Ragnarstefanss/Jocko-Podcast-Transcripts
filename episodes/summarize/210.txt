Good evening and the last time that Dave was on we discussed Marine Corps doctrinal publication three-taque one tactics which starts with a line that reads this publication is about winning in combat which isn't an outstanding way to start off any publication of any kind and we actually ended up covering that manual on a series of four-prongcast 187-188-189 and 190 and that definitely is an outstanding manual when it comes to winning in combat for sure it explains the concepts it reveals the underlying philosophies and there are other doctrinal publications from the Marine Corps on operations and on strategy and on campaigning and there's manuals on intelligence and expeditionary operations and logistics and planning and command and control there's a manual on the Marine rifle squad they got manuals for everything there's even a Marine Corps warfighting publication of three-taque 15.1 called machine guns and machine gun gunnery which is a four-hundred and six-page manual by the way four-hundred and six-page manual this is the manual where you learn that quote this machine gun supports both the offense and defense it provides the heavy volume of close accurate and continuous fire support necessary to suppress and destroy enemy fortifications, vehicles and personnel in support of an attack the long range close defensive and final protective fires delivered by this gun forming integral part of the units defensive fires so they're going deep on machine guns and machine gun gunnery is there a title of any book in the world that has gun in it more times I don't know of any it also shows you exactly how to fire from the bipod with a 240 Gulf so firing from the bipod when firing from the bipod the rear sight is raised a assume a prone position behind the gun with the right shoulder into the weapon the right hand grasps the pistol grip and manipulates the trigger place the left hand on the comb of the stock palm down with the cheek resting lightly against the cover and or the left hand both hands exert a firm steady pressure to the rear during aiming and firing on like the tripod the bipod mount is relatively unstable elbows and upper torso may move a good sight picture must be regained before firing each burst so we're getting detailed there's no there's not much room for interpretation we're getting the instruction that we need by the way the army also has a manual for machine gunners the FM3 attack 22.68 crew served machine gun which doesn't actually cover the 50 cow it's got another manual for that doesn't cover the mod do's you know essentially the point is he forced it he tried to force it so it didn't work so in real life how that looks is like every get like I don't know your friends like a real estate agent or something any sending you like handwritten notes like hey just wondering how you're doing it like probably I don't even know you that you know it's like you'd throw obvious the one they try to force a good relationship you know I mean it's going to be freezing, there's waves it makes everything I want to give an accurate assessment I would say that if you compare to like hey we're going to take a helicopter to this target and we're going to land it we're going to patrol in compared to we're going to take boats over the beach and swim in I think it's probably I would say six times harder six times harder maybe four, maybe four to six times harder it's that much harder, I'm thinking about the preparation that you have to do and the worries that you have and then where you have a problem like you're let's face it once you're on the ground you're not going to have a problem like we got this, you're bringing the boats in at night you're sending swimmer scouts in to go there and signal that the beach I mean you're losing people bro it's crazy and then you're swimming in there's waves your boats can get turned over, your motors can fail it's just total, it makes everything so much harder so I had this Vietnam era guy that was saying to do something a certain way and we at the beginning of our training when we start to work with companies and we're going to do for years the very first thing we start with after setting the table of all these concepts is leadership capital and the question yourself every single time is what I'm going to do a deposit or is it a withdrawal and when people think of those terms they this book is called leadership strategy and tactics are you thinking strategically in this even in this conversation we're having and you know the idea of what is the likelihood this is going to advance my relationship the answer is 99.9% of the time going to be super obvious is going to stare you in the face and if you think strategically you will almost never make a leadership withdrawal you'll almost never have any capital you're taking out of the bank and then when you you said don't don't create drama over your ego and when you're ego gets in the way almost every single time even when you get what you want you are taking a you're taking money out of the bank you're depleting your leadership capital until eventually you have none and nobody wants you to win it's amazing that it's so obvious like this is so obvious that is it now the conversation is open and you can begin to figure out why the boss's idea is what it is and what you can do to influence that idea but before even getting to that point ask yourself some simple questions first how much will be gained by approaching the boss and trying to convince them to change their plan if the difference is minimal it's probably not worth investing any time or effort into it next ask yourself how much of your concern is just your ego there is a chance that you see it your way of doing things there is a chance that you see your way of doing something as smarter or more efficient then what the boss has offered if that is the case and you don't truly think there is much to be gained by using your method let it go don't create drama over your ego lastly ask yourself if you will be moving your relationship with your boss forward or backward by raising this issue I mean hammering that like at the master at the master I didn't say hey every conversation I'm going to have with another person is to improve the relationship that's like priority number one priority number one I'm going to improve our relationship if I'm going to have a conversation with Dave or relationship is getting better what Dave's walking around walking away from the conversation going man but you do the point remains yes yes hundred check check I mean this is you know and same with like at national on front we're doing all kinds of things at national on front all kinds of things I actually talked about this in the master nostril is really the most I've talked really I mean not a ton but several times I use in his example that at you know the actual echelon front muster there's a lot of moving parts there's a lot of things happening there's there's very audio visual stuff happening there's kids being made to hand out to people there's PT going on there's so much there's there's registration happening there's check in there's hand out of stuff there's organizing of tape there's all this there's just just huge logistical things that are happening how much do I know of what's going on next to none next to none and Jamie who runs the master like she knows she knows what the intent is and if she feels like there's a little I'm not 100% on this one I'm not sure she'll be and I call you that looks good right down to win my boss would say hey, jocco here's what I want you to do okay boss let me interpret that does this make sense is this what you really want is this this is this can I turn this on this direction and move a little bit more in the opposite way so I can achieve this result instead all that is based on relationships so developing these relationships is is the most important thing 99.9% of what you do should be from the relationships you have going back to the book there is another key element to leading any exceptional team relationships leaders leadership requires relationships good relationships with people above you below you and beside you in the chain of command are critical for a strong team the better the relationships the more open and effective communication there is the more communication there's the stronger the team will be for example there are times when a boss is driving forward on a less than ideal path that needs to be redirected if you have a good relationship with the boss you can explain tactfully what you see to be errors in their thoughts and ideas as always the approach you used to discuss this is important put the onus on yourself as to why the idea doesn't make sense for example you know boss this is who I am the biggest takeaway from that because most of the people listening just like me aren't seals and art the thing that you said that I think is the most important of all that is the thing about frame of mind because what happens in the circumstances and all you can't control any of those things but everybody is going to be exposed to some things in their life and if you have the right frame of mind you can actually learn from it you were talking about being in high school it isn't just that you had different groups of friends if you're like me which I think you were even in high school you were looking and saying I can see the glide path for that group it's not guaranteed but if they keep down this road I could tell in high school where these different groups were likely going to go some appealed to me, some did not appealed to me and even in high school if you have the right frame of mind you can actually start to learn the biggest problem with that is right you don't we need to what as human beings there needs to be some discrepancy for us to notice it right we need to there's some contrast there was a big enough contrast that even my dumbass at whatever 22 or 23 years old went oh I see what's going on I see what's going on and that second that second platoon commander the good one that's actually the seed that started in my mind of oh he's an officer he was enlisted like me I'm enlisted like he was maybe I could become an officer just like this when I wouldn't even imagine that it wasn't even something that I thought I wasn't like and then we ended up with the most humble and knowledgeable and square the way platoon commander and the attitude that we had with the arrogant guy we would I don't think we sabotaged on a regular basis but there was like subcont, like we'd be doing a mission a training mission that he had forced his planned out our throat we didn't want that thing to succeed we wanted to prove him wrong that was always a conscious thing I think most of the time it was subconscious but no doubt we didn't want to follow him and think about how disturbing that is you're in a seal platoon and the platoon commander there's not one single guy in the entire platoon that actually wants to follow that guy and this is the frame of my thing I had to trace this back You don't need to elevate the statue everybody knows who the boss is the chain of commanders understood everybody's got that hierarchy What you actually need to do is look for ways to break down those barriers and just have them recognize all that's got cares about us winning That's all he cares about and by behavior after behavior after behavior eventually you either do it or you're not and if you're doing it people are gonna get on board if you're not you're going to fail no matter what you do and people are gonna see that on my way Smell it on you This continues on it is obvious that building a trustworthy relationship with your superiors is important But how do you do that one of the simplest ways is obvious but often gets overlooked that is performance Your boss expects you to complete certain tasks so complete them do them on time on budget and with a little as little drama as possible get the mission done This includes doing things you might not be 100% in agreement with I did this throughout my career and it always served me well Boss wants me to fill out semester paper work cool. and then I get into the laws of combat and the principles of leadership and pretty pretty straightforward like a review you know cover move simple prioritized next you and the central is coming up I'll tell you what though as I'm right not down it's interesting because now you know we've traveled the world we've taught these principles over and over again to people and teams and organizations of every imaginable kind and it's these things apply the biggest question I get when I'm when we're working is how do you apply they understand what they mean and you can say those words and they can define them and explain them and the question people always have is how do I apply this and those those three the stories of those three pletunes and then when you kind of basically you review and you know it's really what sets the stage for how these where these fit and how to look for where they fit I mean even that story about the pletune commander of whether or not you should have made the call and especially when you and then when you say like we're gonna build trust with the boss It's like man that's like I have no argument to that like when I'm saying I don't want to build trust with the boss Unless you just some like anti team member, you know and I think that the way people learn things for the first time it leaves a mark on people and it's very hard to change their minds so you gotta be careful with that there's probably so is there a bias around that echo trails like an official bias like the way you learn something for the first time are you always biased towards thinking that's correct is that an official type of bias but it's very possible possible bias I think that's really hard to undo really hard to undo I saw that all throughout my career and a whole bunch not just in flying a whole bunch of different things people route their heads around that and I was super lucky again see that's talking about lack a lot so I was a priori listed guy when I was an assistant platoon commander the only person in my platoon at seal team two that had more experience than me was the platoon chief who is another guy from team one that we kind of grew up together in the teams he was he was a little bit more he'd been in the teams a little bit longer than me but not too much longer so we were like the experience the guys when I was a platoon commander same thing like I was when my platoon chief had been in for probably an extra six months longer than me but after that it was just a bunch of you know basically guys that had been for six years we'd been in for 13 or 14 done anyone else a task commander right the front facing juggle they don't understand the backside and what's going on behind the in the rear facing That type of hyper aggressive take no prisoners mentality is certainly simple and straightforward Which is often the kind of leadership advice that people expect from me and what they want to hear Because that attitude is so simple and straightforward it hardly seems it could fail and often that attitude doesn't fail At least not at first A heavy handed and hostile approach usually works for a little while you may be able to budget people into doing what you want them to do for a day or two maybe a week Maybe even a solid few months perhaps you can force a couple projects to completion through ruthless and aggressive offense But those successes will be short lived as you trash relationships burn bridges and leave scorched earth in your wake You will soon look up and realize you are done you have destroyed everything for short term gain you have nothing left That last part is so important the chain of command actually works and you can utilize the chain of command all you want and you can get things done I can just force the outcome I can if I am in charge of you by rank or position or title I can force that The lesson that needs to take with that will work until it doesn't My boss will know that I am the person who can make things happen and more important I gain cloud with the boss This is the opposite of the subordinate who complains and objects or always thinks he has a better way to do things he loses influence with the boss every time he opens his mouth Any objection from that subordinate is seen by the boss as another typical excuse the more you talk the less people listen On the other hand when I do what needs to be done The boss trust that I can make things happen the boss also knows that if I do raise an objection It is likely to be founded on solid facts that should be considered Since I get things done and don't constantly voice my objections the boss actually listens I always utilize this strategy with my senior leadership and it worked well I was an idiot in high school and I didn't have the right frame of mind I can't control those lessons but if you actually have just enough a tiny bit of willingness to just kind of pay attention you don't have to be in the seal team to get these same lessons they're all out there in life everywhere and that would be people who are always asking if you could go back and do it over again what would you change I usually say nothing I actually would try to tell young they'd work you're frame of mind just pay a little more attention when it's going to run you because it's all out there even in high school, it's all there man I got asked this the other day I was getting interviewed or something and I've been asked it before and it's a similar kind of concept the question was like what was the moment where this all kind of came together oh my people are all different and the way I treat this one guy and relate to this one guy doesn't work in every situation and when you talk about that too is when you look at other people's plans because egos always the biggest issue with every client we work with it's always egos at the top and the question that's best how important is this plan to that other person because if that other person has to do this plan the worst thing you can do is fight them on the plant no matter whatever the quality of the plan is and even having the humility of saying hey in this situation it isn't even about what is the best plan it's what's the best way to implement the plan because if I prove that I'm right and my plan is better and this guy has to admit to me in act with us so good times how up when I got done with buzz I checked into sealed team one it was fired up as all of us were who were checking into that sacred place of war heroes and legends the master chief of the command the highest ranking and listed seal at team one welcome to support no one here cares that you made it through buzz we all did it doesn't mean anything here you have to prove yourself and earn your try it so keep your mouth shut your ears open and don't forget anything and be on time any questions the try it was the golden signal worn on the uniform which indicates you are sealed to receive our try we had to go through a six month probationary period and then go through a written and oral review board with the senior and listed personnel at the team we were all nervous about that and the master chief provided no comfort whatsoever in the early 90s and again I'm skipping through chunks of the book just to kind of get to the meat in the early 90s when I got to sealed team one the training progression was different from how it is now back then once on board a team you were eventually assigned to a sealed platoon this is where you would actually learn to be a seal up until that point the training wasn't tackle and buzz you don't learn very much about the actual job of being a seal you learn how to be called wet and tired and miserable and not to complain about any of it no this is not much better than yours and bones forced them to do it right there and not only during that plan they might not do their best but in the future you're like the guy who's like all you just think your plan is better so even in the future he might not have your back is much why would you even why are you even going to put forth that effort echo if when you brought me a plan that was a level nine yeah good plan a good plan yeah that's kind of the point there where like you got to be careful with that kind of stuff where like if if I'm trying to build a relationship like probably can see what you're doing you know, Like because again, this is part of that to be careful with it. but you may be not sabotage but by just doing nothing when actually what you need them is to do the exact opposite that which is totally being the game so even as you read those reviews as first three to set the stage and even the review of eo and that kind of manker how many times you read those books read it in this context because it changes in your mind how they apply to the world that you care about which is your world which doesn't have to be the seal teams it's not what this is about it just that's the backdrop it's actually work work fits in whatever world that you're in not to mention the future by the way like you know how you if you have a better plan they have a good plan you have a better you have a level 10 this guy's a level nine but I usually wasn't and my grades reflected that I was average across the board coming out strong coming out strong average across the board that's where we're at and this is where it kind of ties in so even from a young age I needed to get others with more talent and more skill to do what I needed them to do I needed to lead of course I didn't think of it as leadership I just thought I was making things happen in contributing by getting people to work together to support one another as we moved toward a common mission now maybe that mission was building a fort in the woods or planning a mock military assault with squirt guns on another group of friends and this is real like I remember when I was when it was time to build a fort when it was time to organize an assault on some other group I do like I hate this is what we need to do but I had more time you're about to have more time I had more experience and those experiences early on opened up and put me in the right frame of mind luckily so what what I do then in this in this book I go through these first three seal ptons which are very there's this kind of does this happen I guess it happens and everything when you learn something for the first time but this happens and the teams all the time the way people learn something for the first time is the way they think it's correct forever for sure and it takes like a beat down to get it out of them but how do we actually fire these principles how do we execute them all right next section and again I know we didn't coordinate about which sections to talk about and there's a ton of sections I just try to I just kind of was going through going on this one this one would be good but skipping here this one is called the power of relationships the power relationships and this is one of those things one of those things you hear all the time right relationships are important but like the rest of the new guys I listened and learned every single day in my first three platoons I learned a few key concepts that stuck with me for the rest of my career and they were also the base upon which I built most of the principles I ended up teaching to the rest of the seal teams and eventually to companies businesses and organizations around the globe these are examples of the lucky moments I referred to earlier I was in the right place at the right time with the right frame of mind to learn what I did then I was lucky enough to have it other experiences to overlay what I had learned and slowly subconsciously begin to formulate a system of leadership that I was then lucky enough to apply on one of the most challenging battlefields in the world the Battle of Amadi in the summer of 2006 when I returned from that deployment I took over the training for the West Coast seal teams where I formalized, codified and transcribed what I had learned but the roots of everything I eventually wrote down originated in a very non-traditional but highly effective learning environment the seal platoon so that's the opening kind of a little what is it? yeah it's interesting how as I reflect back just being on the outside gave me maybe the initial idea of being detached and looking at things from a different perspective only because I wasn't quite one of those any of those groups interesting alright continuing on joining the Navy was still the best thing I could have done he gave me a blank slate and clear direction known in the Navy care that I didn't have the best grades in high school it didn't matter that I wasn't the best athlete known as concerned about where I was from what my parents did or anything else about my history they shaved my head gave me a uniform and told me what I needed to do to be successful make your bed like this soldier underwear like that polish your boom knockers until they look like mirrors if you could follow the rules and do what you told to do you'd be putting a leadership position I did follow the rules and I kind of had to do a little bit of an explanation here in the beginning of the book just to explain sort of what's going on here who I am what well it goes like this who am I to try and teach leaders how to lead where did I learn leadership much of my leadership education was luck I say luck because there were a few fortunate coincidences that gave me the right frame of mind the right teachers and the right opportunities to learn one of the ways I was lucky and that made me focus on leadership was the fact that I wasn't really that naturally talented at anything in particular as a little kid I wasn't the fastest or strongest or smartest I was never great at shooting a basketball kicking a soccer ball or throwing a baseball I didn't win any races or have a shelf of trophies and ribbons from sports my report card was never exceptional either I'm not a done well in a class if I was interested but you were actually lucky that your boss in that very first story didn't crush you and just destroy it and wipe out the opportunity to learn that lesson when you made that call because some bosses could have just worn you down and put you in a position you're actually lucky that on that second platoon that mutiny story you're actually lucky in some ways that they let you know that we don't do this there's other layers of things in there we had a bad boss and a good boss that you had the frame of mind and we keep saying that over and over again and you didn't get validated like You ever you're fine people when people say, I'm I'm learning, you know, like almost like it's like almost like a cop out for their bad behavior. It doesn't work and what's really cool and this is all the like the closing of the book is what we're getting to right now is if you want to if you want to have a successful Run as a leader and you want to rise to the top The best possible way to do that is to care about your team care about the mission take care of them and that will show through and eventually you will get to the top If you're if you're sitting there thinking hey, I want to get to the top So we are just going to do it and let me tell you what else we're doing by getting this done We are building trust with the boss every one of these little tasks from him that we crush Allow him to trust us more and more and that gives us the ability to get listen to So when something comes up that really doesn't make sense he will listen That is why we are going to execute this plan to the absolute best of our ability There you go, exo charge your next question just got preemptively answered no more questions you're welcome That's the part see that's the part where people get worried and that's the answer people get worried Who are the guys gonna think yeah, So if if somebody knew me from like the periphery from like the outside looking in kind of saw tasking a bruiser or saw my platoon or saw me at trade at They would kind of get this idea like okay, you know, this is this you know, that's how juggle cut rolls but that seems like a bad call for me he got his commission or he was ready to get his commission now who knows because everyone in boot camp lies to each other when it comes to like you know you meet all these guys that were out just there I was just about to be you know got just got drafted by whatever the Miami dolphins I really wanted to serve so I've been listed in the Navy looking at that guy thinking and I kind of wanted to give a dramatic you know a dramatic answer, a poignant answer I remember it was a rainy day I was like no, the every one of these things is a slow build and like you don't even know you don't have the right frame of mind, right? but there are undoubtedly some folks I guarantee that are seeing this and go to Holy Crap without this my life would be different and there's so a whole bunch of people that you can hit it over the head and they're knocking absorbent that they have their own timelines but you can see when people get dialed in and in the military I mean those culminating events like you're just talking about you get a couple of them in your career you get maybe two or three if you're lucky some people get one lot of people don't get any I'm in touch with a pretty good number of guys going through the basic school and social media and they are so much more dialed in than I ever was so much more dialed in and I'm gonna come to the conclusion like do this is legit that guy that guy that guy cares about everybody else being successful and then those are Look your people are gonna need you at times and there you will have opportunities to build relationships but the authenticity isn't just what do I say to echo to get echoed a like mirror very favorite with echo because actually what you're doing to to to your leader is you're watching everything they're doing and the reason being fake about it doesn't work Isn't because I just see it with me That's a short term and like I like we said earlier, that's like a brute force that can work for a little while like I could be like okay, Dave. oh oh when I'm talking to Dave Dave knows that you know what I care about Dave if that's the underlying if that's the underlying principle on which we're that I'm doing this is because I care about him he's gonna know that that's subconsciously subconsciously and maybe sometimes you got to be a little bit more proactive and make sure that you know someone understands it like I mean and but that's the cool thing about Kyle is like he talked them through it you know he eventually was like good enough to be like hey this is what I really want to do so you know what actually you have even thought you didn't thought through that because if you were to fall through that you'd realize that Wednesday is the day when people are waiting for the podcast if we put it on Tuesday you know what actually don't come to me with any more ideas that don't make any sense whatever validate them through common sense before you approach me because it's actually a waste of my time it's a waste of your time it makes you look stupid that's what a brow beater is that's a brow beater that's a brow beater that's the understanding And I'm going to do exactly that hey boss we're going to accomplish that mission let's go make that happen and then do like you said all those things what you should be planning for is is that second scenario because that's going to happen throughout your career all the time scenario number one almost never. like oh there it is I got this it was like this is where the seed got planted and it started to grow the first platoon it was called detach it was in my first platoon that I learned the power of being able to detach myself from the chaos and may I'm going on take a step back and see what was actually happening I was lucky that it happened the way that it did and yet people make people absolutely make that mistake time and time again the other thing about this that's interesting or if you want to take up like another perspective of it is if my goal into going into a conversation is to improve my relationship with you does that make me some kind of a fake person If you're trying to do this for yourself It's not gonna work if you're trying to do this because you care about the team it's gonna work and you're gonna win you personally are gonna win If you do this if you do this because you want to win you're gonna lose you do this because you want to take care of those people and want the team the way so when you read this I mean you have to read every line every every piece of that because there's a there's a take away from each one of those the contrast is there if you if you know to look for it and the biggest problem certainly for me and sure but is you just don't know to look for it and luckily those things happen with enough contrast for you to recognize even look back on it you got to you got to know to look for it so you got the stereotypical kids right the jock the rebel guy the preppy or the popular girl the nerd and then what was the black hair to grow considered like a recluse like a hermit like outcast artsy right give me artsy arty girl but I'm not I'm not I'm not going I'm not saying hey there's a guest you better be here by nine thirty all set up I just tell you what's up and you know what to do it's true communication understand it understanding the intent Dave Burke maybe doesn't fully qualify as a as a full guest anymore in your mind he's like a hybrid like guest friend he was not quite enough to get here at nine thirty but a solid nine fifty Yeah, let's do it if I want to win if you're a if you're a young leader right now listening to this conversation and thinking about how you can build a relationship in the power of the relationship with your people Actually those individual how you interact with that individual person isn't the biggest thing because what those people in your team are doing is watching you let me tell you how important they are 99.9% of the things that I did in my entire military career were based on relationships and not based on chain of command 99.9% I'm not even I can't remember what the other point one percent is I'm sure it's in there somewhere but 99.9% of the things that I did in my military career were based on relationships so that goes when I'm talking about being the commander of task unit bruiser and we have an operation and life is going to be the assault force commander or the ground force commander on an operation I'm not saying hey, life here's how you're going to do it so I was probably 12 or something where I could get a 10 speed you know with the curve down handlebars and my dad's they can you know you got a bike 3, 4, 6 miles 5 miles whatever you're going to want this 10 speed and of course I'm like and I knew that it was wrong because I had just got done with two art but two is right I did mission after mission and I knew that that was not the right thing to do and the other Vietnam guy said hey man, he's wrong he's wrong just play the game a little bit and the actual thing that he told me was people don't always remember things and I know you know what that means that means like hey that means you're not letting me down it means we're looking bad we don't look bad you know and we see this as well you have a person that was in the military that rose through the ranks and did a good job on paper But was abusive and blunt force trauma and beat down people on his rise up retirees from the military Get out of the military and then all of a sudden gets a job in a civilian sector And doesn't last because as soon as he tries that people are going wait a second You think you're going to be here for the next 10 years. he goes you guys this sounds like a mutiny we don't have mutiny in the silt or in the navy get out of here go to your jobs like that was not a good this is not normal and then luckily that commanding officer was smart enough to actually dig into it further and he relieved the guy got fired he fired him and that is luck commanding officer number one told us shut up do your job and yeah your idea versus my idea and learning that lesson of you know what what's what's the best idea and what do we really try to get done and is the boss whoever that boss is because man it's so easy especially when you're young and you're young you want to do well you want to perform you want to be the guy and I was doing eight count body builders know I was like I'm like I'm rocking all the different like good they're so ridiculously, they're so ridiculously hard I mean everything like you're going to swim in so everything is going to be wet all your radios are going to be and this is before we had water proof radio so everything has to be water proof properly your weapons are going to get trash I think I do I know something or I have seen something or experience something that maybe I haven't and the questioning is what it is actually questioning yourself more than anything is what I know actually correct and that's I think that's part of the reason why it's so hard to undo that is it people are convinced they understand it cool how can I explain these to the rest of these guys that are going to be coming through this training where they can take them in an implemented quickly so unfortunately there's no point now my curiosity is when someone gets fed this information now right when someone that's at the basic school in the Marine Corps listens to the podcast that we did that series of podcasts and goes is that do they get just a a hyper move forward because I look at it and think man if I would have had this podcast when I was younger I'd been a million times in a better position is that do people get a hyper boost do you think? so I get that when this guy says why did you make that call I get the well because you're too slow to make a call or you should have been quicker or you didn't see what was happening or because I'm detached and I see all those little arrogant responses popped up and thankfully I just jerked the collar on that just the chain and said well you're an arrogant right now probably a little bit of that arrogant platoon commander that I had I felt that little I felt that little I felt his spirit in my brain I smashed it with the good with the humility and I did respond saying well you know
