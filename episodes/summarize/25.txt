Oh, you know, whatever, I'd be like hey, you want you to think about it You know remember when you made like for doing making that shot and you missed or whatever like trying visualized Trying to think about what you did you know there's a lot of steps that go into pulling the trigger, you know, and and and then you know Just think about that think about how it happened and and Encourage that you know, I'm I'm a big fan of Meditation and yoga and all that stuff like If any and like I think and our Side of the world we've lost a lot of that stuff so do you do you find you get Because you you know we I don't want to hash out too much, but like your podcast went from non-existent to number one and about like Six days something crazy like that like you you left the Joe Rogan podcast Did you did started your own hit number one and like now like do you get too much correspondence like how do you keep up like I've noticed you are your like you must make Twitter a daily pass. I'm gonna learn as much as I possibly can so you got a long-term mission with your constituents right to be the best City councilman and Represent so when they ask you a question you're like boom that's kind of the course psychos tough that I would say is like if anybody ever asked me a question Like when I was gonna college if I asked me any question about it either reading I'm gonna know it That's just the bizarre What's that OCD thing to be like I'm gonna know everything so you have four kids you train every day You get up at four in the morning. I'm not I'm a I'm a Weekend soft and do stupid things you know, I mean don't put me on a pedestal But put yourself on a pedestal you know put yourself on a pedestal and rise up Your self don't worry about me springboard off my back and go to a higher level That's what I want to see happen that's what I don't want I don't want people to put me on a pedestal I want them to stand on my shoulders and go higher and further than anything I could ever do That's what I like did it take you this is a personal question on my end to take you while to say Like when somebody would say you inspire me and and thank you for being who you are Did you accept that at first or did you have to tell them like don't know they I guess I was doing my best to help the cop a traffic and and stuff like this and And deal with some of the other like minor injuries and The fireman like the first guy to put his head in he's like I kind of heard like well, who is this and then Alo here is Lanna like I need this Yeah, you know That's one of the things that makes that transition so hard Is that you know before I was talking about like combat matters and Then beyond that you're doing this thing You know for your wife like she's in charge of saving people's lives Saving soldiers lives and that's gonna help the strategic mission. and I know we try to get it back and got people that do it are Tree hugging you know, Spandex wearing weirdos or whatever, but yoga and Meditation and stuff like that's all warrior culture from the past You know like samurai meditate You know, eight warrior monks Fasted and prayed that's just meditation and they looked inside themselves a lot to try But yeah, like could you imagine though that's your gig well like we had an embedded EOD guys with us and See what usually have EOD Navy EOD guys right basically like two guys our guys were like they go through our training with us and Suddenly it was an issue for our guys as well Almost every vehicle we had hit a landmine on my tour and that was the only time I was ever really scared over there When I was walking or an helicopter or even out on a four wheeler No problem when I had to drive on the roads in a vehicle That's when I was like my that pucker factor was the highest for me ever IED man like the guys I would go out every day and deal with that shit like IED clearance guys fox man like My hat always came off to those guys. I'm like why is there sugar in the bread and and Like I'll be I'm not I'm like an 80 20 guy whatever that you know the 80% like 80% of time I pretty good 20% of the time. yeah the one One thing that I that's actually a pro I like a really practical thing that I did That in that is I had This again, this is just like a real practical thing I had two cuts Right, it's up to the cot something one caught Something one caught the other caught was all my gear and it was just laid out gun body armor, you know everything was right there and when I When I got dressed to go out All that thing was empty and so Never forgot anything when I came back everything went right back on the cot Same spot everything squared away This is what matters and how you gonna tell yourself that this is what matters It's because this is how it connects to the strategic picture You can't say that this matters because of what it is right in front of me just like when you're looking at the crossroads You're not thinking oh this crossroads is important because the crossroads is Important no the car the reason it's important is because you are supporting keeping guys alive Which is gonna help a mission out which is gonna help the the overall strategy win Commanders intent the commanders intent the whole mind on the commander now You want to man and also what's your long-term mission and that's what kind of you just set yourself like All I picked bodybuilding because I there you just gave yourself a mission So You know you gotta make sure your gear is good you gotta make you know Are your batteries changed right you got like there's all the ways the checklist check list check list check list as a leader It actually makes it easier I found because now I have a reason to check their stuff and Check that their routine so my routine stayed solid right because other I had other guys I had to worry about So rest is a big one I used to have to order my guys to go to ground because they were so because there's only three of us Yeah big time but Put on the best uniform put on you know getting the best shape Polish your boots the highest standard be prepared to get shit on and and and bulldog your way through And smile while you're eating that shit sandwich you know like the doubt is You ever heard that like you ever talked to someone and they talk about what they want they really want to be doing Okay, so I have a I have a buddy of mine. and then I'll see like a retweet with like You know somebody else was watching there's like a thousand watches with like your picture and the air is right next to it And if and I like to eat like if I'm not eating I like to be taking like a shake or something like every three or four hours I just try to intermittent fasting. but you know what you don't need to replace it You don't need to replace it Uh whole stock replace that thing that's a beautiful beautiful experience to have had in your life But don't let it turn into a Black hole right like like the black hole the massive a black hole is some Insane number just like the mass and the and the power of this combat experience is the same thing It's this super powerful experience, but don't let it suck all the other experiences away Don't let it do that Don't let it do that and and so if you eat something and you feel like shit after you know pay attention to that Because that can take a lot of energy away from your workout and just from your date You know like you go roll into work with a headache because you ate something that you're actually allergic to like that can really mess with your mood huh I'm like he's probably on top like You know what he does for a living you know exactly what he does for a living Ops can take a while he's like yeah, You know I tried trying to use them to be stronger and realize like you know like this is real like people are looking up to me and it if contact left and I would try to like you know Visualize these things, you know because as the team leader I had the radio and I was security because my boys when they're in position, you know my spotter is spotting my shooter is shooting so like they're 12 o'clock and he knows who he is And bro, I told you this at the time he said oh, yeah, let's say in a contract for 12 months and this I'm like you know why don't Six months tops and you know if that and he's like why what's the matter? yeah part of the briefings that they gave part of the now there was some close calls Laced platoon and that matter fact it's in the book when they the EOD guys were Watching the front door that couldn't quite keep an eye on it, but they were they did a really good inspection of it when they came back out They like something looks different They went down there and there's 120 millimeter mortar ID that would have taken out out of four or five guys There was a time where we went over we went over an ID will The point man navigator in the vehicles was like hey, I think there's something specific suspicious Actually got out of the vehicle to look at it. And I function best when I have minimum sub like minimum like additions to like You know when you go to the get breakfast right nothing better than bacon and eggs in the morning Until they bring your home fries and they're covered with paprika Montreal spice shit all over them and and then I've kept a real close eye on like so as a kid Like you know when we were eating lunch, I didn't want onions or mushrooms Because as a kid I didn't like them and I found out later as an adult while I'm actually slightly allergic to them Okay, I'm gonna get a little spacey here little earthy Just sit there Because you know what you do when you're a sniper You're fucking sit there you have a lot of time to yourself Can't really talk because you got a job to do and what you gotta do is you just gotta Okay, I know my heart rate's gonna go up here and I think about What I saw I saw a lot of destruction but honestly it was mostly the enemy You know that I caused and I'm like it's easy to step over him like he doesn't look like me. I came home like bench benching like whatever four plates aside is dead lifting like I was like huge we looked awesome. It was an awesome sight of it when my guys when I was a task Get a commander you know I'd be sitting on base as guys were rolling out and I'd stand out there and salute him like just like old school rakes, but it is you know Right, there's not it's it's just making sure you do the same thing over and over and over again, you know as as Magical as Navy seals and snipers want to be like it's not really that It's not that mystical I guess It's so it's just a lot of repetition You know the routine is that you repeat the same actions because that what's meant that's what makes you good at Yeah, I was telling you when we were driving over here or some point how we used to try and do Everything you know I haven't even thought about this until until you were talking about it because I remember what it was like to to go from When I went to college and when I was before I deployed reminding now would just be so laser focused Beacuse build it just burn through things and then when I got back and it was not there and it was all because I thought All this stuff doesn't matter this doesn't matter it doesn't matter what matters you know There's guys getting killed overseas right now. I don't can afford So if anyone is like you know when you're a big part of your routine is is the fact that you have to have the energy and like Just not feel like shit when you when you go into the gym. And it just like just hand you know just hammers because I was getting sick and and like so I'm like what's wrong? I'll tell you another thing that I tell people when they say something like that to me I tell them look there's many people that have done way more than me and sacrificed way more than me 100% and The fact that You think that about me the only reason you think that about me is because you know me You know who I am because I stepped out of the darkness and and into the public view and And you know my best my best buddies You know the the guys that I was happy didn't die in combat I've talked to them every three to six months You know I just talked to the leader of that green bra team that I work so much with just the other day after two years of not actually speaking you know a couple messages on Facebook and this It's weird for me Jody medic you know I want to learn it from someone that's like you if I want to learn how to patrol I want to learn it from someone like you I don't want to learn it from a guy that theoretically understands it Yeah, I just I asked because it took me a while because I I had a real hard time With people looking at me like that and I actually would I would be like dismissive of it at first I'd be like not off what are you doing what are you talking about it?
