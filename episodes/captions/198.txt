[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 198, but David Burke and me, Jockel Willick, good evening,
[00:00:07] David.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:10] And David is back on the podcast because Echo is, well, he's still on vacation.
[00:00:19] And we are continuing the thread that we did on the last podcast with Andrew Paul,
[00:00:27] the last podcast we discussed day, German Field Manual called Trooping Fierong, which means
[00:00:36] leading troops.
[00:00:38] And I mentioned the American version of that document.
[00:00:41] It's called Field Service Regulations FM 100, 5.
[00:00:47] And the one, and this is a little bit, it's not that important, but I'm going to bring
[00:00:52] it up later.
[00:00:53] That we're going to talk about was published in 1941, so prior to the entry of us into World
[00:01:03] War II.
[00:01:05] And they plagiarized heavily from the Trooping Fierong.
[00:01:10] But there are enough differences in here that it does merit.
[00:01:17] It's on review.
[00:01:18] So we're going to look at it.
[00:01:20] We're going to explore leadership once again, Dave.
[00:01:24] Are you ready?
[00:01:25] I'm ready.
[00:01:26] All right.
[00:01:27] Let's go to Field Service Regulations FM 100, 5.
[00:01:34] There's actually a little intro section in here.
[00:01:37] And it goes like this, preface on 22 May 1941, the War Department published a new version
[00:01:45] of FM 105 operations.
[00:01:49] This manual superseded the superseded attempt of 1939 version, which I actually have not
[00:01:54] seen.
[00:01:55] I'll have to dig that one up.
[00:01:56] The most recent official edition had been the Field Service Regulations dated 1923.
[00:02:02] The Army of 1941 desperately needed an up-to-date, doctrinal guidance.
[00:02:07] The world was already engulfed in war.
[00:02:09] And the United States had begun to mobilize.
[00:02:12] Thus the Army was eight times larger than it had been in 1939.
[00:02:18] That's two years.
[00:02:19] 1939 to 1941.
[00:02:20] You want to talk, you know, you and I work with companies now.
[00:02:24] And we're growing a lot.
[00:02:25] We're in a growth phase.
[00:02:27] Eight times bigger in two years.
[00:02:30] And we're not talking about a small organ.
[00:02:31] It's one thing to go from, you know, two people to 16.
[00:02:35] Hey, we're eight times bigger.
[00:02:37] But to go from whatever, a few hundred thousand to over a million, that's serious growth.
[00:02:45] So continuing more over it, it also embarked on a modernization program that affected
[00:02:50] virtually every facet of military activity.
[00:02:53] The edition, the 1941 edition of FM-100, Tac-5 encapsulates the state of Army doctrine on the
[00:03:01] eve of America's entry into World War II.
[00:03:03] The 1941 version of FM-100, Tac-5, has long been recognized as a classic piece of doctrine
[00:03:10] writing.
[00:03:11] Remarkable for its clarity of concept and prose.
[00:03:15] Now come on folks, we can't give you that much credit.
[00:03:19] We just read the German version.
[00:03:21] And we know that we know we're getting this from.
[00:03:24] So that's a little bit of a bold statement there coming from this preface.
[00:03:29] It also has valuable historical, it is also a valuable historical artifact preserving
[00:03:33] as it does the doctrinal thought of the Army at a critical juncture in history.
[00:03:38] And this is signed by Christopher R. Gable PhD historian, combat studies institute, U.S. Army
[00:03:46] command and general staff calls.
[00:03:48] Did you go to work college?
[00:03:50] No, I went to Johns Hopkins instead.
[00:03:52] Oh wait, what do they call you?
[00:03:55] Oh that's right, you deal day.
[00:03:57] Check.
[00:03:58] And what did you study there?
[00:04:02] International public policy.
[00:04:05] How long was it?
[00:04:06] How long was the school?
[00:04:07] About 18 months.
[00:04:08] The academic fellowship, so it was basically civilian.
[00:04:10] Got a master's degree and started working on a second degree while I was there.
[00:04:14] What was the second degree that you started working on?
[00:04:16] MBA.
[00:04:17] Okay.
[00:04:19] The policy, what were you doing?
[00:04:22] Yeah, so really what that was about is the reason why the Marine Corps sent me to do that
[00:04:26] is to, after that was going to go to the Joint Staff to help formulate how we relate
[00:04:32] to other countries and the security that goes along with that and the relationships we have
[00:04:36] with other countries was actually pretty important.
[00:04:38] A lot of those lessons came from World War II and this isolationist mindset didn't help
[00:04:42] us in the beginning and how to form policy that helps the country create security around
[00:04:49] the world really.
[00:04:50] Who are the professors?
[00:04:51] Probably the most prominent professor there was Elliott Cohen.
[00:04:55] He's now the dean at SICE, but he ran the strategic studies department that I was there
[00:05:01] and then John McLaughlin, who was the former acting director of the CIA.
[00:05:05] So some pretty amazing guys there, some pretty great access to some really smart folks.
[00:05:09] It spent their careers in international arena.
[00:05:13] Yeah, that's kind of a...
[00:05:14] Pretty legit.
[00:05:15] So no, I didn't go to work, I'll just...
[00:05:20] Good deal Dave coming in hot.
[00:05:22] All right.
[00:05:23] Now I will say that the Troopin Fierong has a much better kickoff, much better kickoff than
[00:05:30] the... than this one than the field surface regulations, but we're going to jump in.
[00:05:35] Here's where I'm going to pick it up.
[00:05:38] The... the... in fact, this one is so unappic, I'm not reading it.
[00:05:43] Ah, well, now I kind of have to.
[00:05:46] It starts off with with just kind of a blah, blah.
[00:05:50] Field surface regulations.
[00:05:51] It's just... yeah.
[00:05:55] Here's what it says.
[00:05:56] Field FM 100-tack five field surface regulations, operations, is published for the information
[00:06:01] and guidance of all concern.
[00:06:03] It contains the doctrines of leading troops in combat and tactics of the combined arms and
[00:06:07] constitutes the basis of instruction of all arms and services for field surface.
[00:06:11] Okay, that's not bad.
[00:06:12] This is actually decent.
[00:06:13] While the fundamental doctrines of combat operations are neither numerous nor complex,
[00:06:18] their application is sometimes difficult.
[00:06:20] I think we call that simple, not easy.
[00:06:24] That is simple, not easy.
[00:06:26] 100% knowledge of these doctrines and experience in the application provide all commanders
[00:06:32] of firm basis of action in a particular situation.
[00:06:36] So let's think about this.
[00:06:37] This reminds me of what Mattis says.
[00:06:40] Mattis is like, I'm not going to get surprised on the battlefield because I've read
[00:06:43] something close to it.
[00:06:44] I've read something close to it.
[00:06:46] Something I can relate to.
[00:06:47] So knowledge of these doctrines and experience in their application provide all commanders
[00:06:51] a firm basis for action in a particular situation.
[00:06:55] This knowledge and experience enable the commander to utilize the flexible organization
[00:07:01] with which he is provided to group his forces in detasque units most suitable for the
[00:07:06] accomplishment of his mission.
[00:07:10] Now we get what that's saying.
[00:07:13] And it's pretty cold to say.
[00:07:14] It's also very verbose.
[00:07:16] Hey, you got to task organize sometimes.
[00:07:19] You got to have a flexible organization.
[00:07:21] Yes, definitely.
[00:07:23] It goes on and this is where we get we start getting a little bit of fire going here.
[00:07:29] Set rules and methods must be avoided.
[00:07:34] That is probably the last thing that someone would think about the military.
[00:07:39] Right?
[00:07:40] Set rules and methods must be avoided.
[00:07:43] And I'll say I actually think that's a little bit of a strong statement.
[00:07:46] Like you actually have to have standard operating procedures.
[00:07:50] You have to have some rules in place.
[00:07:52] I think maybe that's the kind of statement where you're making it because the common practice
[00:07:59] is to follow set rules so strictly.
[00:08:02] And I'll give you another example.
[00:08:03] So you know what we talk about humility all the time?
[00:08:06] We talk about humility all the time.
[00:08:09] Even though confidence is an equally important trait for a leader to have.
[00:08:14] Why aren't we running around telling people to be confident all the time?
[00:08:17] Because 98% of the time the issue is not people are lack confidence.
[00:08:23] 98% of the time it's that they lack humility.
[00:08:25] So that's why we end up talking about that all the time.
[00:08:28] Hey, you got to be humbly, you got to be humble.
[00:08:30] Because who ends up in leadership positions?
[00:08:32] Right?
[00:08:33] Does somebody that's afraid to step up and isn't confident?
[00:08:35] They don't end up in leadership positions.
[00:08:37] So over years, if we're dealing with the CEO of a company or we're dealing with a unit
[00:08:43] commander in the military or a team leader in any organization, they got there for years
[00:08:51] of being confident for sure.
[00:08:53] That's how they ended up there.
[00:08:54] So and it worked for them and not only exacerbates and magnifies their confidence, which
[00:09:02] is good.
[00:09:03] But when they get to a point where all of a sudden they start believing their own hype
[00:09:07] and that's where it becomes a problem.
[00:09:08] So 98% of the time the problem that we're dealing with isn't a lack of confidence is
[00:09:15] a lack of humility.
[00:09:16] Now where this changes is when we're dealing with a young junior officer that feels
[00:09:20] like they're insecure, they don't really know what they should do.
[00:09:23] And they need to have confidence.
[00:09:26] And the confidence that they actually need is the confidence to say, hey, you know what,
[00:09:30] sergeant or hey, you know what, forming on a job site, I don't really know how to do
[00:09:35] this.
[00:09:36] Can you guide me through it?
[00:09:37] That's the only confidence they need.
[00:09:38] They don't know how to do the actual thing.
[00:09:40] Yeah.
[00:09:41] They just need to, they just need to have the confidence that they can say, I don't get it.
[00:09:47] And it won't undermine their credibility as a leader to admit that they don't know what
[00:09:50] to do.
[00:09:51] No, it doesn't undermine it at all.
[00:09:53] So what they're saying here is you got these military folks that are always following
[00:09:57] the rules.
[00:09:58] That's kind of the, that's the lean.
[00:10:00] That's the tendency.
[00:10:01] The tendency is military guy, you got to told to do something, you're going to do
[00:10:05] it.
[00:10:06] What they're saying is leaning, getting pulling back the other direction a little bit harder
[00:10:10] to balance the dichotomy a little bit as set rules and methods must be avoided.
[00:10:15] And then it continues.
[00:10:16] They limit imagination and initiative, which are so important in the successful prosecution
[00:10:22] of war.
[00:10:26] They provide the enemy a fixed pattern of operations, which he can more easily counter.
[00:10:32] Yeah, which he can exploit.
[00:10:33] Right.
[00:10:34] So you're doing the same thing over and over again.
[00:10:36] Cool.
[00:10:37] Watch this.
[00:10:38] We'll be waiting for you.
[00:10:39] And now we get to the point where I was kind of like, well, what this book starts
[00:10:43] off with is basically, you know, you know, you get a legal document and it starts off with
[00:10:47] the definition of all the terms.
[00:10:48] That's what this starts off with.
[00:10:50] Theodore War comprises this.
[00:10:51] Theodore operations is that.
[00:10:52] Combat zone is this.
[00:10:54] Communication zone is that.
[00:10:55] And so it goes through a bunch of sort of tactical terms, which is fine.
[00:11:00] I mean, they're necessary.
[00:11:03] But that's kind of where this thing starts off.
[00:11:05] Whereas the troop in fearing starts off with just the most legit intro.
[00:11:10] Here's, here's number one from the troop in for the conduct of war is an art, depending
[00:11:16] upon free, creative activity scientifically grounded.
[00:11:22] It makes the highest demands on the personality.
[00:11:26] That's how that one starts off.
[00:11:28] This one I'll read because these are both numbered the same way.
[00:11:30] That's how much they ripped it off.
[00:11:32] They're both kind of every single paragraph throughout is numbered.
[00:11:35] This one starts off with theater of war comprises those areas of land, sea and air, which
[00:11:39] are or may become directly involved in the conduct of war.
[00:11:42] Week.
[00:11:43] Week.
[00:11:44] We didn't want that.
[00:11:45] That's not what we were looking for.
[00:11:47] So then finally, in chapter two, it starts to step up a little bit.
[00:11:53] And you're going to start.
[00:11:54] This is where you're going to start hearing some of the same stuff.
[00:11:57] A little bit different.
[00:11:58] Translated a little bit differently.
[00:12:01] Here we go.
[00:12:02] One arm wins battles.
[00:12:07] The combined action of all arms and services is essential to success.
[00:12:11] The characteristics of each arm and service adapt it to the performance of its special
[00:12:16] function, the higher commander coordinates and directs the action of all, exploiting their
[00:12:21] powers to attain the ends sought.
[00:12:25] So we have to work together.
[00:12:26] We have to cover move for each other.
[00:12:29] It's important to remember, you're not going to win alone.
[00:12:33] That's also why they say there's no set answer for this.
[00:12:35] You don't know what arm or which component you have is going to be the one that you're
[00:12:38] going to use.
[00:12:39] And if I set it at SOP says in this situation, you do this every single time.
[00:12:42] You're going to lose every single time.
[00:12:44] Because there is no prescribed way to do it.
[00:12:45] There's just a framework and understanding how they work.
[00:12:48] And the art is what do I do now?
[00:12:50] This is also an interesting.
[00:12:51] If you break this down to a really granular level.
[00:12:55] And this is a question that has come up before, to me, you've got a person that's naturally
[00:13:00] good at something, but they're really not naturally good at something else.
[00:13:04] What do you do?
[00:13:05] According to this, what you do is you exploit their powers.
[00:13:08] You take advantage of what they're good at.
[00:13:10] Of course, it doesn't mean, if I've got Dave Burke who's really good at interacting
[00:13:15] relationships with a client, but you're horrible at paperwork, I don't assign you to
[00:13:22] be in charge of the paperwork and not let you start to client.
[00:13:24] It wouldn't make you better.
[00:13:26] No, I want to take advantage of what you're good at.
[00:13:29] I will still say, hey, Dave, man, you've got to get better paperwork.
[00:13:33] You've got to get better paperwork.
[00:13:34] I'm not going to have you running it, but you've got to get better at it.
[00:13:38] And you're like, cool.
[00:13:39] And over time, you do get better at it.
[00:13:41] But it's not.
[00:13:42] And then I got someone else that's awesome at paperwork, but they're not good at communications.
[00:13:48] Well, I'm not going to put them in the client facing position.
[00:13:50] I'm going to put them in the back room with a computer bot.
[00:13:54] We are going to work with them.
[00:13:55] We're going to make them get up and talk to some clients so that we do build a more well-rounded
[00:14:01] team.
[00:14:02] Yeah, for sure.
[00:14:03] You actually don't know when that person who is weak at this one thing might need
[00:14:07] to rely on that for organizational success.
[00:14:10] You can't ignore that.
[00:14:11] Yeah, in a sealed position, I mean, every, okay, you've got your corpsmen, your medic.
[00:14:16] The corpsmen obviously is the go-to guy who's carrying the med gear and is trained at an
[00:14:21] incredibly advanced level.
[00:14:22] But every single person knows how to put out a turn-to-kit, knows how to stop the bleeding.
[00:14:25] I've used how to do an IV, and knows how to do a needle-down decompression.
[00:14:29] We all get that training.
[00:14:30] We can make it happen.
[00:14:31] Yep.
[00:14:32] Same thing with cons.
[00:14:33] Same thing with everyone.
[00:14:34] Everybody knows how to shoot that, that pig gun.
[00:14:37] Everybody in the squad, everyone in the platoon knows how to do that.
[00:14:41] Everybody's going to need a note of program the radio.
[00:14:43] Yes indeed.
[00:14:44] True statement.
[00:14:45] All right, now what it does now is it breaks down every sort of arm that we're talking
[00:14:54] about.
[00:14:55] We're talking to arms, the different no-one arm wins battles.
[00:14:56] It breaks down every arm, it breaks down cavalry, field artillery, co-star-tiltary, air
[00:15:00] corps, engineer, signal corps, chemical warfare.
[00:15:04] Because remember, this is coming off of World War I.
[00:15:08] I'm not going to cover all those, but I will look at infantry.
[00:15:11] Because it just says a couple things about infantry.
[00:15:14] The infantry is essentially an arm of close combat.
[00:15:19] Its primary mission in the attack is to close with the enemy and destroy your capture room,
[00:15:23] in defense to hold its position and repel the hostile attack.
[00:15:27] Infantry fights by combining fire movement.
[00:15:31] I think we call that cover move, and shock action.
[00:15:36] Sometimes people use words that I need to completely embed into my vocabulary.
[00:15:41] Shock action is one of those things.
[00:15:44] By fire, it inflicts losses on the enemy and neutralizes his combat power.
[00:15:49] By movement, it closes with the enemy and makes its fire more effective.
[00:15:55] By shock action, it completes the destruction of the enemy in close combat.
[00:16:02] Amen.
[00:16:04] Totally.
[00:16:07] But then we got a little butt here, because we all love infantry, but here we go.
[00:16:13] Infantry is capable of limited, independent action through the employment of its own weapons.
[00:16:20] Its offensive power decreases appreciably when its freedom to maneuver is limited or
[00:16:25] when it is confronted by an organized, defensive position.
[00:16:29] That's why as much as I love infantry, you have to have the supporting arms.
[00:16:36] When you capture the enemy in the combined arms dilemma, that is the glory of warfare.
[00:16:43] You know what was crazy?
[00:16:46] I don't remember when I first heard the term the combined arms dilemma.
[00:16:50] And for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, it's when the enemy or when
[00:16:54] you are attacking the enemy from multiple different weapon systems, and no matter what they do,
[00:17:01] they're trapped, they're on a dilemma.
[00:17:03] If they move one direction, they're going to hit with one type of weapon.
[00:17:07] If they move in another direction, they're going to hit with another.
[00:17:09] If they go to ground and hide, then the infantry is going to move in.
[00:17:11] You've got them in the combined arms dilemma.
[00:17:13] This is what it is.
[00:17:14] You know what it essentially?
[00:17:15] It's a checkmate.
[00:17:16] That's a checkmate.
[00:17:17] That's exactly right.
[00:17:18] That's exactly right.
[00:17:19] What's interesting is, and what was scary was in Ramadi, the enemy would trap coalition forces
[00:17:27] in the combined arms dilemma.
[00:17:29] And so they would initiate perhaps by dropping mortars onto a little outstation.
[00:17:38] When you're getting mortared, what you have to do is you have to get overhead cover.
[00:17:43] So now when you get overhead cover, you're basically hiding.
[00:17:46] When you're hiding, then they come out with machine gun fire.
[00:17:49] They start shooting machine guns because they can expose themselves, they can start shooting
[00:17:53] machine guns.
[00:17:54] While the machine guns, you can you can shoulder and shoot a machine gun very rapidly.
[00:17:58] So while that's happening, now you're essentially pinned down.
[00:18:04] Now they come out with the rockets because they take a little bit longer to aim.
[00:18:08] They're more, you know, an RPG takes a little bit more time to aim and you're more exposed.
[00:18:12] There's back blasts deal with.
[00:18:13] So it's a little bit harder to weapon to handle.
[00:18:15] So it takes a little bit more time.
[00:18:17] But when you're getting cover fire from a machine gun, you got that time.
[00:18:22] So then they can come the rockets.
[00:18:23] Now while this is happening, here comes the vehicle born idea and now everyone's heads
[00:18:29] are down.
[00:18:30] Explosions are going off and while this is happening, a vehicle born ID now closes in, makes
[00:18:37] it through the serpentine and blows up inside of one of these little outposts that happened.
[00:18:44] Multiple times while we're in the body and these little outposts, these little checkpoints,
[00:18:49] these little ECPs would be in several cases overrun.
[00:18:54] Yeah.
[00:18:55] The enemy also evolved while we were there too and we started to see them account for
[00:19:00] what they knew our normal reaction would be.
[00:19:03] We understand what a combined arms element is and the other thing that they did that made
[00:19:06] that situation so hard was they would interact with the civilians.
[00:19:12] So they knew our normal response.
[00:19:13] If you wanted to get on your heavy machine guns and lay down a base of fire, there was so
[00:19:17] much risk at injuring civilians that we had to account for and they knew that.
[00:19:21] So they made our normal response to that so much more difficult and they added that additional
[00:19:26] layer of complexity for us so we had limited options and they took full advantage of that.
[00:19:30] And those those V-Bids, those fuel laden, you know, trash trucks and things like that.
[00:19:36] Those things that they did and watch them get better accounting for what they knew we
[00:19:39] would do made it even harder for us and they look, they got good at that and it was really
[00:19:44] really tough.
[00:19:45] And taking it well again, adaptation, if you recall, when, well, when I first got there,
[00:19:53] they would do one of those attacks at a time.
[00:19:56] Yeah.
[00:19:57] There was a couple days where they did two or three of those attacks simultaneously in
[00:20:03] different parts of the city because then they knew, hey, they're going to overwhelm our
[00:20:06] casualty evacuation.
[00:20:07] They're going to overwhelm our fire support.
[00:20:09] They're going to overwhelm our QRF.
[00:20:11] So they were good.
[00:20:12] Yeah, they were good.
[00:20:13] The combined arms dilemma, it's a positive thing when you put somebody in it.
[00:20:18] It's a negative thing when it happens to you.
[00:20:19] By the way, just, I mean, it's worth noting that when you're doing GJ2, you're looking for
[00:20:24] the same thing.
[00:20:25] You're looking to set up a triangle, arm lock, sweep combined arms dilemma.
[00:20:33] You've got three things.
[00:20:34] If they defend one, you're going to catch them in the other.
[00:20:36] You've got them in checkmate.
[00:20:38] That's what you're trying to do.
[00:20:40] All right, now after that, like I said, this whole next section, it just explains each
[00:20:50] one of the various arms that we have, you know, from like I said, from cavalry to field artillery
[00:20:59] and boy, it was a happy and remodied when we were able to use field artillery.
[00:21:04] That was, that was awesome.
[00:21:06] I mean, it was awesome to, to tanks and field artillery.
[00:21:12] There's not too many people in modern warfare that get to do that.
[00:21:16] Yeah, I got to control some artillery.
[00:21:18] I think it was like the two to F.A. and they didn't, we didn't get to use them a lot, but
[00:21:21] man, they were so dialed in when we called for them.
[00:21:23] They were ready to go, getting to use them was awesome.
[00:21:27] Because it wasn't that common, but when we did, man, they were so dialed in.
[00:21:31] Yeah, I remember the most, I remember they fired a ton of a loom.
[00:21:35] We were doing a big night operation.
[00:21:37] I think it was when we were pushing into like a cop iron.
[00:21:41] Springfield maybe something like that.
[00:21:42] And they just, they just put up a little for a solid 45 minutes.
[00:21:46] It was so epic.
[00:21:49] And it was because the Iraqi soldiers couldn't, didn't have night vision.
[00:21:53] So hey, let's get them, let's get them to be able to see.
[00:21:55] So it covers that, it covers the, what do they call it?
[00:21:59] Coastal, Coast artillery core.
[00:22:02] They cover the air core, which is pretty short and we'll get into that later.
[00:22:10] Pretty World War II air was not a huge element in warfare.
[00:22:16] In World War II, it was in many, in many cases, the biggest part of warfare.
[00:22:23] So some battles were almost pure warfare.
[00:22:26] We're air warfare.
[00:22:27] I mean, a lot of those naval battles were, I don't know, what percentage, but a
[00:22:32] massive percentage was air warfare.
[00:22:34] The battle of Britain, the battle of Britain was 100% air warfare.
[00:22:40] So, and we'll talk about some of the changes that happened in 1944 when they rewrote
[00:22:46] this thing.
[00:22:47] So then they talk about the signal core.
[00:22:48] They talk about chemical warfare.
[00:22:49] So they cover all those things and again, kind of lay out what they are and what's important
[00:22:57] about them.
[00:22:59] And then they finally get into chapter three, which is called leadership.
[00:23:07] And now they get, they get some credit right now because they're coming out strong, strong.
[00:23:13] Maybe even stronger than our German friends over here in the Tupenturon, opening line,
[00:23:20] chapter three, leadership.
[00:23:23] Leadership is based on knowledge of men.
[00:23:28] So you're understanding human nature is what you have to do if you're going to be in leadership
[00:23:32] position.
[00:23:33] That's what we're talking about.
[00:23:34] That's what we've been talking about.
[00:23:37] That's what we talk about all the time.
[00:23:40] And that's not just leadership in war.
[00:23:41] That's leadership everywhere.
[00:23:43] That's what business, everything, that's exactly how it's, it's people.
[00:23:47] It's men.
[00:23:48] And that is, that's why when I went to college, we were talking about your college, where
[00:23:57] you studied policy, right?
[00:24:01] I studied men.
[00:24:03] And I did, and I did it because I was reading books.
[00:24:07] And I'll tell you, I've said this before, the guy that understands human nature, I think
[00:24:14] maybe better than anyone else, Shakespeare.
[00:24:18] It's crazy as that sounds.
[00:24:20] You start diving into those books.
[00:24:22] He understood people.
[00:24:24] There's a lot of lessons to be learned.
[00:24:26] At some point in my life, I'm going to do every Shakespeare play.
[00:24:33] I'm going to cover it all because there's so many lessons in each one of those.
[00:24:39] We'll get there.
[00:24:40] All right, continues on.
[00:24:42] And it's where we go.
[00:24:44] We're still, we're still staying strong right now.
[00:24:48] Man is the fundamental instrument in war.
[00:24:51] Other instruments may change, but he remains relatively constant.
[00:24:56] Unless his behavior and elemental attributes are understood, gross mistakes will be made in
[00:25:01] planning operations and in troop leading.
[00:25:05] In training the individual soldier, the essential considerations are to integrate individuals
[00:25:11] into a group and establish for that group a high standard of military conduct and performance
[00:25:17] of duty without destroying the initiative of the individual.
[00:25:24] Yes.
[00:25:27] Is there much more to say?
[00:25:29] That should just be read over and over again.
[00:25:32] And how hard the balance is for a leader to cultivate that and to allow that to happen
[00:25:38] and how critical that is.
[00:25:40] Because without either of those, you simply cannot be successful.
[00:25:43] I can't remember if it was life or JP at the muster was telling a story about how they
[00:25:50] were watching, it was life.
[00:25:52] He was out watching when he was the ops officer at a seal team.
[00:25:56] He was out watching the training.
[00:25:58] I was putting the guys through training.
[00:26:00] And all K. also is breaking loose.
[00:26:01] It was total mayhem.
[00:26:02] It was an urban environment.
[00:26:05] And there was no leadership happening.
[00:26:08] Leaders were all just overwhelmed.
[00:26:12] And he sees me walk over to this young kind of pipeting E5 who I've been watching him.
[00:26:19] I've been tracking him.
[00:26:20] And I can see that he's good.
[00:26:22] He's a good aggressive.
[00:26:27] He's a natural leader.
[00:26:28] And I walk over to him and he's holding like a saw.
[00:26:31] And I was like, bro, you know what I'm like, bro, what's going on?
[00:26:35] He's like, we need to get out of here and I was like, make it happen.
[00:26:39] And you can see his eyes, he's kind of questioning because you know, he's, I think he's
[00:26:44] a one cruise wonder.
[00:26:45] I'm like, you make it happen.
[00:26:48] And he's like, okay, and just starts making the call.
[00:26:53] And that right there, at some point, he's initiative as an individual had been beat down.
[00:27:01] And as soon as it was released into the wild, he took charge and made things happen.
[00:27:08] And so it is a hard balance.
[00:27:09] You can't have this dude just out there being rogue and trust me, some of these young
[00:27:13] seals.
[00:27:14] You give him a little indication that they can get after it and they're going to go to
[00:27:20] the end three.
[00:27:21] And I would see that happen too.
[00:27:22] You can get some some kid that's so over the top that they'll just start making, you
[00:27:28] know, trying to make everything happen themselves and they'll get out of control.
[00:27:31] And that'll be bad.
[00:27:33] So yes, this is what it is.
[00:27:36] Understanding behavior, understanding elemental attributes.
[00:27:41] Yeah.
[00:27:42] All right.
[00:27:43] And then it goes on.
[00:27:45] War places a severe test on the physical endurance and moral stamina of the individual
[00:27:51] soldier to perform his duties efficiently.
[00:27:54] He must not only be well equipped and technically trained, but he must also be physically
[00:27:58] qualified to endure the hardships of field service and be constantly fortified by discipline
[00:28:03] based on the high ideals of military conduct.
[00:28:08] We salute you.
[00:28:12] You got to keep that.
[00:28:13] There was you got to keep that physical, the physical readiness.
[00:28:18] You have to have it.
[00:28:19] Yeah, for sure.
[00:28:20] But in the same sentence, they just say the phrase, you know, the moral standard too.
[00:28:25] Like it's, that's a really important thing.
[00:28:30] And it's crazy how these sentences, they're so succinct.
[00:28:33] They're so straightforward, but just how powerful that comment is.
[00:28:35] The physical fitness and the moral standard.
[00:28:37] You have to keep both of those.
[00:28:38] You just those two things.
[00:28:39] Yeah.
[00:28:40] The moral stamina.
[00:28:42] Yeah.
[00:28:43] So easy for that to break down.
[00:28:47] Strong men, inculcated with a proper sense of duty, a conscious pride in their unit,
[00:28:53] and a feeling of mutual obligation to their comrades in the group can dominate and demoralize,
[00:28:58] and dominate the demoralizing influences of battle far better than those in
[00:29:03] but only with the fear of punishment or disgrace.
[00:29:10] Yeah, there's a couple of things I was on Theo Vaughn's podcast yesterday.
[00:29:15] And we were talking about controlling your emotions.
[00:29:18] You know, he's an emotional guy and he was saying he doesn't, he was saying he's
[00:29:21] hilarious, but he was saying he doesn't have any emotion.
[00:29:23] He's not very good emotional memory.
[00:29:26] So when something bad happens, he does something and he gets a bad result and it's horrible.
[00:29:32] And then he'll make the same mistake a week later because he just doesn't remember.
[00:29:35] And then he goes, oh man, I'm so stupid.
[00:29:38] And I was talking about the fact that I tried to figure out because I do consciously
[00:29:46] try and control my emotions.
[00:29:49] Right?
[00:29:50] And I was trying to think of where did that come from?
[00:29:52] Where do you start doing this?
[00:29:54] And the answer is actually pretty straightforward.
[00:29:56] I remember as I got more senior in the SEAL teams.
[00:30:01] Well, when I was junior, I remember this.
[00:30:04] I see a leader lose their temper and think that's not good.
[00:30:07] That's negative.
[00:30:08] That every person in our routine right now is looking to this guy like he's an idiot
[00:30:12] because they're acting that way.
[00:30:15] And then as I got older and got into leadership positions, I realized, oh, if I go negative,
[00:30:23] every one's going negative, if I stay positive, everyone is staying positive, that's a big deal.
[00:30:32] That's where it comes from.
[00:30:34] So then we get to this year and this is so obvious.
[00:30:39] I mean, you know, while I was reading this, I could see your head just nodding in affirmation
[00:30:44] that.
[00:30:46] And this is where there's a split.
[00:30:51] I don't know if it's a split, but there's definitely a frisier of some kind of
[00:30:55] fissure of some kind between people that think, hey, if I bark orders and people fear
[00:31:01] me, I guess it's that one.
[00:31:02] It's fear.
[00:31:03] Do they fear me or do they respect me?
[00:31:04] Do people fear me or do they love and respect me?
[00:31:07] You will get 1,000 times better leadership from people that love you and respect you than
[00:31:11] you will from people that are ready to you.
[00:31:13] Yeah, and that fear and intimidation, you get those short term wins.
[00:31:17] You know, we get the response.
[00:31:18] Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:31:21] Yeah, that worked.
[00:31:22] I got a little tactical, a little tactical victory.
[00:31:24] You and I talked about this all the time, the tactical versus logic.
[00:31:28] And that, that could be addictive.
[00:31:31] I tell you to do something you do it because you're afraid of the retaliation if you don't.
[00:31:36] If I give you any resistance, cool.
[00:31:38] Yeah, let me.
[00:31:39] Get, be, brow beat me.
[00:31:42] Brow beat me down and then all submit to your orders because I just don't want to be
[00:31:47] brow beat anymore.
[00:31:49] And I go and do what you told me to do.
[00:31:50] And you walk away, go and see.
[00:31:52] That's right.
[00:31:53] That's how you lead.
[00:31:54] Yeah, I won.
[00:31:55] That's how you lead.
[00:31:56] That's how you lead.
[00:31:57] That's how you're talking about.
[00:31:58] Probably what happened is he made a aggressive decision.
[00:31:59] One of his leaders came back and crushed him for it.
[00:32:02] And had you not been there.
[00:32:04] That if I was thinking, I actually know what to do here to save the Patoon.
[00:32:08] But I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to get crushed by that guy.
[00:32:11] And those, those teams get wiped out in training.
[00:32:14] Yeah.
[00:32:15] And all, yeah.
[00:32:16] So if you're, if you find yourself in a situation where you feel you need to escalate
[00:32:22] your emotions, you're wrong in 19 different ways.
[00:32:26] We get that question working with the clients all the time.
[00:32:29] And I've got no point in my answers is straightforward when people ask, oh, how do I
[00:32:33] control my emotions?
[00:32:34] And I'm like, well, do you want to win?
[00:32:37] Yeah.
[00:32:38] I'm like a, then control your emotions.
[00:32:39] It's pretty much it because every time you don't, you lose.
[00:32:43] And don't be a robot.
[00:32:44] We know that.
[00:32:45] But that idea of like losing your mind or losing control of yourself.
[00:32:49] The answers I was like, do you like winning?
[00:32:51] Good.
[00:32:52] Stop doing that.
[00:32:53] And you'll win more.
[00:32:54] Yeah.
[00:32:55] And check, continuing.
[00:32:57] In spite of the advances in technology, the worth of the individual man is still decisive.
[00:33:04] The open order of combat accentuates, accentuates his importance.
[00:33:09] Every individual must be trained to exploit a situation with energy and boldness and must
[00:33:14] be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiative and action.
[00:33:21] Is there any more empowerment that a human being needs, then that right there?
[00:33:25] Every individual.
[00:33:28] Every individual must be trained to exploit a situation with energy and boldness and must
[00:33:33] be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiatives and action.
[00:33:39] Again, go back to the monster.
[00:33:42] Our J.P. told the story of how I was like, listen, everyone's going to be relying on you.
[00:33:49] And he was like, hey, I've been I came up on stage afterwards and I said, what J.P. doesn't
[00:33:54] know is I told that to everybody.
[00:33:57] I told that to everyone.
[00:33:58] That's what I was doing was this right here.
[00:34:00] Everyone is going to be counting you.
[00:34:01] And it's the truth.
[00:34:02] It's the truth because if we're in a horrible situation and we need fire support, it's
[00:34:07] the radio man that's going to save us.
[00:34:09] If we're in a firefight and we need to maneuver it's the machine gunners that are going
[00:34:13] to save us.
[00:34:14] If someone gets wounded, it's the corpsman that's going to save us.
[00:34:17] If there's a decision that needs to be made, it's the leaders that are going to save us.
[00:34:20] If we're dealing with the ID credits that EOD guys are going to save us, everyone is that
[00:34:24] person.
[00:34:25] And everyone has to be imbued with the idea that success will depend upon his initiative
[00:34:30] and action.
[00:34:32] We were talking about the one tag three a couple months ago and I'm paraphrasing whether
[00:34:36] there's a line on there that is like every single person on your team is critical.
[00:34:41] And even the most junior person has the ability to destroy your entire plan.
[00:34:47] Something along with the right guys.
[00:34:48] That was classfits right there.
[00:34:49] That was a classfits quote from inside the one three.
[00:34:52] For sure.
[00:34:53] Yeah.
[00:34:54] So they can win or they can lose.
[00:34:57] All right.
[00:34:59] Continuing the dispersion of troops in battle caused by the influence of modern weapons
[00:35:03] makes control more difficult.
[00:35:05] Or he's in within a unit is promoted by good leadership, discipline, pride in the accomplishments
[00:35:10] and reputation of the unit and mutual confidence and comradeship among its members.
[00:35:19] We're not going to be around each other.
[00:35:21] That's not happening.
[00:35:22] Yeah.
[00:35:23] You're on your own out there.
[00:35:26] Leading troops in combat regardless of the echelon of command calls for cool and thoughtful
[00:35:31] leaders with a strong feeling of great responsibility imposed upon them extreme ownership.
[00:35:38] Every level.
[00:35:39] Detach.
[00:35:40] Cool.
[00:35:41] They must be resolute and self-reliant in their decisions energetic and insistent
[00:35:48] in execution and unperturbed by the fluctuations of combat.
[00:35:55] Oh yes.
[00:35:59] Who is I talking to?
[00:36:00] I'll talk to someone lately and they're like, do you get spun up about anything?
[00:36:06] And I'm like, nope.
[00:36:08] What am I going to get spun up about?
[00:36:10] Nothing.
[00:36:11] Yeah.
[00:36:12] Things are going to go bad.
[00:36:13] Yep.
[00:36:14] Things are going to go great.
[00:36:15] Yep.
[00:36:16] That's the way it's going to be.
[00:36:22] Troops are strongly influenced by the example and conduct of their leaders.
[00:36:26] Again, that's the conversation I had with the O yesterday.
[00:36:29] A leader must have superior knowledge.
[00:36:33] That's why we study.
[00:36:35] That's why you read.
[00:36:37] You know, it's funny because Andrew Paul was reading this with Andrew Paul and he's like,
[00:36:40] it's just ridiculous.
[00:36:44] This is Andrew Paul talking.
[00:36:45] It's ridiculous that I didn't read this when I was a young lieutenant in the Sultives.
[00:36:48] And we went through the whole conversation about you talking about getting to stack
[00:36:51] of manuals at the basics.
[00:36:52] Cool.
[00:36:53] Like, hey, I'm going to read them because I have to.
[00:36:54] I'm going to memorize whatever words are in there that I think I'm going to get tested
[00:36:59] on.
[00:37:00] Yeah.
[00:37:01] But that's not what we're doing.
[00:37:04] That's not knowledge.
[00:37:05] This is knowledge.
[00:37:07] So a leader must have superior knowledge.
[00:37:09] Willpower.
[00:37:11] Self-confidence, initiative, and disregard of self.
[00:37:16] There you go.
[00:37:17] A leader must have superior knowledge.
[00:37:20] Willpower, self-confidence, initiative, and disregard of self.
[00:37:25] I like how they had to throw that in there.
[00:37:28] You know what that offsets?
[00:37:29] That offsets self-confidence.
[00:37:31] It offsets willpower.
[00:37:34] It offsets superior knowledge because disregard of self is humility.
[00:37:39] Right?
[00:37:40] Hey, that's what it is.
[00:37:41] I'm not important.
[00:37:43] I don't know everything.
[00:37:45] I'm not overconfident.
[00:37:49] Continuing.
[00:37:50] Any show of fear or unwillingness to share danger is fatal to leadership.
[00:37:56] On the other hand, a bold and determined leader will carry his troops with him no matter
[00:37:59] how difficult the enterprise.
[00:38:03] Mutual confidence between the leader and his men is the surest basis of discipline.
[00:38:10] Now they use trust in the two-printhurum.
[00:38:14] They use the word trust, same type of sentence, but mutual confidence.
[00:38:18] And again, I'm not down there when life is a platoon commander inspecting his
[00:38:26] weapons once a day to make sure that they're being cleaned.
[00:38:29] He knows me.
[00:38:31] I know him.
[00:38:33] He trusts me.
[00:38:34] I trust him.
[00:38:35] That's the best form of discipline.
[00:38:37] Not imposed discipline, but mutual confidence.
[00:38:40] That's the accountability you talk about too.
[00:38:42] I hate.
[00:38:43] The accountability is the recognition of this needs to happen.
[00:38:46] You know that about me because our relationship is strong enough for you to not have to
[00:38:49] wonder if this is important.
[00:38:51] It just gets done because you know what needs to get done.
[00:38:56] To gain this confidence, the leader must find a way to the hearts of his men.
[00:39:01] Here we go.
[00:39:02] Isn't that kind of crazy?
[00:39:04] Here we are.
[00:39:05] We're talking about military operation.
[00:39:06] We're talking 1941.
[00:39:10] 1941, depression is going on.
[00:39:14] People are starving in America.
[00:39:17] And we talk about how soft things are now.
[00:39:21] Well, guess what?
[00:39:22] Here we are, 1941.
[00:39:23] We're talking about to gain confidence, the leader must find the way to the hearts of his
[00:39:29] men.
[00:39:30] This he will do by acquiring an understanding of their thoughts and feelings and by showing
[00:39:35] a constant concern for their comfort and welfare.
[00:39:40] And as one of my heroes, General Muka Yamah said, you got to care about your management.
[00:39:50] You got to care about your men.
[00:39:52] How do they say here?
[00:39:53] Show a constant concern for their welfare and comfort and welfare.
[00:39:55] Yeah, what does that mean?
[00:39:56] You got to care about your men.
[00:39:58] Yeah, for the people listening to this is not some sort of robotic action to you actually
[00:40:03] have to care about your men.
[00:40:04] This is the authenticity of this is probably more critical than anything else because what
[00:40:11] your men will figure out if it's not real, they'll see through that immediately.
[00:40:18] I got a good idea.
[00:40:19] If you don't care about your men, if you don't care about your troops, if you don't
[00:40:22] care about your people, you shouldn't be in the leadership position.
[00:40:25] How's that?
[00:40:27] Leave.
[00:40:28] Go and be a solo entrepreneur or be by yourself.
[00:40:41] A good commander avoids subjecting his troops to useless hardships.
[00:40:46] He guards against dissipating their combat strength and inconsequential actions or harassing
[00:40:50] them through faulty staff management.
[00:40:53] So yeah, can you go, I discipline training, train hard, train how you fight all those things.
[00:40:59] Can you do that too much?
[00:41:00] Yes, you can.
[00:41:03] He keeps in close touch with all subordinate units by means of personal visits and observation.
[00:41:08] It is essential that he know from personal contact the mental, moral and physical
[00:41:12] state of his troops, the conditions with which they are confronted, their accomplishments,
[00:41:17] their desires, their needs.
[00:41:20] I know your people.
[00:41:23] The commander should promptly extend recognition for services well done, lend help, where
[00:41:28] help is needed and give encouragement in adversity.
[00:41:33] Consider it to those whom he commands, he must be faithful and loyal to those who command
[00:41:38] him.
[00:41:40] A commander must live with his troops and share their dangers and privations as well as their
[00:41:45] joys and sorrows.
[00:41:47] By personal observation and experience, he will then be able to judge their needs and combat
[00:41:52] value, a commander who unnecessarily taxes the endurance of his troops will only penalize
[00:41:57] himself.
[00:41:59] The proper expenditure of combat strength in proportion to the objective to be attained.
[00:42:04] When necessary to the execution of the mission, the commander requires and receives from
[00:42:08] his unit the complete measure of sacrifice.
[00:42:14] We can sum all that up actually in by saying, and this is what we say with them, you
[00:42:18] got to build relationships.
[00:42:22] Not get back to the comment that was made earlier is when you violate these things, when
[00:42:27] you don't do these things for your men, your people, you certainly hurt them, but you
[00:42:31] actually are hurting yourself.
[00:42:33] You are actually going to be the loser in the end of all this because you're not doing
[00:42:38] things.
[00:42:39] Even that people should understand too is when they talk about all these different needs,
[00:42:44] everybody on your team is different too.
[00:42:46] This isn't just some blanket.
[00:42:47] I have a platoon of 25 or a company of 50.
[00:42:50] Every person's needs are going to be different and you as a leader actually need to know
[00:42:53] individually what all those are.
[00:42:56] Yes.
[00:42:57] And what I thought you were going to say, that's a great point.
[00:42:59] I thought you were going to say, when you said everybody, I said, oh, I know he's going
[00:43:03] this.
[00:43:04] When you're doing these little maneuvers to take care of yourself, everybody, you're
[00:43:09] not going to be able to do that.
[00:43:10] How do you notice this?
[00:43:11] And 100 percent.
[00:43:12] And not only that, not only do they see it, but they think that you think that they're
[00:43:17] stupid and you don't notice what's happening.
[00:43:21] And you look like the biggest idiot in the world.
[00:43:24] You make these little maneuvers, you have that little space heater.
[00:43:31] You have that little heater in your room whenever it's freezing.
[00:43:36] They know that.
[00:43:39] You set up your, you're in a logger site and it's raining and you go into the spot where
[00:43:46] you're under the protection of the whatever and all the sudden you're drying, everyone
[00:43:49] else is wet.
[00:43:50] And you think no one notices that.
[00:43:53] They notice it.
[00:43:54] One hundred percent.
[00:43:57] And they actually are looking at you thinking, oh, you think we don't see you.
[00:44:02] You take, you take not just one hit for being all warm and cozy, you take two hits
[00:44:10] for being warm and cozy and for letting everyone know that you think they're a bunch
[00:44:14] of idiots.
[00:44:15] You think you're smart, you're any idiot.
[00:44:18] Yeah.
[00:44:19] When you do that, everybody sees it.
[00:44:21] Everybody sees it.
[00:44:23] Everybody sees it.
[00:44:24] Oh, I was, we had to do security on, we would capture guys my first diploma to our
[00:44:30] equity would capture guys and then we had to, we held them in detention ourselves.
[00:44:36] We like had our own little detention facility and this is just the first example that I
[00:44:41] thought of.
[00:44:43] So we would have to stand watch, you know, which sucks, you know, it's whatever.
[00:44:48] And in my mind, the worst watch to take, I think it was like, this is a two hour watch
[00:44:53] and I thought two to four, right?
[00:44:55] Zero 200 is zero 400, that's where you got to wake up in the middle of the night, it takes
[00:45:01] you 20 minutes to get there, you're all, and then you get back and you get to sleep for
[00:45:06] another hour before you got to wake up.
[00:45:07] So the two to four is the worst, worst possible watch.
[00:45:10] And I remember telling my assistant, Patoon Kooander, like, hey, right on, we're taking
[00:45:14] zero two to zero four and he's like, really?
[00:45:16] And I'm like, yeah, and he's like, check, you knew exactly why.
[00:45:19] Because if I'm going to be asking everyone else to stay awake or get up early or whatever,
[00:45:23] we're taking the worst possible one, and, you know, you don't need to say anything about
[00:45:27] that.
[00:45:28] And no one says, hey, thanks.
[00:45:30] No one says that to you, but I'll tell you what, if you take the eight to ten watch,
[00:45:34] so you can go do your watch, wind down, go back and sleep like a normal human being,
[00:45:40] every single person, every single person will take note of that.
[00:45:46] And they'll log it down in their little, little, little mental log, but you're
[00:45:52] your leadership capabilities.
[00:45:55] So don't be an idiot.
[00:45:58] Everyone's watching.
[00:45:59] Yeah.
[00:46:00] And you can become that guy.
[00:46:01] Oh, if you do it enough, you'll become that guy.
[00:46:04] And then even when you figure it out, and you start to try to do the right thing, if you've
[00:46:09] been that guy for so long, they'll just write it like, oh, you're just trying to do the right.
[00:46:13] And you can't even dig out of that hole.
[00:46:15] You've got to be careful, you've got to stay out of that hole from the very begin.
[00:46:19] If you dig yourself in that hole, then you've got to start making real sacrifices.
[00:46:23] Take that.
[00:46:24] Take that.
[00:46:25] Listen, don't worry about watching.
[00:46:26] I got it all night tonight.
[00:46:27] I'm just going to suck it up.
[00:46:28] Okay.
[00:46:29] And you know, he's taking one for the team, right?
[00:46:31] And you're going to have to do that like 40 or exactly before you reach level.
[00:46:37] So yeah, if you think no one's noticing that, they're noticing next.
[00:46:41] A spirit of unselfish cooperation with their fellows is to be fostered among officers
[00:46:46] and men.
[00:46:47] So, it's a strong and incapable, must encourage and lead the week and less experienced.
[00:46:52] On such a foundation of feeling of true comradeship will become firmly established and
[00:46:57] the full combat value of the troops will be made available to the higher commander.
[00:47:04] Both of these, the troop and fearing and this, both talk about how the strong have to
[00:47:10] help the week.
[00:47:11] It's an interesting concept because it's very easy to get the attitude of like, hey,
[00:47:17] that guy's sucks.
[00:47:18] He's a non-hant.
[00:47:19] And I'm not going to help him.
[00:47:20] Yeah.
[00:47:21] It's really easy to take that attitude.
[00:47:23] And if you have that attitude, I remember to Officer Candidate's goal.
[00:47:28] There was some complaining to my drone instructor who was an outstanding, obviously, an outstanding
[00:47:35] Marine.
[00:47:36] So, you know, it was like, I think we got to write little notes to him, like little
[00:47:41] little comments, you know what I mean?
[00:47:43] And he got a comment that was like, you know, some of these people just shouldn't
[00:47:45] be here.
[00:47:46] And he came out and said, hey, let's say, you know what?
[00:47:49] I agree with you.
[00:47:50] We're going to get rid of the bottom 10%.
[00:47:53] And so, let's say, eight people like, yeah, and then he goes, and then you know, we're
[00:47:56] going to have a new bottom 10% and then a new bottom 10% and then a new bottom 10% and
[00:48:01] then the only person that's going to graduate from our Kenna School is Jacob.
[00:48:08] It's like, that's what that's what it turns out to, right?
[00:48:10] So what you have to do and what he was trying to say to us was, hey, what you need to
[00:48:15] do, your whole military career, you're going to have people that need help, you're freaking
[00:48:20] help them.
[00:48:21] Yeah, and also feeds this myth that you can just fire your way to success.
[00:48:25] I just get rid of these guys and we'd be so good to go if I could just get rid of
[00:48:28] these guys.
[00:48:29] I'm like, come on, and business who say it all the time.
[00:48:33] We ask people, hey, what are the people like in your company?
[00:48:35] And most people are hardworking and motivated and care in the tribe.
[00:48:38] So, what are those people need if they're struggling?
[00:48:40] They need help.
[00:48:41] That's what they need more than anything else.
[00:48:43] Does some people got to go?
[00:48:44] Yes, there are some people that got to go, but we're just going to cycle through 10% all
[00:48:48] the time.
[00:48:49] Come on, man.
[00:48:54] Back to the book, the combat value of a unit is determined and great measure by the soldier
[00:48:58] Lee qualities of its leaders and members and its will to fight.
[00:49:03] Outward marks of this combat value will be found in the setup and appearance of the men,
[00:49:08] in the condition care and maintenance of the weapons, and equipment, and in the readiness
[00:49:13] of the unit for action.
[00:49:16] Superior combat value will offset numerical inferiority.
[00:49:20] Superior leadership combined with some barrier combat value of troops constitutes a reliable
[00:49:26] basis for success in battle.
[00:49:29] Go, you were writing.
[00:49:31] I know you must have something important to say.
[00:49:33] Well, I was actually thinking about something that you would already said I was going to
[00:49:36] save her for later, but it occurred to me as you were talking about that previous comment
[00:49:39] about these are attributes we're talking about leaders in combat and war, and we're
[00:49:42] always making the connection to business and things like that.
[00:49:45] Here's the thing about that last comment about helping the weak.
[00:49:49] You can teach this at any age.
[00:49:53] Go read the warrior kid code.
[00:49:56] These are lessons that you're five, six, seven year old can start to learn now and to understand
[00:50:03] that the best thing you can do for the weak person in your class or the person struggling
[00:50:08] in your soccer team or these aren't adult lessons.
[00:50:12] If you're a leader out there and you got kids, you can start to instill this right now.
[00:50:17] That lesson is not just relevant for combat or for your platoon or even for your company.
[00:50:24] It's relevant for everybody at every age.
[00:50:26] If you teach it now, think about the success.
[00:50:28] Your kids will have in the long run you do that.
[00:50:31] Anyway, just make a connection.
[00:50:32] Yeah, so the warrior kid, let me see what number it is.
[00:50:45] The bottom line is, and this is where it gets a little bit of the warrior kid, number
[00:50:48] five.
[00:50:49] The warrior kid treats people with respect and helps out other people whenever possible.
[00:50:52] This is where everything is beautiful in the universe.
[00:50:56] Everything is beautiful in the universe because when you help other people, you get better.
[00:51:01] Your team gets better, but you get better.
[00:51:04] Every time you teach something, you get better at it.
[00:51:07] It's just the way it works.
[00:51:10] So there's like that mutual benefit.
[00:51:13] The idea that a ham is going to get rid of someone that's weak instead of helping them
[00:51:17] wrong.
[00:51:19] The warrior kid trains hard exercises and he needs to be strong and healthy and he knows
[00:51:24] how to fight so he can stand up to bullies and protect the weak.
[00:51:27] That's something for your kids right there.
[00:51:29] That is the same exact thing, they say you have to protect the weak and it helps you
[00:51:34] when you do that.
[00:51:36] Yeah.
[00:51:39] Continuing, a poorly trained unit is likely to fail in a critical moment due to demoralizing
[00:51:45] impressions caused by unexpected events in combat.
[00:51:49] This is particularly true in the first engagements of a unit.
[00:51:53] Therefore, training and discipline are of great importance.
[00:51:58] Reliever must take energetic action against the indescipline, panic, pillage and other disruptive
[00:52:05] forces.
[00:52:06] Discipline is the main cohesive force that binds the members of a unit.
[00:52:12] Discipline is the main cohesive force that binds.
[00:52:14] You know, it's interesting.
[00:52:16] I think we were covering SLA Marshall's men under fire and he's talking about when units
[00:52:21] got routed and when like mayhem broke, since people start running away.
[00:52:27] They have documented cases where the platoon leader up in the front line goes, hey, runner,
[00:52:34] go back and tell headquarters we need more ammunition.
[00:52:37] He goes, cool, got it, get something to start running.
[00:52:40] Someone sees him running and goes, oh, dang, we're running.
[00:52:44] So someone else gets up and then next thing you know, everyone is running.
[00:52:48] From one person just seeing it happen.
[00:52:51] And once again, that's what that's what we're talking with.
[00:52:54] Theo yesterday, the way you act as a leader, you got to act correctly.
[00:53:01] If you start to panic, if you start to freak out, if you start to lose your temper, if
[00:53:04] you start to lose your mind, everyone else is going to do the same thing.
[00:53:06] If you run away, everyone's going to do the same.
[00:53:07] If you go forward, everyone's going to follow you.
[00:53:12] And yes, discipline is the main cohesive force that binds the members of a unit together.
[00:53:18] A wise and capable commander will see that the men assigned to the competent groups and
[00:53:22] of his unit are compatible and that the composition of the groups is changed as little
[00:53:28] as possible.
[00:53:29] All right.
[00:53:32] So I'll read that one more time.
[00:53:34] A wise and capable commander will see that the men assigned to the competent groups of
[00:53:38] the unit are compatible.
[00:53:41] So they can interoperate, and they can change around.
[00:53:45] And that the compositions of his group groups is changed as little as possible.
[00:53:50] So when you have little subunits, keep them together.
[00:53:56] Keep them together.
[00:53:58] That's, they get to know each other, they get to understand each other, they can read
[00:54:02] out, read each other, and that's the way you need to work.
[00:54:06] They don't need to be freaking redevelop a relationship.
[00:54:09] They already have it.
[00:54:11] When task unit bruiser went through our urban training, and we had a bunch of strap hangers
[00:54:18] with us.
[00:54:19] We had a bunch of other people, EOD people, some other, we probably had an additional
[00:54:25] like 15 people with our task unit.
[00:54:29] And so the initial reaction from from life and Seth was, they put those guys, you know,
[00:54:38] that's two other squads.
[00:54:40] We don't want them in our cartoon.
[00:54:42] And I was like, no, what we're going to do is we're going to take one or two of them
[00:54:47] and put them in each one of our fire teams and make them part of our unit.
[00:54:52] And, you know, they objected.
[00:54:55] But what happens, what happens is that those people get individually, it's very easy for
[00:55:01] a four or five-man fire team to absorb a one or two people.
[00:55:04] Yeah.
[00:55:05] Hey, cool.
[00:55:06] What's your name?
[00:55:07] Fred, cool.
[00:55:08] Right on.
[00:55:09] You're good.
[00:55:10] Hey, I'm Bill.
[00:55:11] Let me know.
[00:55:12] Here's what I'm at.
[00:55:13] Here's how we do our head count.
[00:55:14] Here's what we're looking for.
[00:55:15] Boom.
[00:55:16] Integration was almost immediate.
[00:55:17] We have now when it was time to assault a building and we call them sections, because
[00:55:22] they weren't really fire teams.
[00:55:23] They were a little bit bigger now.
[00:55:24] So I called them sections and which is I stole from the grom, which is the Polish special
[00:55:29] operations that I worked to turn with my first diploma to Baghdad.
[00:55:31] They called the ad sections of like six guys.
[00:55:33] I was like, cool.
[00:55:34] We're going to have sections now because we were a little bit bigger than a fire team.
[00:55:37] Cool.
[00:55:38] And then it was like sections two, three and four assault section one, a whole fast and everyone
[00:55:44] knows what to do.
[00:55:46] You got little micro section leaders that are making things happen.
[00:55:49] Yeah.
[00:55:50] That doesn't happen.
[00:55:51] You take the six new guys and give them their own sex.
[00:55:53] Yeah.
[00:55:54] Yeah.
[00:55:55] Yeah.
[00:55:56] Yeah.
[00:55:57] No.
[00:55:58] And then you take, then you have three of those, right?
[00:55:58] Which is probably what we would have had three sections of people just randomly out
[00:56:04] there.
[00:56:05] By the way, and those people weren't even integrated as a unit.
[00:56:07] It wasn't like it was a separate platoon.
[00:56:09] If it was a full pl- another platoon of seals, that would have made some sense.
[00:56:12] Okay, cool.
[00:56:13] The platoon seals, they have their broken into fire.
[00:56:16] Yes.
[00:56:17] Okay, cool.
[00:56:18] We get it.
[00:56:19] We can command that.
[00:56:20] But we have 16, 15, 20 random people that haven't been working together.
[00:56:24] Cool.
[00:56:25] Guess what?
[00:56:26] You're about to report to a leader in task in a bruiser.
[00:56:28] This is petty officer's second class, get some.
[00:56:34] But that's what you wanted to do.
[00:56:35] You want to keep your team together.
[00:56:37] Continuing.
[00:56:38] He will provide each group with a leader in whom its members have confidence.
[00:56:42] That's another thing.
[00:56:43] So now you got the task being a bruiser guys.
[00:56:46] Everyone knows that fire team leader.
[00:56:47] They don't have to meet Fred.
[00:56:49] That guy who's at the jump team for eight years.
[00:56:52] He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:56:53] No, it doesn't matter.
[00:56:54] You know, Fred's on board with the program.
[00:56:55] He wants the win.
[00:56:58] He will so regulate the interior administration of the units that all groups perform
[00:57:03] the same amount of work and enjoy the same amount of leisure.
[00:57:06] He will see that demonstrated efficiency is promptly recognized and rewarded.
[00:57:10] You will set before all the high standard of military conduct and apply the same rules
[00:57:15] of discipline to all.
[00:57:17] Here's a good one.
[00:57:19] Good morale and a sense of unity in a command cannot be improvised.
[00:57:25] They must be thoroughly planned and systematically promoted.
[00:57:29] They are born of just in fair treatment, a constant concern for the soldiers welfare.
[00:57:34] Oh, you want to build morale?
[00:57:36] There you go.
[00:57:37] A constant concern for the soldiers welfare.
[00:57:40] They are all training in basic duties, comrade ship among men and pride in self, organization
[00:57:45] and country.
[00:57:48] Morales a byproduct of your leadership.
[00:57:51] Good leaders have units with good morale.
[00:57:53] Bad leaders don't.
[00:57:55] Period.
[00:57:56] Yeah.
[00:57:57] The Marine Corps does a damn good job of this one, don't they?
[00:58:00] I mean, I mean, the military doesn't general about damn the Marine Corps.
[00:58:04] Good at that.
[00:58:05] Because when you're in the Marine Corps, you're in the Marine Corps.
[00:58:09] That's just the way it is.
[00:58:13] The establishment and maintenance of good morale are incumbent upon every commander and
[00:58:20] are the marks of good leadership, which is what you just said.
[00:58:25] And then we get to number 111.
[00:58:29] The first demand in war is decisive action.
[00:58:35] Commanders inspire confidence in their subordinates by their decisive conduct and their ability
[00:58:39] to gain material advantage over the enemy.
[00:58:41] A reputation for failure in a leader destroys morale.
[00:58:46] The morale of a unit is that of its leader.
[00:58:52] Again, that's what you just said.
[00:58:55] But hey, the first demand in war is decisive action.
[00:58:58] And again, it talks about the southern metropolitan.
[00:59:01] An age of all gave a great example.
[00:59:04] You know, decisive action doesn't mean you just make the full commitment to a decision
[00:59:08] and he gave that example of looking at your Google Maps.
[00:59:12] You've got to walk through the city to a place and it's two miles away.
[00:59:18] And so you walk out of the hotel and you look at your Google Maps and the arrow is just spinning.
[00:59:24] Because you're not going anywhere.
[00:59:25] Cool.
[00:59:26] Start walking.
[00:59:27] Take 10 steps.
[00:59:28] That thing will self-correct because now you'll know where you're supposed to be going.
[00:59:31] So that's a decisive action.
[00:59:33] Sitting there, not doing anything, isn't getting you anywhere.
[00:59:37] That the enemy's maneuvering on you, by the way.
[00:59:39] Yeah.
[00:59:40] And that flip side you talked about is, hey, we want to get into this space.
[00:59:43] Well, that's by three buildings.
[00:59:44] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:59:45] Hang on.
[00:59:46] We actually, that is overly, that's way overly aggressive.
[00:59:49] And actually, isn't what you need.
[00:59:51] Yeah, that example was awesome.
[00:59:55] A commander must bear in mind that physical unfitness will undermine his efficiency.
[01:00:02] And actually, surprisingly, I don't think this is in the trooping
[01:00:06] fury at all.
[01:00:07] I don't think they talk about physical fitness in this much clarity.
[01:00:11] A commander must bear in mind that physical unfitness will undermine his efficiency.
[01:00:16] He owes it to the men under his command to conserve his own fitness.
[01:00:23] neglect renders him, unable to bring a normal mind to the solution of his problems
[01:00:29] and reacts unfavorable on his whole command.
[01:00:34] That is, that is a heavy statement.
[01:00:36] Here's the thing that, you know, that term fatigue will make a coward out of any
[01:00:44] man.
[01:00:45] Like when you get tired, it's, you start making bad decisions and you can't maintain.
[01:00:53] So that's what this is.
[01:00:55] And if you're the better physical condition you're in, the more you'll be able to
[01:01:02] maintain for.
[01:01:03] You know, people freak out because I don't sleep a lot, which I, I'm not, I don't encourage
[01:01:07] people not to sleep a lot.
[01:01:09] You should sleep as much sleep as you need.
[01:01:10] Get it, bunch of sleep.
[01:01:11] It's great.
[01:01:12] I know the sleep diplomat guy sleep.
[01:01:14] I'm not against that sleep.
[01:01:16] But what I, I will say is this, like if you're in good physical condition and you eat well,
[01:01:23] you will not need as much sleep.
[01:01:25] I'm here to tell you, like, well, at least I don't think you do.
[01:01:29] I was talking about with with with with Flynn Cochran the other day on being on the road
[01:01:34] all the time.
[01:01:35] And so sometimes we're on the road.
[01:01:37] I flew literally to Maine 36 hours ago and I flew back the very next day.
[01:01:41] I was on the road and and the the best thing you can do in the situation where you're going
[01:01:47] to be tired is actually go workout for sure.
[01:01:49] I mean, it's the best thing you can do.
[01:01:51] And the days that I get them like, I have to work out at 330 and I don't, I regret
[01:01:55] at the entire day.
[01:01:56] Yeah.
[01:01:57] I never once heard you say you don't need sleep, but what the reality is is is when
[01:02:03] you're tired, the best thing you can do is get out of bed and do something physical.
[01:02:09] Yeah.
[01:02:10] Is the best way to without a doubt.
[01:02:12] Yeah.
[01:02:13] And yeah, it's physical fitness.
[01:02:16] Don't neglect it.
[01:02:17] And that that happens a lot of times in business.
[01:02:19] People get wrapped in the business.
[01:02:21] And if you don't make some time to stay physically fit, strategic look, there's going to be
[01:02:26] times in business.
[01:02:27] There's times in echelon front.
[01:02:27] There's times in our lives where, hey man, you like, I don't, I can't do my normal workouts
[01:02:33] during the master.
[01:02:35] Like we do, we do, we work out.
[01:02:37] But it's not, it's not my normal workout.
[01:02:39] It's a workout that takes 40 minutes, not and it's only one a day.
[01:02:43] You know, so that's not normal.
[01:02:44] But we get to suck it up for the master.
[01:02:46] It's, you know, four or five days of us very, very work intensive.
[01:02:54] But when that's over, man, you've got to get right back into it.
[01:02:57] So people that go, hey, I get it.
[01:03:00] You've got some project to do and you've got a week where you can only work out for 10 minutes
[01:03:04] a day, eight minutes a day, 28 minutes a day, whatever.
[01:03:08] Cool.
[01:03:09] Get it.
[01:03:10] I get it.
[01:03:11] If you don't work out and then all of a sudden you can develop that habit, well, then you
[01:03:16] have to bear in mind that the physical unfitness is going to undermine your efficiency period
[01:03:21] in the story.
[01:03:22] So that's the closest out leadership.
[01:03:29] The next chapter is called the exercise of command.
[01:03:34] Doctrins of combat chapter four.
[01:03:38] Here's where we give credit good writing, solid statement.
[01:03:42] The ultimate objective of all military operations is the destruction of the enemies armed
[01:03:46] forces in battle.
[01:03:49] That's those simple statements like that.
[01:03:52] It's interesting when we go work with companies and no one, everyone is completely lost
[01:03:56] track of what it is that they're trying to do.
[01:03:58] Yeah.
[01:03:59] What's your mission?
[01:04:00] Yep.
[01:04:01] The ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most decisively and quickly
[01:04:08] to the defeat of the hostile armed forces is one attribute of the able commander.
[01:04:14] What does that mean?
[01:04:15] A good leader has the ability to prioritize and execute the most important things already
[01:04:20] to begin.
[01:04:21] The ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most decisively and quickly
[01:04:27] to defeat the hostile armed forces is one attribute of the able commander.
[01:04:32] That is prioritized next.
[01:04:34] You got to pick the most important thing.
[01:04:35] What are they calling here?
[01:04:37] The objective, whose attainment contributes most decisively.
[01:04:43] That's the most important thing.
[01:04:44] That's what you're going to focus on.
[01:04:46] Prioritize an execute.
[01:04:47] Next, simple and direct plans and methods with prompt and thorough executioner often
[01:04:54] decisive in the attainment of success.
[01:04:56] That is almost verbatim from group and fear of it.
[01:05:00] Almost the exact same thing.
[01:05:02] You got to keep things simple.
[01:05:05] People been saying that forever.
[01:05:09] Unity of command obtains that unity of effort, which is essential to the decisive
[01:05:15] application of full combat power of the available forces.
[01:05:18] Unity of effort is furthered by full cooperation between elements of the command.
[01:05:25] Yes, prioritize an execute.
[01:05:27] Figure out what's most important and then cover and move for each other as you execute.
[01:05:33] Ext through offensive action, a commander exercises his initiative, preserves his freedom
[01:05:41] of action and imposes his will on the enemy.
[01:05:46] Boom, there you go.
[01:05:48] What is that offensive action?
[01:05:51] Being on the offense, not being on the defense.
[01:05:54] Think of what it does for you as a person, as a human, as a leader.
[01:05:58] It exercises your initiative, preserves your freedom of action and imposes your will on the
[01:06:03] enemy.
[01:06:05] You got to go on offense.
[01:06:08] A defensive attitude may, however, be deliberately adopted as a temporary expedient while
[01:06:14] awaiting an opportunity for counter offensive action.
[01:06:17] Hey, look, sometimes you got to be defensive or made a budget better be looking for that
[01:06:21] moment to go back on the offense.
[01:06:23] The defensive posture is designed to find the opportunity to go on the defensive.
[01:06:29] Go on the offensive.
[01:06:30] That's why you're doing it.
[01:06:32] If you're on the defense, this is so clear in Gitu.
[01:06:34] If you're on defense in Gitu and you stay on defense, you will lose.
[01:06:39] Eventually you're going to get caught.
[01:06:40] You can only defend so much and they're attacking.
[01:06:42] They have the initiative.
[01:06:43] They have the freedom of action.
[01:06:45] They're imposing their will on you.
[01:06:46] You can defend for a little while, but eventually you're going to get taken.
[01:06:49] You're going to get submitted.
[01:06:50] It's same in flying.
[01:06:51] And there is a comment in there that I think it's the describe the freedom of movement.
[01:06:56] It's a thing we talk about all the time as the attribute to make sure that you're doing
[01:06:59] it correctly is, can you still maneuver?
[01:07:01] So you can't be so offensive that you no longer can maneuver.
[01:07:04] But the ability to maneuver in that position is what allows you to find the opportunity
[01:07:08] to exploit and then go on the offensive to preserve your maneuvering room is the part that
[01:07:15] you're balanced in those.
[01:07:16] So how do you over commit an aircraft?
[01:07:18] Actually, it's easy and it happens all the time and you have the aircraft have potential
[01:07:23] energy or capability and if you're maneuver to get closer or whatever you're trying
[01:07:28] to do with another aircraft, if you overdo that and then at your next move you don't have
[01:07:32] any energy to turn the aircraft.
[01:07:34] You're going to lose.
[01:07:35] And that can happen in the most powerful airplane in the world.
[01:07:38] I could be an arraptor and if I turn it really hard and actually turn it too hard and my
[01:07:41] energy goes from three inch and knots to 100 knots.
[01:07:44] I haven't allowed myself to kill them at that move so I need another move on the chessboard
[01:07:50] and there's no energy left.
[01:07:51] I literally can't maneuver and I will lose to an inferior platform.
[01:07:55] So when you're riding a bicycle, if you're going slow, it's harder to stay balanced
[01:08:01] and it's harder to turn.
[01:08:02] Is that the same thing like when you're in an aircraft, you do certain amount of speed?
[01:08:08] There's a point at which and it's measured.
[01:08:11] You know what that point is, is where your maneuvering gets to a peak and then starts to diminish
[01:08:15] and then you can no longer maneuver based on that speed.
[01:08:17] And that's speed.
[01:08:18] That's solely based on speed.
[01:08:20] It's exactly right.
[01:08:21] Or it would call potential energy.
[01:08:23] You might need altitude.
[01:08:24] You would descend to get that energy back.
[01:08:26] But it's a combination of the actual air speed, the number in your display, 100 miles in
[01:08:30] our arraptor, whatever it is and how much altitude that you have.
[01:08:33] And the ground is the ground and so if you cannot descend, whatever your air speed is,
[01:08:37] that's what you have left.
[01:08:39] It's, we call it potential energy, but it boils down to how much maneuvering air speed do
[01:08:43] you have.
[01:08:44] How fast is a raptor have to be going?
[01:08:48] So it doesn't stall.
[01:08:49] Well that number happens to be extremely low and the irony in that is a lot of people
[01:08:53] don't understand is that your minimum controllable air speed is a critical component.
[01:08:58] So the slow r I can go and be maneuverable is a huge advantage for me.
[01:09:03] But every aircraft has a limit that if you get past whatever that number is, you're out
[01:09:07] of maneuvering air speed and you're going to lose.
[01:09:09] You have to have the ability to maneuver no matter what situation you're in to include being
[01:09:13] on the defensive.
[01:09:14] And that's what they're talking about is I'm going to stay in this position until I see
[01:09:17] the opportunity to go the offensive and I'm going to maneuver in that position.
[01:09:20] What was that standard move that you do when you don't know what to do?
[01:09:23] Lift vector on and pull.
[01:09:25] Point of the guy and turn until you figure out what you need to do next.
[01:09:29] Lift vector.
[01:09:30] Vector.
[01:09:31] To essentially where your airplane is going in this guy.
[01:09:33] And if you don't know what to do, you put your lift vector directly on your opponent.
[01:09:36] You point directly at him and you start to maneuver towards directly towards him.
[01:09:41] That doesn't mean it's the right move.
[01:09:44] It means because you don't know what the right move is, you have to be doing something.
[01:09:48] Because if you sit there and do nothing, which is sort of the ultimate defensive position
[01:09:52] is I'm just going to hole up and bury, you're going to die so quickly.
[01:09:58] Go on the offense.
[01:09:59] Go on the offense.
[01:10:00] Even if you're not 100% sure what to do, go on the offense.
[01:10:04] If a defensive posture is actually a decision you make by design.
[01:10:09] Going on the offensive, if you don't know what to do, if it's only your maneuvering,
[01:10:13] the more training the more reps you have, the sooner you're going to figure out what to do.
[01:10:16] The default aggressive mindset of going on the offensive, what doesn't that apply?
[01:10:22] Yeah, I mean, and this is something that Andrew and I talked about.
[01:10:27] You obviously, you don't just commit.
[01:10:30] And once you, what you just said, you just don't commit ignorantly.
[01:10:33] No, and you don't over commit.
[01:10:35] You make the small decisions, even lift vector on and pull.
[01:10:40] Even that, that's like an adjustment, but then you're immediately, you're just under the
[01:10:44] you to loop.
[01:10:45] That's your 10 steps down the road to get orient to that Andrew just described.
[01:10:50] And as soon as you, okay, I've got it figured out now you go do something else.
[01:10:54] You've got to keep that maneuvering speed.
[01:10:57] Continue on, the selection by the commander of the right time in place for offensive action
[01:11:01] is a decisive factor in the success of the operation.
[01:11:06] New miracle inferiority does not necessarily commit a command to a defensive attitude.
[01:11:11] Superior hostile numbers may be overcome through greater mobility, better armament, and
[01:11:17] equipment, more effective fire, higher morale, and better leadership.
[01:11:24] Superior leadership often enables a numerically inferior force to be stronger at the point
[01:11:29] of decisive action.
[01:11:33] Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
[01:11:35] So legit.
[01:11:37] Mobility.
[01:11:39] Arm better armament and equipment, more effective fire, higher morale.
[01:11:44] Isn't it interesting?
[01:11:45] Everyone would think better armament, right?
[01:11:48] Everyone would think better equipment.
[01:11:50] Most people would think better, effective fire, but higher morale.
[01:11:54] Just having higher morale is an element in achieving victory even if you're an
[01:11:58] a numerically inferior position.
[01:12:02] A strategically defensive mission is frequently most effectively executed through offensive
[01:12:07] action.
[01:12:08] It is often necessary for an inferior force to strike at an early moment in order to secure
[01:12:14] initial advantages or to prevent itself from being overwhelmed by a growing superior
[01:12:19] or the enhanced forces.
[01:12:23] If you run a company and you're the smaller company that you're competing with your
[01:12:27] competitors, being defensive is going to get you killed.
[01:12:30] You're going to get run over by this bigger company because they're going to use the
[01:12:33] resources and size to bulldoze you.
[01:12:36] You have to be poised to strike, go on the offensive.
[01:12:38] The first opportunity you can.
[01:12:39] That is the right opportunity to do that.
[01:12:42] It's interesting in jujitsu.
[01:12:44] The same thing happens.
[01:12:47] One of the best things to do if you're on the defensive is attack something and then
[01:12:53] all of a sudden you can turn the tables really really quick if you're lucky.
[01:12:59] Concentration of superior forces both on the ground and in the air at the decisive place
[01:13:03] in time and their employment in a decisive direction creates conditions essential to victory.
[01:13:10] So again this is prioritizing actually what are you doing?
[01:13:13] You're concentrating.
[01:13:14] The resources, your people, your manpower, you're concentrating everything at the right
[01:13:20] time.
[01:13:21] Such concentration requires strict economy and the strength of forces assigned to secondary
[01:13:26] missions.
[01:13:27] What does that mean?
[01:13:28] If you focus on other things, if you don't prioritize next to you, you're going to fall
[01:13:32] apart.
[01:13:33] Detachments during combat are justifiable only when the execution of tasks assigns them
[01:13:40] contributes directly to success in the main battle.
[01:13:44] So I got a little note there, never split forces.
[01:13:47] I loved it when tilt was on and tilt was talking about he's like yeah, so I had one group
[01:13:52] in the valley and one group in the tree line or something like that and I was kind of like
[01:13:56] I was all bummed out and I was all nervous and I was all sad because I always preached
[01:14:01] don't split forces and I was like man I never really liked to split forces.
[01:14:07] He goes I only did it two times.
[01:14:09] It's like yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, because when you, well, there's all kinds
[01:14:15] of confusion that happened there but then this isn't really talking about not splitting
[01:14:19] forces about this is talking about is if you start peeling people off to do other things,
[01:14:22] it better really still contribute to the main effort.
[01:14:26] Yep.
[01:14:28] Surprise must be sought throughout the action by every means and by every echelonic command.
[01:14:34] It may be obtained by fire as well as by movement.
[01:14:38] Otherwise it's produced through measures which either deny information to the enemy or
[01:14:42] positively deceive him as to our dispositions of movements and plants terrain which appears
[01:14:47] to impose great difficulties on operations may often be utilized against surprise.
[01:14:52] Surprise is furthered by variation in the means and methods employed in combat and by
[01:14:56] rapidity of execution.
[01:14:59] When Brian Stan was on he was like he loved to talk about that operational tempo and that's
[01:15:07] what this is talking about in that last sentence.
[01:15:08] How quickly can you execute?
[01:15:11] If you can turn quickly and you can get back out there that's going to surprise the enemy.
[01:15:16] Going into Ramadi in boats that was a terrain that the enemy didn't expect the boys
[01:15:22] to come in like that's what's going to happen.
[01:15:25] There was other times where guys went on long patrols.
[01:15:28] The enemy didn't think we're going to be out there.
[01:15:32] Surprise finds the enemy in a state of mental, moral or physical unpreparedness.
[01:15:37] Every effort should be made to deny him to take effective countermeasures.
[01:15:41] The effect of surprise may be lost through solitary methods of execution.
[01:15:48] To guard against surprise requires a correct estimate of enemy capabilities, adequate security
[01:15:54] measures effective reconnaissance and readiness for action of all units.
[01:15:58] Every unit takes the necessary measures for its own local ground and air security, provision
[01:16:02] for the security of flanks and rear is of special importance.
[01:16:10] It also requires humility to recognize that you don't necessarily know exactly what your
[01:16:16] enemy is going to do and might want to think that they are more capable than you think
[01:16:20] they might be and you have to have the noted recognize.
[01:16:22] They might do something that we might anticipate and a humble leader doesn't get complacent
[01:16:28] what the enemy can and will do.
[01:16:30] They'll never do that.
[01:16:31] They'll never do that.
[01:16:32] They'll never do that.
[01:16:33] That's exactly what they're going to do if you're not.
[01:16:36] Absolutely.
[01:16:37] Command is the authority.
[01:16:38] This section is called Command.
[01:16:39] Command is the authority which an individual in the military service lawfully exercises
[01:16:43] over-sabordinates by virtue of rank or assignment.
[01:16:49] That's what Command is.
[01:16:50] By I lawfully outrank you and therefore you have to obey me.
[01:16:59] That is, as this, Command and leadership are inseparable.
[01:17:03] Whether the forces larger small, whether the functions of Command are complex or simple,
[01:17:08] the Commander must be the controlling head.
[01:17:11] His must be the mastermind and from him must flow the energy and impulse which are to
[01:17:17] animate all under him.
[01:17:22] So that's a little bit interesting.
[01:17:28] Then we get into this.
[01:17:31] That's when I was talking earlier about how there's always that difference between people
[01:17:39] that think, hey, good leadership means these people will just listen to me because I have
[01:17:45] authority over them.
[01:17:47] And there's people that realize the truth which is that's not the way you want to lead at
[01:17:52] all, which we will get into here.
[01:17:58] Decision as to specific course of action is responsibility of the Commander alone.
[01:18:03] While he may accept advice and suggestions from any of his subordinates, he alone is responsible
[01:18:07] for what the unit does or fails to do.
[01:18:08] And I think that was really the crux of what that last statement was trying to say is like,
[01:18:15] listen, you're going to have a platoon chief, a platoon sergeant, whatever, a company first
[01:18:21] sergeant, a chief operating officer or chief operations officer that's going to give you
[01:18:28] advice.
[01:18:29] It's going to help you make decisions, but if you're the boss, it's on you.
[01:18:34] And at the end, the idea that the leader, the Commander is responsible for the outcome
[01:18:39] no matter what, I think what they're getting at.
[01:18:41] I mean, I hear that in their words that I don't like the exact other way that they say it,
[01:18:46] but I'm glad that they're making that clear distinction that Commander leadership are
[01:18:49] two different things.
[01:18:50] Commander's the structure.
[01:18:51] And we all understand that military, I know who my boss is, the org-chargenetic company defines
[01:18:56] the CEO, the CEO, the frontline supervisor, but the leadership component, a good commander,
[01:19:02] not only am I going to take advice from other people, there are times that I simply won't
[01:19:07] be where they are.
[01:19:08] And I need them to make those decisions and lead their team to end up being wrong, it's
[01:19:13] still my responsibility.
[01:19:16] And that piece of it, I think, is 100% sure.
[01:19:18] Yeah.
[01:19:19] Yeah, it's, we'll dig into it a little bit more here in a second.
[01:19:24] This continues on, which is this is getting into exactly what you were just saying, a willingness
[01:19:31] to accept responsibility is the foremost trait of leadership.
[01:19:36] So we wrote an entire book about that called Extreme Ownership.
[01:19:41] And willingness to accept responsibility is the foremost trait of leadership.
[01:19:46] Every individual from the highest commander to the lowest private must always remember that
[01:19:50] inaction and neglect of opportunities will warrant even more severe censure than an error
[01:19:57] of judgment in the action taken.
[01:19:59] So this is something that, through inferior, definitely, hit on almost word for word.
[01:20:05] That's worse to not do anything than it is to make a call and try and execute.
[01:20:13] And you have bad judgment.
[01:20:15] So those are bold statements.
[01:20:21] Continue on the criterion by which a commander judges the soundness of his own decision
[01:20:25] is whether it will further the intentions of the higher commander.
[01:20:28] So there you go.
[01:20:29] That makes it really easy to make decisions out of the battlefield.
[01:20:31] If you come back to me and say, hey, jockel, this is what I did.
[01:20:36] I know that we were trying to push west and I had an opportunity to get on this null.
[01:20:41] I know it was outside our limit of advance, but it gave me a really good feel the fire over
[01:20:46] the west.
[01:20:47] That's why I went there and I'm like, you know what?
[01:20:51] Ended up not working out the way we wanted it to, but I'm glad that you did it.
[01:20:55] Okay?
[01:20:56] Because at least you went for it.
[01:20:57] As opposed to, well, you know, I know we were going west, but I decided, you know, maybe
[01:21:02] it would be smarter for us to go east.
[01:21:03] And that's why I backed my force off, right?
[01:21:05] You can't just ignore the overall commander.
[01:21:11] The overall commander in the higher position.
[01:21:13] You've got to support his intentions.
[01:21:15] So as long and what that means is for the higher commander, you've got to make sure that
[01:21:18] your intentions are known.
[01:21:19] That's why we have commanders intent.
[01:21:20] Totally.
[01:21:23] As to accept responsibility must not manifest itself in a disregard of orders on the basis
[01:21:29] of a mere probability of having better knowledge of the situation in the higher commander.
[01:21:34] The subordinate unit is a part of a tactical team employed by the higher commander to accomplish
[01:21:39] a certain mission and any independence on the part of the subordinate commander must conform
[01:21:44] to the general plan for the unit as a whole.
[01:21:46] So that's why we have parameters.
[01:21:48] That's what decentralized command.
[01:21:50] That's why when I'm always going off about, hey, for decentralized command to work, you
[01:21:53] have to make sure everyone understands what the mission is, what the goal is, what the
[01:21:55] end state is, what the parameters are that people allow to work with it.
[01:21:58] That's what you need to do.
[01:21:59] And that's what they're talking about here.
[01:22:04] Continuing, the commander's mission is contained in the orders which he has received.
[01:22:07] Nevertheless, a commander of a subordinate unit cannot plead absence of orders or the non-receive
[01:22:13] orders as an excuse for inactivity in a situation where action is where action on part
[01:22:18] on his part is essential.
[01:22:20] Or where a change in the situation upon which the issued orders were based, renders such
[01:22:25] orders impractical or impossible of execution.
[01:22:28] So lack of orders lead in absence of orders lead.
[01:22:33] I didn't know, nobody told me what to do.
[01:22:38] And that same responsibility for the leader of recognizing that he has to train his people
[01:22:43] to be able to lead in the absence of orders is 100% going to happen all the time in those
[01:22:48] situations.
[01:22:49] And this is so scary, especially from a military perspective.
[01:22:53] It's really scary because if this sounds like could easily just just devolve into total
[01:23:01] mayhem, right?
[01:23:02] Hey, look, just because you don't have orders doesn't mean you should sit around and
[01:23:05] do nothing.
[01:23:06] And people, there's some people who think, well, I don't want my damn for some, you
[01:23:10] know, corporal, fire team leader out there, making calls.
[01:23:14] Yes, you do.
[01:23:15] You have to.
[01:23:16] As long as he understands from you what the intent is, then he's cleared hot.
[01:23:21] Yeah.
[01:23:22] And you'll figure out the right thing to do.
[01:23:24] I had 13 guys in my Anglical team in her body.
[01:23:27] 13.
[01:23:28] And I always think, man, this is 13 guys.
[01:23:30] This is a small group.
[01:23:31] This is easy.
[01:23:32] And when I got there immediately, immediately, I think the second day I'm there and like,
[01:23:37] man, I got to split these teams up.
[01:23:38] There's just too many missions, too much to do.
[01:23:40] I simply can't do this.
[01:23:41] So 13 people I got to do four here or four here.
[01:23:44] And I split them up, nine, maybe 10 of the 13 guys were on their very first deployment.
[01:23:50] And look, I'll be honest with you.
[01:23:52] The first time I watched another gun truck go off the base without me and like, man, I
[01:23:56] don't like this.
[01:23:57] I didn't like that.
[01:24:00] But not only was it necessary.
[01:24:02] Obviously, he was completely necessary because the the optempo in her body was just
[01:24:06] completely out of control.
[01:24:07] I could have used 30 more people if I had him.
[01:24:10] But the reality is is that if you train them and they actually understand what they're
[01:24:15] there to get accomplished, they can go lead without you being there and you need them to.
[01:24:20] And they have to go do it.
[01:24:21] And yeah, as a leader, it's it is a little hard to let them go decentralized command.
[01:24:25] The ultimate culmination of these laws, which is what you want.
[01:24:28] It is a little scary and it's a little hard.
[01:24:31] But you can't, there's no other alternative.
[01:24:33] What it should, what that fear should do, that fear should compel you to make sure that
[01:24:38] everyone understands what the commanders intend is, make sure to understand what the parameters
[01:24:42] are.
[01:24:43] Yes.
[01:24:44] Make sure they understand the rules of engagement.
[01:24:45] Make sure they understand everything that's in your head.
[01:24:47] That's what it should compel you to do because it is scary.
[01:24:49] Yeah.
[01:24:50] And that you've done all the other things required to get to that.
[01:24:53] I have incredibly strong relationships.
[01:24:55] They understand every single thing I need them to understand.
[01:24:59] And they know that we have to make hard decisions on the battlefield and prioritize.
[01:25:03] They're going to do the ones that greatly, the most impact on the emission of the
[01:25:06] General College, I actually have to follow the laws of combat if I want to get the decentralized
[01:25:10] command.
[01:25:11] Sure.
[01:25:12] Continuing on, if the situation does not permit communication with the superior commander
[01:25:16] and the subordinate commander is familiar with the general plan of operations or the mission
[01:25:20] of the whole command, he should take appropriate action and report situation as early as
[01:25:24] practical.
[01:25:26] Which is what exactly what your guys did and what you did with them.
[01:25:29] The situations that confront a commander and war are of infinite variety.
[01:25:34] And despite of the most careful planning and anticipation, unexpected obstacles, frictions
[01:25:38] and mistakes are common occurrences in battle.
[01:25:42] So that's right, things are going to go wrong.
[01:25:44] A commander must school himself to regard these events as commonplace and not permit them
[01:25:49] to frustrate him in the accomplishment of the mission.
[01:25:52] Yeah.
[01:25:53] What spins me up?
[01:25:55] Nothing.
[01:25:56] Nothing.
[01:25:57] Everyone's going to screw up.
[01:25:58] I'm going to screw up.
[01:25:59] You're going to screw up.
[01:26:00] The team leaders are going to screw up.
[01:26:01] The two and start.
[01:26:02] It's going to screw up.
[01:26:03] That's what's going to happen.
[01:26:04] I know he's going to do unexpected things.
[01:26:06] That's what's going to happen.
[01:26:08] Guess what's going to happen in your life?
[01:26:10] Things are going to go wrong.
[01:26:12] The deal is not going to get closed.
[01:26:15] The kids are going to get sick.
[01:26:17] The cars are going to crap.
[01:26:18] These things are going to happen.
[01:26:19] They're going to happen.
[01:26:21] It's the way life is.
[01:26:23] No one's rolling through life.
[01:26:25] Not hitting speed bumps.
[01:26:27] It's not happening.
[01:26:28] Don't let them throw you off.
[01:26:33] Now here we go.
[01:26:36] Personal conferences between the higher commander and his subordinates who are to execute
[01:26:41] his orders may at times be advisable that the latter may arrive at a correct understanding
[01:26:47] of the plans and intentions of their superior.
[01:26:52] They continue his own.
[01:26:55] Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates.
[01:26:58] Where do they seek the approve love subordinates for their actions?
[01:27:04] Now when I read that, like the other one that we were both kind of like, yes, I'm not
[01:27:09] sure.
[01:27:10] When I read that right there, I was like, here's my notes.
[01:27:13] You see what they say?
[01:27:14] It says wrong.
[01:27:15] That's wrong.
[01:27:16] That's just wrong.
[01:27:17] I'll read it again.
[01:27:18] So we know what's wrong.
[01:27:19] It starts off with something cool.
[01:27:20] Hey, personal conferences between the higher commander and his subordinates who are to execute
[01:27:24] his orders may at times be advisable.
[01:27:27] You go on a meet with your people so that the latter may arrive at the correct understanding
[01:27:31] of the plans and intentions of their superior.
[01:27:32] Yes, meet with your people to almost going on.
[01:27:35] But then it says this, I kind of have to change voices for this one a little bit.
[01:27:40] Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates.
[01:27:44] No, do they seek the approval of their subordinates for their actions?
[01:27:48] So I highlighted that circle and I wrote wrong.
[01:27:51] I was really pissed when I read it.
[01:27:53] And I was like, you know what?
[01:27:56] Let's see if anything changed.
[01:27:58] So I went to the 1944 manual and in 1944, that there are very limited changes in this
[01:28:10] section.
[01:28:11] In fact, mostly what is different between 1944 and 1941 is they have a massive sections
[01:28:20] on air power on how it's going to be used.
[01:28:22] So I started all that stuff in the 1944 version.
[01:28:27] They completely eliminate that sentence.
[01:28:30] Yeah, good.
[01:28:33] They completely eliminate that sentence because guess what?
[01:28:36] As a commander, you are absolutely trying to explain your decisions to your subordinates.
[01:28:42] You want them to understand why you're making a decision.
[01:28:46] You want them to never mind to prove you want them to actually just totally embrace
[01:28:50] and love and probably hopefully even come up with that decision themselves.
[01:28:54] There's probably some element in there of this idea of decisiveness.
[01:28:59] And the language is probably trying to get to something that they were thinking about
[01:29:03] that was clearly not explained correctly.
[01:29:06] But this idea that you don't owe your people and explanation is crazy.
[01:29:12] It's crazy.
[01:29:13] And as a matter of fact, if you can't explain it in a way that's really compelling and
[01:29:19] they have them go, oh boss, got it.
[01:29:20] I'm on board.
[01:29:22] You're doing it wrong.
[01:29:23] You actually don't understand it well enough.
[01:29:24] And if you have to leverage the, oh you don't understand what I'm saying.
[01:29:27] Okay, just do your job because I'm in charge of you.
[01:29:30] It's just wrong.
[01:29:31] Yeah, period.
[01:29:32] And it's like this stood out for me.
[01:29:35] This is not in the German manual at all.
[01:29:38] It's not in there.
[01:29:39] There's nothing that says anything close to that in German manual.
[01:29:41] So what that told me is, that's why I started thinking about this pull between people
[01:29:46] that leaders that are like, hey listen, bottom line, there's people got a dude to tell
[01:29:49] me dude.
[01:29:50] That's what there was a guy in the room.
[01:29:52] I wonder if there's that guy there.
[01:29:54] So hey, this is 41 now, I think, you know, little piece of, you know, hey, there's
[01:29:58] this piece of this, this time that they didn't really quite get it.
[01:30:03] The 44 guys are thinking, well, what have we been doing for the last three years?
[01:30:07] Get rid of that because that's crap.
[01:30:08] It doesn't work.
[01:30:09] Exactly.
[01:30:10] This room in this room, there was some pug, some rear echelon dude that was sitting
[01:30:18] there going, hey, you know, the bottom line though, I understand that we want, you know,
[01:30:21] people got to understand.
[01:30:22] But the bottom line is you don't have to go and justify your decisions to your subordinates.
[01:30:26] You know, that you don't need to seek approval.
[01:30:28] Yeah.
[01:30:29] You tell them what to do and they go and damn do it.
[01:30:31] That's the way it's got to be in the end, you're in charge.
[01:30:34] So if they can't, you know, go back and forth for a while, but sooner than you got
[01:30:36] to put your foot down and let them do those in charge.
[01:30:39] You got to just got to let them have it.
[01:30:41] And like you said, you can you imagine they reconvene after three years of war.
[01:30:47] And they say, you know what?
[01:30:50] Who wrote, who's the pug that wrote that?
[01:30:52] We're not going to rewrite it or change it.
[01:30:54] You can't just rid of it.
[01:30:55] And that sentence.
[01:30:58] I wasn't sure if I wanted to, we were actually going to cover this manual, but when I
[01:31:01] got to that, I was like, oh, this is all, this makes it all worthwhile.
[01:31:05] This makes it all worthwhile.
[01:31:06] Because you understand that after three years of war, this should be a notification to
[01:31:13] leaders around the world that if you think that you can just order people and that's going
[01:31:20] to work out for you, you're wrong, you're wrong.
[01:31:24] And you know, you, the way you worded something, I got to jump back to it.
[01:31:28] Because you said, you said, if you, something like if you can't explain to your people
[01:31:33] while you're doing something, then you're doing it wrong.
[01:31:36] I want to make it clear that when you say you're doing it wrong, you're talking about
[01:31:40] what you're telling them to do is wrong.
[01:31:43] Because if I say, hey, Dave, we want to assault this target from the West.
[01:31:47] And you're like, why?
[01:31:50] And I say, well, because that's the best spot.
[01:31:53] And you go, well, there's a channelized area.
[01:31:55] You're going to have to go through.
[01:31:55] And I say, no, we're going to go from the West.
[01:31:58] And you say, but there's an open area here from the South, where we can get cover on this
[01:32:02] to high ground, it will be, and I say, no, we're going from the West.
[01:32:08] And my only recourse is to say, no, Dave, I'm the boss.
[01:32:13] You're going from the West.
[01:32:15] You're doing it wrong.
[01:32:17] Yeah.
[01:32:18] Not just my leadership.
[01:32:19] You're doing the thing that you're trying to get done is wrong.
[01:32:22] Yeah.
[01:32:23] So worthwhile.
[01:32:26] Continues on.
[01:32:28] And you got to look at the 44.
[01:32:31] Like, it's almost like, here's the next one after this.
[01:32:35] In 1941, it was all troops assigned to the execution of a distinct mission should be placed
[01:32:39] under one command.
[01:32:41] The next, the very next line, after they eliminate that all troops assigned to the execution
[01:32:44] it's literally the same.
[01:32:46] They went through this thing and was like, hey, this is a pretty solid get rid of that
[01:32:49] line.
[01:32:50] Who, what turg, wrote that?
[01:32:53] So check.
[01:32:55] All troops assigned to the execution of a distinct mission should be placed under one command
[01:32:58] to function as a task force for the duration of the operation.
[01:33:02] So long as a commander can exercise effective command, he does not disturb the established
[01:33:06] chain of command in his force.
[01:33:09] In some situations, condition dictate that attachments belongs to be made to support
[01:33:12] in the commands.
[01:33:13] So this is something that, it's a little bit of this sometimes, like a group, a task unit,
[01:33:21] a battalion, a company gets assigned.
[01:33:25] And if the leader, if the overall leader doesn't have the wherewithal to say, okay, you
[01:33:30] know what?
[01:33:32] Task unit bruiser, you're supporting and task unit alpha, you're, you guys are running
[01:33:35] this.
[01:33:36] And the task unit bruiser guy, the task unit bruiser guy, the task unit bruiser guy,
[01:33:38] said, cool, hey, alpha, what do you need?
[01:33:41] So often it's like, man, I should have been the one maintenance.
[01:33:44] That should be me.
[01:33:46] And I remember a couple times early in task unit bruiser while I was trying to be trying
[01:33:51] to hang out with a fair fairy and be like, well, you know, we fake it.
[01:33:54] It's like, no, life you're running this one, Seth, your support, or Seth, you're running
[01:33:57] this one.
[01:33:58] That's the way it is.
[01:33:59] I think I tried that one time, like, oh, you guys can each be over here.
[01:34:03] No, stupid.
[01:34:08] And if your guys actually believe in the mission, it's no fact.
[01:34:10] It's never, they don't care at all.
[01:34:12] Roger that boss, I'm on it.
[01:34:13] Yeah.
[01:34:14] What do you need, man?
[01:34:15] Get it?
[01:34:16] The big picture if you'd explain the mission and they buy into it, you could put
[01:34:18] that guy as a support element forever.
[01:34:21] Yep.
[01:34:22] And he's like, no factor.
[01:34:22] No matter what you need.
[01:34:23] I will support all day long.
[01:34:25] What do you need?
[01:34:26] Not to mention half the time you go out there and the situation completely changes
[01:34:29] and the supporting effort becomes the main effort.
[01:34:31] Of course.
[01:34:32] Of course.
[01:34:33] Isn't it crazy though if you're working for me and I go, hey, Dave, you're supporting
[01:34:39] effort and you're like awesome.
[01:34:41] Got it.
[01:34:42] And then the next night, I'm like, hey, Dave, you're supporting effort and you say,
[01:34:46] awesome, got it.
[01:34:47] And then I say, hey, you know what?
[01:34:48] You're going to be supporting effort again.
[01:34:49] You're like, bring it.
[01:34:50] Yeah.
[01:34:51] I'm ready.
[01:34:52] We're getting this dialed.
[01:34:53] Hey, man, I need you to do supporting effort again.
[01:34:56] And you say, Roger that, we're already.
[01:34:59] So if that's your attitude, that's awesome.
[01:35:02] And eventually I go, hey, you know what, Dave?
[01:35:03] You're running this then.
[01:35:04] Guess it's going to be the main effort.
[01:35:05] Now, if I go, hey, Dave, you're the supporting effort.
[01:35:08] You go, okay.
[01:35:09] Okay.
[01:35:11] And then the next night I go, hey, you're supporting effort again.
[01:35:13] Why?
[01:35:14] I was supporting effort last night.
[01:35:16] I immediately hate you.
[01:35:18] Yes.
[01:35:19] Yeah.
[01:35:20] I immediately go, bro, is your ego really that out of control that on this
[01:35:23] random piece of paper, somewhere on this particular operation.
[01:35:27] On an operation that we have no idea where it's going to go or what's
[01:35:29] going to happen.
[01:35:30] You could end up being the element that's in the big giant fire fight that
[01:35:33] needs to step up.
[01:35:34] And you want your so concerned about that right now.
[01:35:37] That's where your priorities are.
[01:35:39] That that's where we're at.
[01:35:39] Okay, cool.
[01:35:40] No did.
[01:35:41] I will never make you.
[01:35:42] I'll never put you in charge of anything ever.
[01:35:44] Yeah.
[01:35:45] You know what?
[01:35:46] Nobody ever asked me in 23 years of conducting missions in the Marine
[01:35:49] Corps.
[01:35:50] Hey, were you assigned the main effort to read the support?
[01:35:52] Nobody cares.
[01:35:55] And yeah, it's the blend of the ego and just, hey, what's the best way to
[01:35:58] what's the thing I can do to help accomplish the mission?
[01:36:00] I mean, I don't care what it is.
[01:36:02] And by the way, if you and I meet and I say, hey, Dave, you know, I've been
[01:36:07] assigned supporter, you know, to you, which is kind of crap because I think my
[01:36:12] my, my company's better than your company, but whatever, that's what the
[01:36:16] boss decided.
[01:36:17] So tell me what you need and I'll do it.
[01:36:21] Like just think about that.
[01:36:23] And now when I say, hey, Dave, you know, we shouldn't do it like that.
[01:36:26] You will, you won't listen to a damn thing I say.
[01:36:30] But if I say, hey, Dave, hey, man, we're here to support.
[01:36:32] And if you need anything, tell me and let's get it done.
[01:36:37] And then we're now in a planning, I go, hey, what do you think about us setting up
[01:36:40] over here?
[01:36:41] You know, a little bit different than your thoughts, but what do you think of that?
[01:36:44] And you go, hmm, well, that's actually not a bad idea.
[01:36:47] So I have a little bit of humility and all of a sudden I can actually influence the
[01:36:50] situation a thousand times more than if I go in there with my chess boat out and my
[01:36:55] ego barking like a rabbit dog.
[01:36:58] Yeah.
[01:36:59] And the worst part about that is if you do that, your idea might actually still be better
[01:37:03] than mine.
[01:37:04] And I won't listen to you.
[01:37:05] Of course.
[01:37:06] Of course.
[01:37:07] It's just a freaking disaster.
[01:37:09] Just get on board for the entire team to win and it works out.
[01:37:13] Get on board for the big win.
[01:37:17] Add me to the situation and need tactical operation, the commander must quickly
[01:37:20] evaluate all available information bearing on his task, estimate the situation and reach
[01:37:26] a decision.
[01:37:27] The commander's estimate of situation is based on the mission of the unit.
[01:37:30] The means available to him and to the enemy, the conditions in his area of operations including
[01:37:35] the train and weather, the probable effects of various lines of action on future operations.
[01:37:41] The bases of these factors, he considers the lines of action opened to him.
[01:37:46] of successful will accomplish his mission and the lines of action with of which the enemy
[01:37:50] is physically capable and which can interfere with such accomplishment. He analyzes the opposing
[01:37:56] lines of action one against another to arrive at conclusions as to the probability of success
[01:38:01] for each of his own lines of action. There's a lot of words. Check all the different courses
[01:38:09] of action. See what the potential outcomes are. Move forward with one of them. On the basis of this
[01:38:16] analysis, he considers the relative advantages and disadvantages of his own lines of action
[01:38:20] and selects this line of action which most promises success regardless of what the enemy may do.
[01:38:25] If two or more lines of action appear equally promising, he chooses the one that will most
[01:38:30] favor future action. Pretty straightforward. The estimate often requires rapid thinking with consideration
[01:38:36] limited to essential factors. In campaign, exact conclusions concerning the enemy can seldom be drawn.
[01:38:43] To delay action and emergency because of insufficient information shows a lack of energetic
[01:38:48] leadership and may result in lost opportunities. The commander must take calculated risks.
[01:38:57] I read all that so I could say that last thing. Oudalu, strategic versus tactical. If you don't
[01:39:03] do anything in a tactical situation, you're going to lose. Then you're not going to know everything.
[01:39:10] No. Ever. Ever. You do not know the potential outcomes. Even if you have the best intelligence,
[01:39:18] it's going to change. Continue on. Considering the enemy's possible lines of action, the commander must
[01:39:24] guard against unwarranted belief that he has discovered the enemy's intentions and against ignoring
[01:39:30] other lines of action over to the enemy. This is what you said earlier. If you think you know what
[01:39:35] the enemy's going to do, you're wrong. Don't fall into that ego trap. Even when the weight of
[01:39:41] evidence warrants the belief that the enemy is committed to a definite line of action,
[01:39:46] the commander must bear in mind that it changes the enemy's plans may occur at any time.
[01:39:53] That's the way it happens. You gotta stay humble. The estimate of the situation culminates in the decision.
[01:39:58] Once a decision, a decision once made is not changed without some compelling reason. In combat,
[01:40:06] the will and energy of the commander must persist until the mission is accomplished. Estimation
[01:40:11] of the situation is, however, a continuous process and changed conditions may at any time
[01:40:18] call for a new decision. Two stubborn adherents to a previous decision may result in costly delay,
[01:40:25] loss of opportunity for decisive action or outright failure. The troop and fear and
[01:40:32] covered this very, very well. Sometimes, yeah, it's this. You want to stick with your plan,
[01:40:38] but you're constantly assessing to see if your plan was the right plan. If your decision was the
[01:40:42] right decision and if it's not, change. That's the utilip. Impits are happening all the time.
[01:40:48] As soon as I learned, hey, there's enough inputs. Tell me, I got to change. I got to do something different.
[01:40:51] And you better have the ability to maneuver. When you're making those, you may that decision
[01:40:57] you're taking action. You have to preserve the ability to maneuver because it's going to change
[01:41:02] period. Yeah. That's that over commitment. It starts to talk about terrain here.
[01:41:12] The part of the commander's estimate dealing with terrain often exercises decisive influence upon
[01:41:16] a decision in plan. The proper evaluation and utilization of the terrain reduce the disadvantage of
[01:41:20] incomplete information of the enemy. The more important features to be considered in evaluating terrain
[01:41:27] include not only natural ground forms such as mountain ridges, streams, bodies of water woods,
[01:41:32] and open spaces, but also artificial features such as roads, railroads, and towns. The commander's
[01:41:37] seeks always to utilize the terrain to his own advantage and to the enemy's disadvantage. Now,
[01:41:42] that's one of those things. Well, I definitely, for me, as a leader, when I, actually,
[01:41:52] as a leader, but more as an instructor, the difference between someone that sucks as a small
[01:42:03] element unit leader, small unit leader. Someone that doesn't do it right and someone that does it well,
[01:42:09] is someone that doesn't write utilizes the terrain and someone that doesn't, they don't. Yeah.
[01:42:14] So that's why I put that in there. But there's much more to it than that. And that is the fact that
[01:42:21] when you are leading people, when you're interacting with human beings, there's terrain that needs
[01:42:26] to be accounted for. The terrain isn't bridges, streams, and mountains. The terrain is ego.
[01:42:34] It's agendas. It's personalities. It's nuances that it's idiosyncrasies that people have.
[01:42:44] That's the terrain. That's so important. And it's that every single person you're
[01:42:51] interacting with is going to be a little bit different. And those idiosyncrasies and all those
[01:42:55] little small components, a good leader understands all of those different things. So the idea of what
[01:43:00] terrain is in their mind is all of that together. Yeah. I think you were setting me up for meeting
[01:43:09] and you gave me like an eight minute brief on the scenario that was happening. Like, hey,
[01:43:14] this is what's going on. This is this guy. This where it comes from. This is what he likes. This is the
[01:43:18] problem. He's had. Here's what I think he wants to do. And this is the approach I would take.
[01:43:26] And I was like, check, what did you just brief me on? You didn't mention trails and mountains,
[01:43:31] but you gave me the terrain brief that I was about to walk into. That's what it is. And then
[01:43:38] then when I walk into that meeting, instead of me being a leader that doesn't know what's happening,
[01:43:45] all of a sudden, I'm a leader that understands the terrain and can make the right maneuvers.
[01:43:50] No, you're terrain. Think about what, and really what this boils down to you from a
[01:43:58] leadership perspective in the business world is think of identify your terrain, right? Identify it.
[01:44:04] Let's let's talk about what that is and see how we can use it to our advantage.
[01:44:10] Next section is called conduct in battle. The commander's decision for his unit is a
[01:44:16] whole and the missions to subordinate units in support of the decision are communicated to
[01:44:21] subordinates by clearing concise orders, which give them freedom of action appropriate to their
[01:44:27] professional knowledge, to the situation, to their dependability, and to the team play desired.
[01:44:33] So again, I think there was a poge in the room. And sometimes the other guys were like,
[01:44:37] hey, bro, no, freedom of action is what these guys need. And they just had to like,
[01:44:42] sometimes we're add this stuff while the poge is out getting coffee. I think the poge was probably
[01:44:48] the senior guy in a couple times, he just overwrote him. But they just, they just like,
[01:44:54] he, they sent him to get, they went to a meeting and they did like several sections.
[01:44:58] That sentence is the exact opposite of what that said. Yeah. You know, a couple pages back.
[01:45:03] It's exact opposite thing. Freedom of action. Clearing concise orders, which gives them freedom of action,
[01:45:11] use that as your guide. Next, after providing for the issuance of orders, the commander places
[01:45:18] himself where he can best control the course of action in an exerted leadership. His command post
[01:45:23] affords the advantage of established signal communication. When opportunity offers and when his
[01:45:27] presence at the command post is not urgently required, he visits subordinates, commanders, and his
[01:45:32] troops in order to inspire competence, and to assure himself that his orders are understood
[01:45:37] and properly executed. Yep, you got it. The Navy, they started calling that deck plate leadership.
[01:45:41] Do you guys ever hear that? Say, you need to get out. You need to get out with the troops.
[01:45:45] You can't sit in the tariff conditioning space when you're got, you know, your, your
[01:45:50] boasts made down there in the well deck. Right. And it's 180 degrees in the well deck
[01:45:57] with diesel fumes. Yeah.
[01:46:01] Whenever the commander leaves his command post, he should orient his staff as to further plans to be
[01:46:06] made or measures to be taken in anticipation of future condensings and should inform his staff
[01:46:11] where he can be reached. Yep. During the decisive phase of battle, the place of the commander is
[01:46:17] near the critical point of action. Not in it, but near it, a commander influences the course of
[01:46:24] subsequent action by his leadership by the use of his reserves, by the concentration of artillery
[01:46:28] and other sporting fires, and by the employment of combat aviation and armored units.
[01:46:33] The duration of attack cooperation can seldom be predicted. Successful engagements,
[01:46:40] engagements, sometimes progress so slowly that gains made are not immediately imperant.
[01:46:46] A parent, other times they progress so fast that gains made can be capitalized only by the
[01:46:53] most aggressive and far-sighted leadership. Troops are used up rapidly in decisive phases of combat.
[01:47:00] This attrition must be anticipated by the commander and his staff who take timely measures for
[01:47:04] replacement of men, unit transport weapons, and for replenishment of ammunition and other supplies.
[01:47:09] When the situation permits troops which have been heavily engaged, are rested and reorganized
[01:47:15] before being assigned new and important mission.
[01:47:22] The staff assists the commander to the extent that he may require by providing information data
[01:47:27] and advice by preparing detailed plans in order to enhance the direction by exercising
[01:47:31] such supervision over the execution of his orders as he may prescribe. A staff officer as such
[01:47:37] does not exercise command. The staff may be divided into two groups. The general staff and the
[01:47:46] special staff in large units, these two staff groups are separate and distinct and small units
[01:47:50] that merge into each other. And one staff officer frequently is charged with the duties
[01:47:55] pertaining to both staff groups. Now the whole reason that I read the last two three paragraphs
[01:48:03] was so I could read this. In every headquarters there is a constant tendency to multiply
[01:48:10] personnel, expand the functions of staff administration and accumulate records and office equipment.
[01:48:19] And then this is one of the only thing that is italicized in this book. It says,
[01:48:24] the commander must avoid this expansion. He must organize his headquarters so as to maintain
[01:48:32] its readiness for improvement. So again, this is when the pope walked out of the room, they're like
[01:48:37] let the pope wrote all those other three paragraphs. He was in like the staff this and the staff
[01:48:41] commander and then these guys were like, listen, they're going to try and expand the staff.
[01:48:45] You don't need it. I was always surprised like there's a section on the staff.
[01:48:49] I was like, oh, do we need to put that? And I've been listening to even some of the other things,
[01:48:56] there's something that he said earlier even about that point of friction. I think really what he was
[01:49:00] saying is you'll burn through resources more quickly. Which is true. I understand that because that's
[01:49:04] where the culminating event is and that means you know your people have to be cycled through more
[01:49:09] quickly and you have to pull them out. There's a part of that that's true. For sure, the point of
[01:49:13] friction is going to require the most resources and the most energy and you're going to exert yourself
[01:49:17] the most. But there's a piece in there that probably needs to be worth expanding on a little bit
[01:49:21] is that the point of friction is actually if you're prepared and brief for it, those people actually
[01:49:27] have the most endurance because that's where they want to be. That's where they've been
[01:49:32] anticipating. That's the entire thing this whole build has been about as to get there and they're
[01:49:37] the most involved and the most engaged. Those people also have the most endurance. It's the places
[01:49:41] where there's at least amount going on, the least amount of friction where you feel you're
[01:49:45] making the least impact. Those are the people that are the first ones to really struggle because
[01:49:51] they feel disconnected and it's not 100% wrong the way they set it. But I wanted there to be a piece
[01:49:56] of saying, oh by the way, everybody wants to be at the point of friction on your team if you
[01:50:01] prepared and built them and those people can actually endure the longest. You still need to pull
[01:50:06] some of those folks off the line. You still need to assess how they're doing, but the people in most
[01:50:10] engaged are typically the people that are most willing to stay engaged the longest and that piece
[01:50:15] was missing in that last section there. And as this piece time hint to all these comments that are
[01:50:21] in there and like the point of friction, you would have to choke me out to get me away from that,
[01:50:28] to give me a chance to rest and to refit and again, it doesn't mean that you just let them go
[01:50:34] in the red forever. But there's just a part missing in there that this guy we're talking about,
[01:50:39] whoever this guy was, the poke. Yeah, the poke. The RAMF had a lot of influence on that. I'm like,
[01:50:45] what about the other part that says, oh by the way, that's everybody really wants to be.
[01:50:48] Yeah, because that guy doesn't want to be there. No. And he's like, all those guys need to break,
[01:50:53] like, I dare you to pull me off the line when things are at their most intense. Good luck
[01:50:58] getting me off the line. The next section is called combat orders. The authority to issue orders
[01:51:07] is an inherent function of command orders are normally issued to next subordinate commanders.
[01:51:12] By passing the normal channels of command is resorted only to an urgent situations. It's such
[01:51:18] cases both commander issuing the command or receiving the order should notify intermediate
[01:51:23] commanders of its purport as soon as possible. So, trying not to jump the chain of command.
[01:51:30] Well, orders may be either complete or fragmentary. The order is complete when it covers all the
[01:51:35] essential aspects of the phases of operations. Complete orders include missions to all subordinate
[01:51:40] units charged with the execution of tactical operations and carrying out the commander's plan.
[01:51:44] So that's a complete order. Fragmentary orders. And by the way, there's no distinction between
[01:51:52] these two things in the cupid funeral. So I think the pug was like no orders have to be detailed.
[01:52:00] And the guys were like, okay, yep, you're Roger that, sir. But, you know, there's something
[01:52:04] else that can happen maybe possibly like we call them. They made up fragmentary orders.
[01:52:08] Fractory orders are used when speeding delivery and execution is imperative. Guess who it's
[01:52:14] one you're going to do the most? Yeah, Frag orders are issued successfully as the situation
[01:52:19] develops and as decisions are made and consist of separate instructions to one of the force
[01:52:24] ofordinate units prescribed, prescribing each the part each is to play in the operation
[01:52:30] in the separate phases thereof. This procedure will be usual in divisions and smaller units
[01:52:37] that pugs knock that one in there. Fractory orders may be either all or written.
[01:52:45] They are concise but not at the expense of clarity and omission of essential information. That's very,
[01:52:51] very clear in the in the troupon funeral. Instructions issued in fragmentary orders may be repeated
[01:53:00] in a complete field order or in an annex of considered desirable order should be originated sufficiently
[01:53:07] sufficiently early and transmitted in such form as to permit subordinate commanders the maximum
[01:53:13] superior periods to recon order to estimate their own situations to issue their orders
[01:53:19] and to prepare their troops for the contemplated operation. In many situations, it may be necessary
[01:53:24] or desirable to order a worn of impending operations warning order, a warning order contains information
[01:53:34] which enables subordinate commanders to make preparations for a contemplated operation.
[01:53:41] It's principal purposes to gain the time for preparatory measures and to conserve the energy of
[01:53:46] the troops. So that is in the troupon funeral. The idea of a warning order and warning orders are
[01:53:51] awesome. The be prepared to. Here's what we're probably going to do. It's going to look something like
[01:53:58] this peck this gear think about that area of operations. And if I was going to take away something
[01:54:03] from this that long section there if I'm a leader at a business or a key leader in an organization,
[01:54:09] the takeaway for me is it may feel like you at the top of the workshop needs to
[01:54:15] talk to most give the most information actually what you should do is the time that you should
[01:54:19] maximize is your subordinate leaders going to figure out what they need to do to support your
[01:54:23] overall mission. The least amount of information you can pass. It it it has to be the right amount of
[01:54:28] information. But the more time you can give them to figure out their particular situation to support
[01:54:32] that the better. Less talking more time for your people to go dear their job as opposed to let's
[01:54:38] get everybody in the room. I'm going to talk all day long about every single detail and not give them
[01:54:42] any time to go figure out that's that's opposite. So the frigo in the warning o that's probably 95% of
[01:54:48] the way you're going to communicate is leader. Yeah once at your annual conference for for sure yeah
[01:54:52] we need to spend some time we'll do that but that's not going to happen on day to day and the
[01:54:56] West you talk is probably the better for your team because it gives them more time to lead.
[01:55:00] Yeah and those those detailed plans are going to change. They're going to change. Yeah. So
[01:55:08] you can you can if you got the relationships and you got the well trained people and you've got the
[01:55:14] trust built man the orders are so freaking simple the give and and that was the thing with and I
[01:55:22] didn't say this but that's the whole jumping the chain to command thing is what you really want
[01:55:27] there are time look don't jump the chain to command if you can vote it for sure that's a good
[01:55:30] blanket statement but the reality is is that are there times a jump the chain? Yes there are and the
[01:55:36] best thing I have when I jump the chain to command is whoever that leader that I bypassed to give
[01:55:41] direct orders or information to their folks if I got a really good relationship and a long history
[01:55:46] of them they don't even care there's no factor and I say and I'm so about hey Jaco you weren't
[01:55:50] around I had to make this thing happen this what we did in a while you're like good ago it sounds
[01:55:53] good it's the pug it's the guy who really likes the chain to command so you shouldn't bypass me
[01:56:00] to speak to my man is the guy who's most offended and it's probably the hardest relationship
[01:56:06] because what that guy cares about the most is his positional authority and there's so much in there
[01:56:12] on even the jump in the chain is you have a good relationship you can jump the channel all day long
[01:56:15] and I'm not saying you should go out of your way to do it but sometimes it's required and strong
[01:56:19] relationships and like yeah no factor thanks for giving the heads up my my guys back brief me anyway
[01:56:23] we're all good I'm all in yeah they told me what they're doing I got it appreciate it thanks yeah
[01:56:28] no factor people that are insecure about their leadership capabilities are the ones that really what
[01:56:32] that's the that's the false the poll the lieutenant kernel poll I think he's actually a
[01:56:38] kernel this poke kernel poke yeah no he's the senior guy yeah he's the senior guy and
[01:56:44] yeah kernel poggies in the house for some of us orders an order should not trespass upon the
[01:56:56] province of a subordinate it should contain everything that the subordinate must know to carry out
[01:57:05] his mission but nothing more I really like that order should not trespass upon the province of a
[01:57:14] subordinate yes like you got to let him run his thing tell him what he needs and then give him
[01:57:19] all the time in the world you can't get let him go lead orders must be clear and explicit
[01:57:25] and as brief as as is consistent with clarity short sentences are easily understood
[01:57:35] you know they're like hey kernel kernel poke do you mind if we just say that short sentences
[01:57:39] are easy to understand because some of the guys might not get that and he's like whoa I'd like
[01:57:43] to talk to you about that for a while clarity is more important in technique the more urgent
[01:57:48] the situation the greater the need for consciousness for conciseness in the order
[01:57:53] think about that the more urgent the situation the greater the need for conciseness in the order
[01:58:01] think it was Mark Twain that said I wanted to write you a short note but I didn't have time
[01:58:08] so I'm writing you this long letter which is easier than writing something short and concise
[01:58:14] I come back you tell the story a lot on the podcast and it's the bus that door just three
[01:58:21] it's just this the simplest and the reason you have to say it like that is because there's actually
[01:58:27] not any more time than you need to talk about hey well I feel like the enemy might be maneuvering
[01:58:33] bus that door and they go and they go do that and then problem solved totally
[01:58:38] any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to what is necessary to obtain
[01:58:44] an intelligent cooperation from the subordinates
[01:58:46] I'm reading that one again any statement of reasons for measures adopted should be limited to
[01:58:53] what is necessary to obtain intelligent cooperation from the subordinates there's a little bit
[01:58:58] there's a little argument about that one because the the poll kernel poll was like they don't
[01:59:04] you need to tell what to do you tell what to do and the other guys like listen you need to give
[01:59:08] them some information on why this is happening and he's like no you don't and they said yes you
[01:59:12] do and finally they wrote this statement it compromised yeah the compromise is like at least let them
[01:59:18] know give them what's limited so that they have have the information and can understand why it's
[01:59:25] happening now there are times when leaders give too much information and it overwhelms the machine gunner
[01:59:32] who's like bro tell me what my field of fire is for sure you tell me that again
[01:59:36] detailed instructions for a variety of contingencies or prescriptions that are a matter of training
[01:59:44] do not inspire confidence and have no place in order
[01:59:49] trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility and lead to the adoption of half measures
[01:59:55] by subordinate by subordinates trivial and meaningless expressions they're actually telling you how to
[02:00:02] write and how to speak yeah trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility and lead to the
[02:00:10] adoption of half measures by subordinates exaggerated and bombastic phrases invite ridicule and
[02:00:19] weaken the force of an order you cannot do that you cannot use exaggerated and bombastic phrases
[02:00:34] what what happens is you think you're not getting the message apart to your people yeah you think
[02:00:42] that they don't get it if we don't do this it's going to destroy the company and you're thinking
[02:00:47] the go I better pay attention and actually all that does is just undermine your message like bro yeah
[02:00:52] hang on that it's not going to destroy the company if you're the leader that if you can have
[02:01:00] these limited recognized you're the one that covers all these little detailed points your people are
[02:01:04] tuning you out they're tuning you out and actually what's going to happen is they're going to
[02:01:08] miss the important things so you just need to say just the important things yeah what you do is
[02:01:14] you paint yourself into a corner totally because if you're talking and you're saying this and
[02:01:20] you're saying that and then you're saying this and then you're saying that and then you finally
[02:01:22] want to say something important you want to make sure everyone pays attention so you put an
[02:01:25] exaggeration or you make it a bombastic phrase and then what you're end up doing is now you're
[02:01:31] making exaggerations and bombastic phrases all the time they have the impact and you're the
[02:01:36] you end up the the the boy that cried once last muster somebody asked you a question and the
[02:01:40] answer was basically kind of like how much talking how much listening and you're like 98%
[02:01:44] listening 2% talking and you pause and you're like now that I've thought about it that's the
[02:01:49] perfect ratio is just the least amount of things you can say to pass the peran information and then
[02:01:55] stop talking and if it's the the only way to compel your people to do it is that the risk is
[02:02:01] total destruction then the one in a million times that actually it could be total destruction
[02:02:07] they actually don't respond the way they need to they don't care because you've been saying that
[02:02:10] this could crush us this could destroy us like the one time that's that's true they've filtered
[02:02:16] you out years ago yeah yeah 98% of the time use your ears 2% of the time use your mouth
[02:02:26] I I would not talk on the radio in task being a bruiser as a particular I would not talk on the
[02:02:33] radio when I talked everybody listened totally and same thing you know when when one of
[02:02:40] two commanders are given a brief I'm not talking I got three things to say at the end maybe two
[02:02:45] here's what's important that's what you can do think about boom
[02:02:51] expressions such as attack vigorously if used in orders are not only verbose and meaning
[02:02:57] less but 10 to week in the force of subsequent orders in which such expressions are not there
[02:03:01] that's exactly what you were to say like you're gonna run out of adjectives bro
[02:03:08] this is critically important yeah yeah yeah there's the hierarchy of adjectives and you're
[02:03:13] gonna reach the end of it which is gonna suck next orders to prescribe only so far as conditions
[02:03:18] can be for scene orders which attempt to regulate matters too far in the future resultant frequent
[02:03:22] changes frequent changes in orders overload the means of signal communication cause confusion
[02:03:27] misunderstanding impose needless hardship on the troops and injure them around so there you go
[02:03:34] that's freaking epic right there totally you you sit there and you're trying to
[02:03:39] what I just said this deep we're gonna come out with a detail plan of how it's gonna go from day one
[02:03:42] to day 19 no you're not you're not and no one is and it it pisses your guys off
[02:03:51] for sure pisses them off for sure but I learned this lesson so I was on an argument deployment
[02:03:56] which meant I was on a ship and we were planning for some mission and at first they said okay you're
[02:04:03] gonna launch from you're gonna launch from the boats the the the rib boats the rigid
[02:04:08] hold flatable boats you load your zodiacs on there to put them in the water and you guys will
[02:04:12] go do your mission and so we start prepping for that and then they come back and they say
[02:04:16] actually sorry our bus you're gonna use helicopters so we're like okay now this is a totally
[02:04:22] different rigging exercise I mean completely different we have to we so we have to bring the zodiacs
[02:04:28] which we had rigged for boat launch we had to completely break them down and now rigged them to
[02:04:36] go inside of a CH 46 and get kicked out the back and then we jump in the water we go this takes us
[02:04:42] I'm not even kidding this takes six hours of hard labor and our five and a half comes back
[02:04:50] actually you're not using he loves your using boats again and there was like borderline just
[02:04:57] total breakdown of Chay to compare like are you kidding me because guess what we hadn't planned
[02:05:03] anything we hadn't done any of our personal gear prep all we were doing was and and when you're on an
[02:05:08] arg like you you go check out bringing a 55 horsepower engine from the flight deck next to the ribs
[02:05:16] down into the well back you know and then you do that with every piece of gear that you have
[02:05:22] well it it was just stupid and and of course this was a three minute conversation this is a
[02:05:27] decision a three minute conversation and a four-second decision that my upper chain of command
[02:05:33] above my patoon commanders you know was like oh it'd be good to get him some work in a he loves
[02:05:38] okay well yeah let's get the he loves going have him get ready for a he-lo it wasn't like okay
[02:05:42] are they committed no they just made a little decision and and I learned that in that moment in time
[02:05:50] when you're the guy in charge you better know what the hell your decisions yeah how your decision
[02:05:58] impact the list because not I look wasn't hard work yes but was even worse than the fact
[02:06:03] there was hard work we were not prepared now we had wasted it took us another six hours to get
[02:06:08] everything deregged so we were not planning the way we should have been planning because we were
[02:06:12] running around like idiots wasting time wasting time orders issued by subordinates should not
[02:06:22] be mere repetition of those from higher authority with additions of their own new orders are
[02:06:27] clearer and more satisfactory as a rule is desirable to keep contemplated operation secrets
[02:06:35] long as possible and to confine knowledge they're of to new to a few staff officers and senior
[02:06:40] commanders however upon entry into action no unit should be endowed as to what the commander wants to do
[02:06:49] whenever knowledge of his intentions is necessary to ensure the cooperation of units engaged
[02:06:54] the commander does not hesitate to disclose them to all concerned ignorance of his intentions may
[02:07:00] often lead to inactivity on the port on the part of subordinates commanders intent is the actual
[02:07:07] thing that you lead with it's the most important piece of information of all of it and when we
[02:07:12] work with companies all the time there's this phrase that people know it's like if you ever hear
[02:07:18] yourself or the people around you saying you don't need to know that just do your job man
[02:07:23] the likely heard of success is basically zero check it is impossible to prescribe detailed
[02:07:34] forms of orders to fit every tactical situation to attempt to do so would result in rigid form
[02:07:40] and a routine style of expression which would not be in accord with the in accord with the
[02:07:45] tactical requirements presented by the diverse situations that arise in war you don't know what's
[02:07:52] going to happen that circles back i think to the first sentence you read and war is like you can't
[02:07:55] script the answer you don't know what's going to happen to the extent practical however it has
[02:08:02] been found efficient and convenient to classify combat orders according to their purpose and scope
[02:08:07] of for some of these to adopt a standard sequence of composition this makes for the ease of understanding
[02:08:12] a voice of omissions and ready reference yeah for sure that's where you get smiac which they
[02:08:16] surprisingly don't cover they cover it in through perfuring but they don't cover it in this one um
[02:08:23] but that's what they're talking about moral experiences shown that an order which can be
[02:08:28] misunderstood will be misunderstood and an experience is shown that an order that which can be
[02:08:36] misunderstood will be misunderstood and to obviate the designations of boundaries details of time
[02:08:44] in place military terminology abbreviations designations of units and the like for details related to
[02:08:51] these matters cfm 101 tack five and i wrote tack one which is the operational turns and graphics
[02:08:57] which in the seal teams when the war kicked off we were not we didn't know what we were doing
[02:09:04] like in terms of operational terms and graphics we just kind of drew arrows and like made it obvious
[02:09:10] to the guys in the platoon like hey move there bad guys there we didn't we didn't realize that there
[02:09:16] was an actual an actual language that was utilized throughout all i remember when i was trying to
[02:09:26] convince people that we entire military oh it's through it's not just through our military it's all
[02:09:32] NATO forces by the way because i remember having i would be like hey listen you know you need to put
[02:09:37] this stuff in here there's this manual it's called the 101 tack i used it literally have the 101
[02:09:43] tack five tack one i had a printed copy and i had it in my bathroom i had like one copy of my bathroom
[02:09:48] and i would read through it you know because at some point i think i was probably
[02:09:56] i think i was probably a platoon commander and i realized like oh everyone uses this but us
[02:10:02] okay so i just started trying to learn terms and you know because we we don't have the basics
[02:10:09] school in the seal teams we don't even have you know advanced infantry training like they have
[02:10:15] in the army where you're gonna you you you go through platoon work but it's this isolated thing right
[02:10:20] it's this isolated thing and luckily i did two-hour deployments where we worked in Marine Corps
[02:10:24] extensively which was awesome and i got my taste and my indoctrination in how the rest of the
[02:10:32] freaking military works because you got big navy you got the Marine Corps you got Marine Corps
[02:10:36] air it was awesome i was so lucky that i got put in those situations and that's kind of where i
[02:10:41] first would see these things i'd be like oh that's an interesting symbol but you know it was
[02:10:44] pre-internet it wasn't like you could it wasn't like i could explore this idea but yeah i used to
[02:10:50] have one of those next to my bit but i remember trying to i would be telling guys like hey the symbol
[02:10:56] for the enemy actually isn't a red axe it's it's a diamond yeah and they'd be like well that's
[02:11:02] you know no no one's gonna know what that means actually everyone in NATO forces knows what
[02:11:08] that means the only people that don't know is the 16 guys in your seal platoon how about we get on
[02:11:12] board with what everyone else in the military is doing uh check and now we get this is the last
[02:11:22] section that's you know that's that's covered worth covering in every unit standing operating
[02:11:31] procedures is prescribed by the commander wherever practicable this procedures covers those features
[02:11:41] of the operation which lend themselves to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of
[02:11:45] effect in this the adoption of such procedures will save time in the preparation and issuance of
[02:11:50] orders minimize the chances for confusion and errors when under stress of combat and greatly
[02:11:56] simplify and expedite the execution of operations in the field pretty state straightforward
[02:12:02] and they close out talking about command posts which nothing they talk about signal communication
[02:12:09] which you know this is very tactical level stuff like how you're gonna communicate
[02:12:16] at during this time period with uh with message centers and advanced mess i mean it's it's like
[02:12:23] the actual how they're doing it so it's not super applicable other than the stuff that we've
[02:12:29] already covered about things being simple clear and concise I mean literally airplane messages
[02:12:34] may be employed when distance intervening obstacles on the ground enough factors prevent use of
[02:12:38] other means so that's what it's talking about it's it is actually talking to take a one step further
[02:12:43] homing pigeons are a mean communication from front to rear when other means a shell so that's where
[02:12:47] we're at i'm not gonna dive into all those things even though they are interesting and fascinating
[02:12:51] and we can i'm sure learn something but we're not gonna dive too deep so that's that's kind of
[02:12:57] where it wraps up and as i mentioned before the the 1944 version if if you look at that the the
[02:13:04] other than the differences don't want to point it out there's an entire big section of air power
[02:13:12] and and how you utilize it and then there's more granular tactics but again we're talking it's a
[02:13:18] little bit homing pigeon fish you know not not readily applicable as leaders but the but the
[02:13:27] leadership principles other than that one sentence that we pointed out other than that one sentence
[02:13:34] it's almost it doesn't change and it's very similar to the true inferior which is very similar
[02:13:43] to everything that we talk about all the time good leadership requires understanding people
[02:13:48] good leadership means you have to care about your men you have to as the book says show a constant
[02:13:56] concern for their comfort and welfare how about you make that a priority as a leader
[02:14:01] you can't unnecessarily tax the endurance of the troops discipline is the main cohesive
[02:14:12] force in a unit good morale cannot be improvised and and finally through offensive action
[02:14:23] through offensive action the commander exercises his initiative preserve his freedom of action
[02:14:30] and imposes his will on the enemy that's what we need to do is go on the offense on all fronts
[02:14:44] don't wait for orders don't wait for the intel to be perfect
[02:14:52] and if you have to be on the defense don't stay there look for that moment in time where you can
[02:14:58] flip this scenario go on the offense take ground move forward and impose your will on the enemy
[02:15:09] and yes that does translate to business and it certainly translates to what you do with your life
[02:15:16] the it go on offense when you wake up in the morning that's what you do don't wait to react
[02:15:23] you'll end up on the defense and you will eventually get taken out and I think that's all
[02:15:32] it got for this one anything else crazy isn't it so good man somebody will reach out to me and
[02:15:41] tell me who wrote this yeah that's what's gonna happen yeah somebody will reach out to me
[02:15:45] somebody reached out to me I've got a track on the FM one-tack three I've got a master I think it's
[02:15:56] a master gun resargent that was in the room who is a Vietnam guy yeah who's like oh you know it's
[02:16:06] I I want to say his son I think his son reached out to me hey just kind of F or maybe it was one of the
[02:16:14] guys who surf with him hey just FYI you know this guy was in the room we had a big part writing it
[02:16:20] and you know if you want to ask him some questions I'm like a 100% unfortunately since Colonel
[02:16:28] Pogue was probably 48 years old when he was doing this we won't get him in the room we don't need
[02:16:33] him in the room no you know the timing of that when you start when you look at the timing one
[02:16:38] there written I mean the takeaway you think about is you learn the hardest lessons from the most
[02:16:44] difficult situations and you learn the hardest lessons from the most challenging environments with
[02:16:49] your team and just think about how different the world was from 1920 to 1940 and then from 1941 to
[02:16:58] 1943 yeah and even if you looked at if you had a closed mind and you were looking at World War
[02:17:05] one even if even if Colonel Pogue served in World War one what he took away from that was like
[02:17:11] listen when I say charge there's just problems there's people that don't charge when I say
[02:17:15] charge that's horrible he might have been infatically saying listen obedience is the most important
[02:17:21] thing and there were some guys that were came back and you know when he said it at the first time
[02:17:24] they were like hey I know you were a platoon commander but like I was over here and we actually
[02:17:31] needed to think about what we were doing then after three years of war they just shut him down
[02:17:35] and said hey the methods that you used in World War one sucked and if we would have trained our
[02:17:41] troops to say hey boss that's a dumb idea we should not get up and charge this we should not go
[02:17:47] and online at 0600 when the when the bugle sounds I'm not doing it and we should not do it
[02:17:56] should not do this because we are going to lose 480 men when that bugle sounds and that's stupid
[02:18:04] yeah because we're going to get nothing out of it and so that's what we want and that's what
[02:18:13] this whole book begs for at least at least that at least the the the other guys in the room
[02:18:20] beg for people think that's what they beg for use your initiative question your boss
[02:18:28] if your boss can't explain why we're doing something then he's doing it wrong and a leader who
[02:18:35] has subordinates put that pushback and you hey boss hey I don't get this I don't think this is right
[02:18:42] that's the best leadership you can have I want my guys to go hey hang on I don't understand this
[02:18:48] that's the best feedback I could possibly get which is them saying timeout I don't understand
[02:18:54] we need to keep talking about this as opposed to one of two things the sort of this blind loyalty
[02:18:59] whether just do whatever I say because there's no way I've got it all right or worse they think
[02:19:04] this guy's an idiot and it's not even worth talking to him about it how disconnected those people are
[02:19:10] you if you're a leader you want your people pushing back you want them asking you hard questions and
[02:19:15] if you can't answer their questions you have more work to do yeah and and if you're smart
[02:19:22] the ones that you will charge with answering those questions is those men themselves that are asking
[02:19:29] them because if they say why are we coming in from the west you say well I thought it look good
[02:19:34] please tell me why you don't think that's gonna work go do a better map study then I did by the
[02:19:40] way because I got three other elements that I'm looking at but cool you come up with a better plan please
[02:19:45] we're standing my for that so yeah these these principles of combat man these principles of
[02:19:53] leadership they just don't change and it's so it's crazy that in 2019 right now you and I can
[02:20:03] work with leaders you and I can meet leaders that are 100% aligned with Colonel Pogue yeah
[02:20:11] there 100% aligned with Colonel Pogue they're attitude is listen hey what I want is people just
[02:20:17] doing I tell them to do and God that sounds good doesn't it this sounds great hey if he's going
[02:20:22] to just do what I told him to do here's the problem you're not that freaking smart you don't even know
[02:20:27] what they should do how can you you're not moving from lines you're not seeing what's happening you're
[02:20:32] not in that manufacturer you're not on that line you're not on that construction site you're not in
[02:20:37] that in that meeting you're you're you're you're supposed to be looking up and out so how can you
[02:20:44] know what's going on down there you don't let your people lead all right so speaking of going on
[02:20:56] offense we kind of want to go on offense in our lives I think that's a smart thing to do
[02:21:00] train you jitsu train you jitsu how many things you will be able to relate to jitsu is infinite
[02:21:09] it's going to make you better leader it's going to make you a better boss it's going to make you better
[02:21:14] follower it's going to make you a better dad make you better mom make you better human being
[02:21:20] and any it hopefully get your kids doing it too it's going to help them even more get them in the game
[02:21:25] so yeah jitsu if you need you jitsu ghee then get one from a place called origin origin main dot com
[02:21:35] where we're not just up there selling geese what we're doing is up there bringing manufacturing
[02:21:44] back to America that's what we're doing that's where belongs highest quality it supports this podcast
[02:21:51] if you like this podcast go to origin and get something that supports the podcast but more important
[02:21:56] like I said it supports the United States of America it supports the community up there that's what we're
[02:22:04] doing so origin main you can get t-shirts you can get joggers which I personally don't wear but I
[02:22:12] got to I'm going to say hoodies and jeans by the way jeans best jeans ever do you everywhere jeans
[02:22:20] Dave I cannot remember the last time of origins and I know that's you just wear shorts all
[02:22:27] the time when I lived in Virginia my criteria for shorts is it had to be below freezing so when
[02:22:32] you get a gig in New York City in January and you're flying out there what are you wearing on the
[02:22:37] point shorts really shorts at a national unfront t-shirt or a origin main t-shirt I might bring a
[02:22:45] hoodie if I think it's going to be chilly check so a hundred percent you're wearing shorts
[02:22:52] one hundred percent now here's here's one I look at a little caveat okay so 99 percent guess what I don't
[02:22:58] have yet oh oh oh day I'll tell you what so that's that's I'm sorry you know I see what you're doing
[02:23:06] so right now we have the heavyweight jeans and they're not they're not heavyweight they're not
[02:23:11] heavy your weight then they're just normal jeans I got jeans right now that are lightweight jeans
[02:23:20] and they're freaking the best things ever all right there is one thing that will push me off the
[02:23:25] 100 percent shorts that's the one yeah so that's my guess we got the material in um yeah it's you know
[02:23:32] made in America woven to grown in America so so anyways yep jeans the I'm going to call I think the
[02:23:38] name of the jeans is going to be May Kong 68 because if you don't know this the Vietnam
[02:23:47] Seals my forefathers the people that gave me everything I have today in the May Kong Delta
[02:23:55] of Vietnam the fatigues that we were that the seals were issued weren't durable enough for the
[02:24:03] operations that they were doing so they wore blue jeans and so May Kong 68 jeans and also

[02:27:52] it's the worst over use of special effects while they're being smashed while they're being smashed
[02:28:01] things are exploding but a lot of people like them including echo psychological warfare if you need that

[02:28:17] iTunes MP3 platforms of all kinds flipside canvas dot com that's Dakota Myers company and he's making
[02:28:26] shot in the arm that you can hang on the wall that's what it is a shot in the arm that you can hang
[02:28:32] on the wall so you wake up every morning you can see something that says discipline equals freedom
[02:28:36] I got some books the next book to come out is called leadership strategy and tactics field manual
[02:28:48] you can preorder it right now if you want the first edition I was talking to my publisher the other day
[02:28:55] and we're talking about what to do I said listen my people are there they want the first
[02:29:02] edition and I want them to know that they got the first edition so we're going to do something
[02:29:08] a lot of hundred percent sure yet but something to indicate at least that's the plan something to indicate
[02:29:14] that you got that first edition so you get one chance to be on the first edition train
[02:29:21] and then you're forever well I guess you could buy a used one for thousands of dollars off of
[02:29:25] eBay if you missed the if you missed the initial first the distrained and you know what'll
[02:29:32] let that happen so so leadership strategy and tactics really break down this stuff on a granular
[02:29:37] level on how to apply it in specific situations that you're in preorder that we're now way
[02:29:46] the way your kid there's three of them the most recent is where there's a will
[02:29:50] you're daughter it seems to be mega on the path right yeah I mean you got to be so proud
[02:30:02] dude she is dialed in man I'm I'm stoked and and we actually were talking about it the
[02:30:07] other day she is she had a right a little letter all the kids in the started school they had
[02:30:13] a right a little bio about themselves and kind of put it up in the wall to introduce themselves
[02:30:16] to the class and inside that biography it was talking about things that are important to you
[02:30:21] what do you think you like she used the phrase discipline she used the phrase ownership she said
[02:30:29] good people don't make excuses I didn't even know she wrote it so I went to back to school
[02:30:33] in that a couple weeks ago and I read it took a picture of it I'm like man this kid is so far ahead
[02:30:38] of where I was at that age it's Uncle Jake's been a good influence in her life
[02:30:44] Uncle Jake he has lessons for everyone but the problem is kids don't listen to their parents
[02:30:51] like they listen Uncle Jake it's just the way it is my own kids don't listen to me as much
[02:30:55] as they listen Uncle Jake that's just the way it is yeah their programmed to rebel against you
[02:31:01] they have to otherwise they'll be living at home when they're 38 years old you don't want that you
[02:31:06] want them to rebel against you but when they look outside for guidance you want them to find the
[02:31:12] right guidance there's Uncle Jake standing at a rigid parade rest ready to put out the word
[02:31:18] and if you're a parent you've now know and you're listening you now know you have those
[02:31:22] resources available to you because if you're like most parents when your kid rebels you know
[02:31:26] what most of us do we squash that which is the worst thing you can do personally first of all
[02:31:31] a way further and now you can say hey look I understand and now you've got some other you got some
[02:31:36] flanking maneuvers you can implement and have them because they're going to think they're
[02:31:40] figuring it out on their own which in some ways they are but the reason they're even getting
[02:31:43] there in the first place is because of you that's legit so way the warrior kid one two and three
[02:31:50] the first one's called way the warrior kid the second one's marks mission the third one is
[02:31:54] way the warrior kid through where there's a will got Mikey in the dragons how you gonna like just
[02:31:59] had this when I was on a field on this guy had he had called in the last time and had a kid on the
[02:32:08] way he was super freaked out and scared and he was like what should I do and you know it's like
[02:32:15] okay here's a plan to go forward and then we called him yesterday called the guy back and he's like
[02:32:22] yeah I got the kid and it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be in fact it's actually amazing
[02:32:27] and I was like yeah those dragons on this dragon's on this big is you think they're going to be so
[02:32:31] Mikey the dragon teacher kids to overcome teacher kids to stand up teach your kids to understand
[02:32:36] what fear is and how they can actually react to it in a positive way Mikey in the dragons
[02:32:43] get that book for kids that you know man it's another book I wish I had when I was little
[02:32:49] uh this one goes for you to field manual how to get after it yes you need that manual that's another one
[02:32:56] you what do you need to read to that a day read one page read one page and calibrate your brain
[02:33:03] for the day that's what it is brain calibration calibrate your brain one page a day it'll take you

[02:36:36] and I am at jokka will like Dave any closing thoughts on this one yeah one parting thought
[02:36:42] you're going through the books anytime I'm on the podcast which is completely awesome I get a
[02:36:46] lot of hits on social media asking me about the eminently qualified human being a project
[02:36:51] mm-hmm let me 74 174 one 74 podcast 174 let me tell you why you don't have that yet
[02:37:00] is because I simply haven't done a good enough job getting it done it is close but I am not doing
[02:37:09] my job we are getting very close that is coming out soon I will I will finish that project
[02:37:15] and I will get that done what about the app we are we finished an awesome beta test thank you for
[02:37:21] all of you out there that were dialed in on that we are close on that as well and what you're going to
[02:37:27] see pretty soon is the app getting released and hopefully a digital version of that but you guys
[02:37:32] are asking the questions the answer is I'm just not doing a good enough job it's coming soon
[02:37:36] the interesting thing about and I know this went when I said this to you you were like what
[02:37:41] and I was like hey well we'll get an app out you know we can build an app and release that
[02:37:45] like soon as soon as possible and you're like well wouldn't it be easier to like just print a
[02:37:50] publish a book and I'm like nope believe it or not it's a archaic system and we're not I don't
[02:37:58] we're not 100% certain of how we're going to roll that out but the priority is speed right
[02:38:06] this priority of getting the eminently qualified human being app and document book which we've also
[02:38:16] well we've we've actually we actually see we had a little mission creep right little mission
[02:38:21] creep because as I'm looking at it I'm thinking hey this is cool this is awesome but guess what there's
[02:38:27] some protocols that we could give people to be grew so now we've got some protocols in there for
[02:38:32] kind of standard operating procedures for things that go down in your life and they're really good
[02:38:37] they I didn't have that big picture vision we started working on it but with that some folks can
[02:38:42] ship you to that a lot of a lot of things are going into it it's certainly bigger but it ain't it's
[02:38:47] it's actually where it needs to be yeah it's pretty close right now here it's close man
[02:38:52] we got to just get out there okay cool so that's that and obviously once again
[02:38:57] we would not even be sitting in this room at all if it were not for our brave and courageous
[02:39:06] military men and women around the world so thanks to all of you that have served and those that are
[02:39:14] currently serving thank you and the same goes to our police and law enforcement the firefighters out there
[02:39:21] the paramedics the EMTs the dispatchers the correctional officers the border patrol the
[02:39:28] secret service to all the first responders once again without you we cannot live the life
[02:39:34] that we live here so thanks to all of you for what you're doing and to both your families
[02:39:42] that are supporting that are sacrificing thanks to your families as well and to everyone else out there
[02:39:53] life is a war right it is a war that's what it is at least at a minimum it's a metaphor for war
[02:40:03] it's a fight and there are people out there and there are things out there that are trying to take
[02:40:11] you down there is friction and there are obstacles and there is complacency
[02:40:20] and you might think when I say life's war you like well not really but check this out listen to me
[02:40:26] in this situation that you're in your life is at stake your life is actually at stake right now
[02:40:33] what you do with your life is at stake you are fighting for your life every day the way that you
[02:40:42] live it the mark that you're going to leave the legacy that you're going to leave the people
[02:40:47] that you help the people that you help people that you can help move forward the people that are
[02:40:56] weak that you can make stronger all that is going to come back to you that is your life and your
[02:41:03] life is at stake right now every day almost as if you are at war so don't sit back and be on the
[02:41:13] defense and allow life to happen to you don't do that instead go on the offense every day by getting up
[02:41:21] and getting after it and until next time this is Dave Burke and Jocco out
