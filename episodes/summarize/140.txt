To you, you know, it's a, you know, it's a, you know, it's a, you know, it's a, you know, it's just that idea, you know, like, so if someone's focusing so hard and being like perfect in every way and like knowing every single possible thing and just not showing any flaws, like focusing on it, maybe that's a mistake because they kind of created this connect. So like, you know, if you're, you know, if you like to play guard or you have a slick game from guard or whatever, if you train like an MMA training or training with strikes and stuff like that, it'll really expose where you're in danger in a real fight because that guy's gonna, you know, like it's gonna punch you in the face done there. But it this way I was in the game but it was like because I was like on the hype train you know how like I was like hey man everybody I'm doing this new thing and you're like fuck you just you know that just made you sound worse. yeah, if it sounds like, well, because I think anyway, and it has a lot to do with what you're used to, you know, where, like, if you're used to like a polished presentation and then all of a sudden, it's not polished, it's like, oh, he kind of fumbled through that. But you'll be like, all right, you know, okay, we understand is you, you do it for more like, hey, we're going to understand so we can take action or, you know, whatever. Could this mean to, you know, it's as, don't look too good in order to, like, you know, okay, this is the concept where, you know, when people make speeches or they'll, they'll have some sales pitch or something, and they'll want every word to be perfect. Would do anything not to fight let me tell you the best thing you can do as a human so that you don't have to fight is actually learn how to fight that is the best way to not have to fight is if you know how to fight if you know how to fight people are going to want to fight you you don't have to say anything they can tell. They're, you know, like, I, you know, what were your, warriors like you, Jocco and I was like, no, guys. And then someone else will come in and be like, oh my gosh this person's racist because Look what he said and maybe they'll play like you know the end part of the tape only or the beginning only or something like that. Like all those things, you want to help their ego and make them feel good to make them feel like you're on board of the program and not make them feel like you're going there questioning their call, because that's just an attack on their ego. But, yeah, I could see how that could be if someone's like, yeah, like, I don't know, someone who's not into necessarily the physical part of it as much as the mental part and maybe like the watch it. You should you know you should know some boxing you should know some wrestling you should know some more I should know some you just to for sure. And that's actually that's like a, because, you know how, like, I feel like you're kind of the example of that. And they're still smart as smart can be you know like they always were so now they got that and that additional like pay off you know that's where they get it to power But most people even when they said even when they tell you they want feedback they don't want it they don't want it like let me let me give you an example if you echo Charles yes would like you you made a video and it took you now right don't even. Like there's a big difference between like why did you do it that way me like in said saying hey echo that frame is doesn't look good. So, like, analyze like if someone's like, if I were to talk about haters, like, I could analyze that. It's funny like I know and people know our rea and I know and never really was into tea. And the other thing that he does is he takes it to us, like he'll say, imagine if you were imagine if America right now elected a person like he, so he brings it into like real time. We'll call it where like the average person is like, It's kind of like if you built a house, right? so I'm just getting smashed you know I can but this it's kind of like the more you know the better you are kind of think you know I did this I answer this question on Q and I did you think I was a good answer because I think you know I think could have been better Or these coaches that like maybe were going to something, but they, like, they know. But, you know, the person who just kind of gets a huge payoff in figuring out how things work and that's sort of it, you know, like in there. And there's a culture of embracing that to, you know, how people will be like, Hey, if you don't have haters, you're doing something wrong or something like that. Like, like, yes, like yesterday, the Dakot and I taught the, taught the new Jitsu people. And it's kind of like, hey, if I'm a, you know, I want to figure out how this, I don't know, this engine motor works. Again, it's interesting how that third or that additional element that they're not really used to like how you say nerds and you know, we'll just say like people who are more cerebral within physical. Like a little dig like, like I feel sorry for that. The next day I was like, what I was going to say is like, I was going to say eight mile run. It seems like it's not like you said, hey, I wanted to do this and say, you like drew it out. Yeah, but you get in it and you're just finding success just by learning it it's not like football where it's like sure I know how to catch. I was giving I was like a what he called back and listened to those podcasts and see if you were trying to act like you in the game even though we now know you weren't. But you can kind of feel sorry for him because it's like it's kind of a lonely, like actually I think when I say, I feel sorry for him. For on the big mats, and they're like, hey, who hasn't had any experience at all, or, you know, under a however, among their mom or something like that? Because that's when you're talking about, you know, a highly produced with the background music and all that stuff, like those podcasts, I don't, I don't like those as much. Yeah, and that's why so now they're in that's why people get addicted to because it's like this element of physicality like a physical fighting mark fighting sport by the way combat sport. The point is it's not just like people who want to just, you know, get after their Jitsu game, and they've been in it for years and years, and they want to camp out and do it. I definitely recommend that and there's going to be a big dichotomy here I'm going to get to but you should know some basics right you should understand for that you should not have content with other people. You know, so it's like, if you're, if you're okay, so here's the scenario I'd find myself in where the guy I'm going to get, this is a way better strike. I know like an internal protocols like, Okay, I'm emotionally attached to this situation. Right, you know what I'm saying like you could come to me and say hey what do you think Yeah, interestingly like a lot of the people that you meet in Gigi to or just like this where I'm interested in martial arts, but I'm not interested in fighting no better.
