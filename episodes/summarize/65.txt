and and I remember that that bond that we had an in task unit bruiser you know so often you get what the seals are doing their thing and you got the support personnel that are running the radios and the C.B.s that run the cabinet they just do different stuff and they don't you know what was so awesome about task in bruiser was like you lined those trucks up and we know we're going out you know we're going out at operation and and if you were weren't if you weren't coming on the op I know you would you would always be out there you know out there shaking everybody's hands and talking to him and and not in a way of like you know not in a way that there was more bit right but in a way of like just the respects and knowledge that any time we're going out like any one time there may be there may be any of these guys that are all now may not become a back from this they may be coming back in a body back and and that we had to be ready for that at all the time because it was almost a daily daily thing and I just not you know for for you and the the support personnel the comms guys you know our our our radio when that route there these aren't seals and they're you know does it say hey we wrote a book that's having some impact but when you see the things that they're doing when they're implementing extreme ownership when they're using cover move and they're not focused on themselves but about the mission and work together as a team and and using decentralized community you know it's playing the why to their teams and and the results are amazing you know see that happen and and that's really you know that's really what it's all about for us I think is seeing that kind of impact so it's been awesome to see that and looking forward for that to continue to grow and expand it's reach across the globe you know we we talk about in the book we talk about work on the Iraqi soldiers and one of the hardest things obviously even if you took a great soldier but they don't speak the language you speak any of a language barrier that's a real problem so a lot of times in these teams what the book gives them what the extreme ownership gives them it gives them a a language common language to talk about the issues the leadership problems that they're having they can identify because how can you fight an enemy that you can identify so if you know if you don't know that hey our decentralized command is weak and if you don't know what that is and you can identify how can you fix it if you got a cover move to solve problems and work together but you don't know what that looks like or you don't even know what to call it how are you going to get it solved so that's one of the things that I notice when we show up at a company that already is using it and have read it they're immediately saying you know and we are our our zero four four four five club PT's that we're cranking out these awesome workouts and and we I mean all levels of athletes there's some really high in you know athletes or black credible and you know you did two players to to the you know just just some folks who've just started training or just started hitting the gym and encouraged to but podcast or whatnot and came out participating that and and walking you know jogging over to or walking back from those those workouts talking those leaders and people talking what would you do in this situation you know I remember having those conversations with people and you're helping them apply that stuff we've heard do social media so many of those people some of those specific conversations like I can't believe how good this word here's what's going on I'm not I'm not able to I just got a promotion you know based on this you know those kind of that kind of feedback we always talk about so I'm gonna be able to watch more you know that even thought I needed so ridiculous amount of weight that I'm carried and so we load up I mean I'm having a hard time even just you know picking this bag up put it in so we load up in our vehicles we drive we meet up with the Marines we're loading up into their big seven ton trucks that they took in and they put the troops in the back these huge vehicles and that that was they would kind of drive you on the outskirts of the bad areas on roads they cleared and hopefully you were protecting and you know in those in those vehicles from from the armor then we unloaded and we unloaded from the vehicles once we got to a point and just so everyone knows these are like madmax scenario vehicles that people that that people military guys had had put steel on the sides you know half in steel on the sides to protect from rounds sandbags on the floor you know just put sandbags all over the floor so it's not like when when when he's talking about an armored vehicle don't think of a tank through or a Bradley fighting vehicle he's talking about a madmax scenario big giant seven ton truck that it looks like a construction truck and so they did a really good job of of suckering us in on that on that first patrol because they said hey we're just going to send you guys out on a shake out patrol tonight and so a shake out patrol in the sealed teams means you're going to put your gear on you want to see how everything rides on your body you want to make sure that it's comfortable you want to make sure that there's no you know tags that are wearing on you or anything like that that's just a shake out patrol get your little hand signals make sure we're all good to go get to know each other a little bit it's just like a little it's basically like a little walk like like a little walk I mean if they think it's probably going to take a shake out patrol should probably take you know you know what I'm doing go back to the book right now here we go they were called legs or grunts to carry something was to hump it as when lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps almost everyone humped photographs in his wallet lieutenant cross carry two photographs of Martha as a first lieutenant and platoon leader Jimmy Cross carried a compass map code books binoculars and a 45 caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded he carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men as an RTO Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC 25 radio a killer 26 pounds with its battery as a medic rat Kylie carried a canvis satchel filled with morphine and plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the things a medic must carry including mnms for especially bad wounds for a total weight of nearly 18 pounds as a big man therefore a machine gunner Henry Dobb Dobbins carried the m60 which weighed 23 pounds unloaded but which was almost always loaded in addition Dobbins carried between 10 15 pounds of ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders they all carried ghosts when dark came they would move out single file across the meadows and pattys to their ambush coordinates where they would quietly set up the claymores and lie down and spend the night waiting in that section when I was reading that clearly this is very similar to the operations that you conducted a ton of which was they're called a manborses here and we call them sniper overwatches but the idea you know the idea for those of what was happening is very very similar you know you guys are patrolling out to a location just like you talked about setting up for remain over day or for the night how did you feel like you know you kind of talked about it but did you feel like you were ready for that stuff oh maybe it's the TV spots that we don't know we didn't do that either so word of mouth it is exactly and not you know for that that's the real testament I think for you know for me that we wrote a book that's resin with leaders that's helping them get better to lead better teams for people to to be better teammates and employ these concepts in extreme ownership you know when we see them you know the the fire service training that's going on you know and face firefighters are using that as they're they're training man in a conduct in these these training or we see police police units doing it we see businesses you know and some of them bring us in and have training some of them they're holding their own training they're buying that book and they're they're learning out of it yeah below your nose just that just how it is over there just it was all just everywhere good times I'm taking this back to the book they moved like mules by daylight they took sniper fire at night they were mortored but it was not battle it was just the endless march village to village without purpose nothing one or lost they marched for the sake of the march they plotted along slowly, dumbling, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking all blood and bone, simple grunts, soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down into the patties and across the rivers and up and down again just pumping one step and then the next and then another but no volition no will because it was automatic it was anatomy and the war was entirely a matter of posture and courage the hump was everything a kind of inertia a kind of emptiness, a doneness of desire and intellect and conscious and hope and human sensibility their principles were in their feet their calculations were biological they had no sense of strategy or mission they searched the villages without knowing what to look for not caring kicking over jars of rice frisking children and old men blowing tunnels sometimes settings fires and sometimes not then forming up and moving on to the next village then other villages where it would always be the same they carried their own lives the pressures were enormous in the heat of early afternoon they would remove their helmets and flat jackets walking bear which was dangerous but which helped ease the strain now that that section obviously paints something different than what we experienced because and you can see what he's talking about you know you've got soldiers that don't know what the mission is that don't understand what the strategy is and you know there's all kinds of books about Vietnam and and at the highest you know we talk about sometimes how maybe we didn't do a good job of telling people what the strategy was but at the highest levels in the Vietnam war there's confusion on what the strategy just so there's no way that some frontline grunt understands why he's clearing this village and not that village or why it's that village and not this village they just don't know and I want to make sure that I've thought through all the contenders you know are we ready you know for for these worst case scenarios have we have we planned you know have we rehearsed these things have we tried have we thought what the enemy might do how could they hit us where we had even for senior you know that that burden that you just carried all the time and and for me you know man after after Mark I killed and Ryan got wounded it was just you know four months in our deployment it was just this recognition like man we're that can happen at any time that's it's like this common human emotion that you just make these assumptions and so the only way that units are going to stay focused and not have that happen when they've got good leaders they got a fire team leader in charge of his four guys to step up and make sure that his guys are squirt away and stay in focus they've got to you know they've got a squad leader making sure that his squad is squirt the LPO leading pet officers out there make sure that guys are dialed they're not cutting corners I mean I always saw that with guys you know we've been these type of Overwatch positions you got like some of them had like one stairwell in and out and someone's gonna watch that stairwell someone's got to have a weapon and look down that stairwell for 72 hours but look I think the reality was you were helping reinforce the lesson that you got to have your gear square to away you got to be ready for a contingency like that because that happened all the time to us you know where we like hey this is going to be you know obviously we're in Ramadi and we're like hey this is gonna be a 24 hour operation like no now it's a 48 hour operation now it turns into 72 hour operation we're gonna we're gonna stay here longer than we thought so you got to have you got to be square to be thinking about that and and I know you know we were kind of talking about this a little bit you know when you write a book you're confined in in some way to the structure of the book and to the length of the book and to the balance of the book and so you can't just drill down on some facet that might be it might not be totally pertinent to that particular way that it's laid out but what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to get next time you come on we got to do we got to do our own book we're going to do extreme ownership at least get it through a few chapters because because we we know the authors you know one more thing you know extra mag here extra mag there so you know I've got I've got those extra hand grenades I've got the extra a smoke grenades I've got you know I've got flash bang grenades I've got I've got you know four five extra magazines in addition to like the seven magazines and each of these are 30 round magazines we can you must have a hundred miles you can't at least raise them crazy amount of and then of course I've got my I'm carrying my 40 mic mic that's the that's the thing that fuels people and he just talks about this tiny percentage of men that will overcome that and they'll be brave and to think that we were lucky enough to serve with guys in our task unit and to see the next task unit come in and to see the soldiers and see the marines to overcome that strain on a daily basis that is absolutely one of the most humbling things that I think I will ever experience in my life that's what that's what courage all about you know I think just to to see guys you know that are just in the thick of the fight with bullets missing their heads by inches you know I remember our member on the rooftop of building 99 right on 20th street in the world we were getting hammered I mean enemy rounds coming in by hundreds and hundreds of rounds coming in shattered windows and I remember our EOD bomb disposal technician awesome awesome guys he's he's laying on the rooftop and there's armor piercing rounds coming through the roof punching through concrete wall you know that's just like three inches over his head and he's just laying there and and I remember crawling up there trying to figure out he's there by okay so they'll be one early in the morning so like before the sun comes up and we had to be in place you know you're going you're going in emitator you had to be in the building locked down ready to go because as soon as the call to prayer goes down you know that the city's gonna start awakening you know we're gonna start you know coming out of their houses and cars start n up and people moving around and and the sun's gonna come up you know pretty soon
