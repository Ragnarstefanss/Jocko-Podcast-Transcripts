00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.68 This is Jockel Podcast number 256 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.
00:00:07.44 --> 00:00:12.64 Good evening, Echo. Good evening. And joining us once again is Dave Burke,
00:00:12.64 --> 00:00:19.76 Good evening, Dave. Good evening. And tonight we are going to rap the final installment
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:26.56 on guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark. This is the subject of podcast's
00:00:26.56 --> 00:00:35.68 plural 251 252 253 254 255 and now find me 256 so much to learn taking the lessons that were
00:00:35.68 --> 00:00:41.28 passed on to Colonel David Hackworth who served the career of Vietnam wrote the book about face
00:00:41.92 --> 00:00:48.64 taught me many leadership lessons well he learned those lessons from this book written by General Bruce Clark
00:00:48.64 --> 00:00:56.32 who served in Korea World War II World War I who led many soldiers trained even more
00:00:57.92 --> 00:01:06.16 including one that he didn't even know about me. And we are trying to pass those lessons on.
00:01:06.16 --> 00:01:14.80 So for the final installment let's get back to the book guidelines for the leader and commander
00:01:14.80 --> 00:01:22.48 chapter 11 physical conditioning there you go Echo Charles. I'm sure your interest just got peaked.
00:01:23.36 --> 00:01:28.48 Here we go. I would like to pass on to you for such implementation as maybe practical
00:01:28.48 --> 00:01:32.48 within your several commands and within your various types of headquarters and units some
00:01:32.48 --> 00:01:36.64 thoughts on the problem of physical exercise, physical condition and physical training.
00:01:36.64 --> 00:01:42.96 This is a complex subject. It success depends on the program. Each commander works out
00:01:42.96 --> 00:01:49.04 to fit his needs and facilities and then enthusiastically and energetically pushes. While many
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:55.20 of our units and individuals are in fine physical shape this is not universally true in many commands.
00:01:56.08 --> 00:02:03.52 I believe it can be made more nearly universally true by a more general concept as to its importance
00:02:03.52 --> 00:02:08.88 and to a consideration of the implementation of practical steps that can be taken in this field
00:02:08.88 --> 00:02:15.36 without materially interfering with our other activities. What greater you giving general
00:02:15.36 --> 00:02:20.32 Clark for simplicity on that whole opening? I'm not getting them a good grade. Luckily he redeemed
00:02:20.32 --> 00:02:24.40 your energy he redeemed himself in the end of this book with some real simple clear concise.
00:02:26.24 --> 00:02:30.24 So he thinks that you know the simple statement is people should be working out.
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:36.72 I believe strongly that good physical condition is one of the evidences of the
00:02:36.72 --> 00:02:43.92 free in a unit as well as of morale in an individual. So it helps both your team and you as a person.
00:02:43.92 --> 00:02:51.28 Now here's where we have a serious beef. Serious beef. Probably one of the most serious beefs
00:02:51.28 --> 00:02:59.44 ever for me with general Clark. This topic is called calistenics at end of day.
00:03:01.12 --> 00:03:05.92 Echo you're probably going to want to throw down with this one. You're going to throw in with him.
00:03:05.92 --> 00:03:10.88 On one occasion I visited a unit and observed calistenics being conducted during the first period
00:03:10.88 --> 00:03:14.96 of the morning. This was being done in the normal way by a junior sergeant conducting the
00:03:14.96 --> 00:03:21.68 exercises with the senior non-commissioned officers and officers standing around to supervise and monitor.
00:03:22.48 --> 00:03:26.72 Possibly the ones who needed the exercise the most were the ones observing. That's a good one.
00:03:26.72 --> 00:03:30.64 You don't want to be that guy. You don't want to be that guy that's standing there with
00:03:30.64 --> 00:03:37.28 a small arms telling people they need to do more pull ups, right? You don't want to find yourself
00:03:37.28 --> 00:03:44.08 in that situation. No, you're not going to. No, sorry. But then he says this, I do not think calistenics
00:03:44.08 --> 00:03:49.84 or other physical training exercise in the first hour of the day is good. Of course, as we know,
00:03:51.68 --> 00:03:55.84 definitely think that working out in the first hour of the day is good. If they are done
00:03:55.84 --> 00:04:02.08 strenuously enough to be of any value so that the men work up the perspiration, the men then
00:04:02.08 --> 00:04:07.76 wear the same wet clothes throughout the day or until such clothing dries off them. Similarly,
00:04:07.76 --> 00:04:11.92 if men performed exercise or requiring them to sit on the ground or lie on the ground, they start
00:04:11.92 --> 00:04:16.32 off the day with dirty and maybe wet clothing. Now for me, general clerk, I'll do respect. I think
00:04:16.32 --> 00:04:21.04 we can just take a shower and change clothes when we're done working out. I think we can overcome
00:04:21.04 --> 00:04:27.36 that in the modern era. Yeah, I got to admit that kind of surprised me as being the first reason
00:04:27.36 --> 00:04:31.52 that he's talking about. Yeah, why not to work out first thing in the morning? Yeah, because we could
00:04:31.52 --> 00:04:38.16 just we could just shower. Seems easy to solve that from you. I will say this though. I think he's
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:44.32 coming from a time period where they didn't have this full like this was only an idea that was just
00:04:44.32 --> 00:04:49.76 coming to fruition, right? So it wasn't a thing yet. It wasn't a thing to work out. So people didn't
00:04:49.76 --> 00:04:57.76 have work out clothes. People didn't have work out shoes. People didn't have work out bag. You know,
00:04:57.76 --> 00:05:02.56 these people didn't have a workout bag. Didn't have your little freaking re-bock bag or whatever
00:05:02.56 --> 00:05:10.64 that echo Charles takes to 24 hours of fitness. So get your curls on. So they didn't have that back then.
00:05:10.64 --> 00:05:13.84 So he's thinking, yeah, you showed to work and the first thing we're going to do is build up a
00:05:13.84 --> 00:05:16.80 sweat and our going to be wet the clothes all day. All right, we'll give you, we'll cut you some
00:05:16.80 --> 00:05:23.44 slack. And then he says, I believe it is far more reasonable to devote the last hour in the afternoon
00:05:23.44 --> 00:05:29.84 to physical exercising and physical training so that the men can go from it to the showers and get
00:05:29.84 --> 00:05:35.44 into other clothing for supper and the evening. This is the time when the mind is tired and training
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:41.52 requiring mental attention is least effective. Okay, so that's okay. So all right, so we're going to
00:05:41.52 --> 00:05:44.96 just going to jump past like all the whole thing about the doing you're working out. Because I think
00:05:44.96 --> 00:05:50.32 it's just, I think we're beyond that now in the modern era. Yeah. I don't think we're, I think we can
00:05:50.32 --> 00:05:55.76 work out whenever it makes the most sense not based on our sweat and clothing. I think can we put
00:05:55.76 --> 00:06:02.08 that, can we set that one aside? I agree. So now this is interesting. This is the time when the mind
00:06:02.08 --> 00:06:07.60 is tired and training requiring mental attention is least effective. Doesn't it take a certain
00:06:07.60 --> 00:06:18.16 level of mental effort to do a hard workout? Don't you think? Is it Dave? Yes. I wonder if he's thinking
00:06:18.16 --> 00:06:24.72 like intellectual effort. Right? I get that and I get that too like for instance, this might
00:06:24.72 --> 00:06:34.24 sound stupid. When I'm going to, when I'm going to, let's say it's late at night and I'm like tired
00:06:34.24 --> 00:06:42.08 and I've got some more reading to do. I'll read until I'm just going to fall asleep and then I'll
00:06:42.08 --> 00:06:48.72 get up and brush my teeth, whatever take my supplements as echo likes to say. So I'll do my little
00:06:48.72 --> 00:06:56.48 evening routine floss and then, and then I'll have like, you know, I stood up. So now I'm, I can read a
00:06:56.48 --> 00:07:01.52 little bit longer. I can go a little bit longer and then I go to sleep. So when you do something,
00:07:01.52 --> 00:07:06.72 I guess that, that what I'm saying is you get bored. So maybe this is a good plan. Hey, it's the
00:07:06.72 --> 00:07:11.68 end of the day. You're kind of tired. You don't feel like focusing on this, what you call it, Dave,
00:07:11.68 --> 00:07:17.20 intellectual work. Yeah. Yeah, you don't, you don't, you're, you've spent your intellectual energy,
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:24.40 but you can still just go jack some steel possibly. Okay. I don't agree. I don't agree. I think
00:07:24.40 --> 00:07:31.36 that that's the case for some of us that like, no, man, when you're mentally exhausted, I mean,
00:07:31.36 --> 00:07:36.56 sure there are some circumstances, but as a general sort of way and approach to working on,
00:07:36.56 --> 00:07:40.24 and no, man, I don't know if I can get there quite yet. Okay. But we'll see what you're doing.
00:07:40.24 --> 00:07:45.36 So you want to have, you want to be mentally fresh for your workout. Yes. Okay.
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:50.96 All right, back to the book in two divisions at NIN number gate in which I served, everyone
00:07:50.96 --> 00:07:55.44 stopped activities at four o'clock on two days a week with the exception of the necessary
00:07:55.44 --> 00:07:59.76 duty officers, guards and everyone from the, from the commanding general. Everyone from the commanding
00:07:59.76 --> 00:08:05.44 general on down took physical exercises. This physical exercising consisted of activities that
00:08:05.44 --> 00:08:14.56 provided a real workout, none of this echo Charles. Real workout. Certain well organized selected
00:08:14.56 --> 00:08:20.08 games were allowed, provided that everyone played organized calisthenics were allowed, but the bulk
00:08:20.08 --> 00:08:28.64 of the units engaged in a four mile trot and fast walk to be completed in 50 minutes. Yes,
00:08:28.64 --> 00:08:32.88 bro, we're talking 12 minute miles or whatever. This is not a challenge.
00:08:34.08 --> 00:08:36.88 And here's what, as I thought through this, it started to make a little bit more sense.
00:08:37.52 --> 00:08:41.36 Combat boots with proper socks were worn by all personnel in order to get the men used to
00:08:41.68 --> 00:08:45.52 prevent damage to their feet, right? Above the top of the boots, everyone was permitted to
00:08:45.52 --> 00:08:50.80 prescribe their own uniform within the realm of decency. This gave men a feeling of freedom
00:08:50.80 --> 00:08:55.04 which added to the relaxation and benefit of exercise. Okay. So that's cool. I do not think
00:08:55.04 --> 00:09:02.32 this lack of uniformity hurt the discipline of the unit. It was not a show. Men traveled the
00:09:02.32 --> 00:09:07.28 previously laid out formal courses as individuals being checked at the start and finished
00:09:07.28 --> 00:09:12.48 to record their times in order to motivate the slow ones by falling. So this is just, you know,
00:09:12.48 --> 00:09:18.16 you just kind of prescribes this weird like four mile walk that everyone's going to go on,
00:09:18.16 --> 00:09:24.72 which tells me earlier when I said they weren't that working out wasn't really like a thing.
00:09:24.72 --> 00:09:30.80 Yeah, it wasn't because if they're thinking 50 minutes and four miles, but the only thing I can say
00:09:30.80 --> 00:09:37.36 about that also is if you're talking about a whole division or a whole brigade of people,
00:09:37.36 --> 00:09:43.68 like these are not all front line soldiers, obviously. These are administrative people and
00:09:44.48 --> 00:09:52.40 whatever the general himself. So yeah, I don't know. By falling the courses individuals instead of
00:09:52.40 --> 00:09:57.04 formation, no one exercise so strenuously as to do himself damage regardless of his physical
00:09:57.04 --> 00:10:04.56 condition or age, care should be taken in starting such a program to work into a reasonably
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:11.84 so as not to increase the sick call rate. I think if you if you imagine like a corporation,
00:10:11.84 --> 00:10:17.04 like a giant corporation and division size corporation with whatever 10 or 15,000 people
00:10:17.04 --> 00:10:22.08 and they were going to start a physical training program, this might be an okay program. You got 50 minutes,
00:10:22.08 --> 00:10:26.16 you got to go out, you got to move four miles, go for a walk, whatever. I think that's
00:10:26.96 --> 00:10:29.44 I think that's almost the perspective that he's coming from.
00:10:35.28 --> 00:10:39.76 I don't know, though, because didn't he just say a real work? Yeah, and there should be
00:10:39.76 --> 00:10:45.20 sweating. I mean, I'm not sweating after a after 12 minute miles for four miles and I swear to
00:10:45.20 --> 00:10:54.72 a lot as you know. Well, let's just be thankful that we are where we are, where we've learned
00:10:54.72 --> 00:11:00.72 so much about physical training and which has changed a lot. I mean, did you see that picture I
00:11:00.72 --> 00:11:05.36 posed at the other day of I was like yelling at one of my friends back in the day and he's doing
00:11:05.36 --> 00:11:13.52 cable crossover. I couldn't tell what he's doing. He's doing just cable crossovers. Yeah, oh yeah.
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:18.32 Hardcore building the thing that's building the what the lower packs.
00:11:21.52 --> 00:11:26.08 Leave it to you to try to yell at him while he's doing that. It's just like you think dead
00:11:26.08 --> 00:11:30.56 I think we were just messing around actually. Physical exercise program, the Secretary of
00:11:30.56 --> 00:11:34.96 the Army has written to commanders about the tendency to move troops from barracks to work and
00:11:34.96 --> 00:11:40.24 from barracks to training areas by vehicle instead of marching them when it is practical. Well,
00:11:40.24 --> 00:11:44.32 two march. He pointed out that is very important that the troops retain the ability to march
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:51.76 and especially was and this was especially important in mechanized and motorized armor units. So
00:11:51.76 --> 00:11:57.76 that's a great point. When you have the opportunity to march instead of riding a vehicle,
00:11:57.76 --> 00:12:03.60 you should march instead of riding a vehicle. That's one thing that's cool about buds. In buds,
00:12:03.60 --> 00:12:08.32 you run to dent, you run to breakfast and back, you run to lunch and back, you run to dinner and back.
00:12:08.32 --> 00:12:13.92 It's milder, it's milder. You're doing six miles a day before anything. Before the day before you
00:12:13.92 --> 00:12:20.88 get credit for anything, you ran six miles. Yeah. As a pilot, do you, because I was watching some
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:28.32 videos of some pilots that I came across. And do you guys kind of have to stay in physical
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:35.60 condition just to endure like flying a plane essentially? I mean, the physical fitness standards
00:12:35.60 --> 00:12:43.44 are universal across the Marine Corps and all the same. There is a unique level of fitness that
00:12:43.44 --> 00:12:47.44 is associated with flying and it kind of comes and goes with how much flying you're doing.
00:12:47.44 --> 00:12:51.60 But there's not like a separate type of aviation fitness other than there are things about
00:12:51.60 --> 00:12:56.000 aviation that will fatigue you that you won't get fatigue doing other things and that's two
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.04 for other things as well. But like the PT in the Marine Corps doesn't they don't care what your job is.
00:13:01.04 --> 00:13:08.24 Can you train for the, like, let's say you did a disassociated tour and you weren't flying
00:13:08.24 --> 00:13:13.36 for 18 months and now you knew you were going back to a squadron you were going to be flying.
00:13:13.36 --> 00:13:18.64 Is there any exercises that you could do to get ready for flying? You can't train for G
00:13:18.64 --> 00:13:24.48 tolerance. Exactly. So that's a perishable thing. You know, there's a, you know, a
00:13:24.48 --> 00:13:29.84 robegan anaerobic, there's certain muscles that are good to be strengthened. But if you have
00:13:29.84 --> 00:13:34.88 him phone, it's the Gs that will that you cannot train for. You can't replicate those Gs and
00:13:34.88 --> 00:13:39.52 you can't train for those Gs at all. Well, I mean, okay, let me challenge you. Now you can train
00:13:39.52 --> 00:13:45.36 for the technique and you can train to the muscles to do that, but you can't replicate the actual
00:13:45.36 --> 00:13:50.72 feeling of the Gs. But that being said, if you take someone that's in really good shape,
00:13:50.72 --> 00:13:54.24 versus someone that's not really good shape, the person that's in really good shape is going to do better.
00:13:54.24 --> 00:14:03.92 But maybe, I mean, okay, I mean, you have to use your muscles. Yeah, you do, but like larger
00:14:03.92 --> 00:14:12.32 muscles don't, don't mean better G tolerance. But what about just conditioning? Yeah, no, absolutely.
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:19.28 Yes, a better condition person is going to be able to endure all things being equal,
00:14:19.28 --> 00:14:22.40 be able to endure the rigors of flying more than the other person, but that doesn't mean he's
00:14:22.40 --> 00:14:28.64 going to have a higher G tolerance. Did I ever tell you about my buddy, what, what, when my
00:14:28.64 --> 00:14:34.80 platoons all went backseat in the F-18s? So we went through the whatever training you go through,
00:14:34.80 --> 00:14:40.40 so you can get called to go the backseat. So we all go through, well, he showed up late. And so he missed
00:14:40.40 --> 00:14:47.84 the whole briefing on how to, what is it called, how to push the blood to your brain? He missed all that,
00:14:47.84 --> 00:14:53.76 and then he missed whatever, and then he showed up, I think he was out. I think he was breaking the night before.
00:14:53.76 --> 00:14:57.60 And so there's a little covered move and like we snuck him back into the class and put his name on the
00:14:57.60 --> 00:15:03.68 roster and it's all good. Well, then he showed me, we get up to Fallen and he didn't know what to do. He just
00:15:03.68 --> 00:15:07.68 got in the plane. He's like, cool, I know what, you know, whatever. And he passed out the entire time.
00:15:07.68 --> 00:15:13.04 So he, he was just like wake up and then just pass out again because he didn't know to, to put the
00:15:13.04 --> 00:15:16.80 blood to his head. He didn't know to do that. So he just passed it out and they had video on it.
00:15:16.80 --> 00:15:20.48 Does that make sense that they had video of it? Totally. He was just, he was just flopping around the
00:15:20.48 --> 00:15:26.24 thing in the cockpit and we were laughing and he said, I had no idea. He just didn't remember anything.
00:15:26.24 --> 00:15:31.28 He was just passing out. Yep. Well, can she get like hurt like that? Like if you passed out
00:15:31.28 --> 00:15:36.48 Olympian, can't you neck? Because you know those that video that you play at the mustard that die
00:15:36.48 --> 00:15:42.16 in the what he would he called those diffusions. And he, he passes out and it's like probably
00:15:42.16 --> 00:15:47.12 still getting smashed from the force. Yeah. I don't think there's any real risk of
00:15:47.12 --> 00:15:53.76 pervangering from doing that. It's more just being humiliated. Yeah. Yeah. That's actually that's what
00:15:53.76 --> 00:15:57.36 I was that's what I meant like do you guys train? Do you guys have a specific like training or
00:15:57.36 --> 00:16:03.20 team for that? Because man, you don't really realize that I mean, maybe do, maybe don't. You don't
00:16:03.20 --> 00:16:07.36 but when you see guys flying planes and doing all that stuff, you don't really understand like what
00:16:07.36 --> 00:16:12.48 you're going through physically in there, you know, right? Is there an ideal physical build for
00:16:12.48 --> 00:16:18.32 fighter pilot? I don't think so, man. I mean, just like with every marine, there are all shapes and
00:16:18.32 --> 00:16:25.52 sizes. I mean, my body type is drastically different than others. And if you were going to be an
00:16:25.52 --> 00:16:31.92 F-18 pilot or let's say an F-35 pilot, you were going to design an F-35 pilot human. Yeah. How
00:16:31.92 --> 00:16:38.24 tall would that human be? Six foot. How much would they weigh? 190 pounds. So that's it. Does
00:16:38.24 --> 00:16:44.56 like, so there is an ideal. That's because if he's six four, he's cramped in the cockpit. If he's six,
00:16:44.56 --> 00:16:50.32 if he's five, five, he can't reach the pedal over there. Right? I mean, there's issues.
00:16:51.44 --> 00:16:57.04 There are there are legitimate anthropometric issues that is a truth. And like you get measured
00:16:57.04 --> 00:17:03.36 all these odd measurements like angled or like elbow to wrist, like angled to knee. There's all sorts of
00:17:03.60 --> 00:17:09.52 physical measurements. The window is pretty broad. And even, you know, for me to say six foot 190,
00:17:09.52 --> 00:17:16.08 I'm just talking about like a lean, strong guy. Does that mean a five foot six, a hundred and 25 pound
00:17:16.08 --> 00:17:20.88 person can't be good about? No, they totally absolutely can't. Absolutely can't. With that person,
00:17:20.88 --> 00:17:24.000 maybe struggle a little bit with like looking over the shore? Yeah. They wouldn't. They're by
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.68 type as if you're six four in your banging your head against the canopy, which guys in my
00:17:27.68 --> 00:17:32.16 squadron, guys whose call signs were stretch because they were so tall. At the end of the day,
00:17:32.16 --> 00:17:36.96 I don't think any would come back and say, I'm better because of my build or my height. So even that
00:17:36.96 --> 00:17:42.08 answer is like the window is broad enough to say then anybody and there's pilots out there,
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:46.000 that are pretty good pilots out there that aren't six foot 190. Is there a cut off?
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.08 Hi, or minimum technically? Yeah, I think it's pretty small. I think it's very short like
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:57.20 five one five two, you know, you can accommodate someone that short and I think I've known guys
00:17:57.20 --> 00:18:04.64 that are six five six six flying fighters. So dang, there's a big window in there. Do they call
00:18:04.64 --> 00:18:10.48 a pedals? They do. They call the pedals. Now they're adjustable. So the image of not being able
00:18:10.48 --> 00:18:17.36 to reach the pedals is more fun. But I'll tell you what, as a taller guy, a taller dude and
00:18:17.36 --> 00:18:20.56 there's, you know, when you get into an airplane that somebody else has flown and they're on
00:18:20.56 --> 00:18:24.56 the shorter side, you get in your, you're, you're, you know, it's like being in the back seat of a car
00:18:24.56 --> 00:18:28.000 and you immediately have to push those pedals all the way back because the dude in front of you is
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.16 way shorter than you. So it's adjustable like a cat-alact. It is. It's the adjustment is not too far away
00:18:34.16 --> 00:18:39.36 from the, the cockpit temperature adjuster. Oh, that's right. You know, you can adjust that
00:18:39.36 --> 00:18:45.60 temperature. Check. All right, going on. I do not wish to discourage anyone who gets exercise from
00:18:45.60 --> 00:18:50.88 golf tennis bowling hunting, fishing, gardening, walking skiing, etc. In fact, I encourage such
00:18:50.88 --> 00:18:57.20 activities during off time. When spring arrives in long daylight hours of the year with us, it's
00:18:57.20 --> 00:19:03.36 good time to start physical training program. He goes on. A commander should have no objection to
00:19:03.36 --> 00:19:08.08 to, to the closing of any headquarters at four o'clock two days a week in order to devote this
00:19:08.08 --> 00:19:15.52 time to physical exercising. Nor should he object to the stopping of other activities in most T O E units,
00:19:15.52 --> 00:19:21.28 at four o'clock two afternoons a week for this purpose. So he's talking about you should always
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:28.08 train two days a week, which once again, I mean, in the Marine Corps, you guys do PT every single day,
00:19:28.08 --> 00:19:35.04 right? Well, not aviation units. Oh, really? Yeah, I mean, when I was with the ground units,
00:19:35.04 --> 00:19:40.64 there was every single day and there was a time allocated to that. The squadrons that I would in,
00:19:40.64 --> 00:19:47.68 I was in, didn't do five day week, five day week PT. I thought that was pre-standard in the home military.
00:19:48.64 --> 00:19:52.56 Well, that's what he's saying. He's saying only two days a week. Yeah, I mean, I think what he's saying,
00:19:52.56 --> 00:19:56.000 it's interesting, because you mentioned the common, this guy was, you know, steeped in the world
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.24 or won. This is a guy saying you need to prioritize time for PT. Now, I mean, two days a week,
00:20:02.24 --> 00:20:06.40 now looking back as, you know, reflecting on that, but he was probably a pioneer saying,
00:20:06.40 --> 00:20:10.16 hey, commanders, shut your unit down to go work out. Yeah. And you should do that. Like,
00:20:10.16 --> 00:20:13.92 that's okay as opposed to, hey, we got to get this paperwork going or this,
00:20:13.92 --> 00:20:17.84 whatever other thing going on is so he might have been out in front of the curve for all I know
00:20:17.84 --> 00:20:21.84 for the, for the era that he was in saying, it's okay from the general down in the private,
00:20:21.84 --> 00:20:27.36 is it shut down normal ops to go to the unit. No, absolutely. I, you know, I believe you're 100%
00:20:27.36 --> 00:20:33.28 right? He was the guy that was spearheading working out. Look, you got to get out there two days
00:20:33.28 --> 00:20:38.64 a week. He doesn't even say minimum, right? Because that would be sort of like, hey,
00:20:38.64 --> 00:20:41.60 minimum two days a week. He's saying two days a week. You got to get out there.
00:20:43.68 --> 00:20:48.000 In connection with this physical exercise program, I think we might well give thought to delaying
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.32 the evening meal on Monday through Friday in order to give them more time to get cleaned up
00:20:52.32 --> 00:20:56.40 shallard and dress to the, they will not feel the or urge to rush right to work,
00:20:57.44 --> 00:21:02.72 well, right from work to supper. This was, this, at the reason I want to read the sections,
00:21:02.72 --> 00:21:07.36 this would have advantages other than physical conditioning by serving the evening meal in the
00:21:07.36 --> 00:21:13.92 enlisted messes as early as we do. We leave the soldier with over six hours of time after supper
00:21:13.92 --> 00:21:19.68 before he is scheduled to be in bed to do things that sometimes lead to trouble. More exercise
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:24.64 in a later meal hour in the afternoon would tend to reduce free time in the evening and would
00:21:24.64 --> 00:21:30.32 absorb energies and would encourage them to go to bed earlier. It has been found to be an overall
00:21:30.32 --> 00:21:35.36 advantage to serve the heavy meal at night instead of a noon on duty days. I believe we
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:40.40 give enough time off to our food service people so they can live with these changes in the feeding
00:21:40.40 --> 00:21:50.40 program. Oh, that's so classic. Alcohol, I've written before chapter three about the
00:21:50.40 --> 00:21:55.76 intent, use of alcohol and the end of the desire, ability of cutting down on the quantity of
00:21:55.76 --> 00:22:00.40 consumption of alcohol. One of the reasons for this is to help improve the physical condition
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:06.96 of our officers and men. Obesity, I would like to say a word about personnel being overweight,
00:22:06.96 --> 00:22:13.52 while they are not very many such personnel in most commands. There are some who are eating
00:22:13.52 --> 00:22:17.28 more than their physical activity burns up. The commander should bring this to the attention of
00:22:17.28 --> 00:22:25.92 such individuals with a view to more exercising or less eating or both other problems.
00:22:25.92 --> 00:22:33.04 This is the last section. Other problems. This is just a broad statement. This is something
00:22:33.04 --> 00:22:38.64 that echo that you used to say all the time on this podcast. Other problems, I believe that
00:22:38.64 --> 00:22:44.08 such a program as I suggested will automatically help to solve the problem in those units which
00:22:44.08 --> 00:22:49.36 have one of men and garrison changing out of fatigues for evening social activities. It should
00:22:49.36 --> 00:22:54.32 help reduce other unfavorable statistics as well. You used to say on this podcast all the time,
00:22:54.32 --> 00:23:03.68 echo that the most universally helpful thing that a person can do is exercise. It will help you
00:23:03.68 --> 00:23:10.16 in all aspects of whatever you're doing, which is a good point. What he said is, hey, if you exercise,
00:23:11.28 --> 00:23:19.04 every problem that you have is going to be improved. So echo is the pioneer on that one.
00:23:19.04 --> 00:23:23.92 There's something you said I was thinking about in my contrast between aviation, my time in a
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:29.60 fighter squadron versus my time in Anglicore, which is kind of the biggest contrast is, and I don't
00:23:29.60 --> 00:23:35.20 know how it is elsewhere, but the infantry or the ground units when I was with them have a kind of
00:23:35.20 --> 00:23:39.60 pre-regimen like their days and it's kind of a typical workday, whereas a fighter squadron operates
00:23:39.60 --> 00:23:45.68 24 hours a day. So they're running in shifts the whole time. So standard work week is there's always
00:23:45.68 --> 00:23:51.52 a third or a half of the unit there from Sunday night till Friday afternoon. So that cycle is a little,
00:23:51.52 --> 00:23:56.80 it's kind of thinking in my head just the getting the whole unit together and in this in a squadron
00:23:56.80 --> 00:24:01.28 almost never happens. You're at best you're going to have like even when you're doing your work up,
00:24:01.28 --> 00:24:06.72 you run in that work up is, work up is probably even worse because work ups, you know, the flying
00:24:06.72 --> 00:24:11.12 schedule shifts are on a bunch to get all these different calls, but you I would say routinely
00:24:11.12 --> 00:24:15.68 the best you're ever going to get is half your squadron there at any given time. Most of the time,
00:24:15.68 --> 00:24:21.68 not always like that, but I would say 90% of a typical fighter squadron cycle is you have two or three
00:24:21.68 --> 00:24:25.12 shifts and you'll never have more than half your squadron there at any given time.
00:24:26.48 --> 00:24:32.88 Well before the war in the 90s at the team, we used to PT as a team five days a week, as a team.
00:24:33.52 --> 00:24:38.32 Maybe one day would be what they call the individual PT, which guys would legitimately individual
00:24:38.32 --> 00:24:43.84 PT, they'd go do whatever, you know, do jits or whatever they were going to do. But the other days
00:24:43.84 --> 00:24:49.28 it was like, oh, Mondays are run, Tuesdays is swim, Wednesdays individual PT, Thursdays,
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:55.04 oh course, Friday's Monster Mash. That was kind of a typical schedule at the end of the
00:24:55.04 --> 00:25:01.28 back in the group. What's the Monster Mash is just, oh course, both paddle just come up with
00:25:01.28 --> 00:25:06.56 some crazy sort of various, what would you call it? I don't know what you, it'd be like one of those
00:25:06.56 --> 00:25:13.44 um, you ever see those TV physical competitions where they're doing all these up, like you'd run
00:25:13.44 --> 00:25:18.88 the obstacle course, then you would do berm runs, but you would be in a little team. So it'd just be
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:23.52 some kind of, we call it a Monster Mash. Like American Ninja Warrior? Yeah, like American Ninja Warrior,
00:25:23.52 --> 00:25:29.52 but as teams. Gotcha. And is the platoon back in the, this is obviously pre-war, but back in
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:34.24 was the platoon kind of together all the time. Yeah, so the platoon was together, but the team wasn't.
00:25:34.24 --> 00:25:38.40 So there'd be two platoons out in the desert. There'd be, no, there'd be one platoon out of the
00:25:38.40 --> 00:25:42.56 desert. There'd be one platoon up a foul and there'd be another platoon in the jungle somewhere,
00:25:42.56 --> 00:25:47.28 but there'd still be three platoons back at the team and all the support people from the team.
00:25:47.28 --> 00:25:52.32 So the platoon is like that was the element that at the lowest level, they were together. You
00:25:52.32 --> 00:25:56.40 didn't really break up platoon's very often. Not very often. That's cool. You're going through your work
00:25:56.40 --> 00:26:01.20 up together, but you gotta remember a seal platoon is small. Right. A seal platoon is only 16
00:26:01.20 --> 00:26:07.20 guys. Sometimes in the past, we bumped them up to 18. Sometimes we've even bumped them up to 21,
00:26:07.20 --> 00:26:15.60 depending on manning and personnel and mission, but the general seal platoon 16 people. And post, post
00:26:15.60 --> 00:26:20.88 war did that become the task unit was together for the most part, but they did almost like
00:26:20.88 --> 00:26:26.08 elevate up that they yes. Then they all the sudden they, they made the task unit, which is two
00:26:26.08 --> 00:26:31.12 platoons together with a headquarters unit over it. And they had the idea, it took them all
00:26:31.12 --> 00:26:36.64 a while to like actually make it happen. So there were some good vision on the bond behalf of
00:26:36.64 --> 00:26:43.12 naval special warfare commanders to say, actually, you know what, we should probably put a bigger unit
00:26:43.12 --> 00:26:49.68 together. Because 16 guys is very limiting. Right. What can you do with 16 guys? I mean, if you
00:26:49.68 --> 00:26:56.48 man up vehicles with 16 guys, you man up, whatever, you man up three vehicles. Now there's six people
00:26:56.48 --> 00:27:00.24 in those vehicles. Driver gunner, driver gunner, driver gunner, you put the rest of the guys in
00:27:00.24 --> 00:27:04.000 that that gives you 10 assaulters. What can you take down with 10 assaulters? The answer is not very many.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.36 So went into a task unit mode with now you had two platoons plus you had headquarters and then
00:27:09.36 --> 00:27:14.08 you get attachments of EOD and maybe you get a some kind of a radio man to help you out. So all
00:27:14.08 --> 00:27:20.88 of a sudden, you know, you got 35 or 40 guys going out the door. So it turns into a better situation.
00:27:20.88 --> 00:27:27.44 It's a really good call. I remember one of the, one of the first things I was in a platoon,
00:27:27.44 --> 00:27:31.76 I was in an org platoon, which meant we were going out on a ship and we had to do hydrographic
00:27:31.76 --> 00:27:36.96 reconnaissance, which is old school, lead line and slate. Lead line and slate meaning you had a
00:27:36.96 --> 00:27:43.20 lead line, you had a piece of rope with a piece of lead on the bottom and you you tied little knots
00:27:43.84 --> 00:27:49.12 every six feet for fathoms and you would go and swim in a line and dip that lead line and see how deep
00:27:49.12 --> 00:27:54.000 the water was and then you died for obstacles before the Marines came in. This is World War II straight
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.24 up UDT underwater demolition team stuff. Well, when you're in the org platoon, you actually did that a lot
00:28:00.24 --> 00:28:09.20 because you were supporting Marine Corps landings. So so we were, we had a 16 man platoon and I didn't
00:28:09.20 --> 00:28:13.68 an org like that with 16 guys and it was really hard because you have a, you have a boat party
00:28:13.68 --> 00:28:18.40 of guys and then you have like a radio man. So there's two or three guys that aren't in the water
00:28:18.40 --> 00:28:22.000 and somebody's staying with the boat. So there's another two guys that are not in the water. So all of a
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.36 sudden you've got you've only got seven guys to do the recon or nine guys to do the recon or whatever.
00:28:29.36 --> 00:28:36.56 So that's, that's not good. So I remember writing a point paper. I was like an E4 and I wrote a
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:43.12 point paper to my commanding officer that the org platoons should have four more personnel in the platoon.
00:28:43.68 --> 00:28:48.16 And I think we actually got like they gave us like two more guys. Pretty cool.
00:28:48.16 --> 00:28:56.000 So, I mean, who did I think I'm was such a, it's pretty funny. I look back at that.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000 I standard naval letter format when I'm sent to you. I know I try. Yeah. I know I tried, but the
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.60 cool thing was, you know, my commanding officer at the time was like, you know, that makes sense.
00:29:05.60 --> 00:29:10.72 Hey, we can't give you four, but we can give you two. Make it an 18 man platoon. We had an 18 man
00:29:10.72 --> 00:29:16.40 platoon. I'm pretty sure. I can't even remember. You know what's weird is, I can't even remember what
00:29:16.40 --> 00:29:22.72 yeah, I don't, I can't remember if he gave us two more people. Maybe give us one more. I think he gave
00:29:22.72 --> 00:29:29.04 us at least one more person because I think I know exactly who it was. But anyways, all right. So there's
00:29:29.04 --> 00:29:39.12 the physical conditioning thing. The next section is called chapter 12, the creating of superior units.
00:29:41.36 --> 00:29:45.68 Four basic principles. I have found that there are four basic principles which apply to the
00:29:45.68 --> 00:29:53.44 problem of creating army units which are considered superior. First, the superior unit must be
00:29:53.44 --> 00:30:01.92 created from the ordinary run of personnel. How awesome is that? You're going to make a superior
00:30:01.92 --> 00:30:07.68 unit. But anybody that's ever served in the military knows that you're going to get what you get.
00:30:09.68 --> 00:30:15.12 And yet we all know that there's units that are freaking awesome and there's units that are horrible.
00:30:15.12 --> 00:30:21.68 And both the awesome units and the horrible units have run of the mill people in them. They came from
00:30:21.68 --> 00:30:25.60 the, they come from the same pool of soldiers in this case. It's all the same people. You don't get
00:30:25.60 --> 00:30:32.16 to pick your little team of your superstar athletes in this case. And it's the same thing in business,
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:36.56 right? It's the same thing in business. You get businesses that are in the same market
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:44.48 and one of them is crushing and the other one's not. Well, why is that? Why is that? You're both
00:30:44.48 --> 00:30:49.28 getting to hire from the same group of human beings in the country, whatever country you're in.
00:30:50.24 --> 00:30:56.000 So the superior unit must be created from the ordinary run of personnel second, classified according
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.88 to ability, the men in a unit fall naturally into three groupings, upper, middle and lower. The
00:31:02.88 --> 00:31:08.24 excellence of a unit depends upon the ability of the commander to bring the men of the lower group to a
00:31:08.24 --> 00:31:14.24 degree of proficiency which makes them an asset to his unit team. So this is we're going to
00:31:14.24 --> 00:31:22.32 get a some stuff where I'm, I'm not sure about. I'm not sure about this is one of them. And he talks
00:31:22.32 --> 00:31:26.24 about a little bit more. I mean, he talks about your focus being making the people that are,
00:31:26.56 --> 00:31:30.40 he's basically saying you got a really good people, middle people and bad people. He's saying
00:31:30.40 --> 00:31:36.000 the focus is like, make the bad people better, make the bad people a, a, a, a plus for the unit.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:44.16 I don't necessarily agree with that. I agree with that, should be a focus, a singular focus,
00:31:44.16 --> 00:31:48.40 I don't think it should be the full. I would rather take my people to the top and make them totally
00:31:48.40 --> 00:31:54.16 awesome and make my people that are in the middle like really, really good. I'm not going to focus
00:31:54.16 --> 00:32:01.36 my efforts on the turds. The reason I didn't say anything when you, when you read that, because I had
00:32:01.36 --> 00:32:07.44 a little like, is I'm going to listen what General Clark has to say before I get to me, but that
00:32:07.44 --> 00:32:12.72 at, on its face, though, when you said that, my first thing was was, oh, okay, I don't think that's
00:32:12.72 --> 00:32:18.000 right, but I'm, obviously he's going to say something about it, but we get this question and business
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.76 all the time. Is, is they, leaders will devote all their attention to their bottom performers,
00:32:21.76 --> 00:32:27.44 like almost all their attention. It's like, why would you invest all of your time in your least
00:32:27.44 --> 00:32:32.32 productive people? Why wouldn't you invest most of your, most of your time in your most productive
00:32:32.32 --> 00:32:36.56 people? I get, you don't, you don't ignore those people, but if you're devoting, and again,
00:32:36.56 --> 00:32:41.04 let, he's going to say something. I'm sure. But when you said that, I had that reaction of,
00:32:41.04 --> 00:32:48.72 well, it's like if you, let's say, on a level of 1 to 5, you're a 5, and echo is a 1.
00:32:50.48 --> 00:32:56.24 1 being the worst 5 being the best. So if I take my efforts, and I'm able to,
00:32:58.08 --> 00:33:03.76 I'm able to double your power, I can turn you into a 10, I can only turn echo into a 2.
00:33:03.76 --> 00:33:13.84 2 exponentially positive returns on Dave Burke. Kind of not. All right, next. Third,
00:33:13.84 --> 00:33:21.76 all men that does, this is such, this is such an interesting one. Third, all men desire to do
00:33:21.76 --> 00:33:31.20 what is wanted of them. All men desire to do what is wanted of them. Okay, so that's the first
00:33:31.20 --> 00:33:37.60 part. So let's, let's absorb that, and then he goes on to just take some ownership here,
00:33:37.60 --> 00:33:44.32 when they do not, it is because they have not been adequately motivated and instructed.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.48 So have you ever had anybody in your squadron that straight up just didn't want to do what was,
00:33:54.48 --> 00:34:02.24 what was wanted of them? You know, I would say yes in the sense that, yeah, there are people
00:34:02.24 --> 00:34:09.36 that I've had in my units that fit that bill, and we did something about that. His point, I understand
00:34:09.36 --> 00:34:14.24 his point though, and the idea that I'm going to write that person office unwilling to do it,
00:34:16.08 --> 00:34:22.32 to me, it was more like, how much of my, how much energy am I going to devote to try to find the
00:34:22.32 --> 00:34:28.64 way that gets you to our need to be? So while I don't disagree with that comment, yeah, I've
00:34:28.64 --> 00:34:34.48 had people in my, in my sphere, multiple times throughout my career that simply didn't get what
00:34:34.48 --> 00:34:40.56 they needed to be. And could you say, hey, that's sort of a fault of leader? Yes, 100%. But the leader
00:34:40.56 --> 00:34:44.24 also still has to make a little measurement of, am I going to devote 100% of my time to getting
00:34:44.24 --> 00:34:48.88 that guy from a one, two, a two? Remember to go, hey man, this investment in you right now is going
00:34:48.88 --> 00:34:52.88 to take away from all this other stuff, and I'm going to cut you loose. Yeah, and by the way, what's what's
00:34:52.88 --> 00:35:01.52 10 times zero? Yeah, if the person's a zero, well now, so listen, I think all men is an overstatement.
00:35:02.16 --> 00:35:09.04 I think you could throw a percentage on there. That's upwards of 97%. Yeah, 97% that want to
00:35:10.24 --> 00:35:18.32 want, they want to do a good job. They want to do a good job. And to his point, as a leader, your default
00:35:18.32 --> 00:35:22.40 should be, is that they're not the problem. Your default to be is the percentage is so high that
00:35:22.40 --> 00:35:28.16 you might as well just go in the assumption that the problem isn't with them. So that 97% is,
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:33.20 I think actually correct not all, but I think it's point two is like, hey, if you're in charge of
00:35:33.20 --> 00:35:37.44 people and they're not, they're not up to standards, you need to spend most of your time
00:35:37.44 --> 00:35:41.12 figuring out what you're doing wrong. Yeah, most people don't need to be fired that need to be
00:35:41.12 --> 00:35:45.52 led. I think we wrote that in extreme ownership or in dichotomy leadership. I think it's in
00:35:45.52 --> 00:35:49.44 dichotomy leadership. Most people don't need to be fired. They need to be led. Most people. Yeah.
00:35:49.44 --> 00:35:53.92 All people? No, you're going to get, and you know when you see this, and I don't,
00:35:53.92 --> 00:35:59.76 well, you didn't get to see this because you were an officer, then you went through OCS. When you go
00:35:59.76 --> 00:36:05.76 through like Navy Bootcamp, you see some people that don't want to be there. They do not want to
00:36:05.76 --> 00:36:09.28 be there. They're there for 15 minutes. Like this ain't for me. And they're going to do whatever
00:36:09.28 --> 00:36:15.36 they got to do to get, they don't want to do what is wanted of them. They don't. Yeah. They want out.
00:36:16.08 --> 00:36:22.64 Fourth, the best unit in an organization is always the one which is excellent or better in all things.
00:36:24.40 --> 00:36:29.20 If you agree with these precepts, let us analyze and apply them to the basic problem of the
00:36:29.20 --> 00:36:34.24 commander who is striving for a superior unit. Application to the units, applications of the principal
00:36:34.24 --> 00:36:40.08 student. The problems of polishing ordinary units until they emerge a superior are primarily the
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:45.04 problems of raising individual performance and capabilities to a superior level. The many truly
00:36:45.04 --> 00:36:50.16 outstanding units which have been produced in our army, giving, giving ample evidence that these
00:36:50.16 --> 00:36:59.44 problems can be solved. Based on the fact that they're percentile scores on the AFQT, which is
00:36:59.44 --> 00:37:05.44 like the AzVab, which is the basic intelligence test that you take when you're coming in the military,
00:37:05.44 --> 00:37:09.68 as in the list of guys. Do you take it to become an officer? Yeah. No, no, take it. Take the AzVab.
00:37:09.68 --> 00:37:18.32 Yes, absolutely. Okay. So you take like a basic test. It's sort of an SAT and ACT type test.
00:37:18.32 --> 00:37:22.72 Totally. How smart are you? It's basically what it is. And then he ranks it out in three groups.
00:37:23.84 --> 00:37:28.96 And it's the upper third, the middle third, the lower third. But he's got this little thing in here.
00:37:28.96 --> 00:37:35.44 And he's got the scores listed and I'm not going to go into those. But the upper third is
00:37:36.40 --> 00:37:44.24 11 percent and 34. So the upper, the top two groups combined, make up 45 percent. So 45
00:37:44.24 --> 00:37:52.40 percent of people are in the 65 percentile and higher of that testing. 43 percent are in the middle.
00:37:52.40 --> 00:37:57.44 So you're almost done. And then the last 12 percent is people that are in not below a group,
00:37:57.44 --> 00:38:01.92 but the second of the lowest group. So if you get between 0 and 9 on the on the AzVab,
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:07.52 and these aren't, this is actually the AFQT, which is the old AzVab. So the scores won't correlate
00:38:07.52 --> 00:38:12.88 to what we know about since we didn't take the AzVab in 19th. We can take the AFQT in 1958.
00:38:14.16 --> 00:38:19.44 So what he's saying is you're going to get mostly people that are either in the middle group
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.52 or in the higher group, which is great. Now I'm sure that there's some people that are
00:38:23.52 --> 00:38:27.44 think, wow, that's the difference. You know, I'm in the civilian world and we get these people.
00:38:27.44 --> 00:38:34.96 They're, they're not, no. When you start talking about people that are in the lowest scoring
00:38:34.96 --> 00:38:40.88 brackets of the, of the AzVab, like they can't get in the military, but they're also not going to be
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.92 applying for a job with that's going to take some some high level cognitive abilities.
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:52.40 They're, they're just not going to be there. So I've got a very interesting book that I'm going to
00:38:52.40 --> 00:38:59.44 cover on the podcast and, and it's, it's really, it's, I've been reading it for a while. I've actually
00:38:59.44 --> 00:39:02.80 actually actually showed it to you several months ago because I've been stewing on it, but
00:39:03.92 --> 00:39:10.96 it's during the Vietnam War, they, they needed people. They needed people,
00:39:12.48 --> 00:39:17.60 to be in the military. They needed people to be in the military to go to Vietnam. And so they
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:24.24 started to lower the standards and the main standard that they lowered was the, the IQ level,
00:39:24.24 --> 00:39:27.52 or I don't know if you want to call it the IQ level, but that's basically what's the intellectual
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:34.32 level, the, the, the intelligence level. And they started getting these, these people in the military
00:39:34.32 --> 00:39:43.04 that were just, they just didn't have the mental capacity to, to do really any job.
00:39:43.04 --> 00:39:48.48 Um, even, and you know, you know, you think about in the military, there's some pretty,
00:39:48.48 --> 00:39:52.72 there's some jobs that don't take a lot of intellectual horsepower, right? I mean,
00:39:52.72 --> 00:39:57.52 you need people that are going to clean the, the toilets, you know, you got, you got some, you know,
00:39:57.52 --> 00:40:01.68 you got a people that are going to, and look, these are what we, this is what I did when I got
00:40:01.68 --> 00:40:05.20 the military, right? When I got the seal teams, I was cleaning toilets, but then you, you're,
00:40:05.20 --> 00:40:08.88 you're going to move up and you're going to move on, but at some place you need some people that
00:40:08.88 --> 00:40:17.52 are going to have some pretty fundamentally non-high cognitive skill requirement jobs.
00:40:19.04 --> 00:40:22.48 Well, they started letting people in that this didn't have the capability. It's a really sad,
00:40:22.48 --> 00:40:26.40 and these guys, a lot of these guys went to Vietnam. They had, obviously, that higher casualty rate,
00:40:26.40 --> 00:40:32.40 that higher, more of them got killed, because they just didn't, they just didn't understand things.
00:40:32.40 --> 00:40:36.40 And the guy that wrote this book that I'm reading, he went, he's talking about going through bootcamp.
00:40:36.40 --> 00:40:41.28 And he basically gets paired up with one of these guys, and all the drone structures knew it.
00:40:42.16 --> 00:40:46.80 They called him like McNamara's morons. That's what they'd call these guys when they'd come in.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.40 And he got assigned one of these guys basically to, to help get him through bootcamp. And one of the
00:40:54.40 --> 00:41:01.20 most, like one of the opening scenes is they're telling him, hey, you know, right, right your address
00:41:01.20 --> 00:41:07.44 on this postcard and write a message to your family. And not only did he not know how to write,
00:41:07.44 --> 00:41:12.48 but he didn't even know what his address was. He didn't even know what his, what street he lived on.
00:41:12.48 --> 00:41:17.12 It didn't, he didn't know that it teach him how to tie his shoes. And they had to teach him how to
00:41:17.12 --> 00:41:21.04 tie his shoes, not just hey, this is how you do it. No, like, they had to teach him
00:41:21.76 --> 00:41:28.56 for extended periods of time how to tie his shoes. So these are people that are really in a,
00:41:28.56 --> 00:41:34.80 really, you know, in a low intellectual level. And we brought, I think, was about a hundred
00:41:34.80 --> 00:41:39.60 thousand of them into the military, which is just uns, just horrible, just horrible.
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:47.60 So my point in saying all that is we're talking about, you know, in this civilian sector,
00:41:48.40 --> 00:41:52.56 you're not getting that person either to apply for your job in accounting, right? So don't think
00:41:52.56 --> 00:41:56.64 to yourself, well, you know, my accounting department, they're my guys, my people are,
00:41:56.64 --> 00:42:01.04 they're, they're not smart either. No one I talking about that. We're not talking about that.
00:42:03.60 --> 00:42:10.08 So he goes on to say that those in the upper groupings are the best educated and quick
00:42:10.08 --> 00:42:15.44 as to learn, can be well motivated, but need to be challenged to develop their full potential.
00:42:15.44 --> 00:42:19.68 The middle groupings are average run of American use. They're easily controlled.
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:25.20 They're both take well the discipline, learn easily, respond to good leadership, but are usually
00:42:25.20 --> 00:42:31.76 capable of more than and they must be pushed. The lower groupings are the ones that need special attention.
00:42:31.76 --> 00:42:35.92 And again, this is where you and I are kind of like, hmm, the lower groupings are the ones who need
00:42:35.92 --> 00:42:40.48 special attention. The disciplinary problem in this group is higher than average. I agree with that.
00:42:40.48 --> 00:42:45.52 The individuals require special motivation instruction. I agree with that. They're attitude,
00:42:45.52 --> 00:42:53.04 constitutes a special barometer of the spread of core of the unit. This group contains also
00:42:53.04 --> 00:42:58.64 many of the misfits who, if they cannot be assimilated, must be eliminated.
00:42:59.92 --> 00:43:06.80 So it's interesting that he's calling for like special attention on this lower group.
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:14.08 And then he says in a single squad, crew, go, well, I'm just, I'm thinking in my mind as I'm
00:43:14.08 --> 00:43:17.68 hearing you talk about this. Just things that I've heard you say on this podcast, things we've
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:23.76 talked about on your podcast. And I'm trying to kind of consider what's in general,
00:43:23.76 --> 00:43:26.40 Clark's head as I'm hearing this. Obviously, I'm trying to put myself in his position.
00:43:27.12 --> 00:43:32.16 We've talked about this before and I think the way you said it was anybody on your team
00:43:32.96 --> 00:43:39.12 has the potential to undo your entire plan. And so I'm trying to make this connection
00:43:39.12 --> 00:43:43.12 ahead of the things he's talking about, why you devote so much effort to these people. And I'm
00:43:43.12 --> 00:43:49.20 just trying to place them out of why he's saying it the way he's saying it, which there is,
00:43:49.20 --> 00:43:51.84 if they're on your team and you keep them on your team, these aren't people you get rid of,
00:43:51.84 --> 00:43:55.12 but they're on your team and they are under performers, a little performance. They still have the
00:43:55.12 --> 00:44:00.40 potential of undoing your plan. And so I'm trying to piece the things that he's thinking,
00:44:00.40 --> 00:44:05.28 almost, I don't know what he's going to say, but I do understand that. You know, the flip side of
00:44:05.28 --> 00:44:08.80 that, the other thing I've been thinking about, we work with companies that some of the companies
00:44:08.80 --> 00:44:13.44 we work with, how this philosophy is, hey, we're going to pay more. And we're going to track to higher,
00:44:14.48 --> 00:44:20.24 higher bar, a higher average level because we are a higher paying organization. So we're going to,
00:44:20.24 --> 00:44:23.52 and there's a bunch of economic theory behind that. And their belief is that they're going to
00:44:23.52 --> 00:44:28.72 track better talent. And you know what they end up with? The exact same problems is all other organizations.
00:44:28.72 --> 00:44:32.56 They still have a bell curve. They still have under performers. And this is something you said too,
00:44:32.56 --> 00:44:36.96 is even in the sealed teams and people create this image on their mind of what a seal is and
00:44:36.96 --> 00:44:42.000 they're, you know, the superhuman. And how many times have you said no, they're people,
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.08 the exact same thing at Top Gun where people place these guys on a pedestal. If they're
00:44:46.80 --> 00:44:55.12 somehow all of them uniquely capable, we had a bottom 12% at Top Gun 2. We had under performers
00:44:55.12 --> 00:45:00.72 at Top Gun just like everyone else. So for me to think about it, if you're in a leadership role,
00:45:00.72 --> 00:45:07.44 the takeaway from this is that what is required for all this is your leadership more than anything.
00:45:07.44 --> 00:45:13.12 Now, I do want to hear his thoughts on that, but your under performance can still undo your plan.
00:45:13.12 --> 00:45:16.32 And there's no like free pass of, hey, we just have a better screening process. We don't
00:45:16.32 --> 00:45:21.76 weed out those people. We know that that's not true. Those problems exist in the same bell
00:45:21.76 --> 00:45:27.92 curve in any, every organization. Yeah. And the other thing that affects the bell curve is the bar
00:45:27.92 --> 00:45:35.60 that everyone has to be staying above. So the bottom 12% at Top Gun, they're the bottom,
00:45:35.60 --> 00:45:41.84 tell a percent of Top Gun, they may be the top tier of some other organization somewhere,
00:45:42.40 --> 00:45:48.64 but at Top Gun they're the bottom 12% and they're making the same kind of mistakes relative
00:45:48.64 --> 00:45:53.68 to their job. It's the same thing in the seal teams like, oh yeah, the the seal teams, they have
00:45:53.68 --> 00:45:59.36 a, we have a bottom part of the bell curve. Now, those people might be really good if they had
00:45:59.36 --> 00:46:05.28 some other jobs somewhere. You know, in Task Unit, Bruce, we had to get rid of one guy. It was a
00:46:05.28 --> 00:46:09.92 great guy. He was a hard worker. He just didn't quite have the capacity to get the job done.
00:46:10.48 --> 00:46:15.92 I guarantee he went to his next unit in the Navy and was the best sailor they had. I can, I can, I can
00:46:15.92 --> 00:46:22.88 guarantee that because he was a hard worker. He wanted to do a good job. He just didn't quite have
00:46:22.88 --> 00:46:27.28 that decision-making process. And maybe I shouldn't have said the best sailor, but he's going to be
00:46:27.28 --> 00:46:36.32 a really good guy, a really good guy. And so, but the bar is higher for what you're being required
00:46:36.32 --> 00:46:42.40 to do. Right? This is what you're like a top gun. You're being required to fly this jet at these
00:46:43.20 --> 00:46:48.80 at these G's and make these decisions and maneuver and remember what's happening and debrief
00:46:48.80 --> 00:46:52.24 and communicate and pay attention to nine different things at the same time. You're required to do
00:46:52.24 --> 00:46:58.40 all that stuff. And the people that are barely able to do it, they're the bottom of the bell curve.
00:46:59.04 --> 00:47:04.72 You put them, you know, driving an Uber and they're going to be the best freaking Uber driver.
00:47:04.72 --> 00:47:09.36 You know, in, well, at least in the top, let's say the top 5% of Uber driver because I've had
00:47:09.36 --> 00:47:16.48 some damn good Uber drivers before. So, so, yes, that bell curve exists everywhere. You're not going
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:25.12 to get away from it and you do have to lead. And I agree with your point. Why general clerk might
00:47:25.12 --> 00:47:32.48 be saying, hey, you're going to pay attention to that bottom 12% because no one in the top
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:42.72 88% is going to, well, there's a much less chance of them torpedoing your whole mission. Right?
00:47:42.72 --> 00:47:48.24 Those knuckleheads, they're holding the freaking trigger to the torpedo and they could fire that
00:47:48.24 --> 00:47:53.92 thing off at any moment. So, you got to pay attention to them. That might be the, the, the genesis of
00:47:53.92 --> 00:48:01.20 his, of his focus on these individuals. That probably where the, what's the thing? You're only
00:48:01.20 --> 00:48:06.32 as strong as your weakest link kind of. Yeah. The loss of your head. Yep. Yeah. Maybe that's where
00:48:06.32 --> 00:48:14.16 it came from. It's, it's from that, definitely from that concept that broad concept. Yeah. He goes on
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:18.64 here. Single squad crew or section will probably contain men of all three groupings. Certainly,
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:22.64 they will appear in any platoon or company. This presents a practical problem in the handling and
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.24 instructing of men in, in perfecting the teamwork of the squad crew, second or platoon. The leader
00:48:28.24 --> 00:48:36.08 can afford to adopt only one approach to handling his men. He must assume that they all want to
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:43.60 do what he wants done. When any number do not respond to this assumption, the fault is more
00:48:43.60 --> 00:48:49.36 probably his than theirs. So, his assumption is everyone wants to, that's a greatest assumption to
00:48:49.36 --> 00:48:53.44 make. The assumption and that's what I like about this assumption that all men want to do what
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:58.000 what is wanted them to do, what, what we want them to do. That's a great assumption to make because
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.44 that means when they don't, it's our fault. And that's exactly what he's saying. He's taking full
00:49:01.44 --> 00:49:05.04 ownership. And then he says, this is like, oh, what's word for word for something that I
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:11.12 brief on. What is on a daily basis to companies? If they don't respond, he should check his procedures,
00:49:11.12 --> 00:49:17.04 instructions, and subordinate leaders to determine where in lies the trouble. When only one or two
00:49:17.04 --> 00:49:22.40 individuals are involved, punitive action or elimination, maybe an indicated. So, if you got a platoon
00:49:22.40 --> 00:49:26.40 or a company, you got a company of 150 people and everyone gets it except for two guys. Okay.
00:49:26.40 --> 00:49:31.60 Well, maybe I need to check those two guys and maybe I need to get rid of them. But if you've got
00:49:31.60 --> 00:49:36.08 whatever, 20 people that don't understand what they're supposed to be doing, guess what? It's on you.
00:49:39.12 --> 00:49:44.56 We arrive now at the fourth precept, the best union in the organization. Always the one which
00:49:44.56 --> 00:49:48.40 is excellent or better than all things, which is based upon the premise that no unit commander has
00:49:48.40 --> 00:49:55.76 enough time to make his unit superior in all things at all times. How therefore should he spread
00:49:55.76 --> 00:50:00.08 his efforts? It's obvious that his unit must be proficient in marksmanship, communication,
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:04.48 supply administration, tactics, physical fitness techniques, maintenance, etc, etc, etc.
00:50:04.48 --> 00:50:10.64 If his unit is not proficient in any one of these things, his team is not sound and will fail him
00:50:10.64 --> 00:50:16.88 when the test comes. How then must he manage? So, we got all these things and you obviously can't
00:50:16.88 --> 00:50:26.08 be, and he's making a difference or making a break between superior, which means you're
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:33.44 awesome at this thing and being good at it. First, he should avoid putting too much stress on any
00:50:33.44 --> 00:50:40.000 one thing, so as to overemphasize it in order to make a show of it. If he practices this method,
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.36 he will do so at the expense of other important things. This is a commoner. So, you shouldn't be the
00:50:45.36 --> 00:50:51.52 master of anything you should be the jack of all trades. Second, he must stress adequately all of the
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:57.28 many facets of the training job. Even though he is not an expert in each, he must direct a
00:50:57.28 --> 00:51:02.56 subordinate to be an expert and the commander must then supervise and check his subordinate's work.
00:51:02.56 --> 00:51:06.32 The latter is important. So, you're not going to be an expert as the leader, not going to be expert.
00:51:06.32 --> 00:51:10.16 You got some nugs under you that are going to be the expert, nothing.
00:51:13.12 --> 00:51:18.32 Next section is called motivation. Wovement into the entire pattern are the threads of motivation.
00:51:18.32 --> 00:51:21.92 This motivation is manifestly important because it comes from a spree enthusiasm,
00:51:21.92 --> 00:51:27.36 a route, effort, competition, and accomplishment. The people in each of the top middle and lower
00:51:27.36 --> 00:51:32.08 groupings need to be motivated in different ways and in varying degrees, which is a little different
00:51:32.08 --> 00:51:35.52 than when he said earlier, says the leader can only afford to adopt the one approach when
00:51:35.52 --> 00:51:41.68 handling his men. Little, little dichotomy. You got different people that are going to get motivated
00:51:41.68 --> 00:51:47.52 in different ways. In encouraging students to learn, we motivate them by one or more of the following.
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:55.04 One, show a need to develop and interest both those are explaining why. This is why this is
00:51:55.04 --> 00:51:58.88 important. That's what the need is. Here's how you get someone to develop and interest and
00:51:58.88 --> 00:52:04.08 something you explain to them how it's going to help that. Maintain the interest. That's also
00:52:04.08 --> 00:52:08.40 explaining why. Then he's got some other things encouraging or really success, giving recognition
00:52:08.40 --> 00:52:13.20 and credit, using competition, giving rewards, awarding punishments. These same things
00:52:13.20 --> 00:52:18.72 may be used to incite a body of mentor military unit into action. Undoubtedly, every commander,
00:52:18.72 --> 00:52:24.000 sometime during his career, after being assigned a difficult task, has soon, soon thereafter,
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.96 considered how he would present this task to his subordinates, how he would appeal them to get the
00:52:28.96 --> 00:52:36.40 job done. In short, on what he would base his efforts to motivate them to tackle the job with the
00:52:36.40 --> 00:52:44.000 will necessary to attain the goal sought. He will probably use many factors to motivate his unit.
00:52:44.64 --> 00:52:49.84 Some of them may be specifically mentioned and some may be implied, for instance, except as a
00:52:49.84 --> 00:52:55.68 last resort. He would not mention punishment in this case of failure. His men would know him well enough
00:52:55.68 --> 00:53:00.96 to know that he would not stand for failure. The real art in motivating a group of men to accomplish
00:53:00.96 --> 00:53:06.96 a common mission is to reach each man in such a way that all men in the unit are incited to the extent
00:53:06.96 --> 00:53:12.56 of their several capabilities. Of course, the kind of mission to be performed by the men will be
00:53:12.56 --> 00:53:17.60 will determine the motivating factors used, but there is one element that must be kept in mind.
00:53:17.60 --> 00:53:23.20 And that is that no amount of motivation will incite to man to undertake,
00:53:23.20 --> 00:53:32.08 and that is what he knows is manifestly beyond his capabilities. So big chunk about motivation
00:53:32.08 --> 00:53:38.16 there. I was talking, I can't remember who is the client or if he was the EF online the other
00:53:38.16 --> 00:53:47.68 day. But when you get told the proverbial, you get tasked with something that doesn't make any sense
00:53:47.68 --> 00:53:51.28 and the boss just says, shut up and have your team do it. What do you do? How do you
00:53:51.28 --> 00:53:57.92 handle that? What do you say to the troops? And I'm like, I will find a reason why all day long
00:53:57.92 --> 00:54:02.56 that is awesome. You know, I will go, and I'm not going to go, I don't. I'm going to say, hey, listen,
00:54:02.56 --> 00:54:05.04 boss just told us this is how we're doing it. And you know, we're going to do, we're going to
00:54:05.04 --> 00:54:09.68 knock this thing out of the park. That way, I'm going to build some trust with a boss. He's going to
00:54:09.68 --> 00:54:13.04 realize that we can get the job done. When he realized that we can get the job done, he's going to
00:54:13.04 --> 00:54:17.68 start to listen me. Once he starts to listen to me, I'm going to get this changed. So right now,
00:54:17.68 --> 00:54:22.72 we're going to crush this thing and the guys go, yes, or I'm going to say, hey, look, no,
00:54:22.72 --> 00:54:27.20 I'll just be able to do this. Where the only people that can get this done, the boss knows it.
00:54:27.20 --> 00:54:32.000 We know it. So we're going to knock this thing out of the park. Like, I'm going to figure out a reason
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.36 there's got to be a reason why that makes sense to do this thing. And believe me, if I can't
00:54:37.36 --> 00:54:42.64 find a reason to work it and told to do something that makes no sense whatsoever is going to get
00:54:42.64 --> 00:54:50.72 people unnecessarily gounded or killed or it's unethical or it's immoral or it's illegal. That's what's
00:54:50.72 --> 00:54:55.20 going on. Otherwise, I can figure out a reason. And I'm talking about a good, I'm not talking
00:54:55.20 --> 00:54:59.52 about making something up to trick people. I'm talking about I will figure out a good, freaking
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:05.20 reason to go forward to make this happen. And that's what you need to do as a boss. That's that's why
00:55:05.20 --> 00:55:17.36 the Y is so important. Talks about awards in the army. We use freely a system of awards and
00:55:17.36 --> 00:55:23.12 prizes in order to motivate men to often these go to the men in the top of the upper group.
00:55:24.72 --> 00:55:29.92 They provide no incentive for improvement to those in the lower group and little for those in the
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:35.28 middle group because the men know that the award is beyond their ability to achieve these prizes
00:55:35.28 --> 00:55:39.84 make good articles for the unit papers, but they're overall effectively unit is negligible.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.96 It is well to recognize the outstanding men and we do this through proficiency pay and promotion.
00:55:50.64 --> 00:55:56.96 However, our system awards must go beyond this recognition of individuals. This is a great point.
00:55:56.96 --> 00:56:00.96 You know, so often we're sitting there rewarding the people that are doing well.
00:56:01.76 --> 00:56:07.04 Who actually probably don't need any additional motivation. Look, should we recognize them? Absolutely.
00:56:07.84 --> 00:56:11.92 But what are we doing for the middle group and even the lower group to make sure that they're
00:56:12.72 --> 00:56:14.96 feeling like they're moving forward in a positive way?
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:20.40 Yeah, you know, when you're like in elementary school and you have like the award for most
00:56:20.40 --> 00:56:24.72 improved, that's like kind of alleviates that issue, right? A little bit.
00:56:24.72 --> 00:56:29.44 Because usually it's like someone in the middle, maybe even the bottom, a lot of the times when you
00:56:29.44 --> 00:56:34.88 still get that cool like trophy or whatever, because you improved so much. Is that right?
00:56:34.88 --> 00:56:40.96 A little backhanded smack though. I guess you rack up some most improved.
00:56:42.56 --> 00:56:48.08 I've gotten every four years. No, I don't think it is though. I don't think it is a backhanded thing
00:56:48.08 --> 00:56:52.88 because it's true. Like, you know, when you get like, you know, MVP of the football game,
00:56:52.88 --> 00:56:58.08 it's always the same guy, the quarterback, whatever the guy in, you know, you obviously depends on
00:56:58.08 --> 00:57:02.48 the game. But it's like, that's why he's already training, by the way. And he's already talented and
00:57:02.48 --> 00:57:09.44 gifted and he's working hard and he's focused. Yeah. And the word, the guys in the middle, you do
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:13.84 run that risk big time, where it's like the guys in the middle is like, oh yeah, well, I don't even
00:57:13.84 --> 00:57:19.68 have an expectation of the award, you know, but if you get, if you get most improved,
00:57:19.68 --> 00:57:23.92 but you can get most improved. That's good. You know, especially if everyone respects it,
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:28.16 because everyone typically does respect that if you're improving. I had, there's something called
00:57:28.16 --> 00:57:33.28 the Navy achievement medal. Did you ever get Navy achievement medal? So Navy achievement medal is like,
00:57:33.28 --> 00:57:38.32 you know, it's sort of like, it's a, it's a strong pat on the back. Well, say, and you know,
00:57:38.32 --> 00:57:43.04 you might get one with something happens. You know, you're a young and list of guys. I think I had
00:57:43.04 --> 00:57:47.92 six Navy achievement medals, which is totally ridiculous. I would get those things all the time for
00:57:47.92 --> 00:57:53.20 like, what's it for? Like, oh, I would run a communications course. When these are all from the 90s,
00:57:53.20 --> 00:57:57.20 it'd be like, you know, petty officer willing ran an outstanding, you know, good,
00:57:57.20 --> 00:58:01.92 communications course. He organized, led and developed the Bob of a bot. Nam. Stoner used to
00:58:01.92 --> 00:58:06.88 like laugh every time I put my dress uniform on because I had five Navy achievement medals.
00:58:06.88 --> 00:58:14.40 I'm like the big rack of stars across my Navy across my NAMS. Get some. Yeah. But I
00:58:14.40 --> 00:58:19.44 feel like, I know, but I feel like I was kind of that guy. Like, I was working hard and they were just
00:58:19.44 --> 00:58:24.48 giving me awards and I was like, cool, whatever. I don't care. I didn't care at all. Yeah. I wasn't like,
00:58:25.76 --> 00:58:31.12 check out my NAMS. Well, then, okay, then I guess if you kind of go into it, I mean,
00:58:31.12 --> 00:58:35.20 in all kinds of environments, right? There's all kinds of different awards like that that are
00:58:35.20 --> 00:58:40.24 that are, you can get without being the top like producer, whatever. Like, you got,
00:58:40.24 --> 00:58:44.16 okay, you got most improved, then you got like hardest worker or something like that, you know,
00:58:44.16 --> 00:58:49.60 how you never get that one? No. Okay, I was not a sales. As far as like expectations of metal,
00:58:49.60 --> 00:58:55.20 that one was on in every release. But, but you get those. How many NAMS do you have Dave?
00:58:55.20 --> 00:59:00.64 One. What did you get to them? I got an end of tour NAMS. Dang. So when was this when you were
00:59:00.64 --> 00:59:07.12 like an incident or a, yeah, first tour, yeah, first tour in a squadron. So as you're thinking,
00:59:07.12 --> 00:59:11.36 I was laughing because you know, when you're talking about even the way you're saying NAM like anybody
00:59:11.36 --> 00:59:18.16 in the NAMS, the NAMS is like this thing. This NAMS team of metal is like an irractive five of those.
00:59:18.16 --> 00:59:24.56 Totally. But, you know, it's something that's actually cool that you said is there's a couple
00:59:24.56 --> 00:59:28.40 different ways to view. Like the award system in the military can be a little questionable.
00:59:28.40 --> 00:59:31.44 There's people who can kind of peel that bag and go, man, is that legit or not?
00:59:32.48 --> 00:59:36.72 We had two different categories of the same award. We had what we called an endotur award,
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:40.48 so, okay, you know, pedagy offshore willink has been with us for three years. He's leaving the
00:59:40.48 --> 00:59:44.08 squad or the unit or whatever and he's going, we want to recognize his body of work.
00:59:44.08 --> 00:59:48.08 It's kind of like a participation award. It doesn't have a ton of meaning other than
00:59:48.08 --> 00:59:52.16 you survived your three years. We want to thank you in your way out. There was something else we
00:59:52.16 --> 00:59:58.24 called was an impact NAMM or we had a term called a strived by NAMM. Oh, we called it a spot NAMS.
00:59:58.24 --> 01:00:01.36 Yeah, same same thing. It was just a spot. Just the same. It's the same thing.
01:00:01.36 --> 01:00:03.92 A crack in a spot. Which means like it was going out of style.
01:00:03.92 --> 01:00:09.36 Oh, there's no way to make this, this, this, make this serious. This five man's.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.04 The behind behind that is like you can take a middle or the road dude.
01:00:13.04 --> 01:00:17.92 Middle road guy who's, who's not your all-star quarterback, not your top tier guy. And he's
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:22.56 over there doing some good work. Yes. So maybe that was me. Do you? Yeah, maybe I don't know.
01:00:22.56 --> 01:00:28.000 They were trying to encourage her. Five is a bit ridiculous. I don't have five of anything,
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.48 but there is a way to, to, when you, when you recognize somebody for their work,
01:00:35.12 --> 01:00:38.88 it's a heck of a lot better to recognize them for something they're doing when we call the impact
01:00:38.88 --> 01:00:44.08 or the spot as opposed to, well, you've been with us for five years. You get to watch. Like,
01:00:44.08 --> 01:00:48.40 that's our thing. So here's your, here's your, you've been here for five years as opposed to,
01:00:48.40 --> 01:00:51.36 hey, that thing you did that specific thing. If you could recognize people for that,
01:00:53.20 --> 01:00:57.76 in this leadership little system you're trying to create is, it's really good to recognize
01:00:57.76 --> 01:01:02.32 people for the work that they do when they do it as opposed to, well, we just sort of have this
01:01:02.32 --> 01:01:07.92 process that by these wickets or these little checkpoints you get recognition, which over time
01:01:07.92 --> 01:01:15.36 sort of undermines the value of it. And, and again, five's a, whoa, that's a lot of the name is not it.
01:01:15.36 --> 01:01:19.84 I mean, you're talking about straight up essentially a participation trophy. Like, you, oh, you've been
01:01:19.84 --> 01:01:25.92 here five years. My name was a participation award. I was leaving, captain's got names.
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:30.56 I don't care if you were the number one captain or the number 12 captain when you left. You got an
01:01:30.56 --> 01:01:35.84 am. And the number one guy, guy didn't go, well, I actually earned this one. And the number 12 guy didn't
01:01:35.84 --> 01:01:41.68 think of this as garbage. It had no real meaning. The impact, what you call it, a spot. The spot
01:01:41.68 --> 01:01:47.84 name. That's a, that's, there's a lot more legitimacy to that than, hey, thanks for being here.
01:01:47.84 --> 01:01:51.28 Do you got to look on your Facebook, like you're all fired up for my names?
01:01:51.28 --> 01:01:56.32 Well, here's the thing, but that's a perfect point right there because if there, if a spot
01:01:56.32 --> 01:02:01.84 name and a regular participation trophy name is the same sort of thing, then it's like, oh, wait,
01:02:01.84 --> 01:02:05.28 you got to differentiate those two because if you're, you're saying you got to five. There is a
01:02:05.28 --> 01:02:10.40 differentiation on the name that is you can get a V, which is when it becomes a combat award. Yeah.
01:02:10.40 --> 01:02:18.32 So a name with a combat V or a combat distinguishing device is what they call it. So it has a V on it.
01:02:18.32 --> 01:02:23.92 And that's, that's a legit award. And I, a lot of guys in tasking a bruiser got names with Vs.
01:02:24.96 --> 01:02:30.24 And those names with Vs that the guys got in tasking a bruiser were hard earned. They weren't like,
01:02:30.24 --> 01:02:35.76 oh, you're just going to, you, there was some gunfire near, but no, like these guys were in 18
01:02:35.76 --> 01:02:41.20 fire fights, and they got a name with the V. And, and you know, the, some of the guys in, in tasking a
01:02:41.20 --> 01:02:47.92 bruiser, some of Stoner's guys, they got the R com, which is the Army Commendation Medal with the V.
01:02:47.92 --> 01:02:52.64 That was a huge deal because those things are tough to get the R. And that came out of those things.
01:02:52.64 --> 01:02:57.84 And that came from the, from the Army recognizing what you were doing, which, which added that,
01:02:57.84 --> 01:03:01.20 which added to that as well. Yeah. There's a couple things in the military have a little bit of
01:03:01.20 --> 01:03:07.76 sanctity. The V, whether it's a name, a com, whatever it is, the V that has, there, there's,
01:03:07.76 --> 01:03:13.12 me, you can't just get a V. You got to earn that combat distinguishing device. The other one of
01:03:13.12 --> 01:03:17.68 them, Rincor that, shouldn't say the Rincor, Navy the Rincor is what we call the car. The
01:03:17.68 --> 01:03:21.84 combat actually ribbon, they don't like to just, you don't just, that's not a participation award.
01:03:21.84 --> 01:03:26.000 You, you got to earn that car. Yeah. And the C.I.B. in the Army, which is the combat
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.24 infantry badge, which means you, you, you, you, you've been in combat. Yes. Yeah. And that's, that's what,
01:03:32.80 --> 01:03:41.20 that's what Hackworth called out, uh, the Admiral for Admiral Borda for wearing a combat V.
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:47.52 On his name, it was actually, I think it was, it was a name with a V on it. And he, and Hackworth said
01:03:47.52 --> 01:03:51.04 this guy was in Vietnam, but he wasn't using on a ship. He wasn't in direct combat with the,
01:03:51.04 --> 01:03:56.64 and Admiral Borda killed himself. Yeah. Over this drama over it, it's crazy. Now that I'm,
01:03:56.64 --> 01:03:59.76 you know, we're sitting here laughing, you're like, oh, this, we can't never get serious again. All
01:03:59.76 --> 01:04:04.64 we have to do is talk about Admiral Borda and, and, and, and Colonel Hackworth called him out for
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:17.28 wearing a combat V and he kills himself in the Navy yard. Back to your five Nams. If some of those
01:04:17.28 --> 01:04:22.56 were like, for some solid work you did on this little thing, that you thought maybe wasn't that
01:04:22.56 --> 01:04:26.32 huge of a deal, but you did some good work in people saw what you did and you were like, hey,
01:04:26.32 --> 01:04:30.80 hey, look, you didn't save the world, but you did really good with that little, whatever you did.
01:04:30.80 --> 01:04:33.36 That's different than a participation trophy type situation.
01:04:33.36 --> 01:04:38.48 Prudition. All fired up. I was stoked, you know, I was trying to work hard, trying to do a good job,
01:04:38.48 --> 01:04:43.68 and people were giving me cool recognition, and I appreciated it. I'm just saying that you fast forward it
01:04:43.68 --> 01:04:53.20 from 1995 to like 2009, and we're back from Ramadi, and I'm putting my dress uniform on and
01:04:53.20 --> 01:04:57.68 stone or sees me, and we're laughing, because I have five Nams, which is really, really, really,
01:04:57.68 --> 01:05:01.84 it's also especially ridiculous. I was an officer, and it's like an officer, if you're an officer,
01:05:01.84 --> 01:05:06.24 you got five, I mean Dave Burke, you know, who is in the Marine Corps for 24 years?
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:09.92 Had one NAMM, and there I was walking around with five. That's kind of, it's just,
01:05:09.92 --> 01:05:16.32 it's not fun to be funny about it. So to the officers and chiefs that gave me recognition as a
01:05:16.32 --> 01:05:23.04 young and listed guy, I appreciated it, it meant a lot to me, but over time it did become a little
01:05:23.04 --> 01:05:26.24 bit funny and a little bit ridiculous that I was walking around with five Nams. I'm going to have to
01:05:26.24 --> 01:05:30.88 now post a picture, I don't think I have any of this stuff anymore, but I realized that I'm
01:05:30.88 --> 01:05:37.04 probably coming off as NAMM obsessed at this point. You are a little bit, but I'm sure they
01:05:37.04 --> 01:05:41.76 end. I'm going to write you up for one. So you ever got to employ you the month at, you know,
01:05:41.76 --> 01:05:46.24 you, I was in the military, my whole life, right? No, you worked at Wendy's. Oh yeah, I was never
01:05:46.24 --> 01:05:50.32 in play the month. Okay, but isn't that the same thing? Employee the month?
01:05:52.32 --> 01:05:55.76 I would rather get a NAMM than employ you the month at Wendy's. But it's the same thing.
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:01.12 It's just not in the military, you're just saying. It's a similar thing. Nams were harder to get
01:06:01.12 --> 01:06:04.000 that employee the month. There was no guarantee that a NAMM was being issued.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:10.96 Right. They got to choose somebody, but still same deal as far as the structure. You seem
01:06:10.96 --> 01:06:16.56 saying where it's like you're getting awarded for something you did even though in your mind,
01:06:16.56 --> 01:06:22.08 it might not be that big of a deal. But as an individual like process, it's kind of a thing.
01:06:22.08 --> 01:06:26.000 It's something. It's just not nothing, you see. We'll go with it. We'll go with it.
01:06:28.56 --> 01:06:33.20 All right, back to the book. Summary and conclusion, the job of those of us who are privileged to
01:06:33.20 --> 01:06:40.88 command to create superior units from the ordinary run of manpower made available to us. This manpower
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:45.52 falls into upper middle and lower groups about equal and strength that have different capabilities,
01:06:45.52 --> 01:06:50.32 present different problems and need to be handled differently. All of the men in a unit must be
01:06:50.32 --> 01:06:56.16 assumed to desire to do what is wanted and when they do not, they have not been properly handled
01:06:56.16 --> 01:07:03.04 and instructed. And I would add the word led there. The best and most reliable unit is usually
01:07:03.04 --> 01:07:09.36 the one that is excellent in all things, even though it might not be superior in any way.
01:07:10.48 --> 01:07:16.88 So that's the different he breaks out the hierarchy of adjectives, the highest adjective being
01:07:16.88 --> 01:07:21.20 superior and then below that is excellent and excellent is better to be excellent in everything
01:07:21.20 --> 01:07:26.88 than superior and one thing. Throughout the whole job runs the problem of motivation, this problem
01:07:26.88 --> 01:07:31.52 is not solved unless steps are made to motivate the unit carefully thought out and applied in
01:07:31.52 --> 01:07:37.04 such a way that their effect is felt by all men in the unit. Finally, excellence of the unit is measured
01:07:37.04 --> 01:07:42.24 by the extent to which those of the lower third of the unit are developed to play their part
01:07:42.24 --> 01:07:49.12 of the unit team. You know, still 100% on board with that one. As far as I'm concerned,
01:07:49.12 --> 01:07:52.88 motivation is about understanding why you're doing what you're doing and giving people ownership.
01:07:52.88 --> 01:07:55.76 You want to motivate people, tell them why they're doing what they're doing and let them take
01:07:55.76 --> 01:08:03.68 ownership about it and run with it. I feel like motivation is like kind of there's like short
01:08:03.68 --> 01:08:08.48 term in long term and you know like I was thinking of something very specific at the time where
01:08:09.36 --> 01:08:14.32 you know people get mad when they get angry at something that motivates them like super hardcore
01:08:14.32 --> 01:08:18.56 but only short term and then if somebody someone's the opposite if someone's really happy or
01:08:18.56 --> 01:08:24.64 I don't know thankful or whatever that keeps them sort of motivated long term. That's good. I would agree
01:08:24.64 --> 01:08:31.12 that unless they have like some sort of weird underlying fear of something that might sustain them
01:08:31.12 --> 01:08:35.60 long term. Yeah, you could get into some details but I think a broad statement that like some
01:08:35.60 --> 01:08:44.96 kind of an anger would be a short more of a short term motivation and a happiness, a satisfaction,
01:08:44.96 --> 01:08:49.20 a gratification would be more of a long term. I would agree with that. I would tend to agree with that.
01:08:49.20 --> 01:08:54.96 All right, now we're going to get into, um man, I thought those were kind of like, hey we'll
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:58.80 just burn through some of those chapters. I'm sorry because I wanted to get to this chapter which
01:08:58.80 --> 01:09:05.12 is called chapter 13, Mission Type Order, the problem of control in World War II, those who
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:09.68 served in armored divisions and probably in other units as well learned that mission type orders were
01:09:09.68 --> 01:09:16.48 requirement if the most was to be obtained from a command. Since then we have had and mission type
01:09:16.48 --> 01:09:21.92 so what mission types orders are just in a nutshell is you tell somebody what needs to happen,
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:28.40 you let them go for your how to do it. It's very, it's the basis of decentralized command.
01:09:28.96 --> 01:09:35.60 Since then we've had to consider the control of operations in the fluidity and unpredictability
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:42.32 of nuclear battle. As battle becomes more complex and unpredictable responsibilities must be
01:09:42.32 --> 01:09:49.92 more and more decentralized. Thus mission type orders often will be used at all echelons of command
01:09:49.92 --> 01:09:55.68 and probably will be the rule at the division and higher levels. This will require all commanders
01:09:55.68 --> 01:10:03.52 to exercise initiative, resourcefulness and imagination operating with relative freedom of action.
01:10:03.92 --> 01:10:07.76 And this is what's weird, you know, he he oscillates between these sort of like,
01:10:07.76 --> 01:10:12.80 everyone should be, you know, how do we control the man and he literally says in that earlier chapter
01:10:12.80 --> 01:10:19.04 the the middle group is easier to control and now he's saying hey you need to let them go and operate
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:23.12 and it's really scary. I thought he was going to start talking about nuclear war. What do you
01:10:23.12 --> 01:10:30.88 think about nuclear war? I think centralized control. I want 17 people to make sure that that is the
01:10:30.88 --> 01:10:38.56 right move before that freaking fire button gets hit and those two keys get simultaneously turned. But
01:10:38.56 --> 01:10:46.80 he's like no decentralized command. That's pretty scary to me. In our tactical, in our tactical
01:10:46.80 --> 01:10:51.52 forces we have built in organizational flexibility. We must recognize this and capitalize it
01:10:52.16 --> 01:10:58.80 in our orders to get maximum combat power. We must have plans flexible enough to meet rapidly
01:10:58.80 --> 01:11:05.12 changing situations. But careful planning is not enough. This must be coupled with the readiness to change
01:11:05.12 --> 01:11:11.60 and adapt the situations as they are not as they are expected to be. Awesome. What's interesting
01:11:11.60 --> 01:11:17.20 about that is he says we need to make plans flexible enough to meet rapidly changing situations.
01:11:17.20 --> 01:11:21.04 And he says, but careful planning is not enough. When I think of careful planning, I think all
01:11:21.04 --> 01:11:24.96 this guy is going to sit there and plan every detail. I don't think of somebody that's thinking,
01:11:24.96 --> 01:11:29.84 hey, we're going to come up with a very flexible plan. A flexible plan to me is not careful planning.
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:36.24 I guess I might be reading too much into that. But I always felt like I cheated all the time
01:11:36.24 --> 01:11:44.56 because I came up with flexible plans for things. Yeah, it seems like a carefully plan or a
01:11:44.56 --> 01:11:50.64 plan plan carefully is like you carefully carefully plan for contingencies. Yeah, I guess carefully
01:11:50.64 --> 01:11:55.28 plan doesn't necessarily mean to be doesn't need to be overly detailed and fat. Carefully plan
01:11:55.28 --> 01:11:58.88 could be like, hey, we want to be careful that we don't put too much detail in here.
01:12:01.60 --> 01:12:06.96 And then yes, being able to adapt to situations as they are, not as they were expected to be,
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:12.24 that's a critical way to operate. To train commanders and staff officers for operations in
01:12:12.24 --> 01:12:16.56 war where mission type orders will be widely used. It is necessary that tactical courses in our
01:12:16.56 --> 01:12:22.40 schools teach the use of such orders and that when widely employ mission type orders in our
01:12:22.40 --> 01:12:30.48 peace time operations, I love that. So when you're going to give people assignments to clean up the
01:12:30.48 --> 01:12:35.20 building, you don't say you mop and you scrub and you clean and you go, no, you say,
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:38.32 how I'm building clean? This is what time it needs to be done by and you let them go execute it.
01:12:38.32 --> 01:12:47.20 Boom, decentralized command mission type order. And think about that. I just kind of blew that
01:12:47.20 --> 01:12:52.56 off, but that's a real thing. Like if you don't train people and you don't live like this,
01:12:53.68 --> 01:13:00.64 then you won't get good at it. You have to actually live like this. This has to be your way of life.
01:13:00.64 --> 01:13:09.20 If the way that you run your day-to-day operations is micro management, how can you expect
01:13:09.20 --> 01:13:13.76 anybody to do anything other than be micro management when you get into a bad situation,
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:21.44 get into combat situation. Something really solid on EF online that I was exposed to when
01:13:21.44 --> 01:13:26.40 you were like, hey, when you're in a meeting or you're having a meeting or something and everyone's
01:13:26.40 --> 01:13:30.64 there with their pan and paper waiting for you to say something to write stuff down and then we
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:34.24 start talking and then they start writing stuff down or whatever. It's bad sign. Yeah, it's a bad sign,
01:13:34.24 --> 01:13:38.48 but it even, but it feels good. It feels good. You know, and can do anything unless big job
01:13:38.48 --> 01:13:44.16 man rolls in. But the big ego in the plan. You're really a horrible leader if they're all sitting
01:13:44.16 --> 01:13:49.04 there waiting. Yeah, we got two or three questions. We already know what we're doing. We know what we're
01:13:49.04 --> 01:14:00.000 going. Yeah, we're good. Oh, this is beautiful. Scope of a mission type order. Basically a mission
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.72 type order needs to cover only three important things. One, it should clearly state what the
01:14:06.72 --> 01:14:12.16 commande what the commander issuing the order wants to have accomplished. That's number one. This is
01:14:12.16 --> 01:14:17.92 what this is what you need to accomplish. Number two, it should point out the limiting or control factors
01:14:17.92 --> 01:14:25.36 that must be observed for coordinating factors. So, okay, you can't go across this area. You can't fly
01:14:25.36 --> 01:14:31.12 over this region. You can't enter into this zone. Here's the limitations. And then finally,
01:14:31.12 --> 01:14:36.96 it should delineate the resources made available to the subordinate commander and the support which
01:14:36.96 --> 01:14:42.40 he can't expect or count on from sources outside of his command. That's all you need to know.
01:14:42.40 --> 01:14:47.76 Tell me what to do. Tell me what the limitations are. Tell me what resources I have. Other than that,
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:57.20 leave me alone. I'm going to go make it happen. That's that might be the clearest definition
01:14:57.20 --> 01:15:03.60 of a mission type order I've ever read in my life. That's all you need. I got asked one time
01:15:03.60 --> 01:15:10.32 I was in my first deployment to Iraq and my boss is like, what information do you need and how
01:15:10.32 --> 01:15:16.88 much time do you need to launch on a mission? It was like, I need to know where the location of the
01:15:16.88 --> 01:15:27.04 target, the frequencies of the friendly forces, and I need 15 minutes and we'll go. Yes.
01:15:30.80 --> 01:15:36.08 Confidence in subordinate commanders, there is a strong reluctance at every headquarters to
01:15:36.08 --> 01:15:42.80 relinquish the authority to direct the details of an operation. This reluctance is clearly seen
01:15:42.80 --> 01:15:47.68 in the embellishments attitude in order as it threads its way down to company level. Careful
01:15:47.68 --> 01:15:52.48 judgment must be made at every echelon of command in stating the limiting and controlling factors
01:15:52.48 --> 01:15:57.52 of a mission type order. Confidence must be placed in judgment and ability of the subordinate
01:15:57.52 --> 01:16:03.84 commander. Too often what starts off as a broad mission type order at the high echelon ends up with
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:13.52 volumes of my new detailed and restricting instruction specifying how to get the job done when
01:16:13.52 --> 01:16:19.76 it finally gets down to company level. Many officers hearing this may think they would like to have
01:16:19.76 --> 01:16:24.40 a command functioning under such a system. Meaning I would love it if people would just do exactly
01:16:24.40 --> 01:16:28.80 what I told them to do but you don't want that. Others who may say they would like to work under such
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:33.92 a system really are disturbed by thoughts of it. There are some officers who require something
01:16:33.92 --> 01:16:39.28 in writing before they will take significant action. A mission type order requires the subordinate
01:16:39.28 --> 01:16:43.92 commander and his staff to make basic decisions and plans based upon a careful analysis of the
01:16:43.92 --> 01:16:49.20 situation. If the basic decisions or plans are not successful there is no paper foxhole into which
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:55.44 they can crawl. Mission type orders require initiative, promptness and resourcefulness which are
01:16:55.44 --> 01:17:02.80 not always forthcoming. Problems in service schools based upon such orders bring forth a variety of
01:17:02.80 --> 01:17:10.48 solutions which are difficult for the faculty to grade. Sometimes looms as a very important problem.
01:17:10.48 --> 01:17:18.96 What do you got? There are so much there. You haven't given this example of just cleaning the building.
01:17:18.96 --> 01:17:24.88 Just that little example of cleaning the building. The worst thing I can do as a leader is to tell
01:17:24.88 --> 01:17:30.80 you how to do that. The minute I tell you how you know what you're going to do exactly what I told
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:38.32 you. I'm going to say this and this. What are the chances I get it all as a leader? Zero. What
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:42.56 you're actually going to do is what I told you to do. I'm going to miss a couple of things and
01:17:42.56 --> 01:17:46.72 actually the outcome is not going to be what I want. I'm going to expect him like hey you didn't do this
01:17:46.72 --> 01:17:50.96 and what happens is I trust you less. I'm going to make sure I manage even more which means you
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:55.76 have even less initiative the next time. The connection from how to initiative and what I wrote down
01:17:55.76 --> 01:18:00.88 was how by me telling you how to do what I want you to do and I'm not saying like teaching you how to
01:18:00.88 --> 01:18:04.96 do something. I'm telling you how I want it done. That's the how you're talking about. Of course,
01:18:04.96 --> 01:18:09.68 I want to teach you how to do a task or a job. I need to train you. He's talking about this is how
01:18:09.68 --> 01:18:15.04 I want you to do this task which is totally different than the exact opposite of initiative.
01:18:15.84 --> 01:18:19.76 Because if I tell you how to do it, you're going to do exactly how I told you to do it.
01:18:19.76 --> 01:18:23.36 And then the things that I've missed, the things that I've committed, I don't know because I'm
01:18:23.36 --> 01:18:28.000 farther away from the problem than you are. I'm going to trust you less because the outcome is
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.56 going to be the one I want. I'm going to micromanage more. I'm going to undermine your initiative
01:18:30.56 --> 01:18:33.84 even more and then when you're out there doing it on your own and I actually can't get to you
01:18:34.48 --> 01:18:37.60 which is the connection from the training to the real world. There's why you have to live this all the
01:18:37.60 --> 01:18:41.84 time. That's when teams and organizations fail because I'm not going to be there to solve this
01:18:41.84 --> 01:18:45.52 problems for you but I've bred this in you the entire time because I'm always telling you how I want you to
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:50.08 do it and you're like, cool, I'll do exactly how you told me to do it and I'm not going to do this.
01:18:50.08 --> 01:18:52.96 I'm not going to do that. You even know about this over here. I'm just not even touching that because
01:18:52.96 --> 01:18:57.04 you didn't tell me about that at all but if you go the exact opposite which was hey,
01:18:58.80 --> 01:19:02.32 however you want to get this done, that's all good. What we need to get it done is by 1600
01:19:02.32 --> 01:19:05.68 on Wednesday because what happens at 1700 on Wednesday is this and this and in fact,
01:19:05.68 --> 01:19:11.04 all that go make it happen. All of that is your initiative to go make that happen.
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:16.40 Just the connection between me telling you how I want it done versus your initiative and the
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:20.08 inverse relationship between those two and how often we see that done wrong.
01:19:21.04 --> 01:19:29.36 That's what you're driving with a micromanager direction, give her. You know driving with you,
01:19:29.36 --> 01:19:33.44 you're just like whatever takes it here, whatever kind of thing and that's a good move. Even if
01:19:33.44 --> 01:19:38.40 I make wrong turns, whatever, you'll help. But what else can you help? And you'll help whatever.
01:19:38.40 --> 01:19:42.40 But you get in, you ever drive with somebody who's like hey, don't be in this lane, this lane is like
01:19:42.40 --> 01:19:47.76 too slow or whatever. And it's like okay, make this turn. It's got like a micromanager, what do you call them?
01:19:48.48 --> 01:19:53.04 Front seat drive, back seat driver, whatever. That kind of person. Let's say it's your
01:19:53.04 --> 01:19:57.92 significant other. I'm not saying it's my significant other. Not my friend. That's not hypothetically.
01:19:57.92 --> 01:20:03.60 Hypothetically. Yes. Someone who you drive with a lot is the same. So in every time it's like,
01:20:03.60 --> 01:20:08.80 hey, you know, we're going to go this route. Hey, get out of this lane, go in this lane. Okay, take this turn.
01:20:08.80 --> 01:20:12.48 You know, okay, it's coming right, you know, like really kind of micromanaging you're driving
01:20:13.20 --> 01:20:16.72 situation. After a while you sort of, you kind of get used to that.
01:20:18.48 --> 01:20:21.36 Yeah. And now of a sudden you're not paying attention. They go, wait, tell you,
01:20:21.36 --> 01:20:24.96 you're supposed to take that turn. You're like, why didn't you tell me that? It's a weird subconscious.
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:32.40 Why don't you tell me Sarah? Charles. It's a subconscious, almost dependence.
01:20:32.40 --> 01:20:37.76 For sure. That's 100% what it is. That's 100%. That's the initiative comment that I'm the
01:20:37.76 --> 01:20:41.52 connection to. It was like, I'm going to take no initiative because I'm you've been training.
01:20:41.52 --> 01:20:48.000 Yeah. You just wait to be told what to do exactly right. So just like how you're saying where now
01:20:48.80 --> 01:20:53.84 if let's say I'm dependent on you to give me directions, you don't, you know, the leader,
01:20:53.84 --> 01:20:56.32 whatever, he doesn't always get it right or whatever. I make the wrong
01:20:57.20 --> 01:21:01.68 call or you don't give me direction. We'll say you don't give me direction. I take no action. And then,
01:21:01.68 --> 01:21:06.64 of course, it's done wrong. Now you trust me less and now and around and around we go.
01:21:06.64 --> 01:21:11.20 You know, so I'm thinking, and I'm micromanage you more and I stifle even more of your initiative.
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:15.36 Even more. Exactly right. You know what's crazy about this and Dave V. and I
01:21:15.36 --> 01:21:22.56 were talking about this before we press record is like, I basically think in commanders intent.
01:21:22.56 --> 01:21:28.72 Like I think the way my mind works, I think in end states and everything else to me is just
01:21:28.72 --> 01:21:36.32 sort of this almost like an annoyance of reality. And I'm so far like when I want to do something,
01:21:36.32 --> 01:21:40.72 I'm so there that everything else is just sort of going to fall in the place and I'm not even thinking
01:21:40.72 --> 01:21:45.76 about it. You know, whether it's like when I'm starting to write a book like I know what that book is,
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:48.96 I know the end state and I want it looks like and now I just have to get those words out of my
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:54.56 system when we're going to launch something. It's like, I already know what's going to happen.
01:21:54.56 --> 01:21:59.20 Now even if you think about something as stupid as this podcast of me being like echo,
01:21:59.20 --> 01:22:01.84 can you make a podcast and you're like, well, let me go figure it out. You figured out, I'm like,
01:22:01.84 --> 01:22:07.44 I don't even care nothing. I care zero. You show up with what you could have shown up with a with a
01:22:07.44 --> 01:22:12.16 freaking a tape recorder and I would have been like, okay, is that what it sounds good? All right,
01:22:12.16 --> 01:22:16.72 we're good because I know what I know where this is going to go. I know where we're going.
01:22:16.72 --> 01:22:22.08 And so wherever we're going to get there, it's like an annoyance to me and it's an annoyance of
01:22:22.08 --> 01:22:29.12 reality because of where my mind is what I'm thinking about where we're going. And that's a positive
01:22:29.12 --> 01:22:34.40 thing for a couple reasons. Number one, if you're working for me, if you're making stuff happen,
01:22:34.40 --> 01:22:40.000 if you're good, you're good to go. I mean, you can just, you make stuff happen. We're good. We're
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.92 totally good. I'm never going to bother you. Never going to bother you. So that's rad. And then also
01:22:45.92 --> 01:22:54.40 the, the, I'm not going to call up in these details, which means that step that I take is going to be
01:22:54.40 --> 01:22:58.56 a big one. It's going to be a big step. It's not going to be a little, and I'm not going to take half measures.
01:23:00.64 --> 01:23:05.68 Yeah, we're going in the distance. So I'm thinking and acting in kind of living in like
01:23:05.68 --> 01:23:14.80 in a commander's intent kind of way. Yeah, it's not kind of, for those of us that are inside that
01:23:14.80 --> 01:23:20.64 sphere, the byproduct of you is a leader thinking in outcomes and in states. If that's how you're thinking
01:23:20.64 --> 01:23:26.48 and leading your people, the natural reaction of the people around you is to fill in all those things
01:23:26.48 --> 01:23:31.44 to make sure that happens. And if you can take it a step further, if you can take it a step further
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:37.28 as a leader, and also be comfortable with the other side of it, which is a phrase that you use all the time,
01:23:37.28 --> 01:23:43.12 which I love, which is, you got to expect those things to happen. Then it's no factor if exactly
01:23:43.12 --> 01:23:45.68 how you had this picture in your mind, you got to live these two little, little, little,
01:23:45.68 --> 01:23:51.36 little, little problem here. Yeah, those things are going to happen. And we and we can solve those things,
01:23:51.36 --> 01:23:56.48 too, using the exact same approach, which is if you have that attitude as a leader, when your
01:23:56.48 --> 01:24:00.40 people run into problems, then I'm not going to be pan-extricking about what is the boss going to
01:24:00.40 --> 01:24:03.92 think, because he's going to say, I expect those things happen. Those things are going to happen.
01:24:03.92 --> 01:24:08.48 And I'm going to end up solving that as well. And so if you connect the idea of thinking in
01:24:08.48 --> 01:24:13.04 and states around your people and also letting your people know, you're not going to fly off the handle,
01:24:13.04 --> 01:24:16.08 and jump right in, they're starting to micromanage them when they get these little hiccups,
01:24:16.08 --> 01:24:21.04 these little deviations, because you actually in your mind, Joko, haven't thought about all the things
01:24:21.04 --> 01:24:24.40 that happened between here and here. You're really care was going on in here. Cool, you go off the
01:24:24.40 --> 01:24:28.96 act, cool. I expect those things to happen. But the minute you lay that all out, like all these
01:24:28.96 --> 01:24:32.000 30 steps to get there and one doesn't go right, and then you're involved in that,
01:24:33.76 --> 01:24:37.60 what that does is stifle your people makes it so much harder for them to get to your
01:24:37.60 --> 01:24:44.16 end state. So just combine the two of thinking in those end states, and then letting your people
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:48.32 solve those things along the way, and not overreacting to the problems that occur as you're getting
01:24:48.32 --> 01:24:53.20 there, because things are messy. Those things are messy. But by the way, if you're thinking about
01:24:53.20 --> 01:24:56.96 all those things in between, you don't even, you're not even going to think about it. I think about
01:24:56.96 --> 01:25:00.80 the end state. A bigger picture. You're going to be thinking like, hey, we need to move
01:25:00.80 --> 01:25:05.68 to this next ridge on. You're not thinking about where you're going to end up in two days on this
01:25:05.68 --> 01:25:09.68 operation, or we're going to end up strategically in three months. You're like, you're not even thinking
01:25:09.68 --> 01:25:12.96 about that. You're thinking about, wait a second, there's an obstacle right in front of us. What are we
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:18.000 going to do? And me, well, I'm like, I'm care. I literally don't get as 19 different ways to solve that
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.40 problem. Pick one of them and roll with it. Oh, you, oh, it didn't work. And you got to try again,
01:25:22.40 --> 01:25:25.92 cool. Whatever. I'm still over here. And guess what? I'm looking off in the distance. So we're good.
01:25:27.28 --> 01:25:34.40 That's a good point. And maybe, I don't know, maybe I'm my experience, which is nothing, but in my experience,
01:25:34.40 --> 01:25:40.48 is like under appreciated or whatever, like not flying off the handle and things go wrong.
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:46.96 Like if you, like, you know, you're like, I can come up with this true though. Like, yeah,
01:25:46.96 --> 01:25:50.40 you know, people have this misconception of you. Like, oh, what if Dr. Guggets
01:25:50.40 --> 01:25:56.16 Maddo you for making this or doing that? The reality is you don't really get mad at mistakes.
01:25:56.16 --> 01:26:01.04 You know, like you might tease me a little bit of whatever. But yeah, like you don't get mad.
01:26:01.04 --> 01:26:06.64 But what that does is, and what I was listening to you did say that and stuff. It made me remember.
01:26:06.64 --> 01:26:11.60 Yeah, that's true. Like, I don't have a fear of making the wrong move if we both know where
01:26:11.60 --> 01:26:16.56 we're sort of going. And guess what? That means you can move. That means you can, you can make two,
01:26:16.56 --> 01:26:22.64 three, four, seven moves. You can make seven moves. And you never had to talk to me.
01:26:22.64 --> 01:26:27.20 And six of them were right. Nine of them were right. 11 out of 12 were right. There was one
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:31.44 wrong one. It set you back a half a move. And then you press forward and there was no factor.
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:37.68 If I was concerned that Jocquo is going to get mad at me for, I don't know, what if I make the wrong
01:26:37.68 --> 01:26:41.84 decision on this? Like, should we do this or should I do this or should I not do this or whatever?
01:26:41.84 --> 01:26:46.000 But I'd be like, you're going to keep making this in time. Like, probably it would work way
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.20 work. Yeah, somebody quoted you on Twitter. It was like a great way to not waste your people's
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:56.56 time is to not make the, to every, not make sure that you're the one that's making all decisions for.
01:26:56.56 --> 01:27:00.64 Not make them rely on you to make those decisions. That's a great way to not waste their time. Yes.
01:27:01.44 --> 01:27:05.28 And the beauty of that is that they're going to get you to where you want to go faster.
01:27:05.28 --> 01:27:09.36 For sure. I think you're right. I don't want that. For sure. All right. So this is how they
01:27:09.36 --> 01:27:13.92 close out the section. This is, once again, this is such a, there's a dichotomy with general
01:27:13.92 --> 01:27:19.76 Clark. And this is part of that dichotomy right now. And he's talked about it before the channel of
01:27:19.76 --> 01:27:27.76 suggestion. I have said many times that a commander has two channels within which to operate.
01:27:28.32 --> 01:27:36.48 He has the channel of command, barking orders and the channel of suggestion. I believe that a good
01:27:36.48 --> 01:27:41.92 commander who has subordinate to our trained and have the confidence to use mission type orders
01:27:41.92 --> 01:27:47.60 can operate almost exclusively using the channel of suggestion,
01:27:47.60 --> 01:27:55.60 preserving the channel of command for for use only when he wants to give special emphasis to an order
01:27:55.60 --> 01:28:02.56 to relieve someone or to take disciplinary action. That's the only time he's talking
01:28:02.56 --> 01:28:06.16 other than that. It's like, well, how do you want to do it? What do you think we should do? The only
01:28:06.16 --> 01:28:11.76 time he's going to bark orders is when he's going to fire someone, which is what relieves means
01:28:11.76 --> 01:28:16.48 by the way, and in the military relieves someone means you're firing them or to give disciplinary
01:28:16.48 --> 01:28:23.52 actions. Every other time, almost exclusively, it's channel of suggestion. You just made the leap
01:28:23.52 --> 01:28:27.76 by saying it was in my hand as when I'm hearing suggestion. I'm not even hearing suggestion. I'm
01:28:27.76 --> 01:28:31.84 hearing questions. Hey, what do you think? How do you think which isn't even what is that
01:28:31.84 --> 01:28:35.20 in saying in word? Because suggestion means like, hey, what maybe we should do this, you're taking
01:28:35.20 --> 01:28:40.000 it a step further, which is how do you think we should do this? And then the flip side is who is
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.80 that the hammer of, you know, as a commander, you have that hammer. You can drop that hammer.
01:28:44.80 --> 01:28:49.20 I can fire somebody. I can relieve somebody. I could reduce their rank. I could take their pay.
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:55.76 There was a lot of authority in command. How often do you want to pull out that hammer? Man,
01:28:56.88 --> 01:29:02.88 the more, you know, you just pulled out the big, the big hammer, right? What about the little hammer?
01:29:02.88 --> 01:29:07.20 If the little hammer is even worse, the little hammer of like, actually Dave, we need to do it this way.
01:29:07.20 --> 01:29:11.92 Smack. Little, you know, actually Dave, I don't like your idea. Smack. And meanwhile,
01:29:11.92 --> 01:29:17.68 you're getting all dinged up. And now you don't want to make any moves anymore. The suggestion is,
01:29:17.68 --> 01:29:24.48 is, is actually question. How should we do this? Yeah. Channel of suggestion. Here's the final
01:29:24.48 --> 01:29:28.48 little section. And this is, I briefed you earlier, Dave, I said, there's going to be some moment
01:29:28.48 --> 01:29:34.72 to read that you're going to say yes. So this is that section, further the mission of the higher
01:29:34.72 --> 01:29:39.28 headquarters. I went to Levinworth and people think of Levinworth, they think of going to prison
01:29:39.28 --> 01:29:43.20 because there is a military prison there, but there's also the war college. I went to Levinworth
01:29:43.20 --> 01:29:47.20 over 20 years ago. So it is difficult for me to remember all the things which I must have learned
01:29:47.20 --> 01:29:52.64 then at the command in general staff college. The one thing that I have never forgotten and which
01:29:52.64 --> 01:30:00.40 is stood me in good stead was the teaching of general McNair, then common don when he stated,
01:30:00.40 --> 01:30:08.72 quote, when you receive an order or a directive from your next to higher commander, do everything
01:30:08.72 --> 01:30:15.36 you can and in the best way you can to further the mission which he wants to accomplish.
01:30:17.12 --> 01:30:24.16 And quote, and officer who follows his advice and uses it to interpret his instructions will find
01:30:24.16 --> 01:30:28.24 that he can act wisely properly and aggressively with confidence, he will have no problem in operating
01:30:28.24 --> 01:30:34.64 in an environment with mission type orders. So when your boss tells you to do something,
01:30:34.64 --> 01:30:41.76 freaking do it and do it to the best here ability. Leadership strategy and tactics.
01:30:42.40 --> 01:30:48.64 I always have to go to this page, but it's the things that says how to succeed is a new leader.
01:30:48.64 --> 01:30:56.16 Page 157 and then on page 158, it says lastly get the job done. Get the job done. That's what
01:30:56.16 --> 01:31:00.32 you're supposed to do. And that's what he's talking about. When you get told to do something,
01:31:00.32 --> 01:31:04.48 do it. People talk to me and how do I build a good relationship with my boss? Do the job
01:31:04.48 --> 01:31:09.92 and do it well. Kick ass. Give your boss credit. You'll start building a good relationship with him.
01:31:17.12 --> 01:31:22.96 Chapter 14. Organization for performing tasks on the company in small unit level. The purpose of
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:27.12 this chapter is set forth a concept of which I've found from experience improves training,
01:31:27.12 --> 01:31:32.16 uses time devoted to training more efficiently and increases responsibility prestige and
01:31:32.16 --> 01:31:35.76 morale of the non-commissioned officer, leader and platoon leader.
01:31:41.52 --> 01:31:47.12 Organization, use organizational units or teams even for work details. I'm not going to read this
01:31:47.12 --> 01:31:53.68 section, but what he says, we're using this example today of cleaning the building. What he's saying is
01:31:53.68 --> 01:31:58.64 when you clean the building, do it as a platoon. So use mission type orders and then do it as a platoon.
01:31:58.64 --> 01:32:05.36 And that just helps them get used to how operating together, what people are like, what it's
01:32:05.36 --> 01:32:10.96 like for that leader, what how that leader relates to the troops, how the troops relate back
01:32:10.96 --> 01:32:19.36 to the leader, you train, how you operate, you work, how you train. And then there's the last
01:32:19.36 --> 01:32:24.72 section in this part is let the leader lead his men, which is the same thing. Under the detail
01:32:24.72 --> 01:32:30.88 procedure of performing necessary unit tasks, all training teams are represented at all scheduled
01:32:30.88 --> 01:32:36.32 training. This may make a good showing in their training accomplished records, but does not necessarily
01:32:36.32 --> 01:32:41.52 mean that they have actually received as teams the training that is shown on record. However,
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:49.44 maintaining unit integrity while performing daily tasks will also enhance real benefits,
01:32:49.44 --> 01:32:57.20 which we derive from our team training. So every day you should live, you should operate,
01:32:57.20 --> 01:33:00.08 the way you are going to live and operate.
01:33:04.48 --> 01:33:10.48 Chapter 15, wasting soldiers' time. The value of time. We Americans have always been conscious of the
01:33:10.48 --> 01:33:14.80 value of time, Benjamin Franklin expressed this by saying that time is money. In our country,
01:33:14.80 --> 01:33:19.28 the efficiency expert who comes into examine ways of doing things to eliminate wasted
01:33:19.28 --> 01:33:26.000 motion is highly paid for his services. He commands that high price because he is a saver of time.
01:33:27.04 --> 01:33:33.52 In the army, we speak of resources in terms of the three M's. Men, money, and materials.
01:33:34.16 --> 01:33:39.60 To these three, we must add time. However, there's a distinct difference between time and the
01:33:39.60 --> 01:33:45.28 other three resources. If we do not use our money or materials today, they are available tomorrow.
01:33:45.28 --> 01:33:51.36 To a lesser degree, this is also true of men. It is not at all true of time. For the time,
01:33:51.36 --> 01:33:56.80 it is a highly perishable commodity. An hour loss today is lost forever.
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:03.76 Echo Charles. That's true. I feel like he's training a lot of soldiers today, I'm certain.
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:10.80 It costs several thousand dollars a year to maintain each soldier in the army. I consider
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:14.72 that it is probably a cost of five dollars per hour per man for the soldiers training time.
01:34:14.72 --> 01:34:19.92 That is available to the company commander. Thus, when the commander weighs an hour of his company's
01:34:19.92 --> 01:34:26.000 time, he may be wasting as much as a thousand dollars. We would not want to be embarrassed if some
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.76 age to see key became interested in investigating this in the field. That's an interesting way to think
01:34:29.76 --> 01:34:35.28 about. Think about, you know, company is 150 men. But think about your company. Think about your
01:34:35.28 --> 01:34:41.04 business. Think about your team. You got people sitting and you want prepared for the meeting or
01:34:41.04 --> 01:34:45.92 the meeting starts late or whatever. Whatever it is. Think about what you're throwing away.
01:34:45.92 --> 01:34:54.000 You're wasting people's time. We are engaged in a contest with the communists in which there
01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.24 is no civil matters in which no civil metal will be awarded for second place. I'm certain that
01:35:00.24 --> 01:35:04.48 it is unnecessary for me to dwell on the importance of the role of the US Army in this contest.
01:35:04.48 --> 01:35:11.36 Our mission is to become about ready to my way of thinking combat readiness has no upper limit.
01:35:13.44 --> 01:35:18.16 A unit is never 100% combat ready because there is always room for improvement in the
01:35:18.16 --> 01:35:23.60 development of military skills. Reaction time, marksmanship and the like combat readiness is a
01:35:23.60 --> 01:35:28.08 gold toward which we are constantly moving, but which we should never feel we have wholly achieved.
01:35:29.28 --> 01:35:34.32 Our progress will depend on our use of the resources which I mentioned previously.
01:35:34.32 --> 01:35:38.32 I want to stress the importance of using time wisely.
01:35:40.48 --> 01:35:46.80 And then he goes through a bunch of how we waste time, time is wasted in administration and paper
01:35:46.80 --> 01:35:55.52 work and red tape. And he says this, you should consider it unforgivable.
01:35:57.04 --> 01:36:02.56 You should consider it unforgivable to remove a man from a scheduled formal period of instruction
01:36:02.56 --> 01:36:09.52 or practical work to take care of administrative matters. You cannot requisition a replacement for
01:36:09.52 --> 01:36:16.80 a lost hour of training. He also says here, we waste time when we overcome it are units.
01:36:18.16 --> 01:36:23.20 Or perhaps I should say we do not make the best use of our time. That's something we got to
01:36:23.20 --> 01:36:28.40 pay attention to on an individual level. You over schedule yourself and you actually add up wasting time.
01:36:28.40 --> 01:36:34.88 Here. The same wastage is presented on the individual level when the strength of a unit is
01:36:34.88 --> 01:36:42.24 filtered away to participate in contest of non-military skills to paint rocks or plant flower beds
01:36:42.24 --> 01:36:49.04 in a likeness of the units insignia. That's a shot right there. You go around military
01:36:49.04 --> 01:36:53.04 paces in America. There's some painted rocks out there, people. There's some white painted rocks
01:36:53.04 --> 01:36:58.96 that align in some roads. And I'm going to tell you, some private painted those rocks. They probably
01:36:58.96 --> 01:37:03.84 got in trouble. It's a little bit of a punitive measure. Oh, like punch. Yeah.
01:37:09.36 --> 01:37:13.76 It is training activities themselves which have the greatest potential for wasting a soldier's
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:19.12 time. This comes about mainly because of ina-enatic with planning lack of foresight and lack of
01:37:19.12 --> 01:37:24.48 preparedness. Soldiers expect to be well trained. They feel short-changed if they're not.
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:27.04 If you're in charge of training people, which if you're in a leadership you are,
01:37:27.04 --> 01:37:32.08 position you are in charge of training people and you're wasting your time. You are completely wrong.
01:37:32.96 --> 01:37:36.64 Here's another section. I got a read read. What are the instructions clear?
01:37:38.24 --> 01:37:44.80 There is no end of time wasted when one who is to perform a mission or job is not fully and clearly
01:37:44.80 --> 01:37:50.72 instructed. The instructions are misunderstood. The end result is not what was desired.
01:37:50.72 --> 01:37:57.28 It must be done over. In fact, if things go wrong, the leader, in fact, when things go wrong,
01:37:57.28 --> 01:38:01.44 the leader should check first to see if his instructions were not the cause.
01:38:02.80 --> 01:38:10.48 It is said that general Grant assigned his adjutant the mentally slowest officer he could find.
01:38:10.48 --> 01:38:17.60 Grant read his orders to his adjutant and if the adjutant could not understand, grant
01:38:17.60 --> 01:38:25.20 rewarded his orders until he could. Ask yourself, are your instructions and orders so clear
01:38:25.20 --> 01:38:31.28 that every man, underlined every, doesn't underline much near every man in your unit, can
01:38:31.28 --> 01:38:38.32 understand them. When you issue orders, you are instructing someone. Remember that as an instructor,
01:38:38.32 --> 01:38:48.000 you only teach when someone learns. That's the, I always tell that started with the lowest
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.48 common denominator, right? It's matter of fact, it's in, I think it's in dichotomy.
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:59.68 Well, hey, lay for safe. I'm telling them, hey, I want you to brief to the lowest
01:38:59.68 --> 01:39:04.88 con-common denominator in the platoon. Whoever you think is going to have the hardest time,
01:39:04.88 --> 01:39:10.56 brief to your machine gunners, your new guy machine gunners, I want them to fully understand the plan.
01:39:15.68 --> 01:39:21.44 I mean, that is the entire second law of combat brief. Almost verbatim that he just described
01:39:21.44 --> 01:39:25.84 about the plan that's understandable the way he communicated and then to the lowest common denominator
01:39:25.84 --> 01:39:30.48 and then to me in my mind that actually comes back to the common he made earlier, which was
01:39:30.48 --> 01:39:37.76 the effort you got to expand from your lowest people in the bottom of your folks to
01:39:37.76 --> 01:39:41.44 for them to understand that that comedy made before by devoting time to that, that's the time
01:39:41.44 --> 01:39:46.40 he's talking about. So it takes his adjutant who he considers to be of the lowest intellectual
01:39:46.40 --> 01:39:52.000 level, his bottom third guy. And I'll spend as much time as I need until that guy gets it.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.16 And if he gets it, they're good to go. And so even pulling that together, that common made. I mean,
01:39:58.16 --> 01:40:07.52 that is that is simple right there. So good. Do you fully, this is the last section here,
01:40:07.52 --> 01:40:12.32 do you fully utilize your soldiers' time? I am not optimistic as to believe that we can eliminate
01:40:12.32 --> 01:40:16.72 wasting of time as we have yellow fever, but we can improve our performance in this regard.
01:40:16.72 --> 01:40:20.48 We can control this problem by the exercise of sound leadership techniques among which are
01:40:20.48 --> 01:40:25.36 planning good job management issuance of clear instructions and thorough follow-up. The most
01:40:25.36 --> 01:40:29.28 valuable resource available to a commander in the army is the soldier's time.
01:40:31.92 --> 01:40:38.000 As leaders, we must use this resource to the best advantage. I know of no better reputation for an
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.84 officer or non-commissioned officer to have with his men, then that he is a good manager and does
01:40:43.84 --> 01:40:49.20 not waste his soldier's time. If he has that reputation, he will probably not waste his men's
01:40:49.20 --> 01:40:55.12 lives and badly there. That's powerful. I've been doing a lot of talking about leadership capital,
01:40:55.84 --> 01:40:59.04 on the F-Online. In fact, I've been going kind of a Zerak talking about leadership capital on the
01:40:59.04 --> 01:41:02.56 F-Online. And I've been talking about how to build leadership capital, how to lose leadership capital.
01:41:03.28 --> 01:41:08.24 And this is one that I haven't mentioned yet. And it's probably one, it's probably a little bit
01:41:08.24 --> 01:41:14.08 of a blind spot to me because I am a free coin it comes to time and wasting time. And so it's one
01:41:14.08 --> 01:41:20.32 of those things where I would, it's so important to me that I've never, I've never walked into a meeting
01:41:20.32 --> 01:41:24.000 two hours late to have a bunch of people waiting around for me to show up. Like, that doesn't,
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:31.76 that's not happening. But if you want to expend leadership capital unnecessarily and lots of it,
01:41:31.76 --> 01:41:41.60 make people wait around for you, make them waste time. The phrase being late is unacceptable.
01:41:41.60 --> 01:41:49.84 The reason it's unacceptable is because it's waste peoples' time. You could be the best pilot in
01:41:49.84 --> 01:41:56.24 the squadron. And if you waste peoples' time, you're going to lose leadership capital. You could
01:41:56.24 --> 01:42:03.28 be an average pilot. And if your reputation is that you don't waste people's time, they don't care
01:42:03.28 --> 01:42:12.88 if you're an average pilot. Your leadership capital is directly correlated to how you treat them
01:42:12.88 --> 01:42:19.12 and how you respect them and how you respect their time. Time wasted was always the, it was always
01:42:19.12 --> 01:42:22.40 the most frustrating and the most obvious thing that would happen. I think I've said this on the podcast
01:42:22.40 --> 01:42:27.36 before. Everybody who's had their time wasted by someone else knows exactly what that feels like.
01:42:27.36 --> 01:42:31.68 You can think about it right now, sitting around in the auditorium, sitting around whatever this,
01:42:31.68 --> 01:42:36.32 that time of yours that's being wasted because of somebody else. I don't care how good that
01:42:36.32 --> 01:42:39.52 somebody else is at their job, their task or anything else. If they are at time,
01:42:39.52 --> 01:42:45.68 a wester, you're losing leadership capital. Let me ask you this about being late.
01:42:45.68 --> 01:42:51.52 Oh, man, here we go. It's time to be. I need your opinion on what if it's, let's say,
01:42:51.52 --> 01:42:56.08 Halloween party and they're like, hey Halloween party, you know, there's going to be, I don't know,
01:42:56.08 --> 01:43:00.24 100 people. There's a lot of people who are fashionably late scenario. You're getting to,
01:43:00.24 --> 01:43:07.12 or what have you. You know, so there's 100 people invited or whatever, 100 plus because
01:43:07.12 --> 01:43:11.12 bring who you want it. It's not like a guest list. You're not invited. It's not that. It's just
01:43:11.12 --> 01:43:17.36 we're having a party, whatever. And starts at, I don't know, wasting time. How long is this going to take?
01:43:17.36 --> 01:43:22.80 Speaking, all right, it starts at five. Okay. Say, five p.m. Okay.
01:43:22.80 --> 01:43:28.48 Goes all night. I don't know. Whatever. And you're like, all right, and you get there. It's
01:43:28.48 --> 01:43:35.28 630. Other people are there. But you get there at 630. Is that what you see people say? Is that bad?
01:43:35.28 --> 01:43:40.48 It's for a game late. If I send you an invitation to my Halloween party. And I say, the party starts at five
01:43:40.48 --> 01:43:49.52 and goes till midnight. I don't care when you show up. If I say echo be there by seven and you show up at
01:43:49.52 --> 01:43:56.56 730. Is there a difference between those two? I think so. Yes. Yeah. But yeah, so my questions
01:43:56.56 --> 01:44:00.48 more about that first scenario, whatever. Like if it's like, hey, the party starts at five.
01:44:00.48 --> 01:44:04.80 Yeah, I was going to say the party starts with or without you. Yeah, I'm super concerned about you.
01:44:04.80 --> 01:44:11.92 Yeah. Nobody's sitting around waiting for you to get. But the contrary, the podcast starts when
01:44:11.92 --> 01:44:18.16 you're here. So when you're not here, the podcast doesn't start. You're the ones with the SD
01:44:18.16 --> 01:44:24.32 memory cards that go in the little machines over there. So when you're not here at three o'clock,
01:44:24.32 --> 01:44:30.32 the party's not starting. We're waiting. Understand. You're of your talking like it's for real.
01:44:30.32 --> 01:44:35.60 I was here at 258. What up? You made it in. Yeah. It was legit today. As much as hassle I give you about
01:44:35.60 --> 01:44:43.52 Hawaii and time and being late. You're not late. Very often. Do you play with fire? Yes,
01:44:43.52 --> 01:44:48.64 yeah, every day. I think. And technically a lot of times there's a minute, maybe if you set
01:44:48.64 --> 01:44:52.48 you were one of those people, if you set your watch like five minutes fast, you probably be on time all the time.
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:57.60 Yeah, if I believe it or if I didn't know, is it the what? Yeah, I've done that before too. Well,
01:44:57.60 --> 01:45:00.96 Ian, how are you to tell you like, oh, I come from a long line of late people.
01:45:00.96 --> 01:45:07.28 There, my words. I'm from my dad. He's so very cracked up because I said, like, you got your
01:45:07.28 --> 01:45:13.44 DNA. You said you got your 23 and me. I said it came back. You got the
01:45:13.44 --> 01:45:20.32 old genius. Yeah, sir. But, and you know, you kind of look into it all like, why am I late or
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:25.92 whatever. So I would go to work late when I used to work at the cloud. I would be there late.
01:45:25.92 --> 01:45:30.96 I was there late one minute two minutes. Five minutes sometimes probably more time than I was on time.
01:45:30.96 --> 01:45:35.28 Probably for real. I'm not finding this hard to believe. It doesn't seem like a stretch.
01:45:35.28 --> 01:45:39.20 And the thing is technically you are right. Like I'm wasting people's time. Especially if
01:45:39.20 --> 01:45:44.24 if people depend on me to get there at that time. You know, I'm not getting paid. You know,
01:45:44.24 --> 01:45:48.80 it's the kind you got to clock in. So you're not getting paid if you're not there. So it's not that.
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:53.36 It's like if you were depending on you to be there. But is there like a briefing to start the night?
01:45:53.36 --> 01:45:57.76 No, no, you didn't start. It's like clock in and you're there. I mean, it would piss me off.
01:45:57.76 --> 01:46:04.000 You know, yeah, I do. It's the most un reliable person that I put no value in as a human.
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:11.52 Thank you. And I did it. But, so I analyzed like, why am I like that?
01:46:12.24 --> 01:46:16.56 Because even if I'm like, I need to be late less. You know, just wouldn't change. Why am I like?
01:46:16.56 --> 01:46:20.96 And you should change the statement. I need to be late less. Do I not going to be late?
01:46:20.96 --> 01:46:26.000 Yeah. But draw a little bit of a harder line in the sand. I understand. And your right.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.24 My problem is you're right. The thing is you're right. But when I when I really be truthful,
01:46:30.24 --> 01:46:35.28 it's because I don't care about what's going on there. You know, like why am I going to
01:46:35.28 --> 01:46:41.28 prepare like take 30 minutes to prepare this and prepare that for something that I don't have to be there
01:46:41.28 --> 01:46:45.36 at that. I have to be there at a certain time. So of course I'm running the risk. If I did, if I would
01:46:45.36 --> 01:46:50.56 have my way, I would never be late at all. But I would never be early at all either. For things I
01:46:50.56 --> 01:46:56.000 don't care about, you know, like like that. I had one time in my life when I was going to college
01:46:56.56 --> 01:47:03.28 at and it was really hard to get parking. And eventually I figured out a system. But I had a
01:47:03.28 --> 01:47:08.000 seal buddy that he was going to college tune. We would study together. And we are but we were both
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.24 on time all the time for everything. And eventually we made a deal where we gave ourselves like a
01:47:14.24 --> 01:47:20.08 waiver to be five minutes or eight minutes late because if you were going to be there at two
01:47:20.08 --> 01:47:25.60 o'clock in order to be there at two o'clock, you had to show up at one and drive or and so we were
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:29.52 just like, you know what? Hey, if you're five minutes late, 10 minutes late doesn't matter. Like I don't care.
01:47:29.52 --> 01:47:35.84 I don't want you being here an hour early so that you're not one minute late. So we made a little
01:47:35.84 --> 01:47:41.44 packed and just said, hey, bro, I'll be there between one and one fifteen boom, all good. And I
01:47:41.44 --> 01:47:44.88 try and get there and one and maybe I get there at one o'clock, maybe he get there at one twelve or
01:47:44.88 --> 01:47:50.24 whatever. Eventually I figured out I would just put my bike in the back of the car and just
01:47:50.24 --> 01:47:54.08 park at the top of the hill and just bike no factor. Yeah, see you now here. So you're going to
01:47:54.08 --> 01:47:59.12 solve these problems. So on the flip side and this is all in the spirit of getting down to the whole
01:47:59.12 --> 01:48:03.60 late thing because I agree with you at the end of the day and if you think if you really be honest,
01:48:03.60 --> 01:48:10.000 like I'm not late, really, you know, anymore. Back in my day, for a whole late. Yeah.
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.76 So what are you trying to think of when I was late? No, you were late a little bit the beginning,
01:48:15.76 --> 01:48:20.80 but then, but then like I didn't, I probably remember you being late three times total. Yeah.
01:48:20.80 --> 01:48:27.04 And this is not including a four minute grace period. Which sometimes I think you do just to
01:48:27.04 --> 01:48:31.28 just to, you know, what do you mean grace period? You know, like sometimes if you're supposed to
01:48:31.28 --> 01:48:36.32 be here at one, you're here at one o'clock. Yeah. Four minutes late. It's possible. Yeah, the late
01:48:36.32 --> 01:48:40.64 times I'll tell you, hey, I'm late because of this specific reason or whatever, but that's already,
01:48:40.64 --> 01:48:45.20 but nonetheless, like that is I agree with you where you're wasting other people's time people are
01:48:45.20 --> 01:48:54.000 waiting for you like that's it's it's kind of inexcusable in a way. But if you show up 15 minutes early,
01:48:54.80 --> 01:49:00.000 aren't you wasting your own time a little bit? No, because what are you going to do when you get there?
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.40 You're going to prep. Yeah, well that depends. Yes, depends on me. All right. Sun Siu told us 2,500
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:11.28 years ago that the one that shows up the battlefield first wins. Yeah, you know, as far as battlefields
01:49:11.28 --> 01:49:19.28 go for sure. But certain circumstances, if you're there, let's say, okay, yeah, I'm going to meet you
01:49:19.28 --> 01:49:25.68 for brunch. You know what's in my bag right now? Well, I could prep the next book I'm reading on the podcast.
01:49:25.68 --> 01:49:29.68 When I show up here early, if there's no one here, cool, I get to read. I get to get ahead.
01:49:29.68 --> 01:49:34.80 Oh yeah, okay, so that's a good point. Okay. Yes. Question answered because yeah, if you show up fit and you
01:49:34.80 --> 01:49:41.04 got to be thinking I guess at the end of the day. So if you show up 15 minutes early, you're not wasting
01:49:41.04 --> 01:49:47.12 your time because you can still choose what to do. You're not forced to wait around for not waiting.
01:49:47.12 --> 01:49:51.04 Yeah. You should be proactive. We're making something happen. Yeah, and you have that option.
01:49:51.04 --> 01:49:54.48 I mean, technically, I guess if you're waiting for someone you have that option, but like to be
01:49:54.48 --> 01:49:58.80 there putting you in that position, rather than you making the decision, putting yourself in
01:49:58.80 --> 01:50:07.68 that position potentially. I understand. Back to the book, chapter 16. So I was super fired up when
01:50:07.68 --> 01:50:13.68 I read this chapter title and then beyond so the guy got a little less fired. I got into it. But
01:50:13.68 --> 01:50:22.24 because the chapter is will you wait for it or will you go get it? It's a whole day. This is the
01:50:22.24 --> 01:50:29.20 chapter I've been waiting for. But what he's talking about is information. I'm so fired up for
01:50:29.20 --> 01:50:32.64 gathering information and are you going to wait for information to come to you or you're going to
01:50:32.64 --> 01:50:36.80 go get it? I'm still I'm so fired up about it, but I'm not as fired up as I was. It's just like
01:50:36.80 --> 01:50:43.12 which is going to make things happen. But he goes in here. There's more than one school of
01:50:43.12 --> 01:50:49.52 fought concerning how a commander can acquire reliable information. One school contains it to
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:53.28 command or should analyze reports that come to him from his subordinate units and staff. The other
01:50:53.28 --> 01:50:58.32 advocates at the commander should go see for himself yet another endorses a combination of these methods.
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.28 As a commander from company to army group and an as a observer of others holding such
01:51:05.28 --> 01:51:13.44 positions in three wars, let's get a few a little bit cool the right. I have come to certain conclusions
01:51:13.44 --> 01:51:18.56 myself. Moreover, since my retirement from the army, I have worked as a consultant to research
01:51:18.56 --> 01:51:22.24 organizations, baking studies of command control and communication problems for the army,
01:51:22.24 --> 01:51:27.28 the result of this active and retired experience might be helpful to students and practitioners
01:51:27.28 --> 01:51:31.84 who should who would like to excel in the art and techniques of command or ship in general ship.
01:51:33.04 --> 01:51:39.60 And then he goes here looking back, it seems to me more than ever that my best information on both
01:51:39.60 --> 01:51:47.04 our own forces and the enemies was obtained by visiting or observing subordinate commanders.
01:51:47.04 --> 01:51:53.76 There you go, I guess he's saying go get it. This is done either by Jeep or fixed wing airplane,
01:51:53.76 --> 01:51:58.96 borrowed from the artillery, small radius. He goes on. He says this.
01:52:00.64 --> 01:52:06.64 As a core commander in Korea with five divisions on the line, I often left my headquarters by
01:52:06.64 --> 01:52:10.80 chopter by chopper after morning staff briefing and I visited the five division headquarters
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:14.64 in turn from left to right. The divisions knew when I was coming, the division commanders were told
01:52:14.64 --> 01:52:20.80 that they need not wait for me and that I would talk to the chiefs of staff over a cup of coffee.
01:52:20.80 --> 01:52:25.76 We discussed the latest situations. Then we discussed the problems which had been presented
01:52:25.76 --> 01:52:32.24 by them on a previous day. Then I noted what they wanted my core headquarters to do to help them.
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:37.44 So that's all good. He's gathering information. And then he says, I told them the situation of the
01:52:37.44 --> 01:52:44.88 8th Army and of the I Corps as I knew it. Not only is he out there receiving information, he is
01:52:44.88 --> 01:52:54.72 telling them what is going on. He ends up saying that he did that. It's funny. I was reading this
01:52:54.72 --> 01:53:00.72 and he says, generally the next day repeated this as a result. I was not only the core commander,
01:53:00.72 --> 01:53:05.84 but the core commander liaison officer and to a large extent the core communicator with the lower units.
01:53:05.84 --> 01:53:10.08 And I put in parentheses when I was reading this, it was a static war because at this point
01:53:10.08 --> 01:53:16.88 Korea, it was almost trench warfare like they weren't moving. And then what's interesting,
01:53:16.88 --> 01:53:21.44 fast-forwardal would be says, this was an astatic situation, but such command techniques are not
01:53:21.44 --> 01:53:32.48 unusual and mobile warfare. So get out there, get that information. He's got this section in here.
01:53:32.48 --> 01:53:36.88 History is full of instances where the commander being at the critical point at the critical time
01:53:36.88 --> 01:53:42.88 turned the tide of battle to victory or conversely the commander not being on scene. His force was
01:53:42.88 --> 01:53:48.96 defeated. A few such examples have been related so dramatically as in the poem shared and dried
01:53:48.96 --> 01:53:55.92 by Thomas Buchan and Reed. So we're talking civil war. We're talking general Philip Sheridan,
01:53:55.92 --> 01:54:02.48 union general who was five foot five. We're talking about height a little bit earlier.
01:54:02.48 --> 01:54:08.40 Well, he was known as Little Phil. Also known as fighting Phil and the battle of Cedar Creek
01:54:08.40 --> 01:54:14.72 October 19th, 1864s when this went down. One will recall that early in the morning. Sheridan was
01:54:14.72 --> 01:54:21.44 at Winchester, Virginia 20 miles away from his command when news of a new battle arrived.
01:54:21.44 --> 01:54:27.20 He mounted his horse and took off at full speed for the field of combat. Reed's stirring
01:54:27.20 --> 01:54:32.56 verse traces Sheridan's progress through five standards, stands as giving equal credit to both
01:54:32.56 --> 01:54:37.36 him and his horse. The six stands are shows what happens when the commander arrives at the critical
01:54:37.36 --> 01:54:45.28 point of battle and at a critical time. Quote, the first, the general saw were the groups of
01:54:45.28 --> 01:54:52.000 stragglers and then the retreating troops. What was done? What to do? A glance told him both.
01:54:52.72 --> 01:54:59.44 Then striking his spurs with a terrible oath. He dashed down the line, mid-a storm of
01:54:59.44 --> 01:55:06.80 Hazaz, which I had to look up. That's an old form of hooray. So the people started, ah!
01:55:06.80 --> 01:55:16.72 The wave of retreat checked its course there because the site of the master compiled it to pause.
01:55:16.72 --> 01:55:22.08 So there you go. The commander shows up on the battlefield and he turns this retreat into an
01:55:22.08 --> 01:55:28.80 advance and they ended up kind of smashing the Confederates in that battle. It is inconceivable
01:55:28.80 --> 01:55:32.24 that the same result could have been attained on an automated battle field.
01:55:32.24 --> 01:55:41.20 Nor could Sheridan have been brought. Could have Nor could Sheridan have brought order out of chaos
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:45.76 while seated before a display panel 20 miles away. You need to get there.
01:55:46.96 --> 01:55:53.92 Need to get there. Then he talks about why commanders should be forward.
01:55:56.72 --> 01:56:02.000 He talks about the computer stuff and again he's right and this originally came out.
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.88 I think in 1963 and then this version was 1973. So he's talking about computers.
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:17.12 So God only knows what that consisted of in 1973, like a mobile command computer.
01:56:17.92 --> 01:56:22.64 We need to get a, I need to do some research on that one. He says these are fine until
01:56:22.64 --> 01:56:27.92 disorderly and confusing conditions that occur so often in battle materialized.
01:56:27.92 --> 01:56:32.80 They do not realize the roles of judgment. So he's talking about all these computations and these
01:56:32.80 --> 01:56:37.76 things that they set up and he said once those are cool and everything's cool. But then once
01:56:37.76 --> 01:56:42.88 the mayhem happens, they do not realize the roles of the judgment and experience factors which
01:56:42.88 --> 01:56:48.24 must be used in handling tactical battle reports. Inevitably, these lead to a working principle
01:56:49.12 --> 01:56:55.12 such as and so here's what the commanders are using to judge their information when they're using
01:56:55.12 --> 01:57:02.48 the computer based data. Discount by 50% all very favorable or unfavorable operational reports
01:57:02.48 --> 01:57:06.88 which come into your headquarters from your subordinate units and then question the remainder.
01:57:07.52 --> 01:57:16.000 So it's basically like this just junk. It's just junk. And then he talks about the helicopter
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.88 and using that to stay forward, which is effective as well. He's got this whole, this whole chapter
01:57:22.88 --> 01:57:33.12 ADP and war will it work. It's automatic and data processing. So we're not going to cover much of
01:57:33.12 --> 01:57:37.68 this and he sets up this sort of hypothetical situation where he starts asking a bunch of
01:57:37.68 --> 01:57:43.60 questions about how well this ADP, how well it's going to work to use ADP during war. And a lot of this
01:57:45.52 --> 01:57:49.44 you know he's talking he's literally talking about like are there going to be power sources
01:57:49.44 --> 01:57:55.12 available. So it's really kind of nitty gritty stuff. But then he says I would not be honest with you
01:57:55.12 --> 01:58:02.000 if I did not point out that commanders at all echelons are apprehensive of the tendency to use ADP
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:09.60 to facilitate centralization of command and control. I can foresee disastrous effects from indiscriminate
01:58:09.60 --> 01:58:16.56 from indiscriminate centralization or over centralization and loss of flexibility in modern
01:58:16.56 --> 01:58:22.64 fluid war. Why is that? Because now all of a sudden the leader can track everything that everyone's
01:58:22.64 --> 01:58:25.76 doing. Hey, like Dave's in his aircraft and he's like wait a second go a little bit further
01:58:25.76 --> 01:58:29.36 to the right go a little bit further to the left. We know exactly where you are. Wait don't drop the bomb
01:58:29.36 --> 01:58:37.28 yet. Okay drop it now and we're trying to micro manage. Will ADP cause the commander to be more
01:58:37.28 --> 01:58:42.48 command post bound and thus reduces ability to be at critical points at critical times?
01:58:42.48 --> 01:58:49.12 Well, it's a tentative up in a yes with its increased speed and capacity for information. Will ADP
01:58:49.84 --> 01:58:56.80 in the hands of staff officers or of higher headquarters tend to encourage them to put increased
01:58:56.80 --> 01:59:02.88 burden of reporting on lower echelons who are often busily engaged in the vital conduct of battle.
01:59:02.88 --> 01:59:09.68 How crazy is that, Dave? It's not picturing what I saw from the top and the command center,
01:59:09.68 --> 01:59:15.60 you know picturing this being 19 was 76. We said yes the answer to that question is yes it will.
01:59:16.32 --> 01:59:19.92 Yeah so that's what happened in the military. All of a sudden we have the ability to get information
01:59:19.92 --> 01:59:23.44 so we're going to reply to the information. We're going to want more of it and you're going to
01:59:23.44 --> 01:59:28.48 demand it at a time that is totally incompatible with when they should be giving it the information.
01:59:28.48 --> 01:59:31.28 You want to know what's going on? Yeah. Well the reason you don't know what's going on is
01:59:31.28 --> 01:59:35.20 I'm in the middle of doing something right now. Yeah. The god of little situation I'm trying to handle.
01:59:35.20 --> 01:59:42.16 Yeah. Yeah so that's how he explains the whole ADP thing.
01:59:46.24 --> 01:59:50.72 Chapter 18 making progress and improving a military organization. It is the aim of anyone who's
01:59:50.72 --> 01:59:54.88 privileged to come in a company, batay and brigade or division to leave in it is to leave it in
01:59:54.88 --> 02:00:00.08 much better shape than he found it and to be sure his superior's recognized that fact.
02:00:00.08 --> 02:00:05.52 And he goes through this little plossess method which he's gone through before when he
02:00:05.52 --> 02:00:10.24 earlier podcasts, which you're going to make little incremental changes to get better.
02:00:11.44 --> 02:00:16.000 He goes over this section about protecting your image as a commander. A word about headlines,
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.80 most commanders who have sought headlines to establish their image and I'm using those,
02:00:20.80 --> 02:00:25.28 those are, he's putting those in quotes. In the minds of their men and their
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:31.52 peers have sooner or later have been plagued by unfavorable headlines. Produce a superior,
02:00:31.52 --> 02:00:38.000 well-rounded in solid unit and your image as a commander will be secure as will your military future.
02:00:40.80 --> 02:00:46.56 And then this is the, this is the last thing that we are going to cover. I think.
02:00:47.68 --> 02:00:53.44 Well no it's not, not clear to you that. Yeah this. All right so chapter 19
02:00:53.44 --> 02:00:59.44 techniques of troop orientation and informed education. One of the most important duties of
02:00:59.44 --> 02:01:04.88 a commander is to keep his troops informed and oriented. This is done in many different ways
02:01:04.88 --> 02:01:10.000 with varying degrees of effectiveness. A technique I found very effective was to inform an
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.76 orient by posters and personal visits. So he's talking about posters literally posters that you
02:01:15.76 --> 02:01:20.48 hang on the wall. And this is why when you were talking about simplicity earlier Dave,
02:01:20.48 --> 02:01:25.28 this is this is kind of knocking out of the park. And when I said earlier on this podcast,
02:01:25.84 --> 02:01:31.36 when I was giving him a grade of a D minus for his simplicity of language and his opening,
02:01:31.36 --> 02:01:38.48 he makes up for it here with these posters. In 1956 I took command of the 7th US Army
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:44.16 in Europe at a time when the relationship of the troops with their German neighbors was at a low
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:48.16 ab due to a number of things. I think this is also when hack worth was working for him.
02:01:48.16 --> 02:01:54.08 After studying the situation, I concluded that the transition from an army of occupation to
02:01:54.08 --> 02:01:59.52 the status of a guest army in a host nation had not been accomplished. So there's the wrong culture.
02:02:00.72 --> 02:02:08.96 There's the wrong culture from from occupation status to like host to a guest to a host nation.
02:02:08.96 --> 02:02:12.96 This is in Germany. So we went in there, we're occupying force. These were our enemies and now
02:02:12.96 --> 02:02:17.12 we're saying, all right, that's not the deal anymore. Now they're the host nation and we're the
02:02:17.12 --> 02:02:21.68 guest. So he can you imagine trying to shift that culture? That's a tough culture shift.
02:02:22.72 --> 02:02:27.12 I said out to bring about this transition not only for the soldiers, but for the dependence and
02:02:27.12 --> 02:02:33.68 US civilian employees in Germany and so he comes up with this poster that the poster is called
02:02:33.68 --> 02:02:39.84 soldier. And the soldier, the poster just has this picture of a soldier who looks badass
02:02:39.84 --> 02:02:49.52 and it says soldier, this is why you're in Germany. And it's got bullet points to play your
02:02:49.52 --> 02:02:56.32 part on the NATO team to help maintain peace by being constantly combat ready to be a good
02:02:56.32 --> 02:03:03.52 neighbor to our German neighbors to fight if necessary for the rights of free men in the world.
02:03:03.52 --> 02:03:11.60 Simplicity score. Dave, what are you giving him? That's a significant improvement over the
02:03:11.60 --> 02:03:19.76 year. The most improved. Most improved award. So very obvious. So that's what he did. He made this
02:03:19.76 --> 02:03:28.80 poster and and then he did these visits. He did these visits where he would take the troops and
02:03:28.80 --> 02:03:36.16 send them to check out what was happening at the Berlin wall. So it's another way to make people
02:03:36.16 --> 02:03:42.000 understand why. And not only would he send the troops, but he would if he could send the dependence
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.12 there as well. So they understood why. You go see the Berlin wall and then he made and this is the
02:03:47.12 --> 02:03:54.24 last thing we're going to cover again. He's making this so simple and so clear. So along with
02:03:54.24 --> 02:04:00.000 that campaign to get people to see the wall to understand what the purpose of being there was to
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:07.44 understand why we were there. He made this poster. There's a couple pictures of the wall and it says why
02:04:08.96 --> 02:04:17.68 and it says have you ever wondered why must the communists build walls and fences to keep people
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:25.36 from fleeing the land where they were born? Why must they charge their fences with electricity
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:33.12 which can kill people who try to escape? Why armed guards along these walls and fences shoot
02:04:33.12 --> 02:04:42.24 and kill their own people who try to escape from their homes? Why despite these walls and fences
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:49.76 and guns have over 4 million people left their homes, property and friends and risk their lives
02:04:49.76 --> 02:04:58.56 to escape in the past 15 years? Why the communists surround themselves with walls and fences when
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:05.84 history shows that this has often been the first step in the self destruction of an empire?
02:05:05.84 --> 02:05:14.96 Then he says why were these affectives? These posters and Operation Luxe which was actually
02:05:14.96 --> 02:05:20.24 traveling to the Berlin Wall were effective because they used the most efficient techniques of
02:05:20.24 --> 02:05:29.12 of informing and orienting the soldier and of having his commander tell him in basic and simple terms
02:05:29.12 --> 02:05:38.40 about situations which are close to him and affect or could affect him personally. He gets it
02:05:38.40 --> 02:05:49.84 across as simply as possible. So there you go. That wraps up our review of guidelines for the leader
02:05:49.84 --> 02:05:55.92 and commander. I have initiated the publication through Jockel Publishing of this book. We are
02:05:55.92 --> 02:06:02.48 reaching out to try and figure out what needs to happen there but it's underway. Bozac has it for action.
02:06:04.08 --> 02:06:08.88 So we'll get it out. We'll get it published. I'm sure that we will continue to refer to it.
02:06:10.88 --> 02:06:16.96 There's so many good lessons here. Even that last lesson that these posters were effective
02:06:17.52 --> 02:06:25.28 because they used the most simple terms to explain to the soldiers why they were doing what they're
02:06:25.28 --> 02:06:29.36 doing. Something that I've been talking about for 20 years explaining people why they're doing
02:06:29.36 --> 02:06:34.72 what they're doing and that is such an off that's such a such a response. We use all the time at
02:06:34.72 --> 02:06:40.96 S.L.M. front all the time. My people aren't doing this. My people don't want to get on board
02:06:40.96 --> 02:06:45.68 that tell them why they're doing what they're doing. Explain it to them in terms that they can
02:06:45.68 --> 02:06:55.84 understand. That's what he did. That's what he's telling us to do. Telling us to be more effective,
02:06:55.84 --> 02:07:02.08 telling us to be more efficient, telling us to not waste time telling us to be in good physical
02:07:02.08 --> 02:07:12.16 condition and to strive always. Remember what he said. You're never a hundred percent combat
02:07:12.16 --> 02:07:21.28 effective. You never get there. You always have to strive to be better. So thank you general
02:07:21.28 --> 02:07:31.52 Clark for that. Yeah, Coach Charles. Mr. Speaking of getting better or at least always trying to
02:07:31.52 --> 02:07:38.88 get better striving to get better. Yes. Do we have any recommendations on you know making that happen?
02:07:38.88 --> 02:07:45.36 Yes, we do. Dave. We do. I just thought Dave looked at his watch. He's just looked at his watch thinking
02:07:45.36 --> 02:07:52.16 all right. I know I have worked to do. You know what's funny. You know what? I know Dave has worked to
02:07:52.16 --> 02:07:59.76 do. I know I have a job. I know there's one person. I must say they don't have work to do, but they
02:07:59.76 --> 02:08:05.60 might have less work to do. They might have a less of a stringent timeline to follow. Well, you did
02:08:05.60 --> 02:08:13.92 say might because you know you never do know. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right.
02:08:13.92 --> 02:08:20.56 Okay. Okay. All the work I have to do. I'll tell you part of the work I have to do is inform my people
02:08:20.56 --> 02:08:26.72 our people. All right. Let's do it. On how to get through or should I say move forward on this path?
02:08:26.72 --> 02:08:32.08 We're all on boom. We're working out. We're taking due to if we can. We're reading. We're
02:08:32.08 --> 02:08:38.16 we're surrounding ourselves with good people. It's a sliding scale I understand. Nonetheless,
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:43.76 these are things we're trying to do on this path. We need supplementation. Don't worry.
02:08:43.76 --> 02:08:50.48 Jocco is fuel. It's called jocco fuel. Supplementation for your whole body all the way up to your brain.
02:08:51.36 --> 02:08:56.24 The last cell in your brain. Anyway, what we got joint warfare? We got a lot of stuff. I told you my wife
02:08:56.24 --> 02:09:01.44 has an injury. That's a lot of feeding or joint warfare. It's not our feet. All right. That's what I'm talking about.
02:09:01.44 --> 02:09:06.24 Well, yeah, every day. So, joint warfare. Super krill oil. These are all for your joints.
02:09:06.80 --> 02:09:10.40 Three bones keep yourself in the game. Don't even have to worry about them anymore. You take this stuff.
02:09:11.52 --> 02:09:19.84 Also, we have discipline. Just for your brain. Ish. It's not just for your brain. It's what I'm saying.
02:09:19.84 --> 02:09:25.28 True. It's for your body too. So discipline, discipline, go and then discipline, go in the cans.
02:09:25.28 --> 02:09:28.96 It's all the same family. We'll say that accurately.
02:09:28.96 --> 02:09:37.36 Wait a minute. Accurate. Yeah. It's true. Yeah. A little note on discipline go in the cans. So,
02:09:39.20 --> 02:09:47.44 look, are we at war? Yes. I would say yes. I mean, from a business sense, we're at war.
02:09:48.40 --> 02:09:51.36 We've had, we've been attacked. We had an act. Well, let's just say this out of
02:09:51.36 --> 02:09:59.84 it. And when we've had an act of war against us, another very large energy drink company
02:10:01.12 --> 02:10:09.28 has spotted an insurgency happening. They didn't like it. They're trying to maneuver to shut
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:17.44 down some of our manufacturing. But guess who had contingency planning? Yes, us. But where
02:10:17.44 --> 02:10:25.20 and where. So right now, hey, we are in a wall-watt in Florida. We want to be all over the East
02:10:25.20 --> 02:10:28.72 coast in a wall-watt and then we want to hit the rest of the stores across the country. If you're in
02:10:28.72 --> 02:10:37.36 Florida, go to a wall-watt, get some go, try some go. What flavors do you recommend? Dave?
02:10:39.68 --> 02:10:44.40 All of them. Let me ask you this. How many
02:10:44.40 --> 02:10:49.84 are you, are you, have you drank one flavor enough where you shifted to another flavor?
02:10:50.40 --> 02:10:55.20 Like I've done that with milk where I'll go on milk. I'll go on mint milk for three weeks. Then
02:10:55.20 --> 02:10:58.80 all of a sudden I'm like, well, that's strawberry. But right now, I'm on that pumpkin's,
02:10:58.80 --> 02:11:04.48 I'm on that smashing pumpkin pumpkin, pumpkin spice. That's that was crazy good. So have you,
02:11:05.60 --> 02:11:09.84 have you gone, are you go to rotate daily? Are you doing random out of the box? What are you doing?
02:11:09.84 --> 02:11:14.88 I try to go random out of the box or out of the fridge. I try to go random out of the fridge. I have
02:11:14.88 --> 02:11:20.08 not done that the last seven days. Because you're just straight. Dude, I am straight after
02:11:20.08 --> 02:11:27.20 burn orange. That's what I'm right now. So my older two daughters kind of speak their own language.
02:11:28.40 --> 02:11:33.76 And one of the words that they've been using a lot lately is if something is very good,
02:11:33.76 --> 02:11:37.52 then it's a fantasy and they say it in various funny ways.
02:11:37.52 --> 02:11:42.24 But then they've shortened it to say, FANTO. Oh, that's a FANT.
02:11:44.08 --> 02:11:52.24 And so the other day, my middle daughter took a drink of afterburner orange. And she said,
02:11:52.24 --> 02:11:55.36 oh, that's a FANT, like a FANTO.
02:11:58.32 --> 02:12:01.44 So there you go. There's a little, yeah, like orange FANTO, right?
02:12:01.44 --> 02:12:07.20 Yeah, there's a orange FANTO. I'm going to have to agree with that one. The orange afterburner
02:12:07.20 --> 02:12:10.32 orange. Yeah, that's the kind of the number one right now. It's good.
02:12:11.12 --> 02:12:16.000 Factually. I'm still just just jocopommer all day. Yeah. And I'm just having a chance.
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:22.56 I will have probably for every four jocopommer. I will have one orange or one
02:12:22.56 --> 02:12:28.08 sour apple sniper. Maybe a DAX average, even though DAX average, people like my wife's DAX
02:12:28.08 --> 02:12:34.40 average all day. Yeah, I could see that. Sometimes I just want to get a little like the coat of
02:12:34.40 --> 02:12:41.28 my mind set. Sure. Just go get some of that. That can just that can is legit. Yeah. Yeah.
02:12:41.28 --> 02:12:50.24 Yes, sure. But yes, so yes discipline energy drink essentially. I said it. Yes, I said what I said.
02:12:51.04 --> 02:12:57.52 Energy drink ish health energy drink. It's real energy is what it is. It's real energy.
02:12:57.52 --> 02:13:04.32 Yeah. So nonetheless, yes, these are the supplementation elements that we can call upon
02:13:04.32 --> 02:13:10.96 on this path. Also, jocchi imagine milk. So you got all these different flavors of milk,
02:13:10.96 --> 02:13:15.36 protein in the form of dessert. He just meant a smashing pumpkin. I'm with it. I'm with the smashing
02:13:15.36 --> 02:13:22.72 pumpkin. Oh, yeah. What about kid approved to buy a kid's kids are all over that? It was declared
02:13:22.72 --> 02:13:27.92 a full fantasy in my house. Full fantasy. Is that the largest declared
02:13:27.92 --> 02:13:32.32 last smashing pumpkin? A full fantasy. Full fantasy. Okay. I'm going to kind of remember that
02:13:32.32 --> 02:13:36.08 see if it sticks. Well, actually, I don't know if I want to do that nonetheless. It does sound cool.
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:41.68 When you say that your daughter said, but you can't start bringing it out. I can tell you that I won't
02:13:41.68 --> 02:13:49.04 start calling things like that. Oh, that will move in UFC was a full fantasy. Yes. Thank you.
02:13:49.04 --> 02:13:54.32 Not really, you're gonna flow. No, probably not. So speaking of full fantasy. Oh, that was cool.
02:13:54.32 --> 02:13:59.44 Yeah. This is a good cool. Speaking of cool and full fantasy. Jocco IT is also out there.
02:13:59.44 --> 02:14:05.20 Another light refreshing element that we haven't spent that much time talking about, but that's fine.
02:14:05.20 --> 02:14:10.24 It's still out there and it's still going strong. Of course. You can get that in a can as well.
02:14:10.24 --> 02:14:15.52 Right. You can get all this stuff at originmain.com. You can get it at the vitamin shop.
02:14:16.32 --> 02:14:21.68 Nationwide. You can get it at wall off Florida. This is what it was right now. It's November.
02:14:22.64 --> 02:14:25.92 Hopefully we'll get that whole East coast take a minute. Now, look, when I post that
02:14:25.92 --> 02:14:29.92 we're in a wall the other day. Everyone's all fired up and like, okay, what about 711, what about
02:14:29.92 --> 02:14:35.52 AMP and what it look, well, that's what that's the goal. Like I said, Florida's a little bit of a battleground state.
02:14:37.12 --> 02:14:42.56 So we hope, you know, when you you're hoping, but people in Florida will get after it.
02:14:42.56 --> 02:14:46.72 Yeah, fully. Wait, is Jocco IT in a wall or just the discipline. Just the discipline.
02:14:46.72 --> 02:14:52.80 Yep. Yeah. Okay. Well, there you go. Boom. Also at originmain.com, you can get this stuff. Also at originmain.com.

02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:05.52 it be workout clothes, clothing shirts, but on top of that American made denim jeans.
02:15:05.52 --> 02:15:09.60 Also did you get new deltas? No, no, yeah. Okay. Did you get new deltas?
02:15:10.64 --> 02:15:21.76 Yeah. So the new deltas, they're freaking legit. And yeah, they're just the old deltas. I thought
02:15:21.76 --> 02:15:27.12 with the best thing that you could put on your legs. But now the new deltas, which if you're ordering
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:32.24 deltas now, they're the new deltas. And they're freaking the best thing ever. And they're what? They're kind of,
02:15:32.24 --> 02:15:40.08 um, like stretchy-ish. I mean, they say they do have, they do have stretch to them. That way,
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:48.40 when you throw that full fantasy roundhouse kick. You're good. You're not ripping your pants.
02:15:48.40 --> 02:15:55.68 Yeah, that's good. For sure. Okay. Well, then you have it full fantasy stuff. Um, yeah, Jeanne's boots.
02:15:55.68 --> 02:16:01.44 All American made stuff. These are big deal. And, and I think we all know that and we all know why.
02:16:01.44 --> 02:16:08.88 Also, we have our own store. Yeah, I said it. I said what I said. All right. It's still jocquist store.
02:16:08.88 --> 02:16:13.60 So that thing, what you just said, I said what I said, you know, that's kind of a thing too, right?
02:16:13.60 --> 02:16:19.28 From, I, yeah, I don't know. Okay, what's the other thing? My daughters are saying. Okay. All their
02:16:19.28 --> 02:16:22.56 daughter. I like that one. I think it's very fun. Delby. I said what I said.
02:16:22.56 --> 02:16:29.60 Yeah. Yeah. There is this joke, like, you know, the name of the memes online. Yeah.
02:16:29.60 --> 02:16:35.12 There's this joke that it was like, I forget even the joke, but it was, it was really funny. And
02:16:35.12 --> 02:16:40.72 since since then, I started to appreciate memes. Oh, yeah. I appreciate memes. And I even appreciate
02:16:40.72 --> 02:16:47.28 people that have, you know, like a hat that says veteran of the meme wars and they have,
02:16:47.28 --> 02:16:50.96 they've awarded, they've been awarded whatever award you get for the meme. Maybe they got a name.
02:16:51.76 --> 02:17:00.64 We're five, five names. Spot names. So yeah. The memes are good. Yes. But somehow, I don't,
02:17:01.92 --> 02:17:07.20 the memes don't float in me. It's always my son that shows me memes. Yeah. I don't know what the hell
02:17:07.20 --> 02:17:13.44 he subscribes to. Oh, is it some cram as you call it? But he shows me some memes that are funny.
02:17:13.44 --> 02:17:17.60 Yeah. They're really funny. Yeah. Whoever's making their smart people, like, you know,
02:17:17.60 --> 02:17:22.48 how you can, you know, some jokes are like, brother, that's like not even a, it's like a cheap
02:17:22.48 --> 02:17:26.64 joke that's not funny. And then somewhere like you got to be, whoever thought of that made that
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:31.92 joke up is like a smart, funny person. Right. You know, like there's some impressive stuff on
02:17:31.92 --> 02:17:39.04 their frill. Like I inadvertently, well, or inadvertently, whatever, subscribe to like a bunch of them.
02:17:39.04 --> 02:17:46.24 That's really good. Yeah. Full grown man fully memes all day. But yes, I said what I said,
02:17:47.20 --> 02:17:52.96 it's our store. Okay. Still called Jockel store. So anyway, yes, Jockel store. This where you can
02:17:52.96 --> 02:17:58.88 represent with clothing, t-shirts, hoodies, discipline equals freedom. Good, all this stuff. Here's
02:17:58.88 --> 02:18:05.52 the thing. I said this last week, I'm saying it again. It's a big deal. We have a t-shirt club.
02:18:06.72 --> 02:18:11.36 Okay. So this is what the t-shirt club kind it is. It's like, okay, look. The t-shirt club is
02:18:12.16 --> 02:18:17.52 echo coming up with a lot of different t-shirts and me saying dude, we can't make a million
02:18:17.52 --> 02:18:21.76 different t-shirts because how are we going to keep a million different t-shirts
02:18:21.76 --> 02:18:29.20 in stock and how many and all that stuff. Yeah. And then you come up with a big creative.
02:18:31.20 --> 02:18:35.84 Yes, that. Well, you know, I guess it depends on you. You had the
02:18:35.84 --> 02:18:41.04 end state in mind. Yeah. Right. You figured out way to solve that problem. Well, I think it's good
02:18:41.04 --> 02:18:47.52 because also on top of that, which, um, yes, that's true. But on top of it, it's like sometimes
02:18:47.52 --> 02:18:52.40 we like, like, even you'll be like, hey, put this on a t-shirt or I'll be like, you know, like suggesting,
02:18:52.40 --> 02:18:58.48 like a t-shirt and it's a good, it's a fun, good idea or cool or cool. Because that's face that you
02:18:58.48 --> 02:19:03.76 come up with ideas for t-shirts that are fun and I come up with ideas for t-shirts that are cool.
02:19:03.76 --> 02:19:09.12 Oh yeah. Super cool. Extra cool. Are you done? Are you denying about that? No, no, no, no.
02:19:09.12 --> 02:19:15.76 Oh, good. It's true. It's 100% true, actually. But we can't just start like you said, just throwing
02:19:15.76 --> 02:19:21.04 these shirts on like or whatever, but the idea of, you know, so these ideas for shirts that they,
02:19:21.04 --> 02:19:25.84 they're doable. Also people, the people always say, can you make this t-shirt, can you make that
02:19:25.84 --> 02:19:29.92 t-shirt? That'd be a cool t-shirt. Yeah. And there's some that I'm like, that are shirts that we talk
02:19:29.92 --> 02:19:33.76 about. And then someone, you should do this shirt. But like, yeah, we just talked about that kind of thing,
02:19:33.76 --> 02:19:38.64 you know. So it's like all these ideas, hey, we'll throw it in one month. We'll have it, you know,
02:19:38.64 --> 02:19:44.72 you can have it. And it just goes on and on. It's good. A little subscription situation. Anyway,
02:19:44.72 --> 02:19:52.64 it's good t-shirt. Well, fun. Okay. So because you're kind of kind of just giving me a look,
02:19:52.64 --> 02:19:58.96 when I said I come up with cool t-shirt ideas, I'm going to say one, that will be available
02:19:58.96 --> 02:20:08.56 through the t-shirt. What is it subscription? Sure. Yeah. So here's one. podcast number 53.
02:20:08.56 --> 02:20:12.96 There's one part. This is the chosen Rev. Reservoir. We're talking about the book,
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:19.76 colder than hell. And there's one point where the Marines are fighting for their lives.
02:20:20.80 --> 02:20:26.32 And there are assaulting down a hill. And there's a guy that guy that's writing the book is
02:20:26.32 --> 02:20:30.80 writing what he's seeing. And he sees these guys getting up and charging in one of the Marines
02:20:31.36 --> 02:20:37.60 is not holding a gun. He's holding a freaking axe. And he's charging at the Chinese communist
02:20:37.60 --> 02:20:46.48 mess and assaults their position. And so that's what I want to put it on a t-shirt. A silhouette,
02:20:46.48 --> 02:20:54.80 somehow of a crazy picture where you can tell that there is a Marine with an axe running down
02:20:54.80 --> 02:20:59.52 a sulting a communist position. And all I'm going to say is on that is like,
