00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 18, with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.000 Good evening, echo. Good evening. He who fights with monsters should be careful,
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000 less he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into the abyss, the abyss,
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:48.000 we'll also gaze into thee. So said Nietzsche. And that is really what we're dealing with here in the world.
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:04.000 In my world, fighting. Fighting against monsters. And I'm talking about what goes on not only
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000 the outside world and the evil that's there, but also in the world around us and also inside your head,
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:24.000 inside my head, there's battles, battles that can be raging every minute of the day,
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000 between strength and weakness, between the past and the future, between good and evil,
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000 between light and dark, opposing forces battling against each other.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000 And we all see evil. I mean, of course, there's those of us that have been to war,
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:58.000 where we see concentrated evil, but evil's everywhere around us, around everyone, disease and crime and
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:14.000 murder and abuse and loss. And there's predators out there. And there's prey in nature and in humans.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000 And as I've said before, there's parts of the world where we've built a nice bubble,
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000 where we can all but remove the evil, or at least distance ourselves from it.
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000 And in doing so, we can almost, almost forget about it, almost.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.000 But it's a thin, thin veneer, and it doesn't take much to release the demons.
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000 It doesn't take much for humanity to fall apart. And that shows itself often in war,
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:17.000 which is one of those things that can very quickly release the demons.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000 There are dead soldiers, dead women, dead children. Everyone's dead.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000 Sure, and headed boys, sometimes morose, sometimes laughing, beaten up in our barracks with broken jaws and ruptured lungs.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000 We were herded into this war and killed by the hundred.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 We didn't even know how to shoot. We couldn't kill anyone. We didn't know how.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000 All that we were capable of was crying and dying. And die we did.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:01.000 We called the rebels uncle, and when our boys' throats were cut, they'd beg the rebels, please uncle, don't kill me.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000 What did I ever do to you?
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.000 We so wanted to live. Get that into your heads. You fat smug generals who sent us off to this slaughter.
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.000 We hadn't yet seen life or even tasted it's scent, but we had already seen death.
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000 We knew this smell of congealed blood and the floor of a helicopter and a hundred degree heat.
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000 New that the flesh of a torn-off leg turns black, and that a person can burn up entirely in lit gasoline, leaving just the bones.
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000 We knew that bodies swell up in the heat, and we listened to every night to the crazed dogs, howling in the ruins.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.000 Then we started to howl ourselves because to die at the age of 18 is terrifying.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000 We were betrayed by everyone, and we died in a manner befitting real cannon fodder, silently and unfairly.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000 By night they kick the living crap out of us, by day we unload corpses.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000 I have no dreams in this tent, and no charred bodies chase me at night.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:33.000 I just plunged into a dark pit, where there is nothing, not even war, and I open my eyes when it gets light.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000 A person changes very quickly in war. He may be scared by a dead body on the first day, but a week later,
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:53.000 he can be eating from a can while leaning on human remains to be more comfortable.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.000 That's a book we're diving into right now. It's called the One Soldier's War.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:12.000 By Arcadey Bob Chanko, he was a Russian soldier, fought in both wars in Cheshnean, the first and the second.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000 The Russians fought against the Cheshne rebels.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:30.000 This is actually a book that a bunch of people, after we did a short piece and talked about the war in Cheshnean, and the lessons learned from that war.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000 A bunch of people hit me on Twitter and said to check out this book and I did, and they were right.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000 It's a great narrative, and it shows you the impact of this war on the soldiers that fought in it.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000 Again, we are going to see the veil of humanity ripped off.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000 I think it's important first to kind of look at where these soldiers came from.
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000 Back to the book here, you won't find any smart handsome boys in these tents.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000 They were gotten out of the war by the rich daddies, leaving it to us ordinary folk to die in Grosny.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000 The ones who didn't have the money to pay are way out.
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000 Heaped in these tents are the sons of laborers, teachers, peasants, and blue collar workers.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:32.000 Basically, all of those who were made penniless by the government's thieves, heaving reforms, and then left to waste away.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:42.000 These tents contain the ones who didn't know how to give a bribe to the right person, who thought that the army service was the duty of every man.
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000 Truth and nobility of hearts are no longer virtues in our world.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:58.000 Those who believe in them are the first to die.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:10.000 Now, one thing that I'm about to get into is the treatment of the Russian soldiers, which is absolutely just gangster.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000 It's just gangster as the only way I can describe it.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000 The way that the soldiers were treated, the way that the military was run, was just by brute force within the own chain of command.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000 So there was no escape.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000 This is what they were dealing with.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000 So there's an unofficial set of rules, a kind of a code of laws, which evaluated in Cour-Corpel punishment.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000 If I stuck my hands in my pockets, I'd get a thumb on the head.
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000 That is the privilege of the older soldiers.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000 A spirit in a spirit is what they call the new soldiers. They call them spirits.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000 A spirit should forget about his pockets entirely.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000 Otherwise, they will fill them up with sand and sow them.
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000 The sand chafes the groin in two days later, you have weeping sores.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000 You can get a beating for anything at all.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000 If a spirit doesn't show respect in his conversation with an older soldier, a grandad, he'll get beaten up.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000 If he talks too loudly or goes about the barracks clattering his heels, he'll get beaten up.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000 If he lies on his bed in the day, he'll get beaten up.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000 If people back home, send him good rubber slippers and he decides to wear them to the shower, he'll get beaten up and lose those slippers.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000 If a spirit even thinks of turning down the tops of his boots or walking around with his top button,
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000 undonner if his cap is tipped back or on his head or one side, or he doesn't do his belt up tightly enough,
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000 they'll thrash him so hard, he'll forget his name. He is a spirit, the lowest dregs,
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000 and it is his job to slave until the older soldiers have been discharged.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:03.000 And then he goes on, that's sort of the basic military situation that they're in, and that he's raised in.
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000 And that sort of the garrison, meaning not the combat situation, but it's the garrison, the standard Russian situation if you're a soldier.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000 Now, here's the situation he's in.
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000 But there is none of this in our regimen. All of that stuff is just child's play. It's the big leagues here.
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000 I can walk how I like and where what I like and it doesn't bother anyone. They beat us for completely different reasons.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000 Our older conscripts have already killed people and buried their comrades, and they don't believe they'll survive this war themselves.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000 So beatings here are just the norm. Everyone is going to die anyway, both those doing the beating and their victims.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000 So what's the big deal? There's the runway, two steps from here, and they keep bringing back bodies by the dozen.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000 We'll all die here. Everybody beats everyone.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000 The dmbs, with three months of service to go, the officers, the war officers, they get stinking drunk and then hammer the ones below them.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000 Even the kernels beat the majors, the majors beat the lutenants, and they all beat the privates.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000 And the granddad's beat the new recruits.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000 No one talks to each other like human beings. They just smack each other in the mouth because it's easier that way.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Quicker and simpler to understand.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000 Because you're all going to bite it anyway so you bitch is because there are unfed children back home,
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000 because the officer corps is adored with impoverishment and hopelessness. Because a dml has three months left.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:50.000 Because every second man is shell-shocked because our mother-in-law makes us kill our own people, our own people who speak Russian.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000 And we have to shoot them in the head and send their brains flying up walls, crush them with tanks and tear them to pieces.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000 Because these people want to kill you because your soldiers arrived yesterday straight from training,
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000 and today they are already lying open on the air strip as lumped lumps of charred flesh and flies lay eggs in their open eyes.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.000 And because in a day the company is reduced to less than a third and God willing you'll stay among that third.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000 Because the one thing that everyone knows is how to get drunk and kill, kill and kill some more.
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:35.000 Because a soldier is a stinking wretch and a spirit doesn't have any right to live at all, and to beat him is actually to do him a favor.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000 I'll teach you what war is about you, Prix.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.000 You can have a smack in a mouth so you don't think life is too rosy and thank your mother that she didn't have you six months earlier, or you'd all be dead now.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000 Everyone hates everyone else in this regimen. The hatred and madness hang over the square like a flower black cloud.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000 And this cloud saturates young boys with fear, just like pieces of barbecue meat being marinated in lemon juice.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000 Only they get stewed and fear and hatred before they get sent off to the meat grinder.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000 It will be easy, it will be easier for us to die there.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:39.000 So you've got some, you know, the things with the things you hear me talking about all the time, the camaraderie, the the spree, decor, the brotherhood, all of it's just gone.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:53.000 Now you're going to get to a point and he does get to it where you get to the front line troopers when they're fighting and they rely on each other and they have the normal soldierly brotherly comrade love for each other.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000 But as a unit throughout the ranks, you can see it's it's it's awful.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000 And this is before we even get to the fighting.
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000 Yeah, cove love vanished toward evening.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000 He wasn't the first to go missing.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:24.000 A couple of weeks earlier, two soldiers from the 8th company had taken a machine gun and tried to go home.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000 No one looked for your cove love.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000 The storming of grass and he was underway and second battalion tried in vain for the third day to take the cross shaped hospital, suffering high casualties.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000 And we were bogged down for the third day at the first row of houses in the private district.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000 The storming operation was faltering and we didn't have time to look.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:54.000 They listed him as a deserter, road office rifle, as lost in combat and closed the case.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:01.000 It was the Oman and this is like there are sort of a special police unit that they had within the military.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Oman, it was the Oman who turned up our missing man during the night while they were mopping up in the first line.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000 In one cottage cellar, they found a mutilated body.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 The rebels had slid him open like a tin of meat.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000 Pulled out his intestines and used them to strangle him while he was still alive.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:40.000 On the neatly white washed walls above him, written in his blood where the words, alachbar, God is great.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:50.000 So now you get a little bit from the enemy and we already talked about the abuse and now we're going to get into some blue on blue.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000 Some fractures side.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000 Half an hour later we got sheld by self-propelled guns.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000 I'm standing in the street with a company commander when the first house on the right suddenly shutters and start to collapse in the center.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000 A huge split spreads down from the ninth floor.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000 Balcanese girders and floor supports spew out and seemed to hover in the air, turn over and then drive themselves into ground with a thud.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000 Small debris scatters into the yard after the heavy blocks.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000 We don't know what's happening and squat down instinctively, crawl behind a rusty, shrapnel-riddled garage and look all around us.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000 Then we realize that it's friendly fire.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000 The company commander fumbles for the headphone of the radio on my back and starts to call the Battalion commander.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000 I crawl over to the spare radio that's standing on open ground with the commander scrambling after me, still wearing the headphones.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000 One after the other, him standing over my head and me crouch between his legs, we shout into the mouthpiece for them to cease firing.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000 Tangled up in the wires and the headphones, we forget all about the shrapnel.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000 All we can think about is reporting that we are here and they should hold chilling.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000 That we must stop them from hitting our guys.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000 Our infantrymen pour out of the house and stand dumbstruck on the porch is not knowing where to run.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000 Huge 150 millimeter shells weighing more than 60 pounds wore through the air.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:27.000 Above us and blow up the upper floors, one blast erupts a whole vertical section of the building vanishes, leaving just rusty steel entrails,
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000 Judging from the shattered walls.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Another shell flies down the middle of the yard and hits the house on the left before it explodes.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000 Time loses meaning. We lie behind the garage, pressing ourselves into the snow.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000 How long this lasts, I have no idea.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Finally, it's over.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:00.000 With two seriously wounded, the shell that flew down the middle of the yard exploded right inside their headquarters while two men were there.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000 The leg and one side of them was blown to pieces and the other had both legs torn off.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000 Again, we run the wounded to the carrier on stretchers and load them inside.
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.000 Again, they make no sound except for when one opens his eyes and says quietly, get my leg.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:32.000 Side G picks up the severed remnants of the leg and carries it up along beside the stretcher, five of them carry him in pieces, foretaking his torso and one his leg.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000 They load him into the carrier, the limb is placed inside behind him.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000 The other wounded man dies.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000 Some insight here. I think this is striking.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:58.000 I remember when you're a kid, you grow up, you watch war movies, you watch war documentaries, you watch a world war two films and they're all black and white.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000 Sometimes people think that war is black and white, because that's what you see.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000 And he thought the same thing, and here he is, I always used to think that war was black and white, but it's in color.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000 It's not true what the song says, that birds don't sing and trees don't grow in war.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:30.000 In fact, people get killed in the midst of such vivid color, among the green foliage of the trees under the clear blue sky.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:47.000 And life homes on all around, the birds brim with song, the grass blooms with brightly colored flowers, dead people lie in the grass, and they are not a bit scary in appearance as part of this multi-colored world.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000 You can laugh and chat alongside them, humanity doesn't freeze and go crazy at the sight of a body.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000 It's only frightening when people shoot at you.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000 And it's very frightening that war is in color.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000 Talking about some of the civilians, especially the mothers.
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000 The mothers have it worst of all in this war.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000 They don't belong to either side.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000 They get brushed off from the Russian generals or our soldiers shoot at them.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:33.000 And as one priest, we freed from captivity told me, the cheshens take them off into the mountains and rape them, kill them, and feed their innards to their dogs.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000 They've been betrayed by everyone, these Russian women.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000 They die by the dozen.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:51.000 Yet still, they wander around Cheshania with their photos searching for their sons.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000 And what's happening to the sons?
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000 Here's what's happening to the sons.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000 Then the cheshens start killing our guys they took prisoner.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:13.000 They shout from the end of the street to get our attention and show a few soldiers, badly beaten, and with their hands tied behind their backs.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000 The cheshens laugh and shout something at us in their language, and then quickly put one of the prisoners on his side on the asphalt.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Pin his head with a foot and stab and twice in the throat with a knife.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000 The boy jerks his tied hands and wimpers, and a black trickle spreads from his slash throat onto the road.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000 The cheshens go back around the corner, leaving him to die on the asphalt.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000 He lies a long time on his side without moving, and then he starts to twitch.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000 He jerks his bound hands and tries to turn over as if he's uncomfortable.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000 Then he falls quite again.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:08.000 It is painful for him to move, and he obediently lies on his side with a gaping throat that keeps pumping a black trickle.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000 When we think he's already dead, he starts to twitch again and tries to crawl, then goes still again.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000 This goes on a long time, blood pours from his throat, and smears across his face.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:31.000 His jacket is slipped down to his elbows, and when he jerks his arms, blood spurts from an artery onto his bear shoulder.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:41.000 Bastards says, murky, unable to bear any longer, he jumps up and shouts over the buildings, just kill him, you fuckers, shoot him, you bastards, bastards.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000 He unslings his rifle, but Osepaul then loop managed to grab the barrel.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000 They grip his arms and press him to the ground.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:23:01.000 Murky squats, holding his head in his hands and moaning, bastards, bastards, bastards he whimpered whispers.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000 The boy soon starts to choke, he can't breathe and blood sprays from his mouth as he coughs.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:19.000 Sometimes he loses consciousness for a while and lies motionless, then he comes to and once again tries to crawl.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000 When he stops moving all together, the chush and shoot him in the back with tracer rounds.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000 The bullets pass through his body and ricochet into the sky.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000 They also killed a rest of the prisoners.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000 This time they don't appear from around the corner, all we hear are screams.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000 Before they cut each boy's throat, they shout, alok bar.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:54.000 We hear this several times and an hour later, they throw the bodies out into the street.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000 Savodry.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:13.000 And unfortunately, savodry breeds more savodry than the downward spiral of sadism.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000 And in humanity.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000 Meanwhile, stories of horrors elsewhere in Cheshnie are kept filtering back to us.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000 A friend of mine told me how his battalion entered some village or another.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:42.000 It didn't get sheldt much and was almost intact, but around the main square, where large crosses upon which Russian soldiers had been crucified.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000 They'd been nailed up by their hands and each had a few bullet holes in his chest.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000 They had all been castrated.
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000 The commander ordered them to do a sweep through the village.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000 All the men who could be found were heard it up into the square.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000 They were thrown down in piles and our soldiers started to hack them up.
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:19.000 One guy pinned a chest into the ground with his foot, while another pulled off his pants, and with two or three hefty slashes severed his scrotum.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000 The serrated blade of the knife snagged the skin and pulled the blood vessels from his body.
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000 In half a day, the whole village was castrated.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:43.000 Then the battalion moved out. Our dead men remained on the crosses.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:54.000 As I said, savagery breeds more savagery.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:16.000 Here's one of the worst parts. I think this is one of the worst parts psychologically for this soldier, for our Katie, and many of the soldiers that were fighting alongside him.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000 We don't know what we are fighting for.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000 We have no goal, no morals, or internal justification for what we do.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000 We are sent off to kill and to meet our deaths, but we don't know why.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000 We just drew the short straw, happened to be born 18 years ago, and grew up just in time for this war.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000 And our blame ends there.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:55.000 The only thing we have is hope that we will survive and preserve our sense of self and be able to remain human beings.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000 We all feel the adjusted of it all.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000 We feel the injustice of it all so acutely with our 18 years.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:13.000 Each one of us that survives this war will truly believe that such evil should never happen again.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000 Every shell that hit us tore apart both the flesh and the soul.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:29.000 Our whole outlook on life crumbled in collapse beneath this demonic fire, and there was nothing to fill the emptiness in it.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000 The only thing we have left is ourselves and our brothers and arms.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000 All we know of life is death.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000 If anyone ever asks me what were you fighting for, I will reply for those who clung to the ground next to me.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000 We fought only for each other.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000 Our entire generation may have died in Cheshnia, a whole generation of Russians.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:07.000 Even those of us who stayed alive, can they really be those same 18 year old laughing boys who once got seen off to the army by their loved ones?
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000 No.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000 We died.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000 We all died in that war.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.000 Now, there's a point where our K to the author, he's there under fire.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:41.000 Obviously, he's feeling the pressure of being under fire, and there's a sniper.
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000 He thinks he knows where the sniper is, but he's not 100% sure.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000 He just kind of thinks, hey, I think I saw something and he calls for fire.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000 The words he directs, heavy cannons from some armored vehicles towards that fire.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:15.000 And the next day or two days later, he finds out that what happened to the people that were killed in that was like an eight year old or a nine year old girl, and her grandfather.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000 And so here's his thoughts on that.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000 Yesterday, I murdered a girl.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000 I suddenly felt sick, and there was nothing I could do about it.
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000 There was nowhere to go and beg forgiveness.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000 I had murdered them, and it was irrevocable.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000 Now I would be a child killer my whole life, and I'd have to live with this.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:54.000 Eat drink, raise children, be happy, and sad, laugh, and cry, be ill, love, and kiss Olga.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000 Touch this pure radiant creation with hands that had murdered.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000 Touch her face, eyes, lips, breasts so tender and vulnerable, and leave greasy traces of death on her clear skin.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000 These hands, these damned hands, I should cut them off and discard them.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000 I will never get them clean now.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000 I stuck my hands between my knees and started to rub them on my pant legs.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000 I understood that this was psychosis, madness, but I couldn't help it.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:35.000 It seemed to my hands had become sticky, like when you've eaten food in a dirty cafe under the sun.
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:49.000 Murder had stuck to them, the violest kind of murder, and I couldn't get it off.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:58.000 The next day he's in the chow hall, they're eating, and one of his buddies hands him attend with some oatmeal in it.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000 Here, eat this, we saved it for you.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000 Thanks, I took the tin and absolutely started to wolf down the cold oatmeal.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Then I stopped.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000 Remember how the cheshians hit us yesterday?
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000 You know what? It turns out we killed a girl when we fired back, an eight-year-old girl and her grandfather.
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And here's the response from Olga.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000 It happens.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000 Don't think about it, it'll pass.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000 If you're going to put yourself through hell every time it happens, you'll go out of your mind.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000 People hear kill and get killed.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000 They kill us, we kill them.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000 I've killed too.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000 It's just war.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000 Our own lives aren't worth a thing here, let alone someone else's.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000 Don't think about it, at least not until you get home.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000 Right now you're still too close to her.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000 She's dead and you're alive, but you're both still rotting in one place.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000 Only she's below ground and you're above it.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000 And the difference between you may only be one day.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000 Now going to another little section where they've gone into a place called Argonne.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000 And they've got a pretty secure perimeter in an old factory.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000 We are halted for the fourth day in a row at the Canning Factory in Argonne.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:34.000 It's the best place we've been so far during our deployment and we feel completely safe inside the fence that skirts the perimeter.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:43.000 The trouble with this war is that we are in a permanent state of encirclement and can expect to be shot in the back at any moment.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 But here we are sheltered.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000 We relax.
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000 April has arrived in the sun has already beating down.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000 We rock around practically naked, wearing only our cut-off long johns and army boots.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000 And we are alike as brothers.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000 And brothers we are.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000 For there's no one in the world closer than emaciated soldiers with light-bitten arm pits, sun brown necks,
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000 and otherwise white-butrefined skin.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000 While he's there he's reflecting on some of the things he's seen.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000 And he says, I remember the photo we found near Shatoy of the little Cheshien boy.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000 He's only about seven, but he's showing off with a rifle in his hands while his mom stands alongside,
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000 beaming her little grown-up son.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000 How proud she is of him, so full of joy for the holy warrior who already knows how to hold the rifle.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:56.000 There will be even greater pride in her eyes when he severs the head of his first Russian prisoner at the age of 17.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000 At 20 he'll attack a column and kill more people, and at 22 he'll run his own slave camp.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000 Then at 25 they will hunt him down from a helicopter like a wolf.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:16.000 Flush him into the open and fire rockets at him as he darts between shell craters splattering his guts all over the place.
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:22.000 Then he'll lie in a puddle and stare at the sky with half open lifeless eyes,
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.000 now nothing more than an object of disgust as the ice crawlin to his beard.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000 We've seen warriors like this grown up from such boys, from cubs into wolves.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.000 And to think my mother would have flayed the skin from my back with a belt if I'd ever thought to pose with a weapon when I was a kid.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000 Enough.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000 No sense in dwelling on this now.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000 Later.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000 Everything later.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:11.000 So we kind of talked about the suffering that they abuse that they're taking from their own military leadership.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:18.000 We talked about the friendly fire situation, the hard and enemy that gets raised to fight.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:26.000 And on top of all that there's nature and disease that they have to deal with.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000 My bleeding starts again and my long johns are permanently encrusted with blood.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000 We all have it.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000 Your rectum swells up and protrudes out several centimeters.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000 Half your backside hangs out and you sit resplendent like a scarlet flower.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000 Where are we where are we supposed to find wiping material?
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.000 We strip the remaining scraps of wallpaper from the store rooms and rasp at our poor back sides,
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000 inflicting further harm on ourselves and sending blood gushing from our pants.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000 War is not just attacks, trenches, firefights and grenades.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000 It's also blood and feces running down your rotting legs.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000 It's starvation, lice and drunken madness.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000 It's swearing and human debasement.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000 It's an inhuman stench and clouds of flies circling over our battalion.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:35.000 And as time goes on, he's sort of starting to feel like the end of the war,
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:45.000 and he's going to come which starts to actually intensify the fear for him.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000 I live with fear constantly now.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000 He began that day and doesn't abate.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000 I'm scared all the time.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:02.000 The fear alternately turns slowly like a worm somewhere below my stomach or floods through me with a hot flush of sweat.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000 This is not the tension I experienced in the mountains, but pure animal fear.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000 I can no longer sleep.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000 I don't trust the centuries and spend most nights in the admin building or on the parade ground.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000 I always keep my chest harness stuffed with loaded magazines that I've traded for food and cigarettes.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000 I have about 25 magazines and still seems too few.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000 I also empty a few clips of bullets into my pockets and hang about a dozen grenades from my belt.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000 It's still not enough.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 If they storm us, I want to be fully armed.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000 And that's how he kind of finishes out in that complete state of fear.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000 And then it's over.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000 The battalion leaves for where we are to be discharged for us the war is over.
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000 It starts to rain.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:14.000 The tires of the vehicles squeal on the wet asphalt and rainbow is glimmer in the spray thrown up by the wheels.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.000 I open the hatch and stick my face out under the rain. Large drops fall straight and evenly on my skin.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:28.000 The sun hangs heavily on the horizon and our column casts long shadows in its rays.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000 And that's it.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000 Peace.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000 This warm damp day is the last day of our war.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000 The ship is dead and so many others.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000 I remember all of my comrades.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000 I remember their faces, their names.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000 At last we have peace boys.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000 We waited so long for it, didn't we?
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:07.000 We so wanted to meet it together to go home and not part company until the whole platoon had been to everyone else's home.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000 And even after that we would stay together, stay together, live as one community always close, always there for each other.
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000 What will I do without you?
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:28.000 You are my brothers, given to me by the war and we shouldn't be separated.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000 We'll always be together.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000 We still have our whole lives ahead of us.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Now, as we hear a lot about these days, the war ended, but it wasn't over.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000 It wasn't over for these guys.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:40:01.000 And at this point, our Katie is now back in the city.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000 And he's talking, he's walking around and he's dealing with people.
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:17.000 And you're going to see here, he meets up with some other veterans, wounded veterans that are basically on the street.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000 About a million military personnel passed through Cheshnean the 10 years after the start of the first war in 1994.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000 That's the population of a large city.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:39.000 Fifty divisions of seasoned soldiers who bring their philosophy, the philosophy of war back to civilian life with them when they return.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:50.000 At the age of 18, they had already killed men who were sometimes older than their fathers and saw how these grown men died from the bullets unleashed by their hands.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000 There were no voices of authority and there was no God either.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000 They were ready for anything.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000 There were no women in their world, no children, no old men, no sick people, no cripples.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000 There were just goals, dangerous ones, safe ones, and ones with potential.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:21.000 Three of them, meaning three of the veterans, three of them meet and sit in the subway near my metro station every morning.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000 They have five medals between them.
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Six crutches, two artificial limbs, and one leg, and a common hatred for the whole world.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:42.000 They've been coming here for a few years now to sing songs, and they are always the same songs in the same order.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000 They sing terribly, but that doesn't bother them.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000 They hate the people they are singing for.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:00.000 They see the world from below, and not just because they only have half their bodies left, but because half of their souls are gone too.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000 They're closer to the spit-drenched asphalt than the people's faces.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000 They no longer have the strength to get up and start a new life on plastic legs and no longer wish to.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000 These young men don't want to try to keep up with life anymore.
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000 All they want is for the war to last forever, and for them to be a part of it.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:32.000 For furnishings, one of them brought a small travel rug, a small kitchen cushion to sit on, and to take player.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000 When two of his comrades leave, he stays there on his own.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000 I don't know his name, and it doesn't matter. He is my brother. They all are.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000 Others given to me by the war. The whole of Moscow is filled with such brothers.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000 There's at least one in each subway. He spoke first.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000 Where did you fight then, brother? I told him. Then he started to remember stuff.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:09.000 Where, when, how, he told me about getting his leg torn off when his carrier got ambushed.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000 A shell hit the armor by his right hip. He didn't lose consciousness, and he even saw his ripped off leg jerking,
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:24.000 and the boots scraping on the rivets. I didn't ask him anything. Just listened in silence.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000 And he calmly spoke, and without any hysterics, just discussing life.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000 I don't understand this world. These people. Why are they alive? What for?
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000 They were given life at birth and didn't have to pry it away from death. Have a good life, people.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000 But how do they spend it? Do they want to invent a cure for AIDS and build the world's most beautiful bridge,
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000 or make everyone happy? No. They want to rip everyone off.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000 Stash away as much money as they can, and that's it. So many boys died. Real kids.
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000 And these people hear Fridder their lives away as ignorally as a kitten playing with a ball,
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000 and have no idea why they are alive. Pointless people. A whole world full of pointless people.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000 A lost generation. And it's not we who are the lost generation.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000 It's them. Those who didn't fight. They are.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:35.000 If their deaths could bring back just one of those boys, then I'd kill all of them without hesitation.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:41.000 Every single one of them is my personal enemy.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:48.000 He lights a new cigarette from the stub of his last and pours a fresh shot of vodka.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000 And then he laughs evenly, and his eyes flash with hatred.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000 You can't go on enjoying yourself while two hours flight away. People are killing each other.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000 Children are still dying, and there's starvation, and yet those people are willing to pay 700 rubles for a theater ticket.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000 That's 2000 for the family, just to amuse themselves. You can live for two months and chestening on that money.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000 I must be concussed because I don't understand this. I just can't get my head around it.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000 There's a war going on in their country, and they don't give a damn.
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000 So in that case, why shouldn't give a damn about them, either?
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:37.000 Not one of them should ever die without knowing what war is.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:44.000 I want for them to to cry out at night, and cry in their sleep, and without waking to dive under the bed
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.000 when the New Year's Eve's fireworks are exploding in the yard, and wine there from terror like we did.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000 There's guilty of our deaths as those who killed us, who sent us to the slaughter.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000 Why weren't they striking in Moscow and blocking the roads when we were being killed in Grosni? Why?
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:12.000 Why weren't they screaming and tearing their hair out when they saw on TV how dogs fed off the flesh of their boys?
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.000 Why was there no revolution uprising or civil unrest?
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000 How could they send their sons off to this slaughter?
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:28.000 And then go and have fun live, drink beer and earn money while they were dying down there.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:36.000 While jets were flattening the mountains and tearing apart children and women when wounded, chest and kids, rotted in sellers,
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:43.000 wrapping the stumps of their limbs in rags and infection crept across the wounds.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000 There are also guilty of these deaths.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:54.000 We are here to get what's ours and we are ready to kill.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000 His hatred abates as suddenly as it had welled over.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:05.000 His eyes recede once again behind a film of indifference.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000 Half truths everywhere, half sincerity, half friendship.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000 I can't accept that.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000 Here in civilian life, they only have half truths.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000 The small measure of truth we had in war was a big lie.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000 So many boys died and eyes survived.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000 The whole time I used to wonder what for?
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000 They were better than I was.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000 But I survived. Surely this is not by pure chance.
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000 Maybe I lived so that others remember us.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000 I am a reminder. He says,
00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:04.000 It's obviously a...
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000 You know, this is this is psychological damage.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:16.000 And this is someone that is still reeling from the war.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.000 And I can tell you, when I came home from my last appointment,
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000 I didn't feel like that.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000 But I understand what he's talking about when I came home from my last appointment
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000 and knowing what great sacrifices Americans were making overseason,
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000 including my friends.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:43.000 I remember walking around town and just looking at people.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:50.000 It is difficult to make that transition mentally back to where people care about the stupidest things.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:58.000 And they're complaining about things that are just no human being should ever be given the right to complain about.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000 And as that individual right there was saying,
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000 kind of what I say, what are you doing with your life?
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000 What are you doing with your life?
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000 Because people have paid dearly to give you that freedom.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000 So what are you doing with it?
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000 And now we get the author's view.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:33.000 And you can kind of hear his struggle as well.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:39.000 No one returns from the war ever.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000 Mother's get back a sad semblance of their sons.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.000 Embedded, aggressive beasts hardened against the whole world and believing in nothing except death.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000 Yesterday soldiers are no longer belong to their parents.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000 They belong to war.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000 And only their body returns from the war.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000 Their soul stays there.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000 But the body still comes home.
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000 And the war within it dies gradually, shedding itself in layers, scale by scale.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:32.000 Slowly, very slowly, yesterday's soldier, sergeant, or captain transforms from a soulless dummy with empty eyes and a burned out soul into something like a human being.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000 The unbearable nervous tension adds away.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000 The aggression simmers down.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000 The hatred passes.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000 The loneliness abates.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000 It's the fear that lingers longest of all.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000 An animal fear of death.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000 But that too passes with time.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000 And you start to learn to live this life again.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000 You learn to walk without checking the ground beneath your feet for mines and trip wires and step on manholes on the road without fear.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000 And stand at your full height in the open ground.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000 And you go shopping, talk on the phone, and sleep on a bed.
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:25.000 You learn to take for granted the hot water and the taps, the electricity, and the central heating.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000 You no longer jump at loud noises.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000 You start to live at first because that's how it's worked out.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And you've stayed alive.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000 You do it without gaining much joy from life.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000 You look at everything as a windfall that came your way through some whim of fate.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.000 You live your life from cover to cover.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000 In those 180 days you were there.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:59.000 And the remaining 50 odd years can't add anything to that time or detract from it.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000 Then you start to get drawn into life.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000 You get interested in this game, which isn't for real.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000 You pass yourself off as a fully fledged member of society.
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:16.000 And the mask of a normal person grows onto you no longer rejected by your body.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.000 And those around you think you are just the same as everyone else.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.000 But no one knows your real face.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000 And no one knows that you are no longer a person.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000 Happy laughing people walk around you, accepting you as one of their own.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000 And no one knows where you've been.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000 But that doesn't bother you anymore.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:47.000 You now remember the war is some cartoon horror movie you once saw.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000 But you no longer recognize yourself as one of its characters.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 You don't tell anyone the truth anymore.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000 You can't explain what war really is to someone who's never been there.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000 Just as you can't explain green to a blind person.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000 Or a man can't know what it's like to give birth.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:10.000 They simply don't have the necessary sensory organs.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000 You can't explain or understand war.
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000 All you can do is experience it.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000 You're still waiting for something all these years.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000 God knows what though.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000 You simply can't believe that it ends just like that without any consequences.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000 You're probably waiting for someone to shed some light on it all.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000 For someone to come up to you and say,
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Brother, I know where you've been.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000 I know what war is.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000 And I know what you've been fighting for.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000 That's very important to know why and what for.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000 Why the brothers the war gave to you had to die.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 Why people were killed.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000 Why they were fired on.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Goodwill, justice, faith and love.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000 Crushed children and bombed women.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000 Why the world need to lose that girl I saw on the runway with her smashed head.
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000 And a bit of her brain lying in an ammo box next to her.
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000 Why?
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000 But no one tells you.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000 And then you yesterday's soldier, sergeant,
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000 or captain start to explain it to yourself.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:29.000 You take a pen and paper and produce the first phrase as you start to write.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000 You still don't know what it'll be.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000 Or short story or a poem or a song.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000 The lines come with difficulty.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Each letter tearing your body like a shard being pulled from a wound.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000 You feel this pain physically as the war comes out of you.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000 And on the paper shaking you so that you can't see the letters.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000 You are back there again and death wants more rules everything.
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000 The room fills with mowning and fear.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000 And once again you hear the big guns, the screams of the wounded,
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000 and people being burned alive.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000 And the whistle of mortar shells falling towards your prone back.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000 The dead rise from their graves and form up.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.000 A great number of them, everyone who is dear to you and was killed.
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000 You can already spot that familiar faces.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000 Igor, Vaseline, four eyes, the platoon commander.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000 They lean towards you and whisper.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.000 And their whispering fills the room.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000 Go on, brother.
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000 Tell them how we burned in the carriers.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000 Tell them how we cried in surrounded checkpoints in August of 1996.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000 How we whimpered and begged them not to kill us as they pinned us to the ground with their feet and slid our
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000 fruits.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000 Tell them how boys bodies twitch when bullets hit them.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000 You survived only because we died there.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000 Go on, they should know all this.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000 No one should die before they know what war is.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000 And tinge with blood.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000 The written words appear one after the other.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:20.000 vodka is downed by the pint while death and madness sit behind you, nudging you and correcting your pen.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000 And there you are.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000 Yesterday's soldier, sergeant, or captain,
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:36.000 concussed a hundred times, shot to pieces, patched up, reassembled half crazed and stupified.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000 And you write and write and whine with helplessness and sorrow.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:48.000 And tears poured out of your face and stick into your stubble.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000 And you realize.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000 That you should not have returned from the war.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000 And that is.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000 Where the book closes.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And those are the demons.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000 Those are the demons.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Why did I survive?
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Why not them?
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000 What about the innocence we killed?
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 Am I good for anything else besides war?
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:47.000 And it's not just war.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000 That brings out demons.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Life does.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000 Stress, and mayhem, and accidents, and crime,
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000 and madness, and loss.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000 Those are demons.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000 That attack, that attack your soul.
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000 And there's a saying, and it's something like,
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:31.000 if I kill all my demons, then my angels, they die too.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:38.000 And I say, no.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000 I say, do not kill your demons.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.000 Instead understand them.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000 Know them.
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000 It's one of the oldest tenants of war.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:02.000 You have to know your enemy so you can defeat your enemy.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000 And the best trick the devil can play is to make you think he's not there.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000 And that's what these demons do.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000 They hide deep.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000 They pick away at you and they set up on you.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000 But don't pretend that the demons aren't there.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000 You have to understand them.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000 Bring them in.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000 Hold them close.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000 Hold them tight.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000 So you can control them.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.000 So you can recognize their form and their presence and their actions.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:57.000 And I read about those soldiers living in the streets barely living.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Lost on alcohol and drugs.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000 I think at least in my mind.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000 It's not because they surrendered to the demons.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000 It's because they didn't see them.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000 They didn't know that they were there.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000 They didn't recognize them and they got ambushed.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000 And in fighting.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000 You know, in fighting, it's the punch that you don't see that knocks you out.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000 And in war, it's the ambush that you don't see that kills you.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000 And in your mind, it's gotta be the thoughts that you don't see.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000 The things that you don't acknowledge that you try to ignore.
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:47.000 The ones that you try and say aren't there that you don't admit to.
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000 Those are the ones that get you.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Those are the ones that drag you down.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Those are the ones that make you weaker that control you.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:06.000 That pull you into a bottle of pills or a booze or into rage or depression.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:15.000 When you see an alcoholic or a drug addict or someone that has some thing dragging them down.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000 It's often because they failed to truly admit that that demon is there.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000 And that demon has control over them.
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:34.000 And they failed to recognize that they can control the demon.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000 I say,
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000 Know your enemy.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000 Know your demons.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And that way you can control them and fight them and keep them at bay.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000 And you don't need to kill them.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000 In fact, I don't even know if you can't kill them.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000 They're part of you.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000 They're part of what makes you, you, they're part of what makes me me.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000 I don't want to kill them.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:10.000 Because if I killed my demons,
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000 then maybe I kill my angels as well.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000 But you need to put them in their place.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000 You need to control them.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000 Keep those demons in check.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000 So they don't sneak up on you.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000 And nash you.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.000 And end up controlling you.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000 And there's one more piece to this.
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000 The stronger that you get,
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000 the weaker the demons get,
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000 the more you control them,
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000 the easier they are to control.
01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:05.000 It just takes that awareness and that ownership and that recognition and the mindset.
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000 So that you can live your life as you should in control.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000 And on your terms,
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000 not on the terms of the demons in your head.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000 So,
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000 see them.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:37.000 And watch them and control them.
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000 Own them.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000 And then live your life.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:58.000 Now, once again,
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000 it appears that I've gone to that dark place.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000 Yeah, who recommended that book, by the way?
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000 Do you remember?
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000 Yeah, I'll have to figure it out.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000 But I think part of that,
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000 and you and I were talking prior to this,
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000 and I had to tell you,
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000 this is part of me.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000 I've attempted to sit down a couple times with the big positive podcasts,
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000 and I'm sure we will.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000 But I got some demons in there too that are talking,
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000 and this is what they're drawn to,
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000 and I want to face them.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000 I want to face them.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000 I want to look at them.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000 I want to go toe to toe with them.
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000 And another thing is,
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000 as both those soldiers said,
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.000 people shouldn't get to live without knowing what war is like.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000 Because until you know what war is like,
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000 or at least until you open your mind to understand what it is,
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000 where it comes from, what it does to people,
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000 then that's a whole,
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000 it's a whole part of humanity that you're not seeing.
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000 And it's the darkest part.
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000 And you've got to recognize that,
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000 especially because if you don't recognize that that darkness is there,
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000 again, you're not going to see the beauty you have in your own life,
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000 and you know what?
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000 That was dark, that was deep,
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000 and you know what?
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000 In the next 10 minutes,
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000 you're not going to be laughing at something.
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000 We're going to be enjoying something,
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000 we're going to have some fun,
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000 and I think in that respect, the podcast,
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000 it reflects life.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000 Because life has ups and downs,
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000 and it has misery,
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000 and it has sadness,
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000 and it also has fun,
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000 and it has laughter.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000 And that's what reality is.
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000 And all those pieces,
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000 for me,
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000 the struggle,
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000 the struggle and the pain,
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000 that is life.
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000 That is the education,
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 that's the reward,
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000 that experience that you get,
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000 that's what makes you better.
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000 And I think that's why we keep ending up here.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000 But,
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000 we don't dwell there.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000 And I don't dwell there.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000 And I don't think people should dwell there.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000 That's one of the best things about recognizing
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000 when you've got these things in your head.
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000 If you're trying to ignore them,
01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000 they stay there.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000 When you face them,
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000 guess what?
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000 I can move on.
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000 And in 10 minutes,
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000 you're not going to be laughing about something.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000 I don't know what, yet.
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000 Probably at you.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000 There we go.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000 We're already there.
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000 The demon for the night has been faced,
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000 my friend.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000 Looks like it.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:17.000 Yeah.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000 So now let's get to the good stuff,
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000 to the light.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000 The internet stuff.
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000 That's right.
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000 The internet stuff.
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:24.000 That's right.
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000 The interwebs.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000 Speaking of interwebs,
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000 we are, in fact, sponsored by Onit.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000 But onit.com slash jockel.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000 To get your warrior bars.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000 Also known as the anti-donate.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000 Anti-donate.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000 All right.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000 Yeah, the anti-donate.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000 You don't know.
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000 And don't get your warrior bar.
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000 You're self-sombed.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000 Good protein.
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000 Some good fat.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000 Not much carbs.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000 You know what's funny?
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000 Well, you know what's funny?
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000 If you're not,
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000 if you're in the mood,
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000 like, you know,
01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000 you get cravings for some sprinkles or something.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000 I don't know.
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000 Something next.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000 The warrior bar.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000 And it was real deep and dark.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000 And it's, it's tough read.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000 I said it, but I said it briefly.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000 Oh, we're lagging.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000 Be, you know, a little bit lagging.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.000 Okay.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000 That's my fault.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000 So I didn't make it clear enough that, you know.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000 That that was important.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000 Yeah.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000 That's absolutely true.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000 It is kind of your fault.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000 Then a cold and a jockel's head on it says good backwards when you look at it.
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000 So this is good.
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.000 So I was talking to a guy and was basically saying, hey, listen man, you know,
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000 we were going back and forth.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000 We were texting.
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000 And I forget what started it off, but it was something along the lines of, you know, you got to just put your ego and check here.
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.000 And he said something like, you know, we all need to put our eyes on him.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000 No, he said, I got to put my ego and check.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000 You go and check.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000 I said, we all got to put our ego and check.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000 I got to work on that too.
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000 Of course.
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000 We always do.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000 And he said, yeah, and I'm not the one that has a t-shirt with my face on it.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.000 And I said, yeah, you're also not the one that wrote a 300 page book about yourself.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000 And who has a podcast that's named after that's just your name.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000 So believe me, we all got to work on it.
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000 Well, that sure things different because I made the shirt.
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000 That was my job.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000 I did put the shirt like that.
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000 And then the bumpers, the president, but if you haven't seen those.
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000 Yeah, go make echo, man.
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000 Jocco 2016 bumper stickers.
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000 So yeah, I did it for the greater good.
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.000 I guess that's, I guess that's cool.
01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000 I wonder what kind of cars are those going to be on?
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000 Are they going to be on, you know, Volkswagen's?
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000 Are they going to be on Mercedes?
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000 So who's going to put those on?
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000 I'm going to see, I think we see Ford's and Chevy's.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000 Maybe for the most part.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000 Yeah, oh, sure. Yeah.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.000 I don't know.
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000 Get some European vehicles in there too.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000 We'll see you pretty good.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000 Nonetheless, if you want a bumper sticker on your car, whatever kind of car you got,
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000 you can get those at joccostore.com as well.
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000 Yeah, sure. It's bumper stickers all this stuff if you want them.
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000 All right, let's go.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.000 Cool.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000 So, I'll just ask you a question.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000 Jocco, as someone who's been getting after it for as long as for a long time and is
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000 in create injuries along the way, I see that you're a fan of mobility
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000 what.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000 I've been into star at stuff for a while myself.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000 Do you have any perspective on the difference that mobility and form can have on
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000 performance, not just on addressing or preventing injuries?
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000 Did you encounter any material like this on your younger days in your younger days as a seal?
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:32.000 At an age when a lot of younger guys will just slam through things.
01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:40.000 As someone who's still very active in your 40s, I'm curious to hear what your thoughts are versus how
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000 you're 20s selfless.
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000 Well, so the first part of the question about form and technique and mobility affecting
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000 performance, absolutely.
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:54.000 I mean, technique is king, right, in any sport and it's funny when you break into a new sport,
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000 you realize how important technique is because you think I can do that and then you try it and go,
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000 there's a lot of technique.
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000 Jiu Jitsu is a classic example, but any sport that you play that looks like it's not that hard.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000 You go ahead and try it.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000 You realize how much of us every sport is technique.
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000 So, technique is absolutely important.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000 Mobility is also important and being able to move well and move smoothly, you know,
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000 there's that whole, I don't know if it's a trend going on right now,
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000 but this idea of movement training, you know, it's the same thing, you know, how, how are you going to move?
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000 Well, how do you move your body well?
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000 So mobility is absolutely going to make your better performer.
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000 Now, when I was younger,
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000 the, I mean, we just did not do this stuff.
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000 It was just merciless, no stretching, bad diet,
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000 no mobility, and when we were sore or whatever,
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000 we just just were sore.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000 I mean, that was it.
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000 And, and looking back, I wish we knew more of that stuff.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000 We just didn't know it at the time.
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000 Maybe people knew it.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000 I didn't know it.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000 My buddies didn't know it.
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000 We just did what we did.
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000 We just worked out hard and just dealt with the pain.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000 And when we were sore or had an injury,
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000 we just sucked it up and just drove through it.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000 And I'm sure that's not good.
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000 So I think there should definitely be a focus on this kind of stuff.
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000 And it, you know, I think with one of the things that's,
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000 I think, I like me, I need more focus on that,
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000 because I don't do enough mobility work.
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000 I don't do enough stretching.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000 Never mind, let's mobility is like a moderate of an stretching.
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000 Right?
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000 That's actually, you know, Eddie Bravo,
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000 who's in GJ2, if you don't know what that is,
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000 GJ2, Blackbelt, really creative game.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000 But he won't give somebody their Blackbelt unless they can do the lotus sit.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000 Which is crazy.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000 I mean, I can't come close to doing a lotus sit,
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000 which is when you put your feet on top of your thighs.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000 And he's told, I've heard him talk a couple times about,
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000 you know, guys that were completely inflexible, big football players.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000 And then he's like, you know, you can't get your Blackbelt until you can do the lotus.
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000 And these dudes just put their mind to it and can do it.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000 So just like anything else, you need to set some goals.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000 I don't think I'm quite willing to step out onto the,
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000 I'm going to do a lotus.
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000 But who knows, maybe that's something you set in the sand
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 and make it happen.
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000 And I think though, I think things can all people can go too far with that stuff.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000 And I've said this before, like some of that extreme yoga
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000 where you're just tying yourself a knots and going beyond
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000 what a human's supposed to be able to do.
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000 That's not, I don't believe that's good for your
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000 and I have a couple friends.
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000 I've one friend in particular that was a hard core yoga guy who's using the
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000 seal team to go out.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000 Hard core yoga guy.
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000 And he said, he said, he believed it caused a lot of problems
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000 when he got older and his back and his spine and his neck and his joints.
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000 Because you develop laxity, you know, you've developed looseness.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000 You have a higher probability.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000 So I think you should stretch and be capable of the full range of
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000 motion of what a normal, well-oiled human should be able to do.
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000 I think once you start putting your arms, you know, backwards
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000 upside down and behind in between your legs and then back up again,
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000 I think you're going to have issues with that.
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000 I also think I do get some mobility from the workouts that I do
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000 from, I do deep squats, right?
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000 I go all the way down on squats, I do a lot of overhead squats.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000 I do muscle ups, I do full range of motion, pull ups and dips on
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000 getting that movement, doing surfing, jiu-jitsu.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000 I mean, you're constantly, you got to stay, you got to keep moving.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000 You know, that's what I think you got to do.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000 You got to keep moving, you got to move in ways that are varied
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000 and make you move in different directions running, swimming, surfing,
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000 jiu-jitsu, all different kinds of work and I'm just getting after it,
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000 basically.
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000 You know, and that's another thing that I did right down here is a note
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000 is, man, when I was younger, we just didn't tap that often in the jiu-jitsu.
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000 And you know, everybody asks me, everybody that hits me up on Twitter
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000 and says, first day of jiu-jitsu class tomorrow, what's your advice?
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000 My advice is tap early and tap often because your ego,
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000 if you let your ego control the tapping mechanism, you're going to get hurt.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000 And it might not be instant.
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000 Like my neck is jacked up, I've had neck surgery.
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000 That's from Dean Lister.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000 That's from being in a guillotine and not tapping and being in arm
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000 jokes and not tapping, that's from 20 years of not tapping to that stuff.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000 Because I can take a pretty good joke.
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000 So it's cool that you didn't tap and you got out.
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000 But after 20 years, guess what, you got some neck damage, son.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000 And it's not to get it originally and buds that I definitely
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000 definitely buds had something to do with it too.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000 But just wear and tear, but the additional wear and tear from jiu-jitsu,
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000 definitely, you know, I think had a little something to do with it,
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000 which was all unnecessary.
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000 It was just, hey, I'm not going to tap to this joke.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000 It hurts my neck.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000 I hear some noises in there, but I'm not tapping to it.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000 Yeah.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.000 It's not smart.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000 Yes, especially those neck ones, because there is an element of pain tolerance
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000 that can help you in the neck stuff.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000 But you get a arm bar as a new guy and then you're rolling with another guy
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000 who's kind of new, but he might know how to do the arm bar.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000 He might be kind of spazzing going hard and unnecessarily.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000 Because he doesn't know the control yet and if you don't tap really
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000 that's when you're going to get jammed up.
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000 Tap really and tap off in people.
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000 Or if you start tapping right when you feel the pain that's wrong too,
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000 because a lot of times guys will put you in it and it's kind of understood
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000 that boom you're locked in.
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000 You know, you're not going anywhere so they kind of expect to tap.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000 You don't tap.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000 Like I might think, oh, I'm not doing it right.
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000 Or I'm not, he has more flexibility.
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000 He has one fodder shunt.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000 He has one fodder shunt.
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000 I'm not doing it right.
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000 Yeah, right.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000 It's hard or exactly. It's especially best locked in.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000 So it's like, all right.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000 And then boom, you're hurt.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000 Not good.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000 Rod deal.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000 Not good.
01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000 It's hard to select the ability though.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000 Flexibility though.
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000 And Eddie Bravo actually said this in a way where you know,
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000 little kids like little babies two years old.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000 Yeah, we'll put it around their heads no problem.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Yeah, but for the most part, but they're not going to do this weird
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000 yo, you know how like some guys are, they're like double jointed or something.
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000 They won't be able to do that kind of stuff.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000 So put loosely these two year olds.
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000 They have full flexibility.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.000 Right.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000 And you just lose it over time as you gain muscle.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.000 You gain rigidity as you're, you know, everything gets stronger and stuff.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:31.000 And if you don't put your body through those motions, you just kind of lose it.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.000 So let's say if you're in a stretching for that from the being in the genetics,
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000 we'll play a part in that, that, that, how stretchy you can be.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:43.000 But so in a way, you can get back there.
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000 You just kind of work on getting that.
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000 You just just, it's a more, it's just like anything I've got.
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000 Yeah, but yeah, pushing too far seems kind of weird because like, yeah,
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000 let's say I don't know, you can stretch your shoulder way behind your back.
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000 Way behind your back.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000 You don't have any really real strength there.
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000 No.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000 But meanwhile, it's still easy to be back there.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000 You know, and, I don't know, it seems like your joints kind of get rigid for it to be stronger, right?
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000 I agree.
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000 So bone before?
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000 Yeah.
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000 I agree.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000 Next question.
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:26.000 How do the seals deal with fatigue, soreness, and beat down, and the beat down of buds, and SQT, without getting injured?
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000 Well, you just get used to it.
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:34.000 And again, you know, I say this all the time buds and the SQT, which is the kind of the initial training after you get done with buds,
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000 which is the basic underwater demolition.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000 I mean, that's a short part of your career. I mean, it's literally a fraction of your career. It means nothing.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000 But just like any working out, you get used to it.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:21:01.000 And if it's like when you work out, when you, if you haven't worked out for a long time, or someone that someone that just starts working out from nowhere, never worked out before, they're going to be sore as hell when they first work out.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:10.000 I just had this happen to me, because I got, I went on the road, I went on a road trip, multiple back to back road trips, and I went overseas, came back when I came back. I got sick.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000 So I was for like three weeks. I hadn't squatted heavy.
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:21.000 At all. I had no body. All I did was body weight squats, you know, pistols just lunges.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000 That's how I worked my legs. There's just no way to do what you can do.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000 You know, hotel room in some strange part of Europe.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000 And when I came back, I was all happy, and I got on that squat. Once I, then I was sick.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000 Then once I got done being sick, I finally felt good. I got back on that squat rack.
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000 And man, my legs were destroyed.
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:49.000 For four or five days, I'm talking, you know, having a hard time sitting down, having a hard time standing up. It was gnarly.
01:21:49.000 --> 01:22:05.000 But that's just because my body just, it just wasn't lost that element. So of course, if you just started working out in your walking around sore all the time, that's, that's because you got to get used to it.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000 And in Buds, you do get injured just because it's massively repetition.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:16.000 You know, there was a guy that we had that was a trainer, an athletic trainer for professional sports team.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:25.000 And when he was there, there's this great example. There's something called Patela for moral syndrome, which is when you're patela because of the way you're running.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000 It rubs on your your femur and it becomes problematic.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:40.000 And he said in like a whole season in the NFL, or he would see maybe one of those injuries.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:48.000 Maybe two, and you know, he'd have to figure out what it is. And when he was working in Buds, he would literally see 30 of those a week.
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.000 So you just get to see, I mean, there's more people. There's 10 times the people, but it still is massive amount of injuries.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000 And it's the same thing in the seal teams and the seal teams.
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:03.000 It's your shoulders, it's your backs, it's your knees, it's your ankles. You get abused.
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:08.000 And it's, it's, it's not the working out that doesn't to you.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:14.000 It's not working out. It's carrying a guy on your shoulder over the rocky terrain out in the desert and tripping on ankle.
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.000 That's what you get hurt. It's jumping over off of a wall and you land on a cinder block that breaks and you, you know, it's that's the kind of stuff.
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000 The working out doesn't really do it to you.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:33.000 I actually, one of the things when when I was a tasking to commander, we were going through land warfare training.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000 And I would work out every day and I would roll with guys, like teach them some suggestions and then roll with them.
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000 And I would, you know, guys are, because you know, we're working hard during the day or during the night.
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.000 And I was kind of making fun of some guys that were taking motrin and I was like, you don't need that.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000 You're weak and stuff like that.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000 And sure enough, right after we got done, I got something called Burstitis and my elbow because in land warfare,
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:06.000 you're constantly getting down to the desert crawling and then I was in Gitu on the mat and I just banged a couple times and sure enough, my elbow swelled up.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000 And I had to take motrin.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000 Yeah, don't, don't open your mouth, Jocco.
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000 Just keep it to yourself.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000 So, you know, again, I was hammering guys, but in a joking manner and so they hammered me right back when I had the,
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000 the motrin pills to try and heal that up.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.000 But it is like I said, it's that it's the, the injuries come from not from working out.
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000 In fact, I always think that the working out prevents the injuries, you know, that I think that's true with everything.
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000 I think that's true with Gitu.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000 I think that's true with life.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000 You, you work out your strong, your joints are strong, you, your muscle densities better.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000 You're, I mean, just just work out because it'll prevent injuries more than it.
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000 More than I don't worry about, I look at working out, not as injury is going to happen.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000 I look at working out as injury prevention.
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:06.000 And the last thing is, you shouldn't need to like completely crush yourself every day in your workouts.
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000 I mean, you shouldn't be going to a point that you have massive muscle soreness over your whole body or over even body parts.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000 You don't need to do that. You don't need to do that.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000 You know, do you want to push yourself?
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.000 Yeah, you want to push yourself, but you want to be so sore that you can't perform your job.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000 And also, I like, you know, active rest.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000 You know, I hardly ever just do nothing.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000 Occasionally, I will. Occasionally, I'll just man, I'm broke down.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000 Yeah.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000 And just eat steak and just chill.
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000 But, but I like to do the active rest.
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000 You know, I like to do some kind of jog, swim, surf, whatever.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000 And, you know, actually, Gitu, like, if I have a sore back, I love getting on the mat.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.000 Yeah, just loosens everything up, feels so good.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000 But, that's only at a certain level.
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000 Yeah.
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000 Because when you're a white belt or a blue belt or a purple belt,
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000 Ben, that's just a battle.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000 You're getting off the mat sore.
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000 I don't get off the mat sore from Gitu seldom.
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000 So do I get off the mat like man, I'm tired.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000 I mean, we trained today.
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000 I'm not, that was a no factor.
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000 You know what I mean?
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000 You just, oh, yeah, we trained.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000 Yeah.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000 If you get into the take down that element, though, that,
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000 Yeah, but even if you want to, yeah,
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000 I'll be hard on your back, but even to take down elements, you know,
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000 if you're just going to do pure take downs, yeah, but I mean,
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000 I don't think that's going to last how long, if you're back sore,
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000 full guard and work as something else.
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000 Yeah.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000 So that's it.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000 And the bottom line is you work out, you do some of these workouts.
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000 You'll get used to it, you'll get in those own,
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000 and then you won't be so sore all the time.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000 Yeah, that, as an advocate of rest, I,
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000 that's important that part, where you're like, don't beat your
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000 down yourself down.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000 Because the exercise that technically,
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.000 freely split hairs here,
01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.000 the exercise doesn't make you stronger.
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000 The recovery from the exercise is when you get stronger.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:57.000 So yeah, the exercise is a part of the whole system that makes you
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000 strong, but when you recover from that exercise,
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000 that's when you're stronger.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000 I'll give you that.
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000 So yeah.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000 But the workout itself is what induces the recovery.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000 So sure.
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000 Yeah, so there you go.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000 Well, I guess so it's all kinds of different classes, right?
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000 Different approaches, like you, you prefer the active rest.
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000 And that going hard every day,
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000 some people, they prefer go hard every day,
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000 but then they'll have a straight up to three days off.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000 That's completely, you know?
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000 But yeah, the recovery from the exercise, that's the ticket.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000 Yeah, and when I say go hard, I mean, like the muscular,
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000 you know, destroy, like if you can do squats until you can't walk,
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000 you can't do that all the time.
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000 Yeah, if you don't need to, right?
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000 You need to initiate the growth.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000 You don't need to destroy them.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000 Yeah.
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000 And you can do, you know, you can put with a metabolic conditioning,
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000 you can really can destroy yourself a lot more often.
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000 And if you're doing it right, you shouldn't really be getting musculially sore
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000 from your metabolic condition.
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000 Yeah.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000 If you're doing it right.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000 But then again, isn't that really a spectrum as well?
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:05.000 It is a spectrum.
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000 It can be like a heavier.
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000 Yeah, it can.
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000 That's the beauty of workout.
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:16.000 That's why you should never get bored with workout, because you can change it up.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000 Next question.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000 Jockel, did you ever use GJ to incomet?
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000 Wouldn't a striking art be better for combat situations?
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000 Okay, so yes, and definitely.
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000 This is one of the things where I was actually,
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000 I read things about this and people say, well, no,
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000 I mean, why would a seal ever have to use hand-to-hand combat?
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000 They have a rifle, they have a pistol, they've got buddies with them.
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000 So if you have to use your hand-to-hand combat, you've done something wrong.
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000 And that's actually completely wrong.
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000 Because, you know, it's very simple.
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000 You go into a room where there's people in there,
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000 and none of them are armed, and you have to get control of them.
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000 You can't just start shooting people.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000 You're going to have to get control of them.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000 So how do you get control of them?
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000 Well, again, how does striking give you control of someone?
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000 The answer is it does not.
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000 Unless you have a miracle touch that you can just knock people out with one touch,
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000 and then you can handcuff them.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000 People don't boxers.
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000 Don't knock each other out consistently.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000 You know, it's very difficult to knock someone out.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000 And so this idea that striking is better.
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000 You absolutely have to know how to strike.
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:41.000 But striking is a very inconsistent way to get control of somebody.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000 Very, very inconsistent way of controlling people.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.000 And actually, the sad thing is that it's striking is the most traumatic
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.000 to the person that you're applying it to.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000 And, you know, we used to do something, or we were taught something called a musl strike.
01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000 Right?
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000 Like, we hit the person with the musl of your gun.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000 And the people that were teaching it would be like thinking that that just stopped people.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000 Like, oh, you give them one good musl strike.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000 Because it does.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000 It seems like, you know, a musl is a very strong, I mean, a very small point of impact.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000 And you think, oh, if I put all my force behind this small point of impact, man,
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000 that's really going to, you know, hurt somebody and take them down.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000 And I saw hundreds of musl strikes.
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.000 And they're really brutal. And what they do is they cut you.
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000 They cut you open very badly.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000 I saw a lot of really bad cuts.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000 With rifle.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000 With rifle.
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000 And, but they sell them.
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000 Did they actually knock the person out.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.000 So what do you do then?
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000 You musl strike them again.
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000 And then what do you do after that?
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000 You musl strike them again.
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000 And what do you do?
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000 So you end up just beating them.
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000 Beat in them.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000 But it's a harsh beating because you're using a, you know,
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000 a pretty sharp musl of a weapon, which is cutting them open.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000 So it's, it's, it's not the best.
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.000 Whereas if someone can get control of somebody in a grappling type scenario,
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000 get control, you know, clench with them, take them down quickly.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:11.000 You can get control very quickly and they feel it.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.000 And they resist less because they kind of feel owned.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000 And they also don't feel like you're hurting them.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000 Whereas when you're striking them in a face, man.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000 What's your natural answer?
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000 Reaction if I strike you in the face.
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.000 You can put your hands up.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000 Well, if you put your hands up, maybe you're trying to attack me.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 Now I got to hit you even harder.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000 So it's a, it's kind of a bad deal.
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.000 So yeah, and then once you get personal underground,
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000 obviously the more you know the better you're going to do.
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000 And that's why, you know, it's good.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000 It's good to have that well roundedness,
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000 but you definitely want to use, you know,
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000 you definitely want to have a good ground game.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000 You want to have good striking, too, of course.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000 And, but the Gigiitsu and the ground,
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000 the ground game is very important because you've got to control people.
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000 And in a combat situation, everybody you come up against is not a combatant.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000 And they still need to get controlled.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000 And some people, you can just motion to them to get down.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000 And that's great.
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000 And then you can tell them to lay down.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000 And that's great.
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000 And you can have your interpreter,
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000 telling them to put their hands behind their back.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000 And then that's great.
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000 Or you can say that, you know, you can learn a few phrases,
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.000 which we always did.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000 We always knew a few phrases to tell them to, you know,
01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000 get down, show me your hands or whatever.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000 But then you get the person that maybe they don't respond.
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000 To what you're saying.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000 And why aren't they responding?
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000 And this is something I see in some of these police videos.
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:32.000 When I yell at you, you know, get down, get down.
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000 Well, you might be scared.
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000 You might not know what I'm talking about.
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000 You might have headphones on.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000 You might be deaf.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000 You might just be frozen with fear.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000 Yeah.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000 You might be a bad guy.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000 You might be getting ready to run.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000 All those different things.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000 But if you're not doing what I tell you to do,
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000 I gotta get you to the ground.
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000 So how am I gonna do that?
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.000 And again, I can walk up and take a swing at you.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.000 But, you know, I've been punching the face many, many times.
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000 And been knocked out.
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000 But twice.
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000 So all the times I've been punching the face.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000 You know, many, many times.
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000 I don't know how many, but many, many times.
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000 It's hard to knock someone out.
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:14.000 So if you think, because you walk over and strike someone,
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000 you're gonna knock him out.
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000 Then you're gonna have control.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000 It's just a fallacy.
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000 So you're gonna have to know some.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000 And the thing, this all goes back to this, you know,
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000 this case, and I forget what the case was.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000 But somebody got choked years ago, like in the 70s.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000 By a police officer.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000 And I think they died or whatever.
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000 But they banned choking.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000 They banned choking from most police forces.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000 So that's why these guys, what do they do?
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000 They pull out their batons.
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000 It's our beating people.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000 That was a big, big thing with Rodney King.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:44.000 You know, why didn't someone just go and put this guy to sleep?
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000 And he'd have no marks on his body.
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000 You know, he'd be okay.
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000 You could bring him back to the jail cell.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000 He's not gonna have conclusions.
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000 He's not gonna have the crap you down.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000 We have no permanent damage whatsoever.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000 But it wasn't allowed.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000 Because of the, because of the political situation that had happened
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000 years before you weren't allowed to teach someone how to choke someone
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:08.000 and put them to sleep and completely incapacitate them.
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000 I mean, the chokehold is a beautiful,
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000 and a beautiful thing. And when you have, when you have, I mean, you saw the Rodney King tape.
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000 I mean, there's, I don't know how many cops are worried,
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000 but there's multiple cops beating him.
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000 That's a classic example of what I'm saying.
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000 Just because you strike someone doesn't even with a Billy Club.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000 Doesn't mean they're gonna stop.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000 Yeah.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000 Whereas when you put a chokehold on somebody,
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000 they are going to sleep.
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000 Yeah.
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000 They are going to sleep 100%.
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000 Yeah.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000 And when you have three cops going against one guy,
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000 someone is going to get a chokehold on.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000 Yeah.
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000 And despite what they did to Rodney King beating him,
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000 he wasn't stopping.
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000 And so, yeah, it's one of those things.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000 I really hope that the, the law enforcement gets the ability to use,
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000 to train better to use chokeholds,
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000 to use other forms of grappling,
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000 because it is absolutely superior from a law enforcement perspective
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:04.000 and from, and from, even from, like I said,
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000 from a military perspective
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000 when you go into a room and there's non-combatants in there
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000 that you have to control over.
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000 You don't want to start beating people.
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000 Yeah.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000 You want to use the minimum required force.
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.000 Yeah.
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000 And yeah, when people aren't compliant,
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000 you have to be able to do something.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000 Yeah.
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000 So, yeah, the minimum required force that,
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000 essentially makes striking,
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000 obsolete if you're trying to approach it that way.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000 Or if that's the regulation, you know?
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000 Yeah.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.000 The regulation.
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000 If you're, if you're a human,
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000 yeah.
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000 and you've got a woman that is scared,
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000 or doesn't speak your language, or is petrified,
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000 or whatever the case may be,
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000 your answer is to strike or in the face.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000 Right.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000 And what is it?
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000 By the way, what is her husband do when you strike her in the face?
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000 As opposed to if you come over, you put your hands on her.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000 You gently push her to ground, you feel some resistance.
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000 Maybe you have to do some sort of manipulation of a joint
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000 to get to control,
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.000 but that is so much more mild than a musl strike to the
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000 face.
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.000 Yeah.
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000 And if you know what to do, if you know
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000 you get to, it's a no brain.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:10.000 Yeah.
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000 And it's not hard to do to people.
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000 And even, and you'll see sometimes when someone's trying to get,
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000 you know, gain control and I'll put their arm behind their back,
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000 like chicken wings situation, they'll do it.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.000 Oh, hard.
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000 Like real hard.
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000 Because they kind of got to add that element of pain,
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000 so the guy will kind of quote him quote no.
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000 Most of you, you do it stuff.
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.000 You don't have to put that pain.
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000 It's just that controlling, like you just can't.
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000 That's why a lot of people were talking about this today.
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000 How a lot of people after they get their first time in juditsu or something
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000 or early on in juditsu a guy will tap him out.
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000 And they'll have this thing in their mind.
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000 Oh, I just have to go harder.
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000 You know, I can just, I can gain some kind of control.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000 I just got to go harder, but it's not a hard thing.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000 It's not like aggressive feeling to get controlled like that.
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000 You just simply control.
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000 And you know, this ties so much to life.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000 Yeah.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000 Because we talk about, I mean, you hear me talk about this all the time.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000 And I was going back and forth with somebody on Twitter the other day about,
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000 I'm like, you got to use the indirect approach with people.
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000 Right.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000 So picture this.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000 Next time you're dealing with a person that's combative.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000 And I mean, now I'm talking about verbally combative or their,
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.000 their ideas are combative against your combatives.
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:25.000 Is the first thing you want to do go up and punch him in the face or
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.000 or musl's strike them?
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000 Right.
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:28.000 Because what is their reaction going to be?
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000 What their reaction is going to be immediately defensive.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000 You don't want to put people in that predicament.
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000 You want to use the jutsu on them.
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000 You want to, you want to get them feeling comfortable.
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000 When you're going to sleep, you, when somebody puts a chokehold on you,
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000 you're done.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000 I mean, you're just going to sleep.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000 You sneak in behind.
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000 So, so don't get this idea that when you're dealing with people in a
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000 confrontation, not only physically, but a verbal or a mental
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.000 confrontation.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000 And I'm not even talking about a confrontation in.
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000 You know, yelling in the street.
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000 I'm talking about in the office.
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:04.000 I'm talking about dealing with one of your subordinates.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000 I'm talking about dealing with your boss or whoever think about
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000 using instead of thinking about, hey, I'm going to, you know,
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000 smash this person in the face and that's going to bring me the win.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000 No, it's not.
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000 Generally, it is not.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000 Generally, what brings you the win is, okay, hey, what's going on?
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000 Let's sneak in there.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000 Let's get inside their head.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000 Let's, let's, let's not aggravate the situation.
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000 Yeah.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000 Let's bring the situation towards a better area where we can use our control.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000 Yeah, you won't get the win.
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000 You'll get a fight.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000 Oh, yeah, you definitely get a fight.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.000 Even though that's not the goal.
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:46.000 Yeah, you'd be, if they are combative and your answer is to be more combative.
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000 You know, and of course they're answering.
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000 Yeah, you know, their answer is, yeah, even more combative.
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000 So, yeah, then you got yourself a fight.
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000 And then you know, Hannah and then Gracie, they're doing good stuff with law enforcement.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000 Using Jiu Jitsu and actual police tactics, so it comes from, you know, it's in context.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000 And you know what, if you're a police officer out there or you're in law enforcement,
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000 then you know, Hannah, that's great.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 Guess what?
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000 There's a Jiu Jitsu studio everywhere in the country right now.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000 Go train some Jiu Jitsu.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000 Yeah.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000 Just go start training.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000 No big deal.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000 Just go start training.
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000 Yeah.
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000 I have a friend Craig, he's from from Hawaii.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000 He, um, good cop.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000 He's human, Facebook, I all like reposes stuff sometimes.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.000 He'll like, he'll come down to the skate park where they're, you know, he got called or whatever.
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000 Whatever.
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000 You posted it and he'll be writing.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000 Yeah.
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000 He'll do some skating or he'll race somewhere or whatever.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000 But he's a Jiu Jitsu guy.
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000 I think he's a pro-war brown belt.
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000 Yeah.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000 So he has the confidence.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000 Yeah.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000 Man.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000 That's what it is.
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000 He has the confidence.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000 Yeah.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000 He can be a good guy, you know, good guy with the power.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000 Next question.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000 Jiu Jitsu.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:02.000 How do you prepare for Buds specifically and where were you physically,
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000 wise within your class?
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000 It must be a physical night around here.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000 Physical activity night.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000 That's what the questions are tonight.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000 It seems like.
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000 So how did I prepare for Buds?
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000 Well, again, you got to go back.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.000 This is now 1989, 1990.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000 And out of that prepare for Buds back then, well, we didn't know anything.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000 I didn't know anything.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000 There was no media.
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000 There was no internet.
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000 There was nothing.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000 There wasn't even need books.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000 So what did I do?
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000 And it wasn't even a Wii.
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000 It was just an I because I was alone.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000 I didn't know any seals.
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000 I didn't know any of those in any kind of special operations at all.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000 So you're just young and stupid and just okay.
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000 So I just looked at it and said,
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:57.000 it appears that seal training is a bunch of running and swimming and pushing pushups and pull ups and
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.000 rope climbs and dips.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:05.000 Looks to me like in the pictures that the recruiter showed me.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000 They were wearing boots and fatigues.
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000 So what did I do?
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:17.000 Went to the Army Navy store bought a couple pair of fatigue pants, bought a couple pairs of
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:23.000 jungle boots that looked like what I saw in the recruiting office.
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000 And I just ran with boots on.
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000 I swam.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000 I did full of pushups and dips.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000 That's what I did to get ready for.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000 There was no periodization.
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000 And there wasn't any plan.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000 There was no, I wasn't doing the wad.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000 You know, there was no workout of the day.
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:43.000 I just ran and swam and did full of pushups and dips and I did them a lot.
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:51.000 And actually, I did them a lot, but I didn't even know what I was capable of or what
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000 even a person was capable of.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000 Because back then you could look up on the internet and say like what's good as far as
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.000 pull ups go.
01:41:58.000 --> 01:41:59.000 Yeah.
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:00.000 I had no idea.
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000 You know, so I think I could do 18.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000 That's all it.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000 No, it's not.
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000 Not when you're going to a seal training.
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000 But you know, you just had no idea.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000 I just said, okay, that's and I didn't know how to do get to be able to do more.
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000 I mean, I just did a bunch.
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000 Yeah.
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:17.000 Does that work though?
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000 I mean, didn't that work?
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000 Yeah.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:19.000 Yeah.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000 It did.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000 Yeah.
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000 I mean, you do a bunch of pull ups and you get better pull ups.
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000 You do a bunch of dips.
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000 You get better dips.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000 You do a bunch of pushups.
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:27.000 You get better pushups.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000 And luckily I ran with boots on.
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000 That's one thing that got a lot of guys had trouble with.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000 I think nowadays they use these, they're almost like tennis shoes.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000 The boots that they run with are like really light.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000 I love it in Buds.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000 They're really light athletic kind of boots.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000 But back in the day, they were straight just hardcore jungle boots.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000 And a lot of guys had problems, shin splints, stress fractures and all that.
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000 And I was good to go because I was used to running in boots because I was a knucklehead.
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000 And then the other part of the question physically were was, I'm my class.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000 I was about in the middle of the pack.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.000 That's where I was.
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000 I was not the fastest.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000 I was not the fastest runner.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000 Not the fastest swimmer.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000 I wasn't the fastest at the obstacle course.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:15.000 I actually failed to run when I decided in my ultimate brilliance that I would just pace myself for this run.
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000 And failed to run missed the time.
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000 Because the the the run was supposed to be four miles.
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000 But back in those days, there was no supervision on the instructors.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000 Like limited supervision, I should say.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:36.000 And so that the runs would be four point three miles, four point six miles, four point two miles, three point eight miles.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000 You just didn't really know.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000 And it was fine.
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000 I mean, that's the way it should be.
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000 And and actually weren't allowed to wear a watch.
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000 So you had no idea what you're doing.
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000 So I just said, oh, I'm going to pace myself and keep a good steady pace.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000 And I failed.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.000 And so from then on, there's only one way I ran.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000 I mean, that was as hard as I could.
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000 It's literally as hard as I when they blew the whistle to go.
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000 I just ran as hard as I could until the thing was over.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000 Wait, so why did you fail though, like, did you just pace yourself too slowly?
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:04.000 Or did you pace yourself and then you started gasing anyway?
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000 No, I paced myself and it wasn't fast enough.
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000 That's it.
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000 I faced myself and it wasn't fast enough.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000 I just.
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000 And I was there.
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000 I was right behind the cutoff point, you know,
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000 they're like boom and the guy ahead of me gets through and he, you know, one guy ahead of me gets turned away.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000 Like, maybe they're gonna say man.
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000 So I never paced myself again. All I could do to sprint.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000 That's, that's the way a lot of the evolutions were from me.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000 I had to just go as hard as I could because I wasn't the best at any of it.
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:40.000 And the only thing I was maybe a little bit better out was anything I've talked about this before.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000 Anything that I wanted to carry weight like a rock sack.
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000 I was a little bit better out than normal.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000 Not definitely not stellar, but, um, but, you know, I had, uh,
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:55.000 I had an NCA of NC double a water polo champion in my bud's class.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.000 And I had a Olympic alternate gymnast in my bud's class.
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000 And both of those guys were stut at athletes.
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000 I mean, they're both, I mean, those are some of the top athletes in the world.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000 I mean, if you win the uns NC double a championships of water polo
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.000 and you're an Olympic alternate gymnast, you know, you're just a, of specimen.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000 And both of those guys quit.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000 Dang.
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000 Yeah.
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000 And there I was Joe average.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000 Yeah.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000 But, uh, yeah.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000 The bottom line is though.
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000 You get to the, you get to the steel teams, no one cares about buds,
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000 no one cares about that stuff.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000 It's a baseline of training and that's it.
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000 That's why I don't talk about it that often.
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000 It's like, who cares?
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000 He and Bud did, was there like people who, um, like, let's say I was really good at running miles.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000 You know, was there people who would be, you could tell they were showing off to be like first, you know?
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000 No, everyone's trying to win.
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:52.000 I'm just trying to go first.
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.000 And if you, if you ran track more cross country, you were going to be fine in buds for running.
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000 Hmm.
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000 Unless you got stress fractures.
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000 Yeah.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:07.000 If you swam or you played water polo or whatever, you were going to be fine in the running.
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000 So if you did some kind of high school sport that was related to those two, you were going to be pretty good to go.
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.000 Yeah.
01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000 Like, oh, so when you say they're trying to win, they're trying to be first.
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000 Yeah, of course.
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000 Everyone trying to win.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000 Yeah, this is, I mean, right?
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.000 Aren't you?
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:22.000 I am.
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000 It seems like, I guess.
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.000 I guess.
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000 I guess.
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000 Yeah.
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000 I guess.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:29.000 Yeah.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000 You're in that situation, right?
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000 Do your best.
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000 We in.
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000 Be the guy.
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000 The man.
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000 Next question.
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000 Let's do it.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000 One of the most powerful tools I've used as a military leader is rehearsals.
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.000 I would love to hear your thoughts on rehearsals.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000 So rehearsals.
01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000 And this is actually shocking that I've never talked about rehearsals.
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000 Rehearsals like what?
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000 Like, oh, we're going to do it.
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000 Like a dress rehearsal for you.
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000 Yeah.
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000 And they're totally critical.
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000 And one of the biggest parts of preparing for an operation correctly.
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000 You know, we used to have this.
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:11.000 They used to say one third planning, one third gear prep and one third rehearsals.
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000 That's how you're supposed to spend your time.
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000 And it's a it's a rule that gets violated very often because people spend too much time planning
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:22.000 and not enough time rehearsing.
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000 So we would always.
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000 I would always try and push the rehearsals as much as possible.
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000 And I would when I was a when I was in charge of troops.
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000 I would try and push rehearsals.
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000 And then when I was training troops, I would try and get them to rehearse.
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000 But it's hard.
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000 Like I said, people get drawn into the planning piece.
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000 But a plan without rehearsal is not a plan really.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000 So, you know, definitely use the rehearsals rehearses much as you can.
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000 Be hard on yourself during rehearsals rehearsals.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000 We're hers contingencies.
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000 That's something we used to do that I was pretty intent on.
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000 Was rehearsing the contingencies.
01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000 So what could go wrong here?
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000 What could go different at the target area?
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000 What's a different alternate route that we might have to hit the target from?
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000 And just just go through a couple of those contingencies.
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000 And actually when you do that, make sure you if you rehearse a couple of contingencies.
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.000 If you rehearse your main plan, let's say you walk through it three times.
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000 Then you rehearse two or three contingencies.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.000 Go back and do the main plan two more times.
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000 Just so that's what they leave with.
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000 You want that in their heads.
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000 You want that in their heads because otherwise they'll be a little bit of confusion.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000 But you definitely want to rehearse some contingencies as well.
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000 And we also would rehearse the things that were.
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000 The things that happened all the time.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:47.000 So even you know, a good example was was like our breach team, which is the team that kind of goes in to blow up a door.
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000 So you can get in the building and they have their little procedures.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000 We'd rehearse that breach team would rehearse over and over and over again.
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000 So that they're really just smooth and good and then don't have to talk and they can do things very quickly.
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000 And you know, the way we got into vehicles and out of vehicles, we always rehearse that.
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:09.000 Even though we'd rehearse it by me by the end of deployment, you've rehearsed that hundreds of times.
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000 And you still go, hey, dismount the vehicles and get information.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000 Because it's just another time more muscle memory for everybody.
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000 And you could do it with all the stuff that you do in the field.
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000 You know, whether you're calling it a helicopter for a casualty of evacuation.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000 How you're going to set up that landing zone, you rehearse that a few times.
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000 Just do it, you know, a couple times before you roll out an operation.
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000 That way when it happens, everybody knows what to do.
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:40.000 And this obviously translates directly to everything else.
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000 I mean, especially in business.
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:48.000 I mean, we work with construction companies and, you know, I talk a lot of times talk about safety with construction companies.
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000 Because they lose lives.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000 They lose money.
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000 They lose jobs because they have, if they have safety incidences.
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000 And how do they handle when they happen? What do you do?
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000 So, you know, rehearse in the emergency procedures.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000 If when something happens, rehearsing the setup before you start a certain type of, you know, construction operation.
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000 That's good.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000 Even with the sales world.
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000 Like when I, when I, you know, a lot of teams that.
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000 Every business has, well, just about every business has some sort of sales force in it, right?
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000 With that, or trying to sell things.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000 And how do you rehearse for them? Well, you do some role playing.
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000 Where, you know, somebody gets on and plays the super hard client.
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000 You know, somebody gets on and complains.
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000 How do you, Laila, let's rehearse.
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000 Let's, how are you going to talk through when somebody calls up to complain?
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000 And in two or three iterations, people will improve on how they handle complaints and how they handle a super hard client.
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000 How they overcome some objections.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000 But you do that through rehearsal.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000 And it makes you just make you better.
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.000 You know, it's, you know, that the, I mean, another rehearsal would be like a, we work with a gas oil industry.
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000 So how are they going to handle when there is a leak?
01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000 How are they going to handle when there's some kind of a ecological problem or a fire?
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000 What are you going to do?
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000 You know, oh, you're going to dial this number.
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000 Okay, let's check that that number makes works.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000 How long has that number been in this little pamphlet that's been sitting by the phone?
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000 You know, when's the last time that got checked out?
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000 Where's, where is the communications notes?
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000 What if they get hit? What's the alternative plan?
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:24.000 So just, yeah, rehearsals are awesome. The finance world we see it as well.
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.000 What kind, what if there's a drastic downturn in the market or a drastic upturn?
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000 Do you have a rehearsed plan of what you're going to do?
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000 Who you're going to contact if you have decisions to make?
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000 Triggers have been hit.
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000 Just rehearse that stuff.
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000 Yeah.
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000 Just rehearse it.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000 So everybody knows.
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000 And it's very, very helpful.
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000 I know when I was in charge of training, I had a very,
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000 very square away and fired up a corpsman who is our medical support.
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000 And he just, you know, I talked about rehearsals one time or whatever.
01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000 And he came to me and said, hey, we're going to rehearse all of our casualty evacuations for all of our different training sites.
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:06.000 So, and he did it and he'd come back and he'd find, you know, hey, guess what?
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000 This is what I found on this one.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000 The life flight that we were supposed to call didn't exist anymore.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000 They went out of business or they changed their number or whatever.
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:17.000 Or this LZ that we were planning on using has a house on it now.
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000 You know, and so he found real stuff.
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000 And you know what?
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000 This particular guy, a great guy.
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000 He, in that time he got all those casualty evacuations plans squared away.
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:35.000 And in that year, we actually did two real casualty evacuations from training sites for real critical injuries.
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000 And both of them went super smooth all because of his efforts.
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000 And they ran full rehearsals, full rehearsals.
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000 And so just, just that kind of thing.
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.000 And then those things saved lives are for sure.
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000 Just doing those full rehearsals.
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000 So yes, rehearse, rehearse, and rehearse in anything that you're doing.
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000 Because it'll make you better.
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:04.000 Yes, but I should, or you, I would think that any time you're in a situation where being on the spot is a big factor.
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000 You know, where you have to make a decision quick.
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.000 You know, you don't have a day or two days to, you know, analyze and make a decision.
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000 I feel like that would rehearse would be a critical part of preparing for something like that.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:27.000 Yeah, and you can do that with the decision making sure you can set up all kinds of rehearsals for decision making in whatever industry you're in.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000 Just, but what I like to do is make those decisions critical.
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000 Make those challenging so that you're putting somebody on the spot.
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000 You're putting a leader in the spot.
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000 And I'll tell you what, one thing that's very cool about this.
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000 And this is something you can carry over to everything you do.
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000 It goes to decentralized command. It goes to instilling initiative in people.
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:54.000 You run rehearsals where the only solution is to go outside the box of the plan during the rehearsals.
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000 During the rehearsals.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000 Yeah, and then rehearsal where the only solution is to disobey what the order is.
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000 Oh, thank you.
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.000 Yeah.
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000 And the reason I'm bringing this up specifically is because you're talking about rehearsing when there's decisions that need to be made.
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000 So this is going a little bit from rehearsal, almost into a training scenario.
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000 Right.
01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:21.000 So we're getting away from rehearsal where you're rehearsing a specific operation into a training scenario where what you're trying to do in training is you're trying to get people to think.
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000 You're trying to get people to think on their own.
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:28.000 And that is the most beautiful thing that you want as a leader is you want all your people thinking.
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:34.000 And you want them to be able to think with a completely open mind of mind that's been completely freed from constraints.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000 And the way that you do that, one of the ways that you do that, one of the methodologies you can use to do that is everybody's got their box, right?
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000 That they're stuck in.
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:51.000 So you formulate a problem that the only way that they're going to solve the problem is to get outside of that box.
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000 And you know, one of the, one of the best ones is you put somebody in a situation where you put parameters on them.
01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000 And you say, hey, no matter what, you're not allowed to go across this line.
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.000 And then you put them in a situation where they have to cross that line.
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000 And the only way they're going to win us across that line.
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000 And then they come back and they say, well, you didn't tell me not to cross that line.
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000 You know what?
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000 I didn't tell you to get you all your guys killed.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.000 Or I didn't tell you to not make that investment even in this critical situation.
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000 Or I didn't tell you not to do that if we had an ecological disaster that was going on, right?
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000 So you need to train people to use common sense.
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:36.000 That's what you want to train them to do. And it's very hard. You'd be surprised at how, at how constrained people's brains get.
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000 Mine, yours, everybody, we get stuck.
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:47.000 And so it's great to do drilling and training where you are actually opening up the mind and freeing the mind from any kind of constraint.
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000 Where you can see things from varied perspectives that are different from your own.
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000 And you can see outlets and solutions that you would never have seen if you trap yourself inside your box.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:03.000 And those are the kind of training scenarios that are outstanding.
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.000 And those are the kind of training scenarios that make people better leaders and better decision makers.
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000 Because the key thing that they learn how to do is they learn how to detach even at that moment.
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000 We talk about it all the time.
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:28.000 But if you can't detach from that situation, you can't detach far enough away from the picture to see that the only way you're going to solve this problem is by going across that line that you were told not to go across.
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000 If you can't make that detachment, you're never going to cross that line.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000 You're never going to open your mind. You're never going to see that solution.
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:41.000 And that is a horrible trap to be stuck in.
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000 And then we would be boiler room where they during the training they give them, you know, it's a sales thing.
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000 They even indexed all these index cards with rebuttals.
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000 Like, oh my wife won't let me buy this.
01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000 You know, oh your wife runs your family.
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000 Give it to you.
01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000 I have seen it.
01:56:58.000 --> 01:56:59.000 I have seen it.
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:02.000 Yeah, there's some good good training in there and how to overcome those objections.
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000 And people become better at it.
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000 And the more you give them to chew on the better they'll get out.
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000 It's the same thing where you're trying to give people the tools.
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000 But you know, I want to go into that scenario and I want to ask them a question when I'm training them that they've never,
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.000 I want to give them a rejection that they've never heard before.
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.000 What them think on their feet?
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000 Let them see, let them step back and say, hey, you know what this one's on the cards?
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000 Where am I going to go with it?
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.000 Right. Yeah, the card seems like that would fall within rehearsal.
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.000 Right. Right. Right.
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000 It's expanded rehearsal.
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:37.000 Yeah, I bet you they get 95% of the, of the common amount of time.
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000 The common objections that you get, you know, you talk to a car salesman.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000 They hear X amount of objections.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.000 You talk to a phone salesman or an internet salesman or a, you know,
01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:51.000 whoever calls you up on the phone, they hear the same, the solar people, right?
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:55.000 The solar people call you all the time or the power company calls you with this or the cable company,
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000 the other cable company calls you with their offer.
01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000 They hear the same objections all the time.
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:00.000 You know what I mean?
01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000 So they train for those for sure.
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000 And the other of coming out of bonds and they're like, hey, you know,
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000 hey, you know, hey, come here.
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000 I got something to check this out is the ones where you can do,
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000 sponsor child, one of those kinds of things, right?
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.000 So I was like, hey, you know, yeah, you know, we, we don't eat,
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.000 but we like to research and look into it and before I could really finish the sentence,
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000 I was going to say we, I like to look into all the programs that we donate to or think or consider
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000 donating to before I could finish the sound right when I finished the sentence.
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000 He was like, a lot of people are concerned about where the money goes and all the stuff and he knew everything
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000 as a body's guys are getting in that.
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000 There they are.
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000 Emma.
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000 So he's prepared. He rehearsed.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000 Good for him.
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000 It was trained.
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000 Next question.
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.000 Joko for the podcast.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000 What's your opinion on calisthenics versus weights?
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:58.000 Again, for me, both.
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:05.000 You know, with calisthenics, you get that endurance strength, you get some flexibility and
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000 some mobility out of it.
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000 They're pretty natural movements, right?
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000 They're pretty natural movements.
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000 They're things that you're doing with your human body.
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000 So they're going to be more natural.
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000 Wates.
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000 Obviously, make you stronger.
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000 More explosive.
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000 Add a certain point.
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000 They also can be more injury-inducing.
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:33.000 So there's a certain point where if you have an injury in your shoulder and you normally
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:40.000 would do handstand pushups, which means you're lifting up 230 pounds, well, with weight training,
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000 you could lift up 40 pounds if you want to.
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:46.000 So there's it goes both ways where sometimes calisthenics might be the more injury-inducing thing.
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000 And sometimes weight training might be the more important.
01:59:49.000 --> 02:00:01.000 That's the way you've got to balance the two of them.
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:08.000 And for instance, when I, if I, like, hurt my ankle, a couple months ago, and I could not
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000 put any weight on the scrap art.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:16.000 So I was just doing, you know, pistols and, you know, air squats, jumps and box jumps.
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000 You know, as using things that didn't have any weight because I could do all that, but the minute I put weight on my back,
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:26.000 you know, anything above body weight, it started to hurt.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000 And so I just needed to let that thing heal.
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000 And I used the calisthenics to get me there.
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000 And then the same exact opposite I had, my shoulder was tweaked six months ago.
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.000 And I was having a hard time doing handstand pushups because it was just a wrong angle.
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000 And so I was just using, just using, I was doing press with a lighter weight than my body.
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:51.000 In order to keep the blood moving in order to keep the, in order to keep the system moving.
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000 Because that's what I think you've got to do.
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000 So I think you've got to be, you've got to find a balance of both, which means,
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000 which means I'm not great at either one of them.
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000 I'm not going to win in any weightlifting competitions.
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.000 And I'm not going to win in a gymnastics competition either.
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000 And there are some guys, especially now.
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:15.000 I mean, there are some guys that are getting in sick shape.
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000 You know, you watch the guys in the CrossFit games right now.
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000 They're savages.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000 And they're doing both the calisthenics and the weightlifting.
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000 And I just reading something about it the other day.
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000 And it's becoming more weightlifting focused.
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000 You know, whether it's a one weightweight.
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000 What is CrossFit?
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000 Okay.
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000 I shouldn't say it's getting that more focused.
02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000 But if you want to win the CrossFit games,
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000 you've got to be able to lift some heavy weights.
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000 You've got to be able to deadlift a lot.
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000 Snatch a lot, clean and jerk a lot.
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000 And if you can deadlift a lot, clean and jerk a lot.
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000 And snatch a lot, you're going to be able to do.
02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000 And at least you practice the other movements, the muscle of the pull-ups.
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:03.000 You're going to be much more apt to be able to do those things than the other way around.
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000 So, I mean, it's for somebody that can,
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:16.000 somebody that can do a bodyweight snatch is more likely to be able to do 50 pull-ups in a row.
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000 Then somebody that's able to do 50 pull-ups in a row.
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000 And that's their focus in life is able to automatically do a bodyweight snatch.
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000 I mean, that's just the reality of it.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000 That's what I think right now.
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000 But the bottom line is on those.
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000 I use both of them.
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000 I like to try and find that balance.
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000 And I think I use both of them according to what my body prescribes me.
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:46.000 And a lot of this stuff, I'm going to put in the ebook together.
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000 The fitness ebook.
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000 So, I got some folks that are helping me out with it.
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:55.000 And they're going to, you know, I'm going to put these,
02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.000 these things into the fitness ebook.
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000 At some point, I don't know when it's going to get out.
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000 And stuff takes a long, you don't think it's going to take long.
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.000 But it does.
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:06.000 It takes long.
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:11.000 It's the calcettings versus weights.
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000 It depends fully on what result you want.
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000 That is true.
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000 So, and I think a lot of times you speak kind of from the same, you know,
02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000 with the same results in mind.
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:26.000 But like, if you want to put on muscle mass,
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000 it's real cutting dry that weight is going to help you.
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:33.000 And you know what's in my opinion,
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.000 interesting with, like, kind of calcettings.
02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000 Let's say body weights quats, right?
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000 Anything where you're pushing your own body through space.
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000 Not necessarily with the weight, but as far as that exercise has more
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000 neuromuscular activation.
02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000 So, if you do squats rather than leg press,
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000 that has more neuromuscular activation.
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000 Oh, yeah.
02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000 But I mean, I'm not saying that the,
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000 but you're talking about also weighted squats.
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000 Yes, exactly.
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000 Yeah, yeah, for sure.
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000 But yeah, so basically what I'm saying is it's kind of,
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000 I haven't used any kind of weight lifting machine
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000 and I don't remember how long.
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000 Yeah.
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000 So like curls, you know, I always do curls all the time.
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000 Like if you did.
02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000 Close your body, so somebody posted,
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:25.000 somebody posted a picture of some of the bumper stickers
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:26.000 on their squat rack.
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000 And somebody said, we need to make a bumper sticker
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000 that said like, this is a no curl.
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000 Yeah, which I got to, which I got to big kick out.
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000 And you know what, though?
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000 I will say this.
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:39.000 That being said, I don't think I've said that this.
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000 Sure.
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000 I'll tell you what, I have a bicep that's been a little bit
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000 bothersome.
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000 You know, it's got a little tweak in it.
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:46.000 Like that for a while.
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.000 Yeah, it's been like that for a while.
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:47.000 Yeah.
02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000 And I actually will now do some curls.
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:54.000 To get just to get that full range of motion
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000 with some weight on it.
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000 And I feel like that is I feel like I should have
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000 kept doing curls.
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:03.000 And maybe I injured my bicep a little bit
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000 from the lack of some focus training around it.
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:07.000 I could be wrong.
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000 I could be wrong, but I feel suspect of my training methodology
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000 because I hadn't done curls in a long, long time
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000 because you know, you're thinking, hey, why would I do curls
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000 when I could do cleans, right?
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000 Sure.
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000 That's sort of a, that's my mentality.
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000 But now I think, you know what?
02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.000 Do cleans and then do curls too.
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000 Yeah.
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000 You know, work the bicep and the same thing with the
02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000 with the triceps and the same thing with all these,
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000 you know, movements that I kind of pretend to blow off
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000 because they're not full body,
02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000 multi-joint movements, which is sort of the gospel of
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000 strength and conditioning.
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.000 You know, I want to do squats.
02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:44.000 I want to do deadlifts.
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:45.000 I want to do clean jerks.
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:48.000 I want to do these movements where I'm using my whole body.
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000 But I think, you know what?
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000 Why not accent those with
02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000 some a little bit more focused just for the
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.000 the additional work on a focused area and the benefit
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000 that that gives you of strength in that specific spot.
02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000 So yeah.
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000 I'm sure I'd love to hear some opinions about that on,
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000 you know, some of you get some feedback to me and tell me
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:16.000 I'm either an idiot or that those are correct.
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000 And if I, I hope I hear it's correct because I'll do it
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000 more than I do right now.
02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000 What? Like curls and stuff?
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000 Just just more focused on focused body part exercises.
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.000 Well again, and I think this is really important.
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:31.000 And of course, you're working out for you, of course.
02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000 I mean, that's just the nature of working out.
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:36.000 You can't, someone else can't get your results from your working out.
02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000 Right.
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:42.000 So again, like I said, it depends on what you want out of working out
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000 through. So you know how you just said, like,
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000 that's the gospel of strength and conditioning.
02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.000 It's not a full body weight.
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000 So you prefer these things.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:53.000 That's not everybody. You know, so so if, let's say someone who's,
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000 you know, he's worked in office or whatever, he wants to lose some weight.
02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000 Or he's kind of a, you know, more of a skinny person.
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.000 And he wants to put on muscle mass for a bunch of reasons.
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000 And he wants to get stronger.
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000 He wants to be able to like push.
02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000 But those people should do squat and deadlift.
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:06.000 Sure.
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000 Yeah. Agreed.
02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:12.000 But if you want to put on muscle mass like in your shoulders or your arms,
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000 both everything, you do these other things, curls.
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:16.000 Yeah.
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000 And you know, not everyone's for that.
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:22.000 But that's not to say that that's not a beneficial type of workout.
02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000 Yeah. That's a reality.
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.000 Yeah.
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000 Not a reality that I choose to protest.
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000 But you're already kind of, you know, you have muscle mass.
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000 So it's easy, you know.
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000 You say.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:32.000 Yeah.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000 Yes. On hate on the body building program.
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.000 No, not.
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:36.000 There's no hate coming from me.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000 Not watching anyways.
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.000 All right. Cool. Last question.
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000 I'm going to write my ebook on don't hate on the body building.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000 Help me write it.
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000 I want to copy.
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000 Joko.
02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000 Do you ever compromise?
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000 And if so, when?
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:06.000 When you're dealing with other people in dynamic situations and relationships,
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000 deals, you're trying to make things happen, of course. Yes.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000 And so, in fact, I mean, in many aspects, leadership is really all about compromise.
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:28.000 You're about finding the common ground between different teams and merging different approaches to the same problem.
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:38.000 And bridging these personalities of the people that don't get along with each other, that you might not get along with.
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000 And reaching agreements in different courses of actions, all these things.
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000 They all require compromise.
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000 And actually, in many cases, the failure to compromise is a failure to succeed.
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:02.000 That's just the way it is.
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:18.000 And those, of course, those are all external compromises with other people, other human beings that have their own personalities and egos and issues.
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000 And you as a person or I, I have to work with them.
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000 I have to make some compromises with them because they're not me.
02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:38.000 But internally, it's different.
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000 I mean, with myself, I have to hold the line.
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.000 And there's areas within myself where I cannot compromise.
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:55.000 I'm going to work hard. I'm going to train hard.
02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:01.000 I'm going to try and improve myself.
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000 I'm going to own my mistakes.
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000 I'm going to confront them.
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:13.000 I'm going to face my demons.
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.000 And I'm not going to give up or give out or give in.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:23.000 I'm going to stand.
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:31.000 I'm going to maintain my personal self-discipline.
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:51.000 And do my utmost to live a life that is worthy of the sacrifices that were made for me and for us.
02:10:51.000 --> 02:11:01.000 And on those points, there will be no compromise.
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:13.000 Not now, not ever.
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.000 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:27.000 So thanks to all YouTubers out there for tuning in and listening.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:52.000 we did it with Mishedi season. I know it's hard to listen to.
02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000 But I'll tell you.
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:06.000 Doesn't it just make the sunrise in the morning that much more glorious when the light comes in New
