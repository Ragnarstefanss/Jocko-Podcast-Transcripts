[00:00:00] This is Jocopontcast number 202 with echo Charles and me, a jocowilling. Good evening. Good evening.
[00:00:10] On a bright and violent morning in the central Pacific, a dying marine with part of his face shot off
[00:00:18] saved my life.
[00:00:20] He was
[00:00:21] purged to top the partially raised ramp of an LCVP. He was a big solidly built man with a gaping
[00:00:30] gory hole where his eye should have been. Blood streaming from the wound.
[00:00:37] Moments earlier, he had been standing in the water beside me at the bottom of the ramp,
[00:00:42] waiting with the other wounded men for his turn to board. Another casualty in the battle for
[00:00:48] Bayes, you island. I was dying. I'd been shot through the lower abdomen, hit as my unit
[00:00:57] waited toward the shore to assault the island. Two men from my platoon hauled me back to the
[00:01:04] LCVP and struggled to lift me into the boat. The marine with the ravaged face who had just
[00:01:11] boarded. Now saw that they were having trouble with me. He reached down, grabbed me with
[00:01:17] one hand and pulled me up and over the top of the ramp. Amazing. And so I didn't die. That too was
[00:01:31] amazing. But not really all that significant in the grand scheme of things. That incident
[00:01:40] is just a small scene in a very big picture. So an insignificant event like that. Can you
[00:01:53] imagine being gut shot in waste deep water under heavy machine gunfire, barely making it
[00:02:02] back to a landing craft, which is going to save you, being pulled into that landing craft by
[00:02:07] another wounded marine and surviving? Can you imagine considering that series of events to be
[00:02:17] insignificant? It's almost impossible to think that way. But that excerpt is from a book called
[00:02:27] Faithful Warriors, written by Lieutenant Colonel Dean Ladd, who served as an enlisted
[00:02:35] an officer in the Marine Corps in the Pacific Campaign in World War II. He participated
[00:02:42] in the battles for Guadalcanal, Taroa, Sipan, and Tinian. Battles where tens of thousands
[00:02:50] of Americans were wounded or killed as they fought against the fanatical Japanese imperial
[00:02:57] war machine. And while it's impossible for us to understand what those men actually went through
[00:03:06] and what those battles were like. This book does an amazing job of giving us a glimpse into
[00:03:14] this savage part of war. And it is a complete honor to have the author of this book, Dean Ladd,
[00:03:27] here to talk with us about his experiences. Colonel Ladd, welcome to the program. Thank you.
[00:03:36] That's incredible. The things that you went through in this book has been, I could not put this
[00:03:44] book down. And this book is just the picture that it paints of what you all went through in that
[00:03:51] Pacific Campaign is it's unbelievable what you guys went through. It truly is.
[00:04:01] So I guess if we're going to start, I always like to start. I always like to start at the start.
[00:04:09] So for you, go into the book here. It says in early 1939, a boy from the next block came home
[00:04:16] from overseas. And I was never the same become because of it. His name was Lee Preston.
[00:04:22] And he was a corporal on leave from the Marine Corps. He showed up wearing his dress blues,
[00:04:26] creating quite a stern or quiet, spoken neighborhood. Mostly I think the stir was in me. He
[00:04:32] looks so sharp in that uniform and his manner the way he carried himself at once modest,
[00:04:39] but utterly selfish. He got me thinking about myself and my future. I was only a couple years
[00:04:45] younger than Lee, but it didn't seem that way. I was a senior in high school just a teenager,
[00:04:49] still a kid and Lee, well, he was different now. He had changed. He had left home a boy and returned.
[00:04:56] I'm a Marine, a warrior. A man. So the old Marine Corps recruiting process of just sending
[00:05:05] Marines home on leave and their dress uniform worked on you, huh? It really did.
[00:05:12] Ed, what did you know about the Marine Corps at that point in time?
[00:05:16] I bring much. I was being approached by one of the old timers in the local Marine Corps
[00:05:23] reserved, organized and they were trying to get me to join. This was an opportunity to find a
[00:05:31] little bit from another source. What was going to be? What it was like? I was surprised later on thinking
[00:05:38] about this at that time. The Marine Corps was only 20,000. A lot of people that they felt
[00:05:46] forced them to be able to be selected to get in there actually. This is all in 1939 and long before
[00:05:56] we even thought we were going to get in World War II. It wasn't until, not much longer after I joined
[00:06:02] in 1939, that I went to a couple of weeks, just like the National Guard once a week,
[00:06:10] and have to rail right down right close to where we were having this broadcast right now, right across
[00:06:16] the road from us. Then I went to college, Warsaw State University, and had one year, one year of
[00:06:28] college, and went to two encampments with the organizers or one that first one is Sandy Eagle,
[00:06:37] the second one was to Brimerton. Then we got called active duty though in November of 1940.
[00:06:48] That's not very long. It was just a year. That's a year before we got into the war.
[00:06:55] Here we were called and went by two up train and we got about 300 of us at least, and ended up
[00:07:02] with Sandy Eagle, and that was that was for an accampment. Then a year later in November 1940,
[00:07:12] we were called in active duty. We thought we were going to be gone one year, but we were only
[00:07:18] gone what we were going for total of five years. So where were you when Pearl Harbor happened?
[00:07:25] When Pearl Harbor happened, we were in Sandy Eagle, and I was going through a Scott Sniper School,
[00:07:30] and I had a place called Mission Valley. I don't know if you've been to Sandy Eagle lately,
[00:07:35] but Mission Valley is now a mall. Isn't that amazing? That was nothing but a safe Russian
[00:07:42] and a lot of rattlesnakes. So you're going through that Sniper School Pearl Harbor happens,
[00:07:48] and what did they do? They immediately recall you, did they cancel your school? We all had returned
[00:07:54] to the base and we get ready to go here, go there, there was just all kinds of commands going out.
[00:08:03] First of all, hey, what to go here? No, no, we're going to go there and this, all of that.
[00:08:07] And despite of all of that, within one month, well, by first part of January,
[00:08:14] we were board of ship, heading to American Smaller, and to defend that island from the Japanese
[00:08:23] taken over and blocking the supply line from nine states to New Zealand and Australia.
[00:08:32] Now, did the Japanese ever show up? And attack that section of American Samo?
[00:08:36] They didn't for a long time. They would have, if a handman for what's that mean,
[00:08:47] island, and on the other hand, they'd be big battle midway. Midway. Midway. My age and middle
[00:08:53] of the difficult recalling names anymore. It's all good. We got time. So at what point did you get
[00:09:03] the next, the next orders that you are going to not just guard the silent anymore, you guys
[00:09:07] were going to head out? Yeah, about a month before we find a left, we've been training the
[00:09:15] Japanese young men who joined the join the Marine Corps reserve. And they took over the
[00:09:22] guarding each of the little beaches all around the island, somewhere very remote. And so we're
[00:09:30] able to leave and had no idea where we're going. We thought, well, it could be the East Indies,
[00:09:36] who we had no idea. But on the other hand, we know it pretty much is going to be going to go out of
[00:09:43] Kaneal because we were having difficulties there. And somewhere in here, you got your commission
[00:09:48] becoming, and you became an officer. How did that happen? Okay, after we've been on
[00:09:53] small for about three or four months, I was now a corporal at as a squad leader of a machine gun
[00:10:02] like machine gun squad. And I got along very well with the NCOs and with our paternal
[00:10:11] leader. And so I was recommended to go to a machine gun, it was built as a machine gun training
[00:10:20] school. But it turned out it was just to identify likely candidates to become commissioned.
[00:10:30] So I recognize there was probably about, uh, could have been 150 or more of us. And it lasted six
[00:10:38] weeks. And here as a corporal, I was one of those selected to get a field commission.
[00:10:44] And that's it. You had one year of college, they put, put you from corporal to
[00:10:50] second lieutenant. To second lieutenant, and at that time we had no means of even getting
[00:10:55] getting any second Lieutenant bars. It had, it made one down at the, where they were,
[00:11:02] where they're, uh, aircraft were. So you guys just fashioned some, some butter bars for yourself.
[00:11:09] Right, we did. And then, and then next next thing when matter of, and parts first fire, no
[00:11:16] memory, this was only a month after I was commissioned. Uh, here we were bar ship heading to
[00:11:22] Lord knows where and turned out to be Guadalcanale. And here I am entering combat with the same group
[00:11:30] that I had been a list of it before the same company. And I know our first sergeant, he was a
[00:11:37] griffle guy. And he used to read me all like a theater, everybody else. But he saw that any time
[00:11:43] that I was giving a command that he said, you listen to your second lieutenant, you're going
[00:11:48] to have to contend with me. So that was just, it was just wonderful. So I was an extra officer assigned
[00:11:53] to the company headquarters. And that was pretty much the situation they had to have extra officers
[00:12:00] when they got in the casually, they could immediately fill a fill the ranks with, with a new
[00:12:06] pertune commander. And then that's a long story after, right, how I got into the actual
[00:12:11] action of itself. Not knowing how I was going to be able to react as a, as a young lieutenant leader.
[00:12:18] Well, you write about that here. Here, we'll go back to the book and here is you actually
[00:12:23] heading into Guadalcanale. And here we go. I remember thinking as my LCVP chug toward the beach
[00:12:30] that my time had come. And that it would be a time of testing when I would get to show what I was
[00:12:37] made of at last. Even so, a part of me wished I were somewhere else. What if I failed the test?
[00:12:44] Yeah. I was assigned to the headquarters section of B company first battalion as an extra
[00:12:48] second lieutenant with no specific duties other than to follow whatever orders I was given,
[00:12:53] and make myself useful in whatever possible way. The regiment was actually above full strength
[00:12:58] with junior officers to spare. It was an unusual circumstance. And I knew it would suit,
[00:13:02] soon change because junior officers typically suffer the highest casualties relative to the other
[00:13:07] ranks. A Trishin would quickly and inevitably take its toll. Lutonants and command of line units
[00:13:13] would get killed, wounded, injured, and sick. Extra is like me. Would replace them. Inevitably,
[00:13:22] a few junior officers would be relieved for incompetence or cowardice. I prayed that I wouldn't
[00:13:27] be one of them. That I wouldn't turn yellow and let my buddies down when the going got tough.
[00:13:32] A fate worse than death. As for death itself, no worries there. Getting killed was something
[00:13:40] that happened to the other guy. And then arrival, RLCVP's came to a gentle halt at the waterline,
[00:13:48] nosing into the sand of beach red between the Teneru River and Lunga Point. We climbed over the
[00:13:54] sides. There were no ramps on those early model of Higginboats, and we walked onto Guadalcanal.
[00:14:00] We hardly got our trousers wet. We experienced rougher landings during amphibious assault
[00:14:05] exercises outside San Diego. San Chamenie for one. So you're heading into Guadalcanal and there's
[00:14:15] it's a pretty calm entry even though there had been a lot of fighting going on.
[00:14:19] Yeah, previously they had been at that location.
[00:14:23] So once you get on Guadalcanal, you start to move towards the front lines.
[00:14:28] Yeah, in this case it was off of the opposite direction where the front lines were. The
[00:14:35] Japanese had landed. We waste south of us and there was concern that they were going to come
[00:14:41] in and develop us from that location. So our regiment moved out to Hedomoff and going through
[00:14:52] jungle and at night. We didn't know where we were. We'd finally got up to an army up at
[00:15:04] the 164th from the quotas. They had just ended up shooting each other just the day before.
[00:15:13] Here we saw blood all over the place from that situation. We ended up at night and we just had to
[00:15:21] stop right along a river bank and I had my feet dangling in the water at the time. So anyway,
[00:15:30] we never did with the Japanese. They're all suddenly disappeared from that particular location.
[00:15:36] But that was a try. Quite a try in time. Just what it's like to move into combat. Not
[00:15:42] no one's going to happen next. You know one thing that I talk about a lot is the possibility
[00:15:48] of friendly fire occurring. Yeah, exactly what happened. I know I had friendly fire incidents happen
[00:15:54] with me in Iraq and this happened to you as well. I'm going to the book here. You've been moving
[00:16:01] for a while and you're holding up at night and you guys are in your position then all of a sudden
[00:16:06] bang someone yelled another shot fired. Yeah. And then another and then another several shots and
[00:16:12] quick succession all from our foxholes. More shots all at once and just the whole company shooting,
[00:16:18] firing every which way shooting and shouting grenades with their own bursting left and right,
[00:16:22] front and to my rear explosions and muzzle blasts lift the area like popping flash bolts.
[00:16:27] Corporal Lane was hitting the arm a minor wound but he didn't think that it was minor. He panicked
[00:16:33] and shouted out to Sergeant Wimpy right. Top my my arm shot off. Since right and
[00:16:38] Lane were best buddies. A show of concern from the first sergeant might have might in the circumstances
[00:16:43] have been expected and when certainly have been warranted. But right and old salt, who is
[00:16:47] crusty as they come was not practiced and showing concern even to best buddies who had been wounded
[00:16:52] in combat. Muddering just loud enough to make himself heard above the racket. Right replied,
[00:16:57] shut up you fool. You want to let them know where I am? The shooting continued. More grenades
[00:17:02] exploded. PFC Harold Park, a bargarner with first platoon,
[00:17:05] realized that several men just to his left were throwing grenades all around the darn place. The
[00:17:10] guys were just having a little hang grenade war with each other. Maybe the Japanese were out there
[00:17:16] too tossing a few grenades of their own but parked in think so. He stayed low and didn't fire his weapon.
[00:17:21] I didn't figure would do any good even if they were Japanese. You couldn't see nothing.
[00:17:25] All you could do is park was a half Korean and half I have Irish.
[00:17:33] Yes sir. I had a lot of contact with them after the war as well.
[00:17:38] So it was important for him to because I know you say in the book that that he inherited his
[00:17:44] father's looks not as mothers. So he looked more Korean. We told him he'd better stay close.
[00:17:52] Yeah that's a rough one. So you get done with this. This just happening basically all night.
[00:18:01] I mean crazy fire fights and you don't even know if there's any Japanese.
[00:18:05] Well that's time. My Murdoch Murdoch was acting a company commander at that time and
[00:18:13] man near him got shot through the abdomen area and he's more concerned that he lost it
[00:18:19] a lot of his private parts. What are you doing?
[00:18:25] Now was Murdoch? Did Murdoch have experience from some of the other campaigns?
[00:18:30] No he was just like the rest of us. We're all new to combat.
[00:18:36] Speaking of near misses and whatnot, you're waiting to do a link up and here we go back to the book.
[00:18:43] I thought I might grab a quick bite to eat and start to open my sea ration can.
[00:18:47] In the process I somehow managed to cut my thumb to the bone. Blood gust from the wound and I
[00:18:52] spent some frantic moments applying a field dressing to stomp the flow. The noncombs and enlisted men
[00:18:57] watched me probably trying hard not to laugh at me. I still have a scar right there and that's
[00:19:01] thumb from that. And they're watching their thinking second lieutenant's are idiots. Hard to
[00:19:07] argue with that assessment which the lower ranks held as virtually at axiomatic. And I just given
[00:19:14] them another reason for their certified how humiliating and annoying the cut would not fully heal as long
[00:19:19] as I remain on Guadalcanal and I still bear a scar from it. Thus far the chief dangers in Guadalcanal
[00:19:24] posed to my well being it come from one my buddies via friendly fire and two myself. The
[00:19:30] Japanese in comparison had been a relatively benign presence. There are a couple of situations right
[00:19:36] at that same time that happened. One was a young marine from another outfit. He was a real bad
[00:19:42] he thought he was he's really good there. He says I'm used to all this stuff. And here he had a
[00:19:48] Japanese skull hanging from a from a court of some sort and he was just swinging that around crazy.
[00:19:55] Then a little bit later within within an hour or so we had a big air rain just hundreds of
[00:20:00] Japanese planes dropped drop bombs on us. And then I was watching one of our an aircraft cruise
[00:20:08] cruiseers shooting at him and many of their planes dropped at that time. But that was that was really
[00:20:15] a really getting into it in deep way but not really directly in direct wire at the time.
[00:20:21] So that time that kid that you talk about and you mentioned in the book this is sort of the
[00:20:27] so he's a guy that had been fighting somewhere else and he comes back and so this is the first
[00:20:31] person that you see that you look at that's starting to be you know he's having some let's see how
[00:20:37] did you put it he had acclimated to conditions on Guadalcanal that's what you wrote and you know
[00:20:43] however long that takes before you know it's a different it's a different it's a different environment
[00:20:50] it's a completely different mindset and that's what he was doing. Now these all these young people
[00:20:57] they all had beers now you know they haven't shaved for a long time and they they had the
[00:21:02] hand hand up food really the reading Japanese rice and whatnot because our transfers all had to
[00:21:08] leave they loaded off the troops but most of the mature all of the food stuff they were able
[00:21:16] to unload so they had eat this Japanese food so anyway they were pretty good looking people
[00:21:21] but even so they were full of they were full of full of fight you could tell young people and
[00:21:27] you know young guys that are in their teens still you know you get into this
[00:21:34] uh...
[00:21:36] motton account and i say that right the motton account metan account yeah
[00:21:40] metan account uh... this this river
[00:21:45] this offensive that you guys start on ten november which is the hundred sixty seven
[00:21:49] anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps and here we go to the book separating
[00:21:53] our forces from their geographical objective of coastal village with some four miles of
[00:21:57] of exceptionally rugged terrain grassy ridges falling away steeply to jungle choke ravines
[00:22:03] in several thousand japanese infantry men also exceptionally rugged
[00:22:07] our mission objective was to engage defeat and destroy the enemy formations in our path
[00:22:12] our assault units advanced solely but steadily against the term in resistance the eighth
[00:22:16] marines ordered to move up in column behind the two seven filed across a narrow pontoon bridge
[00:22:23] over the motton account metan account and continue to short distance before halting for new
[00:22:28] in child as before the sweep to call the point we encountered no japanese the attacking
[00:22:34] units are driven them off but we suffered casualties just the same
[00:22:38] that's it's been a bit about there we were we had the child uh... there were many japanese
[00:22:44] bodies lying about some had been partially buried some of the eggs are still sticking
[00:22:48] up uh... there been a major battle between between them attacking
[00:22:53] the other rains that have been there just before we were weeks before
[00:22:57] and here all these mung all these bodies and flies and maggots everything was
[00:23:02] so we ate among all of that
[00:23:05] yeah your sense of some some guys would
[00:23:07] could couldn't even carry on barely because it smelled so bad yeah yeah yeah
[00:23:13] this right near a place called point crews by the way and today it is a city well
[00:23:19] of over twenty thousand that's the capital of the of the cell of solman islands
[00:23:25] at this point you actually say in the book as you were sitting there amongst all these
[00:23:29] bodies these dead bodies and as you're sitting there eating your child
[00:23:34] you say like that kid twirling the skull i was acclimating to the conditions on
[00:23:39] guadal canal i'd been on the island for seven days
[00:23:44] so that's an indication to you
[00:23:47] so then you guys later that day and enemy unit penetrator online and ambush weapons
[00:23:51] patoon killing three marines with a burst of enemy fire with with a burst of machine gun fire
[00:23:55] and then the entire offensive had suddenly been called off
[00:23:59] and not only that we're gonna give up the ground we had taken relinquishing it to the
[00:24:03] japanese what the hell we thought
[00:24:06] so you get told hey you guys stop attacking
[00:24:11] the reason was which you'll get into in this a bit
[00:24:14] is that there's a major task force the japanese
[00:24:18] but twelve transfers full of troops can you imagine
[00:24:22] and uh... battleship and cruisers and lot of destroyers
[00:24:26] and they they were gonna they were gonna just
[00:24:29] knock us off of there
[00:24:30] we had we had we didn't have a good feel that it was that dire but boy it
[00:24:35] turned out it was because that
[00:24:38] and when they did come in at night we saw him come in the mid-no-fammer
[00:24:42] and uh... major battle between the naval battle called the naval battle called al canal
[00:24:47] and uh... you never know watching at night time you didn't know
[00:24:51] who's your our ships and which are theirs all sent you see something blow up
[00:24:55] you see red hot shells being fired going back and criss-crossing fact
[00:24:59] back and forth and then the next
[00:25:02] next morning
[00:25:03] he was they have had troops have the uh...
[00:25:07] some are men that there there's their own ships were sunk
[00:25:10] and now they they're all full of oil and they're
[00:25:14] coming up there could now they're landing on our shore
[00:25:17] it was uh... what and here we used
[00:25:19] watching from a grandstand
[00:25:21] viewpoint on a ridge watching all this happen
[00:25:24] and incredible did you did you know that
[00:25:28] this naval battle was about to take place
[00:25:31] didn't know it's gonna be anything like that
[00:25:33] imagine
[00:25:35] roughly twelve transports full of troops
[00:25:38] all but all but three of them were sunk
[00:25:42] and the three that did beech
[00:25:45] the troops got off but all their supplies and stuff
[00:25:49] remained on
[00:25:50] and and we have
[00:25:51] our planes
[00:25:53] bomb bomb that and try our church
[00:25:56] so we had those we we had to reckon
[00:25:59] with those troops that came we got off of those transports
[00:26:03] and the next or the next week or so
[00:26:05] your your description of this battle
[00:26:07] yeah
[00:26:07] is
[00:26:09] is crazy to read i'm gonna read it
[00:26:11] the battle between the american and japanese surface fleets began a little before
[00:26:14] zero to two hundred like a suddenly breaking storm of
[00:26:18] cataclysmic size and power
[00:26:20] in the language of naval tacticians
[00:26:22] the coming together of two fleets in sea-large channel
[00:26:26] constituted what is known as a meeting
[00:26:27] engage in engagement
[00:26:29] but collision engagement is a better term
[00:26:32] for describing what happened steaming more
[00:26:35] or less blindly into the channel of fleets ran into each other at
[00:26:38] oblique angles
[00:26:39] their ships quickly became intermingled resulting in
[00:26:42] a close quarters melee that saw the combatants charging
[00:26:46] madly about their big guns flashing and booming hurling red hot
[00:26:50] shells and high flaming arcs above the channel
[00:26:53] the thunder of the guns rolled across the black water
[00:26:56] a steady pulsating roar and the molten projectile
[00:26:59] streak leg meteors crisscrossing the skies with fiery
[00:27:03] tails rising and falling and crashing into ships and exploding in massive fireballs
[00:27:07] violent secondary explosions caused by ammunition cooking off in the intense heat
[00:27:12] of the detonating shells rock some of the ships and sent them
[00:27:14] furiously ablaze
[00:27:16] blurning like roman candles
[00:27:18] fountains of fire sparking and shooting flames and blasting big chunks of steel
[00:27:22] in every direction all the while star shells and flares burst high above the
[00:27:27] channel and invaded like dying galaxies as they drifted down at the end of their
[00:27:31] parachutes into the extinguishing water
[00:27:34] the canisters that held the flares periodically flew over our positions
[00:27:37] charging like locomotives search lights probe the dirt lower darkness
[00:27:42] with their long brilliant beams sweeping back and forth above the surface
[00:27:46] by secting fixing on some hapless ship bringing the blazing shells down on it
[00:27:51] streams of tracers from automatic cannons and machine guns
[00:27:55] curved through the middle of the air every now and then an
[00:27:58] airant torpedo slammed into the beach below us
[00:28:00] 2500 pounds of explosives blasting a big crater at the waterline
[00:28:06] we watched all this from our foxes on the ridge front row seats to
[00:28:10] a spectacle that john murder john mordocla likened to all the fourth of
[00:28:14] July's I ever saw my life all put together at once
[00:28:18] we were a vocal audience awestruck and profane a ship would explode
[00:28:23] and all up and down the line you'd hear men exclaiming
[00:28:27] cheese a surprise and holy shit and oh my fucking god did you see that
[00:28:32] it was thrilling really you couldn't help but feel that way but i also couldn't
[00:28:37] help at wondering which ships were ours and how we could dis- and how they could
[00:28:41] distinguish friend from foe i thought of the many men who were losing their
[00:28:44] young lives right before our eyes i felt very fortunate to be in safe in my
[00:28:49] foxhole and i wondered who's winning yeah we had no idea who was winning
[00:28:56] yeah just we just knew that what i we had seen a massive combat
[00:29:03] just incredible and we were at a ring side seat
[00:29:07] now as that's going on obviously you have to realize that if the americans don't
[00:29:13] win this thing yeah that was it you guys are done yeah yeah
[00:29:19] can you imagine a convoy like that that many transports
[00:29:24] they they probably matched our numbers at that time if they had got all gotten
[00:29:28] a shore but they didn't yeah
[00:29:35] early the next morning be company crossed the river to spearhead the attack by
[00:29:40] another green army battalion the one the first the 182nd along the coastal flat
[00:29:47] toward the base of point crews so you guys you guys took lead yeah we were
[00:29:53] we were spearheading that particular attack you know you talk about you
[00:29:58] you mentioned to win be right a little earlier and that's a heck of a nick name
[00:30:01] then doesn't sound like it's easy for a couple and thought about that true
[00:30:05] but but we talk about you know a lot of times we talk about leadership on this podcast
[00:30:09] and you do a great description of this kind of transition and the relationship that you had
[00:30:15] with wimpy right i think it's worse well this is this is my co-author Steve
[00:30:19] wine gardener tell you he was he's a he's a great you know he got a award for a
[00:30:26] police woman that that escaped the holy cost okay
[00:30:31] call lala story well we can definitely look into that book yeah oh yeah
[00:30:37] here's how he describes your relationship with him wimpy right was the company's first
[00:30:42] sergeant he was a tough old salt shorten stocky late 30s or 40s old enough to be my
[00:30:47] father old enough for that matted matter to be the father of quite a few of the
[00:30:51] loutenates in the regiment he was going on 20 years in the Marine Corps and it's
[00:30:54] served in china nicaragua and Haiti he was no new comber to war no stranger to combat
[00:30:59] he was also in our terms he possessed a commanding voice which he used in a full
[00:31:05] throated bellow when reading off one of his charges when reading off one of his charges
[00:31:11] for doing something stupid on sumo before i was commissioned i had been one of his charges
[00:31:15] and it usually more than once deservedly been on the receiving end of one of his
[00:31:22] herangs but now i outranked him i was at first uncomfortable with our new relationship
[00:31:29] i found it hard to imagine giving orders to a man who not so long ago had been
[00:31:33] shouting in my face and giving me a dressing down the likes of which i'd never
[00:31:37] experienced before and never would again it wasn't that i was afraid of him rather i
[00:31:42] respected him too much and knew him and knew too well that he was a great marine to think that
[00:31:46] i could or should be telling what to do and i thought that he might resent my status
[00:31:51] and just to be cantankerous make things difficult for me i need never worried about right
[00:31:58] a consummate professional he supported me fully and ceseerly sincerely i should have expected
[00:32:03] that after all it was because of his recommendation that i received my commission he looked
[00:32:09] on me as his protege and he wanted me to succeed in part because my success would reflect well on
[00:32:14] him but mainly because he was generally genuinely proud of me also because i was a known quantity
[00:32:21] whom he had personally mentored he much preferred me to be giving orders rather than some 90
[00:32:26] day wonder fresh out of training in the states since he had taught me everything i knew he was
[00:32:30] confident that in combat together we would more or less be thinking along the same lines and
[00:32:35] important connection for a top sergeant to have with his petoon leader nor did he know what he
[00:32:40] broke the slightest in subordination toward me from anyone else in the petoon you obey your lieutenant
[00:32:45] or you'll have to answer to me he growled at my guys and you could be damn sure they did nobody
[00:32:50] wanted to have to answer to right sounds like an outstanding marine i'm pretty soon you're going
[00:32:57] again me getting into a part is my my first encounter of very close calls was losing my life
[00:33:09] on hill 78 second platoon was dealing with a lone sniper who had fired on us from the open
[00:33:15] trees on the coastal flap of below he was high up in one of those trees high enough to place
[00:33:20] my little above the hilltop allowing him to shoot down to us at a shallow angle he pottered us
[00:33:25] pottered us for a better part of four hours and then by the buy and buy and much to my astonishment
[00:33:32] a lieutenant i didn't recognize came strolling along in the ridge fully upright fully exposed
[00:33:37] this sniper smirking at us i was lying on the belly on my belly in the grass and he approached me
[00:33:42] saying i would be worried about that sniper can't hit me one in the next instant a shot rang out
[00:33:47] and a bullet wing disarm can't get complacent uh you continue on i didn't much care where that
[00:33:57] lieutenant won or what happened to him i wanted to get that sniper i pulled out my field glasses
[00:34:01] and scan the trees below our position as luck would have it i spotted the sniper almost at once that
[00:34:07] is i spotted his pude wrapped legs and booted feet dangling from the limb of a huge banyan
[00:34:13] tree about 150 yards from my position i lifted the field glasses a notch to the clump of
[00:34:17] leaves where those above those legs i couldn't see him but he had to be there japanese legs
[00:34:23] were always attached to japanese bodies just then he took a shot at me he must have seen me looking
[00:34:29] maybe my field glasses glinting the sun and give me a way his bullet hit the ground just
[00:34:33] inches from my nose sprang dirt my face i dropped my field glasses and snatched up my spring field
[00:34:39] firing from the prone position i unloaded the entire clip at the clump of leaves above his feet
[00:34:44] five shots one after the other working the bolt quickly put smooth me but smoothly so it's
[00:34:49] not spoiled my aim just as i had been taught to do and just as i had practiced on the Marine
[00:34:54] Coriful ranges i didn't think about it i didn't have to think all that training just kicked right
[00:34:59] in and i killed the man who had been trying to kill me he didn't drop from the tree he didn't
[00:35:03] drop his rifle but that was to be expected japanese snipers customarily tied themselves and the
[00:35:08] rifles to the trees bottom line he didn't shoot at us after that he was dead all right the first man i
[00:35:14] had killed yes that's my first my first call the first call the first call of life having around hit
[00:35:24] right front of your face i'm not gonna dirt my face oh he he spotted me i was no longer somebody
[00:35:33] to harass i was somebody it was gonna kill him now we had a dog a dog going on all right
[00:35:44] the eighth Marines first and second battians were to advance by side in columns in tourvine
[00:35:49] then attack and capture hill 83 ridge line the first battalion was to move forward on the right
[00:35:56] be company would lead in the battians advance and my platoon would lead the company's advance
[00:35:59] so that you put you does that put your company right your your company right at the front
[00:36:05] yeah that you're pulled to and right at the front of the company and we were at that time we
[00:36:08] we were right and red in the crux of it following it our an artillery bombardment second
[00:36:14] platoon with the rest of the battalion behind it passed through the army lines and advanced into the
[00:36:18] ravine enemy machine guns and riflemen fired down on us from concealed positions on the ridge
[00:36:23] some 75 yards ahead and above us machine guns chattered rut relentlessly ripping through the jungle
[00:36:30] rustling foliage clipping branches and leaves corporal Olson de Moss and his squad led the way moving
[00:36:36] up out of the ravine and onto the ridge suddenly a voice shouted baker company get off the
[00:36:41] ridge huh i looked around at my man who gave that order most of my men had gone to ground hiding
[00:36:47] in the bush as and were invisible to the Japanese that's the nature of jungle warfare everyone tries
[00:36:52] to stay hidden you can hardly see anyone either enemy or friendly the battlefield seems empty
[00:36:57] and you feel and you can feel alone and isolated on it especially when you're in command especially
[00:37:01] when in the middle of a firefight and when somebody else starts giving orders to your men
[00:37:05] I looked around and a few of the men I could see stared back at me there there are
[00:37:09] ex-blank expressions a firm denial it wasn't me a few minutes later de Moss and his squad
[00:37:14] returned to the ravine having relinquished their brief hold on the ridge top somebody although
[00:37:18] us to get off de Moss explained he thought one of our guys had given the order then we both
[00:37:24] realized what had happened those clever Japanese one of them someone flutten American English had given
[00:37:29] that order very clever he must be pleased with himself he must be laughing at us just about now
[00:37:34] him and his men laughing and how did he know that we were baker company you heard us heard
[00:37:41] us say that that's it now we're going to get a little bit a little bit later than this now I take
[00:37:46] over the puttoon second puttoon they puttoon later was yellow he wouldn't he wouldn't get
[00:37:52] up out of his hole so now I'm in charge and you're going to get into what the close calls I had
[00:37:58] there are boy they were they were mighty close unbelievable I don't know how I survived it
[00:38:07] yeah going back to this we risen to our uphill attack and we were met with more devastating
[00:38:11] machine gun and rifle fire so would you say this this engagement right here is the first time
[00:38:17] that you were under real oh yeah okay yeah other than getting bombed other than having
[00:38:25] area of attack other than it's not for shooting this this was it this is it is about a closest
[00:38:31] close to a call in second be I tell you we kept going for going forward firing on the move leaning
[00:38:37] slightly into the incline shooting from the shoulder and hip firing blindly at the top of the ridge
[00:38:41] we couldn't see the enemy but we knew he was up there dimos on my left banged away with his
[00:38:44] springfield just as fast as he could work the bolt and that his rifle seeves seized up dimos
[00:38:49] looked at me and I looked at him and the spell was broken just like just that fast I came out
[00:38:53] of my battle trance I felt very exposed and insecure judging by the wide eyed look he gave me
[00:38:59] dimos felt the same dimos inspectors rifle discovered that he had a bullet had pierced his magazine
[00:39:05] barely missing the nose his nose in the process he never cursed never uttered profanities and now
[00:39:11] true to form his big eyes still as saucers his eyes still as big as saucers he exclaimed
[00:39:16] well I'll be a dirty name then he discarded his rifle and started throwing grenades at the top of the
[00:39:21] ridge the reality of our sudden harrowing plight then struck me this was my first major combat
[00:39:28] test as a platoon leader and I realized that I had to take immediate and firm control of myself
[00:39:34] I could not show fear in front of my men a couple feet to my right private McCoy Reynolds had
[00:39:39] been hurling grenades one after the other each time courageously standing up and exposing himself
[00:39:44] to enemy fire he crouched down next to me and scanned the top of the ridge then he exclaimed I see
[00:39:49] them and threw another grenade in the next instant he was shot through the neck killed instantly
[00:39:55] he fell at my feet for a moment I just looked at him his eyes wide open lifeless stared back at me
[00:40:00] then I realized that now more than ever I had to get a grip on things and seize control
[00:40:05] of what was becoming an increasingly chaotic situation I decided at once we needed support from our
[00:40:11] mortars and backed a little way down the ridge out of the field of fire to further assess the situation
[00:40:22] now at the same time we were running low on an ammunition as well and we sent back call we need
[00:40:28] more ammunition next thing we know bandaliar after bandaliar of ammunition started arriving
[00:40:34] just the same as same Guided guys now that's an interesting I mean you recognized
[00:40:41] that that you needed to get control of your emotions
[00:40:48] is that something you would thought about what made you realize that what made you realize oh wow
[00:40:53] I better do something because I'm in charge and I need to make some decisions here I don't I don't
[00:40:59] know all of a sudden fear went away I guess I didn't have fear right at that time
[00:41:06] and it's also interesting but I saw the dire situation here we were in a situation that
[00:41:12] we we had we we were committed and either to keep going or are we gonna back up then back off
[00:41:21] finally we were called back down and now knowing that that that's the same kind of movement
[00:41:26] went clear to the top and decided to just call off that drive in general here I was at the
[00:41:33] I was at the spares head right there it was called off and they just said that the general
[00:41:40] from the top on down was that okay we stopped going after him and losing troops and that's just
[00:41:48] let him try in the vine well yeah because at this point you had we controlled we controlled
[00:41:55] all the ways we controlled this up we had taken out their supplies so let's do some siege warfare
[00:42:00] and make them wait yeah make them star so wait we had no more fighting we had a firm
[00:42:09] the fans line along a ridge for a month just just held a line continue with these setting up
[00:42:16] reconnaissance patrols next year you know are they doing what they were doing and I led
[00:42:21] Denver reconnaissance patrol myself taking out four or five men with me and finding out where they were
[00:42:27] that was scary situation to all these reconnaissance patrols you know right before they before they
[00:42:33] stopped that as you're still pushing forward up that ridge you got some great detail in here that's
[00:42:38] absolutely worth talking about going to the book here the ammunition was quickly distributed so
[00:42:44] you called for ammunition the ammunition was quickly distributed and once again we moved up hill
[00:42:48] shooting as we went another of my man men private Walter Cuss was favorally hit while scouting up the
[00:42:55] ridge from a different direction at the moment of his death he exailed the his last breath
[00:43:00] and that out a long rising how of pain and anguish like a dying animal yeah didn't sound like
[00:43:06] human being several attempts were made to reach him and dragon back all on successful
[00:43:11] PFC James Bell said I'm going up there all bring him down he was often running before anyone could
[00:43:18] stop him yeah on his own he did that and he was shot through the chest well before reaching Cuss's body
[00:43:25] we were able to retrieve Bell and he was still alive as we cared him down and out of a line of fire
[00:43:30] but he was just about gone he had a sucking chest wound that made it increasingly difficult to breathe
[00:43:36] hoping about size he couldn't breathe you see
[00:43:38] this was the first time I had seen such a wound and it was a terrible sight our corpsman tried
[00:43:43] to patch him up but there was little he could do a sucking chest wound needs to be sealed internally
[00:43:48] as well as externally and the corpsman could only treat the outside finally Bell said it looks like
[00:43:54] this is goodbye and then he calmly died just like in the movies I thought with his last words and
[00:44:01] everything yeah soon after that we quit attacking and withdrew we couldn't dislodge the enemy from the
[00:44:08] ridge we had been defeated our losses were heavy my Patuna loan suffered seven casualties four
[00:44:16] killed Reynolds Bell Cuss and private Robert Cuss three wounded PFC James Harris
[00:44:25] private burnt Mick Bernie and private named Mandraville total casualties for first
[00:44:31] Patallian were nine killed and 23 wounded overall in the period spanning 18 to 23
[00:44:36] November the 8th Marines lost 42 men killed and many more wounded now do I you got in the
[00:44:48] part where a discurory escort was named after Mickoy Reynolds oh I did not know that well let me tell
[00:44:55] you about that yeah my company commander had been a journalist with a with a anorland's paper
[00:45:03] so he's good at writing up things so I recommended recommended something written up on him he wrote
[00:45:09] this up in such a matter that a destroyer escort was named after him that's called in McOed Reynolds
[00:45:15] and it in turn sank to Japanese submarines later on yeah and was that um was that captain LeBlanc
[00:45:25] that you're talking about yes it is so so captain LeBlanc was your company commander at that time
[00:45:31] and it sounds like it sounds like from the book well let me give you your your thoughts on him
[00:45:38] we called him little Napoleon he was notoriously eager to make a name for himself and just as
[00:45:42] notorious not just as notoriously a verse to taking risks his men took the risks and he took the
[00:45:49] credit for their success he would say come on we've got a tough job to do and then he decides
[00:45:53] someone else to do it sometimes he denounced that we were going on an out on a reconnaissance
[00:45:57] platoon and then he turned a Murdoch or me or one of the other junior officers and say hey how about
[00:46:02] you leading it and at one point he tells you to go back to the go back to the army this is
[00:46:11] a secret is darn thing you can imagine you're reading now he he's telling you to go back to the
[00:46:17] army and tell them what you know what the ethical proposition and they ran into the same
[00:46:23] stuff that we did or and they really ran into it really bad so he tells you to go and this is
[00:46:29] what you this is what you write I come all across the ridges east facing slope walking in the
[00:46:34] grass at the edge of the jungle I was beneath the crests and felt reasonably safe the area was
[00:46:38] deserted a true nomans land I found this very disconserting it was eerie so you're alone
[00:46:44] I'm stupid stupid then I came upon the body of an American soldier he lay slightly above me
[00:46:51] and to my right a stride a narrow trail leading to the top rich his abdomen had been torn open
[00:46:56] and his intestines had spilled out and were spread across the ground a grizzly and heart-rending
[00:47:01] sight I heard past him thinking I wonder what his dreams were will that happen to me now he was
[00:47:10] looking at a photograph do you talk about that there no okay he's now he the last thing
[00:47:16] for a died he's looking at a photograph of his family or his girlfriend is laid out there that's
[00:47:22] the last the last as dying as he's dying he was looking at that and you're thinking I wonder what
[00:47:31] his next would have been me that could be me will that happen to me well that happened yet because
[00:47:36] there's you still have a lot of danger here there's still snipers out there shooting at me at this time
[00:47:44] and now you go I arrived at the army cp to find it in turmoil and anxious captain and is
[00:47:50] visibly agitated staff stood around a field radio listening to a report from the front line emanating
[00:47:55] from the speaker where the sounds of battle mix with the crackling of static a frightened voice crying
[00:48:00] out we're taking a lot of fire put two liter hit leg blown off get us out of here
[00:48:08] I could hear the actual sounds of the battle outside not too far away machine guns rifle fire
[00:48:13] grenades mortars the usual mayhem I reported to the commanding officer and told him what I knew
[00:48:18] and I left the cp laid out close by where's many as a dozen bodies covered with ponchos I
[00:48:25] hurried on instead of staying low on the slope I headed over toward the top of the ridge I don't
[00:48:28] he was interested in hearing me he's already in a so darn deep he didn't care about any more
[00:48:33] detail see he knew he was in a over his hand yeah it's old information met this point yeah
[00:48:43] when I reached the top of the ridge I snuck my head I stuck my head over the crest in the next
[00:48:47] incident Japanese machine gun cut loose at me with a long burst sending a streamable
[00:48:51] it's snapping just inches above the head that brought me to my senses and I ran down the slope
[00:48:56] into the jungle I stood there for a minute grap gasping for breath shaking and thinking holy smokes
[00:49:01] almost bought the farm on that one holy smokes
[00:49:05] that count is one of your close calls micro close yeah yeah that's what I'm now you've already
[00:49:17] covered two of them now two out of eight there's actually there's there's three more on Guadalcanale
[00:49:26] that you'll get to in a subiet well what do they say a cat has nine lives so luckily we only have
[00:49:31] eight to cover otherwise the ninth one we wouldn't be here since it's here talking on November 25th
[00:49:39] we were pulled off the line in sent to positions near in the rear near Hendersonfield for the next
[00:49:45] 15 days we slept in open sighted tents on the grove of coconut palms on ground that was
[00:49:50] saw from frequent heavy rain showers there was always a possibility that Japanese warships
[00:49:55] would foray and to see large channel during the night and throw a few hundred large cowlblows shells
[00:50:02] into our soggy environments but these dangers were negligible compared to what we had recently
[00:50:06] been through on the front line and we did not worry about them actually we did not worry about
[00:50:10] much of anything we were emotionally and physically drained and lacked both energy and inclination
[00:50:16] to worry we mostly sat around doing nothing partly because we had nothing much to do but also
[00:50:22] because we were sort of in a days you might say we were numb it was not it was not an unpleasant
[00:50:28] state we were purely glad to be alive and the fact that no one was shooting at us at least not
[00:50:33] directly or intentionally made us feel downright you fork we were living for the moment and for the moment
[00:50:39] everything was fine and we were content see now we're coming down with malaria as well you see
[00:50:46] now the other thing you go into here which is interesting is during this period of number
[00:50:52] Marines took steps to upgrade their personal armament the main object of their desire was the
[00:50:58] superb M1 grand semi-automatic rifle that had been issued to the army this still had the old ones
[00:51:04] the model 1903 springfield we carried was a fine weapon but it was obsolete the old salts loved
[00:51:11] the O3 like a Viking loves his broad sword but the kids were unsend metal about the rifle because
[00:51:16] they had no history with it so you say while some Marines acquired their M1s through honest
[00:51:23] scrounging in battlefield scavenging others resorted to outright theft and you go through some
[00:51:30] methods that that were used to do that who is also moonlighting you guys had Tommy Guns
[00:51:36] which you said weren't really all that great for most of the purposes the rising
[00:51:42] you know for a while we even had shotgun you know yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November
[00:51:53] at Japanese beginning the beginning using the flame source as well is there too at that time
[00:51:59] rough weapon right there oh yeah on the night of 30 to 31 November a Japanese task force
[00:52:09] steamed in the sea large channel of bringing food to the Belieger Japanese forces on Guadalcanal
[00:52:13] our warships sailed forth to intercept it meeting the enemy fleet in that off-to-speweded gap
[00:52:18] between savvoiled and Guadalcanal just off Tassa Farango how do you say that it's right
[00:52:23] Tassa Farango point because our Bivolac was situated inland on low ground I heard the battle but
[00:52:29] did not see it our fleet took an awful beating one of our heavy cruisers the North Hampton was
[00:52:35] struck by two torpedoes within a matter of seconds consumed by fire she sank a few hours later
[00:52:41] you're still sure the heavy crew cruisers Minneapolis Minneapolis New Orleans and Pensacola
[00:52:47] were severely damaged and the sailors were coming off off of an off cover with oil
[00:52:52] and so would they swim into shore some did probably did it was right near the shore
[00:52:58] yeah the battle had been a clear tactical victory for the Japanese but a strategic defeat
[00:53:05] the task force had failed with its primary mission to deliver food to the Japanese army on Guadalcanal
[00:53:11] this was a calamitous development for the Japanese even before the battle their food stocks were
[00:53:17] desperately not low now they began falling below substance levels the entire enemy army was
[00:53:23] growing physically weaker because the soldiers simply didn't have enough to eat
[00:53:29] we were in better shape than the Japanese overall but only in a relative sense the first marine
[00:53:33] division in particular was greatly reduced by illness and sheer exhaustion as well as by battle casualties
[00:53:40] it had suffered in four months of fighting yeah a large number of its men were unfit for duty
[00:53:46] and many more were only marginally capable of rendering effective frontline service the
[00:53:50] high command recognizing that the entire division had just about reached the end of its
[00:53:54] operation utility pulled it off the front lines began sending it units to Australia starting on nine
[00:53:59] December yeah so they after my birthday December it's so you wave goodbye to those guys as they're
[00:54:07] leaving and meanwhile on 11 December the 8th marine's resume returned to the ridges yeah right
[00:54:14] but we didn't really take off until first part of the January I guess and the final drive
[00:54:20] and then so it's you on one set of ridges and the Japanese were on the other side they were usually
[00:54:25] somewhere right on the first slope in front of us they were dug in like gulfers like gulfer holes
[00:54:32] but most are more further back on the next over the next next ridge so there'd be you on one
[00:54:39] day they would come up close no so hang on a zed us heard so hang on a zed each other all right
[00:54:47] these dispositions meaning these two ridges that you guys had occupied both ours and those
[00:54:52] the enemy remained substantially unchanged for the next 34 days yeah the brass anxious to void
[00:54:59] a repeat performance of the november battles in order to temporary halt to large scale offensive
[00:55:03] operations instead we were told to hold the line and harass the enemy with aggressive patrols and
[00:55:08] raids in the meantime our air and naval forces would strive to introduce the Tokyo Express which is
[00:55:15] their supply chain now while we were at that location there was a sergeant from the Jason company
[00:55:23] and he had a tummy gun and he didn't enough at enough action going on where he was
[00:55:29] steady was coming down the line where there's air reaction he wanted to get into it well he came
[00:55:33] he came right by where I was and no one in two months when great was right shortly after that one
[00:55:40] of our one of our rounds dropped in short he lost two legs in an arm and he was in there's
[00:55:48] an article in the said reading post about it and saying that at least I have the right arm to
[00:55:53] wrap the bar with for a drink I'll tell about it and there's some too
[00:55:59] words uh you guys that during this you also talk about the fact that you would be young
[00:56:07] stuff back and forth to the Japanese they're a little bit a little bit they'd be yelling at you
[00:56:13] guys and you'd yell back at them and it sounds like during the daytime well you say it was during
[00:56:17] the daytime was a policy became one of live and let live during the day of a much different policy
[00:56:24] ruled at night after the case yeah and they were sneaking in on the server now and then make a little
[00:56:30] trying to sneak in and maybe get one of our guys in a fox hole yeah you're going to one of those
[00:56:36] one night during a heavy downport of Japanese crept up from the ravines the sound of their movement
[00:56:41] mass by the falling rain and jump the crew a ferocious hand-a-hand struggle ensued I heard our
[00:56:47] men yelling help oh god they're in our whole help help they're blood curling cries and thrashing sounds
[00:56:53] were plainly audible to everyone in the vicinity there were on a point little bit a little bit
[00:56:57] a head of our regular line and this has gotta be just this is on a mental weedless and
[00:57:03] horrified but stayed in our holes that's how bad it was to get out of your holes you don't dare
[00:57:08] because you you anybody outside the holes enemy suddenly the yelling sounds of the fighting
[00:57:17] ceased we actually waited and listened to pairing through the rain and into the darkness
[00:57:20] then the Japanese begin probing our position all up and down the line running up to the
[00:57:24] crest and chucking a few grenades over the top at our holes and running back down hill after
[00:57:28] the grenades exploded usually harmlessly our guys would leap from their holes dashed to the
[00:57:33] crest and throw grenades at the fleeting enemy then they'd scamper back to their holes and the
[00:57:36] Japanese would return to herle their grenades back and forth and went through the night intervals
[00:57:40] of silence and then flash bang of grenades exploding and men hollering and cursing in the English and
[00:57:45] Japanese the next morning we discovered that one of them men in the machine gun post had been killed
[00:57:50] that's that day and headed to death the others have been wounded but somehow they'd beaten back
[00:57:54] their attackers and you were saying this earlier you we also conducted aggressive patrols
[00:58:03] and probe their lines at giving as good as we got or maybe even better if more frontline
[00:58:07] Japanese soldiers had survived the war maybe be reading memoirs by those veterans of
[00:58:12] Guadalcanal campaign recounting how the US Marines terrorized them at night and terrorized
[00:58:17] them we most certainly did some guys really enjoyed this part of the job teenagers who found
[00:58:23] their true nature in the jungle who discovered that they were born for the warrior life
[00:58:27] there were very there were a few in every unit more than a few actually more than you might expect
[00:58:32] more than I expected they went after the Japanese with a competence and enthusiasm that made
[00:58:37] them almost as frightening to their officers as they must have been to their enemies it was just
[00:58:42] amazing observed Murdoch how you could take kids like these and put them out into the jungle
[00:58:48] and in just a few weeks they'd be great at jungle warfare for them it was like playing cowboys and
[00:58:52] Indians they'd come back from a patrol and you'd hear them talk how many teeth did you get
[00:58:57] or how many did you kill and they'd brag while I killed three or four now I wanted these patrols
[00:59:06] much earlier than what we're talking about right now I was leading this patrol and had four
[00:59:10] five others with me and we ended up we were in a location where the army had now passed through
[00:59:18] our lines and they were in control so we came right by the reddish metal regimental CP and the
[00:59:27] army colonel says what do you guys doing here said well we got it with constant patrols as
[00:59:31] well we're in charge here now we don't need you any more and so we said so the we moved
[00:59:40] on for a little bit further back to our own line where we were in reserve and it turned out
[00:59:47] we had a little bit higher than we was so he'd look up at us and we were on the skyline from
[00:59:51] his from his perspective very skyline and then we would at peace of well you're going to track
[00:59:56] fire being up there well here's parsley crack but not entirely well anyway as we as we
[01:00:04] left my man says say they're they're two or three snipers in a tree right over there C.P.
[01:00:12] what should we do I said shoot them so we shot them killed them and and told the Colonel
[01:00:18] he just shot three snipers right over here C.P.
[01:00:25] and later on later on I'm and we return in 1982 there's a there's a big Catholic church right
[01:00:32] there now and I talked to the to the not a priest when next went up who's there and I
[01:00:40] tell him about it and then that same later on that same day well he so he he's the one
[01:00:49] as a young as a young priest he's the one that rescued Joel Foss when he got shut down
[01:00:56] I've gotten the water and he's all tangled up in his fairs who've never been out
[01:01:00] to tell him about it well later on that day we saw we saw Joel Foss and then in here he met
[01:01:07] he met this priest you know and he was talking about it and so anyway what's interesting is that
[01:01:17] when they told us this army Colonel what we had just done the Colonel was still unhappy with us
[01:01:24] and and and at the same reunion when we saw Joel Foss and all there was there was a
[01:01:34] veteran army who had previously had been a Marine in China and he joined the National Guard
[01:01:41] and that's where he was out there this time and he came to me he says you know
[01:01:46] I just heard you talking I was there and you had a beard like Santa Claus and it says you were there yeah
[01:01:56] and that says after you left I told the Colonel says you know after all we're on the same side
[01:02:03] a small world yeah that's crazy after all these years you know we talked a little bit about
[01:02:10] about Murdoch and and he's quite the character and you talk about him a little bit here
[01:02:22] because captain what happened to Captain of the block you get somehow somehow Murdoch ends up taking over
[01:02:30] eventually the block was relieved and replaced by Murdoch who's an ideal a Boston Irishman
[01:02:36] Murdoch was very funny and very tough a superb combat a superb combat commander and a bit wild too
[01:02:43] all traits that is younger charges greatly appreciated one manifestation of his toughness apart from his
[01:02:48] courage and coolness under fire was his disdain for metals and combinations very few men who had
[01:02:54] him as their CEO including me received decorations Murdoch explained I didn't recommend many people
[01:03:01] I didn't care if a machine gunner killed 50 men that's what he was supposed to do that's what he's
[01:03:05] getting paid for that was my attitude once in Hawaii we had a big for the formation with the
[01:03:10] division and they decorated all these guys one company would give 40 metals out I'd give one my attitude
[01:03:16] was hey killing japs is our job we're not doing it for metals yeah and here here you start to talk
[01:03:26] about just the whole just the the brutality of what's going on over there one of the themes
[01:03:34] running through the preceding anecdotes is the merciless nature of the Pacific war the Marine
[01:03:39] court had tried to prepare us for this in our training bayonet drills were especially important
[01:03:44] in reality in combat there to be aggressive you see right right yeah in reality in combat there are
[01:03:51] few instances when men used bayonets in the traditional manner fixed to the rifles bayonet drills
[01:03:57] were performed for their psychological effect so that men would learn the psychology of the bayonet
[01:04:03] namely to kill brutally quickly and unthinkingly without compunction or moral qualms so
[01:04:09] done realistic as far as the application right but our training merely paved the way for our
[01:04:15] transformation into hardened killers exposure to actual combat accomplished and completed the
[01:04:23] process you got hard or you died it was that simple killer be a killer be killed you know
[01:04:30] and the Japanese made it simple they were they were notoriously unspearing their reputation
[01:04:37] for ruthlessness and savagery was widespread and well-founded we knew all the stories the rape of
[01:04:43] Nand King the Badan death marks atrocities committed far and wide and often against prisoners
[01:04:49] we believed correctly that we could expect no pity if we fell into their hands they neither
[01:04:54] asked for quarter nor gave any and we responded in kind if they had set rules as we believed
[01:05:00] we were damn sure going to play by them one other choice do we have they simply would not
[01:05:06] surrender they would not stop coming out us until we killed them very quickly we learned that
[01:05:11] trying to take prisoners was a waste of time and dangerous even the wounded if we went to treat them
[01:05:16] would try and kill us by usually by blowing up everyone themselves and the corpsmen who had
[01:05:21] stopped to help them with a grenade the dead had a nasty habit of rising up from the ground
[01:05:26] and attacking us so we made sure the dead were truly dead no sense in taking chances this killer
[01:05:33] be killed approach to war was as brutalizing as it was brutal and affected everyone to some degree
[01:05:39] Murdock recalled a corpsman who came up to me and said hey lieutenant I've got well I've got
[01:05:44] a live one can I shoot him I said sure go ahead corpsman won't want to want to
[01:05:48] expose to have weapons and we shouldn't have shot that wounded guy but I let him do it
[01:05:54] we all we all did it all the time because if we took a prisoner it would take two men at least
[01:05:58] to send him back to the rear and we were so thin our lines were really thin because we had a lot of
[01:06:03] guy's sick our units were very much depleted thus we became inert to the horrors of war and not
[01:06:10] surprisingly we did horrible things not without reason when your enemy behaves in a beastial fashion
[01:06:17] it is only natural to look on them as beasts natural and to some extent justify or they consider
[01:06:24] his animals really but we were not without sin in this regard far from it Murdock for example
[01:06:34] never took any prisoners and here's Murdock I wasn't nice I did bad things looking back over the
[01:06:40] years I can say we probably committed as many atrocities against the dead bodies of the Japanese
[01:06:44] as they did to ours pulling teeth for example goal for example we'd heard japs wanted to die looking
[01:06:53] at the sun so we'd rolled them over and stick their faces in the dirt so we couldn't so they
[01:06:57] couldn't see the sun our guys would cut off fingers and make fobs which believe are not with
[01:07:01] the finger of the japs finger hanging down and they'd go out there with the knives and pliers
[01:07:07] trying to pull out gold teeth but if some of us truly relished but if some of them men truly relished
[01:07:15] battle embraced and enjoyed it enjoyed the killing the brutality the horror all of it it is important
[01:07:21] to establish that on the continuum of brutal human behavior the rest of us were not all that far
[01:07:29] removed from them and we tended to move closer as the war went on some manner more capable than
[01:07:35] others when it comes to killing but all men are capable one way we improved on this capability
[01:07:42] such improvement being vital to our effectiveness as Marines not to mention our very survival
[01:07:48] was to look on our enemy as hateful creatures less than human from a psychological standpoint
[01:07:53] it became easy to kill them we were killing animals not men and after killing them we would look
[01:07:58] upon their dead bodies and feel nothing no remorse no guilt no horror pity or whatever from there
[01:08:05] it was just a small step to place in the geography of the mind we were pulling gold teeth out
[01:08:12] of corpses was not all that outrageous but now many were doing that there's just a few crazy guys
[01:08:18] doing it and one of my one of my sergeants that did that and he had a whole had a whole pocket full
[01:08:24] and for some reason rather something happy changes fans or something and they were all so
[01:08:29] I'll get some more yeah I like the fact that you said basically that I mean somebody asked me
[01:08:37] about dehumanizing the enemy and when we were fighting and I rack and I said the enemy dehumanizes
[01:08:43] themselves with their what their actions that they would take and that's the same situation here
[01:08:49] you know the in Iraq the insurgents would be head people and skin people alive and just do
[01:08:57] absolutely horrible I don't know what the Turks seem to be doing that right now it seems like I don't
[01:09:01] know that's a thing cleansing yeah there's definitely some uh it's hard to figure out what's going on
[01:09:09] over there right now I saw some fresh reports of what going on in the absolute yeah it does not look good you
[01:09:20] also had some people that couldn't that didn't adopt that mentality and here's Murdoch talking
[01:09:23] about it talking about people that couldn't adopt that killer be killed mentality he said they'd
[01:09:30] have to go back because they were no good to us they just disappear they'd be sent back to the
[01:09:35] states it was a self-weeding process the guys who remained were the guys you could depend on
[01:09:40] when I became company commander New Zealand that was an awful thing I had to do we could send
[01:09:45] 3% of our personnel home every so often so they could start new outfits back in the states
[01:09:50] but you never wanted to send the good guys home you send the shitheads and the screwups I wanted
[01:09:55] the best men with me I didn't want any of my good men to go in New Zealand just before we sailed
[01:10:01] for Talawa Tarawa Murdoch told our company now listen I'm gonna send some of you guys home if you
[01:10:07] fuck up you're going to go but he told me later these kids were so good they just wouldn't do that
[01:10:13] they wouldn't fuck up on purpose they would do their job and do it well they didn't want to be
[01:10:18] come known as a fuck up and a lot of those kids were killed on Talawa that I could have sent home
[01:10:24] but that's what happened because I wanted to keep the good guys with me man that's a powerful
[01:10:29] statement all these guys have to do is be slackers and they'll get sent home to the states but they
[01:10:36] wouldn't do it that's the Marine Corps. The thing is this isn't a general average opinion I don't think
[01:10:45] he was a little bit overboard and all this discussion you know he's not difficult in other words
[01:10:52] but he was he was well-liked because of because of when he looked at life
[01:10:58] yeah he talks about one guy here he says I had one guy a platoon a lieutenant platoon leader will call him
[01:11:04] Mac. Yeah not as real names. That's the one I took over from and then where I almost got killed.
[01:11:10] He says he was a Yale graduate came from Connecticut very well brought up had money nice guy too
[01:11:15] and handsome a rugged look good looking Marine but on Guadalcanal he'd go on patrol he just could not handle it
[01:11:21] while he'd go bean yes was his platoon sergeant and he'd have to take over Mac's patrols all the time
[01:11:26] Mac tried but he couldn't do it I respected him for that he was trying the kids were calling him yellow
[01:11:32] and they'd say to me we don't want that guy he's yellow and I'd say wait just a minute that guy is not
[01:11:37] yellow he tried to do the job but he's just not he couldn't just couldn't do it just going to
[01:11:42] a yellow man doesn't go out and try he quits Mac won't go this go deenia see became an officer
[01:11:48] he married an anus elin gal I knew him pretty well all right so continuing on here by December
[01:11:59] our long so during the front line of taking a big toll we were wasted by illness multiple illnesses
[01:12:04] we were malnourished and looked it we went about shirtless showing squannie bodies with protruding ribs
[01:12:09] and vertebrae and salose skin stretched over stretched hotly over them our faces were drawn
[01:12:14] in angular beneath scraggly beards and our eyes were recessed in their orbits we didn't have a
[01:12:19] change of clothes during that period and we became unimaginably filthy we looked scary and
[01:12:24] menacing and pitiful a lot of us came down with yellow jannus see that that would do a
[01:12:28] liberate that would do you and too you know the constant threat of enemy attack punctuated by
[01:12:36] intermittent balance of actual fighting was tremendously stressful it seemed that much of the time
[01:12:41] we were either waiting to be attacked or being attacked or attacking the enemy ourselves or we were
[01:12:46] just sitting around trying to get some rest but feeling cruddy because we were sick and we always
[01:12:50] were tensed up thinking and worrying about our next combat action depending on how your day was going
[01:12:55] such concerns might be in the forefront of your thoughts incessant and acute making you all
[01:12:59] edgy and fretful or they might be buried deep usually they were somewhere in between but they were
[01:13:05] always present in your head and on your mind you could never fully let go or get rid of them
[01:13:09] the unrelenting mental strain not to do not not to mention the physical dangers that caused it
[01:13:15] made us twitch your each passing day you know during the during the times that we were
[01:13:22] we were back behind the front lines and nobody's shooting at you home like I said it's wonderful
[01:13:29] nobody's shooting at me and all that stress you know now you now you don't have to worry about it
[01:13:37] now what about the fact that even though no one's shooting at you right now you have time to
[01:13:42] sit there and think about the fact that you're going to go again and the enemy's going to attack you
[01:13:47] and you know somebody pull up pull it what it was stupid thing so it's through a hand grenade
[01:13:52] dummy into a tent everybody just took off why would a guy do that I don't understand he thought it was funny
[01:13:59] I'll tell you why I'm laughing when you tell that story because one of my friends what
[01:14:06] am I good friends a guy by the name of Lave Babin who I work with and wrote a book with
[01:14:12] wrote two books with him actually he did that two a couple of his guys took a
[01:14:17] took a grenade and we were in Ramadi and he took a grenade the pin was in it was still taped up
[01:14:22] but it was real grenade and there was a couple of guys sitting in a room talking and he just opened
[01:14:26] the door and rolled the grenade in there we were just talking about the other day yeah oh yeah
[01:14:31] we were just talking about the reason I remember we were just talking about yesterday and he goes
[01:14:35] yeah that wasn't smart it wasn't smart because who knows what's going to happen I mean those guys
[01:14:39] it with they had guns they might have shot I mean there's all kinds of crazy things that couldn't happen
[01:14:43] you make it mean later on yet in here but also in our last drive on Guadalconelle I had
[01:14:50] an enemy grenade filled right there by my legs and I tried to kick it away and hit something came
[01:14:56] right on back it was a dud. Here's Murdoch talking about Guadalconelle and why what made it
[01:15:13] what made it Guadalconelle he said each campaign was different each with different problems
[01:15:18] Tar was the worst in terms of fighting but the battle lasted only three days right after it
[01:15:23] we right after it ended we were taken off Baycheo and sent back to Hawaii but on Guadalconelle
[01:15:28] we were on Guadalconelle for three months. For the amount of time we were there we didn't do
[01:15:32] all that much fighting but there were other things the sickness and the heat especially the
[01:15:37] living conditions were the worst on Guadalconelle and then you say as bad as it was it was worse
[01:15:42] for the Japanese much worse their condition was no mystery for us as December gave way to January
[01:15:47] there was a noticeable drop off an enemy activity that we correctly ascribed to their deteriorating
[01:15:53] health their nocturnal probes dwindled and in time virtually ceased altogether they simply
[01:15:59] lacked the energy to come out us in the night. We didn't know they didn't even bother to yell at us
[01:16:12] they rarely achieved success when they did attack in battle we found we had as we been told on
[01:16:17] Simoa the Japanese made the same mistakes over and over for instance they would commit their units
[01:16:22] to battle as they became available instead of holding them back and massing them for a single
[01:16:26] powerful blow and they would keep coming in small coming out of until they were killed primarily
[01:16:31] by our artillery the carnage was sickening even to us weak and we couldn't understand why they
[01:16:36] never seemed to learn from their experiences and make the necessary adjustments. One one thing
[01:16:41] that was wrong with their strategy that they they had attacked and there was no command to change
[01:16:48] are you going to go out of flying or something like that to just keep coming and keep coming
[01:16:51] to other all kill. Yeah that's a lack of leadership and maneuver warfare right that's not
[01:16:58] no maneuver no maneuver at all no maneuver just hey we're going forward we're going to do a
[01:17:01] a frontal assault and they would just get killed to get mode down and that happened time and
[01:17:06] time again. Here we are coming in the terror law the same situation we had no no way to maneuver
[01:17:13] anything and just keep going into facing heavy machine gun fire just like the Japanese did.
[01:17:20] The Japanese thought their indelvinable will would provide them with a margin for victory it did
[01:17:25] not occur to them or they could not acknowledge that the Marines and soldiers they were battling
[01:17:30] were equally indelvinable and in the end victorious. They had so easy on moving all down through the
[01:17:38] the east end is not that and it's just everything just just faded away and they just kept going
[01:17:45] no problem at all. And then they met American forces. So then so this is this is a turning point
[01:17:53] of going to go out and where they that's where they return the tables now where now we're in the offensive. Yeah
[01:17:59] do so January 10th you begin going on off. Eighth Marines the one eight the two eight and the
[01:18:07] three eight I worked with the three eight a bunch of your body they were outstanding. Yeah our mission orders
[01:18:13] issued by General Patch were to attack and destroy the Japanese format forces remaining on Guadalcanal.
[01:18:19] Yeah. We moved up and I'm just reading and I always have to mention this I'm obviously not reading
[01:18:29] this whole book. I could read this whole book. I want to read this whole book because the book is
[01:18:35] outstanding but I'm jumping around so if it seems a little bit scattered it's because I'm jumping
[01:18:39] from I'm skipping over big chunks that you're telling with great detail and and this is this is one
[01:18:45] of the most outstanding accounts that exists of these campaigns. So just know that you have to buy
[01:18:52] the book the book is called Faith for Warriors. So here we go we moved we pushed on we moved up
[01:18:59] and over hill 82 the hill and jungle draws below were in festo with Japanese my men saw a
[01:19:03] single Japanese soldier and open fire killing him instantly I collected some personal effects from
[01:19:08] his body a diary a lock of hair a first aid kit a photograph of a group of soldiers and a
[01:19:14] thousand stitch belt which is a piece of cloth embroidered with a thousand stitches by wellwishers
[01:19:20] that he carried for good luck. No I sent a lot of this stuff that we took off of the dead home
[01:19:25] to Japan to their to their families eventually. Eventually and we'll probably get into a bit but
[01:19:31] the I received a letter from the brother one of these soldiers just beautifully done calligraphy
[01:19:36] you know. Yeah so you you held on to this stuff and eventually figured out who this got
[01:19:43] did that because we we were asked to talk to a Japanese in Los Angeles and there's a Japanese
[01:19:50] Japanese area there and the the the priest there suggested I do that he couldn't speak any
[01:19:59] English but through the translation I knew that that's what had to do and so we sent it
[01:20:05] to the to the relatives of Philadelphia worked with at North American Aviation and
[01:20:11] his wife's family were Honda which is a Honda car and so we sent her to one of her cousins
[01:20:20] and when they they came to Fay baseball in this country after the war and they lost so they
[01:20:27] had lost face to so to speak so they wanted to go back with something so they took this all
[01:20:33] of these items that I'd taken off of these soldiers that we're talking about here and they put it
[01:20:38] in a white box strong around their neck as they got as they landed in Hawaii a lot of
[01:20:45] Buddhist priests were there with me to play when they got to Tokyo all a big thing always picked up
[01:20:52] and my name got all over all over Japan about over that incredible. What were you thinking about
[01:21:02] at the time I mean at the time you couldn't have been thinking about that all that was going
[01:21:06] to happen. You know and also you know where we we were asked to attend this Buddhist ceremony
[01:21:14] and my family had made three daughters with me and here we're the first ones in line and you're
[01:21:19] we're supposed to you're supposed to you had to carry these incense and there's a gong and
[01:21:25] goes on and well bunch of stuff we we led that procession as it went by then after that we we had a
[01:21:33] get together sokiyaki and and beer in the in the percentage yeah and I'd be real careful
[01:21:41] what I said you know I had my friend as a translator be real careful they didn't call them
[01:21:46] japs and all that yeah and I said how come come there's so interesting what happened here
[01:21:52] as well these these people from northern part of Japan and they had no clue of what had
[01:21:57] happened to their soldiers way down south yeah because they didn't have enough weightness is
[01:22:07] living after the war you know to explain and then on on site pan and I was talking to Donny
[01:22:13] Edwards we were there at you been there you know where this what this call suicide clip
[01:22:18] well there there's one monument there and there were paid for by children raising the money
[01:22:24] and one of them faces south kneeling a mother mourning over her lost her sons lost in the
[01:22:32] south city the other was facing the suicide cliff mourning the children that were carried over
[01:22:38] the cliff to be killed and what is happening was they were just putting in the new monument
[01:22:46] they hadn't don't have the new captions yet and I was explaining to Donny what that what that
[01:22:50] was all about and it's on it's it's on uh uh uh Instagram go to Instagram and you go to best
[01:22:59] defense foundation and they'll tell about it okay yeah so even though you're gathering souvenirs this
[01:23:08] is not over yet and here you go the fighting was constant but not everywhere at the same time one squad
[01:23:13] might be resting wall nearby another was engaged with a sharp fight yeah it's true with a sniper
[01:23:19] machine gunness and all up and down the line automatic weapons rattled rifles crack grenades
[01:23:24] popped the air carry this the stringent smell of cordite in places where there had been a lot of
[01:23:30] firing the atmosphere was hazy with gunsmoke and the smoke of burning foliage there was a lot of
[01:23:34] shouting someone screaming the and the frequent cry corpsman corpsman stretcher down this is not
[01:23:40] a general atmosphere this this is a certain locations this is happening because not here where you say
[01:23:45] yeah because then this is because the Japanese were really depleted at this point pretty much so yeah they
[01:23:49] will yeah uh stretcher bearers many of them musicians in the divisions band yeah right ran around
[01:23:56] the battlefield picking up the wounded and carrying them back the battalion aid station so every
[01:24:02] Marines arrive amen as well as there's the band out there there's the pressure pressure bearers
[01:24:09] yeah 14 January we continue to advance the action much the same as the day before
[01:24:16] intermittent class with Japanese diehard some of the Japanese we came upon
[01:24:20] blew themselves up and their holes were just sat there and let us kill them with the grenades
[01:24:24] yeah my puttune made good progress you got a guy named the blowing sounds up a little hand
[01:24:31] grenade right here put he had it and kick it off and his team blown south up right over here
[01:24:36] so with they trying to take Marines with him not well yeah as they could but when you get
[01:24:43] in a side panel explain there how would we we saw a hundred over a hundred doing that as we
[01:24:47] advance and they could have shot back as they didn't instead they just we got so close
[01:24:53] and they blown themselves bang bang bang as we as we as we had passed incredible
[01:25:00] uh one guy you lost a guy named Gunner Lund and you with a gunner Lund had kind of a
[01:25:11] had a kid that looked up to him made her shall wheelcy and you and he wrote he's a
[01:25:16] one that did some of these illustrations okay and in this one here okay so wheel ski you're
[01:25:22] the one that has to tell wheel ski that you know his his he is no more he's no more and here we
[01:25:28] are shortly thereafter it fell upon me to break the news of Lund's death to corporal hercial
[01:25:33] wheel ski ski as he was known was a bar man and a squad leader in Lund's puttune yeah
[01:25:39] he took Lund's death very hard gunner Lund was a popular figure and B company an old salt
[01:25:44] who was trusted and respected for his courage competence and common sense battle wisdom
[01:25:49] and loved for his tough his rough humor and for the obvious and genuine affection
[01:25:53] and concerned he felt for his young charges before the war he had been sea going marine
[01:25:58] serving on the beloved aircraft the Lexington he'd always been smoking a cigar how
[01:26:03] we was able to keep himself stock with stowies on guano canals anyone's guess such
[01:26:07] of the talents of an old salt he used to say that after the war he was going to buy himself a
[01:26:11] big shiny cattle act convertible and ride around smoking his cigars instead of that high
[01:26:16] visit his family after the war he had a sister that had been to a dance and they couldn't
[01:26:22] find her anywhere she was dead in the trunk they found her body in the trunk of the car
[01:26:29] been murdered and they got this this same time as hit as when he the family found out about Lund
[01:26:35] oh yeah you said that that was a simple dream for a simple very good man a dream never realized
[01:26:46] all the kids looked up to Lund wheel skiing particular ski idolized Lund the gunner was everything
[01:26:50] to him a hero mentor father figure older brother and best friend at first he refused to
[01:26:55] believe that Lund had been killed yeah i was just talking to him a few minutes ago he said
[01:26:59] but then the truth said again and he became distraught and threw his weapon on the ground this
[01:27:04] damn war he exclaimed yeah ski then announced he was quitting the marine core and quitting the war
[01:27:10] he meant what he said he was about to head back to the rear when Murdoch arrived on the scene
[01:27:14] Murdoch's calm ski down and told him that he just couldn't up and quit that it would be
[01:27:19] desertion in the face of the enemy and that he would get a lot of trouble for it Murdoch spoke
[01:27:23] softly with him for several minutes in this vein until ski came to a senses ski picked up as
[01:27:29] weapon and rejoined third platoon and Murdoch assumed command of that unit but ski was a changed man
[01:27:35] exchanging one man as for another he went from being a marine who did his job and did it well
[01:27:40] to being a marine who did his job with a singular passion from that day forward he hated the
[01:27:45] Japanese with a savage intensity and took it on himself to personally avenge Lund's death
[01:27:51] often going off by himself to hunt the enemy if you were a compassionate man you might say a
[01:27:55] prayer for any Japanese soldiers who crossed his path he always returned eventually but with
[01:28:02] little to say about his exploits he was the quiet type guys like him usually are yeah
[01:28:09] he's the impediment he pedamy of a combat marine and so this continues on and then you say this
[01:28:20] and so to the end my memory of the final days of January offensive is blurry and I find it
[01:28:24] difficult to remember the details that reunions we reminisce about our very limited personnel
[01:28:29] personal perspective of the offense and the countless little battles that were fought as we went
[01:28:34] forward at that perilous time we focused primarily on our own concerns about adequate cover for
[01:28:41] incoming artillery and other life threatening events in our immediate area we advanced on a broad
[01:28:46] front but never in an even line some units always move faster than others depending on the terrain
[01:28:51] and the resistance they encountered we went up and down more hills and ridges up and down up and down
[01:28:56] sometimes fighting and killing the Japanese sometimes just killing them and to January or last week
[01:29:02] on guadal canal be company was bivalact by Henderson Field awaiting transport off the island while
[01:29:07] there I came down with jaundice and I lost a lot of weight I would be getting off the island just
[01:29:12] in time in the meantime there were no duties to perform some of them very on there's on the
[01:29:18] in the meantime there were still duties to perform in some of them very unpleasant one of Murdoch's
[01:29:22] responsibility was to record the location of the battle site graves on an overlay it troubled him
[01:29:27] that the locations couldn't always be specifically pin-boinered so there was no so there could be no assurance
[01:29:32] that the bodies would later be found for relocation to permanent cemetery now regarding those bodies
[01:29:38] year or so go the organization that at locate bodies and get some buried all there and
[01:29:46] they're in hoi and on lilloo and they ran out of money but they were going to pay for me go down
[01:29:53] and help them locate these bodies we're talking about but the guy that he was he was a doctorate
[01:30:01] and he says I just I just ran out of legal room money wise couldn't do it
[01:30:10] so finally this is last year wow yeah well maybe we can raise some money for him
[01:30:20] this was a call cheap back and then it's now a new name they probably might say they were missed missed
[01:30:25] they were missed missed they were missed handling money there's many money where they shouldn't have
[01:30:31] been so a lot of those going on you probably heard about and then the new secretary fan came
[01:30:37] down he did he just changed the whole thing around so we wrapped this up the section on January
[01:30:49] on 31 January the one eight and the entire second regiment boarded the troop transport crescent city
[01:30:55] and then during the first week of February the Japanese managed to evacuate more than 11,000 troops
[01:31:00] a minor triumph that did little to offset the magnets you do there to feet they lost upward of 25,000 men
[01:31:07] in Guadalcanal campaign of these maybe a thousand were taken prisoner our losses were comparatively small
[01:31:13] according to army historians about 1600 were killed and 4,245 were wounded on nine February the
[01:31:21] rest of the eighth Marines left Guadalcanal on board the troop ship hunter ligate at American
[01:31:26] Legion that same day Guadalcanal was declared secure one way or another for the living and the dead
[01:31:35] the fighting on Guadalcanal was over forever
[01:31:37] so your next chapter here is called heaven yeah because from the hell of Guadalcanal you went to
[01:31:54] a place called New Zealand and this was quite the change for you all going from Guadalcanal
[01:32:01] to New Zealand no longer sweating jungles you you highlight some of the good things about
[01:32:09] New Zealand and then then you get to what apparently is the biggest highlight in New Zealand
[01:32:14] it says this there were girls holy smokes whether they're all gone but they were
[01:32:20] they were welcome here so for no because they're men were overfighting because they were
[01:32:25] in North Africa young girls pretty girls smiling girls they were everywhere lots of them
[01:32:31] my girl my girlfriend was 19 and not here I was I was approaching 23 he 22 she's still alive she's
[01:32:38] 95 no wow can you imagine they stared at us and we stared at them and they smiled at us
[01:32:45] and we smiled at them and in many instances we greeted each other and exchange pleasantries
[01:32:50] and actually conversed with them even the castanovas among us had a hard gov at at first
[01:32:56] it had been a long time since we had spoken with girls we were out of practice we were also
[01:33:00] gasey is the term you use staring inward a thousand yards back into our heads flashing on our
[01:33:05] thoughts and visions of Guadalcanal put in there our faces and what do you have for that
[01:33:13] just be just yeah just remembering yeah
[01:33:15] the contrast was immediately apparent profoundly jarring we had learned how to handle hell
[01:33:22] but heaven would take some getting used to a board ship we we hadn't been aware of our gasey
[01:33:27] conditioned we all seem normal to each other but here in this beautiful city among these wonderful
[01:33:33] civilized people among all those pretty girls it was possible to see how far from normal we were
[01:33:38] what would they think of us they loved us and we loved them right back so you guys I mean you
[01:33:48] do talk about some of the things that happened there and some of those adjustments getting into it
[01:33:53] and and then the kind of I guess the kind of mayhem and chaos that you were more dark himself
[01:33:59] he there's one story about where where he come barging barging into the owner the woman owner
[01:34:06] the hotel where our her officers mess where the get together was and it tells about it in there
[01:34:15] yeah anyway he comes he called he crawled he was drunk no clothes on I guess and crawled along an
[01:34:23] edge and then wrapped on the window and she opened it up that I mean he ended up going then next morning
[01:34:29] woke up here's with us older woman and oh my gosh yes she says something like you know good
[01:34:38] morning he says did I have a good time or something like that but she said yes you did
[01:34:44] sounded like he she he was avoiding her for the rest of the time yeah yeah you
[01:34:51] all right to get back to the military side of this after a few weeks new Zealand we started
[01:34:57] training in earnest we we needed a lot of training both to get ourselves back into shape and incorporate
[01:35:02] replacements who are streaming in from the states our experience on Guadalcanal provided the template
[01:35:07] for our training we built positions on the Japanese model and practiced attacking them we advanced
[01:35:13] through wooded areas against simulated sniper attacks we worked on the use of supporting fires
[01:35:17] and we worked with tanks one of the most important changes overall was to give the squad leaders
[01:35:23] more freedom of action to make decisions in combat let them decide on their own how to maneuver
[01:35:28] their men and move around to develop and any members I'm sure there's no room for maneuver
[01:35:37] no no no chance to use tanks but it's interesting you know we we talk a lot about
[01:35:44] kind of the principles of combat leadership and one of the most important principles of combat
[01:35:47] leadership is decentralized command and that is allowing your support and leaders to lead and that
[01:35:52] right there even the private say even a private say come on guys this going he pull them together
[01:35:57] let's go yeah and and you that's obviously you're taking that lesson that's it then you say
[01:36:02] that's a change overall yeah you guys even you all realized hey we need our frontline troops to
[01:36:07] be able to lead yeah yeah I mentioned that when I I spoken to Marine Corps League you know
[01:36:13] the Marine Corps birthday balls know that and I mentioned that leadership aspect
[01:36:18] you're written books about two I know I have it's one of the things I talk about all the time
[01:36:23] oh yeah and when I taught leadership inside the steel teams that's one of the main things I
[01:36:27] needed the young troopers to do who you would have been a disaster that had happened yeah
[01:36:35] so fast forward a bit through the you talk some more about that training and what it's like
[01:36:40] in New Zealand and the continues on and then finally we get to this I'm not going to say that
[01:36:45] we knew we were leaving for good but many sense this might be the case so did everyone in Wellington
[01:36:50] the girls especially just before our ships cast off again for Hawks Bay a number of girls some
[01:36:55] hugely pregnant came down to the docks to find out what was going on nobody could or would tell them anything
[01:37:02] but many had dire for it nobody knew you guys didn't even know we did had no no never clue
[01:37:07] without we're going another another another land here exercise our ship steam north past Hawks Bay
[01:37:13] continued on a northern league yet after a few days it's he was announced that we were going to
[01:37:17] invade the Taroa toll in the Gilbert Islands maps and sand tables were brought it out one square mile
[01:37:24] one square mile our sudden permanent disappearance from New Zealand was very hard on our Kiwi
[01:37:31] girlfriends and wives one day they woke up to find us gone a new year head into battle
[01:37:37] then towards the end of November they started hearing rumors that a lot of us had been killed
[01:37:43] the rumors proved to be true yeah we lost over eleven hundred killed and twenty five hundred
[01:37:53] wounded in three days most of them two days so you get to Taroa and here we are the navy promised
[01:38:03] us a preliminary build bombardment that would blow the Japanese and their defenses to kingdom come
[01:38:08] leaving the Marines to carry out what would amount to little more than a mopping up operation
[01:38:13] during a pre invasion staff briefing an admiral announced that it was not the navy's intention
[01:38:19] merely to neutralize ratio island gentlemen he told me assemblage we will obliterate it
[01:38:26] this statement was passed on to rank and file and we believed it at the same briefing a battle ship
[01:38:31] captain declared we are going to bombard at six thousand yards we've got so much armor
[01:38:36] we're not afraid of anything the japs control back at us the commander of the second marine
[01:38:41] division major general julian c-smith was in sense to buy the captains brave words gentlemen
[01:38:46] he retorted remember one thing when the Marines land and meet the enemy at bay net point
[01:38:51] the only armor a marine will have is his khaki shirt it is unbelievable though when you see
[01:38:58] the bombardment you can see film of the bombardment at Taroa i mean they just look like it was just
[01:39:02] obliterators right and i had i had a situation where my guys in the battle of ramaati
[01:39:12] got caught in a friendly fire situation and you were there ramaati yep and uh an army unit that
[01:39:20] we had called for qrf came in and put about 150 rounds of 50 caliber machine gun fire into the building
[01:39:28] that my guys were in at a range of about 25 meters 150 rounds and you you would think anybody
[01:39:36] that's seen a 50 caliber machine gun you'd think everyone in that building would be dead but
[01:39:41] what i'd one guy get wounded it wasn't actually all that bad and so when you see the the that's
[01:39:48] why you can never trust that you know big bombs are going to actually solve the problem it doesn't
[01:39:54] always happen and this is a classic example of that and the main reason that naval gun fire
[01:39:59] wasn't wasn't all that effective is that we're just only you know the land was only about six
[01:40:04] foot above sea level so things you must have just gone over if you hit there it's just such a narrow
[01:40:11] target and they what you should have done is landed on a adjacent island and pounded it with
[01:40:19] what the way mortars are you know a sharp rain artillery safe fire and that's what they did and that's
[01:40:24] what they did in the marshals they made all difference their world less and learn to no much later
[01:40:29] so you say this it's tough going right from the start the Japanese are heavily armed firmly and deeply
[01:40:33] entrenched and as always they've resist fiercely infecting heavy uh inflicting heavy casualties
[01:40:38] on our assault teams the radio reports start coming in their spotty and intermittent but we get the
[01:40:43] picture encountering heavy resistance heavy machine gun fire boats destroyed units scattered
[01:40:48] many casualties the voices on the loudspeakers are numerate these calamities and measured tones
[01:40:53] they sound calm almost attached if you if you didn't know better you'd think the situation wasn't too
[01:40:59] terrible but we knew better we were all looking at each other thinking some version of oh boy this is bad
[01:41:05] this is really bad the tides the tides which were supposed to cover the reef to an adequate depth
[01:41:13] proved uncooperative the waters too shallow just inches and just inches deep in some spots
[01:41:18] and always less than needed for the three foot draft of the landing craft see the problem
[01:41:23] was that there was just barely three feet what we require for now CBP to clear the reef
[01:41:30] but we got hung up with their big guns their their big naval guns shooting under
[01:41:35] transports so our transports had to move further out that means the all landing craft took a
[01:41:40] lot longer to get in and the meantime the tide was going out now we didn't have three feet
[01:41:47] not only that it was the kind of a tide that was extra low so you you were actually
[01:41:54] part of the reserve element is that is that the right we were going what you were doing the one
[01:41:59] out the the battalion on him was going to was supposed to land on the next island up
[01:42:03] instead hey oh we need to write down here in real and unright the middle where the worst of
[01:42:10] it was so here here we had our guys on the beach and here here the enemy should know where
[01:42:16] they're head right at us out there we could do anything but yeah terrible so just for folks
[01:42:25] they don't understand what you just said you've got marines on the beach on the beach looking at us
[01:42:31] Washington's being mowed down and you're at sea and we can't shoot back you can't shoot because
[01:42:35] now there's friendly forces in between you two just and like you said the sea level is only
[01:42:40] are the altitude only six feet and not only that there was one beach to have a British transport
[01:42:48] and it was beach it it had been run before we landed there sometime before about time before
[01:42:53] our work and run up like on on the reef and just was still there while the Japanese swam up to it
[01:43:00] with the machine guns they fired flying in fire right on us so all this is happening and you
[01:43:08] run the reserves and finally you guys are told all right load your boats which means you guys
[01:43:13] now know you're going in and you say here we don't know whether the brass is setting us yet but we
[01:43:17] don't expect to go where the fighting is hottest and we expect to go soon we circle and circle
[01:43:23] in the lagoon we're standing in the boat either leaning against the sides or holding on them
[01:43:27] for balance in general we have a soft ride because the water is mostly still except for the
[01:43:31] turbulence caused by all the boats the turbulence buffets the LCVPs and this movement combined
[01:43:37] with the stench of the engine and the nervous tension we all feel makes many of a sick some of the sick
[01:43:43] men some of the sick men stick their heads over the sides to stretch while there's puke into the
[01:43:48] wooden deck the men standing next to them just step aside like it's no big deal to get sick
[01:43:53] because it really isn't a big deal when the men when the sick men finish wretched they straighten
[01:43:57] up as if nothing had happened no one thinks the worst of them for it after a while depending on how
[01:44:03] long we're out there in the boat the deck might be slippery with puke but that's no big deal either
[01:44:07] you can't smell the vomit or anything else for that matter because the exhaust fumes overpower
[01:44:12] every other smell diesel engine help the minutes go by lengthening into hours the hours go by
[01:44:19] but we're going nowhere we're just going around and around the sounds of battle are muted this far out
[01:44:25] we can hear artillery explosions but not small arms fire we're all peering over the sides looking
[01:44:30] abysio looking at the fires and the smoke and the explosions it's an awesome sight a massive smoke and
[01:44:35] flames holy Moses look at that we say not for the last time we ask ourselves how many of the
[01:44:41] defenders how the defenders could survive in a place so torn up it's an irrelevant question really
[01:44:46] many Japanese have survived and they're killing them but have them survived we know that a lot of
[01:44:54] our men were killed going in and we know that the men who did make it a sure are fighting for their
[01:45:00] lives we expect we'll have a tough go of it to wear apprehensive who wouldn't be and we're wondering
[01:45:05] how we'll behave in combat I know the new guys are especially concerned with how they'll behave
[01:45:10] the great fear the greatest of fear is you won't be able to handle it that you'll turn yellow
[01:45:16] that you'll let your buddies down we fear this much more than we fear getting killed or wounded
[01:45:21] one reason for that is no one really thinks he'll be killed or wounded you never think it's going
[01:45:25] to happen to you never you acknowledge that it could happen to you that it might happen to you
[01:45:31] but the rational part of your brain makes you understand this but in the such circumstances we now
[01:45:36] find ourselves emotion trumps rationality every time we know we're too young to die and somehow
[01:45:42] in a kind of strange and protective twist of logic and feeling we figure that because we're too
[01:45:47] young to die we certainly won't die you've got to do a lot of hard thinking to reach this conclusion
[01:45:53] however and because we're all thinking so hard we're not talking that much just as well
[01:45:58] the engine is so loud you can't talk or hear anyone except the guy standing next to you
[01:46:03] we wait for the word to begin the assault but it doesn't come we continue circling beneath the
[01:46:07] hot sun beneath breathing exhaust fumes staring at the island we want we want to know what for
[01:46:14] Pete's sake is happening we wonder what they're when they're going to send us in and where
[01:46:19] they're going to send us we wonder gosh how much longer can it go all like this a lot longer it
[01:46:24] turns out nightfall one moment in the sun one moment the sun is above the horizon and their sky is
[01:46:31] bright then the sun drops below the horizon in the dark that's how night comes in the
[01:46:35] tropics no twilight this is on the on-hequator you see yeah boom it's gone yeah it's bright one moment
[01:46:41] dark the next beijo isn't dark however beijo is on fire and the sky above it glowing red suddenly
[01:46:48] it's morning see the problem is that the top command thought we'd already landed and really there was
[01:46:55] just a lack there was all communications were disrupted so you guys are out there for so they didn't
[01:47:01] know we're out there still circling didn't know it how much fuel does things have because you're
[01:47:06] out there for twenty hours oh twenty hours yeah amazing not horrible yeah that's usually
[01:47:15] Sunday it's morning the sun pops over the horizon and then there was light we're still
[01:47:18] circling waiting for orders base you always still burning I was wondering how our boat can carry
[01:47:22] enough fuel to circle how long is it 12 14 16 hours answer we float we were float for about 20 hours
[01:47:29] our mouths dry our muscle stiff we feel haggard and cruddy some guys are sipping from their
[01:47:34] cantines or nibbling on the rations although there's not much eating because we just aren't hungry
[01:47:40] about five zero five thirty the LCVBA LCVP carrying our batai commander major major
[01:47:46] warranties chugs along up next to our boat cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting to
[01:47:51] make himself heard above the noise of the boat engines he says we're going in at red beach too oh no
[01:47:57] and what what why was that why was that a bad thing we knew that that probably
[01:48:01] some way we knew that that was where they haven't heard this time was on that beach
[01:48:07] still shouting major haze assures us that red too won't be a problem the Japanese positions
[01:48:13] on the beach have been eliminated he tells us and our landing will be unopposed you'll probably
[01:48:18] go in standing up he actually said that so you said in the book he actually said I guess we were
[01:48:23] completely surprised thinking back we were none of us really believed we'd go in standing up now
[01:48:30] not that we think meet major haze is feeding us a line he's a good man he wouldn't do that
[01:48:35] but it could be that he has been misinformed uninformed is more likely more like it totally
[01:48:41] uninformed communications with the units ashore or deseray and several instances functionally
[01:48:47] not existed the same goes for communications with general smith and his staff on the battle
[01:48:51] ship Maryland the invasions fleet flagship this is doing large but charged measure to failure
[01:48:57] of our radios which are too fragile to withstand the rigors of amphibious assault
[01:49:02] I've got a walking talking strapped over my shoulder and it's a hunk of joke hunk of junk
[01:49:07] I can't even communicate with the other boats which is why major haze had to come by in
[01:49:12] but that's true what was that what was the fucking dog is what we're doing any good now the
[01:49:17] officer in charge a red two at that time was Colonel Schupe the 10 of Colonel Schupe he became the
[01:49:24] combatant later on years later in any event we're relieved the waiting is almost over the business
[01:49:31] of riding around in boats is for the birds we want to get ashore and throw some punches I'm
[01:49:36] standing in the battle of our LCVP behind me are 32 marines of my pertune most of them teenagers
[01:49:41] most of them new to combat I look at them and they look at me I see fresh boyace facias
[01:49:46] and wide-wired eyes staring out from beneath their brain their helmet brims their helmets
[01:49:54] all seem a size too big accentuating their boyish making them look young as well most of them
[01:50:00] really are their helmets jammed down on their heads the straps pulled tight under their chin you
[01:50:06] can wear helmets this way so they don't fall off while you're clamoring down the cargo nets of
[01:50:10] the troop transport into your boat the helmet is nothing more than a steel pot heavy and getting
[01:50:14] heavier the longer you wear it if it falls off all you're on that net it could hit somebody beneath
[01:50:18] you somebody could get hurt and that's when and that's not when marines are supposed to get hurt
[01:50:23] not during the boating phase as it's called the phase of the operation when the emphasis is on
[01:50:28] safety the getting hurt part the part where safety is one might say beside the point comes later
[01:50:34] for us for me in the men in my boat that part comes now
[01:50:38] did I say men well I suppose they are we call them men we treat them as men we expect them to act
[01:50:46] like men they are after all united states marines but really their kids just out of high school
[01:50:53] or not even that kids with rifles true kids trained to kill also true but kids never the last
[01:50:58] just turn 17 many of them to use a term like that as long since fallen into general disuse their
[01:51:07] youths a state of being between childhood and adulthood today's american mail at exercising
[01:51:14] a lifestyle choice can often can and often does loiter for many years in that state but in the
[01:51:19] mid-1940s in a world at war the state of youth tends to pass swiftly and do any disayet violently
[01:51:28] the youth the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be
[01:51:33] doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period
[01:51:40] far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience
[01:51:47] these are the men that went in and I have a WRK written on all the casualties in this picture
[01:51:56] and roughly half half her casualties going in
[01:52:08] in that period
[01:52:12] the youths the kids on my boat have got a lot of growing up to do unfortunately they'll be
[01:52:17] doing a hefty portion of that growing up in the coming minutes and hours in that period many
[01:52:22] far too many will undergrow all the growing up they will ever experience they will transition
[01:52:28] with almost obscene dispatch from youth to adulthood to the grave
[01:52:34] a beggio youth won't be served it will be served up and consumed literally in fire these youths will be
[01:52:41] men only briefly and then they will be just a memory forever all of this sounds as if i'm a
[01:52:50] grizzled veteran i am a combat veteran i fought in Guadalcanal earlier this year but the fact is i'm
[01:52:56] just 23 years old still young and not all that grizzled in appearance or temperament practically
[01:53:01] speaking though i'm the graveyard of this bunch same goes for the platoon sergeant who's about my age
[01:53:08] where the tribal elders the warrior chiefs i'll lead my boys off the boat and the platoon sergeant
[01:53:13] standing in the back will make sure they follow urging them and conjolling them yelling at them
[01:53:19] maybe throwing a few choice cuss words whatever it takes to get them moving i'm watching my
[01:53:24] boys as they watch me things begin to happen fast with the majors lzvp leading the way our boats
[01:53:31] break formation one after the other and file off to our departure line this is an invisible line
[01:53:39] about 6,000 yards offshore that runs parallel to the landing beaches when we get there our boats are
[01:53:44] form up all the inline abreast arrayed like a cavalry squadron waiting for the bugle to sound
[01:53:50] charge the coxons rev and gun the engines in neutral gear and the boats are rearing and
[01:53:54] lurching trump charting at the bit it's as if the coxons are struggling to rain in war horses
[01:54:00] that can't contain their eagerness for battle our boats engine is blasting the noise almost painful
[01:54:05] to the years we're pumped up my men i and i i we're really pumped up the adrenaline is flowing
[01:54:11] surging through us clutching our weapons looking over the side of the boat at the island breathing
[01:54:15] hard thinking fast focused on the tastered hand stealing ourselves getting ready ready ready
[01:54:22] here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes us all over the light brigade
[01:54:28] but thinking right there yes yes and repeating repeating verbs as well you see
[01:54:37] oh i'm ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready yeah ready yeah
[01:54:43] little literary yeah little little literary so that's that's that's that's the thank you behind
[01:54:48] tip of the hat yeah here we go the signal is given our coxons shifts out of neutral pushes the throttle
[01:54:55] wide open the engine bellows betch's belch's smoke the stern dips the men in the boat rock
[01:55:00] back slightly as the boat leaps forward now we're barreling toward the island our boat all the
[01:55:05] boat 600 men more less of the first battalion eight marines water churning boiling behind the boat
[01:55:13] we're bucketing and bouncing bullying ahead with our squared off bow musseling the water aside
[01:55:18] the boat is throwing spray soaking us and we're getting closer closer to the island
[01:55:24] we're about 800 yards from the shore when zip zip zip we hear tiny objects flying past
[01:55:29] and those aren't hornets boys their bullets we're in the range of the Japanese machine guns
[01:55:34] and good gosh they're shooting at us we find this interesting bullets zipping by
[01:55:40] splatting on the water surface splash splat here splat there splats to the left and right
[01:55:45] splats in front of us look by golly there's some enemy fire hitting right over there look over there
[01:55:51] that's me talking that's all of us talking talking and pointing at the impact circles in the water
[01:55:56] little splats little dots where bullets hit people shooting at us fascinating
[01:56:01] realizing that we could get our head shot off we ducked down and ducked down into the boat
[01:56:06] the more bullets splatting into the water but none hit our LCVP we tell ourselves that those are
[01:56:12] that most are 7.7 millimeter slugs which is what your basic light Japanese machine gun fires
[01:56:18] and are nothing really much to worry about because they're too small to pierce even the thin
[01:56:22] skined higgins boat that's what we tell ourselves all right but we really don't believe it
[01:56:28] we know good and well that the Japanese are also shooting at at us with heavier automatic weapon weapons
[01:56:33] big 13 millimeter machine guns and the even bigger dual purpose anti boat anti aircraft guns
[01:56:39] which range in size from 37 millimeter to 77 millimeter and they're lobbying shells from 70
[01:56:45] millimeter mountain howwitsers these weapons can and do inflict considerable damage on our
[01:56:52] salt teams killing and wounded hunting hundreds of them disabling or destroying many amtrax and
[01:56:58] LCVPs they're not my conceife concern however and never mind that they might at any second
[01:57:04] blow us to eternity what really bugs me is being hunkered down in this boat where I can't see anything
[01:57:09] I can't see where we are where we're going where we should be I can't observe the enemy fire
[01:57:14] engage resistance we're likely to encounter I feel as if I'm going into battle blindfolded
[01:57:19] this really stinks how can I do my job if I can't see anything how can I be sure the
[01:57:23] coxin is taking us to the right place my men what are they thinking they're watching me
[01:57:29] watching to see how I'm bearing up well I'm watching them too and for the same reason they look
[01:57:35] okay check that they look grim and resigned but that's good grim and resigned look means they've
[01:57:43] more or less accepted this situation which is also good because the situation isn't going to change
[01:57:47] unless it changes for the worse this whole thing is on the rails it's a runaway train and there's
[01:57:54] nothing going to stop it now if you know this if you accept it you can keep your fear under control
[01:57:59] and if you can keep your fear under control you'll do your job you won't let your buddies down
[01:58:05] so we're doing fine relatively speaking the boat is racing toward the shore when
[01:58:10] crying scraping bottom metal grinding on coral it abruptly stops we're thrown forward cursing
[01:58:17] we've run a ground all along the reef it's the same boat grinding to a halt on base
[01:58:22] yours fringing reef I think what the heck the tide is supposed to be up the water deep enough to
[01:58:28] allow the LCVPs to clear the reef we're 600 yards from the shore 600 long yards this just cannot be
[01:58:35] wrong it can be it is though we're not aware of it where victims of the same disagreeable
[01:58:45] title conditions that fouled up yesterday's landings this is as far as we go our cox and yells
[01:58:50] we're going on mode his passengers are not happy there are exclamations of astonishment and protest
[01:58:57] oh shit you gotta be kidding but he's not kidding yeah this is far as we go here repeats we're hung up
[01:59:02] we've hit the reef you gotta get out here then he works the controls that release the cables that
[01:59:07] hold the ramp up the cables which are still strong along the sides of the whole unwind with a
[01:59:13] macaalic metallic rasp the ramp screeches as it opens drops splashes into the water and there
[01:59:20] before us is basio in all its hideous glory not to exaggerate or overdramatize but it is a scene
[01:59:29] from hell i mean one second we're looking at this slab of a metal ramp then the ramp drops and
[01:59:34] we're looking at it in furno fire and smoke fill our bit frame of vision frame by the sides of the
[01:59:40] bottom and the bottom of the boat orange fire red fire and black black smoke the fire is shooting
[01:59:46] up the smoke is rolling curling climbing is fast and high the sky isn't high enough to contain it
[01:59:54] you think we were looking at a volcano being born you wonder what could produce so much smoke
[02:00:00] surely by now everything on basio that can burn has burned so where's all that smoke coming from
[02:00:06] from the bowels of the earth it would seem from somewhere deep underground under the ocean
[02:00:11] from the ever ever blazing furnaces of the world unless not forget the explosions there are a lot of
[02:00:17] them explosions here they're everywhere fire and fire balls tongues of flame crimson and yellow flashes in
[02:00:23] the smoke the time is 0-615 and some 600 marines are about to be launched or rather launch
[02:00:29] themselves at basio codenamed Helen i'm at the front of the boat the lieutenant the platoon leader
[02:00:37] time for me to lead a few seconds go by i was a few seconds ago i was deploying the limited
[02:00:45] protection offered by the thin metal ramp now i'm deploying the lack of that limited protection
[02:00:50] it was after all better than nothing which is what i've got now i kind of feel sick and i'm thinking
[02:00:58] god why am i in this mess what am i doing here but i'm resigned to the situation i've got to
[02:01:03] write it out no matter what happens no turning back now so the ramp hits the water and i run down
[02:01:12] the ramp clutching my m1 carbine waving my guys forward shouting let's go i sense that my
[02:01:17] manner hesitating by the pain no attention to them i jump into the water not knowing how deep it'll
[02:01:21] be thinking that i might jump into a shell hole and go all the way under but i land on coral and sand
[02:01:27] solid footing that's only five deep water relief and the water feels good that incredibly is my
[02:01:32] first thought the water feels good it's calm and warm like bath water almost soothing a pleasant
[02:01:38] contrast to the still cool morning air it's murky though sand and coral all stirred up beneath the
[02:01:44] surface none of that crystalline purity that comes to mind when you picture a tropical lagoon
[02:01:50] war comes to paradise and literally fouls it up i look sure word only 600 yards to go
[02:01:59] now the fellow that reached down and pulled me up over the ramp here a few months ago
[02:02:15] we ran across a photograph of him and what did it look like and a little bit of reference to
[02:02:23] his family but never never made a contact now this is as of within six months or so ago
[02:02:33] so this is and nobody and nobody else i talked to really knew who this guy was he was new to the
[02:02:40] outfit he was the sergeant he was new so but nobody knew him at reunions didn't know him
[02:02:46] so you look out there's six hundred and he and he and I were being lifted up by the
[02:02:55] by the transport and a bat sabisid and a basket and remote and says it just as we were okay
[02:03:03] just about up from the landing boat and in this basket taken a reason up to the transport itself
[02:03:12] and i made a comment says looks like looks like we made it his comment was you made it you made it
[02:03:22] and he died so you look down going back to this point when the ramp actually opens and you see you've
[02:03:30] got 600 yards to go and just nothing but machine gun fire and as you said earlier the Japanese
[02:03:37] you'd watch them storm forward without any ability to maneuver just only thing to do with the salt
[02:03:43] and now here you are we are no maneuver in the exact same situation yeah we're in there saving
[02:03:49] in completely at their mercy you say here 600 yards six football fields just under a third of a
[02:03:57] mile if you run that distance on dry land unencumbered and unimposed you'll be gasping at the
[02:04:03] finish line i don't care what kind of shape you're in we're in water and we're wearing and
[02:04:07] carrying 60 pounds or more of gear and the Japanese are ripping us apart they've got an absolutely
[02:04:13] clear field of fire and we have to walk straight into it when i returned and i looked i went
[02:04:19] clear out there where i was hit and walked in and i saw remains of old carbines and so on down in
[02:04:25] the sand we've got a walk not run because we're in the water remember walk slowly because we
[02:04:36] can't run we can't even walk fast the marines are the world's experts in amphibious warfare the
[02:04:42] core has been training for the past two decades to assault an established beach head on a hostile
[02:04:47] shore it has developed complex doctrines to guide us in such endeavors at bayjio on 21 November
[02:04:53] 1943 all that training in doctrine doctrine has come to this we step out of our LCVPs into shallow
[02:04:59] water and walk slowly across 600 yards with absolutely no cover whatsoever to make a frontal assault
[02:05:06] on heavily fortified and defended enemy positions on my website just go to it by my name just
[02:05:16] Dean Lad there is a poem in here called curtains of fire and it goes in a great detail similar
[02:05:23] kind of words but done done a little differently and it's so that's where that's where it's all spilled out
[02:05:34] you you say some training in some doctrine that they've been working on that's your quote
[02:05:38] we cannot believe the volume of fire that's coming from the island the air is just filled with bullets
[02:05:44] we can't see them but we can see where they hit splat splat splat like raime drops dotting the
[02:05:50] water dot pattern sweeping back and forth across our line curtains a curtain of fire it's called
[02:05:56] curtain of fire passing over us through us yeah I realize oh my god the Japanese have got this
[02:06:02] reef zeroed in which means they don't even have to aim their machine guns they just lock the guns
[02:06:07] to a predetermined setting and traverse the barrel left and right left and right just a lot
[02:06:12] along the reef like shooting a fish in a barrel yeah yeah major haze was right he said we'd be going
[02:06:19] in standing up and that's what we're doing not that we want to there's no other way no place to run
[02:06:24] no place to hide some men crowds in the water they watch the bullet patterns the curtains trying
[02:06:29] to figure out when the curtain will sweep over them it's all a matter of timing they'll duck
[02:06:33] under water at the right moment to avoid getting shot it would be a good plan if only there were
[02:06:38] two if only there were one or two machine guns firing at them but there are many many machine
[02:06:42] guns firing creating multiple curtains that meet and intermingle an overlap and crisscross
[02:06:47] yeah bullets are flying every which way worse the guns are aimed to fire just inches above the
[02:06:53] surface so if you crouch with your head just above the water you're likely to get your head drilled
[02:06:59] might as well stand up that way you'll get shot the chest or stomach which is usually fatal
[02:07:04] instead of to the head which is almost always fatal also if you're crouching in the water you're
[02:07:10] not moving and if you're not moving your stationary target and your easier to shoot you have to
[02:07:15] keep moving you have to get to shore get a shore or die and the whole thing orders were don't
[02:07:21] stop to help anybody everybody's going to get killed just you get sure stuff in my man that's
[02:07:29] stop to help me violate those orders that told him don't wait for me go on no they they just took
[02:07:36] a stick around walking straight into curtains of machine gun fires not something that comes naturally
[02:07:44] your instinct's oppose it every fiber of your beam being seems screams in protest resisting
[02:07:51] telling you no way it hell am I going to do that that's why when I glance over my shoulder to see
[02:07:57] how my man are doing I see that I haven't that many haven't left the boat a few most likely those
[02:08:03] that are just next to me in the boat are in the water but the others are bunched up at the top of
[02:08:06] the ramp all tensed up to take the plunge but hesitating unable to make themselves move I can't
[02:08:13] blame themselves for hanging back but I can't allow it for one thing they make a big fat target
[02:08:19] standing they're crowded together at the front of the boat they've got to get into the water
[02:08:23] and disperse before the Japanese machine guns find them and wipe them out with a couple well place
[02:08:27] purse but more important they've got a job to do they've got to get off the boat get a sure
[02:08:32] and fight and kill Japanese I gesture them and shout come on guys let's go get moving move out
[02:08:38] they obey me they get moving they're good men the best they charge down the ramp jump
[02:08:46] feet first in the water start waiting toward the shore and that's when the slaughter really begins
[02:08:51] right away the men around me my men are taking hits and falling I'm very aware of this
[02:08:57] I'm hearing cries for help cries for corpsmen the wounded are calling out corpsmen corpsmen I'm
[02:09:01] hit I'm hit over here they're calling out as loud as they can I see men going under
[02:09:06] often for the last time what do I do I keep moving forward that's what cries for help everywhere
[02:09:13] and I ignore them I have to you get hot you get hit you just have to keep going you have to
[02:09:18] cope with it yourself do the best you can hope for the best the sounds of battle are everywhere
[02:09:24] there are those sweeping slashing curtains of fire dozens of machine guns rattling a
[02:09:29] a cacophony of staccato hammering artillery shells exploding in the water splashing throwing up
[02:09:37] washing gaizers of water and human body parts and most especially most memory the shouts and
[02:09:43] screams of the wounded in the dying oh god I'm hit corpsmen over here corpsmen help me help me please
[02:09:52] manner dropping everywhere to the left and right me falling and sinking into the water going
[02:09:56] under some men don't cry out hardly make a sound when they're hit the bullet or bullets
[02:10:01] thump into them they grunt and they're gone we're not permitted to help them the corpsmen can
[02:10:06] come to the raid but but not the rest of us our orders are to move on to get to shore as fast as we can
[02:10:12] if we stop the help the wounded will get shot too and we won't make it to the beach where we're
[02:10:17] needed so we keep waiting forward my men my men from other boats the entire battalion what's
[02:10:24] left of it struggling through the water holding the rifles over their heads pushing through
[02:10:28] toward the beach and into the teeth of all that infillating gunfire they're courage is incredible
[02:10:34] that world only begins to describe it insulating from that beach to British transport or ship
[02:10:44] crossfire you guys are it yeah shells exploding washing gaizers machine guns rattling
[02:10:52] splat splat splat those little dots in the water thousands of them moving this way and that
[02:10:56] a bullet hits four feet to my right splat splat then bullets hit three feet two foot one foot to my
[02:11:02] right sure do hope they skip over me and they do this time splat they begin hitting to my left one
[02:11:07] foot two foot three foot and so on I got lucky I literally dodged the bullet several bullets how
[02:11:13] long will my luck hold I can't see any muzzle flashes from the enemy guns the Japanese are invisible
[02:11:18] just like their bullets we're being slaughtered by an invisible force nothing to see nothing to shoot at
[02:11:25] not that we would be shooting if we could see them you don't stand an open water shooting at the
[02:11:29] enemy you get yourself to the beach you take cover and then you start shooting anyway my weapon
[02:11:34] isn't good for shooting at long and medium ranges for that matter it's not much good at close range
[02:11:40] either it's an m1 carbine a pathetic excuse for a fire arm a weakling with a weakling punch
[02:11:46] I'm holding it at port arms across my chest as I weigh through the water maybe there'll be a stop
[02:11:50] maybe there'll be a maybe it will stop a bullet that would otherwise kill me that's about all the
[02:11:55] good it can do me I walk on pushing forward straining to move faster the water drag me at my thighs
[02:12:01] no one ever said a speed rucker record running in five deep water I've gone about 100 yards only
[02:12:09] 500 yards to go we're taking fire from the front from both flanks from the rear
[02:12:17] the rear what the hell and that's what you talk about that's the that's the uh
[02:12:21] uh sunken ship that's out there and there's well no no there are planes here now our planes
[02:12:27] are coming in and strapping and we wonder what is going on of this when they were they were
[02:12:32] strapping that ship I returned to the task at hand keep moving to the shore how long has
[02:12:41] this been going on how long have been out here in the water I can't say I have no sense of time
[02:12:45] everything is moving in slow motion second seems to last minutes minute seemed to last hours
[02:12:50] it just keeps going on and on every moment is intense filled with intense thoughts emotions actions
[02:12:56] I'm thinking how can I protect myself how can I protect my men someone screams another one of my
[02:13:01] men is hit and another and another help corpsman some are killed outright some are wounded
[02:13:06] some are well it's hard to say some go quietly some noisely they fall back in the water they
[02:13:12] slip onto the water some flail in the water and they're paying in panic howling and shouting
[02:13:16] I keep moving my adrenaline is flowing like an electric current through me allowing me to do things
[02:13:22] I wouldn't normally and shouldn't normally do if I stop to think about what I'm doing I'd freeze up
[02:13:27] I try to track the bullets the movement in patterns of the enemy's traversing fire the bullets
[02:13:32] impact start to my left to my right the bullets sweeping back and forth I see no pattern
[02:13:37] or rather I see too many patterns splat splat splat everywhere it's like the enemy throwing
[02:13:41] thousands and thousands of stones at us a pattern of splats in the water comes towards me from the right
[02:13:47] sweeps pass me continue to the left I don't hear the crack of the bullets as they zip by
[02:13:51] its supersonic speed that's the problem they're not zipping past us they're hitting us they've got
[02:13:56] our range I'm in the impact zone I have to get through it or die I turned to look back at my
[02:14:00] men let's go I call out for the umpteenth time I turn facing this shore then finally it happens
[02:14:07] a sickening splat like an inner tube being snapped across my abdomen slapping my bare stomach a sharp
[02:14:14] staying sensation I'm hit I hear myself say a bullet is struck me nearly dead center below the
[02:14:20] naval piercing me above the water line I'm gut shot one of the worst wounds of all oh god
[02:14:28] I've probably been hit by small caliber machine gun bullet fired from straight ahead on the beach
[02:14:37] it didn't make much of an impact not long enough to knock me off my feet or even stagger me
[02:14:41] later I would learn to tour right through my body piercing my intestines later and goodness it didn't
[02:14:46] hit a bone yeah so it pierced your intestines bladder and sacrum just before that
[02:14:55] and an exited missing my spinal nerve by a quarter of an inch as it is I'll probably
[02:15:04] die in a few minutes I'm scared I think my gosh this is it if it happens that you get shot
[02:15:11] and you don't know how bad the wound it often happens that you get shot you don't know how bad
[02:15:14] the wound is but when you're hit where I was hit you know it's bad it's a gut wound and you
[02:15:20] know it's pretty sure thing you're not going to make it very few people survive gut wounds even in the
[02:15:26] best of circumstances I'm in what are arguably the worst of circumstances if I had been shot on
[02:15:33] try land I might be able to crawl to an aid station or my buddies might have passed me up but I'm
[02:15:38] in a lagoon so there can be no crawling and my buddies are forbidden to help me it goes without saying
[02:15:43] that there are no aid stations close by I can try to reach our LCVPs on the reef a hundred yards
[02:15:49] behind me but I probably won't make it I'm dying is why I don't my gear into the water off goes my
[02:15:57] pack my helmet my webbing the walkie talkie slung over my shoulder goodbye m1 carbine into the drink
[02:16:02] you go never shot fired an anger it takes just seconds for me to shock my equipment in those seconds
[02:16:07] I lose most of my strength after a few more seconds I'm almost too weak to stand it happens that
[02:16:13] fast the energy is draining out of me I'm going into shock the weakness doesn't paralyze me and it
[02:16:18] doesn't come from any place in particular it's an overall sort of feeling that makes me go heavy and
[02:16:23] limp I'm in pain but it's not too bad not yet and I'm not bleeding very much either but I'm
[02:16:29] slipping away no doubt about it my biggest worry now is that I'll collapse sink beneath the surface
[02:16:35] and drown all I want to do is keep my head above water so I won't drown before I die from
[02:16:40] the bullet that reamed through me I know this isn't rational what differences and make how I die
[02:16:45] drowning or dying from getting my inner scrambled by a bullet either way I'm a garner and soon
[02:16:51] but I'm not thinking rationally I'm thinking I've got to keep my head above water period maybe
[02:16:57] 10 seconds have passed since I got shot that is all in that time the man close to me
[02:17:03] PFC Thomas F Sullivan has hastened to my side Lieutenant where are you hitting ass I tell him he pulls
[02:17:09] up my Dungary jacket checks my wound so long as the puttons eight ball a nice guy just a teenager
[02:17:16] but he's got a wild streak he's always getting in a trouble you can bet dollars to donuts when
[02:17:20] he goes on liberty he lays the dick and gets arrested and afterwards spent a few days in the
[02:17:25] brig is punishment this happened in New Zealand before we left for Tarrawer this happens everywhere
[02:17:31] we go it's standard operating procedure for Sullivan you can put you can count on him to kick
[02:17:37] up a road to put him in low key to mat for is I try to never good I know he survives a war oh
[02:17:43] he definitely survives yeah and you're happy that right now he's the kind of guy that's rebellious
[02:17:49] because he's dope diso-bang the orders which the orders are you keep going and he looks at you and
[02:17:54] says no you know I thought as I got her so why why have somebody else die trying to help me
[02:18:00] another guy joins him pft. Duffy also remember my petute and also with Tima Kiddoo does know how to
[02:18:09] fall. When I returned this last time I found out where he was buried. Duffy yeah yeah
[02:18:21] and you even say you'd think you'd be happy that these guys were staying with you but you're actually
[02:18:25] thinking which is what they were disobeying orders and they were gonna lose their lives too.
[02:18:32] And finally they say we're staying with you where do you want us to take you to the beach or to the
[02:18:36] boat and you opt for the boat. Yeah. It takes about 10 minutes to reach the nearest LCVP.
[02:18:45] The boats crowded with other wounded Marines other wounded men are being dragged to the boat by their
[02:18:50] buddies. Evidently Sullivan and Duffy weren't the only one to ignore the order to ignore the wounded.
[02:18:55] The wounded men and the rescuers are clustered in front of the ramp which is about three quarters
[02:19:01] raised. One by one the wounded men are half pushed half flung over the top of the ramp after which
[02:19:06] they rolled down onto the deck my turn comes. The man next to me is that big fellow with the
[02:19:11] ravaged face. His wounded is terrible worse than mine. I motion for him to go before me. He is boosted
[02:19:17] up to the top of the ramp. Sullivan lifts me up. I'm groaning like mad. The pain is getting worse.
[02:19:22] I'm really hurting really bad now. My helpers can't quite get me over the top. I'm limp and heavy.
[02:19:27] A bulky sack of flesh and bone with a hole in it and they just can't manage to raise me high enough.
[02:19:33] That's when the Marine with the ravaged face performs his life saving deed. One army me into the boat.
[02:19:40] How did he do that? He must be in torment from his wound but that didn't stop him from helping me.
[02:19:45] I tumble groaning down onto the dock alongside the man with the ravaged face. The deck is covered
[02:19:52] with the main and wounded men. Their bodies bandages and bloody many writhing and pain.
[02:19:57] Many just groaning just like me. Another wounded man is taking aboard. The ramp is then
[02:20:02] closed and the boat begins to move. The coxon aware that our lives are hanging. The balance
[02:20:07] opens. The throttle wide and soon we're going full tilt racing through the channel in the barrier
[02:20:13] reef toward the Sheridan. This description I think is the best description I've ever heard of
[02:20:23] of that kind of combat. Well, yeah you take a scene of small line. Your line burger is
[02:20:29] he's increasing credible. He does a lot of writing. He worked with
[02:20:35] a guy handed up the Chicago Tribune. He worked with him regarding the army unit that was
[02:20:42] in more or more too. Then he wrote this about the Polish woman that was in the Jewish woman.
[02:20:51] That was survived the time that they were almost killed. It's incredible.
[02:21:00] That's the end of the tunnel of battle for you. Lasted what? 20 minutes? I guess 20 hours
[02:21:14] in 20 minutes because you did the first 20 hours circle around. You give a great account
[02:21:21] from all the people that were there that got interviewed.
[02:21:25] The next time he's pushing in the fighting at taro. It's really all taking place at this sea wall.
[02:21:36] Later on, later on he was in the motorcycle officer in the LA. He's been in accidents and
[02:21:47] shot at it. He hospitalized 20 times. Oh my gosh. Yeah, these guys getting a sure a few
[02:22:02] seconds later, dick steps a sure. This is what you're being loaded down the Sheraton.
[02:22:08] Yes. Momently loaded. He said to himself, well, they ain't going to give me now.
[02:22:12] Then he looked around in his elation evaporated nearby, led dead marine with a Japanese bayonet
[02:22:18] protruding from his chest and three dead Japanese soldiers sprawled around him. Dead bodies were
[02:22:22] everywhere floating in the water, piling up at the waterline, strewn about the beach.
[02:22:26] Guys from the second marine to a landed the day before. Guys from the eighth marine's too.
[02:22:30] And many Japanese, the beach was strewn with rifles as well as bodies and he took one off of the
[02:22:35] dead marine and took the man's ammo clips as well. Now he could fight back. And then another
[02:22:43] guy named Hester, Hester, collected his men and led them back to the sea wall. They found the perfect
[02:22:48] example of taking leadership. This Hester called Big Hester. What happened with him? Well,
[02:22:54] he's able to gather people together and they let go. That's the guy is not how much
[02:23:02] it's on Mars. I say about him. I mean, there were two brothers. One brother was killed. His younger
[02:23:08] brother was killed on Guadalcanel, but the time when I was killed. Well, you start talking here
[02:23:16] about him and Hester and then Murdoch. Yeah. And he said, Hester, they found Murdoch near a wrecked
[02:23:23] damn track in the mad rush to reach the sea wall and jump over it. Duffy somehow got separated
[02:23:27] from the group and they never saw him again. Never saw him. He was killed. The guy that saved
[02:23:32] your life sitting with his back the wall taking a breather dick looked over the cord the shore
[02:23:36] immediately behind Murdoch. The incoming waves washed the dead marines onto the shore and pushed
[02:23:41] them into small piles. It looked like a little mound and at the top of that mound facing the
[02:23:45] sky was Anthony Boyle. His helmet was off in the top of his head. He was shot on the ground.
[02:23:48] On that same oil. A number of years ago, Murdoch, I and another one or two, went to a big
[02:23:55] memorial for him in New York. Overlooking the Hudson. And we had one Lieutenant General
[02:24:04] Boomer was with us and he was one of the spokesman for the fighting in the jury involved in.
[02:24:13] He was a guy and the main guy. So he was there with us. But we had a big ceremony in a big
[02:24:21] Catholic church. We had a parade downtown. So the downtown was a big event. And this is what
[02:24:30] happened to him. That's what happened to him. Is. Yeah. Only seconds before Oboil had been standing
[02:24:37] next to Murdoch period over the world. Then a Japanese bullet took off the top of his head and he fell
[02:24:42] back into John's arm. John created Oboil in his arms for a long moment before laying him gently
[02:24:47] aside. Someone else must have hauled him up to the pile of bodies at the water's edge to get away
[02:24:52] from the wall. During this time, someone from the company passed Dick's position and informed
[02:24:57] that Duffy had been killed. Duffy was a very quiet person. Never talked to him much, but it really
[02:25:01] nice to hear. Dick remembered. He was a little older than the most of us in his earlier mid-20s,
[02:25:09] which made him an old man in our outfit. He was Oboil's best buddy. Now they were both dead
[02:25:15] killed within minutes of each other. For everyone involved Americans, Japanese, there's a peculiar,
[02:25:27] peculiar nasty way to fight a war. The situation favored the defenders, but only two
[02:25:31] appoint battles are won, not by staying in fortifications that are won by attacking. And on
[02:25:36] Baygio, the Marines, we never saw the enemy. Because they were there soon, he had to hear from
[02:25:41] a, from a whole out of a hole somewhere. They had to assault each and every Japanese position,
[02:25:47] making short rushes across open ground through murderous fire. Heavy casualties were the result,
[02:25:52] but ultimately, Japanese casualties were heavier. In fact, almost total. The Japanese would not yield
[02:25:58] because their military ethos forbade it to beat them. You had to kill them. But the Marines
[02:26:03] would not quit, and they could not be stopped. Against the foes, such as the Marines with their
[02:26:09] absolute determination and capability to win, the initial advantages enjoyed by defenders fighting
[02:26:14] from a concealment could have won outcome. A annihilation. Now I have a, I have a book here written
[02:26:21] by one of the Japanese defenders. And I wanted to meet him when I went there and met two other
[02:26:29] Japanese officers. But we never, we never, we never actually able to get together. We were on a
[02:26:35] phone. But the name, the name we were called, I'll see what they called, called Heavenly,
[02:26:44] something rather. They believed that I went to a heaven too. There's a different kind of heaven.
[02:26:50] And they died. Continuant all of this. Yes, yes, a coney shrine for one place.
[02:26:59] OK. You know, the officers, especially, we will be again in the S. Coney shrine.
[02:27:05] And this one officer that I met on Guadalconeo and who I got in a real well, we
[02:27:10] we of course, minor for about 15 years. And talked a lot about the, I learned a lot about their,
[02:27:21] their whole background of their Bouchito code. No, let's talk.
[02:27:25] I've read on this podcast. I've read some of letters that the Kamakaze pilots would write.
[02:27:32] Because they would write a letter before they would go and die. Yeah. And, and there's also,
[02:27:37] there's also talk of how like they would write these letters. But some of them were not writing
[02:27:44] from the heart. Yeah, what? And as they, when they, when they die, sometimes they would cut off their fingernails.
[02:27:50] And that would be sent back. Now, this one, this one, one fellow who had just been killed,
[02:27:55] he was in a go for like hole, who just starting our final drive. And that's where I,
[02:28:01] I got the diary from him and the thousand, whole, a stitched belt. And all that kind of stuff.
[02:28:08] And anyway, I had the, I had a little, little piece of part of a hair that had long to
[02:28:21] think and long to his, his girlfriend or something. Anyway, I just want to send all that back.
[02:28:27] And that, when, when the, when the soldier was killed, the life, and that would have been his wife.
[02:28:33] The wife is supposed to take care of his family. Instead, she had remarried. She felt bad about it.
[02:28:39] When she saw this, saw what he had written, but one of her remarried. What did you understand me?
[02:28:45] Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[02:28:52] Again, jumping ahead a little bit, because people need to get the books, they can read it for themselves.
[02:28:59] But the casually told was nothing less than catastrophic. The New Zealand, the company,
[02:29:03] had been beefed up into a little more than 200 men to give it an extra punch in the assault.
[02:29:07] 90 were lost, killed, or wounded in the Bayesian Lagoon. In other words, nearly half the company was
[02:29:13] out of action before anyone stepped ashore. The men Murdoch found on the beach were all exhausted.
[02:29:19] And with the terrible look on their face, that's according to Murdoch. But their shocking
[02:29:23] exhaust did not could not concern him. What I was more interested in was who's alive and who I
[02:29:27] have I got. What have I got? To make that assessment, he continued rounding up the guys in the beach
[02:29:34] and taking them back to his area.
[02:29:41] All the wild Vietnamese fire was flailing on the beach, John ignored it. When Anthony
[02:29:44] Oboil was shot and fell into his arms, he wasn't faced. And once he laid Oboil,
[02:29:49] Oboil's twitching body aside, he didn't think about him anymore that day. He didn't have time,
[02:29:54] much less the inclination to grieve for Oboil or to feel horror for the slow,
[02:29:58] hideous way of all of that. See at that point of time, our battalion, especially our company,
[02:30:05] led by Murdoch, were wiping out the last resistance. It was a hard, it was really a
[02:30:16] real determined group fighting there. And that's where we lost right now. One of the people
[02:30:21] that's in this picture here, he got shot by fellow down in a hole like a little spider hole
[02:30:26] where he caught. And up in his gut killed him instantly. He died thinking that he died, thinking that
[02:30:32] I'd be just been killed. I visit his family in Tennessee afterwards and they were still so sad that
[02:30:43] they didn't even want to hear more about it. Didn't even want to talk to me about it. Progress is
[02:30:52] eventually made toward the middle of the day, Bill noticed that seems things seem to be going a
[02:30:56] little bit better for the Marines. They seem to be making some progress. Bulldozers had landed by
[02:31:00] that. And they pushed up against the pillbox entrances, sealing them and intuming the Japanese
[02:31:06] inside. But the flame throwers really did the trick. A flame thrower on. So one of those
[02:31:11] that was inside, I ran into the first time returned, first time I returned to Terala. And he had been
[02:31:18] been in the Navy for many, many years, probably a little over 20 years. And he was in charge of the
[02:31:25] mess area. And then he had been transferred from there to New Guinea just before we landed. That's
[02:31:33] why how he survived. Oh, so he so just before he landed, he had been transferred. Yeah, he had been
[02:31:39] gone. Well, he, you know, maybe a month before some period of time. Right, right. That's the only
[02:31:44] reason. So he wrote that. So now here he is, he returned, same time, I'm idea, and I met him,
[02:31:49] you know. And I showed him the picture of the one, the one, the Japanese soldier that, what they
[02:31:56] do with they put, they put their toll in the, and pull the trigger of the rifle, and point
[02:32:02] it right up there, I've got him out. And he was doing that. And he saw that. And he, the reaction
[02:32:08] from there was already something. It was for you something. And he saw that picture, he says, yeah.
[02:32:14] Yeah, there's been a lot. Man. Here's what here's what Murdoch says as the, as the fighting kind of comes to
[02:32:27] an end. As they get to the end, all of a sudden things began to move. We were moving, but very,
[02:32:33] very slowly like a snail. My guys would go out ahead of me. Then they'd be moving and I'd run up
[02:32:38] with my gang and get behind them. We were all very close. The enemy, a matter of feet, not yards. It
[02:32:43] was small, very slow progress. But it was progress nonetheless. For the first time since they landed
[02:32:48] the day before, the men of B company were advancing and not falling back after each forward push.
[02:32:53] The Japanese meant to fight to the last man, and they were coming ever closer to realizing that
[02:32:57] goal. Marine assault teams mostly add hawk assemblages, destroyed the enemy bunkers one after
[02:33:02] another, killing the Japanese while they're inside, or when they ran out, the Japanese were
[02:33:07] literally slain in heaps, as their numbers were reduced, so as the volume and intensity of their
[02:33:12] fire. Finally, when John and his men in advance as far as they could, the battle just sort of
[02:33:18] Petered out. The shooting stopped bringing silence to their sector of the battlefield and leaving
[02:33:22] everyone stunned by the abrupt end to the fighting. They didn't know quite what to do, we just kind of
[02:33:28] sat there and did nothing. The next day, first battalion marched over to the pier where the LCVB
[02:33:37] waited to take them back to the Sheridan. On their way, they witnessed a dual flag raising ceremony
[02:33:44] for the stars and stripes in the British Union Jack with a representative from his Majesty's
[02:33:48] government presiding. The stars and stripes went up first, but the Union Jack was given the place
[02:33:53] of pride and honor on a higher pole and acknowledgement of the British sovereignty over the Taroa
[02:33:58] toll. There were some muddled complaints for the men of the one eight, but not much.
[02:34:03] Most just smiled grimly and shook their heads. Great Britain may have held the title to Bejio,
[02:34:10] but the Marine Corps truly owned it. Well, I recurrent the first time.
[02:34:14] I recurrent the first time in 82 and I stayed with missionaries there for a couple of days or more.
[02:34:27] Then during that time, we all decided to, okay, there was the breakaway and that church group.
[02:34:37] Part of it is going to another church just a thatch type of a place and walking hand walk through
[02:34:44] some kind of a jungle area to get there. They had it, we sat down and I spoke and asked him to
[02:34:56] sing and they just loved to sing. And then it's not, you got to sing the Marine Hill.
[02:35:03] Then what happened was I didn't really sing it. I said, now we'll sing it. The words, I mean,
[02:35:12] we'll sing the tune of it. It was a love song based on a hymn. It was kind of two iterations of
[02:35:25] apparently and then I had to then I told him a little bit about, well, you know, that's interesting.
[02:35:30] And I said, down, these words and I went through the words to a certain extent.
[02:35:38] Well, that was so interesting. But here they sang that song that was the love song. Like
[02:35:42] same as our Marine Hill. Oh, then after that, I invited him over to the other church that they
[02:35:49] had spent off from and I had got a hold of the film that was done by a government norm hatch.
[02:35:57] He was recently died away. He's one took all these pictures. Come back photos. It was
[02:36:01] inverted by the way. And anyway, I played that for them and it showed that flag rising and these kids,
[02:36:11] they all scythe and the Marine Hill flag and they were real quiet. The British flag one just like
[02:36:17] was described in here. Here's the results. The battle for Bayesian lasted 76 hours. Some 4,690
[02:36:29] Japanese troops, about 97% of the garrison died. A mere 17 Japanese were taken prisoner
[02:36:36] as were 129 laborers. The second, these most of these were Korean laborers. Yeah. The
[02:36:42] second Marine Division suffered 3,407 casualties of these 1,150 Marines and sailors were killed
[02:36:49] in another 2,292 were wounded. These Salt units lost 41% of their men dead and wounded.
[02:36:56] The first Patanian 8th Marines lost more than 30% of its men just getting to the beach.
[02:37:02] There's probably, there could be as many as 400 still there. Three or 400,
[02:37:06] still there, because they're under homes under park and lots and so on. Overall, the battalion suffered
[02:37:13] 343 casualties on their naked. When I was there, the third time. And here the archaeologist
[02:37:22] was brushing about brushing off the bones and on this one person, no, that and two of the two of them
[02:37:30] they found wedding rings on their, something huh? And I saw that as they were doing it. Yeah.
[02:37:40] casualties in my platoon were 12 killed and 15 wounded, including myself 75% of its original
[02:37:46] strength, most were hit while waiting to shore. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And you can look at the faces of all
[02:37:57] these that were killed in this one photograph. And you talk about the news clipping,
[02:38:04] sort of the news stories that were reported about Taram. Yeah. Okay. And part of it, I always was told
[02:38:11] that they released some of these, it was the first time that they really released a lot of
[02:38:16] events. It's a very, very long one that one that general public realized, you know, this is not going
[02:38:21] to be easy. This is what it's really like. Just terrific combat photos, home and credible.
[02:38:29] Yeah. And those were the first ones showing mass casualties in my arrogance. Yeah. You, you've
[02:38:34] probably seen that one. Oh, yeah, I've seen it. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, Norm Hatch. Just wanted to do that.
[02:38:39] Oh, so that is him. Okay. Norm Hatch. Oh, yeah. I got no real well. Yeah.
[02:38:44] All right. And in the end, we just read this book, I published, was there's a Colonel Alexander,
[02:38:52] Joseph Alexander died the last, in the last year for years. Anyway, he was the, he was the
[02:38:59] prime historian for the Marine Corps. And, and then he was very well thought of
[02:39:07] the name of the list to press. So when it came to making a proposal to enable us to press,
[02:39:14] it had to go through their, uh, through their border review scene. And then after that, no, I
[02:39:22] seen that. It had to go through, it had to go through your, when it, what's the word for it?
[02:39:27] Somebody has the same, same mountain as you do. I pretty much, anyway, this Joseph Alexander
[02:39:33] was one of the prime ones that did, did, did it when my peer review. Okay. And then when that,
[02:39:39] so that when that got to the, to the review board, oh, he says, fine. So I'd just say,
[02:39:47] you're laying on through, you know. And then now, my book was on the first ones to go on as
[02:39:54] an ebook, first ones for the press. And I have the ads or some of the, the, the, the proceeds magazine.
[02:40:02] Yeah. That shows, shows that they're displayed. One of them is with, uh, with Papay going to,
[02:40:08] is on that same page with him. Well, yeah, this is available on ebook for those of you that
[02:40:13] want to get it, and can't wait to get it. You get immediately. Just go straight to ebook.
[02:40:17] Not only that. Yeah, that too. And not only that. When they go through, and it goes through, and it
[02:40:21] goes up, going through email, I read to, uh, what's, what is it, uh, Amazon.com. It'll be delivery,
[02:40:29] you know, matter about three days or less. And, and, and, no, no shipping costs.
[02:40:35] Yeah, that's the way Amazon works. Oh, it's an amazing deal. I do. I don't understand. Yeah. And,
[02:40:42] I don't know if there's, there's, but that's where I got my copies. So, yeah, you can get, I have
[02:40:49] the hardcover and the softcover. Yeah, both. Yes. I don't play around with the music. You know,
[02:40:53] when you get ebooks, they cost three versus three quarters of much as a, uh, one of those. Yeah.
[02:41:01] That's, the publishing world is very strange. Taking it now to where you get onto the
[02:41:09] Sheridan. So now this is, this is, uh, no sooner than my stretcher touched down on the Sheridan's deck
[02:41:14] that I was west away into the operating room. I was one of the first wounded marines to be treated
[02:41:19] and the medical team was fresh and rested and ready to go to work on me. I guess that qualifies as
[02:41:23] a stroke of good luck. Even better fortunate awaited me in the operating room in the form of
[02:41:29] lieutenant commander Lloyd Sussex formally an abdominal, an abdominal specialist at the Mayo Clinic.
[02:41:37] Now the key member of three-man team, Dr. Two doctors in a corpsman that would say,
[02:41:41] there you go. How lucky is that you had a guy. Unbelievable. And, I'm part of the shift.
[02:41:45] And that's all there was. And if I gone unsure, I would have died. And most other places you,
[02:41:52] you wouldn't have an abdominal specialist. And then it says the operation last about an hour.
[02:41:57] I was conscious the whole time and didn't feel any pain. No, they didn't want their put me out because
[02:42:01] I died. I was in shock. And the doctor spent most of that hour bent over my lower body.
[02:42:08] And although I could not see what they were doing, I could hear a little clicking and
[02:42:10] sniffing sounds made by their instruments as they worked. They repaired my bladder and removed
[02:42:15] a portion of my large intestine and gave me a blood transfusion. Then they closed my wound and that was
[02:42:19] that. Yeah, and didn't need a half of a bay of afterwards. I had made it through surgery. But
[02:42:25] he'd been a close call. Dr. Sussex told me that I could not have survived another two hours
[02:42:29] because of the toxins that were building up inside. And that right after the right after the
[02:42:33] operation I was kept in a hot, covered tent. And it was miserable. I kept trying to shove it off
[02:42:40] they had they had a carman sitting there with me all night long to keep me even throwing it off.
[02:42:46] And then another couple of days I was able to walk into the watch and move me with their
[02:42:51] blood. People couldn't be here. I was walking in there to see the movie. They couldn't believe it.
[02:42:55] I mean you were as good as dad. Got shot in. Unbelievable. Not even to the beach yet.
[02:43:00] Yeah, they had very people survive period. I got shot. Very few. Because he told me he said
[02:43:07] I talked to him later and said, yeah, you know the poison in your system. You wouldn't
[02:43:13] you wouldn't have lasted another couple more. No hour or two that was it. And here's up in an hour
[02:43:19] about an hour or an hour or an hour after I was hit. I was just unbelievable.
[02:43:26] There's unbelievable. You say a few days later I was checked over by a younger doctor, a gloomy
[02:43:31] fellow with a bit with a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a match. You told me don't flu that my wound
[02:43:35] was very serious and that I wouldn't live much past my 50s. Yeah. Well, sort of doctor says such
[02:43:40] that they do his patients. I reported his words to Dr. Soxix, who's who's appalled.
[02:43:45] He shouldn't have told you that. Soxix said and there's no truth through it anyways. And I guess
[02:43:48] we're improving that right now. Soxix, if you're talking about it. Well, now what happened to him?
[02:43:54] A year later he was operating on a guy at Ferregette Naval Training Center. This is Soxix.
[02:43:59] Yes. And here he's about 55 years old. He died of a heart attack. He was
[02:44:04] operating on that guy. And I've talked, I've talked in Mayo Clinic about that. And then
[02:44:08] there's people that are written up a lot of history about that. They written a little bit about
[02:44:12] Sussex. And I gave a lot of information too. But so anyway, that's this end of the story all with him.
[02:44:20] In, uh, lad, like you said, you come walking up their plane of moving.
[02:44:24] Yeah. Yeah. You know, the best that you come walking about up my buddies could hardly prove
[02:44:27] believe their eyes. Oh my god, look, here's lad. They did the exclaimed.
[02:44:30] Yeah. Yeah. First they thought I was dead. Then they were told those grieves he wounded all
[02:44:33] to her up a basket case. And now here I was walking into the movie theater. How many days
[02:44:38] it have been? It couldn't have been more three days. Oh, man. Uh, while I was
[02:44:46] really, you know, all was in a hospital. They must get around. It's fast as possible. Anyway.
[02:44:50] Okay. Yeah. While I was recovering from my surgery, John Murdoch dropped by to give me a
[02:44:55] samurai sword. He had survived. He had proven near to unbezier. Yeah. Hold it from me until I returned.
[02:45:01] He said he assumed that I'd gotten a million dollar wound. It would be sent home. I thought the same.
[02:45:07] Left unspoken, but implicit and what he said was that he didn't think you'd be coming home.
[02:45:12] The sword was probably mine to keep. Yeah. He was, it was, his was a common sentiment.
[02:45:19] I would venture to say that after Taroa, most second division Marines didn't believe
[02:45:23] they would make it through the war. Yeah. Because you're looking at the entire rest of the island
[02:45:28] campaigns and then you got to go into mainland Japan. And it's going to be a bloody fight the
[02:45:32] whole way. Oh, boy, if they had that bomb had not dropped. It's horrible saying, but gee. Murdoch took
[02:45:40] a head count of B company using a pretty battle roster for reference checking off one name after
[02:45:45] the other from the list. He had known that the toll would be large, but even he was shocked by the
[02:45:51] final count. My god, he thought. Now that the chasms are listed or they're listed in there.
[02:45:56] We've not there listed. They're listed in here all the casualties. What's the name of the guy that
[02:46:01] uh... Yeah, they're not fully listed in here. What's his name uh... wrote the book, the story of
[02:46:06] the story of the battle. What's it? What is it? Anyway, I've got that whole thing.
[02:46:12] They're all listed in here. One's wounded. One's it killed out right. Now this is his book by the
[02:46:22] way right here. See? That's the right here. Here, that book. Sure, what? Okay. Sure,
[02:46:28] right. Okay. No, you know, all of the names are all back here. So here they are. If you
[02:46:33] know, they're all back in here. See this? Got it. See that? So that's where they all are.
[02:46:39] And I talked to him in person and uh... it's getting okay, you know, to quote him.
[02:46:47] And I said, well, I have a little difficulty with uh... with the uh... publisher.
[02:46:52] Mm-hmm. Just don't pay any attention to them. So I'm giving you the okay. All right.
[02:47:01] Now you guys sail to Hawaii. So you go from you go from this hell. How
[02:47:08] longs take you to Hawaii? Like 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks? 20 weeks?
[02:47:13] So then you guys get to Hawaii. You guys are pure side. You're all sitting up there looking
[02:47:18] pure side and a car pulls up and here we go back to the book. Outstept Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,
[02:47:25] Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Air. He's getting to ascend the gangway
[02:47:31] a company by an aide. His friends called him Chet. So did the Marines. The nuclear
[02:47:36] experiences had given them the right. He chet, they shouted. When we go back to the states,
[02:47:42] Chet, we can't wait for the Golden Gate. Does our skipper know the way to day go?
[02:47:47] How about some liberty, Chet? We got to get off this tub and do some Christmas shopping.
[02:47:51] And perhaps most tellingly, hey Admiral, get us someone who knows the reefs for our next landing.
[02:47:59] So that's that's why. And then his driver, then the same...
[02:48:03] Mark said his driver's seat. Oh yeah, you see, you guys you look like some
[02:48:11] Hollywood guy. Yeah, you look like Hollywood guy. So that's Chet's remarks,
[02:48:14] Marty. Yeah, you guys must have been pretty away. But anyway, for sure.
[02:48:18] Hard to control a couple off of taro. So anyway, he was, he was so glad to say these guys here.
[02:48:23] So they're just full of it. Great. That's good. Yeah. And so here we go. Shortly after Nimitz
[02:48:29] departs. The PA announced that the shared would be proceeding directly to the big island.
[02:48:37] In other words, no liberty on a wahoo. This didn't set well with the Marines.
[02:48:41] And they went wild hooting and yelling and whistling, throwing all matter of junk down on the
[02:48:46] dock, pelting the band and the short patrol. The band's been lowered. Their instruments
[02:48:51] and accompanied by the short patrols fled to a nearby shed. The eighth Marines achieve nothing
[02:48:56] with their show of angry emotions, except perhaps to blow off a lot of steam and confirm to all
[02:49:00] concern parties that they should not have been given liberty. The rest was not about the turn.
[02:49:05] These barbarians loose on the civilian populace of a wahoo. The civilized world wasn't ready
[02:49:10] for us. And to be honest, we weren't ready for this. And like, whole life is concerned.
[02:49:13] What, all I've got to do is Japanese. What are you going to do? And there's a lot of Japanese.
[02:49:18] It was just as well. The brass had plans for us. The second division as a whole.
[02:49:21] And these did not involve a return to the United States. First, we would go to the big island
[02:49:27] to rest rebuild and then train for them. And we had to put up the tents.
[02:49:33] There was no face to sleep. So they sent you guys out at the middle of a wahoo.
[02:49:41] No, no, no. This is this is a big island. They sent you out at the middle of it where you
[02:49:45] guys had to establish your own base camp. Oh yeah, yeah. We had to set up the tents and start training.
[02:49:50] Oh, yeah. You get here. You get the stuff out. And then after that, the camp was used by the
[02:50:01] others that eventually took Ewasima. Okay. You say here, you get the camps set up. You get a little
[02:50:09] bit of downtime. And then they get you guys right into training. Our training stress to combine
[02:50:12] norms approach to warfare for veterans of Bayesian and Guadalcanal many aspects of this training
[02:50:18] world. But the replacements in the division we were receiving was receiving almost daily.
[02:50:23] They needed all of it. Replacements are going to be in the Guadalcanalcino area. And we knew
[02:50:29] we were going to use the tanks. And we knew that we were going to have to have communication
[02:50:33] by a phone and the back of the tank. Okay. Yeah, this was a new modification. It was a new
[02:50:38] new home. Yeah, home to the Hadoan maneuver around the strong points at all. You say that most
[02:50:45] of the replacements, most were fresh, fresh teenage, fresh, and so on. Now we're starting to get
[02:50:50] trapped. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you say here. Yeah. Eager kids with no combat experience and no
[02:50:59] idea what they got themselves into. The rest of us just looked at them and shook our heads. We
[02:51:03] did know what they had gotten themselves into. And we wondered how they would survive in the battles
[02:51:07] to come. Never forgetting that our own survival thus far was due in large measure to the vagaries
[02:51:12] of chance and circumstance and maybe just a little bit to the grace of God as well.
[02:51:17] Luck in God's grace, we're desperately slim reads on which to hang our hopes,
[02:51:21] slimmer still for the replacements because they're in experience. We expected that many would die.
[02:51:26] The odds were against them because they had seen no action. But we also expected to die.
[02:51:31] The odds were against us because we had seen too much action. Either way, you did the math.
[02:51:36] It came out bad. Yeah. And it's the war went on for another two years. Yeah, you're a
[02:51:40] hundred percent figure, you know. Yeah. Your chance of security. Yeah. Your percent. Yeah.
[02:51:48] We were, oh, here you talk about the drafties. We were especially skeptical about the
[02:51:52] skeptical about the drafties of which there were significant number. These were selective
[02:51:58] service Marines were something new to which was previously an all-volunteer force, new and unwanted
[02:52:06] and a matter of grave concern for the rest of us. Would the drafties measure up to Marine Corps
[02:52:10] standards? Would we be able to depend on them in battle? We had our doubts. We were wrong to doubt
[02:52:15] them in battle when the chips were down. They proved that like volunteers, they were worthy
[02:52:20] be called Marines. So you eventually take over a as a 60 millimeter mortar section. Yeah, because
[02:52:29] I'm still weak because you're still hurt. Yeah. And so I didn't have to get out and do a lot of
[02:52:33] moving around, you see. And then, again, you cover some of this stuff in good detail on the book,
[02:52:41] but then soon enough, it's your hit and cyber. I learned how to load this ship and
[02:52:47] be a court recorder and all that kind of stuff. Like do these stuff? How long were you guys in Hawaii
[02:52:54] for? Let me think about about six months, five months. Yeah. So you get five, did you get any
[02:53:01] liberty at that time? Oh yeah. Okay, so they let's go. Yeah, we were down a heel a lot. Okay. Yeah.
[02:53:06] Nice. Yeah. All right. So now you get done with that and then boom, morning, 15 June,
[02:53:13] 1944. Shells rained down on our salt waves. This is Sipan. Yeah, but not before we left Hawaii.
[02:53:20] We had our LSTs all lined up, Sipaside. And one of them blew up a mortar shell or something
[02:53:28] that we were doing some welding or something. Anyway, I'm Mercy, I'll blew up. And then
[02:53:33] fires have spread from ship to ship. And we lost, I don't know, maybe could four or four hundred
[02:53:41] men would lost their lives. Yeah. And that whole lineup there. That's it. And then we lost a lot of
[02:53:47] equipment because of that. Did that set back the operation? Yeah, it did. It did put us, yeah.
[02:53:52] Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now that was in a place called Westlock. Yeah. You probably heard about that
[02:53:57] when Hampshire. Yeah, no, and you've got a written, I did. I heard for it about because they
[02:54:00] made changes to the way that they did business with regards to handling. Now this happened,
[02:54:07] this happened when we were at Lenny exercises on Maui. And I think we had some, we had some
[02:54:15] complications at Lenny do that whether something was. And so that was part of it. I, that was part
[02:54:24] of it. But the main thing, they don't know exactly what caused the explosion, but they think
[02:54:28] it probably was. What's what I just mentioned. Yeah. But guys got blew up and just got flying out.
[02:54:36] And one of my friends seems he had happened to him and he was swim, swim, no, he was picked
[02:54:42] up by bolt came by and had it pulled a line. So grab on. And then just drag them over to the beach,
[02:54:50] you know. It's incredible. It's crazy. These vets from Gualdo Canal and Tarowen and then
[02:54:56] de Paris and that was unbelievable. Yeah. But you push it back, I guess. And then you guys had
[02:55:04] this iPad. And here we go, June 15, 1944. Sheels rained down on our sole waves kicking up tall
[02:55:10] columns of water. Now can you imagine landing on side pan? They had all of our cheerrails set
[02:55:16] on the west side of the mountain. Fire over at us. All zeroed in on the reef and along the beach.
[02:55:26] All they had to do was just break back and forth. And we could even show you. And we lost so many
[02:55:33] all of wounded. Our wounded were all going back and then here they got hit by all this archery
[02:55:37] fire. And our pertain, a lot of what pertain commanders were wounded and killed. Because
[02:55:42] there were our main our CPs were wrecked along the beach. And then our ships couldn't fire back
[02:55:51] at them from that angle. They had to go clear around the outside of the island and hit them from
[02:55:55] the river. That's what happened. Yeah. You say here are not only that. They had to spot her
[02:56:02] on a smoke stack and it's sugar refinery. And all that was called in. Just perfect. Perfect. Yeah.
[02:56:12] To my friends were killed right there in the beach. One led to death. Yeah, they're a lot
[02:56:17] other. The same way. Basically it. Yeah. Yeah. This is what Murdoch said about it. Our amtrax
[02:56:27] were in line to breast and we were taking our telefired. The heaviest we ever encountered.
[02:56:31] Yeah. You could see the shells hitting the water exploded. Yeah. Making the water splash way up.
[02:56:36] Just off to my right shell, scored a direct hit on one of my boats and pow, it just went to pieces.
[02:56:41] There was a flash and a big explosion. I could see pieces of men flying out of it. I thought, oh shit.
[02:56:46] But I also thought thank God it wasn't my boat. But I was mostly thinking who was it that got hit
[02:56:52] and how many guys am I going to be without? Man Murdoch was a serious like marine combat leader.
[02:57:01] Yeah. He got there too. Hit there too. And this is this is your this is you say this is your
[02:57:10] experience. When my amtrax reached the reef we were all crouched low below the sides. There was
[02:57:14] too much metal flying around the air to risk popping up for a look around. The guys had their heads
[02:57:19] pulled down between their shoulders and they stared at each other with eyes. We big eyes and said nothing.
[02:57:24] The veterans of Taro had been through this before and were probably having a harder time of it,
[02:57:28] precisely because of their prior experience because they knew how bad things could get.
[02:57:32] The new kids were mostly better off because they didn't have a clue.
[02:57:36] Certainly they were scared but they were also fascinated and awestruck by all the noise and
[02:57:39] commotion and these emotions blunted their fear. Nothing in their experience had prepared for them
[02:57:44] for this. The live fire exercise in Hawaii were puny by comparison and so they did not realize
[02:57:50] that our situation was terrible and likely to get worse. You can be sure that I was scared but
[02:57:55] fortunately I had the concerns of an officer to distract me. What wave were you and what group were
[02:58:03] you in? There was so many with ahead of us on the beach I landed on. We were way on the northern
[02:58:11] end of the landing beach and what happened is the tide of her was forces further way to the left
[02:58:19] and we had to realign a couple hundred yards further back to right again. Now thing is there's
[02:58:28] we didn't have a lot of problem getting into the beach but once we got to the beach there
[02:58:34] was nobody on the beach so they didn't defend themselves at the beach instead it was a heavier
[02:58:42] artillery fire so they landed basically you landed through but where I was we had to cross a
[02:58:49] fighter strip that they had so we had to cross and that was kind of scary going across that
[02:58:54] exposed from people shooting out of the side but then as we maneuvered kept moving to the right
[02:59:02] further to get back where we were supposed to be then the heavy artillery fired just all over
[02:59:08] the place it was just cannon wound him or um yeah you said so many good men were killed that day
[02:59:15] one of them was first lieutenant new old teacher yeah he was a four-year school teacher
[02:59:21] former school teacher you know when I went on one on the I'm never did together a lot in
[02:59:26] New Zealand yeah shell fragment sliced off one of his legs no country be found to help him yeah he
[02:59:32] did it died no other than the same time oh yeah that's his from moral artery pumped the last of his
[02:59:43] blood on to the sand he looked up at those gout around him and whispered get them in off the beach
[02:59:47] yeah yeah yeah because more the fire was coming in we're on the same time John we saw these guns
[02:59:54] by the way when we return up there those guns are still up there two of them are and now it's
[03:00:00] it's a Japanese memorial and that these are part of the memorial up there yeah I I mentioned to you
[03:00:06] that I was just saying I'm too this is right above a physical sandbass city in the city yeah
[03:00:11] right up there I don't know if we I don't know specifically because no I don't know I don't know
[03:00:16] talk of that hill as you get it was a big night above on the top now it'd be just in the
[03:00:21] North towards Shepard shell yeah it's just that that's where the that's where these these are
[03:00:26] this artillery is however and then then down to the left there's the monsters monsters that
[03:00:35] dig out of where they they got the coral the coral gravel or sand to make the airport with
[03:00:43] now that all got filled in with Japanese tanks and and and the amphibian tractors they're all buried
[03:00:49] right in there you probably didn't see it because it's all been buried but I got a picture picture
[03:00:54] I mean one book here I want to look like before they recovered up so I was here when when
[03:01:05] your friend knew was it new no no you said around the same time John Murdach John Murdach was
[03:01:12] running up the beach after disembarking from his amtrak came across Gus Kriger Kriger
[03:01:19] of one of B company's veteran first we tendons in a close friend he's who was lying on the ground
[03:01:24] I've got his picture here yeah his body perforated by shrapnel he was alive but just barely
[03:01:29] John now beside his friend I looked at him to see what I could do for him John recall but he was
[03:01:35] bleeding and so many places I knew I couldn't do anything he wanted to cigarette so I gave him one
[03:01:39] I let that form and I said Gus you'll be okay I got to go I had to go there was too much to
[03:01:46] do I had to get the company organized and I left him there so he died there I've visited his wife
[03:01:52] back afterwards he was later lost within the span of a few minutes John had lost two of his
[03:02:00] season to put two leaders also wounded and put out of action were the second and third battalion
[03:02:04] commanders we tend to crumble Henry P. Jim Crow you heard him and Jim Crow yeah legendary
[03:02:11] he was the former commander of the scout sniper school that you did and also we
[03:02:16] tended John Miller, Lieutenant Colonel John Miller so both the battalion commanders out of
[03:02:22] action yeah from that artillery yeah man yeah you're again you know it looks
[03:02:32] sort of hopeless so that's stage just seeming hopeless here we're catching heavy artillery fire
[03:02:37] and we couldn't do anything about it you know it's it's I like I like bringing up these points in the
[03:02:41] book where you talk about things like this while that's all that's happening you say meanwhile
[03:02:45] I lay in the brush with my man and try to free myself from the despair that suddenly gripped
[03:02:49] me the situation seemed hopeless it was Tarua all over again how I wonder do we gonna get out of
[03:02:55] this mess exactly my feelings at that time and then you say the feelings soon passed I just didn't
[03:03:00] have time for it at my command we moved out everyone rose from their shell holes and craters
[03:03:06] and went forward no hesitation imagine from the bushy strip we lumbered about 10 feet to the
[03:03:11] air strip keep going keep going ahead myself shouting don't stop it's good I like to bring
[03:03:16] those points up because there's several times where you talk about you as a leader have to kind of
[03:03:22] get yourself together and and I think what that's helpful for for is young leaders in the military
[03:03:28] that are gonna feel that same thing if they get into tough situation okay you got to recognize it
[03:03:33] and then you got to take action young 23 year old with all that responsibility I got so then
[03:03:42] next day I got got strapped off my own motors hit hit the leaves up above us and went off
[03:03:55] I didn't report it it just I got entered entered up and there's still air or there goes still there
[03:04:00] I didn't report it yeah you guys are pushing forward and then you guys get kind of a
[03:04:10] a skirmish line and then the Japanese counterattack several points along our line
[03:04:16] Don mains he recalled this they bonds out across the gas dang swamp and we just shot him up
[03:04:21] the swamp was marshy water and you remember it's a physical suicide he likes a
[03:04:25] super I don't remember it's a swampy area and what happened is one of the other officers
[03:04:30] in our battalion he was like a soldier for a type of a guy and he'd been with a pretty
[03:04:36] state army as an ambulance driver and north Africa and we just figured well he's either going to be
[03:04:42] a hero or he's gonna get killed one the other and he got killed what happened was that that
[03:04:47] we were we're at this spot and there are a lot of Japanese on the other side not exposing himself yet
[03:04:53] but he's trying to get it he walked out of head trying to get him and exposing himself he thought
[03:04:58] they were he getting him a surrender and instead this one guy being over had received him
[03:05:04] and strapped his back killed him yeah a lot of guys a lot of casualties and and actually
[03:05:17] at this point there's another casualty and it's a guy by the name of John Murdoch and this story
[03:05:26] is about as good of a story as I've ever heard about the military as a whole so here we go this is
[03:05:34] around this time John Murdoch also became a casualty hit while landing B company hit while
[03:05:40] leading B company on a sweep west of the landing strip down toward Sharan Konoa yeah
[03:05:47] Sharan Konoa and this is so this is John Murdoch now it's called it's really is a
[03:05:54] shalin shalin Konoa they couldn't they couldn't pronounce they couldn't fence their
[03:06:03] are so we call Sharon Konoa so here's John Murdoch talk in fact all of our past signs
[03:06:12] had a lot of wires in her teeth and that's where Roger comes from right yeah like when we say Roger could
[03:06:18] be I was told that that's possible I had thought that it's possible yeah that's the original
[03:06:24] usage was that we knew if someone says Roger you know it was on quite on Guadalcanale Murdoch
[03:06:29] was in there was was taking a piss and here Japanese come come in they don't know if I
[03:06:36] caught sure not is an engineer in one of our interpreters oh you read out a second take I don't
[03:06:44] know how you mentioned that yeah you're about it and here oh yeah oh gosh so here's Murdoch
[03:06:50] talking about him he gets wounded yeah opposition was very light on the other side of the strip
[03:06:56] and when we got down to the end of it we stopped and a Sherman tank came up to help us the tank
[03:07:00] had a phone in the back and I was on the phone and I'm trying to tell the guy inside what
[03:07:03] what I wanted him to shoot at the big smoke stack in the sugar cane factory I figured a
[03:07:08] jab was up there spotting for artillery which was very accurate then all of a sudden boom
[03:07:13] shell started falling all around the tank and I knew the spotter in the smoke stop was telling
[03:07:18] his guns to fire at us so I ordered the tank commander get that smoke stack then I put the phone
[03:07:23] back on and I'm running back to the safety in a hole and that's when I got hit by shrapnel in the
[03:07:27] left leg in the right elbow so I'm sitting there and the corpsman comes over and starts bandaging
[03:07:34] my arm and I look down and I'm down and my pants are all wet and I said holy shit I piss my
[03:07:39] pants and the corpsman said that's not pissed that's blood that's my found out I'd been hitting
[03:07:43] the leg so I dropped my pants and my drawers and now the corpsman's bandaging up my lead
[03:07:48] leg and the jab start to shell us again so I jumped and ran to a nearby hole which wasn't
[03:07:52] easy you know because my pants and my drawers were down around my ankles and so because I haven't
[03:07:58] read the entire book you know you talk about Murdoch and I've mentioned that he was a character
[03:08:03] and you know obviously you mentioned that he liked drink and one of the people he was in
[03:08:07] alcoholic a lot of time he finally got over yeah well one of the people that I would say what's
[03:08:12] that word aided him in being an alcoholic and somebody he apparently become a good friends with
[03:08:17] because it was a Catholic was the Catholic priest father Jo Keehan so they were really good friends
[03:08:23] and they spent a lot of time together and so as as he's starting to move towards being leaving the
[03:08:32] area there's a guy John's executive John's exo Jim Westman appeared on the scene and told and
[03:08:38] John told Westman to take over. He's a Westy congratulations you just made company commander I'm getting
[03:08:44] out of here now Westman got hit by the same arterial that I almost got hit almost got
[03:08:50] covered with and he he was out of the service after that he got badly wounded. Wow and we
[03:08:56] got 50 casualties in Westman was one of I was so so this is Murdoch continuing how it goes from him
[03:09:07] so I head down for the beach looking for the evacuation team I wasn't bleeding all that badly
[03:09:12] but I was a mess I could walk sure and I walked I was looking for one particular doctor
[03:09:17] soul cassal a dentist early your I had seen him on the beach there now I found him and I said
[03:09:23] solos this is fun he's a sound and my friend a ticket please because you couldn't get evacuated
[03:09:28] without a ticket they had to put a ticket on you he looked me over my right hand wasn't any good I
[03:09:33] couldn't use it so solomon ticketed me a little while later I was evacuated in a small boat
[03:09:38] and I said to the navy kid who is driving get hey find me a p.a. 51 will you and he said sure
[03:09:44] we found the ship and by then I was lying down and the guys on the deck called down to me
[03:09:49] will pick you up in a boom on a stretcher and I came up in the basket and I'm all dirty and
[03:09:55] bloody and I see our chaplain father Jo Keehan who I'd become very friendly with so when they took
[03:10:02] me out of the basket and put me on the stretcher on the deck I closed my eyes and attended I was dead
[03:10:08] father Jo Keehan over and started giving me my last bite in the church last right of the church in
[03:10:13] Latin but I can't keep a straight face so I opened my eyes and smiled at him and he goes you son of a
[03:10:19] bitch he goes right from speaking lap Latin to calling me a son of a bitch then he took me down to the
[03:10:24] infirmary and they patched me up a bit then he took me to his state room and put me in his bed I
[03:10:28] must have slept all day and all night I didn't hear a thing I wasn't feeling any pain my night my
[03:10:33] right hand and arm will numb when I came to I didn't know where I was at first then I took a shower
[03:10:38] changed the bandages and got cleaned up that was the end of my war there my second day on side
[03:10:43] pan my right arm was no good really my hand even today is no good yeah here's the thing even
[03:10:49] after it's many quite a snoop there's this summer be done
[03:10:53] it was a million dollar room I don't have any feeling the right side of my hand the nervous
[03:10:59] cutters are million dollar room really because my thumb and two fingers are good still good
[03:11:03] and the next the last finger the little finger we're dead so I thought that was about as good
[03:11:11] of a story as I've ever heard oh character you know you know when he what happened to him there
[03:11:21] when he walked barred into this hotel window and he was drunk as drunk as I'll get out of
[03:11:29] course well anyway the retain commander talked to him then next day about it and he says you know
[03:11:35] you should be more like an officer you shouldn't be doing that then he went on to say then
[03:11:40] the retain commander says well why don't we'll mind and say so I'm kind of like that myself
[03:11:47] you got a whole story about him in the whole one this same retain commander he was killed on
[03:11:51] Bogumville as he landed they call them they called him well he he took over the one of the
[03:12:02] what he called it one of the the Chinese way column yeah name right there in name form like the
[03:12:07] equivalent of the of the in in England the equivalent of it and what I don't know I don't know
[03:12:17] was an important you know that kind of like the like the uh recoluses but no no no no no no no no no no
[03:12:23] there be unit that would be the ones that just like you a seal say a raider a raider he took over the
[03:12:30] raider battalion that landed on Bogumville okay and he was killed there and then his his comments
[03:12:36] were as he died so well it's been a short war for me well well you there's actually another another one
[03:12:49] of these big situations that happens where there's a battle at sea oh yeah Philpincy yeah
[03:12:57] and Maryana's turkey shoot yeah you know that it's coming you'd see this before and he said
[03:13:03] we were right a few days later we learned that a great battle had indeed been fought in the waters off
[03:13:07] west of siphon something in the decisive victory for the US yeah well yeah with their defeat in the
[03:13:12] battle of the Philpincy the Japanese lost all hope of re-releaving their forces on siphon now was up to
[03:13:19] us the marines knee army to win the land battle do we call do I call it the mariana's turkey shoot
[03:13:25] yeah I did right there okay I don't think you've used those words well okay that's that's
[03:13:29] traditionally what it's called yeah that is that's the same one now that's the reason that this guy
[03:13:37] he held on because he thought the navy could come back and take it back now because he surrendered
[03:13:44] even after the war he was not promoted to major in a terrible and and the other thing was even
[03:13:53] the other other officer that I visited the same time that had fired at us from business artillery
[03:14:00] in Guadalcanel named by name a tannihaki otannih he bad mouth is this guy says well he should have
[03:14:07] even committed here he's even now he's a third side he's gonna be even he's still yeah oh yeah
[03:14:16] now you guys are kind of pressing through the rest of the island you say here my mortar
[03:14:26] section was always about 200 yards behind our lead elements and outbreak of small arms
[03:14:30] firing front of us was a single stop and set up our weapons you see now in the in that
[03:14:37] that movie about Pacific now you mean the the series the Pacific series yeah here here they had a
[03:14:45] six-million meter per his right up in the front and I don't know why the advisor does hey you don't do
[03:14:49] that yeah it doesn't make any sense and also all script is all screwed up it was all about a guy
[03:14:57] that was going through a going through some kind of a psychological thing and hurry's talking he's talking
[03:15:03] to the the kernel in charge of the of the of the of the hospital that he's at you know that
[03:15:11] you're talking to the carman you know stuff like that yeah well Hollywood they don't always
[03:15:17] terrible because you know they have to in the real world everything goes spread out so you
[03:15:23] know that they take a picture so they they they take a picture some real concentrating you see
[03:15:29] it's not like that at all yeah still one of my favorite uh war movies the Pacific yeah
[03:15:36] what did you think of it well this this sets for incredible they were incredible I
[03:15:43] I like friends this I I've been to Palo and good wonderful wonderful wonderful set yeah the
[03:15:52] and let's see what was it there what was the other place they were they did Guadalcanale
[03:16:00] so one Guadalcanale yeah well all the landings were they were great yeah they were great
[03:16:07] was that one I was you know yeah that what I thought I did it cover each size those two
[03:16:14] okay I'm thinking primarily I wanted Palo to like yes yeah yeah yeah I just the first time I ever
[03:16:21] watched it I was riding on a airplane I had it on my computer I had a headphone's in I was watching
[03:16:27] it really close and I I thought that the tone of the script is horrible oh the script might be
[03:16:33] horrible out the combat scenes for me they were unbelievable unbelievable the any actually
[03:16:38] we have your book I was I was saying while they did a great job because one thing that I
[03:16:42] was said to myself you know it's you know when some of the fire fights the night fire fights
[03:16:48] it's just flashes and they're like oh yeah that's what it's like there you go and you capture
[03:16:52] it in your book you can't really tell what's going on but it's bad yeah and they did a great job
[03:16:57] of capturing that hopefully this nail die who we'll pick up on this yeah you'll see the potential there
[03:17:05] hopefully you will see
[03:17:13] so now you guys are as you guys are pushing through you say casualties overall were relatively light
[03:17:18] yes they were at that time well thing is you know this ran for almost a month so yeah I
[03:17:25] just dragged out but the casualties were kept coming in of course yeah and then you say meanwhile
[03:17:31] off to a right in the other side of the mountain the 27th Division had run into a meet grind
[03:17:34] of these areas attacking on a plateau a plateau border on its left by a sheer cliff that formed
[03:17:39] the east face of the mountain called purple herds yeah and they were held up and so
[03:17:48] Alameda Smith he just he got rid of their their general and the army and National Guard troops
[03:17:56] they they they they never really got over it that was unfair they shouldn't have done that
[03:18:01] well I they did run if some terrible things down there were catching from the flank you know
[03:18:05] true bad yeah and here I was up I was up way in and further and I could look down I see what they're up against
[03:18:14] here speaking of friendly forces or friendly fire incidents here you were I was resting on one
[03:18:20] knee next to a tree holding my carbine upright where you go up plate to the ground when suddenly
[03:18:25] wham wham wham three big shells explode over a hundred to five millimeter long-term long-times
[03:18:31] long range the shells cannot from Japanese artillery but from a battery of armored tanks didn't
[03:18:38] believe that we were that far forward so he did it I found out like the western man told me about it
[03:18:45] he's the one that called it in short he and it was horrible oh it was devastating oh my
[03:18:52] guys so so many guys were just pulverized we didn't know what it hit us most of us did not hear the
[03:18:56] shells coming no one's out of nowhere no one ducked for cover no one of the shells burst in the
[03:19:01] tree above me deflecting the force of the blast and most of the strappin' outwards and set a
[03:19:05] straight down that's my life a single piece of metal pierced my elbow the wound whose larger than
[03:19:10] a bullet hole about an ancient dinammer at hurt like hell but it didn't look serious it hardly
[03:19:15] blood and the bone didn't seem damaged it's still the wound needed treatment a few minutes later
[03:19:21] several hospital jeeps converged on the scene and I talked over one of them on the way just 50 yards
[03:19:26] from me I passed a large creator containing the remains of several men from weapons platoon who
[03:19:30] been playing blackjack when the shell hit their position they'd little bit literally been blown
[03:19:35] to bits several of those men had been my friends in Samoa I'd served in their unit before
[03:19:41] being commissioned I could identify only one of them and because he was glasses yeah yeah
[03:19:47] a few of the name was costinson a fact I have a picture of him too somewhere here
[03:19:54] a few yards further on a dead marine lay in a hole beneath a coral outcropping where I had
[03:20:00] spent the previous night he'd been killed by the army's misdirected salvo the same shell
[03:20:06] the killer yeah you want yeah the same shell that killed the blackjack players wound a dick
[03:20:11] stine then a member of weapons platoon he doesn't remember the explosion or anything else about
[03:20:16] the day one moment I'm standing on the ground with the guys in the weapons platoon and the next
[03:20:19] thing and I know I'm waking up in a tent there in the fuel hospital and it's around midnight
[03:20:23] just a concussion in this case he just how long am I here so he just takes off
[03:20:31] he's could still be alive I think he's he's in a rest of now I think
[03:20:36] all in all the shells from the 150s fives killed or wounded more than 50 marines
[03:20:42] yeah yeah yeah now the fellow wrote the wrote a book we came to win or we are be killed or
[03:20:49] did die and he got hit he retired as a Colonel by the way and anyway he got hit by the same
[03:20:57] same rounds and then put him out he got he got medical medical discipline uh retirement
[03:21:06] devasting no no no no no that he had one of his pretty close to friends
[03:21:12] turns out he was my company commander at at this particular time and uh the cell server they
[03:21:18] was cell server he'd been a professional dancer and he got he got hit by by a large round
[03:21:25] on on on on uh tenion and then I then I took over took over I was at exact took over and
[03:21:32] he went he went to the hospital in Guadalcanal he killed himself because he did want to live
[03:21:39] without a one leg because he's professional dancer and I know I don't think that this fellow wrote
[03:21:47] the book realized he he he writes in the book he was the spun it he didn't rent he didn't never
[03:21:52] mention he killed himself I talked to the guy that wrote the book he didn't really know one
[03:21:56] yet others well he did I know what a coincidence I dated a gal one time she was a she was a
[03:22:05] receptionist for William Morris agency and they they represent a lot of the big people
[03:22:11] then it turned around all of those well anyway uh she uh I was invited to their Christmas party
[03:22:20] and this was in 44 William Morris agency and as they came in she told me who was so on
[03:22:27] money will be and so on is he all came in and then I ended up a day to do a couple of times and one time
[03:22:34] uh we were in this uh this big place well no place can't think of name now but anyway
[03:22:41] others had just returned it's about a month after I had from from Memorionis and I said how did
[03:22:47] he how did son son make out and they said oh you didn't know he killed himself my girlfriend
[03:22:55] says I knew that we were close fans of his family we used to play brist together
[03:23:00] and a small world that's crazy yeah that's crazy yeah so at this point you're wounded yeah yeah
[03:23:12] and you go back to the aid station yeah and then late on the 7th of July my 3rd day in the
[03:23:19] field hospital doctors and corpsman went through the words towards telling all the walking
[03:23:23] to remember to the units because we had to lock up and they were about to the Japanese
[03:23:29] and the guns I had to have a still thousands of their hiding ready ready to kill themselves
[03:23:36] or make one last bunch of charge and her I had walked right through her 40 were killed
[03:23:45] that that that the last night of the mop up can you imagine and then this guy
[03:23:51] he was in these were his men and when I I found out his track his track and my track
[03:24:02] crossed okay I found out on that and so when I once stood I wanted to talk to him sure enough
[03:24:07] she's yeah I was there some reason I wasn't saying bonds on all that no that was another guy
[03:24:14] so here and then then he and then then the guy wrote a book about him I have the copy of the book
[03:24:19] it's called the last the last samurai by by Jones and I helped I helped the reviewer of the book
[03:24:26] before he published it well so uh ended up uh he was invited by the author to attend our reunion in Florida
[03:24:42] and when he came he and his wife came and some of our guys treated him materially they could not
[03:24:48] believe this guy could have done what he did as far as given him such a bad time being up there
[03:24:54] right up until after the war and I tried to I tried to call things down and I had to hit
[03:24:58] the time there's an article there's an article look at this article I hear tell the about it
[03:25:02] look at this article think I have it in here I think no I guess I don't have it here I never think
[03:25:11] yeah here's article I know oh I guess I don't have the way man no that's not yet he's a darn it
[03:25:24] by the way here's a picture this guy I showed you that there's a picture this guy that I'm
[03:25:28] interviewing this is the other guy that fired his known as pistol peat he's one that did
[03:25:33] most of the shooting at us at 105 long range rifle yeah for him and two and one was on
[03:25:43] Guadalcanale we we went to it that's I have a picture in my book with him standing at it and
[03:25:50] he became a major his his father had been a general in at a kind of like our like west point
[03:26:01] but for senior officers to come to and one of these officers was the prince he was a
[03:26:08] tenant general became a lieutenant general and he was one of the one standing on a Missouri
[03:26:14] at this room that was the one of his students his father's students amazing huh yeah
[03:26:23] and by the way this is what the bonds are look like here you see that here we're we buried those bodies
[03:26:28] we dragged them into the ditch and we buried probably 4,000 bodies like that
[03:26:34] well and now they're homes all through here yeah for so they're still there they're still
[03:26:40] they're only about four feet down and then then there's then there's a beautiful new hotels right
[03:26:47] on the beach just across the road from that and you were probably told about that when you were
[03:26:52] there I don't know it's a place called place called tannipay I don't know tannipay and also
[03:26:58] place called sandrokey yeah so for people that are just listening these are just images of
[03:27:05] this this massive attack it happened was we we fired in our live in three is our tour
[03:27:13] we fired in at them as they were charging and so their bodies are all chuda all chuda
[03:27:21] you go into some pretty good detail about the about that bonds I had to talk about this
[03:27:26] about the age band and radio that is a best you'll find anywhere and in fact
[03:27:33] that's where you know I had to reveal it in detail because I had some doubt about it and I said
[03:27:38] well it looks like in general he's okay he's he's said it right there's nobody else can talk about
[03:27:43] it's in that detail don't but he can then oh it's a great idea oh first hand yeah
[03:27:49] now I did go to a reunion of those people in that battalion back in Iowa and so this guy was
[03:27:57] there and he was one of the ones that the interview of course for this yeah and then yeah so
[03:28:04] if you want to do some account of just incredible fortitude you got to read this book and
[03:28:11] then it picks up where you what you were just talking about this is when you go now to do sort of the
[03:28:20] sort of a cleanup and you see this many of the bodies were recognizable yeah and
[03:28:29] one of the guys Sandy and the others had to reach the bloody remains for dog tags that would
[03:28:34] identify their friends discovering which one of their friends they were charging and hunger
[03:28:39] if I own people were killed most of them soldiers they went right through them you say that this
[03:28:45] bonsai this bonsai resulted in as near as I can determine from what I saw and what I've read
[03:28:51] the Japanese lost upward of 4,000 men some 500 Americans were killed most of them from the army
[03:28:57] the two battalions that were overrun and nearly wiped out each battery suffered 150 two
[03:29:02] casualties in the attack 75 killed or 6 wounded they got completely your run
[03:29:07] it's estimated that some 600 Japanese were killed on the open ground directly in front of the
[03:29:12] batteries guns yeah yeah man you're you were pushing up again this is another another thing
[03:29:23] that you passed through we passed through their positions and deployed to skirmish lines
[03:29:27] extending the water's edge in the railroad tracks of 6 buildings advancing along the
[03:29:32] along the shore in the eighth of longer road yeah thus a raid we picked our way
[03:29:37] slowly through the battle zone our weapons at the ready all around the dead were thick on the
[03:29:42] ground in numbers that defied comprehension bodies and pieces of bodies everywhere artillery
[03:29:47] and pounded the area and chopped up the bodies turning the battlefield into an immense open air
[03:29:52] abitwar strewn with torsos and limbs and heads and chunks of unadunifiable flesh burned black
[03:29:58] by fire I could recreate the flow I could recreate the flow and ferocity the battle the
[03:30:03] patterns of the fight and flight by the numbers and positioning of the dead there would be places
[03:30:08] pockets of resistance where bodies were pile on top of bodies dead Japanese entangled with
[03:30:12] that americans frozen in attitudes of hand to hand combat clutching each other plunging
[03:30:18] bay nets into each other locked in their death struggles arm machine gun positions were
[03:30:22] tabloids of butchery with bodies of the Japanese heaped in front of positions and bodies of
[03:30:27] american soldiers slumped over their guns for men who didn't want to be there the US army soldiers
[03:30:32] they were a lot of drafts and all of a bunch of drafts here too yeah not all the Japanese were
[03:30:38] dead of course as usual some were shaming yeah we knew this would be the case and we very quickly
[03:30:43] and we're very quick on our triggers if we saw any movement if one of those bodies so much
[03:30:47] is twitch we poor fire we'd poor fire into it even if we didn't see movement if a body or group
[03:30:52] of bodies looks suspicious we shot it through and through bushes big enough to provide concealment
[03:30:57] were preemptively blasted into wood chips and leaf bits now and then as we advance across the
[03:31:03] battlefield the dead body rose suddenly to throw a grenade or shoot it us some Japanese jumped
[03:31:08] to their feet and tried to run away we shot them all just shot them all right down no prisoners
[03:31:14] were taken we moved forward at a steady pace hardly breaking a stride rarely halting we just kept
[03:31:19] walking through the killing ground looking around scrutinizing the bodies firing at the Japanese
[03:31:24] are coming to a probably under dead probably at least a hundred and we we we we had only
[03:31:30] a couple of wounded as well we had that process yeah that was a large of stuff the war
[03:31:41] that was what that was a large of sponsi counter attack of the war see if they were given
[03:31:47] no objective to just keep going keep going it gives many of us as possible until they're
[03:31:53] in the end of the house lost their life and and the two two commanders they they
[03:31:59] committed very carry before started and one was the one the gumo was the one the lead to attack
[03:32:04] on Pearl Harbor now gumo and then we finally get to the last campaign a little a little
[03:32:16] over three miles south of siphon sent tinian twelve miles long six miles across it's widest point
[03:32:23] and this was your oh this is really something too that first night
[03:32:34] one eight landed late that afternoon yeah the second division unit involved the only the only
[03:32:40] second division unit involved the jday operations the regiment quickly established a reserve
[03:32:44] position behind the beach has perimeter digging in and string barbed wire and anticipation
[03:32:48] of enemy counter attack all moving around the perimeter. All of it's 200 miles 200 to 100 foot
[03:32:54] to 200 yards wide beach they had no idea they were going to be up there they thought we
[03:33:00] got land down down there the main town which was called a well-known called san Jose
[03:33:05] you guys fainted you could there's a fake we did a fake but we had a battle shed hip hit
[03:33:10] it was a lot of damage and lost lies from counter counter fire counter battery fire.
[03:33:15] This was for me and many other second division marines the fourth combat operation in just 18
[03:33:20] months the three previous guadal canal tarua and siphon had all been difficult each in its own way
[03:33:26] taking enormous physical and emotional toll on all the survivors most of us have been wounded at
[03:33:31] least once all of us have been sick. Now somewhere we're you're going to get to the point where
[03:33:38] we had to at night go over and head off the Japanese that we're attacking our artillery and
[03:33:46] they're we're you know you don't know and I'll tell you about it if you don't see yeah yeah
[03:33:53] the thing that's interesting about this is I mean just you guys having been through
[03:34:00] everything that you'd been through at this point I mean the mentality going into this you know
[03:34:05] you say here the air force could have dropped bushels of purple hearts on our front line units
[03:34:09] and every marine who grabbed on what had deserved it. Okay now they're talking the
[03:34:13] napal was dropped the first time to war on on tinian probably before we landed.
[03:34:20] Yeah you said you said then the aircraft used napal bombs something you do us we
[03:34:24] watching amazement as the bombs fell earth were tumbling and over and an exploded on a ridge
[03:34:29] that instantly erupted in flames and oily smoke along its entire length about 10 seconds later
[03:34:34] gust of hot air from the ledge blew us over. Next day first batiny elements moved up on the
[03:34:39] ridge and poked around the scorched landscape most of the undergrowth had been burned away.
[03:34:44] The ground was black and reaped of gasoline and the foxholes were filled with the corpses of
[03:34:48] Japanese soldiers blackened and shriveled by the incinerating fires. Yeah first use in napal?
[03:34:57] What was the other section that you were talking about? Okay right I'll tell you in the
[03:35:01] day the island of secure. August 2nd here I'm a company commander. We reached the next the last
[03:35:12] bit the beach you know looking down over the cliff and when that one we returned there when
[03:35:18] they're in March of this year we looked from the south side of that beach where the civilians
[03:35:26] all jumped and killed themselves and looked up across and my company was spread from about halfway
[03:35:34] up to clear to that point and we had we had we had both go out with a bullhorn to form the surrender
[03:35:42] and gave them all the made of they didn't so then we fired them machine guns and martyrs at them
[03:35:47] and they all jumped off off the point this side of it and hunters jumped off their des.
[03:35:54] And then that night we were spread out so long so so thinly we decided I'll talk to my
[03:36:03] my company exactly that time and what's we do at long and so you're just going to have to have
[03:36:08] strong points figure where they're likely to come through. So we did and we looked out they tried to
[03:36:12] come through right a strong point so we'll let but anyway these the then we had to send people down
[03:36:23] and try to get them out of the caves down below us there are a lot of civilians in there.
[03:36:29] So were the civilians out where they were they staying with the with the with the with the
[03:36:32] no they're by themselves families. Yeah the were families one not to run there they're
[03:36:36] even the same cave some soldiers were them yeah yeah and eventually you could say here the
[03:36:43] Japanese I mean and again this we're jumping through all kinds of you know just crazy combat
[03:36:50] and then you get to a point where the Japanese had no no more fight left of them they were ready to die
[03:36:57] if not yet call it quits for the most part they went on. Okay then what happened you see when
[03:37:01] I when I told you right after we landed the first night and here we got here we got we got
[03:37:06] we got got a message that our artillery was being being overrun by our other Japanese and so we
[03:37:14] had here's that for dark and probably around midnight and here we here as a tiny I was a
[03:37:20] company exact and I took up 200 or maybe two Patoons and we went single file to former sliders
[03:37:29] from the front of the artillery well that's great dangers because anybody walking around is
[03:37:35] going to get going to get the enemy you know right well then I went when morning came here there were
[03:37:41] all kinds of shovels out there and there was Japanese and here we had the our line of scrimmers
[03:37:48] had to go forward oh this is going to be horrible the air in fox though they're in holes and we're
[03:37:53] not not a lawnmower shot at us as we came up very close with an less than 100 feet or so I
[03:38:02] just put a hand grenade shoot kill themselves bang bang 100 and kill themselves as we walk forward
[03:38:08] and we only had a couple of men wounded so we had and why they didn't shoot back I don't understand
[03:38:15] we're in all of them were given orders not to thank you in the air hurry wow
[03:38:22] what a relief what a relief so going back to the book here and again I'm jumping through
[03:38:29] some incredible stories but Tinian was declared secure on one August first Patan pulled back
[03:38:36] about a mile from the coast and set up camp the end of the fighting was very abrupt suddenly we didn't
[03:38:41] have anything to do there was no enemy activity in the immediate area no danger no shooting I just
[03:38:46] sat back and tried to enjoy the situation that this wasn't as easy as you might think I was exhausted
[03:38:51] and filled with a lingering dread a sense that I'd used up all my lives I had I had been
[03:38:57] become conditioned to wondering whether I was going to survive another day and then all of a sudden
[03:39:01] all the causes for concern had vanished as though I had been given a reprieve from a death sentence
[03:39:07] I could hardly believe it a strange feeling I didn't have long to dwell on it a few days later
[03:39:11] I received orders to return to the states 32 months after leaving San Diego I was going home
[03:39:21] three weeks later at Pearl Harbor where I'd been marking time in the transit center I'd
[03:39:26] boarded a giant Martin Mars flying boat for the final leg of the flight that was oh my gosh
[03:39:33] well landed in Patan when he called that place I can't think we're now in Berkeley
[03:39:39] what is it like? Alameda Alameda Alameda Alameda Naval Air Station
[03:39:44] everyone on board service men from every branch returning home watching outer silence as the golden
[03:39:48] gate bridge passed beneath I reported to a marine facility was granted 32 day furlough one for every month of
[03:39:55] overseas duty later that day I visited a barber shop while I was sitting in the chair one of the
[03:40:01] patrons began bitching about the terrible state of things in the country I listened to him for a while
[03:40:05] and then I exploded you don't know what terrible is I told him he shut up after that
[03:40:11] you know talk about the woman ran to the what the woman ran into oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:40:15] yes the best I picked up that was your first time in the female marine yeah yeah and you know
[03:40:20] because they brought the women in now they could form a six division but taking all them in
[03:40:28] they had clerical type of work take them out put them in combat right this is the thing that's crazy
[03:40:35] for me to think about here is you know you just have one line it says the war wasn't over right
[03:40:40] and this is 1944 the war wasn't over and as you talked about earlier the thought was that
[03:40:46] you know America was gonna have to invade every island until you got right into Tokyo and since you
[03:40:53] had seen the the how how steadfast the Japanese were you all just thought yeah I might be home for
[03:41:00] year but I'll be back over there as a as a battalion executive officer and a battalion officer or
[03:41:05] whatever you know all my friends that came back and they they ended back up
[03:41:09] keeping preparing preparing for that so about a year you spend at Kwanico at the basics school
[03:41:17] teaching the young marine that and and the first what called PCS tuned commander school
[03:41:22] I went through the first as a captain and then I went through orientation crashed
[03:41:27] because I became an instructor you see okay so they sent you through a school
[03:41:31] they sent you to a commander even though you'd already been a company commander in combat yeah yeah yeah
[03:41:35] so anyway I don't know the academics of it basically and well and then now it's a
[03:41:42] commander then the next I'm a commander the at the basic school and here I have a
[03:41:48] battalion of a second of tennis just recent graduates in naval academy and a battalion senior
[03:41:56] NCOs and none of them wanted to continue they just wanted to retire at their rank you know
[03:42:03] you're going to be back to a second lieutenant and I never forget when the first things I had to do
[03:42:09] was keep my little extra on formal guard mouth and I never been the formal guard and I told them
[03:42:16] I told these guys I said I never I've been a combat almost as time and I've been a formal guard mouth
[03:42:22] since I I had a felt presentation to move it felled around you know they didn't give me a bad
[03:42:28] time they'd all they'd all been through it you know but I never never had been through it you know
[03:42:33] and I told them major about it and said he told me said you figured out you figured out
[03:42:40] no
[03:42:42] here we go on August 15th after night of devastating bonding raids bombing raids on eight
[03:42:47] Japanese cities the Japanese announced their intention for surrender yeah
[03:42:50] for Americans and most of the and this is after obviously the bomb yeah you know
[03:42:54] um for Americans and the rest of the world the announcement signaled the end of World War two
[03:43:00] even though the formal surrender didn't take place until the second second of September
[03:43:05] a few weeks later our classes were terminated in orders were cut by thousands to release
[03:43:09] men from active duty I was asked whether I wanted to stay on and take a regular commission in
[03:43:14] the Marine Corps I was tempted I'd started as a private made it all the way up to Captain at age
[03:43:19] 24 no small achievement and then was the potential for further advancement in the postwar corps
[03:43:24] at first I said yes and signed my the requisite papers but after sleeping on I changed my mind
[03:43:30] the next day I would do my papers shortly thereafter I was released from active duty
[03:43:33] I bought a 1940 crisis or convertible yeah and an octobre hydrovocross country to spook a
[03:43:39] yeah yeah five day journey yeah and then then I went to work at the H1th of college
[03:43:47] I went to work for North American aviation and there was there for six years
[03:43:52] and then lucky there was there for 23 years and I was on primarily on the exploration space you
[03:44:02] know I was involved with the first the first flights to Mars and the first fly by
[03:44:08] it was a failure we provided the vehicle that did the injection took it to it and it was going to
[03:44:15] as it flow by and then take pictures of it's blue by and also provided the shroud that protected it
[03:44:21] get now the atmosphere well the shroud outcast and blew up and here I had to take a technician
[03:44:28] down to JPL who would provide the spacecraft and and then then that had to take down a half was
[03:44:34] shroud and they put it in temperature out of two chamber it did blow up and I had to go back and tell
[03:44:41] our engineering people hey it did blow up and this all no it couldn't there's just they just
[03:44:48] convinced you did no it did blow up so then we had to work like the next the next launch
[03:44:55] next launch window was just matter a couple months later so we built a different kind of
[03:44:59] different construction and it made it from then on I was involved and all kinds of involved
[03:45:05] with with the with the tech pictures of the moon where they uh Boeing provided space
[03:45:11] to get we provided the means of getting there and then astronauts when they prepared to land
[03:45:16] the moon will they their practice meeting with our spacecraft that kind of stuff yeah and one time
[03:45:23] one time and then I became the I became the president of the management association about 3000
[03:45:29] members and one time we had we had uh put this name uh the first on the moon um Armstrong Neil Armstrong
[03:45:39] he spoke to us and I asked him a question we had about seven hundred people in our tennis
[03:45:44] and he asked him a question and says sometimes you look up there at nighttime and he has to kind
[03:45:49] of pinch yourself I was really there can you imagine can you imagine what his answer was
[03:45:54] I have no idea his answer was I've learned to live with it
[03:46:00] and just brought down the house oh she and then what you when did you get married when you have kids
[03:46:05] uh that was in uh just a minute 40 47 yeah and uh I mean this this book is just like I said
[03:46:27] I've read a fraction of it probably read less than 10% of it tonight the the amount of
[03:46:33] information the amount of detail the stories are just okay now this is unbelievable this is
[03:46:38] when you get that one and it's entirely different this is based on interviews by a very
[03:46:44] and this is based on some talking to people but mostly I'm talking to the natives I'm talking
[03:46:51] to Japanese uh I'm describing what what it's like now what the landscape is like all in the
[03:46:58] pre-lying around so it's almost like this book should have been written first and should have been written second
[03:47:03] well I don't know you see see the thing is this is too broad or is this is getting
[03:47:07] not detailed and detailed with the people yeah and that's mentioned in in the in the
[03:47:13] in the prologue or the forward in the forward in the forward that's where it's mentioned that's
[03:47:17] reason it's a different entirely different and I didn't even tend to write this but uh you got
[03:47:23] you know here hit all of these all these tapes and now only that and a little little little
[03:47:29] tape recorder and the one's Japanese are in two acute and he was doing the same thing so
[03:47:33] anything I said he was recording or I'm saying so on and so that's when it said okay that was
[03:47:39] 82 then 85 183 a tickle group out as a tour guide then 85 I went I went to japan went on
[03:47:47] space A and so here I entered you and that was that was really interesting I'll tell you this guy
[03:47:54] this guy Tani he told me all or the space we've had yassikuni shrine and the you know the
[03:48:01] in person if he had less than all that kind of stuff and just a lot and then went into a
[03:48:08] a TV studio and all that kind of stuff is incredible and any any point or doubt you know
[03:48:14] I think it was so fire bomb you know it all this is all new all new but then everyone is so friendly
[03:48:21] to me you know just couldn't believe it yeah then he built he built a he built a you know a battleship
[03:48:28] that was the Japanese battleship that had it's shilled Guadalcanale he made it and it would
[03:48:36] it was radio controlled and it would fly even it would fire from the guns with a photo flash flash out
[03:48:43] and he had in his garage and his eight foot long is the same size is the actual drawings of the

[03:49:56] all I did was hey yeah this is correct yeah yeah oh well there's more of this there's a little
[03:50:02] more here and there's not the main the main was on site pan I just I had some doubts because
[03:50:09] he had he did believe in some conspiracy theories about other things that's reason I was concerned
[03:50:14] but overall it was okay it was good well it's like I said it's an incredible book to read I
[03:50:20] know I've had you here for just about four hours talking but I wanted to I wanted to kind of close
[03:50:26] it out with one last thing one last section of the book and you already kind of mentioned it a
[03:50:30] little bit but the way it's written is just just such a fitting close to this is not the guy
[03:50:36] that's the life yeah and so it says this on October on on 22 November 1993 the 50th anniversary
[03:50:45] of the bout for Taroa I tended this ceremony in yorkers New York to be dedicate here you go
[03:50:51] Anthony O'Boyle Memorial Park in the name of the fallen private from my pontoon he was well known
[03:50:57] there in that town also attending where Anthony's good friends and foxhole buddies yeah
[03:51:03] Bill Crumpacker said it right yeah he was with a dickstein yeah our company commander John Merck
[03:51:10] and several other Taroa vet as well as a member as a number of high-ranking Marines
[03:51:18] including Lieutenant John General John J. She hand he bought a herd of a man Jeff yeah
[03:51:23] then a member of the joint chiefs of staff yeah it was a cold gray day with an icy wind blowing
[03:51:29] off the Hudson River yeah quite a contrast to the tropical heat and brilliant sunlight on
[03:51:34] Bezier when Anthony had medicine and yeah shot in the head while peering over the sea wall
[03:51:40] and red beach too Anthony had fallen back into John Murdoch's arms still alive but unconscious
[03:51:46] his body twitching his eyes open but empty John held him for a brief time spoke to him
[03:51:53] and then set him aside on the beach among the bodies of other slain Marines where he died a
[03:51:59] few minutes later all the solemn knees appropriate to the occasion where observed all the
[03:52:06] rights were performed the colors were trouped speeches were giving music was played prayers were offered
[03:52:16] we saying the national anthem the Marine him and amazing grace there was a presentation of
[03:52:23] military testimonials proclamations were made John Murdoch gave a talk about Anthony
[03:52:30] then presented Anthony's brother with the purple heart a fitting gesture from a man who comforted
[03:52:36] Anthony in his final moments of his life and honor guard fired at 21 gun salute
[03:52:43] taps was played we all wept our tears were shed in both sorrow and joy
[03:52:51] there was cause for both Anthony's life had been short his dying heart his glory
[03:53:00] everlasting there was no bitterness no disillusionment no anger his life had mattered
[03:53:10] his death also and we remembered both and knew that both had meaning and purpose the biographical
[03:53:22] sketch in the program for the ceremony expressed the feelings well in this regard
[03:53:27] and serves as a fitting epitaph for every marine in the second world war
[03:53:33] and here's what it read if the world had been different if he had been born at another time
[03:53:44] Anthony with his sunshine smile could have married raised a family had grandchildren
[03:53:51] and lived a quiet typically traditional American life but the early 1940s were not normal times
[03:54:00] a fascist dictator threatened to conquer Europe and forge an alliance with the militarists
[03:54:07] who controlled the Japanese government and they're distorted plan for world domination
[03:54:13] and unprepared and unsuspecting United States became a primary target the American people were
[03:54:19] shocked in the action by the Sunday morning arrival of Japanese bombers over a wahoo
[03:54:25] like hundreds of thousands of other young Americans Anthony felt compelled to volunteer
[03:54:32] to serve his country he simply could not stand aside while America was under attack
[03:54:40] Anthony gave his life on tarua for his country his core and for his fellow Marines
[03:54:48] he was not a famous hero more than a by millions extolled in the press
[03:54:53] immortalized in magazine articles or books he was no one special just another marine private first class
[03:55:05] the American people should thank god eternally for Anthony and his fellow Marines soldiers
[03:55:14] see men and airmen who preserved and won a magnificent victory over a wickedly evil enemy
[03:55:24] semper five brother you are not forgotten and with that Dean Lad has left the building
[03:55:36] and actually who has joined us in the building looks like Jason Gargert, Jason Gargert's randomly
[03:55:41] we are in spokane Washington spokane spokane spokane and since you originally linked me up with
[03:55:52] the Dean Lad on a few random flights somewhere and you saw what was he just wearing like a
[03:55:58] Marine Corps hat sure is one of the Marine Corps hats sitting there and I struck up a conversation
[03:56:03] with them and the next thing you know he's like oh I was like wow what can I tell you
[03:56:07] taro up and I was like holy cow and he goes out and wrote a book about it you don't have to be kidding me
[03:56:11] it was awesome just so funny you text from the flight yeah and that you get so funny because
[03:56:16] you and I were just standing out there talking to him you know how you get you know you and I are
[03:56:19] used to hear in all of our friends say like oh well now it was in Baghdad or when I was in Marsha
[03:56:25] or when I was in wherever I was in Ramadi and we were just standing out there and he's like
[03:56:29] well you know when I was in side pan I was like that's so much better so much cooler than we are
[03:56:36] dang it and that is the most ridiculous what those guys went through is completely ridiculous
[03:56:43] and I know I mean I've since you know with the old breed is kind of the the the the way that I learned
[03:56:53] like what those guys went through sledge Eugene sledge but this book is just right out right
[03:56:59] there with it man it's right there with it and you're just getting gut shot while you're 500
[03:57:07] meters from the beach at tarua yep you there's no way you're gonna live and yet you live and then
[03:57:14] and then guess what you go to Hawaii for six months and then you're hitting the beaches of
[03:57:20] side pan and then you barely survive that and then guess what you're hitting the beaches of
[03:57:25] tinian and by the way all of this is after you were at the wild canal crazy it's completely insane
[03:57:31] and by the way when he got back he got back in 40 August of 44 when he gets back he has like 32 days
[03:57:39] leave one day for every month that he was overseas and then he's like none of those guys thought
[03:57:47] the war was gonna end they just got done literally killing every single Japanese except for 17 on an
[03:57:54] island they all fought to the death and then they think okay there's however many millions left in
[03:58:00] Japan yeah we're gonna have to go kill them all we're gonna have to kill every single one of those people
[03:58:05] that's what they were thinking so he was thinking cool I'm gonna be on short duty back here training
[03:58:09] Marines for a year and then I'll be going back overseas as a as a company commander or as a
[03:58:14] battalion X or whatever totally nuts they came up with a bomb that grew in to perfectly good
[03:58:22] war is what I heard some of you say on this podcast yeah yeah that was that was Jim Kunkill said that
[03:58:30] good so anyways it's it's so awesome that first of all that you manage awesome that I mean it's
[03:58:37] it's just amazing to be able to sit here and talk to these guys and one of the reasons that we're
[03:58:41] able to do this is because of the support that is given to us from you the listener
[03:58:47] sure and what we've tried to do is set something up where you can support not only this podcast so
[03:58:53] that we can continue to go around and talk to the Dean Lads of the world and capture their story
[03:59:00] but also while you're doing that you can support yourself yes while you're on the path
[03:59:04] it's a mutually supporting scenario yes which is a good thing so on the path what's the the first
[03:59:11] thing that comes to mind obviously in my opinion due to so many due to just so many you need to get you get
[03:59:17] and urgent or a genie yeah 100% that was a common question when we started this hey I'm starting
[03:59:24] due to just a good of course that's good what you should I get common question easy no answer
[03:59:29] easy no or if it wasn't for that question we wouldn't even be connected to or it was that question
[03:59:35] and me telling people to buy originies even though I didn't wasn't connected with them yet
[03:59:39] yeah so that's pretty cool to think about so please relax regards yeah I'll just
[03:59:45] be wearing your legs right now by the way like right now some American denim origin jeans what
[03:59:51] are you two Jason Gardner oh we're three right here oh yeah every time I wash them they get better
[03:59:59] they get better they're so nice and you know what is coming out right now the Delta 68 jeans
[04:00:05] which are named after the may-con Delta which is where our forefathers served in Vietnam
[04:00:11] and where our forefathers in the SEAL teams wore blue jeans because they were tougher and way cooler
[04:00:20] so they're like lightweight though so anyways jeans you can get those there to your t-shirts

[04:05:53] tell them no so I can't open door if I remember correctly which I probably don't but if I do
[04:05:59] I my initial uh contention was that we don't have to say to subscribe to the podcast we don't have to
[04:06:05] say hey subscribe you know what do we have to say that nothing oh I'll just subscribe to this
[04:06:11] podcast if I like it kind of thing that I think I don't I think that was the whole contention
[04:06:16] nonetheless why is it even there then why are we saying it that's the whole reason I brought it up
[04:06:20] at that time it's like why are we even saying this remember but then we did like
[04:06:25] sent you a message yes that's how that's described that's right yeah so it's like a good reminder
[04:06:29] and then you're like see yeah okay it's all come to see thanks all right so so subscribe to the

[04:06:55] with the offshoots of conversations about your tattoo in life right yeah well here's the thing
[04:06:59] there's some things that we taught that you and I talk about and then that you and I talk about
[04:07:03] with everyone that we know yeah that doesn't quite fit in the purview of jocopotcasts actual yeah
[04:07:10] right like yes the jocopotcasts is for Dean lad yes it's not for Dean's director
[04:07:19] but the Dean has Dean's been on it but like Dean's you know we we we covered the primary
[04:07:25] jocopotcast type stuff from him but Dean has other information for us other things that we talk about

[04:09:35] shame when I meet you so no seriously uh leadership strategy tactics preorder it now so the
[04:09:42] so that the publisher knows how many to print we all know that this has been a problem for some

[04:10:54] discipline goes freedom field manual you can get that book if you want to get after it and what's
[04:11:01] interesting about that book is there's no book like it and my publisher I was like is this
[04:11:08] the biggest risk you've ever took with published in a book and he's like oh absolutely not even
[04:11:12] close there's no book like it it's totally outside of any other normal book so yes this is a big risk
[04:11:19] but it it outperformed every model of sales that they had created for it like even though that
[04:11:28] well if it really does great it'll be here it I did all that so why word a mouth and you all
[04:11:34] spread the word so thank you discipline because freedom field manual and then of course there is
