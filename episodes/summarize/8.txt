You know, people have these pet peeves about, like for example, when people call me boss, you know, you know, when people say, hey, what's up? So a lot of people, especially if they're trying to cut up or drop some weight, and you know, if you're training for something, you got to make weight that's, you know, that's going to be a little bit more specific strategy, but a lot of times people will starve themselves. I know, I know some guys that have done extreme yoga, and I think extreme yoga is, you know, once you go beyond what is normal or a little beyond normal, you start to injure yourself And I think that when people, I think when people take extended periods of time off, and by that I think I mean, you know, you're starting to get into like two weeks, three weeks, maybe a month of not doing anything. Say stuff like, hey, it was true, you know, they say something that's rude or whatever and they'll be like, hey, I speak the truth if you don't like it kind of that's like lack of tact. Also, when it in regards to being conscious of, like, your movement a lot of times, I know this is the case for me, where I'll get little injuries from just like, racking or unracking weights just because it's like, oh, maybe I need to do more functional training, my friend. And I think one of the things that, the kind of the thing that I say to people when they say, Look, this is crushing me and I feel horrible and I don't know if I'm going to be able to get back. They know that there's a battle going on within you, that there's a battle you've got to fight every day, that there's a spirit that's going to be rebuilt when it's broken down. But they're all, I mean, we could just sit here and the rest of this podcast could be, you know, I come in up with the various frictions in life, whether it's, you know, who want to sleep more, want not, not the gym isn't close enough to my house. and you, um, like, how you're staying, bodyweight squats, you'll just do, you know, like if you're, if you had a six-squat workout planned, and you feel your lower back or your IT band is a big one where when you, when you get after it in squats, that'll, um, a lot of times act up. And when you work on this, what I learned early on and understanding the importance of this, I think really, really helped is if you eat right after you work out, don't think that you're going to eat a meal, and that's going to fuel your workout. And the whole thing was, you know, it said a lot, the whole thing was exercises the only thing that affects every other part of your life, the only thing. And this is how do you figure out when something is like, you know, the right thing to do, do the right thing. But you're going to listen, you're going to learn, you're going to talk to people about what you're doing. You know, we're going for a deadlift and then you're going for a mile time run So when you're doing something, if you say, okay, I'm going to go on, you know, cable news tomorrow and I'm going to debrief everybody what I did. Yeah, like you know people, rude people, for example, they'll they'll say stuff. I think stretching is important, but I think people take it to an excess, and I think when you do too much of it, I think it's, I think it's causes problems.
