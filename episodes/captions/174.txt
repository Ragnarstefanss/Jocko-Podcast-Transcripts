00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocopotcast number 174 with echo Charles and me, Jocco-Willink. Good evening echo. Good evening.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000 So I was the commander of the training detachment, which runs the tactical kind of advanced training for the West Coast seal teams.
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:32.000 And when I was in that position, one of the things that you have to do when you're in a leadership position is you have to give evaluations for everyone that works for you.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000 If to basically write down and evaluate how good they are and how well they do their job.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000 This is normal for everyone in the Navy and everyone in the military really.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000 And in the Navy it's a 5.0 system that you're getting great and so 5.0 is the best and 1.0 is the worst.
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000 I don't know if you can go lower than that you probably can but there are rules about how many people you can put at the top.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000 You have to, it's called forced ranking. If you've heard of that, forced ranking means you have to actually rank everyone.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000 So if you have 10 people working for you, you have to rank this is my number one guy, this is my number two guy all the way down through number 10.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And so what you cannot do is you can't just say, hey everyone's great, everyone's a 5.0.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000 That's, that's, you're not allowed to do that.
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000 And believe it or not, that's what people would do.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000 Most people would just, they have to evaluate someone, guess what they say, hey you're great, everything great.
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000 And you wouldn't think that the military, right, the military would have a hard time telling people like hey here's some areas where you need to improve.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:02:00.000 You wouldn't think that the military, especially like the seal teams, you know the big tough seal is going to have a hard time telling someone hey this is where your performance is could be better, right?
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000 But actually no one likes having those hard conversations, I should say just about no one likes having those hard conversations.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000 And in fact, this is completely evident in the fact that there was an old evaluation system when I first got into the Navy.
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000 And there, you didn't have to force rank, you could just make everyone perfect, basically on paper and that's actually what happened.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000 That system was a four point O system, so it was a four point O was the highest that you could get.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000 And everyone was a four point O guy.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000 Everyone got four point O's in everything.
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000 And actually I have to take that back.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000 And I think I might have talked about this before, but my first evaluation that I got at a seal team, I wasn't even an opportune yet,
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000 I was going through the initial training that you used to do to seal team.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000 When you got to the seal team, you did something called STT, which was stood for seal tactical training and it basically taught you the little bit more advanced skills than you learned in Buds.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000 And I got a four point O and everything, but I actually got a three point eight in a category called human relations.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000 And I was, I guess, you know, I talked to my friends, they knew we got four point O and everything and everyone got four point O except for me.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000 I got the three point eight.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000 And so then you're supposed to get a counseling, right, from, and the officer that had written my,
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000 the officer that had written my evaluation and given me all four point O, four point O and tactics, four point O and that's four point O and the other thing.
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000 And then a three point eight in human relations.
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000 And he had to count some, he said, you have to do you have to go through and make sure that no one objects.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:53.000 And he looked at me and he said, you know, I, I give you a three point eight in, you know, in human relations because.
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000 Well, because I think you're a little too hard on people that are, that are unsat.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000 And I kind of took pride in that, you know, because I, at that time, I wasn't really playing the game, you know.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000 You know, I kind of was thinking to myself, yeah, I, that's right, you know, if you're unsat, I am going to be hard on you.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000 And you can probably guess of the group that I was in, which individual I was harger on the nanny of one else was actually that guy.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000 So that was kind of funny, but, you know, after that, after I got into a suit, tuned in, all, you know, everything was four point O all the time.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:41.000 Again, I'm not bragging at all about that because every single guy we all had four point O's across the board on everything and everyone was the best seal in the seal teams ever in the history of ever.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 That's what it was like.
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000 And everyone was, that's just the way was everyone was the best. So the nanny realizes.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000 Basically, the nanny realized that all the leaders were cowards.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000 And when it came to telling the truth to the troops about where they stood and where they could improve. So they made, they made a change.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000 They made the drastic change to the evaluation and they changed this thing called forced ranking.
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000 Where, whatever there was percentages on how many people could be ranked at the highest level.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000 Like it was like 10% of your people could be ranked at the highest level and then 20% of the next tier.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000 And it went on down the line. You didn't actually have to rank someone as bad, but you couldn't rank a bunch of people at the top.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000 And it was, it actually made a big difference all of a sudden.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000 Because now all of a sudden you had to, if you were in a leadership position, you had to give some of your people some lower rankings.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000 And you actually had to figure out who is better.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000 And,
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000 eventually what they did is, again, people not wanting to have hard conversations. Eventually what they did is because
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000 How you advance in the navy is based on your evaluations, what's what we're talking about.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000 But it's also based on how much time you have in grade. So you can't, if you make, if you're in E4,
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.000 you can't make E5 for 3 years or there's some random number. Like you cannot make E5 for 3 years.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000 And so what they started doing is just ranking you based on how long you were there for. And so, that's what they started doing.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000 So basically it didn't really help.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000 Because you still ended up just saying, oh well, you're just new and that's why you didn't get promoted.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000 Why didn't really understand that?
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000 When the very first of the forced ranking evaluations came out, I had just made E5.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000 And because I just made E5, I got ranked at the bottom of the E5s in my platoon.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000 And like I said at this time, I wasn't really playing the game really fully.
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000 So I was kind of went to my chief and my lieutenant with, hey, why am I, why am I at the bottom?
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000 How, how can I be the lowest ranking of the E5s? Because that's just wrong.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 What about this guy here? You know, what about this guy over here?
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000 You tell me that this guy is doing a better job than I am because I was working really hard and doing a good job.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000 And they didn't disagree with me.
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000 What they said is like, look, yes, jockel, you're definitely doing a better job than that guy in that guy.
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000 But here's the deal. They're up for promotion. And you're not.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000 And when you're up for promotion, you'll be at the top when you're turned.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000 And again, I wasn't really playing the game. So I said, oh, okay, you know, I get it.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000 Why didn't you just tell me that work on me, Nests? Is what was wrong? It's going on there.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000 And, you know, there, no, we're not communists. It's just, you know, this is just the way that the system organized.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000 Okay, so what you're telling is this is a communist system. Is what's happening?
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000 Thanks, Comrade.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000 And of course, they did their best to explain it to me.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000 And I didn't really listen because like I said, don't, wasn't really playing the game at this time.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000 Let's be young. You know, E5 getting after it.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000 But eventually, it was me that was evaluating people and force ranking them.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000 And then it was me that was explaining the rules of why people got ranked, where they got ranked,
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000 and why I gave them the grades that I gave them.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000 And, of course, I did this a bunch from when I was in assistant,
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000 put in commander and a put in commander and a task unit commander.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000 So I had done this a bunch. And now I was the officer in charge of the training
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000 to the academy. And I had one of the guys that didn't like where he got ranked.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000 He didn't like it. He thought he deserved higher.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000 And he thought he deserved a bunch of five hosts that the highest possible grade.
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000 And, you know, maybe not on all the criteria, but on some of them.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000 And he actually requested an office call with me, meaning he wanted to come and talk to me,
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000 which was kind of weird because at this time,
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000 people literally would just walk in my office all the time.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000 And, you know, say, hey, what's up? I got to, you know, they were talking about something.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000 I was super casual about people coming from Seemey. No, no fact, right?
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000 So in this guy went and actually organized an official meeting with me.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000 I was totally cool with it, but it was weird.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 And he came in and he had his evaluation with him and he put it on my desk.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000 And, you know, he said something along the lines of,
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000 you know, I got ranked in the middle of the pack and how did this happen?
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000 And I should be at the top or at least I should be near it.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000 And I should have five hosts and, you know, this category and that category and this other category.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000 And the guy himself, he wasn't a slacker by any stretch imagination.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000 He was a good, really solid, seal.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000 He wasn't like an over the top outstanding front runner,
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000 but he was really, really solid, which you only allowed to have a very small number.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000 Guys that you're ranking as front runners.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 And he wasn't there.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000 And, you know, I was better at this point at playing the game.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000 You know, up and down the chain of command.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000 And so what I did is I sat there and I listened to him and I listened to his perspective.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 And as I was doing that, as I was listening to this guy,
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000 you know, it's thinking myself, you know, this guy's a hardworking seal.
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000 He thinks he should have higher grades across the board.
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000 He thinks he should be a top rank guy with five pointos.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000 And as I'm sitting there listening to him, I'm thinking,
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000 why does he actually think that?
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000 Why does he think that?
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000 What is going on in his head that he thinks that he should be a five pointo?
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000 And of course, I'm thinking to myself, this is somehow my fault.
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000 This is going to be my fault because I'm the leader and I have a guy.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000 I have a guy that's concerned enough about his rankings that he's in here talking to me.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000 He actually set an appointment to come and talk to me about this.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000 So obviously, I had not done a good job at this point of explaining things to him.
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000 And if he doesn't get it, obviously there's going to be more people that think the same way.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000 Then, you know, he's not the only one.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000 When someone comes to you the problem, they're not the only one.
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000 So that's what I'm thinking.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000 And I'm thinking that he's thinking he's a five pointo.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000 That's what he's thinking.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000 He's thinking he's a five pointo.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000 And he's not.
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000 And he thinks he should be.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000 And then I'm trying to figure out I'm thinking to myself,
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000 Okay, how do I explain to him where he is missing the mark?
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000 How can I explain to him that he's not quite a five pointo?
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Because five pointo is outstanding.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000 And then the answer kind of jumped out at me.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000 The answer was the evaluation form itself.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000 That's what it was.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000 Because the evaluation form itself actually gives the definition of what a five pointo
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000 Sailor is.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000 What a five pointo leader is.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000 And really when you break it down, what a five pointo human being is the evaluation actually spells it out
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 in plain English.
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000 So I picked up the evaluation form that he had brought in.
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000 And I started to read chunks of it to him.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 So the first little chunk that I read to read to him.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000 There's a section called professional knowledge.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000 And if you are a five pointo in professional knowledge, it gives you a list of what you are.
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000 And here's what it says.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 If you're a five pointo in professional knowledge, this is what it says.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000 Recognized expert sought out by all for technical knowledge.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Use his knowledge to solve complex technical problems.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000 Meets advancement requirements early and with distinction.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000 So you know, I looked at him and said, okay, recognized expert.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 Are you a recognized expert?
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000 Does how often are you getting called by the East Coast or by the seal team to help them solve a problem?
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000 The answer was he's not.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000 He's a good solid guy.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Really good instructor.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000 He's not a.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000 He's not a recognized expert.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000 And he knew it.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000 And then I read the the three pointo, which is a middle grade.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000 Like, hey, this is your average situation.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000 I said, it may be this is you.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000 I said, listen, strong working knowledge of rating, specialty, and job.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000 Reliably applies knowledge to accomplish tasks.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000 Meets advancement requirements on time.
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000 This is a solid human being, right?
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000 This is a solid.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000 That's a three pointo right there.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000 And again, as I'm reading to this, this guy, yeah, he had strong working knowledge.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000 For sure.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000 He was applying that knowledge to his job.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000 For sure.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000 He was doing that.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000 So that's cool.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000 That's three pointo.
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000 What about quality of work, another section, quality of work.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000 Here's five pointo for quality of work.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000 Needs no supervision.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000 Always produces exceptional work.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000 No rework required.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000 Maximizes resources.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000 So, needs no resources.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000 Let's think about that.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000 I mean, this guy was working in another department.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000 He was definitely being managed.
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000 And then always produces exceptional work.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Again, this is as good.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000 You can get it embedded in exceptional.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000 So, I said, is that you?
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 Do you not need any supervision?
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000 And he knew, I mean, I know I worked in the department.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000 I know what's going on.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000 He's not going to, you can't lie to me.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000 And I said, how about this?
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Needs little supervision.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000 Producers quality work.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000 Few errors.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000 Use resources efficiently.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000 You know what that is?
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000 That's three pointo.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000 I actually gave you a four pointo.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000 Somewhere in between those two.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000 I'm actually being kind of generous.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000 What do you think?
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000 How about military bearing and character?
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000 Let's see what that looks like.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000 Here's what, here's what, here's what the definition for military bearing and character is.
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000 US Navy, five pointo evaluation.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000 Exemplary, personal, appearance.
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000 Model of conduct, conduct on and off duty.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:26.000 A leader in physical readiness exemplifies Navy core values honor courage commitment.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000 Now, this guy is sitting in my office.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000 He's in sloppy PT gear.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000 His hair is a little bit long.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000 And he's not, he's not one of these super stud seals.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000 That's an awesome physical shape.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000 He's kind of a guy that liked to party a bit.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000 And he was a hard work in seal.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000 A great guy.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000 But I'm saying he wasn't exactly a model of conduct on and off duty.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000 Think about what that means.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000 A model of conduct.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 So that's five pointo.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Then I said, listen, let me tell you what I tell him.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Let me tell you what three pointo is.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000 Excellent personal appearance.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000 Excellent conduct.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000 Conchienceously complies with regulations.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000 Complies with physical readiness program.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 Lives up to Navy core values honor courage commitment.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000 But to me, you know, you're a pretty square away guy, but how do you do on the last PT test?
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000 Because you didn't knock it out of the park.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000 I know that.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000 Right?
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000 So are you telling him?
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000 Yes, you're reading them.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000 I'm reading them.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 I'm doing what we're doing right here.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000 I'm straight up reading them to them.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:33.000 Because because it was, it's really obvious that these standards are very, very high.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000 And, you know, also, here's the bottom of the barrel.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000 Okay.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000 This is one pointo.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000 Four, four values.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 Or for military bearing and character.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000 This is one pointo.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000 Consistently unsatisfactory appearance, poor self control, conduct resulting in disciplinary action,
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000 unable to meet one or more physical readiness requirements, fails to live up to one or more Navy core values honor courage commitment.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000 So this guy clearly is not a one pointo.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000 That's a, that's a, that's a bad sailor.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000 But this guy is solid.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000 He's in the middle. I think I had him with a four pointo. I said, I, I we good with a four row.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000 Mm-hmm.
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000 Or you can tell me that you crushed that you were the leader of the pack on the last PT test that we did.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000 You know, what, will you tell me were you the, were you the five pointo?
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000 No, no.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000 Couldn't honestly say it.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000 And by now he kind of, he kind of got the message that he's no one pointo, but he definitely wasn't a five pointo either.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000 And, and clearly what I realized is he never actually,
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000 read through what those standards were.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:51.000 And clearly that was my fault for not making sure that this guy and the rest of the people at my command understood what the grading criteria was.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000 And I started to, trying to do that.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000 And I started to realize that the, the grading criteria was actually solid.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000 And it was a good guide to being a, a really good seal, a really good sailor, a really good person.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:17.000 And as you read through some of these five pointo qualities, here's the one for command organizational climate slash equal opportunity.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000 So if you're, this is your, if you're a five o in this category,
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:30.000 measureably contributes to the Navy's increased retention and reduced attrition objective, proactive leader, exemplary mentor, involved in subordinates personal development,
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:39.000 leading to professional growth and sustained commitment, initiates support programs for military civilian and families to achieve exceptional command and organizational climate,
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000 the model of achievement,
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000 develops unit cohesion by valuing differences as strengths.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 So let's think about that.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:57.000 That's, that's a massive, who's going to get five o in that in the SEAL teams, not too many people because in the SEAL teams, who's initiating support programs?
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Means you're, you're actively starting a program to help support, right?
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000 There's not a lot of guys that are going to hit five point. Oh, and that's the way it should be.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000 Here's what five point. Oh, looks like for personal job accomplishment and initiative, energetic self-starter,
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000 completes tasks or qualifications early far better than expected.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000 So you're not just doing, you're doing it early and it's still even better than everyone else plans and prioritizes wisely and with exceptional foresight.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000 Seeks extra responsibility and takes on the hardest jobs.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000 That's five point.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Here's the, here's the five point. Oh, for teamwork, team builder inspires cooperation and progress.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000 Focuses goals and techniques for teams, the best at accepting and offering team direction.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000 That's a team player. That's teamwork.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000 And here's, here's the, here's how you get a five point o in leadership.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000 Now think about this. You think you're a good seal. You think you're a good sailor.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000 And you think I'm, I'm a good leader, right?
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000 Here's what you have to do to get a five point o inspiring motivator and trainer.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000 Subordinates reach highest level of growth and development. So now, since I'm even about you anymore,
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000 this is about you being a leader and you, not just what you do, but what your subordinates,
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000 your subordinates have to reach the highest level of growth and development. It goes on superb organizer.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Great foresight develops process improvements and efficiencies.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000 Leadership achievements, leadership achievement dramatically further command mission and vision.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000 So what you do is a leader dramatically further is the mission.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000 Perseverals through the toughest challenges and inspires other, others exceptional communicator.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000 How many people do you know that are exceptional communicators? There's not a lot of people that are exceptional communicators.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000 That's a hard thing. That's not only being born with some communication skills.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000 It's actively working and honing those skills through your lifetime before someone tells you you're an exceptional communicator.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000 Makes subordinates safety conscience, maintains top safety record, constantly improves the personal and professional lives of others.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000 So this is barely even about you anymore. It's how well, how well does your team do?
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000 So you've got to be 100% squared away if you're going to get a 5.0 in leadership. That's just the way it is.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:31.000 And like I said, you're not just getting judged on your success, but on the success, not just of the mission, but of the actual individual people that work for you.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:44.000 And so this, this granular look at these descriptions kind of changed this guy's perspective.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000 And now he actually saw what he was supposed to be doing. He actually knew what he was aiming at.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000 And he didn't know that before. And you know who's fault it is that he didn't know that it's my fault.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:03.000 Because I'm the guy that's in charge and I thought everyone knew or I thought at least everyone was aiming as high as they possibly could at everything.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000 But that's actually naive. It's naive for a couple reasons.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000 Not only is not everyone aiming to be the best they can.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:21.000 I don't know some people don't care about some things, but sometimes people don't actually understand what it is that they're supposed to be aiming at. They don't understand what the metric is, how they're being measured.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:28.000 And clearly, you have to have something to aim at.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:37.000 And if you don't have anything to aim at, then you're never going to get anywhere you're never going to hit the target that's you're not aiming at. You have to aim at the target to hit it.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000 You have to know what you're trying to be or you won't be that.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000 And the Navy, I think, with this evaluation form, does a decent job.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:58.000 If you kind of can take a step back and one problem is with the Navy evaluation system and all the evaluation systems in the military is they're very administrative.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:08.000 It turns into much more of a paperwork drill than it is an actual attempt to make people improve themselves.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000 Right? It's there, but people are going to fall out. This is where I fell out. Cool. I'm up for motion. Cool. I may not read it.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Right? They don't actually, it's not a true counseling objective isn't to really truly improve those people.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000 That's one of the problems with this, with the counseling system inside the Navy and it happens in the other branches as well.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000 But if you read that sheet and you kind of take a look at it, then you realize, okay, there are some things that I can aim at now.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000 And the Navy does a decent job of that. I'll tell you the Marine Corps does an even better job.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:54.000 The United States Marine Corps evaluation system is more detailed and it's more descriptive and it's more complete. The Navy system, the whole Navy evaluation is two pages long.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000 The Marine Corps, there's six pages long.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:08.000 And one thing that's interesting about the Marine Corps, in the Navy one they list, okay, you're a one-point-o. This is what you're like as a one-point-o.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:19.000 The Marine Corps doesn't even give descriptions for the low end of the spectrum. They don't even exist. They're not going to waste time describing a loser Marine.
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:30.000 They have a higher minimum standard, basically. But this is one thing that struck me. The first time I kind of noticed the Marine Corps evaluation system, because it's an administrative thing.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:43.000 So it's not like I would see it on a regular basis. When I was in Ramadios in the Brigade Tactical Operations Center, and I was probably there for a meeting with the Brigade Commander or whatever.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000 And was there for whatever reason? And one of the Marine officers was in there who I knew and we were kind of talking.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000 And he was filling out one evaluation for one of his guys and he was on the back page of his evaluation.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000 And I was just being nosy. I guess looking at what it was like, looking at what their system was like comparing its R system.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:16.000 And I was looking at the form on the last page, the page he was actually working on. There was a graphic representation of Marines and of how they rank Marines.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000 And it kind of looked like a Christmas tree. So if you picture a Christmas tree and the whole Christmas tree is made up of little eagle globe and anchors, which is the symbol of the Marine Corps.
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:33.000 And so there's a bunch of little eagle globe and anchors. And they're all positioned on this piece of paper and it looks like a Christmas tree.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000 And so the bottom, actually the bottom of this graphic, the bottom of this Christmas tree is just an empty space. There's nothing there.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000 And that line is represented. There's a little indicator that shows what that line represents. That line represents the unqualified Marine.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:02.000 So there should be no unqualified Marines in your unit. And then it goes up one level and I've just got one single eagle globe and anchor representing one Marine.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:11.000 And this, this is, it looks like the trunk of the Christmas tree. And that line is labeled a qualified Marine.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:21.000 So now you've got one guy, you know, or percentage wise, one person that is simply just a qualified Marine.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000 He's qualified, but there's not there shouldn't be that many of them.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:38.000 And then they go, now he picture Christmas tree above the trunk, now it's a big wide area. And that's where they go to this next level, which has the most, it's like the middle third of the Christmas tree.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000 And that area, they label that area.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000 One of the many highly qualified professionals who form the majority of this grade.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:00.000 So the biggest chunk of people is sort of in the middle third of this Christmas tree. And that's what it is. Hey, that's what most of the guys are.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:14.000 There's highly, highly qualified people. They make up the most of this group of that are that I'm evaluating. And there they are. And then above that third on this Christmas tree is a, now the Christmas tree is getting smaller, right?
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000 So now we're getting into a narrow group in this narrow group is labeled.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:32.000 And it's called so if you're in this group you're being labeled as one of the few exceptionally qualified Marines.
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000 And that again, that's a much smaller number than that middle group.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000 And then you get to the top of the Christmas tree, where there is a single eagle globe and anchor representing the very best of this group.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:02.000 And it's up there alone at the pinnacle of performance. And there's a label for this singular Marine at the top of his group.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000 And the label says the eminently qualified Marine.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:19.000 And I remember when I read that, when I read those words, the eminently qualified Marine.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:27.000 And I thought to myself, that is the ultimate praise.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:40.000 And that's pretty much how the Marine Corps evaluation ends. And it ends in this epic way because it is.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:49.000 It's weird to say this. It's an epic document. It's an epic document. And I want to talk about this document today.
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000 And I want to start off by by the way that the document itself starts off. So this is the Marine Corps fitness report. This is how they grade Marines.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000 And it starts off with the common dance guidance. So the first thing they get is guidance from the most senior Marine in the Marine Corps.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:13.000 And the common dance guidance says the completed fitness report is the most important information component in manpower management.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:24.000 It is the primary means of evaluating a Marine's performance. And is the common dance primary tool for the selection of personnel for promotion augmentation, resident schooling command and duty assignments.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Therefore, the completion of this report is one of an officer's most critical responsibilities.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:45.000 Inherent in this duty is the commitment of each reporting senior and reviewing officer to ensure the integrity of the system by giving close attention to accurate marking and timely reporting.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:56.000 Every officer serves a role in the scrupulous maintenance of this evaluation system ultimately important to both the individual and the Marine Corps.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:04.000 Inflationary markings only serve to dilute the actual value of each report.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:14.000 Reviewing officers will not concur with inflated reports. So out of the gate we're getting put in check do not come here telling everyone they're great.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000 That's not that's not going to fly. We're rejecting that outright from the start. Now we start the evaluation again. This is set up a little bit similar.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:36.000 To the Navy and they start breaking out what your performance is based on the first thing that it's based on is mission accomplishment.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000 And mission accomplishment they break into two things the first thing is performance. So here's what it says about performance of mission accomplishment.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:56.000 A accomplishment results achieved during the reporting period. How well those duties inherent to a Marines billet plus all additional duties formally and informally assigned work carried out.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000 Reflects a Marines aptitude, competence and commitment to the unit success above personal reward.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:14.000 Indicators are time and restorts management task prioritization and tenacity to achieve positive ends consistently.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:27.000 So the low end it says meets requirements of billet and additional duties aptitude commitment and competence meet expectations results maintain status quo.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000 So that's that's that's that year you're doing your job. And then if you're at the high end of the spectrum results far surpass expectations.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:56.000 Recognizes and exploits new resources creates opportunities emulated sought after as an expert with influence beyond unit impact significant innovative approaches to problems produce significant gains in quality and efficiency.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:05.000 If you just take that single bullet and that's what you try and achieve you're smoking.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000 You're crushing you I want to you have someone like that working for you and you're in heaven because this guy's going to make things happen.
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Next up proficiency demonstrates technical knowledge and practical skill in the execution of the Marines overall duties.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:34.000 Combines training, education and experience translates skills into actions which contribute to accomplishing tasks and missions in parts knowledge to others.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 Think about this one translates skills and actions.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000 That's it that's kind of a big deal. How many people have skills but they can't translate them in actions.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000 Think about that's your life. Hey, you got some skills, but you don't use them. You can't put them anywhere. You can't put them into effect.
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:57.000 Here's the middle grade for proficiency demonstrates mastery of all required skills. So if you've mastered your skills, you're still just in the middle.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:08.000 Expertise education and experience consistently enhance mission accomplishment innovative troublesheuter and problem solver effectively in parts skills to support it.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000 These are the kind of things where if you know that you're supposed to impart skills to your support, you pay attention to it. You start doing it.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000 But you might not recognize that that's part of your job. That's part of your life.
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:28.000 Here's what it sounds like if you're an expert. True expert in field knowledge and skills impact far beyond those of peers.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Translates broad based education and experience into forward thinking innovative actions.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000 Makes immeasurable impact on mission accomplishment.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000 Purely teacher selflessly imparts expertise to support in its peers and seniors.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:57.000 Think about that. That is a high bar. That is a high bar. You could work. You could work diligently every single day and fall short of that.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000 But let me tell you it's important that you know that you should be working towards it.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:14.000 Next section individual character. Isn't it legit when you're going to grade someone on their character?
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:26.000 This is outstanding. This is outstanding. How many people are not thinking about what their character is? How many people are not actively minding the way that their actions reflect their character?
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000 That's the first step. That's the first step because you might think while I'm being videoed.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:53.000 But this is what I'm expected to do. So you might be doing something that's not correct.
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:03.000 You might be off chart. You might be aiming at the wrong thing. Hey, I'm acting like a tough guy. I want everyone to know that I'm tough. You realize oh, that's actually stupid.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000 Yeah. So you can be, you can have in your mind that I'm going to keep my character, but you're wrong.
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:15.000 Because you might be aiming at the wrong thing. So this gives you some pretty specific things to aim at.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:26.000 Topic number one. Courage. Mooray or physical strength to overcome danger fear difficulty or anxiety. Personal acceptance of responsibility and accountability.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Placing conscience over competing interests. Regardless of consequences.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:46.000 Conscious overriding decision to risk bodily harm or death to a compus the mission or save others the will to persevere despite uncertainty.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:36:00.000 What if you're thinking about the fact that you're getting graded on your will to persevere despite uncertainty? You think about that every day. You don't know what your future holds, but you're going to persevere regardless.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000 Think if you're getting graded on that every day.
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Here's what the bottom end of the spectrum is demonstrates inner strength. So at the minimum you're demonstrating inner strength and acceptance of responsibility.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:29.000 Commence for it with the scope of duties and experience willing to face moral or physical danger in pursuit of mission accomplishment. So even at the low end of the spectrum you're still willing to face danger moral or physical challenges.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:40.000 Here's the middle guided by conscience in all actions. Provenability. Provenability to overcome danger fear difficulty or anxiety.
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:50.000 Exhibits bravery in the face of adversity and certainty. Not deterred by moral difficult situations morally difficult situations or hazardous responsibilities.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000 How often are people deterred by difficult situations?
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000 Daily morally difficult situations.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:15.000 Here's the top of the spectrum for courage. Uncommon bravery and capacity to overcome obstacles and inspire others in the face of moral dilemma or life threatening danger.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:27.000 So not even just about you. You have to actually take it to level your inspiring others demonstrated under the most adverse conditions selfless.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Always places conscience over competing interest regardless of physical or personal consequences.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000 That's that competition we talked about. The competition between oh I'm going to take care of myself and I'm going to take care of the team.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:48.000 But you know what's doing what's right to do instead of what is easy to do.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.000 The next section that you get created on your individual character is effectiveness under stress.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000 This is just outstanding. Because it's not think about this. You don't even see this in business.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:13.000 In business. I don't see this in when people evaluate other other in the business world, but there's stress in business world. There's a different kind of stress, but it's stress.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000 Here's effectiveness under stress. Here's what you're doing. Thinking functioning and leading effectively under conditions of physical and or mental pressure.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:30.000 And composure appropriate for the situation while displaying steady purpose of action enabling one to its inspire others while continuing to lead under adverse conditions.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Physical and emotional strength resilience and endurance are elements.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000 Low end of the spectrum. Exhibits discipline and stability under pressure. Judgment and effective problem solving skills are evident.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000 I'm going to go into the spectrum. By the way, how many people do you think do you know that don't exhibit any discipline or stability under pressure?
00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:01.000 Right? There's all kinds of people. There's all kinds of people. And we know when it's the last time you didn't do a good job under pressure.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000 Probably this morning. It happens, right?
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:14.000 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Especially when you're not thinking about it, especially when you're not aimed at the correct response to pressure. Yeah.
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000 Especially when you haven't put a standard in your mind.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000 Remember when you used to kind of freak out in your jutsu when you got claustrophobic, right? Sure.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Right? Sure. You'd get an imposition. Yeah.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000 Usually side control. Right? You didn't like that. Yeah.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000 You didn't like the pressure on the chest. There were more circumstances surrounding those scenarios.
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000 But you're mental. Yeah. More problems. Yeah. I would have to, yeah.
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000 Okay. Yes. I do remember that. At some point, you said to yourself, alright.
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000 I cannot act that way anymore. You made a, you said a bar for yourself.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000 Yes, sir. That's the beginning of solving the problem.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000 Yeah. That's what I love about this. It's actually setting a bar of when you're under stress. This is how you got to act.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000 If you're, if you're a little above average for effective or some stress, here's where you're at.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000 Consistently demonstrates maturity, mental agility, and will power during periods of adversity.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.000 Provides order to chaos through the application of intuition, problem solving skills, and leadership.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000 Composure reassures other.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000 Imagine you're around a team and this is the average guy. This is just so impressive.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000 But my point is, unless you tell your guys what average is, they won't know it.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000 They don't understand it.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000 Here's the high end. So this is when you look at your troops and you say, this is what I want you to do.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:54.000 We come under massive amounts of stress. Here's the model I want you to try and perform as demonstrates.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000 Sell the matched presence of mind under the most demanding circumstances.
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:09.000 Stabilizes any situation through the resolute and timely application of direction, focus, and personal presence.
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000 Now, what I was doing this, I was actually only going to read the high end when I was thinking about this.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000 But then I realized each one of these builds, and that person at the high end already has the other two.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000 But there's other elements in there that aren't mentioned in the high end.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:28.000 So you've got to mention and you assume when someone's on the high end, they got those obviously. They got the lower end things wrapped up.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000 So you've got to combine all these three together.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000 The low grade, the middle grade and the high grade.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.000 We want people to show an issue. Talk about this all the time. This is the essence of decentralized command is that people show an issue.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000 Here's what they say about an issue of action in the absence of specific direction.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000 Seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting.
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000 So I'm listening to all of these as my own.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000 This whole thing.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000 And at first I was like, oh, that's cool. That's how the Navy kind of evaluates people.
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000 You're going to talk about the Marines and stuff.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000 But maybe like the second little part you started reading, I just started applying it to myself.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000 That's what I'm saying.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000 Like my life.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000 Yeah.
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000 Okay. So you know, we're all part of it.
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000 Like if you have a family, if you're the dad or something, or whatever.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000 If you're in a family unit, you're part of a team right there.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000 And you know, your goals change from time to time.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000 But you sort of know the goals.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000 So I'm like thinking of my mind every little element that you're talking about.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000 I'm like, okay, let me evaluate myself for sure with this.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000 Like how good and your right man.
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000 So a lot of times like, okay, so performing under stress.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000 I don't like this all these little things.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000 You're going to the beach and you're trying to make it on the, you know,
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000 The beach.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 The beach.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000 You're trying to be a nice.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000 You're trying to make it the beach.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000 We have a high stress level.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000 Yeah.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000 But the kids need their water and they need their change of clothes.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000 You might get cold.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000 They need to jacket all the stuff.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000 Meanwhile, the clock is taking you know, daylight.
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000 You don't want to miss sunset all the stuff.
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000 So how are you going to perform under that stress?
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000 You know, and I get it.
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Well, the fun thing is you're, you're bringing up this, you're bringing up this.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000 And I'm actually completely making fun of you for bringing up that stress.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000 How often are you at a public place?
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000 And you see a family.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000 And they're running later, whatever.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000 And you see a leader of the family, mother or father,
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000 Freaking out losing their composure over the stress that we are actually joking about.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000 You're a little bit serious.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000 I'm joking about it.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000 But still, you see people lose their minds because of dumb things.
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000 Oh, yeah.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 And there's a little bit of stress in their world.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000 And they drop off.
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000 They freak out for them.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Exactly.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000 So my question is, do those people, has anyone ever sat them down and explained to them what the standard is?
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000 Yes, sir.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000 And that's my point here.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000 Yeah.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000 A lot of times, people don't even recognize.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000 They don't even know they don't even understand what the
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:08.000 eminently qualified human being is how they are going to act in these situations.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000 Yeah.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000 Totally, totally exactly 100% right there.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.000 So like, okay, so, you know how you ever have a guy who like loses temper and then like you say, hey, you kind of lost it there.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000 And then he goes back to how he felt like almost like the way he felt justified.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000 Oh, yeah.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000 Yeah.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000 So you just understand, here's the thing, Brad.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000 We know you felt like that.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000 Yeah.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000 Really demonstrate.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 So you don't have to explain that.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000 But yeah, you were feeling this and you behaved the certain way.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000 But if that guy knew that he was being evaluated on his behavior, regardless of how he feels, but he'd be aiming how you put it.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000 That's it.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000 That's the key part.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000 It's not, it's not just the grading part.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000 It's, you have to know what the standard is because that guy that might not even understand.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:06.000 If I lose my temper, I think it was, I think it was JP, JP really took it to heart when he heard me say losing your temper as a weakness.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000 Yeah.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:16.000 Before that, he just didn't, you know, because you see other people in your life and see other team guys, you see your dad, you see your uncle and they fly off the handle and you almost have a respect for it.
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000 Right?
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000 You definitely respect your when your dad loses your temper, you kind of think, wow, that's powerful.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000 How can I have some of that power?
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000 Well, you just do that, right?
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000 So you just learn mechanism and then eventually you realize or someone tells you, hey, when you lose your temper, you're not in control.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000 Matter of fact, you're not in control at all.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000 And whatever made you lose your temper is controlling you and losing your temper is, is a weakness.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000 And so that's the big difference.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:51.000 It's not just, hey, you're being graded, you're being watched, which is definitely a great mindset to have, but you have to understand what the parameters are that you're being measured by that you're being graded on.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000 And that's where this comes into play.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000 The next section I just started with initiative, it we want subordinates to take initiative, but we want everyone to take initiative, right?
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Your kids, you want your kids to take initiative.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000 You want people in your free one, everyone to take initiative.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:18.000 I used to say to the young seal, you put them commanders and task them commanders, I would say, imagine if everyone in your, everyone in your fire team leaders just was doing something smart.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000 They just took initiative and made it happen.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:28.000 Your job becomes so easy because you don't have to control everything everyone just making things happen. That's initiative.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000 So here's what it says about initiative action in the absence of specific direction.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000 Seeing what needs to be done and acting without prompting.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:49.000 The instinct to begin a task and follow through energetically on one's own accord, being creative, proactive, and decisive, transforming opportunity into action.
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:58.000 So that's what initiative. If you're on the low end, you demonstrate willingness to take action, the absence of specific direction.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000 Acts commensurate with grade, training and experience.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000 That's what we expect of you.
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000 A little bit better.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000 In the middle, self-motivated and action-oriented.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Forsight and energy consistently transform opportunity into action, develops and pursues creative initiative solutions.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000 Or sorry, innovative solutions. Acts without prompting self-struck.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:29.000 That's what we want. And then here we go, the high end. Highly motivated and proactive.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:36.000 Displays exceptional awareness of surroundings and environment, uncanny ability to anticipate mission requirements,
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.000 and quickly formulate original, far-reaching solutions always takes decisive, effective action.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:49.000 With definitions like that, it's no wonder there's only one Marina at the top of that Christmas tree.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000 Because that is a squared away individual right there.
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000 Far, you know what's crazy about this?
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000 Having put so many people through training myself.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Even though there's only one allotted space up there, there are so many people that are capable of this kind of behavior.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000 It's way more than one percent. It's way more than 10 percent.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000 If you have people that understand what the parameters are and really aim to them,
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000 you can get a lot closer than most people would think.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000 Yeah.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000 And I mean, obviously, I don't know.
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000 But it seems like what you're talking about.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000 Like a lot of people just don't know.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000 No, no, no, no. The standard and they don't know.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000 They don't know.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000 They don't know. It's not been made clear to them.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000 The next section.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000 Leadership.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000 And this is broken.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000 It's a multiple sections.
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000 Obviously, because leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000 So this is their biggest section.
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000 Leadership.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Section number one leading subordinates.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000 The inseparable relationship between leader and lead.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000 The application of leadership principles to provide direction and motivate subordinates.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000 Using authority, persuasion and personality to influence subordinates to accomplish
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000 assigned tasks.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000 Sustaining motivation and morale while maximizing subordinates performance.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000 So there you go.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000 That's what you're going to do as a leader.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000 Low end.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000 Engaged provides instructions and directs execution.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Seats to accomplish mission in ways that sustain motivation and morale.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000 Actions contribute to unit effectiveness.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000 Cool.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000 So you're acceptable.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:35.000 Middle ground achieves a highly effective balance between direction and delegation.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000 We're talking a little dichotomy.
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000 Effectively task subordinates and clearly delineates.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000 Extenders expect it.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Enhances performance through constructive supervision.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 Foster's motivation and enhances morale.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000 Builds and sustains teams.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000 Successfully meet mission requirements.
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000 Encourage is initiative and canter among subordinates.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000 So you can see that the low end you're kind of just telling people what to do a little bit.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000 Right?
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000 Now you're starting to ask for feedback.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000 You're starting to build that bond.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000 Here's the high end.
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000 Number one thing for the high end.
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000 Promotes creativity and energy among subordinates by striking into the ideal balance of
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000 direction and delegation.
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:32.000 Achieve's highest levels of performance from subordinates by encouraging individual initiative.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000 That's decentralized command.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000 I'm going to let you guys run and that's going to maximize performance.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000 This is an incredible term.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:49.000 Ingenders willing subordination, loyalty and trust that allow subordinates to overcome their perceived limitations.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000 Whaling subordination when your team actually wants to follow you.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:51:00.000 Personal leadership fosters highest level of motivation and morale.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000 Ensuring mission accomplishment even in the most difficult circumstances.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Next section.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.000 Developing subordinates commitment to train, educate and challenge all Marines regardless of race,
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000 religion, ethnic background or gender, mentorship, cultivating professional and personal development of subordinates,
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000 developing team players in a speed of core.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:33.000 Ability to combine teaching and coaching, creating an atmosphere, tolerant of mistakes in the course of learning.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000 You know, here you'll think about that very often in the Marine Corps and they work tolerant of mistakes.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000 That's how you learn.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000 Low end to the spectrum maintains an environment that allows personal professional development.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000 Ensures subordinates participate in all mandated development programs.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000 Middle ground develops and institutes innovative programs.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000 So you're proactively trying to bring up and raise your subordinates make them better.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000 To include PMA which is professional military education.
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.000 That emphasize personal and professional development of subordinates.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000 Challenges subordinates to exceed their perceived potential.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000 They're by enhancing unit morale and effectiveness.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:22.000 Creates an environment where all Marines are confident to learn through trial and error as a mentor prepares subordinates for increased responsibilities and duties.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000 By the way, this is the number two item under leadership.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000 The first one is leading.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000 The second one is developing your subordinates.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000 Here's the top end of the spectrum.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:40.000 Why'd be recognized and and emulated as a teacher, coach and leader?
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:48.000 Any Marine would desire to serve with this Marine because they know they will grow personally and professionally.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:57.000 Subordinate and unit performance far surpasses expected results due to mentorship and team building talents.
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:04.000 Subordinate development is infectious extending beyond the unit.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000 That's bold.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000 Now you're training your people so well that other people in other units are starting to train their people.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000 You're thinking about that impact right there.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 That's how you develop.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000 You develop your subordinates so much that some other leader in a different company in a different platoon.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000 In a different battalion says we're going to start following that program.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000 That's the leadership right there.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000 Section number three, setting the example.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000 The most visible facet of leadership.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000 How well a Marine serves as a role model for all others.
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:47.000 Personal action demonstrates the highest standards of conduct, ethical behavior, fitness and appearance,
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000 bearing demeanor and self-discipline are elements.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000 Low end.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.000 Maintains Marine Corps standards for appearance, weight and uniform wear.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Sistains required level of physical fitness at ears to the tenants of the Marine Corps values.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000 Fine.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000 You're accepted.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000 Middle grade.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:18.000 Personal conduct on and off duty reflects highest Marine Corps standards of integrity, bearing and appearance.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:27.000 The director is exceptional, actively seeks self-improvement in wide-ranging areas, dedication to duty and professional example,
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000 encourage others self-improvement efforts.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000 That's the middle grade.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:39.000 In the middle grade, you reflect the highest Marine Corps standards of integrity, bearing and appearance.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000 You know what that means?
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000 That means 24 hours a day.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000 You're in the game.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000 That's what that means.
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.000 It means you're actively seeking self-improvement in wide-ranging areas.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000 You're trying to get better everywhere.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 That's middle ground, by the way.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.000 High ground.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Model Marine.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000 Frequently emulated.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000 Exemplary conduct, behavior and actions are tone setting.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000 An inspiration to subordinates peers and seniors.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:21.000 Remarkable dedication to improving self and others.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000 What are you trying to do to get better?
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000 I mean, I say that.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000 I said that on this podcast, in the day one, we're trying to get better.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000 What are you doing, actually?
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000 What's the activity?
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000 Because in other words, you see here a lot of this is action, action, action, words into action.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000 I'd be as an actions, skills into action.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000 I was going back and forth with a guy that I did some work with for echelon front.
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000 And I work with him quite a few years ago overseas.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000 And we still text back and forth from time to time.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:03.000 And he, I said, hey, because he was telling me some of the notes he had taken.
00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000 And I said, send me some of the notes.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:12.000 And he, for the first note he sent me, was, you can't think things better.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:19.000 It's a solid piece of advice.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Because he's one of these guys that that was a thinker, right?
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000 Big thinker.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000 And I'm all about thinking, you know, let's develop our brain.
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Let's develop our mind power.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000 Let's think about things. Let's be thoughtful. That's fine.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000 But you can't think things better.
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000 They're not going to get better unless you actually apply the skills.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000 Skills into action.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000 Faut into action.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000 Next, ensuring well-being of subordinates.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000 The genuine interest in the well-being of Marines.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000 Enhances subordinates ability to concentrate focus on mission accomplishment.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000 Concern for family readiness is inherent.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:13.000 The importance placed on welfare of subordinates is based on the belief that Marines take care of their own.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:19.000 Low end of the spectrum deals confidently with issues pertinent to subordinate welfare
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000 and recognizes suitable courses of action that supports subordinates well-being.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000 Applies available resources allowing subordinates to effectively concentrate on the mission.
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000 At a minimum, you're absolutely taken care of your people.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Middle grade instills and or reinforces a sense of responsibility among
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000 Junior Marines for themselves and their subordinates.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000 Actively, fosteres the development of and uses support system for subordinates
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000 which improve their ability to contribute to unit mission accomplishment.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Efforts to enhance subordinate welfare improve the unit's ability to accomplish their mission.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000 People don't think about that fact.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000 The people that are actually accomplishing the mission are people.
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:03.000 If those people aren't ready to perform because even neglected them,
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000 you're not going to be able to accomplish the mission.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000 High grade.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Noticeably enhances subordinates well-being, resulting in measurable increase in unit effectiveness.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000 Maximizes unit and base resources to provide subordinates with the best support available.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000 Proactive approach serves to energize unit members to take care of their own.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000 They're by correcting potential problems before they can hinder subordinates effectiveness.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Why'd be recognized for techniques and policies that produce results and build morale?
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:41.000 Builds strong family atmosphere, puts motto, mission first,
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Marines always into action.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000 Boom.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Last section for leadership.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000 Communication skills.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:04.000 The efficient transmission and receipt of thoughts and ideas that enable and enhance leadership.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000 Equal importance given to listening, speaking, writing, and critical reading skills.
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000 Interactive allowing one to perceive problems and situations,
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:22.000 provide concise guidance and express complex ideas in a form easily understood by everyone.
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:30.000 Allows subordinates to ask questions, raise issues, and concerns, and venture opinions.
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000 Contributes to a leader's ability to motivate as well as counsel.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000 Minimal.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000 Skilled and receiving in conveying information communicates effectively in performance adudies.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000 That's a minimum.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000 Above average, middle grade.
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:58.000 Clearly articulates thoughts and ideas verbally and in writing.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000 Let's think about that.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Middle ground.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000 Do you know how hard it is for people to clearly articulate thoughts and ideas verbally?
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000 An idea is verbally and in writing.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:17.000 It is a skill you need to work on all the time.
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000 By the way, this gets you a middle grade here.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Communication in all forms is accurate, intelligent, concise, and timely.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:36.000 Those standards accurate, intelligent, concise, and timely.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:42.000 Communicates with clarity and verb ensuring understanding of intent or purpose,
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.000 encourages and considers the contributions of others.
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000 High grade.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000 Here we go.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000 Highly developed facility in verbal communication.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000 Adept in composing written documents of the highest quality.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000 Combines presence and verbal skills which in gender, confidence and achieve understanding
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000 irrespective of setting, situation or size of group addressed.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Displays an intuitive sense of when and how to listen.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000 So.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000 Read, write, speak, listen and do it all the time.
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000 If you're in a leadership position or you want to be in one.
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000 The reading part, people asked me what I learned in college.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.000 One of the most important things that I learned in college was, I was an English major.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000 This is why I was an English major by the way, because I recognized when I was at a
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000 Seal team as a young officer that one of the most important things I was going to be
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000 dealing with was communicating with other humans.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000 And I needed to have good command of the English language and of reading and of writing
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000 the English language.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:12.000 But when I had to decipher Shakespeare and I took a lot of Shakespeare and you realize that
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000 you don't know what words mean and you realize that you don't understand the sentence
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.000 construction and you what you realize is that you have to break them down and go through
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000 them and figure it out.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000 So when I would get the rules of engagement from up the chain of command five years later
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000 and I didn't understand them because they were using words. I didn't know I said, okay,
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000 what I need to do is look these up.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000 Read it, find out some substitute words, make sense of it,
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000 look up the definition of what they're specifically talking about and go from there
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000 because when you first if you just open up Shakespeare and you don't understand something,
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000 what do you do? You say it's stupid.
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000 When somebody writes a rules of engagement and there's words in there and you don't understand
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000 if you don't understand how to parse things apart and look up definitions and
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000 you can't be humble enough to recognize that there's some things that you don't know.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000 Well, then all you do is go, this is stupid.
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000 Check communications.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000 The next thing, no one really probably thinks that this is going to be in here for
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000 the Marine Corps. The next section you're getting great on as grated on as a Marine is intellect
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000 and wisdom.
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000 There are things people in the military is a bunch of knuckle draggers.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000 Think it's all about brawn.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000 But there you go, intellect and wisdom.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000 Professional military education, PME, committed to intellectual growth in ways beneficial
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000 to the Marine Corps. Increases breadth and depth of war fighting and leadership
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000 aptitude.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000 Resources include resident schools, professional qualifications and certification processes,
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000 non-resident and other extension courses, civilian educational institutional coursework,
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000 a personal reading program that includes but is not limited to selections from the
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000 common-on's reading list.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:15.000 Participation in discussion groups and military societies and involvement in learning through new technologies.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000 You got to get in the game right there.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000 Got to get educated.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000 Here's low end.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000 Maintains currency and required military skills and related developments.
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000 Has completed or is enrolled in appropriate level of PME for grade and level of experience.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000 Recognizes and understands new and creative approaches to service issues,
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:42.000 remains abreast of contemporary concepts and issues.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.000 Middle grade PME outlook expands beyond MOS and required education.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000 So you're not even worried about your own job.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000 You've got that covered. Now you're going outside of what your job is.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000 Develops and follows a comprehensive personal program, which includes broadened professional reading
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000 and or academic coursework advances new concepts and ideas.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000 And here's your high end.
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000 Dedicated to lifelong learning.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:17.000 As a result of active and continuous efforts widely recognized as an intellectual leader in professionally related topics.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000 Makes time for study and takes advantage of all resources and programs.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000 Introduces new and creative approaches to service issues.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.000 Engages in a broad spectrum of forums and dialogues.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.000 So this is never going to stop. You've got to keep feeding your brain.
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000 The next thing you're getting graded on an intellect and wisdom decision making ability.
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000 Viable and timely problem solution.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000 Contributing elements are judgment and decisiveness.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000 Decisions reflect the balance between an optimal solution and a satisfactory,
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000 workable solution that generates tempo.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000 So there's a good dichotomy for you. Optimal decision on one side.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000 Workable decision that can keep you moving on the other side.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000 You've got to balance that dichotomy.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000 Decisions are made within the context of the commanders established intent and the goal of mission accomplishment.
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000 So of course you're trying to support the commanders intent.
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000 Inticipation, mental agility, intuition and success are inherent.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:34.000 This is not the first time they brought up intuition in here. How you develop intuition, experience, wisdom, reading,
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000 low end.
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000 Low end makes sound decisions leading to mission accomplishment.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000 That's the minimum. The minimum is to make sound decisions.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000 Actively collects and evaluates information in ways alternative alternatives to achieve timely results.
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000 Confidently approaches problems, accepts responsibility for outcomes.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000 Middle grade demonstrates mental agility.
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:07.000 Effectively prioritizes and solves multiple complex problems. This prioritizes next to you.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.000 Analytical abilities enhanced by experience, education and intuition.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000 Inticipates problems and implements viable long-term solutions.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.000 Steadfast willing to make difficult decisions.
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000 That's a high bar for middle grade. High grade.
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:36.000 Wildly recognized and sought after to resolve the most critical complex problems.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000 Seldom matched analytical and intuitive abilities.
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:50.000 Accurately for sees unexpected problems and arrives at well-time decisions despite fog and friction.
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000 Completely confident approach to all problems.
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:05.000 Masterfully strikes a balance between the desire for perfect knowledge and greater tempo.
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:11.000 Wildly recognized to solve problems.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000 This little line here accurately for sees unexpected problems and arrives at well-time decisions despite fog and friction.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000 Pass up big ass, right there. You've got to be in the game.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000 You've got to be in the game to get to that level.
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000 Last thing you're getting great on on for in-elect wisdom is judgment.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000 The discretionary aspect of decision-making draws in core values, knowledge and personal experience to make wise choices.
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000 Comprehends the consequences of contemplated courses of action.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:56.000 Minimum grade. Majority of judgments are measured, circumspect, relevant and correct.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000 Minimum.
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:07.000 The middle grade decisions are consistent and uniformly correct, tempered by consideration of their consequences.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Abel to identify, isolate and assess relevant factors in the decision-making process.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000 Opinion sought by others.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000 Subborn it's personally personal interest in favor of impartiality.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000 In the high-end decisions reflect exceptional insight and wisdom beyond this marine experience.
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:42.000 Council sought by all, often an arbiter, consistent, superior judgment inspires the confidence of seniors.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:56.000 So that's how you get graded on intellect and wisdom. And actually the last thing that they grade you on is they actually grade you on how well you evaluate your other Marines.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:05.000 The extent to which this officer serving as a reporting official conducted or required others to conduct accurate, uninflated and timely evaluations.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000 This is the last thing you get graded on.
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000 And they go through, you have a low end, it's like you did a good job.
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000 The high-end is you do an outstanding job, but they're grading you on how well you grade.
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000 And then you get to the last page, which is where you have the Christmas tree, the Eagle Globe and Anchor Christmas tree.
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.000 Comparative assessment, provide a comparative assessment of potential by placing an X in the appropriate box.
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:42.000 In marking the comparison consider all the Marines of this grade whose professional abilities are known to you personally.
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000 And then you go through that tree, the unqualified, unsatisfactory, a qualified Marine.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.000 One of the many highly qualified professionals who formed the majority of this grade, one of the few exceptionally qualified Marines.
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:07.000 And then you get to the top, the singular Marine at the top, who is the eminently qualified Marine.
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000 The eminently qualified Marine.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000 And that's what I think makes this interesting.
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000 Is to consider that statement, eminently qualified.
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:35.000 And think about where you're at.
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000 And you're not a top, I'm not a top, none of us are at the top, who can be.
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000 But what are we striving to be?
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:59.000 What are we striving to be? Are we striving to be the most eminently qualified human being that we can be?
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:08.000 Do you even know what that means? Do you even have those thoughts in your head?
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000 I'm guessing you don't, I barely do.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:20.000 I know I've had vague thoughts. I know I had definitions that floated around my head of what I was trying to be.
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.000 What I'm trying to be today. But why aren't those solid? Why aren't they?
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000 I was thinking about this. I was talking to Dave Burke.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:41.000 Yeah, good deal, Dave. And I was like, hey, we need to build this.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:48.000 You're basically an evaluation system for humans.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000 To become eminently qualified as a human. What does that look like?
01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:03.000 Not only to grave yourself, but to actually know what you are trying to be.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000 Dave and I will work on that. So stand by to get some.
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:16.000 And until until we do get that out, then think about.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000 Think about. Are there areas that you know?
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000 What the goal is that you're walking around thinking that you deserve a five point of.
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000 But you really actually. You really actually deserve two.
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000 I know I do that.
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000 Yes, right? Yes, I'm thinking I'm good. I'm walking around.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:48.000 I'm thinking I'm running everything right. I'm thinking I come correct.
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000 But the reality is I don't.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.000 And the reality is you have that little moving goal post in your head.
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000 You move it around a little bit.
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000 You give yourself a little bit more slack one day than you tighten it up because you're feeling good the next day.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000 You can go back and off a little bit more. But as far as you're concerned, that's a five.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000 Oh, right. You're there. You're in there.
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:19.000 And the reality is I don't measure up the way I should be measuring up on a daily basis on an hourly basis.
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:27.000 Who's grading me? Who's lying to me? You know who is me?
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:37.000 But until we clarify what the aim is, what the goal is and what those standards are, how am I supposed to hold myself accountable to those standards when they don't even exist?
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000 So I'm going to make them exist. I'm going to put them in. I'm going to put them on paper.
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000 We're going to come up with that eminently qualified human being. What that looks like.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000 Because we all got all got ideas floating around up there.
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000 Yeah.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000 Well, I'm going to bring it. I'm going to apply that.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000 Put it in the action. Put it in the action.
01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:03.000 Right. Are we doing everything that we could be doing? Everything that we should be doing. Are we cutting corners? Are we slack enough?
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000 We're giving ourselves a five point. Oh, when we should be at best cracking a two.
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000 Daily. How much are we leaving on the table every day? That's a question for you.
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000 Right. How much are we leaving on the table? How much are you saying? I know what. I can just leave that there. It's fine.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000 How much how many things just do you accept this collateral damage?
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000 Like something goes wrong. Like one thing goes wrong.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000 So there's just collateral damage. Other things are just going to fall by the way. And you're good with it.
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000 You're good with it.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000 Something you, you know, you hurt my knee. Oh, co. Guess what? I'm going to eat a donut.
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000 Yeah.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000 Is that where we're at?
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000 Is that what we're at?
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Or is there collateral damage? Oh, work was hard.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:55.000 Therefore, I'm going to, you know, treat my family. Not going to have a good family quality time tonight.
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000 Collateral damage. Because they, what do you expect from me?
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000 Yeah.
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000 Right. Where is the collateral damage? Why are we allowing this collateral damage?
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:12.000 Well, part of the reason I'm telling you that we allow this collateral damage is because we're not effectively grading ourselves.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000 And even worse than that. We don't even know what standard we're trying to achieve.
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000 No one's even told us the minimum standard.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000 Okay. So why is your life going marginal right now? Why are you doing okay? Why am I doing okay right now?
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000 Well, it's because I have some vague idea.
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000 I have, I kind of know I'm heading in the right general direction.
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000 That's not good enough to get maximum.
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000 It's not good enough to be amin' itly qualified.
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000 It doesn't work.
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000 You have to step it up.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:53.000 You have to, you have to have the unmitigated daily discipline in all things.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:02.000 And that's hard. It's hard for one day never mind every single day.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000 So I'm gonna make this evaluation.
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000 David and I are gonna make it.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000 I'll get it out to y'all.
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:15.000 And until then, I'll try and get it turned around because quick is possible at least some kind of a.
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000 What is it called an early version of beta test?
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000 Is that what it's called?
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000 Oh sure. I think.
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000 No, like the technology.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Right right right right.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Yeah.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000 Yeah.
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000 We're gonna beta test.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000 We'll try and get something out there quick.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000 And until then, start looking at yourself.
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000 As usual, your strengths, your weaknesses,
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000 and start trying to see where you can improve.
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Start moving towards the goal of becoming the
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.000 eminently qualified human being.
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000 To where we're at.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:55.000 And I think that is all I've got for tonight.
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000 So echo Charles, what do you got?
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000 Oh, I got.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000 I know.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000 I know we're trying to step up.
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000 Yep.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000 We got thoughts.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000 Well, yeah.
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000 So you and you actually mentioned it in like right there at the end there.
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000 Where all these little.
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000 Oh, not little.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000 But all these evaluations are like, you know, you do this consistently and all this stuff.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000 It's.
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000 So there's two kind of parts to that when I think you.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.000 You.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000 You have to do all these good things, right?
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000 To be the minimum or to be the, you know, you,
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000 you can't even really be in the group if you're not in the minimum, right?
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000 But you gotta do those things every day.
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000 Like you have to essentially be known for these things.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000 Yeah.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000 So so how we get jammed up, I think, when we when we are conscious of like how good am I doing in XYZ area of my life,
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000 whatever.
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000 And if it's something that you're working on a lot of times we don't get the accurate evaluation.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000 To ourselves because we'll do, we'll do it really good one day.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000 And we'll do it really good two days.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000 And I'm playing tang.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000 I'm pretty good at this.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000 So I'm going to go ahead and give myself like a for whatever.
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000 But meanwhile, you only did it twice.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000 Me, you know, in the whole week you did it twice.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000 You're so happy because it's this big change because you usually do it zero.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 So you're like, hey, I got this.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000 Your minimum bar was so low that you think you're crushing it.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Oh yeah.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Oh yeah.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000 Two times.
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.000 And you're just because in your mind you kind of are comparatively.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000 Be careful.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000 Like if you have a standard and stuff then you can act more accurately.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000 But we don't have standard.
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000 So in your mind it feels like,
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000 Oh, I got this.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000 I got it.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.000 I got it.
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000 I'm a for now.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000 You know, you should be a one.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000 I'm a for now.
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000 So meanwhile, you're not a for you're actually still a one.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000 Yeah.
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000 Really?
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000 You think you're you.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000 And there's also there's also this.
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000 There's also and I and I talked to Dave about this a little bit.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000 There's a there's a short term grade and there's a long term grade because check this out.
01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000 Let's say you let's say you never worked out before.
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000 And you've been watching video games and he don't nuts and and just, you know,
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000 in in bad physical shape.
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000 Yeah.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000 Your grade.
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000 Your overall grade for physical fitness is whatever.
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000 It's a one point up.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000 It's a low.
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000 It's a low stick and go.
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000 But daily.
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000 If you get up, okay, look, look, I can only run one mile and it's going to take me 20 minutes.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000 Twenty two minutes.
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000 I'm going to do it.
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:18.000 And then I'm going to do as many push ups as I can, which is 23 by the way.
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000 If I did a one mile run in 22 minutes and did 23 pushups, that would,
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000 I would get a one point.
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000 Oh, for the day.
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000 But this individual that's been on the couch living a sedentary lifestyle.
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000 If he does that, guess what?
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000 He's going to get him.
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000 He's going to get a high degree.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000 He's going to get a four point eight for the day.
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000 Hmm.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000 So then he's leading himself in the right direction.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.000 Yeah.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000 So not only is that not only do you have, this is one of the problems.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000 And again, this is something I told Dave, I'm like, listen.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000 A once a buy annual twice a year, every six months, you're getting a grade.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000 That doesn't help you.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000 What you need to look at yourself every day.
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000 You need to look at yourself every day and say, did I truly live this way?
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000 Live the way I should be living today.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000 Yeah.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000 And then those standards need to be clear.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000 And then you need to apply them to your life.
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000 Yeah.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000 I might even say like that example you just gave.
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000 So the guy who's sitting on the couch all the time, whatever, or every day.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000 And now he's doing he's working out every day.
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000 But his physical fitness standard technically still loves to do that.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000 Yeah.
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000 Maybe another area of evaluation is like, you know, improvement or you know, how should you say,
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000 or back when you're young, you know, they give you that most improved kind of thing.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000 Yeah.
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000 Maybe that could be part of it.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000 I think it will be covered by the daily track, the daily track.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000 Like, okay, you got a four point out today.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000 What you're ever trying to know, my average for the last one.
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000 My running average for 30 days is I'm hitting a 3.9 physical fitness.
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000 Yeah.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000 I mean, I'm doing something every day.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000 I'm pushing the envelope.
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000 I'm improving.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000 Now my overall score is moved from a one to a one point two.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000 Yeah.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000 Because I'm in a little bit better shape, but it's still not where it needs to be.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000 Yeah.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000 That's what that can crush some people.
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000 Right?
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000 If someone goes over the one point two, I'm never going to improve.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000 I've been through three months.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000 No, guess what?
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000 What'd you get today?
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000 What'd you do today?
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000 Same thing opposite, right?
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000 The opposite can happen, where someone thinks, well, I did something.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000 I did something today, so I'm good.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000 Man, no.
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000 No.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000 And the other collateral damages, I did good physical fitness today.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000 So I'm going to take tomorrow off.
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000 Or I'm going to eat a, you know, a crappy meal.
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000 Yeah.
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000 I'm going to get that pizza together.
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000 Yeah.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000 Right?
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000 We don't want that.
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000 I say, we, I mean, me.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000 And that why is that?
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.000 Because we've, we've, we've created this, this, this,
01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000 pliable standard in our head that we move around based on our little feelings.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000 Yeah.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000 But, but this does this won't allow for it.
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000 Yeah.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000 They need to keep yourself in check.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Yeah.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000 You need to keep yourself in check at all times.
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000 And the reason you need to keep your check, self-in-check at all times.
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000 You need to impose discipline on your life because you will end up in a better situation.
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000 That you will end up in a better situation.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000 You will end up with more freedom.
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000 This is where you're going to end up.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000 You know, people, you, you talk about regret.
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000 Right?
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000 Oh, you go talk to people when they're, when they're dying on their deathbed.
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000 And they're, they're, they're regret things they didn't do.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000 There's nothing I can imagine you're going to regret more than when you look back at your life and you said,
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000 You know, I didn't achieve what I could have achieved.
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000 Yeah.
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000 And there's only one way to maximize your achievement.
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000 And that's the daily discipline, daily discipline.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000 And again, what we're talking about achievement, what are we talking about?
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000 I'm not just talking about, I've worked more than you.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000 I made more money than you.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000 I produced more, I sold more cars.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000 And that's not what I'm talking about.
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000 I'm talking about what, what is your, what is your achievement?
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000 Yeah.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000 What is that you're trying to do?
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000 I spent a bunch of time with my family and raised great kids.
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000 Okay, that's what you want to do.
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000 Put that on paper so you know what that looks like.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000 Maybe there is a financial there.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000 It should be a financial aspect to it because you need to pay.
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000 You need to have a roof over your head.
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000 You need to be able to feed your kids.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000 So you certainly should have a job of vocation aspect to grading yourself.
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000 Are you doing what you should be doing that work?
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000 Because if you're working hard at work, guess what?
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000 You're going to get promoted eventually.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000 Or you're going to find it.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000 You're going to improve your skills to a point where you're more valuable.
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000 And you can go find a different job somewhere else.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000 So that's got to be in there.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000 Because if what we allow ourselves to do is show up at work every day and just do what we need to do to get by.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000 I guess what, you never leave in that job.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000 You'll be doing that thing forever.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000 So it's physical fitness.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000 It's what you're eating.
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000 Your fuel systems that you're putting into your body.
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000 It's the family, the effort.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000 What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children?
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000 What are you doing?
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000 What are you doing to improve the skill sets of your children?
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000 Are you spending 20 minutes teaching them new vocabulary words so that they can articulate better?
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000 So they can become a better leader when they get older.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000 Are you doing that?
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000 Is that a big ask as a dad?
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000 As a mom?
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000 Are you doing it?
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:40.000 Have you showed them how to escape a guillotine?
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000 Have you?
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Maybe you should.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000 Could you get caught in a guillotine?
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.000 That's the street fight.
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000 Right?
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000 Street fight.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000 Gettings are common.
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.000 So have you, does your kid know how to escape a guillotine in a street fight?
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000 How much is it?
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000 How long will it take?
01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000 You got to teach them today that takes 15 minutes, but you got to drill it.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000 Got to drill it every day until they kind of understand it.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000 So what have you invested in your kids today?
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000 What's the minimum standard?
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000 Now you could think to yourself, well you know, I got my kid an iPad for Christmas.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000 That was an awesome gift, so I'm pretty much good to go.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000 Yeah.
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000 As a dad.
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000 Right?
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000 Does your kid care about that iPad compared to,
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000 Are you fast forward three years where your kid's got an incredible vocabulary?
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000 And can defend guillotines for right?
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000 So how much of you invested in your family?
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000 So these are the kind of things that we can set a moving goal post,
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000 Where you can set a moving goal post that says,
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000 I buy a if you get your kid an iPad with some apps on it, you're a good dad.
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000 That's a moving goal post.
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000 Hey, if you can get your kid an iPad and they can get some educational stuff.
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000 You feel pretty good about a good job.
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000 Is that a moving goal post?
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000 Yes it is.
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000 Because what they really need to know is have a better vocabulary.
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:01.000 What they really need is interaction with you as a human being.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000 So they can interact with other human beings in a more complete way.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000 That's what we're doing.
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000 So you got your physical, you got your, okay mental.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000 What are you, how much have you read today?
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000 And I'm not talking about reading somebody's freaking Instagram post.
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000 That doesn't count.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000 Get negative credit for that.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000 You're getting dumber when you do that.
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000 So what are you doing?
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000 How many words did you learn today?
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000 And by the way, this is brain maintenance too.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000 Because if you're not trying to learn new things,
01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000 then your brain is deteriorating, just like your body will.
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000 So you got that aspect.
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000 What about your creative output?
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000 What have you done in that capacity?
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000 Did you write us?
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000 Did you draw a picture?
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000 Did you write a story?
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000 Did you come up with a guitar riff that kind of rocks?
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000 Did you?
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000 Right?
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000 Did you?
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000 Because you may or may not have.
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000 My guess is you didn't.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000 So what?
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000 Have you done that today?
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000 And we're, and by the way, if you think,
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000 Oh, I took a cool picture for Instagram,
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:15.000 and I'm kind of giving myself artistic credit for output right there.
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000 No.
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000 No.
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000 So, and then you start looking at all this stuff.
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000 And you start adding it together, your time that you've invested in your work,
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000 and your family, and your friends, and you're trying to teach your kids something,
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000 and you're trying to read something, and all of a sudden you're looking,
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000 you say, well, I don't have much time.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000 And then you look at yourself and say, wait a second,
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000 why did my time go to the day?
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000 What grade do I get today for time management?
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000 Yeah.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000 That's a big one.
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000 Because did I spend time doing things that I got negative value?
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000 Never mind, break even.
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000 Actually, negative value.
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000 Yeah.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000 And we don't have a grading system.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000 We don't know what we're aiming at.
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000 We don't know what the potential is.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000 Because that's what's cool about this.
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000 You read these definitions of high end,
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000 the outstanding, the eminently qualified Marine.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000 That is an unachievable human.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000 Yeah.
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000 It's an unachievable Marine.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000 You will not be that good.
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000 You cannot hold all those categories.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000 But let me tell you something that is no reason
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000 to not aspire
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000 to become the most eminently qualified human being
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000 that you can become.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:25.000 Just because it's an impossible path.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Just because it's a path with no end to it.
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000 Just because you'll never reach the top of the mountain.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000 Ever, you will not.
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000 You cannot.
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000 Mmm.
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000 Guess what?
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000 That is no reason to stop.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000 Guess what?
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000 Do you get to?
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000 You're going to get tapped out.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000 There's always going to be someone that can tap you out.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000 Always.
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000 Or 100% of the time.
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000 The best guys in the world get tapped out.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000 Yeah.
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000 The best guys in the world get tapped out.
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000 Buchetcha.
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000 Hot, hot your gracy.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000 Buchetcha is the best guy in the world.
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000 What happens?
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000 He goes in ghee and loses to hot your gracy.
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000 Taped out.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000 Submitted.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Why is that?
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.000 Because somebody's always.
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000 And what happened to Roger Gracy?
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000 By the way, when he fought Tim Kennedy.
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000 He got beat down.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000 So there's always.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000 You're never going to get to the top of the mountain.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:22.000 But that is not a reason to not stop climbing.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000 Just because you're not going to reach the top of the mountain doesn't mean you stop climbing.
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000 No.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.000 Actually you climb herger.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000 You see where you can get.
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000 But if you don't know what you're climbing.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:38.000 If you don't understand the mountain, if you can't see the summit, you don't know where to climb.
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000 And then you just look around and go, well, I'm going to slide down.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000 Because it takes physical and mental exertion to move up the mountain.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000 And if I don't even know where the top is, I'm just going to, I can't tell where I am.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000 I can't tell if I'm halfway up the mountain or the quarter with the mountain.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000 I can't tell if I'm close to the top.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000 Bottom top.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000 It can't tell.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000 So there's enough reason for me just to sit around and do nothing.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000 Break out the donuts.
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000 Not.
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000 The.
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000 Okay, so the way you started this was with your Navy experience.
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000 Yes.
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000 This is far as the valuations go.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.000 And it, okay, so this is essentially what it, what it kind of translated to me, what it was.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:19.000 In the Navy, the one that you were talking about was like everyone expected to get the high, the, the, the perfect score.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:19.000 Right.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000 And now we started the standard and then in the Marine Corps one, it's kind of the opposite.
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000 Well, no, the Navy once started off.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000 When I first got in the Navy, basically everyone was a four point.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 Oh, yeah.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:28.000 Yeah.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000 Then they changed it because you need the force rank and I don't know when the Marine Corps or if they made that change,
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000 but but they did because that's the way it is now.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000 They're force ranked for sure.
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000 Yeah.
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:44.000 Okay, so the end of the point is just the two different standards, like common standards, right?
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:52.000 Where, you know, because you get this in other places to where it's like, oh, you know, it's just a, just here's your quarterly valuation and I just put force, you know,
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000 because I don't have any complaints about you kind of this.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000 It doesn't necessarily reflect how dope you really are.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000 Or how dope you could be.
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000 Yes, exactly right.
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000 So it's just more of like, okay, so the ceiling is pretty low is what it is.
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000 By like a common like perception is far as the standard goes.
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000 Then you got to have the opposite where it's like, oh, we all know, no, no, it's going to get a five.
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000 Like we all just know that.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000 So we're, we're just kind of doing the best we can kind of thing.
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000 And in that way is better for obvious reasons, but at the end of the day, it's like, when you say, oh, yeah, you can literally be like you're topping out.
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000 Because as you get better and better, it's harder to get better and better.
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000 Yes, you know, yes.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:34.000 So if, but you won't even get to those upper levels,
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000 if that ceiling was so low and you're ripping four is all day, they're all year or whatever.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000 So man, he's the, he's the place game super Mario Brothers.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000 You've heard that super Mario Brothers.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.000 I've heard of it, but I've never, I've never, I've never, I've never, I've never played one single second of that particular video game.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000 All right.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Thank you, Bill. Okay.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000 I played Halo one time for about three minutes with some of the guys that wasn't my seal,
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000 but I didn't see it on the ceiling and then I just, I think was after.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000 Thought it was, they were really good at it, they murdered me a bunch of different ways.
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000 And then I said, well, this is stupid, it's a video game I don't care if I want to go grapple.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000 Yeah.
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:19.000 Well, that part is, I would say that that's true, but the, the point still is consistent.
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000 So super Mario Brothers, it's, okay, it's super Mario.
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000 There's a bunch of Mario Brothers.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000 This is what it's super Mario Brothers.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000 And original Nintendo Entertainment system, I don't want to say 19.
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000 I understand.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.000 I'm not in school.
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:40.000 So super Mario Brothers had four worlds, sorry, eight worlds, four levels, each world.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000 So 32 levels.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000 And you have an opportunity at various points in some levels to hit the warp, like the warp zone.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000 So you go down a pipe in its skips, like all these levels.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:59.000 Right. So you could, you could essentially get through the game in maybe like, I don't know, six or eight levels.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000 Okay. If you worked, right.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000 But if you chose not to warp, you would have to go through all 32 levels.
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000 So I used to be able to go through all 32 levels, never dying one single time.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000 Like I got really, really good at that.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000 You're, for those of you that just listening and not seeing this on video, echo looks super proud of that last statement.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000 I mean, I was a little bit embarrassed for it, and it's cool. Anyway.
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000 Okay. So levels, never dying.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.000 Here's why that's, here's why that's significant though. It's far too far.
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000 Everybody's got this because you can easily pass the game, save the princess by just warping.
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000 And it's still real hard, but you got, you know, you only go through a few levels.
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000 Compared to if you go through all the levels voluntarily.
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:46.000 So once you save the princess by warping, it's like cool now you got to go through all the levels.
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:51.000 But if you can do that without dying, that's like that's super high level.
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000 Right. It's far super Mario Brothers goes.
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000 So it's basically so comfortable.
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000 What's your point? So go back to this two standards.
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000 Go back to the two standards.
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000 If you go for the standards like, oh yeah, everyone gets a kind of a 4.0 kind of thing.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000 That's like passing the passing the game by warping.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000 It's true. Like man, you pass the game in one man damn. That's good.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000 That's good by any standard really. You know, I can't complain about that.
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.000 But you got to open up the standard a little bit more.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000 Go through all 32 levels. Then without dying, then you do it as quick as you can.
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000 Kind of think. And if that standard kind of allows for all that, where you can't reach the top of the
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000 Like the standard isn't saving the princess.
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000 Standard is like something way greater. You seem to say.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.000 So it allows you to get better and be evaluated on that on that elevation.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000 Well, still not like capping out at a certain level. You seem to say.
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000 So what you got to do as far as the evaluation process goes. Okay, bro.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:49.000 I'm telling you. I'm telling you. Look to Super Mario.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000 But there is this thing they discovered. It was like a glitch in the game where you could like go to this one level
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000 And do the thing with a turtle shell and keep jumping on it and get like a thousand men.
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000 Which is kind of a step backwards in a way.
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000 But let's just say no.
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:12.000 Okay. How much time have you spent playing video games?
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000 Well, imagine what you could have done with your life.
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000 Yeah. Well, keep playing guitar. You could have played.
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000 You know, instruments could have mastered chess.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000 You could have spoken another language.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000 Is that you're over here talking about how you did 32 levels in one minute by the way.
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000 This is a really low grade.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000 Well, come up with a system. Your grade is going to be low.
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000 Yes, as far as the achievement goes, yes, very low.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000 But as far as an evaluation process did all that translate it highly respect you.
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000 Did J. Charles go ahead, man.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000 Did he kind of, yeah, something.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000 There you go.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000 Look at that. You finally got that respect you on.
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000 Keep in mind.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000 I was in fifth grade by the way. So, you know, a little bit different.
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000 Was that a humble brag? Like, why did 32 levels?
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000 By the way, I was all the fifth grade.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000 No, I think it was more of an aging thing. Actually, that wasn't a bragged all because in fifth grade.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000 You could have been learning the language.
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000 Yes, sir.
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.000 Yeah.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000 We're doing full-up. So, actually, it was doing full-ups in fifth grade.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000 That's legit.
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000 Yeah. Big-to.
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000 I thought check.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000 Well, okay.
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000 The lesson here is the bottom line.
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000 We are looking to step up.
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000 We are looking to two to become better.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000 Truly better.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000 So, what do you got for us? How can you help us get better?
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.000 Yeah.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000 To stay on the path. So, actually, that brings up a good point because we're on the path called
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000 Right?
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.000 You, we would ever, all on the path and saying, we're even saying we're on the path straight up,
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000 saying it.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000 But like, what is the path though?
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000 I mean, sure, there's some things.
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000 Yeah.
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000 You know, we can go through a Jiu-Jitsu, of course, as part of it.
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000 But you don't have any valuation kind of standard.
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000 So, you say it.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000 So, yeah, I think that'll be how action I'm really looking forward to it.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:55.000 Yeah.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.000 Be honest with you.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000 Yeah.
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000 On the last Jiu-Jitsu, yes.
01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000 That's on the path.
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000 Here's, okay.
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000 So, this will help us prep that at the very least prepare to be officially on the path
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000 and be evaluated.
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000 See, get a G.
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000 Yeah.
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:09.000 Right?
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000 Step one, get a G.
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000 Step one, B.
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000 Get a rash guard.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000 So, where do we get our Gs?
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000 We get a Gs from origin.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000 OriginMain.com.
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000 Best Gs in the world, factually, actually, the new Rift is at,
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000 Oh, that's all right.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000 That's right.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000 Rift is live.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.000 Rift.
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000 This is like, when you put a Rift G on and then go back to your old Gs.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000 Yeah.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.000 Like, I said this in the game.
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:30.000 Yeah.
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000 This is non-starter.
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000 You're going to be mad at your old G.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000 You're going to be trade your old G.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:41.000 You're going to wonder why anyone ever made a G, like they used to make them.
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000 Yeah.
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000 But then again, then you're going to, then if you choose, you can revisit or you can visit
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000 that video that Pete put out about like, you know, how amazing.
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000 Yeah.
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000 How amazing.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000 There's like, okay, that's why they didn't make it because what they went through to make
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000 it.
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.000 Yeah.
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000 And then as usual, we are standing on the shoulders of giants because you always look at the
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000 way things have evolved and you have to take those iterative steps.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000 No one just thinks of the iPhone.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Right.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000 Right.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000 And somebody had to make a bunch of other phones before that.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000 Oh, yeah.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000 And then even consider iPhone, like, right now, like, what is the newest one?
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000 I don't know.
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000 X or something.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000 Tanned.
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000 Right.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000 The X is the tan.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000 You don't know what I mean.
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000 No, I don't know.
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000 The one in six years from now is going to make this X tan one.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000 It'd be like, oh, that's the old school.
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000 You know, like, non evolved, meanderthal one.
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000 That's what's going to feel like.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000 That's what your old gui will feel like.
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000 Yes.
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000 A non evolved meanderthal gui.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000 Yeah.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000 And then put on the rift.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000 Oh, yeah.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000 So yeah, you can get the, you can get the guis.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000 You can get the rash cards.
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000 You can get other clothing.
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000 You can also get supplements, which right now I am taking a look at.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000 I am taking a ton of joint warfare.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000 Yeah, I heard many.
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000 Which is not that big of a deal.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000 Because let's face it.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000 I'm walking around.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000 You know, we're going to be fine.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000 It's not that big of a deal when people do feel like, oh, no, what happened?
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Don't worry.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000 Everything is fine.
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000 I did, however, up the joint warfare.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000 And continue the krill oil path.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000 But the, the joint warfare, you can feel it in there.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000 Can feel it like little micro nano robots in there.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000 Repairing stuff.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000 Yep.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000 Now, you have to, you know, I know it happened with your bicep.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000 But the last time I heard my other knee, it was a disaster.
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000 And this one is already.
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000 So, anyways, get your joint warfare.
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:45.000 I remember you, well, and, I mean, of course, I remember it because it was as
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000 recent as today where you're like, oh, I'm like, Wolverine.
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000 Wolverine.
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000 I feel so fast.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000 But I'm like, yeah, well, I dig it.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000 It's probably the joint warfare, but yeah, man.
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000 The joint warfare has to do something to do with it.
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000 But also, there's some, there's definitely, I definitely have been blessed with some sort of
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000 ability to, to heal up a little quicker.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000 Yeah, I'm not.
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000 Yeah, I think, yeah.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000 Thankfully, knock on wood.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000 That's what it seems like today.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000 Cool.
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000 Well, also we have milk, which is additional protein that happens to be delicious.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000 And tastes like a dessert straight up.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.000 So, it goes with that also where you kid milk.
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000 Same deal, just for the kids.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000 The same deal.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:33.000 But they have strawberry, where you kid milk, which is literally the best tasting thing in the
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000 world.
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000 Yeah.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000 That has strawberry flavor, because men is still my favorite.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:41.000 And we do have strawberry adult milk coming out.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000 I teeny that.
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000 And it is ridiculous.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000 What is T and E?
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000 Test an evaluate.
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000 So I got the little package in the mail.
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000 Yeah.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000 And it was so good.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000 So yeah, you can get that.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000 You know, also discipline.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000 And discipline go.
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.000 So discipline, if you are going to train jiu-jitsu, or you're going to do something that's
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000 going to require physical output.
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000 And at the same time, mental alertness.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000 So that's, for me, it was always about hey, pre-mission.
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.000 Because when you're on a mission, you have to be physically ready.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000 And you have to be mentally ready.
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000 You need both aspects.
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000 And so that's why we made discipline.
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000 So you're ready for those things.
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:32.000 And then also, we have discipline go, which is a capsule.
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:38.000 And the reason I made this is because sometimes I'm going to speak or I'm going to work with a company.
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000 I'm going to be in a boardroom all day.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000 And I want to bring my A game.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000 And I don't want to have to drink a whole beverage.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000 Because I don't need it at that time.
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000 So I talked to Pete Bryan.
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000 We took the elements from discipline, drink, put them into the capsule.
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000 So that way, if you need to bring your A game, you can get your discipline go.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000 And that will get you across the board.
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000 And so we'll a little bit of jocquawaite.
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.000 Yeah, it's like going to the original, the original T that jocquaw was into.
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000 Yeah.
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000 Just kind of, you know, white T it's, you know, at first, but now sort of a stable.
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000 It's like synonymous, you know, jocquawaite.
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000 Yeah, it's just, it's synonymous with good taste.
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000 It's synonymous with 8,000 pound deadlift.
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000 So there's that big time.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000 Also, the T is available at jocquaw store.
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000 Because yes, jocquaw has a store, which we already know.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000 But that's a good place to visit to stay in the game to represent while you're in the game.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:47.000 Sure.
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:52.000 If you want T shirts, we've got some lightweight hoodies rolling, rocking and rolling.
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000 Hmm.
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000 There are a lot of good evaluations in that one.
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000 No comment.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000 Yeah, because you haven't put one on yet.
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000 Because you haven't given me one.
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000 A lot well, you know, let's face it.
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000 You kind of deserve that one.
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000 And it's also changing minds of people who are originally,
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000 we're really signing off.
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000 It's special forces over here.
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000 I like it.
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000 It's great.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000 You know what?
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:17.000 Hey, the truth be told they came out really good.
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:20.000 Just even like the fit, the design, the date.
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000 There's someone that just gave out on the other night.
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000 Yes, there it is.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000 One of them, there's two of it.
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000 There's two.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.000 Okay.
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000 It's right.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000 You can get truckers hats.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000 Yeah, patches on there.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000 Yeah, much other stuff.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000 Yeah, bunch of cool stuff.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000 Yeah, if you want to jocquaw store.com, if you want to represent while you're on the path.
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000 While you're being evaluated, that might be one of the evaluation scenarios.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000 Well, you know, you're uniform.
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000 Come on.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.000 Anyway, I guess if someone's just a complete slob,
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.000 Yeah, then maybe they do need to step it up.
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000 Yeah, somebody, yeah.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000 Okay, maybe uniform will be judged, but I doubt it.
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000 Well, okay.
01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000 Well, don't be wearing a stinky guillo.
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000 Oh, no.
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000 That's a uniform violation big dime.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000 Yes, sir.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000 Oh, you didn't want to wash your gays.
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.000 So now we all have to suffer.
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.000 Yeah.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000 Yeah, you're going to get punished.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000 What if don't do that?
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000 Hey, the the rift key, the cool thing.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000 You can wash with your normal clothes.
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000 Yeah.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000 Because it's and it dry.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000 It's not like when you put a regular key in.
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000 And it's like you threw a 40 pound weight.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:34.000 You're washing your see.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000 Yeah.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000 Yeah, yeah.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:34.000 Because it'll bunch.
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000 That's all right.
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000 And it takes nine hours to dry, not the rift.
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000 The rift dries with your normal quick dry t-shirts.
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.000 Just about.
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000 Did you see the video Pete had when he's going into the fibers like he takes a while in fiber.
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000 And he's like breaking in.
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000 And it's hard to break.
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000 He puts the two and you can't even break it.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000 The whole gear is that.
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.000 Yeah.

01:47:56.30 --> 01:47:56.90 Sometimes.

01:47:58.54 --> 01:48:00.94 If you need a little, if everyone that looks for an alarm,
01:48:00.94 --> 01:48:02.54 it says, oh, really be great to have an alarm.

01:49:32.10 --> 01:49:37.10 And then there's the third book in the series, which is called Way the Warrior Kid,
01:49:37.10 --> 01:49:39.10 where there's a will.
01:49:39.10 --> 01:49:42.90 So that is now live for pre-order at this time.
01:49:42.90 --> 01:49:49.10 If you want it, order it now that way I can print enough copies for everyone.
01:49:49.10 --> 01:49:52.38 That's called the big pre-order that I used to make fun of my publisher.
01:49:52.38 --> 01:49:57.22 But guess who the publisher is now me so I have to know how many to print.
01:49:57.22 --> 01:50:02.62 So if you want it, order it now and it's going to come out May 28th.
01:50:02.62 --> 01:50:03.62 So there you go.
01:50:03.62 --> 01:50:05.86 Also, we have Mikey in the Dragons.
01:50:05.86 --> 01:50:09.86 This is a book to help kids figure out how to overcome fear.
01:50:09.86 --> 01:50:13.86 Sure, your kids could read some book where you could read some book to your little kid.
01:50:13.86 --> 01:50:21.86 That's about things that don't matter in the world or you could read them a book that helps them actually learn how to overcome their fears.
01:50:21.86 --> 01:50:22.86 That's Mikey in the Dragons.
01:50:22.86 --> 01:50:23.86 Great story.
01:50:23.86 --> 01:50:24.86 Awesome art.
01:50:24.86 --> 01:50:26.86 Very awesome.
01:50:26.86 --> 01:50:27.86 Yes.
01:50:27.86 --> 01:50:30.86 The Disponicals Freedom Field Manual.
01:50:30.86 --> 01:50:32.86 Give the gift of discipline.
01:50:32.86 --> 01:50:33.86 Yep.
01:50:33.86 --> 01:50:34.86 That's that's all there is to say.
01:50:34.86 --> 01:50:40.86 It's the book that's going to show people that you, it's going to show people the path.
01:50:40.86 --> 01:50:44.86 If you want that on audio form, then that's not on audible.
01:50:44.86 --> 01:50:48.86 It's on iTunes Amazon, music, Google Play and other MP3 platforms.
01:50:48.86 --> 01:50:50.86 Then you got extreme ownership, which I wrote with my brother,
01:50:50.86 --> 01:50:58.86 Lave Babin, where we took the leadership lessons that we learned on the battlefield and explain how those can be applied to your business and life.
01:50:58.86 --> 01:51:03.86 And one of those lessons in that book is called the Decautomy Leadership.
01:51:03.86 --> 01:51:09.86 The Decautomy Leadership seemed to be as we continue to work with businesses, companies, leaders around the world.
01:51:09.86 --> 01:51:15.86 We found that the biggest problem that they had was balancing the Decautomy of leadership.
01:51:15.86 --> 01:51:23.86 And when you can't balance the Decautomy of leadership, the multiple Decautomy of leadership, when you can't balance them, they derail your whole team.
01:51:23.86 --> 01:51:31.86 So get extreme ownership and get yourself the Decautomy of leadership so that you can understand how to truly apply these things effectively.
01:51:31.86 --> 01:51:37.86 Eshelon Front, that's my leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership.
01:51:37.86 --> 01:51:44.86 We have an outstanding team of outstanding guys, Lave Babin, J.P. to Nell, Dave Burke, Mike Cochran,
01:51:44.86 --> 01:51:49.86 or sorry Flynn Cochran, Mike Surreli, Mike Bima, and now Jason Gardner.
01:51:49.86 --> 01:51:59.86 If you need help at your company with any problem, because every problem that you have in your business is a leadership problem.
01:51:59.86 --> 01:52:03.86 That's what we do. We solve problems through leadership, Eshelon Front, dot com.
01:52:03.86 --> 01:52:07.86 We have the muster coming up Chicago, 2324th.
01:52:07.86 --> 01:52:12.86 We haven't pulled this sold out switch yet, but we're going to it's almost sold out.
01:52:12.86 --> 01:52:19.86 September 19th and 20th. That's May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver.
01:52:19.86 --> 01:52:23.86 And then December 4th and 5th in Sydney, extreme ownership dot com.
01:52:23.86 --> 01:52:28.86 If you want to register do it quickly, because all of them are going to sell out.
01:52:28.86 --> 01:52:36.86 EF online, this is for those of you that can't make it to a muster, or you can't bring your whole company to a muster, because it's expensive.
01:52:36.86 --> 01:52:42.86 That's what we made EF online. This is online interactive leadership training.
01:52:42.86 --> 01:52:50.86 It's me and it's everyone on the Eshelon Front team training leadership through technology.
01:52:50.86 --> 01:52:55.86 It's it's available direct to consumer if you're just one person you want to get in the game, or you got a company.
01:52:55.86 --> 01:53:02.86 You can get it through enterprise, but if you want to check it out go to ef online dot com.
01:53:02.86 --> 01:53:11.86 And of course, on top of that, we have EF over watch where we're taking leaders, proven leaders from spec ops and from combat aviation,
01:53:11.86 --> 01:53:16.86 putting them placing them into companies in the civilian sector.
01:53:16.86 --> 01:53:21.86 Don't always hire someone based just because they have experience in a field.
01:53:21.86 --> 01:53:31.86 Actually hire them for their leadership capability because it is a lot easier to teach someone an industry than it is to teach someone leadership.
01:53:31.86 --> 01:53:35.86 So get yourself a qualified proven leader.
01:53:35.86 --> 01:53:40.86 Go to ef over watch dot com if that's what you need.
01:53:40.86 --> 01:53:43.86 And if you want to hang out with us a little bit more.

01:53:49.86 --> 01:53:52.86 Well, then we are on the interwebs.

01:54:08.86 --> 01:54:10.86 And by that, I mean,

01:54:22.86 --> 01:54:25.86 correctional officers board patrol and yes, secret service.
01:54:25.86 --> 01:54:28.86 All you first responders.

01:54:35.86 --> 01:54:43.86 To live a life of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which is what we're doing here and everyone else out there.
01:54:43.86 --> 01:54:45.86 Check yourself.
01:54:45.86 --> 01:54:48.86 You evaluate yourself honestly.
01:54:48.86 --> 01:54:54.86 Are you doing what you can do to be better?
01:54:54.86 --> 01:54:56.86 Are you working as hard as you can?
01:54:56.86 --> 01:55:01.86 And that just doesn't mean work as in your vocation or your job.
01:55:01.86 --> 01:55:06.86 Are you working to be a better father or mother or daughter or son?
01:55:06.86 --> 01:55:10.86 Are you maximizing opportunities?
01:55:10.86 --> 01:55:16.86 And again, not just professional opportunities, but opportunities to help someone.
01:55:16.86 --> 01:55:22.86 To teach someone, to coach someone, to make someone else better.
01:55:22.86 --> 01:55:30.86 Are you maximizing the opportunities to spend time with your family, to strengthen the relationships you have?
01:55:30.86 --> 01:55:38.86 Are you maximizing the opportunities to make the members of your family better?
01:55:38.86 --> 01:55:51.86 Are you every day doing everything you can to live the most emanate worthy life you can live, ask yourself those questions?
01:55:51.86 --> 01:56:07.86 And when you realize that you fall short, that we all fall short. When you realize that, then get yourself on the path to correct those shortfalls by going out there.
01:56:07.86 --> 01:56:11.86 And getting after it.
01:56:11.86 --> 01:56:21.86 And until next time, this is Echo and Jocco. Out.
