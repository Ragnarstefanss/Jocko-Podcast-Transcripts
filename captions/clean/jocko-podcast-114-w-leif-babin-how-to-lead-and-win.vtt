00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jocco podcast number 14 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, I go good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And tonight we have a guest on the podcast for the fourth time, the fourth appearance which is no surprise really

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
because this is a guy that I went to war with, started a business with, wrote a book with,

4
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I actually watched him get married and have kids and by houses and go from a, let's say a wild single man going to live a Friday night like it was his last night ever.

5
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:18.000
To a guy with a diaper in one hand and a bag of cheddar bunnies in the other hands trying to tame his son who at one year's old was like a hard-headed borderline psychotic version of himself.

6
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I also saw this guy in much harsher environments and in some of the most challenging situations.

7
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I saw him bear the incredibly heavy weight of leading men in combat and also the crushing weight of losing some of those men.

8
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I still see that weight on his shoulders.

9
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Can I see it in his eyes?

10
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I wish I could take some of it away.

11
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
But I can't.

12
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And as we learn in the seal teams, we don't complain.

13
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We shoulder our share of the weight.

14
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We shoulder our share of the burden and we drive on.

15
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We don't know if we can get a lift from the top of.

16
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Seeing him stand up when I needed him to stand up.

17
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
When what I was asking for was more than I could have asked or should have expected from anyone.

18
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And I watched him time and time and time again move out into the darkness toward the unknown,

19
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:21.000
toward the violence toward the enemy whose mission was to tame or to kill him and his men.

20
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But he went every time he went without fail.

21
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And his name is Lave Babin.

22
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And if you want a more thorough background of Lave, you can listen to the other times that he's been on this podcast.

23
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Use on number 11, number 34, number 65.

24
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You should listen to those first before you listen to this one.

25
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You can also read the book that we wrote, it's called Extreme Ownership.

26
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It's about our experiences in combat and the leadership lessons we learned there.

27
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But for now, here we are, once again, and Lave, welcome back to the show.

28
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Thanks for having me on.

29
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And we had a couple of different options on what we were going to do this time around and tweeted out,

30
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
if anybody has any questions and we got a lot of questions.

31
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I know I can answer questions, we'll just say in a really in a very in depth manner from time to time.

32
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And we got a lot of questions.

33
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So I, you know, we just took down a bunch of the questions and I'll read through some of them.

34
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We'll try and burn through a bunch of these questions that we got from everybody.

35
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Let's get some.

36
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Ready to get some.

37
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Like I said, Lave is always ready to get some.

38
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Stand by the get some.

39
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
For people that don't know what that means and we often put that on social media.

40
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I don't think people recognize what that actually means.

41
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So it's like we knew we would say this all the time in combat or in training scenarios.

42
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
When you knew that, I mean, it was about to go down bullets were going to be flying around.

43
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Exposure could be going off.

44
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And you hear someone very clearly over the radio just in a real combo is coming up and be like,

45
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Stand by the get some.

46
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Yeah.

47
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So we get a joke about that.

48
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Yeah, that's, that's a, it's a true statement.

49
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Right?

50
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
You know you get some.

51
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But when you get say to that man, you know, when you should be like, you know,

52
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Stand by the get some.

53
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And people are like, he's stand by to get some.

54
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yeah.

55
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It's pretty awesome.

56
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I was on my first deployment and we were driving.

57
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Driving south from Baghdad and we got ambushed.

58
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And we were like a five or six vehicle convoy.

59
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And the ambush hit the tail and I was in, I was in number two vehicle as normal for, you know,

60
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
for, for, tune commander at the time.

61
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'm in the number two vehicle, the tail end of the ambush gets ambushed or tail end the

62
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
convoy gets camp ambushed.

63
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And when I mean, it's very clear it's RPGs are going over the convoy and

64
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
explosions and machine gun fire and it's really obvious we're getting.

65
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Um, ambushed.

66
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And what we're on a highway and we're moving fast so we, you know, it's, you know,

67
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I was like push through.

68
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You know what I mean?

69
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Like we didn't stop at all.

70
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Didn't even hesitate.

71
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And then we continued on the road and, and it, I asked for the, you know, like,

72
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
upcount from the ramps like upcount.

73
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And so, you know, I hear like vehicle six is up.

74
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And vehicle five is up and vehicle four is up and it gets the front and I'm like,

75
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Roger, we're up.

76
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Keep rolling.

77
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And then another, maybe another minute goes by.

78
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And my, but tune chief, great guy is in the back vehicle rear,

79
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you know, in the rear vehicle.

80
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So that's how you break, you know, break it up.

81
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So if something happens, he's in control there.

82
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And, and he comes up in the radio and he's like, he's like,

83
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
hey, sir, just, just one less no.

84
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I mean, we got ambushed.

85
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You're back here.

86
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Did you know that?

87
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And I go like this Roger.

88
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We got back.

89
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We had to get laugh about that one.

90
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But it was pretty good times.

91
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So awesome.

92
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yeah.

93
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
All right.

94
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Getting to some questions.

95
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This is a question that actually came very similar question.

96
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I went in when I had Tony on.

97
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And most of these questions, because I said these questions are for

98
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the life coming on the podcast.

99
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And most of them are directed at you.

100
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And I'll chime in or whatever if I feel the need.

101
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But you like that.

102
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So here we go.

103
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
First one, life.

104
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
How often did you disagree with Jocco's commands?

105
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And how many times did you actually let him know?

106
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Also, how did you handle either situation?

107
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So there you go.

108
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I disagree with Jocco every minute every day.

109
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Listen, we actually, we had a, it's a great question.

110
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And look, Jocco and our different people, we have different views of the world.

111
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We have, there were, there were times when, you know,

112
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
his job was, your job was strategic.

113
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And you're looking at the bigger strategic picture.

114
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
My job was tactical.

115
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I'm looking at the tactical picture.

116
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Sometimes you can make the tactical decision that could impact the strategic mission.

117
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And ever, it was very rare though that we ever had any kind of disagreement on those things.

118
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I think, you know, there were, there were a number of times that when,

119
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
what I always liked about Jocco and I think people look at you and think,

120
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
oh, he's just big and timidating guy.

121
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And our member, our commanding officer, actually.

122
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We were talking to him.

123
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And of course he loved our task in it.

124
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And he was like, yeah, you guys and bruises.

125
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
He was talking to me and the Delta Potun commander.

126
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And said it.

127
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You guys, you got to do a Jocco says, you know, he'll choke you out.

128
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And we were kind of laughing about that because we were trying to get to every morning

129
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
like, not having choked out by Jocco hundreds of times.

130
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
It's not even a threat anymore.

131
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But it was, it was never, we never did what you said because it was fear and timidation.

132
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Or like, we have to do what he says because he's in charge.

133
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
What I always loved about you and your leadership was that I knew that I could push back on

134
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
myself and you were going to listen to me.

135
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And it was, it was interesting for me to see that as, you know, we built a relationship

136
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
about, I could, I could come in and be like, hey, I think we ought to do this.

137
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And very rarely would you, you would never say like, no do it this way because it's my way.

138
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
But even very rarely would you say, sometimes you might be like, well, we want to go in this direction.

139
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Here's why I want to do this.

140
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
But most of the time you would actually just say, hey, we'll talk me through that.

141
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Okay, what, how's that going to work?

142
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And you would give me the opportunity and others in the opportunity to come up with a plan and kind of analyze it and look at it and and give it a shot.

143
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And so that's, that's where I love, always loved about about that.

144
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I mean, a couple of disagreements that came up, you know, for me, something that we taught at all the time,

145
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
you know, with our business as long front, when we were talking to companies and leadership teams,

146
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
going to the work of cycle, you know, we always talk about people want to hire folks and just kind of let them run and, you know,

147
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
people want to say, hey, give them, give them the opportunity to go out and succeed.

148
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And a lot of bosses want to kind of, you know, what just, hey, I'm really busy hire someone to experience put them in position.

149
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
You kept really, really tight reigns on us.

150
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And initially that was super frustrating to me.

151
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I mean, I, I remember being in our, our Mount Training, military operations, urban training,

152
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
training for folks that don't know what that means where we're, we're in the mock,

153
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:23.000
cinder block city and we talked about that on the podcast and talked about that often here for, for other folks at other podcasts, but that was,

154
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I wanted to plan these things. I'm the Patoon Command or I want to be in charge.

155
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I remember you, you've seen, hey, we should do this or let's plan it this way, and I remember wanting to kind of push back against that.

156
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And, and oftentimes, but I recognize like as we're going on, you're actually training me and, and given me the,

157
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
you've done a whole bunch of these operations that I hadn't done any of those operations previously.

158
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So you were teaching me and mentoring me and, and once we got to the battlefield, you just unleashed us to get after it.

159
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And a couple of times I do remember some push back where you came up and gave me some direction and, you know,

160
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
where you said, hey, why don't you try this or do that? And one of those times in particular was when I was, you know,

161
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
when I was trying to get, get, I remember a number of times, I want to amount out at, and our, our desert training facility,

162
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:22.000
out at what we call land warfare, and I'm trying to get the Patoon, to pull back to position and we're trying to,

163
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
trying to patrol out and you gave me, you told me to actually, you know, stop trying to put, put a bunch of detail information out of the radio,

164
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
like use verbal commands, do it this way, and I, you know, immediately, my ego getting the way I was in,

165
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
it was frustrating because the team wasn't doing what I wanted to do.

166
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And that's like step number one of the frustration. So my team isn't doing what I wanted to do.

167
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So automatically my media is kind of starting to get paged and like, you know, the, no one's listening to me.

168
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So when Jocco comes up to give me some direction of like, hey, you ought to do this.

169
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
My immediate push back is like, no, I'm not going to do that, you know, and I didn't say that, but I, I just, I was like, I kind of bristled a little bit.

170
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I remember kind of bristling that, and I was like, okay, let me think about it.

171
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
What do we, you know, he hasn't told me wrong before, and I was like, let me give that a shot.

172
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I was like, okay, I'll do that. Use verbal commands, get everybody moving.

173
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And you do that over and over and over again throughout multiple training scenarios.

174
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And then on the battlefield as well, where that's what built up trust.

175
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So when when you did tell me to do something, I'm going to give it a shot and, and it worked.

176
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Yeah, it worked.

177
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It worked.

178
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You just expand on that a little bit. The verbal command thing is so you get guys that, there's a bunch of people, you know,

179
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you got, you got a person, we'll just take this case. You got a tune of 16 guys.

180
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
They're in various terrain features. One guy's in a little, in a little, a ravine.

181
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
One guy's up on a little, another guy's behind a shrub. So there's a little bit of dispersion with your troops.

182
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And you want to get them to do something. You want to get them to fall back or you want to get them to master where you are.

183
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And maybe the shooting stop or whatever, but you, you want to control all these people at the same time.

184
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And so what you think is, hey, I'll just get on the radio and I'll tell everyone, hey, everyone.

185
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I'm back about a hundred meters back. There's a, a little piece of terrain sticking out.

186
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:09.000
There's a rock by it. I'm behind that rock. And if you guys start peeling back here to the northwest at about 090 degrees, that's where you're flying me.

187
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Okay, so now what does that come across like on a transmission for a guy that's shooting a machine gun?

188
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
He, he hears like, got, got, got, got. Come back, got.

189
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
That's what he hears. You know, he anything.

190
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And, and so, and you've given this long complex direction. And what you really need is, have everyone fall back here.

191
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Now that's what that's what they need to hear. And so then you do it and you realize that now we have a thing in this hill,

192
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
teams where you pass the command. And so when you hear a loud verbal command, everyone passes it. Now everyone heard it.

193
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And now everyone comes back to your position.

194
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But this is the essence of in the book of tree ownership. This is really the essence of simple like it's simple clear communications.

195
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And that's one of those things that we want you learn it. You know, like, yeah, if I, if I, if I people with my team isn't doing what I wanted to do, not that they don't want to.

196
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They don't even know what you want to do because you're giving it in such a complex way.

197
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I, I, I gave that council hundreds of times once I was running the training on the west coast. I gave that council hundreds of times. Like, hey, man, just tell everyone a simple command right now to get him to do something. So that holds true.

198
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And I'll tell you another situation where you, you kind of disagreed with me. And we, we were working with the company. I'm not going to mention the company's name.

199
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We were working with the company and there was a scene, like a mid level, but somewhat senior leader.

200
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And you didn't like him. And there isn't you didn't like him because he wasn't really that confident. He had mess some things up.

201
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And his whole, his division was suffering a little bit. And you were, you were kind of like, hey, Jocca, we should talk about getting this guy fired.

202
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Well, it wasn't that he was, it just wasn't that he was competent. His division was suffering. Like they were like, hey, what's the, this guy is dragging us down. This is a major issue.

203
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And, and I was, we were getting massive negative feedback that was impacting the team.

204
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So I think you can all demonstrate what you, and even that I discovered. And then probably the leaders like me.

205
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And this union that only kinda had received confidence.

206
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
That's what was quite panicked.

207
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
But when I go to adversity it becomes a start of getting good expectations.

208
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So, you know, talking about…

209
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And I just wanted to take it from my guy who was supposed to be the knowledgeable guy, that was able to grill him into the jurors.

210
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.64
You know, maybe question what was going on there if you were moved to the key leader from so strategically at that point in the company that individual

211
00:15:36.32 --> 00:15:38.48
Who was you know again?

212
00:15:38.48 --> 00:15:44.84
We'll just say incompetent and also unlike he had really really good political and

213
00:15:45.40 --> 00:15:47.40
relationship connections with

214
00:15:48.84 --> 00:15:55.88
The we'll say a parent company, but the people that controlled the funding and so we could get rid of this guy

215
00:15:55.88 --> 00:16:00.64
But all of a sudden all these people that were funding this company there was gonna be problems and

216
00:16:01.76 --> 00:16:05.68
I was like hey if we get rid of that guy we're gonna cut a lot of relationship chords

217
00:16:05.96 --> 00:16:12.36
So we let's try and find a way to mitigate as much we can and we we disagreed upon it but

218
00:16:13.52 --> 00:16:19.12
Basically, you know you fundamentally got the other leader in that division

219
00:16:19.64 --> 00:16:24.76
To figure out how to work with the guy and got him trained up and then that guy took enough control

220
00:16:24.76 --> 00:16:31.04
That they mitigated the non-performer kind of out of the picture and it worked out well

221
00:16:31.72 --> 00:16:33.72
And I think the lesson there is that you know

222
00:16:33.92 --> 00:16:38.16
Like I mentioned earlier you can win the tactical battle and lose this this strategic

223
00:16:38.56 --> 00:16:44.32
War and you certainly don't want to do that. I think you got to recognize it when you're whether it's trying to terminating someone or making decisions

224
00:16:44.32 --> 00:16:47.02
I think that's where we had you know

225
00:16:47.02 --> 00:16:50.84
You had that strategic picture in mind and I was focused a little more on the on the tactical side

226
00:16:50.84 --> 00:16:56.78
So you got to you got to keep you can make the right tactical call and can have some real strategic consequences

227
00:16:56.78 --> 00:17:00.72
You know the cascade and cause you a lot more problems. I think though that the

228
00:17:01.16 --> 00:17:07.04
My true answer this question on our most fundamental disagreement came on patches and

229
00:17:08.40 --> 00:17:09.52
That was

230
00:17:09.52 --> 00:17:14.28
Jaco was understood as seals that we needed to be squirt away

231
00:17:14.36 --> 00:17:18.54
We wanted to be stormtroopers and tea bruiser. That's what we wanted to we wanted to all look the same

232
00:17:18.54 --> 00:17:23.50
We wanted to have you know squirt away here cut squirt or a uniforms everybody in the same same year

233
00:17:23.50 --> 00:17:29.14
And that's hard for seals because seals often one of just kind of where a you know mix and match of uniforms and and

234
00:17:29.38 --> 00:17:33.92
Kind of whatever gear that you want to look cool straight up long hair appear to all those things

235
00:17:33.92 --> 00:17:37.48
You recognize we needed to win you do that and and guys can get out of control

236
00:17:37.48 --> 00:17:44.62
We have all these patches made that are you know that are like look at these cool guy. I got patches all over me and and and that's

237
00:17:44.62 --> 00:17:49.000
Seals are some of the best you know the biggest offenders that so Jaco was like no patch

238
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.22
Yeah, and just to expand on this a little bit more but the strategically from the army from the Marine Corps

239
00:17:53.22 --> 00:17:56.98
The army the Marine Corps when they look at someone that's not in the square to you to square to a uniform

240
00:17:56.98 --> 00:18:01.42
They think to they think to themselves. Hey, if this guy can't even wear a square to a uniform

241
00:18:01.42 --> 00:18:06.42
How can he operate out in the battlefield and that's what what they think and good for them because it's a true statement

242
00:18:06.42 --> 00:18:13.50
If you've got someone that can't mind some some details and looks square to weigh then how can I expect them to do their job well now

243
00:18:13.50 --> 00:18:18.54
In this in the sealed teams and really in all soft communities. There's some absolute

244
00:18:18.86 --> 00:18:23.86
Lack City when it comes to uniform requirements. That's why you see pictures of guys doing this

245
00:18:24.14 --> 00:18:29.58
You know dressing out of uniform and mixing imagine uniforms. It's the way it is and you know what my in my

246
00:18:30.38 --> 00:18:36.70
In my deepest knowledge. I know that you can have it and this is a classic military quote is you know

247
00:18:36.70 --> 00:18:44.46
An inspection ready platoon has never passed combat and a combat ready platoon has never passed inspection

248
00:18:44.46 --> 00:18:47.90
It's it's a commonly known thing that I understand and I get and

249
00:18:49.42 --> 00:18:55.02
But especially we're new in the battle space. We're just showing up here. We got you know Marines and and

250
00:18:56.14 --> 00:18:59.02
Army soldiers and senior leadership that we're gonna be working for and I say okay

251
00:18:59.02 --> 00:19:02.000
We're gonna make a good this is the bait the fundamentally we're gonna make a good first impression

252
00:19:02.16 --> 00:19:04.62
We're gonna look square to weigh which means we're gonna

253
00:19:04.62 --> 00:19:08.96
You know have square to weigh here cuts we're gonna blouse our boots and we're gonna wear a

254
00:19:09.34 --> 00:19:14.82
Normal looking uniform which means we don't have crazy looking patches that that

255
00:19:15.14 --> 00:19:19.98
Make us look different right cuz that's the thing that you're saying the thing you're saying is look at me. That's what you're saying

256
00:19:19.98 --> 00:19:23.18
Look at me. I'm cool that's what a patch is it's hey look at me

257
00:19:24.34 --> 00:19:30.34
I'm special and and and obviously I don't like that attitude and so here we go back to the patches

258
00:19:30.34 --> 00:19:36.52
So we I mean when you told me we were on board with everything on the same page and we saw out

259
00:19:36.52 --> 00:19:41.54
I have so many things that certainly me and the Delta Potent Commander with you absolutely and

260
00:19:41.86 --> 00:19:44.18
But that was I don't know why but for one reason

261
00:19:44.98 --> 00:19:51.86
We got together. I was like we designed our own patches were like where do you say we patch me and the Delta Potent Commander

262
00:19:52.06 --> 00:19:59.22
We me and the Delta Potent Commander said we're gonna design some batches for testing in a bruiser and I don't know

263
00:19:59.22 --> 00:20:03.22
I don't know why if we just had an idea that this was gonna be a historic unit

264
00:20:03.22 --> 00:20:06.26
This was gonna be something we wanted to be a part of but we felt like we needed

265
00:20:06.90 --> 00:20:11.70
Tasking the patch and I felt like you secretly wanted us to have them even though you told us not to do it

266
00:20:12.22 --> 00:20:15.54
So so I was like we designed these patches one of them

267
00:20:15.54 --> 00:20:18.66
I use the Lordy humongous from the roadbore your

268
00:20:19.18 --> 00:20:24.22
For one and the other one we had a we had a big calcule and and it was

269
00:20:24.22 --> 00:20:30.54
So we had these two patches went out we had a maid so we I secretly had them shift. I secretly had them distributed to

270
00:20:30.82 --> 00:20:34.90
To both Latins and we keep them in our shoulder patch pocket and we be

271
00:20:35.42 --> 00:20:39.78
So we'd be in a convoy ready to roll out. Jock will come out see everybody off shake hands to everybody

272
00:20:40.50 --> 00:20:43.02
And we'd be launched on the operation and

273
00:20:43.58 --> 00:20:47.38
We'd come up over the radio my leading pan out to come up with a random like patches on

274
00:20:47.82 --> 00:20:50.56
Everyone pull the badges out slap the badges on and then we all

275
00:20:50.56 --> 00:20:56.04
Though we got busted when there was an embedded reporter with there was an embedded reporter

276
00:20:56.88 --> 00:21:01.72
With one of the units we were working with and there was some photos of patches so we got busted

277
00:21:01.72 --> 00:21:08.96
Although you didn't you didn't come down on me hard like that. You just because you mentioned that we had this conversation on text the other day

278
00:21:08.96 --> 00:21:13.80
I'm I'm actually I just pulled up my phone to read this text to back and forth. We were just talking about

279
00:21:15.24 --> 00:21:17.04
You were basically saying hey, you know

280
00:21:17.04 --> 00:21:23.86
You does not forget you didn't want us to wear patches and and then and then I wrote back to you. Hey, don't forget that while I was out

281
00:21:23.86 --> 00:21:25.86
I would lead disapproving

282
00:21:25.86 --> 00:21:32.40
Inside I was smiling knowing that a little rebelliousness is an important is important for leaders to possess and

283
00:21:32.64 --> 00:21:37.04
That a spree decor trumps compliance and uniformity. Oh

284
00:21:37.20 --> 00:21:41.36
That's an actual text conversation we were having that's kind of jacked up isn't it

285
00:21:41.36 --> 00:21:47.12
But my point is like you you know obviously it meant something to you and it was bringing the team together

286
00:21:47.12 --> 00:21:51.72
It's like when you go through boot camp and the drone structures will let you get away with something because they know

287
00:21:51.72 --> 00:21:53.72
It's reunifying the team and that's what it was for me

288
00:21:53.72 --> 00:21:59.72
It's like okay and also how much the leadership capital might gonna expand because even though I just made it sound like it was a big deal

289
00:21:59.72 --> 00:22:03.04
It that and and also we had earned a good reputation

290
00:22:03.04 --> 00:22:04.60
We it wasn't the first impression anymore

291
00:22:04.60 --> 00:22:09.08
It was like the impression had been made and the impression was solid and so now it's like oh, yeah

292
00:22:09.08 --> 00:22:12.56
These guys are these guys. Oh, yeah, they're actually a unit identifying patch

293
00:22:13.08 --> 00:22:19.08
So we actually and we gave that patch to the brigade commander. Yeah, we departed which was awesome and and I'm very proud to say that

294
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.08
There's not a whole lot up on the wall in the jocco gym

295
00:22:23.72 --> 00:22:27.56
But in the garage there, but there is a

296
00:22:27.56 --> 00:22:28.92
TU bruiser patch

297
00:22:28.92 --> 00:22:34.24
It's in the Lord you must represent there's a seven echo from my from my echo platoon at team seven

298
00:22:34.24 --> 00:22:36.84
And there's a sealed team one patch. I mean a sticker

299
00:22:36.84 --> 00:22:39.24
That's my that's my wall of glory

300
00:22:41.40 --> 00:22:48.000
Stapled to the wall awesome all right next question. So that's the one question we're 20 minutes deep. You got to like that

301
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
All right next question

302
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.04
Can you discuss the evolution of echelon front was the company ready for the explosive popularity of extreme ownership?

303
00:22:58.04 --> 00:23:00.04
What kinds of challenges have you faced?

304
00:23:00.44 --> 00:23:04.64
We faced all kinds of challenges and the same challenges that that any business faces

305
00:23:04.64 --> 00:23:09.04
Certainly and you know for for us it's been learned to the fire hose

306
00:23:09.04 --> 00:23:11.80
It's been it's been an awesome experience. I mean, I think

307
00:23:12.40 --> 00:23:16.24
Just like any just like our combat experience we would adapt to the battlefield

308
00:23:16.24 --> 00:23:20.96
We learned we educated ourselves about things that we didn't know about and and and we've grown

309
00:23:20.96 --> 00:23:27.60
I mean, I don't think anyone could I don't know if we could have predicted just how you know widely disseminated the book would be or

310
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:30.24
Or you know the popular things that we're talking about

311
00:23:30.24 --> 00:23:34.96
We knew they were powerful it's a whole reason we wrote the book. There's a massive demand signal for it and

312
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:41.44
And I think you know as we work with companies now through through our company echelon front them and there's just we're able to go and

313
00:23:42.36 --> 00:23:43.72
deliver

314
00:23:43.72 --> 00:23:51.96
Some impact to these teams in a way that other people aren't able to do it because most of the folks in that space are it's a feel good thing

315
00:23:51.96 --> 00:23:53.96
You're out there to talk about a

316
00:23:53.96 --> 00:23:59.68
You guys you're great and let's harness your inner potential and you know, this kind of stuff and and I laugh when people call us

317
00:23:59.68 --> 00:24:05.000
motivational speakers because I say look motivational speakers tell you how good good you are and

318
00:24:05.28 --> 00:24:09.40
We're here to tell you how much you saw better you got to get better if you want to win

319
00:24:09.40 --> 00:24:14.68
So that's what we do and I think it's the same same way that that that brutally honest assessment of yourself your team

320
00:24:14.68 --> 00:24:21.16
The same thing that makes you know seal unit successful in the battlefield and other military units is the same thing that we're doing now with our company

321
00:24:21.28 --> 00:24:25.72
Certainly you know all the challenges of of bookkeeping and and and you know

322
00:24:25.72 --> 00:24:30.64
The building processes and and pay and taxes and I mean just to you know

323
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:33.72
Regulatory environment those things that make it hard for any business launching

324
00:24:34.20 --> 00:24:40.04
But just like on the battlefield where we can either bitch about the paperwork or we can figure out a way to most

325
00:24:40.04 --> 00:24:43.12
Of efficiently get it done so that we could actually go accomplish the mission

326
00:24:43.84 --> 00:24:47.30
Which you instilled in us like hey I can complain about it all day

327
00:24:47.30 --> 00:24:52.30
I can figure out a way to get this done to make it happen because that's what it requires to do and that's what we've done with our business

328
00:24:52.30 --> 00:24:57.16
And it's it's been awesome and frankly what I love is working with

329
00:24:57.90 --> 00:25:00.86
Leaders and so many of the folks that contact us that want to work with us

330
00:25:00.86 --> 00:25:06.62
They they're already doing well and they want to do even better and it's just so much fun to work with folks who

331
00:25:07.34 --> 00:25:13.50
Want to just constantly grow and learn and we grow and learn all the time from them. Yeah. Yeah

332
00:25:14.74 --> 00:25:16.74
I think you hit it all

333
00:25:17.22 --> 00:25:19.22
Next question

334
00:25:19.22 --> 00:25:28.36
In battle having the high ground is crucial how do you see this principle apply to the business world and and we have I've answered this question before with the statement

335
00:25:29.26 --> 00:25:31.94
Take the high ground to the high ground. I'll take you so

336
00:25:33.02 --> 00:25:35.02
Business world okay. Well tactically

337
00:25:35.78 --> 00:25:37.78
What do you think why do you the high ground?

338
00:25:38.42 --> 00:25:40.86
Well, I think that's that's the real question right?

339
00:25:40.86 --> 00:25:43.86
The why is the high ground important and

340
00:25:44.58 --> 00:25:47.42
Obviously you know out of thousands of years of military history

341
00:25:47.42 --> 00:25:51.34
The high ground is always important by the way

342
00:25:51.34 --> 00:25:57.94
I did have I did have a training instructor a few years ago my my seal team days who we had he said look at your high speed

343
00:25:57.94 --> 00:25:59.94
Elton and watch and

344
00:25:59.94 --> 00:26:02.26
And you get get down behind something

345
00:26:02.50 --> 00:26:06.58
So he was basically telling us like if that thing's going up you're wrong. That's your thing should be going down

346
00:26:06.58 --> 00:26:10.62
He was he was telling us to take the low ground which was which was kind of laughable

347
00:26:10.62 --> 00:26:15.70
So out doing thousands of years of military history always take the low ground

348
00:26:15.70 --> 00:26:20.38
No, don't do that you want to take the high ground the reason is because tactically if you're on the high ground

349
00:26:20.50 --> 00:26:24.90
You you have got a better shooting position you can shoot down on people who can't hide very well

350
00:26:25.06 --> 00:26:29.58
Because you you you're above them which is why it was awesome for us to be in and buildings

351
00:26:29.58 --> 00:26:33.82
And if we could get a three or four story building in this you know in the city of Ramada the urban environment

352
00:26:33.82 --> 00:26:34.66
It was awesome

353
00:26:34.66 --> 00:26:39.06
It's no different in the business environment and and what you have to do is just identify the key terrain

354
00:26:39.18 --> 00:26:41.54
What is the key to right the high ground is key terrain?

355
00:26:42.26 --> 00:26:45.02
So that that doesn't it doesn't necessarily mean that you know

356
00:26:45.02 --> 00:26:48.30
You're gonna go climb to the mountain top because that's where you want to be

357
00:26:49.14 --> 00:26:53.30
But if that ridge line that's on the high ground gives you you know a tackle vanishing on the battlefield

358
00:26:53.30 --> 00:26:56.50
That's it's the same thing in business world if you're if you're a retailer

359
00:26:56.70 --> 00:26:58.34
You know, where's that key terrain?

360
00:26:58.34 --> 00:27:02.22
Where's the intersection that that's that you want to be that's gonna give your business the the best

361
00:27:02.78 --> 00:27:05.18
You know the best chance to succeed if you're

362
00:27:05.74 --> 00:27:12.38
You know any space I mean there's there's key terrain that you can identify where you want to be a part of if it's if you're a private equity company

363
00:27:12.38 --> 00:27:15.78
You're trying to get breaking to some new you know some some new technology or new

364
00:27:16.42 --> 00:27:19.34
New particular industry that that's that's key terrain

365
00:27:19.34 --> 00:27:22.94
You need to be focused on that and identify that is critical a wide-sum important and

366
00:27:23.90 --> 00:27:28.06
And everyone's gonna be gonna be gonna be fine for that and you want to be aggressive you want to maneuver

367
00:27:28.70 --> 00:27:30.70
Because if you get their first

368
00:27:31.26 --> 00:27:35.18
You're gonna be a lot better position. It's it's flank or be flanked. We always say you know

369
00:27:35.18 --> 00:27:36.94
You're maneuvering the enemy other gonna maneuver on you

370
00:27:37.58 --> 00:27:41.94
So what you don't want to do is wait for somebody else to get in a better position

371
00:27:41.94 --> 00:27:46.14
And then you actually have to fight your way out of that. It's not good like in jujitsu

372
00:27:46.14 --> 00:27:49.86
You don't want to wait to someone's gonna mount you that's not a good place to be or take your back

373
00:27:49.86 --> 00:27:52.10
Right, I want to try to prevent that before you can get there

374
00:27:52.82 --> 00:27:55.94
And and if you can do that to them first and you're in a much better position

375
00:27:55.94 --> 00:28:00.50
I think it's no different in the business world. I had it was working with a company the other day and

376
00:28:01.66 --> 00:28:03.70
Basically what they were saying was that their competitor

377
00:28:04.26 --> 00:28:07.70
Was lying about them to to as they're trying to close accounts

378
00:28:07.70 --> 00:28:13.82
They're they're competitive would go in the field and say oh yeah this this the company are this this company

379
00:28:13.82 --> 00:28:18.02
They don't do it right and they don't have these accounts and they're they're going out of business and everything's bad

380
00:28:18.02 --> 00:28:20.98
So there's there's their competitors were out there lying about them and

381
00:28:21.98 --> 00:28:23.62
You know the sales leaders said you know

382
00:28:23.62 --> 00:28:26.02
I don't I don't want to stoop to their level

383
00:28:26.58 --> 00:28:30.50
You know and and start throwing lies out there about them or making accusations

384
00:28:30.50 --> 00:28:31.86
I think that's you know

385
00:28:31.86 --> 00:28:35.70
I said well no you don't want to take the logo you want to take the high ground and he said well

386
00:28:35.70 --> 00:28:38.34
Yeah, but at the same time what what are we supposed to do and I said well

387
00:28:39.38 --> 00:28:44.34
You actually have the most powerful weapon in this fight the weapon that you have is the truth

388
00:28:44.58 --> 00:28:47.42
You have the you have the truth but you're not getting the truth out there

389
00:28:47.42 --> 00:28:51.38
I said what do you do when you do close the count? What do you do how do you publicize it? He's the cool we really don't

390
00:28:52.50 --> 00:28:57.38
And I said well do you do you do a press release when you close a big count? No, we don't do that

391
00:28:57.38 --> 00:29:02.98
Do you advertise anyway? No, we don't do that. I said so the most powerful weapon you have is the truth and you're not utilizing that weapon

392
00:29:02.98 --> 00:29:08.74
You need to have a propaganda arm at this company that's gonna go out there and explain

393
00:29:09.22 --> 00:29:15.06
That the all the wins and what the truth really is and that will be more powerful and then you can maintain the high ground and by the way

394
00:29:15.46 --> 00:29:19.86
When those other companies are out there line about you and then people find out

395
00:29:20.26 --> 00:29:22.26
It makes them look even worse

396
00:29:22.74 --> 00:29:26.62
So they they've broken their trust with with the potential client

397
00:29:26.62 --> 00:29:29.22
So yeah, always take the high ground always take that ground

398
00:29:29.22 --> 00:29:32.98
It might not win you the short-term battle in business, right?

399
00:29:34.42 --> 00:29:39.14
You know you see you see companies you know like a I can sell you this thing right now

400
00:29:39.14 --> 00:29:43.86
I can I can paint repaint this thing put a fresh cap coat of paint on it and sell it to you

401
00:29:44.10 --> 00:29:48.86
That's not the high ground, right? That's the low ground because it's gonna it's gonna fail you because it's on what's underneath the hood is crap

402
00:29:49.42 --> 00:29:52.02
So that might win me you know that one sale

403
00:29:52.02 --> 00:29:55.22
But what's gonna happen in the long road taking the low ground?

404
00:29:55.22 --> 00:29:59.60
You're gonna you're gonna put on yelp that you've got a crappy deal and I did you know

405
00:29:59.60 --> 00:30:03.18
I repaint it something sold it to you and it wasn't worth it and now that

406
00:30:03.74 --> 00:30:09.58
Repetace is gonna spread and it's not gonna help you if you take the high ground. Hey here's what's going on with this vehicle or whatever your selling

407
00:30:10.70 --> 00:30:16.46
Take the high ground. It's all the thing about that is is we see so many leaders and some of the most successful people

408
00:30:16.46 --> 00:30:22.82
We do that recognize how important that is to build relationships and they're they're willing to to lose a sale or we are lose a

409
00:30:22.82 --> 00:30:29.68
You know to to send someone to a competitor just to just to make sure that person gets exactly what they need and their

410
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:34.54
Build-in relationship so that means more business gets sent to them as it was what you started on the time

411
00:30:34.54 --> 00:30:40.22
It's a strategic win as opposed to a tactical win and that and that's what you've got to be focused on and that's really as a leader

412
00:30:40.22 --> 00:30:45.46
That's what you got to be looking at you got to be looking at your front line people and making sure that they they're not just out there

413
00:30:45.46 --> 00:30:48.34
Trying to win every little tactical battle, but they're going backwards strategically

414
00:30:48.34 --> 00:30:53.38
So keep that in mind. That's why you have to detach that's why you have to stay out of the weeds and when you get in the weeds

415
00:30:53.38 --> 00:30:59.50
You got to step back out of them because otherwise you lose track of that and you're gonna end up in the low ground before you even recognize it

416
00:31:00.34 --> 00:31:02.34
All right next question

417
00:31:03.26 --> 00:31:06.66
How do you control rumors and gossip within an organization?

418
00:31:08.06 --> 00:31:13.16
That's pretty easy. You just you just talked about being you know getting out there with the truth and you're propagating

419
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:17.84
Armed outside your company. It's no different inside your company. You've got to make sure that people

420
00:31:19.12 --> 00:31:24.96
It's an interesting when you work we work with leaders sometimes not you see people like I don't want to share this with my people

421
00:31:24.96 --> 00:31:28.12
You know because I don't know what they might think like they're they're thinking yeah

422
00:31:28.12 --> 00:31:33.20
Something that maybe totally not true they're they're not just sitting there not thinking anything because you're not sharing it with them

423
00:31:33.20 --> 00:31:36.80
They're coming up to their own conclusions which may be completely false or opposite

424
00:31:36.92 --> 00:31:39.30
But like we say in the in the in the Navy all the time

425
00:31:39.30 --> 00:31:47.30
You know perception is reality that becomes reality so you've got to you got to you can defeat the gossip and rumors by actually

426
00:31:47.30 --> 00:31:52.62
Just sharing the truth be open with people and and and and being first out there with the message

427
00:31:52.62 --> 00:31:55.38
So people get an understanding and even when horrible bad things go wrong

428
00:31:56.02 --> 00:32:03.18
Extreme ownership right if if you take ownership for that and say hey listen this happened here's what we're doing to fix it here's what we're doing in turn things around

429
00:32:04.02 --> 00:32:06.02
It's kind of

430
00:32:06.02 --> 00:32:09.54
People people people are not gonna lose respect for you in the organization

431
00:32:09.54 --> 00:32:12.66
They're actually gonna gain respect for years results. We talk about all the time

432
00:32:12.66 --> 00:32:20.26
So don't be afraid to do that again just get the message out there and and be transparent and talk to folks

433
00:32:24.02 --> 00:32:32.30
If you don't tell people what's going on they're gonna make up their own ideas of what's going on and the thing that I have to

434
00:32:32.30 --> 00:32:38.82
I have to we we have to we have to take this just a little bit further, right? Just a little bit further

435
00:32:39.10 --> 00:32:42.62
Because we talk about transparency right and that word gets thrown around all the time and

436
00:32:45.02 --> 00:32:49.58
Of the idea that you're just gonna you that the idea that you're just gonna tell everyone exactly what's going on and

437
00:32:50.66 --> 00:32:54.06
That sounds great and it's okay. I'm a fully transparent leader

438
00:32:54.06 --> 00:33:00.10
And I'm gonna tell everyone's going on but there's times where you actually don't want to do that there's times where you have to

439
00:33:00.10 --> 00:33:04.18
Manoeuvre and you have to be tactful and some of the things that you might tell someone

440
00:33:04.82 --> 00:33:10.58
Actually is not the right thing to do now. I'm I'm I I'm not saying we're we're gonna be dishonest with our people

441
00:33:10.58 --> 00:33:15.42
I'm not saying that and I'm saying that transparency is great thing, but I mean just on a personal level

442
00:33:16.06 --> 00:33:17.06
if

443
00:33:17.06 --> 00:33:20.06
Laves it works in for me and

444
00:33:20.58 --> 00:33:25.78
He's not doing he's doing something horrible is the best way to go about that

445
00:33:25.78 --> 00:33:31.44
To fully true full transparency is hey, life you're doing horrible at this is that the best way to do it in front of that

446
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:35.16
The entire in front of the right is that is that it's full transparency right? Hey, I'm fully transparent

447
00:33:35.44 --> 00:33:37.38
Okay, everyone welcome to the meeting today by the way

448
00:33:37.38 --> 00:33:40.78
I just wanted to point out that left Mrs. Numbers again and he's a loser

449
00:33:41.34 --> 00:33:46.78
That might be what I'm thinking that's fully transparent. Hey guys, just beat and I knew I've less to write just being transparent

450
00:33:47.02 --> 00:33:52.78
Laves and it left the loser. He missed his numbers again and you know what I'm actually thinking about firing him just

451
00:33:52.78 --> 00:33:58.06
He said anyone was wondering so that's what I'm trying to wait to close the business Friday did I do a good job

452
00:33:58.50 --> 00:34:05.70
Right, so so let's not get carried away right? You know what is the smart way the smart ways to maneuver the smart ways to say okay

453
00:34:05.70 --> 00:34:13.82
Laves not doing what he wants what he should be doing if I go and accuse him of failing what's his reaction going to be how is it

454
00:34:13.82 --> 00:34:15.10
so

455
00:34:15.10 --> 00:34:17.34
What I do instead instead I go I

456
00:34:17.82 --> 00:34:21.42
Want to take ownership of it and so instead I say hey, life you know

457
00:34:21.42 --> 00:34:25.18
Hey, it comes it like come to come to come on off. So I want to talk to you about a couple things

458
00:34:25.18 --> 00:34:28.62
So he comes my office or not in a public place and now it's hey, life

459
00:34:29.02 --> 00:34:33.42
Hey, man, I noticed that you you know you you missed your numbers and I'm thinking that maybe

460
00:34:33.42 --> 00:34:38.78
I'm not giving you the kind of support that you need to get where you need to be is there anything that else that you need for me

461
00:34:39.14 --> 00:34:42.94
So that you can win again inside sure

462
00:34:42.94 --> 00:34:47.50
I'm thinking life you pathetic loser you missed your numbers to get right?

463
00:34:47.50 --> 00:34:54.46
But I'm not gonna do that so the full transparency thing I get it and it makes sense

464
00:34:55.34 --> 00:34:57.34
But we do have to

465
00:34:57.90 --> 00:35:03.26
Consider the tertiary and the secondary interchier effects of the things that we say especially as a leader

466
00:35:03.26 --> 00:35:08.46
You what you say is a lot of impact as a leader and sometimes I see leaders they make a little off the cuff for mark about something

467
00:35:08.46 --> 00:35:10.94
You know, oh that won't matter. Oh

468
00:35:10.94 --> 00:35:18.38
Oh, okay, so it doesn't matter so so this little thing you know hey, hey boss we want to get this this task done by this date

469
00:35:18.94 --> 00:35:20.06
Is it still important?

470
00:35:20.06 --> 00:35:24.74
I doesn't matter. Oh, okay, so it doesn't matter. So what I was working on for last month and a half doesn't matter. Okay cool great

471
00:35:24.98 --> 00:35:26.98
I was fully transparent

472
00:35:26.98 --> 00:35:32.38
So just be careful use tat use your brain. Yeah, that's that's 100% correct

473
00:35:32.38 --> 00:35:35.90
I think you know what I was trying to explain in the in the first situation. I mean

474
00:35:35.90 --> 00:35:42.22
I was having a conversation with a leader that we work with who was you know telling me that

475
00:35:42.22 --> 00:35:45.82
There was a key leader in his team that didn't want to share with any of his key leaders that

476
00:35:46.78 --> 00:35:48.78
they you know

477
00:35:48.70 --> 00:35:50.70
They they're the

478
00:35:50.70 --> 00:35:54.62
He didn't want to share with the key leaders that they were there were haven't has haven't some issues

479
00:35:54.62 --> 00:35:58.70
Having some dire strengths wonder you know get into a point where they're wondering hey

480
00:35:58.70 --> 00:36:00.30
I don't know if we're gonna make payroll

481
00:36:00.70 --> 00:36:03.66
You know a few months from now if we don't turn these things around

482
00:36:03.66 --> 00:36:09.50
But I don't want to share that with them because I don't want them to panic and when I when I heard that I was like

483
00:36:10.70 --> 00:36:15.78
What kind of panic are they gonna have when they find out? Yeah, they can't make payroll

484
00:36:15.78 --> 00:36:20.30
But no one told them about it and they thought everything was great so the pan is gonna be a hundred times worse

485
00:36:20.30 --> 00:36:23.90
Yeah, and that's that's the kind of transfer. I'm talking about what you're like listen

486
00:36:23.90 --> 00:36:30.02
You need to go and have a direct conversation to say guys here's where we're at yeah, and that should be something to help get them in gear

487
00:36:30.02 --> 00:36:34.50
I'd be like listen we have got to we've got to hit these numbers. We've got to get things going again

488
00:36:34.50 --> 00:36:39.94
We've got to turn performance around or this is where we're gonna be next quarter if we don't do that and I think those

489
00:36:40.38 --> 00:36:46.10
That's the kind of thing I'm talking about where you're not keeping the secrets is not hurting you out because by the way

490
00:36:46.10 --> 00:36:50.82
Everyone knows the numbers right so they know they're already probably know your entire strengths and they're thinking well

491
00:36:50.82 --> 00:36:54.46
I better find a backup job and they're gonna leave and now you're an even war straight

492
00:36:54.46 --> 00:37:00.94
So yeah, absolutely you don't need to hide information from from the team all right

493
00:37:00.94 --> 00:37:06.46
You know what we actually have like a few questions on the master that people asked

494
00:37:07.02 --> 00:37:09.02
one of them was

495
00:37:09.34 --> 00:37:11.34
One of them was why should I come to the master?

496
00:37:12.22 --> 00:37:14.22
What do you think?

497
00:37:14.46 --> 00:37:17.26
Why should you come to the master?

498
00:37:18.78 --> 00:37:21.98
By the way the master in case you don't know the master's a leadership

499
00:37:21.98 --> 00:37:28.62
Event is it seminar gathering a gathering oh, okay?

500
00:37:28.62 --> 00:37:34.78
I like it get over that leaders so the masters of a leadership gathering where we get together and we

501
00:37:35.66 --> 00:37:39.98
Talk about leadership and we have them twice a well this one we're having twice a year

502
00:37:40.30 --> 00:37:41.66
But anyways

503
00:37:41.98 --> 00:37:45.42
Why should someone come to the master what do you think?

504
00:37:46.78 --> 00:37:48.78
What I love about the master is

505
00:37:48.78 --> 00:37:52.54
Well, you have to understand that we talk to

506
00:37:53.66 --> 00:37:57.10
Hundreds of we've we've actually worked with we talked a thousands of leaders over the last

507
00:37:57.66 --> 00:38:02.30
Six years that we've had this company as long front work with hundreds of companies and about every industry

508
00:38:02.30 --> 00:38:06.22
You can imagine and we speak it a lot of leadership conferences we speak at them all the time

509
00:38:07.42 --> 00:38:13.98
And there is nothing like the master there just isn't anything out there like the muster nothing even comes close

510
00:38:14.62 --> 00:38:16.22
And the reason I love it

511
00:38:16.22 --> 00:38:22.94
I'm gonna I I I just get super excited to be there and be a part of that stuff and I even use words like magical

512
00:38:23.66 --> 00:38:28.46
to describe it on previous podcasts which I took some heavys for took a lot of heavys for out there was pretty much

513
00:38:28.46 --> 00:38:31.74
There were there was a pretty good like Disney Disney memes

514
00:38:32.30 --> 00:38:36.06
Disney memes going there that was pretty good but the the reason the master is so amazing is

515
00:38:36.78 --> 00:38:41.02
It's just different from anything else that that we do and I think when I think about what really makes the master different

516
00:38:41.02 --> 00:38:47.50
It's the the people that are there it's the content that we're talking about and it's the impact that it has and you know

517
00:38:48.14 --> 00:38:54.78
So who comes on the monster the reason that's so awesome is that there are leaders from all over the place and

518
00:38:55.02 --> 00:38:56.46
These leaders are

519
00:38:56.46 --> 00:39:01.82
Hell bent on dominating their universe. I mean these are people that are there they're in the game

520
00:39:02.54 --> 00:39:05.10
And then from every type of business every type of industry

521
00:39:05.10 --> 00:39:08.94
I mean we have entrepreneurs we have senior executives from from major companies

522
00:39:08.94 --> 00:39:14.54
We have mid level managers we have frontline leaders and we have people who really aren't even in a leadership position

523
00:39:14.54 --> 00:39:18.54
Maybe with no direct reports, but are aspiring to be that way and grow and learn

524
00:39:19.18 --> 00:39:23.50
We get we get police and firefighters and other law enforcement officers

525
00:39:24.54 --> 00:39:28.78
Members of the military I mean they're serving out there on our front lines of the home front and and abroad

526
00:39:29.58 --> 00:39:33.90
And these are the most committed people I've ever met you know it's it's it's

527
00:39:33.90 --> 00:39:40.62
One way to quantify this or when when we're at the monster the like the hotel staff

528
00:39:41.50 --> 00:39:44.62
Well, we'll come up and they'll be like oh my god

529
00:39:44.86 --> 00:39:49.74
This is crazy because for instance the doors to open to actually get in the morning of the monster

530
00:39:50.14 --> 00:39:55.98
They open at eight o'clock right or it's like a 7th 750 or 745 because it starts at eight

531
00:39:56.22 --> 00:40:01.34
745 the doors open up and most I mean like you said we go to these conference all time everyone's listening

532
00:40:01.34 --> 00:40:04.30
Been to some kind of conference and it's you know people are meandering around

533
00:40:04.86 --> 00:40:11.42
They don't really care at the monster. It's like the doors open at 745 everyone's out in the hallway

534
00:40:11.42 --> 00:40:16.62
We're out in the hallway hanging out with everyone at you know seven o'clock and that's after

535
00:40:17.02 --> 00:40:23.26
We do a 445 PT in the morning we do because we do a little get some and that's another thing like the hotel people

536
00:40:23.58 --> 00:40:27.58
We're clearing it with hotel. We're just letting them know like hey, there's gonna be a large gathering of people in

537
00:40:27.58 --> 00:40:32.46
In front of the hotel in the morning and they're like well, what time? And we're like oh 445 and they're they say well

538
00:40:32.94 --> 00:40:39.10
Like how many people or like well? There's 450 people here so there's gonna be about 450 people here and sure enough

539
00:40:39.42 --> 00:40:42.54
There it is and that's what the whole monster's like oh we say

540
00:40:43.18 --> 00:40:47.58
Hey, we're gonna restart in 10 minutes and everyone goes out and they come back in in 10 minutes

541
00:40:47.58 --> 00:40:52.38
Everyone's seated ready to rock and all so that's that's the and that's it's funny to hear that from an outside perspective

542
00:40:52.38 --> 00:40:57.90
Because we're in it, but the hotel people always make comments about they say hey we've never

543
00:40:58.46 --> 00:41:02.54
You know, Kyle say hey I've been I've been running conferences here for 22 years

544
00:41:02.54 --> 00:41:08.38
I've never seen a group of people like this so that that to me shows you what kind of people show up at the

545
00:41:08.38 --> 00:41:13.18
Master when the end when the door is open it's just bum rush in there everyone wants to be in that front row

546
00:41:13.90 --> 00:41:16.30
Yeah, and gays so they can ask and not just so they can

547
00:41:16.30 --> 00:41:22.46
You know, so they can actually ask questions so they can actually engage with us and that's what I love about those folks

548
00:41:22.46 --> 00:41:25.18
I mean they just they're not there to feel good about themselves

549
00:41:25.18 --> 00:41:33.26
Right they're there to take a hard look in the mirror and and learn and grow and get better and and and so they can better and

550
00:41:33.26 --> 00:41:38.22
Be more effective leaders so they can lead and win in their teams whatever they happen to be doing now

551
00:41:38.62 --> 00:41:43.66
So you just kind of talk about the the other question was a school comes the monster and it's a really every type different type of leader

552
00:41:43.66 --> 00:41:49.58
The another question that we got about the monster is what do we talk about with the monster?

553
00:41:52.06 --> 00:41:53.58
For

554
00:41:53.58 --> 00:41:58.06
What that that's the other piece that I really like about it is is content right it's it's content that

555
00:41:59.02 --> 00:42:03.74
We talk about it and of course I love telling more stories as you all know from this in this podcast

556
00:42:04.38 --> 00:42:09.82
We like talking about worst stories we like talking about our time in the teams and even when you just you put that photo up there

557
00:42:09.82 --> 00:42:16.46
of you know of us and Ramadhi from back in the day and and I just it just brings back great memories

558
00:42:16.46 --> 00:42:18.46
I mean those will always be

559
00:42:19.10 --> 00:42:24.14
Some of the absolute best times of my life certainly some of the worst times of my life as well

560
00:42:25.34 --> 00:42:30.38
But but mostly some of the absolute best times of my life and and so we get to talk about that

561
00:42:30.38 --> 00:42:35.74
But not just in a way that's that's a cool story, but it has impact and I think taking the taking the combat leadership lessons

562
00:42:35.74 --> 00:42:44.38
We talk about from extreme ownership and applying them directly to you know to people's lives and what they do and how to overcome their challenges

563
00:42:45.10 --> 00:42:51.66
That's what it's about it's it's super engaging and for us, you know for for me and jog it this isn't a

564
00:42:52.30 --> 00:42:58.46
The standard leadership conference where there's like 40 different speakers and the the main folks kind of get up there and spend a few hours

565
00:42:58.46 --> 00:43:01.66
I'm a weird where they're the whole time and where they're to engage with leaders

566
00:43:01.66 --> 00:43:06.14
It's me it's Jaco it's Dave Burke it's JP D'Neil from our excellent front team

567
00:43:07.02 --> 00:43:12.46
We're there where the guys on stage and even during the breaks were talking to leaders that are coming up and asking questions

568
00:43:12.62 --> 00:43:16.78
We're engaging with them no green in Q and a no green there isn't a green room

569
00:43:16.78 --> 00:43:22.70
There isn't someplace where hide behind the curtain. There isn't somewhere in the back where life is getting a cucumbers put on his eyes

570
00:43:24.22 --> 00:43:26.22
Take a load off sir

571
00:43:26.22 --> 00:43:35.62
Sipping a sipping my Jaco white to you. Yeah, look and that's you know these these folks are there to get their questions answered and to ask hard questions

572
00:43:35.94 --> 00:43:43.30
The thing that you really we really get granular on a lot and that's that's what it is you're taking like you understand the principles

573
00:43:43.70 --> 00:43:45.90
It's like it's like learning a

574
00:43:46.54 --> 00:43:48.54
Jitsu move from

575
00:43:49.10 --> 00:43:54.90
One person and they teach you a fundamental basic move and you're like okay understand that and then

576
00:43:54.90 --> 00:43:59.86
Compared to okay now you're gonna get a private lesson like that's like in a class, right?

577
00:43:59.86 --> 00:44:07.10
You hey, this is the alarm lock then you get a private lesson with someone that goes in and adapts the technique to your body style

578
00:44:07.10 --> 00:44:12.98
To the opponents that you're facing the adjustments that you need to make that's the kind of granularity we get because the

579
00:44:13.82 --> 00:44:17.74
The more you see these different angles and the other great thing is because with all these different people that you got there

580
00:44:17.74 --> 00:44:19.54
And we do group exercises

581
00:44:19.54 --> 00:44:26.62
We're now you're sitting down and we purposely don't want people to sit with with industries that they already work with so in one group

582
00:44:26.62 --> 00:44:30.86
You'll get a CEO you'll get a firefighter you'll get a

583
00:44:32.38 --> 00:44:36.62
Start-up business owner you'll get a mid-level manager and you'll get it some you know

584
00:44:36.62 --> 00:44:40.14
Red regular corporate EVP and they'll all be sitting at the same table and

585
00:44:41.14 --> 00:44:47.10
We'll give them a problem we'll give them a task and they'll come up with a solution and they'll relate it to how it affects their lives

586
00:44:47.10 --> 00:44:52.70
They're business and when you see stuff from different angles like that and you're all applying

587
00:44:52.70 --> 00:44:55.02
We're all speaking the same language because everyone there's obviously read the book

588
00:44:55.02 --> 00:44:57.82
I really understand's that every understands fundamentally what the principles are

589
00:44:57.82 --> 00:45:03.06
But now we're getting to see how they impact people's businesses and lives and leadership roles

590
00:45:03.54 --> 00:45:08.82
From all these different perspectives and it just makes you that much better. That's why during these exercises

591
00:45:09.34 --> 00:45:14.10
Like I'll also go come to float around to these different tables and listen, but the first table and I'll get to I'll be like

592
00:45:14.10 --> 00:45:17.38
Oh, man, these guys are you're I'm sitting there learning because you got like I said

593
00:45:17.38 --> 00:45:23.82
You got a firefighter that's explaining to a CEO what you do in a situation where your team has

594
00:45:24.42 --> 00:45:29.54
Decided that they're not gonna fall this procedure anymore and they have good reason why they don't want to

595
00:45:30.54 --> 00:45:34.58
Like it's one thing when you're when your team doesn't fall the procedure and you say hey

596
00:45:34.58 --> 00:45:38.90
You got to fall this procedure and you and they say well why and you say you explain it to him and they go

597
00:45:38.90 --> 00:45:41.66
Okay, that makes sense, but what about when you tell them to fall the procedure and

598
00:45:41.66 --> 00:45:44.86
And they have a reason that actually makes sense then what are you gonna do?

599
00:45:45.42 --> 00:45:48.86
Well, that's what you learn at that that the monster that's where you make the progress

600
00:45:49.34 --> 00:45:57.46
So that's good one last question that we got about the the monster is what kind of impact do you see

601
00:45:58.06 --> 00:46:05.62
From people that have been to the monster the impact is is obvious in that the number of people

602
00:46:06.50 --> 00:46:10.78
Who are there that are talking about how they just got promoted?

603
00:46:10.78 --> 00:46:17.10
You know, are they they just got put in this in this position of greater responsibility and and authority

604
00:46:17.50 --> 00:46:21.98
On their teams are they've been recognized for their exceptional performance or the folks who've come

605
00:46:21.98 --> 00:46:26.86
Come back from that and we hear about on a social media or reach out to us via email or come back to a monster

606
00:46:26.86 --> 00:46:31.02
Talk about that from what they you know what would it happen to them previously the number of leaders who

607
00:46:31.42 --> 00:46:35.66
Come and and see what we're doing and bring their teams, you know, that's what's pretty awesome

608
00:46:35.66 --> 00:46:38.30
I mean that to me when a when a CEO

609
00:46:38.30 --> 00:46:44.62
From a company comes checks out what we're doing and brings 25 of his team members back

610
00:46:44.94 --> 00:46:47.74
To be a part of that because he recognizes the impact that can have

611
00:46:48.06 --> 00:46:52.62
To his team and we'll have and it's it's just it's awesome to see that I mean these are the most

612
00:46:53.18 --> 00:46:58.54
Again the most committed people you could ever be around and they just they leave there with the knowledge to directly apply

613
00:46:58.54 --> 00:47:03.02
Things to solve problems and they learn from us they learn from each other just as you said

614
00:47:03.02 --> 00:47:07.98
And part of that too. I think is a recognition that these kinds of problems that I'm having

615
00:47:09.10 --> 00:47:13.50
Are not unique to me they're not unique to the market that I'm in they're not unique to my industry

616
00:47:13.82 --> 00:47:17.10
But their leadership problems and they and they apply everywhere

617
00:47:17.90 --> 00:47:23.74
And I'm trying to get a diverse group of people to focus their efforts to and mutually support one another

618
00:47:23.74 --> 00:47:30.14
A accomplish a mission just like everybody else in every other industry in in the in the business world as a first responder

619
00:47:30.14 --> 00:47:35.98
The military doesn't matter. It's the same thing and these same techniques apply everywhere and it just

620
00:47:36.62 --> 00:47:41.90
That's why it's awesome. I love the monster and and I I can't wait. I can't wait to meet those folks

621
00:47:42.46 --> 00:47:48.70
And and that's why so many people come back again and again and it's just it's just an awesome event

622
00:47:48.70 --> 00:47:53.66
It's the best thing that they were a part of and frankly if you don't want to have that good look in the mirror

623
00:47:53.66 --> 00:47:57.42
It's hard looking to merit yourself and have answers some tough questions about where you can do better

624
00:47:57.42 --> 00:48:02.86
You probably shouldn't come because it's not for you. It's it's for people who are our eager to

625
00:48:03.66 --> 00:48:10.38
Destroy their competition and dominate the universe and that starts with looking at themselves and taking ownership and solving problems

626
00:48:10.78 --> 00:48:12.78
So they can win yeah

627
00:48:13.10 --> 00:48:15.26
It's it's interesting because if you think about it

628
00:48:15.26 --> 00:48:20.46
I was talking about this yesterday like every problem that you have in an organization

629
00:48:21.18 --> 00:48:26.46
Is going to be solved by leadership that's it that's it that's what it's going to get solved by every problem that is in an organization

630
00:48:26.46 --> 00:48:31.18
It's going to be solved by leadership. I don't care if it's because you miss numbers. I don't care if you got bad process

631
00:48:31.18 --> 00:48:33.18
I don't care if you got wrong people in wrong positions

632
00:48:33.74 --> 00:48:37.58
All those problems are all about leadership because if you got a bad process

633
00:48:37.58 --> 00:48:42.54
There's a leader that's allowing that process to be in place if you've got bad people then there's a leader that's not

634
00:48:43.10 --> 00:48:47.10
Either training those people are getting rid of those people and if your P and L is upside down

635
00:48:47.10 --> 00:48:49.34
There's a leader that is not paying attention to the numbers

636
00:48:49.34 --> 00:48:53.10
So all these problems are going to be leadership problems. So if you want to improve your business

637
00:48:53.10 --> 00:48:55.10
Well, then what you need to do is improve your leadership

638
00:48:55.10 --> 00:48:58.86
Now I will say this as well. I just got to make like a little caveat here

639
00:48:59.42 --> 00:49:03.02
Because you just talked about the value of it if you're out there in the world and

640
00:49:03.66 --> 00:49:08.30
You can't afford to come to the master which I understand the master's expensive it costs us a lot to put together

641
00:49:08.30 --> 00:49:11.18
I had somebody hit me up like hey

642
00:49:11.18 --> 00:49:13.74
It sounds like you care about more about making money

643
00:49:13.90 --> 00:49:16.14
I was like no, no, no, we we definitely want to make money

644
00:49:16.38 --> 00:49:20.38
That's what that's what we are business and we need to make money and we need to pay our team

645
00:49:20.38 --> 00:49:25.82
And so yeah, we are we're gonna make money and the master's expensive it costs a lot of money if you can afford to come to the master

646
00:49:27.34 --> 00:49:33.18
Don't come to the master if you can't don't go out and borrow money to come to the master no you you're not

647
00:49:33.74 --> 00:49:37.58
You know don't skip a mortgage payment so you can come to the master. That's not a good idea

648
00:49:37.90 --> 00:49:39.42
What you do is you

649
00:49:39.42 --> 00:49:43.74
Implement some financial discipline you start saving money you put it together and you can come to the next master

650
00:49:44.54 --> 00:49:45.74
By the way

651
00:49:45.74 --> 00:49:49.18
If you can afford the master you can get a book called extreme ownership

652
00:49:49.18 --> 00:49:55.98
It costs 16 97 on Amazon. That's fine. We this podcast is free. There's

653
00:49:56.78 --> 00:50:01.18
400 something hours of us talking about this kind of thing so you can do that

654
00:50:01.98 --> 00:50:02.94
Like I said

655
00:50:02.94 --> 00:50:07.50
Wait if you can come to the master that's when you're gonna get basically a private jujitsu lesson

656
00:50:07.50 --> 00:50:11.18
You're gonna learn really granular things you're gonna get the interaction face to face

657
00:50:11.18 --> 00:50:16.86
You're gonna get to ask the specific questions about your world and you're gonna interact with people that are on the same path as you that's awesome

658
00:50:16.86 --> 00:50:22.30
If you can come come, we'll see you at the master. That no green room thing

659
00:50:23.26 --> 00:50:28.14
And we've talked about that before but that's that's a big deal. That's a bigger deal than it might seem

660
00:50:28.70 --> 00:50:32.38
Because you know how like I you said like okay you have a Q and a part or

661
00:50:33.26 --> 00:50:38.86
You know like you have a specific question like hey that was cool what you just said but what about you know like some people have questions

662
00:50:39.50 --> 00:50:41.50
So during the break

663
00:50:41.50 --> 00:50:47.50
When most times like at these conventions or whatever they got the you know the people they'll they'll say they're what they have to send

664
00:50:47.50 --> 00:50:52.86
And they'll go and they'll disappear straight up this thing. You're gonna come or something. Yeah, whatever grapes whatever and

665
00:50:53.82 --> 00:50:59.98
But here it's like people like hey that question that I had now I can go run and go go grab labor

666
00:50:59.98 --> 00:51:04.70
Dock or whatever and ask it like personally. Yeah, it's what we have when during the break

667
00:51:04.70 --> 00:51:11.74
Late for night we're on stage. Yeah, the break we say okay take a break come back in 12 minutes. We step down off the stage

668
00:51:11.74 --> 00:51:16.14
And we stand right there and people just come and ask us more questions and we can you talk and and sometimes

669
00:51:16.14 --> 00:51:17.42
Somebody asked such a good question

670
00:51:17.42 --> 00:51:20.70
We're like bring it back and we're back on stage and say hey someone just asked this question

671
00:51:21.02 --> 00:51:25.58
Here's the question. It's a great question. It's a whole time. Yeah, all the time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, even look

672
00:51:25.58 --> 00:51:28.46
I mean the and this would happen to me a lot for some reason

673
00:51:28.70 --> 00:51:33.98
I think I know well I guess I kind of know a little bit of a common ask you the leadership question always okay game like in the hallway

674
00:51:33.98 --> 00:51:36.62
You know, I think that's the thing to do and that's the choice

675
00:51:36.62 --> 00:51:38.46
And you want to just kind of choose a little bit

676
00:51:39.58 --> 00:51:43.90
That's I was gonna say that's one of the other primaries to come to muster's echo Charles is gonna be there

677
00:51:43.90 --> 00:51:49.66
And I want of these days are gonna get you on stage for a keynote presentation sure and it's gonna be awesome

678
00:51:50.38 --> 00:51:52.38
You're gonna be right right in your comfort zone

679
00:51:52.38 --> 00:51:54.38
I'm getting flanked

680
00:51:54.38 --> 00:51:55.02
All right

681
00:51:55.02 --> 00:51:59.82
Moving on those are the three questions about the monster, but they got asked so here

682
00:51:59.82 --> 00:52:07.98
Knowing what you know about war and the teams if you could go back in time what would you have done differently

683
00:52:10.30 --> 00:52:12.30
Man, I wish I could go back in time

684
00:52:13.10 --> 00:52:15.10
Day Birken hour doing an event

685
00:52:15.98 --> 00:52:17.98
Early this week and

686
00:52:18.22 --> 00:52:24.22
He was he he said you know, I'm glad I'm not a Romadi. I know, Dave probably wish he was a Romadi a 100%

687
00:52:24.22 --> 00:52:26.22
I would go there right now. Let's go

688
00:52:27.58 --> 00:52:29.58
and look it's

689
00:52:29.58 --> 00:52:31.98
What I would do differently is the recognition that

690
00:52:33.34 --> 00:52:35.74
We were super aggressive we took a lot of risk

691
00:52:38.62 --> 00:52:44.14
What I would do differently is I would actually be even more aggressive. I would be a hundred times more aggressive

692
00:52:44.46 --> 00:52:46.14
I would be putting up you know a

693
00:52:46.38 --> 00:52:52.62
Concept of the operations brief for your for your approval to send up the chain to swim across the river and

694
00:52:53.02 --> 00:52:57.18
Hit targets and and you know put in some cyber overwatches and just

695
00:52:57.18 --> 00:53:04.14
Completely ruin the bad guys program going on in South Central my when they had complete freedom movement before they had any

696
00:53:04.30 --> 00:53:07.02
Expectation that we could be there before you back get to us and I think

697
00:53:07.66 --> 00:53:13.10
They would never see a common which means that we would have more impact and it would actually be safer for us

698
00:53:13.58 --> 00:53:18.46
Because they wouldn't be expecting it so they would probably hammers, but we we recognized that we could get away with a lot more

699
00:53:19.26 --> 00:53:22.06
You know then then we could and looking back on it. I just

700
00:53:22.54 --> 00:53:25.82
When you when you come into an area and they're like hey don't go in there you're all gonna get killed

701
00:53:25.82 --> 00:53:30.54
You you want to be cautious you want to you don't want to just jump into things you want to mitigate

702
00:53:30.62 --> 00:53:31.98
Risk you can control certainly

703
00:53:32.22 --> 00:53:34.62
But we recognize we could get away with a lot more

704
00:53:35.18 --> 00:53:38.94
That then we thought we could and and more often they're not bring bring guys at home

705
00:53:38.94 --> 00:53:43.42
And of course that's the one thing I would change obviously if I could change if I would trade places with

706
00:53:43.82 --> 00:53:46.46
Mark Lee and Ryan Joe in my opportunity in a second

707
00:53:46.46 --> 00:53:55.34
I trade places with Mike Montzure and Delta 2 in a second and I know wish I could do that and I can't but that is the that is what I would change

708
00:53:56.62 --> 00:53:59.50
But I certainly would if we could go back there again

709
00:53:59.50 --> 00:54:02.70
We would be even more aggressive and we'd have even more impact

710
00:54:03.66 --> 00:54:07.58
There's a term that that they used to say in the teams. I don't know if you ever heard it

711
00:54:07.58 --> 00:54:13.02
You probably did when we would be doing special reconnaissance training and guys would say trust your camouflage

712
00:54:13.26 --> 00:54:15.26
Did you ever hear that expression?

713
00:54:15.26 --> 00:54:21.82
I don't I don't believe so so what it was was when you got good at putting your camouflage together

714
00:54:21.82 --> 00:54:25.50
You could really get aggressive in getting up and observing a target

715
00:54:25.98 --> 00:54:32.70
Because if you trust your cam if you've done a good job with your cammy paint your gilly suit and and putting yourself together

716
00:54:32.70 --> 00:54:36.62
Well the enemy's not gonna be able to see you but it's really weird to be you know

717
00:54:36.62 --> 00:54:44.78
40 meters from a target that you're looking at then there's a guy walking around and you feel completely naked like they can see but they can't see you at all

718
00:54:45.02 --> 00:54:50.14
They can't see you at all and so it takes some time to learn to trust your camouflage

719
00:54:50.14 --> 00:54:55.10
And I think you know obviously hindsight is 2020 and when you look back at your body like

720
00:54:56.06 --> 00:55:00.14
You look back and you think yourself we could have done this and we could have done that we could have gotten closer to that target

721
00:55:00.14 --> 00:55:05.74
We could have done more things because our hindsight's 2020 and also we learned over time to trust our camouflage

722
00:55:05.74 --> 00:55:11.26
And the longer we were there the the the more aggressive you know operations took place

723
00:55:11.66 --> 00:55:15.58
But yeah, let's hindsight's 2020 isn't it?

724
00:55:16.70 --> 00:55:18.70
That it is

725
00:55:19.26 --> 00:55:21.26
Okay

726
00:55:22.30 --> 00:55:25.02
Advice on restarting your life after the military

727
00:55:29.02 --> 00:55:33.18
I think you just got to figure out what you want to do yeah, you got to figure out what you haven't even knew monster that I tell people now

728
00:55:33.18 --> 00:55:38.86
It's a find your next mission and that's what you got to do and I got I got really lucky because

729
00:55:39.26 --> 00:55:46.86
We got right into this and you you the same thing like we we went right into a new mission and so any time to kind of

730
00:55:47.34 --> 00:55:51.10
Wander round and look around and figure out which direction to go and by the way

731
00:55:51.10 --> 00:55:53.74
When you're wandering on and looking around to find out which direction to go

732
00:55:53.74 --> 00:55:58.46
You're gonna get pulled into the direction and that direction is probably gonna be the path of least resistance. It's not gonna be a good path

733
00:55:59.02 --> 00:56:01.02
We certainly know it's not gonna be deep

734
00:56:01.02 --> 00:56:07.10
So when you come out when you get out of the military man have a mission figure out which one next mission is gonna be

735
00:56:07.10 --> 00:56:13.50
But I I would disagree with you there and that it wasn't that we'd got lucky right in that and that if you think about what we're doing now

736
00:56:13.50 --> 00:56:16.14
This is what we like to do and this is what we we we

737
00:56:17.10 --> 00:56:19.10
We brought lessons back from money that we

738
00:56:20.14 --> 00:56:25.18
We translated and gave to the next generation of seals and and saw the impact that was ever

739
00:56:25.18 --> 00:56:28.70
I mean when you when you came back from out you could have had any any job that you wanted to

740
00:56:28.70 --> 00:56:34.30
And you said I want to go run training attachment because I want to make sure that the the next

741
00:56:35.18 --> 00:56:37.90
Seals that are coming through this training and going forward to places like a brakjai

742
00:56:37.90 --> 00:56:39.10
Afghanistan are ready

743
00:56:39.10 --> 00:56:44.22
You chose to do that and and I was running the training program that that's I would I didn't want to be anywhere else

744
00:56:44.22 --> 00:56:49.66
And that it was awesome and I recognize how powerful that was and the kind of reward it brought to me to see

745
00:56:49.98 --> 00:56:54.14
These young officers go out there that I put the training and succeed on incredibly difficult

746
00:56:54.14 --> 00:56:59.66
Dangerous battlefields in different areas that that I've been to so you know we we took that and recognized like

747
00:56:59.98 --> 00:57:05.50
This is something that that that that is useful it has impact and and that we can do for others

748
00:57:05.50 --> 00:57:10.62
So I think that's it was absolutely not the pack of least resistance and I got you know

749
00:57:10.62 --> 00:57:15.74
We had job offer offers that people thought people thought I was completely crazy a

750
00:57:15.98 --> 00:57:17.82
Buddy mine was like come work for me

751
00:57:17.82 --> 00:57:23.02
We'll pay you know this huge salary that was you know triple what my navy salary was and I said

752
00:57:23.02 --> 00:57:26.70
I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna start my own business. I mean he looked at me like I was nuts

753
00:57:26.94 --> 00:57:31.98
Yeah, we were talking about yesterday because we weren't making a lot of money at the beginning of echelon front now

754
00:57:33.26 --> 00:57:37.42
Yeah, we we we had to put together we were writing checks and paying for

755
00:57:37.90 --> 00:57:43.66
Things and traveling on our own dime to to go and talk to companies and for free for free

756
00:57:43.66 --> 00:57:49.42
For almost nothing yeah, and I think that's and that's really it is is finding your mission like this is what I can do

757
00:57:49.42 --> 00:57:57.34
And this is this is what I like to do and and I'm gonna figure out a way to do something that is useful at impacts people

758
00:57:57.66 --> 00:58:00.78
And I think that's that's where it is finding that next mission for sure

759
00:58:01.98 --> 00:58:04.62
Next question I like this question this this question

760
00:58:05.42 --> 00:58:10.86
Made me think that whoever wrote this question has a good feel for like kind of the whole thing here

761
00:58:10.86 --> 00:58:12.86
So the question was

762
00:58:12.86 --> 00:58:17.98
This question to life what's jocos most impactful strategy on you?

763
00:58:17.98 --> 00:58:19.98
When he says

764
00:58:20.54 --> 00:58:22.54
Lath gets real fired up

765
00:58:24.46 --> 00:58:30.94
Definitely someone who's been listening a lot of podcasts or maybe he's coming to the bus to hurt us speak or talk before because jocot talks about

766
00:58:31.34 --> 00:58:37.98
Angry lady life and really I can get angry. That's like hothead, right? Basically be a little bit of a hothead

767
00:58:37.98 --> 00:58:42.38
I can definitely be a hothead. You can be a lot of bit of hothead sometimes. I can't and usually I mean

768
00:58:42.38 --> 00:58:43.18
I I

769
00:58:43.18 --> 00:58:43.58
I

770
00:58:43.58 --> 00:58:44.86
I like to think that it takes me

771
00:58:44.86 --> 00:58:49.50
I don't immediately spin up all things, but once I get spun up I get I get a really spun up and

772
00:58:50.14 --> 00:58:56.46
I don't know if you disagree with no, no, I was gonna ask you if is is is house having two kids

773
00:58:57.34 --> 00:58:59.34
For sure that that teaches you some

774
00:59:00.06 --> 00:59:05.02
Temper control big time big time and it and particularly when you know when when there's there's timelines

775
00:59:05.02 --> 00:59:07.66
You're trying to meet and we're trying to run a business. I don't have time

776
00:59:07.66 --> 00:59:09.66
They don't

777
00:59:09.66 --> 00:59:16.14
The timeline is now I want some crayons now and what I would love is I love spending time with my son and

778
00:59:17.42 --> 00:59:20.86
My daughter and they're awesome kids and particularly my son now he's three is old enough to count

779
00:59:20.86 --> 00:59:24.70
You know, he's in the game. Yeah, we'll go. We'll go somewhere and do something fun or

780
00:59:25.26 --> 00:59:30.38
We're hanging out and it doesn't matter if that's five minutes long or five hours long like when it's time to leave

781
00:59:30.86 --> 00:59:34.70
It's level 19 meltdown every time, right and he's

782
00:59:35.26 --> 00:59:37.74
I'm waiting for the time is like dad. Thank you for the time

783
00:59:37.74 --> 00:59:42.78
This really fun doesn't happen so so yeah that that actually instills and you some

784
00:59:43.74 --> 00:59:48.30
Spatience some patience, but it's the we always talk about red flags and that's something that I learned from you

785
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:54.62
And that and I know you were looking at for me to see like oh some red flags are going off red flags

786
00:59:54.62 --> 00:59:57.50
Are those things that as you talked about often you recognize

787
00:59:58.22 --> 01:00:00.94
In yourself like okay, I'm getting spun up right now

788
01:00:00.94 --> 01:00:04.86
I need to take a step back here and and and throttle back

789
01:00:04.86 --> 01:00:10.14
I knew throttle back or because I'm getting spun up so so with kids I got a look at it as you know what this is good

790
01:00:10.22 --> 01:00:14.38
Because because I know that some of it's in my nature that I can get spun up so with kids

791
01:00:14.70 --> 01:00:21.02
I got to relish that opportunity to say this is a training opportunity for me to be outside my comfort zone to say you know what

792
01:00:21.58 --> 01:00:27.34
I feel myself getting spun up. I'm gonna practice attaching and spinning down and not not reacting in a way that I might otherwise

793
01:00:27.34 --> 01:00:31.50
Would have and I think it's a great. It's a great tool there really for me

794
01:00:31.50 --> 01:00:38.14
I think what the when Jocco would sense that in me and we talked about a number of times when that's happened here on the podcast

795
01:00:38.46 --> 01:00:41.98
That I was getting spun up, you know, we talked about you know previous

796
01:00:43.10 --> 01:00:51.50
In previous podcast about cancel the hop at some of these things where I you know, I just I would get fired really and get angry and and you

797
01:00:51.82 --> 01:00:56.30
What most people would have done that situation what I probably would have done to a subordinate leader is get is

798
01:00:57.34 --> 01:01:00.86
Get spun up as well and like you yell at me now

799
01:01:00.86 --> 01:01:07.34
I'm gonna yell at you, but a little bit louder exactly and I was gonna ramp up and it becomes like the Battle of Wills and how you

800
01:01:07.34 --> 01:01:12.22
Hand you handled that except as well with me was generally you would you would never get spun up you would just

801
01:01:12.70 --> 01:01:18.38
Be very calm your response and you would ask questions or in some cases you would just start chuckling like

802
01:01:19.58 --> 01:01:23.62
Laughing about it like hey, then you get spun and not not in a way that's condescending you're not like

803
01:01:23.62 --> 01:01:29.46
Oh, look at you you idiot. Yeah, it was in a way you want a laughing people when they're getting mad. Yeah, it was in a way that hey man

804
01:01:30.98 --> 01:01:36.10
Take it easy. Yeah, just take it easy and then you start laughing and it was and then it just that was something that was

805
01:01:36.34 --> 01:01:39.30
But would you ask questions in a way that we're hey? Well

806
01:01:40.42 --> 01:01:44.82
Why do you think this or and those think that was powerful as well to me that wasn't it wasn't

807
01:01:45.22 --> 01:01:51.46
Like hey, why are you doing this or why won't you listen to me and and it was that always allowed me to kind of take a step back and recognize

808
01:01:51.46 --> 01:01:55.30
Okay, so so I think you you got to make sure you see a red flag at somebody else

809
01:01:55.30 --> 01:02:00.82
They're getting spun up and they're really emotional you need to be unemotional and you need to you need to check your ego to

810
01:02:00.82 --> 01:02:05.74
To do an end around I'd never see anybody do that before you did exceptionally well

811
01:02:06.34 --> 01:02:10.26
Against me and and I learned a lot from that because I recognize like I got to do that better

812
01:02:10.26 --> 01:02:15.30
I didn't never it just doesn't benefit you from getting spun up and angry and and I'll tell you one thing that's

813
01:02:16.34 --> 01:02:18.90
Another little thing that I noticed that I do for sure is

814
01:02:18.90 --> 01:02:22.66
If someone comes at me and they're super mad about something

815
01:02:23.54 --> 01:02:25.94
I can't just be a hundred percent calm

816
01:02:26.42 --> 01:02:30.50
Because if if you come in the room and you go chocolate scrap the

817
01:02:31.22 --> 01:02:35.94
We're getting told to do this thing over in this total crap we should be able to do this and if I go

818
01:02:37.14 --> 01:02:40.74
Leave just calm down. It's not that big of a deal like right there

819
01:02:40.74 --> 01:02:44.90
I've already taken right because you're like what are you talking about? I try that with my wife

820
01:02:44.90 --> 01:02:50.74
Jenna yeah, I'm saying it doesn't work. Yeah, the opposite what you have is you have to be you have to show some

821
01:02:51.62 --> 01:02:58.02
We'll call it a diminished reflection of the emotion that they're showing you want to you want to take a little off of it

822
01:02:58.02 --> 01:02:59.78
But you know oh my oh my

823
01:02:59.78 --> 01:03:01.78
Late for you series they're telling us to do the oh man

824
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:06.74
That's that's that's crap alright. Let's let's find out what's going on so now instead of being against you now all of a sudden

825
01:03:06.74 --> 01:03:08.66
I'm on your side I've calm down a little bit

826
01:03:08.66 --> 01:03:13.30
I brought you down a little bit but you at least recognize that I'm on your side because if I just if I just say

827
01:03:13.30 --> 01:03:15.86
Rave calm down getting mad is not going to help

828
01:03:15.86 --> 01:03:20.10
Oh, they're like you're going to get even matter or if I say you need to think about what they're saying

829
01:03:20.10 --> 01:03:22.42
No, no, I need to join your side first

830
01:03:22.82 --> 01:03:27.22
One time on your side now we can talk and we can move through the problem effectively

831
01:03:27.62 --> 01:03:33.22
So you might want to just show a little diminished reflection of the part of you know if someone's really sad about something

832
01:03:33.70 --> 01:03:41.62
Okay, you know you can't just be like hey, it's not that big of a deal like you know I got you're I got kids right I got I got teenage girls and you know they get sad about stuff

833
01:03:41.62 --> 01:03:46.26
Um, and I can't just you know I've tried it before like don't worry about that

834
01:03:46.58 --> 01:03:51.86
It will mean nothing in three years. I've done that but by the time you graduate high school you even think about that anymore

835
01:03:52.58 --> 01:03:57.30
Stop how does that work it doesn't work good because you realize that that's the whole world to them

836
01:03:57.30 --> 01:04:02.10
So you know instead you got to say oh man I can't believe that happened. You know that's that's that's sad

837
01:04:02.10 --> 01:04:07.14
You know, but the good thing is here's some good points about it and maybe you know what I mean? So just don't

838
01:04:07.14 --> 01:04:13.30
Be completely emotionless because then the person can't relate to the you and if they can't relate to you

839
01:04:13.30 --> 01:04:17.22
You're not gonna be able to talk about it if you can't talk about it. You're not gonna make any progress on the subject

840
01:04:19.14 --> 01:04:21.14
Careful with that one all right

841
01:04:22.02 --> 01:04:24.74
Wanna hear more HDH and Vegas?

842
01:04:24.74 --> 01:04:29.18
Do we talk about the HDH hands on one of the other podcasts? Yeah, we talked about it

843
01:04:29.18 --> 01:04:32.54
So $100 on a podcast Vegas listen to podcast 11 if you want to hear about

844
01:04:33.30 --> 01:04:35.46
Mark Lee's son our shenanigans and Vegas we did have

845
01:04:35.46 --> 01:04:40.58
There were there were a couple good stories of eggs. We you know, we that was a crazy boom

846
01:04:40.58 --> 01:04:42.18
Dog with a chip of one of them that I did

847
01:04:42.98 --> 01:04:50.90
Remember well was we had this giant convoy of humbys and we were coming up to a major intersection just off the Vegas trip

848
01:04:51.54 --> 01:04:57.08
Red light because we were driving to several knows driving we drove the the home V's to arrange to do work

849
01:04:57.62 --> 01:04:59.62
up in that area

850
01:04:59.62 --> 01:05:01.46
Is it an air force range no no

851
01:05:01.46 --> 01:05:07.66
Is there for yes, so it's a nellus range where they do training up there and we had taken the humvies from one base on

852
01:05:08.14 --> 01:05:13.46
civilian roads to another base and we'd spent the day training there and now it was time to come back to base

853
01:05:13.46 --> 01:05:19.02
So we're back on civilian roads again in a in a convoy of humvies what five trucks probably

854
01:05:19.02 --> 01:05:26.14
So five humvies and we had done a drill where we had the we I was always big on you train how you fight

855
01:05:26.14 --> 01:05:28.66
Right, so that means if we're driving home V's guess what we're doing

856
01:05:28.66 --> 01:05:34.46
We're mounting weapons we're gonna we're gonna be ready to get after it if we have to not that we're gonna have to get after it Vegas

857
01:05:34.46 --> 01:05:39.46
But we're gonna we're gonna test things because if you're not used to swing in that gun around up in the up in the turret

858
01:05:39.46 --> 01:05:43.50
Then you're not used to it so you got a practice so we were basically in

859
01:05:44.62 --> 01:05:48.02
In full kind of kit I think we actually had the whole task in it

860
01:05:48.02 --> 01:05:51.34
So I think we had like eight or ten humbys. It was it was a big big big big hum boy

861
01:05:51.34 --> 01:05:57.34
But yeah, so we come up to we're coming up to a red light start to turn yellow and the lead the lead navigator

862
01:05:57.34 --> 01:06:02.66
You know, this is a major intersection, you know two four lane roads that are coming up to

863
01:06:03.70 --> 01:06:10.62
He's he gives the command blow through which means that we're just if you get you're an ambush and people are shooting at you

864
01:06:10.62 --> 01:06:13.34
And you're just gonna keep rolling and he says blow through

865
01:06:13.82 --> 01:06:19.36
So we literally have the entire convoy behind him like running this red light in a major major intersection

866
01:06:19.36 --> 01:06:21.98
Yeah, I was like we're gonna be standing tall from yeah

867
01:06:21.98 --> 01:06:28.08
This is not going we don't want to do that because in like an Iraqi wouldn't stop at a red light or you wouldn't stop

868
01:06:28.08 --> 01:06:31.48
It stops on you you know you obviously the lead vehicle would check close enough

869
01:06:31.48 --> 01:06:34.80
And then you you're traveling really tight. You make sure there's no cars coming

870
01:06:34.80 --> 01:06:38.80
But yeah, you're just gonna blow through you're not gonna stop and so that the other call came out to blow through

871
01:06:38.80 --> 01:06:40.46
So which one didn't trouble for that?

872
01:06:40.46 --> 01:06:46.38
It would be gonna find well luckily we had some heads up drivers that stopped at the their green light and and sauce

873
01:06:46.38 --> 01:06:52.68
Coming maybe they were intimidated by guys with 50 gal machine guns and the turret, but definitely you know that's one of those things

874
01:06:52.68 --> 01:06:58.26
We're it's hard for guys to turn it off sometimes and it when you're when you're doing tactical driving on the range as if you were in

875
01:06:59.06 --> 01:07:05.68
A combat scenario and I'll be sitting here on the street. Yeah, so that again. This is a car I should have been said

876
01:07:05.68 --> 01:07:06.68
Okay guys

877
01:07:06.68 --> 01:07:09.68
We're going back on civilian roads stand down

878
01:07:09.68 --> 01:07:14.46
You know what I mean? I should have said that but I didn't say that because I'm dumb and I will we it

879
01:07:14.46 --> 01:07:20.10
We we we made the assumption which turned out to be false that people would automatically know that and they didn't

880
01:07:20.10 --> 01:07:25.98
Yeah, so we had to tighten that up, but that was just one less and learn from our biggest trick with shenanigans

881
01:07:25.98 --> 01:07:28.82
Yeah, it's good times. I'm surprised I didn't get more trouble for that

882
01:07:29.22 --> 01:07:31.22
one of the one of your guys

883
01:07:31.82 --> 01:07:36.26
We were in a he was a designated driver. We're in a navy van and

884
01:07:37.44 --> 01:07:44.26
We go from one place we we knew someone and we were out in town and we went from there to downtown to go to you know

885
01:07:44.26 --> 01:07:50.74
The bars right in Vegas. We're pulling into a parking garage and you know they have that metal pipe that says, you know

886
01:07:50.94 --> 01:07:52.70
Six foot two inch clearance

887
01:07:52.90 --> 01:07:55.30
Well whatever the clearance was it was a very low parking rush

888
01:07:55.30 --> 01:07:59.26
So he's got this big navy van. We come in and we we kind of hit that

889
01:08:00.42 --> 01:08:05.96
And I'm sitting in the back and you know what this is a classic example of a decentralized command

890
01:08:05.96 --> 01:08:08.52
I'm not gonna step on the toes the guys the designated driver

891
01:08:08.52 --> 01:08:12.78
I wasn't drink or I probably had a few drinks or whatever, but I wasn't definitely wasn't intoxicated

892
01:08:12.78 --> 01:08:14.78
And

893
01:08:14.78 --> 01:08:19.58
But I see oh like I look out and I see we kind of hit that thing and so

894
01:08:20.14 --> 01:08:27.14
We go around the corner and then we start to actually enter the parking garage and as we go underneath the first concrete beam

895
01:08:27.90 --> 01:08:29.90
The the it's

896
01:08:29.90 --> 01:08:32.38
You can hear it the scrapes against the ceiling

897
01:08:32.38 --> 01:08:35.62
But it scrapes hard and the vehicle comes to a stop and

898
01:08:36.70 --> 01:08:38.86
What is the driver do again?

899
01:08:38.86 --> 01:08:44.70
This is the designated driver what does he do he starts pressing down the gas? He's just gonna power through this

900
01:08:45.34 --> 01:08:47.90
I'm in the back. I go dude

901
01:08:47.90 --> 01:08:50.62
I'm like dude. What are you doing?

902
01:08:51.18 --> 01:08:54.86
Stop what are you gonna rip the roof off of the vehicle?

903
01:08:55.50 --> 01:08:58.78
Like back out of here and leave he's like well, I thought I could have made it

904
01:09:01.42 --> 01:09:04.62
Man one good team guys shenanigans

905
01:09:04.62 --> 01:09:08.46
That we were talking about was me you and the Delta commander

906
01:09:09.18 --> 01:09:14.22
Delta-Potent commander rolling roll and rolling up the Santa Barbara I think you actually came up to me and said

907
01:09:15.50 --> 01:09:18.14
To Naseus D. Are you gonna see to Naseus D?

908
01:09:18.14 --> 01:09:21.74
Yeah, so for those of you may not know jocco is a huge the Naseus D fan

909
01:09:22.94 --> 01:09:26.54
The D and I think that's that's how I came out you're like the D

910
01:09:26.62 --> 01:09:30.94
They're in Santa Barbara. Let's go road trip road trip road gig road gig

911
01:09:30.94 --> 01:09:37.10
So we jumped in yeah, all the things that you gave me you gave me a copy of a belt face

912
01:09:38.38 --> 01:09:41.58
My David Hackworth when we were working together to you bruiser

913
01:09:42.22 --> 01:09:48.38
At the end of our art art tour together and you gave me the the set to the DVDs to Tanesious D

914
01:09:48.38 --> 01:09:54.22
There you go and the Delta there you go. That's the dichotomy of leadership right there hackworth about face the

915
01:09:54.22 --> 01:10:02.30
Tanesious D. Yeah, so we found out Tanesious D was having a concert up in Santa Barbara you know, we're all stationed here at San Diego and and we jumped in

916
01:10:03.34 --> 01:10:05.34
Joccos

917
01:10:05.58 --> 01:10:06.54
Dodge

918
01:10:06.54 --> 01:10:08.22
1997 Dodge Grandcaravan

919
01:10:08.22 --> 01:10:11.82
1997 a lot of people just called it the Pimp wagon

920
01:10:13.10 --> 01:10:15.10
Because it was hard to keep the ladies off

921
01:10:15.10 --> 01:10:19.18
Where when you're rolling and this is there a there window was tape shot on the driver side

922
01:10:19.18 --> 01:10:25.42
It's to it's rigors tape shot hard to you working in there now. I think was shot because it's a little electrical thing broke

923
01:10:25.98 --> 01:10:29.98
So we're we're cheap bastards so we're not gonna spend the night up there

924
01:10:29.98 --> 01:10:33.34
I think we actually had a work to do maybe the next day so we jump in the van

925
01:10:34.06 --> 01:10:39.42
Joc I think you drove up there we rock out to the Tanesious D concert in Santa Barbara

926
01:10:39.66 --> 01:10:43.74
We bought Jocco a t-shirt to the Sasquatches reel

927
01:10:43.74 --> 01:10:51.10
The Sasquatches reel and I remember driving back at about there's about three o'clock in the morning

928
01:10:51.10 --> 01:10:55.98
We were like passing through camp pedal than as kind of where our ranges are there as on the way back down

929
01:10:56.38 --> 01:11:01.74
We're just aquapello singing to every Tanesious D zone that we we knew by heart

930
01:11:01.74 --> 01:11:04.70
We're gonna make a new band. It's gonna be called aquapello D

931
01:11:07.34 --> 01:11:11.50
That was a good done. Yeah, yeah, that was pretty fun. All right

932
01:11:11.50 --> 01:11:13.50
Tanesious D

933
01:11:15.34 --> 01:11:23.10
What are your daily non-negotiable habits wave-fabon my daily non-negotiable habits?

934
01:11:24.46 --> 01:11:28.30
Usually I want to sleep in about 10 30 10 30

935
01:11:28.30 --> 01:11:30.30
11 star just

936
01:11:30.70 --> 01:11:32.70
He's a donuts

937
01:11:33.10 --> 01:11:36.30
Listen, I mean I the at the end of the day just when he goes freedom

938
01:11:36.30 --> 01:11:40.54
It's a mantra that I learned from you and that it's it just absolutely true and if you got a

939
01:11:41.58 --> 01:11:44.46
You got to get up in the morning to work out on the on the there's some days

940
01:11:44.46 --> 01:11:48.30
I frankly I can't do that because life gets in a way whether I'm if I'm traveling or

941
01:11:49.58 --> 01:11:55.10
My my kid wakes up early and I know you know I've been out of town and my wife once you get to work at him before the day starts

942
01:11:55.10 --> 01:11:57.98
So I've take the kids so she can do that and we can we can rotate now

943
01:11:58.14 --> 01:12:00.46
You know, so I can't tell you that always happens

944
01:12:00.46 --> 01:12:06.30
But you gotta get up early you gotta work out and and you have to you have to prioritize an SQ and and having that

945
01:12:06.62 --> 01:12:11.50
Checklist that you put together the night before about what you want to do and what's important is is

946
01:12:11.50 --> 01:12:16.46
Absolutely critical otherwise you lose it and you know for me and Jocco and for all of us at our team

947
01:12:17.02 --> 01:12:21.74
On national front like it's when we get away from the things that that we talk about the people

948
01:12:22.06 --> 01:12:26.14
We're human beings I get everybody else and we get pulled in different directions when we get away from those things

949
01:12:26.14 --> 01:12:31.82
It doesn't work things start to fall apart. You lose you lose track of where the priorities are if I can't regularly detach

950
01:12:31.82 --> 01:12:38.78
That's something that I have to really focus on to do is is to regularly detach if I'm grinding on something for two or three or four hours at a time

951
01:12:39.18 --> 01:12:43.50
Sometimes it's easy to miss other things that are that are coming up and I got to make sure I pull away from things

952
01:12:43.50 --> 01:12:47.26
Kind of kind of think about the prior prioritizing nice QPs figure out you know

953
01:12:47.50 --> 01:12:52.38
If I need to reprioritize and and so I don't get target fixating on one thing and and keep going

954
01:12:52.38 --> 01:12:58.62
But I think for me you know, I what I want to do is I try to make time to spend time with my family as much as I can as well

955
01:12:58.62 --> 01:13:04.54
And obviously there's there's a there's a lot of work to do there always is and and it's you know those things

956
01:13:05.82 --> 01:13:11.34
The one when when I could stay consistent on getting up early in the morning and getting to work out in

957
01:13:11.42 --> 01:13:15.66
You know stay focused on a list that I have from the night before that I'm falling through all the things that you talk about

958
01:13:16.46 --> 01:13:19.90
That's I'm I'm performing better than I ever do

959
01:13:19.90 --> 01:13:27.10
All the time you win it works and the end of the end is what works and then what doesn't where yeah, that's how you win check

960
01:13:28.22 --> 01:13:32.22
Tell us about a time you were annoyed with jocco or his intensity

961
01:13:36.38 --> 01:13:38.38
annoyed with jocco or his intensity

962
01:13:40.46 --> 01:13:44.54
You know what we we got along pretty damn well together and and I think

963
01:13:44.54 --> 01:13:50.78
There's not there's not really any time that comes to mind that I was annoyed by you

964
01:13:50.78 --> 01:13:56.22
Except for maybe you know what what we mentioned earlier right when the times when initially we're working together and you're looking over my shoulder

965
01:13:56.62 --> 01:14:00.54
And and tell me to do like we should do this way. Let's let's let's point it like that

966
01:14:01.10 --> 01:14:06.94
I definitely got a note from that time when I felt like I want to run my you know everyone's trying to tell me what to do here

967
01:14:07.18 --> 01:14:11.42
And jocco's looking over my shoulder. I want to run run my team just just explained earlier

968
01:14:11.42 --> 01:14:16.78
And and I didn't realize until later like what you were doing and like hey you're you're passing

969
01:14:17.02 --> 01:14:18.54
You're passing all on a great information

970
01:14:18.54 --> 01:14:21.02
I see that all the time actually with people

971
01:14:21.58 --> 01:14:26.30
Because if I could have detached from that situation I would have recognized like hey I'm a new political commander

972
01:14:26.30 --> 01:14:28.94
I've never been a particular commander jocco was just a political commander

973
01:14:28.94 --> 01:14:30.94
He had a highly successful political commander tour

974
01:14:30.94 --> 01:14:35.58
He had a historic deployment where he did a whole bunch of operations and he's got a ton of lessons learned

975
01:14:35.58 --> 01:14:38.70
So what an amazing opportunity to learn everything from him

976
01:14:38.70 --> 01:14:44.06
But that's not the way you approach it right it's like ego my ego and I see that all the time

977
01:14:44.06 --> 01:14:49.26
I mean there was a leader a leader. I was dealing with where I was talking to a member of the board

978
01:14:50.22 --> 01:14:56.06
For this particular leader who was constantly bucking against the you know this guys and it was it's amazing to me

979
01:14:56.06 --> 01:15:00.06
Though to see like hey the the CEO of this company his pushing back against the member of the board like

980
01:15:00.62 --> 01:15:06.62
He should be so thankful that the member of the board has who has got massive amounts of experience

981
01:15:06.62 --> 01:15:11.74
Extraordinary success is there to mentor and train him and yet he doesn't want to listen to that guy

982
01:15:11.74 --> 01:15:17.34
I want to do it myself you're always over my shoulder it said to me like hey man open up the legal pad

983
01:15:17.50 --> 01:15:21.50
Let's take some notes here. I want to pick your brain for everything. I want to you know

984
01:15:21.50 --> 01:15:26.94
It's and and I think just recognize if you're feeling that way and you're frustrated with with somebody who's

985
01:15:27.42 --> 01:15:31.66
Looking over your shoulder then then you need to take advantage of the situation to learn from them

986
01:15:32.22 --> 01:15:36.38
And certainly build up trust the boy the way to get out of that situation the build-up trust that show

987
01:15:36.38 --> 01:15:41.74
That you you're learning you're growing and and that you don't need someone to look up your shoulder every second and usually that comes

988
01:15:42.14 --> 01:15:43.66
Even after we got

989
01:15:43.66 --> 01:15:48.54
Forward and you just unleashed us on the battlefield. I would always come to you

990
01:15:48.54 --> 01:15:51.02
I mean I hate jacquad what do you think about this we're gonna do this situation

991
01:15:51.02 --> 01:15:53.26
I wasn't looking to you to tell me what to do

992
01:15:53.74 --> 01:15:57.26
But I was running things by you and and we do that all the time now that's not front

993
01:15:57.26 --> 01:16:00.78
I call jacquad was a hey here's what's going on I'm working on this leader

994
01:16:01.26 --> 01:16:05.66
You do the same I mean we we talk about these things all the time and well and that it's actually that

995
01:16:05.66 --> 01:16:10.62
What's what's interesting about that is that in the last six months that idea has really become

996
01:16:10.94 --> 01:16:15.50
formalized in the tank which is where we take the companies that we're working with and

997
01:16:16.70 --> 01:16:21.38
We whoever's working specifically with us with a specific company on the ground is

998
01:16:21.98 --> 01:16:28.30
Coming back to the tank all all the echelon front team and we we get on the call or the Skype or

999
01:16:28.54 --> 01:16:33.26
The conference room and we go through all the issues that all these different companies are happening

1000
01:16:33.26 --> 01:16:37.18
And that's where we solve the problems is in the tank so that way we get everyone's input and

1001
01:16:37.90 --> 01:16:39.90
Not only do you give the best solution to the client?

1002
01:16:40.06 --> 01:16:45.34
We also all learn from it so that we have that solution in our head so it'd be we all get stronger and better

1003
01:16:45.34 --> 01:16:51.46
So that's that's one of the evolutions in our salon front that's pretty awesome to see is what started off as just like how we would run

1004
01:16:51.46 --> 01:16:57.26
T you bruiser which is hey we're gonna bounce ideas off his other and hey I don't know how to solve this problem to you or

1005
01:16:57.26 --> 01:17:03.34
Hey, I don't know how to do this operation to you or this is what I think what do you think which is the way a team should work together and

1006
01:17:03.90 --> 01:17:12.74
Now what we do is we get to do that for other companies use the same brain power use the same methodology and it's it's awesome to do and it's awesome to see it is awesome

1007
01:17:13.38 --> 01:17:15.74
The tank yeah getting in the tank

1008
01:17:17.34 --> 01:17:22.46
All right, Lave you were for those of you don't know Lafos a ship driver for how many years before you so

1009
01:17:22.46 --> 01:17:27.42
Lave you never look at me didn't get picked up for seal teams right out didn't get picked up for buds right out of the naval academy

1010
01:17:27.42 --> 01:17:28.94
So he had to go to a ship

1011
01:17:28.94 --> 01:17:31.50
Here's a question about not about that specifically, but

1012
01:17:32.46 --> 01:17:36.54
Lave what are your thoughts on a ship's captain being relieved of command and

1013
01:17:37.34 --> 01:17:39.58
What to do if you are involved and

1014
01:17:40.22 --> 01:17:47.86
He would like to know from the ships captains perspective that is being relieved because of the mistakes of your crew

1015
01:17:47.86 --> 01:17:53.34
Or if you're in the crew and the captains getting really even though you made the mistakes. What are your perspectives on that?

1016
01:17:54.82 --> 01:17:55.82
Well

1017
01:17:55.82 --> 01:18:00.80
Look I just to get people some background that I know we and I've talked about my background on podcast 11

1018
01:18:00.80 --> 01:18:03.78
But but it was I never wanted to be a ship driver. I want to be a seal

1019
01:18:03.78 --> 01:18:10.14
That's why I went to the Naval Academy. I got thrust in that position looking back on it was it was an amazing opportunity for me

1020
01:18:10.14 --> 01:18:15.14
Is a young man to have to be in those leadership positions and I enjoyed my time on this ship

1021
01:18:15.14 --> 01:18:20.02
Is a warship cost to build a billion a billion a couple of billion dollars crazy so you're you're you're

1022
01:18:20.50 --> 01:18:26.90
Sometimes you're the guy right you're a lieutenant JG on the bridge of a two billion dollars ship and you're in charge of all

1023
01:18:26.90 --> 01:18:31.94
When you're the officer of the deck you're the guy in charge of captains a sleep right in his cabin

1024
01:18:31.94 --> 01:18:37.02
And he's got a full faith in trust in you and you're running the ship and so there's the question right there

1025
01:18:37.02 --> 01:18:42.62
Sometimes the captains a ship a sleep in the cabin and he runs and and in the crew runs the ship a ground

1026
01:18:42.62 --> 01:18:48.54
The captain gets fired. What do you think about that that is the Navy way? It's it's always been that way

1027
01:18:49.10 --> 01:18:55.34
And I think it's 100% correct because there are no bad teams only bad leaders and I think that if you have

1028
01:18:56.38 --> 01:18:59.18
Even if the captain wasn't in direct responsibility

1029
01:18:59.34 --> 01:19:05.94
It's his job to train that team it's his job to mentor that team and if he's got questions about whether or not somebody is

1030
01:19:06.74 --> 01:19:08.74
Has the capability to do that job?

1031
01:19:08.74 --> 01:19:14.90
Then then they shouldn't be in that position. It's up. It's up to the the captain now the captain can't be everywhere

1032
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:19.54
It wants to its decentralized command. He has to rely on his leaders, but it's

1033
01:19:21.22 --> 01:19:23.22
It's definitely

1034
01:19:23.22 --> 01:19:27.70
I think ultimately the the captain is responsible and that's really what makes stream ownership say

1035
01:19:27.70 --> 01:19:29.46
How do client ask me a question yesterday?

1036
01:19:30.66 --> 01:19:34.90
Have you ever sent anyone to do something that they weren't ready to do?

1037
01:19:34.90 --> 01:19:38.18
I thought about it for a minute and

1038
01:19:39.30 --> 01:19:41.30
The first thought was

1039
01:19:41.46 --> 01:19:44.98
Well, of course the second thought was no the

1040
01:19:45.38 --> 01:19:47.06
Real answer is it's gray area right?

1041
01:19:47.38 --> 01:19:55.46
Did I ever send somebody to do something that they weren't 100% if I put this quantification on a hundred percent ready for it all the time all the time?

1042
01:19:56.82 --> 01:20:02.50
How often did I send somebody to do something that they weren't capable of doing the answer is zero?

1043
01:20:02.50 --> 01:20:08.34
In other words, if you weren't capable of doing this and I didn't trust that you could make it happen

1044
01:20:08.34 --> 01:20:14.26
I wasn't gonna let you do it that'd be irresponsible for me as a leader to let a subordinate go and do something that they're not ready to do that's it period

1045
01:20:14.58 --> 01:20:18.42
Or they're not 100% ready to do or they're not not not 100% put them not capable of doing

1046
01:20:18.66 --> 01:20:21.86
But I mean when we first got to the body in your mind

1047
01:20:22.34 --> 01:20:25.38
You probably weren't 100% ready to go out there and execute

1048
01:20:25.38 --> 01:20:33.30
In particular because we've been training for a mission with just seals, you know for for for roll-up assaults or direct action raids

1049
01:20:33.46 --> 01:20:39.14
You know that at nighttime and all of a sudden we're shifting to daytime canter sergy operations working with Iraqi soldiers

1050
01:20:39.78 --> 01:20:45.30
Completely different mission broken up in all these different units. We hadn't trained we hadn't trained like that in a violent war zone, by the way

1051
01:20:45.78 --> 01:20:46.82
but

1052
01:20:46.82 --> 01:20:47.54
I

1053
01:20:47.54 --> 01:20:50.66
You know, I had trust that you were completely

1054
01:20:50.66 --> 01:20:57.06
Competent and capable of doing that and if I didn't think that and I didn't think you were competent or I didn't think you were capable

1055
01:20:57.30 --> 01:21:04.58
Then I would I would be a bad leader if I said yeah, go ahead and go to go do that and then I answered the question further to this client

1056
01:21:04.58 --> 01:21:08.66
I said there was two people from tasking at bruiser that didn't go on to plan it with us

1057
01:21:09.62 --> 01:21:14.02
Because they weren't capable of doing that job. So yes, you as a leader you're responsible and I was thinking about this

1058
01:21:14.02 --> 01:21:18.58
There's been times where Navy ships have run a ground and the captain wasn't even on board

1059
01:21:18.58 --> 01:21:23.62
He had flown to somewhere to go do a meeting somewhere the ship runs a ground guess what still getting fired

1060
01:21:24.26 --> 01:21:29.94
Because you left someone in charge that you left that team you didn't train them well enough and you can make all the excuses you want

1061
01:21:29.94 --> 01:21:34.02
I wasn't there. Yeah. Well guess what you're still getting fired because you were responsible for that team

1062
01:21:34.42 --> 01:21:38.26
I think part of that too is the understanding you know what no bad teams on bad leaders

1063
01:21:38.58 --> 01:21:43.62
With the chapter two we wrote you know an extreme ownership is about the part of that is

1064
01:21:44.02 --> 01:21:46.82
I have seen some people that misinterpret that right to say well

1065
01:21:46.82 --> 01:21:50.18
I got a bad leader so the team's not good that that's not a excuse

1066
01:21:50.18 --> 01:21:54.42
So when we're talking about leadership we're talking about leaders at every level of the organization

1067
01:21:54.42 --> 01:21:59.30
So so you know if you're if you're if you're a department head on that ship or a division officer

1068
01:21:59.30 --> 01:22:03.78
A division chief and you say oh, I got a bad I got a bad commanding officer

1069
01:22:03.78 --> 01:22:08.34
It's all the commanding officer's fault our ship doesn't doesn't perform the way it should whatever your team is

1070
01:22:08.74 --> 01:22:13.78
That's not an excuse. You you got to do your utmost to get your team ready to train others around you

1071
01:22:13.78 --> 01:22:19.94
And and lead that team as much as you possibly can and you don't have to be the senior guy in charge and often some of the best units

1072
01:22:19.94 --> 01:22:24.58
We work with and we're part of the senior guy may not he may not have been the guy driving the operations

1073
01:22:24.74 --> 01:22:28.82
But he allowed his leaders to to go out and execute and and make it happen so

1074
01:22:29.22 --> 01:22:32.10
The leadership we're talking we're talking leaders at every level of the organization

1075
01:22:32.10 --> 01:22:34.10
It's not an excuse to put the blame on the boss

1076
01:22:34.82 --> 01:22:41.78
You got to step up you got to lead and own your team solve problems get better learn from mistakes and make it happen

1077
01:22:41.78 --> 01:22:46.02
What does it mean when a ship runs a ground mean literally hits dirt

1078
01:22:48.26 --> 01:22:54.02
Yeah, well in this case we're talking ship collisions. Yeah, so running a ground is one thing the

1079
01:22:55.78 --> 01:23:00.26
You know, and there's an argument to be said like because some of our greatest leaders like

1080
01:23:00.90 --> 01:23:05.70
Admiral fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz who was the hero the Pacific war was off-court to him

1081
01:23:05.94 --> 01:23:07.94
You know on this on this podcast previously

1082
01:23:07.94 --> 01:23:13.86
He was the commander chief of all US forces in the Pacific so he was he was the the the person

1083
01:23:14.42 --> 01:23:18.74
Responsible for the entire war effort against the Japanese in World War II and that victory

1084
01:23:19.78 --> 01:23:22.42
A massive effort obviously in an extraordinary turnaround

1085
01:23:23.06 --> 01:23:25.54
From from this assur to to victory

1086
01:23:26.26 --> 01:23:30.50
He actually ran a ship a ground as as a junior officer, so so there's you know

1087
01:23:30.50 --> 01:23:35.62
There's an argument to be made that there is no full you know the flawless performance it doesn't exist and people make mistakes

1088
01:23:35.62 --> 01:23:39.06
You can learn from it, you know as far as ships running around

1089
01:23:39.94 --> 01:23:43.22
You know that that's one thing. I think you know you can make a careful evaluation

1090
01:23:43.46 --> 01:23:47.62
What we're talking about here that is specifically it's a ship collisions and you know

1091
01:23:48.10 --> 01:23:50.98
Those should not happen that just that should not happen

1092
01:23:50.98 --> 01:23:54.82
I understand how easily that can happen because it there's a these are huge

1093
01:23:55.46 --> 01:24:00.90
Machines that go very fast and you're out on the ocean with other other other ships that are moving around

1094
01:24:01.14 --> 01:24:02.34
And there's a whole lot of danger

1095
01:24:02.34 --> 01:24:08.18
And it takes some of those big ships takes miles to stop them like even if you see and you go okay hit all full breaks right now

1096
01:24:08.18 --> 01:24:10.34
It doesn't matter you're you're still gonna hit absolutely

1097
01:24:10.34 --> 01:24:15.30
You know you're gonna get hit for like 10 minutes. Yep. You know if you can't stop it just brace for impact

1098
01:24:15.46 --> 01:24:17.78
Yeah, but but if you've got you got the right team in place

1099
01:24:17.86 --> 01:24:22.58
They know what they're doing you know that there's all kinds of safe safeguards in place and if that team's properly trained like that

1100
01:24:22.58 --> 01:24:27.62
Should not happen it should not it's like you should be able the airplane should land safely all the horrible things

1101
01:24:27.62 --> 01:24:33.30
It could go wrong when you're flying in near plane and landing in a crazy airport like JFK or you know our LX

1102
01:24:33.30 --> 01:24:37.54
You're from the Hong Kong. Yeah, that's a doozy too. Yeah, so those kind of things that are crazy

1103
01:24:37.54 --> 01:24:41.62
So but there's a lot of things to go wrong, but if it's done properly and safe garbage in place

1104
01:24:41.94 --> 01:24:45.22
You're gonna you're gonna be fine. So so so but there's again

1105
01:24:45.38 --> 01:24:49.06
It doesn't mean that you know we expect flawless performance that no one's ever gonna make mistakes

1106
01:24:49.46 --> 01:24:52.50
I think if if a mistake isn't that bad it should be forgiven

1107
01:24:52.50 --> 01:24:59.54
But there isn't a there just isn't excuse of like well, it wasn't me somebody else on my team did it that's the opposite of extreme ownership

1108
01:24:59.54 --> 01:25:01.54
It doesn't work. That's not work

1109
01:25:02.42 --> 01:25:04.42
check

1110
01:25:04.42 --> 01:25:06.42
next

1111
01:25:06.42 --> 01:25:08.82
I this is relate well, I guess yeah, it's it is for life

1112
01:25:09.54 --> 01:25:11.70
I heard you say it is important to think

1113
01:25:12.66 --> 01:25:19.94
I heard Jocco say this too. How do you think meaning how do you talk to yourself? Do you ask yourself questions?

1114
01:25:19.94 --> 01:25:27.38
Do you think by talking to others? What do you believe is the most valuable method for becoming a clear thinker and communicator?

1115
01:25:29.78 --> 01:25:35.22
That's a deep question. I actually think it's pretty easy to answer it is easy answer I think I can answer it one word

1116
01:25:36.50 --> 01:25:37.46
go

1117
01:25:37.46 --> 01:25:39.46
Detach

1118
01:25:40.26 --> 01:25:42.26
That's that's that's how I think

1119
01:25:42.26 --> 01:25:47.62
Look you can't you got to step out you got to step back mentally you got to step back look at what's going on

1120
01:25:47.62 --> 01:25:52.26
And think and that's where you can think about it. That's where you can figure out what's going on

1121
01:25:52.98 --> 01:25:54.58
If you can do that you're there

1122
01:25:55.06 --> 01:25:58.26
If you can't do it you don't even know you're not doing it. That's a problem

1123
01:25:58.66 --> 01:26:03.22
When you're not detached you don't even know you're not detached you're in the storm and you don't even know it

1124
01:26:03.54 --> 01:26:09.62
That's a lot of stuff for that's exactly right, but I think you know for people it maybe don't fully understand what that means

1125
01:26:09.62 --> 01:26:15.06
Right this this idea of the tax which you've obviously talked a lot about on here and which is such a key thing for decision making

1126
01:26:15.94 --> 01:26:17.54
it's

1127
01:26:17.54 --> 01:26:22.90
The I think the key thing there is is to make sure that that you're not you're not clouded by

1128
01:26:23.46 --> 01:26:26.90
You know this emotional attachment to plans which we often talk about with our

1129
01:26:26.90 --> 01:26:30.98
Ladies and the seal teams like I'm emotionally invested in a plan that I came up with

1130
01:26:30.98 --> 01:26:34.26
I spent hours or days or weeks or months you know involved in

1131
01:26:34.98 --> 01:26:38.74
And I want that to succeed of course, but but is that you know

1132
01:26:38.74 --> 01:26:42.58
I got to have that realistic assessment and that's what the detachment really requires is that

1133
01:26:42.58 --> 01:26:49.14
You pull yourself not just physically away, you know out of the weeds or to say okay, let me think about this in the strategic picture

1134
01:26:49.14 --> 01:26:51.14
But you really you take away that

1135
01:26:51.54 --> 01:26:56.90
emotional investment that you have to maybe even whether it's a plan sometimes it's a team member as well

1136
01:26:56.90 --> 01:27:00.90
And if you have you know someone that you just have a close relationship with that you you know

1137
01:27:01.30 --> 01:27:06.02
Whether they're a relative of yours and you've had a long-standing relationship with and that maybe you've gotten too close to them

1138
01:27:06.02 --> 01:27:07.94
And you can't see that that you know

1139
01:27:07.94 --> 01:27:10.74
They become more important than the mission and they're dragging the rest of the team down

1140
01:27:10.74 --> 01:27:14.66
You're not making the that call either tighten them up or let them go. That's that's the right case

1141
01:27:14.66 --> 01:27:18.50
So I think what that really requires is you got to emotionally pull back

1142
01:27:18.50 --> 01:27:26.10
It's a it's a mental thing to really have a brutally honest assessment of the situation that's that's independent from any kind of

1143
01:27:27.38 --> 01:27:29.38
previous bias that you might have had

1144
01:27:30.26 --> 01:27:32.26
That's interesting there because

1145
01:27:32.26 --> 01:27:34.66
Even if you know like oh yeah, I'm gonna detach

1146
01:27:34.98 --> 01:27:38.26
Right, not that easy. Yeah, like you can go through the motions

1147
01:27:38.26 --> 01:27:45.06
You can't be like hey, I'm gonna detach from detach right now meanwhile you're just like I said clouded by the emotional part that you're like kind of one foot it

1148
01:27:45.38 --> 01:27:48.66
Emotionally so you're technically not detached so doesn't work

1149
01:27:49.30 --> 01:27:52.58
You know what else is a good way to think is to listen

1150
01:27:53.38 --> 01:27:57.22
Do listen what people are saying I've been thinking about how more how he said

1151
01:27:58.10 --> 01:28:00.10
if you listen

1152
01:28:00.10 --> 01:28:01.30
You know

1153
01:28:01.30 --> 01:28:05.38
Twice as much you know everything that you know and you know everything that the other guy knows

1154
01:28:05.38 --> 01:28:08.26
Yeah, that's a great that's a great thing

1155
01:28:08.42 --> 01:28:10.42
But if you're sitting in a you know conversation

1156
01:28:10.42 --> 01:28:15.86
I mean from a business perspective if you're in a meeting and and there's a conversation going on if you're in the conversation

1157
01:28:16.42 --> 01:28:19.14
You're talking you're adding your piece well

1158
01:28:19.70 --> 01:28:21.14
Then you're you're

1159
01:28:21.14 --> 01:28:26.02
Not detached you're in it, but if you sit back and you listen and you hear what's going on you can assemble

1160
01:28:26.66 --> 01:28:28.66
You know thoughts better

1161
01:28:29.14 --> 01:28:31.14
so

1162
01:28:31.14 --> 01:28:32.82
All right next

1163
01:28:32.82 --> 01:28:40.42
When can we expect any books to come out by either of you and what are they going to be like extreme ownership or way of the warrior kid?

1164
01:28:40.90 --> 01:28:46.90
So I also had a book called Displaning was Freedom. It's a Field Manual by the way sure you familiar with Field Manual

1165
01:28:46.90 --> 01:28:50.98
I go you claim to be familiar with Field Manual. That's favorite kind of manual. Yeah, okay

1166
01:28:52.90 --> 01:28:55.78
Way the warrior kid two is coming out in April

1167
01:28:56.98 --> 01:28:58.98
It's called Mark's Mission and

1168
01:28:58.98 --> 01:29:04.90
And we are in the process of writing latefabbing tell me about that. Yes, we are we're getting after a second book right now

1169
01:29:04.90 --> 01:29:06.90
It's a follow on book to extreme ownership and

1170
01:29:07.62 --> 01:29:12.02
I'm super excited about it's it's gonna be in the same format when we talk about combat

1171
01:29:12.58 --> 01:29:17.86
Combat lessons learn on the battlefield or in training and then a principle and then it's application the business world

1172
01:29:18.50 --> 01:29:24.82
And the same in the same format of extreme ownership and and what it really is is it's to answer all of the questions and

1173
01:29:24.82 --> 01:29:30.34
Difficult these people have from applying the principles we get these common questions all the time of like okay

1174
01:29:30.34 --> 01:29:35.86
I'm having this issue and okay, you said take ownership here, but but what does that really mean and or how do I apply?

1175
01:29:35.86 --> 01:29:37.86
Cover moved you know to my team

1176
01:29:38.18 --> 01:29:46.10
These it's gonna dive much deeper into that and it's it's gonna be also gonna be coming out fall of 2018. How do you feel about writing a sequel?

1177
01:29:47.86 --> 01:29:52.42
It's it's not a sequel. It's gonna be a standalone book on its own

1178
01:29:52.42 --> 01:29:56.18
It's gonna be good. Okay. I think it's nerve-racking

1179
01:29:57.30 --> 01:29:59.30
Because you know what have you ever seen the movie jaws?

1180
01:30:00.50 --> 01:30:04.66
Yes, yes, that's one of my favorite movies. Have you ever seen the movie jaws too?

1181
01:30:06.10 --> 01:30:11.06
Yes, we got issues with jaws too. We got issues. Yeah, and this is what I think

1182
01:30:11.86 --> 01:30:17.22
So I think again, I'll call it luck. Maybe not, but I call it luck

1183
01:30:17.94 --> 01:30:20.82
Luckily for us this book has sold really well

1184
01:30:20.82 --> 01:30:22.82
that

1185
01:30:23.54 --> 01:30:26.74
If we would have written a sequel a year

1186
01:30:27.46 --> 01:30:32.98
After this book came out it would have been jaws too to be honest with you, but luckily

1187
01:30:33.86 --> 01:30:39.70
During because now it's been two years since this came out so we've had and in by the way I've followed up year

1188
01:30:39.94 --> 01:30:44.34
If we were to release the book if the publishers going release another book release another book

1189
01:30:44.34 --> 01:30:46.98
You will pay you more money. That's what they do. They want you to release another book now

1190
01:30:46.98 --> 01:30:50.18
We got some hype from this book. We'll get another one out there and life and I will like well, no

1191
01:30:50.18 --> 01:30:52.18
not right now

1192
01:30:52.18 --> 01:30:54.18
stop and

1193
01:30:54.74 --> 01:30:59.22
We'll let time that we write another book. Well, I did write another book, but they're not the same right?

1194
01:30:59.78 --> 01:31:06.18
We don't we don't want to make jaws too. So we let time go and guess what we're doing all the time that we that we had passed

1195
01:31:06.82 --> 01:31:10.58
We weren't sitting around. No, we were working with more companies. We were working with more military units

1196
01:31:10.58 --> 01:31:14.98
We were working with police. We were working firefighters. We were having the master. We were learning more and more lessons

1197
01:31:14.98 --> 01:31:22.10
And we were getting feedback from this book and saying okay, I see some threads in it first. It was one little thread and it was another little thread

1198
01:31:22.10 --> 01:31:28.26
And now of a sudden all those threads come together and you get something you get you get a fabric

1199
01:31:29.30 --> 01:31:36.74
And that's what we waited for is let's get something that is a woven fabric that's gonna be strong like Kevlar

1200
01:31:36.74 --> 01:31:38.74
So the next book that we got coming out

1201
01:31:38.74 --> 01:31:45.30
I disagree with you that it's a standalone book. I don't think it's a standalone book. Are you gonna retract your statement?

1202
01:31:45.30 --> 01:31:46.66
I'm gonna give you chance

1203
01:31:46.66 --> 01:31:53.06
You should I do try my same because because it is I mean the new book I thought you were setting me up for a

1204
01:31:53.06 --> 01:31:54.66
An ambush there no

1205
01:31:54.66 --> 01:31:57.62
You're gonna not there no it's it

1206
01:31:57.62 --> 01:32:04.90
It I'm sure you could read the new book on your on its own, but you shouldn't you should read extreme ownership first

1207
01:32:04.90 --> 01:32:12.42
And then you read the new book and when you read the new book it's gonna again all those threads are gonna weave together and and

1208
01:32:13.94 --> 01:32:18.10
They're gonna be the perfect it's gonna be there gonna compliment each other. I'm a amazing way

1209
01:32:18.10 --> 01:32:22.50
I think that's in that in that method or and from that perspective absolutely

1210
01:32:22.50 --> 01:32:25.14
I think absolutely it is it is a sequel in that perspective

1211
01:32:25.54 --> 01:32:29.94
It will be written in a way that that you can read it as a standalone book for for sure

1212
01:32:30.34 --> 01:32:33.62
It will certainly reference you know the things that we taught about in extreme ownership and the

1213
01:32:33.62 --> 01:32:36.74
Foundational principles upon what's that that's a written

1214
01:32:37.22 --> 01:32:44.58
I think there are a few exceptions under your jaws analogy. Hello a lot actually. Yeah, I mean I can think that Indiana Jones the temple of doom

1215
01:32:44.58 --> 01:32:49.62
Yeah, Terminator yeah, Terminator two yeah, which may day, but it doesn't have a lot to do with how you said

1216
01:32:49.62 --> 01:32:53.94
Hey, let's wait a little bit. Yeah, so that's true. Yeah, so that's true. You can just a let's the whole story that you

1217
01:32:53.94 --> 01:32:58.42
Different right that's the difference because if you just oh we had a hit movie make another one right now

1218
01:32:58.42 --> 01:33:03.54
Yeah, that's a good title. Yeah, yeah, that's a good title. Yeah, jaws wasn't hit let's make another one

1219
01:33:03.54 --> 01:33:08.74
We'll call it jaws, too. Yeah, but if they would have waited like Terminator. They waited that what eight years or so

1220
01:33:09.22 --> 01:33:14.34
Then it's like okay a lot of things are updated a lot of new stuff. They figured out like you're saying the boom terminator

1221
01:33:14.34 --> 01:33:17.54
Dude just is good aliens aliens

1222
01:33:18.34 --> 01:33:23.06
First movie was that pretty quick afterwards the second movie aliens crush the person really

1223
01:33:23.06 --> 01:33:30.18
So I I I I'll to be totally honest. It's a gamble though. No, I actually I don't know because I'm

1224
01:33:30.90 --> 01:33:36.02
I'm halfway a little bit more than halfway done with my writing part right before we start editing each other

1225
01:33:36.50 --> 01:33:38.50
I think I think we might have a

1226
01:33:39.38 --> 01:33:44.02
Sequel that's better. I don't know I have a suspicion that the sequel's better possibly better

1227
01:33:44.90 --> 01:33:50.58
I think so too. It's been it's super fun to write you know as we're doing it and I think as you said our knowledge is so much more now

1228
01:33:50.58 --> 01:33:53.46
I mean we our knowledge of the business world was was

1229
01:33:54.26 --> 01:33:57.62
We've been working for a couple you know two or three years in the business world at that point

1230
01:33:58.02 --> 01:34:05.46
But but now we've got double more than double that and and the reach and expansion of of of what we've been doing since the release of extreme ownership is

1231
01:34:05.70 --> 01:34:08.74
It's it's a hundred X what we were doing you know previously so

1232
01:34:09.38 --> 01:34:12.58
That's just given us it's been an an massive education and and

1233
01:34:13.38 --> 01:34:16.74
Our knowledge of how to apply these things across the spectrum. Yeah is incredibly

1234
01:34:16.74 --> 01:34:23.94
Um, so much so much deeper than than it was previously and and I'm excited about yeah, it's gonna be good

1235
01:34:25.54 --> 01:34:28.50
Next question is how long is it take to prepare for a monster and

1236
01:34:29.62 --> 01:34:35.78
When we read this quite question earlier. I thought it was the person asking how long would take this individual me or all right

1237
01:34:35.78 --> 01:34:37.14
Well, whoever a

1238
01:34:37.54 --> 01:34:40.66
Person out in the world to get ready to go to the monster. Oh, yeah

1239
01:34:40.66 --> 01:34:46.10
And the answer to that is it doesn't take you any time you just I mean you should read extreme ownership for sure

1240
01:34:46.18 --> 01:34:48.18
But there's no like big physical

1241
01:34:48.90 --> 01:34:52.50
There's physical things that you do at the monster, but they're scaled that anybody can do them

1242
01:34:52.50 --> 01:34:57.06
So it's really you don't need to do any major preparation other than put your ego in check

1243
01:34:57.78 --> 01:34:59.78
I think biggest preparation you need is is to

1244
01:35:01.22 --> 01:35:05.70
Look at yourself in the mirror and and write down that that where your weakest and where you need to work

1245
01:35:05.70 --> 01:35:08.26
I mean that's what we want to talk out of don't care where you're doing great

1246
01:35:08.26 --> 01:35:12.74
We're not there to patch on the back. We want to care like where you can get better and everyone can get better

1247
01:35:13.06 --> 01:35:15.22
Certainly you can prove all the time and I think that's what you need to do

1248
01:35:15.22 --> 01:35:21.02
I thought this question is about how we prepare for the monster which is always about which is substantial always about life

1249
01:35:22.82 --> 01:35:24.82
That me on time

1250
01:35:25.46 --> 01:35:31.30
Yeah, it's it is it's on a work to prepare for the monster, but which is it's fun. Yeah, it's fun. It's great. We enjoy

1251
01:35:31.30 --> 01:35:39.22
But a random question in your experience have you had or do you see high injury rates in jujitsu

1252
01:35:40.34 --> 01:35:44.82
Want to start rolling again, but don't want to disrupt progress on the barbell

1253
01:35:45.70 --> 01:35:51.86
Oh, yeah, sure. What was that banter it's possible? I am being a weak suck

1254
01:35:52.90 --> 01:35:54.90
Although not probable

1255
01:35:54.90 --> 01:35:55.70
Yeah

1256
01:35:55.70 --> 01:35:57.06
Risk assessment what do you think?

1257
01:35:58.50 --> 01:36:00.50
Can you get injured in jujitsu? Yes. Yeah

1258
01:36:00.50 --> 01:36:02.50
Just like you can end your

1259
01:36:02.50 --> 01:36:06.18
Basketball you'll get injured playing basketball quicker than jujitsu. That's very interesting

1260
01:36:06.18 --> 01:36:14.26
In jujitsu. Yeah, first I will I will I will the key part about this question for me is you want to keep making progress on the barbell

1261
01:36:14.34 --> 01:36:15.94
Right, so you want to keep getting stronger

1262
01:36:16.34 --> 01:36:20.66
That's cool. I want you to be stronger, but if you're super strong you don't know how to fight

1263
01:36:21.14 --> 01:36:25.62
I got nothing for you. Yeah, that's a deeper thing to and keep this in mind though

1264
01:36:25.62 --> 01:36:30.58
And this goes for any if physical activity like if your goal physically is this thing and then you start going

1265
01:36:31.70 --> 01:36:36.10
Harden another direction it could very well take away from oh, it's a constant

1266
01:36:36.66 --> 01:36:41.22
You're you're not gonna reach your maximum potential as a weight lifter. Yeah, if you're doing jujitsu

1267
01:36:41.22 --> 01:36:43.22
Yeah, sure swimming or anything else

1268
01:36:43.22 --> 01:36:47.70
Whatever, yeah, you gotta find a balance, but I mean what's the most important? What's a more important skill to have?

1269
01:36:48.50 --> 01:36:49.86
be able to

1270
01:36:49.86 --> 01:36:54.10
snatch big weight or be able to defend yourself in a street fight

1271
01:36:54.10 --> 01:36:58.98
Yeah, hey the snatching big weights gonna help you defend yourself. Yeah, big time. We we we appreciate that were friends

1272
01:36:58.98 --> 01:37:00.98
Yeah, but

1273
01:37:00.98 --> 01:37:06.90
Prioritize yeah, now what's interesting is on a daily basis. I always work out

1274
01:37:07.54 --> 01:37:09.54
But I don't always do jujitsu because

1275
01:37:10.34 --> 01:37:15.38
You can't you need you need someone to train with you. You know what I mean? Like you need someone to do jujitsu with you can't do jujitsu by yourself

1276
01:37:15.86 --> 01:37:18.42
So sometimes you don't have anyone to train with look

1277
01:37:18.42 --> 01:37:21.30
I think for my perspective as as a white belt it's it's

1278
01:37:21.30 --> 01:37:24.42
I've trained enough you gotta be getting close to that blue belt

1279
01:37:26.02 --> 01:37:28.98
Well, I got a lot more work to do certain about

1280
01:37:28.98 --> 01:37:34.42
Right, I'm not up to him. You guys you guys have inspired me. I'm training training hard got to get a great place

1281
01:37:34.42 --> 01:37:37.38
I'm training down in Texas now John John Machado Austin's awesome

1282
01:37:37.38 --> 01:37:40.18
That's a good right yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1283
01:37:40.18 --> 01:37:40.82
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1284
01:37:40.82 --> 01:37:43.94
And they just the type of people that train in there. I mean it's it's it's

1285
01:37:44.66 --> 01:37:48.66
And that's that's what I like about that's that that's you know same thing in place. I train in New York

1286
01:37:48.66 --> 01:37:51.38
It's just that to me has I

1287
01:37:52.34 --> 01:37:57.62
Think of your constantly getting in general time like you're not training with the right people and you're not training in the in the right manner

1288
01:37:58.18 --> 01:38:01.62
Something that I learned years ago and when I was on the box and team the naval academy

1289
01:38:02.10 --> 01:38:04.42
Me and and my buddies, you know who were kind of scrubs

1290
01:38:04.42 --> 01:38:08.02
We didn't travel with the team. We just beat the piss out of each other every every day

1291
01:38:08.26 --> 01:38:14.02
And no one could breathe out of their nose and everyone had black eyes and then you watch the guy who was was the guys who were really skilled

1292
01:38:14.02 --> 01:38:19.38
They sparked but they were working on form. They were you know, they they weren't just knocking each other's heads off every

1293
01:38:19.78 --> 01:38:23.46
Punch every time you know every single day and I think that's it

1294
01:38:24.18 --> 01:38:28.90
That's where you have to it's great to train hard, but I think you need to train smart and I think you you need to the biggest thing

1295
01:38:28.90 --> 01:38:30.90
I'm guessing this person is probably

1296
01:38:30.90 --> 01:38:39.54
Has it trained that much so that they they they know Dave Birkin. I was rolling you know here victory last night and I was I was

1297
01:38:39.54 --> 01:38:45.22
I was telling Dave you know days he's made some progress. He's been training out in Virginia

1298
01:38:45.22 --> 01:38:48.10
I was like cool man you're doing good, but he's he gets so amped up

1299
01:38:48.42 --> 01:38:54.10
He can't the touch so he can't the touch because he's he's gets so amped up and it's I realized I used to just be in that

1300
01:38:54.10 --> 01:38:55.46
I've trained enough now

1301
01:38:55.46 --> 01:39:00.42
I still might be the white belt you but I've trained enough now to know that that I've got

1302
01:39:00.98 --> 01:39:03.22
I've got the throttle back because it's

1303
01:39:03.94 --> 01:39:07.70
You get so focused right I'm gonna focus on my one little white belt america

1304
01:39:07.70 --> 01:39:12.66
I'm trying to get you know our bar versus versus like no detach and thank for the sounds like

1305
01:39:12.66 --> 01:39:13.94
Four five getting that

1306
01:39:13.94 --> 01:39:18.26
Yeah, he's not too trained with him. Yeah, we did like yeah, yeah

1307
01:39:18.90 --> 01:39:21.86
So he it was funny is where we're rolling around. I mean it is is

1308
01:39:23.06 --> 01:39:25.70
And at one point I'm like laughing him because he's literally like

1309
01:39:26.98 --> 01:39:29.78
You know that kind of breathing like Dave in his

1310
01:39:31.30 --> 01:39:36.26
Like you know when you breathe when you feel here somebody breathing hard like that typically it's like when you're they're writing your ear

1311
01:39:36.26 --> 01:39:38.74
So it's it sounds way more intense

1312
01:39:38.74 --> 01:39:42.82
There would have been a time could have been also because I had a little little elbow pressure

1313
01:39:43.38 --> 01:39:49.86
Time period when you're in like kind of starting to jitsu and Dave Burke might be in this situation right now

1314
01:39:50.26 --> 01:39:53.62
It's it's the very early in jitsu where in your mind

1315
01:39:54.42 --> 01:40:00.10
You think like you know what like I'll be able to I think I'll be able to get like jockel right

1316
01:40:00.10 --> 01:40:05.86
Sure like I'll be like like he'd be a man if I I think they learn some little move and they're like

1317
01:40:05.86 --> 01:40:07.70
I throw this a jockel at the right time

1318
01:40:07.70 --> 01:40:10.18
I feel this at this black belt the right time. I'll be able to get him

1319
01:40:11.14 --> 01:40:13.62
You don't say yeah, you have that

1320
01:40:13.62 --> 01:40:16.02
Yeah, for sure I had that with teen one time

1321
01:40:16.90 --> 01:40:22.02
Yeah, I mean but what what I when you're amped up to that level though, you know, and yeah

1322
01:40:22.02 --> 01:40:26.42
You're thinking that like no one can tap me or and I don't think Dave's it is in that in that mode

1323
01:40:26.66 --> 01:40:28.18
He's he's learned enough

1324
01:40:28.18 --> 01:40:34.90
Maybe to be beyond that but it's it's when you're that amped up your chances of of getting injured or

1325
01:40:34.90 --> 01:40:40.98
Wayward just more significant and it's why you know if you see a brand new white belt come with I'm much rather roll with brown belt and

1326
01:40:41.30 --> 01:40:44.34
Perfect blue even though I know they're gonna you know they're gonna get the best of me

1327
01:40:44.98 --> 01:40:49.86
I have a much less chance of getting injured than just the death match with some white belt who's you know

1328
01:40:50.18 --> 01:40:56.34
Who doesn't even know you know anything and and just so I think you got to be smart about who you train with and that's what I love about

1329
01:40:56.34 --> 01:41:00.34
You know, John's up machin awesome with Todd White is guys there. They're they're they're super

1330
01:41:00.74 --> 01:41:05.06
You know they're very knowledgeable. They pass on stuff with their humble just like just like folks here

1331
01:41:05.54 --> 01:41:09.46
Victory I mean it it's and I think when you're training with the right people. They're like oh cool

1332
01:41:09.46 --> 01:41:15.86
You got you got me in an arm bar. You got more that choke was great show me how to do that and it's it's a but it's a humble learning environment

1333
01:41:15.86 --> 01:41:22.18
We're you know you're not there to injure people you're not there to get hurt and I think it's sure you're gonna get tweaks and and bumps and bruises

1334
01:41:22.18 --> 01:41:29.70
But I think there's you know if you're training smartly and training to learn then the chance of getting injured the probability is as much less

1335
01:41:29.94 --> 01:41:34.90
My boy Todd what Todd White he's like old school. Did you too guy and he

1336
01:41:35.54 --> 01:41:38.50
Me and him were on the circuit back in the

1337
01:41:38.50 --> 01:41:42.42
Comforters back in the day he was a L.A. Jean Jacques guy and

1338
01:41:43.38 --> 01:41:45.94
And anybody where he listens to podcast by the way. Yeah

1339
01:41:46.18 --> 01:41:49.22
L.A. That's only payments. Holy yeah, they were back in the day

1340
01:41:49.22 --> 01:41:54.10
All right, um, I'd be into that the jujitsu what even

1341
01:41:55.22 --> 01:42:00.02
Like I wouldn't want to paint the picture that like all white belts are gonna increase your chance of injury

1342
01:42:00.10 --> 01:42:07.22
It's it's kind of a specific type of person to roll it that will increase your chance of injury and that's like a guy who's strong

1343
01:42:08.58 --> 01:42:13.70
Mayor may not have like this eagle word you can't talk me and I'm gonna try to keep every single time for sure and

1344
01:42:14.34 --> 01:42:17.54
He has like an element of like

1345
01:42:17.54 --> 01:42:26.66
Legitimate strength and athleticism on top of it. So you got to put all those together like you go into a typical gym all you take all the white belts

1346
01:42:26.66 --> 01:42:28.66
You may not even have a guy like that

1347
01:42:28.66 --> 01:42:33.46
That's true. It's like the probability of a guy being like that is pretty low. Oh no

1348
01:42:33.46 --> 01:42:37.78
I did disagree there might be higher problem. I'm not pretty low depends on what

1349
01:42:38.34 --> 01:42:43.06
Do you change that though in my opinion what changes is the is the Bible structure like so

1350
01:42:43.54 --> 01:42:45.54
Someone's by oh you want to get tough with that guy over there

1351
01:42:45.54 --> 01:42:51.54
Well, let me I'm gonna impose some humility on you. It's called regulation it has yeah, which is yet another

1352
01:42:52.58 --> 01:42:58.10
Factor that kind of contributes to the the overall safety of it so and I'm not saying low like they're rare

1353
01:42:58.10 --> 01:43:01.78
Nothing like that when I'm saying if you take a just I don't know some random class a

1354
01:43:04.42 --> 01:43:07.06
New white belt spazzy strong

1355
01:43:07.46 --> 01:43:11.70
Maybe mayor may not be young with like a huge eagle maybe one guy

1356
01:43:11.70 --> 01:43:18.74
Me you won't get a class full of them. You know, so your day to day rolling is is pretty safe

1357
01:43:19.14 --> 01:43:24.02
You know, I mean yeah, you you do need to pick your training partners carefully. Yeah, for sure

1358
01:43:24.02 --> 01:43:27.30
But to to this guy though here's I mean it look

1359
01:43:28.66 --> 01:43:33.86
That could not go way back. I think I probably knew echo even before before you did jocelyn in our

1360
01:43:34.18 --> 01:43:37.30
Surface warfare days. I got good friend cake nuts who's a

1361
01:43:37.30 --> 01:43:42.82
Me to friend and others that we've a cake we we worked with in fact echo was you were he was a

1362
01:43:42.82 --> 01:43:46.10
Bouncer downtown before everyone knows because he talks about

1363
01:43:47.46 --> 01:43:49.46
He had to put it with all our shenanigans and

1364
01:43:50.02 --> 01:43:58.10
Back in the trouble but I remember coming in here and training it victory and echo was a blue belt and showing me and cake nuts like some moves and and and and and

1365
01:43:58.10 --> 01:44:01.70
And because I kind of had this mentality of the guy who asked this question of like you know

1366
01:44:01.70 --> 01:44:06.26
You might get injured and I was focused on other things and I trained your all the time

1367
01:44:06.26 --> 01:44:09.46
And a lot of times I'd be here to work out and I do stand up

1368
01:44:10.02 --> 01:44:16.10
And I would never I never trained you just to like I should have never stuck with it consistently didn't have the this one

1369
01:44:16.10 --> 01:44:18.10
To do that

1370
01:44:18.10 --> 01:44:21.94
For whatever reason I get pulled in different directions and you know here we are you know

1371
01:44:21.94 --> 01:44:25.54
Ten or twelve years later and echo's a brown belt. She knocking on the door of

1372
01:44:26.10 --> 01:44:29.54
I'm getting his black belt and I'm still a white belt. So who what doors are you knocking on?

1373
01:44:29.54 --> 01:44:31.94
I'm not knocking on this

1374
01:44:32.98 --> 01:44:34.58
I don't think about here silence out there

1375
01:44:34.58 --> 01:44:35.62
Yep

1376
01:44:35.62 --> 01:44:39.06
So don't be that guy. I think I would make the time to train

1377
01:44:39.38 --> 01:44:42.26
Get some yeah, for sure. All right

1378
01:44:42.82 --> 01:44:46.66
Losing a teammate both military and civilian civilian world happens

1379
01:44:47.22 --> 01:44:51.78
How do you assist and promote healing and growth within a team that has lost a pivotal member

1380
01:44:51.78 --> 01:45:03.70
What do you do when the emotional toll leaves your guys unfocused and is creating unacceptable risks?

1381
01:45:06.26 --> 01:45:12.50
Yeah, you know, I've talked about this this before and I think obviously in this can happen

1382
01:45:12.50 --> 01:45:16.42
This part of life is death and people are gonna die and you

1383
01:45:16.42 --> 01:45:21.86
Obviously we're all gonna deal they're all gonna face it sometime in a work environment

1384
01:45:22.42 --> 01:45:26.02
How do you deal with it one of the things that I always say is?

1385
01:45:27.30 --> 01:45:32.58
Get back to work right you you yes you're gonna more yes you're gonna have your more real services

1386
01:45:33.78 --> 01:45:38.50
And then you got to get back to work and I think if you let people

1387
01:45:39.22 --> 01:45:42.02
If you give them too much time off if you let them sit around

1388
01:45:42.66 --> 01:45:44.98
They're gonna get unfocused. They're gonna start thinking about

1389
01:45:44.98 --> 01:45:49.70
You know, they're gonna start thinking about things that are not good to think about because

1390
01:45:50.74 --> 01:45:52.82
We want to yes we want to mourn if we want to do

1391
01:45:53.38 --> 01:45:56.66
We want to remember but at the same time and I say this all time we don't want to do well

1392
01:45:57.30 --> 01:46:04.26
You don't want to dwell in the past you want to remember but don't dwell so I say get back to work

1393
01:46:04.98 --> 01:46:11.06
Going back to what we talked about earlier find out what your next mission is gonna be you have more of a reason to achieve your mission

1394
01:46:11.54 --> 01:46:13.54
because you lost someone that

1395
01:46:13.54 --> 01:46:17.86
You'll ask someone that can't and it can that can no longer

1396
01:46:18.50 --> 01:46:20.18
Carry on with their mission

1397
01:46:20.18 --> 01:46:22.18
So for them

1398
01:46:22.18 --> 01:46:27.46
Carry on with your mission go forward don't dwell in the past anybody that you lost that you cared about

1399
01:46:27.70 --> 01:46:33.94
What would they want you to do what they want you to sit around and and soak and look at the ground? No they don't want you to

1400
01:46:35.38 --> 01:46:37.38
Get your gear

1401
01:46:36.98 --> 01:46:40.42
Get your mind set straight and get back after it

1402
01:46:40.42 --> 01:46:45.78
So that's what I recommend I think that's that's exactly right and I think getting to work

1403
01:46:46.34 --> 01:46:51.06
The reason that's important is is if these people if that person died

1404
01:46:51.14 --> 01:46:56.26
You know and for the guys that we lost like if we just if we just gave up and walked away that means they died in vain

1405
01:46:56.58 --> 01:46:59.54
For nothing and and we're not gonna do that we're gonna

1406
01:46:59.54 --> 01:47:05.54
We're gonna double a triple quadruple down that mission to make sure that we win that their sacrifices weren't weren't in vain

1407
01:47:05.54 --> 01:47:08.18
And I think that's helping the team understand

1408
01:47:08.18 --> 01:47:14.26
What you're accomplishing and why they're doing what they're doing is is it incredibly important and we wrote about that

1409
01:47:14.26 --> 01:47:19.30
It's a partnership and talk about it all the time that understand and why and briefing the team and helping them understand

1410
01:47:19.30 --> 01:47:24.66
Why is it's critical but yeah, focus on accomplished in that mission is is what you got to do

1411
01:47:24.66 --> 01:47:29.30
I think the other thing to is you know do everything you can to take care of that that person and their family

1412
01:47:29.78 --> 01:47:34.10
Take care of their family and and help them out and you know that's an obligation that never goes away

1413
01:47:34.10 --> 01:47:39.86
That you're always gonna have and that's extremely important and something that's that's helped me through you know

1414
01:47:39.86 --> 01:47:46.26
Those difficult losses is by serving others and looking trying to look out for others and I got to do that even more than I do

1415
01:47:51.14 --> 01:47:53.14
You know another thing that can help out

1416
01:47:54.18 --> 01:47:59.86
In those dark times is a little bit of jiu-jitsu to be quite frank with you next questions about jiu-jitsu again

1417
01:48:01.30 --> 01:48:03.70
My BJJ coach knows it all

1418
01:48:03.70 --> 01:48:05.70
The problem is he's a know it all

1419
01:48:06.98 --> 01:48:12.58
Condescending insulting derogatory comments to students while classes in session

1420
01:48:13.54 --> 01:48:15.54
Option A stay

1421
01:48:16.02 --> 01:48:22.58
Option B go to a school down the road with less experienced but much more mature-minded teacher

1422
01:48:23.62 --> 01:48:26.50
What would jockel do what would life do what would echo do?

1423
01:48:26.50 --> 01:48:30.90
I would probably move okay

1424
01:48:33.14 --> 01:48:39.54
Fair enough straightforward depends how much depends how much less experienced though. Yeah, okay

1425
01:48:39.54 --> 01:48:46.10
But purple bow brown belt if I'm just beginning like belt whenever yeah move okay

1426
01:48:47.14 --> 01:48:53.54
Late fabric yeah, look it is as a white belt myself like I learned from there's amazing purple belts and brown belts out there

1427
01:48:53.54 --> 01:48:59.46
You know I learn a ton you know from you echo you always show me stuff and you you have a great knack for teaching

1428
01:48:59.70 --> 01:49:02.90
Which is good you know people some people just don't have that as as much and I think

1429
01:49:04.02 --> 01:49:08.74
Yeah, I think that's if you're at the white belt level. That's that's great. So I think that's

1430
01:49:11.06 --> 01:49:13.06
Jockel apparently disagrees

1431
01:49:13.06 --> 01:49:15.70
I go to very good teacher that is

1432
01:49:15.70 --> 01:49:18.82
Echoes you can see is you can see him swell up a little bit

1433
01:49:18.82 --> 01:49:20.82
It's that love it

1434
01:49:22.18 --> 01:49:24.18
You're the a life set it

1435
01:49:24.18 --> 01:49:26.18
Yeah, he's like a impartial

1436
01:49:27.70 --> 01:49:32.74
Listen that's because I've been you have taught me things. I imagine you have a taught jockel to exceed in that way

1437
01:49:33.14 --> 01:49:36.74
But and even if he would yeah, you should you should go for that

1438
01:49:37.22 --> 01:49:39.22
Maybe we should do that right now

1439
01:49:39.22 --> 01:49:41.22
Cumate

1440
01:49:41.22 --> 01:49:46.34
But look I yeah, I think you can learn from a lot of different people and and you'll mount one thing you just can't make sure as you can't make it

1441
01:49:46.34 --> 01:49:49.54
You make sure it's your ego getting the way and when someone's really coaching you said

1442
01:49:49.54 --> 01:49:51.30
Yeah, you need to do this you need to get better

1443
01:49:51.30 --> 01:49:55.14
And you just don't like the manner in which they're they're doing it public or whatever

1444
01:49:55.70 --> 01:49:59.06
You might need to put your ego in check and just say okay, I don't know everything of course

1445
01:49:59.06 --> 01:50:03.22
You know, let's learn if it's over the top then yeah absolutely you should go where you can learn

1446
01:50:04.26 --> 01:50:07.14
Best and the quality of the people around you that you're wrong with us

1447
01:50:07.14 --> 01:50:12.34
We talked about it earlier. I mean that that to me is everything and that's what I love about jitsu is that just the

1448
01:50:12.34 --> 01:50:19.30
You know such a diverse group of people when you get it a great jam you're trying to add it and just folks are working together and learning together and

1449
01:50:19.78 --> 01:50:23.94
You know they get the best of you and then there they're willing to show you about how they did that or some things

1450
01:50:23.94 --> 01:50:25.94
She's like about keep it a secret

1451
01:50:26.90 --> 01:50:32.34
My opinion on that is just a yeah, I agree with you guys, but at the same time I'll say this

1452
01:50:33.06 --> 01:50:38.82
One of the things you got to learn to do in life is you got to learn that you're not gonna get along with everyone and not everyone's personality

1453
01:50:38.82 --> 01:50:44.10
Is gonna mesh with yours that doesn't mean you throw away the baby with the bath water. Sure you see them saying

1454
01:50:44.10 --> 01:50:47.30
So there might be a guy that he's not a good teacher. He treats people like crap

1455
01:50:47.70 --> 01:50:53.78
But he's got really good information and he's you're learning a lot and you so you're gonna take as much knowledge as I can from that person

1456
01:50:54.10 --> 01:50:59.06
I'm not just gonna walk away because I don't like his attitude. You know what you're gonna have people that you work for

1457
01:50:59.06 --> 01:51:02.58
That have bad attitudes and you're gonna have people that work for you that have bad attitudes

1458
01:51:02.82 --> 01:51:06.90
You're gonna have to learn to deal with it. You're gonna have to learn how to get as much out of them as you can

1459
01:51:06.90 --> 01:51:11.46
Out of everybody as a leader everybody that you got there. There's people that aren't gonna be good at this

1460
01:51:11.46 --> 01:51:13.06
But they're good at that. Okay, well, let's let's

1461
01:51:13.78 --> 01:51:17.94
Capitalize and what they're good at so this guy very knowledgeable kind of a jerk

1462
01:51:18.10 --> 01:51:21.70
Let's capitalize on the fact that he's very knowledgeable put your ego in check and show up there

1463
01:51:22.26 --> 01:51:28.66
Take the knowledge from him. Yeah, and then years to come you pay him back pay him a visit. Yeah, I've

1464
01:51:29.86 --> 01:51:33.78
Dang it sure and I think but overall being true

1465
01:51:33.78 --> 01:51:40.26
But yeah, if yes, if you're getting the knowledge you're you emphasizing your life cruising

1466
01:51:40.58 --> 01:51:45.38
Non, I emphasize in my life getting after that so that's true for this therefore you're at that you're like

1467
01:51:45.38 --> 01:51:48.80
Oh, this guy doesn't cruise hard enough right right when we become people to get right

1468
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:54.42
Yeah, yeah, no, I dig it and but I think at the end of the day if how you said the guy

1469
01:51:54.42 --> 01:51:57.62
Yeah, he's not saying cool stuff or he's saying stuff that's not cool or whatever

1470
01:51:57.94 --> 01:52:01.70
But you're still getting the information then okay, you know and also just like

1471
01:52:01.70 --> 01:52:09.94
Um, with Jordan Peterson like it pays off in life to have thick skin like you're gonna be successful like that's one of the ingredients for

1472
01:52:09.94 --> 01:52:12.90
For success they dig it so if you're giving an information for sure

1473
01:52:13.38 --> 01:52:19.62
But a lot of times with the know it all situation which is the words he used oh I've been in that situation like a few times

1474
01:52:19.62 --> 01:52:25.62
So where it's like I see what you're doing there and you be in the guy who's kind of had some experience

1475
01:52:25.62 --> 01:52:29.70
I'm thinking like I don't the circumstances that you're talking about

1476
01:52:29.70 --> 01:52:33.78
That's not gonna work and I know that just from experience or whatever

1477
01:52:33.78 --> 01:52:37.86
But this guy's in all and no, no, I know you don't know kind of attitude or whatever and

1478
01:52:38.66 --> 01:52:44.42
If that's the way the whole teaching experiences and learning quote unquote learning experiences

1479
01:52:44.42 --> 01:52:46.34
I think no, I think more benefits would be

1480
01:52:46.98 --> 01:52:51.06
Gathered elsewhere. Yeah, it's interesting when when late for you're talking about yeah

1481
01:52:51.06 --> 01:52:53.86
You use your kid as a

1482
01:52:54.34 --> 01:52:59.54
Test for yourself to calm down and get more mature and detach and all that that's good

1483
01:52:59.54 --> 01:53:04.02
I basically do in that all the time like when I when I meet someone that that is rose me the wrong way

1484
01:53:04.02 --> 01:53:08.98
I always look at that like okay cool. I'm in a former relationship this person become their best friend and see if I can get through this

1485
01:53:08.98 --> 01:53:10.98
It's a big and happen. Yeah, so that's maybe what I do with that

1486
01:53:10.98 --> 01:53:13.46
It's a triple yeah, but while by the way

1487
01:53:13.46 --> 01:53:18.98
I'm taking all this knowledge from him so I can formulate it into goodness again if you get in the knowledge

1488
01:53:18.98 --> 01:53:23.30
Yeah, good man good, but as a white belt it's like come on bro you're gonna

1489
01:53:24.58 --> 01:53:26.82
You want to get the best teaching learning

1490
01:53:26.82 --> 01:53:32.58
Overall, you get to experience possible. That's where you know like as a new beginner white belt to whatever

1491
01:53:32.58 --> 01:53:36.82
I'm gonna come in and then just get insulted by and know it all the whatever like I don't know even though if I like you

1492
01:53:36.82 --> 01:53:42.18
Jitsu now yeah kind of things and you run there. It's not good for business. That's for sure. Yeah, so of course

1493
01:53:42.18 --> 01:53:45.46
Hey, you're jacco. I get it man. Life gets it, but

1494
01:53:46.18 --> 01:53:51.78
We're not all jacco when someone says like or is it know it all and I'm supposed to trust this person to teach me

1495
01:53:51.78 --> 01:53:57.54
Jiu Jitsu because you know for all the great reasons we take Jiu Jitsu and I'm trusting this person and

1496
01:53:57.54 --> 01:54:02.18
They're gonna be like how this guy explained I don't know man. I don't know be a question mark. That's cool

1497
01:54:02.50 --> 01:54:04.50
You go down the street and train

1498
01:54:05.06 --> 01:54:07.06
Yeah, I would rather get

1499
01:54:07.46 --> 01:54:12.90
99% of the knowledge from a good purple belt than five percent of the knowledge of a know it all guy

1500
01:54:14.74 --> 01:54:18.66
There's there's there's there's a clean argument for that next question

1501
01:54:19.86 --> 01:54:21.70
This is from

1502
01:54:21.70 --> 01:54:26.98
Vijay, normal Kumar. He's been he's been on in the game for a long time

1503
01:54:26.98 --> 01:54:30.50
Yeah, got a lot of a lot of lists. Do you know we've got a lot of listeners in India?

1504
01:54:30.50 --> 01:54:34.02
No, actually I talk to Vijay from time to time online check

1505
01:54:34.50 --> 01:54:36.50
so he says

1506
01:54:36.50 --> 01:54:38.10
You must have had

1507
01:54:38.10 --> 01:54:40.50
good days and awful ones

1508
01:54:40.50 --> 01:54:41.78
in the field

1509
01:54:41.78 --> 01:54:44.10
How did you manage to stay focused?

1510
01:54:44.90 --> 01:54:48.02
Despite the ups and downs? How did you win over the darkness?

1511
01:54:48.02 --> 01:54:53.86
Also, what was your workout like when you guys were engaged in the field and probably tired?

1512
01:54:54.18 --> 01:54:56.18
Two questions there

1513
01:54:56.66 --> 01:54:58.98
I think how you manage the ups and downs is is

1514
01:55:00.42 --> 01:55:02.66
You got to stay focused on what the goal is

1515
01:55:02.66 --> 01:55:04.66
You know, and I think we talk about that how

1516
01:55:05.38 --> 01:55:06.66
the recognition

1517
01:55:06.66 --> 01:55:11.70
You know when we came back from that deployment and you put that slide together about the battle of everybody

1518
01:55:11.70 --> 01:55:17.86
They kind of capture on this map, you know the the the areas that we'd taken back and even though I'd planned and led those

1519
01:55:17.86 --> 01:55:19.86
operations

1520
01:55:20.82 --> 01:55:24.90
You know so many of those operations. I've been intimately involved in the planning and leading those

1521
01:55:24.90 --> 01:55:28.50
Ops and then writing you know post-operational summaries and all the reports that we

1522
01:55:28.50 --> 01:55:32.10
We had and were involved in and so the battalion and brigade level meetings

1523
01:55:32.90 --> 01:55:34.74
You know for that that whole strategic plan

1524
01:55:35.30 --> 01:55:36.90
I didn't really have a fully grasp

1525
01:55:38.02 --> 01:55:42.58
Just I didn't put it all together in that way and when you when I saw that slide that you put together that showed

1526
01:55:42.90 --> 01:55:44.26
You know the red

1527
01:55:44.26 --> 01:55:48.90
Enemy held areas of her body and all of a sudden blue circles going in the the US bases

1528
01:55:49.54 --> 01:55:52.66
That were put in that we were often the lead element on the ground for

1529
01:55:54.02 --> 01:55:59.38
It put it all together for me in a way that that I had not seen before and that I recognized I had to do better job with my guys

1530
01:55:59.78 --> 01:56:04.10
I'm doing that too and I think that's something that for every later that's where that detachment comes in

1531
01:56:04.66 --> 01:56:08.74
To be able to think okay help me understand what this is all about

1532
01:56:09.14 --> 01:56:13.14
Through the dark times through the rough times so I can focus on what the strategic goal is

1533
01:56:13.14 --> 01:56:17.46
And and so I can help the team understand that as well and I think

1534
01:56:18.02 --> 01:56:22.10
That's that's something that you know if you step back from the details kind of think about it

1535
01:56:22.10 --> 01:56:26.34
So that you can understand it and then impart that team that's your team so they get an understanding

1536
01:56:26.34 --> 01:56:28.34
It's it enables them to slog through

1537
01:56:28.82 --> 01:56:33.30
When it's really difficult and it's dangerous or they've got some real challenges ahead

1538
01:56:33.70 --> 01:56:36.02
But they can say focus on that that that go

1539
01:56:36.90 --> 01:56:39.70
You also got to remember what it feels like to do the right thing

1540
01:56:39.70 --> 01:56:45.22
It for me like I know what it feels like to not do the right thing and I don't like that feeling

1541
01:56:46.74 --> 01:56:49.14
Later right it feels good right now

1542
01:56:49.14 --> 01:56:51.94
I'm not through the right thing because you're like cool back and she does

1543
01:56:52.50 --> 01:56:55.46
And I'm gonna get some right you know what that feels good right there

1544
01:56:55.46 --> 01:56:58.50
You know what it feels like later you know you went off the path and that's not good

1545
01:56:59.06 --> 01:57:03.06
So I just always think okay, well, I'm gonna suck it up now

1546
01:57:03.46 --> 01:57:06.42
Take the take the problem now take the hard path now because I know later

1547
01:57:06.42 --> 01:57:08.34
It's gonna pay off. I'm gonna feel better in the long run

1548
01:57:08.34 --> 01:57:12.98
Pay now pay later pay now our pay later. Let's stop with me when you said it. It's good. Yeah, yeah

1549
01:57:13.70 --> 01:57:16.98
I like when you pay now and pay later sometimes

1550
01:57:18.58 --> 01:57:23.22
Sometimes pay the man now and then pay them in later and then hey ask about workouts too

1551
01:57:24.02 --> 01:57:28.98
While we're in the field and and this is a good one because you know like firefighters right firefighters are on duty for 24 hours

1552
01:57:28.98 --> 01:57:31.38
So that means they're gonna get a workout in at some sometimes

1553
01:57:31.38 --> 01:57:38.82
If you're more than that, but there's a new 24 hours on on duty where they're at the station waiting for a call are you gonna do

1554
01:57:40.42 --> 01:57:41.70
Oh

1555
01:57:41.70 --> 01:57:47.14
Let's say one of the workouts from this man goes freedom field man. Or are you gonna do the three sets of

1556
01:57:47.70 --> 01:57:50.42
20 reps squats with 20 minute rest in between?

1557
01:57:50.42 --> 01:57:56.74
I think they call those little make are you gonna do that if you if you're if if within like 15 minutes

1558
01:57:56.74 --> 01:58:00.50
You might be called on to carry a kid down a ladder

1559
01:58:00.50 --> 01:58:05.78
Don't do that workout then because you won't be ready and that's kind of the attitude in Ramadi

1560
01:58:06.34 --> 01:58:11.38
It was like yeah, we we trained hard certainly and we know we talked about that on on podcast 65

1561
01:58:11.38 --> 01:58:17.46
The things they carried and and how we had to be we had to train hard, but you had to always hold a little back

1562
01:58:17.46 --> 01:58:22.82
Because you never knew when you're gonna get the call and you certainly after a big blow-out squat workout like that

1563
01:58:22.82 --> 01:58:26.58
I mean you you weren't gonna be able to run to the streets and run upstairs and drag your

1564
01:58:26.58 --> 01:58:33.38
250 pound buddy with 60 pounds a gear on you know for 50 yards across the open street while shooting with the other hand

1565
01:58:33.38 --> 01:58:39.38
So I mean those are the kind of things where you got to be ready for that and you could you had to leave a little reserve in the tank

1566
01:58:40.26 --> 01:58:42.26
Just in case

1567
01:58:42.26 --> 01:58:46.90
Because we got often well, we don't have an opportunity. Oh, we do have an opportunity. I get ready. Oh, yes, you do

1568
01:58:48.10 --> 01:58:51.06
Right on yeah, so leave a little in the tank. That's a good way of putting it

1569
01:58:52.02 --> 01:58:54.02
Okay, here's a good one

1570
01:58:54.02 --> 01:59:02.32
Question this is for both of you did either of you ever get into serious trouble as a teen before dream joining the military or were you always

1571
01:59:02.52 --> 01:59:04.52
exceptionally disciplined from a young age

1572
01:59:06.54 --> 01:59:07.86
This rave bab at

1573
01:59:07.86 --> 01:59:09.30
exceptionally

1574
01:59:09.30 --> 01:59:12.10
There reason I'm laughing if my if my parents

1575
01:59:13.06 --> 01:59:17.82
Or listening to this and they're probably laughing hysterically right now, so as as or mine this is yeah

1576
01:59:17.82 --> 01:59:22.50
I got an all kinds of trouble all kinds of trouble all the time. I was a total while man

1577
01:59:22.50 --> 01:59:26.18
I think you should you're brother with an arrow in the leg or something

1578
01:59:26.18 --> 01:59:27.94
I know he stabbed himself

1579
01:59:27.94 --> 01:59:28.94
Okay

1580
01:59:28.94 --> 01:59:31.30
He stabbed me so we should each other with beady guns

1581
01:59:31.30 --> 01:59:34.30
Going to the list all the time that was and we threw spears in each other

1582
01:59:34.30 --> 01:59:38.30
Yeah, you know in high school. I drove around with an old beat up pickup truck

1583
01:59:38.30 --> 01:59:44.98
And I heard it from my my uncle who'd inherited from my grandfather and smash road signs and just knucklehead stuff and

1584
01:59:45.62 --> 01:59:48.26
Yeah, I was a complete idiot and

1585
01:59:48.26 --> 01:59:52.82
But you know in the military helps score me way certainly and it was

1586
01:59:53.22 --> 02:00:00.06
I'm lucky that I didn't do something that caused me to have you know lifelong injury or death or or damage

1587
02:00:00.06 --> 02:00:04.28
You know, I think or do something you get a bunch of trouble for for sure that would have changed your jacket

1588
02:00:04.28 --> 02:00:09.94
You prevented me from going to the Naval camp prevent me from going to the military and and and would have that would have redirected my whole life

1589
02:00:09.94 --> 02:00:11.94
So I think

1590
02:00:11.94 --> 02:00:16.06
You know if you're in that stage and you're you're a wild teen

1591
02:00:16.06 --> 02:00:19.18
You need to think clearly about the long-term consequences

1592
02:00:19.82 --> 02:00:25.34
Because you definitely can pay the man now and pay later in that situation for sure one of the things that we do is as

1593
02:00:25.74 --> 02:00:32.86
Young boys and speaking from a boy perspective because I'm not a girl and when I was growing up and with the way I look back on it now

1594
02:00:32.86 --> 02:00:37.22
a lot of the stuff that we did dumb stuff that we did as teenagers was

1595
02:00:37.54 --> 02:00:45.10
We were testing each other and we were trying to prove ourselves back on on top watch me do this like on it's almost it's almost like if you go

1596
02:00:45.10 --> 02:00:47.10
Instinctually as a tribe member

1597
02:00:47.50 --> 02:00:51.02
You're proving that you're willing to sacrifice you're willing to take risk and sacrifice

1598
02:00:51.02 --> 02:00:55.02
That's what you're proving to your peers like I'm gonna like what you just said pick up truck

1599
02:00:55.26 --> 02:00:59.52
I'm gonna drive down the road and I'm gonna I'm gonna run over this sign. Well, okay

1600
02:00:59.52 --> 02:01:05.58
It's funny, but you're also proving to your friends that you don't really care and you'll take risk and you'll do things for the tribe

1601
02:01:05.58 --> 02:01:09.18
That's kind of what you're proving so I think again

1602
02:01:09.18 --> 02:01:13.10
I don't want to sound like going back to the same broken record

1603
02:01:13.10 --> 02:01:17.66
But if you want to get your kid or if you're a kid and you want to prove yourself guess what you can do

1604
02:01:17.66 --> 02:01:20.10
You can go take your jitsu you can learn how to fight for real

1605
02:01:20.10 --> 02:01:24.30
You can learn how to defend yourself you can learn how to take care of your tribe take care of yourself take care of your family

1606
02:01:24.30 --> 02:01:30.58
And you can do you can learn how to beat up other people which is an important thing. I wish I would have known it

1607
02:01:31.26 --> 02:01:35.86
When you know jitsu you have a less of a chance of getting into a fight because the way you act is different

1608
02:01:35.86 --> 02:01:42.82
You don't act like a jackass because you realize that you might get stabbed and so you act respectful to people

1609
02:01:42.82 --> 02:01:46.86
And people can tell that and you're respectful back to you. So yeah, it's just another thing

1610
02:01:46.86 --> 02:01:52.82
I think helps out a lot with kids because I think boys are always trying to prove themselves to each other and to themselves

1611
02:01:52.82 --> 02:01:58.14
That you're tough and that you're brave. I'm trying to prove that you know how many that's just let's just survey

1612
02:01:59.54 --> 02:02:02.82
How many times did you jump off the roof of you know buildings?

1613
02:02:04.38 --> 02:02:06.58
A lot. Yeah, it's like why are you doing that?

1614
02:02:06.58 --> 02:02:11.38
We actually used to go when I was we'd go fishing on the oil rigs off the coast go deep sea fish

1615
02:02:11.38 --> 02:02:13.38
And you might run 40 or 50 miles off and

1616
02:02:14.34 --> 02:02:18.94
You're not supposed to get on the rigs. There's all these signs to stop but we totally get up on the rig and just jump off

1617
02:02:18.94 --> 02:02:20.94
60 feet off the top of the rig

1618
02:02:20.94 --> 02:02:22.58
Which was awesome it hurts a little bit

1619
02:02:22.58 --> 02:02:27.70
But it was good times, but we do things to prove that we're tough

1620
02:02:27.70 --> 02:02:34.02
Like I did a lot of dumb things when I was a kid and most of them were to prove to myself and to my friends

1621
02:02:34.02 --> 02:02:39.50
That I was tough and that I was committed and then I would take risks which are all that was crazier than that

1622
02:02:39.50 --> 02:02:43.30
Which are all positive qualities right that you want like we're in the teams

1623
02:02:43.46 --> 02:02:50.74
We're kind of kind of team it you want you want a guy that's aggressive you want a guy that will take risks if he needs to you want a guy that's committed

1624
02:02:51.30 --> 02:02:55.06
That's what you want so in these little weird tribes that we have as teenagers

1625
02:02:55.06 --> 02:02:56.96
That's what we have and when are you gonna do the proof?

1626
02:02:56.96 --> 02:03:02.22
Let's go get a fight with somebody. Let's go beat someone up. You know those all those dumb things that you do so be smart

1627
02:03:02.78 --> 02:03:04.98
Be smart neither one of us

1628
02:03:05.22 --> 02:03:07.22
We're model children to say

1629
02:03:07.22 --> 02:03:12.14
To say the least all right, late next one. Late first off. Thanks for picking up the spear

1630
02:03:12.14 --> 02:03:15.58
I'm interested to hear more about the mousha-hodeen in Ramadi

1631
02:03:15.74 --> 02:03:24.24
How did they stack up against US forces was it like an NFL team playing against the high school team or did they have tactics training and discipline equal to our own

1632
02:03:26.58 --> 02:03:28.62
Well first of all, I appreciate the thanks

1633
02:03:28.62 --> 02:03:31.54
But it was an honor for me to carry the spear and as we said

1634
02:03:31.54 --> 02:03:34.70
We'd go back there in a heartbeat certainly. This is a great question

1635
02:03:34.70 --> 02:03:37.90
It's a great question. I think it really gets to the heart of

1636
02:03:38.30 --> 02:03:42.46
What we talk about all the time is the greatest quality in a leader in that is humility

1637
02:03:43.18 --> 02:03:49.22
And when we look at the mousha-hodeen are the mousha as we call them right the enemy fighters who control Ramadi

1638
02:03:49.22 --> 02:03:52.80
There were several thousand of them by by US intelligence reports

1639
02:03:53.46 --> 02:04:00.86
Estimates one who controlled two thirds of the geographic area the city when we first arrived in the spring of 2006 with Tasking and Bruser when Jalkan

1640
02:04:00.86 --> 02:04:06.08
I were there and you know, we were showing up our our seals are some of the best shooters in the world

1641
02:04:06.08 --> 02:04:08.08
There's some of the best

1642
02:04:08.08 --> 02:04:10.08
Combat troops in the world. We have

1643
02:04:10.58 --> 02:04:15.54
Highly-screened group of guys who've been through all the seal training pipeline that's a year and a half long

1644
02:04:15.54 --> 02:04:20.22
Probably at a minimum and then we've worked together for almost a year as a as a seal

1645
02:04:20.22 --> 02:04:23.10
Poutine we've got guys with extraordinary physical fitness

1646
02:04:23.50 --> 02:04:27.62
We go to these awesome shooting schools. We train together. We have we have the best

1647
02:04:27.62 --> 02:04:32.14
Budget and gear you know that that all the giant special operations

1648
02:04:32.70 --> 02:04:37.24
You know budget can buy the best training and equipment and so when we get over there

1649
02:04:37.24 --> 02:04:45.34
We're we're ready to go and and pound for pound if you take you know a seal operator from Charlotte but soon versus one of the moush fighters that were going up against

1650
02:04:46.18 --> 02:04:55.22
That seal operator can do hundreds of push-ups. He can do hundreds of pull-ups. That's NFL versus great school exactly and that you know the moush fighter

1651
02:04:55.22 --> 02:04:57.22
He

1652
02:04:57.22 --> 02:05:05.36
He has versus no training. He he probably can't do 10 push-ups. He's he has none of the gear and awesome gear that we have and

1653
02:05:06.42 --> 02:05:09.30
And it's so it's pound for pound. It's not even comparable and yet

1654
02:05:10.42 --> 02:05:17.34
To think about this from from the reality perspective right in my put in Charter but then we had 16 seals and five of those guys were brand new

1655
02:05:17.96 --> 02:05:20.74
Straight out of training never been never been a combat before

1656
02:05:20.74 --> 02:05:30.36
Never been never deployed Iraq five of us and we're going up against the enemy that has had three years at that time three straight years of

1657
02:05:30.82 --> 02:05:36.06
Nonstop real world combat experience and so the the experience level is not even comparable

1658
02:05:36.34 --> 02:05:38.70
When we're going up against these guys they know the city

1659
02:05:39.10 --> 02:05:45.26
They I mean and they're able to use our weaknesses against this whereas we got to carry all the heavy weight and you know the body arm

1660
02:05:45.26 --> 02:05:50.54
The helmets and and we're not a climate ties to 115 or hundred you know 20 degree high

1661
02:05:51.18 --> 02:05:56.74
During the during the day and the heat of the summertime they are and they live there and they don't have to carry water on them

1662
02:05:56.74 --> 02:05:59.22
They don't have to carry body armor no, but they they

1663
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:07.96
They can just throw a backpack with seven RPG rockets and a rocket tube and roll out with their flip flops and knock off a detest tracksuit which is what they generally were and

1664
02:06:09.18 --> 02:06:14.14
You know or they're built fed you know rushing machine guns that they use they weren't near as good as the ones we had

1665
02:06:14.14 --> 02:06:21.26
But they were they were deadly and they could use them and they could shoot and so you could never ever ever take those guys for granted

1666
02:06:21.26 --> 02:06:27.90
And I think that's the if they would always be looking to probe weaknesses and they weren't there to fight us head to head

1667
02:06:28.30 --> 02:06:32.94
They would try to take advantage of our weaknesses. They were very good analyzing a situation

1668
02:06:33.58 --> 02:06:39.14
Looking at a weakness and taking advantage of that weakness of probing form and and if you ever took them for granted

1669
02:06:39.14 --> 02:06:44.36
I mean they were they were gonna they were you're setting yourself they might hit you hard anyway and you might get got it lose guys

1670
02:06:45.22 --> 02:06:49.32
Even if you were prepared but if you weren't prepared and you started taking for that infigranded

1671
02:06:49.32 --> 02:06:53.70
You started getting complacent and and not respecting them as an enemy

1672
02:06:54.70 --> 02:07:00.16
Then then you were gonna fail and they kind of I mean for lack of better really they cheat too

1673
02:07:00.16 --> 02:07:01.36
That's the thing right?

1674
02:07:01.36 --> 02:07:07.78
So you guys have rules of engaged with all this stuff and they just straight up and then and what's I would say even more important

1675
02:07:07.78 --> 02:07:09.78
That is

1676
02:07:09.78 --> 02:07:12.78
They don't have value for for human life

1677
02:07:12.78 --> 02:07:17.98
They don't value their lives. They're literally suicide bombers and so that you know

1678
02:07:17.98 --> 02:07:20.74
They could lose five they even want to die

1679
02:07:21.06 --> 02:07:25.94
Yeah, they wanted they want to achieve martyrdom in many cases and so

1680
02:07:26.74 --> 02:07:34.32
You know them dying is is not a huge impact and then obviously for for Americans and American soldiers and our friends

1681
02:07:34.32 --> 02:07:44.28
It's it's it's epic and and crushing loss of life every single time and so that is the the biggest difference is that

1682
02:07:44.92 --> 02:07:46.92
We have to

1683
02:07:46.92 --> 02:07:52.56
It's like being and it's like you know, he says it this way says he says it's an FL versus high school team, right?

1684
02:07:53.04 --> 02:07:55.28
Well the the if the NFL

1685
02:07:56.60 --> 02:07:59.44
Should destroy that team right completely destroy it

1686
02:07:59.44 --> 02:08:06.48
But if the high school team scores a single point the kick of field goal. Yeah, they get lucky and kick of field goal

1687
02:08:06.48 --> 02:08:11.44
That's it that's a win and it that's that's crutch that's crushing and that's kind of what it's like

1688
02:08:11.92 --> 02:08:14.56
They're not gonna win if they're not gonna win the game

1689
02:08:15.52 --> 02:08:19.20
But even when they put a score on the board man, it's crushing and

1690
02:08:19.80 --> 02:08:23.24
One thing that you know as I think about it too that the what was unique about that

1691
02:08:23.24 --> 02:08:28.92
Tasking and bruiser diploma to remind in 2006 was you know I'd put three times to Iraq had quite a you know

1692
02:08:28.92 --> 02:08:33.52
Jockel made mobile performance to Iraq. We a lot of you know we had a handful guys have been there multiple times

1693
02:08:33.52 --> 02:08:38.72
The guys who went later afghanistan and and and and elsewhere around the world and so all significant

1694
02:08:38.72 --> 02:08:43.40
Common operations, but what was unique about that was we were we were going on foot

1695
02:08:43.40 --> 02:08:47.92
Do you want to drive because you need to blown up with these you know horrific IDs are gonna destroy your vehicles

1696
02:08:47.92 --> 02:08:52.90
So we park our vehicles we had to carry everything on our backs and and and walk in

1697
02:08:52.90 --> 02:09:01.42
Into deep deep and enemy territory in place where we knew that it was very unlikely that that tanks could even get to us to help us out in some cases

1698
02:09:02.50 --> 02:09:05.82
And if they did if they were gonna try to come in they might very well get blown up and kill

1699
02:09:06.10 --> 02:09:08.62
So what was interesting about that is you know we might have

1700
02:09:09.46 --> 02:09:10.86
8 or 10 or you know

1701
02:09:10.86 --> 02:09:14.54
Seals sometimes it may be it was 20 seals, but but that's a fairly small group

1702
02:09:14.54 --> 02:09:18.18
You know we've had some Iraqi soldiers well this but we didn't count them when it came to

1703
02:09:18.18 --> 02:09:23.54
They didn't count when it came to a who's gonna actually be able to defend this position, but I had to have the expectation

1704
02:09:24.10 --> 02:09:27.14
That that we might very well have

1705
02:09:27.90 --> 02:09:29.90
50 60 enemy fighters

1706
02:09:29.90 --> 02:09:36.54
Surrounding our position attack us and and they could easily overrun us and what was unique about that to point was we didn't have dedicated air support

1707
02:09:36.54 --> 02:09:42.30
We didn't have a dedicated quick reaction force that was gonna come out and and help us that only was supporting us

1708
02:09:43.22 --> 02:09:44.66
Unlike you know some other

1709
02:09:44.66 --> 02:09:51.62
Seal common operations that that have happened elsewhere and and it was or on other diplomas that I was on and we were on our own

1710
02:09:51.62 --> 02:09:56.74
We had to plan for that and and you had to recognize it they could add they would absolutely bring it and

1711
02:09:56.74 --> 02:10:03.58
They would try to kill you overrun your position and kill everybody capture someone and that was a real possibility that we had to be

1712
02:10:03.98 --> 02:10:07.78
We had to recognize could happen at any time and we had to be ready for well

1713
02:10:07.78 --> 02:10:14.42
Just to just to state the statement of fact on top of what you're saying the the enemy did the enemy did overrun

1714
02:10:14.82 --> 02:10:16.34
Friendly positions

1715
02:10:16.34 --> 02:10:20.10
Multiple times while we're there and kill dozens of people and some of those

1716
02:10:20.34 --> 02:10:27.78
You know some of those heavily fortified ECPs would get completely overrun attacked overrun vehicle born ID so it

1717
02:10:27.78 --> 02:10:29.94
Yeah, it wasn't like this could happen

1718
02:10:30.38 --> 02:10:33.42
This is actually happening while while we were there

1719
02:10:33.42 --> 02:10:40.42
Friendly positions got overrun by the enemy and so yeah, it was not just it could happen

1720
02:10:40.42 --> 02:10:45.50
But it is happening and it's a it could happen to us tonight tomorrow night whenever

1721
02:10:45.50 --> 02:10:49.42
Yeah, they were good they used cover move. I mean they laid down fire to pour each other

1722
02:10:49.42 --> 02:10:50.42
They they they

1723
02:10:50.42 --> 02:10:55.10
They buy together plans to get the combined arms they combined arms, you know, they'd come in with the

1724
02:10:56.34 --> 02:11:01.18
The machine gun fire and then the Rpg fire and the mortifier and and then all the sun there'd be a VB ID

1725
02:11:01.18 --> 02:11:03.18
That's that's what they do

1726
02:11:03.18 --> 02:11:07.74
And there were different levels within there as well. I mean sometimes you get shot at and it was kind of a spray and spray someone

1727
02:11:07.74 --> 02:11:12.92
Dump in an AK in your direction and then other times you'd have multiple belt fed machine guns hitting you that were you know

1728
02:11:12.92 --> 02:11:17.94
Coming through a little you know three or three by four foot window from a hundred yards away

1729
02:11:18.78 --> 02:11:22.76
And they're coming in she's over your head and you're looking at you like man these guys know what they're doing

1730
02:11:23.42 --> 02:11:29.10
They so you could tell when you know the the guys who've been there for a while maybe come from elsewhere

1731
02:11:29.10 --> 02:11:33.92
They brought it and you could never take them for granted and also luckily for us even though we might

1732
02:11:33.92 --> 02:11:39.62
I'd had a dedicated QRF we had the best damn QRF in the world, which was absolutely the one one AD and

1733
02:11:40.58 --> 02:11:46.26
They were awesome and never failed to come and save the asses of to you

1734
02:11:46.26 --> 02:11:50.26
They brave those roads over and over and over and over again jumping in their tanks

1735
02:11:50.26 --> 02:11:54.46
Taken such tremendous risk or driving in home these down these horribly dangerous road

1736
02:11:54.46 --> 02:11:59.58
We didn't want to drive to come help us out and they did all the time. They were awesome and we couldn't done any of our

1737
02:11:59.58 --> 02:12:02.06
Apprentices without them next question

1738
02:12:03.22 --> 02:12:06.26
And this is actually good question. It's it's how did the

1739
02:12:07.78 --> 02:12:14.30
Naval Academy prepare you to lead and actually a lot of listeners at the Naval Academy and a lot of listeners at West Point

1740
02:12:15.02 --> 02:12:19.26
I hear from them and actually I got sent that's true the helmet I got sent somebody sent me a

1741
02:12:19.70 --> 02:12:23.58
Hand painted Navy football helmet pretty awesome with a worship on it

1742
02:12:23.58 --> 02:12:27.14
Yeah, I'll show it to you this afternoon. So awesome. Thanks for sending me that by the way

1743
02:12:27.66 --> 02:12:29.66
It's awesome

1744
02:12:29.66 --> 02:12:33.06
So like like I said a lot of listeners we've had Brian stand on you know

1745
02:12:33.06 --> 02:12:35.94
He talked about his experiences there and a lot of leadership he got

1746
02:12:36.30 --> 02:12:41.10
From the Naval Academy was actually from playing football when you listened to him these playing football the Naval Academy

1747
02:12:41.10 --> 02:12:43.74
Which was was a challenge for him

1748
02:12:44.10 --> 02:12:48.74
But he learned a lot of leadership lessons there how did the naval Academy prepare you to lead?

1749
02:12:48.74 --> 02:12:56.26
Well first I love my spirit of the Naval Academy and for me that was all about the people that I

1750
02:12:56.26 --> 02:13:00.86
I served with you know in the folks that I met and and the things that we went through together

1751
02:13:00.86 --> 02:13:05.26
I got in a lot of trouble in the Naval Academy. I struggled my grades something we taught about previously

1752
02:13:05.26 --> 02:13:12.30
I got I had a big conduct record because I still did some of those knucklehead teenage things and and rebelled against authority

1753
02:13:12.82 --> 02:13:14.82
But frankly

1754
02:13:14.82 --> 02:13:20.22
Look there's great people there you know, there's great people on the staff. I've got a very close friend there's a batina officer now

1755
02:13:20.22 --> 02:13:21.62
And it's awesome to have

1756
02:13:21.62 --> 02:13:28.90
Good people there that are passing lessons on to you know to those young midshipmen as as a graduating and for every Academy or artis union

1757
02:13:28.90 --> 02:13:30.10
You know

1758
02:13:30.10 --> 02:13:34.58
For that matter I saw you know because you have a such a wide swath of officers from all different

1759
02:13:35.70 --> 02:13:37.70
You know from all different

1760
02:13:37.70 --> 02:13:45.94
You know Navy Marine Corps mean every every kind of different branch of within those services as well and and also you have a

1761
02:13:45.94 --> 02:13:48.42
A midshipman leadership hierarchy

1762
02:13:48.42 --> 02:13:54.18
You've got someone who because they made good grades or had a good kind of a ever got got promoted into this kind of make believe

1763
02:13:54.18 --> 02:14:00.58
Did you ever there? Yeah, a little bit of you know a little bit of anger about that one right there just because they got good grades

1764
02:14:00.58 --> 02:14:02.82
You know God they really think God

1765
02:14:02.82 --> 02:14:09.94
Correctors there can be a charge me listen there there are some resentful this is new lay if I just met a new lay for resentful lay

1766
02:14:09.94 --> 02:14:11.94
I'm actually not at all resentful I

1767
02:14:11.94 --> 02:14:12.98
I

1768
02:14:12.98 --> 02:14:17.54
Can tell you I had some I had some good friends who were in those positions and it was great for them, you know good for them

1769
02:14:18.10 --> 02:14:24.10
It's kind of it's just it's funny looking back now because it's completely meaningless right when you're do you have a regimental commander there?

1770
02:14:24.34 --> 02:14:29.80
Yeah, there's that guy in charge of all the students. Yeah, there's there's you know there's a regiment brigade

1771
02:14:29.80 --> 02:14:37.72
Battalion at OSS they have it too that when I was an OSS. I was the man. I was called you the regiment always red you calm

1772
02:14:38.28 --> 02:14:40.68
So no one is a little sensitive this

1773
02:14:40.68 --> 02:14:42.44
There's a little said red calm

1774
02:14:42.44 --> 02:14:48.36
Yeah, they also called the five bar because you the only person with five bars on your little uniform

1775
02:14:48.36 --> 02:14:52.36
Did they did they call you captain big time? No, they cover all president day

1776
02:14:52.76 --> 02:14:58.20
I was a president of my class too. Why did good time for OSS? So now now we see the sense of divity there

1777
02:14:58.20 --> 02:15:06.04
Yeah, listen, I you know great we maybe you should have studied or that I mean some kids now or I hear from I get I get correspondence from people with the Naval Academy

1778
02:15:06.04 --> 02:15:11.16
And like I can see that they're in the game. I can see that they're like all this is going on and I'm gonna I'm gonna like

1779
02:15:11.56 --> 02:15:16.04
You know what I'm saying like you think you could have been you could have had that no question about yeah

1780
02:15:16.04 --> 02:15:20.68
No, what did it have mattered at the time? I don't know you know failure as we say is often the best teacher

1781
02:15:20.68 --> 02:15:24.12
Look I made I made great grades in high school and did well on my

1782
02:15:24.12 --> 02:15:29.48
SATs and ACTs without I was almost no study. I got super

1783
02:15:30.76 --> 02:15:33.48
I didn't have the discipline that was in place

1784
02:15:33.88 --> 02:15:36.84
Once I got to the Naval Academy that's structure. It was difficult for me

1785
02:15:36.84 --> 02:15:40.76
It was very hard for me as I went into a system engineering program and and those sort of things

1786
02:15:40.76 --> 02:15:46.44
So I struggled with that so that could help me if somebody had if I'd have learned this one equals freedom at a young age and

1787
02:15:46.68 --> 02:15:49.80
Recognize the power in that I'd be way way more ahead

1788
02:15:49.80 --> 02:15:52.84
You know in life and we all for sure what about playing the game?

1789
02:15:52.84 --> 02:15:58.28
Yep, and playing the game as well right that I'm gonna buck authority of like you know what actually it's gonna be a lot worse for you

1790
02:15:58.28 --> 02:16:03.24
If you just you know even from a just personal perspective not knowing worse for you, but you're for your squad or for your

1791
02:16:03.32 --> 02:16:09.08
You know these folks that you care about if you just build a better relationship with the folks above you and set of being the

1792
02:16:09.48 --> 02:16:11.80
You know hard headed argumentative guy for sure

1793
02:16:11.80 --> 02:16:14.60
It would be way better for me. I don't know when I figured that out

1794
02:16:14.60 --> 02:16:17.40
I mean it was definitely it was definitely in my enlisted time

1795
02:16:17.40 --> 02:16:20.76
I started figuring out that I'm working for a guy and I can either make my life

1796
02:16:20.76 --> 02:16:28.44
I can either tell him he sucks and then my life is gonna suck or I can figure out how to work with him and that's gonna make my life better

1797
02:16:28.44 --> 02:16:32.56
And by the way, it's just I'm just gonna make my life better. It's gonna make us do a better job as a team

1798
02:16:32.56 --> 02:16:37.80
So it's interesting when you pick up on that in life and obviously if I would have been going to the Naval Academy at 18

1799
02:16:38.12 --> 02:16:41.96
You know, I was a knucklehead, you know, I would have been in the same boat of like oh

1800
02:16:41.96 --> 02:16:46.60
I'm gonna stick it to the man right? I mean I'm still listening to it to nature's de-ed age whatever

1801
02:16:46.60 --> 02:16:51.16
We're still sticking it to the man. Well, I'll tell you the people that I really like like my upper class my really like

1802
02:16:51.16 --> 02:16:56.76
We have some there, you know, still serving the seal teams and and a great guy as it helped him for it's me and and I

1803
02:16:57.72 --> 02:16:59.72
Expected when I showed up there I

1804
02:17:00.28 --> 02:17:06.12
Wanted to be a seal there. I wanted to go to war. That's what I wanted to do and it was very hard for me to recognize that like

1805
02:17:06.68 --> 02:17:11.64
Not everybody wanted to do that. It was exactly like me. It was so it was so it was you know

1806
02:17:11.64 --> 02:17:15.08
Some people were a little more academic or wanted to be on the intelligence side or wanted to be

1807
02:17:15.08 --> 02:17:18.52
You know that they wanted to drive a ship or they wanted to be on a submarine or that you know

1808
02:17:18.52 --> 02:17:22.68
They those things that you know fly a plane. I mean top gun it come out

1809
02:17:22.68 --> 02:17:25.88
But you know, we had a whole bunch of people that wanted to be you know pilots that had gone to school

1810
02:17:25.96 --> 02:17:31.80
So it was it was interesting people were a lot different than I expected and and some folks didn't quite have the

1811
02:17:32.44 --> 02:17:36.04
The war like mentality that that I expected everyone might have

1812
02:17:36.60 --> 02:17:41.56
You know going into that environment, but there's no question that if I did done a better job of

1813
02:17:41.56 --> 02:17:46.12
You know you caught playing playing the game just seeing that you know detaching and seeing like hey

1814
02:17:46.12 --> 02:17:51.16
Listen thinking strategically. Yeah, thank you strategically. We want to see if we want to don't want to say play the game because that sounds to

1815
02:17:51.72 --> 02:17:53.72
You want to build relationships

1816
02:17:54.28 --> 02:18:00.84
That is it to do this. I didn't recognize that it was not in my benefit or the benefit of the people around me to

1817
02:18:01.16 --> 02:18:05.64
To create antagonistic relationships and that's a rather than de-escalate those situations

1818
02:18:06.04 --> 02:18:09.80
I Rebellied against them and pushed against them and it was a struggle for me

1819
02:18:09.80 --> 02:18:14.28
Yeah, and it took me a long time to figure that out that that being said though there you know there's

1820
02:18:15.40 --> 02:18:20.44
The naval captain of different than anywhere else. There was great leaders there who mentor people and train people and represented

1821
02:18:20.52 --> 02:18:26.04
You know folks well that were both officers on the staff and and listen on the staff as well as you know is midship and so

1822
02:18:26.60 --> 02:18:28.60
But I think what

1823
02:18:28.60 --> 02:18:35.16
What was a lesson for me and looking back on to now that I recognize it's great to identify who you don't want to be and if someone does something that's

1824
02:18:35.16 --> 02:18:40.92
Looking out for themselves or throws people on the boss or you know those those leaders that you start losing respect for it's great to actually

1825
02:18:40.92 --> 02:18:44.28
Identify that and and that's a good lesson to learn to say okay good

1826
02:18:44.28 --> 02:18:49.000
I want to make sure I don't be that that way, but what what I have learned is that I can't be

1827
02:18:50.12 --> 02:18:54.44
We talked to leaders about this all the time and I get people like what do you do you know when you're boss?

1828
02:18:54.44 --> 02:18:56.44
It just isn't a good leader

1829
02:18:56.44 --> 02:19:04.20
You're like guess what the seal teams is one of the most highly-street organizations in the world what's what's the percentage of

1830
02:19:05.24 --> 02:19:09.08
Senior leaders that I work for that I had respect for that go and work for again

1831
02:19:09.64 --> 02:19:11.96
You know that's maybe maybe 20 percent

1832
02:19:12.28 --> 02:19:16.92
Maybe 20 percent of the people I work for during my time and guess that's about average as you talk to people

1833
02:19:17.24 --> 02:19:20.92
You know it's about average in the business world better it's certainly the naval cabin any of those places

1834
02:19:21.16 --> 02:19:25.24
So if you're expecting that there's most of the world out there is not gonna be a good leader

1835
02:19:25.24 --> 02:19:29.16
It they're not gonna be a leader and that doesn't matter and that shouldn't affect your performance

1836
02:19:29.16 --> 02:19:34.60
You should be able to do you know something that I learned from you which has probably been the most helpful thing that you ever taught me

1837
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:38.60
Was that I should try to have the same relationship with with every boss?

1838
02:19:38.92 --> 02:19:43.56
You know whether I had deep respect and admiration for them or whether I despise them and thought they were you know

1839
02:19:43.88 --> 02:19:54.04
Eagle maniac who you know are a coward who you know could mitigate risk so and that it's in my benefit of my team's benefit to build that relationship with with my team and

1840
02:19:54.04 --> 02:19:57.24
That was that was a lesson that I had not learned then

1841
02:19:58.04 --> 02:20:02.88
So yeah, those negative those negative lessons learned were were good for me and also

1842
02:20:03.32 --> 02:20:07.16
I would have had a less negative lessons learned if I don't figure this out earlier

1843
02:20:07.16 --> 02:20:10.68
Yeah, I'll same and really we got time for like one more question

1844
02:20:11.16 --> 02:20:17.56
But it's almost the same vein so I think it's a good question to ask it says life at what point did you become

1845
02:20:18.28 --> 02:20:20.92
enlightened to extreme ownership

1846
02:20:20.92 --> 02:20:24.44
And how did you respond to the philosophy

1847
02:20:25.08 --> 02:20:30.84
Kind of the same vein of what you were just talking about exactly. I mean I clearly didn't have that fully at the naval Academy

1848
02:20:30.84 --> 02:20:35.40
But I started to understand through the kind of school of hard knocks and falling on my face and getting them much of trouble

1849
02:20:35.40 --> 02:20:40.92
And I was like hey, it doesn't benefit me to rebel against authority or you know not do it up till it or be seen as

1850
02:20:41.16 --> 02:20:45.16
You know is someone who's you know doesn't respect the rules or whatever and and

1851
02:20:46.68 --> 02:20:49.88
I think I started to learn that little more in the surface fleet because I my goal

1852
02:20:49.88 --> 02:20:53.72
I went out surrogate was crushing to me to not be selected out of the naval Academy and

1853
02:20:54.76 --> 02:20:56.52
To go into the steel program

1854
02:20:56.52 --> 02:20:59.38
So as I went out to the and served on a couple different surface ships

1855
02:20:59.38 --> 02:21:04.60
I recognize like the what is the pathway for me to to the seal teams my lifelong dream

1856
02:21:04.60 --> 02:21:06.60
That's all I want to do and it was

1857
02:21:07.56 --> 02:21:14.60
Be the best freaking surface warfare officer now you got to just so everyone knows now you got to earn a recommendation to go and do this

1858
02:21:14.60 --> 02:21:15.96
So if you're not the best

1859
02:21:15.96 --> 02:21:21.08
Fleet officer you could possibly be someone's gonna go why would you why would you send to the sealed teams and you you're not even doing a good job here

1860
02:21:21.08 --> 02:21:25.56
No, so you got to earn a reputation you also have to and a recommendation for sure

1861
02:21:26.12 --> 02:21:29.48
You so you have to build that trust with your bosses and you have to get qualified

1862
02:21:29.56 --> 02:21:35.56
So they've got to trust you and you have to achieve that qualification you're not even eligible until you achieve your warfare qualification

1863
02:21:35.56 --> 02:21:41.16
So when you report about a border ship you have to do certain qualifications that say okay

1864
02:21:41.16 --> 02:21:43.88
Yes, you are now a surface warfare officer

1865
02:21:43.88 --> 02:21:51.08
Qualified surface warfare officer there's a bunch of boxes you got a check and it's boxes you got to learn all kinds of information about all the

1866
02:21:51.32 --> 02:21:55.80
Hundreds of different systems and until you get that you're not even gonna get you're not getting a recommendation

1867
02:21:55.80 --> 02:21:59.96
You're not even eligible you're not even eligible so you had to just you had to get so I had to

1868
02:21:59.96 --> 02:22:08.76
Crazy and that and that and that helped me and I still had friction certainly and and but I started recognizing like what works and what doesn't and but it wasn't really until

1869
02:22:08.76 --> 02:22:15.48
Test-game bruiser that's where you really quantify that for me and and you know as as we are going through

1870
02:22:15.48 --> 02:22:18.60
I was in my second opportunity so I'd already been through a previous opportunity and

1871
02:22:19.80 --> 02:22:25.56
And I didn't even realize like as in that second the second button is we were working to task in a bruiser with charted up a tune

1872
02:22:25.56 --> 02:22:26.44
I was like

1873
02:22:26.44 --> 02:22:27.80
Man, we're good

1874
02:22:27.80 --> 02:22:31.64
We're performing well and when we started having you know a few months into the work-up cycle

1875
02:22:32.04 --> 02:22:36.12
We'd have you know training instructors be like you guys are the best task in a we've ever seen come through here

1876
02:22:36.12 --> 02:22:41.96
And it was interesting to me because I thought I was like well, I don't really I mean we have some amazing guys in this task in it

1877
02:22:41.96 --> 02:22:47.40
But I had amazing guys in my last task gonna do we had very time and so it's not really the talent fact of the broke us out

1878
02:22:47.40 --> 02:22:50.28
You know and and I didn't even realize

1879
02:22:51.16 --> 02:22:55.40
Certainly wasn't that we didn't make mistakes because we made all kinds of mistakes in task in a bruiser and you know

1880
02:22:55.40 --> 02:23:02.16
Disaster is training operations. We had to come back and revamp our training process and and make sure that we dialed in standard operating procedures

1881
02:23:02.16 --> 02:23:08.16
Just what training space exactly and right exactly. That's the difference really yeah, and that was it

1882
02:23:08.16 --> 02:23:13.44
It was this idea that we now call extreme ownership which is we're gonna take ownership of this and instead of me

1883
02:23:13.44 --> 02:23:16.52
Like hey we're gonna push back against people or tell us we need to be better

1884
02:23:16.52 --> 02:23:22.80
Or we're gonna even maybe even deny that we're as bad as we are we're gonna take a brutally honest assessment of ourselves

1885
02:23:22.80 --> 02:23:26.000
And that that was one thing that really stands out to me as I think about it

1886
02:23:26.32 --> 02:23:29.20
Do you remember our our debriefs that the training instructors?

1887
02:23:29.20 --> 02:23:32.08
They're usually have a super lengthy and critical debriefs

1888
02:23:32.40 --> 02:23:38.04
We would debrief ourselves after a run because they let the late let the buttons and the taskings go first and so often

1889
02:23:38.44 --> 02:23:43.28
It was the only time I ever saw it to out my you know my nine years in the sealed teams that

1890
02:23:43.72 --> 02:23:50.56
That that most of the time we would get done debriefing ourselves and the training instructors did not have

1891
02:23:50.56 --> 02:23:54.48
They had either nothing to say or maybe just a couple sentences and that was it

1892
02:23:54.48 --> 02:23:58.80
Yeah, because we'd rip ourselves to shred because we we were that was such a brutally honest

1893
02:23:58.80 --> 02:24:02.24
Assessment of and sometimes they be like hey, I actually thought you guys did pretty good

1894
02:24:02.72 --> 02:24:07.16
No, we're yeah we're working and that's actually you told you told them right

1895
02:24:07.16 --> 02:24:09.96
Yeah, they say there were see you don't ever tell my guys that

1896
02:24:10.60 --> 02:24:16.20
They're doing you know they're amazing that's the best one they've ever seen because that that allows us to not get better

1897
02:24:16.20 --> 02:24:19.76
To not grow to get complacent so we always did that and I think that's I

1898
02:24:20.16 --> 02:24:23.88
Was starting I recognize just how powerful that was to our performance

1899
02:24:23.88 --> 02:24:28.92
So again, we were never flawless we always made we made mistakes but we learned from those mistakes we got better

1900
02:24:28.92 --> 02:24:34.18
We grew all the time and we were able to run circles around everybody else as a result and deliver some

1901
02:24:34.56 --> 02:24:38.24
Exceptional performance on the battlefield with that attitude and that's you know

1902
02:24:38.24 --> 02:24:41.36
That that mindset and attitude is is the game changer

1903
02:24:41.36 --> 02:24:47.60
That's why we call the book extreme ownership and it's what we impart to people is as we we see in the business world

1904
02:24:47.60 --> 02:24:49.44
And it there's at the end of the day is what works

1905
02:24:49.44 --> 02:24:56.24
There's what doesn't work, but that task in a bruiser and working with you and recognizing what that is and how powerful that is

1906
02:24:57.04 --> 02:25:02.16
That's that's made all the difference. It's crazy to see and I'd see this all the time that well

1907
02:25:02.16 --> 02:25:06.54
You just think about what you're saying it when the training cadre for instance tells you hey

1908
02:25:07.36 --> 02:25:10.000
It took you guys a long time to get ahead count

1909
02:25:10.80 --> 02:25:14.24
Meaning you're on the target and you want to leave the target before you leave the target

1910
02:25:14.24 --> 02:25:16.88
You've got to know that you've got all your people so you want to get ahead count

1911
02:25:16.88 --> 02:25:21.20
So the training cadre says hey it took you guys a long time to get ahead count

1912
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:25.44
Now you can do one of two things here you can say okay

1913
02:25:25.88 --> 02:25:30.000
That's criticism how could we get a faster head count?

1914
02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:31.88
Hey guys anyone ever done this a different way?

1915
02:25:31.88 --> 02:25:36.32
Yeah, I have used this process in the past it works really good. Okay. Let's try that. Oh, that worked better

1916
02:25:36.32 --> 02:25:40.000
And we've do this one little thing it can be even a little bit faster. Okay. Let's rehearse it

1917
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.56
Let's actually try and rehearse it. Okay, boom now we're getting really good

1918
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:48.88
So so we take that and all of a sudden the next time we go out we do a little bit better and then we've modified a little bit more and all of a sudden

1919
02:25:48.88 --> 02:25:52.56
We can get ahead count in 15 seconds instead of four minutes

1920
02:25:52.56 --> 02:25:54.72
Which is a huge difference when you're trying to leave a target

1921
02:25:54.72 --> 02:25:57.68
So that's one attitude to have that's like we're gonna take ownership of the problems

1922
02:25:57.92 --> 02:26:03.52
But I would see this all the time which is hey guys your your head count was a little slow and

1923
02:26:03.92 --> 02:26:05.92
Guys go wasn't that bad

1924
02:26:06.56 --> 02:26:10.40
Wasn't that bad and when it took us four minutes four minutes is not that big of a deal

1925
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:14.80
We like or like do that guy's saying that right now

1926
02:26:14.80 --> 02:26:19.52
But I'd like to see him get ahead count faster than that and we did it as fast as we could do it

1927
02:26:19.52 --> 02:26:23.44
Everyone counted as fast we could and we made it through the first time that took us three minutes

1928
02:26:23.44 --> 02:26:25.28
And they're gonna say that's not good enough

1929
02:26:25.84 --> 02:26:30.48
Don't worry about that and so so you're gonna stay on that pattern and you never get better and you're never gonna get better

1930
02:26:30.72 --> 02:26:36.40
And it's cuz you're not looking you're you're not accepting criticism from the outside and it's like when we see that with leaders now

1931
02:26:36.40 --> 02:26:40.000
I start laughing about the date David I was working with it with a team and

1932
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:45.52
And we had that say it comes up all the time and it's funny when you see people pushing back I get some some real

1933
02:26:46.40 --> 02:26:49.76
Contractor criticism and my question is always like okay

1934
02:26:50.64 --> 02:26:53.68
I said it's just you know that battle of egos there. I look at that and say okay

1935
02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.72
You're telling just just let me understand you're telling me that you

1936
02:26:57.36 --> 02:27:01.36
You are at absolute optimal performance you could never improve in any way

1937
02:27:01.36 --> 02:27:05.84
In that is that is that what you're saying and obviously then they recognize like of course not

1938
02:27:05.84 --> 02:27:11.76
So so that kind of opens the door of yeah, you can improve and you should improve and if you're not what you taught me is

1939
02:27:12.24 --> 02:27:16.88
Not only should you improve I think the big lesson that I learned from you and that and we now

1940
02:27:16.88 --> 02:27:21.44
You know teach here with that song for honest is that if not only should you improve

1941
02:27:21.76 --> 02:27:27.44
But if you're not trying to do better if you're not doing everything you can to have the most efficient and effective head count

1942
02:27:28.08 --> 02:27:33.20
That you can and improve and every aspect of your game all the time that you're actually failing

1943
02:27:33.20 --> 02:27:37.76
You're as a leader and you're failing your team and I think that's a very fundamental difference of looking at it

1944
02:27:37.76 --> 02:27:39.92
Yeah, that it's not just no I should be doing that

1945
02:27:39.92 --> 02:27:44.80
But no if I'm not doing that I'm a failure is a leader and I'm failing my team yeah all this is weird

1946
02:27:44.80 --> 02:27:47.68
You know talking about this head count thing it's it's a great example

1947
02:27:47.68 --> 02:27:51.28
I'm surprised I haven't talked about it very much because it's a it's a really big deal like

1948
02:27:51.76 --> 02:27:55.20
Friends and when you leave a target you can't leave until you know that you have all your guys

1949
02:27:55.44 --> 02:27:58.64
So you got to get a head count there's multiple different ways to get a head count and

1950
02:27:58.64 --> 02:28:04.48
The easiest way is you use decentralized command and every little team leader counts there three or four guys

1951
02:28:04.48 --> 02:28:09.12
And they go yep ones up to is up three's up and they report in up one level and by the time

1952
02:28:09.12 --> 02:28:12.08
I would need to head count I'd look at life and and the Delta Poom commander

1953
02:28:12.08 --> 02:28:14.80
And I'd be like, are we up and it would take them 10 seconds a bit more up

1954
02:28:15.76 --> 02:28:21.44
The the way the worst way to do it which I would also see would be you would literally count

1955
02:28:22.48 --> 02:28:28.08
From from the lowest guy there's 36 guys in the troop and someone would say hey head count

1956
02:28:28.08 --> 02:28:36.72
And the back guy would go 36 35 and they would you'd have a signed numbers 35 34 33 32

1957
02:28:38.80 --> 02:28:44.56
How you sturdy one oh over here third wait you're 31 no I'm 32

1958
02:28:45.60 --> 02:28:52.24
Did you count and see that you need it takes three minutes four minutes and and yet it's like well that that's a very sensible way on

1959
02:28:52.56 --> 02:28:56.32
Paper to do it because you know you're gonna have all your people but in reality doesn't work

1960
02:28:56.32 --> 02:29:01.04
And that's that one and so this is that one little thing right this one little thing one little improvement you can make

1961
02:29:01.60 --> 02:29:06.80
But but that's not the only improvement you can make you can improve every little thing that you do and

1962
02:29:07.36 --> 02:29:12.24
Every little thing that you do in a team everything that you do as an individual human being you can make it just a little bit better

1963
02:29:12.24 --> 02:29:15.68
And the minute that you're you're you're sitting back in your your phone

1964
02:29:15.68 --> 02:29:17.68
You know what I'm I'm not gonna make this change anymore

1965
02:29:18.48 --> 02:29:23.92
I'm I've reached my panic goal of performance in this category the minute that you're do that

1966
02:29:23.92 --> 02:29:27.44
It's not just one category that you're slacking off on it's all of them

1967
02:29:27.44 --> 02:29:31.38
And I was telling you guys the other day. I'm like you know when you see me post a

1968
02:29:31.84 --> 02:29:35.72
Picture in the morning that it say I'm gonna get up but I'm knocking up at 430

1969
02:29:35.72 --> 02:29:42.32
If it says 435 that means I got up at 430 you know got out of bed and I went in and and and I took a picture

1970
02:29:42.32 --> 02:29:44.64
I watched and I posted when I'm posting it at

1971
02:29:45.20 --> 02:29:46.88
408

1972
02:29:46.88 --> 02:29:49.52
That means I woke up and I was like I got to get busy

1973
02:29:49.52 --> 02:29:54.16
It's like it's not all it's not a long clock. I'm gotta get I gotta go do I gotta go make these things happen

1974
02:29:54.16 --> 02:29:58.88
I got to look and see where I can improve my method for getting a head count

1975
02:29:58.88 --> 02:30:04.24
How can I make it that much faster that one little thing and when you look at your array of what's you're going on in your business

1976
02:30:04.24 --> 02:30:06.80
And it's also in your life do what can you do a little bit better?

1977
02:30:07.76 --> 02:30:14.32
You attack those problems you accept the criticism when it comes at you which is so hard for everyone to do myself included

1978
02:30:14.32 --> 02:30:22.88
You accept the criticism listen to it and then you modify and you make these little iterative changes and at the end instead of being a

1979
02:30:23.28 --> 02:30:29.68
Decent task unit or instead of being a decent person or instead of running a decent team you can be the best and

1980
02:30:30.40 --> 02:30:32.40
That's

1981
02:30:32.40 --> 02:30:34.40
Only happens

1982
02:30:34.40 --> 02:30:37.68
If you take ownership of what's going on in your world

1983
02:30:39.92 --> 02:30:41.92
With that

1984
02:30:41.92 --> 02:30:43.92
Echo Charles

1985
02:30:43.92 --> 02:30:47.84
Speaking of taking ownership trying to get better

1986
02:30:48.72 --> 02:30:51.92
Yes, maybe you can help us out with that a little bit. I don't know. Yeah, that's possible

1987
02:30:51.92 --> 02:30:54.80
That's interesting know like where when you put into perspective

1988
02:30:56.000 --> 02:31:01.36
Extreme ownership because you know how you say the biggest or one of the the biggest best qualities of a leader is humility

1989
02:31:01.36 --> 02:31:07.36
Humility. You see the tie in right now right more so you know yes because you figure okay

1990
02:31:07.92 --> 02:31:12.56
So yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a little bit of a stripe but other stripe on the on the leadership white belt

1991
02:31:12.56 --> 02:31:18.04
There you go. So you you get a team of people all different you know

1992
02:31:19.20 --> 02:31:23.52
Personality whatever he goes different varying levels right so for little

1993
02:31:23.52 --> 02:31:28.32
This is gonna be all these little problems. No one's perfect. No one's optimal right that's kind of the goal

1994
02:31:28.48 --> 02:31:31.92
Even if it's unattainable perfection right that's kind of the goal optimal

1995
02:31:32.24 --> 02:31:40.96
Then you have a team with however many mistakes it make and then as they train perform all this stuff all the little mistakes get pointed out

1996
02:31:40.96 --> 02:31:47.68
And it's almost like the self self correcting organism we hope it is like that's why yes

1997
02:31:47.68 --> 02:31:50.76
You hope it is so like if you compare it to like come machine learning situation

1998
02:31:50.76 --> 02:31:53.56
It does that because it doesn't have a ego. I don't take things personal

1999
02:31:53.56 --> 02:31:58.48
It's kind of like let me just solve all the little problems and then that's what they can grow and

2000
02:31:58.48 --> 02:32:01.60
That's peninsula. It's right the thing that's awesome about that though is that you get

2001
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.92
What I think what you're talking about is building the culture right so you get if the leaders doing that

2002
02:32:05.92 --> 02:32:09.88
And you get the team doing that once once people recognize like hey look how much better

2003
02:32:09.88 --> 02:32:14.28
We are at head counts. Yeah, even if ours is it that then you start getting junior leadership

2004
02:32:14.28 --> 02:32:18.36
Who's new you know frontline troops new guys who you know they come up with an idea

2005
02:32:18.36 --> 02:32:24.44
Here's the way we can do this little bit they're solving problems. You don't even see yeah, it's a same that the other day, you know

2006
02:32:24.44 --> 02:32:26.44
I was

2007
02:32:26.44 --> 02:32:28.68
I was in a training situation the other day and

2008
02:32:29.08 --> 02:32:34.20
I saw things go bad for this group. It was a military group and and things were going bad

2009
02:32:34.60 --> 02:32:37.96
They worked they they all dropped the ball. They all kind of didn't drop the ball

2010
02:32:37.96 --> 02:32:42.20
They're slack there. They were slack and I was thinking to myself

2011
02:32:42.20 --> 02:32:46.36
I wouldn't see a a young new guy machine gunner

2012
02:32:46.84 --> 02:32:54.04
Not getting a good position. I would never see that with my eyes because the guy that was immediately senior to him would would straight them out

2013
02:32:54.76 --> 02:32:57.24
There would be no slack right there there would be no socket

2014
02:32:57.32 --> 02:33:02.36
He'd get straight now. So by the time I show up and I look around everyone's doing amazingly well

2015
02:33:02.36 --> 02:33:08.36
Everything's the way it should be it's not quite optimal, but it's damn close and why is that?

2016
02:33:08.36 --> 02:33:10.68
It's because what you just said life. It's because every

2017
02:33:11.48 --> 02:33:16.92
Leader every individual leader and every person is adjusting and making things making adjustments that I'm not even seeing

2018
02:33:17.48 --> 02:33:22.52
And why are they doing that number one because they're all humble enough to look that they need to change things and number two

2019
02:33:22.92 --> 02:33:28.60
Everyone in the group has their ego in checks. So when someone says hey shift your field of fire a little bit to the west

2020
02:33:28.84 --> 02:33:30.84
The guy doesn't say why

2021
02:33:30.84 --> 02:33:34.92
Yeah, no he goes I wonder why oh I see because he's got another guy over there that's covering that field

2022
02:33:34.92 --> 02:33:39.64
Fuck got it got it boss. Yeah, that's that's what that's it now we have like like a machine

2023
02:33:39.88 --> 02:33:44.04
That's just improving all the time. Yeah, which is what we're going for and if you lack humility

2024
02:33:44.68 --> 02:33:49.16
In any any any any one of those levels you're you're you're gonna slow down that machine progress

2025
02:33:49.16 --> 02:33:54.44
That process fully the yeah, so it's weird when you look at it from the big picture, you know and you see like

2026
02:33:54.76 --> 02:33:59.64
Just like how you're saying when you kind of mentally compared your current team with you know teams in the past like oh

2027
02:33:59.64 --> 02:34:03.08
There was talented guys on the other side on the other teams that I was on too

2028
02:34:04.04 --> 02:34:05.64
But you kind of

2029
02:34:05.64 --> 02:34:07.64
Understand and recognize that one

2030
02:34:07.96 --> 02:34:13.48
Factors that everyone's kind of humble and it's always constantly like what can I do better right here with my

2031
02:34:14.60 --> 02:34:17.32
You know situation in my own little world here

2032
02:34:17.48 --> 02:34:22.28
But everyone's doing that so it's like this if you if you kind of collectively consider this group

2033
02:34:22.28 --> 02:34:29.16
They're just bumbleble themselves and I take it one step forward just just once that further just so everyone can think about how to implement that

2034
02:34:29.16 --> 02:34:34.28
in your world the way you implement it isn't by saying guys

2035
02:34:35.64 --> 02:34:38.28
The head count will slow you need to fix it

2036
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.32
It's not by saying hey the approach to the target was too loud you need to be quiet

2037
02:34:44.28 --> 02:34:46.92
That's not how you fix the problem you say hey guys

2038
02:34:48.92 --> 02:34:52.60
Our head count is taking too long. I need to come up with a better way to do it

2039
02:34:53.16 --> 02:34:57.40
I need to I need to figure this out or hey guys we were too noisy going to the target

2040
02:34:57.40 --> 02:35:03.72
I need to make sure that you have the gear that you need to and I need to make sure we all understand how important it is to be quiet going to the target

2041
02:35:03.72 --> 02:35:05.72
Hmm, I think I was too loud

2042
02:35:06.92 --> 02:35:09.16
Right, I think I was too loud now everyone says damn

2043
02:35:09.72 --> 02:35:15.000
Like these blame it himself for being too loud, but I'm the one that was over there my drop my cantine it made a bunch of noise in the rocks

2044
02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:16.20
I was my fault

2045
02:35:16.20 --> 02:35:18.20
I'm gonna tighten myself up

2046
02:35:18.60 --> 02:35:24.12
As opposed to blaming everyone and we talk about this all the time the minute you're blaming everyone everyone's just you know

2047
02:35:24.12 --> 02:35:28.04
They're looking for excuse to blame and you you don't understand how hard it is to carry that can't team quietly

2048
02:35:28.04 --> 02:35:31.16
And I was thirsty because I've been carrying the machine gun and I need to get water right there

2049
02:35:31.16 --> 02:35:33.16
I was gonna get dehydrated. They're making excuses

2050
02:35:33.96 --> 02:35:37.24
And the machine can't self-crank the machine can't self-crank

2051
02:35:37.24 --> 02:35:41.40
Just stays in the one inefficient ineffective place mode

2052
02:35:42.68 --> 02:35:44.68
Speaking of machines

2053
02:35:44.68 --> 02:35:47.80
Machines need oil not necessarily krill oil, but

2054
02:35:48.84 --> 02:35:51.24
We need krill oil be plushed if you do it

2055
02:35:51.24 --> 02:35:53.24
If you did

2056
02:35:53.72 --> 02:35:59.40
Jocquat supplements good news. I just took my jacquo krill oil this morning gets up me too

2057
02:36:00.28 --> 02:36:02.28
Every day don't forget

2058
02:36:02.28 --> 02:36:06.92
Can't slack on that thanks for bringing me some krill oil in New York to by the way

2059
02:36:06.92 --> 02:36:10.76
Yeah, you still owe me a bottle for them. Yeah, I don't know problem. I know a guy

2060
02:36:11.40 --> 02:36:17.08
He's name is jacquo and the krill oil is called jacquo super krill and join warfare by the way

2061
02:36:17.08 --> 02:36:23.08
Which is another joint supplement you know maintain the physical capabilities of your body?

2062
02:36:23.80 --> 02:36:28.12
I said don't forget to take it and don't run out by the way

2063
02:36:28.52 --> 02:36:32.68
I ran out before but if you're running out there is a subscription option

2064
02:36:33.40 --> 02:36:41.000
By real best by request. Yeah, you get it lot every month you can get it every month every two weeks. This was cool about because the indicator

2065
02:36:41.88 --> 02:36:43.88
was

2066
02:36:43.88 --> 02:36:51.16
When people order krill oil join warfare guess what they do they order more yeah, and then they order more and so then the request

2067
02:36:51.16 --> 02:36:53.64
We're can we just put it on subscription so there

2068
02:36:53.64 --> 02:37:01.48
I mean, I don't I just take three of them three of each boom, but I'd never read like how much should I be taking this a little bit more like strong

2069
02:37:01.48 --> 02:37:07.16
Right like this more I I'll tell you what I take I take three of each in the morning and

2070
02:37:08.20 --> 02:37:10.20
I take three

2071
02:37:10.20 --> 02:37:17.64
Yeah, I know that's good and that's fine, but what is the recommended you also talk like I that you know orders the 40 out of stay

2072
02:37:17.64 --> 02:37:19.64
Two more is better

2073
02:37:20.20 --> 02:37:26.68
After 40 are I would say I would say depending on your way, but I'd say like two and two take two of each in the morning

2074
02:37:26.68 --> 02:37:31.40
Two of each at night and also you can also do this you can also you know

2075
02:37:31.96 --> 02:37:37.88
See where you're at right like you know what it feels like when you haven't been taking like you yeah, so then up the dose

2076
02:37:37.88 --> 02:37:44.36
That's right, I've been real real confident with what I'm at yeah, I mean two three three for me not twice it one one time

2077
02:37:44.76 --> 02:37:46.36
Three in three boom morning

2078
02:37:46.36 --> 02:37:50.92
I gotta get on the subscription. Let's get I like that option because I I run out and

2079
02:37:51.80 --> 02:37:53.96
And then it takes you know days and yeah

2080
02:37:54.20 --> 02:37:59.72

Cognitive enhances micro dose of

2087
02:38:27.72 --> 02:38:34.04
Caffeine if you're into it just like jocco wait to life. You're all just in the bottom just sample so

2088
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:41.72
Yeah, see tasty which is I mean maybe yeah, I mean again I know I said it before but

2089
02:38:42.44 --> 02:38:46.68
It doesn't seem like you're all like focused on taste because you're not focused on looks

2090
02:38:46.68 --> 02:38:50.84
No, seems same not at all yeah, but you like the taste of yeah

2091
02:38:50.84 --> 02:38:55.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and make sure stuff tastes good apparently, but it is good stuff

2092
02:38:55.80 --> 02:38:57.000
I

2093
02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:01.64
Take that one every day too. When do you take it morning now pre

2094
02:39:02.60 --> 02:39:09.80
Pre-day life three day man, you know why the way I see it is like there's no caffeine or there's not like huge amounts of caffeine

2095
02:39:09.80 --> 02:39:14.60
So it's like okay if I'm gonna take a little dose. Yeah, I rip that off from 10 first

2096
02:39:15.16 --> 02:39:18.92
My kid they talk about micro dosing LSD and micro dosing

2097
02:39:19.48 --> 02:39:23.56
Psycho drugs whatever sounds cool. That's not really my thing

2098
02:39:23.56 --> 02:39:27.64
Yeah, well I'll take a little micro dose of caffeine 15 milligrams sure

2099
02:39:28.52 --> 02:39:30.84
But give you a little glimpse into this spirit world

2100
02:39:32.44 --> 02:39:36.36
I don't think you to do it. Well the LSD might yes for sure. Did not get some of that

2101
02:39:37.48 --> 02:39:40.20
That's what it's gonna be. Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2102
02:39:40.20 --> 02:39:43.80
Let me get some of that some time. I just figured the like the cognitive

2103
02:39:44.76 --> 02:39:50.20
And enhancing nutrients. I figure that's like a thing that's not like a drug

2104
02:39:50.20 --> 02:39:55.80
Right the nutrient so let's see taking every day so you brain is just generally more capable

2105
02:39:57.40 --> 02:40:00.92
It's just what I figured maybe that's why he's answering all these good questions. They got the discipline

2106
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:06.12
And the man the neurons are firing I've been on it. That's why I got those stripes

2107
02:40:06.84 --> 02:40:08.84
19% increase in performance

2108
02:40:08.84 --> 02:40:12.36
Thanks for and then the rest of your to do that by the way also anyway

2109
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.88
Get them at origin mean dot com also at origin mean

2110
02:40:15.88 --> 02:40:20.12
dot com is where you get your key straight up

2111
02:40:22.04 --> 02:40:26.28
You have an origin key. I do have an origin key in there. They're awesome. I got comments on all the time

2112
02:40:26.28 --> 02:40:30.60
They're they're great geese they're they're super lightweight but they're super strong and and

2113
02:40:31.32 --> 02:40:36.28
Yeah, definitely my favorite key. I'm looking at get another one mine two and made an America by the way

2114
02:40:36.28 --> 02:40:40.60
Brian emailed me yesterday. You might think that's the best thing about origin geese

2115
02:40:40.60 --> 02:40:45.64
That it's made in America, but then it's not because we get the gene you realize that yeah, it's awesome

2116
02:40:45.64 --> 02:40:49.16
Yeah, because if it was made in America and then you were like cluster full

2117
02:40:49.16 --> 02:40:52.44
I was so lucky the other night. I was rolling in the deaf key

2118
02:40:54.28 --> 02:40:56.28
Sir, yeah

2119
02:40:56.28 --> 02:41:01.40
The interesting thing we obviously we know a lot of fashion guy right well. I mean clearly

2120
02:41:01.40 --> 02:41:02.36
I'm not a fashion

2121
02:41:02.36 --> 02:41:07.000
Yeah, we can we can tell you want to see your stories you tell life tell stories about my fashion

2122
02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:14.20
Asked in 1987 tape of jeans and a dinner combat boots. Hey, that's how I roll

2123
02:41:14.60 --> 02:41:16.60
But when you put on the deaf key

2124
02:41:17.40 --> 02:41:21.48
Everyone says something. Why is that it's just because it looks because it's not flashy

2125
02:41:22.28 --> 02:41:25.48
It just says this morning was freedom and then it says get out of the house

2126
02:41:25.48 --> 02:41:30.04
In the back. That's it every time I walk by people when I'd walk by then I'd hear going get after it

2127
02:41:30.44 --> 02:41:33.48
Yeah, yeah, and you know what Pete is like that though

2128
02:41:33.48 --> 02:41:38.20
He has like an element of fashion in his stuff. No, I got to put him in check on that

2129
02:41:38.20 --> 02:41:43.48
Yeah, I could go back and forth a little bit and like hey you got to put that in check. You know you want it because he made some

2130
02:41:45.08 --> 02:41:51.96
He made some spats. Oh, yes, which is an approved term now. Yes, wait compression pants compression pants tights

2131
02:41:52.76 --> 02:41:54.76
Is what's your friend call them

2132
02:41:54.76 --> 02:41:57.80
Spada but anyways, he made something that was it like leggings

2133
02:41:57.80 --> 02:42:04.60
No, they're jeans with their legs. I know this because my daughter has some and it's his jeans

2134
02:42:04.60 --> 02:42:07.64
Like what does he know? He knows you don't know the leggings are come on

2135
02:42:08.04 --> 02:42:10.44
They're like leggings slash jeans

2136
02:42:11.80 --> 02:42:16.68
Well, yeah, Pete has more fashion sense because he's got that whole design thing going on

2137
02:42:17.24 --> 02:42:20.68
Like he's a designer. Yeah, he's a creative. I know you listen feet

2138
02:42:20.68 --> 02:42:25.08
You know you're all designing stuff up there me. I'm like make it black. Yeah. Yeah

2139
02:42:25.08 --> 02:42:29.000
Oh, what can we add to it more black and what kind of shape be you want in the waist lighter?

2140
02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.96
You look like I don't know but that can stuff but Pete's like I don't worry

2141
02:42:31.96 --> 02:42:34.68
I got it and that's why until he designed the

2142
02:42:35.56 --> 02:42:39.80
Multicolored spats. Well, that's just like just taking it again

2143
02:42:39.80 --> 02:42:47.40
I can't even I can't even I might I have to put myself in check here because I realize that that is beyond my domain of competency

2144
02:42:47.64 --> 02:42:49.88
Right there. That is a way beyond my domain of competency

2145
02:42:49.88 --> 02:42:52.68
So if you want to get those spats go for it

2146
02:42:52.68 --> 02:42:59.24
Being it but to Pete's credit guess what they have now black black spats. There you go if you need them

2147
02:42:59.24 --> 02:43:04.44
You can get them boom, but even he's even the other guise though people before I got the deaf one

2148
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:08.84
People would be like oh, that's a nice guise. Well, what's really interesting is when you see the weave

2149
02:43:09.40 --> 02:43:12.12
Yeah, weave is what makes it

2150
02:43:12.12 --> 02:43:17.48
Gorilla leaf. Yeah, but there's like this little pattern in the bag and actually the first one of the first ones

2151
02:43:17.48 --> 02:43:20.76
I actually held was yours life because you you've got an origin guise for a long time

2152
02:43:20.76 --> 02:43:25.08
Yeah, because you asked me a long time ago before I was even with origin you're like hey, what kind of geisha

2153
02:43:25.08 --> 02:43:26.44
I said get a damn origin

2154
02:43:26.44 --> 02:43:28.68
You have this amazing awesome company you were telling me about it

2155
02:43:28.68 --> 02:43:32.44
And yeah, you know, you went and got one I went ball one and I was like

2156
02:43:32.68 --> 02:43:36.60
Amp this thing is nice, but yeah, this is a pattern. All right cool. We get it. Sorry

2157
02:43:36.92 --> 02:43:37.72
What I'm just saying?

2158
02:43:37.72 --> 02:43:41.96
Even though he don't care about the fashion and Pete will sneak it in there just for like an appropriate amount of fashion

2159
02:43:41.96 --> 02:43:49.24
I got to watch out for Pete subtle fashion. It's good keep it up Pete. I think also some rash guards there all made America and some other stuff

02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:38.68
English Peter and English Peter was gonna go shooting with someone and he says hey, you don't want to go

02:45:38.68 --> 02:45:42.60
He says hey, I'm gonna go shooting but you like come maybe we could work on some cover and move

2232
02:48:58.60 --> 02:49:01.36
Okay, yeah, approved and then you know

2233
02:49:01.36 --> 02:49:03.36
Actually it's called back to the book

2234
02:49:03.36 --> 02:49:08.84
No surprise we talked about it before but I think it's coming along with a few layers on there and

2235
02:49:08.84 --> 02:49:11.82
You know I'm gonna go ahead and off right off for it up. Yeah

2236
02:49:11.82 --> 02:49:15.24
You can't release it until there's enough layers. Yes. No, yeah

2237
02:49:15.24 --> 02:49:21.24
Layer list shirts are on a proof who is the most the shirt that I designed is the most layered shirt is that correct?

2238
02:49:21.24 --> 02:49:23.24
Yes, I think that's good

2239
02:49:23.24 --> 02:49:25.24
That's good

2240
02:49:25.24 --> 02:49:30.96
You submitted quite easily. Yeah, it's true the truth. You have the Woody call it the gift of truth or what it was it?

2241
02:49:30.96 --> 02:49:36.000
I don't know you know when when they're like hey, what if the our competition is gossiping about us?

2242
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.96
You have the oh, yeah, they have the big weapon. Yeah, the web stream truth the high ground

2243
02:49:40.32 --> 02:49:42.64
Yeah, so you got numbers on your site none the less

2244
02:49:42.64 --> 02:49:50.40
Jockels door.com. That's where you can get all the cool stuff. Check it out if you want something get something also psychological warfare

2245
02:49:50.40 --> 02:49:54.60
If you know what that is it's an album with tracks jocquat tracks

2246
02:49:56.12 --> 02:50:00.28
When you run into those moments of weakness and your campaign against weakness

2247
02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:02.28
Speaking of which

2248
02:50:02.28 --> 02:50:06.04
So I'm getting my car you know I've got thousands of songs of my iTunes

2249
02:50:06.04 --> 02:50:10.76
Yeah, I get my car. You know how to it I have my Bluetooth on and it realized it

2250
02:50:10.76 --> 02:50:18.28
But it just automatically synced up my truck. I jump on my truck and I didn't realize the radio was it kind of a high ball

2251
02:50:18.28 --> 02:50:23.96
Apparently I think my kids were by screaming in the back seats. I'll play like some kid tunes, but I get in there

2252
02:50:25.24 --> 02:50:29.60
I get in there and and all of a sudden it's like joccos voice

2253
02:50:29.60 --> 02:50:35.86
I mean I get it I'm not paying attention back and up and it's like it's kind of where does discipline come

2254
02:50:35.86 --> 02:50:41.86
And it of all the random you know thousands of songs that I have on my iTunes that comes up

2255
02:50:41.86 --> 02:50:44.98
I was like what are the odds and it was actually something I needed to hear at that moment

2256
02:50:45.98 --> 02:50:51.66
And to remind me to give back on the path. So there you go. That is something that's extremely helpful perfect and

2257
02:50:53.90 --> 02:50:55.90
The universe

2258
02:50:55.90 --> 02:50:56.90
Universalized

2259
02:50:56.90 --> 02:51:04.18
I got go Charles for that and because echo Charles originally said to me like hey, what do you do here and I answered him some question?

2260
02:51:04.18 --> 02:51:08.74
It was like when I skip work. Yeah, what do you he's equal? How do you not skip workouts? And I was like I bump up a bump up a

2261
02:51:09.22 --> 02:51:10.90
He's like bro

2262
02:51:10.90 --> 02:51:14.02
We need to record that and put it out so people can listen to it

2263
02:51:14.02 --> 02:51:17.46
He's like and you should answer the rest of me should about what what how do you get out of that charge?

2264
02:51:17.46 --> 02:51:22.30
I was just all right ask me the questions and that's where came from echo Charles. Yeah, a little additional thing

2265
02:51:22.54 --> 02:51:26.34
You know how the kind of enough you've run into this where you're like I have

2266
02:51:27.54 --> 02:51:29.22
Confused or I don't have the answer for this thing

2267
02:51:29.22 --> 02:51:35.42
So I'm gonna I'm gonna ask jockel what is just what is he think right as you're asking him you're like, oh, I know what he's gonna say right

2268
02:51:36.14 --> 02:51:39.70
So this one he was like, oh, I know what this guy's gonna say right now

2269
02:51:39.70 --> 02:51:46.46
You should stop being weak or something like that so it's more like I get it stop being weak. Okay, but

2270
02:51:47.38 --> 02:51:50.86
There's a little bit more to that like what do you say like what do you think or whatever?

2271
02:51:50.86 --> 02:51:53.66
You know, I'm like all right. Yeah, we're gonna record that and

2272
02:51:53.66 --> 02:52:00.70
And these jockel tracks they have it for anything not just skipping workouts for procrastination getting up early all this stuff

2273
02:52:00.70 --> 02:52:02.22
So it's kind of like

2274
02:52:02.22 --> 02:52:07.66
Even if your volumes not turned up. It's kind of like jockel's actually telling you like how does not skip the workout?

2275
02:52:07.98 --> 02:52:11.10
It's good. It's encouragement. Yeah, yeah

2276
02:52:11.10 --> 02:52:16.50
Yeah, I was going to be as happen people always like oh, you should make a thing of you yelling at me to get out of bed

2277
02:52:16.66 --> 02:52:18.30
Yeah, you know

2278
02:52:18.30 --> 02:52:24.30
I'm not the thing that would work but it would only work like a few times after while it's kind of like

2279
02:52:24.30 --> 02:52:26.42
You know, you know, it's like cool

2280
02:52:26.42 --> 02:52:30.78
Shut up according to jockel yelling, but if you're you know how like you're talking like you know

2281
02:52:30.78 --> 02:52:32.54
You know, it's like it's kind of like you're explained

2282
02:52:32.54 --> 02:52:35.42
Practically you know like this is this what's going on this?

2283
02:52:35.42 --> 02:52:39.14
Which kind of thing. It's enough of reminder of like hey get back on the path

2284
02:52:39.14 --> 02:52:43.22
Yeah, yeah, there you go, but yeah, good one get that one on

2285
02:52:44.22 --> 02:52:47.22
iTunes but basically anywhere where they sell in people

2286
02:52:47.22 --> 02:52:49.22
Yeah, yeah, it's available

2287
02:52:49.22 --> 02:52:57.82
Cool, I'm pretty surprised. It was the porch the also when you're on Amazon you can get jockel white tea now the good thing about there's some good things and bad things about jockel white tea

2288
02:52:58.30 --> 02:53:03.86
The bad things or is you got to mix it up with hot water that can take a little extra time the good things is

2289
02:53:04.98 --> 02:53:10.98
Once you drink about a half a cup of white tea and this is what we're finding now when you drink about a half a cup of white tea

2290
02:53:10.98 --> 02:53:17.18
You are then able to deadlift 8000 pounds a lot of people wondering how much you had to drink and they answer

2291
02:53:17.18 --> 02:53:23.06
You can drink a half a cup and you're there. So you can get jockel white team and it's also legal

2292
02:53:24.14 --> 02:53:29.18
Which a lot of people are trying to get it out loud right now by the you know the athletic commission and the Olympics

2293
02:53:29.18 --> 02:53:30.18
They don't want people

2294
02:53:30.18 --> 02:53:37.02
Break out of records and everything so yeah, they're trying to just ban it, but get it while you can right get it while you can before it gets banned

2295
02:53:37.82 --> 02:53:41.38
Before it gets banned and then you're just done also some books

2296
02:53:41.38 --> 02:53:48.74
The books that I read on the podcast for sure. There's also book called a lot of the books that read the podcast are for adults clearly

2297
02:53:48.94 --> 02:53:51.10
a lot of them are very you need a mature audience

2298
02:53:51.66 --> 02:53:58.98
But kids also need to know how to get on the path and am I right you got kids kids kids need to know how to get on the path how they're gonna get on path well

2299
02:54:00.26 --> 02:54:02.66
Number one they can get the book way the warrior kid and

2300
02:54:03.86 --> 02:54:09.62
They can get on the path with that and now there's another book coming out. It's way the warrior kid

2301
02:54:09.62 --> 02:54:11.62
Two

2302
02:54:11.62 --> 02:54:15.78
sequel the sequel could it be a jaws to fail

2303
02:54:17.38 --> 02:54:22.10
There's always that chance if I would have listened to my publisher

2304
02:54:23.30 --> 02:54:29.34
Yeah, cuz what do they want to do they want you to turn out? Hey you got a little bit going here

2306
02:54:32.54 --> 02:54:38.02
By the way, let us help you shaping it where we think with this could go. Oh, so you just want to take it down that path

2307
02:54:38.02 --> 02:54:40.02
No, we're not going down that path

2308
02:54:40.26 --> 02:54:41.54
Life's hard

2309
02:54:41.54 --> 02:54:45.38
Mark's gonna face some more struggles and he does

This is gonna help you stay on the path. That's what it's gonna do

2318
02:55:18.66 --> 02:55:23.70
Not only what you should think about in a section called thoughts, but all of the actions you should take if you

2319
02:55:24.34 --> 02:55:27.82
Want to proceed to get stronger

2320
02:55:28.66 --> 02:55:29.70
Faster

2321
02:55:29.70 --> 02:55:35.90
smarter and all around better and if you want the audio version don't look for it on audible because it's not there

2322
02:55:36.66 --> 02:55:38.66
This is an

2323
02:55:38.66 --> 02:55:43.86
Album also with tracks and it's available in MP3 format

2324
02:55:44.34 --> 02:55:49.30
From Amazon music from Google play from other MP3 platforms

2325
02:55:51.70 --> 02:55:54.38
And actually life, let's talk a little bit about

2326
02:55:54.38 --> 02:56:00.02
I don't know a couple books we wrote a little company we got maybe a little event that we're doing

2327
02:56:00.46 --> 02:56:07.02
First of all most if you want a dive deeper in the leadership principles that we've been talking about and referencing getting extreme ownership

2328
02:56:07.10 --> 02:56:10.82
That's we have people ask us like hey, where did you make mistakes in your career?

2329
02:56:10.82 --> 02:56:16.30
We wrote a whole book about them. That's what extreme notions about the mistakes we learn on the battlefield the things that happen to us

2330
02:56:16.30 --> 02:56:21.02
What we learn from them and then how that a principal applies to business in life

2331
02:56:21.02 --> 02:56:27.30
So go get that book on Amazon or anywhere that you can buy books and if you're like me and you're super busy and you don't have a lot of time to read

2332
02:56:28.14 --> 02:56:32.66
Then you can get the audible book the audio book. It's on audible. It's on anywhere and

2333
02:56:33.66 --> 02:56:38.62
Get that version and we read it by the way. We read it James Earl Jones wasn't available

2334
02:56:39.02 --> 02:56:40.14
So

2335
02:56:40.14 --> 02:56:45.80
That's Batman was we we we had to read it. I didn't realize I was the Texas Batman until people were listening to this book

2336
02:56:46.02 --> 02:56:49.54
Yeah, yeah, you are that's where that was born on social media

2337
02:56:49.54 --> 02:56:55.38
I hear good things about the audio version. No, there's a little there's little surprises in the audio version

2338
02:56:55.38 --> 02:57:00.26
That it once again. We didn't listen to our publisher our publisher was like well, that's kind of weird to put that well

2339
02:57:00.26 --> 02:57:03.46
We well, what would you rather hear for gunfire?

2340
02:57:04.18 --> 02:57:07.54
You know me going pop pop pop pop pop pop or would you rather hear gunfire?

2341
02:57:07.54 --> 02:57:09.54
What would you rather hear for an explosion life going?

2342
02:57:10.10 --> 02:57:12.42
Come on or would you rather have an explosion?

2343
02:57:12.98 --> 02:57:15.82
What would you rather have for the call to prayer?

2344
02:57:15.82 --> 02:57:20.38
Life talking about the call to prayer coming because it's you can be pretty eerie in those situations

2345
02:57:20.38 --> 02:57:22.38
Or would you rather actually hear it?

2346
02:57:22.78 --> 02:57:24.78
So this what would you call that?

2347
02:57:25.58 --> 02:57:28.78
Audio theater sure you make it into call that

2348
02:57:29.34 --> 02:57:35.50
Yeah, audio theater okay and they did a great job with that with the audio book so get that that's certainly an option as well

03:00:09.18 --> 03:00:10.78
Which would be done

2383
03:00:10.78 --> 03:00:20.14
for the most part by then awesome obviously thanks for coming on thanks to everyone out there especially those of you who are out there in uniform

2384
03:00:21.26 --> 03:00:24.22
Who have basically said

2385
03:00:25.18 --> 03:00:30.78
I am willing to give everything I have for freedom we're here today because of you

2386
03:00:31.02 --> 03:00:37.98
So thank you. Thank you to the police and the law enforcement and the firefighters and the paramedics and the rest of the first responders

2387
03:00:37.98 --> 03:00:40.78
That do their job

2388
03:00:41.98 --> 03:00:43.58
everyday

2389
03:00:43.58 --> 03:00:53.34
Every day to make sure that we are safe here at home and everyone else out there that's listening and sharing and supporting this podcast

2390
03:00:54.94 --> 03:00:56.46
Thank you

2391
03:00:56.46 --> 03:00:58.06
but

2392
03:00:58.06 --> 03:01:00.06
Don't just listen and

2393
03:01:00.62 --> 03:01:02.62
don't just support and

2394
03:01:03.90 --> 03:01:05.90
Don't just share

2395
03:01:05.90 --> 03:01:07.90
but instead

2396
03:01:09.34 --> 03:01:11.34
Wake up every day with a mission

2397
03:01:13.18 --> 03:01:18.22
Wake up every day with a goal to be a little bit better than you were yesterday

2398
03:01:19.82 --> 03:01:23.90
and become the self-correcting machine

2399
03:01:26.38 --> 03:01:28.06
That's not gonna bring you to perfection

2400
03:01:29.34 --> 03:01:33.18
But it's gonna bring you to a place that's a little bit closer

2401
03:01:33.18 --> 03:01:37.18
to get out there and get after it

2402
03:01:38.06 --> 03:01:42.14
and until next time this is life and echo and jacco

2403
03:01:42.14 --> 03:02:02.14
out
