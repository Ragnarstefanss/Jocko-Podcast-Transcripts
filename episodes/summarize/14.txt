I think mine's like, psychological where, if I know it's 20 minutes, then I'm not, I don't feel like, I don't know, confined or, I don't know, I feel like, I feel like, I don't know. Where I'm just, where I just, for whatever, I lose the bubble, you know, and there's could be anything any number of things that could cause that maybe, you know, it's like multiple, I don't know, bad situation with travel, then with an event, then with something that come home and it's a birthday party and they only think it's pizza and I'm like, you know what it's Oh, and it's just done, right? Those are like the official, like when you, if you go through like a gun course, something like those are, that's the first thing. and then I saw this little kind of like a little ring, you know, like a little tab of skin just appeared. And so, you know, the last, you know, so we start with 20 guys on the mat and then after three rounds, there's, you know, 15 guys or 16 guys on the mat and then it down day 10 and then eight and then four and then it's me and one other guy. And the same way that I will, some nights I go in like there was, some days I go in or nights and, and, you know, normal night I just feel like roll and so I go in and roll. I sort, I feel like I got, I got good training yet, like, six, six, better rounds. Like I saw in his face as soon as I told him that it was like being, it was like connection made. Just like a joke, you know, they say like every joke has some little truth to it. I feel like I just feel like I'm going to break my toe today. And actually, I mean, there's like Tim Ferriss, he's got that thing where he does, it's something like six days in a row of eating, super clean. And then you've got to, you're other opportunities will come because people will see that you develop a team, people will see that you develop good leaders, and they're going to say, hey, I want you to come and do that at this higher position, and you're going to get benefit from that as well. So what is it like kind of like when your coach is saying, okay, everybody push up for 60 seconds and he's looking around and when you see he's not looking at you, you just kind of cruise. You mentioned the, the, given into the brain that you were evolved to have or when you know, and that's like seeking out sugar and fat and, you know, fat's not bad. Like someone's like kind of squeezing my hand a little bit with their fingers. Yeah, well, there's a quote where one guy was asking the other guy or something, like, hey, what happens if we develop our workers, and then they leave us, and he's like, it's better than not developing on. And so we trained a bunch and you know, there's no factor and he's like, well, we're going to tell him and I said, I haven't eaten for 48 hours. And then there's some from like, you know what, I do not want to do that kind of workout today because I feel an impending injury. Most of the time guys are, you know, like, hey, man, are you okay? It was like kind of touching it or something like that, but it's with us weird right? And I used to tell that to MMA fighters too and I've told that story before you know listen guys you're getting worried they're going to get knocked out or they're going to get caught in a submission. Like, oh, and instructors coming, like they'll help people skate through. Like, one way or the other, like, I either busted my ass and it did a couple days of hard working out. I'm like, looks like it's you got the last round, my friend. And I'll tell you one thing that I do, I kind of see is you know when I'm in the movie the Terminator when he sees like the various responses he could give. And I remember like they were telling me, hey, you know, sometimes guys get wounded, big shot and it does, it does, it does, it does not phase them. Where if you show anger, not only is it like a powerful thing in there, you're like, oh shoot, this is powerful.
