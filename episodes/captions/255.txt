00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.48 This is Jockelpontcast number 255.
00:00:04.48 --> 00:00:07.04 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.04 Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:09.04 Good evening.
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:12.48 And joining us again is Dave Burke.
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:13.48 Good evening, Dave.
00:00:13.48 --> 00:00:14.48 Good evening.
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:21.48 So we go on with guidelines for the leader and commander.
00:00:21.48 --> 00:00:29.000 And I think at this point, I'm not even sure that I'm just doing this purely out of my own joy.
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.12 Having searched for this book for more than a decade, finally found a copy.
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:41.12 And now I'm making everyone else enjoy it with me.
00:00:41.12 --> 00:00:47.76 We covered this book on 251, 252, 253, 254.
00:00:47.76 --> 00:00:48.76 But there's a reason.
00:00:48.76 --> 00:00:56.16 There's a reason to dig through the past two R roots, two My roots.
00:00:56.16 --> 00:01:01.64 The roots from this book, from a man that served in World War I, World War II, Korea, General
00:01:01.64 --> 00:01:07.16 Pruskark, Bruce Clark, who then overlap that service in Korea with Colonel David Hackworth
00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:11.84 who served in Korea and in Vietnam and who wrote the book about face.
00:01:11.84 --> 00:01:16.72 These are the lessons that I learned that I tried to pass on.
00:01:16.72 --> 00:01:19.76 And the DNA is so clear.
00:01:19.76 --> 00:01:25.24 It's so clear to read this book.
00:01:25.24 --> 00:01:34.08 And see that DNA to find the roots of knowledge and knowing it, we learn more.
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:36.000 And that's the goal.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.36 The goal is to learn and improve and get better.
00:01:40.36 --> 00:01:46.16 So guidelines for the leader and commander by General Bruce Clark.
00:01:46.16 --> 00:01:48.08 Here we go.
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:49.68 Back to the book.
00:01:49.68 --> 00:01:52.20 This next section, and I'll be honest with you.
00:01:52.20 --> 00:01:54.80 The last section, I liked it.
00:01:54.80 --> 00:01:58.52 There's some lessons that some takeaways for sure.
00:01:58.52 --> 00:01:59.60 This one I started getting.
00:01:59.60 --> 00:02:03.40 This one I had a good time with.
00:02:03.40 --> 00:02:07.56 And I was a little worried at first because the last section we were talking about was
00:02:07.56 --> 00:02:11.48 what's talking about training the individual soldier, which to me is like, okay, this
00:02:11.48 --> 00:02:12.48 what we're doing.
00:02:12.48 --> 00:02:13.96 We're talking about the individual soldier.
00:02:13.96 --> 00:02:19.40 I thought that might have been a little bit of a peak, a little bit of a peak where I started
00:02:19.40 --> 00:02:20.40 like this.
00:02:20.40 --> 00:02:23.88 But then I got to this section chapter 10, which is called training the unit.
00:02:23.88 --> 00:02:28.64 And I started saying, okay, which makes sense, right?
00:02:28.64 --> 00:02:30.72 Which makes sense.
00:02:30.72 --> 00:02:32.40 Because certainly there's going to be parallels.
00:02:32.40 --> 00:02:35.76 When you talk about training individual soldiers, but when you start talking about training
00:02:35.76 --> 00:02:41.96 teams and training units, this is where things really start to come to light from a leadership
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:42.96 perspective.
00:02:42.96 --> 00:02:45.72 So important of unit training.
00:02:45.72 --> 00:02:50.32 The army's investment in the soldier pays off only when the unit is combat ready.
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:55.60 So training develops combat ready units by welding skills, skilled individuals in the teams
00:02:55.60 --> 00:03:01.04 and combining teams into effective for tunes, companies and combined arms forces.
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:05.80 It is my purpose in this chapter to highlight the application of principles and techniques
00:03:05.80 --> 00:03:10.84 that will contribute to improving a unit's combat readiness in less time at less cost, thus
00:03:10.84 --> 00:03:17.60 enabling the army to realize full measure from its investment in the soldier and as unit.
00:03:17.60 --> 00:03:18.84 So there you go.
00:03:18.84 --> 00:03:22.84 This is about training that team, getting them to work together.
00:03:22.84 --> 00:03:25.28 Theme of unit combat readiness.
00:03:25.28 --> 00:03:31.80 It has often been said that battles are fought by squads and platoons and one by teamwork
00:03:31.80 --> 00:03:37.84 of small units supported by fire.
00:03:37.84 --> 00:03:41.60 Combat power is inflicted on the enemy by fire and movement.
00:03:41.60 --> 00:03:42.60 There you go.
00:03:42.60 --> 00:03:43.60 Cover move.
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:44.60 Welcome.
00:03:44.60 --> 00:03:47.48 It's been three paragraphs we're talking about.
00:03:47.48 --> 00:03:48.80 Cover move.
00:03:48.80 --> 00:03:53.92 This is why I started getting fired up.
00:03:53.92 --> 00:03:59.32 The purpose of movement is to get the fire in the most advantageous position to destroy
00:03:59.32 --> 00:04:00.32 the enemy.
00:04:00.32 --> 00:04:03.88 That's a good little thing to think about.
00:04:03.88 --> 00:04:06.04 That's why we cover and move.
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:10.36 We cover and move to close with and destroy the enemy to get in an advantageous position to
00:04:10.36 --> 00:04:11.36 destroy the enemy.
00:04:11.36 --> 00:04:12.80 That's why we cover and move.
00:04:12.80 --> 00:04:16.60 One must remember however that gasoline, ammunition and other vital supplies are needed to
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:18.60 sustain tactical operations.
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:23.44 Accordingly, emphasis on small unit training should habitually stress teamwork to the
00:04:23.44 --> 00:04:28.72 point that tactical execution is accomplished with the same precision as dismounted drill
00:04:28.72 --> 00:04:34.12 that delivery of effective fire is as automatic as gun drill and that's supplied to the
00:04:34.12 --> 00:04:39.52 tactical unit is as responsive in battle as it is in Garrison.
00:04:39.52 --> 00:04:45.28 These battlefield reflections vividly point out the basic theme of small unit combat readiness.
00:04:45.28 --> 00:04:49.52 No small unit training should be undertaken in a vacuum.
00:04:49.52 --> 00:04:50.72 Why is he pointing this out?
00:04:50.72 --> 00:04:56.60 He's pointing this out because in the military it's very easy to silo yourself.
00:04:56.60 --> 00:05:00.04 It's very easy to say I want my platoon to be good so I'm going to go train my platoon.
00:05:00.04 --> 00:05:02.68 I want my company be good so I'm going to train my company.
00:05:02.68 --> 00:05:05.72 I want my battalion to be good so I'm just going to go train my battalion over here in
00:05:05.72 --> 00:05:07.12 a vacuum.
00:05:07.12 --> 00:05:11.08 If you're doing that you're wrong in any organization.
00:05:11.08 --> 00:05:15.84 If you're a sales person and you're not training alongside the operations people to make
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:21.28 sure that you know how to communicate to them what you want and they know how to communicate
00:05:21.28 --> 00:05:24.72 to you what they can deliver.
00:05:24.72 --> 00:05:25.92 What about the IT group?
00:05:25.92 --> 00:05:29.24 Do they understand how to handle the threshold of emails that you're going to be getting?
00:05:29.24 --> 00:05:36.20 When you offer this new practice, all these things that need you need to work together.
00:05:36.20 --> 00:05:41.16 Sometimes it's because of internal competition as well.
00:05:41.16 --> 00:05:43.20 Wait that's why we wouldn't train together.
00:05:43.20 --> 00:05:51.48 Maybe or maybe but I think it's just like the straight up silos.
00:05:51.48 --> 00:05:52.48 You know what I'm saying?
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:55.04 The straight up like hey this is my platoon I'm going to take care of my platoon.
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:56.64 This is my division I'm going to take care of my platoon.
00:05:56.64 --> 00:05:58.48 This is my department I'm going to take care of my department.
00:05:58.48 --> 00:06:03.40 So like you're not thinking about necessarily the other guys or you're just like
00:06:03.40 --> 00:06:06.68 me and leave me alone.
00:06:06.68 --> 00:06:12.32 I think it could be either a real negative attitude but it could also be just a positive
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:14.44 attitude that's like hey I'm going to train my platoon.
00:06:14.44 --> 00:06:15.44 That's what you're focused on.
00:06:15.44 --> 00:06:16.96 Yeah I'm going to train my platoon.
00:06:16.96 --> 00:06:18.44 Come here I'm going to train my platoon.
00:06:18.44 --> 00:06:20.16 We are going to be ready.
00:06:20.16 --> 00:06:23.80 Here's the problem you can be ready but if you can't call for fire correctly it doesn't
00:06:23.80 --> 00:06:27.48 matter if you've never coordinated with a QRF before it doesn't matter when that
00:06:27.48 --> 00:06:31.48 QRF is needed you don't know what you're doing.
00:06:31.48 --> 00:06:33.36 It happens in business too.
00:06:33.36 --> 00:06:37.16 Hey you know we're like I said we're the sales team.
00:06:37.16 --> 00:06:44.56 We don't care I'm not going to I don't need to train the the customer satisfaction group
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:47.80 I don't need to train with them that's not my deal right.
00:06:47.80 --> 00:06:51.40 I don't care what happens when you know once I sell the product I don't care what happens
00:06:51.40 --> 00:06:57.48 oh really you should care what happens because if the client calls customer satisfaction
00:06:57.48 --> 00:07:00.20 it looks for a solution to a problem that they've got is they're implementing the thing
00:07:00.20 --> 00:07:04.32 that you just sold them and the solution isn't there guess what you're not getting good
00:07:04.32 --> 00:07:08.32 reviews and you're not going to sell anymore product to that company.
00:07:08.32 --> 00:07:12.32 Is the name customer satisfaction department is that it?
00:07:12.32 --> 00:07:13.32 Yeah yeah.
00:07:13.32 --> 00:07:17.20 Yeah we're sometimes they call it client implementation there's many many organizations
00:07:17.20 --> 00:07:20.96 that are set up in such a way that there's someone that sells the product and then there's
00:07:20.96 --> 00:07:24.68 someone that helps them implement the product and that's customer satisfaction.
00:07:24.68 --> 00:07:28.08 Could be customer satisfaction client satisfaction for some other names for a day if
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:32.04 you can you think of any customer service tech support yeah stuff like that tech support
00:07:32.04 --> 00:07:37.000 that's a good one tech support you might think of like that's a broad based like hey I've
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.20 had this computer for two years and now it's not working.
00:07:41.20 --> 00:07:47.28 What's all I'm talking about companies where you buy a new system of software for your
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:50.64 organization like a solar panel.
00:07:50.64 --> 00:07:55.40 I guess home by a solar panel for your roof.
00:07:55.40 --> 00:08:00.64 Well let's say let's say you did that maybe you buy solar panels for your roof right
00:08:00.64 --> 00:08:04.20 and then great you're the salesman you sell them to me guess what you're done when you're
00:08:04.20 --> 00:08:07.80 done selling me my solar panels you're on trying to sell the next pair.
00:08:07.80 --> 00:08:13.92 So when I call because the installation I'm having a hard time with I call customer satisfaction
00:08:13.92 --> 00:08:19.08 it's Dave Dave picks up the phone hey I just ordered this thing and now he says well
00:08:19.08 --> 00:08:22.40 how many you know and I say look we're having trouble installing this it doesn't fit
00:08:22.40 --> 00:08:29.28 on my roof right and you say okay well how many panels did you get and what size are
00:08:29.28 --> 00:08:35.80 they and all of a sudden he realizes that he needs to give you feedback that listen if the
00:08:35.80 --> 00:08:41.12 roof is this angle fits a different way and so now you can sell the product better and
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:45.48 that will keep people more satisfied you can also do a follow-up called me and say hey
00:08:45.48 --> 00:08:50.12 hey sir I'm really sorry when I measured your roof I thought it was this angle and so
00:08:50.12 --> 00:08:53.32 I I I told you this thing here's what we're gonna do we're actually to come out and pick
00:08:53.32 --> 00:08:57.68 up three of the panels that you're not gonna need anymore and I'm gonna you know I'm gonna
00:08:57.68 --> 00:09:02.20 give you a 10% rebate and we're also sending an installer out there to give you a hand
00:09:02.20 --> 00:09:06.12 and boom right now I'm taking care of we're all happy now we guess what I'm doing when somebody
00:09:06.12 --> 00:09:11.40 asked me oh you got solar panels what company and I say oh echoes solar panels is it a
00:09:11.40 --> 00:09:14.64 good company yeah you know it was a little rough but they got everything taken care of
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:18.20 you should definitely call them you see what I'm going with us yeah fully in the
00:09:18.20 --> 00:09:23.08 world you just took me down the rabbit hole solar installation that was good
00:09:23.08 --> 00:09:27.76 maybe not the best example but you did good I'm over here to run with it yeah yeah
00:09:27.76 --> 00:09:30.48 yeah that's good we're here to make it happen what do you got but yeah because I
00:09:30.48 --> 00:09:35.60 you don't really think about that when you're at work you know where you kind of
00:09:35.60 --> 00:09:40.80 want to be the best worker in company sure you know but the customer like experience
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:44.20 is kind of the whole deal you know you know how like man when you leave your review
00:09:44.20 --> 00:09:48.28 you're like great product bad customer service and that can be like well that sucks
00:09:48.28 --> 00:09:51.80 because I need some customer service kind of thing so it's kind of a downer you know
00:09:51.80 --> 00:09:54.84 yeah because we're not thinking everything's going to work perfect every single time right
00:09:54.84 --> 00:09:58.68 I'm not necessarily you seem to say but I'm saying like you know you have these elements
00:09:58.68 --> 00:10:05.72 of a product or service that are all to the customer it's like it's all the same thing
00:10:05.72 --> 00:10:09.88 I'm not going to go to this person just for one thing I'm going to go I mean as far as
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:14.84 one quality of their product they're going to they'll get turned off by other
00:10:14.84 --> 00:10:19.72 departments so if you work there for your just focus on yours rather that affects you
00:10:19.72 --> 00:10:24.60 that's what general car is saying you have to interact with other people inside
00:10:24.60 --> 00:10:31.000 your organization and if you're not doing that you're wrong you're wrong fast forward a
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.92 little training philosophy the basic the basic philosophy of successful training is
00:10:34.92 --> 00:10:40.36 that of obtaining superior results with average personnel god I love that
00:10:41.24 --> 00:10:46.60 with a reason or training is to take average people and make them exceptional superior results
00:10:46.60 --> 00:10:52.68 a unit to be truly outstanding should be excellent in all undertakings and activities
00:10:52.68 --> 00:10:56.76 commanders must know and understand that capabilities and limitations of personnel
00:10:56.76 --> 00:11:02.52 and set high and exacting standards of capabilities of the high ability of a group of
00:11:02.52 --> 00:11:08.12 units personnel this tends to give the low ability group a hopeless feeling because of
00:11:08.12 --> 00:11:14.36 having to compete against a standard which they cannot attain a unit satisfactory and all things
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:21.96 is better than one outstanding in some excellent in others and unsatisfactory in a few
00:11:23.24 --> 00:11:31.08 that's a good thing to think about you know it's better to be good at a bunch I
00:11:31.08 --> 00:11:36.36 good at everything then outstanding at this one thing okay it's some other things in unsack
00:11:36.36 --> 00:11:38.36 in some final things
00:11:41.24 --> 00:11:46.52 next section fast forward a little bit emphasize fundamentals the basic difference between
00:11:46.52 --> 00:11:50.92 well trained unit and one that is not well trained is found in the attention paid to the
00:11:50.92 --> 00:11:55.56 fundamentals of marksmanship chemical biological and radiological warfare communications
00:11:55.56 --> 00:11:59.16 maintenance administration in all other arts and skills that contribute to making the unit
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:04.52 combat ready in the shortest possible time a well trained soldier is the only foundation upon
00:12:04.52 --> 00:12:08.36 which effective combat ready units can be built when the soldier fails to demonstrate
00:12:08.36 --> 00:12:14.52 proficiency in individual skills the army's investment is wasted and the combat readiness of the
00:12:14.52 --> 00:12:21.64 unit is diminished each commander should approach his problems of combat readiness with a sense of
00:12:21.64 --> 00:12:31.24 wartime urgency there is no magic formula no sweatless solution to achieving a high state
00:12:31.24 --> 00:12:36.76 of combat readiness in a unit application the fundamentals enumerated below however will help
00:12:36.76 --> 00:12:42.76 so that by the way sweatless solution you've heard that before right that's that's that's hack
00:12:42.76 --> 00:12:49.16 well hack took that actual phrase and I was I had tried to find it in about face and of course
00:12:49.16 --> 00:12:53.88 that about faces 836 pages and I was like oh I know it's in here somewhere after I've
00:12:53.88 --> 00:12:58.28 I've done it on the podcast I've talked about the sweatless solution there is no sweatless solution
00:12:58.28 --> 00:13:02.76 we've covered that on the podcast you may have wondered where he got I was thought he made it up right
00:13:02.76 --> 00:13:07.56 of course we thought he made it up if you ever heard me say it maybe thought I made it up I didn't
00:13:07.56 --> 00:13:13.000 make it up neither do the hack there you go I believe the source is general clerk
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.20 sweatless solution that's like that's that stuck with me for a long time still is with me really
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:25.16 because sweat in part of it is yes because I had to admit to myself brother to me a lot of the time
00:13:25.16 --> 00:13:31.32 I'm looking for that sweatless this faith in the space I've been if you can go and get like
00:13:31.32 --> 00:13:38.12 you know the kind where okay the other day echo Charles going deep standby
00:13:38.12 --> 00:13:47.64 get some so I'm sitting on the couch right in big shocker there's a there's a so the remote control
00:13:47.64 --> 00:13:51.000 I have the kind where you know like the remote control for the cable and then for the volume
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000 they're two different okay so I got the one for the cable but I was like the volume one is
00:13:59.40 --> 00:14:05.16 like the volume one is somewhere else you know the kind you're looking around has to be close to you
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:08.52 right because it's not like it's you know in the next room or something like that's not it
00:14:08.52 --> 00:14:13.24 doesn't have it's not gonna go far it's but it's around here somewhere right this is what we train for
00:14:13.24 --> 00:14:21.64 bro talking about this is a loose there so you know you kind of look around your little vicinity
00:14:21.64 --> 00:14:26.68 or whatever I'm not getting up though bro I'm already sitting down that might cause me to sweat a
00:14:26.68 --> 00:14:31.24 little bit but whatever so I'm looking around and I turn around and we have this ledge like behind
00:14:31.24 --> 00:14:37.56 the couch they're you know that ledge there and I look and it's behind me but it's the kind
00:14:37.56 --> 00:14:42.76 of incident this weird spot where I can't like I gotta stand up just if I want to stood up
00:14:42.76 --> 00:14:46.60 when I first saw it but I would have had the remote control enjoying some television at this
00:14:46.60 --> 00:14:51.88 point but I'm like trying to contort my body like all weird it was weird it was almost like I was
00:14:51.88 --> 00:14:59.08 putting more effort into my sweatless solution then actual energy would have been expanded if I went
00:14:59.08 --> 00:15:05.64 for the sweat solution the real one you know put it in just stand up for a second you know but I'm saying
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:17.32 okay so the point the point the point the point is the point is bro I'm talking about hack or
00:15:17.32 --> 00:15:21.56 I'm talking about general Clark he served in World War World War 2 Korea and the
00:15:21.56 --> 00:15:29.80 current was a non-most decorated soldier you couldn't get your remote I could one I'm saying is
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:38.20 sometimes we ask the people sometimes we put so much effort into looking for a sweatless solution
00:15:38.20 --> 00:15:45.96 okay seems like as a philosophy you know and how general Clark is saying subsequently hack
00:15:45.96 --> 00:15:51.96 worse subsequently Choco whether they're saying stop looking for the sweatless solution stop like straight up
00:15:52.68 --> 00:15:57.48 but just do the work stand up get through the remote control
00:15:57.48 --> 00:16:06.68 whatever this may be the apex of the echo Charles examples of just saying there's a lot of those
00:16:06.68 --> 00:16:10.44 you look like when you're vacuuming and you see the little thing it doesn't want to get sucked up by
00:16:10.44 --> 00:16:15.80 the vacuum just been no picking up you should and I don't want to do that so you're like
00:16:15.80 --> 00:16:21.24 kick it to try to get it loose you whatever I'm just saying these lessons are kind of everywhere
00:16:21.24 --> 00:16:29.64 when you think of it you don't say alright man general Clark would agree I mean I know he definitely
00:16:29.64 --> 00:16:36.04 would when he wasn't like on the line yeah of course fighting the Nazis yeah or fighting the
00:16:36.04 --> 00:16:43.40 communists yeah these guys didn't even have remote controls bro yeah excuse more counterice
00:16:43.40 --> 00:16:48.68 for I will be just trying to understand alright well there you go alright so back to the book
00:16:51.24 --> 00:16:55.72 he's talking about the things that you can you can do to keep a unit trained up number one
00:16:55.72 --> 00:17:00.28 do essential things first there's not enough time for the commander to do everything
00:17:00.28 --> 00:17:04.04 each commander will have to determine wisely what is essential and a sign response abilities for
00:17:04.04 --> 00:17:09.08 accomplishment he should spend the remaining time on near essentials this is especially true of
00:17:09.08 --> 00:17:14.76 training not essential should not take up required time required for essentials what do we call that
00:17:15.48 --> 00:17:22.60 we call that prioritize next year next thing do things right the first time
00:17:23.64 --> 00:17:29.16 the commander should not consider his unit ready for battle until it can carry out a plan well the first
00:17:29.16 --> 00:17:34.52 time to often commanders hold rehearsals of things their unit should be able to do well without
00:17:34.52 --> 00:17:40.68 rehearsal I like this because this is like a little bit you know there's this mantra in the
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:46.52 games about you should do one foot one third planning one third gear prep one third rehearsal we
00:17:46.52 --> 00:17:51.32 put all this emphasis in the rehearsal which is awesome and I 100% believe that but you should
00:17:51.32 --> 00:17:55.000 there's things that you shouldn't have to rehearse right and that's what he said or something
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.44 he just just know should have some some standard operating positions that you should know
00:17:59.56 --> 00:18:04.04 look are we gonna rehearse some yes we are but you should know you shouldn't need you should
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:08.68 rehearse him you shouldn't have to rehearse but you should rehearse I rehearse everything
00:18:11.24 --> 00:18:17.40 this practice causes officers and men expecting a dry run or two to pay little attention to
00:18:17.40 --> 00:18:23.40 initial instructions and to make inadequate preparations there will be no dry runs in combat
00:18:25.96 --> 00:18:30.84 it is good to issue adequate instructions and hold officers and men to them the first time
00:18:30.84 --> 00:18:36.44 that's something that I wish I would have learned imagine saying hey look hey look I'm going to tell
00:18:36.44 --> 00:18:41.88 you guys this one time there we're going to go execute no rehearsals just to see just to just
00:18:41.88 --> 00:18:47.96 to get people in the mindset of paying attention and figuring out where your directions and your
00:18:47.96 --> 00:18:53.64 planning is a short fall because if I can't say okay Dave here's what we're going to do you're
00:18:53.64 --> 00:18:56.04 going to go in this building I'm going to go in this building you're going to take your squad
00:18:56.04 --> 00:18:58.84 you're going to move to here you're going to move to there does everyone understand all right we're
00:18:58.84 --> 00:19:06.44 going to go do it right now in this training exercise with no rehearsals that will show us the short
00:19:06.44 --> 00:19:13.000 falls of our planning and our communication it will also show the team short falls and when they
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.84 don't know what to do they should raise their hand and say hey boss that doesn't make sense to me
00:19:16.84 --> 00:19:20.92 right now hold on a second let me hear that again I don't understand that part
00:19:20.92 --> 00:19:31.000 practice more than one thing at a time okay so wait a second are we going against prioritize
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000 next cue does that what's happening no actually whenever I see a unit practicing only one thing
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.92 at a time I'd remember of the history paper my son brought home one day the grammar construction
00:19:40.92 --> 00:19:46.28 and spelling were not good this is very poor English I told him but daddy said I was only being tested
00:19:46.28 --> 00:19:52.44 in history sound training requires that many subjects be skillfully integrated and taught
00:19:52.44 --> 00:20:00.12 concurrently this is an excellent time saver in training and he goes through this and any what he's
00:20:00.12 --> 00:20:04.52 saying is look you gotta do multiple things at the same time and even though prioritize an
00:20:04.52 --> 00:20:09.24 execute when you got multiple problems and you can't try and solve them all at the same time that
00:20:09.24 --> 00:20:17.96 doesn't mean that you're gonna say hold on a second we need to move towards the target but we also
00:20:17.96 --> 00:20:23.000 need to make communications we can only do one at a time no there's things that you have to do concurrently
00:20:24.44 --> 00:20:30.28 and that can include hey we've got to move wounded people and we've got to fight a firefight if we
00:20:30.28 --> 00:20:36.28 only ever practice just getting in a firefight and just moving people how do we know how to do
00:20:36.28 --> 00:20:41.000 both those things at the same time which you may have to do so do you have to prioritize next
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.40 you yes you do but guess what you also have to learn how to do things concurrently
00:20:49.72 --> 00:20:54.52 he says a paper integration and training schedule is not efficient so just like talking about
00:20:54.52 --> 00:20:58.76 it well you know if we have to do move a wounded guy while we're in a firefight well then
00:21:00.04 --> 00:21:06.12 we'll just do this xyz no you have to try it which is contradictory to rehearsals right
00:21:06.12 --> 00:21:14.12 no don't don't don't do rehearsals yes do rehearsals a commander should take every opportunity to
00:21:14.12 --> 00:21:18.60 exploit the effects of integrated training it is the key to accelerate intensified unit combat
00:21:18.60 --> 00:21:24.04 training in effect it increases the amount of available training time good eliminate the habit
00:21:24.04 --> 00:21:29.72 eliminate the administrative habit in training I'm convinced that all commanders should take maximum
00:21:29.72 --> 00:21:35.000 advantage of field training time to develop correct tactical practices and procedures we talked
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.80 about that one last time practice dispersion concealment and can of camouflage the penalty for bad
00:21:41.80 --> 00:21:47.40 habits and passive measures in air defense or warrants special mentioned the day when American
00:21:47.40 --> 00:21:55.24 soldier could be relaxed about dispersion concealment and camouflage is in the past so how does this
00:21:55.24 --> 00:22:03.56 apply to everyday life and business train how you fight train how you fight know the status of
00:22:03.56 --> 00:22:12.92 men and equipment check up on those that are absentee from training practice maintenance in the field
00:22:12.92 --> 00:22:17.56 practice and he's got little sections about these each one of these practice sound troop leading
00:22:17.56 --> 00:22:23.16 procedures the subject of troop leading procedures and allied techniques requires increased emphasis
00:22:23.16 --> 00:22:29.40 on tactical exercises fundamentals found in field manuals and related publications are worthy of stress
00:22:29.40 --> 00:22:35.88 sound command procedures diligently practiced in all field training will form good habits in the unit
00:22:35.88 --> 00:22:45.40 commander form the checklist habit meticulous planning and reconnaissance are required to make sure
00:22:45.40 --> 00:22:50.60 that every minute in the field will be expanded profitably check this for this purpose are
00:22:50.60 --> 00:22:56.52 necessary command and staff tool just as they are for supervising and testing the conduct of training
00:22:56.52 --> 00:23:02.92 what do you got I got the same thing I keep thinking about every time I hear what he has to say he he keeps
00:23:02.92 --> 00:23:10.36 repeating fundamental sound realistic fundamentals these are the fundamental to the basic things all
00:23:10.36 --> 00:23:17.56 the basic things associated with their job and being good at those things and training in a real
00:23:17.56 --> 00:23:27.40 asexinereo there's a lot obviously general carcass talking about war he's recounting his experiences
00:23:27.40 --> 00:23:34.20 war I hear what he's saying is connecting it to war but the the application of these things as I keep
00:23:34.20 --> 00:23:37.88 hearing it in my head hearing what you're saying and thinking about the things I'm thinking about now
00:23:38.76 --> 00:23:44.68 if you are in the private sector anywhere the private sector unless you happen to be
00:23:44.68 --> 00:23:51.16 in one of the rare sectors that's not competitive and there are almost none if you are in the
00:23:51.16 --> 00:23:58.28 if you are in the American capitalist private sector you are at war your competitors
00:23:59.24 --> 00:24:04.44 don't want to share space with you they don't want to cooperate with you to to work in harmony
00:24:04.44 --> 00:24:09.88 to they want to run you over they want to take all of your clients all of your market share
00:24:09.88 --> 00:24:14.60 and all of your product they want to take all that from you and the way you are successful is the
00:24:14.60 --> 00:24:19.40 exact same things your people have to be trained on the fundamentals and everything that applies to
00:24:19.40 --> 00:24:24.36 them and the only way to do that is to find a way to train them realistically that replicates what
00:24:24.36 --> 00:24:30.12 they're going to deal with in the real war in their real world it's just kind of crazy how
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:37.16 while it seems difficult to make the connection to his world the connection is so straightforward
00:24:37.16 --> 00:24:43.96 to any world that you're operating in you know I've broached this subject before and I'm sure
00:24:43.96 --> 00:24:53.64 there's got to be some kind of scientific or psychological experiment or whatever but the
00:24:55.32 --> 00:25:05.000 the improvement of your response from a time when you don't know what's going to happen and you
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.64 haven't practiced it to a time when you do know what's going to happen you have practiced it
00:25:09.64 --> 00:25:14.76 is exponential is absolutely exponential and we see this all the time and that's not
00:25:14.76 --> 00:25:18.36 front when we roll play with people totally we put up someone in a role playing scenario
00:25:18.36 --> 00:25:22.84 and and they say we know I've got to go talk to this I'm going to talk to my subordinate leader who's
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:29.32 got a giant ego and okay roll in there and just talk to him see how that goes it's going to be a
00:25:29.32 --> 00:25:34.52 disaster so you roll play and guess what the first time you roll play it's a disaster the second time
00:25:34.52 --> 00:25:39.88 it's 10 times better yeah and then the third time it's 15 times better and then the fourth time
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:46.84 it's 17 times better but that first look that first look that you get when you know a little bit of
00:25:46.84 --> 00:25:54.68 what to expect man you are just you're you're exponentially more prepared for that situation
00:25:54.68 --> 00:25:59.72 and and we know when you're in a leadership position you're going to roll into a meeting where you've
00:25:59.72 --> 00:26:04.12 got to deliver some bad news to the troops you know what they're going to say you know there's
00:26:04.12 --> 00:26:10.04 eight responses you're going to get why not think through those things why not think through those things
00:26:10.04 --> 00:26:13.64 you're going to talk to a client that you've disappointed you've let down you've made a mistake
00:26:13.64 --> 00:26:20.12 you know they're going to have one of six different reactions why not work through those why not
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:25.16 have a contingency plan for each one of those six things this will take you four minutes to do
00:26:25.16 --> 00:26:30.52 it'll take you and I four minutes to roll play may it'll take us five ten minutes to roll play
00:26:30.52 --> 00:26:35.88 the six different responses when I roll into you and I say hey Dave listen I know we promised you
00:26:35.88 --> 00:26:41.56 this product on this date we ran into some hiccups here's the mistakes that I made here's what
00:26:41.56 --> 00:26:45.40 we're going to try and do to resolve it you're only going to be able to say so many different
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:50.52 things back to me and and depending on how I respond I could either salvage that relationship or
00:26:50.52 --> 00:26:56.36 I could destroy it so why would we not train to be prepared for this there's no reason there's no
00:26:56.36 --> 00:27:02.28 excuse for it it doesn't take a week to train for that situation takes ten minutes it does it takes
00:27:02.28 --> 00:27:09.56 ten minutes if your own brain is the only place where you consider the potential outcomes of that
00:27:09.56 --> 00:27:15.32 conversation you're going to miss so many things if I get one other person sit across for me
00:27:15.96 --> 00:27:23.32 to answer in any way that they want how I'm going to interact with them I actually now a reveal
00:27:23.32 --> 00:27:27.24 the well I didn't expect that I didn't see that coming I don't know what to say here
00:27:27.88 --> 00:27:32.84 and you also have to have the other person to just interact with you in a way that helps you anticipate
00:27:33.64 --> 00:27:39.96 a real response that you won't consider if you do it in your own brain which is a vacuum
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:43.16 because what you can convince yourself is oh this isn't going to be that hard of a conversation I'm
00:27:43.16 --> 00:27:47.48 just going to say this he's going to say that and everything's going to be fine the role play
00:27:47.48 --> 00:27:54.20 winners we do to just to add one more thing to that when we do role play it usually comes right
00:27:54.20 --> 00:28:00.84 after we've done the initial training where we explain it he's and he talked about this that is
00:28:00.84 --> 00:28:05.72 that is paper training hey this is what we're going to do and it makes sense we think we understand
00:28:05.72 --> 00:28:10.60 it in our heads it resonates and we can explain these principles and we say okay let's roll
00:28:10.60 --> 00:28:17.32 model this the first role role play the first role play is always a disaster even when we just talked
00:28:17.32 --> 00:28:26.04 about it because on paper isn't enough it's not enough and three role plays later five minutes
00:28:26.04 --> 00:28:31.48 later they've gone from here to way up here and then they can actually go have that conversation
00:28:31.48 --> 00:28:36.68 in real life in real time with the real person that need to talk to you that five minutes of live
00:28:36.68 --> 00:28:45.000 realistic fundamental training is the difference this brings up another topic so I said hey look this
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.80 this individual is only got to have six different responses right there's a seventh and the seventh
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:57.24 is one that you didn't predict you didn't understand and you didn't think could come and guess what you can
00:28:57.24 --> 00:29:01.64 actually train your response for the thing that you just came that came completely out of left
00:29:01.64 --> 00:29:08.68 field and it might be as simple as when Dave if Dave says something to me that I had no anticipation
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:12.44 and it doesn't make any sense to me what am I going to do you know what I'm going to do?
00:29:12.44 --> 00:29:17.80 I'm going to say if Dave says to me well I'll tell you what not only do we want our money back
00:29:17.80 --> 00:29:22.84 I want to I want to take you guys to court I didn't expect him to say that our relationship was not
00:29:22.84 --> 00:29:30.12 bad and I you know my response to him if I don't know what else to say I'm going to say
00:29:30.12 --> 00:29:35.80 Dave you know what I need to think about this for a minute let me just think about what you're saying
00:29:35.80 --> 00:29:40.52 because I want to make sure I understand that right there that right there is a response and it
00:29:40.52 --> 00:29:45.16 and if I'm prepared for it you know here's a funny one when it used to be back in the day and the
00:29:45.16 --> 00:29:52.20 deems when you would go to get your seal tried it you had it you should you got done with
00:29:52.20 --> 00:29:56.20 buds you went to a team you went through more training and then you were on probation for six
00:29:56.20 --> 00:30:02.36 months and then you had to go do an oral board for all the different departments and you had to go
00:30:02.36 --> 00:30:08.12 and program the radios and break down the weapons and build demolition charges and you know show
00:30:08.12 --> 00:30:11.24 how to put on a parachute rig and set up a diary you had to do all these different things
00:30:11.24 --> 00:30:17.72 and answer all these questions and one of the things that you learned was or you better have learned
00:30:17.72 --> 00:30:23.16 was when someone asked you a question that you don't know you better have a response for and the
00:30:23.16 --> 00:30:28.20 response is you know master chief I'm not exactly sure of the answer to that question but I know
00:30:28.20 --> 00:30:33.000 that it is in the dive manual that I can find down in the dive locker that's great that's
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.04 that's a that's a response that the master chief says all right fair enough we'll go you better get
00:30:38.04 --> 00:30:47.56 you better start learning a little bit deeper but if you go oh oh oh is it 30 feet for 30 minutes
00:30:47.56 --> 00:30:53.96 no it's not 30 feet for 30 minutes you try and BS the master chief and you're going to end up
00:30:53.96 --> 00:31:00.92 getting your ass kicked so what you do is you and we did this we roleplayed the the oral board
00:31:01.80 --> 00:31:04.92 me and my friends that had showed up at sealed team one and we'd gone through this training
00:31:04.92 --> 00:31:09.000 and now we were getting ready for that all but we we crushed each other in those oral boards
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.40 and one of the things that we figured out was which we got you know some of the senior guys said
00:31:13.40 --> 00:31:18.92 hey listen if you don't know the answer it's okay here's the response but rehearsing that and
00:31:18.92 --> 00:31:26.36 being ready for it is infinitely better than no rehearsal going there blind and get get smacked
00:31:26.36 --> 00:31:31.96 upside the head with something you didn't expect that you will talk yourself into that you've
00:31:31.96 --> 00:31:35.96 got to cover if you're doing this alone you'll tell yourself this isn't gonna be that hard I
00:31:35.96 --> 00:31:40.12 got this covered and you go in there solo you're gonna get crushed because you just you don't
00:31:40.12 --> 00:31:47.40 have that other person that to put you in a spot and go wow hang on a second training is important yes
00:31:49.24 --> 00:31:53.64 he breaks down here organization for unit training training plans
00:31:54.92 --> 00:31:59.72 comprehensible and workable plans are indispensable and should be formulated with consideration of the
00:31:59.72 --> 00:32:07.000 falling for essentials established training goals that's number one number two continuous evaluation
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.88 this process must go on throughout the training cycle and as an integral part of it
00:32:14.68 --> 00:32:19.40 only by continuous evaluation can deficiencies be discovered early enough to make immediate
00:32:19.40 --> 00:32:26.12 correction possible number three testing closely related to evaluation is the more formal testing
00:32:26.12 --> 00:32:30.52 that is given to an individual or unit at the conclusion of a phase of training or block of
00:32:30.52 --> 00:32:35.40 instruction it's here that we determine whether our training goals have been met number four
00:32:35.40 --> 00:32:42.36 remedial training I must emphasize here the value of remedial or makeup training once event once a
00:32:42.36 --> 00:32:47.56 valuation in testing have identified the areas of deficiency remedial training must be used to correct them
00:32:48.20 --> 00:32:53.72 it should be an integral part of every training schedule of course the instruction will be designed to
00:32:53.72 --> 00:32:57.96 overcome specific weaknesses that have been exposed by the testing program and will have
00:32:58.52 --> 00:33:03.64 to be keyed to the specific needs of your unit it is essential however that remedial training
00:33:03.64 --> 00:33:10.68 be regularly scheduled gosh that makes sense so those are the four things established training goals
00:33:10.68 --> 00:33:18.52 continuous evaluation testing and remedial training what would that was their tests whether tests
00:33:18.52 --> 00:33:25.000 at each phase of top gun as you are going through the training yeah absolutely what was an example of
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.20 a test the most common test that we give is that we'd want to make sure the students understood
00:33:30.20 --> 00:33:35.72 the mechanics of a system so how a missile system worked how the targeting system worked how the
00:33:35.72 --> 00:33:39.32 radar system worked you out we wanted to make sure they understood the mechanics of it
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:45.56 before they use it in practical terms it probably isn't too much different than your experience
00:33:45.56 --> 00:33:49.64 of understanding how the radios worked before you were using them in the field right you have
00:33:49.64 --> 00:33:55.40 to understand hf propagation yeah you did you have to understand the i honest fear you you
00:33:55.40 --> 00:33:59.96 absolutely did because what happened is you're going to find yourself in a position and this is
00:33:59.96 --> 00:34:04.92 me I don't know I wasn't that position is if you're in a particular geography particular place
00:34:04.92 --> 00:34:09.40 and talking to a particular other person some radios going to work better than other radios
00:34:09.40 --> 00:34:13.72 this is true you might need to know hey you know what we're like in the bushes here in the
00:34:13.72 --> 00:34:17.48 in the wilderness so in the jungle this radio doesn't work here doesn't penetrate through this
00:34:17.48 --> 00:34:22.52 this thing so there's a million different examples of that if you get that out of order and you
00:34:22.52 --> 00:34:27.24 just work you you learn how to maneuver the system like my my my cursor moves at the here I
00:34:27.24 --> 00:34:31.80 move my my cursor on the display here and you don't actually know what's happening to the mechanics
00:34:31.80 --> 00:34:38.20 behind that you're going to start making mistakes inside in specific settings oh it work here
00:34:38.20 --> 00:34:42.36 so much work everywhere like no it doesn't work everywhere this environment is optimized here
00:34:42.36 --> 00:34:45.88 this environment it doesn't work at all and if all you know is the mechanics and not what's
00:34:45.88 --> 00:34:50.12 happening behind it you actually can't apply it when it matters the most you know what that made me
00:34:50.12 --> 00:34:57.64 think of the book Leadership Strategy and Tactics by me because it's I say an exact same thing
00:34:57.64 --> 00:35:03.16 but when I'm talking I compare I compare a leader to a woodworker and talk about the fact
00:35:03.16 --> 00:35:08.28 that you know when you're a leader you got to know the different tools but then you got a
00:35:08.28 --> 00:35:11.48 if you're a woodworker you've got to know the different tools and then you've got to know the
00:35:11.48 --> 00:35:14.60 different types of wood and then you've got to know how to apply those different types
00:35:14.60 --> 00:35:17.40 those different tools to different types of wood and then you've got to realize that even
00:35:17.40 --> 00:35:21.20 each individual piece of wood, a piece of pine is super soft,
00:35:21.20 --> 00:35:22.64 a piece of oak is super hard.
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:24.60 You gotta use those tools differently
00:35:24.60 --> 00:35:26.56 with those different types of wood,
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:28.52 and then on top of that,
00:35:28.52 --> 00:35:31.72 each individual piece of pine is different.
00:35:31.72 --> 00:35:34.28 It has a not, it has a rift, it has a cut,
00:35:34.28 --> 00:35:37.24 it has a split, and you gotta know how to deal with that.
00:35:37.24 --> 00:35:39.60 So you gotta understand the principles of the tools.
00:35:42.12 --> 00:35:45.12 I may regularly plagiarize the hell at that book,
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:46.84 but I don't know where to go.
00:35:46.84 --> 00:35:48.000 Check.
00:35:49.16 --> 00:35:51.20 Talks about assignment of administrative tasks.
00:35:51.20 --> 00:35:54.48 He talks about when a unit is under strength.
00:35:54.48 --> 00:35:57.000 Reduce strengths must be offset
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.04 by more efficient utilization of men and women.
00:35:59.04 --> 00:36:00.72 Now, you know, I gotta ask this question today,
00:36:00.72 --> 00:36:01.92 we've buy a client.
00:36:01.92 --> 00:36:03.32 Yeah, but we don't, we don't, we don't,
00:36:03.32 --> 00:36:04.60 we need more people.
00:36:04.60 --> 00:36:07.64 Guess what, everybody, everybody needs more people.
00:36:08.76 --> 00:36:12.52 We got visited by a senior ranking officer
00:36:12.52 --> 00:36:14.64 in the Seal Teams, what are we in the Rmadi?
00:36:14.64 --> 00:36:16.68 And at Lafelite's tell the story,
00:36:16.68 --> 00:36:20.96 the, you know, great, great officer, huge supporter,
00:36:20.96 --> 00:36:23.28 says, hey, what else do you need out here?
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:24.72 Is there anything else you need?
00:36:24.72 --> 00:36:27.08 And I said, I need two more tasks units worth of men.
00:36:27.08 --> 00:36:32.08 You know, like we had enough missions to get everybody busy.
00:36:32.08 --> 00:36:33.72 But guess what, we didn't get anybody.
00:36:33.72 --> 00:36:35.88 We didn't, you know, like that's the way it works.
00:36:37.68 --> 00:36:40.56 Next little section in Jack Realism.
00:36:40.56 --> 00:36:44.32 The experienced commander knows that soldiers do
00:36:44.32 --> 00:36:46.36 and combat exactly what they have been taught
00:36:46.36 --> 00:36:47.72 and have practiced in training.
00:36:47.72 --> 00:36:50.36 Therefore, each training situation and problem
00:36:50.36 --> 00:36:52.88 must be as valid and realistic as possible
00:36:52.88 --> 00:36:56.80 with unreal or artificial aspects eliminated.
00:36:56.80 --> 00:36:59.52 Training must reflect as many of the conditions,
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:02.32 scenes, noises and situations of the battlefield
00:37:02.32 --> 00:37:07.32 as ingenuity can conceive and safety rules will permit.
00:37:07.32 --> 00:37:12.32 And I remember, I remember I put on, we'd be doing,
00:37:13.88 --> 00:37:15.56 when I got back from my last plan,
00:37:15.56 --> 00:37:18.68 when we got back from Madi and I took over training,
00:37:18.68 --> 00:37:21.64 a few months into that, when you would put on your nods
00:37:21.64 --> 00:37:24.32 at night, you would, you might as well be in Iraq.
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:26.12 You might as well have been in Iraq.
00:37:26.12 --> 00:37:30.08 We had, we had the, the speakers playing gun battles
00:37:30.08 --> 00:37:31.84 and called a prayer.
00:37:31.84 --> 00:37:33.84 We had tires burning.
00:37:33.84 --> 00:37:36.80 We had people dressed up like, you know, local Iraq.
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:38.48 He said, it's in walking around.
00:37:38.48 --> 00:37:40.32 It was freaking awesome.
00:37:40.32 --> 00:37:42.28 It was freaking awesome.
00:37:42.28 --> 00:37:43.76 That's what you're supposed to do.
00:37:46.36 --> 00:37:47.20 Damn, I remember that.
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:49.88 The first time we were rolling into the Moulab
00:37:49.88 --> 00:37:51.48 and it was early in the morning.
00:37:51.48 --> 00:37:54.56 It was, it was actually when the blue on blue happened
00:37:54.56 --> 00:37:57.12 in extreme ownership, but we were rolling in there.
00:37:58.16 --> 00:38:01.84 I remember rolling in like there's tires burning in the streets
00:38:01.84 --> 00:38:04.88 and yeah, I was like, okay,
00:38:04.88 --> 00:38:06.92 because what does that do that screws up your nods?
00:38:06.92 --> 00:38:08.24 And luckily the sun was coming up,
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:09.76 but it was still dark outside,
00:38:09.76 --> 00:38:12.000 but I'm thinking these, these Mujahideen fighters,
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.72 know what they're doing.
00:38:13.72 --> 00:38:15.12 These guys know what they're doing.
00:38:15.12 --> 00:38:16.32 They're, and then guess what?
00:38:16.32 --> 00:38:18.000 So it messes up your night vision,
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.56 we understand that these burning fires
00:38:19.56 --> 00:38:21.08 and then the sun comes up.
00:38:21.08 --> 00:38:23.52 Well now there's just black, smoke everywhere.
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.92 And you can gear and damn,
00:38:29.92 --> 00:38:33.16 to you that when I got back and I was running training,
00:38:33.16 --> 00:38:34.48 you rolled out of the street.
00:38:34.48 --> 00:38:35.76 We're burning tires.
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:37.44 Your night vision is gonna be all jacked up
00:38:37.44 --> 00:38:39.24 and when you're done with the night vision being all jacked up
00:38:39.24 --> 00:38:41.44 and the sun comes up, guess what?
00:38:41.44 --> 00:38:43.24 It's gonna be black smoke everywhere.
00:38:44.76 --> 00:38:47.36 One of the best ways to emphasize realism
00:38:47.36 --> 00:38:50.20 is to assess personnel casualties
00:38:50.20 --> 00:38:53.76 for improper use of cover, or in the case of night exercise
00:38:53.76 --> 00:38:55.24 as vehicles can be knocked out for on off,
00:38:55.24 --> 00:38:56.08 rise to use of nights.
00:38:56.08 --> 00:38:58.000 What does that mean you're putting people down?
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000 This is like trade-et instructions.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000 I might as well have written this for trade-et to use.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.24 This is exactly what we did.
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:08.48 Oh, you're not saying to my cover, cool, you're dead.
00:39:09.48 --> 00:39:11.24 Oh, you're gonna move out, cross an open street
00:39:11.24 --> 00:39:12.76 without any cover fire, Roger that, you're dead,
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:13.84 you're down, man.
00:39:13.84 --> 00:39:15.20 Now let's get this thing figured out.
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:17.28 Oh, by the way, your buddy wants to come help you immediately
00:39:17.28 --> 00:39:19.96 without putting down suppressor fire, cool, he's dead too.
00:39:19.96 --> 00:39:21.88 Let's rock and roll, who wants to figure this out?
00:39:21.88 --> 00:39:24.84 Who wants to put the cover in cover, move?
00:39:24.84 --> 00:39:26.08 Dude, you're literally like,
00:39:26.08 --> 00:39:28.52 I wrote that thing down fundamental sound and realistic.
00:39:28.52 --> 00:39:29.80 Oh, cool, you're not applying the fundamentals?
00:39:29.80 --> 00:39:30.88 Good, you're dead.
00:39:30.88 --> 00:39:32.12 Oh, your tactics aren't sound?
00:39:32.12 --> 00:39:32.96 Cool, he's gone.
00:39:32.96 --> 00:39:33.80 Now what are you gonna do?
00:39:33.80 --> 00:39:35.36 I mean, I should have a track,
00:39:35.36 --> 00:39:38.04 or I should literally just be marking how many times he and you
00:39:38.04 --> 00:39:41.08 were referring back to the realism that's required.
00:39:41.08 --> 00:39:44.80 And the beauty of that, especially when you have experiences,
00:39:44.80 --> 00:39:47.08 it completely takes away the ammunition of,
00:39:47.08 --> 00:39:48.64 this would never happen.
00:39:48.64 --> 00:39:50.16 Or this is unrealistic, you know,
00:39:50.16 --> 00:39:53.000 them the, the, the, the, the unwindable scenarios,
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.20 we go, well, this would never happen.
00:39:54.20 --> 00:39:55.04 Oh, really?
00:39:55.04 --> 00:39:56.52 Oh, cool, this would never happen.
00:39:56.52 --> 00:39:57.36 Watch this.
00:39:57.36 --> 00:39:58.20 Yeah.
00:39:58.20 --> 00:40:00.84 And the easier the training is,
00:40:00.84 --> 00:40:04.32 the more acclimated people get to things being easy.
00:40:04.32 --> 00:40:06.76 And the more unwilling they are to believe how difficult
00:40:06.76 --> 00:40:08.04 they can be.
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:09.24 And when you're training is realistic,
00:40:09.24 --> 00:40:10.88 how many times have you told me
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:13.60 and everybody the story of Seth's first firefighter,
00:40:13.60 --> 00:40:18.08 and the guys like, wow, how many firefighters have you been in?
00:40:18.08 --> 00:40:20.32 You must be, and he's like,
00:40:20.32 --> 00:40:21.16 it was my first one.
00:40:21.16 --> 00:40:22.16 That was my first one.
00:40:22.16 --> 00:40:24.84 That comes from fundamental sound, realistic training.
00:40:24.84 --> 00:40:26.16 Yeah. And putting that guy in position,
00:40:26.16 --> 00:40:27.84 I might not be in a, I don't know what this is.
00:40:27.84 --> 00:40:28.88 I can't recreate this scenario.
00:40:28.88 --> 00:40:30.44 I don't know exactly how it's gonna play out,
00:40:30.44 --> 00:40:32.24 but I do know what it's gonna be.
00:40:32.24 --> 00:40:34.72 I do understand how this is gonna reveal itself.
00:40:34.72 --> 00:40:36.32 And the only way to prepare for that is
00:40:36.32 --> 00:40:37.88 fundamental sound, realistic training,
00:40:37.88 --> 00:40:39.24 over and over and over again.
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:44.44 Emphasis on night training.
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:47.52 Self-sufficiency and confidence,
00:40:47.52 --> 00:40:50.12 our key factors in developing a unit's capability
00:40:50.12 --> 00:40:51.12 for night operations.
00:40:51.12 --> 00:40:53.84 And this was just, you know,
00:40:53.84 --> 00:40:55.88 not gonna spend a bunch of time on this because now
00:40:55.88 --> 00:40:58.24 we've got night vision, but what is more important?
00:40:58.24 --> 00:40:59.08 What do we talk about?
00:40:59.08 --> 00:41:01.12 Talk about night vision versus night night vision.
00:41:01.12 --> 00:41:04.12 What I'm talking about is, put your troops
00:41:04.12 --> 00:41:06.68 into hard training situations.
00:41:06.68 --> 00:41:08.20 That's what you need to do.
00:41:08.20 --> 00:41:11.20 Put your troops into the most difficult of situations
00:41:11.20 --> 00:41:12.84 because when you're used to fighting at night,
00:41:12.84 --> 00:41:14.56 even a pretty night vision,
00:41:14.56 --> 00:41:16.20 if you're used to fighting at night,
00:41:16.20 --> 00:41:17.40 number one, yes, you get used to it.
00:41:17.40 --> 00:41:19.28 Number two, fighting at the day becomes easy.
00:41:21.92 --> 00:41:24.28 It makes fighting at the day become easy.
00:41:24.28 --> 00:41:26.48 And it also gives you a potential advantage.
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:28.52 If it just so happens that your competition
00:41:28.52 --> 00:41:31.60 isn't willing to put in the hard training at night,
00:41:32.72 --> 00:41:34.48 good, you're gonna dominate.
00:41:35.60 --> 00:41:36.56 It's the same thing here,
00:41:36.56 --> 00:41:37.80 Incoming weather training.
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:40.96 I gotta read this one though, because it's funny.
00:41:40.96 --> 00:41:43.20 Adverse weather will inevitably be encountered
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:45.40 and combat and will give rise to problems
00:41:45.40 --> 00:41:47.08 that can best be solved by experience.
00:41:47.08 --> 00:41:48.56 It will have an impact on a mobility,
00:41:48.56 --> 00:41:50.96 on maintenance of vehicle and equipment,
00:41:50.96 --> 00:41:53.36 on observation on the availability of tactical air support
00:41:53.36 --> 00:41:55.08 and in fact will hinder tactical operations
00:41:55.08 --> 00:41:57.24 in every conceivable way.
00:41:57.24 --> 00:41:59.40 Adverse weather conditions can be turned into
00:41:59.40 --> 00:42:01.28 an asset during battle, however.
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:02.12 Boom, there you go.
00:42:02.12 --> 00:42:04.56 So we're already, look, bad weather, good.
00:42:06.28 --> 00:42:08.52 Commanders should take every advantage
00:42:08.52 --> 00:42:10.44 of training under such conditions.
00:42:10.44 --> 00:42:12.08 Troops who have mastered the problems
00:42:12.08 --> 00:42:14.56 of operating effectively in spite of the weather
00:42:14.56 --> 00:42:17.52 can turn low visibility, extreme height,
00:42:17.52 --> 00:42:21.36 biting cold or heavy rain into tactical advantage
00:42:21.36 --> 00:42:23.44 against an enemy not so well adapted
00:42:23.44 --> 00:42:25.64 to these adverse conditions.
00:42:25.64 --> 00:42:28.32 So that's everything you just said, and it's this,
00:42:28.32 --> 00:42:32.44 the solution of rainy day schedule is to put on the raincoat
00:42:32.44 --> 00:42:34.64 and take full advantage the adverse conditions
00:42:34.64 --> 00:42:38.12 for profitable field training and experience.
00:42:38.12 --> 00:42:39.56 Totally legit.
00:42:39.56 --> 00:42:42.96 You know what's fun in the in the teams?
00:42:44.40 --> 00:42:49.40 When there's giant waves like when a massive storm comes
00:42:50.24 --> 00:42:54.12 and there's massive just destroyer waves,
00:42:54.12 --> 00:42:56.16 it's like time to go out and do surf passage
00:42:56.16 --> 00:42:58.80 with the zodiacs and just get annihilated.
00:42:58.80 --> 00:43:00.000 It's so fun.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.04 I think that with bud students, oh, it's below.
00:43:02.04 --> 00:43:03.88 The waves are freaking just giant cool.
00:43:03.88 --> 00:43:05.64 Get your boats, you're going to do surf passage
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:08.52 or sometimes get to get your swim in the teams.
00:43:08.52 --> 00:43:09.84 It was a hey, rig up the zodiacs.
00:43:09.84 --> 00:43:11.44 We're going to go get some experience and this stuff.
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:13.56 That's which absolutely you have to do.
00:43:13.56 --> 00:43:15.60 If you're in the teams and there's big waves
00:43:15.60 --> 00:43:18.44 in Coronado or Virginia Beach
00:43:18.44 --> 00:43:21.04 and you're not getting shocked up to go get some,
00:43:21.04 --> 00:43:23.04 you're wrong, get your platoon together
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:24.84 and get them out there and get them after it.
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:28.72 Cross training for flexibility,
00:43:28.72 --> 00:43:30.60 cross training is vital to any organization.
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:32.60 When your personnel are trained in several jobs,
00:43:32.60 --> 00:43:34.84 you have achieved depth and capability
00:43:34.84 --> 00:43:36.88 that may well split the difference
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:38.60 between success and failure and combat.
00:43:40.60 --> 00:43:43.52 Of course, needless switching of personnel
00:43:43.52 --> 00:43:45.12 from one job to another is harmful.
00:43:45.12 --> 00:43:47.08 So cross train, but that doesn't mean you switch them
00:43:47.08 --> 00:43:47.92 completely.
00:43:47.92 --> 00:43:50.24 Training personnel and duties other than their primary
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:52.80 MLS, however, will increase your peace time efficiency
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:54.68 and subsequent combat effectiveness.
00:43:54.68 --> 00:43:57.68 It will also make the individual a more valuable asset
00:43:57.68 --> 00:44:00.04 to the Army increases pride in self confidence
00:44:00.04 --> 00:44:02.64 and may well help them qualify for promotion.
00:44:02.64 --> 00:44:05.44 But a little time spent cross training
00:44:05.44 --> 00:44:09.12 will be amply rewarded in the increased overall
00:44:09.12 --> 00:44:10.20 effectiveness of your unit.
00:44:10.20 --> 00:44:12.16 Everyone will benefit.
00:44:12.16 --> 00:44:13.44 Not the least of you is the commander.
00:44:13.44 --> 00:44:14.40 He's throw his that in there.
00:44:14.40 --> 00:44:15.04 Everyone's so nice.
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:15.88 Got a little eat.
00:44:15.88 --> 00:44:17.72 Let's look south.
00:44:17.72 --> 00:44:19.32 Everyone's in the wild.
00:44:19.32 --> 00:44:20.96 We hear it.
00:44:20.96 --> 00:44:22.92 Got to be something driving this guy to do 45 years
00:44:22.92 --> 00:44:24.80 in the Army I reckon.
00:44:24.80 --> 00:44:26.20 But he likes that.
00:44:26.20 --> 00:44:27.28 Take care of the troops.
00:44:27.28 --> 00:44:29.20 Also, a little Benny.
00:44:29.20 --> 00:44:31.32 A little side Benny for the man.
00:44:34.60 --> 00:44:37.56 Chaining, chain of command, a good organization always has
00:44:37.56 --> 00:44:39.36 a smoothly functioning chain of command,
00:44:39.36 --> 00:44:41.40 a sound training program properly supervised
00:44:41.40 --> 00:44:43.08 can be the primary means of developing
00:44:43.08 --> 00:44:46.04 the proper functioning of the chain of command,
00:44:46.04 --> 00:44:46.88 which is also essential.
00:44:46.88 --> 00:44:49.04 And combat, a good commander will guide the development
00:44:49.04 --> 00:44:50.92 of his unit to ensure that subordinate
00:44:50.92 --> 00:44:54.32 commanders retain and use their authority and responsibility
00:44:54.32 --> 00:44:55.24 in any unit.
00:44:55.24 --> 00:44:57.88 The non-commissioner officer plays a leading role.
00:44:57.88 --> 00:44:59.56 That's your front line managers.
00:44:59.56 --> 00:45:01.96 He must be carefully instructed given responsibility
00:45:01.96 --> 00:45:03.32 in the held accountable.
00:45:03.32 --> 00:45:05.56 I frequently find squad beaters,
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:09.000 ignoring their team leaders by issuing orders,
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.40 giving fire commands and taking other actions
00:45:11.40 --> 00:45:14.24 directly with the individual members of the squad.
00:45:14.24 --> 00:45:16.44 Even worse, I found responsible officers
00:45:16.44 --> 00:45:19.04 who were condoning these mistakes.
00:45:19.04 --> 00:45:21.08 The squad leaders should use his team leaders
00:45:21.08 --> 00:45:24.04 to exercise control over the squad at all times.
00:45:25.40 --> 00:45:28.40 Commanders should supervise a soul battle drill
00:45:28.40 --> 00:45:30.76 and squad exercise to ensure that squad leaders
00:45:30.76 --> 00:45:34.76 understand and apply the principle of exercising command
00:45:34.76 --> 00:45:37.12 over the rifle squad through designated team leaders.
00:45:37.12 --> 00:45:38.84 So don't throw the chain of command.
00:45:38.84 --> 00:45:40.36 Let your subordinate leaders lead.
00:45:43.52 --> 00:45:45.40 Self-sufficiency and confidence confidence
00:45:45.40 --> 00:45:48.60 to fight semi-independently under conditions
00:45:48.60 --> 00:45:53.04 of decentralized control is developed by training exercises.
00:45:53.04 --> 00:45:55.04 Current concepts of warfare,
00:45:55.04 --> 00:45:57.36 visualizing greater dispersion on the battlefield.
00:45:57.36 --> 00:45:59.64 So we're more spread out, dictate the necessity
00:45:59.64 --> 00:46:03.24 for units to acquire self-confidence and self-sufficiency.
00:46:03.24 --> 00:46:06.20 These aspects can be developed in most tactical exercises
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:08.92 and can be furthered through realistic use
00:46:08.92 --> 00:46:11.80 of active aggressor forces.
00:46:14.80 --> 00:46:16.40 Force on force training.
00:46:16.40 --> 00:46:18.76 That's what we want to do.
00:46:18.76 --> 00:46:21.68 Ranger type operations also instill confidence
00:46:21.68 --> 00:46:24.12 and show the need for self-sufficiency.
00:46:24.12 --> 00:46:28.12 When out of physical contact with friendly forces
00:46:28.12 --> 00:46:31.12 or beyond the range of mutual fire support,
00:46:31.12 --> 00:46:33.36 so we're not covering and moving anymore,
00:46:33.36 --> 00:46:35.76 the isolated unit becomes a problem.
00:46:37.04 --> 00:46:39.48 And our training commander should recognize
00:46:39.48 --> 00:46:41.88 the plight of the isolated unit,
00:46:41.88 --> 00:46:43.60 not by simulating it,
00:46:43.60 --> 00:46:45.92 but by actually demonstrating it.
00:46:45.92 --> 00:46:47.48 When the small unit is confronted
00:46:47.48 --> 00:46:50.36 with an isolated mission, confidence can always be instilled
00:46:50.36 --> 00:46:52.48 by ensuring that procedures are established
00:46:52.48 --> 00:46:54.52 for maintaining communications and for rallying
00:46:54.52 --> 00:46:56.72 to its support if required.
00:46:57.96 --> 00:47:01.56 Training should be aimed at developing integrated procedures
00:47:01.56 --> 00:47:03.32 for the employment of Army aviation
00:47:03.32 --> 00:47:05.64 and Air Force troop carrier troop movements
00:47:05.64 --> 00:47:07.20 for resupply and medical evacuation.
00:47:07.20 --> 00:47:11.44 So we have to learn to work independently,
00:47:11.44 --> 00:47:15.40 but we always have to be able to support each other.
00:47:15.40 --> 00:47:17.16 We're alone out on the battlefield, we die.
00:47:17.16 --> 00:47:18.48 You mean there's a balance there?
00:47:18.48 --> 00:47:19.80 There's a balance.
00:47:19.80 --> 00:47:22.64 There is a little dichotomy, but cover move.
00:47:23.76 --> 00:47:25.76 There's another doctrinal term that I love
00:47:25.76 --> 00:47:27.80 is supporting distance.
00:47:27.80 --> 00:47:30.40 I'm not allowed to be further away from Dave.
00:47:30.40 --> 00:47:35.40 If I can't defend Dave's position or cover for Dave
00:47:35.40 --> 00:47:37.80 because he's out of the range of my weapon systems,
00:47:37.80 --> 00:47:38.72 he's too far away.
00:47:40.04 --> 00:47:41.84 That's a perfect example of the cross-training
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:42.68 he's talking about.
00:47:42.68 --> 00:47:43.92 I could be an infantryman.
00:47:43.92 --> 00:47:47.20 Do I need to be an expert on indirect fires?
00:47:47.20 --> 00:47:50.24 No, I probably don't need to know how to field strip every little,
00:47:50.24 --> 00:47:52.80 but you don't need to know how far that thing can shoot.
00:47:52.80 --> 00:47:55.24 Because if I get too far away from that supporting element
00:47:55.24 --> 00:47:57.48 and I go, well, the reason I got too far away
00:47:57.48 --> 00:48:00.20 is I didn't know how mortars worked.
00:48:00.20 --> 00:48:02.84 Cool, the outcome is your team gets annihilated.
00:48:02.84 --> 00:48:04.96 So do I need to know every single thing
00:48:04.96 --> 00:48:06.44 that the mortarple student commander knows?
00:48:06.44 --> 00:48:08.20 No, you don't, but you gotta know a little bit.
00:48:08.20 --> 00:48:10.36 You gotta know how you and you interact together.
00:48:10.36 --> 00:48:12.16 And so even that idea of cross-training is,
00:48:12.16 --> 00:48:14.16 if you don't have a sort of a functional understanding
00:48:14.16 --> 00:48:15.92 inside your company, use the example
00:48:15.92 --> 00:48:20.04 before of the salespeople and the customer satisfaction people.
00:48:20.04 --> 00:48:22.04 If you're a sales lead,
00:48:22.04 --> 00:48:24.08 and the only metric you measure for success
00:48:24.08 --> 00:48:25.88 is how much you sell,
00:48:25.88 --> 00:48:28.08 and you don't realize that in the return department,
00:48:28.08 --> 00:48:30.52 that number is the same, you're losing.
00:48:30.52 --> 00:48:32.76 You're losing because there's a piece that you don't,
00:48:32.76 --> 00:48:34.24 do you have to know everything they know?
00:48:34.24 --> 00:48:35.92 You don't, and actually you don't have time
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:36.92 to know everything you know,
00:48:36.92 --> 00:48:38.000 but you gotta know enough.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.48 You gotta have enough understanding
00:48:39.48 --> 00:48:41.92 what's going on there to measure the success
00:48:41.92 --> 00:48:44.04 of the entire organization to include your team,
00:48:44.04 --> 00:48:45.80 and that requires a little bit of cross-training.
00:48:45.80 --> 00:48:49.32 And that is a perfect example of how come you need to know
00:48:49.32 --> 00:48:50.96 something about everybody.
00:48:54.08 --> 00:48:56.04 Small unit tactical exercises.
00:48:56.04 --> 00:48:58.000 Tactical exercises should be,
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.84 as well prepared as training tests.
00:48:59.84 --> 00:49:00.72 As often as possible,
00:49:00.72 --> 00:49:02.44 the tactical situation for a field exercise
00:49:02.44 --> 00:49:05.04 should be laid in the framework of an echelon,
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:07.84 one or two levels higher than participating unit.
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:09.64 This is desirable to bring into play
00:49:09.64 --> 00:49:11.52 the necessary intelligence supply
00:49:11.52 --> 00:49:14.68 of evacuation in similar roles of supporting forces
00:49:14.68 --> 00:49:17.40 that have a bearing on the specific tactical operation.
00:49:17.40 --> 00:49:19.48 Don't confuse the squad leader however,
00:49:19.48 --> 00:49:21.80 by giving him everything that was
00:49:21.80 --> 00:49:24.68 in the battalion and company commanders orders.
00:49:24.68 --> 00:49:28.76 That's an interesting little point to bring up
00:49:28.76 --> 00:49:32.28 is that, well, they're saying that you need to test
00:49:32.28 --> 00:49:33.74 the subordinate unit, so you know,
00:49:33.74 --> 00:49:35.84 subordinate leadership unit, you can't just,
00:49:35.84 --> 00:49:37.92 and this is true in the SEAL teams,
00:49:37.92 --> 00:49:39.56 I can't test myself.
00:49:39.56 --> 00:49:44.56 If I'm relying on me as the platoon leader to test my platoon,
00:49:44.96 --> 00:49:46.72 it's very difficult to do that.
00:49:46.72 --> 00:49:47.80 Look, and it can happen,
00:49:47.80 --> 00:49:49.36 and there's some great platoon leaders that'll be able
00:49:49.36 --> 00:49:52.28 to do that, but there's platoon leaders that will,
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:55.12 they'll pass every test for some reason with flying colors,
00:49:55.12 --> 00:49:57.64 because they're not really being tested.
00:49:57.64 --> 00:50:01.64 So it's good when you are utilizing the chain of command
00:50:01.64 --> 00:50:06.32 and some of the elements above to test the elements below.
00:50:06.32 --> 00:50:10.84 So that makes sense, again, he always emphasizes
00:50:10.84 --> 00:50:13.64 all exercises to be conducted under simulated combat conditions.
00:50:13.64 --> 00:50:16.12 I think we've covered that one enough.
00:50:18.76 --> 00:50:20.76 Despite limitations on our capabilities
00:50:20.76 --> 00:50:23.16 to conduct field exercises and combined arms training,
00:50:23.16 --> 00:50:24.60 I'm convinced that commanders can always
00:50:24.60 --> 00:50:27.52 devise ways and means of achieving essential training
00:50:27.52 --> 00:50:30.04 objectives. Now I'll give you an example that.
00:50:30.04 --> 00:50:34.32 We would want to have close air support
00:50:34.32 --> 00:50:36.60 in our urban environment for training.
00:50:36.60 --> 00:50:39.60 We'd want to have an AC 130 overhead.
00:50:39.60 --> 00:50:41.56 We'd want to have F-18s overhead.
00:50:41.56 --> 00:50:43.76 We'd want to have a Marine Corps fighter squadron
00:50:43.76 --> 00:50:45.64 ready to combat drop bombs for us.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.40 That doesn't always happen.
00:50:48.40 --> 00:50:52.04 In fact, it's very rare that we would get those live assets.
00:50:52.04 --> 00:50:53.04 So what would we do?
00:50:53.04 --> 00:50:55.52 We would either bring a pilot,
00:50:55.52 --> 00:50:58.24 or we'd bring a J-TAC, a person that was qualified to call,
00:50:58.24 --> 00:50:59.72 and we'd put them up on one of the buildings
00:50:59.72 --> 00:51:02.20 in our Mount Facility and we'd give them a radio.
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:04.84 And look, it's almost the same thing.
00:51:04.84 --> 00:51:07.72 You know, you got a guy that understands how pilots talk
00:51:07.72 --> 00:51:10.44 and he imitates a pilot talking on the radio.
00:51:10.44 --> 00:51:13.08 And then we would put up simulated explosions to go off
00:51:13.08 --> 00:51:15.28 when they dropped the bomb in the right spot.
00:51:15.28 --> 00:51:18.28 We would blow something up and they'd get that.
00:51:19.68 --> 00:51:21.000 They'd get that satisfaction.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.04 Ha ha ha ha.
00:51:22.04 --> 00:51:23.64 In fact, there was a company we were using
00:51:23.64 --> 00:51:26.04 that had little model airplanes.
00:51:26.04 --> 00:51:27.36 They were actually big model airplanes,
00:51:27.36 --> 00:51:30.56 but the model airplanes would fly over
00:51:30.56 --> 00:51:32.24 and then explosions would happen.
00:51:32.24 --> 00:51:35.36 We kind of went the distance to fake the training realistic.
00:51:35.36 --> 00:51:38.36 Launching these, you know, F-18s that would come down
00:51:38.36 --> 00:51:42.08 and strafe the city and explosions would go off,
00:51:42.08 --> 00:51:43.96 pretty good, but that's a great way to do it.
00:51:43.96 --> 00:51:46.92 And what does it cost for me to give the radio
00:51:46.92 --> 00:51:49.16 to one of my J-TACs and stay at an building?
00:51:49.16 --> 00:51:51.96 It costs $0.00.
00:51:51.96 --> 00:51:54.72 What does it cost to get an F-18
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:57.44 to give me, or a section of F-18s
00:51:57.44 --> 00:51:59.56 to give me a few hours of support
00:51:59.56 --> 00:52:02.88 because what, $100,000?
00:52:03.80 --> 00:52:04.64 Yeah.
00:52:05.44 --> 00:52:09.64 How much, how much fuel do you burn in an F-18?
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:11.28 In an hour, 10,000 pounds?
00:52:11.28 --> 00:52:12.44 Ha ha ha ha ha.
00:52:12.44 --> 00:52:14.64 Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
00:52:14.64 --> 00:52:15.44 Yes.
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:16.28 Check.
00:52:17.48 --> 00:52:18.48 Check.
00:52:18.64 --> 00:52:19.96 Fffffffffffffff.
00:52:19.96 --> 00:52:21.12 Fffffffff.
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:23.20 So there's always ways, figure ways out.
00:52:24.48 --> 00:52:27.08 Training exercise should be concluded with a critique
00:52:27.08 --> 00:52:29.20 to provide the basis for reviewing the action
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:32.84 to indicate areas requiring additional training emphasis.
00:52:32.84 --> 00:52:33.44 Boom.
00:52:33.44 --> 00:52:34.44 Deep brief.
00:52:34.44 --> 00:52:35.56 Yes, we have to do that.
00:52:37.40 --> 00:52:39.72 The use of live ammunition is not authorized.
00:52:39.72 --> 00:52:43.000 When the use of live ammunition is not authorized
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.12 or practical, or when it's used
00:52:45.12 --> 00:52:47.92 violate safety requirements, maximum utilization
00:52:47.92 --> 00:52:49.76 should be made of various simulators.
00:52:49.76 --> 00:52:50.32 Boom.
00:52:50.32 --> 00:52:52.44 Again, I basically couldn't rip that.
00:52:52.44 --> 00:52:53.64 You were a religious saint.
00:52:53.64 --> 00:52:55.84 Simulators can duplicate the sound of artillery
00:52:55.84 --> 00:52:58.20 machine gun smoke flash and most other effects
00:52:58.20 --> 00:53:00.48 associated with the noise and conditions of the battlefield,
00:53:00.48 --> 00:53:02.28 including just tires burning.
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:09.08 Habitual use of aggressor in the field exercises
00:53:09.08 --> 00:53:12.88 is desirable to develop interest and realism.
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:16.56 The training value to the unit functioning in an aggressor role
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:18.12 should not be overlooked.
00:53:18.12 --> 00:53:20.28 The adherence to established tactical principles
00:53:20.28 --> 00:53:22.80 and techniques by the aggressor forces
00:53:22.80 --> 00:53:25.92 will aid the friendly force informing sound tackle
00:53:25.92 --> 00:53:26.96 hot habits.
00:53:26.96 --> 00:53:29.72 This is why we, in the sealed teams,
00:53:29.72 --> 00:53:33.12 picked up so much emphasis on force on force training
00:53:33.12 --> 00:53:37.92 using simunition or these high speed laser tag systems
00:53:37.92 --> 00:53:38.84 that we had.
00:53:38.84 --> 00:53:40.44 This is why.
00:53:40.44 --> 00:53:43.08 And that's basically all you guys did at Top Gun.
00:53:43.08 --> 00:53:46.20 It's 100% aggressor.
00:53:46.20 --> 00:53:48.20 And as an aggressor, what do you find at F-16?
00:53:48.20 --> 00:53:49.04 Yeah.
00:53:52.04 --> 00:53:55.04 How long does it take you to learn to fly at F-16?
00:53:55.04 --> 00:53:55.88 Not long.
00:53:55.88 --> 00:53:56.72 A couple months.
00:53:56.72 --> 00:54:00.28 If that part of it is not that hard.
00:54:00.28 --> 00:54:02.16 Are you worried when you go back to an F-18
00:54:02.16 --> 00:54:04.52 that you're going to have bad habits?
00:54:04.52 --> 00:54:06.04 There's something called negative transfer.
00:54:06.04 --> 00:54:09.60 So there's a couple of things that you got to pay attention to.
00:54:09.60 --> 00:54:11.000 You got to know that there are some differences
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.40 that if you get those wrong, those can be really bad.
00:54:13.40 --> 00:54:16.24 But most of it transfers over pretty easily.
00:54:16.24 --> 00:54:18.36 The larger issue, like you were talking about.
00:54:18.36 --> 00:54:22.24 And my first real job at Top Gun was what's called
00:54:22.24 --> 00:54:23.44 the adversary officer.
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:25.16 So my responsibility was to make sure
00:54:25.16 --> 00:54:27.76 that all the training scenarios that we developed
00:54:27.76 --> 00:54:29.04 at Top Gun on that same day.
00:54:29.04 --> 00:54:30.68 That's the good name to give some of the people
00:54:30.68 --> 00:54:31.68 that we work with.
00:54:31.68 --> 00:54:34.48 You're working with a company and you're like,
00:54:34.48 --> 00:54:35.32 oh, you know what?
00:54:35.32 --> 00:54:37.84 Maybe we'll just call you the adversarial officer.
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:38.68 The adversarial officer.
00:54:38.68 --> 00:54:40.76 There's certainly people that we work with.
00:54:40.76 --> 00:54:44.20 We're thinking, man, go, you're working with a company.
00:54:44.20 --> 00:54:48.64 You think, hey, when I bring you into where I bring up
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:51.68 your name, all I hear is like, bad things.
00:54:51.68 --> 00:54:53.08 This is not a good idea.
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:54.08 What are you doing?
00:54:54.08 --> 00:54:55.20 What's going on over here?
00:54:55.20 --> 00:54:57.52 Are you the adversarial officer here?
00:54:57.52 --> 00:54:59.64 So sorry, cut you off.
00:54:59.64 --> 00:55:01.64 No, no, I just say, you know, we were talking about
00:55:01.64 --> 00:55:03.80 the challenge of that is the adversarial officer.
00:55:03.80 --> 00:55:06.48 Adversary officers job is to make sure
00:55:06.48 --> 00:55:08.20 that the training scenarios that we built
00:55:08.20 --> 00:55:09.20 on the adversary side.
00:55:09.20 --> 00:55:13.000 So the opposing force was realistic and reflected
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.16 the capability of the enemy.
00:55:14.16 --> 00:55:18.12 So we provided real training for the blue students,
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:20.56 for the friendly fighters going out to fight,
00:55:20.56 --> 00:55:22.24 because if they went out and fought an enemy
00:55:22.24 --> 00:55:24.56 that wasn't performing the way a real enemy would,
00:55:24.56 --> 00:55:26.16 they were going to be unprepared.
00:55:26.16 --> 00:55:29.92 We had an entire, you know, sell inside of Top Gun,
00:55:29.92 --> 00:55:33.64 designed just to learn and study enemy tactics
00:55:33.64 --> 00:55:35.24 to make our training more realistic.
00:55:35.24 --> 00:55:37.72 How, what is you have, did you have to fly the F-16
00:55:37.72 --> 00:55:40.32 a certain way to simulate?
00:55:40.32 --> 00:55:43.24 Normally, when we replicated a force on force.
00:55:43.24 --> 00:55:45.36 So there is something incremental training.
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:47.84 So at the beginning of some phases of flight training,
00:55:47.84 --> 00:55:50.84 we limit the capability of the enemy aircraft
00:55:50.84 --> 00:55:53.24 to build, get some building blocks and fundamentals.
00:55:53.24 --> 00:55:55.28 But once we get to force on force training
00:55:55.28 --> 00:55:56.72 and most of Top Gun is straight up,
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:00.24 just your best game, my best game as the adversary,
00:56:00.24 --> 00:56:03.48 I'm flying the F-16 to the Max performance capability.
00:56:03.48 --> 00:56:07.24 And how did the Max performance of the F-16
00:56:07.24 --> 00:56:10.56 compare to the Max performance of the SU-27
00:56:10.56 --> 00:56:12.20 or whichever close aircraft?
00:56:12.20 --> 00:56:14.24 So it's not exactly, but close.
00:56:14.24 --> 00:56:18.72 And better than a similar aircraft, F-18 against F-18,
00:56:18.72 --> 00:56:21.28 me trying to replicate a different airplane,
00:56:21.28 --> 00:56:23.36 like at the end of their machines.
00:56:23.36 --> 00:56:26.52 Now, a different machine, even if it doesn't fully replicate
00:56:26.52 --> 00:56:28.72 the enemy, it does things differently.
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:30.84 And that alone is a really powerful tool
00:56:30.84 --> 00:56:33.16 to practice against, because it shows you things,
00:56:33.16 --> 00:56:35.16 oh, I can't do that on my machine.
00:56:35.16 --> 00:56:37.000 My machine won't do that this airplane can
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.20 and have to have a tactic to respond to that.
00:56:40.20 --> 00:56:42.72 And my mistaken in that the early 90s
00:56:42.72 --> 00:56:45.44 when I went up to Fallen and I would go through
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:47.52 some air wing training, would it be mistaken
00:56:47.52 --> 00:56:50.12 to think that they were aircraft up there besides the F-16
00:56:50.12 --> 00:56:51.64 that were acting as adversaries?
00:56:51.64 --> 00:56:53.56 No, I think you'd be correct.
00:56:53.56 --> 00:56:57.36 Did you have any other aircraft besides the F-16?
00:56:57.36 --> 00:56:58.52 What would you guys find?
00:56:58.52 --> 00:57:01.08 But what other adversary aircraft were available
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:03.60 to your opposing force?
00:57:03.60 --> 00:57:05.52 Yeah, the ones that the Navy furnished,
00:57:05.52 --> 00:57:08.44 the most common ones for the Navy were the F-5
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:09.76 and the F-16.
00:57:09.76 --> 00:57:12.36 But we also had contract air, so we had,
00:57:12.36 --> 00:57:14.32 you know, for F-5 freedom fighter?
00:57:14.32 --> 00:57:18.76 I, yes, you've got, absolutely,
00:57:18.76 --> 00:57:22.56 there was a squadron of F-5s in,
00:57:22.56 --> 00:57:25.56 as adversaries in Fallen,
00:57:25.56 --> 00:57:27.56 painted like enemy aircraft designed
00:57:27.56 --> 00:57:29.08 just to replicate an enemy threat.
00:57:29.08 --> 00:57:30.08 I remember those.
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:31.08 Dude, absolutely.
00:57:31.08 --> 00:57:32.60 And did they have red stars on them?
00:57:32.60 --> 00:57:33.44 They totally did.
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:34.44 I don't remember that.
00:57:34.44 --> 00:57:35.44 Absolutely.
00:57:35.44 --> 00:57:38.28 I actually, they might, they probably still have them.
00:57:38.28 --> 00:57:40.64 And we would outsource to, you know,
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:43.72 we get the Air Force to come bring up some F-15s
00:57:43.72 --> 00:57:45.24 that to fly with us for a class.
00:57:45.24 --> 00:57:48.64 We get, you know, a contract company to fly,
00:57:48.64 --> 00:57:50.96 you know, French morageers and Israeli-Coffeeers,
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:53.56 just whatever was out there to give you,
00:57:53.56 --> 00:57:57.000 the student, what we call a dissimilar look.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.12 F-18s against F-18s is not a great way
00:57:59.12 --> 00:58:00.48 to replicate real training.
00:58:00.48 --> 00:58:02.64 So you wanna give something that's different.
00:58:02.64 --> 00:58:04.56 Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse,
00:58:04.56 --> 00:58:06.56 but the fact that it's different
00:58:06.56 --> 00:58:09.96 creates much more realistic training.
00:58:09.96 --> 00:58:12.32 Well, why is it when I read about,
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:15.96 like old school fighter and like test pilots?
00:58:16.96 --> 00:58:19.08 Like reading when we had Dan Patterson on,
00:58:19.08 --> 00:58:20.88 they're just getting in different aircraft.
00:58:20.88 --> 00:58:23.48 They're just flying out to Area 51,
00:58:23.48 --> 00:58:26.20 and just getting in random A-S and aircraft
00:58:26.20 --> 00:58:28.20 and just flying those things.
00:58:28.20 --> 00:58:31.60 Is that because those old school aircraft
00:58:31.60 --> 00:58:34.80 were more similar in terms of the way you fly them?
00:58:34.80 --> 00:58:36.28 No, man, I just think that those guys
00:58:36.28 --> 00:58:37.68 weren't afraid of anything.
00:58:37.68 --> 00:58:38.88 I'm like, I can fly that thing.
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:40.04 I'm like, whatever.
00:58:40.04 --> 00:58:43.16 No, I think it was, you know,
00:58:43.16 --> 00:58:47.80 one of the coolest things that Dan Patterson talked about
00:58:47.80 --> 00:58:50.28 here on the podcast and just in general was the idea
00:58:50.28 --> 00:58:54.96 that hey, we need to go figure out how this stuff works.
00:58:54.96 --> 00:58:56.12 We need to get in these machines
00:58:56.12 --> 00:58:57.32 and figure out how they work.
00:58:57.32 --> 00:59:01.12 And if we don't, we're gonna go across to Vietnam
00:59:01.12 --> 00:59:02.28 and we're gonna lose,
00:59:02.28 --> 00:59:04.28 because we don't know how those machines work.
00:59:04.28 --> 00:59:06.76 And regulations and restrictions and safety.
00:59:06.76 --> 00:59:08.48 And all these things were forces,
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:09.72 were counterweights to doing that.
00:59:09.72 --> 00:59:11.36 All the reasons not to doing.
00:59:11.36 --> 00:59:12.20 Was there a risk?
00:59:12.20 --> 00:59:13.68 Yeah, there's a ton of risk.
00:59:13.68 --> 00:59:15.000 That risk did not wait,
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.88 did not wait going to Vietnam and losing.
00:59:16.88 --> 00:59:17.88 And they believed that.
00:59:17.88 --> 00:59:20.36 And they pushed hard against the institution
00:59:20.36 --> 00:59:22.12 to be able to do that.
00:59:22.12 --> 00:59:24.28 Yeah, and you know, the last podcast,
00:59:24.28 --> 00:59:26.68 we were talking about,
00:59:26.68 --> 00:59:28.60 I was talking about the 80s and the 90s.
00:59:28.60 --> 00:59:32.04 And look, when you're in,
00:59:32.04 --> 00:59:33.28 when it's the 80s and the 90s,
00:59:33.28 --> 00:59:35.88 and you've been tasked to do the best you can
00:59:35.88 --> 00:59:39.40 to maintain the spirit of going to war.
00:59:39.40 --> 00:59:42.88 But think of how hard the pushback is against pushing
00:59:42.88 --> 00:59:43.88 the envelope and training.
00:59:43.88 --> 00:59:45.48 When you're saying, listen,
00:59:45.48 --> 00:59:47.92 when you've got, we better push the envelope.
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:49.64 Otherwise we're gonna go get killed in Vietnam.
00:59:49.64 --> 00:59:50.80 Yep.
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:56.64 If it's 1994, it's like we better push the envelope.
00:59:56.64 --> 01:00:00.52 Otherwise, then they come back and you say,
01:00:00.52 --> 01:00:01.96 just hey, don't we push the envelope?
01:00:01.96 --> 01:00:02.80 Yeah.
01:00:02.80 --> 01:00:04.52 And it makes, you know, you're like,
01:00:04.52 --> 01:00:05.68 you know, go on it.
01:00:05.68 --> 01:00:06.88 Dude, that was a tough time.
01:00:06.88 --> 01:00:10.24 And if you look at kind of, are, are what we call
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:11.52 the baseline adversary,
01:00:11.52 --> 01:00:13.96 if you think about countries that would be our adversaries
01:00:13.96 --> 01:00:15.96 now, China, Russia.
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:18.56 Those countries were not a threat in 1994.
01:00:18.56 --> 01:00:21.76 They're really, the institution had a really hard time
01:00:21.76 --> 01:00:25.000 being convinced that we needed to train hard.
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.12 It was really, it was a much harder cell.
01:00:27.12 --> 01:00:28.92 Now it's a very different environment.
01:00:28.92 --> 01:00:31.40 And you know, selling the training,
01:00:31.40 --> 01:00:34.84 the demonstrating why we need to do this is actually easier.
01:00:34.84 --> 01:00:38.20 Because back then, it was hard to make a compelling case
01:00:38.20 --> 01:00:40.24 why we needed to push the envelope for what?
01:00:41.24 --> 01:00:44.60 And when you guys would look at doing a mission back then,
01:00:44.60 --> 01:00:46.96 what were you thinking the big mission would be?
01:00:48.12 --> 01:00:52.64 The big mission in 1996, when you were thinking,
01:00:52.64 --> 01:00:55.04 all right, there may be a big mission
01:00:55.04 --> 01:00:56.64 that I need to be ready for.
01:00:56.64 --> 01:00:58.16 I mean, I guess we could look at the,
01:00:58.16 --> 01:00:59.80 the Boclins this time.
01:00:59.80 --> 01:01:04.80 Yeah, so the things in near memory were desert storm
01:01:05.56 --> 01:01:10.56 and multiple, you know, the coast of a former Yugoslavia,
01:01:11.36 --> 01:01:14.48 those there was enough of those in there.
01:01:14.48 --> 01:01:16.84 And there was always this, believe it or not,
01:01:16.84 --> 01:01:20.24 it held over there was always this specter of like,
01:01:20.24 --> 01:01:24.000 you know, great competition, you know, Russia and America,
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.08 those type of things.
01:01:25.08 --> 01:01:26.96 So those are always there.
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:31.12 And there was enough hold over from the kind of the Cold War
01:01:31.12 --> 01:01:32.96 era of leadership, which is the 80s
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:35.60 and you know, very early 90s was,
01:01:35.60 --> 01:01:37.84 hey, this stuff all travels in sign waves
01:01:37.84 --> 01:01:40.24 and sooner or later, what's going to happen
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:43.64 is that there are ability, which is obviously we know that.
01:01:43.64 --> 01:01:46.04 And so that specter of that was always there
01:01:46.04 --> 01:01:48.80 and the proliferation of their stuff all throughout Europe
01:01:48.80 --> 01:01:51.000 and, you know, great great work competition type stuff
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.28 was always part of what we did.
01:01:53.28 --> 01:01:58.28 That makes sense and I guess it probably makes sense to think
01:01:59.68 --> 01:02:03.48 that what it was leaning towards in the teams
01:02:03.48 --> 01:02:06.24 back in those days and probably in, you know,
01:02:06.24 --> 01:02:10.28 in the greater ground troops, the ground forces
01:02:10.28 --> 01:02:13.60 was that these, this idea of like going into a sustained
01:02:13.60 --> 01:02:15.84 ground combat was really,
01:02:16.68 --> 01:02:19.72 that route was really, it seemed like a less likely thing
01:02:19.72 --> 01:02:21.12 all the time, less and less likely
01:02:21.12 --> 01:02:22.76 that we were gonna actually, hey, we're gonna,
01:02:22.76 --> 01:02:26.24 if you would have told me in 1995,
01:02:26.24 --> 01:02:31.24 hey, the US year, the frog men of the 2000s
01:02:33.88 --> 01:02:37.16 and the 2010s are gonna do deployment after deployment,
01:02:37.16 --> 01:02:39.52 after deployment after deployment, after deployment,
01:02:39.52 --> 01:02:42.32 to the desert and they're gonna be fighting
01:02:42.32 --> 01:02:47.32 in ground combat sustained for two decades.
01:02:47.32 --> 01:02:50.88 It would have been very, it would have been hard to predict.
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:55.88 Yeah, but we trained, we trained and then we kept training.
01:02:59.60 --> 01:03:02.12 Next little section, testing a unit's proficiency,
01:03:02.12 --> 01:03:04.32 the chief objective of readiness training is to ensure
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:06.48 that all units are maintained at a high rate
01:03:06.48 --> 01:03:08.88 of operational readiness throughout the year.
01:03:08.88 --> 01:03:11.88 That is that every unit is prepared to carry out
01:03:11.88 --> 01:03:13.60 its combat mission at any time.
01:03:13.60 --> 01:03:15.40 Operational readiness testing to determine
01:03:15.40 --> 01:03:16.32 your unit's operational,
01:03:16.32 --> 01:03:20.28 Teddy, operational readiness, you must provide testing.
01:03:20.28 --> 01:03:23.64 Any kind of talks about what to cover
01:03:23.64 --> 01:03:24.64 is a minimum amount.
01:03:25.84 --> 01:03:27.16 He talks about, you gotta, you know,
01:03:27.16 --> 01:03:29.20 these various abilities, the ability to rendezvous,
01:03:29.20 --> 01:03:30.32 the ability to shoot movement,
01:03:30.32 --> 01:03:32.60 come here, hey, all good.
01:03:32.60 --> 01:03:35.36 And he talks about, for best results,
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:37.52 readiness test should be unannounced,
01:03:37.52 --> 01:03:40.12 which I totally agree with.
01:03:40.12 --> 01:03:42.24 These test should be practical demonstrations
01:03:42.24 --> 01:03:44.80 of how successfully a unit can be expected
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:48.32 to execute all or any part of its emergency mission,
01:03:48.32 --> 01:03:50.56 totally get now.
01:03:50.56 --> 01:03:55.56 Here's where, here's where testing can concern me.
01:03:57.16 --> 01:04:01.36 When we do a test, we kind of have to give,
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:03.32 hey, here's the task condition in standard, right?
01:04:03.32 --> 01:04:04.76 Here's what you're gonna be told to do,
01:04:04.76 --> 01:04:08.72 here's the standard, and here's what you need to do it, right?
01:04:08.72 --> 01:04:10.16 Or sorry, here's the task, right?
01:04:10.16 --> 01:04:11.76 This is what you have to do, here's the conditions
01:04:11.76 --> 01:04:15.48 of that task, and here's the standard that you have to meet.
01:04:15.48 --> 01:04:20.48 I was working with a government agency,
01:04:20.76 --> 01:04:24.08 and one of the tasks of this government agency
01:04:24.08 --> 01:04:28.40 was they had to be able to interdict vessels, small vessels.
01:04:29.60 --> 01:04:32.80 And so in order to interdict these vessels,
01:04:32.80 --> 01:04:37.80 they may have to disable the motor of that vessel.
01:04:38.36 --> 01:04:42.80 And so they had to be able to shoot a weapon
01:04:42.80 --> 01:04:45.12 from a moving vessel that they're in,
01:04:45.12 --> 01:04:47.88 add another moving vessel to disable an engine.
01:04:49.44 --> 01:04:50.72 Okay, got it.
01:04:50.72 --> 01:04:53.72 So over time that became a qualification
01:04:53.72 --> 01:04:56.24 that you had to get, and over time it became a test
01:04:56.24 --> 01:05:00.04 that you had to be able to successfully complete this test,
01:05:00.04 --> 01:05:02.52 in order to maintain this qualification to do it.
01:05:02.52 --> 01:05:04.04 And here's the thing.
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:08.24 One of the guys that had this standard
01:05:08.24 --> 01:05:09.76 was telling me about the test,
01:05:09.76 --> 01:05:11.56 and he was complaining about the test.
01:05:11.56 --> 01:05:13.44 And what had happened was this test,
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:15.64 the task condition in standards,
01:05:16.64 --> 01:05:21.32 were so controlled that there was no realism to it whatsoever.
01:05:21.32 --> 01:05:26.08 And it was okay, the target vessel will have
01:05:26.08 --> 01:05:29.44 a target on that vessel that is whatever,
01:05:29.44 --> 01:05:31.64 three feet by three feet,
01:05:31.64 --> 01:05:35.76 the vessel will be moving in XC state,
01:05:35.76 --> 01:05:36.84 which was no waves,
01:05:36.84 --> 01:05:38.72 they basically would do only do it
01:05:38.72 --> 01:05:40.96 if there was no waves happening whatsoever.
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:43.92 And it will be moving at five knots,
01:05:43.92 --> 01:05:47.64 and the assault vessel will also be moving at five knots.
01:05:47.64 --> 01:05:50.28 The distance will be 14 feet,
01:05:50.28 --> 01:05:51.52 and it was just this whole thing.
01:05:51.52 --> 01:05:54.44 And so basically, it took zero skill to do it.
01:05:54.44 --> 01:05:55.80 It took zero skill,
01:05:55.80 --> 01:06:00.80 it was basically a 20 foot shot at a nice big target,
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:02.52 and it didn't prove anything.
01:06:02.52 --> 01:06:04.60 With the reality of shooting an engine,
01:06:04.60 --> 01:06:06.96 to get an engine to go down on an outboard motor,
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:08.68 it's a pretty tough thing, it's C state at night.
01:06:08.68 --> 01:06:09.96 There's a lot of things going on.
01:06:09.96 --> 01:06:12.96 And by the way, what weapons do you have?
01:06:12.96 --> 01:06:16.12 Because if you have, if you've got a laser on your weapon
01:06:16.12 --> 01:06:17.64 and it's at night, you've got night vision on,
01:06:17.64 --> 01:06:19.24 and you can train your laser on that
01:06:19.24 --> 01:06:20.72 and you're at a C state and you can keep it steady,
01:06:20.72 --> 01:06:22.44 you can fire a few rounds, cool.
01:06:23.76 --> 01:06:26.12 I worry about testing sometimes,
01:06:26.12 --> 01:06:29.16 because when you put tasks, conditions and standards,
01:06:29.16 --> 01:06:30.64 so that you can provide a test,
01:06:30.64 --> 01:06:34.40 oftentimes those restrict the environment
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:36.56 and they make it canned.
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:41.56 And when things become canned, you're not testing
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:43.28 on what you want to test on.
01:06:43.28 --> 01:06:44.60 So I would always, you know,
01:06:44.60 --> 01:06:48.52 sort of have testing things, then I'd have the real test.
01:06:48.52 --> 01:06:51.20 You know, which is gonna be me, I'm,
01:06:51.20 --> 01:06:53.20 it's gonna be me, I'm, and that's what we wanna see.
01:06:53.20 --> 01:06:54.48 How do you handle the me, I'm?
01:06:55.84 --> 01:06:58.76 When you have night vision on and a laser,
01:07:00.64 --> 01:07:03.80 if you don't have night vision on, can you still see that laser?
01:07:03.80 --> 01:07:05.56 There's lasers that you can see,
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:07.44 and there's lasers that you cannot see.
01:07:07.44 --> 01:07:10.20 So you could have a laser without night vision,
01:07:10.20 --> 01:07:12.24 that's a red laser, it's like what you see in the movies.
01:07:12.24 --> 01:07:14.000 Are you familiar with movies?
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.28 Oh yeah, come on later, one.
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:19.32 So you get laser where you, where you can see the little red dot?
01:07:19.32 --> 01:07:20.16 Yes sir.
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:21.000 That's a visible laser.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.40 There's also IR lasers in for red lasers
01:07:23.40 --> 01:07:25.40 that you can't see without night vision on,
01:07:25.40 --> 01:07:29.72 but with night vision on, it's, it's actually insanely bright
01:07:29.72 --> 01:07:30.56 and clear.
01:07:30.56 --> 01:07:33.68 And then they have something that's an IR flood,
01:07:33.68 --> 01:07:36.60 which so you can actually are lighting up the entire target area
01:07:36.60 --> 01:07:38.56 with, so it's illuminated,
01:07:38.56 --> 01:07:41.24 and then there's a laser right in the center of it.
01:07:41.24 --> 01:07:43.72 And then you can see that without goggles.
01:07:43.72 --> 01:07:45.16 Nope, you need goggles.
01:07:45.16 --> 01:07:47.60 The equivalent to that would be just a regular flashlight,
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:49.88 which we also have where you press a button
01:07:49.88 --> 01:07:51.80 and a flashlight comes on, and in the center
01:07:51.80 --> 01:07:53.04 of that flashlight there's a red laser.
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:54.04 Gotcha.
01:07:54.04 --> 01:07:55.04 Okay, so I'll do it.
01:07:55.04 --> 01:07:56.92 Okay, you have all of that in your life.
01:07:56.92 --> 01:07:59.52 You have all that, you have all that on your weapon all the time.
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:00.36 Oh dang, okay.
01:08:00.36 --> 01:08:01.20 So the whole deal.
01:08:01.20 --> 01:08:03.96 That's why when you see guys weapons now,
01:08:03.96 --> 01:08:05.32 it gets too hot, it's too hot.
01:08:05.32 --> 01:08:07.48 There's a lot of stuff going on on weapons.
01:08:07.48 --> 01:08:08.44 I did get better, you know,
01:08:08.44 --> 01:08:10.16 because all these little pieces are getting smaller
01:08:10.16 --> 01:08:12.56 and they're consolidating some of these pieces,
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:15.32 so it's one piece instead of three different pieces.
01:08:15.32 --> 01:08:18.52 You know, now you can get like a grip
01:08:18.52 --> 01:08:22.20 that has a white light and a red laser in it.
01:08:22.20 --> 01:08:23.28 And the batteries.
01:08:23.28 --> 01:08:25.04 There was a time where you had the battery thing
01:08:25.04 --> 01:08:26.40 and then you had the laser thing
01:08:26.40 --> 01:08:28.24 and then you had a battery for the flashlight thing
01:08:28.24 --> 01:08:30.08 and you're gonna wires going all over the place.
01:08:30.08 --> 01:08:31.40 There's a total of gut check.
01:08:31.40 --> 01:08:34.72 Now it is, people are making stuff more square away.
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:36.20 What about that one?
01:08:36.20 --> 01:08:37.44 You know, the ones that,
01:08:38.88 --> 01:08:41.04 like you could see the laser through the little lens
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:42.32 almost kind of thing, you know?
01:08:42.32 --> 01:08:43.80 So that's like, or you can see the dots.
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:44.64 You could see the dots.
01:08:44.64 --> 01:08:45.48 Yep, yep.
01:08:45.48 --> 01:08:47.28 That's just another type of system.
01:08:47.28 --> 01:08:50.08 And the enemy is not gonna be able to see that.
01:08:50.08 --> 01:08:51.48 But you guys don't have those.
01:08:51.48 --> 01:08:52.48 No, we have those too.
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:53.32 On the deal.
01:08:53.32 --> 01:08:54.16 Okay.
01:08:54.16 --> 01:08:55.000 And the team's got everything.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.84 It's pretty awesome.
01:08:55.84 --> 01:08:57.48 Actually, what guys are doing now,
01:08:57.48 --> 01:08:58.48 that's really cool,
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:01.000 because it's sort of getting next level,
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000 the way that the technology is just really getting
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.24 so much better right now.
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:08.08 High speed.
01:09:08.08 --> 01:09:09.36 Yeah, it's getting way more high speed
01:09:09.36 --> 01:09:12.40 and the guys systems are much better than they were,
01:09:12.40 --> 01:09:13.40 you know?
01:09:13.40 --> 01:09:18.40 I mean, the changes that took place
01:09:18.40 --> 01:09:23.40 from Vietnam to 1995 is tiny.
01:09:25.64 --> 01:09:28.44 Compared to the changes that took place last year.
01:09:28.44 --> 01:09:30.88 You know, this is exponentially better
01:09:30.88 --> 01:09:31.72 weapon systems.
01:09:31.72 --> 01:09:33.72 And not so much the weapon system,
01:09:33.72 --> 01:09:37.40 but the accoutrements that you put on the weapon systems
01:09:37.40 --> 01:09:39.32 are way better.
01:09:39.32 --> 01:09:42.68 I mean, I get kind of crazy when I'm watching
01:09:42.68 --> 01:09:44.76 like some of the new technologies coming out of the awesome,
01:09:44.76 --> 01:09:45.60 awesome to see.
01:09:48.96 --> 01:09:51.84 Next little section is, and by the way,
01:09:51.84 --> 01:09:54.52 just I skipped the, you were wondering, Dave,
01:09:54.52 --> 01:09:56.08 I told you I was gonna skip some stuff.
01:09:56.08 --> 01:09:58.80 The stuff that I skipped really goes into like,
01:09:58.80 --> 01:10:03.80 the details of each and every type of unit
01:10:04.36 --> 01:10:05.36 that you can be working with.
01:10:05.36 --> 01:10:08.56 And it goes into some very granular detail,
01:10:08.56 --> 01:10:10.04 good for a military leader,
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:13.36 but a little bit too granular
01:10:13.36 --> 01:10:15.76 for general public consumption.
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:18.56 And I haven't actually started the execution
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:20.12 of publishing this thing on my own.
01:10:20.12 --> 01:10:21.72 I'm obviously gonna need to.
01:10:21.72 --> 01:10:24.52 This needs to be a jockel publishing book.
01:10:24.52 --> 01:10:29.52 So I gotta, I guess I gotta figure out the legality that.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.52 I think the legality is none.
01:10:32.52 --> 01:10:34.28 I think it's more than 50 years old,
01:10:34.28 --> 01:10:36.12 which means it's public domain.
01:10:36.12 --> 01:10:38.44 So I'll write a little forward to it.
01:10:39.76 --> 01:10:41.36 And we'll go from there.
01:10:41.36 --> 01:10:42.36 Go Dave.
01:10:42.36 --> 01:10:45.20 Yeah, I was writing a note that maybe I'll write the forward.
01:10:45.20 --> 01:10:48.44 The cool thing about the theme of this
01:10:48.44 --> 01:10:53.20 is that you've traced this back to the influence on you
01:10:53.20 --> 01:10:56.64 and the influence of the influencer on you.
01:10:56.64 --> 01:10:58.64 Well, there's now another layer here.
01:10:58.64 --> 01:11:03.64 Oh, one more layer deep of where we are all pulling this from,
01:11:03.64 --> 01:11:05.60 which is you recounting where you pulled it from.
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:07.28 And now you're actually connected to where
01:11:07.28 --> 01:11:08.20 hack pulled it from.
01:11:08.20 --> 01:11:10.96 So, check.
01:11:10.96 --> 01:11:13.24 All right, sounds like the next jockel publishing book
01:11:13.24 --> 01:11:16.04 has been delineated.
01:11:16.04 --> 01:11:17.08 You know what's interesting?
01:11:17.08 --> 01:11:19.20 So the name of this and I brought this up already,
01:11:19.20 --> 01:11:22.32 but it's a stack poll publications.
01:11:22.32 --> 01:11:25.28 And by the way, stack poll publications, you're welcome,
01:11:25.28 --> 01:11:28.12 because I know I've read books from you that you publish.
01:11:28.12 --> 01:11:31.000 One of them I know is another clay pledge in St.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.48 Low, which we've covered a long time ago,
01:11:32.48 --> 01:11:35.28 to Glover John's which, by the way, is another connection
01:11:35.28 --> 01:11:37.76 back to Hackworth.
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:38.80 And I talked about it.
01:11:38.80 --> 01:11:42.08 I'm pretty sure some copies of this clay
01:11:42.08 --> 01:11:43.68 pages in St. Low's sold.
01:11:43.68 --> 01:11:46.48 I wrote stack poll books in email.
01:11:46.48 --> 01:11:47.64 And said, hey, I'm here.
01:11:47.64 --> 01:11:48.48 Here's a book.
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:49.16 I'm trying to find.
01:11:49.16 --> 01:11:52.28 I haven't been able to find it.
01:11:52.28 --> 01:11:56.20 I love to do something right-of-forward,
01:11:56.20 --> 01:11:59.000 you know, republish this thing, whatever.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.36 Never heard back from them, unfortunately.
01:12:01.36 --> 01:12:04.28 You know, I probably, I don't think I was persistent enough.
01:12:04.28 --> 01:12:06.28 I probably said I'm one, maybe two emails.
01:12:06.28 --> 01:12:08.08 So I probably should have done a better job
01:12:08.08 --> 01:12:12.20 and explain to them maybe better where I was coming from.
01:12:12.20 --> 01:12:15.72 Didn't do a good enough job, but hopefully,
01:12:15.72 --> 01:12:17.96 we'll do something with it.
01:12:17.96 --> 01:12:22.96 So back to this training for contingency operations.
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:25.56 In addition to being prepared to execute combat missions
01:12:25.56 --> 01:12:27.40 as part of a combined force, units overseas
01:12:27.40 --> 01:12:29.48 must be trained and ready to perform a wide variety
01:12:29.48 --> 01:12:30.84 of contingency operations.
01:12:30.84 --> 01:12:33.24 It is not possible to identify all contingencies
01:12:33.24 --> 01:12:36.000 which may face Army unit stations overseas.
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.96 Generally, a unit that is well trained
01:12:37.96 --> 01:12:41.000 for its basic combat mission will be capable
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000 of supporting contingency operations.
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000 Commanders must be aware, however,
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.40 that their troops may be employed in areas
01:12:47.40 --> 01:12:49.36 where the weather and terrain differ greatly
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:52.24 from that found in areas in which their station.
01:12:52.24 --> 01:12:55.04 Combat ready elements should be air transportable
01:12:55.04 --> 01:12:57.24 for movement on short, notice to potential trouble areas.
01:12:57.24 --> 01:12:59.76 They should be trained to quail civil disturbances,
01:12:59.76 --> 01:13:03.56 control riots, guard or recover critical installations,
01:13:03.56 --> 01:13:08.000 bolster civil authorities and police provide emergency relief
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.48 from natural disasters and handle numerous other related tasks.
01:13:13.96 --> 01:13:15.64 And imagine Commander can visualize
01:13:15.64 --> 01:13:18.08 appropriate and feasible contingency missions for as unit
01:13:18.08 --> 01:13:20.96 and present it with appropriate training situations.
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:23.24 Now, here's something that I'll throw in there.
01:13:23.24 --> 01:13:26.12 It says such training will provide variety
01:13:26.12 --> 01:13:27.76 but must be based on logical conditions.
01:13:27.76 --> 01:13:28.92 It'd be realistic.
01:13:28.92 --> 01:13:30.36 The thing that I'll throw in there is,
01:13:31.52 --> 01:13:34.80 since you don't know what these contingencies are,
01:13:34.80 --> 01:13:36.64 you have to train people on what to do
01:13:36.64 --> 01:13:38.32 and they don't know what to do.
01:13:39.28 --> 01:13:41.08 How do you assess a situation?
01:13:41.08 --> 01:13:42.12 How do you look at it?
01:13:42.12 --> 01:13:44.04 How do you look at it with an open mind?
01:13:44.04 --> 01:13:48.80 And that's one of the real benefits of I had
01:13:48.80 --> 01:13:51.64 of growing up in the seal teams is we've lacked doctrine.
01:13:51.64 --> 01:13:53.88 We have more now, man, when I grew,
01:13:53.88 --> 01:13:55.48 when I was got in the teams, there was no,
01:13:55.48 --> 01:13:58.16 there's almost no, there's all word amount.
01:13:58.16 --> 01:14:01.96 And so when you got told, hey, you're going to do this type
01:14:01.96 --> 01:14:04.24 of mission, you just got told word amount of how you're going
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:04.80 to do it.
01:14:04.80 --> 01:14:06.56 And if it was a type of mission that no one had ever done
01:14:06.56 --> 01:14:08.48 before, we were going to sit there and make up how to do it.
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:10.72 There was no book to refer to.
01:14:10.72 --> 01:14:14.68 We didn't, and we didn't have, I'll tell you what, we didn't have
01:14:14.68 --> 01:14:16.80 in 1995.
01:14:18.64 --> 01:14:22.76 No one ever said to me, hey, we're doing an assault.
01:14:22.76 --> 01:14:25.40 Here's the army manual of what they do.
01:14:25.40 --> 01:14:26.24 No one ever said that.
01:14:26.24 --> 01:14:31.24 I never saw an army manual in the teams in the 90s.
01:14:33.24 --> 01:14:34.56 It was all word amount.
01:14:37.36 --> 01:14:40.52 So you had to, you have to put people in situations
01:14:40.52 --> 01:14:42.60 where you go, hey, hey, they's a random mission figure out
01:14:42.60 --> 01:14:44.68 how you're going to do this.
01:14:44.68 --> 01:14:45.76 Figure out how you're going to do this.
01:14:45.76 --> 01:14:48.76 And then you see what they do.
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:50.92 And there are protocols for what to do when you don't know
01:14:50.92 --> 01:14:51.44 what to do.
01:14:55.44 --> 01:14:59.04 Then it gets into this section right here, which is,
01:14:59.04 --> 01:15:00.28 I was like, oh, maybe I'll skip this.
01:15:00.28 --> 01:15:01.48 And then I read like four lines.
01:15:01.48 --> 01:15:03.92 I'm like, all right, this is freaking awesome.
01:15:03.92 --> 01:15:08.92 So guidelines for planning, brigade, and battalion attacks.
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:17.56 Training, regardless of size of unit has but one purpose.
01:15:18.32 --> 01:15:22.28 That is to teach effectively the techniques of combat.
01:15:22.28 --> 01:15:26.16 The attack is the key to success.
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:29.40 The defense is merely a temporary expedient
01:15:29.40 --> 01:15:33.04 to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere
01:15:33.04 --> 01:15:35.72 or to prepare for an attack at a future date.
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:38.72 So the only reason you're going on defense
01:15:38.72 --> 01:15:40.92 is so that you can go back on the attack.
01:15:40.92 --> 01:15:42.08 That's the only reason you're going,
01:15:42.08 --> 01:15:43.32 everything is to attack.
01:15:43.32 --> 01:15:44.16 That's all you're doing.
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:45.48 You're going to attack.
01:15:45.48 --> 01:15:46.52 Oh, we got to hesitate, cool.
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:48.28 Where has dating so that we can attack later?
01:15:49.84 --> 01:15:50.68 That's what we're doing.
01:15:50.68 --> 01:15:52.36 We're going to attack.
01:15:52.36 --> 01:15:54.24 The consequences of having an attack
01:15:54.24 --> 01:15:56.16 grind to a halt are great.
01:15:56.16 --> 01:15:59.36 The effort required for it to bounce back is tremendous.
01:15:59.36 --> 01:16:00.64 Once an attack is launched,
01:16:00.64 --> 01:16:03.20 its momentum must be maintained until the objective
01:16:03.20 --> 01:16:05.44 or objectives are seized and secured.
01:16:05.44 --> 01:16:07.92 Battle losses received due to poor planning
01:16:07.92 --> 01:16:10.36 and faulty execution are inexcusable
01:16:10.36 --> 01:16:13.68 and will result in a loss of respect for and confidence
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:14.76 in the commander.
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:18.92 The best reputation a commander can have
01:16:18.92 --> 01:16:23.20 is that he accomplishes his missions with few losses.
01:16:26.56 --> 01:16:29.32 The end sought in planning and executing
01:16:29.32 --> 01:16:32.04 an attack is brought about by deliberate planning
01:16:32.04 --> 01:16:34.44 and violent execution.
01:16:34.44 --> 01:16:36.80 The opposite is fatal.
01:16:38.12 --> 01:16:40.52 Speed and planning is often needed,
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:43.04 but haste should be avoided.
01:16:44.04 --> 01:16:46.88 Remember that in combat, there is no second opportunity
01:16:46.88 --> 01:16:49.20 and seldom opportunity for rehearsals.
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:52.16 This deliberate planning is accomplished in five phases.
01:16:53.96 --> 01:16:56.44 Phase one, basic factors, principal factors,
01:16:56.44 --> 01:16:58.32 which must be considered by a commander
01:16:58.32 --> 01:17:00.60 in deliberate planning are mission.
01:17:00.60 --> 01:17:04.04 Enemy situation troops available, terrain and weather.
01:17:04.04 --> 01:17:06.16 This is something we all learn basic,
01:17:06.16 --> 01:17:08.76 mission enemy troops available, terrain and weather.
01:17:08.76 --> 01:17:11.04 Phase two, tentative plan of attack.
01:17:12.12 --> 01:17:14.72 How much time do I support it and I have
01:17:14.72 --> 01:17:17.40 for reconnaissance planning and the issuance of order?
01:17:17.40 --> 01:17:19.40 What general scheme and maneuver do I want to employ?
01:17:19.40 --> 01:17:20.84 What formations are feasible?
01:17:20.84 --> 01:17:22.48 What does the mobility of my command?
01:17:22.48 --> 01:17:24.20 How much dispersing can I achieve
01:17:24.20 --> 01:17:27.20 and still accomplish my mission with speed and violence?
01:17:27.20 --> 01:17:30.84 What supporting nuclear fires are planned for
01:17:30.84 --> 01:17:35.36 or are available to me and for adjacent units?
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:36.04 We're not got to that.
01:17:36.04 --> 01:17:37.56 I'm thinking, wow.
01:17:39.16 --> 01:17:40.32 Wow.
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:44.60 This is, I think this book is 1962, 1963.
01:17:44.60 --> 01:17:47.80 This is like it's on cold war.
01:17:47.80 --> 01:17:49.04 And we're thinking if I,
01:17:49.04 --> 01:17:50.96 if I'm gonna do an attack, you know what?
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:53.84 We may bring in some tactical nukes.
01:17:53.84 --> 01:17:59.44 That's where we're at. So these guys are planning
01:17:59.44 --> 01:18:02.000 and thinking and thinking through using
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.52 nuclear weapons on the battlefield.
01:18:07.20 --> 01:18:09.36 How can I employ my conventional fire support?
01:18:09.36 --> 01:18:11.000 That's a secondary thought by the way,
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.84 my primary is going nuke.
01:18:12.84 --> 01:18:14.56 What logistical problems problems do I have?
01:18:14.56 --> 01:18:16.52 Can I support the operation logistically?
01:18:16.52 --> 01:18:18.48 What is the status of personnel and equipment?
01:18:18.48 --> 01:18:21.24 How can I best use my supporting elements to include armor?
01:18:21.24 --> 01:18:23.72 Per armor personnel carriers and helicopters?
01:18:23.72 --> 01:18:26.000 Our communication facilities at adequate.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.76 Can I communicate with my supporting units?
01:18:27.76 --> 01:18:29.64 Do their radio is net with mine?
01:18:29.64 --> 01:18:31.72 What flank security problems do I have?
01:18:31.72 --> 01:18:33.84 How can I best control the attack?
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:34.76 From where?
01:18:34.76 --> 01:18:36.16 What control measures?
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:38.44 What must I be ready to do next when I have seized
01:18:38.44 --> 01:18:40.000 and secured the objective?
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:43.84 So that's that right there.
01:18:43.84 --> 01:18:46.32 That was the tentative plan of attack.
01:18:47.24 --> 01:18:49.000 And then it goes detail plan of attack,
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.60 having analyzed these factors and having developed
01:18:51.60 --> 01:18:53.64 a tentative plan based on this analysis,
01:18:53.64 --> 01:18:55.80 the commanders ready to get down to details.
01:18:55.80 --> 01:18:57.92 These things must then be considered.
01:18:57.92 --> 01:19:00.68 What is the formation that we will be initially used?
01:19:00.68 --> 01:19:02.56 Mounted dismounted or by helicopter?
01:19:02.56 --> 01:19:04.16 What units will be in the initial attack?
01:19:04.16 --> 01:19:08.000 What units are being supporting or in reserve?
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.92 What will constitute my base of fire?
01:19:09.92 --> 01:19:11.72 Because it's all covered move.
01:19:11.72 --> 01:19:12.76 We're going to have a base of fire,
01:19:12.76 --> 01:19:15.60 we're going to have an element maneuvering.
01:19:15.60 --> 01:19:19.24 We'll forward assembly areas or attack positions
01:19:19.24 --> 01:19:21.44 be used for my attacking troops.
01:19:21.44 --> 01:19:22.40 If so, where?
01:19:22.40 --> 01:19:26.64 When will my components of my fire support start?
01:19:26.64 --> 01:19:27.96 When will we ship fire and stop?
01:19:27.96 --> 01:19:29.16 How will I range for this to happen?
01:19:29.16 --> 01:19:32.72 How can I exploit the effects of my supporting nuclear fires?
01:19:34.52 --> 01:19:37.64 Oh, it's so crazy to think about.
01:19:37.64 --> 01:19:38.48 Yeah.
01:19:42.04 --> 01:19:45.12 From what position will each of my attacking elements
01:19:45.12 --> 01:19:49.92 start their attacking by fire and maneuver?
01:19:49.92 --> 01:19:51.000 Cover and move.
01:19:52.16 --> 01:19:54.16 This is the true line of departure
01:19:54.16 --> 01:19:55.84 and should be considered as such.
01:19:55.84 --> 01:19:56.84 That's an LD.
01:19:58.04 --> 01:20:01.24 There may be other courting lines or points in there.
01:20:01.24 --> 01:20:04.68 How and from what distance will I start a coordinated assault?
01:20:04.68 --> 01:20:07.64 What command signal and contingent will I use to start it?
01:20:07.64 --> 01:20:10.16 What reports will I expect from my subordinate units?
01:20:10.16 --> 01:20:12.08 What reports will I give to my superiors?
01:20:12.08 --> 01:20:14.52 With whom should I establish liaison?
01:20:14.52 --> 01:20:18.96 How when and where should I issue my attack order?
01:20:18.96 --> 01:20:21.56 What arrangements should I make for this?
01:20:21.56 --> 01:20:23.04 And then it gets into the war gaming.
01:20:23.04 --> 01:20:24.64 So the reason I'm going through this is like,
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:25.96 think of the level of detail.
01:20:25.96 --> 01:20:28.12 Think of the, you know, I got that section of discipline
01:20:28.12 --> 01:20:28.96 equals freedom field man.
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:30.12 Or I was like, question everything.
01:20:30.12 --> 01:20:31.76 This is it, man.
01:20:31.76 --> 01:20:33.16 What are we doing?
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:34.60 How are we doing it?
01:20:34.60 --> 01:20:36.52 Having a checklist like this to think about
01:20:36.52 --> 01:20:38.76 before you conduct an operation?
01:20:38.76 --> 01:20:39.88 I don't care if you're at a business.
01:20:39.88 --> 01:20:41.12 I don't care if you're going to grocery store.
01:20:41.12 --> 01:20:44.48 Thinking about what you're going to be facing.
01:20:44.48 --> 01:20:47.48 This is a smart way to operate.
01:20:50.88 --> 01:20:54.08 Phase four, war gaming the plan.
01:20:55.12 --> 01:20:57.64 The commander now having come to a pretty firm idea
01:20:57.64 --> 01:20:59.60 of what he wants to do and how he wants to do it.
01:20:59.60 --> 01:21:01.48 Now war games it in his mind
01:21:01.48 --> 01:21:03.72 and ask himself the following questions.
01:21:04.76 --> 01:21:07.32 This is when you're trying to punch holes in your own plan
01:21:07.32 --> 01:21:08.80 to the maximum extent possible.
01:21:08.80 --> 01:21:10.48 Have I based my plan on knowledge,
01:21:10.48 --> 01:21:13.48 gain through active ground, map,
01:21:13.48 --> 01:21:17.08 and aerial reconnaissance and knowledge of the enemy situation?
01:21:18.08 --> 01:21:20.68 Have I analyzed the enemy defense thoroughly
01:21:20.68 --> 01:21:23.28 thereby locating and taking advantage of weaknesses
01:21:23.28 --> 01:21:25.68 in enemy disposition or terrain
01:21:25.68 --> 01:21:27.48 where the defender cannot use his weapons
01:21:27.48 --> 01:21:29.68 or obstacles to advantage?
01:21:29.68 --> 01:21:32.08 Have I given adequate consideration to terrain
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:34.28 and whether one affects the have on the accomplishment
01:21:34.28 --> 01:21:34.88 of my mission?
01:21:34.88 --> 01:21:37.08 Have I planned for maximum exploitation
01:21:37.08 --> 01:21:38.88 of available nuclear fires?
01:21:39.88 --> 01:21:42.48 Have I considered troop safety in the planning
01:21:42.48 --> 01:21:45.28 of my nuclear fires and scheme of maneuver?
01:21:45.28 --> 01:21:47.88 Have I considered the use of armored personnel carriers?
01:21:47.88 --> 01:21:50.08 Have I considered the effects of nuclear weapons
01:21:50.08 --> 01:21:52.68 upon the terrain over which I am attacking?
01:21:52.68 --> 01:21:57.08 Blowdown contaminated areas, secondary fires.
01:21:58.68 --> 01:22:00.28 I didn't know what blowdown was.
01:22:00.28 --> 01:22:01.88 I had to look it up, guess where I went.
01:22:01.88 --> 01:22:06.88 I went to FM 100, attack 30 nuclear operations.
01:22:06.88 --> 01:22:07.68 What is it?
01:22:07.68 --> 01:22:11.88 Blowdown is when trees get blown down
01:22:11.88 --> 01:22:15.48 and they're splintered and they create just obstacles
01:22:15.48 --> 01:22:17.28 everywhere, they're very hard to move through.
01:22:17.28 --> 01:22:19.88 So you got to account for that in your assault.
01:22:19.88 --> 01:22:22.88 Got to account for the blowdown of the nuclear weapons
01:22:22.88 --> 01:22:25.08 you used to prep the area for assault?
01:22:28.28 --> 01:22:29.08 Man.
01:22:30.48 --> 01:22:33.68 Have I provided for full shock effect on the enemy?
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:35.68 This comes from surprise tanks and strengths,
01:22:35.68 --> 01:22:37.08 attacks from several directions,
01:22:37.08 --> 01:22:39.48 simultaneously intensity of supporting fires
01:22:39.48 --> 01:22:41.48 during the assault and the speed of the assault
01:22:41.48 --> 01:22:44.08 by use of armored personnel carriers and helicopters.
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:47.08 Does my plan provide for the waiting of the main effort?
01:22:47.08 --> 01:22:50.28 Have I used attacking units as a base of fire
01:22:50.28 --> 01:22:54.28 when I have artillery heavy weapons and mortars for this purpose?
01:22:54.28 --> 01:22:56.48 Isn't it crazy that everything is covered move?
01:22:56.48 --> 01:22:59.08 Everything is covered move.
01:22:59.08 --> 01:23:01.28 The use of tanks for this purpose is especially
01:23:01.28 --> 01:23:03.68 faulty if the tanks could be used in the attack role
01:23:03.68 --> 01:23:06.68 to close with the enemy and overrun them.
01:23:06.68 --> 01:23:11.08 Has the excessive use of attack troops as a base of fire
01:23:11.08 --> 01:23:14.88 as reserves or as reconnaissance and security elements
01:23:14.88 --> 01:23:18.68 cause me to have two little strength in the attack?
01:23:18.68 --> 01:23:23.88 Have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives?
01:23:23.88 --> 01:23:26.08 Which, I don't want to go back to number 10.
01:23:26.08 --> 01:23:27.48 Here.
01:23:28.68 --> 01:23:33.08 Have I used too much of the attack troops in the base of fire?
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:35.48 So when you have, would be doing assaults,
01:23:35.48 --> 01:23:41.48 like let's say it's a basic seal platoon in the 90s.
01:23:41.48 --> 01:23:43.08 And we'd be doing an assault.
01:23:43.08 --> 01:23:46.48 And so you have a base of fire and then you have an assault element.
01:23:46.48 --> 01:23:50.08 And you could say, okay, squad one,
01:23:50.08 --> 01:23:51.88 you're going to be the base element squad two.
01:23:51.88 --> 01:23:54.08 You're going to be the assault element.
01:23:54.08 --> 01:23:57.28 So squad one, you're going to lay down this base of fire.
01:23:57.28 --> 01:23:59.28 And while you're laying down that base of fire,
01:23:59.28 --> 01:24:01.88 in comes the maneuver element, the assault element
01:24:01.88 --> 01:24:03.48 is going to move into position.
01:24:03.48 --> 01:24:05.28 And then they're going to start going through the target
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:08.08 and then the base of fire is going to shift off the target.
01:24:08.08 --> 01:24:09.68 But they've suppressed the enemy fire
01:24:09.68 --> 01:24:11.08 and now you can go through pretty clean.
01:24:11.08 --> 01:24:13.08 So there's a tendency to think, well,
01:24:13.08 --> 01:24:14.68 you don't have to have this base of fire.
01:24:14.68 --> 01:24:19.88 Why don't I take my machine gunners from squad two
01:24:19.88 --> 01:24:21.88 and put them in the base element.
01:24:21.88 --> 01:24:23.88 So then they have massive fire power.
01:24:23.88 --> 01:24:25.88 And plus that means the assault element's a little bit lighter.
01:24:25.88 --> 01:24:27.08 They can move a little bit quicker.
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:28.08 And we're good.
01:24:29.28 --> 01:24:31.88 And I remember sitting in a platoon brief
01:24:31.88 --> 01:24:33.28 and we were going to do that.
01:24:33.28 --> 01:24:35.88 And wasn't my plan. I was like a new guy.
01:24:35.88 --> 01:24:36.88 Literally a new guy.
01:24:36.88 --> 01:24:38.28 I was just sitting there going,
01:24:38.28 --> 01:24:39.68 okay, tell me what to do.
01:24:40.88 --> 01:24:42.68 And the plan got briefed.
01:24:42.68 --> 01:24:45.28 Hey, okay, this is how we're going to task organized
01:24:45.28 --> 01:24:46.08 for this assault.
01:24:46.08 --> 01:24:48.28 We're going to put all the machine gunners.
01:24:48.28 --> 01:24:51.48 So four machine gunners in the base element.
01:24:51.48 --> 01:24:53.28 And so we're going to have this massive fire power.
01:24:53.28 --> 01:24:57.28 And then these other guys, the point man from the squad one
01:24:57.28 --> 01:24:59.28 and the rear security from squad one
01:24:59.28 --> 01:25:00.68 and whatever one of the corpsmen from squad
01:25:00.68 --> 01:25:03.08 they're going to go down and they're going to go through the assault element.
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:07.08 And so then the old master chief says,
01:25:07.08 --> 01:25:11.48 well, what if what if the assault element gets compromised?
01:25:11.48 --> 01:25:13.68 They got no machine guns.
01:25:13.68 --> 01:25:18.08 What if the base element wants the assault element gets compromised
01:25:18.08 --> 01:25:20.08 and starts to engage the target?
01:25:20.08 --> 01:25:23.08 What happens if now they have to go on the assault?
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:27.68 And now the base of fire is weak from the former assault element.
01:25:27.68 --> 01:25:29.08 So what did that tell me?
01:25:29.08 --> 01:25:31.88 I remember sitting there thinking, okay, you got to be.
01:25:31.88 --> 01:25:33.48 That's a contingency.
01:25:33.48 --> 01:25:36.68 And what you're really doing is you're you're you're you're
01:25:36.68 --> 01:25:40.68 you're giving away so much tactical advantage because not only that,
01:25:40.68 --> 01:25:44.28 a seal puttune squad is meant to work a certain way.
01:25:44.28 --> 01:25:46.08 There's a reason it's designed that way.
01:25:46.08 --> 01:25:47.28 And all of a sudden you mix it all up.
01:25:47.28 --> 01:25:49.28 And now you're now with not really a seal squad anymore.
01:25:49.28 --> 01:25:52.48 They're no freaking machine gunners in it.
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:56.88 What's a seal freaking squad without machine gunners?
01:25:56.88 --> 01:25:59.28 But you've taken those machine gunners away.
01:25:59.28 --> 01:26:04.68 And then you've overly burdened the other one with too many machine gunners.
01:26:04.68 --> 01:26:13.28 So that idea of hey, I'm going to make these adjustments for this particular situation.
01:26:13.28 --> 01:26:17.08 And if everything goes perfect, it's good.
01:26:17.08 --> 01:26:20.88 But if anything changes, it's bad.
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:23.68 What are the chances things are going to go a little bit different?
01:26:23.68 --> 01:26:26.28 The chances are freaking too high.
01:26:26.28 --> 01:26:28.08 And you don't really gain that much.
01:26:28.08 --> 01:26:31.08 There's not really that much of a advantage anyways.
01:26:31.08 --> 01:26:34.28 So that that reminding me of that.
01:26:34.28 --> 01:26:38.88 Next, have I selected unnecessary intermediate objectives, which distract from the attainment
01:26:38.88 --> 01:26:41.08 of the final objective?
01:26:41.08 --> 01:26:44.28 Intermediate objectives facilitate control and maintain direction.
01:26:44.28 --> 01:26:49.48 However, too many such objectives destroy flexibility and initiative and tend to slow up
01:26:49.48 --> 01:26:50.48 the attack.
01:26:50.48 --> 01:26:53.48 Man.
01:26:53.48 --> 01:26:54.48 Man, that's good.
01:26:54.48 --> 01:26:55.48 You know what's good about that?
01:26:55.48 --> 01:26:57.88 I like that because it's contrary to what we all
01:26:57.88 --> 01:26:58.88 say.
01:26:58.88 --> 01:27:02.48 I say, and I'm saying, we not, I'm not just talking about Esslope front.
01:27:02.48 --> 01:27:03.48 You know, people hate what?
01:27:03.48 --> 01:27:04.48 And it makes sense.
01:27:04.48 --> 01:27:05.48 We know it makes sense.
01:27:05.48 --> 01:27:06.88 Hey, we got this big project to do.
01:27:06.88 --> 01:27:10.28 Okay, let's figure out some intermediate steps that we have some short term goals.
01:27:10.28 --> 01:27:11.28 And we can move in that direction.
01:27:11.28 --> 01:27:12.28 And it feels good.
01:27:12.28 --> 01:27:13.28 We get gratification.
01:27:13.28 --> 01:27:15.48 We make sure we're on track.
01:27:15.48 --> 01:27:16.48 There's a big copy.
01:27:16.48 --> 01:27:17.48 Can we go too far with that?
01:27:17.48 --> 01:27:20.28 Yes, we absolutely can.
01:27:20.28 --> 01:27:23.48 Now all of a sudden, we've got goals that we're trying to achieve or doing reports on goals that
01:27:23.48 --> 01:27:25.48 don't even freaking matter.
01:27:25.48 --> 01:27:27.48 Don't let that happen.
01:27:27.48 --> 01:27:31.68 Have I determined the time and space factors of attacking units from the light into
01:27:31.68 --> 01:27:34.24 departure back to the assembly area?
01:27:34.24 --> 01:27:36.20 Have I set the stage for the assault?
01:27:36.20 --> 01:27:40.04 Have I set the light limited or the light into departure too far back?
01:27:40.04 --> 01:27:45.36 Have I used my forward air control or supporting artillery commander, supporting battery,
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:49.80 mortar commander, engineer, put two meter, communications officer, assault, assault, gun
01:27:49.80 --> 01:27:54.80 put two meter, reconnaissance put two meter surgeon and my planning.
01:27:54.80 --> 01:27:58.32 And my staff in planning, checking and completing the detailed plans.
01:27:58.32 --> 01:28:02.72 And I'm kind of breezing through, but that one right there, I'm going to pause.
01:28:02.72 --> 01:28:07.36 So he names off all these different people, all these different professionals.
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:13.96 And then he says, have I used them in planning, checking and completing the details of my
01:28:13.96 --> 01:28:16.36 plans?
01:28:16.36 --> 01:28:19.08 And the reason I want to focus on that, because a bunch of times he talks about, hey, I got
01:28:19.08 --> 01:28:21.44 to give my plan to have I give my plan clearly.
01:28:21.44 --> 01:28:24.72 And what he's saying here is it's not my plan.
01:28:24.72 --> 01:28:29.36 It's the plan of the artillery guy, the mortar guy, the engineer guy, the communications
01:28:29.36 --> 01:28:37.44 guy, the assault guy, the reconnaissance guy, the surgeon, and my staff, it's their plan.
01:28:37.44 --> 01:28:41.48 Have I used them to come up with this plan?
01:28:41.48 --> 01:28:45.44 And if I haven't, then I'm wrong.
01:28:45.44 --> 01:28:49.52 Have I considered the ammunition available to my fire support units?
01:28:49.52 --> 01:28:52.92 Are my supporting fires plans that there will be no laws during critical phase of the attack?
01:28:52.92 --> 01:28:58.60 Have I given consideration the use of nuclear fires?
01:28:58.60 --> 01:29:02.88 To time fire over my tanks, if the tanks are available to smoke, to having my infantry
01:29:02.88 --> 01:29:06.64 follow closely as supporting fires does my plan require holding up any elements during the
01:29:06.64 --> 01:29:09.48 attack to clear barriers or obstacles?
01:29:09.48 --> 01:29:15.60 Does my plan of attack for sea and provide for the next step in case of success, partial
01:29:15.60 --> 01:29:20.44 success, or failure?
01:29:20.44 --> 01:29:24.000 Is this planning?
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.88 But think about that.
01:29:25.88 --> 01:29:28.32 Do I have a plan for success?
01:29:28.32 --> 01:29:29.68 Partial success or failure?
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:31.16 Do I know what I'm going to do?
01:29:31.16 --> 01:29:38.16 Have I given some unit the mission of watching and securing my flanks?
01:29:38.16 --> 01:29:43.12 Have I ensured that after the seizure of the objective, my units have a detailed plan for
01:29:43.12 --> 01:29:47.56 consolidation, reorganization, and continuing the attacks that they will not rest on their
01:29:47.56 --> 01:29:52.92 goals thus exposing themselves to a surprise counter attack and losses from enemy fires or
01:29:52.92 --> 01:29:58.12 the loss of the initiative?
01:29:58.12 --> 01:30:03.80 Just imagine sitting down with your leadership as you assess something that you're going
01:30:03.80 --> 01:30:10.44 to do and trying to come up with this many holes to punch in your own plan.
01:30:10.44 --> 01:30:18.80 If you're not doing this, the holes don't get filled in.
01:30:18.80 --> 01:30:25.36 Having next phases of the attack order, having war game the plan in his mind and being
01:30:25.36 --> 01:30:27.36 satisfied as to his condition.
01:30:27.36 --> 01:30:30.36 I know I'll say this, it's not in his mind as far as I'm concerned.
01:30:30.36 --> 01:30:31.36 I'm getting the staff together.
01:30:31.36 --> 01:30:32.36 We're going to sit there.
01:30:32.36 --> 01:30:34.12 I'm going to have everyone beat this plan up.
01:30:34.12 --> 01:30:35.12 We're going to go through these questions.
01:30:35.12 --> 01:30:37.48 We're going to come up with more questions.
01:30:37.48 --> 01:30:41.64 Having worked game the plan in his mind and being satisfied as to his solution to commander
01:30:41.64 --> 01:30:45.68 then proceeds to the actual issuing of his order, it can be assumed that some time during
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:48.96 the foregoing phases he has in addition considered the following.
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:51.56 He's not even done considering yet.
01:30:51.56 --> 01:30:58.56 I must not take so much time in making my plans and announcing my orders that my subordinate
01:30:58.56 --> 01:31:01.000 have inadequate time before each hour.
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.68 In case of doubt, I will send a staff officer forward to a subordinate commander rather
01:31:04.68 --> 01:31:09.32 than calling him back or hold my conference for issuing orders well for it.
01:31:09.32 --> 01:31:10.32 What does that mean?
01:31:10.32 --> 01:31:12.60 We're taking care of the frontline commander.
01:31:12.60 --> 01:31:16.72 Dude, hey, Dave, I know you're preparing for this right now, but I want you to come
01:31:16.72 --> 01:31:18.92 back to my location so I can brief you.
01:31:18.92 --> 01:31:21.96 No, I'll send a guy out to get you.
01:31:21.96 --> 01:31:25.36 Make sure you know what you need to know.
01:31:25.36 --> 01:31:31.80 In order to avoid misunderstandings and overlooking and important things, I must issue my orders
01:31:31.80 --> 01:31:33.68 in the standard sequence.
01:31:33.68 --> 01:31:39.60 I must make sure that every commander knows what he is to do and win.
01:31:39.60 --> 01:31:47.04 I must impress all with the need for vigorous execution of my plans.
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:54.36 If the answers to all these are satisfactory, you and your units are off to a good start.
01:31:54.36 --> 01:31:57.04 Dude, what?
01:31:57.04 --> 01:31:58.40 What do you like about that?
01:31:58.40 --> 01:32:00.08 If you do all these things.
01:32:00.08 --> 01:32:01.08 Yeah.
01:32:01.08 --> 01:32:03.12 All these things.
01:32:03.12 --> 01:32:04.12 You're off to a good start.
01:32:04.12 --> 01:32:05.12 You're off to a good start.
01:32:05.12 --> 01:32:08.04 You made the first step in the right direction.
01:32:08.04 --> 01:32:13.48 Do not later second guess your decisions and change your orders.
01:32:13.48 --> 01:32:20.72 Now this is one to talk about at least a little bit.
01:32:20.72 --> 01:32:22.64 Are there times when you need to change your orders?
01:32:22.64 --> 01:32:23.64 Absolutely.
01:32:23.64 --> 01:32:27.44 Are there times when new intelligence comes to light and you say to yourself, you know what?
01:32:27.44 --> 01:32:30.28 The plan that I came up with is no longer optimal.
01:32:30.28 --> 01:32:31.72 I need to change it.
01:32:31.72 --> 01:32:32.72 Is that happened?
01:32:32.72 --> 01:32:35.88 Yes.
01:32:35.88 --> 01:32:43.12 Are there times where you, you, some micro change occurs on the battlefield and you decide
01:32:43.12 --> 01:32:50.68 to change plans that's already been rehearsed, fought through and everyone's been briefed.
01:32:50.68 --> 01:32:53.72 And now you're going to throw a curve ball in everybody.
01:32:53.72 --> 01:32:59.56 I can almost guarantee you that you should just, as we used to say in the teams, plan
01:32:59.56 --> 01:33:01.68 your dive and then dive your plan.
01:33:01.68 --> 01:33:05.64 Then you're diving dive so you come up with a plan and then go and execute your plan.
01:33:05.64 --> 01:33:11.32 When you start throwing curve balls and trying to change things on the fly, is actually
01:33:11.32 --> 01:33:14.72 evident, evident, hayford from Black Rifle Coffee.
01:33:14.72 --> 01:33:20.68 I was out doing some archery with him and we were talking about something he goes, yeah,
01:33:20.68 --> 01:33:22.32 yeah, we'll just figure it out under water.
01:33:22.32 --> 01:33:26.000 Which is, which is actually hilarious thing because when you're diving, obviously you can't
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.36 talk, you can't figure anything out under water.
01:33:28.36 --> 01:33:32.80 And surprisingly, I'd never heard that expression before, but it's freaking awesome.
01:33:32.80 --> 01:33:33.80 It's freaking awesome.
01:33:33.80 --> 01:33:35.36 Hey, we'll just figure it out under water.
01:33:35.36 --> 01:33:39.40 Meaning if we let this go, we are screwed.
01:33:39.40 --> 01:33:40.40 We're screwed.
01:33:40.40 --> 01:33:42.24 So you don't want to figure things out under water.
01:33:42.24 --> 01:33:44.44 What you do is you dive your plan.
01:33:44.44 --> 01:33:48.68 This is such a, this is why leadership is hard because there are absolutely times where
01:33:48.68 --> 01:33:50.28 you go, you know what, bad plan.
01:33:50.28 --> 01:33:52.88 We need to change, we need to change it right now.
01:33:52.88 --> 01:33:55.60 We need to change the plan right now.
01:33:55.60 --> 01:33:57.08 That's fine.
01:33:57.08 --> 01:34:00.80 There's also times where you say, you know what, we're close.
01:34:00.80 --> 01:34:08.20 And what we will gain from trying to adjust this plan right now will be the adjustments.
01:34:08.20 --> 01:34:12.84 We'll be so hard to make it this juncture that it's going to counter any positives that
01:34:12.84 --> 01:34:16.76 will come from trying to change these plan right now.
01:34:16.76 --> 01:34:20.20 So you have to be careful of that.
01:34:20.20 --> 01:34:24.000 Don't harass the subordinate commanders while they are planning.
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.64 Make sure you're there orders and getting ready to carry out their assignments.
01:34:28.64 --> 01:34:32.32 You and your staff should make such checks as are needed without violating this.
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:36.60 So other of the frontline troops, once the attack starts, you can influence the battle
01:34:36.60 --> 01:34:39.92 by shifting of supporting fires maneuver and use of your reserves.
01:34:39.92 --> 01:34:41.52 You should be prepared to do this.
01:34:41.52 --> 01:34:47.72 You should now anticipate what may happen so that you will be at the critical spot at the
01:34:47.72 --> 01:34:57.44 critical time to give that command push necessary to keep the attack going.
01:34:57.44 --> 01:35:03.16 Commanders should make planning the attack a subject for schools and table exercises
01:35:03.16 --> 01:35:07.40 and tactical walks or rides for the appropriate officers.
01:35:07.40 --> 01:35:11.40 And man, I know you didn't get a chance to do EF battlefield, which we went out to get
01:35:11.40 --> 01:35:12.40 his bird.
01:35:12.40 --> 01:35:16.04 But that tactical walk that we tend to just, it's freaking awesome.
01:35:16.04 --> 01:35:19.04 It's awesome.
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:25.84 Walking the battlefield and understanding the terrain and seeing it on the ground is absolutely
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84 phenomenal.
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:27.84 Lessons learned are incredible.
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:30.92 I'm going to have Jason and Steve on.
01:35:30.92 --> 01:35:34.24 We're going to talk about that.
01:35:34.24 --> 01:35:41.68 And this is really the last piece and we'll hold off for one more episode.
01:35:41.68 --> 01:35:51.80 One more one more episode for me to fulfill my own personal satisfaction in this book.
01:35:51.80 --> 01:35:57.28 A commander who prepares a checklist from these guidelines will have a great aid in time
01:35:57.28 --> 01:35:58.28 of pressure.
01:35:58.28 --> 01:36:06.44 He will enable him to plan thoroughly with speed instead of haste.
01:36:06.44 --> 01:36:14.20 So speed instead of haste.
01:36:14.20 --> 01:36:16.60 Do essential things first.
01:36:16.60 --> 01:36:19.20 Do things right the first time.
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:25.000 Practice more than one thing at a time.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.24 So many just quotes to think about.
01:36:29.24 --> 01:36:33.000 I think one of the first quotes I sent you in a little picture.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000 The attack is the key to success.
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.56 The defense is merely a temporary expedient to conserve forces for an attack elsewhere, or to
01:36:42.56 --> 01:36:48.12 prepare for an attack at a future date.
01:36:48.12 --> 01:36:49.20 So many good quotes.
01:36:49.20 --> 01:36:58.84 And look, I'm not saying that you should blindly follow the thoughts and ideas in this
01:36:58.84 --> 01:36:59.84 book.
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:01.72 And I would never say it.
01:37:01.72 --> 01:37:06.52 And we've gone back and forth and we've come to that areas where we disagree with what
01:37:06.52 --> 01:37:08.000 the general has to say.
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.80 But I'll tell you what, add a minimum.
01:37:09.80 --> 01:37:13.12 You should consider them.
01:37:13.12 --> 01:37:14.84 You should consider.
01:37:14.84 --> 01:37:19.28 They could consider those thoughts.
01:37:19.28 --> 01:37:21.16 You should understand where they came from.
01:37:21.16 --> 01:37:23.48 You should understand what they meant.
01:37:23.48 --> 01:37:24.48 You should.
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:31.40 I should keep them in front of mind because these are lessons that were written and blood.
01:37:31.40 --> 01:37:36.48 And they were proved on the battlefield.
01:37:36.48 --> 01:37:40.40 And they were meant as the book states, and you know what I'm saying here saying, hey,
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:43.84 don't you don't follow blindly, guess what the book is called?
01:37:43.84 --> 01:37:46.40 The book is called guidelines.
01:37:46.40 --> 01:37:49.28 It's called guidelines.
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:51.84 Guidelines are supposed to steer us.
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:55.32 They're supposed to get us going in the right direction.
01:37:55.32 --> 01:37:58.80 They're not supposed to be followed blindly.
01:37:58.80 --> 01:38:04.04 They're not supposed to be obeyed with no deviation whatsoever.
01:38:04.04 --> 01:38:06.84 They're supposed to steer us.
01:38:06.84 --> 01:38:16.80 They're supposed to steer the people that we lead in the right direction.
01:38:16.80 --> 01:38:20.44 What do you think, Dave?
01:38:20.44 --> 01:38:21.44 It's kind of crazy, right?
01:38:21.44 --> 01:38:22.44 It's crazy.
01:38:22.44 --> 01:38:24.84 That I'm scribbling.
01:38:24.84 --> 01:38:26.36 I'm writing notes on this.
01:38:26.36 --> 01:38:35.60 I'm thinking about, I'm just thinking about, almost trying to put myself in general
01:38:35.60 --> 01:38:39.40 clerks shoes, as if I could do that.
01:38:39.40 --> 01:38:46.08 That's page after page, after page of what appears to be all this kind of a new shovel.
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:49.56 These little details he's bringing out.
01:38:49.56 --> 01:38:50.72 But they're all things.
01:38:50.72 --> 01:38:56.32 Just like you just said, these are all things that he is probably seen over and over again.
01:38:56.32 --> 01:39:01.08 See the reason why teams don't succeed.
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:05.56 I was trying to summarize what he was saying in my mind is, how much of your plan, how
01:39:05.56 --> 01:39:08.48 much of this thing that you've created, you build the strategy.
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:10.28 This is what we're going to do.
01:39:10.28 --> 01:39:11.76 Then you build a plan.
01:39:11.76 --> 01:39:15.96 How much of that plan, as you go through these other phases, to test it and pressure,
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:22.16 test it and consider the errors in it, how much of that is really based in reality?
01:39:22.16 --> 01:39:24.56 How much of is based in truth?
01:39:24.56 --> 01:39:26.12 How much is this what you're contributing?
01:39:26.12 --> 01:39:28.60 Your own brain thinking, this is all going to work out.
01:39:28.60 --> 01:39:30.08 My idea is brilliant.
01:39:30.08 --> 01:39:31.12 I know what's going to happen.
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:32.88 I put it all together in my head.
01:39:32.88 --> 01:39:37.52 This is how I was going to play out this perfect scenario that I create.
01:39:37.52 --> 01:39:40.68 He's basically saying, don't do that.
01:39:40.68 --> 01:39:47.36 Bring in all these other people to annihilate and poke holes and dig and pick and pull
01:39:47.36 --> 01:39:49.56 every possible error and omission.
01:39:49.56 --> 01:39:57.28 All of the things you haven't done in your plan and in the same breath he's saying,
01:39:57.28 --> 01:40:00.12 and oh, by the way, we're going to stick to the plan.
01:40:00.12 --> 01:40:03.88 The reason we're going to stick to the plan is because actually it's not my plan anymore.
01:40:03.88 --> 01:40:07.24 It hasn't been my plan for a long time because always people came in and understand what
01:40:07.24 --> 01:40:12.88 we're trying to do, pick to the part and they're the ones are going to go execute.
01:40:12.88 --> 01:40:15.56 You talked about humility before.
01:40:15.56 --> 01:40:21.80 The humility of a leader to say, I built the strategy, but the plan, you know why you
01:40:21.80 --> 01:40:25.60 guys are all here to figure out everything wrong with it.
01:40:25.60 --> 01:40:28.80 So you can go execute when the scenario completely falls apart because there's no way I can
01:40:28.80 --> 01:40:31.56 predict what's going to happen.
01:40:31.56 --> 01:40:34.92 I mean, that is crazy.
01:40:34.92 --> 01:40:40.56 The application to that in life is, especially since this is a guideline.
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:43.80 It is universal because that's what you need to do.
01:40:43.80 --> 01:40:46.68 I don't know the tactic, I don't know how the things are going to play out.
01:40:46.68 --> 01:40:48.84 I don't.
01:40:48.84 --> 01:40:54.28 But hearing what he's saying and the risk of creating it in your own mind and saying, this
01:40:54.28 --> 01:40:58.48 is what's going to go happen, go execute and setting your team up to fail for not being
01:40:58.48 --> 01:41:02.000 prepared for the thousands of contingencies that are absolutely going to happen with your
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.88 plan.
01:41:03.88 --> 01:41:07.88 That finish was, and I know it's not the finish of the whole thing, but that finish was crazy.
01:41:07.88 --> 01:41:09.24 And then he likes to, he concludes with it.
01:41:09.24 --> 01:41:12.32 Oh, by the way, if you do all these things, you're after good start.
01:41:12.32 --> 01:41:13.32 You're off to a good start.
01:41:13.32 --> 01:41:14.32 Oh, that's that's man.
01:41:14.32 --> 01:41:19.04 I think I talked about it in the EF online.
01:41:19.04 --> 01:41:25.80 I think I might have even talked about the debrief podcast of planning with a negative attitude.
01:41:25.80 --> 01:41:29.92 Like, when you're coming up with a plan, you should be looking at that thing as a total
01:41:29.92 --> 01:41:31.32 pessimist.
01:41:31.32 --> 01:41:32.32 This isn't going to work.
01:41:32.32 --> 01:41:33.32 We're not going to have enough people.
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:34.92 The enemy is going to be there.
01:41:34.92 --> 01:41:36.88 That's how you want to plan.
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:40.12 And then the other thing you got to be careful of, you know, you just said thousands
01:41:40.12 --> 01:41:41.32 of contingencies.
01:41:41.32 --> 01:41:45.96 And there are thousands of contingencies.
01:41:45.96 --> 01:41:50.36 And there's no possible way you can plan for thousands of contingencies.
01:41:50.36 --> 01:41:55.40 What you can do is you can have decentralized command.
01:41:55.40 --> 01:41:57.32 You can have a plan that's adaptable.
01:41:57.32 --> 01:42:02.36 You can give people the freedom to maneuver, to adapt to those contingencies, which are
01:42:02.36 --> 01:42:05.20 unforeseen.
01:42:05.20 --> 01:42:08.20 As long as they understand why they're doing what they're doing and they understand what
01:42:08.20 --> 01:42:13.24 the intent of the operation is, they can make a thousand decisions that never even talk
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:14.24 to you.
01:42:14.24 --> 01:42:17.04 Never talk to you one time.
01:42:17.04 --> 01:42:18.64 That's the goal.
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:20.88 The plan has to be flexible enough.
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:26.28 The command needs to be decentralized down to the lowest possible level.
01:42:26.28 --> 01:42:29.68 And as long as everybody understands what it is that we're trying to accomplish, they
01:42:29.68 --> 01:42:31.80 understand why they're doing what they're doing.
01:42:31.80 --> 01:42:34.84 They understand the intent of the operation.
01:42:34.84 --> 01:42:44.40 They can make a thousand decisions by themselves and get the mission done.
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:47.96 That is a powerful thing to think about.
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:52.64 So like I said, I think we got one more podcast with this book and it will be done and
01:42:52.64 --> 01:42:54.76 we'll get it out there to the world.
01:42:54.76 --> 01:42:59.08 We'll get some some version of it out there to the troops.
01:42:59.08 --> 01:43:02.84 And that way we can use this book to guide us.
01:43:02.84 --> 01:43:07.68 We'll steer us in the right direction.
01:43:07.68 --> 01:43:17.84 So echo Charles, speaking of steering us and guiding us in the right direction.
01:43:17.84 --> 01:43:19.48 Maybe we're not right direction.
01:43:19.48 --> 01:43:20.48 Maybe we're not right direction.
01:43:20.48 --> 01:43:22.92 We're not going to, when we need that remote.
01:43:22.92 --> 01:43:25.76 We're going to get up and we're going to do the right thing.
01:43:25.76 --> 01:43:27.36 We're going to get the sweat full.
01:43:27.36 --> 01:43:28.36 Yes.
01:43:28.36 --> 01:43:29.84 Solution or the solution with some sweat.
01:43:29.84 --> 01:43:30.84 We'll say.
01:43:30.84 --> 01:43:31.84 Yeah.
01:43:31.84 --> 01:43:32.84 Either way.
01:43:32.84 --> 01:43:33.84 Yes.
01:43:33.84 --> 01:43:34.84 So a path.
01:43:34.84 --> 01:43:35.84 Really?
01:43:35.84 --> 01:43:36.84 Direction.
01:43:36.84 --> 01:43:37.84 The path.
01:43:37.84 --> 01:43:38.84 Yes.
01:43:38.84 --> 01:43:39.84 She's actually.
01:43:39.84 --> 01:43:41.84 I'm not all that right now.
01:43:41.84 --> 01:43:43.84 But I'm going to set up.
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:44.84 Okay.
01:43:44.84 --> 01:43:45.84 Yes.
01:43:45.84 --> 01:43:47.84 We're all on this path.
01:43:47.84 --> 01:43:54.84 And wise men once said path is not easy.
01:43:54.84 --> 01:43:57.84 The path is hard.
01:43:57.84 --> 01:43:58.84 Anyway.
01:43:58.84 --> 01:44:02.84 Okay. So on this path, we do need supplementation.
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:03.84 Okay.
01:44:03.84 --> 01:44:04.84 And supplementation.
01:44:04.84 --> 01:44:10.36 And kind of you kind of forget about this where you know how like you probably will never
01:44:10.36 --> 01:44:11.36 have this problem.
01:44:11.36 --> 01:44:12.36 Maybe you do maybe not at all.
01:44:12.36 --> 01:44:13.36 But they broke maybe.
01:44:13.36 --> 01:44:15.16 So you know how like you're really used to taking.
01:44:15.16 --> 01:44:16.16 Okay.
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:19.44 So I'm really used to taking discipline right before work comes.
01:44:19.44 --> 01:44:23.36 And if I start running low or run out panic.
01:44:23.36 --> 01:44:24.36 Yeah.
01:44:24.36 --> 01:44:28.08 Like, well, for lack of a better term, we'll say, yeah.
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:32.08 But it's the kind like, right, if I run out, I don't know if I can work out.
01:44:32.08 --> 01:44:36.60 Of course, I'm not thinking that specifically, but that's the feeling I get, you know.
01:44:36.60 --> 01:44:39.24 But then I got to remind myself, no, no, this is all supplementation.
01:44:39.24 --> 01:44:40.60 It's help on this path.
01:44:40.60 --> 01:44:41.76 That's what all this stuff is.
01:44:41.76 --> 01:44:43.08 So just keep that in mind.
01:44:43.08 --> 01:44:44.08 Okay.
01:44:44.08 --> 01:44:45.08 All right.
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:52.40 So anyway, with that and the reason I thought about that also another reason was this path is hard.
01:44:52.40 --> 01:44:53.40 Right.
01:44:53.40 --> 01:44:54.40 And like I just said, okay.
01:44:54.40 --> 01:44:56.84 So the other day, my wife got injured.
01:44:56.84 --> 01:44:57.84 Right.
01:44:57.84 --> 01:44:58.84 So I'm not sure if I can do it.
01:44:58.84 --> 01:44:59.84 I'm not sure if I can do it.
01:44:59.84 --> 01:45:04.84 I'm not sure, but I'm saying, I just, I don't want people worried about you.
01:45:04.84 --> 01:45:05.84 Oh, yeah, yeah.
01:45:05.84 --> 01:45:06.84 Correct.
01:45:06.84 --> 01:45:07.84 Yeah.
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:07.84 Yeah.
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:12.16 Some fractures on the feet, you know, whatever, you know, I had to slide in injuries that are not
01:45:12.16 --> 01:45:13.96 life changing in any negative way.
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:15.96 For a very comfortable area.
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:17.96 In convenience.
01:45:17.96 --> 01:45:20.16 But we're pushing through it.
01:45:20.16 --> 01:45:21.16 We're going to recover.
01:45:21.16 --> 01:45:23.84 We're going to shift some, some resources, right?
01:45:23.84 --> 01:45:25.84 Some sliding into various roles.
01:45:25.84 --> 01:45:26.84 Right.
01:45:26.84 --> 01:45:31.16 One of them is required a little bit earlier of a morning for me a lot earlier.
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:32.16 Right.
01:45:32.16 --> 01:45:33.16 Right.
01:45:33.16 --> 01:45:34.16 Right.
01:45:34.16 --> 01:45:37.16 We were not going to go into those details, you know.
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:42.84 But I wound out with, if I'm not mistaken, two hours of sleep, a little bit more than two
01:45:42.84 --> 01:45:43.84 hours.
01:45:43.84 --> 01:45:44.84 Like under three hours of sleep.
01:45:44.84 --> 01:45:45.84 Right.
01:45:45.84 --> 01:45:48.76 So of course, you know what that means.
01:45:48.76 --> 01:45:50.40 The workout becomes questionable.
01:45:50.40 --> 01:45:52.40 You see, I'm saying.
01:45:52.40 --> 01:45:54.88 But so I started thinking.
01:45:54.88 --> 01:45:59.60 And it has to do with what we're talking about last time where you kind of think about
01:45:59.60 --> 01:46:03.76 it like, what does it take to get this workout done?
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:08.56 And my default is, well, obviously a long nap first.
01:46:08.56 --> 01:46:10.72 But let's say that's not available to us.
01:46:10.72 --> 01:46:16.32 When you rather just get it done, well, you know, I'd rather it be done for sure.
01:46:16.32 --> 01:46:21.52 But I don't know about the getting it part, you seem to say, when you're only on two,
01:46:21.52 --> 01:46:22.60 half hours sleep, whatever.
01:46:22.60 --> 01:46:24.68 Anyway, so I'm like, what would it take?
01:46:24.68 --> 01:46:25.68 Okay.
01:46:25.68 --> 01:46:28.48 So what if, and this is just going on, it might might.
01:46:28.48 --> 01:46:33.60 What would it be like, like, what's holding me back from actually just doing it?
01:46:33.60 --> 01:46:38.000 You know, like, what would, is there anything that would keep me from achieving that,
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.44 you know, getting the workout done, some small, like such a small deal when I'm
01:46:42.44 --> 01:46:43.72 playing it out loud.
01:46:43.72 --> 01:46:44.72 But nonetheless.
01:46:44.72 --> 01:46:49.40 Yeah, I saw a video the other day of Joe Rogan and they had Joe Rogan, somebody
01:46:49.40 --> 01:46:53.28 was talking to him and they just were like, they were showing his face while the person
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:57.32 was talking, he was thinking about like some other totally random, he wasn't paying attention.
01:46:57.32 --> 01:46:58.92 Is that how you're feeling right off the side?
01:46:58.92 --> 01:46:59.92 So just in that boat.
01:46:59.92 --> 01:47:03.92 I was just like, dude, what are you talking about?
01:47:03.92 --> 01:47:04.92 You're not trust me.
01:47:04.92 --> 01:47:05.92 Trust me.
01:47:05.92 --> 01:47:06.92 That's bringing home.
01:47:06.92 --> 01:47:07.92 It's going to have some of that.
01:47:07.92 --> 01:47:08.92 Bring it home.
01:47:08.92 --> 01:47:10.68 No, I'm telling you this, I have something to tell you.
01:47:10.68 --> 01:47:11.68 Okay.
01:47:11.68 --> 01:47:16.52 So I wind up just concluding that.
01:47:16.52 --> 01:47:19.36 I ended up concluding that, okay.
01:47:19.36 --> 01:47:23.16 Dave's got to look at the scary thing is Dave's face.
01:47:23.16 --> 01:47:24.52 He's going to rock in his face.
01:47:24.52 --> 01:47:27.92 He's really trying to stay with you.
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:31.52 Yeah, he's staying with me because he knows that he's going to be able to use this.
01:47:31.52 --> 01:47:32.52 Okay.
01:47:32.52 --> 01:47:33.52 Let me get over here.
01:47:33.52 --> 01:47:34.52 All right.
01:47:34.52 --> 01:47:39.76 So anyway, I'm like, okay, technically there's nothing keeping me from getting
01:47:39.76 --> 01:47:43.40 this work up done, even though it seems like a real painful idea right now.
01:47:43.40 --> 01:47:46.60 Is there anything keeping you forgetting this story done?
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:48.40 The actual content of the story.
01:47:48.40 --> 01:47:51.60 So Barry, you should incorporate this mindset into right now.
01:47:51.60 --> 01:47:52.60 Okay.
01:47:52.60 --> 01:47:54.60 I can finish it if I don't start it.
01:47:54.60 --> 01:47:55.60 Okay.
01:47:55.60 --> 01:48:02.08 Anyway, the answer ended up to be nothing aside from me very much not being in the mood
01:48:02.08 --> 01:48:06.96 to I had convinced myself that I need a certain amount of sleep to get a workout done
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:07.96 on an individual level.
01:48:07.96 --> 01:48:08.96 It's not true.
01:48:08.96 --> 01:48:09.96 Not true.
01:48:09.96 --> 01:48:13.72 So it's kind of like, okay, it's kind of a form of realizing that you kind of have
01:48:13.72 --> 01:48:15.16 mental toughness in a way.
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:16.16 Okay.
01:48:16.16 --> 01:48:21.48 Like realizing it, not invoking it, just realizing it and then you can use it.
01:48:21.48 --> 01:48:23.28 So I got the workout done.
01:48:23.28 --> 01:48:24.28 Okay.
01:48:24.28 --> 01:48:25.28 All right.
01:48:25.28 --> 01:48:32.92 What also what that did, what that did also is set the precedent.
01:48:32.92 --> 01:48:33.92 There I was.
01:48:33.92 --> 01:48:36.60 They did it was going nowhere.
01:48:36.60 --> 01:48:38.88 It set the precedent for it.
01:48:38.88 --> 01:48:41.44 If that happens again, you just automatically know.
01:48:41.44 --> 01:48:42.92 You seem saying, okay.
01:48:42.92 --> 01:48:43.92 Rather than trying to deep deep.
01:48:43.92 --> 01:48:44.92 You don't have to dig deep.
01:48:44.92 --> 01:48:47.04 You just gotta realize some stuff sometimes.
01:48:47.04 --> 01:48:48.04 This is what I'm saying.
01:48:48.04 --> 01:48:49.04 Roger.
01:48:49.04 --> 01:48:50.04 Anyway.
01:48:50.04 --> 01:48:53.44 So you can do the supplementation when you're doing these things, whether you're
01:48:53.44 --> 01:48:57.84 out of discipline or not, this is all supplementation.
01:48:57.84 --> 01:49:00.36 You do the workout, you take the supplementation.
01:49:00.36 --> 01:49:02.80 It's like you ever play that game super off-road.
01:49:02.80 --> 01:49:03.80 You play that game?
01:49:03.80 --> 01:49:04.80 No.
01:49:04.80 --> 01:49:05.80 No.
01:49:05.80 --> 01:49:09.40 It's like a game like you race, a truck.
01:49:09.40 --> 01:49:10.84 For real, it makes sense.
01:49:10.84 --> 01:49:16.08 You race in a truck and then if you win, you get credits where you can buy like acceleration
01:49:16.08 --> 01:49:20.72 or speed or traction or whatever.
01:49:20.72 --> 01:49:23.08 That's what every one of these supplements is.
01:49:23.08 --> 01:49:24.08 Okay.
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:27.40 You seem saying, got the discipline for your mind, for your body, got
01:49:27.40 --> 01:49:30.08 won't for the protein, you know, all these things.
01:49:30.08 --> 01:49:35.08 So if you get them all, like you have the full decked out routine for the path,
01:49:35.08 --> 01:49:36.08 this is what I'm saying.
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:37.08 So a bunch of things.
01:49:37.08 --> 01:49:38.08 Join warfare.
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:39.08 Super cruel.
01:49:39.08 --> 01:49:40.08 Discipline.
01:49:40.08 --> 01:49:42.08 Vitamin B.
01:49:42.08 --> 01:49:43.08 Cold War.
01:49:43.08 --> 01:49:44.08 Malk.
01:49:44.08 --> 01:49:49.08 Yeah, but smashing Pumpkin Malk, which has to be just brought up because...
01:49:49.08 --> 01:49:51.08 Yeah, it's good.
01:49:51.08 --> 01:49:55.08 But you gotta include what Malk is, Malk is, though.
01:49:55.08 --> 01:49:56.08 Protein.
01:49:56.08 --> 01:49:58.08 Don't they really know that now?
01:49:58.08 --> 01:49:59.08 Kind of.
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:00.08 I mean, this is the first lesson.
01:50:00.08 --> 01:50:02.08 You're so realistic.
01:50:02.08 --> 01:50:04.08 They know every time.
01:50:04.08 --> 01:50:06.08 I think you're actually incorrect on that.
01:50:06.08 --> 01:50:09.08 I think that, that your opinion is factually incorrect on that.
01:50:09.08 --> 01:50:11.08 I feel like there was a value there.
01:50:11.08 --> 01:50:12.08 Okay.
01:50:12.08 --> 01:50:17.08 Would there something value there or no?
01:50:17.08 --> 01:50:20.08 Do you think there was some value?
01:50:20.08 --> 01:50:21.08 Yes, I'm...
01:50:21.08 --> 01:50:23.08 I gotta be honest with you.
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:27.08 I'm kind of over here thinking there's a little bit of a conflict in what you're saying.
01:50:27.08 --> 01:50:28.08 Okay.
01:50:28.08 --> 01:50:32.08 Because what I would think is, if I was on two hours of sleep, man, and like, look, the soon
01:50:32.08 --> 01:50:33.08 I'd get this...
01:50:33.08 --> 01:50:38.08 Soon I get in, the soon I get out, and you're in complete control of that situation.
01:50:38.08 --> 01:50:41.08 And it's kind of the situation we're in right now, I was like, bro, if there's anybody
01:50:41.08 --> 01:50:45.08 at all of getting through the support phase, it's you.
01:50:45.08 --> 01:50:48.08 Bro, you can jam through this.
01:50:48.08 --> 01:50:50.08 Well, much like you did that workout.
01:50:50.08 --> 01:50:56.08 Well, respectfully, I don't think this phase is the part you just jam through as it were.
01:50:56.08 --> 01:50:58.08 You know, this is important information.
01:50:58.08 --> 01:50:59.08 I don't know.
01:50:59.08 --> 01:51:00.08 I think it is.
01:51:00.08 --> 01:51:01.08 Do you think it is?
01:51:01.08 --> 01:51:02.08 Fair enough.
01:51:02.08 --> 01:51:03.08 All right. Well, it's not jam through it.
01:51:03.08 --> 01:51:04.08 I don't know.
01:51:04.08 --> 01:51:05.08 I don't know.
01:51:05.08 --> 01:51:05.08 Cool.
01:51:05.08 --> 01:51:06.08 Can we get through it?
01:51:06.08 --> 01:51:07.08 Thanks, everyone.
01:51:07.08 --> 01:51:08.08 That's about to press stop.
01:51:08.08 --> 01:51:11.08 Thank you for listening.
01:51:11.08 --> 01:51:12.08 Okay.
01:51:12.08 --> 01:51:13.08 All right.
01:51:13.08 --> 01:51:14.08 Thanks for the support.
01:51:14.08 --> 01:51:15.08 Okay.
01:51:15.08 --> 01:51:18.08 Look, Jock, if you want to be invited back onto the podcast, you can
01:51:18.08 --> 01:51:19.08 bear with me.
01:51:19.08 --> 01:51:23.08 Anyway, supplement joint stuff, joint warfare, super-cryl oil.
01:51:23.08 --> 01:51:25.08 This is for you joints.
01:51:25.08 --> 01:51:30.08 Vitamin D3, Cold War Immunity, also other benefits.
01:51:30.08 --> 01:51:35.08 Discipline, discipline, go for your mind, and your body everyday, take down one.
01:51:35.08 --> 01:51:38.08 It'll help you. Trust me. It'll help you.
01:51:38.08 --> 01:51:44.08 Energy drink, discipline, go RTD, energy drink, healthy, legitimately, factually healthy.
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:52.08 Real energy, real energy, not like am I up for two hours and now we're looking for real energy.
01:51:52.08 --> 01:51:53.08 Clean energy.
01:51:53.08 --> 01:52:01.08 And this sounds kind of odd, but there's no poisonous elements in there.
01:52:01.08 --> 01:52:02.08 Yeah.
01:52:02.08 --> 01:52:07.08 So you need to have to say that until you look at some other energy.
01:52:07.08 --> 01:52:10.08 Things out there that do have places out there.
01:52:10.08 --> 01:52:12.08 That may or may not have places out there.
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:15.08 Or things that can be considered poisonous.
01:52:15.08 --> 01:52:16.08 Yeah.
01:52:16.08 --> 01:52:19.08 So, you know, there is that. So it's a big deal.
01:52:19.08 --> 01:52:22.08 Boom, continuing on the list, MOC, dessert in the form of a protein.
01:52:22.08 --> 01:52:30.08 All kinds of flavors, including, but not limited to smashing pumpkin, which is inspired by pumpkin spice.
01:52:30.08 --> 01:52:34.08 Yeah. It is fall at the moment. Hey, listen, we just real quick.
01:52:34.08 --> 01:52:41.08 When you talked about maybe some other, let's call them energy drinks broadly.
01:52:41.08 --> 01:52:45.08 Right now we're experiencing some conflict.
01:52:45.08 --> 01:52:54.08 Some people might even say acts of war have been, have transpired in this category.
01:52:54.08 --> 01:52:58.08 So we may need to go, well, we will retow it.
01:52:58.08 --> 01:53:06.08 We are retaliating the best way. If you want to help retaliate, and you happen to at this time, when is it?
01:53:06.08 --> 01:53:14.08 If you're alive right now, if you're, it is November 2020.
01:53:14.08 --> 01:53:19.08 We are rolling, we are in wall wash stores in Florida.
01:53:19.08 --> 01:53:25.08 If you're there, and you want to help win the war that we are engaged in at this time, go to wall
01:53:25.08 --> 01:53:37.08 wall, in Florida, and you get yourself a bunch of jacquadissipling go to help us defeat the enemy.
01:53:37.08 --> 01:53:45.08 Thank you. You can also get a vitamin shop. If you're not in Florida, you can also get it at originmain.com.
01:53:45.08 --> 01:53:49.08 You can also get it. You can get it on Amazon. Straight up.
01:53:49.08 --> 01:53:58.08 Also, forgot to mention, Jacco White Tea, Tea Begs, and Cance, by the way. Again, this is supplementation.
01:53:58.08 --> 01:54:02.08 Right? You're on the path with or without this. Now you got the supplementation.
01:54:02.08 --> 01:54:09.08 You got the full decked out vehicle on the path. Good to go. You do all these things.
01:54:09.08 --> 01:54:16.08 You're off to a good start. Hey, hey, speaking of flavors, by the way, you mentioned smashing pumpkin.
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:23.08 Yeah. We have another flavor that's been released into the wild. Yeah. Okay. Dave Burke. What's the new flavor?
01:54:23.08 --> 01:54:26.08 Why don't you tell us the discipline go? Yes.
01:54:26.08 --> 01:54:36.08 flavor. Afterburner Orange. And this is Dave Burke's signature flavor indeed it is.
01:54:36.08 --> 01:54:42.08 So, we this came from when you were a child. You liked to drink orange soda of some kind.
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:47.08 We're not talking about brands. You have replicated that flavor.
01:54:47.08 --> 01:54:54.08 Now is it a little bit because discipline go traditionally is not Serapy sweet. Right?
01:54:54.08 --> 01:55:01.08 It's not sugar. It doesn't have that taste. So, did you is a lighter form of one of these former
01:55:01.08 --> 01:55:06.08 or an orange drinks that you use by design? It's actually supposed to kind of make you remember what it tastes like.
01:55:06.08 --> 01:55:10.08 Well, that is tasting like you're drinking a pile of sugar.
01:55:10.08 --> 01:55:15.08 Cool. And that's exactly what it does. It's a little more refreshing. It is refreshing. It is cleaner.
01:55:15.08 --> 01:55:24.08 But due to it is it is good. So, there you go. If you want to support well, if you want to support afterburner Orange,
01:55:24.08 --> 01:55:28.08 if you want to support Dave Burke. Good deal to yes, that's the one.
01:55:28.08 --> 01:55:32.08 Is it say good deal Dave on the can? It does. This is a good deal.
01:55:32.08 --> 01:55:39.08 Man, you're off to good start. It's cool that anyone can go back in time and witness the creation of the nickname good deal Dave.
01:55:39.08 --> 01:55:44.08 It's pretty, that's kind of cool. Very, very cool. I think it's kind of cool.
01:55:44.08 --> 01:55:46.08 All right. Sorry up. What else?
01:55:46.08 --> 01:55:49.08 Oh, I didn't jam through that man. It was really good. Thank you.
01:55:49.08 --> 01:55:52.08 Yeah. It kind of is my jam. It was one might say.

01:56:24.08 --> 01:56:28.08 We had a little, we had a delta to make. There was a gap.
01:56:28.08 --> 01:56:33.08 We had a little stand down during COVID and we're back up and running.
01:56:33.08 --> 01:56:41.08 And there's a little bit of a redesign. And the new version of Delta 68s are just freaking awesome.

01:57:17.08 --> 01:57:23.08 You know, it's like, oh, check out our new XYZ. I'm not the kind. Well, usually wallets don't like,
01:57:23.08 --> 01:57:28.08 what do you see? They don't, they don't, they don't land. They don't like your fire. They don't like my fire.
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:33.08 Got it. Exactly right. But the origin wallet is basically kind of lit my fire.
01:57:33.08 --> 01:57:38.08 It's actually not less it's on there. Orgeneme.com. Also,

01:59:34.08 --> 01:59:36.08 This podcast.
01:59:36.08 --> 01:59:39.08 Some people like to watch video rather than just audio.
01:59:39.08 --> 01:59:44.08 Maybe more immersive. You know, we got our smart TVs, projectors, whatever the case may be.
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:48.08 Anyway, we do have a YouTube channel also some excerpts on there.
01:59:48.08 --> 01:59:52.08 If you need these messages in smaller, what do you say, doses?
01:59:52.08 --> 01:59:53.08 Mm.
01:59:53.08 --> 01:59:55.08 Not doses. That's not the correct word.
01:59:55.08 --> 01:59:56.08 It seems to work.
01:59:56.08 --> 02:00:00.08 Smaller.
02:00:00.08 --> 02:00:01.08 Cut up clips. Anyway, some excerpts on there.
02:00:01.08 --> 02:00:03.08 Anyway, this is work better than cut up.
02:00:03.08 --> 02:00:06.08 There you go. Boom. There you go. Those is according to Jockel.
02:00:06.08 --> 02:00:08.08 Anyway, yeah, it's on there. Real easy to find YouTube.

02:00:12.08 --> 02:00:17.08 Also psychological warfare. If you have any moments of weakness, two hours of sleep or otherwise.
02:00:17.08 --> 02:00:20.08 If you just in the mood to skip a workout.
02:00:20.08 --> 02:00:22.08 I got three hours of sleep last night.
02:00:22.08 --> 02:00:25.08 Yeah, but you don't count with this sleep thing.
02:00:25.08 --> 02:00:27.08 I said, I said, what I said.
02:00:27.08 --> 02:00:29.08 You're like, yeah, the end point.
02:00:29.08 --> 02:00:30.08 Here's the end.
02:00:30.08 --> 02:00:32.08 What's in Somni. Here's the end Somni.
02:00:32.08 --> 02:00:35.08 Here's what in Somni is like for me.
02:00:35.08 --> 02:00:37.08 My mind isn't a roller coaster.
02:00:37.08 --> 02:00:40.08 Well, I was a roller coaster, but I'm going down tracks.
02:00:40.08 --> 02:00:44.08 And every, like every thought I have, it's just a right turn left turn.
02:00:44.08 --> 02:00:48.08 And I'm just, I, it's just, my mind is just racing.
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:48.08 Yeah.
02:00:48.08 --> 02:00:50.08 And I'm going this, thinking that, thinking another thing.
02:00:50.08 --> 02:00:52.08 And there's no possible way I can go to sleep.
02:00:52.08 --> 02:00:54.08 There's no possible way I can go to sleep.
02:00:54.08 --> 02:00:57.08 And so I was up into, around.
02:00:57.08 --> 02:01:00.08 It was like, it was like 1808.
02:01:00.08 --> 02:01:02.08 The last time I looked at the clock.
02:01:02.08 --> 02:01:03.08 Mm.
02:01:03.08 --> 02:01:06.08 And then the alarm clock went off.
02:01:06.08 --> 02:01:08.08 So like you fell asleep.
02:01:08.08 --> 02:01:10.08 Didn't realize you fell asleep in by the time.
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:14.08 Yeah, so we're just somewhere after 1808.
02:01:14.08 --> 02:01:17.08 I fell asleep.
02:01:17.08 --> 02:01:19.08 And then the alarm clock went off.
02:01:19.08 --> 02:01:20.08 You got to have time.
02:01:20.08 --> 02:01:21.08 You got to have time.
02:01:21.08 --> 02:01:25.08 I'm going to get that.
02:01:25.08 --> 02:01:27.08 I'll get that sometimes that that's actually pretty good description.
02:01:27.08 --> 02:01:29.08 I'll get that sometimes.
02:01:29.08 --> 02:01:31.08 But not before I go to sleep, it'll be like,
02:01:31.08 --> 02:01:33.08 I'll wake up at not quote, I'm quote middle of the night.
02:01:33.08 --> 02:01:35.08 And that'll happen.
02:01:35.08 --> 02:01:37.08 And I can't go back sleep.
02:01:37.08 --> 02:01:40.08 And it gets to the point where I'm like, bro, I just got like 25 more minutes.
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:42.08 I almost got up.
02:01:42.08 --> 02:01:44.08 I almost got up at midnight and just went to work out.
02:01:44.08 --> 02:01:45.08 I probably should have.
02:01:45.08 --> 02:01:46.08 In fact, I should have.
02:01:46.08 --> 02:01:48.08 But I can't think it's right there.
02:01:48.08 --> 02:01:49.08 Like maybe over the ground.
02:01:49.08 --> 02:01:50.08 Maybe around this next corner is.
02:01:50.08 --> 02:01:51.08 It'll be a little while.
02:01:51.08 --> 02:01:52.08 Maybe it's just there.
02:01:52.08 --> 02:01:53.08 Some waiting for it waiting for it.
02:01:53.08 --> 02:01:56.08 And the longer you're trying to wait for it, the harder it is to come around.
02:01:56.08 --> 02:01:59.08 So yeah, that's a debate for sure.
02:01:59.08 --> 02:02:01.08 And then I had a bad, no, I had a dream.
02:02:01.08 --> 02:02:03.08 I had a bad dream.
02:02:03.08 --> 02:02:05.08 I had a dream the other night.
02:02:05.08 --> 02:02:09.08 I'm in like somewhere, some foreign country.
02:02:09.08 --> 02:02:13.08 And something happens.
02:02:13.08 --> 02:02:16.08 And we like get the call like, hey, we got to go right now.
02:02:16.08 --> 02:02:18.08 And so I run to get my gear.
02:02:18.08 --> 02:02:21.08 I pick up my gear and my magazines are not loaded.
02:02:21.08 --> 02:02:24.08 And the helicopter's coming into like, take us to do whatever we got to do.
02:02:24.08 --> 02:02:25.08 There's guys in trouble.
02:02:25.08 --> 02:02:29.08 The helicopter comes in and I'm sitting there loading mags as fast as I can.
02:02:29.08 --> 02:02:31.08 And then I'm running.
02:02:31.08 --> 02:02:36.08 And I see the helicopter leaving with like my guys on board and it's leaving.
02:02:36.08 --> 02:02:37.08 And I missed it.
02:02:37.08 --> 02:02:39.08 Like they had to go.
02:02:39.08 --> 02:02:42.08 And, bro, I mean, I was just like feeling sick.
02:02:42.08 --> 02:02:45.08 And I woke up and it took me, you know, whatever.
02:02:45.08 --> 02:02:49.08 Ten seconds to realize that it didn't really happen.
02:02:49.08 --> 02:02:51.08 And so I had the worst feeling ever.
02:02:51.08 --> 02:02:54.08 And then five seconds later, I'm like super thankful.
02:02:54.08 --> 02:02:57.08 And then I'm bummed out again because it happened.
02:02:57.08 --> 02:02:58.08 You were brave.
02:02:58.08 --> 02:02:59.08 No, right, that makes sense.
02:02:59.08 --> 02:03:01.08 I was gonna like kind of tease you whatever.
02:03:01.08 --> 02:03:02.08 You're like, we're talking about.
02:03:02.08 --> 02:03:04.08 But I said I can dream.
02:03:04.08 --> 02:03:05.08 Not with that kind of stuff.
02:03:05.08 --> 02:03:06.08 Obviously, but it was with football games.
02:03:06.08 --> 02:03:09.08 Like I'm like trying to make it to the football game or whatever.
02:03:09.08 --> 02:03:11.08 And then I can like hear on the radio.
02:03:11.08 --> 02:03:12.08 It's like half time.
02:03:12.08 --> 02:03:13.08 You know, that's where you're into the first quarter.
02:03:13.08 --> 02:03:15.08 And I'm like, not even at the game yet.
02:03:15.08 --> 02:03:17.08 And it's like, you know, it's third quarter.
02:03:17.08 --> 02:03:19.08 And I get there in the game is like finishing.
02:03:19.08 --> 02:03:20.08 Two.
02:03:20.08 --> 02:03:25.08 We never would have anticipated in one million years that you had some kind of anxiety about being late for it.
