life was the first guy that I met actually life in Tony all right show up together um so we had seen you guys you know we had turned over and we were just kind of getting up to speed we probably been there maybe a month or so before you guys had so you know quick learning curve we're just kind of getting comfortable with what's going on we also know there's a new brigade of platoon coming in I'm sorry a new um uh uh armor division coming in the we know that the unit that we're there the two to eight that brigade combat team is leaving we knew new brigade combat team is coming in and we were actually in just a relative a short period of time we were kind of the continuity because all the old guys are leaving we had we had the overlap so we had a kind of a prominent role with a new battalion and the new battalion commander he's retired now um awesome dude from uh one three seven armor guy named Tedesco just an awesome dude just an awesome dude awesome um he would have been there as part of his turnover it had come out a couple months prior maybe a month prior and saw us and we had my favorite thing about Tedesco is like he said awesome guy we we were getting ready to do a big operation with them and I said you know what I'm going to bring you a professional professional with that specific information so Dave will be talking obviously life is going to be there J.P. is going to be there clearly as well J.P. is going to be doing a little presentation as well from his perspective on some things echo Charles you know echo Charles is going to be there will he be doing a presentation I don't know time will tell I don't know what he would present on maybe just present on you know we can bring all the intensity make it do a presentation on cruising you know that things up a little bit back it through a little balance it do that dichotomy right there May we started taking I mean not started we continue to take casualties and I'm starting to go to memorials and we're starting to see guys that we knew and worked with and were friends with and built relations with and they're they're they're getting killed or really gravely wounded and those memorials started to become every couple of days we're going to a memorial and that sort of ways on you I thought about this a lot and how it affected me you know it's a pilot being out of my comfort zone in this environment and what that was like but without trying to diminish any of that loss there's a there's a disconnect when it's not your person it's not your guy and on June 20th so Chris Leon who was my radio operator we were in a building that we had been in let me back up I was not there I had left that building that morning gone back to the CUC Adam's team with Chris had replaced us and we're basically just going back and forth operations and this this combat outpost because it gave us a really good view of the north part of the city and we had to be there basically 24 seven and and Chris and and Adam's team had gone back out there and they were supposed to go from like 12 to 4 something like that I don't know what it was we gave him like a six-hour shift or something There was two F-18 D's I remember from an East Coast squadron and you know a TBS they teach you hey everyone Marines arrive on man and they say they tell you these stories is that one day you're going to be in a position where you're going to be in a firefight and there's going to be an airplane overhead and it's going to be a buddy of yours from TBS going to be your old buddy and you're going to be like hey Jaco it's day to help me out and Dave's going to roll in on his white horse and come over this hornet and blast these things out and your infantry buddy is going to thank you one day. So I worked hard to try to be successful in that, and you know, you got to get your Marines to buy off on your program, you know, because you're going to go down town with those guys, you know, and every relationship with anyone with those guys was different as you know, you know, and you got to build those relationships and demonstrate that, you know, this is going to work. it's going to be a New York city by the way Dave will be there he's going to do a little presentation because you know what he's going to do a presentation he's going to probably do about the utalope I can a lot of questions about the utalope he's going to do a presentation about the utalope it's going to be 14 hours now he's going to talk you know he's going to talk about his his perspective all a lot of the stuff and an utalope a lot of times people ask me about the utalope because I do talk about it is I Adam I watched the trucks pull up they all get out you know four guys and everybody else had heard you know all the angle code teams that were there and we shared a facility with EOD and working with everybody you know where did it was passed something had happened and I you know a corphing on corphing on stead you know we do something called a hero flight and a hero flight is going to be like 1600 I got the information like 10 minutes the process of them bringing a casualty that casualty not surviving and then moving they had that thing wired And like you said, so you know, you're, you're a student, you know, you're not going to be as good as the instructors, but what you don't know is that you're not just going to lose, you're going to get, you're not just going to lose or get annihilated, you're not even going to know what happened. and I actually went back last night to look at my journal entry for that day because I ended up running down Charlie Medigan because that's where everybody came in and I remember seeing Lave there you know Lave was a guy I don't work with the ton and there he is he's got a wound I'm looking at him over I'm saying over as I told her they kind of shirt off they're they're they're attending to Lave who was Lave was a larger than life you know for guy like me who always kind of fell to a little bit like what the hell am I doing her man without my doing with the seals like this isn't sane these guys are just they're just larger than life and to see the exposure of that it bothered me I mean not retire from the ring you've got to know the Marine Corps so I can not do all these other things that I'm not set up this future that I told you all about and so do you on totally so to say that my wife and and everybody's got those stories the laundry list of reasons why she should have just sort of cut bait and be like no this is not happening is a lot longer than the list of reasons why she shouldn't have and props were good she's here and my marriage with her you know for all the ups and downs it goes on get everybody's marriage the one thing I don't worry about even even when we're at our worst at our absolute worst which our worst is whatever it is we have our worst moments at our absolute worst I don't have a shred and have a brain cell of thought of I wonder if our marriage is going to survive this you know this throat animal having over god knows what you know anyway I'm as well make the best of it we started to do a couple of missions and everyone of those missions was your teams and my teams uh and I would say probably in the first week or so you know I'm guessing a little bit of dates but relatively quick in the first couple of missions we are doing the similar things we were bringing support and Overwatch and helping these guys through their job which is the exact same thing you guys were doing you know totally different ways but ultimately we were supporting these guys I meant my my little building there or one day whatever just sitting around prepping for something and in walks lay in Tony you know they they drove over from your base which is kind of you know a little bit of a haul around around their job yeah man so then you you do come back I mean obviously like you said it ramped up it ramped up all the time and the guys were just you know everybody like I'm not just talking about our guys I'm talking about everybody it ramped up hardcore it got hotter outside the the the combat got more intense the enemy started fighting harder they got more square away and like you said you and the rest of the guys there did the mission day after day night after night and then one day you fly home but the moment when you get those little spikes and those is what kind of comes up and get you those little spikes was a sort of unforeseen kind of reactions he could see that in me and I could see that in him we had actually been really we're really good for each other when I see him kind of get a little shaky a little break like I'm not you know he's not digging his environment a little bit or he'd see that of me you had that other person I kind of bring you back to helping you helping you deal with that which is good the flip side of that while it was really helpful for him to be there I think it was really tough on Whitney because she was not my outlet for that I wasn't kind of got cut out totally and not I didn't certainly not by design so the back left of his truck entered door and the right front of my truck door we always had a fight space for each other you know Chris was a standard perfect Marine like he could be 90% of the way through if he saw me walking up he'd get out of the way close the door to let me in on my cockman dude like just he was a great Marine just I walked past that kid without even really talking him you know a thousand times just every single day a couple of times a day and it demystifies as a Marine you just live a slightly bit for me I shouldn't say you how it felt for me as I just felt with all that was going on and all the destruction and the death and the violence and all the things that I'd sort of become accustomed to at that point there's just an aspect of it that's just a tiny bit insulated in your life to a really small degree that no problem and during that time it was not uncommon to take fire and from that in that OP and there was some sniper fire and the first shot there was a younger marina lands corporal who was up there and Chris ran up from the other side and kind of put him down you know say hey once you get down take cover go go over the other side of the building and Chris got up to start to he was doing his observation to try to figure out what was going on and Chris was shot by sniper and I get a call kind of very closely after that from Adam you know I'm kind of man in the radio's all the time anyway even our home will base there like we're we had a radio I got, I just got interviewed the other day and it was a, the guy, you know, he sent me a blue question, you know, hey, what do you do when you're in a situation where you've got, you know, you want to go to the gym or you're, you're supposed to do some hard task for workers to some, trying to do something to improve yourself and you, you know, the, the mindset comes in where you just, you just don't want to do it. and you walk back you literally walk away from the medical facility where the helicopter just takes off and you walk back on to your original you just go back to your room only Chris has gone and it's like that whole deployment kind of re I don't know what the right word is it's like I had to start the deployment again because all the things that I was dealing with and all things that I was managing and leading is as it's a leader would know whatever you want to say was my job it all is sort of change in terms of what I thought really well the guys that I was working with everything was different now because it was their brother that was gone not somebody else and I was shocked and kind of overwhelmed at how professional your organ at your team was and that was the biggest thing for me was what are these guys going to be like I just sort of picture day kind of a pickup game hit us go there and just you know kill some bad guys and come on back and high five each other and dude it was one of the most professional organized mission briefs I totally understood what your plan was I knew exactly what I was going to fit in we went and did it and that hurt a lot that hurt in ways that I did not understand how it was gonna hurt I just didn't I just didn't know what that was gonna be like and the the all those next steps and you I know you know this because you you saw it he's on a helicopter and he's gone flying away in that 46 in what feels like about a minute it's ours and our even rehearsed the movement onto the to carry him onto the hell I knew something was a on this because on the drive home from the airport I find a San Diego international just down the road my wife and my my mom who lives in San Diego both of them came to pick me up from the airport you've already met my mom great lady my wife and my mom picked me up from the airport I got pictures of them meeting me there getting the car drive from San Diego international to our house in Pacific Beach and as we're pulling like on to Chelsea any up to the house I like screamed at them told them stop talking or something like that I said something like I don't even I don't know what it was well this is a whole thing I was opening up with that's sort of where that came from it's just this attitude that everybody there was on the same team straight up on the same team and so then that turned into big missions you know big missions pushing into Ramadi putting in the combat outpost you know night after night after night day after day doing those those big operations and that relationship just got just got stronger and stronger you know lay obviously with you and and just turned into something really we not just not just cool How do we determine, you know, when we were talking, kind of trying to talk through that and the idea that an airliner filled with civilians, and we knew, you know, at that point that those other airliners are regular commercial airplanes that just took off, they're going their flight and they crash, we knew everybody on board, you know, nobody's going to survive that. so I I knew Adam and the rest of team were trying to get back and they're going to have a slower road back because they're not going to get the support it's just going to take a little more time going to get their gear and all the things go along with that Chris just got loaded in the humbian and racing back and Bradley they're kind of loaded up their humbians and it's just going to take some time and you know I think that's one of the things that that we felt you know that little bit of insulation that you're talking about we felt that we felt I would say I would say actually more insulated because you know my guys were out there taking massive risks getting in crazy gun fights getting after it to a degree that no one had ever thought they would and we were doing all right we had a couple guys get wounded here and and you gotta deal with them we all deal with it differently I had maybe talk myself into out 33 as fairly experienced guy I was surrounded by very young marines who maybe in my mind didn't have maybe the emotional maturity maybe the life skills to maybe manage some of these same chaotic things you know guys at saw Chris get shot you know I maybe kind of built myself up a little bit as a little better equipped and I was better equipped in my mind where and you're going to have to just deal with it so there was a I think the thing that bothered me the most and was part of just kind of getting back to day to day life was it I would get when things didn't go well when I had my moments my irrational is just I just get pissed off it was that feeling of so you I have this like some event would happen something stupid would catch my attention and kind of height my you know my response and because it happened I'd be annoyed myself that I let it that I let it bother me there but they were okay and honestly that guys getting wounded you know it's not a devastating wound I mean I had you know one of my guys got wounded early on and he almost lost his leg but guess what he didn't and that that didn't make us feel more vulnerable in my mind it made us feel stronger and like hey we might get wounded but what we're gonna be good and I'm not like doing this calculation if I don't want my head she's not I'm not going to use her as a resource you know for that and to be honest with you too there's also a little part of you know what the corner of Michigan sunset is like so totally man you know we had done a big movement in earlier in June and we were really starting to lay into the city but the real you know the crazy jay block you know that kind of stuff all that stuff was all out in front of us and so for me it was you know my entire career so I was worried like I got to find something and that's part of the reason why that first gig with you guys in the back was like holy cow man you you've got to be kidding me it's all those things you just discussed all those things I spent on a whole life living and breathing and learning and and and then it's with people like late in jocco from where my work we're gonna do this yeah we looked at it as if okay we that gives us one more shooter and it gives us a whole new level of expertise now of course there's jaytah and the seal teams that they are a lot more experience and they are awesome and of course but in our group you to bring you guys was just a huge level up for us to get a lot better and give us more people to maneuver as seals on assaults or on Overwatch or whatever so it turned out to be a real good little little relationship that I got going there it was a classic win win when when a seal says hey would you control the air so I can go shoot people you know and what I'm doing back from that deployment in January I think it is of the following year and it it turns out that the Marine Corps wants to send a guy to go fly F-22s for the with the year force for three years and they're accepting applications for the F-22 Raptor Exchange which had never been happened before never happened since there was a one time thing and the guy got it they picked you know it was going to go to non-deploying in NLS and fly the F-22 Raptor should properly apply I guess it seems like a reasonable thing to do because if they say no I'm they're something missing and I can't I can't stay in Marine because there's something missing well you leave the Marine Corps like how in the hell am I gonna recreate that thing that I'm looking for not in the military it's all I know is that's the place and that was my biggest my biggest fear was I'm not gonna go like go to work you know go do something that I you know I mean like hey they check at this ridiculous of own vulnerability that I have right now that I'm going to carry with me for God that was how long that's going to come up I didn't know by the beat I think and an auto body shop is running the the air drill to pull some tires off I can root you know that kind of sound and as we're walking I think my left arm is over her her shoulder we're walking like this I hear that sound and my first reaction is I've pushed her down to the ground and in the time that it takes to do that and catch that it's happening is maybe a third of a second you know what I mean so I hear it but I was certainly interested in what because my fear was that you guys are going to go do your own thing and my guys are kind of just either not be able to keep up not know what you're doing and not fit in very well and be able to help out and just kind of put ourselves at risk and and look I'll I'll say this very bluntly I have a very high bar when you leave Top Gunna what to expect from a mission brief and mission execution a mission debrief because that's what we're all about and I was pretty sure that there's no chance that you're going to do anything anywhere near that and so I continued my education jobs options and started working towards my MBA because I needed something or wanted something else and once you kind of catch in your mind that the Marine Corps and what they're asking you to do I was going to go back to a training squadron I wanted to go to be an operational commander with operational units that are preparing to go something I wasn't going to get to do that I was going to go back to a training environment I caught myself losing the thing that was the most passionate about the Marine Corps and seeing it's more of like okay three years here this will get me to this retirement and this amount of money and it was just starting to become a little too professional and not enough a passion so it just all it was man it was it was those two things like that's not good and this is gonna probably happen again I'm gonna need to I'm gonna need to think about this I can't pretend like I'm not gonna just have some sort of residual you can't leave Ramadi being San Diego six days later and not bring some baggage home with you and I was bringing some baggage home and there's some baggage there And they pick one or two guys every couple years from me, every squadron to go to the school and the whole point of going there is a U-Learn kind of this advanced, you know, it's like a master's degree basically in being a fighter pilot with the intent that you can bring back to the squadron and be one of the kind of key trainers a key leaders in the squadron. so I'm here in a different angle and like I talk about with with everything it was like we just talked about with with flying at top gun or like it isn't your jitter or like it isn't the battlefield the more different angles you can see something from the better you're going to get at it but it was just kind of a kind of a med job I was you know very nine to five strict hours don't take work on we know black Barry no real responsibility pretty chill life life was pretty good I selected I picked up Colonel while I was there the end of 2015 I was selected for Colonel and in the summer of 2016 I selected for a command again as a Colonel this time to command and have 35 squadron and I think just the the fact that I had responses pissed me off and I would just kind of honestly I have a temper about it and that was she got to see me just get pissed off itself for no real good reason which you never really get pissed off like I mean I have tempered some pictures stuff that just I would get mad about stuff that just didn't make sense I mean I have a temper about things that my computer pisses me off just like it pisses you off man that's totally normal and I know there's one junior officer out there who's now probably a lieutenant commander or maybe even a commander at this point but at that time you know he was on his first deployment and he was a jaytah what we call in the seal teams are air controllers are called a jaytah and so here he is and some of those missions instead of being a seal he's being a jaytah so he's one of those guys that looked over it you guys and said hey wait a second can you take this radio for me and do that thing You were explaining some of the rules and how you'd set it up and they have, you know, and you did, you know, you, you, you, you, okay, you know, you start standing, you know, you shake hands, bomb fist, I can now it's on. I took off at San Diego and flying overhead, Los Angeles International Airport, and we had guys that taken off in the carrier that had life missiles, and they were doing a cap, and I'm flying, you know, kind of opposite direction overhead, LAX looking down, and, you know, I grew up in San Diego, where LAX, like one of the busiest airports in the world, planes all over the tarmac on the runways, on the taxiways, because there's, everybody landed, nobody took off. It was like three hours to get on the base, you know, they're inspecting it, reviical, you know, every car getting pulled over, dodgers, you know, the whole nine yards that just the security. You know, as a pilot in combat, and you know, I'd done so to watch, but obviously, you know, nothing like this. man I was like I don't know you gave your first two paragraphs of talking you know your first two minutes of of explaining something I was like and so you kind of think how is any you know it's like when you're in command of something that's one of the really hard things to do is let go you know and you had a valid reason for it they were laughing at me if I said I wanted an AC 130 gunship like who are you I'm Dave Burke man and like negative lathe and jocca need an AC 130 gunship not every time you know obviously there's a thin asset but that thing should have over head and we found a way to make that stuff work now it was it was a big deal for me though man to to for me and my guys to work with you guys because you've said this on the podcast and I know I know how organizations can we're not necessarily perocule that we don't trust other people yeah so Lafen talked to me a couple years ago when I was leaving that F-35 job before I went up to DC and he's like hey man joc on our doing this thing it's going to be awesome um we'd love to you know talk about it I am I'm I want to I want to I want in right now like a slow down like no 100% I don't want I don't want to go look for like this is still happening right now And when this was the environment or the circumstances and you see that stuff and that's when you talk about seeing the future, I mean, if you really want to be a jerk about it, you know, if guys of your buddies, you know, I'll get in the radio like a buddy of mine. so yeah when Mark got killed and especially Mark who was you know such a gargarius and such a guy so full of life that you don't think he can be killed you don't think he can be killed and same thing you know that insulation was just completely shattered and it's cool too because you get that kind of for you top gun for me working in the training command where it's like like what I already talked about you you have this experience and when I was getting out I'm saying what am I gonna do with this thing what am I gonna do that I got all this knowledge I'll tell you what helped the most is my best friend who had been in Ramadi and endured all of that loss the look our story you know the the guys that we replaced the guys that replaced us it's a very similar story a lot they understand that you know I think having an outlet having one other dude it happened to be my best friend super 14 You know, you don't want to be last at top gun because then you're just last and when we last and anything who does and so that's a real kind of a type of a real aggressive group of dudes and they pull you and you you got to keep up and sometimes you know, a couple guys here and they're done for for the most part the selection process works pretty well. and it's the same thing with you I was like you know you're thinking okay where's he gonna go with this with this is a tough question or whatever and boom here you go you know fire for a fact and both those two events happened really close together for me and for for me it was and and life's talked about this all the time you know when I'd be watching him roll out on out the gate for his first mission I done all kinds of missions like that and here he's going out of his first one that he's in charge of and you're thinking man I should just go I want to go and I want to go Probably my team by like 15 feet below us so above their heads and below us that's the first thing that happens and there was a vehicle like a truck and I was a car was like just some car in between on a look kind of a dirt road behind some trees where this fire came from and we had airplanes overhead. And then, you know, just talk a little bit about, you know, people have heard about what you bruiser was doing over in Ramadi, and we'll get to how we interacted, but overall, all you guys doing, when you first got there, you just kind of jumped into it, we could feed as they say. go do that that's awesome and feeling good about that that we weren't helpless and we're just gonna suck it up and deal with this just this terrible loss that we're gonna get something from this we're gonna go find some guys and go get after it and we're gonna go kill these guys and you guys we're gonna you guys are gonna make that happen I'm sorry man you know it was kind of an odd conversation I could tell the why he was looking like why I ask him this question like it just was one of those things I think it's a stage of disbelief that as I walked back and I was going to deliver the news I had sort of told myself like I can't tell them in case what if I'm wrong because I never really went through that I saw him I saw Doc but there were no words or exchange and I had this very odd like walking back and forth a couple of times and kind of sorting it out then it and between Chris and Mark the army suffered oh I'm God bless we are going to memorials like every couple of days people are getting killed all the time and everyone of those you wrote that that confidence a little bit and when it happened to Mark and Dave that was hard to see that and it that was the feeling that I had it was like Just like when you're in the cockpit and you do something and you know what that person you know what they're going to do. so I when I told him like hey man I dropped my letter I'm getting out and like I said Lafen isn't always the easiest guy to get a hold of right away to talk sometimes he's he's got a lot on his place a busy guy and that you're now involved with for a long term and and even then you know because then for us you know I wanted to see what you were going to do and see how you were going to do it and and he's like who you know who these guys uh I'm in the middle of doing a real control happening being the COC that day blew up a car it's all in the video get this big TV screens to show the whole thing this card detonates and cool pictures and everything and he he comes over to me after we're done I'm kind of sitting there and I know like I need to get back to the vehicle we parked our trucks because I want to meet them there and I walk back like I said it was maybe 100 yards from my hooch to Charlie Man and I get about halfway there And then you know three turns later is when you get to take advantage of that because you know some time we'll have to play out for his mistake to really reveal itself like man, I can't believe you just did that. And he's like, look, we're going to, as a top instructor, you've got a lot of skill, we've got a lot of experience, and then want you to use that and bring it back to the Marine Corps and go to a squadron and teach these guys. but I think I just remember sitting in the passenger seat and some the gears just start I'm in a truck or a car I like whenever I don't know what it was but something's going on and I think just the pressure is building
