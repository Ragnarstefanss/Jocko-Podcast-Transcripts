00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 39 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I heard of a high British officer who went over the battlefield just after the action was over.

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
American boys were still lying dead in their foxholes. Their rifle still grasped and firing position in their dead hands.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the veteran English soldier remarked,

5
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:54.000
time and again in a sort of hushed eulogy spoken only to himself. Brave men. Brave men.

6
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that is the name of the book we are going to delve into now. Brave men.

7
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And a few episodes ago we talked with Keirin Dardi, Warford Toggerfer.

8
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And when we talked with him we talked about Warcorrespondence as well.

9
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I wanted to get a warcorrespondent here. And in this case the one that we're going to be talking to is possibly the most famous warcorrespondent ever,

10
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Guy by the name Ernie Pile. And we will join him now on a warship,

11
00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:08.000
steaming towards an inevitable invasion.

12
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The front line soldier I knew lived for months like an animal.

13
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And was a veteran in the cruel fierce world of death.

14
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Everything was abnormal and unstable in his life. He was filthy dirty.

15
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Eight if and when slept on hard ground without cover. His clothes were greasy and he lived in a constant haze of dust

16
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
pestered by flies and heat moving constantly deprived of all things that once meant stability.

17
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Things such as walls, chairs, floors, windows, faucets, shelves, Coca-Cola.

18
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And the little matter of knowing that he would go to bed at night in the same place he had left in the morning.

19
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
The front line soldier has to harden his inside as well as his outside or he would crack under the strain.

20
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Some thoughts from early pile out on a ship getting ready for this invasion talking about what the soldiers were like.

21
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And he'd been in Africa. And now he's out there with sailors and he has something to say about the sailors as well.

22
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Of course, when sailors die, death for them is just as horrible.

23
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And sometimes they die in greater masses than soldiers.

24
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But until the enemy comes over the horizon, a sailor doesn't have to fight.

25
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A front line soldier has to fight everything all the time.

26
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It makes a difference in a man's character.

27
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And an early pile goes on to talk about what he thinks of the front line soldier.

28
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Everyone by now knows how I feel about the infantry.

29
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm a rabid one man movement bent on tracking down and stamping out everybody else in the world who doesn't fully appreciate the common front line soldier.

30
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And if I haven't made myself perfectly clear in everything I say and everything I do, that's the same exact feeling that I have about the infantry.

31
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Respect and admiration.

32
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And now he's talking about what it was like, what's going through their minds as they're going to partake in this art invasion.

33
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And he had to remember he's going on invasion too.

34
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
But when he's when these things are happening, this is a war correspondent.

35
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
This isn't somebody that's reporting from some safe position.

36
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And you're going to see plenty of that here.

37
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
He's going in.

38
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So he can relate to what the troopers are going through mentally.

39
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And this is a very, really accurate description.

40
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And back to the book.

41
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I don't believe one of us was afraid of the physical part of dying.

42
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
That isn't the way it is.

43
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The emotion is rather one of almost desperate reluctance to give up the future.

44
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
They're not afraid of the physical stuff.

45
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It's the reluctance to give up the future.

46
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I suppose that splitting hairs and that it really all comes under the heading of fear.

47
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yet somehow there is a difference.

48
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
These gravely yearn for futures of men going into battle include so many things.

49
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Things such as seeing the old lady again of going to college, of staying in the Navy for a career,

50
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
of holding on your knee just once your own kid whom you've never seen.

51
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Of again becoming champion salesman of your territory,

52
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
or driving a cold truck around streets of Kansas City once more.

53
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And yes, even just sitting in the sun once more on the south side of a house in New Mexico.

54
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
When we huddled around together on the dark decks,

55
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
it was these little hopes and ambitions that made up the sum total of our worry at leaving,

56
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
rather than any visualization of physical agony to come.

57
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Very, very accurate.

58
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Now, and I got to say that with this book, this is a fairly, fairly thick book.

59
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What do we got? Almost 500 pages.

60
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And I had to burn through big chunks of it to get to some of the stuff that I wanted to cover.

61
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But there's a lot of very important detail in here.

62
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And one of the things that Ernie Pile was known for was capturing what it was like,

63
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
not for the big general, not for the big strut strategist,

64
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but what it was like to live every day as it as a crunch.

65
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So the invasion takes place, and I think this was the, they went into Italy.

66
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And Ernie actually spent that invasion on the ship, the initial part of the invasion,

67
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and then he goes ashore. And for whatever reason, he gets sick.

68
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's like sick.

69
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So, it doesn't get wounded, but he just gets ill, and he ends up in a field hospital.

70
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And we've had several, several books take us into field hospitals,

71
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and we know that they are a horrible, horrible place.

72
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
But there is some pretty glorious things that come out of those two,

73
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and I'll go to the book here.

74
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It was flabbergassing to me to lie there and hear wounded soldiers,

75
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
cuss and beg to be sent right back to the fight.

76
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Of course, not all of them did that.

77
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It depended on a severity of their wounds, and on their individual personalities,

78
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
just as it wouldn't peace time.

79
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But at least a third of the less severely wounded men asked if they couldn't return to duty immediately.

80
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So all those fears that we just talked about, and then you go into battle,

81
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and you get wounded, and the first thing you do when you get back to the aid station,

82
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and say, send me back to the front.

83
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
He goes into a specific case here.

84
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
One big blonde infantryman had slight flesh wounds in the face,

85
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and the back of his neck.

86
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He had a patch on his upper lip, which prevented him from moving it,

87
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and made him talk in a grave, straight-faced manner that was comical.

88
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I've never seen anybody so mad in my life.

89
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
He went from one doctor to another, trying to get somebody to sign his card,

90
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
returning him to duty.

91
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The doctors explained patiently that if he returned to the front,

92
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
his wounds become infected,

93
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and he would be a burden to his company, instead of a help.

94
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
They tried to entice him by telling him there would be nurses back in the hospital,

95
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but in his peaceful Oklahoma draw, he retorted to hell with the nurses.

96
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I want to get back to fighting.

97
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Dying men were brought into our tent.

98
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Men whose death rattles silence the conversation and made us all thoughtful.

99
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
When a man was almost gone, the surgeons would put a piece of gauze over his face.

100
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
He could breathe through it, but we couldn't see his face well.

101
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Twice within five minutes, Chaplin's came running.

102
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
One of those occasions haunted me for hours.

103
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The wounded man was still semi-conscious.

104
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
The Chaplin knelt down beside him, and two ward boys squatted nearby.

105
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
The Chaplin said,

106
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
John, I'm going to say a prayer for you.

107
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Somehow this stark announcement hit me like a hammer.

108
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It didn't say I'm going to pray for you to get well.

109
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
He just said he was going to say a prayer.

110
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And it was obvious to me that he meant a final prayer.

111
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He voiced the prayer, and the weak, gasping man tried vainly to repeat the words after him.

112
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
When he had finished the Chaplin added, John, you're doing fine.

113
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
You're doing fine.

114
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Then he rose and dashed off on some other call,

115
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and the ward boys went about their duties.

116
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
The dying man was left utterly alone.

117
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Just lying there on his litter, on the ground, lying in an aisle because the tent was full.

118
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Of course it couldn't be otherwise.

119
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But the aloneness of that man, as he went through the last few minutes of his life, was what tormented me.

120
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I felt like going over, and at least holding his hand while he died,

121
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
but it would have been out of order, and I didn't do it.

122
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I wish now I had.

123
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:43.000
In addition to talking about the infantry, he also talks about the engineers,

124
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and for those of you that don't know, engineers are basically military construction people, that build things.

125
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
They also do other jobs like getting rid of mines and doing mine clearance.

126
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They do that often as well.

127
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And we'll go back to the book.

128
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
During the latter days of the Sicilian campaign, I spent all my time with combat engineers of two different divisions.

129
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The engineers were in it up to their ears.

130
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Scores of times during the Sicilian fighting, I heard everybody from general's to private's remark that this is certainly an engineer's war.

131
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And indeed it was.

132
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Every foot of our advance upon the gradually withdrawing enemy was measured by the speed with which our engineers could open the highways, clear the mines,

133
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and bypass the blown bridges.

134
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And this, this was the same thing that we had in Romadi.

135
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
The engineers were just absolutely.

136
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
First of all, they were incredibly professional, and their job was incredibly dangerous.

137
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
They were playing mines, they were doing these buildings, combat outposts in the little city.

138
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Are they armed, the engineer, in your case?

139
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yeah, they are, but you know, picture a guy that has to go and move sandbags at the top of a building.

140
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
He's carrying a 60 pound sandbag.

141
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
He's got all of his gear on.

142
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And it's a semi-protected area, not fully protected.

143
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
But so a lot of times, they might have a pistol on them, but they're working.

144
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
They're construction work.

145
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
They're working construction.

146
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
You know, now that doesn't mean that they're not also picking up security when they have to.

147
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But man, it's a, it's a grueling, grueling job, and so incredibly dangerous.

148
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And the book also talks about other pieces.

149
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
You know, again, we talk about infantry, but there's other pieces.

150
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
There's engineers who are doing all this building.

151
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
There's artillery, which is, you know, drop in bombs on the enemy.

152
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And actually, that was another surprisingly, there was artillery.

153
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But we utilize the utilize artillery fairly significantly in Ramadi.

154
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Yeah, that, that, that, that, that, when you think about that, like the engineers in a war zone,

155
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
right, it's not like compared to like an MMA fight right, the cut man,

156
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
where he's like facilitating all these things, giving water whatever,

157
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
but that's between rounds.

158
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
He's not part of the fight.

159
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The engineer guys, they're straight up, yeah, they're going to get hit.

160
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But here's the thing, they're not, they're, specifically, two fight.

161
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So they're there to do some other stuff, so it's like man, they can be blindsided.

162
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Like all that stuff.

163
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It's incredibly, and yet, you know, you think, oh, it's engineers,

164
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
they're construction guys.

165
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You, you, maybe people don't, don't see them in the light of being legit combat warriors.

166
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And I'm here to tell you one hundred percent, without any shred of doubt.

167
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Those guys are hardcore combat warriors that have an incredibly tough job.

168
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And obviously, the American engineers have been just outstanding World War II.

169
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I mean, and when I saw them in a body, they were a sight to be a whole without question.

170
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And same thing, like I said, I've talked about the artillery, they used artillery in, in

171
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Ramadi, who as well, which was, which was, it was pretty cool for me, right?

172
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Because, you know, I always grew up watching World War II movies.

173
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And, and, you know, there I was in Ramadi, man,

174
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
we had tanks out there in the streets, but smashing through smashing through buildings and firing

175
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
their main gun rounds.

176
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And then we had engineers out there rebuilding bridges and building combat outposts.

177
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And then we had artillery that was firing counter battery out at the enemy that was shooting

178
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
mortars at us.

179
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And at night, sometimes we'd fire a lumenation rounds just like a big assault in the World War II.

180
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So it was very, well, I was, I feel very lucky to have been able to experience that

181
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that almost, you know, World War II type feeling now again, I'm not comparing anything that I did

182
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
do a veteran from World War II by any stretch of the imagination.

183
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But it was cool to get a little taste of it.

184
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Just a little, this, a little taste of it, just a little taste of it.

185
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And understand, I mean, I can't, you know, we were, you know, the, the,

186
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
imagine fighting against other troops that were as well trained as you are, which is what

187
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
you're doing in Germany when you're, when you're invading France, you're going against,

188
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I mean, the insurgents, they're, they're a hard fight, they're an enemy that I respect their capabilities,

189
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
but they're not as well trained or as well organized or as well led as, let's say, the German army

190
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
in World War II, right?

191
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So it's a tough enemy.

192
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And so as he continues through the book and as I said, I, this is a big thick book and I had to

193
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
really be selective about what to call out.

194
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He talks about the various phases of the war.

195
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
He talks pretty big chunk about the air war, but really it's all leading towards

196
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
one thing. It's all leading towards one event. It's all leading towards one invasion and that's

197
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
a day.

198
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And he spends time in England, you know, they're doing the preparation and they're having

199
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
their, doing what the Americans did in England when they were getting ready.

200
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And then finally, they get the word that the mission is going to commence.

201
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And we'll go to the book.

202
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
We felt our chances were not very good and we were not happy about it.

203
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Men like Don Whitehead and Clark Lee, who had been through the mill so long and so boldly,

204
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
began to get nerves.

205
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Frankly, I was the worst of a lot and continued to be.

206
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I began having terrible periods of depression and often would dream hideous dreams.

207
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
All the time fear lay blackly deep upon our consciousness.

208
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
It wore down on our hearts like an all-consuming weight.

209
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
People would talk to us and we wouldn't want to hear what they were saying.

210
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Now those, again, those are the correspondence.

211
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Those are the war correspondence.

212
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
That's the guy who he's talking about.

213
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
They, when they bring them together, they're talking like a squad or a platoon of war correspondence.

214
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And they are scared to death.

215
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
The Army said they would try and give us 24 hours notice of departure.

216
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Actually, the call came at nine o'clock one morning and we were ordered to be in a certain place with full field kit at 10 30 AM.

217
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
We threw our stuff stuff together.

218
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Probably a smart way to do it.

219
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You know, hey, we'll give you 24 hours advance notice.

220
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Don't worry, you know, we'll let you know.

221
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Hey, report an hour.

222
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Because, because, and he's going to talk about this,

223
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
the waiting isn't, isn't, is not good.

224
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
That is, that is the stress part.

225
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And it's the same thing with everything.

226
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Anything that, actually, you know, like a Gigietsu tournament,

227
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
when you're waiting to compete, that's the worst part.

228
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Once you, once you go, okay, your mind is free.

229
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And you're just doing what you do.

230
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Even during a workout.

231
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
If you've got a hard workout that you're going to do, you're dreading it.

232
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And I do this.

233
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I'll be like, like, if I have squats.

234
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And I'm sitting there, I'll make all kinds of, maybe I need to stretch a little bit more.

235
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
And you know what, let me just grab a little bit more water.

236
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And then let me check the line up of the music that's going to play and just make sure that that's good to go.

237
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And, oh, no, no, is this bumper plate looking straight?

238
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I'm going to straighten that out.

239
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So you just sit there and have it all.

240
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And then finally walk over.

241
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
You press your start and your stop watch.

242
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
And then there's no stopping.

243
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You just go.

244
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
And it half an hour later.

245
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The deed is done.

246
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
You know, but the waiting.

247
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Yep.

248
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
It's good.

249
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Yeah.

250
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
If it's going down, let's get it over with kind of thing.

251
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Yeah.

252
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You know what?

253
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
This is that Shakespeare court that I read one time on here.

254
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
With that moment in between taking the action.

255
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
And when you think of the action, and when you take the action, that moment is an eternity.

256
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Yeah.

257
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And a mess.

258
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
So you got to close the distance on that thing.

259
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Which is exactly what they did.

260
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Oh, we'll give you 24 hours.

261
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
No, I'm going to close the distance.

262
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
You got an hour after.

263
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Yeah.

264
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
You're with your gear.

265
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Ready to get it on.

266
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Back to the book.

267
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Bill Stoneman, another correspondent who had been wounded once, never showed the slightest concern.

268
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Whether he felt any concern or not, I could not tell.

269
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Bill had a humorous, sardonic manner while we were waiting for departure into the unknown.

270
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
He took out a pencil and a notebook.

271
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
As though starting to interview me.

272
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tell me, Mr. Pile, how does it feel to be an assault correspondent?

273
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Being a man of few words.

274
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I said, it feels awful.

275
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:57.000
We had hardly got a board when the lines were cast off and we pulled out.

276
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
That evening, the Colonel commanding the troops on our ship gave me the whole invasion plan in detail.

277
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
The secret, the whole world had waited years to hear.

278
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Once a man had heard it, it became permanently part of it.

279
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
He became permanently part of it.

280
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Then he was committed.

281
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
He was too late to back out, even if his heart failed him.

282
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I asked a good many questions.

283
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I realized my voice was shaking when I spoke, but I couldn't help it.

284
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Yes, it would be tough the Colonel admitted.

285
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Our own part would be precarious.

286
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
He hoped to go in with his few casualties as possible.

287
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
But there would be casualties.

288
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
From a vague anticipatory dread, the invasion now turned into a horrible reality for me.

289
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000
In a matter of hours, the Holocaust of our own planning would swirl over us.

290
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
No man could guarantee his own fate.

291
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
It was almost too much for me.

292
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
A feeling of utter desperation obsessed me throughout the night.

293
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:17.000
It was nearly 4am before I got to sleep, and then it was a sleep harassed and torn by an awful knowledge.

294
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
My devastating sense of fear and depression disappeared when we approached the beachhead.

295
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:34.000
There was the old familiar crack and roar of big guns all around us, and the shore was a great brown haze of smoke and dust.

296
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And we knew that the bombers would be over us that night, yet all the haunting premonition, the soul consuming dread was gone.

297
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
The war was perzeic to me again.

298
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And I believe that was true of everyone aboard, even those who had never been in combat before.

299
00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Again, once this gig kicks off, all that horror is gone, and now it's time to get the job done.

300
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:09.000
So, when you're out there in the world, and you're feeling that dread and your feeling that hesitation just step.

301
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Go.

302
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It's not helping you to sit around to be nervous.

303
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
It's not helping you to see if you need another little sip of water before we start doing what you're doing.

304
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:26.000
There's bad news to deliver in your business. There's no sense in doing another pace lap outside the room where people are waiting to hear from you.

305
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Get in and get it going.

306
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Now, he does a great job here telling about how hard this actually was.

307
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Because you know, we go, oh, D-D-A-Y-A. Oh, yeah, it was a tough fight.

308
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Here's some detail on that.

309
00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I want to tell you what the opening of the second front in that one sector entails so that you can know and appreciate and forever be humbly grateful to those both dead and alive who did it for you.

310
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000
A sure facing us were more enemy troops than we had in our assault waves.

311
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
The advantages were all theirs. The disadvantages all ours.

312
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:19.000
The Germans were dug into positions. They had been working on for months, although they were not entirely complete.

313
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:29.000
A 100 foot bluff, a couple of hundred yards back from the beach, had had great concrete gun emplacements built right into the hilltop.

314
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
These open to the sides instead of the front, thus making it hard for naval fire from the sea to reach them.

315
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
They could shoot parallel to the shore and cover every foot of it from miles with artillery fire.

316
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
A hundred foot cliff, by the way.

317
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Just don't, let's not even worry about the enemy. A hundred foot cliff after you come out of the water.

318
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
That's what you're facing. Then you put in pill boxes and you put Germans in those pill boxes.

319
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
By the way, more Germans in their are Americans.

320
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
It's a nightmare back to the book.

321
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Then they had hidden machine gun nests on the forward slopes with crossfire taking in every inch of the beach.

322
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
These nests were connected by networks of trenches so that the German gunners could move about without exposing themselves.

323
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Throughout the length of the beach running zigzag, a couple hundred yards back from the shoreline,

324
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
one is an immense V-shaped ditch 15 feet deep.

325
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Nothing could cross it, not even meant on foot until it filled until fills had been made.

326
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
And in other places at the far end of the beach where the ground was flatter, they had concrete walls.

327
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
These were blasted by our naval gunfire or by explosives by hand after we got ashore.

328
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Our only exits from the beach were several swales or valleys each one about a hundred yards wide.

329
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
The Germans made the most of those funnel-like traps, sowing them with buried mines.

330
00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:02.000
They also contained barbed wire entanglement with mines attached hidden ditches and machine guns firing from the slopes.

331
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
This is just it's it's unbelievable.

332
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
It's unbelievable.

333
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
The amount of defenses that were in place and the fact that we pushed through it.

334
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
And I humbly use the term we.

335
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.000
All this was done on the shore, but our men had to go through a maze nearly as deadly before they even got ashore.

336
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Under water obstacles were terrific, under the water the Germans had whole fields of evil devices to catch our boats.

337
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Several days after landing we had cleared only channels through them, and still could not approach the whole length of the beach with our ships.

338
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Even then some ship or boat would hit one of those mines and be knocked out of commission.

339
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:59.000
The Germans had masses of great six pronged spiders made of railroad iron and standing shoulder high just beneath the surface of the water for a landing craft to run into.

340
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
They had huge logs buried in the sand pointing upward and outward.

341
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Their tops just below the water.

342
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Attached to the logs were mines.

343
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
In addition to these obstacles they had floating mines offshore, land mines buried in the sand of the beach and more mines checkerboard in checkerboard road.

344
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
In checkerboard rows in the tall grass beyond the sand.

345
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
The end, the enemy had four men on shore for every three men we had approaching the shore.

346
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And yet we got on.

347
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Going against a defended position is so very difficult.

348
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:49.000
The odds were in in docked in urban warfare. You're supposed to have ten men for every one defender.

349
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Ten men for every one defender. And here we were out and out man.

350
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Against a heavily defended fortified position.

351
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
So how do you do it? Well back to the book.

352
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
As one officer said the only way to take a beach is to face it and keep going.

353
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
It is costly at first but that is the only way.

354
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
If the men are pinned down on the beach dug in and out of action, they made as well not be there at all.

355
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000
They hold up the waves behind them and nothing is being gained.

356
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So are the war sons who attack what guess what?

357
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:37.000
You just only one way to do this. You gotta do it.

358
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And now he talks about as the carnage.

359
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
After the afflian initial beach head had been taken, he talks about some of the carnage that remains there.

360
00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:04.000
In this shoreline museum of carnage, there were abandoned roles of barbed wire and smashed boulder dozers and big stacks of thrown away life belts and piles of shells still waiting to be moved.

361
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
In the water floated empty life rafts and soldiers packs and ration boxes and mysterious oranges.

362
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:21.000
On the beach lay snarred roles of telephone wire and big rules of steel madding and stacks of broken rusting rifles.

363
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000
But there was another and more human litter.

364
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It extended in a thin little line, just like a high water mark from miles along the beach.

365
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:41.000
This was the stroom personal gear that would never be needed again by those who fought and died to give us our entrance into Europe.

366
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
There in a jumbled role for mile on mile, were soldiers packs.

367
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
There were socks and shoe polish sewing kits, diaries, bibles, hands-groomed hand grenades.

368
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
There were the latest letters from home, with the address on each one neatly razored out.

369
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
One of the security precautions enforced before the boys embarked.

370
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.000
There were toothbrushes and razors and snapshots and families back home staring up at you from the sand.

371
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000
There were pocketbooks, metal mirrors, extra trousers, and bloody abandoned shoes.

372
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:28.000
There were broken handleed shovels and portable radio smashed almost beyond recognition and mind detectors twisted and ruined.

373
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:38.000
There were torn pistol belts and canvas water buckets, first aid kits, and jumbled heaps of life belts.

374
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I picked up a pocket Bible with a soldier's name in it and put it in my jacket.

375
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I carried it half a mile or so and then put it back down on the beach.

376
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I don't know why I picked it up or why I put it down again.

377
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Soldiers carry strange things with them, ashore.

378
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
In every invasion there's at least one soldier hitting the beach at eight hour with a banjo slung over a shoulder.

379
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000
The most ironic piece of equipment marking our beach, the first this beach, first of despair, then a victory, was a tennis racket.

380
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
That some soldier had brought along.

381
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
It lay lonely on the sand clamped and it's press, not a string broken.

382
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Two of the most dominant items on the beach refuse. In the beach refuse were cigarettes and riding paper.

383
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Each soldier was issued a carton of cigarettes just before he started.

384
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000
That day those cartons by the thousand water soaked and spilled out marked the line of our first savage blow.

385
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Riding paper and air mail envelopes came second.

386
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
The boys intended to do a lot of writing in France.

387
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Imagine the letters. Now forever incapable of being written.

388
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
That might have filled those blank abandoned pages.

389
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Now talking a little bit about the German prisoners as they start to roll up German prisoners.

390
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Some of the German officers were pleased at being captured.

391
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
But the died in the wool Nazi was not.

392
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000
They brought in a young one who was furious. He considered it thoroughly unethical for us to fight so hard.

393
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That's right.

394
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Did you hear the rest of it?

395
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
He thought it was unethical how hard the Americans fought.

396
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
The Americans had attacked all night and the Germans don't like a night attacks.

397
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
We're coming to get you.

398
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And this special fellow was brought in when this special fellow was brought in. He protested in rage. You Americans the way you fight.

399
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
That is this is not war. This is madness.

400
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
The German was so outraged she never even got the irony of his own remarks.

401
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
That madness though it were. It worked.

402
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Another high ranking officer was brought in and the first thing he asked was the whereabouts of his personal orderly.

403
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
When told that his orderly was better than a macro.

404
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
He flew off the handle and accused us of depriving him of his personal comfort.

405
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Who's going to dig my foxhole for me? He demanded.

406
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
A little German aristocracy going on in the ranks.

407
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
But what a what a testament.

408
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
You know, I was just kind of talking about how tough the Germans were, which they certainly were.

409
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But here's the Germans saying,

410
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Good Lord, it's unatholic that you fight this hard. That's right.

411
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
The Germans thought they were rolling light.

412
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
You know, hey, let's roll light.

413
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
The Americans were like, now we're going to 80cc.

414
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Yeah, no, no. It's on the same old championships.

415
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Literally the world championships.

416
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I always, you know, American the American fighting spirit is a powerful power for force.

417
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And sometimes people don't recognize that because you know what?

418
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
We're living here pretty good and even back then.

419
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Now we're coming out of the depression.

420
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
So you did have some hard life in America.

421
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
But you can trace that pre-depression.

422
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Americans fight hard.

423
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
There's no doubt about it.

424
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And I've personally witnessed the spirit of the American soldier.

425
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
And it is a damn impressive thing.

426
00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Going to get into some, well, the name of the chapter here is Street Fighting.

427
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
One of the favorite generals among war correspondence was Major General Manten S Eddie,

428
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Commander of the 9th Division.

429
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
We liked him because he was absolutely honest with us because he was sort of an old shoe and easy to talk with.

430
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
And because we thought he was a mighty good general.

431
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
General Eddie looked more like a school teacher than a soldier.

432
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
He was a big tall man, but he wore glasses in his eyes had a sort of squint.

433
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Being a mid-westerner, he talked like one.

434
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
He still claims Chicago is home, although he'd been an army officer for 28 years.

435
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
He was wounded in the last war.

436
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
He was not glib, but he talked well and laughed easily.

437
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And despite it being a professional soldier, he despised war and like any ordinary soul was appalled by the waste and tragedy of it.

438
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000
He wanted to win and get home just as badly as anybody else.

439
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
General Eddie, especially like to show up in places where his soldiers wouldn't expect to see him.

440
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Little leadership lessons right now from General Eddie.

441
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Nothing wrong with smiling.

442
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Talking with the boys, knowing what's going on.

443
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
And then boom, show up in places where his soldiers wouldn't expect to see him.

444
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
He knew it helped the soldiers spirits to see their commanding general right up there at the front where it was hot.

445
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
So he walked around the front with his long stride, never ducking or appearing to be concerned at all.

446
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
One day I rode around with him on one of his tours.

447
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
We stopped at a command post and we're sitting on the grass under a tree looking at maps with a group of officers around us.

448
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Our own military was banging nearby, but nothing was coming our way.

449
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Then like a flash of lightning, there came a shell just over our head so low it went right through the tree tops it seemed.

450
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It didn't whine it wished.

451
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
It's wished.

452
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Everybody including full kernels flopped over and began grabbing grass.

453
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
The shell exploded in the next orchard.

454
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
General Eddie didn't move.

455
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
He just said, that was one of our shells.

456
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
The general also like to get up before a clock in the morning.

457
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Once in a while to go poking around into the message genders and mess halls, given the boys a start.

458
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Sounds like he was a little bit of an early riser.

459
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
He was trying to be up before the enemy.

460
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
He was definitely up before the enemy.

461
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Well apparently, you know, the Germans they were saying, hey, you're not.

462
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
He's impressed over here.

464
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:40.000
During the Shearborg Peninsula campaign, I spent nine days with the ninth infantry division, the division that cut the peninsula.

465
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And one of the three that overwhelmed the great port of Shearmooosh.

466
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
The ninth is one of our best divisions.

467
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
It landed in Africa and fall through Tunisia and Sicily.

468
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Then it went to England in the fall of 1943 and trained on a winner for the invasion of France.

469
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:03.000
It was one of the American divisions in the invasion that had previous battle experience.

470
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
The ninth did something in that campaign that we hadn't always done in the past.

471
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
It kept tenaciously on the enemy's neck.

472
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
When the Germans grew with trawl little, the ninth was right on top of them.

473
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
It never gave them a chance to reassemble or get their balance.

474
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
The ninth moved so fast, it got to be funny.

475
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
I was based at the division command post and we struck our tents and moved forward six times in seven days.

476
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
That worked the daylights out of the boys who took down and put up the tents.

477
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
I overheard one of the boys saying, I'd rather be with wringling brothers.

478
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
But that's a little strategic importance there.

479
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
The ninth was just, oh, we're going to get you and we're going to come after you and we're not going to stop.

480
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
You're not going to get a chance to recover, you're not going to get a chance to rest.

481
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Sometimes you've got to go in that mode, no matter what you're doing in life.

482
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Sometimes you've got to go in that mode.

483
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
You don't back off and I'll say what you want to rest.

484
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
People want to rest.

485
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
But sometimes you can't.

486
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Sometimes you need to keep the pressure on.

487
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Kind of like you and Twitter.

488
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Yes, had to keep some pressure on.

489
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000
One day I went along quite accidentally. I assure you with an infantry company that had been assigned to clean out a pocket in the suburbs of share boorish.

490
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Since the episode was typically of the way an infantry advance into the city held by a company and enemy,

491
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
I would like to try and give you a picture of it.

492
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So he's going to try and like explain what that was like.

493
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
The soldiers around us had two weeks.

494
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Growth of beard and before he talks about the assault he kind of gives you a little update on this other frontline infantry troops.

495
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
The soldiers around us had two weeks growth of beard.

496
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Their uniforms were worn, worn slick and very dirty.

497
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
The uncomfortable gas impregnated clothes.

498
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
They'd come assure it.

499
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Come, come assure it.

500
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
The boys were tired.

501
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
They had been fighting and moving constantly forward on foot for nearly three weeks without rest.

502
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Sleeping on the ground, wet most of the time, always tense, eating cold rations, seeing their friends die.

503
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:22.000
One of them came up to me and said almost belligerently, why don't you tell the folks back home what this is like?

504
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
All they hear about is victories and a lot of the glory stuff.

505
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
They don't know that for every hundred yards we advance somebody gets killed.

506
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Why don't you tell them how tough this life is?

507
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I told them that I tried to do that all the time.

508
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
This fellow was pretty fed up with it all.

509
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
He said he didn't see why his outfit wasn't sent home.

510
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
They had done all the fighting.

511
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
That wasn't true at all.

512
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
For there were other divisions that had fought more and taken heavier casualties.

513
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Exhaustion will make a man feel like that.

514
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
A few days rest usually has him smiling again.

515
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
We've heard this time and time again.

516
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Sometimes you start to get that mental fatigue.

517
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
You have to take a little breather.

518
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Sometimes you have to keep the pressure on.

519
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
But if you start to break people, maybe it's time, especially an individual.

520
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And Dick Winner did this.

521
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Banda Brothers, Dick Winner's beyond the band of brothers.

522
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
He talked about, hey, we got this guy that's a little losing the bubble.

523
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Pull him back.

524
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
He got some admin stuff to do in the rear.

525
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And take care of that boom, done. Let this guy heal up.

526
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
That's what this guy needs. He needs a break. He needs a rest.

527
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And here we get the little briefing.

528
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Little briefing from the lieutenant, who's going to tell him how they're going to push through this little

529
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and clear out this little pocket of enemy resistance.

530
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
This is how we'll do it.

531
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
The lieutenant said, a rifle-potune goes first.

532
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Right behind them, we'll go a part of the heavy weapons-potune with machine guns to cover the first-potune.

533
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Then comes another rifle-potune.

534
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Then a small section with mortars in case they run into something pretty heavy.

535
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Then another rifle-potune.

536
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
And bringing up the rear, the rest of the heavy weapons-out fit to protect us from behind.

537
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
We don't know what we're running to.

538
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And I don't want to stick right out in front.

539
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So why don't you come along with me?

540
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
So he's talking to Ernie Pile at that point saying, listen.

541
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
I don't know what's going to be up front. You stick with me.

542
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
We'll go in the middle of the company.

543
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
I said, okay.

544
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
By this time, I wasn't scared.

545
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
You sell them our once you're into something.

546
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Anticipation is the worst.

547
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Fortunately, this little 4A came up so suddenly there wasn't time for much anticipation.

548
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
The waiting.

549
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
So they take, they start taking a little fire and finally the shell stop.

550
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And here we go. The shell stopped and finally the order to start was given.

551
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
As we left the protection of the high wall, we had to cross a little culvert right out in the open

552
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
and then make a turn in the road.

553
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
The men went forward one at a time.

554
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
They crouched and ran ape-like.

555
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Ape-like across this dangerous space.

556
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Then beyond the culvert, they filtered to either side of the road stopping and squatting down

557
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
every now and then to wait a few moments.

558
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
The lieutenant kept yelling at them as they started.

559
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Sprint it out now.

560
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Do you want to draw fire at yourselves?

561
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Don't punch up like that. Keep five yards apart.

562
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Spread it out, damn it.

563
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
There's an almost irresistible pull to get close to somebody when you're in danger.

564
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000
And spite of themselves, the men would run up close to the fellow ahead of them for company.

565
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
But obviously if you're close to your close to people and one bullet can kill two people.

566
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
But you get hit with a bomb, you get hit with a grenade, you're going to kill multiple people.

567
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
So you want to disperse, you want to keep your dispersion, you'll spread out.

568
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
But there's this little thing that people want to just get close to other people.

569
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
And everybody knows it's wrong.

570
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
And actually if you remember in the beloved captain, that's what he was constantly saying,

571
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
guys, spread out in the trench.

572
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Don't, hey, don't punch up and the author would say,

573
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
we all just wanted to huddle together.

574
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
You want to get close together, you're in fear.

575
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
So you want to huddle, and it's the wrong move.

576
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Now we get into a description of the men

577
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
as they're making this cross.

578
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
The men didn't talk amongst themselves.

579
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
They just went.

580
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
They weren't heroic figures as they moved forward one at a time, a few seconds apart.

581
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
You think of attackers as being savage and bold.

582
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
These men were hesitant and cautious.

583
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
They were really the hunters, but they looked like the hunted.

584
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
There was a confused excitement in the grim anxiety in their faces.

585
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
They seemed terribly pathetic to me.

586
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
They weren't warriors.

587
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000
They were American boys who by mere chance of fate had wound up with guns in their hands,

588
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
sneaking up death-laden street in a strange and shattered city in a faraway country,

589
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
in a driving rain.

590
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
They were afraid.

591
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
But it was beyond their power to quit.

592
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
They had no choice.

593
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
They were good boys.

594
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I talked with them all afternoon as we sneak slowly and were along with the serious and rubbed street,

595
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
and I know they were good boys.

596
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:36.000
And even though they want warriors born to kill, they won their battles.

597
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
That's the point.

598
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Regular guys.

599
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
World War II.

600
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Regular guys.

601
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And it's not depicted.

602
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
They'll throw a character like that into a movie.

603
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
You know, oh, he's, you know, just looks like a regular guy.

604
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
But most of the guys don't, the little ones are regular guys.

605
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
They look like badass warrior heroes guys.

606
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
And it's such a, you don't hear this description where he's literally saying,

607
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
they weren't warriors.

608
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
They seem terribly pathetic. And so you picture these guys.

609
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
They got this scared, strange look on their face and guess what?

610
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
They do their job.

611
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And they do it well.

612
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Yeah, it's strange.

613
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
It's almost like you can look at them in both ways.

614
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Because on one hand, they're just regular guys.

615
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
But when you see them in action kind of thing,

616
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
you're like, oh, dang.

617
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
They're getting out of their warriors, you know?

618
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Like true.

619
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I mean, I, I clearly, they're warriors that like he said,

620
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
they win their battles.

621
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
And even what they're doing right now,

622
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
takes massive courage.

623
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
You're just getting ready to step across the street where you know this is a machine gun.

624
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Fire could open up and take your life or take your legs or, you know, wound you.

625
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
That, that takes some will.

626
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
That takes some discipline.

627
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Yeah, I mean, how can you not just cover in the first corner you see really, you know,

628
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
when you compare it to everyday life?

629
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Man, I mean, I hate to, I hate to, but I can't help but compare it to the same

630
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
private right in that, that movie.

631
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Right.

632
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
And, and there's a part where they indicate that everyone's been trying to guess.

633
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
The job of the, oh, yes, Miller, whatever.

634
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
They're trying to guess it, right?

635
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
And so that was like an exposure of, like, yeah, this is the human.

636
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Back in the, yeah, you know, back in the, you know, back in the, and then he's like, yeah,

637
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I'm a school teacher and all this stuff, all this like normal stuff.

638
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
And then meanwhile, as the movie kind of program,

639
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
you see him in action, it's like, dang, for a school teacher, these guys are, you know,

640
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.000
they're really getting the job done.

641
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Well, tell you, man, we were, when I first got to her body, we were there with the,

642
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the two, two, eight, which is a, which is a reserve unit from Pennsylvania.

643
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Iron soldiers and led by a guy at the time was named Colonel Gronsky.

644
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
He's now a general, but those guys were school teachers.

645
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
They were, I mean, because they were a service.

646
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
So there was guys, they were, school teachers, there was guys there.

647
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Well, plumbers, there was guys there that cable and stollers,

648
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
there were guys there that were mechanics, there was guys there that were lawyers.

649
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
They're just every job.

650
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Yeah. And yet these guys were there fighting and getting after it,

651
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
by the way, it's a battle hardened.

652
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Yeah. And really, they were, they were so impressive.

653
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
We were so humbled by these guys.

654
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
These reserves, they were badass.

655
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Yeah.

656
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Nothing, but again, nothing but respect and, and admiration for them on the battlefield.

657
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Yeah, I'm seeing that exactly where, if, let's say you didn't know their job outside of the,

658
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
you know, the battle.

659
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And you see them, you're like, tank, these guys are straight up.

660
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
This is their thing. This is what they're, their primary career is, you know?

661
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Yeah.

662
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
That's what it seems like.

663
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000
And I'll tell you, I mean, I just was out in Mississippi.

664
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
And I was with a bunch of guys that were a reserve, some Mississippi.

665
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And one of the guys I was talking to, I mean, multiple guys that I was talking to,

666
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
they had multiple deployments to Iraq.

667
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
And, and these are 12 month deployment, 14 month deployments.

668
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
These guys were awesome.

669
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Awesome guys. Awesome professionals to who had taken the flight to the enemy.

670
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:16.000
So it's amazing that, that America has these, these reserves that live their lives.

671
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
And then, oh, by the way, you're going to go on deployment to Iraq for 14 months right now

672
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
and get after it. And then you're going to come back and go into your normal job.

673
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Yeah, follow me back in.

674
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Yeah, and go and just be straight up effective.

675
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Yeah.

676
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Not like they're like, timid, you know?

677
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Cause I'm, hey, I'm just here for 14 months.

678
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
That home, I'm, you know, I work at office with it. They're like, nope.

679
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Watch me work.

680
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Watch me get it, watch me get it on.

681
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
So, we get to a point now.

682
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
You know, that street flight continues.

683
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
They take down, they clear that pocket.

684
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
There's more combat description.

685
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
But now they're getting ready to push out of Normandy Beach outlay.

686
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
They've, so they've taken the beach. They've secured it. They've taken some hedgeros.

687
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
They've got it locked in. It's been, it's been, you know, some time.

688
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
But now they're getting ready to start making the push, making the push out of there.

689
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:15.000
And so that's what this is. This is going to be a massive, massive attack.

690
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And they're getting ready to get a brief.

691
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And here we go back to the book.

692
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
The regimental Colonel stood in the center of the officers and went over the orders in detail.

693
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
The Italian commanders took down notes in their little books.

694
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Then General Bartner arrived.

695
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
The Colonel called attention.

696
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
And everybody stood rigid until the general gave them carry on.

697
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And it listed man ran to the mess truck and got a folding stool for the general to sit on.

698
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
He sat listening intently while the Colonel wound up his instructions.

699
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
The general stepped into the center of the circle.

700
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:58.000
He stood at a slouch on one foot with the other leg far out like a brace.

701
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
He looked all around him as he talked. He didn't talk long.

702
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:08.000
He said, this is one of the finest regiments in the American Army.

703
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
It was the last regiment out of France in the last war.

704
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
It was the first regiment in defence in this war.

705
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
It is spearheaded every one of the divisions attacks in Normandy.

706
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
It will spearhead this one.

707
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
For many years, this was my regiment.

708
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
And I feel very close to you and very proud.

709
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
The general's line face was a study in emotion.

710
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Sincerely and deep sentiment weren't every contour and they shown from his eyes.

711
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
General Bartner was a man of deep affections.

712
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000
The tragedy of war, both personal and in personal hurt him.

713
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
At the end, his voice almost broke.

714
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
And I for one had a lump in my throat.

715
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
He ended.

716
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
That's all.

717
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.000
God bless you and good luck.

718
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000
With that they begin this massive operation.

719
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.000
The first planes of the mass onslaught came over a little before 10 a.m.

720
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
They were the fighters and dive bombers.

721
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
The main road running cross-wise in front of us was their bomb line.

722
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
They were to bomb only on the far side of that road.

723
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Our infantry had been pulled back a few hundred yards from the near side of the road.

724
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Everyone in the area had been given the strictest orders to be in foxholes for high-level bombers can.

725
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.000
And do quite exclusively make mistakes.

726
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
So did you understand that right there?

727
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
So there's a very clear road.

728
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
And they say, listen, the bombers are going to be bombing the other side of that road.

729
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
But we're going to back further away from the road just in case something goes wrong.

730
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Just in case bombs get dropped early.

731
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Obviously this indicates I'm pointing that out for a reason because this is gets horrible.

732
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Our front lines were marked by long strips of colored cloth laid on the ground.

733
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:33.000
With colored smoke to guide our airmen during the mass bombers bombing.

734
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Dive bombers hit it just right.

735
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
We stood and watched them barrelled nearly straight down out of the sky.

736
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
They were bombing about a half a mile ahead of where we stood.

737
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
They came in groups diving in every direction.

738
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Perfectly timed one after another.

739
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Everywhere we looked, separate groups of planes were on their way down or on their way back up or slanting.

740
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:06.000
And then we were planting over for a dive or circling, circling, circling over our heads and waiting for their turn.

741
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
So I want you to picture what this is like.

742
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Picture what this is like.

743
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
And you don't picture that you're watching it in a movie because that's it.

744
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I understand that it's easy to picture it.

745
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Okay.

746
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000
I want you to put your mind in this situation.

747
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Can you imagine what that looks like?

748
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.000
These, the sky is basically filling with planes and they're making these incredibly aggressive attacks.

749
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And this piece, which I'm about to read a big chunk.

750
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:48.000
This is one of the most magnificent descriptions of war I have read.

751
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Here we go.

752
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
The air was full of sharp and distinct sounds of cracking bombs and the heavy rips of the planes,

753
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
machine guns and the splintering screams of diving wings.

754
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
It was all fast and furious yet distinct.

755
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:13.000
And then a new sound gradually droomed into our ears.

756
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
A deep sound and all encompassing with no notes in it.

757
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Just a gigantic faraway surge of doom like sound.

758
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000
It was the heavies.

759
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:32.000
And so now we're talking about the heavy bombers that are going to bring the thunder and there's so many of them

760
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:42.000
and they're so loud it just drones out every other sound until just this massive faraway surge of a doom like sound.

761
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
It was the heavies. They came from directly behind us.

762
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
At first they were the mirris dots in the sky.

763
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
We could see the clots of them against the far heavens.

764
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Too tiny to count individually they came on with a terrible slowness.

765
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:09.000
They came in flights of 12, three flights to a group and in groups stretched out across the sky.

766
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
They came in families of about 70 planes each.

767
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Maybe those gigantic waves were two miles apart.

768
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Maybe they were 10 miles. I don't know.

769
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:28.000
But I do know they came in constant procession and I thought it would never end.

770
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
What the Germans must have thought is beyond comprehension.

771
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
The flight across the sky was slow and studied.

772
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:50.000
I've never known a storm or a machine or any resolve of men that had about at the aura of such a ghastly relentnesses.

773
00:56:50.000 --> 00:57:01.000
I had the feeling that even had God appeared besiegingly before them in the sky with palms out stretched to persuade them back.

774
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:10.000
They would not have had the power within them to turn from their irresistible course.

775
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:20.000
This is just, that's such an incredible description of this impending doom.

776
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.000
I stood with a little group of men ranging from kernels to privates back to the stone farmhouse.

777
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Slit trenches were all around the edges of the farm yard and a dugout with a tin roof was nearby.

778
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
But we were so fascinated by the spectacle overhead that it never occurred to us that we might need the foxholes.

779
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
The first huge flight passed directly overhead and others followed.

780
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
We spread our feet and leaned far back trying to look straight up until our steel helmets fell off.

781
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:04.000
We'd cop our fingers around our eyes like field glasses for a clear review.

782
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
And then the bombs came.

783
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:19.000
They began like the crackle of popcorn and almost instantly swelled into a monstrous fury of noise that seemed surely to destroy all the world ahead of us.

784
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:28.000
From then on, from an hour and a half that had in it the agonies of centuries the bombs came down.

785
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
A wall of smoke and dust erected by them grew high in the sky.

786
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
It filtered along the ground back through our orchards.

787
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
It sifted around us and into our noses.

788
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
The bright day grew slowly dark from it.

789
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
By now everything was an indescribable culture of sounds.

790
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Individual noises did not exist.

791
00:58:53.000 --> 00:59:01.000
The thundering of the motors in the sky and the roar of bombs ahead filled all the space from noise on the earth.

792
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Our own heavy artillery was crashing all around us.

793
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Yet we could hardly hear it.

794
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
The Germans began to shoot heavy high-ackack.

795
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Great puffs of of it by the score speckled the sky until it was hard to distinguish smoke puffs from planes.

796
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
And then someone shouted that one of the planes was smoking.

797
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Yes, we could all see it.

798
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
A faint line of black smoke stretched straight from a mile behind one of them.

799
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000
And as we watched there were gigantic sweep of flame over the plane.

800
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:39.000
From nose to tail it disappeared in flame and it slanted slowly down and banked around the sky.

801
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:46.000
And great wide curves this way and that as rhythmically and graceously gracefully as in a slow motion waltz.

802
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Then suddenly it seemed to change its mind and swept upward steeper and steeper and ever slower until finally it seemed poised motionless on its own black pillar of smoke.

803
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And then just as slowly as it had turned over and dived for the earth.

804
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
A golden spearhead on the straight black shaft of its own creation.

805
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And disappeared behind the tree tops.

806
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.000
But before it was down there were more cries of there's another one smoking and there's a third one now.

807
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Shoots came out of some of the planes.

808
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Out of some came no shoots at all.

809
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
One of the white silk caught on the tail of a plane.

810
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Men with binoculars could see him fighting to get loose until flames swept over him and then a tiny black dot fell through space.

811
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
All alone.

812
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And all that time.

813
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
The great flat ceiling of the sky was roofed by other planes that didn't go down.

814
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Plowing their way forward as if there were no turmoil in the world.

815
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Nothing deviated them by the slightest.

816
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:05.000
They stalked on slowly and with a dreadful paw of sound as though they were seeing only something at a great distance and nothing existed between.

817
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:16.000
God how we admired those men up there and sickened for the ones who fell.

818
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Incredible.

819
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:28.000
It is possible to become so enthralled by some of the spectacles of war that man is momentarily captivated away from his own danger.

820
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That's what happened to our little groups of group of soldiers as we stood watching them mighty bombing.

821
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
But that benign state didn't last long.

822
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:48.000
As we watched their crept into our consciousness, a realization that the windrows of exploding bombs were easing back towards us.

823
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Flight by flight instead of gradually forward as the plan had called for.

824
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Then we were horrified by the suspicion that those machines high in the sky and completely detached from us were aiming their bombs at the smoke line on the ground.

825
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And a gentle breeze was drifting the smoke line back over us.

826
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
In indescribable kind of panic came over us.

827
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:24.000
We stood tensed in muscle and frozen and intellect watching each flight approaching Passover feeling trapped and completely helpless.

828
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:36.000
And then all of an instant the universe became filled with gigantic rattling of as it of huge right seeds in a mammoth dry gourd.

829
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I doubt that any of us had ever heard that sound before, but instinct told us what it was.

830
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It was bombs by the hundred hurtling down through the air above us.

831
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Many times I'd heard bombs whistle or swish or rustle, but never before had I heard bombs rattle.

832
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I still don't know what the explanation of it, but it was an awful sound.

833
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
We dived.

834
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Some got into a dugout.

835
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Others made fox holes and ditches and some got behind a garden wall, although which side would be behind was anybody's guess.

836
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I was too late for the dugout. The nearest place was a wagon shed which formed on one end of the stone house.

837
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
The rattle was right down upon us.

838
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I remember hitting the ground flat all spread out like the cartoons of people flattened by steam rollers.

839
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
And then squirming like an eel to get under one of the heavy wagon wagons in the shed.

840
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
An officer whom I didn't know was riggling beside me.

841
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
We stopped at the same time simultaneously feeling it was hopeless to move further.

842
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
The bombs were already crashing around us.

843
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
We lay with our head slightly up like two snakes staring at each other.

844
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I know it was in both our minds and in our eyes asking each other what to do.

845
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Neither of us knew.

846
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
We said nothing.

847
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We just lay, sprawled, gaping at each other in a few tile appeal.

848
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Our faces about a foot apart until it was over.

849
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:22.000
There is no description of the sound and fury of those bombs except to say it was chaos and a waiting for darkness.

850
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
The feeling of the blast was sensational.

851
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
The air struck us and hundreds of continuing flutters are ears drummed and rang.

852
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
We could feel quick little waves of concussion on our chest and inner eyes.

853
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:42.000
That last the sound, the sound died down and we looked at each other in disbelief.

854
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Gradually we left the foxholes and sprawling places and came out to see what the sky had in store for us.

855
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
As far as we could see other waves were approaching from behind.

856
01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:02.000
When a wave would pass a little to the side of us, we were grateful for most of them food directly overhead.

857
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Time and time again the rattle came down over us.

858
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Bom struck in the orchard to our left.

859
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
They struck into the orchards ahead of us.

860
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
They struck as far as a mile behind us.

861
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Everything about us was shaken.

862
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But our group came through unheard.

863
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I can't record what any of us actually felt or thought during those horrible climaxes.

864
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I believe a person's feelings at such time are kaleidoscopic and indefensible.

865
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
He just waits.

866
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's all.

867
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
With an inhuman tenseness of muscle and nerves.

868
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:51.000
An hour or so later I began to get sore all over and by mid afternoon my back and shoulders ached as though I'd been beaten with a club.

869
01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It was simply the result of muscles tensing themselves too tight for too long against anticipated shock.

870
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:09.000
When we came out of our sprawling and stood up again to watch we knew that the error had been caught and checked.

871
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
The bombs were falling again where they were intended a mile or so ahead.

872
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Even at a mile away a thousand bombs hitting within a few seconds can shake the earth and shatter the air.

873
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:31.000
There was still a dread in our hearts, but it gradually eased as the tumult and destruction moved slightly forward.

874
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:38.000
It seems incredible to me that any German could have come out of that bombardment with insanity.

875
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:48.000
When it was over, even I was grateful in a chasened way that I had never experienced before for just being alive.

876
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I fought and attack by our troops was impossible then.

877
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Furt is an unnerving thing to be bombed by your own planes.

878
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:06.000
During the bad part a colonel had known a long time was walking up and down behind the farmhouse, snapping his fingers and saying over and over again to himself.

879
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Damn it, God damn it as he passed me once he stopped and stared and said God damn it.

880
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And I said, there can't be any attack now, can there? And he said no.

881
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And began walking against snapping his fingers and tossing his arms as though he were flowing rocks at the ground.

882
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000
The leading company of our battalion was to spearhead the attack 40 minutes after the heavy bombing ceased.

883
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.000
The company had been hit directly by our bombs. Their casualties, including casualties in shock were heavy.

884
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Men went to pieces and had to be sent back. The company was shattered and shaken.

885
01:07:47.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Yet company be attacked and on time to the minute they attacked and within the hour sent back word that they advanced 800 yards through German territory and were still going.

886
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Around our farm yard, men with stars on their shoulders almost wept when the word came over the portable radio.

887
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The American soldier can be majestic when he needs to be.

888
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I'm sure that back in England that night, other men bomber crews wept.

889
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:27.000
And maybe they did really in the awful knowledge that they had killed our own American troops.

890
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000
But the chaos and bitterness there in the orchards and between the hedgerodes that afternoon soon passed.

891
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:53.000
After the bitterness came, the sober remembrance that the Air Force was the strong right arm in front of us, not only at the beginning, but ceaselessly and everlasting the every moment of the faintest day like the Air Force was up there banging away ahead of us.

892
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Anybody bait mistakes, the enemy made them just the same as we did.

893
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
The smoke and confusion of battle be willed to us on the ground as well in the air.

894
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And in this case, the percentage of error was really very small compared to the colossal storm of bombs that fell upon the enemy.

895
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:21.000
The Air Force was wonderful throughout the invasion and the man on the ground appreciated it.

896
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
So obviously we talk about blue on blue a lot here.

897
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I think that's about as an extreme example as I've ever heard of.

898
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:41.000
And the blue on blue thing is such a nightmare because it's your own people.

899
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:48.000
It's your own people and it's a lack of communication and it's the fog of war.

900
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
And you can't do anything. You can't shoot back.

901
01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
All you can do is sit there and wait.

902
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And it's amazing one of those companies that was scheduled to attack is so shaken up that they can't go forward.

903
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
But then the other companies just go we got this step aside.

904
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Now the attack starts pushing forward and we get a little description of one of the commanders.

905
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The commander of the regiment was one of my favorites.

906
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
He was a regular army colonel and he was overseas in the last war too.

907
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
His division commander said the only trouble with him was that he got too bold.

908
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:36.000
And if you weren't careful, he was liable to get clip to some fine day.

909
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
When tired and dirty he could have played a movie gangster, but either way his eyes always twinkled.

910
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
He had a faculty for direct thought that was outstanding.

911
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
The colonel went from one battalion to another during the battle, during battle, from early light until darkness.

912
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
He wore a new, new type field jacket that fitted him like a sack and he carried a long stick that Teddy Roosevelt had given to him.

913
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:08.000
He kept constantly prodding his commanders to push hard not to let up and keep driving and driving.

914
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
He was impatient with his commanders who lost the main point of the war by getting involved in the details.

915
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
The main point of course being to kill Germans.

916
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.000
His philosophy of war was expressed in the simple formula of shoot the son of bitches.

917
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Once I was at a battalion command post when we got word that 60 Germans were coming down the road in the counter attack, everybody got excited.

918
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:39.000
They called the colonel on a field fold, gave him on the field phone, gave him details and asked him what to do.

919
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000
He had the solution to nut sell in a nut shell.

920
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
He said shoot the sons of bitches and hung up.

921
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Got to keep things simple.

922
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Then you got to keep your your tasks very focused.

923
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
You know what's all this complication?

924
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:06.000
We're here to kill Germans, so kill them sons of bitches.

925
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Now we get to a younger soldier that he goes through a description of.

926
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Clayton's weirdest disguiding Clayton's weirdest experience.

927
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We funny if it weren't so filled with pathos.

928
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
He was returning with a patrol one moonlit night when the enemy opened up on them.

929
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Tommy leaped right through a hedge and spotting a foxhole plunged into it.

930
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:36.000
To his amazement and fright there was a German in that foxhole sitting pretty holding a machine pistol in his hands.

931
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Clayton shot him three times in the chest before you could say, scat.

932
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000
The German hardly moved.

933
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And then Tommy realized the man had been killed earlier.

934
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
He had been shooting a corpse.

935
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:58.000
All his experiences seem to have had no effect on his mild on this mild soldier from Indiana,

936
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
except perhaps to make him even quieter than before.

937
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:11.000
The worst experience of all is just the accumulated blur and the hurting vagueness of being too long in the lines.

938
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
The everlasting alertness, the noise and fear, the cell by cell exhaustion.

939
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The thinning of surrounding ranks as day follows nameless day.

940
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And the constant marching to eternity of one's own small quota of chances for survival.

941
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Those are the things that hurt and destroy.

942
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:51.000
And soldiers like Tommy Clayton went back to them because they were good soldiers and they had a duty they could not define.

943
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Mental stress.

944
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Now they continue to push through, they take Paris and it's really incredible to hear what that was like.

945
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Then you should definitely buy this book and read it.

946
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
And here's how we close this it out.

947
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.000
The final chapter is being written in the latter part of August 1944.

948
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It is being written under an apple tree in a lovely green orchard on the interior of France.

949
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000
It could well be that the European war will be over and done by the time you read this book or it might not.

950
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But the end is inevitable and it cannot be put off for long.

951
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
The German is beaten and he knows it.

952
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:55.000
It will seem odd when at some given hour the shooting stops and everything suddenly changes again.

953
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It will be odd to drive down an unknown road without that little knot of fear in your stomach.

954
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Odd not to listen with animal like alertness for the meaning of every distant sound.

955
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Odd not to have your spirit.

956
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Odd to have your spirit released from the perpetual weight that is compounded of fear and death and dirt and noise and anguish.

957
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:36.000
The end of war will be a gigantic relief but it cannot be a matter of hilarity for most of us.

958
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Somehow it would seem sac religious to sing and dance when the great day comes.

959
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:49.000
There are so many who can never sing and dance again.

960
01:15:49.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Many, many thousands of Americans have come to join the ones who have already slept in France for a quarter of a century.

961
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000
For some of us the war has already gone on too long.

962
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Our feelings have been wrong and drained.

963
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They cringe from the effort of coming alive again.

964
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Even the approach of the end seems to have brought little inner elation.

965
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
It is only brought a tired sense of relief.

966
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000
I do not pretend that my own feeling is the spirit of our armies.

967
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
If it were we probably would not have the power to win.

968
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Most men are stronger.

969
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Our soldiers still can hate or glorify or be glad with true emotion.

970
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000
For them death has a pain and victory a sweet scent.

971
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
But for me war has become a fiat.

972
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Black depression without highlights a revulsion of the mind and an exhaustion of the spirit.

973
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:13.000
The war in France has been especially vicious because it was one of the enemies' last stands.

974
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
We have won because of many things.

975
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
We have won partly because the enemy was weakened from our other battles.

976
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.000
The war in France is our grand finale but the victory here is the result of all other victories that went before.

977
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It is a result of Russia and the Western Desert and the bombings and the blocking of the sea.

978
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
It is a result of Tunisia and Sicily and Italy.

979
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
We must never forget or belittle those campaigns.

980
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:50.000
We have won because we have had magnificent top leadership at home and in our allies and with ourselves overseas.

981
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Surely America made its two perfect choices in generalized and how we are in general Bradley.

982
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
They are great men to me doubly great because they are direct and kind.

983
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
We won because we are audacious.

984
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
One could not help but be moved by the colossus of our invasion.

985
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
It was a bold and mighty thing.

986
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
One of the epics of all history.

987
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
In the emergency of war our nation's powers are unbelievable.

988
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.000
The strength we have spread around the world is appalling even to those who make up the individual cells of that strength.

989
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I am sure that in the past two years I have heard soldiers say a thousand times if only we could have created all this energy for something good.

990
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
But we rise above our normal powers only in times of destruction.

991
01:18:47.000 --> 01:19:01.000
We have won this war because our men are brave and because of many other things because of Russia and England and the passage of time and the gifts of nature's materials.

992
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000
We did not win it because destiny created us better than all other peoples.

993
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I hope that in victory we are more grateful than we are proud.

994
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I hope we can rejoice in victory but humbly.

995
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.000
The dead men would not want us to gloat.

996
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The end of one war is a great feather broken from around our lives.

997
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
But there is still another to be broken.

998
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.000
The Pacific War may yet belong in bloody.

999
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Nobody can foresee but it will be disastrous to approach it with easy hopes.

1000
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Our next few months at home will be torn between the new spiritual freedom of half peace and the old grinding blur of half war.

1001
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
It will be a confusing period for us.

1002
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Thousands of men will be returning to you soon.

1003
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:15.000
They have been gone a long time and they have seen and done things and felt things you cannot know.

1004
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
They will be changed.

1005
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They will have to learn how to adjust themselves to peace.

1006
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Last night we had a violent electrical storm around our countryside.

1007
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:32.000
The storm was half over before we realized that the flashes and the crashes around us were not artillery.

1008
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
The plain old fashioned thunder enlightening.

1009
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
It will be odd to hear only thunder again.

1010
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:49.000
You must remember that such little thing says that are in our souls and will take time.

1011
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:59.000
And all of us together will have to learn how to reassemble our broken world into a pattern so firm and so fair that another great war cannot soon be possible.

1012
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:06.000
To tell the simple truth, most of us over in France don't pretend to know the right answer.

1013
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Sumersion war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the master of peace.

1014
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000
All we can do is fumble and try once more try out of the memory of our anguish.

1015
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And be as tolerant with each other as we can.

1016
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
In this book was dedicated by Ernie Pile,

1017
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I'm going to read the dedication now.

1018
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.000
In solemn salute to those thousands of our comrades,

1019
01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:07.000
it's great brave men that they were for whom there will be no homecoming ever.

1020
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And Ernie Pile did get to experience homecoming.

1021
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Unfortunately, it was not joyous and it was not long.

1022
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:39.000
He battled with depression and emotional turmoil over his experiences in war.

1023
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And you can hear him talking about those and also his wife who had some kind of mental issues.

1024
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:57.000
He'd actually been hospitalized and so he was distressed and depressed about that.

1025
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:04.000
And on top of that, the war was not over for him.

1026
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:12.000
And he mentioned there in the end that there's only half peace because there were still a war in the Pacific.

1027
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:22.000
He knew that. And in personal letters and in conversations that he had with his friends,

1028
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:27.000
he explained a personal foreboding,

1029
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
a sense that he would not live through the war.

1030
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:45.000
When he was asked by the Department of the Navy to join the Battle against Imperial Japan and the Pacific,

1031
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:57.000
he reluctantly may be fearfully but doodifully agreed to go.

1032
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And it was there. In the Pacific, on the tiny island called E. Sheema just off the coast of Okinawa,

1033
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:20.000
that Ernie Pile was shot and killed by a single sniper bullet.

1034
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And members of the 77th Infantry Division who he didn't know with for the operation quickly marked where he was killed with a sign that read at this spot.

1035
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:59.000
The 77th Infantry Division lost a body, Ernie Pile, on 18 April 1945.

1036
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:22.000
So Mr. Pile, thank you for your service and your sacrifice and to the journalists that are out there now in this day,

1037
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:32.000
especially the war journalists who take risks to record and report history.

1038
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Thank you for what you do.

1039
01:25:39.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Again, the book is called Brave Men by Ernie Pile, and it will give you some real insight into the nature of war.

1040
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Echo, the world is a crazy place. And it's amazing that you can live the life that we live.

1041
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:32.000
And some people go through life without ever even just brushing against this madness.

1042
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And I'll say this for the thousandth time. I believe that it is important to delve into these things so that you learn not just about leadership, but about life.

1043
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And how precious and glorious life is.

1044
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And life has ups and downs. It has good and bad. It has darkness and light. And everybody's life makes those transitions.

1045
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And having darkness in the world or in your life does not exclude the light.

1046
01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:55.000
In fact, I think it makes that light just a little bit brighter.

1047
01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And so when we, we don't have to stay here in the darkness, we can go. We've paid our respects, and we will continue to pay our respects as we go forward.

1048
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And with that, I guess it's a good time to answer some questions from the inner webs.

1049
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And actually, before we get into questions from the inner webs.

1050
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:50.000
And I'm going to say this for the inner webs, and I'm going to say this for the inner webs.

1051
01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Now, echo is going to say some stuff about the inner webs. And about supporting the podcast. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to like, I'm going to hit a switch.

1052
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I'll just get a little adjustment, a little mindset change, get into the zone for answering some questions. So there's there's actually a dual purpose for echoes discussion of how to support the podcast. Yes,

1053
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I suppose you have to support the podcast, which is much appreciated. Also, I can decompress for a minute from being bombed by my own planes from being stressed from being back in the war zone World War Two style.

1054
01:29:42.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I mean, you know, writers in general are just really good at explaining stuff. Yeah, I mean, yeah, pretty much all right. And you can see the difference in the way they man this one in particular really to me anyway, really, really delivered with the descriptions and stuff. And it was like, yeah, there's so many one liners in there.

1055
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:20.000
And when I was reading it, I have certain ways of I've certain ways of notating kind of what I'm going to read and that, you know, some of the stuff's just circled and somewhat. This now.

1056
01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But but occasionally, if something to me, if it hits me, I put one single red line underneath each individual word that I'm going to read.

1057
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And I normally, I might do that like once or twice a book, but there's a couple paragraphs where I had done it multiple times because those lines are just powerful.

1058
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Like the the one that I just opened the book back up to re-roll.

1059
01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I can't put it down. But you know, when he's like, um, and then a new sound gradually drawn into our ears, a sound deep and all encompassing with no notes in it, just a gigantic far away surge of doom like sound.

1060
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
And this is the part that I underlined.

1061
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
It was the heavies.

1062
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:25.000
And you know, this is the power of that, just knowing like these are the heavy bombers, which you know, it's no big deal to us now because we have giant machines, but a heavy bomber back then was like a.

1063
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It was just this ultimate modern machine that had been created that nothing could destroy what these things, nothing was close to it.

1064
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:44.000
And not only he created one of these insane power machines, we created hundreds and hundreds and actually we created thousands of them.

1065
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And they were all amassed and coming to destroy this little section.

1066
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
It was the heavies.

1067
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
God.

1068
01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Yeah. So yeah, it's a book that definitely draws you in and his writing that he, the fact that he writes a very straight forward, very, very plain and direct English is I think one of the things that makes it so powerful.

1069
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:17.000
I love how he compared where he compares like, and a lot of writers do this and when you can do it good, it's really powerful.

1070
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Like for example, the he talked about the the one plane that I think he got hit or was crashing and compared to big he said it was a spear light lit spear with the smoke trail.

1071
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Yeah, you can see exactly what that looks like, you know, just pull and it's weird to because a lot you can go watch this. I mean they have film footage of this stuff.

1072
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:57.000
But that that takes you there visually, but I think kind of reading and listening does it takes you there mentally. It takes you there in your head which is which is more which is more powerful than and this happens to me all the time when I'm when I'm reading and I'm getting better when we started this podcast.

1073
01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I could tell like, oh, that's powerful. Like, oh, yeah, that's going to be that's a really powerful statement. And then sometimes I would read it. It would be 12 more times more powerful where I'd be like, oh my god, it'd be just power because when you read it aloud and now I'm a little bit more aware that hey, you're going to have to read this.

1074
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Yeah, bro, you better get you better get your head in the game because it's going to be powerful. So that's something I've become more aware of as we've done this more more and as I've read all these books and gone through them and

1075
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:50.000
just read it online, the stuff and thought about the way it's going to sound and thought about what it means to say it was the heaviest awesome. So while I asked to decompress over here, go.

1076
01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I'll speak in the inner web and awesome. By the way, um, talk about supplements and we do a lot of the time at this time. So on it, right, best supplements. We all know that.

1077
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Even though we already know that that is a big deal because of the nature of just supplement companies in general. So rest assured on it, best one that's it.

1078
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And it supplement you can get 10% off because of the juggle link, which is on it dot com slash juggle 10% off boom supplement your wallet a little bit supplement your your body and

1079
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:48.000
your mind when you mind off a breading, off a brain for sure, but notably K I'm going to admit some I didn't take krill oil when to recently so mirror okay and in the in the spirit of extreme ownership apparently I was not clear enough to you.

1080
01:34:48.000 --> 01:35:04.000
I was just wondering I wanted to anyway all in the I didn't take that off a brain take juggle bring me krill oil now.

1081
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Yeah, you know, I think I said that a few times so now that you're on it okay so I take the krill oil and I'm not I'm not this guy who's like has all these nagging joint pains when I go workout because really that's really when I think okay do I've joint pain not I work out good hard a role to do so I don't have joint pain but here's the thing I do have joint pain.

1082
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I want to wake up in the morning and the thing is like I said when you're like when I think of when someone says you give joint pain I'm thinking when I work out that's it.

1083
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:51.000
I don't think like you know other times less there they're asking specifically so like my daughter she's three and half now she's kind of like a bigger three and half to and she comes runs up wakes me up a lot of times and is like hey carry me downstairs so when I sit up she jumps on my back.

1084
01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:03.000
She was 40 pounds. I'm not saying I'm you know the power lifter and nothing but 40 pounds is not okay 40 pounds I don't think he even has anywhere.

1085
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Yeah, no 40 my work is meaningless. Yeah.

1086
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:20.000
She's 40 pounds she jumps on the back and I'm like oh I got a focus like I got a focus on like my yeah just because of the stiffness not necessarily pain but just like stiff you know how like if you just didn't warm up at all you can just jump it's like that feeling.

1087
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
And then recently my ankle got jacked up.

1088
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And I have like I think this torn lumen so you gotta watch out for you.

1089
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Yeah, you know, but I it had already been jacked by the way. So it got foot locked and then it like inflamed it.

1090
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So now I got to walk downstairs with this girl on my back with my stiffness and I'm like oh hey no problem I do it almost every day no problem but let's face those are all kinds of

1091
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.000
challenge yeah, but I take the krill oil not the first day not even the second day but it was maybe a few days later she jumps on my back

1092
01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:03.000
I'm still working out hard by the way so it's not like oh you're good. She jumps on my back and I'm like dang I feel solid I can go like when I stand up on my boom popping up

1093
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
No disably

1094
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Reduced still there my ankle still there. I'm right now still but pro this was like I would say maybe four five days

1095
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And this is when I know I was like dang this is this is good krill oil is real. Yeah, and there's been a bunch of bunch of people on Twitter have come back and said hey I started taking krill oil and then you know a week later like man my shoulders good to go you know it really works so it does really work.

1096
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:38.000
It really does. Yeah, and that like I said that mean and here my wife's dad was like telling her long this is the years ago.

1097
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.50
No krill oil no one not fish show is good krill oils and I'm like really look up krill. It's a trim like oh sweet

1098
01:37:44.50 --> 01:37:50.000
It's joint pain it's all this stuff or whatever and like I said even back then right now same thing when I work I don't have joint pain

1099
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Maybe if I've a strain or something that's not joint pain

1100
01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:06.000
You know so I'm like good for you. Not yourself out with a krill oil when I need it then I'm gonna come on maybe I'll ask you about some stuff. So you know I see it and it's cool good, but this is the first time

1101
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Now you like I get I got you the krill us now you get that so when I run out, go ahead give me another krill oil. Okay. Yeah, that's clear. Yeah, let me know cool. Let me know.

1102
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I'll sell you so back to the book. What a four year bars and this is what we I think where bars are made out of buffalo meat they are they are yes they are we never said that. Oh, well my boss.

1103
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Is that even better? Yeah, because because you're eating buffalo which must have been the biggest property. Yeah, you stronger. Oh, yeah, but nonetheless to me that makes it even more awesome

1104
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Not because I mean not for any specific reason other than maybe novelty, but it's still pretty dope in my opinion. So still tastes really good

1105
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:00.000
That's for me a replacement someone asked me on Twitter. Hey, do you you know what meal replacement or protein shakes or whatever would you recommend if any.

1106
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:12.000
I said, no, yeah, well, that's what I said to someone said the same thing to me. Well, you know, you're in your replacement. I said, why would you replace a stay.

1107
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:27.000
If you're gross or disgusting or horrible, maybe you'd want to replace them. Yeah, or you don't have to look I'm driving a truck. Yeah, I'm driving a I don't know. I plan or something for a long time something. I want you drive my airplane. I'll be respect.

1108
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Okay, probably right. But but okay there you go. Where your borne. Yes, that's the answer right there. Oh, filler.

1109
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:54.000
They're not messing around and they're good. That's the thing. Like remember back in the day that the bars. Yeah, yeah, not even not back in the even right now. You want to those like, all right. I see where you're going. Whether you're trying to make it like a candy bar where you're trying to.

1110
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It's not like that at all. This is good.

1111
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Anyway, do worry, bro. So, uh, another way you can support the podcast in the event of you being in the mood to support the podcast is next time you chop and Amazon.com.

1112
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Click through one of our links. It's like a passive way.

1113
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Actively aggressively efficient way to support and super easy. Don't ask you anything. You click through you do your shopping.

1114
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Boom. It's like we get a little referral thing.

1115
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
But I like about that is because I don't want to ask people like a lot of people that want to donate money. I don't want you to donate money to us.

1116
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.000
If you want to give us money, that's awesome. But I'd rather you buy a t-shirt.

1117
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
If you can afford it, but if let's say you can't afford anything because you're broke.

1118
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:51.000
That's okay. When you order something from Amazon. This is just free money that you give to us. So it's all the way.

1119
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
It's almost like a collective like, hey, we all shop at Amazon and this thing together. You know, kind of thing.

1120
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.000
And Amazon is always the way to spare the change.

1121
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
They can spare a little something for the Jockel podcast.

1122
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000
You're actively making Amazon give us money. How's that for getting after it?

1123
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But then, but they're, you know, so it's like this weird circle almost.

1124
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
They, you know, they buy from Amazon. We're like, hey, go to Amazon.

1125
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
And Amazon's like, hey, thanks for buying. Thanks for sending them. We're supporting Amazon.

1126
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Whether it be books or whatever. Docta all this stuff.

1127
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
There's because we're making people want to buy stuff from Amazon. I books.

1128
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
You know, yeah.

1129
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
None of the last. Other things. People can be buying Jockel ID from Amazon too.

1130
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
We're just coming. So good.

1131
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000
You know, I got this one.

1132
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Brue.

1133
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It's so good. They came out so good.

1134
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I'm pumped.

1135
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Yeah.

1136
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Yeah. That's going to be solid there.

1137
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That is solid currently. That's solid. Yeah. But yeah, the Amazon. Anyway, yeah, it's support that way.

1138
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Like I always say, a big part of that or a big, not issue, but a thing in there is remembering to do it.

1139
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
If you want to do this, the remembering to do it. So do have what's called the trooper tool.

1140
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
All it is, you go. You download it.

1141
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
It's basically you click on it.

1142
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Amazon trooper or trooper tool, Chrome extension.

1143
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Click on it, accept it.

1144
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
It's on your thing. It automatically does it for you.

1145
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
From here on out.

1146
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Break it up.

1147
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
It's like a little official thing to break it up.

1148
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So solid. Um, and we were trying to update.

1149
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.000
I've been talking to them. We're trying to update it for Canada UK.

1150
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So they can have the tool for them. So as well.

1151
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
That's cool.

1152
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Because yeah.

1153
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Yeah.

1154
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
So we work it on that one.

1155
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
But there. Yeah. That's good.

1156
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Trooper tool. You don't have to remember anywhere. You remember it one time.

1157
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
That's all.

1158
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Chop it Amazon still support aggressively.

1159
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Officially.

1160
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And of course support by subscribing to the podcast on iTunes.

1161
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000

1163
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Yeah. That's legit.

1164
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
And of course, the juggle store.

1165
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Oh.

1166
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I think we're, I'm not, I think I know that we're trying.

1167
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
We are trying our best to provide.

1168
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Multi-dimensional items.

1169
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Like even in a simple t-shirt, this multiple dimensions to it.

1170
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
You know, it's not just, hey, that's a cool thing.

1171
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The saying is important and extends way beyond what you'd expect on the surface.

1172
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
That goes for all the shirts.

1173
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
So including the rash cards.

1174
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Including the rash cards. Okay. So new stuff.

1175
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
New stuff rash cards. The rash cards are good.

1176
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
This far as the fit. Of course.

1177
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
And the men.

1178
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
They're good.

1179
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And what's cool about.

1180
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I mean, here's the reality.

1181
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
When you, when you put on a uniform.

1182
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
When you put on a uniform, you change your mentality a little bit.

1183
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
This is factually.

1184
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Yeah.

1185
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And so when people are like, oh man, I was wearing the discipline.

1186
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
It was t-discipline.

1187
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.000
It was clean.

1188
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:03.000
It was clean.

1189
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I got my PR on clean and jerk.

1190
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
And I'm like, yeah.

1191
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Yeah.

1192
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
You put on your uniform.

1193
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And there's a mental state of mind that makes a little adjustment in the brain.

1194
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
You know, it's real funny about that.

1195
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Exact notion.

1196
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
When we first got the first shirt to this little Nicholas Freedom.

1197
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Put on the gray one.

1198
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And I get, I know that.

1199
01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
That thing. That's, it's a psychological thing.

1200
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Yeah.

1201
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
It's real.

1202
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Yeah.

1203
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.000
Which is, by the way, one of the most powerful things in your whole life psychological.

1204
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Anyway.

1205
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I put it on.

1206
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I was like, yeah, I'm going to take a picture.

1207
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
You know, of me in the new shirt kind of thing.

1208
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
And I put it on and I was going to work out anyway.

1209
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000
And man, I put it on.

1210
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:46.000
I was like, yeah, I felt that exact thing on the shirt that I made.

1211
01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
You know, anyway.

1212
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Yeah.

1213
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So true.

1214
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000
And the rash guard.

1215
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
I'm not going to go into the story.

1216
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
But put on the rash guard yesterday.

1217
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.000
You're working.

1218
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
You did see it worked out very well.

1219
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
I did very well.

1220
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
So there's some sort of a subliminal power.

1221
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Yeah.

1222
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
That you can gain.

1223
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Yes.

1224
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And then when I was thinking rash.

1225
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Is this false advertising?

1226
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Hey, if you wear this rash guard, your digital improved 19%.

1227
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
No, it's not false at all.

1228
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I'm not going to call it.

1229
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
Honestly, it's a different fall.

1230
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Here's what the end.

1231
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I went into the whole rash guard situation.

1232
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Like, oh, yeah, we need rash guards because people were saying, hey, you need

1233
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000
like this rash guards.

1234
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And they were due to, there was a demand sick.

1235
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:26.000
But here's the thing.

1236
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Like rash guards like the short sleeve.

1237
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Oh, man, this is like, if you go like biking and stuff, that's really what it's for.

1238
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
It's like biking across the, anything where you, you're like,

1239
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:37.000
What is it for?

1240
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It's certainly for surfing.

1241
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
That's really what rash guards are for.

1242
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I mean, you did see now because there's just no.

1243
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Well, we used to back in the day back in the day.

1244
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.000
We used to just wear, we would, if people were wearing rash guards, there was no such

1245
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
thing as the G.T. rash guard.

1246
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Right?

1247
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
There was only actual rash guards.

1248
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
You know, it is for body boarding.

1249
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
It's what it is because it's got a rash and surfing too.

1250
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Yeah.

1251
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
It means of water sports.

1252
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Yeah.

1253
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And my little brother, he's a dive reti, spear fishing, because dive grab, he's dope too.

1254
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.000
He got this.

1255
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Anyway, he's on quiet.

1256
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Same thing.

1257
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
You go diving, water foot.

1258
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
It's like that's what this is for.

1259
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Including, but not limited to jujitsu.

1260
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Yeah.

1261
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Jujitsu is a complete bonus on the tail end of that.

1262
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.000
But if you're clever, now these are specifically designed for jujitsu.

1263
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
There's, there's just multi-person.

1264
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Yeah.

1265
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
It might multi-purpose.

1266
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Yep.

1267
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.000
And straight up, if you wear it for jujitsu, you're going to do better.

1268
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Makein' that clean.

1269
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Straight up.

1270
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
A lot of it.

1271
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
I love it.

1272
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I've rolled with you while you're wearing it.

1273
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Yeah.

1274
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Good luck.

1275
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Good luck with that one.

1276
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
We will go to Jamie Meab.

1277
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Just recording.

1278
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Also new.

1279
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
That's out.

1280
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
His patches for jujitsu, for anything.

1281
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
They're just patches.

1282
01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
You can sew on their iron on, but you sew on so much.

1283
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
No, so much.

1284
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
So much.

1285
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Yeah.

1286
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Patches, discipline equals freedom.

1287
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
There is a jujitsu specific patch.

1288
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
It says jujitsu, you know, discipline.

1289
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Anyway, go on.

1290
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Jockelster.com, you can see him all.

1291
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
And women's shirts.

1292
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Women's shirts are new.

1293
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Oh, yeah.

1294
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Back to the patch is real quick.

1295
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So I got a recommendation for the Velcro one.

1296
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Yes.

1297
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Which is, bro, I don't even know why I didn't like it.

1298
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
You know, I can't you don't wear a hat.

1299
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Oh, yeah.

1300
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.000
You don't wear hats.

1301
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Yeah, but I was.

1302
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I wear a hat all the time.

1303
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I had, there's always a space for a patch on there.

1304
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So I'm going to put it on everything.

1305
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
There you go.

1306
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Anyway.

1307
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
What about the women's shirts?

1308
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Women's shirts.

1309
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Okay.

1310
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Yes.

1311
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Thank you Debbie and, you know, all you guys.

1312
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Every one of them.

1313
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Yeah.

1314
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Female troopers.

1315
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I got it.

1316
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Get that, Greg.

1317
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Yeah.

1318
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Lisa.

1319
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Oh, yeah.

1320
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Lisa.

1321
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Yeah.

1322
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
They're on you.

1323
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Yeah.

1324
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
They bring me.

1325
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
They bring very good input.

1326
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Yeah.

1327
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.000
And I think I'm, and I respect their tenacity.

1328
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Did you feel threatened?

1329
01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
No.

1330
01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.000
No.

1331
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I felt that we were all in this together.

1332
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
You know.

1333
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:02.000
Um, but yeah.

1334
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Thank you.

1335
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
So yes, they are coming here.

1336
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Here's the thing.

1337
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
They're not t-shirts.

1338
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
They're tank tops.

1339
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Cool.

1340
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Do we want t-shirts?

1341
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.000
I don't know.

1342
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
If we do, then we're going to ask you shirts as well.

1343
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Good.

1344
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Ask females.

1345
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Female troopers.

1346
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Maybe we'll do a pink.

1347
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
We will not.

1348
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Maybe we will, though.

1349
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
That's the thing.

1350
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
We will not.

1351
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
Either way, they are in the literally in the works.

1352
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Sommitted.

1353
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Is that Lisa's like pink pink pink pink?

1354
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Yeah.

1355
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Oh, no.

1356
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Not happened.

1357
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Yes.

1358
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
V-tode.

1359
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I didn't really feel like doing the pink either.

1360
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So guess what I did.

1361
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The pink.

1362
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Ah.

1363
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Actually, I didn't do the pink.

1364
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
But it's in the works, though.

1365
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Nonetheless, they're on the way.

1366
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Great.

1367
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
On the way.

1368
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You know what?

1369
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
This is decentralized command folks.

1370
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I'm not micromanage in echo.

1371
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Please get the creative brain.

1372
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So like, they're running over that.

1373
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And humility because just because it's not your specific opinion.

1374
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Yeah.

1375
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
But there is a standard of.

1376
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Yeah.

1377
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
So hopefully you maintain it.

1378
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I guess I'll just be, you know.

1379
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I'll try and give you the proper guidance.

1380
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
All right.

1381
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Well, there you go.

1382
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000
To make that happen.

1383
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You know, I'll just go store.com.

1384
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
That's it.

1385
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
That's where they all are.

1386
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And thanks everyone for shopping and supporting.

1387
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
It's awesome.

1388
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
And should we go to the question?

1389
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Oh, wait.

1390
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
One more thing.

1391
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Just a little technical thing.

1392
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Okay.

1393
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Outside.

1394
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Okay.

1395
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Outside of the US.

1396
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Beware outside of US.

1397
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Can't I start anywhere outside of the US?

1398
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I put a little thing on there because just as far as just the shipping process,

1399
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.000
technical thing,

1400
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
for customs.

1401
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.000
They want your phone number to create the shipping label.

1402
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
I need your phone number.

1403
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Oh, I'm not going to give the phone number out.

1404
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I'm not going to call no one text, no nobody.

1405
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But they just need it for the customs thing.

1406
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Got it.

1407
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
So I've tried to put a thing on there,

1408
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
but hey, look, you're shopping.

1409
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
You just want to check out and be done with it.

1410
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I understand.

1411
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000
But if possible, try to check and remember that one.

1412
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Otherwise, you got to email him.

1413
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Oh, it's no problem.

1414
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I'll email for for good.

1415
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
We want this stuff.

1416
01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Yeah.

1417
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Especially it's got a cheap, cheap, a long way.

1418
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Exactly right.

1419
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
In the clear in Holland.

1420
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Yeah.

1421
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000
It's so there's so many people.

1422
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.000
This was really cool.

1423
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
He's getting feedback from people all over.

1424
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000
All over the world.

1425
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
That's crazy, right?

1426
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Yep.

1427
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That's kind of crazy, right?

1428
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
It's all over the world.

1429
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Troopers getting after it.

1430
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Yeah.

1431
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
It makes sense when you keep it.

1432
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
People come in from Sweden.

1433
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Yep.

1434
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Was it came in?

1435
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Yeah.

1436
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Came to the gym.

1437
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Didn't roll though.

1438
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
But we hung out.

1439
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
We talked about physics.

1440
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Properties of physics.

1441
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Yeah.

1442
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Yeah.

1443
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Physics is just...

1444
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Physics is just...

1445
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Guess what?

1446
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
He likes to listen to the podcast.

1447
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
We don't talk about physics.

1448
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Okay.

1449
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Yeah.

1450
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
You don't go in directly.

1451
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yeah.

1452
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000
If you can.

1453
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Outside of the US, try to remember the phone number.

1454
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
So it just...

1455
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It's a step.

1456
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
And it's on its way to you quicker.

1457
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
There it goes.

1458
01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I don't mind emailing them.

1459
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
In fact, I get a lot of cool little conversation.

1460
01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Like the Australia guys for some reason.

1461
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
I love those guys.

1462
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I'm like, hey, and they'll say the Australian stuff.

1463
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
I was in Australia.

1464
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
You know, a couple years ago, whatever.

1465
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And Medescaj Jason.

1466
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
He's a black belt under Hicks-in.

1467
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
And he has it anyway.

1468
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I was with him doing some stuff.

1469
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And he would teach me all the Australian stuff.

1470
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
And some I didn't know.

1471
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Like, too easy, for example.

1472
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Too easy is like...

1473
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
Yeah, I got this.

1474
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Yeah, like all good.

1475
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Yeah, it's just this real...

1476
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
It's kind of ambiguous, but it, you know,

1477
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I love that phrase.

1478
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Anyway, nonetheless, you know, you get into fun conversations with people

1479
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:28.000
when you email them for...

1480
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000
For the simple stuff.

1481
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
For the short order.

1482
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:30.000
For the short order.

1483
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1484
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Whatever, good.

1485
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Good.

1486
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
How long would it...

1487
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.000
How long would it...

1488
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.000
How long would it that go?

1489
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Yeah, roughly two hours.

1490
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Roughly two hours.

1491
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Roughly.

1492
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
All right.

1493
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Well, I actually got a pretty good stack of questions.

1494
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000
I'm thinking that for today, we wrap it.

1495
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
And hold off on Q&A.

1496
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Until the next one.

1497
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
We'll just do all Q&A.

1498
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000
On the next one.

1499
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I don't...

1500
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I don't...

1501
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I don't...

1502
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I don't...

1503
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I don't...

1504
01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I don't...

1505
01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I don't...

1506
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I don't...

1507
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:01.000
I don't...

1508
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
I don't...

1509
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I don't...

1510
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I don't...

1511
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I don't...

1512
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I don't...

1513
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
If you would be quite frank with you, to kinda tough to...

1514
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
even follow up on with this...

1515
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
book.

1516
01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
So...

1517
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
So with that,

1518
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.24
thanks everybody

1519
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
out there for...

1520
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
for listening…

1521
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
for supporting the podcast.

1522
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Thanks for taking the time…

1523
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:31.000
to learn with me…

1524
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
to remember

1525
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
and this tears re-sören.

1526
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
with me to remember with us,

1527
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:50.000
the depth of the world, the depth of the darkness,

1528
01:52:50.000 --> 01:53:03.000
and the sacrifices that have been made for us.

1529
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And remember that.

1530
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Remember that. Remember these men, and what they were really truly afraid of,

1531
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000
not afraid of physical agony, not afraid of death itself,

1532
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
but they feared losing their future.

1533
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
They feared losing their future.

1534
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:59.000
So we here, sitting here today, we have a future, we have that opportunity.

1535
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:12.000
So make sure you take every possible advantage of the opportunity that you have,

1536
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:17.000
and that you have in the future.

1537
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:25.000
And you know how to do that.

1538
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:33.000
You do that by getting out there and getting after it.

1539
01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And so until next time, this is echo and jockel.

1540
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Out.
