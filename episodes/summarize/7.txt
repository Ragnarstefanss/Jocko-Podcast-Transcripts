We'd be like, all right, we're going to get to bench 300 once we were benching 300, we'd say, all right, we're going to go and we'd be doing things like, hey, we're going to do the six mile run and extra time that we get that we'd say, oh, we're going to do 50 pull ups If you're a graduate, if you're a pro, if you're like, you know, I'm going to allow excuses to get in my head or kind of kind of pussy foot around and be like, well, you know, moderation is all right kind of thing and have that attitude. You know, it's one thing to have do a podcast with a guy like Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan or Sam Harris where you've got this, you know, famous individual and of course people want to listen to them, but who's going to want to listen to Jocco and Echo? And for me, it actually brings back my memories of when I first got to the seal teams, because when I first got to the seal teams, it was actually pretty hard to find a good mentor that I looked at and said, you know, I want to be like that person, and they were going to invest in you. and you know, he's going to, I don't know, dunk and don't know, something for you know, there it is. And the same way, if you don't allow your troopers to make mistakes like you said and try new things and you don't encourage that, then they're going to be, their morale is going to be crushed and they're not going to make the progress that they need to do need to make. And once I realized that, it was always easy for me to do that from then on, and not only that, but it became easy for me to do that in regular life, and other things that I'm doing, and having conversations and dealing with relationships and making sure I'm not getting dragged down into these crazy relationships situations, or business situations, where there's a lot of emotion going on and saying, you know what, I'm just going to step back and observe this from a better vantage point that's more unbiased. You can take, you know, take us to take in a way, take pride in the fact that it's nope, I'm not even going to go that's nope, I'm not drink, I'm not going out to the club drinking, I got a rest, I got to work out in the morning or whatever. Or from like an expanded point of view, like the big picture where if someone's not raised, I kind of mentioned this before as well, where if someone is raised in a really rigid household where, you know, the, the kid who's taking piano lessons, he makes one wrong key and he gets whacked with a ruler, right? So that if an surgeon is going to attack us, they're going to look at us and say, you know what, let's wait till a little less aggressive convoy came through. And he explained to me in a very solemn way that the movie depicted these Americans going in, and, you know, brutalizing these villages and, you know, doing horrible things to these villagers. They've got to clean everything, they've got to go to think dialed in, and then the guy shows up for five minutes, and it took, you know, four hours to get everything ready, the guy shows up for five minutes, who asks the quarks mile, and then leaves. But, you know, so the, so the higher belt generally shouldn't be like putting someone in a submission and hurting them because experience guys and GJ2, they know when the tension is there on the arm or the foot or the knee. Because people are asking, you know, hey, you should do a podcast, but there's, you know, okay, well, where's it going to go? You know, the conventional war is a fast war where you know what's going to happen. Something we talk about all the time on this podcast is having the ability to adapt and be flexible and you know, whether it's working out in a hotel room, whether it's, you know, finding something good to eat or not eating because there is nothing good to eat. You don't see that that not only yeah, you're going to have to spend so much effort just to get that little gains, which no one's going to be able to tell unless you're going to competition. And, you know, whatever it's going to be a certain number of, you know, a 20 reps squat routine at a certain weight. And I realized right then, you know, like, wow, I can, I can kind of, I think I got this. We're going to be everyone's going to have a gun pointed at the, you know, at a target somewhere, wherever you think would be a target. You don't want to, if you know I'm going to do an arm bar, I'm not going to get the arm bar. If I'm feeling horrible and you know, you can see occasionally my workouts is consistent like, you know, doing some mobility training rolling it out.
