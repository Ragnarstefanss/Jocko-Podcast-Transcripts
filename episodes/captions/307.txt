00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jockel Podcast number 307 with Echo Charles and me.
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:05.64 Jockel willing Good evening Echo.
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:06.64 Good evening.
00:00:06.64 --> 00:00:08.40 Also joining us again tonight is Dave Burke.
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.40 Good evening Dave.
00:00:09.40 --> 00:00:10.40 Good evening.
00:00:10.40 --> 00:00:14.92 I gave everyone fair warning that this book was going to take a while.
00:00:14.92 --> 00:00:19.92 We are going to continue the review of on the psychology of military incompetence which we
00:00:19.92 --> 00:00:26.12 started on podcast 303 304 305 306.
00:00:26.12 --> 00:00:27.12 Now we're on 307.
00:00:27.12 --> 00:00:30.44 You haven't listened to those go back and do so.
00:00:30.44 --> 00:00:34.44 If you listen to those, you probably realized that which I realized I haven't pointed
00:00:34.44 --> 00:00:35.44 out yet.
00:00:35.44 --> 00:00:40.16 I hope it's obvious even though the context of these books is military.
00:00:40.16 --> 00:00:41.84 It doesn't just apply to the military.
00:00:41.84 --> 00:00:48.92 It applies to everyone in every leadership situation which is why we can learn so much
00:00:48.92 --> 00:00:51.12 from these insights with that.
00:00:51.12 --> 00:00:52.12 Let's get.
00:00:52.12 --> 00:00:54.44 Well, let's get back to the book.
00:00:54.44 --> 00:00:55.44 Yes.
00:00:55.44 --> 00:01:02.80 Let's say on the psychology of military incompetence by Dr. Norman F. Dixon also World War
00:01:02.80 --> 00:01:06.72 II that wounded in action legit guy.
00:01:06.72 --> 00:01:12.56 Little bit too crazy on the psychology stuff sometimes, especially nowadays.
00:01:12.56 --> 00:01:15.72 The psychology of some of the psychology of Freud's been debunked.
00:01:15.72 --> 00:01:17.84 Freud was a cocaine addict.
00:01:17.84 --> 00:01:25.36 Freud was what's it prescribed in cocaine for like every problem that you had.
00:01:25.36 --> 00:01:27.36 You said, oh, I'm not feeling really cocaine.
00:01:27.36 --> 00:01:30.28 Oh, you know, I'm sick to my stomach cocaine.
00:01:30.28 --> 00:01:31.96 I'm not getting along with my wife cocaine.
00:01:31.96 --> 00:01:35.04 This guy was doing cocaine and prescribing cocaine.
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:38.44 And apparently he lied about a bunch of stuff too.
00:01:38.44 --> 00:01:42.36 He would say that he cured people that never got cured or he would say that they were
00:01:42.36 --> 00:01:46.88 cured but they were really just cocaine addicts.
00:01:46.88 --> 00:01:49.36 So there is some stuff.
00:01:49.36 --> 00:01:58.04 And I don't know, the I never was a big psychology guy until we had Jordan Peterson
00:01:58.04 --> 00:01:59.04 on this podcast.
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:01.92 That was kind of the first time I said, oh, I get it.
00:02:01.92 --> 00:02:06.16 That's where I realized these guys are brain mechanics that understand there's a problem.
00:02:06.16 --> 00:02:07.16 They look at it.
00:02:07.16 --> 00:02:08.56 They go, yep, we've seen this before.
00:02:08.56 --> 00:02:09.88 Yep, I know this pattern.
00:02:09.88 --> 00:02:14.72 Oh, you're scared of this thing or you don't get along with these types of people or whatever.
00:02:14.72 --> 00:02:16.44 They say, yep, we've seen that before.
00:02:16.44 --> 00:02:18.64 Here's how we can actually fix it.
00:02:18.64 --> 00:02:27.24 I prior to that thought psychology was what's the right word kind of, you know,
00:02:27.24 --> 00:02:28.24 gobbledy-gook.
00:02:28.24 --> 00:02:29.24 Is that the right word?
00:02:29.24 --> 00:02:30.24 What would you just say?
00:02:30.24 --> 00:02:31.24 We'll we'll.
00:02:31.24 --> 00:02:35.16 Yeah, a little bit of woo-woo stuff, a little bit like, hey, how could these guys?
00:02:35.16 --> 00:02:37.24 What are they going to do with spring, your ear?
00:02:37.24 --> 00:02:38.48 You know, I thought it was that kind of thing.
00:02:38.48 --> 00:02:41.72 I didn't realize that they had methodologies and that they made sense.
00:02:41.72 --> 00:02:43.44 What about hypnosis or whatever?
00:02:43.44 --> 00:02:46.16 I don't really understand hypnosis too much.
00:02:46.16 --> 00:02:47.84 I've never been hypnotized.
00:02:47.84 --> 00:02:51.12 I've never even been to one of those shows where people get hypnotized and they act like
00:02:51.12 --> 00:02:52.12 a monkey or whatever.
00:02:52.12 --> 00:02:53.12 Have you been to one of those?
00:02:53.12 --> 00:02:54.12 Yeah.
00:02:54.12 --> 00:02:55.12 You believe it?
00:02:55.12 --> 00:02:57.64 I believe that hypnosis can work on some people.
00:02:57.64 --> 00:02:59.36 In fact, I think that's the chance.
00:02:59.36 --> 00:03:04.60 Yeah, yeah, but the show that I went to, I went to two of them that I remember.
00:03:04.60 --> 00:03:11.88 And I remember thinking this hypnitist isn't that good, either not that good or the
00:03:11.88 --> 00:03:15.16 person, the subject or whatever was just sort of going along.
00:03:15.16 --> 00:03:17.32 Not because they're re-in on some scam.
00:03:17.32 --> 00:03:18.32 But more, there's down for the call.
00:03:18.32 --> 00:03:19.96 Down for the call, exactly right.
00:03:19.96 --> 00:03:21.96 They didn't want to make everything lit down and stuff.
00:03:21.96 --> 00:03:22.96 So they just did it.
00:03:22.96 --> 00:03:23.96 Have you ever seen anywhere you'd hypnotized?
00:03:23.96 --> 00:03:24.96 No.
00:03:24.96 --> 00:03:25.96 Have you ever been hypnotized?
00:03:25.96 --> 00:03:26.96 No.
00:03:26.96 --> 00:03:28.96 Well, there's little tests they can do.
00:03:28.96 --> 00:03:29.96 They let that.
00:03:29.96 --> 00:03:30.96 I saw them in Rogan.
00:03:30.96 --> 00:03:31.96 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:31.96 --> 00:03:33.96 I saw that from a role in your eyes back or something.
00:03:33.96 --> 00:03:34.96 Like, who's that guy?
00:03:34.96 --> 00:03:37.16 I don't know if you're good.
00:03:37.16 --> 00:03:40.96 So that's kind of, you know how you kind of looked at it.
00:03:40.96 --> 00:03:42.68 Not really, 100% sure.
00:03:42.68 --> 00:03:44.84 That's kind of how I looked at psychology before.
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:49.72 Or Jordan came on and I understood.
00:03:49.72 --> 00:03:54.48 And what was weird was how he was explaining exposure therapy, which is exactly what's
00:03:54.48 --> 00:03:55.76 in way the word kidnised.
00:03:55.76 --> 00:03:57.28 Oh, this stuff can make sense.
00:03:57.28 --> 00:03:58.28 Got it.
00:03:58.28 --> 00:03:59.48 But of course there's some weird stuff.
00:03:59.48 --> 00:04:01.24 They're still weird stuff in psychology.
00:04:01.24 --> 00:04:05.20 And they're doing weird stuff right now in the psychological world.
00:04:05.20 --> 00:04:07.60 The way they're coming out with all kinds of weird things.
00:04:07.60 --> 00:04:11.60 So did you study psychology or did you take any psych...
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:13.04 I'm sure I took something.
00:04:13.04 --> 00:04:14.60 Actually, I'm not sure I did.
00:04:14.60 --> 00:04:18.80 But I don't remember if I did, I don't remember it other than maybe whatever you learned
00:04:18.80 --> 00:04:20.52 in high school.
00:04:20.52 --> 00:04:22.16 Maybe that's what maybe think it was.
00:04:22.16 --> 00:04:24.16 That's the term you used.
00:04:24.16 --> 00:04:25.96 And what did I say?
00:04:25.96 --> 00:04:26.96 Gobble, the Gobble.
00:04:26.96 --> 00:04:27.96 The Cube.
00:04:27.96 --> 00:04:28.96 Some advice.
00:04:28.96 --> 00:04:31.84 So the psychologist out there, I apologize.
00:04:31.84 --> 00:04:34.44 It's not Gobble the Gook and it's not Woo Woo.
00:04:34.44 --> 00:04:35.44 It's legit.
00:04:35.44 --> 00:04:37.36 It's mind mechanics.
00:04:37.36 --> 00:04:40.16 Well, okay, you ever heard of Pavlov's dog?
00:04:40.16 --> 00:04:41.16 Yes.
00:04:41.16 --> 00:04:42.16 Okay, so just that alone.
00:04:42.16 --> 00:04:43.16 So that's legit.
00:04:43.16 --> 00:04:44.72 Yeah, just that on think about it.
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:51.32 Frickin' you just associate a bell with food and it's your body response.
00:04:51.32 --> 00:04:52.32 You're being hit.
00:04:52.32 --> 00:04:54.68 Stuff that you don't control just responds in that way.
00:04:54.68 --> 00:04:58.12 It's like, okay, so you just think about how deep that goes.
00:04:58.12 --> 00:05:02.52 And then people who understand that and can navigate and guide and influence in that way.
00:05:02.52 --> 00:05:03.52 Yep.
00:05:03.52 --> 00:05:04.52 Yeah, that makes sense.
00:05:04.52 --> 00:05:05.96 And so here's the deal.
00:05:05.96 --> 00:05:13.12 On this book, I didn't want to just start trying to play psychological historian.
00:05:13.12 --> 00:05:14.12 Right.
00:05:14.12 --> 00:05:15.12 And go back.
00:05:15.12 --> 00:05:16.12 But there's definitely some things I read.
00:05:16.12 --> 00:05:18.12 I was like, okay, bro.
00:05:18.12 --> 00:05:26.72 Hey, Dr. Nixon, I respect you, but I'm not going to, it's too much, right?
00:05:26.72 --> 00:05:27.72 It's too much.
00:05:27.72 --> 00:05:30.56 A lot of that Freudian stuff is too much.
00:05:30.56 --> 00:05:31.56 Weird.
00:05:31.56 --> 00:05:32.56 Not just weird.
00:05:32.56 --> 00:05:33.56 It's not that it's just weird.
00:05:33.56 --> 00:05:36.16 If it's weird, but it makes, but it's backed up.
00:05:36.16 --> 00:05:37.16 Cool.
00:05:37.16 --> 00:05:38.96 There's weird stuff going on in your head.
00:05:38.96 --> 00:05:41.64 But when you read something, you go, that seems kind of weird.
00:05:41.64 --> 00:05:44.52 Then you find out that it's all deepunked anyways.
00:05:44.52 --> 00:05:46.36 And that was the deal with Freud.
00:05:46.36 --> 00:05:51.36 Freud, like I said, on the last podcast, a broken clock is right twice a day.
00:05:51.36 --> 00:05:52.96 Well, that's the same thing with Freud.
00:05:52.96 --> 00:05:54.20 He was right about some stuff.
00:05:54.20 --> 00:06:00.44 The biggest thing being that you do have underlying psychological thoughts, subliminal
00:06:00.44 --> 00:06:02.80 thoughts, your subconscious thoughts, not subliminal.
00:06:02.80 --> 00:06:07.88 Subconscious thoughts that would drive your decision making it, make you act a certain way.
00:06:07.88 --> 00:06:12.84 So if you got whatever your parents treated you a certain way, you're going to tend
00:06:12.84 --> 00:06:18.76 to wave, if your parents built distrust in you, you might not trust people as much.
00:06:18.76 --> 00:06:22.28 If they wanted you to win all the time, you might, and that could go two ways, right?
00:06:22.28 --> 00:06:25.28 You could be like, oh, I'm going to win or I don't give a shit.
00:06:25.28 --> 00:06:26.28 Yeah.
00:06:26.28 --> 00:06:27.28 Right?
00:06:27.28 --> 00:06:28.40 So it's weird how you're going to turn out.
00:06:28.40 --> 00:06:32.08 But what is, you can't predict how the person's going to turn out.
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:37.36 But you can say it has to do with the fact that every time little Johnny did get win
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:40.52 in first place, his dad was beating him.
00:06:40.52 --> 00:06:44.40 He either grows up in his winning or he just doesn't care about competing.
00:06:44.40 --> 00:06:45.40 Right.
00:06:45.40 --> 00:06:46.40 It's not even competing.
00:06:46.40 --> 00:06:49.04 But those are underline costs.
00:06:49.04 --> 00:06:54.28 Now what Freud did was he brought it all down to like how you were potty trained.
00:06:54.28 --> 00:06:59.52 And just, no, it's not just that.
00:06:59.52 --> 00:07:06.08 So that being said, there are underlying things and this guy ends up profiling all these
00:07:06.08 --> 00:07:07.08 different people.
00:07:07.08 --> 00:07:08.08 So here we go.
00:07:08.08 --> 00:07:09.36 We're going to get into this.
00:07:09.36 --> 00:07:12.72 This section is called character and honor kind of going.
00:07:12.72 --> 00:07:14.92 It opens up with a great quote.
00:07:14.92 --> 00:07:20.04 Why should a man be in love with his fenders, though of gold?
00:07:20.04 --> 00:07:22.68 So you are chained.
00:07:22.68 --> 00:07:25.000 And you're in love with those chains.
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000 But you shouldn't be.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.32 Even if they're made of gold, you shouldn't be in love with them.
00:07:28.32 --> 00:07:32.80 And another one moderation in war is in facility.
00:07:32.80 --> 00:07:34.60 Interesting.
00:07:34.60 --> 00:07:41.34 Going to the book here in the context of militarism, the forces of conscious and of
00:07:41.34 --> 00:07:46.32 character manifest themselves in various guises, in medieval notions of shivari, in codes
00:07:46.32 --> 00:07:53.08 of honor such as the duel and in the belief that officers must of necessity be gentlemen.
00:07:53.08 --> 00:07:57.84 As Carl DeMet Tomato showed, has shown in his history of the German officer corps, these
00:07:57.84 --> 00:08:04.22 notions of honor and shivari brought about and wore themselves reinforced by a care to
00:08:04.22 --> 00:08:09.66 select officer material from the aristocracy and rural landowners.
00:08:09.66 --> 00:08:16.38 A state of affairs reflected in the contrast of snobbiness, exclusiveness, sense of honor and
00:08:16.38 --> 00:08:22.26 lack of intellectual ability, which obtained between the officer corps, corps drawn from
00:08:22.26 --> 00:08:28.14 the aristocratic junk or families of the great-per-state of Russia and those more
00:08:28.14 --> 00:08:33.10 bourgeois elements from the industrialized southwest of Germany.
00:08:33.10 --> 00:08:39.42 So these old military officers came from rich folk.
00:08:39.42 --> 00:08:42.30 And these are there's a difference between some of the rich folk that were in the city and
00:08:42.30 --> 00:08:45.74 some of the rich folk that were big landowners and they had a little bit different behavior.
00:08:45.74 --> 00:08:48.10 Not going to spend too much time on that, but I'm going to fast forward a little bit.
00:08:48.10 --> 00:08:51.54 A code of honor is a set of rules for behavior.
00:08:51.54 --> 00:08:58.18 The rules are observed because to break them provokes the distressing emotions of guilt
00:08:58.18 --> 00:09:02.66 or shame, whereas guilt is a product of knowing that one is transgressed and therefore
00:09:02.66 --> 00:09:07.94 might be found out, shame results from actually being found out in military circles traditionally
00:09:07.94 --> 00:09:10.38 the greater crime.
00:09:10.38 --> 00:09:17.38 It is usually assumed that military codes of honor serve to reduce fear.
00:09:17.38 --> 00:09:18.74 This may well be so.
00:09:18.74 --> 00:09:25.70 Their primary object, however, is to combat not so much fear as the sort of behavior to which
00:09:25.70 --> 00:09:28.74 fear might otherwise give rise.
00:09:28.74 --> 00:09:34.02 In other words, they are designed to ensure that threatening situations are met by fight
00:09:34.02 --> 00:09:36.82 rather than flight.
00:09:36.82 --> 00:09:40.26 They do this by making the social consequences of flight.
00:09:40.26 --> 00:09:45.14 The social consequences of flight rather more unpleasant than the physical consequences
00:09:45.14 --> 00:09:46.14 of flight.
00:09:46.14 --> 00:09:47.82 That's freaking radical, right?
00:09:47.82 --> 00:09:51.06 Like I would rat and you hear a team guy say this all the time, but I'd rather just
00:09:51.06 --> 00:09:55.30 freaking die than be a scissor.
00:09:55.30 --> 00:10:02.10 100% I've heard of that, it was better fact, BTF Tony said that on this podcast, he's
00:10:02.10 --> 00:10:09.82 scared shitless of heights and he's on some 80 story building in Hong Kong or Singapore or
00:10:09.82 --> 00:10:13.34 something, he's got to repel off of it and he's totally thinking he's going to die.
00:10:13.34 --> 00:10:18.78 He's like, well, I would rather die than be a scissor up here.
00:10:18.78 --> 00:10:25.78 So they're rules work, whereas the latter might lead to physical pain, mutilation, and
00:10:25.78 --> 00:10:30.86 death, the former, ofventuates with far greater certainty in personal guilt and public
00:10:30.86 --> 00:10:35.54 shame.
00:10:35.54 --> 00:10:40.06 What I'm thinking about this is I'm saying to her, think like, who fought?
00:10:40.06 --> 00:10:42.78 Who said it to what you know what we need to do is we need to create a code of honors
00:10:42.78 --> 00:10:44.74 that we can make sure that people don't run away.
00:10:44.74 --> 00:10:53.22 That would be some really meticulous, like, preemptive ideas.
00:10:53.22 --> 00:10:57.22 I'm thinking that there's a tribal nature to this stuff.
00:10:57.22 --> 00:11:05.66 We are instinctively programmed that if you run, you're not looking out for your clan and
00:11:05.66 --> 00:11:07.70 you suck and we don't like you.
00:11:07.70 --> 00:11:13.30 I think that's, I think there's an instinct to that, not just a code that's written by
00:11:13.30 --> 00:11:21.58 modern man, but I think there's like a code that's instilled in us by being an animal.
00:11:21.58 --> 00:11:22.58 Yeah.
00:11:22.58 --> 00:11:25.06 That seems like the case for sure.
00:11:25.06 --> 00:11:29.50 Maybe the code is just to like take that in an extreme situation.
00:11:29.50 --> 00:11:30.50 Correct.
00:11:30.50 --> 00:11:32.22 And animals have it too.
00:11:32.22 --> 00:11:35.70 Like a pack of hyenas go after a lion or whatever.
00:11:35.70 --> 00:11:38.86 They go after animals that can definitely kill a couple of them.
00:11:38.86 --> 00:11:43.50 But they'd rather be the one that gets killed than be the one that runs away.
00:11:43.50 --> 00:11:46.42 And they know that if they can't run away, they're not going to survive as a species.
00:11:46.42 --> 00:11:48.42 So they got to get it on.
00:11:48.42 --> 00:11:52.18 Man, I watched some hyenas the other day.
00:11:52.18 --> 00:11:53.18 Discover each animal?
00:11:53.18 --> 00:11:55.94 No, like YouTube, freaking red zone.
00:11:55.94 --> 00:11:59.42 Like, hey, I'm nine videos deeper, whatever.
00:11:59.42 --> 00:12:03.18 But dude, this zebra was getting to eat and by hyenas.
00:12:03.18 --> 00:12:05.54 And first of all, hyenas were savage.
00:12:05.54 --> 00:12:09.78 Hyenas are my favorite land animal, by the way.
00:12:09.78 --> 00:12:11.74 But the zebra was stoic.
00:12:11.74 --> 00:12:13.86 He was having his legs eaten.
00:12:13.86 --> 00:12:17.62 And he looked, the look on his face was he was watching it after new movie.
00:12:17.62 --> 00:12:20.10 Yeah, I've seen that too.
00:12:20.10 --> 00:12:25.38 I wonder if there's like a thing that triggers on a prey animal that like, because you
00:12:25.38 --> 00:12:26.38 see that a lot.
00:12:26.38 --> 00:12:31.02 It's not like you don't see water, no, if I've ever seen any zebra, sinned or prey animal,
00:12:31.02 --> 00:12:32.38 like screaming and stuff.
00:12:32.38 --> 00:12:33.38 Oh, no, I have.
00:12:33.38 --> 00:12:34.38 You have.
00:12:34.38 --> 00:12:36.82 I always see the deer just sort of stoic.
00:12:36.82 --> 00:12:40.86 Oh, no, there's there's ones where those things are just screaming and not handling
00:12:40.86 --> 00:12:41.86 it.
00:12:41.86 --> 00:12:44.70 Yeah, I think there's stoic zebra and there's an unscheduled zebra.
00:12:44.70 --> 00:12:45.90 That's what I think.
00:12:45.90 --> 00:12:47.06 Cool.
00:12:47.06 --> 00:12:51.82 He's got a little indent here, little section.
00:12:51.82 --> 00:12:55.06 When a soldier in action sees his life in immediate danger, even the bravest will
00:12:55.06 --> 00:12:59.46 we seize to buy a moment of fear, biologically speaking, fear is a natural reflexensation
00:12:59.46 --> 00:13:05.34 of the instinct of self preservation, which dwells within every man, heroes included.
00:13:05.34 --> 00:13:10.38 Again, what's a little bit interesting about that is like Dean Ladd being on this podcast,
00:13:10.38 --> 00:13:14.26 going to Taroa and a head dean, were you scared?
00:13:14.26 --> 00:13:17.70 He's like, no, but it was going to happen to someone else.
00:13:17.70 --> 00:13:21.10 So maybe even the high-enus think it's going to happen to someone else.
00:13:21.10 --> 00:13:22.98 That Paul ain't going to hit me.
00:13:22.98 --> 00:13:28.14 We're not going to catch a freaking K-9 tooth to the jugular on this one.
00:13:28.14 --> 00:13:33.02 The victories to be one, the elementary physical sensation must somehow be artificially
00:13:33.02 --> 00:13:39.18 suppressed, over-compensated by a contrary reflex of the psychic and moral kind, converted
00:13:39.18 --> 00:13:40.58 into action.
00:13:40.58 --> 00:13:45.18 Bro, I'm a little bit in disagreement here, because I've seen guys that you just like,
00:13:45.18 --> 00:13:46.46 well, this guy doesn't care.
00:13:46.46 --> 00:13:49.54 He doesn't think he can die.
00:13:49.54 --> 00:13:55.70 Whatever, walking across the street, running across the street, totally going against,
00:13:55.70 --> 00:14:01.62 I don't think there's enough time to think, I want to go drag that guy out of the street,
00:14:01.62 --> 00:14:05.42 but it looks really dangerous, but I want to prove myself.
00:14:05.42 --> 00:14:09.02 No, they're like, hey, I'm going to go get that guy, because he's her, what do you think,
00:14:09.02 --> 00:14:10.02 Dave?
00:14:10.02 --> 00:14:15.94 Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking about all this, like, even the need to write this stuff down,
00:14:15.94 --> 00:14:20.06 all this stuff pragmatically makes sense, but I deserve people do things in environments
00:14:20.06 --> 00:14:23.18 that sort of defy some of the things that are being said.
00:14:23.18 --> 00:14:26.54 So in a bare minimum, there's definitely exceptions to this idea that all men have this
00:14:26.54 --> 00:14:27.74 thing.
00:14:27.74 --> 00:14:32.34 And if they don't all have it, some of them go through whatever that process is in light
00:14:32.34 --> 00:14:37.14 speed, if it's still happening, and I can't see it, it's happening so quickly that
00:14:37.14 --> 00:14:39.38 they're just on doing things.
00:14:39.38 --> 00:14:47.14 I have seen people do things that are dumb and be like, hey, bro, you need to get, put
00:14:47.14 --> 00:14:48.14 your head down.
00:14:48.14 --> 00:14:54.14 From a basic self preservation, like, sniper fires a good example, we would take sniper
00:14:54.14 --> 00:14:56.06 fire pretty regularly.
00:14:56.06 --> 00:15:00.34 And I've seen guys get so frustrated and so fed up, and I saw a platoon commander once
00:15:00.34 --> 00:15:05.90 behaved just incorrectly walking around on the roof to have like, no, this isn't moving
00:15:05.90 --> 00:15:07.06 past the fear.
00:15:07.06 --> 00:15:09.18 This is some other disconnect there.
00:15:09.18 --> 00:15:11.94 I know that's not exactly what you're talking about, but I've seen people behave like
00:15:11.94 --> 00:15:12.94 that.
00:15:12.94 --> 00:15:17.02 Oh, no, I was on a rooftop one time, and we started taking fire and there were some army
00:15:17.02 --> 00:15:22.70 dudes I was up there with a couple army dudes, and we started taking a little bit of fire,
00:15:22.70 --> 00:15:26.70 and it was, you know, chinching, whatever, and I'm just standing there, and the guys kind
00:15:26.70 --> 00:15:31.46 of got down, and I was just being, you know, Mr. Bath, Mr. Bath, that's right.
00:15:31.46 --> 00:15:36.14 Hey, whatever, no factor on Colonel Kilgore, and then all of a sudden like another like
00:15:36.14 --> 00:15:38.02 three rounds of ripped really closer.
00:15:38.02 --> 00:15:40.02 Yeah, I had the decks.
00:15:40.02 --> 00:15:42.02 I had the deck.
00:15:42.02 --> 00:15:44.02 I wasn't so cool anymore.
00:15:44.02 --> 00:15:48.66 So my self-preservation was kind of kicked in.
00:15:48.66 --> 00:15:50.66 Those ones are close.
00:15:50.66 --> 00:15:51.66 Yes.
00:15:51.66 --> 00:15:53.66 You threshold those kind of more further down.
00:15:53.66 --> 00:15:54.66 And that's different.
00:15:54.66 --> 00:15:55.66 You got it.
00:15:55.66 --> 00:15:58.42 There's a threshold, and you see people have different thresholds, and some maybe the threshold
00:15:58.42 --> 00:16:03.54 either doesn't exist or it's so narrow, there's no real gap there that you can observe.
00:16:03.54 --> 00:16:06.82 But to say the way he said it, I agree with you, like there's, I've seen people do
00:16:06.82 --> 00:16:08.30 things like that, that's not what I've seen.
00:16:08.30 --> 00:16:10.94 No, it's not done happen all the time, but you see it.
00:16:10.94 --> 00:16:13.94 I'm not sure.
00:16:13.94 --> 00:16:18.70 Next to the negative content of this counter reflex is the feeling of shame.
00:16:18.70 --> 00:16:24.30 If it says, you don't stand fast now, but run away, the others will laugh at you and
00:16:24.30 --> 00:16:25.30 despise you.
00:16:25.30 --> 00:16:30.30 Again, that's a lot of thought to be having in the moment of truth.
00:16:30.30 --> 00:16:34.54 That's a lot of, I mean, I've done some stuff that was dumb or what I would.
00:16:34.54 --> 00:16:37.70 I've done some stuff where it's like, hmm, hey, should I be doing this right now?
00:16:37.70 --> 00:16:39.30 Maybe not, but I don't even think about that.
00:16:39.30 --> 00:16:41.30 I wasn't thinking, oh, I don't want to look bad.
00:16:41.30 --> 00:16:48.66 I was like, hey, there go whatever crosses the tree, go to go this, whatever.
00:16:48.66 --> 00:16:51.98 Assold your must therefore be provided unless nature has done.
00:16:51.98 --> 00:16:53.58 You know, it's another good example, it's Mike Thornton.
00:16:53.58 --> 00:16:57.98 I was, you know, Mike Thornton's just huckin' ingrenade fights with people.
00:16:57.98 --> 00:16:59.54 He shot people shot.
00:16:59.54 --> 00:17:02.18 There's people all around him.
00:17:02.18 --> 00:17:04.98 And I asked him when he was on the podcast, like, oh, we know what you think and you
00:17:04.98 --> 00:17:05.98 might get shot.
00:17:05.98 --> 00:17:07.98 And he's like, no, no, he's just, no, I never thought about that.
00:17:07.98 --> 00:17:09.66 It's gonna say my friend.
00:17:09.66 --> 00:17:10.66 Next question.
00:17:10.66 --> 00:17:13.54 He was almost embarrassed that I asked that question.
00:17:13.54 --> 00:17:15.30 He was like, dude, what is wrong with you?
00:17:15.30 --> 00:17:16.30 Ha ha ha.
00:17:16.30 --> 00:17:20.74 A soldier must therefore be provided unless nature has done the job already.
00:17:20.74 --> 00:17:22.46 Oh, so he's got a little caveat.
00:17:22.46 --> 00:17:27.10 So there's a possibility that nature just made you brave with a set of automatic inhibitions
00:17:27.10 --> 00:17:31.98 that will save him in the moment of danger from a collapse of his own morale.
00:17:31.98 --> 00:17:32.98 Discipline, of course.
00:17:32.98 --> 00:17:33.98 Thank you.
00:17:33.98 --> 00:17:36.70 Discipline, of course, can hold him steady from without.
00:17:36.70 --> 00:17:42.22 And his one moral defense against internal weakness is the sense of honor to arouse this
00:17:42.22 --> 00:17:48.42 sense in the ordinary soldier cultivated and above all, inspire it by his own example
00:17:48.42 --> 00:17:53.70 is the officer's highest duty and to fulfill that duty he must himself have a sense of honor
00:17:53.70 --> 00:17:57.34 that is well developed, active and finely tuned.
00:17:57.34 --> 00:17:58.34 Yeah.
00:17:58.34 --> 00:18:03.02 That's a lot of pre-conceived thought.
00:18:03.02 --> 00:18:07.42 Like the Marine Corps, it back in what we coming up on the what anniversary of the Marine
00:18:07.42 --> 00:18:08.42 Corps?
00:18:08.42 --> 00:18:11.22 1775 minus 20.
00:18:11.22 --> 00:18:12.22 Yeah, 100.
00:18:12.22 --> 00:18:13.22 Yeah, 100.
00:18:13.22 --> 00:18:19.06 A couple hundred and a half, whatever, 250 something years of ending the Marine Corps said,
00:18:19.06 --> 00:18:20.06 you know what we need to do.
00:18:20.06 --> 00:18:21.82 We need to create a code of honor.
00:18:21.82 --> 00:18:25.18 So that Marines, they won't run away.
00:18:25.18 --> 00:18:26.66 Like I can't see that app.
00:18:26.66 --> 00:18:27.66 No.
00:18:27.66 --> 00:18:30.46 And I'm just thinking of the basic fundamental training I've been through as an officer
00:18:30.46 --> 00:18:31.46 of the Marine Corps.
00:18:31.46 --> 00:18:32.46 I don't remember any of that.
00:18:32.46 --> 00:18:34.14 I've never been given the code of conduct.
00:18:34.14 --> 00:18:39.78 And there is unquestionably from day one, you don't want to look bad in front of your
00:18:39.78 --> 00:18:40.78 peers.
00:18:40.78 --> 00:18:43.70 I know that feeling of getting to like, officer candidate school in the basic school in
00:18:43.70 --> 00:18:45.34 flight school and like, oh, I don't want to look bad.
00:18:45.34 --> 00:18:47.46 I understand that feeling.
00:18:47.46 --> 00:18:51.86 But there was a lot of words there to describe the situation that almost implies that
00:18:51.86 --> 00:18:56.34 you're going to have some sort of cognitive process to go, let me do a quick cost benefit
00:18:56.34 --> 00:19:00.86 here of running away to save my life or, you know, what my peers will think of me
00:19:00.86 --> 00:19:01.86 down the road.
00:19:01.86 --> 00:19:02.86 Do that.
00:19:02.86 --> 00:19:04.14 I can't connect with that.
00:19:04.14 --> 00:19:07.42 Right, like three months into the basic school, you're like, you know what, if anything
00:19:07.42 --> 00:19:08.86 happens, I'm not going to run.
00:19:08.86 --> 00:19:09.86 Yeah.
00:19:09.86 --> 00:19:11.86 Check.
00:19:11.86 --> 00:19:18.78 To the extent that a code of honor is reflexive in the sense used by a Demeter.
00:19:18.78 --> 00:19:22.74 It is so inflexible thereby leading on occasions to behavior that is so irrational as to
00:19:22.74 --> 00:19:24.02 burr on the absurd.
00:19:24.02 --> 00:19:25.02 That makes sense.
00:19:25.02 --> 00:19:29.06 There are sometimes where people have done stuff that does it make sense.
00:19:29.06 --> 00:19:30.06 It doesn't make sense.
00:19:30.06 --> 00:19:31.06 What they're doing.
00:19:31.06 --> 00:19:32.06 That's not going to be a good way to do it.
00:19:32.06 --> 00:19:33.06 But it doesn't make sense.
00:19:33.06 --> 00:19:37.66 And it's not even good.
00:19:37.66 --> 00:19:41.94 The following example illustrates the juxtaposition of bull and honor.
00:19:41.94 --> 00:19:43.38 The year was 1755.
00:19:43.38 --> 00:19:47.82 General Braddock set out with his two regiments, the 44th and the 48th and 600 irregular
00:19:47.82 --> 00:19:53.06 on a march to fort.
00:19:53.06 --> 00:19:55.30 Deca Seney.
00:19:55.30 --> 00:19:59.98 About nine miles from it, he was ambushed by Indians led by French officers.
00:19:59.98 --> 00:20:01.90 The result was disastrous.
00:20:01.90 --> 00:20:07.90 The men in their scarlet uniforms and white spatter dashes marching in columns where the
00:20:07.90 --> 00:20:11.34 sort of target ambush forces dream of.
00:20:11.34 --> 00:20:15.30 The Amican imaginers here come the literal British red coats.
00:20:15.30 --> 00:20:20.50 Here they come marching in columns and they can ambush by the French and the Indians.
00:20:20.50 --> 00:20:23.42 Helpless because they could not see their enemies.
00:20:23.42 --> 00:20:28.18 Some of the British troops broke for cover and fired from behind trees.
00:20:28.18 --> 00:20:29.18 Okay.
00:20:29.18 --> 00:20:29.94 Cool.
00:20:29.94 --> 00:20:36.42 This appalled Braddock and his officers, they considered scolicking behind trees both
00:20:36.42 --> 00:20:42.98 undisciplined and unsolgedly so they drove the Tommy's back into columns.
00:20:42.98 --> 00:20:46.02 Where, of course, they were butchered.
00:20:46.02 --> 00:20:49.62 The whole episode was glaring proof that neither leaders nor the system under which they
00:20:49.62 --> 00:20:52.50 operated were worthy of the troops they used.
00:20:52.50 --> 00:20:55.14 But that's like crazy, right?
00:20:55.14 --> 00:20:59.18 That's crazy.
00:20:59.18 --> 00:21:01.70 What I'm thinking about was that there's another example.
00:21:01.70 --> 00:21:05.90 So I'm thinking about was that that Japanese soldiers would ever surrender to the enemy
00:21:05.90 --> 00:21:09.58 that they were not instructed as to how they should comport themselves as they did.
00:21:09.58 --> 00:21:14.10 As a consequence, Japanese POWs were relatively fruitful source of information for Allied
00:21:14.10 --> 00:21:15.10 interrogators.
00:21:15.10 --> 00:21:18.42 I never thought about that because I've always heard that when the Japanese got captured they
00:21:18.42 --> 00:21:20.90 would like spill their guts but I never thought about why it's because they never got
00:21:20.90 --> 00:21:21.90 any training.
00:21:21.90 --> 00:21:23.98 There's like, oh, you will just die.
00:21:23.98 --> 00:21:24.98 No one's going to surrender.
00:21:24.98 --> 00:21:30.42 Well, actually we're going to surrender when this bill are guts.
00:21:30.42 --> 00:21:31.26 Fast forward a little bit.
00:21:31.26 --> 00:21:36.50 Talking about this snob situation, snob.
00:21:36.50 --> 00:21:38.10 Such a good word.
00:21:38.10 --> 00:21:43.54 A snob is one who is impressed by and therefore tries to identify with those who are higher
00:21:43.54 --> 00:21:48.94 up in the socio-economic scale while straining to disassociate himself from those lower
00:21:48.94 --> 00:21:50.18 down.
00:21:50.18 --> 00:21:56.34 By these lights, such everyday affections as name dropping and paying society magazine
00:21:56.34 --> 00:22:03.74 to publish photographs of oneself or one's nearest family are obvious examples of snob-ish
00:22:03.74 --> 00:22:05.94 nish.
00:22:05.94 --> 00:22:06.94 Name dropping.
00:22:06.94 --> 00:22:09.38 We know Echo's big on that one.
00:22:09.38 --> 00:22:13.10 I get these, one of they called chain emails.
00:22:13.10 --> 00:22:15.50 No, not a chain email like an automatic email.
00:22:15.50 --> 00:22:16.50 Yeah.
00:22:16.50 --> 00:22:17.50 Spam emails, right?
00:22:17.50 --> 00:22:20.50 It'll say, congratulations, Jaco Willink.
00:22:20.50 --> 00:22:26.30 You have been named as CEO of the year or as entrepreneur of the year or of entrepreneur
00:22:26.30 --> 00:22:30.38 of the decade and we, you know, congratulations.
00:22:30.38 --> 00:22:33.30 This is an incredible thing.
00:22:33.30 --> 00:22:38.22 And we would want to send you the full magazine that you will be published in along with
00:22:38.22 --> 00:22:45.02 a plaque recognizing your incredible achievements as a business leader.
00:22:45.02 --> 00:22:48.02 And the cost is over $11,399.
00:22:48.02 --> 00:22:50.66 And it's kind of funny, right?
00:22:50.66 --> 00:22:53.70 But then you got to remember, man, I've been to some people's offices when I got some
00:22:53.70 --> 00:22:57.34 plaque on the walls and now I know where they come from.
00:22:57.34 --> 00:23:01.18 Now I know where they come from.
00:23:01.18 --> 00:23:06.94 As a general role, snobbish behavior betoken some underlying feeling of inferiority.
00:23:06.94 --> 00:23:11.66 It is a common characteristic of the social climber of the individual with low self-esteem
00:23:11.66 --> 00:23:16.02 of the person who feels threatened or persecuted because of some real or imagined in
00:23:16.02 --> 00:23:17.02 inadequacy.
00:23:17.02 --> 00:23:20.82 So when you deal with someone that's a snob, they actually are feeling inferior.
00:23:20.82 --> 00:23:24.90 That there is an underlying pathology to the condition seems fairly obvious for two
00:23:24.90 --> 00:23:25.90 reasons.
00:23:25.90 --> 00:23:31.90 Firstly, those who are emotionally secure are rarely snobbish.
00:23:31.90 --> 00:23:35.42 Isn't that a nice thing to know and understand if you're emotionally secure, you're
00:23:35.42 --> 00:23:37.10 not going to be a snob?
00:23:37.10 --> 00:23:43.58 Secondly, the behavior is itself irrational, compulsive, and self-defeating.
00:23:43.58 --> 00:23:49.82 After all, even the most hardened snob must know that other people are adept at seeing
00:23:49.82 --> 00:23:51.78 through his affections.
00:23:51.78 --> 00:23:55.82 So you're going to act that way, you know people, because I explained this all the time
00:23:55.82 --> 00:23:59.86 to clients and at the most, I usually have to spend some time on this.
00:23:59.86 --> 00:24:01.54 Everyone can see what you're thinking.
00:24:01.54 --> 00:24:03.10 Your intent has a smell.
00:24:03.10 --> 00:24:05.82 It's so obvious.
00:24:05.82 --> 00:24:06.82 And you know it.
00:24:06.82 --> 00:24:09.02 And you deep down, you know it.
00:24:09.02 --> 00:24:12.14 Sometimes it's shocking, though, because I don't think people do know it.
00:24:12.14 --> 00:24:13.14 I think I agree with that.
00:24:13.14 --> 00:24:15.14 No, I mean, to what he's saying, right?
00:24:15.14 --> 00:24:22.82 Oh, he's saying that unless I'm hearing you incorrectly, he's saying that deep down, you
00:24:22.82 --> 00:24:26.74 know that behavior is observed by other people.
00:24:26.74 --> 00:24:32.14 And to me, that that's what makes the behavior crazy is the willingness to have that
00:24:32.14 --> 00:24:34.74 thought and go, no, no, I can get away with this.
00:24:34.74 --> 00:24:37.02 You know, I can do this differently.
00:24:37.02 --> 00:24:38.90 I can see it in him super obvious.
00:24:38.90 --> 00:24:41.78 But when I do this, it's not going to come across the snobbish.
00:24:41.78 --> 00:24:42.78 Yeah.
00:24:42.78 --> 00:24:43.78 That's the part for me.
00:24:43.78 --> 00:24:45.98 It's like that's crazy to think that you can pull it off.
00:24:45.98 --> 00:24:47.78 That is that is crazy.
00:24:47.78 --> 00:24:49.74 And I see that all the time.
00:24:49.74 --> 00:24:52.26 All the people think they're so smart.
00:24:52.26 --> 00:24:54.06 Think no one's noticing these little maneuvers.
00:24:54.06 --> 00:24:56.06 They're making it so obvious.
00:24:56.06 --> 00:25:04.22 Yes, so remember when we went on a little, we were talking about it a lot for some reason.
00:25:04.22 --> 00:25:05.90 And so I thought about it.
00:25:05.90 --> 00:25:09.46 And I don't think it's the kind of where they think I'm getting away with it.
00:25:09.46 --> 00:25:10.66 I don't think that's the thought.
00:25:10.66 --> 00:25:15.30 I think the thought is like, they're paying attention to what they're saying and all this
00:25:15.30 --> 00:25:16.30 stuff.
00:25:16.30 --> 00:25:19.50 But in their mind, instead of, oh, I look snobby and dumb or whatever that I'm doing this
00:25:19.50 --> 00:25:21.66 name drop in and all that, they don't think that.
00:25:21.66 --> 00:25:26.26 They think, oh, when I name drop, these people are going to think that I'm as cool as I'm
00:25:26.26 --> 00:25:27.26 trying to be.
00:25:27.26 --> 00:25:28.26 It's going to work.
00:25:28.26 --> 00:25:29.26 Yeah.
00:25:29.26 --> 00:25:31.58 But today's point, they see someone else name drop.
00:25:31.58 --> 00:25:35.10 And they go, right, freaking echoes over there trying to name drop.
00:25:35.10 --> 00:25:36.10 Yeah.
00:25:36.10 --> 00:25:37.10 Oh, yeah.
00:25:37.10 --> 00:25:41.66 It's like, but there's a little hints of that way of backwards thinking where it applies
00:25:41.66 --> 00:25:42.86 everyone else to not me, right?
00:25:42.86 --> 00:25:44.86 I'm super paranoid about that.
00:25:44.86 --> 00:25:49.70 Bro, and that's a good quality because then it, you know, the kind, it's a old joke
00:25:49.70 --> 00:25:53.70 where people give great relationship advice, right?
00:25:53.70 --> 00:25:56.86 They think they give such good relationship advice, but everyone's like, you don't have
00:25:56.86 --> 00:25:57.86 any good relationships.
00:25:57.86 --> 00:25:59.34 You know, that kind, you know, right?
00:25:59.34 --> 00:26:05.94 So it's kind of everywhere where we think that it applies to everyone else and doesn't
00:26:05.94 --> 00:26:08.58 apply to me or it applies to me and no one else or whatever.
00:26:08.58 --> 00:26:09.94 And that's what Dave says.
00:26:09.94 --> 00:26:10.94 Yeah.
00:26:10.94 --> 00:26:14.14 It's like, oh, this, I can, I can name drop.
00:26:14.14 --> 00:26:15.14 Yes.
00:26:15.14 --> 00:26:16.14 And it's pretty cool.
00:26:16.14 --> 00:26:17.14 Effective, exactly.
00:26:17.14 --> 00:26:18.14 So yeah.
00:26:18.14 --> 00:26:19.14 But they see someone else doing it.
00:26:19.14 --> 00:26:20.14 They're like, yeah, make sure.
00:26:20.14 --> 00:26:22.62 Or even the snob, you, I know some snops.
00:26:22.62 --> 00:26:23.62 Unfortunately.
00:26:23.62 --> 00:26:26.70 And I get the same impression kind of like, right?
00:26:26.70 --> 00:26:30.62 Because snob's special when they're behaving in a snobby way, it looks dumb.
00:26:30.62 --> 00:26:33.78 Like, it's kind of embarrassing, especially if you know the person in like, I'm even a
00:26:33.78 --> 00:26:34.78 little bit.
00:26:34.78 --> 00:26:35.78 It's kind of embarrassing.
00:26:35.78 --> 00:26:38.18 Like, you wish they wouldn't for their sake act like that.
00:26:38.18 --> 00:26:42.38 But you can tell they think, oh my gosh, these people must be so impressed with my,
00:26:42.38 --> 00:26:43.38 with my standards.
00:26:43.38 --> 00:26:44.38 You know, my high standards.
00:26:44.38 --> 00:26:50.42 Speaking of just brand me, males, I get these, I get invites to podcasts.
00:26:50.42 --> 00:26:51.42 Yeah.
00:26:51.42 --> 00:26:52.42 Hell yeah.
00:26:52.42 --> 00:26:56.66 And the podcast invite will say, you don't recently had this person.
00:26:56.66 --> 00:27:01.74 It's just literally just a list of name dropping stuff.
00:27:01.74 --> 00:27:04.82 And I think to myself, bro, what are you doing?
00:27:04.82 --> 00:27:07.26 Tell me about, you know, what your podcast is about.
00:27:07.26 --> 00:27:08.62 It's, they didn't even play around.
00:27:08.62 --> 00:27:11.10 They're just like, have this person this person, this person, this person, this person,
00:27:11.10 --> 00:27:12.10 this person.
00:27:12.10 --> 00:27:13.10 You think, man.
00:27:13.10 --> 00:27:15.02 Yeah, they think it was a little game too.
00:27:15.02 --> 00:27:17.38 There's a little status.
00:27:17.38 --> 00:27:18.98 You know, they're one of that.
00:27:18.98 --> 00:27:19.98 They can get you on.
00:27:19.98 --> 00:27:21.38 Then they could get this person on.
00:27:21.38 --> 00:27:23.34 Then they're listing you at every freaking chance.
00:27:23.34 --> 00:27:24.34 They got that.
00:27:24.34 --> 00:27:25.34 Yeah.
00:27:25.34 --> 00:27:26.34 Yeah.
00:27:26.34 --> 00:27:29.78 It's freaking savagery in the freaking podcast zone.
00:27:29.78 --> 00:27:33.90 That's the book.
00:27:33.90 --> 00:27:40.94 There is nothing, for example, quite so transparent as name dropping or displaying invitations.
00:27:40.94 --> 00:27:45.82 He must know it's some level of this behavior provokes at best amusement at worst ridicule,
00:27:45.82 --> 00:27:47.66 contempt or even dislike.
00:27:47.66 --> 00:27:51.90 But he is nonetheless powerless to curb his snobbishness.
00:27:51.90 --> 00:27:53.38 Something drives him on.
00:27:53.38 --> 00:27:54.38 I like that.
00:27:54.38 --> 00:27:59.06 I like the way it takes, like, you have to drive through it.
00:27:59.06 --> 00:28:03.10 But why should the military be snobbish?
00:28:03.10 --> 00:28:07.10 Firstly, because traditionally top levels of the military hierarchy were occupied by the
00:28:07.10 --> 00:28:12.46 rich and highly borne, the notions of socioeconomic and military status came.
00:28:12.46 --> 00:28:17.26 It just became completely related.
00:28:17.26 --> 00:28:23.06 Then it goes on to say, officers are also stressed from within to know that they have
00:28:23.06 --> 00:28:28.66 wedded their lives to essentially destructive ends, that they should, that they shoulder
00:28:28.66 --> 00:28:33.30 great responsibilities, that they may be called upon to carry out tasks far beyond their
00:28:33.30 --> 00:28:38.98 capabilities and that the price of failure is enormous, is quite sufficient to initiate
00:28:38.98 --> 00:28:42.66 feelings of uneasiness.
00:28:42.66 --> 00:28:45.94 Even notions of retirement are fraught with stress.
00:28:45.94 --> 00:28:51.14 The knowledge that most ex-officeers have little value on the civilian labor market, that
00:28:51.14 --> 00:28:57.54 there are a lot of total obscurity of gential poverty that they only, that only the very
00:28:57.54 --> 00:29:03.94 best and very worst of full generals and above are likely to achieve immortality and that none
00:29:03.94 --> 00:29:09.62 of them will ever again command the absolute obedience to which they have grown accustomed
00:29:09.62 --> 00:29:14.66 that can hardly be described as reassuring.
00:29:14.66 --> 00:29:15.82 That's kind of crazy, right?
00:29:15.82 --> 00:29:19.74 You're in the military, you're an officer, you get out, people are looking.
00:29:19.74 --> 00:29:24.38 You think you're the still man, ain't happened.
00:29:24.38 --> 00:29:30.14 To the factors underlying the self-protective and compensating aspects of snobbish,
00:29:30.14 --> 00:29:36.06 snobbishness must be added what is perhaps the most important one of all pre-existing doubts
00:29:36.06 --> 00:29:38.06 of the self.
00:29:38.06 --> 00:29:42.70 Since, as we noted earlier, there is much in militarism to attract those without
00:29:42.70 --> 00:29:48.14 about their masculinity and intellectual capacity, it would not be surprising to find that
00:29:48.14 --> 00:29:54.38 a number of men with problems over self-esteem will be discovered at all levels of the military
00:29:54.38 --> 00:29:55.38 hierarchy.
00:29:55.38 --> 00:29:57.18 Why do we have a bunch of snobbs?
00:29:57.18 --> 00:30:01.22 Well, because they're insecure about who they are.
00:30:01.22 --> 00:30:05.18 One piece of corroborative evidence for these views comes from yet another characteristic
00:30:05.18 --> 00:30:09.02 of many military organizations.
00:30:09.02 --> 00:30:12.46 Their notorious sensitivity to criticism.
00:30:12.46 --> 00:30:16.90 People don't like to be criticized.
00:30:16.90 --> 00:30:18.94 They're not as far to talk about little bit in talking of criticism.
00:30:18.94 --> 00:30:22.22 It might seem that we are making a great deal of fuss about nothing.
00:30:22.22 --> 00:30:24.66 After all, nobody likes criticism.
00:30:24.66 --> 00:30:29.46 And as far and as for complaints against military historians, it is only natural, indeed
00:30:29.46 --> 00:30:32.94 audible that some show loyalty to one's group, because he had gone on to a little thing
00:30:32.94 --> 00:30:40.86 about how some mismilitary historians don't say anything bad about leaders from the military.
00:30:40.86 --> 00:30:45.54 But he said, you know, he said, that's understandable because they kind of have a little
00:30:45.54 --> 00:30:47.18 bit of hero worship going on.
00:30:47.18 --> 00:30:52.22 But he goes on to say, there are some special features of the phenomenon in some military
00:30:52.22 --> 00:30:53.86 men which deserve attention.
00:30:53.86 --> 00:31:00.14 In the first place, their sensitivity seems out of all proportion to that of other public
00:31:00.14 --> 00:31:01.46 figures.
00:31:01.46 --> 00:31:06.02 In terms of fame or notoriety, well-known generals or admirals are on the level with film
00:31:06.02 --> 00:31:10.74 stars, politicians, and even newsworthy academics.
00:31:10.74 --> 00:31:16.38 It's one would expect that they might come to accept the possibility of negative publicity
00:31:16.38 --> 00:31:22.34 as part of the game, a small price to pay, for the perks which they otherwise enjoy.
00:31:22.34 --> 00:31:24.26 This they seem unable to do.
00:31:24.26 --> 00:31:28.86 In fact, there is a distinctly paranoid element in the way some senior commanders have
00:31:28.86 --> 00:31:31.90 reacted to even the faintest breath of criticism.
00:31:31.90 --> 00:31:36.78 To the vaguest and most tactful suspicion of a raised eyebrow are cleared throat, almost
00:31:36.78 --> 00:31:46.78 as if they were being held personally responsible for everything that might go wrong.
00:31:46.78 --> 00:31:51.78 By the way, you should be held for a lot of irony.
00:31:51.78 --> 00:31:53.10 There's a lot of irony in that one.
00:31:53.10 --> 00:32:00.06 You get these people that are insecure and they end up being snobbs.
00:32:00.06 --> 00:32:04.86 He closes out this section saying, in touching upon this delicate matter, we must not lose
00:32:04.86 --> 00:32:09.02 sight of this evidence significance and relevance in the present context.
00:32:09.02 --> 00:32:16.62 Whatever else it may be, sensitivity to criticism is a measure of insecurity.
00:32:16.62 --> 00:32:18.34 That's so important to remember.
00:32:18.34 --> 00:32:26.14 You look like so insecure when you get offended by criticism.
00:32:26.14 --> 00:32:31.54 In implies a weak ego, which in turn, by way of compensation manifests itself in particular
00:32:31.54 --> 00:32:35.98 character traits, one of which is snobbishness.
00:32:35.98 --> 00:32:40.34 Whether this ego weakness is due to some early shock to self-esteem or fear of the
00:32:40.34 --> 00:32:45.54 breakthrough of unacceptable impulses or some combination of the two influences, the individual
00:32:45.54 --> 00:32:50.98 so afflicted, develop certain defenses which help to minimize his painful feelings.
00:32:50.98 --> 00:32:56.98 This fine support and yet another feature of military organizations, their cults of anti-affemination.
00:32:56.98 --> 00:33:04.54 It's going into our next chapter, anti-affemination.
00:33:04.54 --> 00:33:06.22 We don't want to be feminine.
00:33:06.22 --> 00:33:08.74 We want to be masculine.
00:33:08.74 --> 00:33:12.70 It says there's a quote in here from General Chaffey.
00:33:12.70 --> 00:33:16.26 Let war cease altogether and a nation will become a feminine.
00:33:16.26 --> 00:33:20.82 We just need war.
00:33:20.82 --> 00:33:26.78 He goes here saying, when discussing the various anxieties which militarism serves to reduce
00:33:26.78 --> 00:33:33.06 brief mention was made of the fears which some men entertain about their masculinity.
00:33:33.06 --> 00:33:39.26 This thus, it was pointed out that though primarily concerned with combating the dread
00:33:39.26 --> 00:33:46.22 of disorder and dissolution, certain setorial aspects of bullshit might also help to reassure
00:33:46.22 --> 00:33:50.30 those with problems in this area.
00:33:50.30 --> 00:33:57.30 They say in there, they impose discipline because you're anti-feminist.
00:33:57.30 --> 00:34:07.98 Ampty, feminine, feminists, feminists, feminine or feminists.
00:34:07.98 --> 00:34:17.06 And that some of these, you know, imposing your will on people means you're not like
00:34:17.06 --> 00:34:20.58 a feminine.
00:34:20.58 --> 00:34:26.46 Are we getting into the kind of the weird zone of this book a little bit?
00:34:26.46 --> 00:34:30.86 He says, in putting together the jigsaw of military incompetence, therefore we now, we
00:34:30.86 --> 00:34:36.66 can now take up a piece, one piece which clearly has great relevance to the topic.
00:34:36.66 --> 00:34:41.82 The striking of version towards a feminacy which characterizes some military organizations
00:34:41.82 --> 00:34:47.02 and this despite the fact that the female is usually regarded as, quote, more deadly than
00:34:47.02 --> 00:34:48.02 the male.
00:34:48.02 --> 00:34:52.82 Okay, so I had to, I don't know, this was written in 1976.
00:34:52.82 --> 00:34:57.50 Obviously this is a topic that might be addressed differently today but what I did want
00:34:57.50 --> 00:35:01.74 to do, what I did look up is I said, okay, what is a feminine characteristic and what
00:35:01.74 --> 00:35:07.42 is a masculine character and a characteristic, generally speaking.
00:35:07.42 --> 00:35:10.74 Now, okay, I'll just go to read them first.
00:35:10.74 --> 00:35:14.82 And this is coming from some website about psychology, right?
00:35:14.82 --> 00:35:19.86 Masculine strong controlled focused powerful centered purpose driven loves a challenge
00:35:19.86 --> 00:35:25.98 and competition single task oriented problem solver wants freedom and release makes big
00:35:25.98 --> 00:35:27.70 things small.
00:35:27.70 --> 00:35:33.54 Forgets needs admiration and appreciation wants to be needed and respected.
00:35:33.54 --> 00:35:39.50 They're the masculine intimacy killer is being criticized controlled or shut out.
00:35:39.50 --> 00:35:44.94 So those are the masculine characteristics.
00:35:44.94 --> 00:35:46.66 Here's the feminine characteristics.
00:35:46.66 --> 00:35:50.74 Free flowing open radiance.
00:35:50.74 --> 00:35:59.82 Wild, destructive, emotion driven seeks and gives love, nurtureer, multitasker, diffused
00:35:59.82 --> 00:36:08.10 awareness wants to gather, talk, vent, makes small things big.
00:36:08.10 --> 00:36:15.30 Members needs reassurance and attention wants trust connection and praise.
00:36:15.30 --> 00:36:19.30 The intimacy killer is feeling unseen, unsafe or misunderstood.
00:36:19.30 --> 00:36:29.62 Now, clearly these things every human has both these things in a spectrum and you could
00:36:29.62 --> 00:36:33.90 call, you didn't need, I think what makes them challenging to talk about in this day and
00:36:33.90 --> 00:36:41.02 age they put man and woman on them, what they should have done is said, just black and white
00:36:41.02 --> 00:36:42.34 to do.
00:36:42.34 --> 00:36:45.62 Yeah, yng and yng would have been perfect.
00:36:45.62 --> 00:36:48.34 You got the yng personality, you got the Yng personality.
00:36:48.34 --> 00:36:50.98 Here's how they are not necessarily men and women because let's face it.
00:36:50.98 --> 00:36:54.62 We know a lot of women that are strong controlled and focused, we know a lot of men that
00:36:54.62 --> 00:36:57.86 are free flowing open radiance, right?
00:36:57.86 --> 00:37:01.86 But I think they're generally speaking psychologically here some characteristics.
00:37:01.86 --> 00:37:03.14 So that's where we're at.
00:37:03.14 --> 00:37:04.46 Dave, are you concerned yet?
00:37:04.46 --> 00:37:10.30 Is this the freaking podcast that gets us banned finally?
00:37:10.30 --> 00:37:11.30 I don't know.
00:37:11.30 --> 00:37:16.38 No, I'm concerned at the depth that this guy is going into to explain what I think is
00:37:16.38 --> 00:37:20.58 going to be a series of behaviors that we're going to discuss that are really deep.
00:37:20.58 --> 00:37:28.10 Yes, it's interesting because what he's saying is and what he says is that the military
00:37:28.10 --> 00:37:32.94 can shut out these feminine characteristics and that's not good.
00:37:32.94 --> 00:37:33.94 Yeah.
00:37:33.94 --> 00:37:34.94 That's what he's about to say.
00:37:34.94 --> 00:37:35.94 Yeah.
00:37:35.94 --> 00:37:40.18 One of the negative characteristics of a militaristic organization is that it doesn't
00:37:40.18 --> 00:37:46.14 have enough of the feminine characteristics, for instance, free and open mind.
00:37:46.14 --> 00:37:47.14 Right?
00:37:47.14 --> 00:37:48.14 Those are bad.
00:37:48.14 --> 00:37:52.58 If you don't have those, you're in a bad situation.
00:37:52.58 --> 00:38:00.14 So he goes on to say evidence of this aversion is of necessity, circumstantial.
00:38:00.14 --> 00:38:01.62 He didn't brace it such a phenomenal.
00:38:01.62 --> 00:38:08.82 So here's some things that kind of show maybe this anti-affeminate role that you have
00:38:08.82 --> 00:38:10.14 in the military.
00:38:10.14 --> 00:38:17.70 One of the important to attach to such outward signs of sexual identification as hair length.
00:38:17.70 --> 00:38:23.98 Just the insistence on short back and sides seems correlated with those periods in history
00:38:23.98 --> 00:38:27.22 when sexual differentiation was linked to hair length.
00:38:27.22 --> 00:38:32.58 We can dismiss excuses of neatness and hygiene as rationalizations.
00:38:32.58 --> 00:38:38.94 Field Marshal Lord Wolsey stated the true case when he said it is very difficult to make
00:38:38.94 --> 00:38:41.78 an Englishman at any time look like a soldier.
00:38:41.78 --> 00:38:52.54 He is fond of his longish hair, hair is the glory of a woman but the shame of a man.
00:38:52.54 --> 00:38:58.34 So what he's saying is listen, it's not about hygiene, it's not about convenience, which
00:38:58.34 --> 00:39:00.54 by the way, I totally disagree with this.
00:39:00.54 --> 00:39:09.82 I think having short hair is totally convenient, low maintenance, hygienic, neat.
00:39:09.82 --> 00:39:11.74 That's why I have the hair that I have.
00:39:11.74 --> 00:39:16.74 When my hair gets longer than three quarters of an inch, which has been for a long time,
00:39:16.74 --> 00:39:18.46 I can't stand it.
00:39:18.46 --> 00:39:23.58 I don't think I can look at a woman, I need to shave my head right now, not even in the
00:39:23.58 --> 00:39:24.58 ballpark.
00:39:24.58 --> 00:39:26.70 Dude, I think he's stretching here.
00:39:26.70 --> 00:39:28.30 I think he's doing a stretch.
00:39:28.30 --> 00:39:36.26 In fact, the other thing is how do you bring uniformity to a person's hair?
00:39:36.26 --> 00:39:37.26 You cut it off.
00:39:37.26 --> 00:39:41.58 Otherwise, you have some dude with long red hair, you got some other dude with curly
00:39:41.58 --> 00:39:47.06 hair, you got another dude with no hair, you got all these different hair styles.
00:39:47.06 --> 00:39:49.54 And now, the sun, we look different.
00:39:49.54 --> 00:39:50.98 We're not trying to look different.
00:39:50.98 --> 00:39:55.14 And you know how like when people grow old, they have like longer hair and it starts
00:39:55.14 --> 00:39:58.98 to go in front of their face and they go with it back with their head.
00:39:58.98 --> 00:40:02.86 That's a functionality thing, I get it, but it looks pretty feminine.
00:40:02.86 --> 00:40:03.86 Okay.
00:40:03.86 --> 00:40:09.90 What about when you see a fighter, a professional fighter in the ultimate fighting championship,
00:40:09.90 --> 00:40:12.66 and he has to adjust his hair while he's fighting, by the way.
00:40:12.66 --> 00:40:13.66 Same kick, right?
00:40:13.66 --> 00:40:17.02 Same kick, it doesn't make him any less on the fighter, but then I get technically
00:40:17.02 --> 00:40:22.10 right, you got to do one more step for efficiency or whatever I guess, but you know,
00:40:22.10 --> 00:40:25.86 isn't that a sexual thing when girls do that, flip their hair?
00:40:25.86 --> 00:40:27.82 That's like a mating thing, right?
00:40:27.82 --> 00:40:30.90 I was just gonna play a great way to watch in that dude fight.
00:40:30.90 --> 00:40:32.34 And they're like, bro, how do you see?
00:40:32.34 --> 00:40:34.90 And he's constantly messing with his hair and it doesn't seem to affect him on that
00:40:34.90 --> 00:40:35.90 much.
00:40:35.90 --> 00:40:36.90 That's true.
00:40:36.90 --> 00:40:37.90 And his hair was so freaking wild.
00:40:37.90 --> 00:40:40.30 It was almost like a target disruptor.
00:40:40.30 --> 00:40:42.66 Like they see his hair would be moving around.
00:40:42.66 --> 00:40:44.66 Same thing with big ass beards.
00:40:44.66 --> 00:40:50.30 Like how does that not throw off your punch to someone's chin when they've got a beard,
00:40:50.30 --> 00:40:51.50 a big beard.
00:40:51.50 --> 00:40:52.50 That's a problem.
00:40:52.50 --> 00:40:57.42 I don't know if this is true, but I distinctly remember being told, and I don't even
00:40:57.42 --> 00:41:01.58 know who told me, but you're hair, the one of the reasons they talked about you're
00:41:01.58 --> 00:41:04.42 hair being short is they don't want somebody to be able to use your hair as a way
00:41:04.42 --> 00:41:06.62 to manipulate your head during hand-hand combat.
00:41:06.62 --> 00:41:10.42 Freaking on your head and you know, so I don't know that being like in a regulation
00:41:10.42 --> 00:41:14.26 as the explanation, but being told, hey, if the guy can grab your hair and pull your
00:41:14.26 --> 00:41:16.70 head because your hair's too long, you're wrong.
00:41:16.70 --> 00:41:17.82 That's the puts you into disadvantage.
00:41:17.82 --> 00:41:19.02 You can't do that.
00:41:19.02 --> 00:41:26.18 So 100% my, I've always, my role was this my role of me, but I will say, I kind of
00:41:26.18 --> 00:41:30.78 talked to my son about this and however, maybe I'm wrong, didn't really tell my daughters
00:41:30.78 --> 00:41:31.78 this.
00:41:31.78 --> 00:41:35.22 I said, hey, if your hair is long enough for someone to grab, then that's a problem.
00:41:35.22 --> 00:41:37.42 You don't want to have hair that's long enough for someone to grab.
00:41:37.42 --> 00:41:39.06 I told that to my son.
00:41:39.06 --> 00:41:42.22 I didn't, I might have told to my daughters, but I didn't enforce it.
00:41:42.22 --> 00:41:43.22 Right?
00:41:43.22 --> 00:41:49.10 So I guess I'm whatever, what is that?
00:41:49.10 --> 00:41:50.10 Sex is?
00:41:50.10 --> 00:41:51.10 Yeah.
00:41:51.10 --> 00:41:55.30 No, you know, sex is, but you know, what is it when you treat someone different?
00:41:55.30 --> 00:41:56.30 Right?
00:41:56.30 --> 00:41:57.30 You discriminate a little bit.
00:41:57.30 --> 00:41:58.30 Yeah, whatever.
00:41:58.30 --> 00:42:02.86 Although I've told, I told all my daughters, like, hey, I can take care of this problem.
00:42:02.86 --> 00:42:06.30 We can shave that head. I always offer my daughters haircuts.
00:42:06.30 --> 00:42:07.66 They've never said yes.
00:42:07.66 --> 00:42:09.86 Yeah, I say it as a joke.
00:42:09.86 --> 00:42:14.14 I don't know if I don't want to shave my daughter's head, but I told my son the same thing.
00:42:14.14 --> 00:42:15.62 I was like, yeah, you do want it short.
00:42:15.62 --> 00:42:16.62 Yeah.
00:42:16.62 --> 00:42:19.62 So when you get in a fight or whatever, they can't grab your head or the hair like that.
00:42:19.62 --> 00:42:22.02 Oh, that's what is double standard.
00:42:22.02 --> 00:42:24.02 I had the double standard.
00:42:24.02 --> 00:42:25.02 Sure.
00:42:25.02 --> 00:42:26.86 Although I didn't, I gave them the job.
00:42:26.86 --> 00:42:28.46 Yeah, but you didn't enforce it, though.
00:42:28.46 --> 00:42:30.50 Wait, did you enforce it with your son, though?
00:42:30.50 --> 00:42:32.30 No, but I mean, it kind of makes sense.
00:42:32.30 --> 00:42:36.50 Hey, so it's for as your role and your level of enforcement, it was the same.
00:42:36.50 --> 00:42:37.50 Oh, hey, how they behave.
00:42:37.50 --> 00:42:38.50 That's different.
00:42:38.50 --> 00:42:39.50 They got different lights.
00:42:39.50 --> 00:42:40.50 I get it.
00:42:40.50 --> 00:42:44.54 I kind of thought I might get my middle, when my middle daughter was wrestling.
00:42:44.54 --> 00:42:47.54 You know, and going into some freaking savagery.
00:42:47.54 --> 00:42:49.34 Yeah, they don't have a lot of wrestling, though.
00:42:49.34 --> 00:42:50.34 Or they do.
00:42:50.34 --> 00:42:51.34 No, they don't.
00:42:51.34 --> 00:42:52.34 But still, let's face it for principle.
00:42:52.34 --> 00:42:53.34 Let's face it.
00:42:53.34 --> 00:42:54.34 You roll it.
00:42:54.34 --> 00:42:55.82 Your female wrestler and you roll it with the shit.
00:42:55.82 --> 00:42:56.82 It's kind of like, fuck rose.
00:42:56.82 --> 00:42:57.82 Right?
00:42:57.82 --> 00:42:58.82 Yep.
00:42:58.82 --> 00:42:59.82 We're not looking at fuck rose thinking hell.
00:42:59.82 --> 00:43:00.82 Yeah.
00:43:00.82 --> 00:43:01.82 We are.
00:43:01.82 --> 00:43:02.82 Yeah.
00:43:02.82 --> 00:43:03.82 Yeah.
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:04.82 Even her opponent.
00:43:04.82 --> 00:43:05.82 Yeah.
00:43:05.82 --> 00:43:06.82 She's a professional.
00:43:06.82 --> 00:43:07.82 Yeah.
00:43:07.82 --> 00:43:09.42 She's never had shame the first time.
00:43:09.42 --> 00:43:14.46 But you know, my daughter would get the cornbreads, like the real tight braids.
00:43:14.46 --> 00:43:16.94 That's kind of a war mode to this.
00:43:16.94 --> 00:43:18.82 You can't grab those, by the way.
00:43:18.82 --> 00:43:19.82 Yeah, I mean, in the back.
00:43:19.82 --> 00:43:23.10 Yeah, well, if you have some kind of a ponytail sticking out the back, but for some
00:43:23.10 --> 00:43:24.26 of my daughter, they don't have that.
00:43:24.26 --> 00:43:25.26 They would just tight.
00:43:25.26 --> 00:43:26.26 Interesting.
00:43:26.26 --> 00:43:27.26 Well, does.
00:43:27.26 --> 00:43:28.86 Well, is it the same for beard, though?
00:43:28.86 --> 00:43:29.86 Like a big beard?
00:43:29.86 --> 00:43:30.86 Totally.
00:43:30.86 --> 00:43:31.70 Like you can grab the beard.
00:43:31.70 --> 00:43:32.70 Yeah.
00:43:32.70 --> 00:43:34.54 If I'm going to be like, it's the exact same thing.
00:43:34.54 --> 00:43:36.26 I look at someone with a big beard, I think.
00:43:36.26 --> 00:43:37.26 Handle.
00:43:37.26 --> 00:43:41.26 You must be super, super double extra confident to think that someone's not going to
00:43:41.26 --> 00:43:43.94 regain a wrist wrap on that bad boy.
00:43:43.94 --> 00:43:45.58 It's slam your head in the pavement.
00:43:45.58 --> 00:43:46.58 Right.
00:43:46.58 --> 00:43:53.38 Well, I feel like the beard is in a less opportune position, I guess.
00:43:53.38 --> 00:43:54.78 Technically, still very useful.
00:43:54.78 --> 00:43:55.78 Yeah.
00:43:55.78 --> 00:43:56.78 Very useful.
00:43:56.78 --> 00:44:00.10 But, you know, on the top of the head, that's like, I'd say there's like a good level
00:44:00.10 --> 00:44:01.58 or two more control.
00:44:01.58 --> 00:44:02.58 Yeah.
00:44:02.58 --> 00:44:05.02 It's very shocking when I see guys in front here.
00:44:05.02 --> 00:44:09.50 Again, you must have a lot of confidence that someone's not going to grab you.
00:44:09.50 --> 00:44:11.78 And that's one of my favorite takedowns on the battlefield.
00:44:11.78 --> 00:44:14.22 Just grab a handful of hair and slam people down.
00:44:14.22 --> 00:44:15.22 It works good.
00:44:15.22 --> 00:44:17.78 Bro, what's the girl fights on YouTube?
00:44:17.78 --> 00:44:18.78 Oh.
00:44:18.78 --> 00:44:21.82 If you have the time, bro, that's going to be the default at some point.
00:44:21.82 --> 00:44:22.82 They're just going to grab hair.
00:44:22.82 --> 00:44:24.82 And it's like they kind of nullify both attacks.
00:44:24.82 --> 00:44:25.82 Yeah.
00:44:25.82 --> 00:44:26.82 When they're both grabbing hair.
00:44:26.82 --> 00:44:27.82 So it's man.
00:44:27.82 --> 00:44:28.82 It's like proof.
00:44:28.82 --> 00:44:29.82 You know, in the field.
00:44:29.82 --> 00:44:30.82 Yeah.
00:44:30.82 --> 00:44:34.34 It's a very, very drug-check scrapping it out on YouTube.
00:44:34.34 --> 00:44:35.34 It's totally true.
00:44:35.34 --> 00:44:36.34 It's totally true.
00:44:36.34 --> 00:44:37.34 Okay.
00:44:37.34 --> 00:44:39.70 This is a rough topic.
00:44:39.70 --> 00:44:44.34 Traditional taboos on certain topics and pastimes.
00:44:44.34 --> 00:44:51.82 Thus we find Captain Foley, commander of Britannia Naval Training Establishment for Officer
00:44:51.82 --> 00:44:58.18 Cadets at Dartmouth for bidding piano playing because he considered an effeminate.
00:44:58.18 --> 00:44:59.94 So these are the kind of dudes that are weird, right?
00:44:59.94 --> 00:45:02.34 This dude's got issues.
00:45:02.34 --> 00:45:05.74 And he's going hard against piano playing because he's got some weird stuff going on.
00:45:05.74 --> 00:45:06.74 Yeah, right?
00:45:06.74 --> 00:45:07.74 Yeah.
00:45:07.74 --> 00:45:12.10 Another one a deeply rooted prejudice toward women who try to adopt traditional
00:45:12.10 --> 00:45:14.22 male roles.
00:45:14.22 --> 00:45:16.22 See that?
00:45:16.22 --> 00:45:21.54 Finally an equation between defensive behavior and defemination.
00:45:21.54 --> 00:45:25.38 So if you're on defense, that means you're being effeminate.
00:45:25.38 --> 00:45:33.06 The feeling that it is scissy to wear ear protectors or build head covers has undoubtedly
00:45:33.06 --> 00:45:39.06 caused much undecisert unnecessary destruction of the human body.
00:45:39.06 --> 00:45:44.38 It is not an unreasonable hypothesis to suggest that it's most glaring and costly illustration
00:45:44.38 --> 00:45:47.86 occurred in connection with the issue of convoys.
00:45:47.86 --> 00:45:51.98 In the first World War, hundreds of thousands of tons of merchant shipping was lost through
00:45:51.98 --> 00:45:56.86 the Navy's refusal to adopt the convoys system.
00:45:56.86 --> 00:46:03.18 When Lloyd George eventually forced convoys upon an unwilling admiralty, losses fell
00:46:03.18 --> 00:46:04.66 significantly.
00:46:04.66 --> 00:46:07.38 So their idea was, hey, I'm charging my ship.
00:46:07.38 --> 00:46:10.74 I'm not going to go with a pack, not weak.
00:46:10.74 --> 00:46:12.82 I'm not going into convoys.
00:46:12.82 --> 00:46:13.82 That's weak.
00:46:13.82 --> 00:46:16.62 I'm a man and I'm going to take this thing so low.
00:46:16.62 --> 00:46:18.34 And they were losing ships all the time.
00:46:18.34 --> 00:46:19.34 Finally someone's ate, bro.
00:46:19.34 --> 00:46:21.86 You guys got to stick together.
00:46:21.86 --> 00:46:24.62 The lesson was plain for all to see.
00:46:24.62 --> 00:46:31.30 But in the years between the wars, the same irrational dislike of mothering a flock of ships
00:46:31.30 --> 00:46:36.10 prevented the development of an efficient escort system.
00:46:36.10 --> 00:46:40.10 So the brits started taking losses in World War I.
00:46:40.10 --> 00:46:43.26 World War II, same freaking bad move.
00:46:43.26 --> 00:46:48.30 Then America entered the war and unbelievably in the face of overwhelming evidence insisted
00:46:48.30 --> 00:46:53.46 on trying to defeat you, you boats without the use of convoys, same thing.
00:46:53.46 --> 00:46:54.54 This is World War II.
00:46:54.54 --> 00:46:58.54 We already know that you should stick together.
00:46:58.54 --> 00:47:03.50 Between December 1941 and the following March, American losses of merchant shipping grew
00:47:03.50 --> 00:47:08.30 to the staggering monthly total of 500,000 tons.
00:47:08.30 --> 00:47:12.78 Eventually the price of aggressive masculinity embodied in the so-called patrol and hunting
00:47:12.78 --> 00:47:17.06 operations of isolated warships proved too costly.
00:47:17.06 --> 00:47:21.18 And convoys were instituted between Boston and Halifax.
00:47:21.18 --> 00:47:26.18 Losses on this route promptly dropped to zero.
00:47:26.18 --> 00:47:31.66 But South of Boston's ship still sailed independently until June of the number of ships
00:47:31.66 --> 00:47:35.58 sunk reaching all time record of 700,000 tons in a single month.
00:47:35.58 --> 00:47:37.46 They still didn't do it.
00:47:37.46 --> 00:47:40.50 Considered week, it's considered feminine.
00:47:40.50 --> 00:47:44.66 That's the, okay, hindsight 2020, again it.
00:47:44.66 --> 00:47:50.14 But when you kind of think of the big picture, it makes more sense than it might appear
00:47:50.14 --> 00:47:51.14 at first.
00:47:51.14 --> 00:47:55.90 Because remember back in the day when seat belts weren't what you call legal.
00:47:55.90 --> 00:47:58.98 Or it was legal still to not receive belt.
00:47:58.98 --> 00:48:02.26 Then there's like, and then there's a little transition period where it's like, yeah, if
00:48:02.26 --> 00:48:05.86 you know where your seat belts kind of like, ah, like what you scared, like kind of weaker
00:48:05.86 --> 00:48:06.86 whatever.
00:48:06.86 --> 00:48:08.86 Same thing with the kids and the helmets.
00:48:08.86 --> 00:48:11.34 Like, oh yeah, you're just riding in the cold of secret now.
00:48:11.34 --> 00:48:13.10 Brad, the helmet is that even necessary?
00:48:13.10 --> 00:48:18.78 Or you see the kids with the elbow pads, you know, it's kind of like, okay, cool, you're
00:48:18.78 --> 00:48:22.74 safe, but come on, let's say that's kind of weak, you know.
00:48:22.74 --> 00:48:29.42 But the truth is, bro, if you care about like the safety or whether it be efficiency,
00:48:29.42 --> 00:48:34.54 safety, not dying, like all these things, brother, helmet's going to make a lot of sense.
00:48:34.54 --> 00:48:35.54 Right.
00:48:35.54 --> 00:48:38.90 After a while, you're going to kind of realize that then it's like, okay, what's more
00:48:38.90 --> 00:48:42.78 cool now, living or not wearing that helmet?
00:48:42.78 --> 00:48:43.78 Yep.
00:48:43.78 --> 00:48:46.70 Yeah, that's a good one.
00:48:46.70 --> 00:48:49.18 That's, sorry, see, I see, we're just staying in the mind is what I'm saying.
00:48:49.18 --> 00:48:52.18 So it took these guys a little while to get over the state of mind, like, hey, we kind
00:48:52.18 --> 00:48:53.58 of look like a sissy.
00:48:53.58 --> 00:48:54.58 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:48:54.58 --> 00:48:57.58 Because of we're going in a con.
00:48:57.58 --> 00:48:59.34 Yeah, I don't even know, but he holding my hand.
00:48:59.34 --> 00:49:00.58 Yeah, you know, I got this.
00:49:00.58 --> 00:49:01.58 Like, yeah.
00:49:01.58 --> 00:49:02.58 All right, good.
00:49:02.58 --> 00:49:05.26 Did any of your dudes not want to wear eye pro?
00:49:05.26 --> 00:49:08.58 Remember, eye pro, those clear in what situation?
00:49:08.58 --> 00:49:11.94 It was like going out and literally going out on a mission.
00:49:11.94 --> 00:49:12.94 Yeah, me.
00:49:12.94 --> 00:49:13.94 Shut up.
00:49:13.94 --> 00:49:20.98 I don't say why it had nothing to do with, if, depending on how much movement was taken
00:49:20.98 --> 00:49:22.66 place, it was like, oh, I'm just kidding.
00:49:22.66 --> 00:49:24.18 It was like, that's what a lot.
00:49:24.18 --> 00:49:25.98 And they would be not.
00:49:25.98 --> 00:49:27.42 They wouldn't be functional for me.
00:49:27.42 --> 00:49:32.14 That's that is a, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of
00:49:32.14 --> 00:49:33.14 like a sissy.
00:49:33.14 --> 00:49:33.90 Yeah, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of like a sissy.
00:49:33.90 --> 00:49:35.90 Yeah, that's a legitimate reason to do to close the aisle of like a sissy.
00:49:35.90 --> 00:49:38.90 You could wear eye pro, you should, if you can, you should.
00:49:38.90 --> 00:49:39.90 Yeah.
00:49:39.90 --> 00:49:44.30 And I only asked that because I remember that being a, like, long conversation with,
00:49:44.30 --> 00:49:49.58 with folks, not just on my team, but all the people who were with about not wearing
00:49:49.58 --> 00:49:53.62 eye pro out on missions, not the fogging and the sweat of that was standing, which I fully
00:49:53.62 --> 00:49:56.26 understandable and there's different ways, different ones to do it and do, didn't want
00:49:56.26 --> 00:49:58.46 to do it because they didn't like the way it looked.
00:49:58.46 --> 00:49:59.46 Mm.
00:49:59.46 --> 00:50:00.46 Really?
00:50:00.46 --> 00:50:03.46 Well, all you had to do is authorize me where freaking sunglasses, they said, okay, get them.
00:50:03.46 --> 00:50:04.46 They'll fuck their teeth.
00:50:04.46 --> 00:50:05.46 Yeah.
00:50:05.46 --> 00:50:08.30 It's weird though because I always wear sunglasses.
00:50:08.30 --> 00:50:09.30 Always.
00:50:09.30 --> 00:50:13.30 Always wear sunglasses, but I never wore sunglasses in the field ever.
00:50:13.30 --> 00:50:14.30 And I don't know.
00:50:14.30 --> 00:50:18.82 I didn't seem like just in the way plus they would fog up, they would get sweaty.
00:50:18.82 --> 00:50:19.82 Yeah.
00:50:19.82 --> 00:50:24.26 Is there anything in, I guess in the battlefield, it might be more black and white, but
00:50:24.26 --> 00:50:29.50 like in training or something like that where it's like maybe something optional or
00:50:29.50 --> 00:50:34.50 something that people don't want to wear or do that's for safety reasons, but it's like,
00:50:34.50 --> 00:50:37.98 it's like, it's not cool or it's like, you would ever sweat like that.
00:50:37.98 --> 00:50:39.30 There's a ton of things.
00:50:39.30 --> 00:50:40.98 In aviation gloves, they're always a big one.
00:50:40.98 --> 00:50:41.98 Gloves, yeah.
00:50:41.98 --> 00:50:44.18 Do's in one of where gloves.
00:50:44.18 --> 00:50:48.98 And then they'd always show like these videos of like post-dejection trauma to your hands
00:50:48.98 --> 00:50:54.58 or fingers getting literally, they'd call it getting declerved when your skin would come
00:50:54.58 --> 00:50:59.98 off your hand and leave the bone behind that pictures of guys exiting the cockpit on
00:50:59.98 --> 00:51:02.82 ejections and stuff or getting burn and things like that.
00:51:02.82 --> 00:51:05.66 So, like, gloves would stop you from getting declerved.
00:51:05.66 --> 00:51:06.66 Yes.
00:51:06.66 --> 00:51:14.42 So, if you have like a ring or a or your climate up or something like that and you didn't
00:51:14.42 --> 00:51:18.42 have something covering that that could get caught, there's a famous picture, all the
00:51:18.42 --> 00:51:20.58 any avian are listening to this will no exactly what I'm talking with.
00:51:20.58 --> 00:51:24.62 There's a famous picture like the Gazette or whatever a magazine of a dude hand on the
00:51:24.62 --> 00:51:28.90 table like this who's wearing his wedding ring and his hands there, this whole thing
00:51:28.90 --> 00:51:33.54 has gone all this errors is the remaining piece of bone left on his hand, you know,
00:51:33.54 --> 00:51:35.50 trying to get people to wear gloves.
00:51:35.50 --> 00:51:36.50 People didn't want to wear gloves.
00:51:36.50 --> 00:51:38.14 Did you wear a wedding ring?
00:51:38.14 --> 00:51:39.14 Yes.
00:51:39.14 --> 00:51:40.50 I'll do your gloves.
00:51:40.50 --> 00:51:41.50 Yes.
00:51:41.50 --> 00:51:42.86 Did you always wear gloves?
00:51:42.86 --> 00:51:45.58 Yes, I was a glove wearer.
00:51:45.58 --> 00:51:48.14 And then why would you not want to wear gloves?
00:51:48.14 --> 00:51:51.42 The complaint was like, oh, it's the tactile like I want to press the buttons and turn
00:51:51.42 --> 00:51:54.50 the knobs and it's harder to feel and like, can you know, can you cut the fingertips
00:51:54.50 --> 00:51:55.50 off?
00:51:55.50 --> 00:51:56.50 Yes.
00:51:56.50 --> 00:51:57.50 Did you do that?
00:51:57.50 --> 00:51:58.50 No.
00:51:58.50 --> 00:52:01.06 Now what would eventually happen is like you'd wear through them and sometimes the
00:52:01.06 --> 00:52:03.66 fingers would actually you probably even see them in the videos.
00:52:03.66 --> 00:52:07.34 I'm like, move them my things up and down and the gloves are kind of afraid and whatnot.
00:52:07.34 --> 00:52:08.82 But it was just to your point.
00:52:08.82 --> 00:52:12.66 It was a conversation that I was found odd to be quite honest.
00:52:12.66 --> 00:52:15.78 The reason I wore gloves is like the first day of light school that guy was like, you
00:52:15.78 --> 00:52:17.34 will wear your gloves and like, okay, Roger that.
00:52:17.34 --> 00:52:19.14 No, I'm not here to like, I used to it.
00:52:19.14 --> 00:52:21.54 I'm not here to like tell you, I don't like the way it feels.
00:52:21.54 --> 00:52:22.54 I didn't even think about it.
00:52:22.54 --> 00:52:26.46 Put my gloves on and strap them on and that was the end of that.
00:52:26.46 --> 00:52:28.74 I never found my own style.
00:52:28.74 --> 00:52:31.54 I have to like, you know, I don't like this.
00:52:31.54 --> 00:52:34.18 Wasn't in my I didn't, I wasn't in care or think about those things.
00:52:34.18 --> 00:52:35.90 And you got used to it totally.
00:52:35.90 --> 00:52:36.90 I want you to get used to it.
00:52:36.90 --> 00:52:37.90 It doesn't really go.
00:52:37.90 --> 00:52:38.90 It's no factor.
00:52:38.90 --> 00:52:39.90 Yeah, it's no factor at all.
00:52:39.90 --> 00:52:43.90 But there are people that these are conversations and think to the point is like, those
00:52:43.90 --> 00:52:47.14 conversations about I'm not wearing this for the functionality versus I don't like the
00:52:47.14 --> 00:52:48.14 way it looks.
00:52:48.14 --> 00:52:49.14 Those are two totally different things.
00:52:49.14 --> 00:52:50.54 You tell me, hey, get's fogged up.
00:52:50.54 --> 00:52:51.70 I can't see sweat.
00:52:51.70 --> 00:52:55.98 I remember sweat being drawn and down the glass and like these are gone immediately.
00:52:55.98 --> 00:52:59.58 This is as I look in the mirror, my all I'm all kitted up about to go, I don't like the
00:52:59.58 --> 00:53:00.58 way I look.
00:53:00.58 --> 00:53:04.34 I'm not having those conversations in my mind about how I look when I'm doing this.
00:53:04.34 --> 00:53:10.26 Yeah, well, the fact of knowing you can get your freaking strap in your eyes, you know,
00:53:10.26 --> 00:53:13.86 little chunks of brass in your eyes, little chunks of crap in your eyes.
00:53:13.86 --> 00:53:14.86 Like that sucks.
00:53:14.86 --> 00:53:18.46 Especially Dave Burke, who has a hundred percent plan of going back to flying an airplane
00:53:18.46 --> 00:53:20.50 with his whole ground situation as over.
00:53:20.50 --> 00:53:22.90 You were like, I'm a person for my eyes.
00:53:22.90 --> 00:53:28.82 I was never one-protected.
00:53:28.82 --> 00:53:35.98 So he goes on to this section here where he starts to use this term, butch.
00:53:35.98 --> 00:53:41.66 And it's not, it's just basically saying like, I guess we would say like hyper, manly, like
00:53:41.66 --> 00:53:44.26 a manly man, he uses this term butch.
00:53:44.26 --> 00:53:51.02 He says by selecting and promoting on the basis of such blutch criteria as size, strength,
00:53:51.02 --> 00:53:56.46 physical courage and prowess at games, the armed forces tend to ignore other attributes,
00:53:56.46 --> 00:54:01.74 which really may be of even greater importance to a senior commander, intelligence,
00:54:01.74 --> 00:54:06.62 high educational level, resistance to breakdown under stress, and substantial reserves of moral
00:54:06.62 --> 00:54:12.38 courage. Well, clearly this goes down where we're just picking the kind of the tough it's
00:54:12.38 --> 00:54:17.50 due to be in charge instead of the smartest dude. Not that the smartest dude is necessarily the
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:24.46 right one either, because we see smart people that are really dumb. There is of course a counter
00:54:24.46 --> 00:54:29.34 argument, namely that generals should be heroic leaders, which would necessitate them having at
00:54:29.34 --> 00:54:34.46 least some of the aforementioned butch traits. Sheer physical size, the possession of decorations
00:54:34.46 --> 00:54:40.22 for bravery and a find or rugger record, would, according to this argument, confer invaluable leadership
00:54:40.22 --> 00:54:46.22 qualities upon top military commanders. Unhappily, this theory does not stand up, and by rugger,
00:54:46.22 --> 00:54:53.42 he means a rung be player. Being good at rugger, in no way ensures the best qualities of military
00:54:53.42 --> 00:54:59.90 leadership. So called masculine attributes count for very little in comparison with personality
00:54:59.90 --> 00:55:08.78 and knowing one's job. The most cursory glance at military history suggests that many of the
00:55:08.78 --> 00:55:13.90 really great military and naval commanders, Napoleon Nelson, Wholford instance, were men of
00:55:13.90 --> 00:55:18.38 brain and character, not of huge bodies with dazzling records in the field of sport.
00:55:19.66 --> 00:55:25.66 Of general ship Montgomery says the science and art of command involves an intimate knowledge
00:55:25.66 --> 00:55:32.62 of human nature. A commander must think two stages ahead. He speaks globally of the physical,
00:55:32.62 --> 00:55:38.14 physically frail wolf and Nelson, describing the latter as a brilliant semen and most original
00:55:38.14 --> 00:55:43.42 intelligent and courageous fighter. In the same vein, he comments on the flexibility and brilliant
00:55:43.42 --> 00:55:49.74 intellect of Napoleon. But nowhere does the field marshal talk about the advantages of fine
00:55:49.74 --> 00:55:54.94 physique, hairy masculinity and a reputation for long-distance running polo or boxing.
00:55:56.70 --> 00:56:03.66 So these manly traits, butch traits, according to this book, might not be the most important thing.
00:56:03.66 --> 00:56:10.78 In fact, he's indicating that they are not the most important thing. We are concerned to relate
00:56:10.78 --> 00:56:16.94 and explain to indisputable phenomenon. So called peaceful generals who in times of stress reveal
00:56:16.94 --> 00:56:24.14 themselves as passive, dependent and indecisive and the anti-affemination, ethos of some military
00:56:24.14 --> 00:56:27.90 organizations to handle these facts the following points were made.
00:56:27.90 --> 00:56:35.98 Some men, for reasons rooted in early family situation, have serious doubts about their
00:56:35.98 --> 00:56:43.10 sexual adequacy and or physical strength and size. Such men may deal with their feelings of inferiority
00:56:43.10 --> 00:56:49.82 by adopting a compensatory style of life in which they strive for reassurance in some
00:56:49.82 --> 00:56:57.10 suitably symbolic role. The prevailing ethos of many military organizations provides this reassurance
00:56:57.10 --> 00:57:02.78 hence a percentage of men will seek acceptance by the armed forces simply because such acceptance
00:57:02.78 --> 00:57:10.62 is a warranty of their masculinity. Once in their continuing and underlying feet of a fear
00:57:10.62 --> 00:57:16.62 of a feminacy produces that well-known pattern of behavior which we have termed butch.
00:57:17.74 --> 00:57:24.46 But this behavior itself is highly valued in the armed forces. Hence the individual not only
00:57:24.46 --> 00:57:30.62 profits by but also contributes to the anti-affemination of his parent organization,
00:57:30.62 --> 00:57:37.18 it is in his interest to do so. And last, the significance of all this for military and
00:57:37.18 --> 00:57:42.86 competence is that butch characteristics are not perhaps the most important criteria for top-level
00:57:42.86 --> 00:57:49.74 leadership. So he's talking about, when I was thinking about this, you definitely see some people
00:57:49.74 --> 00:57:56.70 like this where you can see that they're in the military to try and maybe compensate for some
00:57:57.66 --> 00:58:02.78 fears in their own head. And I think it's real obvious just like we talk the obviousness of
00:58:02.78 --> 00:58:07.98 someone that's a snob, someone that's a name dropper. Because let's face it, there's some guys in
00:58:07.98 --> 00:58:13.02 the military that are 100% badass military dudes and like that's just how they are.
00:58:13.02 --> 00:58:19.02 This idea that you get some people that are countering their innate
00:58:21.10 --> 00:58:26.70 feminine traits by just trying to act super tough. You see some of those guys, I don't think it's very
00:58:26.70 --> 00:58:34.38 widespread. You certainly see some of them, but it's not, it's not that common. When you see it,
00:58:34.38 --> 00:58:38.62 it's very obvious that that's what you're dealing with. They're usually over the top with their
00:58:38.62 --> 00:58:45.10 behavior. But then I think the most important thing that he's saying is that in the military,
00:58:45.10 --> 00:58:50.62 sometimes that you start to focus on that. We don't want someone that's going to raise their hand
00:58:50.62 --> 00:58:55.98 and have an open mind to stuff or going to, I mean, think about some of these feminine
00:58:55.98 --> 00:59:10.62 traits that are good, multitasker, wants to talk, communicate, remembers things, free, flowing,
00:59:10.62 --> 00:59:16.30 and open. A motion driven, we talk all the time about the fact that we don't want people to make
00:59:16.30 --> 00:59:19.82 emotional decisions, but you don't want someone that doesn't have any emotion, because that's how
00:59:19.82 --> 00:59:25.90 you end up with a commander that's just sending people to the other death. So to, well, that's
00:59:25.90 --> 00:59:30.14 why we wrote the dichotomy of leadership. All these myth mask that infeminent traits,
00:59:30.78 --> 00:59:34.94 you need them both. And you need to have balance. You need to have balance in the individuals,
00:59:34.94 --> 00:59:37.66 and then you need to have balance in a unit. You might have, you know, you're going to need some
00:59:37.66 --> 00:59:44.14 people in your platoon that just are killers. But if you have a whole platoon filled with killers,
00:59:44.14 --> 00:59:49.34 that's going to be a problem. And you need to have some people in your platoon that are very empathetic.
00:59:50.38 --> 00:59:53.10 But if you have a whole platoon of empathetic people, you're not going to be able to get
00:59:53.10 --> 00:59:58.54 any mission stuff. So you need a balance of these feminine and masculine traits. You need to have
00:59:58.54 --> 01:00:07.26 the proper balance of ying and ying. So where does toxic masculinity fit into all this? Or is this
01:00:07.26 --> 01:00:12.78 just talking about toxic, but since it was written back in, you know, before the term before the term,
01:00:12.78 --> 01:00:17.82 the toxic masculinity, I wrote an article about this one time. The toxic masculinity is when you take
01:00:17.82 --> 01:00:23.34 any of the considered traditional masculine traits and you take them to an extreme. And then you
01:00:23.34 --> 01:00:30.46 end up with someone that's, quote, toxic masculine. So here's the thing, when I wrote that article,
01:00:30.46 --> 01:00:35.50 I wrote about, because they were saying, you know, being competitive is a toxic masculine trait.
01:00:35.50 --> 01:00:44.06 No, it's not. It's a good trait to have. Being strong. That's a masculine trait. Is it toxic? No.
01:00:44.06 --> 01:00:53.34 Do what's another one? Um, being purpose driven. That's a masculine trait according to this list.
01:00:53.90 --> 01:00:58.06 Is that a bad thing? If you take it to an extreme, when you got someone that's they just want to
01:00:58.06 --> 01:01:02.38 win and then it's actually people, yeah, that's bad. If you want someone that wants to be just so
01:01:02.38 --> 01:01:06.62 strong and powerful that they'll just step on other people, that's bad. So if you take some of
01:01:06.62 --> 01:01:12.54 these things to extreme, they're a problem. And when I ended up saying in that article, there's these,
01:01:12.54 --> 01:01:19.50 these are good characteristics for for a person to have, including my three daughters. I want my
01:01:19.50 --> 01:01:25.66 daughters to be assertive. I want them to be strong. I want them to be competitive. What you want
01:01:25.66 --> 01:01:29.10 you don't want your daughters to be like that? No, of course. You want your sons to be like that,
01:01:29.10 --> 01:01:33.50 too. Do you want any of your kids to go too far in those directions? No, absolutely not.
01:01:34.54 --> 01:01:40.30 So the toxic masculinity, I think is when you start taking any of these characteristics to the
01:01:40.30 --> 01:01:46.78 extreme, it becomes a problem. Is that answer your question? Yeah, I'm wondering if this is
01:01:46.78 --> 01:01:51.98 essentially like what he's talking about before it was actually like a phrase. Yeah, and I think if
01:01:51.98 --> 01:01:56.22 you get an organization where they've gone too far in one direction, it's a problem. Yeah.
01:01:57.42 --> 01:02:00.30 Now, well, so we got just people that are just following orders, just ultra obedient,
01:02:00.86 --> 01:02:05.98 because that's what the the masculine thing is we just want to we want to obey and be part of the team.
01:02:05.98 --> 01:02:11.18 Okay, cool. Yeah. Not good. Okay.
01:02:13.42 --> 01:02:18.54 Chapter 20, leaders of men, how can the ability to lead depend on the ability to follow? You might
01:02:18.54 --> 01:02:23.74 as well say that the ability to float depends on the ability to sink. That's an interesting quote,
01:02:23.74 --> 01:02:31.10 which I don't agree with. The ability to lead, you don't necessarily, no, sorry,
01:02:31.10 --> 01:02:38.46 in order to follow, you don't necessarily, doesn't mean necessarily you're going to be a good
01:02:38.46 --> 01:02:44.54 leader, but if you're going to be a good leader, you better know how to follow as well. So that
01:02:44.54 --> 01:02:50.06 quote right there, which is from the Peter Principal, don't agree with it. Whatever it's other causes
01:02:50.06 --> 01:02:54.78 military incompetence implies a failure in leadership. This is hardly surprising of psychological
01:02:54.78 --> 01:03:01.18 problems, which beset military officers, few exceed and severity those associated with leadership.
01:03:01.18 --> 01:03:05.82 In this respect, they're required to fulfill incompatible roles. They're expected to show initiative,
01:03:06.70 --> 01:03:11.90 yet remain hemmed in by regulations. They must be aggressive, yet never in support of it. They must
01:03:11.90 --> 01:03:17.34 be a serious and caring for their men, yet maintaining enormous social distance. They must
01:03:17.34 --> 01:03:21.50 know everything about everything yet never appear intellectual. Finally, as we saw in the last
01:03:21.50 --> 01:03:26.54 chapter, they may well have been selected for attributes almost totally unrelated to the task they
01:03:26.54 --> 01:03:30.14 expected to perform. So that's an entire list of dichotomies of leadership.
01:03:34.14 --> 01:03:39.34 Discussing this of leadership is so often overloaded with vague, but a motive idea is that one is
01:03:39.34 --> 01:03:44.62 hard to put the nail to nail the concept down. So now he's trying to come up with a, with a
01:03:44.62 --> 01:03:53.34 definition for leadership. To cut through the monopoly of such quasi moral and unacceptable
01:03:54.38 --> 01:04:00.54 associations as patriotism. Play up and play the game. Never asking your men do something you
01:04:00.54 --> 01:04:06.06 wouldn't do for yourself. Not giving up. The square jaw, frank eyes of steadfast gaze. These are all
01:04:06.06 --> 01:04:11.58 like these sort of leadership things. If you'll, if you'll be a man, recipe, so he's given all these kind
01:04:11.58 --> 01:04:18.06 of traditional quotes about leadership and then he gives his, the simple truth that leadership
01:04:18.06 --> 01:04:23.26 is no more than exercising such an influence upon others that they tend to act and concert
01:04:23.26 --> 01:04:28.22 towards achieving a goal which they might not have achieved so readily had they been left to their
01:04:28.22 --> 01:04:34.78 own devices. Fair enough. Does that an epic definition of leadership? Not really.
01:04:34.78 --> 01:04:43.34 But it's a decent one. The ingredients which bring about this favorable state of affairs are
01:04:43.34 --> 01:04:50.06 many and varied. The most superficial level at the most superficial level, they are believed to include
01:04:50.06 --> 01:04:57.50 such factors as voice, stature and appearance, impression of omniscience, trustworthiness,
01:04:57.50 --> 01:05:03.98 sincerity and bravery. Add a deeper and rather more important level, leadership depends on a proper
01:05:03.98 --> 01:05:11.02 understanding of the needs and opinions of those one hopes to lead and the context in which
01:05:11.02 --> 01:05:16.86 leadership occurs. So that's a great definition. Well not so much a definition but it's a great point.
01:05:16.86 --> 01:05:21.58 Hey, your voice, your stature, your trustworthiness, your sincerity, your bravery. Those things
01:05:21.58 --> 01:05:26.14 are all important. But guess what's even more important? Understanding the needs and opinions of
01:05:26.14 --> 01:05:32.30 the people you're leading. That's what he's saying right there. So he nails that part straight up
01:05:32.30 --> 01:05:37.90 in short, there's nothing mysterious romantic or necessarily lovable about leadership in military
01:05:37.90 --> 01:05:44.54 organizations. Leaders are appointed rather than emergent. That is to say the needs of the
01:05:44.54 --> 01:05:50.78 individual soldier play almost no role in deciding the sort of leader he gets. Secondly, the military
01:05:50.78 --> 01:05:56.22 leader possesses constitutional power of a magnitude which surpasses that of leaders in most
01:05:56.22 --> 01:06:02.54 other human groups. If he cannot pull his followers by force of character, he can at least push
01:06:02.54 --> 01:06:08.54 them by force a law. I don't really bind to that too much. That's like, you know, because in
01:06:08.54 --> 01:06:11.34 the civilian world, oh, you don't want to do it. I'm telling you, call him in a fire you.
01:06:11.98 --> 01:06:15.98 Which you can do just like in the military, you can say shut up and do what I told you to do
01:06:15.98 --> 01:06:21.42 because I, you know, I have the backing of the constitution behind me, neither one of those are
01:06:21.42 --> 01:06:27.98 good leadership and they won't pan out for very long. The third and related feature of military
01:06:27.98 --> 01:06:33.90 leadership is that it essentially is essentially autocratic and operates in what modern theorists
01:06:33.90 --> 01:06:41.66 call a wheel net rather than an all channel communication net. In other words, the flow of essential
01:06:41.66 --> 01:06:48.30 information is too and fro between the leader and his subordinates rather than between all members of
01:06:48.30 --> 01:06:55.34 the group, not very surprisingly the wheel net, though no doubt gratifying to autocratic leaders
01:06:55.34 --> 01:07:00.94 produces more errors, slower solutions to problems and reduce gratification to the group, then
01:07:00.94 --> 01:07:06.86 does the more democratic all channel net. That's interesting. You want to participate with your whole
01:07:06.86 --> 01:07:12.78 group. I think that's how I operate. It doesn't really matter who comes with an ideal. We're good
01:07:12.78 --> 01:07:18.62 with it. Let's share it. In light of these considerations, it just perhaps trains that leadership
01:07:18.62 --> 01:07:23.98 in the British armed forces should have been as effective as it has. So he's like saying it's amazing
01:07:23.98 --> 01:07:28.70 that the British military was so effective because they freaking operate on these principles that suck.
01:07:30.86 --> 01:07:36.30 Since a salient feature of and by the way, you want to know why the soldiers, the soldiers get the
01:07:36.30 --> 01:07:42.38 job done. Since a salient feature of all the campaign so far considered has been a remarkable
01:07:42.38 --> 01:07:48.22 absence of the mutinist tendencies and a quite astonishing degree of tolerance for a dude
01:07:48.22 --> 01:07:53.42 and bravery shown by the common soldier. We have to ask was this despite or because of the leaders
01:07:53.42 --> 01:08:01.10 I'm going to go ahead and say despite in many cases. I saw this with many, many platoons over the
01:08:01.10 --> 01:08:08.22 years. You could have bad leadership, but if you have a few pipe hitters in there, then they will
01:08:08.22 --> 01:08:17.66 make things happen and that platoon will be successful even with bad leadership. Despite the leadership,
01:08:17.66 --> 01:08:22.54 they'll be successful. The first point of note is the distinction that has to be drawn between
01:08:22.54 --> 01:08:30.30 two roles of a leader, task specialist and social specialist. A task specialist is a leader's
01:08:30.30 --> 01:08:36.78 prime concern as a task specialist. A leader's prime concern is to achieve the group's goal
01:08:36.78 --> 01:08:43.34 in the case of the military defeating the enemy. For such a role being likable is rather less
01:08:43.34 --> 01:08:47.98 important trait than that of being more active, more intelligent and better informed than his followers.
01:08:48.78 --> 01:08:54.38 In his capacity as a social specialist, however, a leader's main function is to preserve good
01:08:54.38 --> 01:09:00.70 personal relations with the group. And within the group, thereby maintaining morale as to keep the
01:09:00.70 --> 01:09:08.94 group in being. In the military, may lose the function of a successful social specialist who would
01:09:08.94 --> 01:09:16.70 prevent mutiny and reduce such symptoms as low morale, absenteeism, desertion, sickness, and crime.
01:09:16.70 --> 01:09:21.66 Not very surprisingly, the most important attribute of such a leader is that he should be liked.
01:09:22.86 --> 01:09:29.42 A efficiency and task ability are of rather secondary importance. So this is something,
01:09:29.42 --> 01:09:34.30 I think, I wrote leadership strategy and tactics. But what is it leader trying to do? Build relationships
01:09:34.30 --> 01:09:38.22 in that team. Not just between yourself but between the whole team. That's what we're trying to do.
01:09:38.22 --> 01:09:45.26 That's what we're here for. And that task thing kind of works itself out. If you're doing a good
01:09:45.26 --> 01:09:48.22 job, build those relationships, that task thing is going to kind of handle itself.
01:09:50.62 --> 01:09:56.78 I'm just having such a hard time. He's using so many words. And what I'm actually trying to do is
01:09:56.78 --> 01:10:02.78 get my head wrapped around like 1970s England. So I'm trying to do. Because it's like, hey, how
01:10:02.78 --> 01:10:09.58 about I take those 12 pages and just write balance? You know what I mean? And yeah, even inside that,
01:10:09.58 --> 01:10:13.98 just like you, and I think the order in which you said it is the right thing is if he called it
01:10:13.98 --> 01:10:18.22 like democratic, we all feel part of it. Is everybody thinks I care about you? If my people think I care
01:10:18.22 --> 01:10:23.26 about them, they're going to get on board with a plan. And if I'm an autocrat and I tell people what to do
01:10:23.26 --> 01:10:28.14 and they have to do what they say no matter what, they're going to struggle with the plan. And if you
01:10:28.14 --> 01:10:34.62 go with that second, that first one, they'll do even harder things that are more challenging,
01:10:34.62 --> 01:10:38.46 more life threatening and less likely to be successful on paper or at least to their own risk,
01:10:39.42 --> 01:10:43.66 then if they don't think that I care about them, they'll be less likely to do hard things like
01:10:44.54 --> 01:10:49.10 combat. And then inside that, the little subtle point, and I'm glad you said it because I had
01:10:49.10 --> 01:10:53.66 exact same thought as even when that leadership doesn't reveal itself, which it clearly has not,
01:10:54.78 --> 01:10:58.14 there's another layer of leadership inside there. You know, you could call it your NCOs,
01:10:58.14 --> 01:11:01.50 whatever the term that you want to use those those pipe hitters inside your organization,
01:11:02.46 --> 01:11:06.46 they're still going to make it happen. Yeah, and just to make sure everyone understands
01:11:06.46 --> 01:11:09.50 when you want your team to think you care about them, how do you make that happen?
01:11:10.06 --> 01:11:15.66 You can have to care about them. And I shouldn't say, I should use a different word
01:11:15.66 --> 01:11:20.46 when they believe that. Not when they think that, but I'm trying to convince them of that.
01:11:20.46 --> 01:11:26.22 Yeah. When they come to believe that and go, oh, yeah, this guy cares. He really does. That's
01:11:26.22 --> 01:11:30.62 that is a that's a better way to describe and that's really what you're saying. Not that I,
01:11:30.62 --> 01:11:35.34 I manipulate them to thinking that, it's when they recognize it for themselves and they, and they see that.
01:11:35.34 --> 01:11:36.22 Yeah. They believe that.
01:11:38.30 --> 01:11:43.98 Says here, it has been shown that whereas low-stressed groups, operating situations that are
01:11:43.98 --> 01:11:50.38 devoid of painful uncertainties do best under democratic leadership, organizations like the military,
01:11:50.38 --> 01:11:56.86 in times of war that are subject to stressing ambiguities, actually prefer autocratic leadership.
01:11:57.90 --> 01:12:03.58 In other words, the feelings of dependency induced by stress, successful, successfully neutralized
01:12:03.58 --> 01:12:09.18 a person's normal, a versity toward the autocratic leader.
01:12:09.18 --> 01:12:16.22 While a man like towns and would not be likely to survive for very long in a modern civilian firm,
01:12:16.22 --> 01:12:23.66 his autocratic mean was lovingly accepted by men whose lives were hanging by a thread.
01:12:24.94 --> 01:12:29.18 So the reason that he points all this out is that these guys, some of these guys like towns,
01:12:30.38 --> 01:12:32.70 they still listen to him. They obeyed him.
01:12:32.70 --> 01:12:42.70 And what's interesting about this is he's making a huge generalization of organizations like
01:12:42.70 --> 01:12:47.18 the military in times of war, subject to stressing ambiguities prefer autocratic leadership.
01:12:47.98 --> 01:12:57.74 Let me tell you where the subtlety here is. 97% 98% 99% of the time even in a war.
01:12:57.74 --> 01:13:04.54 We want democratic leadership and there is a moment in time where there's confusion,
01:13:04.54 --> 01:13:09.02 where there's chaos, where there's mayhem, where everyone is looking at the leader to make a call.
01:13:09.02 --> 01:13:14.62 That happens in the military. It happens in business too. I mean, when Ashillon front hit COVID,
01:13:17.42 --> 01:13:21.98 he, we hear a bunch of ideas and then I became a little bit autocratic. He, here's what we're doing. Boom.
01:13:21.98 --> 01:13:26.06 And everyone was stoked. Don't, how, yeah, that's what we're doing.
01:13:26.06 --> 01:13:31.34 They were. And the thread that's inside both of those. And I think why autocratic behavior
01:13:31.34 --> 01:13:35.66 when you're the recipient of that, why you're willing to be treated like that or directed,
01:13:36.54 --> 01:13:39.98 if I have already made the connection on my mind that the thing that you're making me do,
01:13:39.98 --> 01:13:46.70 that you're directing me to do, is designed to help me keep me alive when my, when that that thread
01:13:46.70 --> 01:13:50.14 hangs in the, or the life hangs in the balance, whatever the word he just used there. If I make that
01:13:50.14 --> 01:13:54.86 connection and go, he's telling me to do this and what I know what he, I know why he's telling
01:13:54.86 --> 01:13:58.30 me this, did I'll follow what he was all doing. That's even bothering me. It doesn't bother me
01:13:58.30 --> 01:14:04.22 told what to do to be mandated anything for my boss if I go, oh, I see what's happening here. I'm
01:14:04.22 --> 01:14:08.94 going to go execute. Now, if you spin your whole career, being an autocratic, just tell me what to do,
01:14:09.66 --> 01:14:14.54 dude, I got news for you. Even when you actually need in those rare two, three percent
01:14:14.54 --> 01:14:19.58 occasions, you need to do that. You're in a very, very hard time getting your people to follow you.
01:14:19.58 --> 01:14:25.42 Yeah, this is a point that I made deeply in leadership strategy in tactics when I talk about
01:14:25.42 --> 01:14:31.74 leadership in the leadership vacuum. And I mean, I went into some specifics in there, like letting
01:14:31.74 --> 01:14:37.74 that vacuum exist for just a second longer just to make sure everyone feels it. I would make sure
01:14:37.74 --> 01:14:43.26 I'd wait an extra half a second or one second before I said anything to make sure everyone knew
01:14:43.26 --> 01:14:48.94 oh, damn, we don't know what we're doing right now and they are waiting to be led. They are waiting
01:14:48.94 --> 01:14:53.66 for that that autocratic leader to step in, say everyone lock it up or move into that building and
01:14:53.66 --> 01:14:57.90 they are so on board for that. If you make that call a little too early, you get resistant some
01:14:57.90 --> 01:15:03.10 people, I would, how do you know what? You got to let it, you got to let it just let it be there
01:15:03.10 --> 01:15:09.74 for a moment, let everyone see, oh, it's a vacuum. I don't know what to do and then boom. And if you wait
01:15:09.74 --> 01:15:14.14 too long, well, then some other people are churping in with their ideas, you can get some confusion.
01:15:14.14 --> 01:15:19.66 So you got to time that very well. But it's unfortunate that he says he kind of blank, it's the
01:15:19.66 --> 01:15:25.10 whole thing because it's not true. It's not a blank at statement. Even in war, people want to have
01:15:25.10 --> 01:15:29.58 more say as what's happening. He's also doing one thing that I don't agree with either,
01:15:29.58 --> 01:15:33.50 he's jogging some contrast between this military leader and that military leader is inability
01:15:33.50 --> 01:15:37.66 to be successful in the private sector because the military response at these type of behaviors
01:15:37.66 --> 01:15:47.18 in the private sector doesn't. Well, when he's talking about that, he's talking about the fact that
01:15:47.18 --> 01:15:54.22 if you have a authoritarian leader in the civilian, it's going to be less successful. Here's a
01:15:54.22 --> 01:15:58.14 point that I made the other day, which you actually know, I agree with you, you're right, that doesn't
01:15:58.14 --> 01:16:02.94 make sense. Here's why, and he doesn't point to sound in the spoke, I pointed to sound the other day.
01:16:02.94 --> 01:16:10.30 In the military, bad leaders can get promoted. Easier than bad leaders can get promoted in the
01:16:10.30 --> 01:16:14.94 civilian sector. Why is that? Because in the military, you're going to be in charge. How long
01:16:14.94 --> 01:16:20.14 were you in charge of your squadron for? Two years. And that's what that's what a military leader
01:16:20.14 --> 01:16:26.22 gets. Yep. So you get two years. And by the time that enlisted guys figure out, this guy's a
01:16:26.22 --> 01:16:30.46 jackass, it takes him sick months to confirm that. And then it's like, okay, well, now we're
01:16:30.46 --> 01:16:33.58 starting to work up. We're going to actually do nothing. Well, hey, he'll be gone. Forget about it.
01:16:33.58 --> 01:16:39.58 And that guy Dave Burke, it's promoted. Because he did his job. He did it correctly. No one said anything
01:16:39.58 --> 01:16:45.18 boom. Whereas civilian world, like you're in charge of that whatever division for years. And
01:16:45.18 --> 01:16:50.62 everybody knows it. That's another thing. Military, oh, you did one, you know, one command deployment
01:16:50.62 --> 01:16:56.14 here in Virginia, then you're going to San Diego, then you're going to Bahrain, then you're
01:16:56.14 --> 01:17:03.26 just traveling around. And you can get away with it. So that's one of the reasons I think why the,
01:17:03.26 --> 01:17:10.30 why the military can produce some bad leaders. Yes. And they can get promoted. Yeah. As long as
01:17:10.30 --> 01:17:15.10 that comment you made is understood that this success in the private sector, comparison with the
01:17:15.10 --> 01:17:20.38 success in the military sector, your point is the bad leaders might stick around. They're not
01:17:20.38 --> 01:17:24.38 good leaders by virtue of the military environment. They're bad leaders that are being
01:17:24.38 --> 01:17:28.46 that are sticking around because the military has a mechanism that's sort of a loudst for it.
01:17:28.46 --> 01:17:33.26 But just I just, I don't like the thought that there's a distinction that military leader,
01:17:34.14 --> 01:17:39.74 good military leadership is different from other types of leadership. That's 100% accurate. Yeah.
01:17:40.78 --> 01:17:47.98 Fast forward a little bit. But even given the right circumstances, an autocratic mean is no
01:17:47.98 --> 01:17:55.66 bar to being liked. We still need some more positive reasons for the extraordinary popularity of
01:17:55.66 --> 01:18:03.58 otherwise incompetent commanders. So he talks about the fact that like, why do you still like?
01:18:03.58 --> 01:18:08.46 Why did these guys like towns and who got a bunch of his men killed? Why did they still like him?
01:18:08.46 --> 01:18:14.94 Why did they still follow him? One of the reasons he talks about his success for leadership
01:18:14.94 --> 01:18:21.02 tended to occur if followers had been indulged by their leaders? That makes sense, right? Oh,
01:18:21.02 --> 01:18:25.98 if you'd actually taken care of your guys, they would be more likely to follow you. Well, that makes sense.
01:18:26.54 --> 01:18:34.62 That actually makes sense. That's a good reason. A situation in which the motivational
01:18:34.62 --> 01:18:40.14 as opposed to the intellectual aspects of leadership may lead to military disasters where obedience
01:18:40.14 --> 01:18:46.54 evoked by hero worship, blunt reason, and moral sensitivity to such an extent that the group
01:18:46.54 --> 01:18:51.42 may embark on a behavior which is a little short of suicidal. Again, he's trying to figure out
01:18:51.42 --> 01:18:55.42 why in some situations do people that are idiots still get followed?
01:18:57.50 --> 01:19:02.06 There is however one further aspect of these more nebulous qualities of leadership, which is
01:19:02.78 --> 01:19:08.14 played a not-inconsidible part in the story of military incompetence. It concerns the position
01:19:08.14 --> 01:19:15.42 which an individual occupies on two related continuas. Those of boldness to caution and
01:19:15.42 --> 01:19:20.86 impulsiveness to indecision. Over the years of military incompetence has resulted
01:19:21.74 --> 01:19:26.78 more from a dearth of boldness than from a lack of caution and more from a
01:19:26.78 --> 01:19:33.98 Paul of indecision than an excess of impulsivity. So he's saying that most of the problems that occur
01:19:33.98 --> 01:19:40.46 don't occur because action is taken to impulsive action. They actually call it happened for the other
01:19:40.46 --> 01:19:44.30 reason. Don't want to do anything. That's why the term default aggressive exists.
01:19:45.18 --> 01:19:51.18 Because if you don't do anything, chances are it's going to be bad. Your default mode should
01:19:51.18 --> 01:19:56.78 be to make something happen. Real quick, nothing interrupt. It's so autocratic. What exactly is that?
01:19:57.98 --> 01:20:03.34 It's close to a authoritarian, but it's weird. He uses the term autocratic. It's like, hey,
01:20:03.34 --> 01:20:07.42 I'm in charge. I'm in control. It's one person in control. Charge in in control.
01:20:07.98 --> 01:20:14.70 But he differentiates between autocratic meaning like listen. Hey, I'm the guy in charge. I'm going
01:20:14.70 --> 01:20:21.58 to tell us where to go and the authoritarian, which is very strong handed form of autocratic rule.
01:20:23.98 --> 01:20:30.78 He doesn't necessarily, he gives an autocratic a little bit of negativity, but he's also like,
01:20:30.78 --> 01:20:35.10 hey, you're an opportune. That's a pertune commander. It's autocratic. What he says, we're going to do.
01:20:36.38 --> 01:20:41.66 That is the reality of the situation. The better reality is a democratic.
01:20:42.78 --> 01:20:47.98 97% of the time, 3% of the time, autocratic. 3% of the time, hey, I'm in charge of this
01:20:47.98 --> 01:20:50.86 world. We're going to make happen right now. We've got to make this happen now. Boom.
01:20:50.86 --> 01:20:56.38 Yeah, it's like, I don't kind of think, I remember, okay, you know, all you have entrepreneurs,
01:20:56.38 --> 01:21:01.74 and then you have like employee types, right? Yes. And then you like certain personalities go along
01:21:01.74 --> 01:21:07.18 with each one of them. Way better, right? Because some people, it's face like they just tell me where to
01:21:07.18 --> 01:21:11.34 be. What time? And tell me what to do, men all and they'll go hard. No go and they'll do it.
01:21:11.34 --> 01:21:16.22 They'll get it. Get the job done super good, you know, within their little, within their job
01:21:16.22 --> 01:21:20.78 descriptions. Go. You know? And then some people they go crazy with that kind of stuff. And then
01:21:20.78 --> 01:21:24.62 they just rather like think and go out and call their outside the lines and all this stuff, you know?
01:21:24.62 --> 01:21:29.26 So it's like, it's a lot of critic is kind of maybe for people who are, yeah, like that, right?
01:21:29.26 --> 01:21:35.82 But here's the thing. There's everyone has a spectrum, right? And there's going to be times
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:39.58 where if you're working for me, echo, there's going to be times to the two wives, it's got
01:21:39.58 --> 01:21:43.98 boss in me around. And there'll be other times you'd be waiting for me to tell you what to, even you,
01:21:44.54 --> 01:21:51.34 as a one human can have, you can, you can transit across that spectrum. And what I'm saying is
01:21:51.34 --> 01:21:56.30 when there's a lot of pressure on and there's mayhem going on, most people are going to want
01:21:56.30 --> 01:22:01.42 somebody to tell them to what to do. I shouldn't say most, many, many people are going to say,
01:22:01.42 --> 01:22:05.50 dude, you need to tell me what to do right now because there's bad stuff going on.
01:22:05.50 --> 01:22:09.50 I'm going to that scene in saving private right right at the beginning, right? That crazy part.
01:22:09.50 --> 01:22:13.50 Yep. And then he kind of loses his hearing or something like that. This old, he just kind of,
01:22:14.54 --> 01:22:19.42 like, snaps to and disguising front of the safe and what do we do now? That's a classic.
01:22:19.42 --> 01:22:24.54 Yeah, that's kind of like that. That's a classic example of, hey, those guys are looking to be
01:22:24.54 --> 01:22:29.26 led at that moment. And it took a lot to get them to that point, but there they are.
01:22:30.62 --> 01:22:37.34 So that's a good one. One of the obvious explanations for the failure of motivational
01:22:37.34 --> 01:22:43.82 aspects of leadership is in all these instances related to the advanced age of the individuals
01:22:43.82 --> 01:22:49.50 concerned, old men are more cautious than young men and less able to make quick decisions than
01:22:49.50 --> 01:22:54.46 those whose arteries have not begun to harden. I've cut out a lot of the joke. This guy's a fun
01:22:54.46 --> 01:23:00.38 guy. I will say there are other more fundamental and pervasive reasons for these failures and
01:23:00.38 --> 01:23:04.62 leadership, which can be ascribed to the general psychopathology of military organizations. They are
01:23:04.62 --> 01:23:11.42 common denominator is anxiety. It is a feature of armed services that the penalty for error is very
01:23:11.42 --> 01:23:19.02 much more substantial than their reward for success. That is so important to remember for your
01:23:19.02 --> 01:23:25.50 organization. The penalty for error is way harder than their reward you get when you do something good.
01:23:25.50 --> 01:23:29.10 That's absolutely true in the military. So what kind of people do you end up with?
01:23:30.22 --> 01:23:34.86 Right? Whereas the Naval Officer who threw an error of judgment on the part of his
01:23:34.86 --> 01:23:38.38 subordinates puts a ship of ground will almost certainly be court-martialed and stands at
01:23:38.38 --> 01:23:43.66 fair chance of being heavily punished. They're a reward for taking a bold action which pays off
01:23:43.66 --> 01:23:47.58 maybe no more than a mention in the dispatch or some decoration with little or no effect upon
01:23:47.58 --> 01:23:54.14 promotional aspects. The net result of this bias towards negative reinforcement will be that
01:23:54.14 --> 01:24:00.22 fear of failure rather than hope of success tends to be the dominant motive force in decision-making
01:24:00.22 --> 01:24:06.78 and the higher rank the stronger this motive. There is farther to fall. This is a good thing to
01:24:06.78 --> 01:24:12.54 remember with your kids. Right? With your kids. You know, your kids operating out of fear of making
01:24:12.54 --> 01:24:19.50 a mistake. You want your kids operating all in the hope of being successful. Finally,
01:24:19.50 --> 01:24:25.50 mention must be made of a thesis put forward by Simon Raven which may bowed ill for the future.
01:24:25.50 --> 01:24:29.82 It concerns the role of false premises in the training of officers, false premises that
01:24:29.82 --> 01:24:35.10 have their origin in a simple and obvious fact that an expectation of superiority in a leader
01:24:35.10 --> 01:24:40.14 by those who led will increase the tendency to follow him. This was kind of strange.
01:24:41.50 --> 01:24:46.14 For years, it was the case that since they were drawn from a socio-economic class that was vastly
01:24:46.14 --> 01:24:50.30 inferior to that of the officers, the rank and file took for granted that their officers knew
01:24:50.30 --> 01:24:55.90 more than they did and weren't a very real sense born to lead. I.e. were born into that class
01:24:55.90 --> 01:25:00.38 which traditionally the core of officers was drawn. That's the way it used to be. You kind of were
01:25:00.38 --> 01:25:05.58 whatever, a peasant and you had this Lord that was your officer and you're like, hey,
01:25:05.58 --> 01:25:10.22 do this dude supposed to be in charge. So I'm kind of going to listen to him. Since the last
01:25:10.22 --> 01:25:14.62 word that this has changed, officers are no longer recruited exclusively from the upper classes.
01:25:14.62 --> 01:25:18.94 Comparatively, few are landed from gentry or aristocratic families. A many have not even attended
01:25:18.94 --> 01:25:23.98 a public school, which a public school in England is a private school. By the same token,
01:25:24.70 --> 01:25:29.26 the rank and file are better educated and more sophisticated than their forebears. So the troops
01:25:29.26 --> 01:25:37.10 are more educated. At first, blushes would seem all to the good, giving promise of a democratization
01:25:37.10 --> 01:25:42.86 in the profession of arms, a trend which would one day place on par with most other vocations
01:25:42.86 --> 01:25:48.38 in civilized society. Unfortunately, according to Raven Smith, Simon Ravens thesis,
01:25:48.38 --> 01:25:52.38 something quite other is happening confronted with the necessity of recruiting its officers
01:25:52.38 --> 01:25:56.78 from a section of society that would have been unthinkable and years gone by. The military has made
01:25:56.78 --> 01:26:02.86 it made what it regards as the best of a bad job by insisting that since officers must still
01:26:02.86 --> 01:26:08.78 be gentlemen where no natural gulf exists between those who lead and those who follow this must
01:26:08.78 --> 01:26:14.54 be artificially inculcated by training. So this is a little bit hard to follow, but I'm going
01:26:14.54 --> 01:26:19.50 to just give a little detail here. So you used to have these people that were lords or whatever.
01:26:20.70 --> 01:26:25.50 And so the troops were freaking peasants and they're like, cool, this guy's a lord. I should
01:26:25.50 --> 01:26:29.58 probably be less than two of them. He's a gentleman. He purports himself as a leader.
01:26:29.58 --> 01:26:34.62 Cool. I'm going to tend to follow. Then all of a sudden they started recruiting officers from wherever.
01:26:35.82 --> 01:26:41.10 And now they had to say, wait a second, they still need to be gentlemen. So we're going to
01:26:41.10 --> 01:26:47.18 inculcate this difference into them. We're going to make them into a higher class.
01:26:48.78 --> 01:26:55.34 What does inculcate? Like, sort of put that seed into them. We're going to
01:26:55.34 --> 01:27:00.70 turn them into that. We're going to plant this in them. As far as just an idea or like really,
01:27:01.82 --> 01:27:05.26 like, okay, we're going to inculcate these people. We're going to train them to beat that or we
01:27:05.26 --> 01:27:09.42 just going to plant that seed and everyone's head. So it seems like that. Yeah. So what he says is
01:27:09.42 --> 01:27:13.90 are officially inculcated. So he's like, we're going to fake this. We're going to try and make these
01:27:13.90 --> 01:27:20.38 people seem as if they're of a higher class, which is like that right there, we should already be
01:27:20.38 --> 01:27:27.26 thinking, uh oh, right. Uh oh. The following excerpts from Raven's article should make the
01:27:27.26 --> 01:27:32.30 matter plain. We start with a glimpse of life at the Royal Military Academy and later at the school
01:27:32.30 --> 01:27:39.02 of infantry at warminster in the 1950s, according to Raven, the products of this training regimen
01:27:39.02 --> 01:27:43.74 may be as bizarre as those depicted in the four character studies, which conclude this section.
01:27:44.54 --> 01:27:49.98 Here we go. Silluting at Sanhurst is tremendous. If you walk round Sanhurst,
01:27:49.98 --> 01:27:53.90 looking remotely as if you might be an officer, you will receive an incestant barrage of
01:27:53.90 --> 01:27:58.86 compliments. The muddy boy in PT shorts will stop running square shoulders and snap his eyes
01:27:58.86 --> 01:28:04.06 in your direction like knives. The elegant young gentleman in the brown trillbee will lift it from
01:28:04.06 --> 01:28:08.14 his head with a controlled jerk to replace it in the exact number of seconds later at a precise
01:28:08.14 --> 01:28:12.54 in the same angle, boys in uniform with sticks, swords, rifles or submachine guns will perform
01:28:12.54 --> 01:28:16.46 a volume of intricate movements alone or as a body, especially for your benefit.
01:28:16.46 --> 01:28:25.10 So we're trying to make people think they're elevated to the detached observer, these quaint
01:28:25.10 --> 01:28:33.34 antics may seem ludicrous, boring, or even faintly embarrassing. However, there will be others so
01:28:33.34 --> 01:28:39.82 emotionally incapable of distinguishing between compliments paid to the abstractions of rank
01:28:39.82 --> 01:28:46.22 and commission and those paid to themselves as people that they will actually enjoy these
01:28:46.22 --> 01:28:53.18 gesticulations. This is where the trouble starts. This is when you are going to, you know,
01:28:53.18 --> 01:28:57.02 you're going to OCS or wherever you're getting trained and you start thinking you're damn right,
01:28:57.02 --> 01:29:06.46 you're saluting me. You are saluting me. But such enjoyment of these mandatory conventions based
01:29:06.46 --> 01:29:12.78 upon a highly motivated, if understandable misinterpretation of their meaning may like the effects
01:29:12.78 --> 01:29:18.54 of even the most transparent flattery provoked holy unrealistic feelings of self-importance.
01:29:20.62 --> 01:29:24.38 And you know what's kind of weird? It is kind of weird. In the military,
01:29:25.26 --> 01:29:28.78 one of the big distinctions is you get called, officers get called sir.
01:29:30.30 --> 01:29:34.54 Right? So think about that. You're an officer, you get called sir. It doesn't matter if you're 21
01:29:34.54 --> 01:29:39.82 years old and you just graduated from OCS or you just graduated from the academy. You're getting
01:29:39.82 --> 01:29:44.54 called sir. So there's some people that go, man, you know what? We're really awkward to be called
01:29:44.54 --> 01:29:49.10 sir when I'm actually 22 years old and this guy's 38 years old. That's kind of weird. But I get
01:29:49.10 --> 01:29:54.22 it. It's the military convention. That's a great attitude to have. And you know what? There is
01:29:54.22 --> 01:30:01.58 a level of respect, even when a seasoned non-commissioned officer, a platoon chief calls a young officer,
01:30:01.58 --> 01:30:06.62 sir, he doesn't respect the way and there's a known, it doesn't need to be said.
01:30:06.62 --> 01:30:12.62 Hey, I'm giving you your props. It's good. That's the way the rank structure works and it is like this
01:30:12.62 --> 01:30:19.10 just beautiful relationship. Yeah, but then there's some people that go, yeah, you're damn right?
01:30:19.10 --> 01:30:25.58 You call me sir. Yeah, it's like the like, okay, like the seasoned guy is calling the new guys
01:30:25.58 --> 01:30:29.98 sir or whatever. It's the officer. That's almost like it's respect for the whole
01:30:29.98 --> 01:30:36.86 instant drag. Yes, 100%. Yeah. It's respect for the whole thing and a good young officer goes, man.
01:30:38.38 --> 01:30:42.46 Little bit uncomfortable with what that's the kind of the deal here. I get it and that and so there's also
01:30:43.34 --> 01:30:47.18 there's also endless to guys that go through that phase like who the hell am I calling this guy?
01:30:47.18 --> 01:30:52.38 Sir, that's freaking ridiculous. I'll call you Lieutenant. I'm not calling you sir.
01:30:52.38 --> 01:30:55.98 Sir is for my grandfather. So again, they go through that phase.
01:30:55.98 --> 01:31:01.90 Yeah, young and listed guys will go through that phase of like, I'm not calling this guy. Sir.
01:31:06.06 --> 01:31:11.26 Other significant features of the sand, herst, may-loo according to Ravenr,
01:31:11.90 --> 01:31:16.86 the perfect system where in cadets of higher rank are required to discipline or report upon those of lower
01:31:16.86 --> 01:31:23.66 status. The mind blunting drill square upon which three apparent essentials for a career of violence,
01:31:23.66 --> 01:31:28.46 unthinking obedience and exquisite capacity for keeping in-step and a proper concern for the
01:31:28.46 --> 01:31:35.02 minutia of dress are instilled for our upon our until fatigue and sweat hang over the mast cadets like
01:31:35.02 --> 01:31:41.90 brinstone over sawdom. And finally, the total loss of privacy and lack of leisure for the following
01:31:41.90 --> 01:31:47.50 of idiosyncratic interest and pastimes taken together the features of the royal military academy
01:31:47.50 --> 01:31:54.06 are designed to quote, build character and imbue future officers with values proper to their calling,
01:31:54.06 --> 01:31:59.42 any gaps which sandhurst might leave in a total program for the incocation of an officer like
01:31:59.42 --> 01:32:05.74 quality, our admirably filled up says Ravenr by the quasi morale imperatives of warm minister.
01:32:06.78 --> 01:32:10.94 These cluster around the concepts of guts and enthusiasm, humor,
01:32:10.94 --> 01:32:16.86 sociability and responsibility traits which every officer should show. So they got done with sandhurst
01:32:16.86 --> 01:32:21.98 which is like their military college now. They're their advanced school, this place warm minister,
01:32:21.98 --> 01:32:27.74 and whatever they didn't get it, whatever gaps there are, they're going to go even harder
01:32:27.74 --> 01:32:32.22 at warm minister. While much of the training was inevitably designed to promote physical fitness
01:32:32.22 --> 01:32:36.30 that was nevertheless a strong held belief that an officer, whether fit or not, should always
01:32:36.30 --> 01:32:41.58 have so much in the way of pride or guts that he would never admit to physical inadequacy until
01:32:41.58 --> 01:32:47.50 he dropped dead or unconscious. This belief of very significant one was both mythical, was myth mystical,
01:32:47.50 --> 01:32:52.62 both in nature and intensity. Now we're kind of talking about that, that's kind of a badass thing though.
01:32:52.62 --> 01:32:58.30 Right? It's kind of a badass thing. Hey, you're not going to give up. You're not going to stand
01:32:58.30 --> 01:33:01.18 down. Doesn't matter who you read. You're not. You put on that rock sack. You're going to finish
01:33:01.18 --> 01:33:08.46 this damn march. That's what's happening. This was interesting. Another warm minister virtue
01:33:08.46 --> 01:33:13.02 was a peculiar brand of humor. This was not the ability to see oneself and see one's activities
01:33:13.02 --> 01:33:18.38 into detached and ironical spirit. That would have been fatal. Humor meant being cheerful in the
01:33:18.38 --> 01:33:24.46 face of unpleasant circumstances, rallying the men's spirits by laughing with them over some slapstick
01:33:24.46 --> 01:33:29.50 incident, submitting like a good sport to an unjust punishment given to oneself by the
01:33:29.50 --> 01:33:34.78 agedent and laughing about it afterwards in the mess. This conception of humor and obvious
01:33:34.78 --> 01:33:40.30 branch of guts was in fact a streetly designed to counteract or totally extinguish any tendency
01:33:40.30 --> 01:33:45.58 towards an objective or intellectual humor that might contain tingees of satire or cynicism
01:33:45.58 --> 01:33:51.42 for such a thing would have been detrimental to another highly prized virtue that of enthusiasm.
01:33:51.42 --> 01:33:58.70 So this little brand of humor comes out where there's nothing directed with negativity
01:33:58.70 --> 01:34:06.46 up the chain of command. It's all just funny. I think that's actually, again, maybe I'm this
01:34:06.46 --> 01:34:10.86 the brainwashed dude here, but I think that the guts part is cool. I think that the dark humor
01:34:10.86 --> 01:34:14.38 twisted humor thing is kind of cool too because there's nothing better than getting
01:34:14.38 --> 01:34:19.42 getting in shitty situations than being able to laugh about it. I think that's cool.
01:34:21.10 --> 01:34:28.06 I guess maybe if you take it both these things to this far extreme where we're not protesting
01:34:28.06 --> 01:34:31.34 anything because we're just gonna laugh at it or we're not gonna ever stop because we're just
01:34:31.34 --> 01:34:36.06 gonna keep going even if it's gonna be harmful to us or our troops. Then it turns bad I guess.
01:34:38.06 --> 01:34:43.26 And he's got this word enthusiasm. enthusiasm I can hardly trust myself to speak. It
01:34:43.26 --> 01:34:49.42 seemed to mean a sort of blind uncritical application to any task. However, silly or futile
01:34:49.98 --> 01:34:54.62 that the neurosis or panic of superior might have suddenly thrust upon us. Since one of the
01:34:54.62 --> 01:34:58.62 points of enthusiasm that you started doing whatever it was straight away and without wasting time
01:34:58.62 --> 01:35:02.86 on question enthusiasm could involve a friend and expense of time and energy on some trifling
01:35:02.86 --> 01:35:10.78 project, wastefully because uncritically undertaken abandoned halfway as a rationally was as
01:35:10.78 --> 01:35:16.70 as it was commenced. This of course was just what great soldiers of the past wish to avoid when they
01:35:16.70 --> 01:35:24.70 deplored the indiscriminate use of zeal. Why zeal condemned a like by classmates and Wellington should
01:35:24.70 --> 01:35:29.82 now once again be thought desirable. It is interesting to speculate. So this idea of enthusiasm
01:35:29.82 --> 01:35:36.30 also known as zeal is like hey I'm just on board for whatever you tell me to do. And I guess
01:35:36.30 --> 01:35:41.10 that's another thing. Is it a beautiful thing? In many cases yes it is but if you're getting told
01:35:41.10 --> 01:35:45.74 the charge of machine gunnast and you go Roger that with enthusiasm and zeal and you get all your
01:35:45.74 --> 01:35:50.14 guys killed that's not what we want. That shouldn't be what we want. Maybe the world of what
01:35:50.14 --> 01:35:55.66 one that's what we quote wanted but we shouldn't want that. You should want push back.
01:35:57.34 --> 01:36:01.50 Loyalty meant there's another term loyalty loyalty meant that you were required in the name of the
01:36:01.50 --> 01:36:06.46 queen and honor of the regiment to conceal any impatience or amusement you might feel when the
01:36:06.46 --> 01:36:12.14 demands of your enthusiasm became operatic, first seek, first of all or just plain impossible
01:36:12.14 --> 01:36:18.54 of fulfillment. Loyalty in fact was the conception often blatantly used to blackmail you into silence
01:36:18.54 --> 01:36:22.94 when you were faced with incompetence and justice or sheer fallie of his beard officer. That was kind
01:36:22.94 --> 01:36:27.98 of funny. This is just loyalty. Dude, what's your loyalty? Bro he wants me to listen does make
01:36:27.98 --> 01:36:35.50 me sense bro you need to be more loyal. Right? So she ability was also highly esteemed at warm
01:36:35.50 --> 01:36:42.06 insta. This like loyalty could mean many good things such as hospitality and the desire to please in social
01:36:42.06 --> 01:36:47.82 intercourse but it also implied an unquestioning difference to the convenience and opinions of once
01:36:47.82 --> 01:36:51.42 military superiors. So you're just going to get on board with whatever an else is saying
01:36:52.46 --> 01:36:56.22 and you can see what we're doing. We're creating robots. We're not creating thinking people and this is bad.
01:36:57.90 --> 01:37:02.06 Courage under fire a sort of distilled essence of guts could not exactly be taught so it had to
01:37:02.06 --> 01:37:07.34 be taken for granted and all of us who were tacitly and grimly assumed to possess it. Hence we can
01:37:07.34 --> 01:37:13.42 pass to a very much boosted commodity initiative. So we now we finally go okay cool we want to see
01:37:13.42 --> 01:37:19.02 initiative. Unfortunately in the peacetime conditions even for the most part in wartime ones
01:37:19.02 --> 01:37:24.86 communications are now so good that an opportunity for genuinely individual action so rare that
01:37:24.86 --> 01:37:32.22 initiative tends to become a highly contrived thing artificially fostered to impress superiors. The
01:37:32.22 --> 01:37:35.82 sort of person who is praised at warm insta for initiative generally turned out to be a metal
01:37:35.82 --> 01:37:41.42 symboly of the type who reports to his best friend or to his house master for immoral behavior
01:37:41.42 --> 01:37:50.30 thereby himself becoming head prefect in his friend's place. There you go. So this section he
01:37:50.30 --> 01:37:57.10 gives a bunch of examples of various types of these officers and how they turned out. It seems
01:37:57.10 --> 01:38:02.06 fast forward a little bit. It seems that all remained of his training in the mind of each recipient
01:38:02.06 --> 01:38:09.34 was the faulty syllogism officer should be gentleman. I am an officer therefore I am a gentleman.
01:38:10.70 --> 01:38:17.26 After this he seemed to behave neither as an officer nor as a gentleman in generally any accepted
01:38:17.26 --> 01:38:23.98 sense of these terms. And Raven says this once an officer is established in his own view as a member
01:38:23.98 --> 01:38:31.02 of a superior and order giving classes. Class he never loses this sense. This is where things turn
01:38:31.02 --> 01:38:38.14 into a nightmare. Right so an officer is established in his own view. As a member of a superior and order
01:38:38.14 --> 01:38:46.78 giving class he never loses this sense but he can and often does lose all awareness of the moral
01:38:46.78 --> 01:38:53.02 basis of this superiority and all the qualities which constitute this basis. So he forgets why he's
01:38:53.02 --> 01:38:58.38 in this position. He forgets that he was just like placed here. He starts to believe his own bullshit
01:38:58.38 --> 01:39:02.22 and the bullshit that's been fed to him that people run around calling him so I'm saluting him.
01:39:03.90 --> 01:39:11.34 He just becomes superior as it were in Vaccoa which means in in a vacuum he's in a vacuum he's
01:39:11.34 --> 01:39:19.18 just superior. He becomes a gentleman when this happens one gets that product so typical of the British
01:39:19.18 --> 01:39:24.30 the amateur English officer highly trained professional and professionally and morally he is
01:39:24.30 --> 01:39:31.82 forgotten his professional his professional techniques and sloth off in his sense of moral obligation
01:39:31.82 --> 01:39:40.62 but he retained an unassailable sense of his own superiority and absolute right to give orders.
01:39:40.62 --> 01:39:48.54 And my note next to that was nightmare. That's a nightmare to forget how you ended up in this position
01:39:49.10 --> 01:39:55.42 to forget that you don't know everything to just get told that you're an officer and you're
01:39:55.42 --> 01:39:59.90 superior and you start to believe that this is a nightmare of leadership.
01:39:59.90 --> 01:40:11.74 Now it's things are different the social distance between officers and men more often than
01:40:11.74 --> 01:40:16.78 not contrived rather than rooted in their ancestry. For officers of humble origins this might
01:40:16.78 --> 01:40:22.14 well be expected to produce sizable problems of adjustment. The first jolt to their social reinforcement
01:40:22.14 --> 01:40:28.94 standard will be of one of descriptive discrepancies. What's interesting about this is there's no guarantee
01:40:29.90 --> 01:40:36.30 like I knew officers that came silver spoon all day long and they were just down to earth good people
01:40:37.50 --> 01:40:43.26 and I also knew silver spoon officers that thought that they deserved they thought that they were
01:40:43.26 --> 01:40:48.86 superior. I also knew some guys from lower class that scrambled through and scraped through and
01:40:48.86 --> 01:40:54.70 became officers and they were awesome and they never forgot where they came from and I also knew
01:40:54.70 --> 01:40:58.78 officers that had come up through the ranks and they were turds.
01:41:00.70 --> 01:41:06.14 Lave points out that the best officer that went through his junior officer training
01:41:07.50 --> 01:41:13.34 was a prior-and-listen officer and the worst officer that went through his junior officer training was a
01:41:13.34 --> 01:41:19.02 prior-listen officer which is crazy to think. That's crazy to think. I think that I agree with that.
01:41:19.82 --> 01:41:25.58 Your description those four categories whatever you want to call them. Same thing. Same the exact same thing.
01:41:26.14 --> 01:41:30.62 And I'm trying to remember the way you were describing it is I remember I guess I don't remember
01:41:30.62 --> 01:41:36.46 like the first time it happened but there's like a ceremony. Do you have a first salute ceremony?
01:41:36.46 --> 01:41:44.14 Yep. And I remember that being an incredibly uncomfortable experience for me. Like man this is weird.
01:41:44.14 --> 01:41:48.14 The guy who I did it was a good friend of mine who's a listed marine he had fought in desert storm.
01:41:48.54 --> 01:41:56.94 He was a known well-known guy and just by virtue of accomplishing the criteria to make me an
01:41:56.94 --> 01:42:03.90 officer like from one moment to the next he saluted me. And I think I was just lucky to have that sense
01:42:03.90 --> 01:42:09.42 like man this is weird. You know but also I think you described it well like the reverence for
01:42:09.42 --> 01:42:13.26 the institution like this is how the institution is designed and if you have that reverence for it
01:42:13.26 --> 01:42:17.82 he didn't feel the mean and I didn't feel superior and yet that's the way it's supposed to be.
01:42:17.82 --> 01:42:25.42 Yeah and yet how easily like oh I could get used to this. You know how quickly people fall to that trap
01:42:25.42 --> 01:42:30.54 of all into that trap and it's not the and it's not the institution that bestowed this on me.
01:42:30.54 --> 01:42:37.18 Yeah I was your is there yes. Yeah I mean and this again we're talking about the military
01:42:37.18 --> 01:42:42.22 specifically but you can apply this anywhere you can apply this anywhere oh well I you know I went to
01:42:42.22 --> 01:42:48.62 this college I went through this program I got my MBA from here or there and all of a sudden it's like oh
01:42:50.22 --> 01:42:54.94 did I tell you that? Did I mention where I went to college you know it's like
01:42:54.94 --> 01:43:00.94 hmm yeah that's cool man appreciate it that's awesome. Yeah but when you say nobody notices it.
01:43:06.06 --> 01:43:12.38 There's a there's a note about this Raven's assessment so somebody kind of read that big
01:43:12.38 --> 01:43:18.62 assessment of San Hirsten and this guy says I read Simon Ravens paper with great interest when
01:43:18.62 --> 01:43:25.90 you when you ask from my comments you must bear in mind that in 1898 when I was gazetted I joined a
01:43:25.90 --> 01:43:32.14 totally different type of army from that of today it was an aristocratic army feudal in the
01:43:32.14 --> 01:43:37.34 sense that it was grounded on leadership and fall and fellowship in which with few exceptions the
01:43:37.34 --> 01:43:43.98 leaders were the sons of gentlemen and more frequently than not the eldest sons the most privileged sons
01:43:43.98 --> 01:43:51.02 when I went to San Hirst we were not taught to behave like gentlemen because it never occurred to
01:43:51.02 --> 01:43:56.54 anyone that we should behave otherwise we were taught a lot of obsolete tactics in every army the
01:43:56.54 --> 01:44:01.66 of that day did a tremendous lot of useless drill but never heard a word about responsibility,
01:44:01.66 --> 01:44:07.74 loyalty, guts, et cetera because so I suppose these were held to be the natural prerequisites of
01:44:07.74 --> 01:44:12.70 gentlemen so this is back in the day when it's like hey man you better act like this you you're
01:44:12.70 --> 01:44:20.94 upholding the family named the men the followers of that period were a rough lot simple tough
01:44:20.94 --> 01:44:26.86 alliterate largely recruited from down melts men who had a lot met who met who had gotten a lot of
01:44:26.86 --> 01:44:32.30 trouble vagabonds and a sprinkling of the grand sons and grandsons sons of nCOs and private soldiers
01:44:32.30 --> 01:44:37.66 military families who generally became nCOs they were therefore two distinct classes really
01:44:37.66 --> 01:44:43.74 cast by birth on the whole the men looked up to their officers whether they were a fission or
01:44:43.74 --> 01:44:50.14 insufficient or inefficient and the officers did not look down on their men why should they so he was
01:44:50.14 --> 01:44:57.02 saying like this was just kind of the way it was back then the idea of an officer imposing on his
01:44:57.66 --> 01:45:04.46 imposing his will on his men never entered his head because one class was so superior and the other
01:45:04.46 --> 01:45:10.38 so inferior that it was unnecessary to do this there wasn't even any opposing ideas to what you were saying
01:45:11.66 --> 01:45:18.78 the superior could not lose cast should he play or mix with his men I remember this is a good story
01:45:18.78 --> 01:45:25.90 I remember on my first tour as an orderly officer on the QMS was late for the QMS mean the
01:45:25.90 --> 01:45:31.98 quartermaster so one of the sailors was late for meat issue and I thought he had risked it because
01:45:31.98 --> 01:45:39.34 I was a novice so I put him under arrest when this was reported to the agitant he took me aside and
01:45:39.34 --> 01:45:45.02 said strictly speaking you were right but actually speaking you weren't ass so don't do it again
01:45:45.02 --> 01:45:48.94 and I didn't so he like punished this guy trying to prove that he was pretty said hey bro what are you
01:45:48.94 --> 01:45:53.74 knowing you you technically you could do that but that's not the way you treat your people
01:45:57.02 --> 01:45:59.66 of the present day democratic army I know next to nothing
01:45:59.66 --> 01:46:05.26 like the older aristocratic one it must have its good points and is probably more efficient but
01:46:05.26 --> 01:46:10.54 to me it is a folly to try and mix the two a gentleman is born and not made it is probably true
01:46:10.54 --> 01:46:16.22 that it takes three generations to fashion one and so it would appear for Mr. Ravens experiences if you
01:46:16.22 --> 01:46:23.82 try and make them synthetically you get neither an aristocrat or a democracy one sees this everywhere
01:46:23.82 --> 01:46:29.02 today among the rich the poor on the roads and in the factories I repeat it again gentleman
01:46:29.02 --> 01:46:34.78 are not turned out like sausages they are turned they are men of ingrained honor of principle
01:46:34.78 --> 01:46:41.10 and of decent behavior and some of the finest I have met in my long life had the long to the
01:46:41.10 --> 01:46:47.58 humblest classes because this cast rather than class is becoming extinct in my home
01:46:47.58 --> 01:46:55.02 opinion one of the great factors at the bottom of the present world turmoil and that's from JFC
01:46:55.02 --> 01:47:01.42 follower and he's another guy that was sort of in league with l'Adel Hart lots of great ideas
01:47:02.94 --> 01:47:06.86 fought north Africa or far north war war or sorry in South Africa far world war one
01:47:06.86 --> 01:47:11.58 who the Nazis took a bunch of his ideas and ran with them by the way even though he's a Brit
01:47:12.62 --> 01:47:17.74 so it's just a different I I wonder we that park is it's just a different world this is the
01:47:17.74 --> 01:47:25.82 different situation and they court sort of had this pre-existing system that was in place now what
01:47:25.82 --> 01:47:31.82 kind of makes me disturbed about this is you know he's he's basically talking about how great
01:47:31.82 --> 01:47:36.06 the gentleman were of the day but these were the gentleman that freaking acted like idiots
01:47:36.06 --> 01:47:42.46 leading their troops to be killed so there wasn't so much honor and principle as he's talking
01:47:42.46 --> 01:47:49.10 about close now this section he says from a general study of leadership it seems
01:47:49.98 --> 01:47:54.70 there is much in military organizations to invite incompetence officers are selected for the wrong
01:47:54.70 --> 01:48:01.98 reasons required to fulfill in compatible roles and expected to function adequately in a communication
01:48:01.98 --> 01:48:08.70 system of dubious efficiency at higher levels of command they are protected from adverse criticism
01:48:08.70 --> 01:48:15.10 by their invisibility and by the plain fact that in times of stress even the poorest leaders like
01:48:15.10 --> 01:48:20.30 drunken fathers and rabbits feet are clung to with pathetic if misplaced dependency
01:48:22.22 --> 01:48:26.62 yeah the invisibility part he mentioned that and was talking about the fact that
01:48:28.30 --> 01:48:32.46 a lot of these senior leaders they just no one would see him you wouldn't see him on the front lines
01:48:32.46 --> 01:48:35.26 so they weren't getting criticism because they were they weren't around to be criticized
01:48:35.26 --> 01:48:41.90 mm-hmm military achievement besides providing legitimate outlets for aggression
01:48:42.70 --> 01:48:49.10 the gratification of obsessive tendencies and reassurances about virtual reality armies and
01:48:49.10 --> 01:48:57.10 navies also cater for another basic human motive the need to achieve they do this in several ways
01:48:57.10 --> 01:49:01.66 they embody related hierarchies of rank money and class so there's another thing that you can get
01:49:01.66 --> 01:49:05.50 by joining the military if you're a person that's driven to succeed you go in the military and you can get
01:49:05.50 --> 01:49:13.50 like a formatted way to move up the chain of command. Second they accentuate the challenge
01:49:13.50 --> 01:49:19.50 of promotional ladder by making certain upward movements very difficult indeed third the ethos of
01:49:19.50 --> 01:49:25.02 the armed forces is such that such as to make advancement lovable and highly rewarding generals
01:49:25.02 --> 01:49:30.78 have every advantage bar that of age over those lower down on the ladder they are richer,
01:49:30.78 --> 01:49:35.26 safer and more comfortable their chances of collecting honors orders and nighthooks are
01:49:35.26 --> 01:49:41.42 imminently greater than those of more junior ranks finally even the most modest thirst for
01:49:41.42 --> 01:49:47.34 achievement is encouraged by training and convention the taboo on junior speaking to senior seniors
01:49:47.34 --> 01:49:52.94 in officer training establishments saluting and being saluted orders of march rules as to say
01:49:53.50 --> 01:49:59.42 as who says sir to whom all serve to emphasize the horizontal stratifications of military
01:49:59.42 --> 01:50:08.06 organizations besides adding lustre to each new level gained so that's what the military sets up this
01:50:08.06 --> 01:50:11.98 really nice place where you can kind of you see what the game is and if you don't want to play
01:50:11.98 --> 01:50:17.10 the game you're going to get you're going to get satisfaction unfortunately there are aspects
01:50:17.10 --> 01:50:21.18 of military career which are unlikely to attract people with high achievement motivation
01:50:22.38 --> 01:50:26.38 and he says this at first sight these arguments would seem to suggest that the possibility
01:50:26.38 --> 01:50:30.06 of promotion in the military organization would attract those with a potential for achievement
01:50:30.06 --> 01:50:35.82 go getters entrepreneurs innovators and men with energy and drive in short people who would make
01:50:35.82 --> 01:50:39.18 first class military commanders right so you think oh cool this is like a hierarchy set up that
01:50:39.18 --> 01:50:42.22 make sense I'm down I want to go in there because I'm an entrepreneur I'm a go getter
01:50:43.10 --> 01:50:48.62 sometimes it does in the case of wellington Montgomery rommel and zukov men with in order
01:50:48.62 --> 01:50:51.58 to lead strong needs for achievement all those guys wanted to do well
01:50:51.58 --> 01:50:57.42 unfortunately however there are aspects of a military career which are unlikely to attract
01:50:57.42 --> 01:51:02.06 people with high achievement motivation the fact that traditionally promotion depends upon
01:51:02.06 --> 01:51:08.54 seniority class wealth conformity and obedience may well leave them rather cold neither means
01:51:08.54 --> 01:51:12.86 nor the ends are sufficiently attractive so when you get a guy like Wellington like rommel
01:51:13.50 --> 01:51:18.14 they look and say okay how do I need to get promoted oh I've got a conform I've got to be a
01:51:18.14 --> 01:51:24.06 yes man so all their entrepreneurial spirit is thrown out the window they don't they they're
01:51:24.06 --> 01:51:29.82 being forced to comply in order to get promoted so it doesn't really seem as attractive as they
01:51:29.82 --> 01:51:36.86 thought originally was going to be moral for military types military has never smiled upon
01:51:36.86 --> 01:51:41.82 entrepreneurs and innovators the cut and thrust of private enterprise cleverness and even working
01:51:41.82 --> 01:51:49.66 too hard have not been deemed good form there is however another class of person for whom the military
01:51:49.66 --> 01:51:55.58 might well be an attractive proposition these are people who achievement motivation is pathological
01:51:55.58 --> 01:52:02.38 in origin the crucial difference between the two sorts of achievement the healthy and the pathological
01:52:02.38 --> 01:52:09.58 may be summarized by saying that whereas the first is buoyed up by hopes of success the second
01:52:09.58 --> 01:52:15.02 is driven by fear of failure. One person that wants to do a good job and one's person that
01:52:15.02 --> 01:52:21.50 just scared to fail whereas the former achieves out of a quest of excellence in his job the latter
01:52:21.50 --> 01:52:27.18 achieves by any means available not necessarily because of any sincere devotion to the work
01:52:27.18 --> 01:52:32.70 but because of the status social promotion or social approval and reduction of doubts about the
01:52:32.70 --> 01:52:37.90 self that's such achievement brings applying these distinctions to the military would seem that
01:52:37.90 --> 01:52:44.22 senior commanders fall into two groups and I think this is actually pretty accurate those primarily
01:52:44.22 --> 01:52:50.46 concerned with improving their professional ability and those primarily concerned with self-betterment
01:52:54.30 --> 01:52:58.62 a fast forward a little bit research suggests that these two sorts of achievement motivation
01:52:58.62 --> 01:53:04.94 go along with certain other personality traits thus need achievement motivation towards
01:53:04.94 --> 01:53:09.98 professional excellence is accompanied by greater occupational and intellectual competence so this is
01:53:09.98 --> 01:53:13.74 a person that wants to get promoted for the right reasons greater occupational and intellectual
01:53:13.74 --> 01:53:18.70 competence that's what he wants a better memory for uncomplete a task and therefore a predisposition
01:53:18.70 --> 01:53:24.30 to finish something once the gun a preference when choosing working partners for successful strangers
01:53:24.30 --> 01:53:29.10 rather than unsuccessful friends that's one just the you crappy leaders always surround themselves with
01:53:29.10 --> 01:53:35.98 their crappy unsuccessful friends a great greater readiness to volunteer for psychological experiments
01:53:35.98 --> 01:53:43.50 greater activity in the institution or community of which they are a member so this is I think
01:53:43.50 --> 01:53:46.30 it's just important remember that there's some people that are out there for themselves
01:53:48.14 --> 01:53:51.66 and there's some people that are out there to try and do a good job he says compare
01:53:51.66 --> 01:53:56.30 Lawrence and this is Lawrence of Arabia compare Lawrence roughing it with his tiny Arab force
01:53:56.30 --> 01:54:03.98 on the 800 mile trek across the desert to west to to rest akaba from the Turks with towns and
01:54:05.02 --> 01:54:11.02 comfortably a sconce and his villa on the sea of mormara while his captured troops died in their
01:54:11.02 --> 01:54:16.94 thousands from exposure malnutrition and brutality the contrast in both cases in between the
01:54:16.94 --> 01:54:23.74 self imposed as sadism of high achievement motivation and the self indulgence of one concerned with
01:54:23.74 --> 01:54:28.86 professional excellence less concerned with professional excellence than with personal advantage
01:54:30.06 --> 01:54:36.78 pretty good stark difference between those two how is it that some of the criteria for
01:54:36.78 --> 01:54:42.14 promotion to military organizations are evidently such as to favor people with a pathological
01:54:42.14 --> 01:54:47.26 degree of achievement motivation this is scary the person that might have a tendency to get promoted
01:54:47.26 --> 01:54:52.06 is the one that's looking out for themselves in some cases in the military again isn't
01:54:52.06 --> 01:54:58.06 important to say this isn't like the entire military but certainly I certainly saw people in the military
01:54:58.06 --> 01:55:03.34 that were 100% looking out for themselves and they got promoted yeah that does happen yep there's
01:55:03.34 --> 01:55:10.14 no doubt about it it it happens less than you would think a lot of times that transparency that these
01:55:10.14 --> 01:55:14.14 idiots would have looking out for themselves and trying to make those maneuvers everyone would see
01:55:14.14 --> 01:55:21.50 it maybe I know you're not getting promoted but it did happen there are grounds for thinking that
01:55:21.50 --> 01:55:27.82 incompetent commanders tend to be those whom the need to avoid failure exceeds the urge to succeed
01:55:29.58 --> 01:55:36.22 according to JWAK and T-feather such people tend to issue activities which they may show up in a
01:55:36.22 --> 01:55:42.46 poor light and unless forced to so refrain from taking on any skilled task where there are any doubts
01:55:42.46 --> 01:55:47.58 about the outcome so people that are just concerned about themselves they'll only go into jobs where
01:55:47.58 --> 01:55:52.46 they know they're going to win that's what they're trying to do they're just they're only doing
01:55:52.46 --> 01:55:56.78 jobs of things that they know they're going to do if no one's going to win that here in lies
01:55:56.78 --> 01:56:03.74 especially lemma though they need to achieve it is the very nature of trying which exposes them to
01:56:03.74 --> 01:56:09.98 that which they fear most failure they are like people who try to climb mountains out of an
01:56:09.98 --> 01:56:15.58 underlying fear of heights it would not be surprising to find that such people are attracted to
01:56:15.58 --> 01:56:22.22 and prosper in the armed services for one place it carefully in the military and contrast the
01:56:22.22 --> 01:56:27.98 world of commerce offers achievement without tears stick to the rule book do nothing while
01:56:27.98 --> 01:56:34.14 explicit approval from the next higher up always confirm form never offend your superiors
01:56:34.14 --> 01:56:39.90 and you will float serenely if a trifle slowly upward a blip in both senses of the word
01:56:39.90 --> 01:56:49.10 that's the reality you can you there you can do that you can join the military and you can just
01:56:49.10 --> 01:56:55.50 kind of keep your nose clean stay low profile don't take any additional risks conform
01:56:55.50 --> 01:56:59.34 and you will get promoted over time in many cases Marine Corps tighter though I think
01:57:00.94 --> 01:57:03.98 I'd like to think that I mean you just described what you're describing I can I'm
01:57:03.98 --> 01:57:11.02 he's right yeah and I've seen it and not not right on the blanket statement no no no no it certainly happens
01:57:11.02 --> 01:57:17.34 yes yeah no correct and and you're right in saying like that's part of the system is is you have
01:57:17.34 --> 01:57:21.34 you might show for this altruism of how it works and the wrong people get promoted sometimes
01:57:21.34 --> 01:57:25.34 now it's not a lot of those people's actually a small number like you said but it happens enough
01:57:25.34 --> 01:57:29.66 that you will see it you're not going to go a career and go oh I never saw that every single time
01:57:29.66 --> 01:57:33.74 it was the right person of the right reasons no throughout my career there was examples that I
01:57:33.74 --> 01:57:39.50 can reflect back on it's a small number but the system doesn't work perfectly and I think the
01:57:39.50 --> 01:57:43.98 thing I was thinking about and this is military I think in general there are enough jobs in the
01:57:43.98 --> 01:57:49.66 military that have been done enough times that the template is there that you know I can take those
01:57:49.66 --> 01:57:55.74 set orders and like man it's really low risk you know cookie cutter job that's been done
01:57:55.74 --> 01:58:00.54 I can take the template jocos going off to me here's the you know here's the script follow the
01:58:00.54 --> 01:58:06.54 script low profile low risk you're going to look good in the end and you're going to get promoted there
01:58:06.54 --> 01:58:12.94 there are those jobs out there I was lucky in my career to have jobs that either I've never been
01:58:12.94 --> 01:58:18.22 done before or really that it wasn't a lot of history behind them so you know I'm remembering
01:58:18.22 --> 01:58:23.02 a couple times like when I was in command of an organization where you know I was being told hey
01:58:24.22 --> 01:58:29.26 if this fails it's going to destroy the whole thing like oh that's okay that's awesome I think I've
01:58:29.26 --> 01:58:33.82 told the story before I'm far enough away from it now that I can I can tell it if I haven't before
01:58:33.82 --> 01:58:39.42 but when I took over the first F 35 squadron the Marine Corps Z-35 program was on probation
01:58:39.98 --> 01:58:44.06 like they were contemplating canceling the F-35 for the Marine Corps the B variant which was the Marine
01:58:44.06 --> 01:58:48.30 Corps variant and the Marine Corps had already long since committed to that was the only platform
01:58:48.30 --> 01:58:52.62 there was no plan B there was no alternative to that so if we were going to lose the F-35 B the
01:58:52.62 --> 01:58:59.42 Marine Corps was going to lose tack air and as soon as I took command and you know I stood up
01:58:59.42 --> 01:59:01.90 I told you there's a guy there before no airplanes but when I took command they were playing
01:59:01.90 --> 01:59:04.78 started to arrive right when I got there the comment on the Marine Corps came down
01:59:06.86 --> 01:59:10.62 spent like an hour with me they met him at the squadron it was he and a sergeant major and me and
01:59:10.62 --> 01:59:14.46 my sergeant major and he goes hey I hate to tell you this but you can't crash in airplane
01:59:15.74 --> 01:59:17.34 like wow that's
01:59:17.34 --> 01:59:22.38 Roger that Roger that you know what I mean like if you crash in airplane
01:59:22.38 --> 01:59:26.14 we're going to lose the program we're in going to lose that air and so you're talking about
01:59:26.14 --> 01:59:32.06 the the balance of the risk of losing is a lot you know the balance that between the benefit
01:59:32.06 --> 01:59:36.54 of winning well yeah I'll just you know margin benefit of winning but like there's zero risk
01:59:36.54 --> 01:59:40.78 or you know the flip side is hey if I go two years of squadron commander everything goes great
01:59:40.78 --> 01:59:44.54 I'm going to get a firm handshake and I congratulations and life's going to go on but nobody's
01:59:44.54 --> 01:59:48.86 going to credit me for doing anything remarkable because the system is the the program is just
01:59:48.86 --> 01:59:53.98 moving along where it where it needs to go but if I screwed up you know that downside risk and
01:59:53.98 --> 01:59:59.26 and I understand the the aversion to that like hey would rather have a guaranteed win with you
01:59:59.26 --> 02:00:07.02 know a guaranteed marginal win with no chance of losing or high risk of failure but this is a
02:00:07.02 --> 02:00:10.54 once in a lifetime thing that would need the right person the right time to go through that a lot
02:00:10.54 --> 02:00:14.54 of people are averse to that yep well and this is the other scary thing about that is
02:00:15.18 --> 02:00:19.34 so you're the squadron commander you get told don't crash any birds well
02:00:20.46 --> 02:00:25.58 how but we fly a little less right it's interesting to said that because in the exact same weekend
02:00:26.30 --> 02:00:31.98 the deputy common on for aviation the head aviator the Marine Corps said your number one job
02:00:31.98 --> 02:00:37.66 is to fly as much as you can possibly possible day Roger that okay and listen there's a part of
02:00:37.66 --> 02:00:42.94 it too that any you have to understand it's like there is nothing that I could do personally short
02:00:42.94 --> 02:00:47.50 of shutting down the squadron right to guarantee the one kind of there's nothing I can do that so
02:00:48.54 --> 02:00:53.02 there's a part of that like if you can just let that go is recognized my best chance of me being
02:00:53.02 --> 02:00:57.50 successful is to my commander is none of this yeah as opposed to try to make her manage all of it
02:00:57.50 --> 02:01:00.46 you know and that's such a good point because
02:01:00.46 --> 02:01:07.90 okay we can either fly as little as humanly possible which means everyone's paranoid no one really
02:01:07.90 --> 02:01:11.42 knows how to do job really like all right we're gonna fly these things we'll be awesome at it and that's
02:01:11.42 --> 02:01:17.10 the right call obviously not everyone would make that decision and even then they're still even
02:01:17.10 --> 02:01:21.90 the right call doesn't guarantee the outcome you go to everything right and you know what yeah you have
02:01:21.90 --> 02:01:27.90 a miss hop on me those things break yeah things break and mid flight yep that happens they do
02:01:27.90 --> 02:01:31.34 especially brand new airplanes just they're being designed while you're flying them those things happen
02:01:32.30 --> 02:01:41.26 how many f 35s have crashed not a lot so I believe I have to go back and look I think the first one
02:01:41.26 --> 02:01:50.30 crashed and my squadron like six months after I left yeah got out of the we've there's been a very small
02:01:50.94 --> 02:01:57.66 it's been a very safe airplane what is enough 35 cost at the time it was 130 million now
02:01:57.66 --> 02:02:02.94 it's probably 90 also they cut the price down well those first ones are like you know they were literally
02:02:02.94 --> 02:02:08.06 the very first ones off the assembly and so that that as you know like that mass production
02:02:08.62 --> 02:02:13.10 benefit hadn't continued so age one was kind of like a unique article now like their jammer
02:02:13.10 --> 02:02:16.70 amount they're making a bunch of them and and it's it's more cost effective I know these are crazy
02:02:16.70 --> 02:02:23.74 numbers but at the time they were they were expensive 133 a copy I had 14 and if you
02:02:23.74 --> 02:02:29.10 when you find an f 35 and you're doing a vertical how often did you a vertical take off
02:02:31.10 --> 02:02:36.30 like a short take off like the stole like the yeah like yeah like a hair year yeah
02:02:36.30 --> 02:02:41.66 not that often sometimes it's how much gas do you go through taking one of those things off vertically
02:02:42.70 --> 02:02:46.70 the vertical flying burns a ridiculous amount of gas do you just basically have to refuel us
02:02:46.70 --> 02:02:53.10 as soon as you get up it's not that bad but it's it's a lot of gas yeah the the landings are more
02:02:53.10 --> 02:02:56.94 of a critical because you're on the clock like you come in you gotta be relatively light you can't
02:02:56.94 --> 02:03:00.70 land like a fully loaded airplane vertically because it's too heavy okay so you gotta be like
02:03:00.70 --> 02:03:06.30 a certain limited amount of gas so the plane is light enough to hover but then again like you can't
02:03:06.30 --> 02:03:10.30 just sit there all day long because you don't have that much gas it's nothing like the
02:03:10.30 --> 02:03:15.74 hair year was those guys it was sketchy like really really sketchy but yeah you're burning a lot
02:03:15.74 --> 02:03:21.98 of gas a lot it was sketchy in a hair year what made it more sketchy less powerful airplane
02:03:21.98 --> 02:03:27.02 harder to fly less margin for air less you need less gas to be able to land and didn't have as
02:03:27.02 --> 02:03:34.62 much time you know just I figured I flew the hair year simulator out at Yuma yeah did I crash that they
02:03:34.62 --> 02:03:39.02 literally 17 tons of row I my total flight time was nine seconds just hope that I just
02:03:39.02 --> 02:03:43.10 cry out if you got to know enough 35 right now in the simulator I could over the shoulder you walk
02:03:43.10 --> 02:03:48.06 you through to you landed almost perfectly in the first drawing well that's like drones
02:03:48.06 --> 02:03:53.02 man those first drones came out that were like little model airplanes guys were just crashing
02:03:53.02 --> 02:03:59.74 everywhere and now a three year old confide drone and that's that's no such technology
02:03:59.74 --> 02:04:07.74 uh this thing says on the same note the net result would be a bi-modal distribution of officers
02:04:07.74 --> 02:04:10.94 at every grade so these two different types of officers you end up with them at every grade
02:04:11.58 --> 02:04:15.34 those who take risks and get away with it the Montgomerys and Lawrence is up this
02:04:15.34 --> 02:04:20.46 of this world and those who have plotted up the hard but safe way the good old boys you never
02:04:20.46 --> 02:04:26.06 speak out a turn who make up intact and conformity what they lack in enterprise and initiative
02:04:27.82 --> 02:04:36.14 interesting contemplation of a nept commander suggests that they were of the latter genre
02:04:36.14 --> 02:04:40.78 in the first place they were renowned almost without exception for being hypersensitive to
02:04:40.78 --> 02:04:46.06 criticism so those people that are the the the conformists high-percentive
02:04:47.26 --> 02:04:50.70 asked the question of physical bravery and no way to track from the feats of courage
02:04:50.70 --> 02:04:56.22 to note that the fear of being afraid the fear of social disemprovele for cowardice and most
02:04:56.22 --> 02:05:00.38 important the personal shame attendant upon flinching in the face of danger could drive a man
02:05:00.38 --> 02:05:05.42 to perform acts of valor far beyond the normal call of duty this is not to deny that bravery occurs
02:05:05.42 --> 02:05:12.70 for other reasons out of pure altruism or patriotism but merely that some individuals are so
02:05:12.70 --> 02:05:16.78 lacking in self-esteem that they will gladly exchange the fear of failure for their own physical
02:05:16.78 --> 02:05:22.62 destruction that's kind of a weird thing to say in a very real sense military organizations
02:05:22.62 --> 02:05:28.54 recognize and trade upon this fact of human nature death rather than dishonor is no empty
02:05:28.54 --> 02:05:38.14 platitude but formulates an essential and ancient feature of military i'll tell you what's a
02:05:38.14 --> 02:05:42.22 you would expand a little bit more which he doesn't what's scary about that is when people are
02:05:43.26 --> 02:05:49.42 being brave with other people's lives that that's what's jacked up look if you're brave
02:05:49.42 --> 02:05:53.90 and you go and do something heroic good on you i don't care what your motivation was i think
02:05:53.90 --> 02:05:59.66 same harris always talks about the fact that you can't you can't fake bravery right you run out
02:05:59.66 --> 02:06:04.54 in the street there's no fake in it you did it and that's that it doesn't matter if you
02:06:04.54 --> 02:06:09.66 thought it you were did it because you were going to be ashamed or you did it because you were just
02:06:09.66 --> 02:06:14.06 a hyper motivated or whatever it doesn't matter you can't fake it you were brave no no no no
02:06:14.06 --> 02:06:18.54 no question about it but when you start being brave with other people's lives that's a freaking
02:06:18.54 --> 02:06:23.74 disaster that's what these horrible leaders end up doing it cannot be emphasized too strong
02:06:23.74 --> 02:06:27.74 only that this suggested relationship between valor and the need to prove oneself a no way
02:06:27.74 --> 02:06:33.10 to base his bravery on the contrary takes the view that the best measure of courage is the
02:06:33.10 --> 02:06:39.34 fear that is overcome then these were the bravest of them all for his only by conquering
02:06:39.34 --> 02:06:44.86 rational fear that they could nullify fear of being afraid so there you go the tragedy of this
02:06:44.86 --> 02:06:50.62 issue is that if military organizations select their senior commanders for their physical
02:06:50.62 --> 02:06:56.14 as opposed to moral bravery they not only might ignore other equally important attributes
02:06:56.14 --> 02:07:01.66 but are bound to select a proportion of individuals whose underlying psychopathology is quite
02:07:01.66 --> 02:07:07.66 unfitted to positions of high command in this way they invite incompetence so just because someone's
02:07:07.66 --> 02:07:11.50 brave doesn't mean you want to put them in a leadership position doesn't say you don't want them
02:07:11.50 --> 02:07:17.26 there and there is certainly a huge benefit to someone that's been in combat and knows what's
02:07:17.26 --> 02:07:23.18 happening knows the understands the emotions and and the human nature that takes place on the front
02:07:23.18 --> 02:07:27.66 lines for sure that's highly beneficial shouldn't be the only reason you select somebody though
02:07:31.42 --> 02:07:37.34 the last trait of those who harbour a fear of failure concerns the selection of subordinates
02:07:38.14 --> 02:07:42.46 they're really two components to this process the first concerns the way an individual sees
02:07:42.46 --> 02:07:46.38 himself in comparison with his competitors in the second the way he thinks others will see him
02:07:46.38 --> 02:07:53.26 in comparison with his contemporaries in either case he may well try to elevate his own self
02:07:53.26 --> 02:08:00.70 estimation by choosing a low standard with which to make comparison hence the phenomenon of people
02:08:00.70 --> 02:08:07.50 who tend to shun the company of individuals more gifted and even choose workmates as select or select
02:08:07.50 --> 02:08:14.78 as subordinates people who may consider inferior to themselves a lot of freaking disaster that is
02:08:14.78 --> 02:08:20.78 so that's the person that wants to look good so hires a bunch of idiots talks a little bit
02:08:20.78 --> 02:08:25.42 about haig he talks about haig being painfully aware of his limitations haig was a world war
02:08:25.42 --> 02:08:32.22 one commander of burnish troops and then try to enter the one profession open to the dumps of the
02:08:32.22 --> 02:08:37.90 family of the army only to find that even nary failed to shine he got put into his position the
02:08:37.90 --> 02:08:44.62 reason he got promoted is because he got sort of a hook up from a family member his elder sister
02:08:44.62 --> 02:08:50.06 hen rea to new the Duke of Cambridge hooked him up with ventured entry to staff college then he was the
02:08:50.06 --> 02:08:58.78 aid to camp to the king do this guy's just making moves make and moves became respected for his
02:08:58.78 --> 02:09:05.34 conventional opinions that's crazy right you've become respected because you agree with everybody
02:09:05.34 --> 02:09:13.82 that's a great point king that's a hundred percent right king he said things like cavalry will have
02:09:13.82 --> 02:09:20.38 a larger sphere of action future wars artillery only seems to be really effective against raw
02:09:20.38 --> 02:09:29.34 troops these are just idiotic statements he also had a he was also prone to a steady
02:09:29.34 --> 02:09:34.86 denigration of his competitors and the removal of his superior care of superior commanders this
02:09:34.86 --> 02:09:41.02 guy was just a shit talker haig haig talent for finding fault with everybody but himself
02:09:41.02 --> 02:09:47.10 was particularly keen whenever results had resulted in military setback and he gives all these just
02:09:47.90 --> 02:09:55.98 crazy examples uh he put he blamed someone he's unfit to command a division at this critical
02:09:55.98 --> 02:09:59.18 purity of the operations in France and should only be employed at home by the way there's a
02:09:59.18 --> 02:10:05.82 people that are working for him by the way ralson is unsatisfactory loyalty to his subordinates
02:10:05.82 --> 02:10:11.26 but he has many other valuable qualities he's trying to get rid of somebody he's like guys he's
02:10:11.26 --> 02:10:17.82 as valuable qualities but he's overly loyalty to his troops seems impossible to discuss the military
02:10:17.82 --> 02:10:23.34 problems with and with an un-reasoning brain to his kind the fact is that surge on seems
02:10:23.34 --> 02:10:28.14 uncapable realizing the nature of the fighting that has been going on in the difficulties of
02:10:28.14 --> 02:10:32.62 getting fresh troops and stores forward an adequate communication trenches dug on Saturday
02:10:32.62 --> 02:10:38.14 October 19 made an impromptu report to oh this is uh on Saturday october 4th
02:10:38.14 --> 02:10:44.86 19th haig this guy makes this report up his chain of command about the his commander
02:10:45.74 --> 02:10:50.62 surge on French what happens eventually French gets fired who gets put in charge haig
02:10:56.46 --> 02:11:01.66 haig got his wish reaching the pinnacle of the greatest army that the empire had ever put in the
02:11:01.66 --> 02:11:07.90 field in the past or was ever to amass in the future a body whose heroism and devotion was
02:11:07.90 --> 02:11:13.98 such that they could twice in two successive years be ravaged in hopeless offensive who were in
02:11:13.98 --> 02:11:21.02 a single day to lose more men than any other army in the history of the world whom after 27
02:11:21.02 --> 02:11:28.22 months of slaughter and exhaustion he was to leave so periously exposed that they were nearly annihilated
02:11:28.22 --> 02:11:38.06 just horrible and this uh section that will close out with for today
02:11:39.82 --> 02:11:48.46 says freedom of expression and cognitive process unfettered by inhibitions were not looked upon
02:11:48.46 --> 02:11:57.98 with favor in military personnel so that's a horrible situation it seems then that
02:11:57.98 --> 02:12:05.42 in the case of achievement motivation as with obsessive tendency military organizations attract
02:12:05.42 --> 02:12:12.06 and then reinforce those very characteristics which will prove and the theoretical
02:12:12.06 --> 02:12:21.18 to competent military performance it's uh again is that true in the military yes it is
02:12:21.18 --> 02:12:25.02 is it true in the civil or let me rephrase that I saw you're looking your face to have
02:12:25.02 --> 02:12:29.90 can it be true in the military yes it can can it attract people with these type of tendencies yes it
02:12:29.90 --> 02:12:35.98 can can it then provide opportunities for people to sort of just get on board with the system yes
02:12:35.98 --> 02:12:43.34 it can does the civilian sector do that as well how yes it does happens in any leadership situation
02:12:43.34 --> 02:12:48.30 where we take these things that we should be striving for like freedom of expression and
02:12:48.30 --> 02:12:57.66 unfettered cognitive processes meaning you should just be able to think and we crush them and
02:12:57.66 --> 02:13:04.38 you know I was thinking this uh we've been talking about the the the EO leadership loop
02:13:04.38 --> 02:13:09.74 and included not as the is the Udlu right these ideas of constantly running through your mind
02:13:10.46 --> 02:13:15.58 all these different aspects of leadership and the main list lesson that you and I put
02:13:15.58 --> 02:13:18.86 out this is what we've just put out the monster the main lesson when you're running these loops is
02:13:18.86 --> 02:13:26.14 not to get stuck is not to get stuck is to free your mind and that's how I close out the last
02:13:26.14 --> 02:13:31.50 podcast I said free your mind and I want to reiterate that you have to keep your mind open if your
02:13:31.50 --> 02:13:35.98 minds always stuck even it can be stuck by so many different things it can be stuck by your ego
02:13:35.98 --> 02:13:41.66 your insecurities it can be stuck by your fear it can be stuck by tradition it can be stuck by
02:13:41.66 --> 02:13:47.42 custom it can be stuck by the restraints of the institution that you're in if your mind is
02:13:47.42 --> 02:13:54.46 getting stuck like that you have to be weary you have to be afraid of that because if you let
02:13:54.46 --> 02:14:01.58 your mind get stuck in that fixed position you're gonna get flanked you're gonna get overrun
02:14:01.58 --> 02:14:05.82 and you're gonna get destroyed and if you're in a leadership position that is what's going to happen
02:14:05.82 --> 02:14:16.94 not just to you but to your troops so keep an open mind echo Charles yes what do you got
02:14:18.06 --> 02:14:22.62 that whole that part about like not taking risks of your failure like that kind of stuff like
02:14:22.62 --> 02:14:31.90 first of whatever reason it was making me think of like the jujitsu journey ascending with like
02:14:31.90 --> 02:14:37.66 getting belts and all this stuff so in the beginning yeah I sure a little of my specific but you
02:14:37.66 --> 02:14:43.34 can kind of see it where you know if you're focused on the belt you tend to be more like
02:14:43.34 --> 02:14:50.30 fear failure kind of approach to training and but if you're just like hey I'm in here to get better
02:14:50.30 --> 02:14:55.74 and learn and be humble take risks you would happen all this stuff compete and you know and the
02:14:55.74 --> 02:15:02.86 higher you get the better you'll become yeah but if you start let's say you get like I don't know
02:15:02.86 --> 02:15:07.34 purple about that feel like it's one of the benchmark balance right for sure kind of become
02:15:08.14 --> 02:15:13.50 that's like jujitsu puberty right there you know so a lot of people and it can vary from belt to
02:15:13.50 --> 02:15:17.82 belt for sure but sometimes they'll be like oh well I don't want to look bad as a purple belt
02:15:17.82 --> 02:15:23.02 so let's get less risk I'm not only trained with guys who I know that I won't you know do
02:15:23.02 --> 02:15:28.06 poorly again sir whatever you know and you can kind of fall into that trap but then you get people
02:15:28.06 --> 02:15:32.46 who they don't they don't think about that kind of stuff it's like the belt that's just a byproduct
02:15:32.46 --> 02:15:36.38 of my journey and I don't even think about that those of the guys that that just keep getting
02:15:36.38 --> 02:15:42.30 better yeah yeah I I thought you were actually going to bring up just like the entrepreneurial spirit
02:15:42.30 --> 02:15:47.74 and you know we work with a lot of companies in echelon front and the leaders that have taken
02:15:47.74 --> 02:15:54.30 risk and have broken outside the norm those are leaders that they end up doing exceptionally well
02:15:54.30 --> 02:15:57.98 right if they manage it well like look you can take big risks you can fail right that happens
02:15:59.26 --> 02:16:05.10 that's why they're called risks but if you want to look can you play at safe
02:16:06.38 --> 02:16:10.94 yes you can and you can do that in the corporate world to hey you can you can fall the rules
02:16:10.94 --> 02:16:15.02 and you can do you can and you can move up the chain and that's fine that's fine
02:16:15.02 --> 02:16:19.74 if you want to excel you're going to have to take some chances you're going to have to take some
02:16:19.74 --> 02:16:27.18 risks that's what you're going to have to do and and and then you do if you do utilize sort of the
02:16:27.90 --> 02:16:36.62 the standard sort of conformity to move up the chain what I will be I okay I get it but you know
02:16:36.62 --> 02:16:45.74 what don't suppress don't suppress risk for others don't don't don't suppress entrepreneurial
02:16:45.74 --> 02:16:49.58 thinking from other people inside your organization that's what I think we run into a real problem
02:16:49.58 --> 02:16:55.82 you know I kind of fall the rules and conformed and I got my promotion and then Dave comes along
02:16:55.82 --> 02:16:59.10 and he's a little bit more of a mistake or a little bit more entrepreneurial and this could be
02:16:59.10 --> 02:17:03.10 in the military this could be in the business sector and what do I do I don't rank him I shut
02:17:03.10 --> 02:17:08.46 him down I partially shut him down because I don't want him I don't want him to out out maneuver me
02:17:08.46 --> 02:17:12.38 so I'm just going to shut down on all these ideas I'm also going to shut him down because I don't
02:17:12.38 --> 02:17:20.06 want to take any risk so if you want to if you want to play that game for yourself and you don't
02:17:20.06 --> 02:17:24.22 want to take a bunch of risks and you just want to have a safe comfortable job that's okay that's
02:17:24.22 --> 02:17:29.34 not bad look if you work hard and and and you do a good job inside your business
02:17:29.34 --> 02:17:36.54 organization that's great I I actually like that I appreciate it but the minute you you have
02:17:36.54 --> 02:17:41.58 that attitude and you start to impose it on people around you you need to check yourself you
02:17:41.58 --> 02:17:46.22 need to check yourself because you're shutting down mind your closing minds and you're really
02:17:46.22 --> 02:17:52.86 in the long term hurt in your organization you were come across a situation it feels like it's
02:17:52.86 --> 02:17:56.62 feels like it's real common where you get to people they're going to business together one
02:17:56.62 --> 02:18:02.46 guys risk averse one guys like freaking try anything and they sort of start to balance each other
02:18:02.46 --> 02:18:07.50 for sure and not to mention there's some jobs that are kind of more conducive for certain attitude
02:18:07.50 --> 02:18:11.34 types yeah the risky guys like out doing the sales pitch and the other guys back in the
02:18:11.34 --> 02:18:13.98 compounds in the books yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:18:13.98 --> 02:18:18.70 yeah so it is good to have business partners like that for sure yeah kind of real you in
02:18:18.70 --> 02:18:23.66 when you need it as long as they're not over bearing I guess right there you go there you go
02:18:23.66 --> 02:18:29.82 all right well we're trying to keep our minds open we're trying to improve ourselves mentally
02:18:29.82 --> 02:18:35.74 physically you know poll nine yards echo you got any suggestions yeah what you do I do we do
02:18:35.74 --> 02:18:41.10 well do actually we know you where go no I just want to make sure we're recording oh yeah
02:18:43.66 --> 02:18:49.98 those good thanks Dave by the way so what you got echo Charles what you got for us oh well you know
02:18:49.98 --> 02:18:55.82 we're all working out doing G2 I guess you know hopefully we should be I'm just saying you know
02:18:55.82 --> 02:19:01.42 it's one of those things it does to keep you on the path we're reading mental physical or everything
02:19:01.42 --> 02:19:05.90 right we want to leave by example I'll tell you that I want to make good decisions until you
02:19:05.90 --> 02:19:11.66 that so all right on this path we're on this path good decisions physical capability
02:19:12.30 --> 02:19:18.38 mental capability we'll say you did not tell us what it is yes and improvement yes we want to take risk
02:19:18.38 --> 02:19:23.42 but not too many risk check we want to take risk but not too big of risks okay
02:19:23.42 --> 02:19:29.82 okay so one thing you don't want to risk is your health tell you that thing you risk
02:19:29.82 --> 02:19:33.42 what did you write that little setup right there I just came out with you so you
02:19:33.42 --> 02:19:40.54 speak in a mental security look at you look at that guy anyway you said all that stuff
02:19:40.54 --> 02:19:44.70 just to say we don't take too many risks with our health there you go it's just tying it in
02:19:44.70 --> 02:19:49.34 through if you don't get all together man I'm just saying it's freaking impressive not the thing to
02:19:49.34 --> 02:19:58.22 take risk with the hell yeah for the support juggle okay so we got energy drinks those
02:19:58.22 --> 02:20:03.42 might we got energy drinks not old school energy drinks that do risk your health we have energy
02:20:03.42 --> 02:20:08.22 drinks that don't risk your health that actually improve your health no risk upside across the
02:20:08.22 --> 02:20:13.34 board cross the board no gambling or upside across the board yes right if I was to say hey this
02:20:13.34 --> 02:20:18.86 thing over here can make you feel good yeah and you were like okay cool and it not only can
02:20:18.86 --> 02:20:24.38 it make you feel good it can actually make you be more healthy yeah what would you say to that
02:20:24.38 --> 02:20:28.14 that's a cool that's do you say cool what if I had something else over here and I was like this
02:20:28.14 --> 02:20:33.18 will also make you feel good for a little bit and you said okay that sounds good but then I said after
02:20:33.18 --> 02:20:38.30 that you're going to be addicted to it and you're going to end up becoming a crystal math
02:20:38.30 --> 02:20:44.38 and fed me addict and dying yes that would be best downside yes sir that's downside so we like
02:20:44.38 --> 02:20:49.74 the little we like the little hype that we got from the crystal math that that I gave you
02:20:49.74 --> 02:20:54.54 sure but then the downside is like a disaster you're teeth are falling out you lost your job
02:20:54.54 --> 02:20:58.78 there's all kinds of problems in the future that is true yes so I'm not going to sell you that
02:20:58.78 --> 02:21:02.78 no I'm not going to want you to take that you're not going to recommend that you're correct
02:21:02.78 --> 02:21:07.42 but I've got something else over here yes it's going to give you that hype yes with zero
02:21:07.42 --> 02:21:13.82 downside all hype zero downside and this is I will not find you at a you know a meth lab
02:21:13.82 --> 02:21:18.94 slicking the floor which is what I'm afraid of if I give you the other thing that is an
02:21:18.94 --> 02:21:23.98 undesirable outcome yes sir so yes so when you're choosing energy drink you look
02:21:23.98 --> 02:21:29.10 over energy drink even if not even into energy drinks necessarily and I understand if you're not
02:21:29.10 --> 02:21:34.22 because really how could you be when you consider those yes yes now we got a solution for that
02:21:34.22 --> 02:21:40.86 yeah straight up all healthy energy drink completely good for you jockel discipline go yeah
02:21:40.86 --> 02:21:47.50 my jockel it's a good one uh taste good two different flavors so far the apparently on paper
02:21:48.78 --> 02:21:54.78 the more popular one is orange afterburner orange afterburner orange Dave Burr good deal
02:21:54.78 --> 02:21:59.26 days signature flavor on paper is good it's makes sense you know like if you don't know if you're
02:21:59.26 --> 02:22:04.46 not in the know you go you you you have a awesome selection you know you know that the orange is
02:22:04.46 --> 02:22:10.46 going to come through wouldn't you agree yes yeah I feel the same way I feel the same way but you
02:22:10.46 --> 02:22:16.30 want to take a little bit more risk right maybe a higher up side maybe bringing the
02:22:16.30 --> 02:22:21.50 thread to the wall for the baby look I don't know I don't know I'm just a person but hey
02:22:21.50 --> 02:22:26.86 maybe though you take a little bit more risk on a more exotic flavor like mango
02:22:26.86 --> 02:22:31.58 mango passion fruit to be specific you might wind up with that bigger upside I don't know
02:22:31.58 --> 02:22:36.46 that's up to you but nonetheless there are many different flavors of choose whichever one all of
02:22:36.46 --> 02:22:40.54 them are all upside no downside so it doesn't matter technically at the end of their what flavor
02:22:40.54 --> 02:22:47.90 you choose that's for your own personal choice so get some of that discipline go well
02:22:47.90 --> 02:22:53.10 so got joint warfare acrylic oil we got the discipline powder we got some new what what do you call
02:22:53.10 --> 02:23:00.30 hype well they're not technically called hype I think they're called pre workout mixes powers
02:23:01.02 --> 02:23:07.66 so so we've had the discipline powder for a while just called discipline and it didn't have
02:23:07.66 --> 02:23:13.50 much caffeine in it to be real specific and people are like hey that's cool we appreciate it but
02:23:13.50 --> 02:23:20.38 sometimes we want more of a kick so we didn't go nuts we didn't go 700 milligrams of caffeine
02:23:20.38 --> 02:23:27.74 yeah do you know the number 95 95 per scoop okay okay per scoop okay so that's more moderate I would say
02:23:27.74 --> 02:23:32.22 oh it then it's moderate unless you have two scoops or three scoops right which is which is
02:23:32.22 --> 02:23:39.10 because gay the classic pre workout if you go two scoops that's too much right it's too much
02:23:39.10 --> 02:23:42.70 yeah but at the same time if you if you don't want to get all nuts whether you got to start
02:23:42.70 --> 02:23:46.86 meticulously putting only a little bit of powder you can't really bet you know so I dig it so yeah
02:23:46.86 --> 02:23:52.70 that that makes sense put if you need 300 milligrams of caffeine before one workout if that's what you need
02:23:52.70 --> 02:23:57.90 oh no it's I'm not hey dig it man I dig it like you just have three scoops you
02:23:57.90 --> 02:24:02.70 yeah I would say back off a little bit that's my personal generally speaking but here's the
02:24:02.70 --> 02:24:09.02 thing also do some abstinence days right yeah yes like on the weekend you know whatever on
02:24:09.02 --> 02:24:13.90 month whatever some days be like yeah I'm not gonna have any at all yeah any caffeine at all
02:24:13.90 --> 02:24:18.62 generally speaking I feel like that's a good move anyway did not go every single day whatever like
02:24:18.62 --> 02:24:23.98 give yourself a break whatever and that way you maximize the effects anyway that's what I'm talking
02:24:23.98 --> 02:24:27.82 about yeah sir I think you're right about that but you've never really been that hard current
02:24:27.82 --> 02:24:34.22 because let's face it a pre workout it gives you like a bigger pump yeah no I've pre workout really
02:24:34.22 --> 02:24:39.18 is my thing the own unless you count due to you as a workout which we've had this discussion lately
02:24:39.18 --> 02:24:45.90 that's not really a workout but like I would have disciplined powder before going to the jujitsu
02:24:45.90 --> 02:24:52.30 right and I still will do that but as far as I'm just rolling in with a freaking pump in hard
02:24:52.30 --> 02:24:57.02 I'm not really down for that with a dream and that's technically that's not why we take pre
02:24:57.02 --> 02:25:02.38 workout too for workouts like jujitsu jujitsu I I consider jujitsu workout that's a hard workout actually
02:25:02.38 --> 02:25:07.02 it's harder workout technically it's for the output goes most of the time more than your average
02:25:07.02 --> 02:25:12.62 other workout just hand on the workout obviously but let's say if you're going in you're going to do
02:25:15.02 --> 02:25:21.74 eight sets of 12 with some bench and then maybe some try-sev extensions curls this kind of thing
02:25:21.74 --> 02:25:27.74 you take a pre workout that's that's the jam you say that's it so we made one of these for people
02:25:27.74 --> 02:25:34.22 like echo Charles I want to get it all it's a disciplined go powder you available now
02:25:34.22 --> 02:25:39.90 you know it may go bad yeah you get some mango other flavors more if you need some protein tastes like
02:25:39.90 --> 02:25:45.58 dessert one of the best things that have ever been invented I'm expecting probably they have a
02:25:45.58 --> 02:25:53.26 noble prize for dessert no they have a noble prize for protein chicks well now you know I
02:25:53.26 --> 02:25:57.02 not that I'm aware of that you know let's face it there should be one yes and actually more
02:25:57.02 --> 02:26:01.82 than you know really because they like okay you know you heard of people making like a moch pancakes
02:26:01.82 --> 02:26:09.34 you know the stuff okay here's the jam keep this in mind do this moch shake frozen banana the whole
02:26:09.34 --> 02:26:14.78 jam whole creaminess that's all see all that right so so make make that when the kids are at
02:26:14.78 --> 02:26:19.90 looking then you buy those little popsicle what are you called for you you know the ones right
02:26:19.90 --> 02:26:26.14 they can make popsicles in and you make popsicles then you tell the kids hey like have a surprise for
02:26:26.14 --> 02:26:29.90 you after dinner because you know you dinner are all good right I have a surprise sake of cool they're
02:26:29.90 --> 02:26:35.18 excited you bust out that pop it looks like one of those pudding pops yeah you seem saying so that's
02:26:35.18 --> 02:26:41.34 what you've been doing no I'm gonna do it yeah but if you say and that's a good idea so say all right
02:26:41.34 --> 02:26:48.14 that's the moch no bell prize running moch white jocco i teach by the way you can get the stuff you

02:27:14.06 --> 02:27:19.58 you could just say American American but it's sad that the American iconic jeans that you have
02:27:19.58 --> 02:27:24.46 aren't even made in America not you but I mean us we as a nation a lot of people are out there
02:27:24.46 --> 02:27:29.02 wearing jeans they think or made in America yeah they're not made in America they're um they're
02:27:29.02 --> 02:27:34.86 pitched yeah they might be packaged in America but really there's communist that are making
02:27:34.86 --> 02:27:42.78 the juice and it's nothing against the people but the government has those people enslaved
02:27:43.58 --> 02:27:49.18 so we we're not for that we're against that you know I saw you compete on the new
02:27:49.18 --> 02:27:56.38 the other day no yeah we're doing yeah we're out there this are you know where the story
02:27:56.38 --> 02:28:00.86 yeah I think so this is this we're bringing it manufacturing back to America you gotta tell
02:28:00.86 --> 02:28:06.30 some of those guys to stop jamming up your name bro I just maybe I should I don't know they call

02:28:17.66 --> 02:28:22.70 but I feel like they're kind of pronouncing my name wrong it's weird that you would do that it says
02:28:22.70 --> 02:28:27.98 will ink that's literally what it says yes how you reverse those numbers and or worse those
02:28:27.98 --> 02:28:31.74 letters and stuff I don't know but that's what happens and I don't know you start to want to have you
02:28:31.74 --> 02:28:38.62 have they not heard anyone else say your name ever yeah it's strange it is odd right kind of strange
