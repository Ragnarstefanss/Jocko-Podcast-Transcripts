00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.72 This is Jockel Podcast number 248, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willing. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
00:00:08.64 --> 00:00:16.64 As the summer of 1970 evolved, the deadly secret war and loused raged into its sixth year.
00:00:17.44 --> 00:00:22.72 The communist NVA and its secret advisors from Russia, China and Cuba, continued supplying
00:00:22.72 --> 00:00:27.52 growing numbers of light and heavy weapons, stated the art anti-aircraft artillery,
00:00:27.52 --> 00:00:35.12 missiles and vehicles. The communist campaign against Saga Reconyssans teams resulted in the
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:43.12 green berets exceeding a 100% casualty rate, meaning of the special forces soldiers who went
00:00:43.12 --> 00:00:49.68 across the fence into Lousen Cambodia, all were either killed in action, wounded more than once
00:00:49.68 --> 00:00:58.96 in combat with enemy forces, or they simply disappeared. As of July 4th, 2017, there are 50
00:00:58.96 --> 00:01:06.000 green berets listed as missing an action in Lousen alone from the secret war, along with 105
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.36 aviators who died supporting Saga missions. Saga hatchet force operations of platoon or company-sized
00:01:15.36 --> 00:01:21.68 missions didn't fare much better. In an effort to bring a temporary halt to shipping supplies
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:28.48 flowing down the Ho Chi-Mintrail, three separate hatchet force slam operations were conducted in
00:01:28.48 --> 00:01:36.16 Lousen west of South Vietnam between March 1969 and February 1970. The area of operations
00:01:36.16 --> 00:01:46.56 was codenamed Prairie Fire. Again, due to the severe political constraints placed on Saga operations,
00:01:46.56 --> 00:01:52.40 the Prairie Fire area of operations extended west of South Vietnam about 30 miles.
00:01:53.60 --> 00:02:00.64 No Saga teams went beyond that area of operations. The three slam operations were titled
00:02:00.64 --> 00:02:08.80 Nightcap, Spin Down, and Halfback. Each of those operations had a hatchet force company helicopter
00:02:08.80 --> 00:02:16.24 to a hilltop on the main segment of the Ho Chi-Mintrail. The trips would dig in, set up ambushes,
00:02:16.24 --> 00:02:23.52 and target NBA trucking. After the lead trucks were hit, there would be a traffic backup
00:02:23.52 --> 00:02:30.16 along the jungle trail. Oftentimes large portions of the Ho Chi-Mintrail were not visible from
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:37.20 air due to clever camouflage efforts by the NBA and their constricted forced labor of local
00:02:37.20 --> 00:02:44.56 indigenous tribe people. Thus, when the first trucks were hit, hatchet force radio operators
00:02:44.56 --> 00:02:50.32 would call in tactical air support to destroy as many enemy trucks and soldiers as possible.
00:02:52.16 --> 00:02:57.92 Eventually, after a few days, the NBA masked hundreds of soldiers to hammer the hatchet force
00:02:57.92 --> 00:03:03.52 positions, inflicting serious casualties upon the entrenched troops, forcing their extraction
00:03:03.52 --> 00:03:12.40 from the area of operations. During the last mission, Operation Halfback, an aged 34 South Vietnamese
00:03:12.40 --> 00:03:19.92 Air Force helicopter from the 219th Special Operation Squadron was shot down, killing all passengers
00:03:19.92 --> 00:03:28.96 aboard the old warbird, including Special Forces Medic, Sergeant 1st Class Bill Doyle. Those
00:03:28.96 --> 00:03:34.64 operations were viewed as successes due to the amount of enemy trucks, supplies, and troops
00:03:34.64 --> 00:03:42.56 destroyed during the intense battles. The three slam operations were launched from the top secret
00:03:42.56 --> 00:03:50.16 sag base in Con-Tune, command and control central. The last slam operation was run by B company
00:03:50.16 --> 00:03:57.52 in hatchet force command. By the end of August 1970, Greenbrake Captain Jean Maccarli
00:03:57.52 --> 00:04:04.40 became the commander of B company. Maccarli was a sag veteran, having run missions during the last
00:04:04.40 --> 00:04:13.60 few months of 1967 and into 1968 when he was assigned to RT Florida out of Con-Tune in 1968.
00:04:15.44 --> 00:04:21.04 RT Florida ran a series of successful missions, including a trail watch,
00:04:21.04 --> 00:04:26.48 wire taps of NBA phone lines, and planning Air Force sensors alongside a trail.
00:04:26.48 --> 00:04:34.80 At the end of August, Maccarli heard through the grapevine that a major hatchet force operation
00:04:34.80 --> 00:04:39.28 was coming through the chain of command and he volunteered B company for it.
00:04:40.88 --> 00:04:46.56 Assuming it might be another slam operation, Maccarli researched and the after-actions reports
00:04:46.56 --> 00:04:52.000 from the previous missions. He talked to team members in camp about those operations,
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.52 their successes, their shortcomings. In the first days of September 1970,
00:05:00.16 --> 00:05:06.08 the operations order came down and was assigned to B company under the command of Maccarli.
00:05:08.24 --> 00:05:15.04 It was dubbed Operation Tailwind. And much to Maccarli's surprise,
00:05:15.04 --> 00:05:21.52 Operation Tailwind was targeted for the deepest insertion into Laos ever by a sag team.
00:05:21.52 --> 00:05:26.88 25 to 30 miles beyond the normal area of operations.
00:05:28.96 --> 00:05:34.24 The operation was designed to take pressure off a CIA operation
00:05:34.24 --> 00:05:40.32 further southwest bordering Cambodia. Because the unique nature of this mission,
00:05:40.32 --> 00:05:46.000 Maccarli drew upon his years of operational experience in Laos for a daring new tactic.
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.84 Instead of remaining in a static position like the earlier slam missions,
00:05:51.84 --> 00:05:57.68 once the full element B company, 15 green berets and 120 highly trained
00:05:57.68 --> 00:06:02.72 Montengarde tribesmen were all in the ground in the deepest penetration of enemy territory during
00:06:02.72 --> 00:06:09.92 the Secret War, he would move day and night, supported by air assets from the Air Force Army
00:06:09.92 --> 00:06:19.36 and Marine Corps. It would be an epic mission. In hindsight, 47 years later, although no one
00:06:19.36 --> 00:06:25.12 said so at the time, most agreed it was a suicide mission.
00:06:30.88 --> 00:06:36.16 And that right there is from the prologue of a book called
00:06:36.16 --> 00:06:45.52 Saga Chronicles Volume 1 written by John Stryker Meyer, otherwise known by his Nickname and
00:06:45.52 --> 00:06:52.96 Code name and call sign, tilt and it is once again an honor to have.
00:06:52.96 --> 00:07:00.48 Tilt here with us as he has been here before for podcasts 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180,
00:07:00.48 --> 00:07:08.80 186, 247 and now 248. If you haven't listened to those yet, go listen to them to understand
00:07:08.80 --> 00:07:17.36 what Saga was and what heroes these men were including this man, my hero, John Stryker Meyer,
00:07:17.36 --> 00:07:22.48 tilt, thanks for coming back on. Good evening sir, good evening. Welcome.
00:07:22.48 --> 00:07:30.48 Thanks for coming back. It's my honor. So this is just a story that you and I had talked about
00:07:30.88 --> 00:07:35.84 some of the different stories that we've covered and you know, you've kind of, I guess you
00:07:35.84 --> 00:07:41.04 kind of somehow ended up being a little bit of the the Saga historian, capturing a bunch of these
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:47.28 stories from different operations even when you weren't there, but interviewing guys, talk
00:07:47.28 --> 00:07:52.80 to them, gathering all this information and then capturing and putting these books. But it has the
00:07:54.48 --> 00:08:00.24 I mean, since you were in Saga and you operated in these areas of operations that these guys
00:08:00.24 --> 00:08:06.96 were in, the way you were able to tell the story is is powerful. Well, thank you. But this book here
00:08:06.96 --> 00:08:12.000 is the first one that doesn't have my stories and that's why I like because that's why
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.52 goal is going to be for saw Chronicles is my little hubble company and we're going to write these
00:08:17.52 --> 00:08:22.96 stories until we die because there's so many that have never been told. And this mission,
00:08:22.96 --> 00:08:28.24 Operation TL when it was a classic, I'd heard little tidbits about it over the years, but
00:08:29.12 --> 00:08:35.52 until and we'll get into details later, how with 98, there's some facts that came out twisted
00:08:35.52 --> 00:08:40.72 on that due to the communist news network. But, factually, this is just an amazing mission.
00:08:40.72 --> 00:08:48.72 And so many levels. And it was a classic example of a saw operation with men on the ground,
00:08:49.52 --> 00:08:57.28 doing the mission, got it accomplished. And they worked with Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps
00:08:57.28 --> 00:09:04.48 Air Assets. I think for fast moves to gunships, and Jean McCarlay was just an outstanding soldier,
00:09:04.48 --> 00:09:12.24 a soldier soldier. And he started out as a listed, became an officer. So he never lost that grounding,
00:09:12.24 --> 00:09:18.16 but just one hell of a commander in here, he just, that was his concept. And they ran with it,
00:09:18.16 --> 00:09:26.000 and we get into this story, just amazing stuff. Yeah, the air superiority that we had was
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.36 really powerful. But you have to remember that it wasn't totally our superiority. It wasn't like,
00:09:33.36 --> 00:09:40.40 look, we have air superiority in Iraq and Afghanistan. We very rarely will lose an aircraft
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:43.44 then, usually it's because there's some kind of an accident or a crash or something like that.
00:09:44.08 --> 00:09:48.64 But even though it's pretty easy to say, oh, yeah, we had full air superiority in Vietnam.
00:09:49.28 --> 00:09:54.96 We had a certain level of confidence. But at the same time, we didn't have totally our superiority,
00:09:54.96 --> 00:10:00.96 because there was still aircraft getting shot down by either migs or getting shot down by
00:10:00.96 --> 00:10:08.08 surface to air missiles. Yeah, because you had two separate air wars. You had the air war over
00:10:08.08 --> 00:10:13.28 North Vietnam. That's the Air Force in the Navy, just pounded away, losing hundreds of men.
00:10:13.92 --> 00:10:18.40 And it had the whole POW, where there were many where we turned, I forget the exact never.
00:10:19.12 --> 00:10:25.28 And they came back in February of 73 through April 73. They came back. So that is more of a
00:10:25.28 --> 00:10:31.76 traditional yet as maigs that were trained by the Russians, etc. And some even said to Russians flu.
00:10:31.76 --> 00:10:37.20 I don't know. We were more concerned with down south in the Prairie Fire AO in Cambodia.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.84 Over time, as the war progressed, particularly after Lyndon Johnson had the bombing hall in
00:10:43.84 --> 00:10:51.68 78, man, the anti aircraft stuff, the 12.7 to 23 millimeter, 37 mic mic and heavier stuff.
00:10:51.68 --> 00:10:59.36 And one of the stories later here is one of our medics. He members flying out and
00:10:59.36 --> 00:11:04.72 will have some cup of that stupid history later. But in a way out to his act act in the air.
00:11:04.72 --> 00:11:10.72 Just like World War II. When you see 12 o'clock high and all of it, you see all the act act
00:11:11.28 --> 00:11:15.20 that shot down all of our airplanes and World War II. There it was, courtesy of the Russians.
00:11:16.08 --> 00:11:20.72 And they were shooting at our hillock hopters. And so the dock page was like,
00:11:20.72 --> 00:11:24.24 oh my god, this is like watching a World War II movie, but it's right here.
00:11:25.12 --> 00:11:30.08 And so that is our world. And this is the World War II movie, except I think I might get killed.
00:11:31.76 --> 00:11:34.80 And in World War II, they didn't have any helicopters that we know about.
00:11:36.64 --> 00:11:41.92 And so that is the aspect where, like in your introduction, we talked about the MIAs
00:11:41.92 --> 00:11:46.16 today, missing an action, the Americans that were shot down supporting sod.
00:11:46.16 --> 00:11:52.000 That's everything from fast movers down to the smallest hillock hopters, the loach. And of course
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.08 you're meeting me here for us like with this story we talked about on Tuesday with the limb black.
00:11:58.48 --> 00:12:04.72 On the visual reconnaissance, it's just a little dinky observation aircraft. The copolysis head blown off
00:12:04.72 --> 00:12:10.80 Lily and his head and helmet lands on the lens lap. So those are the casualties that went into our war.
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:18.16 That's our side of the air war. So we dominated the air, but that air was full of anti-aircraft weaponry deadly.
00:12:18.56 --> 00:12:19.84 Yeah. Absolutely.
00:12:22.40 --> 00:12:28.08 Well, I guess we should get into this this story because this this tailwind is
00:12:29.68 --> 00:12:35.36 is just kind of crazy. No, they saw another day. It's all right. So here we go.
00:12:35.36 --> 00:12:39.68 Going to the book, Sog Chronicles, Volume 1. And for everyone that's hopeful out there,
00:12:39.68 --> 00:12:43.28 there's going to be Volume 2, 3, 4, 5. The Lord will.
00:12:45.60 --> 00:12:50.000 I know there's more stories than you got time to write. I mean it's good. There's so many stories.
00:12:50.72 --> 00:12:54.24 Every one of these operations is its own book. Oh yeah.
00:12:55.28 --> 00:13:00.40 You know, every time I read one of your books and I read one operation,
00:13:00.96 --> 00:13:06.48 I think there's a whole story, a whole book, a three or four hundred page book about every single
00:13:06.48 --> 00:13:13.92 operation. If you start going into the granular detail in the backstory, it's it's crazy. So
00:13:14.56 --> 00:13:20.40 get to work. To keep writing. Yes, sir. All right. Here we go.
00:13:21.20 --> 00:13:26.88 Routinely under protocols established in an early Sog Secret War. Most laosian
00:13:27.52 --> 00:13:32.48 Sog operators were limited to 20 kilometers west of Vietnam's borders. Operation tailwind was
00:13:32.48 --> 00:13:39.44 book to go approximately 40 kilometers further west beyond that limitation. To go that deep and
00:13:39.44 --> 00:13:44.56 allows required formal approval from the laosian ambassador and from the US Commander of
00:13:44.56 --> 00:13:51.76 all forces in Vietnam, General Creighton at Abrams. McCarty, the B company commanding officer at the
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:57.92 Top Secret Sog compound in Cone Tomb. Might say that right Cone Tomb? Cone Tomb. Commanding
00:13:57.92 --> 00:14:05.04 Control Central got the word from S3 on September 4th, 1970. And he says, I remember getting
00:14:05.04 --> 00:14:09.84 called by S3 and they told me that we had a special mission. A mission that was deep into laos,
00:14:09.84 --> 00:14:15.12 a mission deeper and allows than ever before. And a mission bigger than any before in the prayer
00:14:15.12 --> 00:14:26.08 refire a.o. Said McCarty. They told me to go heavy on ammo and demo. I knew that such a mission would
00:14:26.08 --> 00:14:32.40 take special clearance up to the ambassador who is no friend of Sog and from Abrams, that's General Abrams,
00:14:32.40 --> 00:14:38.96 who is no big fan of special forces. In short order, he learned that all of the approvals
00:14:38.96 --> 00:14:43.44 had been received and signed off. So this is a massive mission. Bigger than any mission, deeper and
00:14:43.44 --> 00:14:50.56 allows than ever before. And that means you got to get approval from the ambassador. And generally,
00:14:50.56 --> 00:14:57.12 if you don't know this, ambassadors usually aren't fond of military actions inside their, inside their
00:14:57.12 --> 00:15:01.92 arena, that's the right that they want. And that one ambassador just made life so difficult for Sog
00:15:01.92 --> 00:15:06.40 from every day that we're open there. Yeah, I mean, ambassadors, if you think about it, just from a
00:15:06.40 --> 00:15:13.36 philosophical level, you know, they want to solve things through diplomacy. And, and so generally,
00:15:13.36 --> 00:15:19.04 they have a little bit of a of a friction with the military elements, generally, not always.
00:15:19.92 --> 00:15:26.48 And then you have Abrams, who's not a fan of special forces, which I believe we've done a good
00:15:26.48 --> 00:15:32.40 job of moving this in a better direction, but there certainly has been tension from time to time
00:15:32.40 --> 00:15:38.56 between conventional forces and special forces and special operations, guys, generally because
00:15:38.56 --> 00:15:44.64 special operations, guys, well, they don't follow the same rules all the time that the conventional
00:15:44.64 --> 00:15:49.04 guys follow. And they might have a little bit of an attitude and that can rub them the wrong way.
00:15:49.04 --> 00:15:56.80 And a little bit. So, you know, you got a guy like General Abrams, it doesn't like special forces,
00:15:56.80 --> 00:16:01.44 except when he needs them, except when he needs them, well, there you go. And he needed them here. So,
00:16:03.44 --> 00:16:09.28 continuing on later that day, S3 provided more specific details, go heavy, create havoc for the
00:16:09.28 --> 00:16:18.32 NVA and keep them busy as long as possible. Maccarly, a former team leader of Sog Recon team Florida,
00:16:18.32 --> 00:16:23.28 where he ran seven successful missions transferred to the hatchet force where Green
00:16:23.28 --> 00:16:30.24 Braves ran platoon and company sized operations across the fence in Lousen, Cambodia. So, just so
00:16:30.24 --> 00:16:36.64 everyone gets a grip on this, these hatchet forces. Now you have instead of having 12 guys on the ground,
00:16:36.64 --> 00:16:42.40 or six, or six guys on the ground, like you would with one of your recon teams. Now you're talking
00:16:42.40 --> 00:16:49.04 about a group of special forces, guys, maybe 10, 12, 15 special forces, American special forces,
00:16:49.04 --> 00:16:59.12 guys, and then 120 or 150, in-ditch force. So, in this case, there are mountain yards,
00:17:00.08 --> 00:17:04.16 and that means you can conduct these bigger operations. And that's really the
00:17:05.12 --> 00:17:10.96 fundamental mission of special forces. Of the Green Braves is to work with in-ditch forces,
00:17:10.96 --> 00:17:15.76 train up these guerrilla forces so that they can become a strong fighting unit. The Seals
00:17:15.76 --> 00:17:22.000 have a different primary mission. The Seals primary mission was always generally considered to be
00:17:22.56 --> 00:17:28.08 special, direct action and special reconnaissance. Find the enemy, kill. Yep, that's the Seals,
00:17:28.88 --> 00:17:35.04 and the special forces was more, hey, find the enemy and then train some of the local
00:17:35.04 --> 00:17:39.52 populists to go kill them. That's the goal. And it's more of a long-term solution. You know,
00:17:39.52 --> 00:17:42.88 you'll hear the Green Braves say it's teach him how to fish instead of just giving him a fish.
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:50.88 Seal teams, we just kill the first general. Now, we both cross over. And we both do each one,
00:17:50.88 --> 00:17:54.40 you know, we do their operations when I was in Ramadi, that's what we did. We trained a bunch of
00:17:55.12 --> 00:18:00.72 in-ditch forces, a bunch of Iraqi soldiers. And, you know, of course, there were special forces units
00:18:00.72 --> 00:18:05.28 that were doing all kinds of direct action missions there as well. So, we do cross over. But if you
00:18:05.28 --> 00:18:10.64 look at the kind of bread and butter, this is just bread and butter, Green Brave operation,
00:18:10.64 --> 00:18:17.68 a massive in-ditch force going into to do to harass the enemy. Oh, yeah. This is what it,
00:18:17.68 --> 00:18:21.92 this is what it is. Take the pressure off of the CIA, you know, to a witness, as kicked.
00:18:21.92 --> 00:18:26.24 Explain that background a little bit about what's going on with the CIA there. Well, at that time,
00:18:26.64 --> 00:18:32.88 Premier Sionok had been asked it. And this is 1970, I forget these act a month, but like
00:18:32.88 --> 00:18:38.16 Mayor June, right around there. And so he leaves country. There's a political vacuum. And so the
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:45.44 communist, one ahead south in mass, because many troops in Cambodia just to take it. Because the
00:18:45.44 --> 00:18:52.08 NVA knew there was a Camille Rouge element that was on a sideline and growing in strength in Cambodia.
00:18:53.20 --> 00:19:00.80 So, the CIA put this operation together, which was further, deeper into the last near-to-border.
00:19:00.80 --> 00:19:08.40 And the NVA came at them hard. Now, they had 5,000 CIA troops in their getting their ass kicked.
00:19:08.96 --> 00:19:14.48 And they said help. So, they came up with this concept, have the team go in,
00:19:15.36 --> 00:19:21.76 and then Gene McCalley put his little unique spin to it. And after talking, because by 1970,
00:19:22.88 --> 00:19:27.84 particularly out of costume, those hatchet forces were good. They really knew how to work with the
00:19:27.84 --> 00:19:34.16 Air Assets and it's which includes Spectre Knight. And so Gene knew all about that stuff.
00:19:34.80 --> 00:19:42.96 And so he put that idea together and it worked in terms of drawing the way NVA from the CIA,
00:19:42.96 --> 00:19:48.64 which in the end, mission accomplished. Not only did they draw them away, the CIA could hold,
00:19:49.44 --> 00:19:54.64 but they also had some major enemy cashiers in the command post. And that's why my favorite
00:19:54.64 --> 00:19:58.64 picture on a front page, there's a picture of our guys from Contune,
00:19:59.44 --> 00:20:06.000 Stanner with a picture of Ho Chi Minh, which was taken from one of the tables in the command center
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.24 there, it was the NVA command center. When I was going through what they call seal,
00:20:12.96 --> 00:20:16.96 was called seal tactical training before that was called seal basic in dock.
00:20:17.68 --> 00:20:21.76 And then it became seal qualification training. It's like, what you do when you get done with the
00:20:21.76 --> 00:20:28.88 basic training, we did a raid on a target. And this is up in Fort Lewis, Washington.
00:20:28.88 --> 00:20:36.72 Then so we do a raid on a target and they're flying a flag on this little compound, right?
00:20:36.72 --> 00:20:41.20 And they're flying this flag and sure enough the the officer in charge of our class,
00:20:41.84 --> 00:20:45.84 which was now the the Platoon commander of our Platoon going to do this hit.
00:20:45.84 --> 00:20:51.28 He sees that flag, walks over to it, undoes the figure eight, starts pulling it down and sure
00:20:51.28 --> 00:20:56.24 enough the instructors have booby trapped that thing in a blow's up. You're a casualty.
00:20:56.24 --> 00:21:00.72 So when I said that picture on the cover, I always think, man, I was always scared to touch anything
00:21:00.72 --> 00:21:05.76 that looked good. Absolutely. Yeah, if the first day of a low school, maybe it's too good.
00:21:05.76 --> 00:21:15.20 Yeah, but you know, those, a lot of guys, a lot of guys from the war and Iraq, a lot of guys
00:21:15.20 --> 00:21:20.64 went home with with paintings of Saddam Hussein because those things were pretty easy to find.
00:21:20.64 --> 00:21:26.48 They were everywhere. Yes indeed. Yeah. All right, going back to the book with the hatchet
00:21:26.48 --> 00:21:31.12 force or the hatch force, we were used to going across the fence and getting our ass kicked and
00:21:31.12 --> 00:21:37.36 then getting saved by tack air. On operation half back and louser earlier in the year, we lost
00:21:37.36 --> 00:21:43.84 two South Vietnamese Air Force H34s, which included SF Medic Bill Boyle who died in one of those
00:21:43.84 --> 00:21:48.96 choppers. We got hit hard because we were dug in and the NVA pounded our position.
00:21:48.96 --> 00:21:54.48 With operation tail would tailwind once on the ground, we were going to keep moving day and night
00:21:54.48 --> 00:21:59.92 to keep the NVA off balance and keep them from massing a large force against our position.
00:22:01.04 --> 00:22:05.20 It's it's fundamental. What we're talking about is maneuver warfare, right?
00:22:05.20 --> 00:22:09.04 Instead of saying hey, we'll do a Trishon warfare. We'll sit on this this mountain top and you attack us.
00:22:09.60 --> 00:22:12.88 Hey, we're going to move around and you know, won't know where we are.
00:22:13.60 --> 00:22:17.04 But that's tricky too. Moving 150 guys around in the J.
00:22:17.04 --> 00:22:20.08 In the jungle indeed. In the J. As they say.
00:22:23.20 --> 00:22:27.84 Although no one said to at the time, at least not outright, the mission that Maccarlie and the CCC
00:22:27.84 --> 00:22:33.20 hatchet force were gearing up for to execute could be called a suicide mission. As Maccarlie
00:22:33.20 --> 00:22:39.92 briefed the B company, platoon leaders, squad leaders, medic Gary Mike Rose and company first
00:22:39.92 --> 00:22:47.12 surgeon Morris Adair in the CCC compound operation orders were going out to critical support
00:22:47.12 --> 00:22:52.88 elements that would play crucial roles in operation tailwind. First, there was a the long distance
00:22:52.88 --> 00:22:58.88 to the target in Louss because it was so far away, neither the older piston driven H34
00:22:58.88 --> 00:23:05.04 secorceky helicopters of the South Vietnamese armies or South Vietnamese Air Force 219 special
00:23:05.04 --> 00:23:12.56 operation squadron nor regular army hewis slicks could be used to insert and extract the 136
00:23:12.56 --> 00:23:18.24 man detachment. So you got just to straight up fuel limitation. Absolutely. These aircraft
00:23:18.24 --> 00:23:23.28 they're not going to be able to fly that deep into Louss. So what does that mean? Back to the book.
00:23:23.28 --> 00:23:29.68 Thus, Sog Brass turned to the Marine Corps aviation wing that flew the largest troop carriers in
00:23:29.68 --> 00:23:40.000 Vietnam. The powerful CH53D secorceky twin-engine helicopters in an HMH 463 based at the
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.24 Cores Marble Mountain Air Facility. Using the bigger stronger heavier lift helicopters made
00:23:46.24 --> 00:23:52.96 sense because three sea stallions with the with the design capacity hold 55 troops could take the
00:23:52.96 --> 00:24:00.08 entire hatchet force of 136 men all their equipment and extra supplies such as explosives and
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:09.28 an ammunition and insert them into the target area. So there you go. The CH53 helicopter is a massive
00:24:09.68 --> 00:24:16.88 freaking helicopter. Oh yeah. It holds 50 something troops with all their gear and all their rounds
00:24:16.88 --> 00:24:22.08 for their weapons. Yeah, that's a that's an awesome aircraft and those were the only two engines in
00:24:22.08 --> 00:24:27.36 this before they came out of the three-engine model like you used. Oh, see I got that. I got it easy.
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:37.44 In previous years Marine Corps Aviators from HMH 463 had performed fearlessly and key
00:24:37.44 --> 00:24:42.40 saw operations across the fence and Marine Brass knew that flying combat troops and supplies
00:24:42.40 --> 00:24:48.96 into Louss always resulted in the helicopters getting hit by enemy fire. In the first day said
00:24:48.96 --> 00:24:53.36 Maccarli it was funny. The Marine Brass were a little reluctant to go that deep and allows
00:24:53.36 --> 00:24:59.76 because they knew the sog missions presented extra challenges and dangers to Marine Air crews.
00:24:59.76 --> 00:25:05.28 But once they heard about the unique aspects of operations to Operation Tailwind, they wanted in.
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:12.40 Marine Sergeant Larry Gro, my saying that right, Gro was a door gunner and structural mechanic,
00:25:12.40 --> 00:25:19.84 structural mechanic in HMH 463 when the operations order came into the command shed and denang. The
00:25:19.84 --> 00:25:26.16 most dangerous and he says the most dangerous and most interesting missions we flew were missions
00:25:26.16 --> 00:25:33.04 72 and that was sog support. We called it going over the fence. For me personally this is why
00:25:33.04 --> 00:25:38.000 joined the Marine Corps to run special missions against the enemy. I was looking for adventure
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.92 and wanted to be where the action was. The Marine Aviators were told to prepare for a mission
00:25:43.92 --> 00:25:51.84 72 insertion deep into Louss. Gro replaced the 50 caliber machine gun with the M60 because it
00:25:51.84 --> 00:25:58.88 gave him more maneuverability and if we got shot down he said and quote if we got shot down I could
00:25:58.88 --> 00:26:03.92 carry it and take the flight to the enemy. The 50 was too heavy to carry. Is that a great Marine
00:26:03.92 --> 00:26:08.72 O'Wild? Yeah. So just so everyone understands what we're talking about. A 50 caliber machine gun
00:26:08.72 --> 00:26:16.16 is a big gun and you can't shoot it. You can't you can't carry that thing and shoot it from your
00:26:16.16 --> 00:26:22.16 shoulder from your hip. It's meant to be mounted on a vehicle or mounted a necrath. But in M60
00:26:22.16 --> 00:26:28.40 you can't shoot by yourself. You can carry it and you can fire it from the hip or from the shoulder.
00:26:28.40 --> 00:26:34.16 And so this Marine's thinking well we're going out these freaking saw guys. Probably a pretty decent
00:26:34.16 --> 00:26:38.24 chance we're going to get shot down. I'll go ahead and switch it out that way if we get shot down.
00:26:38.24 --> 00:26:42.40 I'll be able to you know unhook that thing and go and fight.
00:26:43.20 --> 00:26:47.20 You'll allow us to think of Marine boy. He's something. He's one of my all-time heroes
00:26:47.20 --> 00:26:56.64 from this mission. Yeah. Not far away from HMH463 at Marvel Mountain Air Facility Marine Aviators
00:26:56.64 --> 00:27:04.96 from HML 367 Scarface got the op order for Operation Tailwind in a more dramatic fashion according
00:27:04.96 --> 00:27:13.28 to Cobra Gunship pilot Joe Driscoll who is a first lieutenant at the time. And he says
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:18.000 the duty driver came by our room at two or three o'clock in the morning and told us to pack our
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.16 gear as we'd be gone for five to ten days on an operation to be ready at 5 a.m. My first thought was
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:29.60 maybe we're finally going into North Vietnam. Driscoll and fellow pilots flew the early model
00:27:30.16 --> 00:27:37.60 H1G Cobra Gunships with one man sitting in front seat and a pilot sitting behind him. A relative
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:43.44 of the more familiar Huey helicopter the Cobra Gunship had a man more narrow profile design strictly
00:27:43.44 --> 00:27:52.08 as a weapons platform. Driscoll Cobra had two 19 shot 2.75 rocket launchers, two seven shot
00:27:52.08 --> 00:27:57.36 rocket pods, one seven six two mini gun that fired six thousand rounds a minute and a grenade
00:27:57.36 --> 00:28:02.96 launcher that fired 40 millimeter high explosive rounds. That's why they call it a gunship.
00:28:04.56 --> 00:28:09.12 That's firepower. When the early versions of those Cobra's were fully armed and loaded with
00:28:09.12 --> 00:28:14.000 aviation fuel the helicopters skids would drag on the runway for a shirt distance until the
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.84 pilots gained enough lift to get the bird airborne. However, once once in the air, they brought the
00:28:19.84 --> 00:28:25.60 fight to the enemy with precise gun runs and rocket runs. Scarface and several other marine
00:28:25.60 --> 00:28:29.76 helicopter units have been involved in the Secret War and Vietnam for several years,
00:28:29.76 --> 00:28:39.12 usually supporting recon teams and hatchet forces from FOB1 at FOOBI and FOB3 at K-SON or FOB4 at Denang.
00:28:41.44 --> 00:28:45.44 In the northern and you're just this section of the book is laying out and I'm skipping through
00:28:45.44 --> 00:28:49.60 it like I always have to skip through some stuff, get it, get the book so you can get the
00:28:49.60 --> 00:28:54.64 rest of the details. But you know, you mentioned that this was a massive joint operation through
00:28:54.64 --> 00:28:59.12 all these different forces and in this section you're laying out the various air platforms
00:28:59.12 --> 00:29:04.96 that are going to be brought to bear to execute this mission. You go on here in the northern
00:29:04.96 --> 00:29:11.36 side of Denang at the Joint Military Civilian Airfield Air Force Spad Pilots who flew the
00:29:11.36 --> 00:29:18.56 single wing, single wing A1 sky Raiders received their initial operator for Operation Tailwind.
00:29:18.56 --> 00:29:28.56 So the A1 sky Raiders this old school World War II era, right, invented and put together
00:29:28.56 --> 00:29:35.92 at the end of World War II used to help Korean War and then the Air Force Brass put them all away
00:29:36.80 --> 00:29:41.84 and then Jack Singlov and other Commanders said we want those aircraft back in servers
00:29:41.84 --> 00:29:45.84 and they had this big battle behind the scenes that get the sky Raiders because they were just
00:29:45.84 --> 00:29:54.48 phenomenal support for Sog. The nickname Spad World War I. I looked it up. It's an old World War
00:29:54.48 --> 00:30:00.48 one airplane and it's the one such an ancient beast that they called it the Spad, the World War
00:30:00.48 --> 00:30:08.000 One Airplane. Awesome looking bird. Going on here. The single, the single engine war
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.48 plane was loved by American ground pounders. This is kind of like the A10. Oh yeah, you know,
00:30:12.48 --> 00:30:17.04 the A10 is the same thing. People trying to get rid of it and all the ground pounders say we love
00:30:17.04 --> 00:30:21.68 that thing. Absolutely love that world. The only thing the A10 with Missy was Napomp. Yeah, that would have been nice.
00:30:21.68 --> 00:30:28.08 Oh yeah. Chris McCridot. The single engine war plane was loved by American ground pounders and
00:30:28.08 --> 00:30:32.64 feared by communist troops because of the havoc and death they rained down on enemy troops.
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:39.04 Additionally, through the unique design by Ed Heineman at Douglas Aircraft Company during World
00:30:39.04 --> 00:30:44.72 War II, the Skyrader could stay on station over a target longer than any aircraft and it brought
00:30:44.72 --> 00:30:53.44 bombs, cluster bombs, 2.75 rockets, 20 millimeter cannons and two mini guns to the battlefield.
00:30:53.44 --> 00:30:57.20 Once again, that's a lot of firepower. Plus bombs and Napomp.
00:31:00.24 --> 00:31:04.80 Over the years, several Sog recon and hatchet four screened arrays were called getting
00:31:04.80 --> 00:31:10.32 shawered with set shell casings from the A1 skyraders as they flew danger close to the teams.
00:31:10.32 --> 00:31:14.48 They were supporting. Some later reported receiving burns on the back of their necks from hot
00:31:14.48 --> 00:31:19.12 shell casings that fell from the war bird and landed on the soldier's necks, burning their
00:31:19.12 --> 00:31:24.48 skin once they lodged in the collar. However, no one ever complained about those burns,
00:31:24.48 --> 00:31:31.04 burns that were often life savings, life saving. Lieutenant Colonel Melvin Swanson was the group commander.
00:31:31.04 --> 00:31:36.96 When Operation Tailwind, Op Order landed on his desk. And here's what he had to say.
00:31:36.96 --> 00:31:41.20 To tell the truth, we didn't do anything special when the Op Order came down. I had no idea
00:31:41.20 --> 00:31:46.40 where we were going. We operated like any other Sog mission that we'd supported over the years.
00:31:46.40 --> 00:31:52.64 We had two A1s armed and cocked ready to go for Sog missions and search and rescue missions.
00:31:52.64 --> 00:31:58.08 We provided ourselves on saving Sog teams. Sog missions were our primary assignment
00:31:58.08 --> 00:32:04.88 with Saur as the other priority. When they called, we answered. Always.
00:32:08.72 --> 00:32:14.96 Back at CCC and Con'tume, McCarley, restated the mission to his platoon leaders and squad leaders.
00:32:16.40 --> 00:32:23.84 Go heavy on ammo, grenades, and C4 plastic explosives, and light on food and water.
00:32:23.84 --> 00:32:31.68 And he says, I had every team member including our Indiged Troops Carriot least one pound a C4,
00:32:31.68 --> 00:32:37.60 because we were going to blow up any enemy caches and structures we found, and C4 was always
00:32:37.60 --> 00:32:44.88 good for clearing LZs. Greenberry medic Gary Mike Rose went through his mental checklist,
00:32:44.88 --> 00:32:49.20 preparing to carry enough medical supplies and bandages for a company sized operation.
00:32:49.20 --> 00:32:54.40 He would make sure that each greenberry team member carried at least one more fiends
00:32:54.40 --> 00:32:59.52 threat in a specific pocket. He also made sure that he packed that each packed several
00:32:59.52 --> 00:33:05.20 sizes of bandages and at least one IV. He packed about 15 serets of more fiend,
00:33:05.52 --> 00:33:11.44 five serets of atropine. He always carried five for insert and snake bites even in camp,
00:33:11.44 --> 00:33:17.12 as well as extra bandages, medical tape, rubber tubing, and several NATO surgical kits.
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:25.92 Rose worked with his mononyard, Cache. Is that right? Cache? Cache? Cache? Who he described has a
00:33:25.92 --> 00:33:31.12 loyal brave soldier and medic who carried a similar amount of medical supplies that I carried.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.92 And like many young soldiers rose never thought for a minute that he would be wounded during combat.
00:33:39.28 --> 00:33:45.44 Thus the stage was set for launching Operation Tailwind on September 11, 1970,
00:33:45.44 --> 00:33:51.28 after several weather delays and rocket attacks to the launch site north of CCC.
00:33:52.24 --> 00:33:58.48 It would be a mission where the 16 greenberries would receive a total of 33 purple
00:33:58.48 --> 00:34:03.60 hearts for wounds received during the heavy combat that was about to unfold in louss.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000 Oh yeah. And the fun thing here is we this is the first time we were able to
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.44 interview all the aviors like Mel Swanson, one character, and then Joe, Driscoll, and his cohorts
00:34:21.44 --> 00:34:29.28 from Scarface and then Met Larry and a couple of other, it's on the pilots over time.
00:34:29.28 --> 00:34:33.04 Yeah and we'll get to it because you mentioned in the book and you talk through that, but a lot of
00:34:33.04 --> 00:34:36.72 times you'd never even see these guys. Never. I mean there are stations in different places. They're
00:34:36.72 --> 00:34:41.60 up in the air, you're on the ground and you never, you never meet them. Never. And look at me,
00:34:41.60 --> 00:34:47.20 you've heard all the stories, my and limb black, defrenchment, Elton Bores, well, we all have
00:34:47.20 --> 00:34:51.76 SkyReader stories that love and say they're bacon, I couldn't tell you one pilot's name.
00:34:51.76 --> 00:34:57.60 Until we had to story. And that was even there at 45 years later.
00:35:02.64 --> 00:35:07.52 So here we go. Let's get to it. After seven days of weather delays, fall starts in enemy rocket attacks
00:35:07.52 --> 00:35:14.64 at the top secret military assistance command base in Vietnam.
00:35:17.20 --> 00:35:22.64 Eugene McCarley, that's the the guy in charge. Eugene McCarley gave the order to move out.
00:35:23.36 --> 00:35:28.48 15 Bres, 15 Green Bres, and 120 Monn Yards mercenaries.
00:35:28.48 --> 00:35:37.52 On the morning of September 11th, four of the powerful Marine Corps CH 53 D. S. Corsky Twin
00:35:37.52 --> 00:35:44.72 engine helicopters in H.M. H. 463, based at the Marine Corps marble mountain air facility,
00:35:44.72 --> 00:35:51.12 it landed outside the CCC compound and loaded up the 136 man unit. Sog Brass had turned to the
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:57.20 Marine Corps aviation wing that flew the largest troop carriers to reach into Louss, 25 kilometers
00:35:57.20 --> 00:36:03.84 beyond the normal Sog area of operations. S. Corsky Twin escorted by six Marine Corps
00:36:03.84 --> 00:36:09.84 Cobra's, the helicopters headed north to Refuel at back to before heading into the target area.
00:36:09.84 --> 00:36:15.04 After refueling, they flew north parallel to the border for a while before taking a left turn,
00:36:15.04 --> 00:36:21.20 heading west into the target area. Could the Cobra's make it all the way in? Yes. That's pretty impressive.
00:36:21.20 --> 00:36:28.24 Yeah, they had actually fuel capacity got it. And here's a speaking of the pilots that you got to
00:36:28.24 --> 00:36:34.64 interview. It was a hot zone from the moment we arrived. Scarface Cobra pilot Joe Driscoll said,
00:36:34.64 --> 00:36:40.72 we took several hits on the first gun run. During the insertion of the team Scarface pilot
00:36:40.72 --> 00:36:46.96 Sid Baker and I were surprised by the volume of fire. In fact, we took hits in our rocket pods.
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:52.88 We had bullet holes in our tail boom and they shot out our radio. When the Cobra's made their final
00:36:52.88 --> 00:36:58.16 gun run, we followed our SOP, which was sustained formation and keeping eye out for enemy soldiers firing
00:36:58.16 --> 00:37:04.72 at us. And quote, because they had no radio contact, Driscoll and Baker simply flew through
00:37:04.72 --> 00:37:08.56 flew through the pattern to cover the ship in front of them without firing.
00:37:09.44 --> 00:37:16.16 quote, the enemy didn't know we had no radios. I'll tell you one thing that was a hot target
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:22.56 Driscoll said, we were moving targets. The CH53s were static targets, but they went in,
00:37:22.56 --> 00:37:29.44 dropped off the troops and got out of their post-haste. Man. Yeah, on insert.
00:37:30.32 --> 00:37:35.76 I see, ordinarily we're done. We get shot at going in unless you're limb black and his ones
00:37:35.76 --> 00:37:42.16 you're out of it. But ordinarily you're done. You just turn around and go home. We're compromised.
00:37:42.16 --> 00:37:47.84 The idea is to get inserted, do a mission without being compromised. There by our old standards,
00:37:47.84 --> 00:37:54.56 we're compromised. Operation tailwind, we're going in. Come hell or high water. It gets better.
00:37:54.56 --> 00:38:02.16 Oh yeah. Continuing the CH53s were big targets. McCarly said, all of the CH53s were hit by
00:38:02.16 --> 00:38:07.84 enemy ground fire wall and rout to the target. I'd never received so much ground fire while
00:38:07.84 --> 00:38:13.28 flying to a target. He said, it sounded like a BB gun shooting a tin can, but it wasn't BBs that
00:38:13.28 --> 00:38:18.40 the troops heard it was enemy rounds. By the time that B company exited the helicopters
00:38:18.40 --> 00:38:23.04 four-month yards had been wounded from enemy gunfire, one died while flying back to base
00:38:23.76 --> 00:38:30.96 with his three wounded comrades. Greenbrake, medic, sergeant, Michael Rose added. It was strange
00:38:30.96 --> 00:38:36.56 exiting the chopper stepping over wounded in action to get to the ground.
00:38:36.56 --> 00:38:42.40 Yeah. So they haven't even started the mission yet. They got one killed and three wounded. We haven't
00:38:42.40 --> 00:38:50.32 started the mission yet, but we got we got three wounded and one killed. Continuing under ordinary
00:38:50.32 --> 00:38:56.72 sag mission SOPs, any recon team or hatchet force that received enemy ground fire and men wounded
00:38:56.72 --> 00:39:01.60 in action prior to getting to the ground would have canceled the mission. This was no ordinary
00:39:01.60 --> 00:39:08.32 mission. Company being moved off the helicopters and was on the ground in lousy shortly after noon time.
00:39:09.20 --> 00:39:15.12 One fundamental trueism of the Vietnam War as well as the eight years secret surface,
00:39:15.12 --> 00:39:20.08 the communist forces fought when they wanted to fight. Thus when McCarley and the Mani
00:39:20.08 --> 00:39:25.68 remaining 131 members of B company settled into the woodline, they found complete and utter silence.
00:39:25.68 --> 00:39:32.48 He said it was so strange. The aircraft pulled back, we were on the ground and there were no enemy
00:39:32.48 --> 00:39:37.76 soldiers, no noise, no birds, nothing. So once again you get that weird quietness.
00:39:37.76 --> 00:39:42.72 Oh yeah. What do you think make the NBA think we're going to shoot when they're inserting,
00:39:42.72 --> 00:39:46.88 but once they land, we're not going to do anything. What do they think? What's the enemy thinking
00:39:46.88 --> 00:39:52.80 at that point? Who knows? They're tactics always varied and I think a little bit was just a
00:39:52.80 --> 00:39:56.88 complete element of surprise. They thought of birds and so the people shooting at would be
00:39:56.88 --> 00:40:01.92 anti-aircraft crews along the way and probably some ground troops for the AKs. I don't know.
00:40:01.92 --> 00:40:08.72 I wasn't there. But once they land, let's see what the boys are up to. That's what the NBA
00:40:08.72 --> 00:40:14.64 could be thinking just to see what and then they knew with those three helicopters coming in.
00:40:14.64 --> 00:40:21.60 There's a lot of people and they wanted to maybe do their own assessment. See, who they are and
00:40:21.60 --> 00:40:28.08 what they're up to because sometimes the NBA just did react as quickly, particularly that
00:40:28.08 --> 00:40:34.80 far west. They were never actually surprised at a several levels. Surprise that we were there,
00:40:34.80 --> 00:40:41.44 or sod was there and then surprised at the number of aircraft and that they actually got in.
00:40:42.32 --> 00:40:47.44 And so there's all three different elements, but you know they're checking it out.
00:40:47.44 --> 00:40:49.44 Mm-hmm.
00:40:51.12 --> 00:40:55.36 Continuing on, McCarthy, who was serving a second tour of duty in sag, wasted no time. The company
00:40:55.36 --> 00:41:00.16 moved out in the northwest direction and then the men of B company had another surprise.
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:05.04 Surprise. After moving less than 400 meters from the LZ, the point element of the company
00:41:05.04 --> 00:41:11.60 reported seeing huts. The first platoon deployed two squads to search the area. They found an
00:41:11.60 --> 00:41:18.08 enemy ammo dump 20 bunkers spread out over 500 meters hidden in the under the jungle canopy with
00:41:18.08 --> 00:41:23.76 vegetation and dark covers. After setting up perimeter security, the B company troops pulled together
00:41:23.76 --> 00:41:29.52 a quick inventory of what they had found picked up samples. While demolitions experts,
00:41:30.16 --> 00:41:35.12 as Sergeant First Class Bernard Bright and specialist fifth class Craig Schmidt,
00:41:35.12 --> 00:41:40.56 photographed identified the weapons and ammo and began setting up explosive charges with 13.
00:41:40.56 --> 00:41:46.56 And a half minute delay fuses in the two larger structures with white phosphorus grenades attached
00:41:46.56 --> 00:41:51.84 to each charge to better mark the exact location for Kavi who had then direct air strikes on that
00:41:51.84 --> 00:41:58.72 position. So here we go. Already on the ground, already found bad guy area, but there was no bad
00:41:58.72 --> 00:42:04.80 guys there for whatever reason, but a bunch of ammo and whatnot. They found a cash. So they're going to
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:12.40 blow it up and then this happens. While the B company team worked on this cash, McCarley had one of
00:42:12.40 --> 00:42:20.48 the most unique moments in its 28 years of military service. As he and a few of the SF soldiers
00:42:20.48 --> 00:42:27.12 were looking at a map, a telephone rang. Quote, I couldn't believe it. A phone rang in the middle
00:42:27.12 --> 00:42:34.72 of the house. McCarley said, quote, so being SF, one of our guys picked up the phone and answered it.
00:42:34.72 --> 00:42:41.04 Hello, fifth special forces group may we help you. Did you imagine the reaction of the communist
00:42:41.04 --> 00:42:45.92 on the other end of that phone to this day just thinking about it makes me laugh? So there you go.
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:52.64 Yeah. As the SF men chuckled at the phone call, others were compiling an impressive list of
00:42:52.64 --> 00:43:01.68 enemy weapons contained in the bunkers. Massive cash of weapons. Not resting on its laurels,
00:43:01.68 --> 00:43:06.80 B company moved north with a platoon with the first platoon breaking point in a short distance
00:43:06.80 --> 00:43:11.60 to first platoon found a trail. Crossed it were proceeding north. When a dare and second platoon
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:17.28 squad leader Mike Hagen observed several NVA soldiers on the trail and opened fire on them.
00:43:17.28 --> 00:43:24.24 An NVA 762 round went through Hagen's gas mask, which he had on his leg and slammed into his
00:43:24.24 --> 00:43:29.12 legs so they're carrying gas mask on this operation. Bernie Bright was slightly wounded.
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:34.08 The round actually parted his hair said McCarley, you can't get much closer than that.
00:43:34.08 --> 00:43:39.84 The NVA fled the area and B company continued to head north after medic Gary Mike Rose
00:43:40.48 --> 00:43:45.60 patched up Hagen's wound. As they marched they heard two large explosions back at the NVA
00:43:45.60 --> 00:43:51.28 bunkers. White phosphorus grenades, that bright and smith attached to the demo charges emitted
00:43:51.28 --> 00:43:56.40 large plumes of white smoke, smoke that covey readily picked up and proceeded to direct precise
00:43:56.40 --> 00:44:01.76 follow-up air strikes. Secondary explosions would continue for more than five hours.
00:44:03.28 --> 00:44:06.64 Can you imagine that? Secondary explosions? Crazy.
00:44:09.04 --> 00:44:13.92 Yeah, crazy amount of, well I mean this is their supply, this is how they're fighting the war.
00:44:13.92 --> 00:44:18.16 Right there you go home and say look what we just did. They'd be a great mission.
00:44:18.16 --> 00:44:20.72 That's the first but hour on the ground.
00:44:23.12 --> 00:44:30.000 B company then made contact with the NVA company, which lasted for close to an hour McCarley said.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.80 The hatchet force men use close air strikes from Scarface Cobras and spads skillful squad
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:41.28 tacked and skillful squad tactics against the surprise the NVA to drive them off.
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:46.32 As Darkness approached McCarley and the point element began looking for location to remain
00:44:46.32 --> 00:44:53.84 overnight for the night. We stopped for a combo check when they fired one B-40 rocket into our
00:44:53.84 --> 00:45:02.96 command post. Rose added we were fortunate we were fortunate in one small way. The rocket flew past
00:45:02.96 --> 00:45:08.96 all of us before striking a bamboo thicket, thus when the shrapnel exploded, those of us injured
00:45:08.96 --> 00:45:14.88 didn't get the full head on blunt force of the metal shards as the Ford momentum of the rocket
00:45:14.88 --> 00:45:21.28 exploded into the bamboo. 45 years later after that rocket explosion rose had one lasting
00:45:21.28 --> 00:45:27.04 mental image of it. He says quote it's funny I can't remember much about it except that all the
00:45:27.04 --> 00:45:32.48 sudden I was flying through the air. At some point while airborne I looked up and saw a blue sky.
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:42.16 It was beautiful and then I landed. And here's McCarley rose showed us what he was made of that day.
00:45:42.16 --> 00:45:46.24 He immediately started to go to work on the wounded because everyone in the CP at that time had
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:51.20 varying degrees of wounds. In fact Rose had a serious foot injury. Somehow the shrapnel had
00:45:51.20 --> 00:45:55.12 sliced open his jungle boot and cut into his foot. What did he do? He pulled out an ace
00:45:55.12 --> 00:45:59.68 bandage wrapped it around his foot and used his car 15 as a crutch and began treating our wounded.
00:45:59.68 --> 00:46:07.76 And the quote the most serious wounded was a south-viewed and amoees lieutenant. Shrapnel sliced
00:46:07.76 --> 00:46:12.40 into his right thigh to the bone in addition to other shrapnel wounds. We stopped and
00:46:12.40 --> 00:46:17.76 looked our wounds as Rose passed patched up our people McCarley said. McCarley's plan was to continue
00:46:17.76 --> 00:46:22.64 to move at night and if B company made contact with the enemy the special forces men would determine
00:46:22.64 --> 00:46:26.48 whether to attack them or maneuver around them or simply pull back and call and fix wing gun
00:46:26.48 --> 00:46:30.32 ships that could bring deadly fire from the sky upon the enemy troops on the ground.
00:46:32.40 --> 00:46:37.92 Fast forward a little bit. Finally, Rose rigged two stretchers from rubber poncho supported by thick
00:46:37.92 --> 00:46:43.60 bamboo poles and tied them down with six foot sections of rope. They would now be able to carry
00:46:43.60 --> 00:46:49.20 the most seriously wounded indigenous troops when Rose gave McCarley the okay. B company took the
00:46:49.20 --> 00:46:54.80 bold step of moving out at night. Quote, I wasn't going to let them tie us down in one position
00:46:54.80 --> 00:46:59.28 and then hammer us by us moving. They didn't know exactly where we were. There were little
00:46:59.28 --> 00:47:05.52 scirmishes and a few times we ran into a few NVA after contact we'd move on. If there was a larger
00:47:05.52 --> 00:47:10.72 element we could pull back and call in the gunship strike. We had flare ships over us every night.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.84 End quote, B company continued to march west deeper into laughs. The deeper B company green
00:47:19.84 --> 00:47:24.48 beret and their mountain yards headed west the more they enhanced their primary goal of being a
00:47:24.48 --> 00:47:32.72 diversion to the NVA forces attacking the CIA's operation catapult. This wasn't going to be easy.
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:39.84 By dawn, nine of the Americans, nine of the 16 Americans had been wounded. So these guys have
00:47:39.84 --> 00:47:49.68 been on the ground for what is it? They got inserted around noon. So we're talking of very short
00:47:49.68 --> 00:47:56.000 period of 18 hours. Yeah, 18 hours or something like that and they already have nine of the 16
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.32 Americans wounded. Rose and his indigenous medic, Cach, worked tirelessly on the wounded all
00:48:04.32 --> 00:48:09.36 might even as they moved throughout the dark jungle. So they got nine wounded just Americans
00:48:09.36 --> 00:48:14.80 and they're still moving. And the two seriously wounded, Montenegro. Yeah, in stretchers.
00:48:14.80 --> 00:48:23.28 And stretchers and provides. Yeah, man. Carrying stretchers is no joke. You need to have like a
00:48:23.28 --> 00:48:27.76 team to care if you think if you think, oh, just get two guys one on each side of the stretcher.
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:32.56 That works for a little while. But you end up having to either rotate those guys out or you put
00:48:32.56 --> 00:48:37.84 four guys on the stretcher so much harder than it looks. Now luckily the yards are smaller though,
00:48:37.84 --> 00:48:42.80 right? Yeah. They're not like the big of them. Man, when we when we were going through training
00:48:42.80 --> 00:48:50.56 and I was be a downman. The guys would be like, hey, bro. I love you, but could you go on a dive please?
00:48:50.56 --> 00:48:54.64 Take this grenade. It will see you later. Good luck. We'll mark you with a cam light.
00:49:00.48 --> 00:49:03.52 Continuing on, Captain G. McCarty had the men of
00:49:04.80 --> 00:49:10.08 B company hatchet force moving north well before the sun rose on day two of Operation Tailwind.
00:49:10.08 --> 00:49:14.96 We zigzagged a lot during that mission because we didn't want the NVA to get a good fix on our
00:49:14.96 --> 00:49:19.20 position as we knew they tried to pin us down and attack us in force if that happened.
00:49:19.20 --> 00:49:24.80 Said McCarty. Within an hour NVA soldiers hit the first platoon with automatic weapons,
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:29.76 B-40 rockets and mortars. Two squads maneuvered against the enemy while McCarty
00:49:29.76 --> 00:49:33.28 directed air strikes against the enemy positions that tactics work because of thick
00:49:33.28 --> 00:49:40.80 jungle they weren't able to get an accurate body count as McCarty continued to march north. However,
00:49:40.80 --> 00:49:47.84 SF, medic, Gary Mike Rose knew the casualties were climbing among both SF and in-did's troops
00:49:47.84 --> 00:49:55.04 of B company. We had two yards killed and yards of the short name for Montenegro. We had two yards
00:49:55.04 --> 00:49:59.36 killed when Captain McCarty and I got hit with Shrapnel from the B-40. After conforming,
00:49:59.36 --> 00:50:05.04 confirming they were dead, I wrapped them up and we carried them with us as best we could, Rose said.
00:50:05.76 --> 00:50:10.32 However, after trying to carry them while tending to the two most seriously injured men,
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:15.76 I quote, I had to make a decision to leave the two dead men behind because I could see that
00:50:15.76 --> 00:50:19.84 carrying them as we moved, we were causing too much fatigue for the living.
00:50:20.96 --> 00:50:26.56 So we made a decision that has bothered me for nearly half a century. By day two it seemed as though
00:50:26.56 --> 00:50:33.92 every day every hour I kept getting more and more wounded. So the SF medic rose, he's looking at
00:50:33.92 --> 00:50:39.92 the situation and we were just joking about how hard it is to carry guys and clearly he was dealing
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:47.12 with that. It's incredibly hard and you think like I said, it takes, you have to have guys to
00:50:47.12 --> 00:50:53.28 rotate through it's taking out a whole lot of your combat power when you're moving wounded. So
00:50:53.28 --> 00:50:59.36 they probably have probably takes 10 guys to move these two wounded guys maybe even more.
00:50:59.36 --> 00:51:03.92 So that's 10 guys out of the fight and you're moving slower and so he has to make this
00:51:03.92 --> 00:51:06.08 agonizing decision that we're going to leave these guys.
00:51:09.92 --> 00:51:16.80 When I talked to Mike for that part of the story, his eyes well done. It was just like yesterday.
00:51:16.80 --> 00:51:23.84 It really still hurt him. Now 50 years later. Yeah. Rough.
00:51:27.04 --> 00:51:31.92 Continue's on here at one point during an attack on B company and VA force of more than 40
00:51:31.92 --> 00:51:36.88 enemy soldiers. Two of the most seriously wounded men that rose was treating had both of their
00:51:36.88 --> 00:51:40.88 IV fluid bags shattered and destroyed during a hail of enemy gunfire.
00:51:40.88 --> 00:51:48.000 I learned to lesson right then and there said rose. We kept the IVs flowing from low positions
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.16 allowing gravity to work but not high enough for the enemy gunfire to destroy them.
00:51:52.16 --> 00:51:58.08 Were you guys using IV bag? Were your IV's glass? That's a good question. I forget.
00:51:58.08 --> 00:52:03.20 Okay. That's for the medics of the Kamagai. Yeah. Well the weird that well we all carry
00:52:03.20 --> 00:52:11.84 IVs and we ended up getting small IVs but I don't know if he said the IVs shattered. So that makes
00:52:11.84 --> 00:52:17.60 me think maybe they were made of glass. What the bag? IV bags. Yeah. Just like your big jars.
00:52:17.60 --> 00:52:24.40 Yeah. Oh no there for our medics they had plastic. Okay. So maybe because they're I'll
00:52:24.40 --> 00:52:34.32 not show it to Hatchiforce. He took what he had. Yep. That'd be my assumption. So you're treating
00:52:34.32 --> 00:52:39.44 your wounded. You're giving them IV and the freaking bags or the jar gets shot at. Yeah.
00:52:40.88 --> 00:52:45.20 Continuing on as the Hatchiforce moved north it was obvious to Macarly that rose had his hands
00:52:45.20 --> 00:52:49.84 full as he continually as he had to continually monitor two most seriously wounded men.
00:52:49.84 --> 00:52:53.76 Men who were being carried by him and other team members and structures made of bamboo sticks
00:52:53.76 --> 00:52:58.80 and ponchos because they were so many wounded Macarly directed B company to find or make an
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:05.04 LZ for a medivac to land and take out the wounded. They found a large bomb crater and began
00:53:05.04 --> 00:53:10.48 preparing the LZ when the enemy initiated two successive contacts with them. Sfiring small
00:53:10.48 --> 00:53:16.56 arms before the rockets and throwing chycom grenades as they worked to on establishing a clearing
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:22.000 B company dealt with the two separate attacks from the NVA using squad tactics and attack air.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.48 Both the attacks were neutralized only to have Covey report that the weather had turned bad
00:53:26.48 --> 00:53:33.92 prohibiting any rescue attempts for the day. Without hesitation B company moved moved out again
00:53:33.92 --> 00:53:38.24 going west for a while then north keeping its pattern of movement unpredictable.
00:53:39.84 --> 00:53:44.96 What I remember most about day two of Operation Tailwind was the disappointment of having the
00:53:44.96 --> 00:53:51.68 weather turned bad preventing a much needed medivac. Macarly said, so these guys have the goal
00:53:51.68 --> 00:53:55.60 like okay we got we got some wounded guys we need to get these guys out of here they fight
00:53:55.60 --> 00:54:02.32 to get it get an LZ once they get this LZ established under attack they push the attack back
00:54:02.32 --> 00:54:07.44 and then the weather rolls in and the guys can't guys can't fly. How these days your weather
00:54:08.56 --> 00:54:13.60 is there what's your what's your confidence on the weather predictions?
00:54:16.48 --> 00:54:19.68 Like the weather predictions and Iraq are pretty easy it's going to be hot.
00:54:19.68 --> 00:54:26.64 Every once in a while you would get a storm and we had some sandstorms.
00:54:26.64 --> 00:54:32.72 Oh I saw them. The sandstorms they're they're like biblical sandstorms. Oh yeah they blacken the
00:54:32.72 --> 00:54:39.76 sky it's pretty cool to see but you can't run off send them at all like you can't make communications
00:54:39.76 --> 00:54:47.68 because the sand blocks radio waves. So basically if there's that kind of biblical sandstorm coming
00:54:47.68 --> 00:54:52.000 everyone just kind of stands down now you can go out and try and get into a good position
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.36 but you can't see anything you can see you know maybe maybe 20 yards or something like that
00:54:59.36 --> 00:55:04.64 I mean you visibility just gone. Oh yeah but we could kind of know that they were coming.
00:55:04.64 --> 00:55:11.04 I never got let me put this way I never got surprised by the weather in Iraq. It was
00:55:11.04 --> 00:55:18.64 there was sunny and hot 99% of the time. Every once in a while there'd be some kind of cloud
00:55:18.64 --> 00:55:23.76 maybe a little bit of precipitation by because we were by the fridies with river where it was
00:55:23.76 --> 00:55:29.28 it was human people who know that by the fridies rivers freaking human and I'm going to show
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:36.08 you pictures sometime of this area to the to the north east of the city of Vermont it was still
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:45.36 in our in our AO and it was called the MC one or the one MC but what we called it was
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:51.76 Viet Ram because because it looked like Viet No. Yeah. They looked exactly like Viet No.
00:55:51.76 --> 00:55:56.16 Palm trees, rice patties, dikes. My steps on told me about it.
00:55:56.16 --> 00:56:00.72 This is in the green zone. Yep. Yep. It's like I thought it was back in Viet No.
00:56:00.72 --> 00:56:06.56 With you. Always seeing the green zone in Afghanistan? No. Oh, in Iraq. And by green zone he
00:56:06.56 --> 00:56:12.000 means areas where there was the we was called the green zone was the biggest most secure area in
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.48 Iraq. Okay. So you're talking about the green zone in Baghdad. And Baghdad. Okay. Yeah. And he was
00:56:16.48 --> 00:56:22.80 operating southeast and different locations for near some of which they came into Iraq. He juggle.
00:56:22.80 --> 00:56:27.36 Yep. In Afghanistan they call the green zone. Yeah. Like areas where there's areas where
00:56:27.36 --> 00:56:33.20 they're like heavily folk. There's a lot of foliage. Right. Okay. So in Iraq the green zone is
00:56:33.20 --> 00:56:37.28 the green zone. It's the thing right there in Baghdad, which is big and secure. It's where they
00:56:37.28 --> 00:56:43.28 had good food and all that stuff. Yeah. We never had any sandstorms in the jungle. So maybe
00:56:43.28 --> 00:56:47.68 a Thai food or two. So my question was when you would get a weather prediction, you're going to go
00:56:47.68 --> 00:56:53.04 like these guys, let's say you were going on a four-day mission. And they're telling you,
00:56:53.04 --> 00:56:57.84 all right, looks like the weather is good. How good did you feel about that? Like did you give it
00:56:57.84 --> 00:57:02.64 50 or 50? Yeah. You've figured what that was. It's figured because it could change so quickly.
00:57:03.20 --> 00:57:07.68 But the positive thing is that if it gets cloudy, how long is that? How long are you thinking that
00:57:07.68 --> 00:57:15.84 last four? Oh, you know, every time was different. Um, could the clouds a lot of time to be clouds
00:57:15.84 --> 00:57:21.76 in the morning? Sometimes they burn all sometimes they wouldn't. And there's just so much moisture around.
00:57:21.76 --> 00:57:31.84 And we're always jogging with the weather. I'm just one of the factors that just no control.
00:57:31.84 --> 00:57:39.60 We get predictions. But we got sucked in a couple times. And again, they wanted to get us into a
00:57:39.60 --> 00:57:45.60 hole. So okay, we just go up and try to get into a target and get in and then mother nature closes
00:57:45.60 --> 00:57:53.92 the hole. So like, it was just that the lie love and waited out. Wait it out because if you move
00:57:53.92 --> 00:57:58.72 and make make contact, there's no support. And the NVA know that. That's what really really
00:57:58.72 --> 00:58:03.76 come at you. Hard to do is no air. So they love it when there's bad weather. Oh, sure.
00:58:05.52 --> 00:58:09.44 Oh, yes. The air weather was the NVA's ally.
00:58:09.44 --> 00:58:18.96 All right. Fighting them and VA fighting the weather. Mother nature. It's a night mother nature.
00:58:18.96 --> 00:58:23.52 It's another day at Sog. Back to the book. Night two and Louss was similar to night one.
00:58:23.52 --> 00:58:27.92 B company kept on the move with continued support from moon beam, linking the team with shadow,
00:58:27.92 --> 00:58:34.16 stinger, and specter gunships throughout the night. During that night, we heard track vehicles.
00:58:34.16 --> 00:58:39.52 We heard trucks Macarley said. Night two sounded like a lot of trucks heading south, bringing troops
00:58:39.52 --> 00:58:45.76 and supplies south, and some to deal with us. We had skirmishes that night and we directed air assets
00:58:45.76 --> 00:58:53.60 to assist us directly and to the areas where we heard motor vehicle activity. So now you got the
00:58:53.60 --> 00:58:59.12 specter gunships, common at night, which is a beautiful thing. What I had all three variations
00:58:59.12 --> 00:59:07.52 because you know, when I first get there in 68, spooky was the first one. And then they came out with
00:59:07.52 --> 00:59:15.68 shadow, which was a C119, where a spooky was the old C47, and they could have maybe two
00:59:15.68 --> 00:59:23.12 ring guns. And when they came out with the shadow, could we have one of our recon teams said,
00:59:23.12 --> 00:59:26.96 they came back, they lived through the night, and they went through a couple of shadows,
00:59:26.96 --> 00:59:32.56 and they had more orders, make it stay on station longer, and then another team, a couple
00:59:32.56 --> 00:59:36.96 months later, or maybe you're off to get the time frame, then it was a stingers. Again,
00:59:36.96 --> 00:59:44.08 C119s, with the weapons, the computers, the lock-in on the strobe light, and then specter.
00:59:45.12 --> 00:59:49.92 And 50 years later, it's still dominate the night. Yeah, that thing is a beautiful piece of machinery.
00:59:49.92 --> 01:00:02.24 The NVA also inflicted some more casualties in the company. By the time McCarley moved out at
01:00:02.24 --> 01:00:09.76 4am for day three, September 13th, 1970, Rose was tending to more than 30 wounded men.
01:00:11.36 --> 01:00:15.84 Two with deadly serious wounds that required almost constant attention, fluid rejuvenation,
01:00:15.84 --> 01:00:20.88 and pain management. By that time Rose was also running low on bandages, ivies, and morphine
01:00:20.88 --> 01:00:21.44 serets.
01:00:22.72 --> 01:00:28.24 Quote, we were so low on morphine that I reused morphine serets, which is a no-no-under normal
01:00:28.24 --> 01:00:33.20 circumstances, but there was nothing normal about this operation, so I would give two or three
01:00:33.20 --> 01:00:38.000 of the wounded morphine from the same seret. I only gave them enough to dull the pain,
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000 but allowed them to be somewhat alert.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.84 And Quote. As Rose focused on the wounded, the first platoon engaged the enemy as they moved
01:00:47.84 --> 01:00:53.20 toward a potential LZ for a much needed meta-vac, while the third platoon deployed one squad to
01:00:53.20 --> 01:00:58.64 maintain contact with another squad of NVA attacking the company's rear. After several gun runs
01:00:58.64 --> 01:01:05.36 by Scarface and A1 skyrators from denying in Thailand, the rear action force rejoined the company
01:01:05.36 --> 01:01:12.24 as it pushed into a good LZ site and began clearing trees with clay more mines and C4 plastic
01:01:12.24 --> 01:01:13.04 explosives.
01:01:16.08 --> 01:01:22.24 At noon after Scarface and the spads performed gun runs on enemy positions near a small LZ,
01:01:22.24 --> 01:01:28.88 the first Marine Corps 53D approached the LZ. As the large helicopter descended into the LZ,
01:01:28.88 --> 01:01:33.84 the pilot Bill Beardall was concerned that the LZ might not be large enough to land in.
01:01:33.84 --> 01:01:40.24 As he maneuvered the chopper slowly downward, Rose moved toward the rear tailgate of the CH53
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:44.72 with his most seriously injured soldier, the South Vietnamese lieutenant with the horrific
01:01:44.72 --> 01:01:51.92 thigh and hip injury. Inside the chopper SF-Medics John, staff sergeant John Dock-Padget
01:01:51.92 --> 01:01:57.28 and sergeant John Brown moved onto the back tailgate as it lowered with Brown supporting
01:01:57.28 --> 01:02:03.52 Paget by holding his belt. I was trying to reach the patient that Mike was lifting towards us
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:08.16 and just at that moment in time the pilot pulled pitch and lifted to the left.
01:02:09.76 --> 01:02:16.32 And quote, Rose said quote, the tail rotor struck a tree as I was lifting the patient up towards Dock.
01:02:16.96 --> 01:02:23.36 The chopper lifted upward suddenly. As it was lifting up, it took enemy small arms fire and a
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:34.24 B-40 rocket hit. And quote, Paget said quote, when that B-40 hit us, it went through the fuel cell
01:02:34.24 --> 01:02:41.36 but didn't explode. There was aviation fuel everywhere. How it didn't ignite, I'll never know,
01:02:41.36 --> 01:02:50.96 but surely God was riding with us. And quote, bear doll pilot of the CH53 radioed Mayday,
01:02:50.96 --> 01:02:56.64 Mayday, we're going in as the CH53 began losing fuel in its hydraulic fuel,
01:02:56.64 --> 01:03:02.56 few fluids. Why H14, that's the number of this particular CH53,
01:03:02.56 --> 01:03:05.76 crashed without any injuries to the Medix or crew members who immediately
01:03:05.76 --> 01:03:11.28 exited the wounded bird and set up a defensive perimeter with Paget overseeing the impromptu
01:03:11.28 --> 01:03:19.12 team on the ground. As the NCOIC for SOGCC dispensary at Kahn Tum,
01:03:19.12 --> 01:03:26.80 Paget could have pulled rank and stayed behind. And he said quote, but that wasn't how I did
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:33.36 things. I usually took my turn riding on the Chase medic ship. So here you have a guy that's a
01:03:33.36 --> 01:03:40.08 senior guy that could have been sitting back in the in the in the Hooch air condition in the air
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:45.84 condition, who's pooch back on base, but he's he's not that kind of leader. No, not at all steps
01:03:45.84 --> 01:03:50.24 up and gets in there. And now these guys are getting shot down. Maybe he's questioning
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:55.28 that decision right now. Oh, I'm sure he was. He made that set up for the record. But
01:03:55.28 --> 01:04:03.44 talks a smart guy. Figure all the angles. As they set up their perimeter scar face lieutenant,
01:04:03.44 --> 01:04:12.88 H E Newton called CH53 aircraft number Y H 20 piloted by Mark McKenzie met them at a rally point
01:04:12.88 --> 01:04:18.32 and led them to the crash site where Scarface and Spads made gun runs in preparation for the
01:04:18.32 --> 01:04:24.64 Chase medic aircraft called Sard by them by the Marines to arrive for the down, downed crew and
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:35.60 SF medics. While En route to rescue the crew of Y H 14 said Y H door gunner Larry Grow, I was
01:04:35.60 --> 01:04:40.64 admiring the beautiful countryside. And I couldn't help thinking of all the bad guys down there waiting
01:04:40.64 --> 01:04:46.16 for us. My M60 was lockloaded and ready for action. As we got closer to the pick up site, I could see
01:04:46.16 --> 01:04:51.36 that it was surrounded by smoke that was laid down by Scarface Cobras along with their rockets
01:04:51.36 --> 01:04:57.12 and 40 millimeters to protect the crew of the downtropper and quote. As Y H 20 was about to
01:04:57.12 --> 01:05:03.52 settle into a hover over the downed crew, an NVA 51 caliber anti aircraft heavy machine gun
01:05:03.52 --> 01:05:11.36 opened fire on the aircraft's left side. Grows left side window was only about 25 yards away from
01:05:11.36 --> 01:05:16.96 it. And the muzzle flashes from the gun were huge and the round seemed to be the size of basketballs.
01:05:17.52 --> 01:05:22.32 Grow pulled the trigger on his M60 and held it until the 51 cow was silenced.
01:05:23.44 --> 01:05:29.92 The CH53 started to bounce around and I knew quote and I knew we had taken some hits.
01:05:29.92 --> 01:05:35.44 Sergeant Whitmer was working his gun on the right side as Captain Kipola and Sergeant Spalding
01:05:35.44 --> 01:05:42.32 were at the rear ramp throwing out the 120 foot aluminum extraction ladder and quote. Meanwhile,
01:05:42.32 --> 01:05:47.68 Scarface Cobras were making gun runs, spads following suit hitting enemy sites.
01:05:48.32 --> 01:05:52.08 Quote everything seemed to slow down as the action heated up Grows said.
01:05:52.64 --> 01:05:56.56 Everything was in slow motion. When the ladder landed on the ground,
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:04.000 Paget told everyone to climb in, climb it and hook onto it. There was so much confusion and noise
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.60 that no one moved to the ladder. He said, finally I said follow me and up I went. They followed suit.
01:06:12.40 --> 01:06:20.000 This is just me, him. Grows said the lift off from the LZ wasn't easy. Quote, we had no idea
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000 just how bad the battle damage was but we were bouncing all over the sky and we had a huge beat.
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.40 Meaning that there was something terribly wrong with our main rotor blades and quote.
01:06:32.40 --> 01:06:37.36 Now the crew of YH20 was concerned about the safety of the aircraft and the men below
01:06:37.36 --> 01:06:43.60 riding on the extraction ladder. So you have the helicopter get shot down and then this other
01:06:43.60 --> 01:06:50.64 helicopter comes into rescue. They get lit up with a with a dish gun machine gun 12.7mm 51 cow,
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:57.84 which is a freaking massive machine gun. They get shot up with that. They throw the extraction ladder
01:06:57.84 --> 01:07:03.36 out the back. A bunch of the guys don't know what to do. Finally someone on the ground starts
01:07:03.36 --> 01:07:06.48 climbing the ladder. They all start climbing the ladder but they don't get up the ladder. So they're all
01:07:06.48 --> 01:07:13.84 just hanging onto this ladder and then this thing starts to try and get out of there and it's like a
01:07:13.84 --> 01:07:28.56 car with a piston that's not firing. Exactly. Quote, in hindsight there was really no way that
01:07:28.56 --> 01:07:36.32 we or anyone else could know how bad the damage was said grow. Quote, only when we finally made it
01:07:36.32 --> 01:07:42.16 back do we just learned how bad our damage was. Numerous rounds it cut the hydraulic lines to the
01:07:42.16 --> 01:07:49.60 tail rotor, one round from the 50-count it almost cut the main rotor tail drive shaft in half.
01:07:50.24 --> 01:07:56.08 That round it hit next to the Thomas coupling which connects the tail rotor drive shaft sections
01:07:56.08 --> 01:08:03.60 together. We were extremely lucky to have made it back to base. God was with us that day.
01:08:03.60 --> 01:08:10.96 Paget said. Man those helicopters are beasts to take that kind of damage. Oh yeah.
01:08:10.96 --> 01:08:21.52 Yeah. Salute. Salute the 53's. Amen. For the rest of the men on the ground during the night of
01:08:21.52 --> 01:08:28.72 day three there was no rest. By the way while all that's happened we still got 100 something
01:08:28.72 --> 01:08:34.72 guys left on the ground. The NVN testified it's attacks against the men of B company throwing an
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:41.04 estimated 600 plus hand grenades into the defense positions of the hatchet force even as it moved
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:45.60 a few times during the night. So now we're taking 600 hand grenades.
01:08:48.08 --> 01:08:53.44 By now the B company met it gained an important tactical advantage over the NVA. I like this. This is a
01:08:53.44 --> 01:08:58.48 good attitude to have right here. When we got a freaking down helicopter we got all these wounded
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:06.24 guys. We received 600 grenades and here you know what? Here we go. By now the B company men have gained
01:09:06.24 --> 01:09:12.48 an important tactical advantage over the NVA. They learned the NVA combat signals during the close
01:09:12.48 --> 01:09:19.60 in fighting. The NVA would hit two bamboo sticks together or use a whistle for signals. The hatchet
01:09:19.60 --> 01:09:28.32 force men learned that one click or one whistle signal the NVA to move. Two meant throw hand
01:09:28.32 --> 01:09:36.48 grenades and three meant withdraw. hatchet force men would then radio what signal what the signal was
01:09:36.48 --> 01:09:41.60 to the other team members so they could adjust accordingly. More than once when the NVA signal
01:09:41.60 --> 01:09:46.96 to withdraw the hatchet force men would then attack when they were more vulnerable. It was one more
01:09:46.96 --> 01:09:51.92 tactical advantage that they used to their advantage against an enemy force that continued to grow
01:09:51.92 --> 01:09:58.56 on the battlefield despite losing hundreds of men to air strikes, bombing runs and team ground fire.
01:09:59.76 --> 01:10:04.96 Meanwhile back in denying at their air base the Marines returned to repair their aircrafts
01:10:05.60 --> 01:10:13.92 as the warning order came down for day four. The weather and NVA hordes were closing in on B company.
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:24.000 Woof! With those hand grenades one of the things that the limb black discovered was that the
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.76 NVA had hand grenade vest where they would have four or five hand grenades in one vest that you
01:10:31.76 --> 01:10:39.28 get it and throw it forward and hold it and then all five grenades will launch at one time with the
01:10:39.28 --> 01:10:46.48 pins pulled so you have four or five hand grenades coming at you one time. They were all like
01:10:46.48 --> 01:10:54.000 tied together or something? Yeah. So when they got the vest and then threw it but held it the hand
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.08 grenades a task would then go forward. Oh god it. And so would this thing that was going on with the
01:11:00.08 --> 01:11:07.20 600 plus I'm sure that was one of the tactics the NVA were pulled because they had the hand grenade
01:11:07.20 --> 01:11:17.04 vest. That's a lot of grenades to respond. That's a lot of grenades to respond.
01:11:19.04 --> 01:11:22.88 That's a lot of grenades. You need to fully have go off because they're Chinese and Jai Kong.
01:11:22.88 --> 01:11:28.24 You still have only half go off. That's still 300 grenades. Yeah. And that also tells me something
01:11:28.24 --> 01:11:33.68 melts. It tells you how close the enemy was. Yeah. Because that means they're throwing those grenades.
01:11:33.68 --> 01:11:41.36 So this is close fighting. And not to mention you are not going to have close it's so close that
01:11:41.36 --> 01:11:47.20 we can hear their signaling when they're bang and tube bamboo sticks together. Primitive but effective.
01:11:47.20 --> 01:11:52.000 Primitive but effective but also so close that we can hear it and we hear it so much that we actually
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:59.68 decipher their freaking code. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Going back to the
01:11:59.68 --> 01:12:03.84 look the morning of Operation Tailwind day for Dawn to Palm Beach Company hatched force of Mac
01:12:03.84 --> 01:12:09.84 Vsog moving toward an LZ to lift out the more seriously wounded among the remaining 127 men
01:12:09.84 --> 01:12:16.64 who could still walk. All 16 green berets had been wounded at least once and about 40
01:12:16.64 --> 01:12:22.000 mont yard troops were wounded during the first three days of this secret for a deep in the
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:29.76 louse. So there you go. That's at least 40 probably more. Could nobody nobody count everybody's just too busy fighting.
01:12:32.40 --> 01:12:37.76 Be Company commanding Officer Captain G Maccarly had the point element moving toward an apparent
01:12:37.76 --> 01:12:45.60 clearing with one fought mind. Get one Marine Corps heavy lift. CH53 helicopter into pick up the wounded
01:12:45.60 --> 01:12:52.32 and then continue to march to destroy any NVA fortification supplies or troops they encountered.
01:12:53.04 --> 01:12:58.24 By now the entire second platoon was being used to help care for and transport the wounded
01:12:58.24 --> 01:13:05.20 under the tireless leadership of medic Gary Mike Rose including three wounded who were carried
01:13:05.20 --> 01:13:12.56 on impromptu stretchers. So there you go. You have an entire platoon of what 40 guys. Yeah. You have
01:13:12.56 --> 01:13:17.52 an entire platoon of 40 guys that are just being used to for the wounded help the wounded.
01:13:18.64 --> 01:13:24.56 So that's how hard it is to deal with wounded and move wounded. And his Marine has more
01:13:24.56 --> 01:13:33.76 feamed. Surreets are low. Fast forward a little bit. The men on the ground didn't know about
01:13:33.76 --> 01:13:40.000 two startling developments. The weather was closing in with a storm front that would prevent
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.88 attacker from supporting B company and operation tailwind had rocked the NVA brass into rallying
01:13:46.88 --> 01:13:55.20 hordes of north Vietnamese and path it loud troops that were moving toward the highway 165 area
01:13:55.20 --> 01:14:03.44 near the tiny hamlet of Chavane. So these guys don't know it but there's massive enemy coming
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:09.44 and bad weather. Now when this bad weather hits just to be clear if I didn't make this clear enough,
01:14:10.80 --> 01:14:15.68 the only thing that really keeps you guys alive on the ground at a certain point is just the
01:14:15.68 --> 01:14:21.68 fact that we have air superiority and you can drop bombs because they got hundreds if not thousands
01:14:21.68 --> 01:14:29.92 of troops going against you. So if you lose air support it's a matter of time because if
01:14:29.92 --> 01:14:35.12 look the NVA they don't care they'll keep coming they'll come in waves until they finally just
01:14:35.12 --> 01:14:42.88 overwhelm you with just a tritian. So if you lose tack air at some point you're going to be
01:14:42.88 --> 01:14:52.40 overrun and everyone's dead. Our edge is gone. Yeah. Yeah Dave. Here's McCarley quote when we
01:14:52.40 --> 01:14:56.16 started day four we hadn't thought about an extraction except for getting the wounded out.
01:14:56.16 --> 01:15:00.96 We took our mission seriously meaning he's saying look we're not even thinking about leaving yet.
01:15:00.96 --> 01:15:05.68 Not at all. We're staying out getting our wounded out but we're ready to go. We're going to stay.
01:15:06.80 --> 01:15:10.64 We took our mission seriously. Relieve the pressure on the CIA's operation.
01:15:11.28 --> 01:15:16.40 Thanks to tack air we had hurt the enemy no question and by continuously moving we had kept the
01:15:16.40 --> 01:15:22.24 NVA off balance. We were tired but our morale was good. We'd been on the move about an hour when we
01:15:22.24 --> 01:15:30.16 heard dogs. These weren't dogs that sounded like tracker dogs the NVA used on us. They sounded like pet dogs.
01:15:30.96 --> 01:15:36.64 So we moved toward their sound and the first platoon followed them. The dogs led B company to what
01:15:36.64 --> 01:15:42.24 would become one of the greatest military intelligence coup of the eight-year
01:15:42.24 --> 01:15:52.80 sog secret war in louss. They're not tracking dogs but they're just like pet dogs and the guys
01:15:52.80 --> 01:15:59.76 follow them back to this camp. That's me I'm going the other way. Dogs anywhere particularly in the
01:15:59.76 --> 01:16:06.56 A. Oh. Sorry. Yeah no the first time I think it was the first time you were on and we were
01:16:06.56 --> 01:16:09.84 talking about those tracking dogs about halfway through the conversation after you're talking
01:16:09.84 --> 01:16:14.88 about these dogs they're smelling you and they're closing on you and I was like tell do you still
01:16:15.44 --> 01:16:20.24 like do you not like dogs and you said I hate dogs. Yeah totally understood.
01:16:26.72 --> 01:16:32.08 Before long the enemy troops filed fire several B 40 rockets at the point element of B
01:16:32.08 --> 01:16:37.28 company and then fell back and look like they had gone back to some sort of bunker complex
01:16:37.28 --> 01:16:42.32 McCarley said after a brief skirmish and a brilliantly executed spad gun runs
01:16:43.04 --> 01:16:48.24 where they'd used cluster bomb units on enemy positions. The first platoon led the assault
01:16:48.24 --> 01:16:52.16 on those bunkers with a well coordinated attack while second platoon covered our flank
01:16:52.16 --> 01:16:59.04 and provided rear security. So so you guys these guys run up against an enemy position with bunkers
01:16:59.04 --> 01:17:05.76 and what do they do attack it? Yeah call in for closer support and attack it on day four. I mean
01:17:05.76 --> 01:17:08.96 these guys probably have eaten their short on water their wounded.
01:17:11.68 --> 01:17:16.64 Third platoon protected our right flank we caught them napping. We hit the outpost when they were
01:17:16.64 --> 01:17:22.40 cooking breakfast. There were open fires fires with cooking pots on them. Hell they never had
01:17:22.40 --> 01:17:30.16 anyone mess with them before this deep into louss. A few NVA hit in a couple the bunkers
01:17:30.16 --> 01:17:34.24 whom the montn yards quickly eliminated with hand grenades. Those bunkers were nothing but
01:17:34.24 --> 01:17:39.12 gory blood and guts after the grenade attacks McCarley said. Again a one-scirator,
01:17:39.12 --> 01:17:43.92 sky-raders delivered. CBU's precisely along two key enemy lines,
01:17:43.92 --> 01:17:48.48 instantly silencing enemy gunfire hand grenades and rocket attacks.
01:17:49.92 --> 01:17:56.08 Within a short period of time more than 70 NVA were killed as B company swept through the base.
01:17:56.08 --> 01:18:02.56 As B company drove the remaining NVA out of the outpost they discovered a bunker in the base of camp
01:18:02.56 --> 01:18:09.76 that quote appeared to be like a basement in a regular house. Said McCarley. It was at least 10 feet
01:18:09.76 --> 01:18:15.44 long and 10 feet wide with maps on the walls and a foot locker loaded with documents. I emptied my
01:18:15.44 --> 01:18:21.44 rock sack of everything except for extra car 15 ammo. By that time I'd use the extra battery,
01:18:21.44 --> 01:18:25.92 radio battery and C4 that I was carrying and I started packing with enemy documents papers,
01:18:25.92 --> 01:18:33.12 code books, transportation logs, and quote within 15 minutes the base camp was overrun. The
01:18:33.12 --> 01:18:38.08 area was searched for intelligence and photographs were taken as medic microes continued to
01:18:38.08 --> 01:18:46.40 treat the wounded men of the company. So this is a score. It's a coup and a half. Oh yeah, rich.
01:18:48.88 --> 01:18:53.28 By now it was clear to B company intelligence men that they had stumbled into an NVA
01:18:53.28 --> 01:18:57.92 battalion base camp that was a major logistical command center and probably the headquarters
01:18:57.92 --> 01:19:05.20 that controlled the nearby lay ocean highway 165. Remaining true to his original operation order,
01:19:05.20 --> 01:19:10.16 McCarley had all the intelligence documents packed and ordered B company and all of its walking
01:19:10.16 --> 01:19:15.52 wounded to march out of the battalion base camp while demolitions experts wired 120 millimeter
01:19:15.52 --> 01:19:21.52 mortar for enemy trucks and more than nine tons of rice for destruction. As usual after
01:19:21.52 --> 01:19:27.28 the special forces charges exploded A1 skyrators followed up with gunnapom and bombing runs
01:19:27.28 --> 01:19:36.88 to completely destroy all enemy structures and supplies. Boom. Nine tons of rice.
01:19:38.24 --> 01:19:45.84 Feet a lot of people. Oh yeah. Meanwhile back at con tomb fast forward a little bit.
01:19:45.84 --> 01:19:51.20 Meanwhile back at con tomb while all that's happening. All the air assets the A1 skyrators of
01:19:51.20 --> 01:20:00.64 the denang based operating location alpha alpha scar face pilots and CH53 pilots
01:20:00.64 --> 01:20:08.000 or getting a detailed briefing on the weather and a sighting by cubby of hundreds if not more
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.04 than a thousand NVA and path that loud troops moving east towards B company.
01:20:13.04 --> 01:20:20.80 Quote during that final briefing it was very clear today it was due or die.
01:20:21.92 --> 01:20:28.96 End quote from scar face pilot Joe Driscoll quote the big thing was the stark seriousness of the moment.
01:20:29.76 --> 01:20:34.80 Everyone knew they had suffered heavy casualties and now the weather was closing in on them.
01:20:35.60 --> 01:20:42.24 A1 skyrator pilot tom stomp added quote the weather was dog shit when we took off. I wasn't
01:20:42.24 --> 01:20:47.12 optimistic about getting them out of their end quote on the ground and louse McCarley pressed
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:52.64 forward until he received a disturbing radio call from Covey sometime in the early afternoon of
01:20:52.64 --> 01:21:00.80 September 14th day for of operation tailwind quote I believe it was Covey writer Jimmy Wardaddy Hart
01:21:01.92 --> 01:21:07.60 radio down and told us the NVA were massing and if that and that if we didn't get out of there today
01:21:07.60 --> 01:21:15.44 we weren't going to get out period that got my attention. Frankly he mentioned the weather issue
01:21:15.44 --> 01:21:20.96 too which up to that point in time I wasn't aware of because we were in the jungle end quote.
01:21:23.92 --> 01:21:29.44 Yeah that got your attention huh. Oh yeah and everybody back at base they know they're getting hammered
01:21:30.16 --> 01:21:36.48 and it was bad and they're getting ready to go they don't know how bad it is. It's like you're in a
01:21:36.48 --> 01:21:41.68 jungle like you've heard it before you don't know what the hell bad the weather is of your on the ground
01:21:41.68 --> 01:21:47.68 and you can't tell about times the difference between sun and the no sun that's just dark in the
01:21:47.68 --> 01:21:52.32 jungle and they break loose every once the while I get to open if they could see right
01:21:53.52 --> 01:21:58.08 Jean had no idea that's when Covey told because I interviewed Jean on and he was like
01:21:59.28 --> 01:22:05.20 stunned when they when the Covey told like he really thought we're going to kick Darius we just hit the
01:22:05.20 --> 01:22:11.76 cash you say cash or cash you're the English major I'm only English minor so I had a it's cash
01:22:11.76 --> 01:22:16.88 cash oh thank you sir it's cash I'll be more correct now I got corrected that I got corrected
01:22:16.88 --> 01:22:23.44 but on that when I was I think I was like an E five or something E four and you know I was
01:22:23.44 --> 01:22:28.56 briefing something and I said well there's a cash A over there my officers said actually
01:22:28.56 --> 01:22:35.28 charcoal it's cash and I said no it's not I didn't believe him you had to go to the dictionary
01:22:35.28 --> 01:22:40.88 and back then you actually had to get a dictionary yeah yeah well I'll tell you what you're the man
01:22:40.88 --> 01:22:47.12 if you want to call it cash A we can change it right now we we will follow suit I always preferred cash A
01:22:47.12 --> 01:22:52.40 me two things cool sound could be cash a status but cash A's got a little more
01:22:52.40 --> 01:23:01.20 more of a possess yeah so these guys are in a bad way and and now McCarley kind of
01:23:01.20 --> 01:23:07.12 realizes we got the enemy coming we got weather moving in back to the book realizing they
01:23:07.12 --> 01:23:15.20 needed a large LZ a large LZ large enough to handle a CH 53 because CH 53's are massive birds
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:22.000 in the light of and and by the way there's no opportunity you're not going to get 50 guys out on strings
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.24 so this thing's going to have to land yeah and you got wounded on top of that in light of losing
01:23:28.24 --> 01:23:33.52 one of the 53's heavy lift helicopters on a tight LZ the previous day yeah by the way we
01:23:33.52 --> 01:23:37.60 already lost one of these things McCarley moved down a road towards a clearing that was large enough
01:23:37.60 --> 01:23:43.76 for Nell Z however the open area was seated too deeply in a valley which had hills on two sides of
01:23:43.76 --> 01:23:48.72 it where the NVA gunners would be able to have clear fields of fire on the marine rescue helicopters
01:23:48.72 --> 01:23:55.68 as well as the supporting tack air assets Scarface cobre gunships to facilitate the continued
01:23:55.68 --> 01:24:02.64 movement of B company A1 spads and cobre Scarface Scarface cobre's quote gave us fire
01:24:02.64 --> 01:24:08.000 protection to the front and to the rear McCarley said the NVA kept hitting us with automatic fire
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.32 and B40s the air strikes kept them back far enough so they couldn't do any real damage
01:24:12.32 --> 01:24:20.16 at some point Kaviran dangerously low on fuel returned to base and connected spad pilot
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:26.96 Tom Stump directly with McCarley about future air strikes shortly before the first CH 53 arrived
01:24:26.96 --> 01:24:33.20 in the area of operations. I'll never forget it when I spoke to Gene that's McCarley when I spoke
01:24:33.20 --> 01:24:40.96 to Gene his voice was as calm as a man at Sunday church picnic Stump said he had that slow
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:48.72 southern draw and calmly said he was getting his ass kicked down there and all the while I could
01:24:48.72 --> 01:24:56.64 hear gun file gunfire explosions and hand grenades he said he needed some separation between the
01:24:56.64 --> 01:25:02.08 company and the NVA we were on station for two hours doing just that providing close air support
01:25:02.08 --> 01:25:12.72 with all the SF wounded in the large number of casualties they had I couldn't see how we'd get them out.
01:25:12.72 --> 01:25:21.20 Tom Stump McCarley and his men were grateful for the close air support of Stump his fellow
01:25:21.20 --> 01:25:27.36 spad pilot Scarface and tack air but Stump stood out in his mind McCarley said quote Tom Stump's
01:25:27.36 --> 01:25:32.80 flu so close to us during some of those gun runs I could tell if he had shaved or not.
01:25:33.44 --> 01:25:38.48 That's just how close those A1 sky Raiders flew in support of us. We were extremely grateful
01:25:38.48 --> 01:25:44.48 for all the air support believed me but seeing Stump was something that stuck with me. I also
01:25:44.48 --> 01:25:48.88 think that safe to say that because this was a song mission deep into louse none of the
01:25:48.88 --> 01:25:53.76 air assets got that credit they should have received for the remarkable coverage they provided
01:25:53.76 --> 01:25:59.44 to us over four days from the fast movers right down to Scarface and the Cubbies.
01:26:04.24 --> 01:26:10.000 Continuing on B company found a heavily traveled dirt road only wide enough for foot traffic
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.000 and headed to a second LZ one that provided better cover and less exposure to enemy ground fire
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.76 for the helicopters and for the men of B company as they moved cubby rider Jimmy Ward Daddy
01:26:21.76 --> 01:26:28.72 Hart told McCarley he had spotted another quote horde of NVA and quote moving toward B company.
01:26:29.76 --> 01:26:35.68 This time Hart told B company to put on their gas masks and directed A1 sorties
01:26:35.68 --> 01:26:42.80 flown by hobo 20 and fire 544 based in Thailand to deliver CBU 30 tear gas ordinance.
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:50.08 On the next horde of NVA while B company found it secured a second LZ for the Marine CH53 to land
01:26:50.08 --> 01:26:56.48 this drastic tactic worked it slowed down another NVA horde but many of the men and B company
01:26:56.48 --> 01:27:02.16 including McCarley rose and others were hit by the gas which had a lot of our guys crying and
01:27:02.16 --> 01:27:08.32 choking on that C.S. McCarley said but it also bought them some time so they called and some
01:27:10.72 --> 01:27:19.60 custom bomb units with some coughing gas in it. It's an irritant indeed right which is a
01:27:19.60 --> 01:27:23.52 lot different this is where this is where it's a little tricky and it comes up later but
01:27:24.80 --> 01:27:30.08 that is a chemical right people say well this is a chemical weapon and it is technically a
01:27:30.08 --> 01:27:35.60 chemical weapon but it's a freaking non lethal chemical weapon doesn't kill you. Right just your cry a lot
01:27:35.60 --> 01:27:46.80 if you can continue on the Scarface Cobras led the CH53 season to the LZ with deadly gunruns
01:27:46.80 --> 01:27:53.76 as an Air Force F4 Phantom Jets pounded two enemy mortar pits that were marching 82 millimeter
01:27:53.76 --> 01:27:59.12 rounds toward the LZ that was large enough for only one CH53 to land at a time.
01:27:59.12 --> 01:28:05.12 Quote we escorted the CH53s into LZ the first run wasn't as bad as the previous day
01:28:05.12 --> 01:28:11.04 when I could see dozens of enemy soldiers out in the open firing at us with and the choppers said
01:28:11.04 --> 01:28:17.12 Scarface pilot Joe Driscoll when Macarley lost radio contact with Covey Scarface commanding off
01:28:17.12 --> 01:28:23.68 Sir Lieutenant Colonel Harry Sexton and his co pilot Pat Owen quickly picked up coordinating
01:28:23.68 --> 01:28:30.40 the air assets with Macarley. The first heavy lift let helicopter landed on the LZ picking up
01:28:30.40 --> 01:28:35.28 a majority of the wounded B company men including the three most seriously wounded who were carried
01:28:35.28 --> 01:28:43.28 in stretchers since being wounded on night one of the operation. Since Platoon 2nd Platoon placed
01:28:43.28 --> 01:28:48.64 the wounded on the first Marine helicopter before it lifted off successfully and headed back to
01:28:48.64 --> 01:28:56.96 Conthune. Scarface again led the 2nd Marine Corps CH53 into the LZ this time taking an increased
01:28:56.96 --> 01:29:03.52 volume of enemy gunfire as aviators pointed out to Macarley another large contingent of NVA
01:29:03.52 --> 01:29:09.84 moving toward the LZ now what appeared that the NVA brass realized that B company had hit the
01:29:09.84 --> 01:29:16.88 559th transportation base camp and taken all of its maps, reports records and money and had
01:29:16.88 --> 01:29:26.80 directed masses of enemy troops towards B company. They told me they could see hundreds of
01:29:26.80 --> 01:29:35.12 them's coming of for us. The 2nd Marine Corps CH53 picked up the remaining wounded men and several
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:40.96 other members of B company and lifted off the LZ successfully drawing more enemy fire than the first
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:47.60 heavy lift helicopter. Scarface then led the 3rd CH53 so we got two helicopters of command we've
01:29:47.60 --> 01:29:53.52 gotten most the wounded on the first one the bunch of guys leave on the 2nd one that's all successful
01:29:53.52 --> 01:29:59.84 and now we go Scarface led the 3rd CH53 into the LZ taking even more enemy fire than the
01:29:59.84 --> 01:30:06.000 2 previous choppers had encountered. However from Macarley rose first sergeant Morris Adair
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:13.92 and the remaining men of B company the drama wasn't over. CH53 ceased down in pilot
01:30:13.92 --> 01:30:23.20 Don first lieutenant Don Persegi and his coal pilot first lieutenant Bill Baddie or Bady. We're
01:30:23.20 --> 01:30:28.48 concerned about the amount of rounds hitting the heavy lift chopper. I like the way they explained that.
01:30:28.48 --> 01:30:31.68 Yeah, I'm a little concerned. I'm concerned about this.
01:30:32.40 --> 01:30:37.60 The quote on our final approach we took heavy enemy fire Persegi said we knew that this was the
01:30:37.60 --> 01:30:45.12 last element on the ground that we had to get them out. Sergeant first sergeant or SF sergeant Mike
01:30:45.12 --> 01:30:50.80 Hagen said quote I can tell you that big bird was a welcome sight to us. We were all beat.
01:30:50.80 --> 01:30:56.56 We were all wounded and we were all ready to go home. Believe me and quote be company commander
01:30:57.36 --> 01:31:04.24 Captain Jean Macarley Hagen, Medic Sergeant Rose and first sergeant Morris Adair held a
01:31:04.24 --> 01:31:10.48 tight defensive perimeter with a few mont yards as others beat a hasty but orderly path into the
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:16.88 large marine war bird as dozens of NVA soldiers surged out of the CS gas clouds towards the LZ.
01:31:16.88 --> 01:31:22.56 Macarley was on the radio with Covey. He said you have to get out of there now. This is so this is
01:31:22.56 --> 01:31:28.80 a Macarley saying that Covey said you have to get out of there now. There's hundreds and
01:31:28.80 --> 01:31:38.40 hundreds of them coming after you now. Now that's what Macarley is getting told you have to
01:31:38.40 --> 01:31:42.72 get out of there now. And I don't know how many are left on the ground but it's probably
01:31:42.72 --> 01:31:48.88 what 15 or 20 or something like that. Yeah, because they had the worst wounded. Yeah.
01:31:48.88 --> 01:31:55.76 In the second bird they got a lot of you did you out. As Macarley spoke into the PRC 25
01:31:55.76 --> 01:32:00.48 handset, a mont near a team member standing between Macarley and the radio operator was killed
01:32:00.48 --> 01:32:07.36 by enemy gunfire as he fired his weapon at them. He got shot in the heads. Macarley said there was
01:32:07.36 --> 01:32:12.88 blood all over the place. Another yard looked at him turned to me with a sad look and simply said
01:32:13.76 --> 01:32:23.36 he's dead. A1 Skyrader pilot Tom Stump vividly remembers those long moments before the man of
01:32:23.36 --> 01:32:32.48 B company boarded CH53. It was a wild scene down there as we provided close cover to the team on
01:32:32.48 --> 01:32:39.68 the ground. Air Force F4 is attacked anti aircraft guns that the NVA had moved into the area.
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:49.20 They, meaning the NVA, had really, had really wanted them. They were mass to get them. They wanted
01:32:49.20 --> 01:32:56.88 to get back what the team had taken from the base camp. Kavie riders told us that NVA, 12.7
01:32:56.88 --> 01:33:03.92 millimeter and 37 millimeter anti aircraft weapons were opening up on us. Meanwhile, the Scarface
01:33:03.92 --> 01:33:09.12 Cobra gunships reacted to enemy gunfire on their aircraft while Jean directed us to enemy
01:33:09.12 --> 01:33:15.52 troops moving toward them. Keep in mind, we knew all the SF men were wounded and low on ammo.
01:33:15.52 --> 01:33:21.84 There was a moment in time when I couldn't see how we'd get them out. It was that intense.
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:33.28 Coming out of the gas, she used. Not everyone was low on ammo.
01:33:34.32 --> 01:33:39.76 As he was severely wounded in the foot, hand an arm on day one, rose at tightly wrapped
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:45.52 their torn jungle boot and bleeding foot with an ace bandage to keep it shut and it used his
01:33:45.52 --> 01:33:50.80 car 15 more as a cane to support his weight than as a weapon because he was so busy treating and
01:33:50.80 --> 01:33:56.16 tending to more than 60 wounded men. His left hand had suffered a shrapnel wound also,
01:33:56.48 --> 01:34:01.28 which he quickly wrapped before returning to caring for the wounded team. Now, as he
01:34:01.28 --> 01:34:09.92 a dare and haggard and a hat, haggard moved up the ramp. The semi-mobile medic opened fire on the
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:15.44 rapidly approaching NVA after they placed their dead-mont Neward soldier on the helicopter.
01:34:17.20 --> 01:34:23.36 McCarley was the last man to leave the LZ. Quote, as we were backing up the ramp,
01:34:23.36 --> 01:34:28.96 they were coming toward us. They were coming at us hard. He said, I'm guessing the CS gas had
01:34:28.96 --> 01:34:36.24 them confused because they were getting close to us as me, Mike, and Morris stood, but none of
01:34:36.24 --> 01:34:42.16 them through a grenade into the chopper. I never understood why they didn't. They were that close
01:34:42.16 --> 01:34:49.12 and they kept coming even as we lifted off from the LZ while mowing down NVA soldiers.
01:34:49.12 --> 01:34:57.28 So, they go through all that and it looks like we're going to be in a pretty good spot,
01:34:57.28 --> 01:35:07.68 possibly. But it ain't over till it's over. Indeed. As the CH53 lifted off from the LZ,
01:35:07.68 --> 01:35:12.88 pilot Persegi said, he and co-pilot, batty. What do you think that's batty or batty?
01:35:12.88 --> 01:35:20.88 Batty. Batty. Could feel enemy rounds continuing to hit the aircraft. A dare, McCarley and Rose had just
01:35:20.88 --> 01:35:25.84 sat down next to Sergeant First Class, Bernie Bright, when someone tapped Rose on the shoulder
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:30.40 and pointed to the left door, gunner, Marine Sergeant Stevens, who was bleeding profusely from
01:35:30.40 --> 01:35:37.92 a gunshot wound at the neck. Rose said, quote, he got hit in the neck. There was blood everywhere.
01:35:37.92 --> 01:35:42.16 I was coated in blood by then from him and other wounded. He was very lucky. The round
01:35:42.16 --> 01:35:48.48 administered the corroded artery and trachea yet he was going into shock. I rolled him over,
01:35:49.36 --> 01:35:54.16 got him on all fours and remember telling him, listen, you lucky son of a bitch. If you're going
01:35:54.16 --> 01:35:59.76 to die, you'd be dead by now. After that, he started to bounce back. Sometimes as a medic,
01:36:00.56 --> 01:36:04.88 you have sometimes as a medic. You have to be harsh with people to break them out of shock.
01:36:04.88 --> 01:36:07.84 Then I found something to wrap around his neck to get the bleeding to stop.
01:36:07.84 --> 01:36:14.32 As Rose struggled with Stevens bleeding neck injury, knee to realize that the Marine
01:36:14.32 --> 01:36:20.96 door gunner's helmet, helmets open microphone was alive. Explain this a little bit when you're
01:36:20.96 --> 01:36:26.64 on an aircraft. The people in the aircraft have what they call interior communications,
01:36:26.64 --> 01:36:31.36 which is basically a, you know, if you're the pilot, you can talk to the copilot and then
01:36:31.36 --> 01:36:35.92 you can both talk to the aircraft. Everyone's got these little helmets on with microphones.
01:36:35.92 --> 01:36:39.52 And it crews in the back and they can't see each other. So they have to have verbal contact.
01:36:39.52 --> 01:36:43.92 And if you, I know it looks like in a movie, everyone's talking in an aircraft, in a helicopter.
01:36:43.92 --> 01:36:49.36 You can't hear anything in a helicopter. You have to scream directly into someone's ear to hear someone
01:36:49.36 --> 01:36:53.04 especially in a CH53. Those things are freaking loud.
01:36:53.84 --> 01:36:58.72 And so the air crew has these headsets with these microphones that are built a special way so that
01:36:58.72 --> 01:37:04.80 they don't pick up the external numbers. They just pick up the voice. Well, when you key that handset,
01:37:06.08 --> 01:37:12.24 your transmitting, your, your filling up that interior communications network with whatever noise
01:37:12.24 --> 01:37:17.84 you're putting into it. And so I'll go back to the book here. Communications were almost impossible
01:37:18.24 --> 01:37:22.72 as he was on a hot mic. A hot mic is when you're keying up your microphone when you shouldn't be.
01:37:22.72 --> 01:37:28.96 And all I could hear was gasping and gurgling said, Purski was having a potentially deadly loss of
01:37:28.96 --> 01:37:36.000 power issue with the severely damaged CH53 C-Stalian. As the heavily laden helicopter lifted off
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.72 from the LZ and went from a hover mode into transitional lift where the helicopter begins to
01:37:40.72 --> 01:37:46.72 gain both altitude and speed. Engine failure emergency lights and warning systems screamed alerts of
01:37:46.72 --> 01:37:54.96 a pending engine failure within seconds one engine died. Purski had only one remaining engine to continue
01:37:54.96 --> 01:38:01.12 lifting away from the hordes of NVA gathering or on and around the LZ shooting at the C-Stalian.
01:38:01.12 --> 01:38:06.72 And at least one entire craft weapon that was firing at the struggling Sikorski. In addition,
01:38:07.36 --> 01:38:13.44 he and Badi had another challenge on their horizon. How do avoid the mountains that they were approaching
01:38:13.44 --> 01:38:21.12 with only one engine? That ridge line was sheer granite Purski said. By now, in the back of the
01:38:21.12 --> 01:38:25.84 chopper, rose it pulled off Steven's helmet, giving Purski and Badi improved communications
01:38:25.84 --> 01:38:31.20 between them and other air assets as the granite mountain loomed larger by the second quote,
01:38:31.20 --> 01:38:37.44 we were worried as we had to use extra energy from the last engine to get over that ridge line.
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:43.92 Purski said, after narrowly getting over it, a second granite lid ridge line came in to view.
01:38:43.92 --> 01:38:50.08 It, it too, had to be flown over. Now the big war board war bird was struggling.
01:38:51.36 --> 01:38:56.32 quote, there were hydraulic fluids and blood everywhere inside the helicopter rose said.
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:03.12 And the tail was lower than it should be. We could tell something was wrong. Really wrong.
01:39:03.12 --> 01:39:18.000 We just didn't know how wrong. Can you imagine? No. No. No. It's it's total mayhem and then you
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:24.64 have these pilots that are getting shot at their aircrafts filled up with a bunch of wounded
01:39:24.64 --> 01:39:30.000 guys. They're taking rounds. They can feel the rounds hitting and they still have to fly this thing.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.32 And now they've got to fly it under conditions that they've never flown under before, which is
01:39:34.32 --> 01:39:39.92 having one engine and damaged controls and not being able to communicate with each other.
01:39:39.92 --> 01:39:49.60 This is just mayhem. Back to the book, seconds after barely getting over the second ridge line,
01:39:49.60 --> 01:39:59.04 the second CH53D turbo shaft engine failed. At that moment, quote, I can remember,
01:39:59.04 --> 01:40:03.92 first lieutenant Pertsky's exact words to this day said Maccarlie. He said,
01:40:03.92 --> 01:40:11.76 mayday, mayday, we've lost all hydraulics. We're going down. I looked out of the back and all
01:40:11.76 --> 01:40:17.76 I saw were the granite cliffs. They loomed large to this day. I don't know how we missed them.
01:40:18.80 --> 01:40:22.40 And quote, rose echoed the same sentiment.
01:40:22.40 --> 01:40:32.000 quote, all I saw were those huge granite cliffs with no engines. I fully expected to crash and
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:39.52 burn at any moment. And quote, Pertsky haulered into the radio one more time. We've lost our second
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:48.000 engine. We're going down. The fate of the 23,628 pound 88 foot long helicopter designed to carry
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.52 38 combat troops, but now loaded with 40 plus combat troops and weapons, including all the intelligence
01:40:53.52 --> 01:41:00.48 papers, maps, foot lockers and North Vietnamese currencies from the NVA's base camp hinged on Pertsky's
01:41:00.48 --> 01:41:07.20 piloting skills and the six 72 foot long rotors that were keeping the 15 foot wide helicopter
01:41:07.20 --> 01:41:13.20 loft biting into the air, descending at a rapid rate, but at a rate better than dropping from the
01:41:13.20 --> 01:41:21.28 sky like a dead coil. After he got out a second Mayday alert, Pertsky said he was hoping a pilot
01:41:21.28 --> 01:41:28.48 or cavi pilot would say something. After a second engine went out, there was nowhere to go. All we
01:41:28.48 --> 01:41:35.28 could see was jungle and granite ridge lines. Quote, I really expected someone, cavi, scar face,
01:41:35.28 --> 01:41:41.28 the spads or army cobras to say, hey, go left, go right something, but the radio was dead silent.
01:41:41.28 --> 01:41:53.84 For Pertsky and Badi, the silence was deafening. Now descending in full auto rotation with both
01:41:53.84 --> 01:42:00.48 engines dead, Pertsky began following jungle covered canyons. I followed one gap, he said,
01:42:00.48 --> 01:42:05.60 then I followed a second gap, it led to a ravine. My biggest concern at that moment was being
01:42:05.60 --> 01:42:13.36 able to find a place just to auto rotate into. Marine Corps Dorgon Erlary Grow, who was in the first
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:20.88 CH53 that pulled out many of the wounded men from B company earlier, said, quote, at that time,
01:42:20.88 --> 01:42:31.20 no one had ever done a full auto rotation with a fully loaded CH53 with no power. Swanson watched
01:42:31.20 --> 01:42:38.16 the large warbird descend into a canyon. Quote, it was like a depression he headed towards.
01:42:38.72 --> 01:42:44.88 It was trailing smoke. It was ugly, real ugly. I worried that it might explode in midair, or worst
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:50.08 get hit by one of our wars hit one of those granite mountains or the jungle. From my seat up in the
01:42:50.08 --> 01:42:57.84 old trusty skyrator, I couldn't see any L.C. or any area that was open or large enough for those
01:42:57.84 --> 01:43:04.96 Marines to land that bird without crashing. By now I had heard that they were auto rotating with a
01:43:04.96 --> 01:43:18.32 chopper full of troops. It didn't look good. So auto rotating. Yeah. So basically, when a helicopter,
01:43:18.32 --> 01:43:23.84 if a helicopter loses power, you know, if an airplane loses power, you can glide.
01:43:23.84 --> 01:43:30.32 Somewhat, you're not going to gain altitude. I mean, I guess you could technically, if you get an
01:43:30.32 --> 01:43:35.60 updraft or current or whatever, but you're generally going to come down. When a helicopter loses
01:43:35.60 --> 01:43:43.12 all of its power, what the pilot has to do is let the blades, the rotor blades of the helicopter
01:43:43.12 --> 01:43:49.52 keep spinning as fast as they can while you're falling. And then basically, when you get close
01:43:49.52 --> 01:43:56.24 to the ground, you slam those things into the position. It tells those roders to they grab as much
01:43:56.24 --> 01:44:00.88 air as possible in the moment before you hit the ground and you hope that it absorbs enough
01:44:00.88 --> 01:44:04.48 energy that you don't all die. Echo, you look puzzled. Does that make sense?
01:44:05.68 --> 01:44:10.32 Not really. I think there's a lot about it helicopter. I don't know about it.
01:44:10.32 --> 01:44:15.84 Yeah. Because it seems like a helicopter loses power, the propellers just stop.
01:44:15.84 --> 01:44:20.96 But there's momentum. So just pick your sprinting. Just like a spinning stop.
01:44:20.96 --> 01:44:25.52 Keeps the blades going. All right. Like a, are you descending in the air, hit them,
01:44:25.52 --> 01:44:30.96 and keep some of the head or angles that make them spin? I'm not like a rate with the engine.
01:44:30.96 --> 01:44:34.64 So it slows down, but it's better than like he said, just fall down the sky.
01:44:34.64 --> 01:44:38.08 Right. Like those, you know, remember those windmills he's to buy when you're kid and you
01:44:38.08 --> 01:44:43.44 you see them saying, the wind. Okay. If you went into a runway, no wind and you just spun that
01:44:43.44 --> 01:44:49.12 thing. Yeah. It would spin a little bit. But yeah, as you move it, it can spin. Yes. So that's
01:44:49.12 --> 01:44:55.04 God. That's the most thing spinning. And then you laid it along. Yeah. And you know that the blades
01:44:55.04 --> 01:45:01.04 can tilt. You control the tilt of the blades. You can make them kind of flat or you can make them
01:45:01.60 --> 01:45:05.60 like at a bigger angle. So they're grabbing more air. So what you do is you kind of make them flat.
01:45:05.60 --> 01:45:09.44 So they're not getting much resistance, but they're spinning. I, and this is just like I'm,
01:45:09.44 --> 01:45:14.40 I know, I know, I know. I know, I know, I know. I know the juggle. This is how I simplify stuff.
01:45:14.40 --> 01:45:20.64 And with the rocks up in my head. And then when you get close to the ground, you slam that thing.
01:45:20.64 --> 01:45:25.44 So it grabs a bunch of air right before you hit and it slows you down a little bit.
01:45:25.44 --> 01:45:33.76 God. That's the plan. Yes. And in history, no one had ever done this before with a scene with
01:45:33.76 --> 01:45:39.84 the CH53. Okay, filled with troops because as you can imagine, you're adding thousands of
01:45:39.84 --> 01:45:45.36 pounds to it with all these troops in there. So no one's ever done this before. So we'll just say that
01:45:46.08 --> 01:45:50.48 the odds were stacked against this point. It ain't looking good. Okay. God.
01:45:53.44 --> 01:46:00.32 Continuing on, and then divine intervention, Persky and Badi saw a body of water
01:46:00.32 --> 01:46:07.20 with a little patch of beach. It was just blind luck. We didn't know what was there. Or we didn't
01:46:07.20 --> 01:46:13.04 know what was there. Or God was with us. Persky said with the blood hydraulic fluid and aviation
01:46:13.04 --> 01:46:18.24 fuel leaking and pooling in the passenger compartment, Persky headed in that direction. At first,
01:46:18.24 --> 01:46:22.64 he thought about landing in the water to buffer some of the impact of the landing. Then I remembered
01:46:22.64 --> 01:46:27.28 Persky said, we had wounded in the back. I didn't want to take the chance of anyone drowning.
01:46:27.28 --> 01:46:32.96 So we headed the wounded chopper toward what appeared to be a sandy beach next to the water,
01:46:32.96 --> 01:46:38.000 even though it was slanted to the right. All this happened in a matter of seconds. We were going
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:46.24 down at about 6,000 feet a minute. At that point, we needed a high air speed to use the energy to
01:46:46.24 --> 01:46:51.68 keep the roaders going. So the auto rotation factor would keep the aircraft moving forward and
01:46:51.68 --> 01:46:56.96 said a dropping from the sky. The plan was to flare a procedure where the roaders angle, pitch
01:46:56.96 --> 01:47:04.16 change to slow down the rated descent and minimize the severity of impact upon landing on Terra
01:47:04.16 --> 01:47:11.28 firma. So I was right. The rocks worked. The rocks worked. Dave Berks got nothing on me.
01:47:15.28 --> 01:47:19.76 I started to flare. Thank you. We had enough time to decrease our speed. More. I pulled the
01:47:19.76 --> 01:47:25.44 collective hard. I had it pulled up to my armpit and quote, in a helicopter, the collective lever
01:47:25.44 --> 01:47:29.44 is on the left side of the pilot's seat. And it changed the pitch angle on the helicopter's
01:47:29.44 --> 01:47:34.80 main roaders. In this case, Persky was decreasing the sea stallion speed, hoping to minimize the
01:47:34.80 --> 01:47:41.52 final impact of landing in full-order rotation. Persky added, it didn't slow our air speed as
01:47:41.52 --> 01:47:46.96 much as I had hoped it would. It was supposed to cushion us. It didn't. What's more that beach
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:56.88 had a huge boulder on it that slanted to the right. The helicopter violently landed on the angled
01:47:56.88 --> 01:48:01.68 slope, hitting the slope surface and instantly slamming to the right into the ground, ejecting
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:08.08 several of the green berets and their montn yard tribesmen, team members, while six rotors
01:48:08.08 --> 01:48:14.80 shattered upon impact with the ground. Be Company Commanding Officer Captain Jean McCarley
01:48:14.80 --> 01:48:19.20 was violently slammed into the roof of the helicopter before being ejected from it. I remember
01:48:19.20 --> 01:48:24.08 hitting the roof of the helicopter. I remember hitting so hard. I felt my teeth crumbling to sand.
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.44 The next thing I knew I was outside on a rock. We were all dazed, amazed we were still alive.
01:48:34.40 --> 01:48:40.16 Rose said quote, when you pan-cake in like we did on a helicopter and when it hits violently
01:48:40.16 --> 01:48:44.80 upside down, everybody had their bell rung. Trust me we were all hurting. Jean was bleeding from
01:48:44.80 --> 01:48:50.08 the mouth, but he could move. I remember getting thrown out of the blit, throwing out and the blades
01:48:50.08 --> 01:48:56.24 were upside down. I was bleary-eyed, still not getting all my senses back and for a moment I
01:48:56.24 --> 01:49:02.16 thought the chopper was coming toward me. And quote, McCarley said quote,
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:08.80 Mike was standing beside us. I was wiping the blood and my crush teeth from my mouth. Then
01:49:08.80 --> 01:49:15.12 Mike said, we've got people in there. We have to get them out. I could smell the aviation fuel.
01:49:15.12 --> 01:49:20.72 There was blood everywhere. There was hydraulic fluids. The helicopter was broken by the severity
01:49:20.72 --> 01:49:25.76 of the crash and it was smoking. How it didn't explode. I'll never know how that young Marine
01:49:25.76 --> 01:49:30.64 pilot landed. I'll be at a hard landing. I'll never know." End quote.
01:49:30.64 --> 01:49:39.04 Then McCarley had one of those unique inexplicable moments in wartime. In the middle of
01:49:39.04 --> 01:49:44.32 all the rubble, the smoke, the dazed confusion at the crash site. He looked to his right and
01:49:44.32 --> 01:49:51.04 observed first sergeant Morris Adair standing in the water with a smile on his face holding his
01:49:51.04 --> 01:50:02.000 car 15. That scene was unreal beyond description McCarley said of all the times that I've been
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.32 in loudside never seen a scene like this. A body of water, a nice white sandy beach. It looked
01:50:06.32 --> 01:50:11.84 just like a white. And there's Adair standing in the water as though there wasn't a care in the world.
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:19.36 Adair says to this day, I can't explain exactly what happened that day. I came out on my own
01:50:19.36 --> 01:50:23.60 but I've been trying to figure out how ever since. When I came to my senses I was standing in
01:50:23.60 --> 01:50:27.92 water. Gene told me later I was standing there smiling. Can't tell you why I was smiling. Maybe
01:50:27.92 --> 01:50:32.16 I was just happy to still be alive after getting my bell wrong. We were bad at around like
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:36.80 BBC that chopper went at crash. At the time, I didn't realize how much damage it had been
01:50:36.80 --> 01:50:42.40 done to my nerves on my less side of my body, my head, neck, shoulder, arms, and hip.
01:50:42.40 --> 01:50:53.52 The brief reverie ended when Rose and McCarley headed back into the smoking helicopter.
01:50:54.48 --> 01:50:58.80 Because it ain't over yet because they got guys in there. And it's
01:50:58.80 --> 01:51:06.16 f***gap. Fewer leaking everywhere. Burning. But what do they do? They go help. Rose helped to carry out
01:51:06.16 --> 01:51:15.04 SF Lieutenant Pete Landon who had only been in country one week when Operation Tailwind launched.
01:51:15.92 --> 01:51:24.000 Welcome to Sog. McCarley said, Landon, the bulltoon leader had a bad gash on his head that Rose
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.08 had to tend to as there was a lot of blood flowing from the headwoon. McCarley gathered the
01:51:28.08 --> 01:51:33.36 intelligence materials, B company had collected. That was the first thing I did.
01:51:33.36 --> 01:51:38.24 Recovery to the intel documents maps currency that we had seized from the NVA base camp. No way
01:51:38.24 --> 01:51:45.12 we were going back to cartoon without them. After setting up a hasty perimeter at the rear of
01:51:45.12 --> 01:51:51.60 the broken Sikorski helicopter, McCarley returned to help. Sergeant first class Bernie Bright
01:51:51.60 --> 01:51:57.52 get untangled from the wires and debris inside the aircraft. Then they exited the helicopter
01:51:57.52 --> 01:52:01.92 to strengthen the perimeter around the back side of it. In the pilot's compartment,
01:52:01.92 --> 01:52:07.68 Perseke unstrapped Batty who had pulled a bad back compression stemming from the crash.
01:52:07.68 --> 01:52:12.48 I kind of pulled Bill from the helicopter. He was mobile but still stunned. When Perseke
01:52:12.48 --> 01:52:17.44 had set Batty down on the ground in front of the helicopter, he didn't see any SF man on that
01:52:17.44 --> 01:52:24.64 side of the bird. My infantry tactics kicked in. We circled the wagon, set up a rough perimeter.
01:52:24.64 --> 01:52:32.000 He said Perseke said, In the back of the helicopter, Rose McCarley and Mike Hagen
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.48 helped the stun troops exit the helicopter. Before I led any of the injured get off the helicopter,
01:52:38.48 --> 01:52:43.04 I drape their weapons or any weapon near them around their neck so that when they set up
01:52:43.04 --> 01:52:47.92 in the perimeter, they'd be able to defend themselves, said Rose. By this point in time,
01:52:47.92 --> 01:52:55.36 we were strictly working on adrenaline. He added. So even those guys, he's got to
01:52:55.36 --> 01:53:00.32 bend them through all this freaking mayhem and they still go back and rescue their guys and then
01:53:00.32 --> 01:53:07.84 they're still thinking tactically about how to get through this. Yeah Mike Rose is on top of his
01:53:07.84 --> 01:53:16.80 game for a whole thing. Just amazing. Continuing on once again, time was working against the
01:53:16.80 --> 01:53:22.88 men on the ground. I forget how long it took from the time we crashed until I received radio
01:53:22.88 --> 01:53:28.64 contact from either Lieutenant Colonel Sexton or Kovey said McCarley. They told him that the
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:34.16 backup helicopters fuel levels were getting low and that when he came into the LZ, we'd only
01:53:34.16 --> 01:53:40.16 have five minutes or less to get the hell out. Oh, we might not have enough aviation fuel to make it back.
01:53:40.16 --> 01:53:50.48 After dodging Russian assisted NVA attack aircraft weapons, including Russian manufactured
01:53:50.48 --> 01:53:54.80 attack weapons that exploded in midair and the fashion of anti aircraft weapons in World War
01:53:54.80 --> 01:54:00.80 2 and hundreds of enemy ground forces firing automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades at
01:54:00.80 --> 01:54:06.08 them pilots in the first car face, cobras that led the rescue helicopter toward the LZ were
01:54:06.08 --> 01:54:13.44 surprised to receive no enemy ground fire. The heavy lift, marine sea stallion followed closely
01:54:13.44 --> 01:54:19.36 behind the Scarface gunships due to the heavy enemy ground fire throughout operation tailwind
01:54:19.36 --> 01:54:26.64 to provide extra defensive fire power for the big helicopter captain H. Kipola.
01:54:26.64 --> 01:54:34.32 Yeah. Kipola. Captain H. Kipola was on the rear ramp with an M60 machine gun in addition to
01:54:34.32 --> 01:54:41.60 right door gunner, sergeant T. McBride on the left door gunner, sergeant T. Winnicky
01:54:42.48 --> 01:54:50.72 and crew chief sergeant Smith. Even though we had our bell wrong, when that chase ship
01:54:51.44 --> 01:54:57.76 backup helicopter landed, we didn't waste any time getting aboard it said Mike Rose. I remember
01:54:57.76 --> 01:55:03.04 H. G. G. and G. and first sergeant helping me helping people up the ramp. Marine pilot
01:55:03.04 --> 01:55:07.68 Perseke knew that he had bitten through his lip upon the crash impact, but he didn't realize
01:55:07.68 --> 01:55:13.12 how severely damaged it was until he moved up the ramp of the CH53 and one of the door gunners
01:55:13.12 --> 01:55:17.76 pointed out that his lower lip was merely hanging on by a thin piece of skin.
01:55:19.44 --> 01:55:23.76 Quote, he told me that I better hold onto my lip or I'd lose it. I do remember they changed
01:55:23.76 --> 01:55:31.76 my call sign afterwards to lip. As the sea stallion lifted off with the wounded and extremely
01:55:31.76 --> 01:55:38.16 fatigued man of V company Rose made another surprising discovery, maggots had helped to treat
01:55:38.16 --> 01:55:44.32 the two most seriously wounded team members who had been carried since day since the command post
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:51.12 would struck by an RPG round during day one. When that RPG hit, Rose had suffered serious wounds
01:55:51.12 --> 01:55:56.48 in two places, McCarley in several places, and two engaged team members had been seriously
01:55:56.48 --> 01:56:02.96 incapacitated. The one thing I never thought about or planned for said Rose was for the use of
01:56:02.96 --> 01:56:09.92 maggots, which in the end proved to be the most likely life saver for the two most critically wounded
01:56:09.92 --> 01:56:15.68 team members. During those four days on the ground, Rose and the Montyarde medic trainee
01:56:15.68 --> 01:56:21.52 caught were kept busy caring for them, giving them extra fluid, more fun shots and IVs, but
01:56:21.52 --> 01:56:27.68 during those days, quote, flies laid their eggs in the wounds of the most seriously injured and a
01:56:27.68 --> 01:56:36.08 few other yards and the eggs hatched. According to the doctors at the evacuation hospital,
01:56:36.08 --> 01:56:43.04 the maggots got to the necrotic flesh before infection could set in and in fact did a better
01:56:43.04 --> 01:56:46.96 job of deep writing the wounds that a surgeon could do, who would have thought of it.
01:56:46.96 --> 01:56:58.24 We covered a book where that happened with the prisoner war camps in in the World War II.
01:56:58.24 --> 01:57:06.40 The medics would actually utilize maggots. They would get them to plant. They're maggots
01:57:06.40 --> 01:57:17.52 there, get the flies to plant their seeds there. So to eat away the dying skin. Crazy. Oh yeah.
01:57:18.88 --> 01:57:24.40 The CH53 returned to Dactu to refuel while the A1 pilot swans and then stomp to
01:57:24.40 --> 01:57:30.32 strode the crashed CH53. The rescue sea stallion then returned to be company to the LZ
01:57:30.32 --> 01:57:37.60 outside the top secret Saga compound in contomb. An S2 officer approached McCarley and took his
01:57:37.60 --> 01:57:42.96 Ruxack which contained the enemy currency and some of the intelligence documents collected from
01:57:42.96 --> 01:57:49.12 the NVA command post and louss. I never saw that Ruxack can nor the NVA currency again McCarley
01:57:49.12 --> 01:57:56.32 lamented. He continued regardless. The mission was dubbed a success by the folks in Saga on
01:57:56.32 --> 01:58:01.52 and at Saga headquarters. We were told that thanks to R efforts, the CIA's operation was able to
01:58:01.52 --> 01:58:08.32 regain control of the strong point. A top plateau 10 days after we were extracted on the final helicopter.
01:58:08.32 --> 01:58:15.12 We had tied down an estimated regiment of NVA and path that louss forces while destroying one major
01:58:15.12 --> 01:58:21.52 enemy ammo dump and an enemy base camp after we removed the enemy documents and maps. A subsequent
01:58:21.52 --> 01:58:28.64 DOD report confirmed McCarley's final analysis that Operation Tailwind was saws deepest penetration
01:58:28.64 --> 01:58:36.48 into louss during the eight-year secret war. The final count, three-month yards were killed in action.
01:58:37.60 --> 01:58:44.40 33 were listed as wounded in action. A total of 33 purple hearts were awarded to the 16 green
01:58:44.40 --> 01:58:49.76 berets who served in Operation Tailwind for wounds they were served during the four
01:58:49.76 --> 01:58:58.16 day mission. McCarley required nine months of dental repair and surgery due to crashing crushing
01:58:58.16 --> 01:59:07.04 his teeth when the CH-53 crashed. Two days after the green berets returned to CCC completed their
01:59:07.04 --> 01:59:12.000 reports and got patched up by special forces medics on base. A huge party was held in
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.76 con tomb base with food soda and alcohol for all the participants in Operation Tailwind,
01:59:17.76 --> 01:59:26.24 including the aviators from the HMH-5463 unit Scarface Cobra Gunship Cruise Army Cobra Gunship
01:59:26.24 --> 01:59:32.88 Cruise and some Air Force Covey pilots. Somehow the word did not get delivered to the A1
01:59:32.88 --> 01:59:40.72 Spad pilots and ground crews from the Denang base. 47 years later swans and muesd quote,
01:59:40.72 --> 01:59:44.48 it's just as good that we didn't get the word because we were busy supporting other
01:59:44.48 --> 01:59:51.20 sog and sore missions. You know just another day in the Prairie Fire Area of Operations for our
01:59:51.20 --> 01:59:58.88 sky Raiders. End quote, to this day Rose can't touch the thumb on his left hand with his little
01:59:58.88 --> 02:00:04.96 finger due to the serious nerve and muscle damage he received when wounded on day one. On day one.
02:00:07.92 --> 02:00:14.08 So all that medical treatment he provided with no thumb in action. For more than two years
02:00:14.08 --> 02:00:20.32 his wife pulled PUSCO to trap no and bamboo shards from his body stemming from the many times
02:00:20.32 --> 02:00:27.52 he was hit with shrapnel while on the ground. A dare still stuffers from nerve damage to his
02:00:27.52 --> 02:00:37.04 neck left shoulder and arm from Operation Tailwind. But what's crazy is no green braised killed
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:49.84 in action. That's amazing. The reconnified mass. That's just an incredible operation.
02:00:49.84 --> 02:00:59.04 Is so successful as so many levels and the fact that the Hords were coming by day four
02:00:59.04 --> 02:01:04.32 day finally reacting. Many reacted was enough to take the pressure off the CIA operation.
02:01:04.32 --> 02:01:10.88 So they were missing a cop with the bonuses of hitting the command center and then the other
02:01:10.88 --> 02:01:19.84 cache what they blew up with tons of rice weapons trucks etc. The fireworks went on for quite
02:01:19.84 --> 02:01:30.40 a while. They might be out of base camp in the spare time. Amazing. And I mean just the
02:01:30.40 --> 02:01:40.64 the mission focus from Maccarley just to get you look we get shot at while we're on insert.
02:01:40.64 --> 02:01:45.20 Yeah we got PUSCO going. We get contacted we're still going we get wounded we're still going
02:01:45.20 --> 02:01:50.08 we get more wounded we're still going. We find an enemy base camp are we going to
02:01:50.08 --> 02:01:54.88 are we going to back away? No we're going to attack it. Yeah we're going to keep going.
02:01:54.88 --> 02:02:01.60 He's relentless told me relentless. Oh I think example of a guy learned from the a.o.
02:02:01.60 --> 02:02:07.52 Applied in the field and then do it at such a level. No always change the direction so the
02:02:07.52 --> 02:02:13.68 NVA wouldn't be sure where they're gone and moving at night at night. You guys didn't move
02:02:13.68 --> 02:02:19.52 much at night normally. Recall we never did a couple of guys may have gone away with that but not us.
02:02:19.52 --> 02:02:25.52 No when we were at night we we honkered down and they had good enough weather that they could
02:02:26.32 --> 02:02:34.48 click in with you know specter shadow, stinger and it made a difference and we may have
02:02:34.48 --> 02:02:40.32 downplayed a caigine everybody couldn't even remember how many gunships they went through at night
02:02:40.32 --> 02:02:46.16 but every night they went through all they used them. Seals moved at night during Vietnam.
02:02:46.16 --> 02:02:51.68 That was like one of the things that they did that was like outside the box you know
02:02:52.32 --> 02:02:56.32 was they that's what that's one of the things that they did was they moved at night.
02:02:56.32 --> 02:02:58.16 I don't know how they did it but they did it. Yeah.
02:03:03.44 --> 02:03:08.96 Now you kind of you kind of referred to this earlier these guys do this beyond heroic
02:03:08.96 --> 02:03:14.08 operation of course no one ever hears about it because it's soggy you guys all signed at 20
02:03:14.08 --> 02:03:23.44 year you know oath of silence on this stuff and all the air crews were told before they went in
02:03:23.44 --> 02:03:30.56 everybody you know of course they won a sky-rated people they wasn't S.O.P. with them
02:03:30.56 --> 02:03:35.44 but there's a lot of new troops coming down there but the hill cop the crews the
02:03:35.44 --> 02:03:41.36 co-operations even though they you know scar face had been doing across the fence
02:03:41.36 --> 02:03:46.32 missions for a long time they were all brief when we're done here you don't talk about it.
02:03:47.20 --> 02:03:52.40 Yeah and and we kind of breeze through it but also you heard Maccarly say that I think it was
02:03:52.40 --> 02:03:57.92 Maccarly say that because it was so secretive these a lot of these pilots they didn't get any
02:03:57.92 --> 02:04:03.60 recognition at all. I mean you're freaking flying a helicopter into an LZ where there's massive
02:04:03.60 --> 02:04:10.56 machine gun fire to extract guys I mean that's just insane bravery. Right and know again the beauty
02:04:10.56 --> 02:04:17.04 of talking to people after you write the book I taught the Tom Stump and Gene on that one
02:04:17.04 --> 02:04:23.52 point when they were together we had a reunion a tailwind reunion a few years ago in Tennessee
02:04:24.32 --> 02:04:31.60 and their Gene Maccarly said had you not done that we would have been done right then and
02:04:31.60 --> 02:04:36.64 because they were really up against the wave attacks but at point and they're low in ammo
02:04:36.64 --> 02:04:42.32 and Tom Stump he said you literally say they're ass right there and he came through the clouds
02:04:42.32 --> 02:04:50.08 somehow these A1 piles and Tom Stump those guys how they get through the clouds to get down to
02:04:50.08 --> 02:04:59.20 be critical mass danger close and to save their ass I mean and they're just wonderful we just love
02:04:59.20 --> 02:05:06.64 that's why we feel like the sky-rated piles were saints. Yeah the the seals had a relationship like
02:05:06.64 --> 02:05:11.84 like that with the with the sea wolves the the nature of the copper pilots and we've had a couple
02:05:11.84 --> 02:05:18.56 sea wolves on here and a legend freaking badass same thing same they were going like if they got the
02:05:18.56 --> 02:05:22.80 call they were going that's all there was to it scrambled the sea wolves all right cool what he got
02:05:22.80 --> 02:05:27.12 what we're gonna get you out and the sea wolf history is they were kind of like treated like
02:05:27.12 --> 02:05:32.48 Steph Jeff for sure they had to go out scrouse the whole time and yet when it came time those guys flew
02:05:32.48 --> 02:05:41.28 and they were good another legend absolutely man can heroic oh yes so these guys do this heroic
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:45.76 operation and you mentioned this earlier and I'm gonna go to the book 28 years after one of the
02:05:45.76 --> 02:05:51.76 most successful operations run in the 1970 run in 1970 during the eight-year secret war operation
02:05:51.76 --> 02:05:59.60 tailwind CNN that's the cable new news network broadcast a disgraceful erroneous story that
02:05:59.60 --> 02:06:05.04 stained the reputation of the men who participated in that mission portraying them as war criminals
02:06:05.04 --> 02:06:10.96 and set a reporting the facts of the successful mission CNN accused the green berets and airmen of
02:06:10.96 --> 02:06:19.52 gassing American POWs held captive in louss with deadly seren gas CNN used that air laden net
02:06:19.52 --> 02:06:26.72 work work a fiction in an effort to compete with CBS's popular 60-minute program when it launched a
02:06:26.72 --> 02:06:34.40 new program on June 7 1998 called new stand the title of the bogus slanderist story entitled
02:06:35.36 --> 02:06:42.88 Valley of Death it alleged that 16 green berets and 120-indiged troops from operation tailwind
02:06:42.88 --> 02:06:47.68 had destroyed a village and killed innocent women and children while directing US aircraft the
02:06:47.68 --> 02:06:53.76 drop lethal seren nerve gas on US war defectors they said were POWs of the communist
02:06:54.40 --> 02:07:00.000 to compound the egregious attack against America's finest soldiers in airmen the next day
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.88 time magazine repeated the hideous allegations in the news story written by CNN staff members
02:07:06.88 --> 02:07:16.24 headline did the US drop nerve gas it was written by CNN producer all April Oliver and CNN
02:07:16.24 --> 02:07:24.48 international correspondent Peter Arneut who produced the CNN story that aired June 7th the broadcast
02:07:24.48 --> 02:07:29.44 and time article smeared the men of operation tailwind which was conducted
02:07:30.40 --> 02:07:35.84 during the eight-year secret war in louss during the Vietnam War and run under the ages of military
02:07:35.84 --> 02:07:48.56 assistance command Vietnam studies an operation group or simply sog there was an additional political
02:07:48.56 --> 02:07:57.36 ramification stemming from the CNN time magazine report in 1998 at a July 21st 1998 press conference
02:07:57.36 --> 02:08:03.92 repudiating the CNN time report then secretary defense William Cohen said quote the charge would
02:08:03.92 --> 02:08:10.56 be used to discredit the united states attempt to curb the proliferation periffelation of weapons
02:08:10.56 --> 02:08:17.20 of mass destruction in fact Iraq immediately incorporated CNN's charges into its anti-use
02:08:17.20 --> 02:08:24.16 anti-US propaganda effort to try and deflect attention from its own outlawed chemical and biological
02:08:24.16 --> 02:08:32.000 weapons programs end quote. Cohen ordered a full scale across the board investigation of the CNN
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:38.32 time story from all military branches involved in operation tailwind while requesting at the same
02:08:38.32 --> 02:08:44.56 time from the CIA and the joint chiefs of staffs of course these guys found up you know reported
02:08:44.56 --> 02:08:50.48 what had really happened and then there's some retractions and some apologies
02:08:53.60 --> 02:08:57.84 secretary Cohen said I think all Americans should know that the 16 men who conducted this mission were
02:08:57.84 --> 02:09:03.68 heroes but that that they had been have been hurt by this report I can assure you that you and your
02:09:03.68 --> 02:09:09.28 colleagues and your families you did nothing wrong and he's obviously he's addressing the the men.
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:15.44 Quite the contrary you did everything right 16 Americans fought steadily for four days all of the
02:09:15.44 --> 02:09:21.12 more injured all got out alive the documents that they captured provided intelligence bananza
02:09:21.12 --> 02:09:26.32 general Abrams the commander of our troops in Vietnam said tailwind was a valuable operation
02:09:26.32 --> 02:09:32.56 executed with great scale and tremendous courage. Cohen told reporters that after rigorous review of
02:09:32.56 --> 02:09:36.88 thousands of pages of documents statements and after acting reports the military ordinance and
02:09:36.88 --> 02:09:42.88 weapon storage records quote we found no evidence to support CNN time assertions we have found
02:09:42.88 --> 02:09:48.48 absolutely no evidence to support these charges CNN and time retracted their reports noting
02:09:48.48 --> 02:09:55.84 that they could not support either charge on July 2nd 1998 in a CNN retraction
02:09:55.84 --> 02:10:01.76 CNN news group chairman president CEO Tom Johnson said an independent investigation concluded that
02:10:01.76 --> 02:10:07.28 the report quote cannot be supported there was insufficient evidence that serenor any other deadly
02:10:07.28 --> 02:10:13.52 gas was used and CNN could not confirm that American defectors were targeted at the camp as
02:10:13.52 --> 02:10:20.16 news stand reported we apologize to our viewers and to our colleagues at time for this mistake
02:10:20.16 --> 02:10:26.40 CNN owes a special apology to the personnel involved in operation tailwind both soldiers on the ground
02:10:26.40 --> 02:10:31.92 and the US Air Force pilots and US Marine Corps helicopter pilots who were involved in the action
02:10:33.84 --> 02:10:40.08 on July 13th time magazine printed in apologies to its readers had vined tailwind and apology
02:10:41.12 --> 02:10:46.48 they noted that the allegations reported on June 7th and 8th 1998 could not quote be supported by the
02:10:46.48 --> 02:10:54.24 evidence and quote in July 14th 1998 Ted Turner wrote a letter to Macartley quote I hope you
02:10:54.24 --> 02:11:00.56 accept my personal apology for the CNN newsstands recent erroneous reporting on operation tailwind
02:11:00.56 --> 02:11:05.28 this entire episode has been very painful for me as the founder of CNN however my greatest
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:10.24 distress comes from knowing that our coverage upset those on the front line of operation tailwind
02:11:10.24 --> 02:11:14.72 the soldiers on the ground and the US Air Force and Marine Corps pilots engaged in the
02:11:14.72 --> 02:11:21.44 action and quote Macartley said in a 2015 interview quote I personally spoke to Ted Turner
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.72 and he reiterated that he wrote what he wrote in the letter he also told me he was going to call
02:11:26.72 --> 02:11:32.000 the other members of our team and write them a letters of apology to my best to the best of my
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.24 knowledge that did not happen and quote Larry grow a marine core helicopter door gunner who
02:11:38.24 --> 02:11:44.48 survived the operation tailwind added I felt really betrayed by CNN for allowing those reporters
02:11:44.48 --> 02:11:50.08 to publish all those lies and twisting the statements from those who were interviewed CNN showed me
02:11:50.08 --> 02:11:56.40 how the news media can twist a story to fit its needs and have never really trusted any of the
02:11:56.40 --> 02:11:59.84 other media 100% in their reporting since then.
02:12:02.24 --> 02:12:10.000 Interviewed in 2016 retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Mel Swanson who is the commanding officer
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.24 of the daring A1 Skyrader pilots remain brutally bitter about CNN's false story quote
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:22.32 Operation Tailwind was the classic example of inter-service cooperation in that area of operations
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:27.20 think about it America's finest the green berets and their loyal troops kicked ass and took
02:12:27.20 --> 02:12:32.56 numbers on the ground deep in enemy territory the tactical air support from the Air Force
02:12:32.56 --> 02:12:40.000 fast movers C130 gunships are beloved age A1 H spads in combination with Marine Corps Scarface
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:46.56 Cobre gunships army army cobras and Marine Corps dimmers raised hell in the enemies backyard
02:12:46.56 --> 02:12:52.80 we killed hundreds of these comic bastards and thanks to that green beret medic all were kept alive
02:12:52.80 --> 02:13:00.24 until the final extraction when one montnard soldier was killed until 1998 I occasionally watched
02:13:00.24 --> 02:13:05.76 the communist news network but after they ruined our reputations I never watched again it was a
02:13:05.76 --> 02:13:10.40 crime against our warriors what they did it was a travesty of justice.
02:13:14.72 --> 02:13:23.12 Amen yeah I mean obviously right now we're living in a you know this is 1998 and and the
02:13:23.12 --> 02:13:31.60 media's even more partisan and they take stories all the time and run with these stories and
02:13:31.60 --> 02:13:38.000 and a lot of times it's it happens so much that it's we forget what it does the actual people
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.24 that are victims of the stories these false stories that come out and so you know you get a
02:13:44.24 --> 02:13:50.48 situation like this these guys and you know you know it's thinking about you know Mike Rose
02:13:50.48 --> 02:13:55.76 who who had to make that decision out in the jungle that he's gonna leave you know his his
02:13:55.76 --> 02:14:00.96 his in-ditch troops out there that were dead he's leaving the bodies and he's tore up over that
02:14:00.96 --> 02:14:05.76 for for his whole life since then oh absolutely and then you get a story like this comes out
02:14:06.72 --> 02:14:13.52 it's um yeah it's a it's a travesty and they knew it was coming so I mean they knew it was a
02:14:13.52 --> 02:14:18.56 story coming but they didn't know it's gonna have that negative edge to it and the distorted
02:14:18.56 --> 02:14:25.68 inaccuracies so somebody's got lined up their families set down a front to TV Mike Hagen
02:14:25.68 --> 02:14:31.20 and Mike Rose were two of the come to mind right away because they had their files hey we're
02:14:31.20 --> 02:14:37.12 gonna be all seen and then tonight and then halfway through the broadcast when that true tone comes out
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:43.36 and the founder of the cell like your work criminals and and then Mike had to explain to his
02:14:43.36 --> 02:14:51.36 daughter Mike Rose and he was just devastated and he had to sit there and try to explain to you
02:14:51.36 --> 02:14:58.16 and these kids see things on TV TV's never wrong and look at dad with a little bit of cross-eyed
02:14:58.16 --> 02:15:16.32 but horribly impact on a personal level nobody ever hears about you alluded to this earlier because
02:15:16.32 --> 02:15:22.40 of the secrecy of sock and what you guys were doing there's a bunch of reasons because the
02:15:22.40 --> 02:15:29.28 secrecy of sock because the number of guys that were doing turnover so you got guys coming in
02:15:29.28 --> 02:15:34.24 and leaving and then the number guys that are wounded the number of guys that are killed the number
02:15:34.24 --> 02:15:41.52 guys that are missing there's a lot of sock operators that as as we mentioned earlier never
02:15:41.52 --> 02:15:46.72 met the pilots that were supporting them and so you'd get these guys and never seen yeah
02:15:46.72 --> 02:15:52.96 but then and you again you alluded this to this earlier in 2016 go into the book the first
02:15:52.96 --> 02:15:58.08 operation tailwind reunion was held at the Tennessee Museum of Aviation bringing together for the
02:15:58.08 --> 02:16:03.28 first time in more than 45 years some of the men from all of the aviation units and some of the
02:16:03.28 --> 02:16:10.000 special forces soldiers from that unique mission featuring B company commander Jean McCartley the
02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:17.60 commanding officer of the A1 skyrators Mel Swanson and the pilots who flew Marine Corps cobre gunships
02:16:17.60 --> 02:16:24.08 from Scarface the CH53 pilots and a few forward air controllers with tears in his eyes
02:16:24.08 --> 02:16:29.68 Swanson said I hope this is the first of more reunions like it to see how grateful the men of
02:16:29.68 --> 02:16:36.000 sock were for our support during those hairy pre-refire missions touches me through and through
02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.60 as well as the other pilots here today we always wondered who those crazy fuckers on the ground
02:16:41.60 --> 02:16:47.28 were and now thanks to the reunions and this reunion we get to meet them and I can't tell you how
02:16:47.28 --> 02:16:52.96 much this means to me on a personal level is the as the commander who sent our A1 pilots into harm's
02:16:52.96 --> 02:16:58.64 way every day to learn how much they appreciated us in the a.o. it's gratifying beyond words
02:16:58.64 --> 02:17:09.12 Scarface pilot Barry Pensick am I saying that right just handshake Pensick Pensick
02:17:10.32 --> 02:17:17.04 Scarface pilot Barry Pensick told the audience that when the Marines went across the fence
02:17:17.04 --> 02:17:22.88 into louse quote they made us change our call sign for some reason they called them mission 72
02:17:22.88 --> 02:17:28.32 when we went across the fence whenever we ran a mission 72 for some reason they had us take
02:17:28.32 --> 02:17:34.80 off our dog tags leave our wall at home so you couldn't be identified as if you go down in an
02:17:34.80 --> 02:17:39.84 American made helicopter and you're a white brown-go-right guy round eye in an Asian country and
02:17:39.84 --> 02:17:48.80 no one's gonna know you're American I never understood the logic of that then in a closing note
02:17:48.80 --> 02:17:54.56 Pensick turned to the audience and apologized to the ladies and advanced for contaminating
02:17:54.56 --> 02:18:00.08 the spoken word with profanities to summarize the time he spent during that operation I can't
02:18:00.08 --> 02:18:07.44 think of another way to say this he said apologetically for example if someone is really good he's a hot
02:18:07.44 --> 02:18:15.76 shit if something was good it was shit hot if you get into a bad situation it was a shit sandwich
02:18:16.64 --> 02:18:22.16 Don Persky mentioned the same which we got into earlier if you had your act together you had your shit
02:18:22.16 --> 02:18:28.88 together and I would like to say that I was honored to have a week or so to spend with all these people
02:18:28.88 --> 02:18:35.12 here and a bunch of others and that they were a bunch of hot shit guys on a shit hot mission
02:18:35.12 --> 02:18:42.40 and that we got into a shit sandwich but we had our shit together in the end no shit airborne
02:18:42.40 --> 02:18:55.52 is that a great line or that is a great line that is a great line so you know one thing I want to
02:18:55.52 --> 02:19:03.44 mention is that Mike Rosen on October 23rd 2017 received the the Medal of Honor oh yeah
02:19:04.48 --> 02:19:11.76 so that's the White House for President Trump and it shows you that you know even though it wasn't
02:19:11.76 --> 02:19:18.08 known about at the time the heroism of these guys was just well that's the highest honor that
02:19:18.08 --> 02:19:29.92 that that that person can be can receive so salute to those guys and and man what a mission now
02:19:31.28 --> 02:19:34.88 I'm going to jump ahead and look we're we're not covering all of soccer on the
02:19:34.88 --> 02:19:41.68 circles by the way that was one mission to cover in this volume one of song chronicles um but one of the
02:19:41.68 --> 02:19:47.52 things that when I started reading I read a quote that said you know as of June 13 2017
02:19:47.52 --> 02:19:53.60 there were still 50 green berets listed as MIA in Lousalone along with at least 105 aviators who
02:19:53.60 --> 02:20:00.16 died supporting song missions they are among the total of approximately 260 aviators mission
02:20:00.16 --> 02:20:09.44 missing in Lousalone as of this printing now there's a there's a story in here and I don't
02:20:09.44 --> 02:20:15.84 want to go through the whole thing um because people should get the book and read through it
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:23.84 but on a high level because it ties into the you know this the MIAs that are still out there
02:20:23.84 --> 02:20:30.000 can you tell us a little bit about RT and truetor and and what happened on that on that operation
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:38.08 I'll sure um they went into the target and um made enemy contact and uh they had to
02:20:38.08 --> 02:20:44.48 pull that on strings so the first helicopter came in pulled out the first half of the team RT and
02:20:44.48 --> 02:20:50.72 truetor the second helicopter came in again with strings the pull them out and they had two Americans
02:20:52.48 --> 02:20:56.40 three Americans are on on the strings and maybe one of the days I forget about the
02:20:56.40 --> 02:21:03.20 indigenous and as they're lifting off one of Robskot Tangled the trees and Sammy Hernandez
02:21:03.20 --> 02:21:09.60 felt at a ground with knocked on conscious so he's on conscious helicopter continues up gets hammered
02:21:10.40 --> 02:21:16.56 turns around spins out of control and then crashed into a granite wall or to a mountain
02:21:17.20 --> 02:21:24.88 killing the entire air crew everybody on the ropes so the next day uh the bright light goes in
02:21:24.88 --> 02:21:34.000 and um maybe in the day or two days later the bright light goes in they get to the crash site
02:21:34.72 --> 02:21:41.60 and they're able to recover all the bodies Sammy Hernandez during the night woke up
02:21:41.60 --> 02:21:48.000 played hiding go seek with the NVA found a uh found a cave or some kind of area where you get out
02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:54.64 away and before we went into the cave he his shoulder was dislocated so he pounded his shoulder
02:21:54.64 --> 02:22:02.24 back into place on a tree then he hid for the night in the morning it first light a cubby came by
02:22:02.24 --> 02:22:06.96 and he had his panel and they were able to strapped him out they came in with the bright light
02:22:07.60 --> 02:22:12.48 got all the bodies put him into body bags moving to a location I forgive they got to the top
02:22:12.48 --> 02:22:18.56 of the mountain or not but Cliff Newman was on that mission and um they went in
02:22:18.56 --> 02:22:24.000 put together of you all the bodies but it was too dark they couldn't come in and get him out
02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.36 that night the plan was in the morning they'll come in early well in the morning before any
02:22:29.36 --> 02:22:35.92 aircraft could get there any aircraft cover the NVA hit that team hard and bottle line they couldn't get
02:22:35.92 --> 02:22:43.44 the body sound they'd literally left them there um 35 40 years later Cliff Newman goes back
02:22:43.44 --> 02:22:53.52 in an effort to work with our uh what's now DPA department PLAW MIA County HC and it was the
02:22:53.52 --> 02:23:01.20 predecessor but Cliff went in try to find it they cooperation with the uh in business people
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:06.56 uh forgive with the lay oceans or the Vietnamese they put them in too far away from the mountain
02:23:06.56 --> 02:23:13.68 they so Cliff went back four or five years ago again the second time and again there are
02:23:13.68 --> 02:23:21.92 two far away so Cliff is waiting for the third call to go back and uh try to help him and this is the
02:23:21.92 --> 02:23:28.72 dedication of Cliff and uh Sammy Hernandez is still alive and of course Cliff Newman was uh and Sammy
02:23:28.72 --> 02:23:35.60 we're on the first team that did the first Halo jump in the layhouse well that's one of the other
02:23:35.60 --> 02:23:40.32 reasons why I don't want to go too much deep detail right now because hopefully we get them on here
02:23:40.32 --> 02:23:47.44 to tell the story oh come back yeah you know and you you think about that you know I just was
02:23:47.44 --> 02:23:54.24 looking through um some of this information Americans Unaccounted for in Southeast Asia
02:23:54.24 --> 02:24:13.44 right now um total of 1,587 and post January 1973 they've repatriated 1,059 from Vietnam, China,
02:24:13.44 --> 02:24:23.36 Laos and Cambodia so we still have work to do there to get these guys back home yeah and even on that
02:24:23.36 --> 02:24:30.96 mission there um the morning that they went in to get to we to pull the recon team out when
02:24:30.96 --> 02:24:38.48 after the recon teams hit we had a cubby that went in and got shot down and they lost all of
02:24:38.48 --> 02:24:45.44 everybody's killed and they um they couldn't get them out right away but eventually I think
02:24:45.44 --> 02:24:53.84 it would now be maybe 10 years ago they got the pile out to recover this body and um so today yeah
02:24:53.84 --> 02:25:01.92 the one thousand five hundred eighty six remaining uh MIAs in Southeast Asia which includes Vietnam
02:25:01.92 --> 02:25:13.44 Laos, Cambodia and China and they're a few of their um piles mostly assume and uh September 18th
02:25:13.44 --> 02:25:21.36 will be the Peel the National Peel WMIA recognition day when there'll be vent held across the
02:25:21.36 --> 02:25:29.20 country and of course you have the iconic Peel WMIA flag that's now uh but authorized by President
02:25:29.20 --> 02:25:34.48 Trump to be flown off federal buildings throughout the year now every day trying to keep
02:25:34.48 --> 02:25:44.48 attention focused at that level um anything that we can do to help out on that stuff um
02:25:44.48 --> 02:25:50.08 boom well there's a lot of issues attached to it but the most important thing is to keep um
02:25:51.68 --> 02:25:56.000 keep people writing their congressmen and say please keep the efforts going forward on this for
02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:01.68 the for the Americans from Southeast Asia because what's working against this in addition
02:26:02.32 --> 02:26:08.08 Mother Nature again is the most acidic soil in the world eventually eats up bones maybe teeth
02:26:09.04 --> 02:26:18.40 and so um who knows how much longer the remains will be and um you know for my case we
02:26:18.40 --> 02:26:25.92 a spider-pat walk in the land black the MIA is the people we knew who our teammates they're now part of that
02:26:26.56 --> 02:26:32.88 and we still hope the someday at least get the remains back someday maybe not I think there's going
02:26:32.88 --> 02:26:39.20 to have to be somebody somewhere it's going to say we have to end it but until they do um the
02:26:40.24 --> 02:26:45.60 what's really amazing the young teams that they get out there for DPA they're dedicated these kids
02:26:45.60 --> 02:26:53.68 go out their army marine corps they usually take a medic an sf medic with them now and these
02:26:53.68 --> 02:27:00.000 kids are dedicated they really do a great job we like to see a little bit more coming from mid-management
02:27:00.64 --> 02:27:06.80 at DPA turns into commitment they're really pushed this thing keep it in public side
02:27:07.68 --> 02:27:13.36 and and the president Trump's been supportive of it and um that's what we can do we're at the
02:27:13.36 --> 02:27:20.72 uh we're at the mercy of time here and the effort yeah I know they would send guys I know guys
02:27:20.72 --> 02:27:26.56 in the sealed teams friends of mine that would go to Vietnam to support those operations look oh yeah
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:34.32 it's like no inter-service rye over here no for all Americans no matter what service and it's been
02:27:34.32 --> 02:27:41.60 teams that've gone in for over 40 years now you know I forget the exact date but I think it's June
02:27:41.60 --> 02:27:48.72 no they always stopped to talk about the aircraft that was a j-pack aircraft loaded with people
02:27:48.72 --> 02:27:54.96 going for a mission aircraft and we lost several Americans as well as indigenous people working
02:27:54.96 --> 02:28:02.56 with us on that so it's a deadly mission it's been a long battle and do you have the uh the

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:02.32 means is this guy is 23 yeah you know this guy is not an old experienced pilot with thousands of
02:33:02.32 --> 02:33:10.40 flight hours he's 23 but like you said he might not have time but he's got ice he has blood
02:33:10.40 --> 02:33:15.28 totally out there in a hold station with a freaking helicopter while you're taking

02:33:34.16 --> 02:33:40.48 took off and continued to fight you know you you you talk with such a reverence for all the other
02:33:40.48 --> 02:33:44.88 service branches and it's the same you know when when when we were in the battle of Ramadi
02:33:45.60 --> 02:33:51.04 there was just no rivalry whatsoever and I've never had I didn't really have some big rivalry going
02:33:51.04 --> 02:33:55.36 into it I'd never really cared I was thought we were on the same team but some people some people
02:33:55.36 --> 02:34:00.96 take that stuff pretty seriously but man on the ground in the battle of Ramadi it was just
02:34:00.96 --> 02:34:06.40 brothers and and across the board and sisters as well because there's females they're fighting
02:34:06.40 --> 02:34:14.16 and females that were killed in action and but just nothing but reverence for the soldiers
02:34:14.16 --> 02:34:20.000 the sailors the airman marines that we work with salute to all of them and and certainly I know
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:27.36 you feel the same way as you talk but hey once again thanks for coming back we got to get the

02:35:13.20 --> 02:35:23.52 unbelievable opportunity to sit here and talk to these guys and learn these stories so many
02:35:23.52 --> 02:35:28.80 stories you know after we after we turned off the mics I started getting kind of crazy talking to
02:35:28.80 --> 02:35:34.72 tilt I was saying hey when you're talking about 600 hand grenades getting thrown each one of
02:35:34.72 --> 02:35:40.32 those hand grenades that gets thrown by the enemy into your position is a whole story there's a whole
02:35:40.32 --> 02:35:45.92 story behind it hey grenade you know right where to come from I got them over there
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:52.32 start putting down fire I'm like that's a whole story each one oh god wait Jimmy's wounded each one
02:35:52.32 --> 02:36:02.40 of these events 600 grenades each one of those events is a micro story yeah each one of these hey
02:36:02.40 --> 02:36:09.92 in in two lines in this book that we just read in two lines it's like um hey there was
02:36:09.92 --> 02:36:17.12 enemy bunkers who were cleared by the montn yards yeah wait wait a second that's a freaking
02:36:17.12 --> 02:36:22.40 chapter two chapters or three chapters or a whole book in itself clearing up enemy bunker
02:36:23.12 --> 02:36:30.72 filled with the or the NVA fighters what's happening what are we talking about so
02:36:31.44 --> 02:36:35.60 to be able to sit here and talk to these guys and and and tilt wasn't on that particular mission
02:36:35.60 --> 02:36:43.12 but he has you know he has first hand experience in the a.o he lived through it and it's just awesome
02:36:43.12 --> 02:36:48.88 so I appreciate the opportunity to do this and and one of the reasons we have the opportunity this
02:36:48.88 --> 02:36:56.48 is because y'all give us support support support support as we like to call it echo somebody wants to
02:36:56.48 --> 02:37:02.56 support this podcast here and while they're supporting this podcast they actually want to provide
02:37:02.56 --> 02:37:09.92 themselves with some support yep is it closer support not really but it could be considered
02:37:11.36 --> 02:37:17.44 on some level it is well let's just say this it might not be closer support but it is definitely
02:37:17.44 --> 02:37:24.16 support it is support for sure and you know for one self you know to support others you do have to
02:37:24.16 --> 02:37:30.16 support yourself right like I said I said it before I say it again it's like you know when you're in the
02:37:30.16 --> 02:37:35.68 airplane and oxygen mask comes down what are they instructed you to do put on yourself then you
02:37:35.68 --> 02:37:41.60 help your small infant child whatever the case so kind of the same situation all right so we're
02:37:41.60 --> 02:37:47.36 working out we're keeping ourselves on the path on the path isn't just such some so-tark thing
02:37:47.36 --> 02:37:55.28 by the way it's keeping your shit together dang I like it it is 100% in every way you can by the way
02:37:55.28 --> 02:38:01.84 mental physical uh social social meaning like this your relationships with people in and outside
02:38:01.84 --> 02:38:05.92 your family anyway you understand you're gonna know if you're doing something off the path versus
02:38:05.92 --> 02:38:14.88 something on the path you're gonna know pretty clear so anyway so when working out we could benefit
02:38:14.88 --> 02:38:22.48 from supplementation we could use some air support some air so 11 of support yes there you go support
02:38:22.48 --> 02:38:28.88 is way better than no support yes it is 100% so jocco has you covered we have you covered we all
02:38:28.88 --> 02:38:34.40 have ourselves covered as well jocco fuel supplementation for you joints important they're
02:38:34.40 --> 02:38:42.32 important okay so I'm I'm I'm not one of these guys who have these crazy joint problems but
02:38:43.28 --> 02:38:48.08 from time to time I'll get jammed up you know the kind when you wake up you walk down stairs
02:38:48.08 --> 02:38:54.32 if you walk down stairs too quick you're like you can feel it you seem saying you didn't know what I'm
02:38:54.32 --> 02:38:58.80 talking about you don't feel that that's what you say I certainly don't admit it
02:39:01.20 --> 02:39:05.76 I thought we were all friends here you know but I will say and the point to this and the
02:39:05.76 --> 02:39:12.48 quasi story is that when you think back to those times when you're like all stiff or whatever just
02:39:12.48 --> 02:39:18.80 general stiffness and now you don't have it it's like it's it's a godsend this is what it is
02:39:20.16 --> 02:39:27.04 you don't miss those days we don't want to feel it yeah and it's it's not a big deal when you
02:39:27.04 --> 02:39:32.56 forget it when you don't realize it it seems saying but anyway I realize it a lot so that's why
02:39:32.56 --> 02:39:38.80 it is important to keep taking your joint warfare and cruel oil those are for your joints discipline
02:39:38.80 --> 02:39:47.52 discipline go this is the brain body supplement keep you mentally in the game keep you sharp you have a
02:39:47.52 --> 02:39:57.04 groggy day boom helps you out that is also RTD can it's like an energy drink in the form of
02:39:58.64 --> 02:40:03.44 like a bad word it's like an energy drink is something that you drink that makes you feel good for
02:40:03.44 --> 02:40:09.28 45 minutes until you crash and burn and you have a freaking insulin level spike yeah and you feel like
02:40:09.28 --> 02:40:16.96 crap because it's filled with sugar and a bunch of chemicals what's going on here no sugar
02:40:17.68 --> 02:40:22.40 no sugar well how does it taste good because it's sweet and with something else called monk fruit which is actually
02:40:22.40 --> 02:40:29.36 good for you it doesn't have 700 milligrams of caffeine no it's got 95 milligrams of caffeine yes good for you
02:40:29.36 --> 02:40:39.92 you get that little afternoony hitter yes so to sum it up I guess it's a brain health drink
02:40:40.48 --> 02:40:48.48 in the form of an energy drink loosely we'll say loosely we haven't figured out what exactly
02:40:48.48 --> 02:40:55.36 we've made it's a new category potentially yeah it's good nonetheless got some good flavors on
02:40:55.36 --> 02:41:01.60 there good some flavors coming up oh as well it's so exciting not there you go I'm not saying it's my
02:41:01.60 --> 02:41:07.36 new flavor I'm not saying it's not my new for I'm just saying we have some various flavors coming up
02:41:07.36 --> 02:41:11.92 anyway yes that's discipline and discipline go there's also the the capsules you know if you're
02:41:11.92 --> 02:41:18.96 in a in a rush or would have you yeah there's that also vitamin D3 and cold war this is for immunity
02:41:18.96 --> 02:41:26.56 so keeping your immune system is keeping it up keeping it strong that's important definitely
02:41:26.56 --> 02:41:34.24 as opposed to unimposed especially right now yes well I don't want to get into a whole debate
02:41:35.20 --> 02:41:41.04 but I think that immune system is important at all times okay that's what I think I'm going with it
02:41:41.04 --> 02:41:47.60 all right I'm very very cool also what we got milk jocco milk protein in the form of dessert
02:41:47.60 --> 02:41:53.44 all different or dessert in the form of protein you know what I'm saying yes they do yeah
02:41:53.44 --> 02:41:59.68 same deal with some new flavors coming out and I'll tell you what I'll tell you what we got
02:41:59.68 --> 02:42:08.56 some flavors coming out oh for oh yes yes and they are legit legit you want to know what one of
02:42:08.56 --> 02:42:18.72 them is yeah smashing pumpkin it's like I didn't even know what this was yes yeah I didn't even know
02:42:18.72 --> 02:42:23.20 what this was I didn't even know what this thing yeah be a little sensitive to me he goes he goes
02:42:23.20 --> 02:42:27.84 dude you gotta try this and I'm like send it yeah it sends it out and I wasn't even I didn't even
02:42:27.84 --> 02:42:38.16 know I liked this flavor smashing pumpkins yeah but well smashing pumpkins is a band yeah
02:42:38.16 --> 02:42:42.64 okay you already knew that your fan you're a smash pumpkin absolutely yeah me too actually
02:42:42.64 --> 02:42:49.36 anyway that's a band pumpkin spice the flavor is like a thing like oh yeah and I didn't know that
02:42:49.36 --> 02:42:54.48 yeah and that makes sense because I mean I knew of it but just in the past like few years or whatever
02:42:54.48 --> 02:43:02.08 it's been getting a lot of like teasing and stuff like oh pumpkin spice I don't you know
02:43:02.08 --> 02:43:08.08 that I don't know anything about that I know yeah I mean I have to pull this flavor down because it's a week no I
02:43:08.08 --> 02:43:14.24 think like since it's been in the what he call like spotlight or whatever and people will be like
02:43:14.24 --> 02:43:18.72 oh I don't know it's like they've been teasing it for some reason like you're some prep you
02:43:18.72 --> 02:43:23.36 okay well you can tease pumpkin spice but trust me you're not going to tease smashing pumpkin
02:43:23.36 --> 02:43:28.88 well here's the way you also said smashing pumpkins that's plural that's a band that's not the

02:43:33.36 --> 02:43:39.44 want to in fringe no no no you don't know you don't know in fringe but no the pumpkin spice so
02:43:39.44 --> 02:43:44.48 that's the thing where it's almost like part of the reason or part of the whole teasing
02:43:44.48 --> 02:43:50.000 culture of it for lack of a better way of putting it um was that everyone likes pumpkin spice
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.08 but you know like it's like if you're like tough you don't want to like admit it like everyone
02:43:54.08 --> 02:43:59.76 it pumps the spice freaking delicious in your cafe latte or whatever like whatever it's always
02:43:59.76 --> 02:44:03.52 still everyone knows that you know that's like kind of the thing that's why I'm I'm going to be
