Yeah, I know like the even if it like again go back to everyone being stoic Right, it'd be like it'd be reduced It would be less of a show and in fact you might even argue that it's kind of has as We've seen that before like in just like other like you ever watch like like a Crati tournament or something like that. Oh, yeah, your your chances of success especially as time goes on go go way down But most people if they're like primarily striking or striking is there kind of their their success You know, that's what gives them success they have to learn even like a Few fundamentals in grappling and get really good at them just defensively to start with but if you don't know anything Like if you know how to defend the take down that's grappling right there yeah a big one is like Keep your ears like open, you know, don't don't be that guy like you always say this word don't be the guy Be like what if I just do this you know kind of they like what it does more if you just go in to solicitor Just listen and we've totally had to like get access to the restaurant after hours and like all this stuff Schedule with Kenny not to mention who is like you know this is like after he crossed over into straight-up mainstream You can't just get Kenny Florian off of you know he had chosen like he's kind of a high level guy at this time but that's that's literally life That's like why that's why you want to watch it because of the big part of it is because of the job Chill son and wise man right said one time once one fight ends That's when the promotion for the next fight begins so that you know when he gets on the mic after the fight is done He's essentially promoting the next one and but and the thing is it's totally proven like you even like Someone saying why do you kid why like people coming to you see why are you supporting Connor? and So these guys are just basically punching each other in the face Any other in the face bleeding like all over you know like super bloody the kind of where they got to stop the fight And like hey doctor check this guy that you know, so he gives you a doctor. Yeah, or they incapacitate them as bad as you know something I said on when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast I was like if you go watch when any of those other sports when they escalate They escalate to what you actually want to see which is MMA Like what happens when a basketball game gets a little too rough they fight each other What happens when hockey gets a little bit today fight each other what happens when football gets a little bit too rough They fight even baseball someone someone does something out alive and baseball they fight each other right like I like hey just like no this is just gonna be What is gonna be playing if I was if I was in charge of the entire UFC What would it look like and it would probably just be? I wish was maybe a little bit more into it, you know Like what should I do or so or whatever maybe not even that they just said Like you jump in there You know, so it's like it's because a lot of times And there was two like immediate thoughts behind that was number one like, hey, you know, first of all, we lost our bros like there nothing lucky about that was the first immediate thought in my head was like, hey man. You know, that, you know, that actually, when we came, when tasking a bruiser came home from Iraq, there was, you know, people like all he got super lucky on that deployment because we got a lot of action, right? and you can tell Brad that guys like every time I did stuff with chelsoon video watch right and put like full on accommodating like come like overly polite person in ways that he doesn't have to do that You don't have to do this polite stuff. He was sitting there like hey, all right That's a bummer and Kabib got nuts for those moments and I don't know what's gonna happen I don't know what's gonna happen in terms of I know they didn't they But he's not like like bisming will actively just like chelsoon and just like a T or T they'll actively play the bad guy Just a little bit but to the point where they will be categorized is that Like even as much as like a year ago, it was like, oh, this guy got this crazy heal hook in the guy tapped and you didn't know what was happening. Yeah, I'm gonna tell you and I won't be annoyed at all if you tell me if you say it to me like you just Uncovered the secret key of jitzu I'm gonna be slightly annoyed you won't know it, but I'll just be like oh, yeah, well here you go Here's what you do. and you know those obviously like a quote I'm called branding play you know we want to kind of go mainstream with the sport edge of it, and you know Make it a kind of a whole So I see Some white belt blow them in the chain of commands going all crazy grabbing their sleeve and this Leader on the top like it gets concerned about it and puts time and effort into something that doesn't matter Whether it's a little personality rub a little ego uprising It's like should we do it this way or should we do it that way doesn't matter that's a little sleeve grab it doesn't matter That's gonna help you a lot but that's grappling now what if you Essentially fail at defending the take down meaning you get taken down you have to learn to get back up If you don't you'll get held down they're straight up if you don't like take a big strong guy and just a normal size person When I know you do put the big strong guy on his back like even in guard Yeah, what other thing is like that the kids want to have it as bad as the parents because like the kids want ice cream They want it bad the kids the parents don't want to grab it. no way I got parents to say their kids say don't know warrior kid won't do that Like when they read warrior kid their voice goes from like hey dad. You know, like, you know, some guy goes on the news, right with his baskets that he makes, you know, whatever. Yeah, moke is good protein on the one not tell you what now we just came out with Warrior kid moke and Did the right thing and and truly this is Awesome and I'll tell you why it's awesome because kids need good food kids need healthy food and they're not gonna Eat healthy food if it tastes like junk and You know they can keep going you know when you gas and was this bowl going to kind of what your strategy was If a grappler gases he grappler gases and that goes for anyone in a fight if you gas out your your essentially In effect, but so kind of that aside the the the reason that Pete that it seems like my first time fighting his blue belt I'm 17 years old and he's beating everyone super easy to by the way and these are adults 25 to six years old and he's just beating them so he gets his purple belt right right away Unless he's in one of these situations where they actually make you be blue belt for two years You know sometimes there's that like I think I'd be JJ F does that sometimes competing was anyway and and that's not like that Rare of a story because and even just how our gym is laid out where you know the kids guys is going on Hey, just just look right behind you right now right behind you So you can just let let your kids go. Like yeah, but even in grappling tournaments, the guy will be like, hey, I'm going to go, and I'm going to get this guy in a Rural naked choke, that's what I'm going to do. yeah, very much they very much to compliment what I didn't the whole mental Like curcumin And Criloil this big like massage for your brain and getting everything so anyways So try those those we get great feedback on those all the time also got the discipline which is for pre-mission Nutrition when you need to do something both cognitive and physical we got your back on this one Three scoops. it's it's actually getting printed at this time and In order to pull this off in order to actually know how many books I need to print I think it already looks like I need to print more books because you all ordered a lot of them already so thank you Preorder so that I know what to print
