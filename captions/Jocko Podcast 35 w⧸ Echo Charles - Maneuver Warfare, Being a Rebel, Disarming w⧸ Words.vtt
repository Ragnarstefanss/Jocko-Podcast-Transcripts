00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.80
This is Jocco podcast number 35 with echo Charles and me

2
00:00:06.60 --> 00:00:08.60
Jocco willing

3
00:00:08.60 --> 00:00:10.60
Good evening, I go good evening

4
00:00:14.48 --> 00:00:19.84
Weeper was ahead when he and born reach the gap in the wire

5
00:00:20.64 --> 00:00:26.76
Starshell after Starshell was going up now and the whole line had woken up machine guns were talking

6
00:00:26.76 --> 00:00:32.76
But there was one that would not talk the rattle of musketry continued

7
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:37.24
But the mist was kindly to them and had thickened again

8
00:00:39.24 --> 00:00:45.000
As they got beyond the trampling clutching wire born saw weeper a couple of pieces ahead of him and

9
00:00:45.92 --> 00:00:50.92
What he thought was the last of their party disappearing into the mist about 20 yards away?

10
00:00:50.92 --> 00:00:58.88
He was glad to be clear of the wire another Starshell went up and they both froze and stillness under its glare

11
00:00:59.64 --> 00:01:02.52
Then they moved again hurrying for all they were worth

12
00:01:03.68 --> 00:01:07.56
Born felt the sense of triumph and escape thrill in him

13
00:01:08.68 --> 00:01:10.92
Anyway, the hunt couldn't see him now

14
00:01:13.28 --> 00:01:15.76
Something kicked him in the upper part of the chest

15
00:01:15.76 --> 00:01:26.04
Rending its way through him and his agonized cry was scarcely audible in the rush of blood from his mouth as he collapsed and fell

16
00:01:27.16 --> 00:01:31.24
Weeper turned his head over his shoulder listened stopped and went back

17
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:37.98
He found born trying to lift himself and born spoke gasping suffocating

18
00:01:38.48 --> 00:01:40.48
Go on, I'm scuppered

19
00:01:40.48 --> 00:01:49.64
I'll not leave the said whipper said weeper. He stood and lifted the other and his huge ungangly arms

20
00:01:50.20 --> 00:01:53.32
carrying him as tenderly as though he were a child

21
00:01:54.28 --> 00:01:59.24
Born struggled weirdly to speak and the blood filling his mouth

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Prevented him

23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.20
Sometimes his head fell on weeper's shoulder

24
00:02:05.20 --> 00:02:09.76
That last barely articulate a few words came

25
00:02:10.96 --> 00:02:15.12
I'm finished leave me in peace for God's sake. You can't

26
00:02:16.24 --> 00:02:18.24
I'll not leave thee

27
00:02:18.24 --> 00:02:20.24
said weeper in infuriate rage

28
00:02:22.24 --> 00:02:26.04
He felt born stretch himself in a convulsive shutter and

29
00:02:27.16 --> 00:02:31.08
Relax becoming suddenly heavier in his arms

30
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:38.48
He struggled on stumbling over the shell plowed ground through that fantastic mist

31
00:02:38.76 --> 00:02:42.36
Which moved like an army of rates hurling away from him?

32
00:02:43.48 --> 00:02:48.60
Then he stopped and taking the body by the waist with his left arm flung it over his shoulder

33
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Steating it with his right

34
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:56.40
He could see there wire now and presently he was challenged and replied

35
00:02:57.36 --> 00:02:59.36
He found the way through the wire

36
00:02:59.36 --> 00:03:03.36
And staggered into the trench with his burden

37
00:03:05.20 --> 00:03:07.20
Then he turned down the short stretch

38
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:16.08
to monk trench trench and came on the rest of the party outside a company's dugout

39
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.72
I've brought him back he cried desperately

40
00:03:20.72 --> 00:03:29.20
And collapsed with the body on the duckboards

41
00:03:31.20 --> 00:03:34.56
And that is from a book called

42
00:03:35.84 --> 00:03:37.84
The Middle Parts of Fortune

43
00:03:38.64 --> 00:03:42.32
Which is written by a guy named Frederick Manning

44
00:03:43.60 --> 00:03:47.60
who served with the kings

45
00:03:47.60 --> 00:03:54.32
Shropshire light infantry in World War I he served with the seventh battalion at the battle of the song

46
00:03:55.12 --> 00:04:02.88
And after the war he became a writer and the book which is actually a novel but based on his experiences

47
00:04:03.92 --> 00:04:09.36
Was published as being written by private one nine zero two two

48
00:04:10.64 --> 00:04:14.24
It's out of got originally published and then after his death

49
00:04:14.24 --> 00:04:19.60
He finally received credit for writing it and it's a

50
00:04:20.72 --> 00:04:28.32
It's a very powerful book and I wanted to start with that excerpt from World War I because it is the most shining

51
00:04:28.88 --> 00:04:33.92
In my mind and most horrific example of a Trishon warfare

52
00:04:34.40 --> 00:04:36.40
Almost 20 million killed

53
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:40.64
Usually over a few hundred yards of trench

54
00:04:40.64 --> 00:04:44.64
And I can't stand that

55
00:04:45.92 --> 00:04:53.04
A Trishon warfare is a strategy in which one side tries to grind down and wear down the other side

56
00:04:54.56 --> 00:04:58.72
And they break when they no longer have the men

57
00:05:00.88 --> 00:05:02.88
The soldiers

58
00:05:03.44 --> 00:05:07.76
The people the humans or the supplies to keep it going

59
00:05:07.76 --> 00:05:09.76
In

60
00:05:09.76 --> 00:05:11.76
It's brutal

61
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:13.76
And it also gives

62
00:05:13.76 --> 00:05:15.76
No real advantage

63
00:05:17.12 --> 00:05:23.20
To intellect and to thought and to tactical prowess on the battlefield

64
00:05:25.92 --> 00:05:27.92
And I don't like it

65
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:31.04
Now the opposite

66
00:05:31.04 --> 00:05:33.36
Of a Trishon warfare is maneuver warfare

67
00:05:34.40 --> 00:05:36.64
And that's what we're gonna dive into tonight

68
00:05:36.64 --> 00:05:40.64
The book is the maneuver warfare handbook

69
00:05:42.48 --> 00:05:44.48
But as we

70
00:05:44.48 --> 00:05:46.48
Talk about it

71
00:05:46.48 --> 00:05:50.48
Think about it not just being about war and about combat

72
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:56.80
But about how a Trishon warfare and maneuver warfare can be easily seen

73
00:05:57.84 --> 00:06:00.16
In the way that we lead you know and

74
00:06:00.16 --> 00:06:05.28
Also in the way we interact with other people with other humans which is what leading is

75
00:06:08.80 --> 00:06:10.80
And so here we go

76
00:06:10.80 --> 00:06:14.000
Into this book right here maneuver warfare handbook

77
00:06:15.52 --> 00:06:19.52
It's written by William S. Lind and we're getting him in a minute

78
00:06:22.16 --> 00:06:23.36
Here we go with the book

79
00:06:23.36 --> 00:06:26.72
I served over 31 years active duty with the Marine Corps

80
00:06:26.72 --> 00:06:33.44
Saw combat in both Korean Vietnam and attended service schools from the basic school to the National War College

81
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:40.08
Yet only toward the end of my military career did I realize how little I really understood the art of war

82
00:06:41.12 --> 00:06:47.92
Even as a PFC in Korea after being met a vact along with most of my platoon after a fruitless frontal assault

83
00:06:47.92 --> 00:06:50.32
Against superior North Korean forces

84
00:06:50.32 --> 00:06:53.84
It seemed to me there had to be a better way to wage war

85
00:06:53.84 --> 00:06:55.84
17 years later

86
00:06:56.64 --> 00:06:58.64
Commanding a battalion at K-Son

87
00:06:59.36 --> 00:07:05.04
I was resolved that none of my Marines would die for lack of superior combat power

88
00:07:06.32 --> 00:07:11.36
But we were still relying on the concentration of superior firepower to win

89
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:15.28
Essentially still practicing grants at Trishon warfare

90
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.96
And we were still doing frontal assaults

91
00:07:20.64 --> 00:07:22.64
That opening right there is

92
00:07:22.64 --> 00:07:24.64
Colonel John C. Stutt

93
00:07:26.48 --> 00:07:30.32
Marine Corps obviously and he just kind of explained his his

94
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:33.44
his career path

95
00:07:33.44 --> 00:07:40.16
Servant in both Korean Vietnam and he goes on the author of this book so he's doing the forward to this book maneuver warfare

96
00:07:40.16 --> 00:07:44.48
The author of this book has never served a day of active military duty

97
00:07:45.68 --> 00:07:47.68
And he has never been shot at

98
00:07:47.68 --> 00:07:53.76
Although there are no doubt some senior officers would like to remedy that later ladder deficiency

99
00:07:53.76 --> 00:07:58.96
So he's a little bit unpopular the guy that wrote this book with some with some people

100
00:07:59.44 --> 00:08:03.28
Yet he demonstrates an amazing understanding of the art of war

101
00:08:04.16 --> 00:08:09.12
As have only a small handful of military thinkers. I have come across in my career

102
00:08:09.52 --> 00:08:11.52
So he's talking about this guy

103
00:08:11.52 --> 00:08:14.32
William William S. Linde

104
00:08:14.32 --> 00:08:22.40
And here he goes into some details on William S. Linde and how he came into contact with him

105
00:08:23.12 --> 00:08:25.12
Back to the book

106
00:08:25.52 --> 00:08:33.12
When I first heard Bill Lynn speak I must confess I resented a mere civilian expressing criticism of the way our beloved

107
00:08:33.12 --> 00:08:34.16
Core did things

108
00:08:34.88 --> 00:08:37.12
After all he was not one of us

109
00:08:37.76 --> 00:08:41.04
He had not shed blood with us in battle. He was not a brother

110
00:08:41.04 --> 00:08:47.28
And I had strong suspicions that he would have difficulty passing the PFT

111
00:08:47.92 --> 00:08:53.84
Meaning the physical test the physical this so this guy went a lind not not exactly a

112
00:08:54.56 --> 00:08:56.56
High level athlete

113
00:08:57.20 --> 00:09:03.52
But what he said made sense for the first time I was personally hearing someone advocate a new

114
00:09:03.52 --> 00:09:09.04
Unapproach to war that was based on intellectual innovation rather than sheer material superiority

115
00:09:09.04 --> 00:09:13.36
Mission type orders surfaces and gaps shfared punked

116
00:09:14.16 --> 00:09:19.12
Instead of the rigid formulas and checklist that we normally associate with our training and doctrine

117
00:09:19.60 --> 00:09:21.60
It was a stimulating experience

118
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.32
Through Lynn's articulation years of my own reading of military history began to make a lot more sense

119
00:09:30.16 --> 00:09:33.28
But why all this from a civilian instead of a professional soldier?

120
00:09:33.28 --> 00:09:41.44
In fact the entire movement for for military reform is driven largely by civilian intellectuals not military officers

121
00:09:41.76 --> 00:09:45.60
One notable exception being retired air force Colonel John Boyd

122
00:09:46.72 --> 00:09:48.96
When you think about it, this is not surprising

123
00:09:49.60 --> 00:09:51.60
We have never institutionalized

124
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:57.68
A system that encourages innovative ideas or criticism from subordinates. So there you go

125
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.76
It's the military. What do you say to your what do you say to your superior officer?

126
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:05.60
I don't think that's a good plan. No, what they're told to do is support the plan

127
00:10:07.76 --> 00:10:15.04
Proposing significant change is viewed frequently viewed as criticism of superiors since they're responsible for the way things are

128
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:18.80
And borders on disloyalty if not in subordination

129
00:10:20.08 --> 00:10:24.96
So it's not surprising that the movement for reform comes from outside the military establishment

130
00:10:24.96 --> 00:10:29.76
And he goes on to say be age

131
00:10:30.16 --> 00:10:34.16
Lidale Hart which be age Lidale Hart was a guy that

132
00:10:35.60 --> 00:10:38.000
Fought in world war one a Brit the front world war one

133
00:10:39.36 --> 00:10:42.96
Battle of Somme he got hit three times

134
00:10:44.24 --> 00:10:45.68
Eventually was gasped

135
00:10:46.32 --> 00:10:50.72
Set out of line and almost his entire battalion was wiped out

136
00:10:50.72 --> 00:10:57.28
And this guy eventually wrote a book called strategy and indirect approach

137
00:10:59.52 --> 00:11:02.24
And an interesting I pulled up one quote from him

138
00:11:03.84 --> 00:11:07.84
Often the longest way around is the shortest way there

139
00:11:08.40 --> 00:11:10.40
This is the indirect approach

140
00:11:10.80 --> 00:11:14.24
So anyways back to the book here on what be age Lidale Hart said

141
00:11:14.24 --> 00:11:22.72
Bill Hart once remarked that the only thing harder than getting a new idea into the military mind is to get an old one out

142
00:11:23.68 --> 00:11:27.20
In 1925 when he was expounding such a terrible

143
00:11:28.08 --> 00:11:30.40
theories as the indirect approach

144
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:38.80
The American General Service Schools review of current military literature dismissed one of Lidale Hart's major works as

145
00:11:38.80 --> 00:11:43.36
Negative value to the instructors at these schools

146
00:11:44.72 --> 00:11:49.20
I expect Marine Corps schools to receive this publication with similar enthusiasm

147
00:11:49.68 --> 00:11:53.68
But I cannot believe a professional military officer would not benefit by reading it

148
00:11:56.80 --> 00:11:58.32
So

149
00:11:58.32 --> 00:12:00.32
That's if you

150
00:12:00.32 --> 00:12:06.80
To catch the set up of this book he's saying look this is different what we've been taught this is different and by the way this this book

151
00:12:06.80 --> 00:12:10.000
I'm checking the dates right now this came out in 1985

152
00:12:10.80 --> 00:12:11.84
So

153
00:12:11.84 --> 00:12:16.64
There has been progress in this direction since then but at the time that this came out it was just

154
00:12:17.84 --> 00:12:20.56
It was viewed as almost

155
00:12:21.04 --> 00:12:23.04
In subordination to think this way

156
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:28.16
So let's jump into it right here

157
00:12:28.16 --> 00:12:41.68
With the theory of maneuver warfare so now we're getting to lend himself writing maneuver warfare is not new

158
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:48.40
It probably dates from the first time a caveman surprised an enemy from behind instead of meeting him club to club

159
00:12:50.72 --> 00:12:55.04
Sometimes the word maneuver is used as a synonym for movement

160
00:12:55.04 --> 00:13:00.64
Such such as in references to fire and maneuver in small unit tactics

161
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:06.56
So that's you know we have in in the book extreme ownership cover move and and that's what we're talking about

162
00:13:06.56 --> 00:13:11.28
We're talking about move. He's saying fire maneuver is the same use of the word maneuver to mean move

163
00:13:14.16 --> 00:13:19.68
Manuver is organized movement of troops during combat operations to a new access and

164
00:13:19.68 --> 00:13:27.20
Region for the purpose of taking in an advantageous position relative to the enemy in order to deliver a decisive strike

165
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:30.80
So that that's sort of the classical definition

166
00:13:31.68 --> 00:13:34.40
But when used in the phrase maneuver warfare

167
00:13:35.12 --> 00:13:37.12
maneuver means much more

168
00:13:37.92 --> 00:13:43.84
Only recently has someone suggested a convincing answer of what maneuver means

169
00:13:43.84 --> 00:13:48.72
That man is a retired air force colonel and fighter pilot named John Boyd

170
00:13:49.44 --> 00:13:54.24
Colonel Boyd's development of the theory of maneuver warfare began not with ground battles

171
00:13:54.96 --> 00:13:59.04
But with a study of some mock air to air combat exercises

172
00:13:59.60 --> 00:14:05.92
Conducted at Nella's air force base in 1974 that led him back to the study of air to air combat during the Korean war

173
00:14:06.88 --> 00:14:12.96
American aviators were very successful in that conflict they achieved a 10 to one kill ratio

174
00:14:12.96 --> 00:14:21.44
Over their North Korean and Chinese opponents Colonel Boyd began his study with the question how and why did we do so well?

175
00:14:23.28 --> 00:14:29.36
He noted in several tradition he noted that in several traditional measures of aircraft performance

176
00:14:29.92 --> 00:14:35.76
The principal communist fighter the Meg 15 was superior to the American F86

177
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.60
So you might think oh Americans always have the best technology not true

178
00:14:39.60 --> 00:14:43.92
So and and Boyd will end up doing boyd we're gonna hear quite a bit about him right now

179
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.44
But this guy was sort of a strategic genius in the air force and a bunch of people on Twitter

180
00:14:49.84 --> 00:14:53.12
Hit me and social media have always been saying you got to do boy. You got to do boy

181
00:14:53.12 --> 00:14:56.96
And I know I got to do boy to some point and this is sort of a good introduction to boyd

182
00:14:57.52 --> 00:14:58.80
So

183
00:14:58.80 --> 00:15:04.56
Here's the here's the difference between the Meg 15 and the American F86

184
00:15:04.56 --> 00:15:10.08
The Meg 15 it could climb and accelerate faster and it had better sustain turn rate

185
00:15:10.72 --> 00:15:17.04
But in two less obvious measures of aircraft performance the F86 was much superior to the Meg

186
00:15:17.60 --> 00:15:25.92
First the pilot could see out much better the F86 bubble canopy gave its pilot very good outward vision

187
00:15:26.48 --> 00:15:30.40
While the Meg's faired faired canopy made it difficult to see out

188
00:15:30.40 --> 00:15:38.40
Second the F86 had a high powered and highly effective hydraulic controls and the Meg did not

189
00:15:39.04 --> 00:15:43.68
This meant that while the Meg could do many individual actions

190
00:15:44.24 --> 00:15:54.48
Including turn climb and accelerate better than the F86 the F86 could transition from one action to another much more quickly than the Meg

191
00:15:55.76 --> 00:15:57.76
It was better in the transition

192
00:15:57.76 --> 00:16:04.24
So for all you did it super players we start that scramble you start that scramble the the F86 is a better scramble

193
00:16:06.24 --> 00:16:14.24
Using these two superior to use the American pilots developed a tactical approach that forced the Meg into a series of actions each

194
00:16:15.04 --> 00:16:24.32
Each time the action changed the F86 gained a time advantage because the F86 pilot could see more quickly how the situation had changed

195
00:16:24.32 --> 00:16:29.04
And he could also make his aircraft shift more quickly to a new action

196
00:16:29.52 --> 00:16:36.000
So he can see what's happening faster than once he sees it which he saw faster now he can make his adjustment faster

197
00:16:37.04 --> 00:16:40.88
With each change the Meg's actions became more

198
00:16:41.60 --> 00:16:47.44
inappropriate until they were so inappropriate that the Meg gave the F86 a good firing opportunity

199
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.68
Often it appeared the Meg pilot realized what was happening to him in panic

200
00:16:51.68 --> 00:16:54.80
Which made the American pilots job all the easier

201
00:16:56.96 --> 00:17:02.000
Later Colonel Boyd began studying ground combat to see if there were any situation similar to that

202
00:17:02.40 --> 00:17:04.88
He had found in the air war over Korea

203
00:17:05.20 --> 00:17:10.64
He found that in battles campaigns in wars like Vixberg and France a

204
00:17:11.28 --> 00:17:13.28
Similar thing seemed to have happened

205
00:17:13.28 --> 00:17:23.28
One side had presented the other with a sudden unexpected change or a series of such changes to which it could not adjust in a timely manner as a result

206
00:17:23.28 --> 00:17:28.000
It was defeated and it was generally defeated at small costs as a divector

207
00:17:28.96 --> 00:17:36.40
Often the losing side had been physically stronger than the winner just like the Meg 15 was was physically faster

208
00:17:37.60 --> 00:17:39.60
It didn't matter

209
00:17:39.60 --> 00:17:48.72
And often the same sort of panic and paralysis the North Korean and Chinese pilots had shown seemed to occur

210
00:17:49.60 --> 00:17:53.60
Colonel Boyd asked himself what did all these cases have in common?

211
00:17:54.24 --> 00:17:58.000
His answer was what is now called the Boyd theory

212
00:17:58.64 --> 00:18:01.04
Which is the theory of maneuver warfare

213
00:18:02.16 --> 00:18:08.16
The briefing Colonel Boyd gives to explain his theory patterns of conflict takes over five hours

214
00:18:08.16 --> 00:18:14.72
So he's so the so Colonel Boyd does give this brief and it takes over five hours or he did when he was when he was alive

215
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:21.12
But at the cost of missing some of the subtleties and supporting historical evidence in the briefing it can be summarized as follows

216
00:18:21.12 --> 00:18:25.12
So here's a kind of a synopsis of the Boyd theory that

217
00:18:26.08 --> 00:18:28.08
Lin is gonna put together for us right now

218
00:18:29.36 --> 00:18:31.36
Back to the book

219
00:18:31.36 --> 00:18:38.96
Conflict can be seen as time competitive observation orientation decision action cycles

220
00:18:39.92 --> 00:18:43.12
Each party to a conflict begins by observing

221
00:18:43.36 --> 00:18:46.64
He observes himself his physical surroundings and his enemy

222
00:18:47.04 --> 00:18:54.64
On the basis of his observatory observation he oryons that is to say he makes a mental image or snapshot of his situation

223
00:18:55.20 --> 00:18:58.40
On the basis of this orientation he makes a decision

224
00:18:58.40 --> 00:19:02.08
He puts the decision into effect i.e. he acts

225
00:19:02.88 --> 00:19:06.64
Then because he assumes his action has changed the situation

226
00:19:06.88 --> 00:19:11.92
He observes again and starts the process a new his actions follow a cycle

227
00:19:12.40 --> 00:19:20.56
Sometimes called the Boyd cycle or Ud aloup and Ud is O O DA and that's observed oriented side and act

228
00:19:20.56 --> 00:19:30.48
If one side in a conflict can consistently go through the Boyd cycle faster than the other it gains a tremendous event advantage

229
00:19:31.04 --> 00:19:39.68
By the time the slower side acts the faster side is doing something different from what he observed and his action is inappropriate

230
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.52
With each cycle the slower parties action is inappropriately

231
00:19:44.48 --> 00:19:46.88
Is inappropriate by a larger time margin

232
00:19:46.88 --> 00:19:52.96
Even though he desperately strives to do something that will work each action is less useful than its predecessor

233
00:19:52.96 --> 00:19:55.20
He falls further and further behind

234
00:19:55.92 --> 00:19:57.92
Ultimately he ceases to be effective

235
00:19:59.04 --> 00:20:04.08
And he we clearly I mean that this is obvious in combat. It's also obvious in in jujitsu

236
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:07.12
I mean very clear when you're training when you're wrong with somebody

237
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:15.84
If if they're not making adjustments fast enough you just it's two or three two or three transitions and you got them you're on their back. You know

238
00:20:18.80 --> 00:20:24.64
The Boyd Fury defines what is meant by the word maneuver in the term maneuver warfare

239
00:20:25.04 --> 00:20:26.80
Manuver means Boyd cycling

240
00:20:27.28 --> 00:20:35.20
Boyd cycling the enemy being consistently faster through however many Ud aloups it takes until the enemy loses its cohesion until he can no longer fight

241
00:20:35.20 --> 00:20:37.20
Isn't effective organized force

242
00:20:38.08 --> 00:20:41.52
Sometimes a Boyd cycle the enemy panics or becomes passive

243
00:20:41.92 --> 00:20:50.88
This is an ideal outcome for the victor because a panicked passive enemy can be annihilated or captured at the lowest cost in friendly casualties

244
00:20:51.60 --> 00:20:56.80
At other times the outmaneuvered enemy may continue to fight as individuals or small units

245
00:20:56.80 --> 00:21:06.56
But because he can no longer act effectively as a force he is comparatively easy to destroy so

246
00:21:07.60 --> 00:21:13.52
Continuing on if the object in maneuver warfare is to move through the Ud aloups faster than the enemy

247
00:21:13.92 --> 00:21:15.28
What do you need to do?

248
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:17.68
How can you be consistently faster?

249
00:21:18.56 --> 00:21:22.96
Much of the much of the rest of this book is an effort to address that question

250
00:21:22.96 --> 00:21:28.000
But in terms of general theory the following points are worth thinking about

251
00:21:28.72 --> 00:21:29.92
one

252
00:21:29.92 --> 00:21:33.92
Only a decentralized military can have a fast-oot aloup

253
00:21:35.28 --> 00:21:43.28
If the observations must be passed up the chain of command the orientation made in the decision taken at a high level and the command for action

254
00:21:43.28 --> 00:21:47.84
Then transmitted back down the chain the Ud aloup is going to be slow

255
00:21:47.84 --> 00:21:57.52
As the Israeli military historian Martin van Crevel has observed from Plato to NATO

256
00:21:58.08 --> 00:22:02.96
The history of command and war consists of an endless quest for certainty

257
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:10.96
Certainty concerning the state and intention of the enemy's forces certain de-concerning the manifold factors

258
00:22:10.96 --> 00:22:18.56
Which together constitute the environment from the weather and the terrain to the radioactivity and presence of chemical warfare agents and

259
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:21.20
Last but definitely not least

260
00:22:21.20 --> 00:22:25.20
Certainty concerning the state and activities of one's own forces

261
00:22:25.92 --> 00:22:32.32
Historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty

262
00:22:33.28 --> 00:22:38.16
One was to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man

263
00:22:38.16 --> 00:22:41.84
Allowed to do only that which could be controlled

264
00:22:43.04 --> 00:22:55.76
That's centralized command the other to design organizations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control

265
00:22:56.64 --> 00:23:01.04
This second the second of these methods has that's decentralized command

266
00:23:01.44 --> 00:23:06.88
The second of these methods has to buy and large proved more successful than the first and

267
00:23:06.88 --> 00:23:17.76
The ongoing revolution in the technology of command notwithstanding this is likely to remain so in the future and indeed so long as war itself exists

268
00:23:20.72 --> 00:23:24.48
Very obvious stuff and again, you know in in our book

269
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:33.44
Stream ownership. That's one of the principles of combat decentralized command and this is what it is if you don't have decentralized command

270
00:23:33.44 --> 00:23:39.76
That you have to report up the chain of command that takes time by the time it gets back down

271
00:23:40.08 --> 00:23:44.16
What the decision decision gets made at the higher level than they pass it back down to you

272
00:23:45.76 --> 00:23:51.28
By the time it gets to you it's already changed and that's in a jiu-jitsu in a jitsu

273
00:23:52.40 --> 00:23:59.52
comparison if you if you if you have to think about your moves, so you have instinct to lose muscle memory when somebody

274
00:23:59.52 --> 00:24:04.80
Starts the pass your guard you get the underlock if you have to think about getting the underhook

275
00:24:04.80 --> 00:24:11.44
And you have to command your body to get the underhook there. You got the underhook on you. Yeah, so it's the same thing here. That's the dead's decentralized command

276
00:24:13.52 --> 00:24:20.16
Back to the book number two maneuver warfare means you will not only accept confusion and disorder and

277
00:24:20.48 --> 00:24:24.80
Operate successfully within it through decentralization you will also

278
00:24:24.80 --> 00:24:32.40
Generate confusion and disorder. I love that that's just awesome right? It's not just saying hey look things great confusing

279
00:24:32.88 --> 00:24:37.44
But I'm actually going to create the confusion. I'm going to make it happen that's something any

280
00:24:37.44 --> 00:24:40.96
When you see the really good jiu-jitsu guys, I mean Glover does that Glover creates confusion

281
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:47.04
He creates mayhem he creates chaos and the gate in the in a match. He wants the scrambled to happen. He wants to go as long as possible

282
00:24:47.04 --> 00:24:56.64
The reconnaissance pull tactics of the German blitzkrieg were inherently disorderly now this is something that's very

283
00:24:56.80 --> 00:25:00.56
Contrary to what people think of of the German military and even the German culture

284
00:25:01.44 --> 00:25:07.12
German culture is very orderly and here we say the the blitzkrieg was inherently disorderly

285
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.04
Back to the book higher headquarters could neither direct nor predict the exact path of the advance

286
00:25:13.04 --> 00:25:20.000
But the multitude of German reconnaissance thrust generated massive confusion among the French in 1940

287
00:25:20.48 --> 00:25:30.64
Each was reported as a new attack the German seemed to be everywhere and the French who system demanded certainty before making any decisions were paralyzed

288
00:25:32.64 --> 00:25:36.08
It's it's very interesting to think about that idea of

289
00:25:36.08 --> 00:25:47.52
We all want to have certainty and what's going to happen and how in in battle and in life if you wait until you're 100% certain you're probably going to be too late

290
00:25:51.20 --> 00:25:57.60
Speaking of certainty three all patterns recipes and formulas are to be avoided

291
00:25:58.32 --> 00:26:04.16
The enemy must not be able to predict your actions if your tactics follow predictable patterns

292
00:26:04.16 --> 00:26:11.04
The enemy can easily cut inside your utaloupe if you can predict what you will do you will be waiting for you

293
00:26:12.32 --> 00:26:16.80
This is why it's so hard to tell someone how to do maneuver warfare

294
00:26:17.84 --> 00:26:21.28
There is no formula you can learn when someone says

295
00:26:22.40 --> 00:26:26.24
Cut all the bull about theory just tell me what to do you can't

296
00:26:27.76 --> 00:26:31.36
You can talk about how to think and about some useful techniques

297
00:26:31.36 --> 00:26:36.24
But you can't give new formulas to replace the ones currently taught

298
00:26:37.28 --> 00:26:39.44
Instead of a checklist or a cookbook

299
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:44.24
maneuver warfare requires commanders who can sense more than they can see

300
00:26:44.96 --> 00:26:52.40
Who understand the opponent's strengths and weaknesses and their own and who can find the enemies critical weaknesses in a specific situation

301
00:26:53.20 --> 00:26:58.80
They must be able to create multiple threats and keep the enemy uncertain as to which one is real

302
00:26:58.80 --> 00:27:03.36
They must be able to see their options in the situation before them

303
00:27:04.24 --> 00:27:10.40
Constantly create new options and shift rapidly among options as the situation develops

304
00:27:12.16 --> 00:27:17.52
General Herman bulk one of the most successful practitioners of maneuver warfare said

305
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.12
I'm against the school approach that says in accordance with the ideas of the general staff in this situation

306
00:27:23.12 --> 00:27:25.12
You must do thus and such

307
00:27:25.12 --> 00:27:34.80
On the contrary you must proceed as dictated by the personalities involved and the particulars of the situation

308
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:41.84
So he got a German successful German general and he's actually saying you react based

309
00:27:42.40 --> 00:27:47.04
Not just on the situation of the of the on the ground but on the personalities involved

310
00:27:47.04 --> 00:27:51.68
Leadership is an art my friend

311
00:27:56.24 --> 00:28:01.76
Therefore one of the first principles has to be there can be no fixed schemes

312
00:28:02.48 --> 00:28:05.20
Every scheme every pattern is wrong

313
00:28:06.16 --> 00:28:12.16
No two situations are identical that is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous

314
00:28:12.16 --> 00:28:18.56
Another principle that follows from is from this is never do the same thing twice

315
00:28:19.12 --> 00:28:23.28
Even if something works well for you once by the second time the enemy will have adapted

316
00:28:23.92 --> 00:28:25.92
So you have to think of something new

317
00:28:27.28 --> 00:28:32.16
No one thinks of becoming a great painter simply by imitating Michelangelo

318
00:28:33.20 --> 00:28:38.72
Similarly you can't become a great military leader just by imitating someone

319
00:28:38.72 --> 00:28:45.04
It has to come from within in the last analysis military command is an art

320
00:28:46.32 --> 00:28:49.44
One man can do it and most will never learn

321
00:28:53.28 --> 00:28:55.28
Little bit of maneuver warfare and

322
00:28:57.52 --> 00:29:05.28
So so at the the way the book is broken up this book is called maneuver warfare handbook it's it goes into

323
00:29:05.28 --> 00:29:07.28
to

324
00:29:07.76 --> 00:29:09.76
breaks into another

325
00:29:09.76 --> 00:29:11.76
section which we're gonna get to in a minute

326
00:29:12.48 --> 00:29:18.64
But he kind of goes into a little bit will end go now goes into a little bit talking about education and training

327
00:29:20.96 --> 00:29:26.08
Back to the book it is my great and this is a quote it is my great and constant hope

328
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:34.40
That the Marine Coral will produce some outstanding man for this country such man are somewhere and they may as well be in our classes

329
00:29:34.40 --> 00:29:41.12
Is anywhere else? I do not want such a person to be hammered down by narrowness and dogmas

330
00:29:42.40 --> 00:29:46.16
to have his mind cramped by compulsory details

331
00:29:46.88 --> 00:29:52.24
It is my constant ambition to see the Marine officers filled with ambition

332
00:29:52.96 --> 00:29:59.52
Initiative and originality and they can get these attributes only by liberal

333
00:29:59.52 --> 00:30:10.24
Liberality of thought broad thought that differs thought that differs from precedent and the compulsory imprint of others

334
00:30:11.84 --> 00:30:13.84
And that is a long paragraph

335
00:30:14.40 --> 00:30:16.40
That says free your mind

336
00:30:17.76 --> 00:30:21.84
Free your mind and I love pointing us out because this is the Marine Corps

337
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:27.92
That's that that quote is from the common dawn of Marine Corps schools Brigadier general

338
00:30:27.92 --> 00:30:32.000
J.C. Breckenridge written in 1934 in

339
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:37.20
1934 he was saying people Marine Corps officers

340
00:30:38.08 --> 00:30:40.08
Don't go by the book

341
00:30:40.32 --> 00:30:44.32
Don't obey what other people said he wants him filled with ambition. That's pretty normal

342
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:46.64
But initiative and originality

343
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.80
He's telling in order to be a good leader

344
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:54.48
You got to free your mind

345
00:30:54.48 --> 00:30:59.92
Now like I said the book makes a transition from being the

346
00:31:02.08 --> 00:31:04.72
From being the introduction

347
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:11.20
by William Lind about maneuver warfare and then it slides into another section

348
00:31:11.92 --> 00:31:18.80
Which is just about as big and this this part is called fundamentals of tactics and this section is

349
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:25.76
Written by Colonel Michael D. Wiley United says Marine Corps and he ran a course

350
00:31:26.96 --> 00:31:30.000
Fundamentals of tactics course and this is

351
00:31:30.80 --> 00:31:36.72
Sort of the this is the this is the notes from the course when he would teach this course the fundamentals of tactics and a Colonel Wiley

352
00:31:36.96 --> 00:31:38.96
Kind of interesting he went to the

353
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:43.68
Went to the using elisted marine then he went to the naval academy and he was

354
00:31:44.32 --> 00:31:46.32
Jim webs

355
00:31:46.32 --> 00:31:51.76
Company commander in Vietnam Vietnam and and Jim web is a fairly

356
00:31:52.48 --> 00:31:59.12
Famous guy he was a navy cross winner. He is a set now a he was a senator from Virginia

357
00:32:00.80 --> 00:32:02.80
He wrote a book called

358
00:32:03.12 --> 00:32:07.36
Fields of fire and then there's another great book called

359
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:12.08
The Night and Gale song which is he follows a couple

360
00:32:12.96 --> 00:32:14.96
five

361
00:32:14.96 --> 00:32:19.68
So yeah, I think it's it's a web McCain all over north

362
00:32:22.24 --> 00:32:26.48
Macphorland I think and and John point actually anyways very prominent

363
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:33.68
Graduates from the naval academy that all kind of stood out and were were connected

364
00:32:33.92 --> 00:32:42.80
Throughout the book so this guy so Jim web is this is this kind of famous guy and this guy that wrote this was was Jim web's company commander in Vietnam

365
00:32:42.80 --> 00:32:44.80
So that's

366
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:49.12
Kind of it's a small world things tie together

367
00:32:49.68 --> 00:32:54.80
So now we get into these lectures that you wrote and I don't mean the lecture anybody but

368
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.84
Hey, they're called lectures in this book. I would just call them free-frow information

369
00:32:59.84 --> 00:33:05.12
We're gonna learn from in the first the first section is called surfaces and gaps

370
00:33:05.12 --> 00:33:13.20
The concept of surfaces and gaps is one of several concepts that bear on tactics

371
00:33:13.84 --> 00:33:21.68
It is unimportant whether you refer to this concept as surfaces and gaps or soft spot tactics or simply the idea of

372
00:33:21.84 --> 00:33:24.72
Pitting your strength against the enemies weaknesses

373
00:33:26.32 --> 00:33:31.68
That is what it is all about strength against weakness call it what you will the term

374
00:33:31.68 --> 00:33:38.16
Surfaces and gaps is derived from a German term flaking on the lukin tactic

375
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:46.000
Which means simply the tactics of surfaces and gaps the surfaces being the enemy strong points

376
00:33:46.24 --> 00:33:50.32
Which we avoid the gaps being the weak points that we want to go through

377
00:33:52.16 --> 00:33:54.56
Now La Delle Hart if we talked about already today

378
00:33:54.56 --> 00:34:06.24
Called it the expanding torrent system tactic he drew an analogy between attacking an attacking army and a torrent of water

379
00:34:07.28 --> 00:34:12.48
If we watch a torrent bearing down on each successive bank of earth and damn in its path

380
00:34:12.48 --> 00:34:17.44
We see that it first beats against the obstacle feeling and testing it on all points

381
00:34:18.16 --> 00:34:20.48
Eventually it falls it finds a small crack

382
00:34:20.48 --> 00:34:29.92
Through this crack pour the first driplets of water and rush straight on the pent-up water on each side is drawn towards the breach

383
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:36.96
It swirls through around the flanks of the breach wearing away the earth on each side and so widening the gap

384
00:34:37.36 --> 00:34:44.24
Simultaneously the water behind poor straight through that breach between this the side eti's which are wearing away the flanks

385
00:34:44.72 --> 00:34:48.40
Directly it is passed through it expands to widen once more

386
00:34:48.40 --> 00:34:51.68
The on-reach of the turn of the torrent

387
00:34:52.56 --> 00:34:59.92
Thus as the water pours through it in and an ever increasing volume the on-reach of the torrent swells to its original proportion

388
00:35:00.40 --> 00:35:03.28
Leaving in turn each crumbling obstacle behind it

389
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:07.92
Long paragraph

390
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:12.96
But that's how water gets through things finds the weak point and piles on

391
00:35:12.96 --> 00:35:21.52
The idea of putting surfaces and gaps tactics into practice was first implemented by the German army in world war one

392
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:28.16
This is stuff that everybody should know especially military people in 1918 as they prepared for

393
00:35:28.16 --> 00:35:32.64
Ludendorf spring offensive the German army changed its offensive tactics

394
00:35:33.12 --> 00:35:38.80
The Germans had found that they were being overpowered by the material available to the British and the French

395
00:35:38.80 --> 00:35:44.56
The Americans were coming and it was clear that Germany was going to lose if she did not do something differently

396
00:35:45.12 --> 00:35:52.88
Because they did not have the option of matching the allies strength and material the Germans decided that they would have to outthink them

397
00:35:53.68 --> 00:35:56.48
That is they would have to have better tactics

398
00:35:57.76 --> 00:36:02.96
Germany did not succeed in winning the war it was too late by this time they were surrounded

399
00:36:03.36 --> 00:36:07.76
The women and children were starving at home. It was simply too late for them to win

400
00:36:07.76 --> 00:36:10.64
Yet they made some tactical progress

401
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:15.68
There at the last at last in the spring of 1918

402
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.12
They inflicted terrible defeats on their enemies to the point that the allied armies were seriously

403
00:36:21.12 --> 00:36:23.12
Considering the prospect of giving up

404
00:36:24.08 --> 00:36:27.92
At the tactical level the Germans put their strength against weakness

405
00:36:28.56 --> 00:36:30.56
They sought the gaps

406
00:36:30.56 --> 00:36:36.32
Small assault groups called storm groupin sought gaps in the enemy lines and attacked through them

407
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:41.12
Assaulting with light machine guns rifles grenades and flame throwers while heavy machine guns

408
00:36:41.36 --> 00:36:46.40
Direct and indirect weapons including trench mortars were used to suppress enemy strong points

409
00:36:47.76 --> 00:36:53.20
But on a strategic level the spring of 1918 offensive failed

410
00:36:53.84 --> 00:36:59.52
Why because looting duff on that level put strength against strength?

411
00:36:59.52 --> 00:37:07.12
He was seeking gaps he was seeking gaps at the enemy strong points. That's a very

412
00:37:07.68 --> 00:37:12.32
Great information to have so yeah the guys on the ground were attacking the weak points

413
00:37:12.32 --> 00:37:16.88
But the strategic picture they were still attacking a strong area

414
00:37:17.28 --> 00:37:21.20
So you might have found a little weakness in a wall a little weakness in the wire a little weakness in the trench

415
00:37:21.36 --> 00:37:26.48
But they were attacking a let's say at 20 mile trench that was overall was a strong area

416
00:37:26.48 --> 00:37:29.84
Whereas they should have looked for where the flanks are a hundred miles away

417
00:37:32.72 --> 00:37:39.20
Back to the book the idea of putting strength against weakness was of course born way before 1918

418
00:37:39.76 --> 00:37:45.68
Clouse fits rights about it in chapter nine and ten of book seven in chapter nine

419
00:37:45.92 --> 00:37:48.40
Regarding defense of positions he states

420
00:37:48.88 --> 00:37:55.28
The attack cannot prevail against them it has no means at its disposal to counteract their advantage

421
00:37:55.28 --> 00:38:03.28
In practice not all defensive positions are like this if the attacker sees that he can get away without assaulting them

422
00:38:03.36 --> 00:38:07.92
It would be stupid of him not to attempt it. It would be super to him to attempt it

423
00:38:08.24 --> 00:38:12.40
It is a risky business to attack an able opponent in a good position

424
00:38:13.12 --> 00:38:18.96
Same thing we heard from Sunsu you don't attack never heavily defended positions

425
00:38:18.96 --> 00:38:28.72
Back to the book employment of this concept of surfaces and gaps then gives us many advantages over what could be called

426
00:38:28.80 --> 00:38:32.80
slower moving forms of combat where strength is thrown against strength

427
00:38:33.68 --> 00:38:38.64
Attacking through gaps avoiding surfaces gives us an advantage of economy of force

428
00:38:39.52 --> 00:38:43.20
If we are pitted strength against strength assaulting enemy strong points

429
00:38:43.36 --> 00:38:47.92
We are consuming our manpower as well as ammunition to supplies as we go along

430
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:49.92
If we go through the gaps

431
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:52.40
We are practicing economy of force

432
00:38:52.80 --> 00:38:55.76
We are reaching our objective without using up our men

433
00:38:55.92 --> 00:39:02.16
We are leaving the enemy behind because we are moving faster we have the advantage of rapid exploitation

434
00:39:03.20 --> 00:39:05.44
So when you attack obviously attack weaknesses

435
00:39:06.24 --> 00:39:08.24
You lose less be lose less men

436
00:39:08.24 --> 00:39:17.84
Now this is important the concept of surfaces and gaps demands leadership from the front as opposed to leadership from the rear

437
00:39:18.56 --> 00:39:21.44
The commander must be where he can make swift decisions

438
00:39:21.84 --> 00:39:24.24
He must be where the situation is developing

439
00:39:24.96 --> 00:39:30.000
Obviously leadership from the front had become a scarcity in world war one

440
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:33.44
JFC follower in his book general ship wrote

441
00:39:33.44 --> 00:39:39.04
In the world war nothing was more dreadful to witness than a chain of men

442
00:39:39.52 --> 00:39:49.36
Starting with a batying commander and ending with an army commander sitting in telephone boxes improvised or actual talking talking

443
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
In place of leading leading

444
00:39:52.48 --> 00:39:53.52
leading

445
00:39:53.52 --> 00:39:58.24
The result was unresponsive leadership and slow reactions

446
00:39:58.24 --> 00:40:06.48
We talked about this on the last podcast when life was talking about being in an assault force and being in the assault train

447
00:40:06.64 --> 00:40:13.92
Which is 20 guys 15 or 20 guys and he was standing always at the end of the train because that's where you was told he was supposed to be

448
00:40:14.32 --> 00:40:20.24
And he didn't know what's going on the front so he couldn't help he couldn't make any decisions if someone was gonna if he needed to make a decision

449
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:23.12
Well, he couldn't even make a decision because he knows what's going on up there

450
00:40:23.12 --> 00:40:30.40
But if someone said hey, we need a decision from the boss they had to pass that word all the way back. No, not good

451
00:40:31.92 --> 00:40:35.20
So you got to lead from the front with decentralized command and

452
00:40:36.40 --> 00:40:40.88
Be far enough the final one. I don't want to make it sound that simple you got to be it's the same thing we talked about life

453
00:40:40.88 --> 00:40:43.12
You got to be far enough forward that you can

454
00:40:44.24 --> 00:40:45.92
Understand what's happening up there and

455
00:40:45.92 --> 00:40:54.20
And obviously, but you don't want to be the guy that's doing the shooting because then you've gone too far far forward to actually be detached and make decisions

456
00:40:56.08 --> 00:41:00.96
Certainly combat is not going to be that simple the gap then might be any

457
00:41:01.28 --> 00:41:06.76
Undefended point or any weekly defended point it may be any enemy vulnerability

458
00:41:07.12 --> 00:41:09.12
It might be the enemies flanks

459
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:15.92
The term flank itself needs some elaboration think of it as a relative thing

460
00:41:16.24 --> 00:41:20.08
John Boyd defines a flank as that aspect that aspect

461
00:41:20.64 --> 00:41:24.08
Toward which a force is not devoting its primary attention

462
00:41:24.72 --> 00:41:31.44
In other words in fluid warfare what is one moment the enemy's flank might the next moment be the enemy's front?

463
00:41:31.68 --> 00:41:34.20
It depends on how he is directing his attention a

464
00:41:34.20 --> 00:41:40.04
Gap for the infantry could be an enemy missile site manned by troops who are not combat oriented

465
00:41:40.36 --> 00:41:49.04
The missile site might be a surface if you are flying on an airplane, but a gap if you were a light infantryman who has gotten inside enemy lines

466
00:41:52.12 --> 00:41:53.64
So

467
00:41:53.64 --> 00:41:57.60
It does that make sense to you so if you've got a if you've got a surface to air missile

468
00:41:57.60 --> 00:42:07.52
Launcher and it it has a radio or radar on it and it can track aircraft coming in and if you're a fighter aircraft

469
00:42:07.52 --> 00:42:10.80
You don't want to say what you want to stay away from that thing because it'll get you locked on radar

470
00:42:10.80 --> 00:42:12.80
It's gonna fire a heat-seeking missile at you and kill you

471
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.84
So for them it's a surface it's a strong point for an aircraft it's a strong point

472
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
But for a ground troop

473
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.88
They don't put you know the highest level of troops

474
00:42:22.88 --> 00:42:28.48
Guarding these things because they're in the rear a little bit they put like kind of you know some what they call him here

475
00:42:30.96 --> 00:42:36.000
They're manned by troops who are not combat oriented so that means it's a softer target

476
00:42:38.80 --> 00:42:42.80
Back to the book. Let us say we are unsuccessful in finding any gaps

477
00:42:44.48 --> 00:42:48.48
We may have to create gaps and there are ways of doing this

478
00:42:48.48 --> 00:42:54.96
So then they talk about the ways you can do it you can do it through fire power of a drop in bombs by suppression by assault

479
00:42:56.32 --> 00:43:02.72
All those different ways to create gaps with you know using direct fire to soften up targets

480
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:11.60
And then then I like these tactics a little bit better another way of creating gaps is through supporting attacks by attacking one point along the line

481
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:21.84
We may divert the enemy from another point and by drawing them off created gap again this is in linear terms for instructional purposes for simplicity

482
00:43:22.32 --> 00:43:24.32
But do not get a linear mindset

483
00:43:25.28 --> 00:43:32.16
Sometimes a less costly way of creating a gap is through deception by causing the enemy to think that we will attack at one point

484
00:43:32.16 --> 00:43:35.36
There by enticing him to draw his forces off from another point

485
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:40.16
And when he attack that point where he has weakened himself

486
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:44.96
But what do we do about surfaces that is strong points?

487
00:43:45.36 --> 00:43:47.36
Sometimes they are best bypassed

488
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:54.56
Once the enemy has been bypassed as strong point maybe cut off from its support and in that way his strong point eventually withers

489
00:43:54.88 --> 00:43:58.24
Away and becomes a weak point which we can attack later

490
00:43:58.24 --> 00:44:10.48
You know we talk a lot here about not attacking people's defensible positions and this is just a classic another way of saying that

491
00:44:10.48 --> 00:44:15.60
You know we talk about people with got the ego the big ego and how you don't want to confront that ego

492
00:44:15.60 --> 00:44:20.08
Well if you can bypass the ego eventually the ego doesn't become a factor anymore

493
00:44:20.72 --> 00:44:23.36
And that's the same thing when you're doing ground combat

494
00:44:23.36 --> 00:44:33.04
Back to the book you're certain problems presented by the concept of surfaces and gaps especially to commanders who are used to slow moving forms of combat

495
00:44:33.84 --> 00:44:37.68
One is that the commander will not always know where all his people are

496
00:44:38.64 --> 00:44:44.32
In the Marine Corps we have become used to being accountable at all times for knowing exactly where every man is

497
00:44:45.52 --> 00:44:49.84
In this faster moving form of combat to do so would be impossible

498
00:44:49.84 --> 00:44:56.000
Your subordinates are finding the gaps and exploiting them so you've got you if you're control freak

499
00:44:57.36 --> 00:44:59.36
You're not gonna be able to pull this off

500
00:44:59.60 --> 00:45:05.60
Because I'm saying where are you echo where are you echo where are you? No echo is out there. He's working. He's finding some gaps to get through

501
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:08.16
Not no exactly where he is

502
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:11.60
Another problem is that artillery in air might not be

503
00:45:11.60 --> 00:45:19.44
May not be controlled as closely as is possible in slowing slower moving forms of combat so you start to

504
00:45:19.84 --> 00:45:26.000
Deal with the problems of of air support and artillery is a little trickier to use because you have people moving

505
00:45:26.96 --> 00:45:30.32
Around the battlefield and you're not sure where everyone is and that makes it very difficult

506
00:45:30.32 --> 00:45:32.32
Because you obviously don't want to drop bombs on your own people

507
00:45:33.20 --> 00:45:38.64
Another problem associated with the concept of surfaces and gaps is that as we penetrate deeply

508
00:45:38.64 --> 00:45:42.32
Often on narrow fronts our flanks become exposed

509
00:45:43.12 --> 00:45:46.56
There are however compensating factors again related to speed

510
00:45:47.20 --> 00:45:54.40
We are moving quickly the enemy is always off balance remember the old adage there is security in speed

511
00:45:55.84 --> 00:46:00.72
So in other words as you penetrate into a into a zone you're gonna be exposed a little bit

512
00:46:00.72 --> 00:46:10.16
But if you're moving fast you can deal with that exposure

513
00:46:08.80 --> 00:46:16.64
Critics of these faster moving forms of combat characterized by initiative at the low level fear that they will lead groups

514
00:46:17.12 --> 00:46:23.20
To groups of men moving willy nearly about the battlefield and that commanders will lose control

515
00:46:23.20 --> 00:46:27.84
So people say oh, you know if I give so much so much initiative at the low level

516
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:32.56
I'm gonna lose control of it and people are gonna be running around like chickens with their heads cut off

517
00:46:33.28 --> 00:46:39.92
This need not be so if the concept of surfaces and gaps is employed properly it will not be so

518
00:46:40.32 --> 00:46:46.16
That is why we have control measures the boundary the limit of advance the phase line can still be used

519
00:46:46.56 --> 00:46:50.40
It must be remembered that these control measures should serve their function

520
00:46:50.40 --> 00:46:55.28
But not be rigid lines that cannot be changed or ignored when the situation changes

521
00:46:55.28 --> 00:47:00.000
They should be kept to a minimum and must always be flexible

522
00:47:00.56 --> 00:47:07.60
The tactics must never follow the control measures on the contrary the control measures must follow the tactics

523
00:47:08.48 --> 00:47:11.84
And the tactics must always be based on the enemy

524
00:47:12.64 --> 00:47:19.04
Other concepts that will be discussed in the chapters ahead especially that of the main effort

525
00:47:19.04 --> 00:47:27.04
Give us meaning gives us means of keeping control over our troops and preventing a situation where they can be said to be moving

526
00:47:27.44 --> 00:47:29.76
Willy nearly about the battlefield

527
00:47:30.72 --> 00:47:34.16
So decentralized command it it is challenging and

528
00:47:35.28 --> 00:47:37.76
If you don't do it right you will have chaos

529
00:47:40.40 --> 00:47:42.40
So now we get into the next section

530
00:47:42.40 --> 00:47:48.40
It does say lecture again, but again, I'm not here to lecture anybody. I don't think I don't think I can pull that off

531
00:47:50.64 --> 00:47:54.72
The concept this one this section is called mission tactics

532
00:47:57.04 --> 00:48:02.56
The concept of mission tactics like surfaces and gaps must always be at work in battle

533
00:48:03.60 --> 00:48:06.88
The name is the name is derived from the German

534
00:48:06.88 --> 00:48:12.48
Alph-Trags tactic which means literally mission tactics

535
00:48:13.04 --> 00:48:16.80
It is no accident that the naming includes the word tactics

536
00:48:17.52 --> 00:48:21.84
Assigning a mission and depending on subordinates to carry it out

537
00:48:22.24 --> 00:48:29.44
Constituits the tactic to allow the subordinate to decide on his own initiative

538
00:48:29.84 --> 00:48:36.24
What to do is the means of getting the most appropriate decisions made on the spot and acted on

539
00:48:36.24 --> 00:48:39.60
More rapidly than the enemy can respond to your actions

540
00:48:41.76 --> 00:48:43.76
Gotta get your subordinate

541
00:48:43.76 --> 00:48:46.56
Leadership to lead you want them to lead

542
00:48:49.76 --> 00:48:56.40
This is the account of Prince Frederick Charles who is giving a tonn Lashing to one of his majors for committing a tactical

543
00:48:56.40 --> 00:49:00.80
Blunder in defensive his action the major explain that he was only following orders

544
00:49:00.80 --> 00:49:07.44
In the press and army the major reminded the prince and order from a senior officer was tentant about to an order from the king

545
00:49:08.32 --> 00:49:10.32
The prince was on impressed

546
00:49:10.32 --> 00:49:18.48
His reply to the major was the king made you a major because he thought you were smart enough to know when not to obey orders

547
00:49:20.64 --> 00:49:28.24
And that is the essence of mission tactics the subordinate decides what to do even if even if it means that the order

548
00:49:28.24 --> 00:49:38.000
Issued by his senior now should be changed or adjusted the mission assigned is sacred the mission is the output that the commander wants

549
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:46.80
That does not change but how that output is to be achieved may change and it's up to the intelligent

550
00:49:47.84 --> 00:49:51.92
Subordinate to decide whether or not it has

551
00:49:54.80 --> 00:49:56.08
total

552
00:49:56.08 --> 00:49:57.52
freedom

553
00:49:57.52 --> 00:49:59.52
for the subordinate leadership

554
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:04.88
to figure out how they want to make this happen. They know what they need to get done

555
00:50:05.60 --> 00:50:09.44
But they they have the freedom to figure out how they're gonna make it happen

556
00:50:10.72 --> 00:50:16.24
Back to the book there is a classic example used time and time again and introducing the student to mission tactics

557
00:50:16.24 --> 00:50:22.40
It is simple and a value so we'll be used to get here the subordinate is giving the mission of getting his unit across the river

558
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:26.08
Getting his unit across the river is the output the senior desires

559
00:50:26.08 --> 00:50:33.28
The route that he has been given crosses the nearest bridge the junior commander arrives at the site to find that the bridge is been destroyed

560
00:50:33.92 --> 00:50:39.84
He does not stop he does not wait for new orders. He does not request permission to change his route

561
00:50:40.08 --> 00:50:44.24
He goes to the nearest forward several kilometers distance and he crosses there

562
00:50:44.72 --> 00:50:48.24
He informs the senior of course as soon as he can but he does not wait

563
00:50:49.28 --> 00:50:55.12
Remember mission orders are necessary to give the tempo of operations the rapidity that it must have

564
00:50:55.12 --> 00:51:00.000
If we are to keep the enemy off balance so that's a very simple example

565
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:01.84
I tell echo hey

566
00:51:01.84 --> 00:51:06.80
I need your I need your troops across that river go across that bridge you get there the bridges out

567
00:51:06.80 --> 00:51:10.24
You're like oh, I'm still gonna get across the river here. Let's find a point in the place

568
00:51:10.24 --> 00:51:13.52
We can go across or let's make it happen and you're gonna make it happen

569
00:51:14.64 --> 00:51:19.52
Not gonna bother me you're not gonna call me back. You know me hey the bridge is out. We'll meet you now

570
00:51:20.48 --> 00:51:22.48
Something that this is a little bit

571
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:29.52
This is a little bit simplified because the reality is if you're gonna start moving kilometers away from where I anticipated you being

572
00:51:29.52 --> 00:51:35.04
You need to tell me that you're moving you need to tell me because I might have other friendly units in the area that might

573
00:51:35.04 --> 00:51:38.24
Don't expect you I might have big drop in bombs in that area

574
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:43.04
So this is this is actually leaving out some critical coordination that does have to happen

575
00:51:43.28 --> 00:51:47.04
But the initiative to make it happen should happen. Yeah, it seems like you

576
00:51:47.04 --> 00:51:53.60
Like in the in the process of that decentralized command the person carrying out the order is

577
00:51:54.72 --> 00:51:57.04
It's kind of to his discretion how much?

578
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:01.12
He's gonna deviate when something changes like he can't he's of course is gonna deviate

579
00:52:01.12 --> 00:52:06.40
He's gonna make those adjustments, but you don't want a deviate too much right and and honestly

580
00:52:06.40 --> 00:52:10.32
If I was to give you directions hey echo I need you going to cry. I need you across the river

581
00:52:10.32 --> 00:52:16.64
I would literally give you some parameters to work with it. I say don't go don't go further south than this area than this road

582
00:52:16.64 --> 00:52:19.44
And don't go further north than this you can do whatever you want inside of here

583
00:52:19.44 --> 00:52:23.84
So now you can do whatever you want inside that box. Yeah, and how you always talk about you

584
00:52:23.84 --> 00:52:26.80
You'll say like why are you going across the river as well? Yeah

585
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:34.24
And for speaking of why and here's another example of mission orders

586
00:52:35.44 --> 00:52:37.44
This is an actual example

587
00:52:37.44 --> 00:52:46.16
C's control of root six west of the muddy river in order to destroy enemy forces attempting to escape from company

588
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:48.16
Bravo's zone of action

589
00:52:50.24 --> 00:52:51.84
So

590
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:58.64
It's telling you the why that's what the in order to is notice in the mission order the phrase in order to

591
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:02.08
That is a very important phrase and usually ought to go in the mission order

592
00:53:02.08 --> 00:53:09.12
There's no rule that every mission order contain the phrase in order to if you were told attack the enemy company that you see in front of you

593
00:53:09.12 --> 00:53:11.52
It would probably be highly superfluous to tell you why

594
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:16.08
They are there they are threat why waste the breath

595
00:53:16.56 --> 00:53:22.24
But usually your mission order will have the ability to endure time better if you explain the

596
00:53:22.24 --> 00:53:29.28
Spordinate why he is carrying the mission out so you called the seco turning to a little tactical genius over there. Aren't you?

597
00:53:29.28 --> 00:53:32.24
In order to this gives

598
00:53:33.44 --> 00:53:41.60
the order the quality that Eric von Mannstein called long term it can endure the test of time your commander can lose

599
00:53:41.60 --> 00:53:47.68
Communication with you yet you can still carry out his intent because you know what he wanted and you can

600
00:53:47.84 --> 00:53:51.36
Continue to act within his intent for a long time without checking back

601
00:53:52.72 --> 00:53:55.44
Understand why as briefed by

602
00:53:55.44 --> 00:53:58.32
Lieutenant Colonel echo Charles

603
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:10.48
Fixed rules are not appropriate in instructing how to as how to assign missions to often students reject good ideas about tactics

604
00:54:10.48 --> 00:54:15.84
Because they cannot get their thoughts to fit the format of the operation order that is

605
00:54:16.40 --> 00:54:21.20
Being demanded the important thing is that the mission be clear

606
00:54:21.20 --> 00:54:26.80
Compared to clarity format is of little or no consequence

607
00:54:27.28 --> 00:54:28.48
Then this is

608
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:32.96
We talk about it in extreme ownership that these massive power point briefs that

609
00:54:33.68 --> 00:54:38.80
I mean hundreds literally you know hundred to 150 slides to try and make the

610
00:54:40.08 --> 00:54:46.32
To try and brief a mission when and and the leaders would away so much time trying to put these briefs together

611
00:54:46.32 --> 00:54:51.28
And and they would they wouldn't do the planning that they're supposed to be doing they wouldn't be thinking

612
00:54:51.68 --> 00:54:56.96
They'd be building power point slides and I've just had to get these guys to think and

613
00:54:57.68 --> 00:55:00.88
Stop stop working on the power points. Stop trying to match your font

614
00:55:01.60 --> 00:55:06.48
Chop time to equalize the huge on each slide to make it look pretty no don't care

615
00:55:06.96 --> 00:55:11.60
What I want you to think and I want clarity of mission is the most important thing the matter of fact

616
00:55:11.60 --> 00:55:18.16
I didn't want guys running training and any guy says to me it's one of the one of the task units commanders and he says hey, you know

617
00:55:18.16 --> 00:55:26.72
What is it what is it that you're looking for in the brief and he's you know trying to figure out how many slides do I want to see and what format do I want to see and I said

618
00:55:26.96 --> 00:55:30.96
What I want for the brief is that your men understand the operation

619
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:34.48
boom

620
00:55:34.48 --> 00:55:44.80
Back to the book the subordinate receiving that order must be more talented amateur troops awkward clumsy

621
00:55:44.80 --> 00:55:48.72
Untrained troops cannot be expected to carry out mission orders why?

622
00:55:49.60 --> 00:55:55.84
Because as a result of their lack of experience they must be told what to do only the professional experience leader

623
00:55:55.84 --> 00:56:02.16
Can know what to do without being told what to do because we in the Marine Corps set our standard side

624
00:56:02.16 --> 00:56:06.64
We expect that our subordinates will train until they can perform under mission orders

625
00:56:07.20 --> 00:56:12.56
So just I don't know if I made this clear or if I breeze over this part mission orders is exactly

626
00:56:12.96 --> 00:56:15.20
What we're talking about when it comes to hey just tell the person

627
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:18.08
This is what I need done

628
00:56:18.08 --> 00:56:23.60
And this is why I want it done you figured out as opposed to telling them exactly what you want them to do

629
00:56:24.80 --> 00:56:27.76
Commander sent him yes indeed commanders intent

630
00:56:27.76 --> 00:56:37.04
burdens of responsibility increase on both sides on the part of the senior commander so when you're doing mission orders

631
00:56:37.04 --> 00:56:42.40
The burden of responsibility increases on the part of the senior commander and on the part of the subordinate

632
00:56:43.36 --> 00:56:49.60
Look first at the senior commander operating with mission orders his orders must be perfectly clear

633
00:56:50.16 --> 00:56:56.40
The onus is on the senior to define to the junior what must be accomplished without telling him how to do it

634
00:56:56.40 --> 00:57:01.36
The onus is not on the junior to fair it out what his commander wants

635
00:57:02.16 --> 00:57:09.20
The senior must state what he wants otherwise he should not expect to get it now I actually when I when I teach people this

636
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.60
I tell them that the onus is on the junior and if if I tell you to do some

637
00:57:14.64 --> 00:57:19.68
And you don't understand why you're doing it and you don't understand what my intent is and you still go in the field and try and do it

638
00:57:19.68 --> 00:57:23.76
I blame you I mean it's my fault too, but we're both taking ownership

639
00:57:23.76 --> 00:57:29.84
Might even say we're taking extreme ownership of the situation, but really if your boss isn't telling you why you're why you're

640
00:57:29.84 --> 00:57:33.20
Why they're telling you to do something you just raise your hand and ask K boss

641
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:39.04
What's your objective here what's your overall intent? What's the commanders intent? Because I want to make sure if I lose communications with you

642
00:57:39.60 --> 00:57:44.72
I can continue to execute towards your desired end state. So we're looking for

643
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.52
An additional burden of responsibility on the seniors that he must train his subordinates and his unit to

644
00:57:53.52 --> 00:57:59.36
Operate as a team they are not going to be able to perform mission orders without training

645
00:58:00.64 --> 00:58:04.88
Another new burden of responsibility is that he must expect his subordinates to make mistakes

646
00:58:05.36 --> 00:58:11.76
He may not expect zero defects wars are one by people not machines people make mistakes

647
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:14.64
If people are more afraid of making mistakes

648
00:58:14.88 --> 00:58:20.40
Then they are of exercising initiative now and then they will not take risks and they will not exercise initiative

649
00:58:20.40 --> 00:58:24.16
Furthermore, they will not win in war

650
00:58:26.24 --> 00:58:33.44
Perhaps the most important new responsibility is placed on the commander who gives mission orders is that he must trust his subordinates

651
00:58:34.40 --> 00:58:38.16
If trust breaks down the whole system breaks down

652
00:58:38.80 --> 00:58:42.08
So people ask me about trust from time to time and

653
00:58:43.20 --> 00:58:49.20
It's absolutely I use I've talked about relationships the R word and that's what that's what it is and

654
00:58:49.20 --> 00:58:55.92
Lief and I talked about the other day on the podcast is that just building trust how but one of the best ways to build trust is

655
00:58:56.96 --> 00:59:02.32
Give it I give it and so that's what goes back and forth and in the military you do that when you're in the training environment

656
00:59:03.12 --> 00:59:05.12
When there's no risk

657
00:59:05.12 --> 00:59:09.44
Or very very tiny risk of life and limb. There's no strategic left you're not your risk

658
00:59:09.44 --> 00:59:11.76
You're not going to lose the war so I'm going to let you run with stuff

659
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:15.60
I want you to learn I want you to take risk and if you fail if you screw something up

660
00:59:15.60 --> 00:59:23.84
I don't try and fire you we try and learn from it and that encourages you to take initiative and keep getting after it

661
00:59:30.24 --> 00:59:34.88
Now the the we're moving to the next section

662
00:59:36.56 --> 00:59:38.56
Which is called the main effort

663
00:59:38.56 --> 00:59:47.84
the commander in making his plan must determine what and where his main effort is in every

664
00:59:47.92 --> 00:59:52.24
Operation whether it be offensive defensive or withdrawal

665
00:59:53.44 --> 01:00:01.76
This main effort should be specified in the operation order it should always be clearly stated in paragraph three a the concept of operation

666
01:00:01.76 --> 01:00:10.000
There can only be one main effort when you start giving two or three or a three part main effort

667
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:15.44
You'd better look back at it because the chances are you do you have not made up your mind

668
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:18.08
What you are trying to do

669
01:00:20.40 --> 01:00:25.36
So if you're trying to plan a mission you're telling you're telling people there's three main things

670
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:28.64
We're trying to get done no wrong. There should be one yep

671
01:00:28.64 --> 01:00:32.64
Yeah in message conveyance

672
01:00:34.32 --> 01:00:39.52
Actually, I think it's a newspaper writing they call it bearing the lead it's like your main story

673
01:00:40.72 --> 01:00:47.60
Has to you know you can't have three main stories in one article got it because and you know one story is gonna have cool details

674
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:53.92
But you start spending a bunch of time on these cool details they call that bearing the lead

675
01:00:53.92 --> 01:01:00.24
Uh, bad deal and so don't do that on the newspaper business and don't do that on that'll feel

676
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:08.88
Every unit commander down to the company commander will always assign a main effort and sometimes even a platoon commander should

677
01:01:09.84 --> 01:01:15.76
The entire command must be aware of what and where the main effort is

678
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:19.52
The commander can change the main effort at any time

679
01:01:19.52 --> 01:01:25.36
This is what gives the operation its fluidity and and this is one of the

680
01:01:26.96 --> 01:01:31.20
Pretty common issues that we run it ran into it when I was running training

681
01:01:31.84 --> 01:01:37.12
Run into it now in the business world where you work with a company and they're not they're not assigning a main effort

682
01:01:37.12 --> 01:01:43.12
They're concentrating on 14 different things at the same time. They don't prioritize next gives this is another form of prioritize next cute

683
01:01:43.12 --> 01:01:50.64
And that's a problem because if you're trying to do 14 things it wants you're gonna not the compost any of them

684
01:01:52.48 --> 01:01:55.84
The German word for main effort is shit-poked

685
01:01:57.28 --> 01:02:03.20
Anytime in your readings when you see that and often you will see it written in italics the German word shfrit punk

686
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:08.32
Take note because it is one of the most important underlying concepts in everything the Germans do

687
01:02:08.32 --> 01:02:13.60
Make the main effort where the enemy least expects you

688
01:02:15.12 --> 01:02:18.72
Make the enemy make the main effort where the enemy is weak

689
01:02:19.76 --> 01:02:21.76
Be prepared to be surprised

690
01:02:23.36 --> 01:02:25.36
So let's go I gotta stop right there

691
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:31.44
It's interesting you know when you see the big fortified area of the enemy you say okay

692
01:02:31.44 --> 01:02:39.60
We're gonna we better we better attack that hard no wrong answer that's a surface we're looking for gaps so don't make the main effort

693
01:02:40.48 --> 01:02:47.44
The the strong point make it the weak point back to the book be prepared to be surprised

694
01:02:48.32 --> 01:02:53.60
Be weary of the council do not ever be surprised in war you will be surprised

695
01:02:54.16 --> 01:02:56.80
The task is to learn to deal with surprise

696
01:02:56.80 --> 01:03:02.40
If what you thought would be an enemy weakness becomes the enemy strength you should not be disrupted

697
01:03:02.96 --> 01:03:10.16
If your taxes tactics are fluid you can deal with surprise you will shift your main effort to enemy weakness and go on through

698
01:03:10.96 --> 01:03:13.52
That is how the main effort works in the offense

699
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Fluidity

700
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.92
Remember we even hear it a lot about in the Vietnam war the the Vietcong were too rigid they would just try their plan

701
01:03:23.92 --> 01:03:30.32
Didn't have the fluidity the main effort should be directed against enemy weakness not enemy strength

702
01:03:30.40 --> 01:03:37.28
Here you see the interconnection between the concepts the connection between the concept of the main effort and the concept of surfaces and gaps

703
01:03:37.84 --> 01:03:46.16
All the concepts are worked together at the same time the main effort cannot be understood in isolation from surfaces and gaps because it is directed against enemy weakness

704
01:03:46.16 --> 01:03:54.48
And another another

705
01:03:55.60 --> 01:04:00.56
One of the four laws combat that we talk about in the book extreme ownership is simplicity

706
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Simple back to the book even the principle of simplicity can be recognized in the concept of the main effort

707
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.52
Instead of trying to do 10 different things we are focusing on one

708
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:16.16
There will be many other efforts going on at the same time, but all in some way

709
01:04:16.56 --> 01:04:18.88
Directed at making the main effort succeed

710
01:04:19.84 --> 01:04:22.48
So what do you gain from this main effort?

711
01:04:22.96 --> 01:04:29.44
You gain direction you great you gain fluidity you gain speed and you prevent

712
01:04:29.68 --> 01:04:32.16
Disappaining your efforts all over the battlefield

713
01:04:33.36 --> 01:04:39.76
The way the polls did when the Germans invaded Poland they tried to defend their entire 800 mile front

714
01:04:39.76 --> 01:04:44.40
There was no main effort and by trying to be strong everywhere

715
01:04:44.80 --> 01:04:47.12
They weren't fact strong nowhere

716
01:04:48.32 --> 01:04:53.84
This trying to cover all the bases is a common error in the amateur commanders plan

717
01:04:54.16 --> 01:05:02.56
It is a symptom of avoidance of decision making avoidance of decision making so if you're not saying hey here's what we're gonna focus on you're just

718
01:05:02.88 --> 01:05:06.24
I'm gonna wait. I don't want to decide yet. Oh, I'm not ready to commit

719
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:11.52
By establishing a main effort you make a clear decision

720
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:18.88
You obviate the necessity for junior officers to keep asking for guidance

721
01:05:19.36 --> 01:05:24.96
If they know their commanders main effort they can continue to operate even though communications may be cut and

722
01:05:24.96 --> 01:05:31.20
They can continue to operate at a high tempo because they need not keep checking back for new orders

723
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:40.48
In here we get to another something you might recognize from from our book

724
01:05:41.04 --> 01:05:46.64
Stream ownership when the commander has made this decision he has done something very necessary

725
01:05:47.52 --> 01:05:49.52
He has done something very ethical

726
01:05:50.40 --> 01:05:53.60
He has assumed and taken responsibility

727
01:05:54.56 --> 01:05:57.12
For what will happen if the battle goes a ride?

728
01:05:57.12 --> 01:06:04.72
He cannot blame his subordinates. He can only blame himself. It was he who decided what was to be done

729
01:06:05.68 --> 01:06:08.72
And designated a main effort in order to do it

730
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:14.08
Therefore it takes courage and moral character to select a main effort

731
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:16.64
That is why the weak

732
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:24.64
Commander and the amateur so often failed to do this in fact the weak commander will actively avoid choosing a main effort

733
01:06:24.64 --> 01:06:32.08
His very convenient for the commander weak and character to avoid selecting the main effort because if the battle goes on

734
01:06:32.08 --> 01:06:35.20
Favorably he can blame someone else for the mistake

735
01:06:36.32 --> 01:06:41.92
The commander who has taken the stand and selected his own main effort cannot do this

736
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:48.56
Therefore in a sense the main effort is a moral commitment

737
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:54.32
Taking some ownership by selecting the main effort

738
01:06:55.36 --> 01:06:57.36
And you got to dig that

739
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.32
The next concept in again, you know I'm I'm cruising through this book like I always do only reading

740
01:07:06.32 --> 01:07:08.32
I don't know probably

741
01:07:09.36 --> 01:07:12.72
A very small percentage of it 15 percent and

742
01:07:13.92 --> 01:07:15.92
There's a ton in here

743
01:07:15.92 --> 01:07:17.92
And it actually has some very cool

744
01:07:20.88 --> 01:07:27.04
Like exercises where it gives you a scenario that's happening and you go through and you figure out what you would do and it gives you good solutions

745
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:29.44
So it's gotten it's got it's it's a great book to look at

746
01:07:31.04 --> 01:07:33.04
The next lecture

747
01:07:33.92 --> 01:07:35.92
Is called the concept of the objective

748
01:07:37.52 --> 01:07:43.84
According to the chair according to joint chiefs and staff publication number one dictionary of military and associated terms

749
01:07:43.84 --> 01:07:48.56
The objective is the physical object of the action taken a

750
01:07:49.68 --> 01:07:56.08
Definite tactical feature seizure and or holding of which is essential to the commander's plan

751
01:07:57.44 --> 01:07:59.44
That definition is clear enough

752
01:08:00.96 --> 01:08:06.10
Basel the del heart would have disagreed with the JCS definition at one point in his writings

753
01:08:06.16 --> 01:08:10.56
The del heart stated the only real objective is the enemy

754
01:08:10.56 --> 01:08:12.56
The

755
01:08:12.56 --> 01:08:20.24
The del heart statement is also quite clear and understandable especially when we realize that whether we are attacking or defending the problem is always the enemy

756
01:08:21.20 --> 01:08:26.64
Once the enemy is taking out of the action defending and attacking are no longer necessary

757
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:34.96
Now

758
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:36.56
The the

759
01:08:36.56 --> 01:08:42.40
I guess the controversy here if we could call it that is the objective not being a

760
01:08:43.28 --> 01:08:46.64
Specific piece of terrain. It's the the objective is the enemy

761
01:08:48.72 --> 01:08:50.72
But that being said

762
01:08:52.48 --> 01:08:57.52
The terrain of course is extremely important we must use it to gain advantage

763
01:08:57.68 --> 01:09:05.68
But the object of the attack is the enemy the objective must be to take the enemy out of action to destroy him to disarm him

764
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:10.96
We cannot do that simply by seizing a piece of terrain in holding it we must be prepared to move

765
01:09:11.20 --> 01:09:16.48
Continually wherever necessary to confuse and disrupt him through a combination of fire and movement

766
01:09:20.40 --> 01:09:24.000
When the term objective appears it means an aiming point

767
01:09:24.40 --> 01:09:31.76
That towards which we direct our efforts in order to best use the terrain to accomplish our final goal the destruction of the enemy

768
01:09:31.76 --> 01:09:39.76
The ability to wisely select an objective is the mark of a good commander

769
01:09:40.16 --> 01:09:47.44
The inability is the mark of an amateur and history is replete with examples of poorly selected objectives

770
01:09:48.24 --> 01:09:54.88
There were hills fought for bravely by Marines at Vietnam after they ceased being of any tactical value

771
01:09:54.88 --> 01:10:03.84
Lives were thrown away for meaningless terrain terrain that did not meet either of the two main criteria for selecting an objective

772
01:10:04.64 --> 01:10:12.40
two main criteria are one that is loop that it be useful to you or two deer to your enemy

773
01:10:13.20 --> 01:10:15.20
If it is neither one of these

774
01:10:15.76 --> 01:10:19.04
It is probably not worth the life of a single Marine

775
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:24.96
Any good commander will therefore select terrain that is useful to him

776
01:10:25.52 --> 01:10:31.20
The great commander will have the ability to select terrain that is deer to the enemy

777
01:10:36.08 --> 01:10:41.28
In the final concept is the concept of the reserve

778
01:10:41.28 --> 01:10:53.12
General JFC follower of the British Army the original author of the nine principles of war that the US Army was to adopt in the 1920s

779
01:10:53.44 --> 01:10:58.40
Once stated that of all the principles he developed the most important was economy of force

780
01:10:59.44 --> 01:11:05.60
He reasoned that whichever side still had forces left after the other sides had been committed was bound to win

781
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:16.48
Napoleon seems to have had similar thoughts when he observed that whoever still had his reserve remaining after his enemy had committed his reserve would win the battle

782
01:11:18.88 --> 01:11:20.88
And here's another

783
01:11:20.88 --> 01:11:22.88
quote in here from Napoleon

784
01:11:23.52 --> 01:11:28.40
That I think when they're talking about committing and it talks about your mindset on the battlefield

785
01:11:28.40 --> 01:11:40.32
From Napoleon if I appear to be always ready to reply to everything it is because before undertaking anything

786
01:11:40.72 --> 01:11:45.84
I have meditated for a long time I have for seeing what might happen

787
01:11:47.60 --> 01:11:55.52
It is not a spirit which suddenly reveals to me what I have to say or do in a circumstances in a circumstance unexpected by others

788
01:11:55.52 --> 01:11:58.96
It is a reflection a meditation

789
01:12:01.20 --> 01:12:06.32
So Napoleon he was good to have these quick reactions and everyone says wow he must have just had this

790
01:12:06.96 --> 01:12:11.20
Incredible you know he's calling a spirit this comes to him and says hey move these guys over here

791
01:12:11.20 --> 01:12:14.24
Hey, I sold that flag no here. He fought through this thing for hours

792
01:12:15.04 --> 01:12:19.28
He said if they do this I'm gonna do that if they come over here. I'm gonna be ready over here

793
01:12:21.20 --> 01:12:23.20
preparation

794
01:12:23.20 --> 01:12:34.000
What Napoleon was saying was that thorough thought in advance prepared him to make split second decisions when the situation suddenly changed

795
01:12:39.28 --> 01:12:41.28
Preparation

796
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.72
Preparation is key

797
01:12:44.72 --> 01:12:57.36
Now that wraps up the book and I hope that it provides some reminders and some insight to people not only to the war fighters out on the battlefield

798
01:12:57.36 --> 01:13:05.76
But as I said in the beginning I hope it provides some details in a dealing with humans with people and problems

799
01:13:05.76 --> 01:13:13.04
In the business world in leadership positions on that you just do math in life

800
01:13:15.04 --> 01:13:22.08
Whatever you're doing or whatever you're trying to get done think of how you can use maneuver warfare

801
01:13:23.44 --> 01:13:25.44
To make it happen

802
01:13:28.64 --> 01:13:30.64
And I guess we can

803
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:36.72
Go over to some some questions from the interwebs and

804
01:13:38.48 --> 01:13:42.72
I guess before we go to the interwebs, maybe you could tell us about the interwebs and

805
01:13:44.40 --> 01:13:46.40
What we can do to support

806
01:13:47.44 --> 01:13:54.32
Support by being on interwebs if you're on the interwebs and you're in the mood to support this podcast and or yourself

807
01:13:54.32 --> 01:13:59.84
With supplementation go to on it dot com slash jockel

808
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:05.60
Get on its supplements are the best ones I like that idea. Yeah

809
01:14:06.56 --> 01:14:09.84
Krill it's a good idea Krill oil for sure for you joint get in

810
01:14:10.64 --> 01:14:17.84
To bring some of that out for briny yeah some shrimp tech sport mode. Yeah, shrimp tech sport if you're into performance

811
01:14:18.72 --> 01:14:22.96
Physical activity performance if you feel you need a little turbo boost. Yeah

812
01:14:22.96 --> 01:14:24.96
Yeah, yeah, I was funny remember

813
01:14:26.56 --> 01:14:31.20
Tim Kennedy put it in like real real good terms in my opinion when he used like oh

814
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:34.24
Yeah, when I took the shrimp tech it's kind of like

815
01:14:35.44 --> 01:14:41.04
Cuz okay, so you don't want to get confusing be like I'm gonna take the shrimp tech in it's like a like a caffeine boost or something

816
01:14:41.04 --> 01:14:45.92
You know, you don't because it's not that's not so it's and he put in these terms where he's like you know

817
01:14:45.92 --> 01:14:51.20
He you go a few rounds you go five six seven and you know however many rounds and everyone's like real poop

818
01:14:51.20 --> 01:14:56.40
But then you're kind of like I could go a few more rounds and really that is that is exactly how it is

819
01:14:56.40 --> 01:15:00.80
This one or when you're hitting towards the end of the round or whatever it's like you you feel solid

820
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:05.28
You know, just you know, I guess apparently what it does is it helps you utilize your oxygen

821
01:15:05.28 --> 01:15:08.40
Yeah, and you'll feel like work. I mean obviously you're talking about your jitsu

822
01:15:08.56 --> 01:15:10.56
Which for those people that don't train jitsu?

823
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:12.56
Which you should but if you don't

824
01:15:13.36 --> 01:15:15.36
Well you should

825
01:15:15.36 --> 01:15:18.08
But you're also gonna keep working out and you have the

826
01:15:18.08 --> 01:15:23.68
You know you so sort of a metabolic conditioning type type workout situation going on

827
01:15:24.56 --> 01:15:28.96
Remember how it's how telling you I did my met come metabolic conditioning after I yes

828
01:15:28.96 --> 01:15:32.48
Like normal lifting so I'll probably do in the reverse of that lately really

829
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:37.04
I don't know I would have I think I was super warmed up. I'm dripping with sweat

830
01:15:37.04 --> 01:15:43.60
Yeah, and I just and I feel really good and then I figure maybe the opposite will happen because we both know if you go

831
01:15:43.60 --> 01:15:48.72
With your with your strength movements first you take a little bit off your metcon strike right?

832
01:15:49.12 --> 01:15:52.08
Yeah, if if you do and so that way when you do

833
01:15:52.64 --> 01:15:56.88
The metcon fresh you feel like super man right? Yeah, blasted your muscles out

834
01:15:57.44 --> 01:16:01.68
So I've been doing the reverse though when I'm doing the metcon type

835
01:16:02.32 --> 01:16:06.24
First and then I just breathe it out and then I get them there and be stuff

836
01:16:06.24 --> 01:16:11.84
Yeah, and I dig it on the only reason I say I dig it because you're savage like that but

837
01:16:11.84 --> 01:16:16.64
Consider because those are two what depend depend what kind of lifting you're doing

838
01:16:16.64 --> 01:16:20.64
Yeah, so let's say if not well if you're lifting like for strength or you know

839
01:16:21.04 --> 01:16:28.16
Muscle growth or whatever you should do that first because the results you seek are in line with you having full energy

840
01:16:28.48 --> 01:16:30.48
You lifting I agree with you

841
01:16:30.48 --> 01:16:36.40
And you think you're correct and the metcon isn't the results of the metcon is for you to recover from conditioning

842
01:16:36.40 --> 01:16:39.52
See it's muscular conditioning so if you're tired going in

843
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:44.40
That's more conditioning you have to recover from better access. Yeah, so it's so essentially

844
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:48.84
But hey if you want to reverse it give your body some some some stuff to your health

845
01:16:49.36 --> 01:16:55.36
This is funny because I completely agree with you and I've only been doing this for a couple months and I

846
01:16:55.36 --> 01:16:58.04
You know what it was you know what it was one day

847
01:16:58.04 --> 01:17:03.24
I was I was gonna do like a metcon pretty strong. It was feeling good sure and then I got done

848
01:17:03.24 --> 01:17:10.56
I said so I was I'm just gonna move some you know, but some some heavy get my lift on and when I when I went heavy

849
01:17:10.56 --> 01:17:12.08
I was like man that feels good

850
01:17:12.08 --> 01:17:17.04
Great all loose some all warm and so now I've just kind of started doing it a little bit

851
01:17:17.04 --> 01:17:21.44
Yeah, and if you get used to that then it'll start to be more and more benefit

852
01:17:21.44 --> 01:17:24.34
I used to I used to run on the treadmill. I used to do like three and a half miles

853
01:17:24.34 --> 01:17:27.32
I'm in four miles and then lift

854
01:17:27.32 --> 01:17:32.88
Just because I didn't have time and and every time I lived I would never feel like running the you know the mile

855
01:17:32.88 --> 01:17:35.48
Afterwards I do not tread no, so I

856
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:40.80
So I mean what I'm gonna get the running out of the way that I'm gonna lift and then I was like dang lifting is kind of harder

857
01:17:40.80 --> 01:17:44.72
But I'd wait rather endure this discomfort when I'm lifting then when I'm running on the treadmill

858
01:17:44.72 --> 01:17:48.50
But I did that for months and months and months and then one day I didn't run. I was like

859
01:17:48.92 --> 01:17:52.88
It was weird. I was like stiff. Yeah, so you can't even use to it

860
01:17:52.88 --> 01:17:58.10
But either way. I mean what my original point is I do the met now. I do the Mechon after I live

861
01:17:58.50 --> 01:18:02.44
Doing the Mechon after that lift that has been my standard for so long

862
01:18:02.76 --> 01:18:08.36
Right, but you know how you're saying do the Mechon before you live or or you're just doing the Mechon that it's easier

863
01:18:08.68 --> 01:18:11.72
Yeah, because you're not a start-up thing. Yeah, yeah

864
01:18:12.40 --> 01:18:16.24
Yeah, but I'm anyway my original point was the shroom tech

865
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:21.08
So if you're doing that kind of thing after you lift when you're going into the Mechon you can feel way better

866
01:18:21.08 --> 01:18:26.84
You want to hear something cool. So a lot of times people ask me what is your workout?

867
01:18:27.16 --> 01:18:29.76
Right, they want to know reps sets

868
01:18:30.72 --> 01:18:36.72
Wait yeah, right and that's cool. Of course and I haven't I haven't put it out there for

869
01:18:38.24 --> 01:18:40.24
Well, I'm I got a book

870
01:18:40.88 --> 01:18:45.02
Putting together a book. Let's go to have a book kind of thing. I just not gonna be any books. I'm a little boy

871
01:18:45.02 --> 01:18:51.74
Yeah, I got a real legit book on which means gonna take a little more time

872
01:18:51.74 --> 01:18:57.74
But I'd rather do it do it right, but what's interesting is this is what's so cool so

873
01:18:58.58 --> 01:19:04.74
People that people listen to podcasts and ask and they have been applying the basic principles

874
01:19:05.02 --> 01:19:08.78
Because I have never put I haven't put out. I don't think I put out a single workout

875
01:19:08.78 --> 01:19:16.42
I also people say what do you actually eat? Right then want to know what I had for breakfast lunch dinner

876
01:19:16.42 --> 01:19:17.42
What I had for snacks whatever

877
01:19:17.42 --> 01:19:20.74
Yeah, all I say is like oh, you know, I mostly you know

878
01:19:20.74 --> 01:19:25.82
I I low very low carbs. I eat a lot of meat. I do a lot of protein. I eat a lot of fat

879
01:19:26.30 --> 01:19:27.66
Okay

880
01:19:27.66 --> 01:19:33.32
What do you do for workouts? I get up early in the morning. I hit it hard. You know, am I doing squats and doing poultry

881
01:19:33.32 --> 01:19:38.80
Doing it just basic stuff right now put those basic principles out there well

882
01:19:38.80 --> 01:19:43.50
There's people troopers that have been applying these basic principles

883
01:19:43.50 --> 01:19:49.48
And they're making incredible progress in their lives. They're getting stronger. They're getting leaner

884
01:19:49.64 --> 01:19:52.68
They're getting in better shape. So it's actually

885
01:19:53.68 --> 01:19:56.92
proven because I remember you and I talked about this long time ago. I said listen

886
01:19:58.12 --> 01:20:02.40
It's more about the commanders intent right that they're working out about the commanders intent

887
01:20:02.40 --> 01:20:08.76
It's not about I'm gonna tell you how many reps and sets to do. I'm gonna tell you what you want to make happen

888
01:20:08.76 --> 01:20:13.16
Right, I'm gonna tell you where you want what where you want to be at the end of this workout

889
01:20:13.92 --> 01:20:15.92
physically and mentally and

890
01:20:16.32 --> 01:20:20.48
And and people have been taking that and I mean all kinds of people

891
01:20:21.08 --> 01:20:25.16
They have lost 28 pounds of lost 42 pounds just from

892
01:20:25.76 --> 01:20:29.88
Applying the basic principles that I and and so those will be consolidated in the book

893
01:20:29.88 --> 01:20:34.92
So that people can follow them and they'll be some other good stuff in the book to basic philosophy

894
01:20:38.88 --> 01:20:43.40
Well, that was kind of a tangent on on it wasn't it well, I rightly so I think

895
01:20:44.04 --> 01:20:46.68
Right that he so I think so it's it's

896
01:20:47.68 --> 01:20:54.32
Which which actually kind of brings me to my point that consistency is probably the most overlooked that even though people know

897
01:20:54.32 --> 01:20:59.08
Yeah, you gotta be consistent. We got it but that's kind of everything because everything else is variable

898
01:20:59.08 --> 01:21:01.88
Like you can there's a

899
01:21:03.16 --> 01:21:05.64
Billion different work by consistency do you mean

900
01:21:08.40 --> 01:21:15.80
Doing of the same thing or you just mean doing it every day getting in there. I ain't it. Yeah, absolutely not skipping days weeks

901
01:21:15.80 --> 01:21:17.98
You know getting off the horse, you know that kind of stuff

902
01:21:18.32 --> 01:21:22.02
There's a million different workouts. You can do that will give you results and

903
01:21:22.02 --> 01:21:28.96
There's the nine different results that you can you can kind of strive for and get because it just so many same thing with diet

904
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:33.82
Like you can you know you people have their rigid diet philosophy, but the fact is that

905
01:21:34.54 --> 01:21:38.22
Many different diets work. Yeah, I mean there's some basic principles

906
01:21:38.22 --> 01:21:43.38
You don't need a bunch of sugar. You don't need a bunch of fast food. You don't you know the obvious things to avoid

907
01:21:44.10 --> 01:21:48.78
And you can get results with many kinds of diet and I would go one step further

908
01:21:48.78 --> 01:21:55.66
What you're talking about consistency in in in order to have consistency that requires the distance

909
01:21:56.22 --> 01:22:03.14
It does require the discipline. So that's the factor. Yep. That is the key factor and when people apply the discipline to their lives boom

910
01:22:03.14 --> 01:22:09.02
Right now we think becomes consistent and that's everything. You know so the books can come in the books can talk about that

911
01:22:09.78 --> 01:22:11.78
There you go

912
01:22:11.78 --> 01:22:18.10

That's a good one. I think if you like shirts

939
01:24:17.72 --> 01:24:20.88
Let's say disciplining equals three and most people do have to wear shirts

940
01:24:20.88 --> 01:24:25.24
So some juncture during the day sure you can't get into the restaurant without a tattoo

941

942
01:24:29.04 --> 01:24:34.24
But yeah, there's some shirts on there. You like them get a shirt. That's a good way to support or a bumper sticker

962
01:25:58.44 --> 01:26:04.76
I guess with that let's get down to the questions from the troopers on the interwebs

For those don't know that's karma-graegher you have to see fighter

967
01:26:19.12 --> 01:26:25.52
What would you focus on to try and make up the jiu-jitsu disparity all defense?

968
01:26:28.60 --> 01:26:32.04
Interesting and if you don't know what's going on

969
01:26:34.64 --> 01:26:37.16
Conor McGregor is fighting made Diaz again

970
01:26:37.72 --> 01:26:39.72
202 UFC

971
01:26:39.72 --> 01:26:45.76
So a lot of times I don't like to talk about this kind of thing because it's by the time this comes out

972
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:50.20
It'll be you by the time you're listening to this might be over don't care anymore

973
01:26:50.20 --> 01:26:57.36
But there is a a principle here a concept behind this that does make sense to try and discuss so people can

974
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.04
Learn and improve and something for me to think about my game

975
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:06.000
So you got this guy who's a really good striker going against a guy who's a

976
01:27:07.04 --> 01:27:12.52
Pretty good striker himself very good. Yeah, very good and that's one of the things that this is

977
01:27:12.52 --> 01:27:21.60
This is the question the way it sets it up as if jiu-jitsu is the is the only thing that Nate Diaz is better at

978
01:27:22.60 --> 01:27:28.08
That might not necessarily be the truth and in fact in their first fight it was the striking

979
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:34.32
Of Nate Diaz that forced Conor McGregor to shoot a sloppy take down

980
01:27:34.80 --> 01:27:39.64
Take it to ground and once you got on the ground the jiu-jitsu from ADS was just way too much for

981
01:27:39.64 --> 01:27:43.92
For McGregor so this question

982
01:27:46.24 --> 01:27:54.64
It's almost a little bit off because the question shouldn't be that there's just a jiu-jitsu disparity the question should be

983
01:27:55.56 --> 01:27:58.56
You know what is how would you make up for the fighting

984
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:03.04
Disparity or maybe not even that it's how would you go against what would you tell Connor?

985
01:28:03.04 --> 01:28:08.40
What would you work on? Yeah, what's the strategy? So let's just look at as an overall strategic question

986
01:28:08.40 --> 01:28:13.16
You got a guy that's pretty that's what what what is he good at that's the question

987
01:28:13.16 --> 01:28:15.16
What is he good at one of the strengths of Conor McGregor?

988
01:28:15.32 --> 01:28:22.78
He's fast he's strong, but strong might not even come to play because our Diaz walking on a 200 pounds right now

989
01:28:22.78 --> 01:28:27.88
The fight no 170 so he's gonna just call it a lot of way. He's gonna be big and strong. He's gonna be a better shape for this fight

990
01:28:30.76 --> 01:28:35.64
Conor is pretty good with some unorthodox stuff his striking is fast and

991
01:28:35.64 --> 01:28:43.52
Fairly dynamic so those are the things that he has going form what is Nate Diaz have going form his jiu-jitsu is really good

992
01:28:45.80 --> 01:28:48.92
Yeah, I'm just a jujitsu sec his

993
01:28:49.92 --> 01:28:53.36
Striking is especially his boxing is not a big kicker

994
01:28:54.24 --> 01:28:55.60
so

995
01:28:55.60 --> 01:29:01.44
If I was if I was McGregor here's what I'd be doing I mean what I'd be working my wrestling we work my underhoax of course

996
01:29:01.44 --> 01:29:06.44
and in getting control and getting back to my feet

997
01:29:06.92 --> 01:29:11.000
When I get taken down you immediately getting back to my feet

998
01:29:11.40 --> 01:29:14.84
The way I would fight if I was Conor McGregor is I would

999
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:20.36
Back off with the hard punches. I would throw a lot of really fast

1000
01:29:21.04 --> 01:29:25.000
Light punches and I'd move around a lot and just try and touch and go

1001
01:29:25.24 --> 01:29:28.20
That's what I do if I was Conor McGregor

1002
01:29:28.20 --> 01:29:34.52
I would possibly start in the middle of the second round maybe into the third round five round fight

1003
01:29:34.52 --> 01:29:36.04
I might start throwing some leg kicks

1004
01:29:36.44 --> 01:29:38.44
He doesn't

1005
01:29:38.44 --> 01:29:43.36
Nate sometimes doesn't even check leg kicks, so maybe you can start putting on herding on him if you if you throw enough of those

1006
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:48.72
But in jujitsu wise, I would teach him to disengage

1007
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:54.04
disengage because you don't want to get go you don't want to get in the U to loop

1008
01:29:55.08 --> 01:29:57.08
with the heat that

1009
01:29:57.08 --> 01:30:04.20
McGregor does not want to get into a loop situation with with DS because he can't keep up with him

1010
01:30:04.60 --> 01:30:06.60
He'll be he'll be changing

1011
01:30:06.60 --> 01:30:12.12
He'll be going to the next thing going to the next thing going to the next thing and Conor McGregor will be going to get copy-hined and he'll

1012
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:19.04
won't be able to do it. So I teach him to get no now one thing that does make you just a little bit harder if you're if you're you're an iron to injuditzer

1013
01:30:20.04 --> 01:30:25.12
And you're goal you're not you you actually disengage for me and you're just like your whole goal

1014
01:30:25.12 --> 01:30:27.12
If we were on the mat shook hands

1015
01:30:27.52 --> 01:30:32.60
Slap bump and we're gonna roll and all you did try to do is stay away from me. It would be a really hard round for me

1016
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:39.04
It would be harder than if you attacked me. Yeah, it's harder than if you attacked me and when I did take you down

1017
01:30:39.04 --> 01:30:43.88
All you did was try and get back up. You didn't try and close a guardian trying to attack me with any submissions

1018
01:30:43.88 --> 01:30:47.44
You just try to get back up and get away from me. That is a much harder round for me

1019
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.28
Then if you actually come at me with your full board jujitsu

1020
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:54.92
Right because then it's jujitsu versus jujitsu and I have an advantage

1021
01:30:55.92 --> 01:31:04.64
But if it's jujitsu of mine versus run away from you now I got to run after you now. It's it's a more fair fight

1022
01:31:05.84 --> 01:31:11.72
So that's what that's what McGregor needs to do he needs to use his speed and his

1023
01:31:14.08 --> 01:31:20.52
Yeah, use his speed and then I think that's his biggest advantage the other thing that I find about

1024
01:31:20.52 --> 01:31:29.04
The DS brothers that I wish that I could I wish they I wish they would not train so much triathlon and train more explosive

1025
01:31:29.04 --> 01:31:33.20
I wish he was a little bit stronger both Nate and neck. I mean those guys are awesome and

1026
01:31:33.88 --> 01:31:40.24
They're they're great fighters, but they've they really train had they do they do literally do triathlons

1027
01:31:40.24 --> 01:31:44.88
And so you're not getting explosive muscles now it shows that they have great cardio

1028
01:31:44.88 --> 01:31:49.92
But I'd rather just they were a little bit more explosive. That's that's my personal opinion

1029
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:59.60
Yeah, I dig it I have no advice. I think Nate is so well rounded in this quest as far as this matchup goes

1030
01:32:00.88 --> 01:32:02.88
I

1031
01:32:02.88 --> 01:32:09.88
Like just like that first fight yeah the first fight though you watch the first round. It's not it's not a pushover

1032
01:32:09.88 --> 01:32:13.28
It's gonna be a tough fight man. Yeah. That's an end. That's not what I'm saying

1033
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.48
And I'm saying it's for you know you know how like you know you attack the weaker points

1034
01:32:18.72 --> 01:32:23.20
Right, you know like let's say I'm a way better striker than one guy and his duty to his way better than mine

1035
01:32:23.20 --> 01:32:28.68
I can stay on you know it's obvious that's where I'm gonna talk but in this case, it's not like that. So I'm not yeah

1036
01:32:28.68 --> 01:32:30.68
I don't know man

1037
01:32:30.68 --> 01:32:36.04
It's helpful. It's a tough fight for it for Connor. I stopped fight for for Nate to me

1038
01:32:36.04 --> 01:32:37.64
There were some

1039
01:32:37.64 --> 01:32:41.92
Yeah, yeah, we wasn't even the ending of the fight was very lobstided

1040
01:32:41.92 --> 01:32:48.24
Right the first round it was a little closer and I think Connor thought he had magic

1041
01:32:49.36 --> 01:32:52.80
Yeah, I thought that some of it he even said in a post-flight press conference. He said

1042
01:32:53.44 --> 01:32:56.88
You know he was the big a man and and I

1043
01:32:57.92 --> 01:33:03.44
I hit him with everything I got most of those would stop a smaller man. Yeah, they didn't stop him and I think that's got to be

1044
01:33:04.28 --> 01:33:06.88
That's got to be hard. Yeah, I think that got to him psychologically

1045
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:13.34
So if he's prepared for that psychological this time maybe he'll be able to stick with a game plan and not shoot

1046
01:33:13.34 --> 01:33:18.08
Yeah, on him which was ridiculous yeah, and even the shoot it wasn't just like hey

1047
01:33:18.08 --> 01:33:19.98
I'm gonna decide to shoot it was kind of like a

1048
01:33:21.36 --> 01:33:27.58
Ditch effort yeah, kind of kind of rock to and now you shoot you're rocked and you have to content with Nate

1049
01:33:27.58 --> 01:33:30.72
Diaz, you do so it's like it's not just I gotta continue with Nate

1050
01:33:30.72 --> 01:33:35.16
You do you do to which is bad enough by the way, but you're rocked and it was like a desperation thing

1051
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:40.76
You got to deal with it then you get that so it seemed like oh so quick, but it was like it was just a bunch of compounding factors

1052
01:33:40.76 --> 01:33:45.08
And culminated in that the joke didn't work out looking forward to watching that. Yeah

1053
01:33:45.64 --> 01:33:50.32
All right, great next question. Joko like you many leaders began as rebels

1054
01:33:52.92 --> 01:33:55.76
Joko's the rep. I'll tell you about his band

1055
01:33:56.68 --> 01:34:02.12
One day how did you learn to see the game? Yeah, man that Elgin told you about

1056
01:34:02.12 --> 01:34:04.12
Yeah, man

1057
01:34:04.12 --> 01:34:06.12
And then you told me about you

1058
01:34:06.12 --> 01:34:08.12
How did you learn to see the game and

1059
01:34:09.32 --> 01:34:11.72
Are rule followers at a disadvantage?

1060
01:34:13.24 --> 01:34:15.24
Okay, so yeah, I was a

1061
01:34:16.12 --> 01:34:18.12
Rebellious youth

1062
01:34:18.92 --> 01:34:21.56
And you know when I got in the suit teams

1063
01:34:21.56 --> 01:34:27.80
I was kind of a rebel rebel rebel as well and as a matter of fact if you think about it from a certain perspective

1064
01:34:28.44 --> 01:34:33.72
Being in special operations, especially when I came in being in special operations is almost the

1065
01:34:33.72 --> 01:34:39.32
Form of rebellion in its own right because you're saying look the regular stuff. We'll do the regular stuff right?

1066
01:34:39.32 --> 01:34:41.32
I'll do the other stuff

1067
01:34:41.88 --> 01:34:43.88
so

1068
01:34:43.96 --> 01:34:47.56
That was my attitude. You know, I thought all regular navy now

1069
01:34:48.36 --> 01:34:53.40
I'm doing this you know, so that was my rebellion and and and like I've explained before

1070
01:34:53.80 --> 01:34:59.40
Joining the military I grew up in in New England not a lot of not a huge military proponent up there

1071
01:34:59.40 --> 01:35:06.36
And so that was it was almost rebellious thing and matter of fact it wasn't rebellious thing for me to join the military in the first place

1072
01:35:06.36 --> 01:35:08.12
So these are the kind of things that were

1073
01:35:08.68 --> 01:35:12.92
rebellious and yes, we were we were my buddies and me were

1074
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:15.16
Rebellious with some rebellious

1075
01:35:16.60 --> 01:35:18.60
Rock and roll bands back in the day

1076
01:35:19.80 --> 01:35:21.80
so

1077
01:35:22.28 --> 01:35:25.32
When I got to the seal teams we actually were

1078
01:35:25.32 --> 01:35:29.08
I kind of maintained that you know like we're gonna be hardcore me

1079
01:35:29.80 --> 01:35:35.24
Maybe there wasn't rebel, but we were we were like outsiders, you know, we were like going hard and

1080
01:35:35.96 --> 01:35:42.04
The group of guys I was with when the guys I went through seal training with and went to seal team one with me back in the day

1081
01:35:45.16 --> 01:35:49.16
You know, we we were getting effort we were pushing hard we were

1082
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:55.80
You know being hardcore and I actually got told to stand down a few times for doing stuff that was

1083
01:35:57.16 --> 01:35:59.16
a little bit too hard core

1084
01:35:59.96 --> 01:36:05.96
And it's a matter of fact so you get these evaluations in the in the navy when I first got in the navy

1085
01:36:06.52 --> 01:36:11.80
They had this old evaluation system where you had 15 things you were getting evaluated on and

1086
01:36:11.80 --> 01:36:18.36
And everybody it it had been um in inflation so high as grade you could get is a 4.0

1087
01:36:19.32 --> 01:36:24.60
So if there was inflation on the grades at the time and so everyone just put 4.0 for everything

1088
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:32.04
Pretty much and I actually I have this I actually saved this evaluation of me, but I got a 3.8

1089
01:36:32.68 --> 01:36:34.04
3.8

1090
01:36:34.04 --> 01:36:37.64
in team building and the guy that gave it to me

1091
01:36:38.76 --> 01:36:39.72
said

1092
01:36:39.72 --> 01:36:43.72
You know you're just you're just too hard on people that are unsat

1093
01:36:46.76 --> 01:36:51.64
Which I actually he was one of the guys that I was like you know hard on yeah, I was hard on

1094
01:36:51.64 --> 01:36:52.76
Never-for-for-for

1095
01:36:52.76 --> 01:36:58.04
So and unsat I used to use that word all the time yeah sat around ceremony that these

1096
01:36:58.04 --> 01:37:01.40
Yeah, so that was sort of you know we were we were

1097
01:37:01.40 --> 01:37:05.72
Rebelling by being super hardcore I guess you could say but then

1098
01:37:05.72 --> 01:37:12.68
Even though I was rebellious and again that's a strong word I don't know if that's the word we were

1099
01:37:13.56 --> 01:37:15.56
It's I don't know if that's the perfect word

1100
01:37:16.20 --> 01:37:21.72
But I did I love the seal teams right so and and in working for some of the great guys that I work for I

1101
01:37:21.72 --> 01:37:26.84
Realize that if you want to impact the teams which I want to do because I did love teams

1102
01:37:26.84 --> 01:37:29.56
Then you got to try again to some kind of leadership position you know

1103
01:37:30.20 --> 01:37:34.60
These guys that I respected that I worked for so did wait that guy controls this platoon

1104
01:37:34.60 --> 01:37:38.36
I want to do that he's helping us he's making that's good so

1105
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:41.16
Can like that old quote that

1106
01:37:42.44 --> 01:37:50.20
The best former revenge is success it's almost like the best form of rebellion is success and so

1107
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:57.96
That's what I kind of went for to a situation. I was trying to first situation where I could move forward and kind of bring this hey

1108
01:37:58.36 --> 01:38:00.60
I got this now this my platoon

1109
01:38:00.60 --> 01:38:02.92
You know so I I guess that was a little bit of a

1110
01:38:02.92 --> 01:38:05.56
There's a little bit simplified but but

1111
01:38:06.68 --> 01:38:10.20
You know I don't want again. I don't want to make it sound like I was some kind of crazy rebel in the seal teams

1112
01:38:10.20 --> 01:38:12.20
I wasn't I was I was

1113
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.04
Into the seal teams I was into doing the right thing and and

1114
01:38:17.16 --> 01:38:18.68
I wanted to

1115
01:38:18.68 --> 01:38:22.20
Do the do my best in the seal team so I guess that's not really being rebellious at all

1116
01:38:22.52 --> 01:38:29.48
But I did still have some of that rebel mindset and one of the things I think is beneficial about having a rebel mindset is

1117
01:38:29.48 --> 01:38:37.24
You question things right you question things you're not allowed to you're I was never afraid to say no or I don't agree with that

1118
01:38:37.24 --> 01:38:39.32
I was never afraid to be contrarian or something

1119
01:38:39.32 --> 01:38:46.04
I was never afraid to hold the line and take criticism so that goes even if if you're in a group of rebels

1120
01:38:47.48 --> 01:38:49.72
And you go against them who's the rebel now?

1121
01:38:50.52 --> 01:38:55.64
Well you are so when guys were beyond out of certain path I would I'd be okay

1122
01:38:55.64 --> 01:38:57.16
Hold in the line against them because

1123
01:38:57.16 --> 01:39:02.28
I was okay with being an outsider. I guess that's the word I've been looking for like an outsider

1124
01:39:02.28 --> 01:39:03.80
Someone's not quite

1125
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:09.08
Just following and and doing whatever and also doing I've always been okay with being an outsider

1126
01:39:09.08 --> 01:39:11.08
So maybe it's not necessarily a rebel

1127
01:39:12.12 --> 01:39:18.84
But being an outsider and like okay those guys are doing it that way. No, I don't agree with that and I'm okay being over here by myself

1128
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:25.56
Marching to my own drum for lack of a better word. It's kind of like only if you need to be kind of thing

1129
01:39:25.56 --> 01:39:27.56
Right

1130
01:39:27.56 --> 01:39:32.12
What do you mean like if everyone's doing the right thing you're gonna do with that sure and you're gonna you know go hard

1131
01:39:32.44 --> 01:39:38.60
You know the way you do but yeah, you're not just like this follow the following line, you know and I never

1132
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.28
I would say that's something and so if we categorize that as

1133
01:39:42.84 --> 01:39:49.96
Being rebellious then yes, I kind of I would more categorize it with being comfortable with being an outsider

1134
01:39:50.28 --> 01:39:51.08
Yeah

1135
01:39:51.08 --> 01:39:57.16
comfortable with my own decision making process so and not always I mean there's times where I did things

1136
01:39:57.16 --> 01:40:00.60
It was you know I was younger you're not that's another thing when um

1137
01:40:02.28 --> 01:40:09.08
You know you hear me talk on 44 years old right I spent my whole adult life in the sealed teams

1138
01:40:09.08 --> 01:40:14.84
I didn't show up in the sealed teams with like this incredible leadership capability

1139
01:40:14.84 --> 01:40:21.48
I learned this stuff. I'm learning still learning I'm still learning this stuff. I picked up off along the way

1140
01:40:21.48 --> 01:40:27.32
So I don't want people to ever think that you know I was a superstar

1141
01:40:28.68 --> 01:40:33.48
Yeah, wasn't you know, I'm still not I'm just I have an open mind

1142
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:40.28
But now I can look back yeah, and I was lucky enough to have some great jobs and some great experiences that opened a lot of

1143
01:40:40.28 --> 01:40:42.28
I

1144
01:40:42.28 --> 01:40:49.72
It showed me it. I learned a lot. I had an open mind and the world taught me a lot stuff and so

1145
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.20
Yeah, but it wasn't wasn't just like hey, I was

1146
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Showed up there but I

1147
01:40:57.40 --> 01:41:00.44
Would say this the lead people that are out there that are leaders

1148
01:41:01.48 --> 01:41:06.84
Keep the level alive keep alive keep under control

1149
01:41:06.84 --> 01:41:11.48
Yeah, and maybe you don't let the rebel talk to other people

1150
01:41:12.36 --> 01:41:13.32
Right?

1151
01:41:13.32 --> 01:41:20.68
Maybe and I've had a seal buddies that do this where there there rebellious is there as outsider or whatever the word we're using as I am

1152
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.24
But they just can't keep it inside so they're verbalizing it and they're and what are they doing they're making enemies?

1153
01:41:26.28 --> 01:41:28.28
They're making

1154
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:30.04
They're they're antagonizing people

1155
01:41:30.04 --> 01:41:33.08
They're doing that. I never did that because I'm playing the game

1156
01:41:33.08 --> 01:41:37.48
I'm gonna win the long term strategic goal so don't let the rebel

1157
01:41:38.52 --> 01:41:39.80
Be the one that

1158
01:41:39.80 --> 01:41:41.80
Represents you and talks and open your mouth

1159
01:41:42.52 --> 01:41:43.80
But

1160
01:41:43.80 --> 01:41:45.80
Let him whisper in your ear

1161
01:41:45.80 --> 01:41:47.80
In listen

1162
01:41:47.80 --> 01:41:51.80
Yeah, I talked about it. I talked to my wife a lot about the difference

1163
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.64
There's the difference between what you think or what you feel or whatever and what how you behave

1164
01:41:57.96 --> 01:41:59.72
So like you can

1165
01:41:59.72 --> 01:42:03.40
If you I don't know you get cut off in traffic or something

1166
01:42:05.72 --> 01:42:09.56
No one's gonna be mad at you if you're like mad at that or that irritates you or whatever

1167
01:42:09.88 --> 01:42:16.12
But if you start flipping the guy off or or violating traffic logical chase somewhere do you know start behaving

1168
01:42:16.68 --> 01:42:22.28
Because he cut you behaving in a certain way then that's wrong. So there's a difference you can feel like all kinds of stuff

1169
01:42:23.40 --> 01:42:27.08
But once you start misbehaving that's when the violations come up

1170
01:42:27.08 --> 01:42:33.72
Yeah, basically what you're saying. I don't don't let him control your judge yourself. Yeah, you're behavior mind control

1171
01:42:38.60 --> 01:42:41.64
Yeah, they're like just being a rebel typically that's like

1172
01:42:42.20 --> 01:42:46.68
Hey, all these rules that everyone's following. I'm gonna. I rebel against those rules

1173
01:42:46.68 --> 01:42:50.68
But here's the thing some of those rules are good rules exactly so you can't just be a rebel to

1174
01:42:50.68 --> 01:42:56.60
Unable Lincoln statement. Yeah, I'm a rebel and that's why that's why it was kind of pulling back on that word

1175
01:42:56.60 --> 01:43:02.92
Yeah, it makes me sound like I was big rebel. I was not I was I I loved being in the teams

1176
01:43:04.12 --> 01:43:10.12
So why would I rebel against it? Yeah the people I rebel against were the guys that were not good seals

1177
01:43:10.92 --> 01:43:14.84
We were about against them like I told you we had a mupe that was a rebellion

1178
01:43:14.84 --> 01:43:20.92
That was a straight rebellion. Yeah, how to real legit mutiny and when against our cleaning are our platoon commander

1179
01:43:20.92 --> 01:43:27.88
Mm-hmm and said hey to this commanding officer said no, I don't want this guy anymore. That's that's a rebel. Yeah, we were about but then again

1180
01:43:28.28 --> 01:43:31.40
Everyone in my platoon was with me so we all were about so then was I a rebel?

1181
01:43:31.40 --> 01:43:35.56
I don't know yeah, and does that make you a rebel just because you rebel don't on time

1182
01:43:36.44 --> 01:43:38.20
You know yeah

1183
01:43:38.20 --> 01:43:42.68
I get think we didn't see much semantics or a hundred and a semantics kind of part of

1184
01:43:44.04 --> 01:43:46.76
Let's not go there. All right next question

1185
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:55.24
Question jockel how do you deal with the leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership?

1186
01:43:56.12 --> 01:43:58.12
Oh, dream

1187
01:43:58.52 --> 01:44:03.96
The leader who preaches ownership but does not practice ownership you know what I do in those situations

1188
01:44:04.28 --> 01:44:08.76
I take ownership myself and I work for all kinds of bosses

1189
01:44:09.48 --> 01:44:11.96
That didn't want to take ownership and you know what I did

1190
01:44:11.96 --> 01:44:18.12
Take ownership. I took ownership. Do you work for a boss that doesn't want to lead you know what I did?

1191
01:44:19.08 --> 01:44:21.08
Lead

1192
01:44:21.64 --> 01:44:23.40
If

1193
01:44:23.40 --> 01:44:27.88
For in my mind if a boss doesn't step up or doesn't take ownership they're not a

1194
01:44:28.60 --> 01:44:30.60
problem

1195
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
They're an opportunity

1196
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.04
They're an opportunity to an opportunity for me to step up if you're not if you're my leader and you're not giving me instruction

1197
01:44:38.04 --> 01:44:42.12
You're not stepping up and leaving guess what I'm gonna run with it. I'm gonna run

1198
01:44:42.12 --> 01:44:45.24
I'm gonna take control. I'm gonna take command. I'm gonna make things happen and

1199
01:44:46.12 --> 01:44:48.12
You're either gonna

1200
01:44:48.12 --> 01:44:54.04
You're either gonna see what I'm doing and say wow he's taking ownership. I need to step up or

1201
01:44:56.20 --> 01:44:58.20
If he doesn't have any potential at all

1202
01:44:59.24 --> 01:45:01.24
then maybe he looks at it and says

1203
01:45:03.80 --> 01:45:07.88
You know what I'm maybe I'm not fit for this or maybe they don't realize it's happening

1204
01:45:07.88 --> 01:45:11.56
You'll not take it their job from them because other people will eventually realize

1205
01:45:12.84 --> 01:45:15.24
Now the thing that you have to be careful of

1206
01:45:16.84 --> 01:45:20.04
Is if you say oh he's not leading I'm gonna lead

1207
01:45:20.68 --> 01:45:26.76
That your ego starts saying I'm gonna lead her and then you flaunt it and now you might make your boss think that you're

1208
01:45:26.76 --> 01:45:28.76
Gunning for their job

1209
01:45:28.76 --> 01:45:30.28
Hmm

1210
01:45:30.28 --> 01:45:33.40
And then we can have some issues because now we might shut you down

1211
01:45:33.40 --> 01:45:38.68
You know there's all kinds of things that negative things that can happen there so when you take ownership

1212
01:45:38.68 --> 01:45:41.80
You gotta make sure you're putting your ego in check and make sure that you're taking ownership

1213
01:45:41.80 --> 01:45:45.000
But you're still giving them the credit that's the hardest thing to do but it works

1214
01:45:45.32 --> 01:45:49.48
I'm telling you I promise you that works if you take ownership, but then you give them the credit like

1215
01:45:49.48 --> 01:45:52.92
Hey sir, you know, I just want to go through this thing right here. Here's what I did yesterday

1216
01:45:53.40 --> 01:45:58.20
Based on you know the guidance that you gave us the guidance giving you guidance. Please make it up

1217
01:45:59.64 --> 01:46:01.64
Just make it up

1218
01:46:01.64 --> 01:46:06.52
These you know here we go and you just do your best to make him look good

1219
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.40
Eventually you're gonna win so if you got some of that's not leading that's not stepping up. That's not taking ownership

1220
01:46:11.40 --> 01:46:13.40
Just do it yourself

1221
01:46:13.40 --> 01:46:15.40
Do it in a tactful manner

1222
01:46:15.80 --> 01:46:17.56
Do it in a

1223
01:46:17.56 --> 01:46:20.04
non-ego flare-up manner

1224
01:46:21.24 --> 01:46:23.24
But do it make it happen

1225
01:46:23.24 --> 01:46:25.24
Get after

1226
01:46:25.24 --> 01:46:29.40
Yeah, if you keep that goal in a hall like when you're on a team right you have a

1227
01:46:29.40 --> 01:46:35.24
Some objectives and it's probably just just a handful of them typically if not just one close with the destroy the enemy

1228
01:46:35.24 --> 01:46:42.52
Yep, yeah, make the ceiling you know, whatever the goal is if you keep the goal in mine then you as long as you like really keep it in mine

1229
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.96
You you can avoid all the because if you're like okay

1230
01:46:45.96 --> 01:46:53.24
I'm gonna step up just like I already say I'm gonna step up and lead and then if you're goal shifts from the main goal that you guys all have to

1231
01:46:53.96 --> 01:46:57.56
Now my new goal is to be the leader that's my goal to be the leader then

1232
01:46:57.56 --> 01:46:59.56
Out comes the ego because

1233
01:47:00.68 --> 01:47:05.56
The being the leader that's what your focus on. I'm the leader of the follow-up kind of thing

1234
01:47:06.12 --> 01:47:09.48
Keep the goal in mine you're gonna do basically with your ownership

1235
01:47:09.48 --> 01:47:13.96
You're gonna do your part and then some if someone's not doing you know certain things or whatever

1236
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:19.72
You're gonna take the lead you're gonna do your job in it to achieve the goal therefore pulling everybody ahead

1237
01:47:20.84 --> 01:47:26.60
So we're gonna keep that keep that goal in mine there. Yes indeed do it for the goal not for yourself

1238
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:28.60
Yeah

1239
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.60
Good

1240
01:47:30.60 --> 01:47:32.60
Jockel

1241
01:47:32.76 --> 01:47:39.88
Something I would be very interested in listening to you discuss is the art of disarming people with words

1242
01:47:42.52 --> 01:47:48.76
Yeah, and good question. How do we how do we disarm people and

1243
01:47:50.60 --> 01:47:55.56
Good thing tonight. We talked about maneuver warfare because we already know that we're not gonna attack the strong point

1244
01:47:55.56 --> 01:47:59.40
We're gonna look for the gaps. We're gonna look for the weaknesses. We're gonna look for the openings

1245
01:47:59.72 --> 01:48:03.80
So what does that mean that means if we're dealing with someone that has a big ego

1246
01:48:04.36 --> 01:48:09.16
We're gonna side step that we might even throw some compliments out there might be saying echo

1247
01:48:09.32 --> 01:48:15.000
You're so good at doing this right here. I could use some help doing that now we're getting around as ego

1248
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.04
Now we can start getting into his head if the person's over aggressive

1249
01:48:18.04 --> 01:48:22.76
Maybe you just have to be a little bit more accepting of them. Maybe if they're nervous you got to just reassure them

1250
01:48:22.76 --> 01:48:24.76
They're hostile

1251
01:48:24.76 --> 01:48:33.08
Be just be open-minded to what they're saying so there's a lot of ways that disarm and impact some tactical things that you could literally like

1252
01:48:33.64 --> 01:48:34.68
It says

1253
01:48:34.68 --> 01:48:38.68
Disarm people with words, so what are words that disarm people? I'll give you a couple

1254
01:48:39.56 --> 01:48:41.56
That's a good idea

1255
01:48:41.56 --> 01:48:49.16
Oh, okay, or yeah, that actually makes good that that's good sense right there. That makes sense right? Disarmed or

1256
01:48:49.16 --> 01:48:56.04
Oh, yeah, I like that disarmed right all free those little easy phrase. That's a good idea that makes sense

1257
01:48:56.36 --> 01:49:00.60
You know, I like that those are all things that are gonna disarm somebody a little bit and

1258
01:49:02.84 --> 01:49:05.56
Once you disarm them they're gonna they're gonna

1259
01:49:06.92 --> 01:49:09.72
Open up they're gonna open up a little bit so so like

1260
01:49:12.04 --> 01:49:14.04
Once you

1261
01:49:14.04 --> 01:49:20.28
You're gonna have you once you get them disarmed by just opening your mind given a little compliment

1262
01:49:20.28 --> 01:49:26.28
Tell them that you like whether they're coming with coming from and then you start to probe and trying to figure out what's going on

1263
01:49:26.28 --> 01:49:30.68
And instead of being direct right we want to use the indirect method here so

1264
01:49:31.24 --> 01:49:33.24
You know ask questions

1265
01:49:34.20 --> 01:49:38.28
Say hey echo could you explain to me what what the what we're trying to get done here?

1266
01:49:38.28 --> 01:49:42.92
That's a lot different than what are you trying to do here?

1267
01:49:43.32 --> 01:49:49.88
That's an attack almost what the hell are you thinking what the hell were you thinking hey could you explain to me this because I'm not sure I understood

1268
01:49:49.88 --> 01:49:51.88
I didn't really see everything here or

1269
01:49:52.60 --> 01:49:54.20
Hey, I'm having trouble

1270
01:49:54.36 --> 01:49:58.36
Understanding this can you can you help me because I'm not sure I don't think I get this

1271
01:49:59.16 --> 01:50:05.32
So now when I say that to you you in order to explain something you have to actually open up you have to say okay

1272
01:50:05.32 --> 01:50:10.28
I'll find I'll tell you well as soon as you say that now you're open up right now you're open up and when you open yourself up

1273
01:50:11.08 --> 01:50:13.08
When you open yourself up verbally

1274
01:50:13.80 --> 01:50:18.60
With an idea to explain an idea that you're open yourself up mentally too because now we're having a discussion

1275
01:50:19.64 --> 01:50:22.12
Make happen so it's pretty easy

1276
01:50:23.64 --> 01:50:27.40
I shouldn't say it's pretty easy if you think about it and you just think about

1277
01:50:28.12 --> 01:50:29.64
those simple

1278
01:50:29.64 --> 01:50:37.40
Frases that you can use to disarm people. Hey, it's good idea. I like where you're coming from all the other that that that actually that makes good sense or

1279
01:50:38.84 --> 01:50:43.56
That is the way you disarm somebody very simple. Yeah, and there's little things you can do

1280
01:50:44.52 --> 01:50:50.92
even outside actually outside straight up outside of any specific like scenario

1281
01:50:51.64 --> 01:50:57.48
Where you know some people are just more approachable than other people and then some some people just just aren't

1282
01:50:57.48 --> 01:50:59.48
So what you can do

1283
01:50:59.48 --> 01:51:02.76
And what I've noticed is people that don't talk

1284
01:51:04.44 --> 01:51:08.92
Negatively about people and don't come in just talking negative in general like I knew a guy

1285
01:51:08.92 --> 01:51:15.64
No, I still know him, but I don't see him anymore hardly but every time he'd come in the first thing out of his mouth was something like

1286
01:51:15.64 --> 01:51:21.72
I don't know traffic was bad. It was something bad. You know, he was just complaining about life and it was just a matter of

1287
01:51:22.12 --> 01:51:26.28
What particular thing he chose to complain about, but it was always a complaint everything and

1288
01:51:26.28 --> 01:51:31.48
And another thing he would do is let's say someone would say something. Oh, hey, did you see this or that or whatever?

1289
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:36.60
This was real cool. He'd be like yeah, but and then say something bad and kind of dump on it, you know

1290
01:51:36.60 --> 01:51:38.68
Yeah, that's true, but you know that kind of stuff. So

1291
01:51:39.48 --> 01:51:43.40
Don't do that so that seems kind of easy, but you'd be surprised where

1292
01:51:44.04 --> 01:51:47.96
Don't be super negative. Yes, don't be don't be a negative person in general

1293
01:51:48.36 --> 01:51:51.72
So right off the bat you'll be kind of one of those guys that's more approachable

1294
01:51:51.88 --> 01:51:53.88
But here's here's one that's harder

1295
01:51:53.88 --> 01:51:58.68
I mean it's simple, but it's it's kind of harder to do because I think it comes kind of natural

1296
01:51:58.68 --> 01:52:02.60
Easy so not easy is don't talk bad about people and

1297
01:52:03.24 --> 01:52:10.28
When people are talking bad about people like to you or around you or whatever don't like jump in and kind of accommodate them

1298
01:52:10.68 --> 01:52:12.28
And I'm not saying

1299
01:52:12.28 --> 01:52:19.000
Reject them or even talk bad about them talking bad about people don't don't do that just don't be one of those people. Yeah, it's the here's the thing it's

1300
01:52:20.12 --> 01:52:22.12
I'm going above and beyond saying

1301
01:52:22.12 --> 01:52:24.12
Don't

1302
01:52:24.12 --> 01:52:28.84
Be you know certain people that's all they do is gospel about people of course. That's a no brainer

1303
01:52:28.84 --> 01:52:36.68
I'm saying never do it try to never do it at any cost never do it if you can because basically you're trying to establish a rep

1304
01:52:37.24 --> 01:52:41.32
Of being this positive approachable person that's what you're trying to do

1305
01:52:41.56 --> 01:52:44.04
So even though people don't take

1306
01:52:44.28 --> 01:52:48.44
Specific mental notes like oh you're talking bad about this person you always talk bad about people

1307
01:52:48.44 --> 01:52:52.76
They feel it so you ever you ever been around somebody who tells

1308
01:52:53.40 --> 01:52:59.000
Tells you secrets every time they see you like am not supposed to tell you this but this and you're like dang this guy's telling me

1309
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.96
You know this cool secrets. I like being around him and not typically white people tell and I'm never gonna tell them in a secret

1310
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:06.20
That's exactly right so you know

1311
01:53:06.20 --> 01:53:10.28
This guy's talking about about people or this guy's being negative or whatever when it comes to you

1312
01:53:10.28 --> 01:53:15.72
Why why would I want to trust in this guy or talk to this guy about this? Especially for gonna do something together

1313
01:53:15.72 --> 01:53:21.80
You know, so you're kind of coming at it from the other perspective not how would you disarm someone you're just coming at it from how do you

1314
01:53:22.12 --> 01:53:27.64
Be a person that doesn't even need to be disarmed. Yeah, like just yeah exactly so you're so just so

1315
01:53:28.76 --> 01:53:37.68
At the start point. No, no, you're actually right so you're saying if if I know you as a guy that doesn't talk bad and doesn't tell secrets and doesn't

1316
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:39.88
But then I'm gonna automatically be a little bit

1317
01:53:39.88 --> 01:53:41.88
You're gonna start off a little bit

1318
01:53:41.88 --> 01:53:49.82
So you've developed a relationship with the person. Yeah, with that won't really make that your goal make that your goal. Yeah

1319
01:53:54.84 --> 01:54:01.94
Jocco have you worked with anyone who led from an emotional or unbalanced place

1320
01:54:02.28 --> 01:54:04.28
But learn to detach

1321
01:54:05.56 --> 01:54:07.56
And what help them

1322
01:54:07.56 --> 01:54:13.88
Well when I was putting these questions together obviously here's one where you also have to use a little

1323
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:22.08
Disarm movement to get someone that's getting emotional about something you gotta get them to calm down. Yeah, so you don't reciprocate the emotion

1324
01:54:23.16 --> 01:54:26.52
Don't coach people when they're angry or emotional

1325
01:54:26.52 --> 01:54:29.56
That's not the time to say hey, you know what you need to do right now is you need to calm down

1326
01:54:29.56 --> 01:54:32.92
Yeah, you know that that does doesn't work actually

1327
01:54:32.92 --> 01:54:42.14
Life was telling that story on the last podcast where he was using losing his temper about something and I just you know stood there and said kind of smiled and said

1328
01:54:43.36 --> 01:54:49.42
I didn't I didn't reciprocate the anchor. I said hey take it easy. You know don't worry about it

1329
01:54:49.42 --> 01:54:55.48
Let's just think about it. Can you make this happen and he's like yeah, I can of course. I actually I had a

1330
01:54:56.40 --> 01:55:02.000
One of my one of my senior and listed advisors actually my first deployment to Iraq and

1331
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.88
And and he and I were old school team one guy send up

1332
01:55:08.16 --> 01:55:14.66
What one of my one of my favorite guys in the world actually, but he would sometimes get a little bit

1333
01:55:14.66 --> 01:55:17.000
Most of a little bit a little bit

1334
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.74
He had this tactic that I picked up from him that I that I understood the way he

1335
01:55:22.56 --> 01:55:24.56
the way he addressed

1336
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:27.04
conflict

1337
01:55:27.04 --> 01:55:31.92
Was and I broke it down form eventually was simplify and

1338
01:55:32.12 --> 01:55:39.54
Profi and repeat that's what he would do and it actually worked and worked a lot of time on most people and so like first if I said

1339
01:55:40.56 --> 01:55:42.56
Hey

1340
01:55:42.56 --> 01:55:47.90
I'm gonna need it. I want to take a couple more guys on this operation and if he didn't think I needed more guys for an operation

1341
01:55:48.24 --> 01:55:52.60
He'd say well, why don't you just take everyone in the compound? I'll tell you what just take every person on the roster

1342
01:55:52.60 --> 01:55:57.16
We'll give you that'll give you enough people then we'll take everyone. I'll also rounding everyone up right now

1343
01:55:57.16 --> 01:56:01.32
We'll take every single person that we have out there and I'll even grab some army guys on the web

1344
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:05.92
That was his way and and and I'll be like no man

1345
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:11.96
No and but I wouldn't do is I wouldn't get defensive. I wouldn't get fired up and I would say

1346
01:56:12.68 --> 01:56:15.40
Hey, no, I'm not saying any of everybody

1347
01:56:15.40 --> 01:56:20.000
I'm just saying I want to take a three more guys there's some spaces in the vehicles that will give us a little more

1348
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.16
Ability to contain the target and we look at that say look take a look at the map. We can and so then he

1349
01:56:27.44 --> 01:56:28.64
Calm down

1350
01:56:28.64 --> 01:56:35.02
I mean and in this guy's case he actually wasn't like two emotional. He was just super passionate and when I actually broke down the

1351
01:56:35.80 --> 01:56:38.000
simplify amplifying and intensify

1352
01:56:39.76 --> 01:56:44.52
Oh no, it was simplified amplifying repeat. That's what you do. Simplify amplifying repeat

1353
01:56:44.52 --> 01:56:50.32
When and then when when every we would start getting a discussion and he would start doing it. We would start laughing because

1354
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.66
He realized it has exactly what he was doing so the simple by amplifier repeat. That's that's what the name you put on his little

1355
01:56:56.66 --> 01:56:58.66
That was his methodology

1356
01:56:58.66 --> 01:57:02.24
Yeah, you know if you said like I said if I said I had need a couple more guys

1357
01:57:02.24 --> 01:57:05.24
You take will just take everyone then if that's what you need every single guy

1358
01:57:05.24 --> 01:57:10.72
You're he would simplify what you said he would amplify it and make it more extreme and he would just repeat it

1359
01:57:10.72 --> 01:57:17.84
Yeah, and most people that he did it to they would feel stupid because of what he did to him

1360
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:22.000
You know he said well, no, I don't need no, I just feel stupid and he said so just

1361
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:24.40
Ridiculous and he'd win

1362
01:57:26.32 --> 01:57:33.64
But we had we we would laugh about it, but but like I said he wasn't actually too emotional

1363
01:57:35.96 --> 01:57:39.60
He was just fired up about stuff which is a positive thing

1364
01:57:39.60 --> 01:57:45.98
But someone that is actually too emotional so like I said you got to stay calm you don't

1365
01:57:46.72 --> 01:57:55.52
Don't coach people when they're angry you set a good example and then when people come down later you talk to them about

1366
01:57:56.64 --> 01:58:02.84
Like came in that wasn't cool and you got to you got to spin it right because you're trying to get you're trying to you

1367
01:58:02.84 --> 01:58:04.84
Don't want to like literally coach

1368
01:58:04.84 --> 01:58:09.48
Because if I say echo I need to coach you as I'm in your defensive and all that but if I say

1369
01:58:10.48 --> 01:58:12.48
Hey man, I

1370
01:58:12.48 --> 01:58:18.80
Man, I rely on you because of your expertise and I think you're the only guy in the pool tune that can actually make this happen

1371
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:24.28
So if you're losing your temper man that doesn't all of a sudden I can't count on you and I need you

1372
01:58:25.40 --> 01:58:28.40
Because you know make good I mean we none of us make good decisions if we're all

1373
01:58:28.76 --> 01:58:30.76
Ben out of shape on something

1374
01:58:30.76 --> 01:58:38.44
So I got to please can you just can you help me by just hey man if you start if you start getting angry about something

1375
01:58:38.44 --> 01:58:42.52
Just realize it's gonna affect your decision making and we can't have that man

1376
01:58:42.52 --> 01:58:46.80
We need to come we need to make the good decisions people are count on us and that's

1377
01:58:47.76 --> 01:58:49.16
How I'm

1378
01:58:49.16 --> 01:58:54.84
Handling someone that gets emotional about stuff. Yeah, that that's what it's some simplify repeat one

1379
01:58:55.12 --> 01:58:57.40
But I can simplify

1380
01:58:57.40 --> 01:59:03.76
Every I'm not gonna say all girls do this but some wives might feel like you say

1381
01:59:03.76 --> 01:59:05.76
Lives with the last name Charles

1382
01:59:07.32 --> 01:59:09.32
You know

1383
01:59:09.32 --> 01:59:14.28
Ultimately I think if you know and you're if you're in a good really you don't really take it that seriously

1384
01:59:14.28 --> 01:59:20.38
But but yeah, you say like I don't know you know hey you you were you said something mean to me or whatever

1385
01:59:20.38 --> 01:59:25.60
No, we'll then why do marry me then why don't you just you know you they take it to the to that next level

1386
01:59:25.60 --> 01:59:30.56
I am provide repeat. Oh, yeah, or watch out for that. We're hey go to this one time long time

1387
01:59:30.56 --> 01:59:31.56
We were first cut

1388
01:59:31.56 --> 01:59:33.56
She's a she said

1389
01:59:33.88 --> 01:59:38.84
She won me to get orange juice. I went to the store's going to start wanting me to get orange juice for whatever reason

1390
01:59:38.84 --> 01:59:43.20
I forgot the orange juice. I didn't choose not to get orange juice forgot just forgot

1391
01:59:45.32 --> 01:59:49.000
You know you come home for get the orange juice. She said something along the lines of

1392
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.92
Does anything I say have any importance to you at all?

1393
01:59:53.92 --> 01:59:56.32
That's that's what that is right

1394
01:59:56.32 --> 02:00:01.20
I provide and all she needs to do is say it more than once and you got the repeat as well

1395
02:00:01.20 --> 02:00:07.04
Yeah, yeah, so I mean I guess to answer that question. No. Yeah, most things are pretty important

1396
02:00:07.04 --> 02:00:11.36
I mean maybe not the orange juice at that moment. You know I forgot

1397
02:00:12.80 --> 02:00:18.06
Another tactic like when you talk to people like to calm them down or whatever like let's say something they lose their temporal

1398
02:00:18.06 --> 02:00:24.46
The camera something like that and you have to address like them losing their tempered be like hey, you know how you use the word passionate passionate

1399
02:00:24.46 --> 02:00:29.66
Is it basically like an excuse word for someone being like you know people like it's a fashion in

1400
02:00:29.66 --> 02:00:32.66
Compassionate you can be it can be you can be you

1401
02:00:32.66 --> 02:00:38.70
Well here's the thing being passionate and being emotional are two different things because you can be passionate about something

1402
02:00:38.70 --> 02:00:41.14
And not lose your temper and not being in one of their two different things

1403
02:00:41.22 --> 02:00:44.46
So people will be like they'll put that on and so it sounds kind of acceptable

1404
02:00:44.46 --> 02:00:49.14
Simply not true, but so if you if the but you can use that to your advantage

1405
02:00:49.14 --> 02:00:53.90
You can be like hey, I know you're passionate. I dig it man. It's one of the things I like about you

1406
02:00:54.54 --> 02:00:58.44
And another thing that I like about you is that you're also a thinker

1407
02:00:58.82 --> 02:01:01.46
That's why oh, and you say what to do

1408
02:01:01.46 --> 02:01:03.14
That's what you go work there

1409
02:01:03.78 --> 02:01:04.78
Ninja mine

1410
02:01:04.78 --> 02:01:11.30
The key line there is that's what I like about you or what I like about you is this and then they kind of take on that role

1411
02:01:11.30 --> 02:01:19.10
For sure, you're disarming them yeah, yeah, yeah, there you go very good very good next question

1412
02:01:20.78 --> 02:01:27.26
Duckle what do you think of the saying you get more bees with honey?

1413
02:01:27.26 --> 02:01:29.26
They actually asked to leave this to but

1414
02:01:31.38 --> 02:01:34.38
You get more bees with honey I

1415
02:01:34.38 --> 02:01:41.26
Was I always I always actually heard you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar

1416
02:01:41.26 --> 02:01:47.66
But to say my idea and it's something I agree with I mean obviously this comes down to the our word relationships and

1417
02:01:48.90 --> 02:01:54.02
Always what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to build the relationship so I'm gonna put out the honey

1418
02:01:54.70 --> 02:02:00.38
You know, I'm gonna put out the honey the carrot is is is preferable to the stick

1419
02:02:00.38 --> 02:02:05.22
Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is another way of saying that the reward the good stuff the

1420
02:02:06.30 --> 02:02:11.58
So so yeah totally that that absolutely works better um now you can

1421
02:02:13.22 --> 02:02:15.22
Give people too much honey

1422
02:02:15.22 --> 02:02:18.22
And now they get type two diabetes

1423
02:02:19.18 --> 02:02:24.82
They get lazy they get out of shape and they don't work anymore, right?

1424
02:02:24.82 --> 02:02:31.30
So you can't you got to do that's that's the that's the dichotomy that you need to balance as leader not being too hard

1425
02:02:31.30 --> 02:02:34.66
But not being too soft not being too aggressive but being aggressive enough

1426
02:02:36.70 --> 02:02:41.34
That's the dichotomy, but the bottom line is you need to treat people well

1427
02:02:41.98 --> 02:02:44.62
That's what you need to do you need to

1428
02:02:45.34 --> 02:02:48.78
Not spoil them but give them respect in

1429
02:02:49.34 --> 02:02:51.34
Build the relationships and

1430
02:02:51.34 --> 02:02:56.50
If you make that your goal when I work with all these different companies

1431
02:02:57.82 --> 02:03:03.90
You know, I'm I'm gonna say listen make your goal with this person that you're having a problem with make your goal to build a relationship

1432
02:03:04.18 --> 02:03:06.18
That make that your goal

1433
02:03:06.70 --> 02:03:12.58
When they say something negative say something positive when they want to blame something on you say yeah

1434
02:03:12.58 --> 02:03:17.26
You're right. It's my fault build a relationship with the person that's gonna strengthen the team

1435
02:03:17.26 --> 02:03:22.46
It's gonna be thousand times infinitely better than having an antagonistic relationship with somebody

1436
02:03:25.30 --> 02:03:27.30
So

1437
02:03:27.30 --> 02:03:29.30
And also

1438
02:03:29.30 --> 02:03:32.10
You know when you're leading with vinegar when you're leading with fear and

1439
02:03:32.98 --> 02:03:38.18
You're leading with your you're beating people with a stick that doesn't not work out good and the long run

1440
02:03:38.18 --> 02:03:42.06
Do you have to have consequences sometimes? Yeah, but

1441
02:03:42.06 --> 02:03:48.98
The team that is following somebody because they want to do their best for that leader is gonna beat the team

1442
02:03:48.98 --> 02:03:51.62
That is doing things only because they're scared of the leader

1443
02:03:51.78 --> 02:03:57.14
Right, yeah, they're trying to avoid the stick that's gonna be where they operate in

1444
02:03:57.14 --> 02:04:01.66
You're gonna operate enough to avoid the sticks. Yeah, cuz really that's the goal to avoid the stick

1445
02:04:01.66 --> 02:04:04.42
There's no honey really above and beyond yeah

1446
02:04:04.42 --> 02:04:06.94
I think you said something very wise in office space

1447
02:04:07.34 --> 02:04:09.34
What is he saying?

1448
02:04:09.34 --> 02:04:14.46
Review he got hypnotized did you watch office space I've watched it a million times so so he gets hypnotized

1449
02:04:14.46 --> 02:04:18.10
All right, so now he tells the truth or he doesn't care you know about things

1450
02:04:18.10 --> 02:04:23.54
So he's like he's real opening on as he goes into his little review which is supposed to be this kind of tense thing and they say

1451
02:04:25.14 --> 02:04:29.98
Like what's up, you know something that I asked some stuff and he's like it's a problem of motivation

1452
02:04:30.58 --> 02:04:35.38
Like we're you know we're not if I get you know all this he's always explained it to and then he's like okay

1453
02:04:35.38 --> 02:04:40.42
If I'm if I'm scared of you know whatever this punishment from my boss whatever no I'm just gonna work hard

1454
02:04:40.42 --> 02:04:43.62
Enough not to get fired and but that's true. That's absolutely true

1455
02:04:44.42 --> 02:04:47.42
So yeah, like these kids who only get scolded, you know

1456
02:04:47.74 --> 02:04:54.22
They don't get like compassion and and compliment and support you know they only get scolded a lot of times

1457
02:04:55.10 --> 02:05:01.74
I mean there's a lot more to it, but a lot of times they're just gonna do the minimum and clearly to not get scolded too far together direction

1458
02:05:01.74 --> 02:05:10.26
We get spoiled you know and the dangerous part about getting giving to like going to front of the direction

1459
02:05:10.26 --> 02:05:15.22
How you put it is you don't prepare them like they wind up when they're on their own

1460
02:05:15.66 --> 02:05:18.98
Like they're not prepared for like like the tough parts

1461
02:05:18.98 --> 02:05:23.38
Yeah, yeah, and there's a lot of good parts in life, man, but those tough parts there there too

1462
02:05:23.38 --> 02:05:25.14
So if you're not prepared for me, you're gonna get jacked

1463
02:05:26.10 --> 02:05:28.10
Relaxing the better term

1464
02:05:28.10 --> 02:05:30.10
You got to correct term actually

1465
02:05:30.10 --> 02:05:32.10
You know I last question

1466
02:05:34.30 --> 02:05:43.58
Juckle great topic for me would be staying committed to life change. I start strong and fade fast into old habits

1467
02:05:44.10 --> 02:05:53.34
Please help I'm gonna have to bring in the little Shakespeare on this one

1468
02:05:53.34 --> 02:06:01.58
Shakespeare between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion

1469
02:06:02.70 --> 02:06:08.90
All the interim is like a fantastic or a hideous dream

1470
02:06:11.26 --> 02:06:13.26
And that's

1471
02:06:13.26 --> 02:06:15.26
Brutus

1472
02:06:15.58 --> 02:06:20.40
From Julius Caesar and Brutus in the play is plotting to kill

1473
02:06:20.40 --> 02:06:22.40
So Caesar

1474
02:06:23.52 --> 02:06:26.32
Someone he was loyal to

1475
02:06:28.24 --> 02:06:33.24
And Shakespeare the master of understanding human nature

1476
02:06:34.56 --> 02:06:37.56
He captures what that feels like

1477
02:06:39.20 --> 02:06:44.08
And here's what these lines mean between the acting of a dreadful thing

1478
02:06:44.32 --> 02:06:46.96
So that's the moment that

1479
02:06:46.96 --> 02:06:51.36
That moment when you're waiting to do something that you don't want to do

1480
02:06:53.44 --> 02:06:59.04
And the first motion, so that's when you actually start doing that thing that you don't want to do

1481
02:07:01.04 --> 02:07:03.04
All the interim

1482
02:07:03.68 --> 02:07:07.52
Now this is all that time all that time in that moment

1483
02:07:08.32 --> 02:07:10.32
While you are waiting to take action

1484
02:07:10.32 --> 02:07:17.44
Is like a fantasma or a hideous dream

1485
02:07:20.24 --> 02:07:22.24
So that moment

1486
02:07:22.72 --> 02:07:27.68
That moment when you're waiting to do something it's like an apparition a

1487
02:07:28.80 --> 02:07:30.80
hideous dream a nightmare

1488
02:07:33.36 --> 02:07:36.08
And so the battle this struggle

1489
02:07:36.08 --> 02:07:40.08
It takes place in that moment

1490
02:07:43.20 --> 02:07:45.20
It's not

1491
02:07:45.44 --> 02:07:50.000
Knowing what to do that's not the battle. It's not actually doing it

1492
02:07:51.20 --> 02:07:54.000
That's not the battle. It's the moment in between

1493
02:07:55.44 --> 02:07:57.44
It's the hesitation

1494
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:00.80
hesitation is the enemy

1495
02:08:00.80 --> 02:08:04.80
and in war

1496
02:08:07.04 --> 02:08:11.28
Understanding where the enemy is allows you to defeat him

1497
02:08:13.84 --> 02:08:16.64
And this is where the enemy of action

1498
02:08:17.44 --> 02:08:25.44
The enemy of commitment the enemy of change that's where the enemy lies in the waiting

1499
02:08:25.44 --> 02:08:27.44
and

1500
02:08:30.56 --> 02:08:33.36
And all you have to do to win

1501
02:08:34.40 --> 02:08:38.40
is overcome that moment the waiting the hesitation

1502
02:08:40.48 --> 02:08:42.88
All you have to do is go

1503
02:08:44.48 --> 02:08:46.000
Move

1504
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.76
Take action

1505
02:08:47.76 --> 02:08:50.88
Get out of bed get your feet on the ground

1506
02:08:50.88 --> 02:08:55.60
Step into the gym put down the donut and pick up the kettlebell

1507
02:08:58.80 --> 02:09:02.80
Do not hesitate do not wait go forward

1508
02:09:04.32 --> 02:09:06.32
Go to war

1509
02:09:07.36 --> 02:09:09.36
And win

1510
02:09:11.92 --> 02:09:13.92
Every

1511
02:09:13.92 --> 02:09:15.92
single

1512
02:09:15.92 --> 02:09:17.92
All right

1513
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And I think that's

1514
02:09:23.12 --> 02:09:25.12
All of got for the night

1515
02:09:27.20 --> 02:09:30.72
Thanks to everybody out there for listening and for all the

1516
02:09:32.80 --> 02:09:37.12
Awesome continued support or get from everybody if you want to keep supporting

1517
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Echo how they do that

1518
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:43.68
Well, primarily

1519
02:09:43.68 --> 02:09:45.68
I

1520
02:09:45.68 --> 02:09:47.84
Would say support yourself with supplementation

1521
02:09:48.56 --> 02:09:53.28
Because really that's really what it's about not necessarily does supplementation but supporting yourself as well

1522
02:09:53.28 --> 02:09:56.80
It's kind of like when you when you fly in the airplane

1523
02:09:57.20 --> 02:10:02.56
Yeah, you know you got to put the mask over your self first before you you help your instinct yeah, yeah

1524
02:10:02.56 --> 02:10:05.92
Because if you're not dope like you you know, you know what I mean?

1525
02:10:05.92 --> 02:10:08.08
So anyway if you need supplements

1526
02:10:08.08 --> 02:10:13.92
Go to on it dot com slash jockel get 10% off on its supplements. What does that mean?

1527
02:10:15.52 --> 02:10:18.32
That's the best supplements like any guy 10% off

1528
02:10:19.60 --> 02:10:24.32
I could explain whether so good, but you can go on the website read it just trust me. It's only supplements

1529
02:10:24.88 --> 02:10:27.68
I take in you to right yes and be or you take something else

1530
02:10:28.56 --> 02:10:30.56
Don't buy them

1531
02:10:31.36 --> 02:10:33.36
Or you can support buy

1532
02:10:33.36 --> 02:10:38.16
clicking through before you do Amazon shopping click through the website or just get the trooper tool

1533
02:10:38.16 --> 02:10:39.36
I think that would be a lot easier

1534
02:10:39.52 --> 02:10:44.56
So you're going to website get the troop tools called jockel podcast trooper tool chrome extension click on it

1535
02:10:44.96 --> 02:10:49.12
Boom confirm boom it's on there any time you shop at Amazon you support passively

1536
02:10:50.32 --> 02:10:52.80
This podcast and you're kind of official

1537
02:10:53.60 --> 02:10:57.36
That's dope. I don't like the word pass over even though I know it's the correct term

1538
02:10:57.36 --> 02:11:04.56
Because when you are shop that's that's a really good easy way to support the podcast. Yeah, so I don't

1539
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:11.76
agree with you on the past yeah, I like passing they're actively shopping actively getting after it

1540
02:11:12.80 --> 02:11:14.80
Passively supporting I did

1541
02:11:16.72 --> 02:11:23.28
They actively went to the website they actively installed the tool or they click through their taking action

1542
02:11:23.28 --> 02:11:31.12

Mama granted

1589
02:15:06.72 --> 02:15:13.52
Maybe we have a little something coming out working with the working with a company a lot of people would talk to me about

1590
02:15:14.24 --> 02:15:16.24
the beverage that I drink

1591
02:15:16.24 --> 02:15:20.000
Yeah, I drink some alpha brain, but my most common beverage

1592
02:15:21.28 --> 02:15:26.56
Yep, and that and find that on Tim Ferris right? Yeah, I like it first people went crazy

1593
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:31.44
Yeah, because he was asking hey, what is that what is that? What is that? What is it? He drank it? He got all fired up

1594
02:15:31.44 --> 02:15:35.84
Listen listen to Tim Ferris back. Yeah, he's like oh, this is like in a adrenaline field

1595
02:15:35.84 --> 02:15:39.28
There's caffeine in the oven. Yeah, there's there's a small amount of caffeine

1596
02:15:40.16 --> 02:15:43.92
Well, I shouldn't say small usually usually usually white teas about a third of a cup of coffee

1597
02:15:44.88 --> 02:15:48.96
So it's pre-mile on the caffeine. Yeah, it's like a micro dose of caffeine

1598
02:15:49.28 --> 02:15:51.92
There's maybe oxins in there and it tastes good

1599
02:15:55.04 --> 02:15:57.04
And so anyway, as I got approached about

1600
02:15:57.92 --> 02:16:02.16
Hey, we are we are fans of the jockel podcast and guess what we make tea?

1601
02:16:02.16 --> 02:16:08.64
Boom, we want to make your tea. So I went through some iterations trying to find it in tune it

1602
02:16:09.20 --> 02:16:14.16
Yeah, little the mixture and now we got a song

1603
02:16:14.96 --> 02:16:20.88
Jockel way tea. That's gonna be good. Yeah, so we'll put it on the jockel store

You know, when man this I don't know when that'll be out. Yeah, sometimes yeah, and

1606
02:16:28.56 --> 02:16:34.80
You put the thing on there where people can have get emails from us

1607
02:16:35.52 --> 02:16:42.72
Yeah, oh, yeah, side the mailing list right yeah, but simple as a mailing list. It's it's more for like in like insider

1608
02:16:42.72 --> 02:16:44.72
As you care about like

1609
02:16:45.20 --> 02:16:46.72
I don't know insider stuff

1610
02:16:47.04 --> 02:16:52.08
So I don't you know how like there's a lot of mailing list or whatever you can get on and know like send you a mail every

1611
02:16:52.64 --> 02:16:57.36
Make it a point not to send you stuff that's like not relevant because you sometimes

1612
02:16:57.36 --> 02:17:02.96
No, I've seen enough for that before. Yeah, no don't fill people's email box with stuff that is

1613
02:17:04.40 --> 02:17:08.56
Stuff yeah, it's like hey, here's my email violate my trust

1614
02:17:09.28 --> 02:17:11.28

One of these people might be interested in this lemme send it to everybody's not that kind no

1617
02:17:22.32 --> 02:17:31.76
Is if I think everybody's me interested I could be wrong, but if I think that genuinely and then I'll send you something and furthermore if there is

1618
02:17:33.52 --> 02:17:36.64
Epandemic epic disaster situation

1619
02:17:37.28 --> 02:17:39.28
I will be sending forth instructions

1620
02:17:40.24 --> 02:17:46.40
For all troopers to congregate and dominate that's what we're gonna do to the event of the zombie apocalypse

1621
02:17:47.20 --> 02:17:50.32
So that alone right there's the reason and at some point

1622
02:17:50.32 --> 02:17:53.68
See now at some point I may send out like

1623
02:17:54.64 --> 02:17:58.08
A longer thing like for instance up coming

1624
02:17:59.04 --> 02:18:04.64
We got the master right later. I'm doing here in San Diego got to get out some details on that so people know

1625
02:18:05.44 --> 02:18:09.68
When it's going down all that stuff I'm gonna send that out to there

1626
02:18:10.24 --> 02:18:14.40
So that people know what's happening they get connected so that's that's an example. Yeah

1627
02:18:14.40 --> 02:18:19.92
Am I gonna email it 47 times no yeah hey reminder, but I

1628
02:18:20.88 --> 02:18:24.24
Know if you're enlisted on the on the mail

1629
02:18:24.80 --> 02:18:30.64
Then you're interested in what we're saying yeah, so I think that's what we're putting out there. Yeah, oh, we're not gonna violate that

1630
02:18:31.36 --> 02:18:34.16
Here's my email violate my trust yeah

1631
02:18:35.52 --> 02:18:41.36
You know how they'll cause they'll send you stuff but every like three days. Oh, yeah, if you let them so no there's multiple times a day

1632
02:18:41.36 --> 02:18:43.36
Oh

1633
02:18:42.88 --> 02:18:50.40
Who does that why would you why is that I'm not gonna send any name marketing? I don't know is that considered to be good marketing? Somebody must be telling people to do that

1634
02:18:51.84 --> 02:18:55.44
I don't know you know what that's that's that's what I don't want to do

1635
02:18:56.88 --> 02:18:58.88
Is market things

1636
02:18:58.88 --> 02:19:04.32
Yeah, okay, that's the thing if anybody out there thinks I'm marketing things stop me

1637
02:19:05.36 --> 02:19:06.64
Do it well

1638
02:19:06.64 --> 02:19:13.92
I did understand lately there's a difference between advertising and marketing so marketing is everything like if even you wearing that shirt

1639
02:19:14.32 --> 02:19:15.12
That's

1640
02:19:15.12 --> 02:19:19.68
Technique marketing for advertising okay. Well the other hand right busted

1641
02:19:20.72 --> 02:19:22.32
I don't want to get into a big thing here

1642
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:28.88
I was talking to them. Well I guess within we market and we advertise for no we market don't have forever ties

1643
02:19:29.36 --> 02:19:31.36
We don't

1644
02:19:31.36 --> 02:19:39.60
No, okay, what about when I say what about when you say hey on it has good stuff and I say yeah get the curloil that's on it

1645
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:42.80
Technically okay, I'm I'm

1646
02:19:42.88 --> 02:19:48.96
We're in the advertising well what I don't want to do is beat people down with you know by this by that

1647
02:19:48.96 --> 02:19:50.96
I don't want to do that. Yeah

1648
02:19:50.96 --> 02:19:56.56
On it is actually supporting the podcast and I support on it that's Joe Rogan's company and

1649
02:19:56.56 --> 02:20:02.96
And Joe Rogan's a great guy who helped us out who what by the way we're sitting here because of Joe Rogan

1650
02:20:03.52 --> 02:20:04.48
FYI

1651
02:20:04.48 --> 02:20:07.52
All right the other way. Hey also you got the

1652
02:20:08.08 --> 02:20:10.08
You can buy a little book called Extreme Ownership

1653
02:20:10.64 --> 02:20:17.36
Britain by myself and my brother, Dave Babin who was on the last podcast podcast 34 he was also on podcast 11

1654
02:20:18.72 --> 02:20:20.08
And we wrote a book

1655
02:20:20.08 --> 02:20:23.84
It's about leadership. It's about war. It's about business. It's about life

1656
02:20:23.84 --> 02:20:27.92
And it's available in hard-covered digital audio format both

1657
02:20:29.04 --> 02:20:32.08
Life and I reread the sections that we wrote so that's cool

1658
02:20:32.80 --> 02:20:38.32
And you know what's cool is get it for yourself, which is cool. It'll help you but then help you team

1659
02:20:38.72 --> 02:20:43.76
Grab them a copy and you're helping us you know a little bit. Yeah, it's for support because

1660
02:20:43.76 --> 02:20:49.36
Think good about that book. I said this before but it's it's worth saying again is that you know all like some

1661
02:20:49.36 --> 02:20:53.28
Books is like okay. I'm an imp you know improve and and

1662
02:20:54.08 --> 02:20:57.60
Whatever. I'm gonna read this book. It's just helped me in this way or that way or whatever

1663
02:20:57.76 --> 02:21:02.16
But this is like the kind stuff where you can literally turn on that like right when you read a certain sentence

1664
02:21:02.16 --> 02:21:06.88
And it's giving you whatever you know whatever this advice is whichever one it is but the Extreme Ownership will say

1665
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:12.40
You can turn it on right then and there like right then and there you can walk away and you have to read the whole book technically and

1666
02:21:13.20 --> 02:21:18.96
It'll you're already be changed. That's all you just gotta do it. I'm saying like not all books

1667
02:21:18.96 --> 02:21:21.92
You're like that it's like oh yeah, it's a gradual process

1668
02:21:22.48 --> 02:21:25.76
That is awesome. But anyway, that's that's a big takeaway I got from it now

1669
02:21:27.28 --> 02:21:33.92
As always if you want to let us know what's going on in your world you're gonna continue this little talk that we're having amongst us

1670
02:21:35.04 --> 02:21:37.04
What are up in the webs?

1671
02:21:37.84 --> 02:21:42.40
Twitter Facebookie and Instagram echo is at echo Charles

1672
02:21:42.40 --> 02:21:48.88
And I am at juggle willing now one of the things that I've made a note here to talk about a little bit

1673
02:21:49.60 --> 02:21:53.76
Gotta gotta come clean here gotta address something

1674
02:21:55.28 --> 02:21:57.28
Went on a little

1675
02:21:57.28 --> 02:22:02.24
Trip into the bush was out of contact before I left on the trip

1676
02:22:05.68 --> 02:22:07.68
I

1677
02:22:07.92 --> 02:22:11.04
Stopped I didn't stop but I could no longer keep up

1678
02:22:11.04 --> 02:22:17.04
Couldn't no longer keep up with responding there was a time there all up until

1679
02:22:19.04 --> 02:22:22.32
A week ago maybe maybe a week and a half ago

1680
02:22:23.04 --> 02:22:29.36
I committed and responded to every single person that hit me on Twitter a hundred percent

1681
02:22:30.80 --> 02:22:32.80
And I kept

1682
02:22:32.80 --> 02:22:40.48
Trying to maintain and I told everyone I'm remain tame and I maintain for a long time for what six months seven months something like that

1683
02:22:41.12 --> 02:22:46.64
But I cannot maintain anymore. I cannot respond to every single person

1684
02:22:47.60 --> 02:22:51.76
And especially coming back from being in the field for

1685
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:57.36
You know seven days where I didn't have it or I have it very sparingly

1686
02:22:57.36 --> 02:23:03.20
I'm getting thousands of tweets a day which is awesome and you know what I do read them all

1687
02:23:03.76 --> 02:23:07.36
I absolutely read them all but to respond every single one of them

1688
02:23:07.36 --> 02:23:13.20
I don't I don't have time starting about a week and a half ago. I just said nine I can't do this because

1689
02:23:14.40 --> 02:23:19.04
First of all we went to the whole thing of like oh we're gonna go two times a week for the podcast or the one time

1690
02:23:19.44 --> 02:23:22.000
Two times a month for the podcast maybe one ever two weeks

1691
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:27.52
Most people didn't like that. I didn't like that. I want to come and get it on so

1692
02:23:28.16 --> 02:23:34.000
But well and and I used to be able to respond to the Twitter in like 45 minutes a day which I find that time

1693
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.48
I'll make that time then it was an hour then it was an hour and ten minutes and all of a sudden it became

1694
02:23:38.88 --> 02:23:44.40
Two hours a day and then if think about this if I missed a day for whatever reason

1695
02:23:44.80 --> 02:23:48.72
One missed a day and a half five hours finally one Sunday

1696
02:23:48.72 --> 02:23:52.96
I sat down and I did Twitter for a

1697
02:23:53.76 --> 02:23:57.36
Stupid amount of time you know six something hours and

1698
02:23:58.48 --> 02:24:00.48
Twitter's a great method of communication

1699
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:03.52
but

1700
02:24:03.52 --> 02:24:11.60
I got to be more selective and disciplined about my time management. I don't want to carry this on even further, but

1701
02:24:11.60 --> 02:24:18.96
There is an um kind of like kind of laughing is that because you're kind of new to social media

1702
02:24:19.52 --> 02:24:22.24
So kind of but it's funny because like you're

1703
02:24:23.84 --> 02:24:29.04
This is gonna sound strange but you're that like nice of a person that you're like

1704
02:24:29.84 --> 02:24:32.08
Telling everyone like we know

1705
02:24:32.48 --> 02:24:36.48
You know you can't just find everybody right but you're like really bothered by you like guy

1706
02:24:36.48 --> 02:24:40.48
I can't I'm not being rude. I'm not being rude. That's what's fun. That's what's funny

1707
02:24:40.48 --> 02:24:44.96
Because from your perspective, it's like it's like someone's talking to you for real and you're just like

1708
02:24:45.36 --> 02:24:49.60
Basically putting your finger up saying I don't you know, I don't have time for you. Yeah, but

1709
02:24:50.16 --> 02:24:55.60
Anything we are kind of a group a team right? Yeah, which makes it even yeah

1710
02:24:55.60 --> 02:25:01.36
of which I'm sort of like the guy that facilitates the communication between us from almost a leadership position

1711
02:25:01.68 --> 02:25:04.32
And so for now people and you know what was funny because uh

1712
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:09.84
One of one of the troopers guy in Brandon who's been it in the games since day one. I forget how he

1713
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:14.80
I think I think you listen to Tim Ferriss Bar and he immediately like followed me on Twitter and

1714
02:25:16.56 --> 02:25:20.32
We were going back and forth on a bunch of stuff and and finally we were emailing about some stuff

1715
02:25:20.32 --> 02:25:22.32
We were emailing about uh

1716
02:25:22.72 --> 02:25:24.72
He was he was trying to get timex

1717
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:27.60
To sponsor

1718
02:25:27.60 --> 02:25:31.76
Yeah, the podcast or me or something because timex is selling watches

1719
02:25:32.16 --> 02:25:33.68
factually

1720
02:25:33.68 --> 02:25:38.24
The a lot of people have bought timex iron man matches watches

1721
02:25:38.72 --> 02:25:44.24
People from your things just from from wanting to get in the game, you know, oh yeah, that's cool man. Let's do it

1722
02:25:45.04 --> 02:25:51.36
You know and so a lot of people have factually bought those watches and so Brandon trooper was like hey

1723
02:25:51.36 --> 02:25:54.64
You know what I'm gonna contact these guys so we went back on a bunch of emails

1724
02:25:55.20 --> 02:25:57.20
I have pictures

1725
02:25:57.20 --> 02:25:58.72
of me

1726
02:25:58.72 --> 02:26:02.24
With this watch on with this timex watch that you see on my Twitter feed

1727
02:26:02.24 --> 02:26:11.12
Not the exact same watch, but the same model watch the same model and I have I think five of them right now and actually

1728
02:26:11.60 --> 02:26:16.08
Some troopers sent me other older because you can't buy him anymore

1729
02:26:16.40 --> 02:26:20.08
So I have I have enough of these watches to last me for the rest of my life

1730
02:26:20.48 --> 02:26:22.48
You know, I think it's about five or six

1731
02:26:23.36 --> 02:26:28.000
And I've actually done surgery on these watches over the years like like things yeah

1732
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.84
Like one would break a certain part so I had taken another one apart and I put the insights and you know

1733
02:26:31.84 --> 02:26:38.08
So one day I was reading an email from Brandon because we emailed back and forth on this a couple times and then the other day

1734
02:26:38.08 --> 02:26:39.92
He emailed me just said hey just so you know

1735
02:26:40.32 --> 02:26:44.96
I haven't given up on them still on timex and I said I'm an email and I was reading it on the way here

1736
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
to record

1737
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:49.28
and

1738
02:26:49.28 --> 02:26:50.80
And I was looking through the email

1739
02:26:51.52 --> 02:26:54.16
When I parked I saw his phone number at the bottom

1740
02:26:54.16 --> 02:27:01.36
And I just hit you know it's iPhone I hit I hit the thing you're Nicole and I said

1741
02:27:01.92 --> 02:27:04.16
And he's okay, this is Brandon and I said hey, what's up, man?

1742
02:27:04.16 --> 02:27:06.96
It's so cool he's like really yeah, man, what's going on?

1743
02:27:07.36 --> 02:27:13.36
I was one of the touch-based and he's and so I said so we started talking and this was right as the social media

1744
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.36
I was reaching the kind of the end of the line of social media

1745
02:27:18.48 --> 02:27:21.68
And as I'm sort of thinking about how I'm gonna

1746
02:27:21.68 --> 02:27:27.28
Manage and how I'm gonna like if I could tell people like listen, I'm sorry I just can't

1747
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I physically can't do it

1748
02:27:31.76 --> 02:27:37.12
And one of the things he says to me while we're talking he goes you know what's so awesome is that you respond to everybody

1749
02:27:39.12 --> 02:27:41.12
So I stuck with it

1750
02:27:41.12 --> 02:27:46.88
Okay, you know what I'm behind him and he's sit down and I think that's when I did like a Sunday where I just sat there like an idiot

1751
02:27:47.12 --> 02:27:50.16
You know what I know but it just boom boom boom boom

1752
02:27:50.16 --> 02:27:54.08
Yeah, and I think it's too slow people are telling me good stuff and I'm like, why I say hey, man

1753
02:27:54.08 --> 02:27:56.40
I think that's good point. Oh, that's a good book. I'm gonna check that out

1754
02:27:57.04 --> 02:28:03.36
So we need to tell me that I said okay, and hold the line. I hold the line press and then and then I realize if I'm gonna hold the line on that

1755
02:28:03.92 --> 02:28:06.80
I'm gonna let go of more important things one of them being the podcast

1756
02:28:07.44 --> 02:28:11.04
Yeah, one of them being the podcast and not putting forth quality podcast which to me is

1757
02:28:11.52 --> 02:28:18.72
the most important thing that that I'm doing right now is is getting the podcast quality from a podcast perspective, right

1758
02:28:18.72 --> 02:28:19.76
Sure

1759
02:28:19.76 --> 02:28:23.92
Um, so yeah, there's my uh, there's my social media adventures

1760
02:28:23.92 --> 02:28:31.92
No, yeah, what it's funny to think of it from your perspective because I would argue. Oh, yes that from everyone else's perspective

1761
02:28:32.16 --> 02:28:33.92
It's like yeah, no

1762
02:28:33.92 --> 02:28:40.64
No kidding. Yeah, yeah, you're here. He's getting but not man good and you really you're the yeah, I think that's that's cool

1763
02:28:41.20 --> 02:28:46.24
Well apologize everybody, but uh, and I'm I'm still I'm telling you I'm still like reading them

1764
02:28:46.24 --> 02:28:50.40
But it's I can't respond there

1765
02:28:51.44 --> 02:28:58.40
Got you the man but what I'm gonna try and do since I don't have to be sweating the the more responses if I treat

1766
02:28:58.40 --> 02:29:04.96
I'm gonna try and like do be a little bit more active as things happen cool things happen whatever yeah, we'll see how that works out

1767
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:08.96
All right

1768
02:29:09.52 --> 02:29:11.52
