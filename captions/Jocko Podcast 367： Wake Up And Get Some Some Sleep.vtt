00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.02
This is Jocko podcast number 367 with echo Charles and me Jocko willing a good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:06.02 --> 00:00:11.06
I don't like going to the doctor. Okay, just FYI. I don't like hospitals

3
00:00:11.94 --> 00:00:13.94
actually, I

4
00:00:13.94 --> 00:00:20.66
Always think that things are they're just gonna heal up right the body's just gonna Wolverine and just heal up and

5
00:00:21.90 --> 00:00:24.56
They do most of the time occasionally they don't

6
00:00:26.22 --> 00:00:28.82
One time I woke up in the morning, I couldn't move my right arm

7
00:00:28.82 --> 00:00:31.68
But didn't move which is not a good feeling. I

8
00:00:32.68 --> 00:00:35.20
Was like, okay. Well, it'll get better. It didn't

9
00:00:35.92 --> 00:00:37.92
Had to go to the doctor

10
00:00:38.36 --> 00:00:44.12
Went to the doctor got you know neck surgery. So unless something is really bad

11
00:00:44.96 --> 00:00:46.96
I'm not going to the doctor. I

12
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:53.44
Don't know if that's left over from basic seal training where they you're avoiding medical at all costs

13
00:00:53.44 --> 00:01:00.22
Because you don't want to get rolled or anything, but it's stuck with me. Don't like the doctor a little while after I had neck surgery I

14
00:01:01.10 --> 00:01:04.66
Start I would start randomly getting dizzy

15
00:01:06.06 --> 00:01:07.34
Like

16
00:01:07.34 --> 00:01:14.38
Like dizzy like I just spun around in circles. Sometimes I would get really dizzy sometimes I would be trying to walk and

17
00:01:15.18 --> 00:01:21.06
I would be bouncing into walls. So I'm talking legitimately busy. I was nauseous a

18
00:01:21.06 --> 00:01:23.06
lot

19
00:01:23.94 --> 00:01:28.78
Almost almost like a continual almost all the time nauseous and

20
00:01:30.90 --> 00:01:36.12
Man sometimes jiu-jitsu I would be doing jiu-jitsu and I'd like roll or spin or something like that

21
00:01:36.12 --> 00:01:39.56
And it would just be the jet the whole gym would just start spinning

22
00:01:40.50 --> 00:01:42.50
sometimes I would roll over in bed at night and

23
00:01:42.90 --> 00:01:49.70
The room would start spinning it was then you know, you're feeling sick and I kind of learned

24
00:01:49.70 --> 00:01:57.18
To avoid some things, you know and jiu-jitsu I try not to go inverted and stuff like this and in bed

25
00:01:57.18 --> 00:02:02.70
I've learned to roll out if I wanted to roll over in bed or even to roll to get out of bed

26
00:02:02.70 --> 00:02:05.78
I would learn to do it very very slowly and avoid

27
00:02:06.30 --> 00:02:08.10
head movement

28
00:02:08.10 --> 00:02:09.42
And I thought it would go away

29
00:02:09.42 --> 00:02:15.78
And I'm waiting for go to a waiting for Wolverine blood to flow and for the problem to stop and it didn't stop

30
00:02:15.78 --> 00:02:23.42
So again went to the hospital once the doctor and they did all kinds of tests on me MRI tests and blood tests and they

31
00:02:24.18 --> 00:02:29.70
Ear nose and throat spine and they just did they look at everything and they didn't have an answer for me

32
00:02:30.26 --> 00:02:35.54
And so I'm just dealing with it just btf and just dealing with it

33
00:02:36.10 --> 00:02:38.10
and it definitely sucked and

34
00:02:39.70 --> 00:02:42.62
Then like so fast forward a year or something like that

35
00:02:42.62 --> 00:02:46.90
I'm actually starting my retirement processing and I'm starting my

36
00:02:48.26 --> 00:02:53.34
Retirement physical you got to get a physical before you retire and I'm talking to the doc for the West Coast seals and

37
00:02:54.06 --> 00:03:00.78
What's cool about this particular doc as he was a seal himself who had gone to the military medical school and become a doctor

38
00:03:00.78 --> 00:03:02.78
So, you know, we knew each other

39
00:03:02.98 --> 00:03:08.30
And he's get you know, we're hanging out and then he's given me sort of this the standard retirement physical questions

40
00:03:08.30 --> 00:03:16.34
About my health and I'm giving him the standard retirement answers, which is fine. Yep fine. Yep, that's fine

41
00:03:16.82 --> 00:03:22.46
And finally, you know, we're just kind of shooting shooting the breeze a little bit. He goes anything else, you know, did I miss anything and

42
00:03:24.18 --> 00:03:26.18
I said, well, you know

43
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:32.54
No one's been able to help me but I'll throw it out there. I said, yeah, man for the last like year year and a half

44
00:03:33.86 --> 00:03:35.70
I've randomly

45
00:03:35.70 --> 00:03:42.26
Gotten just really dizzy sometimes and sometimes it lasts for a long time and it kind of never goes away

46
00:03:42.26 --> 00:03:44.70
I'm always in like a constant state of that

47
00:03:45.22 --> 00:03:48.18
He's like kind of tilts his head a little bit look to me and

48
00:03:48.74 --> 00:03:53.38
Kind of thumbing through my record. He seemed now that he's looking at his scenes a bunch of tests that I've been through and everything like this

49
00:03:55.02 --> 00:03:58.46
And he says, you know, I think I might know what this might be and

50
00:03:59.46 --> 00:04:03.74
He literally like turns to his computer and this is 2010 but

51
00:04:03.74 --> 00:04:07.10
Or maybe it was 2009 something like that because I retired in 2010

52
00:04:07.10 --> 00:04:10.74
But it was something it was like around that time, but he turns his computer and he googles some stuff

53
00:04:11.74 --> 00:04:13.74
And he's like here here look at this

54
00:04:14.38 --> 00:04:16.90
And he says benign positional vertigo

55
00:04:17.74 --> 00:04:19.74
He goes we got to do these little exercises

56
00:04:20.34 --> 00:04:21.74
and

57
00:04:21.74 --> 00:04:22.74
I'm like

58
00:04:22.74 --> 00:04:29.74
Okay, I mean, I don't know what he's talking about right benign positional vertigo. I don't know what this means and

59
00:04:29.74 --> 00:04:34.74
Then he like says okay lay down put your head over here turn it backwards turn over sit back up again

60
00:04:34.74 --> 00:04:39.74
And he goes just does like three or four times does these exercise and then like says all right stand up

61
00:04:41.74 --> 00:04:43.74
And he looks at me and he goes how how's that?

62
00:04:44.74 --> 00:04:48.74
And I'm like doing a self-assessment and I'm like

63
00:04:49.74 --> 00:04:50.74
Dude

64
00:04:51.74 --> 00:04:52.74
It's gone

65
00:04:52.74 --> 00:04:56.74
I'm good like literally in two minutes

66
00:04:56.74 --> 00:05:00.74
More than a year of dizziness and constant

67
00:05:00.74 --> 00:05:04.74
Tests and exams and this thing has gone in two minutes that seal doc

68
00:05:05.74 --> 00:05:07.74
Gave me my balance back

69
00:05:08.74 --> 00:05:13.74
And it was pretty freakin awesome and this particular doc has helped

70
00:05:15.74 --> 00:05:20.74
Countless other seals overcome countless health challenges of all kinds

71
00:05:21.74 --> 00:05:23.74
His name is Kirk Parsley

72
00:05:23.74 --> 00:05:25.74
And

73
00:05:25.74 --> 00:05:29.74
It's an honor to have him with us here today to talk about what he learned

74
00:05:30.74 --> 00:05:33.74
in his life in the teams and

75
00:05:34.74 --> 00:05:36.74
Taking care of team guys. So doc

76
00:05:37.74 --> 00:05:42.74
Thanks for coming by man. Hey, man. Thanks for having you remember that. I mean I know you see like eight million people

77
00:05:42.74 --> 00:05:44.74
So I remember very clearly

78
00:05:45.74 --> 00:05:47.74
Yeah, did you with the Eplume maneuver?

79
00:05:47.74 --> 00:05:51.74
Yeah, but you you you weren't like sure about it

80
00:05:51.74 --> 00:05:54.74
When you said it to me you're sort of like look at you kind of it was like

81
00:05:55.74 --> 00:06:01.74
It seemed as if you had heard a rumor about something that it could have been and you kind of like halfway remembered it

82
00:06:01.74 --> 00:06:07.74
And then you I could I could remember I could remember the name of the test that you do to test people for that right

83
00:06:08.74 --> 00:06:11.74
And I was like and I'm blanking on now

84
00:06:11.74 --> 00:06:15.74
It's like pikes haul something or like this and I was like hmm

85
00:06:15.74 --> 00:06:20.74
And you look for the nystagmus right the shaking of the eyes and something you do to like hop on the ground

86
00:06:20.74 --> 00:06:22.74
something you do to like hospital patients and

87
00:06:23.74 --> 00:06:25.74
And so I knew that part and I was like I know

88
00:06:26.74 --> 00:06:34.74
So there's a little stone in one of your semi-circular canals and it's blocking that and so the fluid's not flowing and it's the same as sea sickness or something right at that point and so

89
00:06:35.74 --> 00:06:37.74
I remember

90
00:06:37.74 --> 00:06:43.74
I remember well, there's there's a way to tilt there's a way to tilt this out and I couldn't remember if there's like a certain pattern could give three

91
00:06:43.74 --> 00:06:47.74
Canals and they're all at different angles. So that's why you like turn your head at all these different angles so many times

92
00:06:47.74 --> 00:06:51.74
And I was like, oh, I know there's another something to like do this and you know medicine's full of

93
00:06:52.74 --> 00:06:58.74
What called eponyms like you know the shit's just named after people right so what is Epley maneuver?

94
00:06:59.74 --> 00:07:03.74
It's not descriptive at all. So I don't know what the hell that means to somebody's name and there's a new

95
00:07:04.74 --> 00:07:09.74
I'm like there's some kind of thing and so that's what I googled like you know clearing

96
00:07:10.74 --> 00:07:11.74
Odell

97
00:07:11.74 --> 00:07:18.74
Yeah, and so it's just like clearing the stones that are in the semi-circular canal and I think I'm looking for that video

98
00:07:18.74 --> 00:07:20.74
I'm like, oh, here's how we do it. So I

99
00:07:21.74 --> 00:07:27.74
Remember like gleaning the table back down and going to do it right because like we knew each other. We didn't know each other super well at that point

100
00:07:28.74 --> 00:07:30.74
Me but you had your fucking

101
00:07:31.74 --> 00:07:33.24
BTF

102
00:07:33.24 --> 00:07:34.64
You know

103
00:07:34.64 --> 00:07:35.74
Reputation

104
00:07:35.74 --> 00:07:39.24
I don't know if I ever told you did you ever hear about the bracelets?

105
00:07:39.24 --> 00:07:43.24
No at our clinic right so we at the rehab clinic

106
00:07:44.24 --> 00:07:47.24
You know Jason chain trained all these guys and

107
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:51.24
You know

108
00:07:51.24 --> 00:07:57.24
It's hard to bounce back from surgeries a lot of time right and people aren't all that motivated because they're just they're used to like this

109
00:07:57.24 --> 00:08:05.24
Performance. I mean I'm supposed to be up here and like they're barely like they're barely performing like a grade school kid or something

110
00:08:05.24 --> 00:08:14.24
And so there's always a motivation component and so he had these tests for people to like you know try to try to get to this level

111
00:08:14.24 --> 00:08:20.24
Try to get to that level try to it's like these progressive steps and so and then there was some sort of reward involved in it and that's

112
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:26.74
That's how we ended up doing Sears Tower with Elliott and all that stuff like that was part of the reward kind of pathway and

113
00:08:27.24 --> 00:08:34.24
One thing we so this is heretic and I hope your audience doesn't hate me for saying this but the WW JD

114
00:08:34.24 --> 00:08:39.24
What would Jesus do bracelet weird like a hundred of those and we gave them and they were what would jaco do?

115
00:08:41.24 --> 00:08:43.74
And we had like this running list on the wall like

116
00:08:45.24 --> 00:08:47.24
Chuck Norris kind of

117
00:08:48.24 --> 00:08:50.24
My contribution was

118
00:08:50.74 --> 00:08:52.74
Jocko sleeps with the pillow under his gun

119
00:08:52.74 --> 00:09:02.74
Yeah, so you know you had reputation and I knew you're and it's and I remember doing all that and going oh this works

120
00:09:04.74 --> 00:09:09.74
And yeah, and and I and then we you know as we got to know each other more of the years

121
00:09:09.74 --> 00:09:12.74
I know you you had to do that. Do you still have to do it?

122
00:09:12.74 --> 00:09:17.74
I probably have to do it once a year and it but it's it's just such a non factor now

123
00:09:17.74 --> 00:09:23.74
I go there it is. I'm a little dizzy. I just do it and man. It's I was like that for a year and a half and it was

124
00:09:24.74 --> 00:09:29.74
Gnarly gnarly. I remember I was doing I was training a guy for a fight an MMA fight and

125
00:09:31.74 --> 00:09:37.74
He was like ground and pound like we had gloves on like we're going at it and all of a sudden like I did something where I did

126
00:09:37.74 --> 00:09:42.74
A quick head movement and all of a sudden I got super like like more even more dizzy than normal

127
00:09:42.74 --> 00:09:46.74
And I'm standing there. I'm like laying on my back and he's in my garden. He's punching me in the head and

128
00:09:47.74 --> 00:09:53.74
I look at the clock and the clock. There's like this was this was Thomas remember Thomas

129
00:09:54.74 --> 00:10:03.74
Yeah, yeah, I mean he's this freaking Polish warrior. Yeah, and he's punching me in the head and I'm there's like 20 seconds left

130
00:10:03.74 --> 00:10:12.74
And I'm just like please let this stop and I I got up and walk and I like was doing a drunk walk out, you know all unstable

131
00:10:12.74 --> 00:10:18.74
And he was kind of like looking at me as if he had hit me too hard or something is just like no, I'm leaving now

132
00:10:20.74 --> 00:10:23.74
That and when the good thing you have thick skull

133
00:10:24.74 --> 00:10:30.74
From that guy for sure. He's a beast. Yeah, I had a actually that's when that's when yawn the the

134
00:10:30.74 --> 00:10:32.74
Champ yeah, not currently but

135
00:10:33.74 --> 00:10:41.74
Hopefully coming back for it. Just part with that maniac dude. That's not a good way to be healthy

136
00:10:42.74 --> 00:10:45.74
Yeah, and then I had the I don't know if you remember this I I

137
00:10:46.74 --> 00:10:48.74
Go I

138
00:10:48.74 --> 00:10:50.74
Was training jiu-jitsu

139
00:10:51.74 --> 00:10:54.74
I didn't I did a no Dean did a

140
00:10:55.74 --> 00:10:57.74
Bicep slice on me and like my bicep like

141
00:10:57.74 --> 00:11:02.74
Popped and moved and I was like God you got a partial tear remember any and so I go in I see Jason

142
00:11:02.74 --> 00:11:05.74
I see doc and they're like yep. Hey, we can get you scheduled for surgery right now

143
00:11:05.74 --> 00:11:09.74
You know like and I go cool like sign me up. Let's rock and roll and then they go

144
00:11:09.74 --> 00:11:15.74
Okay, yep, we got you signed up your your surgery is gonna be in four weeks or something like this three weeks or something like this

145
00:11:15.74 --> 00:11:18.74
And they go come in on this day for your pre-surgery check

146
00:11:18.74 --> 00:11:22.74
I go cool and so I go in I'm like Jason you have him here for my pre-check and he goes

147
00:11:22.74 --> 00:11:26.74
He starts looking at me all weird and stuff like I'm not normal and he's like hey doc

148
00:11:26.74 --> 00:11:28.74
Can you come and they come and look at me and they're like

149
00:11:29.74 --> 00:11:31.74
You're healed

150
00:11:33.74 --> 00:11:36.74
And I was like yes, yeah, I I'm back. I see

151
00:11:37.74 --> 00:11:44.74
I remember I remember that like they're they're still being like some sort of defect in that and

152
00:11:44.74 --> 00:11:51.74
And we I remember we told you like well still might rip right with what you do because like you're resisting an arm bar or something

153
00:11:51.74 --> 00:11:58.74
You know you doing pull-ups, whatever. Maybe it might still rip and and you're like what happens if it rips or like

154
00:11:58.74 --> 00:12:04.74
Well, then you do this surgery like same surgery pretty much like well to see if it rips

155
00:12:04.74 --> 00:12:07.74
You just went on about your life and I guess it never ripped

156
00:12:07.74 --> 00:12:09.74
No, I'm not sure if it rips

157
00:12:09.74 --> 00:12:13.74
Now now echo over here. He's had one on each arm. He's done. I need that surgery twice

158
00:12:13.74 --> 00:12:16.74
Did I call you when you when that happened to me was I like hey, what's up? Yeah?

159
00:12:16.74 --> 00:12:18.74
So remember that's funny

160
00:12:18.74 --> 00:12:23.74
You don't remember because I was I'm glad you're here to kind of confirm that cuz I didn't believe I was like, right?

161
00:12:23.74 --> 00:12:29.74
It wasn't ripped. Yeah, you can it's not just gonna heal like that. Like it wasn't ripped like the doc made a mistake or whatever

162
00:12:29.74 --> 00:12:31.74
You're like no no, I'm like Wolverine Wolverine

163
00:12:31.74 --> 00:12:35.74
He's got a little bit of a point of view, but I think that's what he's talking about

164
00:12:35.74 --> 00:12:37.38
the doc made a mistake or whatever.

165
00:12:37.38 --> 00:12:39.10
You're like, no, no, no, no, I'm like, Wolverine.

166
00:12:39.10 --> 00:12:42.38
I was like, that sounds good.

167
00:12:42.38 --> 00:12:45.70
That does sound cool, but Brad didn't write or whatever.

168
00:12:45.70 --> 00:12:47.06
He was like, whatever.

169
00:12:47.06 --> 00:12:48.14
It was like an argument.

170
00:12:48.14 --> 00:12:48.98
We would kind of be-

171
00:12:48.98 --> 00:12:49.82
So do you accept now?

172
00:12:49.82 --> 00:12:50.66
I do accept.

173
00:12:50.66 --> 00:12:52.58
Yeah, thanks for confirming that.

174
00:12:52.58 --> 00:12:54.06
All right, enough about that.

175
00:12:54.06 --> 00:12:54.90
Let's get into you.

176
00:12:54.90 --> 00:12:55.74
Let's start at the beginning.

177
00:12:55.74 --> 00:12:58.02
So where were you born?

178
00:12:58.02 --> 00:12:59.10
Where were you born?

179
00:12:59.10 --> 00:13:00.10
Where'd you grow up?

180
00:13:00.10 --> 00:13:05.10
I was born in sort of a sub area of Houston, Spring,

181
00:13:06.58 --> 00:13:08.46
Spring, Texas, Spring Branch, actually.

182
00:13:08.46 --> 00:13:11.46
So Spring Branch Hospital in Houston, outside of Houston.

183
00:13:11.46 --> 00:13:14.02
And then is that where you spent your youth?

184
00:13:14.02 --> 00:13:15.34
Yeah, pretty much.

185
00:13:15.34 --> 00:13:17.90
So by today's standards, definitely,

186
00:13:17.90 --> 00:13:21.78
because Katie, where I'd spent like the second half

187
00:13:21.78 --> 00:13:23.18
of my childhood was in Katie,

188
00:13:25.26 --> 00:13:29.22
that was like 45 minutes outside of Houston then.

189
00:13:29.22 --> 00:13:30.98
And now it's just part of Houston.

190
00:13:30.98 --> 00:13:32.42
Like all the sprawl.

191
00:13:32.42 --> 00:13:35.38
Like you literally drove through like cow pastures

192
00:13:35.38 --> 00:13:37.66
and rice fields for 45 minutes.

193
00:13:37.66 --> 00:13:39.10
And then there was this one road,

194
00:13:39.10 --> 00:13:41.86
and you took that one road for like three or four miles,

195
00:13:41.86 --> 00:13:44.98
and then you ran into the neighborhoods of Katie.

196
00:13:45.94 --> 00:13:48.74
And last time I went there,

197
00:13:48.74 --> 00:13:51.46
there's no break from downtown Houston to that.

198
00:13:51.46 --> 00:13:54.42
It's like all concrete, jungle, like shopping centers.

199
00:13:54.42 --> 00:13:56.26
Big sprawl.

200
00:13:56.26 --> 00:13:58.78
I couldn't even find the house I grew up in.

201
00:13:58.78 --> 00:13:59.82
You think it's still there or no?

202
00:13:59.82 --> 00:14:00.86
It's still there.

203
00:14:00.86 --> 00:14:03.74
But like all the landmarks I knew to look for,

204
00:14:03.74 --> 00:14:05.22
and they've renamed some streets and stuff.

205
00:14:05.22 --> 00:14:08.58
And so when you get off the freeway now,

206
00:14:08.58 --> 00:14:09.66
there's streets immediately.

207
00:14:09.66 --> 00:14:11.18
Well, there was nothing, like I said,

208
00:14:11.18 --> 00:14:13.06
for three or four miles, there was just pastures

209
00:14:13.06 --> 00:14:15.34
where we rode our motorcycles and played football

210
00:14:15.34 --> 00:14:18.58
and whatever, even when hunting.

211
00:14:18.58 --> 00:14:22.70
And that was all, you know, on whatever farmland

212
00:14:22.70 --> 00:14:24.50
and on touch thicket.

213
00:14:24.50 --> 00:14:28.10
And it was just like buildings and shopping centers

214
00:14:28.10 --> 00:14:28.94
and streets.

215
00:14:28.94 --> 00:14:32.30
And I'm like, I don't really know how far down to go.

216
00:14:32.30 --> 00:14:34.22
And I was looking for the main kind of street

217
00:14:34.22 --> 00:14:35.94
that went through my neighborhood.

218
00:14:35.94 --> 00:14:39.34
And I think they renamed that street

219
00:14:39.34 --> 00:14:41.98
because they connected it and it's much longer now.

220
00:14:41.98 --> 00:14:46.74
And so I couldn't figure out where to turn left

221
00:14:46.74 --> 00:14:48.26
to like go into the neighborhood.

222
00:14:48.26 --> 00:14:50.38
So small town in Texas.

223
00:14:50.38 --> 00:14:52.34
How come you don't have a Texas accent?

224
00:14:52.34 --> 00:14:53.98
I do when I get really tired.

225
00:14:53.98 --> 00:14:57.14
It's kind of coming back more.

226
00:14:57.14 --> 00:14:59.26
I deliberately got rid of it.

227
00:14:59.26 --> 00:15:00.10
How come?

228
00:15:01.50 --> 00:15:04.70
Just to avoid being chastised for, you know,

229
00:15:04.70 --> 00:15:09.42
like being in the military and people screw with you about,

230
00:15:09.42 --> 00:15:11.94
because I listen to country music and I drove a truck

231
00:15:11.94 --> 00:15:15.26
and, you know, like, redneck, you know,

232
00:15:18.34 --> 00:15:22.46
Chris, my good friend of mine from the steel teams,

233
00:15:22.46 --> 00:15:25.82
he's from essentially Detroit, right?

234
00:15:25.82 --> 00:15:29.82
And he goes like, damn, Texas, go get me some chili.

235
00:15:29.82 --> 00:15:32.38
And everybody just rode me all the time.

236
00:15:32.38 --> 00:15:34.90
So I didn't have a super thick accent,

237
00:15:34.90 --> 00:15:38.06
but, you know, I purposefully got rid of it

238
00:15:38.06 --> 00:15:39.98
now that I'm back in Texas and everybody talks

239
00:15:39.98 --> 00:15:41.38
like I used to talk.

240
00:15:41.38 --> 00:15:42.22
It's coming back.

241
00:15:42.22 --> 00:15:43.22
It comes back.

242
00:15:43.22 --> 00:15:48.22
And then if I get really tired, I think my deflates,

243
00:15:48.22 --> 00:15:49.06
that's my rule.

244
00:15:49.06 --> 00:15:52.62
Like, I think it's an unconscious effort now

245
00:15:52.62 --> 00:15:55.34
to not do that and not.

246
00:15:55.34 --> 00:15:56.94
I've let the clochialisms come back.

247
00:15:56.94 --> 00:15:58.34
Like now I'm fixing to do something.

248
00:15:58.34 --> 00:15:59.86
I wouldn't do that.

249
00:15:59.86 --> 00:16:01.66
And I say y'all instead, you guys,

250
00:16:01.66 --> 00:16:03.34
and I've always thought that was more appropriate

251
00:16:03.34 --> 00:16:05.74
because like that's a contraction for you all.

252
00:16:05.74 --> 00:16:08.42
And guys, this is a gender word.

253
00:16:08.42 --> 00:16:09.78
So it doesn't make any sense.

254
00:16:09.78 --> 00:16:10.62
It's called a bunch of girls.

255
00:16:10.62 --> 00:16:11.46
Hey, you guys.

256
00:16:11.46 --> 00:16:12.90
Hey, y'all, right?

257
00:16:12.90 --> 00:16:16.94
So yeah, it kind of comes and goes.

258
00:16:18.14 --> 00:16:19.38
What'd your parents do?

259
00:16:19.38 --> 00:16:24.38
Well, my father split.

260
00:16:24.42 --> 00:16:25.34
That was what he did.

261
00:16:25.34 --> 00:16:27.98
So like about, I was like six weeks old or something.

262
00:16:29.50 --> 00:16:33.66
And so I actually met him at my wedding when it was 25.

263
00:16:34.58 --> 00:16:35.58
So what'd your mom do?

264
00:16:35.58 --> 00:16:39.86
My mom, so the first half of my childhood,

265
00:16:42.98 --> 00:16:47.46
I mean, we were poor trailer part trash, you know.

266
00:16:47.46 --> 00:16:51.14
And but my mom actually had to drop out of high school

267
00:16:51.14 --> 00:16:52.62
to raise her younger sisters

268
00:16:52.62 --> 00:16:54.18
because her parents ran off, you know.

269
00:16:54.18 --> 00:16:57.58
And so my mom had us when we were super young.

270
00:16:57.58 --> 00:17:00.74
Like me and my sister, she had like 18, 19 years old.

271
00:17:00.74 --> 00:17:05.74
And so she, you know, she got married

272
00:17:05.82 --> 00:17:08.26
right out of high school essentially.

273
00:17:08.26 --> 00:17:11.26
And so she went to, she's going to college

274
00:17:11.26 --> 00:17:13.46
and working as like a cocktail waitress or something

275
00:17:13.46 --> 00:17:14.42
like when I was young.

276
00:17:14.42 --> 00:17:16.66
And then when she remarried,

277
00:17:16.66 --> 00:17:21.38
just when we moved to Katie and she married a,

278
00:17:21.38 --> 00:17:26.38
who's a cop at the time and he'd went on to do other things.

279
00:17:27.38 --> 00:17:29.66
But she started working with Delta Airlines

280
00:17:29.66 --> 00:17:30.86
and was like a reservationist

281
00:17:30.86 --> 00:17:32.66
and then making my flight attendant.

282
00:17:32.66 --> 00:17:34.42
And then she retired from that

283
00:17:34.42 --> 00:17:36.94
and worked for Southwest as a flight attendant for a while.

284
00:17:36.94 --> 00:17:38.86
And now she's in her seventies

285
00:17:38.86 --> 00:17:41.22
and she just retired like a couple of years ago

286
00:17:41.22 --> 00:17:42.06
from Southwest.

287
00:17:42.06 --> 00:17:42.90
She's been getting after it.

288
00:17:42.90 --> 00:17:46.34
She's a hard, she's a hard like Irish redheads.

289
00:17:46.34 --> 00:17:50.38
Like feisty, wiry, straffy, strong woman, you know.

290
00:17:50.38 --> 00:17:53.46
And so, yeah.

291
00:17:53.46 --> 00:17:58.46
And she divorced that stepfather when I was like 16.

292
00:17:58.58 --> 00:18:02.38
He's a super, super abusive to everybody,

293
00:18:02.38 --> 00:18:03.54
but especially me.

294
00:18:04.54 --> 00:18:05.46
And so.

295
00:18:06.90 --> 00:18:08.38
So how did you react to that?

296
00:18:10.98 --> 00:18:12.34
Well, it was a big insult to me

297
00:18:12.34 --> 00:18:14.70
because I was the man of the house until that, right?

298
00:18:14.70 --> 00:18:17.46
So it was like eight, I was up, up until like eight years old.

299
00:18:17.46 --> 00:18:19.30
She got married when I was like eight or nine

300
00:18:19.30 --> 00:18:21.10
and a group of all women.

301
00:18:21.10 --> 00:18:25.86
So it's my mom, her mom, her sisters, my sister.

302
00:18:26.82 --> 00:18:30.86
And at five years old, they'd be like,

303
00:18:30.86 --> 00:18:32.34
Kirk, I think I heard something.

304
00:18:32.34 --> 00:18:33.66
Good look, right?

305
00:18:33.66 --> 00:18:35.14
So, okay.

306
00:18:35.14 --> 00:18:38.58
Get my red rider BB gun and like go and look in,

307
00:18:38.58 --> 00:18:40.86
look in the living room, see if anybody's there.

308
00:18:40.86 --> 00:18:43.34
Literally sent me out in the front yard to kill a water mox

309
00:18:43.34 --> 00:18:44.50
and with a BB gun.

310
00:18:44.50 --> 00:18:48.14
And thank God like a man was driving by

311
00:18:48.14 --> 00:18:50.62
and saw this shit show about to happen.

312
00:18:50.62 --> 00:18:52.14
I'm gonna go save this little boy.

313
00:18:52.14 --> 00:18:54.02
And so he came out and like, you know,

314
00:18:54.02 --> 00:18:55.62
and I taught me how to, you know,

315
00:18:55.62 --> 00:18:58.02
I'd stepped on the snake's head and cut its head off

316
00:18:58.02 --> 00:18:59.34
with his health and all that and whatever.

317
00:18:59.34 --> 00:19:04.34
So I was really blown away by the fact that.

318
00:19:05.58 --> 00:19:06.90
Some other dude showed up.

319
00:19:06.90 --> 00:19:11.14
Some dude's gonna like hurt my mother or hurt my sister,

320
00:19:11.14 --> 00:19:11.98
right?

321
00:19:11.98 --> 00:19:13.98
And so I'd always like try to get involved.

322
00:19:13.98 --> 00:19:15.06
And then he'd turn on me.

323
00:19:15.06 --> 00:19:16.70
And so that was my strategy for a while,

324
00:19:16.70 --> 00:19:19.66
but he's an evil fucking.

325
00:19:19.66 --> 00:19:20.50
Yeah.

326
00:19:20.50 --> 00:19:23.54
And so he figured out, well, it's worse

327
00:19:23.54 --> 00:19:26.46
if I don't turn on Kirk, right?

328
00:19:26.46 --> 00:19:30.34
Just let me keep trying to interject and just ignore me

329
00:19:30.34 --> 00:19:33.02
and keep me hurting my mom or whatever.

330
00:19:33.02 --> 00:19:38.02
So, so I grew up very fucking angry, very angry.

331
00:19:38.02 --> 00:19:43.02
And I went in to kill him and I fully planned on it.

332
00:19:44.18 --> 00:19:49.18
And, you know, my mom, I asked my mom for a wait set

333
00:19:51.06 --> 00:19:52.62
for Christmas when I was eight.

334
00:19:55.42 --> 00:19:56.54
Pumping iron had come out.

335
00:19:56.54 --> 00:19:57.46
I'd seen Arnold.

336
00:19:57.46 --> 00:19:58.30
Yeah.

337
00:19:58.30 --> 00:19:59.82
I was like, you know, the muscles,

338
00:19:59.82 --> 00:20:01.62
I'm gonna crush that mom.

339
00:20:01.62 --> 00:20:05.58
And I knew my dad was a big dude and kind of a badass

340
00:20:05.58 --> 00:20:08.80
and they knew each other.

341
00:20:08.80 --> 00:20:11.38
I grew up in kind of in the same town.

342
00:20:11.38 --> 00:20:14.78
And so I think I was a threat to him.

343
00:20:14.78 --> 00:20:17.50
I was my potential father.

344
00:20:17.50 --> 00:20:19.38
So his biggest fear of it was that I was gonna go

345
00:20:19.38 --> 00:20:23.22
to be better than him, bigger, better, faster,

346
00:20:23.22 --> 00:20:24.30
stronger, whatever.

347
00:20:24.30 --> 00:20:26.30
And all of this fears came true.

348
00:20:27.42 --> 00:20:32.42
But at 16, I had...

349
00:20:33.50 --> 00:20:35.02
So did you get the wait set at eight?

350
00:20:35.02 --> 00:20:36.06
I got the wait set at eight.

351
00:20:36.06 --> 00:20:37.14
You started a jacket steal?

352
00:20:37.14 --> 00:20:40.18
He came into me, he came into my room and was like,

353
00:20:40.18 --> 00:20:41.50
heard you want a wait set.

354
00:20:41.50 --> 00:20:44.30
You want a wait set, or you want to be one of those faggots.

355
00:20:44.30 --> 00:20:46.94
And I'm like, sorry, excuse me.

356
00:20:46.94 --> 00:20:49.86
And he's telling me, well, bodybuilders are all gay.

357
00:20:49.86 --> 00:20:52.06
And that's why they like shave their bodies

358
00:20:52.06 --> 00:20:53.66
and bury it on other men and all this other stuff.

359
00:20:53.66 --> 00:20:57.18
And I'm like, I don't think so, whatever.

360
00:20:57.18 --> 00:20:58.02
So I went to wait.

361
00:20:58.02 --> 00:20:59.26
So I didn't know what to do with him.

362
00:20:59.26 --> 00:21:01.86
I got like the little borrow with the concrete weights.

363
00:21:01.86 --> 00:21:02.70
Oh yeah.

364
00:21:02.70 --> 00:21:04.18
And I was grounded my whole life,

365
00:21:04.18 --> 00:21:05.30
the whole time I was with him.

366
00:21:05.30 --> 00:21:07.46
So if I got a bad report card,

367
00:21:07.46 --> 00:21:09.98
I got grounded to the next report card.

368
00:21:09.98 --> 00:21:11.58
And then grounded to the next,

369
00:21:11.58 --> 00:21:13.86
and then the last report card of the year,

370
00:21:13.86 --> 00:21:15.54
I was grounded six weeks into the summer,

371
00:21:15.54 --> 00:21:16.82
because that's when another report card would get.

372
00:21:16.82 --> 00:21:19.14
So I'd had like eight weeks of summer.

373
00:21:19.14 --> 00:21:21.22
Like that was the only time I had any kind of social life.

374
00:21:21.22 --> 00:21:24.62
So sat in my room a lot, got grounded in my room a lot.

375
00:21:24.62 --> 00:21:27.06
And I'd sit, like all I knew had to do was overhead press.

376
00:21:27.06 --> 00:21:28.86
That's what you think of it.

377
00:21:28.86 --> 00:21:30.70
I just sit there and like overhead pressed

378
00:21:30.70 --> 00:21:32.22
from front and back, from back, front,

379
00:21:32.22 --> 00:21:34.74
and then in curl, and that's all I did.

380
00:21:34.74 --> 00:21:38.06
And I just sit in my room for hours and just lift weights.

381
00:21:39.42 --> 00:21:43.18
And then every time I tried to take any kind of martial arts,

382
00:21:43.18 --> 00:21:46.62
he did everything, could thwart that.

383
00:21:46.62 --> 00:21:50.10
And so I'd get in something

384
00:21:50.10 --> 00:21:52.14
and he'd just make it impossible for me

385
00:21:52.14 --> 00:21:53.14
to stick with it and all that.

386
00:21:53.14 --> 00:21:56.86
So I was really, really angry.

387
00:21:56.86 --> 00:21:59.14
And the only reason I think I was good at football

388
00:21:59.14 --> 00:22:00.94
is because I was so damn angry.

389
00:22:00.94 --> 00:22:05.22
And I was a big, fast, strong kid.

390
00:22:06.90 --> 00:22:10.18
And I just literally wanted to hurt everybody I could.

391
00:22:10.18 --> 00:22:11.46
Like it was a way for me to hurt people

392
00:22:11.46 --> 00:22:13.18
and not get in trouble, because like getting in fights,

393
00:22:13.18 --> 00:22:14.98
you know, it's getting trouble for the fights

394
00:22:14.98 --> 00:22:15.82
or most of the time you get in trouble.

395
00:22:15.82 --> 00:22:17.62
How old were you when you started playing football?

396
00:22:19.54 --> 00:22:21.38
Actually, I started in kindergarten.

397
00:22:22.62 --> 00:22:25.66
I played, we lived on this island in the ship channel.

398
00:22:25.66 --> 00:22:26.74
That's where our trailer was.

399
00:22:26.74 --> 00:22:28.66
And it's Kema, Texas is the name of it.

400
00:22:28.66 --> 00:22:31.62
You know, it just now it's like a kind of a Ritzy tourist area.

401
00:22:31.62 --> 00:22:34.98
But it was just like this little blue collar crappy,

402
00:22:34.98 --> 00:22:37.66
did a bunch of shrimp boats and stuff.

403
00:22:37.66 --> 00:22:42.66
And so I lived there, literally my sister and I said,

404
00:22:43.62 --> 00:22:45.38
you're old and I, we walked to school,

405
00:22:45.38 --> 00:22:46.90
crossed these railroad tracks.

406
00:22:46.90 --> 00:22:50.46
And I remember walking to football practice,

407
00:22:50.46 --> 00:22:51.78
walking home from a football game,

408
00:22:51.78 --> 00:22:53.82
like me and my pads, her and her cheerleader outfit.

409
00:22:53.82 --> 00:22:56.38
And we're like walking probably two miles

410
00:22:56.38 --> 00:22:58.94
to school, going across these major roads,

411
00:22:58.94 --> 00:23:00.10
whatever it's like parenting

412
00:23:00.10 --> 00:23:02.34
was a totally different bag back then, right?

413
00:23:02.34 --> 00:23:04.14
But my mom was like, she's surviving.

414
00:23:04.14 --> 00:23:06.06
She's like going to school at night

415
00:23:06.06 --> 00:23:09.50
and or going to school in the day, working at night.

416
00:23:09.50 --> 00:23:11.54
And then her sisters were just kids too, right?

417
00:23:11.54 --> 00:23:13.58
Like her sisters are reasons, but they're 15.

418
00:23:13.58 --> 00:23:15.90
Like we're a 15 year old now.

419
00:23:15.90 --> 00:23:18.30
And like sometimes the 15 year old gets in the car

420
00:23:18.30 --> 00:23:20.26
when the car runs and drives this around and whatever.

421
00:23:20.26 --> 00:23:22.86
So it was a pretty sketchy scene.

422
00:23:23.86 --> 00:23:25.98
And then, you know, in Texas, you can start playing.

423
00:23:25.98 --> 00:23:28.18
So I played what we call dad's club,

424
00:23:28.18 --> 00:23:29.62
Pop Warner out here, right?

425
00:23:30.58 --> 00:23:31.42
I played that.

426
00:23:31.42 --> 00:23:32.26
And then in Texas,

427
00:23:32.26 --> 00:23:34.46
you can start playing for your school in junior high.

428
00:23:34.46 --> 00:23:35.30
Okay.

429
00:23:35.30 --> 00:23:40.30
And I had the head coach in junior high was a former Marine

430
00:23:41.86 --> 00:23:44.02
and he took a liking to me.

431
00:23:44.02 --> 00:23:47.70
And so I did well in junior high football

432
00:23:47.70 --> 00:23:51.18
and then transferred to the really,

433
00:23:51.18 --> 00:23:53.66
a really good football team by our high school.

434
00:23:53.66 --> 00:23:57.10
They're two high schools and Katie,

435
00:23:57.10 --> 00:23:59.50
the one I went to was the newer one.

436
00:23:59.50 --> 00:24:00.82
And they'd only been open a couple of years

437
00:24:00.82 --> 00:24:02.22
when I started it.

438
00:24:02.22 --> 00:24:05.30
But we were going to, we had a great coaching staff

439
00:24:06.38 --> 00:24:11.38
and you know, in Texas, like these dudes are making

440
00:24:12.06 --> 00:24:15.54
big money and like, and they got recruited out to Odessa

441
00:24:15.54 --> 00:24:19.78
my senior year, but really, really good coaching.

442
00:24:19.78 --> 00:24:22.42
And that's what led me into powerlifting

443
00:24:22.42 --> 00:24:25.94
is one of my coaches was a powerlifter.

444
00:24:25.94 --> 00:24:30.38
And he, and I don't know if I was the strongest

445
00:24:30.38 --> 00:24:31.86
in like every lift, but I was,

446
00:24:31.86 --> 00:24:33.34
I was one of the strongest in everything.

447
00:24:33.34 --> 00:24:35.86
And I was the strongest in several of the things.

448
00:24:37.30 --> 00:24:39.54
And so he was, he took a liking to me.

449
00:24:39.54 --> 00:24:42.26
And he's like, I'm gonna teach you how to lift for real

450
00:24:42.26 --> 00:24:43.94
cause you're like, you're just in this football lifting.

451
00:24:43.94 --> 00:24:48.86
And so he taught me like the below parallel squats, right?

452
00:24:48.86 --> 00:24:50.90
And I had to do it with a bar

453
00:24:50.90 --> 00:24:52.78
and then to do a hundred perfect reps before he'd let me

454
00:24:52.78 --> 00:24:53.62
put any weight on.

455
00:24:53.62 --> 00:24:55.10
Damn.

456
00:24:55.10 --> 00:24:56.98
And it took me like a month.

457
00:24:56.98 --> 00:24:59.38
He would sit down next to me and just watching.

458
00:24:59.38 --> 00:25:00.82
Yeah.

459
00:25:00.82 --> 00:25:03.10
Nope. And he'd turn around and walk away.

460
00:25:03.10 --> 00:25:04.10
That was it for the day.

461
00:25:04.10 --> 00:25:05.34
And for the, that was on the second rep.

462
00:25:05.34 --> 00:25:06.18
It was on the second rep.

463
00:25:06.18 --> 00:25:07.18
It was on the 98th rep.

464
00:25:07.18 --> 00:25:08.02
It was the 98th rep.

465
00:25:08.02 --> 00:25:09.38
And they're like, nope.

466
00:25:09.38 --> 00:25:11.38
And then did you, did you have the potential

467
00:25:11.38 --> 00:25:12.42
of playing in college?

468
00:25:16.94 --> 00:25:17.78
I could have played.

469
00:25:17.78 --> 00:25:19.14
I don't, I don't think I would have,

470
00:25:19.14 --> 00:25:20.34
I wouldn't have excelled.

471
00:25:20.34 --> 00:25:21.38
I just wasn't big enough.

472
00:25:21.38 --> 00:25:24.98
I mean, I was, I was, I actually grew a couple inches

473
00:25:24.98 --> 00:25:26.42
in the Navy.

474
00:25:26.42 --> 00:25:31.42
So I, when, when I enlisted at 17, I was five, 11.

475
00:25:32.82 --> 00:25:35.14
I grew like two, six, one somewhere

476
00:25:35.14 --> 00:25:36.10
in the first couple of years.

477
00:25:36.10 --> 00:25:36.94
I don't know.

478
00:25:36.94 --> 00:25:39.94
Did you, how did you hear about the Navy?

479
00:25:41.46 --> 00:25:44.26
Well, and did you, and did you know about the teams?

480
00:25:44.26 --> 00:25:46.14
Yeah. So that's a funny story.

481
00:25:46.14 --> 00:25:51.14
So the recruiter, we had a recruiting office in T and Katie

482
00:25:51.90 --> 00:25:56.90
and the recruiter, the Marine recruiter was a boxer.

483
00:25:56.90 --> 00:26:01.90
And, and my last year of high school, I lived alone,

484
00:26:03.90 --> 00:26:06.42
or I lived in an apartment with, actually with a guy

485
00:26:06.42 --> 00:26:07.26
who enlisted in the gym.

486
00:26:07.26 --> 00:26:10.50
So I split an apartment, but I know where I worked

487
00:26:10.50 --> 00:26:15.22
at a gym as, as like the assistant manager of this gym.

488
00:26:15.22 --> 00:26:20.22
And anyway, and I would box with this Marine recruiter

489
00:26:21.10 --> 00:26:23.34
and you know, Heartbreaker Ridge had already been out.

490
00:26:23.34 --> 00:26:25.14
So it was like, force recon.

491
00:26:25.14 --> 00:26:28.10
And, and I, you know, and I love, like I've always loved

492
00:26:28.10 --> 00:26:29.50
the water, like I've always been like,

493
00:26:29.50 --> 00:26:31.42
I was always a lifeguard and we were always like doing

494
00:26:31.42 --> 00:26:33.78
water sports and going to the beach whenever we could

495
00:26:33.78 --> 00:26:36.58
and all that stuff, working on breath holds

496
00:26:36.58 --> 00:26:37.54
just because it was cool.

497
00:26:37.54 --> 00:26:40.74
In fact, like I would go in a pool and just be so upset

498
00:26:40.74 --> 00:26:41.86
that I had to come up, right?

499
00:26:41.86 --> 00:26:43.38
Cause I like, I'd sit on the bottom of the pool,

500
00:26:43.38 --> 00:26:45.90
like I just want to stay here for like,

501
00:26:45.90 --> 00:26:48.30
and you know, now sort of I knew more of the physiology

502
00:26:48.30 --> 00:26:50.58
of like what I was now like a settling down my nervous system.

503
00:26:50.58 --> 00:26:52.30
Honestly, and I was feeling really good in there.

504
00:26:52.30 --> 00:26:57.30
And so, yeah, so anyway, then I started boxing

505
00:27:00.98 --> 00:27:05.98
with this Marine recruiter and, and this documentary

506
00:27:07.16 --> 00:27:09.42
came out 48 hours.

507
00:27:10.30 --> 00:27:12.94
It's a news documentary show, like it's like 60 minutes,

508
00:27:12.94 --> 00:27:15.18
but it was called 48 hours.

509
00:27:15.18 --> 00:27:18.14
And they followed a budge class, actually,

510
00:27:18.14 --> 00:27:19.62
Krimmins, you remember Krimmins?

511
00:27:19.62 --> 00:27:20.46
Yeah.

512
00:27:20.46 --> 00:27:21.38
So Krimmins was like the star of this.

513
00:27:21.38 --> 00:27:22.50
They're following a budge class.

514
00:27:22.50 --> 00:27:23.34
Okay.

515
00:27:23.34 --> 00:27:24.18
And they,

516
00:27:24.18 --> 00:27:25.02
Was he in the class?

517
00:27:25.02 --> 00:27:25.86
He was in the class.

518
00:27:25.86 --> 00:27:27.66
Like he was, he was the guy, right?

519
00:27:27.66 --> 00:27:29.70
Like he was the one, he was the guy who got all the camera

520
00:27:29.70 --> 00:27:31.70
attention because he was like this salty old,

521
00:27:31.70 --> 00:27:34.86
for sure, fisherman from Boston or something, right?

522
00:27:34.86 --> 00:27:35.74
Somewhere in New England.

523
00:27:35.74 --> 00:27:37.62
And, and they kept saying,

524
00:27:37.62 --> 00:27:39.54
this is the toughest training in the world.

525
00:27:39.54 --> 00:27:40.46
This is the toughest.

526
00:27:40.46 --> 00:27:41.94
And what did I grow up doing?

527
00:27:41.94 --> 00:27:43.14
Like with this abusive stuff out there,

528
00:27:43.14 --> 00:27:44.42
I wanted to be the toughest.

529
00:27:44.42 --> 00:27:46.14
I wanted to be the biggest badass in the world.

530
00:27:46.14 --> 00:27:46.98
Right?

531
00:27:46.98 --> 00:27:47.82
That's what I wanted.

532
00:27:48.90 --> 00:27:50.50
And so I would,

533
00:27:50.50 --> 00:27:52.34
I, I watched that thing,

534
00:27:52.34 --> 00:27:56.86
I recorded on VHS and I watched that thing like 20 times.

535
00:27:56.86 --> 00:28:00.78
And then waited for the Marine recruiter to be out of town.

536
00:28:00.78 --> 00:28:02.34
And I went over to the Navy and talked to him

537
00:28:02.34 --> 00:28:03.38
about being a seal.

538
00:28:03.38 --> 00:28:05.18
What year in high school were you?

539
00:28:06.26 --> 00:28:07.94
Well, it was my fourth year,

540
00:28:07.94 --> 00:28:11.02
but my fourth year I was only a sophomore by credits.

541
00:28:11.02 --> 00:28:11.86
So.

542
00:28:11.86 --> 00:28:13.98
Was that cause you just were failing everything?

543
00:28:13.98 --> 00:28:14.82
What was going on?

544
00:28:14.82 --> 00:28:18.42
I started failing classes as soon as my mom got remarried

545
00:28:18.42 --> 00:28:19.70
and I got in that world.

546
00:28:19.70 --> 00:28:23.74
Like when you have screaming, fighting

547
00:28:23.74 --> 00:28:26.98
and cops over at your house all the time, it's like,

548
00:28:26.98 --> 00:28:28.86
you know, and I'm grounded all the time at home

549
00:28:28.86 --> 00:28:31.14
and he's abusive and I'm obviously like hiding from,

550
00:28:31.14 --> 00:28:32.14
like, and it just,

551
00:28:32.14 --> 00:28:33.34
I wasn't going to be doing homework.

552
00:28:33.34 --> 00:28:35.54
And then like my sympathetic nervous system

553
00:28:35.54 --> 00:28:36.78
was ramped up to hell.

554
00:28:36.78 --> 00:28:39.66
Like I'm, I'm in fight or flight kind of all the time

555
00:28:39.66 --> 00:28:40.50
being home.

556
00:28:41.78 --> 00:28:44.74
And so, yeah, I,

557
00:28:48.30 --> 00:28:52.30
I, whatever, I, I, I was a screwed up.

558
00:28:52.30 --> 00:28:53.86
I was a super screwed up kid.

559
00:28:54.90 --> 00:28:57.18
But anyway, so Bivens out of town,

560
00:28:57.18 --> 00:29:00.30
I went and talked to the Navy recruiter

561
00:29:00.30 --> 00:29:02.46
and he's like, I've never put in a seal before.

562
00:29:02.46 --> 00:29:03.94
I don't know, I'll look into it.

563
00:29:03.94 --> 00:29:06.78
And that they just started the delayed entry program.

564
00:29:06.78 --> 00:29:11.78
So that started literally months before I signed up.

565
00:29:11.94 --> 00:29:13.30
So I told my mom what I wanted to do.

566
00:29:13.30 --> 00:29:14.14
And she's like, all right.

567
00:29:14.14 --> 00:29:15.46
So she signed off when I went on 17.

568
00:29:15.46 --> 00:29:17.02
She's like, cool, off the payroll.

569
00:29:17.02 --> 00:29:17.86
Yeah.

570
00:29:17.86 --> 00:29:18.78
And yes.

571
00:29:18.78 --> 00:29:21.82
So anyway, yeah, I, so from like third grade

572
00:29:21.82 --> 00:29:23.46
through four years of high school,

573
00:29:24.66 --> 00:29:27.26
I don't, I'd never really legitimately passed any class

574
00:29:27.26 --> 00:29:28.78
unless the teacher liked me.

575
00:29:28.78 --> 00:29:32.70
And then everybody starts telling you what a moron you are

576
00:29:32.70 --> 00:29:35.30
and you're afraid of people finding out.

577
00:29:35.30 --> 00:29:36.86
So you're like, you know, I don't,

578
00:29:36.86 --> 00:29:39.42
I want to call any attention to my stupidity.

579
00:29:39.42 --> 00:29:40.54
So I'm just like being quiet.

580
00:29:40.54 --> 00:29:43.30
And like, and so nobody, like none of my friends knew

581
00:29:43.30 --> 00:29:44.58
that I was behind in high school.

582
00:29:44.58 --> 00:29:45.82
Like none of my, none of my friends knew

583
00:29:45.82 --> 00:29:47.34
that I wasn't going to graduate.

584
00:29:47.34 --> 00:29:49.06
I knew I wasn't going to graduate

585
00:29:49.06 --> 00:29:51.02
because I wasn't going to stick around for two or three

586
00:29:51.02 --> 00:29:54.14
or four years to get through high school, obviously.

587
00:29:54.14 --> 00:29:56.58
And so when I joined, I was just like, you know,

588
00:29:56.58 --> 00:29:58.22
at some point I'm going to go to GED.

589
00:29:58.22 --> 00:30:01.22
And then, and then I took the ASFAB

590
00:30:01.22 --> 00:30:05.50
and actually did decent on that.

591
00:30:05.50 --> 00:30:11.50
And yeah, so I joined, and I didn't tell,

592
00:30:11.50 --> 00:30:13.10
I still didn't tell the Marine Corps,

593
00:30:13.10 --> 00:30:15.34
because I was like, Fred, you're just going to be so pissed off

594
00:30:15.34 --> 00:30:16.90
of me.

595
00:30:16.90 --> 00:30:21.34
And then, yeah, just like a month,

596
00:30:21.34 --> 00:30:22.78
we had all these street parties, you know,

597
00:30:22.78 --> 00:30:25.54
like vacant streets, you'd go,

598
00:30:25.54 --> 00:30:26.98
park our cars, turn our lights on,

599
00:30:26.98 --> 00:30:28.78
have keg parties and whatever.

600
00:30:28.78 --> 00:30:32.54
And it was always a mix of the high schools

601
00:30:32.54 --> 00:30:34.10
and there's always some friction

602
00:30:34.10 --> 00:30:36.22
because we were rivals, you know, in sports.

603
00:30:36.22 --> 00:30:39.90
And so about a month after I joined,

604
00:30:39.90 --> 00:30:43.62
about a month after my Marine career found out

605
00:30:43.62 --> 00:30:47.66
that I joined, I think it was a couple of months

606
00:30:47.66 --> 00:30:53.86
after I joined, I tried to break up a fight

607
00:30:53.86 --> 00:30:56.82
and the students swung on me and like graced me.

608
00:30:56.82 --> 00:31:00.50
I had decent enough head movement together

609
00:31:00.50 --> 00:31:02.30
the way everybody like graced me.

610
00:31:02.30 --> 00:31:05.78
And I was such an angry rage ball and so arrogant.

611
00:31:07.78 --> 00:31:10.98
I was maximally offended that somebody tried to this.

612
00:31:10.98 --> 00:31:13.46
I'm like, who the fuck do you think you are?

613
00:31:13.46 --> 00:31:16.02
So I try to look at the guy just bewildered

614
00:31:16.02 --> 00:31:17.94
and I guess there's something in my eyes

615
00:31:17.94 --> 00:31:21.78
that made him realize that he took off running.

616
00:31:21.78 --> 00:31:23.14
And so I took off running after him

617
00:31:23.14 --> 00:31:25.10
and I fucking body slammed him down the street

618
00:31:25.10 --> 00:31:26.46
and punch him in one of his buddies

619
00:31:26.46 --> 00:31:27.90
come and I should be beating his ass

620
00:31:27.90 --> 00:31:29.98
and I beat up these two guys, right?

621
00:31:29.98 --> 00:31:32.02
And just one guy, he's curled up in the fetal position

622
00:31:32.02 --> 00:31:33.18
and I'm picking him up by his ears

623
00:31:33.18 --> 00:31:34.54
and telling him to fight and he won't,

624
00:31:34.54 --> 00:31:35.58
not like just spitting his face.

625
00:31:35.58 --> 00:31:38.10
Like I was angry, nasty dude.

626
00:31:38.10 --> 00:31:43.10
And anyway, and so I pull up to see my Marine recruiter,

627
00:31:44.50 --> 00:31:46.02
or to see the Navy recruiter,

628
00:31:46.02 --> 00:31:47.86
I pull up to the recruiting office a few days later

629
00:31:47.86 --> 00:31:51.38
and the Marine recruiter comes out and says,

630
00:31:51.38 --> 00:31:54.26
so what's this I hear about you beating up on my Marines?

631
00:31:54.26 --> 00:31:56.66
And I'm like, huh?

632
00:31:56.66 --> 00:32:00.82
Yeah, so anyway, so I walked that thing over and over again,

633
00:32:00.82 --> 00:32:03.10
wanted to do toughest training in the world,

634
00:32:03.10 --> 00:32:05.86
went and joined, I didn't know what a seal was.

635
00:32:08.18 --> 00:32:09.62
I didn't even, I didn't know what a seal was

636
00:32:09.62 --> 00:32:11.14
when I was in Buds.

637
00:32:11.14 --> 00:32:13.54
I wanted to do the toughest training in the world.

638
00:32:13.54 --> 00:32:16.66
And yeah, I gradually learned more and more,

639
00:32:16.66 --> 00:32:17.50
but I still didn't know.

640
00:32:17.50 --> 00:32:21.18
Like when, I don't know if they did it when you went through,

641
00:32:21.18 --> 00:32:23.90
if you were a couple of years after me, I think, right?

642
00:32:23.90 --> 00:32:25.42
But they used to take us around

643
00:32:25.42 --> 00:32:26.46
all the different SEAL teams

644
00:32:26.46 --> 00:32:27.78
and then you had to rank choice,

645
00:32:27.78 --> 00:32:30.06
like the team, and you had to rank choice to the East Coast,

646
00:32:30.06 --> 00:32:32.66
well, also without visiting any of those.

647
00:32:33.94 --> 00:32:35.82
And I remember like when they started taking us around

648
00:32:35.82 --> 00:32:38.26
to the teams right before graduation,

649
00:32:38.26 --> 00:32:39.50
remember it kind of hitting me that,

650
00:32:39.50 --> 00:32:42.58
oh, I don't actually know what this used to do.

651
00:32:42.58 --> 00:32:45.18
Oh, here's how naive I was.

652
00:32:45.18 --> 00:32:46.78
So you remember the delayed entry program

653
00:32:46.78 --> 00:32:49.06
gave people three chances of passing the test.

654
00:32:49.06 --> 00:32:49.90
Okay.

655
00:32:49.90 --> 00:32:53.42
Okay, so you could take the PRT and if you passed it,

656
00:32:53.42 --> 00:32:56.90
you were guaranteed to go to Buds first.

657
00:32:56.90 --> 00:32:58.18
Because remember the way it was before,

658
00:32:58.18 --> 00:32:59.26
you could pass the PRT,

659
00:32:59.26 --> 00:33:03.74
but then your gaining command had to agree

660
00:33:03.74 --> 00:33:05.62
to let you go to Buds instead of coming to them,

661
00:33:05.62 --> 00:33:06.90
which almost never happened, right?

662
00:33:06.90 --> 00:33:08.78
So you had to go to the fleet for a couple of years

663
00:33:08.78 --> 00:33:09.62
to come back.

664
00:33:09.62 --> 00:33:11.14
So the delayed entry program was all about,

665
00:33:11.14 --> 00:33:12.94
if you passed the PRT, you'd definitely go

666
00:33:12.94 --> 00:33:14.98
and it gives you three chances to pass the PRT

667
00:33:14.98 --> 00:33:17.62
and then you get like some sort of promotion

668
00:33:17.62 --> 00:33:20.46
out of bootcamp, promotion out of A-School.

669
00:33:20.46 --> 00:33:25.46
And so, yeah, so I took the test

670
00:33:25.46 --> 00:33:29.74
and I remember his name was Petty Officer Winkler,

671
00:33:29.74 --> 00:33:32.74
he was the first class, he was a Vietnam Air Seal,

672
00:33:32.74 --> 00:33:35.26
like all Vietnam Air Seals, super cool guy.

673
00:33:35.26 --> 00:33:39.10
And so they had like a morning training

674
00:33:39.10 --> 00:33:41.18
for people who failed the test

675
00:33:41.18 --> 00:33:42.42
to go in and work on the swimming,

676
00:33:42.42 --> 00:33:45.38
work out, like whatever they weren't gonna go work out.

677
00:33:45.38 --> 00:33:47.18
So you had to get up a couple of hours earlier

678
00:33:47.18 --> 00:33:48.62
an hour earlier and you could go

679
00:33:48.62 --> 00:33:52.18
and they excused you from a little bit of your time

680
00:33:52.18 --> 00:33:54.94
at the, in your regular bootcamp company

681
00:33:54.94 --> 00:33:57.46
because we didn't have our own stuff back then, as you know.

682
00:33:57.46 --> 00:34:02.46
And so I just smoked the PRT and Winkler really liked me

683
00:34:03.10 --> 00:34:05.38
and he's like, hey, you should come in the mornings

684
00:34:05.38 --> 00:34:07.38
and you can coach guys.

685
00:34:07.38 --> 00:34:08.74
Cause obviously it worked at a gym

686
00:34:08.74 --> 00:34:12.18
and I was like sort of a personal trainer and stuff anyway.

687
00:34:12.18 --> 00:34:15.86
So I was doing that and then got to be really good friends

688
00:34:15.86 --> 00:34:18.30
with him and the other seal motivator.

689
00:34:18.30 --> 00:34:22.50
And after I coached people in the mornings,

690
00:34:22.50 --> 00:34:25.10
I'd end up sitting in their office shooting the shit.

691
00:34:25.10 --> 00:34:27.74
They'd be drinking coffee, I didn't drink coffee.

692
00:34:27.74 --> 00:34:30.50
And he said something about dive pay

693
00:34:30.50 --> 00:34:32.18
or hazard duty pay or something.

694
00:34:32.18 --> 00:34:33.86
And I was like, what's that?

695
00:34:33.86 --> 00:34:36.02
And he starts explaining it to me.

696
00:34:36.02 --> 00:34:37.74
And this light bulb goes off in my head.

697
00:34:37.74 --> 00:34:40.78
I'm like, I'm gonna get paid?

698
00:34:40.78 --> 00:34:45.14
And he thought that was the funniest damn thing

699
00:34:45.14 --> 00:34:45.98
he'd ever heard.

700
00:34:45.98 --> 00:34:47.74
So he took me around to every office.

701
00:34:47.74 --> 00:34:49.78
Like, tell them what you just said to me.

702
00:34:49.78 --> 00:34:54.78
And so I literally, I was just a dumb kid.

703
00:34:55.74 --> 00:34:57.14
Like I just wanted to go do this training.

704
00:34:57.14 --> 00:34:58.66
I didn't know it was gonna get paid.

705
00:34:58.66 --> 00:35:00.78
Like, why are you gonna pay me?

706
00:35:00.78 --> 00:35:02.70
Cause right now you're giving me a place to live,

707
00:35:02.70 --> 00:35:04.30
you're giving me clothes and then there's a chow hall.

708
00:35:04.30 --> 00:35:06.30
Like, what do I need money for?

709
00:35:06.30 --> 00:35:08.34
I figure, like I'm just gonna be training

710
00:35:08.34 --> 00:35:09.74
to kill people or going to kill people.

711
00:35:09.74 --> 00:35:11.38
And what else am I gonna do?

712
00:35:11.38 --> 00:35:12.30
Why do I need money?

713
00:35:12.30 --> 00:35:15.82
I didn't think about people having families and kids.

714
00:35:15.82 --> 00:35:16.94
Like, you know, you just think like,

715
00:35:16.94 --> 00:35:18.26
oh, there are guys in the military.

716
00:35:18.26 --> 00:35:19.10
That's what he does.

717
00:35:19.10 --> 00:35:19.94
That's all he does.

718
00:35:19.94 --> 00:35:22.26
I had a similar, I was in my first platoon.

719
00:35:22.26 --> 00:35:23.26
I think it was my first platoon.

720
00:35:23.26 --> 00:35:26.22
Or whenever I got paid per diem for the first time.

721
00:35:26.22 --> 00:35:28.26
Like they had to explain it to me a couple times.

722
00:35:28.26 --> 00:35:30.26
You know, you're getting, like,

723
00:35:30.26 --> 00:35:31.42
that was a wild concept.

724
00:35:31.42 --> 00:35:34.70
Okay, you're going to the desert and here's $1400.

725
00:35:34.70 --> 00:35:36.58
And I'm like, what's this for?

726
00:35:36.58 --> 00:35:37.86
And they're like, for your food.

727
00:35:37.86 --> 00:35:39.46
And I not only make a thousand bucks a month,

728
00:35:39.46 --> 00:35:40.78
they give me $1400.

729
00:35:40.78 --> 00:35:44.22
So you're like, wait, but I mean,

730
00:35:44.22 --> 00:35:46.34
what about when I'm not in the desert?

731
00:35:46.34 --> 00:35:47.18
I still got to buy food there.

732
00:35:47.18 --> 00:35:48.02
But yeah, but when you're there,

733
00:35:48.02 --> 00:35:49.22
we're going to give you money to buy your food.

734
00:35:49.22 --> 00:35:52.30
I'm like, okay, I'll take it.

735
00:35:52.30 --> 00:35:54.94
It took a while to comprehend that the whole thing.

736
00:35:54.94 --> 00:35:57.90
When you got to Buds, was there any challenges

737
00:35:57.90 --> 00:35:58.74
for you at Buds?

738
00:35:59.70 --> 00:36:01.02
Yeah, the runs.

739
00:36:02.22 --> 00:36:03.54
I was a, I was a-

740
00:36:03.54 --> 00:36:04.90
What did you weigh?

741
00:36:04.90 --> 00:36:05.74
230.

742
00:36:06.54 --> 00:36:07.94
Yeah.

743
00:36:07.94 --> 00:36:10.30
And not a fast runner.

744
00:36:11.18 --> 00:36:12.50
I was a great sprinter.

745
00:36:12.50 --> 00:36:13.34
Yeah.

746
00:36:13.34 --> 00:36:14.18
You know, I was a fast twitch.

747
00:36:14.18 --> 00:36:16.02
You're just like fast twitched human.

748
00:36:16.02 --> 00:36:19.34
And like when we did Frog Hill.

749
00:36:19.34 --> 00:36:20.50
Dude, I remember one time I was talking to you,

750
00:36:20.50 --> 00:36:23.06
and you're like, I thought you're like,

751
00:36:23.06 --> 00:36:25.06
oh, what you, I mean, you're deadlifting that.

752
00:36:25.06 --> 00:36:27.98
And I was like, dude, I can like, I deadlift.

753
00:36:27.98 --> 00:36:30.58
The most I've ever deadlifted is like 505 or something.

754
00:36:30.58 --> 00:36:32.42
And you looked at me like I was scum.

755
00:36:32.42 --> 00:36:36.26
I was like, damn, that hurt, bro.

756
00:36:38.34 --> 00:36:40.34
So yeah, you're all fast twitching.

757
00:36:40.34 --> 00:36:41.70
So the runs kicked your ass.

758
00:36:41.70 --> 00:36:43.18
Yeah.

759
00:36:43.18 --> 00:36:44.82
I struggled and I knew I would.

760
00:36:44.82 --> 00:36:46.46
Cause I, I mean, I struggled in preparation.

761
00:36:46.46 --> 00:36:49.78
So when I first decided to join the Navy,

762
00:36:51.38 --> 00:36:54.70
the Marine recruiter actually talked to a seal

763
00:36:54.70 --> 00:36:57.18
and had the, and had the guy talk to me.

764
00:36:57.18 --> 00:36:59.38
So I had a phone call with the guy.

765
00:36:59.38 --> 00:37:01.74
And, and he said,

766
00:37:03.58 --> 00:37:04.86
well, it sounds like your biggest problem

767
00:37:04.86 --> 00:37:05.70
is going to be running.

768
00:37:05.70 --> 00:37:08.14
Cause I'd, all they'd done it, like I ran track and field,

769
00:37:08.14 --> 00:37:11.34
but I did like, I, the furthest,

770
00:37:11.34 --> 00:37:14.50
I, the furthest I ever ran was 400 yards,

771
00:37:14.50 --> 00:37:15.34
400 meters, right?

772
00:37:15.34 --> 00:37:18.26
Like that was the furthest I'd ever run in my life.

773
00:37:18.26 --> 00:37:20.74
I'd never done a mile on a track.

774
00:37:20.74 --> 00:37:21.94
Never.

775
00:37:21.94 --> 00:37:24.70
And so, and I hated that.

776
00:37:24.70 --> 00:37:25.54
Like in football,

777
00:37:25.54 --> 00:37:28.06
and to be like, take a lap to warm up, right?

778
00:37:28.06 --> 00:37:29.42
I'm like, I'm smoke.

779
00:37:29.42 --> 00:37:31.14
So like, what do you mean warm up?

780
00:37:31.14 --> 00:37:32.06
Like I'm done.

781
00:37:32.06 --> 00:37:34.26
Like a, come back from a lab.

782
00:37:34.26 --> 00:37:35.62
Well, what are you kidding me?

783
00:37:35.62 --> 00:37:39.10
And unfortunately my son inherited that from me.

784
00:37:39.10 --> 00:37:42.94
So this, this seal sold me.

785
00:37:42.94 --> 00:37:44.46
So the biggest problem for you is going to be to run.

786
00:37:44.46 --> 00:37:46.38
You need to be running like 10 miles a day.

787
00:37:46.38 --> 00:37:49.10
I'm like, I don't really, okay.

788
00:37:49.10 --> 00:37:51.34
So I'm like, I don't know where I'm going to run 10 miles.

789
00:37:51.34 --> 00:37:53.70
So I go out in the, like the main street,

790
00:37:53.70 --> 00:37:55.74
that's all the one that gets from the freeway down to my town.

791
00:37:55.74 --> 00:37:57.78
And it goes several miles the other way.

792
00:37:57.78 --> 00:38:01.62
So I clocked it off in my car and it's five miles.

793
00:38:01.62 --> 00:38:03.10
I'm like, well, I'm just going to run down to the end

794
00:38:03.10 --> 00:38:05.34
of this thing and back 10 miles a day.

795
00:38:05.34 --> 00:38:06.74
I didn't even have any shoes.

796
00:38:06.74 --> 00:38:08.42
Like I, I owned like one pair of shoes.

797
00:38:08.42 --> 00:38:09.30
They were like top-siders.

798
00:38:09.30 --> 00:38:13.38
And so I just ran barefoot down concrete streets.

799
00:38:13.38 --> 00:38:16.66
I'd start running 10 miles a day and I did it.

800
00:38:16.66 --> 00:38:18.94
I mean, I'm sure I didn't do it every day,

801
00:38:18.94 --> 00:38:23.02
but I like my memory is it's like, I just did it every day.

802
00:38:23.02 --> 00:38:28.02
And then when I got, and I, and then I started timing myself

803
00:38:30.62 --> 00:38:31.82
in the mile and a half because right,

804
00:38:31.82 --> 00:38:34.54
we had the PRT and I knew I had to hit a certain time.

805
00:38:34.54 --> 00:38:36.34
And that, that I didn't regret it.

806
00:38:36.34 --> 00:38:40.42
Like I probably, I probably only beat that qualification time

807
00:38:40.42 --> 00:38:43.50
like 30 seconds, 20 seconds, something like that.

808
00:38:44.74 --> 00:38:47.46
Like when I, and then when I went to a school,

809
00:38:47.46 --> 00:38:50.18
I really focused on running a lot.

810
00:38:51.22 --> 00:38:53.06
And I did like a couple of 10 Ks.

811
00:38:53.06 --> 00:38:55.26
And I, I got to where it's running like six and a half

812
00:38:55.26 --> 00:38:58.86
minute miles and 10 issues and shorts on a road on the street.

813
00:38:58.86 --> 00:38:59.70
Right.

814
00:38:59.70 --> 00:39:01.70
So I think the cutoff time in about like seven and a half

815
00:39:01.70 --> 00:39:04.78
minutes or something and pants and boots on the sand.

816
00:39:04.78 --> 00:39:06.86
So it was, it was all I could do.

817
00:39:06.86 --> 00:39:08.90
I mean, I was always in the Goon squad,

818
00:39:08.90 --> 00:39:11.22
I was in the Goon squad, every run I was in the Goon squad.

819
00:39:11.22 --> 00:39:12.78
But it was almost always the first guy out

820
00:39:12.78 --> 00:39:16.06
because it was like bear crawl races or sprints or like

821
00:39:16.06 --> 00:39:16.90
something like that.

822
00:39:16.90 --> 00:39:18.78
And like, hey, that's my bag, baby.

823
00:39:18.78 --> 00:39:21.18
In fact, you remember Frog Hill out of the island.

824
00:39:21.18 --> 00:39:22.02
Yep.

825
00:39:22.02 --> 00:39:23.70
It's like you had to do pull ups before the meal

826
00:39:23.70 --> 00:39:25.34
or you had to do Frog Hill.

827
00:39:25.34 --> 00:39:30.18
I was so fast at Frog Hill and I, and I like anybody else.

828
00:39:30.18 --> 00:39:32.06
I'm going through Bud's scared to death that I'm getting

829
00:39:32.06 --> 00:39:35.10
kicked out every, every day, every day, like every second.

830
00:39:35.10 --> 00:39:36.58
It's like they're about to figure out,

831
00:39:36.58 --> 00:39:39.10
I'm a machine here and I'm getting tossed, right?

832
00:39:39.10 --> 00:39:42.58
And so I just like a real, just keep your head down.

833
00:39:42.58 --> 00:39:45.14
Like the most humble time of my life was, was Bud's

834
00:39:45.14 --> 00:39:48.06
and I wasn't going to bring any attention to myself.

835
00:39:48.06 --> 00:39:51.18
And I don't think I really realized I did it

836
00:39:51.18 --> 00:39:53.30
because I think they had kind of groups or something.

837
00:39:53.30 --> 00:39:57.54
And I, I mean, I just smoked everybody in my class.

838
00:39:57.54 --> 00:40:00.34
Like I, I think I was, I was almost all the way back down

839
00:40:00.34 --> 00:40:02.58
before anybody got to the top.

840
00:40:02.58 --> 00:40:05.30
And so then there's this one instructor who decided

841
00:40:05.30 --> 00:40:06.66
I must be sandbagging the runs

842
00:40:06.66 --> 00:40:08.34
because look how good he is at running, right?

843
00:40:08.34 --> 00:40:10.78
And so, so he just turned on me and like, you know,

844
00:40:10.78 --> 00:40:12.54
it's just beat down boy.

845
00:40:12.54 --> 00:40:15.66
And then they got to where they were dropping me

846
00:40:15.66 --> 00:40:17.50
for pushups when they started the class

847
00:40:17.50 --> 00:40:19.66
and I still had to meet the time.

848
00:40:19.66 --> 00:40:20.66
And then after a while I was like,

849
00:40:20.66 --> 00:40:22.58
you have to beat everybody or you're still going

850
00:40:22.58 --> 00:40:23.82
to the surf zone.

851
00:40:23.82 --> 00:40:26.34
So I had to, what was the second phase?

852
00:40:26.34 --> 00:40:27.78
Like 40 pushups or something?

853
00:40:27.78 --> 00:40:28.78
I don't know, I don't remember.

854
00:40:28.78 --> 00:40:30.98
I think it's, I think it's like 20, 40, 60 or something

855
00:40:30.98 --> 00:40:31.82
like that.

856
00:40:31.82 --> 00:40:32.66
That's probably the phases.

857
00:40:32.66 --> 00:40:33.82
And so whatever it was in second phase,

858
00:40:33.82 --> 00:40:35.70
I had to do the pushups and then I sprint

859
00:40:35.70 --> 00:40:37.18
and I would still win.

860
00:40:37.18 --> 00:40:40.30
And like, I was really good at that.

861
00:40:40.30 --> 00:40:42.02
And I just sucked it at the run.

862
00:40:42.02 --> 00:40:44.50
And you'd barely passed the four mile time runs?

863
00:40:44.50 --> 00:40:45.62
Barely.

864
00:40:45.62 --> 00:40:49.66
I mean, every run was like five, four, three,

865
00:40:49.66 --> 00:40:51.34
and me diving across the finish line.

866
00:40:51.34 --> 00:40:55.22
Like, I mean, in fact, one of the instructors,

867
00:40:55.22 --> 00:40:57.62
because I was pretty good at everything else.

868
00:40:57.62 --> 00:40:58.86
Like some of the calisthenics stuff,

869
00:40:58.86 --> 00:41:00.38
like flutter kicks forever, like I wouldn't,

870
00:41:00.38 --> 00:41:02.22
like that's just too enduring for me.

871
00:41:02.22 --> 00:41:06.50
Like I couldn't, but, but I was always like,

872
00:41:09.62 --> 00:41:11.06
I'm pretty sure it's the biggest,

873
00:41:11.06 --> 00:41:13.06
but I was definitely like one of the top two.

874
00:41:13.06 --> 00:41:15.34
Yeah, two threes, a big dude to be going through.

875
00:41:15.34 --> 00:41:18.34
Well, I finished at 185.

876
00:41:18.34 --> 00:41:20.06
Oh, damn.

877
00:41:20.06 --> 00:41:22.58
And they, I started buds at 174.

878
00:41:22.58 --> 00:41:24.46
I graduated buds at 185.

879
00:41:24.46 --> 00:41:25.30
Holy.

880
00:41:25.30 --> 00:41:26.62
So you and I met in the middle.

881
00:41:26.62 --> 00:41:27.46
Yeah.

882
00:41:27.46 --> 00:41:30.66
I think they called me like the cyborg gorilla or something.

883
00:41:30.66 --> 00:41:34.42
Cause like I lost all my muscle mass in my torso,

884
00:41:34.42 --> 00:41:36.22
but my arms didn't get smaller.

885
00:41:36.22 --> 00:41:38.46
So I looked like a gorilla.

886
00:41:38.46 --> 00:41:40.58
Like I was just, I was just a weird looking thing.

887
00:41:40.58 --> 00:41:43.22
But you know, I could do like anybody, like you graduate buds,

888
00:41:43.22 --> 00:41:45.30
I could do like 600 pushups in a row.

889
00:41:45.30 --> 00:41:46.62
Right?

890
00:41:46.62 --> 00:41:50.54
Now I remember going to the gym the first time after buds

891
00:41:51.86 --> 00:41:53.66
and I couldn't bench two plates.

892
00:41:54.70 --> 00:41:58.38
And I was literally, I almost cried.

893
00:41:58.38 --> 00:42:00.22
Like I was sitting there going, oh God.

894
00:42:00.22 --> 00:42:02.10
Like I had tears rolling up in my eyes.

895
00:42:02.10 --> 00:42:03.90
I was like, I could go outside.

896
00:42:03.90 --> 00:42:05.94
And I like, oh my God.

897
00:42:05.94 --> 00:42:09.10
You know, cause I mean, I wasn't super strong,

898
00:42:09.10 --> 00:42:11.82
but I was, I mean, definitely like well into the 300s

899
00:42:11.82 --> 00:42:12.98
in high school, right?

900
00:42:12.98 --> 00:42:14.74
So I expected to be stronger.

901
00:42:14.74 --> 00:42:17.14
And I'm like, I can't bench my body weight.

902
00:42:17.14 --> 00:42:18.22
Right?

903
00:42:18.22 --> 00:42:19.78
I'm weak.

904
00:42:19.78 --> 00:42:22.34
But it all, yeah, obviously it comes back pretty fast.

905
00:42:22.34 --> 00:42:23.66
Yeah.

906
00:42:23.66 --> 00:42:25.42
Do you remember when they started talking

907
00:42:25.42 --> 00:42:27.78
about medium twitch muscle?

908
00:42:27.78 --> 00:42:30.18
Do you remember the timeframe that that happened?

909
00:42:30.18 --> 00:42:32.38
Because I remember reading about.

910
00:42:32.38 --> 00:42:34.30
Intermediate fibers man?

911
00:42:34.30 --> 00:42:35.30
I guess maybe.

912
00:42:35.30 --> 00:42:37.06
I just remember I was never,

913
00:42:37.06 --> 00:42:38.86
I wasn't like the fastest guy,

914
00:42:38.86 --> 00:42:41.46
but I wasn't like the most endurance guy.

915
00:42:41.46 --> 00:42:44.02
So I'm like the loser that I couldn't win a sprint

916
00:42:44.02 --> 00:42:45.62
and I couldn't run, I couldn't win

917
00:42:45.62 --> 00:42:47.10
the freaking four mile time run.

918
00:42:47.10 --> 00:42:48.26
Right.

919
00:42:48.26 --> 00:42:50.26
And I figured out eventually when I started hearing

920
00:42:50.26 --> 00:42:52.22
about like intermediate twitch muscle,

921
00:42:52.22 --> 00:42:54.38
that there's certain people that have this thing

922
00:42:54.38 --> 00:42:55.34
and that was me.

923
00:42:55.34 --> 00:42:56.18
And I was like, oh yeah.

924
00:42:56.18 --> 00:42:58.66
Cause like I could put on a rucksack and just go forever.

925
00:42:58.66 --> 00:42:59.98
Right.

926
00:42:59.98 --> 00:43:01.18
And then when I did jujitsu,

927
00:43:01.18 --> 00:43:03.82
like I have really good endurance.

928
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:05.14
Yeah.

929
00:43:05.14 --> 00:43:06.42
Have you seen me get tired?

930
00:43:06.42 --> 00:43:07.26
No.

931
00:43:07.26 --> 00:43:08.94
So I've been training with him for like 10 years.

932
00:43:08.94 --> 00:43:09.90
Never seen me get tired.

933
00:43:09.90 --> 00:43:10.90
I remember training with you

934
00:43:10.90 --> 00:43:12.06
and like watching you roll guys

935
00:43:12.06 --> 00:43:14.34
and you just had like sweat pouring off of it.

936
00:43:14.34 --> 00:43:15.34
Yeah.

937
00:43:15.34 --> 00:43:17.22
Like breathing through your nose

938
00:43:17.22 --> 00:43:19.94
and like just calmly mashing people.

939
00:43:19.94 --> 00:43:22.62
I'm like, that killed me in jits.

940
00:43:22.62 --> 00:43:25.38
Like I, cause I mean I'm good for like three minutes.

941
00:43:25.38 --> 00:43:29.78
I'm then if my, if I haven't won in three minutes,

942
00:43:29.78 --> 00:43:35.78
Like by the time when you do like three minute rounds or whatever after class by the time

943
00:43:35.78 --> 00:43:38.94
I get to like I mean I might as well be rolling with the five-year-old girl because I have

944
00:43:38.94 --> 00:43:41.22
nothing I have no strength whatsoever.

945
00:43:41.22 --> 00:43:42.22
Yeah, yeah.

946
00:43:42.22 --> 00:43:48.94
But I just didn't have that that explosive you know again like max deadlift like I'd

947
00:43:48.94 --> 00:43:51.78
be embarrassed to be like dude I'm just pathetic.

948
00:43:51.78 --> 00:43:52.78
Yeah.

949
00:43:52.78 --> 00:43:53.78
And that's just the way it is.

950
00:43:53.78 --> 00:43:57.50
I mean it's just a different you get you get your certain genetic thing and that's what

951
00:43:57.50 --> 00:43:59.98
you're going to you can work on it a little bit.

952
00:43:59.98 --> 00:44:00.98
Yeah.

953
00:44:00.98 --> 00:44:03.62
You can get to do a lot of push-ups instead of a lot of bench I guess apparently.

954
00:44:03.62 --> 00:44:04.62
Yeah, yeah.

955
00:44:04.62 --> 00:44:05.62
Yeah.

956
00:44:05.62 --> 00:44:12.94
Well I mean you I mean nobody nobody is like 100% of any fiber right and like in different

957
00:44:12.94 --> 00:44:18.14
muscles of your body you're going to have different makeup supplements so like everybody

958
00:44:18.14 --> 00:44:23.18
everybody couldn't train to some degree to get better at reasonably good at something

959
00:44:23.18 --> 00:44:25.98
if you really weren't it's just like any it's like your mental aptitude.

960
00:44:25.98 --> 00:44:29.30
But like you would have 0% chance of being a good marathon runner.

961
00:44:29.30 --> 00:44:30.30
Yeah.

962
00:44:30.30 --> 00:44:36.22
You here's how smart I am though when I was in medical school and residency I knew that

963
00:44:36.22 --> 00:44:42.42
the smart thing to do then was to start doing triathlons because I was going to get good

964
00:44:42.42 --> 00:44:47.94
at this damn endurance thing finally right so when I was in college I worked full time

965
00:44:47.94 --> 00:44:52.90
and I went to school I worked part time and but it is a lot of it for part time it's like

966
00:44:52.90 --> 00:44:58.38
30 hours a week and then I went to school full time and you know for half of it I was

967
00:44:58.38 --> 00:45:04.74
married and had kids and whatever so like I was burning the candle at both ends you

968
00:45:04.74 --> 00:45:11.62
know staying up late for get papers and whatever finals and all that and so all I really had

969
00:45:11.62 --> 00:45:16.46
time to do was run so I'd come home and I ran and it started like running three miles

970
00:45:16.46 --> 00:45:20.62
and then it's four and then it's five and then six and then I said you know I'm going

971
00:45:20.62 --> 00:45:25.98
to do a marathon because you know whatever I've never been good at endurance I'm going

972
00:45:25.98 --> 00:45:33.58
to get good at endurance so I did a marathon brutal like I have the type of endurance where

973
00:45:33.58 --> 00:45:39.86
like if I go slow I can go forever but I don't I can't go fast like if I go fast and I go

974
00:45:39.86 --> 00:45:45.02
if I go anaerobic once and hit like that black gas or threshold like I'm done like I'm done

975
00:45:45.02 --> 00:45:50.06
in fact I did that on one of the triathlons so it's anyway I did that and then I started

976
00:45:50.06 --> 00:45:54.26
doing well I'm going to do triathlons and so I started with the super frog did you how

977
00:45:54.26 --> 00:45:57.46
much weight did you have to lose a bunch of weight or did you lose weight or you're not

978
00:45:57.46 --> 00:46:03.70
or just go Clydesdale yeah it's doing Clydesdale and something happened to me at some point

979
00:46:03.70 --> 00:46:09.58
my life is after the teams so it was during college I think my body weight like settled

980
00:46:09.58 --> 00:46:16.26
out around 240 give or take five pounds right nothing I did change that and to this day nothing

981
00:46:16.26 --> 00:46:22.06
changes that I can starve myself like I can lose weight for a little while but like give

982
00:46:22.06 --> 00:46:27.90
me two days and I'm right back to 240 I can be like kind of doughy and soft and out of

983
00:46:27.90 --> 00:46:32.26
shape and only 240 I can be ripped and like nobody fat 240 it's like that's just what

984
00:46:32.26 --> 00:46:40.26
I went and so I was running marathons at that at that weight and so I did the super frog

985
00:46:40.26 --> 00:46:46.22
and because you know it's the original like throwback to the teens like it'd be cool

986
00:46:46.22 --> 00:46:50.90
and so I and they have a cutoff time right like if you don't finish by certain time

987
00:46:50.90 --> 00:46:56.94
and it's basically a half triathlon right yeah yeah it's a half iron man so it's 1.2

988
00:46:56.94 --> 00:47:05.54
mile swim 56 mile bike ride and half marathon and so I do it and if you don't make the cutoff

989
00:47:05.54 --> 00:47:11.02
time then you're you're DNF right did not finish same as somebody who drops out I made

990
00:47:11.02 --> 00:47:15.82
it by like three minutes I think it was like seven and a half hours and there's dudes doing

991
00:47:15.82 --> 00:47:21.82
this thing this guy's doing it like two and a half hours right and so I finish and barely

992
00:47:21.82 --> 00:47:26.74
make it three years later I've been doing triathlons the whole time right I ride my

993
00:47:26.74 --> 00:47:32.22
bike to work or ride my bike back and forth to school the hospital or whatever you know

994
00:47:32.22 --> 00:47:37.18
running whenever I can I'd never really practice a swim because I actually just did side-strike

995
00:47:37.18 --> 00:47:42.58
because my side-strike was as fast as my crawl anyway so I just did that and you can do that

996
00:47:42.58 --> 00:47:47.14
forever obviously like after buds like you get so you get so efficient at that movement

997
00:47:47.14 --> 00:47:54.54
I could go 20 miles today probably and so I do it again three years later two minutes

998
00:47:54.54 --> 00:48:04.22
faster after all that training like this like when I was training it when I was training

999
00:48:04.22 --> 00:48:12.02
it Odin Neto school do you know yeah so it's training at his school and I was it was like

1000
00:48:12.02 --> 00:48:18.06
incorporating the jet training into my bike ride like to like their nose bike to the hospital

1001
00:48:18.06 --> 00:48:22.14
and then leaving the hospital and stopping by there and then going and so that it like

1002
00:48:22.14 --> 00:48:30.54
five or six miles to my commute and and I still gasped all the time and I was like what the

1003
00:48:30.54 --> 00:48:34.46
hell like because I didn't understand the physiology at the time I'm like how can I still be

1004
00:48:34.46 --> 00:48:38.10
gassing like all it like I'm doing all this endurance work and I'm still gassing on the

1005
00:48:38.10 --> 00:48:43.50
mat like I remember the first time he had us do like he put out like whatever the five

1006
00:48:43.50 --> 00:48:47.38
or six black belts and it's like you're gonna roll two minutes here and then and then the

1007
00:48:47.38 --> 00:48:52.46
last guy rolled with this him I mean he just like thought yeah fall over it thought me at

1008
00:48:52.46 --> 00:48:57.02
fall like I couldn't do like a dream for like a guy that owns a school that's a black belt

1009
00:48:57.02 --> 00:49:02.62
and Odie probably ways what do you think Odin Neto would 70 yeah maybe 170 yeah so he's

1010
00:49:02.62 --> 00:49:08.50
just like oh I get to beat up this seat yeah I always try to keep it on the download it

1011
00:49:08.50 --> 00:49:12.82
has a seal but it gets out eventually right and then the soon as you're just a jacked 240

1012
00:49:12.82 --> 00:49:19.66
pound dude yeah they won't be with a white belt on right yeah Jeff Glover Jeff Glover

1013
00:49:19.66 --> 00:49:27.34
and I've seen this now he the best the worst I call the best the worst but it's the easiest

1014
00:49:27.34 --> 00:49:33.22
for him to go against a guy that's big and strong like he he is if he sees a guy that's

1015
00:49:33.22 --> 00:49:36.38
big and strong he's like oh yeah I'm gonna have fun with them and I've watched him do

1016
00:49:36.38 --> 00:49:40.98
it watch like big jack guys come in and he just is all over him and you see like another

1017
00:49:40.98 --> 00:49:45.66
guy that's more his size or a guy that's you know long and lanky or whatever it's more

1018
00:49:45.66 --> 00:49:50.98
trouble for him but a big jack guy he's like I got this fool yeah he didn't he did like

1019
00:49:50.98 --> 00:49:56.34
some sort of exhibition here or something with him another guy like yeah he's bar I mean

1020
00:49:56.34 --> 00:50:00.62
all kinds of stuff he's like watching two snakes yeah I mean he's just like this I mean

1021
00:50:00.62 --> 00:50:06.30
this rolled forever like from yeah from position to position position attempt attempt attempt

1022
00:50:06.30 --> 00:50:13.74
just like I can't even follow that freaking nuts alright so you get done with buds did

1023
00:50:13.74 --> 00:50:20.90
you do get rolled at all no that's good and you're you're what you're 18 19 years old

1024
00:50:20.90 --> 00:50:27.74
so I technically yeah so I was I was 19 because I graduated and technically because we actually

1025
00:50:27.74 --> 00:50:32.62
had Christmas break before we graduated we should have graduated so we're really done

1026
00:50:32.62 --> 00:50:37.34
with buds and I think we had like a 13 mile time to run around left or something or it

1027
00:50:37.34 --> 00:50:41.30
wasn't timed right it wasn't was there was some time to it but it wasn't the same as

1028
00:50:41.30 --> 00:50:44.82
is like yeah four mile I think it was more like you better not you better pass it type

1029
00:50:44.82 --> 00:50:48.74
thing yeah but there's I think it was a time like three hours yeah I think there was a

1030
00:50:48.74 --> 00:50:52.74
time limit but it wasn't three hours for it was it wasn't like the same consistent yeah

1031
00:50:52.74 --> 00:50:57.82
like everything else was like whatever the that's that same time I think it was seven

1032
00:50:57.82 --> 00:51:01.78
and a half minute miles was like the cutoff on all that stuff and that I think was a little

1033
00:51:01.78 --> 00:51:06.90
longer but so that's all we had to do is come back and do that and then we were graduating

1034
00:51:06.90 --> 00:51:13.02
so so I graduated technically in January of 90 okay and then you had to go to the airport

1035
00:51:13.02 --> 00:51:18.94
in March I would have turned 20 okay so yeah it's not end of night yeah then we went to

1036
00:51:18.94 --> 00:51:22.86
we were the first class that they sent us a class oh really they hadn't done it in a

1037
00:51:22.86 --> 00:51:27.70
really long time man did we get in trouble oh yeah oh yeah we get and we were there the

1038
00:51:27.70 --> 00:51:35.54
first time anybody died in jump school really and the dude I mean he was like from here probably

1039
00:51:35.54 --> 00:51:42.38
to probably to the mats like that far away from me like I heard that he just wrapped

1040
00:51:42.38 --> 00:51:49.30
in what happened to him we're doing combat equipment and he I don't know if his exit

1041
00:51:49.30 --> 00:51:58.06
was bad or whatever but he ended up inverted with his leg cotton and and the risers and

1042
00:51:58.06 --> 00:52:03.82
and he cigarette rolled to some degree and he pulled his reserve but his ruck was on

1043
00:52:03.82 --> 00:52:09.98
top of it because it had flopped on it so he's 19 he's from Texas and he just I mean

1044
00:52:09.98 --> 00:52:13.98
I heard that dude hit and then something like just like after you shoot a deer or something

1045
00:52:13.98 --> 00:52:22.58
you hear the right that I remember that so clearly and then anyway we you know we'd go

1046
00:52:22.58 --> 00:52:27.66
in the chow hall there and you know how the the army kids are taking that school seriously

1047
00:52:27.66 --> 00:52:33.70
and we're we're cocky as shit like on you can't whatever this is a joke for us and so

1048
00:52:33.70 --> 00:52:38.74
we'd sit around and smoke and joke in the in the chow for like an hour and like you know

1049
00:52:38.74 --> 00:52:43.78
keep going back and whatever and so this Stars and Stripe reporter comes around he starts

1050
00:52:43.78 --> 00:52:48.18
trying to ask everybody questions army kids are you know eating like a robot and then

1051
00:52:48.18 --> 00:52:56.22
bolt out the door right and and so we're like hey I won't tell you what happened so we told

1052
00:52:56.22 --> 00:53:02.58
him that we told him that that the guy didn't hook up because he was going to DOR at the

1053
00:53:02.58 --> 00:53:08.66
door and the instructor pushed him out and of course we had no idea what went on and

1054
00:53:08.66 --> 00:53:13.58
they printed it and they said oh my as told by any Navy personnel and so like then our

1055
00:53:13.58 --> 00:53:18.18
whole class gets called up in front of the head of the school like if you don't tell

1056
00:53:18.18 --> 00:53:23.62
me who did this throwing all of you out of course no one's gonna say anything right

1057
00:53:23.62 --> 00:53:27.06
I remember like all right throw us all out that's better than yeah getting rid of one

1058
00:53:27.06 --> 00:53:31.82
of our guys right better than being a rat right and so nobody said anything the school shut

1059
00:53:31.82 --> 00:53:35.46
down for like two weeks and we just got like hammered on like all the time like all day

1060
00:53:35.46 --> 00:53:39.50
every day they're trying to break out and now the dude ended up printing or traction

1061
00:53:39.50 --> 00:53:43.98
effort but yeah the first time anybody died so there's a couple weeks there had to have

1062
00:53:43.98 --> 00:53:47.26
been other people that died at airborne school they told us is the first time anybody's ever

1063
00:53:47.26 --> 00:53:54.50
burned in that seems impossible it does they put out thousands and thousands of paratroopers

1064
00:53:54.50 --> 00:53:59.30
every week now maybe it's the first guy that died in a while or something like that maybe

1065
00:53:59.30 --> 00:54:02.46
but they did they shut us down they shut the school down we're gonna get fact checked on

1066
00:54:02.46 --> 00:54:08.98
that one yeah we they shut the school down and we did I mean just like nothing for like

1067
00:54:08.98 --> 00:54:13.42
two weeks and then when we finally jocked up to go again they were still super edgy

1068
00:54:13.42 --> 00:54:18.54
oh yeah and we set like we set jocked up and combat equipment for like six hours waiting

1069
00:54:18.54 --> 00:54:25.10
100% to get in to get in the plane and jump out for five seconds yeah it was it was it

1070
00:54:25.10 --> 00:54:30.98
wasn't a cool fun a cool time so you end up checking in it you go to team five yeah and

1071
00:54:30.98 --> 00:54:37.98
this is what 1990 now 1990 yeah STT what we called it then yeah and so that's QT and that's

1072
00:54:37.98 --> 00:54:43.10
at the team yeah every team did their own yeah yeah that's what I went through yeah you

1073
00:54:43.10 --> 00:54:52.66
would have known um you were what 177 177 what class 3 or what 163 164 164 yeah yeah new

1074
00:54:52.66 --> 00:55:01.18
guy always so you get your first platoon any any any big deal from STT pretty straightforward

1075
00:55:01.18 --> 00:55:05.94
no we did we did they just hand you out an M60 and so here you go yeah you're a jacket

1076
00:55:05.94 --> 00:55:12.94
was what you do with me yeah because I got I I I hate you know I hated that M60 and I

1077
00:55:12.94 --> 00:55:17.66
don't want to carry a little poodle weapon pink and ding ding I like the spring sound

1078
00:55:17.66 --> 00:55:23.14
like you know cap gun I want a real gun man I loved the 60 and a super mechanical right

1079
00:55:23.14 --> 00:55:27.34
like I grew up like working on everything and like super mechanical so I was really good

1080
00:55:27.34 --> 00:55:31.98
at clearing the jams and knowing how to you know work the weapon really well and I really

1081
00:55:31.98 --> 00:55:37.82
enjoyed it hell yeah oh yeah then you so that's what you get your first platoon yeah and first

1082
00:55:37.82 --> 00:55:44.70
lieutenant rep 60 first lieutenant rep get some yeah and actually halfway through my

1083
00:55:44.70 --> 00:55:51.78
first platoon I became the department lead as a new guy right on and then and then I was

1084
00:55:51.78 --> 00:55:58.34
like always first lieutenant for my other two platoon just motorhead your motorhead yeah

1085
00:55:58.34 --> 00:56:05.94
so you're getting in there so we and you're going on deployment I mean what's work up

1086
00:56:05.94 --> 00:56:10.14
like what are you guys focused on what's the big mission I know I'm when I was you know

1087
00:56:10.14 --> 00:56:14.66
for my early platoons it was always like we were preparing for like one big mission that

1088
00:56:14.66 --> 00:56:19.98
we would pray would happen like we wouldn't we as much as I prayed for war which I did

1089
00:56:19.98 --> 00:56:27.66
yeah I couldn't have dreamed of like a two decade long war like I thought if we're lucky

1090
00:56:27.66 --> 00:56:33.90
we'll get some kind of a one mission you know there'll be something will happen and if we're

1091
00:56:33.90 --> 00:56:37.10
in the right spot at the right time maybe we'll get to do one thing yeah that's how

1092
00:56:37.10 --> 00:56:41.30
scarce it was yeah people don't know that you're like competing like used car salesman

1093
00:56:41.30 --> 00:56:46.38
for any work that comes out for your special forces are it's like you have to have somebody

1094
00:56:46.38 --> 00:56:52.10
jockey and to try to get the work was Gardner in your first platoon no he was in he's in

1095
00:56:52.10 --> 00:57:03.66
my sister you guys get like rolled up or something yeah yeah my my 21st birthday to walk I can't

1096
00:57:03.66 --> 00:57:06.98
remember I can't remember any of the names of the bars but we walk into this one bar

1097
00:57:06.98 --> 00:57:15.98
it's really common one and Jason was standing up on the bar when I when I walked in choked

1098
00:57:15.98 --> 00:57:23.66
a beer and then like slammed the bottle around why because I can't I'm like I'm gonna like

1099
00:57:23.66 --> 00:57:29.90
this guy so that wasn't my birthday I take it back that's like when we first that was

1100
00:57:29.90 --> 00:57:34.02
just like a Tuesday night that was like the first that's like the first time I think I'd

1101
00:57:34.02 --> 00:57:38.46
been out in town really you know it wasn't a big deal because I'd already obviously you

1102
00:57:38.46 --> 00:57:44.34
could go drink at any age but my 21st birthday is like oh so the whole platoon well first

1103
00:57:44.34 --> 00:57:50.62
of course yeah they were rigorous tape me and throw me in shit river so and it was so

1104
00:57:50.62 --> 00:57:56.18
I was so stupid because we had like a trailer right divided in half and P.I. did you guys

1105
00:57:56.18 --> 00:58:00.50
have the same thing I didn't avoid the P.I. missed it oh yeah right because of the mountain

1106
00:58:00.50 --> 00:58:04.94
too but yeah so we had the just like a regular trailer and it was like partitioned and there

1107
00:58:04.94 --> 00:58:12.66
was a platoon space on each side and they had like a regular half padlock on on the outside

1108
00:58:12.66 --> 00:58:20.30
and so we were walking up we were walking up to our trailer and our sister platoon

1109
00:58:20.30 --> 00:58:26.38
was in there was in their side and my LPO goes up and you know like puts their has been

1110
00:58:26.38 --> 00:58:29.66
like while they're while they're in these lock and so I think I like locking them in

1111
00:58:29.66 --> 00:58:35.18
right and then we have our platoon meeting and then he goes and then at the end of the

1112
00:58:35.18 --> 00:58:44.14
meeting he looks around he says hey whatever you guys do I don't want you to rigorous tape

1113
00:58:44.14 --> 00:58:50.54
buck up and throw me shit river and I look around and every single guy's holding a roll

1114
00:58:50.54 --> 00:58:56.66
of rigorous tape and I totally missed this the whole time I'm like oh you gotta be kidding

1115
00:58:56.66 --> 00:59:05.10
me man now I realize oh that side's locked that's what that was about and it was just

1116
00:59:05.10 --> 00:59:12.42
a shit fight man I mean just like 45 minutes and finally got just grabbed my balls and

1117
00:59:12.42 --> 00:59:17.50
just started squeezing my balls every year like that's the fight ender okay alright everyone

1118
00:59:17.50 --> 00:59:22.86
is a tough guy tape me up guys grabs your nuts and start squeezing them yeah and anyways

1119
00:59:22.86 --> 00:59:29.34
and yes so when we go we go out in the town and I don't even remember how it started like

1120
00:59:29.34 --> 00:59:36.42
I don't even hardly remember the fight at all but I like knocked some short patrol guy out

1121
00:59:36.42 --> 00:59:42.18
and just went to the bar because I was drunk more on and like I'll be fine like he's unconscious

1122
00:59:42.18 --> 00:59:47.54
would you so I go in the bar and then when we come out of the bar they're like there

1123
00:59:47.54 --> 00:59:51.42
he is and like all these people start swarming up and try to run and then like a hit some

1124
00:59:51.42 --> 00:59:57.70
other guy while I was trying to run away and they finally got us and then or got me and

1125
00:59:57.70 --> 01:00:05.18
then a handcuff me in front and I'm like you know even a drunk guy's like that's a dumb

1126
01:00:05.18 --> 01:00:11.74
idea and so I so I start walking to the patty wagon it's like a Toyota truck with like the

1127
01:00:11.74 --> 01:00:21.42
built on kind of camper or whatever like a patty wagon thing and and the dude that I'd

1128
01:00:21.42 --> 01:00:24.66
the tour patrol guy that I'd hit was like standing there holding the door smirking and

1129
01:00:24.66 --> 01:00:28.14
said like said something smart and I fucking hit him again with both hands in front of

1130
01:00:28.14 --> 01:00:32.90
him like he he went out cold and hit his head on the bumper and I was like well that's

1131
01:00:32.90 --> 01:00:38.22
really good so then they don't recognize how stupid we can be yeah yeah they just don't

1132
01:00:38.22 --> 01:00:43.50
know yeah so then they throw me in the patty wagon and I'm drunk I just like through the

1133
01:00:43.50 --> 01:00:49.02
wagon spin and I'm so drunk and so I lay down on my back and put my feet in the corners

1134
01:00:49.02 --> 01:00:52.50
and then when we get to the jail so wouldn't when I get in there Jason's in there with

1135
01:00:52.50 --> 01:00:56.94
me and he's like hey man I'm like hey and they like he I don't know what he was in

1136
01:00:56.94 --> 01:01:01.34
there for I don't even remember and then they get us to the police station and they pull

1137
01:01:01.34 --> 01:01:05.34
everybody out and I'm like I'm not getting out and they they're trying to pull me out

1138
01:01:05.34 --> 01:01:10.70
they can't get me out and so they lock the door and they go in and they come back and

1139
01:01:10.70 --> 01:01:16.30
try to get me out again I won't get out and then they bring out this big their big tough

1140
01:01:16.30 --> 01:01:19.70
guy short patrol guy whatever and he's gonna get me out and so they put him in and lock

1141
01:01:19.70 --> 01:01:26.06
the door and and I I managed to like put some pressure on a stroller and like pull him

1142
01:01:26.06 --> 01:01:32.46
in to me and he and it was like essentially breaking his wrist backwards right because

1143
01:01:32.46 --> 01:01:35.42
he and he couldn't get off of it because like the way his body position like he was

1144
01:01:35.42 --> 01:01:38.98
just half his body weight was on his wrist and it was inverted and I'm just pulling

1145
01:01:38.98 --> 01:01:44.30
on him and he's screaming they let him out and then I'm still laying there and then all

1146
01:01:44.30 --> 01:01:50.54
of a sudden I hear this maybe 45 minutes go by and I hear my officer go hey buck I was

1147
01:01:50.54 --> 01:01:56.74
like yeah let's go my god and I get out they unhand cuff me and and I went back to barracks

1148
01:01:56.74 --> 01:02:00.98
with him and then you know your your senior chief whatever goes and smooths things over

1149
01:02:00.98 --> 01:02:06.42
the next day gives a guy a case of beer or whatever like this is stupidest time you know

1150
01:02:06.42 --> 01:02:12.78
like we like all of our excitement was self-induced and and I was in for the first goal for right

1151
01:02:12.78 --> 01:02:19.26
like it the so the first golf or shut my work up down was that your first work my first

1152
01:02:19.26 --> 01:02:26.78
work up yeah and and we were we were so we got the cool thing was because of that whatever

1153
01:02:26.78 --> 01:02:30.86
the they thought the mission set was they we became a freefall platoon so the first thing

1154
01:02:30.86 --> 01:02:36.50
I did was go to freefall school I think I only had like two or three more jumps whatever

1155
01:02:36.50 --> 01:02:41.34
you get in STT was like the only other jumps I had other than jump school so I never did

1156
01:02:41.34 --> 01:02:45.98
static line again right I just and unless it's in the water right for duck or something

1157
01:02:45.98 --> 01:02:54.66
um yeah so we we uh we got our our work up gut I think work ups are like a year and a

1158
01:02:54.66 --> 01:03:00.02
half then right yeah and they get we get shut down to buddy here got compressed and then

1159
01:03:00.02 --> 01:03:06.06
we didn't end up going to go for anyways because I think maybe it was like half over like you

1160
01:03:06.06 --> 01:03:10.70
know how limited that whole thing was and so then we deployed to the PI and then a mountain

1161
01:03:10.70 --> 01:03:16.22
penitubo blue when we're out there and that that was a very interesting what you guys

1162
01:03:16.22 --> 01:03:24.46
do on that just like provide as much security yeah yeah so we so we were so a lot of people

1163
01:03:24.46 --> 01:03:30.86
know this but like when that mount when mountain penitubo blue probably because it blew there

1164
01:03:30.86 --> 01:03:37.22
was a typhoon at the same time and so you know Clark airbase the Air Force base which

1165
01:03:37.22 --> 01:03:43.90
was 45 minute drive or something way they had boulders the size of this room coming

1166
01:03:43.90 --> 01:03:49.22
down from miles high in the sky just like landing on buildings and cars and whatever

1167
01:03:49.22 --> 01:03:54.98
and uh that place was demolished and but we just got all this ash we got some rocks but

1168
01:03:54.98 --> 01:03:59.66
like we get all this ash and the ash had a ton of metal ore in it and it was mixed in

1169
01:03:59.66 --> 01:04:05.62
with the typhoon so you have like 70 80 mile an hour winds with rain and then this ash

1170
01:04:05.62 --> 01:04:10.30
with all this metal in it and it was and it was sticking it sticks to everything and it

1171
01:04:10.30 --> 01:04:14.98
looks like kind of grayish snow but it's super heavy and it collapses there it's like all

1172
01:04:14.98 --> 01:04:20.70
the buildings are collapsing like our our our pbs and our and our peers are floating peers

1173
01:04:20.70 --> 01:04:25.98
were sinking and all our buildings are collapsing so they're like there's like the first night

1174
01:04:25.98 --> 01:04:30.70
of this thing and they're like hey we all need to go down to the unit and like save all

1175
01:04:30.70 --> 01:04:35.82
the so we go and we you know we we we don't even have shovels we have bode ores right

1176
01:04:35.82 --> 01:04:40.46
and uh and we're just and like a boat ore of this stuff probably weighed 30 pounds

1177
01:04:40.46 --> 01:04:45.66
like it was just super compact and so we go and shovel all that off and then we're going

1178
01:04:45.66 --> 01:04:51.74
up on the roofs and we're trying to save you know the buildings we got up on the periloft

1179
01:04:51.74 --> 01:04:55.86
and uh there's no light right you can't see anything we're wearing flight suits with

1180
01:04:55.86 --> 01:05:00.38
scuba mask and you could shine a flashlight and you could about see your feet pre head

1181
01:05:00.38 --> 01:05:05.58
lamp right it's so crazy no one had thought of head lamps yeah and so I get up to the

1182
01:05:05.58 --> 01:05:09.14
top of the periloft and these guys are going hey over here over here over here and sound

1183
01:05:09.14 --> 01:05:15.22
like I'm walking their way and all of a sudden I stop and I'm like I feel like I'm I feel

1184
01:05:15.22 --> 01:05:19.30
like I'm going the wrong I'm trying to remember what the building was like I was like I feel

1185
01:05:19.30 --> 01:05:23.58
like I'm going the wrong way and I pull out a flashlight and I look at my feet and one

1186
01:05:23.58 --> 01:05:27.78
of my feet it's like one of my toes are hanging over the edge like one more step I was gonna

1187
01:05:27.78 --> 01:05:32.66
fall 60 feet and so anyway we're shoving all this off and then we go into like one of

1188
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:38.86
the big barn kind of things and we're shelling off and like buildings are collapsing while

1189
01:05:38.86 --> 01:05:44.14
we're on them and we're like jumping off whatever and so then we all kind of show up in this

1190
01:05:44.14 --> 01:05:51.46
and this barn has like the big I beams supporting the roof right and we're in there and somebody's

1191
01:05:51.46 --> 01:05:54.86
like I think maybe we should get out of here what if this one collapses and I look up and

1192
01:05:54.86 --> 01:06:00.70
I'm like there's no way this is gonna and we're like we all dive out like the doors

1193
01:06:00.70 --> 01:06:05.26
you know it's like this wide the doors open this wide like 20 guys get through that thing

1194
01:06:05.26 --> 01:06:09.54
in like five seconds you know and the whole thing collapses and so so there was no power

1195
01:06:09.54 --> 01:06:15.22
for like six weeks there's no water there is no anything and there were bodies laying

1196
01:06:15.22 --> 01:06:19.02
in the ditches all over the place of course in town they have like generators going and

1197
01:06:19.02 --> 01:06:24.06
everything's going like two days later they're like up and running nothing ever happened

1198
01:06:24.06 --> 01:06:31.26
and then we had like the they call them the NPA like the the Vietnam Equivalent or the

1199
01:06:31.26 --> 01:06:38.74
Philippine equivalent of the Vietnamese Communist I guess and they start trying to infiltrate

1200
01:06:38.74 --> 01:06:45.26
the base and like get equipment and all this stuff and we were closing the base because

1201
01:06:45.26 --> 01:06:49.18
there was so much damage and the negotiations had failed I think we offered them like ten

1202
01:06:49.18 --> 01:06:52.14
million dollars and they went like a hundred million dollars and I'm sorry we're out of

1203
01:06:52.14 --> 01:06:55.98
here so we're gonna close the base anyway and so they started trying to come on the

1204
01:06:55.98 --> 01:07:00.82
base and so we were like patrolling against them and like you know arresting some of those

1205
01:07:00.82 --> 01:07:05.54
guys and stuff and I was like they're kind of like the closest thing to combat that we

1206
01:07:05.54 --> 01:07:12.90
saw you know and we had like drug interdiction with the FBI and stuff and I was like the

1207
01:07:12.90 --> 01:07:17.78
most exciting thing I did which is kind of one of the reasons I got out is like you know

1208
01:07:17.78 --> 01:07:20.94
it's just like the same training trips over and over again doing the same stuff over and

1209
01:07:20.94 --> 01:07:24.38
over again it's like I don't think we're ever gonna go to war again like I'm gonna

1210
01:07:24.38 --> 01:07:28.66
go do something else you know and then of course while I'm in medical school 9-11 happens

1211
01:07:28.66 --> 01:07:32.34
so you did you did a couple more platoons of team five and like you said like you're

1212
01:07:32.34 --> 01:07:36.58
it's the 90s and you're just going through work up it's always fun I mean yeah it's

1213
01:07:36.58 --> 01:07:41.30
super fun yeah Hollywood seals what we call it you know it's like it was like it was super

1214
01:07:41.30 --> 01:07:46.02
fun yeah and you're well for me I was always like thought the big mission was coming and

1215
01:07:46.02 --> 01:07:51.22
so I was always just like hey you gotta be ready in my mind I was trying to be ready

1216
01:07:51.22 --> 01:07:54.78
I wish I had your confidence about that I was like we had Bill Clinton in the White House

1217
01:07:54.78 --> 01:08:00.66
I'm like we're never going to war kidding me so you do a couple more platoons and then

1218
01:08:00.66 --> 01:08:05.18
you're like all right did you when you when you decided to get out did you know you wanted

1219
01:08:05.18 --> 01:08:12.90
to become a doctor no so what was your plan when you got out well so I started dating

1220
01:08:12.90 --> 01:08:21.82
this girl who became my first wife like after after my first platoon I dated her during

1221
01:08:21.82 --> 01:08:25.86
my second work up and then I deployed and then I came back and I was supposed to do

1222
01:08:25.86 --> 01:08:30.30
like nine months of shore duty you know like work in the department start school kind of

1223
01:08:30.30 --> 01:08:36.18
transition out and then I got thrown in a platoon because somebody got hurt and so kind of deployed

1224
01:08:36.18 --> 01:08:39.90
actually until supposed to be until the day I got out but it ended up being like four or

1225
01:08:39.90 --> 01:08:48.30
five days after I got I was actually technically out and I came back anyway so I she was in

1226
01:08:48.30 --> 01:08:52.30
physical therapy school so wait so you're dating each other you got married we're dating

1227
01:08:52.30 --> 01:08:56.78
okay you're dating and she's figure out this way you're you date this you start dating

1228
01:08:56.78 --> 01:08:59.78
this girl you figure you're gonna get gonna get out but you end up getting thrown into

1229
01:08:59.78 --> 01:09:04.54
a platoon you do the deployment you come home you have no plan and you're out of the Navy

1230
01:09:04.54 --> 01:09:10.06
boom right okay and she's going to physical therapy school yes so she by the time I came back

1231
01:09:10.06 --> 01:09:14.70
for my second deployment she is like three months out of grad school and she was working

1232
01:09:14.70 --> 01:09:20.46
at San Diego Children's Hospital and and I used to take her textbooks on deployment

1233
01:09:20.46 --> 01:09:26.02
and read them because I like I was just interested in you know physiology and anatomy and like

1234
01:09:26.02 --> 01:09:31.98
I anything to make me bigger and stronger and faster and whatever better and so I felt

1235
01:09:31.98 --> 01:09:35.58
like I didn't interest in that but I didn't you know I'd never done well in school I was

1236
01:09:35.58 --> 01:09:39.78
convinced that I was dumb really until I until I got in the name of like an A school I did

1237
01:09:39.78 --> 01:09:43.78
really well like I top of my class and then like I'd really well academically and buds

1238
01:09:43.78 --> 01:09:48.42
and so I thought well maybe I'm not stupid maybe I just like never really applied myself

1239
01:09:48.42 --> 01:09:53.10
but we'll see right so you go like you know I have a GED so I can't get into any college

1240
01:09:53.10 --> 01:09:59.42
I have to go to at least a year of junior college probably two and so I went there and

1241
01:09:59.42 --> 01:10:04.74
like started setting the curve in every class that I thought maybe is gonna be like jadjee

1242
01:10:04.74 --> 01:10:09.38
or something like an athletic trainer maybe a physical therapist if like things are really

1243
01:10:09.38 --> 01:10:14.38
worked out great for me and to to apply to physical therapy school you have to like have

1244
01:10:14.38 --> 01:10:20.38
2000 volunteer hours right well that's that's a year full-time work right so part-time work

1245
01:10:20.38 --> 01:10:23.94
that gets a couple of years and so I'm like well I get I'll start getting my volunteer

1246
01:10:23.94 --> 01:10:29.18
hours and they hired me after I'd volunteered there for maybe a week and they're like we

1247
01:10:29.18 --> 01:10:34.50
don't you can work for us and so then I worked as a physical therapy assistant at San Diego

1248
01:10:34.50 --> 01:10:41.78
Sports Medicine Center the whole Thomas in college and that was like a healthcare mecca

1249
01:10:41.78 --> 01:10:46.22
they had everything you know they had orthopedic surgeons they had sports medicine guys they

1250
01:10:46.22 --> 01:10:52.78
had DOs they had MDs they had podiatrists they had massage therapists PT's athletic

1251
01:10:52.78 --> 01:11:01.34
trainers so we had everything and I I got to know all of the people and got to see everybody's

1252
01:11:01.34 --> 01:11:07.78
work and I'm standing in the hallway with a couple of doctors because they're about

1253
01:11:07.78 --> 01:11:13.98
my age right because I because I'd you know been in the teams first so they're maybe two

1254
01:11:13.98 --> 01:11:18.42
or three years older than me and I got to be friends with them and we're standing out

1255
01:11:18.42 --> 01:11:26.98
on the hallway one day and and they're telling me you should go to medical school pump the

1256
01:11:26.98 --> 01:11:32.38
brace there sparky like I didn't like I'm like I'm even close to medical school and

1257
01:11:32.38 --> 01:11:36.30
so they're trying to convince me that I can get in a medical school and I'm like no frickin

1258
01:11:36.30 --> 01:11:41.46
way I can get I'm getting in a medical school and then the the doctor that owned it Lee

1259
01:11:41.46 --> 01:11:47.26
Ryce he's out here still and he said he steps out of the office and he goes Kirk I didn't

1260
01:11:47.26 --> 01:11:52.42
even know he knew my name right it's a Kirk the question isn't whether you can get in

1261
01:11:52.42 --> 01:11:57.58
question is would you go if you got in and I said of course he goes well then you kind

1262
01:11:57.58 --> 01:12:03.66
of have to try don't you I was like shit trapped you yeah I was like right and then I ended

1263
01:12:03.66 --> 01:12:06.62
up going to work for him when I got to the Navy like my first year in the Navy I went

1264
01:12:06.62 --> 01:12:13.94
back to his practice he had a concierge practice in Point Loma out here and yeah but that that's

1265
01:12:13.94 --> 01:12:19.06
how that came about man and I I mean I was fully planning to be an orthopedic surgeon

1266
01:12:19.06 --> 01:12:24.54
because I'm like a mechanical dude and I like I like this succinctly broken not broken yeah

1267
01:12:24.54 --> 01:12:29.14
hey this is broken and put some bolts and screws and then plates and it's not gonna be

1268
01:12:29.14 --> 01:12:33.34
broken anymore and that's it and then I'm gonna go on and do it again I don't want to look

1269
01:12:33.34 --> 01:12:38.26
at anybody's frickin anion gap or like care about what medications are online I doesn't

1270
01:12:38.26 --> 01:12:47.42
interest me I want to go fix things and and then in and the Navy you have to do an operational

1271
01:12:47.42 --> 01:12:52.06
tour before they let you finish residency so you do like your first year and then they

1272
01:12:52.06 --> 01:12:56.62
you have to go to the fleet if you don't if you don't so wait sir do you already gotten

1273
01:12:56.62 --> 01:12:59.82
commissioned or were you planning to go back in the Navy what was the whole story about

1274
01:12:59.82 --> 01:13:04.58
yeah I totally skipped that part yeah so when so when I decided to apply for medical school

1275
01:13:04.58 --> 01:13:09.18
pre-internet so I went to the bookstore and started looking through the Kaplan books to

1276
01:13:09.18 --> 01:13:13.38
see like what schools would I be competitive for with my with my GPA and my MCAT and all

1277
01:13:13.38 --> 01:13:18.90
that and that's when I found out that the Navy had his own school I was like no way

1278
01:13:18.90 --> 01:13:24.58
are you kidding me and so I look into it's like they'll pay me to go to medical school

1279
01:13:24.58 --> 01:13:28.42
instead of the other way around and of course I'm married and have a kid and have a kid

1280
01:13:28.42 --> 01:13:34.22
on the way like well that makes a lot more sense right like I wasn't excited to go on

1281
01:13:34.22 --> 01:13:38.86
the Navy trust me like I you know I was in the team that's a good fit for the team but

1282
01:13:38.86 --> 01:13:44.82
I wasn't a good fit for the Navy I knew that and I was like all right well I'll do this

1283
01:13:44.82 --> 01:13:49.14
right now and I knew that there was you know this eight year commitment afterwards and

1284
01:13:49.14 --> 01:13:52.58
I was like well I'll go back to the teams for a while and I'll like give back to the

1285
01:13:52.58 --> 01:13:57.30
community who saved me from prison or you know whatever I was gonna end up if I if I

1286
01:13:57.30 --> 01:14:08.10
didn't have you know something to channel my anger with right and so I I did you know

1287
01:14:08.10 --> 01:14:15.58
when you do your operational to she got commissioned in 2000 go to OIS Connecticut basically the

1288
01:14:15.58 --> 01:14:21.06
knife and fork school knife and fork school they gave me some kind of award there I'm

1289
01:14:21.06 --> 01:14:27.18
so ridiculous I don't I think I did like I participated in like 25% of that school like

1290
01:14:27.18 --> 01:14:31.22
they couldn't make pants for me I have really big legs and kind of a normal waist and they

1291
01:14:31.22 --> 01:14:37.70
kept making they're like trying to make khaki pants like from scratch like these girls and

1292
01:14:37.70 --> 01:14:41.98
they were ridiculous I mean never and it was just like they kept trying all this stuff

1293
01:14:41.98 --> 01:14:45.66
so I never had a uniform and I'd be like well I gotta go to the I gotta go to the uniform

1294
01:14:45.66 --> 01:14:49.54
store again and that's all I did for like three weeks was like try to get a uniform

1295
01:14:49.54 --> 01:14:57.38
to fit and then and so and then they give me some sort of award is comical and then

1296
01:14:57.38 --> 01:15:06.30
go to medical school and then from there I did you know there was some hoopla I won't

1297
01:15:06.30 --> 01:15:14.50
get into but ended up coming back to San Diego to do internship which is the first year residency

1298
01:15:14.50 --> 01:15:19.50
essentially and then you have to go out to the fleet do that Balboa I did it Balboa yeah

1299
01:15:19.50 --> 01:15:27.06
and the you do that and if and then after that year if you just say hey I just want

1300
01:15:27.06 --> 01:15:30.14
to come back as soon as possible then they just send you out to some fleet job you're

1301
01:15:30.14 --> 01:15:37.34
probably going to go 30 seconds to be on the ship or something right but if you go to

1302
01:15:37.34 --> 01:15:41.54
flight school you can be a flight surgeon you go to dive school and and you know most

1303
01:15:41.54 --> 01:15:45.90
school in Connecticut and then you can obviously go back to like our units or dive unit or

1304
01:15:45.90 --> 01:15:53.46
something like that so I was like I'll do DMO and I'll go back to the teams for a while

1305
01:15:53.46 --> 01:16:01.94
then I'll come back and finish residency and I went to dive school and then at the

1306
01:16:01.94 --> 01:16:07.74
end of it there weren't there weren't any orders for the teams so they put me on at

1307
01:16:07.74 --> 01:16:14.46
the submarine rescue unit out here on the end of point limo okay no not it's I'm sorry

1308
01:16:14.46 --> 01:16:21.94
it's at the end of North Island now and that was like a policy job really because a lot

1309
01:16:21.94 --> 01:16:29.86
of people don't realize this but like every country that has submarines like they all

1310
01:16:29.86 --> 01:16:33.14
they all have this agreement that will will rescue each other submarines even our enemies

1311
01:16:33.14 --> 01:16:37.94
like China Russia doesn't matter like your submarine goes down on our waters and it's

1312
01:16:37.94 --> 01:16:43.38
saveable we'll use our system to save your guys because technically these systems can

1313
01:16:43.38 --> 01:16:48.82
go anywhere in the world but with a realistic time when there's probably not in realistic

1314
01:16:48.82 --> 01:16:53.62
to like fly it over there and set everything up so you're gonna be much better off of the

1315
01:16:53.62 --> 01:16:57.70
country that you're closest to saves them and so then you have to make all these agreements

1316
01:16:57.70 --> 01:17:01.74
like well who whose patients are they gonna be whose dive tables are we're gonna use we

1317
01:17:01.74 --> 01:17:05.82
have to recompress them like what like what's gonna be our product and so that's all we

1318
01:17:05.82 --> 01:17:12.10
did is travel around the world and meet endless meetings and come up with new policy and then

1319
01:17:12.10 --> 01:17:20.46
then I had the opportunity to either go back to the hospital or go to the teams I was like

1320
01:17:20.46 --> 01:17:25.26
I really feel like I should do that and so then I go back to the teams and that's right

1321
01:17:25.26 --> 01:17:29.66
when they called it I think they were calling it they're still calling it the human performance

1322
01:17:29.66 --> 01:17:34.30
program and then switch the tactical asset program and so I got there right when they

1323
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:39.82
were funding the build out of that clinic nice of course I was a perfect fit for that

1324
01:17:39.82 --> 01:17:44.30
some freaking PT clinics like duh like I did this for I did this all through college

1325
01:17:44.30 --> 01:17:47.82
like I know what I'm doing so and then like and there's a great time like I got to be

1326
01:17:47.82 --> 01:17:52.26
there when we hired everybody like when we hired the first you know the first athletic

1327
01:17:52.26 --> 01:17:55.82
trainer the first PT the first nutritionist the first strength and conditioning coach

1328
01:17:55.82 --> 01:17:59.26
like which is crazy to think about everything that you're just saying is the first the first

1329
01:17:59.26 --> 01:18:03.78
the first the first yeah in 2009 have any of this stuff yeah like it was just like your

1330
01:18:03.78 --> 01:18:09.86
PT was whatever your CO or whatever your exo was into so your exo like to run and swim

1331
01:18:09.86 --> 01:18:14.46
guess what you were doing for PT like run swim swim run run if you got injured it was

1332
01:18:14.46 --> 01:18:19.54
like yeah like you dealt with it like figured out whatever your corpsmen could do for you

1333
01:18:19.54 --> 01:18:24.42
because you weren't going to drive across the bridge and go to rehab at Pete freaking

1334
01:18:24.42 --> 01:18:30.14
Balboa yeah and even if you do that what are they rehabbing a sailor at Balboa for rehabbing

1335
01:18:30.14 --> 01:18:35.58
him to like get out of the Navy right the medical retirement right that's what they're

1336
01:18:35.58 --> 01:18:39.78
rehabbing him for in the teams that guys want to go back to work right like I'm hurt you

1337
01:18:39.78 --> 01:18:43.62
make me better now right yeah I've got to go to Nile in two weeks make me better right

1338
01:18:43.62 --> 01:18:47.22
now right and that's the other thing you're traveling so much like how much rehab do you

1339
01:18:47.22 --> 01:18:50.74
really have unless you're going to get pulled out of your platoon but you might as well

1340
01:18:50.74 --> 01:18:54.54
die before you do that like just let your arm fall off like maybe you'll still be able

1341
01:18:54.54 --> 01:18:59.34
to make it yeah that that happened with stump so stump came over and saw me when he's getting

1342
01:18:59.34 --> 01:19:07.54
out uh-huh and he's like I didn't know him I knew who I knew who he was and and he he

1343
01:19:07.54 --> 01:19:11.54
comes over and he's like hey you know I'm getting out like two days and everybody keeps

1344
01:19:11.54 --> 01:19:16.22
telling me you should look at my record so here it is so he gives me some records like

1345
01:19:16.22 --> 01:19:22.58
paper thin and I open it and his and his discharge physical was like good to go everything's

1346
01:19:22.58 --> 01:19:28.98
good I'm sitting there I'm like didn't you get shot he's like yeah like you know now

1347
01:19:28.98 --> 01:19:36.26
that's in here he's like does that matter I'm like yeah that matters like I said regards

1348
01:19:36.26 --> 01:19:41.98
of how you feel now if you start having some serious problems and you need surgery revision

1349
01:19:41.98 --> 01:19:49.50
like big care like that's you know what what if you know what what if and so he's he's

1350
01:19:49.50 --> 01:19:54.26
like oh okay and so then I check into it I'm like you're gonna have to stand and not he

1351
01:19:54.26 --> 01:20:00.54
was pissed man oh sure he ended up ended up I did I just saw him recently and I was like

1352
01:20:00.54 --> 01:20:03.54
she's still pissed with me about that he's like no best thing ever how much longer how

1353
01:20:03.54 --> 01:20:07.54
much longer do you think he ended up in like in another year damn because he had to go

1354
01:20:07.54 --> 01:20:12.50
through a med board oh for sure yeah but I mean there was nothing in there he's nothing

1355
01:20:12.50 --> 01:20:17.22
in there it was literally just like signed off like good good good good like I said medical

1356
01:20:17.22 --> 01:20:20.50
record like I said what I was what's your answer to the question it's like find you up how

1357
01:20:20.50 --> 01:20:24.78
your shoulder's fine knee fine neck fine yep got surgery yep it's fine now yeah everything

1358
01:20:24.78 --> 01:20:28.94
is just fine fine fine can I get out of here now yeah I want to leave yeah like like you're

1359
01:20:28.94 --> 01:20:33.82
saying at the beginning no nobody wants to see the doctor but more to the point nobody

1360
01:20:33.82 --> 01:20:37.26
trusts the doctor right because that's the guy who can put you on the bench what's the

1361
01:20:37.26 --> 01:20:41.22
worst thing you do to a team guy pulling out of his balloon I give you something that's

1362
01:20:41.22 --> 01:20:46.10
disqualifying I say oh you have a problem you need meds you're disqualified you can't

1363
01:20:46.10 --> 01:20:54.70
take any real medification in the teams and you know that that I mean interestingly because

1364
01:20:54.70 --> 01:20:59.18
of that nuance that's that's why I ended up learning everything that I learned as a SEAL

1365
01:20:59.18 --> 01:21:05.26
teams and doing what I do now I mean less than 1% of what I do now has anything to do

1366
01:21:05.26 --> 01:21:10.66
with what I learned in medical school or residency or anything like it's all outside

1367
01:21:10.66 --> 01:21:17.22
I was talking to a guy that was oh it was Jason I think it was Jason but you know he

1368
01:21:17.22 --> 01:21:21.18
had come from where the baseball or football where did he come from?

1369
01:21:21.18 --> 01:21:27.50
Oh yeah yeah yeah Jethro was baseball yeah and maybe it wasn't him I was talking to somebody

1370
01:21:27.50 --> 01:21:36.38
that was football and he said something like he worked at Bud's Medical and at Bud's Medical

1371
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:44.46
he said he would see like whatever the number was 40 cases of patella femoral syndrome a

1372
01:21:44.46 --> 01:21:50.06
week yeah and he said when he was with the NFL he saw like two cases right and it was

1373
01:21:50.06 --> 01:21:55.82
like that for every injury like shin splints if you're at Bud's Medical you see 50 cases

1374
01:21:55.82 --> 01:22:00.62
a week of shin splints and you just go down the list of shoulder injury and so the teams

1375
01:22:00.62 --> 01:22:05.46
the same way like oh shoulder injury knee injury like you're just gonna see so many of it you

1376
01:22:05.46 --> 01:22:11.18
get so good at it right that it's like an environment where you're just gonna learn

1377
01:22:11.18 --> 01:22:18.38
so much so so you were in this critical role as this thing kind of stood up where the the

1378
01:22:18.38 --> 01:22:25.66
teams started taking the health of the seal more like as serious as we could possibly

1379
01:22:25.66 --> 01:22:32.66
take yeah and do proactive stuff too right so what did you what does being in the teams

1380
01:22:32.66 --> 01:22:41.22
do to a dude well so this is how it all got started right we built that facility we hired

1381
01:22:41.22 --> 01:22:46.14
all these great people like you said pull people from pro teams from Olympic training

1382
01:22:46.14 --> 01:22:52.46
center really top notch top tiers colleges and so we have all these brilliant people

1383
01:22:52.46 --> 01:22:57.78
who are great at their job now I'm the dumbest guy there right because like I'm just a guy

1384
01:22:57.78 --> 01:23:03.22
who looked worked in the sports medicine center in college and like I don't really know any

1385
01:23:03.22 --> 01:23:07.02
of this stuff so what does the Navy do when you're the dumbest guy put you in charge right

1386
01:23:07.02 --> 01:23:11.34
so like well now you're gonna supervise all these people and so like I now have the supervisory

1387
01:23:11.34 --> 01:23:17.26
position and in the rehab facility and so as you know like my office was in between those

1388
01:23:17.26 --> 01:23:23.26
two sides of it and so guys be over there doing rehab and you know I had been a seal

1389
01:23:23.26 --> 01:23:26.50
recently enough to where there's still a ton of guys in there that I went through training

1390
01:23:26.50 --> 01:23:32.50
with and that I deployed with and so I had a good enough reputation the guys trusted

1391
01:23:32.50 --> 01:23:36.38
me and they come and shut the door like hey I'm tell you what's really going on with me

1392
01:23:36.38 --> 01:23:41.38
right because like you said fine fine fine like fine fine fine everything should it's

1393
01:23:41.38 --> 01:23:45.58
like you know the put rigorous tape over a bullet hole that they had to just really I

1394
01:23:45.58 --> 01:23:50.74
don't want to get put on the bench trust this dude and so they came in I can't remember

1395
01:23:50.74 --> 01:23:54.62
who the first guy was at this point but comes in it's like you know what's really going

1396
01:23:54.62 --> 01:24:01.22
on with me and he's talking about we you know I can't remember anything right he comes in

1397
01:24:01.22 --> 01:24:06.38
a room gets twice air leaves remember come back forget up it leaves his house five six

1398
01:24:06.38 --> 01:24:10.82
times in the morning getting the scarf back up forgot my badge and going oh forget that's

1399
01:24:10.82 --> 01:24:17.30
for it and and then they'd be saying when you know my motivation just sucks my concentration

1400
01:24:17.30 --> 01:24:21.46
sucks like sitting me sitting meetings I can't I can't follow anything anybody saying like

1401
01:24:21.46 --> 01:24:25.74
my attention span is like two seconds or I mean given the brief and I'm not interested

1402
01:24:25.74 --> 01:24:29.46
in like you know but their team guys so they're still getting after it but they just don't

1403
01:24:29.46 --> 01:24:34.18
feel like getting after it and they're like basically I'm getting colder weaker fatter

1404
01:24:34.18 --> 01:24:38.18
you know like they're following the nutritionist advice they're following the strength and conditioning

1405
01:24:38.18 --> 01:24:41.90
advice they're doing everything exactly how they should do it and they just they're getting

1406
01:24:41.90 --> 01:24:46.74
weaker they're getting fatter and slower they're getting moody sex drives down sexual performance

1407
01:24:46.74 --> 01:24:53.58
is down right and it's really all performance issues right so I'm not as fast I'm not as

1408
01:24:53.58 --> 01:24:57.38
strong I'm not and then they'd be like you know but maybe I'm just getting old and I'm

1409
01:24:57.38 --> 01:25:04.18
like yeah man you're 34 like it's over for you right you're screwed you might as good

1410
01:25:04.18 --> 01:25:12.06
sex start your cigarette now man and so I honestly didn't have the slightest idea first

1411
01:25:12.06 --> 01:25:17.78
guy comes in my office and tells me that's something I'm bewildered I don't know so

1412
01:25:17.78 --> 01:25:24.38
I'm like I'm gonna do a bunch of labs and I mean it's first important to preface this

1413
01:25:24.38 --> 01:25:31.58
with when I first got there the department had was actually a PA so a physician's assistant

1414
01:25:31.58 --> 01:25:37.90
was supervising the physician and he'd been in Navy line where he's a former team guy

1415
01:25:37.90 --> 01:25:41.70
and one of the first things he tells me in his office he's like hey these guys are gonna

1416
01:25:41.70 --> 01:25:47.82
come to you and expect some special treatment I'm like yeah like we can't give it to him

1417
01:25:47.82 --> 01:25:54.10
like why wouldn't I give it to him he's like you have to treat everybody the same like

1418
01:25:54.10 --> 01:25:58.06
no it's in the name special forces like they get special treatment like we're we're here

1419
01:25:58.06 --> 01:26:01.46
because of the team guys we're not here for tech support like those guys can go to the

1420
01:26:01.46 --> 01:26:05.38
hospital right like if we have the capacity we'll see them but like I'm here to help the

1421
01:26:05.38 --> 01:26:09.18
team guys he's like you can't think of it that way and I'm like we're not gonna get

1422
01:26:09.18 --> 01:26:12.46
along then because that's what I'm gonna do like I'm here to help I'm here to help the

1423
01:26:12.46 --> 01:26:18.38
community I'm gonna give a shit my my CO was a supply officer right a group one I'm gonna

1424
01:26:18.38 --> 01:26:27.94
show you guys I'm gonna help my boys man I'm gonna do it so so everything I did was in

1425
01:26:27.94 --> 01:26:34.10
that vein and I and it wasn't popular it wasn't popular with the seals is popular with the

1426
01:26:34.10 --> 01:26:40.38
seals so they came in and they tell me this story about all this stuff and nothing they're

1427
01:26:40.38 --> 01:26:45.14
saying and this is just like repeal go one guy a day one guy a week you know how it goes

1428
01:26:45.14 --> 01:26:49.90
like word of mouth so like one and then one and one and then two and then four and and

1429
01:26:49.90 --> 01:26:56.70
you know I'd say three months after the first guy came in and I'd probably seen a hundred

1430
01:26:56.70 --> 01:27:01.50
guys right and they'll I mean I could have told them their story but I'd listen I take

1431
01:27:01.50 --> 01:27:06.98
notes and listen let them tell it and they all told me the same thing they've since they

1432
01:27:06.98 --> 01:27:11.38
done some research and they're now calling this operator syndrome I was calling it the

1433
01:27:11.38 --> 01:27:17.90
seal syndrome and the syndrome basically means here's all the symptoms we don't know why and

1434
01:27:17.90 --> 01:27:24.46
so it's a syndrome right and so I didn't I'm just like well I'll just test a bunch of labs

1435
01:27:24.46 --> 01:27:30.70
and see like I don't know I was doing 98 blood markers so they're going to the hospital

1436
01:27:30.70 --> 01:27:37.58
again like 17 vials of blood and then again everything that should be high was low everything

1437
01:27:37.58 --> 01:27:43.98
should be low was high like their anabolic behavior super low catablog stuff really high

1438
01:27:43.98 --> 01:27:50.22
their inflammation really high oxidation really high insulin sensitivity even nowhere

1439
01:27:50.22 --> 01:27:54.50
near what you would expect it to be when I got this fit and this and shape and this eating

1440
01:27:54.50 --> 01:28:03.26
this way and I have this last idea honestly I don't know I don't know and then I don't

1441
01:28:03.26 --> 01:28:12.22
know maybe 50 or 60 guys into it somebody said to me he takes Ambien every night and

1442
01:28:12.22 --> 01:28:18.86
I thought like I seem to say that yeah so I put a put a miss it I remember like one

1443
01:28:18.86 --> 01:28:23.10
of the few days I was in khakis like somebody just remember she's super clear like way I

1444
01:28:23.10 --> 01:28:28.14
sit in my desk and like remember putting this note the margin and then after he left I kept

1445
01:28:28.14 --> 01:28:33.22
shadow files because none of the team guys wanted stuff in the record so I'm like I'm

1446
01:28:33.22 --> 01:28:38.22
just keep a shadow file I give it to you when you leave you know or when I leave mean you

1447
01:28:38.22 --> 01:28:43.82
do what you want to with it so I checked in my shadow files every single guy who'd been

1448
01:28:43.82 --> 01:28:49.86
my office was an ambient 100% of them and I was like huh I wonder if that could be it

1449
01:28:49.86 --> 01:28:56.62
now I took pharmacology in medical school so I knew how Ambien worked but I didn't know

1450
01:28:56.62 --> 01:29:03.10
enough of like I knew it acts like GABA right GABA is a neuropeptide and like you heard

1451
01:29:03.10 --> 01:29:07.06
GABA pentane you give it for nerve pain because it slows down their function essentially right

1452
01:29:07.06 --> 01:29:12.54
okay and I'm like but I don't know enough about sleep to know why that's significant

1453
01:29:12.54 --> 01:29:18.14
what GABA does in sleep I don't know I didn't have a single class on sleep in medical school

1454
01:29:18.14 --> 01:29:28.14
and you know the way the pharmaceutical industry works you know when they apply for FDA approval

1455
01:29:28.14 --> 01:29:31.86
they own the research and they give the FDA what they want to give them they don't give

1456
01:29:31.86 --> 01:29:35.90
them what they don't want to give them but then if they ever get sued in court they have

1457
01:29:35.90 --> 01:29:40.46
to pull up the skirt and show everything so that had happened with Ambien like right before

1458
01:29:40.46 --> 01:29:47.94
this happened and so they were getting sued and so now we knew the real side effect profile

1459
01:29:47.94 --> 01:29:54.46
and so I just had to learn a ton about non-traditional medicine had to learn a ton about sleep I thought

1460
01:29:54.46 --> 01:30:00.90
maybe it was adrenal fatigue like I was trying which isn't even like a real thing but yeah

1461
01:30:00.90 --> 01:30:04.30
that was kind of like the alternative medicine thing with all the adrenal fatigue it's like

1462
01:30:04.30 --> 01:30:10.70
an HPA mismatch that there's some validity to it but it's really not like the way it's

1463
01:30:10.70 --> 01:30:17.22
proposed but I was having some success doing that like but it wasn't huge and then but

1464
01:30:17.22 --> 01:30:21.38
I'd noticed like everybody's testosterone was low everybody's growth hormone was low

1465
01:30:21.38 --> 01:30:29.50
like low low right but in medicine like I'm a western trained medical physician right

1466
01:30:29.50 --> 01:30:34.26
so I know how to recognize and treat disease what do I do if it's not disease right it's

1467
01:30:34.26 --> 01:30:42.46
within the bell curve but it probably should be higher but there's no right so the chair

1468
01:30:42.46 --> 01:30:47.98
at UCLA the chair of endocrinology at UCLA had done this research where he stratified

1469
01:30:47.98 --> 01:30:55.14
the bell curve for testosterone and broke it into quintiles so 80% to 160 to 80 right

1470
01:30:55.14 --> 01:31:02.10
and the top quintile you had the lowest risk of death for many cause lowest risk of any

1471
01:31:02.10 --> 01:31:06.66
disease every quintile you go down it doubles so about time you're in the fifth quintile

1472
01:31:06.66 --> 01:31:12.06
that's 16 times you're 16 times more likely to die of any cause you're 16 times more

1473
01:31:12.06 --> 01:31:17.46
likely to have any disease every guy who came in to see me was in that quintile now if that

1474
01:31:17.46 --> 01:31:22.74
were magnesium it would be medical malpractice to not give everybody magnesium and keep them

1475
01:31:22.74 --> 01:31:27.70
in the upper quintile but because athletes use tear testosterone cheat and sports it's

1476
01:31:27.70 --> 01:31:32.26
political so you don't give that right that's a no no so I wasn't about they weren't about

1477
01:31:32.26 --> 01:31:36.46
to let me give guys testosterone but then I learned hey when you're sleeping that's when

1478
01:31:36.46 --> 01:31:40.58
your testosterone is made that's when everything's rebalanced all your hormones the most anabolic

1479
01:31:40.58 --> 01:31:45.18
time in your life is the first sleep cycle right you go through your first sleep cycle

1480
01:31:45.18 --> 01:31:51.30
and most the most of that is deep sleep deep sleep has the lowest stress hormones the catabolic

1481
01:31:51.30 --> 01:31:58.90
hormones that you'll ever have in 24 hours and and has the highest anabolic so most of

1482
01:31:58.90 --> 01:32:02.62
your repair right obviously when you work out you don't get stronger you weaker you

1483
01:32:02.62 --> 01:32:08.10
damage yourself when it repairs it comes back stronger well that's happening while you're

1484
01:32:08.10 --> 01:32:14.10
sleeping so I thought so once I learned like what goes on when you go to sleep and what

1485
01:32:14.10 --> 01:32:18.74
I had going for me was you know the teams had already done some great work and I had

1486
01:32:18.74 --> 01:32:24.78
a great reputation because this is like 2009 right 2010 and so I could call up anybody

1487
01:32:24.78 --> 01:32:31.38
be like hey I read your book or saw your Ted talk or heard your lecture and I'm the doctor

1488
01:32:31.38 --> 01:32:34.94
for the West Coast sealed team so it's wonderful if I could train with you or consult with

1489
01:32:34.94 --> 01:32:39.30
you own clients whatever everybody was like here to help right so I got to learn a lot

1490
01:32:39.30 --> 01:32:46.18
really quickly and I start and I started trying to tell the leadership that I thought that

1491
01:32:46.18 --> 01:32:53.18
a lot of our performance issues are chronic injuries and are you know just guys not feeling

1492
01:32:53.18 --> 01:33:00.06
good not performing well not feeling motivated not being resilient I said I think a lot of

1493
01:33:00.06 --> 01:33:05.22
this is from their hormones I have the proof that their hormones are they have the hormones

1494
01:33:05.22 --> 01:33:13.46
of an 80 year old man and an 80 year old fat man actually and and I said I think it's

1495
01:33:13.46 --> 01:33:18.34
sleep was that everybody was like that I remember you I remember you talking to me you're like

1496
01:33:18.34 --> 01:33:22.18
I mean I was good and you know like you're like dude you're free you told me I had the

1497
01:33:22.18 --> 01:33:28.14
test officer 17 year old football player I was like yes yes there there are some people

1498
01:33:28.14 --> 01:33:34.06
who who just get through like for whatever reason they stay resilient you know but but

1499
01:33:34.06 --> 01:33:38.46
but I obviously have a biased sample because people are coming to me because they have

1500
01:33:38.46 --> 01:33:42.42
problems like everybody I see you were just getting me because I was retiring and like

1501
01:33:42.42 --> 01:33:46.66
here I am right I got it so most of the guys were coming to you they feel like shit yeah

1502
01:33:46.66 --> 01:33:51.22
and they're just coming to you like broke and you please help me right so then once I figured

1503
01:33:51.22 --> 01:33:56.70
out the ambient thing I started digging into that which by the way I've never taken ambient

1504
01:33:56.70 --> 01:34:04.34
yeah you're super unique yeah I had had the Corman pulled pull medical records and look

1505
01:34:04.34 --> 01:34:10.58
and 85% of our command of the West 85% of the West Coast seal teams had a prescription

1506
01:34:10.58 --> 01:34:14.34
for ambient yeah whether or not they were taking it I don't know but like my doc we're

1507
01:34:14.34 --> 01:34:20.10
on deployment my doc's like hey hey we need to get my he was like see I even need to tell

1508
01:34:20.10 --> 01:34:23.58
me but he was just telling me like hey we're out of ambient yeah like we're almost out

1509
01:34:23.58 --> 01:34:27.38
of ambient I got to get more I'm going to whatever and I was kind of like didn't really

1510
01:34:27.38 --> 01:34:30.66
think much of it because like I said I'd never I've never even tried it I don't even know

1511
01:34:30.66 --> 01:34:35.90
what it feels like but guys were freaking on ambient like it was like it was yeah eat

1512
01:34:35.90 --> 01:34:42.06
an M&M's man right and so what is it does it jack up your yes so they thought so the

1513
01:34:42.06 --> 01:34:47.98
way they used to get people to sleep was with Benzo's like volume right and turns out if

1514
01:34:47.98 --> 01:34:52.50
you overdose on those you quit breathing and you die and they're super hard to get off

1515
01:34:52.50 --> 01:34:58.58
of right that's what happened to Jordan Peterson like super hard to get off of so they found

1516
01:34:58.58 --> 01:35:05.46
these Z-drugs so GABA is this neuropeptide that basically slows neurons down right so

1517
01:35:05.46 --> 01:35:10.82
when you're when you go to sleep one of the primary things that's happening asleep is

1518
01:35:10.82 --> 01:35:14.42
your neocortex so the part of the brain that you think of as the human brain the wrinkly

1519
01:35:14.42 --> 01:35:18.62
bit that's where like all your motor function is all your sensory and all your processing

1520
01:35:18.62 --> 01:35:23.06
of that like your interpretation of the world that's how you interact with the world was

1521
01:35:23.06 --> 01:35:29.10
that part right so that that slows down and you quit interacting with the world quit paying

1522
01:35:29.10 --> 01:35:33.30
attention your senses still work obviously right because I can turn on the light and

1523
01:35:33.30 --> 01:35:37.62
your eyes still sense the light you'll wake up right I can make a loud noise so you're

1524
01:35:37.62 --> 01:35:41.46
all your senses are still working you're just not paying attention to them so GABA is the

1525
01:35:41.46 --> 01:35:47.94
primary neuropeptide that's making that happen so pharmaceutical industry the way they work

1526
01:35:47.94 --> 01:35:53.14
is like well if we figure out this one step of this process then we can supercharge that

1527
01:35:53.14 --> 01:35:58.02
step right so now this is going to bind a GABA receptor but it's going to do a hundred

1528
01:35:58.02 --> 01:36:06.02
times more than GABA does and that was benzos and then the Z-jugs like a thousand times

1529
01:36:06.02 --> 01:36:12.22
what GABA does what's a Z I don't know I can't like another brand name or another form that's

1530
01:36:12.22 --> 01:36:16.82
a category so that's like Ambien and Lunesta and there used to be a third one I can't remember

1531
01:36:16.82 --> 01:36:20.34
and these are like a thousand times that's a thousand times the effect of GABA so what

1532
01:36:20.34 --> 01:36:28.10
was happening is just dissociating people so so they would take this and basically

1533
01:36:28.10 --> 01:36:33.10
they quit interpreting their senses but they could still be awake and so the reason they

1534
01:36:33.10 --> 01:36:37.22
were getting sued is people were like driving down and doing a lizard brain stuff they're

1535
01:36:37.22 --> 01:36:43.54
driving down picking up prostitutes they're driving down and eating you know oh god fifty

1536
01:36:43.54 --> 01:36:48.94
hundred dollars worth of fast food they're going to Vegas and gambling their life savings

1537
01:36:48.94 --> 01:36:53.62
away and mortgaging their house and and wake up the next day down here remember it you

1538
01:36:53.62 --> 01:36:57.38
have no recollection of it whatsoever and so that's what they start that's what they're

1539
01:36:57.38 --> 01:37:04.14
getting sued for is it somewhat addictive to Ambien it is for this reason so so yeah

1540
01:37:04.14 --> 01:37:08.98
the first thing that happens obviously the blue light goes out of our eyes that chain

1541
01:37:08.98 --> 01:37:14.66
that makes some changes in our brain and act and melatonin gets created everybody's heard

1542
01:37:14.66 --> 01:37:20.02
of that this and it's a hormone in your brain and that's like the initiation of everything

1543
01:37:20.02 --> 01:37:24.94
right that's the as Matt Walker calls it the starter pistol which I think is a great metaphor

1544
01:37:24.94 --> 01:37:29.18
so that initiates everything and then one of the primary things that happen is GABA

1545
01:37:29.18 --> 01:37:32.22
comes in and slows down the brain you quit paying attention to your environment your

1546
01:37:32.22 --> 01:37:39.38
body temperature goes down and like that's what makes you feel sleepy so if your your

1547
01:37:39.38 --> 01:37:43.18
body is a really smart machine right it's efficient it's not going to do anything it

1548
01:37:43.18 --> 01:37:47.34
doesn't need to do that's why if I give you testosterone you quit making testosterone

1549
01:37:47.34 --> 01:37:52.50
why the hell are you going to spend energy making it you're getting it for free so if

1550
01:37:52.50 --> 01:37:59.94
I give you GABA and it's having a thousand times the effect of GABA or I'm sorry if

1551
01:37:59.94 --> 01:38:04.26
I give you a Z-Drag it's having a thousand times the effect of GABA all the receptors

1552
01:38:04.26 --> 01:38:09.18
for GABA we only need one one thousandth of them because you have all you have all of

1553
01:38:09.18 --> 01:38:16.06
this freaking GABA everywhere it's like you don't need all these receptors you know so

1554
01:38:16.06 --> 01:38:22.58
what happens is you down regulate receptors and now you quit taking that your GABA deficient

1555
01:38:22.58 --> 01:38:25.74
no matter how much GABA you have in your brain because you need a thousand times what you

1556
01:38:25.74 --> 01:38:29.90
would ordinarily have just to be normal now because you have so few receptors and then

1557
01:38:29.90 --> 01:38:33.78
the receptors take six to eight weeks to come back nobody can wait six to eight weeks to

1558
01:38:33.78 --> 01:38:38.42
start sleeping again right so they get they're really hard to get off of too sure that's

1559
01:38:38.42 --> 01:38:43.26
why the ambient becomes addictive yeah so people can't quit it because it's just making

1560
01:38:43.26 --> 01:38:47.74
them normal it's the same thing when people take you know 50 milligrams or even 10 milligrams

1561
01:38:47.74 --> 01:38:52.70
of melatonin it's like your brain only makes about six micrograms from the time the sun

1562
01:38:52.70 --> 01:38:58.10
goes down until you wake up you're taking 10 milligrams all at once way more than you're

1563
01:38:58.10 --> 01:39:02.14
and you're going to down regulate receptors and now when you quit taking melatonin your

1564
01:39:02.14 --> 01:39:05.90
melatonin deficient because you don't have enough receptors how long does it take to

1565
01:39:05.90 --> 01:39:09.66
get back to where you're producing melatonin again well you're still producing it it's

1566
01:39:09.66 --> 01:39:13.46
just like you're producing a normal amount with maybe a tenth or one hundredth of the

1567
01:39:13.46 --> 01:39:18.06
receptors so you're deficient because you need both it doesn't matter how much do you

1568
01:39:18.06 --> 01:39:22.86
get them back eventually receptors yeah it takes like six to eight weeks that is you

1569
01:39:22.86 --> 01:39:27.34
know SSRIs are very similar like they're working on serotonin reuptake and they're working

1570
01:39:27.34 --> 01:39:31.46
on receptors and takes like six to eight weeks to really start working and takes six to eight

1571
01:39:31.46 --> 01:39:39.10
weeks to recover from and guys that do testosterone you do you ever start making that again if

1572
01:39:39.10 --> 01:39:43.58
you go on if you're on testosterone it depends on how long you're on and what you do while

1573
01:39:43.58 --> 01:39:48.70
you're on it right so there are things that you can do to maintain testicular volume and

1574
01:39:48.70 --> 01:39:56.66
function most doc in the box guys don't do this you know they're just like here's what

1575
01:39:56.66 --> 01:40:02.34
does testosterone and then and most of the most of the guys that I end up seeing yeah

1576
01:40:02.34 --> 01:40:06.18
they're they're being seen by some guy who's given them like two or three hundred milligrams

1577
01:40:06.18 --> 01:40:10.54
once a week or once every two weeks so it's getting like this huge surge they're going

1578
01:40:10.54 --> 01:40:16.06
super physiologic for a few days turn into a caveman for like two days and then they

1579
01:40:16.06 --> 01:40:20.74
down regulate their receptors and that testosterone gets converted into estrogen and estrogen

1580
01:40:20.74 --> 01:40:24.90
is the signal in your brain to tell your brain how much testosterone you have so if your

1581
01:40:24.90 --> 01:40:30.54
estrogen is high your brain assumes that from testosterone so now you quit producing as

1582
01:40:30.54 --> 01:40:36.50
much testosterone and so they get this peak now they down regulate their receptors right

1583
01:40:36.50 --> 01:40:40.66
and they down regulate their own production and so after a few months of that once all

1584
01:40:40.66 --> 01:40:45.66
the receptors have changed and all the physiologies change now they're super physiologic for

1585
01:40:45.66 --> 01:40:50.34
maybe a day or two and they're normal for a day or two and now they're low the whole

1586
01:40:50.34 --> 01:40:54.22
rest of the time some guys that's two weeks and so they'll always come in and be like

1587
01:40:54.22 --> 01:40:59.94
hey I started this and I felt great and now I feel just like I did before I started and

1588
01:40:59.94 --> 01:41:06.10
I'll say how much are you taking how often are they are they looking at your DHT are

1589
01:41:06.10 --> 01:41:09.14
they looking at your estrogen are they looking at your sex hormone binding globulin are they

1590
01:41:09.14 --> 01:41:11.90
looking like are they looking at anything other than your testosterone are they even

1591
01:41:11.90 --> 01:41:15.62
looking at your free testosterone because total testosterone really doesn't matter how much

1592
01:41:15.62 --> 01:41:24.42
of it is available and so like this is true with every hormone anything anything any hormone

1593
01:41:24.42 --> 01:41:30.06
I give you you're going to quit making it now there are things that I can there's things

1594
01:41:30.06 --> 01:41:34.86
I can give you that will cause you to keep making testosterone while you're taking testosterone

1595
01:41:34.86 --> 01:41:40.70
it's not perfect but those guys that can come off of testosterone probably be okay there's

1596
01:41:40.70 --> 01:41:46.02
they're still going to be bad off right because they they weren't able to make enough when

1597
01:41:46.02 --> 01:41:50.82
I met them so now they're going to be a little worse than that when they got off and so like

1598
01:41:50.82 --> 01:41:55.18
what I was doing with the team guys is I was first doing it with like all supplements first

1599
01:41:55.18 --> 01:41:59.94
I was getting guys to sleep and getting them off of the ambient right and that's that just

1600
01:41:59.94 --> 01:42:03.14
came from me and I couldn't just say quit taking your ambient because our you know our

1601
01:42:03.14 --> 01:42:07.62
community one is good two is better and three is probably great so they're taking like three

1602
01:42:07.62 --> 01:42:13.22
ambient with we're taking seven they're taking three ambient with like a couple of cocktails

1603
01:42:13.22 --> 01:42:19.34
and then they're waking up at 430 not intentionally you know they're waking up at 430 and they're

1604
01:42:19.34 --> 01:42:22.50
like can't go back to sleep so I'm going to go in the gym I'm going to work out really

1605
01:42:22.50 --> 01:42:25.30
hard today I'm not going to take any breaks from work all day when I come home tonight

1606
01:42:25.30 --> 01:42:27.90
I'm going to be tired and I'll go to sleep like all right how long have you been doing

1607
01:42:27.90 --> 01:42:33.06
that like three years keep going tonight tonight I think right like obviously not that's not

1608
01:42:33.06 --> 01:42:41.18
that obviously is not working right and so like once I learned how ambient destroys REM

1609
01:42:41.18 --> 01:42:48.18
sleep like 80% of REM sleep goes away and it knocks out about 20% of deep sleep alcohol

1610
01:42:48.18 --> 01:42:55.78
to exactly the opposite so destroys deep sleep gets rid of about 20 so when I sent these guys

1611
01:42:55.78 --> 01:43:01.78
in for sleep studies 99.9% stage two sleep so they weren't getting any deep sleep any

1612
01:43:01.78 --> 01:43:05.90
REM sleep do they wake up in the morning feel like shit yeah how do they even I don't even

1613
01:43:05.90 --> 01:43:10.18
know how they survived it honestly like and that's one of the things about medicine proves

1614
01:43:10.18 --> 01:43:14.90
to you how little we know because that should kill them should kill them in a couple of

1615
01:43:14.90 --> 01:43:19.38
weeks because that's the same as getting no sleep you would think but this is what you

1616
01:43:19.38 --> 01:43:24.82
know the ambient lawsuits kind of were fortunately out to where I could learn all that and so

1617
01:43:24.82 --> 01:43:28.10
I couldn't just take away their ambient and alcohol and say suck it up buttercup right

1618
01:43:28.10 --> 01:43:31.90
like I had to give them something so I did some research and came up with a bunch of

1619
01:43:31.90 --> 01:43:36.06
things and they were having to go to all those pre-amazons they're having to drive around

1620
01:43:36.06 --> 01:43:40.26
to three different stores and get all the ingredients and try to travel with it and it was a pain

1621
01:43:40.26 --> 01:43:46.38
and so now they really have rang me into making a product out of it to make it easier for

1622
01:43:46.38 --> 01:43:56.38
them so I you know I figured out the sleep was a huge component and that that was causing

1623
01:43:56.38 --> 01:44:00.22
me to get a lot of their low testosterone and then there's things I can give you like

1624
01:44:00.22 --> 01:44:05.98
the precursors to testosterone like DHEA and you can do a form of DHEA 7 keto DHEA that

1625
01:44:05.98 --> 01:44:11.26
can't be converted into estrogen so that's good right I can give you zinc citrate which

1626
01:44:11.26 --> 01:44:19.54
will decrease the amount of estrogen you make from a testosterone and then like some guys

1627
01:44:19.54 --> 01:44:24.74
I was giving a pharmaceutical called a remodax and that blocks estrogen conversion to it's

1628
01:44:24.74 --> 01:44:34.38
called a roma tase inhibitor and so just with like DHEA pregnant alone which is another

1629
01:44:34.38 --> 01:44:40.10
precursor to the testosterone pathway and some zinc or a remodax and getting guys to

1630
01:44:40.10 --> 01:44:48.70
sleep guys are tripling quadrupling their testosterone levels over six months 46 months

1631
01:44:48.70 --> 01:44:57.42
right yeah I one of the CEOs out there he got like in the couple of years I was treating

1632
01:44:57.42 --> 01:45:02.62
him you know like three PRs like like weight lifting and running and like say something

1633
01:45:02.62 --> 01:45:08.66
else and like in his 40s like this is the best he's ever been in his life because he's you

1634
01:45:08.66 --> 01:45:14.06
know he's been broken down we and like our community has some of that just because of

1635
01:45:14.06 --> 01:45:19.50
the chaotic sleep anyway right just because well tonight you're working and then tomorrow

1636
01:45:19.50 --> 01:45:22.50
you're working too and then you know and now we're going to travel and we're going to

1637
01:45:22.50 --> 01:45:26.78
go over here we're going to do this and like and so every like you sleep when you can obviously

1638
01:45:26.78 --> 01:45:30.30
right and so it's chaotic and if you aren't aligned with your circadian rhythm sleep is

1639
01:45:30.30 --> 01:45:38.18
nowhere near as valuable and so I got I got guys sleeping they had huge performance gains

1640
01:45:38.18 --> 01:45:44.06
there are a few older guys that I couldn't get them to make enough testosterone to be

1641
01:45:44.06 --> 01:45:52.90
in the number one so I think when they they they like shut me down and have me under investigation

1642
01:45:52.90 --> 01:45:59.42
for a while and like I mean I essentially sacrificed my career for like there was no

1643
01:45:59.42 --> 01:46:03.06
way I was getting any kind of Navy residency or anything because I was just in trouble

1644
01:46:03.06 --> 01:46:09.38
all the time with Bumad or the hospital or Warcom whatever like everybody's then even

1645
01:46:09.38 --> 01:46:18.94
like my name out about that I was practicing outside of my scope that I was like I was

1646
01:46:18.94 --> 01:46:25.58
giving people was called Myers cocktails when I thought that it was adrenal fatigue IV vitamins

1647
01:46:25.58 --> 01:46:29.98
apparently I'm not allowed to do that as a doctor and I got in a lot of trouble for

1648
01:46:29.98 --> 01:46:37.42
that the aromatics ignorant doctors will say to cancer drug why you in somebody cancer

1649
01:46:37.42 --> 01:46:42.74
drug it's not a cancer drug you moron I mean you give it to women with breast cancer because

1650
01:46:42.74 --> 01:46:46.94
their breast cancer is estrogen sensitive and you want them to make less estrogen that's

1651
01:46:46.94 --> 01:46:51.18
nothing you do with cancer like you just don't want them to have estrogen it's an estrogen

1652
01:46:51.18 --> 01:46:59.30
blocker that's all it is so yeah I just like everything I did you know and all it takes

1653
01:46:59.30 --> 01:47:03.54
because I was a junior doctor right like all it takes is for somebody senior to me anywhere

1654
01:47:03.54 --> 01:47:07.98
in the medical chain be like he's doing what why is he doing that like no we can't allow

1655
01:47:07.98 --> 01:47:14.26
that and so then they call Warcom and complain that this rogue doctor is doing all this crazy

1656
01:47:14.26 --> 01:47:20.30
voodoo stuff that's what it's called like voodoo and when even when I when I told the leadership

1657
01:47:20.30 --> 01:47:31.42
Andrew or was crown guard with Alex Alex Cron guard he was the Commodore at the time

1658
01:47:31.42 --> 01:47:37.26
and he was super receptive leave he's smart educated on all the stuff but everybody else

1659
01:47:37.26 --> 01:47:44.02
like literally laughs me out of their office going you gotta be kidding me their testosterone

1660
01:47:44.02 --> 01:47:50.42
low because they aren't sleeping right doc like you got some problems and but then started

1661
01:47:50.42 --> 01:47:55.38
getting results and people started performing better and word of mouth spread and then they

1662
01:47:55.38 --> 01:48:00.42
started having me lecture at the pre and post retreats and then I you know that's when I

1663
01:48:00.42 --> 01:48:07.22
like was sharing the stage with like Rob Wolfe and well-born and Cressor and like all those

1664
01:48:07.22 --> 01:48:11.42
guys and then they started inviting me on podcast and invited me to other symposiums

1665
01:48:11.42 --> 01:48:16.34
and stuff and like that's kind of where my career went because of what I was doing with

1666
01:48:16.34 --> 01:48:21.70
our with our guys so what what year did you end up getting out of the Navy January 13

1667
01:48:21.70 --> 01:48:27.90
so you retired from the Navy of January 13 I didn't retire but I got 19 years you see

1668
01:48:27.90 --> 01:48:37.34
this yeah yeah well well so but medical school is like the Academy so it only counts retro

1669
01:48:37.34 --> 01:48:42.94
so you have to do 24 years to retire so I would have to stand five more years okay and

1670
01:48:42.94 --> 01:48:47.46
there was there was nowhere for me to go I mean let's get it up in Antarctica or something

1671
01:48:47.46 --> 01:48:52.02
yeah yeah I'd burn I'd burned a lot of bridges to do what I did yeah so then what'd you do

1672
01:48:52.02 --> 01:48:57.02
when you punched out so you kind of had a win worked at the concierge practice and in

1673
01:48:57.02 --> 01:49:02.94
point Loma with the doctor who talked me into becoming a doctor and then he wanted me to

1674
01:49:02.94 --> 01:49:08.22
see him in that practice and take it over and it was exactly what I thought I wanted

1675
01:49:08.22 --> 01:49:12.38
you know and I was already doing some private consulting people heard me on podcast and

1676
01:49:12.38 --> 01:49:17.66
be like hey I want to work with you so it's sort of telemedicine like zoom stuff Skype

1677
01:49:17.66 --> 01:49:24.02
in those days I guess and so I was doing some of that and then but of course when I left

1678
01:49:24.02 --> 01:49:29.86
I created like this vacuum because the next guy who came to the teams was just like a doctor

1679
01:49:29.86 --> 01:49:33.94
like regular doctor is just waiting biting his time you try and do like a turnover of

1680
01:49:33.94 --> 01:49:39.14
what you had learned with him yeah but but he was like I want to I want to stay in the

1681
01:49:39.14 --> 01:49:42.82
Navy yeah after seeing what happened to me there wasn't anybody who's going to be interested

1682
01:49:42.82 --> 01:49:47.50
in doing what I done has the world caught up with these protocols yeah yeah like I'd

1683
01:49:47.50 --> 01:49:53.02
say maybe four or five years after I got out like so come hired me to come and lecture

1684
01:49:53.02 --> 01:49:57.62
there and like lecture all their medical staff and like damn neck hired me to come in do lecture

1685
01:49:57.62 --> 01:50:04.06
and teach all their medical staff and I consult on all those guys on a fairly regular basis

1686
01:50:04.06 --> 01:50:09.18
is the H. Liddell Hart who wrote the book called he wrote a bunch of countless books

1687
01:50:09.18 --> 01:50:16.38
but you know he's a he's a world war one guy fought at the song he wrote the book that

1688
01:50:16.38 --> 01:50:20.62
I love called the indirect approach but one of the things he says in that book is the

1689
01:50:20.62 --> 01:50:26.98
first person with an idea if they stick with that idea and they hold on to it guess what

1690
01:50:26.98 --> 01:50:32.66
they become a martyr so you look out through throughout history like you have an idea and

1691
01:50:32.66 --> 01:50:36.98
you you're like hey this is the way it should be you end up a martyr and that's kind of

1692
01:50:36.98 --> 01:50:40.74
like what happened to you because it takes a while for ideas to get accepted he he rolls

1693
01:50:40.74 --> 01:50:46.98
out this one example of with the major changes that have been made to warships over the past

1694
01:50:46.98 --> 01:50:53.86
whatever it is 200 years every major change that came like no one accepted it until like

1695
01:50:53.86 --> 01:51:01.42
somebody got martyred and then you know like going from whatever from sale to like steam

1696
01:51:01.42 --> 01:51:04.74
right this first guy's like are you an idiot what are you gonna do when you're out at sea

1697
01:51:04.74 --> 01:51:09.62
and there's no coal you're an idiot like we can sail forever and sure enough these guys

1698
01:51:09.62 --> 01:51:13.66
get fired and then the next guy says you know we should make the holes out of out of metal

1699
01:51:13.66 --> 01:51:17.30
and set a wood were you an idiot how are you gonna repair those they're heavier than

1700
01:51:17.30 --> 01:51:22.06
more all those things and that's what happens so if you're the if you're the first person

1701
01:51:22.06 --> 01:51:27.86
to roll out if you're not careful now you can be careful you can get it done in a more this

1702
01:51:27.86 --> 01:51:31.46
is what he talks about yeah a more indirect manner so if you had said all right I'm gonna

1703
01:51:31.46 --> 01:51:34.82
be like super strategic and I'm gonna run this up the chain it would have taken longer

1704
01:51:34.82 --> 01:51:38.02
you had to you had to tell a bunch of guys I can't do anything for you now you know it

1705
01:51:38.02 --> 01:51:41.50
would have taken you seven years or whatever right so I'm not saying it would have been

1706
01:51:41.50 --> 01:51:46.34
it just a that indirect approach is how is the only way to well not the only way but

1707
01:51:46.34 --> 01:51:50.98
it's probably the only way to avoid becoming a martyr but for you you're sitting there

1708
01:51:50.98 --> 01:51:53.82
looking at people that are hurting and you're like all right I'm gonna help you guys need

1709
01:51:53.82 --> 01:51:58.62
help right now like it's totally totally worth it like I was fully aware of what I was doing

1710
01:51:58.62 --> 01:52:03.90
I'm not I'm not whining about it like I knew what I was doing at the time I had a quote

1711
01:52:03.90 --> 01:52:12.30
taped in my monitor from Buckminster Fuller said it said never fight the system create

1712
01:52:12.30 --> 01:52:18.18
a superior system to make the old one obsolete so it's like I'm just gonna do the right thing

1713
01:52:18.18 --> 01:52:23.26
because like I learned all this stuff from other people right it's not like I invented

1714
01:52:23.26 --> 01:52:28.66
right what I was doing I mean I had a few novel ideas but for the most part like I learned

1715
01:52:28.66 --> 01:52:32.74
all this from other people so this was going on in the world it wasn't going on in our

1716
01:52:32.74 --> 01:52:38.74
world and now it's in our world like you know but I left this back and when I left and so

1717
01:52:38.74 --> 01:52:43.90
all these guys kept coming to me like when they got when they got out especially and

1718
01:52:43.90 --> 01:52:49.90
I don't know if you do you know anything about the honor the honor foundation yeah yeah

1719
01:52:49.90 --> 01:52:54.26
I mean I definitely know about it yeah for sure so Joe Musselman was spoken there a couple

1720
01:52:54.26 --> 01:53:00.54
times yeah so Joe Musselman was the guy who found out he's a guy didn't make three buds

1721
01:53:00.54 --> 01:53:06.38
and he wanted to do this educational component of it and I'd seen enough team guys like these

1722
01:53:06.38 --> 01:53:10.74
guys need a medical rehab that year too right so like educate them for a year but like let's

1723
01:53:10.74 --> 01:53:14.10
get them in medical shape first so that they can actually learn so they can remember they

1724
01:53:14.10 --> 01:53:18.94
can sleep they can right and so they're not emotional wrecks and you know racked with

1725
01:53:18.94 --> 01:53:25.86
anxiety and all those and all this other stuff and so we pitched that's how I got back and

1726
01:53:25.86 --> 01:53:31.26
involved with Dr. Rice a guy who talked to me in medical school is he had this great

1727
01:53:31.26 --> 01:53:37.42
clinic and Point Loma is huge and he had very few patients and so he had the clinical space

1728
01:53:37.42 --> 01:53:42.70
and we're like so we pitched him like hey man could we run like this pilot program through

1729
01:53:42.70 --> 01:53:46.94
here and we were trying to raise money for that and the money just wasn't there for the

1730
01:53:46.94 --> 01:53:52.86
medical because it's too expensive but we did like I think we did like 10 families like

1731
01:53:52.86 --> 01:53:59.02
team team guys family or something proof of concept and so and then I would and then I

1732
01:53:59.02 --> 01:54:03.90
ended up working at the clinic instead of just doing my plan was to do that like to build

1733
01:54:03.90 --> 01:54:07.98
that because all that everybody was calling me anyways all the team guys are calling me

1734
01:54:07.98 --> 01:54:16.38
anyway and they're still to this day like I'm always managing 50 guys and you're one they

1735
01:54:16.38 --> 01:54:21.50
trust me to I know our community better than anybody and I know what they need I know what

1736
01:54:21.50 --> 01:54:29.62
their problems are before they even know their problems are and so I was like that's kind

1737
01:54:29.62 --> 01:54:33.86
of been my philanthropic work it's just like I just kept you do that for civilians.

1738
01:54:33.86 --> 01:54:39.06
As well I do it for civilians and they pay me they pay me a lot so that I don't have

1739
01:54:39.06 --> 01:54:44.34
to charge the team guys and up until just recently like I'm on a bunch of different advisory

1740
01:54:44.34 --> 01:54:51.86
boards for the nonprofits who are trying to help our guys out and so I've never charged

1741
01:54:51.86 --> 01:54:57.66
any of the team guys for my time but they have to pay for their meds because they're

1742
01:54:57.66 --> 01:55:02.10
not you know it's not coming through trichar and so now a lot of these foundations are

1743
01:55:02.10 --> 01:55:07.06
paying for their meds and so in the last couple of years like it's it's gotten a lot better

1744
01:55:07.06 --> 01:55:12.46
you know and there there's even I haven't seen any but I there's other doctors that

1745
01:55:12.46 --> 01:55:16.02
are doing this work with these foundations and they're they're treating some active duty

1746
01:55:16.02 --> 01:55:22.90
guys too so and then you ended up making your your sleep supplement too yeah so actually

1747
01:55:22.90 --> 01:55:31.90
when I was when I was at the I was at the clinic I was at the concierge clinic is life

1748
01:55:31.90 --> 01:55:36.34
wellness by the way give him a shout out maybe like wellness in point loma still still active

1749
01:55:36.34 --> 01:55:42.58
still there yeah life wellness institute of things called and you know so I worked there

1750
01:55:42.58 --> 01:55:49.90
for a year and I mean I just I just had so much there's so much demand for my time and

1751
01:55:49.90 --> 01:55:55.10
like there's no way I could do what I needed to do the team still hadn't caught up they

1752
01:55:55.10 --> 01:56:01.06
still aren't doing anything about sleep and so the guys were just kind of haranguing me

1753
01:56:01.06 --> 01:56:05.82
into like to just make a product like how hard is this to do I'm like all right like

1754
01:56:05.82 --> 01:56:09.70
I'll so I'm like I'm gonna step away from the clinic for a year I'm gonna start the sleep

1755
01:56:09.70 --> 01:56:14.82
supplement I'll just live off of my consulting and I think I was doing an hourly rate back

1756
01:56:14.82 --> 01:56:20.82
then I do like annual programs now but I said I'll just live off of my consulting I'll

1757
01:56:20.82 --> 01:56:25.06
start this thing up and I'm good go back and so your consulting is this medical consulting

1758
01:56:25.06 --> 01:56:30.74
for individual humans is that what yeah okay so I mean I do like I do some organizational

1759
01:56:30.74 --> 01:56:35.94
stuff like they'll like whatever law enforcement or professional sports team wherever they'll

1760
01:56:35.94 --> 01:56:41.34
hire me to lecture and kind of help them design a program you're talking about like hey I

1761
01:56:41.34 --> 01:56:46.54
want you to help me feel better yeah and so here's my money yeah so now I have now I now

1762
01:56:46.54 --> 01:56:51.02
I do annual programs people can only do a year like I won't I don't do multiple years

1763
01:56:51.02 --> 01:56:54.82
like I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know in a year you have to have another

1764
01:56:54.82 --> 01:57:00.02
doctor because I'm not I'm not your primary care or whatever yeah you gotta you gotta cold

1765
01:57:00.02 --> 01:57:04.66
you ever broken leg like that's not me so I and what I do is performance like I didn't

1766
01:57:04.66 --> 01:57:07.74
break I didn't call it that at the teams but if you think about that's exactly what it's

1767
01:57:07.74 --> 01:57:12.02
doing is performance right none these guys had a disease they just weren't performing

1768
01:57:12.02 --> 01:57:18.10
like they felt like they should perform and so so that that's what I do now and so it's

1769
01:57:18.10 --> 01:57:25.98
mainly like you know big executives or entrepreneurs traded their health for wealth for 20 or 30

1770
01:57:25.98 --> 01:57:30.82
years and now they had like a big exit whatever like you know they sold their company they

1771
01:57:30.82 --> 01:57:33.90
have a hundred million dollars don't care about money they want to buy that health they want

1772
01:57:33.90 --> 01:57:40.14
to be division one athletes again I'm like pump the brakes Sparky like maybe we can get

1773
01:57:40.14 --> 01:57:45.38
you we can drop 40 pounds of fat off you in the year and get you back into being able

1774
01:57:45.38 --> 01:57:52.46
to be physical and you know yeah so so yeah I I I charge those guys a lot of money one

1775
01:57:52.46 --> 01:57:58.94
to make sure that they're motivated and to just a pace for me to treat him guys and then

1776
01:57:58.94 --> 01:58:05.46
like right before I'd say like a year before I got out I was at a conference where a guy

1777
01:58:05.46 --> 01:58:11.82
was lecturing on TBI and I had at least one guy I knew that had TBI because that's this

1778
01:58:11.82 --> 01:58:16.42
is what we thought about TBI's in this time so you know if somebody hadn't been knocked

1779
01:58:16.42 --> 01:58:21.78
unconscious then you didn't think they had a TBI so then I went to this guy's lecture

1780
01:58:21.78 --> 01:58:28.62
and he was working with Pugelist and and some NFL guys he starts throwing up his case

1781
01:58:28.62 --> 01:58:37.22
reports and like looking at their blood markers like exactly like my guys you're kidding me

1782
01:58:37.22 --> 01:58:42.18
so then I start doing my own research and in 2009 there was a JAMA article written and

1783
01:58:42.18 --> 01:58:50.34
it was done between Cambridge and Harvard thousands of people and they they have this

1784
01:58:50.34 --> 01:58:58.38
imaging called DTI's and it's like it's so it's so the resolution so clear they can see

1785
01:58:58.38 --> 01:59:04.26
a single neuronal track breaking pain and they call that a minor TBI so they're like

1786
01:59:04.26 --> 01:59:13.06
what's the threshold it turns out is a 1.09 G's they got that from the 1.09 G's can cause

1787
01:59:13.06 --> 01:59:16.90
a minor TBI minor TBI they were getting that from the acceleration changes on a roller

1788
01:59:16.90 --> 01:59:22.90
coaster and I'm like I wonder how much our stuff is so I started investigating like you

1789
01:59:22.90 --> 01:59:28.06
know and this stuff we've tested like we haven't tested everything obviously but you know that

1790
01:59:28.06 --> 01:59:35.54
they're like the fat like damn next fast but they average 60 G's for hours they peak

1791
01:59:35.54 --> 01:59:41.78
over 100 G's so they're just like head injury head injury head injury like every freaking

1792
01:59:41.78 --> 01:59:49.94
wave right and then I started learning about over pressurization TBI right it's going to

1793
01:59:49.94 --> 01:59:55.94
be great and so I don't know what the threshold is for that but it's something close to that

1794
01:59:55.94 --> 02:00:03.34
one point around G's right well if you're if you're in a concrete room with three and

1795
02:00:03.34 --> 02:00:10.98
four is like every round that comes out as 30 G's if you're shooting a called Gustav

1796
02:00:10.98 --> 02:00:20.98
the shooter gets 200 G's the spotter gets like 300 G's you know the you know hard

1797
02:00:20.98 --> 02:00:27.74
parachute openings or two to three G's being in the back of a Humby with a 50 cal going

1798
02:00:27.74 --> 02:00:32.58
to like 60 G's every every round you know so I'm like well I don't have a guy who doesn't

1799
02:00:32.58 --> 02:00:39.46
have thousands of TBI's and this has now been proven and if you know Larkin Frank Larkin

1800
02:00:39.46 --> 02:00:46.98
and his son yeah suicide it and he had his brain analyzed and so when you look at if

1801
02:00:46.98 --> 02:00:53.30
you look at fighters and look at NFL's NFL guys they have the CT right you heard that

1802
02:00:53.30 --> 02:00:58.90
and it's like specific regions of the brain that's shows some specific abnormalities what

1803
02:00:58.90 --> 02:01:03.58
happens in the and the over pressurization is like that pressure wave goes through your

1804
02:01:03.58 --> 02:01:09.70
skull right it goes right through your skull and then they have it on photography now like

1805
02:01:09.70 --> 02:01:16.26
I guess it's what a lot of frames per second or so 60 frames per second or something I

1806
02:01:16.26 --> 02:01:23.38
can slow that down and get really resolute with it so as the as the wave comes by it's

1807
02:01:23.38 --> 02:01:27.86
just like any other way if it's moving it's having impact on the material that's going

1808
02:01:27.86 --> 02:01:33.98
through well the different densities move at different rates so the lining of your brain

1809
02:01:33.98 --> 02:01:37.90
the dura that moves at a different rate than the vasculature and that means that a different

1810
02:01:37.90 --> 02:01:41.70
rate than the white matter and that moves at a different rate than the gray matter and

1811
02:01:41.70 --> 02:01:46.02
that moves at a different rate than the little vesicles that hold the cerebral spinal fluid

1812
02:01:46.02 --> 02:01:52.34
so let's put it in a blender you just hear everything and we have and when you do autopsy

1813
02:01:52.34 --> 02:01:57.98
is on our guys he's so excited their entire brain is covered with these talphur genes like

1814
02:01:57.98 --> 02:02:03.78
these markers for damage at every interface so where where the vasculature meets the brain

1815
02:02:03.78 --> 02:02:06.70
where the dura meets the brain where the white matter meets the gray matter with gray matter

1816
02:02:06.70 --> 02:02:12.22
reach meets the cerebral spinal fluid the entire brain and we don't know what to do

1817
02:02:12.22 --> 02:02:18.98
about that now there's peptides out that we know help that's going to be the next that's

1818
02:02:18.98 --> 02:02:23.30
the next frontier of medicine I believe that's where I'm spending a lot of my time with our

1819
02:02:23.30 --> 02:02:33.46
guys now hyperbaric helps for sure hormones obviously help so you know that that's you

1820
02:02:33.46 --> 02:02:37.50
know that that's what that's what our guys need but this needs to be done proactively

1821
02:02:37.50 --> 02:02:42.78
because you think about it like over time the equipment just keeps getting more and more

1822
02:02:42.78 --> 02:02:50.02
dynamic the people inside the equipment are the same right we're the fragile bit now and

1823
02:02:50.02 --> 02:02:53.42
there's got to be like it's different for different people you always bring up George

1824
02:02:53.42 --> 02:02:57.54
Forman and Muhammad Ali like George Forman right now he's up there you know totally good

1825
02:02:57.54 --> 02:03:03.66
to go right and I've known a lot of fighters and some fighters are just like they're fine

1826
02:03:03.66 --> 02:03:07.34
right and some guys are not clearly and it's the same thing with football like you meet

1827
02:03:07.34 --> 02:03:10.46
guys that played football their whole life and then they went out and they're doing totally

1828
02:03:10.46 --> 02:03:14.46
normal things and other guys get totally messed up from football so there's got to be some

1829
02:03:14.46 --> 02:03:18.78
genetic component to it as well right yeah there's there's genetic variation to everything

1830
02:03:18.78 --> 02:03:26.82
right so and I don't know why anybody surprised by this right it's like you know we'd like

1831
02:03:26.82 --> 02:03:31.42
to say that all men are created equal it's not true this is like every people aren't

1832
02:03:31.42 --> 02:03:35.70
equal and some people have aptitudes that other people don't have you know it's like

1833
02:03:35.70 --> 02:03:41.86
this this this misnomer of the super sleeper right if you have this gene combination then

1834
02:03:41.86 --> 02:03:46.62
you don't need as much sleep it's not true you know what's true is that you don't suffer

1835
02:03:46.62 --> 02:03:51.70
as much as most people when you don't sleep right when you short when you short sleep

1836
02:03:51.70 --> 02:03:55.18
you don't have the same problems as the average Joe now there's somebody on the other side

1837
02:03:55.18 --> 02:04:00.78
of the spectrum too that you take a few hours of sleep away and they're completely incapacitated

1838
02:04:00.78 --> 02:04:03.26
these are people who don't make it through hell week these are people don't make it

1839
02:04:03.26 --> 02:04:08.46
into our community I've always well you know people always talk about my sleep and I the

1840
02:04:08.46 --> 02:04:14.42
genetic component I talk about because like my oldest daughter I would be going to bed

1841
02:04:14.42 --> 02:04:17.78
at 11 o'clock at night when she was in high school and she'd be up studying yeah and I'd

1842
02:04:17.78 --> 02:04:22.38
wake up at 430 in the morning and she'd be up studying and and so she was just kind of

1843
02:04:22.38 --> 02:04:28.98
like me right she didn't need a ton of sleep my wife like this girl's going to bed yeah

1844
02:04:28.98 --> 02:04:36.46
I mean she's going to bed and like she'll be up later right right my my middle daughter

1845
02:04:36.46 --> 02:04:40.70
if there's not an emergency going on she's in she's she's gonna get out of bed when

1846
02:04:40.70 --> 02:04:46.74
she feels like it like yeah there's not major emergency going on my son's kind of like

1847
02:04:46.74 --> 02:04:51.22
he can be he can deal without sleep pretty well and then my youngest daughter just like

1848
02:04:51.22 --> 02:04:56.46
my wife so it seems to me like and you know we all live in the same house right there's

1849
02:04:56.46 --> 02:05:00.66
like half of us get up early and are going to do something the other half are still in

1850
02:05:00.66 --> 02:05:05.38
bed and that's the way it is every day and it's not because I treated them any differently

1851
02:05:05.38 --> 02:05:08.94
yeah I wanted them all to get up early and some of them just it's not part of their gig

1852
02:05:08.94 --> 02:05:13.66
right it's not part of my wife's gig either people people say to me like how do you get

1853
02:05:13.66 --> 02:05:18.38
up in the morning like without waking up your wife my wife ain't waking up unless I start

1854
02:05:18.38 --> 02:05:23.86
firing weapons in the bedroom like I'm good to go that girl is she's out and she's in

1855
02:05:23.86 --> 02:05:28.38
her own little La La land which is awesome so it seems like there is a some level of

1856
02:05:28.38 --> 02:05:34.38
genetic component to it where and you know this even happened in the teams like I would

1857
02:05:34.38 --> 02:05:38.42
I definitely a hundred percent like I wouldn't need to sleep with at all and guys would be

1858
02:05:38.42 --> 02:05:42.10
like hey I need to go down and I get cool yeah go to sleep and I could go for a really

1859
02:05:42.10 --> 02:05:47.38
long time without you know on very little sleep and I've always been like that right

1860
02:05:47.38 --> 02:05:51.10
and so there's there's got to be some level of like and I'm not claiming to be like oh

1861
02:05:51.10 --> 02:05:55.54
I have some genetic gift but there's something like oh I can get by a little less you know

1862
02:05:55.54 --> 02:06:00.10
we can test your genetics and see if you're super sleepers I wouldn't be surprised if

1863
02:06:00.10 --> 02:06:04.38
I was and I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't you know I mean yeah it's super rare it's

1864
02:06:04.38 --> 02:06:08.30
like the everybody wants to put themselves in that category and we're like well I'm

1865
02:06:08.30 --> 02:06:13.30
just right and I'm not saying that I'm not I'm not saying this is you but well I just

1866
02:06:13.30 --> 02:06:16.98
kind of did that so I guess I'm guilty but no I actually don't think I really am yeah

1867
02:06:16.98 --> 02:06:21.86
I don't think I really am I think I I think you know I think the odds of being that is

1868
02:06:21.86 --> 02:06:26.94
something like being struck by lightning while being attacked by a shark right okay I mean

1869
02:06:26.94 --> 02:06:31.50
it's super super rare but I go to sleep but think about it's like anything else like how

1870
02:06:31.50 --> 02:06:37.34
much do you suffer from a ruck like you know you're gonna go do whatever 10 20 mile ruck

1871
02:06:37.34 --> 02:06:42.10
like how much are you gonna suffer does everybody suffer the same no right how much weight can

1872
02:06:42.10 --> 02:06:46.38
you lift the same as everybody else like if you train the same like if you're like yeah

1873
02:06:46.38 --> 02:06:49.50
how many how fast can you read how much do you retain like everybody's different than

1874
02:06:49.50 --> 02:06:58.14
everything how much sleep do people need eight hours so like I if I go to sleep I can't sleep

1875
02:06:58.14 --> 02:07:02.34
eight hours like I will not sleep eight hours and not because of how many do you sleep I

1876
02:07:02.34 --> 02:07:08.50
could have been at 10 30 wake up before 30 like that's kind of no seven hours six hours

1877
02:07:08.50 --> 02:07:12.70
six hours six hours six hours six hours and sometimes I go to bed at 10 you know like

1878
02:07:12.70 --> 02:07:17.90
they're six and a half hours but you know if I'm it's hard for me to sleep like I'll

1879
02:07:17.90 --> 02:07:22.94
be in some situation where you know whatever I go my wife and I go stay somewhere whatever

1880
02:07:22.94 --> 02:07:29.98
and we have we there's you know no what is it there's nothing to do right we're on vacation

1881
02:07:29.98 --> 02:07:34.22
for lack of a better word echo Charles we're cruising we're cruising and like I got a bed

1882
02:07:34.22 --> 02:07:39.34
and it's so annoying because you know like what like then I'm awake we're in some random

1883
02:07:39.34 --> 02:07:43.70
place and my wife's gonna sleep for more four more hours right now I'm like walking around

1884
02:07:43.70 --> 02:07:49.10
in circles doing burpees in my room yeah so yeah it'd be interesting you know what you

1885
02:07:49.10 --> 02:07:53.38
know what else was an interesting sleep experiment the arc did you ever do an arg platoon no

1886
02:07:53.38 --> 02:07:57.10
so I never I nearly avoided you go out on a ship and when you're out on a ship you have

1887
02:07:57.10 --> 02:08:00.90
no job as a seal you have no job and you're in this weird compartment where it's just

1888
02:08:00.90 --> 02:08:07.46
dark if you you know guys and we had guys I had a guy in one of my platoons he would

1889
02:08:07.46 --> 02:08:13.78
sleep for days I like seriously and and he was also a guy that probably had some kind

1890
02:08:13.78 --> 02:08:20.02
of a sleep disorder because he would fall asleep on patrol like we'd we'd be patrolling

1891
02:08:20.02 --> 02:08:23.74
and you know take a 10 minute break you know patrol for 50 minutes break for 10 patrol for

1892
02:08:23.74 --> 02:08:27.86
15 minutes break for 10 we'd be doing a hump across the desert we'd we'd sit down was an

1893
02:08:27.86 --> 02:08:34.10
older guy no no no he lives in Texas I'll introduce you to him but he we'd we'd like

1894
02:08:34.10 --> 02:08:38.38
take a break and you know you're like freaking sword you're humping through the desert thirsty

1895
02:08:38.38 --> 02:08:45.26
and all the three minutes in the break you hear like and he'd be snoring yeah but he

1896
02:08:45.26 --> 02:08:51.14
would go on the ship he would go on the ship sometimes he slept for like actual like like

1897
02:08:51.14 --> 02:08:56.90
18 hours you know and then he'd get up looking all groggy and so on the ship you could sleep

1898
02:08:56.90 --> 02:09:01.94
as much as you possibly could want I mean there's nothing to do like subops even yeah

1899
02:09:01.94 --> 02:09:05.94
I've something about same way even if you're the most like highly disciplined person and

1900
02:09:05.94 --> 02:09:09.38
you're trying to complete your degree and you're learning to play guitar and you're

1901
02:09:09.38 --> 02:09:14.86
working out you still have like an extra 17 hours to do nothing yeah so but even on the

1902
02:09:14.86 --> 02:09:18.38
argument was like I could sleep but I and I didn't really think about sleep too much

1903
02:09:18.38 --> 02:09:22.90
but I like I'd go to sleep and then just wake up like okay well I'm gonna do whatever

1904
02:09:22.90 --> 02:09:28.50
yeah I mean there's several genes that I wouldn't be surprised if you have some of them I'm

1905
02:09:28.50 --> 02:09:34.98
a guy who can get away without much sleep as well it's not as true now it's not true

1906
02:09:34.98 --> 02:09:40.30
now like the older you get the harder it is but my freaking old neighbor Vietnam dude

1907
02:09:40.30 --> 02:09:46.02
this this dude like I'd wake up in the morning he'd be sitting out on this porch yeah he's

1908
02:09:46.02 --> 02:09:49.02
like yeah I don't sleep I don't need to sleep I'm watching the neighborhood he'd tell me

1909
02:09:49.02 --> 02:09:55.46
I'd be like right oh man yeah yeah I mean it it's there's there's variation like when

1910
02:09:55.46 --> 02:10:00.26
I was in I mean obviously the whole time I was in college and the whole time I was in

1911
02:10:00.26 --> 02:10:04.50
medical school like I had a married and have kids you know like I'm coming over medical

1912
02:10:04.50 --> 02:10:10.18
school like making dinner for my kids you know giving them baths reading them to sleep

1913
02:10:10.18 --> 02:10:19.78
deprivation like it and I sleep in five hours a night on a good night for ten years now though

1914
02:10:19.78 --> 02:10:25.22
part of its age but part of its and it wasn't until I figured this out for the team guys

1915
02:10:25.22 --> 02:10:28.90
that I said well maybe I should apply this shit to myself right so I started sleeping

1916
02:10:28.90 --> 02:10:36.18
more and now I now I'm really bad at functioning without sleep like I got used to it and I

1917
02:10:36.18 --> 02:10:42.10
think you kind of the thing about sleep like one of the things it makes then obviously

1918
02:10:42.10 --> 02:10:47.18
I don't just do sleep but sleep to big component of what I do just because it's the most important

1919
02:10:47.18 --> 02:10:54.46
factor of your health if I do my job well first of all the sales pitch sucks because

1920
02:10:54.46 --> 02:10:59.82
what sleep good for everything what's the worst thing you can say in marketing like

1921
02:10:59.82 --> 02:11:04.46
it fixes anything like every you're better at everything when you sleep well you're smarter

1922
02:11:04.46 --> 02:11:09.26
you're faster stronger smarter you're better looking like everything everything's better

1923
02:11:09.26 --> 02:11:13.90
lower stress hormones higher anabolic hormones better appetite regulation everything's better

1924
02:11:13.90 --> 02:11:19.02
when you sleep and so that's a terrible sales pitch now the other thing is like if I do

1925
02:11:19.02 --> 02:11:25.90
my job really well and you sleep amazingly well you won't remember it at all and like

1926
02:11:25.90 --> 02:11:30.06
no trust me it was great for you and like you know now at least you have wearables

1927
02:11:30.06 --> 02:11:33.70
and you have people tracking their sleep and something like there's some you know there's

1928
02:11:33.70 --> 02:11:38.86
something to make it a little easier for me and that and that respect but like there's

1929
02:11:38.86 --> 02:11:43.10
I mean there's no question that's the most important aspect of your life and the big

1930
02:11:43.10 --> 02:11:47.98
problem the other big problem of sleep is that when you so like the whole point of me

1931
02:11:47.98 --> 02:11:53.34
going to sleep tonight is to repair everything that I did to myself today right everything

1932
02:11:53.34 --> 02:11:58.06
that every fuel source I exhausted that needs to be replenished or any damage I've done

1933
02:11:58.06 --> 02:12:04.46
that needs to be fixed and then I need to you store things and organize things and set

1934
02:12:04.46 --> 02:12:11.26
hormone regulation for tomorrow so I'm repairing from today and preparing for tomorrow well

1935
02:12:11.26 --> 02:12:16.10
it takes eight hours to recover from sixteen hours vast majority of the time let's say

1936
02:12:16.10 --> 02:12:19.54
ninety five percent of people in the planet that way ninety eight percent of people maybe

1937
02:12:19.54 --> 02:12:26.10
that way if I only sleep six hours instead of eight hours tomorrow still comes right

1938
02:12:26.10 --> 02:12:31.14
if I didn't repair and prepare a hundred percent how do I do tomorrow right where am I going

1939
02:12:31.14 --> 02:12:34.54
to get the energy from well I'm going to get that from stress hormones that's going to

1940
02:12:34.54 --> 02:12:39.26
increase and stress hormones are catabolic if you think about it if I went to sleep and

1941
02:12:39.26 --> 02:12:43.74
I could repair a hundred percent and prepare a hundred percent for tomorrow I would never

1942
02:12:43.74 --> 02:12:49.18
age right I'd be exactly the same every day I'd wake up exactly the same every day there

1943
02:12:49.18 --> 02:12:56.90
would be no aging involved the fact that I can't the reason I age if I decide to cut

1944
02:12:56.90 --> 02:13:01.66
away twenty five percent of my sleep on purpose I'm choosing age twenty five percent faster

1945
02:13:01.66 --> 02:13:06.06
if I'm somebody who's capable of sleeping eight hours right and like you said like not

1946
02:13:06.06 --> 02:13:11.18
everybody is and some of that's learned some of that's yeah I'm going to be like habitually

1947
02:13:11.18 --> 02:13:19.14
right and like I had a eighty well she's in her late seventies at the time a client like

1948
02:13:19.14 --> 02:13:25.06
probably ten years ago and she's like I haven't slept more than four hours and twenty years

1949
02:13:25.06 --> 02:13:33.06
and I was like that's not good for you so I get her like just sleep hygiene just my sleep

1950
02:13:33.06 --> 02:13:38.82
supplement no drugs no hormones like just like nutritional supplements and sleep hygiene

1951
02:13:38.82 --> 02:13:44.14
ritual around sleep start sleeping eight hours and like as far as I know she still is you

1952
02:13:44.14 --> 02:13:47.14
know I haven't talked to in a few years but she feel better she just feel like she's wasting

1953
02:13:47.14 --> 02:13:54.22
one quarter of her day so so so here here this is true about everything I do so everything

1954
02:13:54.22 --> 02:13:58.46
performance based so I get people to sleep I get people to eat right get people to exercise

1955
02:13:58.46 --> 02:14:02.66
right and get people to control their stress get their hormones in order I get their inflammation

1956
02:14:02.66 --> 02:14:09.02
down with peptides whatever and they come to me like oh my god I didn't realize how

1957
02:14:09.02 --> 02:14:14.90
bad I was until I felt good and that's like a month into her and then another month later

1958
02:14:14.90 --> 02:14:19.74
oh no no now I feel like I used to feel like now and then three it takes like three or

1959
02:14:19.74 --> 02:14:25.38
four months of like really good behavior to realize how much you've lost because our

1960
02:14:25.38 --> 02:14:29.90
awareness like I said our awareness of sleep isn't there that's the whole idea of it right

1961
02:14:29.90 --> 02:14:35.94
we're not paying attention to that but our self-awareness of how impaired we are just

1962
02:14:35.94 --> 02:14:40.58
like a drunk person the research has been done over and over again I deprive you of

1963
02:14:40.58 --> 02:14:45.58
this much sleep I give you this many alcohol drinks your blood alcohol level is this you

1964
02:14:45.58 --> 02:14:51.38
haven't slept this much same thing like correlates exactly I just like that's so hard for me to

1965
02:14:51.38 --> 02:14:57.22
understand because plateau I like that here's an example of this so we do an event at echelon

1966
02:14:57.22 --> 02:15:03.94
front called the muster and it's a big event and when we first started doing it I'll talk

1967
02:15:03.94 --> 02:15:09.94
about the second one that we did was in New York City it's you know there's 900 people

1968
02:15:09.94 --> 02:15:15.78
coming there's all this stuff to get done there's and so long story short we we behind

1969
02:15:15.78 --> 02:15:19.14
the scenes we weren't as squared away as we should have been so we had a bunch of stuff

1970
02:15:19.14 --> 02:15:23.74
to do preparing these big briefs these slides get ready and we had to do all this stuff

1971
02:15:23.74 --> 02:15:30.62
and so life who's doing it with me I think it was like 130 in the morning and we're

1972
02:15:30.62 --> 02:15:38.42
the events the next day it's 130 in the morning we're signing 900 certificates of graduation

1973
02:15:38.42 --> 02:15:44.06
we're gonna wake up at 330 to go do PT so we're on stage I mean I'm on stage with two

1974
02:15:44.06 --> 02:15:48.50
hours of sleep yeah and I'm answering questions I'm giving presentations and that day is like

1975
02:15:48.50 --> 02:15:54.70
starts it we get up at 330 we PT we go 430 the group comes in PT's we go get up on stage

1976
02:15:54.70 --> 02:15:58.14
we do all day same thing the next day the next day we got other stuff we got to do we

1977
02:15:58.14 --> 02:16:03.66
get no sleep and like and bro I mean we're we're on operations we used to like going

1978
02:16:03.66 --> 02:16:08.70
on an operation especially in Ramadi you're planning you're planning planning planning

1979
02:16:08.70 --> 02:16:13.90
right and I'm saying especially in Ramadi for me because we would plan with the army

1980
02:16:13.90 --> 02:16:16.98
we got to go check in with Iraq he's got all the stuff going on by the time we go in the

1981
02:16:16.98 --> 02:16:21.38
field we haven't slept right I remember being so happy to go in the field because I can

1982
02:16:21.38 --> 02:16:26.58
finally sleep yeah like three hours yeah under under a bush on rocks and cactus yeah and

1983
02:16:26.58 --> 02:16:33.30
so I never and look I mean I've been drunk before right and I wouldn't want to I wouldn't

1984
02:16:33.30 --> 02:16:39.90
trust myself to get up on stage right and and you know if I had if I had I think I could

1985
02:16:39.90 --> 02:16:46.62
probably have four drinks and still like present at the muster it'd be a little bit

1986
02:16:46.62 --> 02:16:51.50
extra yeah but if you got me to like six drinks it'd be a different event right and it wouldn't

1987
02:16:51.50 --> 02:16:58.74
be good a little bit so that's a kind of an exaggeration acutely you can compensate right

1988
02:16:58.74 --> 02:17:06.14
so if you think about it so you know you have the autonomic nervous system right you have

1989
02:17:06.14 --> 02:17:10.94
the parasympathetic and sympathetic and in the maximal sympathetic output we call fire

1990
02:17:10.94 --> 02:17:17.42
flight right so when you get up into fight or flight what happens you become superhuman

1991
02:17:17.42 --> 02:17:23.22
right your pupils dilate start taking a bigger field of vision right your lungs expand you

1992
02:17:23.22 --> 02:17:28.50
start taking the more oxygen your blood pressure goes up your peripheral perfusion goes down

1993
02:17:28.50 --> 02:17:32.02
so if you get caught you don't bleed to death you know your reflexes get faster you release

1994
02:17:32.02 --> 02:17:35.94
a bunch of glucose you have more endurance more strength faster reflexes like you're

1995
02:17:35.94 --> 02:17:41.66
superhuman you feel you don't feel amazing because you're scared right but you feel alive

1996
02:17:41.66 --> 02:17:46.58
and ready right and you're like you can react to everything faster why don't you run around

1997
02:17:46.58 --> 02:17:51.26
like that all the time because it's catabolic you're using yourself as the fuel source to

1998
02:17:51.26 --> 02:17:54.38
get away from the danger because it doesn't matter so that's what I do in those events

1999
02:17:54.38 --> 02:17:57.46
yeah so it doesn't matter if you can digest your food it doesn't matter if you can fight

2000
02:17:57.46 --> 02:18:02.02
off infection doesn't matter because like you need to get away from this threat yeah before

2001
02:18:02.02 --> 02:18:06.22
any of that matter so you're gonna marshal a hundred percent of your resources and touch

2002
02:18:06.22 --> 02:18:09.90
that so that's what you're doing you're digging into the well or whatever yeah you're digging

2003
02:18:09.90 --> 02:18:14.62
in now if you recover from that yeah and believe me like not a big deal like we have gone through

2004
02:18:14.62 --> 02:18:19.66
great lengths like now at the muster it's everything is just so well oiled I mean we're

2005
02:18:19.66 --> 02:18:24.66
going to bed at like you know nine o'clock and we joke about like all right 8 30 I'm

2006
02:18:24.66 --> 02:18:30.18
getting ready to go to bed like we we love that you know it's this this this is to support

2007
02:18:30.18 --> 02:18:37.10
what you're talking about I know this a hundred percent if I don't get actually when I'm going

2008
02:18:37.10 --> 02:18:45.22
to an event like if I'm gonna speak I sleep a little bit less because it makes me more

2009
02:18:45.22 --> 02:18:51.38
and she's engaged with what's happening even more emotional like right I will be more emotionally

2010
02:18:51.38 --> 02:18:57.34
engaged if I'm super well rested I'm just kind of like cool like yeah everything's good

2011
02:18:57.34 --> 02:19:02.58
and and I'll tell you another thing that well you already mentioned it like when I'm if I'm

2012
02:19:02.58 --> 02:19:07.70
eating like crap yeah bro my sleep it's a desire I feel like crap right but the sleep is crap

2013
02:19:07.70 --> 02:19:15.10
and that's a disaster the other thing is when you talk about stress I mean I don't stress

2014
02:19:15.10 --> 02:19:20.10
about a lot like even like and I think it's getting you know you get used to in the teams

2015
02:19:20.10 --> 02:19:23.42
like what what you know I wrote about in this book like what you got to know what to worry

2016
02:19:23.42 --> 02:19:28.78
about what's important what's not important and for me the list of things that are important

2017
02:19:28.78 --> 02:19:33.70
is this list that has like four things on it is like is your fam is my family healthy

2018
02:19:33.70 --> 02:19:38.58
right right like okay like that's something else but hey they're healthy so I'm not stressed

2019
02:19:38.58 --> 02:19:43.94
about that I can't like there's nothing else in the stress box that I'm really like because

2020
02:19:43.94 --> 02:19:49.62
if you know what's going on oh I brought this product is coming out okay well what if the

2021
02:19:49.62 --> 02:19:54.98
product fails okay then we'll do something yeah like so I think I'm pretty good with

2022
02:19:54.98 --> 02:20:01.98
the keeping myself out of the stress zone eating good when I eat like crap I feel like

2023
02:20:01.98 --> 02:20:07.98
crap look and pizza's a you know you gotta look at some pizza whoever invented that like

2024
02:20:07.98 --> 02:20:12.86
what an evil bastard and chocolate chip cookies on the new york so like you get that but I'm

2025
02:20:12.86 --> 02:20:19.66
lucky I don't like pizza I didn't like it until I was like damn but like my wife man she made

2026
02:20:19.66 --> 02:20:24.98
this she my wife's the best prime rub prime rib in the world like it's the world-class

2027
02:20:24.98 --> 02:20:31.02
prime rib and somehow she triple ordered or something over Thanksgiving because we eat

2028
02:20:31.02 --> 02:20:34.02
prime rib for Thanksgiving but she we thought we're having people people didn't show up

2029
02:20:34.02 --> 02:20:39.86
all the loss we had just massive hunks of prime rib yeah and probably I did like almost

2030
02:20:39.86 --> 02:20:44.34
a carnivore thing yeah we're like four or five days and then and then she cooked another

2031
02:20:44.34 --> 02:20:50.74
one and man I felt so good bro just eating like one big slab of prime rib a day yeah

2032
02:20:50.74 --> 02:20:59.26
and I just was like mm-hmm so good diet and then the sleep works out and the and so so

2033
02:20:59.26 --> 02:21:05.06
everything matters right everything matters you you and I are very similar in that I don't

2034
02:21:05.06 --> 02:21:08.82
stress or anything either and by and large I think it's because I don't really remember

2035
02:21:08.82 --> 02:21:13.02
I don't remember all the stuff I have to do if I remember if I could remember all of it

2036
02:21:13.02 --> 02:21:17.30
I'd be I might be stressed but you know stress women's get a bad rap because everything so

2037
02:21:17.30 --> 02:21:22.46
that is negative it's not negative right with no stress woman you die right stress

2038
02:21:22.46 --> 02:21:26.14
women's keep you alert in proportion to your environment so if you're doing something that's

2039
02:21:26.14 --> 02:21:29.46
really intense you want to be able to stress right you want stress hormones because that's

2040
02:21:29.46 --> 02:21:34.26
kind of adrenaline nor adrenaline and that's amping you up making you feel good that quarters

2041
02:21:34.26 --> 02:21:39.34
all is helping us releasing blood glucose and stuff like it stored glycogen into blood

2042
02:21:39.34 --> 02:21:43.66
glucose so it's making you feel better it's making you sharper right like there's some

2043
02:21:43.66 --> 02:21:46.94
things that's making you sharper now it does impair the prefrontal cortex a bit which is

2044
02:21:46.94 --> 02:21:52.18
like your executive functioning here yeah so you don't want them to be too high because

2045
02:21:52.18 --> 02:21:55.70
like you think about you know if you're in a fist fight can you remember your phone number

2046
02:21:55.70 --> 02:21:59.14
like probably not right because like your prefrontal cortex that ain't working like you're not

2047
02:21:59.14 --> 02:22:04.82
going to be planning your next trip or something while you're while you're in something stressful

2048
02:22:04.82 --> 02:22:13.70
so that you know that's one factor now another factor is if you sleep really well and if

2049
02:22:13.70 --> 02:22:20.06
you don't stress a lot during the day even if you short sleep it's it's not as big of

2050
02:22:20.06 --> 02:22:24.74
a deal right because the quality of sleep is keeping your stress hormones lower like the

2051
02:22:24.74 --> 02:22:29.58
lowest your stress hormones ever are when you're in deep sleep and of course they peak

2052
02:22:29.58 --> 02:22:34.98
somewhere in the afternoon like I've heard 11 to 1 1 to 3 like I it seems to be somewhere

2053
02:22:34.98 --> 02:22:42.02
on noon to 1 in most of the people I test you know that as you know it as that peak goes

2054
02:22:42.02 --> 02:22:45.10
up people are feeling more and more alert their body temperature is going up there's

2055
02:22:45.10 --> 02:22:49.38
all sorts of like good physiological things going on but people feel better under more

2056
02:22:49.38 --> 02:22:55.58
stress hormones and you can go excessive and it becomes it becomes negative but just the

2057
02:22:55.58 --> 02:22:59.94
fact that you're not somebody who stresses a lot like one of the one of the biggest things

2058
02:22:59.94 --> 02:23:08.42
I do and and I can I can put out a link for your if anyone in your audience wants to check

2059
02:23:08.42 --> 02:23:15.02
this out it's like a it's a PDF on my website but I can like do a lander for we'll do duck

2060
02:23:15.02 --> 02:23:19.98
parsley.com yeah.

2061
02:23:19.98 --> 02:23:24.38
Or something like Wynton would but people can download this the most and the most powerful

2062
02:23:24.38 --> 02:23:28.74
thing I do is seems ridiculous have people take a piece of notebook paper and like draw

2063
02:23:28.74 --> 02:23:33.22
a line straight down the middle it's like on the left side you're right to do on the

2064
02:23:33.22 --> 02:23:38.66
right side it's to worry so to do list as far out as you're likely to worry about really

2065
02:23:38.66 --> 02:23:43.14
like me I I'm kind of I never really got out of but some kind of like one evolution at

2066
02:23:43.14 --> 02:23:47.62
a time like maybe I'll plan two or three days ahead like I don't I'm not I'm not somebody's

2067
02:23:47.62 --> 02:23:50.46
going to be worried about something in months down the road but some people are so as far

2068
02:23:50.46 --> 02:23:55.18
out as you're to do to worry is shit you don't have any control over but you know you're

2069
02:23:55.18 --> 02:23:58.22
going to worry about it you don't want to forget to have the opportunity to worry about

2070
02:23:58.22 --> 02:24:02.86
so you put that on the list and then you know there's some other stuff about setting alarms

2071
02:24:02.86 --> 02:24:08.42
and getting ready and all this stuff but the big thing is when when you go to sleep you

2072
02:24:08.42 --> 02:24:12.38
realize like to first I have to convince you of this you have to convince yourself this

2073
02:24:12.38 --> 02:24:19.82
that the best you're ever going to be at handling that list is after you slept well right your

2074
02:24:19.82 --> 02:24:24.58
exercise is good your nutrition is good controlling your daily stress the best you're ever going

2075
02:24:24.58 --> 02:24:30.46
to be is after you fully wake up right to maybe an hour after you wake up after a good

2076
02:24:30.46 --> 02:24:35.22
night sleep so there's no sense in thinking about anything on that list while you're asleep

2077
02:24:35.22 --> 02:24:39.18
right because you're interfering with your goal of being the best you tomorrow so now

2078
02:24:39.18 --> 02:24:42.66
from the time you go to bed till the time that alarm clock goes off in the morning you

2079
02:24:42.66 --> 02:24:46.38
don't ever know what time it is because it doesn't matter and you're going to lay in

2080
02:24:46.38 --> 02:24:49.98
bed and you're going to like meditate and breathe and relax if you're not asleep and

2081
02:24:49.98 --> 02:24:53.22
then you're going to sleep when you sleep and if you wake up you just lay there and meditate

2082
02:24:53.22 --> 02:24:56.54
breathe and relax or like whatever if your alarm is not going to go up for four hours

2083
02:24:56.54 --> 02:25:00.70
you'll fall back asleep if your alarm goes off 30 minutes later all right you got seven

2084
02:25:00.70 --> 02:25:06.78
and a half hours of sleep and 30 minutes of meditation get after it go right so you kind

2085
02:25:06.78 --> 02:25:12.86
of have that built in naturally and and I think a lot of team guys do because you you

2086
02:25:12.86 --> 02:25:17.30
go through some really stressful shit relative to like you get out in the entrepreneur world

2087
02:25:17.30 --> 02:25:22.34
is like that's kind of stressful but like if I fail I can just start something else

2088
02:25:22.34 --> 02:25:26.34
like something collapses like it's not really that I mean I'm not getting shot at I'm not

2089
02:25:26.34 --> 02:25:35.86
cold and not wet you know it's just a different scene so I think that's that's why you're

2090
02:25:35.86 --> 02:25:40.94
experiencing which experience now the other thing to remember those like if somebody

2091
02:25:40.94 --> 02:25:46.42
goes out for a drink right they meet their buddy at a bar like yeah you know I'm going

2092
02:25:46.42 --> 02:25:51.38
to stop by chat for a little bit and take off so I'm just going to have one drink because

2093
02:25:51.38 --> 02:25:57.30
I want to drive drunk right I want to be impaired and then somehow they end up having to maybe

2094
02:25:57.30 --> 02:26:01.94
I'll have another and then by like the fourth drinks I'm fine I can I can drive home like

2095
02:26:01.94 --> 02:26:06.54
where did that decision making shift at some point you lost awareness of your impairment

2096
02:26:06.54 --> 02:26:11.42
you became more impaired and you lost your ability to recognize that you're impaired

2097
02:26:11.42 --> 02:26:16.34
sleep deprivation is the same way so you wake up and you're just like I feel good because

2098
02:26:16.34 --> 02:26:20.14
the stress woman's making you feel good right you're impaired though like we just know like

2099
02:26:20.14 --> 02:26:25.78
it's unavoidable it's just like putting alcohol on your blood putting you know putting stress

2100
02:26:25.78 --> 02:26:32.46
woman's in your brain make your prefrontal cortex not as active now there's a there's

2101
02:26:32.46 --> 02:26:37.26
a there's a little bump where it's actually better right because you're adrenalized you

2102
02:26:37.26 --> 02:26:41.42
can't do everything better but there's some advantages to certain aspects to certain behaviors

2103
02:26:41.42 --> 02:26:45.62
but then it goes too high and it's like it's really impaired right like you think about

2104
02:26:45.62 --> 02:26:50.42
somebody who's super anxious are they good at anything yeah it's a bummer no they can't

2105
02:26:50.42 --> 02:26:53.66
be good at anything because their prefrontal cortex is impaired that's what that's what

2106
02:26:53.66 --> 02:26:58.26
anxiety really is you don't trust yourself you don't trust yourself to make a decision

2107
02:26:58.26 --> 02:27:05.10
because you know you have a bad track of making good decisions or something and so you don't

2108
02:27:05.10 --> 02:27:09.34
trust your ability to do it and now that's stressed you out even more and so it can be

2109
02:27:09.34 --> 02:27:15.34
a really a death spiral for a lot of people because like I said if you don't get enough

2110
02:27:15.34 --> 02:27:21.22
sleep then you wake up the next day with more stress hormones well the absence of stress

2111
02:27:21.22 --> 02:27:25.50
hormones is what allows you to fall asleep so if you're running around with 20% more

2112
02:27:25.50 --> 02:27:29.98
stress hormones than you need now when you try to go to sleep you're 20% higher than

2113
02:27:29.98 --> 02:27:34.54
you should be and it might not be low enough to fall asleep and the other thing is your

2114
02:27:34.54 --> 02:27:37.62
stress hormones are what's waking you up in the morning and cortisol is waking you up

2115
02:27:37.62 --> 02:27:43.18
so if you're running 20% higher than you should be running then you're sort of your genetic

2116
02:27:43.18 --> 02:27:50.62
background would have you running at well now you're going to wake up when you hit that

2117
02:27:50.62 --> 02:27:55.90
same level that you maybe would have hit an hour later if you didn't have the sex stress

2118
02:27:55.90 --> 02:27:56.90
hormones.

2119
02:27:56.90 --> 02:28:02.90
Let's talk sleep protocol for optimal sleep protocol.

2120
02:28:02.90 --> 02:28:12.90
So like I was talking about earlier you just think about think about humans 200 years ago

2121
02:28:12.90 --> 02:28:22.42
right or maybe go back say a thousand years hunter gatherers right we don't see well at

2122
02:28:22.42 --> 02:28:27.82
night we're crappy predators anyways right without weapons we're useless right we can't

2123
02:28:27.82 --> 02:28:36.74
fight a raccoon right we're so we don't see well at night the sun goes down the blue light

2124
02:28:36.74 --> 02:28:40.74
leaves our eyes we have nerves in our eyes that sense blue light they have nothing to

2125
02:28:40.74 --> 02:28:45.90
with vision and then that triggers the changes in our brain which leads to the melatonin

2126
02:28:45.90 --> 02:28:51.30
being secreted in the melatonin then changes a lot of things but one of the big things

2127
02:28:51.30 --> 02:28:57.14
happens increases the snare peptide GABA which slows down our brain we quit interacting

2128
02:28:57.14 --> 02:29:02.42
with the world as much and our body temperature goes down because the sun went down right

2129
02:29:02.42 --> 02:29:07.42
so it's dark we can't see we back up into a corner to be safe because we're prey a

2130
02:29:07.42 --> 02:29:11.78
thousand years ago like maybe we get in a cave whatever we make a fire now you really

2131
02:29:11.78 --> 02:29:16.70
can't see right can't see past the fire so your world gets secluded you're not interacting

2132
02:29:16.70 --> 02:29:21.02
you're not jumping around you're not climbing out lifting you're not right maybe telling

2133
02:29:21.02 --> 02:29:26.14
some stories whatever and then about three hours after the sun goes down you feel like

2134
02:29:26.14 --> 02:29:30.18
sleeping and you lay down and you sleep your body temperature keeps going down your stress

2135
02:29:30.18 --> 02:29:35.42
hormones keep going down some point all that you know starts coming back up your body temperature

2136
02:29:35.42 --> 02:29:40.26
kind of hits a maximum low and then it starts it kind of fires a survival response and you

2137
02:29:40.26 --> 02:29:44.58
start building things back up and your cortisol comes back up and you wake up right around

2138
02:29:44.58 --> 02:29:48.90
the time the sun's coming up you don't wake up because of the sun you just coincidental

2139
02:29:48.90 --> 02:29:54.58
right like because that's how you're wired like every and every mammal on this planet

2140
02:29:54.58 --> 02:29:59.62
uses the sun as it's queues want to be awake and want to be asleep so that's how our ancestors

2141
02:29:59.62 --> 02:30:04.22
did it the closest you can get to that right that's what sleep hygiene is right everything

2142
02:30:04.22 --> 02:30:09.30
you read about sleep hygiene is that right so blacking out your windows yeah because

2143
02:30:09.30 --> 02:30:13.22
you don't one you don't want the light to you don't want to know what time it is when

2144
02:30:13.22 --> 02:30:21.06
you wake up right turning down the temperature your house taking a shower taking a cold shower

2145
02:30:21.06 --> 02:30:26.50
like you want to think about what do you do as a little kid right you have a three four

2146
02:30:26.50 --> 02:30:31.18
year old kid bashing trucks together banging drums whatever you don't just throw that kid

2147
02:30:31.18 --> 02:30:35.66
in a bed and turn the light on walk out they need a ritual they need time to get ready

2148
02:30:35.66 --> 02:30:42.58
to go to sleep we study hunter gatherers today makes it's like 30,000 people who've never

2149
02:30:42.58 --> 02:30:46.70
experienced electricity never experienced electricity they still live like our ancestors

2150
02:30:46.70 --> 02:30:50.58
live they go out they hunt food hunting gather food for two hours a day the rest of the day

2151
02:30:50.58 --> 02:30:55.06
they're fucking off having sex playing around whatever like they're the original aristocrat

2152
02:30:55.06 --> 02:31:01.50
like that's where we would be if we stayed in that lifestyle so like you take your kid

2153
02:31:01.50 --> 02:31:05.94
and what do you do it's like it's time for quiet play right put that stuff away we're

2154
02:31:05.94 --> 02:31:11.70
gonna do puzzles or you know whatever we do something more today we're gonna kind of dim

2155
02:31:11.70 --> 02:31:16.70
the lights that stuff right and then we give them a bath why gonna lower their body temperature

2156
02:31:16.70 --> 02:31:20.34
right because you're not gonna give them a 98 degree bath give them like an 80 degree

2157
02:31:20.34 --> 02:31:24.14
bath 85 degree bath then they get out and you powder them up and you put them in really

2158
02:31:24.14 --> 02:31:29.90
soft clothes right okay you're not stimulating their skin and then you put them in bed you

2159
02:31:29.90 --> 02:31:33.50
know make everything soft and comfortable and warm and cozy and then you read them a

2160
02:31:33.50 --> 02:31:39.10
book that they already know right they can think about something like Dr. Seuss like

2161
02:31:39.10 --> 02:31:48.86
trans inducing rhythmic rhyming like this yeah I do not like right and so the kids already

2162
02:31:48.86 --> 02:31:52.30
know what the story and that's why they want to read that book it's like they want to be

2163
02:31:52.30 --> 02:31:58.46
settled down you want to distract yourself so you can overcome any of that right you

2164
02:31:58.46 --> 02:32:05.22
can overcome any of those systems now you're still you're still gonna secrete melatonin

2165
02:32:05.22 --> 02:32:12.86
but you can you can get past the GABA the GABA urgic slowdown of the brain right so

2166
02:32:12.86 --> 02:32:17.30
if you've ever had an experience where you're like you wake up and you're super tired you

2167
02:32:17.30 --> 02:32:21.74
didn't get enough sleep you were you're regretting whatever you did last night because you didn't

2168
02:32:21.74 --> 02:32:27.26
get enough sleep and so now you're like well man I'm just gonna go to work today I'm gonna

2169
02:32:27.26 --> 02:32:30.46
do what I have to do today and then I'm gonna come on go to bed like six o'clock and I'm

2170
02:32:30.46 --> 02:32:34.06
gonna sleep for like ten hours and feel great tomorrow and then one of your friends talked

2171
02:32:34.06 --> 02:32:38.46
in they're like gonna have a beer and then that's a CNS depression it should make you

2172
02:32:38.46 --> 02:32:44.54
more tired right and you start drinking beer and like there's attractive women around there's

2173
02:32:44.54 --> 02:32:49.34
music going there's lights so there's whatever and like you all of a sudden feel really good

2174
02:32:49.34 --> 02:32:53.66
and you don't you don't need to go to sleep anymore and like and then you stay up to midnight

2175
02:32:53.66 --> 02:32:58.42
that night now you know you're sucking again the next day so so you can you can work yourself

2176
02:32:58.42 --> 02:33:05.42
past it so just blocking the light say like whatever you wear blue blocking glasses generally

2177
02:33:05.42 --> 02:33:09.54
like you have light bulbs in your house that don't have any blue lights like all that's

2178
02:33:09.54 --> 02:33:14.14
available you're blacking everything out maybe you live in my candlelight after you know

2179
02:33:14.14 --> 02:33:18.14
whatever and you're getting spending three hours getting ready for bed but you're at

2180
02:33:18.14 --> 02:33:22.46
your computer working on some tight deadline for something for work that's stressful and

2181
02:33:22.46 --> 02:33:28.38
you're gonna work till 9.59 to go get bed at 10 no that's not gonna work so you got it

2182
02:33:28.38 --> 02:33:35.22
you got it you you have to do something to approximate the loss of light in your eyes

2183
02:33:35.22 --> 02:33:39.38
you have to do something to slow your brain down to where you're not paying as much as

2184
02:33:39.38 --> 02:33:45.02
much attention to your environment and you have to drop your body temperature that and

2185
02:33:45.02 --> 02:33:49.42
that's what it is so that that PDF I was telling you about that's really for people who have

2186
02:33:49.42 --> 02:33:56.30
problems falling asleep problems going back to sleep when they wake up and so I have those

2187
02:33:56.30 --> 02:34:01.54
people set an alarm clock like an hour before bed and this is a generally a good idea but

2188
02:34:01.54 --> 02:34:08.50
like anything else if you have problems be super like be fastidious and with this and

2189
02:34:08.50 --> 02:34:15.62
like be exact and be you know very regimented and then once you get healthy sleep back just

2190
02:34:15.62 --> 02:34:20.18
like once you get fit you don't have to do everything that you had to do to get in good

2191
02:34:20.18 --> 02:34:26.62
shape like you just generally adhere to those principles so like but when you're having problems

2192
02:34:26.62 --> 02:34:30.66
like setting an alarm clock an hour before it's time to go to bed and then you spend

2193
02:34:30.66 --> 02:34:37.30
at least that hour getting ready for bed right even if ideally you'd be dimming the lights

2194
02:34:37.30 --> 02:34:41.22
in your eyes three hours before bed but there's ideal in reality.

2195
02:34:41.22 --> 02:34:42.42
It will take an hour.

2196
02:34:42.42 --> 02:34:49.10
Yeah and so okay so do that once you get in bed you have your list right you've convinced

2197
02:34:49.10 --> 02:34:53.42
yourself that the best time to handle that list is after you get a good night's sleep

2198
02:34:53.42 --> 02:34:59.58
you get in bed you have no awareness of the time until that morning alarm clock goes off

2199
02:34:59.58 --> 02:35:05.74
whether you need an alarm clock or not right because if you don't have the alarm clock that's

2200
02:35:05.74 --> 02:35:08.14
something to worry about.

2201
02:35:08.14 --> 02:35:12.74
Here's a jockeau admission if I don't have an alarm clock and there's any like if I

2202
02:35:12.74 --> 02:35:17.10
have to be at work or yeah I have to do something and I don't have an alarm clock I literally

2203
02:35:17.10 --> 02:35:22.18
will not sleep yeah I will just sit there and like you know when I first started traveling

2204
02:35:22.18 --> 02:35:27.82
and lecturing a lot I was petrified I was gonna oversleep and like not make it to some

2205
02:35:27.82 --> 02:35:33.94
lecture so even with a couple of alarms set on my phone I kept like every every no I'm

2206
02:35:33.94 --> 02:35:40.46
like wake up my alarm go off okay so yeah right and like that's the thing so I say hey

2207
02:35:40.46 --> 02:35:43.58
you have a morning alarm clock even if you think you don't need it because that's one

2208
02:35:43.58 --> 02:35:48.26
thing you're not going to worry about so you're gonna the last time you're gonna see your clock

2209
02:35:48.26 --> 02:35:52.70
is when you get in bed and until that alarm clock goes off it doesn't matter because you've

2210
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:57.10
already made yourself the agreement that I'm gonna be resting relaxing meditating doing

2211
02:35:57.10 --> 02:36:03.10
breath work whatever or I'm gonna be sleeping for the next eight hours that's it I'm not

2212
02:36:03.10 --> 02:36:08.14
doing anything else and it's some and something on something pops in my mind I go that's on

2213
02:36:08.14 --> 02:36:12.50
the list I'm gonna handle that list in the morning when I'm feeling good right when I'm

2214
02:36:12.50 --> 02:36:16.98
prepared now if there's something that's not on the list get my permission to turn the

2215
02:36:16.98 --> 02:36:22.54
light on and write it down now it's on the list right and then you just lay in bed breathe

2216
02:36:22.54 --> 02:36:25.26
when you wake up you don't know what time it is you have to go to the bathroom go to

2217
02:36:25.26 --> 02:36:29.82
the bathroom get back in bed you don't know what time it is so I have like the little

2218
02:36:29.82 --> 02:36:37.58
LED red like clock by my bed that's that's not needed it's not needed in fact it's counterproductive

2219
02:36:37.58 --> 02:36:40.70
counterproductive because then I'm thinking about what time it is you as soon as you

2220
02:36:40.70 --> 02:36:47.02
want it as soon as you know what time it is you're you have some decisions to make now

2221
02:36:47.02 --> 02:36:52.50
right because it's like well I start doing some mental math right like well I'm not

2222
02:36:52.50 --> 02:36:57.66
feeling sleepy it's only 130 and I so if I phone if I can fall asleep the next 30 minutes

2223
02:36:57.66 --> 02:37:03.14
you start thinking about stuff like that or my alarm's gonna go off in 45 minutes anyway

2224
02:37:03.14 --> 02:37:06.62
as I'm feeling kind of awake and I got this stuff to do and I got that sound I might as

2225
02:37:06.62 --> 02:37:11.82
well just write and so it's better to just not know and go hey no I'm gonna be I want

2226
02:37:11.82 --> 02:37:16.02
to be at my best tomorrow my best is when that alarm clock goes off and like I said

2227
02:37:16.02 --> 02:37:23.86
I don't care how much meditation and breath work and relaxation you get relative to sleep

2228
02:37:23.86 --> 02:37:29.18
do your do your best to get all of that asleep but if you know an hour of that's meditation

2229
02:37:29.18 --> 02:37:33.38
and breath work and relaxation progressive muscle relaxation whatever you want to do

2230
02:37:33.38 --> 02:37:38.14
whatever kind of cools you out whatever lowers your stress hormones like I don't care it's

2231
02:37:38.14 --> 02:37:44.82
like that's restorative like that's non sleeping rest has its benefits as well and it's helping

2232
02:37:44.82 --> 02:37:51.98
with all of that stuff and as I'm sure you've heard at this point you know sleep regulate

2233
02:37:51.98 --> 02:37:58.62
your appetite right so how hungry I am tomorrow it's gonna be determined by how well I sleep

2234
02:37:58.62 --> 02:38:06.46
today also what I crave the only animal on this planet that sleep defy itself is us other

2235
02:38:06.46 --> 02:38:10.78
animals only do it if they're starving or they're being preyed upon so if they're being

2236
02:38:10.78 --> 02:38:15.30
stalked they're only gonna sleep the bare minimum if they're starving they're gonna

2237
02:38:15.30 --> 02:38:20.82
wake up earlier go to sleep later so they have can travel further and find some food

2238
02:38:20.82 --> 02:38:25.58
so evolutionarily it makes sense that we're wired the same way so if we're not sleeping

2239
02:38:25.58 --> 02:38:31.54
our brains like oh are we being stalked or are we starving which is it right and so I

2240
02:38:31.54 --> 02:38:36.26
want to eat novel foods when I'm starving so I'll eat anything right like a green and

2241
02:38:36.26 --> 02:38:41.82
brown green and orange donut yeah let's eat that right also if I'm starving what I want

2242
02:38:41.82 --> 02:38:45.62
I want sugar for my brain like right now as much glucose as my brain can get this is my

2243
02:38:45.62 --> 02:38:49.74
brain is working off of glucose right I don't have an option there ketones can do some of

2244
02:38:49.74 --> 02:38:55.30
it if you're really ketotic but it's not it's still majority glucose and if I'm starving

2245
02:38:55.30 --> 02:38:59.78
what I want to store some fat so I better eat some fat too right so what so what's

2246
02:38:59.78 --> 02:39:06.82
a donut it's fried sugar bread right and so like I get all the I get the fat and I get

2247
02:39:06.82 --> 02:39:14.46
all of the you know and I get all of the glucose in me so not only is it regulating how hungry

2248
02:39:14.46 --> 02:39:19.42
I'm gonna be but what am I going to crave and then the worst part is that it determines

2249
02:39:19.42 --> 02:39:26.78
what my body does with what I eat right so I eat proteins carbohydrates and fats some

2250
02:39:26.78 --> 02:39:30.10
of that's gonna be stored as fat some of that's not gonna be absorbed at all and it's gonna

2251
02:39:30.10 --> 02:39:35.14
go out of the way since some of that's gonna be used as energy depends on how well I've

2252
02:39:35.14 --> 02:39:41.26
slept and how my hormones are balanced and so you know one it wanted the big jokes especially

2253
02:39:41.26 --> 02:39:47.38
on men is that you know our arts the fat that we think of as being fat right not the not

2254
02:39:47.38 --> 02:39:52.26
the fat around our organs and stuff but like our subcutaneous fat that has a lot of aromatics

2255
02:39:52.26 --> 02:39:56.58
in it the enzyme that converts testosterone from estrogen in your brain uses estrogen

2256
02:39:56.58 --> 02:40:01.90
as the measurement of how much testosterone you have so if your estrogen is really high

2257
02:40:01.90 --> 02:40:06.02
your brain's like oh that's coming from testosterone so our testosterone must be really high too

2258
02:40:06.02 --> 02:40:11.66
so we don't need to make as much testosterone now and now you get more fat and more of your

2259
02:40:11.66 --> 02:40:16.14
testosterone becomes estrogen and like it's this so defeating spiral I could just keeps

2260
02:40:16.14 --> 02:40:22.16
getting worse like now you're getting fatter because your hormones are low but you're converting

2261
02:40:22.16 --> 02:40:26.24
like you have higher estrogen levels because more fat means a more inspiring and so now

2262
02:40:26.24 --> 02:40:31.84
you're know it's like it's the same thing of having high stress hormones because you're

2263
02:40:31.84 --> 02:40:35.58
not sleeping well now you can't sleep because you have high stress hormones and now you

2264
02:40:35.58 --> 02:40:39.70
know I'm not gonna get to sleep tomorrow you're gonna have even more stress and so you can't

2265
02:40:39.70 --> 02:40:44.42
sleep because you have too much stress hormones and you have too much stress hormones because

2266
02:40:44.42 --> 02:40:49.26
you can't sleep. Same thing with estrogen and like testosterone gets converted is like

2267
02:40:49.26 --> 02:40:54.02
we're not making tests as much testosterone because your estrogen levels are high, which

2268
02:40:54.02 --> 02:40:59.22
leads to higher estrogen levels, which means lower testosterone level. And that's a self,

2269
02:40:59.22 --> 02:41:07.14
you know, defeating itself propagating downward spiral. And so like all all of the all of

2270
02:41:07.14 --> 02:41:13.50
that stuff's non negotiable, right? That's that's going to happen no matter how well

2271
02:41:13.50 --> 02:41:19.82
you eat, no matter how well you control your stress and all that other stuff. So then how

2272
02:41:19.82 --> 02:41:23.62
much you exercise and the other thing I tell people all the time, which is not popular

2273
02:41:23.62 --> 02:41:31.78
at all, is that if you're sleep deprived, you shouldn't work out, right? Shouldn't

2274
02:41:31.78 --> 02:41:36.58
exercise. I mean, you should move, you should do activity because there's benefit to that.

2275
02:41:36.58 --> 02:41:40.86
But you shouldn't exercise with the intent of getting better at something, right to get

2276
02:41:40.86 --> 02:41:45.06
stronger faster more quarterly. Because like I said, like all that's happening when you're

2277
02:41:45.06 --> 02:41:49.26
asleep, all of that's all that repair and actually getting better at anything is happening

2278
02:41:49.26 --> 02:41:50.26
while you're asleep.

2279
02:41:50.26 --> 02:41:57.14
I'm just going to plead the fifth over here. Yeah, I was I was going to ask you that and

2280
02:41:57.14 --> 02:42:00.90
I was like, I pretty much know what your answer going to be because there's people that have

2281
02:42:00.90 --> 02:42:05.02
to make that decision. Like am I better off tomorrow? Okay, I know I got to be at work

2282
02:42:05.02 --> 02:42:10.30
by eight. I know it's a late night. It's one o'clock in the morning. My kid was awake

2283
02:42:10.30 --> 02:42:15.58
or whatever it's midnight. My kid was awake. Do I get up and do the do the workout? Yeah,

2284
02:42:15.58 --> 02:42:20.10
do I get an extra hour of sleep, which is better? And yours is like sleep all day. Sleep

2285
02:42:20.10 --> 02:42:22.38
is the is the answer.

2286
02:42:22.38 --> 02:42:26.78
To an extent like if sleep is going to prevent you from doing anything, any type of activity,

2287
02:42:26.78 --> 02:42:31.78
then I find a happy medium on that like go every other day or split it in half or something

2288
02:42:31.78 --> 02:42:36.98
like that. Because you need the activity. There's a lot of benefits. And by activity,

2289
02:42:36.98 --> 02:42:43.14
I mean, you know, whatever, going on a walk doing like some zone to type of cardio, doing

2290
02:42:43.14 --> 02:42:47.78
some movement, like you could do like whatever you could do like movement drills or something

2291
02:42:47.78 --> 02:42:53.66
like that. But like I wouldn't recommend rolling with somebody intensely and you know, you're

2292
02:42:53.66 --> 02:42:58.06
not doing schoolwork like actually fighting. I wouldn't do that if I'm sleep deprived. One,

2293
02:42:58.06 --> 02:43:03.34
you're way more likely to get injured as well. Like there's a there's a very, very clear

2294
02:43:03.34 --> 02:43:09.38
correlation between how many hours you sleep and your risk of injury. And it's and it's

2295
02:43:09.38 --> 02:43:16.42
it's huge. It's substantial. It's the difference. There was a study done in high school students.

2296
02:43:16.42 --> 02:43:22.70
The difference between five hours, you know, six hours of sleep and nine hours of sleep

2297
02:43:22.70 --> 02:43:27.98
was like a 300% difference. Right. So you're of getting injured getting injured. Well,

2298
02:43:27.98 --> 02:43:31.58
the dudes are spending three more hours in bed every day. Of course, they ain't getting

2299
02:43:31.58 --> 02:43:35.18
injured. Well, he's getting injured in their sport. So like while they're while they're

2300
02:43:35.18 --> 02:43:40.94
doing this work. Yeah. So we need to get our sleep. That's the so here's something that

2301
02:43:40.94 --> 02:43:46.14
it's really interesting for your guys for when you're working with fighters, right? So,

2302
02:43:46.14 --> 02:43:50.38
you know, let's say I'm a great grappler and I'm going as a striker and I want to not

2303
02:43:50.38 --> 02:43:55.58
like have a camp and I'm like, whatever, eight weeks to get improve my boxing or whatever

2304
02:43:55.58 --> 02:44:04.86
my striking. And so it so if if I wanted to teach you something and I said, that's something

2305
02:44:04.86 --> 02:44:09.30
I do. So I'm going to teach how to type with your left hand or something or play an instrument

2306
02:44:09.30 --> 02:44:13.50
or something like that. And I say, Hey, come in for an hour of training in the morning.

2307
02:44:13.50 --> 02:44:17.22
Okay. And at the end of that hour, we see where you're at. See where skill level is.

2308
02:44:17.22 --> 02:44:21.14
And then when you come back at seven o'clock tonight, I'm going to retest you. When you

2309
02:44:21.14 --> 02:44:24.78
come back at seven, you're going to be worse than your left training. If you go home and

2310
02:44:24.78 --> 02:44:28.50
you go to sleep and you come back and test, you're going to be better than your left training

2311
02:44:28.50 --> 02:44:33.50
because you're actually learning when you sleep. Interestingly, if I say, I'm going

2312
02:44:33.50 --> 02:44:37.86
to teach you something this morning, I want you to take a nap today. And then come back

2313
02:44:37.86 --> 02:44:42.06
and test at seven, you'll come back and test better than you left your training. And then

2314
02:44:42.06 --> 02:44:45.38
when you go home and go to sleep, you're going to get better again. So if somebody could

2315
02:44:45.38 --> 02:44:50.10
break their day and like have a midday nap, they could essentially get two days worth

2316
02:44:50.10 --> 02:44:54.78
of training in a day. All fighters are doing that all the time. Yeah.

2317
02:44:54.78 --> 02:44:58.90
And like fire, that's what fighters do. Yeah, like come train, go home, sleep, come train,

2318
02:44:58.90 --> 02:45:02.86
go home, sleep, go home, train, go home and sleep for the night. Yeah. That's like, and

2319
02:45:02.86 --> 02:45:09.22
that's, and that's like two days in football to write like a huge, huge skill bump during

2320
02:45:09.22 --> 02:45:14.90
those two weeks because all you're doing is sleeping and practicing. That's it. It's

2321
02:45:14.90 --> 02:45:20.22
like, it just seems like one long day. So it's just like, I don't know, Slough woke up

2322
02:45:20.22 --> 02:45:24.54
and went to practice and Slough and woke up and went to practice. Because we would like,

2323
02:45:24.54 --> 02:45:28.62
you know, because it's so damn hot where we are like, you know, 115 degrees in the summer.

2324
02:45:28.62 --> 02:45:35.46
So midday, they, you know, sent us home, go eat, fall asleep for two hours or whatever.

2325
02:45:35.46 --> 02:45:39.98
And then you go back to practice. And but like, they weren't doing it for that reason.

2326
02:45:39.98 --> 02:45:46.74
But you know, a lot of things that once, you know, once you start learning the physiology

2327
02:45:46.74 --> 02:45:51.22
of things, a lot of things become obvious, you know, it's like the sleep deprivation

2328
02:45:51.22 --> 02:45:57.14
in boot camp, the sleep deprivation like hell, we can budge. That's a strategy. Like we're,

2329
02:45:57.14 --> 02:46:00.90
one we're seeing how well you deal with it because that matters. But two, we're also

2330
02:46:00.90 --> 02:46:09.90
looking for psychiatric disease, right? Because sleep deprivation, you know, can things come

2331
02:46:09.90 --> 02:46:15.34
to the surface? Yeah, can reveal that. And we're in that age group where young men tend

2332
02:46:15.34 --> 02:46:20.74
to have their psychotic break if they're going to be schizophrenic or their bipolar, like

2333
02:46:20.74 --> 02:46:26.86
that's going to be revealed like in their teen to mid 20s kind of thing. So let's just make

2334
02:46:26.86 --> 02:46:30.84
it happen. It's also a brainwashing thing, like when they brainwash anyone that gets

2335
02:46:30.84 --> 02:46:35.98
brainwashed is sleep deprivation. Yeah, you're way more suggestible. Yeah. Because again,

2336
02:46:35.98 --> 02:46:39.62
your prefrontal cortex doesn't work and engine like you can't and you don't have it out the

2337
02:46:39.62 --> 02:46:44.42
energy to like defend your thoughts. You're fine. That sounds like a whatever.

2338
02:46:44.42 --> 02:46:49.42
The cooling. China is great. America sucks. Yes.

2339
02:46:49.42 --> 02:46:58.14
Oh, man. Awesome. What else, man? Do we get is that get us caught up to the current day

2340
02:46:58.14 --> 02:47:04.14
other than where to where do people find you? Yeah. Doc parsley.com. You got to talk parsley.com.

2341
02:47:04.14 --> 02:47:10.06
You're on Instagram. Kirk parsley. I'm on Instagram. Kirk parsley. Yeah, at Kirk parsley.

2342
02:47:10.06 --> 02:47:12.74
And you say you're back on Twitter. I think we were talking about. Yeah, you're back on

2343
02:47:12.74 --> 02:47:17.14
Twitter. Yeah, I got re in. Yeah, I got reinstated. Yeah, I got reinstated because you got shut

2344
02:47:17.14 --> 02:47:25.46
down. You got you got. Yeah, I was I was like, I was like publishing or I was like sharing,

2345
02:47:25.46 --> 02:47:30.98
you know, published research about about what COVID COVID and you got shut down mask, you

2346
02:47:30.98 --> 02:47:37.22
know, social distancing, like whatever. When my Instagram account, I started really with doing

2347
02:47:37.22 --> 02:47:41.62
a bunch of videos on code because it was such such bullshit at the beginning. I was just like,

2348
02:47:41.62 --> 02:47:46.78
oh, like everybody knows this too. It's not I'm not brilliant. It's like everybody with any kind

2349
02:47:46.78 --> 02:47:53.22
of basic biology understands that natural immunity is a thing, right? And it's better than a

2350
02:47:53.22 --> 02:47:58.34
vaccine. Everybody knows that always that's always been true. We acted like it didn't even exist.

2351
02:47:58.34 --> 02:48:03.70
So like I'm pointing that out, you know, CNN has their death tracker rolling at the bottom of

2352
02:48:03.70 --> 02:48:08.54
the screen every day. I'm like, if you did that with car wrecks, no one would drive cars either,

2353
02:48:08.54 --> 02:48:13.34
right? Because it's like, and they never give the denominator like this many people died today.

2354
02:48:13.34 --> 02:48:22.22
How many people usually die? Right? Oh, so it's 20 more. Right. Right. So you. So I like, I spoke

2355
02:48:22.22 --> 02:48:29.50
out a bunch against it. Surprisingly, I didn't get banned by Instagram. But Twitter, I was just

2356
02:48:29.50 --> 02:48:35.50
sharing some I'd like share research and be like, you know, this suggests that that doesn't work

2357
02:48:35.50 --> 02:48:43.58
or this suggests that we're missing that right. And just one day, nobody said anything, never got

2358
02:48:43.58 --> 02:48:48.94
an email. Just one day, I just wasn't there. And then I was like, huh, couldn't get on. It says you,

2359
02:48:48.94 --> 02:48:55.34
you know, you've been banned or blocked whatever the phrasing was. And then and I had about $10,000

2360
02:48:55.34 --> 02:49:01.06
or something. And then all of a sudden they're gone, like, zero, zero, zero. But all my posts were

2361
02:49:01.06 --> 02:49:06.22
still there. And I couldn't access that many of my posts, I couldn't do anything with them. And

2362
02:49:06.22 --> 02:49:14.42
then it was after the announcement that that Elon was going to buy Twitter. But just before he

2363
02:49:14.42 --> 02:49:22.82
actually bought it. And I just reappeared all of a sudden, just reappeared. I got it. I got an

2364
02:49:22.82 --> 02:49:33.42
email that time. It's like, you've been reinstated. And you can get your seat formula at docparsley.com.

2365
02:49:33.42 --> 02:49:39.14
If you want to order that. Yeah, we're going to do docparsley.com. Chaka though. Okay. Yeah,

2366
02:49:39.14 --> 02:49:47.30
go for your audiences. And we'll put that worksheet on there. So anybody who digs this stuff.

2367
02:49:47.30 --> 02:49:53.06
What else? Echo, you got any questions? Yeah, couple. So the, by the way, Echo is in full

2368
02:49:53.06 --> 02:49:59.46
support of everything you say, like, rest is at the top of his list for life. I'm telling you,

2369
02:49:59.46 --> 02:50:04.62
right, you can't just, he's, he's Hawaiian though, right? Yeah. And why there's a very good,

2370
02:50:04.62 --> 02:50:13.90
robust rest culture. So, um, okay, so the down regulating of receptors, is that kind of the

2371
02:50:13.90 --> 02:50:21.10
whole explanation for tolerance of any drug? Like, you know, yeah, that, so the technical

2372
02:50:21.10 --> 02:50:24.98
phrase for that is it's tacky fill access. Yeah. And that's not really what that means,

2373
02:50:24.98 --> 02:50:28.86
essentially, there's, there's some nuance to that, but that's an easy way to think about it. It's

2374
02:50:28.86 --> 02:50:35.98
just, um, it doesn't matter. Yeah, it doesn't matter what's in your blood, if it doesn't have a

2375
02:50:35.98 --> 02:50:40.14
receptor, right? So you have, you have to have a place to catch it. Both of those things are,

2376
02:50:40.14 --> 02:50:44.78
you could say, think of it like a lock and a key, right? So like the, the keys, maybe what's floating

2377
02:50:44.78 --> 02:50:49.82
around in your bloodstream, but then the lock is locked, it fits that key is the receptor. And so

2378
02:50:49.82 --> 02:50:53.74
if you don't have the receptors, it doesn't matter how many keys are floating around. Yeah. And then

2379
02:50:53.74 --> 02:50:58.70
different receptors can bind to like different stuff, right? Like, you know, Holly, you said, and you

2380
02:50:58.70 --> 02:51:03.34
mentioned that I forget all the names, but you know, a receptor made for a very specific thing,

2381
02:51:03.34 --> 02:51:07.58
can a drug can be developed to be like, Hey, it can bind to that receptor. And that's how

2382
02:51:07.58 --> 02:51:14.62
most pharmacology is. So most pharmacology, well, you know, most, most medicine, most biology is

2383
02:51:14.62 --> 02:51:19.34
just, it's really just descriptive, right? And we figure out a way to look to see something

2384
02:51:19.34 --> 02:51:22.94
or to measure something. And then we go, Oh, this happens. And then that happens. And then we

2385
02:51:22.94 --> 02:51:27.90
memorize the steps as though we now know something. Like, all you did is like put names to shit that

2386
02:51:27.90 --> 02:51:33.18
was happening and memorize it. Like you, you're not it. But then they'll fit. Well, okay, so this

2387
02:51:33.18 --> 02:51:40.70
molecule, we know when this molecule binds that it does this. So we can like cut that out, if that's

2388
02:51:40.70 --> 02:51:46.14
a problem, or we can add some looking, we can have something bind that receptor that will do nothing.

2389
02:51:46.70 --> 02:51:51.82
Or we can have something bind that receptor that does better than whatever is going to bind it,

2390
02:51:51.82 --> 02:51:56.30
right? And so that's, that's really what pharmacology is mainly about other than antibiotics,

2391
02:51:56.30 --> 02:52:01.02
which is a different category. But most, most drugs that have some effect on your physiology,

2392
02:52:01.02 --> 02:52:07.42
that's how they're doing it. And then is catching up on sleep, a thing? Yeah. So

2393
02:52:08.70 --> 02:52:13.98
there's, you got some sleep, you gotta catch up on that. Well, no, no, well, it actually, at first,

2394
02:52:13.98 --> 02:52:17.90
I was like, I heard that it is, and I heard that it isn't. And then, but then you get, so we're

2395
02:52:17.90 --> 02:52:21.98
talking about like, Hey, don't work out when you're sleep deprived. But bro, I'll work out sleep

2396
02:52:21.98 --> 02:52:26.22
deprived sometimes have a great workout. Yeah. You asked me to do that the next day, bro, I'm dead.

2397
02:52:26.22 --> 02:52:31.26
So I'll never do it. So like, I feel like I use, I went into the bank a little bit,

2398
02:52:31.26 --> 02:52:37.26
use some stress hormones, banged out a solid workout, you know, caught up on some sleep,

2399
02:52:37.26 --> 02:52:42.38
did my full recovery and I'm, and I'm good to go. Yeah. No, it was your original.

2400
02:52:42.38 --> 02:52:47.18
Is like catching up on that. Is that a thing or am I kind of at a bigger loss because of that?

2401
02:52:47.18 --> 02:52:54.30
So what, so what I, what I say about it is, like, like the reason, the reason that it takes eight

2402
02:52:54.30 --> 02:52:59.58
hours to recover from being awake for 16 hours is because you're essentially,

2403
02:53:01.42 --> 02:53:05.98
you're essentially stripping yourself of resources and you're building up waste products, right? So

2404
02:53:05.98 --> 02:53:10.06
every cell in your body is like a miniature version of you. What do you do? Like you're awake

2405
02:53:10.06 --> 02:53:14.46
a certain portion of the day, you're asleep a certain portion of the day, you take in nutrients,

2406
02:53:14.46 --> 02:53:21.66
you do work with that nutrients and you create waste products, right? And your cell has to do

2407
02:53:21.66 --> 02:53:26.62
all of that, right? And so your cells are producing waste products. A lot of that stuff isn't cleared

2408
02:53:26.62 --> 02:53:30.14
out while you're awake. It has to be cleared out where you're asleep, especially in the brain.

2409
02:53:31.82 --> 02:53:36.78
So if you don't do that, and let's say it's mildly toxic, so it's causing some inflammation,

2410
02:53:37.98 --> 02:53:41.90
and then you don't get enough sleep. And especially like you stay up all night, well,

2411
02:53:41.90 --> 02:53:46.38
you know, you have, you know, you're going through tomorrow and you're just building up more waste

2412
02:53:46.38 --> 02:53:51.90
products. And so that's sort of damaging you know, not hugely, it's not like it's not gonna

2413
02:53:52.94 --> 02:53:57.98
you cause some sort of noticeable brain damage, but just a slight impairment, right? Maybe a

2414
02:53:57.98 --> 02:54:04.54
little inflammation, it's maybe strips some cells, some nutrients or something. So I say it's like

2415
02:54:04.54 --> 02:54:10.54
if you break your leg, and you just walk around on your broken leg until it heals, it's still gonna

2416
02:54:10.54 --> 02:54:15.82
heal. So to some degree at some point, you're just going to become the functional new you.

2417
02:54:17.26 --> 02:54:25.18
Now, how badly it's broken and how well it repairs will determine how good the new you is. But if

2418
02:54:25.18 --> 02:54:29.26
you break your leg and you go see a doctor and you line everything back up and you make sure that

2419
02:54:29.26 --> 02:54:33.02
everything's right there and you put a cast on it and you take the weight off of it. And like

2420
02:54:33.02 --> 02:54:37.90
now when that repairs, that bone's actually stronger, but there's still like a scar tissue in

2421
02:54:37.90 --> 02:54:42.62
there. I can still get to an x-ray and say, oh, that was broken there. That bone might actually be

2422
02:54:42.62 --> 02:54:46.94
better than I was, but there's some noticeable changes. There's some noticeable difference in

2423
02:54:46.94 --> 02:54:52.86
there. Whereas you didn't repair it as quickly as you could. And maybe there's a lot of deformity

2424
02:54:52.86 --> 02:54:58.86
and a lot of problems. It's a weak metaphor, but it's the best thing I have. So paying back your

2425
02:54:58.86 --> 02:55:07.10
sleep debt does rebalance your hormones, rebalance your inflammatory cascades, a lot of your signaling

2426
02:55:07.10 --> 02:55:11.66
molecules that tell your other cells what to do and tell well, tell cells what to do and tell

2427
02:55:11.66 --> 02:55:19.98
cells how to communicate. All of that stuff can be mended. But if there's some damage done in there

2428
02:55:19.98 --> 02:55:26.30
to where like you start, you have some inflammation, you wall off some of the waste products with

2429
02:55:26.30 --> 02:55:30.70
it with like a protein that kind of like encapsulates it, like that's all damage. And so you don't

2430
02:55:31.26 --> 02:55:36.54
necessarily recover 100%. But you can recover your function back. But that doesn't mean that you

2431
02:55:36.54 --> 02:55:38.70
didn't do maybe a little bit of damage here and there. Yeah.

2432
02:55:38.70 --> 02:55:44.46
Interesting. See how complex this is? Bro, it goes deep, right? You better get your rest, Hoang.

2433
02:55:46.06 --> 02:55:47.42
Doc, any closing thoughts, man?

2434
02:55:48.62 --> 02:55:50.22
Oh man, just happy to be here proud to serve.

2435
02:55:55.34 --> 02:55:58.38
I don't know. There's so much to talk about. But

2436
02:55:58.38 --> 02:56:13.50
for people in there not sleeping well, I'd say that's the foundation. I think you get that in

2437
02:56:13.50 --> 02:56:20.70
place. And then that should repair hormones. But if it doesn't, like, work on hormones, and then

2438
02:56:20.70 --> 02:56:26.78
like you and I were talking about outside of it, I think anybody who has some lingering issues after

2439
02:56:26.78 --> 02:56:32.30
that, it's a, you know, go find yourself a doctor that does good peptides that helps regenerate,

2440
02:56:32.30 --> 02:56:36.62
helps changes the cell signaling changes what the cells do a lot like hormones do.

2441
02:56:36.62 --> 02:56:40.46
There's a lot of promising stuff in there. You can, we can probably start fixing some,

2442
02:56:40.46 --> 02:56:43.90
well, we can definitely fix some injuries without surgery now that used to be surgical,

2443
02:56:44.94 --> 02:56:47.10
especially tendons and ligaments and stuff like that. So

2444
02:56:49.34 --> 02:56:51.66
unsolicited advice for your audience.

2445
02:56:51.66 --> 02:56:58.38
No, it's awesome. I know I always, I often get a bad rap for being anti-sleep and I'm certainly

2446
02:56:58.38 --> 02:57:03.02
not. And, you know, even in the book, Discipline, it was freedom field, man. I wrote like, hey,

2447
02:57:03.02 --> 02:57:09.82
you need sleep. You need to get as much sleep as you need to be performing at your optimal levels.

2448
02:57:10.46 --> 02:57:12.30
So yeah, I'm on board.

2449
02:57:13.02 --> 02:57:17.82
So, so, you know, I say eight hours because the research boards out that just somewhere around

2450
02:57:17.82 --> 02:57:23.26
seven and a half hours plus or minus half an hour. So it could be closer to seven. The only way

2451
02:57:23.26 --> 02:57:27.90
anybody really knows how much sleep they need is if they go to bed at the same time every day,

2452
02:57:28.62 --> 02:57:32.62
wake up the same time every day without an alarm clock and they feel good and refreshed.

2453
02:57:32.62 --> 02:57:37.98
You're like, that's the only way to know. And again, that's ideal. What's reality? Like, I don't

2454
02:57:37.98 --> 02:57:42.70
know. There's some, there's a bridge in between those two where we're going to, you know, use gadgets

2455
02:57:42.70 --> 02:57:48.54
and tricks and supplements and things like that, like to help bring reality closer to ideal. But

2456
02:57:48.54 --> 02:57:52.70
that's the only way you'd really know. And that's, and it's not the same every day. Like, the thing is,

2457
02:57:53.34 --> 02:57:58.70
to remember, this is biology. It's not a car. So we're not tuning a carburetor. Like, this is

2458
02:57:58.70 --> 02:58:03.18
biology. It's messy. It's approximate. And you don't, you don't need exactly the same amount of

2459
02:58:03.18 --> 02:58:07.90
sleep tonight as you'll need the next night or the day before. It's like, if I go run an ultra

2460
02:58:07.90 --> 02:58:14.30
marathon today, then I'm like 26 hours in a row of sleep. If I do nothing but lay on my couch and

2461
02:58:14.30 --> 02:58:19.98
watch television, I might get away with six and a half hours of sleep. Like, it's, it's an approximation

2462
02:58:19.98 --> 02:58:25.18
and the whole idea, you know, the preto distribution, like anything else, man, it's like 80% of the

2463
02:58:25.18 --> 02:58:30.54
time you want to be doing the right thing. And that makes you more resilient for the 20% of the

2464
02:58:30.54 --> 02:58:34.46
time when you can't do the right thing, right? Or when you don't want to do the right thing. And,

2465
02:58:34.46 --> 02:58:40.38
and, you know, the trade off is worth it for you. So, you know, the most important part does not to

2466
02:58:40.38 --> 02:58:44.22
be as zealot. And the number one reason people don't sleep well, it's because they're worried about

2467
02:58:44.22 --> 02:58:49.42
not sleeping well. Right. Because they hear something like this. Or I like, they'll hear me on a,

2468
02:58:49.42 --> 02:58:53.98
on a law enforcement podcast or something. And I tell them, shift workers die on average 12 to

2469
02:58:53.98 --> 02:59:00.54
14 years earlier than they're everybody else. Because the World Health Organization classifies

2470
02:59:00.54 --> 02:59:05.58
shift work as a type two a carcinogen, which is the same thing as cigarettes were, which means

2471
02:59:05.58 --> 02:59:10.14
we're pretty damn sure this causes cancer, but it would be unethical to test that like we can't do

2472
02:59:10.14 --> 02:59:17.02
research and cause cancer in people. So it's a type two a carcinogen. And your risk of heart attack

2473
02:59:17.02 --> 02:59:22.78
stroke, like everything increases, because you're sleeping against your circadian rhythm, right.

2474
02:59:22.78 --> 02:59:28.14
And so they hear something like that. Now they're panicked, because like, well, I work shiftwork,

2475
02:59:28.14 --> 02:59:34.46
I don't want to die. I don't want to die 12 years earlier. So what do I do? And so the number one

2476
02:59:34.46 --> 02:59:37.42
reason people don't sleep well is because they're worried about not sleeping well.

2477
02:59:39.58 --> 02:59:44.62
Maybe that's one of the reasons I sleep well. Chill out. Chill out. Chill out. Do what I said,

2478
02:59:44.62 --> 02:59:50.86
like download that worksheet and do what I said. Get in bed. Like get in bed for eight hours a

2479
02:59:50.86 --> 02:59:58.38
night, like figure out a way to do that. That's not impossible. I realize that it's not necessarily

2480
02:59:58.38 --> 03:00:05.02
100% possible for 100% of people, but do the best you can to do that. And let it be what it is.

2481
03:00:05.02 --> 03:00:08.46
Like you'll help people say, Oh, you can't go, you can't go to sleep, get up and get out of your

2482
03:00:08.46 --> 03:00:12.78
bed. You don't want to associate your bed without with not sleeping. And so then go sit in the living

2483
03:00:12.78 --> 03:00:17.98
room and read a book or something and then come back. And when you feel tired, I don't agree.

2484
03:00:17.98 --> 03:00:26.06
Like I have not seen that work well. And I mean, I've been doing this for 12, 13 years now. I've

2485
03:00:26.06 --> 03:00:35.18
been having people on this and I don't see any way around the fact that if I get up and read,

2486
03:00:35.18 --> 03:00:39.98
I'm not doing myself any benefit. Right? If I lay in bed and meditate, at least my stress

2487
03:00:39.98 --> 03:00:45.02
hormone is lower. At least I'm getting some non sleep rest now. So just lay in bed. And the only

2488
03:00:45.02 --> 03:00:49.26
reason that you're going to associate with negative thoughts is if you're stressed out about not

2489
03:00:49.26 --> 03:00:52.30
sleeping. So if you're not stressed out, you're just going, Well, I'm just going to meditate.

2490
03:00:52.30 --> 03:00:55.58
Like, well, then it's not just a place to meditate and sleep and have sex. Like,

2491
03:00:56.46 --> 03:01:00.78
why not? Like all those are great things. Like just be in there as much as you can be. So

2492
03:01:01.34 --> 03:01:04.78
I think Echo's next tattoo is going to say, get in bed, stay in bed.

2493
03:01:08.22 --> 03:01:13.74
Maybe. My son, he wrote like this commercial for me. I couldn't find anyone to work in it.

2494
03:01:13.74 --> 03:01:18.86
To work to act in it. Because everybody's like, Oh, like all the team guys are like, Oh, it's

2495
03:01:18.86 --> 03:01:23.42
cheap. Like I don't because it says like, you know, my badass or whatever. It's like, badass is

2496
03:01:23.42 --> 03:01:29.18
like me or something. And whatever. And then like, I can't afford any SAG actor because they,

2497
03:01:29.18 --> 03:01:33.18
like you got to pay and have insurance and all this stuff. And so I never did it making it.

2498
03:01:33.18 --> 03:01:37.90
But at the end of it, he's like, So what are you waiting for? Wake up, get some sleep.

2499
03:01:37.90 --> 03:01:43.18
Oh, that's cool. But that's like a tagline in the back. We have like t-shirts or that and stuff.

2500
03:01:44.06 --> 03:01:50.46
Wake up, get some sleep. Awesome, man. Well, thanks for coming down. Also,

2501
03:01:51.02 --> 03:01:54.54
anyone that's listening to this podcast right now at this time, or if you've ever listened to this

2502
03:01:54.54 --> 03:02:00.54
podcast before, you can thank Doc Parsley. Because if it wasn't for Doc Parsley, this podcast wouldn't

2503
03:02:00.54 --> 03:02:08.46
exist. Why is that? Because Doc Parsley introduced me to Peter Atia and said,

2504
03:02:09.50 --> 03:02:16.86
Jocko should go on Tim Ferriss's podcast. So that, that is literally the one little pivot

2505
03:02:16.86 --> 03:02:20.46
in my life where I was like, Oh, you know, I meet Peter and Peter's like, Yep,

2506
03:02:21.10 --> 03:02:26.46
tells Tim, you should have this guy on. And there it was. I went on Tim Ferriss's podcast and

2507
03:02:26.46 --> 03:02:30.94
Tim Ferriss, when we got done recording, he looked at me and said, You should have your own

2508
03:02:30.94 --> 03:02:36.14
podcast. And I was like, Hmm, that, that could be a thing. And then Joe Rogan heard that podcast

2509
03:02:36.14 --> 03:02:39.74
and invited me in his podcast immediately. And then in the middle of that podcast, he said,

2510
03:02:39.74 --> 03:02:43.42
You should have your own podcast. And so between those two guys, I started this podcast. So,

2511
03:02:43.42 --> 03:02:47.82
well, when the kind of two top podcasters tell you that you should have a podcast,

2512
03:02:47.82 --> 03:02:55.82
you know, it's funny. The first podcast I ever did was Rob Wolse. And it was because

2513
03:02:56.78 --> 03:03:00.94
he was at my house, I think we're doing a, one of the pre or post retreats,

2514
03:03:02.30 --> 03:03:07.58
maybe not, but we're definitely lecturing at the same event. And so he was staying at my house.

2515
03:03:07.58 --> 03:03:11.26
And he all of a sudden goes, Oh, shit, I'm supposed to be on a podcast. You want to do a

2516
03:03:11.26 --> 03:03:18.62
podcast? I'm like, Yeah, what's the podcast? And so I get, I, so we sit down with like a computer

2517
03:03:18.62 --> 03:03:24.78
between us. And, and he's, and it's like on the armrest in between the two of us. And we just

2518
03:03:24.78 --> 03:03:29.58
talking this computer and like, I don't know, I'm not the slightest bit nervous or concerned,

2519
03:03:29.58 --> 03:03:35.98
because I don't know what the hell it's like, I'm just talking around. And then he, he calls me,

2520
03:03:35.98 --> 03:03:40.86
and then maybe like two weeks later, and he goes, Here's dude, you got to do your own podcast.

2521
03:03:41.42 --> 03:03:48.54
I'm like, why? And he's like, he's at Ferris on eight weeks ago. And your podcast has more

2522
03:03:48.54 --> 03:03:54.46
downloads than his double the podcast downloads his and it's only been up for two weeks. And I was

2523
03:03:54.46 --> 03:04:01.50
like, what's a download? Anyway, so he tried to talk me into doing my own podcast. And I'm like,

2524
03:04:01.50 --> 03:04:04.94
I don't know, like, when I'm going to do podcasts on sleep, like that doesn't seem,

2525
03:04:04.94 --> 03:04:09.10
doesn't seem sustainable. Like you can't do 400 episodes on sleep. Like maybe I guess,

2526
03:04:09.10 --> 03:04:16.54
maybe you can. And that's the only thing anybody knew me for. So yeah, I think it would be cool

2527
03:04:16.54 --> 03:04:21.26
because I'd like to, there's lots of people I'd like to talk to. But I don't know how the work

2528
03:04:21.26 --> 03:04:27.82
ethic and time I do it. I just like, I travel so much like I don't, I'd be scattered like trying

2529
03:04:27.82 --> 03:04:33.02
to compress doing 10 in a day or something. I got to know, like, it's more work than people think.

2530
03:04:33.02 --> 03:04:37.10
It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. Yeah. I think people don't realize what goes into it. But

2531
03:04:38.54 --> 03:04:43.42
well, like I said, if it wasn't for you, introduce me to Peter and then to Tim.

2532
03:04:43.42 --> 03:04:48.70
Well, well, I think you got to give yourself plenty of credit. I mean, lots of guys have been

2533
03:04:48.70 --> 03:04:56.86
on this podcast has not done with you. Not done with you done. Well, but yeah, we knew the,

2534
03:04:56.86 --> 03:05:02.78
we knew the Joker legend spread. Well, I appreciated it, man. Yeah. And it's my pleasure.

2535
03:05:02.78 --> 03:05:05.18
Yeah. Thanks for coming down. Thanks for having me.

2536
03:05:05.18 --> 03:05:09.90
Obviously, thanks for your service. Thanks for what you did in the teams, holding the line.

2537
03:05:10.78 --> 03:05:16.54
And, you know, especially for when you got done with the teams coming back and taking care of

2538
03:05:16.54 --> 03:05:20.70
the teams and the team guys. And thanks for what you're doing today to continue to take care of

2539
03:05:20.70 --> 03:05:25.42
them and take care of other people, man. Appreciate it. Yeah. Definitely. It's definitely my honor.

2540
03:05:25.42 --> 03:05:30.54
Like it truly is my favorite thing to do. If I could just do, if I could just work with

2541
03:05:30.54 --> 03:05:37.90
SF guys and like, I do that all day. Like it's, it's on like, you know, the communities just like

2542
03:05:39.42 --> 03:05:44.14
cool. It's cool guys to treat and they're not fucking entitled little bitches. They're going

2543
03:05:44.14 --> 03:05:49.02
to call me every hour. So like, like, they apologize for calling me once every three months.

2544
03:05:49.02 --> 03:05:54.38
They're like, Hey, I'm really sorry, but I ran out of men like six weeks ago.

2545
03:05:54.38 --> 03:06:01.10
So yeah. So it's a, it's a great community. And like I said, it, you know, the team's

2546
03:06:01.10 --> 03:06:07.90
solely turned my life around. Like there's no way I would have achieved 10% of what I've

2547
03:06:07.90 --> 03:06:14.70
achieved in my life if I hadn't gone there first. So like, I, there's no amount of payback for that.

2548
03:06:14.70 --> 03:06:18.46
It's like, I'm indebted to that organization for the rest of my life. So,

2549
03:06:18.46 --> 03:06:25.26
you know, you and me both, man. Awesome. Thanks for coming out, bro. Yeah. Thank you. With that,

2550
03:06:25.26 --> 03:06:33.90
Kirk Parsley has left the building echo probably your most beloved podcast you've heard.

2551
03:06:33.90 --> 03:06:39.18
We'll say it's my cup of tea. It's your cup of tea. Talking about the fact that rest is

2552
03:06:40.38 --> 03:06:43.50
important. As you have to say. Yeah.

2553
03:06:43.50 --> 03:06:48.38
Right. He was talking, when you guys were talking about the fast Twitch, slow Twitch, and you know,

2554
03:06:48.38 --> 03:06:55.26
like your intermediate Twitch, bro, that was like, I never categorized even though I understand,

2555
03:06:55.26 --> 03:07:02.30
I understand. And so I was like, like him where sprinting cool, even if I get in good shape,

2556
03:07:02.30 --> 03:07:06.30
bro, I'll sprint all day as long as I get some rest between the sets, you know, kind of a thing.

2557
03:07:06.30 --> 03:07:10.14
But bro, put me on the bike or running or something, bro. I feel like I'm suffering the

2558
03:07:10.14 --> 03:07:15.18
whole time. I still do it. And then even when I'm done, if I'm in normal shape or whatever,

2559
03:07:15.18 --> 03:07:19.82
if when I'm done, I don't feel super gassed. It's just that I'm suffering so much during the run.

2560
03:07:20.62 --> 03:07:24.30
That's how I felt. And I wish I should have looked it up. I know we're going to cover that subject,

2561
03:07:24.30 --> 03:07:31.10
but I remember reading an article and they had discovered this new intermediate Twitch muscle.

2562
03:07:31.10 --> 03:07:37.34
And I was like, that's me. And I felt like, I felt like so good because it made sense. Okay.

2563
03:07:37.34 --> 03:07:44.38
Because like I said, I was never winning any sprints. And I was never winning any 14 mile runs.

2564
03:07:45.50 --> 03:07:49.98
But on a rucksack, we're just like, Hey, you got to put out for a long period of time and be a

2565
03:07:49.98 --> 03:07:55.42
little bit strong. I was good at that grappling is the same. And by the way, my grappling, my, my

2566
03:07:56.62 --> 03:08:01.58
physical genetics, they're good for a particular kind of grappling. And it's actually, unfortunately

2567
03:08:01.58 --> 03:08:06.14
for you, it's the kind of grappling that you and I do. Right. Like you have the genetics for a three

2568
03:08:06.14 --> 03:08:10.30
minute round or two, three minute rounds or something like this. I have good genetics for

2569
03:08:11.10 --> 03:08:17.10
38 minutes. Yeah. You know, well, I, yeah, and I would put it this way, yours, you're good for 38

2570
03:08:17.10 --> 03:08:23.42
minutes going like putting on, yeah, putting on some heat. Yeah. Look, you're not exploding through

2571
03:08:23.42 --> 03:08:28.06
stuff, which actually in Jiu Jitsu, you should probably avoid exploding into and out of stuff.

2572
03:08:28.06 --> 03:08:33.34
Unless it's a seven minute match, you know, unless it's seven minutes, if it's a seven minute match,

2573
03:08:33.34 --> 03:08:36.86
I'm going to, you know, you're getting the takedown. Like if you and I went in a set, if you and I

2574
03:08:36.86 --> 03:08:41.90
did a tournament right now, a tournament match, 10 minutes would be problematic for you. So we

2575
03:08:41.90 --> 03:08:45.34
couldn't even go black belt. We'd have to go like blue belt, like five minute or six minute

2576
03:08:45.34 --> 03:08:51.18
match. You could win with, you know, you could win even, I would say more like a three. Okay.

2577
03:08:51.18 --> 03:08:55.82
Three minute match, you could win six minute match. Probably going to be here. Yeah. After that four

2578
03:08:55.82 --> 03:09:02.78
and a half, five. Yeah. Yeah. You could get like some kind of a takedown, maybe even though the

2579
03:09:02.78 --> 03:09:06.30
problem with you trying to get a takedown on me is you, you would be too threatened by the guillotine

2580
03:09:06.30 --> 03:09:09.66
and you'd probably not go for it. And you probably lose. That's true. See, and now you're talking,

2581
03:09:10.30 --> 03:09:16.38
and this is not, I didn't strategic on you though. Yes. Which I would be doing anyways, by the way.

2582
03:09:16.38 --> 03:09:20.06
Yeah. So, which is a good point actually. So look, we're talking about Jiu Jitsu here, right?

2583
03:09:20.06 --> 03:09:23.50
Even though before we're talking about kind of like endurance and condition, whatever. So Jiu

2584
03:09:23.50 --> 03:09:27.82
Jitsu, the mental part of Jiu Jitsu is way more important than the physical part of it. We're

2585
03:09:27.82 --> 03:09:32.14
like getting excited and like all these things and what I'm going to do, well, how much you know,

2586
03:09:32.14 --> 03:09:36.14
compared to how much I know, what you know about my, like all this stuff, like is such a huge

2587
03:09:36.14 --> 03:09:41.26
factor. So just keep that in mind. So we're just talking essentially like nuts to nuts. If me

2588
03:09:41.26 --> 03:09:46.62
in my physical attributes and a given or we'll say standard amount of not Jiu Jitsu knowledge

2589
03:09:46.62 --> 03:09:52.94
versus you and your physical attributes versus the same amount of like knowledge, just the physical

2590
03:09:52.94 --> 03:09:59.10
attributes, it would be problematic for me anything after four and a half minutes, I would say.

2591
03:09:59.10 --> 03:10:04.06
That's if we were even on everything else, even on knowledge basically. Yeah. Because we're both

2592
03:10:04.06 --> 03:10:10.78
about, I mean, we're both like 225. Yeah. And we're both the same height. And so, so that's a

2593
03:10:10.78 --> 03:10:16.70
pretty good even match. Yeah. But I just know more than you do. Yeah. But if we took that away

2594
03:10:16.70 --> 03:10:22.70
and we were just you against me with the same brain, the same knowledge, you'd be good for

2595
03:10:22.70 --> 03:10:27.26
a little bit of time. Actually, I might, I could probably turn up the heat for a good two, two and

2596
03:10:27.26 --> 03:10:33.26
a half minutes and maybe get the better. But bro, that heaviness and that like after a while,

2597
03:10:33.26 --> 03:10:37.90
I'm like, bro, just just kill me. Yeah. And I could survive two and a half minutes pretty much

2598
03:10:37.90 --> 03:10:42.38
with any. So that makes sense when you're talking about the rock where like someone like me would

2599
03:10:42.38 --> 03:10:49.90
be like, rock this light, do that for like 1020 30 minutes, bro, no ways. I want to want to take

2600
03:10:49.90 --> 03:10:53.90
that thing off. Like after a few minutes or whatever, but it'll feel like that'll get heavy

2601
03:10:53.90 --> 03:11:00.14
real quick. And then you and then an endurance guy, brother, things can be heavy immediately.

2602
03:11:00.14 --> 03:11:06.78
Yeah. Like it's kind of two, like I can jog pretty easily even with a rock, even with a rock that's

2603
03:11:06.78 --> 03:11:14.06
like 75 pounds, I can jog like jog. It's going to put a hurt on some guys that are a little bit

2604
03:11:14.06 --> 03:11:19.74
smaller, you know, or that have so much endurance muscle. So it made sense, man. And thinking back

2605
03:11:19.74 --> 03:11:24.22
to all my experiences where I'm suffering, you know, and again, it's not like I can't do it,

2606
03:11:24.22 --> 03:11:28.06
but I feel like, bro, these guys running have to be suffering way less than that.

2607
03:11:28.06 --> 03:11:35.58
He trained for a couple of years and got worse at triathlon. That's crazy. So it's crazy. All right,

2608
03:11:35.58 --> 03:11:40.30
but I know you like you because we talked about rest. You're a proponent. Oh, yeah. One of the

2609
03:11:40.30 --> 03:11:44.70
best. One of the best at resting. You're probably the best wrestler that I've ever known. Probably

2610
03:11:44.70 --> 03:11:48.22
used to be, you know, the kind where like you can fall asleep. The people used to be. Well,

2611
03:11:48.22 --> 03:11:54.06
you know, I'm a little bit spoiled where like if someone has like, like if I go to hotel bed and

2612
03:11:54.06 --> 03:12:02.46
the pillow is not the right thickness, you know, like, oh, it'll change. Or the, or the, or the bed

2613
03:12:02.46 --> 03:12:06.22
is like kind of like, no, I don't know. Oh yeah. Cause you stay in the luxury hotel. I understand.

2614
03:12:06.22 --> 03:12:10.70
It's actually, here's it. Here's like a little thing I feel bad about. Sometimes I'll go and do

2615
03:12:10.70 --> 03:12:16.78
an event for somebody and they'll put me in, you know, the presidential suite, right? Hell yeah.

2616
03:12:16.78 --> 03:12:19.98
And then I'll come down in the morning. How was the room? And I'm always like,

2617
03:12:20.78 --> 03:12:25.02
it was great, you know, but in my mind, I literally do not care at all.

2618
03:12:25.02 --> 03:12:28.78
But I remember the time and I'm damn sure not going, well, you know, the pedal,

2619
03:12:28.78 --> 03:12:33.42
pedal, pillow is a little stand for whatever it is you just said. It's too soft. No. Okay. Remember

2620
03:12:33.42 --> 03:12:38.54
the time it was you, you went somewhere like, and you stayed at, I don't know, you didn't have a

2621
03:12:38.54 --> 03:12:42.62
hotel or something. So you stayed at like Jamie's rental house. I don't know. So you stayed somewhere

2622
03:12:42.62 --> 03:12:50.62
like in someone's like an occupied house. And you didn't have any blankets or anything. So you got

2623
03:12:50.62 --> 03:12:56.46
like a shower curtain. That wasn't Jamie's unoccupied house. That was? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

2624
03:12:56.46 --> 03:13:00.06
Brad, you told me that story and this was like well into your career. So it's not like you were

2625
03:13:00.06 --> 03:13:05.90
just, that was like a year ago. Actually, no, there's Jocko live. It was 2020. Just bro,

2626
03:13:05.90 --> 03:13:10.14
bro, that story like, of course made me laugh. But bra was suffering with you mentally. I was like,

2627
03:13:10.14 --> 03:13:15.34
bro, no pillow, like, and you're just battling through it, like whatever, bro, that couldn't

2628
03:13:15.34 --> 03:13:22.22
have done it. I would have canceled the show. A shower curtain and a rug or something. I was like,

2629
03:13:22.22 --> 03:13:28.30
bro, no way, bro. No, no way. Jack. All right. Well, you need rest. You're gonna need fuel.

2630
03:13:28.30 --> 03:13:35.10
Another component. It's true. As they say. Yeah. Of physical fitness rest and get that fuel.

2631
03:13:35.10 --> 03:13:40.14
Exercise rest fuel. That's the three components for getting stronger. Sir. So,

2632
03:13:40.14 --> 03:13:44.78
Jocko fuel. What do we got? Kind of everything now. We have pretty much everything now.

2633
03:13:45.42 --> 03:13:51.10
So we'll go discipline. That's the energy drink, new paradigm, all healthy. No, not healthy, all

2634
03:13:51.10 --> 03:13:56.46
healthy. No sugar, no preservatives, no nothing and tastes good. All upside. Yeah. All upside.

2635
03:13:57.34 --> 03:14:02.22
Also, Mooc. That's the extra protein. And you need extra protein when you're trying to build.

2636
03:14:02.22 --> 03:14:06.78
It's hard to get all the protein you need, by the way. For real. How much protein you think you need?

2637
03:14:07.42 --> 03:14:15.34
Well, you know, I usually have seven ounces of protein per pound of lean body. Ounces.

2638
03:14:17.18 --> 03:14:22.22
It's one gram per, right? That's like the standard one gram per. Some people say 0.7 grams per.

2639
03:14:22.22 --> 03:14:30.22
I say one gram per pound. Okay. So if you're going Jocko philosophy, that's if you weigh 220.

2640
03:14:30.22 --> 03:14:39.50
220 grams of protein. Yep. You got 30 grams of protein, one can of tuna. 30. So you need,

2641
03:14:40.30 --> 03:14:44.54
how many of those? A lot. It's freaking a lot in one day, bro. That's a lot of protein.

2642
03:14:45.34 --> 03:14:48.14
Now, if you eat steaks, it's like, I was like, I have to work it out for you.

2643
03:14:52.62 --> 03:14:56.38
If you eat a steak that's like, like what, 50? 50 grams of protein? Yeah.

2644
03:14:56.38 --> 03:15:00.78
Yeah. So you need four steaks in one day, but I get real. You know, not all of us can eat four

2645
03:15:00.78 --> 03:15:05.18
steaks, but when you get the roll the mokin through the equation, right? Easy money. And it tastes

2646
03:15:05.18 --> 03:15:08.38
good. It's like a dessert. It ain't going to help you with your math, though, Bernadette.

2647
03:15:09.26 --> 03:15:15.26
That's what the discipline is for right there. Anyway, we've got some other stuff. Stuff for

2648
03:15:15.26 --> 03:15:21.02
your joints, keep you in the game. Creatine. Back on the creatine train. Yeah. Right. That was a thing.

2649
03:15:21.02 --> 03:15:26.46
And then because it's so, it's so well studied. That's the cool thing about it. Yeah. And the

2650
03:15:26.46 --> 03:15:29.58
cool thing about it now is they're finding it's not just, it's not just for getting stronger.

2651
03:15:29.58 --> 03:15:34.30
There's all kinds of, there's cognitive benefits. There's health benefits. So creatine, we just

2652
03:15:34.30 --> 03:15:42.46
rolled out with that joint warfare, super grill immunity stuff. It's kind of everything. You

2653
03:15:42.46 --> 03:15:47.10
know what I have to remember how this is a real thing, getting sick when you take a break. Remember

2654
03:15:47.10 --> 03:15:53.58
that? Getting sick when you take a break. It was Huberman. If I was telling Huberman, or he mentioned

2655
03:15:53.58 --> 03:15:59.42
something about when your body kind of when your mind stands down, like, oh, you have a break now,

2656
03:15:59.42 --> 03:16:03.82
your body's like, oh, cool, we can get sick now real quick. Just get, you know, and that happens.

2657
03:16:03.82 --> 03:16:11.18
That has happened to me like legitimately five times in the past 20 years where I had, okay,

2658
03:16:11.18 --> 03:16:14.94
I've been going up, going hard, working really hard. And then I finally get a break and I immediately

2659
03:16:14.94 --> 03:16:21.34
get sick. And so I'm, you know, cranking the cold war to keep that stuff at bay.

2660
03:16:22.06 --> 03:16:25.18
Yeah, all that anti-inflammatory stuff, man, is good.

2661
03:16:25.18 --> 03:16:26.78
Jocofuel.com.

2662
03:16:28.70 --> 03:16:36.46

Yeah. Oh yeah, big time. Also, don't forget about the jeans, the belts, the boots.

2669
03:17:13.82 --> 03:17:18.06
Don't forget about that kind of stuff. That stuff is like a big deal because nowadays it's hard to

2670
03:17:18.06 --> 03:17:22.38
grab, get those stuff, the stuff that's made in America, but for real, made in America.

2671
03:17:22.38 --> 03:17:27.58
From the dirt. Yeah. From its inception as a thought, it's made in America.

2672
03:17:27.58 --> 03:17:32.38
When someone thought about it, it was in America. Yeah, it's true. So there you go.

2679
03:18:04.06 --> 03:18:09.02
to do with the path though. Always. The designs always have to do with the path. Now, for you to

2680
03:18:09.02 --> 03:18:13.18
understand, it's going to take some, some mental work, but it's kind of fun. But anyway, a lot of

03:18:13.18 --> 03:18:16.54
people like it. There's a reward to it. There's a reward to it. It's called the shirt locker. It's

2707
03:20:44.54 --> 03:20:50.54
Doc Parsley. And for us, Echo, is that Echo Charles? He's back on Twitter, by the way.

2708
03:20:50.54 --> 03:20:58.86
Are you engaging? Sparsely. But you know, I'm gonna engage more, I think. I hope. I'm gonna try.

2709
03:21:00.22 --> 03:21:05.10
Maybe. Well, anyways, I guess it's not really worth following Echo Charles on Twitter if he's got

2710
03:21:05.10 --> 03:21:11.58
that kind of attitude. I'm on Twitter. I'm on Facebook. I'm on the Instagram. Echo Charles on

2711
03:21:11.58 --> 03:21:15.34
all those things too. Echoes at Echo Charles. I'm at Jocko Willink. Watch out for the algorithm.

2712
03:21:15.34 --> 03:21:23.50
It'll get you. Thanks to, again, to Doc Parsley for what he's doing and what he has done. And thanks

2713
03:21:23.50 --> 03:21:30.38
to people out there in uniform, pushing your body to the breaking point to protect our great nation.

2714
03:21:30.94 --> 03:21:36.62
That's what Doc was talking about. You do that job, whatever you're doing in uniform,

2715
03:21:36.62 --> 03:21:43.18
and you're sacrificing your body to protect the country. So we thank you all for what you do,

2716
03:21:43.18 --> 03:21:46.86
everyone in uniform. And the same goes for police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

2717
03:21:46.86 --> 03:21:51.34
EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

2718
03:21:51.34 --> 03:21:56.22
You heard what Doc said about shift work when you're staying up opposite hours and every one

2719
03:21:56.22 --> 03:22:03.10
of those jobs I just mentioned, you all do that. You also sacrifice your bodies to keep us safe.

2720
03:22:04.06 --> 03:22:07.82
So thank you for what you all do every day. And everyone else out there.

2721
03:22:07.82 --> 03:22:18.70
Yeah, look, you got to push hard. But you do need to get rest. You do need to recover. That is critical

2722
03:22:18.70 --> 03:22:25.82
for growth and for health. That being said, just do me a favor. Don't lie to yourself.

2723
03:22:27.26 --> 03:22:31.18
Because there's some people are going to take this and run with it. They're going to make rest the

2724
03:22:31.18 --> 03:22:36.62
priority of their existence. And I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying don't rest, rest. You heard

2725
03:22:36.62 --> 03:22:44.62
me. You heard Doc, you heard Echo Charles chiming in. But when it's time to get up, get up and use

2726
03:22:44.62 --> 03:22:51.50
the day to make yourself tired so you can sleep well. And the way you make yourself tired is of

2727
03:22:51.50 --> 03:23:09.98
course by going out there and getting after it. And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
