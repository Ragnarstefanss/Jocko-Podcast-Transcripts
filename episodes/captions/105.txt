[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 105 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:10] Specialist Viera was witness to scenes of horror.
[00:00:15] The enemy was all over, at least a couple hundred of them walking around for three or four minutes. It seemed like three or four hours.
[00:00:22] They were shooting and machine gunning or wounded and laughing and giggling.
[00:00:30] I knew they'd kill me if they saw I was alive. When they got near, I played dead.
[00:00:37] I kept my eyes open and stared at a small tree. I knew that dead men had their eyes open.
[00:00:44] Viera continues. Then one of the north Vietnamese came up, looked at me, then kicked me and I flopped over.
[00:00:55] I guess he thought I was dead. It was blood running out of my mouth, my arm, my legs.
[00:01:02] He took my watch and my 45 caliber pistol and walked on.
[00:01:06] I watched them strip off all our weapons. They left, then they left, back where they came from.
[00:01:15] I remember the artillery, the bombs, the Nae Palm everywhere, real close around me.
[00:01:21] It shook the ground underneath me. But it was coming in on the north Vietnamese soldiers too.
[00:01:27] All this and more, much more, took place between 6.50 a.m. and 7.40 a.m. on November 15th, 1965.
[00:01:42] The agonies of Charlie Company occurred over 140 yards of the line.
[00:01:48] But men were fighting and dying on three sides of our thinly held American perimeter.
[00:01:52] In the center, I held the lives of all of these men in my hands.
[00:02:01] The badly wounded Captain Bob Edwards was on the radio now asking for reinforcements.
[00:02:07] The only reserve I had was a reconnaissance platoon 22 men.
[00:02:12] Was the attack on Charlie Company, the main enemy threat, Delta Company and the combined mortar
[00:02:18] position were also under attack now. Reluctantly, I told Captain Edwards that his company would
[00:02:24] have to fight on alone for the time being. The den of the battle was unbelievable.
[00:02:32] Rifles and machine guns and mortars and grenades rattled banged and boomed.
[00:02:38] Two batteries of 105 millimeter hoitzers, 12 big guns located on another landing zone,
[00:02:44] five miles distant were firing nonstop. Their shells exploding no more than 50 yards outside
[00:02:50] the ring of shallow foxholes. Beside me, in the battalion command posts, the Air Force Ford
[00:02:57] controller Lieutenant Charlie W. Hastings 26 from La Mesa, New Mexico, Radio to Special Code
[00:03:03] Word, Broken Arrow, meaning American unit in danger of being overrun. And within a short period
[00:03:12] of time, every available fighter bomber in South Vietnam would stack overhead at a thousand
[00:03:17] foot intervals from 7,000 feet to 35,000 feet waiting its turn to deliver bombs and
[00:03:23] napoms to the battlefield. Among my sergeants, there were three war men, men who perished
[00:03:32] you didn't ignore me on D-Day and had survived the war in Korea. And those old veterans were
[00:03:38] shocked by the savagery and hellish noise of this battle. Choking clouds of smoke and dust
[00:03:45] obscured the killing ground. We were dry mouthed and our bowels churned with fear and still
[00:03:53] the enemy came on in waves. And that right there is from the opening chapter of the book
[00:04:08] we were soldiers once and young, by general how more and Joe Galaway. And the book which was
[00:04:18] turned into a movie, which I saw when it came out in 2002, Mel Gibson. It's a good movie,
[00:04:29] for sure. But it's also a Hollywood movie and Hollywood movies, they're forced to fit
[00:04:38] into two hours and they got to follow some kind of a plot and they can't dig into the details
[00:04:43] and I can't really give you a comprehensive understanding of the events. And I purposely did not
[00:04:49] watch this movie again while preparing for this podcast because I didn't want it in there.
[00:04:55] And it went, it in my brain, the movies interpretation of the characters in it and the way
[00:05:02] that they were portrayed. And the book is so good. And it's so packed with detail and drama and action
[00:05:12] and an utterly incomprehensible heroism. Everyone should read this book.
[00:05:24] Everyone. It starts off, it explains the way the battle unfolded and it talks how it went
[00:05:32] tactically, operationally and strategically goes through all those levels of warfare.
[00:05:38] And you can see in the book how strategy unfolds at the tactical level and how tactical situations
[00:05:45] impact strategy is well you can see it on both sides and there's also which is interesting.
[00:05:50] There's significant commentary from the Vietnamese enemy leadership that they went back and
[00:05:55] interviewed after the war was over. Which just makes it an incredible book and like I said,
[00:06:00] everyone should read it. So it tells the story of operations in the I-Drain Valley in 1965
[00:06:07] from November 14 until November 18. So five days. But the fighting as was noted in that opening chapter
[00:06:20] is absolutely brutal. Leadership is tested over and over and over again.
[00:06:28] And this battle took place with battalions and companies from the seventh cavalry
[00:06:34] regiment. And if you remember the books we covered on general George Custer, he was a officer
[00:06:41] that led seventh cavalry troops in the battle little big horn of where he was surrounded.
[00:06:47] And he was killed along with 267 of his soldiers, all of them dead,
[00:06:53] by the Native American warriors on the suicide from the Lakota and the Dakota and the northern
[00:07:00] Cheyenne and the Arapot tribes. And cavalry in those days meant horseback. That's what
[00:07:08] meant. That's what mounted cavalry. That's what it was. And in 1965 they adopted cavalry to a new
[00:07:17] kind of seed, a new form of transport and this was the helicopter. And in 1965 they converted the
[00:07:24] 11th aerosol test division to the first cavalry division. And the first and second battalions
[00:07:35] of the first cavalry division soon took on the historical name of General Custer's unit. And
[00:07:42] by the way General Custer's seventh calf, even though that's kind of the most famous,
[00:07:47] along with this I guess, along with the I drink valley, but the seventh calf served in
[00:07:55] World War II and Korea, all kinds of incredible service there. And a lot of that is covered in the
[00:08:02] book. But again we'll have to move through this a little bit more quickly. Otherwise,
[00:08:11] go read the book, which I highly recommend. But let's get into it starting about where
[00:08:20] Lieutenant Colonel Halmore takes over the first battalion at 7th cavalry. Going back to the book.
[00:08:28] On Monday, June 29th as scheduled I took command of my battalion. I was 42 years old,
[00:08:34] the West Point graduate of the class of 1945 with 19 years commission service, including 14
[00:08:39] month tour in Korea, combat tour in Korea. In a brief talk to the troops afterward, I told them that
[00:08:47] this was a good battalion, but it would get better. I will do my best, I said, and I expect the same
[00:08:54] from each of you. Before taking command, I had a long talk with the most important man in any
[00:09:00] battalion, the sergeant major. Basil L. Plumbly, 44 years old, and six and a six foot two-inch
[00:09:10] bare of a man hailed from West Virginia. The men sometimes called him old iron jaw, but never in his hearing.
[00:09:20] Plumbly was a two-war man and war master parachute wings with his five combat jump stars.
[00:09:26] He was what the young airborne types called a Ford jump bastard. Plumbly had survived all four
[00:09:34] combat jumps of the 82nd airborne division in World War II, Sicily and Soleno in 1943,
[00:09:41] then in 1944, D-Day at Normandy and Market Garden in the Netherlands. For that matter, he also made
[00:09:49] one combat parachute jump in the Korean War with 187th airborne infantry regiment.
[00:09:55] He ended World War II, a buck sergeant, and was promoted to sergeant major in 1961.
[00:10:01] So let's think about that for a minute. Let's think about that. I mean, we've talked,
[00:10:07] we've definitely talked about Normandy, we've definitely talked about Market Garden,
[00:10:11] he jumped into both those and jumped into Sicily and Soleno, and jumped into combat in the Korean
[00:10:19] War. Unbelievable. Going back to the book, the sergeant major was a noble shit guy who believed,
[00:10:29] as I did, in tough training, tough discipline, and tough physical conditioning. To this day,
[00:10:35] there are veterans of the battalion who are convinced that God may look like sergeant major
[00:10:40] basal plumbly, but he isn't nearly as tough as the sergeant major on sins, small or large.
[00:10:47] privately, I thanked my lucky stars that I had inherited such a treasure.
[00:10:53] I told Sergeant Major Pondley that he had unrestricted access to me at any time
[00:10:58] on any subject he wished to raise. After the ceremony, the company commanders and the
[00:11:04] battalion staff got to look at their new boss and award on my standards. They were fairly simple.
[00:11:10] Only first place trophies will be displayed, accepted, or presented in this battalion.
[00:11:15] Second place in our line of work is defeat of the unit on the battlefield and death for the
[00:11:21] individual in combat. No fat troops or officers, decision making will be decentralized,
[00:11:28] push the power down. It pays off in wartime. Loyalty flows down as well. I check up on everything.
[00:11:37] I am available day or night to talk with any officer of this battalion. Finally, the sergeant
[00:11:42] major works for only for me and takes orders only for me. He is my right hand man.
[00:11:49] So he's set in the stage. Pretty interesting. Not only first place trophies.
[00:11:58] Second place. No. Not happening here. Back to the book, the officers of my new battalion were
[00:12:06] the usual great army mix of men who had come from their jobs. Come to their jobs from West
[00:12:11] Point, ROTC, Officer Candidate School, and Military Schools like the Citadel. Most of the young
[00:12:16] second-loop tettids had come through OCS and college ROTC programs. There were three rifle
[00:12:22] companies in the battalion, Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie companies. Each had full strength,
[00:12:27] supposed to have six officers in a 164-in-listed men. They were my maneuver elements.
[00:12:32] Each rifle company had three rifle platoons, plus one platoon of
[00:12:36] three 81-millimeter mortar squads for fire support. Each rifle platoon in turn had three rifle
[00:12:43] squads, plus a weapon squad of two M60 machine guns for fire support. So there's the breakdown
[00:12:49] right there. They also had another combat support company Delta Company,
[00:12:55] which had a recon platoon, a mortar platoon and an anti-tank platoon. And they converted the
[00:13:00] unneeded anti-tank platoon to the machine gun platoon for for duty in Vietnam because there was no
[00:13:04] enemy tanks going up against. So that's what the battalion was looking like.
[00:13:10] Going back to the book during the during those first 14 months and now he's going to talk about
[00:13:15] their work up a little bit. How they got ready for combat back to the book. During those 14
[00:13:20] months before we sailed for Vietnam, we spent most of the time in the field practicing assault
[00:13:24] landings from helicopters and the incredibly complex coordination of artillery,
[00:13:28] tactical air support and aerial rocket artillery with the all-important flow of helicopters into
[00:13:35] an out-of-the-battle zone. Commanders had to learn to see terrain differently, to add a constant
[00:13:41] scan for landing zones, which are called LZs and pick-up zones, PZs, to all the other features they
[00:13:48] had to keep in mind. We practiced rapid loading and unloading of men and material to reduce the
[00:13:54] helicopters window of vulnerability. Total flexibility was the watchword and planning and attitude.
[00:14:01] There was one bit of sobering reality that I insisted be introduced at every level in this training.
[00:14:06] We would declare a platoon commander dead and let his sergeant take over and carry out the mission.
[00:14:11] Or declare a sergeant dead and have one of his PFCs take over running the squad. We were training
[00:14:16] for war and leaders are killed in battle. I wanted every man trained for and capable of taking over
[00:14:24] the job of the man above him. So they're working a whole new gig here. They never, no one had
[00:14:30] really done this before riding everyone's going into combat on helicopters. And obviously helicopters
[00:14:35] give you great amount of maneuverability. You can be up vertically and take off and travel a
[00:14:40] great distance and set down anywhere or not anywhere just about anywhere. You can set down
[00:14:44] in a lot of places. You can't set down anywhere. Especially in the jungle. You've got trees and
[00:14:48] all kinds of obstacles and then you've got enemy on top of that. And helicopters are
[00:14:53] pretty vulnerable flying machines. And so this idea of what they were practicing was this massive
[00:15:00] movement move all the troops into the combat zone very quickly and the enemy doesn't expect you
[00:15:04] that you can just shell up there. So that's what they're practicing over and over again.
[00:15:08] And clearly a Korean war veteran like how more was he knows that leaders can get killed in combat.
[00:15:17] And so he's sometimes killing the leaders and training and that's a tradition we still had.
[00:15:22] We did that all the time when I was running training the seal teams. The minute the leaders
[00:15:25] started to get a grip on things, it was like, okay, you're dead. Next man's got to step up.
[00:15:30] And sometimes that would just wreck a platoon or task unit. The leader dies if they're a good
[00:15:35] leader and no one is used to stepping up. It'd be problematic. But sometimes it would actually
[00:15:41] be beneficial because you get some guy that's a micromanager killing and then watch everything run
[00:15:45] smoothly and you come back and you go dude. You better back off a little bit because this guy's
[00:15:49] running a better show than you are. And it's really clear. So sometimes we teach guys lessons that way.
[00:15:57] Back to the book. Unfortunately my battalion and every other in the division now began to
[00:16:01] suffer the consequences of President Johnson's refusal to declare a state of emergency and extend
[00:16:07] the active duty tours of draftees and reserve officers. The order came down. Any soldier who had less
[00:16:15] of less, who had 60 days or less left to serve on his enlistment as of the date of deployment
[00:16:21] August 16 must be left behind. We were sick at heart. We were being shipped off to war sadly
[00:16:28] under strength and crippled by the loss of almost 100 troopers in my battalion alone. The very
[00:16:34] men who would be the most useful in combat, those who had trained the longest in the new techniques
[00:16:39] of helicopter warfare were by this order taken away from us. It made no sense then. It makes no
[00:16:46] sense now. So again I talked about the strategic kind of implications that these guys felt and this
[00:16:52] is one of them and obviously I'm jumping through the book. They talked more about the work up and
[00:16:56] what they did to prepare. But now he's getting this point where President Johnson doesn't declare
[00:17:00] a state of emergency and keep these guys in. That's a political decision obviously. What
[00:17:08] it wears an impact? Sure, it impacts the guys on the front line. That's where it impacts.
[00:17:14] Now like I said this book is written not only by Lieutenant General Howmore,
[00:17:21] it's how he retired in this book. I'll refer to him as Lieutenant Colonel or sometimes I guess I'm just
[00:17:27] a disrespectful and call him Howmore. I don't mean it disrespectfully. But anyways, how more
[00:17:34] wrote the book. But he also wrote the book along with another guy named Joe Galaway. And you know
[00:17:40] what a ghost writer is. Yeah, ghost writer. Well this is so ghost writer writes a person's book
[00:17:46] but no one's supposed to know it. And then there's people that write the book but they get credit for it.
[00:17:50] And you might think that's a situation here looking at the title because you've got Lieutenant General
[00:17:55] Howerald More retired and Joseph L. Galaway. Like, you know, it doesn't say any service thing. Well
[00:18:04] in this particular case that could give you an absolutely wrong impression because Joe Galaway
[00:18:09] was a reporter, a combat reporter who was obviously he was very courageous and
[00:18:16] and basically got after it for lack of a better word. So I'll go in where they introduce him a
[00:18:23] little bit back to the book. UPI reporter Joe Galaway, a 23-year-old native of Refugeeotexus,
[00:18:30] marched with us. When he hooked up with us, he carried on a shoulder an M-16 rifle, which the
[00:18:35] special forces commander made your Charles Beckworth had handed him when the fight was over.
[00:18:42] Galaway told Beckworth that strictly speaking under the Geneva Convention, he was a civilian
[00:18:47] non-combatant, Beckwith's response, no such thing in these mountains. Boy, take that rifle.
[00:18:54] So if you know anything about Charles Beckworth major Charlie Beckworth, it's the guy that created
[00:19:00] Delta Force, complete badass warrior and he was a special forces commander in Vietnam and was one of
[00:19:08] the first people that apparently Galaway worked with and Galaway said, you know, you better arm
[00:19:11] yourself. So here's Galaway talking. Galaway remembers. My first time out with Halmore's first
[00:19:20] Italian seventh cavalry was a hellish walk into the sun to a remote Montagarde mountain village.
[00:19:26] We got into a patch of brush and wait a minute vine so thick and phony that every step had to be
[00:19:31] carved out with machetes. We covered maybe 300 yards in four hours and forwarded a fast running
[00:19:37] chest deep mountain stream just as darkness fell then huddled in our poncho's wet and freezing
[00:19:43] all night long. At first light I pinched off a small piece of C4 plastic explosive from the
[00:19:48] emergency supply in my pack and used it to boil up a canteen of water for coffee.
[00:19:54] If you lit C4 very carefully, you could be drinking hot coffee in maybe 30 seconds if you were careless,
[00:20:00] it blew off your arm. Over a first cigarette I watched Moore's men.
[00:20:06] First they shaved. Shaved up here I was amazed. Then the Colonel himself blonde,
[00:20:13] jet-jod and very intense. A son of barge-down Kentucky and West Point walked by on this morning
[00:20:21] rounds with the sergeant made with sergeant major plumbly. Moore looked to me over and said,
[00:20:26] we all shave in my outfit. Reporters included. My steaming coffee water went for a wash and a shave
[00:20:33] and I gained a measure of respect for the man. Daily discipline and all things.
[00:20:41] You know that's another thing that I failed to mention but it's very clear when you read the book
[00:20:44] is this is 1965 and the war had not escalated at all and it wasn't the meat grinder that it
[00:20:52] turned into. So these guys you know in their workup they knew that they were going to fight but
[00:20:59] they didn't know it wasn't the Vietnam that we think of now where there's a lot of casualties happening.
[00:21:05] It hadn't gotten there yet. It's a matter of fact this battle is really the first one where
[00:21:10] that where you start seeing very significant American casualties. The guy that's in charge over
[00:21:21] how over how Moore is a guy named Colonel Brown and he shows up going back to the book
[00:21:26] not long after Colonel Brown flew in check on the situation with Alpha Company then called me
[00:21:31] aside. How I'm moving your battalion west tomorrow morning. He said unfolding his map. Here is your
[00:21:38] area of operations north of Chu Pong and the I-Drain Valley. Your missions the same one you have now
[00:21:45] find and kill the enemy. He rapidly outlined the scope of operations and the resources he could spare
[00:21:51] 16 UH 1D Hueies. So that's a Huey helicopter. It's the most Iconic helicopter
[00:22:02] probably of any military and certainly of Vietnam the Huey helicopter is is completely iconic.
[00:22:11] 16 Hueies to move my troops to 105 Hours or batteries within range to support us and at least two days
[00:22:17] on the ground patrolling. He added that Alpha Company of the 229th Helicopter Battalion would provide
[00:22:25] the helicopters. The 229th A company commander Major Bruce Crandell was on his way now.
[00:22:33] One more thing how in that area be sure your companies are close enough for mutual support.
[00:22:38] So the reason I highlighted that a lot of times people have a tendency in combat situations,
[00:22:49] especially when planning to get too far apart from each other. Then I would see this all the time.
[00:22:53] And what happens is it seems to make sense because you cover more ground or you have better angles
[00:22:59] and it seems like a good idea like hey we'll just split up and you can take care of your guys and
[00:23:03] I'll take care of my guys but you always need to stay within a position where you can mutually support each
[00:23:09] other. Where if we get a trouble we can cover move that's what it is. You want to be able to cover to
[00:23:13] move cover move. So the minute you're out of sight, out of line of sight, out of radio,
[00:23:20] out of the out of a distance where your weapons can be used to support your alone.
[00:23:26] That's the thing. You get away from line of sight, radio contact,
[00:23:30] the distance that weapons can be shot effectively from the other unit that you're out there with.
[00:23:36] Now you are alone. So when you're planning, make sure and he's saying in that area,
[00:23:43] I always use that rule. As often as possible, are there times where you can flex that rule a little
[00:23:52] bit? Of course there are situations you can get into and you might be a better tactical call,
[00:23:56] but always keep in mind what you're doing and what you're sacrificing when you can no longer
[00:24:02] mutually support the other units out you're out with and they can't mutually support you.
[00:24:08] You're alone. So he knows this is going to be a little bit of a hot area.
[00:24:14] At least he expects it. Going back to the book, how ready was my batalion for combat?
[00:24:19] We had never maneuvered in combat as an entire battalion. Although all three rifle companies
[00:24:23] had been minor scrapes. So they've been in Vietnam for a while. They've been in a little bit of
[00:24:27] contact, but nothing too major. And like you just said, none of them had been.
[00:24:32] Then they've been out as a group as a battalion. Back to the book, most of them
[00:24:35] had never seen an enemy soldier dead or alive. We had killed fewer than 10 black pajama gorillas
[00:24:42] in the get acquainted patrols and small operations since our arrival. The four line companies had
[00:24:48] 20 of their authorized 23 officers. But the enlisted ranks have been badly whittled down by
[00:24:55] expiring enlistments, malaria cases and requirements for base camp guards and workers
[00:25:02] back in an K. Alpha Company had 115 men, 49 fewer than authorized. Bravo company at 114 men was
[00:25:10] 50 short. Charlie Company had 106 men down by 58. And the weapons company Delta had only
[00:25:17] 76 men 42 fewer than authorized. Headquarters company was also under strength and I had been forced
[00:25:24] to draw down further by sending men out to fill crucial medical and communication
[00:25:29] as vacancies in the line companies. I didn't like being short-handed, but things had been
[00:25:36] no different in the Korean War than somehow we made do. You just suck it up and do it.
[00:25:41] And we would do the same way in the eye-drying. The officers and NCOs would do what they could
[00:25:50] to make up the slack just as we had done in Korea. So my point of reading that, these guys are
[00:25:55] heavily undermined. Suppose to have 150 people in the have 105 or whatever. And there's nothing
[00:26:04] to do about it. And it's also interesting in worth noting that he has a headquarters company, so you
[00:26:09] got the battalion commander and he's got a group of guys that do weapons for him and also communications.
[00:26:15] And he's pushed those guys out. So instead of keeping those guys and making him his own team,
[00:26:21] all fat and happy, note that he makes his team thin and gives as much as he can to the forces
[00:26:27] that are out in the field. So another good note on leadership. Now they're getting ready to roll in
[00:26:34] and we will talk about he's kind of going through the plan a little bit. Here we go back to the book.
[00:26:43] I would personally land on the first helicopter piloted by Bruce Crandell and Bruce Crandell's
[00:26:46] the commander of the helicopters that are flying them in. That would permit me a final low-level
[00:26:51] look at the landing zone and surrounding terrain. And with Crandell and the front seat and me and
[00:26:55] the back, we could work out on the spot any last minute diversion to an alternate lander's
[00:27:00] landing zone if necessary and fix any other problems with the lift. In the American Civil War,
[00:27:06] it was a matter of principle that a good officer rode his horse as little as possible.
[00:27:11] There were sound reasons for this. If you are riding and your soldiers are marching,
[00:27:15] how can you judge how tired they are, how thirsty, how heavy their packs weigh on their shoulders.
[00:27:22] I applied the same philosophy in Vietnam where every battalion commander had his own command and
[00:27:27] control helicopter. Some commanders used their helicopter as their personal mount.
[00:27:33] I never believed in that. You had to get on the ground with your troops to see and hear what was
[00:27:37] happening. You have to soak up firsthand information for your instincts to operate accurately.
[00:27:44] Besides, it's too easy to be crisp, cool, and detached at 1500 feet. Too easy to man the
[00:27:50] impossible of your troops. Too easy to make mistakes that are fatal only to those souls far below in the mud,
[00:27:57] the blood and confusion. This is something we talk about all the time from the leadership perspective.
[00:28:02] You cannot be, it's the dichotomy of detachment. It does pay and there are certain times where you can tell
[00:28:11] in these situations, if you're in the command helicopter that's up above the fighting,
[00:28:15] well, you're defacto. You are detached from the situation. You can see what's happening and you have
[00:28:22] you have a good view of what's going on. But even though you have a good view, you're also missing
[00:28:28] a bunch. You're missing what it's like down there. You're missing what the men are seeing. You're
[00:28:31] missing what it looks like to them. You're missing the communication breakdowns that are happening
[00:28:35] down there. So you have to find that balance between these two and he clearly is aware of that.
[00:28:47] Preparing for this and he's got a book called Street Without Joy by a guy named Bernard
[00:28:55] Fall and it's a book about Vietnam. It's a book about the tragedy that the French troops went through
[00:29:05] fighting the Vietnamese and he says that he took one lesson away from that book and this is the lesson.
[00:29:11] Death is the price you pay for underestimating this tenacious enemy. So he was aware and like
[00:29:19] General Mattis said, you know, not too long ago they were talking about General Mattis and how
[00:29:23] coming read so many books and he says because I get to see I get to learn and this is a classic case.
[00:29:28] He knew he read books about the French that had fought the Vietnamese what ten years earlier,
[00:29:34] eleven years earlier and that made him more prepared. Now talking a little bit like I said,
[00:29:41] there's a there's great information in here about the enemy and like I said, they went and
[00:29:47] interviewed and got reports from the enemy and here we go a little bit about the enemy.
[00:29:54] Back to the book the soldiers commanded by Brigadier General Chu, Chuui, Man had been training
[00:30:00] for more than 18 months. When they joined the people's army each recruit was issued two
[00:30:05] khaki shirts, two pairs of khaki trousers, a sewing kit and a pair of Ho Chi Minh sandals cut from
[00:30:11] used tire trucks. Those uniforms were expected in the last five years. Basic training lasted 13
[00:30:19] weeks, six days, a week, six a.m. to nine, 15 p.m. The instructors emphasized weapons and tactics,
[00:30:25] the house of warfare while the political commissars had time had time set aside each day to
[00:30:31] lecture on the wise of this war. The recruits were reminded constantly that their fathers had beaten
[00:30:37] the French colonialists. Now it was their duty to defeat the American imperialists. They were
[00:30:43] imbued with Ho Chi Minh's dictum. Nothing is more precious than freedom and independence.
[00:30:49] After basic training, some were selected for six months of NCO school and would emerge as new
[00:30:54] corporals for the rest advanced infantry training included familiarization with all weapons,
[00:30:59] the use of explosive ambush tactics, reconnaissance tactics, adjusting mortar fire and patrol
[00:31:05] tactics. In June of 1964, man soldiers moved up into the mountains of North Vietnam to rain similar
[00:31:13] to that in western highlands of South Vietnam. Here, physical conditioning was emphasized. They
[00:31:18] scaled steep slopes while wearing rock sacks loaded with 50 to 60 pounds of rocks. Their advance
[00:31:24] training now also focused on the art of camouflage. When the time came for them to begin the
[00:31:30] arduous two-month journey down the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Louss, General Man's Regiment broke down
[00:31:36] into battalions for security purposes, each moving separately at least three days ahead of the
[00:31:41] next. Each soldier carried four pounds of rice, seven days rations, plus another eight pounds of
[00:31:47] foodstuffs that were expected to last in the whole trip. Two pounds of salt, two pounds of wheat
[00:31:52] flour, and four pounds of salt pork. One man in every squad carried the aluminum cook pot that would
[00:31:59] that the squad's rice would be boiled in. Each man also carried 50 anti-malaria pills,
[00:32:05] one for each day on the trail, and a hundred vitamin B1 tabs to be taken at the rate of three per week.
[00:32:12] Despite the pills virtually every man who walked the trail contracting malaria and on average
[00:32:17] three or four soldiers of each one hundred and sixty man company would die on the journey.
[00:32:23] Malaria, diarrhea, accidents, poisonous snakes and American error raids took their toll.
[00:32:30] Man's soldiers marched nine miles each day, the distance between rest camps where they spent each night.
[00:32:37] Every day, every fourth day they stayed in camp, taking the day off to rest up,
[00:32:42] wash their clothes, and tend to minor medical problems. So this is a legit enemy. We're looking at
[00:32:49] legit enemy organized, well trained, hard, tough, well led, and ready. And you can't ever,
[00:33:02] you know, this is one of the biggest problems with fighting a counterinsurgency, as you're going
[00:33:06] against someone that's fighting on their own turf. And that is just, you can't, how do you overcome
[00:33:10] that advantage? Well, you overcome that advantage with firepower and with some technology,
[00:33:14] but that is a hard advantage to overcome. Yeah. And here's a quote from General Anne,
[00:33:23] when you landed there, you landed right in the middle of three of our battalions of the 66th
[00:33:28] regimen, our service, our reserve force. It was the strongest we had. At full strength, the battalions
[00:33:36] each had about 450 men. Also, there was a headquarters battalion. The regimen's total strength
[00:33:42] was about 1600 men. So there, kind of by chance, set up on the same spot where these guys are
[00:33:52] going to go in, which is LZX-ray, landing zone X-ray. And here, they're flying into the LZX-ray.
[00:34:04] Captain John Herron, whose Bravo Company troops filled the helicopter recalls it was a cool,
[00:34:09] it was a misty cool morning with some low-hanging fog when we lifted off. But shortly after take off,
[00:34:15] we broke into the clear and you could see the 105 artillery pounding the areas around the LZX
[00:34:20] we headed in. Vietnam, even in war, was scenic, with green jungle, heavy forested mountains,
[00:34:27] and wild looking rivers, crisscrossing the terrain. Now the helicopters of the aerial rocket artillery
[00:34:37] slam the perimeter with rockets, grenades, and machine gun fire using 24 of the 48, 2.7 inch rockets
[00:34:45] they carried. So it's the same thing that we've heard before it's cover move, right? As you come into
[00:34:51] a landing zone, like they did in D-Day, what do you do first? You bomb the crap out of it. You hit it
[00:34:57] with naval gunfire and they're doing the same thing here. They're prepping the landing zone by
[00:35:01] dropping a bunch of 105 ha, into the surrounding area around the landing zone, and then the
[00:35:08] helicopters, once it's too close, and the, and the hawitzers have to turn off, then the helicopter
[00:35:13] starts shooting, and they do their best to clear the area around the landing zone. That's what's going on.
[00:35:17] Back to the book, The People's Army Commander on the battlefield, then senior Lieutenant Colonel
[00:35:25] Nguyen, who on, says, when you drop troops into X-ray, I was on Tupong Mountain. We had a very
[00:35:32] strong position and a strong mobile command group. We were ready. We were ready. Had prepared for you
[00:35:39] and expected you to come. The only question was when? The trees and bush limited our view of the
[00:35:46] helicopters landing, but we had an observation post on top of the mountain, and they reported to us
[00:35:51] when you drop troops and when you move them. So, man, you know, I talk about all the time about
[00:35:59] having the high ground, well, these guys are landing in a valley, and they're surrounded by
[00:36:04] high ground. So, you're at your tactical disadvantage there. Right as soon as, just about as soon
[00:36:12] as I hit the ground, they're there for a little while and they get a prisoner. The Americans
[00:36:17] get a prisoner, and here's there's a translator, and he translates the prisoners' words, and here's
[00:36:24] what the prisoner says. Well, here's what the translator says. He says there are three battalions
[00:36:29] on the mountain who want very much to kill Americans, but have not been able to find any.
[00:36:35] Now, you take that with a grain of salt, because it's coming from a prisoner, but it's not nothing.
[00:36:40] I'll put it to you that way. It's something. Back to the books, only a few rifle shots,
[00:36:46] rang out in the area where the prisoner had been captured. Sergeant Gilrod's men were in contact.
[00:36:52] It was now 1215 PM. We had to move fast if we were going to survive, had to get off the landing
[00:36:57] zone, and hit them before they could hit us. Only if we brought the enemy to battle deep in the
[00:37:02] trees and brush, could we stand even a slim chance of holding onto the clearing and getting the rest
[00:37:07] to the battalion landed. That football field size clearing was our lifeline and our supply line.
[00:37:13] If the enemy closed away to the helicopters, all of us would die in this place. So that's one of the
[00:37:20] one of the hard things about helicopter warfare, especially in Vietnam, well, actually anywhere,
[00:37:25] is you get great. You can go along distance and get in there, but then once you're there,
[00:37:30] if the helicopters can't come get you out, or they can't resupply you're in real
[00:37:34] problem, you're back to the word that I said earlier, you're alone. Back to the book, even as the
[00:37:40] first shots rang out, I was raiding you and heron to saddle up the rest of the rubble company.
[00:37:45] The rest of his his rubble company met a move out fast toward the mountain to develop the situation.
[00:37:50] Turning to Nendal and he's again, there's all these characters. I mean, there's all the
[00:37:56] company commanders, the platoon commanders, the platoon leaders, the platoon sergeants, there's the
[00:38:00] ground troops, there's all these characters. And the book doesn't outstanding job of
[00:38:05] detailing who all these individuals were. What they're back on was where they came from,
[00:38:10] and I just don't, we can't do that right now, but that's why you buy the book and you read the book.
[00:38:16] But this guy in Adal is one of the company commanders. So here we go, turning to Adal.
[00:38:22] I told him that the original plan was out the window that his alpha company should immediately
[00:38:26] take over L.C. security and get ready to move up on Bravo Company's left when Charlie
[00:38:31] went enough of Charlie Company to arrive down the next lift to assume the job of securing and clearing.
[00:38:35] So classic, you hit the ground and now all the sudden the plan is out the window, right?
[00:38:43] Out the window. We're going with our standard operating procedures, which is hey, we're going to
[00:38:46] move a company here, you're going to set up perimeter security and go. Back to the book and the
[00:38:51] small cops, the other two platoon, platoons of Bravo Company men had open sea rash and cans,
[00:38:59] and we're grabbing a bite when they heard the first shots in the brush. The older sergeants
[00:39:04] glance at one another and nodded. Eat fast, they told the men, and get ready to move.
[00:39:09] The battle of L.C. X-ray had just begun.
[00:39:12] And it doesn't take long to begin going back to the book says sergeant Gil Reeth,
[00:39:22] we were virtually pinned to the ground and taken casualties. Lieutenant Dennis Deal remembers that moment.
[00:39:28] Devny's platoon was taking moderate fire. We could all hear it through the foliage and I heard
[00:39:33] it crackling on my radio. Owls and some sort of trouble, the firing increased in volume and
[00:39:39] intensity. Then I saw my first wounded trooper, probably the first American wounded in L.C. X-ray.
[00:39:46] He was shot in the neck or mouth or both was still carrying his rifle, was ambulatory,
[00:39:51] and appeared stunned at what had happened to him. When he asked where to go, I put my arm around
[00:39:56] and pointed to where I'd last seen the batide commander. So it's immediately on and you of course
[00:40:03] it is because there's three battalions of Vietnamese soldiers there. And this is how more talking
[00:40:19] back to the book, the military historian S.L.A. Marshall wrote that at the beginning of a battle,
[00:40:23] units fractionalized, groping between the antagonist takes place and the battle takes form from
[00:40:28] all of this. Marshall had it right. That is precisely what was happening up in the scrub,
[00:40:33] brush a rub above landing zone X-ray this day. And no other single event would have greater impact
[00:40:41] on the shape of this battle than what Lieutenant Henry Herrick was in the process of doing.
[00:40:46] Herrick charged right past Lieutenant Devny's men, swung his platoon to the right in
[00:40:51] hop pursuit of a few fleeting enemy soldiers and disappeared from sight into the bush.
[00:40:57] Says Sergeant Ernie Savage of Herrick's orders, he made a bad decision. And we knew at the time it
[00:41:04] was a bad decision. We were breaking contact with the rest of the company. We were supposed to
[00:41:08] come up on the flank of First Platoon. In fact, we were moving away from them. We lost contact
[00:41:14] with everyone, everybody. So again, this is what I just talked about. And it's, you're going to
[00:41:21] see throughout this book, all these principles that we talk about all the time that that we taught
[00:41:28] and that we live through. You can see that these types of things happen. And here's a classic
[00:41:32] thing I was just talking about. Like when you get out of distance from your supporting elements,
[00:41:37] you're now alone. And that's a bad situation to be in. Back to the book. Now, John Herron was
[00:41:47] up on my radio reporting that his men were under heavy attack by at least two enemy companies. And that
[00:41:52] his second platoon was in danger of being surrounded and caught off from the rest of the company.
[00:41:56] Even as he spoke, more than rocket rounds hit in the clearing where I stood. My worst case scenario
[00:42:02] had just come to pass. We were now in a heavy contact before all my battalion was on the ground.
[00:42:08] And now I had to deal with a cutoff platoon. My response was an angry shit.
[00:42:13] Captain John Herron's estimate that his bravo company men were trying to deal with two enemy
[00:42:19] companies with slightly off. One full enemy battalion, more than 500 determined enemy soldiers,
[00:42:25] was boiling down the mountain toward Herrick's trap second platoon and maneuvering near Aldivini's
[00:42:30] pin down first platoon. Again, here's something that I failed to talk about with helicopter warfare.
[00:42:37] So he's got a battalion of 500 guys, 550 guys. You can't fit all those guys on 16 helicopters.
[00:42:47] So you've got to do multiple laps. And that's what he's he's worried. He was worried about it going in.
[00:42:54] That, hey, I want to get my whole battalion on the ground before the fighting starts.
[00:42:57] He's already failed to do that. Or maybe he hasn't failed to do it, but it didn't happen.
[00:43:02] Back to the book, I was tempted to join the dolls or Edwards men, but resisted the temptation.
[00:43:10] I had no business getting involved with the actions of only one company. I might get pin down
[00:43:15] and simply become another rifleman. My duty was to lead rifleman. So there's a,
[00:43:21] you know, we talked about the detachment that he said, hey, look, I'm not going to be up in the helicopter,
[00:43:25] but right now he's saying, look, I'm not going to be in the helicopter overhead at 1500 feet,
[00:43:29] but I'm not going to be sitting in a platoon as a rifleman slugging it out with the enemy. That's not
[00:43:34] the right place to be either. You have to lead in, in order to lead, you have to take a step back. You have to
[00:43:38] detach. And he does that to the best of his ability. And here we go back to the book. Just now,
[00:43:44] the snaps and cracks are the rounds passing nearby took on a distinctly different sound, like a swarm of
[00:43:48] bees around our heads. I was on the radio trying to hear a transmission over the noise when I felt the
[00:43:54] firm hand on my right soldier shoulder. It was sergeant major plumblies. He shouted over the
[00:44:00] racket of the firefight. Sir, if you don't find some cover, you're going to go down. And if you go
[00:44:04] down, we all go down. Plumbly was right as always. Anyone waving, yelling, hand signaling, or talking
[00:44:12] on the radio was instantly targeted by the enemy. These guys were quick to spot and shoot leaders,
[00:44:18] radio operators, and medics. I'd never fret about being wounded in combat in Korea or here,
[00:44:25] but plumbly brought me up short. The game was just beginning. This was no time for me to go out of it.
[00:44:31] The sergeant major pointed to a large termite hill. Six or seven feet high, located in some
[00:44:36] trees in the waist between the two open areas of the landing zone. It was about 30 yards away.
[00:44:42] And three of us turned and ran toward it with bullets kicking up red dirt around our feet. And
[00:44:47] the bees still buzzing around our heads. That termite hill, the size of a large automobile,
[00:44:53] would become the battalion command post. The aid station, the supply point, the collection area
[00:44:58] for enemy prisoners, weapons and equipment, and the place where our dead were brought.
[00:45:05] Casualties were now beginning to pile up. As we drop behind that termite hill, I fleetingly
[00:45:09] thought about an illustration, an illustrious predecessor of mine in the seventh cavalry,
[00:45:15] Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer. And his final stay, stand in the valley of
[00:45:21] Little Binghorn in Montana 89 years earlier. I was determined that history would not repeat
[00:45:28] itself in the valley of the eyedrain. We were a tight well trained and disciplined fighting force,
[00:45:34] and we had one thing George Custer did not have. Fire support.
[00:45:39] Fire support plays. It's beyond critical. I mean, they would not have been able to do this
[00:45:48] without fire support. And that's the one thing that's going to save them. I mean,
[00:45:54] obviously the discipline, obviously the training, obviously the bravery, but the fire support is
[00:46:00] a gift. Back to the book. Sergeant Steve Hanson was behind into the right of Lieutenant
[00:46:08] Tafft. He says, we moved at a trot across the open grass toward the tree line and heard fire up
[00:46:15] on the finger to the west where we were headed. My radio operator friend, specialist for
[00:46:21] Ray Turner, Ray Tanner, and I cross the streambed. Captain Nodal's party and the two other
[00:46:28] Patoons were off to the right. Lieutenant Tafft was well-forward as we crossed over into the trees.
[00:46:33] Sergeant first class Lorenzo Nathan Ray Turner and I were close maybe 10 yards behind.
[00:46:42] We were moving fast, specialist. Speck four, Pete Winter was near me.
[00:46:48] We ran into a wall of lead. Every man in the lead squad was shot.
[00:46:54] From the time we got the order to move to the time where men were dying was only five minutes.
[00:46:59] The enemy were very close to us and overran some of our dead. The firing was heavy.
[00:47:06] Sergeant Nathan pulled us back out of the woods of the streambed.
[00:47:13] Bob Hayes in Bob Tafft's radio operator recalls Lieutenant Tafft got out in front of me. I was off to his left.
[00:47:19] He had his radio handset in his left hand, connected to the radio on my back with that
[00:47:25] fluxed flexible rubber wire. It got tight and I pulled back on the lieutenant and hollered.
[00:47:30] We're getting off line. He glanced back at me, turned back to his front and took four more steps.
[00:47:36] Then he fired two shots at something I couldn't see what. Then he dropped face down on the ground.
[00:47:42] Lieutenant Tafft was hit. I didn't realize how bad until I rolled him over.
[00:47:47] He was shot in the throat and the rounded ricochet down and come out his left side.
[00:47:51] He was dead and it was difficult to roll him over. Even though he was a slightly built man.
[00:47:58] Captain Nadal says the enemy on the mountain started moving down rapidly in somewhat
[00:48:03] uncoordinated attacks. They streamed down the hill and down the creek bed. The enemy knew the area.
[00:48:09] They came down the best cover route. The third platoon was heavily engaged in the volume of firing
[00:48:16] reached a crescendo on my left at this time I lost contact with Tafft platoon. In the center of
[00:48:23] that fury, Bob Hayes and struggled and rolled his dead platoon leader over. He was gone and there
[00:48:30] was nothing we could do. The first thing I thought of was what they taught me. Never let the enemy
[00:48:36] get his hands on a map or the signals codebook. I got those from Lieutenant Tafft and was kneeling
[00:48:41] over to try and pull his body back. That's when my radio was hit and the shrapnel from the radio
[00:48:46] hit me in the back of the head. It didn't really hurt all the sun. I was just laying face down
[00:48:51] on the ground next to Lieutenant Tafft. I felt something running down my tree,
[00:48:56] my down my neck reached back and came out with a handful of blood. Carmen Miscelli was on Hayes
[00:49:03] and right. We knew what had happened. The word passed fast. They got Lieutenant Tafft. Again,
[00:49:11] we're talking within minutes of these guys arriving. This is going completely sideways.
[00:49:19] Back to the book, Captain Nadal out of radio contact with Tafft platoon moved toward the
[00:49:24] furious firing on his left flank to find out what was happening. Nadal says,
[00:49:29] my radio operator Sergeant Jack E. Gell, the company communications chief who had volunteered
[00:49:35] to carry one of my two radios ran with me out from out of the creek bed and into the open area
[00:49:41] toward Tafft's position. We ran into Sergeant Nathan and I asked him what was happening.
[00:49:46] He said the platoon had been attacked on the left flank. The left squad had taken a number of
[00:49:51] casualties and had pulled back out of the creek bed, refusing their left enemy, their left
[00:49:55] flank to the enemy. Nathan said Tafft had been hit and was left in the creek bed. That made
[00:50:01] me angry. We had been taught never to leave any wounded or dead on the battlefield. Sergeant Gell and I
[00:50:07] crawled forward of our lines to that creek bed where the enemy were to find Tafft. We came
[00:50:12] under grenade attack from the west side of the creek bed but had some cover from a few trees.
[00:50:17] We located Tafft dead. While bringing him back, we saw another soldier who had been left behind.
[00:50:22] After leaving Tafft's body with his platoon, Gell and I went back again and we picked up the other man.
[00:50:36] Back to the book, Dennis Deal remembers. We moved online for about a hundred or 150 yards
[00:50:43] before the volume of firing forced us to stop. We were taking too many casualties.
[00:50:49] I radioed Harix Platoon and said, I think we're getting close to you. Shoot one round off, wait
[00:50:55] to the count of three and shoot two more. The radio man or whoever was on the radio did that.
[00:51:00] So we had a pretty good fix on where he was. We got up and started the assault again. We went
[00:51:05] about 10 yards and the whole thing just blew in our faces. Blue up in our faces. The enemy
[00:51:11] had infiltrated between Harix Platoon and us and now we're starting to come behind us. So that
[00:51:17] Platoon that had gotten separated, this element with Dennis Deal was going out to try and get
[00:51:23] contact with them and bring them back inside the perimeter. They meet. They they they're assaulting.
[00:51:27] They go all hundred yards, 150 yards and they start getting mowed down. And now they realize that
[00:51:34] in between they've got bad guys in between where Harix Platoon is and where the rest of the
[00:51:39] perimeter is set up. Because they do have kind of a rough perimeter on this landing zone and the
[00:51:44] landing zone. Apologize for not explaining this. I mean in order to bring in Helicopters in the
[00:51:48] junk, we need some open space. So the landing zone, LZX, as an area where there's not much of
[00:51:52] foliage for whatever reason. And so that's where they've kind of consolidated their forces. Only
[00:51:57] because they can't go anywhere else. They hit the ground. They start getting shot at. So now they're
[00:52:01] setting up a what's called a perimeter. And obviously Harix Platoon is outside the perimeter.
[00:52:07] Back to the book. Lieutenant Deal adds that he and another he and the other two
[00:52:13] platoon leaders now began planning yet another attempt to break through and rescue Harix men.
[00:52:18] Leaders were running back and forth coordinating when all of a sudden firing began.
[00:52:23] The lull dissipated quickly. It was at this time my weapon squad leader Sergeant Curry,
[00:52:28] the chief was killed. His last words were those bastards are trying to get me. He was caught
[00:52:35] rolling around on the ground. Later on as my men were carrying him back, I had them put him down
[00:52:42] and turn his face toward me and looked at him. I could not conceive of the chief being dead.
[00:52:50] Staff Sergeant Wilbur Curry, Jr. of Buffalo, New York, was 35 years old.
[00:52:55] Haric and the other two squads were holding precariously to the small,
[00:53:07] no near the bottom of the finger. Savage, so a kid named Savage is out there with Harix Platoon.
[00:53:16] And he ends up running a lot of stuff and you'll find that out. But here he start here in a
[00:53:21] little bit of him right now. Savage teamed up with McKenry Squad, which was pinned to the ground.
[00:53:26] Haric was with that squad. Sergeant Zaylan Squad was off to the left rear. Savage checked on his
[00:53:32] men when he tied up with McKenry. He knew that spec 4 Robert M. Hill M79 Grenadier was no longer
[00:53:41] with them. He got killed in there somewhere. He had his M79 and a 45 caliber pistol and he was firing
[00:53:48] both at the same time. The 23-year-old Hill came from Starkville, Mississippi.
[00:53:56] And here's Sergeant Savage talking, explaining some more, back to the book. The enemy was
[00:54:01] past the machine gun before it ever quit firing. I could hear Sergeant Hurdle down there cursing,
[00:54:06] even over the firefight I heard him. He was famous for that. Motherfucker, son of a bitch,
[00:54:11] I could hear him hollering that down there when they threw, then they threw grenades on him.
[00:54:16] Hurdle 36 was from Washington, DC. Baron bomb 24 was a native of New York City.
[00:54:24] PFC Donald Roddy 22 hailed from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The three of them died in a hail
[00:54:32] of rifle fire and enemy grenades. The enemy down below turns Sergeant Hurdle's M60 around and
[00:54:42] begin using it on the Americans on the knowle. So that causes all kinds of confusion.
[00:54:49] You can tell the difference between different types of weapons by the way they sound when they shoot
[00:54:54] and when someone starts shooting a friendly weapon at you, it's caused a lot of confusion and the M60
[00:55:00] is a beast of a weapon. Belt fed machine gun and it's when I got in the seal teams that was the
[00:55:07] machine gun that we used was the M60 machine gun and it's a devastating weapon. Back to the book,
[00:55:14] the enemy more than 150 strong now attacked the knowle from three sides, north, south and east.
[00:55:21] And soldiers on both sides were falling. Lieutenant Haric ran from Trooper to Trooper trying to get
[00:55:26] a defense organized and enemy volley cut across Haric, his radio operator specialist,
[00:55:32] John R. Stewart and the artillery recon sergeant, sergeant, John T. Brown wounding all three.
[00:55:42] Haric and Brown seriously. Stewart took a single bullet through the leg. Haric radioed
[00:55:47] Bravo Company commander John Harin and told him he had been hit and he was turning command
[00:55:51] of the platoon over to sergeant Carl Palmer. Haric then gave explicit instructions to his men to
[00:55:57] destroy the singles codes, redistribute the ammunition and call an artillery and if possible,
[00:56:02] make a break for it. Harin says, I give Haric all the credit in the world for pulling that
[00:56:08] platoon together so they could make their stand. So should we all? Savage and Zalin
[00:56:16] paint a clear picture of a green, young lieutenant who did a superb job in a hail storm of
[00:56:21] enemy fire. His platoon stopped the very large north Vietnamese unit clearly heading down to
[00:56:27] join the attack on the landing zone. I long ago concluded that the very presence of this platoon
[00:56:33] so far to the northwest confused the enemy commander as to exactly where we were and how far we
[00:56:38] had penetrated in all directions and thus helped us as the battle built. Sergeant Savage recounts
[00:56:46] the final moments of Henry Haric's life. He was lying beside me on the hill and he said,
[00:56:50] if I have to die, I'm glad to give my life for my country. I remember him saying that
[00:56:56] he was going into shock, hidden the hip and in a lot of pain. He didn't live long. He died early
[00:57:03] in the fight next to a little brush pile. Spectre four Charles R. Lowe's 22 of Mobile Ammo,
[00:57:12] Alabama was the new platoon medic. He joined the platoon only a few days earlier. Lieutenant Haric
[00:57:18] was kneeling when hit. He had a bullet wound to the hip. He told me to go help the other wounded.
[00:57:28] Yeah, we have to remember that this guy Haric is like 22, 23-year-old fresh out of
[00:57:37] him. He made that majorly offensive move and pursued and got out of touch. But how more is saying,
[00:57:48] hey, that confused the enemy. Even though it confused the friendly suit, it confused the enemy
[00:57:51] as well. So there's some good that came out of it. Back to the book, Sergeant Ruben Thomas was
[00:58:00] struck by a bullet above his heart that exited under his left arm, bleeding heavily. He grabbed
[00:58:04] a rifle and fought on. The encircled infantrymen of the lost platoon refused to give up.
[00:58:12] Here's what Specialist Dorman said. We were all on the ground now and if you moved, you got hit.
[00:58:18] Our training really showed then we shifted into defense of positions. We had five men killed
[00:58:23] in 25 minutes. Then all of a sudden they tried to mass assault from three directions rushing
[00:58:27] from Bush to Bush laying fire on us. We put our M-16s on full automatic and killed most of them.
[00:58:36] Another guy named Galen, Bung, Bung, Bung, Bungum said, we gathered up all the full magazines.
[00:58:43] We could find and stack them up in front of us. There was no way we could dig a foxhole. The handle
[00:58:47] was blown off my entrenching tool and one of my canteen said, I'll hold blown through it.
[00:58:52] The fire was so heavy that if you tried to raise up to dig you were dead,
[00:58:56] there was death and destruction all around. By now, eight men of the platoon's 29 have been killed
[00:59:03] in action. Another 13 were wounded. The 25 yard wide perimeter was a circle of pain, death,
[00:59:10] fear and raw courage. Medic Charlie Lowe's crawled from men to men throughout the raging firefight
[00:59:18] doing his best to patch the wounded with limited supplies and his medical pack. Although he himself
[00:59:24] was wounded twice, Lowe's never slowed his pace. He would keep all 13 of the wounded alive for the
[00:59:31] for 26 long, harrowing hours. Lowe says, on several occasions, I had to stand or sit up to treat
[00:59:39] the wounded. Each time the VC fired heavily at me. Lowe's used his 45 and M-16 rifle to help
[00:59:48] defend his patients. Getting attacked from three sides, 13 wounded, eight dead, was it nine dead?
[01:00:04] Unbelievable. Back to the book, command had passed. So this is talking about,
[01:00:11] if the leader gets killed, it goes to the next person, that person gets killed, it goes to the next
[01:00:15] person. So here's what's happening in harrowing spatoon, the lost platoon. Back to the book, command
[01:00:21] had passed from Lieutenant Henry Harric to Sergeant Carl Palmer to Sergeant Robert Stokes and each
[01:00:26] in turn died fighting. Now it was the turn of Buck Sergeant Ernie Savage. Sergeant Savage came
[01:00:33] up on the radio, Captain Harrow calls. He said, Harrowing sparring, Stokes were dead to give him
[01:00:39] more artillery and he would direct it in as close as possible. We could never establish the platoon's
[01:00:45] exact position. But Lieutenant Riddle could have just fire on Savage's sensing and he began to do that.
[01:00:53] The extraordinary unyielding resistance that the dozen or so effective fighter fighters were
[01:00:58] putting up plus the artillery barrages that Ernie Savage was bringing down, finally beat off the
[01:01:04] heavy enemy attack. Ernie Savage and his small band honkered down determined to hold their ground
[01:01:11] to the end. Yeah, these guys are calling in to danger. Of course, if we were talking about danger
[01:01:17] close, no, no. Okay, danger close is when you're calling in fire support and you want it to be
[01:01:25] very close to where you are and you on the ground have to take responsibility for it. So in
[01:01:30] other words, the person whether it's artillery, whether it's aircraft, you have to call in, say,
[01:01:35] danger close. Yes, send the rounds. We know it's close. It's we take responsibility for what happens.
[01:01:44] And by the way, going back to the book as this fifth left lift of the day roared out at
[01:01:49] treetop level, the landing zone was suddenly turned red hot. So they haven't even landed
[01:01:53] everyone yet. But this is going on. They haven't even gotten everyone on the landing zone yet.
[01:01:56] Yeah. And here's Krandell talking and again, he's the pilot, unbelievably heroic pilot and
[01:02:05] commanding officer of this helicopter unit. Says Krandell, as I was flaring out to touch down,
[01:02:11] we started receiving heavy, heavy ground fire. I had three dead and three wounded on my board,
[01:02:16] bird. The wounded included my crew chief who had been hit in the throat. When we landed, we saw
[01:02:22] that every bullet had struck the wounded in the head or neck, excellent markmanship by the other side
[01:02:28] and not a happy thought for a helicopter pilot to say the least. So the enemies taken headshots.
[01:02:36] Back to the book with Krandell, flying serpent yellow three were chief war officers,
[01:02:42] Ricardo J. Lambardo 34 of Hartford, Connecticut and Alex S. Pop, jekyll 43 of Seattle, Washington.
[01:02:50] Pop jekyll was a father of nine children during World War II at the age of 20. He had flown
[01:02:55] beat 24s out of England and beat 29s during the post were years until he left the service in
[01:03:01] 1950. Pop jekyll reinlisted in 1952 and had been flying helicopters since 1963.
[01:03:08] Pop jekyll keyed the inner comm and said, I flew 31 missions in B-24s in World War II. And that's
[01:03:15] the closest I've ever come to swallowing my balls. So these landing zones were crazy with these helicopter
[01:03:23] pilots flying in there. It's your gear. You're getting there as fast as you can, but there's
[01:03:30] not much you can do. You bring it in as fast as you can. You try and get loaded up quick and you try and
[01:03:34] take off, but it's not like you're able to shoot back. Even once you're on the ground, your machine
[01:03:38] gunners in the hewies, they can't shoot anymore because you don't know where the friendly troops are.
[01:03:41] So you're a sitting duck, literally a sitting duck. And these pilots going in time and time and
[01:03:47] time again. This goes to the Delta Company commander La Febra. And here's what's going on.
[01:03:55] La Febra, seriously wounded was phasing, was fading fast. I lost a lot of blood. I could see
[01:04:02] people shooting, but I couldn't hear any sounds anymore. I told John here and somebody had to take
[01:04:07] over. I called again Colonel Moore and told him that I was going to turn over the company to
[01:04:11] sergeant Gonzalez. Then the medic arrived to bendage my wound shortly after. I remember someone
[01:04:18] putting me in a poncho and hauling me over to the area of the battalion command post. When I saw
[01:04:22] Lieutenant Aboda again, later we never did talk much about it. It was just too damn close to the real
[01:04:28] thing. Ray La Febra and his handful of Delta Company troopers had unknowingly joined the
[01:04:36] Alpha Company flight at a crucial moment. About 30 North Vietnamese were flanking the dolls men on their
[01:04:41] left and Captain La Febra La Febra's party ran smack into them and killed most of them.
[01:04:47] The dolls men dispatched the rest. Unknown to La Febra, sergeant Gonzalez had been hit in the face by
[01:04:54] an enemy bullet. Gonzalez simply said Roger, when La Febra told him he was now in command. And
[01:04:59] for the next hour and a half he ran Delta Company. Sergeant Gonzalez shot in the face, no factor.
[01:05:10] I'm going to take leadership right now. Going back to the book, it was during all this
[01:05:20] horror that Beck remembers fear coming over him. And here's Beck talking. While Doc Knall was here
[01:05:25] with me working on Russell, fear, real fear hit me. Fear like I had never known before.
[01:05:31] Fear comes and once you recognize it and accept that it passes just as fast as it comes and
[01:05:35] you really don't have to think about it anymore. You just do what you have to do, but you learn
[01:05:40] the real meaning of fear and life and death. For the next two hours I was alone on that gun
[01:05:47] shooting the enemy. Any minute we're shooting at me and bullets were hitting the ground beside
[01:05:51] me and cracking above my head. They were attacking me and I fired as fast as I could in long bursts.
[01:05:57] My M60 was cooking. I had to take a crap and a leak bad so I pulled my pants down while laying
[01:06:03] on my side and did it on my side, taking fire at the time. Now we're going back to how more talking
[01:06:10] here. From my command post at the termite hill, the enemy were clearly visible 100 yards to the
[01:06:16] south. They were damned good soldiers. Used covered concealment to perfection and were deadly shots.
[01:06:23] Most of my dead and wounded soldiers have been shot in the head or upper body. The North Vietnamese
[01:06:28] paid particular attention to radio operators and leaders. They did not appear to have radio
[01:06:32] as themselves. They controlled their men by shouts, waves, pointing, whistles and sometimes bugle calls.
[01:06:39] It was 245 p.m. All three of my rifle companies were heavily engaged. We had lost the use
[01:06:47] of the larger clearing for the helicopter landings. Wounded were streaming into the command post
[01:06:52] aid station. We were in a desperate fix and I was worried that it could become even more desperate.
[01:06:57] By now I believe we were fighting at least two people's armies battalions turns out it was
[01:07:02] three. They were very determined to wipe us out but a major difference between lieutenant colon
[01:07:07] when who on of the people's army of Vietnam and lieutenant Colonel Howmore of the first cavalry
[01:07:13] division was that I had major fire support and he didn't air force captain Bruce Wallace
[01:07:19] and his fellow A1E Skyrader pilots as well as the jet fighter bombers from all three services
[01:07:25] help provide that edge. Flying 50 sordys and close air support that Sunday afternoon.
[01:07:30] He says Wallace the importance of airplanes and a vulgar brawl is to be down among the palm trees
[01:07:37] with the troops putting ordinance on the ground at the exact time in the precise place that the
[01:07:41] ground command needs it. And then so they're in these old school skyraders but then captain
[01:07:50] Wallace is talking about what it was like watching the helicopters back to the book with it. It
[01:07:56] was different with a Huey to watch four eight of them at a time maneuvering up and down and
[01:08:01] laterally and even backwards boggles the fighter pilots mind. Those guys swarmed a target like
[01:08:08] bees over honey. I had to hand it to those Huey guys. They really got down there in the trees with the
[01:08:13] troops. Then this is how Maher howmore talking again the field artillery what we called
[01:08:20] two bartillery to distinguish how it's your folks from the helicopter rocket folks proudly
[01:08:25] calls itself the king of battle. The brave cannon cockers in Elzee falcon went without sleep for
[01:08:31] three days and three nights to help keep us surrounded by a wall of steel. Those two batteries,
[01:08:37] 12 guns fired more than 4,000 rounds of high explosive shells on the first day alone.
[01:08:45] Says Barker on the first afternoon both batteries fired for effect directly on target for
[01:08:50] five straight hours. One of Bruce Krandels Huey's slick pilots captain Paul Winkle touched down at
[01:08:57] Falcon briefly that at first afternoon and was astounded by what he saw. There were stacks of shell
[01:09:02] casings at least 10 feet high and exhausted gun crews. They had fired for effect for three state
[01:09:08] straight hours by then without even pausing to level the bubbles. One tube was burned out to
[01:09:15] be busted hydraulics. That's some shooting. No matter how bad things got for Americans fighting
[01:09:21] for their lives on the x-ray perimeter we could look out to the scrub brush in every direction
[01:09:26] into that seething inferno of exploding artillery shells 2.75 inch rockets,
[01:09:32] napalm canisters 250 in 500 pound bombs and 20 millimeter cannon fire and thank God
[01:09:39] and our lucky stars that we didn't have to walk through that to get to work.
[01:09:46] Yeah, so like I said the the close air support is absolutely or the close air support the
[01:09:52] artillery is absolutely what and that's been happened many on many occasions for for American soldiers,
[01:10:01] sailors, marines, overseas fighting, you know the air force, the navy pilots, the marine
[01:10:08] core fire pilots coming in and actually the guy on the ground controlling these guys is a
[01:10:11] air force pilot as well. So having that air superiority is a wonderful thing.
[01:10:20] Now speaking of the avianers going back to the helicopters chapter nine in this book is called
[01:10:25] brave avianers and it again is sitting ducks coming in as crazy to read about.
[01:10:33] Going back to the book over the 20 months of air mobile training a bond had been welled
[01:10:36] between the infantry and their rides that Huey helicopter pilots and crewmen.
[01:10:41] Now the strength of that bond would be tested in the hottest of fires. If the air bridge failed,
[01:10:46] so the the meaning of the helicopter's ability to get there if the air bridge failed,
[01:10:51] the embattled men of first battalion seventh calf would certainly die in much the same way
[01:10:56] George Armstrong Custard's cavalry men died at Little Big Horn. Cut off surrounded by numerically
[01:11:02] superior forces overrun and butchered to the last man. I asked Bruce Kent, Krandels,
[01:11:09] brave air crews of Alpha Company, the 229th Aviation Battalion for the last measure of
[01:11:15] devotion for service far beyond the limits of duty and mission and they came through as I knew they would.
[01:11:24] And so so again you're basically asking these guys to get shot down every time they fly in and
[01:11:29] this is interesting. Back to the book, this was early in the war and the Metavac commanders had
[01:11:34] decreed that their birds would not land in hot landing zones. In other words, that they would not
[01:11:40] go where they would need it when they were needed the most. Even before I asked Bruce Krandel
[01:11:46] at Art Decided to begin doing everything that had to be done.
[01:11:50] Staying with it, Krandel now dropped as Huey loaded with casualties onto the red dirt strip.
[01:11:59] And this is Krandel talking. When we hit the ground, we were met by medics and infantry troops
[01:12:05] still waiting to be lifted into X-ray. So that's another crazy thing to think about. You're
[01:12:11] unloading wounded men and you're getting on that aircraft that's going to go pick up more
[01:12:16] wounded men but you're going to stay. So the troops that aren't on the ground yet think about what's
[01:12:20] going through their minds. They remove the dead and you want to know what's going through their minds?
[01:12:26] I actually know what's going through their minds. They're going most of those guys are saying,
[01:12:29] get me in there as fast as you can. That's what they're saying. These are their brothers out there.
[01:12:37] Back to the book, they removed the dead and wounded from my bird and this act is engraved in my
[01:12:41] mind deeper than any other experience in my two tours in Vietnam. A huge black and listed man,
[01:12:47] clad only in shorts and boots, hands bigger than dinner plates reaching to my helicopter to pick up
[01:12:52] one of the dead white soldiers. He had tears streaming down his face and he tenderly created
[01:12:58] cradle that dead soldier to his chest as he walked slowly from the aircraft to the medical station.
[01:13:04] I never knew if the man he picked up was his buddy or not. I suspect not. His grief was for a
[01:13:11] fallen comrades and for the agony that violent death brings to those who witnessed it.
[01:13:22] More about the helicopters back to the book, one of the ships brought in Larry Litton,
[01:13:28] who immediately took over command of Delta Company from the wounded sergeant Gonzalez. I told him
[01:13:33] to add the four Delta mortars to consolidate mortar position set up by Captain Edwards and to control
[01:13:40] all seven mortars from a single fire direction center. Principal direction of fire was towards
[01:13:45] Alphan Bravo companies and the mortar man would also have the mission of defending our two
[01:13:50] chopper landing zones from the east. There is no highlight that is even though I talk about
[01:13:54] decentralized command all the time and how more starts off the book talking about how important
[01:13:59] decentralized command is. He's right now in that moment he's centralizing command. He needs to
[01:14:05] get control of all the mortars so that they can use it correctly. Again, that's why it's the
[01:14:10] dichotomy of leadership because you can, there's times when you most of the time you
[01:14:15] decentralized but you can actually decentralize too much. If you don't coordinate the efforts of
[01:14:18] these mortars, you're not going to use them effectively. So he centralizes the command of the
[01:14:21] mortars, brings them all into one location and starts using them effectively. So that's a good note
[01:14:26] for leaders to remember. Now here's another platoon commander, Joe Morm.
[01:14:34] Joe Morm describes the situation in his platoon. My platoon medic was a short timer and did not
[01:14:40] accompany us to Chu Pong. Sergeant first class George McCulley, the platoon sergeant,
[01:14:47] carried the aid kit and we planned to use staff sergeant Thomas Toliver as our medic
[01:14:53] when the need arose. He had been a combat medic during the Korean War and was well qualified.
[01:14:58] Still, we did not have enough medics to go around so we sent down specialist booknight and
[01:15:05] specialist Charles Lowe's a senior medical aid man as platoon medics to Bravo Company.
[01:15:11] Now Calvin booknight still alive but mortally wounded was laid gently on the ground in his blood-filled
[01:15:18] rubber poncho before the medical platoon sergeant. Sergeant first class Keaton, his friend and
[01:15:24] Comrade for the last two years and here's what Keaton says. Booknight wasn't dead. He was shot right
[01:15:31] between the soldiers, right directly between the soldiers. He reached up and took my hand and said,
[01:15:37] serge, I didn't make it. We got an IV started on him and put a pressure bandage over his back wound.
[01:15:45] There was just no hope. We were able to get him on an evac ship but he died.
[01:15:50] The scriptures say that there is no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends.
[01:15:58] This is what Calvin Booknight did in that fire-filled jungle. He sheltered the wounded
[01:16:05] he was treating with his own body, his back to the enemy guns completely vulnerable.
[01:16:24] And except for the predicament of sergeant savage and the cutoff platoon, I was feeling a good deal better about the situation. We had all of our men in.
[01:16:34] Massive firepower had been deployed. A company reinforcements was on the way. Our two chopper lifeline landing
[01:16:40] Zelean was secure. Most of our wounded were either evacuated or awaiting evacuation and we were holding tough.
[01:16:46] I was determined to make one more attempt to rescue sergeant savage and all of us wounded and dead on the slope.
[01:16:54] I ordered Alphan Bravo companies to evacuate their casualties with draw out of close contact with the enemy
[01:17:00] under covering fires and prepared a launch, a coordinated attack supported by heavy prepared to where
[01:17:04] artillery fire to reach the cutoff platoon. I was tortured by the fate of those men and the need to rescue them.
[01:17:12] And chapter 10 is called Fix Bay Annets, which can give you an indication. Back to the book,
[01:17:22] Alphan Bravo companies, the first units to land had now been locked in violent battle for more than two hours.
[01:17:27] It had suffered no small number of casualties, especially among the sergeants and radio operators.
[01:17:32] And it shawed up most of their ammunition. That's another thing we got to remember.
[01:17:37] The movies they never run out of ammunition, right? Unless it makes some theatrical point.
[01:17:41] Yeah, plot point. Right. They also in the movies, there's plenty of water. Oh, they're in the jungle.
[01:17:46] They got plenty of water. These guys don't have water out here.
[01:17:51] No water, no food and now they're running out of ammunition. The two commanders,
[01:17:56] Tony Nadal and John Hare needed time to evacuate their dead and wounded to reorganize and regroup their
[01:18:01] diminished platoons and designate new leaders and to replenish stocks of ammunition and grenades.
[01:18:07] They would have 40 minutes to accomplish this. Then heavy artillery fire would laying down a head of them
[01:18:13] as they kicked off one more attempt to break through the ring of enemy troops and rescue the survivors of Lieutenant Henry
[01:18:19] Herrick's Secondal Tune. Meanwhile, help was on the way.
[01:18:24] Back at third brigade headquarters in the tea plantation, the orders were going out.
[01:18:28] Our sister Battalion, the second Battalion, seventh Cavalism formed that one of its companies Bravo
[01:18:33] was being detached and sent to landing X-ray, landing zone X-ray to reinforce. On arrival in X-ray,
[01:18:40] Bravo Company Second Battalion would come under my operational control for the duration of the fight.
[01:18:44] So there's two battalions. Each Battalion has a number of companies in them and they're going to
[01:18:49] take one of the companies from the other Battalion and let them come in as reinforcements.
[01:18:56] Captain Mairen, Dedurich, Bravo Company, troops won the toss hand down.
[01:19:05] So there was a bunch of different companies there and they were all doing various things.
[01:19:12] But Mairen Dedurich's company was actually, I think they were standing guard and they were
[01:19:19] closest by and so they were the ones that were going and it's probably a good thing because
[01:19:24] this guy, Captain Dedurich is a complete badass as we'll see.
[01:19:30] Bravo Company Second Battalion had good solid professional non-combs and its troops
[01:19:34] served together for some for a long time. It was a good rifle company, I was happy to get it.
[01:19:38] Captain Dedurich was 27 years old, a native born Ukrainian who'd come to the United States with
[01:19:43] his family in 1950. He was an ROTC graduate from St. Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey,
[01:19:50] and was commissioned in July of 1960. He completed Paratrooper in Ranger Training and had served
[01:19:56] tours in Germany and at Fort Pending. Dedurich was married and the father of two children.
[01:20:03] While our reinforcements were saddling up, my Alphan Bravo companies were about to launch
[01:20:08] their second attempt to break through Lieutenant Herrick's trap platoon. John Herron and Tony Nadal
[01:20:13] had pulled their men back to the dry creek bed during the law so they would begin the attack
[01:20:17] from there. Platoon Sergeant Troy Miller remembers the scene. Our morale was very high after the
[01:20:23] first contact before we went off. Before we went after the cutoff platoon, Captain DeDal got us together
[01:20:28] and said, man, we've got an American platoon cutoff out there and we're going after them.
[01:20:32] Their applies were, yeah, and let's go get them and Gary Owen and Gary Owen is the
[01:20:39] it's like the war cry of the cavalry. So and there's a comes from an old song and it's just a
[01:20:46] historical thing and that's why you read the book. You can find out about Gary Owen.
[01:20:51] It's their marching song. Back to the book, Captain Tony Nadal, Alphan Company, was the first
[01:20:59] man out of the creek bed leading first platoon in the assault. He recalls, we moved about 50 yards
[01:21:04] when we ran into the enemy force which had come down the mountain. I presume they were
[01:21:09] preparing to launch their attack about the time we launched ours. The fighting quickly became
[01:21:13] very vicious at close range. We took many casualties. Lieutenant Wayne Johnson, the first platoon
[01:21:20] leader was hit. At least three other squad leaders were also hit. Two of them killed.
[01:21:25] One while going forward in an attempt to rescue one of his soldiers against direct orders.
[01:21:30] Against direct orders, I'm going out to get my buddy.
[01:21:46] Tony Nadal had ordered his men to fix bayonets for the attack.
[01:21:51] Bill Beck firing a burst from his M60 machine gun to his right front was transfixed by
[01:21:56] what he saw just forward. A tall thin sergeant bayonetting of North Vietnamese in the chest.
[01:22:03] It was just like practice against the straw dummies. Forward thrust pull out move on. One, two,
[01:22:10] three. Captain Tony Nadal had four men in his command group as he charged into the brush.
[01:22:14] Two radio operators, sergeant Jack Gal in a 25-year-old native New Yorker and specialist.
[01:22:20] Spect Ford John Clark of Michigan plus the company's artillery forwarded observer lieutenant Timothy M. Blake
[01:22:27] 24 from Charleston, West Virginia and Blake's recon sergeant, sergeant Floyd L. Reed, Jr. 27 years
[01:22:34] old of half Arkansas. As they moved up, Nadal had the radio handset to his ear.
[01:22:42] A burst of any machine gun fire swept across the group. Sergeant Gal was hit and dropped
[01:22:46] without a sound. Nadal kept moving until the long black cord pulled back on him. He was looking
[01:22:56] around to see what was wrong. The same burst that killed Sergeant Gal and also killed Lieutenant
[01:23:00] Blake and struck Sergeant Reed who died shortly thereafter. Sergeant Sam Holman, native
[01:23:08] Sergeant Sam Holman, Jr. a native of Pennsylvania, Naut beside his mortally wounded buddy Jack Gal
[01:23:15] and heard him gasp. Tell my wife I love her. Tony Nadal had no time to mourn Jack Gal.
[01:23:30] A man he greatly respected. Too many other lives were in his hands. On the right flank
[01:23:39] of the Bravo line, Lieutenant Deal was now rolling around on the ground desperately trying to
[01:23:43] dodge a valley of machine gun slugs cutting through the grass all around him.
[01:23:48] Suddenly 25 yards away, Deal saw an American get up and charge forward while everyone around him was
[01:23:53] flat on his belly. Says Deal, I saw him throw a grenade behind a net, hell, an MP is weapon into it.
[01:23:59] Then he fell to his knees. I said to myself, please get up. Don't be hurt. I didn't know who it was.
[01:24:04] I couldn't make out the form. There was so much battlefield haze, dust and smoke.
[01:24:09] It was Lieutenant Joe Marm. He had spotted an enemy machine gun dug into a big termite hill.
[01:24:16] It was chewing up both Bravo company ploons after failing to knock it out with a law rocket
[01:24:22] and a grenade and a throne grenade he decided deal with it directly. He charged through the fire,
[01:24:29] tossed a hand grenade behind the hill and then cleaned up the survivors with his M16 rifle.
[01:24:33] The following day, Lieutenant Alde Vetti found a dead north Vietnamese officer and 11 enemy soldiers
[01:24:41] sprawled behind that termite mound. Says Deal, Joe Marm saved my life and the lives of many others.
[01:24:51] Lieutenant Marm staggered back to his position with a bullet wound to his jaw and neck.
[01:24:55] He joined a growing stream of walking wounded flowing back toward the battalion aid station,
[01:25:00] sergeant Keaton treated Marm's wound and one of Bruce Kondel's crandell's
[01:25:05] queues evacuated him to the rear. Within days Lieutenant Joe Marm was recuperating at Vali
[01:25:12] forj army hospital near his home in Pennsylvania. In December of 1966, Joe Marm reported to the
[01:25:18] Pentagon with a secretary of the army acting on behalf of President Lyndon Johnson, presented him
[01:25:25] with the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for Vali.
[01:25:41] Joe Marm's heroic action unfortunately failed to open the door to the Kondoff Platoon.
[01:25:46] Bravo Company had progressed only about 75 yards, Alpha Company a bit further.
[01:25:51] All through of Nadal's Platoon leaders were now either dead or wounded as were many of his non-combs.
[01:26:00] Worst yet, Alpha Company's first platoon had gotten out ahead of the two other and was heavily
[01:26:05] engaged with perhaps a hundred enemy. Some of the north, some of the Alpha Troopers bypassed the
[01:26:11] enemy in dense brush and those north Vietnamese had opened up on them. Not only were we unable to
[01:26:18] punch through the rescue herics platoon, we were now in danger of having another platoon cut off.
[01:26:26] And again, I apologize. It's one of the things I should have talked about was the way this terrain is set up.
[01:26:31] It's that there's a lot of grass. Like I would say waist high grass, maybe a little bit taller than
[01:26:35] waist high. And if you take cover, you can't say anything. Because you're in grass. If you stand up,
[01:26:42] you get shot. So it's a terrible catch-22. Do you stand up so you can see what's happening and see where
[01:26:50] people are going and see where the enemy is maneuvering? And you might get shot or do you lay down?
[01:26:53] Were you take cover? Do you have a better chance of not getting shot? But you can't see anything.
[01:26:58] Captain Deeric ran up to me and shouted, Gary Owen's sir. Now this is this is awesome. So
[01:27:03] Captain Deeric is the guy that's coming into. He's from 27. He's coming in as reinforcements.
[01:27:09] And like I said, Gary Owen is like their war cry. So here we go. Captain Deeric ran up to me and shout,
[01:27:15] so this is how more it's awoken. He's on this embroiled war zone. Been taken so many casualties.
[01:27:22] And here's what how more it says. Captain Deeric ran up to me and shouted, Gary Owen's sir.
[01:27:26] Captain Deeric and Bravo Company, Second Battalion, 7th Cavry, 120 men strong reporting for duty.
[01:27:33] His eyes sparkled with excitement and the challenge of the situation. I told Deeric to
[01:27:37] assemble his men in a company's 30 yards north west of the command post of act as a
[01:27:41] batalion reserve for the time being. That's awesome. Captain reporting, Gary Owen, Gary Owen's sir.
[01:27:52] Captain Deeric says, the flight continued for another 20 or 30 minutes with neither side
[01:27:57] making headway. It was getting dark and casualties mounted at night. Decided we were not
[01:28:00] going to be able to break through. I called Colonel Moore and asked for permission to pull back.
[01:28:04] That here's what Colonel Moore says with night approaching, there was no real choice. I did not
[01:28:10] want to get into the hours of darkness with my battalion fragmented with the companies in capable
[01:28:14] of mutual support and subject to defeat in detail.
[01:28:21] Word came over the radio and this and so now this is a specialist.
[01:28:27] Gailum bungam who's out there with the lost platoon. Back to the book Word came over the
[01:28:32] radio that we would have to hang on until morning. I could not believe what I heard. I thought
[01:28:37] there was no way we would be able to do that. Others thought the same thing. Clark,
[01:28:42] Kek, asking me, do you think we'll make it? I didn't know. But I said we have to pray and pray hard.
[01:28:50] It was a big question mark in all of our minds. We had to keep our cool and bear down.
[01:28:55] Now we're here from Al Morrigan. I now considered the toll this day's fighting had taken.
[01:29:02] Tonya and Dados, Alpha Company had lost three officers and 31 enlisted men killed or wounded.
[01:29:10] And now reported effective strength of two officers in 84 enlisted.
[01:29:16] John Herron's Bravo Company had lost one officer and 46 enlisted men killed or wounded. It was
[01:29:22] down to four officers and 68 enlisted men with one platoon Herrix trapped outside the perimeter.
[01:29:30] For almost eight hours I had been involved in the minute to minute direction of the battle.
[01:29:35] Now I wanted to personally walk the perimeter and check the preparations for what promised to be
[01:29:40] a tough night and another tough day tomorrow. Just before dark, sergeant made it your plumbly
[01:29:47] and I broke away from the command post and set out to check the perimeter talking with the
[01:29:51] troopers and getting for a feel for the situation on the ground. What concerned me the most
[01:29:56] was the morale of the men. How well the companies were tied in. Their defensive fire plans
[01:30:01] and the situation with ammunition and water supplies. Moral among the men was high. Although
[01:30:08] there was understandable grief over the friends we had lost. The men and I talked.
[01:30:16] The men I talked with realized that we were facing a fierce determined enemy.
[01:30:20] But he failed to break through our lines. They knew the fight was an over. I heard weary soldiers
[01:30:26] saying things like, we'll get them sir and they won't get through us sir. They're fighting spirit
[01:30:32] had not dimmed and they made me proud and humble. In every one of my companies that had landed in
[01:30:40] this place this morning there were 15 to 20 soldiers who had less than two weeks left to go in the army.
[01:30:47] Some of those men now lay dead, wrapped in ponchos near my command post. The rest of them were
[01:30:54] out on that perimeter standing shoulder to shoulder with their buddies ready to continue the fight.
[01:31:10] 37 miles to the northeast. Bruce Crandell and big Ed Freeman friendly shut down their
[01:31:16] hewies at a large, at a huge helicopter pad nicknamed the turkey form outside the wire at Camp Hollow Way.
[01:31:23] They had been flying non-stop since 6 a.m. It was after 10 p.m. when Crandell shut down and tried to get
[01:31:30] out of the aircraft. That is when the day's activities caught up with me. My legs gave out as I stepped
[01:31:37] on the skid and I fell to the ground for the next few minutes I vomited. I was very embarrassed
[01:31:43] and it took some time to regain my composure. Someone slipped me a bottle of Konya into my hand
[01:31:50] and I took a big slug. It was a waste of good booze. It came up as fast as it went down.
[01:31:58] I finally quit shaking and made it to the operations tent to recap the day and plan the next.
[01:32:03] The aviation unit had quite a day. We had not suffered a single fatality and we had not left the mission
[01:32:11] undone. When our infantry brothers called, we hauled the standard for combat assaults with helicopters
[01:32:19] had been set on this day. I wondered about tomorrow. Would it be worse? I wasn't sure I could handle
[01:32:28] another day like today. Then again, I thought about the troops in X-ray. Then the choice was not mine to make.
[01:32:49] Then here's how more talking about the wounded back the book, all of the wounded, all of our
[01:32:55] wounded flown out of X-ray by Krandels Huey's ended up at Charlie Company, 15th medical battalion,
[01:33:01] first cavalry division, which was temporarily set up in tents that camp all the way.
[01:33:06] The executive officer of Charlie Med was Captain George H. Kelling 28 from St. Louis, Missouri.
[01:33:13] Charlie Med's five surgeons tried to stabilize the soldiers coming off the helicopters.
[01:33:18] The treatment we provided says Kelling was designed to keep the blood flowing through the patient
[01:33:22] system until he could be gotten to a hospital, which had the personnel and equipment to perform
[01:33:26] definitive surgery. Charlie Med's doctors tied off perforated blood vessels to stop the hemorrhaging
[01:33:34] and then pumped in whole blood. Kelling recalls that many of the casualties were rapidly bleeding
[01:33:41] to death, so it was a race against time to get blood into the soldier faster than he was losing it.
[01:33:46] Even while the surgeons were trying to tie off bleeders, we threw caution to the wind and gave
[01:33:52] a patient four cut downs, which is an intervenous tube tied into blood vessels, with four
[01:33:57] corpsmen squeezing the blood bags as hard as they could. It was not unusual for the patient to
[01:34:03] shiver and quake and lose body temperature from the rapid transveusion of so much cold blood.
[01:34:10] Both the alternative, what's a let them die? So they're giving blood directly into the veins
[01:34:17] and they've got corpsmen standing there, squeezing the bags of blood to try and keep people alive.
[01:34:29] Back on LZ, here's Sergeant John Stedellan talk and they probed us all night long. We had a few
[01:34:36] men wounded. I'd never been in a situation like that. When they would come at us, they would come
[01:34:41] screaming and we could hear bugles. As darkness fell, savages on the radio with Lieutenant Bill
[01:34:54] Riddle, Herons artillery forward observer, walking the high explosive barrage is all around the
[01:35:01] cut off platoon. All of us were lifted off the ground by the impact and covered with dirt and branches,
[01:35:08] bung them recalls. Savage told them on the radio that was right where we want them. We
[01:35:15] hauled it was too close but I looked back where those first rounds hit and saw three men running
[01:35:20] towards us. We opened up. They must have been crawling up on our position when that artillery
[01:35:25] came in. They would sneak in as close as ten yards or less and many times just stand up to laugh at us.
[01:35:31] We would mow them down. It begins to work on your mind. What are they laughing at? I couldn't believe it.
[01:35:43] The North Vietnamese launched three separate attacks to keep the pressure on the trap
[01:35:47] to Second Platoon during that long night. Each time sending about 50 men against the Americans
[01:35:52] in each time being beaten back by artillery and rifle fire. Savage had seven men on hurt and
[01:35:58] 13 wounded. Nine others were dead. Some of the lost platoon's wounded continued to fight
[01:36:04] including Sergeant Ruben Thompson who had been shot through the chest. The platoon later
[01:36:11] heard still another large enemy force moving down the northern trail toward X-ray and again
[01:36:17] brought artillery fire down on them. This was followed by a flurry of hand grenades back and forth
[01:36:23] at about 4.30 a.m. Within an hour the first lightning eastern sky revealed dozens of
[01:36:28] khaki clad enemy dead scattered all around the little no. The trap platoon had survived the longest
[01:36:35] night any of them would ever know. They checked their ammunition and prepared to receive a dawn attack.
[01:36:44] And here's one of the platoon sergeants talking. Platoon sergeant Robert
[01:36:52] Jemons and Jemison. At first light we sent out a patrol. Staff sergeant Sidney Cohen
[01:37:00] spec for Arthur L. Bronson and three other men were picked to go says Jemison. They saved us from
[01:37:06] being surprised. They spotted the enemy on their way back into an attack position. They came running
[01:37:11] back with Bronson screaming their common serge a lot of them get ready. I told the machine gun
[01:37:16] ers to hold their fire until they were close. PFC Willy Godbolt 24 of Jacksonville Florida was
[01:37:24] hit while firing from his position 20 yards to sergeant Jemonson's right. Jemonson remembers
[01:37:28] Godbolt hollering somebody helped me. I had I'll go get him. Lieutenant Joe Hagan.
[01:37:48] I will go to the Jemonson.
[01:37:52] Jemonson remembers Godbolt was hollering somebody helped me. I yelled I'll go get him. Lieutenant
[01:38:12] Joe Hagan yelled back no I will. Joe Hagan moved out of his position in the fox hole to help
[01:38:20] Godbolt and was shot. This was ten minutes or so from the time the firing first broke out.
[01:38:27] Struggling the back of the head Lieutenant John Lance Jack. Joe Hagan was killed instantly.
[01:38:34] The man he was trying to save PFC Godbolt died of his wounds shortly afterward. The enemy was
[01:38:43] now closed to within 75 yards of Edwards line. They were firing furiously some crouch low and at
[01:38:50] times crawling on their hands and knees. Others no taller than the elephant grass they were passing
[01:38:55] through came on standing up and shooting. They advanced screaming at each other and Edwards men.
[01:39:01] Leaders were blowing whistles and using hand and arm signals. A few were even carrying 82
[01:39:07] millimeter mortar tubes and base plates. This was clearly in no hit and run affair. They'd come to stay.
[01:39:19] And here's Joe Stetland talking. Sergeant John, Sergeant John Stetland. Here's John Stetland talking.
[01:39:26] It seemed like half of Italian hit us all at once. He hit us headlong and he hit us strong.
[01:39:33] I thought we were going to be overrun. When Charlie hit us he had this strange grazing fire.
[01:39:38] He shot right at ground level trying to cut off your legs or if you weren't deep enough in
[01:39:43] your fox hole he shot your head off. When he started firing at us it came like torrents of rain.
[01:39:50] You just couldn't get your head long up long enough to shoot back. You just stuck up your weapon
[01:39:54] pulled the trigger and emptied the magazine. Lieutenant Charlie Hastings are forward.
[01:40:02] Air controller had already swung into action. Sensing disaster Hastings made an immediate
[01:40:08] instinctive decision. I used the code word broken arrow which meant the American unit on the
[01:40:13] in contact was in danger of being overrun and we received all available aircraft and South
[01:40:18] Vietnam for close air support. We had aircraft stacked at a thousand foot intervals from
[01:40:24] 7,000 feet to 35,000 feet each waiting to receive a target and deliver their ordinance.
[01:40:33] And here's how more. By now I was convinced that the enemy was making a primary effort to
[01:40:38] overrun us from the south and southeast and I alerted the reserve platoon for probable commitment
[01:40:42] into Charlie or Delta company sectors. The noise of the battle was unbelievable. Never before or
[01:40:49] since and two wars have I heard anything equal to it. And here's specialist Arthur Viera.
[01:41:00] The gunfire was very loud. We were getting overrun on the right side. Lieutenant Croker came out
[01:41:06] into the open and all this. I thought that was pretty good. He yelled at me. I got up to hear him.
[01:41:12] He holed at me to help cover the left sector. I ran over to him and by the time I got there he was dead.
[01:41:18] He had lasted a half an hour. I knelt beside him took off his dad dog tags and put them in my shirt
[01:41:25] pocket. I went back to firing my M79 and got shot right in the elbow. My M79 went flying and I was
[01:41:31] knocked over and fell backward over the lieutenant. Viera now grabbed his 45 pistol and began firing
[01:41:38] it left handed. And he says, then I got hit in the neck and the bullet went right through.
[01:41:44] I couldn't talk or make a sound. I got up and tried to take charge and we shot with a third round.
[01:41:50] That one blew up my right leg and put me down. It went in my leg above the ankle travel
[01:41:55] up came back out, then went into my groin and ended up in my back close to my spine.
[01:42:02] Just then two stick grenades blew up right over me and tore up both of my legs.
[01:42:08] I reached down with my left hand and touched a grenade fragments on my left leg.
[01:42:12] And it felt like I had touched a red hot poker. My hands just sizzled.
[01:42:25] Unbelievable attack. And I think that script description right there really spells out how
[01:42:32] intense this was. And obviously when you got chrome more saying that this is the loudest thing
[01:42:38] he's ever heard in two wars. That also confirms what we're dealing with here.
[01:42:45] Back to the book at 7.45 a.m. the enemy struck at the left flank of Tonyan Doll's
[01:42:50] Alpha Company at the critical elbow where Alpha and Charlie companies were tied in.
[01:42:55] We are now under attack from three directions. Grazing fire from rifles and machine guns
[01:43:00] shredded the elephant grass and swept over the batained command post in aid station.
[01:43:05] Leaves, bark and small blanchers branches fluttered down on us. Several troopers were wounded in the
[01:43:11] same command post and at least one was killed. My radio operator, spec for Robert P. Olet.
[01:43:20] 23 years old had a of a speckled six-fourter from Madawaska main was hit and slumped over in a
[01:43:28] sprawl unmoving and seemingly dead. I kept the handset to my ear. And here's Joe Galloway the
[01:43:35] reporter. The incoming fire was only a couple of feet off the ground and I was down as flat as I could
[01:43:40] get when I felt the toe of a combat boot in my ribs. I turned my head sideways and looked up there,
[01:43:46] standing tall was sergeant major basal plumbly. Plumbly leaned down and shouted over the noise
[01:43:53] the guns. You can't take no pictures laying down there on the ground, sunny. He was calm, fearless,
[01:43:59] and grinning. I fought. He's right. We're all going to die anyways, so I might as well take mine
[01:44:05] standing up. I got up and began taking a few photographs. Plumbly moved over to the aid station,
[01:44:11] pulled out his 45 chambered around and informed Dr. Carrera and his medics, gentleman, prepared to
[01:44:18] defend yourselves. So Plumbly thought they were getting over onto or at least going to get close.
[01:44:26] You're in the aid station. That's in the center of this whole perimeter. And he's pulling out his 45
[01:44:31] and saying, prepare to defend yourselves. You can't make that up. Specialist,
[01:44:40] willard F. Parish, 24 years old, an unedivable bristow, Oklahoma was an assistant squad leader of
[01:44:47] one of Charlie Company's 81 millimeter mortar squads. Parish was one of the mortar men who had
[01:44:52] been outfitted with his spare machine guns and rifles collected from our casualties and put on the
[01:44:56] Delta Company perimeter. Parish recalls, when we were hit, I remember all the trace around and I
[01:45:03] wondered how even an ant could get through that. Back to a right, we started hearing the guys
[01:45:08] following, they're coming around, they're coming around. I was in a foxhole with a guy from Chicago,
[01:45:14] J. P. F. C. James E. Coleman, and he had an M-16. I had my 45 and his 45 and I had an M-60 machine gun.
[01:45:21] We were set up facing out to the tall grass. I was looking out front and I could see some of
[01:45:27] the grass going down like someone was crawling at it. I hollered, who's out there? Nobody answered
[01:45:31] and I hollered again. No answer. I turned to, I turned to Coleman, burn his ass.
[01:45:37] Coleman said, my rifle's jammed. I looked at him and him at me. Then I looked to the front and they
[01:45:44] were growing out of the weeds. I just remember getting that machine gun from there on out and the
[01:45:49] training takes over and you put your mind somewhere else because I really don't remember what specifically
[01:45:54] I did. I was totally unaware of the time, the conditions. On that M-60 machine gun, according to the
[01:46:01] extracts from his silver star citation, specialist Paris, Paris delivered lethal fire on wave after
[01:46:08] wave of the enemy until he ran out of ammunition. Then standing up under fire with a 45 pistol
[01:46:15] in each hand, Paris fired clip after clip into the enemy who were 20 yards out and he stopped their
[01:46:22] attack. Says Paris, I feel like I didn't do any more than anybody else did up there. I remember a lot
[01:46:30] of noise, a lot of yelling and then all at once it was quiet. The silence out in front of
[01:46:36] Willard Parish was that of this cemetery. More than 100 dead North Vietnamese were later found
[01:46:43] where they had fallen in a semi-circle around his foxhole. 45 in each hand. That's crazy actually.
[01:47:01] I mean, he's going to a whole other level because you can't reload. You can't reload your
[01:47:09] pistol. Maybe he would stand up fire both just dump it, and he'd be able to get back down reloaded
[01:47:16] both. That's after he used all of the 60 ammo. George Fox 25 and Nathaniel Bird 22 were
[01:47:29] slumped across their silent M-60 machine gun surrounded by heaps of empty shell casings in
[01:47:34] empty ammunition cans. They had died together, shoulder to shoulder, sergeant jemisin pays them the
[01:47:41] ultimate compliment of a professional soldier. Bird and Fox did a great job. They kept firing
[01:47:48] that gun and didn't leave it. They stayed on it to the end. So all this close air sports coming
[01:48:05] in this whole time artillery is coming in the whole time and all of a sudden they get a situation
[01:48:09] where they start. They see aircraft coming overhead with jets coming overhead low pass and they're
[01:48:15] heading towards them and they drop some napalm. So here's how more. I yelled at top of my lungs to
[01:48:24] Charlie Hastings. The Air Force FAC call that son of a bitch off column off. Joe Gallaway heard
[01:48:30] Hastings screaming in the radio, pull up, pull up Matt Dylan says, I can still see the canisters
[01:48:35] tumbling toward us. I remember thinking turn your eyes away so you won't be blinded. I put my
[01:48:41] face into a reporter's shoulder to hide my eyes. That was Joe Gallo-Az. I could hear good time
[01:48:48] Charlie Hastings shouting into his radio, pull up the second jet did. The napalm from the first
[01:48:55] hit some people and caught some ammo on fire. Sergeant Major plundly jumped out to put the fire
[01:49:01] put out the fire around the ammunition. I ran out into the LZ to put an air panel out.
[01:49:07] Sergeant Nye says, two of my people. PFC Jimmy D. Nakayama and specialist five
[01:49:17] James Clark were on the other side of me several yards away. Somebody was hollowing and
[01:49:23] Colonel Moore were standing up there hollowing about something about a wingman and I looked
[01:49:28] up. There were two planes coming and one of them had already dropped his napalm and everything seemed
[01:49:33] to go in slow motion. Everything was on fire. Nakayama was all black and Clark was burned and bleeding.
[01:49:41] And here's Joe Gallo-Az. Before I had walked over and talked to the engineer guys in their
[01:49:46] little foxholes, now those same men were dancing in the fire. Their hair burned off in an instant.
[01:49:52] Their clothes were incinerated. One was a massive blisters. The other not quite so bad, but he had
[01:49:58] breathed fire into his lungs. When the flames died down we all ran out into the burning grass.
[01:50:04] Somebody yelled at me to grab the feet of one of the charged soldiers. When I got him,
[01:50:10] the boots crumbled and the flesh came off and I could feel bare bones of his ankles and the palms of my hands.
[01:50:19] We carried him to the aid station. I can still hear their screams.
[01:50:24] Spec 4 Thomas E. Bernlial, a medical man from Bravo Company, second battalion, rushed out
[01:50:33] into the clearing with his kit back to help them napalm victims. Bernlial was shot in the head and
[01:50:38] died within minutes in Lieutenant Ress Corlola's arms. An Oklahoma man, Bernlial had turned 23
[01:50:46] years old just four days before he was killed. Back in the command post,
[01:50:55] our ear forced fact, Charlie Hastings was stunned by all the consequences of the misplaced air strike.
[01:51:03] Hastings were calls after the napalm strike. Colonel Moore looked at me and said something that I never
[01:51:08] forgot. Don't worry about that one, Charlie. Just keep them coming.
[01:51:24] Yeah. I mean, he knows what he's got to do. He's got Hastings that just jered killed some of his own men.
[01:51:30] Wounded some of his own men by fire and he's freaking out. Probably doesn't want to call any more bombs on
[01:51:35] and how more realizes that's what's keeping them alive. Don't worry about that one.
[01:51:44] Just keep them coming. Charlie Company first battalion, seventh cavalry had begun its day
[01:51:55] with five officers in a hundred and six men. My new net had no officers left and only forty-nine
[01:52:01] men on her. A total of forty-two officers and men had been killed and twenty more wounded than two
[01:52:06] and a half hours of vicious hand-to-hand fighting. The bodies of hundreds of slain,
[01:52:12] Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, littered the bloody battleground.
[01:52:22] Speck four, Pat Selic, 24 in a native of Mount Kisco, New York says, I remember one guy had a
[01:52:27] small American flag on the back of his pack. When I saw that, I felt very proud.
[01:52:36] That's something that always stuck with me. This American flag was put on top of a blown-up tree,
[01:52:40] just like a Urujima. Another battle we had won for the United States. That little flag flew
[01:52:48] over landing zone X-ray for the rest of the fight, raising all our spirits.
[01:52:53] And now there's a law in the fighting. And here we go back to the book. During this
[01:53:05] law, the saddest, most painful and hardest duty to endure was collecting our dead and loading
[01:53:10] them on board the helicopters. There were so many that the brigade ordered the big choppers,
[01:53:15] the CH-47 Chinooks. One such helicopter lifted out all 42 of the dead from Charlie Company.
[01:53:24] They came in together, died together, and now left together, wrapped in their green rubber
[01:53:30] ponchos. Speck four, Vincent Cantou, says, we were picking up our dead and placing them in the choppers.
[01:53:40] Some of these guys I had known for two years, you'd I could recognize them only by their
[01:53:44] name tags. Their faces were blown off. It was hard not to get sick. We would look at each other
[01:53:55] and without saying a word, just continue putting our dead on the choppers.
[01:54:00] Now, the Colonel, that's in charge of both battalions. He makes a visit and here we go.
[01:54:26] Mid-morning before Tully arrived, Colonel Tim Brown flew in for a visit.
[01:54:30] Pumly recalls Lieutenant Colonel Moore-Souluded Brown and said, I told you not to come in here.
[01:54:34] It's not safe. Brown picked up his right collar, the bell, and waggled his full Colonel's eagle
[01:54:39] at Moore and said, sorry about that. Dylan and I gave him a situation report. Brown asked whether
[01:54:47] he should stay in X-ray established a small brigade command post and run the show. We recommended
[01:54:52] against that. I knew the area and Bob Tully and I got along just fine. Brown and Ghee agreed.
[01:54:58] Lieutenant Dick Merchants says Colonel Brown had trust and confidence in his commanders.
[01:55:03] I'm aware that some felt he should have landed in X-ray and established a command post. I've never
[01:55:07] accepted that. The first battalion seventh cavalry was probably the finest battalion in Vietnam,
[01:55:14] well-trained, superbly led without standing officers and NCOs throughout the unit.
[01:55:18] Brown would have been out of place in X-ray. Besides there was no room for brigade CP.
[01:55:25] I recall it being rather crowded behind that anheil. So, the reason I put that in there is because
[01:55:30] here's the guy that's, you know, how Moore's boss comes in to check on the scene.
[01:55:37] And some people say, oh, he should have stayed there because it was a bad fight and he, in this
[01:55:42] Dick Merchants said, no, like he shouldn't have stayed there. He did the right thing. He came
[01:55:46] visited and left. And by the way, you want to set up a brigade command post. You need to find
[01:55:52] your own little ant hill because this one's all, this one's a, you know, the size of, yeah, it's full,
[01:55:56] that's the size of a car. We got dead mooned everywhere. And so, but it's, it's the important point
[01:56:03] there for my perspective is, you know, the key thing is that he had trust in confidence in his
[01:56:09] officers. He didn't need to go out there and micromanage them. And I'm not saying you could never do that.
[01:56:16] I'm definitely not saying that's the dichotomy leadership. You know, sometimes you might look out
[01:56:19] there and say, there's something going on. I need to get out there and you need to get in the
[01:56:22] weeds and get this problem handle. I need to come out there and support. In this particular case,
[01:56:26] probably wouldn't have been a good idea. How more had it under control at this point? That's why
[01:56:29] they're landing a, uh, a chinook, which is CH47 giant helicopter, much bigger than a Huey. You
[01:56:35] know, it's a slower and at least on on a prochids slower. So, yeah, there's a time to get out there
[01:56:41] in micromanage and there's a time when you let your teams lead. Okay, going back to the book
[01:56:50] in Myron, D'Durric and Lieutenant Rick Ruskola. So, these are the two guys that came from the second
[01:56:56] Patience 7th Cav. And he just talks about him a little bit and I think it's worse worth mentioning
[01:57:01] Rick Ruskola and, uh, Myron D'Durric, Bravo Company, second Patience had two foreign board officers
[01:57:09] whose accents and gun-hol attitudes went to touch of foreign Legion flare. The Ukrainian D'Durric
[01:57:16] and the Englishman Ruskola was or destined over the next 72 hours to become battle field legends in
[01:57:22] the seventh Cav as much for their style as their fearless leadership under fire. And,
[01:57:27] yeah, it's, it's, it's, you can see what these leaders do and you do get to see it.
[01:57:36] But here's when, when D'Durric, remember he touched down and he was told, hey, go, go set up security
[01:57:41] and here we go. Myron D'Durric and his soldiers had not yet been sorely tested but they soon would be.
[01:57:46] During that role, D'Durric made certain that fields of fire and observation were cleared out
[01:57:50] to be on 200 yards. That good fighting positions were dug. That machine guns were placed in
[01:57:54] positions that assured flanking interlocking fire. That trip flare is an anti-intrusian
[01:57:59] devices were installed as far as 300 yards out. That every man was locked down, loaded down with
[01:58:03] ammunition and that ammo, ammo, resupply points were designated. That all radios were checked and
[01:58:08] double checked. Then D'Durric worked very carefully with his artillery forward observer registering
[01:58:12] pre-plan fires across the front. The officer, the officer Lieutenant William Lund had four batteries
[01:58:19] 24 hours, registered and adjusted on call. So that's, you ever wonder what, uh, what a military leader
[01:58:27] does. That's what he does right there. Diales everything in. And here he's talking about, uh,
[01:58:34] so one of D'Durric's platoon leaders was Rick Rescordla. And here's what he says about Rick Rescordla.
[01:58:39] Rick Rescordla first platoon leader was six months out of OCS at the infantry school at four
[01:58:44] betting. But he had arrived there with a wealth of good training already in under his belt. He had
[01:58:49] served in the British Army in Cyprus and with the Colonial Police in Rhodesia and he knew what
[01:58:54] soldiering was all about. What he did to prepare his position and his men speaks for his professional
[01:59:00] them. So here's what Rick Rescordla did. Rick Rescordla walked a terrain and tried to see it from
[01:59:05] the enemy's point of view. That's critical. What's the enemy thinking? Scrub brush elephant grant,
[01:59:10] grass, ant hills and some ground cover stretched to the front. The ground was not as flat as it
[01:59:15] first appeared but had seams and thick ruts stretching off to the south with a slight incline away from
[01:59:20] his positions. The hasty prone shelters dug by Charlie company first battalion had been dug after
[01:59:26] nightfall under enemy pressure. Rescordla moved his men back 50 yards, which not only shortened
[01:59:32] the sector but meant the enemy would now have to leave the trees and cross 40 yards of mostly
[01:59:36] open area to reach Bravo Company Foxholes. Rescordla recalls, because of our short lines,
[01:59:43] I decreased the number of Foxholes. Three manholes were constructed. The M60 machine guns were said
[01:59:49] on principle directions of fire from which they could switch to final protective grazing fire
[01:59:54] interlocking with each other and with the machine guns on our flanks. Foxholes and parapets were
[02:00:00] built in detail. I tested the holes. Some were so deep the occupants could not even see the
[02:00:06] pair over the parapet. In these cases firing steps were built back up. Two hours before dusk,
[02:00:12] sergeant E S. Bach, A27 and sergeant Thompson organized a booby trap detail. Carefully they rigged
[02:00:19] grenades and trip flares far out on the main avenues of approach. Claimer mines, claimer mines
[02:00:25] would have ice the cake but somewhere they had been lost. A screw up but I felt we were ready to
[02:00:31] tangle with the best of North Vietnamese. And again these guys are luckily there's a wall and they
[02:00:35] have all the time to prepare this and get it all set up. And that's a big difference from what
[02:00:38] happened when these guys hit the LZ and they didn't have any of this stuff. They didn't have any
[02:00:43] the terrain figured out. They didn't have a chance to send it into your personnel. These guys
[02:00:46] are taking advantage of that tactical situation to get up there and make things right. And you know,
[02:00:53] both of those guys, you can see that's what a leader does. That's what a leader does. They make
[02:00:56] sure things are right. They make sure you're ready to win. And you can do that and it will
[02:01:02] that applies to every leader and every position and every industry and every team in the world.
[02:01:08] The leader is stepping up and making sure we are going to be prepared to win. And by the way, this
[02:01:15] Rick Raskorla and this is a little bit of a side note, he ended up working for Morgan Stanley
[02:01:22] as the head of security for Morgan Stanley. And they worked at the Twin D'Hours in New York City.
[02:01:28] That's where Morgan Stanley was. And he felt like they needed to do drills, like they needed to prepare
[02:01:35] and that, like, what happened if the towers came under attack and they ran a bunch of drills.
[02:01:40] And when September 11th came, they ran those drills and got everyone evacuated. And
[02:01:49] Rick Raskorla was last seen on the tenth floor going back up into the building to do a final check
[02:01:56] and make sure that everyone was out and the tower collapsed at 9.59 a.m. and he saved a lot of lives
[02:02:07] that day, not only through his actions on the day of but through his actions in preparing.
[02:02:15] Now, the Vietnamese come, the North Vietnamese come and they bring it. Here we go.
[02:02:24] So the first rush by at least 300 North Vietnamese was beaten off in less than 10 minutes by small
[02:02:30] arms machine gun and artillery fire from the alert and well prepared Bravo Company second battalion troops.
[02:02:34] At 431 a.m. 20 minutes later, they came back to Durex said the intensity of their attack
[02:02:40] increased and I was under the under assault aimed at my three left platoon sectors.
[02:02:47] Screams, shouts and whistles split the night as NVA swept down the mountain straight into the
[02:02:54] smoke clouded killing ground. Now all the mortars of my battalion and Tully's were turned loose.
[02:03:01] Adding their 81 millimeter high explosive shells to the general mayhem.
[02:03:06] Rifleman John Martin, who is in Durex lines says, we kept pouring rifle machine gun fire and artillery
[02:03:13] on them and they broke and ran. I don't think we had any casualties but they were catching hell.
[02:03:20] So now it's totally different story. These guys are dug in. They have all their artillery dialed in.
[02:03:24] They've got their field of fire set up and their attacks come well organized acts with 300 people.
[02:03:29] They don't make it happen. The Vietnamese don't make it happen.
[02:03:34] Yeah. Back to the book. Over on the perimeter of Skorlo's men fought on.
[02:03:41] Our M79 switched to direct fire. Fire delivered to a visible target and lobbed rounds out between
[02:03:47] 75 and 100 yards. Still, the shadowy clumps moved closer. RPGs and machine guns
[02:03:52] crackled as they blasted us from the dark line of ground cover.
[02:03:57] Across open fields they came in a ragged line. The first groups cut down after a few yards.
[02:04:03] A few surge right on sliding down behind their dead comrades for cover. An amazing,
[02:04:09] highly disciplined enemy. A trooper cursed and pleaded in a high pitched voice. God damn it stopped
[02:04:14] the bastards. So here they are. They're attacking and when the North Vietnamese soldiers get hit,
[02:04:20] their buddies are coming up behind them taking cover behind their bodies and continuing to assault.
[02:04:25] So this is an indicator. Like I said, this was early in the war. This is 1965.
[02:04:29] And we didn't know that's determined enemy yet. We didn't understand that yet. And here we're
[02:04:34] seeing it for the first time. This is what this is how determined these guys are. They are going
[02:04:39] to attack. They're going to attack through whatever we put out.
[02:04:48] Here's another situation. Steadolin. This is a Steadolin. Whispered orders to his squad,
[02:04:53] telling men on either side of him to hold their fire not to shoot until the enemy stepped out
[02:04:57] into that open space right in front. Suddenly a flare and a booby trap went off and they were
[02:05:01] there in the grass shooting at us. I took around just above the elbow, nothing really just a
[02:05:06] stitch or two and a piece of tape after the fight. Nobody shot back. Then they stepped into that
[02:05:11] open area. The flares were burning. They were lit up and it was easy. We opened up and picked them off.
[02:05:18] It was a light attack. Then they hit us harder 30 minutes later, blowing bugles, blowing whistles.
[02:05:24] We killed them all. Then some white phosphorus came in about 15 in front of my hole and I lost
[02:05:30] most of my web gear in my shirt. Had about eight burns on one arm. John Steadolin sat there
[02:05:37] under the light of the flares and used the point of his bayonet to quickly dig the still burning
[02:05:42] Willie Pete fragments out of his flesh. White phosphorus is a type of munition that we use and
[02:05:47] it's it's white phosphorus and it hits and blows up and it's on fire. It's a little pieces of
[02:05:52] burning hot metal and he's picking it out of his arm. During the two and a half hours of the attack
[02:06:02] against a deer-exceptor, the rest of the x-ray perimeter had been quiet. Two quiet. Dylan and I discussed
[02:06:07] the possibility of conducting a reconnaissance by fire to check for presence of the enemy elsewhere on
[02:06:12] the line. We had plenty of ammunition and what the hell? The enemy knew where our lines were by now
[02:06:19] as well as I did. We passed the word on the battalion net at precisely 655am every man on the perimeter
[02:06:26] would fire his individual weapon and all machine guns for a full two minutes on full automatic.
[02:06:34] The word was to shoot up trees and hills bushes and high grass forward of the
[02:06:38] fort of and above the American positions. Gunners would shoot anything that worried them.
[02:06:43] By now we had learned to our sorrow that the enemy used the night to put snipers and trees
[02:06:48] ready to do damage at first light. Now was the time to clean up out front. At the stated time,
[02:06:57] our perimeter erupted in ear splitting up roar and immediately a force of 30 to 50 north Vietnamese
[02:07:04] rose from a cover 150 yards forward of Joe's, Saudini's alpha company, second battalion lines
[02:07:12] and began shooting back. The mad minute of firing triggered their attack prematurely.
[02:07:17] Our artillery fire was instantly brought in on them and the attack was beaten off.
[02:07:22] When the shooting stopped, one dead sniper dangled by his rope from a tree in
[02:07:26] Fort of Dyricks left most position. Another dropped dead out of a tree almost immediately
[02:07:31] forward of John Harrow's John Harrow's Bravo Company. First battalion command post.
[02:07:37] A third-veid north Vietnamese sniper was killed in the hour later when he tried to climb down
[02:07:41] from from history and run for it. Sergeant Stedelen's arm speckled with white phosphorus
[02:07:47] burns began hurting him now. I was sent back to the aid station where my arm was bandaged
[02:07:53] and I was waiting to be met a backed out. The more I sat there, the more I realized I couldn't
[02:07:59] in good faith get on a chopper and fly out there and leave those guys behind.
[02:08:03] So I took the sling off my arm and went back out. Somebody asked, where are you going?
[02:08:12] I said, back to my foxhole. Nobody said anything else.
[02:08:21] So obviously these guys now have gained some good fire superiority, the upper hand in the battle.
[02:08:28] Back to the book, Rescoral and his men had been watching the air show
[02:08:35] appreciatively. We gathered for the last sweep. Suddenly a fighter bomber
[02:08:39] plowed down on us from above. We buried our noses in the holes.
[02:08:43] An express train screamed down in the explosion shook the earth. The bomb landed 30 yards from
[02:08:48] our holes. We came up cursing in the dust and debris. The call came to move out.
[02:08:54] Every available trooper, including Colonel Moore, pushed the perimeter out. This time it was
[02:08:59] no contest at all. We killed 27 more enemy and crushed all resistance. I looked over the field,
[02:09:06] littered with enemy dead, sprawled by ones and twos and heaps across a torn gouged land.
[02:09:13] Blood, body fragments torn uniforms shattered weapons, littered the landscape. It was a sobering
[02:09:20] sight. Those men, our enemies, had mothers too. But we had done what we had to do.
[02:09:30] Aside from wanting to make certain that the deeric and his men did a clean, safe job. I had one
[02:09:36] reason for joining the final assault personally. This is Colonel Moore talking and then it goes to
[02:09:42] Rick Raskola. Rick Raskola watched. Colonel Moore and our sector was rushing up the clumps of
[02:09:47] bodies pulling them apart. What the hell is the Colonel doing up there? Sergeant Thompson asked.
[02:09:52] I shook my head. Later we saw him coming back at the head of men carrying ponchos.
[02:09:58] By 10 30 a.m. Colonel Moore had found what he was looking for. Three dead American troops were no longer
[02:10:04] missing in action. Now they were on their way home to their loved ones. By now, late morning,
[02:10:18] Tuesday, November 16th, the personality of landings owned x-ray had changed. What previously had
[02:10:23] been a killing field had become something else. We moved without impunity in places where movement
[02:10:29] had meant death on the hours before. Except for our own artillery and air, there was nothing to be heard.
[02:10:35] It was just too quiet, too sudden, and it made me uneasy. That old principle, nothing was wrong,
[02:10:42] except that nothing was wrong. Where was the enemy? Headed back to Cambodia, still on the mountain,
[02:10:48] preparing to attack again, headed north to the eyedring and its precious water.
[02:10:52] And again, the old question. Where were the enemy 12.7 millimeter heavy anti-aircraft machine guns?
[02:11:00] If the enemy commander brought those weapons to bear on us from the mountain above,
[02:11:03] LZX-ray with three American battalions crowding the clearing would present a beautiful target.
[02:11:09] I told Dylan to step up the harassing artillery fire and to keep the air strikes coming in
[02:11:14] and loslobs above us. I told him I wanted a picture perfect telecopter extraction,
[02:11:19] covered by all the firepower we could bring to bear. So, yeah, tides have turned completely.
[02:11:27] And in fact, they've turned so completely that a chanook, which is the big helicopter, flies in
[02:11:33] with a bunch of photographers and television crews and reporters. And they surround,
[02:11:41] they surround Colonel Moran, here we go, back to the book. The other reporters now
[02:11:46] clustered around me. I told him that this had been a bitterly contested battle.
[02:11:50] That clearly we were up against a brave determined and very tough enemy in the North Vietnamese soldiers.
[02:11:56] But that American firepower, discipline, guts, and will to win had carried the day at LZX-ray.
[02:12:05] Brave American soldiers. And the M16 rifle won a victory year, I said.
[02:12:10] My voice choked and my eyes filled with tears as I told the reporters that many of my men
[02:12:16] who had been killed in this place were only a matter of days away from completing their
[02:12:19] service in the army, but they fought and died bravely. As I stood there, I knew that the telegrams
[02:12:27] that would shatter the hearts and lives of scores of American families were already being drafted.
[02:12:33] Now came the body count. And if you remember we talked about this before everyone was always
[02:12:42] they wanted to talk about the body count Vietnam, even at this early stage.
[02:12:46] He was thinking about that back to the book. Now came the body count. From the beginning of the
[02:12:50] fight, I had known that higher headquarters would eventually want to know what damage we had done to the
[02:12:54] enemy. So after each major action in this battle, hating it, I asked my company commanders for
[02:12:59] their best estimates of enemy killed. The battle raging back and forth over three days and two
[02:13:05] nights, it was anything but orderly. There was no referee to call time out for a body count.
[02:13:10] We did the best we could to keep a realistic count of the enemy dead. In the end, it added up to
[02:13:16] 834 dead by body count with an additional 1,215 estimated killed and wounded by artillery,
[02:13:24] the air attacks and aerial rocket attacks. On my own, I cut the 834 figure back to 634. A personal
[02:13:34] allowance for the confusion in fog of war and let the 11211 estimated stand. We captured an evacuated
[02:13:43] six enemy prisoners. On our side, we had lost 79 Americans killed in action, 121 wounded and none
[02:13:55] missing. And at this point, they get extracted off the battlefield, including Colonel Moore,
[02:14:09] the last man to leave from his battalion. And here we go back to the book. It was a short,
[02:14:16] fast ride to landing zone Falcon. Just five and a half miles east of X-ray. As we landed among the
[02:14:22] artillery pieces, I saw 75 yards away a group of my troops off in the northwestern edge of the
[02:14:27] LZ. Dean Brellis, an NBC news correspondent, was in LZ Falcon that afternoon. He captured the scene
[02:14:39] in his 1967 book, The Face of South Vietnam. And here's what Dean Brellis wrote.
[02:14:47] How Moore was the last man to come out of the battle. It was the biggest battle he had ever fought.
[02:14:53] He was a lieutenant Colonel and he carried himself like a proud man. His sergeant major was at his
[02:15:01] side. It would need a Shakespeare to describe what happened then. But it was something that was love
[02:15:08] and manliness and pride. It was the moment of the brave. How Moore turned and went from group to
[02:15:18] group of his men. And only a few bothered to get up because there was no exclusivity now. No rank.
[02:15:24] And how Moore did not want them to stand and salute. He was saluting them. He talked with them.
[02:15:32] He thanked them. He was not solemn. And he did not bring to his greetings the salutations of
[02:15:38] a political of a politician. There was no poverty of spirit in his handshook, shake, and he shook
[02:15:46] every man's hand. It was a union of men who had met and defeated the enemy, not forever,
[02:15:53] not in a victory that ended the war, but in a victory over their uncertainty.
[02:16:01] When their hour had come, they had done their job. And it was this thought too that
[02:16:07] our more had in his mind. And he said that if they had won no one else's gratitude, they had his.
[02:16:19] And I think that these men, all these men, have our absolute gratitude for fighting for freedom
[02:16:44] for fighting for each other for fighting for us. And actually the story doesn't end there.
[02:16:53] Nor does the book. And we're going to save it for the next podcast, but we're going to hear about
[02:17:01] the story of LZ Albany, which is a few miles to the north. In still inside the I-Drain Valley,
[02:17:07] where second battalion of the seventh cab moved in and fought. And it's... There's so much
[02:17:23] that I didn't cover in this, in this, what I just covered. There's so much I didn't cover.
[02:17:26] I mean, I didn't even cover the loss, but who does eventually get recovered?
[02:17:31] Read the book. I should have left that out. Spoiler alert.
[02:17:33] But there's so much in there. There's so much... So many lessons learned, so much
[02:17:44] action, so much good description. And so many heroes and so much sacrifice. I don't even think
[02:17:52] gratitude. I mean, they gratitude enough. I think we owe them more than just gratitude. We owe them
[02:18:01] our best. We owe them our lives, our best lives every day, every moment.
[02:18:15] And remember this sacrifice and what we owe them is we owe them to live our best lives.
[02:18:29] And I think that's all I've got for tonight. So echo. Yeah, well I decompress over here, maybe you can
[02:18:49] get some input on how to support this podcast, or support yourself if you want to.
[02:18:54] Sure. Yeah, if you want to. So of course, the first way is supporting your joined. So we

[02:19:35] Class of product. I'm going to work out. You're on it. Yeah, it's buzzing on it right now. Yeah.
[02:19:42] So discipline. It's a pre workout. It's a call. You say that's a cool word or that's the name. Both.
[02:19:51] So it's called discipline. Right. So it's pre if technically they call it a pre workout, but we're
[02:19:57] calling it a pre mission. Yeah. Supplement. Well, pre workout would help you with your physical
[02:20:03] activity. Sure. But the discipline has cognitive enhancers in it as well. Right. Because when you're
[02:20:09] on a mission, you just don't need physical strength. You need mental strength. Yeah. So this gives
[02:20:16] you both. Yeah. So if your mission is the workout, boom, there you go. It's a pre workout. If your mission
[02:20:21] is an exam, it's a pre exam. Yes. Supplement. If your mission is a mission,
[02:20:29] well, you're good to go. Oh, pre mission. There you go. Boom. Oh, yeah, get down on. I too can vouch for this.

[02:22:08] spend a lot of time there. So be careful. Also, when you buy this book, we were soldiers once
[02:22:16] and young, but general, how more in jail, galo, you know what I was thinking? I have no idea
[02:22:24] what you're thinking. So, sometimes, you're about to hear that. If you watch the movie a few good
[02:22:29] men, I think it's a bit more. Yes. She plays a jaggle with 10, yes. I see the movie. Her name, the
[02:22:40] character name is Joanne Galoey, but color Jill. So her name is Jill Galoey. I noticed that.
[02:22:48] Anyway, when you buy this book, we were soldiers. There's no layers that they, those are
[02:22:55] interpreted layers. Those are not layers. Those are coincidences. There's a big difference.
[02:23:01] It's a fine line. Charlie, back with that formed up Delta Force.
[02:23:06] Sure. Being in this book, but that's layers. That's layers. Yeah. Yeah. I would come from those layers
[02:23:12] for sure. I don't know. I still feel like Jogalo is layers somewhere. I don't know what if they
[02:23:21] negative. No of this. These stories in me. And they named the good. They could. Negative.
[02:23:29] Maybe maybe not. And if they did, they failed. They failed. Yeah, because
[02:23:33] Jill got it wrong. God after it. Yeah. So, will Jill and Galoey kind of got it? No. Not really.
[02:23:40] Wait, she convinced me. Oh. All right. Either way. I still think it's layers. Either way.

[02:25:35] Jogalo's a store. It's called Jogalo's store. Name it after him. Jogalo's door.com.
[02:25:41] That is where you can get the cool shirts. I think they're cool. And I think it goes beyond just my opinion
[02:25:48] because people have emailed me and been like, hey, these are cool. Because I made sure they're not
[02:25:54] the low quality. People in this study share brand or if they're printing sure they're like,
[02:26:00] hey, let me get the cheap ones. I don't have to spend a lot of money. Play it safe. All this stuff.
[02:26:04] I didn't do that. I got the good ones. Stuff that I would actually wear regardless of what's
[02:26:10] printed like you wearable. They're wearable. That's how I put it. Anyway, that's all I know. They're
[02:26:15] good. I'm wearing one now. Yeah. Correct. Me too. Boom. See, I wouldn't wear it if I didn't want to
[02:26:21] wear it. So anyway, they're very good. That's where you can get the shirts. There's women's stuff on
[02:26:25] there. Also, this rash cards on there for activities such as surfing. You get to warrior kid rash
[02:26:31] card out there. Yeah. Warrior kid rash card should be reached on there. Should be on there.
[02:26:38] I vowed to get them in time to ship for Christmas. So that would be like today. So go on there.
[02:26:46] And that's the my vow. That's the right word. Vow. I vowed to do this. That means you better succeed.
[02:26:55] Yeah. You know, that's my vow. Okay. So anyway, yeah. Yeah. Some rash cards on there for
[02:26:58] just surfing. I'm going to kind of cool activity, cycling, whatever. Anything you want range of
[02:27:03] motion to be maintained 100% and performance be increased by 19%. I think it's up to 21%.
[02:27:10] Yeah. Reverse back from the field. Yeah. Yeah. I think that kind of average because some people
[02:27:15] a little bit more, you know, so those people, they push the average up. I think that's how it works.
[02:27:21] Anyway, cool stuff on there, check it out. Nothing gets something. But if you want something,
[02:27:27] then you get something and it supports podcasts. Good way to support. Who is on there as well?
[02:27:33] Fick or once? They might be running line might have to get some more. It is winter. I get it.
[02:27:39] But they're the thick ones. Like I said, also psychological warfare. What that is, if you don't
[02:27:46] know, I know we all know what it is already. It's been number one and I too well. Might not be number
[02:27:51] one anymore. That's a long story. Anyway, if you don't know what it is, the unlikely event that
[02:27:56] you don't know what it is is what it is. It's an album with tracks, jockel tracks. Each track is designed
[02:28:03] to help you through moments of weakness when you're on your path. When you're on your war path.
[02:28:13] I mean, you know, I don't know. Nonetheless, when you're on the path of discipline,
[02:28:18] right, you're on the program, you're on your campaign against weakness. You hit little. It's not
[02:28:23] just one smoother out and it's not a one straight road either. And it's riddled. Riddled.
[02:28:30] Every day. Probably every minute, literally riddled with distractions. Everyone's in a while.
[02:28:40] You'll hit moments of weakness whether it's a speed bump distraction, lack of energy,
[02:28:47] boredom, repetitiveness, tediousness, tediousness. That's a word or it. That's what psychological
[02:28:57] warfare is for. It's a little spot for those moments. You don't want to wake up early. Every single
[02:29:03] day. Ah, we got the solution for that. Listen to the little track. Jockel, pragmatically telling you.
[02:29:11] I can get over that little moment of weakness. Same thing with wanting to skip the workout for
[02:29:15] the day. That was mine. That was mine. Not anymore. Jack. And yeah, there's a bunch of them for
[02:29:22] all kinds of stuff. Keeping on the diet. It's a good one. That's what psychological warfare is. Very effective.
[02:29:27] 100% affected. That's a bold statement. And you can get Jockel white tea on Amazon,
[02:29:32] which will make you deadlift 8,000 pounds. Factually, confirmed confirmed. You can get some
[02:29:38] books on there. Way the warrior kid. Good Christmas gift. And it's also a good whatever gift. So
[02:29:45] get a kid on the path. Get them on the path. Got so much great feedback on that. Extreme ownership.
[02:29:52] This is for leading at every level in combat in business and in life. Extreme ownership.
[02:29:58] Written meat by meat and my brother, life, babbin. Also from an individual perspective.
[02:30:05] If you want to get yourself on the path, there's no better gift than discipline.
[02:30:08] The discipline equals freedom field manual. Everyone to ask me for workouts. That's where they are.
[02:30:14] Everyone asks me what I eat. That's where it is. Everyone asks me how much I sleep. That's where it is.
[02:30:18] So get that. If you want the audio version, the audio version is not unautable. The audio version
[02:30:24] of discipline equals freedom. Field manual is on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google Play and all those
[02:30:29] other MP3 distributing platforms. There's another master, the master, which is Escelon Front
[02:30:39] leadership conference. There's two of them. Going to be only two of them in 2018. We don't have

[02:31:00] October 17th, and 18th. Coming get it. You can register for those at extreme ownership.com.
[02:31:05] Is are they going to be bigger? Like you only have two now. Now, you sure? Are they going to have more
[02:31:10] people? We have a little bit bigger capacity. Yeah. But we just, we don't have time in this schedule anymore.
[02:31:16] Yeah, I dig it. And we are going to do the roll call for law enforcement, military,
[02:31:23] firefighters. We're going to do that as well. But we haven't locked a date on that one yet.
