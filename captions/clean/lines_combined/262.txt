00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.66 This is Jockel Podcast number 262.
00:00:03.66 --> 00:00:06.68 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.68 --> 00:00:07.68 Good evening echo.
00:00:07.68 --> 00:00:10.52 Good evening.
00:00:10.52 --> 00:00:17.24 The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to Colonel
00:00:17.24 --> 00:00:23.20 Merit A. Edson, United States Marine Corps for service as set forth in the following
00:00:23.20 --> 00:00:32.000 excitation for extraordinary heroism and conspicuous interpetity above and beyond the call of
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.76 duty as commanding officer of the first Marine radar battalion with parachute battalion
00:00:37.76 --> 00:00:44.56 attached during action against enemy Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands on the night
00:00:44.56 --> 00:00:50.24 of 1314 September 1942.
00:00:50.24 --> 00:00:56.40 After the airfield on Guadalcanal had been seized from the enemy on August 8th, Colonel
00:00:56.40 --> 00:01:04.36 Edson with a force of 800 men was assigned to the occupation and defense of a ridge dominating
00:01:04.36 --> 00:01:07.84 the jungle on either side of the airport.
00:01:07.84 --> 00:01:14.56 Facing a formidable Japanese attack which augmented by infiltration had crashed through
00:01:14.56 --> 00:01:20.80 our front lines, he by skillful handling of his troops successfully withdrew his forward
00:01:20.80 --> 00:01:25.76 units to a reserve line with minimum casualties.
00:01:25.76 --> 00:01:32.40 When the enemy in a subsequent series of violent assaults engaged our force in desperate
00:01:32.40 --> 00:01:40.88 hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, rifles, pistols, grenades and knives, Colonel Edson, although
00:01:40.88 --> 00:01:46.64 continuously exposed a hostile fire throughout the night, personally directed defense of the
00:01:46.64 --> 00:01:52.56 reserve position against a fanatical foe of greatly superior numbers.
00:01:52.56 --> 00:02:00.24 By his astute leadership and gallant devotion to duty he enabled his men despite severe losses
00:02:00.24 --> 00:02:08.72 to cling tenetiously to their position on the vital ridge thereby retaining command not only
00:02:08.72 --> 00:02:16.88 of the Guadalcanal airfield but also of the first divisions entire offensive installations
00:02:16.88 --> 00:02:20.16 in the surrounding area.
00:02:20.16 --> 00:02:27.76 Signed Franklin D. Roosevelt.
00:02:27.76 --> 00:02:36.48 That is an example of the level of heroism that was required to achieve victory in the battle
00:02:36.48 --> 00:02:48.16 of Guadalcanal which lasted from August 7, 1942 until February 9, 1943, six months and two days
00:02:49.12 --> 00:02:54.80 of just absolutely brutal and savage fighting.
00:02:55.60 --> 00:02:59.60 Then we've covered some of that in several books on the podcast
00:02:59.60 --> 00:03:09.68 and we even had Dean Ladd on the podcast who received a battlefield commission on Guadalcanal
00:03:09.68 --> 00:03:19.52 and went on to fight at Tarua and Sipan and Tinian but I recently received a copy of a book
00:03:19.52 --> 00:03:24.64 from a podcast listener by the name of David. I guess I'm a little cautious about giving out full
00:03:24.64 --> 00:03:32.32 names because I don't know the background so a guy named David, he sent me a book was actually
00:03:32.32 --> 00:03:42.08 not a book technically. It's a Fleet Marine Force reference publication FMFRP 12
00:03:42.08 --> 00:03:48.48 110. The title is Fighting on Guadalcanal so thank you David for sending that to me.
00:03:48.48 --> 00:03:55.84 And the book is filled with all kinds of layers. One of them being the metal of honor citation
00:03:55.84 --> 00:04:02.000 that I started with, there's an additional layer in this which is that this
00:04:02.80 --> 00:04:07.92 Fleet Marine Force reference publication was put together by a guy named Colonel Red Reader
00:04:09.36 --> 00:04:15.20 who was West Point Class of 1926 who led the 12th Infantry Regiment
00:04:15.20 --> 00:04:22.000 who in the D-Day and he eventually was wounded and he received the Distinguished Service
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.44 Gross and Silver Star in the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star in the Purple Heart and he
00:04:25.44 --> 00:04:31.36 retired in 1946 and then he worked as the athletic director back at West Point and eventually
00:04:31.36 --> 00:04:37.76 became an author and he wrote a bunch of books including a memoir which is called Born At Reveley.
00:04:37.76 --> 00:04:46.40 So I'm sure at some point we will cover that book on this podcast but for tonight I wanted to
00:04:47.84 --> 00:04:52.56 I wanted to go to this book which is what I'm guessing is sort of the beginning of Colonel
00:04:52.56 --> 00:04:59.84 Reader's writing career was to put together this this manual fighting on Guadalcanal
00:04:59.84 --> 00:05:08.48 and it's the direct lessons learned and let's get right into it. So here's the forward.
00:05:11.04 --> 00:05:14.48 To secure the point of view of the fighting man in the Salmanol Islands,
00:05:15.44 --> 00:05:21.84 Lieutenant Colonel Russell P. Reader Jr., who I just mentioned, of the operations division
00:05:21.84 --> 00:05:26.000 of the award department general staff was designated as my personal representative.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.76 He reported to Major General Vandagriff, United States Marine Corps and Major General Patch
00:05:31.76 --> 00:05:38.000 U.S. Army on Guadalcanal and discussed with many officers and soldiers their experiences in
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.88 jungle fighting against the Japanese. The stories of these men as told the Colonel Reader have been
00:05:42.88 --> 00:05:48.96 printed for your information. The American Marines and Do Bois show us that the
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:57.12 job is no Superman. He is a tricky, vicious and fanatical fighter but they are beating him day after day.
00:05:58.64 --> 00:06:05.28 There's is a priceless record of the gallantry and resourcefulness of the American fighting man at his
00:06:05.28 --> 00:06:11.20 best. Soldiers and officers alike should read these notes and seek to apply their lessons.
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:19.76 We must cash in on the experience which these and other brave men have paid for in blood.
00:06:22.48 --> 00:06:28.000 So that's what this book is. There's an opening note from Major General Vandagriff,
00:06:30.08 --> 00:06:36.16 just a very famous commanding general, the first Marine division. He says,
00:06:36.16 --> 00:06:41.92 I desire to thank General Marshall for the message which he has just sent me. I passed this
00:06:41.92 --> 00:06:47.68 message of congratulations onto my men. My message to the troops of General Marshall's in training
00:06:47.68 --> 00:06:53.36 for this type of warfare is to go back to the tactics of the French and Indian days.
00:06:54.72 --> 00:07:02.32 This is not meant for she'slessly. Study their tactics and fit in our modern weapons and you
00:07:02.32 --> 00:07:09.68 have a solution. I refer to the tactics and leadership of the days of Rogers Rangers.
00:07:10.88 --> 00:07:14.80 So there you go. Already we're talking about we got to make some things a little bit different.
00:07:14.80 --> 00:07:20.72 We got to look at the way we used to fight. If you think about that attitude of fighting
00:07:20.72 --> 00:07:25.20 with the Rangers, with Rogers Rangers, with the French and Indian War, this is the big difference between
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.84 the way the British wanted to fight which was we're all lined up. We're standing in
00:07:31.84 --> 00:07:36.24 ranks and we're going to shoot and then you shoot and then we shoot back at you. We're not doing that.
00:07:36.24 --> 00:07:40.48 No, that's how we won the Revolutionary War because we're going to fight a different way.
00:07:41.60 --> 00:07:47.20 The early form of maneuver warfare. So that's what this book is. This is a bunch of just short
00:07:48.80 --> 00:07:56.88 anecdotal quotes from a bunch of Marines mainly about what their experiences are on Guadalcanal,
00:07:56.88 --> 00:08:02.48 bunch of great information. Gunnery, Sergeant H. L. Beard's Lee.
00:08:04.32 --> 00:08:10.72 Company G5th Marines. I've been in the Marine 16 years and I've been in three expeditions to
00:08:10.72 --> 00:08:16.48 China and five engagements since I've been in the Solomon's. I will say that this 1942 model
00:08:16.48 --> 00:08:24.08 recruit we are getting can drink more water than six old timers. We have to stress water discipline
00:08:24.08 --> 00:08:29.04 all the time. They don't seem to realize what real water discipline is. We have too many
00:08:29.04 --> 00:08:34.80 NCOs in the Marines who are Nambe, Pambi and beat around the bush. Our NCOs are gradually
00:08:34.80 --> 00:08:41.84 toughening up and are seeing reasons why they must meet their responsibilities. Respectfully speaking,
00:08:41.84 --> 00:08:49.68 sir, I think that when officers make an NCO, they should go over in their minds what kind of NCO
00:08:49.68 --> 00:08:57.12 will he make in the field? Water discipline. There's something you don't hear very often. You
00:08:57.12 --> 00:09:01.60 got to go deeper into the field before you start talking about water discipline because guess what?
00:09:01.60 --> 00:09:06.64 And I don't know when that, when did the word hydrate? Do you remember pre the word hydrate?
00:09:06.64 --> 00:09:10.88 Yes, right. Hydrate was a new thing. It's a relatively new thing.
00:09:11.60 --> 00:09:16.80 Yeah, that's for the expression hydrate. I think even the idea. Because when I was a kid,
00:09:16.80 --> 00:09:22.40 we didn't, we didn't have the word hydrate because hydrate seems like a proactive thing.
00:09:22.40 --> 00:09:26.40 Yeah, like like like you're going to get ahead of the curve. Right? You're going to,
00:09:26.40 --> 00:09:29.60 you need to hydrate. You need to stay hydrated. Hydrate or die?
00:09:30.32 --> 00:09:34.40 Sir, I never heard that. Hydrate or die? That was like that was the camel back. Remember
00:09:34.40 --> 00:09:38.96 camel back? That was their expression. Hydrate or die? Like the camel backs, the things with
00:09:38.96 --> 00:09:42.88 a little hose coming over. Oh, that was the camel back the brand. The camel back the brand. Have
00:09:42.88 --> 00:09:49.20 the expression hydrate or die? That's cool. So, but let's face it. What we're saying here,
00:09:49.76 --> 00:09:54.64 and you never hear this, he said, don't hydrate. If you hydrate too much, you're going to
00:09:54.64 --> 00:09:59.04 actually going to run out of water. You need to get water discipline. That's a totally different
00:09:59.04 --> 00:10:04.56 mindset. Now, I will tell you when you're going out on a long, like a desert patrol,
00:10:04.56 --> 00:10:10.24 where you're not going to get a water resupply, you've got to have some water discipline. Let me
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:14.96 explain to you. You know, these guys fought when they needed to have water discipline big time,
00:10:14.96 --> 00:10:21.36 but it's interesting to hear that attitude. You don't hear that anymore. Everyone's all about
00:10:21.36 --> 00:10:27.12 hydrate. Hydrate. It's a different mindset. I'm sure maybe, so maybe there's some doctors that
00:10:27.12 --> 00:10:32.24 will approach us and kind of give us the real deal on that. Yeah, well, it makes sense because
00:10:32.24 --> 00:10:36.000 you have two different scenarios. Like, yeah, if you have the luxury to be able to just hydrate
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.76 at will, then oh, yeah, hydrate, or die for sure. But, you know, water discipline, that I did kind of
00:10:41.76 --> 00:10:48.56 seems like it would be under maybe two specific circumstances where you don't have a lot of water
00:10:48.56 --> 00:10:57.12 just to go. Have you ever not had water? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like, where you were almost going to go down.
00:10:57.12 --> 00:11:03.92 Don't trade up dehydrated. What happened? Well, it was heat exhaustion. Okay. So the thing is I had
00:11:03.92 --> 00:11:08.000 water, but I didn't get enough water. Okay. What was the scenario? Football.
00:11:09.52 --> 00:11:13.04 But, so there was like a gatorade thing on the surface. So yeah, automatic. Yeah.
00:11:14.08 --> 00:11:21.12 Yes, sir. I was not out of water. Okay. My body was up like low on water. Can you get,
00:11:21.12 --> 00:11:25.84 can you get heat, whatever, heat, yeah, you can't. You can get a heat catch, we want your drinking water.
00:11:25.84 --> 00:11:30.56 Yes, sir. So, so you were saying you were kind of close to that. I guess that's different from just
00:11:30.56 --> 00:11:36.32 straight up dehydration. Well, dehydration is like levels, right? Like you're, they say you're 2%.
00:11:36.32 --> 00:11:42.64 dehydrated if you're even thirsty for water. That's what they say. But, so yeah, you know, it depends
00:11:42.64 --> 00:11:46.48 on what you're trying to say. You know, we're going to get a seat back on this one. I can tell you.
00:11:46.48 --> 00:11:51.28 Yeah. Makes sense. But, you know, in the field, you're talking about a situation where there's
00:11:51.28 --> 00:11:55.76 two elements where limited water, you don't have unlimited water because you can't carry unlimited
00:11:55.76 --> 00:12:01.76 water. And then you still have to function in the event of unlimited water or not on it. And let's
00:12:01.76 --> 00:12:08.16 face it. So, there's been, there's been a lot of times where I was thirsty, right, in the field.
00:12:08.16 --> 00:12:15.12 There's one time where I was in like a little bit of a bad situation where I could start feeling
00:12:15.12 --> 00:12:23.12 like, oh, this could be a problem. And we were out, we were out in the Ozarks in Arkansas doing this
00:12:23.12 --> 00:12:30.72 big land warfare problem. And we were expecting, you know, we had planned that, you know, there
00:12:30.72 --> 00:12:34.96 were streams. You could see on the map. And there was a couple. So, we, you know, okay, we'll be able
00:12:34.96 --> 00:12:39.36 to go this far and we'll be able to get water from the streams and purify it and then we'll go
00:12:39.36 --> 00:12:45.76 another distance and we'll get some more. Well, the first, like two or three streams that we
00:12:45.76 --> 00:12:52.24 came across were empty. They would dry it up. And so I was running danger close on water. And I'll
00:12:52.24 --> 00:12:59.28 tell you, not having water to me is the second, the second worst feeling in the world, the worst feeling
00:12:59.28 --> 00:13:04.64 the world is don't, don't have air. But the thing is, we don't have air. That's only a bad feeling
00:13:04.64 --> 00:13:11.12 for like 30 seconds. And then your past time. Yeah, you're done. Not have water. It takes a while.
00:13:12.32 --> 00:13:17.44 So, and when you try, when you go too deep in the red zone there, it's not like you can just
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:20.88 drink water and get out. Like air. A lot of times like when you're like, let's say you're in the
00:13:20.88 --> 00:13:26.48 red zone air. But you can still recover. You just take a huge breath on the road to the cover. But
00:13:26.48 --> 00:13:33.28 water, you get like a forreal heat exhaustion or a heat stroke is death, but like exhaustion, like a
00:13:33.28 --> 00:13:37.76 forreal one. And you drink water, you'll just throw it up because your body can't really take
00:13:37.76 --> 00:13:42.24 in that kind of water yet. You have to do the IV thing, you have to do this big process, you know?
00:13:42.24 --> 00:13:47.68 So, oh yeah, no water is shit. So, I'm sure someone will contact us and tell us like,
00:13:47.68 --> 00:13:52.56 what the, there's got to be some minimum protocol. Because that's the thing that I have, you know,
00:13:52.56 --> 00:13:55.76 you got to have some kind of minimum protocol. Like what's the minimum amount of water you need?
00:13:56.96 --> 00:14:01.84 I hate being thirsty. I would carry a lot of water. Yeah, I would carry a lot of water. But you know,
00:14:01.84 --> 00:14:05.12 you know, you just made me think of, you know, when you're caught in a triangle or something or
00:14:05.12 --> 00:14:08.64 you're caught in a guillotine and you get out and like how good you're going to stay.
00:14:09.68 --> 00:14:14.88 Oh, I feel so good. I feel so good. I guess it's really triangle.
00:14:14.88 --> 00:14:21.76 So, triangles are hard to breathe, but like a guillotine and a guill choke, you're like having a
00:14:21.76 --> 00:14:27.12 hard time breathing. Yeah, because like a good, re-er naked, you know, you're not, it's a different,
00:14:27.12 --> 00:14:30.56 you don't, you don't feel all panicky. Right? Because you're still taking breaths. Yeah. You're
00:14:30.56 --> 00:14:36.32 like, oh good, I'm good, good night. You're right about the guillotine there because I think there's
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:41.44 two elements in the guillotine defense that makes you not breathe. So like one, it's pressing
00:14:41.44 --> 00:14:44.80 against your windpipes. So you can't hardly breathe. But another one, you're trying to tense your
00:14:44.80 --> 00:14:50.40 net to resist like that, that torque. So when you tense your neck, it's like harder to actually
00:14:50.40 --> 00:14:56.000 take a, take a deep breath, you know, it's like those double things. I've been training with Dean,
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.44 Dean, Listsch, Dean Lister for a long time, 25 years. He showed me some guillotine defense the other
00:15:03.44 --> 00:15:09.44 day and I was like, you waited 25 years to show me this guillotine defense, I couldn't guillet
00:15:09.44 --> 00:15:13.12 him and then he couldn't guillet me show this defense. I'm like, what, what, what, why wouldn't you show
00:15:13.12 --> 00:15:17.92 me that? Why would you not show me that? Yeah, bro. That's probably like he has so many,
00:15:17.92 --> 00:15:23.52 you know what? He has so many things, but he also, he just thinks that everybody knows everything.
00:15:23.52 --> 00:15:27.76 Right. You know, so if you don't ask him about it and the only reason he was showing someone
00:15:27.76 --> 00:15:31.04 else and I'm like, what's that defense? He goes, oh, you just do this here and put this hand here
00:15:31.04 --> 00:15:36.96 and I was like, you never show me that. Yeah, he was, oh, oh yeah, that's real obvious.
00:15:36.96 --> 00:15:41.28 I feel like an idiot. All right. So there you go. Water discipline.
00:15:43.76 --> 00:15:51.04 Next, I have just been promoted from first sergeant. This is sergeant major B, Medsger fifth
00:15:51.04 --> 00:15:56.80 Marines. I have just been promoted from first sergeant. In the firefighting, the Marine first sergeant
00:15:56.80 --> 00:16:03.04 helps the company commander. He checks up on the company as a whole, even down to checking on
00:16:03.04 --> 00:16:08.40 the evacuation of the wounded. I was able. I was available to the company commander for any emergency
00:16:09.12 --> 00:16:15.20 orders during the firefight. Teacher soldiers serve that when a man is hit in the assault to
00:16:15.20 --> 00:16:22.16 leave him there. Too many of our men suddenly become first aid men. Your men will have to be rugged
00:16:22.16 --> 00:16:28.08 and rough and to win. They must learn to disregard politeness and must kill.
00:16:28.08 --> 00:16:37.36 So a couple things there. First of all, I'm going deep on this. So first of all, this is what
00:16:37.36 --> 00:16:40.96 I used to, when I used to teach, when I used to teach the young seals about leadership,
00:16:40.96 --> 00:16:44.96 I would teach roles in responsibility for every individual person inside of a politoon
00:16:45.92 --> 00:16:50.48 from a leadership perspective, fire team leader, squad leader, put tune leader,
00:16:50.48 --> 00:16:55.60 task leader leader, a company commander level. And the senior and listed guy,
00:16:55.60 --> 00:17:03.92 which is what he's the company first sergeant. And what you want to do and the way I used to explain
00:17:03.92 --> 00:17:08.72 it to guys in the exact same thing and he's saying you want to be the action arm for the leader
00:17:08.72 --> 00:17:12.88 for the commander. So basically you're the guy with all this experience.
00:17:14.24 --> 00:17:19.76 But if something's going wrong, like you got a problem, you got to be the guy that the company
00:17:19.76 --> 00:17:24.64 commander can look at and go says, go solve that problem and you have the capacity to do it,
00:17:24.64 --> 00:17:31.20 because you're not assigned any specific role. So you should actually do your best to keep your
00:17:31.20 --> 00:17:39.92 company first sergeant like free from direct responsibility so that he can be your action arm
00:17:39.92 --> 00:17:45.04 to go make things happen. That's number one, number two is prioritizing execute.
00:17:46.32 --> 00:17:51.36 Everyone wants to help out the wounded guy. You can't. You got to win first. You can't, you can't
00:17:51.36 --> 00:18:01.44 do that. And then let's face it. This is total war. And these guys are just in a different level.
00:18:01.44 --> 00:18:05.68 You got to disregard politeness and you got to just kill people. That's where we're at.
00:18:07.68 --> 00:18:12.08 That's what's so interesting about about with the old breed by Eugene Sledge.
00:18:13.04 --> 00:18:19.92 And in the HPO series, the Pacific, they portray Eugene Sledge. He's kind of like this
00:18:19.92 --> 00:18:26.80 very nice, very polite guy. That's how they portray him. And then you see videos of the real
00:18:26.80 --> 00:18:31.76 guy, the real Eugene Sledge. That's exactly what he's like. He's kind of like a southern gentleman,
00:18:31.76 --> 00:18:40.08 young, very nice, very kind. And those guys were getting thrown into this savvetry.
00:18:41.12 --> 00:18:45.12 And that's what this, that's what this, that's who this message is for. You got to disregard
00:18:45.12 --> 00:18:50.64 politeness and kill. Now Eugene Sledge, we should probably, we should probably do that book again,
00:18:50.64 --> 00:18:55.92 but Eugene Sledge, you know, he had to, he had to put some things in check himself. And he watched
00:18:55.92 --> 00:19:02.80 guys rip in Japanese soldiers teeth out that were gold and like, you know, pissing on the, and
00:19:02.80 --> 00:19:08.96 then he saw crazy stuff. And he had like a line that he didn't cross over. But he also understood it.
00:19:08.96 --> 00:19:16.64 So even a guy that says nice and, and a good of a person, which Eugene Sledge apparently was,
00:19:17.52 --> 00:19:23.20 even he realized like, this is, this is next level. There's another situation. This is normal.
00:19:24.64 --> 00:19:30.80 Patoon Sergeant HR strong company A fifth Marines. Some of my men thought their hand grenades
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:36.16 were too heavy. They tossed them aside when no one was looking later. They would have given six
00:19:36.16 --> 00:19:42.80 months pay for one hand grenade. There you go. Short turn versus long turn.
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.92 Got to carry that little extra weight of the hand grenade.
00:19:49.20 --> 00:19:54.88 Patoon Sergeant FTO Fera company B fifth Marines after the japs had been located. My
00:19:54.88 --> 00:19:59.76 Patoon has gained the element of surprise by moving in fast with bayonets and hand grenades.
00:19:59.76 --> 00:20:05.52 In turn, they have surprised us by being in a defensive position on the reverse slope of a
00:20:05.52 --> 00:20:13.84 ridge. I think the snipers look for bar bayarmen. And then Colonel Edson said no doubt about this
00:20:13.84 --> 00:20:23.28 and want to gauge men in one platoon every bayar gunner was hit. So this idea that you could locate
00:20:23.28 --> 00:20:27.52 them, this is sort of like in jiu jitsu when you get, let's say you get the mount position you
00:20:27.52 --> 00:20:32.08 immediately go for the arm lock. Sometimes that's what enough to do it, right? Whereas if you get
00:20:32.08 --> 00:20:35.76 mount and you're like, okay, I got the mount, that person's going into defensive position and now they're
00:20:35.76 --> 00:20:42.24 going to set up for it. And so what he's saying is if they locate the Japanese, immediately they go
00:20:42.24 --> 00:20:46.72 out and with grenades and bayonets, which the good thing about grenades and bayonets is now you're,
00:20:46.72 --> 00:20:51.28 they can't really locate you because of your, because of your muzzle flashes and where you're
00:20:51.28 --> 00:20:57.76 shooting, you're just getting in there with grenades and bayonets, which is, you know,
00:20:57.76 --> 00:21:07.52 you think about modern warfare, you don't think of the tactic of, hey, when we make contact,
00:21:07.52 --> 00:21:12.80 we're going to immediately attack with bayonets and grenades. That's what kind of war this was.
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:21.92 Patoon Sergeant R.A. Zolo, company C5th Marines. Sir, I would like to tell you that
00:21:21.92 --> 00:21:28.32 that a man's keenness or doneness of I made determine whether or not he will live. 10 men in
00:21:28.32 --> 00:21:33.84 my platoon were killed because they walked up on a jab 37 millimeter gun. I went up later after the
00:21:33.84 --> 00:21:38.56 gun had been put out by our mortars to help bring back the dead. The Japanese gun was so well
00:21:38.56 --> 00:21:42.72 camouflaged that I got within four feet of the gun before I saw it.
00:21:42.72 --> 00:21:54.80 Corporal WA McClusky, company D5th Marines. Sir, the other day on bloody ridge riflemen
00:21:54.80 --> 00:21:59.44 protecting our light machine guns pulled out and left us. We were doing okay at the time,
00:21:59.44 --> 00:22:06.24 but they're pulling out caused our whole outfit to withdraw. I think the men in these rifle
00:22:06.24 --> 00:22:10.40 companies should receive some training in the work and in the mission of the machine gun
00:22:10.40 --> 00:22:15.20 company they should be able to act more intelligently. What does that mean? You should have your
00:22:15.20 --> 00:22:21.04 team cross train no matter what business you're in. No matter what kind of team you have. You should
00:22:21.04 --> 00:22:25.92 cross train and the interesting thing about that and we've read that we've read about this before.
00:22:28.08 --> 00:22:32.64 When people see other people running away, you've got a pretty good chance that those people
00:22:32.64 --> 00:22:41.60 are going to run away too. This is just mob mentality. Second lieutenant Andrew Tysik,
00:22:41.60 --> 00:22:47.36 fifth Marines. I think that in the regimental supply there should be extra canteen so when the
00:22:47.36 --> 00:22:52.40 out when an outfit gets in a place like the table plateau where there is no water and extra
00:22:52.40 --> 00:22:57.28 canteen of water can be issued. Sir, this would really help our men stay in there.
00:22:57.28 --> 00:23:03.36 What's interesting, this is all done like an interview. That's why they keep saying things like
00:23:03.36 --> 00:23:07.04 sir, they're talking directly to this guy and he's just putting the clothes in there. They're talking
00:23:07.04 --> 00:23:14.000 to Colonel Reader. Marine Gunner, ES rust, fifth Marines. I hate to admit it, but it's the truth.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.08 When we got here, a lot of our young men were confused at night. They were not used to the
00:23:18.08 --> 00:23:22.48 jungle at night. They could not use their compasses at night and we did not have enough
00:23:22.48 --> 00:23:27.52 compasses. We have learned that when we get off the beaten trails it seems to confuse the japs
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:32.48 and we have better success. So what does that mean? You've got to train at night. Platoon Sergeant J.
00:23:32.48 --> 00:23:38.32 CL Hollingsworth, company H. Fifth Marines. When we moved around on these jungle trails, we have
00:23:38.32 --> 00:23:43.68 learned to have men at the rear of each platoon who carry light loads so they can quickly,
00:23:43.68 --> 00:23:48.72 so they can get their weapons into action quickly to help overcome ambush fire from the rear.
00:23:48.72 --> 00:24:00.32 That's what you want to do as a human, as a human that's strategizing in the world,
00:24:00.32 --> 00:24:08.40 is you want to have an element that's flexible and can move quickly to help you overcome situations.
00:24:08.40 --> 00:24:13.36 So whether you're in business, whether you, whatever situation you're in,
00:24:13.36 --> 00:24:24.24 you want to have a specific element that is designed to move quickly and give support where it's
00:24:24.24 --> 00:24:29.68 needed. Could go left, could go right, could go north, could go south, could go east, could go west.
00:24:29.68 --> 00:24:36.80 Why do you need that? Because you can't predict the future. So you should design your plans
00:24:36.80 --> 00:24:47.68 so that the design of the plans is inherently flexible. Put the big rugged men into the heavy weapons
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:55.52 company. Just throwing out their froll the young men going in the military. They're going to
00:24:55.52 --> 00:25:02.32 saddle you up with that big gun and you're going to carry it. Good. From some of our new men were so
00:25:02.32 --> 00:25:06.48 scared of our hand grenades when they first, when they were first issued that they jammed the down the
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:13.76 codder pin later in action, they could not pull the pin. I noticed as I get and I pointed out,
00:25:13.76 --> 00:25:18.88 pointed this out to my platoon that when a man gets hit, the men close by get to yell in
00:25:18.88 --> 00:25:23.84 corn and corn and cornmen. They get so excited sometimes that they actually forget to use their own first
00:25:23.84 --> 00:25:30.96 aid packets. In first aid training, teach correct use of injecting morphine and procedure of tagging
00:25:30.96 --> 00:25:38.08 because what are you going to do when the cornmen gets hit? I give $75 for a pair of tennis shoes to
00:25:38.08 --> 00:25:48.24 rest my feet and for use in night work. Classic. I have only been in the Marine Corps for years,
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:52.48 but I have learned that you have got to develop a sense of responsibility in the men wearing
00:25:52.48 --> 00:26:00.32 Chevron's. Right? You got to develop that responsibility. In action, we have had unauthorized
00:26:00.32 --> 00:26:09.12 persons yelling cease firing or commenced firing this caused confusion. Platoon Sergeant George E.
00:26:10.08 --> 00:26:16.72 A. Ho. Ah Ho. Company fifth. Company fifth. Company fifth. I put five years in the US Army
00:26:16.72 --> 00:26:20.96 before joining the Marine Corps. Sir, I like the Marines better than the Army because the
00:26:20.96 --> 00:26:26.24 average Marine officer is closer to his men than the average Army officer whom I observed.
00:26:26.24 --> 00:26:31.28 We have comradeship in the Marine Corps. Also, the Marine and listed men are more Spartan like.
00:26:31.28 --> 00:26:36.48 I believe, sir, we baby our soldiers too much in peace time. I hope we are not doing this now.
00:26:38.40 --> 00:26:45.68 And then here's a comment from Colonel Reader here. I asked Colonel Edson,
00:26:45.68 --> 00:26:51.76 and Edson is the guy that we read the Medal of Honor citation from. I asked Colonel Edson what
00:26:51.76 --> 00:26:57.12 kind of a sergeant, A. Ho. was. And he told me that he was one of the outstanding men in his
00:26:57.12 --> 00:27:03.76 regiment and that he was a very rugged individual. I heard that. I was like, I can picture this
00:27:03.76 --> 00:27:12.000 dude. You know, he gets described as you're in Guamalcanal with Marines. And you in that
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.28 environment with the toughest bastors in the world, you get, you get described as a quote,
00:27:17.28 --> 00:27:24.32 very rugged individual. You know, George E. A. Ho. Platoon Sergeant company F. Fifth Rees
00:27:24.32 --> 00:27:29.92 doesn't play around. He continues on. In our training for this jungle warfare, we had a great
00:27:29.92 --> 00:27:38.80 deal of work and hand-to-hand individual combat use of knife, jujitsu, etc. Let's face it when I read
00:27:38.80 --> 00:27:44.32 that I got very, very, very, you know, we were feeling good about it. What's the year on that?
00:27:44.32 --> 00:27:51.84 In 1943? Yeah. That's the tradition. Jujitsu. It's not the prison. Jujitsu. Okay. Well, maybe it is
00:27:51.84 --> 00:27:57.68 actually because in 1925. That's what it is. Yeah. But this is prejuato. No, it's not prejuato.
00:27:57.68 --> 00:28:01.92 So it's jujitsu. Let's take it for one of its work. Anyways, your excitement is going to go
00:28:01.92 --> 00:28:05.28 down just like mine did because he says this. With the exception of bayonet fighting,
00:28:05.28 --> 00:28:10.40 we have not used this work. I've been in many battles since I hit the island and I've never seen
00:28:10.40 --> 00:28:18.48 anyone use it. Okay. So did some hand-to-hand training? Well, I think maybe just out of sort of
00:28:18.48 --> 00:28:26.72 GPL would have found a way to get my hand-to-hand. I could bring the jets. Every man should have a watch.
00:28:27.92 --> 00:28:35.36 That's a good one. Just to kind of let you know. I mean, think about you're going to
00:28:35.36 --> 00:28:42.08 warn you. No, I'm a watch. Our battalion commander made your wall once every last man in our
00:28:42.08 --> 00:28:51.04 battalion to know as much as he does about the situation. It pays. Think about that. You're in a
00:28:51.04 --> 00:28:56.64 leadership position. You should try and get every last man and your team to know as much as you do
00:28:56.64 --> 00:29:03.76 about the situation. It will pay off. He also says this. Get rid of gold bricks. It's better to be
00:29:03.76 --> 00:29:11.28 short-handed, having good men around than having a lot of underpendibles. You familiar with the
00:29:11.28 --> 00:29:17.92 term gold brick? No. Not in this context anyway. What context are you familiar with it in?
00:29:17.92 --> 00:29:23.76 A regular gold brick. Which is? That's a gold bar. Okay, got it, got it, got it. So that's the difference.
00:29:23.76 --> 00:29:30.40 A gold bar is made of gold. A gold brick is a brick painted like gold. Got. Have you ever seen the
00:29:30.40 --> 00:29:41.12 big Lebowski? Yeah, but like once. The term is heavily used in gold brick. So a gold brick is
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.76 not it looks like good. You just hear for show. It looks good. No, no, no, no, no, no, go. All that
00:29:47.76 --> 00:29:52.16 exactly. Man, I got a book I just read for this podcast that will be coming in the future. But
00:29:52.16 --> 00:29:57.84 there's a guy that shows up in the Korean war and he's all square away and he's all he's all
00:29:57.84 --> 00:30:03.84 like right and tight. Everything's good to go and the older combat vets are like, I don't think so.
00:30:03.84 --> 00:30:07.28 And then one younger guy that's kind of that's a badass that's actually writing the book.
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:11.76 He says, oh yeah, this guy's going to be good to go and sure enough. The older veterans,
00:30:11.76 --> 00:30:17.04 we're looking at him, he was suspect. He was suspect because he was like everything was kind of
00:30:17.04 --> 00:30:22.72 perfect. Kind of like that conversation we had the other day about music and everything being
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:26.64 perfect and if it's too perfect, it's not real. Well, that's kind of the impression these guys got,
00:30:26.64 --> 00:30:32.08 oh, this guy is totally perfect. Well, guess what happened when the bullet started flying? He had a,
00:30:32.08 --> 00:30:41.36 he had a trick knee and all of a sudden he couldn't get after it. So to me, that right there,
00:30:41.36 --> 00:30:49.52 gold brick. Got you. Corporal JS Stankas company, E fifth Marines. On this is Harry firing,
00:30:49.52 --> 00:30:53.28 gives your position away and when you give your position away, here you have to pay for it.
00:30:53.28 --> 00:31:02.48 Man, I went on like the crazy, I've gone on crazy tendons about giving away your position.
00:31:02.48 --> 00:31:05.76 On that's very firing and I'm not talking about combat. I'm talking about
00:31:05.76 --> 00:31:11.20 in conversations, in leadership situations where you give away your position.
00:31:12.48 --> 00:31:16.72 You take shots at echo. Ecclesions, you know, I'd like to use this plan over here and I go,
00:31:16.72 --> 00:31:20.000 that plan doesn't make any sense. And now I'll say, you know what I stand.
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.92 Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Why would you do that? Why would I say, well, explain to me more about your plan?
00:31:27.28 --> 00:31:29.12 And then ask you a question about it.
00:31:30.24 --> 00:31:35.44 Because if I, if I give my position away, all of a sudden you're, you're not even, you're already like defensive.
00:31:35.44 --> 00:31:39.84 I'm causing problems. Why do that? Hmm. And by the way, you might now attack me, because I just gave my
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:44.000 position away. Now you might start throwing shots at me. So when you say, here's my plan, and I say,
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.92 you're playing doesn't make any sense. I just gave my position away. I don't think your plan makes sense.
00:31:47.92 --> 00:31:52.72 There's my position. Whereas if you say, here's my plan, and I say, why do you want to put guys over here?
00:31:52.72 --> 00:31:56.48 Or why do you want to move this over here? And you start answering my questions. I haven't given my position away.
00:31:56.48 --> 00:32:00.40 You're not defensive. You're trying to explain it to me. Maybe your plan makes sense, but I just didn't
00:32:00.40 --> 00:32:05.84 understand it. Hmm. So don't give your position away. Notting Guadalcanal and not in the,
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:11.52 meeting with your, with your team. Hmm.
00:32:11.52 --> 00:32:18.72 The men in my squad fire low at the base of trees. There's too much high firing going on. I have
00:32:18.72 --> 00:32:28.48 I have observed. Japs often get short of ammunition. They cut bamboo and crack it together to simulate
00:32:28.48 --> 00:32:32.80 rifle fire to draw our fire. They ain't Superman. They're just tricky bastards.
00:32:32.80 --> 00:32:42.64 Second Lieutenant HM Davis fifth Marines in parentheses promoted on the field of battle. Do you
00:32:42.64 --> 00:32:48.40 understand what that means? Uh, thanks. Okay. So you understand that there's enlisted guys in the
00:32:48.40 --> 00:32:52.000 military. And there's officers. Yeah. So basically the enlisted guys have not gone to college.
00:32:52.88 --> 00:32:58.000 The officers. Well, I guess the enlisted guys may have gone to college, especially nowadays. There's a lot of
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.20 enlisted guys that are going to college. But the in these days, most likely the enlisted guy hadn't gone to college.
00:33:03.20 --> 00:33:07.68 So they went through a regular training pipeline and you're sort of the workforce of the military,
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:12.40 then the officers, they've been to college and they've been through some kind of a training program
00:33:12.40 --> 00:33:17.92 to make put them into a leadership position. Is that kind of like at a company, the difference between a guy who
00:33:17.92 --> 00:33:23.20 has a great resume degree, blah, blah comes in at a certain high position versus the guy who worked his way
00:33:23.20 --> 00:33:30.32 up through like the mail rule. So a little bit, but let's say a construction site you've got a guy that
00:33:30.32 --> 00:33:35.12 went to college for civil engineering and he's he's overseeing the whole project, right? And he's
00:33:35.12 --> 00:33:40.24 he got his degree three years ago. But then you've got a guy that's been working construction
00:33:40.24 --> 00:33:45.28 since he was 14 years old and now he's been doing it for 28 years and he's the foreman or he's
00:33:45.28 --> 00:33:52.96 any of those people in between. Right. That's that's kind of the break out. So to get promoted on the
00:33:52.96 --> 00:34:01.60 field about a battlefield promotion to be commissioned is it's pretty powerful. That means that
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:09.84 when all this mayhem was going on, they skipped you through like entire an entire spectrum of
00:34:09.84 --> 00:34:15.76 promotions to the next completely different level. It's hack worth actually in Korea. Got
00:34:15.76 --> 00:34:19.52 battlefield promoted. Like you're so good. We're going to take you and we're going to put you in charge.
00:34:19.52 --> 00:34:27.84 Yeah. So it'd be like if it'd be like if you showed up as the brick carrier and you did such a good
00:34:27.84 --> 00:34:31.12 job and then they said, well you can put start putting, but you did that and you did something else
00:34:31.12 --> 00:34:35.04 and then the next thing they promoted you to the guy that was the civil engineer. Put you in
00:34:35.04 --> 00:34:41.20 charge the whole project. So that's because when you hear about second lieutenant HM Davis,
00:34:41.20 --> 00:34:48.80 fifth Marines promoted on the field of battle. We're talking about full legit. He says travel light.
00:34:49.60 --> 00:34:53.76 For example, the hell with all the mess equipment. We used our mess cup and spoon for the first 15
00:34:53.76 --> 00:35:00.64 days here and enjoyed our chow. You don't have to live like a gentleman in jungle warfare. Our
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:07.36 mess equipment is too bulky for this type of warfare makes noise. There you go. And then he says this,
00:35:07.36 --> 00:35:15.12 not every man can lead a battalion. Find out who can lead your battalions before you go into combat
00:35:15.12 --> 00:35:25.12 areas. And then Colonel Edson, in parentheses, remarked by Colonel Edson says, I would like to
00:35:25.12 --> 00:35:30.56 concur in that statement. So the metal of honor recipient, the commander of that battalion.
00:35:30.56 --> 00:35:39.84 He says, I like to concur with that. There's something that's so pure and just unmercifully
00:35:39.84 --> 00:35:45.60 beautiful about combat when it comes to like, hey, we can't we don't we can't afford to play around.
00:35:45.60 --> 00:35:51.28 It's kind of cool when I was in Sri Lanka, which we covered on like podcasts three or something
00:35:51.28 --> 00:35:58.000 working with those soldiers that were fighting against the to meal tigers. And if they had someone
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.32 that was good, they'd be like you're promoted. You're going to be in charge. If they had someone
00:36:02.32 --> 00:36:07.76 that bad, you're you're not in charge anymore. They didn't care about anything. There was no HR department.
00:36:07.76 --> 00:36:11.36 There was no, hey, we're going to document what mistakes you made. We're going to count to you.
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:16.72 They're like, no, you made like five bad calls and wrote, you're done. And you, young recruit that's
00:36:16.72 --> 00:36:22.72 been doing great. You're you're in the game. You will put you in charge. It was very cool. And that's
00:36:22.72 --> 00:36:28.64 what happens in war. It doesn't so much happen in peacetime. In an advanced and in an advanced
00:36:28.64 --> 00:36:34.48 in the jungle, it's hard for a platoon leader to keep control of his men. Corporals and their
00:36:34.48 --> 00:36:40.96 men must be taught to act individually. It's a little something that we like to call decentralized
00:36:40.96 --> 00:36:46.56 to command. You are not going to be with everyone. You can't control them. It doesn't work.
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:58.08 Platoon sergeant, CM, Fagan, company on fifth Marines. I haven't been fired at many times
00:36:58.08 --> 00:37:02.72 by snipers and I haven't seen one yet. I threw that in there was a lot. I skipped over some
00:37:02.72 --> 00:37:10.32 of these, but there's a lot of people complaining about snipers. The sabers, which the Japanese
00:37:10.32 --> 00:37:15.12 officers carry have proved to be worthless. I killed two japs who came out me with sabers and I
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:22.64 got them first by shooting them. You remember that scene in Indiana Jones? Yes, or you know,
00:37:22.64 --> 00:37:28.72 all scenes. Which one? Some guy comes out and he's swinging a sword around like kind of a
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:36.64 real sealed. I got the sword and we're going to fight in Indiana Jones, shrugs and
00:37:36.64 --> 00:37:40.96 children just pulls a pistol out and shoots. That's what I mean. When I heard this all was like, well,
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:45.76 yeah, if you've got a gun, these make it a statement. Hey, a gun is better than a saber.
00:37:46.48 --> 00:37:53.04 Well, thank you. We agree. But this is a new kind of obvious. That scene in Indiana Jones.
00:37:53.04 --> 00:37:59.84 Yeah. A US for it. So here you go. That scene in real life, they were going to have or the original
00:37:59.84 --> 00:38:04.24 script or whatever. They were going to have a this epic kind of battle sword battle. But in the
00:38:04.24 --> 00:38:11.76 end, or Tereson Ford had to use a bathroom, bro bad. So he pulled that out as a little improv. They just
00:38:11.76 --> 00:38:19.60 kept it. Cool. Good to know. Never mind the bottom. Water canal. Let's hear about the bathroom battles
00:38:19.60 --> 00:38:26.96 on the set of Indiana Jones. It's different. I haven't seen this. Then he says this, but I wish
00:38:26.96 --> 00:38:33.36 I had in reserve a good jungle knife. I don't mean I don't mean a bowloat, which we should
00:38:33.36 --> 00:38:40.000 have for cutting trails, but a knife with a 12 inch blade, a good steel. We could use this against
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.92 these, these japs as well as cutting vines that catch us at night. And then says, no, many men
00:38:45.92 --> 00:38:52.48 expressed their wish for a jungle knife, such as described here. This desire is being omitted
00:38:52.48 --> 00:38:57.84 in further remarks to avoid repetition. So everybody who's like, give us a big ass knife.
00:38:57.84 --> 00:39:07.92 Corporal Fred Carter company, I fifth Marines. On the river, we got to firing at each other
00:39:08.56 --> 00:39:13.12 because of careless leadership by the junior officers. We had a little blue on blue situation.
00:39:13.12 --> 00:39:20.000 We are curing ourselves of fromissue as firing, but I should think new units would get training
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.32 to make the men careful. There you go. This guy's had a little blue on blue situation. And he's
00:39:26.32 --> 00:39:31.44 saying, I should think new units would get training to make the men more careful. Yeah.
00:39:33.60 --> 00:39:38.88 That's what I did when I had a blue on blue friendly fire situation came back and said,
00:39:38.88 --> 00:39:44.48 I'm going to train people. So this doesn't happen to him. We learned not to fire unless we had
00:39:44.48 --> 00:39:48.24 something to shoot at, doing otherwise discloses your position in where you say ammunition.
00:39:48.24 --> 00:39:58.48 He says, I've been charged twice by the Japs in bayonet charge. Armourines can outbrain
00:39:58.48 --> 00:40:04.88 up fight them and I know our army men will do the same. And then note by Colonel Edison,
00:40:04.88 --> 00:40:10.64 incidentally, in the last push, we executed. We executed three bayonet charges.
00:40:10.64 --> 00:40:24.72 Sergeant O. J. Marion company L fifth Marines, a platoon guide. You crawl in the advance.
00:40:24.72 --> 00:40:34.24 Unless you are to charge and make it. The reason for this is that all men hit our hit from the
00:40:34.24 --> 00:40:40.72 knees up except for ricochets. We have crawled up to within 25 yards of a machine gun firing over
00:40:40.72 --> 00:40:48.000 our backs. The Japs don't depress their machine gun. Men get killed rushing to help a wounded man.
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.72 If the wounded man would crawl about 10 yards to his flank, he can generally be aided in safety
00:40:52.72 --> 00:40:58.24 as the Japs seem to fire down lanes in the jungle. Colonel Edison said, we have taught our
00:40:58.24 --> 00:41:02.72 men that in the best way to aid a wounded man is to push ahead so that the wounded man can be cared
00:41:02.72 --> 00:41:11.28 for by the Corbin. The men have been the men have to be trained individually for when the fire
00:41:11.28 --> 00:41:16.32 starts, the corporal can't see all of his men and further when the order for attack is given,
00:41:16.32 --> 00:41:21.76 any number of men are unable to see the man on his right or left. So you see, sir, it takes guts
00:41:21.76 --> 00:41:29.20 for the men to get up and move forward when the signal is given. The men have to depend on one
00:41:29.20 --> 00:41:35.76 another and have confidence in each other. So again, if you've been trippled like this,
00:41:35.76 --> 00:41:41.04 you have a trippled canopy jungle, like real thick jungle. Yeah, obviously, it's really,
00:41:41.04 --> 00:41:45.76 you can take five steps and you can't see that another person. And that's what these guys are
00:41:45.76 --> 00:41:49.52 seeing for the first time. Well, not for the first time, but they're seeing, hey,
00:41:50.32 --> 00:41:54.80 somebody gets five feet away from me. I can't see anymore. They have to know how to act on
00:41:54.80 --> 00:42:01.28 their own. They have to be ready to utilize decentralized command. He says, I was in one advance
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:06.80 when the Japs let us come through and then rose up out of covered foxholes and shot us in the back.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:16.56 The best cure for that is rear guard looking towards the rear. Corporal FR, Macauan,
00:42:16.56 --> 00:42:22.40 company L fifth Marines. Sometimes the information doesn't get down to us and then we are really in the
00:42:22.40 --> 00:42:28.08 dark. When we get the orders and information, we can get in there and pitch better. Again,
00:42:29.84 --> 00:42:37.92 make sure you keep your people informed. My普通 is the best one in the company because we are
00:42:37.92 --> 00:42:43.04 all like a baseball team. Our lieutenant is like the captain of the team. He is close with us and
00:42:43.04 --> 00:42:49.12 we like him and yet respect him. We have a wonderful普通. I'm not bragging. That's a fact.
00:42:49.12 --> 00:42:56.64 And then here's the note in parentheses. When I read this to Colonel Etz and at the end of the day,
00:42:56.64 --> 00:43:01.20 he was so delighted that he sent a runner to find out who corporal Macauan's platoon leader was.
00:43:01.92 --> 00:43:11.28 Give that guy a promotion. And here's the interview with Colonel Merit Etz and himself. And again,
00:43:11.28 --> 00:43:18.40 this is the guy who received the Medal of Honor that I read at the beginning of this podcast.
00:43:20.56 --> 00:43:26.72 He says, if I had to train my regiment over again, I would stress small group training and the
00:43:26.72 --> 00:43:32.80 training of the individual even more than we did when we were in training. So there you go. Everyone is
00:43:32.80 --> 00:43:36.48 stressing that people need to be able to think for themselves and make things happen.
00:43:36.48 --> 00:43:44.16 And there must be training and difficult observation, which is needed for the offense.
00:43:44.88 --> 00:43:51.44 It is my observation that only 5% of the men can really see while observing.
00:43:55.28 --> 00:44:03.52 Yeah. What's crazy about that is they do drills, especially human sniper school, where they put
00:44:03.52 --> 00:44:09.84 like stuff out in the field, like a canteen and a knife and a notebook. They put all the stuff in the field.
00:44:10.80 --> 00:44:17.52 And then they bring you out to the field and you get to sit and position you got to look and
00:44:17.52 --> 00:44:23.60 you got to see. You got to have a kind of hidden partially hidden. So they'll put 10 items out there.
00:44:23.60 --> 00:44:26.88 And you got to sit there with your notebook and you got to write down all the items that you can
00:44:26.88 --> 00:44:31.68 see in what their location is. And somebody that's really and there's different people have
00:44:31.68 --> 00:44:37.12 different levels of skill at actually observing things. So some people get, oh they get 9,
00:44:37.12 --> 00:44:43.28 they get 8, they get 10. Some people see like three or four things. So to actually train for that
00:44:43.28 --> 00:44:49.28 is important. The other crazy thing about this is I'll talk about this on a EF online the other day.
00:44:53.36 --> 00:44:59.36 It's hard. It's hard to see and sometimes things that you think are so obvious
00:44:59.36 --> 00:45:07.84 other people aren't seeing. And sometimes if you think what you're doing, no one can see,
00:45:08.80 --> 00:45:12.56 they can all see it. So if you think you're making some little tactical move that no one's saying
00:45:12.56 --> 00:45:19.36 you're wrong. If you're making some little maneuver to get that position or whatever and you think
00:45:19.36 --> 00:45:25.44 that it's all good, no one can see it. You're wrong. Everybody can see it. Everybody can see it.
00:45:25.44 --> 00:45:36.16 You know who can't see it? You can't see that they can see. The offensive is the most difficult
00:45:36.16 --> 00:45:42.24 to support as you cannot tell exactly where your troops are. So scary. Whether the
00:45:42.24 --> 00:45:46.64 Japs will continue to fight as they do now, I don't know that defend on the low ground and
00:45:46.64 --> 00:45:51.68 the jungle, they dig standing trenches extremely well camouflaged. And then he goes into some
00:45:51.68 --> 00:45:58.000 really tactical level stuff talking about the need for a rifle grenade, the need for knee
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000 mortar. Why that would be good because it gives the platoon commander kind of at-hand weapons.
00:46:06.80 --> 00:46:13.04 He says this, I suggest that you have maneuvers with ball ammunition, which is basically
00:46:13.04 --> 00:46:19.28 doom and novers with real bullets. And then he says, even if you get a few casualties,
00:46:19.28 --> 00:46:26.80 he says, I was like dang. And now in the seal teams, we do live fire training all the time.
00:46:27.44 --> 00:46:38.24 And not only that, we do incredibly complex maneuvers with live fire. And it's so beneficial
00:46:39.60 --> 00:46:43.68 that you're just used to it. You know, you're used to it. You really learn about
00:46:43.68 --> 00:46:49.92 paying attention and safety and how to keep your distance and all those really important things.
00:46:53.60 --> 00:46:57.12 But if you, the other thing, I will say we got, when I first came in the teams,
00:46:57.76 --> 00:47:01.84 that's all we did was live fire. And it was sort of like a vuffing.
00:47:02.64 --> 00:47:06.80 You know, it's sort of like, that's as good as it gets like it would do live fire.
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:10.80 It was one of those things. And it was, you know, you go, well, it's live fire. And you do
00:47:10.80 --> 00:47:16.48 so much of it that it became. So it wasn't really, it's just normal, right? Live fire was just totally
00:47:16.48 --> 00:47:22.40 normal. I'll tell you, operate. But once we got some munition and like the high speed laser
00:47:22.40 --> 00:47:28.48 tag systems, that's when you got, you have to do both. But that's when you got good at actually
00:47:29.20 --> 00:47:33.92 combat because when you're going live fire, you're not going against anyone, but paper targets.
00:47:33.92 --> 00:47:43.52 I'm saying don't move. But you have to do it. Yeah. So he goes into more details about the kind of boots
00:47:43.52 --> 00:47:48.48 that they have. And he says the same thing that everyone's been saying in your training, put your
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:52.32 time and emphasis on the squad and platoon rather than on the company, but time and regimen.
00:47:53.04 --> 00:48:00.48 So train at the lowest levels. Your principle of the command post up into the front is certainly true here
00:48:00.48 --> 00:48:09.28 in your scouting and patrolling and your training in patience, which you should have, have the men
00:48:09.28 --> 00:48:14.08 work against each other. So he's saying the same thing, you have to do something where you're actually
00:48:14.08 --> 00:48:19.12 going against other humans, not just against paper targets. Same thing for squad and pltunes in
00:48:19.12 --> 00:48:24.16 their problems. Develop better snipers, it goes on to a bunch of things. Smoking lamp, once a smoking
00:48:24.16 --> 00:48:34.32 lamp goes out and it gets dark, you have to be quiet. Yeah. He goes into this example. In the
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:39.52 Raiders, we adopted the custom of dropping all rank and titles. We used nicknames for officers,
00:48:39.52 --> 00:48:45.28 all ranks used these nicknames for us. We did this because the nips caught onto the names of the
00:48:45.28 --> 00:48:50.72 officers and would yell or speak at night. This is Captain Joe Smith talking, a company with
00:48:50.72 --> 00:48:59.36 draw to the next hill. So we adopted nicknames with code words. Captain Walt became silent
00:48:59.36 --> 00:49:06.16 Lou. My nickname was Red Mike. An example of the use of these nicknames as code words is one night
00:49:06.16 --> 00:49:13.12 the japs put down smoke and the yelled gas. We were too green at the time and two of our companies
00:49:13.12 --> 00:49:23.04 withdrew leaving a company exposed on two flanks. He says a value of night training is that it
00:49:23.04 --> 00:49:29.36 lets men learn the normal noises of the woods at night. Woods are not silent at night. He says the
00:49:29.36 --> 00:49:34.80 Japanese is no Superman. He has the same limitations that we have. They have the advantage of
00:49:34.80 --> 00:49:40.64 experience with proper training. Our Americans are better as our people can think better as individuals.
00:49:40.64 --> 00:49:51.52 Encourage your individuals and bring them out. So this is any team. You either train your team
00:49:51.52 --> 00:49:59.44 to think or train them to obey. Certainly the Japanese leaned toward what they wanted was obedience.
00:50:04.96 --> 00:50:09.04 Both are riflemen and machine gunners must be taught to shoot. I can tell you that's what I got
00:50:09.04 --> 00:50:21.20 shipped all to. Shoot low. This leadership business resolves itself down to being hardboiled.
00:50:21.92 --> 00:50:29.92 By that I mean getting rid of the poor leader even if you like him personally because this is a
00:50:29.92 --> 00:50:34.000 life in death affair. This goes right on down to the non-combs.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:43.36 You can see there's no slack for poor leadership. Like you know it's peace time.
00:50:43.92 --> 00:50:54.80 I can tell you when I first got to the to the bears. The amount of seal officers that got
00:50:54.80 --> 00:51:00.24 fired when they were in a seal platoon was very very small. Very small number of seal officers
00:51:00.24 --> 00:51:06.64 that would get fired. Then after the war started it would happen. It would happen. It was not
00:51:06.64 --> 00:51:12.88 like it happened often. But it happened a lot more. It happened a lot more because you'd be looking
00:51:12.88 --> 00:51:18.48 going there. This isn't just an employment over to train someone or this is going to be
00:51:18.48 --> 00:51:35.20 going to war. That was Colonel Letzon. We get to major LOOL WALT commanding officer
00:51:35.20 --> 00:51:40.000 second battalion fifth Marine. There's a note from Colonel Letzon. Colonel Letzon told me that
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.24 Major WALT was one of his best leaders and one of the best men he has ever seen in action.
00:51:46.24 --> 00:51:52.16 Major WALT was a young man of about 35 years of age. He's extremely rugged and looks like a
00:51:52.16 --> 00:51:57.60 full back on a football team. I talked to him over 20 minutes before I was able to make a single
00:51:57.60 --> 00:52:07.04 original note as his ideas seemed to echo Colonel Edson's. So that's pretty cool. You got the
00:52:07.04 --> 00:52:10.08 battalion commander saying all the same stuff that the regimental commander was saying.
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:20.40 Here's a little report that Major LOOL WALT gives. At 630 PM they smoked our two right
00:52:20.40 --> 00:52:26.32 companies and when the smoke had enveloped these two companies they broke out. They came out in
00:52:26.32 --> 00:52:32.72 mass formation 20 abreast yelling. BANETS fixed automatic weapons working. Rear ranks
00:52:32.72 --> 00:52:38.56 throwing hand grenades. They were trying to escape to the sand pit at the mouth of the river in
00:52:38.56 --> 00:52:45.28 order to cross the river to get back. Our right front company had just completed a double apron
00:52:45.28 --> 00:52:51.04 barbed wire fence. When the Japanese hit the left flank of the right company they killed nine out
00:52:51.04 --> 00:52:57.84 of the first 10 men. Nine out of the first 11 men they hit. Then they hit the barbed wire. Two of our
00:52:57.84 --> 00:53:04.48 heavy machine guns opened up shooting down along this barbed wire fence and dispersed their attack.
00:53:04.48 --> 00:53:11.12 It got dark quickly like it does here. There was smoke. Japs and Marines all mixed up. Three
00:53:11.12 --> 00:53:18.24 Japanese officers were swinging their two hand swords. There was hand-to-hand fighting all night long.
00:53:19.12 --> 00:53:26.72 We mopped them up at Daybreak. We killed 78 Japs. They killed 12 Marines and wounded 26 of us.
00:53:26.72 --> 00:53:36.88 The Jap has a great deal of respect for our hand grenade and it is a valuable weapon to us.
00:53:36.88 --> 00:53:44.88 Do you ever practice throwing it in wooded country? Scary throwing grenades in the woods.
00:53:46.16 --> 00:53:51.52 Because you can hit a tree, you can hit a branch. He says this is always a common theme about the
00:53:51.52 --> 00:53:56.08 Japanese. The Jap is not an individual fighter. He won't fight with a bayonet unless backed up with a
00:53:56.08 --> 00:54:05.44 dozen other Japs. Here's where you get to do this pure leadership. As in the basic
00:54:06.16 --> 00:54:14.96 field manual, each man should know the objective. I make my platoon leader designate an objective
00:54:14.96 --> 00:54:21.04 every 100 yards in the jungle and they work to it and reorganize. They don't push off for the next
00:54:21.04 --> 00:54:25.68 objective until they get word from the company commander. This method we have found ensures
00:54:25.68 --> 00:54:31.84 control. I control my company exactly the same way. I set up objectives for each company when
00:54:31.84 --> 00:54:36.72 the companies reach their objective. They report. After the reorganization we go ahead,
00:54:37.60 --> 00:54:42.40 I think reserves and the attack should be kept up closely. It can be committed immediately.
00:54:47.68 --> 00:54:53.28 Platoon Sergeant CC Ardent. There's a note in here. It says when
00:54:53.28 --> 00:54:59.60 Colonel Edson sent for his best fighters, he did not include Platoon Sergeant Ardent. After I got
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:06.32 through talking to these men, two of them came up to me and said, Sir, you did not see Sergeant Ardent.
00:55:06.32 --> 00:55:11.52 He has more patrols and does more scouting than any man in the regiment. Could we get him for you,
00:55:11.52 --> 00:55:18.16 Sir? Here we go. CC Ardent. He seems like the kind of guy when I was reading this, I was like,
00:55:18.16 --> 00:55:24.000 I know this kind of dude. So here's this dude. I practice walking quietly over rocks,
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:31.36 twigs, grass leaves, through vines, etc. I practiced this around the Bivowack area. I received
00:55:31.36 --> 00:55:37.44 instructions in scouting and patrolling in Kwanako, but I still practice this around here in the Bivowack
00:55:37.44 --> 00:55:43.84 area. I believe because I practice this is the reason I'm still alive. Some of the other
00:55:43.84 --> 00:55:49.44 NCOs laughed at me because I'm always seeing how quietly I can walk around because I go out and
00:55:49.44 --> 00:55:55.04 practice on my own, but they have stopped laughing because I have been on more patrols than any
00:55:55.04 --> 00:56:01.92 man in the regiment and I am still alive. When I am scouting and come to an opening in the jungle
00:56:01.92 --> 00:56:07.12 and have to cross it, I generally run across it quickly and quietly, going slow here, make
00:56:07.12 --> 00:56:16.08 cost a scout his life, different types of terrain calls for different methods. So I totally know
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:27.20 that guy, just obsessed and I love it. Go ahead. Do you think like you did something to do that too?
00:56:27.20 --> 00:56:32.40 You know guys, they stand up and they do like a technical stand, even though you know,
00:56:32.40 --> 00:56:38.72 they're keeping it real. Or when they give you a hug they like fish front. They're always doing
00:56:38.72 --> 00:56:46.72 that the thing, you know. Yeah, but I think this is the guy that's like stand, you know, not just that.
00:56:47.84 --> 00:56:55.20 This is the guy that's and you know, when I when I first got in, actually the whole time I was
00:56:55.20 --> 00:56:58.48 in it was like okay, I got to do this again. I need to do this better. I get to get better with this.
00:56:58.48 --> 00:57:06.72 But I did that kind of in a broad way. Like I kind of wanted to be good at everything, you know?
00:57:08.48 --> 00:57:14.32 Whereas, it'd be like someone, whereas there's some guys that would get really into one thing.
00:57:15.92 --> 00:57:20.72 You know, it'd be like someone that just works on, you know, deep half-guard.
00:57:21.44 --> 00:57:24.40 Maybe just get obsessed with deep half-guard and that's what they're working on. Like that's
00:57:24.40 --> 00:57:37.36 all they're drilling. That's all they're doing. This is Colonel Amor LER Sims.
00:57:40.24 --> 00:57:45.68 Commanding Officer 7th Marines first Marine Division. He says, is the army stripping down to
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:50.24 essentials and equipment teach not to waste ammunition, learn to make every shot count,
00:57:50.24 --> 00:57:55.28 try to get the japs on the move, keep them bouncing around, don't let them get set.
00:57:55.28 --> 00:57:59.68 When you let them get set they're hard to get out. This is such a good philosophy to have
00:57:59.68 --> 00:58:04.16 whenever you're in a competitive moment against another person or against another business or
00:58:04.16 --> 00:58:08.56 against another team. Don't let them settle. Don't let them, you know, like we talked about earlier,
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:14.56 you get them out and go for the Amor. Look, sometimes you think, well, get there in a established position.
00:58:14.56 --> 00:58:20.16 I get it. I get that philosophy. But if you can and you can get there and you can go for it.
00:58:20.16 --> 00:58:24.08 You're going to catch them off guard. Don't let them prepare. Go.
00:58:27.04 --> 00:58:33.44 He says, our battalion commanders in the 7th Marines know that in reporting information at once,
00:58:34.32 --> 00:58:39.52 and if they need help to ask for it and not just try to bowl things through,
00:58:40.56 --> 00:58:44.96 that they are enabling regiments to act as a team in the right manner and in the right direction.
00:58:44.96 --> 00:58:50.08 So he's saying, listen, the battalion commanders knew that they needed to get the information, the
00:58:50.08 --> 00:58:55.84 correct information, up the chain of commanders quickly as they could so that they, so that the chain of
00:58:55.84 --> 00:59:01.52 command, the senior leadership could support them. And if you needed help, you needed to ask for it.
00:59:05.28 --> 00:59:11.84 A regimental commander cannot be impatient. Don't push your battalion commanders unless you
00:59:11.84 --> 00:59:18.08 feel there is reluctancy on their part. Our great leader General Vandergrif gives me a job and
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:25.76 lets me handle the situation with a regiment in my own way. He's not impatient with me.
00:59:25.76 --> 00:59:34.32 Inpatients would ruin the best plans. A mapped plan may not turn out to be feasible, so we have
00:59:34.32 --> 00:59:45.36 learned here not to be impatient. And then he says, it has been impressed upon us here that the
00:59:45.36 --> 00:59:51.04 logistics have to be correctly planned. The science of logistics turns out to be your life logistics,
00:59:51.04 --> 00:59:57.60 winds of ours. Here's the thought I would like to leave you with the regimental commanders.
00:59:57.60 --> 01:00:06.24 Pick your officers for common sense. Basic field manual knowledge is fine, but it is useless
01:00:06.24 --> 01:00:11.36 without common sense. Common sense is of greater value than all the words in the book.
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:18.80 I am too deep, so that's the statement right there, right? Common sense is not amazing.
01:00:18.80 --> 01:00:27.76 Promote and put in leadership positions people at a common sense. Then he says, I am too deep in my
01:00:27.76 --> 01:00:33.12 battalions and regard to battalion commanding officers. That is, each one of my battalion executive
01:00:33.12 --> 01:00:38.40 officers is a potential battalion commander. The reason for this is if the battalion commander gets
01:00:38.40 --> 01:00:45.84 killed or sick, I won't be caught out on the limb. He says, I make my staff officers get out of this
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:51.68 CP, not to snoop so that they get out of the command, post and go to the front lines. And he does
01:00:51.68 --> 01:00:57.04 that quote, not to snoop on the troops, but to help the battalions and equate themselves with
01:00:57.04 --> 01:01:03.52 the general situation insist on night training. But don't train day and night. If I were training
01:01:03.52 --> 01:01:07.76 my regiment again, working seven days a week, I would train three nights and four days.
01:01:09.12 --> 01:01:13.68 Our orders to armorans on the perimeter defense are, this is this is kind of epic.
01:01:13.68 --> 01:01:20.72 Our orders to armorans on the perimeter defense are, you stay on your position and do not pull
01:01:20.72 --> 01:01:26.000 back. If they bust through you, we'll plug up the hole, but you stay there.
01:01:30.24 --> 01:01:37.04 And then he says, this regiment can out yell the japs, out fight them, out bayonet them, and out
01:01:37.04 --> 01:01:43.76 shoot them. This yelling as in hand, a hand action is important. It's like a football team that
01:01:43.76 --> 01:01:51.60 talks it up. The japs yell at us. Marines, we're going to kill you. More blood for the emperor.
01:01:51.60 --> 01:01:57.68 The Marines bail back. You blank, blank, blank, blank. That's just as blank. That's a little
01:01:57.68 --> 01:02:07.52 agro-ized. You blank, blank, blank. We'll kill you, japs, more blood for Franklin.
01:02:10.32 --> 01:02:17.36 There's just a yelling at each other. You know, that was like, when we had cowboy on
01:02:17.36 --> 01:02:27.60 and cowboy could hear the North Vietnamese Army commander yelling, hey get ready to get ready to
01:02:28.24 --> 01:02:35.36 assault. And he's telling, telling Lynn Black, here they come. He just gave the order to assault.
01:02:37.92 --> 01:02:43.36 Sometimes that's how right, like if you're close, I think it was late. Who said when they were
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:47.68 like in a gunfight and they were so close, they were re-helling at each other. Well, you could definitely
01:02:47.68 --> 01:02:54.96 hear people talking. Yeah. I saw I'll have to ask, like, what particular instance that was.
01:02:55.60 --> 01:03:02.32 Yeah, I saw a video on some fights, some army guys, I think in Afghanistan. They're kind,
01:03:02.32 --> 01:03:06.80 it looked like kind of a jungle. There's parts of Afghanistan that look like that. Yeah,
01:03:06.80 --> 01:03:11.68 like not a thick, but like it was like trees in there. And they were in a gunfight and they were,
01:03:11.68 --> 01:03:15.84 you could hear them yelling at it. And I think there isn't a different language and stuff.
01:03:15.84 --> 01:03:21.12 And they were just same deal. Blankety blank. And it's crazy because in football, yeah, that's how too.
01:03:21.12 --> 01:03:26.24 You know, it's like it's all talking trash the whole time. Even the referee is saying hey,
01:03:26.24 --> 01:03:30.32 be quiet, be quiet. No father, every is no factor because he can't do nothing for you. He's talking
01:03:30.32 --> 01:03:34.48 and everyone's yelling at each other. And depends, certain teams are more hostile than others,
01:03:34.48 --> 01:03:39.84 whatever. Just depends on the personality of the team. But yeah, that goes on. But it's all like
01:03:39.84 --> 01:03:46.96 it's all within like sportsmen like, you know, some of its funny, some of its like kind of,
01:03:46.96 --> 01:03:52.64 you know, so there's a sort of, it's kind of the culture, you know. But it's crazy to understand that
01:03:52.64 --> 01:03:57.84 like it's just trying to straighten it and you're trying to kill them. So that blankety blank
01:03:57.84 --> 01:04:06.24 blank is like the real deal, you know. Damn. This next section is about the commanding officer
01:04:06.24 --> 01:04:13.04 of the first battalion seventh regiment US Marines, first Marine Division. You might know who that is.
01:04:13.04 --> 01:04:21.68 It's Lieutenant Colonel Louis B. Polar from podcast. 111, we went through his book, which is called
01:04:21.68 --> 01:04:30.96 Marine in podcast 122. We talked about his son, Louis Polar Jr. So if you want to check out those
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:39.60 podcasts, there is a podcast that we'll stay with you. We'll put it to you that way.
01:04:42.80 --> 01:04:47.12 So what he says, this is one of the most, yeah, this is the most iconic Marine of all time.
01:04:48.16 --> 01:04:53.76 Chasty Polar. And he says, and this was kind of cool because it's like, this is,
01:04:55.20 --> 01:04:58.96 it's cool because the way this is written, you can tell that this guy was taken notes. Like,
01:04:58.96 --> 01:05:02.08 there was someone there sitting there writing down word for word, what these guys were saying. So
01:05:02.08 --> 01:05:06.72 this is Chasty Polar talking and he says, and handling my companies, I take the company commander's
01:05:06.72 --> 01:05:12.64 word for what is going on. You have to do this to get anywhere. In order to get a true picture of
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:19.68 what is going on in this heavy country, I take my staff, I make my staff get up to where the fighting
01:05:19.68 --> 01:05:25.20 is. This command post business will ruin the American army and Marines if it isn't watched.
01:05:25.20 --> 01:05:31.92 Hell, our platoons and squads would like a command post in the attack if they are not watched.
01:05:34.24 --> 01:05:38.000 As soon as you set up a command post, all forward movement stops.
01:05:42.08 --> 01:05:47.36 That's a good one. It's a good one to think about mentally for you, for us, for me.
01:05:48.40 --> 01:05:53.52 But when you soon as you set up a command post like, okay, I'm good, I'm good in this spot.
01:05:53.52 --> 01:05:57.12 I'm not forward progress stops. Don't do it.
01:05:59.28 --> 01:06:04.56 He says the walkie talkie that Japs have operates. Why can't we have a similar one?
01:06:07.36 --> 01:06:12.72 The menu says this to hell with the telephone wire advancing with the troops. We can't carry
01:06:12.72 --> 01:06:19.36 enough wire. We received an order. This advance, the advance will stop until the wire gets in.
01:06:19.36 --> 01:06:28.24 This is backwards. Because they didn't have good radio communications, they would run a wire
01:06:28.88 --> 01:06:33.12 an actual wire so they could talk to each other on these little field telephones.
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:38.96 Well, obviously it's not easy to run that wire out there. You've seen movies of guys. They got
01:06:38.96 --> 01:06:42.80 the little wire and a real run and out of waiting and getting shot. I mean, it's a don't nightmare.
01:06:43.20 --> 01:06:47.76 But then you get these commanders saying, hey, don't advance anymore until you get the wire position.
01:06:47.76 --> 01:06:55.44 And Chessi's like, look, we know where we're going. Let us go. He said this staffs are twice as
01:06:55.44 --> 01:07:00.08 large as they should be. The reds of metal staff is too large. I have five staff officers in the
01:07:00.08 --> 01:07:05.52 battalion and I could get along with less. The officers have to dress and look like the men.
01:07:06.56 --> 01:07:10.96 One time the commander of the Marine Corps asked me why our patrols failed in Haiti. I replied
01:07:10.96 --> 01:07:16.24 because the officer's bedding role. In Haiti at that time, the officer had to have a pack
01:07:16.24 --> 01:07:22.80 meal and the enlisted men saw the officers lying around in luxury. The patrols were actually
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:29.04 held up for this pack meal. Your leaders have to be upfront. Those that won't get up there
01:07:29.04 --> 01:07:34.000 and are not in physical shape to keep up with the men will cause plans to fail.
01:07:37.12 --> 01:07:43.60 It's okay to say that an outfit cannot be surprised. But it is bound to happen in this type of warfare.
01:07:43.60 --> 01:07:50.48 So, therefore, your outfits must know what to do when ambushed. So, he said like, hey, look,
01:07:50.48 --> 01:07:54.56 you can say, hey, we're not going to get surprised. But guess what? You are. So, you better know what to do.
01:07:55.84 --> 01:07:59.52 Then he says, calling back commanding officers to batowing in regimental
01:08:00.56 --> 01:08:05.28 CPs to say, how are things going? Is awful. That's his statement. That's a complete statement.
01:08:05.68 --> 01:08:10.88 If you call me back from the front line to say, how's that going? It's awful.
01:08:10.88 --> 01:08:17.92 Each company is responsible for its flank. This is a time tested and proven formation which worked.
01:08:17.92 --> 01:08:25.68 If attacked from the flank face and adjust, the good little thing to think about.
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.92 In marching or in camp, I just noticed like, now that I'm reading chesty puller, I'm getting
01:08:31.92 --> 01:08:39.44 more fired up. I'm channeling chesty. In marching or in camp, I think I'm doing what I think he
01:08:39.44 --> 01:08:47.28 sounded like. In marching or in camp, we've learned here that you must have an all-around defense.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.68 There you go. He's just making statements. He's not even, he's just, he's just rattling things off.
01:08:53.68 --> 01:08:58.08 We need more entrenching shovels. Give shovels to the men who have wire cutters. You need both
01:08:58.08 --> 01:09:05.04 wire cutter and shovels. I wish we had the M1 rifle and when we get relieved from Guadalcanal,
01:09:05.04 --> 01:09:14.16 I'm going to make every effort to get it. I consider it my imperative that the army and marines
01:09:14.16 --> 01:09:19.92 be equipped with knee mortars and only carry one type grenade. Have the hand grenade fit in the knee
01:09:19.92 --> 01:09:25.04 mortar and be of use as a hand grenade and also as a rifle grenade. You need a rifle grenade
01:09:25.04 --> 01:09:33.04 or an east squad for uses against enemy machine gunness. I didn't, in some of the other guys, I
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:38.000 kind of skip through some of their when it gets starts getting real granular, but I wasn't
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000 going to skip Chastipolar because Chastipolar. The following is the result and the so that's it.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.12 That's what we get from Chastipolar. But then the following is the result of a conference with five
01:09:51.12 --> 01:09:57.04 of the best NCOs in the first battalion of the seventh marines. These NCOs were selected by Lieutenant
01:09:57.04 --> 01:10:02.72 Colonel, Polar. Here's some comments from them. The Japanese fire is not always aimed. It is
01:10:02.72 --> 01:10:08.24 harassing fire and scares recruits. Get the recruits so they are used to overhead fire.
01:10:08.24 --> 01:10:13.68 Japs who have infiltrated signal to each other with their rifles by the number of shots.
01:10:16.16 --> 01:10:23.60 We get these birds by constantly patrolling. He says if one of the guys say,
01:10:24.72 --> 01:10:29.44 if you shoot their officers, they mill around talking about the Japanese. If you shoot their officers,
01:10:29.44 --> 01:10:35.76 they mill around their NCOs or poor. You can tell their officers by their sabers and their letter
01:10:35.76 --> 01:10:42.56 leather patees, which is like some kind of legging. I had to look that word up. Platees, PUTT, EES.
01:10:43.60 --> 01:10:48.64 It's like a legging. But this is again, this is something that you hear a lot about the Japanese.
01:10:48.64 --> 01:10:54.16 Is that once their officers are dead, they because they're very centralized command, micro
01:10:54.16 --> 01:10:59.84 managed. So if you killed their officers, all of a sudden the rest of the troops are just kind of
01:10:59.84 --> 01:11:08.96 milling around. They don't know what to do. Lieutenant Shepherd 7th Marines also promoted on the
01:11:08.96 --> 01:11:17.04 field of battle. We salute you Lieutenant Shepherd. I would stress in training teamwork between
01:11:17.04 --> 01:11:21.12 the leaders and all units. Leaize on between support plans and all leaders. Leaize on between
01:11:21.12 --> 01:11:25.76 artillery and the infantry. If I were training my unit again, I would really have some high class
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:30.72 patrol training. I would do everything with these patrols. I could possibly think of to include
01:11:30.72 --> 01:11:38.08 losing them and making them go across country without maps or compasses. The Japanese do a lot of
01:11:38.08 --> 01:11:44.24 yelling at times and at other times they are deadly silent. One night, some Japanese got in our
01:11:44.24 --> 01:11:52.64 marching column. We discovered them and bayoneted them. At another time, I heard I myself heard
01:11:52.64 --> 01:12:00.96 a Japanese yell in good English, K company, forward. The japs don't like our men yelling back at them.
01:12:04.64 --> 01:12:09.76 Okay, next week at two, Master Gunnery Sergeant R. M. foul 7th Marines and he's 24 years
01:12:09.76 --> 01:12:15.36 of service. He said, we've learned not to get excited or go off half-cocked where there's noise.
01:12:15.36 --> 01:12:22.08 The Japanese make noise to mislead us. They shot off some firecrackers at the start, but we have
01:12:22.08 --> 01:12:28.96 learned that where the noise is, he ain't. You never hear a move. He sleeps in the daytime and
01:12:28.96 --> 01:12:38.08 does his work at night. Officer's an NCOs during shelling should move around and talk to the men.
01:12:38.08 --> 01:12:43.76 Quiet them down. If you don't do this, some of them will walk around with their fingers on their
01:12:43.76 --> 01:12:51.20 triggers and they get to imagining things. And along this line, we learned to post double sentinels,
01:12:51.20 --> 01:12:57.60 one man to quiet another. Sheesh. Imagine that. You got to put two people on watch because you
01:12:57.60 --> 01:13:05.60 got one of them's going to freak out. All my time in the Marines, I've seen men bunch up.
01:13:05.60 --> 01:13:11.76 And I've talked about this and make my NCOs talk about this all the time. The men seem to
01:13:11.76 --> 01:13:14.48 fear separation. I talked about that in leadership strategy in chat. They said, I don't
01:13:14.48 --> 01:13:20.000 hold section called don't bunch up. And I don't didn't just talk about it from the battlefield
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.72 perspective, but what happens is the way I, the reason I had to talk about it in there is because
01:13:24.72 --> 01:13:29.60 yes, people bunch up on the battlefield and they do it because they're afraid. And because you want
01:13:29.60 --> 01:13:33.12 to hear, you want to be close. I want to get to you to hear what you have. What's going on?
01:13:33.12 --> 01:13:42.56 What happened from a leadership perspective is people bunch up mentally from the lead. So echo,
01:13:42.56 --> 01:13:46.56 you have an idea. I like to crowd in with your idea and put my ideas in there. We want to get together.
01:13:46.56 --> 01:13:51.20 We want to talk. We're going to give our input. It's like, man, give that person some space.
01:13:52.80 --> 01:13:56.000 Let that plan develop a little bit. Don't bunch up. Don't crowd it.
01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:06.96 This one says the Japs are man monkeys and they run around considerable. In order to compete with
01:14:06.96 --> 01:14:13.60 these man monkeys from Japan, you got to be an excellent shape and you've got to be tough. We can
01:14:13.60 --> 01:14:19.44 lick them and we are doing it all the time. So yeah, we say and they're like in great shape and they're
01:14:19.44 --> 01:14:24.24 able to move around through the jungle very quickly. Well, I suppose it's like when when Joe
01:14:24.24 --> 01:14:32.48 Rogan calls some fighter like a gorilla or whatever, right? Yeah, or a monster. Yeah, monster animal.
01:14:32.48 --> 01:14:40.80 Yeah, because the animal. Check man monkeys. Lieutenant Colonel Frisbee, executive officer
01:14:40.80 --> 01:14:49.28 seventh Marines. I hope the army is being toughened up. We toughened up by bivowacking, not camping
01:14:49.28 --> 01:14:54.88 at the combat ranges. We lived at these combat ranges in order to teach platoon to keep off the road.
01:14:54.88 --> 01:15:01.20 We made platoon's march in the field alongside the road when they moved from one combat area to another.
01:15:01.92 --> 01:15:13.20 Hey, what's bivowacking? Sleeping in the woods? Not camping, but you know, setting up a small area
01:15:13.20 --> 01:15:20.32 to sleep in. You're not like put pitching attend. It's like a just a make shift sort of
01:15:20.32 --> 01:15:25.52 we're going to sleep here. Good for you. Not even a camp, like less. So just kind of firstly
01:15:25.52 --> 01:15:31.92 been for rest. Yeah. It's not like in a bad way or necessarily good way, just like to get sleep.
01:15:31.92 --> 01:15:34.96 Like hey, we've been patrolling. All right, we're in a good spot. Hey, we're going to be vowackier
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:40.24 for the night. Okay, you know, half guys on security, other half guys get, you know, put your head down.
01:15:40.24 --> 01:15:44.96 Get some sleep. Yeah. It's probably a good defensive old position.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:57.92 Here's Lieutenant Colonel N. H. Han Khan. Second battalion, seven therines, and by the way,
01:15:57.92 --> 01:16:06.64 metal of honor from Haiti. It pays in the attack in the jungle to use the heavy machine guns.
01:16:06.64 --> 01:16:12.72 There is a difference of opinion as you've noticed on this matter. It's hard work. Yes, but don't
01:16:12.72 --> 01:16:19.04 overlook the value. Moral and otherwise, and don't forget about the high rate of fire. If you did
01:16:19.04 --> 01:16:24.64 to heavy machine guns and substitute the lights in their place, you must remember that you will be
01:16:24.64 --> 01:16:34.16 up against the Japanese machine guns. As we all know, a huge fan of machine guns. Yeah. And apparently
01:16:34.16 --> 01:16:39.76 so is Lieutenant Colonel. Be careful about withdrawing the men unless all the men know what it's
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:43.04 about. If you don't do this, you're level to make the men panicky. We already talked about that.
01:16:43.84 --> 01:16:49.12 Mob mentality can happen. You must realize that there is such a thing as not attacking win
01:16:49.12 --> 01:16:58.24 order to do so. We have got to get to a point where the men go ahead, win order and damn the
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:05.04 highing the most. Corpals must be indoctrinated with leadership to overcome this and all ranks
01:17:05.04 --> 01:17:13.12 have got to have the hate. Like I said, this is a different time, man. You're going against a different
01:17:13.12 --> 01:17:20.16 enemy. So we're talking about you have to hate the enemy. That's where we're at.
01:17:20.16 --> 01:17:30.32 There's a conference with three second lieutenant and five old NCOs of second to tie in
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:35.36 seventh Marines. The basic principle of leadership in the US Marine Corps is that the individual
01:17:35.36 --> 01:17:39.12 is told of his responsibility in different situations and is held to it.
01:17:43.20 --> 01:17:47.68 You got to have confidence in each other. When signals to move forward are given, you must have
01:17:47.68 --> 01:17:51.92 confidence that the men next to you will move forward even if you cannot see them.
01:17:53.28 --> 01:17:56.000 We have that kind of confidence in this battalion.
01:17:59.12 --> 01:18:06.24 There's a quote here which I am in full agreement with. It says, we love the heavy machine gun
01:18:06.24 --> 01:18:17.04 period. We have two American Indians. We use as talkers on the telephone or voice radio when we
01:18:17.04 --> 01:18:24.72 want to transmit secret or important messages. It's awesome. Be mean and kill them.
01:18:25.60 --> 01:18:31.28 Kill them dead are platoon. Our motto in this platoon is no prisoners.
01:18:37.76 --> 01:18:44.72 Second lieutenant, D.A. Clark, seventh Marines. Promoted on the field of battle. This officer
01:18:44.72 --> 01:18:50.56 was interviewed in the hospital where he was recuperating from wounds. We have a lot of trouble in my
01:18:50.56 --> 01:18:55.84 platoon with water discipline. We also have trouble with men bunching up in order to talk to each other.
01:18:55.84 --> 01:18:57.92 They seem to do this even though it means death.
01:19:02.80 --> 01:19:11.52 Major abuse assistant G3 on the general vandagriff staff. We have had to multiply our unit of fire
01:19:11.52 --> 01:19:19.28 in hand grenades by five. The yellow color on hand grenades is poor. Why can't they just be painted
01:19:19.28 --> 01:19:25.28 black as the yellow color enables the japs or throw them back? You ever seen that color combination?
01:19:27.12 --> 01:19:32.48 It's in a very very common in the military. It's like an olive drab, but then the writing is
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:35.84 in yellow. And like even the grades, no one listen to this guy because the grenade still have
01:19:35.84 --> 01:19:41.12 like a yellow band around them. It's not like a bright yellow, but it's definitely yellow.
01:19:43.52 --> 01:19:49.04 Wait, why is that? Why is it yellow? That's just how they mark them. I mean, there's no particular
01:19:49.04 --> 01:19:55.04 reason. It looks kind of dope. I almost actually leadership strategy and tactics. Almost went.
01:19:55.04 --> 01:20:01.92 In fact, the reason I didn't go because it's olive drab, the reason I didn't go that same exact yellow
01:20:01.92 --> 01:20:06.96 is because you couldn't really read it clearly enough. That's kind of a bummer. I should have just stuck with it.
01:20:06.96 --> 01:20:09.76 Yeah, like claim more my declaim or my third yellow.
01:20:09.76 --> 01:20:14.08 Back where it says front towards enemy? Yeah, actually. Yeah yellow. I think. Yeah.
01:20:15.28 --> 01:20:20.96 Yeah, so it's very good. It's the common thing. It's the common stencil color is this olive drab green
01:20:20.96 --> 01:20:31.60 and it's a faded yellow. It's like a drab yellow. Yeah. Just. He says this. I am being sent back
01:20:31.60 --> 01:20:37.44 for arrest. We have been in action continually here from August 7, 1942 until this date,
01:20:37.44 --> 01:20:44.72 November 26, 1942. What we all marvel at is how general vandagrift can stand it so much better than
01:20:44.72 --> 01:20:53.20 we do. It must be his character. I want to do like a full-on podcast on general vandagrift.
01:20:53.20 --> 01:21:04.56 Major Ben J. Northridge, CO2, but I am 164th Infantry. If I could train my men over again,
01:21:04.56 --> 01:21:10.64 I would put officers and men in slit trenches and drop bombs nearby to overcome fear.
01:21:11.60 --> 01:21:16.24 We were all scared to death at first. Let's overcome this fear. How about firing some
01:21:16.24 --> 01:21:21.84 captured 25 caliber ammunition out of captured rifles to let officers and men know the sound?
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:26.88 Also captured job machine guns ammunition out of their captured machine guns.
01:21:28.08 --> 01:21:34.08 Gotta get used to that sound. Luckily we do. Luckily we have AK47s. We can do that. No problem.
01:21:34.08 --> 01:21:39.76 No factor. We know what that AK sounds like. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Richards, CEO, first
01:21:39.76 --> 01:21:46.80 battalion 164th Infantry. He says, if I were training my battalion again, I would have training
01:21:46.80 --> 01:21:55.92 in patience. I would have patrols wait for the enemy to expose himself. They move around too.
01:21:55.92 --> 01:22:01.84 They have to relieve themselves and they have to get food. I would have the men in this patient's
01:22:01.84 --> 01:22:06.32 training made be made to sit still for hours at a time.
01:22:06.32 --> 01:22:22.000 Captain John A. Gosset, CEO, company H, 164th Infantry. Teach the men the capacities of the hand grenade
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.16 and handling men. Isn't that crazy, dude? This guy is here in Guadalcanal and here's the two
01:22:30.16 --> 01:22:34.96 notes that he's got. He said, you got to learn the capacities of hand grenades and have a handle
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:41.36 men. I thought I knew how to handle men, but since I've been here, I have revised my ideas as I have
01:22:41.36 --> 01:22:48.48 learned a great deal. I have learned the primitive rough and tumble way. You can't pat all men on the
01:22:48.48 --> 01:22:54.32 back. You have to be rough with some men in order to get results. It is not my nature to be rough,
01:22:54.32 --> 01:23:00.16 but I am forcing myself and I have learned which of my men I can pat on the back and which I
01:23:00.16 --> 01:23:11.12 have to deal with in the hardest manner. Everyone's the same, everyone's different. Captain John A.
01:23:11.12 --> 01:23:19.12 Dawson, commanding officer, company B. 164th Infantry. If I could train my company again,
01:23:19.12 --> 01:23:25.12 I would have some maneuvers on which the men were deprived of food, water, and comforts in order
01:23:25.12 --> 01:23:31.68 to find out which NCOs and men can't take it. I would relieve these people. This type of maneuver
01:23:31.68 --> 01:23:37.04 would teach men to know and expect hardships. It will lessen the shock when they come up against
01:23:37.04 --> 01:23:44.88 the real thing in the presence of the enemy. It is important that the entire squad note
01:23:44.88 --> 01:23:50.88 know how to operate the BAR, not just two men, reason, think of the BAR men who are wounded,
01:23:50.88 --> 01:24:00.64 get killed and become sick and have to be evacuated. We've tenant John S. Graves,
01:24:00.64 --> 01:24:06.48 Platoon Leader, company C. 164th Infantry. The biggest thing I have learned since I hit this island
01:24:06.48 --> 01:24:11.84 is that leadership and initiative is so important here. The Platoon Leader can only be in one spot
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:22.88 at a time and men must be trained to act correctly on their own. I've never seen this type of training.
01:24:22.88 --> 01:24:38.56 Yes, decentralized command. That's just post that on your brain. Sergeant W. V. Demos, squad leader,
01:24:38.56 --> 01:24:44.16 company C. 164th Infantry. Sir, I would like to say that there is no place for recruits here.
01:24:44.72 --> 01:24:50.48 We need trained soldiers who have initiative and know what is the right thing to do.
01:24:51.52 --> 01:24:57.12 The jungle is so thick that squad leaders cannot get around all of the time to see men and tell
01:24:57.12 --> 01:25:08.000 them what to do. This is the common theme. This is Colonel B. E. Moore, commanding officer 164th
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.44 Infantry. Note, when I saw Colonel Moore, he was interviewing a patrol and patrol leader who had
01:25:13.44 --> 01:25:18.88 just come back. They had been on a reconnaissance for 15 hours. The patrol leader had been met
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:26.32 at an advanced position and as he had valuable information of the enemy, he was conducted by
01:25:26.32 --> 01:25:31.92 Jeep to the observation post of the artillery where he directed artillery fire. Then returned to
01:25:31.92 --> 01:25:36.64 the Colonel where he made his report. The patrol and its leader were nearly exhausted.
01:25:36.64 --> 01:25:46.08 Colonel Moore had on hand a small sample bottle of brandy which he issued one small sample
01:25:46.08 --> 01:25:52.96 bottle to each two men. He made them dilute this brandy with water in their canteen cups.
01:25:52.96 --> 01:25:59.04 It was noticeable that this helped them. The following interview took place after the patrol had
01:25:59.04 --> 01:26:06.56 been dismissed. One could not be around Colonel Moore very long without realizing that he
01:26:06.56 --> 01:26:15.84 is a leader and regimental commander in every sense of the word. Taking care of his people.
01:26:19.76 --> 01:26:27.28 When he says, the greatest problem is leaders and you have to find some way to weed out the week ones.
01:26:28.08 --> 01:26:34.24 The patrol tuners who cannot command, who cannot force things and you cannot act on the spur of
01:26:34.24 --> 01:26:42.24 the moment in an emergency are a distinct detriment. Leadership.
01:26:44.32 --> 01:26:51.28 This is the last thing we're going to read from this book. He says, many of the junior leaders
01:26:51.28 --> 01:26:57.76 have not used their heads at times and they're training. I recommend you put them up against
01:26:57.76 --> 01:27:06.56 situations where they must use their heads. He says, the good leaders seem to get killed.
01:27:06.56 --> 01:27:12.16 The poor leaders get the men killed. The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:18.88 on the right people. Not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in the jungle. If you can find out who
01:27:18.88 --> 01:27:22.80 the good patrol leaders are before you hit the combat zone, you have found out something.
01:27:22.80 --> 01:27:30.96 I have had to get rid of about 25 officers because they just weren't leaders. I had to make
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:36.80 the battalion commander weed out the poor junior leaders. This process is continuous. Our junior
01:27:36.80 --> 01:27:56.08 leaders are finding out that they must know more about their men. The good leaders know their men.
01:27:56.08 --> 01:28:03.68 Obviously, that's not new. We've heard it before. In fact, we've heard all this before.
01:28:03.68 --> 01:28:11.92 What's crazy is they'd all heard it before. Right? These principles have been around.
01:28:12.88 --> 01:28:18.80 These principles have been around forever. They still had to re-learn those lessons
01:28:18.80 --> 01:28:26.80 and they still had to make every effort like this manual to pass those lessons on.
01:28:26.80 --> 01:28:37.28 What should we do? Well, what we should do is we should make our best effort
01:28:38.40 --> 01:28:47.68 to receive those lessons. Remember those lessons just as we should remember these brave men
01:28:47.68 --> 01:28:58.16 who learn these lessons in blood. What do you got echoed, Charles?
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:06.88 I always, like, so there's kind of two ways you can go with all of this stuff where it's like
01:29:06.88 --> 01:29:11.84 you hear it over and over and over again, right? Which should sort of reinforce it. So you kind of
01:29:11.84 --> 01:29:19.04 got to be careful to not regard it. I guess maybe this happens subconsciously sometimes. Where you
01:29:19.04 --> 01:29:23.28 just, you know, you hear something over and over again and then it just becomes sort of just noise like
01:29:23.28 --> 01:29:29.84 already know that. You know what's weird about me? Yeah, I know a lot of things.
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:35.44 When you say that, like, I can't relate to it because every time I hear these things,
01:29:35.44 --> 01:29:40.72 I'm like, there it is. I'm like, there it is. It's a reinforcement. It's a, it's a, it's a hearing
01:29:40.72 --> 01:29:44.72 to get it. It's a little bit of different thing about I know what that means. You know, like that
01:29:44.72 --> 01:29:50.16 last little section is so crazy to read that. It's so crazy to read that. This guy is saying,
01:29:50.16 --> 01:29:54.72 in training you, I recommend you put them in situations where they must use their heads.
01:29:55.28 --> 01:29:58.000 Like, I teach that all the time. That's long front. We're like, oh, you want to train your
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.08 leaders. You got to put, you can't give your leaders problems that there is a wrote,
01:30:02.08 --> 01:30:08.80 member, memorable solution to. You actually want to make them think. I always bring up a story with
01:30:08.80 --> 01:30:15.68 the Germans. The Germans would give their subordinate leaders in training. They would give them
01:30:15.68 --> 01:30:21.44 problems that could only be solved if they broke the rules, which means there's no format to
01:30:21.44 --> 01:30:26.24 what they're getting them to try and do. So how can you get your people? You need to put your
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:29.60 people in situations where they need to think. So every time I look, and this is a lesson that I've
01:30:29.60 --> 01:30:35.60 taught before, but I hear it. I'm like, there it is. Yeah, maybe because you like, apply it,
01:30:35.60 --> 01:30:41.20 it may be often or maybe it made such an impact for because of your experiences and stuff,
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:46.88 or maybe both, I don't know. But so it's always sticking with you. So you're always looking
01:30:46.88 --> 01:30:52.48 to like, reinforce, to make it better to improve on this very thing that you're actually practicing.
01:30:52.48 --> 01:30:57.68 Yeah, you know what's interesting? So my last three years in the terms, I was running that training.
01:30:57.68 --> 01:31:05.28 So I got to see, and I always say that the training that I ran was the best leadership laboratory
01:31:05.28 --> 01:31:09.36 in the history of the world. And I would be willing to go toe to toe and anyone that thinks that
01:31:09.36 --> 01:31:12.48 they've seen them better. I'm not not not to fight them, but I would be interested
01:31:13.52 --> 01:31:18.96 if there was someone else that says, oh, we did, we had a leadership situation where this is what
01:31:18.96 --> 01:31:25.12 we got to see. And therefore we have a really good understanding of leadership as well. I'm sure
01:31:25.12 --> 01:31:30.72 there's other things that are out there. I'm telling you, when I was running that training,
01:31:30.72 --> 01:31:37.36 it was freaking awesome. Because you're seeing platoon after platoon after platoon, after platoon,
01:31:37.36 --> 01:31:41.60 with different leadership, you could see the good leadership versus the bad leadership. You see what
01:31:41.60 --> 01:31:48.48 work, what didn't work, it was the best leadership laboratory. And I learned, if I got to take the
01:31:48.48 --> 01:31:54.32 lessons that I learned and see them applied. And when they applied them well, the things would go,
01:31:54.32 --> 01:31:59.20 well, if they didn't apply well, things would go bad. So obvious. It was so obvious. And what's
01:31:59.20 --> 01:32:06.08 interesting is now at Esslope Front, I kind of get to do the same thing because it's, hey,
01:32:06.08 --> 01:32:09.36 I work with the business. Here's what's happening in their market. Here's what's happening in
01:32:09.36 --> 01:32:13.28 their expansion. Here's what's happening as they grow. So we get to see, oh, here's the leadership.
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.32 Here's what you need to do. And then I, it's like, this is what the mistake that you're making.
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:24.40 This is where you need to move. And so I like you said, I'm very lucky because I continue to get
01:32:24.40 --> 01:32:35.04 to work directly in this environment that I've been completely and utterly engaged in for, you know,
01:32:35.04 --> 01:32:42.80 I mean, for a long, long, for decades. And yet, that I guess maybe that's why when I see these things,
01:32:44.24 --> 01:32:50.48 I think to myself, like, guess, like, I get, it just, just more reinforcement.
01:32:50.48 --> 01:32:59.92 And yeah, so you like it. What? Like straight out, like, okay, so we'll call this, maybe over
01:32:59.92 --> 01:33:05.84 simplifying it, leadership, right? Do I like it? Yeah. Are you serious, right? I mean,
01:33:05.84 --> 01:33:10.000 I absolutely love it. Okay. I love it. And you know what? I love it in the way that
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:21.04 what I love about it is it is a continual challenge to it's, it's solving a problem and getting the
01:33:21.04 --> 01:33:24.88 grad. It's kind of like jujitsu in that you get out there, you learn to move, you see,
01:33:24.88 --> 01:33:30.40 move, you use the move, it works, it doesn't work, you make adjustments on it. It's a very similar
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:39.04 thing. But yeah, I love it because it's super complex and yet it's super simple, right?
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:51.04 And the gratification is extraordinary because people, you know, like people say, I did what you
01:33:51.04 --> 01:33:55.84 just told me to do, you know, I didn't last meeting and Fred's on board now and you're like,
01:33:55.84 --> 01:34:03.92 that's awesome. And this was a problem for someone that was a legitimate, not just a challenge,
01:34:03.92 --> 01:34:09.92 but like a threat to their lifestyle, right? A threat to their business, a threat to their corporation.
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:15.44 And you're like, hey, here's this, here's, okay, do this, report back. Let me hear what you got.
01:34:15.44 --> 01:34:19.28 Okay, here's the report. Okay, here's the reaction. Okay, good. That means continuing moving this
01:34:19.28 --> 01:34:24.80 round. No, that means going over in this direction. So to be able to be lucky enough
01:34:25.60 --> 01:34:32.32 to take all these lessons that I learned and be able to apply them on a daily basis,
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:38.48 it's ridiculous. It's freaking awesome because like it's, do you like leadership? Well, I
01:34:38.48 --> 01:34:45.84 knew the answer and maybe it was kind of a semi-retortical question, but if, because some people
01:34:45.84 --> 01:34:50.40 they don't, they don't like it. They see it as an necessity and stuff like that, but they don't
01:34:50.40 --> 01:34:55.44 really like it. So and then it's a spectrum for sure. It's like sales, you know, like sales, for
01:34:55.44 --> 01:35:00.88 example, where some people, they just love it and every little tip, every little thing, every little
01:35:00.88 --> 01:35:07.92 like established, like element of successful state, they're all about it. No, people can be in all
01:35:07.92 --> 01:35:14.48 kinds of stuff. Yeah, you did too. Guitar, drawing, or reading. I mean, yeah, so if there is a certain
01:35:14.48 --> 01:35:20.48 philosophical element that is like with stud to test the time and the reading here reading
01:35:20.48 --> 01:35:24.64 there is a man, it's going to reinforce a thing. They're going to be into it and it's going to
01:35:24.64 --> 01:35:28.72 be just in their head. They're going to apply it any chance that they get, even if it's this
01:35:28.72 --> 01:35:33.60 much of a little development, they're going to apply it. Boom, it's ready. It's down because they
01:35:33.60 --> 01:35:39.36 enjoy it and that's part of their jam. But if, let's say you don't really like it, it's like a
01:35:39.36 --> 01:35:44.32 chore or whatever, right? You know, there's certain, in tight, there are introvert type people who are
01:35:44.32 --> 01:35:48.000 in a leadership position who kind of don't like it. They'd rather someone else do it with a
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.56 people or something like this, right? Sure. And then so those are the ones that might be, I don't know,
01:35:54.56 --> 01:35:58.72 but they might be the ones that are going to be making these mistakes over and over again because
01:35:58.72 --> 01:36:04.40 they're not consciously actively trying to implement these lessons that are just in someone like
01:36:04.40 --> 01:36:09.52 your case, just straight up being reinforced. But for them, it's almost like not even getting
01:36:09.52 --> 01:36:12.72 it. It's kind of like, I heard that before, whatever, I heard that before, whatever, I'm too busy,
01:36:12.72 --> 01:36:16.64 like not caring almost in a way, like I'm too busy like caring about the things that I care
01:36:16.64 --> 01:36:21.60 about and like. Yeah, I think I think where, oh, there's a lot of misconceptions and I wrote
01:36:21.60 --> 01:36:28.56 about this and leadership strategy in tactics. But here, it's all like the cover flap or whatever.
01:36:32.24 --> 01:36:37.92 Leadership is the most challenging of human endeavors. It is often misunderstood. It can be
01:36:37.92 --> 01:36:43.76 bewildered, mystified, and frustrated, even the most dedicated practitioners. Leaders at all levels
01:36:43.76 --> 01:36:50.56 are often forced to use theoretical guesswork to make decisions and be their troops. It doesn't
01:36:50.56 --> 01:36:56.24 have to be that way. There are principles that can be applied and tenants that can be followed.
01:36:56.24 --> 01:37:01.04 There are skills that can be learned and maneuvers that can be practiced and executed.
01:37:01.04 --> 01:37:06.56 There are leadership strategies and tactics that have been tested and proven on the battlefield
01:37:06.56 --> 01:37:12.16 in business and in life. So that's what I think people miss out on. Is they miss out on the fact
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:23.92 that it's kind of like any skillset that you want to learn. You want to learn how to play guitar.
01:37:23.92 --> 01:37:28.16 You've got to learn the chords. You've got to learn notes. You want to learn GJT or you've got to
01:37:28.16 --> 01:37:32.000 learn an on-walk. You've got to learn how to play basketball. You've got to learn how to triple.
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.36 You couldn't expect, why would anybody expect that they could walk out on a basketball court
01:37:35.36 --> 01:37:45.28 without ever practicing and be good at it? Now let me ask you this. Have you ever watched
01:37:43.68 --> 01:37:51.44 some like a skate border or a BMX guy or a mountain biker or a surfer and been like,
01:37:51.44 --> 01:37:55.28 oh that looks you think in your weird mind that you could actually do what they're doing.
01:37:55.28 --> 01:38:00.96 That's not the skateboarding guys, but yeah the other guys are crazy.
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:07.28 But you think oh like oh I can see myself doing that. So I think people look at leadership sometimes
01:38:07.28 --> 01:38:11.84 and there's things that are happening. Oh yeah I would do the same thing or whatever. It looks
01:38:11.84 --> 01:38:18.24 easier than it is. Yeah. And so you have to be careful of that. And maybe that's why I continue
01:38:18.24 --> 01:38:26.48 to enjoy reading and learning about it because I see how hard it is. I see every day when a
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:31.68 challenge it is for people. So if I can take one thing away from a book that I can use as a tool
01:38:31.68 --> 01:38:38.000 to help someone else maneuver through a challenging leadership situation, I love it. I love adding
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:47.36 that capability. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense to me. So speaking of learning and improving and getting
01:38:47.36 --> 01:38:54.72 better. What other suggestions might you have for us? Mr. Yeah kind of like me.
01:38:54.72 --> 01:39:02.08 Echo. Zane. Charles. Kind of like me saying hey exercise will help they improve every other
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:06.72 aspect of your life. True. Unlike any other thing or whatever. True. True. No that thing. Sure
01:39:06.72 --> 01:39:14.16 I'll say it over and over again or whatever helps reinforce it. Hopefully it doesn't become noise.
01:39:14.16 --> 01:39:21.12 I'll give you some credit now for taking what I just said which is a pretty meaning for moment.
01:39:21.12 --> 01:39:25.20 And what you just said is you're going to continue to read the same stuff over and over again on the
01:39:25.20 --> 01:39:29.44 support section of the podcast. What's good for the goose is good for the.
01:39:29.44 --> 01:39:34.64 The guy on the show what I'm saying anyway we're working out. That's going to improve your life.
01:39:34.64 --> 01:39:37.92 Hmm. Health. What if you just tried to say things in a different way sometime?
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:43.68 Like maybe people would be more interested in it. It's possible.
01:39:43.68 --> 01:39:50.24 It's possible. Unless we are still working out regardless. I always say it. Yeah. I worked out
01:39:50.24 --> 01:40:00.000 today. It's bots. What? Oh. Good job. I had plups today. Yeah. By the way, we're in the process of the
01:40:00.80 --> 01:40:07.76 let's call it the new garage gym of justice. We are probably two months out. Maybe right now. So
01:40:07.76 --> 01:40:14.80 we're getting there. Yeah. If anybody, if anybody, you know, maybe a year and a half ago,
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:20.88 there was a transition where I was, I moved into a temporary holding facility for myself.
01:40:20.88 --> 01:40:29.20 So that meant a temporary workout facility in my home. And that was all a strategic move
01:40:30.08 --> 01:40:36.40 to long-term and have a much better sort of facility facility.
01:40:36.40 --> 01:40:42.32 Yes. So we're getting there. I'm looking forward to unveiling that. I might even do, you know,
01:40:42.32 --> 01:40:46.64 the, I'll get people as I say, hey, show us your gym tour. Like gym tour.
01:40:46.64 --> 01:40:54.000 Really? Well, I'll say what. I will, when I, when the new gym is complete or at least like when
01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:00.56 it's kind of getting close, we'll do a little, we'll do a little facility tour. Yeah. So you're
01:41:00.56 --> 01:41:10.08 thinking, so what are you going to do? Or you're saying a month or two months. Maybe two and a half.
01:41:10.08 --> 01:41:13.60 No, maybe two. We should, we're getting there. We're getting close. There you go.
01:41:13.60 --> 01:41:17.52 We're getting close. So improvements across the board. Straight up facilities,
01:41:18.40 --> 01:41:22.64 personal health, all that stuff. That's good for it. So we're looking for as one. We're going
01:41:22.64 --> 01:41:28.08 for anyway. We've got supplements for you. If you need them, which, you know, need, you know,
01:41:28.08 --> 01:41:34.64 that's a spectrum, but this thing will 100% help you. Yeah. I'm going to go and say that you
01:41:34.64 --> 01:41:41.28 pro, you need. You need to get joint warfare and acrylic oil. For sure. Yeah. I'm not sure of it.
01:41:41.28 --> 01:41:44.96 Well, if you're listening to this podcast, which means you're getting after it. Right. Okay.
01:41:44.96 --> 01:41:50.32 If you're not listening to this, which we don't care, you're, you then you don't need it. Right.
01:41:50.32 --> 01:41:53.92 Sure. You legitimately don't, because you're like on your own program. You're probably watching TV.
01:41:53.92 --> 01:41:59.44 You don't need joint warfare and superkill if you're, to, to, to strengthen your thumb to press
01:41:59.44 --> 01:42:03.84 the remote control. You're not little bit different. Yeah. You, you can just get whatever.
01:42:03.84 --> 01:42:09.20 More, more french fries, more cheetos. That's what you can get. If you're in the game,
01:42:09.20 --> 01:42:15.68 you may want to get superkill, you may want. Yeah. You should, you need to get superkill.
01:42:15.68 --> 01:42:19.76 You need to get to it. Warfare. And the reason I say need is because if you don't take it,
01:42:19.76 --> 01:42:26.96 you have issues. That's it. Don't just get, get away from the issues. Yeah. Yeah. It's like one of
01:42:26.96 --> 01:42:30.32 those things like you ever play a, uh, you played soccer before. Yeah. All right. So,
01:42:30.32 --> 01:42:34.88 you're a baseball football, right? You, you wear a certain kind of shoes. Go on. Cleats. Really?
01:42:34.88 --> 01:42:40.80 Cleats. So, when you, when you go play, when you suit up, you put on your cleats. Yeah.
01:42:40.80 --> 01:42:44.96 You don't put on tennis shoes. No. I mean, look, is it possible to put on tennis shoes?
01:42:45.60 --> 01:42:48.000 Do you need cleat? That's the thing. Do you need cleats?
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.40 Depends on what you mean by me, right? Exactly. And that's exactly what I'm saying. Okay.
01:42:52.40 --> 01:42:58.24 So, clarification accepted. Look, if you want to stay on this path and not worry about your
01:42:58.24 --> 01:43:03.36 joints giving out on you and they can. Oh, they can get it. Give out on you for sure. They can
01:43:03.36 --> 01:43:08.80 bother you. Ack. They can ache when you're not even exercising straight up. They can. But if you don't
01:43:08.80 --> 01:43:12.56 want to worry about that kind of stuff, that's when you take the joint warfare in the superkill,
01:43:12.56 --> 01:43:18.48 100%. It's taking every day. Like I do every single day. So far, since our last talk.
01:43:18.48 --> 01:43:26.16 Anyway, glad you've tightened it up. Yes, sir. Also, discipline and discipline go kind of the same thing,
01:43:26.16 --> 01:43:31.52 just different delivery, different modalities and delivery. Yes, sir. Big time. So, yeah.
01:43:32.56 --> 01:43:36.32 You know, the powder, there's the powder, there's the pill, there's the energy drink. I'm just
01:43:36.32 --> 01:43:42.72 call it energy drink. Healthy energy drink. Even though it's barely related to the common,
01:43:43.84 --> 01:43:48.72 what's commonly considered an energy drink. Right. When I think of energy drink, I think, oh,
01:43:48.72 --> 01:43:53.84 massive amount of sugar, massive amount of caffeine, massive amount of chemicals to keep it
01:43:53.84 --> 01:43:59.20 from going, getting spoiled. That's what I think of when I think of an energy drink. And I think of
01:43:59.20 --> 01:44:07.28 a pink orange and yellow can. That it's in. Yeah. That's what I think of. So that's an energy drink.
01:44:07.28 --> 01:44:16.80 Now, it is a very strange to say that what we have, which has no sugar, it's sweetened with monk fruit.
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:23.44 It's got 95 milligrams of caffeine. So it's got caffeine in it, but that's the same as a
01:44:23.44 --> 01:44:28.32 cup of coffee. It's not some crazy amount that gets you all psycho, jittery. And you have a bit
01:44:28.32 --> 01:44:34.56 crash from. And there's no preservatives in it because we pasteurize it. So what we're really talking
01:44:34.56 --> 01:44:38.48 about are two totally different things. One of them has a bunch of bad stuff in it. The other one
01:44:38.48 --> 01:44:45.36 has a bunch of good stuff in it. Yes. So why are they both called energy drinks? I'm not 100% sure.
01:44:45.36 --> 01:44:49.52 One of them should be called an energy drink. The other one should be called poison.
01:44:49.52 --> 01:45:01.28 Next question. Not to get too analytical on here, but I think I know why. Because you and, you know,
01:45:01.28 --> 01:45:07.20 some of us, we think of energy drinks not as what the whole energy drink, we just think of the stigma.
01:45:07.20 --> 01:45:12.64 Not just the stigma, but the stigma is a very significant portion of the show. Rightly so, by the way,
01:45:13.20 --> 01:45:18.24 put some, if there's some stuff that's straight up bad for you, that should mean something.
01:45:18.24 --> 01:45:23.20 Yeah. That's what I think. So, you know, you think about those kind of things, or at least so like I said,
01:45:23.20 --> 01:45:27.28 but you know, they're like hippy people that will say like, oh, that's bad energy.
01:45:28.08 --> 01:45:32.24 Yeah, that's different. So now I'm kind of feeling like there's such a thing as like bad energy drinks.
01:45:32.24 --> 01:45:36.72 They like that drink as bad energy. We're at the good energy. And that's lean energy. To me,
01:45:36.72 --> 01:45:42.96 that's in play too. I think so. So, you know, if you consider the stigma of energy drinks and it's not
01:45:42.96 --> 01:45:50.16 an unfair stigma, it's not fair. The daikurits. Fair stigma. If you consider that, and you associate it with
01:45:50.16 --> 01:45:57.76 the word energy drink. Yes, when you look at jocco, discipline, go citrus, cycle, jocco, all these flavors.
01:45:57.76 --> 01:46:04.64 If you look at that, then yeah, they're not going to be very similar in that way. Because we don't have
01:46:04.64 --> 01:46:09.52 the stigma over here. No stigma energy drink without the stigma. How about that? There you go. There you go.
01:46:09.52 --> 01:46:16.32 Boom. Look at that one on joccofuel.com. You like that one. Yes, a joccofuel.com. That's
01:46:16.32 --> 01:46:21.12 we can get it. That's that's part of origin. Main. Yeah, come talk kind of the same deal. You can also
01:46:21.12 --> 01:46:29.12 get them at wawwaw the energy drinks. The stigma, the unstigma stigma, stigma less energy drink at
01:46:29.12 --> 01:46:37.28 wawaw and the vitamin shop as well. Also mok mok. I forget about mok vitamin D. Three cold war
01:46:37.28 --> 01:46:41.84 jocco white tea. I'm Dr. Axi drinkin somewhere. That white tea right now. Drinkin some of that.
01:46:41.84 --> 01:46:46.16 And I'm drinking a discipline. Go so I'm kind of getting after it. Vitamin shop wawaw and origin
01:46:46.16 --> 01:46:52.08 main.com. Also got some we talked about jiu jitsu a little bit today. Fortunately, let's say it was not
01:46:52.64 --> 01:46:59.12 required to be put into use in guadal canal. Right, luckily we still had we had our bayonet. We were
01:46:59.12 --> 01:47:03.76 able to just stab people in the neck and didn't have to choke them. But had it been required. We're
01:47:03.76 --> 01:47:11.28 happy that people were trained in jiu jitsu. And we even if we don't have to use it, even if you
01:47:11.28 --> 01:47:16.32 don't have to use it ever in your life in a real situation, believe me you're going to want to
01:47:16.32 --> 01:47:22.56 have it. So train some jiu jitsu and when you train jiu jitsu, you're going to want a ghee to train in
01:47:23.12 --> 01:47:27.92 you're going to want a rash guard to train in and you're going to want those things to be made
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:33.28 in America. And you're also going to want them. Like you're going to want the best possible ones
01:47:33.28 --> 01:47:37.60 that you could get because you're kind of making a commitment in your life to jiu jitsu. You're going
01:47:37.60 --> 01:47:41.68 to look at yourself in the mirror and say, you know what, we're going to do this. We're going to gain
01:47:41.68 --> 01:47:47.68 a skill that will help you in all aspects of my life. Do you ever or you know how like you look at
01:47:47.68 --> 01:47:53.12 yourself and you kind of have like a little bit of an identity, varying levels of identity,
01:47:53.12 --> 01:48:00.48 whatever. Do you part of that identity are you like a jiu jitsu person for me? Yeah. I would say yes.
01:48:00.48 --> 01:48:05.68 Yes. Yeah. But see how you just said I would say yes. Some because it's a spectrum for sure.
01:48:05.68 --> 01:48:09.84 And not one one is not better than the other by the way. Well, the reason I said that is because
01:48:11.20 --> 01:48:15.60 when we've talked about this on the podcast, if it wasn't here's why I actually it's just
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:21.04 a yes because if it wasn't for jiu jitsu, I wouldn't have be where I am because I wouldn't have
01:48:21.04 --> 01:48:26.56 been able to figure out a bunch of stuff. Like jiu jitsu for me, the physical part, the knowing
01:48:26.56 --> 01:48:34.000 how to submit people or whatever that is as far as what I got from jiu jitsu, this is going to sound
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:41.12 crazy. That part, the actual being able to fight and beat people up of all the beneficial things I
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:50.24 got from jiu jitsu, that part is 20%. The 80% benefit that I got from jiu jitsu was an understanding of the
01:48:50.24 --> 01:48:57.12 world. Now it ties into combat, it ties into leadership and that those things also participated in
01:48:57.12 --> 01:49:04.08 providing me with that 80%. But the jiu jitsu was the factor that allowed me to see it.
01:49:04.08 --> 01:49:10.08 Yeah. So yeah, that makes sense. I think I would agree with that. So yes, I'm a jiu jitsu person.
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:17.92 Yeah. So yeah, I feel like if I look my identity, I'm not not a jiu jitsu person, but I'm not like
01:49:17.92 --> 01:49:24.40 I'm a jiu jitsu person. If you meet someone, someone's not going to be like, oh yeah, that's a jiu jitsu
01:49:24.40 --> 01:49:29.76 guy. That's not the first thing they're going to say. You're not known as a jiu jitsu guy. Yeah.
01:49:29.76 --> 01:49:37.60 But people know you do jiu. Everybody knows you do jiu jitsu, even though they also know you do other
01:49:37.60 --> 01:49:42.16 things. Other things, yeah, that are significant. I think that's why you and I look at you, I don't see
01:49:42.16 --> 01:49:46.16 okay, jiu jitsu guy, even though you're straight up, jiu jitsu guy. Yeah, I'm just going to say like
01:49:46.16 --> 01:49:51.20 I got, yeah, I'm not not a jiu jitsu, but then because you have all these other things that you
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:56.72 have like straight up like for lack of a better term, significant prowess like in, you know,
01:49:56.72 --> 01:50:00.48 I don't know about all that. I don't have significant prowess in jiu jitsu, even though we're
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:04.16 working on that one. What is prowess really? Like doing good at? Yeah, yeah, they're
01:50:04.16 --> 01:50:08.16 a great word. Well, I think that, yeah, good. I've totally missed these
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:12.000 prowess anyway. I think that like the first time I've ever said that out loud, the word
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.40 process and the last one. None of the left. That this would go kicking in, getting them brain cells
01:50:16.40 --> 01:50:22.96 working. Whether you want to be a jiu jitsu person or just have jiu jitsu be
01:50:23.84 --> 01:50:28.000 party your life. You should definitely make it party your life. You're going to need to get your
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.76 community, rashguards, go to originmain.com and unfortunately for all of us, we can't just walk around
01:50:33.76 --> 01:50:40.96 in our geese. Unfortunately, so you got to get other clothing. You can also get that other clothing,

01:50:48.48 --> 01:50:54.72 rivets that are from America. Oh, guess what? Everything I'm talking about without compromise
01:50:54.72 --> 01:51:01.84 made in America. You go to brass buttons, even the brass, the brass, what? But the brass buttons.
01:51:01.84 --> 01:51:06.80 Those are significant. Try look at them. They're like, they're legit. I mentioned the rivets.

01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:50.72 when I had COVID and then you had COVID, I was a little bit happy because I was like,
01:51:50.72 --> 01:51:55.04 cool, we can still record podcasts. We get an average guest plant, at least we can still go in
01:51:55.04 --> 01:52:01.20 the record. No factor. Yeah. It's true. A little bit happy. No no offense. Like, you know,
01:52:01.20 --> 01:52:06.80 COVID plus COVID doesn't equal more. It cancels itself out. Yeah. Kind of thing. All right. Well,
