00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 34 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening Echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And tonight we have a guest on the podcast back for a second time. My brother, Dave Babin. Good evening, Dave. Good evening. Good to be back with you. And if you don't know who Dave Babin is, real easy thing to do is go back to Jockel Podcast number 11 and listen to that.

3
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I give him a long introduction and tell you about who he is. Guy that I served in the SEAL teams with and like I said, go back to 11.

4
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I think he is a little book. Yeah. We wrote a little book called Extreme Ownership. I'm sure we'll talk about that tonight.

5
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Dave was one of the two commanders that that worked for me in the Battle of Romadi when we deployed in 2006 and just wanted my brother's. So.

6
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Thanks for coming on the podcast. Good afternoon.

7
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What do you say to a man that by his own admission has no soul? Why would you say anything?

8
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I've thought about it a good deal.

9
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But he wasn't nothing compared to what was coming down the pike.

10
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They say the eyes are the windows to the soul. I don't know what their eyes was windows to and I guess I'd assume not know.

11
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But there is another view of the world out there and otherwise to see it and that's where this is going.

12
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It has done brought me to a place in my life. I would not have thought out of come to.

13
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Somewhere out there is a true and living profit of destruction.

14
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And I don't want to confront him.

15
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I know he's real.

16
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I've seen his work. I walked in front of those eyes once.

17
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I won't do it again.

18
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I won't push my chips forward and stand up and go out to meet him.

19
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It ain't just being older.

20
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I wish that it was.

21
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.76
I can't say that it's even what you are willing to do because I always knew that you had to be willing to

22
00:02:49.76 --> 00:02:54.76
die to even do this job. That was always true.

23
00:02:54.76 --> 00:02:58.76
Not to sound glorious about or nothing.

24
00:02:58.76 --> 00:03:00.76
But you do.

25
00:03:00.76 --> 00:03:06.76
And if you ain't they'll know it. They'll see it in a heartbeat.

26
00:03:06.76 --> 00:03:13.76
I think it is more like what you are willing to become.

27
00:03:13.76 --> 00:03:21.76
And I think a man would have to put his soul at hazard.

28
00:03:21.76 --> 00:03:25.76
And I won't do that.

29
00:03:25.76 --> 00:03:36.76
I think now that maybe I never would.

30
00:03:36.76 --> 00:03:44.76
Now that's the opening from the book No Country for Old Men, which is written by Corn Mac MacArthur.

31
00:03:44.76 --> 00:03:52.76
You also wrote by favorite non-military memoir book The Book Blood Meridium, which is just an outstanding book.

32
00:03:52.76 --> 00:04:00.76
No country for Old Men was actually made into an outstanding movie as well, which almost follows the book word for word.

33
00:04:00.76 --> 00:04:02.76
It's an awesome movie.

34
00:04:02.76 --> 00:04:07.76
And in the movie and in the book there's a guy that's who's talking in that opening.

35
00:04:07.76 --> 00:04:09.76
Sheriff Ed Tom Bell.

36
00:04:09.76 --> 00:04:17.76
And he's explaining that he's seen evil in the world, a living profit of destruction.

37
00:04:17.76 --> 00:04:21.76
And he's seen his work and walked in front of those eyes.

38
00:04:21.76 --> 00:04:24.76
And Old Smiley, that's kind of what the book is about.

39
00:04:24.76 --> 00:04:29.76
Sheriff Bell is explaining that he doesn't really want to face this evil.

40
00:04:29.76 --> 00:04:33.76
He doesn't want to put his soul at hazard.

41
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:38.76
So ultimately he doesn't really want to be a sheriff anymore.

42
00:04:38.76 --> 00:04:41.76
He can't face that kind of evil.

43
00:04:41.76 --> 00:04:46.76
So he leaves the platoon, put up the police and he retires and stays in his own little world.

44
00:04:46.76 --> 00:04:48.76
And that's the basis of it.

45
00:04:48.76 --> 00:04:53.76
There's a way more to it than that than you should definitely read the book.

46
00:04:53.76 --> 00:04:59.76
Yeah, the book which is it's set, I think it's set in about the 1980s, early early 1980s.

47
00:04:59.76 --> 00:05:06.76
And the evil that he's speaking of that he's having to now deal with as a sheriff is the drug cartels.

48
00:05:06.76 --> 00:05:12.76
Coming out of Mexico, the border of Texas, they've escalated from, you know, petty little drug dealers back in the day.

49
00:05:12.76 --> 00:05:20.76
And now it's a ruthless organized crime syndicates that murder with no mercy.

50
00:05:20.76 --> 00:05:29.76
And like I said, it's just too much for Sheriff Bell and he ends up walking away.

51
00:05:29.76 --> 00:05:48.76
Now meanwhile, in 2016, the evil that we deal with now is even more pervasive and stronger and completely without mercy and it's everywhere.

52
00:05:48.76 --> 00:05:51.76
And we can try and ignore it.

53
00:05:51.76 --> 00:05:55.76
And we can try and act like it doesn't happen.

54
00:05:55.76 --> 00:05:59.76
But there's some things that you cannot ignore.

55
00:05:59.76 --> 00:06:07.76
And in this case, it's something that we cannot walk away from.

56
00:06:07.76 --> 00:06:17.76
In late July of 2016, father Jacques Hamel, an 86-year-old Catholic priest,

57
00:06:17.76 --> 00:06:21.76
was doing what he did every Sunday.

58
00:06:21.76 --> 00:06:26.76
Conducting mass for his parish and Normandy France.

59
00:06:26.76 --> 00:06:36.76
Obviously, the sight of D-Day, where one of the most impactful operations in history in terms of protecting freedom and liberty took place.

60
00:06:36.76 --> 00:06:43.76
And there in Normandy France, in this church, two young men.

61
00:06:43.76 --> 00:06:52.76
And I use that term loosely burst into the mass, brandishing fake guns, fake explosives, but real knives.

62
00:06:52.76 --> 00:07:03.76
And the fake guns and the fake bombs apparently allowed them to get control of the people in the church, including father Hamel.

63
00:07:03.76 --> 00:07:11.76
They forced him to his knees in front of his parishioners.

64
00:07:11.76 --> 00:07:15.76
And they slid his throat.

65
00:07:15.76 --> 00:07:26.76
And in fact, they slit his throat with such force that the reports came back and said that they beheaded him.

66
00:07:26.76 --> 00:07:34.76
And one of the survivors who was a nun said that the attackers who claimed loyalty to the Islamic state,

67
00:07:34.76 --> 00:07:43.76
smiled and appeared to be happy as they slit the priests throat.

68
00:07:43.76 --> 00:07:52.76
And then these two savages attempted to use some of the nuns from the church as human shields to try and escape.

69
00:07:52.76 --> 00:08:03.76
And when they did try and escape, fortunately there were some French police snipers that shot and killed.

70
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:06.76
But obviously the damage was already done.

71
00:08:06.76 --> 00:08:11.76
One priest slaughtered.

72
00:08:11.76 --> 00:08:15.76
One of the nuns who was wounded.

73
00:08:15.76 --> 00:08:22.76
And obviously peace and serenity destroyed.

74
00:08:22.76 --> 00:08:27.76
And that is pure evil.

75
00:08:27.76 --> 00:08:36.76
And that is the same evil that slaughtered 89 innocent people at the Bataclan theater in Paris,

76
00:08:36.76 --> 00:08:49.76
the same evil that murdered 12 cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo, the same evil that led and Islamic extremist to murder 49 people at a nightclub in Florida.

77
00:08:49.76 --> 00:09:02.76
And the same evil that brought down the twin towers and hit the Pentagon and has caused death and mayhem and destruction all over the world.

78
00:09:02.76 --> 00:09:16.76
And unlike Sheriff Ed Tom Bell in the book No Country for Old Men, we can't just walk away from this evil.

79
00:09:16.76 --> 00:09:21.76
Because this evil is everywhere.

80
00:09:21.76 --> 00:09:26.76
And I regret to tell you that it's growing.

81
00:09:26.76 --> 00:09:29.76
And it's going to continue to grow.

82
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:45.76
Unless we, we, the civilized people of the world do something to stop.

83
00:09:45.76 --> 00:10:01.76
And of course with life and background, you know, both of us spent a lot of time in the sealed teams deployed multiple times overseas to confront this evil enemy.

84
00:10:01.76 --> 00:10:12.76
And of course we get a lot of questions about our take on this and to open up the questions for tonight.

85
00:10:12.76 --> 00:10:18.76
The first question is here.

86
00:10:18.76 --> 00:10:22.76
Is the darkness taking hold?

87
00:10:22.76 --> 00:10:27.76
Or do you and Lave see the way out of another war?

88
00:10:27.76 --> 00:10:39.76
What can we do to prevent lone wolf attacks from happening in Europe and America?

89
00:10:39.76 --> 00:10:46.76
Lave. Thanks for coming on. I know this is obviously something both of us think a lot about.

90
00:10:46.76 --> 00:10:54.76
And I know a lot of people are wanting to hear what we think about it.

91
00:10:54.76 --> 00:10:58.76
Is the darkness taking hold, my brother?

92
00:10:58.76 --> 00:11:01.76
There's no doubt that there is some serious darkness in the world.

93
00:11:01.76 --> 00:11:04.76
And I think that darkness, we've seen a grow.

94
00:11:04.76 --> 00:11:09.76
We've seen the number of jihadied terrorist attacks across the world.

95
00:11:09.76 --> 00:11:11.76
Gross substantially over the years.

96
00:11:11.76 --> 00:11:13.76
It's statistically that's just the fact.

97
00:11:13.76 --> 00:11:18.76
And I think it's something that I think people need to understand.

98
00:11:18.76 --> 00:11:21.76
Across America, across the world.

99
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:25.76
People need to understand just how evil this enemy is.

100
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:28.76
We talk about darkness. We talk about evil.

101
00:11:28.76 --> 00:11:33.76
And I think that no country for all men, some are in that intro.

102
00:11:33.76 --> 00:11:35.76
Really captures it in a way.

103
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:38.76
And certainly we've seen that with drug cartels.

104
00:11:38.76 --> 00:11:44.76
Some of the horrific things we're going on in northern Mexico, or even across the border in the United States.

105
00:11:44.76 --> 00:11:53.76
But this Islamic enemy in particular is, in my opinion, as evil and enemy, as the US military is ever faced in our long history.

106
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:59.76
And I'm very well aware of the horrific evils of Nazi Germany and Paralympan.

107
00:11:59.76 --> 00:12:05.76
And I think this threat is every bit or even more evil than that.

108
00:12:05.76 --> 00:12:09.76
It is something that we're seeing as you just described from that one attack.

109
00:12:09.76 --> 00:12:15.76
That's one example of hundreds of hundreds that you could use over the last year to alone.

110
00:12:15.76 --> 00:12:20.76
Yeah, and a good point on that is we hear about the attacks that take place in the Western world.

111
00:12:20.76 --> 00:12:33.76
Right? That's where we hear about if you start diving into the butchery and the slaughter and the torture and the rape that happens in their world, in the Islamic world, in the Middle East.

112
00:12:33.76 --> 00:12:43.76
And again, you and I that have been there, we know for a fact that the majority of people do not want to live under that reign of terror.

113
00:12:43.76 --> 00:12:46.76
No doubt. They want to have normalized.

114
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:53.76
And I say this all the time, I know you say this all the time, they want to have normal lives.

115
00:12:53.76 --> 00:13:07.76
And they're being brought down and driven by this, I mean, evil is it's like, I want a stronger word.

116
00:13:07.76 --> 00:13:13.76
I don't know what stronger word there is, but this is like, this is a, this is a personification of Satan.

117
00:13:13.76 --> 00:13:26.76
That's what this is. So, and I know that's one of the things that struck me and as we were talking, that made me think of no country for all men because when he says, I know he's real.

118
00:13:26.76 --> 00:13:30.76
I've seen his work and and I know both of us have we know he's real.

119
00:13:30.76 --> 00:13:36.76
And anybody that's deployed overseen sees and seen what these people can do is.

120
00:13:36.76 --> 00:13:46.76
And it knows that this is real. Now, the other part of this question, Leif was, what can we do to prevent these loan wolf attacks?

121
00:13:46.76 --> 00:13:51.76
So, so what do you, what's your, what's your thoughts on loan wolf attacks?

122
00:13:51.76 --> 00:13:54.76
Well, I think first of all, the loan wolf attack is a myth.

123
00:13:54.76 --> 00:14:05.76
It's an absolute myth. And you know, this idea that there is these people are just randomly, you know, we use, we also use the term along with loan wolf, they use the term self radicalization.

124
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:16.76
You hear that all the time, self, he's self radicalized. You know, he was a normal kid, everything was great and all of a sudden he followed a Twitter feed from ISIS and decided to go out and kill people.

125
00:14:16.76 --> 00:14:20.76
And in no case, are we seeing that?

126
00:14:20.76 --> 00:14:31.76
We're seeing that to be true. And I think we're discounting that this is, this is an ideology. It comes out of, out of the radical Islamic jihadim movement.

127
00:14:31.76 --> 00:14:42.76
And there's a SUNY component of that. There's a SHI component of that. But there is there are a lot of followers of this. And there are folks that, you know, when the Orlando shooter was a great example.

128
00:14:42.76 --> 00:15:00.76
We have someone with like, oh, he was self radicalized. And the reality was, I mean, you could go back and track the, the guys father and see that his, he had pro Taliban posts on his YouTube channel and, and he's, he's anti-american.

129
00:15:00.76 --> 00:15:03.76
anti-american pro jihadi.

130
00:15:03.76 --> 00:15:19.76
He either in the Senate's home. And the fact that the Orlando shooter also happened to go to the very same mosque where the only known American born suicide bomber attended and went to the same mosque as well.

131
00:15:19.76 --> 00:15:35.76
A guy who traveled to Syria, joined up with ISIS and blew himself up on American citizen. And they both went to the same mosque in four-purs Florida. So where is this coming from? It's coming from ideology. And we have to, we have to recognize that that's a fact.

132
00:15:35.76 --> 00:15:53.76
So many people want to bury their head in the sand and say, you know, Islam's a religion of peace. This has nothing to do with Islam. It has everything to do with Islam. Obviously. And as you said, of course, most of the Islamic world doesn't want to live in this brutal reign of terror. And we're abandoning those people to the likes of of the Islamic state.

133
00:15:53.76 --> 00:16:01.76
And that that reign of terror if we don't stand up, we don't do anything. And so we have to recognize that threat. It is, it is an ideology that pushes that threat.

134
00:16:01.76 --> 00:16:14.76
It's not lone wolf. They're connected by that ideology across the world. And that inspires people to join up. And I think, you know, back to the, that ties us back to the, the first question about is the darkness spreading.

135
00:16:14.76 --> 00:16:26.76
There's always darkness in the world. There's always been even in the world. What keeps that darkness at bay? You can go back to the, the Pax Ramana and talk about peace in the, in the ancient world and how was imposed through

136
00:16:26.76 --> 00:16:41.76
strong military might. And it's no different today. We have enjoyed the, the, the relative peace of post world war two, because we had the strongest, most dominant military in the world. And so we keep that darkness at bay.

137
00:16:41.76 --> 00:16:53.76
That wouldn't have been the case if the United States and our allies had not won World War two, the darkness would have, would have taken over the world or much of the world. So only through military power, peace through strength.

138
00:16:53.76 --> 00:17:14.76
Can we ensure that there's light in the world that the darkness does not take over that we keep that in check. And I think people need to understand that this can, this is an enemy that can be defeated. That this darkness is spreading only because we are allowing it to spread only because it is metastasized only because we have not gone and rooted it out.

139
00:17:14.76 --> 00:17:31.76
So so many Americans, I know they asked you just like they asked me, you know, years ago when we saw ISIS taking over parts of Syria, then coming back into Iraq and establishing a foothold there, taking over huge cities like Mosul and Fouloujou and then Ramadi.

140
00:17:31.76 --> 00:17:47.76
And before they were pushed out, people asked, well why do we really care about that? Why does it matter? And I think now as we're starting to see the kind of horrific attacks that are inspired by their so-called caliphate, that that real estate absolutely matters.

141
00:17:47.76 --> 00:18:03.76
And they're interested in us and it inspires that they can inspire attacks here among us. And we always try to connect it back. People say, well, we don't know if it was related to ISIS. And if Abu Bakr Baghdad, either, you know, the Islamic head of the Islamic state had given them direction.

142
00:18:03.76 --> 00:18:21.76
And it doesn't matter. None of that matters. The fact is that they're able to inspire attacks where people hear amongst us in America and Western Europe and across the world go out and kill and to clear their allegiance. And so we have to go there and we have to destroy them. And it is it is worth the effort for us.

143
00:18:21.76 --> 00:18:35.76
And we have a military that is eager and is ready to do that. And they are itching to make it happen because they understand the nature of the civil just like me and you, they faced it, they've seen it. And you know, as we talked to our our bodies who spent time there are there now.

144
00:18:35.76 --> 00:19:03.76
And they want to close with and destroy this enemy. And yet there's a lot of political strings holding them back from doing so. And I think that's something that it simply requires leaders who understand the nature of this threat and understand that there is a military solution to this. And we have to lead that fight America has to lead that fight. And I think we can absolutely do that. And we can have tremendous impact in the world and make sure that people don't want to join the world.

145
00:19:03.76 --> 00:19:19.76
Because these Islamic State is getting hammered and people are dying in large numbers. And they don't want to go over there and be a part of that. They don't want to join up with the losing side. We got to make sure that that's clear to everybody in the world.

146
00:19:19.76 --> 00:19:27.76
That if they want to be on the side of the radical Islamic jihadis, they're going to die a bloody nasty death.

147
00:19:27.76 --> 00:19:40.76
One of the things that you mentioned real quick and we were kind of going off was was the fact that these people are normal people. One of the things that you and I heard. So so for those of you don't know, late for nine fought with the

148
00:19:40.76 --> 00:20:00.76
first brigade, first armor division in the battle of the body in the summer 2006 where the city of Ramadi was taken back from insurgents. And when we did that, it was a very tough fight, very fierce fight. And we were able to get that city turned around and turn back over to the city of Ramadi.

149
00:20:00.76 --> 00:20:18.76
And it turned into a flourishing city. It was very peaceful for seven years. And when ISIS then took it over, took it back. They, and again, this is what what lay for our told by people that we knew that were on the ground over there. ISIS came in and murdered.

150
00:20:18.76 --> 00:20:44.76
They had a list of about 500 families. And they went in and murdered every person in the family. These were this is a list of family families of whom someone in the family had worked with the coalition forces, worked with the Iraqi government, been against, you know, this form of radical Islam. So ISIS came in and murdered 500 families, which,

151
00:20:44.76 --> 00:20:56.76
to me, it should tell everybody out there that this is an enemy that we must address, we must face, and we must destroy.

152
00:20:56.76 --> 00:21:06.76
I think what people don't understand either is that those same people who were on that list that ISIS brought in, they were screaming and begging for our help.

153
00:21:06.76 --> 00:21:19.76
They wanted American troops on the ground to help them. They don't want to live under that brutal rain of tear. They want us to be able to push that enemy back and give them the chance to live their lives in relative freedom and peace and security.

154
00:21:19.76 --> 00:21:36.76
Yeah, there's a great, there's a great video on vice news that shows prior to ISIS coming back in the Romadi. It's, it's very difficult for me to watch, it'd be difficult for you to watch too, because it's exactly showing exactly what you're saying.

155
00:21:36.76 --> 00:21:50.76
I think he's an Iraqi American because he speaks Arabic and he's conversing with people and they're showing subtitles, but everybody's talking to. He's saying, well, what are you, what are you going to do? It looks like ISIS is coming and they're saying, we want the Americans back.

156
00:21:50.76 --> 00:22:02.76
We want them to come here, we want them to help us, then they got the governor of Romadi and they're, they show him on the phone and he's talking to, whoever his superior is, and he's saying, we need the Americans out here, they're getting too close.

157
00:22:02.76 --> 00:22:20.76
We need American support, we need them and that's the thing that so many people miss in America is the fact that the normal people in these countries, they do not want to live under this kind of regime and they, but they are, it's hard for them to defend themselves against it.

158
00:22:20.76 --> 00:22:34.76
And so that's where America, the benevolent nation that we are, can provide this sort of peace and stability there and it's going to be hard and I say this all the time, right? If you're going to go to war, people are going to die.

159
00:22:34.76 --> 00:22:49.76
Americans are going to die innocent civilians are going to die, but look at what the alternative is, the alternative is you have this disgusting, despicable ideology getting a foothold in the world and it is absolutely disgusting.

160
00:22:49.76 --> 00:22:57.76
And it should not be stood for. And I think people are standing too, when we're talking about destroying the Islamic caliphate, is they, is they call themselves.

161
00:22:57.76 --> 00:23:09.76
And how that real estate alone, them owning that real estate inspires those attacks, it doesn't take in giant ground invasions with hundreds of thousands of troops in order to defeat the enemy.

162
00:23:09.76 --> 00:23:25.76
It takes a few thousand American troops to go and generate momentum to beat them back, partner with folks on the ground like on Mari shakes that we worked with back in the day and US forces worked with for the onboard awakening and they're asking for help.

163
00:23:25.76 --> 00:23:40.76
We need to partner with folks like the president of Egypt and King of Jordan who have talked about how this is a civil war within Islam and they don't, they don't want to subscribe to that, or live under that kind of brutal reign.

164
00:23:40.76 --> 00:23:47.76
They, they want to lead the fight against it. We got to help them, we got to support them. We need to team up with folks like that. It is, we must do it.

165
00:23:47.76 --> 00:23:59.76
And if, if we don't do it, you're going to see the darkness continue to spread until we actually do something about it. So many people want to say, well, let's let others over there lead the fight.

166
00:23:59.76 --> 00:24:07.76
That's kind of like Winston Churchill saying, you know what, the Nazis are in Czechoslovakia in France, that's, that's their problem.

167
00:24:07.76 --> 00:24:09.76
Where do they come in next?

168
00:24:09.76 --> 00:24:18.76
Exactly. All right. That's the Islamic State for your folks.

169
00:24:18.76 --> 00:24:21.76
Move on to the next question here.

170
00:24:21.76 --> 00:24:26.76
Jocconwave, how do you know if you terminated too early?

171
00:24:26.76 --> 00:24:30.76
I wanted to remove the toxicity before damage the team.

172
00:24:30.76 --> 00:24:36.76
When do you know it's time to fire someone? So we'll get into a little, little change in pace here,

173
00:24:36.76 --> 00:24:43.76
going from the darkness of the Islamic State into something a lot more positive, which is people running businesses.

174
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:48.76
And what's good you clarify that, because terminated has a different context and our previous time.

175
00:24:48.76 --> 00:24:51.76
It's Czech. So this is a good question.

176
00:24:51.76 --> 00:24:56.76
Anyway, with something we hear a lot, it we got a ton of questions when I put this out.

177
00:24:56.76 --> 00:25:01.76
So when you know it's time to fire somebody.

178
00:25:01.76 --> 00:25:06.76
We get this question all the time, as you just said, and it's, this was always the most difficult thing.

179
00:25:06.76 --> 00:25:12.76
It is incredibly difficult. Even for, you know, people who feel like they're super, super tough leaders,

180
00:25:12.76 --> 00:25:18.76
are strong leaders in the SEAL teams who've been through all our training and, and, and, and, and, and,

181
00:25:18.76 --> 00:25:22.76
prove themselves on the battlefield, it's hard to fire people. It's always difficult to fire people.

182
00:25:22.76 --> 00:25:26.76
It's hard to have those tough conversations with folks. And so,

183
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:33.76
we've talked about this that the right time to fire somebody is when you don't feel bad about it.

184
00:25:33.76 --> 00:25:40.76
And what I mean by that, I don't mean just because you're co-blooded, but that you actually,

185
00:25:40.76 --> 00:25:48.76
but that you, you actually have taken every step to mentor and train and provide resources and, and,

186
00:25:48.76 --> 00:25:54.76
help that person achieve the performance that you need them to achieve in order to accomplish the mission.

187
00:25:54.76 --> 00:25:59.76
And you've given them every chance to succeed. And once you, you, you, you, you should feel absolutely confident that you,

188
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:05.76
you have exhausted all options. And then you, you're, you're not going to feel bad about it because you,

189
00:26:05.76 --> 00:26:10.76
you've, you've taken so much time and effort and they shouldn't even, they, they're not even going to be upset about it.

190
00:26:10.76 --> 00:26:16.76
Not that they administer a love you are thank you for firing them, but so often you see people that are literally relieved.

191
00:26:16.76 --> 00:26:21.76
When we work with companies and we see this happen, we see people that are relieved because they're in a position where they're just,

192
00:26:21.76 --> 00:26:27.76
they're overwhelmed, there's massive pressure on them. And they knew there, it was, it was beyond their capability.

193
00:26:27.76 --> 00:26:33.76
And they just didn't want to say, I can't do this. And so when they got either fired or just transitioned to a different role,

194
00:26:33.76 --> 00:26:38.76
it was, they were relieved. And they said, thank you. And I, it really was, that was really eating it me,

195
00:26:38.76 --> 00:26:42.76
that I, I didn't feel capable and I didn't feel, I knew I was letting the team down.

196
00:26:42.76 --> 00:26:48.76
And that's almost always the case. Everyone wants to get the torture genius who is just can't take direction or won't listen,

197
00:26:48.76 --> 00:26:53.76
who's never going to see, never going to see that I'd have, but that's okay.

198
00:26:53.76 --> 00:27:00.76
It's okay. Yeah, the only other thing I'd say is laying out the real crystal clear expectations of where you need to be.

199
00:27:00.76 --> 00:27:06.76
Hey, if this is where you, this is where you need to be. And if you don't get there, this is what's going to happen.

200
00:27:06.76 --> 00:27:11.76
And that's why you said it shouldn't be a surprise. It should be, hey, I knew exactly what the expectations were.

201
00:27:11.76 --> 00:27:17.76
I knew exactly what was required of me. And I knew exactly what was going to happen if I didn't meet those expectations requirements.

202
00:27:17.76 --> 00:27:24.76
So that's how you know. And the only other thing is we sometimes, in it's totally normal.

203
00:27:24.76 --> 00:27:39.76
We build a relationship with our people. And so sometimes that relationship gets strong to the point where you might value that relationship more than you value the performance of the team.

204
00:27:39.76 --> 00:27:43.76
And that is not a good situation. Because you have to look out for the whole team.

205
00:27:43.76 --> 00:27:49.76
And if I say, oh, this guy's not doing his job, but he's my bro. So I'm going to keep him on. I'm letting down the whole team.

206
00:27:49.76 --> 00:27:53.76
So that's just another little element that you have to pay attention to.

207
00:27:53.76 --> 00:28:00.76
And if you're to the care about the person, mentor coach him, put him into position where they can't see. Sometimes people aren't good at something.

208
00:28:00.76 --> 00:28:07.76
And you got to move him to a spot where they can. You can take advantage of their strengths instead of putting him to spot where their weaknesses are going to be totally exposed.

209
00:28:07.76 --> 00:28:09.76
That's how you take care of someone.

210
00:28:09.76 --> 00:28:12.76
So that's what you got to do before you fire somebody.

211
00:28:12.76 --> 00:28:21.76
One thing too that I learned from you in the Navy during our time was when you have those tough conversations, you got to write it down.

212
00:28:21.76 --> 00:28:34.76
You have to write it down. And that's something that I thought was very powerful because so often even in the seal teams, you'd see leaders who would say, well, this leader screwed up, you know, this particular commander or this chief's got an issue.

213
00:28:34.76 --> 00:28:46.76
And he's causing, you know, he's dangerous or he's making bad decisions or he's on professional or he's, you know, he's he's not getting his unit where they need to be and we need to call him in and tighten him up.

214
00:28:46.76 --> 00:28:56.76
And you have that conversation behind closed doors when the person isn't present and like right on, let's call him in, let's tighten him up. You come in, they sit down.

215
00:28:56.76 --> 00:29:08.76
And here you are face to face with that person and you just had that closed door conversation about how terrible they were and how they really need it, you know, we're going to square him away and now face to face to conversation goes like this.

216
00:29:08.76 --> 00:29:10.76
Well, you're doing, you're doing a pretty job.

217
00:29:10.76 --> 00:29:24.76
You're doing a pretty good job over all, there's a couple of things we need to work on here there, but maybe not here and I think that's that doesn't help anybody that's the false cheerleading is a disaster and it's something that we talk about all the time and our business.

218
00:29:24.76 --> 00:29:34.76
And I think that's a good job, you know, if you're not sure you mentioned that on the podcast, you know, many times before, but when you write it down, you have it in front of you, so you have to have it tough conversation and you give them a copy.

219
00:29:34.76 --> 00:29:40.76
So they have it with them as well and then they can take that and understand where they need to be and when they need to be there.

220
00:29:40.76 --> 00:29:43.76
And that forces you to have those tough conversations.

221
00:29:43.76 --> 00:29:48.76
It's it's absolutely a game changer and makes you make you address that.

222
00:29:48.76 --> 00:29:50.76
And then again, the false cheerleading is it's a disaster people.

223
00:29:50.76 --> 00:29:54.76
And then you have to fire someone and they're like, what you just said, I was doing a good job.

224
00:29:54.76 --> 00:30:03.76
So obviously you failed as a leader and another another good thing you can do to soften the blow of this stuff when you're when you're delivering the heavy news.

225
00:30:03.76 --> 00:30:05.76
Is you're saying listen, I wrote this down.

226
00:30:05.76 --> 00:30:07.76
I got putting this in front of you. Why am I doing that?

227
00:30:07.76 --> 00:30:12.76
Because I think you can do it. I want you to do it. I'm investing in you.

228
00:30:12.76 --> 00:30:16.76
This is not my way to to make you feel bad. This is my way to make you get better.

229
00:30:16.76 --> 00:30:20.76
I want you to do better. So here's what I just got to do for me. Here it is.

230
00:30:20.76 --> 00:30:24.76
In plain English, do you understand this bullet point? Do you understand this bullet point?

231
00:30:24.76 --> 00:30:28.76
Do you understand this bullet point? That's the best possible thing you can do.

232
00:30:28.76 --> 00:30:30.76
And you got to make them understand that.

233
00:30:30.76 --> 00:30:33.76
Because otherwise they'll walk out of the room saying, oh, he's picking on me. He doesn't like me.

234
00:30:33.76 --> 00:30:37.76
No, no, no, no. The opposite is true. If I didn't like you, I would just fire you.

235
00:30:37.76 --> 00:30:41.76
I want you to perform. I'm mentoring you. I'm coaching you because I want you to do better.

236
00:30:41.76 --> 00:30:45.76
I'm giving you this list. So you know exactly what you have to do to win.

237
00:30:45.76 --> 00:30:51.76
So don't take it the wrong way. My brother just get in the game and get this stuff done.

238
00:30:51.76 --> 00:30:56.76
Hey, do you think? I remember you saying this good evening, Akka.

239
00:30:56.76 --> 00:31:01.76
I remember you saying this to Jay. Remember you were like, you were like, when you don't feel bad.

240
00:31:01.76 --> 00:31:05.76
I don't know if you put in those exact words, but that's basically the message exactly the least.

241
00:31:05.76 --> 00:31:07.76
You don't feel bad about it. You guys both know.

242
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:12.76
You know, you know, do you think that there's a difference between like the seal teams, for example,

243
00:31:12.76 --> 00:31:20.76
because you can't just, or I'm assuming you can't just replace the guy. So it's like it's worth it to invest as much as you possibly can.

244
00:31:20.76 --> 00:31:24.76
It's a million world and the seal teams. I thought this would be different. They're not different. They're the same.

245
00:31:24.76 --> 00:31:34.76
So in this civilian world, every company we go work with doesn't matter what the company is, there's no immediate replacement for somebody that knows a skill set for a software engineer.

246
00:31:34.76 --> 00:31:38.76
Is there a great guy waiting to come in the door? No. Is there a great welder waiting to come in the door?

247
00:31:38.76 --> 00:31:44.76
No. Is there just no matter what these things are? There's not a perfect replacement coming from it's the same thing.

248
00:31:44.76 --> 00:31:50.76
The seal teams, you don't have a ready replacement ready to come in. So of course, you've got a person. You've gone through the agony of finding them.

249
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:56.76
You've gone through the agony of recruiting them. You've gone through the agony of bringing them on board, issuing them their gear,

250
00:31:56.76 --> 00:32:01.76
getting them their computer, letting them understand the culture of the company.

251
00:32:01.76 --> 00:32:06.76
I've done, I've invested so much. You don't want to just fire the person you want them to work out.

252
00:32:06.76 --> 00:32:11.76
And so that's why it's important on either military and civilian. You've made those investments.

253
00:32:11.76 --> 00:32:16.76
The best outcome is to have them succeed. That's always the best outcome.

254
00:32:16.76 --> 00:32:20.76
And so that's why you've got to be a great mentor, a great coach, a great leader.

255
00:32:20.76 --> 00:32:25.76
And I've talked about this before. I'm not going to go into it right now, but some people are allergic to the words mentor.

256
00:32:25.76 --> 00:32:29.76
And some people are allergic to the word coach. You get someone with an ego problem.

257
00:32:29.76 --> 00:32:34.76
And I go, hey, life, welcome to the Petune. I'm going to go ahead and mentor you.

258
00:32:34.76 --> 00:32:40.76
You don't know me? I don't need you. So there's a lot of people that they think, you know, that offends them.

259
00:32:40.76 --> 00:32:44.76
Because that implies, I've said this before, that implies that I know more than you do.

260
00:32:44.76 --> 00:32:48.76
And you know less than me. And I'm the big guy that's going to help you, little guy.

261
00:32:48.76 --> 00:32:52.76
Yeah. So sometimes that direct kind of coaching is not the right answer.

262
00:32:52.76 --> 00:32:57.76
But you know, clearly when you're getting to a point where somebody's going to fire, you need to do some direct coaching.

263
00:32:57.76 --> 00:33:00.76
So that's why we're right now beginning to done correctly.

264
00:33:00.76 --> 00:33:07.76
And one more point on that, which is a great, a great question, cop, but it's that's the easiest, I think, fall back.

265
00:33:07.76 --> 00:33:13.76
And we see that with a lot of leaders. We saw it in the military and we see it throughout, you know, companies and organizations that we work with now.

266
00:33:13.76 --> 00:33:20.76
Oftentimes, it's people that, well, this person is a good enough. I need to fire them and get someone else.

267
00:33:20.76 --> 00:33:25.76
And it almost, most of the time, that's not the case. Most of the time, it's they just need to be led.

268
00:33:25.76 --> 00:33:29.76
They need to be led. They need to have the mission better explain to them. They need to have, you know, the training.

269
00:33:29.76 --> 00:33:33.76
They need to have better resource. They need to have mentorship, just as Jockel's talking about.

270
00:33:33.76 --> 00:33:38.76
And so that's, that's an easy fallback. But it's, it's an excuse. And it's the opposite of extreme ownership.

271
00:33:38.76 --> 00:33:50.76
And really only the case of that torture genius, right, that, that we wrote about the person that just cannot take any direction, no matter how, how valid or, or our positive,

272
00:33:50.76 --> 00:33:56.76
I needed, or they can't take any criticism. They won't accept any responsibility. They, they have it all figured out.

273
00:33:56.76 --> 00:34:00.76
The world just can't see the genius and what they do. You know, that's kind of how they look at things.

274
00:34:00.76 --> 00:34:08.76
That's the only time that you really have to fire those folks. And generally, yeah, and the thing you didn't say, you hit, like, four points,

275
00:34:08.76 --> 00:34:13.76
you want to, one of the best places to start if someone's not doing what they're supposed to be doing is explain to them why they're doing it.

276
00:34:13.76 --> 00:34:19.76
What this is why I want you to do this, because then they can absorb it. They understand what the deep mission is.

277
00:34:19.76 --> 00:34:24.76
They understand kind of the commanders intent. So whenever someone's not doing this, and I, you know what,

278
00:34:24.76 --> 00:34:29.76
I'm just going to let him break out a story right now. Could do it. So I got a seven-year-old daughter.

279
00:34:29.76 --> 00:34:36.76
She can't ride or bike yet. Right, that's not good. You should be riding a bike at four, right? And my family is four.

280
00:34:36.76 --> 00:34:44.76
So she can't ride a bike yet. One or two. So, and she's, and it's become a thing. It's become an issue, right?

281
00:34:44.76 --> 00:34:50.76
So the other day, and we're going on a big camping trip, and it's going to be necessity to be able to ride the bike.

282
00:34:50.76 --> 00:34:55.76
So the other day, I started telling, okay, we got to go work on your bike riding. So I'm like, come, get your shoes on, get ready to go.

283
00:34:55.76 --> 00:35:00.76
And she's immediately goes defensive. I don't, I don't want to ride a bike. I can't ride a bike. I'm not good at it.

284
00:35:00.76 --> 00:35:05.76
And I started getting right, you know, no, listen, get your shoes on. I went that route like an idiot.

285
00:35:05.76 --> 00:35:12.76
And I luckily I didn't go too far down that road. And I just stopped myself after two direct orders with no explanation of why.

286
00:35:12.76 --> 00:35:17.76
And I said, hey, sweetie, we're going to go work on your bike ride. Let me tell you why.

287
00:35:17.76 --> 00:35:26.76
Because when we go camping, almost everywhere we're going to be going is going to be on the bike, especially when it's time to bike ride to go get ice cream.

288
00:35:26.76 --> 00:35:33.76
We're going to have to ride bikes to get ice cream. And so all I want to make sure is that you're able to come with us when we go to get ice cream.

289
00:35:33.76 --> 00:35:37.76
You know, I mean, I don't want to have to bring it back for you. I want you to come with us.

290
00:35:37.76 --> 00:35:41.76
And you could see, and I just completely changed attack.

291
00:35:41.76 --> 00:35:45.76
And she was said, you know, okay, let me get my shoes on.

292
00:35:45.76 --> 00:35:56.76
And literally, that's an example with a seven year old, right? And first of all, the first note there is that I missed your big leadership expert completely went down the wrong road.

293
00:35:56.76 --> 00:36:00.76
And it was like, listen to me because I'm the father and I know you do what I tell you.

294
00:36:00.76 --> 00:36:03.76
It's a wrong approach, 100% of the time even with the seven year old.

295
00:36:03.76 --> 00:36:08.76
And as soon as I went back and said, hey, here's why I want you. And you know, I told a bunch of other things, you know, it's really good.

296
00:36:08.76 --> 00:36:11.76
This is how we're going to do get around the sight and get around the beach.

297
00:36:11.76 --> 00:36:15.76
I don't know all these things and change the attitude. It literally changed the attitude in a minute.

298
00:36:15.76 --> 00:36:19.76
I wish I would have video tape the whole thing because we could have posted it.

299
00:36:19.76 --> 00:36:20.76
Yep.

300
00:36:20.76 --> 00:36:22.76
Yeah, that would have been a good little case study.

301
00:36:22.76 --> 00:36:25.76
Yeah, flying through with the ice cream money.

302
00:36:25.76 --> 00:36:33.76
The would you say back to the hiring and people, you know, you don't have just someone waiting in the wings to get higher to to fill that position, remember?

303
00:36:33.76 --> 00:36:42.76
Um, I kind of is the case on most of the time where if you fire someone and it's like, oh, we'll just replace them.

304
00:36:42.76 --> 00:36:49.76
Right. All that work and stuff. You got to rehire somebody. Ben, that you're wasting time and resources to do that.

305
00:36:49.76 --> 00:36:54.76
You could just be investing more and kind of always want your team to succeed.

306
00:36:54.76 --> 00:36:56.76
And sometimes people take that too far.

307
00:36:56.76 --> 00:36:59.76
You get someone that just wants a team to see why they're not going to fire somebody.

308
00:36:59.76 --> 00:37:01.76
So there's always a balance. There's always done in the economy there.

309
00:37:01.76 --> 00:37:09.76
But yes, that is true. So do you make the exception if let's say you know, let's say, hey, I hired this, I don't know, you weigh it.

310
00:37:09.76 --> 00:37:10.76
You weigh it.

311
00:37:10.76 --> 00:37:14.76
So if you do have a guy kind of waiting in the wings, I don't know my neighbor.

312
00:37:14.76 --> 00:37:14.76
Yeah.

313
00:37:14.76 --> 00:37:14.76
Of course.

314
00:37:14.76 --> 00:37:15.76
Hey, he's winning win.

315
00:37:15.76 --> 00:37:18.76
So you're going to invest less in this guy because we got this guy ready to go.

316
00:37:18.76 --> 00:37:20.76
Well, no, you won't invest less.

317
00:37:20.76 --> 00:37:21.76
You're not going to invest anything.

318
00:37:21.76 --> 00:37:24.76
If you've got someone that's going to come in and do the job and this person can't make it happen.

319
00:37:24.76 --> 00:37:25.76
It's failed.

320
00:37:25.76 --> 00:37:25.76
Right.

321
00:37:25.76 --> 00:37:27.76
Currently get rid of him.

322
00:37:27.76 --> 00:37:28.76
Yeah.

323
00:37:28.76 --> 00:37:31.76
Jack, there you go.

324
00:37:31.76 --> 00:37:33.76
Good times.

325
00:37:33.76 --> 00:37:34.76
Yeah.

326
00:37:34.76 --> 00:37:35.76
All right.

327
00:37:35.76 --> 00:37:38.76
Here we go.

328
00:37:38.76 --> 00:37:41.76
Jocco and life.

329
00:37:41.76 --> 00:37:45.76
Explain how you first met and worked together.

330
00:37:45.76 --> 00:37:49.76
In the second part is how do you say stay so disciplined every day.

331
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:52.76
So life.

332
00:37:52.76 --> 00:37:54.76
Meeting Jocco.

333
00:37:54.76 --> 00:37:55.76
Good times.

334
00:37:55.76 --> 00:37:56.76
How was that?

335
00:37:56.76 --> 00:38:01.76
Well, we touched on this a little bit in podcast 11.

336
00:38:01.76 --> 00:38:05.76
But it was a good time.

337
00:38:05.76 --> 00:38:10.76
I checked in a, I checked in a sealed team three back in the spring of 2005.

338
00:38:10.76 --> 00:38:13.76
And I was taking over as the particular man for Charter with Tune.

339
00:38:13.76 --> 00:38:17.76
And I see, I see the, I see the name of the board, Jocco.

340
00:38:17.76 --> 00:38:19.76
And I already kind of heard his name around.

341
00:38:19.76 --> 00:38:20.76
People kind of knew he was.

342
00:38:20.76 --> 00:38:23.76
But I didn't, I didn't know much about Jocco.

343
00:38:23.76 --> 00:38:27.76
I was like, but our chief Tony, who we've also talked about.

344
00:38:27.76 --> 00:38:32.76
It was just a complete badass, amazing or your incredible combat leader.

345
00:38:32.76 --> 00:38:37.76
And he, he said, hey, Jocco is good to go.

346
00:38:37.76 --> 00:38:38.76
He's like, Jocco's who you want.

347
00:38:38.76 --> 00:38:39.76
It was like right on.

348
00:38:39.76 --> 00:38:40.76
I'm looking forward to meet Jocco.

349
00:38:40.76 --> 00:38:42.76
And this time, Jocco was the admiral's aid.

350
00:38:42.76 --> 00:38:47.76
So I think you were still busy kind of running around and trying to turn over those duties there.

351
00:38:47.76 --> 00:38:50.76
Very busy job, difficult job.

352
00:38:50.76 --> 00:38:52.76
But, but important job certainly.

353
00:38:52.76 --> 00:38:59.76
And so when Jocco finally showed up the team, the first time I remember seeing it was it was it we had a morning formation.

354
00:38:59.76 --> 00:39:05.76
So we all, we all go to, you know, our morning meeting and then we stand information out back of the team.

355
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:12.76
And everyone musters up and, and I just wanted to look at a Jocco and hit zero smile on his face.

356
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:14.76
Just a scow.

357
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:15.76
No smile whatsoever.

358
00:39:15.76 --> 00:39:18.76
If I, I don't think you smile for the first two months.

359
00:39:18.76 --> 00:39:20.76
Yeah, I have two months.

360
00:39:20.76 --> 00:39:22.76
Two months more, it's horrible when I meet people for smile.

361
00:39:22.76 --> 00:39:25.76
And so he just came out to us and he just looked at us and said,

362
00:39:25.76 --> 00:39:26.76
I'm Jocco.

363
00:39:26.76 --> 00:39:31.76
Just staring through his like, you wanted to murder us and shaking her hand.

364
00:39:31.76 --> 00:39:34.76
It was me and then our other, the other, the other two, the other two, the other two.

365
00:39:34.76 --> 00:39:40.76
And he dealt with it and we knew each other well, we in the Delta Tudigameter and you know we're, we're like looking in each other.

366
00:39:40.76 --> 00:39:43.76
And he's like, he looks amazing.

367
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:46.76
Jocco hates me, I can already tell.

368
00:39:46.76 --> 00:39:47.76
Yeah.

369
00:39:47.76 --> 00:39:50.76
Jocco hates everybody.

370
00:39:50.76 --> 00:39:55.76
But what I didn't realize later until after we worked together, he gave me a copy of the book about face,

371
00:39:55.76 --> 00:39:59.76
which we talked about many, you know, you've talked about many times on the podcast.

372
00:39:59.76 --> 00:40:01.76
And it's tremendously influential book.

373
00:40:01.76 --> 00:40:06.76
I know on you, certainly on me and on our entire generation about face by Colonel David Hackworth.

374
00:40:06.76 --> 00:40:13.76
I realized that that's what he did when he checked in and took over his unit, which he renamed the hardcore.

375
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:20.76
And actually, he said, I didn't smile at anybody for six weeks or something like the first first couple of months he was there.

376
00:40:20.76 --> 00:40:22.76
I like to be like the harder than Hackworth, so I go to months.

377
00:40:22.76 --> 00:40:26.76
Wait, did you get it from Hackworth or was that, I think, you remember?

378
00:40:26.76 --> 00:40:27.76
I probably did.

379
00:40:27.76 --> 00:40:29.76
I ripped off so much stuff from Hackworth.

380
00:40:29.76 --> 00:40:34.76
I definitely ripped off like we renamed it, the task, which was called Bravo, we renamed it,

381
00:40:34.76 --> 00:40:36.76
Bruser, complete rip off from Hackworth.

382
00:40:36.76 --> 00:40:39.76
So, but I, it worked.

383
00:40:39.76 --> 00:40:40.76
Yeah.

384
00:40:40.76 --> 00:40:43.76
I always have a, I mean, you meet me.

385
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:47.76
I'm going to be standing off as I'm not, I'm not a big, you know, I don't open up.

386
00:40:47.76 --> 00:40:48.76
I'm just not generally like that.

387
00:40:48.76 --> 00:40:49.76
Yeah.

388
00:40:49.76 --> 00:40:50.76
Oh, you'll say you did me like that.

389
00:40:50.76 --> 00:40:51.76
Yeah.

390
00:40:51.76 --> 00:40:52.76
Roku.

391
00:40:52.76 --> 00:40:53.76
All right.

392
00:40:53.76 --> 00:40:55.76
He pined in smile for the first two years that he knew you.

393
00:40:55.76 --> 00:40:56.76
Yeah.

394
00:40:56.76 --> 00:40:57.76
Yeah.

395
00:40:57.76 --> 00:41:01.76
The tough thing is though, is when you take over a position like that in the seal teams and lay if you know this,

396
00:41:01.76 --> 00:41:02.76
you don't know who you're getting.

397
00:41:02.76 --> 00:41:04.76
You don't know anything about them.

398
00:41:04.76 --> 00:41:09.76
You have guys that you are going to have to put trust and faith in.

399
00:41:09.76 --> 00:41:16.76
To lead guys and combat and it's, it's a very, that's the way I saw it.

400
00:41:16.76 --> 00:41:23.76
And, and I knew that with you guys, you guys with a platoon commanders, you guys are going to be all in the battlefield.

401
00:41:23.76 --> 00:41:26.76
Every day, you guys are going to be leading guys and combat.

402
00:41:26.76 --> 00:41:29.76
The most, there's going to be so much pressure on you guys.

403
00:41:29.76 --> 00:41:30.76
There was going to be violence.

404
00:41:30.76 --> 00:41:32.76
There was going to be war.

405
00:41:32.76 --> 00:41:37.76
And so I wanted to, and, and it was a chance, you're going to get fired.

406
00:41:37.76 --> 00:41:40.76
You know, I didn't want to be friends with you yet.

407
00:41:40.76 --> 00:41:43.76
I wanted to make sure you made it through certain wickets.

408
00:41:43.76 --> 00:41:45.76
And then obviously, the more I got to know you.

409
00:41:45.76 --> 00:41:53.76
And actually, there was, at this time, you know, I wasn't, I guess the word is, I wasn't as mature as I am right now.

410
00:41:53.76 --> 00:41:58.76
So I was talking to one of the, one of the senior officers at the team.

411
00:41:58.76 --> 00:42:02.76
And they were thinking about maybe switching guys around or moving the platoons around.

412
00:42:02.76 --> 00:42:06.76
And now this, at that point, you guys had, I had got to know you guys.

413
00:42:06.76 --> 00:42:14.76
You, and the Delta Ptun Commander, and realize that you guys were exactly who I wanted to be with me in combat.

414
00:42:14.76 --> 00:42:18.76
Exactly the type of guys that I knew would never,

415
00:42:18.76 --> 00:42:23.76
Back down would go forward and would kick ass.

416
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:25.76
And I knew that.

417
00:42:25.76 --> 00:42:31.76
But this guy says to me, he says, hey, you know, we're thinking about maybe moving some of the Tune Commanders where,

418
00:42:31.76 --> 00:42:36.76
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, no, the two guys I got are the two guys I'm keeping.

419
00:42:36.76 --> 00:42:40.76
And they're like, well, you know, do they have the qualities that you want, you know, for a,

420
00:42:40.76 --> 00:42:44.76
And I said, they have the two qualities.

421
00:42:44.76 --> 00:42:47.76
He said the qualities, I said, I only need two qualities.

422
00:42:47.76 --> 00:42:50.76
They need to be able to listen, which means they're humble.

423
00:42:50.76 --> 00:42:52.76
And they need to be tough.

424
00:42:52.76 --> 00:42:54.76
And that's what those guys are.

425
00:42:54.76 --> 00:42:57.76
Because I dished out all kinds of crap on these guys.

426
00:42:57.76 --> 00:42:59.76
And they always just took it.

427
00:42:59.76 --> 00:43:04.76
We wouldn't have lasted long because we were all trained in Jiu Jitsu at 0,500 every morning.

428
00:43:04.76 --> 00:43:06.76
So we were all.

429
00:43:06.76 --> 00:43:09.76
And it was, we had an awesome task in it.

430
00:43:09.76 --> 00:43:12.76
And, you know, Jako mentored and trained us.

431
00:43:12.76 --> 00:43:17.76
And I'm sure he was frustrated with our performance initially because he had a lot more experience than me or

432
00:43:17.76 --> 00:43:18.76
Delta Platoon Commander.

433
00:43:18.76 --> 00:43:22.76
And yet he spent the time to train and mentor us and get us to where we needed to be.

434
00:43:22.76 --> 00:43:28.76
And by the time we deployed, you know, to the battlefield and Ramadi unleashed us on the battlefield to lead our

435
00:43:28.76 --> 00:43:29.76
wounds.

436
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:35.76
And even underneath us, within the Platoon, our assistant Platoon commanders and our Platoon chief and our leading

437
00:43:35.76 --> 00:43:36.76
petty officer.

438
00:43:36.76 --> 00:43:40.76
I mean, our senior leaders, they were out leading their own illness on the battlefield.

439
00:43:40.76 --> 00:43:43.76
And so he had to have tremendous faith and trust in those guys.

440
00:43:43.76 --> 00:43:45.76
And we certainly built that.

441
00:43:45.76 --> 00:43:50.76
And it was all certainly due to Jako's leadership, TU Bruser.

442
00:43:50.76 --> 00:43:53.76
Thanks to Colonel David Hackworth.

443
00:43:53.76 --> 00:44:02.76
And, you know, everybody should know that it's late for an eye are the mouthpieces right now for a bunch of

444
00:44:02.76 --> 00:44:05.76
bad-ass guys that all stepped up.

445
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:08.76
And when we were going through training, crushing it, we were going overseas, crushed it.

446
00:44:08.76 --> 00:44:12.76
We're two people from a big unit.

447
00:44:12.76 --> 00:44:16.76
And all those guys, you know, we're just getting after it.

448
00:44:16.76 --> 00:44:17.76
And we put them all.

449
00:44:17.76 --> 00:44:19.76
You know, we didn't, you know, we were just talking about firing people.

450
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:22.76
We fired people from task unit, Bruser that didn't make the cut.

451
00:44:22.76 --> 00:44:23.76
And we tried.

452
00:44:23.76 --> 00:44:25.76
We did the things we were supposed to do.

453
00:44:25.76 --> 00:44:26.76
We mentored them.

454
00:44:26.76 --> 00:44:27.76
We helped them along.

455
00:44:27.76 --> 00:44:30.76
And at the end of the day, they weren't ready.

456
00:44:30.76 --> 00:44:31.76
And so we got rid of them.

457
00:44:31.76 --> 00:44:35.76
So when we went overseas, we were ready rock.

458
00:44:35.76 --> 00:44:36.76
We knew we could counter everybody.

459
00:44:36.76 --> 00:44:37.76
No doubt.

460
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:38.76
No doubt.

461
00:44:38.76 --> 00:44:40.76
And that's, I think that's something that people, you know, miss.

462
00:44:40.76 --> 00:44:45.76
And we talked about that all the time that, you know, what makes a team the biggest lesson we

463
00:44:45.76 --> 00:44:49.76
brought back from the body was that, the leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.

464
00:44:49.76 --> 00:44:51.76
Leaders at every level.

465
00:44:51.76 --> 00:44:55.76
So, you know, why we had an extraordinary task unit was because we had those leaders at every

466
00:44:55.76 --> 00:44:57.76
level of step-up.

467
00:44:57.76 --> 00:45:02.36
Not just me, not just Jaco, our squad leaders in charge of eight guys, our fire team leaders

468
00:45:02.36 --> 00:45:03.36
in charge of four guys.

469
00:45:03.36 --> 00:45:09.000
The two men, shoot, repair, down in the front line, shoot, or just step up, own his piece of

470
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
the mission and let and got after it.

471
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
And when you think about, actually, as I'm sitting here thinking about, because I really

472
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.56
haven't thought about this too much, about the process of going from

473
00:45:21.56 --> 00:45:22.56
the side to side.

474
00:45:22.56 --> 00:45:24.36
I don't know these two guys.

475
00:45:24.36 --> 00:45:25.96
I don't trust these two guys.

476
00:45:25.96 --> 00:45:27.16
That's the main piece of it, right?

477
00:45:27.16 --> 00:45:31.04
I don't trust these two guys because I don't know them.

478
00:45:31.04 --> 00:45:33.16
And so how do you build that trust?

479
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:37.20
And somebody asked me that the other day and it's just, it's a really good point of how

480
00:45:37.20 --> 00:45:42.56
do you build trust with people and the best way I think to build trust is to give trust.

481
00:45:42.56 --> 00:45:46.20
So I said, you know, I look at life and say, hey, you run this operation.

482
00:45:46.20 --> 00:45:48.88
You know, when it's, you run this training operation, I trust that you can do it.

483
00:45:48.88 --> 00:45:51.52
Now, when I give him that trust, he's looking at me.

484
00:45:51.52 --> 00:45:53.76
He's thinking himself, hey, this guy trusts me.

485
00:45:53.76 --> 00:45:56.08
So we're building the trust.

486
00:45:56.08 --> 00:45:58.84
Whereas if I say, life, I'll run this.

487
00:45:58.84 --> 00:46:00.04
You just, you just follow me.

488
00:46:00.04 --> 00:46:01.28
You just get in the back seat.

489
00:46:01.28 --> 00:46:03.04
You just step aside.

490
00:46:03.04 --> 00:46:05.88
I, that's where you were not building trust.

491
00:46:05.88 --> 00:46:08.52
And if we went on to play, if I had acted like that, hold a appointment, we got an appointment.

492
00:46:08.52 --> 00:46:10.76
I wouldn't have had built any trust.

493
00:46:10.76 --> 00:46:13.80
And I'll tell you one more thing.

494
00:46:13.80 --> 00:46:17.64
As I was sitting here thinking, we did everything together.

495
00:46:17.64 --> 00:46:19.04
I mean, no doubt.

496
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:21.64
The dinner we worked out, we did jujitsu.

497
00:46:21.64 --> 00:46:25.44
This was you, me, the other, the other, the other, the other, the delta, the delta, the

498
00:46:25.44 --> 00:46:27.04
delta, we did everything together.

499
00:46:27.04 --> 00:46:29.60
I mean, you guys live together.

500
00:46:29.60 --> 00:46:31.28
And we all live the same neighborhood.

501
00:46:31.28 --> 00:46:32.28
We serve together.

502
00:46:32.28 --> 00:46:33.28
We live together.

503
00:46:33.28 --> 00:46:34.44
Everything was together.

504
00:46:34.44 --> 00:46:35.44
We debrief together.

505
00:46:35.44 --> 00:46:42.16
And that is how you get this bond and this massive amount of trust where I look at you

506
00:46:42.16 --> 00:46:44.80
and know, I don't have to say a word.

507
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:45.80
You know the deal.

508
00:46:45.80 --> 00:46:47.24
I know the deal.

509
00:46:47.24 --> 00:46:48.64
And we go forward.

510
00:46:48.64 --> 00:46:54.24
One thing I was just thinking about too is this is something I think you brought to

511
00:46:54.24 --> 00:46:55.24
the table.

512
00:46:55.24 --> 00:46:59.12
I mean, as you were training us and mentoring us, it's been in time with us and building

513
00:46:59.12 --> 00:47:00.12
that trust.

514
00:47:00.12 --> 00:47:03.36
As we were going through all this training, you get ready for a comment appointment.

515
00:47:03.36 --> 00:47:06.24
If you come in and say, you talked about before, like, I'm going to coach you.

516
00:47:06.24 --> 00:47:07.24
I'm going to mentor you.

517
00:47:07.24 --> 00:47:11.32
Obviously, that makes people like, when you actually say, when you said to me, like,

518
00:47:11.32 --> 00:47:13.96
life, you got this, like, hey, run this.

519
00:47:13.96 --> 00:47:16.96
And then I'm putting a situation where I know Jack was going to a bunch of experience

520
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:19.92
in this, this particular direct action, you know, raids.

521
00:47:19.92 --> 00:47:22.000
You just come back from Iraq and had a bunch of experience.

522
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.04
I didn't have any experience in that.

523
00:47:23.04 --> 00:47:27.04
I've let a few cyber operations, you know, but that was it.

524
00:47:27.04 --> 00:47:30.84
And I didn't done any, you know, direct action raids like that.

525
00:47:30.84 --> 00:47:34.40
So here we are getting, getting, I'm getting thrust into it.

526
00:47:34.40 --> 00:47:35.04
I'm in charge.

527
00:47:35.04 --> 00:47:36.44
I got to make some calls.

528
00:47:36.44 --> 00:47:37.44
It's humbling.

529
00:47:37.44 --> 00:47:38.88
So what does that make me do?

530
00:47:38.88 --> 00:47:41.16
It makes me like, hey, Jack, what do you think about this?

531
00:47:41.16 --> 00:47:42.92
Hey, what do you know, there's kind of what I'm thinking here.

532
00:47:42.92 --> 00:47:43.92
What do you think?

533
00:47:43.92 --> 00:47:49.000
It opens up the conversation of like, hey, I'm looking for mentorship.

534
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.64
I'm looking for training rather than I got it all figured out.

535
00:47:51.64 --> 00:47:56.08
So even had I thought that initially, you know, at that point when you don't have experience,

536
00:47:56.08 --> 00:47:57.52
you don't even know what you don't know.

537
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:02.56
So when you put people in a situation that there, it's beyond their comfort zone, it's outside

538
00:48:02.56 --> 00:48:07.12
of, you know, their real knowledge base, they look, they're looking to you for help.

539
00:48:07.12 --> 00:48:08.12
They're looking to you for guidance.

540
00:48:08.12 --> 00:48:09.12
That's a good point.

541
00:48:09.12 --> 00:48:12.36
And actually, somebody, somebody, we were working with a company the other day on the

542
00:48:12.36 --> 00:48:15.32
company's coast and we were going through something.

543
00:48:15.32 --> 00:48:20.88
And we were, you were describing me, quote unquote mentoring you.

544
00:48:20.88 --> 00:48:23.32
And again, I hate to use that word.

545
00:48:23.32 --> 00:48:28.20
But when you describe it, you said, hey, Jack will ask me this and then he asked me this

546
00:48:28.20 --> 00:48:30.12
and then he asked me this.

547
00:48:30.12 --> 00:48:33.36
And what I was doing was saying, hey, life, why are you doing that right there in

548
00:48:33.36 --> 00:48:34.36
Lafson?

549
00:48:34.36 --> 00:48:35.36
Well, this is what I thought.

550
00:48:35.36 --> 00:48:38.20
And I said, okay, well, what would you do then if this happened and Lafson?

551
00:48:38.20 --> 00:48:39.76
Ooh, that's a good point.

552
00:48:39.76 --> 00:48:43.36
And so instead of me saying, life, don't do that, you do this right here.

553
00:48:43.36 --> 00:48:44.20
I didn't do that.

554
00:48:44.20 --> 00:48:47.40
I was asking him questions and letting him find the answer.

555
00:48:47.40 --> 00:48:52.16
And also the other point of this for real is I wasn't just asking him the question, like,

556
00:48:52.16 --> 00:48:54.84
so that I could guide him down the perfect path.

557
00:48:54.84 --> 00:48:57.52
I'm legitimately asking him, like, why are you doing that right there?

558
00:48:57.52 --> 00:49:00.28
Because maybe he's got an idea and I said, that could be positive.

559
00:49:00.28 --> 00:49:05.36
I can talk to that example because that was in the kill house.

560
00:49:05.36 --> 00:49:06.36
Yeah.

561
00:49:06.36 --> 00:49:08.92
We're working to the kill house and, you know, for those in our neighborhood of

562
00:49:08.92 --> 00:49:15.84
the kill house, as you've got rooms and hallways in a building and oftentimes it's

563
00:49:15.84 --> 00:49:19.000
ballistic wall so we can shoot live fire in there.

564
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Something swat teams use or any military in the world, but it's, it's, you work on

565
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.32
your close quarter combat skills or CQC where you, you, you, you, you, you,

566
00:49:26.32 --> 00:49:30.80
interdoorways and you work together as a team clearing these halls and rooms and

567
00:49:30.80 --> 00:49:34.80
moving through a, a, a target building in a training environment and often they can

568
00:49:34.80 --> 00:49:38.000
change them and move the, move the hallways around or change doorways.

569
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.60
So, so it mixes it up every time you can't really get used to, you know, doing it one

570
00:49:41.60 --> 00:49:47.32
way or the other and, and so I'd been told as an officer, my job was to stand in the

571
00:49:47.32 --> 00:49:49.40
back and just take the report.

572
00:49:49.40 --> 00:49:55.20
So, that's what I did and the report being how many, how many people have been shot,

573
00:49:55.20 --> 00:49:58.60
how many hostages have been captured, how many seals have been wounded, exactly.

574
00:49:58.60 --> 00:50:03.36
I've got the little quarterback sleeve on my arm with a grease pencil and I'm just

575
00:50:03.36 --> 00:50:04.36
standing in the back doing that.

576
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:11.24
The question I'll ask me was, hey, life, he, he, he, he, it wasn't condescending.

577
00:50:11.24 --> 00:50:15.12
It was, you know, the tone really mattered and he said, well, why are you in the back?

578
00:50:15.12 --> 00:50:20.08
And he was very curious about why I was in the back, what was my tactical reasoning for

579
00:50:20.08 --> 00:50:21.08
that?

580
00:50:21.08 --> 00:50:24.20
And I looked at him and I was like, that's what I was told to do and someone who had

581
00:50:24.20 --> 00:50:30.08
told me that didn't really have any real experience on, on a real battlefield and say,

582
00:50:30.08 --> 00:50:32.40
well, you're, you're an officer, you just stand in the back.

583
00:50:32.40 --> 00:50:35.24
And so, so I thought I'm going to aggressively do that.

584
00:50:35.24 --> 00:50:38.24
That's what I'm going to do and that's, that's where I was aggressively standing in the

585
00:50:38.24 --> 00:50:39.24
back.

586
00:50:39.24 --> 00:50:42.04
And I'm a pretty default, I'm a pretty default aggressive leader and I was like, hey, if my

587
00:50:42.04 --> 00:50:46.08
job is to stand in the back and take this report, I'm going to do it better than anybody

588
00:50:46.08 --> 00:50:47.08
watching this.

589
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:49.24
And when Jocco asked me that, he's like, well, why are you in the back?

590
00:50:49.24 --> 00:50:52.40
And I was like, because that's where I thought I was supposed to be.

591
00:50:52.40 --> 00:50:56.28
And then he asked me another question was, do you know what's going on in the front of the

592
00:50:56.28 --> 00:50:57.28
train right now?

593
00:50:57.28 --> 00:51:01.28
You know, I've got, I've got 15 guys spread out through the build, they're in different

594
00:51:01.28 --> 00:51:02.28
rooms and stuff.

595
00:51:02.28 --> 00:51:06.44
And I was like, I have no idea what's going on in the train up front.

596
00:51:06.44 --> 00:51:12.56
And so then the follow-up on question, I was like, well, how can you, how can you lead this?

597
00:51:12.56 --> 00:51:13.56
How can you lead this team?

598
00:51:13.56 --> 00:51:17.68
How can you be the commander control for your team if you don't know what's going on up

599
00:51:17.68 --> 00:51:18.68
front?

600
00:51:18.68 --> 00:51:20.88
I was like, I mean, it was just light bulb on the go off.

601
00:51:20.88 --> 00:51:24.92
Like, I have to, I have to be in a position where I know where you know where I need to

602
00:51:24.92 --> 00:51:25.92
be.

603
00:51:25.92 --> 00:51:31.04
And that was, it showed me that I was, I was not only was I wrong and where I was, I was

604
00:51:31.04 --> 00:51:34.76
failing as a leader and failing my team if I couldn't actually lead them and know what's

605
00:51:34.76 --> 00:51:35.76
going on.

606
00:51:35.76 --> 00:51:39.96
So the proper position for me was forward somewhere in the middle generally, and I can move

607
00:51:39.96 --> 00:51:40.96
around.

608
00:51:40.96 --> 00:51:44.08
I didn't want to get so far forward that I'm getting sucked into every room clearance

609
00:51:44.08 --> 00:51:47.44
or getting in a gunfighting in the hallway because I got to be able to stand back and

610
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:51.24
see what's going on, but not so far in the back that I don't know what's going on up front.

611
00:51:51.24 --> 00:51:54.16
So that he never needed to tell me that again.

612
00:51:54.16 --> 00:51:58.28
It was, I knew where I needed to be, I understood that it made sense to me.

613
00:51:58.28 --> 00:52:03.08
And I think if you want to, that's a great example of being able to successfully mentor your

614
00:52:03.08 --> 00:52:06.84
people so they understand, you know, to ask them those questions in a way that's meaningful,

615
00:52:06.84 --> 00:52:12.20
it's not condescending, it's not, you know, I know everything, you know, why are you doing

616
00:52:12.20 --> 00:52:16.16
that, but, uh, or don't do this, but, but actually ask me the questions and I didn't have

617
00:52:16.16 --> 00:52:17.48
a legitimate answer.

618
00:52:17.48 --> 00:52:18.48
LIBOLVE goes off.

619
00:52:18.48 --> 00:52:19.72
Nobody ever needs to tell me that again.

620
00:52:19.72 --> 00:52:24.80
Yeah, I feel like that's, I don't like such a critical component, the tone.

621
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:28.32
But you can say the same exact question, but you say it in all these different tone.

622
00:52:28.32 --> 00:52:32.24
So like, like, what were you, you know, how you, like, you always say this, like, what

623
00:52:32.24 --> 00:52:37.44
were you thinking there on that thing or that went down as opposed to, what were you thinking,

624
00:52:37.44 --> 00:52:39.08
you know, like that kind of thing, that's common.

625
00:52:39.08 --> 00:52:40.96
Well, you thinking like you're so dumb.

626
00:52:40.96 --> 00:52:46.20
And I think the factor is there is that I recognize, I truly recognize that I could be learning

627
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:49.12
something and there might be some kind of, I don't see, and I'll tell you what,

628
00:52:49.12 --> 00:52:54.20
and they've talked about this earlier, man, combat is humbling, and I've been in situations

629
00:52:54.20 --> 00:52:57.28
combat where I did not have control.

630
00:52:57.28 --> 00:53:00.48
And I did not do good.

631
00:53:00.48 --> 00:53:04.96
And I look at those situations, and I don't know if that's going to happen again in, in

632
00:53:04.96 --> 00:53:05.96
whatever situation.

633
00:53:05.96 --> 00:53:10.60
So my mind is not sitting there saying, I know everything, because I know I don't.

634
00:53:10.60 --> 00:53:15.44
So when I'm asking those questions, I am legitimately asking you the question, hey, Echo,

635
00:53:15.44 --> 00:53:18.28
what, what, what do you think when you, when you splice this thing together or what

636
00:53:18.28 --> 00:53:23.24
are you thinking when you, when you posted this thing on that video, what's the purpose

637
00:53:23.24 --> 00:53:26.32
of that, you know, and I actually want to know.

638
00:53:26.32 --> 00:53:29.80
So that's why I'm not saying Echo, why the hell did you post that?

639
00:53:29.80 --> 00:53:30.80
You know what I mean?

640
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:37.60
I generally, I genuinely am not, I'm not overconfident and don't think I know everything.

641
00:53:37.60 --> 00:53:41.48
That was one of the biggest lessons, in addition to this leadership, the most important

642
00:53:41.48 --> 00:53:44.72
thing on the battlefield, one of the other big lessons, Aaron was humility.

643
00:53:44.72 --> 00:53:48.72
And that's, you know, at that time, I had deployed to Iraq before, so I was a one-potin

644
00:53:48.72 --> 00:53:51.72
wonder, one cruise wonder, exactly.

645
00:53:51.72 --> 00:53:54.40
Wow, you pumped, chill.

646
00:53:54.40 --> 00:54:00.68
And you really feel, that happens when you have, I have deployed or I've been overseas,

647
00:54:00.68 --> 00:54:03.88
and I've done a few combat operations, you get that in your bill, and yet you don't even

648
00:54:03.88 --> 00:54:09.28
realize what it feels like to be overwhelmed, to have things that are out of your control,

649
00:54:09.28 --> 00:54:12.60
to have the enemy flank you or do something that you hadn't for seeing.

650
00:54:12.60 --> 00:54:18.88
And I think those just sustained combat operations for almost seven months in Ramadi, just

651
00:54:18.88 --> 00:54:24.16
a day in and day out of intense gun battles was something that it was humbling.

652
00:54:24.16 --> 00:54:26.60
And I think that was one of the biggest lessons that we were able to come back and pass

653
00:54:26.60 --> 00:54:31.000
on to others was just, wow, if you think you got to figure it out, you haven't really

654
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.40
done anything to you.

655
00:54:32.40 --> 00:54:39.84
Yeah, and the other thing that happens, and this is actually, to exactly to your point,

656
00:54:39.84 --> 00:54:45.20
everybody goes overseas, and they do some combat operations, and they don't get challenged,

657
00:54:45.20 --> 00:54:49.80
they don't get tested truly, and it actually falsely increases their confidence.

658
00:54:49.80 --> 00:54:53.44
And we see this in the business world too, like you have a company that came out of the

659
00:54:53.44 --> 00:54:57.48
gate, and they just timed things right, they were ahead of the curve, and also they're

660
00:54:57.48 --> 00:55:02.32
doing fantastic, and they think they can make no mistakes, and they're not humble.

661
00:55:02.32 --> 00:55:08.32
So they're success, they're success actually makes them get arrogant.

662
00:55:08.32 --> 00:55:11.52
And I mean, this is real obvious, I mean, look at Ronda Rousey, right?

663
00:55:11.52 --> 00:55:16.16
Ronda Rousey, she thought, hey, I'm good to go, I'm going to beat all these people, and

664
00:55:16.16 --> 00:55:18.76
that that arrogance will bite you.

665
00:55:18.76 --> 00:55:25.24
And so I think we saw that in the seal teams where guys go overseas do a quote on quote,

666
00:55:25.24 --> 00:55:31.92
combat deployment, they'd get some experience, but it wasn't like hardcore, sustained combat

667
00:55:31.92 --> 00:55:33.56
operations.

668
00:55:33.56 --> 00:55:39.32
And so that that actually, it would be a negative, it almost be better not to have

669
00:55:39.32 --> 00:55:43.16
any experience, almost, it's probably better to have some experience, but you definitely,

670
00:55:43.16 --> 00:55:46.36
so my point is whether you're in combat, whether you're going into combat, whether you've

671
00:55:46.36 --> 00:55:49.76
been in combat, whether you're a business, whether you're in a sport, just because you've

672
00:55:49.76 --> 00:55:54.88
had some success, don't start cutting corners, don't let don't get arrogant.

673
00:55:54.88 --> 00:55:58.44
I mean, this is common sense stuff, but we still see it all the time.

674
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:03.68
Yeah, when you're in the mix, you just, you're just compelled to do it, like I'm winning.

675
00:56:03.68 --> 00:56:06.28
Yeah, so I don't need to train any harder.

676
00:56:06.28 --> 00:56:08.000
I don't need to train any harder.

677
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I'm good to go.

678
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.56
It's like that guy running the mile, you know, the guy who's running the mile, right?

679
00:56:12.56 --> 00:56:16.40
He's beating everyone, he's winning, but then you got the guy who's had some adversity

680
00:56:16.40 --> 00:56:20.28
through the four laps and at the end, he's turning it on, and the guy who ran the

681
00:56:20.28 --> 00:56:22.76
might as I call him cruising in the guy past his own.

682
00:56:22.76 --> 00:56:23.76
Same thing.

683
00:56:23.76 --> 00:56:29.24
So as these would be the underdog, because it's, you can just take advantage of, of, of, of

684
00:56:29.24 --> 00:56:34.60
overconfidence of arrogance of someone who just doesn't think, yeah, it's like, you're

685
00:56:34.60 --> 00:56:39.08
saying, like, I'd go into Iraq, we don't, we don't a bunch of operations, but I'll

686
00:56:39.08 --> 00:56:44.44
tell you, in my mind, I didn't feel like I had been tested, I knew, and a lot, I felt

687
00:56:44.44 --> 00:56:47.76
like, hey, we still got to be, that's why we always thought, worst case scenario, what's

688
00:56:47.76 --> 00:56:50.84
the worst thing that's going to happen, what's how bad can this get, that's what I was

689
00:56:50.84 --> 00:56:53.08
always looking at, and still look at.

690
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:56.08
And when we were running training, when I was running training, when you were running

691
00:56:56.08 --> 00:56:57.08
training, we were always looking at that.

692
00:56:57.08 --> 00:56:59.96
What, we want, I want the training to be harder than combat, you know?

693
00:56:59.96 --> 00:57:03.72
So keep your ego in check, people.

694
00:57:03.72 --> 00:57:05.44
And we, we talked to leaders about that all the time.

695
00:57:05.44 --> 00:57:10.40
I just had a conversation with the leader, not too long ago about how he's telling me everything

696
00:57:10.40 --> 00:57:11.40
is going good.

697
00:57:11.40 --> 00:57:12.80
He's implemented the stuff we talked about.

698
00:57:12.80 --> 00:57:14.60
He's, he's rocking, rolling these principles.

699
00:57:14.60 --> 00:57:15.60
His team's going great.

700
00:57:15.60 --> 00:57:19.000
I'm like, okay, well, we're going to go bad.

701
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
We're going to go bad.

702
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.20
You know, where, what, what did you miss?

703
00:57:22.20 --> 00:57:24.24
What risk did you, you know, are you not taking the proper steps?

704
00:57:24.24 --> 00:57:25.64
What's the worst case scenario that can happen?

705
00:57:25.64 --> 00:57:29.04
I think good leaders are going to be doing that all the time.

706
00:57:29.04 --> 00:57:31.56
Never going to be satisfied, always thinking, what did I miss?

707
00:57:31.56 --> 00:57:33.24
There's always this little butterflies there.

708
00:57:33.24 --> 00:57:36.84
And I think when you're, when you're running an op, I think I got it all figured out.

709
00:57:36.84 --> 00:57:38.04
What bad could possibly happen?

710
00:57:38.04 --> 00:57:40.24
We're going to crush the enemy.

711
00:57:40.24 --> 00:57:41.24
Watch out.

712
00:57:41.24 --> 00:57:42.64
It's, it's going to go bad for you.

713
00:57:42.64 --> 00:57:43.64
All right.

714
00:57:43.64 --> 00:57:45.64
Moving on to the next question.

715
00:57:45.64 --> 00:57:48.12
I'll tell you though.

716
00:57:48.12 --> 00:57:52.92
That's easy about being the underdog is that not much is expected out of you.

717
00:57:52.92 --> 00:57:56.52
So even if you fail it, everyone's like whatever, it doesn't throw up any kind of red flag.

718
00:57:56.52 --> 00:57:57.68
It doesn't move the needle.

719
00:57:57.68 --> 00:58:03.12
But when you do good, it moves the needle because no one expects much out of you.

720
00:58:03.12 --> 00:58:06.68
Yep, being the underdog is the easier position.

721
00:58:06.68 --> 00:58:07.68
Less pressure.

722
00:58:07.68 --> 00:58:09.68
Yeah, it can be seen that way.

723
00:58:09.68 --> 00:58:10.68
Yeah.

724
00:58:10.68 --> 00:58:11.68
For sure.

725
00:58:11.68 --> 00:58:12.68
Next question.

726
00:58:12.68 --> 00:58:14.68
Uh, here we go.

727
00:58:14.68 --> 00:58:25.24
Jocquan life, what once the crisis started in Benghazi was a QRF practical.

728
00:58:25.24 --> 00:58:28.24
You know, this is something that there's been so much discussion.

729
00:58:28.24 --> 00:58:34.28
Obviously with the, they heated political debate, you know, election season.

730
00:58:34.28 --> 00:58:36.28
And a lot's been said about Benghazi.

731
00:58:36.28 --> 00:58:43.000
And I think what bothers me so much about that is the answer is yes.

732
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:49.32
Of course, a QRF is practical and a QRF should have been set up and ready to go in the event

733
00:58:49.32 --> 00:58:50.24
that this happened.

734
00:58:50.24 --> 00:58:56.84
And so the issue with this is, you know, with Benghazi and why it's a big deal and why it's

735
00:58:56.84 --> 00:59:08.000
important is a particularly for those of us in the military is because when US military

736
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:15.88
personnel are employees of the US government anyway, are out in harm's way and they're

737
00:59:15.88 --> 00:59:19.76
calling for help.

738
00:59:19.76 --> 00:59:25.36
Leaders, real leaders are going to step up and get that help to them and make it happen.

739
00:59:25.36 --> 00:59:32.68
And I think, you know, what, whether or not a QRF, which is a quick, quick reaction

740
00:59:32.68 --> 00:59:36.36
force, we're talking about sending in a, you know, a force, maybe it's Marines, maybe

741
00:59:36.36 --> 00:59:39.80
soldiers, maybe special operations, for maybe it's just air support, maybe it's air support,

742
00:59:39.80 --> 00:59:45.80
close air support, which could have gotten there certainly, you know, in the matter of hours,

743
00:59:45.80 --> 00:59:52.04
it's those things would probably have made a huge difference on that battle field.

744
00:59:52.04 --> 00:59:57.24
With you have saved the lives of Thai woods, who was our team made in Glint, Glindority,

745
00:59:57.24 --> 00:59:59.72
another team made.

746
00:59:59.72 --> 01:00:03.52
And those, the two state department officials lost their lives, including the ambassador

747
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:07.32
Chris Stevens, I don't know.

748
01:00:07.32 --> 01:00:10.60
I don't know that it would have saved their lives and it no one could say that, but that's

749
01:00:10.60 --> 01:00:15.68
not what leaders are asking themselves, when they don't know the outcome, I think a true,

750
01:00:15.68 --> 01:00:20.16
good leader is going to, is going to, when bad things are happening is going to, say,

751
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:21.16
how can we resolve this?

752
01:00:21.16 --> 01:00:22.16
How can we help this guys?

753
01:00:22.16 --> 01:00:25.60
And I think the, the hard thing when you look at the scenario is from everything that

754
01:00:25.60 --> 01:00:30.64
we've seen and understand about what happened in the wake of Benghazi is when the call

755
01:00:30.64 --> 01:00:34.000
came in that US forces are under attack.

756
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.48
The immediate response was how can we twist this?

757
01:00:38.48 --> 01:00:41.72
How can we, how can we make this better for us politically?

758
01:00:41.72 --> 01:00:42.72
Spin it.

759
01:00:42.72 --> 01:00:43.72
How can we spin it?

760
01:00:43.72 --> 01:00:44.72
Yeah, exactly.

761
01:00:44.72 --> 01:00:45.72
So how can we do that?

762
01:00:45.72 --> 01:00:50.68
Well, we Libya had to be, because that was the party line of the time, Libya had to be

763
01:00:50.68 --> 01:00:51.92
a big win.

764
01:00:51.92 --> 01:00:57.08
We liberated Libya, you know, US forces went in air power, liberated Libya from the, you

765
01:00:57.08 --> 01:01:00.60
know, evil dictator, more markadofi.

766
01:01:00.60 --> 01:01:01.84
That has to be a victory force.

767
01:01:01.84 --> 01:01:06.28
We can't say that al-Qaeda or terrorist groups have taken over the threat levels there.

768
01:01:06.28 --> 01:01:08.28
So we have to put a spin on this.

769
01:01:08.28 --> 01:01:11.88
So let's, let's, let's, we can't say that there's a threat.

770
01:01:11.88 --> 01:01:17.44
Let's come up with a story about the video and how the video and flame, you know,

771
01:01:17.44 --> 01:01:20.76
hatred against Americans and and blame that.

772
01:01:20.76 --> 01:01:22.52
And so that was the crisis response.

773
01:01:22.52 --> 01:01:28.84
And no one ever said, send every asset we have to help those guys.

774
01:01:28.84 --> 01:01:34.000
And you know, there's all this, you know, the paperwork and the permissions that are required

775
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.88
to enter another country's airspace.

776
01:01:35.88 --> 01:01:38.28
Let me tell you something.

777
01:01:38.28 --> 01:01:43.88
If someone, if the president, if, if the very top says, get US aircraft there now, they're

778
01:01:43.88 --> 01:01:45.12
going to get there now.

779
01:01:45.12 --> 01:01:48.28
And what is, what is Libya going to do for us?

780
01:01:48.28 --> 01:01:52.16
I mean, particularly when they're a nation that's not, I mean, they've got a pseudo government

781
01:01:52.16 --> 01:01:54.88
at that point post, you know, post revolution.

782
01:01:54.88 --> 01:01:57.04
So it was, it's a travesty.

783
01:01:57.04 --> 01:02:03.44
And I think it's a real stain on American honor that when US troops were in harm's way,

784
01:02:03.44 --> 01:02:08.64
calling for help, America did not send help.

785
01:02:08.64 --> 01:02:11.12
So a couple things from my perspective.

786
01:02:11.12 --> 01:02:15.88
Number one, and you kind of touched on this, the preparation was awful.

787
01:02:15.88 --> 01:02:21.08
There's all kinds of documents showing that these guys at, at the felt the threat, analyze

788
01:02:21.08 --> 01:02:25.28
the threat, knew the threat was real and did not get the support that they wanted down

789
01:02:25.28 --> 01:02:26.28
there.

790
01:02:26.28 --> 01:02:28.32
That's just step number one.

791
01:02:28.32 --> 01:02:33.84
So from the beginning, never mind once this, once once, once, once, once, once the crisis

792
01:02:33.84 --> 01:02:36.12
started, the crisis shouldn't have started.

793
01:02:36.12 --> 01:02:37.52
You should be proactive.

794
01:02:37.52 --> 01:02:40.52
You should be aggressive in your contingency planning.

795
01:02:40.52 --> 01:02:42.76
You should be aggressive in your security measures.

796
01:02:42.76 --> 01:02:48.32
You should be aggressive against a known and quantifiable threat all the time.

797
01:02:48.32 --> 01:02:50.92
So so there's number one, there's the first failure.

798
01:02:50.92 --> 01:02:53.04
Then the second failure, you already said it.

799
01:02:53.04 --> 01:02:55.80
I'm going to tell you what, you got American troops in harm's way.

800
01:02:55.80 --> 01:03:00.40
We are going to do everything possible to get there now.

801
01:03:00.40 --> 01:03:03.80
And you know what, how long is that crisis going to last?

802
01:03:03.80 --> 01:03:05.04
You don't know.

803
01:03:05.04 --> 01:03:07.48
You don't know how long the crisis is going to last.

804
01:03:07.48 --> 01:03:11.36
So if the crisis starts and I know it's going on, I'm sending help.

805
01:03:11.36 --> 01:03:13.68
And I'm sending the first, the first help I can get out that I'm sending there.

806
01:03:13.68 --> 01:03:16.24
And it seems like an established, more help I'm going to send them to.

807
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:19.40
And if the crisis is over and the, and the embassy is over running 20 minutes or we're

808
01:03:19.40 --> 01:03:22.48
too late, okay, we did our best.

809
01:03:22.48 --> 01:03:30.64
If the crisis lasts six hours and the, the patriotic heroes that stood the line and fought,

810
01:03:30.64 --> 01:03:35.36
held those guys for five hours or seven hours long enough to get support there.

811
01:03:35.36 --> 01:03:39.88
Then guess what, we win everyone's alive and we did our job.

812
01:03:39.88 --> 01:03:43.48
So it was just a disaster across the board.

813
01:03:43.48 --> 01:03:50.12
And like you said, a real, a real, not only a stain on American presence in the world

814
01:03:50.12 --> 01:04:00.20
that they have an ambassador, a sitting ambassador murdered, but our reaction to it was completely,

815
01:04:00.20 --> 01:04:06.44
it was, it was a travesty and not to mention, of course, the loss of some real heroes

816
01:04:06.44 --> 01:04:14.08
that stood up and held the line, even without the support that they needed from their

817
01:04:14.08 --> 01:04:18.44
country at that time, which is hard for me to even say.

818
01:04:18.44 --> 01:04:23.16
I'll, I'll back us down a little bit, take a little breath, throw you a little softball

819
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:25.56
from the, from the troopers out there.

820
01:04:25.56 --> 01:04:29.000
And this is actually something might be a softball lake, but I know you're passionate

821
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.80
about this.

822
01:04:31.80 --> 01:04:35.88
What's the best barbecue in Texas?

823
01:04:35.88 --> 01:04:40.88
That's, those are fighting words right there because people have their favorites.

824
01:04:40.88 --> 01:04:41.88
That's for sure.

825
01:04:41.88 --> 01:04:45.000
You know what, today we're going to talk about, you know, politics, we're going to talk

826
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.12
about religion, we're going to talk, I said, life, we're, they're asking about barbecue.

827
01:04:48.12 --> 01:04:52.60
I don't know man, touch you subject, heavy, we went, I want to get there man, I don't want

828
01:04:52.60 --> 01:04:55.000
to, I don't want to get a bunch of Twitter haters.

829
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.12
Say the wrong barbecue, I don't know.

830
01:04:57.12 --> 01:05:01.36
Any two Texans going to take their barbecue very seriously, there's no doubt about that.

831
01:05:01.36 --> 01:05:07.20
I, it's, it's certainly a passion down there in Texas, and it's, it's a big deal, but I

832
01:05:07.20 --> 01:05:12.56
got to go with, I got to go with Cooper's bit barbecue, whereas I know, it's in Lano,

833
01:05:12.56 --> 01:05:17.84
Texas, the original, they've had a couple of, opened up and Austin area now, but it

834
01:05:17.84 --> 01:05:18.84
is, it's awesome.

835
01:05:18.84 --> 01:05:24.68
You walk in that place, you get to just a big plastic tray, and there's just giant

836
01:05:24.68 --> 01:05:29.20
smokers around, you go up and you just like, I want that piece of brisket, I want those

837
01:05:29.20 --> 01:05:34.48
ribs, I want that sausage, and you just take it and you weigh it, and then you just get

838
01:05:34.48 --> 01:05:35.48
after it.

839
01:05:35.48 --> 01:05:38.000
Jocca, you probably wouldn't like, I mean, I know that now that you're going to vegan,

840
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
you probably, yeah.

841
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.60
Jocca was not a vegan either for those out there, they're listening, he is very, very

842
01:05:44.60 --> 01:05:47.60
much a carnivore.

843
01:05:47.60 --> 01:05:48.60
Awesome.

844
01:05:48.60 --> 01:05:50.32
Wait, what's this body again?

845
01:05:50.32 --> 01:05:53.60
It's Cooper's bit barbecue in Lano, Texas.

846
01:05:53.60 --> 01:06:02.16
All right, next question, is there a way to practice, is it back to leadership?

847
01:06:02.16 --> 01:06:05.04
Is there a way to practice the hard conversations?

848
01:06:05.04 --> 01:06:08.60
I'm not known for my delicate finesse.

849
01:06:08.60 --> 01:06:15.16
Well, I'm glad you're not known for your delicate finesse because neither am I, generally.

850
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:21.000
I'm a pretty direct guy, and I'm a de-falte aggressive leader, I think, by nature, but

851
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.52
that's something that I learned from Jocca, really, you always use jujitsu as an analogy,

852
01:06:27.52 --> 01:06:33.84
and how the direct approach, and particularly, as a white boat wonder myself, when you're

853
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:38.000
trying to jujitsu, it's like, you're going for the three moves that you know, people know

854
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.48
it's coming and it's very easy to defend.

855
01:06:40.48 --> 01:06:44.20
So if you can set up like, I'm going for this, but then I'm going for something else,

856
01:06:44.20 --> 01:06:49.88
and it's that indirect approach, generally, generally is more successful.

857
01:06:49.88 --> 01:06:53.44
You just talked about that with the ice cream, ride the bicycle, your daughter.

858
01:06:53.44 --> 01:06:57.84
So I mean, I think that's, there's so many examples that we're receiving, and often that

859
01:06:57.84 --> 01:07:01.32
direct approach, a my way to do it this way, just doesn't get the job done.

860
01:07:01.32 --> 01:07:05.12
I think, is there a way to practice the hard conversations?

861
01:07:05.12 --> 01:07:12.88
100% there is, and so many people think they're above rehearsals role play.

862
01:07:12.88 --> 01:07:16.72
Those are those are things that are critical to seal performers in the battlefield.

863
01:07:16.72 --> 01:07:23.92
I think a lot of people don't realize that we actually, we do rehearsals and walk throughs

864
01:07:23.92 --> 01:07:26.48
before every single operation.

865
01:07:26.48 --> 01:07:28.08
And we try to mimic that.

866
01:07:28.08 --> 01:07:29.96
Maybe it's, you know, we're out training in the desert.

867
01:07:29.96 --> 01:07:35.16
We might even have like, you know, we might lay out rocks or put tape on the ground, so

868
01:07:35.16 --> 01:07:36.16
it mimics bill.

869
01:07:36.16 --> 01:07:41.76
If we, if there's not actual buildings to use for training facilities or, and we have

870
01:07:41.76 --> 01:07:45.80
everyone stand together in their sticks, and we know who's getting on the helicopter here,

871
01:07:45.80 --> 01:07:47.84
and these guys are going to be on the second helicopter there.

872
01:07:47.84 --> 01:07:51.32
Those are the kind of things that allow people in the dark of night when it's crazy and

873
01:07:51.32 --> 01:07:54.48
it's chaotic to go to the right place, do what they're supposed to do.

874
01:07:54.48 --> 01:07:58.56
Everything is simple as unloading from a vehicle.

875
01:07:58.56 --> 01:07:59.88
Just, we would practice that.

876
01:07:59.88 --> 01:08:05.12
We had this giant truck that we use.

877
01:08:05.12 --> 01:08:11.000
When the ID threats sort of getting really bad and Iraq initially, seal, seal, soldiers were

878
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.04
riding in the back on benches in the back of a home.

879
01:08:14.04 --> 01:08:17.08
They kind of an open bed like a truck, truck type back.

880
01:08:17.08 --> 01:08:20.36
And then the ID threat, the roadside bomb threats sort of getting so dangerous that we had

881
01:08:20.36 --> 01:08:22.48
to put guys inside armor.

882
01:08:22.48 --> 01:08:26.32
And so that means that the home piece, we're going to only care five guys, you know, if

883
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:27.64
you don't have guys in the back.

884
01:08:27.64 --> 01:08:30.92
So, so we had to take this giant, we call it the man truck.

885
01:08:30.92 --> 01:08:33.04
And we, I think we nicknamed it big Ziv.

886
01:08:33.04 --> 01:08:34.52
So, it was our truck.

887
01:08:34.52 --> 01:08:41.22
And it was a big five-ton truck and, you know, a flat bed truck and they, I don't know

888
01:08:41.22 --> 01:08:44.000
if previous seals or the army had done it, it worries.

889
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.12
But we had welded these a quarter inch steel plates around it.

890
01:08:49.12 --> 01:08:53.16
And then we had, then we had sandbags in the bottom of it.

891
01:08:53.16 --> 01:08:55.20
So that was our protection.

892
01:08:55.20 --> 01:08:58.60
And most of the sandbags were like torn up because of boots going in and out.

893
01:08:58.60 --> 01:09:00.56
And so you're just sitting on sand.

894
01:09:00.56 --> 01:09:04.16
So if you got blown up, it would not have provided a whole lot of protection from

895
01:09:04.16 --> 01:09:05.16
the way.

896
01:09:05.16 --> 01:09:07.52
But getting it out of the truck is substantial.

897
01:09:07.52 --> 01:09:12.28
When you got 20 guys sitting in the back of that truck and there, you know, with some of

898
01:09:12.28 --> 01:09:16.40
our guys, Iraqi soldiers that were with us, our junkies.

899
01:09:16.40 --> 01:09:20.48
And you got to open, swing open this giant, heavy, you know, quarter inch steel doors

900
01:09:20.48 --> 01:09:21.48
in the back.

901
01:09:21.48 --> 01:09:24.56
And then you got to put a ladder out and everyone's got to climb down that ladder.

902
01:09:24.56 --> 01:09:26.28
That takes some time.

903
01:09:26.28 --> 01:09:27.92
And guess what?

904
01:09:27.92 --> 01:09:30.92
Back that, that can turn into three-stooges real quick.

905
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:31.92
No doubt.

906
01:09:31.92 --> 01:09:32.92
Just follow up.

907
01:09:32.92 --> 01:09:37.04
We've had guys fall off and trucks like that and dislocate their shoulders and literally

908
01:09:37.04 --> 01:09:38.52
have to get sent home.

909
01:09:38.52 --> 01:09:42.88
But more important, if it takes three minutes or four minutes to do something like that,

910
01:09:42.88 --> 01:09:47.000
that's three or four minutes that you don't have guns pointed in every direction.

911
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And it's critical.

912
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.88
So we had to practice that and practice that until we could do it in less than 30 seconds.

913
01:09:52.88 --> 01:09:56.16
And then if we have two different assault forces, we got to make sure assault ones line

914
01:09:56.16 --> 01:09:58.80
up on the left side of the road, assault two's line up on the right side of the road.

915
01:09:58.80 --> 01:10:02.72
I mean, those things that you, we have to practice that over and over and over again.

916
01:10:02.72 --> 01:10:04.08
And it seems really juvenile.

917
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:06.20
It seems very elementary.

918
01:10:06.20 --> 01:10:12.04
But if you took the time to practice that performance, your performance is so much better

919
01:10:12.04 --> 01:10:15.28
when you actually get out of the dark and night, the chaos of being an unknown area.

920
01:10:15.28 --> 01:10:18.76
And we're worried about bad guys and where they are and all those things happen and make

921
01:10:18.76 --> 01:10:20.60
it sure people went to the place they need to go.

922
01:10:20.60 --> 01:10:25.20
So having those conversations, practicing it, sitting down with someone who understands how

923
01:10:25.20 --> 01:10:28.84
that person might respond for a tough conversation, role play.

924
01:10:28.84 --> 01:10:34.84
They try different scenarios, whether it's a softball or easy scenario, it's a difficult

925
01:10:34.84 --> 01:10:37.48
scenario and it's the worst case scenario.

926
01:10:37.48 --> 01:10:38.56
The worst case scenario.

927
01:10:38.56 --> 01:10:40.88
So the more you do that, the better it is.

928
01:10:40.88 --> 01:10:44.52
And this is something that Jack and I have done quite a bit with companies we work with

929
01:10:44.52 --> 01:10:45.52
is role play.

930
01:10:45.52 --> 01:10:46.52
You got to counsel again.

931
01:10:46.52 --> 01:10:49.08
And it's easy just to say, well, you screwed up, you were firing you.

932
01:10:49.08 --> 01:10:51.12
But if it's, this is a good guy.

933
01:10:51.12 --> 01:10:52.12
He messed up.

934
01:10:52.12 --> 01:10:55.64
You got to try to get him on board to use this plan or you have to chalk him down from

935
01:10:55.64 --> 01:10:59.60
doing this out and you know, he did something out and down that is making the company look

936
01:10:59.60 --> 01:11:00.60
bad.

937
01:11:00.60 --> 01:11:01.88
Whatever it is.

938
01:11:01.88 --> 01:11:04.96
And you have to talk to them and that role play is critical and it makes you better

939
01:11:04.96 --> 01:11:07.44
and it enables you to perform better.

940
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:09.44
And so yes, you have to do that.

941
01:11:09.44 --> 01:11:10.44
They're hers.

942
01:11:10.44 --> 01:11:11.44
Yep.

943
01:11:11.44 --> 01:11:15.56
Three or four iterations with someone dealing with in a role play scenario.

944
01:11:15.56 --> 01:11:16.56
They get better.

945
01:11:16.56 --> 01:11:18.12
You can literally see them get better.

946
01:11:18.12 --> 01:11:20.12
It's pretty cool.

947
01:11:20.12 --> 01:11:23.12
We got pretty good getting in and out of big zev.

948
01:11:23.12 --> 01:11:24.60
Nice.

949
01:11:24.60 --> 01:11:25.60
All right.

950
01:11:25.60 --> 01:11:31.72
Next question, there was recent news about combatives in the seal teams.

951
01:11:31.72 --> 01:11:36.08
What was the evolution towards MMA?

952
01:11:36.08 --> 01:11:44.40
So the seal teams has gone through a whole plethora of various kind of hand-to-hand combat

953
01:11:44.40 --> 01:11:45.40
type things.

954
01:11:45.40 --> 01:11:51.36
When I first came in, there was something called scars.

955
01:11:51.36 --> 01:11:55.000
And it's good for scientific, something, something, something, something.

956
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.64
It was, it sort of looked like a Kung Fu.

957
01:11:59.64 --> 01:12:05.68
Yeah, it was very, actually I think it was based on San Su, right?

958
01:12:05.68 --> 01:12:07.000
Which is a martial art.

959
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.12
Anyways, so that was kind of when I showed up there, then we kind of morphed towards

960
01:12:13.12 --> 01:12:16.48
something a little bit more modern and then we morphed towards something else.

961
01:12:16.48 --> 01:12:21.04
And so we were constantly kind of looking and searching for something that was efficient.

962
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:27.52
We ended up going with this one contractor for several years.

963
01:12:27.52 --> 01:12:34.08
And so use this one contractor for several years and then eventually, especially once

964
01:12:34.08 --> 01:12:35.92
the war started.

965
01:12:35.92 --> 01:12:41.96
And we had guys on a regular basis doing hand-to-hand combat against the enemy.

966
01:12:41.96 --> 01:12:45.60
And for those who don't understand when that would happen, if we go into a building and

967
01:12:45.60 --> 01:12:48.36
there's people in there that don't have weapons.

968
01:12:48.36 --> 01:12:50.72
Well, you can't just gun them all down.

969
01:12:50.72 --> 01:12:52.08
You have to get control of them.

970
01:12:52.08 --> 01:12:55.36
If they're military age males, you've probably got a cuff on you got to get them down to

971
01:12:55.36 --> 01:12:56.68
the ground, you got to control them.

972
01:12:56.68 --> 01:12:59.12
Now there's a whole variety of things that can happen.

973
01:12:59.12 --> 01:13:04.04
But guy can be unarmed but literally combat-if, you know, he can square up and say, okay,

974
01:13:04.04 --> 01:13:05.04
it's on.

975
01:13:05.04 --> 01:13:06.04
We've seen that.

976
01:13:06.04 --> 01:13:09.24
And people might be surprised to hear that people actually do that.

977
01:13:09.24 --> 01:13:13.20
You know, you got a gang of big tough seals there that are going to put you down.

978
01:13:13.20 --> 01:13:15.36
We've had multiple people like not comply.

979
01:13:15.36 --> 01:13:17.36
Oh, you're not going to put me down.

980
01:13:17.36 --> 01:13:19.96
And it doesn't usually go too well for them.

981
01:13:19.96 --> 01:13:21.44
So that's one of the spectrum.

982
01:13:21.44 --> 01:13:24.88
Then you go down the spectrum where it's someone that just is scared and they're frozen

983
01:13:24.88 --> 01:13:25.88
with fear.

984
01:13:25.88 --> 01:13:29.20
But you're yelling at them to get down and air or big, which is, you know, your air

985
01:13:29.20 --> 01:13:30.20
or big's not great.

986
01:13:30.20 --> 01:13:31.20
You're yelling at them.

987
01:13:31.20 --> 01:13:32.20
They're scared.

988
01:13:32.20 --> 01:13:33.20
They freeze.

989
01:13:33.20 --> 01:13:34.20
So now what are you going to do?

990
01:13:34.20 --> 01:13:35.20
You can't just say they're going to keep yelling at them.

991
01:13:35.20 --> 01:13:36.20
You've got to get them to the ground, get them to control.

992
01:13:36.20 --> 01:13:37.48
So you continue to clearance.

993
01:13:37.48 --> 01:13:39.96
Then there's people that are going to-so you've got-and they all the way down to someone

994
01:13:39.96 --> 01:13:42.92
that just, you know, they see, they see you, they put their hands up, they lay down.

995
01:13:42.92 --> 01:13:43.92
That's great.

996
01:13:43.92 --> 01:13:44.92
That's easy.

997
01:13:44.92 --> 01:13:51.48
As we started getting into these scenarios on a regular basis, we realized that the system

998
01:13:51.48 --> 01:13:53.80
that had been taught was ineffective.

999
01:13:53.80 --> 01:13:59.32
And also luckily we had a bunch of guys and sealed teams that were into due-jitsu and

1000
01:13:59.32 --> 01:14:01.60
mojitai and resting and MMA in general.

1001
01:14:01.60 --> 01:14:06.64
And so that kind of came in and started-people started saying, hey, why don't you just

1002
01:14:06.64 --> 01:14:08.36
do this?

1003
01:14:08.36 --> 01:14:10.96
And this will actually get a person under control.

1004
01:14:10.96 --> 01:14:15.32
And actually you told a good story to me today when we were talking about jujitsu about

1005
01:14:15.32 --> 01:14:16.32
that, tell that.

1006
01:14:16.32 --> 01:14:20.92
That's a good little explanation of where we were and where we got through.

1007
01:14:20.92 --> 01:14:26.40
Yeah, my first butthon, we went through that training and that was our prisoner handling

1008
01:14:26.40 --> 01:14:27.40
training.

1009
01:14:27.40 --> 01:14:31.96
So that's what we did and we practiced handling prisoners and searching them and put them

1010
01:14:31.96 --> 01:14:34.28
on the ground all that stuff, handle them.

1011
01:14:34.28 --> 01:14:35.96
And so, you know, we're told this is the way to do it.

1012
01:14:35.96 --> 01:14:40.92
This is, you know, well, when we start going against role players, I remember one in particular

1013
01:14:40.92 --> 01:14:46.80
we're going against, we're in the kill house and we're moving through and of course we're,

1014
01:14:46.80 --> 01:14:47.80
this isn't live fire.

1015
01:14:47.80 --> 01:14:48.80
You're going to get to role players.

1016
01:14:48.80 --> 01:14:52.44
They're shooting back at you with simunition, which is a paint round through our actual

1017
01:14:52.44 --> 01:14:53.44
weapons.

1018
01:14:53.44 --> 01:14:55.48
It's great training because then you have to deal with people.

1019
01:14:55.48 --> 01:14:57.28
You have to actually wrestle with people.

1020
01:14:57.28 --> 01:15:01.24
You actually have to engage targets or they're shooting back at you outstanding training.

1021
01:15:01.24 --> 01:15:03.16
And we talked about that before.

1022
01:15:03.16 --> 01:15:08.80
But it is one of the things that really stood out to me was I remember one particular

1023
01:15:08.80 --> 01:15:12.92
guy, one of the role players was a pretty large guy.

1024
01:15:12.92 --> 01:15:17.92
I mean, he's probably 6'4, 6'5, like 250 pound guy, big guy.

1025
01:15:17.92 --> 01:15:20.76
And me and this guy wasn't a seal.

1026
01:15:20.76 --> 01:15:21.76
He wasn't a seal.

1027
01:15:21.76 --> 01:15:22.76
I think he was a gunners made or something.

1028
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:24.48
He was just violent cheering to come up and be a role player.

1029
01:15:24.48 --> 01:15:26.68
Great, you know, helps us with training.

1030
01:15:26.68 --> 01:15:30.000
And so, you know, a small role player, you're able to get them down the ground, hold them

1031
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.24
and, you know, get a search on them.

1032
01:15:33.24 --> 01:15:38.76
And me and another one of our guys, who is a big guy.

1033
01:15:38.76 --> 01:15:40.76
This guy arms big around my legs.

1034
01:15:40.76 --> 01:15:44.76
A seal was a large, large man, very strong guy.

1035
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:46.52
And we grabbed this guy.

1036
01:15:46.52 --> 01:15:49.16
We're trying to get him the ground and he's not being compliant.

1037
01:15:49.16 --> 01:15:51.32
He's been, he's resistin' us.

1038
01:15:51.32 --> 01:15:52.68
And it's hard.

1039
01:15:52.68 --> 01:15:55.60
I mean, this is difficult for me and this other guy.

1040
01:15:55.60 --> 01:15:56.88
And we're not, we're not small guys.

1041
01:15:56.88 --> 01:15:58.12
I mean, we're strong guys.

1042
01:15:58.12 --> 01:16:00.80
We're, we're getting this guy to the ground, but he's not cooperating.

1043
01:16:00.80 --> 01:16:02.80
And we're having a hard time keeping him down.

1044
01:16:02.80 --> 01:16:05.20
Another one of our guys who was actually a lot smaller.

1045
01:16:05.20 --> 01:16:09.000
So he was probably 180 pound guy, I'm 200 pounds and the other seal was a scram.

1046
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.52
It's probably 230 pound guy.

1047
01:16:11.52 --> 01:16:15.88
And he's, so this, this other seal comes up.

1048
01:16:15.88 --> 01:16:18.32
And he's like 180 pound guy.

1049
01:16:18.32 --> 01:16:19.32
He's trained you, too.

1050
01:16:19.32 --> 01:16:20.48
He's got a little bit of a energy.

1051
01:16:20.48 --> 01:16:25.72
He spent a little time, you know, at the Gracie Academy and had, was one of the,

1052
01:16:25.72 --> 01:16:29.52
one of the first guys I knew who was pretty skilled in juditsu.

1053
01:16:29.52 --> 01:16:34.72
And he, he gets this, this, this big guy, you know, the role player's wrestling

1054
01:16:34.72 --> 01:16:37.40
around that gunners made and not cooperating.

1055
01:16:37.40 --> 01:16:38.40
We're wrestling around with him.

1056
01:16:38.40 --> 01:16:42.96
He comes up there, gets a guy, gets a knee on him, goes like knee on stomach.

1057
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:46.20
And the guy, the guy can't do anything.

1058
01:16:46.20 --> 01:16:51.28
And you know, here's this 180 pound guy completely controlling this large guy.

1059
01:16:51.28 --> 01:16:53.64
The two of us couldn't do before.

1060
01:16:53.64 --> 01:16:55.64
And I was like, I need to search for an excuse.

1061
01:16:55.64 --> 01:16:57.16
It's just, it works.

1062
01:16:57.16 --> 01:17:01.08
And it was just a, it was just a, it was just a, a body control, I can control this guy.

1063
01:17:01.08 --> 01:17:04.24
I mean, knee on stomach, get his arms, got him zip tied, done.

1064
01:17:04.24 --> 01:17:08.24
I mean, he's, and he actually, when we debrief with him, you know, he, he comes, now

1065
01:17:08.24 --> 01:17:12.04
it now he's out of his role player, he's like, he's like, hey, that was pretty cool.

1066
01:17:12.04 --> 01:17:15.48
And then I think he actually probably started training some of you, just because he, he,

1067
01:17:15.48 --> 01:17:20.04
he realized like just how effective it was for a guy who really understood body control,

1068
01:17:20.04 --> 01:17:23.44
to be able to just get on the on him, hold him down, you know, and be able to control

1069
01:17:23.44 --> 01:17:25.000
him even though he was half the size of this.

1070
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.56
It interestingly, that's almost, that's why most of us start because it happens to,

1071
01:17:30.56 --> 01:17:34.80
you know, you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that was like, you know, how is this guy?

1072
01:17:34.80 --> 01:17:38.60
Yeah, you know, he looks so much smaller than me and he's just crushing me.

1073
01:17:38.60 --> 01:17:39.32
How's that possible?

1074
01:17:39.32 --> 01:17:40.32
Yeah.

1075
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:44.36
So that was, you know, and that, that case that you just described happened,

1076
01:17:44.36 --> 01:17:49.52
the, you know, every day in the seal team, somebody else that knew some GG2,

1077
01:17:49.52 --> 01:17:56.12
you know, would, would have that scenario happen and eventually the, the, the, the correct

1078
01:17:56.12 --> 01:17:59.36
answer rises up and people say, hey, look, this is working.

1079
01:17:59.36 --> 01:18:00.36
This is not working.

1080
01:18:00.36 --> 01:18:04.76
And so that's how we ended up with, with more of an MMA based approach, because it's

1081
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:08.12
not just pure GG2, it's, it's everything.

1082
01:18:08.12 --> 01:18:09.96
It's moi tie, it's boxing.

1083
01:18:09.96 --> 01:18:14.24
It's, it's, you know, weapons retention pieces to it.

1084
01:18:14.24 --> 01:18:18.28
It's hitting people, learning how to hit people with your gun.

1085
01:18:18.28 --> 01:18:25.96
What we call a muzzle strike, which is, again, this is one of those things where, we kind

1086
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:30.60
of, like, would get be told that the, like, the muzzle strike would, would just kill people.

1087
01:18:30.60 --> 01:18:34.84
Yeah, would kill people or it's going to definitely incapacitate me instantly and knock

1088
01:18:34.84 --> 01:18:35.84
people out.

1089
01:18:35.84 --> 01:18:39.88
And the fact of the matter is, and I know, I know, I know, lay for now, I have seen, I don't

1090
01:18:39.88 --> 01:18:43.56
even know how many people, I've seen muzzle strikes over and over and over again.

1091
01:18:43.56 --> 01:18:47.04
And it just, the, the amount, I don't even think I ever saw an actual knockout.

1092
01:18:47.04 --> 01:18:48.36
I mean, you see some damage.

1093
01:18:48.36 --> 01:18:50.28
It hurts and it cuts the person's face open.

1094
01:18:50.28 --> 01:18:52.56
It makes him bleed everywhere and it's a complete nightmare and you're going to have

1095
01:18:52.56 --> 01:18:55.92
to take him to medical and it's, it's just a bad thing.

1096
01:18:55.92 --> 01:18:59.68
Whereas, somebody that knows a little bit of MMA can go and control these people and take

1097
01:18:59.68 --> 01:19:01.28
them down and it's, it's, it's no factor.

1098
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:06.80
So that's what ended up taking over and it's definitely a good thing and a positive thing

1099
01:19:06.80 --> 01:19:09.72
and it's been, it's been cool to talk to the guys that are now carrying on with the

1100
01:19:09.72 --> 01:19:11.72
program.

1101
01:19:11.72 --> 01:19:16.28
Next question.

1102
01:19:16.28 --> 01:19:24.88
How do you deal with anger and flaired tempers in yourself or your team?

1103
01:19:24.88 --> 01:19:27.48
Maybe if I'm going to go ahead and turn that one over to you.

1104
01:19:27.48 --> 01:19:30.16
I got like experience with that one.

1105
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:32.16
Life's way more experienced than me.

1106
01:19:32.16 --> 01:19:40.16
I've got a lot of experiences this one and I talked about being a direct guy, being a,

1107
01:19:40.16 --> 01:19:44.84
a default aggressive guy and, and that's good.

1108
01:19:44.84 --> 01:19:45.84
There's a lot of good in that.

1109
01:19:45.84 --> 01:19:49.96
There's also some bad when you lose your temper, when you, you know, you lose your cool.

1110
01:19:49.96 --> 01:19:52.52
One, you know, when you get emotional about things and react to stuff, you don't make

1111
01:19:52.52 --> 01:19:53.52
good decisions.

1112
01:19:53.52 --> 01:19:58.24
And so, you know, we always taught our guys that the most important quality they could have

1113
01:19:58.24 --> 01:20:04.000
as a combat leader is to remain calm and make good decisions under chaos and pressure.

1114
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.60
So that doesn't happen when you lose your temper.

1115
01:20:07.60 --> 01:20:13.08
So, you know, when I look back on that, the other thing about it too is when you do lose

1116
01:20:13.08 --> 01:20:17.60
your temper about stuff and it's, I can give you a number of scenarios where it happened

1117
01:20:17.60 --> 01:20:26.24
where, you know, if guys had, people always think like seals are always focused all the

1118
01:20:26.24 --> 01:20:27.24
time.

1119
01:20:27.24 --> 01:20:29.08
You know, and it's life and death for you guys out there.

1120
01:20:29.08 --> 01:20:32.20
When we talk about businesses, they say that all the time, like it's life and death for

1121
01:20:32.20 --> 01:20:33.20
you guys.

1122
01:20:33.20 --> 01:20:35.92
You know, so it's not really life and death for my guys, but how do I get them to say

1123
01:20:35.92 --> 01:20:36.92
focus?

1124
01:20:36.92 --> 01:20:38.92
Guess what?

1125
01:20:38.92 --> 01:20:40.88
People lose discipline, right?

1126
01:20:40.88 --> 01:20:41.88
People lose discipline.

1127
01:20:41.88 --> 01:20:45.08
If there's not leaders that are holding those standards and pushing hard and I remember one

1128
01:20:45.08 --> 01:20:49.84
time in particular, we were a patrolling back to our combat outposts and we've been in a long

1129
01:20:49.84 --> 01:20:50.84
operation.

1130
01:20:50.84 --> 01:20:55.88
It was a phototro in to a dangerous area and we captured a bunch of prisoners and we had

1131
01:20:55.88 --> 01:21:01.16
to walk them back on foot because there were so many IED threats in that area.

1132
01:21:01.16 --> 01:21:04.84
I think we finally met up with some Bradley finding vehicles, a smaller tank from the army

1133
01:21:04.84 --> 01:21:05.84
that came down.

1134
01:21:05.84 --> 01:21:08.72
We loaded them up in that and they took them back from there.

1135
01:21:08.72 --> 01:21:13.28
But so we're walking back a patrolling back and we're almost, you know, we're still

1136
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:17.84
a few hundred yards back away from this combat outpost, but we're an enemy territory.

1137
01:21:17.84 --> 01:21:22.08
And I could see that some of the guys are starting to not be as focused, like looking

1138
01:21:22.08 --> 01:21:27.52
down their weapons and dropping security in those things and I was infuriated by that.

1139
01:21:27.52 --> 01:21:31.72
I was totally infuriated by that and it was because I knew what was at stake that look

1140
01:21:31.72 --> 01:21:36.84
if we're not disciplined all the way back until we're inside that wire of the front

1141
01:21:36.84 --> 01:21:40.28
of the combat outposts, we could take fire at any moment and if we're not watching, you

1142
01:21:40.28 --> 01:21:44.40
know, at that very second we get shot at people might get guilt, you know, it decrees

1143
01:21:44.40 --> 01:21:47.40
our probability of winning that firefight of bringing everybody back.

1144
01:21:47.40 --> 01:21:52.28
So it was a big deal and but I definitely lost my cool when I came back.

1145
01:21:52.28 --> 01:21:57.56
I was chewing it has and like fired up at people and like this is why this is important.

1146
01:21:57.56 --> 01:22:00.76
And I look back on that out of like that's not the best way to do that, right?

1147
01:22:00.76 --> 01:22:07.16
The best way to do that is to say, I mean, four skies to keep security, remind them

1148
01:22:07.16 --> 01:22:11.72
to keep security certainly while it's happening but getting back and saying, guys, here's

1149
01:22:11.72 --> 01:22:13.36
why we got to keep security.

1150
01:22:13.36 --> 01:22:17.32
I know we're only a couple of yards from the combat outposts but recognize their enemy fighters

1151
01:22:17.32 --> 01:22:20.92
out here and they're going to hit us when we least expect it.

1152
01:22:20.92 --> 01:22:24.92
Just because it hasn't happened to us before, even though we've done this does the times,

1153
01:22:24.92 --> 01:22:29.40
does not mean that it won't happen to us the next time and we can't, you know, this is

1154
01:22:29.40 --> 01:22:30.40
important.

1155
01:22:30.40 --> 01:22:33.88
Think about how you would feel if somebody got killed when you were supposed to be home

1156
01:22:33.88 --> 01:22:36.72
security as they were crossing the street and you weren't paying attention.

1157
01:22:36.72 --> 01:22:38.28
You know, it's an interesting use that example.

1158
01:22:38.28 --> 01:22:42.96
I almost feel that you showing legit anger at that point as a positive thing.

1159
01:22:42.96 --> 01:22:47.48
Like you want to make it perfectly clear to everybody and the way you get their attention

1160
01:22:47.48 --> 01:22:52.48
because it's not like you lose your temper all the time is by, you know, getting angry

1161
01:22:52.48 --> 01:22:56.80
and people go, oh, you know, he's, he doesn't lose the temper very often.

1162
01:22:56.80 --> 01:22:58.28
Here he is super fired up.

1163
01:22:58.28 --> 01:22:59.28
Well, I don't think it's tension.

1164
01:22:59.28 --> 01:23:00.28
I don't think it's a problem.

1165
01:23:00.28 --> 01:23:01.52
It's not a problem to get angry.

1166
01:23:01.52 --> 01:23:03.28
I got really, really angry.

1167
01:23:03.28 --> 01:23:04.28
Okay.

1168
01:23:04.28 --> 01:23:09.28
So, it's one of those things where it would have been more effective for me to be stern

1169
01:23:09.28 --> 01:23:14.60
and not back down from that in the least and not treat it lightly in the lead.

1170
01:23:14.60 --> 01:23:18.80
I'm not saying that at all, but I think just to loot to yell and scream and those things,

1171
01:23:18.80 --> 01:23:20.44
it's just never the best way to get right across.

1172
01:23:20.44 --> 01:23:21.44
You're right.

1173
01:23:21.44 --> 01:23:22.44
That is true.

1174
01:23:22.44 --> 01:23:26.20
If you completely lose in your yelling and scream in, it's, it's not a good thing.

1175
01:23:26.20 --> 01:23:30.16
Even though you're absolutely right, it was important and I wanted that address.

1176
01:23:30.16 --> 01:23:33.04
It was like, it just wasn't the best way to do that.

1177
01:23:33.04 --> 01:23:34.28
Looking back on that out.

1178
01:23:34.28 --> 01:23:40.44
One time in particular too was, I can think when you wanted to make some changes to our

1179
01:23:40.44 --> 01:23:41.44
operation.

1180
01:23:41.44 --> 01:23:42.84
Oh yeah, that's right.

1181
01:23:42.84 --> 01:23:43.84
That's right.

1182
01:23:43.84 --> 01:23:49.48
I get really tired about the last podcast or not, but I was ready to cancel the

1183
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:50.48
op.

1184
01:23:50.48 --> 01:23:53.80
Jockel came in and was like, what about this?

1185
01:23:53.80 --> 01:23:56.08
You know, maybe, do we look at it from this direction?

1186
01:23:56.08 --> 01:24:00.28
Why don't you guys maybe patrolling on this route and not go across this bridge where

1187
01:24:00.28 --> 01:24:04.56
there's a choke point and they might bury ideas in the road and I was like, we've been

1188
01:24:04.56 --> 01:24:05.56
looking this for hours.

1189
01:24:05.56 --> 01:24:07.96
It's like, now he's changing it to the minute it's prior.

1190
01:24:07.96 --> 01:24:14.52
Like, cancel the, and Jockel, he could have lost his cool with me because I just lost

1191
01:24:14.52 --> 01:24:15.52
my cool.

1192
01:24:15.52 --> 01:24:18.28
And you know, I've been, I've been, I've been hours at this and I was frustrated.

1193
01:24:18.28 --> 01:24:22.76
I was ready to get to get this op launch and all the paperwork requirements and the levels

1194
01:24:22.76 --> 01:24:28.48
of approvals that we need and running around trying to fix all these things and he actually

1195
01:24:28.48 --> 01:24:30.24
just looked at me and was like,

1196
01:24:30.24 --> 01:24:32.04
we don't need a cancel the op.

1197
01:24:32.04 --> 01:24:32.72
It's fine.

1198
01:24:32.72 --> 01:24:34.72
It's going to be fine.

1199
01:24:34.72 --> 01:24:38.32
And then you actually get asked me some questions like, is what, does what I'm saying

1200
01:24:38.32 --> 01:24:39.32
make sense?

1201
01:24:39.32 --> 01:24:40.72
And I wanted to be like, no.

1202
01:24:40.72 --> 01:24:45.72
I can't, you know, but it was like, yes, I, I totally, totally make sense.

1203
01:24:45.72 --> 01:24:46.72
Yeah, totally make sense.

1204
01:24:46.72 --> 01:24:48.60
You're like, okay, how long is it going to take to change it?

1205
01:24:48.60 --> 01:24:50.76
You're like, I was like two minutes.

1206
01:24:50.76 --> 01:24:52.000
Like, what we have eight minutes off.

1207
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
So no problem.

1208
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Let's get it done.

1209
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.72
We don't need to cancel the operation.

1210
01:24:55.72 --> 01:24:57.56
I was like, no, we don't.

1211
01:24:57.56 --> 01:24:58.56
Yeah.

1212
01:24:58.56 --> 01:24:59.56
Yeah.

1213
01:24:59.56 --> 01:25:08.32
And like you said, it's important to maintain your, your cool and the way I do that

1214
01:25:08.32 --> 01:25:11.08
is by being detached, talking about it all the time.

1215
01:25:11.08 --> 01:25:12.08
And that's the two ways.

1216
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:16.36
When you got all fired up at me, I was like, like, okay, you know, like,

1217
01:25:16.36 --> 01:25:17.36
life's getting fired up.

1218
01:25:17.36 --> 01:25:22.12
And I didn't think, life's getting fired up because he's immature or because he's,

1219
01:25:22.12 --> 01:25:23.32
doesn't can't control himself.

1220
01:25:23.32 --> 01:25:24.56
I thought to myself, hey, you know what?

1221
01:25:24.56 --> 01:25:26.32
He's been working on this all day.

1222
01:25:26.32 --> 01:25:28.36
He's got a lot of pressure on him.

1223
01:25:28.36 --> 01:25:32.16
There's a lot of frustration when you're doing these plans and doing all this paperwork.

1224
01:25:32.16 --> 01:25:33.96
I understand where he's coming from.

1225
01:25:33.96 --> 01:25:37.52
Let me give him some space, let him vent a little bit, and then let's re-approach this thing.

1226
01:25:37.52 --> 01:25:39.28
That's how I'm coming at the situation.

1227
01:25:39.28 --> 01:25:43.60
So how you handle it, though, is perfect because at you blown back up and it was just

1228
01:25:43.60 --> 01:25:44.60
worse.

1229
01:25:44.60 --> 01:25:45.60
So natural human reaction was right.

1230
01:25:45.60 --> 01:25:46.60
Then I get mad.

1231
01:25:46.60 --> 01:25:50.04
We're yelling each, even though we have a, we're a minister, cross relationship.

1232
01:25:50.04 --> 01:25:51.04
We would have canceled the job.

1233
01:25:51.04 --> 01:25:52.64
Yeah, it would have been a big deal.

1234
01:25:52.64 --> 01:25:57.04
Or even if even if you end up saying, like, you know, as so many leaders would do, like,

1235
01:25:57.04 --> 01:25:58.36
you're going to do it this way.

1236
01:25:58.36 --> 01:26:01.000
And then I, I'm mad at you and I'm all pissed off.

1237
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.84
You, you know, you came in and Trump me.

1238
01:26:02.84 --> 01:26:05.60
Oh, yeah, by the way, what happens when something goes wrong on the operation?

1239
01:26:05.60 --> 01:26:07.000
And I'm like, joc-o-tool.

1240
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
You just do this.

1241
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.28
And then then you have the frictions, but the, the best thing that you did in that situation

1242
01:26:13.28 --> 01:26:15.40
was you actually just smiled and laughed at him.

1243
01:26:15.40 --> 01:26:16.40
Like, just take it.

1244
01:26:16.40 --> 01:26:17.40
Well, I didn't like that.

1245
01:26:17.40 --> 01:26:20.08
I think I just, just to make that clear, I didn't laugh at him.

1246
01:26:20.08 --> 01:26:23.16
Like, he was a little, like, hey, man.

1247
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:24.48
You know what he knows me?

1248
01:26:24.48 --> 01:26:26.000
And he knows exactly where I was coming from.

1249
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.40
Like, hey, I know it's, I know what's going on.

1250
01:26:28.40 --> 01:26:33.20
It was the perfect way to deescalate the situation, which made me deescalate exactly.

1251
01:26:33.20 --> 01:26:35.40
And made me realize like, yeah, it makes total sense.

1252
01:26:35.40 --> 01:26:36.92
And then we execute it was no problem.

1253
01:26:36.92 --> 01:26:38.40
Yeah.

1254
01:26:38.40 --> 01:26:39.24
That's how you deal with.

1255
01:26:39.24 --> 01:26:40.48
That's how you deal with.

1256
01:26:40.48 --> 01:26:45.28
So when someone gets mad at you, deescalate when you feel yourself getting spun up,

1257
01:26:45.28 --> 01:26:46.12
detach.

1258
01:26:46.12 --> 01:26:49.68
When have you got spun up and lost your cool?

1259
01:26:49.68 --> 01:26:52.68
I've said this before on the podcast.

1260
01:26:52.68 --> 01:26:56.60
I've said it's a lot of different printers and copy machines.

1261
01:26:56.60 --> 01:26:57.60
They don't like me.

1262
01:26:57.60 --> 01:27:00.000
They don't like them.

1263
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.16
And so we talk in straight up office space, the office space style.

1264
01:27:03.16 --> 01:27:05.96
I don't like, I don't like printers and copy machines.

1265
01:27:05.96 --> 01:27:08.04
They don't ever do what I want them to do.

1266
01:27:08.04 --> 01:27:09.60
And so I get angry at them.

1267
01:27:09.60 --> 01:27:12.16
So I lose my mind a little bit.

1268
01:27:12.16 --> 01:27:14.36
But no, I don't lose my temper very often.

1269
01:27:14.36 --> 01:27:16.28
It doesn't do me a lot of good.

1270
01:27:16.28 --> 01:27:20.44
And usually, it usually doesn't help the situation.

1271
01:27:20.44 --> 01:27:22.56
It doesn't help you solve the problem.

1272
01:27:22.56 --> 01:27:26.000
And my mind is always on, how do I get this thing solved?

1273
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.08
They never help you solve the problem.

1274
01:27:27.08 --> 01:27:28.08
That's for sure.

1275
01:27:28.08 --> 01:27:31.64
So if you're like me and you lose your cool, you've got to practice it.

1276
01:27:31.64 --> 01:27:32.64
You've got to rehearse that.

1277
01:27:32.64 --> 01:27:37.24
You've got to make sure that you're detaching and not losing your cool so that you can get

1278
01:27:37.24 --> 01:27:38.84
the job done and win.

1279
01:27:38.84 --> 01:27:40.12
That's what it's all about.

1280
01:27:40.12 --> 01:27:45.36
And the Delta Ptoon Commander, he would go in a little bit of rage from time to time.

1281
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:51.16
And one day, the Delta Ptoon Commander is going to be out of the military and he's

1282
01:27:51.16 --> 01:27:54.56
coming right on this podcast and he knows that he's fired up.

1283
01:27:54.56 --> 01:27:58.96
But he's my other brother.

1284
01:27:58.96 --> 01:28:00.32
And that's going to be a good time.

1285
01:28:00.32 --> 01:28:03.68
But he would get some rage going.

1286
01:28:03.68 --> 01:28:09.68
And I'd have to back him down a little bit and say, bro, let's me.

1287
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:12.56
And it'll raise to get fired up right out.

1288
01:28:12.56 --> 01:28:16.24
And we're here to win and I'm here to help you.

1289
01:28:16.24 --> 01:28:19.56
And he'd go, I know, but damn.

1290
01:28:19.56 --> 01:28:21.56
Awesome.

1291
01:28:21.56 --> 01:28:24.04
All right.

1292
01:28:24.04 --> 01:28:29.92
Next one, and this is a pretty heavy subject, actually.

1293
01:28:29.92 --> 01:28:34.12
Jocconwave, thoughts on cops being ambushed.

1294
01:28:34.12 --> 01:28:40.16
What should police departments do be doing to prepare, especially with no command support

1295
01:28:40.16 --> 01:28:42.48
for training?

1296
01:28:42.48 --> 01:28:47.92
The crisis is an American law enforcement role in battling this terrorism.

1297
01:28:47.92 --> 01:28:49.52
We have been training active shooter lots.

1298
01:28:49.52 --> 01:28:52.28
These are, this is actually a conglomeration of a few questions.

1299
01:28:52.28 --> 01:28:57.76
But the basic question is thoughts on the cops being ambushed.

1300
01:28:57.76 --> 01:29:02.40
What should police departments be doing to train for that prepare for it?

1301
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:06.000
And then how do civilians fended at that picture?

1302
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.36
And what can civilians do to help?

1303
01:29:10.36 --> 01:29:14.28
If the horrible shooting that took place in Texas.

1304
01:29:14.28 --> 01:29:16.28
Terrific stuff.

1305
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:22.64
And certainly we lift up families of those laws and our prayers and the entire police force

1306
01:29:22.64 --> 01:29:29.80
there in Dallas, in Baton Rouge, and across the country where they've lost their brothers.

1307
01:29:29.80 --> 01:29:35.72
I think, first of all, we have tremendous respect for law enforcement for the boys and

1308
01:29:35.72 --> 01:29:41.84
the police, police departments, sheriff's deputies, federal law enforcement.

1309
01:29:41.84 --> 01:29:43.40
They protect the home front.

1310
01:29:43.40 --> 01:29:44.40
And we have to have that.

1311
01:29:44.40 --> 01:29:45.52
We have to have that.

1312
01:29:45.52 --> 01:29:48.28
We have to have, we have to be a nation of laws.

1313
01:29:48.28 --> 01:29:51.48
And without that, we've got complete lawlessness.

1314
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:59.80
And so I think America needs to show appreciation for their police departments and for

1315
01:29:59.80 --> 01:30:01.96
their law enforcement officers.

1316
01:30:01.96 --> 01:30:03.12
We can't do that enough.

1317
01:30:03.12 --> 01:30:04.36
We gotta think those folks.

1318
01:30:04.36 --> 01:30:09.84
I think as far as, this is just another example.

1319
01:30:09.84 --> 01:30:13.68
When you're talking about the police ambush, this is another example that just as we talked

1320
01:30:13.68 --> 01:30:17.56
about that first question, darkness, the evil that's in the world.

1321
01:30:17.56 --> 01:30:20.36
There are some evil people that celebrate this evil.

1322
01:30:20.36 --> 01:30:22.52
Like it's a great thing.

1323
01:30:22.52 --> 01:30:29.56
And I think there's just no justification for the kind of horrific stuff that we've seen.

1324
01:30:29.56 --> 01:30:32.40
These ambushes on police officers.

1325
01:30:32.40 --> 01:30:37.88
So I think police need to start, you're already seeing the yard, you see a police police

1326
01:30:37.88 --> 01:30:40.000
that are getting, they're getting long guns.

1327
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.80
For the forces that didn't have them a lot of them, but maybe they didn't have access to

1328
01:30:42.80 --> 01:30:44.84
them or couldn't get to them quickly.

1329
01:30:44.84 --> 01:30:46.16
They're going to need to have those long guns.

1330
01:30:46.16 --> 01:30:50.88
Where if someone's targeting you with a rifle and all you have is a pistol, it's not good

1331
01:30:50.88 --> 01:30:51.88
for you.

1332
01:30:51.88 --> 01:30:52.88
That's interesting.

1333
01:30:52.88 --> 01:30:55.68
For those of you that don't know anything about guns like Echo, the difference between

1334
01:30:55.68 --> 01:31:00.56
you having a rifle and a pistol is night and day.

1335
01:31:00.56 --> 01:31:03.84
I mean, let's just break it down a pistol.

1336
01:31:03.84 --> 01:31:07.84
If you're a good shot with a pistol, maybe if you're a great shot with a pistol, maybe

1337
01:31:07.84 --> 01:31:11.32
you're getting out what 50 yards.

1338
01:31:11.32 --> 01:31:15.76
You're a good shot with a rifle and you're out to 800 yards.

1339
01:31:15.76 --> 01:31:17.12
Pretty easily.

1340
01:31:17.12 --> 01:31:22.24
Now on top of that, you've got a pistol, you can a pistol round will stop when it hits

1341
01:31:22.24 --> 01:31:27.60
something, you know, sometimes pistol round stop when they hit regular windows on cars.

1342
01:31:27.60 --> 01:31:31.92
A high power rifle is going to rip through the doors of cars, no problem.

1343
01:31:31.92 --> 01:31:32.92
It's going to be.

1344
01:31:32.92 --> 01:31:38.000
There is a massive, massive difference between being out in the street with a pistol and

1345
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.12
being out in the street with a rifle.

1346
01:31:41.12 --> 01:31:45.12
Luckily, they're, well, not luckily, but they are starting to arm the police for these

1347
01:31:45.12 --> 01:31:47.24
scenarios that you're going to get in.

1348
01:31:47.24 --> 01:31:54.88
I remember the first time, first patrol I went on in Iraq, in Humvees, and we hit, we

1349
01:31:54.88 --> 01:31:58.76
hit a steel hedgehog, right?

1350
01:31:58.76 --> 01:32:01.88
The little obstacles that Americans put out, I don't know if they left them there, I've

1351
01:32:01.88 --> 01:32:02.88
been from some problem.

1352
01:32:02.88 --> 01:32:05.92
So I'm driving along all of a sudden boom, we hit one, it was my vehicle.

1353
01:32:05.92 --> 01:32:08.76
I thought to myself, I just hit an idea about the die.

1354
01:32:08.76 --> 01:32:13.72
But our vehicle gets jacked up, we're like, propped up and everyone poured out in the street

1355
01:32:13.72 --> 01:32:15.08
and took up security.

1356
01:32:15.08 --> 01:32:18.56
But everyone's out there with a little M4s.

1357
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:22.20
And you feel, even, you know, because we want to machine guns.

1358
01:32:22.20 --> 01:32:27.24
We never went out again without, you know, to heavy machine guns per Humvee, because

1359
01:32:27.24 --> 01:32:30.72
we wanted to be ready to rock and roll.

1360
01:32:30.72 --> 01:32:34.08
So that's the same feeling you're going to get rolling out with just a pistol.

1361
01:32:34.08 --> 01:32:35.08
So that's number one.

1362
01:32:35.08 --> 01:32:42.08
Number two, the police departments, they got to start looking at tactics, at urban combat

1363
01:32:42.08 --> 01:32:47.40
tactics and how to handle these situations, how to cover and move primarily, how to cover

1364
01:32:47.40 --> 01:32:48.64
and move.

1365
01:32:48.64 --> 01:32:56.08
It always is shocking to me when I see people not using these cover.

1366
01:32:56.08 --> 01:33:01.52
When there's gun fight or potential gun fight or even if there's not, that's one thing

1367
01:33:01.52 --> 01:33:04.000
in Ramadi like when you're walking down the street in Ramadi, you don't walk down street,

1368
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.56
you're moving from cover to cover.

1369
01:33:05.56 --> 01:33:08.52
And if you're a police officer, let's at least be near cover.

1370
01:33:08.52 --> 01:33:11.04
So if shooting starts, you can get in cover.

1371
01:33:11.04 --> 01:33:16.08
When I see a rest happening, actual rest happening, they're trying to get someone to stop

1372
01:33:16.08 --> 01:33:20.88
and the police officers are standing out in the open to try and tell someone to stop.

1373
01:33:20.88 --> 01:33:23.24
Don't stand out in the open, stand behind cover.

1374
01:33:23.24 --> 01:33:28.44
Now there's a complexity there because you want the person that you're trying to stop

1375
01:33:28.44 --> 01:33:31.44
to be able to clearly identify that you're a police officer, right?

1376
01:33:31.44 --> 01:33:35.84
But let's make the error on the side of being behind cover.

1377
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:40.16
So if that person does draw gun, you can be able to react them from a place to cover.

1378
01:33:40.16 --> 01:33:44.48
Because if you're the difference between standing behind cover and standing out in the open,

1379
01:33:44.48 --> 01:33:47.60
if someone starts shooting at you, oh, if you've got cover, you're good to go.

1380
01:33:47.60 --> 01:33:48.80
That's literally you're good to go.

1381
01:33:48.80 --> 01:33:52.72
They have to do, they have to hit a tiny, tiny little target of whatever's exposed to,

1382
01:33:52.72 --> 01:33:54.32
you know, part of your head.

1383
01:33:54.32 --> 01:33:57.12
Whereas if you're standing in the open, they're gonna hit you.

1384
01:33:57.12 --> 01:34:03.68
So I think those tactics need to start looking at the individual tactics of doing a rest.

1385
01:34:03.68 --> 01:34:08.56
And then they need to start looking at the larger group tactics when you have either one,

1386
01:34:08.56 --> 01:34:11.68
you know, you got your partner out there, how do you operate together, how do you cover,

1387
01:34:11.68 --> 01:34:15.04
move together, what's the best way to react to these scenarios?

1388
01:34:15.04 --> 01:34:20.24
And then furthermore, when another group, when other police show up,

1389
01:34:20.24 --> 01:34:24.48
how do you then quickly organize into elements that can operate together,

1390
01:34:24.48 --> 01:34:27.92
like a military unit, and I know that's gonna make some people scared.

1391
01:34:27.92 --> 01:34:30.32
But like that's that they shouldn't be scared of that.

1392
01:34:30.32 --> 01:34:33.52
When you're in a gunfight, you need to use tactics,

1393
01:34:33.52 --> 01:34:36.000
gunfighting tactics, and those come from the military.

1394
01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.52
So they should be able to operate in pairs, they should be able to operate in elements,

1395
01:34:39.52 --> 01:34:42.88
and grow into you get to a point where you can handle these situations.

1396
01:34:43.60 --> 01:34:47.68
And that's gonna take a lot of training, and that's gonna take money,

1397
01:34:47.68 --> 01:34:51.04
and that's gonna cost, and I was talking to some of my friends and our police officers.

1398
01:34:51.04 --> 01:34:55.36
And I'm not a fact one guy just met really, really good guy, really fired up,

1399
01:34:55.36 --> 01:34:56.88
due to a two-player, of course.

1400
01:34:56.88 --> 01:35:02.000
And he said the amount of training that they get is very, very minimal.

1401
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.52
So for example, a regular police officer, they actually don't,

1402
01:35:07.52 --> 01:35:11.28
oftentimes they don't have designated times for training.

1403
01:35:11.28 --> 01:35:15.20
They don't have times to say, okay, you're gonna work 40 hours this week,

1404
01:35:16.24 --> 01:35:21.28
four of those hours are going to be training, and that's completely wrong.

1405
01:35:21.92 --> 01:35:27.20
You should have mandatory real good training,

1406
01:35:27.20 --> 01:35:31.52
four-soned force training, and that's what Lave talked about earlier, where you're shooting live,

1407
01:35:31.52 --> 01:35:34.08
or simulation rounds, or paint ball rounds to each other.

1408
01:35:34.08 --> 01:35:36.64
So you're getting used to those stressful situations.

1409
01:35:36.64 --> 01:35:40.88
So because I'll tell you what, you square off of the guy, you square off of the guy one time,

1410
01:35:40.88 --> 01:35:43.76
and he's got simulation, and you stand out in the open, and don't get covered,

1411
01:35:43.76 --> 01:35:47.04
and he pulls out that gun and shoot you three times in the face with the simulation.

1412
01:35:47.04 --> 01:35:49.68
And then the next time you go again, you're gonna be having some cover.

1413
01:35:49.68 --> 01:35:50.72
It's gonna happen.

1414
01:35:50.72 --> 01:35:53.04
And so, and that's what we want people to do.

1415
01:35:53.04 --> 01:35:55.28
You know what's interesting about that is, you know,

1416
01:35:55.28 --> 01:36:00.56
we, there was a real emphasis on Lave fire when I first came into the seal teams,

1417
01:36:00.56 --> 01:36:04.24
and a lot of the instructors that were putting us through training had not had any real experience.

1418
01:36:04.24 --> 01:36:06.80
I didn't even real combat experience.

1419
01:36:06.80 --> 01:36:09.20
And so, we still had those folks that were saying,

1420
01:36:09.20 --> 01:36:12.64
well, we're gonna focus on Lave fire, because that's more important, and that's better training.

1421
01:36:12.64 --> 01:36:14.32
And the reality is, it's not.

1422
01:36:14.32 --> 01:36:17.28
It's actually worse training, because you're dealing with paper targets.

1423
01:36:17.28 --> 01:36:18.64
And it's simple.

1424
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:21.76
It's like, either there are, there's a weapon in their hand, or there are not.

1425
01:36:21.76 --> 01:36:24.16
Shoot them, don't shoot them, did you hit the target, did you not?

1426
01:36:24.16 --> 01:36:28.80
So, while it's important to be able to operate with Lave fire, and that's great,

1427
01:36:28.80 --> 01:36:31.04
so much better to operate against a role player.

1428
01:36:31.04 --> 01:36:33.44
Now you go into a room, you're like, the guy's moving.

1429
01:36:33.44 --> 01:36:36.96
You can't see, you know, he's shooting, he's not shooting it.

1430
01:36:36.96 --> 01:36:44.56
Maybe he is alarmed, but if he's bum rushing you, and for us, if a guy's yelling a

1431
01:36:44.56 --> 01:36:49.44
lock bar and running at you, he's probably a high suicide bomber threat.

1432
01:36:49.44 --> 01:36:51.84
So he's getting smoke, so he's getting smoke too.

1433
01:36:51.84 --> 01:36:58.24
So, I think police forces have absolutely got to make time for training, but they got to put

1434
01:36:58.24 --> 01:36:59.84
those realistic scenarios in there too.

1435
01:36:59.84 --> 01:37:03.92
And, you know, our police officers are in, and as Jaco said, we've got many, many friends

1436
01:37:03.92 --> 01:37:08.24
are in law enforcement, some of them form a seal that we work with, they've gone that

1437
01:37:08.24 --> 01:37:09.24
round now.

1438
01:37:09.24 --> 01:37:12.16
And they're in very difficult scenarios all the time.

1439
01:37:12.16 --> 01:37:16.40
It's one of the hard things about a close-quarters combat is, our instructor's always

1440
01:37:16.40 --> 01:37:18.88
tells us, like, don't game it, don't game it, meaning.

1441
01:37:18.88 --> 01:37:23.60
And I talked about with a killhouse, how you can change the walls and maneuver around.

1442
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:29.52
When you're thinking in your mind, I know what I'm going to see when I enter this room.

1443
01:37:29.52 --> 01:37:31.60
That's what you generally see.

1444
01:37:31.60 --> 01:37:33.60
And so, it's a difficult thing.

1445
01:37:33.60 --> 01:37:36.64
You've got to make it easy to get really amped up.

1446
01:37:36.64 --> 01:37:39.84
Your heart rates going and you're like, like, you know, you know, because there's pressure on

1447
01:37:39.84 --> 01:37:42.88
you got instructors there and you want to make sure you make your shots and make good decisions.

1448
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:45.76
And particularly as a new guy, when you have a done that before and you're going to over the

1449
01:37:45.76 --> 01:37:47.08
first time.

1450
01:37:47.08 --> 01:37:52.48
And so, if you're game in it and you're already envisioning what you're going to see,

1451
01:37:52.48 --> 01:37:53.48
that's how you react to it.

1452
01:37:53.48 --> 01:37:59.08
And I remember I shot a target and the stars are like, bad, look at that target.

1453
01:37:59.08 --> 01:38:01.92
There's no, it's, there's nothing in the guy's hand.

1454
01:38:01.92 --> 01:38:07.24
There's no, I, I, I thought I saw a weapon in the target and I saw a hammer the target,

1455
01:38:07.24 --> 01:38:08.88
you know, with rounds.

1456
01:38:08.88 --> 01:38:13.80
And I'm looking at the holes in the, you know, the chest, the vaporized hotel.

1457
01:38:13.80 --> 01:38:15.04
Did you engage hostels?

1458
01:38:15.04 --> 01:38:16.44
I vaporized hostels.

1459
01:38:16.44 --> 01:38:19.000
I think we'll have to move in Navy SEALs.

1460
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
But that's, that kind of thing can really get to you.

1461
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.08
So, and only, you only learn that when you, you only realize how easily that can happen,

1462
01:38:27.08 --> 01:38:31.000
when it happens to you in training and when they change those things around so that you go

1463
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
in there and it's a, the hallways different and you're moving a different direction and

1464
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.16
the, there's, you know, it causes those kinds of issues.

1465
01:38:37.16 --> 01:38:43.60
So, what, what you're talking about is you want to train for the unexpected.

1466
01:38:43.60 --> 01:38:44.84
That's what you want to have happen.

1467
01:38:44.84 --> 01:38:49.04
And the things that you see in combat are crazy, the things that cops deal with, go watch

1468
01:38:49.04 --> 01:38:50.04
YouTube.

1469
01:38:50.04 --> 01:38:53.56
I said this last time we talked about this subject, go watch YouTube and watch see the crazy

1470
01:38:53.56 --> 01:38:56.32
things that people do out in the world.

1471
01:38:56.32 --> 01:38:58.76
And you got to be prepared for all those things and how do you prepare?

1472
01:38:58.76 --> 01:39:01.08
You got to learn to think, you got to learn to think quickly.

1473
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:07.72
I was talking to one of our guys from Task Media Brewster the other day and it's, I'm

1474
01:39:07.72 --> 01:39:12.92
not going to say his name obviously, but he's one of one of my favorite guys who did that

1475
01:39:12.92 --> 01:39:16.92
deployment with us came back and I think it was either his next deployment of the deployment

1476
01:39:16.92 --> 01:39:23.12
after went to Afghanistan and did a lot of incredible stuff in Afghanistan and again,

1477
01:39:23.12 --> 01:39:24.92
I put him through training for that.

1478
01:39:24.92 --> 01:39:31.48
So I was running training and he was just a great guy stepped up and I said, hey man,

1479
01:39:31.48 --> 01:39:32.92
what was the, because I didn't fight in Afghanistan.

1480
01:39:32.92 --> 01:39:36.96
I said, what was, what was the difference between what, you know, you're deployment to Afghanistan

1481
01:39:36.96 --> 01:39:40.08
where you got a bunch of gun fights and got after it compared to what it was like in

1482
01:39:40.08 --> 01:39:41.08
Romadi.

1483
01:39:41.08 --> 01:39:47.48
And he said, you know, the biggest difference was in Afghanistan when things are happening,

1484
01:39:47.48 --> 01:39:50.36
they're, they're usually at a distance.

1485
01:39:50.36 --> 01:39:54.36
You know, you're in, you're looking at across a valley, you're looking down a ridge line,

1486
01:39:54.36 --> 01:39:58.16
you're looking, you know, you're, you can observe and you can got some time to think

1487
01:39:58.16 --> 01:40:00.80
and you can get some cover and think, okay, I think this is where they are.

1488
01:40:00.80 --> 01:40:01.80
Let me take another look.

1489
01:40:01.80 --> 01:40:02.64
You can pop your head out.

1490
01:40:02.64 --> 01:40:09.64
You can assess and he just looked at me and he said, in Romadi, you had to make a decision.

1491
01:40:09.64 --> 01:40:15.40
Now, and I started laughing because that, you know, you don't, there's no distance.

1492
01:40:15.40 --> 01:40:16.88
The person is across the street.

1493
01:40:16.88 --> 01:40:21.96
The person is two buildings away and you as a leader or even not as a leader, as a shooter.

1494
01:40:21.96 --> 01:40:22.96
You got to make a decision right now.

1495
01:40:22.96 --> 01:40:25.000
As a matter of fact, the leader's not going to tell you what to do.

1496
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.40
You can engage across the street.

1497
01:40:26.40 --> 01:40:28.48
You're, you're not going to wait for the leader to tell you what to do.

1498
01:40:28.48 --> 01:40:29.48
You got to know what to do.

1499
01:40:29.48 --> 01:40:35.16
You got to act and, and that intensity of urban combat combat and again, this is like

1500
01:40:35.16 --> 01:40:39.12
when we talk about the Cheshire war and what those guys, that's what was so stressful and

1501
01:40:39.12 --> 01:40:42.60
those lessons learned, what they said, hey, and the urban combat environment, these guys need

1502
01:40:42.60 --> 01:40:47.04
to be cycled out of the urban combat environment because the ID threat, because the sniper threat,

1503
01:40:47.04 --> 01:40:50.28
because the immense pressure of having to make decisions now, they should be cycled out like

1504
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:53.56
I think it was at the two months and here we were, I'm putting you guys out in the field

1505
01:40:53.56 --> 01:40:58.24
for six straight months and two in urban combat, apologize, life, apologize, I love you.

1506
01:40:58.24 --> 01:41:00.36
Bruges are guys damn hard.

1507
01:41:00.36 --> 01:41:01.36
We loved it.

1508
01:41:01.36 --> 01:41:06.000
But so, so that, and that's go back and that's what these cops are dealing with.

1509
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.44
That's these police officers dealing with is they got to get practice and rehearse,

1510
01:41:10.44 --> 01:41:13.72
making these decisions now because that's what they have to do.

1511
01:41:13.72 --> 01:41:18.12
So now what can you do to buy yourself an extra quarter second and extra half a second?

1512
01:41:18.12 --> 01:41:21.96
Well, don't stand out in the open, create some distance, why are you approaching the person

1513
01:41:21.96 --> 01:41:22.96
to ask yourself why?

1514
01:41:22.96 --> 01:41:24.28
Well, I mean, if, where's this guy?

1515
01:41:24.28 --> 01:41:26.28
He's going to run for me if he's runs or what's going to happen?

1516
01:41:26.28 --> 01:41:30.12
Is he going to come over threat, less of a threat, so you can, you can make those decisions.

1517
01:41:30.12 --> 01:41:36.000
Another piece of this, citizens of America.

1518
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.04
I think we actually need to teach in high school, in ninth grade freshman classes, I think

1519
01:41:41.04 --> 01:41:46.92
there needs to be a class called how to get arrested by the police and they tell you

1520
01:41:46.92 --> 01:41:51.88
what you should do when you get pulled over by the police or you get told to get down by

1521
01:41:51.88 --> 01:41:54.80
the police or you get told to get away from the wall by the police.

1522
01:41:54.80 --> 01:41:56.24
You know what you do?

1523
01:41:56.24 --> 01:41:57.56
You do it.

1524
01:41:57.56 --> 01:41:58.56
You do it.

1525
01:41:58.56 --> 01:41:59.56
That's what you do.

1526
01:41:59.56 --> 01:42:00.72
You show them your hands.

1527
01:42:00.72 --> 01:42:04.36
You get your hands out of your pockets, you put your hands in the air and you know what?

1528
01:42:04.36 --> 01:42:09.32
Part of that class should be is the students that are going through the class get to be

1529
01:42:09.32 --> 01:42:15.56
the cop and get to use simulation, get to feel what it's like to know, to not know,

1530
01:42:15.56 --> 01:42:16.56
actually.

1531
01:42:16.56 --> 01:42:20.92
So when you pull this guy over, is he, what's he going to do to you?

1532
01:42:20.92 --> 01:42:23.24
And I watched a video the other day that did a great job.

1533
01:42:23.24 --> 01:42:25.96
Somebody suckered me in on the internet on YouTube.

1534
01:42:25.96 --> 01:42:30.56
It was, um, watch another horrible police brutality.

1535
01:42:30.56 --> 01:42:32.80
He's like some kind of title like that.

1536
01:42:32.80 --> 01:42:36.56
And I'm watching it and this guy, that's in the car.

1537
01:42:36.56 --> 01:42:41.76
So it's a traffic stop and the guy that's in the cars is being totally compliant.

1538
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:44.88
And I'm like, oh, God, I can't believe this cop is going to do anything to this guy.

1539
01:42:44.88 --> 01:42:47.64
Look at this guy. He's getting his license like he was asked to.

1540
01:42:47.64 --> 01:42:50.48
I'm like, I could barely watch because it's like another shooting.

1541
01:42:50.48 --> 01:42:51.28
That was the title.

1542
01:42:51.28 --> 01:42:52.76
Another shooting, another death.

1543
01:42:53.76 --> 01:42:56.44
And because I always think those things are horrible to watch.

1544
01:42:56.44 --> 01:43:00.60
So watch it away for this cop just to pull out his gun or see a quick movement and

1545
01:43:00.60 --> 01:43:01.88
pull out his gun and shoot the guy.

1546
01:43:01.88 --> 01:43:07.20
And the guy's just being compliant and nice and reaches in to grab something,

1547
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:10.76
grab his wallet or whatever pulls out a gun and shoots it, got shots, the cop,

1548
01:43:10.76 --> 01:43:12.84
got shoots, the cop, us out of car runs.

1549
01:43:12.84 --> 01:43:15.08
Totally caught me by surprise.

1550
01:43:15.08 --> 01:43:24.92
So when you are getting arrested and we need to educate the citizens of America on how to get arrested.

1551
01:43:24.92 --> 01:43:27.72
And I think that would be very helpful.

1552
01:43:27.72 --> 01:43:34.88
Instead of protesting the cops for shooting people, they should say, okay, what can we do?

1553
01:43:34.88 --> 01:43:36.20
Which takes ownership of this?

1554
01:43:36.20 --> 01:43:40.24
What can we do is citizens to do a better job of getting arrested?

1555
01:43:40.24 --> 01:43:43.68
You know, be compliant, show your hands.

1556
01:43:43.68 --> 01:43:49.24
That is, and again, I think it's important to understand the pressure that police are

1557
01:43:49.24 --> 01:43:50.24
under.

1558
01:43:50.24 --> 01:43:56.32
And hey, just so everybody knows some of those videos that I watch, I know for it's horrible

1559
01:43:56.32 --> 01:44:01.84
and the police are to have taken shots that have made me, made my stomach turn because

1560
01:44:01.84 --> 01:44:02.84
they've been a nightmare.

1561
01:44:02.84 --> 01:44:06.92
Although I already described one of these on the podcast, but that one where I saw the guy

1562
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:10.72
with the headphones on and a hoodie on couldn't hear what the cop was saying reached into

1563
01:44:10.72 --> 01:44:13.48
his pocket to turn off his iPhone and the cop drilled them.

1564
01:44:13.48 --> 01:44:15.56
You know, where was the cop standing?

1565
01:44:15.56 --> 01:44:18.000
He was standing out and the wide open.

1566
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.36
And then wide open of a 7-11 parking lot.

1567
01:44:20.36 --> 01:44:22.40
So he has no cover, no concealment.

1568
01:44:22.40 --> 01:44:23.40
He's yelling at this guy.

1569
01:44:23.40 --> 01:44:25.64
The guy turns around, wants to shut off his iPhone.

1570
01:44:25.64 --> 01:44:28.68
Where he's listening to music so he can hear what the cop was saying.

1571
01:44:28.68 --> 01:44:29.68
Cop drills him.

1572
01:44:29.68 --> 01:44:31.56
And the call was, you know, guy with a gun.

1573
01:44:31.56 --> 01:44:39.76
So I understand the anger at police when police make bad shots.

1574
01:44:39.76 --> 01:44:43.80
But let's figure out, let's let's let's let's we just talked about this.

1575
01:44:43.80 --> 01:44:45.64
Let's not be temperamental about it.

1576
01:44:45.64 --> 01:44:47.16
Let's not use rage.

1577
01:44:47.16 --> 01:44:49.000
Let's that's not going to solve the problem.

1578
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.08
What is going to solve the problem is take a step back.

1579
01:44:51.08 --> 01:44:55.88
Let's analyze what we can do as citizens to deescalate all these situations.

1580
01:44:55.88 --> 01:45:02.64
I mean, that's a good idea right there about let the, you know, in your high school,

1581
01:45:02.64 --> 01:45:07.84
your example's high school, but let the citizen know how it feels to be the cop.

1582
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:08.84
Because really, that's all you see.

1583
01:45:08.84 --> 01:45:11.88
Because the cop has all this power, you know, and all this stuff.

1584
01:45:11.88 --> 01:45:12.88
But they don't know.

1585
01:45:12.88 --> 01:45:16.48
I think when they see that kind of stuff, they don't know because because of the emotions

1586
01:45:16.48 --> 01:45:18.12
that get invoked when they see it.

1587
01:45:18.12 --> 01:45:24.28
So if they understand, that's like a two-way street to facilitate that learning process.

1588
01:45:24.28 --> 01:45:28.60
So when you, so let's say that was a common thing.

1589
01:45:28.60 --> 01:45:31.04
That was one of like a normal thing, one of the normal things.

1590
01:45:31.04 --> 01:45:32.04
We're always a common thing.

1591
01:45:32.04 --> 01:45:36.68
For it, to people who go through this training, and that was just kind of part of our culture,

1592
01:45:36.68 --> 01:45:41.56
you know, where as a citizen, we know we're well aware of what cops go through and all

1593
01:45:41.56 --> 01:45:43.84
this stuff because we've been through it and we understand.

1594
01:45:43.84 --> 01:45:50.40
We just totally understand that would make the whole landscape of cop versus, or cops working

1595
01:45:50.40 --> 01:45:54.96
alongside with citizens, you would stick out like a sore thumb when someone was suspicious.

1596
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:59.32
Other ways people would be just, yeah, I know exactly what to do with black clockwork routine.

1597
01:45:59.32 --> 01:46:05.36
And myself, I've done vehicle introduction over in Iraq, and I know what it's like to walk up those cars

1598
01:46:05.36 --> 01:46:07.32
and see what those people are looking like.

1599
01:46:07.32 --> 01:46:10.32
And so when I get pulled over by the cops, which hasn't happened to me a lot, but you know,

1600
01:46:10.32 --> 01:46:12.32
speed, I've gotten busted for speeding.

1601
01:46:12.32 --> 01:46:14.40
I'm sorry, since it's a forgettable.

1602
01:46:14.40 --> 01:46:15.68
But you know, I've got pulled over.

1603
01:46:15.68 --> 01:46:16.68
I'm, you know, totally.

1604
01:46:16.68 --> 01:46:17.68
Totally.

1605
01:46:17.68 --> 01:46:18.68
Disappointing goes for it.

1606
01:46:18.68 --> 01:46:19.68
Yeah.

1607
01:46:19.68 --> 01:46:19.68
Totally.

1608
01:46:19.68 --> 01:46:22.44
Which just just hands very slow movements.

1609
01:46:22.44 --> 01:46:25.56
I don't, you know, I want to make their job as easy as possible.

1610
01:46:25.56 --> 01:46:30.36
As easy as possible, because I know they're stressed, you know, hey, officer, how you doing?

1611
01:46:30.36 --> 01:46:32.56
Sorry, it's going a little fast.

1612
01:46:32.56 --> 01:46:33.68
You know, what do you want from me?

1613
01:46:33.68 --> 01:46:35.88
Yeah, I'm here to comply.

1614
01:46:35.88 --> 01:46:36.88
On that note, too.

1615
01:46:36.88 --> 01:46:39.16
I mean, of course, they're going to be, they're going to be police.

1616
01:46:39.16 --> 01:46:43.40
They don't make good decisions and maybe go over the top or maybe they're, you know,

1617
01:46:43.40 --> 01:46:47.32
they lost their cool for some other issue or they, or they get a call.

1618
01:46:47.32 --> 01:46:49.20
I mean, often, and this was kind of where I was going.

1619
01:46:49.20 --> 01:46:53.16
I was talking about this earlier was if they get a call, like I saw an armed guy or you

1620
01:46:53.16 --> 01:46:56.72
fit the description of someone you're looking for, they're already seeing use of threat.

1621
01:46:56.72 --> 01:47:01.48
So having that, you know, if you feel like you're not getting, and believe me, this is,

1622
01:47:01.48 --> 01:47:04.68
this is always the kind of myth in our culture as well.

1623
01:47:04.68 --> 01:47:11.16
I'm about as a white boy as you can get as, you know, a blonde headed, a pale skin guy.

1624
01:47:11.16 --> 01:47:12.88
I've been mistreated by the police.

1625
01:47:12.88 --> 01:47:13.88
That's for sure.

1626
01:47:13.88 --> 01:47:19.24
And when that was happening, when I got shelved on the ground, a little short real shotgun

1627
01:47:19.24 --> 01:47:25.48
jammed into my skull, even when I was being compliant, I didn't lose my cool because what

1628
01:47:25.48 --> 01:47:26.48
is that game me?

1629
01:47:26.48 --> 01:47:27.92
I'm not going to resist to rest.

1630
01:47:27.92 --> 01:47:31.56
I'm just going to, I'm going to, I got to suck that up.

1631
01:47:31.56 --> 01:47:34.56
Then I can, you know, if you want to, I'm going to complain about my rights later, I can

1632
01:47:34.56 --> 01:47:35.56
do that.

1633
01:47:35.56 --> 01:47:42.32
You know, I was being a knucklehead as a young guy back in the day, but, and I probably

1634
01:47:42.32 --> 01:47:43.32
deserve to be roughed up.

1635
01:47:43.32 --> 01:47:46.60
But if it's, it was one of those things where like, then now it's not that time to complain

1636
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:47.60
about it.

1637
01:47:47.60 --> 01:47:51.24
You cooperate with the police, and you want to file a complaint later, you can do that.

1638
01:47:51.24 --> 01:47:52.24
Yes.

1639
01:47:52.24 --> 01:47:56.08
Yeah, and that typically ends up to be, well, I mean, I guess, you know, it's debatable,

1640
01:47:56.08 --> 01:48:02.24
I guess, but that typically becomes the best discourse because at the time, if a copper

1641
01:48:02.24 --> 01:48:07.96
whoever, whoever, you see a balancer, so it's on a way lower level, it's kind of the same

1642
01:48:07.96 --> 01:48:08.96
thing.

1643
01:48:08.96 --> 01:48:12.56
I remember those days ago, I think you had to bounce me out of the bar a few times.

1644
01:48:12.56 --> 01:48:14.88
Yeah, probably.

1645
01:48:14.88 --> 01:48:22.64
But if, if you start taking it right then and there where, you know, you're losing a temper

1646
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:26.72
or something like that, making the job difficult, like just like you said, like, that's

1647
01:48:26.72 --> 01:48:30.56
not going to, you're not going to recapture your rights at that time.

1648
01:48:30.56 --> 01:48:34.000
Like if you think your rights are being violated, you're not going to, you're not going

1649
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.04
to get your rights back at that time.

1650
01:48:36.04 --> 01:48:37.04
The ones that are being violated.

1651
01:48:37.04 --> 01:48:38.80
Let me say some worse than that.

1652
01:48:38.80 --> 01:48:43.000
You have a rookie cop that doesn't know what he's doing that well and he, for whatever

1653
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.64
reason, decides he's going to take that shock on off safe or he decides he's going to

1654
01:48:47.64 --> 01:48:51.08
put the finger on the trigger and now you start jerking around and moving and all of a sudden

1655
01:48:51.08 --> 01:48:53.68
you got an accidental discharge into your head.

1656
01:48:53.68 --> 01:48:57.08
So that's not real beneficial.

1657
01:48:57.08 --> 01:48:58.08
Right.

1658
01:48:58.08 --> 01:49:02.12
But even before before it gets to that, it think about just the person who's going to make

1659
01:49:02.12 --> 01:49:07.44
the decision to either resist or put up a fight about their rights or, you know, or this

1660
01:49:07.44 --> 01:49:11.72
officer being a power trip, having a power trip or whatever, just think about that person's

1661
01:49:11.72 --> 01:49:12.72
decision making.

1662
01:49:12.72 --> 01:49:13.72
Right.

1663
01:49:13.72 --> 01:49:15.16
Rather, as opposed to, we're going to let this happen.

1664
01:49:15.16 --> 01:49:18.24
I'm going to cooperate fully, regardless of your power trip, regardless of the rights

1665
01:49:18.24 --> 01:49:19.68
that you violated or whatever.

1666
01:49:19.68 --> 01:49:24.72
And then if I believe that my rights are violated to pursue it later, like you're saying,

1667
01:49:24.72 --> 01:49:27.76
because if you choose to pursue it right then and there, it's not going to work out.

1668
01:49:27.76 --> 01:49:31.44
And you actually now, I'm sitting here thinking about this, it doesn't need to be like

1669
01:49:31.44 --> 01:49:32.44
a high school education thing.

1670
01:49:32.44 --> 01:49:33.44
It'd have to be great.

1671
01:49:33.44 --> 01:49:38.84
But like, what could we do in the media, the government, the police should get together

1672
01:49:38.84 --> 01:49:41.36
and start making videos of saying, hey, here's what's going on.

1673
01:49:41.36 --> 01:49:44.12
Here's what the cops feel and here's what the cops think and watch this live.

1674
01:49:44.12 --> 01:49:45.24
You know, there's plenty of body cams.

1675
01:49:45.24 --> 01:49:46.68
Now you can say, here's what the cops think.

1676
01:49:46.68 --> 01:49:51.80
And here's what, like, they just had a shooting of a white guy up in Northern California

1677
01:49:51.80 --> 01:49:53.16
a little bit ago.

1678
01:49:53.16 --> 01:49:58.20
And he, you know, they showed him reaching for his reaching behind him after he's being

1679
01:49:58.20 --> 01:50:03.56
combative and walking towards people. So it would be cool to just freeze that frame and say,

1680
01:50:03.56 --> 01:50:07.52
this is what a police officer is thinking right now when you're doing this.

1681
01:50:07.52 --> 01:50:09.92
He's thinking, does this guy have a gun?

1682
01:50:09.92 --> 01:50:11.52
Here's the report that I got.

1683
01:50:11.52 --> 01:50:13.92
Here's the situation I'm in.

1684
01:50:13.92 --> 01:50:18.20
Well, think about what you're doing and do the right thing.

1685
01:50:18.20 --> 01:50:20.16
If you're getting told to get down, get down.

1686
01:50:20.16 --> 01:50:23.04
If you're getting told to show your hands, show your hands.

1687
01:50:23.04 --> 01:50:25.12
And I think we got to start educating.

1688
01:50:25.12 --> 01:50:28.52
We're going to start training, art police better. They deserve it.

1689
01:50:28.52 --> 01:50:33.52
We owe that to them so that they know how to work as an individual to use cover, as

1690
01:50:33.52 --> 01:50:36.24
pairs to use cover move, as elements to use cover move.

1691
01:50:36.24 --> 01:50:40.48
And then we need to put them in the stressful realistic environments that are changing

1692
01:50:40.48 --> 01:50:43.44
all the time that they've lived to learn how to think now.

1693
01:50:43.44 --> 01:50:50.92
And then on the civilian side, our civilians need to be educated as well on how to get

1694
01:50:50.92 --> 01:50:53.16
arrested, how to comply.

1695
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:55.92
What it feels like to be on the other side.

1696
01:50:55.92 --> 01:50:56.92
Yeah.

1697
01:50:56.92 --> 01:51:04.80
And like I said, I think that does create this overall understanding of the process.

1698
01:51:04.80 --> 01:51:07.04
Like remember, you should be a bouncer.

1699
01:51:07.04 --> 01:51:09.40
And it's like check IDs, right?

1700
01:51:09.40 --> 01:51:10.40
Check IDs.

1701
01:51:10.40 --> 01:51:15.24
And when someone has a fake ID, usually you can tell in their behavior.

1702
01:51:15.24 --> 01:51:17.92
And I'm not saying I can tell a guy's under my nature, whatever.

1703
01:51:17.92 --> 01:51:19.60
If they're behavior, I'm not saying that.

1704
01:51:19.60 --> 01:51:24.88
But if there's some suspicion or whatever, his behavior is going to tell more of the tale.

1705
01:51:24.88 --> 01:51:30.84
But there is this kind of standard operating kind of way, when you present your ID, show

1706
01:51:30.84 --> 01:51:34.16
your ID, you be quiet and you just kind of stand there so they can look at your face,

1707
01:51:34.16 --> 01:51:35.16
the bouncer.

1708
01:51:35.16 --> 01:51:37.40
I'm just saying that's what typically what people do automatically.

1709
01:51:37.40 --> 01:51:40.80
But when people do other things, it sticks up.

1710
01:51:40.80 --> 01:51:45.84
So like I said, I think how you're saying, if there is this understanding, I know how

1711
01:51:45.84 --> 01:51:48.88
it is to be the cop, I know how to get arrested.

1712
01:51:48.88 --> 01:51:49.88
They'll do that.

1713
01:51:49.88 --> 01:51:54.84
No create this pattern like I said, where when they are acting suspicious, it won't

1714
01:51:54.84 --> 01:51:56.56
be he was just kind of generally suspicious.

1715
01:51:56.56 --> 01:51:57.84
It'll stick out way more.

1716
01:51:57.84 --> 01:51:58.84
Exactly.

1717
01:51:58.84 --> 01:52:00.16
It's a good idea, man.

1718
01:52:00.16 --> 01:52:04.32
I don't think I've heard that before.

1719
01:52:04.32 --> 01:52:05.32
Life.

1720
01:52:05.32 --> 01:52:06.32
Next question.

1721
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:10.80
Metallica or Pantera.

1722
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:15.68
This is open up a big ganty worms because we used to have quite a big debate about this

1723
01:52:15.68 --> 01:52:18.84
and tube ruser.

1724
01:52:18.84 --> 01:52:24.52
Back in the day, and Jaco gave me a hard time because I grew up in the Metallica black

1725
01:52:24.52 --> 01:52:30.68
album there, which Jaco didn't even consider real Metallica.

1726
01:52:30.68 --> 01:52:35.64
It was going to old school, ride the lightning kill him all.

1727
01:52:35.64 --> 01:52:37.84
But yeah, for me it was funny.

1728
01:52:37.84 --> 01:52:41.96
I see the thing about Vietnam, the Vietnam War and these guys are going to the Vietnam

1729
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:45.20
War and they're listening to.

1730
01:52:45.20 --> 01:52:51.44
And then, cross-be stills a Nash.

1731
01:52:51.44 --> 01:52:53.48
They're listening to the grateful dead.

1732
01:52:53.48 --> 01:52:56.40
I mean, a large portion of population was.

1733
01:52:56.40 --> 01:53:01.32
We're going to war listening to Metallica kill him all.

1734
01:53:01.32 --> 01:53:02.92
It's a little mindset, Shedd.

1735
01:53:02.92 --> 01:53:03.92
That's pretty good.

1736
01:53:03.92 --> 01:53:10.36
I got to say though, I think Pantera crush is Metallica and I got to say that Cowboys

1737
01:53:10.36 --> 01:53:16.28
from hell is probably the greatest rock song of all time.

1738
01:53:16.28 --> 01:53:25.36
I actually really like the early Metallica and then I thought the Pantera got better after

1739
01:53:25.36 --> 01:53:27.96
that album and moved towards Volga to play.

1740
01:53:27.96 --> 01:53:28.96
Volga to play a part of it.

1741
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:33.08
When they stepped up and went harder, hold your mouth to war as opposed to Metallica who

1742
01:53:33.08 --> 01:53:34.92
got softer.

1743
01:53:34.92 --> 01:53:37.12
So big and both.

1744
01:53:37.12 --> 01:53:44.48
And when I got to Seal Team 1, there was a big stereo system in the gym and it had a glass

1745
01:53:44.48 --> 01:53:48.84
case in front of it and they'd weld it like a rod into the case where you couldn't open

1746
01:53:48.84 --> 01:53:49.84
it.

1747
01:53:49.84 --> 01:53:54.08
You couldn't open the case and it was locked shut in the first five.

1748
01:53:54.08 --> 01:53:55.08
You remember the old days?

1749
01:53:55.08 --> 01:53:57.88
They had the CD disc changes.

1750
01:53:57.88 --> 01:54:01.36
There was, you know, this was a five disc CD changer.

1751
01:54:01.36 --> 01:54:04.76
The first five Metallica albums were in there and they could not be removed.

1752
01:54:04.76 --> 01:54:07.76
And that, if you went in the gym, that's where you're listening to back in the day,

1753
01:54:07.76 --> 01:54:08.76
T1 style.

1754
01:54:08.76 --> 01:54:10.76
Good done.

1755
01:54:10.76 --> 01:54:13.28
All right.

1756
01:54:13.28 --> 01:54:18.64
I'd like to hear what you both think regarding the deaths of Buds trainees in the past few

1757
01:54:18.64 --> 01:54:22.64
months.

1758
01:54:22.64 --> 01:54:25.80
Yeah, look, this is something that's been all over the news.

1759
01:54:25.80 --> 01:54:30.60
Our Buds is basic underwater demolition seal training and that is, that is the basic seal

1760
01:54:30.60 --> 01:54:31.60
training program.

1761
01:54:31.60 --> 01:54:36.04
That's the pipeline that we all go through that, that we graduate from.

1762
01:54:36.04 --> 01:54:39.76
It's about a 27 week program or so.

1763
01:54:39.76 --> 01:54:41.64
It's got a 70, 80% of Trisha and Raid.

1764
01:54:41.64 --> 01:54:44.72
It's why they consider some of the toughest military training in the world.

1765
01:54:44.72 --> 01:54:49.92
It's tough training and it needs to be tough training because we expect seals to be able

1766
01:54:49.92 --> 01:54:54.40
perform in a very high level on very dangerous battlefields across the globe and a lot

1767
01:54:54.40 --> 01:54:57.76
of highly dynamic and high pressure situations.

1768
01:54:57.76 --> 01:55:01.000
So we got to keep those standard tie.

1769
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.96
One thing that's misleading is there was, they're saying, well, three deaths happened

1770
01:55:06.96 --> 01:55:08.24
in a short period of time.

1771
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:12.16
If you want's back at Buds and that's actually not true.

1772
01:55:12.16 --> 01:55:16.84
It wasn't two of those, two of the three deaths actually didn't happen in training.

1773
01:55:16.84 --> 01:55:19.12
And so people need to understand that.

1774
01:55:19.12 --> 01:55:20.96
So what were the three deaths?

1775
01:55:20.96 --> 01:55:26.12
So there was a one, one death actually happened in training.

1776
01:55:26.12 --> 01:55:31.92
There was a death of a student that drowned in the pool, walk on to an evolution and the

1777
01:55:31.92 --> 01:55:33.40
instructors were there.

1778
01:55:33.40 --> 01:55:36.64
They tried to resuscitate him, got him in the hospital, but they couldn't bring him back.

1779
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:37.64
He was going.

1780
01:55:37.64 --> 01:55:39.72
So that is a training death.

1781
01:55:39.72 --> 01:55:41.08
That's the one training death.

1782
01:55:41.08 --> 01:55:47.72
The two others that happened was a student that quit training, dropped, he dropped on requests

1783
01:55:47.72 --> 01:55:51.76
as we call it, which is again, most of the students that go there, this ends up happening

1784
01:55:51.76 --> 01:55:55.24
head, and dressed most people quit.

1785
01:55:55.24 --> 01:55:59.88
That the 78% of nutrition rate means most of those folks are walking away.

1786
01:55:59.88 --> 01:56:05.24
So they're ringing the bell and dropping on requests, which is, you know, quit the program.

1787
01:56:05.24 --> 01:56:11.90
So a horrible situation, but this individual, the student, apparently that was waiting

1788
01:56:11.90 --> 01:56:15.36
heavily on him that he quit his dream, he got a buzz.

1789
01:56:15.36 --> 01:56:23.08
And on Liberty, meaning he quit, and then he went out, wasn't under supervision anymore,

1790
01:56:23.08 --> 01:56:29.04
went into downtown San Diego, went to a hotel, jumped off the 22nd floor, killed himself,

1791
01:56:29.04 --> 01:56:31.000
which is horrible, which is horrible.

1792
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.16
But that was not a training death.

1793
01:56:33.16 --> 01:56:36.04
Even though he was attached to the community at the time, and there's certainly I'm sure

1794
01:56:36.04 --> 01:56:41.68
they're taking some substantial steps to maybe try to monitor guys a little bit more.

1795
01:56:41.68 --> 01:56:47.08
You can't put, you can't, while horrible and tragic, and they're going to try to do everything

1796
01:56:47.08 --> 01:56:48.08
you can to prevent that.

1797
01:56:48.08 --> 01:56:52.20
You can't put guys in jail for six weeks after they quit.

1798
01:56:52.20 --> 01:56:54.20
I mean, you can't be with him 24, seven.

1799
01:56:54.20 --> 01:56:59.72
So I think it's hard to hold the center responsible, our training center responsible for that

1800
01:56:59.72 --> 01:57:00.72
death.

1801
01:57:00.72 --> 01:57:04.96
And the other one that happened was another guy who had quit training, a student who had quit

1802
01:57:04.96 --> 01:57:09.12
training while on Liberty got drunk and crashed his car.

1803
01:57:09.12 --> 01:57:10.12
It was killed in a fucking rest.

1804
01:57:10.12 --> 01:57:11.12
It was a car.

1805
01:57:11.12 --> 01:57:12.12
I think it was a car.

1806
01:57:12.12 --> 01:57:17.96
Yeah, well, you know what, I think you just kind of explained these things.

1807
01:57:17.96 --> 01:57:22.08
You know, one of his training death training deaths shouldn't happen.

1808
01:57:22.08 --> 01:57:23.08
That's horrible when it happens.

1809
01:57:23.08 --> 01:57:26.24
A lot of times there's been other drownings in the past.

1810
01:57:26.24 --> 01:57:30.96
Oftentimes there's some kind of a, some kind of a medical issue that the person had.

1811
01:57:30.96 --> 01:57:34.48
I don't know what the results of this guy's autopsy are.

1812
01:57:34.48 --> 01:57:37.84
But the guy that killed himself, this was one thing that I found interesting.

1813
01:57:37.84 --> 01:57:42.16
I was talking to one of the guys, one of my buddies that works over there still.

1814
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:44.68
And I saw picture the guy that killed himself.

1815
01:57:44.68 --> 01:57:47.44
And dude, look like a stud, you know.

1816
01:57:47.44 --> 01:57:53.000
He had a couple pictures of him.

1817
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.68
He almost looked like a professional photography of a guy.

1818
01:57:55.68 --> 01:58:01.92
He was like a rugby player and he was kind of, just look like a stud.

1819
01:58:01.92 --> 01:58:03.52
And I mentioned this to my buddy.

1820
01:58:03.52 --> 01:58:05.80
That's an instructor over there said, hey man, that guy looked like a stud.

1821
01:58:05.80 --> 01:58:06.80
What's going on?

1822
01:58:06.80 --> 01:58:12.32
And my buddy said, hey, Jocco, they're all studs.

1823
01:58:12.32 --> 01:58:15.56
So when I went through training, no one knew about the seal teams.

1824
01:58:15.56 --> 01:58:21.68
It wasn't this big giant, you know, we didn't have this huge publicity that we have now.

1825
01:58:21.68 --> 01:58:23.96
And so if you want to go to the seal teams, you kind of had to search it out.

1826
01:58:23.96 --> 01:58:28.04
It wasn't just going to, the seal teams weren't going to just land on your doorstep.

1827
01:58:28.04 --> 01:58:29.96
You had to figure it out and go for it.

1828
01:58:29.96 --> 01:58:33.96
And so there was, there wasn't a lot of, there was all kinds of knuckleheads going through

1829
01:58:33.96 --> 01:58:35.36
training.

1830
01:58:35.36 --> 01:58:38.40
And he said, he said, when you look down the line and you look at, when you talk to these

1831
01:58:38.40 --> 01:58:41.12
kids, they're the captain of the team.

1832
01:58:41.12 --> 01:58:43.48
They're the class president of the high school.

1833
01:58:43.48 --> 01:58:45.12
They're, they're studs.

1834
01:58:45.12 --> 01:58:47.72
And so it's no, it's no different with this kid.

1835
01:58:47.72 --> 01:58:49.56
The kid was a stud.

1836
01:58:49.56 --> 01:58:55.04
And I think, and actually in reading some of the articles about him, he, this was his

1837
01:58:55.04 --> 01:58:56.48
life long dream.

1838
01:58:56.48 --> 01:58:58.76
He had told everybody, I'm going to be a seal.

1839
01:58:58.76 --> 01:58:59.76
I'm going to be a seal.

1840
01:58:59.76 --> 01:59:00.76
I'm going to be a seal.

1841
01:59:00.76 --> 01:59:02.56
And I think he quit on Wednesday.

1842
01:59:02.56 --> 01:59:03.56
I want to say a win.

1843
01:59:03.56 --> 01:59:04.56
I don't know.

1844
01:59:04.56 --> 01:59:05.56
I don't know when he quit.

1845
01:59:05.56 --> 01:59:07.44
But he quit in how weak.

1846
01:59:07.44 --> 01:59:11.72
And since he told everybody that's what he's going to do, you know, that was the stress

1847
01:59:11.72 --> 01:59:15.08
was too much to bear to go back to everybody and say, yeah, I didn't make it.

1848
01:59:15.08 --> 01:59:17.12
So I just want to be clear.

1849
01:59:17.12 --> 01:59:18.28
I mean, these are horrible.

1850
01:59:18.28 --> 01:59:19.28
It's horrible.

1851
01:59:19.28 --> 01:59:20.28
Absolutely.

1852
01:59:20.28 --> 01:59:23.36
Young, you know, good young men who aspire to be seals and whether they're killed

1853
01:59:23.36 --> 01:59:28.28
in them auto-axonate, you know, drinking a drive or not or, you know, a suicide.

1854
01:59:28.28 --> 01:59:29.28
This is horrible.

1855
01:59:29.28 --> 01:59:30.28
And we want to try to prevent that.

1856
01:59:30.28 --> 01:59:34.16
I'm sure I know that our training center is doing everything they can to try to prevent

1857
01:59:34.16 --> 01:59:35.16
that.

1858
01:59:35.16 --> 01:59:37.48
But again, you can't lock these guys up.

1859
01:59:37.48 --> 01:59:39.000
You can't be at some point.

1860
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.20
They have to be released to be on liberty.

1861
01:59:41.20 --> 01:59:43.04
They, we can't be with them 24, 7.

1862
01:59:43.04 --> 01:59:46.40
So, you know, you can counsel guys, you can talk to folks.

1863
01:59:46.40 --> 01:59:50.56
And what's the shame about, you know, the, the, the, the suicide is, I mean, some of

1864
01:59:50.56 --> 01:59:57.04
of the best guys we serve with guys like Mark Lee and Mike Montzure both had quit

1865
01:59:57.04 --> 01:59:58.92
boats, rang out.

1866
01:59:58.92 --> 02:00:02.76
Got some maturity, went to the fleet, you know, worked hard to get ready and come

1867
02:00:02.76 --> 02:00:06.48
back, came back, knocked that training out of the park and we're out of stands team

1868
02:00:06.48 --> 02:00:07.48
guys.

1869
02:00:07.48 --> 02:00:10.92
So that's just, that's a horrible tragedy, definitely.

1870
02:00:10.92 --> 02:00:14.28
But I think what's important for people to understand is, you know, for the actual training

1871
02:00:14.28 --> 02:00:18.12
death, this stuff is there's a lot of protocols in place.

1872
02:00:18.12 --> 02:00:20.88
It's very, it's very, when I was an instructor there.

1873
02:00:20.88 --> 02:00:21.88
They're exuberant.

1874
02:00:21.88 --> 02:00:22.88
They're exuberant.

1875
02:00:22.88 --> 02:00:25.60
Yeah, so I don't know, life wasn't instructor at but I was never an instructor at

1876
02:00:25.60 --> 02:00:26.92
but it's, but life worked there.

1877
02:00:26.92 --> 02:00:28.16
You worked hell weeks.

1878
02:00:28.16 --> 02:00:29.16
I did.

1879
02:00:29.16 --> 02:00:31.68
And so what you don't realize when you're going to do as a student, it just seems like

1880
02:00:31.68 --> 02:00:35.16
me and these guys are, you know, putting you all these difficult, these difficult things.

1881
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:36.92
Well, it's very controlled.

1882
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:37.92
It's very controlled.

1883
02:00:37.92 --> 02:00:42.80
There's, you know, there's, there's a lot of supervision and there's a lot of different

1884
02:00:42.80 --> 02:00:46.96
safety checks and medical checks and all those things that are happening all the time

1885
02:00:46.96 --> 02:00:49.48
that are going on behind the scenes that the students don't even realize.

1886
02:00:49.48 --> 02:00:53.08
So, you know, it doesn't mean every instructor always behaves the way they ship, but

1887
02:00:53.08 --> 02:00:55.16
most of those guys are outstanding professionals.

1888
02:00:55.16 --> 02:01:01.04
There are levels of leadership that are there to ensure that they perform well and do what

1889
02:01:01.04 --> 02:01:02.04
they should do.

1890
02:01:02.04 --> 02:01:04.60
And almost every case, that's, you know, that's the case.

1891
02:01:04.60 --> 02:01:06.56
Those instructors are doing an outstanding job.

1892
02:01:06.56 --> 02:01:12.16
I think the, the important thing here too is to understand that those standards have

1893
02:01:12.16 --> 02:01:13.52
got to be high.

1894
02:01:13.52 --> 02:01:16.000
And there are people, a lot of people outside the SEAL teams.

1895
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.36
We've had a lot of pressure on us right now, particularly with the push to open up all

1896
02:01:21.36 --> 02:01:26.40
special operations and infantry units to women.

1897
02:01:26.40 --> 02:01:32.64
This is a, this is a new push under the administration and our, our secretary of the Navy,

1898
02:01:32.64 --> 02:01:37.20
Ray Maybus has been all over this and pushing that and wants to see women graduate from

1899
02:01:37.20 --> 02:01:38.20
the SEAL teams.

1900
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:40.48
And I think that's pretty, he's pretty open about that.

1901
02:01:40.48 --> 02:01:47.48
And so, this is, I think the danger here in the concern I have is that they'll use something

1902
02:01:47.48 --> 02:01:53.32
like this, the politicians who don't know what, what makes a good SEAL.

1903
02:01:53.32 --> 02:01:56.24
You know, they, they like, they like, they like to think they do, but they don't, they

1904
02:01:56.24 --> 02:01:58.40
have no idea what makes a good SEAL.

1905
02:01:58.40 --> 02:02:01.32
And they don't understand how difficult combat is.

1906
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:04.52
You know, people ask us sometimes, Jack, when I get questions like, tell us a good bud

1907
02:02:04.52 --> 02:02:09.24
story, like, we don't talk about buds because everybody's meant to buds in the SEAL teams.

1908
02:02:09.24 --> 02:02:11.44
And, and listen, buds is the kick in the nuts.

1909
02:02:11.44 --> 02:02:13.44
It's a, it's a good training program.

1910
02:02:13.44 --> 02:02:15.04
There's some stuff that's hard.

1911
02:02:15.04 --> 02:02:17.64
Certainly, there's some stuff that wouldn't as hard as I thought it was, you know, it was

1912
02:02:17.64 --> 02:02:19.04
going to be or should have been.

1913
02:02:19.04 --> 02:02:22.96
But a lot of it's quite challenging and difficult.

1914
02:02:22.96 --> 02:02:24.08
But it's a screening process.

1915
02:02:24.08 --> 02:02:27.88
And to, to weed out the guys that we don't believe have the characteristics that are going

1916
02:02:27.88 --> 02:02:31.96
to be able to be able to succeed on the battlefield, a lot of that is just the will to succeed

1917
02:02:31.96 --> 02:02:34.36
through some, in person, be able to do some really difficult challenges.

1918
02:02:34.36 --> 02:02:40.96
So it is critical that those standards remain high because combat is so much harder, physically

1919
02:02:40.96 --> 02:02:41.96
harder than training.

1920
02:02:41.96 --> 02:02:42.96
Yeah, that's what it's about.

1921
02:02:42.96 --> 02:02:45.20
So you said, hey, it's important that we find that they have to will.

1922
02:02:45.20 --> 02:02:52.08
There's also a level of physical toughness that you have to have that there just is.

1923
02:02:52.08 --> 02:02:56.76
And when I say physical toughness, I'm talking about the actual ability to, for your body

1924
02:02:56.76 --> 02:02:59.12
to withstand wear and tear.

1925
02:02:59.12 --> 02:03:04.32
And that's one keep, you know, with the 80% attrition rate, not all those people are people

1926
02:03:04.32 --> 02:03:05.32
that quit.

1927
02:03:05.32 --> 02:03:06.96
It's people that can't stand the cold.

1928
02:03:06.96 --> 02:03:09.12
They physically can't handle the cold.

1929
02:03:09.12 --> 02:03:13.36
It's people that physically can't handle the stress on your shoulders, on your neck, on

1930
02:03:13.36 --> 02:03:16.04
your back, on your knees, on your ankles.

1931
02:03:16.04 --> 02:03:17.20
It is in very hard court.

1932
02:03:17.20 --> 02:03:20.52
And you know, there's a great article that was written by two female marines that were in

1933
02:03:20.52 --> 02:03:24.88
Afghanistan that kind of kind of put out an outpost where they were for all practical

1934
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:29.92
purposes alongside the male marines in a field environment.

1935
02:03:29.92 --> 02:03:34.24
And they both wrote and said, women should not be doing this.

1936
02:03:34.24 --> 02:03:40.36
And by the way, they were both, they were both really awesome marines who had been like

1937
02:03:40.36 --> 02:03:42.04
some kind of collegiate athletes.

1938
02:03:42.04 --> 02:03:43.40
They were, they were studs.

1939
02:03:43.40 --> 02:03:46.44
And they just said, look, we didn't have our bodies didn't hold up.

1940
02:03:46.44 --> 02:03:48.64
And that's one of the many things, you know, you just said it.

1941
02:03:48.64 --> 02:03:51.64
When you're in combat, it's not, it's not a sport.

1942
02:03:51.64 --> 02:03:54.68
You don't get the, you don't go to the training room afterwards and get an ice bath

1943
02:03:54.68 --> 02:03:55.68
at a massage.

1944
02:03:55.68 --> 02:04:00.28
You don't, and if something happens, they don't blow the whistle and come out on the field

1945
02:04:00.28 --> 02:04:03.40
and let the trainer work on you and then pull you off and put a substance to it.

1946
02:04:03.40 --> 02:04:04.76
It doesn't happen on the battlefield.

1947
02:04:04.76 --> 02:04:06.32
And there aren't weight classes either.

1948
02:04:06.32 --> 02:04:08.76
Yeah, there's no weight classes for sure.

1949
02:04:08.76 --> 02:04:14.40
It's, so yeah, they need to maintain the standards.

1950
02:04:14.40 --> 02:04:18.40
And they need to maintain the standards.

1951
02:04:18.40 --> 02:04:22.000
I think we, we cannot allow that to slip and I think those instructors are doing

1952
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
they're out most of make sure that that happens.

1953
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.32
The other thing people need to understand too is when you're a student going through this

1954
02:04:27.32 --> 02:04:28.72
for me, this is my dream.

1955
02:04:28.72 --> 02:04:33.28
And guess what, when every time I'm going to med a medical check during our hell week, which

1956
02:04:33.28 --> 02:04:36.88
they do, you know, every day, you're getting checked every morning and they're taking

1957
02:04:36.88 --> 02:04:42.28
your temperature and they're, you know, they're taking your SBO2 and making sure that you

1958
02:04:42.28 --> 02:04:48.08
don't have pneumonia, you don't have some other, you know, dangerous physical medical condition.

1959
02:04:48.08 --> 02:04:52.000
Um, you're sweating it out.

1960
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:55.000
You're sweating it out because you know, you know, I'm not going to quit this training,

1961
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:56.84
but what if something that I can't control happens?

1962
02:04:56.84 --> 02:04:59.12
What if I get pneumonia, I get fluid in my lungs?

1963
02:04:59.12 --> 02:05:03.08
What if I get sick or something happens or I get some infection in my leg or I break, you

1964
02:05:03.08 --> 02:05:05.28
know, my ankle, I mean, these things happen to guys.

1965
02:05:05.28 --> 02:05:09.20
And so then you end up, you can get roll that a training, maybe it's just compounds

1966
02:05:09.20 --> 02:05:10.20
and doing issues.

1967
02:05:10.20 --> 02:05:13.52
So you're doing your utmost to make it through those medical checks and people need to

1968
02:05:13.52 --> 02:05:17.92
understand that the, the students are trying to get under the radar and make it happen

1969
02:05:17.92 --> 02:05:19.72
and we'll often push through injuries.

1970
02:05:19.72 --> 02:05:24.92
A mutual friend of ours made it all the way through his hell week with a broken ankle,

1971
02:05:24.92 --> 02:05:25.92
you know, running on it.

1972
02:05:25.92 --> 02:05:27.72
They just wasn't going to stop.

1973
02:05:27.72 --> 02:05:28.72
Just be tough.

1974
02:05:28.72 --> 02:05:29.72
Was it going to stop?

1975
02:05:29.72 --> 02:05:30.72
He was being tough.

1976
02:05:30.72 --> 02:05:34.12
So, you know, so that's the kind of people that we want in the seal teams, you know, but

1977
02:05:34.12 --> 02:05:37.76
on the other hand, instructor staff has a difficult job because they have to make sure

1978
02:05:37.76 --> 02:05:39.52
that those guys are hurting themselves.

1979
02:05:39.52 --> 02:05:43.44
And I've actually talked to, uh, I've talked to some folks who wanted to go in those

1980
02:05:43.44 --> 02:05:47.60
sealed teams and had some medical condition that they, you know, they weren't getting,

1981
02:05:47.60 --> 02:05:49.000
they were failing their Navy physical.

1982
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
It's a very difficult physical exam.

1983
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.24
You have to take, you know, medical exam and the said, you know, what?

1984
02:05:57.24 --> 02:06:01.04
I just need a waiver for this and, you know, if they just give me this and I, I had to,

1985
02:06:01.04 --> 02:06:04.24
I've explained this to multiple people when they told me that, I said, listen, those

1986
02:06:04.24 --> 02:06:06.12
waivers are there to protect you.

1987
02:06:06.12 --> 02:06:09.88
They're there to protect you to make sure that you don't get killed in training or, and

1988
02:06:09.88 --> 02:06:13.16
they protect the team that, you know, when people were lying on you and your parents

1989
02:06:13.16 --> 02:06:17.04
have critical piece of gear and we're covering moving that you don't go down.

1990
02:06:17.04 --> 02:06:19.04
So because you're covering up some of the three.

1991
02:06:19.04 --> 02:06:20.04
Yeah, exactly.

1992
02:06:20.04 --> 02:06:21.56
So, you know, it's not about you.

1993
02:06:21.56 --> 02:06:23.04
It's about the mission.

1994
02:06:23.04 --> 02:06:27.04
And, and so, you know, unfortunately, this is when you're talking about these, these units,

1995
02:06:27.04 --> 02:06:29.24
it's just not everybody can participate in that.

1996
02:06:29.24 --> 02:06:32.76
Listen, I would have, I played high school football as a lineback and fullback.

1997
02:06:32.76 --> 02:06:35.32
I'm 510, you know, 200 pounds.

1998
02:06:35.32 --> 02:06:37.56
I would have loved to play it in the NFL.

1999
02:06:37.56 --> 02:06:41.36
I'm not big enough, are strong enough, are fast enough to play in the NFL.

2000
02:06:41.36 --> 02:06:47.56
So, the NFL teams are not going to benefit the if I'm playing lineback or fullback on their

2001
02:06:47.56 --> 02:06:48.56
teams.

2002
02:06:48.56 --> 02:06:49.56
They're going to be weaker.

2003
02:06:49.56 --> 02:06:51.32
They're not going to be as good.

2004
02:06:51.32 --> 02:06:53.40
So that's just the reality of it.

2005
02:06:53.40 --> 02:06:55.40
We got to keep those standards high.

2006
02:06:55.40 --> 02:06:59.40
And, you know, political pressure, I think is a very dangerous thing.

2007
02:06:59.40 --> 02:07:05.04
And, and all it takes is for, you know, we, we're lucky we have some great leaders that

2008
02:07:05.04 --> 02:07:08.20
are leading that training that are going to keep those standards high and understand how

2009
02:07:08.20 --> 02:07:09.80
important that is.

2010
02:07:09.80 --> 02:07:16.12
Unfortunately, it takes one week later, you know, to go in there and fold, fold to the political

2011
02:07:16.12 --> 02:07:19.44
pressure and, and standards drop.

2012
02:07:19.44 --> 02:07:23.36
And the world is, that darkness continues to spread.

2013
02:07:23.36 --> 02:07:28.04
Particularly with that, that conversation that we open this with is darkness spreads throughout

2014
02:07:28.04 --> 02:07:29.04
the world.

2015
02:07:29.04 --> 02:07:34.24
We need our seal teams and special operators and infantry units to perform at the highest

2016
02:07:34.24 --> 02:07:38.72
levels possible to go and be able to close with and destroy that enemy.

2017
02:07:38.72 --> 02:07:43.76
Indeed, speaking of destroying the enemy.

2018
02:07:43.76 --> 02:07:46.76
Next question is, how do you deal with rules of engagement?

2019
02:07:46.76 --> 02:07:47.76
Are they necessary?

2020
02:07:47.76 --> 02:07:50.32
Did they inhibit you?

2021
02:07:50.32 --> 02:07:52.08
This is a question we get all the time.

2022
02:07:52.08 --> 02:07:54.52
And people want to talk about rules of engagement.

2023
02:07:54.52 --> 02:07:57.16
You know, everyone, there's always complaints.

2024
02:07:57.16 --> 02:07:58.44
Guys, you come back from the battlefield.

2025
02:07:58.44 --> 02:08:01.68
Like, the rules of engagement are so stringent.

2026
02:08:01.68 --> 02:08:02.84
And these are different wars are fighting.

2027
02:08:02.84 --> 02:08:04.84
These are counter-inservancy wars.

2028
02:08:04.84 --> 02:08:11.24
And oftentimes people use the terms civilian casualties in a way that they're talking

2029
02:08:11.24 --> 02:08:13.96
about innocent civilians.

2030
02:08:13.96 --> 02:08:17.40
But what they don't realize is that everyone we're fighting is a civilian.

2031
02:08:17.40 --> 02:08:21.64
None of them are uniformed members of a opposing military.

2032
02:08:21.64 --> 02:08:23.28
They blend into the populace.

2033
02:08:23.28 --> 02:08:25.28
They act like they're normal people.

2034
02:08:25.28 --> 02:08:27.32
They hide amongst the people.

2035
02:08:27.32 --> 02:08:29.48
Sometimes use them as human shields.

2036
02:08:29.48 --> 02:08:34.32
And then they're shooting at you and shooting RPGs or machine guns at you and they maneuver.

2037
02:08:34.32 --> 02:08:37.32
So it's a very challenging environment.

2038
02:08:37.32 --> 02:08:39.56
But the rules of engagement really don't change.

2039
02:08:39.56 --> 02:08:41.56
I rule the engagement are pretty clear.

2040
02:08:41.56 --> 02:08:47.68
And you observe a hostile act, bad guys shooting at you or shooting at friendlies or

2041
02:08:47.68 --> 02:08:50.88
a hostile intent.

2042
02:08:50.88 --> 02:08:55.32
And that's where it becomes a little more grayer to say, okay, was this, was that person

2043
02:08:55.32 --> 02:08:59.68
acting in a manner that had a reasonable certainty of hostile intent?

2044
02:08:59.68 --> 02:09:05.20
So it's a judgment call up to the troops on the battlefield.

2045
02:09:05.20 --> 02:09:06.80
And those rules of engagement don't change.

2046
02:09:06.80 --> 02:09:08.64
They're always the same.

2047
02:09:08.64 --> 02:09:11.92
I think what changes is leaders, leaders change.

2048
02:09:11.92 --> 02:09:15.24
And there's some leaders that are willing to delegate that down to the lowest level

2049
02:09:15.24 --> 02:09:21.20
troopers, trust in their guys, train them, make them understand just how important it is to

2050
02:09:21.20 --> 02:09:25.72
make sure that they're operating within that rules of engagement.

2051
02:09:25.72 --> 02:09:32.08
They are not accidentally engaging some innocent person and causing collateral damage

2052
02:09:32.08 --> 02:09:34.24
that they didn't mean to.

2053
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:37.76
And there's some leaders that won't delegate that and keep it tight.

2054
02:09:37.76 --> 02:09:40.000
And I want to really scrutinize guys for making the call.

2055
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:44.08
I think the best way for us, this was an incredibly important.

2056
02:09:44.08 --> 02:09:50.52
People understand how our troops are put in a tough position because we know that anything

2057
02:09:50.52 --> 02:09:55.68
we do in today's world with social media, with news, new cycles, could be absolutely

2058
02:09:55.68 --> 02:09:59.92
a front page headline news in a heartbeat.

2059
02:09:59.92 --> 02:10:06.04
And those can have massive catastrophic effect on the entire strategy.

2060
02:10:06.04 --> 02:10:08.44
Yeah, the strategic mission.

2061
02:10:08.44 --> 02:10:11.80
So this is something that we have to deal with regularly.

2062
02:10:11.80 --> 02:10:19.68
And if guy thought he saw someone digging in the road and there were an ID layer and he

2063
02:10:19.68 --> 02:10:23.80
decided to pull the trigger on someone that he thought was an ID layer and it turns out

2064
02:10:23.80 --> 02:10:26.92
that it's not, we get investigative of that.

2065
02:10:26.92 --> 02:10:28.80
It becomes a big deal.

2066
02:10:28.80 --> 02:10:37.68
And that shooter, our US servicemen who are, or woman who engage is potentially looking

2067
02:10:37.68 --> 02:10:40.84
yet going to prison for, for something like that.

2068
02:10:40.84 --> 02:10:43.96
So it's a big deal if they violate the rules of engagement.

2069
02:10:43.96 --> 02:10:47.56
One of the ways that Jaco did an amazing job of this.

2070
02:10:47.56 --> 02:10:53.28
And one of our four principles are laws of combat that we talk about is simple.

2071
02:10:53.28 --> 02:10:59.88
And one of the ways that he did this for us was, you know, all this law, your speak,

2072
02:10:59.88 --> 02:11:02.48
a reasonable certainty of hostile intent and all these things.

2073
02:11:02.48 --> 02:11:06.24
He would stand up before we roll that the gate every time.

2074
02:11:06.24 --> 02:11:13.12
Every single operation and say, if you have to pull the trigger, you better make sure

2075
02:11:13.12 --> 02:11:16.32
the guy you're killing is bad.

2076
02:11:16.32 --> 02:11:17.84
Simple, everyone understood that.

2077
02:11:17.84 --> 02:11:21.28
And we had total faith in trust in our guys to do that.

2078
02:11:21.28 --> 02:11:26.88
And I'm so proud of that they were able to execute with tremendous discipline and minimize

2079
02:11:26.88 --> 02:11:31.64
collateral damage in a way that other units couldn't, you know, in the way we did that.

2080
02:11:31.64 --> 02:11:36.000
So I think rules of engagement are necessary.

2081
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.28
People have to understand them.

2082
02:11:37.28 --> 02:11:43.52
And it's really whether or not it's delegate it down is entirely up to a leader.

2083
02:11:43.52 --> 02:11:49.44
Yeah, and you can see the situation that led up to me lie, which we did a couple podcasts

2084
02:11:49.44 --> 02:11:54.88
ago, the rules of engagement were the way that they were briefed.

2085
02:11:54.88 --> 02:11:58.84
It wasn't, hey, make sure that people that you're killing are bad.

2086
02:11:58.84 --> 02:12:02.44
It was everyone in this area's hostel.

2087
02:12:02.44 --> 02:12:05.36
Everyone has been warned if they're to leave.

2088
02:12:05.36 --> 02:12:11.36
So everyone you see is either Vietcong or Vietcong sympathizer killed them.

2089
02:12:11.36 --> 02:12:14.68
And there's some scrutiny about whether they said killed them or not.

2090
02:12:14.68 --> 02:12:17.84
Because that, that was a pretty simple clear message.

2091
02:12:17.84 --> 02:12:25.28
But, you know, the difference in that the way that the rules of engagement were briefed

2092
02:12:25.28 --> 02:12:32.40
were definitely a, a, a, a, a cause.

2093
02:12:32.40 --> 02:12:35.04
One of the causes for the me lie masquer happening.

2094
02:12:35.04 --> 02:12:38.96
It's a, it's a awful situation.

2095
02:12:38.96 --> 02:12:40.60
Rules of engagement.

2096
02:12:40.60 --> 02:12:45.36
All right.

2097
02:12:45.36 --> 02:12:50.80
Next question is probably pretty quick, but how often would guys take shots in their body

2098
02:12:50.80 --> 02:12:53.80
armor or helmet all the time?

2099
02:12:53.80 --> 02:12:55.16
This happened all the time.

2100
02:12:55.16 --> 02:13:02.52
And when we were in that urban combat in all the sustained combat day after day after day,

2101
02:13:02.52 --> 02:13:05.96
after day, both for us in Charlie, but soon and in our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our,

2102
02:13:05.96 --> 02:13:07.16
sister, but soon, delta but soon.

2103
02:13:07.16 --> 02:13:09.40
It was operating on the other side of the city.

2104
02:13:09.40 --> 02:13:11.52
It was just, this happened regularly.

2105
02:13:11.52 --> 02:13:16.08
And we had guys, you know, who on patrol with a camel back, you know, and the, you know,

2106
02:13:16.08 --> 02:13:18.96
the camel basket is a water bladder on the back.

2107
02:13:18.96 --> 02:13:19.80
You wear the backpack.

2108
02:13:19.80 --> 02:13:23.64
It's got the little hose tube that you can, you can drink water on on the move.

2109
02:13:23.64 --> 02:13:27.52
Guys, no, no water is backpack realized later round went through it.

2110
02:13:27.52 --> 02:13:29.92
I mean, you're talking inches away, you know, from his back.

2111
02:13:29.92 --> 02:13:34.28
We had some multiple guy shot in the plates, front plate back plate.

2112
02:13:34.28 --> 02:13:39.52
And, and got one of our guys picking up over the rooftop, kind of a big gunfight.

2113
02:13:39.52 --> 02:13:43.96
Bam, takes takes, uh, all of a sudden you feel like some might punch him in the face.

2114
02:13:43.96 --> 02:13:47.24
And, uh, kind of falls back down below the roof and kind of gets up.

2115
02:13:47.24 --> 02:13:49.68
One of them, what's happening and takes off his helmet.

2116
02:13:49.68 --> 02:13:53.20
It looks as a helmet realizes he's been shot in his night vision mount, uh,

2117
02:13:53.20 --> 02:13:57.52
which meant that that round came in directly, you know, at his face.

2118
02:13:57.52 --> 02:14:01.52
Hit his hit his hit his night vision mount and ricochet up, had it hit just, you know,

2119
02:14:01.52 --> 02:14:03.04
a millimeters lower.

2120
02:14:03.04 --> 02:14:04.24
It would have taken his head off.

2121
02:14:04.24 --> 02:14:05.88
So that happened all the time.

2122
02:14:05.88 --> 02:14:09.000
And I, I'm sure, Jockel, you remember this many times.

2123
02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.36
I would, we'd put, come back from a park our homies.

2124
02:14:12.36 --> 02:14:13.20
I'd walk in the door.

2125
02:14:13.20 --> 02:14:14.36
I was, was going to check him with Jockel.

2126
02:14:14.36 --> 02:14:17.04
Let me know, you know, what, what, what happened out there?

2127
02:14:17.04 --> 02:14:20.16
What's going on, you know, what's, what's happening, you know, uh, now, you know,

2128
02:14:20.16 --> 02:14:22.68
there are other options we need to get reloaded for things to think about.

2129
02:14:22.68 --> 02:14:28.04
Walking in his office and first thing I would generally say is, God is a frog man.

2130
02:14:28.04 --> 02:14:28.84
God's a frog man.

2131
02:14:28.84 --> 02:14:29.68
He's looking out for us.

2132
02:14:29.68 --> 02:14:32.12
I don't know how we made it out of that without losing guys or, you know,

2133
02:14:32.12 --> 02:14:34.04
this was so many close calls.

2134
02:14:34.04 --> 02:14:39.52
Uh, and it was just a constant thing all the time.

2135
02:14:39.52 --> 02:14:44.88
Where your body armor, where you home, but, yeah, we, we always said guys on her.

2136
02:14:44.88 --> 02:14:48.36
And you've, you've talked about this in the podcast before, but my first

2137
02:14:48.36 --> 02:14:54.32
appointment, we would have guys that would wear body armor that was like, like six

2138
02:14:54.32 --> 02:14:55.32
inches, six inches, five inches.

2139
02:14:55.32 --> 02:14:56.32
Minimalistic body armor.

2140
02:14:56.32 --> 02:14:57.32
Tiny little body armor.

2141
02:14:57.32 --> 02:15:02.32
Nobody, you know, and, and in, in Ramadi get in those kind of gun fights,

2142
02:15:02.32 --> 02:15:04.52
everyone was like, hey, can we get a little bigger place?

2143
02:15:04.52 --> 02:15:05.52
Mm-hmm.

2144
02:15:05.52 --> 02:15:09.36
Uh, some guys weren't a cut their helmets and a half shells before we got there.

2145
02:15:09.36 --> 02:15:11.48
After we got there, is like, no, I'm not doing it.

2146
02:15:11.48 --> 02:15:12.48
Good, man.

2147
02:15:12.48 --> 02:15:15.16
Uh, some of the armor, some of the armor, some of the armor, some of the armor,

2148
02:15:15.16 --> 02:15:19.48
guys, they would have the full, they look like almost like night's the crotch

2149
02:15:19.48 --> 02:15:20.48
protected.

2150
02:15:20.48 --> 02:15:22.64
Yeah, the crotch protected the collars, the arm sleeves, the side tap,

2151
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:23.64
you play it.

2152
02:15:23.64 --> 02:15:26.28
They, they were covered up good on them because they were, uh, you know,

2153
02:15:26.28 --> 02:15:27.28
taking real risks out there.

2154
02:15:27.28 --> 02:15:30.60
So yeah, but, you know, Jody, medic, and I when he was on here, we had a little

2155
02:15:30.60 --> 02:15:34.40
conversation about body armor, they didn't often expect to be in a certain spot.

2156
02:15:34.40 --> 02:15:36.36
They weren't there and had body armor helmets on.

2157
02:15:36.36 --> 02:15:40.44
And he, you know, he's sitting there and said, I was that what I had of.

2158
02:15:40.44 --> 02:15:44.40
So where your body armor were, you know, but all the time.

2159
02:15:46.20 --> 02:15:47.68
Next one, life.

2160
02:15:48.64 --> 02:15:51.60
We truly appreciate your father's work here in Texas.

2161
02:15:53.40 --> 02:15:55.32
Would you ever consider career in politics?

2162
02:15:55.32 --> 02:15:58.40
Well, I appreciate that.

2163
02:15:58.40 --> 02:16:04.20
There's just a, sir, by understands that my dad is a U.S. Congressman now.

2164
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:09.48
He's a freshman U.S. congressman from Texas, District 36 in southeast Texas.

2165
02:16:09.48 --> 02:16:11.96
And I'm very proud of him.

2166
02:16:11.96 --> 02:16:17.56
He retired after a career as a small town dentist, you know, business,

2167
02:16:17.56 --> 02:16:18.84
selling for this.

2168
02:16:18.84 --> 02:16:22.000
This is a army and Air Force army army and Air Force veteran.

2169
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.08
And he was fed up with Washington and didn't like the options that he saw.

2170
02:16:27.08 --> 02:16:28.76
You know, that he knew we're going to be running for that seed.

2171
02:16:28.76 --> 02:16:29.40
And he said, you know what?

2172
02:16:29.40 --> 02:16:30.40
I'm throwing my hat in the ring.

2173
02:16:30.40 --> 02:16:30.92
I'm going to go up there.

2174
02:16:30.92 --> 02:16:31.88
I'm trying to make a difference.

2175
02:16:31.88 --> 02:16:34.28
And I we need more people like that in Washington.

2176
02:16:34.60 --> 02:16:38.28
That is my dad is there to make a difference and only to make a day.

2177
02:16:38.28 --> 02:16:39.80
He doesn't care about a career.

2178
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.92
He doesn't care about being there for decades and decades and decades.

2179
02:16:43.28 --> 02:16:47.12
You know, he's, he's retired and he'd rather be fishing hanging out with his grandkids.

2180
02:16:47.56 --> 02:16:50.48
And, and hunting, but he would, but he's up there.

2181
02:16:50.48 --> 02:16:55.24
He cares about the country and he is sacrificing to be there and to lead.

2182
02:16:55.24 --> 02:16:58.80
And I'm, I'm damn proud of the job that he's doing and stepping up.

2183
02:16:58.80 --> 02:17:06.04
What I consider a career in politics, I can't imagine anything to be more miserable than that.

2184
02:17:06.56 --> 02:17:07.04
You know what?

2185
02:17:07.04 --> 02:17:14.04
On the other hand, when I look at our nation, just as my dad has, has felt, you know,

2186
02:17:14.04 --> 02:17:16.08
called to do that to step up to lead.

2187
02:17:16.48 --> 02:17:18.80
You know, if we don't do it, who's going to do it?

2188
02:17:18.80 --> 02:17:20.76
So somebody has got to step up.

2189
02:17:20.76 --> 02:17:21.76
Somebody's got to lead.

2190
02:17:21.76 --> 02:17:26.64
And I think when you look at the direction of our country right now and the political climate

2191
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:32.64
and all that's going on in this electoral cycle, what I do that may be,

2192
02:17:32.64 --> 02:17:35.000
I just might be able to be talked into it.

2193
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.64
We shall see.

2194
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.20
What about you, Joko?

2195
02:17:39.20 --> 02:17:40.000
Get some.

2196
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.20
I mean, we got, we got the bumper stickers.

2197
02:17:42.20 --> 02:17:42.60
Right.

2198
02:17:42.60 --> 02:17:44.48
Joko 2016.

2199
02:17:44.48 --> 02:17:46.56
You know, see that.

2200
02:17:46.56 --> 02:17:47.24
Go Charles.

2201
02:17:47.24 --> 02:17:54.72
I think I would be running as, if I was to run for political office, I would run as dictator.

2202
02:17:54.72 --> 02:17:59.72
And it's a pre-ruler of America.

2203
02:17:59.72 --> 02:18:01.32
And that's what I thought I would do.

2204
02:18:01.32 --> 02:18:05.000
We can bring back some of the Roman rule, try and try, I'm burned.

2205
02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.68
So me and Echo, we could just take take over.

2206
02:18:08.68 --> 02:18:10.68
I don't know if I have the stomach for politics.

2207
02:18:10.68 --> 02:18:16.36
I really don't like the political arena too much.

2208
02:18:16.36 --> 02:18:21.12
And not sure it's something I would ever have the desire to do.

2209
02:18:22.32 --> 02:18:24.60
You know, I guess that's mine.

2210
02:18:24.60 --> 02:18:25.60
That's where I sit.

2211
02:18:25.60 --> 02:18:28.000
Maybe when I was 70 years old.

2212
02:18:30.56 --> 02:18:31.40
Yeah.

2213
02:18:31.40 --> 02:18:33.88
People of Asme too, you know, like, hey, if you were president,

2214
02:18:33.88 --> 02:18:34.88
what would you do?

2215
02:18:34.88 --> 02:18:36.92
You know, about the situation with Iran, you know,

2216
02:18:36.92 --> 02:18:40.12
in their development, I'm nuclear weapons or China getting, you know,

2217
02:18:40.12 --> 02:18:43.28
making big moves in the South China Sea or Russia,

2218
02:18:43.28 --> 02:18:48.08
pushing the envelope and kind of filming their noses at us.

2219
02:18:48.08 --> 02:18:50.000
And often I've told them that if I were president,

2220
02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.12
I would immediately nominate Jaco Willing

2221
02:18:53.12 --> 02:18:54.12
as Secretary of Defense.

2222
02:18:54.12 --> 02:18:57.000
We would change Secretary of Defense to the previous title

2223
02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.48
of Secretary of War.

2224
02:18:58.48 --> 02:19:01.76
And I think those problems would disappear immediately.

2225
02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.24
I think if I was president, it'd be very smart.

2226
02:19:06.24 --> 02:19:08.48
My policy would be pretty simple.

2227
02:19:08.48 --> 02:19:12.24
My policy would be kick ass.

2228
02:19:12.24 --> 02:19:13.92
That's what we would do.

2229
02:19:13.92 --> 02:19:16.80
Economic, what you're economic plan, Jaco?

2230
02:19:16.80 --> 02:19:17.92
Kick ass.

2231
02:19:17.92 --> 02:19:20.56
But what you, what would you do with this situation over here

2232
02:19:20.56 --> 02:19:22.04
in the Middle East?

2233
02:19:22.04 --> 02:19:22.52
Oh, there.

2234
02:19:22.52 --> 02:19:22.88
Oh, yeah.

2235
02:19:22.88 --> 02:19:23.84
We're going to do this.

2236
02:19:23.84 --> 02:19:25.44
We're going to kick ass.

2237
02:19:25.44 --> 02:19:29.04
What about the drug problem that we got coming in through the borders?

2238
02:19:29.04 --> 02:19:30.40
Oh, the drug cartel?

2239
02:19:30.40 --> 02:19:30.60
Yeah.

2240
02:19:30.60 --> 02:19:32.32
We're going to kick ass on that.

2241
02:19:32.32 --> 02:19:33.48
So that's my policy.

2242
02:19:33.48 --> 02:19:37.04
So this is why I probably wouldn't be the best policy.

2243
02:19:37.04 --> 02:19:38.64
That kind of like BTF.

2244
02:19:38.64 --> 02:19:39.24
Anything?

2245
02:19:39.24 --> 02:19:39.60
Yeah.

2246
02:19:39.60 --> 02:19:40.92
Yeah.

2247
02:19:40.92 --> 02:19:42.32
All right.

2248
02:19:42.32 --> 02:19:45.40
Next question.

2249
02:19:45.40 --> 02:19:50.08
Can you give us details of the mustard?

2250
02:19:50.08 --> 02:19:55.72
So for those of you who don't know, we're doing an event in San Diego, California,

2251
02:19:55.72 --> 02:19:57.24
Lake, Babin, and I.

2252
02:19:57.24 --> 02:19:59.28
And you know what, echo, which I was going to be there.

2253
02:19:59.28 --> 02:20:00.28
Maybe.

2254
02:20:00.28 --> 02:20:02.04
Gonna be there in the sidelines.

2255
02:20:02.04 --> 02:20:06.76
He's going to be signing t-shirts and cutting videos.

2256
02:20:06.76 --> 02:20:10.60
We're doing an event October, 2020, first.

2257
02:20:10.60 --> 02:20:15.88
And what it is, it is a deep dive into combat leadership.

2258
02:20:15.88 --> 02:20:17.64
What combat leadership is all about?

2259
02:20:17.64 --> 02:20:23.32
How do apply combat leadership to your business, to your life?

2260
02:20:23.32 --> 02:20:25.72
How to get out there, lead, and win?

2261
02:20:25.72 --> 02:20:31.96
The reason we're doing this is, as you know, Lake and I've been doing this gig for the past

2262
02:20:31.96 --> 02:20:34.28
five years, working with a bunch of different companies.

2263
02:20:34.28 --> 02:20:36.08
We wrote the book Extreme Ownership.

2264
02:20:36.08 --> 02:20:38.08
It's very popular.

2265
02:20:38.08 --> 02:20:40.84
We get a lot of requests.

2266
02:20:40.84 --> 02:20:43.48
And we've, you know, we've, honestly, we're in a lot of demand.

2267
02:20:43.48 --> 02:20:45.28
And people want us to come and work with a bunch of different companies.

2268
02:20:45.28 --> 02:20:46.28
We can't always do it.

2269
02:20:46.28 --> 02:20:50.88
We've actually had to raise our prices so that we could kind of slow down a little bit, slow

2270
02:20:50.88 --> 02:20:52.40
down the demand.

2271
02:20:52.40 --> 02:20:55.76
But when we're doing that, that means we're cutting a lot of people out, you know.

2272
02:20:55.76 --> 02:20:58.04
And I'm a man of the people.

2273
02:20:58.04 --> 02:21:00.04
And I want to support the work in man.

2274
02:21:00.04 --> 02:21:04.44
So how can we get something where we're regular people can come, maybe they don't

2275
02:21:04.44 --> 02:21:07.72
have, maybe their company isn't support, bring us out, or it's too expensive for us to

2276
02:21:07.72 --> 02:21:08.72
come out.

2277
02:21:08.72 --> 02:21:11.16
Well, how about you send two or three of the critical leaders out there?

2278
02:21:11.16 --> 02:21:16.56
We spend a day and a half, get deep, working, working through the things that we've learned,

2279
02:21:16.56 --> 02:21:21.64
going face to face with people and explaining things to them, how to deal with it.

2280
02:21:21.64 --> 02:21:22.92
This is not one of the things.

2281
02:21:22.92 --> 02:21:27.88
This is not going to be, this is not going to be a feel good seminar.

2282
02:21:27.88 --> 02:21:30.36
This is going to be, hey, we're here to pump you up.

2283
02:21:30.36 --> 02:21:31.96
And that's not what we're doing.

2284
02:21:31.96 --> 02:21:32.96
We're here to educate.

2285
02:21:32.96 --> 02:21:33.96
We're here to talk about leadership.

2286
02:21:33.96 --> 02:21:34.96
We're going to learn to.

2287
02:21:34.96 --> 02:21:37.60
It's going to be great to have a bunch of people in leadership positions that we

2288
02:21:37.60 --> 02:21:42.12
can talk to that we can communicate that we can learn from situations that they've been in.

2289
02:21:42.12 --> 02:21:47.68
We get, when I put out that you were coming back on the podcast, 100s and 100s questions,

2290
02:21:47.68 --> 02:21:48.96
I get thousands of questions.

2291
02:21:48.96 --> 02:21:55.04
I have on the podcast question back, it's 82 pages long.

2292
02:21:55.04 --> 02:21:57.84
82 pages worth of questions, so what I have right now.

2293
02:21:57.84 --> 02:22:01.28
I'm answering five or six questions of podcast.

2294
02:22:01.28 --> 02:22:08.16
So let's get people that want to come out, want to get face to face with life and I and learn

2295
02:22:08.16 --> 02:22:11.84
about leadership, learn what we've learned and how to apply in business life.

2296
02:22:11.84 --> 02:22:13.44
That's what we're doing with the master.

2297
02:22:13.44 --> 02:22:15.60
It's important to say to this, this is not a tour.

2298
02:22:15.60 --> 02:22:18.40
We're not going to take this from city to city to city to city.

2299
02:22:18.40 --> 02:22:21.48
This is, we're going to have one master.

2300
02:22:21.48 --> 02:22:23.48
This is an annual event.

2301
02:22:23.48 --> 02:22:27.16
Maybe at some point we'll expand in one West Coast when he's coast.

2302
02:22:27.16 --> 02:22:28.16
That's maybe.

2303
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:29.48
Right now, we're going to do it.

2304
02:22:29.48 --> 02:22:32.88
We're going to do one, one master, annual event.

2305
02:22:32.88 --> 02:22:38.24
And this is for leaders, whether you're a leader, follower, anyone who wants to better

2306
02:22:38.24 --> 02:22:43.48
themselves to dive deep into these issues of leadership, of teamwork, of extreme ownership,

2307
02:22:43.48 --> 02:22:46.32
of the laws of combat and how to apply them.

2308
02:22:46.32 --> 02:22:47.32
This is for you.

2309
02:22:47.32 --> 02:22:49.44
Come to San Diego, join us.

2310
02:22:49.44 --> 02:22:53.48
We're looking forward to diving deep into those issues, helping you solve some challenges

2311
02:22:53.48 --> 02:22:56.24
to lead and win.

2312
02:22:56.24 --> 02:22:57.24
Boom.

2313
02:22:57.24 --> 02:22:58.88
Come out to the master.

2314
02:22:58.88 --> 02:23:03.72
There's a website for it and we'll tweet it out.

2315
02:23:03.72 --> 02:23:05.16
Go to echelonfront.com.

2316
02:23:05.16 --> 02:23:06.88
You can find it on there.

2317
02:23:06.88 --> 02:23:08.72
That's our company.

2318
02:23:08.72 --> 02:23:10.000
So we can go check that out.

2319
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.28
We're looking forward to the people that want to come out and come and get some.

2320
02:23:15.28 --> 02:23:23.72
Now the reason that life was out here with me here in San Diego was for a series of events

2321
02:23:23.72 --> 02:23:33.26
to commemorate the 10 year anniversary of August 2nd, 2006, which is the day that Mark

2322
02:23:33.26 --> 02:23:44.14
Allen Lee, who was the first seal killed in Iraq, was killed in Ramadi and also the

2323
02:23:44.14 --> 02:23:53.14
day where Ryan Job, otherwise known as Biggles, was gravely wounded, shot in the face and

2324
02:23:53.14 --> 02:23:59.26
the wounds that ultimately led to his death as well.

2325
02:23:59.26 --> 02:24:09.70
This particular events were focused on Mark in an event to support a charity organization

2326
02:24:09.70 --> 02:24:19.10
that his mom runs called America's Mighty Warriors.

2327
02:24:19.10 --> 02:24:35.22
And at one of those events, I was honored to give a speech from my perspective on Mark.

2328
02:24:35.22 --> 02:24:39.66
And here it is.

2329
02:24:39.66 --> 02:24:45.10
10 years.

2330
02:24:45.10 --> 02:24:52.70
10 years is a long time, a decade.

2331
02:24:52.70 --> 02:25:01.02
And in many ways, it seems so far in the past.

2332
02:25:01.02 --> 02:25:10.86
In some ways, it doesn't seem so far away at all.

2333
02:25:10.86 --> 02:25:20.26
It isn't hard to remember being deployed in Ramadi Iraq in the summer of 2006.

2334
02:25:20.26 --> 02:25:29.78
And yes, sometimes that seems like a distant place a long time ago.

2335
02:25:29.78 --> 02:25:36.26
And yet, sometimes it feels like we were just there yesterday.

2336
02:25:36.26 --> 02:25:43.78
The sweltering heat, the dust, the danger, the crystal clear focus on our mission.

2337
02:25:43.78 --> 02:25:50.06
When we had but one purpose in our lives to close with and destroy an evil enemy bent

2338
02:25:50.06 --> 02:25:57.54
on destroying us and our way of life.

2339
02:25:57.54 --> 02:26:07.90
It doesn't take much for the mind to return there to regain that mindset to get into the combat

2340
02:26:07.90 --> 02:26:18.50
mode and remember the operations out in the city.

2341
02:26:18.50 --> 02:26:25.06
Remember the tracer rounds in the night sky, explosions shaking the earth, the weight of body

2342
02:26:25.06 --> 02:26:29.86
armor and weapons and gear on our shoulders.

2343
02:26:29.86 --> 02:26:40.50
Remember the stress and the violence and the sweat and the blood and remember the evil.

2344
02:26:40.50 --> 02:26:48.94
The pure evil that infected the city and committed savage, vile and disgusting acts of

2345
02:26:48.94 --> 02:26:58.22
mortal sin, murder, rape and torture.

2346
02:26:58.22 --> 02:27:06.62
And inside that dark world, a world ripped apart by war, a world where sometimes humanity

2347
02:27:06.62 --> 02:27:11.46
seemed all but lost.

2348
02:27:11.46 --> 02:27:18.42
That is where we got to see and experience the polar opposite, the counter to all that darkness.

2349
02:27:18.42 --> 02:27:33.46
Against that backdrop of evil, we young men, we band of brothers, we got to witness light

2350
02:27:33.46 --> 02:27:39.94
and life and love so strong that it makes the darkness fade and makes the evil power

2351
02:27:39.94 --> 02:27:44.54
and hide its wretched face.

2352
02:27:44.54 --> 02:27:49.58
So bow's down when it sees the bond we develop with the soldiers and marines we fought

2353
02:27:49.58 --> 02:27:52.46
alongside.

2354
02:27:52.46 --> 02:28:02.62
Evil cannot contest the bond we formed with our brother seals, with whom we had become so

2355
02:28:02.62 --> 02:28:09.26
close that there is no stronger force in the world, nothing more powerful, nothing more

2356
02:28:09.26 --> 02:28:16.62
meaning for the knowing that these men, these fog men that we would do anything for each

2357
02:28:16.62 --> 02:28:20.74
other.

2358
02:28:20.74 --> 02:28:28.22
We saw powerful acts of heroism and courage on an almost daily basis which reassured us

2359
02:28:28.22 --> 02:28:41.74
solemnly that good would triumph over evil and amongst all that glory there were a few

2360
02:28:41.74 --> 02:28:49.98
men, the true heroes, the ones that rose above the rest of us to symbolize and personify,

2361
02:28:49.98 --> 02:28:59.66
courage and faith and selflessness and love.

2362
02:28:59.66 --> 02:29:10.50
Mark Allen Lee was one of those rare men, one of those heroes, one of the few men my life

2363
02:29:10.50 --> 02:29:20.46
that I literally described as a saint, that is who Mark was.

2364
02:29:20.46 --> 02:29:31.50
A mighty warrior whose ferocity and combat was perfectly balanced by faith and humor and compassion.

2365
02:29:31.50 --> 02:29:38.78
A man that left his mark on everyone that he met, a mark of happiness, then positivity,

2366
02:29:38.78 --> 02:29:50.78
and of humility and of joy, a man whose love for his family and friends was so unbounded

2367
02:29:50.78 --> 02:30:02.78
and so limitless that you could actually feel it emanating from his heart.

2368
02:30:02.78 --> 02:30:24.46
And now he has left his mark on the world, Mark Lee, Mark Allen Lee, when faced with fear,

2369
02:30:24.46 --> 02:30:37.14
who else could bring a smile, when faced with sadness, who else could bring laughter,

2370
02:30:37.14 --> 02:30:49.30
when faced with hate, who else could bring love, and when faced with death, who else could

2371
02:30:49.30 --> 02:30:58.10
stand and say, take me, Lord, not my brothers, I will be there shield now from death, take

2372
02:30:58.10 --> 02:31:07.30
me and let them live on.

2373
02:31:07.30 --> 02:31:22.42
And that is what Mark did, full of youth and energy and courage and humor and full of love.

2374
02:31:22.42 --> 02:31:32.74
He stood, he stood against evil and he stood against death and he gave his life for his

2375
02:31:32.74 --> 02:31:35.38
brothers.

2376
02:31:35.38 --> 02:31:59.26
And for our freedom on August 2nd, 2006 in our Ramadi Iraq, 10 years ago, 10 years ago,

2377
02:31:59.26 --> 02:32:12.78
and in those 10 years, think of all that has happened in our lives, big events like

2378
02:32:12.78 --> 02:32:27.22
marriages, children born, birthdays, new houses, new jobs, new careers, and small events,

2379
02:32:27.22 --> 02:32:36.42
morning surf session, lunch with your buddies, and weekend in the mountains, a cold

2380
02:32:36.42 --> 02:33:05.98
ice tea on a hot summer's day, smile, a laugh, life, joy, happiness, and every moment of

2381
02:33:05.98 --> 02:33:23.14
that happiness is a gift, a gift given to us by Mark who sacrificed everything for us,

2382
02:33:23.14 --> 02:33:33.98
who gave up his own precious smile so we could all have ours.

2383
02:33:33.98 --> 02:33:41.82
Now I can tell you without a shred of doubt that on this day, Mark would not want tears,

2384
02:33:41.82 --> 02:33:51.66
he would not want sadness, he would not want sorrow, he would want smiles and laughter

2385
02:33:51.66 --> 02:34:05.34
and joy because that was his gift to us, every smile, every laugh, every ounce of life

2386
02:34:05.34 --> 02:34:33.42
and love is all a gift from a warrior, a friend, a comedian, a son, a brother, a hero, a saint,

2387
02:34:33.42 --> 02:34:45.10
and what do we owe Mark?

2388
02:34:45.10 --> 02:34:53.22
For Mark, each and every one of us must relish the gift that he gave to us and cherish

2389
02:34:53.22 --> 02:35:13.22
each and every day while remembering the incredible man that gave us this gift of life

2390
02:35:13.22 --> 02:35:27.14
and to the seals that are listening, the frogmen, you oh Mark, what we owe all our fallen

2391
02:35:27.14 --> 02:35:36.34
brothers, the grave commitment to carry the fire, to hold the torch and hold it high,

2392
02:35:36.34 --> 02:35:46.34
to take the fight to the enemy, every chance you get without mercy and without remorse

2393
02:35:46.34 --> 02:35:59.50
until they are vanquished and there is peace.

2394
02:35:59.50 --> 02:36:02.18
Thank you Mark.

2395
02:36:02.18 --> 02:36:06.62
We will never forget you.

2396
02:36:06.62 --> 02:36:25.74
God bless Mark's family, God bless the teams, God bless America and God bless Mark Alan Lee.

2397
02:36:25.74 --> 02:36:34.54
When I think that's all we've got for the night and I want to thank everybody that's

2398
02:36:34.54 --> 02:36:35.90
out there.

2399
02:36:35.90 --> 02:36:39.90
That's listening.

2400
02:36:39.90 --> 02:36:46.38
Thank you for remembering.

2401
02:36:46.38 --> 02:36:56.10
And that's one of the things that we do here remember.

2402
02:36:56.10 --> 02:37:00.54
I want to thank Lay for coming on.

2403
02:37:00.54 --> 02:37:12.66
We've been tied into so many things and you are pointing that out to me the other day,

2404
02:37:12.66 --> 02:37:23.78
we've been tied into so many different things and so many far reaching stories that we've

2405
02:37:23.78 --> 02:37:26.30
been a part of.

2406
02:37:26.30 --> 02:37:34.30
And I thank you for coming on here and helping to share some of these stories with me

2407
02:37:34.30 --> 02:37:36.30
for everyone to hear.

2408
02:37:36.30 --> 02:37:38.30
Thanks for having me.

2409
02:37:38.30 --> 02:37:43.58
I have one can remember.

2410
02:37:43.58 --> 02:37:48.86
Those of you that are out there and you want to keep listening and you want to keep

2411
02:37:48.86 --> 02:37:53.74
remembering.

2412
02:37:53.74 --> 02:37:54.74
Echo.

2413
02:37:54.74 --> 02:37:57.74
Can they support this?

2414
02:37:57.74 --> 02:37:59.74
I'll be out here.

2415
02:37:59.74 --> 02:38:00.74
Red cluster.

2416
02:38:00.74 --> 02:38:02.74
Red star cluster.

2417
02:38:02.74 --> 02:38:04.98
Yeah, thanks for coming on, Lee.

2418
02:38:04.98 --> 02:38:08.38
That's right, man.

2419
02:38:08.38 --> 02:38:15.18
We didn't talk much about working out or that kind of stuff but if you're into supplements,

2420
02:38:15.18 --> 02:38:20.18
even if you're not into supplements, my opinion, going on a dot com slash jockel, get on

2421
02:38:20.18 --> 02:38:21.18
its supplements.

2422
02:38:21.18 --> 02:38:23.02
That'll help you out a lot.

2423
02:38:23.02 --> 02:38:24.02
10% off.

2424
02:38:24.02 --> 02:38:29.30
So we said a bunch of times but I can't, I can't say enough really as far as benefits.

2425
02:38:29.30 --> 02:38:31.66
It'll put you head for sure.

2426
02:38:31.66 --> 02:38:34.10
So yeah, get 10% off that.

2427
02:38:34.10 --> 02:38:41.54
If you want to support with the Amazon situation, the one where you go to the website,

2428
02:38:41.54 --> 02:38:42.54
click on the Amazon link.

2429
02:38:42.54 --> 02:38:43.54
You don't be for you.

2430
02:38:43.54 --> 02:38:45.70
You're shopping.

2431
02:38:45.70 --> 02:38:47.26
That's a good way to do it.

2432
02:38:47.26 --> 02:38:51.86
If you have our time remembering, we have the Trooper tool, which is good.

2433
02:38:51.86 --> 02:38:52.86
Brady.

2434
02:38:52.86 --> 02:38:53.86
Brady, boy.

2435
02:38:53.86 --> 02:38:56.26
Came through on the other one.

2436
02:38:56.26 --> 02:38:57.26
It's a thing.

2437
02:38:57.26 --> 02:38:58.26
There's a link on the website.

2438
02:38:58.26 --> 02:38:59.26
It's called the Trooper tool.

2439
02:38:59.26 --> 02:39:00.26
You click on it.

2440
02:39:00.26 --> 02:39:01.26
It takes you to the page.

2441
02:39:01.26 --> 02:39:02.26
You click on it.

2442
02:39:02.26 --> 02:39:03.26
You say yes.

2443
02:39:03.26 --> 02:39:04.26
It's a little thing.

2444
02:39:04.26 --> 02:39:10.26
So it automatically directs you to Amazon.

2445
02:39:10.26 --> 02:39:11.90
It adds the affiliate links.

2446
02:39:11.90 --> 02:39:14.62
So you support the podcast.

2447
02:39:14.62 --> 02:39:17.02
You don't have to go through the website anymore.

2448
02:39:17.02 --> 02:39:19.02
That's a good one.

2449
02:39:19.02 --> 02:39:20.78
Yeah, and subscribe to the podcast on iTunes.

2450
02:39:20.78 --> 02:39:22.02
That's a good one.

2451
02:39:22.02 --> 02:39:24.66
And there's other places to subscribe to it.

2452
02:39:24.66 --> 02:39:25.66
Yeah.

2453
02:39:25.66 --> 02:39:26.66
Sure.

2454
02:39:26.66 --> 02:39:27.66
YouTube.

2455
02:39:27.66 --> 02:39:28.66
Google Play, by the way.

2456
02:39:28.66 --> 02:39:29.66
Yeah.

2457
02:39:29.66 --> 02:39:30.66
And Stitcher to turn to that.

2458
02:39:30.66 --> 02:39:32.66
I think it's the main one.

2459
02:39:32.66 --> 02:39:35.06
Hey man, Stitcher's dope as well.

2460
02:39:35.06 --> 02:39:36.06
Google Play too.

2461
02:39:36.06 --> 02:39:37.06
It's on there.

2462
02:39:37.06 --> 02:39:38.06
So yeah.

2463
02:39:38.06 --> 02:39:39.22
And go to the YouTube channel.

2464
02:39:39.22 --> 02:39:42.06
I was going to release a video today.

2465
02:39:42.06 --> 02:39:45.74
It was like, I'll take whatever.

2466
02:39:45.74 --> 02:39:47.78
But what?

2467
02:39:47.78 --> 02:39:48.78
You're protesting.

2468
02:39:48.78 --> 02:39:49.78
I still have to fire it up.

2469
02:39:49.78 --> 02:39:50.78
Yeah, man.

2470
02:39:50.78 --> 02:39:52.26
Let's do fire it up with other stuff.

2471
02:39:52.26 --> 02:39:53.26
I'll post it tonight.

2472
02:39:53.26 --> 02:39:54.26
Let me get some.

2473
02:39:54.26 --> 02:39:56.18
So it's like, what is it?

2474
02:39:56.18 --> 02:39:57.18
I'll take video.

2475
02:39:57.18 --> 02:40:00.66
Yeah, it's like, one was the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

2476
02:40:00.66 --> 02:40:05.42
See what makes me nervous about this is I believe in decentralized command.

2477
02:40:05.42 --> 02:40:06.42
All right.

2478
02:40:06.42 --> 02:40:08.06
They can attest to that right.

2479
02:40:08.06 --> 02:40:09.06
Sure.

2480
02:40:09.06 --> 02:40:10.06
I don't believe in decentralized command.

2481
02:40:10.06 --> 02:40:11.06
Sure.

2482
02:40:11.06 --> 02:40:12.06
But now I'm starting to deal with it.

2483
02:40:12.06 --> 02:40:13.26
May possible trust scenario.

2484
02:40:13.26 --> 02:40:14.90
You're requires trust and confidence.

2485
02:40:14.90 --> 02:40:15.90
Well, sure.

2486
02:40:15.90 --> 02:40:16.90
Yeah.

2487
02:40:16.90 --> 02:40:19.90
What if my brother echo Charles haven't seen it.

2488
02:40:19.90 --> 02:40:20.90
Yep.

2489
02:40:20.90 --> 02:40:22.90
So this is the unauthorized outtakes.

2490
02:40:22.90 --> 02:40:23.90
Yeah.

2491
02:40:23.90 --> 02:40:24.90
So here.

2492
02:40:24.90 --> 02:40:27.90
And we're going to, we're going to ease into this whole thing.

2493
02:40:27.90 --> 02:40:29.38
So there's one.

2494
02:40:29.38 --> 02:40:33.62
And this is just off the top man where I was telling you about my, my children's book idea.

2495
02:40:33.62 --> 02:40:34.62
Oh, okay.

2496
02:40:34.62 --> 02:40:35.14
Yeah.

2497
02:40:35.14 --> 02:40:36.62
You're going to make, okay.

2498
02:40:36.62 --> 02:40:37.62
It's a good idea.

2499
02:40:37.62 --> 02:40:38.62
Okay.

2500
02:40:38.62 --> 02:40:39.42
That was the fish in the water.

2501
02:40:39.42 --> 02:40:42.06
I actually remember right now, which is hitting me, right?

2502
02:40:42.06 --> 02:40:43.30
I'm okay with it.

2503
02:40:43.30 --> 02:40:47.50
I was just, uh, I was looking to certain that he might have, uh, you know, a rendition

2504
02:40:47.50 --> 02:40:49.62
of me and you singing, we are the world.

2505
02:40:49.62 --> 02:40:50.62
Yes.

2506
02:40:50.62 --> 02:40:51.62
Yes.

2507
02:40:51.62 --> 02:40:52.62
Which I don't think we hit record yet.

2508
02:40:52.62 --> 02:40:53.62
We don't want that.

2509
02:40:53.62 --> 02:40:54.62
We don't want that.

2510
02:40:54.62 --> 02:40:55.62
I don't know if I win.

2511
02:40:55.62 --> 02:40:58.86
When Laf and I were put the headphones on and the mics in front of us and we're

2512
02:40:58.86 --> 02:41:02.18
standing here looking at each other and it felt very much like if you were live during

2513
02:41:02.18 --> 02:41:05.26
the 80s, he did that we are the world video.

2514
02:41:05.26 --> 02:41:08.94
And for some reason that just hit us both at the same time, we busted out.

2515
02:41:08.94 --> 02:41:09.94
We are the world.

2516
02:41:09.94 --> 02:41:10.94
Markling them, bro.

2517
02:41:10.94 --> 02:41:12.94
And she won a good beat.

2518
02:41:12.94 --> 02:41:15.62
I was proud for sure.

2519
02:41:15.62 --> 02:41:16.62
And yeah.

2520
02:41:16.62 --> 02:41:21.78
So the YouTube videos I told you last time, echo needs motivation.

2521
02:41:21.78 --> 02:41:25.30
He's, you know, he's, he's just a laid back guy.

2522
02:41:25.30 --> 02:41:30.42
So we need to motivate him and he, that his excuse was, well, you know, that I'm going to

2523
02:41:30.42 --> 02:41:33.94
describe your own, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2524
02:41:33.94 --> 02:41:35.38
That doesn't sound like a stream ownership.

2525
02:41:35.38 --> 02:41:36.38
Why should I watch that?

2526
02:41:36.38 --> 02:41:37.38
I've never said that.

2527
02:41:37.38 --> 02:41:38.38
That's the thing.

2528
02:41:38.38 --> 02:41:39.38
All right.

2529
02:41:39.38 --> 02:41:40.38
So cool.

2530
02:41:40.38 --> 02:41:41.38
Nothing to get too technical.

2531
02:41:41.38 --> 02:41:42.74
It's not, I don't need motivation.

2532
02:41:42.74 --> 02:41:43.74
They need incentive.

2533
02:41:43.74 --> 02:41:45.74
Oh, they'll take their, they're different.

2534
02:41:45.74 --> 02:41:46.74
Okay.

2535
02:41:46.74 --> 02:41:47.74
I don't want to get into a big thing.

2536
02:41:47.74 --> 02:41:48.74
Yeah.

2537
02:41:48.74 --> 02:41:49.74
Yeah.

2538
02:41:49.74 --> 02:41:50.74
I don't want to either.

2539
02:41:50.74 --> 02:41:51.74
Awesome.

2540
02:41:51.74 --> 02:41:53.74
So that's it.

2541
02:41:53.74 --> 02:41:54.74
Thank you.

2542
02:41:54.74 --> 02:41:55.98
The jockel store is a good one.

2543
02:41:55.98 --> 02:41:58.98
You know, get a shirt if you like those, um, and a bumper sticker.

2544
02:41:58.98 --> 02:41:59.98
Oh, whatever.

2545
02:41:59.98 --> 02:42:03.50
If you like those, I forgot about the t-shirts and the store, the jockel store.

2546
02:42:03.50 --> 02:42:04.82
Yeah, that's a little bit.

2547
02:42:04.82 --> 02:42:09.06
And if you like them, yeah, if you don't like them, don't get them.

2548
02:42:09.06 --> 02:42:10.06
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2549
02:42:10.06 --> 02:42:11.06
Oh, yeah.

2550
02:42:11.06 --> 02:42:12.06
I've seen a lot of those on Twitter.

2551
02:42:12.06 --> 02:42:13.06
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2552
02:42:13.06 --> 02:42:14.06
Awesome.

2553
02:42:14.06 --> 02:42:15.06
We do dig that.

2554
02:42:15.06 --> 02:42:19.54
But I'll tell you, if, I should we just say to stop asking us for like a donation

2555
02:42:19.54 --> 02:42:20.54
page.

2556
02:42:20.54 --> 02:42:22.30
No, we shouldn't say that.

2557
02:42:22.30 --> 02:42:23.30
Okay.

2558
02:42:23.30 --> 02:42:25.02
And with it, don't ask me.

2559
02:42:25.02 --> 02:42:26.02
Patreon, Patreon, Patreon.

2560
02:42:26.02 --> 02:42:27.02
Patreon.

2561
02:42:27.02 --> 02:42:28.02
Patreon.

2562
02:42:28.02 --> 02:42:29.02
We're not going to do it.

2563
02:42:29.02 --> 02:42:30.02
Yeah, probably not going to do it.

2564
02:42:30.02 --> 02:42:31.74
If you want to donate, you can donate paper.

2565
02:42:31.74 --> 02:42:33.70
Yeah, if you can, that's good.

2566
02:42:33.70 --> 02:42:34.70
That's cool.

2567
02:42:34.70 --> 02:42:36.66
It is cool to see those because it's like 434.

2568
02:42:36.66 --> 02:42:37.66
Yeah.

2569
02:42:37.66 --> 02:42:39.26
Yeah, because that's that's the cool.

2570
02:42:39.26 --> 02:42:40.54
That's what the cool kids do.

2571
02:42:40.54 --> 02:42:45.34
They donate $4.34 a month to keep them up in a gauge.

2572
02:42:45.34 --> 02:42:46.82
Up before the enemy.

2573
02:42:46.82 --> 02:42:48.62
Yeah, that is cool.

2574
02:42:48.62 --> 02:42:50.06
Yeah, by the way, it's sleep deprivation.

2575
02:42:50.06 --> 02:42:51.06
I'm on it right now.

2576
02:42:51.06 --> 02:42:55.26
Dave and I were out late last night and we were up very early this morning to work out

2577
02:42:55.26 --> 02:42:56.26
and then go surfing.

2578
02:42:56.26 --> 02:42:57.26
That's right.

2579
02:42:57.26 --> 02:42:58.26
We were on.

2580
02:42:58.26 --> 02:42:59.26
We were work and play.

2581
02:42:59.26 --> 02:43:00.26
All right.

2582
02:43:00.26 --> 02:43:02.26
This is a pleasure to say about that.

2583
02:43:02.26 --> 02:43:03.26
Good.

2584
02:43:03.26 --> 02:43:04.26
Exactly.

2585
02:43:04.26 --> 02:43:05.26
Awesome.

2586
02:43:05.26 --> 02:43:06.26
Awesome.

2587
02:43:06.26 --> 02:43:07.26
Yeah, those are the ways.

2588
02:43:07.26 --> 02:43:08.26
Okay, good.

2589
02:43:08.26 --> 02:43:15.06
And then also, if you want, you don't believe in not this guy sitting here with me,

2590
02:43:15.06 --> 02:43:16.06
Dave Baben.

2591
02:43:16.06 --> 02:43:17.06
Yeah.

2592
02:43:17.06 --> 02:43:20.10
I know E and I might not look like the smartest people in the world.

2593
02:43:20.10 --> 02:43:23.74
We might actually not be this smart as people know it, but we did write a book.

2594
02:43:23.74 --> 02:43:28.30
People, people look at me and probably think I can't spell my name or read much less

2595
02:43:28.30 --> 02:43:29.30
write a book.

2596
02:43:29.30 --> 02:43:31.14
But we did write a book.

2597
02:43:31.14 --> 02:43:32.54
The books continue to do really well.

2598
02:43:32.54 --> 02:43:37.66
And if you're interested in the book, if you're interested in the concepts and

2599
02:43:37.66 --> 02:43:42.10
Jockel talks about the stuff that we just talked about and we talked about in episode 11 of

2600
02:43:42.10 --> 02:43:46.38
the Jockel podcast, get the book and dive into that stuff, deep talk about extreme

2601
02:43:46.38 --> 02:43:47.38
ownership.

2602
02:43:47.38 --> 02:43:49.34
Talk about the laws of combat and how they apply.

2603
02:43:49.34 --> 02:43:50.34
We use combat scenarios.

2604
02:43:50.34 --> 02:43:54.82
We talk about the principle and we talk about how to apply to different businesses and

2605
02:43:54.82 --> 02:43:57.18
organizations that we work with over the years.

2606
02:43:57.18 --> 02:44:04.06
It's something that for us, our mission was to write a book that could be useful for leaders

2607
02:44:04.06 --> 02:44:05.06
as a reference.

2608
02:44:05.06 --> 02:44:11.42
A good read that people can get into and have some exciting stores that are applicable.

2609
02:44:11.42 --> 02:44:18.94
But also is a useful reference for leaders to highlight underlying tab refer to regularly

2610
02:44:18.94 --> 02:44:24.70
you know, dog ear pages and as we've received that kind of feedback and people post messages

2611
02:44:24.70 --> 02:44:30.06
on social media about their books and the dog ear pages and the tabs or the highlights.

2612
02:44:30.06 --> 02:44:35.26
And the feedback we've received has been tremendous and if we've done that and accomplished

2613
02:44:35.26 --> 02:44:39.26
that for those leaders, as that useful reference that has helped them be better leaders,

2614
02:44:39.26 --> 02:44:44.26
better followers, better team members, accomplish their mission when then we've succeeded

2615
02:44:44.26 --> 02:44:45.26
in our mission.

2616
02:44:45.26 --> 02:44:47.02
I'll tell you what fires me up too.

2617
02:44:47.02 --> 02:44:49.34
I love seeing that.

2618
02:44:49.34 --> 02:44:53.06
I love seeing when people are like, they're showing a, because I post pictures of the books

2619
02:44:53.06 --> 02:44:57.78
that I do on the podcast and they're all, they're all notes and they're all that stuff

2620
02:44:57.78 --> 02:44:58.78
because I'm getting ready.

2621
02:44:58.78 --> 02:44:59.78
I dive deep.

2622
02:44:59.78 --> 02:45:03.18
And so people do that to our book and like you said, that's awesome.

2623
02:45:03.18 --> 02:45:07.10
And we love signing books that have massive, the other cool thing.

2624
02:45:07.10 --> 02:45:08.26
There's two other cool things.

2625
02:45:08.26 --> 02:45:09.26
They're kind of related.

2626
02:45:09.26 --> 02:45:14.06
One of them is when people send a picture of a stack of books and they're like issuing

2627
02:45:14.06 --> 02:45:17.42
these to my teams today, we're going to get it on that's awesome.

2628
02:45:17.42 --> 02:45:19.06
And there's something else that happens.

2629
02:45:19.06 --> 02:45:21.18
That's a little bit.

2630
02:45:21.18 --> 02:45:23.26
It might be more awesome.

2631
02:45:23.26 --> 02:45:26.02
It might be the same awesome, but it's definitely awesome.

2632
02:45:26.02 --> 02:45:29.02
And that's when they're, when they're giving the book to their boss.

2633
02:45:29.02 --> 02:45:30.02
Right?

2634
02:45:30.02 --> 02:45:33.38
And there's, and somebody, somebody hit us up the other day and like, how do I give this book

2635
02:45:33.38 --> 02:45:37.78
to my boss and I think, lay for out, you know, something along lines of, hey, it's a great,

2636
02:45:37.78 --> 02:45:40.98
it's a great thing to give to your boss.

2637
02:45:40.98 --> 02:45:44.02
And when you do it, say, hey man, I learn, you know, you don't want to say, you're

2638
02:45:44.02 --> 02:45:50.26
thinking, the thing you don't want to do is say, you need to get some extreme ownership.

2639
02:45:50.26 --> 02:45:52.22
So I'm giving this to you as a hint.

2640
02:45:52.22 --> 02:45:56.98
No, what you want to say is, I got so much out of this book and I'm going to turn, you know,

2641
02:45:56.98 --> 02:45:59.30
I look forward to applying what I learned.

2642
02:45:59.30 --> 02:46:02.54
I just want, if you see a change in attitude, I want you to know where it's coming from.

2643
02:46:02.54 --> 02:46:03.74
Do something like that.

2644
02:46:03.74 --> 02:46:04.74
Be tactical.

2645
02:46:04.74 --> 02:46:11.02
Well, interestingly enough, ironically, looking at someone and saying, you need extreme ownership

2646
02:46:11.02 --> 02:46:12.66
is not extreme ownership, right?

2647
02:46:12.66 --> 02:46:16.10
Because extreme ownership is about you and you got to control that relationship.

2648
02:46:16.10 --> 02:46:17.10
You got to build that relationship.

2649
02:46:17.10 --> 02:46:21.22
So if you feel like the boss needs a luxury ownership, then you got to own that.

2650
02:46:21.22 --> 02:46:23.90
And you get to lead up the chain of command, which is one of the chapters you really

2651
02:46:23.90 --> 02:46:24.90
know about.

2652
02:46:24.90 --> 02:46:26.46
And it's cool to, you know, we're out of here.

2653
02:46:26.46 --> 02:46:31.70
Obviously, this weekend, we saw a lot of our, of our, of our, seal buddies and it's interesting

2654
02:46:31.70 --> 02:46:35.10
we always have an conversation with, I think there's three or four of us saying the circle,

2655
02:46:35.10 --> 02:46:40.46
but they were talking about the book and, you know, it's guys that were junior to us at

2656
02:46:40.46 --> 02:46:45.50
the time and now they're saying, hey, you know, this is awesome.

2657
02:46:45.50 --> 02:46:46.70
I'm getting a lot out of it.

2658
02:46:46.70 --> 02:46:52.70
And then guys that are senior to us with the, I wish I would add this book.

2659
02:46:52.70 --> 02:46:53.90
And you know what I'd say?

2660
02:46:53.90 --> 02:46:55.46
I do too.

2661
02:46:55.46 --> 02:46:56.46
I do too.

2662
02:46:56.46 --> 02:46:57.14
I wish I would have this book.

2663
02:46:57.14 --> 02:47:04.74
I mean, it's just like a little step up to just know and be able to read him.

2664
02:47:04.74 --> 02:47:06.02
It just gives you that insight.

2665
02:47:06.02 --> 02:47:07.02
And it's awesome.

2666
02:47:07.02 --> 02:47:10.14
We appreciate, appreciate that.

2667
02:47:10.14 --> 02:47:13.90
Appreciate everyone giving us the solid feedback.

2668
02:47:13.90 --> 02:47:14.90
Killer.

2669
02:47:14.90 --> 02:47:17.50
And you got anything else, Dave?

2670
02:47:17.50 --> 02:47:18.50
That's all I got.

2671
02:47:18.50 --> 02:47:19.50
Thanks for having me on.

2672
02:47:19.50 --> 02:47:20.70
Gonna be on with you guys again.

2673
02:47:20.70 --> 02:47:21.70
Always.

2674
02:47:21.70 --> 02:47:24.02
Oh, looking forward to the next time.

2675
02:47:24.02 --> 02:47:26.34
Echo Charles closing comments.

2676
02:47:26.34 --> 02:47:27.34
Point go.

2677
02:47:27.34 --> 02:47:28.34
No, Plinkle.

2678
02:47:28.34 --> 02:47:31.30
Leaf does something like Batman.

2679
02:47:31.30 --> 02:47:32.30
That's all.

2680
02:47:32.30 --> 02:47:33.46
The Texas Batman.

2681
02:47:33.46 --> 02:47:37.90
Texas Batman.

2682
02:47:37.90 --> 02:47:39.02
I actually never heard that.

2683
02:47:39.02 --> 02:47:41.50
I never heard that until the audio book.

2684
02:47:41.50 --> 02:47:42.90
You never heard Texas Batman.

2685
02:47:42.90 --> 02:47:45.10
Yeah, Jocelyn actually, we read the audio book.

2686
02:47:45.10 --> 02:47:47.26
James Earl Jones wasn't available.

2687
02:47:47.26 --> 02:47:49.10
So we read it ourselves.

2688
02:47:49.10 --> 02:47:51.74
I would have, I would have given it up for if James Earl Jones had,

2689
02:47:51.74 --> 02:47:52.74
I might have done that.

2690
02:47:52.74 --> 02:47:53.74
But we read it ourselves.

2691
02:47:53.74 --> 02:47:56.10
And that's the first time I started hearing that people were like,

2692
02:47:56.10 --> 02:47:57.82
you sound like, Texas Batman.

2693
02:47:57.82 --> 02:47:58.90
So they're Batman.

2694
02:47:58.90 --> 02:48:00.70
I was like, what are you talking about?

2695
02:48:00.70 --> 02:48:02.22
You know, I don't even, I don't even, I don't even,

2696
02:48:02.22 --> 02:48:04.22
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even, I don't even, I don't even.

2697
02:48:04.22 --> 02:48:06.22
I don't even, I don't even, I don't even, I don't even.

2698
02:48:06.22 --> 02:48:10.22
You know what, one too many immediate action drills over the years,

2699
02:48:10.22 --> 02:48:12.54
I guess, screaming out some commands.

2700
02:48:12.54 --> 02:48:14.30
Or maybe it was when I lost my cool.

2701
02:48:14.30 --> 02:48:15.30
We talked about.

2702
02:48:15.30 --> 02:48:16.34
I should have done less of that.

2703
02:48:16.34 --> 02:48:18.38
Blue, you've always out awesome.

2704
02:48:18.38 --> 02:48:23.10
Well, as always, if anybody out there wants to continue this conversation,

2705
02:48:23.10 --> 02:48:25.70
we'll ever all up on the inner webs.

2706
02:48:25.70 --> 02:48:32.18
Twitter, the Facebookie, Instagram, Echo is at Echo Charles.

2707
02:48:32.18 --> 02:48:37.98
Charles' life is at Lave Babin and I am at Jocca Willink.

2708
02:48:37.98 --> 02:48:43.34
And to all those folks out there, you need to uniform.

2709
02:48:43.34 --> 02:48:51.02
Those in the military on the front lines in the war against evil.

2710
02:48:51.02 --> 02:49:00.90
Those police on the thin blue line, fighting criminals and terror here at home and the firefighters

2711
02:49:00.90 --> 02:49:08.14
that run towards the danger to protect us in our homes.

2712
02:49:08.14 --> 02:49:12.90
Thanks to you all for everything that you do.

2713
02:49:12.90 --> 02:49:20.70
And arrested the troopers out there in the world, moving forward, stepping up, taking

2714
02:49:20.70 --> 02:49:29.22
charge in business, in education, in healthcare, buying, selling, building, creating, making

2715
02:49:29.22 --> 02:49:34.66
the most of this gift.

2716
02:49:34.66 --> 02:49:37.42
Thanks for listening.

2717
02:49:37.42 --> 02:49:40.02
Thanks for spreading the word.

2718
02:49:40.02 --> 02:49:44.74
And thanks for grabbing life by the horns.

2719
02:49:44.74 --> 02:49:53.34
Going out there aggressively every day and getting after it.

2720
02:49:53.34 --> 02:50:02.14
So until next time, this is Lave, Echo and Jocco.

2721
02:50:02.14 --> 02:50:30.64
You're different.
