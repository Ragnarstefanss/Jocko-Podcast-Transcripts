00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.24
This is Jockel podcast number 239 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening

2
00:00:06.24 --> 00:00:10.64
Eko good evening and also joining us tonight is Dave Burke good evening

3
00:00:10.64 --> 00:00:15.84
Dave good evening. So last podcast we went through the woozy

4
00:00:16.96 --> 00:00:20.48
Which you did some you did some research and we did not

5
00:00:21.56 --> 00:00:23.52
Come up with the meaning of the word

6
00:00:23.52 --> 00:00:30.40
woozy other than room okay so woozy by woochy from ancient China

7
00:00:30.40 --> 00:00:31.76
a lot of

8
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:37.76
solid leadership lessons in there and I was thinking about these leadership principles

9
00:00:39.84 --> 00:00:42.32
and how leadership principles are not supposed to change

10
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:46.72
Right that's kind of you know I say oh you know leadership principles stay the same

11
00:00:46.72 --> 00:00:54.80
and when you read through the woozy you start to get some supporting evidence to that

12
00:00:54.80 --> 00:00:58.08
because he's talking about the fact that you need to be beloved but never

13
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:02.80
and you need to treat people well and treat them with respect and take care of your people

14
00:01:03.92 --> 00:01:08.08
which is all things that you know I talk about we all talk about

15
00:01:09.92 --> 00:01:12.56
but then in the woozy it also says

16
00:01:12.56 --> 00:01:16.08
to execute anyone that disobeyes your orders

17
00:01:18.48 --> 00:01:24.16
so so that leads you to think well maybe some principles have changed and you know I used to

18
00:01:24.16 --> 00:01:31.36
actually have a rationalization for this or an excuse for this and what I would say is

19
00:01:31.36 --> 00:01:36.16
there's there's a difference in leadership when you're leading conscripts

20
00:01:36.16 --> 00:01:45.36
instead of volunteers and so as leadership moved away from or military leadership and that

21
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:48.40
by the way when you go back in time it's not just military leadership because what are the

22
00:01:48.40 --> 00:01:52.80
people the people are surfs and peasants and they're being led by these kings

23
00:01:53.76 --> 00:02:01.76
with divine power so but as time went by it's like okay so that's why the leadership principle

24
00:02:01.76 --> 00:02:06.08
might not really fit maybe that's why it changed but then I started thinking about that

25
00:02:06.08 --> 00:02:13.44
what if you go ahead and actually let those things play out right and actually

26
00:02:14.08 --> 00:02:19.04
that question has been answered right that's what history is and what happens is

27
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:24.40
if you're executing people if you're not treating people the right way as leaders what happens

28
00:02:24.40 --> 00:02:32.08
eventually what do you get you get a revolution you get people to come after you and take you

29
00:02:32.08 --> 00:02:38.16
out of power and look just like we talk about you can get people on board for a little while right

30
00:02:38.16 --> 00:02:44.32
if I have you know 5,000 soldiers and they see me execute two people that didn't follow my orders

31
00:02:44.32 --> 00:02:50.32
they're going to follow my orders for a little while right maybe for a long time maybe since

32
00:02:50.32 --> 00:02:54.56
that extremely measure maybe they'll follow my orders for a year they'll just live in fear

33
00:02:54.56 --> 00:03:01.20
but when that opportunity arrives for them to step up and take that power away from you they're

34
00:03:01.20 --> 00:03:07.12
going to do it so what we see play out and then the other side so now we go to the

35
00:03:08.16 --> 00:03:14.48
side of okay so I'm going to take care of my people that's what I'm going to do but just like we say

36
00:03:15.36 --> 00:03:18.80
that doesn't mean we caught a lot of people because if we caught a lot of people then they're

37
00:03:19.84 --> 00:03:28.48
they're soft and they destroy themselves they they fall apart so and we see that play out

38
00:03:28.48 --> 00:03:37.68
in the world when a society gets too soft they can no longer survive so even in ancient times

39
00:03:37.68 --> 00:03:43.92
with conscripts and peasants and serves and slaves if you let things play out the leadership

40
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:50.48
principles still actually apply and and then I started thinking about tactics which this is

41
00:03:50.48 --> 00:03:57.84
another thing that I used to sort of I used to I used to sort of say the same thing about tactics

42
00:03:57.84 --> 00:04:05.28
which is hey you know the principles on the battlefield they don't change until you go before

43
00:04:05.28 --> 00:04:11.52
the machine gun right or the at least the gun right because that's that's where you start to talk

44
00:04:11.52 --> 00:04:17.92
about covered move and that's where it really plays into plays into how you're going to fight

45
00:04:17.92 --> 00:04:26.24
but then if you adjust your perspective a little bit if we're fighting with spears and we're

46
00:04:26.24 --> 00:04:32.96
in a failanks guess what I've got my shield I'm holding my shield up it protects the left

47
00:04:32.96 --> 00:04:39.36
part of my body and it protects the right part of the person to my left and I'm being protected

48
00:04:39.36 --> 00:04:44.64
covered by the person on my right and what we're going to do is cover for each other as we advance

49
00:04:44.64 --> 00:04:51.52
with the failanks so we still have to look out for each other teamwork still absolutely applies

50
00:04:51.52 --> 00:05:01.60
and then I was thinking about the fact that you know here's a here's a military principle

51
00:05:02.24 --> 00:05:07.20
that I'm just trying to think of things that don't apply right well in modern combat

52
00:05:07.20 --> 00:05:12.48
we follow rule of dispersion meaning we want to be spread apart we don't want to be too close together

53
00:05:13.04 --> 00:05:17.28
so that's obviously completely contrary to the idea of being in a failanks where we're

54
00:05:17.28 --> 00:05:20.96
going to get as close to weekend we're going to keep tight when we move forward but if you change

55
00:05:20.96 --> 00:05:28.16
your perspective just a little bit you and this is this is one of those doctrinal terms that I was

56
00:05:28.16 --> 00:05:33.44
able to uncover because of what I used to tell guys is hey if you're alone on the battlefield

57
00:05:33.44 --> 00:05:39.04
you're going to die if you get too far away from your element the other element you can't support

58
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:44.64
each other that's what cover move is so if you're too far away you can't support each other and you

59
00:05:44.64 --> 00:05:51.20
will get killed because if we're alone we die and that that doctrinal term that when I found it

60
00:05:52.32 --> 00:05:57.20
I used to get these beautiful satisfaction satisfactory moments in my life where I would have

61
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:03.52
an idea and then I would see that it already existed and and that doctrinal term that I would then

62
00:06:03.52 --> 00:06:09.92
walk around as if I knew it you know as if it was just you know but it's called supporting distance

63
00:06:09.92 --> 00:06:18.96
so you Dave shouldn't take your squad beyond where my range the web the range of my weapons

64
00:06:18.96 --> 00:06:22.64
and then when you start to talk about that that means you know communications as well if I don't

65
00:06:22.64 --> 00:06:27.36
get you know communications with you then I can't support you if my weapons can't reach out and touch

66
00:06:27.36 --> 00:06:31.52
and give you support then we're not in supporting distance and that's too far away what does that mean

67
00:06:31.92 --> 00:06:38.32
you just change your perspective a little bit and dispersion which is positive but if you get too far

68
00:06:38.32 --> 00:06:50.40
apart it's negative so these lessons are the same over time and yet we still have to teach

69
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:57.92
because we still make mistakes and when we learn things from a different angle and even reading

70
00:06:57.92 --> 00:07:02.80
a document yesterday that's thousands or the last podcast that's a document thousands of years old

71
00:07:02.80 --> 00:07:10.24
you'd think yourself that after thousands of years thousands of years we would be talking about

72
00:07:10.24 --> 00:07:18.24
these leadership principles in the most commonly known way that everybody just like you know

73
00:07:18.24 --> 00:07:22.88
I couldn't have written extreme ownership because people would have been just you know saying hey

74
00:07:22.88 --> 00:07:27.84
no kidding dude what are you talking about this is this is part of the fabric of life

75
00:07:27.84 --> 00:07:35.44
but these things aren't they're they're not they're not the fabric of life they're they just seem

76
00:07:35.44 --> 00:07:42.72
to need to be rediscovered over and over again which is which is horrible but one thing I think allows

77
00:07:42.72 --> 00:07:48.56
us to learn them in a more complete way is seeing them from different angles from other experiences

78
00:07:48.56 --> 00:07:54.96
and today we're going to take a look at combat lessons which you know and that's the name of the

79
00:07:54.96 --> 00:08:01.68
document you're you're setting up in a good spot the subtitle it's published in 1944 the subtitle is

80
00:08:01.68 --> 00:08:11.52
rank and file in combat what they're doing how they are doing it so you know when I see that

81
00:08:11.52 --> 00:08:19.68
I'm thinking okay we are going to learn something so with that we will bust into this book

82
00:08:19.68 --> 00:08:26.72
combat lessons number one I've got number two chair will make a pair and send the future

83
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.48
the introduction of this thing this is one of those things where you get done reading the

84
00:08:32.48 --> 00:08:38.24
introduction and maybe you don't even have to read anything else because you're just almost there

85
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:44.96
introduction the purpose of combat lessons is to give our officers an enlisted men the benefit of

86
00:08:44.96 --> 00:08:52.08
the battle experiences of others which comes right out of learning you know it says Marine Corps

87
00:08:53.12 --> 00:08:59.76
to be of maximum benefit these lessons must be disseminated without delay they do not necessarily

88
00:08:59.76 --> 00:09:06.16
represent the carefully considered views of the war department they do however reflect the actual

89
00:09:06.16 --> 00:09:14.72
experiences of combat and therefore merit careful merit careful reading for this reason also

90
00:09:14.72 --> 00:09:21.28
no single issue can cover many of the phases of combat lessons will be drawn from the reports as they

91
00:09:21.28 --> 00:09:26.80
are received from the theaters of operation and quickly disseminated so that others may apply them

92
00:09:26.80 --> 00:09:31.84
the suggestions which are made or implied are not intended to change the tactical doctrine

93
00:09:31.84 --> 00:09:38.72
by which our army has been trained but rather to elaborate their on much of the subject matter

94
00:09:38.72 --> 00:09:44.40
has been covered in training literature but the comments show that shortcomings continue to

95
00:09:44.40 --> 00:09:53.76
manifest themselves on the battlefield and then it says this the paramount combat lesson

96
00:09:53.76 --> 00:10:01.44
learned from every operation is the vital importance of leadership our equipment our supply

97
00:10:01.44 --> 00:10:10.24
and above all our men are splendid aggressive and determined leadership is the priceless factor

98
00:10:10.24 --> 00:10:22.16
which inspires a command and upon which all success in battle depends it is responsible for success

99
00:10:22.16 --> 00:10:31.84
or failure I don't know if I have that thing trademark of leadership is the most important

100
00:10:31.84 --> 00:10:37.28
thing on the battlefield I don't I don't know if I but I don't know if I could even get a trademark

101
00:10:37.28 --> 00:10:48.80
right same exact thing same exact thing this is signed by general marshal who's the chief

102
00:10:48.80 --> 00:10:58.000
staff in the army during World War II he was in World War I first division he was an infantry

103
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.64
battoon commander in the Philippine American war and he signed in this thing so let's jump into it

104
00:11:08.64 --> 00:11:14.000
and you're going to see that this is one of the most straightforward documents that built

105
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.08
well it's straightforward as you can get because all it is basically is quotes from people on the

106
00:11:20.08 --> 00:11:27.12
front lines that's all this just quotes there's no there's there's there's some little added commentary

107
00:11:27.12 --> 00:11:37.20
occasionally section one infantry again and again reports from the battlefields confirm the

108
00:11:37.20 --> 00:11:46.000
importance of leadership in every grade whether it be corporal or kernel hmm other combat lessons are

109
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.24
important the exercise of leadership in battle is vital leadership has often been defined in theory

110
00:11:52.24 --> 00:11:58.08
here are some instances of its application or its absence on the battlefield these are

111
00:11:58.08 --> 00:12:06.48
about a few examples there are many others junior officer in battle captain T captain William T

112
00:12:06.48 --> 00:12:13.84
Gordon infantry Sicily since November 8th I have had 17 officers in my company

113
00:12:14.88 --> 00:12:20.88
and I am the only one who started out with it who is left to fight in Tunisia

114
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:26.88
the from troops pinned down in the dark I have heard in listed men call out such things as

115
00:12:26.88 --> 00:12:33.68
where is an officer to lead us we don't want to lie here we want to attack where is an officer

116
00:12:35.20 --> 00:12:41.04
in each case an officer or officers have risen to the occasion but this never the last shows

117
00:12:41.04 --> 00:12:49.20
beyond anything else the demand for battle leadership you know it's interesting they've we had a

118
00:12:49.20 --> 00:12:56.48
redess kind of went off yesterday during EF online talking about the leadership vacuum right

119
00:12:57.20 --> 00:13:04.24
and knowing when to step up and this is these situations right here you know my immediate

120
00:13:05.44 --> 00:13:10.80
my immediate thought is if I don't have in listed if I have enlisted people that are calling out you

121
00:13:10.80 --> 00:13:16.000
know hey where's an officer we want to attack I'm I'm not happy with my training I'm not happy

122
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.40
with my troops I'm not happy with a job that I did I'm not happy with my performance in

123
00:13:20.40 --> 00:13:24.56
preparing them for combat because if they need if there's a leadership vacuum and no one

124
00:13:24.56 --> 00:13:32.24
stepping up they need to step up don't we we had a conversation again that was on EF online yesterday

125
00:13:33.04 --> 00:13:37.68
where you you just because your in charge doesn't mean you need to talk

126
00:13:37.68 --> 00:13:50.80
in fact if you don't need to talk then you shouldn't talk if I walk into a room if we're having

127
00:13:50.80 --> 00:14:00.000
a meeting at echelon front and Jamie our operations director is you know if she's if she's

128
00:14:00.64 --> 00:14:04.08
putting out the word about what's gonna happen and I go in there and I see that she's got the

129
00:14:04.08 --> 00:14:06.96
timeline laid out and she told them where's where we need to be at what time and we're getting

130
00:14:06.96 --> 00:14:12.88
ready for the monster and she's got everything laid out what do I need to say I mean I'm officially

131
00:14:12.88 --> 00:14:24.72
in charge what do I need to say maybe maybe looks good thank you like maybe so you don't need

132
00:14:24.72 --> 00:14:27.76
to step up and you know I went into great detail in this and leadership strategy and tactics

133
00:14:27.76 --> 00:14:32.72
talking about this this leadership vacuum and how it appears sometimes and the real

134
00:14:32.72 --> 00:14:39.36
nitty gritty techniques that you pay attention to one of the things that you pay attention to is

135
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:44.08
if there's a leadership vacuum and no one else knows it they're not ready

136
00:14:44.64 --> 00:14:52.32
they might not be ready to make it to to follow we know when those there's when they don't sense

137
00:14:52.32 --> 00:14:55.92
it when they're just kind of sitting oh we're doing okay and you say hey we need to move

138
00:14:56.96 --> 00:15:01.04
your immediate response might be why wait what are you talking about they haven't

139
00:15:01.04 --> 00:15:05.12
sensed the leadership vacuum they don't know that there's a problem so sometimes you hesitate

140
00:15:05.12 --> 00:15:13.20
just a little bit longer let everyone feel that whore feel that lack of leadership and then when

141
00:15:13.20 --> 00:15:19.52
you step in there with a command boom they're waiting for it they're waiting for it and that is an

142
00:15:19.52 --> 00:15:25.84
important thing and that's an important it's an important dichotomy I'm sorry I have to say it's

143
00:15:25.84 --> 00:15:32.16
important dichotomy is that yes there will be many many times when you as a leader don't have to say

144
00:15:32.16 --> 00:15:40.40
anything and there will be many many times where your team is absolutely waiting and begging

145
00:15:41.36 --> 00:15:45.36
to be told hey this is what we need to do now

146
00:15:45.36 --> 00:15:57.20
back to the book a company officer must build a legend about himself he must take calculated

147
00:15:57.20 --> 00:16:03.60
risks he must on the other hand do what he expects his men to do he must always dig in

148
00:16:03.60 --> 00:16:09.12
always take cover his men must know that when he ducks they must duck on the other hand they

149
00:16:09.12 --> 00:16:17.84
must not believe that when the officer ducks they must run away the officer must come through

150
00:16:17.84 --> 00:16:27.84
every barrage and bombing with a sheepish grin and a rye remark masterly understatement of hardship

151
00:16:27.84 --> 00:16:38.96
and danger endured plus a grin always pays dividends yeah we got ambushed

152
00:16:38.96 --> 00:16:45.44
my first deployment to Iraq and I was in vehicle two and the tail end because we were driving

153
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:50.72
fast at night and everything and they got and I saw I mean I saw it's getting ambushed but we were

154
00:16:50.72 --> 00:16:58.000
going fast it was on up we were on a highway south of Baghdad and you know I'm looking at this point

155
00:16:58.56 --> 00:17:02.96
we were we were we would face not forward we would face out the sides and so you know I see

156
00:17:02.96 --> 00:17:11.84
RPGs going over and exploding and trace your fire to and from and but then you know what we just

157
00:17:11.84 --> 00:17:15.36
you know the lead drivers I pushed through push through which was just kind of what we're going to do

158
00:17:15.36 --> 00:17:25.12
keep going and then the shooting stops and we're still driving and then my my chief who is in the

159
00:17:25.12 --> 00:17:29.76
rear vehicle which is purposely set up that way because that way if you have to reverse you've got

160
00:17:29.76 --> 00:17:34.40
you know your lead your your your most senior leader in listed leaders in the back he's going to

161
00:17:34.40 --> 00:17:40.88
take and also if something goes wrong he's going to assess so he's back there and you know he says

162
00:17:42.32 --> 00:17:47.20
he's they got they got you know those RPGs were close the lock close to him that they were to me

163
00:17:47.20 --> 00:17:52.88
he comes up he's like hey start which you know first of all he rarely would call me sir you know

164
00:17:52.88 --> 00:17:58.000
but he's like hey sir you know we got ambushed back here and I could hear his voice he's a little freaked out

165
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:06.80
and I waited a solid you know like 10 seconds and then I came up and said Roger

166
00:18:07.60 --> 00:18:12.40
now what's it you know that was we got down to where we were going all like oh Roger you know

167
00:18:12.80 --> 00:18:18.64
so yeah I like this thing of you know hey just a little grin a rye remark

168
00:18:20.40 --> 00:18:25.60
would be good it's kind of like when your kid falls down yes exactly like when your kid falls down

169
00:18:25.60 --> 00:18:30.08
and then he looks at you kind of like what are we doing here we crying we whatever and then yeah

170
00:18:30.08 --> 00:18:36.96
you know no big deal kind of a thing we're laughing yeah we're laughing you know I used to say like oh

171
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:44.08
that was awesome nice yeah you're out this j-how you're lag it's going to bleed

172
00:18:44.08 --> 00:18:57.52
yeah my kid came home yesterday just blood everywhere he hit the reef you were so proud

173
00:18:57.52 --> 00:19:04.48
yeah no it's just you know he's just covered in blood and like yeah I'll re-forget you yeah

174
00:19:04.48 --> 00:19:09.36
for sure the barnacles what it is out here in California the the reefs are just rock it's not

175
00:19:09.36 --> 00:19:14.56
coral like you always hear about the coral reefs with the razors this is just rocks but they

176
00:19:14.56 --> 00:19:19.12
have barnacles on it if you go touch a barnacle they're sharp and if you fall and you scrape

177
00:19:19.12 --> 00:19:23.44
against them you're getting cut open you're gonna be bleeding everywhere but do not come into the

178
00:19:23.44 --> 00:19:29.04
house with the blood is the main level of the story get the hose get take care of business

179
00:19:30.80 --> 00:19:36.72
next section this is an interesting one and this really shows you

180
00:19:36.72 --> 00:19:43.92
this is one of those things where you think you know the world is different this was a different time

181
00:19:45.20 --> 00:19:54.72
this section says hate your enemy our men do not ordinarily hate they must hate

182
00:19:55.68 --> 00:20:01.36
they are better soldiers when they hate they must not frat nice with prisoners must not give them

183
00:20:01.36 --> 00:20:08.64
cigarettes and food the moment they are taken hate can be taught men by meticulous example

184
00:20:09.68 --> 00:20:19.92
the Rangers are so taught that's a different world but yeah that is not in any modern army

185
00:20:19.92 --> 00:20:28.48
publications and then you think about you know world war two you think about what those guys

186
00:20:28.48 --> 00:20:34.72
were going into you think about what you had to get but the mindset you had to bring out in people

187
00:20:34.72 --> 00:20:41.04
when they were in a landing craft and they were gonna go land on tarua or iwo jima or normandy

188
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:49.20
you got a you got a dig deep it's an interesting it's an interesting comment

189
00:20:49.20 --> 00:20:59.04
where we are we're at total war just so everyone doesn't freak out this isn't taught anymore

190
00:21:00.40 --> 00:21:06.56
and i will say this it's not taught anymore right now but we better remember this

191
00:21:07.68 --> 00:21:15.44
because if the world we could get to a place where this is needed again i'm sorry to report

192
00:21:15.44 --> 00:21:21.28
what i hope you don't i hope we can always be going into wars saying yeah it's a small element of

193
00:21:21.28 --> 00:21:26.80
people and they've got some bad feelings and they've got some reasons for their their

194
00:21:28.56 --> 00:21:33.92
anger towards us but we need to go and show them that we're a benevolent group and we can help them

195
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:38.96
move on those are all that's great hopefully we fight wars like that hopefully we won't have to

196
00:21:38.96 --> 00:21:45.52
fight anymore wars where the doctrine is being adjusted to get us to hate our enemy

197
00:21:52.08 --> 00:21:54.32
next one leaders in front

198
00:21:56.32 --> 00:22:03.84
staff sergeant Richard E. Deeland infantry Sicily we want our captains out front

199
00:22:03.84 --> 00:22:08.88
we don't much care about the position of our battalion commander that's it that's all that's

200
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:15.28
a whole note keep them moving

201
00:22:17.28 --> 00:22:21.68
operation report seven tharmysicely during an attack officers and noncommission officers must

202
00:22:21.68 --> 00:22:28.64
never allow men to lie prone and and passive under enemy fire they must be required to move

203
00:22:28.64 --> 00:22:35.60
forward if this is at all possible if movement is absolutely impossible have the troops at least

204
00:22:35.60 --> 00:22:45.20
open fire the act of firing induces self confidence in attacking troops the familiar expression

205
00:22:45.20 --> 00:22:53.36
dig or die has been greatly overworked attacking troops must not be allowed to dig in until they have

206
00:22:53.36 --> 00:23:00.56
secured their final objective if they dig in when momentarily stopped by enemy fire it will take

207
00:23:00.56 --> 00:23:07.76
dynamite to blast them from their holes and resume the advance this is another thing and we're

208
00:23:07.76 --> 00:23:14.16
going to get into some of this there's another element again where you get to total war

209
00:23:16.32 --> 00:23:19.76
and and that's what that's what that's what that's what these things are leaning towards we're

210
00:23:19.76 --> 00:23:25.12
in a totally different situation you know this is this is an existential war where if we don't win

211
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:29.60
America's not going to exist freedom will not exist in the world

212
00:23:33.12 --> 00:23:39.60
nco leadership staff sergeant Robert J. Camp platoon sergeant infantry Sicily

213
00:23:39.60 --> 00:23:46.40
nco leadership is important leaders nco's an officer should be taken to an OP for terrain instruction

214
00:23:46.40 --> 00:23:52.48
and study before an attack this has been possible in my outfit about one fourth of the time we have

215
00:23:52.48 --> 00:23:57.36
what is called an orders group which consists of that group of officers and nco's that must

216
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:04.48
be assembled for instruction before any tactical move simple clear concise orders get people together

217
00:24:04.48 --> 00:24:10.72
get face to face with them look at the terrain show them what they're seeing show them where they're

218
00:24:10.72 --> 00:24:19.76
going to move to and this seems real obvious and yet this guy is saying hey you better do it

219
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.72
keep your mission in mind Colonel eb fayer field artillery observer with fifth army

220
00:24:32.72 --> 00:24:39.12
Italy difficulty was experienced in making patrol leaders realized the importance of bringing back

221
00:24:39.12 --> 00:24:44.72
information by a specified hour in time to be a value patrols often returned after encountering

222
00:24:44.72 --> 00:24:50.000
resistance without accomplishing their mission sending them back to accomplish their mission

223
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.04
despite their fatigue seem to be the most effective solution to the training problem involved

224
00:24:55.04 --> 00:25:03.12
although the information required often arrived to late and then this other guy says this is

225
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:09.92
Lieutenant Colonel TF Bogart infantry and if actually Dave I know you haven't heard this yet

226
00:25:10.80 --> 00:25:15.20
I went on kind of a massive tangent the other day on the last podcast about

227
00:25:16.32 --> 00:25:24.96
seeing some of the seal machine gunners and just how entuned they were with their weapons and

228
00:25:24.96 --> 00:25:31.44
the great lengths that they would go to develop their own personal individual standard operating

229
00:25:31.44 --> 00:25:40.16
procedures so that they're working that thing like a pain or works a brush and just I said if

230
00:25:40.16 --> 00:25:44.64
if I could take videos and there's two guys in particular that that I was actually went through

231
00:25:44.64 --> 00:25:49.20
seal training with both of them and then I ended up in Patons with them at seal team one back in the

232
00:25:49.20 --> 00:25:58.56
day and if I had videos of them assaulting through targets with their M60 machine guns and the

233
00:25:58.56 --> 00:26:07.60
the the incredible smoothness which which they would handle the weapon and open up the feed tray

234
00:26:07.60 --> 00:26:13.20
and slap out extra links and pull out the new belt and slap feet just it would look beautiful

235
00:26:13.20 --> 00:26:17.28
and I was like that if if we could if you could post those videos no one would want to go to

236
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:22.24
war with America they know people like that are out there and it's not and obviously it's not just

237
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:29.92
seal machineners it's like every it's like there is a pocket of every every sector of the military

238
00:26:29.92 --> 00:26:37.20
where there are people that is what they are doing that's who they are yeah there's there's a

239
00:26:37.20 --> 00:26:43.20
version of that in everything for the people that they kind of fall in love with what they're doing

240
00:26:43.20 --> 00:26:48.24
and when they just fall in love with whatever their job is I would just kind of remarking as you

241
00:26:48.24 --> 00:26:53.12
go through these they're said in a way that I can't think of anything else to say other than

242
00:26:53.12 --> 00:26:58.72
yeah yeah do that that's really good and that the way he said is is is right and I'm kind

243
00:26:58.72 --> 00:27:02.32
of rocking my brain like how can I create some context around this like no that's that's it that's

244
00:27:02.32 --> 00:27:07.28
pretty good so I think I'm just going to sit here for the next hour listen to you just repeat

245
00:27:07.28 --> 00:27:12.56
with these guys have said but I mean the thing that's crazy about it is they seem so obvious and

246
00:27:12.56 --> 00:27:17.92
that's like you said earlier is in some ways it's a little bit disheartening at how often

247
00:27:17.92 --> 00:27:23.28
they need to be repeated because the way they're saying it isn't really that complex like man that's

248
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:30.40
that's as clear as anybody could say it do you think you take a statement and this goes back

249
00:27:30.40 --> 00:27:34.80
to what we were talking about as far as I'm a leader if I walk into a room and I sit through the

250
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:40.64
brief enough and needs to be said I'm not going to say anything if someone takes of something like

251
00:27:41.36 --> 00:27:46.16
a fundamental principle of combat cover move right and they say okay but I'm going to be

252
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:51.68
expanding on that a little bit and then they expand on it and then someone else expands on that

253
00:27:51.68 --> 00:27:56.80
expansion then someone else expands on that expansion and the next thing you know you don't even you

254
00:27:56.80 --> 00:28:03.28
can't you can't see cover move anymore become something else for sure that the the the the the

255
00:28:03.28 --> 00:28:07.52
complex of those things that's I think why these things are so powerful I was even right now

256
00:28:07.52 --> 00:28:12.56
the little notes to myself of what was my version of what you were just saying I wrote down like

257
00:28:12.56 --> 00:28:17.36
we we had the phrase mutual support that's what we called it in an airplanes we had to apply

258
00:28:17.36 --> 00:28:22.08
mutual support to each other it's cover move 100 just cover move it's all it is and

259
00:28:22.96 --> 00:28:29.68
technology is sort of redefined where we would need to be to apply that mutual support

260
00:28:30.24 --> 00:28:34.08
but the principle hasn't changed but if you're not carefully to get two wrapped up around this

261
00:28:34.08 --> 00:28:39.04
piece of technology allows me to get to this range over time you lose the idea that all that really

262
00:28:39.04 --> 00:28:44.000
matters is that you and I work closely enough together that I can cover you and you can cover me

263
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.04
and those roles will go back and forth in some sort of unknown it's not predetermined it's just

264
00:28:49.04 --> 00:28:53.60
gonna happen and the better we are the more naturally it happens but all it is is mutual support

265
00:28:53.60 --> 00:28:56.48
and I remember sitting and breathing like hang on are you just saying you want me to say a

266
00:28:56.48 --> 00:29:00.24
certain distance away from you so I can help you with it and when we interact with other aircraft

267
00:29:00.24 --> 00:29:05.04
hey just say that and if I it's trading too because if I get it wrong we can just come back and

268
00:29:05.04 --> 00:29:09.28
debrief it it's okay but you have spent like nine minutes talking about the nuances of that

269
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:12.88
when there's no way to predict and I've lost sight of what you're really trying to tell me which is

270
00:29:12.88 --> 00:29:20.72
don't get too far away man check the that just made me think I was up with an air wing in

271
00:29:20.72 --> 00:29:27.92
Fallen and I remember I don't even this is this is definitely one of my early sort of

272
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:37.12
grasping of the idea of cover move was we would put a squad on the ground and when we get

273
00:29:37.12 --> 00:29:42.80
extracted when we put on the ground or we get extracted I remember briefing the helicopter

274
00:29:42.80 --> 00:29:47.76
pilots and I don't know if I learned it from them or I don't know but I remember saying hey

275
00:29:47.76 --> 00:29:52.64
and I actually have I have a book that I wrote I have a book that I wrote when I was at

276
00:29:52.64 --> 00:29:58.96
Seal team when I was a communicator it's called communications and a lot of it I wrote it

277
00:29:58.96 --> 00:30:04.32
with a body of mine who is another communicator and he wrote a lot of this technical stuff about

278
00:30:04.32 --> 00:30:11.44
how to operate each individual radio and I just wrote my section I mean I helped him a little bit

279
00:30:11.44 --> 00:30:16.96
with that very little because he was smarter than me than so he wrote you know how to do the

280
00:30:16.96 --> 00:30:22.88
little things but I wrote all this stuff about hey when you're calling in a helicopter here's

281
00:30:22.88 --> 00:30:28.000
what you need to do and I'm going to find this because I have this book I have it and one of the

282
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.88
things I said was leave one helicopter at altitude to provide cover fire for the helicopter that's

283
00:30:34.88 --> 00:30:40.08
on the ground and here I was a new guy kind of thinking that I had a little something you know

284
00:30:40.08 --> 00:30:45.92
had a little something for these guys and that's one of the initial kind of thoughts around or

285
00:30:45.92 --> 00:30:51.84
me starting to realize that cover move wasn't just that that really was the fundamental of everything

286
00:30:51.84 --> 00:30:58.24
that we were doing and the other thing that I scratched down when when I talk about people you're

287
00:30:58.24 --> 00:31:02.64
talking about people being really good at their jobs I was doing some kind of an exercise at the

288
00:31:02.64 --> 00:31:09.28
camp Pendleton and somehow we got linked into a mortar a Marine Corps mortar element and

289
00:31:09.28 --> 00:31:18.32
bro these guys were doing Iads immediate action drills with their mortars and you know I just

290
00:31:18.32 --> 00:31:26.48
remember watching them and I don't know what I don't know how you put words I don't know what you

291
00:31:26.48 --> 00:31:32.40
know they were you know they're freaking 18 years old and they hear you know contact right

292
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:36.80
and then boom a guy's slapping down the base plate the guy's perfect as they're

293
00:31:36.80 --> 00:31:42.24
spitting on because they're doing a boom and they're getting rounds out like in so fast I don't know how

294
00:31:42.24 --> 00:31:48.88
fast it was but so fast accurate rounds and then immediately correcting bracketing and they're good

295
00:31:48.88 --> 00:31:54.16
and they're on target and you just think you know what we're good America's good

296
00:31:57.60 --> 00:32:03.92
alright Lieutenant Colonel TF Boger greater emphasis must be placed on

297
00:32:03.92 --> 00:32:10.16
inculcating in junior officers and NCOs the will to accomplish assigned missions despite opposition

298
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:15.28
a few accounts of patrol actions illustrate this point and he goes through these a

299
00:32:15.28 --> 00:32:19.92
reconnaissance patrol consisting of a platoon who sent out about 1900 one evening to determine the

300
00:32:19.92 --> 00:32:24.72
strength of any if any of Germans in two small towns the first about two miles away and the second

301
00:32:24.72 --> 00:32:28.88
about three miles farther on the patrol reached the outskirts of the first town in Metton the

302
00:32:28.88 --> 00:32:32.40
town in who told them there were no Germans in the town and then started to lead the patrol

303
00:32:32.40 --> 00:32:37.28
in to town a few hundred yards further farther a German machine gun opened up the Italian

304
00:32:37.28 --> 00:32:40.88
disappeared three of the patrol were killed and the others dispersed they drifted back to

305
00:32:40.88 --> 00:32:46.000
our battalion during the night and it was not until nearly daylight that the practically

306
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.20
valueless report of action was received not the slightest conception of the strength of the

307
00:32:51.20 --> 00:32:57.04
first town was obtained and no information of the second town it was necessary to send out another

308
00:32:57.04 --> 00:33:05.12
patrol with the same mission so that's that's number one and again I think this is this is just

309
00:33:05.12 --> 00:33:09.12
shows you that this is a different time and they're like hey you took some casualties you got three

310
00:33:09.12 --> 00:33:13.36
guys killed you it doesn't matter you got it you still got to go figure out what the strength was

311
00:33:13.36 --> 00:33:16.56
in there obviously got some Germans in there and by the way there's another town two miles away

312
00:33:16.56 --> 00:33:21.52
you need to go get on that too that is not a consistent attitude with the current

313
00:33:21.52 --> 00:33:27.84
operations right where you go oh yeah we took three casualties but we're continuing down here

314
00:33:27.84 --> 00:33:33.84
on this reconnaissance mission by the way freaking legit two a patrol sent out with the mission

315
00:33:33.84 --> 00:33:38.56
of determining the condition of a road especially bridges over a three mile stretch to the front

316
00:33:38.56 --> 00:33:42.88
when this patrol had covered about a mile at ran into a motorized German patrol two the Americans

317
00:33:42.88 --> 00:33:47.12
were killed and the patoon leader claimed six Germans the patrol leader forgot his mission

318
00:33:47.12 --> 00:33:51.52
returned to the paty on cp with the remainder of his patrol and had to be sent out again with a

319
00:33:51.52 --> 00:33:57.36
great loss in time getting the information desired this dude's out there gets into contact with a

320
00:33:57.36 --> 00:34:03.52
motorized German patrol has two guys killed killed six Germans comes back to base he's probably

321
00:34:03.52 --> 00:34:09.28
totally amped and feeling like he did a great job and they say hey did you complete your mission?

322
00:34:09.28 --> 00:34:18.64
no oh Roger that go back out these are hard men yeah last one on several occasions patrols

323
00:34:18.64 --> 00:34:22.72
were sent out on reconnaissance missions with instruction to get certain information by a specific time

324
00:34:22.72 --> 00:34:26.96
the hour would pass and sometimes several others without a word from the patrol sometimes it was

325
00:34:26.96 --> 00:34:30.96
due to difficulties encountered sometimes to mistakes and computation of time and space

326
00:34:30.96 --> 00:34:36.96
factors but in all cases there was no good reason why some information didn't get back by the

327
00:34:36.96 --> 00:34:47.12
specified time and here's I said there was some occasional comments amplifying information so

328
00:34:47.12 --> 00:34:52.40
here's the comment comment the failure of patrols in these instances stems from a lack of

329
00:34:52.40 --> 00:35:00.16
appreciation on the part of NCOs and junior officers of their missions in patrol actions as in

330
00:35:00.16 --> 00:35:05.92
the operations of larger units the mission must be kept upper most in the minds of all ranks

331
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:13.04
and no action should be undertaken which does not contribute directly to the accomplishment of that mission

332
00:35:13.04 --> 00:35:20.000
conversely no incidental or inadvertent contact with the enemy should deter or divert patrols

333
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.68
from the complete accomplishment of their missions to include compliance with all instructions given

334
00:35:25.68 --> 00:35:34.88
where humanly possible these guys are freaking just legit that's because this is total war yeah

335
00:35:34.88 --> 00:35:42.80
that's because this is an existential war there's there's so much insulation that we

336
00:35:42.80 --> 00:35:46.64
we sometimes try to create and I remember feeling it on my deployment to Ramadad which is

337
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:52.16
very different than my deployments in an aircraft and I even remember feeling the sense of wanting

338
00:35:52.16 --> 00:35:56.72
to insulate my own family from what I was doing that feeling of just wanting to keep them insulated

339
00:35:56.72 --> 00:36:02.24
from the reality when I see all that did to balance with from my wife is made it made it kind of

340
00:36:02.24 --> 00:36:06.16
worse because she had to create something in her mind and she had to try to piece it together

341
00:36:06.16 --> 00:36:11.44
which she simply couldn't do but that need to insulate if that ends up on the inside with your own

342
00:36:12.24 --> 00:36:19.68
folks and that becomes most obvious when you start losing people and the question of hey how

343
00:36:19.68 --> 00:36:24.80
much time are we gonna take how much downtime are we gonna take and I'm listening to this

344
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.12
and it's like that's not even a there's not we're not even that conversation isn't even happening

345
00:36:31.12 --> 00:36:36.000
we're not we're not talking about hey what are we gonna do to acknowledge what has happened here

346
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.16
which of course you want to do but this is not an option and the leadership isn't even

347
00:36:42.16 --> 00:36:46.64
conflent that that's funny the way he said that my mind immediately went like I want to write that

348
00:36:46.64 --> 00:36:50.40
differently instead of these staff and CEOs and the junior officers not understanding it it's

349
00:36:50.40 --> 00:36:56.72
the leadership has failed to explain to them the context that they should understand and we actually

350
00:36:56.72 --> 00:37:01.36
aren't doing our jobs I might have got ahead of myself it looks like you're laughing something

351
00:37:01.36 --> 00:37:04.48
I'm laughing even when he said that it was like no that's not what happened

352
00:37:05.28 --> 00:37:09.28
yeah I'm laughing because you can see my note right there says ownership question mark

353
00:37:09.92 --> 00:37:15.04
exact same thing is you know when when you blame your NCOs and your junior officers

354
00:37:15.04 --> 00:37:18.32
because they don't appreciate their mission yeah they don't understand it

355
00:37:19.04 --> 00:37:23.12
well guess what who's fault is that all day long it's my fault as a leader for letting those

356
00:37:23.12 --> 00:37:26.72
junior officers go out there and I'm not sitting over here trying to pick apart the things they're

357
00:37:26.72 --> 00:37:32.80
saying I'm just picturing every time every time I placed a demand on guys on my team that the

358
00:37:32.80 --> 00:37:37.20
understood it wasn't even hard for them to step up I mean it was a challenging situation but

359
00:37:37.20 --> 00:37:40.96
if they understand why we were just stepping up and making things happen when it was hard no

360
00:37:40.96 --> 00:37:47.12
factor my 18-year-old Marines were gone no factor but if I failed to give them that and then

361
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:51.60
something difficult happened that created some friction and some some doubt that was a much

362
00:37:51.60 --> 00:37:55.84
harder problem to get past if they didn't understand why they needed to get past it and that was

363
00:37:55.84 --> 00:38:02.48
always always on me always I or it was on the 18-year-old kid on his very first deployment

364
00:38:02.48 --> 00:38:06.32
that one of his closest friends had just gotten killed it's either on him or it's on me it

365
00:38:06.32 --> 00:38:11.20
is not even hard but if you gave him that context what they could overcome an endure

366
00:38:12.40 --> 00:38:15.36
I don't mean to say that it wasn't hard maybe that's the wrong way to describe it but boy they

367
00:38:15.36 --> 00:38:20.80
did it every single time without hesitation yeah that's that's the whole US military even though

368
00:38:20.80 --> 00:38:25.44
you know as I read this in like man these guys were hard but that's what we do in the military you

369
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:32.64
take casualties and then you you go you go do your job that's what you do

370
00:38:38.40 --> 00:38:43.76
next one team up captain William T Gordon infantry Sicily I have found that men in position must

371
00:38:43.76 --> 00:38:50.40
fight in pairs and order that 50% stay awake is thus easily enforced it bolsters morale

372
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:57.92
and nerves rally point in every company attack order a reserve force must be prescribed

373
00:38:57.92 --> 00:39:03.36
I always do even though sometimes this force consists only of myself and my first sergeant

374
00:39:04.08 --> 00:39:09.84
often a soldier who a moment before is runaway is converted to a fighter by leadership a reserve

375
00:39:09.84 --> 00:39:15.12
force gives him a rallying point that's brilliant just having a fallback point even if it's two

376
00:39:15.12 --> 00:39:20.16
people hey if you got to run away run to here and then who's there the platoon commander in the first

377
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:24.88
sergeant like all right buddy here takes a memo get ready because we're gonna rock and roll

378
00:39:28.72 --> 00:39:36.56
fear is normal Colonel George Taylor infantry Sicily fear of being afraid is the greatest

379
00:39:36.56 --> 00:39:42.000
obstacle for the new man in battle to overcome there is no reason for shame in being afraid

380
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.20
men who have had excellent battle records freely admit they are scared stiff and battle

381
00:39:47.20 --> 00:39:54.08
the important thing is that every soldier must be taught all he needs to know so well that

382
00:39:54.08 --> 00:40:00.24
battlefield thinking is reduced to a minimum automatic disciplined reactions to battlefield

383
00:40:00.24 --> 00:40:08.72
problems must be the rule in battle the worst element is mental and nervous exhaustion

384
00:40:09.76 --> 00:40:15.76
there is no real rest under fire the ability to withstand fire is more important than all the

385
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:26.56
knowledge in the world what are you writing down nervous exhaustion yeah the idea that you will

386
00:40:26.56 --> 00:40:32.64
exhaust yourself and render yourself incapable just by creating the fear in your mind

387
00:40:33.36 --> 00:40:37.92
but when you don't react what's going you just you and you just I've seen it where people get

388
00:40:37.92 --> 00:40:42.40
overwhelmed by the moment and they end up doing nothing and they literally exhaust themselves

389
00:40:42.40 --> 00:40:48.08
in in their own minds by being afraid of what's out there rather than just facing what's out there

390
00:40:48.08 --> 00:40:54.56
which is extremely hard to do but just the way he wrote that that nervous exhaustion such an

391
00:40:54.56 --> 00:40:59.12
awesome way to describe what sometimes people do when they're just freaking out of what's happening

392
00:40:59.12 --> 00:41:07.28
they exhaust themselves into doing nothing I got more than a couple times and

393
00:41:07.28 --> 00:41:14.16
actually my platoon of my first deployment we went to this outstation it was a special forces

394
00:41:14.16 --> 00:41:20.56
outstation it was in a rough neighborhood in Baghdad and we got murdered a decent amount that night

395
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:30.80
and like the next day let me rephrase that we probably got hit with an Rpg or two

396
00:41:30.80 --> 00:41:44.16
maybe a rifle fired grenade and then I don't know some number of mortars more than

397
00:41:44.88 --> 00:41:53.68
more than three or four like this decent right which by the way when you compare to this is just

398
00:41:53.68 --> 00:41:59.44
nothing it's just nothing and the reason I bring it up because even that one night you know one night

399
00:41:59.44 --> 00:42:05.92
of receiving some pretty consistent mortar fire was enough that you could see the next day

400
00:42:05.92 --> 00:42:13.52
guys were on edge guys were legitimately on edge after one night of light mortar attacks

401
00:42:15.04 --> 00:42:23.92
and that's just crazy and you could see that over time it's what we see in World War One you know

402
00:42:23.92 --> 00:42:28.96
those awful videos of World War One of guys that had shell shock legit shell shock

403
00:42:28.96 --> 00:42:35.20
and when we when we covered shot it dawn on here you know you break down people break down

404
00:42:35.20 --> 00:42:39.12
and it doesn't matter what you say what you do you're telling them you're gonna shoot them if they

405
00:42:39.12 --> 00:42:46.000
if they deserve and they do it anyways so the ability to withstand fires more important than

406
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:55.60
all the knowledge in the world I'll tell you something else I think the ability to withstand fire

407
00:42:55.60 --> 00:43:09.12
is related to an acceptance of death I mean if you are if you are scared of dying this is going

408
00:43:09.12 --> 00:43:14.40
to drive you insane yeah I think that's the nervous exhaustion right there you're gonna go insane

409
00:43:14.40 --> 00:43:23.44
if that's what you think about look man when I got when I got to Ramadi I was afraid of dying

410
00:43:23.44 --> 00:43:29.92
for a very brief period of time but I was I got there and I I remember I wrote about and

411
00:43:30.80 --> 00:43:36.40
I remember realizing as I probably was there for you know a little bit I had in some ways the

412
00:43:36.40 --> 00:43:39.76
benefit of knowing people that had been there knowing knowing what I was going to get myself into

413
00:43:39.76 --> 00:43:44.80
but when I got there I'm like oh man I'm here now and I remember thinking for a little while like

414
00:43:44.80 --> 00:43:52.64
oh this maybe maybe this is a bad idea maybe this is a mistake and there was a little bit of fear of dying

415
00:43:53.36 --> 00:44:00.08
and the time that I spent thinking about that was it was it was exhausting and then

416
00:44:01.68 --> 00:44:07.76
I you know what yes that might happen I literally considered to myself yep that might happen

417
00:44:07.76 --> 00:44:11.68
and I got past it and that was the end of it I never lost the idea that it could happen I fully

418
00:44:11.68 --> 00:44:15.92
understood that but I sort of just stopped thinking about it I didn't stop thinking about it because I

419
00:44:15.92 --> 00:44:19.28
didn't think it would happen I just stopped thinking about it because it was a kind of a useless

420
00:44:19.28 --> 00:44:23.68
thing to think about anymore but if you get trapped in that and I remember a small period of time

421
00:44:23.68 --> 00:44:28.40
of that feeling of like the paranoia that starts to build up of what you can end up creating

422
00:44:28.40 --> 00:44:33.20
is that you're going to die there's no way to get out of it and that becomes the obsession that you

423
00:44:33.20 --> 00:44:38.40
think about if you're going to go to combat you have to accept that that might happen and then you

424
00:44:38.40 --> 00:44:42.000
have to get past that and then go do whatever it is you're going to go do knowing that's a case

425
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.64
without letting it control you at all but again what I was going to face in my brush with war compared

426
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:56.88
to any of this other stuff is kind of crazy yeah there's another end of the spectrum too and I

427
00:44:56.88 --> 00:45:05.28
think I kind of went back and forth between two mindsets of one is you know what I can I can

428
00:45:05.28 --> 00:45:09.84
die that'll that could happen tonight and you know what I'm not going to die if it's not going to happen

429
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:16.16
but you know whatever watch this I'll stand out here in the street doesn't matter they can't kill me

430
00:45:16.16 --> 00:45:26.96
I mean in my first deployment to Iraq what did I write on my Humvee door once we got the

431
00:45:27.92 --> 00:45:34.08
we welded steel steel on there I think I think I wrote I cannot be killed on it

432
00:45:34.08 --> 00:45:41.12
and my guys made me take it off they were so freaked out they're like oh don't do that man

433
00:45:41.12 --> 00:45:47.52
that's a total of jakes don't do it don't do it so and you know even talking to Dean Latt

434
00:45:47.52 --> 00:45:53.44
Dean Latt you know going into Taroa it's like oh did you think you were going to get killed and he's like

435
00:45:53.44 --> 00:46:00.000
no of course not what do you think about week yeah and that might be the greatest story of all time

436
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.08
when his buddy went he pretended like he was dying his buddy pretend like he was dying and

437
00:46:06.08 --> 00:46:12.08
had his his friend the the chaplain come over and he was reading in this last right and then he

438
00:46:12.08 --> 00:46:21.12
starts laughing all right next section is about Sicily Italy and act too

439
00:46:21.12 --> 00:46:31.60
night attacks and they they get into attu which is that the battle up on the illusion island

440
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:37.60
the island of a two two thousand nine hundred Japanese soldiers

441
00:46:37.60 --> 00:46:51.52
two thousand eight hundred and seventy two of them killed 28 captured surprise saves lives

442
00:46:51.52 --> 00:46:57.68
major John R. Patterson infantry Sicily the mission of our battalion after landing

443
00:46:57.68 --> 00:47:06.16
itself south of Gala in Sicily was to capture the airport at Biscari the battalion used the

444
00:47:06.16 --> 00:47:11.84
silent night attack three rifle companies were in line with heavy machine heavy weapons company

445
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:17.84
in reserve to reach its line of departure the battalion crossed two ridges using control two control

446
00:47:17.84 --> 00:47:21.92
lines then climb the cliff at the airport to the light of departure all this was done silently

447
00:47:21.92 --> 00:47:26.40
under the cover of darkness the attack was started with a hand grenade we didn't fire until the

448
00:47:26.40 --> 00:47:33.44
Germans counterattack when we went with we went in with bayonets and hand grenades and caught some

449
00:47:33.44 --> 00:47:39.04
of the Germans undressing and dressing the tanks fired their guns but wouldn't close on us

450
00:47:39.76 --> 00:47:44.64
the enemy knew their men were all about so they fired their machine guns and rifles

451
00:47:44.64 --> 00:47:54.40
mainly into the air our attack lasted about 30 minutes we had no casualties during the attack

452
00:47:54.40 --> 00:48:02.56
two were killed during the counter attacks so that that that silent option I was do we were doing

453
00:48:02.56 --> 00:48:08.64
training I was at team two I was an assistant platoon commander they captured one of our

454
00:48:08.64 --> 00:48:14.40
seals they had him up and this is an urban combat training they had him up in the third floor of

455
00:48:14.40 --> 00:48:19.12
this building and they're telling you know yelling scream and so he's up there they're going to kill

456
00:48:19.12 --> 00:48:23.68
me and all this and they're waiting for us and they're waiting for us to do what we do which is

457
00:48:23.68 --> 00:48:27.60
you know and on the first floor clear the first floor moved the second floor moved the third floor

458
00:48:27.60 --> 00:48:35.92
clear the foot forget the rumor he is and I'm like you know silence we patrolled out we took the

459
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:40.56
fire escape up directly to the third floor didn't clear any of the other rooms and went right

460
00:48:40.56 --> 00:48:43.92
into where because we could see where he was we could hear where he was so we knew he isn't like one

461
00:48:43.92 --> 00:48:50.96
of one or two or three rooms and we caught those those up four guys completely off guard they're

462
00:48:50.96 --> 00:48:55.92
they're they're literally looking out the windows trying to see where we were and we walked in

463
00:48:55.92 --> 00:49:04.48
shot them all in the back rescued our guy but the what's important here is any goes into like a

464
00:49:04.48 --> 00:49:10.88
little bit a little bit more detail but you because we're being quiet you have to have good

465
00:49:10.88 --> 00:49:18.16
control lines of where you're going to let people get to hand the hand fighting

466
00:49:18.16 --> 00:49:27.12
Captain Gerald infantry at Biscari airport I used my trench knife twice one of my man got three

467
00:49:27.12 --> 00:49:33.04
with his bayonet he shot one then another tried to grab his bayonet he got this one with his bayonet

468
00:49:33.04 --> 00:49:36.72
that got him started so he got three in before it was all over

469
00:49:36.72 --> 00:49:51.84
small arms against arm we found that the the 30 caliber AP pierces enemy armored

470
00:49:51.84 --> 00:49:55.92
half tracks at close ranges that's something that everybody should know

471
00:49:59.28 --> 00:50:04.80
put to an action lieutenant hallrich infantry when the enemy machine guns opened up with

472
00:50:04.80 --> 00:50:11.04
three grenades the machine guns pulled back out of grenade fire then NCOs and Browning

473
00:50:11.04 --> 00:50:15.44
automatic riflemen went up over the embankment through and beyond the initial enemy positions

474
00:50:15.44 --> 00:50:22.32
eventually we had a base of fire about 20 men including the bars the BARs during the enemy counter

475
00:50:22.32 --> 00:50:28.56
attacks we did pretty well with other fire two led was flying fast and fiercely at 20 to 30 yards

476
00:50:28.56 --> 00:50:34.80
we fire at flashes in this kind of firing you learn to fire and roll to one side or they will

477
00:50:34.80 --> 00:50:39.68
soon get you I read the whole thing just to get that last little part if you're trooper out there

478
00:50:39.68 --> 00:50:45.44
if you're in the military you shoot and then you move because if you pop your head up again in

479
00:50:45.44 --> 00:50:47.36
that same spot you're going to take one

480
00:50:47.36 --> 00:50:58.000
common in all these accounts of a successful night attack by a small unit the application

481
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.68
of the following principles is worthy of note close control during the approach by the use of

482
00:51:03.68 --> 00:51:09.52
control lines adjusted to difficult terrain features designation of a line of departure as close

483
00:51:09.52 --> 00:51:17.20
to the objective as possible and after all major terrain obstacles have been passed this is a

484
00:51:17.20 --> 00:51:21.76
essential to assure proper organization of the unit immediately prior to the so you can

485
00:51:21.76 --> 00:51:26.80
to apply that right there so many business things right there like you get everything ready to go

486
00:51:26.80 --> 00:51:31.60
you get past all the main obstacles once everyone's passed the main obstacles then you execute

487
00:51:31.60 --> 00:51:38.48
attainment of the vital surprise use of the bayonet and hand grenades with no weapon firing

488
00:51:38.48 --> 00:51:43.60
permitted it may often be advisable to prohibit the loading of rifles and for anyone that doesn't

489
00:51:43.60 --> 00:51:47.92
understand why these guys are talking about using grenades so much grenades do not give away your

490
00:51:47.92 --> 00:51:52.32
position neither do bayonets so you can hug grenades and no one knows where it just came from there's

491
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:58.40
no one to shoot at there's no muscle flush and so it's a great weapon when you are attacking from

492
00:51:58.40 --> 00:52:05.20
like a clandestine situation where you don't want the enemy to know where you are you so front

493
00:52:05.20 --> 00:52:11.76
of attack only any attempt at development tends to cause disorder and confusion note that one

494
00:52:11.76 --> 00:52:17.20
puttune which had advanced ahead of the general lines was pulled back to conform so they're saying

495
00:52:17.20 --> 00:52:22.08
frontal attack only and what they're saying is don't try and surround because if you try and

496
00:52:22.08 --> 00:52:25.68
surround people at night and you're gonna end up on opposite sides and you're gonna end up in a

497
00:52:25.68 --> 00:52:33.12
blue on blue situation I don't think that they mean don't set up flank situations

498
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:40.24
a definite and limited objective capture of an airfield in this case in which the entire front

499
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:45.12
could be covered by manpower rather than firepower all that's good these are the major elements

500
00:52:45.12 --> 00:52:49.84
of successful night attack brought out in the foregoing account others not mentioned but which

501
00:52:49.84 --> 00:52:55.60
were undoubtedly contributing contributing factors of the operation are careful planning in my new

502
00:52:55.60 --> 00:53:02.56
detail precise specific orders careful arrangement for maintenance of direction throw daylight

503
00:53:02.56 --> 00:53:08.08
reconnaissance by as many of the leaders as possible use of compound use of compact columns

504
00:53:08.08 --> 00:53:12.88
in the approach so the reason that they're saying precise specific orders that's different

505
00:53:12.88 --> 00:53:17.76
that's different than what we normally talk about the reason is because you are attempting to

506
00:53:17.76 --> 00:53:25.28
make this happen without having the enemy get a vote so once the enemy gets a vote if you

507
00:53:25.28 --> 00:53:30.80
two specific things change now we don't know what to do but we are setting this thing up to be

508
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:36.72
very specific and we should be able to get to our last point of concealment we should be in our

509
00:53:36.72 --> 00:53:42.40
positions everything should be good once that attack starts you know you still want to keep them

510
00:53:42.40 --> 00:53:49.04
constrained because it's nighttime yeah the context of the night pieces also I think really

511
00:53:49.04 --> 00:53:53.36
important because it seems what he's what they're saying is that there's a lot more close control

512
00:53:54.48 --> 00:53:59.36
under a night attack requires a whole lot of things because when the chaos ensues under an attack

513
00:53:59.36 --> 00:54:06.24
you were denied something that you usually rely on so heavily and when you were reading that

514
00:54:06.24 --> 00:54:10.32
and again it's under the context of a night assault it's different it's different at night

515
00:54:11.12 --> 00:54:15.20
you told a story long time ago that I've used a bunch and there's a version of it I have from

516
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:22.96
flying which was when we started using NVG's the way we described the use of NVG's why we would use

517
00:54:22.96 --> 00:54:28.72
NVG's in airplane is the most simplest way to describe it is it allows us to use daytime tactics

518
00:54:29.44 --> 00:54:34.32
at night which before you just couldn't do you actually you want the least amount of

519
00:54:34.32 --> 00:54:38.16
close control is possible you need to have some but in the day you don't need it as much because

520
00:54:38.16 --> 00:54:44.56
you can rely on being able to see each other and when you started to see people like reject the idea

521
00:54:44.56 --> 00:54:50.32
of things that allowed you to maneuver in different ways using technology because why would I do

522
00:54:50.32 --> 00:54:58.08
it like that the night creates an environment that's really hard to operate in and if you're going to

523
00:54:58.08 --> 00:55:02.80
be successful at night you have to do a lot more things than you would normally do during the day which

524
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:07.84
is why some of the technology pieces are so nice to allow you to do it but even with that you can't

525
00:55:07.84 --> 00:55:12.32
pretend like the two are the same and the detail is going through I'm all thinking like yeah you

526
00:55:12.32 --> 00:55:16.80
wouldn't do that during the day you have to do that at night yeah yeah and now that we're talking

527
00:55:16.80 --> 00:55:21.44
about it when you're talking about this size element because I'm saying hey you could still set up

528
00:55:21.44 --> 00:55:26.72
flanks but if it's nighttime you got a big element I actually wouldn't I would set up a complete

529
00:55:26.72 --> 00:55:31.92
online assault we would all be together we would all be within you know communication distance

530
00:55:31.92 --> 00:55:35.92
and we're going to not make those mistakes and we're going to know where everyone is because

531
00:55:35.92 --> 00:55:41.44
when you're online you've got free fire and eight or at in 180 degrees ahead of you it's an

532
00:55:41.44 --> 00:55:50.96
awesome thing that's going to that's going to that's going to overwhelm or make the idea of having

533
00:55:50.96 --> 00:55:57.28
another element on the flank obsolete because you're firepower so unrestricted when you're online

534
00:55:57.28 --> 00:56:00.72
and that's you know it's like you can either solve online or you can set up an al that's it

535
00:56:01.84 --> 00:56:04.56
and then there's these little other variations where you can start to develop an

536
00:56:04.56 --> 00:56:10.16
development is very very dangerous and you better have some serious control measures in place if

537
00:56:10.16 --> 00:56:15.76
you're going to try that very serious control measures including up to an including pieces of

538
00:56:15.76 --> 00:56:21.04
terrain that actually prevent you from having a blue on blue because there's a freaking mountain

539
00:56:21.04 --> 00:56:27.20
or a ravine or whatever that prevents you from getting shot by your own guys.

540
00:56:31.60 --> 00:56:36.96
All right this this little section here starts to jump into really specific stuff knocking out

541
00:56:36.96 --> 00:56:46.88
pill boxes and then it gets into individual initiative. The following cases of individual initiative

542
00:56:46.88 --> 00:56:53.28
and heroism during the Soleno landing were reported by the infantry.

543
00:56:55.36 --> 00:57:01.84
Sergeant Manuel Gonzalez upon landing discovered the position of a German 88 in the sand dunes near

544
00:57:01.84 --> 00:57:07.92
the beach this gun was firing on the assault boats as they landed the sergeant crept around the position

545
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:14.96
under machine gun fire which said is pack on fire and despite the hand grenades being thrown at him

546
00:57:14.96 --> 00:57:21.68
he then calmly tossed several hand grenades into a gun placement killing the crew and blowing up their ammunition

547
00:57:23.68 --> 00:57:28.40
yeah you're going to see each one of these these these are talking about individual initiative what they are is just

548
00:57:30.08 --> 00:57:38.08
just pure heroics. Sergeant John Y McGill jumped on an enemy tank and dropped the hand grenade

549
00:57:38.08 --> 00:57:44.88
into the open turret killing the crew private Clayton I Tallman on hill 424 observed that the

550
00:57:44.88 --> 00:57:50.24
enemy was attempting an development of the left flank of his company taking up a better position

551
00:57:50.24 --> 00:57:55.36
he killed an enemy machine gun crew with three carefully aimed shots in a few minutes he repeated

552
00:57:55.36 --> 00:57:59.68
the same action when another enemy machine gun crew appeared he alone protected the left flank of

553
00:57:59.68 --> 00:58:09.20
the company until the rest of the platoon arrived private barel b right discovered that he and a group of

554
00:58:09.20 --> 00:58:14.32
five men have been cut off from his company he immediately organized them into a defensive position on a

555
00:58:14.32 --> 00:58:18.32
small no they repuls three rushes by the enemy who were attempting to establish machine gun

556
00:58:18.32 --> 00:58:23.60
positions on the flank private right was completely in command of the situation giving orders and

557
00:58:23.60 --> 00:58:32.40
shouting encouragement yeah I was going off on that last podcast about having team members that

558
00:58:32.40 --> 00:58:42.48
are going to step up and just make things happen. Staff Sergeant Quillin H McGmitchen was shot in

559
00:58:42.48 --> 00:58:49.76
the chest and shoulder and shoulder before his assault boat reached the shore I say that again shot

560
00:58:49.76 --> 00:58:56.80
in the chest and shoulder before he reaches the shore have you read a shoulder injury echo Charles

561
00:58:56.80 --> 00:59:02.80
yes yeah we were like ah you know I really can't do anything right or you hurt you know you get

562
00:59:02.80 --> 00:59:07.60
somebody with that poles that are pack muscle or whatever yeah what do they do for the next six months

563
00:59:07.60 --> 00:59:13.36
say they they sit around and drink warm milk what does it mention do well when the boat

564
00:59:13.36 --> 00:59:17.76
reached the beach the landing ramp stuck and would not drop the sergeant despite his wounds

565
00:59:17.76 --> 00:59:22.88
kicked the ramp loose and then let his section ashore continuing to wreck their operations

566
00:59:22.88 --> 00:59:34.96
until he received a fatal shot from enemy gunfire. Pre assault you get shot in the chest and

567
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:39.36
shoulder when you get shot in the shoulder you're not using that arm and then you get shot in the

568
00:59:39.36 --> 00:59:49.04
chest as well arm and moved ahead in the face of the intense fire and cleared the beach as

569
00:59:49.04 --> 00:59:53.92
soon as possible lieutenant carry soon after reaching the shore was fired upon by three Germans

570
00:59:53.92 --> 00:59:58.88
armed with machine pistols he returned fire but his car being jammed after killing one of the

571
00:59:58.88 --> 01:00:07.12
of his adversaries he then grasped his weapon as a club and advancing in the face of their fire

572
01:00:07.12 --> 01:00:14.64
clubbed the second then he physically tackled subdued and disarmed the third German taking him prisoner

573
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.08
the ability the individual soldier to grasp the implications of the situation and take the necessary

574
01:00:28.08 --> 01:00:35.20
action should be fully exploited the results of combat are the fruits of combined efforts of

575
01:00:35.20 --> 01:00:42.80
individuals every soldier should be indoctrinated with the idea that his individual action

576
01:00:42.80 --> 01:00:46.16
may be the decisive factor in the final result

577
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:54.56
leader substrategy in tactic every guy in the cartoon is the most important guy

578
01:00:54.56 --> 01:01:05.28
true statement true statement that that comment is so I mean it is so powerful that they can

579
01:01:05.28 --> 01:01:13.04
that they understand that what they do individually can change the entire outcome of the entire

580
01:01:13.04 --> 01:01:18.08
operation and what's crazy when I'm listening to these these stories of just like you described

581
01:01:18.08 --> 01:01:24.24
just total acts of heroism they called it initiative and heroly what's crazy about that is for

582
01:01:24.24 --> 01:01:27.92
the ones that have ended up metal of honor or these ones that end up telling their stories

583
01:01:28.64 --> 01:01:34.32
they all say the exact same thing and I'm paraphrasing but they all say I don't feel like a hero

584
01:01:34.32 --> 01:01:38.64
I just doing my job that's what they all say they just have this simple way of describing

585
01:01:39.76 --> 01:01:43.36
I wasn't doing it to be a hero I needed to take out that machine gunest

586
01:01:44.32 --> 01:01:50.16
Tom five's like I didn't think of it in like any heroic I needed to blow up that tank so I got out of

587
01:01:50.16 --> 01:01:55.44
the tank and took her and they downplay it so much that when you're listening to your kind of

588
01:01:55.44 --> 01:02:00.56
just an all like bro are you kidding me you're a total hero but they never see it like that there's

589
01:02:00.56 --> 01:02:05.52
like I had to do this my men need me to do this so I just didn't the last thing I was thinking

590
01:02:05.52 --> 01:02:10.000
about was the right up that I was going to get if I attacked this position and they do things

591
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.72
that just seem completely superhuman and the way they able to do that is they understand

592
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:19.76
that what they do has huge impact on the people around them which is crazy you can teach that

593
01:02:19.76 --> 01:02:24.88
to a human being yeah imagine if you had a company where every single person inside your company

594
01:02:24.88 --> 01:02:29.76
thought that each individual action that they had would have an impact on the entire company as a whole

595
01:02:30.56 --> 01:02:38.000
what if you could indoctrinate and inculcate that idea into your team imagine what that team would be like

596
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:50.40
action on actu operations report regimen will combat team to fight the japs in this in this

597
01:02:50.40 --> 01:02:57.36
country our troops must stick to high ground and not only outflank but out altitude the enemy

598
01:02:59.52 --> 01:03:04.48
the high ground continuous movement is necessary to keep the spark in an attack

599
01:03:04.48 --> 01:03:10.88
if a machine gun covers one point then a group not at that point must continue to advance

600
01:03:13.68 --> 01:03:20.40
when fire is shifted the original group must move even if the platoon is entirely halted

601
01:03:20.80 --> 01:03:28.24
by the fire of enemy guns then the commitment of additional troop results whereas by proper coordination

602
01:03:28.24 --> 01:03:36.48
some portion of the platoon can be kept moving and the force committed kept to a minimum that's

603
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:46.64
his number one thing is covered move the tendency of lower commanders to commit reserves to early must be

604
01:03:46.64 --> 01:03:53.84
curved security cannot be over emphasized any movement or group on the battlefield even in a rear

605
01:03:53.84 --> 01:03:59.04
areas is subject to enemy action in this connection consideration must be given to the protection

606
01:03:59.04 --> 01:04:04.64
of medical installation at present these are left unprotected without even individual arms for

607
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:09.52
the personnel in the event of enemy penetration through our frontline positions it is practically

608
01:04:09.52 --> 01:04:13.44
certain that these installations will be hit why are they given that lessons because that's exactly

609
01:04:13.44 --> 01:04:19.44
what happened on like a suicide attack from the japanese aggressive patrolling particularly to maintain

610
01:04:19.44 --> 01:04:24.72
active content contact is a vital importance it can mean the difference between defeat and victory

611
01:04:25.76 --> 01:04:31.84
however mere numbers of patrols will not solve the problem special training in patrolling in

612
01:04:31.84 --> 01:04:38.40
organizing patrols must be initiated commanders must plan to have reasonably fresh men

613
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:44.32
available for night contact it is vital to organize patrol activity carefully to ensure that

614
01:04:44.32 --> 01:04:49.84
all lines are familiar with the roots returning of returning patrols so that the danger of mistaken

615
01:04:49.84 --> 01:04:57.44
identity in the darkest will be minimized yeah they got the the the japanese on their attack

616
01:04:57.44 --> 01:05:06.32
made it they broke through and it was fighting in the rear lieutenant general Simon B. Buckner

617
01:05:06.32 --> 01:05:11.76
commanding general asking department it was apparent that the enemy was particularly vulnerable to

618
01:05:11.76 --> 01:05:16.40
attack by units of our infantry which pushed forward vigorously while the enemy was held down by

619
01:05:16.40 --> 01:05:22.80
artillery fire what we call that you cover move those units which had learned to advance closely

620
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:28.24
behind their own artillery supporting fire had the greatest success the japs do not like our

621
01:05:28.24 --> 01:05:34.56
coordinated artillery fire nor do they like our attacks with the bayonet when under fire from

622
01:05:34.56 --> 01:05:41.52
small arms they stay down in their holes and are easily approached when attacking small groups of

623
01:05:41.52 --> 01:05:46.32
foxholes our troops were able to keep the japs down by fire from rifles and the browning

624
01:05:46.32 --> 01:05:50.96
automatic rifle while some of our men approached and drop hang grenades into their holes this

625
01:05:50.96 --> 01:05:57.76
is our favorite mop up method cover move when about to be run out of a position the japs seem to

626
01:05:57.76 --> 01:06:02.16
feel it necessary to counter attack these attacks were not well coordinated and were welcomed by

627
01:06:02.16 --> 01:06:08.24
our troops who were able to shoot down the enemy in great numbers these jap counter attacks were part

628
01:06:08.24 --> 01:06:14.64
of a suicidal character and were pressed home regardless of losses until practically all the

629
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:22.72
counter attack and troops were exterminated the enemy may believe that in such terrain he can

630
01:06:22.72 --> 01:06:30.48
hold up the advance of an entire battalion with three men and a light machine gun in fact however

631
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:36.24
he is critically vulnerable to intelligent action by officers and men who understand the necessity

632
01:06:36.24 --> 01:06:41.68
for immediate maneuver against small parties of the enemy seeking to hold them up the fact was

633
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:45.60
that a small maneuvering that small maneuvering patrols easily disposed of machine gun

634
01:06:45.60 --> 01:06:50.88
positions on reverse slopes behind mount spurs whereas any tendency to lie down and call for artillery

635
01:06:50.88 --> 01:06:56.000
support whatever resulted only in tremendous wastage of artillery fire and attempting to seek

636
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.84
out targets which in fact were inaccessible artillery fire that's an important point so you think

637
01:07:01.84 --> 01:07:07.92
oh we got a machine gun up there we need a call for fire and now you think about how hard it's

638
01:07:07.92 --> 01:07:11.36
going to be for the start to lead a hit this place that's bunkered in or they're on the reverse

639
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:16.40
slope of a mountain or whatever it's a real problem and yet these guys realize if they just

640
01:07:17.12 --> 01:07:23.36
aggressively maneuvered on that machine gun they'd be able to take it out the attue action

641
01:07:23.36 --> 01:07:29.28
likewise indicated that standard japini's infiltration tactics can be offset by a system of

642
01:07:29.28 --> 01:07:33.84
anti-termite patrols organized behind our lines protecting artillery command posts and supply

643
01:07:33.84 --> 01:07:38.96
lines wherever troops know that these friendly patrols were behind them fire in a rear will

644
01:07:38.96 --> 01:07:45.12
mean separate that our patrols are cleaning people up goes into the south Pacific

645
01:07:46.56 --> 01:07:50.40
talking about the jungle jungle notes aggressive action flexible plant plans

646
01:07:50.40 --> 01:07:58.96
report of the 43rd division new Georgia aggressive action is necessary never relax the pressure

647
01:08:02.72 --> 01:08:09.44
never relax the pressure that's a good that's a good just thing to think about every time you wake

648
01:08:09.44 --> 01:08:14.80
up in the morning never relax the pressure maneuver of small units at risk of temporary loss

649
01:08:14.80 --> 01:08:22.32
of communications is important plans and orders must be so flexible as to permit prompt maneuver

650
01:08:22.32 --> 01:08:27.04
change this is another thing where I would feel like I was cheating when I was you know going through

651
01:08:27.04 --> 01:08:33.28
training and stuff because we would make these really flexible plans and of course the training

652
01:08:33.28 --> 01:08:37.92
cadre is gonna do things to disrupt your plan and when your plan gets disrupted and it's super

653
01:08:37.92 --> 01:08:44.56
flexible like I would ever you know go plan be go with plan C no factor never relax the pressure

654
01:08:44.56 --> 01:08:50.32
it's actually pretty hard did disrupt a plan that's not very rigid you know yeah we didn't have like

655
01:08:50.32 --> 01:08:56.08
37 steps that you can interrupt we had a basic idea and some real good ideas how we're gonna maneuver

656
01:08:56.08 --> 01:09:03.92
and disrupting that's much harder to that that that that that last one was awesome which one

657
01:09:03.92 --> 01:09:10.88
the the one we talked about never never ever relax pressure yeah like but I think the title that was

658
01:09:10.88 --> 01:09:16.32
aggressive action flexible plans whatever that title was just that alone obviously the description

659
01:09:16.32 --> 01:09:22.56
makes it even better but that in and of itself that will solve just that mindset yeah solves

660
01:09:22.56 --> 01:09:28.64
so many problems in a world anywhere in your world there's a couple things that you need to be aware of

661
01:09:29.68 --> 01:09:37.68
the way that you have flexible plans is you are religious about making sure everyone understands

662
01:09:37.68 --> 01:09:43.92
the commanders intent that's if you can do that hey this is what this is the overall thing that

663
01:09:43.92 --> 01:09:48.88
we're trying to accomplish here's the couple parameters you got to work within other than that make it

664
01:09:48.88 --> 01:09:55.12
happen yeah get aggressive making it happen because if you just make a flexible plan and you think

665
01:09:55.12 --> 01:09:59.04
hey you know you guys come in from the west and you guys come in from the south there's all kinds of

666
01:09:59.04 --> 01:10:03.20
things that go wrong with that plan it's super flexible but no one knows where they can't go where they can't

667
01:10:03.20 --> 01:10:08.88
go there's no deconfliction set up so you need to think about it the other thing that's interesting

668
01:10:08.88 --> 01:10:14.40
about aggressive action flexible plans is the more you plan the more detail you get the worse your

669
01:10:14.40 --> 01:10:20.40
plan becomes now if you come up with a plan in three minutes you probably need a little bit more

670
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:28.32
time although I have executed operations where I we planned for 15 minutes my boss asked me that my

671
01:10:28.32 --> 01:10:32.08
boss said how much time do you guys need to launch this is my first deployment my second

672
01:10:32.08 --> 01:10:36.72
deployment no one asked me they already knew the answer my first point how much time you guys need

673
01:10:36.72 --> 01:10:48.48
I was like 15 minutes that's how much time what you're getting at though is the propensity of

674
01:10:48.48 --> 01:10:54.40
what how the things usually work out do we usually plan too much or not enough it's pretty rare

675
01:10:54.40 --> 01:10:58.88
that we don't plan enough what typically happens is we overplan an overplan an overplan and

676
01:10:58.88 --> 01:11:02.64
there's an old saying I don't know if it's just an aviation it's how long do you have to plan

677
01:11:02.64 --> 01:11:06.80
your mission and the joke is thirty how long do you need to plan your mission and the joke is the

678
01:11:06.80 --> 01:11:12.32
thirty minutes more than you have and the reason is is we have a propensity to overplan oh it

679
01:11:12.32 --> 01:11:17.52
says that maybe a nation yeah I thought I made that up you did not make it up unless it was on your

680
01:11:17.52 --> 01:11:21.52
trip to fall and all of a sudden you're the reason we said and we've been saying that for years and

681
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:25.60
the point is kind of what you're getting at is oh if you gave me nine hours planned guess how long

682
01:11:25.60 --> 01:11:32.16
I'm going to plan nine hours can you underplan yes you absolutely can you can plan for two minutes

683
01:11:32.16 --> 01:11:36.48
when you actually need to spend some more time but the driver is is what you were saying is hey

684
01:11:36.48 --> 01:11:40.08
I only need 15 minutes I need to cover the key points the highlights and if you've got a team that's

685
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:44.48
well trained they might even recognize you to listen we got a little additional risk here because

686
01:11:44.48 --> 01:11:48.48
we didn't really have time to dissect this once when we get to this place in the mission we need to be

687
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:52.32
a little more aware that we're going to need to be a little more flexible and we have we're

688
01:11:52.32 --> 01:11:57.04
less aware than we like to be but I know that as opposed to hey let's take three days to plan

689
01:11:57.04 --> 01:12:00.32
by the time we get to the objective it's a total waste of time because because that mission has

690
01:12:00.32 --> 01:12:07.04
come and gone most teams that we work with overplan they overthink they over create and then

691
01:12:07.04 --> 01:12:12.48
when they go out to implement they're either too late or they're so rigid and what they do they can't

692
01:12:12.48 --> 01:12:19.12
maneuver around so if you're looking for the balance there less is typically more not always not 100

693
01:12:19.12 --> 01:12:23.92
percent of the time but that's where your bias should be it's kind of like packing right for

694
01:12:23.92 --> 01:12:30.24
trip kind of the same mindset which is like overpacking people overpack because they think of all

695
01:12:30.24 --> 01:12:35.20
the different scenarios they're going to need this jacket those socks this shoe and you flip

696
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:39.92
flops too for the you see I'm saying mean while you got a washer dryer there you know you don't need

697
01:12:39.92 --> 01:12:44.96
all that stuff it'd be flexible same same yeah otherwise you got all these suitcases you know

698
01:12:44.96 --> 01:12:51.52
it's the same mindset is what I'm saying yeah yeah if you underpack but you're flexible

699
01:12:52.24 --> 01:12:58.48
it's way better yeah maneuver you can maneuver you know yeah it is weird that it's such an

700
01:12:58.48 --> 01:13:04.64
advantage to come up with a nice flexible plan that everybody knows and it's so easy man that

701
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:11.76
the planning the planning what when I call it like the the evolution of planning inside the

702
01:13:11.76 --> 01:13:18.08
sealed teams you know at one point it was beyond insanity we wrote about it in an extreme

703
01:13:18.08 --> 01:13:25.52
ownership I mean it was a way Seth and Lave were taught to plan was was mayhem it was it was 150

704
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:32.80
slide power points yeah that you know oh it your fonts wrong you follow you that you need to go

705
01:13:32.80 --> 01:13:37.44
through this branch plan and this other thing over here may when those guys started working with me

706
01:13:37.44 --> 01:13:42.24
I remember when I when I then it's talked about this in extreme ownership when I was telling

707
01:13:42.24 --> 01:13:49.04
those guys hey just make a plan that the lowest common denominator I get up have people walk through

708
01:13:49.04 --> 01:13:56.64
it look at the map use the map draw a picture draw it up on the whiteboard do that I remember Seth

709
01:13:56.64 --> 01:14:03.44
was looking at me like he was going to get fired like when he gives this brief he's going to get

710
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:09.04
fired and it's funny because usually I would get that I would feel a little bit more push back from

711
01:14:09.04 --> 01:14:13.76
life on stuff and Seth would be like rea Roger and Lave would have why would we do like that

712
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:19.52
and this time for whatever reason I think I think Lave actually just realized that this was the

713
01:14:19.52 --> 01:14:24.56
smartest thing he'd ever heard I think Lave just said to himself you know what this actually

714
01:14:24.56 --> 01:14:31.28
freaking makes sense and he was so on board with it he was so stoked and he had BTF Tony was his chief

715
01:14:31.28 --> 01:14:37.60
and that's the way you know Tony knew how to make shit happen and and I just but but Seth was just

716
01:14:37.60 --> 01:14:43.92
freaked out like well I mean you think he was so freaked out by the fact of thinking that

717
01:14:43.92 --> 01:14:51.28
he was getting fired for for trying to make his men understand what was going to happen on this

718
01:14:51.28 --> 01:14:56.16
mission and the cool thing was the commanding officer when when they got done because it was two

719
01:14:56.16 --> 01:15:00.72
platoon's going out on on an SR you know on a reconnaissance mission and they both took their

720
01:15:00.72 --> 01:15:06.32
platoon's out when they got done the you know the commanding officer who had gone around and

721
01:15:06.32 --> 01:15:11.04
watched all the platoon's give all their briefs and give all these 150 power points slides and

722
01:15:11.04 --> 01:15:17.52
do all these you know what what is it called animation in your slides he'd watched all those things

723
01:15:17.52 --> 01:15:22.88
and he he said these these are the best briefs of scene which was freaking awesome it was awesome

724
01:15:22.88 --> 01:15:29.20
because if the commanding officer can't follow what the hell is going to happen on an operation how

725
01:15:29.20 --> 01:15:35.36
is a new guy he four machine gunner can you not following anything and the more flexible you make these

726
01:15:35.36 --> 01:15:40.56
plans we're not all rigid what's kind of crazy about that is that commanding officer was

727
01:15:40.56 --> 01:15:45.28
probably stoked that the brief took nine minutes not forty nine minutes he was probably waiting

728
01:15:45.28 --> 01:15:49.76
like there we go yeah we're gonna come in and and he would probably look like that's it that's awesome

729
01:15:49.76 --> 01:15:56.16
yeah I mean it was you know it's still an hour long yeah but an hour long of real information

730
01:15:56.16 --> 01:16:02.72
as opposed to you know an hour and forty seven minutes of slides that are of you know

731
01:16:03.92 --> 01:16:10.24
asset matrix for the you know he knew represented thirty man hours of power point work

732
01:16:10.24 --> 01:16:16.08
to make the arrow move the point behind that was and I saw this in the Pentagon all the time

733
01:16:16.08 --> 01:16:19.92
I wouldn't be surprised if you saw some of this in the EA world working in you know with

734
01:16:19.92 --> 01:16:26.000
animals in general is we create this thing where we are we this is how the boss wants it

735
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.40
and so we give the boss what he wants and some of the bosses are pretty they don't want to go

736
01:16:30.40 --> 01:16:34.64
down their mic manager people so they kind of tolerate it and we convince ourselves this is what

737
01:16:34.64 --> 01:16:39.20
the boss is looking for someone to do what make most of our bosses don't actually want this

738
01:16:39.20 --> 01:16:42.88
they just want to make sure they know that you know what you're going to go do to go get it done

739
01:16:42.88 --> 01:16:48.32
and the least amount of time it takes to make him comfortable that you know the plan is actually

740
01:16:48.32 --> 01:16:52.32
what he wants and I remember putting these briefs together and I'd get these templates to go

741
01:16:52.32 --> 01:16:56.80
brief these generals up in the top floor of the Pentagon it was a big thing you've got 19 minutes

742
01:16:56.80 --> 01:17:01.76
could submit this calendar and we go in there and for the first couple briefs we'd have

743
01:17:02.56 --> 01:17:05.60
47 pages and he go hey can you just skip to the summary slide?

744
01:17:05.60 --> 01:17:13.76
Okay okay okay okay hey that may hey bolt through what do you mean by that?

745
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:16.88
Hey sir we're talking about this okay cool awesome hey I hate to do it you guys I got to get

746
01:17:16.88 --> 01:17:21.92
going thanks but I'm good at your plan go execute they didn't want any of that garbage but we

747
01:17:21.92 --> 01:17:26.40
fall this template we are so sure that they want it most leaders really just want to know that you

748
01:17:26.40 --> 01:17:32.80
understand yeah and they want to understand the wave tops of what's happening so they understand

749
01:17:32.80 --> 01:17:38.000
I had this guy I was putting a I was putting a group through Landwater Fair and this guy gave

750
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.96
a brief when it was horrible and long and freaking too detailed and covered stuff that didn't

751
01:17:42.96 --> 01:17:48.72
matter to anyone in the room and they gave another brief that was you know not enough and you know

752
01:17:48.72 --> 01:17:55.28
skipped like basic contingencies and then he was kind of frustrated and he goes what do you

753
01:17:55.28 --> 01:18:02.64
what do you even tell me what a good brief is as if that was like a trick question you know

754
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:10.40
I was I thought about it for four seconds and I said a good brief is a brief where your mind

755
01:18:10.40 --> 01:18:15.84
understand what is going to happen and what to do during an operation that's a good brief

756
01:18:17.84 --> 01:18:25.68
and he was able to dial it in yeah this where in the jungle you might have forgotten that

757
01:18:25.68 --> 01:18:31.04
patrolling in the jungle an officer with considerable experience in the jungle patrolling gives

758
01:18:31.04 --> 01:18:35.92
this advice patrols are most likely to give away their presence in an area by their footprints

759
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:40.80
shine from the smallest metal surface such as a belt buckle or watch must be avoided

760
01:18:40.80 --> 01:18:46.000
a luminous watch constitutes a real danger and he noise such as talking coughing, spitting,

761
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.16
etc. must have to be treated with the greatest of all dangers a man on patrol must learn to move

762
01:18:52.16 --> 01:18:58.72
silently making every possible use of natural cover that's just old school stuff I got to

763
01:18:58.72 --> 01:19:06.88
feel something I was hunting it's like so happy to be moving quietly some more patrol tips

764
01:19:06.88 --> 01:19:11.20
positioning camouflage are more important than I learned in the states in training

765
01:19:12.64 --> 01:19:19.36
in training bear down on covering concealment bear down on avoidance of the blundering approach

766
01:19:19.36 --> 01:19:26.40
on patrols on fire maneuver which are equally important and I didn't read that well in training

767
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:32.48
bear down on covering concealment bear down on the avoidance of blundering approach on patrols

768
01:19:32.48 --> 01:19:41.52
on fire maneuver which are equally important size of patrols the tenant kernel

769
01:19:41.52 --> 01:19:47.52
w a walker tank destroyer battalion commander Tunisia which you know let's just face it

770
01:19:48.16 --> 01:19:55.20
you're getting a title tank destroyer battalion commander is right up there many men were lost in Tunisia

771
01:19:55.20 --> 01:20:04.08
by using squad patrols the Germans used stronger patrols and just gobbled them up a patrol should be

772
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:10.88
either a sneak patrol small enough to escape detection or a combat patrol large enough to fight

773
01:20:10.88 --> 01:20:18.88
its way out of difficulty never allow one man to go out alone you know what's interesting about that

774
01:20:18.88 --> 01:20:28.32
we don't want to be balanced right well it's not going to be balanced but what he's saying

775
01:20:28.32 --> 01:20:33.44
is like you either want to be small and maneuverable and quiet or big enough to fight

776
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:39.20
don't don't don't try and make the mistake of trying to do both he will just take out a squad

777
01:20:39.20 --> 01:20:50.24
plus then you're making a bunch of noise the difference between you know six guys and 12 guys

778
01:20:50.24 --> 01:20:57.04
is a massive difference it is a massive difference on a patrol it's a totally like when we go out

779
01:20:57.04 --> 01:21:01.68
out of the squad patrol in the in the sealed teams you know you got eight guys it's this tiny little

780
01:21:01.68 --> 01:21:05.68
thing and you can see everyone and then at night with no night vision you can see everyone

781
01:21:05.68 --> 01:21:12.40
happens there you when you take out a patrol it seems like you've got this just massive thing

782
01:21:12.40 --> 01:21:17.68
and when you take out a task unit patrol it's just breaking gigantic like they're gonna hear you

783
01:21:19.68 --> 01:21:24.40
don't make that mistake so this is one of those things it's like it's not a dichotomy either or

784
01:21:24.40 --> 01:21:28.32
one of those rare things yeah because normally we're saying hey you don't go to the extreme one

785
01:21:28.32 --> 01:21:34.08
side of the other right want to be balanced yeah this is kind of like falling to the trap of

786
01:21:34.08 --> 01:21:37.84
well I want them to be small enough to be light nimble but big enough where you know they can

787
01:21:37.84 --> 01:21:41.76
defend themselves and what you're gonna end up with is not small and light and not able to defend

788
01:21:41.76 --> 01:21:48.48
themselves right like not not big enough to fight yet not small enough to move yes it's kind of like

789
01:21:48.48 --> 01:21:54.000
a we you serve obviously it's kind of like when you judge waves right you're either too far

790
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.16
for it to crash on you or you just go 100% under the wave you know I'm saying otherwise it crashes on

791
01:22:00.16 --> 01:22:06.64
you either go over it or under it or it crashes way before it can hit you oh that's that's

792
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:12.000
a positive thing yes you don't want it to crash on you on yes you are gonna be in that want that

793
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.80
little middle ground you don't want to be in the in the zone of destruction yeah there it's own

794
01:22:16.80 --> 01:22:22.24
there's a movie called the North Shore the impacts on impacts on yeah so North Shore he covered that

795
01:22:22.24 --> 01:22:26.40
yeah it was like yeah you're like you don't want to be actually this guy turtle they mean you're

796
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:32.64
watching North Shore deeper no yeah Rick King anyway got from Arizona wins a tank surfing competition

797
01:22:32.64 --> 01:22:36.64
so he's like of course I'm going to the North Shore so he's kind of a tank destroyer

798
01:22:40.56 --> 01:22:46.96
in a matter of speaking yes unless tank waves are pretty small and tame you know the artificial

799
01:22:46.96 --> 01:22:50.88
waves in Arizona apparently so he goes to the North Shore and you know he kind of gets wrecked for

800
01:22:50.88 --> 01:22:56.64
a little bit anyway meets the sky turtle and turtle says if the wave is here don't be here because

801
01:22:56.64 --> 01:23:03.60
you're gonna get drilled classic climate so same deal in this maybe we should cover that movie on

802
01:23:03.60 --> 01:23:07.92
here just to get these make sure we pass on these lessons learned I'm just saying these concepts are

803
01:23:07.92 --> 01:23:09.68
everywhere that's that's the thing

804
01:23:11.84 --> 01:23:16.96
the next section is called infantry weapons goes through detail M1 rifle frag grenades

805
01:23:16.96 --> 01:23:21.20
the Thompson Sub machine gun the Browning our automatic rifle the light machine gun heavy

806
01:23:21.20 --> 01:23:30.80
machine gun 60 millimeter motor 81 millimeter mortar the 37 millimeter AT gun the 4.2 inch chemical

807
01:23:30.80 --> 01:23:36.24
mortar which was originally called that because it was originally made for firing chemical shells

808
01:23:36.24 --> 01:23:41.36
but eventually they adjusted it put HE in there but they still called it the uh so it goes through

809
01:23:41.36 --> 01:23:46.80
like really good kind of pragmatic details of on how to operate those weapons talks about

810
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:54.72
next sections about artillery we what's chemical mortar chemical mortar is what to fire well what

811
01:23:54.72 --> 01:24:00.64
they disguised it was was this is a smoke mortar so we're gonna shoot if we have to use smoke

812
01:24:01.52 --> 01:24:07.20
to you know cover movement or we want to disrupt the enemies ability to see we have a

813
01:24:07.20 --> 01:24:14.64
mortar for firing smoke but that was really so we could fire chemical weapons if we were going to

814
01:24:14.64 --> 01:24:21.84
use them like well like to hear nerve gas yeah like yeah like you're gonna die but we didn't do

815
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:27.44
that we ended up making an HE round high exposed just kind of a normal mortar round for it and they liked it

816
01:24:30.48 --> 01:24:35.04
section called mast fires through tenet kernel james infantry Sicily our division artillery

817
01:24:35.04 --> 01:24:40.48
was never out of support from more than five minutes throughout the whole campaign we've got a

818
01:24:40.48 --> 01:24:44.88
wonderful set of battalions in our division artillery and we have worked so closely together that

819
01:24:44.88 --> 01:24:50.16
there is much part of our outfit as our own battalions they kept they keep right up on our heels

820
01:24:50.16 --> 01:24:56.16
all the time and that is just what we've got to have I don't know what we could have done without them

821
01:24:56.16 --> 01:25:01.76
they leap frog their batteries continually and went into some of the damnedest positions I had

822
01:25:01.76 --> 01:25:08.000
ever seen and delivered the goods we just can't praise them too much they were always right there

823
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.48
when you needed them in one place where we couldn't get forward because the hi-nees were on

824
01:25:12.48 --> 01:25:17.68
superior ground and had us pinned down with rifle machine gun and mortar fire the division artillery

825
01:25:17.68 --> 01:25:24.80
mast nine batteries on them and plastered them with fifteen hundred rounds in less than 30 minutes

826
01:25:24.80 --> 01:25:31.12
we then walk through that position without a scratch and the German dead were all over the place

827
01:25:35.28 --> 01:25:44.16
teamwork infantry tank team captain putton in infantry Sicily the infantry should be given

828
01:25:44.16 --> 01:25:48.88
practical training in cooperation with tanks I don't mean the armored infantry they're part of the

829
01:25:48.88 --> 01:25:53.36
armored division work with them all the time I mean ordinary infantry like us I know our regiment

830
01:25:53.36 --> 01:25:57.92
didn't have any training with tanks in preparation for combat we just didn't know how to work with

831
01:25:57.92 --> 01:26:02.08
the attached tank unit when the dirt when the tanks came up to supporters after we had broken up

832
01:26:02.08 --> 01:26:07.12
the German attack we did not follow up the tanks properly as they went forward had we done so we

833
01:26:07.12 --> 01:26:12.24
could have cleaned out most of the battalion of Germans we had not been trained to work with the

834
01:26:12.24 --> 01:26:16.80
tanks and when we remained in position they went and we were mainly in position after they went

835
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:21.68
forward if we would have known how to go forward with them we could have done a much better job

836
01:26:21.68 --> 01:26:27.20
and could have gotten all the German vehicles and material after this experience we strongly

837
01:26:27.20 --> 01:26:32.40
recommend that all infantry be given practical training cooperation with tanks and action

838
01:26:32.40 --> 01:26:38.40
get the infantry men used to the tanks and how to fight together with them for me that's a

839
01:26:38.40 --> 01:26:43.04
a comment about training in general you know you can't expect people to do things that they've never

840
01:26:43.04 --> 01:26:46.48
trained to do so don't expect them to do things that they haven't been going to do if there's

841
01:26:46.48 --> 01:26:54.64
something that they need to know how to do it that they might have to do train them on it

842
01:26:54.64 --> 01:27:01.44
Colonel Perkins tank battalion commander Italy the rush to battle is the wrong idea

843
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:08.80
here we creep up each tank should Overwatch another tank each section should Overwatch another

844
01:27:08.80 --> 01:27:24.96
section each platoon should Overwatch another platoon Ranger training buddy system Lieutenant Colonel William O.

845
01:27:24.96 --> 01:27:33.84
Darby commanding officer of the rangers in Italy and I think everybody kind of knows what I say

846
01:27:33.84 --> 01:27:38.56
we said Lieutenant Colonel William O. Darby I know they at least think of the Darby Queen

847
01:27:39.76 --> 01:27:46.64
the the ranger off-school course in our work we always use the buddy system the men work in pairs

848
01:27:46.64 --> 01:27:51.76
they live in pairs even pairs do garden pairs even do kp in pairs confidence and jugglers developed

849
01:27:51.76 --> 01:27:58.64
they can pick their own buddy from within their platoon same thing in the seal teams day one

850
01:27:58.64 --> 01:28:03.92
you get a swim buddy and stick with them realism in our training we never do anything without battle

851
01:28:03.92 --> 01:28:09.12
noises and effects we always use live ammunition we use mines barbed wire and protective bands of

852
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:13.52
machine gun fire extensively if the problem is to capture a machine gun nest there's always a machine

853
01:28:13.52 --> 01:28:18.24
gun nest there with a machine gun firing in a fixed direction the men very quickly get a custom

854
01:28:18.24 --> 01:28:23.12
to having live ammunition flying around them capture the telling the German machine guns and

855
01:28:23.12 --> 01:28:27.60
machine pistols are used by the enemy in our problems that he's talking about the out for

856
01:28:27.60 --> 01:28:32.48
our men quickly learn to distinguish between the fire of our own weapons and that of enemy weapons

857
01:28:32.48 --> 01:28:38.80
also the enemy makes constant use of flares we always carry our normal load of ammunition with weapons

858
01:28:38.80 --> 01:28:43.28
loaded if a man knows his weapon is loaded he will be more careful in handling it an accidental discharge

859
01:28:43.28 --> 01:28:48.32
of a weapon automatically means a fine and immediate reduction to the grade of private

860
01:28:50.48 --> 01:28:55.12
in our work we must take drastic measures to guard against accidental discharge of weapons

861
01:28:55.12 --> 01:29:00.64
we learned our lesson in Tunisia where the accidental discharge of a rifle

862
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.32
cleared a raid and caused a 24 hour delay in operations so all kinds of good stuff in there and

863
01:29:09.28 --> 01:29:14.000
and I will say this so when I got the seal teams it was almost all live fire we did live fire

864
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.20
for everything and it gave you that kind of pressure and that kind of you you got a custom to

865
01:29:19.20 --> 01:29:25.76
machine guns and hearing them and you know round snapping overhead and you do you got used to it

866
01:29:25.76 --> 01:29:30.88
in fact there were days where they would put us down range and just shoot you know put put

867
01:29:30.88 --> 01:29:34.80
put you down range you'd go behind a berm or whatever you get in a safe spot and then they just

868
01:29:34.80 --> 01:29:39.92
shoot at you so you'd start getting used to like okay this is what different round sound like and

869
01:29:39.92 --> 01:29:43.92
you you know that happens even being in the butts at a you know on a normal range

870
01:29:43.92 --> 01:29:49.84
but that kind of realism is important here's the drawback the drawback is the enemy doesn't

871
01:29:49.84 --> 01:29:54.08
maneuver the enemy doesn't shoot back at you so when we started using

872
01:29:55.04 --> 01:30:02.56
simulation paintball laser tag systems that totally improved our tactical capability

873
01:30:03.20 --> 01:30:09.20
to an incredible amount the accidental discharge that's still a huge deal right oh yeah

874
01:30:09.20 --> 01:30:12.48
what is it now like them I mean they're they're talking about finding people and busing them

875
01:30:12.48 --> 01:30:18.72
down the private I mean it I think some of it depends on the circumstances you know if you have

876
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:23.68
an actual discharge in the seal teams it's going to be your careers your careers are the line

877
01:30:23.68 --> 01:30:28.72
you know if you if you have something like that happen it's not necessarily going to be over

878
01:30:29.44 --> 01:30:35.76
but you're going to have a real you're going to have to keep your hopes up they don't

879
01:30:35.76 --> 01:30:41.36
that you don't get so even like like a called AD right or AD

880
01:30:41.36 --> 01:30:49.12
AD and the which is a negligent discharge I think they are now I'm not like totally caught up on

881
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:57.36
the terminology of where it's at right now the and the just started coming around when I was

882
01:30:58.08 --> 01:31:04.56
sort of in my later years yeah I feel like negligent that's like careless in

883
01:31:04.56 --> 01:31:09.28
yeah so like an accidental discharge which to your point you can have a you can have a you

884
01:31:09.28 --> 01:31:14.72
can have around just cook off like you're out in the desert in Imperial Valley in California it's

885
01:31:14.72 --> 01:31:20.96
120 degrees out and you dump six mags on your last run and you're standing there your weapon

886
01:31:20.96 --> 01:31:25.60
is scorching hot and if there's around in the chamber it can cook off it can just shoot that's

887
01:31:25.60 --> 01:31:31.84
why you have your weapon painted pointed in this air direction at all times if that happened you

888
01:31:31.84 --> 01:31:36.40
you're not going to get I mean you know you're not really going to get trouble I mean is if everyone

889
01:31:36.40 --> 01:31:39.28
didn't have the weapon clearance if but when it's hot out everyone be like hey clearance if

890
01:31:39.28 --> 01:31:43.76
your weapons but you know we also used to have a command safe and let them hang which is just you

891
01:31:43.76 --> 01:31:47.68
just safe your weapon you just let it hang there so we've got a hot round and there it can cook off

892
01:31:47.68 --> 01:31:53.28
you're probably not you know you're not going to get in trouble for that most likely you occasionally

893
01:31:53.28 --> 01:32:00.56
a weapon will have some kind of a malfunction that will cause a problem what else can happen

894
01:32:00.56 --> 01:32:05.76
I feel like something like that like I've weapons malfunction the hot you know that's like

895
01:32:05.76 --> 01:32:09.76
an accident that's an accident that negligent is the kind like that's not I had my finger in the

896
01:32:09.76 --> 01:32:16.16
trigger yeah and you know somebody called a ceasefire and all of a sudden you know I kind of let

897
01:32:16.16 --> 01:32:20.40
my weapon hang when it's resting on my finger and I crack off around and they get a lot of trouble

898
01:32:20.40 --> 01:32:29.28
for that yeah interesting this is more on range of training physical conditioning one of our best

899
01:32:29.28 --> 01:32:35.20
means a physical conditioning is speed marching finally reaching a point where we march 10 miles

900
01:32:35.20 --> 01:32:40.96
at a rate of 6 miles an hour to keep in condition we use calcthenics in a daily 5 miles speed march

901
01:32:43.76 --> 01:32:51.12
discipline discipline aerodryals are all important we have a retreat formation daily

902
01:32:51.12 --> 01:32:56.56
conditions permitting at this formation the men are inspected and some manual of arms performed

903
01:32:56.56 --> 01:33:00.64
followed by retreat every Sunday morning there is a review followed by inspection in the ranks

904
01:33:00.64 --> 01:33:05.44
and then inspection of the camp or quarters we have at least four periods a week of closed order

905
01:33:05.44 --> 01:33:10.64
drill and manual of arms and one period every week devoted to military courtesy

906
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:17.36
infractions of discipline military courtesy and uniform regulations are dealt with quickly

907
01:33:18.24 --> 01:33:23.60
and severely the officers must bear down on these things the army in general has not stressed

908
01:33:23.60 --> 01:33:35.04
strict discipline enough without it you are lost yeah one of those things

909
01:33:37.28 --> 01:33:41.60
can you go too far with discipline Dave Burke yes you can absolutely

910
01:33:43.76 --> 01:33:48.32
I mean obviously don't know the background of that story but you know the version of the story he's

911
01:33:48.32 --> 01:33:52.32
talking about is the guys that could feel stripper weapon in the dark at night

912
01:33:52.32 --> 01:33:56.64
on the worst possible situations we had nine seconds to get that weapon back in action you need

913
01:33:56.64 --> 01:34:02.56
discipline and repeat and wrote and over you need that and then the flip side is exactly

914
01:34:02.56 --> 01:34:07.36
we started this whole conversation with if I just if I if you do it because you're scared of me

915
01:34:07.36 --> 01:34:13.36
and I tell you to do it because if you don't you're going to get punished sooner or later sooner or later

916
01:34:13.36 --> 01:34:18.80
that approach will fail and look I know with the context of the book is so it's driven by that

917
01:34:18.80 --> 01:34:24.80
first scenario but you absolutely can overdo it yeah and then you could be like John Basilone

918
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:36.80
Basil and you'd hear stories from guys that work with him and they absolutely loved

919
01:34:38.40 --> 01:34:45.12
doing the right thing drilling with those weapons he set the example he did it in front of

920
01:34:45.12 --> 01:34:50.40
them at night blindfold all those things he did all those things he did and he like they love

921
01:34:50.40 --> 01:34:58.08
doing it he was inspirational he didn't impose discipline on them he showed them and gave them

922
01:34:58.08 --> 01:35:04.72
the gift of self discipline which is far superior dude and thinking the mileage you get is if

923
01:35:04.72 --> 01:35:10.24
I've ever as a leader the discipline that you demand from your people and the punishment that might

924
01:35:10.24 --> 01:35:14.32
come from not doing it if you actually impose it upon yourself as well and hold yourself to the

925
01:35:14.32 --> 01:35:19.36
same standard as opposed to get out there and go do that and I'm gonna sit in here and I don't know

926
01:35:19.36 --> 01:35:25.44
watch TV or something that piece of it when you're talking about that discipline what you get

927
01:35:25.44 --> 01:35:34.16
when you hold yourself to the exact same standard as your people Basil section two field artillery

928
01:35:34.96 --> 01:35:40.40
morale effect the incestant firing of our artillery during the six week period

929
01:35:40.40 --> 01:35:45.52
produced contrasting effects on the nerves of our own troops and on those the enemy

930
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.32
our infantry often stated that having those rounds continually landing in front of them was

931
01:35:50.32 --> 01:35:56.48
one of the best morale builders especially at night in the jab on the other hand it produced

932
01:35:56.48 --> 01:36:04.48
severe cases of war neurosis he couldn't sleep at night because he never knew when or where

933
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:10.56
the next round was going to land he couldn't sleep in the daytime because when our infantry

934
01:36:10.56 --> 01:36:17.60
wasn't attacking him our artillery was giving him hell and this is nice the following statements

935
01:36:17.60 --> 01:36:22.96
made by prisoners are interesting so these are Japanese prisoners of which we know there wasn't

936
01:36:22.96 --> 01:36:31.84
a lot between the airport between be below hill and the airport we had many guns of all sizes

937
01:36:31.84 --> 01:36:39.44
before this campaign but now many of them are gone knocked out by artillery it is completely

938
01:36:39.44 --> 01:36:46.72
demoralized many units reduced many units in strength and has made many men go crazy

939
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:52.88
we were awakened at night by the slightest noise because of the bad state of nerves

940
01:36:53.44 --> 01:36:58.16
at night three men stayed in one foxhole two smoked while one slept

941
01:36:58.16 --> 01:37:04.40
during the day we also tried to get some sleep by alternating but the continual artillery fire

942
01:37:04.40 --> 01:37:12.72
kept us on edge and we got no rest even in the two story dugouts many men were killed just by

943
01:37:12.72 --> 01:37:18.40
concussion a direct hit would kill all the men inside the artillery is the one thing that is

944
01:37:18.40 --> 01:37:25.36
universally feared by all our ground troops it continues over such long periods of time and the

945
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:34.56
rounds come so fast except for the artillery we could continue our defense that's horror

946
01:37:36.64 --> 01:37:41.20
that's just horror

947
01:37:43.44 --> 01:37:49.60
section three miscellaneous booby traps seventh army report Sicily a German

948
01:37:49.60 --> 01:37:54.000
Luger pistol was booby trapped on a table new replacement picked it up two were killed and

949
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.44
14 were wounded in the resulting explosion there's another little set I wasn't going to read this

950
01:38:01.44 --> 01:38:04.88
but I'm going to read it a Luger pistol was found lying on the ground an American infantry

951
01:38:04.88 --> 01:38:09.20
lieutenant carefully tied a long court to it and then getting into a hole pulled it to him and

952
01:38:09.20 --> 01:38:14.56
put it in his pocket later in the day while examining the pistol he attempted to remove the magazine

953
01:38:14.56 --> 01:38:18.40
the explosion killed the lieutenant and two other men with six soldiers wounded

954
01:38:18.40 --> 01:38:25.04
the reason I'm reading that is because that was a freaking they set that thing up that's a that's a

955
01:38:25.04 --> 01:38:33.12
massive explosion from a small piece of from a small pistol timelyness of orders major

956
01:38:33.12 --> 01:38:38.24
kidney infantry are chief difficulty throughout the campaign was the lack of time given for the

957
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:43.52
execution of orders frequently received operations orders which did not allow enough time for

958
01:38:43.52 --> 01:38:50.72
proper preparation and execution at San Fratello we received an order after 11 p.m. to attack

959
01:38:50.72 --> 01:38:57.20
at six a.m. the next morning now when I read that I was like hey man that's kind of thinking

960
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:01.68
you all said I'll come up with a simple flexible plan no factor I got this what are they whining about

961
01:39:02.72 --> 01:39:08.96
read on the six battagans were assembly were in assembly areas some five or six miles

962
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:14.24
from the line of departure so even to get to where they were supposed to leave from the had to

963
01:39:14.24 --> 01:39:18.000
go six miles the terrain over which they had to move to get in position in the dark was the

964
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.36
roughest most rugged mountain country you can imagine and all ammunition weapons it supplies

965
01:39:23.36 --> 01:39:29.92
had to be taken by hand and by muelpack although it might seem that 11 p.m. to six a.m. was

966
01:39:29.92 --> 01:39:34.08
sufficient time the actual conditions were such that it was less than half done enough because the

967
01:39:34.08 --> 01:39:38.72
terrain darkness and transport difficulties also the men had just completed marches over mountain

968
01:39:38.72 --> 01:39:50.08
trails of nine to 14 miles and we're not fresh for the new movement maps seven th Army

969
01:39:51.52 --> 01:39:56.96
report Sicily instill an all personnel and appreciation of the value of maps the supply of maps

970
01:39:56.96 --> 01:40:03.92
will never be adequate to the demand training in the care and preservation of maps is as important

971
01:40:03.92 --> 01:40:10.80
as training in the care and preservation of material most important thing you need to know

972
01:40:11.52 --> 01:40:16.56
most important piece of information is where you are and if your map is destroyed have you

973
01:40:16.56 --> 01:40:22.32
received those old school silk maps yes things are legit they print them on silk echo trails

974
01:40:22.96 --> 01:40:32.48
because then they could survive I like this section this section is called room for improvement

975
01:40:32.48 --> 01:40:38.40
the following comments indicating weaknesses which must be corrected were made by the commanding

976
01:40:38.40 --> 01:40:44.88
general and they don't give the division I guess they're keeping it secret here we go sometimes

977
01:40:44.88 --> 01:40:50.64
units failed to dispose themselves properly for all round defense when halted on an objective or

978
01:40:50.64 --> 01:40:57.60
in place in position for defense so when you go into defense they're not putting themselves in the

979
01:40:57.60 --> 01:41:04.08
right positions next in the attack rifleman frequently failed to provide fire that would cover

980
01:41:04.08 --> 01:41:10.16
the movement of adjacent units merely because they were not able to pinpoint definitely the location

981
01:41:10.16 --> 01:41:16.80
of the enemy rifle and machine gun elements firing on our troops what does that mean that means

982
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:23.04
you fire where you suspect the enemy will be and that's something that infantry men and special

983
01:41:23.04 --> 01:41:28.40
operations people learn is if you don't know where the enemy has a new gunfight shoot where you think they

984
01:41:28.40 --> 01:41:39.36
might be this is perhaps one of my favorite things from this book some small unit commanders

985
01:41:40.24 --> 01:41:47.44
selected positions apparently with cover and concealment for themselves as the primary objective

986
01:41:47.44 --> 01:41:53.52
rather than positions from which effective fire could be brought to bear on the enemy

987
01:41:56.48 --> 01:42:01.20
and the last one due to the enormous division frontage in the second phase of the landing at

988
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:08.64
Soleno some company some commanders attempted to stretch their units excessively and as a result

989
01:42:08.64 --> 01:42:21.20
permitted faulty dispositions prioritize next here they go into some details on the Japanese

990
01:42:21.20 --> 01:42:29.52
overall and you know I've been reading the book and saying japs I know that's a derogatory term

991
01:42:30.40 --> 01:42:34.80
towards Japanese people I'm not referring to Japanese people I'm referring to the

992
01:42:34.80 --> 01:42:40.56
Imperial Japanese army members that were fighting against America and we're being referred to

993
01:42:40.56 --> 01:42:48.40
by their sworn enemy the Americans has japs Superman myth exploded that's the title of this

994
01:42:49.52 --> 01:42:56.40
operations report 43rd division new Georgia our troops here came to regard the superman stories

995
01:42:56.40 --> 01:43:04.16
about the Japanese as ridiculous the jap is tricky but not so tricky as many of lead

996
01:43:04.16 --> 01:43:10.96
been led to believe he is not he is not nearly so ingenious or adaptable as the average American

997
01:43:10.96 --> 01:43:17.12
and the truth of the matter is he's afraid of us of our artillery and of our sea and airpower

998
01:43:18.80 --> 01:43:25.84
our troops must learn this and never forget it yeah

999
01:43:25.84 --> 01:43:37.04
this is the last the last no and this it keeps some stuff about the Japanese as an enemy

1000
01:43:37.04 --> 01:43:42.24
and then it gives some stuff about the Germans as an enemy and this is the last one here

1001
01:43:42.24 --> 01:43:50.08
the last one from this book for part one of combat lessons minor tactics staff sergeants

1002
01:43:50.08 --> 01:44:01.92
Richard E. Deeland and Robert J. Camp infantry Sicily never let an apparently low machine gun

1003
01:44:01.92 --> 01:44:08.56
suck you into a trap the Germans will usually not fire on the individual but will wait

1004
01:44:08.56 --> 01:44:19.60
watch where he goes and get a whole flock and that's the last point in here and I think it's

1005
01:44:19.60 --> 01:44:24.48
it's not the last point in this whole book there's a few more but I think it's a good place to stop

1006
01:44:24.48 --> 01:44:32.88
and the reason why I think it's a good place to stop is because it's a warning it's a warning

1007
01:44:32.88 --> 01:44:37.20
about a trap it's a warning about a trap that the Germans use which is you know put it

1008
01:44:37.20 --> 01:44:44.32
what loan looking machine gun out there by itself oh that looks exposed and it seems real

1009
01:44:44.32 --> 01:44:48.56
obvious when you read it you're like hey if I see a but look too good to be true right this is

1010
01:44:48.56 --> 01:44:53.20
too good to be true this is the situation and so it's real obvious to anyone that's looking

1011
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:59.04
at it going oh that's too good to be true there's a right machine gun that's waiting to be taken out

1012
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:09.12
looks real obvious an obvious trap and yet the warning is there why is the warning still there

1013
01:45:09.12 --> 01:45:16.32
because people still fall for it you will still fall for it I will still fall for it we will all

1014
01:45:16.32 --> 01:45:25.20
still fall for that trap just like we will fall for the trap that we're good to go

1015
01:45:27.04 --> 01:45:32.56
that we know everything that we need to know that we understand everything that we need to understand

1016
01:45:32.56 --> 01:45:37.68
that we have reached our highest possible form

1017
01:45:37.68 --> 01:45:52.000
then all those little thoughts are a trap because we're not good then we don't know everything

1018
01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.32
we don't understand everything and we have absolutely not reached our highest form we all have

1019
01:45:58.32 --> 01:46:08.80
work to do so watch out for that trap because it is enticing it is enticing like a low machine gun

1020
01:46:08.80 --> 01:46:17.28
just gonna sit out there by itself waiting to be taken out and it's real easy to tell yourself

1021
01:46:18.80 --> 01:46:24.72
that you're good so here's a little warning for all of us especially me

1022
01:46:24.72 --> 01:46:29.60
we can't fall for that trap

1023
01:46:38.48 --> 01:46:39.44
well that wraps up that

1024
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.12
then the other notes Dave

1025
01:46:45.76 --> 01:46:49.68
no we addressed all of it that I wrote down and the whole lot more

1026
01:46:49.68 --> 01:46:59.28
you know there these lessons all those statements that comments the explanations

1027
01:47:00.88 --> 01:47:05.28
they all come from the same place as that trap they're all lessons learned the hard way

1028
01:47:06.24 --> 01:47:10.56
and as repetitive as they sort of sound they're all because all those are the same thing

1029
01:47:10.56 --> 01:47:15.04
I'm gonna say this over and over and over again because this keeps happening over and over and over again

1030
01:47:15.04 --> 01:47:21.44
it's in some ways it's it's heartbreaking but that is the reality is that even those lessons of

1031
01:47:21.44 --> 01:47:23.04
the things we're supposed to do come from

1032
01:47:25.52 --> 01:47:30.96
we had a saying an aviation they come they were written in blood they all came from a lesson

1033
01:47:30.96 --> 01:47:35.28
that's already been we already know that but we learned it the hard way and

1034
01:47:37.68 --> 01:47:43.68
you you you repeat yourself all the time and I don't mean that about you repeat yourself

1035
01:47:43.68 --> 01:47:47.44
we do it as shown for it we repeat ourselves all the time we take the same thing and then

1036
01:47:47.44 --> 01:47:52.000
try to apply the context to whatever world whatever company whatever business whatever problem we're

1037
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.12
dealing with but we're always saying the same thing because these lessons these lessons get learned

1038
01:47:57.12 --> 01:48:00.24
over and over and over again and the biggest

1039
01:48:01.92 --> 01:48:08.08
biggest thing that prevents us from making that lesson stick is what you just said is ourselves going oh

1040
01:48:08.08 --> 01:48:13.60
no I got it I've heard it enough I understand it and the minute you are convinced that you've

1041
01:48:13.60 --> 01:48:17.36
heard it enough and you've got it is when you're gonna learn the exact same lesson again

1042
01:48:20.80 --> 01:48:26.96
yeah it's weird how I mean this happens to us all the time in national and front

1043
01:48:28.96 --> 01:48:34.000
you you go we go into a company the companies in the game they're in the game they're

1044
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.72
they're telling me I mean there's definitely people it happens on the f-on line somebody

1045
01:48:38.72 --> 01:48:42.72
who brings something up and somebody like oh jockel podcast number 128 he talks about that

1046
01:48:43.60 --> 01:48:47.36
I don't know off top man but someone's answering that question in a millisecond right

1047
01:48:48.24 --> 01:48:54.80
people that know the material so we go into companies where they know they've read they know

1048
01:48:55.68 --> 01:48:59.12
they wrote memorized I guess no is a strong word right

1049
01:48:59.12 --> 01:49:08.72
but and I talked about this on the Darryl Cooper and I got to got into it a little bit

1050
01:49:08.72 --> 01:49:16.48
on the unraveling podcast because he was saying to me well how do you handle something when you know

1051
01:49:16.88 --> 01:49:25.44
that the other person's premise is wrong and you know he was pretty dug in and I said well

1052
01:49:25.44 --> 01:49:33.44
do you actually really know that because I'm not gonna approach anything if Dave Burke comes to me

1053
01:49:33.44 --> 01:49:43.68
and says hey jocco a UFO just touched down in my backyard I need support here ASAP

1054
01:49:45.20 --> 01:49:51.60
right not the split hairs but you mean extra terrestrial what did I say UFO okay yeah

1055
01:49:51.60 --> 01:49:56.80
UFO's just unidentified okay so he identified so he calls me up and says unidentified

1056
01:49:56.80 --> 01:50:01.68
extraterrestrial machine just landed in my backyard

1057
01:50:04.80 --> 01:50:11.44
do what do I say look I know that's not true or do I right you know what I say I say well what does it look like

1058
01:50:11.84 --> 01:50:17.28
what what sort of what sort of weaponry do you see do are they is they're covering element

1059
01:50:17.28 --> 01:50:24.08
can you extract from the aO until we can assemble a counter force to go after these guys right

1060
01:50:24.08 --> 01:50:29.60
I don't just say hey Dave shut up you know I hate bringing out I'm like that's a dumb example

1061
01:50:29.60 --> 01:50:36.32
right but it's really hard for me to think of something that I should say it's really hard it's not man

1062
01:50:36.32 --> 01:50:40.96
people think that they know stuff all the time and what I say on the F online the other day I said

1063
01:50:40.96 --> 01:50:47.76
you don't mistake your opinion for the truth don't mistake your opinion for the truth don't

1064
01:50:48.80 --> 01:50:55.84
mistake people don't mistake what you've heard and what you've said for the truth don't

1065
01:50:55.84 --> 01:51:01.04
mistake the way you've always done things for the truth don't mistake your perspective for the truth

1066
01:51:02.40 --> 01:51:06.40
and that is why when you speak the truth and you and I talked about this the other day Dave

1067
01:51:06.40 --> 01:51:10.64
when you speak the truth what you should do is speak the truth humbly replace

1068
01:51:10.64 --> 01:51:17.52
of humility. Speak the truth from a place of humility. That's how you speak the truth.

1069
01:51:17.52 --> 01:51:24.64
Because even when you believe something and you quote, no, it's right, there is a chance and you

1070
01:51:24.64 --> 01:51:29.60
need to open your mind to this chance that you are actually wrong and you didn't understand something.

1071
01:51:29.60 --> 01:51:37.28
You didn't understand a different perspective. And all those things, all those things of, you know,

1072
01:51:37.28 --> 01:51:43.04
thinking that you know, thinking that you don't make this mistake, all those things, thinking

1073
01:51:43.04 --> 01:51:48.24
that your opinion is the truth, all those things, those are all traps, those are all just traps.

1074
01:51:48.24 --> 01:51:51.84
And they seem so obvious when we're sitting here talking about them. And yet, day after day after

1075
01:51:51.84 --> 01:51:57.92
day, you see people fall into those traps. And so what's interesting is when we talk about these lessons

1076
01:51:57.92 --> 01:52:03.44
and where I was starting this little idea is that you and I work with companies all the time,

1077
01:52:03.44 --> 01:52:13.12
and they know the material. They can recite the material. And yet, they're caught up, they're not

1078
01:52:13.12 --> 01:52:18.56
detached and they're not executing correctly. And so one of the primary things and it's

1079
01:52:18.56 --> 01:52:24.000
great being an echelon front because when we come in, we are instantly, where do we are detached?

1080
01:52:24.80 --> 01:52:31.28
That's our function. So as soon as we just take them and we move them over to our position,

1081
01:52:31.28 --> 01:52:36.56
three feet and say, look at that meeting, look at how that meeting just went. Or, you know,

1082
01:52:36.56 --> 01:52:41.20
look at this, look at this, this, this, this task the way you put this out to the troops. Look at this.

1083
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:50.40
Just look at it. Does that sound like your micro managing? Does that sound like you're not

1084
01:52:50.40 --> 01:52:53.92
giving any ownership like, what does it sound like? If you read this and all of a sudden, people go,

1085
01:52:53.92 --> 01:52:59.36
well, so you've got to watch out for these traps in the world.

1086
01:53:01.68 --> 01:53:10.40
I'm going to say something that's a total contradiction. Because all these quotes, all these

1087
01:53:10.40 --> 01:53:14.56
lessons, all the things you were just reading about in that in this book or whatever this is,

1088
01:53:14.56 --> 01:53:23.04
this compilation of people's lessons that they've learned. I was thinking about how often these

1089
01:53:23.04 --> 01:53:29.28
things get repeated. And it's this idea of, hey, the minute you think you know these lessons,

1090
01:53:29.28 --> 01:53:35.20
the minute you think you, I know this is when you actually have the most amount of risk. And at the

1091
01:53:35.20 --> 01:53:42.24
same time of thinking myself, I wish I knew all this stuff at the very beginning of my career.

1092
01:53:42.24 --> 01:53:47.68
And to think about what I actually could have done with my time in the Marine Corps, if I knew this stuff,

1093
01:53:47.68 --> 01:53:55.28
and like to see the ultimate dichotomy of you never know this stuff, you have to learn it

1094
01:53:55.28 --> 01:53:59.76
over and over again. And if I just knew this stuff, how much better I would have been at what I was

1095
01:53:59.76 --> 01:54:11.92
doing. The broad understanding of it is what people, is what makes it hard for people to

1096
01:54:11.92 --> 01:54:18.56
understand a level where it can be utilized. Because I know for a fact that you were taught,

1097
01:54:18.56 --> 01:54:21.84
you know, hey, okay, when you're going through the basics, I was like, okay, you got this element over

1098
01:54:21.84 --> 01:54:26.16
here, they're going to put down a cut. You were absolutely taught that. I was absolutely taught that.

1099
01:54:27.12 --> 01:54:33.36
And yet I ended up having to teach this stuff to seals. Guys that have been in for 15 years,

1100
01:54:33.36 --> 01:54:38.32
20 years, be like, hey, why don't you put in some machine guns out on the flanks,

1101
01:54:38.32 --> 01:54:42.56
why you cross this road? Oh, that's a good old school thing. No, it's actually covered move.

1102
01:54:42.56 --> 01:54:47.36
This is a good basic thing that we do all the time. You know, and I'm not saying it every

1103
01:54:47.36 --> 01:54:57.76
seal, but I'm just saying seals that I've been in the Navy for a long time. And that's

1104
01:54:57.76 --> 01:55:01.44
what's so difficult about these things. And I was thinking about this the other day.

1105
01:55:01.44 --> 01:55:07.20
You start, okay, when you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do academy?

1106
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:14.08
And you, the more people that are at the academy and the better they get, it's like a pyramid.

1107
01:55:14.08 --> 01:55:18.96
If you're at the top of the pyramid, so Dean Lister is at the top of the pyramid at Victory MMA.

1108
01:55:21.04 --> 01:55:25.28
Every single time someone shows up new, they're a white belt.

1109
01:55:25.28 --> 01:55:31.12
Well, they show up here and they take their first class. That pyramid gets a little bit taller.

1110
01:55:31.12 --> 01:55:35.92
And Dean Lister gets a little bit better from one person showing up here. Because I one person's

1111
01:55:35.92 --> 01:55:39.52
going to train in a different way and he's going to prop up somebody else and that little

1112
01:55:39.52 --> 01:55:43.12
movement raises everyone up by a time he gets to me. I'm going up a little bit and then Dean's

1113
01:55:43.12 --> 01:55:48.40
going up just getting a little bit better. So what happens, I think is these ideas.

1114
01:55:48.40 --> 01:55:54.32
When you first hear them, they're just sort of there and you don't connect them.

1115
01:55:55.12 --> 01:56:01.68
And then as you start to connect them together, all of a sudden, well, not all of a sudden,

1116
01:56:01.68 --> 01:56:06.000
as you start to connect them together, they start getting taller and taller and taller and taller.

1117
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.84
And you start to see more connections. And really for me, this is, it does boil down to

1118
01:56:12.40 --> 01:56:17.44
what made me start to connect these things was jujitsu. In the fact that I could see

1119
01:56:17.44 --> 01:56:23.12
in jujitsu what I saw people supposed to do in the battlefield, those were the first two

1120
01:56:23.12 --> 01:56:28.72
connections that I made. And it's probably because I heard it somewhere. I'm sure somebody said,

1121
01:56:28.72 --> 01:56:33.36
you know martial arts are like combat. And what does that mean? Or whatever. But then I started seeing

1122
01:56:33.36 --> 01:56:40.56
the actual connection between the two. And then at some point, I started seeing that,

1123
01:56:40.56 --> 01:56:45.60
oh, those same things actually work in leadership inside of a team period. And now I'll

1124
01:56:45.60 --> 01:56:50.88
listen to everything looks connected. And now I'll listen when you start, when you, when you learn

1125
01:56:50.88 --> 01:56:57.44
to move in jujitsu, when you learn to move in a jujitsu and you don't know anything, that move is a

1126
01:56:57.44 --> 01:57:04.48
is a solitary thing by itself. It's unsupported in any way. You really can't even barely even

1127
01:57:04.48 --> 01:57:09.92
utilize that move because it's just by itself. You don't even know what position to get into.

1128
01:57:09.92 --> 01:57:12.88
You don't know how to get into that position. You don't know how to set it up. You don't know

1129
01:57:12.88 --> 01:57:17.28
anything. You know that move, but it's so easy to forget because it's not connected to anything else.

1130
01:57:17.84 --> 01:57:22.48
The better you get, the more knowledge you have, all of the sudden you start putting these things

1131
01:57:22.48 --> 01:57:28.08
together and now they become a system. Now they're all interrelated. And now when you see something,

1132
01:57:28.08 --> 01:57:33.84
here's something, it fits into, you see how it fits into this overall broad view of things,

1133
01:57:33.84 --> 01:57:39.36
which is why, you know, we constantly are quoting, if you see the way, if you see the way,

1134
01:57:39.36 --> 01:57:44.000
Broadway, you'll see it in all things. And that's what this is, but it takes a certain level

1135
01:57:44.88 --> 01:57:50.48
of understanding before you can see the way, broadly. And, you know, I talk to young

1136
01:57:51.44 --> 01:57:59.92
guys that are going in the seal teams and they just have no, this stuff isn't even on the

1137
01:57:59.92 --> 01:58:05.60
f- it's not even on the radar in any way shape or form. Right? And part of it is because they

1138
01:58:05.60 --> 01:58:09.84
don't see the seal teams, they see the seal teams. I was like, oh, I'm going to go make it through

1139
01:58:09.84 --> 01:58:14.80
buds and I'm going to go and, you know, I'm going to go run and we're going to shoot machine guns.

1140
01:58:14.80 --> 01:58:20.32
They don't understand what this profession is. And it's better now than it was. I mean, the

1141
01:58:20.32 --> 01:58:24.88
guys, when I came in, I didn't freaking understand any of this, definitely any way shape or form.

1142
01:58:24.88 --> 01:58:31.84
I better even understood what it meant to, okay, you're going to be part of this squad and this squad

1143
01:58:31.84 --> 01:58:39.84
has responsibilities to an overall, I barely grasp any of that. But as you start to assemble this

1144
01:58:39.84 --> 01:58:45.52
information, and so that's what's hard. So going back to working with the client, like until

1145
01:58:45.52 --> 01:58:51.20
you can start bringing things together for them. Until they start connecting these things in their

1146
01:58:51.20 --> 01:58:59.20
own head, that's another thing is I can sit there and with a ball-peen hammer hit you with one spot

1147
01:58:59.20 --> 01:59:06.88
and go cover and move, cover and move. Until you see that cover and move is connected to these other

1148
01:59:06.88 --> 01:59:13.76
things, it's very, very difficult to force the knowledge onto that onto another human.

1149
01:59:13.76 --> 01:59:19.76
Yeah. And I made the comment earlier about, I wish I knew these things. There's a whole bunch of

1150
01:59:19.76 --> 01:59:24.24
reasons why you simply can't at the beginning, just like you described. I guess the second lieutenant

1151
01:59:24.24 --> 01:59:30.96
Dave Burke almost can't know this, no matter how crystal clear these lessons are from World War II

1152
01:59:31.68 --> 01:59:42.80
and forever back. And the other side of that though is that even even when you can, it's still never

1153
01:59:42.80 --> 01:59:49.68
ends finding more to know. Dude, I taught it top gun. The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

1154
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:54.40
the, the, the, the apex of aviation and the pinnacle and all these things that we used to describe top gun,

1155
01:59:54.40 --> 02:00:02.16
this PhD level graduate level system of combat aviation top gun, you know what I was teaching there?

1156
02:00:02.80 --> 02:00:08.32
Cover and move cover and move and you know why I was teaching cover and move because the mistakes

1157
02:00:08.32 --> 02:00:13.52
that top gun made the students made to go through top gun were mistakes they weren't doing cover

1158
02:00:13.52 --> 02:00:20.40
move even at that level. The reason I was talking about simple plans at top gun, we didn't use

1159
02:00:20.40 --> 02:00:24.40
the same words, but I was teaching that same thing is because the plans weren't simple and nobody

1160
02:00:24.40 --> 02:00:27.20
really understood them and they go out and missions come back and hey, what, what did I scare

1161
02:00:27.20 --> 02:00:32.64
them? Well, this guy's in listen to me. Well, that could be it, but actually it's probably not,

1162
02:00:32.64 --> 02:00:37.44
what probably is it you did explain to very well. The reason I was teaching these same simple

1163
02:00:37.44 --> 02:00:41.52
fundamental things at top gun is that those are the mistakes that were being made repeatedly

1164
02:00:41.52 --> 02:00:49.04
by some of the best most experienced pilots in the world. And as I hear myself say, I wish I knew

1165
02:00:49.04 --> 02:00:57.04
this stuff and I'm not laughing at the phrase, know this stuff. It's crazy how even now that I know

1166
02:00:58.72 --> 02:01:05.28
it's so much more than ever new, what I really know is how little I still really know and how much

1167
02:01:05.28 --> 02:01:08.96
more that is out there and that's why every time you break out another book I'm like, do that book

1168
02:01:08.96 --> 02:01:17.84
was awesome even though saying he exact same things they're all saying. But that's actually

1169
02:01:19.68 --> 02:01:27.76
that's actually really good because we get to do this again. Yeah, we get to do it over and over again

1170
02:01:28.48 --> 02:01:33.36
and get to see it from a different angle and get to understand it a little bit deeper. Like when this

1171
02:01:33.36 --> 02:01:39.84
example comes in the pyramid goes up just a little bit more and it ties together another

1172
02:01:39.84 --> 02:01:50.24
little part of your brain and I often wonder, you know, there's some lessons that you cannot

1173
02:01:50.24 --> 02:01:57.60
teach to someone like they have to, they have to experience it, right? And there's unfortunately

1174
02:01:57.60 --> 02:02:02.08
a lot of lessons like that. Let's face it. Let's face it. That is the vast majority of lessons

1175
02:02:02.08 --> 02:02:06.32
because everyone, otherwise everyone would get issued a certain book in age 12 and here's what you

1176
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:11.20
need to know and they'd be like, oh cool, got it. Okay, save my money. Okay, eat healthy. Okay,

1177
02:02:11.20 --> 02:02:15.60
you know, because all these fundamental things that a human being could do that if you did all these

1178
02:02:15.60 --> 02:02:22.48
fundamental things and by the way, these are not hidden knowledge. These are common knowledge.

1179
02:02:22.48 --> 02:02:29.60
These are these are just common knowledge things that everyone kind of knows and yet we think it's

1180
02:02:29.60 --> 02:02:34.16
going to be different for us. We think we get, I don't need, I'm going to do it a little bit differently

1181
02:02:34.16 --> 02:02:41.44
and it's no, it's not going to work. No, it's not going to work. So taking these things and that's

1182
02:02:41.44 --> 02:02:46.000
what that's another good thing is you have to experience some, in some way you have to experience

1183
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:53.28
and that's one good thing that happens at echelon front is you are in an environment where you

1184
02:02:53.28 --> 02:02:58.40
get to use this stuff real world and that's been interesting, you know, sort of after the first

1185
02:02:58.40 --> 02:03:04.32
six weeks of the COVID lockdown, not even six weeks, the feedback we started getting was

1186
02:03:05.60 --> 02:03:11.60
from many of the companies we work with was this stuff really works and the reason that they were

1187
02:03:11.60 --> 02:03:15.44
saying is because they'd never really been tested in it before. Yeah, you know, they're doing

1188
02:03:15.44 --> 02:03:19.76
great, they want to do even better and now they go and do better and they go, wow, the stuff really

1189
02:03:19.76 --> 02:03:29.28
works, doesn't it? So hard to learn and the thing that makes it hardest to learn is if you fall into

1190
02:03:29.28 --> 02:03:36.56
the trap of I know it. I wish it was another, I'm familiar with it, right? There's got to be a lesser

1191
02:03:36.56 --> 02:03:41.92
form of I know because I know as a, there's a, that's a hundred percent. I know as a hundred percent.

1192
02:03:41.92 --> 02:03:49.60
There should be a lesser form of no, maybe I'm familiar with. I, I, I understand that

1193
02:03:49.60 --> 02:03:56.08
a decent level, some of the concepts that we talk about. This is not new to me. Yeah, this is not

1194
02:03:56.08 --> 02:04:01.68
new to me. That sounds a little bit. Is that a little bit kind of? Yeah, no, is it a little bit

1195
02:04:01.68 --> 02:04:08.96
arrogant? Yeah. Oh, okay. That's why that's kind of part of the gig. No, I'm looking for a word that

1196
02:04:08.96 --> 02:04:14.56
actually says, I'm very familiar with this, but I know that I have a lot to learn. We should

1197
02:04:14.56 --> 02:04:20.48
know that. Yes, I'm not sure. Okay. Yeah. The word for how I feel. The word for how we should all

1198
02:04:20.48 --> 02:04:27.92
feel. Yeah. Okay. I thought, which is I am striving to be better. I'm familiar. I know that

1199
02:04:27.92 --> 02:04:33.52
these things exist and I know that I don't, you know, like them, like basically seeing your

1200
02:04:33.52 --> 02:04:38.88
white belt at this. Yeah. And maybe it's like saying I'm a purple belt at this. Yeah. Which is

1201
02:04:38.88 --> 02:04:44.88
that I'm just on the path. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hoiler back in the day, long time ago, I did a website

1202
02:04:44.88 --> 02:04:50.24
form and he was at my house and it was me and kid polygroom. And it's and hoiler. What's up, kid? What's

1203
02:04:50.24 --> 02:05:00.000
up, hoiler? Yeah. And so we're me and kid, balie girl, we're lucky. And he said, hey, so we're looking

1204
02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.24
at it and he's like, hey, we're trying to integrate his enemy. We're doing some technical stuff,

1205
02:05:04.88 --> 02:05:08.000
so I'm doing this. I was like, okay, this is what you got to do. You got to do this, I think. And

1206
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:12.24
he's like, maybe if we did this, so we tried it his way, boom, and it worked. So it like, you know,

1207
02:05:12.24 --> 02:05:16.88
it's rendered on the screen. And hoiler's like, it's his website, but he doesn't know this part. He's like,

1208
02:05:16.88 --> 02:05:22.64
oh, I'm a white belt at this stuff. And it gave me that feeling that that you just mentioned.

1209
02:05:22.64 --> 02:05:27.84
I know, like it reminded me of that time. Kind of like he knows what's going on, but he has no

1210
02:05:27.84 --> 02:05:32.72
idea how deep it goes, you know, in the back end like that. Yeah. Well, there's that, there's definitely

1211
02:05:32.72 --> 02:05:39.60
that time period when you start your jitsu. And you, the first couple days, it takes a little while to go,

1212
02:05:39.60 --> 02:05:44.80
wow, I really don't know a lot, because in the beginning, you think it's finite. Yeah. That's the

1213
02:05:44.80 --> 02:05:51.12
big difference. Yeah. In the beginning, you think it's 13 moves. And then you go, oh, wait, it's actually

1214
02:05:51.12 --> 02:05:56.000
probably 35 moves. When I started a jitsu, I thought it was nine moves. That's what that was the whole thing.

1215
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:01.44
I didn't give me my black belt up in here. I know it's going to get America. I know the

1216
02:06:01.44 --> 02:06:08.64
gui-atine. I know the rear naked choke. I'm good. What? What? Give me my black belt. And then you get

1217
02:06:08.64 --> 02:06:14.96
really good at it. And the better you get, the more you realize, I don't know some stuff. I don't know

1218
02:06:14.96 --> 02:06:21.12
a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. I thought that way. And that's the way this is. That's the way this is.

1219
02:06:22.48 --> 02:06:25.44
And then you get the, and like I said, the biggest thing I don't watch out for is that trap.

1220
02:06:25.44 --> 02:06:33.84
And we got to avoid the trap and speaking of avoiding the trap and speaking of staying on the path.

1221
02:06:33.84 --> 02:06:40.88
Echo Charles, if we want to avoid the trap of complacency, complacency, we want to improve. We want to

1222
02:06:40.88 --> 02:06:46.24
get better. We want to be better. Recommendations. So complacency and how do I, you know,

1223
02:06:46.24 --> 02:06:51.68
where why does complacency come in as far as working out goes? Because you think you're good.

1224
02:06:51.68 --> 02:06:55.92
You think you're good to go or maybe you don't need it as much or whatever. Because here's a big one.

1225
02:06:55.92 --> 02:07:02.72
There's going to sound kind of offbeat. Maybe, maybe not. I don't know. But let's say you get married kids.

1226
02:07:04.16 --> 02:07:08.24
That's an easy one. But my favorite thing is when people tell me, oh man, I was really

1227
02:07:08.24 --> 02:07:12.24
in the G.J. 2, but I got two kids. Yeah. And I was just looking at them. I got four kids.

1228
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:20.88
What? Yeah. As if, well, I'm old. I've had people got me. I'm just all old now. Like, I will do

1229
02:07:20.88 --> 02:07:30.08
either like I'm 42. I'm like, right? But there's two. There's two kind of reasons or excuses or

1230
02:07:30.08 --> 02:07:34.72
whatever there when they're like, I got kids. That's either saying I don't have time. Well,

1231
02:07:34.72 --> 02:07:38.80
okay. So back to the working out thing when you, when you get after you get married. There's two

1232
02:07:38.80 --> 02:07:43.20
reasons. Kind of like, oh well, my focus is on something else now. They don't mean you like,

1233
02:07:43.20 --> 02:07:48.08
I don't really have time to do these extra curricular things. What I'm going to call it? And then

1234
02:07:48.08 --> 02:07:53.44
the other one is, I don't need to anymore. Because a lot of people that's kind of whether they

1235
02:07:53.44 --> 02:07:57.68
have it consciously or not, it's like, well, I don't need to necessarily be in great shape.

1236
02:07:57.68 --> 02:08:02.000
Because I already have a girl kind of thing because part of their reason is to attract a girl

1237
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.28
easy to insane. And it goes both ways. It's a two-way street, obviously. So that can be one of

1238
02:08:07.28 --> 02:08:11.68
the reasons for complacency. Like, I don't need to stay in shape that much. Most definitely.

1239
02:08:11.68 --> 02:08:16.24
Yeah, I don't need to lift heavy anymore. Not to say you should be lifting heavy, not to say,

1240
02:08:16.24 --> 02:08:20.48
you should it be. But I'm just saying that's a potential excuse. Seems like,

1241
02:08:21.20 --> 02:08:27.04
anyway lifting heavy or not, doing jiu-jitsu or not. Because some of us are not doing jiu-jitsu.

1242
02:08:27.04 --> 02:08:31.52
Not recommended, but those are the facts. Some of them. I mean, it's not recommended to not do

1243
02:08:31.52 --> 02:08:36.16
jiu-jitsu. Correct. That's a problem. But those are the facts. Some of the time, seems like saying,

1244
02:08:36.72 --> 02:08:42.80
well, last. Do you find it weird that I said here and say that these kind of connections that

1245
02:08:42.80 --> 02:08:47.84
opened the door to begin to understand some of this stuff came from this weird thing where you

1246
02:08:47.84 --> 02:08:52.32
roll around on the floor with another person and try and choke them. Yeah. It's kind of weird, right?

1247
02:08:53.04 --> 02:08:58.64
Yeah, you know, from maybe, yeah, from the outside, I can see that. But the inside, you're like,

1248
02:08:58.64 --> 02:09:04.88
probably this thing is just completely explaining jiu-jitsu. You know what's a weird parallel as well.

1249
02:09:04.88 --> 02:09:10.72
It's like lifting weights and just your human body. The human body, how it works is like the same thing.

1250
02:09:10.72 --> 02:09:15.04
It's like a team of systems. That's true. Doing one thing for the other, you know. And they have to

1251
02:09:15.04 --> 02:09:20.000
cover and move for each other. They got a adapt. It's like all this stuff. Anyway, it's painting

1252
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:25.60
human body. You need supplements. If you're going hard in the paint on the path, you used to say

1253
02:09:25.60 --> 02:09:30.56
supplementation. It was kind of one of your go-to words. And now you're gone back, you know,

1254
02:09:30.56 --> 02:09:36.40
now you're just saying like supplements. Yeah. Yeah. Does that sound more like marketing? I don't know.

1255
02:09:36.40 --> 02:09:41.76
I just was really used to you saying supplementation, which was not a normal thing to say. It seems

1256
02:09:41.76 --> 02:09:45.68
like maybe you're just sort of falling in with the norm. Maybe you got peer pressured. Maybe.

1257
02:09:46.48 --> 02:09:50.96
All right. Well, let's go back to supplementation because now they just said it. You're good now.

1258
02:09:50.96 --> 02:09:53.68
The way you just feel like you're back. I feel like you're back. I'm back.

1259
02:09:54.72 --> 02:09:59.92
Cool. Well, you saying it kind of brought it to light. Like, yeah, I kind of like how supplementation sounds.

1260
02:09:59.92 --> 02:10:04.88
You seem saying when you're on the path in the game, going hard, which we are, you know,

1261
02:10:04.88 --> 02:10:08.88
unless we're not on all the fun. Did you lift today? I did not lift weights today. I'm going to lift

1262
02:10:08.88 --> 02:10:14.88
your head. Yeah. Hardcore. Well, yeah. For sure. Till failure. Anyway, you joined sometimes. Take a

1263
02:10:14.88 --> 02:10:22.32
beating, right? Supplementation will help that. As Dave Berks has no factor. We got supplementation for that.

1264
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:27.36
Joint warfare, super-cryoteleïve, which I took both of today. I'm on the routine. Of course.

1265
02:10:27.36 --> 02:10:32.88
I got some help from you, obviously, but, you know, some people out on the interwebs, out on the field,

1266
02:10:32.88 --> 02:10:37.44
you know, they're demonstrating that they can stick to that routine, leaving it out on the, uh,

1267
02:10:37.44 --> 02:10:41.52
oh, did you make adjustments? Yes, sir. You got to bring your bathroom now? No. Where?

1268
02:10:41.52 --> 02:10:45.36
On the counter. In the kitchen. We're always come down. I always come down. Seems like.

1269
02:10:45.92 --> 02:10:50.000
But the last bathroom was just a no-go, non-starter. Well, you know, like to be eaten stuff

1270
02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:55.28
on your bathroom, even if just a little capsule. Given my current routine. Yeah.

1271
02:10:56.24 --> 02:11:01.92
I said, I said, go pills to be a little bright, little feel like a original thing.

1272
02:11:01.92 --> 02:11:07.44
And I don't like to take you. So there's that I didn't know this. There's a difference in a capsule,

1273
02:11:07.44 --> 02:11:13.12
which has the little coating. It's got stuff inside it. And it pilles like a hard thing, right?

1274
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:18.40
And they're a little bit harder. Swallow or whatever. I found the capsules are hard.

1275
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:24.24
Oh, really? I found it. Well, that's too bad. You're not in charge of a supplement company.

1276
02:11:26.08 --> 02:11:30.40
Because the original go pills that he made were, I said, hey, make these things. I want to,

1277
02:11:30.40 --> 02:11:34.72
you know, have this stuff in just a little bit, but making it, make it, you know, smaller. So

1278
02:11:34.72 --> 02:11:41.12
the whole story was, hey, man, you know this Dave, you don't want to, you don't have to drink a

1279
02:11:41.12 --> 02:11:46.32
drink before you go and present to a group for two, a half hours. Because you don't want to say,

1280
02:11:46.32 --> 02:11:51.28
hey, can I even hold on to a little bio-breaker? No. In fact, when people tell me,

1281
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:55.92
hey, you know why you're speaking, why you put water up here? And I said, if I drink,

1282
02:11:55.92 --> 02:12:01.52
if I have to drink during the next one hour, if I go hold on the second wall and presenting,

1283
02:12:01.52 --> 02:12:05.68
I need to take a drink right now. Because my voice is dry. If I have to do that, we got a problem.

1284
02:12:05.68 --> 02:12:12.16
I failed. You're not, you don't want to, you're not sitting there to see me drink. We're not drinking.

1285
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:17.12
Now if I'm a during the master, I'm on stage for six hours. Yeah, we're up there drinking and

1286
02:12:17.12 --> 02:12:24.40
chilling and whatever. Plus you guys are taking turns. Yeah. Yeah. But the, so the go pills,

1287
02:12:24.40 --> 02:12:30.64
I said, hey, man, I can't be drinking a drink, filling my bladder up wall. I'm, you know, before

1288
02:12:30.64 --> 02:12:35.84
I was, I don't want to have to stop. Can you make something compact, compressed? There you go.

1289
02:12:35.84 --> 02:12:41.04
That's the Dispongo in a pill format. Get that, get that mine.

1290
02:12:41.04 --> 02:12:47.92
A ranking. So just to be clear, the Displing Go is a pill or a capsule. It is a capsule.

1291
02:12:47.92 --> 02:12:53.28
Okay. So the original one that be little made was a pill, because that's what I had requested.

1292
02:12:53.28 --> 02:12:58.56
I told them the wrong thing. I didn't understand the difference. I don't know the language. Okay. So pill,

1293
02:12:59.20 --> 02:13:05.28
compressed, yes. capsule is a capsule that you can unscrew and take the powder out. Jell cap.

1294
02:13:05.28 --> 02:13:12.08
Oh, yes. Yes. So and divide them in those are gel caps. Yes. They are different. So the three

1295
02:13:12.80 --> 02:13:21.60
delivery methodologies. Just to be clear. Yeah. Okay. There you go. So nonetheless, these things will help you

1296
02:13:21.60 --> 02:13:27.44
on the path. Big time. Also, again, we mentioned the D3. Boom, that's it. Every, that's a daily.

1297
02:13:27.44 --> 02:13:30.80
Those are small too. So that's like kind of like no excuse. You know some people that like

1298
02:13:30.80 --> 02:13:36.40
I'm right. So I'm going to peel some people like that. This one, no factor. It's a gel cap,

1299
02:13:36.40 --> 02:13:42.56
which is our use. I used to take, I used to take pills one at a time. One, like so I would take

1300
02:13:42.56 --> 02:13:48.24
whatever seven or eight pills. Right. So you, I would take one. One. Why just, just, I just didn't like it.

1301
02:13:48.24 --> 02:13:52.80
Kind of like what you're saying. I was one of those people. And then I realized it was inefficient.

1302
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:57.68
It is. And I had to overcome this, you know, scenario. I'll tell you the technique to swallow pills.

1303
02:13:57.68 --> 02:14:02.24
You swallow 10 pills at once if you want. Well, I've never tried it, but I'm saying given the theory

1304
02:14:02.24 --> 02:14:07.92
theoretically. Because I, what do I take? And this is all I want. Two, two, two,

1305
02:14:07.92 --> 02:14:11.68
divitements. Oh, you take two of those? Yeah. I take, okay. Go ahead.

1306
02:14:11.68 --> 02:14:19.44
A three, acrylic oil. Three joint warfare. And everyone's on all, don't throw into cold war.

1307
02:14:19.44 --> 02:14:24.32
So what is that? Two, six. I don't know. I didn't do the math nonetheless. It's a lot. Let's say it's six.

1308
02:14:24.32 --> 02:14:28.24
Yeah, I take all those at once. Yeah. All you got to do is when you drink your water with it,

1309
02:14:28.24 --> 02:14:31.60
wait, you drink water with it? Yep. Yeah, that, you know, some guys are advanced. They just boom.

1310
02:14:31.60 --> 02:14:36.80
Yeah, that's one speed. That's an hardcore dude. Yeah. But we're not all there. So we're going to drink

1311
02:14:36.80 --> 02:14:41.76
our water with it. But, bro, all you do, some people, they lean their head back. Oh, here's the thing. When you

1312
02:14:41.76 --> 02:14:46.40
lean your head back like that, the narrowed, the goat chamber. No, well, I don't know, maybe

1313
02:14:46.40 --> 02:14:50.80
me not, but that's not what I found as far as feel. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

1314
02:14:51.20 --> 02:14:56.48
those capsules that you talk about, they float in the water. You want it to sink really,

1315
02:14:57.28 --> 02:15:02.88
the pills sink just if they're coated with something. God, it's like anyway. So if you go straight

1316
02:15:02.88 --> 02:15:07.76
up straight back, boom, the delcaps float sometimes they don't go, go down. Interesting. This is

1317
02:15:07.76 --> 02:15:15.20
what you do. You turn your head to the side. Okay. So you don't say it, no, because look, it's still

1318
02:15:15.20 --> 02:15:20.000
floats, but since it's to the side, it's in the side of your throat, not on the top of it. So it goes down

1319
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:25.44
easier. Five pills. I'm still doing every day. One speeder I was thinking, I knew how to take

1320
02:15:26.08 --> 02:15:31.44
capsules. Yeah. Now I learned the truth. I guess technically I shouldn't even say that's the best

1321
02:15:31.44 --> 02:15:37.52
one. So currently that is the leading way. My little daughter was getting sick. And I said,

1322
02:15:37.52 --> 02:15:43.60
hey, you need to take some cold water. And so then she does not like to take pills or capsules.

1323
02:15:43.60 --> 02:15:50.80
And I said, no problem. I am broken open, mix it up in water. It was wider. You cannot do this.

1324
02:15:50.80 --> 02:15:57.52
Because it is because there's garlic in there, like a lot of garlic, which is an awesome ingredient

1325
02:15:57.52 --> 02:16:04.64
to have. But man, I mixed it up and it was nasty. Try it with one just to cut it, just to cut it, see.

1326
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.36
That would be a that would be an exercise in discipline. Just mix up cold water pills and just

1327
02:16:11.36 --> 02:16:17.52
drink them like shots. Yeah. Man, I think maybe sprinkle a month of eggs or something. Some baking

1328
02:16:17.52 --> 02:16:21.92
or something. That might be actually interesting. Interesting concept. But that's the thing.

1329
02:16:21.92 --> 02:16:27.20
I'm sure cold water is not just garlic powder. Yeah, no, for sure. There's some like actual

1330
02:16:27.20 --> 02:16:33.68
that's when you mix it with water and smell it. You smell it. And then you take it off.

1331
02:16:34.56 --> 02:16:41.28
Well, nonetheless, however you choose to take these things, they will help you 100% in the game on the path.

1332
02:16:41.84 --> 02:16:45.12
I'm just saying, don't forget about milk protein, the form of these are protein,

1333
02:16:45.12 --> 02:16:50.80
additional protein. Not like you're not eating protein ever. If you weren't, it would be

1334
02:16:50.80 --> 02:16:58.80
bone now you are. Yeah. There you go. When else chocolate, yes, we're dead lifting.

1335
02:16:59.44 --> 02:17:04.08
But like we're not dead lifting. No, we're not. I should be dead lifting. We should be. I think so.

1336
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:08.64
That's my opinion too. Well, when it's chocolate, you have to do with that because it allows you

1337
02:17:09.92 --> 02:17:15.12
to deadlifate thousand pounds. Is it eight? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the guarantee. Could be right.

1338
02:17:15.12 --> 02:17:18.56
It could be more. If you go harder, I guess. And you get all this stuff at the vitamin shop,

1339
02:17:18.56 --> 02:17:26.24
the vitamin shop in your local A.L. Area of Operations. Yes, sir. Also at originmean.com. If you

1340
02:17:26.24 --> 02:17:30.16
don't want to go to the vitamin shop, you want the delivery system to your door.

1341
02:17:31.76 --> 02:17:37.12
And you go, yeah, originmean.com. Also at originmean.com is due to stuff,

1342
02:17:37.12 --> 02:17:45.28
geese, rash guards. There's t-shirts and other clothes or whatever, but more importantly,

1343
02:17:45.28 --> 02:17:51.84
actually not importantly, but additionally, significantly, additionally, genes and boots.

1344
02:17:51.84 --> 02:17:58.000
There's something else coming. You probably don't even know about because you're not really like,

1345
02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:04.40
you know, they're like, good relationship. It's in this circle. So, you know, the material

1346
02:18:04.40 --> 02:18:12.08
that the ghee pants are made of, it's called atomic twill. So, and it's durable enough to be

1347
02:18:12.08 --> 02:18:20.32
ghee pants obviously. And I was like, Pete, what do you think? I could use just a pair of pants.

1348
02:18:21.52 --> 02:18:28.08
So, he made them and they are freaking legit. Yeah, like work pants, but they're, yeah, they're basically

1349
02:18:28.08 --> 02:18:32.72
just pants, but they're not genes. Yeah, they're in jail. Yeah, they'll be coming. That'll be working.

1350
02:18:34.72 --> 02:18:39.60
Yeah, yeah. Yes, all made in America, by the way, which is a big deal. Fabric, cotton,

1351
02:18:39.60 --> 02:18:45.20
grown in America all the way to the, to the, to the deal. What about, what about, like, the things that

1352
02:18:45.20 --> 02:18:51.12
you put together to make them stay up? You know what I mean? There's a certain thing there. What's

1353
02:18:51.12 --> 02:18:55.76
that called? No, no, what you're talking about? What's it called? That keeps the two pieces of cotton

1354
02:18:55.76 --> 02:19:00.40
fabric together. What's it called? I don't know. Not a zipper. About the zipper is the,

1355
02:19:01.28 --> 02:19:06.88
what? The button. That's right. Yeah. The buttons. Yes, even the buttons are made in America.

1356
02:19:06.88 --> 02:19:11.92
Yeah, works of art. Really function and fashion. As a word. No less. What do you mean?

1357
02:19:11.92 --> 02:19:17.20
Duckcomps where you get all this good stuff. Also, we're going to getting good stuff. Wait, Dave,

1358
02:19:17.20 --> 02:19:23.44
how'd you like the Yajako Palmer? You're going to go go cam. I liked it. Is it, is it the top

1359
02:19:23.44 --> 02:19:28.80
of your list? Or you, because you're on a, what, tax average? What? Where we are? No hit on, on, on

1360
02:19:28.80 --> 02:19:34.48
tax average, but I was doing some traffic thunder. But now that, now that,

1361
02:19:34.48 --> 02:19:39.52
Palmer's in the can, that's number one. That was just just went to the top. Well, dude,

1362
02:19:39.52 --> 02:19:47.44
Palmer powders all I had. Yeah. And the thing about go is like, I get them, because I'm going somewhere.

1363
02:19:47.44 --> 02:19:51.52
I'm on the go. So I'm on time to mix up the powder all the time. The powder was like,

1364
02:19:51.52 --> 02:19:55.84
almost a treat almost like milk. Yeah. So I'm like, I got time here. I'm going to get crushed

1365
02:19:55.84 --> 02:19:59.28
ice. I'm going to get the powder. I'm going to mix it up. I got some time. And I'm going to just,

1366
02:19:59.28 --> 02:20:06.64
now, just done. Oh, dude. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with the Jako Palmer scenario. Like,

1367
02:20:06.64 --> 02:20:11.44
it's, you was kind of surprisingly good. You know, when you think, oh, yeah. Oh, I just do

1368
02:20:11.44 --> 02:20:18.48
you lemon cool. Nice. Nothing new. Hey, there's nothing new to me. Boom. Take a hit. The

1369
02:20:18.48 --> 02:20:23.68
song is greater than the song. What is it? The parts, you, you feel I'm saying, but anyway, it was

1370
02:20:23.68 --> 02:20:27.92
that sort of situation. It's good. Okay. Anyway, speaking of good Jako is a store,

1371
02:20:27.92 --> 02:20:30.96
called Jako Star. This is where you can get your teacher. It's Hats.

1372
02:20:32.80 --> 02:20:37.20
Other cool stuff on there that represent on the path. This Blinny goes freedom.

02:20:38.24 --> 02:20:43.68
Good. Take the high ground or the high ground. I'll take you all this stuff. You can find

1377
02:21:00.24 --> 02:21:07.20
well, I mean, the podcast, we don't have a bind to firewall. Paywall. Yeah, paywall. Right.

1378
02:21:07.20 --> 02:21:13.92
That's what everybody wants me to do. Yeah. Put a pod in the paywall. They, they, they want that

1379
02:21:13.92 --> 02:21:20.48
because all the podcasts are now the new media stuff. Yeah. So well.

1380
02:21:20.48 --> 02:21:26.88
They're doing levels of it. We don't want to do that. We just want to do what we're doing. Yeah.

1381
02:21:26.88 --> 02:21:32.08
And in order to do what we're doing a little support. It's nice on that one. Hey, if you,

1382
02:21:32.08 --> 02:21:37.04
and speaking of this podcast, subscribe to a check it out. Echo Charles thinks that's important

1383
02:21:37.04 --> 02:21:43.12
for me to say right now. I don't think it's unimportant. How about that? We also have another podcast

1384
02:21:43.12 --> 02:21:48.96
that's out right now. It's called the unravelling. The Jako unravelling podcast,

1385
02:21:48.96 --> 02:21:55.28
Dereau Cooper and me talking about things in the world and how things in the world, when you unravel

1386
02:21:55.28 --> 02:21:59.04
them, you find out where they came from, why they're happening and it gives you better understanding

1387
02:21:59.04 --> 02:22:03.84
of the things that are happening right now. Used to be called the threat. We had to change the name.

1388
02:22:05.20 --> 02:22:08.48
There's also ground to podcasts, which we haven't recorded a while, but we're doing it on the

1389
02:22:09.44 --> 02:22:14.48
warrior kid podcasts as well. No, forget about the warrior kid soap made by Aiden. Who's up there in a

1390
02:22:14.48 --> 02:22:22.96
farm taking goat milk at a young age with a running a business so that the entire world

1391
02:22:25.52 --> 02:22:32.40
can stay clean. We have a YouTube channel where Echo Charles is supposed to make videos

1392
02:22:33.84 --> 02:22:38.08
and he does sometimes. We'll say, sure. I'm not going to argue with the one.

1393
02:22:38.08 --> 02:22:48.40
Some of them have explosions. Music, some have music and other enhancements. Skeletons.

1394
02:22:48.40 --> 02:22:59.12
Sure. Fire. Tanks. Aircraft. Yeah. Unless some don't. Yeah. And everyone that thinks

1395
02:22:59.12 --> 02:23:09.12
that Echo Charles should put one Easter egg. One, there pleasant surprise into these three-hour podcasts.

1396
02:23:09.92 --> 02:23:16.32
Like when Dave Burke says a mortar exploded, there should be a mortar exploding in this room.

1397
02:23:17.20 --> 02:23:23.60
This momentarily. And then the conversation continues. A lot of people think that's what should

1398
02:23:23.60 --> 02:23:30.56
happen. So we all have a little bit of fun when we're watching a three-hour. Yeah. Well,

1399
02:23:30.56 --> 02:23:37.92
so I will keep exploring that as an option for sure. So one else. Oh, yes. Psychological

1400
02:23:37.92 --> 02:23:42.56
warfare. Don't forget about that one. Hey, when you don't feel like lifting, Brad, all of

1401
02:23:42.56 --> 02:23:48.000
me yesterday straight up didn't feel like lifting today. But I did. Yeah. But you already have

1402
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.04
psychology for for planning ahead on repeat. You know what I was doing? Yes. I do. No,

1403
02:23:53.04 --> 02:23:57.52
unfortunately. If you wanted in your head, maybe not a repeat. Maybe repeat for a little bit

1404
02:23:57.52 --> 02:24:02.80
in this I get it. Go to like wherever you can buy MP3's Amazon. You know Google Play All these places.

1405
02:24:02.80 --> 02:24:08.56
Get psychological warfare by Jocca Willing. What it is is Jocca will talk in your ear telling you

1406
02:24:08.56 --> 02:24:13.68
why you shouldn't skip the workout, why you shouldn't eat a donut, pound that donut or the whole

1407
02:24:13.68 --> 02:24:20.64
box or whatever. Another butter cookies. You know you get different. Oh, no, let's see. You know,

1408
02:24:21.20 --> 02:24:27.60
gently, pragmatically, logically bring you past those moments of weakness and boom, you get you get

1409
02:24:27.60 --> 02:24:33.84
stuff done. It's really good. 100% effective too. By the way. Flipside Canvas. If you want some kind of

1410
02:24:33.84 --> 02:24:39.84
message to hang on your wall, my brother Dakota Myers making it for you. All kinds of messages,

1411
02:24:39.84 --> 02:24:47.12
important messages. Check that out, flipsidecamus.com. Got some books. One of them was written by this

1412
02:24:47.12 --> 02:24:53.12
guy right over here. Dave Burke. The code. The code the evaluation of the protocols. What do you

1413
02:24:53.12 --> 02:24:57.84
got? What do you got Dave? Dave, it's still getting a ton of messages from troopers who are still

1414
02:24:57.84 --> 02:25:04.16
on the path and in the game. It's so legit to hear. Has something as small as this little wood

1415
02:25:04.16 --> 02:25:10.80
field guide? Yeah, field guide. We weren't really sure what to call. No, but it's been you. It's

1416
02:25:10.80 --> 02:25:16.16
useful. Yeah, which has been awesome. So keep those messages coming in. I love here. Yeah, this is like

1417
02:25:16.16 --> 02:25:20.000
one of those things where, you know, I called it like a reminder almost, but it's kind of like

1418
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.64
okay, cool. A reminder doesn't make that much of an impact maybe on your mind, but think about it

1419
02:25:24.64 --> 02:25:29.84
every day at the let's say at the end of the day, right? Most of us don't think every single day.

1420
02:25:29.84 --> 02:25:37.04
Most of us don't think, how do I do today? How did I do today in all these like critical areas

1421
02:25:37.04 --> 02:25:42.40
as far as like making an improvement in what you're even doing? Imagine if you were part of

1422
02:25:42.40 --> 02:25:48.96
anything and you never assessed that thing. Yeah. Doesn't even compute. Imagine if you wanted to make

1423
02:25:48.96 --> 02:25:53.44
something better. You would assess that thing and see where you could improve it. Now imagine that

1424
02:25:53.44 --> 02:25:58.96
the most important thing we have is our lives and people go through their whole lives without assessing

1425
02:25:58.96 --> 02:26:03.92
where they are, who they are, what they're doing, where they're going. Most important thing you need

1426
02:26:03.92 --> 02:26:11.12
to know on the battlefield is where you are. Yeah. Then you can move forward. Yeah. That's the, that's

1427
02:26:11.12 --> 02:26:16.32
the protocols in this book. It's funny like you know when you're like your kid and you're trying to like,

1428
02:26:16.32 --> 02:26:20.72
I don't know, make the football team right and then you have like try out switch it, you know, a day

1429
02:26:20.72 --> 02:26:26.000
or a week or what is sometimes a week or whatever and after every little session you like come home

1430
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.56
and you're like, how did I do how did I do how did I do? That's just for some intro mural football game.

1431
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:35.20
We're talking about life. Same same thing. You would think it'd be more obvious. You would think,

1432
02:26:35.20 --> 02:26:39.52
yeah, that book, that that book would just be, hey, this is, hey, what are you guys doing writing?

1433
02:26:39.52 --> 02:26:44.08
This is, there's, you know, there's this already exists. Yeah. What are you doing writing this?

1434
02:26:44.08 --> 02:26:50.000
It doesn't exist. Now it does. The code the evaluation protocols. They've Burke, leadership

1435
02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:56.80
strategy and tactics. What percentage of questions that you get in your constant leadership as a,

1436
02:26:56.80 --> 02:27:03.60
as a leadership instructor, as a leadership coach, as an executive coach, what percentage of

1437
02:27:03.60 --> 02:27:10.40
questions are answered that you have to answer that you could either answer on the fly and say, hey,

1438
02:27:10.40 --> 02:27:15.44
here's a good way to look at it or you could if you had an extra 14 second say, hold on a second,

1439
02:27:15.44 --> 02:27:21.76
go to page 237 and leadership strategy and tactics. What's the percentage? It's a big number.

1440
02:27:24.48 --> 02:27:28.64
I don't want to do the math. It's a big number. I don't want to say it's all there because that would be

1441
02:27:29.52 --> 02:27:36.64
that be a lot to say it's all there, but it's there. And if it's not exactly there, there's a version

1442
02:27:36.64 --> 02:27:42.24
of it that's there that will fit wherever you are. The other side of just just read that book.

1443
02:27:42.24 --> 02:27:49.28
Just read it and it's there. Yeah, I think what's good about that book is this stuff that

1444
02:27:49.28 --> 02:27:53.28
we're talking about today where you have to pull these other things and you kind of want to start

1445
02:27:54.16 --> 02:28:01.36
fitting them together. I think this that book is a good step of taking these various principles

1446
02:28:01.36 --> 02:28:08.40
and starting to see how they play into the world, which I think is a good thing. Yes, kids,

1447
02:28:08.40 --> 02:28:13.44
you might have kids, you might know kids, you might as well get them on the path.

1448
02:28:13.44 --> 02:28:20.32
Way of the warrior kid, one, two and three. Those are available. Those are helpful.

1449
02:28:21.04 --> 02:28:29.12
I'm telling you right now, if you could get a kid, these books, you are going to change the

1450
02:28:29.12 --> 02:28:34.96
trajectory of their lives. And I know that's an arrogant and an an an an an a bold statement to make,

1451
02:28:34.96 --> 02:28:40.88
but I hear it all the time from parents, from teachers and from kids themselves.

1452
02:28:43.76 --> 02:28:50.48
It's it's just just please just get it for the kids, get it for the kids. And then if you're

1453
02:28:50.48 --> 02:28:55.92
going to smaller kid, think about what it's like being a small kid, the world. You have to

1454
02:28:55.92 --> 02:29:00.24
contend with the world. It's a scary place. We have fears to overcome Mikey and the dragons teach

1455
02:29:00.24 --> 02:29:05.28
kids how to overcome fear. This point of course, freedom field manual, how to get after it

1456
02:29:07.04 --> 02:29:12.56
for adults and extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership, the fundamental principles of

1457
02:29:12.56 --> 02:29:15.92
combat leadership that we talk about all the time that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin.

1458
02:29:15.92 --> 02:29:20.64
We have Escelon front leadership consultancy. What do we do there, Dave? We teach leadership.

1459
02:29:21.92 --> 02:29:25.28
Now we help make the connection between all this stuff and the world that these people are

1460
02:29:25.28 --> 02:29:31.68
living in and it's the coolest thing in the world because I get to think about this stuff. We get

1461
02:29:31.68 --> 02:29:38.32
to think about this stuff all the time, just just completely awesome. Real world application. Yes.

1462
02:29:38.32 --> 02:29:44.96
On a daily basis, into a multitude of scenarios and the outcomes are always the same. It's like,

1463
02:29:44.96 --> 02:29:54.88
yes, we actually know what to do there. We can help you. Go to go to Escelonfront.com for that.

1464
02:29:54.88 --> 02:29:59.92
And look, you don't have to necessarily have us to come to you or you don't necessarily have to

1465
02:29:59.92 --> 02:30:04.80
come to us. We had to cancel one of our monsters that bummed a lot of people out, meet you, all of us.

1466
02:30:04.80 --> 02:30:14.88
We got bummed out. But this is this is 2020. We are online, EF online, all the stuff that we're

1467
02:30:14.88 --> 02:30:22.000
talking about when you need direct contact to help get through things, to improve your leadership

1468
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:29.76
capability, to improve your team's leadership capability, to get you all aligned. Go to EF online.com.

1469
02:30:29.76 --> 02:30:35.04
You might be thinking that, oh, that sounds like something where I'll go on there and

1470
02:30:35.36 --> 02:30:40.40
and watch a video about something. And you will go. You can go and watch videos. But you can also

1471
02:30:40.40 --> 02:30:46.80
come and ask Dave Burke a question. You can come and ask me a question. You can argue with me.

1472
02:30:46.80 --> 02:30:50.40
You can say, actually, Jockel, cover, move, didn't work from you in the situation.

1473
02:30:50.40 --> 02:30:57.68
I will gladly discuss this with you. That is what we are doing with EF online. So it's awesome.

1474
02:30:58.64 --> 02:31:04.24
What I'm going to say. If you talked about it, because we have a whole new platform right now for

1475
02:31:04.24 --> 02:31:13.36
EF online, good point. Yes. The feedback we're getting on that is how easy it is for people

1476
02:31:13.36 --> 02:31:18.64
out there to connect with us directly in real time. Not to talk theory, not to talk principle,

1477
02:31:18.64 --> 02:31:24.08
but to talk. I'm having this actual problem or can you help me? Yes, I can. And then we're getting,

1478
02:31:24.72 --> 02:31:29.76
we're getting feedback, we're getting sit-rubs. Sit-rubs. Hey, the thing you told me yesterday,

1479
02:31:29.76 --> 02:31:35.28
I just did it. It worked. Thanks. And if you haven't, you need to tell people about this,

1480
02:31:35.28 --> 02:31:40.80
because the EF online access is so legit. It's growing quickly. But it's growing because

1481
02:31:40.80 --> 02:31:44.88
one of the other cool things about it is that we'll get a question. We'll get a question like

1482
02:31:44.88 --> 02:31:50.48
little chat box. Dave, got a question. But I'll be answering another question. Before I get to that

1483
02:31:50.48 --> 02:31:56.96
next question, five other people, other troopers have said, hey, had the same problem at my job.

1484
02:31:56.96 --> 02:32:00.88
This is what I did. And by the time I go to answer it, five of the troopers have already

1485
02:32:00.88 --> 02:32:05.68
engaged and helped them and given them some, so the interaction between the other troopers

1486
02:32:05.68 --> 02:32:08.96
is just as good as the interaction with us. Yeah, and all that stuff is taking place. We have a

1487
02:32:08.96 --> 02:32:13.68
forum in there too. So all that stuff, you can go in there and say, hey, my boss just told me to

1488
02:32:13.68 --> 02:32:19.84
do this. This is what I think. And you know, one of us EF instructors or one of the other troopers,

1489
02:32:19.84 --> 02:32:25.28
you know, oh, you know what? I'm in HR. I'm the HR chief at my company. Here's what you should think

1490
02:32:25.28 --> 02:32:30.48
about. So it's just an awesome format. It's an awesome thing. And even though we had to cancel one

1491
02:32:30.48 --> 02:32:36.16
monster, we do, we are going to do the Phoenix Monster, September 16th and 17th, Dallas, December

1492
02:32:36.16 --> 02:32:40.40
third and fourth, go to extremeownership.com for details. Look, it's probably going to be social distancing.

1493
02:32:40.40 --> 02:32:43.92
We're not going to have a bunch of seats or we're going to have to get, we have to put away a bunch of

1494
02:32:43.92 --> 02:32:49.84
seats. So it's going to sell out quicker than normal. So if you want to come check it out, say,

1495
02:32:49.84 --> 02:32:56.48
P, we got EF Overwatch and we are placing some awesome people from the military into executive

1496
02:32:56.48 --> 02:33:01.28
leadership positions and leadership positions throughout the country and awesome businesses,

1497
02:33:01.28 --> 02:33:07.12
people that companies that want to have folks that understand the principles that we talk about here,

1498
02:33:07.12 --> 02:33:14.40
go to EF Overwatch.com, whether you need leaders or whether you are a leader, leaving the military,

1499
02:33:14.40 --> 02:33:20.000
let us know and we will connect you. And then America's Mighty Warriors.org,

1500
02:33:20.80 --> 02:33:29.60

1501
02:33:29.60 --> 02:33:38.08
gold star families all over the world. If you want to get involved with her, she is getting after

1502
02:33:38.08 --> 02:33:45.76
it and she has been for 14 years and if you want to help out or get involved, go to America's

1503
02:33:45.76 --> 02:33:57.20
MightyOrriers.org. And if you want some more of my hyped up hypotheses or you want to hear more

1504
02:33:57.20 --> 02:34:07.84
of Echos semi-serious speculations, maybe you just want to hear one more of Dave's stringent

1505
02:34:07.84 --> 02:34:14.48
stories. Then you can find us on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram and on Facebook,

1506
02:34:14.48 --> 02:34:21.04
Dave is at David R. Burke. Echos out of which I was an I am at Jocca Willink and thank you to all

1507
02:34:21.04 --> 02:34:29.20
the men and women in uniform throughout history who learned these lessons in blood and pass them

1508
02:34:29.20 --> 02:34:38.16
onto our modern warriors who put them to use, put these lessons to use to keep peace in the world

1509
02:34:38.16 --> 02:34:42.64
and to police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers

1510
02:34:42.64 --> 02:34:48.24
and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service. Thanks to all of you for making

1511
02:34:48.24 --> 02:34:59.52
sure we have peace here at home and to everyone else out there, remember these lessons and first

1512
02:34:59.52 --> 02:35:06.08
and foremost remember how this book started that the Paramount Combat lesson learned from

1513
02:35:06.08 --> 02:35:16.24
every operation is the vital importance of leadership. Aggressive and determined leadership is the

1514
02:35:16.24 --> 02:35:25.44
priceless factor which inspires command and upon which all success in battle depends.

1515
02:35:28.64 --> 02:35:35.28
Leadership is responsible for success or failure so don't fall into the trap.

1516
02:35:35.28 --> 02:35:49.12
We are not good enough go out there and be better. And until next time this is Dave and Echo and

1517
02:35:49.12 --> 02:36:06.96
Jockel out.
