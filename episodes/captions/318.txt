00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.32 This is Jockel Podcast number 318 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Winning. Good evening,
00:00:06.32 --> 00:00:16.40 I come good evening. The Native Americans believed that if you gave someone a diagnosis,
00:00:18.64 --> 00:00:25.04 it was a curse. It was a curse that can become an identity.
00:00:25.04 --> 00:00:37.84 If you accept it, but a rewiring can happen. When you realize that you are the one creating
00:00:37.84 --> 00:00:45.68 your own experience, this is a long and truthful conversation with yourself.
00:00:45.68 --> 00:00:58.000 How can we learn and evolve from our successes and our failures? Where do we need to change?
00:01:01.12 --> 00:01:08.48 How can a person find solace and sovereignty in the face of experience that has been
00:01:08.48 --> 00:01:16.80 shaped by such pressure, immense hardship, bad choices, chemical manipulation, digital stimulation,
00:01:16.80 --> 00:01:20.32 and sophisticated programming that teaches you to kill.
00:01:25.84 --> 00:01:32.64 When the antiquated ways fail and repeat the same answers and produce the same results,
00:01:32.64 --> 00:01:44.000 it's time to change. You are not the victim of this life, but rather the victim of your
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.52 own choices. Truth is found within oneself, but to get to that truth, you have to peel back
00:01:53.52 --> 00:02:02.88 the layers to who you are. It's self-work and self-knowing that creates profound change.
00:02:06.64 --> 00:02:13.36 Today we have an addiction problem. We are addicted to other people's ideas. We become the victim
00:02:13.36 --> 00:02:20.80 of our experience. We take magic pills or become convinced by false profits as to what will
00:02:20.80 --> 00:02:28.32 fix us or make us happy. We just want to relieve hurt and make it go away,
00:02:30.24 --> 00:02:40.16 but running from pain only magnifies the pain. We are born to honor what is good while striving
00:02:40.16 --> 00:02:50.56 for our highest self. You have to be open to everything and close to nothing. The heat, the cold,
00:02:50.56 --> 00:03:01.60 your weaknesses, failures and successes, your loss and your regrets face them. Face yourself.
00:03:01.60 --> 00:03:08.56 This is the most important and difficult battle you have ever been in.
00:03:12.32 --> 00:03:19.28 Alexander the Great once said, bury me with my hands out of the ground so the world can see
00:03:19.28 --> 00:03:33.60 that I left it with nothing. That is the plan. You change your own life from within, always from
00:03:33.60 --> 00:03:46.72 within, never outside. It's 100% in you. Life is not here to punish us, but it's here to help us grow
00:03:46.72 --> 00:03:58.40 in wisdom and knowledge and to ensure we never again are a victim of life. The time is now.
00:04:04.88 --> 00:04:13.60 That is a compilation of words that I put together that were written by or spoken by or implied
00:04:13.60 --> 00:04:23.92 by a man by the name of Micah Think. I think you are going to see that through his path in life,
00:04:25.20 --> 00:04:31.28 in boyhood, in business and war and combat and service and sacrifice, it's allowed him to learn
00:04:31.28 --> 00:04:41.04 some valuable lessons and his goal is to teach those lessons. If not the lessons themselves,
00:04:41.04 --> 00:04:46.96 then at least teach other people how to learn those lessons, how to rewire themselves to be
00:04:48.80 --> 00:05:00.16 who you want to be, to be who you can be. We are lucky enough to have Micah with us here tonight
00:05:00.16 --> 00:05:08.96 to share some of those lessons. Micah, thanks for coming by, man. Thanks, buddy. Man,
00:05:08.96 --> 00:05:18.16 I was intense. Yeah, you've got a bunch of clips out and stuff that you've written on your website
00:05:18.16 --> 00:05:23.04 and I just pulled from some of it and watched from your videos and pulled from some of that
00:05:23.68 --> 00:05:29.04 to try and give people a feel for sort of where you're at, but in order to get to where you're at,
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:35.60 I guess we started at the beginning. Yeah, where have you been? Yeah, where have you been? So,
00:05:35.60 --> 00:05:46.80 where did all start, man? You know, I kind of always started, I was just a small town kid from
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:50.88 upstate New York and I laughed because if you were to tell me when I was a kid that
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.72 I'd be doing the things that I'm doing today, I would have, I'd probably would have been over the
00:05:56.72 --> 00:06:04.08 head of the frying pan. I just, I feel really fortunate to, you know, to now be in a place where I can,
00:06:04.08 --> 00:06:11.60 I can take the experiences in my life that at a point did break me down and now kind of show people
00:06:11.60 --> 00:06:16.08 that those experiences of the greatest ally that they have and this journey of self-discovery
00:06:16.88 --> 00:06:23.12 that were all on and I grew up, my dad, you know, grew up tough family, you know.
00:06:24.80 --> 00:06:32.24 My dad was, you know, seven dollars and sisters and grandpa was a mob guy and so he was in federal
00:06:32.24 --> 00:06:38.96 prison for ten years and were you alive then? No, no, it was. So this is before you were born.
00:06:38.96 --> 00:06:44.48 Yeah, it's before I was born and but he had a tough life and so he grew up as an orphan on the streets.
00:06:44.48 --> 00:06:50.64 This is your dad? My dad's dad. My grandfather. Well, I was super close to. He died when I was 16
00:06:50.64 --> 00:06:57.20 and I was really close to him. He was a hard man and he grew up as an orphan and
00:06:57.20 --> 00:07:01.92 and ended up turning his life around. I guess you could say much later in his life. He came
00:07:01.92 --> 00:07:08.08 the head of the railroad union and you know. My dad always tells the story when their life
00:07:08.08 --> 00:07:12.88 kind of started straightening out and fast-forward a little bit. My dad said they used to go back.
00:07:12.88 --> 00:07:17.76 He was an engineer in the railroad and I said he used to go back and abuse my grandfather.
00:07:17.76 --> 00:07:22.56 He'd run all these card games, you know, hustling and doing this at that and my dad would come back
00:07:22.56 --> 00:07:27.36 and say, PAH, what are you doing back here? I thought you were a Christian and he's like, you can't
00:07:27.36 --> 00:07:34.08 gamble and he's like, well, with me it's a sure thing. So it's not again. He was a card counter,
00:07:34.08 --> 00:07:39.04 even cow cards, but you know, so it's like real blue collar family, railroad family and
00:07:39.84 --> 00:07:43.52 you know, my dad, my dad grew up in that kind of life. Some of grandfather's pretty severe guy
00:07:43.52 --> 00:07:48.40 and the spirit. So did your dad grow? Did your grandfather live in all someone upstate or was he
00:07:48.40 --> 00:07:53.12 down the city? So he was upstate, he was in the city and then family moved upstate New York and then
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.48 mother and father died of alcoholism and then I think nine nine of the brothers and sisters
00:07:58.48 --> 00:08:02.80 were street kids. Basically they were orphans and then my graph archepic escaping and
00:08:04.40 --> 00:08:08.88 my her fact he broke his leg as an orphan was taken back to the home had to get surgery and
00:08:09.68 --> 00:08:14.80 you want to talk about having it rough. They circumcised them and he was 10. The dog, yeah, he's an orphan
00:08:14.80 --> 00:08:20.16 kid so they brought him in there. They just like, yeah, I'll give a little sniff. But yeah, so it was
00:08:20.16 --> 00:08:25.44 an interesting kind of upbringing because my dad grew up and he went to the 82nd Airborne.
00:08:25.44 --> 00:08:32.40 I always either go to prison or go to Vietnam type deal and my dad was a really, really rough guy.
00:08:33.60 --> 00:08:40.000 He's the epitome of a tough guy, like a real tough, like a violent tough guy and he wound up in
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.48 prison and he wound up in the end worth and what was this before you were born? Yeah, then so this
00:08:46.48 --> 00:08:51.36 was before I was born. My mom and dad had been together since 15 or 16. My dad had to join the military.
00:08:52.48 --> 00:08:56.80 Did he go to Vietnam? Well, he was supposed to go to Vietnam but then he wound up going to prison.
00:08:57.76 --> 00:09:04.32 Which Vietnam might have been better. But yeah, he never had that balance in his life, you know.
00:09:04.32 --> 00:09:10.72 And you know, it's interesting. My mom and dad, I think 56 years or something they've been together.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.32 But yeah, my dad went to 11th worth and he got some trouble in the military, of course,
00:09:16.32 --> 00:09:20.80 and he was riding with all the bike or gates stuff like that. I mean, he doesn't, every tooth
00:09:20.80 --> 00:09:24.40 my dad's had to have been punched out. He's got hundreds of stitches across his head and
00:09:25.44 --> 00:09:31.04 you know, he kind of just he had a rough and he hit rock bottom and he got out and he ended up
00:09:31.04 --> 00:09:36.64 becoming a Christian and then so he's prison time was in the military. Yeah, he was 11th worth.
00:09:36.64 --> 00:09:42.48 Yep. Yep. So he went to 11th worth and how long was he in 11th worth for a couple years?
00:09:43.36 --> 00:09:49.36 And then after that it was whatever dishonorable discharge most likely. Yeah. And then he got out and he just
00:09:51.36 --> 00:09:55.44 took a bus back basically. So he owed a bunch of money to
00:09:55.44 --> 00:10:01.04 like the hell's angels and those kind of guys. So they like took everything when he went to prison,
00:10:01.04 --> 00:10:07.44 robbed and blind basically. And so he got out with nothing. And you know, when I was a kid,
00:10:07.44 --> 00:10:12.000 like my Christmas is first spent like in the city missions, you know, every single Christmas
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000 we were in the slums and the hoods. We had people at my house, like straight out of prison. Like
00:10:16.72 --> 00:10:19.52 my dad, he's always telling me I was a kid. He's like, you know why I come here? He said
00:10:19.52 --> 00:10:24.88 I come here because I never want to forget where I came from. And my mom said that when my dad
00:10:24.88 --> 00:10:29.36 wouldn't she met me at a van 56 panel van that said no hope without dope. He could never
00:10:29.36 --> 00:10:37.36 figure out why you have getting pulled over all that time. But like so he was a rough guy. And
00:10:37.36 --> 00:10:42.40 my fact I know because as a kid people would come up to my dad, I wouldn't believe that, you know,
00:10:42.40 --> 00:10:49.04 it was him. And he was he was a violent human being. And they're kind of person has nothing to
00:10:49.04 --> 00:10:55.84 lose. And he was tough and he was a boxer and he was a street fighter. And so yeah, so my dad gets out
00:10:55.84 --> 00:11:00.08 and he ends up becoming a walking down the street like lowest point of his life. And he sees like the
00:11:00.08 --> 00:11:04.000 windows open and a church and the lights on and he decides he's going to walk in there and he sits
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.60 in the back. The ZZ top looking guy. He looked at the pictures. He's got the huge beer with the, you know,
00:11:09.60 --> 00:11:16.16 the Jaguar 87 patches on it, you know, rats and stuff. And tattoo is yet like Jesus smoking pot and
00:11:16.16 --> 00:11:24.88 his arm. Man, all kinds of crazy stuff. And he has an experience like in that church and nobody talked
00:11:24.88 --> 00:11:28.08 to him. Like nobody would even come up to him and they just looked at him like, well, this is a
00:11:28.08 --> 00:11:33.68 scary guy. And he turned his life around right there in that moment. And so I was born in
00:11:33.68 --> 00:11:40.72 79. My sister was born in 77. And my dad had to figure out how to put his life together. So my
00:11:40.72 --> 00:11:46.64 grandfather got him hooked up on the railroad and I ended up becoming an engineer and working on the
00:11:46.64 --> 00:11:52.56 railroad through till I was in second grade and then he started a church in a really rural town of
00:11:52.56 --> 00:12:01.36 600 people. So we're real poor when I grew up. We all live in the same bedroom. So how many brothers
00:12:01.36 --> 00:12:06.48 and sisters were one sister? Just the one sister? Just the one sister. Yeah. And this is still an
00:12:06.48 --> 00:12:11.52 upstate New York. Yeah. And then they started doing tent revivals. So when I was like, I always tell
00:12:11.52 --> 00:12:16.72 people, I'm like, listen, I, at the time I had become, and I'm not a religious guy. But I had become,
00:12:16.72 --> 00:12:21.04 I would get saved like pretty much three to four times a week. I've been, I've been saved more
00:12:21.04 --> 00:12:25.84 than any human being in North America because you would hear these guys and they would start preaching
00:12:25.84 --> 00:12:31.92 another crescendo would build. And the worms in the hell. And I'm like, I'm like, you know, I've been
00:12:31.92 --> 00:12:36.48 kind of touching my penis or something. I'm like, I should have been kidding. I would just be
00:12:36.48 --> 00:12:42.40 at my hand up. And I was like, I moved my way up to the blanket guy where I went into people
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:47.60 would fall down. I'd rush in with the little blanket laid over them, which a lot of them are
00:12:47.60 --> 00:12:52.000 faking because I was like, man, these people kind of just fall down and like before they even
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.36 get up there, sometimes they would just, they would get over the power or whatever. So I'd have
00:12:55.36 --> 00:12:58.40 these little blankets, you know, like seven or eight years old, I'd run up the blanket and I'd
00:12:58.40 --> 00:13:04.56 always like step on their finger and they'd be like, hey, all right, like, so then I was like,
00:13:04.56 --> 00:13:09.84 sorry, questioning things. I really, I really did. So I question things. They're such as they'd
00:13:09.84 --> 00:13:14.08 push you down on the ground. But that was a crazy experience. You know, we traveled all around.
00:13:14.08 --> 00:13:17.68 Was it all around the country you travel or just like skating your. Up. Okay. I'm
00:13:17.68 --> 00:13:22.24 skating your arc, you know. So it was, remember the 80s it was kind of a wild time for that kind of
00:13:22.24 --> 00:13:26.24 stuff that people would get the laughing spells and like, you know, there was all these kind of
00:13:26.24 --> 00:13:32.96 things going on. And so I ended up, uh, I didn't even home at 16. So I, and I lived in my own from
00:13:32.96 --> 00:13:39.92 that on. Where'd you move to? Kind of moved around the country. Uh, and, uh, yeah. So I ended up
00:13:40.72 --> 00:13:46.000 moving down South Florida and getting a job down there and working and what were you doing in South
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.56 Florida? Uh, my grandmother lived down there. And I lived, uh, I was homeless for a little while.
00:13:52.56 --> 00:13:57.04 I was homeless for some months down there. And, uh, I got, you know, I've gotten in some trouble.
00:13:57.04 --> 00:14:04.24 I was also a very rough kid as you could imagine. I... The thing about that whole movement,
00:14:04.24 --> 00:14:10.32 looking back now retrospectively is, is the guilt and the fear and all the things that are associated
00:14:10.32 --> 00:14:15.20 with that. And we're movement. Yeah, the revival movement. And all that kind of stuff. And it
00:14:15.20 --> 00:14:20.72 wasn't ever about love, you know, and I mean to me, like, that loving yourself and not judging
00:14:20.72 --> 00:14:24.48 yourself and all those kinds of things. It wasn't associated with that at the time. And so,
00:14:24.48 --> 00:14:28.88 as soon as I got old enough, you know, around 15, I, uh, well, I started working at 10.
00:14:29.68 --> 00:14:36.32 And, um, yeah, my first job in a dairy farm and then my time on as 14 years old, I was working 35,
00:14:36.32 --> 00:14:42.88 40 hours a week, sometimes. Um, and that was kind of my life. Where are you going to school?
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:46.88 Yeah, let's go into school. So I get off school. Sometimes I work to 10 o'clock at night. I work
00:14:46.88 --> 00:14:52.16 all the weekends, work Sunday after noon. Um, and then I started working for our family as a
00:14:52.16 --> 00:14:56.72 lineman. First, I was like, pick up the sticks guy, you know, I'd run around and move the trucks and
00:14:56.72 --> 00:15:01.12 do all these things. And then, um, slowly, anything to get off the dairy. I don't really drink milk
00:15:01.12 --> 00:15:10.80 because of that. Um, milk is a disturbing product. Like, it is, I don't, sorry, like, new
00:15:10.80 --> 00:15:15.60 horizon organics or whatever, but it's nasty. Like, it's a nasty thing. You know, like, on
00:15:15.60 --> 00:15:19.92 my job was to clean the others and stick these little suckers on there and, you know, like,
00:15:19.92 --> 00:15:24.96 these old bags kicking in and then, shitting on you. And it's the worst thing. And then the melt goes in
00:15:24.96 --> 00:15:29.60 there. And it's the flies and the cats lick it and stuff everywhere. And then these things got to be
00:15:29.60 --> 00:15:34.16 like constantly, you know, kept the pregnant. You know, so they're like in this perpetual state of
00:15:34.16 --> 00:15:38.80 pregnancy to get them to keep lactating, you know. And the only thing I wanted to do is just get the
00:15:38.80 --> 00:15:44.88 hell away from it. So, yeah, I ended up, uh, ended up becoming a lineman. So I learned I do line
00:15:44.88 --> 00:15:50.64 work, beat start climbing telephone poles on about 13. And uh, start making like good money doing that.
00:15:50.64 --> 00:15:56.32 So, um, I didn't do that down in Florida. I did a bunch of other things. And then, uh, I
00:15:56.32 --> 00:16:02.88 asked like, like, oh, yeah, that was a really, really rough time in my life.
00:16:02.88 --> 00:16:07.12 Uh, my effect, we were just down in Florida. And I was driving through some of the areas that you
00:16:07.12 --> 00:16:11.84 still live in. I could remember being so hungry, like, going in the grocery store and just
00:16:11.84 --> 00:16:17.84 then like, just like grabbing like food and just like seeing like the big fat security guy, like
00:16:17.84 --> 00:16:23.44 just looking at me like, and I would do the whole, like kind of like Julio Jones like, you know,
00:16:23.44 --> 00:16:29.04 and you just, I'd make it out with like one tent of what I had. Like, and I remember this particular
00:16:29.04 --> 00:16:34.08 package of sausage that I had. Um, when were you hanging around with? What was that? What was
00:16:34.08 --> 00:16:40.40 going on? Uh, I ended up, uh, I've had met some guys when I was younger and, um, that were kind of
00:16:40.40 --> 00:16:45.68 passing through. They were like street guys. And at the passing through upstate New York. Yeah.
00:16:46.72 --> 00:16:51.44 They're like selling shit and, you know, kind of rough crew. And so I actually showed up at their house.
00:16:52.32 --> 00:16:57.60 Uh, in Florida. Yeah. And I was, you know, I was in some, I wasn't some pretty big trouble at the
00:16:57.60 --> 00:17:04.40 time. And, uh, I, uh, I was, I wasn't living at home at all anyway. And so I moved down there and
00:17:04.40 --> 00:17:12.40 I stayed down there until I was 20. And, and then I moved back home. I had like 30 grand on me and,
00:17:12.40 --> 00:17:18.80 and I saw all kinds of stuff and I moved back home with a, with a stripper girlfriend. I got that
00:17:18.80 --> 00:17:22.000 out of my system. So when I got the stripper, we've been in the team. So I was like, I got a boy's,
00:17:23.52 --> 00:17:30.08 I was there when I was 17. Don't do it. And yeah. So I, I moved back home. My life was kind of like
00:17:30.08 --> 00:17:35.76 an entailspin. Honestly, I, you know, had money, had things and I had a real hard chip in my shoulder.
00:17:35.76 --> 00:17:43.04 And I just, uh, you know, I had kind of become like my father, I guess in the sense where I was,
00:17:43.04 --> 00:17:48.40 I could be violent. I was pissed off. I was just angry. Once your dad found like God,
00:17:48.40 --> 00:17:56.08 was he still pissed off in angry? No, but inversely he was really hard. He was a hard man.
00:17:56.08 --> 00:18:01.68 Like hard. You know, I didn't, I never looked at God as like God has loved and he wants to like
00:18:01.68 --> 00:18:06.000 care for us in Jesus with the lamb and stuff. You're like Old Testament God. Old Testament God,
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.28 like, I'm like, I'm gonna take the staff. Those are the stories I heard. You know, like the
00:18:09.28 --> 00:18:14.08 what you'd ever hear. You're like, Jesus just loves everybody. Like, if you listen to him,
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:18.40 like worms are gonna come suck your brains out and you're gonna burn an animal in by the way. Like,
00:18:18.40 --> 00:18:23.28 I mean, I mean, it was like that. That was the, was the revival day. Is it was the fire and
00:18:23.28 --> 00:18:30.96 brimstone? And so I was afraid of it to be honest. And I didn't like the whole thing. I didn't
00:18:30.96 --> 00:18:36.000 like the hypocrisy and the whole movement and stuff. And so as soon as I got old enough, you know,
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.72 I had a bunch of money. I had worked my whole life. That's what I did. I had put my head down. I worked.
00:18:40.72 --> 00:18:46.88 I worked really hard. And that's kind of all I knew. I was like excessive compulsive worker.
00:18:46.88 --> 00:18:51.92 And you know, when I left, I was on my own. I had like, I had no like balance in my life.
00:18:51.92 --> 00:18:59.20 So yeah, I moved back home. I started doing mine work again. And actually, what big turning point for
00:18:59.20 --> 00:19:06.48 me was that I, I went on a backpack and trip on myself. And I ended up kind of having this experience
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:10.72 out there with a bear. It was like a little backpack, whatever. And I kind of just started like thinking
00:19:10.72 --> 00:19:16.80 about my whole life. And, and how I just wasn't ready to die. I wasn't ready to, that there was
00:19:16.80 --> 00:19:21.60 something else missing. And I walked out of there. And I literally, after that moment, I kind of changed
00:19:21.60 --> 00:19:25.68 my whole life. It was nothing religious. But what was, what were you out of? In the Adirondex.
00:19:26.48 --> 00:19:32.24 Yeah, kind of where I grew up going to all the time. And so yeah, so I ended up getting back on the
00:19:32.24 --> 00:19:37.36 line crew, climbing telephone poles again. And now I look back like when I was a teenager,
00:19:37.36 --> 00:19:40.96 working on these line crews, I would spend the summer is living in New York City. And I was
00:19:40.96 --> 00:19:45.76 living with a grown man that were shooting heroin and you know, living in these, they would put
00:19:45.76 --> 00:19:51.20 me up in these hotels. And I would live in these with these guys that were like vagrants, you know,
00:19:51.20 --> 00:19:55.20 they were, they were like, they would travel from a city to city on these huge contracts. And I would
00:19:55.20 --> 00:20:01.36 be down there for the weekend. Yeah, that was a, that was tough, you know, because that was a kid
00:20:01.36 --> 00:20:05.36 matter of fact. I remember there was a guy I'll never forget on my one say his name. He's probably dead.
00:20:05.36 --> 00:20:11.12 Now, but he was like six foot eight. He was the scariest guy I was from Long Island. His brother was
00:20:11.12 --> 00:20:16.32 another gigantic dude. And they were the heaviest people I've ever seen in my life. Okay, I've never
00:20:16.32 --> 00:20:22.88 seen men that hairy in my life. I'm telling that you. And then these guys were like, these guys were like,
00:20:22.88 --> 00:20:29.76 fucking Lebanese butchers. Like, and they had the deepest voices. And I get put on a splicing crew
00:20:29.76 --> 00:20:34.72 with this guy. And I remember I'm, you know, I'm 16. It's right before I laughed. I'm living in the city.
00:20:34.72 --> 00:20:38.16 I'm living with all these guys. And of course, they would never give me a bad idea in the corner.
00:20:38.16 --> 00:20:44.16 My little like sleeping bag, you know, and they'd be doing their things. And I remember this guy
00:20:44.16 --> 00:20:49.04 would never talk to me. And he would always flick his cigarettes at me. And he was just constantly smoking
00:20:49.04 --> 00:20:55.44 pot all of a sudden. You're 16 at this point. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm down there with this guy. I'm like,
00:20:55.44 --> 00:21:00.16 he has a van, like a white, like murderer van filled with all his cable stuff. And his heads like
00:21:00.16 --> 00:21:05.52 touches the ceiling. And he'd always be like, he always called me loser or fuck me. Whatever. Like any
00:21:05.52 --> 00:21:09.28 name, it's ever my name. He would call me. They have the deepest voice he's covered in hair.
00:21:09.28 --> 00:21:16.72 And I remember we're in Long Island. And I mean, most kids are like playing basketball. And they're
00:21:16.72 --> 00:21:21.52 out there like trying to like, you know, make out with their girlfriend, like, high school prom,
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:27.60 like, I'm there with this dude, Jim. And I remember we're in Long Island. I'm like setting the
00:21:27.60 --> 00:21:32.80 cones up or whatever. And I'm not doing it fast enough or good enough. Everything's getting paid by the units.
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:39.12 And I remember he's like, he's in the bucket above. And he just looks at me and he starts swearing
00:21:39.12 --> 00:21:42.72 at me. And he takes like a bolt and he throws it down. He hits me in the side of the head with it.
00:21:42.72 --> 00:21:46.56 And I had an hard head and like, I mean, it rang my bell. He can do that away on him too.
00:21:46.56 --> 00:21:51.36 Yeah. So he just like whips it down. Like, boom. Like, and I like, remember like rocked back.
00:21:51.36 --> 00:21:55.28 And I like, I went around the side of the truck and I started like kind of crying. I was like,
00:21:57.92 --> 00:22:03.04 so then I like, I just snapped. And so I started like taking all the cones. I started screaming.
00:22:03.04 --> 00:22:07.04 I'm throwing them into the road and cars like laying on their horns. This isn't your kind of like,
00:22:07.04 --> 00:22:11.44 and then I run over and I grab their emergency controls and the bucket. And I'm like,
00:22:12.48 --> 00:22:16.08 and he's like flopping shit. It's coming everywhere. And he's screaming, I'm going home.
00:22:17.68 --> 00:22:23.68 And I'm like crying. I'm like, I'm like, I'm pushing all the tools on the ground. I'm throwing everything everywhere.
00:22:23.68 --> 00:22:28.08 I kicking the truck. I'm going crazy. So finally after like 30 seconds of going crazy,
00:22:28.08 --> 00:22:34.08 and the control is I can see his like, this dude's going to murder me. So he just like stands up when I stop.
00:22:34.08 --> 00:22:42.24 And he's like, you're dead. You're dead. He says to me. And I'm like, so I just grab a huge pipe off the thing.
00:22:42.24 --> 00:22:45.52 And I'm like, and I'm out the road. And I'm just bawling my eyes out and I'm like,
00:22:45.52 --> 00:22:53.84 I'm on my screaming. And he's like, he's like coming down as little bucket out. I'm the tears and people are laying on their horns.
00:22:53.84 --> 00:23:00.48 And shit's everywhere. He looked at me and he's like, he gets down like just like at a reach from me.
00:23:00.48 --> 00:23:04.56 And I'm hitting the truck. I'm like, you're dead. He like, any problem would have killed me.
00:23:05.28 --> 00:23:08.08 And then he just like looked at me. He's like,
00:23:10.24 --> 00:23:13.04 any way back up. He made a good decision. And I was like,
00:23:13.92 --> 00:23:17.68 so he's like, pick up everything. He piece of shit. He says to me, like,
00:23:17.68 --> 00:23:22.16 it's so I'm out there picking everything up and sure enough, like I got to live in the house with the guy.
00:23:22.16 --> 00:23:26.32 So I like, you know, I go back the weeks over. And of course we go back up. You know,
00:23:26.32 --> 00:23:33.28 he was like nothing happened. You know, when I would ride back up there and he would just be like smoking like joined after joining listening to the lead Zeppelin.
00:23:33.28 --> 00:23:35.44 He would like look at me and he'd get done it. You go,
00:23:36.72 --> 00:23:39.92 like flick it at me and like hit my pants and I'd brush it off and he'd like,
00:23:41.20 --> 00:23:44.64 and he'd like, he'd like keep driving. So I mean, that was kind of like,
00:23:45.36 --> 00:23:48.64 you know, I was like joke about like, when I got in the military, like,
00:23:50.16 --> 00:23:55.36 I was already kind of like a, I wasn't afraid of much at that point. Like in the sense of like,
00:23:55.36 --> 00:24:01.28 I just had had had a lot of experiences and I had grown up on my own and grown up, you know, pretty rough. And so,
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.72 I'd end up starting my own mine crew and hiring some of my, to link with friends that I grow up with, you know,
00:24:08.72 --> 00:24:14.32 and, and I happen to be in Queens, New York. And at this point, I really did turn my life around.
00:24:14.88 --> 00:24:19.92 And I'm in Queens, New York when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. So September 11th,
00:24:19.92 --> 00:24:24.08 I go to the yards and Long Island. Pick up all my equipment. We used to store everything in these huge
00:24:24.08 --> 00:24:29.28 large yards just outside the city. And I'm gonna get some of this here. I got like,
00:24:31.44 --> 00:24:38.48 some coaches. And I get, uh, get all the stuff loaded up. I got the, we used to just go down there to be
00:24:38.48 --> 00:24:43.36 dude standing out the street and I was giving cash. So I've like, who needs a job? And I'm like,
00:24:43.36 --> 00:24:47.12 who's got a driver's license? I'm like, all right, 100 bucks get in and we'd hire like a ground guy.
00:24:47.92 --> 00:24:52.64 And, um, I was making big money at the time. And I bought myself like an Audi,
00:24:52.64 --> 00:24:57.28 which is not advised. Uh, wait, what? Is there something wrong with the Audi? Well,
00:24:57.28 --> 00:25:00.88 I mean, I didn't realize that when it broke, I couldn't afford to fix it like that. That was like,
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:04.48 and they do break. Who are your friends that you're hanging out with? Who's dudes?
00:25:05.12 --> 00:25:09.12 So like, I only really kind of ever had like the same friends kind of growing up.
00:25:09.12 --> 00:25:16.16 So the same crew from Catskill and down with you? Uh, the got, yeah. So they would work with me during the
00:25:16.16 --> 00:25:20.96 week. We'd live down there. We can say, go home. So we leave Sunday night at like three o'clock in the morning,
00:25:20.96 --> 00:25:25.12 or whatever. And then we'd be there to work Monday. And then we had a place that we'd rent.
00:25:25.12 --> 00:25:29.52 And we'd live down there, work all week, and then come back up. What do you want to ban or something, too?
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:34.40 Yeah, yeah, I played in a funk scob band. Shout out the funk shop luminous. I think everyone's probably dead.
00:25:34.40 --> 00:25:38.48 My band. But uh, and were you guys playing gigs back then?
00:25:38.48 --> 00:25:42.72 Yeah, so we were playing gigs back then. So I ended up, uh, man, I wish I had, uh,
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.48 my wife has a great picture. I of me at the house with my band. I'd plant on blonde hair and like my
00:25:48.48 --> 00:25:54.000 ears pierced, and they're like stretched out and I got the dude. Oh, yeah. So this is like nice.
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.56 So this is 1990. Well, I started playing drums as a kid in church as a, you know, playing that
00:25:58.56 --> 00:26:02.72 gospel music, you know. So when you weren't, cause we got all those like shots. Like it's.
00:26:03.68 --> 00:26:08.96 So it's all those kind of like old gospel chops. And, uh, and so I started playing drums when I was eight.
00:26:09.84 --> 00:26:14.40 And, um, you know, I wasn't like that. We ended up kind of moving out of being, you know,
00:26:14.40 --> 00:26:19.84 really poor and, and, um, you know, kind of got the leg. I guess you could say like, I guess we
00:26:19.84 --> 00:26:23.36 would be the considered middle class or whatever, you know. Yeah, cause you're that had a legit job,
00:26:23.36 --> 00:26:27.84 but then the railroad. Yeah, but he left the railroad. Not what we kind of went down because God was
00:26:27.84 --> 00:26:35.92 gonna pass. Oh, Jack. Yeah. So you guys were ginging, you were in a ginging band. Ginging band. Yeah,
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:39.68 we actually, uh, the band, the funk shop looms opened up from all the beach double all stars.
00:26:39.68 --> 00:26:45.12 Um, do you play? Oh, bro. Yeah, I actually have a demo. We actually have a demo CD. We had a song,
00:26:46.32 --> 00:26:53.68 called single man. And, uh, TV dinners always the same cause I'm a single man.
00:26:54.40 --> 00:27:00.88 One night stands at Colin Mutt name cause I'm a single man. So it was, uh, yeah, we were kind of a
00:27:00.88 --> 00:27:05.92 jam band and funk scob band. And I like that kind of chops. I like gospel music. Like, you know,
00:27:05.92 --> 00:27:11.84 that's kind of what I grew up with and um, guys like Dave Weckle and Ginger Birch and, uh, you know,
00:27:11.84 --> 00:27:16.72 so I was really actually thought I was gonna become a professional drummer. That was like what I was
00:27:16.72 --> 00:27:23.52 really aspiring at the time to be. Um, and I probably would have been how did I stay in the
00:27:23.52 --> 00:27:29.12 trajectory had none 11 not happened. Um, I mean, I was getting, I just got sponsored by Evan's
00:27:29.12 --> 00:27:35.84 drum has JD Adario. Um, so I was, I was getting pretty like serious and I probably wouldn't have
00:27:35.84 --> 00:27:39.36 stayed with that band forever. I would have moved up, you know, and no, it's a very spans and
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:48.80 so not your band before you made it bro. I know, I was looking to you. Yeah. Yeah. I would have moved
00:27:48.80 --> 00:27:57.36 up from Loomis funk. Yeah, my music guy definitely gets people. Well, Scott is like the fact that
00:27:57.36 --> 00:28:04.08 you were playing scommies. Yeah, it's like real pretty. Yeah. It's a well, it's a particular style
00:28:04.08 --> 00:28:09.92 playing to it's a lot of like odd time signatures, you know, like um, and so it's, it's, and it's
00:28:09.92 --> 00:28:13.52 phone can gospel and all that kind of stuff has a similar foundations, you know, it's all based off
00:28:13.52 --> 00:28:18.56 of kind of like jazz, you know. So that's what I did, you know, and I played a lot of like Christian
00:28:18.56 --> 00:28:22.80 music, you know, it was like Jesus rock. Um, and let me tell you something, you get the youth group
00:28:22.80 --> 00:28:28.48 girls when you're like Jesus rock star. You told me to you're playing like at the UG, you can't
00:28:28.48 --> 00:28:32.88 have some stuff, you know, you're like you're like, you're like, you're driving the beat, you know,
00:28:33.44 --> 00:28:38.64 you love a little hard, but you know, Christian youth camp attended, just went down by
00:28:38.64 --> 00:28:43.76 eight percent of for a long girl. By the way, don't go there. I'll never send my kids there. It's
00:28:43.76 --> 00:28:51.20 the worst, you know, back at the van. So so all that's kind of where you're at, your bus and your
00:28:51.20 --> 00:28:57.84 ass work and your playing music and making money enough money to buy an outie that you really can't
00:28:57.84 --> 00:29:03.28 afford to fix, but still you got the outie and then September 11th comes. Yeah, September 11th came
00:29:03.28 --> 00:29:06.80 and I had never like, you know, thought about joining the military and then like, where were you
00:29:06.80 --> 00:29:11.20 on September 11th? Cause you're in the city. So I was in Queens, New York. Yeah, I was on a telephone
00:29:11.20 --> 00:29:17.12 bowl when it happened. So I was on a railroad pole at the time. My job was to send a, so time
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:23.36 Warner was being stood up high speed internet road runner and we had to isolate those systems
00:29:23.36 --> 00:29:27.44 what they called power supplies. And so power supplies had to be isolated. So if there's a
00:29:27.44 --> 00:29:32.000 lightning strike, it would only go like 300 feet before the next pole and not blow the whole system.
00:29:32.72 --> 00:29:37.44 So I had a job putting in these power supplies and then grounding everything to power,
00:29:37.44 --> 00:29:41.76 bell, cable, and all the way down to the ground and then I would stall these big supplies and then
00:29:41.76 --> 00:29:46.08 wire everything up. And I got paid for everything. I mean, if I put like a screw on, I could
00:29:46.08 --> 00:29:52.08 bill for it. Whatever it was. So it was, it was a good gig. I mean, make it 7800 bucks a day. After I paid
00:29:52.08 --> 00:29:57.52 my guys on all my expenses. So it was like, it was good money and I was a hustler. And so,
00:29:57.52 --> 00:30:03.36 I mean, I could just, I would work when the sun was up, like, you know, I was on my second
00:30:03.36 --> 00:30:09.44 cup of coffee and making money. So, um, yeah, the, the first plane hits the world trades
00:30:09.44 --> 00:30:14.80 center. I'm on telephone pole. I have no idea what's going on. And I get a call in the next
00:30:14.80 --> 00:30:19.20 tell from a friend of mine that tells me that I'll play and just hit the World Trade Center.
00:30:19.20 --> 00:30:26.000 And at first I really didn't believe him. And I come down off the pole and end up like meeting a lady
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.68 who's had her door open, like right next to where the pole was basically. She lived right by the
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:35.92 railroad tracks. And what a terrible place to live. Oh my god, when people live by the railroad tracks,
00:30:35.92 --> 00:30:41.68 it's like, especially on the East Coast, like when you take the train, they'll, they'll
00:30:41.68 --> 00:30:46.56 contract. Yeah, if you live by the railroad tracks, it's a bummer. That's, that's right. Let's face it
00:30:46.56 --> 00:30:51.52 out here in California. You can live by railroad tracks in Ensenitis and have an ocean view that
00:30:51.52 --> 00:30:56.08 right in the house that you paid $4.8 million for. It's not that way on the East Coast. No,
00:30:56.08 --> 00:30:59.52 it has made it. It has made it. Shingles. Yeah. They're like, the, how, you know how this house is
00:30:59.52 --> 00:31:04.40 our shingles? Yeah. It's like, yeah, these are working on the roof. Let's just keep going. And,
00:31:05.28 --> 00:31:08.96 yeah, so I was like, so I come down. I see this lady. She's in there. She's watching the news.
00:31:08.96 --> 00:31:13.44 Has been was a port authority police officer and she was kind of crying and emotional. You know,
00:31:13.44 --> 00:31:19.52 then, obviously, the other plane hits. And like, at the time, I thought like America was like under
00:31:19.52 --> 00:31:23.28 attack or we're being invaded. I don't know. I had all these like weird thoughts probably from
00:31:23.28 --> 00:31:31.04 watching like movies and red don't. Red don't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, I, I go back to the
00:31:31.04 --> 00:31:36.16 yards. And I got my buddy with me. We got rid of the other dude. We gave him his hundred bucks. And
00:31:36.16 --> 00:31:41.36 and I was like, I'm going into the city and my buddy's like, to do what? I don't like it. I don't
00:31:41.36 --> 00:31:45.92 know how to like help out. And he's like, you don't know anything. I remember this conversation
00:31:45.92 --> 00:31:49.84 we were at because I did. I don't know. I was going to do a victim or something. How old are you?
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:57.44 I was 21. Okay. Yeah. So, I'm 42 now. And so I was like, so I go in an air drop everything
00:31:57.44 --> 00:32:02.72 off take the outie. Get on the LIE 495 and I'm like hauling an ass down there. There was no traffic.
00:32:02.72 --> 00:32:10.48 It was crazy. And I'm like, Max and this car out. It's probably why I broke down. And I get to the,
00:32:10.88 --> 00:32:15.84 I think it's the Lincoln tunnel and there's like already tactical teams and guys all standing there
00:32:16.80 --> 00:32:21.84 tell you how tight security was. Like, I had like a bunch of like cable TV and electrical IDs.
00:32:21.84 --> 00:32:26.40 And like just, you know, I look like a state department guy and I rack, you know, I have like
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:33.20 a million badges or whatever. And I tell him I'm like a demolition crew and can you, can you let
00:32:33.20 --> 00:32:37.44 me through and they're like, yeah, bring it in. And so I just drove right on through and we went
00:32:37.44 --> 00:32:42.88 down there and parked. And that's when I, you know, towers had fallen into the radio. And that's when
00:32:43.92 --> 00:32:48.000 I realized like the severity of everything that was happened. And like I could see the smoke and people
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.88 were screaming and running everywhere. And I'd never seen anything like that in my life. And so
00:32:54.88 --> 00:32:59.92 I ripped the sleeve off my shirt, put it on my face and my buddy and just walked into the smoke.
00:33:00.48 --> 00:33:06.80 Basically at this point, no idea where I was going. So I would stay there for 24 hours till September
00:33:06.80 --> 00:33:16.16 12th. And that was, uh, what are you doing? At first, like nothing. I was just like trying to like
00:33:16.16 --> 00:33:20.32 see if anybody needed help. But like I needed help myself because I was covered in a smoke and
00:33:20.32 --> 00:33:24.48 everybody was running the opposite way. So I ended up getting in there and then they were putting
00:33:24.48 --> 00:33:28.56 together these like makeshift shirt. It was total chaos. Like I don't think that people,
00:33:28.56 --> 00:33:32.48 unless you were there, like realize like there was really no organization. It wasn't like,
00:33:33.52 --> 00:33:38.48 there was half, you know, the fire department was dead. There smashed vehicles, cop cars everywhere. So
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:41.92 we kind of started like getting together with groups to like look for people.
00:33:42.88 --> 00:33:48.16 Layed in the afternoon, I ended up seeing like a guy's leg sticking out from underneath the police car.
00:33:48.16 --> 00:33:54.48 And a bunch of us got over there and lifted it up and he was dead. And I remember like all
00:33:54.48 --> 00:33:58.08 their gravel and everything was like shoved into his face. He must have hit underneath the car.
00:33:58.72 --> 00:34:05.60 I don't know the speculate, but whatever happened, the car lifted up and smooshed him. And so
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:10.80 people like pulled him out and they pulled like some blankets over him and fire department came in.
00:34:11.52 --> 00:34:15.68 City bank tower fell. That tower, you know, mystical tower seven. I was like right there.
00:34:15.68 --> 00:34:20.56 And, you know, for a couple of hours, I couldn't see my hand around my face. It was one of the
00:34:20.56 --> 00:34:25.68 most terrifying experiences in my life until I became an SDV guy. Did you stay put? Did you just stay there?
00:34:25.68 --> 00:34:29.68 I just stayed there with my shirt over my head, but I couldn't breathe. And then I go to the fire department,
00:34:29.68 --> 00:34:35.60 they watched my eyes out and I stayed there all night. I found like an arm and like testins,
00:34:35.60 --> 00:34:40.72 like I had I crawled inside the World Trade Center. Like I was sliding down the metal beams
00:34:40.72 --> 00:34:46.24 into the belly of the World Trade Center. And it was like the most insane noises I ever heard of my
00:34:46.24 --> 00:34:52.96 life like creaking and you know, just like smoke and steam. And it was just it was so chaotic. I had no
00:34:52.96 --> 00:34:59.84 idea what I was doing, but I wanted to help. I had this memory of like on a bicycle to tire on my
00:34:59.84 --> 00:35:05.36 heart hat with those little like disposable ever ready like red and green like with the white switch
00:35:05.36 --> 00:35:10.56 lights. That was my headland. I had them like tied on there to the rescue. And
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:14.88 even if I found somebody, I don't really know what I would have done because I had zero skills really.
00:35:14.88 --> 00:35:22.40 And so I'm right by that iconic picture of where the exoskeleton of the World Trade Center is,
00:35:22.40 --> 00:35:26.32 where the guys are raising the flag and it's all over the posters and stuff. I'm like sitting
00:35:26.32 --> 00:35:33.28 off to the right. And so the next morning, I was there, got some food to have like a smashed up
00:35:33.28 --> 00:35:38.08 like little bagel cart that was there with my buddy. And I remember for the first time since
00:35:38.08 --> 00:35:44.40 like that dude hit me and I had that bug nut. I uh, I was like crying really hard.
00:35:44.96 --> 00:35:51.68 Like I could feel the death. I could feel the departure of life in that area. Like you could
00:35:51.68 --> 00:35:58.80 feel the immense loss. And I was in there with my buddy. I'm like we're just crying. And he's just
00:35:58.80 --> 00:36:02.48 looks at me. He's like, man, like, what are we going to do? The sun's coming up. It's the next morning.
00:36:02.48 --> 00:36:09.92 And I just like, time was like, I'm not fucking killer. I did this. And he was like, okay, like,
00:36:10.88 --> 00:36:16.40 you know, maybe you kind of patting me on the back like, yeah, okay. And so I ended up
00:36:17.36 --> 00:36:21.76 deciding 2003 that I joined the military because what happened was I lost my contract. Like six,
00:36:21.76 --> 00:36:25.84 and maybe it wasn't six months, maybe three months later. I lost my contract.
00:36:25.84 --> 00:36:32.000 So through the end of 2001, you go back to work. Go back to work.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.32 But then they're like, you know, all this economic ambiguity, all the new build, all this stuff
00:36:36.32 --> 00:36:41.76 they start cutting, I'm like, low guy in the total, you know, subcontractor. So I own like all these,
00:36:44.32 --> 00:36:49.68 like all this line equipment that I bought and you know how to truck that was, I bought that payment
00:36:49.68 --> 00:36:55.20 on at my Audi, like I had all this shit. And now I'm like, you know, basically I'm just trying
00:36:55.20 --> 00:36:58.40 to keep everything afloat. I couldn't find any work. Everyone's freaking out. I'm watching it.
00:36:58.40 --> 00:37:04.16 It includes the TV, you know, 24 hour new cycle. And so I ended up selling everything off.
00:37:05.28 --> 00:37:12.56 picked up some like side work. And then moved out to big sky Montana. And I got a job as a ski
00:37:12.56 --> 00:37:18.40 tech out there because I was just like, I was was watching this warren Miller movie. And he said,
00:37:18.40 --> 00:37:22.56 if you don't pack up everything that you have, I moved it big sky Montana. You only be one year old
00:37:22.56 --> 00:37:31.92 year when you do. And I was like, so I got a job out there in a ski shop, fix and skis. And so I worked out
00:37:31.92 --> 00:37:37.92 there, came back. Did you know anything about skiing? Yeah, I had, I mean, my idea of skiing, like,
00:37:37.92 --> 00:37:42.48 I hate them. Like, I basically just like stole the skis. Like, and I would, I had a pair of
00:37:42.48 --> 00:37:47.84 wires and they first. And that's how I learned about ski. My parents did take me on like a youth group
00:37:47.84 --> 00:37:54.000 thing one, but I spent most of the time trying to like make out with a crow. And then get saved on the
00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:01.52 next Sunday. Get forgiveness. But I know I would go up with a pair of like wires and numbers.
00:38:01.52 --> 00:38:05.36 And you know, you just have the old things. And I would like snip them off and put them on my jacket.
00:38:05.36 --> 00:38:10.32 And that's how it would ski. And that's what's ski all the time like that. I know it sounds terrible.
00:38:10.32 --> 00:38:16.32 And I'm sorry if you're listening. And I did that too. It's free forgiveness. But I mean, that's
00:38:16.32 --> 00:38:21.60 how I was. You know, I mean, I didn't really, I didn't have, you know, a lot of things. And so
00:38:22.72 --> 00:38:26.40 so anyway, I went out there and I worked in the skate shop. And I was just basically with a ski bump.
00:38:26.40 --> 00:38:35.44 And it was awesome. And I met my, um, my first and only ex-wife. So, uh, she was like a work exchange
00:38:35.44 --> 00:38:42.88 program for Brazil. Little spotty of the English show, weren't well. And, um, yeah, so, so I ended up,
00:38:42.88 --> 00:38:47.12 you know, working out there for basically about a year coming back and then getting on a line crew.
00:38:47.12 --> 00:38:51.20 And that's when I decided I was going to join the military. And then how do you figure out the
00:38:51.20 --> 00:38:59.20 maybe? Well, um, I tried to join the army because I had seen like everything Roberts ridge and all that kind of stuff.
00:38:59.20 --> 00:39:04.08 And, uh, I didn't know like a ton about the military. And I, you know, of course, the army's
00:39:04.08 --> 00:39:07.52 turning to give me to go on the infantry and you work your way up. And this is where it starts.
00:39:07.52 --> 00:39:14.72 I'm like, hmm, I didn't. So, a navy guy actually came out and like saw me and I kept going to the mall
00:39:14.72 --> 00:39:19.84 because the recruiting station was in the mall, um, which meant, you know, go try to get a military.
00:39:19.84 --> 00:39:27.20 I didn't work out. Get orange, Julia. So, that's kind of, it's orange, Julia still around.
00:39:27.20 --> 00:39:32.16 Do you best still look there? I think all the customers died. One like at a time.
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:36.40 Yeah, pretty good. I didn't even do that all the time. Yeah, exactly.
00:39:36.40 --> 00:39:40.88 So, obviously a navy recruiter sees you. He sees, well, he's like, he starts chatting up with me.
00:39:40.88 --> 00:39:45.44 He's like coming back for lunch on one day. And he's like, oh, I have like, seeing you coming here
00:39:45.44 --> 00:39:49.04 at a bunch. Like, what are you doing? You're always like, you're like, oh, they're like, I'm trying to get a
00:39:49.04 --> 00:39:53.84 rate going the Rangers. And he's like, oh, why do you want to do that? And I was like, oh, because, you know,
00:39:53.84 --> 00:39:59.84 they're the best in the world. Like, it was none or not. He's like, let me show you a video.
00:39:59.84 --> 00:40:05.44 He brings me in there and shows me like the CJ crock is kind of video. Like, it's like the
00:40:05.44 --> 00:40:11.20 dudes doing flutter kicks in the shorts and they're like in the desert. Like, I mean, it was at the time,
00:40:11.20 --> 00:40:16.64 the coolest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life. And I was just like in Thrall. And these dudes are like,
00:40:16.64 --> 00:40:22.16 doing the triangle defense and like they're so, I was like, man, he's like, yeah, the navy seal is like,
00:40:22.72 --> 00:40:25.92 they're the best. And I was like, oh, man, what do I got to do? He's like, you got to just sign up,
00:40:25.92 --> 00:40:31.36 take a little PT test. I was like, great. Like, so I go through all this stuff. And it took me a
00:40:31.36 --> 00:40:35.12 little while to get longer to get in. Then I had wanted because I had a couple of like,
00:40:35.12 --> 00:40:41.84 little altercations in my life. I had to get cleared up. And yeah, so I ended up started doing
00:40:41.84 --> 00:40:46.000 like a bunch of research. And I was like, I could barely swim. I could swim. But I wasn't like,
00:40:47.12 --> 00:40:53.84 that kind of swimmer. So I started, I started training. I bought the, like a
00:40:54.56 --> 00:41:02.24 navy seal workout book. And I started boxing again. Because you grew up boxing? I grew up boxing.
00:41:02.24 --> 00:41:07.28 Yeah. How much did you boxing your or a kit? On and off pretty much since I was like about 10.
00:41:08.32 --> 00:41:12.08 I started in Catskown, New York. Same place, Mike Tyson learned in Catskown village boxing.
00:41:12.08 --> 00:41:19.36 There you go. Yeah. And I actually continued. I understood working out. Because if you never did that,
00:41:19.36 --> 00:41:23.92 you were working. But working in the back of the day was kind of like the toe touchers, you know,
00:41:23.92 --> 00:41:28.000 you're doing the side. It was not as like, you know, side-dificors. It is, did I?
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.08 I remember getting ready to come in the navy and thinking like, dude, you know, I did whatever.
00:41:34.08 --> 00:41:38.72 Five sets of eight pull-ups like on. What a good workout. Because you just had no idea. I mean,
00:41:38.72 --> 00:41:43.92 this is like 89. So there's no, well, at least there was no information available that I had.
00:41:43.92 --> 00:41:48.96 I mean, it wasn't going to go to a library. Library, Lee couldn't get Google shit and figured out.
00:41:49.68 --> 00:41:54.72 So, and at least if you box like you knew, even if you just knew like, you got to pressure
00:41:54.72 --> 00:41:59.52 yourself. Like you obviously did you compete boxing? Yeah, I bought something. Then you knew. Like you,
00:41:59.52 --> 00:42:04.56 you knew how to push yourself hard in a workout. Absolutely. But that was like a different kind of like
00:42:05.60 --> 00:42:10.32 in the sense, basically, the workouts I was doing was running push us. So like, I was, I would get
00:42:10.32 --> 00:42:14.72 up in the morning. I would get up before work. So I had a job. I started working for a roofing
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:20.72 contractor. Once I was working for a line guy, that job kind of foiled out and thank God.
00:42:20.72 --> 00:42:25.76 These guys were crazy. I was working on Glenn's falls. Anyway, Lauren Cruz got some crazy
00:42:25.76 --> 00:42:30.64 feefall in it. They got a lot of problems. I found myself living in a trail and Glenn's falls
00:42:30.64 --> 00:42:34.64 with this dude, Johnny's even to pay my hotel or whatever. But anyway, so I'm like, doing that.
00:42:34.64 --> 00:42:38.96 I ended up getting job for this roofing company. So I'm roofing all day. I'm working at a
00:42:38.96 --> 00:42:43.04 pizza re-at night. And on the weekends, I worked for this guy, Sange, as you gone in guy,
00:42:43.44 --> 00:42:48.24 who had a bunch of slums. And I was going there and basically patch everything up temporarily.
00:42:48.24 --> 00:42:54.64 You know, I wish FlexTate was around because I was basically flex-taving everything.
00:42:54.64 --> 00:42:59.36 Just to make it like, you know, pass the sniff test for the runners. And so I was working three
00:42:59.36 --> 00:43:05.28 jobs. And you know, Boston might ask making pizzas. And matter of fact, this is so when I went to
00:43:05.28 --> 00:43:13.52 buds, I had a bicycle that I bought from a guy that came in the pizza rea. It was a really cool
00:43:13.52 --> 00:43:20.000 specialized stump jumper. Like for the day, it was like, yeah, like the shocks. I mean, it was like
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.72 they was sick. And I took that the buds with me. I bought it for 60 bucks. And at the pizza rea. And I
00:43:26.72 --> 00:43:36.40 sold that bike to Mike Everett, who was my neighbor. Yeah. Anyway, just a little factoid. But
00:43:36.40 --> 00:43:41.44 um, so if he still has that, you know, I don't know if he's been in the car. Oh, he's been my key ever.
00:43:41.44 --> 00:43:45.84 Mike Everett. The team guy. Yeah. Oh, wait. He was your neighbor. Yeah, there's my neighbor when I
00:43:45.84 --> 00:43:49.92 lived in buds. I lived in a period of beach. Okay. And I lived like two blocks over him. And how I
00:43:49.92 --> 00:43:54.96 met him was I was going through buds. Of course, I showed him, you know, I got the toe head. And
00:43:54.96 --> 00:44:00.48 I he was selling a Jeep. And I had seen the movie. I wanted a Jeep as Navy SEALs. And I didn't
00:44:00.48 --> 00:44:05.92 end of getting one. I mean, I had I wanted to say when I like bought into it like big time. He
00:44:05.92 --> 00:44:09.52 became like a Navy SEALS story. And I bought every single, I've read everything. You know,
00:44:10.56 --> 00:44:14.32 hunters and shooters, you know, men of devil's with cream. I read everything. The stories that
00:44:14.32 --> 00:44:22.24 I mean, I was like obsessed. And that's how I am on like a total immersion guy. But Mikey was
00:44:22.24 --> 00:44:25.84 I when I lived in Coronada, we was a team one. Yeah. Mike used the team one. Mike was my
00:44:25.84 --> 00:44:30.72 opportunity. One. We lived in the upstairs apartment. And he lived in the downstairs apartment. So I have
00:44:31.76 --> 00:44:37.28 many, many, many, many Mikey's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good all. I would go over it. Like,
00:44:37.28 --> 00:44:41.92 so I met him. He's like, I went over there and I was like, Oh, how much for your Jeep is like,
00:44:41.92 --> 00:44:47.68 are you in buds? I was like, yeah, he's like, the fuck out of here. He says something like that to me or
00:44:47.68 --> 00:44:52.24 something. I was like, if we come back when you get a brown T shirt, he said to me, I ended up like,
00:44:52.24 --> 00:44:57.28 getting him known through buds. I like he's like the nicest guy ever. He's the nicest guy. And his wife,
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:02.80 you know, his little girl, just great people for sure. It was like a hells angel and he was like on
00:45:02.80 --> 00:45:11.04 easy riders and stuff. Like, I mean, super cool people. The best. The best. But I get used to get crazy
00:45:11.04 --> 00:45:17.76 with stuff. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I was like, so I went over. I remember I sold my bike to him. I needed
00:45:17.76 --> 00:45:24.16 like the money. I forgot. I forgot. I was, why? I was, I wish I never sold it. My sold in that bike
00:45:24.16 --> 00:45:30.56 that I bought the pizza ria and for 60 bucks. I think it sold to him for 150. So I'm ripping off
00:45:30.56 --> 00:45:38.88 it out to the business. I got you Mike. So I'm like, so I'm training for buds. I'm like, basically
00:45:38.88 --> 00:45:45.60 order the baits like 626 or whatever they were and the pants and and I just start working out
00:45:45.60 --> 00:45:51.92 and and training my ass off and I'm meeting a guy named through my recruiter. I got him
00:45:51.92 --> 00:45:57.92 drew a bit of it. You know he is? I don't know. And old team guy. He was a commander. I don't know.
00:45:57.92 --> 00:46:01.76 Yeah. And he started off in UDTs and went on and they ran this like seal,
00:46:04.40 --> 00:46:09.04 training course and Greenwich Connecticut. So you would go down there and you're supposed to get
00:46:09.04 --> 00:46:14.56 this like letter of approval or like recommendation. I never got shit from it. But it was a great
00:46:14.56 --> 00:46:21.36 experience because I met a bunch of guys that later on I would go on and serve with. And we would
00:46:21.36 --> 00:46:26.64 train like on the once a month together for like a whole weekend and I'd never done anything like that.
00:46:26.64 --> 00:46:31.44 And so it was a really good experience. I you know worked out tons and you know I'd work out
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:36.96 the morning. We're out in the evening. I showed up the buds. You know go through boot camp.
00:46:37.44 --> 00:46:42.96 Which was like I'll never forget it because I remember the boot camp guy was like I got busted
00:46:42.96 --> 00:46:48.64 taken them lunches for the sick people and eating them tonight. And I was so hungry because I
00:46:48.64 --> 00:46:54.88 would like go work out in the bathroom. And I was so nervous about failing. And I got busted.
00:46:55.60 --> 00:46:58.88 And so they another you had all these restrictions going on. Then they had that dive.
00:46:58.88 --> 00:47:05.60 My voter rating program going on run by Jody McIntyre was right at the time. And so I would
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:10.16 like go over there and I'd get these little passes. And then I started knowing all the scruffs
00:47:10.16 --> 00:47:13.68 waiting to go to buds. And so they would give me these passes. And then eventually I was just kind of
00:47:13.68 --> 00:47:21.68 feeling about leaving like and wandering around boot camp, right? So I started calling my my my now
00:47:21.68 --> 00:47:27.76 X-wife. Um and I'd go in the phone booth and I got busted by the chief like right before graduation.
00:47:27.76 --> 00:47:31.84 So I never really got to see my family. They restricted me before I left to go to buds or whatever.
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:37.04 I was eating Eminem and I was like in the booth and I was like I saw my chief and I was like
00:47:37.04 --> 00:47:42.32 I just time it wrong. Literally I was walking on with like chips on my chin. I like walked out.
00:47:42.32 --> 00:47:47.04 He's like looks at me and I was like I have a pass and he's giving your pass.
00:47:47.04 --> 00:47:53.44 Okay. He's like who signed this? I was like a petty loser Johnson.
00:47:53.44 --> 00:47:58.80 Like I got it. That was my first taste of like the military has you by the balls.
00:47:59.60 --> 00:48:04.16 And yeah, so I show up a class up with class 2, 5, 4.
00:48:04.16 --> 00:48:09.76 Matter of fact, I graduated Brian Booshwa. Oh right. Yeah. Right. It was my mind.
00:48:10.40 --> 00:48:18.000 And yeah, so I classed up with them and yeah, I grew through. I think we graduated 13 original guys
00:48:18.40 --> 00:48:25.28 that class graduate was like guys like Ryan Bates and uh yeah, I remember I didn't shout through
00:48:25.28 --> 00:48:30.56 I'm making that first because I'm like hey Ryan's like he does like rassals like that.
00:48:30.56 --> 00:48:36.08 Lions then like what the fuck is the lions then you know that one's like he's like in the
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:42.56 best shape ever like everyone's there. I was like forget be his ass like I just was like not having it.
00:48:42.56 --> 00:48:50.000 We ended up becoming super good vibes you know, but yeah, I tell a story a lot, but I don't say his name
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.36 Brian, but uh it's like one of those moments where I was they were going through training and
00:48:55.36 --> 00:49:01.28 through work up training and I was running the training and there's like total chaos going on in the
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:06.88 mountain town and there's just like everyone's getting shot up with paintball or whatever and no
00:49:06.88 --> 00:49:13.20 once making any decisions and I could already I a guy like him he stood out because he's just like
00:49:13.20 --> 00:49:18.24 we're stuck freaking stud and we're square it away and I don't think I had trained because eventually
00:49:18.24 --> 00:49:22.16 you know we trained together in GJT and whatnot so I think I kind of knew that or whatever but that
00:49:22.16 --> 00:49:28.48 wasn't he was good as an operator you know beyond GJT through he was good as an operator and I knew it and
00:49:28.48 --> 00:49:32.56 you could all you could tell like in a platoon there'd be like two guys that were good or three guys
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:36.24 that were good or whatever and it might be the OIC it might be the platoon chief it might be the LPL
00:49:36.24 --> 00:49:41.52 or it might be some for freaking random E5 so I've been watching him and there's some total
00:49:41.52 --> 00:49:46.80 mayhem and chaos going on and he's like crouch down behind a wall and I walk over to like hey bro
00:49:46.80 --> 00:49:51.84 what's going on he's like just crazy and I said what do you think you do right now and he's like
00:49:51.84 --> 00:49:56.000 we should we should pretty strong point that building and I go why don't you make it happen he and he
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:04.88 it was beautiful the look on his face was like oh I can't do that and he just is like hey
00:50:05.12 --> 00:50:08.48 we're strong point in that building over there and here's like you know I don't even know he's a new guy
00:50:08.48 --> 00:50:12.64 maybe he's a one cruise wonder whatever he started making calls and people just listened and they did
00:50:12.64 --> 00:50:19.84 with their supposed to do and yeah I love that guy yeah I know yeah you know I have so van Wilson
00:50:19.84 --> 00:50:26.56 he was a team guy that got killed in car crash day after we graduated but academy grad officer
00:50:27.20 --> 00:50:32.32 he was an NCAA wrestling champ monster I know we're all heartbroken we all got like tattoos
00:50:32.32 --> 00:50:39.20 the night before whatever together and you know we're all all super tight and yeah that was uh that
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:46.40 being in buzz and that like that changed my life you know that whole that whole experience you know
00:50:46.40 --> 00:50:50.48 I was like finally like a part of something you know did you have trouble with anything you said
00:50:50.48 --> 00:50:54.32 you weren't that great of a swim or did you figure it out no I used everything except for the last one
00:50:54.32 --> 00:51:01.28 but uh my heart got been in first time every time had I not dragged another friend of mine
00:51:01.28 --> 00:51:06.40 he's getting ready to get out uh because he was he was done after that if he didn't pass that it was over
00:51:06.40 --> 00:51:13.28 for him and he was like sandbag and like crazy drag on but you that's pretty good that you were
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:18.56 able to not really be like a water guy and pass everything yeah I mean later on I would become you
00:51:18.56 --> 00:51:23.20 know I started competing you know you know a free dive spear fishing I know around the world
00:51:23.92 --> 00:51:30.56 so I mean I that water experience and then being an STV guy which was like if they they should
00:51:30.56 --> 00:51:34.96 just have the STV at Buds like day one everyone get into this we're gonna sink in under the water
00:51:34.96 --> 00:51:41.68 into the dark you would you would you would weed out like 75% of the people a lot of people it's terrifying
00:51:41.68 --> 00:51:46.88 and so I got out went you know went to eating Delta went to the soccer medicores and then
00:51:48.32 --> 00:51:55.20 got sent to STV D1 how tall are you six four do they think about that at all I mean that
00:51:55.20 --> 00:52:02.56 this is a make sense bro no so if you don't STV is like a mini sub and it's it's a it's what's
00:52:02.56 --> 00:52:07.52 called a wet submersible which means when you're in it it's filled with water so it's not like
00:52:07.52 --> 00:52:12.88 you're in a little submarine like James Bond all listening to iTunes with with the freaking
00:52:12.88 --> 00:52:20.32 eater on it's it's like this tight they're not big they're small and they fill up with water
00:52:21.52 --> 00:52:27.84 ocean water not like one water ocean water is around you and can't move in it there's a guy in
00:52:27.84 --> 00:52:34.000 front of you and so like the dive profiles get so you know I went to STV school I crashed the STV
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.76 like before I graduated which was great because I ended up becoming a backseat guy and I got to do
00:52:37.76 --> 00:52:44.08 the real world mission but I was like I'll never forget I had to officer next to me I can't remember
00:52:44.08 --> 00:52:49.44 his name he was a told dick and and he was like so bossy he's a new officer he knows he wants to
00:52:49.44 --> 00:52:56.32 believe me yeah and I'm but we drive they nap so I got the stick I'm like you know control in the
00:52:56.32 --> 00:53:00.56 ballast I'm like you know and I was like hey sir I think there's like there's something in front
00:53:00.56 --> 00:53:04.72 of us I think it was like just stay on this course and I'm like I don't know he's like it's just
00:53:04.72 --> 00:53:10.64 artifact I'm like I think that's a thing like and I was like so I was like okay fine so I
00:53:10.64 --> 00:53:15.36 like cranked celery and it like he fell right in I hit it and it was like how the middle of
00:53:15.36 --> 00:53:20.56 ocean was like one of those like rock little jetties with the with the little lighthouse on it
00:53:21.20 --> 00:53:25.20 and also it was like you know we come rocketing out and all of the water trades out like
00:53:25.20 --> 00:53:31.60 shhh I'm like hmm so I like open up the door and I like looked down there's like land
00:53:31.60 --> 00:53:36.80 I look at him he's like oh shit like we're there and so that was the end of my driving career
00:53:38.24 --> 00:53:42.64 and he was he was pissed because I did I said okay fine and I just accelerated right in
00:53:42.64 --> 00:53:49.20 it so um graduate as to be school go out to the team and you know that's when I started learning
00:53:49.20 --> 00:53:57.20 like how sophisticated that really is and how you know it's super complicated you're diving mixed gas
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.24 rebriebers and open circuit all in these various profiles throughout a very long dives under
00:54:04.24 --> 00:54:10.80 under pressure and like 12 hours eight hours like yeah and you you'll switch on and off so you'll
00:54:10.80 --> 00:54:15.76 be like you know you can't be on rebrie either you know because you get oxygen tosses it
00:54:15.76 --> 00:54:20.48 it's a area you can't be on all heli-ox or nitrox or you can't be on all open circuit because
00:54:20.48 --> 00:54:23.84 I'm nitrigen our coasts so you're like in the new have these like computers with all these
00:54:23.84 --> 00:54:28.24 like lights that blink and like these huge like screens and I could never remember like
00:54:28.24 --> 00:54:34.24 I knew that double red was not good you might know that there's like double red not be like
00:54:34.24 --> 00:54:41.84 uh manually enter the air like and I'm like oh double green I think it's okay solid I'm good
00:54:41.84 --> 00:54:48.000 and so there's a guy right in front of you and you can't move so he sits in between your legs
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.64 all your gear and all your equipment gets shoved in the back and then everything's pitch black so
00:54:52.64 --> 00:54:58.72 when we're training for the national tasking like everything's by memory every single thing
00:54:58.72 --> 00:55:04.64 has a not every single light has a signal you know because you're not using the under the OTS system
00:55:04.64 --> 00:55:09.52 you know because it could be heard so everything is by feel so everything begins like you know
00:55:09.52 --> 00:55:13.44 first you're in these huge tanks and then you're graduating up until you're in the ocean so
00:55:13.44 --> 00:55:20.40 everything in the pitch black so like when things get out of sync it gets very confusing and then
00:55:20.96 --> 00:55:25.36 you have to FSA at the end you have to take your rigs click it to the outside and then the sub will
00:55:25.36 --> 00:55:30.64 surface and then you like blow out closer rebrie either and kick away and then the sub leaves
00:55:30.64 --> 00:55:34.72 and then you're on the surface and then you swim ashore you know and then you have underwater
00:55:34.72 --> 00:55:40.64 painters that find you like all that kind of stuff so it was like at first like not what I had
00:55:40.64 --> 00:55:46.72 like signed up to do like meanwhile I'm like watching the news you know it's like like let's go like
00:55:46.72 --> 00:55:54.24 break and I'm like underwater like like hand signal so I wouldn't change it for anything in the
00:55:54.24 --> 00:56:01.20 world because of the team I got to be a part of what we got to do and the knowledge that I gained
00:56:01.20 --> 00:56:08.16 of that mobility platform it was something that I think like within the teams is so like niche
00:56:08.56 --> 00:56:12.48 and most people think you know because the STV guys always get like bad rap you know like
00:56:12.48 --> 00:56:18.88 golf freaking like a STV guys like but I got out of that and then I got to augment damn neck
00:56:18.88 --> 00:56:27.92 so seven days later after that deployment so yeah that it's at the the attitude of like oh
00:56:27.92 --> 00:56:34.32 STV guys like I I don't know at some point and I was pretty young when I was like yeah you know
00:56:34.32 --> 00:56:40.56 what that those guys freaking get my respect and because it's it I don't know I I mean I
00:56:40.56 --> 00:56:45.84 talked to some on my friend one of my friends particular was like who came from STV and was that
00:56:45.84 --> 00:56:53.68 whatever team we were at and I remember he's a good dude all solid dude and a like team a reliable
00:56:53.68 --> 00:56:58.08 team guy that you would want to go with you on top and one time when you're talking he was like
00:56:58.08 --> 00:57:05.60 hey man we were doing like some exercise off of Korea and you know it's winter time and he was like
00:57:06.80 --> 00:57:11.92 he's telling me he's all like he's all like in the like he starts filling up with water he's like
00:57:11.92 --> 00:57:16.16 I don't want to do the city board yeah but he's like I don't want to do this I don't want to
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:19.12 this about whatever this is not what I don't do I don't do this anymore like literally
00:57:19.12 --> 00:57:24.08 having deal our thoughts like you wanted to quit after he's been in team for 10 years bro people
00:57:24.08 --> 00:57:27.36 bolt we've had team guys I'm gonna call him out but like there was team guys that would
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:35.36 freak panic I mean you can get we had a we had a chief uh in my second putin who drowned and died
00:57:36.56 --> 00:57:40.000 I mean got tangled up in the lines and I bought him up you know because they would bought him
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.48 up underneath stuff and it was uh it's sketchy there's lines everywhere there's stuff going
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:50.56 everything's by merit you have all this gear all this equipment all this stuff like it is you
00:57:50.56 --> 00:57:57.36 have to maintain like a totally cool mind and then when you get into like dried out sheltering
00:57:58.16 --> 00:58:02.000 in the real world and all those kind of things like things can go sideways quick
00:58:02.80 --> 00:58:07.20 so there's no mistakes matter fact I remember we were training for that for that mission how
00:58:07.20 --> 00:58:13.68 was that 80 feet on a river my buddy my my best friend actually like we're down in the bottom
00:58:13.68 --> 00:58:17.28 I remember I had like a leak in my mask and I was like looking at I was like pointing you know
00:58:17.28 --> 00:58:22.48 doing the same like there's a problem he's like typically like you're good and I remember I was like
00:58:23.28 --> 00:58:29.44 and the whole piece goes like and I was like and he looked at me he's like there is no
00:58:29.44 --> 00:58:33.36 buddy breathing you're in like a full face mask he's like you know just remember he was like
00:58:33.36 --> 00:58:37.52 a watch you don't he just he just looks at me like you're dead like and I remember I just was like
00:58:37.52 --> 00:58:46.48 it's just blown go hey blown go from me to feet yeah it was wild these like I'll never forget
00:58:46.48 --> 00:58:50.88 your face it was hilarious that was like it was all areas you could like it never make that he's
00:58:50.88 --> 00:58:58.48 again and listen about to die we did we used to do more solops in the regular teams yeah and so
00:58:59.04 --> 00:59:03.60 you know like I did a few trips of doing lockouts and stuff and even that you know you're in this
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:08.000 little freaking chamber and it's filling up with water and it's freezing cold and you got it
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.68 you would we have we'd have like weapons bags and engine bags and all this stuff in there
00:59:12.24 --> 00:59:18.48 and it's all claustrophobic and I'm I'm I'm very comfortable in the water but like guys did not like
00:59:18.48 --> 00:59:24.96 even that and that's one you know 100th of what it's actually like because when we do that we be like
00:59:24.96 --> 00:59:31.12 cool hey we're gonna do we're gonna use sawbops for a week or whatever two weeks you guys is just like
00:59:31.12 --> 00:59:39.28 oh what are we doing for the rest of our lives sub-ops it's like you got to go through something right
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:42.88 you know you're learning and it's got through something that's just your life and you know
00:59:42.88 --> 00:59:47.12 we we just did a 12 hour dive today cool what are we doing tomorrow that's 12 hour dive
00:59:47.12 --> 00:59:55.52 no man it never it's like you you had to I mean you you got to learn to relax like you can't
00:59:55.52 --> 01:00:02.48 freak out in those situations at all no no like you know we used to always say like those who
01:00:02.48 --> 01:00:09.92 panic first die if you panic you'll die I mean that the what happened to you know that chief
01:00:09.92 --> 01:00:15.20 that guy was he got tangled up in some lines and you know then his mask got pulled off and there was
01:00:15.20 --> 01:00:19.60 no getting it there's no getting out like there's no your it's pitch black you know and the
01:00:19.60 --> 01:00:23.36 worst is you know the bioluminous and it's like all that kind of you're like completely blinded
01:00:23.36 --> 01:00:28.24 you know and then working all the way up to a national testing with those guys and doing a
01:00:28.24 --> 01:00:34.96 lot of stuff my fact we had to we were like getting to the point we didn't know we were going
01:00:34.96 --> 01:00:40.16 we didn't know any of the information still you know still classified to this day probably always
01:00:40.16 --> 01:00:45.60 will be and you're just getting sick of the same people you know the same probs same personality

01:00:55.92 --> 01:01:01.20 and I remember finally our chief at the time was like he called a smokers and he got
01:01:01.20 --> 01:01:05.28 big trouble because he's like okay this is it we got to settle these beef before really even
01:01:05.28 --> 01:01:12.32 of what you like well at first I didn't really have problems with anybody I was gonna just like
01:01:12.32 --> 01:01:18.000 whatever and so you want a new guy when this was going on yeah it's your first first
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.48 that's freaking savage you guys and so I was like you know I'm super moto guy like I was just like
01:01:24.48 --> 01:01:30.88 so fired up and did you know what you were getting into into when you got assigned STVs?

01:01:34.88 --> 01:01:40.16 covering grease and like squirting out of like a sewage pipe or whatever old school you know
01:01:40.16 --> 01:01:47.60 but that's that's really all I knew about I had no idea and yeah so like he had calls a smokers and
01:01:47.60 --> 01:01:51.92 we're getting ready to leave and he's like hey we're gonna put the board up here officers and

01:02:11.12 --> 01:02:15.68 gonna go and box other people yeah that's what I'm like no there was like tough back in the
01:02:15.68 --> 01:02:19.60 day but it was a great let me tell you something it leveled the scores between a lot of people
01:02:19.60 --> 01:02:23.44 and I didn't it's so everybody like got up and the other right your name on the board with the guy
01:02:23.44 --> 01:02:28.32 that you wanted to fight and of course like some guys jumped up right away and like wrote the
01:02:28.32 --> 01:02:33.68 guys named down it and I just kind of sat back I'm like and then the student gets up and he's one of
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:40.000 the divers and he writes my name on the board I was like I didn't know yeah like a problem so I was like
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.08 so we go he didn't know you freaking box and jet jet in your little well I've wore all my shit so
01:02:46.08 --> 01:02:50.24 we like so everybody starts coming to me and they're like hey like help me out they're all nervous
01:02:50.24 --> 01:02:55.60 now so I'm working with some guys a week goes by it's like a Friday night or something we show up there
01:02:56.16 --> 01:03:02.08 and and I wore like my old boxing trunks I had like no custom gloves I got all my stuff no
01:03:02.08 --> 01:03:06.64 had gear I didn't want anything out of my gold teeth like about a piece and I put it out of my
01:03:06.64 --> 01:03:12.48 coat and so when I was in the medic course I actually was Sparim Partner for Ray Mercer
01:03:13.76 --> 01:03:18.48 yeah that kind of ended my hopes of like thinking that I was gonna be like great some
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:26.000 I don't you know you know I mean I like we just kind of think like but I like the back track a little bit
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.48 I started boxing again while I was going through the medic course and for Bradford year and
01:03:30.48 --> 01:03:36.64 I ended up fighting in the North Carolina State Prison so boxing like guys like Bernard Hopkins and
01:03:36.64 --> 01:03:41.12 then they come up out of the prison programs and so I went in there and went through all the
01:03:41.12 --> 01:03:44.88 security stuff whatever and I fight like a you know various rounds kind of like a
01:03:45.84 --> 01:03:52.32 tournament style and I ended up winning to like the top guy well we was a draw with the top guy and he was like
01:03:52.32 --> 01:03:58.64 the scariest I'm telling you he was like the biggest scariest dude he was doing like 17 in the
01:03:58.64 --> 01:04:04.64 life and Ray Mercer was there and so his coach saw me boxing or whatever and was like hey
01:04:04.64 --> 01:04:08.32 Ray's like getting back in the game what he did and ended up fighting like Tim Silvia
01:04:08.32 --> 01:04:14.48 oh that's right crushed his face and Ray Mercer people remember like that guy was an animal
01:04:14.48 --> 01:04:18.08 beast he was so unfortunate lost a Kimbo slice
01:04:18.88 --> 01:04:24.000 Ray Mercer dude yeah in MMA yeah but the funny thing is they didn't box
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.36 like somehow I think if I remember right Kimbo slice got him in a guillotine and Ray and Ray was like
01:04:31.36 --> 01:04:37.92 I don't know what this is but I thought we were gonna fight yeah yeah like that we're gonna fight so
01:04:38.32 --> 01:04:42.96 yeah so like I started I was so did you go like a camp with them or you just follow me so I started
01:04:42.96 --> 01:04:48.48 boxing with him on the weekends like smart partner getting them in shape and so you know I grew up
01:04:48.48 --> 01:04:52.88 watching Ray Mercer you know he devastated town in Morris and he lost the landing slow as he was a brutal
01:04:52.88 --> 01:04:58.56 dude he never been knocked down he had a head like a you know like a giant block of cheese and
01:04:59.36 --> 01:05:04.80 he was merciless I mean if you watch that knockout against Tim Morrison who was like my hero at the
01:05:04.80 --> 01:05:12.32 time before he got AIDS and but like I mean when he beat him down I remember he said he's like you
01:05:12.32 --> 01:05:16.88 can kill somebody in boxing he that's like all he said it was like very like that like
01:05:16.88 --> 01:05:22.88 does he okay or anything and when he lost the landing slow switch was controversial actually um
01:05:22.88 --> 01:05:27.52 I kind of ended his career had some more fights like along the way but um when he hit Tim Silvia he
01:05:27.52 --> 01:05:32.88 he came just whole head in I mean he if you watch that clip on YouTube I mean it's brutal so
01:05:33.44 --> 01:05:38.24 I'm in there boxing with him I have a couple great shots of me and him boxing together and he hit me so hard one time
01:05:39.20 --> 01:05:42.96 that for the first time I'm like I had like kneeled down the ground I wasn't really sure like
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:48.80 I'm on like roller skates like I and I I remember I was like hurt for like week and I'm starting
01:05:48.80 --> 01:05:54.000 thinking to my head like man this is how like people are hitting like this level I don't
01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000 I think I'll die like because I don't have a huge neck I don't know I just got like more of like a
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.04 noodle neck like no matter how hard I wear it I need to iron neck or whatever but um yeah so I
01:06:07.04 --> 01:06:11.68 so I I boxed with him and then I just just stayed in shape you know whenever we didn't once I left
01:06:11.68 --> 01:06:16.08 there I had three amateur fights and then boxed with Ray then whatever went in the teams and so
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:21.52 we show up at the smokers and so I got all my trunks I got all my stuff I got my shoes on my little
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:27.84 tassels and everything and I got the whole thing in there and he's looking at me over there with his
01:06:27.84 --> 01:06:33.84 like you know I don't know off-brand boxing gloves or whatever and he just comes over he's like
01:06:33.84 --> 01:06:40.16 hey man that's just I don't I don't I don't know why I signed up for the I don't really have a problem
01:06:40.16 --> 01:06:46.96 with you or anything like that it's just are we good like you're dead and we got in there and
01:06:46.96 --> 01:06:50.48 I let him like punch me around for like 30 seconds I hit him one time knocked him out
01:06:51.60 --> 01:06:57.12 cold and so the shout out of my chief because like he had a big trouble because some guys got hurt
01:06:57.12 --> 01:07:01.76 and they couldn't die because they're because you know there knows his and he was like dude dude
01:07:01.76 --> 01:07:08.32 he's got beat up so yeah so it was it was a good experience you know I uh really really fortunate
01:07:08.32 --> 01:07:12.64 that I went there you know it was it was a unique experience and then I then seven days later
01:07:12.64 --> 01:07:18.72 well while underway I got told those getting getting all of that and two tf 373 so
01:07:18.72 --> 01:07:25.28 and where did you go for that? I went damn neck and I did like a train up with them and then
01:07:25.28 --> 01:07:31.60 went deaf gain of sin to an outstations and that was at the point that one was rough that one
01:07:31.60 --> 01:07:39.20 we lost Josh Harris so I was with him when he died I was right next to him and then Jason
01:07:39.20 --> 01:07:47.44 Free Walden and John Markham so that was a tough one and so you know that was my first experience
01:07:47.44 --> 01:07:52.64 in real war you know I mean what I had just come off though like the implications were so high like
01:07:52.64 --> 01:08:00.24 the intensity that if anything went wrong like literally no one's coming to get you like you know
01:08:00.24 --> 01:08:06.88 it's uh not gonna be good so but it was completely different you know uh then being shot at
01:08:06.88 --> 01:08:13.68 in the desert so um yeah was uh that was a really good experience and then it kind of just like you
01:08:13.68 --> 01:08:18.56 know up to my aspirations it got to work with some incredible people and uh do a lot of really
01:08:18.56 --> 01:08:22.72 cool missions and kind of do the stuff that I had been hoping to do from when I was sitting there
01:08:22.72 --> 01:08:27.68 at 9-11 and had an you know an envision of what I was gonna do you know what were you guys doing
01:08:27.68 --> 01:08:34.48 like pretty much just DAs yeah what's that what you're doing do a DAs uh a lot of like SRs and stuff
01:08:34.48 --> 01:08:38.56 like that a lot of overwatches for the army you know in various areas where I had a lot of remote
01:08:38.56 --> 01:08:45.12 outstations and then we were with the um the people that I later went on a work for uh we were kind of
01:08:45.12 --> 01:08:51.20 the military component for them so and so the off-temp was high. off-temp was high was 2008 so
01:08:51.20 --> 01:08:56.56 and you're just living the dream. living the dream like I mean ride in dirt bikes like I was just like
01:08:56.56 --> 01:09:02.72 living the dream uh and then uh when Josh died you know that was my first experience with losing
01:09:02.72 --> 01:09:10.32 somebody and then it just was like really real to me you know it just everything changed after that
01:09:10.32 --> 01:09:19.92 for me um and that that mission was you know he drowned uh so that was uh the way that whole thing
01:09:19.92 --> 01:09:23.68 went down how that that was tough that was that was a tough one and then the guys that were with us
01:09:23.68 --> 01:09:30.32 you know uh chasing got killed on entry uh he got shot in the stomach and then John Mark and
01:09:30.32 --> 01:09:36.72 we got shot in the neck on that so that was a huge loss in 2008 you know for the teams so
01:09:36.72 --> 01:09:44.08 so when you when you say you say like things changed or you changed or it changed what was what was
01:09:44.08 --> 01:09:50.88 like the change was it hey all of a sudden oh we're not immortal what was the change that you were
01:09:50.88 --> 01:09:56.40 yeah I think that was it like I think I had this like I had this like immortality idea in my head
01:09:57.36 --> 01:10:00.000 or I could outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart outsmart out
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.28 do anything and then uh the realism when someone's wrapped in a flag on a helicopter you know
01:10:07.28 --> 01:10:12.80 has a young guy I was just like the implications were so high I have a great picture at my house
01:10:13.44 --> 01:10:16.40 I don't have a lot of military stuff at my house I have stuff in my office but
01:10:16.40 --> 01:10:22.72 because I don't want to influence my son you know I try to you know I don't want him to feel that
01:10:22.72 --> 01:10:29.04 you know and um it's a picture that was taken by an OGA guy of me that he sent to me later on
01:10:29.04 --> 01:10:37.68 and I was standing out looking over the corn golf and uh I couldn't believe like where I had come
01:10:37.68 --> 01:10:43.36 from and that I'm like standing here with these people like these men you know like who
01:10:43.36 --> 01:10:49.92 are we're giants to me you know because like I said I became like a historian I read every book
01:10:49.92 --> 01:10:54.24 everything every there's probably not a book on the teams that I didn't read and this was before like
01:10:54.24 --> 01:10:58.72 a lot of books were coming out they're like old school books and I really believe like in the
01:10:58.72 --> 01:11:05.60 brotherhood like in the old school like do everything together kind of mentality uh
01:11:05.60 --> 01:11:12.000 matter if I could be herel he's like an old school team guy uh and he was like I never forget we're
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.16 like sent drinking beer one down as a new guy and he's like he's like you and you know
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:21.36 the other guys like you guys are like the spirit of like the old teams like the old teams like
01:11:21.36 --> 01:11:30.000 just and I I mean I was I like lived it I loved it and um so you know going to actual war
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.36 though it's very humbling you know and it kind of puts you like in a place where you realize like
01:11:35.36 --> 01:11:42.40 this is like super dangerous because to be honest with you I didn't really think that way at the time you know
01:11:44.64 --> 01:11:51.68 real quick Kirby or else story because it's just awesome he's he was on the podcast and he's
01:11:51.68 --> 01:12:00.16 talking about the Phoenix program and he's like yeah he goes so he we'd we'd go up and I was talking
01:12:00.16 --> 01:12:05.36 to him because you know I have a little bit of perspective of like what doing missions or like so I was
01:12:05.36 --> 01:12:12.24 like so so how would you know what what like hot you're going into an village and he's like oh well
01:12:12.24 --> 01:12:16.000 I would I would have source tell you like H3 huts down on the right and he's like yep that's what
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.20 happened I go that's cool and so there's one op there in a in a little sandpan him and one other guy
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.44 and they go into this village and he and so he's telling the story and he goes yeah you know so I went in
01:12:29.44 --> 01:12:34.96 there and went into the third hut on the right or whatever it was knock the guy out I come out
01:12:34.96 --> 01:12:39.92 throw him in the boat and so I'm thinking I'm like that's cool and I go I go uh how did you knock
01:12:39.92 --> 01:12:44.56 him out he goes and he goes without misnabee I go I go how did you knock him out he goes ball peen hammer
01:12:46.88 --> 01:12:51.12 so like he's even as a webgyer he's got a ball peen hammer and it's freaking webgyer just
01:12:51.12 --> 01:12:59.04 whack it dude at the head and that's that's so bad that's so bad ass oh that was the man we're ironing
01:12:59.04 --> 01:13:05.84 the ships were wood how long was that deployment to Afghanistan that you uh I think we were so
01:13:05.84 --> 01:13:11.28 four months yeah months like working up in Rani and then when you still actually technically attached
01:13:11.28 --> 01:13:18.08 to SDV and there TAD yep yep that was our TAD so so when you got done with that deployment what happened
01:13:18.08 --> 01:13:27.04 I went into uh while I went into another bouton like basically I got home my girlfriend now wife

01:16:41.60 --> 01:16:50.08 about how mad I was I was being possible from a getting mad or like I would explode so I go through
01:16:50.08 --> 01:16:56.56 you know I go through that I hurt my hand and and and up rolling out of that bulltune right before
01:16:56.56 --> 01:17:04.000 the tasking I got a pretty severe arterial injury in my hand and so then I go to like he said
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:10.000 go to trade at 86 and go to trade at this is like STV trade at or did you go to
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.16 it was like standoff weapons that we had it was like no it was like STV trade at
01:17:14.80 --> 01:17:19.68 truth never forget what it's called something so you're still at STV yeah but you're in the training
01:17:19.68 --> 01:17:23.28 I'm in the training part of it's all like going to Seattle lot and you know working over in
01:17:23.28 --> 01:17:29.68 those regions or whatever and then then I got out because and then I tried to screen for
01:17:30.56 --> 01:17:36.80 while I went into the reserves immediately and then tried to screen for CAG and the reserve unit
01:17:36.80 --> 01:17:41.52 wouldn't let me go so then I try to go from the reserve unit I remember the mesh chief at the time
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:46.88 and he wanted me to go sell res for two years and serve my time at the reserves before I can go
01:17:46.88 --> 01:17:50.56 because this isn't going to be a stepping stone everything I was trying to do is try to get the
01:17:50.56 --> 01:17:56.24 opportunity to go over there so then I ended up I want to say his name because he ended up
01:17:56.24 --> 01:18:00.48 getting a lot of trouble but I ended up meeting getting picked up and doing a job and I rack
01:18:00.48 --> 01:18:05.68 for during the I think it was a status of forces agreement that was going on at the time
01:18:06.24 --> 01:18:10.48 doing like PSD stuff so now you're a contractor so now I'm a contractor still still
01:18:10.48 --> 01:18:14.72 deserves but you're a contractor yeah and I was like picking up schools and stuff and going to
01:18:14.72 --> 01:18:18.72 schools or whatever and trying to like figure out I could like weasel my way like back into
01:18:18.72 --> 01:18:25.28 active duty that's all I wanted to do and I was just really got out of pure spite I was just
01:18:25.28 --> 01:18:30.80 so angry like and I looked back at like my state and I was like man like luckily I'm like a
01:18:30.80 --> 01:18:36.40 fairly I mean that sounded like it but I'm like a steady-headed person because I was like really like
01:18:37.28 --> 01:18:41.92 a roller coaster of emotions like I had I had just experienced all this stuff and in a nutshell
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:49.76 and next thing you know I'm like felt like I was being shitted on you know so I am in Iraq and I'm
01:18:49.76 --> 01:18:54.16 like standing at the greed being and I see a guy who knows me and he starts talking he's like oh hey
01:18:54.16 --> 01:19:00.08 what are you doing I was like I told him when I was doing he's like give me your email I got another
01:19:00.08 --> 01:19:08.24 job for you and so I ended up going over to a contractor for the say I had and I did like almost
01:19:08.24 --> 01:19:15.12 four years over there and did you go what what did that you know from what you can say that's cool to
01:19:15.12 --> 01:19:20.56 say was that did you get some immediate training or they like hey you're good on your training
01:19:20.56 --> 01:19:25.28 what would you have to do? I was the only team guy that made it out of the training me and three
01:19:25.28 --> 01:19:31.92 other guys first of all I didn't really like I had an idea but he wouldn't tell me anything and I
01:19:31.92 --> 01:19:36.96 got how it went down was like I got a random email being like you know you've been like recommended
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:43.60 for training can you be here on whatever the date was and I was in Iraq so I remember I went to
01:19:43.60 --> 01:19:47.84 this guy I was like a total toolbag he was like some like army guy or something and I was like oh hey
01:19:47.84 --> 01:19:52.96 I got to like get out of here I got like family health problem and he's like you can't leave here
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:56.32 I was like I'll walk right out of this gate and I'll get on that airplane and I'm like you know
01:19:56.32 --> 01:20:02.80 own me I'll do it over at a woman so finally like they like they made me fly come air so I'm like
01:20:02.80 --> 01:20:09.60 like I do whatever I want because I was like I'm taking this job like I want this job and so
01:20:09.60 --> 01:20:15.20 I couldn't have got either made it's training so I ended up flying calm air out and I'm like
01:20:15.20 --> 01:20:19.76 rethinking everything I was a month ago like the bag that airport like there's no orange
01:20:19.76 --> 01:20:28.000 Julius is there and and I'm like one of these guys is not like the others so I fly back
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:35.68 and two days later I'm in training and uh and I'm at a undisclosed facility and it's like
01:20:36.80 --> 01:20:43.20 go top like can you perform like show up here on the line nobody talk nobody's saying anything like
01:20:43.20 --> 01:20:51.60 nobody's like I'm in this like vending and it's like four or five weeks all over in various locations
01:20:51.60 --> 01:20:58.24 and uh I show up it was really funny because I'm checking in the hotel and one of the states and of course
01:20:58.24 --> 01:21:02.88 I'm in the lobby and I look around it's like typical contractors like you know huge like
01:21:02.88 --> 01:21:11.12 America flag had some beers like everyone's like low-prow up. Clearly like we're all here together you know
01:21:11.12 --> 01:21:17.76 everyone's going everyone brother like and like even the even the guy at the front does
01:21:17.76 --> 01:21:25.04 give a brother and and so we check into the we check we check in and and my roommate is a team guy
01:21:25.04 --> 01:21:32.08 bunny in mind and so as we're like in like he's like a good buddy of mine and I didn't even know
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:40.16 he was there so we're there and he didn't make it but the so I get a text message from over
01:21:40.16 --> 01:21:48.96 sea is like watch the news tonight okay been loud and goes down and I'm in the hotel like no way you know and of
01:21:48.96 --> 01:21:54.16 course you know then you got all you got all the sea of experts on there and describing exactly how they did it like
01:21:55.36 --> 01:21:59.28 it was like it was like the uh there's like the captain Philips thing you know that had that dude
01:21:59.28 --> 01:22:04.24 like I forget it was like branded weather something that it was like a watermelon like swoop swinging
01:22:04.24 --> 01:22:08.64 slowly and he's like shooting it with a 50-kow like showing how like difficult it would have been
01:22:08.64 --> 01:22:14.32 to hit the watermelon but so I'm like glued to the news show up the next morning we got like selection
01:22:14.32 --> 01:22:20.72 starts and um you know PT tests all those kind of things and the quals were super hard shooting
01:22:20.72 --> 01:22:27.44 quals yeah they were very difficult like that's what got most people was the quals and then the
01:22:27.44 --> 01:22:34.24 CQB um I mean it's and then they never like there's no coaching there's no like if you don't
01:22:34.24 --> 01:22:39.44 make past these tests at this time you're just you just go away like a van just pulls up and you
01:22:39.44 --> 01:22:44.08 just leave there's no like hey bro you think you'd do better next time like I mean I've
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:48.72 what I mean where I was there a cat guy seen guys like everybody and so I get to the end there's only
01:22:49.68 --> 01:22:55.76 four of us left and now I'm kind of figuring I'm in a total state of paranoia too because
01:22:55.76 --> 01:23:00.08 every move I ever watched about the CIA is like playing in my head you know I like turned the
01:23:00.08 --> 01:23:04.24 sink out of me for like a cable to come out like look at me and write everything like everything
01:23:04.24 --> 01:23:08.48 everybody is like everybody's on it which is kind of funny because what I went through this
01:23:08.48 --> 01:23:16.40 surveillance course and I actually got busted by like a big fat lady in a KFC she like busted me
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:23.68 so I was like you know there is those kind of people I was doing like some countering surveillance
01:23:23.68 --> 01:23:32.88 thing and I was I was in San Diego and I was all dressed up like a bum and and I'm like sitting there
01:23:32.88 --> 01:23:39.52 and I'm all freaking dirty and shitty and and I got busted and I got busted because I had my
01:23:39.52 --> 01:23:46.64 watch on and like you know this you know it's like whoever we were surveilling whatever it was surveilling
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:51.28 the surveillance or whatever and like we got back to the briefing they're like hey you know
01:23:51.28 --> 01:23:57.12 Jaco freaking nice watch they're like you got rolled up because that you know everyone
01:23:57.12 --> 01:24:01.36 everyone was like look you look like a bum with this freaking uh Iron Man watch on this
01:24:01.36 --> 01:24:06.72 this is the healthiest bum ever yeah this was before everyone had like the big
01:24:06.72 --> 01:24:11.84 tactical watches that everybody has now yeah but back in the day I guess this was sort of like a big
01:24:11.84 --> 01:24:20.16 tactical watch for a second so yeah the old school that's funny so not so only a few you get through
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:23.92 this mega through yeah and so some of the guys got the opportunity to try you know they were good
01:24:23.92 --> 01:24:28.40 dudes and they hadn't tried again but the quals were like I mean were you always a good shooter
01:24:28.96 --> 01:24:34.48 yeah I was always a good shooter I don't not that I grew up like you know you're hunting like
01:24:34.48 --> 01:24:39.84 like I always laugh because now I'm like big archery hunter and stuff and and actually a hunter
01:24:39.84 --> 01:24:43.84 but we're in high growth like hunting was like you know shooting out of the back of a truck and like
01:24:43.84 --> 01:24:48.88 you're like an accord field and like you know like that was hunting like you know like our hunting
01:24:48.88 --> 01:24:54.56 gear was like you know like one of these snow suit like you bought a wall crack yeah exactly and
01:24:54.56 --> 01:25:00.88 a six bag was like Bubba um but you must have good hand eye coordination from maybe from boxing
01:25:00.88 --> 01:25:05.92 in there just going there knock the shit out of a course like that that's a legit yeah the pistol
01:25:05.92 --> 01:25:10.80 I mean the pistol shooting was like they had this one called the run down uh so it was
01:25:11.92 --> 01:25:17.92 you lined up on the 100 all right and then you would sprint to the 200 drop down two shots prone
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:22.48 and then you'd sprint it no no no this is rifle so I thought you were talking pistol I was like
01:25:22.48 --> 01:25:32.000 day off now this is no no it's like you're at French double over nine so um no but this was a
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.92 tough one so it's full kit on and then you'd start you had to have six mags and with two
01:25:35.92 --> 01:25:41.60 rounds in each mag you'd start at the 100 sprint to the 200 drop down two shots prone then sprint
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:48.96 to the 100 two shots kneeling then sprint to the 50 two shot standing then to the 25 two
01:25:48.96 --> 01:25:53.52 headshots then to the 7 two headshots mag change in between everyone you had two minutes and
01:25:53.52 --> 01:26:01.76 minimum score 24 and a epic um that got a lot of guys and then six seconds four shots from the
01:26:01.76 --> 01:26:07.28 concealed 25 yards on the pistol so that was and you can't miss real that's kind of
01:26:07.28 --> 01:26:11.68 it's good and then there's like you know again by time you get through all that then you got like
01:26:11.68 --> 01:26:16.08 CQB so I'm like and this is the interesting thing about this is no work up it's not like you went
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:20.72 through you came off some shooting school or you like okay hey let's get you guys all dialed
01:26:20.72 --> 01:26:24.96 in here's your test this is like hey welcome here's your test yes and you're you're basically
01:26:24.96 --> 01:26:30.16 testing the whole time because it's like a vetting and uh I was really funny because we show up
01:26:30.16 --> 01:26:36.08 and we're at like the uh the Duane Deeter thing so I thought I was done with that because I went to
01:26:36.08 --> 01:26:41.20 that mosquito you know okay you hit me have the thing in her it's a time I know this is deadly like
01:26:41.20 --> 01:26:45.84 but you know how to get into the most level one everyone's a level three it depends who you know
01:26:45.84 --> 01:26:50.64 if you got somebody a me head they're gonna hit you with it so I'm thinking I'm done with that I show
01:26:50.64 --> 01:26:57.52 up there and I'm like oh no I karate chops to the head like so we go through all that stuff we
01:26:57.52 --> 01:27:02.08 had done there's another series of calls at the end you finish that off and then you get off
01:27:02.08 --> 01:27:07.12 and a job and get ready start to point and then every two years you have to redo it
01:27:08.32 --> 01:27:14.88 and if you fail you're done so there's like this looming pressure of like I have to redo all
01:27:14.88 --> 01:27:20.000 these things and then it gets more like I went through that and then it gets more like training
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.96 there's like you still have to crawl but there's more training involved but that the initial one
01:27:24.96 --> 01:27:28.80 was just the vetting out and that was tough that was some of the toughest training that I
01:27:28.80 --> 01:27:35.60 went through so now you get to that job and you're starting to conduct operations obviously there's
01:27:35.60 --> 01:27:40.40 only so much we can say about the operations you know where you're conducting him and kind of what
01:27:40.40 --> 01:27:46.24 you're doing but broadly speaking what was your what was your tasking yeah so a tasking was to
01:27:47.44 --> 01:27:53.12 protect you know see I a person out you know around the world they conduct their missions
01:27:53.12 --> 01:28:00.000 so it's intense and you work all the time there is no more atory out and there is no standing down
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.04 there is no you know you're employed and it's one season two z's and then there's also like the
01:28:07.04 --> 01:28:11.60 high-vis military side we're doing the paramilitary stuff depending on what basis you're at so
01:28:12.32 --> 01:28:16.96 as a team leader in a couple of bases where it's like full on I mean it's full on military
01:28:16.96 --> 01:28:24.000 like you're you know you got a whole you got a whole team of guys underneath you and yeah it's uh
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.32 looking at it from that side and looking at it from the military side is just so different like
01:28:30.32 --> 01:28:36.64 it's unbelievable and so yeah was uh or team of guys that you're talking about are not Americans
01:28:36.64 --> 01:28:42.64 yeah not Americans yeah and and you know people can say what they want about those guys and I
01:28:42.64 --> 01:28:47.04 wouldn't say I trusted all of them but you really develop a relationship you know you you rely on
01:28:47.04 --> 01:28:52.08 these guys and you know watching Afghanistan fall and it was hard you know it was hard
01:28:52.08 --> 01:28:58.40 matter fact I met some of the guys recently that got out of the country last month they reached out
01:28:58.40 --> 01:29:03.44 to me and they're here somewhere living in the refugee camp basically and they were telling
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:07.44 me about what happened to a bunch of our guys I mean helping us the walls shishkabab
01:29:07.44 --> 01:29:13.52 spears stuff through their hearts you know I mean like brutally killed so it was uh it was tough
01:29:13.52 --> 01:29:18.000 uh a good relationship with those guys so some of them are here in the states actually
01:29:18.88 --> 01:29:24.08 funny enough like what I'm like I don't know they don't we don't use our names but one of the
01:29:24.08 --> 01:29:30.56 guys somehow like found me and like reached out to like my secretary like I was like my name is like
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:33.92 someone's so my homied like you know looking for Mike and they said it to me I'm like
01:29:33.92 --> 01:29:43.60 take everything off the internet like yeah that's bizarre it is bizarre and you know it was uh
01:29:44.80 --> 01:29:51.20 I sat down for a matter fact what happened was I was I won't say where I was but I was in a
01:29:51.20 --> 01:29:59.52 state for work a month ago my plane gets canceled so I'm like kind of wandering around like oh my god
01:29:59.52 --> 01:30:03.36 I got like forgetting another hotel I do all this up I walk into the parking garage and I hear
01:30:03.36 --> 01:30:09.60 somebody calling me by my call sign but of course like my spidey sense is like just per cup I
01:30:09.60 --> 01:30:14.64 don't know a lot of people that know that and I like turned and Logan it's two of my guys like
01:30:14.64 --> 01:30:22.000 where I was the team leader of that place for three deployments and uh and he's like you know I'm like
01:30:23.20 --> 01:30:28.80 like what's happening right now so I ended up like going back to their house with them
01:30:28.80 --> 01:30:36.24 and having dinner at this which is like it's a wicked refugee camp I just ran into them at the
01:30:36.24 --> 01:30:41.84 airport all right so I sit down and we go off I'll show you some pictures of me with them but uh yeah
01:30:41.84 --> 01:30:47.92 they started telling me like what happened to all these guys I mean dude it's like that guy is all
01:30:47.92 --> 01:30:52.40 these ever done since he was 20 years old was work for the Americans my family's been killed
01:30:52.40 --> 01:31:00.000 houses burned down people have been beheaded I mean they've been tortured I mean it's it's it's rough
01:31:01.60 --> 01:31:08.80 this the amount of people that worked with American Afghanistan is like a massive number it's a massive
01:31:08.80 --> 01:31:12.80 number to think like oh well there's only a small amount of people that are gonna bear the burden it's like
01:31:12.80 --> 01:31:17.76 there's a massive number of people that work with Americans well if you look at uh you know kind of
01:31:17.76 --> 01:31:22.96 in my work with my foundation um if you look at the number of people that have served in the war
01:31:22.96 --> 01:31:30.000 Americans right 2.7 million Americans served in the global war in terrorism 20 years all right so 7,000
01:31:30.80 --> 01:31:37.76 died in the war over 20 years 1500 are amputated so that's 0.002026 percent
01:31:39.28 --> 01:31:46.40 0.0056 percent are those who have died right and then you look at the fallout though from the
01:31:46.40 --> 01:31:51.28 war so we just we look at those hard numbers right but we don't look at the cost of it and you look at
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:56.64 only 4.5 percent of them are 10 you know American veterans tempting star businesses would be
01:31:56.64 --> 01:32:02.56 out to a pernors you know there's 50,000 non-profits in North America 2 and 6 veterans on you know
01:32:02.56 --> 01:32:10.80 psychiatric medications and between 2005 and the end of 2025 25,000 guys have killed themselves
01:32:10.80 --> 01:32:16.40 so people will say well you know some of those guys were other vats or whatever you know that
01:32:16.40 --> 01:32:22.08 didn't serve in there there were Vietnam vats or it doesn't matter like that's a huge number
01:32:22.08 --> 01:32:28.32 that's every 64 minutes and so we look at those numbers on the fallout on American culture
01:32:29.44 --> 01:32:35.84 and then you got to look at the fallout on the on the host nation culture and that that will be
01:32:35.84 --> 01:32:44.56 felt for generations like and then what we did like I don't mean we but like what our nation did like
01:32:44.56 --> 01:32:53.36 we're no longer like a force of righteousness and of good like we are we are colonialists that
01:32:53.36 --> 01:32:57.84 have just destroyed the foundation in fabric and our fact I was talking to Andy said like
01:32:58.64 --> 01:33:02.88 what is it 98 percent of all people have guessed I didn't know who someone been a lot of
01:33:02.88 --> 01:33:08.80 was and didn't know 9-11 and have it right so so we just think about our cost of war
01:33:09.60 --> 01:33:15.52 but then you got to look at the long term cost of what's the displacement within societies and
01:33:16.24 --> 01:33:20.88 it's going to come home to roost I mean I was listening to there was a general who supported us when
01:33:20.88 --> 01:33:27.68 I worked on the other side of the house he was a badass my effect I have a teacher with his face on it
01:33:27.68 --> 01:33:33.20 I worked out with it all the time he was that he was a real he was committed to the cause and he was
01:33:33.20 --> 01:33:40.000 he was just just a band in them and they they tore these guys told me they just tortured them
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.92 viciously and this is a guy that for for 15 years 15 years dedicated his whole life to our nation
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:52.56 and they you know they told me what they did what they did to him and I was just like
01:33:52.56 --> 01:34:02.48 oh man it's not like there's a cost there's a huge cost you know I think the cost is felt on
01:34:02.48 --> 01:34:11.92 our our soldiers here you know I think that the enemy that we're fighting is not it's not like
01:34:11.92 --> 01:34:16.96 it's not like you know they're not like Chinese or like Russians you know these guys didn't have
01:34:16.96 --> 01:34:22.24 drones they didn't have bombers they don't have any that kind of stuff you know they they had
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:28.16 you know weapons that were you know that they took from the Russians the 70s and run around
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:35.76 a flip-flops and like pajamas and and the ones that fought alongside of us believed in us that we
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:43.12 they took us at our word that we would you know that we would honor our commitment to them as a
01:34:43.12 --> 01:34:47.84 people and as a nation and think about the girls and going to school and the children and
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:54.96 my heart breaks for it there's nothing I can do I'm a pawn I'm a minion like it in the scope of
01:34:54.96 --> 01:35:03.84 things but but I you know I think that the karma is gonna come home it's gonna hunt this nation
01:35:03.84 --> 01:35:08.80 you know I think you look I look at my little children I got you know my fifth kid about to be born
01:35:08.80 --> 01:35:19.60 and I think about what is 50 years look like right 50 years it's gonna come home it's gonna come home
01:35:19.60 --> 01:35:22.96 to us and you could see the hurt and you know what these guys I'm sitting there you didn't
01:35:22.96 --> 01:35:26.32 with them I'm eating the footbred I'm sitting in there of course I'm waiting for someone to come
01:35:26.32 --> 01:35:31.36 out and stab like a ventan in the side of my head like I cannot believe I'm in this situation but
01:35:31.36 --> 01:35:37.44 I share these pictures of like I'm like I can't first of all they're in like I'm Jack poverty
01:35:37.44 --> 01:35:43.36 all right they're like in these refugee camps where it's like no wheels on the vehicles shit everywhere
01:35:44.56 --> 01:35:50.80 and like here here you go thanks for helping us out and you know I just uh
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000 you know I have a heart for people that's my life my life is people and I see that hurt whether
01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.96 they're you know afghani or american or whatever um I see the hurt because it adds the global
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:08.48 collective you know and you can everybody can feel it they can feel the whole world changing right now
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:12.64 and you know I think that hammer is gonna come home I think it's gonna hit us right the face
01:36:18.64 --> 01:36:26.64 that's so how long did you continue to work um doing that job with OGA
01:36:26.64 --> 01:36:35.12 yeah so I yeah I did it for almost four years and uh and what was the uptemp
01:36:35.12 --> 01:36:42.48 a half when you'd going on a pump out off of your home it was I was every 60 days to 90 days depending
01:36:42.48 --> 01:36:48.000 on where I was and what I was doing sometimes I could extend it or whatever um and that's about
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.08 all you could take of that job before you just got completely burned out so it's uh 60 90 day deployment
01:36:56.08 --> 01:37:04.72 30 days home and then 30 days home mm-hmm is it yeah like when you come home how long to take
01:37:04.72 --> 01:37:09.28 you to reset and freaking enjoy your life before you're like well I gotta go back again and
01:37:09.28 --> 01:37:15.92 four days or whatever you don't you don't I never get out of that zone I would come home uh and be
01:37:18.16 --> 01:37:24.24 I was so intense you know I was I wasn't an intense person and I didn't have I wasn't on the face
01:37:24.24 --> 01:37:31.20 but I didn't I didn't live that my whole life was isolated I had like the same friends like the same
01:37:31.52 --> 01:37:38.32 people you know the same job I I didn't like I wasn't out there my I would come home and I would be
01:37:38.32 --> 01:37:44.08 very distracted like I because I always knew that I had to like leave again and then in um in
01:37:44.08 --> 01:37:54.24 2014 I was in a really significant ordeal um I would say it was like up there in my top two or three
01:37:54.24 --> 01:38:00.96 events I had in my you know military-parameter career was uh actually I would say it's probably the
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:08.56 top like it was the most insane gunfire and combat and carnage that I ever been involved and
01:38:08.56 --> 01:38:16.16 um you know that's when I kind of was like enough was enough from I had enough at that point you know so
01:38:17.52 --> 01:38:24.40 that's kind of when my whole world fell apart really because I didn't have that anchor anymore
01:38:24.40 --> 01:38:30.48 and that that had become my identity like when that identity went away you know I was kind of left
01:38:30.48 --> 01:38:37.20 spiral with all these experiences and skills and things and now I had no mission no purpose like
01:38:37.20 --> 01:38:45.60 uh well what was different about that event that I mean you'd had your buddies been killed before
01:38:45.60 --> 01:38:51.12 you'd done missions where there's a ton of pressure you've been in gun fights like what what why
01:38:51.12 --> 01:38:56.56 was that particular event the straw that broke the camels back because there's no community
01:38:57.60 --> 01:39:02.88 uh you know you're a gun for a higher and there's no community it's not like I come home and
01:39:02.88 --> 01:39:08.24 I'm like with the team and with all my buddies I'm in my platoon I got the people I got the things I got
01:39:08.24 --> 01:39:14.40 this culture I show up and I'm with different people from different units I got two guys here
01:39:14.40 --> 01:39:20.72 and a green beret here and a you know a CCD guy here I you know and you become friends and you yeah
01:39:20.72 --> 01:39:24.88 there was a brotherhood but then I mean I've never seen I mean I've worked with them again I
01:39:24.88 --> 01:39:28.88 may be over here you know so that so when you go home it's kind of just like oh you're just like
01:39:28.88 --> 01:39:36.48 you just get on the airplane I mean when I came home I flew through DC I still had like you know
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:43.12 pieces of concrete like you know I was still banged up like and I just like arrive home at the airport
01:39:43.12 --> 01:39:49.44 like and then that's just it there's nobody calls this is like you okay like what's going on like
01:39:49.44 --> 01:39:56.16 how's the family like nothing you're just I'm living in a rural area by myself with my wife and
01:39:56.16 --> 01:40:00.88 kids and I'm you know there's I you feel like you have nobody your wife have any idea what's going on
01:40:01.52 --> 01:40:07.44 not I mean yeah I mean I didn't like tell her stuff but she could just tell my
01:40:07.44 --> 01:40:14.32 fact when I left and I and I resigned I um there and there was a lot of reasons for that but
01:40:16.08 --> 01:40:21.52 I remember my my daughter my middle daughter said to me mom always sits in the car and cries
01:40:21.52 --> 01:40:29.20 every day and by herself and I was like and I was like about what you know like so like I went
01:40:29.20 --> 01:40:32.56 over there and I remember I was like where are you crying in the car like what's going on and she's like
01:40:32.56 --> 01:40:40.08 you're just you're so intense like and I didn't say anything I mean I wasn't like chatting it up
01:40:40.08 --> 01:40:47.84 but I just rated it in form of intensity like at any minute I'm ready to go and yeah I mean if it wasn't
01:40:47.84 --> 01:40:53.84 for horses and what I'm doing right now I'm probably I don't know I look at the state of veterans
01:40:53.84 --> 01:41:01.36 today and I don't think that people understand it's a severity of what's happening to our culture
01:41:01.36 --> 01:41:07.76 it's especially like kind of where we come from you know and my my career is a just a fraction of
01:41:08.80 --> 01:41:17.68 you living a lifetime in that you know and but it has a huge impact on you long term and we
01:41:17.68 --> 01:41:24.32 forget about those people and like I was kind of rattling off some of those statistics like I mean
01:41:24.32 --> 01:41:34.000 if you look at having 50,000 nonprofits in North America for vets 50,000 between 2012 and the end of 2020
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:41.68 we spent 92 billion dollars all right the top five non-profits for veterans have billions of dollars all right
01:41:41.68 --> 01:41:48.72 there's organizations in those top five that you know spend $29,000,000 dollars last year on postage stamps
01:41:49.36 --> 01:41:55.92 all right 18 million dollars on TV ads all right the the addiction rate of what I see of guys coming
01:41:55.92 --> 01:42:01.36 and applying to my program a couple hundred a year I can only look at those hard numbers right
01:42:01.36 --> 01:42:07.12 but 75% of those guys are on at least two my maximum guy had come to heroes and horses had
01:42:07.12 --> 01:42:14.56 was on 13 medications last year yet a guy come on 11 medications come off all in lose 37 pounds
01:42:14.56 --> 01:42:20.08 in 41 days in the program right nobody cares about nobody looks at any of those kind of things
01:42:20.08 --> 01:42:25.44 the joblessness the suicide and then there's a conversation about living and being alive
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.76 we say oh this is a success story because you didn't kill himself and I and I looked at guys
01:42:29.76 --> 01:42:35.20 and I told me you're you're your your dead you're ready dead you haven't pulled the trigger but
01:42:35.20 --> 01:42:45.68 you're dead you're not living any form of life and you know if it wasn't if I didn't happen to fall into
01:42:45.68 --> 01:42:50.72 I guess you could say or or be directed I guess Sarah dip itously or you know
01:42:52.96 --> 01:42:55.76 I don't I don't know I don't know because I was a
01:42:55.76 --> 01:43:05.28 I was just I was so wrapped up in anger you know and I felt alone in the world because it's not like
01:43:06.32 --> 01:43:12.40 you don't have anybody around you you're just you're just done you know and you realize like
01:43:13.28 --> 01:43:18.96 you're just you're just a number you are literally if the tool breaks they throw the tool away
01:43:18.96 --> 01:43:23.60 you never hear these stories I could tell you stories about guys that have been shot and
01:43:23.60 --> 01:43:27.44 busted they're you know like a crippled and they can't even pay their bills they're living in a
01:43:27.44 --> 01:43:33.04 one room shack and you know trying to get medical payments like contractors like it's
01:43:33.04 --> 01:43:39.36 um and tie that into their military career it just becomes this cost at cocktail and uh that's why
01:43:39.36 --> 01:43:43.76 I've dedicated my life to this because I think that there's something special whether no matter
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:48.96 what you did in the military that you went and signed up knowing that you could die in the time of war
01:43:48.96 --> 01:43:52.88 and because you believed in something and I think people don't think that means fighting for the
01:43:52.88 --> 01:43:57.84 government but I think it means fighting for your country and fighting for what is good
01:43:58.72 --> 01:44:04.24 and somewhere when that gets lost and gets twisted I think a whole person loses their
01:44:04.24 --> 01:44:10.32 anchor point and they spiral out of control and yeah I mean I
01:44:12.08 --> 01:44:16.32 yeah so that's why today the program that I run is it's so intensive and
01:44:16.32 --> 01:44:23.04 when you got out when you when you left that contracting job did you have a plan?
01:44:24.56 --> 01:44:30.64 No well yeah kind of I guess I left because I remember I was I got home and Christmas Eve
01:44:30.64 --> 01:44:35.84 and I was like putting together all this like my wife picks me up from the airport and I remember
01:44:35.84 --> 01:44:38.72 I'm driving she's driving. Who you're living on the east coast of this country? No I'm living
01:44:38.72 --> 01:44:44.64 Montana and snowing out and she's driving and she just starts like hysterically cry and like
01:44:44.64 --> 01:44:51.68 you know what's your problem and she's like are you okay and I'm like yeah I'm fine and she's like
01:44:51.68 --> 01:44:57.52 I just like I can feel your energy coming off you're like a furnace right now I was like I'm fine
01:44:57.52 --> 01:45:02.24 like and she's like okay like well we got to like you know put the Christmas stuff together
01:45:02.24 --> 01:45:07.28 I got extended so I've been on like a long trip so Christmas Eve I go back and I remember I'm like
01:45:08.08 --> 01:45:14.08 it was the frozen the frozen thing. So you want to talk about Frankenstein?
01:45:14.08 --> 01:45:19.28 I've been like I had the frozen car like I'm trying to put the wheels on like and I remember I was
01:45:19.28 --> 01:45:24.24 shaking so bad and I was like I was just sewing my head because you know after that we
01:45:24.24 --> 01:45:28.88 you know some things happened we got to the suicide bomb went off and all these things that happened
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:35.52 and I remember like I just I couldn't down regulate I mean I just couldn't down regulate
01:45:35.52 --> 01:45:40.64 even just driving in the car I felt like I was there like everything was happening around me
01:45:40.64 --> 01:45:46.48 you know when you said that 30 days coming home for 30 days I can remember coming home off of
01:45:46.48 --> 01:45:53.44 deployments and it takes like a 30 day period to where you're like okay like my first deployment
01:45:53.44 --> 01:45:58.72 to Iraq we were there was this big paranoia about getting you know IE deed when you went
01:45:58.72 --> 01:46:03.44 under bridges or ambush when you went under bridges and so you know you'd always kind of like
01:46:03.44 --> 01:46:09.04 take a little breath before you'd go under a bridge in a in a convoy and I remember when I
01:46:09.04 --> 01:46:13.84 came home you know I'm like I'm not trying to say I was freaking out or anything but
01:46:15.28 --> 01:46:20.56 when I would be driving my car from work back home and go under a bridge it'd be like
01:46:21.20 --> 01:46:24.64 you'd have that just like oh yeah I remember that just this little something in your mind right
01:46:24.64 --> 01:46:29.12 and it would take like a month for me to go away so I'm thinking you're coming home for 30 days
01:46:29.12 --> 01:46:35.92 that's not enough time to get any sort of like to what you say down grade or whatever
01:46:35.92 --> 01:46:42.48 down regular down regular there's no time 30 days is not enough to down regulate period and when
01:46:42.48 --> 01:46:46.32 you're all you're doing is coming home and you know you're going on another deployment in
01:46:46.32 --> 01:46:50.88 that 30 days you might as well I kind of feel like you might as well might even come home
01:46:50.88 --> 01:46:56.64 because it's just what is what good is it gonna do that's freaking crazy it is and it's it's
01:46:56.64 --> 01:47:00.88 it's crazy that the amount of work that's carried out by contractors around the world I don't
01:47:00.88 --> 01:47:05.92 think people understand the scope of it especially when it pertains to like you know the DIA then
01:47:05.92 --> 01:47:13.20 say the CIA like you know these institutions that use contractors yeah it's a it's a tough
01:47:13.20 --> 01:47:19.76 transition for sure and I happen to you know for me like going back to work you know I started
01:47:19.76 --> 01:47:25.12 working on a ranch I met some guys and so I would kind of like immerse myself in that and
01:47:25.12 --> 01:47:31.36 so Christmas Eve yeah so I kind of cut off your story so this is this is you just had this
01:47:31.36 --> 01:47:36.56 sort of what you called the biggest incident in your career yeah I would say one of the top three
01:47:36.56 --> 01:47:43.36 for sure like now you get into the freaking aluminum tube and you've wake up and you're in freaking
01:47:43.36 --> 01:47:50.32 Montana again I'm in Montana and I'm like and I remember I was trying to put I couldn't
01:47:50.32 --> 01:47:57.12 focus to like even put the wheels on the thing I was just so and I remember like I stayed up all night
01:47:57.12 --> 01:48:00.72 you know I got in late I got in basically Christmas morning and like the kids got out of
01:48:00.72 --> 01:48:06.000 of course you know they're like you know American consumerism like I'm not even looking at the
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:12.96 thing ripping stuff stuff like everywhere and I'm like you know the waste like it's all
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:18.96 it's gonna eat that so we're like you know and I remember I'm like trying to cook breakfast that morning and
01:48:18.96 --> 01:48:24.24 I've been up now for I don't know probably 48 hours or something and and I remember cooking
01:48:24.24 --> 01:48:28.24 breakfast and looking at the window and I was like my wife came and we were kind of put her arm on me
01:48:28.24 --> 01:48:33.60 and I'm trying to like be happy and everything but I just looked at her I was like I'm just like
01:48:34.40 --> 01:48:40.24 I need some more time home you know so I emails and say hey I kind of need some time home
01:48:40.24 --> 01:48:46.32 and obviously like this huge thing happened and it was huge and like you know the highest levels
01:48:46.32 --> 01:48:53.52 were involved and came overseas like so like it's not like you know they didn't know or anything
01:48:53.52 --> 01:48:58.80 and and they're like well we like need you to go back like you know take this team bubble
01:48:58.80 --> 01:49:06.80 bond and if you don't come back we're in a doctor pet and that's when I was like back to like my
01:49:06.80 --> 01:49:13.12 massager chief story you know I was like like and and I was just I was just done I really wasn't
01:49:13.76 --> 01:49:21.44 sure I had I had started you know I'd started my foundation and and so then I did a film called
01:49:21.44 --> 01:49:25.92 one EDM you had already started your foundation yeah I had filed the paper work and I hadn't
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:30.40 run anything or done anything yet and so I did you have a vision for what the foundation actually was
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:40.96 yeah and that's evolved significantly to what it is today but yeah so then I ended up in 2015
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:45.36 running my first season which was like come out for two weeks go home come out for two weeks go home
01:49:45.36 --> 01:49:53.52 and so I did a film with the EDM called 180 out and I had met a guy strange I had my wife had this
01:49:53.52 --> 01:49:59.76 like mommy's workout thing I watched a video is a big hunter uh Mark C. cap and uh he was like sick
01:49:59.76 --> 01:50:04.24 because main guy yet he's main guy big artery wrote it he made a video called searching for west
01:50:05.12 --> 01:50:11.60 and it's about him being this prolific archer and how his son's born and he's kind of like
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:16.88 thinking about why he he should be there with him and you know so I watched this video over
01:50:16.88 --> 01:50:20.64 season a bunch of guys and then he's like oh this guy lives in both minutes so I send the video
01:50:20.64 --> 01:50:29.04 in my wife she launches this like mommy's workout thing and his wife comes and strangely enough like
01:50:29.04 --> 01:50:35.44 so I was like this is the guy from the video like this is the hunting guy and so we ended up like meeting
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:40.56 and he goes hey I want to do a video on you uh yety video and he was making all the yety videos at the
01:50:40.56 --> 01:50:46.72 time like a bunch of him and so initially it was about me like being an archery elk hunter or whatever
01:50:47.36 --> 01:50:51.12 and uh and then he got to know me and he's like I want to like do it on your standing up this
01:50:51.12 --> 01:50:58.16 foundation on your first season and that first season was I don't know how that year didn't kill me
01:50:58.16 --> 01:51:03.60 honestly uh I mean it was one of the it was probably the hardest year I've had my entire life
01:51:05.20 --> 01:51:10.96 I got to you know I bought my house basically broke no paycheck I started trimming trees for a guy
01:51:10.96 --> 01:51:16.72 I'm like working on the side like you know my relationship was like touching go I was you know
01:51:16.72 --> 01:51:21.20 started chewing horses I'm trying to bring these vets out I'm self-funding everything
01:51:21.20 --> 01:51:29.84 I have basically down to you know a few thousand dollars in the bank account and uh I ended up meeting
01:51:29.84 --> 01:51:36.16 a gentleman that over over a beer totally randomly for a friend of mine that gave me 25,000 dollar check
01:51:36.88 --> 01:51:42.40 and before it gives me the check and I was 24,500 in debt with a nonprofit and I never met
01:51:42.40 --> 01:51:47.52 this guy before I'm a way to Wyoming the super national geographic and I got a huge fight I'm charging
01:51:47.52 --> 01:51:52.64 up my credit cards non-profit just supposed to raise money the people donate and you use that money to do good
01:51:53.20 --> 01:51:58.64 I didn't really know anything about that so I started it on profit and started putting my own money into
01:51:58.64 --> 01:52:05.84 the nonprofit and going broke I missed that page so I'll never forget this guy comes I got horses on
01:52:05.84 --> 01:52:09.68 trailer I'm heading in the Wyoming it's shoot for national geographic pack and some guys
01:52:10.32 --> 01:52:14.64 buddy calls me up oh stop and get a beer with this guy I'm like I can I'm just like a lot of
01:52:14.64 --> 01:52:19.60 problems right now and I couldn't pay for the vets to come back so I don't these vets feel as to come back
01:52:19.60 --> 01:52:23.52 and the last words I have in my wife was like I'm doing this and I'm charging up the cards and
01:52:23.52 --> 01:52:27.76 I'm gonna finish when I start out and I don't care what it costs I'll care if we sink the whole family
01:52:27.76 --> 01:52:33.60 I'm doing this I'm finishing this so on my way to Wyoming my buddy's like hey dude it's marine
01:52:33.60 --> 01:52:38.72 he's like let's get a beer with this guy and I and I refuse refuse he keeps persistently calling
01:52:38.72 --> 01:52:42.80 me so finally I stopped I could have one beer with the guy I said there I kind of talked for like
01:52:42.80 --> 01:52:47.20 I don't know 45 minutes I was like I got a gig cone he's like can I talk to you outside so
01:52:47.20 --> 01:52:52.64 I go outside he looks at me he goes he wanted to pet the one of the horses he's allergic so he puts
01:52:52.64 --> 01:52:58.16 a glove on he's out there petting it both he got it looks him he goes you're the worst nonprofit guy
01:52:58.16 --> 01:53:04.48 I've ever met my life and I've been working with charities for 40 years and I was like of course
01:53:04.48 --> 01:53:10.72 my ego's like you know far how like you know Darium but he was right I was I didn't know what I
01:53:10.72 --> 01:53:17.20 I didn't know anything and he hands me a check and he goes I want you to call me I like what you're trying to
01:53:17.20 --> 01:53:23.76 do so it gives me a check I drive down the road look at it's for 25 grand and that's what I knew I was doing the
01:53:23.76 --> 01:53:30.72 right thing and so you know I think like initially looking back I think really I was like trying to
01:53:30.72 --> 01:53:39.20 find a way to help myself you know and because I I felt so lost you know I just I felt lost I had no
01:53:39.20 --> 01:53:46.64 purpose I had no mission you know and working with horses and she went horses and just that world
01:53:46.64 --> 01:53:55.44 just took me out of where the focus was all of myself and my focus became on managing these animals
01:53:55.44 --> 01:54:00.64 and learning about them and learning and learning about myself through the animal I didn't really
01:54:00.64 --> 01:54:07.20 know that then because my my the guys that I was with were a force fear and repetition you know
01:54:07.20 --> 01:54:11.60 they were old school cowboys put me on horse has given bucked off kicked and all those things
01:54:11.60 --> 01:54:18.48 and whiskey trache and that was perfect for me at the time but you know through that relationship over
01:54:18.48 --> 01:54:24.48 the years horses became a mirror reflection to who I was you know because they're a pre-animal
01:54:25.68 --> 01:54:29.28 and they're designed to stay away from things with eyes in front of their head you know they're
01:54:29.28 --> 01:54:37.12 instinctually highly intelligent so we really very stupid of course this is not manimal and but
01:54:37.12 --> 01:54:42.96 instinctually they're highly evolved and so you know I brought these guys out I finished out the
01:54:42.96 --> 01:54:48.08 season with them I start the next season I start getting some fundraising behind me I have the first
01:54:48.08 --> 01:54:56.88 class I guy leaves the two weeks goes home to Odies and dies army officer and dies in his house Odies
01:54:56.88 --> 01:55:05.28 he was a lieutenant and so then I extended the program to realize I still have this letter I wrote
01:55:05.28 --> 01:55:11.76 the class and so I extended and today the program is now 41 days long I'll kind of skip ahead to that but
01:55:13.20 --> 01:55:19.04 what I realized is that it's actually struggle that gives everything in life value and so
01:55:19.04 --> 01:55:22.96 everything designed for veterans is designed to take the struggle away like people that wanted
01:55:22.96 --> 01:55:27.36 to help me wanted to take the struggle away when it was the re-engaging in the struggle that helped
01:55:27.36 --> 01:55:34.08 me re-establish a foundation and who I am as a person or who I was and I really just became an
01:55:34.08 --> 01:55:42.24 identity I had lost a baseline to that connection with myself and you know so many time the job
01:55:42.24 --> 01:55:46.32 is what you do but a purpose is how you live your life and so when that job went away I didn't
01:55:46.32 --> 01:55:53.92 have that purpose because I never really learned that you know that deeper connection to
01:55:55.36 --> 01:56:01.52 something that is you know I think that that's what makes us human I think that we live in
01:56:01.52 --> 01:56:06.08 sort of our minds and we live a series of ideas and we we level up through all these things and we
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:12.32 get some stuff and we get some therings and we get to some places we achieve some heights but at the
01:56:12.32 --> 01:56:19.60 end of the day when it's all said and done the real question is like what is it all for what is
01:56:19.60 --> 01:56:26.000 meaning in life and I think when those identities fade and people stop waving the flag and
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.60 nobody really cares that you're in the air force for 20 years and it's you know nobody cares
01:56:31.60 --> 01:56:36.24 that you were overseas like you kind of life kind of goes on everything spiral side of control and
01:56:36.24 --> 01:56:43.12 your the problem is always you and I think that you know now today looking at what happens over
01:56:43.12 --> 01:56:48.96 41 days it's really one long continuum conversation with yourself who am I as a person because
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:55.12 you know the average person I was reading yesterday spends between 15 and 23 years in front of the
01:56:55.12 --> 01:57:04.40 TV okay all right I started like I started like I started I was I was verifying it this morning
01:57:04.40 --> 01:57:09.92 because I was like that is the craziest thing ever because the average person lives well let's say
01:57:09.92 --> 01:57:18.000 80 80 years that's 30,000 days right so if you spend between 15 on the low end or 23 years
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:24.000 watching television right then you're not working for 24 hours right you have eight hours of sleep
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.16 every day and then you know ages one to five what are you doing you should off the floor you're
01:57:28.16 --> 01:57:31.68 putting your pans you don't know anything you came talk right here it's like wandering around
01:57:31.68 --> 01:57:36.56 people stuffing you in seats and putting your clothes on you right and then they do the same thing
01:57:36.56 --> 01:57:39.84 to you when you're old right so you got to knock off a few years at the end where they're
01:57:39.84 --> 01:57:44.96 putting weird things in you and putting diapers on you and you're kind of revert back right so how
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:54.64 much time do you really have well I was just crunching some rough math so between 37 and 38 years
01:57:54.64 --> 01:58:02.96 roughly because you spend you know what is it 419 hours on the toilet you know you spend you know
01:58:02.96 --> 01:58:07.04 a year and a half showering you know there's all these other things so that you look at
01:58:08.56 --> 01:58:15.92 I mean the question is like what is this all about you know and and what I really is is that
01:58:15.92 --> 01:58:21.76 success and failures are one and the same you can have a success and that success can be the worst
01:58:21.76 --> 01:58:25.44 thing that ever happened to you and you can have a failure and that can be the worst thing that ever
01:58:25.44 --> 01:58:31.84 happened to you because the byproducts are the same they inhibit growth and they stop evolution
01:58:31.84 --> 01:58:37.76 because you have an experience then you perpetuate that identity associated with that experience
01:58:37.76 --> 01:58:44.56 and then you live and create your future so human beings are constantly the victim of their own
01:58:44.56 --> 01:58:50.40 choices and everything is society is saying no it's not your choices it's everything else around you
01:58:50.40 --> 01:58:58.48 and so you know over 41 days I always say like I don't have any ideas for you I'm not advertising
01:58:58.48 --> 01:59:04.64 come to me and I'm gonna tell you what to do I say come here and I'll put you in a place what you're
01:59:04.64 --> 01:59:09.20 gonna learn what that is and I'm not gonna judge you for whatever the outcome is because that's
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:16.72 your life to live that's your 37 years that you have get off the TV but the state of the
01:59:16.72 --> 01:59:25.28 American veteran is absolutely in dismal condition I didn't know a lot about non-profits when
01:59:25.28 --> 01:59:30.32 I started it matter fact I didn't know anything and along the way I've met every crop
01:59:30.32 --> 01:59:37.60 wire and charlatan from here to the Rio Grande because it's it's a people make billions off the
01:59:37.60 --> 01:59:44.08 backs of other people's pain I'm sorry if you serve 10 years in the military the answer for you
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:50.000 is not too float in the tube and he don't it's like or you know to go to Texas and you know shoot
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.80 a deer that's tied to a tree in front of a corn feeder like nothing's more healing than that right like
01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.60 you know I'm sorry like and people hate me for saying that my thing is like your your own
02:00:02.40 --> 02:00:09.44 fuck you like I don't care like because I see it I see the state of these guys that show up
02:00:09.44 --> 02:00:15.20 and they are completely fractured and they've been to 15 16 institutions they're on this they've
02:00:15.20 --> 02:00:19.20 been injected with that they're on these pills they're on these psych meds are on this Medicaid they're
02:00:19.20 --> 02:00:27.52 on this and I look at them like the pandemic of suicide in the veterans community can't be
02:00:27.52 --> 02:00:31.76 understated and the numbers like I don't even know if you would ever even be able to find the
02:00:31.76 --> 02:00:39.92 real numbers really but it's substantial you know and this whole catch thing you know 22 a day like
02:00:39.92 --> 02:00:46.32 like if you're doing 22 push-ups a day for veterans suicide you're an asshole like 22 push my
02:00:46.32 --> 02:00:52.64 kick into a hundred he's eight okay like I'll be just have some dignity and then it's like you know
02:00:52.64 --> 02:00:57.92 you're on there filming like hey guys fats are killing themselves shout it to my sponsor
02:00:57.92 --> 02:01:02.96 from my new t-shirt I'm gonna be doing 22 push-ups today new lycra by the way going on my 10%
02:01:02.96 --> 02:01:10.40 use my code Bob and I mean this is the world that we're living in and I'm like we have to get back
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:19.60 into the business of developing human beings you know we have a we have a desire you know human
02:01:19.60 --> 02:01:25.52 beings are now in such a state of like hyper complexity where everything is integrated to everything
02:01:25.52 --> 02:01:31.04 is connected that there is no individualality there is no original thought you become an
02:01:31.04 --> 02:01:36.24 amalgamation of everything that you've heard and been exposed to but you really do nothing right
02:01:36.80 --> 02:01:42.88 like the jury's out like wake up do hard work learn about yourself turn the shed off like
02:01:42.88 --> 02:01:48.96 meditate like you know eat a carrot every now and then like and life is gonna be pretty good for you
02:01:48.96 --> 02:01:54.80 um doesn't mean it's gonna be easy but you'll have the built-in tools and you'll be
02:01:54.80 --> 02:02:00.96 going to learn about your higher self and you know people can say like you know oh this is like
02:02:00.96 --> 02:02:05.12 woo magic or whatever but like there is like I don't care you're in war like you got the
02:02:05.12 --> 02:02:12.32 spidey senses what is that what is that what is that thing what is meaning right what is this
02:02:12.32 --> 02:02:16.80 what is this thing meaning that we all have we all gonna answer that question at some point in
02:02:16.80 --> 02:02:21.36 our life whether you get hit by a you know a scape order like and whack your head in the curb or
02:02:21.36 --> 02:02:27.92 you die combat or you you know eat yourself to death like you're all going to face those those
02:02:27.92 --> 02:02:33.84 things and to me the heroes journey is the journey of learning about yourself and using those tools
02:02:33.84 --> 02:02:41.04 to overcome the external circumstances that you face and so like over the 41 days like we have
02:02:41.44 --> 02:02:45.84 you know that every guy walks at least 80 miles in the program just to meals
02:02:45.84 --> 02:02:51.28 they'll spend 22 days in the wilderness they won't eat a piece of sugar they won't eat dairy they
02:02:51.28 --> 02:02:58.16 won't eat they won't have juice they will only eat meat vegetable salt water and black coffee and
02:02:58.16 --> 02:03:05.36 they will learn to meditate looking to an ice tank every single day they will start today with
02:03:05.36 --> 02:03:09.52 mindfulness they'll read books they'll go through leadership courses they'll learn to shoe horses
02:03:09.52 --> 02:03:13.92 ride horses they'll learn to see themselves and working with wild moustangs they'll be put in
02:03:13.92 --> 02:03:19.36 very dangerous the situations all these are just tools to shift focus from a person that is
02:03:19.36 --> 02:03:26.72 always looking out for answers to a person that is looking in for answers and then using those answers
02:03:26.72 --> 02:03:31.52 to then change the material world around them with their choices that are authentically
02:03:31.52 --> 02:03:39.52 theirs and that's called purpose and when you start to do that years always the dragon that steps
02:03:39.52 --> 02:03:46.32 out right in front of you right the dragon steps out in front of you and and then you find out
02:03:46.32 --> 02:03:52.64 what you really want it because everything is designed today to keep you from knowing what you are like
02:03:52.64 --> 02:03:57.84 social media doesn't exist if you're not there the internet doesn't exist if you're not there
02:03:57.84 --> 02:04:06.16 you are the energy source that feeds your own demise so so you give your energy to feed your
02:04:06.16 --> 02:04:12.40 own destruction and then you complain about the very thing that you're feeding when it's always you
02:04:13.28 --> 02:04:17.20 you're the one I always tell people like oh god like the guys I did to wait or something
02:04:17.20 --> 02:04:22.72 isn't that you know whatever it's like it's like oh god he's not there if you're not there
02:04:23.36 --> 02:04:30.88 you feed it you are feeding and you are clothing and you are arming your own captors you are and
02:04:30.88 --> 02:04:39.04 everything is designed to keep you sound asleep consume consume consume consume consume yeah yeah yeah
02:04:39.04 --> 02:04:44.16 food moment let's get something you know everything is designed to fulfill these physical desires
02:04:44.88 --> 02:04:50.72 that then override you from searching from the real energy source that the people that are
02:04:50.72 --> 02:05:00.08 aware know of they know I need you to feed what I'm building you will serve serve serve
02:05:00.08 --> 02:05:09.20 as the cog you know gigantic organism and you will give your energy 40 50 years of and you
02:05:09.20 --> 02:05:18.16 get your little plaque thanks for Bob play of the month and then what you go down to self-order
02:05:18.16 --> 02:05:26.72 and you sit there and you just wait your car you're sitting in the same traffic yeah
02:05:26.72 --> 02:05:32.24 maybe it's a Ferrari so what you're in the same traffic and maybe get a little bit of better beef
02:05:33.04 --> 02:05:38.08 you know maybe this one was massage by 50 Japanese ladies or whatever right it doesn't matter
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:47.36 it doesn't matter because then the fear starts to build and then the clock just starts going
02:05:47.36 --> 02:05:52.48 in the next thing you know what are they doing they're like ah it's too late it's too late
02:05:52.48 --> 02:05:59.20 you've missed the meaning of life you've missed it and veterans are out there like perpetuating
02:05:59.20 --> 02:06:03.84 these identities that's why I don't do like you know these guys they show up and it's just like
02:06:04.96 --> 02:06:14.16 dude you got out in 2005 it's 2020 too okay they're putting chips and people's brains man
02:06:14.16 --> 02:06:24.08 no one cares about the logistics department and boggerman 05 that you know may or may not have been
02:06:24.08 --> 02:06:29.60 ordered right like like think about the numbers you would think that every veteran is burned and
02:06:29.60 --> 02:06:37.84 every veteran has been amputated 1500 amputees 0.0026% of veterans have been amputated
02:06:38.16 --> 02:06:42.32 there's billions of dollars of organizations to help they have be dated billions
02:06:42.32 --> 02:06:54.80 we got this guy a wheelchair ramp a ramp how about like a ramp made of like wood like that's like
02:06:54.80 --> 02:07:00.64 800 bucks right but but but this is what's happening we have to get back to where we start to
02:07:00.64 --> 02:07:07.44 developing ourselves push ourselves away reunite as a community and start getting serious about
02:07:07.44 --> 02:07:13.68 human development and begin giving our energy to things that matter like our food our water
02:07:13.68 --> 02:07:19.44 our shelter like the community around us doing things that are good turning off that stuff don't
02:07:19.44 --> 02:07:27.12 spend 23 years of your life in front of the TV like we have to change we have to change our minds
02:07:27.12 --> 02:07:31.84 we have to change our bodies we have to we have to become the governors of our own perceptions
02:07:32.32 --> 02:07:37.36 we're no longer the governors our own perceptions perceptions they create actions and
02:07:37.36 --> 02:07:44.08 behaviors and they're being governed by something else and you know my message is that I don't
02:07:44.08 --> 02:07:52.56 have the answers but you do and the jury's out on greatness it's it's it's spattered on walls
02:07:52.56 --> 02:08:00.72 and caves and books and tablets throughout all of mankind the jury is out no thy self
02:08:00.72 --> 02:08:07.52 know thyself there's a reason why everybody wants your energy because you're building an empire
02:08:08.08 --> 02:08:14.000 and an empire just turns out that you're it's unwitting prisoner and you can walk away
02:08:14.56 --> 02:08:21.04 and you can let yourself out and you can change you can do it we can do it and I'm not going to
02:08:21.04 --> 02:08:28.88 sit back and be a participant and watch generation like I'm nobody special I'm nobody of notoriety
02:08:28.88 --> 02:08:36.72 I'm not like all's ideal is I believe in the dignity of the human experience and there's people
02:08:36.72 --> 02:08:41.92 that I have done some really great things throughout all of the history of mankind and they did it
02:08:41.92 --> 02:08:47.20 by knowing themselves and then whatever you know we love to watch the brave hearts and we love to
02:08:47.20 --> 02:08:52.16 watch the patriots and we love to be that person be that person it's not about dying when
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:56.88 being being burned at the stake when you're 23 we'll do you spend 23's your life watching TV that's
02:08:56.88 --> 02:09:01.92 a great 23 years that a guy like William Wallace had he was able to do that because he
02:09:01.92 --> 02:09:06.72 understood it something dradano van Bruno who was burned at the stake by the Catholic Church
02:09:06.72 --> 02:09:12.64 in the 1500s for writing the Pope of vote he he looked at them when they were going to burn
02:09:12.64 --> 02:09:15.76 him at the stake and they cut his tongue out and they nailed it to over his head they were
02:09:15.76 --> 02:09:20.56 getting ready to burn him they try to get him to recount you know that the earth revolves around
02:09:20.56 --> 02:09:25.36 the sun and all these things you know that was heresy and he looked at him and he understood
02:09:25.36 --> 02:09:31.36 the deeper meaning of life and he said it's not his last words what it's not eyes who is afraid
02:09:32.16 --> 02:09:41.92 it's you and then they let the fire what a badass way to go you know so I've just dedicated my life
02:09:41.92 --> 02:09:46.96 to you know right now the program is a 41 day long program you know at the end of it we have a
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:54.48 Lakota sweat lodge I've had the opportunity to get to know some of those medicine men and you know
02:09:54.48 --> 02:10:01.52 that's an ancient tradition that is 16,000 years old that dates back and you know they say you go
02:10:01.52 --> 02:10:07.28 into the womb of the earth and when you come out you know you're reborn and it's it's really like
02:10:08.56 --> 02:10:15.12 it's like an insane sauna that has chanting and all those other kinds of things and you
02:10:15.12 --> 02:10:18.96 you're in there in the heat and you kind of go the heat brings you from the kind of physical into
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:24.16 the spiritual and so every guy will pass through those windows and they'll do a four window
02:10:24.16 --> 02:10:30.08 ceremony upon graduation and then and then people are like and then what and I'm like and then go and
02:10:30.08 --> 02:10:35.04 live your life because now you know and if you want to go participate in those same things
02:10:35.84 --> 02:10:43.76 you can do it but not ignorantly because you know you know that wow I'm creating my own experience
02:10:43.76 --> 02:10:53.28 like the the whole idea of free will I believe is what project Earth is all about it's about free will
02:10:53.28 --> 02:10:59.92 well the experiment in free will is coming to an end because everybody's been programmed everyone
02:10:59.92 --> 02:11:06.64 it's coming to an end and I'm not going to let it come to an end of my life I'm going to take power of
02:11:06.64 --> 02:11:11.60 that because free will is powerful I could get up on this table right now sell my rental car illegally
02:11:11.60 --> 02:11:17.12 to a chop shop and go climb out of Everest I could do anything anything but people do nothing
02:11:17.84 --> 02:11:22.88 they do nothing they don't understand the power that they have instead they give that unknown
02:11:22.88 --> 02:11:28.40 power away and then they blame life and they've they've become the victims of this experience we can
02:11:28.40 --> 02:11:37.44 change we can change right now people can change and in turn the goodness can be restored the goodness
02:11:37.44 --> 02:11:41.68 of this nation you know the goodness that made you sign up and say you know what I want to fight
02:11:41.68 --> 02:11:46.56 against the evil I want to stand again if I lose my limit if I get burned if I get I don't care
02:11:46.56 --> 02:11:52.88 I want to do it and and return to those values that represent not only as us as Americans but
02:11:52.88 --> 02:12:00.08 us as human beings and you know that's that's that's that's my message you know to the world
02:12:00.08 --> 02:12:08.80 is like that book right there about face wake up and turn around and do 180 degrees from what you're
02:12:08.80 --> 02:12:15.92 doing and your life will change you will change it will change and it will change for the better
02:12:15.92 --> 02:12:22.32 take that journey reject the easiness of life that is being sold because it is a poison and it is
02:12:22.32 --> 02:12:30.56 a cancer and and you will maybe you'll be rich maybe it doesn't it won't matter because you will
02:12:30.56 --> 02:12:36.48 be wealthy and heart and wealthy and mind and wealthy and spirit you know and that's uh
02:12:36.48 --> 02:12:41.36 you know that's kind of what I want to share with the world well so what's this look like first question
02:12:41.36 --> 02:12:49.84 do you need to know how to write a horse to show up no no matter fact like the majority of
02:12:49.84 --> 02:12:53.84 guys come up very you can see you know you know every even written horse before in their life
02:12:53.84 --> 02:12:58.32 had you written horses before when did you start writing horses I had one horse growing up
02:12:58.32 --> 02:13:03.76 I never I wrote it like a couple times and that was about my experience that was it
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:08.72 and then you're I'm going for this uh yes so was the introduction horses so I did not meet some
02:13:08.72 --> 02:13:14.80 uh I was uh right before I got out so this is like 2013 I ended up meeting some cowboys
02:13:14.80 --> 02:13:19.76 uh with horses in the back country and I got to know them and they invited me to the right
02:13:19.76 --> 02:13:24.16 I met him on a hiking I was just hiking with my daughter and I met him and that's how I
02:13:24.16 --> 02:13:29.28 started shooting horses so I first started shooting horses with a guy on a tip and table so they
02:13:29.28 --> 02:13:33.04 put him into a huge machine tip them on their sides and then I just my job was around like the
02:13:33.04 --> 02:13:37.84 wheel grinder and I was just like helping out and eventually I started learning how to shoot horses
02:13:37.84 --> 02:13:42.96 and start Colts and these guys like I kind of thought initially they were all about like helping
02:13:42.96 --> 02:13:47.44 vets and all this kind of stuff they were like the most like crooked human beings I've ever met
02:13:47.44 --> 02:13:54.000 in my life like real legit crooks you know because the equine business is tough like in the cowboy
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.56 world and all that kind of stuff so um but I did learn a tremendous amount those guys were
02:13:58.56 --> 02:14:04.24 mentors to me you know all that should decide and then um and then I just did these sort of
02:14:04.24 --> 02:14:09.28 ride horses all the time obviously every single day a day in and day out yeah I mean I like I said
02:14:09.28 --> 02:14:14.64 I just crossed my 18th wilderness on a horse you know so uh I we have 70 horses today
02:14:15.76 --> 02:14:20.24 I've been breaking in training while Mustangs for five years now like straight from the wild
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:24.24 and I always tell people like if you like you're like a legit tough guy like you're like
02:14:24.88 --> 02:14:29.28 I will put you in there with a completely wild horse and you're gonna find out real good
02:14:29.28 --> 02:14:35.44 how tough you are because the horse is immediately kind of sensitive you're afraid and like I had
02:14:35.44 --> 02:14:40.48 this I had this horse two years ago I never did quite get him I'll show you a cool picture of him
02:14:40.48 --> 02:14:45.68 going straight up in the air and I'm on the end of this rope um he's the only horse I ever had
02:14:45.68 --> 02:14:53.44 actually like just straight up attack me um and like attack me and what what happened was is that
02:14:53.44 --> 02:14:57.92 he would like you know you get in there and he'd start moving around and if you even take one step
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:04.48 back there one step forward okay because in the horse world you know there is uh there is a high
02:15:04.48 --> 02:15:09.44 archie you know so there's the alpha male and the alpha female and they lead the herd and then
02:15:09.44 --> 02:15:13.04 everybody else falls up's a quint land underneath so the alpha male runs it rums around looks for
02:15:13.04 --> 02:15:16.56 predators and it keeps everybody at bay and the mare's leading them to food and water in the
02:15:16.56 --> 02:15:20.80 wild the eat first they do everything first and then it slowly goes down so you're falling somewhere
02:15:20.80 --> 02:15:25.92 in the horse high archie and you know to think about horses horses the highest video two
02:15:25.92 --> 02:15:30.40 max out of any land animal on earth alright they have binocular and binocular vision they can see
02:15:30.40 --> 02:15:35.12 out of both eyes completely independently the right brain and left brain doesn't know so they're
02:15:35.12 --> 02:15:40.80 looking at something the left the right brain has no idea just like my ex-girlfriend and so
02:15:42.08 --> 02:15:47.52 but you know they uh you know when they put their heads down they can see almost 360 degrees while
02:15:47.52 --> 02:15:52.24 they're eating and but they can't see four feet front of their nose and they can't see four feet behind them
02:15:52.24 --> 02:15:58.16 um and horses does not really do one thing run so they have you know 50 liters of fluid and
02:15:58.16 --> 02:16:02.24 they're stomach and any given time which slashes around this fleet free floating intestinal
02:16:02.24 --> 02:16:07.12 system so as the horse moves that fluid slashes and slaps in the diaphragm which causes them
02:16:07.12 --> 02:16:13.68 to go to breathe in so it's boom boom so they're they're breathing in super hard and uh they
02:16:13.68 --> 02:16:16.72 can't breathe through their mouth so they breathe through their nose and their noses are
02:16:16.72 --> 02:16:23.36 flared so it's like a irram system and so horses design like you know I I can be a mile away I
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:27.44 was not Wyoming either as well horses on horseback they can feel the vibrations in the ground
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:32.32 and you just can see them on your bino they just they sense you alright so they're highly
02:16:32.32 --> 02:16:36.16 evolved at getting away from predators and now here comes human beings like hello I want to ride you
02:16:36.80 --> 02:16:43.52 and and so you have to one become their leader first so you have to have an ability of self
02:16:43.52 --> 02:16:49.36 leadership alright because they can sense that and then and then you know two you have to gain their
02:16:49.36 --> 02:16:55.92 trust and you gain that trust with that animal um by you know pressure and release so
02:16:55.92 --> 02:17:00.16 applying pressure that animal releasing that pressure and essentially talking to them you know so
02:17:00.16 --> 02:17:03.84 if you watch me working while the horses I can I'm doesn't really look like I'm doing much
02:17:03.84 --> 02:17:08.72 but I'm controlling the direction of that animal because in horse language whoever moves their
02:17:08.72 --> 02:17:13.04 feet first loses so what happens is especially with the students when they're first working with
02:17:13.04 --> 02:17:18.64 wild horses as the program progresses it's a couple days they get with wild animals you'll see the
02:17:18.64 --> 02:17:22.72 guy you know I don't know 20 year-grain were there whatever horse takes a step towards them you'll see
02:17:22.72 --> 02:17:28.000 him take a step back well that horse is like okay now you're my bit and in the next time around
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.64 he's on you right and you know horses are are like people some are you know docile some are nice
02:17:34.64 --> 02:17:40.88 some are psychotic whatever in terms of the wild ones and so yeah I had this horse and he's
02:17:40.88 --> 02:17:45.68 you know I get them like finally where I can get him saddled and everything like that it takes
02:17:45.68 --> 02:17:50.56 me like three or four days and I could get hands on I'm certainly pick this feet up and one day
02:17:50.56 --> 02:17:55.36 he just came in and he just never was a trusting horse and I kind of pushed him more than I think
02:17:55.36 --> 02:18:01.84 he was capable of at the time and I just kind of like he was just there as I'm gonna let him
02:18:01.84 --> 02:18:07.12 like soak or just let him stand there and rest and it was a pretty rough morning and and I turn
02:18:07.12 --> 02:18:12.16 around and he just like tears back and tries to strike me him back in my head you know I kind of
02:18:12.16 --> 02:18:16.24 like fall forward and then he bites me in my back you know and kind of throws me to the side of it
02:18:16.24 --> 02:18:20.48 every you know of course I'm like can't crawl up the round pen fast enough you know like I mean
02:18:21.68 --> 02:18:27.60 that's a large beast and you know so this was three or four days into you working with them
02:18:27.60 --> 02:18:33.76 yeah and he so we we adopt him completely wild I think 28 of our 70 horses are wild horses
02:18:33.76 --> 02:18:40.64 I've been been five years ago I did a film called the 500 mile project where I rode 16 wild
02:18:40.64 --> 02:18:47.04 moustangs from New Mexico to Arizona 760 miles after trading them for three months with a couple
02:18:47.04 --> 02:18:52.32 guys and it's the story of the unpurpose horse and the unpurpose human being and so here you have
02:18:52.32 --> 02:18:57.52 the wild horse which is facing the same thing as the American veteran which is huge government
02:18:57.52 --> 02:19:03.44 monies right so there's there's you know 50 100,000 whatever it is today I haven't looked wild moustangs
02:19:03.44 --> 02:19:08.32 in captivity so in 1979 they had the wild horse had burrow act so they started running them
02:19:08.32 --> 02:19:13.12 up off the ranch lands and putting them into long-term holding facilities and today it's a
02:19:13.12 --> 02:19:18.24 60 or 70 million dollar program and the problem's only worsening they've tried to shoot them
02:19:18.24 --> 02:19:23.12 at a helicopter with birth control and all these kind of things and and so the whole thing's a disaster
02:19:23.12 --> 02:19:27.12 and adoption doesn't really work either it works on a small scale but there's too many
02:19:27.12 --> 02:19:34.80 being produced to adopt them out so we go there and we adopt them we sort them out we figure
02:19:34.80 --> 02:19:38.48 them out and if you watch the film and the opening scenes of the films is very intense I mean
02:19:38.48 --> 02:19:42.88 these horses have never been around people so they're terrified because they're designed to run away
02:19:42.88 --> 02:19:48.72 from us and so you know through a series of shoots and sorting things you know we pick out what we
02:19:48.72 --> 02:19:52.80 want out of hundreds of them and then we load them into trailers and we're bringing back and then
02:19:52.80 --> 02:19:58.48 we start training them and those are the horses that then go into the program so you know horses uh
02:19:58.48 --> 02:20:03.84 is a mirror reflection to who you are because a horse is designed at sensing your predatory
02:20:03.84 --> 02:20:11.44 instincts so you may say I'm not scared or or maybe I am going to hurt you because I'm going to be
02:20:11.44 --> 02:20:16.48 very aggressive with you and then the animal becomes very afraid of you then you may not be per you know
02:20:16.48 --> 02:20:22.08 portraying that on the outside but on the inside that's what the horse is looking at you could look
02:20:22.08 --> 02:20:27.76 like you're totally calm but your heart's going 140 beats a minute and the horse feels that so
02:20:27.76 --> 02:20:31.92 then he starts thinking what are you going to do to me and then they'll test you because where you're
02:20:31.92 --> 02:20:36.96 going to be in the hierarchy and if you watch them in the pens you know there will be this one horse
02:20:36.96 --> 02:20:41.20 that will come along everybody's eating and soon as he starts walking over everybody goes away
02:20:41.20 --> 02:20:44.80 and there will be one horse that's like maybe I'm not going to go and this horse like double barrel
02:20:44.80 --> 02:20:50.40 kicks in music yeah I'm going to go so you're they don't you're somewhere on that scale
02:20:50.40 --> 02:20:55.60 and so horses a lot of the program happens in the 41 days with these horses without talking
02:20:56.16 --> 02:21:02.48 because what happens is the horse reflects back what you really are and so people blame the animal
02:21:02.48 --> 02:21:09.52 this horse is an idiot well you're an idiot now we don't say that sometimes I do
02:21:10.56 --> 02:21:16.96 but but these guys begin to realize and when they change their internal compass
02:21:16.96 --> 02:21:22.72 their relationship with their horse instantaneously change it is the most beautiful thing
02:21:23.12 --> 02:21:28.80 you see this union where all sudden okay you're my leader you're the alpha male or alpha
02:21:28.80 --> 02:21:34.64 mare and I'll kill myself for you and when a horse believes in you that might like some of my
02:21:34.64 --> 02:21:38.48 like rope horses and my really good horses like the one you go kind of like that video I said
02:21:38.48 --> 02:21:44.64 you're whatever you know they'll kill them so they will run for you until they die they will run
02:21:44.64 --> 02:21:48.24 through a fence they will they will do anything for you because they trust their leader
02:21:50.08 --> 02:21:55.28 but a lot of guys initially are just passengers on an animal that hates them because they hate
02:21:55.28 --> 02:22:01.44 themselves and they're not able to have that internal compass be calibrated so throughout that
02:22:01.44 --> 02:22:04.80 relationship and throughout the learning about horses they're really learning about themselves
02:22:04.80 --> 02:22:10.48 of the medium of the horse and so from day one you know guys apply to the program it's a really
02:22:10.48 --> 02:22:17.12 comprehensive application process and it's a hundred percent veterans all veterans yep and
02:22:17.12 --> 02:22:21.52 it's a it's a it's a tricky application you know most nonprofits you kind of like fill out the thing
02:22:21.52 --> 02:22:24.72 and it's like you know you like presence or being on it's like you're welcome like thanks
02:22:25.12 --> 02:22:30.24 like this is like gets in your head and then you know through that process you get selected
02:22:30.24 --> 02:22:34.08 you know kind of rate guys one to five you know we can only take so many guys you know we get a couple
02:22:34.08 --> 02:22:39.52 hundred applications a year and then and then we send them two books communicate with them every week
02:22:39.52 --> 02:22:43.60 help them lose weight change your diet we send them articles on testosterone suppression
02:22:43.60 --> 02:22:48.56 through SSRIs and medications and all these kind of unhealthy lifestyle we help them kind of
02:22:48.56 --> 02:22:55.12 level up as they're preparing and then when they arrive it's you know kind of indoctrination
02:22:55.12 --> 02:22:59.12 getting the ice tanks this is how this works this is our morning routine so you wake up it's a
02:22:59.12 --> 02:23:05.60 mile walk in the dark off the ranch they walk down to the main area the you know mobility work
02:23:05.60 --> 02:23:09.20 with Jim Jones so they designed our workout program all based you know these guys are not trying
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:12.64 to get jacked or anything but they some of them are like straight off the mission of the kitchen so
02:23:13.28 --> 02:23:17.60 you know they they like I mean we have guys that like haven't why did a guy last year that said
02:23:17.60 --> 02:23:22.32 he had walked up a flight stairs in seven years all right so now like you're entering into like
02:23:22.96 --> 02:23:30.16 you want I mean pain when you're scoping out applicants are you trying to create a what
02:23:30.16 --> 02:23:34.72 you call it a class yeah so I create a class but I are you trying to create a class of like
02:23:35.84 --> 02:23:40.08 do you look at the people go look this guy's probably he's gonna need some help but he's probably
02:23:40.08 --> 02:23:45.04 gonna do well this other person's like like this is a train wreck over here or he just looking
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:49.84 for train wrecks I just take the worst of the worst guy so you're looking for and I put them all together
02:23:49.84 --> 02:23:54.16 and there's no signs to that because to me it's like you to get through this you have to work as a
02:23:54.16 --> 02:23:59.04 team but it's about the individual you're on your own journey and you're gonna need other people
02:23:59.04 --> 02:24:03.84 to help you along the way but I don't care if they ever talked to those guys again a lot of
02:24:03.84 --> 02:24:08.72 amainting some of the closest friendships ever a matter of fact on the way here some guys a
02:24:10.64 --> 02:24:14.16 Canadian special operations sent me a guy and last year and he
02:24:16.24 --> 02:24:24.16 changes life this guy was in a real bad way and they've made team relationships with each other but
02:24:24.16 --> 02:24:28.80 ultimately it's about the individual because they're on the heroes journey and the heroes journey
02:24:28.80 --> 02:24:32.96 is that you have to walk through those flames you have to go through those fires you have to
02:24:32.96 --> 02:24:39.52 feel it and so you know 430 in the morning they wake up they walk a mile down to the main camp
02:24:39.52 --> 02:24:46.000 then they intentionally move their bodies they get done with that we do a meditation and then
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.08 they do breath work the Wim Hof breath holding and then they get into a nice tank and then that
02:24:50.08 --> 02:24:57.04 scales up to you know they're sitting there for like 10 minutes and that's pretty rough on guys
02:24:57.04 --> 02:25:02.08 that are like straight off like and then and then it's all about horses and so then in the evening
02:25:02.08 --> 02:25:08.000 we have what we call the the Maxim Lab which is a leadership course based on stoism so I don't tell
02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:12.16 them any ideas while presenting a question what does it mean you know choose to be harmed
02:25:12.16 --> 02:25:16.72 in your harm choose not to be harmed and you haven't been what does that mean and guys will go around
02:25:16.72 --> 02:25:21.68 and let them talk things out and so throughout the program they'll do that for 40 days and then
02:25:21.68 --> 02:25:26.48 after after six days they'll head into the back country for eight days they are given a horse
02:25:26.48 --> 02:25:30.32 and a mule so it's weight six days they've been there yep they've been doing this routine
02:25:30.32 --> 02:25:35.12 they've been learning about horses well at this point everybody can load the horse
02:25:35.12 --> 02:25:40.72 and go down and run everybody can you know rain control their horse and pack a mule
02:25:40.72 --> 02:25:45.60 and understands equine medicine, trucks, trailers all that kind of stuff they get all that in
02:25:45.60 --> 02:25:50.08 six days so it's very intensive those are some long days extremely long days
02:25:50.08 --> 02:25:56.72 um matter of fact like there was like a guy with a vet came out and he's like um like
02:25:56.72 --> 02:26:02.72 there's like guys sleeping like right next to the horse like I know I look you guys come on
02:26:02.72 --> 02:26:10.000 we're not in the military now we understand up and like but but so six days of
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.60 so the beginning of the program they're there they're getting all this good stuff that you're
02:26:13.60 --> 02:26:19.76 given and they're only eating like meat vegetables what do you say salt water and coffee
02:26:19.76 --> 02:26:24.88 that's it okay there's no juice there's no dairy there's no honey nothing you know and and then
02:26:24.88 --> 02:26:29.60 after six days of that then it's we're going in the wilderness yeah all the horse back
02:26:29.60 --> 02:26:34.000 with the horse you on your horse and your mule correct as a team as a team some of these
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.80 guys are most they're paired together eight guys in the class are paired together and they
02:26:36.80 --> 02:26:39.92 got to pack their own stuff and then of course there's camp gear and all that stuff we have
02:26:39.92 --> 02:26:44.32 duties and all lined up for everybody and that's a progressive trip so there is no main camp
02:26:44.32 --> 02:26:49.60 so everyday they pack up and move so you know all ultra light stuff you know most of
02:26:49.60 --> 02:26:54.72 time I never use a 10 I'm just I just sleep out and let's say rains and they'll spend eight
02:26:54.72 --> 02:26:59.44 days we'll do like around eight or 90 miles on that trip then they'll come back and they'll start
02:26:59.44 --> 02:27:02.72 the next morning what's called ranch week so now they're going to learn how to rope they're
02:27:02.72 --> 02:27:06.32 going to we have you know cows they're going to learn how to rope cows how to do stock management
02:27:06.32 --> 02:27:10.64 they're going to learn more advanced riding they're going to learn how to work on a ranch how to
02:27:10.64 --> 02:27:15.20 be in working ranch and so that's called ranch week it's all about ranch stuff they'll drive
02:27:15.20 --> 02:27:19.28 tractors and they'll learn all these things in different groups throughout you know the whole facility
02:27:19.28 --> 02:27:23.12 then a lot of times we'll move we'll go to another ranch we'll help them gather and sort and
02:27:23.12 --> 02:27:27.12 ship cows and do stuff depending on what's going on so that's ranch week and then they start you know
02:27:27.12 --> 02:27:32.32 I guess you could say like phase two or something where there are another six days of training so
02:27:32.32 --> 02:27:37.04 that training is blacksmithing so they'll learn how to shoe over so they'll learn how to trim
02:27:37.04 --> 02:27:40.80 learn how to pair and learn equine medicine they'll work with wild moustangs they'll do cult
02:27:40.80 --> 02:27:45.60 starting they'll do raining they'll do more advanced riding they'll do roping well actually
02:27:45.60 --> 02:27:50.08 rope live cows and they'll learn how to you know how to manage them how to operate on a working
02:27:50.08 --> 02:27:54.80 ranch in terms of all the agricultural components and they'll learn more packing and they'll
02:27:54.80 --> 02:27:58.24 learn how to put we know seven eight ten animals out of time pull them together how to drive
02:27:58.24 --> 02:28:02.32 trucks how to drive trailers how to do chains how to run chainsaw how to run axe it all those
02:28:02.32 --> 02:28:07.76 kind of things and then then they'll head into the backcountry for eleven days and then that's
02:28:07.76 --> 02:28:14.16 it's how many days deeper we into this program right now like is the eleven days or something
02:28:14.16 --> 02:28:18.32 so is the eleven days sort of like the final days in the field yeah and that's a tough trip like
02:28:18.32 --> 02:28:23.44 it's tough on me it's tough like you know eleven or twelve days in the wilderness like that
02:28:23.44 --> 02:28:29.20 progressively moving wears on you plus the animals have their own personalities and there's
02:28:29.20 --> 02:28:34.08 you know we run our stock loose so we tie you know we hobble them and we turn them loose in the
02:28:34.08 --> 02:28:38.72 mountains and so you know you gotta get up and you gotta gather in the morning it's cold snowing
02:28:38.72 --> 02:28:42.48 in August you know all those kind of challenges last year we rode across the wind rivers
02:28:42.48 --> 02:28:48.56 or either 120 miles across one river range and that was brutal trip it was incredible but it's just
02:28:48.56 --> 02:28:51.84 tough and then you know you're chewing horses you're constantly where you build and camp you're
02:28:51.84 --> 02:28:57.52 cooking everything and it's all this you know like whole food stuff so guys are it's a tough trip
02:28:57.52 --> 02:29:01.92 and then they lead every day so every day a different guy leads he has the map he has the
02:29:01.92 --> 02:29:05.92 routes he makes all the decisions I let him fail I let him fall flat on their face I let him make
02:29:05.92 --> 02:29:10.88 mistakes as long as nobody's gonna get hurt let him feel that take you know ownership of all those
02:29:10.88 --> 02:29:16.80 kind of you know that leadership component and confidence and stuff and so and then they get back
02:29:16.80 --> 02:29:21.52 and then when they get back from that trip obviously everyone's decimated so the average guy last year
02:29:21.52 --> 02:29:30.88 lost 20 pounds in the program her record that last year was 37 pounds in 41 days and yeah and
02:29:30.88 --> 02:29:37.28 then and then the med countless 11 psych meds guy I walked away from so and then of course you
02:29:37.28 --> 02:29:42.32 have the guys on the ones season the doos season stuff like that so they get back then we wake them up
02:29:42.32 --> 02:29:46.32 at one o'clock in the morning they usually get the bed around 10 that night after we because you know
02:29:46.32 --> 02:29:50.08 horses come first so you got a doctor horses clean horses you got to do shoes you got to do
02:29:50.08 --> 02:29:53.76 all those things and then we'll wake them up driving them to a mountain make them climb
02:29:53.76 --> 02:29:59.20 saccharidrea peaks with 10,000 foot peak in the dark because the metaphor is that nobody really
02:29:59.20 --> 02:30:04.40 cares what you just accomplished because behind every mountain is another mountain and so we
02:30:04.40 --> 02:30:08.32 want them to feel that and in that video you can see the guy standing on that peak and then one
02:30:08.32 --> 02:30:12.80 guy's gonna rub in the other guy in the back you know none of that's acting or anything and I was
02:30:12.80 --> 02:30:18.48 a real emotional moment because they have lived a lifetime and it is real life it's not like you're
02:30:18.48 --> 02:30:22.64 coming here and this is fake life and I'm gonna leave and go back to real life it's all real life
02:30:22.64 --> 02:30:28.16 there is no fake life right it's all real right you put the virtual reality goggles on for nine
02:30:28.16 --> 02:30:35.04 hours that's real life right it does not time doesn't stop and so um the climb that mountain they
02:30:35.04 --> 02:30:39.92 come down pack up all their gear in the next day is graduation day so then they get into the sweat
02:30:39.92 --> 02:30:46.08 lodge so they graduate getting into the sweat lodge they go through that we do some sound stuff with them
02:30:46.08 --> 02:30:51.52 and then we have a year long take home course called stay the course or the guys I've died
02:30:51.52 --> 02:30:58.72 reading suggested reading you know fitness stuff access to an app and kind of like you know
02:30:58.72 --> 02:31:04.16 whole food eating and stuff like that and then the guys that want to we plug them into an
02:31:04.16 --> 02:31:08.16 internship and then they go for four to six weeks to Alaska why don't we Montana you
02:31:08.16 --> 02:31:12.000 totally go to work in ranches they go to cowboy outfits they go to outfiters and you know
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:21.92 and you come and at this point in their wife when they're done they've moved on and had an
02:31:21.92 --> 02:31:27.92 interesting guy this year who gave straight out of the marine corps basically like weeks and came
02:31:27.92 --> 02:31:33.52 here and he showed up and he was like straight up like rager Rick you know yeah they're like the
02:31:33.52 --> 02:31:38.80 oakley's on you know yeah the like you were like he straight everything was the military everything
02:31:38.80 --> 02:31:48.40 was the military when he left he had left all his military clothes in my garbage bag had you know
02:31:48.40 --> 02:31:54.40 cowboy hats like the whole thing and had essentially he's been worked on his Mexican I got him
02:31:54.40 --> 02:32:01.84 I happened to know a team guy buddy of mine awesome guy and who works for a guy that has a ranch in
02:32:01.84 --> 02:32:07.28 Mexico so he's been ranching in Mexico like his whole life is like completely different I think
02:32:07.28 --> 02:32:13.92 what would happen if more people got out and immediately took on the next challenge in their life
02:32:13.92 --> 02:32:19.52 in the face of everything and where would they be today and you know that's my overarching goal is that
02:32:19.52 --> 02:32:24.56 like you know the sweat lodge is a super powerful thing and it can be terrifying how hot is this
02:32:24.56 --> 02:32:34.96 sweatlock and really hot like like really hotter than normal sauna hot oh yeah so so the rocks
02:32:34.96 --> 02:32:39.44 that they use they go out and gather the rocks there lava rocks they haven't been heated up since the
02:32:39.44 --> 02:32:47.36 last you know younger dry has impact they're our last major volcanic eruptions and you know
02:32:47.36 --> 02:32:53.36 they put them in there and there's a lot of drumming and songs they honor everything the water and
02:32:53.36 --> 02:32:58.80 earth and all those things and it's called the Anipi will come which is one of like seven sacred
02:32:58.80 --> 02:33:06.72 ceremonies so like the sun dance which is hanging by your flesh from a pole for three days with no
02:33:06.72 --> 02:33:14.24 food or water and then to come off that they hook buffalo skulls to you and you have to run into
02:33:14.24 --> 02:33:20.96 the desert until they rip out of your back these guys have all done this numerous times and then there's
02:33:20.96 --> 02:33:28.16 the you see these guys you're talking about the look guys yeah yeah yeah and they there are
02:33:28.16 --> 02:33:32.24 some of the there's some of the deepest most special people that I've ever met they are people
02:33:32.24 --> 02:33:36.56 that when you meet them you know like these people are good they're like good peat like there's a
02:33:36.56 --> 02:33:45.68 wholeness to them that is attractive like there is a balance to them and so these guys of course
02:33:45.68 --> 02:33:50.40 are terrified you know everybody's like you go into this little tiny lodge and you're in there you
02:33:50.40 --> 02:33:56.08 can't see your hand in front of your face and the heat begins to increase in the songs and they
02:33:56.08 --> 02:34:00.64 you know they welcome in you know all kinds of different things in animal spirits all that kind
02:34:00.64 --> 02:34:05.20 of stuff and when you come out how long are you in there for well the door open closes four
02:34:05.20 --> 02:34:10.80 times with the whole things like a couple hours and so then there's the then there's the vision
02:34:10.80 --> 02:34:17.60 quest where you go in there for 24 hours with no food or water alone that's and then there's the
02:34:17.60 --> 02:34:21.60 four days we've had people on our ranch that grown up there for four days with no food and
02:34:21.60 --> 02:34:28.32 water by themselves in the mountain and they sit up there in the sweat lodge no that's one of the other
02:34:28.32 --> 02:34:34.64 rights so the sweat lodge was banned in North American until 1976 it was illegal
02:34:35.68 --> 02:34:40.64 matter fact dancing was illegal native American dancing was illegal so when Columbus arrived in
02:34:40.64 --> 02:34:45.28 the North American continent there was 60 million natives here at the start of World War One there was
02:34:45.28 --> 02:34:54.32 800 thousand left in Buffalo almost 60 million had been killed to what's to extinction so those rights were banned
02:34:54.32 --> 02:34:59.60 and it was illegal matter fact it was illegal to carry those names let's sort of like on a reservation
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:05.12 so there's a real tradition and history you know you're not taking psychedelics or anything that's
02:35:05.12 --> 02:35:12.000 it's the heat and and it's the prayers and it does change you and it leaves an impact in the first time
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.000 I ever did it I'll tell you right now I was ready to dig my way out of there like I did not like it
02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.88 because your mind's like of course I started watching YouTube videos you know I'm like oh no
02:35:22.88 --> 02:35:28.88 like I get it I was like I'm in a die I can't get out of like STV like no and I'm back in the
02:35:28.88 --> 02:35:36.08 black tube of death and and I it's had such an impact and I've done eight of them now and
02:35:36.08 --> 02:35:44.48 you know I've really like learned I guess like in a way to honor myself like in a way that is
02:35:44.48 --> 02:35:50.24 you know my mind my body my spirit by like what I eat and and how who I am in relationship with
02:35:50.24 --> 02:35:56.40 who I expose my life to my energy to like what I put my intentions towards like all these things
02:35:56.40 --> 02:36:03.44 begin to kind of open up to you as the weeks and of your life go on and so it's something that we've
02:36:03.44 --> 02:36:08.32 integrated into the program that's been really effective and deep do you hallucinate
02:36:09.12 --> 02:36:14.88 is that what you're talking about? So like I had an interesting I guess you could say not every time
02:36:14.88 --> 02:36:19.52 is been different not one has been the same some have been like incredible other ones I feel like
02:36:19.52 --> 02:36:26.000 I just suffered like they're all different but I actually had really interesting thing is that like
02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:34.80 I was in there and I saw a baby in the womb up here over the fire and but there's no fire.
02:36:34.80 --> 02:36:39.28 That's a hallucination I think. Well I think I'm not sure though.
02:36:41.28 --> 02:36:46.16 There's no fire the rocks are just red but you can't really see them then they're in this hole
02:36:47.12 --> 02:36:52.16 so there's no fire it's a hot rocks and they keep and then people open the door and bring them in and
02:36:52.16 --> 02:36:56.48 put them in there and then they have buffalo horns and they add the water to the keep dumping water
02:36:56.48 --> 02:37:01.04 on it with buffalo horns and they're singing drums and chanting and all and stuff and I saw like
02:37:01.04 --> 02:37:07.68 a baby in the womb like in a fetus and it appeared over the fire and I thought like oh man like
02:37:09.68 --> 02:37:15.20 like the children like are dying or so I don't know I had this like thing and then like a week later
02:37:15.20 --> 02:37:22.88 my wife found out she was pregnant and then I and Centaneously knew like that's what I saw
02:37:22.88 --> 02:37:27.60 and knew that I would have another child and I don't believe that children come from me I think
02:37:27.60 --> 02:37:32.40 they've passed through you and you know I think they're here for particular times I think we can
02:37:32.40 --> 02:37:38.72 become derail that's human beings because we you know we get enticed you know by gross materialism
02:37:38.72 --> 02:37:43.12 and all these things that detractors for ourselves and then somebody else has got to come along
02:37:43.12 --> 02:37:49.52 but yeah so so that experience has been powerful so I added it to the program and people I was like so
02:37:49.52 --> 02:37:54.40 what book did you read? who did you do? like what did you? I'm like nothing zero it's just my own journey
02:37:54.40 --> 02:38:01.04 it's all the things that I've done in my life that have helped me really become united with myself
02:38:01.04 --> 02:38:05.76 I had become homesick from whom I was as a person rather it was the wild and crazy
02:38:05.76 --> 02:38:10.56 religious stuff of the day where you know casting the dean is or whatever or it was the military
02:38:10.56 --> 02:38:16.32 or it was the agency or it was all these other experiences you know I had lost a footing
02:38:17.92 --> 02:38:22.72 and a connection to myself and now that that connection and that link has been restored
02:38:24.24 --> 02:38:31.12 you know I feel a balance that I've never felt before my life I you know I always tell people
02:38:31.12 --> 02:38:38.24 like I don't have a retirement I don't have any 401k I tell my kids I'm not paying for your college
02:38:38.24 --> 02:38:44.000 and I'm not buying you a car like I'm not doing any of those things but I will build an ecosystem
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.48 here and teach you how to hunt and how to work the land and how to honor the animals and do all those
02:38:48.48 --> 02:38:54.64 things and I will support you but you're gonna have to do it yourself and yeah I'm not gonna
02:38:54.64 --> 02:38:59.52 if I go tomorrow they're like you got cancer I'm like okay I'm going to like Bob Marley like I'm
02:38:59.52 --> 02:39:04.000 just gonna be like alright cool and not poking me and sticking me and doing anything I'll just like
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:13.68 I'm not you know so these experiences have given me a connection to a place where you find true peace
02:39:14.16 --> 02:39:19.44 it doesn't mean the world around you is peaceful but and it doesn't mean you're weak and you're
02:39:19.44 --> 02:39:24.80 some kind of like you know snowflake or whatever it's a it's a balance that you when you read
02:39:24.80 --> 02:39:30.16 about the great wars the the the sun zoos and you read the towel jeans and you read about the
02:39:30.16 --> 02:39:35.12 Alexander the Greats and you read about the people that you list season all these great people there was
02:39:35.12 --> 02:39:40.40 a balance they had they were artists they were calligraphers they were also kill you in 57 different ways
02:39:40.96 --> 02:39:47.76 but not out of anger and not out of hate and there were such a place of balance and so you know my life
02:39:47.76 --> 02:39:53.36 now is about restoring that balance and then bringing that balance to other people but I can't do it for you
02:39:53.36 --> 02:40:01.52 and over the course of 41 days you know it is a it is a is a conversation how much do you do
02:40:01.52 --> 02:40:07.76 really want it more often than not we fall in love with getting in shape you know we fall in love
02:40:07.76 --> 02:40:13.36 with being healthy or we fall in love with you know having things or whatever but we don't like the
02:40:13.36 --> 02:40:19.20 idea of what it takes to get there you know we don't like that we we don't like to feel uncomfortable
02:40:19.20 --> 02:40:24.16 and and we have to become comfortable and the uncomfortable and in turn the things that are
02:40:24.16 --> 02:40:29.60 holding you back they they dissipate and go away you know so that's what the 41 days is about
02:40:30.32 --> 02:40:35.12 yeah you know you and I didn't talk before you showed up here today and and so when like I was
02:40:35.12 --> 02:40:41.76 putting together your words and I'm glad you've hit this a couple times today and I wasn't 100
02:40:41.76 --> 02:40:50.32 percent sure but certainly I was pretty confident that idea that you are introducing situations
02:40:50.32 --> 02:40:55.92 to people that then they figure out like what the answers are to their questions and then you said
02:40:55.92 --> 02:41:00.16 it multiple times today like hey I don't have the answer for you and I can't tell you what to do here
02:41:00.16 --> 02:41:04.96 what to do there but I can take you to a place where you're going to start looking into
02:41:04.96 --> 02:41:10.56 you're going to start looking inside and you're going to start asking some questions and finding the
02:41:10.56 --> 02:41:16.48 answers yeah it's exactly not that's everybody is trying to tell you how to be you know like you
02:41:16.48 --> 02:41:20.16 go to Tony Robyn I don't want to disown your Robinson and then because he's like probably
02:41:20.16 --> 02:41:28.000 it'll send us assets ever. I'm like good luck to those assets for you for you I dare you
02:41:28.88 --> 02:41:32.32 but yeah like they're going to track you up in the mountains on four sides of the
02:41:32.32 --> 02:41:42.000 southern you get me Tony Robyn coming in there you're like dare you a challenge you Tony I saw show how
02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.000 they get so amped up and they spend their life watching all this stuff and all these things
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.96 and going to these things but they don't actually do anything if you did one tenth of the
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:55.60 information that's contained in your brain you wouldn't be in a situation you're in we just
02:41:55.60 --> 02:42:00.64 become addicted to getting more information you know it's like you know 12 steps to purpose like
02:42:00.64 --> 02:42:05.92 oh man like you're going to get to the end and 12 is like woo but then was a guy come out with
02:42:05.92 --> 02:42:10.24 nine steps like oh shit I got to get the other book there's only nine like you know like now
02:42:10.24 --> 02:42:17.12 with he he's got he's got nine more books to write uh to me the jury is out on what it means
02:42:17.12 --> 02:42:25.52 to really be a human but we've lost that we've lost that knowledge um in pursuit of a construct
02:42:25.52 --> 02:42:30.24 that if I if I get to the end of an idea that never was mine in my first place all achieve
02:42:30.24 --> 02:42:38.000 some end state right all retire or all achieve happiness you know maybe it's a it used to be in the
02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.04 80s you know become a millionaire now if you're a millionaire who gives a shit a million bucks like I
02:42:43.04 --> 02:42:48.16 mean it's like a million bucks is like nothing nowadays right you know it's it's what was it like
02:42:48.16 --> 02:42:52.24 they're had that spending bill or whatever it's like if you took one trillion dollars you stack
02:42:52.24 --> 02:42:58.24 that on end and go a third of the way to the moon okay so 3.5 trillion goes to the moon in part of
02:42:58.24 --> 02:43:05.44 the way back right like so but there are those things like that really matter in life are
02:43:06.40 --> 02:43:13.84 are your food your water your shelter in your relationships in your life and um if you're not in balance
02:43:13.84 --> 02:43:19.68 with those things there's nothing there's no things in life that are gonna help you find a place of
02:43:19.68 --> 02:43:26.80 completion because eventually you will face the man in the mirror you will eventually no matter what
02:43:26.80 --> 02:43:31.04 you know matter how many cart no matter what it is like I was using example of like warm
02:43:31.04 --> 02:43:35.36 buff it was like laying in the desert and dying like about to die and I came like walking by
02:43:35.92 --> 02:43:43.12 with some water and I was like hey weren't get me all the money that you have
02:43:44.56 --> 02:43:49.84 and I'll give you this water you would take it he would 100% take it he wouldn't be like
02:43:49.84 --> 02:43:57.36 oh no he'd be like like he'd want it right so it puts everything in relative perspective and the
02:43:57.36 --> 02:44:02.40 most exciting adventure you can go on is the adventure with yourself that is the most exciting
02:44:02.40 --> 02:44:08.64 adventure and then your whole life opens up we spend our time like in shitty relationships with
02:44:08.64 --> 02:44:14.40 shitty people afraid to change and jobs that we hate doing things that we don't want to do
02:44:14.40 --> 02:44:19.28 to get to places that we never wanted to go in the first place and then we play and then they
02:44:19.28 --> 02:44:27.52 when I was using this yeah I'm like okay if you're depressed okay and everyone's like you know
02:44:27.52 --> 02:44:32.80 this for a while was like the mental health month and the mental health stuff was going on like crazy
02:44:32.80 --> 02:44:38.000 like you know everyone's like hey guys mental health month you know skydiving for mental health like
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:46.72 I'm conducting a boxing clinic for mental health and bringing awareness to it and mental health
02:44:46.72 --> 02:44:50.80 so then you're like I'm depressed and it's like okay I'm depressed so then you go to the person
02:44:50.80 --> 02:44:56.80 that's in charge of the construct and they say what's a matter you don't like your life well
02:44:56.80 --> 02:45:02.000 I don't know something's wrong like hmm well we're gonna give you some things to get you back to work
02:45:02.64 --> 02:45:07.92 okay we're gonna get you back in love with the very thing that you hate it's never something is wrong
02:45:07.92 --> 02:45:14.000 with the thing the construct itself it's always something wrong with you so then you're like okay
02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.92 so you take this stuff and you feel good for a while and you're like butterflies and everything's
02:45:17.92 --> 02:45:23.92 going around with it and it wears off in six months and you go back and then the people tell you okay
02:45:23.92 --> 02:45:27.68 we gotta get you back in love we gotta get you back to work we gotta get you back on depressed
02:45:27.68 --> 02:45:33.84 it's never about making massive lifestyle changes like it's never about throwing the keys away
02:45:34.48 --> 02:45:39.60 getting radically committed to yourself it's always about changing you to get you back in love
02:45:39.60 --> 02:45:46.16 with the very thing that's causing the depression right it's never about like radical change it's
02:45:46.16 --> 02:45:49.84 always like hmm you have a chemical amounts so we'll give you some chemicals to get you back in
02:45:49.84 --> 02:45:58.08 balance that'll work by the way 79 bucks a month and and so I think that like we have to stop
02:45:58.80 --> 02:46:05.12 like we have to pump the brakes like you know we have to return back to the basics of what it
02:46:05.12 --> 02:46:10.48 means to be a human and you know my work with veterans is like they're basically involved in a social
02:46:10.48 --> 02:46:18.16 system right they show up to an institution it's a one size fits all right my greater goal is to create
02:46:18.16 --> 02:46:26.24 a board of the smart innovators people that that maybe there's a wellness arm like a FedEx for
02:46:26.24 --> 02:46:31.28 veterans right in the post office doesn't work where guys can say you know what red pill blue pill
02:46:31.28 --> 02:46:37.68 hmm six weeks in therapy meds this that counseling for ten years all these other things institutions
02:46:37.68 --> 02:46:42.000 meanings or whatever or maybe there's an eight week program I'm gonna go to that'll be the
02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:48.08 suckiest thing I've ever done in my life it'll be the true heroes journey but when I come out the
02:46:48.08 --> 02:46:54.40 other side I will have learned what I am and I will take that knowledge and I will begin to change
02:46:54.40 --> 02:47:02.40 the world around me with my own energy my own impetus and my own identity from the inside out we should
02:47:02.40 --> 02:47:07.76 give people that opportunity but instead you know you show up to these like you said these false
02:47:07.76 --> 02:47:14.80 profits that what are they there really really to do yeah what's scary about this is
02:47:14.80 --> 02:47:25.12 so much of the stuff that that people get like prescribed or advised it actually you know in
02:47:25.12 --> 02:47:30.40 some of the talks that you talk about like peeling away layers to get to you all those other
02:47:30.40 --> 02:47:35.68 things are actually added layers they're adding layers on top of layers on top of layers
02:47:36.40 --> 02:47:42.24 that seem to smooth things over for a month or you know three months or whatever and then all
02:47:42.24 --> 02:47:49.76 the sudden that whatever's in there is starting to burn through and cause you know costic material
02:47:49.76 --> 02:47:53.76 to rise the surface and so you're like wait a second I don't know if this is it so you go back
02:47:53.76 --> 02:47:58.80 and they say cool oh oh you got a little friction coming out little costic materials coming out
02:47:58.80 --> 02:48:03.04 cool let's put another layer on that and put another layer on that and then we you know what are you
02:48:03.04 --> 02:48:09.20 going to put over yourself you're going to put you know a car or a watch or whatever expensive item
02:48:09.20 --> 02:48:19.28 that is another layer on top of this it it's not a solution no it's not it's not it's not it's like
02:48:19.28 --> 02:48:25.60 this is set I so I just went through yesterday with my wife we like threw out like a shit ton of
02:48:25.60 --> 02:48:33.04 stuff right because the average American household has over 300,000 items in it and I walked in there
02:48:33.04 --> 02:48:40.000 you have a weird like a nerdy freaking what a statistical analytical mind well I like it I actually
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.32 just watched like a big when I was traveling back from Florida about these like minimalist people or
02:48:44.32 --> 02:48:48.40 whatever and they you know of course went in there and it's like I told my wife so we were
02:48:48.40 --> 02:48:52.40 down in Florida and what does she want to do she's like obsessed with a good will we don't buy anything new
02:48:52.40 --> 02:48:57.52 but nothing and my kids nothing new zero everything we buy used or you know could build whatever
02:48:57.52 --> 02:49:03.44 but that in and of itself is an addiction right because I'm like she's like oh my gosh I got this
02:49:03.44 --> 02:49:08.56 flan on like you have like 90 flan on I should kind of know what this one was like three bucks and I'm like
02:49:09.20 --> 02:49:14.32 that's the problem right like you don't need that right so so we went we were like okay
02:49:15.04 --> 02:49:19.84 once a week we're in a target one portion of the house and get rid of stuff so yesterday we threw
02:49:19.84 --> 02:49:26.72 a wee we're taking to the good well we I mean I don't we took out an entire like four to expedition
02:49:26.72 --> 02:49:32.24 full of things okay and then like we were done I like three o'clock after noon and I looked around
02:49:32.24 --> 02:49:38.08 and I was like it doesn't even look like we took anything out I mean like how many potato pillars
02:49:38.08 --> 02:49:43.92 did we have I was like we had like nine potato pillars meanwhile and Ethiopia I'm like
02:49:44.48 --> 02:49:50.56 I'm like we had so many things and what do things represent their measurements of time
02:49:50.56 --> 02:49:57.60 their measurements of time because you have to have time expanded and energy to get that thing
02:49:58.24 --> 02:50:03.44 right and so and then I get this thing and then there's always another thing that you need to get
02:50:03.44 --> 02:50:08.08 wow the attachment for the mixture that goes in the thing that does the pasta like oh I'm doing that
02:50:08.08 --> 02:50:13.76 should have like well it's an action tag you know we'll have to add it on there and so we started going
02:50:13.76 --> 02:50:18.88 through and just getting rid of tons of stuff you know and and the scariest thing is going to be
02:50:18.88 --> 02:50:25.12 like going to my closet you know like and and realizing that wow I've spent a lot of time in my life
02:50:25.12 --> 02:50:30.48 getting these things and I'm like never have time I had a time and I'm enough time what am I doing
02:50:30.48 --> 02:50:35.44 with my time I'm using my time to get things that I don't need and so it's like Gandhi was
02:50:35.44 --> 02:50:40.72 asked the question what confuses him most about modern man he said modern man spends all his time
02:50:40.72 --> 02:50:46.96 to get money then spends all his money to get this time back that's I mean that's pretty profound
02:50:46.96 --> 02:50:52.72 right like and I remember I'm not calculous I was like a young well not not a young seal but
02:50:52.72 --> 02:50:58.24 I'd been in the team for a while and there was people I guess as sort of maybe
02:50:58.24 --> 02:51:03.52 remember the adventure racing things is that started coming out and but then that became sort of
02:51:03.52 --> 02:51:10.72 extreme sport and like that whole thing and then I thought to myself man people like work hard
02:51:10.72 --> 02:51:16.000 to get money to pay for to learn how to skydive or scuba diving I get to do that best is freaking cool
02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:20.80 like I had the whole system beat man but God did it a little bit you know it's like a man
02:51:20.80 --> 02:51:24.40 I'll do it you're working your ass off to go to this I'm literally getting paid to do that stuff
02:51:24.40 --> 02:51:35.36 in the first place I want one thing that I that I think was probably it might be it's a very important
02:51:35.36 --> 02:51:41.36 part of my life when I was in the teams I my first platoon and I like figured out to take a
02:51:41.36 --> 02:51:46.80 step back and look around I call it detachment now because I don't know that's the word that
02:51:46.80 --> 02:51:52.64 I figured out to call it but like you're in a situation there's shit going on and no no one's
02:51:52.64 --> 02:51:57.28 making a decision and I like learn hey take a step back look around and you'll be able to see
02:51:57.28 --> 02:52:03.76 infinitely more than if you keep staring down the sights of your weapon or whatever I learned that
02:52:03.76 --> 02:52:08.64 clearing oil rigs and training and then I started applying it and everything I did but then at
02:52:08.64 --> 02:52:12.96 some point I started applying it to like you know having a conversation with my platoon chief and my
02:52:12.96 --> 02:52:17.28 platoon chief starts getting mad about something I'm thinking instead of me being in the moment like
02:52:17.28 --> 02:52:22.32 in my own head getting mad back and escalating the situation and now I'm just yelling
02:52:22.32 --> 02:52:26.64 match with my platoon chief I never never never did that I'd be like oh god it chief and I would take a
02:52:26.64 --> 02:52:34.88 step back and and I feel like that was helpful and is helpful to me I guess all the time
02:52:34.88 --> 02:52:41.68 because I'm always like taking a step back and saying hey well I'm not really doing what's what
02:52:41.68 --> 02:52:47.20 am I what's driving this need to do this particular thing or what's making me do this other
02:52:47.20 --> 02:52:54.000 thing or why am I not doing something else and it seems like when you go into these extreme situations
02:52:55.28 --> 02:53:00.64 it's another time where it happens like when you're freaking dog ass tired or you're freezing cold
02:53:00.64 --> 02:53:06.08 you know it's like I was telling that story about my my SDV buddy that was just like I don't want
02:53:06.08 --> 02:53:11.92 to be doing this anymore and you take that step back you feel anything like that like in these
02:53:11.92 --> 02:53:17.52 sweat lodges where bro you can only suffer so much and then you got to just like take a step
02:53:17.52 --> 02:53:25.92 back and look at your whole life except yeah you have to let go see it's like yeah it's the art
02:53:25.92 --> 02:53:33.12 of like letting go it's art of detaching like and that's when you go from that kind of physical
02:53:33.12 --> 02:53:41.68 to spiritual where where you're no longer holding onto anything and you're just being and that's when
02:53:41.68 --> 02:53:54.64 we spend so much time asking and wanting things but no time listening just being still and listening
02:53:55.92 --> 02:54:02.64 well you know in those places you know I'm like you know your mind's going a million miles an hour
02:54:02.64 --> 02:54:05.92 and you're like I got to get high like all these things like oh this things are popping up everywhere
02:54:05.92 --> 02:54:11.12 I don't know Betty I wonder she's not who's Betty like all these things are coming right and
02:54:11.12 --> 02:54:16.40 and then also when you when you learn to quiet your mind and be still and begin to listen the
02:54:16.40 --> 02:54:22.000 things that you need for your life out of the nothingness comes to that I don't know how to explain
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:29.20 it scientifically or by like an elaborate like whatever but I'm telling you right now the the
02:54:29.92 --> 02:54:35.44 when you look at like Jesus for instance right like Jesus really like I mean I mean Jesus wasn't
02:54:35.44 --> 02:54:43.28 a religion okay Jesus basically said love your neighbor has yourself well to love yourself you
02:54:43.28 --> 02:54:49.52 have to know who self is or you only love the idea of self so you have to know what your self is
02:54:49.52 --> 02:54:57.44 right and then the kingdom of God it's in you okay it's actually within you and then like those
02:54:57.44 --> 02:55:03.92 leaders of the day is like by the way those dudes are liars and they're gonna kill me but you know
02:55:03.92 --> 02:55:10.80 whatever so he was a cataclysm he was a nuclear bomb dropped on culture of the day okay so
02:55:10.80 --> 02:55:16.72 we think of cataclysm we think of meteorites or floods or earth fractures or whatever solar flares
02:55:18.32 --> 02:55:24.32 but a powerful idea that speaks to the core of who we all are as people is a cataclysm and he was a
02:55:24.32 --> 02:55:29.92 cataclysm of the day but his message was simple right you have to love what you have to
02:55:29.92 --> 02:55:34.08 you have to love yourself we have to know who itself is and you have to love yourself then you have to
02:55:34.08 --> 02:55:41.28 love your neighbor the same way right and then the kingdom of God it's in you it's in you so you have
02:55:41.28 --> 02:55:46.64 to go within and so what does he do he goes up there and he doesn't have food or water for 40 days right
02:55:46.64 --> 02:55:51.44 and then you know they kill him and then by the way he comes walking through walls like by the way
02:55:51.44 --> 02:55:59.12 you never die okay thanks for the message right I mean that's the message like if you look at
02:55:59.12 --> 02:56:05.12 through all about history it's always the same know that itself it's inscribed in the oracle of
02:56:05.12 --> 02:56:09.44 delhi and every year we have a different saying it heroes and horses that's on the belt buckle
02:56:09.44 --> 02:56:15.28 set the guys get when they graduate it's coveted belt buckle and everyone they have a different
02:56:15.28 --> 02:56:21.60 saying in this year is gonna is the saying is know that I sell and you know one year we had
02:56:21.60 --> 02:56:25.84 think greater than you feel you know we have all these other ones but know that I self and I think
02:56:25.84 --> 02:56:32.000 that's just kind of kind of stay there forever now I'm done making up slogans I think like
02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.48 know that myself is a powerful thing right and so that is inscribed in gold at the oracle of delhi
02:56:38.48 --> 02:56:47.04 1400 BCE it hasn't nothing has changed it's set for know that myself I'll caveat that or else
02:56:47.04 --> 02:56:53.44 other people that actually know what you are will use you to create their own kingdom and enslave you
02:56:53.44 --> 02:57:01.68 that's that's what it is this is this is reminding me of uh I don't know we were doing a podcast
02:57:01.68 --> 02:57:07.84 a while ago and we asked a question something it was like legit I think it was legitimate dating advice
02:57:07.84 --> 02:57:13.36 someone was asking or they got dumped or something like this and so I was saying and I've given
02:57:13.36 --> 02:57:17.92 this answer a few times on the podcast hey when you're when you get dumped and you get broke up
02:57:17.92 --> 02:57:24.64 and you're all heartbroken I I try and explain that like hey the person that you were in love with
02:57:25.84 --> 02:57:31.68 that cheated on you or that you know ran away or whatever they did the person that you were
02:57:31.68 --> 02:57:38.000 in love with actually didn't exist they didn't exist that girl that seemed so sweet but then she
02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:44.24 cheated on you or whatever you were in love with this idea of this person and and now it's gone
02:57:44.24 --> 02:57:47.76 you have to accept the fact that the person that you were in love with actually didn't exist and it
02:57:47.76 --> 02:57:52.24 kind of is a good thing you go oh wait a second I'm all heartbroken now whom I can
02:57:52.24 --> 02:57:55.76 marry now whom I need to spend the rest of my life with oh no actually the person that I thought
02:57:55.76 --> 02:57:58.96 I was going to marry and the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with didn't
02:57:58.96 --> 02:58:04.88 exist that this girl was not a good person and now I got to learn that now I can move forward
02:58:04.88 --> 02:58:11.36 but what I'm relating this to what you're talking about is when people look at themselves and they
02:58:11.36 --> 02:58:16.32 got this idea of themselves that they're kind of maybe not in love with but they at least like yeah
02:58:16.32 --> 02:58:23.76 you know I'm this or I'm that I'm a fighter I'm a soldier I'm a Wall Street dude or whatever
02:58:23.76 --> 02:58:28.000 you are you have this idea of yourself like hey you know I kind of love who I am
02:58:29.60 --> 02:58:36.32 and then there's something going on where you actually don't love that person and because you know
02:58:36.32 --> 02:58:41.84 that that person that your portraying doesn't actually exist it's a projection it's a projection
02:58:41.84 --> 02:58:46.72 and so that's a rude awakening and I think that can be a rude awakening when someone gets out of
02:58:46.72 --> 02:58:54.000 the military and is all of a sudden saying oh the person that I was which was a soldier a sailor
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:59.52 an airman or marine that person all of a sudden they literally don't exist anymore and you can
02:58:59.52 --> 02:59:05.36 try and hang onto it but it's got it's it's not gonna be there you don't like you said you don't
02:59:05.36 --> 02:59:10.08 have your friends you don't have a word you don't have a puttoon anymore you don't have a puttoon anymore
02:59:10.08 --> 02:59:16.48 it's think about how heartbreaking it is when you don't have a puttoon anymore it's a freaking
02:59:16.48 --> 02:59:22.000 horror show it's everything I love a sailpatoon and all of a sudden you don't have a sailpatoon anymore
02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:26.64 you don't have it doesn't exist anymore for you and so you can't you you have to figure out okay
02:59:26.64 --> 02:59:35.68 what what am I really and you got a dig in there and figure that out and you know I think for me again I was
02:59:35.68 --> 02:59:42.16 always like a rebellious kid growing up blah blah blah and I always was like questioning myself and
02:59:42.88 --> 02:59:49.20 I don't know I think when when even when I was in the seal teams like there was I look at some
02:59:49.20 --> 02:59:55.12 leadership and be like this guy is whatever this this guy's not me right this guy's legitimately
02:59:55.12 --> 02:59:59.84 not me like I know who my guys are I don't know what we're like but that guy's he's not really
02:59:59.84 --> 03:00:04.72 one of us and there's a bunch of people that aren't really one of us so I always kind of felt that
03:00:04.72 --> 03:00:09.52 and it was okay when okay now I'm gonna move on to my next job whatever I got out of the navy
03:00:09.52 --> 03:00:17.12 retired from the navy but man trying to figure out trying to make sure that you know who you are
03:00:18.56 --> 03:00:23.20 and make sure that who you are isn't a construct I just used your word to the day
03:00:23.20 --> 03:00:26.24 construct I'm the one who I don't use that word that's an interesting word I don't you don't
03:00:26.24 --> 03:00:34.08 really use that word that construct that you built it might not be for real and if it's not for real
03:00:34.08 --> 03:00:38.56 that's gonna it's gonna sting and all but it's gonna sting it's gonna hurt but cool now you know
03:00:38.56 --> 03:00:44.64 that now you can figure it out now you can get in there start doing work baseline you got to hit
03:00:44.64 --> 03:00:49.68 though you got to hit the bottom of the bowl you know where where where the projection doesn't protect
03:00:49.68 --> 03:00:54.16 you anymore listen you can you can you can dress up all day put on the MMA stuff or whatever and
03:00:54.16 --> 03:00:58.40 until you know you get freaking spun kicked in the side of your head and then the projection doesn't
03:00:58.40 --> 03:01:03.44 work anymore right like and that's life we were all you know everybody's living some form of
03:01:03.44 --> 03:01:09.52 projection at some point in their life and you know the thing is as those projections fade you
03:01:09.52 --> 03:01:14.72 become depressed and you become disenfranchised and the thing is like you don't have to be if you
03:01:14.72 --> 03:01:23.28 have one job really in your life is to wake up and just be yourself and then you can't fail
03:01:24.08 --> 03:01:29.12 it's impossible like sure it doesn't mean I do dumb shit I do dumb shit I say things I have
03:01:29.12 --> 03:01:33.28 around second gas my shit I don't call my wife I should have never said that she's like honey
03:01:34.56 --> 03:01:39.92 but then she's like it doesn't matter because that's just how you are just be okay with that and so
03:01:39.92 --> 03:01:45.52 you just if everybody just woke up and just and just where there's authentic self the entire world
03:01:45.52 --> 03:01:50.64 would be a completely different place like think about like think about filters think about a filter on
03:01:50.64 --> 03:01:56.72 a cell phone right you got some like lady where like the other Botox is failing shit's going down
03:01:56.72 --> 03:02:01.68 probably was hot exosperies and Dallas like you know but you know she's kind of like that she's
03:02:01.68 --> 03:02:06.24 kind of a little trophy and then and then she puts the filter on and you're like boom right
03:02:06.24 --> 03:02:10.32 and love with the projection of themselves you know it's like the worst thing is you see
03:02:10.32 --> 03:02:15.76 everybody sitting on the bus and I'm sitting on the bus you know the today and everyone's like
03:02:15.76 --> 03:02:22.24 you can see them over there like liking they're like and they're like LOL LOL like heart hurt LOL like
03:02:22.24 --> 03:02:26.80 happy smiley face right like they're the saddest looking people you know dudes like the
03:02:26.80 --> 03:02:31.76 alleys or gross or mask is on croquet they're hair is just fucked up they got two cell phones
03:02:31.76 --> 03:02:39.84 like LOL LOL right it's all a projection it's a total projection and so like we have to stop
03:02:39.84 --> 03:02:46.64 being projections and get back to the basics of who we are but unfortunately we put projections
03:02:46.64 --> 03:02:52.64 in these places where we try to be like somebody else rather than being ourselves and that's
03:02:52.64 --> 03:02:59.92 just drawing the fabric of humanity and you know if you look at you know you look at Chinese culture
03:03:01.76 --> 03:03:06.56 they're all simulated everyone's wearing the same clothes everyone's doing the same things everyone's
03:03:06.56 --> 03:03:10.72 serving the same people they're all born from Chinese mothers they're all you know they all have this
03:03:11.60 --> 03:03:17.52 they all have this plan in place this 10,000 year destiny okay what are we trying to do we're trying
03:03:17.52 --> 03:03:21.12 to like you know we're trying to make the rent you know we're trying to like you know we're trying
03:03:21.12 --> 03:03:26.32 to pass the bill you know we're trying to you know you look at these people well I don't want that
03:03:26.32 --> 03:03:31.76 either that is a nightmare there is no individualality like what do you exist you exist to serve the
03:03:31.76 --> 03:03:37.60 state well you exist here in North America to serve the projection the projection oh I'm going to
03:03:37.60 --> 03:03:43.20 go why I'm going to buy the car so that when people see me they'll think I'm successful even though
03:03:43.20 --> 03:03:48.40 I work at in and out which I'm not no dings on and out actually props to the in and out
03:03:48.40 --> 03:03:52.48 yeah by the way then they just do some great stuff or something they would do
03:03:53.12 --> 03:03:55.68 co-vaxxers and I don't know shout out to the in and out
03:03:55.68 --> 03:04:00.96 they're good writers like you know or whatever like you you but like you'll see people will buy
03:04:00.96 --> 03:04:07.44 things and do things and extend themselves to a point to fulfill a projection and it's so empty
03:04:07.44 --> 03:04:12.48 because there's never enough there's always a new thing there's always another thing so your
03:04:12.48 --> 03:04:16.56 whole life is giving me a projection and that's why people are the quintessentially lost
03:04:16.56 --> 03:04:23.76 they are they are literally have their self standing next to them in their life and they're completely
03:04:23.76 --> 03:04:30.16 in the material realm everything is material the five senses there's nothing else beyond that so in
03:04:30.16 --> 03:04:35.84 that case I have to chase these projections down get that one get the next one get the next one
03:04:35.84 --> 03:04:40.96 so on and so forth that's why like filters and all those things like they're cancer because
03:04:40.96 --> 03:04:46.32 they they they are nothing more than a project you don't look like that you don't you're not
03:04:46.32 --> 03:04:52.80 that way like the crate it's if you take a step back and think about this hey I got a
03:04:53.36 --> 03:04:59.84 when I send a picture to my friends I'm gonna run it through a computer program that makes me
03:04:59.84 --> 03:05:11.36 look better like that's crazy because it drives it it's put us into all forms of chaos as a society
03:05:11.36 --> 03:05:16.96 right like where I mean you think about you know this whole thing on climate change everything that's
03:05:16.96 --> 03:05:21.44 happening in the world is like I think the debate is like are we causing climate change or are we just
03:05:21.44 --> 03:05:28.40 destroying the environment right well we are 100% destroying the environment um and for what
03:05:29.04 --> 03:05:38.48 so you can have like another table another mahogany table okay like or more diamonds you know
03:05:38.48 --> 03:05:42.48 because I love you and I want you to have this diamond that was mined by children
03:05:43.12 --> 03:05:47.12 in Africa it smuggled over here so that we can be together for a year
03:05:48.08 --> 03:05:53.36 and then you can take it out of everything I have but you know it's it's this whole bizarre
03:05:53.36 --> 03:05:59.44 thing where it's like we don't even care about anything except for enforcing our own projections
03:05:59.44 --> 03:06:04.16 so it's like hey maybe we shouldn't like chop down every tree because maybe what I breathe out
03:06:04.16 --> 03:06:08.88 the tree breeze in with the tree breeze out I breathe in maybe we shouldn't be dumping the chemicals into
03:06:08.88 --> 03:06:14.16 the rivers what is that almost every river in North America now contains glycophate in it right so
03:06:14.16 --> 03:06:20.80 it's bleeding in from um and pk from mass farming and agriculture the soils dying I mean I'm
03:06:20.80 --> 03:06:27.84 with ranchers I'm in rural I'm in agriculture people that's my life and you you listen to these old
03:06:27.84 --> 03:06:33.20 guys kneel down and pick up the soil dead right and where's all this stuff going where's all these
03:06:33.20 --> 03:06:40.40 things going what's happening around us is that people only care about their own projections
03:06:40.40 --> 03:06:45.60 and the very things that give them life they're destroying to further something that does only
03:06:45.60 --> 03:06:52.64 exist fictitiously as an idea and it's a scary time to be living in right now it's like you know
03:06:52.64 --> 03:06:56.96 here we are like Ukraine like Russia like look out like wow like they're coming they're gonna get us
03:06:56.96 --> 03:07:04.88 all like their actions and and it's like okay but you're really concerned about their borders but
03:07:04.88 --> 03:07:12.000 like what about like our borders like aren't those important to know only the ones in Ukraine
03:07:13.28 --> 03:07:22.64 and it's you get sold these illusions and and in turn we destroy every single thing around us
03:07:22.64 --> 03:07:32.000 including ourselves and if we don't change we're coming into an epoch we're coming into a time
03:07:32.80 --> 03:07:39.76 a real time that we will become unrecognizable to ourselves and when I see guys coming and they're
03:07:39.76 --> 03:07:45.60 on 11 medications or on 8 medications there have been in therapy for 10 years and they're unrecognizable
03:07:45.60 --> 03:07:51.68 to themselves they are unrecognizable they look in the mirror they don't know what they are
03:07:51.68 --> 03:07:59.84 they only exist as a projection of an identity and you know yeah it's like sorry for the
03:07:59.84 --> 03:08:05.76 doing gloom you know believe me you listen to this podcast little bit more we got to do
03:08:05.76 --> 03:08:11.04 we got to play there is like there is like an IT for he's like a machete like
03:08:11.04 --> 03:08:19.36 I get the the weird thing is is as you look at this stuff in a large scale
03:08:19.36 --> 03:08:24.72 all these things are in place you know when you just were saying that about vets
03:08:25.68 --> 03:08:33.20 you're on a bunch of medications and you're being basically subdued you know you're being subdued
03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:40.56 and it's not just vets it's like humans humans are being subdued look we don't really actually
03:08:40.56 --> 03:08:45.84 want you to do anything we don't actually want you to come up with your own ideas we don't
03:08:45.84 --> 03:08:51.60 actually want you to write your own freaking books we don't want you to create something what we want
03:08:51.60 --> 03:08:58.56 you to do is continue to feed our machine that we've got work and over here that's what we want
03:08:58.56 --> 03:09:03.36 we want to feed our machine and we don't want you to feed your own machine and that that's
03:09:04.56 --> 03:09:10.48 that's like what is actually happening because people spend as I don't know what you say 37
03:09:10.48 --> 03:09:14.96 years in front of a screen or whatever it was you're not gaining when you're doing that that's not
03:09:14.96 --> 03:09:20.64 for you that's for them that's what they can sell you they can sell you to whoever their
03:09:20.64 --> 03:09:25.36 advertisers are so you can buy more of their stuff that's what's happening it's your energy they need
03:09:25.36 --> 03:09:36.32 your energy see everything is energy they need you and I say they okay like corporate
03:09:36.32 --> 03:09:44.000 accresies government whatever it is marketing companies data capture people whatever you see they need
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:50.08 your attention in your attention is your energy and that is the impetus for them to grow but if you're
03:09:50.08 --> 03:09:58.48 using your own energy to do your own thing that's problematic that's scary that's really scary for
03:09:58.48 --> 03:10:02.88 that right it's terrible and they can't have it for anybody running around so what they want you
03:10:02.88 --> 03:10:07.04 running around with a projection you need all these things to help your projection and it is
03:10:08.40 --> 03:10:14.000 this is like almost cliche right now it's cliche for me to say what I'm about to say there are
03:10:14.88 --> 03:10:20.64 psychologists and scientists and computer programmers or whatever they're called sitting
03:10:21.28 --> 03:10:29.28 figuring out literal ways to make you look at the screen more to add it to you to that that's
03:10:29.28 --> 03:10:33.60 what they're actually doing they're actually doing that they're actually doing that and you're
03:10:33.60 --> 03:10:37.60 by the way you're paying them to do it in many ways you're actually giving them money to do this
03:10:37.60 --> 03:10:42.56 so that they can get you to not think for yourself and I'm not saying like oh think for yourself
03:10:42.56 --> 03:10:46.000 come up with some crazy don't think for yourself yeah like actually think about what's going on
03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:50.56 around you instead you're just receiving what someone else is telling you which what they're
03:10:50.56 --> 03:10:55.20 telling you to do is waste more time looking at this and and and to buy whatever product it is
03:10:55.20 --> 03:11:00.56 that they're making this is what what's actually happening I think about like what have you
03:11:00.56 --> 03:11:05.60 read the middlegram experiments oh yeah it's crazy right yeah well two thirds of the people killed
03:11:05.60 --> 03:11:12.80 the person because they got a white coat told them to right so it's already figured out we already
03:11:12.80 --> 03:11:18.32 understand how to like grow human beings and to get them to give their attention and focus into
03:11:18.32 --> 03:11:24.32 developing whatever whatever it is is going for your attention needs you it doesn't exist without you
03:11:24.32 --> 03:11:31.76 I mean our founding fathers are pretty smart we the people okay you know they're interested
03:11:31.76 --> 03:11:37.20 that there's a power associated with the people you know the people united the people you know
03:11:37.20 --> 03:11:43.28 believing in the goodness and the opportunity that was afforded by this nation and and instead
03:11:43.28 --> 03:11:50.24 we we have fractured ourselves among the most trivial things and then given our energy and then
03:11:50.24 --> 03:11:57.12 we can plan about the very thing that we feed to build we can plan about it when we are
03:11:57.12 --> 03:12:03.28 responsible for paying for the bricks the prison keepers the uniforms everything and so
03:12:03.28 --> 03:12:07.92 turn your attention to something else if you took that same time you know between 14 and 23
03:12:07.92 --> 03:12:13.68 years watching TV in your life let's just say take one year out of that maybe get 22 years in
03:12:13.68 --> 03:12:21.76 Netflix and all right take one of those years and and just solely dedicated to yourself and if you do
03:12:22.32 --> 03:12:29.84 well you will regain time because time is accelerating extremely fast and it's accelerating because
03:12:30.88 --> 03:12:37.36 because time is only realized by the experiences that are contained in it right so like like
03:12:37.36 --> 03:12:45.68 you know I've heard it said like one million years with one event or 10 minutes with 50,000 events
03:12:46.32 --> 03:12:52.16 every moment of our life is filled with with with with an experience and so we realized time and time
03:12:52.16 --> 03:12:57.20 accelerates and we accelerate our own time and life it's like at the end of the day you're like
03:12:58.08 --> 03:13:05.20 man like you feel like you live the lifetime because you realized every moment of that day
03:13:05.20 --> 03:13:12.32 and none of it was spent with you none of it and so you feel disconnected all right well don't worry
03:13:12.32 --> 03:13:19.52 take a vacation down the Disney we're gonna get you patched up you know have a couple margaritas
03:13:19.52 --> 03:13:27.28 and eat four meals a day it's vacation can soon right and so this built-in acceleration that's
03:13:27.28 --> 03:13:34.24 happening that we feel in the world right now is caused because all of our energy is directed towards
03:13:34.24 --> 03:13:42.40 that and so I think that we can walk away and you know I've walked away you know I kind of started
03:13:42.40 --> 03:13:45.68 out when I first started this I didn't know it's social media I had nothing I'm like okay I'm
03:13:45.68 --> 03:13:50.88 starting a foundation like I got to get an Instagram you know so I used to look back I like the
03:13:50.88 --> 03:13:56.24 Instagram I had it was like I didn't I didn't even know what a hashtag was you know I was like
03:13:56.24 --> 03:14:01.60 it I was like it was like me like chopping wood and I'm like do work or something I had the worst
03:14:01.60 --> 03:14:05.28 things but then they kind of grew and I got to like almost 20,000 people and I was like sharing
03:14:05.28 --> 03:14:10.72 ideas and then and then I you know throughout you know my experience of going through the program
03:14:10.72 --> 03:14:15.92 every season because I'm out there doing it all right I'm not out there like standing there like you
03:14:15.92 --> 03:14:21.84 know I'm living it with the guys I'm feeling it I'm feeling ice I'm feeling the cold I'm you know
03:14:21.84 --> 03:14:26.64 I'm hitting the ground riding the cold so I'm like at 10,000, 11,000 feet I'm building the
03:14:26.64 --> 03:14:31.92 can I'm feeling every moment I'm in the sweat lodge I'm doing I'm not like this like kind of passive
03:14:31.92 --> 03:14:39.28 participant I'm there and then I just realize I have to walk away like I have to just do it so I
03:14:39.28 --> 03:14:45.12 just I just deleted it and I just walked away and man all these like anxieties and things like
03:14:45.12 --> 03:14:50.16 and what a way you know of course like my foundation has it and all those kind of things and then like
03:14:50.16 --> 03:14:56.56 I don't know like a year later I was like I'm gonna start it off again I got a message
03:14:56.56 --> 03:15:01.36 just here at the world and what do I start doing next thing I know I'm sucking back in the
03:15:01.36 --> 03:15:05.52 hole I'm in there and I'm doing this and then I just and I just stopped I was like I'm done for
03:15:05.52 --> 03:15:11.12 the rest of my life I'm never doing that again and it's like it's the battered wife's a drovita
03:15:11.12 --> 03:15:15.68 that's like that's what I had and and I looked and people can choose whatever they want to do
03:15:15.68 --> 03:15:21.28 whatever but I'm just saying for my life I needed to realize that my energy need to be directed
03:15:21.28 --> 03:15:27.12 at something else and that I wasn't being you know I wasn't fulfilling and maximizing my potentials
03:15:27.12 --> 03:15:32.32 of person because I was spending my time just start and I was like you know consciously like this
03:15:32.32 --> 03:15:36.48 is not a projection this is who I am this is but then of course I'm like I don't like that
03:15:36.48 --> 03:15:40.96 I will love handle like I'm like I'm gonna get on a side shot here with the axe
03:15:41.52 --> 03:15:47.20 then the remote will earn is here to photoshop right away like photoshop you know just you know
03:15:47.20 --> 03:15:51.44 three bucks you get the abs it's no big deal this is the freaking man wilderness filter
03:15:52.48 --> 03:15:59.76 yeah exactly exactly so you know so I'm trying to change like I we haven't bought meat from the store
03:15:59.76 --> 03:16:07.84 in four years you know I sold my beloved pickup truck to my good buddy team guy and I bought a
03:16:07.84 --> 03:16:16.40 66 foot by 17 foot wide geothermal greenhouse and an excavator and working my land and you know we
03:16:16.40 --> 03:16:21.84 have the ranch and you know training my horses and like my kids like they don't have any tech
03:16:21.84 --> 03:16:27.12 they don't have any screen I have the iPad and many of those things teaching them the real basic
03:16:27.12 --> 03:16:34.56 things like and I started realizing how much time I was actually spending doing the things that
03:16:34.56 --> 03:16:42.56 I'm actually railing against you know and so little tiny changes one step out of time you know
03:16:42.56 --> 03:16:47.68 so do you not have a vehicle no I have a vehicle but no I had this truck I had the 75
03:16:47.68 --> 03:16:53.76 forward high boy put a 429 co-project and I was sick red lifted it was all you know it was cool
03:16:53.76 --> 03:16:58.72 guy like one mile of the gallon when I started like a bird died you know it was like that kind of
03:16:58.72 --> 03:17:04.16 truck and I loved it and I always wanted that grown up as a kid you know I mean the forward high boy
03:17:04.16 --> 03:17:10.56 was cool when I was a kid and but I sold that and I bought things and and I've really
03:17:10.56 --> 03:17:16.40 changed the relationships in my life and even the things that I exposed myself to and the
03:17:16.40 --> 03:17:22.32 content and those kind of things radical quiet time in the morning you know like like not just like
03:17:22.32 --> 03:17:28.16 working out and getting in my son or whatever but like like learning to just sit there and be still
03:17:28.56 --> 03:17:34.16 and thoughtless and then like you know get to the place where I can do that for 40 minutes without
03:17:34.16 --> 03:17:40.16 without a thought and just breathe nothing and then all of a sudden I have all these realizations
03:17:40.16 --> 03:17:46.16 about things I don't know where they come from I do know where they come from right you get plugged in
03:17:47.28 --> 03:17:52.000 that energy is real and you get plugged into it that's what guys find listen there's days in the
03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:56.64 backcountry where it's like everyone's kind of chatty and then they'll be like days where you're on a horse
03:17:56.64 --> 03:18:05.60 and it's like nobody says a word it's just like man you can like it's amazing everyone's
03:18:05.60 --> 03:18:10.88 real talking about the first like 12 minutes of a forced road march you know this is gonna smell
03:18:10.88 --> 03:18:15.28 a little bit of a little bit of a little bit like 30 minutes in dead silence for the next four
03:18:15.28 --> 03:18:20.24 hours as you just on but out you trapped in there in your own little brain do you think that you were
03:18:20.24 --> 03:18:25.44 do you think that you made the sail team or sail team is made you?
03:18:29.04 --> 03:18:34.72 probably a little bit of both well yes a little bit of both I can I can tell you like from my
03:18:34.72 --> 03:18:38.80 experience of like going through buds I was never gonna quite a never thought about quitting I was just like
03:18:39.60 --> 03:18:46.48 I was so stoked and happy like this is what we're doing this is what I'm doing I it took me a while
03:18:46.48 --> 03:18:52.08 to figure out like I wanted to be a good seal you know that's what I wanted to be once I got
03:18:52.08 --> 03:18:57.04 in the teams I wanted to be a good seal and it took me a while to figure out what that actually was and
03:18:57.04 --> 03:19:02.24 I don't think I really figured it out until probably about five years after I retired I think I would
03:19:02.24 --> 03:19:07.84 still be mod if I'm still working on it right now but you know there were different things that
03:19:07.84 --> 03:19:13.52 I did along the way where it seemed like the team guy thing to do and then as I got older and
03:19:13.52 --> 03:19:18.56 figured out oh yeah that wasn't really exactly a good team guy thing to do now there's some
03:19:18.56 --> 03:19:24.16 core tenants that never changed and I think the ultimate one is like if you're a good team guy
03:19:24.64 --> 03:19:31.04 you put your team in front of yourself and that was seem clear to me from day one and I think that
03:19:31.68 --> 03:19:38.16 that is the ultimate sort of the ultimate quality of a good team guys like oh that guy he will do
03:19:38.16 --> 03:19:43.12 he will he he's gonna put you ahead of him and if you have a platoon full of guys and they're all
03:19:43.12 --> 03:19:50.72 putting each other ahead of themselves like that's a freaking kick ass platoon so I kind of
03:19:50.72 --> 03:19:56.64 knew that I kind of felt that way like even with the friends I had growing up it was sort of that
03:19:56.64 --> 03:20:01.76 same mentality about not being selfish and not putting yourself like not looking out for yourself
03:20:02.56 --> 03:20:09.84 and and so when I got in the teams that core belief was probably it was probably an
03:20:09.84 --> 03:20:14.56 existence when I got when I was when I got in the teams of like hey you don't put yourself
03:20:14.56 --> 03:20:21.84 ahead of your friends I think that's what I was kind of that's what me and my friends were like
03:20:21.84 --> 03:20:28.64 when I was a kid and I think that was that core tenant was there so did it get honed hell yeah they
03:20:28.64 --> 03:20:37.04 got honed but I'd say it was kind of their man yeah it's like something I feel like when I showed
03:20:37.04 --> 03:20:42.08 up at buzz it was like I felt really inferior to everybody like in the sense that
03:20:43.12 --> 03:20:47.92 everyone I was like ripped and like they were like all like you know played football and
03:20:47.92 --> 03:20:52.32 everybody was like sports athletes and everyone there and I just felt so inferior I had like the
03:20:52.32 --> 03:20:59.04 shitty tattoo like everyone made fun of not my classmates but that was the shitty tattoo
03:20:59.04 --> 03:21:07.52 oh I have a I still have it I have like a transformer tattoo but it's just like a shitty
03:21:07.52 --> 03:21:14.32 outline that was done by a friend of mine like on this arm and whatever but like I got this thing
03:21:14.32 --> 03:21:18.24 and they used to say think it up here and show everyone your stupid head and then I had to get
03:21:18.24 --> 03:21:23.04 up on the truck and then they would like everyone laugh of course everyone would laugh and
03:21:23.04 --> 03:21:27.44 then say when come down and I remember we had this one chief my instructor out there for
03:21:27.44 --> 03:21:31.44 get his like he was the one that was constantly calling me out he's like get up here and try
03:21:31.44 --> 03:21:34.48 when you're stupid tattoo and I was like whatever sounds like go out there I shall
03:21:34.48 --> 03:21:38.72 am tattoo everyone did laugh and then we'd take off on the run you know kind of the thing
03:21:38.72 --> 03:21:46.000 and then one day he's up there and I was like he's like you know if I had that tattoo like that
03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:51.52 I think I would just kill myself and I was like well if I had legs like yours I would kill myself
03:21:51.52 --> 03:21:58.96 oh damn and everybody was like and then everybody laughed for me so I I proceeded to eat
03:21:58.96 --> 03:22:03.84 a mouthful of sand and I did the run every time I lost the sand because I would slowly do a little
03:22:04.64 --> 03:22:11.52 like I would stop it I have to refill refill and I'd put the sand in and I'd run but all
03:22:11.52 --> 03:22:15.92 these instructors came up to me and they were like we got props for you because that we know
03:22:15.92 --> 03:22:21.84 that like really sucks because they're like you can't drop you know and but I just kind of like
03:22:22.72 --> 03:22:28.32 going through that like I did have that belief in myself like I had a belief in myself and I would
03:22:28.32 --> 03:22:32.64 look at that the instructors not in the sense of like they're out to keep me but that like if they
03:22:32.64 --> 03:22:38.40 could be on the other side of this experience then I could be too that's all I ever thought about was
03:22:38.40 --> 03:22:43.44 like if he can do it I can do it you know it's like that was that movie the edge or whatever
03:22:43.44 --> 03:22:51.60 with Anthony Hopkins and who's the dude that just shot the guy oh Alec Baldwin he just shot
03:22:51.60 --> 03:22:58.56 it that I'm a female actually yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but Marie did that movie the edge
03:22:59.20 --> 03:23:06.32 he's a little bit like what one man can do another man can do like and I kind of like I
03:23:06.32 --> 03:23:11.04 mean I would say I was like thinking about that movie but like in my own way I I thought like
03:23:11.04 --> 03:23:15.68 and if somebody else can be standing there with that shirt on I could be standing there with that
03:23:15.68 --> 03:23:21.28 shirt on you know and I think pressure I think those experiences just reveal who we really are
03:23:21.76 --> 03:23:27.20 and I think that everybody could make it if they had the ability to look in at that you know that
03:23:27.20 --> 03:23:35.68 fire and the gut or whatever but too often not it's too enticing to ring out I was uh I was not
03:23:35.68 --> 03:23:39.68 graded anything right I wasn't the fastest runner I wasn't the fastest one or kind like I
03:23:39.68 --> 03:23:44.40 said you I wasn't like a great athlete I was like maybe slightly below average athlete in high
03:23:44.40 --> 03:23:49.44 school and then even I got to the team so it was like I was never gonna win anything yeah so I was
03:23:49.44 --> 03:23:56.80 felt like I had to work harder and to be a good team guy and the quitting thing is crazy actually
03:23:57.52 --> 03:24:05.04 when you look at the things that happened with people like incredible athletes like I was literally
03:24:05.04 --> 03:24:10.72 above the low average athlete and I was young you know so like even if you went to college you
03:24:10.72 --> 03:24:15.76 your mortgage developed with me the difference between a 18 year old and a 22 year old is a big
03:24:15.76 --> 03:24:24.24 freaking difference but you know I I had college athletes D1 college athletes had an Olympic alternate
03:24:24.24 --> 03:24:31.68 for gymnastics which is crazy quit uh wrestler D1 wrestler quit. Ressler really? Yes.
03:24:31.68 --> 03:24:38.72 You think I think so I think so I'm actually I want my one of my swim buddies
03:24:38.72 --> 03:24:46.88 rang out in like um the after hell week in dive phase we're doing something in the pool and
03:24:46.88 --> 03:24:51.84 I'm I think we're doing buddy breathing in the pool and so I'm passing it my regulator and I'm
03:24:51.84 --> 03:24:58.32 taking two breaths and he's taking nine and this dude was from like Iowa or something he's never
03:24:58.32 --> 03:25:04.24 really the ocean before and he was super pale so he was just sunburn he looked bright red like the
03:25:04.24 --> 03:25:10.000 entire time and and so I'm doing you know taking whatever two breaths given him he's taking nine
03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:14.000 and finally he just stands up we're in four feet of water and the pool he just stands up and he
03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:20.80 goes at surface and I'm like down there and I think well okay so I stand up and he's just calling
03:25:20.80 --> 03:25:25.92 out like hey I quit I'm out of here this is I'm not doing this after hell week so that water thing
03:25:25.92 --> 03:25:32.40 can get a little bit crazy on some people yeah the water thing is legit you know I've had some so
03:25:32.40 --> 03:25:39.20 I mean I was drowned in Afghanistan and yeah I had like some I've had that happen I had some
03:25:40.72 --> 03:25:48.88 cross in a river and the a rope that I was attached to got wrapped around a rock and I'm really
03:25:48.88 --> 03:25:52.96 know how much I can say about because of the nature of where we were and all those things that
03:25:52.96 --> 03:25:59.04 were going to river I was in a river yeah and so basically I had gone down there once checked it out
03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:05.20 it was much more intense than anticipated you know and I had this like idea like about this water
03:26:05.20 --> 03:26:09.44 up and all those kind of things I'm getting studying it and there was a really there's a mission
03:26:09.44 --> 03:26:15.52 that we needed to get done that had not been successful previously and I was in this this this this
03:26:15.52 --> 03:26:19.92 space with with some guys and just kind of like really amped up on this you know first water up all the
03:26:19.92 --> 03:26:27.84 things so go down there the second time with like a hundred meters of one inch tubular nylon
03:26:27.84 --> 03:26:34.64 all tied together and right in the alice pack and the plan was that I would go upstream and offset
03:26:34.64 --> 03:26:39.20 and then swim down either side then pull the equipment set off a hoist system so that you know we
03:26:39.20 --> 03:26:44.80 could zip line all this stuff and get everybody across the sound of good so it was like a you know
03:26:44.80 --> 03:26:53.92 class for rapids way way way north and so it starts off I'm down there I got my my boots on
03:26:53.92 --> 03:26:57.68 I got my stuff in my second time now and I've been watching this thing drone footage all the
03:26:57.68 --> 03:27:01.60 things I've been observing this for a long time I understood the flow of the river and there was
03:27:01.60 --> 03:27:06.72 a dog leg which was like the point of no return like if you went there there was a huge cave and
03:27:06.72 --> 03:27:12.80 I would watch on the footage like logs like trees did go in there and like days later would be like
03:27:12.80 --> 03:27:20.24 blue come out so I knew if I went in there that I wouldn't live and so I go down there and
03:27:21.44 --> 03:27:25.92 I start going like upstream so now this is the you're executing the miss I'm well I'm doing
03:27:25.92 --> 03:27:32.000 the I'm basically doing the recon to see a proof of concept and so we're down there I got
03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:36.64 guys set up security the whole day I'm down there I'm like preling nervous I'm like whoa this is like
03:27:36.64 --> 03:27:42.24 I'm like insurance and like you know this is like really a wild place and there's huge cliffs
03:27:42.24 --> 03:27:47.36 so there's only kind of one way in this water to the to the river so I kind of start
03:27:47.36 --> 03:27:51.52 going up well I end up getting like sucked into a cave that I couldn't see it was just like a
03:27:51.52 --> 03:27:57.60 dark spot on the on the on the aerial and they like let all the rope go the rope can
03:27:57.60 --> 03:28:01.84 all tangled up around me I'm like a cat grabbing on the sides like I can't grab on anything so
03:28:01.84 --> 03:28:06.72 I'm end up making it to the beach now I can't I can't get back there's no way to get back
03:28:06.72 --> 03:28:10.72 unless I do that again I'm not going in that cave nobody has any ideas like one o'clock in the
03:28:10.72 --> 03:28:17.36 morning so finally I go up and I get the the rope and I get it taught and I'm on the beach and I'm
03:28:17.36 --> 03:28:24.24 like I sit down I have a rigor's belt on with a carabiner my boots fins and no shirt
03:28:24.24 --> 03:28:31.76 a pair of shorts and a speed out underneath because I have to contain that thing just kidding so
03:28:33.36 --> 03:28:40.48 that's a lot see it's a projection and so anyway I'm like so I'm sitting there and I can tell you I honestly
03:28:40.48 --> 03:28:45.36 felt like a lot of fear I felt afraid because like the waves were so big it was like whoa
03:28:46.56 --> 03:28:51.60 so I'm like okay okay like just like just fucking Michael helps it like you can do it that and like
03:28:51.60 --> 03:28:57.68 so I get into the water and I start like swimming as hard as I can and I was the unprepared for the
03:28:57.68 --> 03:29:06.80 violence of that water it literally swept me away and as I'm like flying down I'm like I kind of get
03:29:06.80 --> 03:29:12.08 like almost to where the dog leg is to get to the other side and so everybody's like in this
03:29:12.08 --> 03:29:17.12 water there's guys up here on this mountain and these two mountains and this is all like cliffs
03:29:17.52 --> 03:29:22.08 and it's kind of not cliff-y on the other side and you know that was the plan so as it's like
03:29:22.08 --> 03:29:26.80 turning like this I kind of get to here and there's a boulder in the center and the rope
03:29:26.80 --> 03:29:32.32 goes right around the boulder which just they're holding an anchor and I just become like a
03:29:32.32 --> 03:29:37.92 flapping parachute and it just sucks me underneath and my feet going underneath the boulder
03:29:38.72 --> 03:29:43.68 and I had a UDT life vest on so I pulled a little thing which I've never done in my whole training
03:29:44.000 --> 03:29:49.12 and I was like and it just ripped right off was like a toilet and my shoes are gone everything's
03:29:49.12 --> 03:29:55.52 gone. Fins gone shorts are gone. I'm in my speed of all this is happening very quick and I realize
03:29:55.52 --> 03:30:03.68 like I'm drowning and I try to unhook the carabiner physically can't I'm not strong enough and
03:30:03.68 --> 03:30:08.80 I'm no like cream puff like I I couldn't physically the current was so strong and I'm trying to move
03:30:08.80 --> 03:30:14.32 the rope one and a half inches to get it out of that and it was to stupid little like black
03:30:14.32 --> 03:30:19.60 issue like locking carabiner you know where I got to twist the thing a half turn and like
03:30:19.60 --> 03:30:24.24 and I'm like and I started like really I started drowning and I started seeing like you know
03:30:24.24 --> 03:30:28.24 these kind of like I guess like you would say a hallucination or whatever I started like seeing
03:30:28.24 --> 03:30:33.92 all kinds of crazy images and I started feeling like I'm going out unconscious like this is like
03:30:33.92 --> 03:30:39.04 and I remember saying like please god they'll let me like drown enough canis and and and then
03:30:39.04 --> 03:30:43.52 meanwhile these guys are like everyone's piling down off the hill like thinking I'm like dead
03:30:44.32 --> 03:30:49.84 they saw me like zip by and so they're heavowing and they're like heavowing heavowing there's a lot of
03:30:49.84 --> 03:30:55.84 rope so they end up like heavowing the rope off the rock and like I right when I'm like about to
03:30:55.84 --> 03:31:00.48 totally just drown and I remember the singing buzz dry drowning is better than wet drowning dry
03:31:00.48 --> 03:31:04.72 drowning is better I mean don't breathe in because you can be resuscitated but if you suck in
03:31:05.44 --> 03:31:10.56 your toast like all that water is going to go in your lungs you know being a medic like it too and
03:31:11.12 --> 03:31:15.52 I just have seen dry drowning is better than wet drowning and I just refused to breathe in and then
03:31:15.52 --> 03:31:21.28 awesome and I like pop up into the foam and I remember like gagging in and sucking all this foam
03:31:21.28 --> 03:31:26.48 and I'm like and I just started washing down the river again I'm just hitting rocks I'm like doing
03:31:26.48 --> 03:31:33.44 cartwheels I don't know which way is up and I'm like screaming help like to know buddy
03:31:34.08 --> 03:31:41.20 and and I'm like I remember like breathing in foam and I get to the other side which they could
03:31:41.20 --> 03:31:48.40 not access me because of the the terrain and I get to their side and I'm like I'm on land and I
03:31:48.40 --> 03:31:52.72 start like crawling you know super fast to get up on shore and then they just start dragging me
03:31:52.72 --> 03:31:58.88 on my face right they're like heav oh like and and I'm like getting dragged back into the river
03:31:58.88 --> 03:32:03.60 and so I get against this boulder there's a lot of slack in the line I do kind of like a squat
03:32:03.60 --> 03:32:07.68 like and I pop the beaner off and apparently everybody like fell down and they pull it back and
03:32:07.68 --> 03:32:13.60 they're like he's alive they thought I was dead they thought I had drowned so now I'm like in my
03:32:13.60 --> 03:32:18.72 speedo with no shoes on or anything in real bad guy land like and there's like people
03:32:18.72 --> 03:32:23.92 like lights clicking driftwood there's like and so I'm like I'm crawl underneath this like outcropping
03:32:23.92 --> 03:32:30.96 and I cover myself and mud because I saw it on predator and and I mean that's really what I did
03:32:30.96 --> 03:32:37.20 I remember you know like that scene you know and and so I cover myself and mud and I just lay
03:32:37.20 --> 03:32:46.08 there to like almost like probably an hour before first light and I'm like thinking I'm going to be
03:32:46.08 --> 03:32:53.20 the first seal that ever be captured like and I was like a fuck that and I'm like I got like
03:32:53.20 --> 03:32:59.28 sticks and like rocks like piled up and I'm just like and I'm freezing that like one of the
03:32:59.28 --> 03:33:03.92 coldest moments I've ever been in my life it was the water time what time it was it was
03:33:03.92 --> 03:33:11.44 August okay but it was cold yeah super cold and we were pretty damn close to as far
03:33:11.44 --> 03:33:20.88 north as you could go and so I'm like laying there and then I see like some nods like lights and
03:33:20.88 --> 03:33:24.96 the guys have made it around come down there scanning the shore and I like popped out and like
03:33:24.96 --> 03:33:30.80 here's like mud dude with like you know cool guy no like a speedo on no shoes well I had no shoes
03:33:30.80 --> 03:33:36.72 so like they have my bag though we got to get out of here now like some like you know we're
03:33:36.72 --> 03:33:40.48 hugging like I thought you're dead we're doing that whole thing so I get my clothes and I have no
03:33:40.48 --> 03:33:45.52 shoes on into teletooth I don't remember walking back I think I just like blacked out or something
03:33:45.52 --> 03:33:50.64 like because I was so cold and I have my shoes on and I was so you know I got my gun and got
03:33:50.64 --> 03:33:54.80 all my stuff got everything we go back get the base one of the guys there one of the OGA guys
03:33:54.80 --> 03:34:02.64 sons and team guy he runs one of the branches now so sons up we get back and he was there and he's
03:34:02.64 --> 03:34:09.04 like he's like in tears he's like gonna have a drink so we go up we go on the skiff and he's like
03:34:09.04 --> 03:34:13.44 I thought you're dead and I was like why do we do this like this is terrible like you should have
03:34:13.44 --> 03:34:17.60 never done this like blah blah so it gives me a drink we have a drink and I go back to my room
03:34:17.60 --> 03:34:26.16 and I'm like that was like whoa so back to like up and it up whatever move on well my team leader
03:34:26.16 --> 03:34:31.12 comes to me like a week later he's like hey brother I think you could do that again and I'm like
03:34:31.92 --> 03:34:36.32 I'm like sure definitely like oh my room my I'm so scared I don't want to do that like that
03:34:36.32 --> 03:34:40.96 was the worst experience of my whole life like but of course I'm like yeah I'm in definitely
03:34:40.96 --> 03:34:45.76 brother like for sure like so I started like watching call these YouTube videos and I started like
03:34:45.76 --> 03:34:50.08 river crossing all this kind of stuff I'm like okay like and so I order all this equipment from the
03:34:51.04 --> 03:34:56.24 PJs and all this stuff comes up I got throwbacks rescue stuff I'm like inflatable
03:34:56.24 --> 03:35:01.28 is protects the whole deal long story sure I go back down there to prove the concept and there
03:35:01.28 --> 03:35:05.36 is people down there so we bagged ass can't get everyone up right there now everyone's hearing
03:35:05.36 --> 03:35:12.16 about this like water mission going down and the night we were supposed to go and execute we
03:35:12.16 --> 03:35:19.36 never did do it and two hours before we left I was switched out with Josh Harris who drowned and died
03:35:20.64 --> 03:35:25.44 and I was right next to him yeah so there's a lot of little details in there I'll leave out but
03:35:25.44 --> 03:35:34.32 it was a bad deal yeah and you know that experience had an impact on me for sure and so when I
03:35:34.32 --> 03:35:40.80 did the Iron Man in 2012 one of the reasons why I did the Iron Man was because as a free diver I
03:35:40.80 --> 03:35:45.92 got into serious freediving like serious I've been as well a Mexico a do all over the world that's
03:35:45.92 --> 03:35:50.32 why you were in the team's year during that when I was contracting and but I started freediving
03:35:50.32 --> 03:35:55.92 in the teams uh matter fact I came over this whole thing called spear fishing PT because we had
03:35:55.92 --> 03:36:01.28 surf PT and I was like that's not fair it's discriminating like we should have spear fishing PT
03:36:02.24 --> 03:36:05.52 which was like greatest thing because we never got back to work on time there was always some kind
03:36:05.52 --> 03:36:12.96 of issue and so we got the day off basically I know that that only lasted for like three weeks
03:36:14.000 --> 03:36:19.84 but yeah so I I had to fell even diving around the world like I mean I was going to very deep
03:36:19.84 --> 03:36:25.76 dust you know 110 feet like killing you know tune on panaman then I spent you know three weeks
03:36:25.76 --> 03:36:31.36 and then as well a diving I always had this wreck playing in my head of what had happened when I
03:36:31.36 --> 03:36:36.16 would get in situations I got my arm caught Venezuela underneath the rock at 80 feet you know
03:36:36.16 --> 03:36:40.16 and the next thing I know it's like in my head like I'm gonna have kids I'm drowning like it was
03:36:40.16 --> 03:36:46.000 crazy I'm like I got to kick this thing so I ended up like signing up for the Iron Man because I
03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:52.56 heard like the the swim is the most terrifying thing in the world which it was no good yeah I had like
03:36:52.56 --> 03:36:58.48 a pain it's a bold statement coming from that freaking afghanist is you want a bunch of like
03:36:58.48 --> 03:37:03.52 middle-aged men and women that are like you know hate their lives and trying to find themselves
03:37:03.52 --> 03:37:09.60 like you don't want to be in the water with them because they're vicious and but anyway like I'm
03:37:09.60 --> 03:37:15.20 out there and I'll never forget it like I'm a fast swimmer I I was like finished I think 112 on the
03:37:15.20 --> 03:37:22.80 swim and Iron Man which is is really good 2.4 miles and I'm out there and I started too far
03:37:22.80 --> 03:37:27.28 and advanced for my skill and then people started swimming over top of me like I was just a
03:37:27.28 --> 03:37:31.84 random boolee I mean they literally just kicked me in the face and just there was 2400 people just like
03:37:31.84 --> 03:37:37.12 swimming and I couldn't catch my breath and I got kicked in the face my goggles got kicked off and
03:37:37.12 --> 03:37:41.36 I had like I don't like I got like guys like I like the prepatabors like you need help you know like
03:37:41.36 --> 03:37:44.32 it raises over like I'm like I can't breathe I can't breathe I can't breathe I'm like oh my god I'm
03:37:44.32 --> 03:37:50.08 back and I remember this guy was like I'm never forget it he looks at me he's an a panic like me
03:37:50.72 --> 03:37:55.60 and I'm like not panicking panicking but I'm just like I can't catch my breath because every time
03:37:55.60 --> 03:38:02.88 I try to breathe I get some like you know 45 year old ladies foot toe up my nose and so he grabs
03:38:02.88 --> 03:38:07.44 on me and he's holding on to me and I'm at this buoy and I remember he's pushing me down and
03:38:07.44 --> 03:38:12.72 I got him and the paddleboards are trying to get in and I'm like in this mix and I remember I
03:38:12.72 --> 03:38:19.76 just looked at him and I was just like in that moment I like faced it and this dude was like pulling
03:38:19.76 --> 03:38:23.84 me down and I just like grabbed him by his rubber cap and I punched him between the shoulder
03:38:23.84 --> 03:38:28.88 blades as hard as I could and he was just like just like like electric shock like hit him and I was
03:38:28.88 --> 03:38:35.20 like I just like I just started like swimming and my wife has this great shot of me coming out I
03:38:35.20 --> 03:38:39.60 look like I look like I have like PTSD when I'm coming out of the water like my I have like
03:38:39.60 --> 03:38:45.84 bags of my eyes I got news for you you did yeah I came out of the water and I was like I was
03:38:45.84 --> 03:38:54.48 like totally terrified and but I never had another about what that ever got and it was a moment
03:38:54.48 --> 03:38:59.36 where I was like I knew I had like I had like finally like face that thing down which was like playing
03:38:59.36 --> 03:39:04.24 in the back of my head it was really weird when I would get into water situations or be in
03:39:04.24 --> 03:39:11.60 drowning which happened a lot like in free dive spear fishing you know and so I never had another
03:39:11.60 --> 03:39:18.56 another other issue again so it was a it was a moment of my life and I will never forget as long
03:39:18.56 --> 03:39:25.76 as I live we go offline I'll tell you somewhere details and then what what are you going on right now
03:39:25.76 --> 03:39:32.72 like with the the beef the ranch the cows like you're full on just going for it yeah I mean
03:39:32.72 --> 03:39:38.16 I just I mean my goal is so we just purchased this ranch we got a capital campaign going on
03:39:38.16 --> 03:39:43.44 and we've raised some money building a human development center there so which will be it's a 10
03:39:43.44 --> 03:39:50.80 person coal plunge a 10 person sauna a jam in the center and then a meditation room that's sound
03:39:50.80 --> 03:39:56.40 proof and then it vibrates at 520 it made the megahertz of the earth so it's very good grounding
03:39:57.44 --> 03:40:04.32 and when something's vibrating 525 megahertz do you hear it you feel it or it's not it's the earth
03:40:04.32 --> 03:40:09.84 so like if you ever if you know I always tell people like if you're having like anxiety or something
03:40:09.84 --> 03:40:13.36 like that like or you're just like you know sometimes you get that kind of like raciness or you
03:40:13.36 --> 03:40:17.92 feel like you got to like down regulate a little bit like the best thing you can go out is go outside
03:40:17.92 --> 03:40:22.56 take your shoes off stand in the ground being total silence and stand there and it usually goes away
03:40:22.56 --> 03:40:28.08 from like three to four minutes and I just breathe it's very grounding it it's very it grounds you
03:40:28.08 --> 03:40:32.32 and so you know frequencies are super important so we actually do sound with the guys and
03:40:32.32 --> 03:40:37.52 last of the guy said it was our first year doing it almost every guy said it was the most
03:40:37.52 --> 03:40:42.40 profound experience of their life we have somebody that comes in and brings those sound bowls
03:40:42.40 --> 03:40:47.44 and they bring up the resonance outside on the ranch like deep where the sweat lodges and it just
03:40:47.44 --> 03:40:53.92 vibrates it and they do these bowls and it's like whoa so some people it's so intense they vomit
03:40:53.92 --> 03:40:58.88 from it so wait you sit you lay there and these are big bowls I don't know what you're talking
03:40:58.88 --> 03:41:03.28 about yeah they're bowls and they stir them and they put the each bowl produces a frequency and
03:41:03.28 --> 03:41:09.60 they can bring you up to the resonance which ground it grounds you and so you know obviously like
03:41:09.60 --> 03:41:14.48 everything is frequency and everything is is like how are you looking at somebody on their iPhone
03:41:15.36 --> 03:41:19.68 they're like how am I talking to you how am I vibrating right now and you are somehow interpreting
03:41:19.68 --> 03:41:25.20 what I'm saying to your brain I'm literally vibrating to you and somehow you're like yeah
03:41:25.20 --> 03:41:32.64 let's go do something right go over here like and so you know that's that's that sound therapy
03:41:32.64 --> 03:41:37.52 is something that it works it's very very powerful if you've you've never tried it there's
03:41:37.52 --> 03:41:41.52 probably places here go go to a sound bath they have all these bowls all these things they'll
03:41:41.52 --> 03:41:46.72 bring you in there and because your whole life is inundated with blue light and frequencies and
03:41:46.72 --> 03:41:51.04 what Wi-Fi signals and all those kind of things so what you're doing is you're reestablishing a baseline
03:41:51.04 --> 03:41:56.56 so so yeah so the ranch we're building the human development center we got an arena going up
03:41:56.56 --> 03:42:02.56 100 by 200 indoor arena so we can expand kind of into the winter time and then the guys live in
03:42:02.56 --> 03:42:09.20 non-electric wood cabins without door showers and an outhouse total minimalist so
03:42:09.20 --> 03:42:13.68 brings in the guys the students the students are going through yeah are going through so they
03:42:13.68 --> 03:42:18.48 do live in like little lodgepole cabins that were building that are just little bunks a little wood
03:42:18.48 --> 03:42:25.92 stove and an outdoor shower and an outhouse a double outhouse good get some about yeah get some yeah
03:42:25.92 --> 03:42:29.84 I'm our fact this year when we put the double outhouse that we forgot to put the little blanket in the
03:42:29.84 --> 03:42:33.60 center three days later the guys like hey do you know like a blanket or something I was like
03:42:33.60 --> 03:42:38.48 I'm sorry I totally forgot about that but they were using it yeah which is the survey that's one
03:42:38.48 --> 03:42:44.000 of those things that's one of the like starkest memories I have from navy blue camp was that there's
03:42:44.000 --> 03:42:48.64 no stalls in the shitters and you were just literally sitting down and there was someone sitting next to
03:42:48.64 --> 03:42:55.28 you you know a photo away taking a shit next to you it's just the removal of whatever it's kind
03:42:55.28 --> 03:43:00.24 of the removal of all privacy is gone yeah it's gone yeah it's got a hundred percent yeah
03:43:00.24 --> 03:43:06.000 poop next to you that's how much we only move in that whole next to that other dude
03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:10.16 different than before and by the way there's another dude on the other side of you that's also
03:43:10.16 --> 03:43:16.24 shitty so that's good times so you're so you're building this so this is gonna up our capacity
03:43:16.24 --> 03:43:20.40 to take more students do more yeah because right now I mean the guys are living in wall tents
03:43:21.36 --> 03:43:24.96 and everything's out all the outdoor showers all that kind of stuff the ranch we bought has
03:43:24.96 --> 03:43:30.16 basically a tiny little cabin on it that you know Abraham Lincoln's contractor bill and two
03:43:30.16 --> 03:43:36.16 pivot you know and and a small shop that had no well or anything so we popped in a well we've done
03:43:36.16 --> 03:43:40.88 all this stuff and so now we're raising money to to build that out and to expand the program
03:43:40.88 --> 03:43:46.64 to year round and you know my goal is not to have some big giant program like I think that is
03:43:46.64 --> 03:43:51.84 the problem is that everybody thinks there's like one institution that can do it all and
03:43:52.64 --> 03:43:58.80 my idea is to kind of get to a sweet spot with guys and then you know we're capturing data
03:43:58.80 --> 03:44:03.60 and then to go and to get other organizations to uplevel themselves and to begin to really
03:44:03.60 --> 03:44:08.64 start thinking about like human development and bringing forth change rather than like me saying
03:44:08.64 --> 03:44:13.04 like I can do it all and I can build this huge thing and I want to I want to network with people
03:44:13.04 --> 03:44:17.60 and have them scale up and that people that are really serious about human development and I think
03:44:17.60 --> 03:44:24.08 that will I think we'll look back in this will be a hub of you know it'll be a place where
03:44:24.08 --> 03:44:28.72 a spark formed and when people start looking at things different because the guys that graduate
03:44:28.72 --> 03:44:37.68 this program you know it's a they're they're they're they're different they're changed you know what I mean
03:44:37.68 --> 03:44:43.20 and and so I think that everybody deserves that opportunity but I can't do it all and I think that
03:44:43.20 --> 03:44:48.96 other people like I said there's 50,000 nonprofits in North America you know we spent 92 billion
03:44:48.96 --> 03:44:56.88 dollars since 2012 in the end of 2020 and it's gotten worse you know and I'm sorry and a lot of people
03:44:56.88 --> 03:45:02.72 like you know I hate me because I say you know you got organizations they got shatlin ponies
03:45:02.72 --> 03:45:09.36 that you can take and they put sneakers on them and you walk around town like my message is
03:45:10.32 --> 03:45:16.16 you know fuck you like that is that does it that does it do anything like it takes time and it
03:45:16.16 --> 03:45:21.28 takes commitment and maybe that's not for everybody and you'll have to walk your own path but I think
03:45:21.28 --> 03:45:26.72 that as all these existing institutions maybe I can find 10 maybe I can find 10 that are
03:45:26.72 --> 03:45:31.60 focused on human development maybe maybe it's saying like hey think about the change of a guy you
03:45:31.60 --> 03:45:36.48 take a guy's 75 pounds over ways on meds he's like but he wants to change and he's got the fire and
03:45:36.48 --> 03:45:41.52 you put him in a 10 week fight camp right and then think about who that guy would be at the end of
03:45:41.52 --> 03:45:47.84 10 weeks right nutrition diet focus meditation ice bass like working out purpose like feeling
03:45:47.84 --> 03:45:53.44 good it's you're all like getting balance all those things like I mean it's it's simple
03:45:53.44 --> 03:46:02.80 but it's it's it takes effort and it takes work and so my my goal is to is to start a new conversation
03:46:02.80 --> 03:46:09.52 and bring people together about what it you know about restoring you know these guys back to the
03:46:09.52 --> 03:46:17.92 dignity of who they are it's crazy like the shit's not gonna be easy if you're gonna reset your life
03:46:17.92 --> 03:46:24.24 and dig in and find out who you are that's not gonna that's not gonna be an easy evolution
03:46:24.24 --> 03:46:29.44 no don't it's like yeah it's like yeah and it's crazy you know that that opening that
03:46:29.44 --> 03:46:35.36 read for me was like literally there are some people that are literally trying to give you a magic
03:46:35.36 --> 03:46:42.16 pill that's gonna do all this work for you like which is a crazy thing it's crazy it's insane
03:46:42.16 --> 03:46:47.28 like when you think about it but the thing is we already know the secrets of it right that's why
03:46:47.28 --> 03:46:51.60 you know the business people are like hmm let's create something called obstacle course races
03:46:51.60 --> 03:46:56.96 right like you literally climb over a log flop into the mud then some roi did out dude
03:46:56.96 --> 03:47:00.96 hit to ahead with a phone bat and then you get like a metal and then the next day in the office
03:47:00.96 --> 03:47:08.72 everyone's like whoa what's dipping about him he faced an obstacle gym and he overcame right
03:47:08.72 --> 03:47:15.28 I mean that is the asset obstacle course races like I mean we so so set that challenge in front of
03:47:15.28 --> 03:47:20.24 yourself I think we can like unite together dude different for me like I never thought you know
03:47:20.24 --> 03:47:27.28 we bought a ranch for three million bucks I met this guy he was delivering hey I started talking
03:47:27.28 --> 03:47:30.48 to me he goes oh my dad might be selling his ranch you should meet him are you looking for
03:47:30.48 --> 03:47:34.80 a ranch I'm like sure yeah definitely we worked we were seven years with no ranch
03:47:34.80 --> 03:47:40.40 at least everything set it up every year mobile gypsy camp it was a living hell imagine 70 horses
03:47:40.40 --> 03:47:47.12 not owning 16th of an acre was a nightmare and most people never saw that and so here I am like
03:47:47.12 --> 03:47:52.16 going to this guy's place I sit down a cup of coffee you know big business guy I sit down I'm like
03:47:52.16 --> 03:47:57.52 he's like so he interested in the ranch like yeah he's like well to have any money I'm like no
03:47:57.52 --> 03:48:03.28 no thanks for coming like basically it was like really nice but then never talked to me again
03:48:04.000 --> 03:48:07.52 so then like a year later he calls me up he's like I'm definitely gonna sell the ranch
03:48:07.52 --> 03:48:11.76 are you interested and I was like absolutely so I ride down there my mortar cycle and I'm like
03:48:11.76 --> 03:48:16.40 I sit down with him he pours me a cup of coffee goes do you have any money and I'm like
03:48:17.68 --> 03:48:22.80 no but I'm gonna get it because it was like it was like the jerk store with like you know
03:48:22.80 --> 03:48:28.40 with George just adds it I was like thought of this this come back like the whole year and he's like
03:48:28.40 --> 03:48:36.24 well I said I'll give you my word give me an opportunity and I'll get it and I didn't have any
03:48:36.24 --> 03:48:40.96 of that kind of resources so ended up getting alone what was that that was last year so you
03:48:40.96 --> 03:48:46.000 got the wrong against a charity yeah we got loan yeah we got loan on the ranch and so
03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:51.68 and I raised a million five from various donors and put that you know down payment whenever took a
03:48:51.68 --> 03:48:56.08 loan out and you know and we just launched a four year capital campaign to build a ranch out so
03:48:56.08 --> 03:49:02.88 some 7.5 million bucks over four years and and then you know the funny thing is about non-profits
03:49:02.88 --> 03:49:08.16 is that at own it I'm basically even though I'm the founder I'm just an employee I'll never have
03:49:08.16 --> 03:49:11.84 those assets like if the whole thing dissolved tomorrow goes to either the state or to another
03:49:11.84 --> 03:49:19.84 nonprofit and so you know I exist in this solely for the development and betterment of my fellow
03:49:19.84 --> 03:49:26.000 man and I think that you know whether it's a veteran or it's a stay-at-home or somebody recovering
03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:32.08 from a get ran over by a dumb truck or whatever it is I think that people are gonna once again
03:49:32.08 --> 03:49:39.04 begin looking to to partake in that heroes journey and that journey of self-discovery to get out of the
03:49:39.04 --> 03:49:45.36 places that they're currently in and so that's that's my goal and we're capturing data we're
03:49:45.36 --> 03:49:49.76 working with the university to get results and stuff like that so that I can go to other non-profits
03:49:49.76 --> 03:49:55.52 and sit down with that person say listen I know you give $5,000 to critically injured soldiers
03:49:55.52 --> 03:50:00.40 I also know that you have $290 million in the bank because your financials are public and online
03:50:00.40 --> 03:50:06.48 as a nonprofit maybe you could run a program that actually does something for people beyond
03:50:08.24 --> 03:50:13.76 getting on their kids' iPads maybe we can do something to a better mankind you know maybe we can do
03:50:13.76 --> 03:50:21.60 something to level up you know society our society our community in a way and and stop giving
03:50:21.60 --> 03:50:30.64 handouts and start you know giving hand-ups you know I think that handouts are a total failure I think
03:50:30.64 --> 03:50:34.16 yeah of course people have things and stuff like that you know critical things but like for the most
03:50:34.16 --> 03:50:40.16 part like you have to own it you have to earn it and you have to own it and I think we get in the
03:50:40.16 --> 03:50:46.32 opportunity business and we get out of the handout business oh you served come on and float into
03:50:46.32 --> 03:50:51.92 tube and we have a massage therapist online thank you for your Air Force time oh here's a
03:50:51.92 --> 03:50:58.08 flame and yon and a care and a raspberry like you know then a jacket and some fishing here even
03:50:58.08 --> 03:51:02.24 though you live in Detroit and you live in one bedroom apartment and you live below the poverty line
03:51:02.24 --> 03:51:08.96 like most veterans do and and maybe I'm going to give you an opportunity to change your own life
03:51:08.96 --> 03:51:14.24 but you're going to have to do the work and we get back in the opportunity business that's
03:51:14.24 --> 03:51:20.16 what I want to see happen and then hopefully you know you know in the meteorite hits the world
03:51:20.16 --> 03:51:24.96 and dinosaurs come back or everything like that it'll be like a plaque somewhere and I was like
03:51:24.96 --> 03:51:31.68 he tried to do good but it was futile they destroyed themselves aren't you aren't you trying to
03:51:32.64 --> 03:51:39.60 do something with with beef too like yeah so we're going with that yeah so so the beef model is kind
03:51:39.60 --> 03:51:45.20 of like so I I talked about the social hybrid is this nonprofits are in this perpetual
03:51:45.20 --> 03:51:50.24 starvation cycle right where you're beholden to the donors where you know you have to raise money
03:51:50.24 --> 03:51:53.76 and then you know you're constantly in this state of having to raise money because you can't
03:51:53.76 --> 03:51:57.92 generate money because you're a non-profit I didn't know that by the name when I started
03:51:57.92 --> 03:52:04.40 like why am I so broke and then like five years later I'm like wait a second non-profit
03:52:04.40 --> 03:52:13.12 and damn it so but I was like we have this ranch you know we're going to start a cattle company
03:52:13.12 --> 03:52:18.24 farm to table you know and I think that like the care of the animal from the moment it's born
03:52:18.24 --> 03:52:23.52 living and dying on the ranch treating the animal with respect you know if you've ever been
03:52:23.52 --> 03:52:28.16 to mass agriculture and you saw what it's really about it's one of the most disturbing things
03:52:28.16 --> 03:52:31.76 that you've ever seen in your life and if you've ever been to a slaughterhouse or packing plan
03:52:31.76 --> 03:52:35.68 where they're doing a thousand head a day you know they're picking them up with skid stairs and
03:52:35.68 --> 03:52:45.12 terrified adrenaline hormones like smat ages very it's not good and I think that I think that
03:52:45.12 --> 03:52:49.28 carries over to the food and so like you know raising that animal honoring that animal letting
03:52:49.28 --> 03:52:53.36 them graze letting them live letting them be out there letting them live their lives sustainably
03:52:53.36 --> 03:52:58.96 harvesting them teaching people how to do that you know integrating that and then selling that beef
03:52:58.96 --> 03:53:04.80 to donors that can then in turn support the program so the ranch stands on its own to legs so
03:53:04.80 --> 03:53:09.52 it's a social high bread it won't exist to make money but it will exist to sustain you know the
03:53:09.52 --> 03:53:14.16 program then also expose people to that animal husbandry into that ranching side of the house and then
03:53:14.16 --> 03:53:21.28 also you know down along with the beef I I think like to me food like where your food comes from
03:53:21.28 --> 03:53:26.96 is so important and it's so critical to the wellness of the individual you can expect to be happy if you're
03:53:26.96 --> 03:53:33.60 eating you know cheeses and garbage and all those kind it all is tied together your body is the
03:53:33.60 --> 03:53:39.28 subconscious mind and even down to the food that you eat and you know what I started getting exposed
03:53:39.28 --> 03:53:44.56 to this world and I started seeing things I was like man this is like rough like when you really
03:53:44.56 --> 03:53:48.96 see what's happening put to the animals and those kind of things and listen I'm not like you know
03:53:48.96 --> 03:53:53.44 out there like you know whatever like an activist or anything like that but I'm like there's a
03:53:53.44 --> 03:53:58.24 better way like the natives did it right you know they they harvested they took what they wanted
03:53:58.24 --> 03:54:02.16 they they used every component of the you know think about the waste that we have the only
03:54:02.16 --> 03:54:06.80 take the best cuts everything's dog food or this or that like and so for me it's like but
03:54:06.80 --> 03:54:11.20 you're in the whole animal using the bones to create bone broth taking the hides and making
03:54:11.20 --> 03:54:16.96 boxing gloves and and American made boxing gloves with the hides and like taking all the fat
03:54:16.96 --> 03:54:22.16 taking all those things taking the bones making biochar out of them right so like using that as a
03:54:22.16 --> 03:54:26.64 organic fertilizer that we could use on the ranch and we could give away and share with other
03:54:26.64 --> 03:54:31.28 people like using the whole animal and teaching guys those things because when they become connected
03:54:31.28 --> 03:54:37.12 to their food they start to understand the system that they're a part of you know I tell people
03:54:37.12 --> 03:54:45.28 the whole world is like your life is held together by a wire okay a wire so like if the wire breaks
03:54:45.28 --> 03:54:53.68 meaning like the power goes out millions will die within weeks from a wire like oh I'll hunt you're
03:54:53.68 --> 03:54:58.40 not gonna hunt you're not gonna make it out of your high rise you're gonna like you'll be in a
03:54:58.40 --> 03:55:06.08 25 million dollar tomb okay the water comes out what are you gonna do it's over a cable a cable
03:55:06.08 --> 03:55:12.24 breaks the internet goes out and millions die and I think that so many guys like common they
03:55:12.24 --> 03:55:16.72 realize and they change their whole lives because they start to realize the role that we pay in the
03:55:16.72 --> 03:55:23.44 system and how you know how everything is now handed to you and you take for granted all those
03:55:23.44 --> 03:55:30.96 aspects and so my goal is to stand up that that system and that human development program and then
03:55:30.96 --> 03:55:35.76 begin to get other people to do the same thing and I want to expand a community you know and
03:55:35.76 --> 03:55:42.56 that's my goal so that's what's going on with the beef and just I mean I talk a lot well and not a lot
03:55:42.56 --> 03:55:49.76 I talk about China China yeah China and you know we saw a lot of this during COVID
03:55:49.76 --> 03:55:55.28 like where do we depend and on but we're dependent on China food and a lot of people don't
03:55:55.28 --> 03:56:04.56 recognize that China let me China China is coming for us I tell people I'm like if you look at
03:56:04.56 --> 03:56:10.48 Mao during the Chinese industrial revolution the Great Leap Forward Mao knew that he needed
03:56:10.48 --> 03:56:15.84 nuclear technology there's been five emperors in China emperors you want that's what I'll call
03:56:15.84 --> 03:56:23.52 dictators whatever leaders great ones whatever dragonlords so like microcrash and so
03:56:24.24 --> 03:56:29.12 but if you look at what they did he understood that they needed nuclear technology so what do
03:56:29.12 --> 03:56:35.52 do he traded food to the Russians and exchange for nuclear technology star-dismone people 30
03:56:35.52 --> 03:56:41.60 million people died during peacetime and he got the nuclear weapon they have a 5,000 year plan
03:56:42.16 --> 03:56:49.76 all right they understand that by by enslaving their own people for cheap labor because Americans
03:56:49.76 --> 03:56:57.60 exist for consumption I want it now and I want to cheap and you know it's like my house I go in there
03:56:57.60 --> 03:57:03.44 how many how much shit do I need right it's cheap it's only three bucks another potato dealer
03:57:04.24 --> 03:57:11.20 you never know so so so so chop me potato peelers did you actually have five I did have five
03:57:11.20 --> 03:57:18.96 so I did have I kept two shout out to queez and art but I I was like if you look at them they're
03:57:18.96 --> 03:57:23.36 smart because what they did is they understood the American psychology they understand that Americans
03:57:23.36 --> 03:57:29.28 are overconfident because from childhood they're told you're the best you're good you get praise
03:57:29.28 --> 03:57:35.28 for things you never deserved they're entitled and lazy Chinese are the opposite right
03:57:35.28 --> 03:57:42.48 so they're like marching forward to their 5,000 year destiny and so what are we do we outsource
03:57:42.48 --> 03:57:49.28 everything to them for super cheap goods and in turn handcuff ourselves to them right including our
03:57:49.28 --> 03:57:55.36 medications the world's most critical medications are men trying and so you know China is on the move
03:57:55.36 --> 03:57:59.76 and their military is now expeditionary they're providing aid to foreign countries they've
03:57:59.76 --> 03:58:04.32 got their jets and let me they got hypersonic missiles and let me tell you something they're not
03:58:04.32 --> 03:58:11.52 over here like trying to pass the PT test okay oh didn't you know gotta go to FAP because I didn't
03:58:11.52 --> 03:58:17.04 make it by the way my rights matter you don't tow the line in the Chinese army you wind up as
03:58:17.04 --> 03:58:24.16 biochar okay they don't know need for you and and GZing Ping said that you know if we try to
03:58:24.16 --> 03:58:27.92 stand against the China this is two months ago and a live speech he said on their show of force
03:58:27.92 --> 03:58:34.88 and he said you will meet a great wall of steel made by 1.8 billion Chinese that are unified
03:58:35.52 --> 03:58:41.28 what are we over here like don't go over here like I don't like you like so they banned all
03:58:41.28 --> 03:58:48.16 girly men on TV there is no boy bands allowed social media turns off at 10 o'clock at night
03:58:48.80 --> 03:58:54.40 and and what are they preparing for to be a world leader and who are they in lock
03:58:54.40 --> 03:58:59.68 stuff with the Russians right and and because they see the United States to wind the link
03:58:59.68 --> 03:59:07.68 because consumption consumerism entitlement over confidence and and and this desire to tell
03:59:07.68 --> 03:59:13.76 people what's right and wrong you know like we have these things on the what happened in Afghanistan
03:59:13.76 --> 03:59:19.92 right we're no longer a force for good we aren't we better rethink because this enemy is not like
03:59:19.92 --> 03:59:25.76 an Afghani running around in pajamas these dudes are probably genetically modified who knows what
03:59:25.76 --> 03:59:30.96 they're gonna do they might unzip their fake Chinese bodies and come out and just be like who knows
03:59:30.96 --> 03:59:35.84 right we they are genetically modifying super soldiers for just that or was it a time or whatever
03:59:35.84 --> 03:59:42.40 just had a thing on them so we are facing a time right now where this entitlement and all these
03:59:42.40 --> 03:59:49.60 things that we have are coming home to roost on us and you know buyer beware because if the cable
03:59:49.60 --> 03:59:56.24 breaks if the earth even burps okay if it just rumbles in the wrong place and the power goes out
03:59:56.24 --> 04:00:04.80 for say two months millions upon there won't be enough excavators to dig the holes for the bodies
04:00:04.80 --> 04:00:13.60 that will burn people because oh no but it's the truth think about it if you're living in a 25
04:00:13.60 --> 04:00:21.36 million dollar high rise on the 98th floor and the power goes out where do you get your next sandwich
04:00:21.36 --> 04:00:26.88 from by time you make it down every store will be gone now the food will be gone there will be
04:00:26.88 --> 04:00:33.68 no water your well pumps won't just think about it life is held together by a cable and we never
04:00:33.68 --> 04:00:37.76 think that that cable is going to ever break and you know who's holding part of that cable
04:00:38.56 --> 04:00:44.88 network is China and I don't think that China would have picked a fight with us but I think we've
04:00:44.88 --> 04:00:49.92 picked a fight with them and because here we are just bloating bloating bloating bloating bloating
04:00:50.88 --> 04:00:58.48 and and and they're refining refining refining refining refining so I mean if if put in a
04:00:58.48 --> 04:01:04.08 vase you crane I bet you I bet you you see China China go after Taiwan simultaneously I wouldn't be
04:01:04.08 --> 04:01:09.36 surprised and and they could launch hypersonic missiles and vaporize our fleet in two seconds and then
04:01:09.36 --> 04:01:16.96 it's either go nuclear or stand down I think I don't know what's what's today just for reference
04:01:16.96 --> 04:01:24.72 today is the 24th of January nice I think that bootens going in I think you crints I think it's on
04:01:24.72 --> 04:01:29.60 and I think it's what he's doing he's looking at Biden who's compromised and he is
04:01:32.000 --> 04:01:37.84 it breaks it breaks my heart and Russia is a bonepic because think about it we Eisenhower screwed them
04:01:37.84 --> 04:01:43.12 over because we're supposed to pay them all that money and we never did and then we chased them over to
04:01:43.12 --> 04:01:48.48 right over to Afghanistan you know cause problems over there walked on them over there did the
04:01:48.48 --> 04:01:54.32 cold war ripped the walls down with crushed her economy did all these things right and now we're telling
04:01:54.32 --> 04:02:00.000 them oh you can't go across those borders and they're just like meanwhile the Russians are over there
04:02:00.000 --> 04:02:07.12 like every guy is like kabib yeah there's a like kill kill kill kill kill how guys are over here like
04:02:07.12 --> 04:02:14.80 stand down people are being mean we're they're gonna call us back oh yeah not all Americans are
04:02:14.80 --> 04:02:18.40 like that there's definitely too many of that I mean there's definitely plenty of Americans I
04:02:18.40 --> 04:02:24.08 were I work with a lot of young military folks and man they are yeah there's kids ready to rock and roll
04:02:24.96 --> 04:02:29.60 but I don't know if the country is I'm if the country's willing to sacrifice like in those
04:02:29.60 --> 04:02:35.52 situations our guts are ripped out I mean think about 20 year war you think you think about like the
04:02:35.52 --> 04:02:40.08 United States there was a USA article last year it's it's worth checking out even though they're kind of
04:02:40.08 --> 04:02:47.12 like whatever but like they have a article with a moving map on it called the cost of war
04:02:47.12 --> 04:02:53.76 if you go if you look it up or Dr. Gore whatever brave it and you will see a moving map and it
04:02:53.76 --> 04:03:01.04 shows last year the United States you know wedged war in 88 countries okay so we we had we had an 88
04:03:01.04 --> 04:03:06.56 so we're getting look at the British Empire they got so spread so thin and so many places
04:03:06.56 --> 04:03:11.44 right and they got so worn down there face and conflicts in Turkey and the conflicts in India and
04:03:11.44 --> 04:03:17.12 conflict next thing you know America you got George Washington's like gonna kill you right and
04:03:17.84 --> 04:03:24.88 and so America's become super extended and I think we need to restore what it means to be an American
04:03:24.88 --> 04:03:30.80 like I think we've lost I think that term is synonymous with the wrong things and and being a
04:03:30.80 --> 04:03:35.68 patriotists synonymous with the wrong things you think patriotic like dude riding a jacked upside
04:03:35.68 --> 04:03:43.36 by side like woo like oh like freedom like no there is no freedom there's only free and that's
04:03:43.36 --> 04:03:48.80 what America freedom means that someone's affording me that to me free is an alienable right
04:03:48.80 --> 04:03:55.28 is is to live like as I see fit and fulfill my purpose and this nation affords me that and
04:03:55.28 --> 04:03:59.04 in turn I serve you know my country that gives me the opportunity and provides all this
04:03:59.04 --> 04:04:02.48 infrastructure and all those kinds of things we take all that for granted and we need to restore
04:04:02.48 --> 04:04:07.60 the message of what it means to be an American I don't care what political parties and
04:04:07.60 --> 04:04:12.40 what color and your race and gender I don't care about any of those things what it is is a common
04:04:12.40 --> 04:04:16.32 thread that made this nation incredibly great and we've taken it for granted and it's starting to get
04:04:16.32 --> 04:04:24.16 afraid and what happens is is that it's like Lenin said you give them a rope and let them
04:04:24.16 --> 04:04:29.20 pull it around their neck and they'll hang in themselves matter fact they sold us the rope
04:04:29.20 --> 04:04:34.32 and we put it around our necks and so I hope I hope we can change I hope the noise can
04:04:34.32 --> 04:04:40.64 quiet down because if people got serious just you change the world by changing yourself that's
04:04:40.64 --> 04:04:44.56 the thing there's not these big grandiose ideas where I get out there and I'm like have the
04:04:44.56 --> 04:04:51.44 huge idea the idea is that I'm the really macro scale I change myself and when I change myself I
04:04:51.44 --> 04:04:56.000 change the things around me and when the people around me change themselves the things around me change
04:04:56.000 --> 04:05:04.48 and that's how mass change happens it happens inversely as well and so you know change for the
04:05:04.48 --> 04:05:09.36 negative and I think like to restore what it means to be American to be able to walk down the street
04:05:09.36 --> 04:05:16.24 and be able to grab somebody about a hand to be united to to restore it kind of that that viewpoint
04:05:16.24 --> 04:05:23.84 of what's made us so great is is the is is the common thread that runs through the hearts of
04:05:23.84 --> 04:05:30.40 every single one of us and and we have to put all those things aside all these projections aside
04:05:30.40 --> 04:05:36.08 and get back to the basics of what it means to be a human and I think that we can come back from this
04:05:36.08 --> 04:05:48.56 do I think we will I don't know um I don't know but if we don't um it will happen to us
04:05:48.56 --> 04:05:54.32 and uh and it will be more swift and more violent it would could ever imagine whether it comes
04:05:54.32 --> 04:06:01.84 from the planet or whether it comes from another nation um the time to change is now is right now
04:06:01.84 --> 04:06:10.48 and and and to readjust so yeah and like you just said all that starts with you yeah
04:06:11.12 --> 04:06:18.32 whoever you are you if you're listening to this right now it's you change and don't be afraid to
04:06:18.32 --> 04:06:25.60 change you know we're so attached to these outcomes like don't be afraid to change and uh um yeah
04:06:25.60 --> 04:06:32.24 I just like I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I see it in the world and I see people like I like today on the
04:06:32.24 --> 04:06:39.68 bus I saw these people and like man we are so disconnected from each shot just trying to walk
04:06:39.68 --> 04:06:47.04 out the door of the bus to the rental car company people are shoving each other just to get out first
04:06:47.04 --> 04:06:55.28 so they could do what the one step in front of the other guy right like that's not who we are as a
04:06:55.28 --> 04:07:00.24 nation that's what makes us different and we got to get we got to get back to those cores core values
04:07:02.80 --> 04:07:08.48 all right this is a long one that's all good man um I want to make sure so you've been mentioning
04:07:08.48 --> 04:07:15.20 your your nonprofit yeah uh horses and heroes heroes and horses but I get it backwards
04:07:15.20 --> 04:07:23.44 it's heroes and horses yeah heroes and horses you go to heroes and horses dot org is in there
04:07:23.44 --> 04:07:32.64 you also have Instagram and Facebook and YouTube channel heroes and horses all of those can be found at the same spot
04:07:33.84 --> 04:07:39.92 echo you got anything I do actually keep so long time ago few hours ago you mentioned something
04:07:39.92 --> 04:07:46.24 about an experience with a black bear and then you just sort of moved on day point I wanted to come back
04:07:46.24 --> 04:07:50.24 I don't want to know what what happened with the black bear let's see where it looks looking
04:07:50.24 --> 04:07:55.76 like you around you right now look you know you know it's really funny about that I've had so many
04:07:55.76 --> 04:08:01.52 runins with bears at this point in the game I look back at that one and it's kind of makes me
04:08:01.52 --> 04:08:07.84 chuckle I mean I've had we had a bear come out horse go off a cliff and get him pale like I mean
04:08:07.84 --> 04:08:13.92 I run into him archery hunting all the time and and now I'm like my black bear story when I was like a
04:08:13.92 --> 04:08:19.12 teenager coming back from my dark years and this black bear like 10th is kind of like if I see a black bear
04:08:19.12 --> 04:08:23.76 literally the back of the jump I'm just like I just pick a stick up I'm like god he's like I like take off
04:08:23.76 --> 04:08:28.80 a grizzly bear is different a grizzly bear is like you feel like you're hunted but
04:08:28.80 --> 04:08:33.68 yeah no what had happened was I was out hiking um I was kind of just like you know here I am
04:08:33.68 --> 04:08:39.76 returning from you know this kind of childhood you know I guess you could say productle son kind of
04:08:39.76 --> 04:08:45.76 experience and I'm up there hiking and a grizzly bear while I'm sleeping out no 10 small black
04:08:45.76 --> 04:08:50.64 bear kind of comes in and he's like literally sniffing around he's all by me and everything and
04:08:50.64 --> 04:08:54.32 I also had was like a Swiss army knife that I'm gotten from my grandfather you'd have the
04:08:54.32 --> 04:09:01.20 kind with a little white toothpick you could pull out and and I have never had it and and I was
04:09:01.20 --> 04:09:06.24 actually very terrified at the time I was like oh my god like here's this thing I'm laying in my sleeping
04:09:06.24 --> 04:09:11.04 bag and he's just kind of sniffing around sniffing around he's walking around and that's what really
04:09:11.04 --> 04:09:15.68 like I started thinking about my life he got my food I didn't have it wrapped up probably it's my food
04:09:15.68 --> 04:09:22.16 and so anyway that experience right there like when I came back I finished my hike with no food
04:09:22.16 --> 04:09:28.72 it was like a three day hike so two nights and three days total and that was on my first night
04:09:28.72 --> 04:09:33.28 and that whole time I reflected on what I want my life to be and so that was a real pivotal moment
04:09:33.28 --> 04:09:39.04 in my life that that little pack bear came in and it made me think about the fragility of my own life
04:09:40.24 --> 04:09:46.24 you know and I'll tell you like there's nothing more that feeling in the wilderness of
04:09:48.000 --> 04:09:55.36 the wilderness is no mercy you know it has only rule and only law it has no mercy that there is no
04:09:55.36 --> 04:10:00.80 quality in nature you know and you feel that when you're around animals and you see them and you're
04:10:00.80 --> 04:10:06.24 with them there's a there's an honesty that happens you know and I discovered that honesty really for
04:10:07.52 --> 04:10:12.16 because I was a lost person you know and I I did feel like I was invincible and so that little
04:10:12.16 --> 04:10:16.88 back bear kind of brought it in made me when my Swiss army knife and maybe feel my own fragility so
04:10:16.88 --> 04:10:22.72 that's what kind of led me to take in the next step to change well I'm gonna ask you I'm just gonna
04:10:22.72 --> 04:10:27.76 ask so what happened with the gris the horse fall off the cliff so I mean I mean I think I
04:10:27.76 --> 04:10:30.48 can ask you now we're gonna stop recording I'm gonna ask you as soon as we get done so you
04:10:30.48 --> 04:10:34.88 know as I tell everybody know as ever it's gonna happen yeah so I was like you know
04:10:34.88 --> 04:10:40.000 it's like my second season packing and you know I got a pack string with me and I'm in the
04:10:40.000 --> 04:10:44.48 back and a grizzly bear kind of comes out on the trail it comes kind of like barreling down
04:10:44.48 --> 04:10:49.44 most of the time the bears will stop kind of like look sometimes they'll stand up and then
04:10:49.44 --> 04:10:53.60 they usually when they see the horses they don't like the horses when you're alone by yourself that
04:10:53.60 --> 04:11:00.96 is a completely different story and one of the guys one of the cowboys was in front of me and he
04:11:01.92 --> 04:11:06.48 thought he was kind of kind of spooked the bear off more which was still kind of going down the trail
04:11:06.48 --> 04:11:12.24 because he dropped down to the next switchback and when he did the the horse spooked when the bear
04:11:12.24 --> 04:11:17.44 moved and he went off the side it was very steep and the horse kind of locked up as hindquarters
04:11:17.44 --> 04:11:23.44 and then took a jump locked up as hindquarters and then there was like one huge like Douglas fur
04:11:23.44 --> 04:11:29.84 with a giant timber or bow sticking out that was like pointed and when the horse leaped you know
04:11:29.84 --> 04:11:36.24 at that kind of steep grade it gained a lot of altitude and it landed directly onto that thing
04:11:36.24 --> 04:11:42.96 and I went through it stomach and out it's side and it made the most horrible noise I've ever heard
04:11:42.96 --> 04:11:49.60 a horse make in my life and it was like like and it was like making this bellowing sound that the
04:11:49.60 --> 04:11:54.24 cowboy flips off peels the head stall off the horse everyone's like screaming like am I gonna
04:11:55.04 --> 04:12:01.36 so I'm like jump off my horse I just leave the mule's loose and I start like kind of trying to get
04:12:01.36 --> 04:12:06.40 down on and the horse is like kicking and blood is like pumping out it's hitting me my face I mean
04:12:06.40 --> 04:12:12.96 it's a large animal and I'm trying to get him up off this thing and the cowboy is kind of
04:12:12.96 --> 04:12:16.48 the heads dazed and he's like there's like I need help getting this horse up we're trying to stop
04:12:16.48 --> 04:12:21.92 the bleeding like and I'm like and then the horse died died like probably like within 10 seconds
04:12:21.92 --> 04:12:31.60 blood out I'm as massive injury and uh where was nothing more healing than that uh yeah so I you know
04:12:31.60 --> 04:12:36.72 that was uh that was an intense experience I've had them um we had some guys we had a guy quit
04:12:38.16 --> 04:12:43.92 three years ago bear came out barreled towards the whole pack string
04:12:45.44 --> 04:12:51.36 the guy that was working for me at the time shot him and tumble them bear turned came out of
04:12:51.36 --> 04:12:56.88 again hit him a second time what was he shooting what was he 57 that's why I carry 44 mag
04:12:56.88 --> 04:13:04.24 and it was a guy who had to attend them more shots and like 44 mag and they're so the bear
04:13:05.28 --> 04:13:09.60 tumbles and of course you got to call the forest service and since like investigation and they
04:13:09.60 --> 04:13:15.76 came up and it was 13 feet uh the shot was made 13 feet the bear print from the horse I use
04:13:15.76 --> 04:13:21.28 about to use about the tackle the animal but most of the times you know they don't really want
04:13:21.28 --> 04:13:26.72 to bother you but you know you never know and the guy that quit was like yeah and I'm good well the
04:13:26.72 --> 04:13:31.84 whole pack string exploded okay so if we hear comes at grizzly bear a dead run and next thing
04:13:31.84 --> 04:13:36.48 you know these guys are five you know they're on day nine on horses their horses start
04:13:36.48 --> 04:13:41.20 bucking and you blow up and the meals are going ever I mean it's like a yard itself this is
04:13:41.20 --> 04:13:46.16 complete freaking mayhem mayhem mayhem mayhem you because like I mean somebody that was more
04:13:46.16 --> 04:13:50.40 skill could have like got a hold of them if you watch that film the 500 mile project
04:13:50.40 --> 04:13:59.04 you know it's it's a great film but we had a guy a mountain bike run into them and the horse
04:13:59.04 --> 04:14:03.84 rid back and broke his orbitals broke his face and and then half of it meant a factor whatever
04:14:03.84 --> 04:14:08.88 but things can get sideways you know with horses like pretty quick and that grizzly bear
04:14:08.88 --> 04:14:14.48 experience was was one of those but doesn't happen often and you know so by the way applied
04:14:14.48 --> 04:14:21.84 to the program totally safe almost totally well well protect you know but it's it's a huge
04:14:21.84 --> 04:14:26.40 opportunity we just opened applications by the way I'll plug that real quick last week so
04:14:27.12 --> 04:14:33.44 they're piling up quick and you know we'll close them I think March 31st and then April 1st
04:14:33.44 --> 04:14:38.56 we select the class so we're kind of select them along the way and that selection is eight people
04:14:38.56 --> 04:14:44.48 yeah or is it six or three eight man classes and then we'll run everyone across the wall 32 guys go through
04:14:44.48 --> 04:14:50.24 the program this year so yeah so so applications are open nine so go to heroes and horses.org and
04:14:51.36 --> 04:14:55.84 but apply if you're interested in coming out for the experience of your lifetime right on
04:14:55.84 --> 04:15:02.80 and so 357 mag no no good for for bear no it's not I mean I have a 44 mag I'll tell you right now
04:15:02.80 --> 04:15:11.52 I've like I've done so many side cuts by side comparisons with guns like 10 mills 357s I'm telling
04:15:11.52 --> 04:15:15.60 you you want that initial knock down power to be a wake up call and let me tell you when
04:15:15.60 --> 04:15:22.24 a bear runs they put their head down load of the ground they're not like up there's super
04:15:22.24 --> 04:15:26.80 load of the ground and so you know a lot of people don't realize that like they're actually
04:15:26.80 --> 04:15:31.44 difficult to hit because they're like when they're running at you like that you know 30 miles
04:15:31.44 --> 04:15:36.72 an hour they're coming at there's a lot happening very quickly and bears aren't as scared of people
04:15:36.72 --> 04:15:42.80 anymore the scariest thing is when I shoot you know when I knock an elk down and I'm by myself
04:15:42.80 --> 04:15:46.000 and then I got you know hit on the GPS for the guys that read the horses or whatever and I'm out
04:15:46.000 --> 04:15:51.92 there by myself like stand over gut pile that is like the worst feeling. Chum in the water man
04:15:51.92 --> 04:15:56.48 it's the worst feeling like you want to you know I always build a fire and I like make it like
04:15:56.48 --> 04:16:00.48 super big or whatever and I try to put pine bows over and piss on I'm gonna do all these like the
04:16:00.48 --> 04:16:04.32 kind of things or whatever but you want to talk about like getting in your you know I'm doing
04:16:04.32 --> 04:16:09.68 the whole like what's that I'm the only one out there my god there's not like come on to take
04:16:09.68 --> 04:16:13.76 that horses to get to you depends where I'm at you know some long-awaited okay
04:16:13.76 --> 04:16:19.76 you ever slept out on some guts no no no guys come no matter what you're forced to see at night
04:16:20.64 --> 04:16:25.20 I always felt listen we ride at night and it's for I mean things happen I mean there is no
04:16:25.20 --> 04:16:30.64 this what it is you're at a night you want to find out you know he's tell people I said you don't know you know
04:16:30.64 --> 04:16:34.000 a lot of people don't know this a little bit of history but I always tell them that the uh
04:16:34.80 --> 04:16:40.000 maybe I shouldn't say this but the an old cowboy told me one time that the cathode religion was
04:16:40.000 --> 04:16:45.28 actually started in Montana and it was uh it was an old outfit or looking for a tree branches at night
04:16:45.28 --> 04:16:50.80 right so riding the source and I always told that joke to the guys joking around shout out to the
04:16:50.80 --> 04:16:58.16 folks whatever but I I it works like if you ride you can't see anything and you're like
04:16:58.16 --> 04:17:03.20 you know it is the craziest feeling to ride all through the night on a horse it's wild but the horse
04:17:03.20 --> 04:17:08.24 is no what's up oh they see perfect right no but you can't see anything you know and you're
04:17:08.24 --> 04:17:12.000 walking on these like ridges and you just hear like rocks like ding ding ding ding ding
04:17:12.000 --> 04:17:16.88 you're like ah okay you just like you really ride an horse name like ding batter at every like
04:17:16.88 --> 04:17:22.88 I don't know I trust you but they don't want to die either so yeah here is an horse is that or
04:17:22.88 --> 04:17:27.84 I really appreciate the opportunity uh and taking the time you know to kind of hear the story and stuff
04:17:27.84 --> 04:17:33.68 so thank you very much well hey man thanks for coming on you know sharing these lessons
04:17:33.68 --> 04:17:39.20 thanks for your service and in everything that you did and and really man I think thanks for the
04:17:39.20 --> 04:17:45.44 most part what you're doing right now man I think it's awesome and um appreciate it bro all right
04:17:45.44 --> 04:17:54.40 thanks thanks Echo Mikeo just stepped stepped out awesome having him on I just was reviewing my
04:17:54.40 --> 04:18:01.12 notes that I was taking while he was talking and most of them I got to but there's one that I
04:18:01.12 --> 04:18:05.60 didn't get to address and I'm sure maybe come back on at some point we can talk about her we'll
04:18:05.60 --> 04:18:10.96 just talk about it but you remember he told the story or he was he was making hypothetical
04:18:10.96 --> 04:18:19.68 situation Warren Buffett is in the desert he has no water and Micah Sees him and Micah has water
04:18:20.72 --> 04:18:26.96 and Warren Buffett's gonna die and he says you know I'll give you this water but you have to give me
04:18:26.96 --> 04:18:35.60 all of your money and and and Micah says so he's gonna do it right and that's true
04:18:35.60 --> 04:18:48.88 often but here's the crazy thing there are people whose ego will not allow them to make that trade
04:18:48.88 --> 04:18:54.88 they would actually rather die I know that sounds crazy sounds a little bit inconceivable let me
04:18:54.88 --> 04:19:03.28 tell you how it's not inconceivable in what LaFroat about with the with the situation with a
04:19:03.28 --> 04:19:12.24 a special operations unit that was gonna conduct an operation and LaF talk to some
04:19:12.88 --> 04:19:18.16 national guard guys that were saying do not do that operation LaF goes and gives that information
04:19:18.16 --> 04:19:24.56 to the special operations unit that was gonna go do it and those guys were like no we're going
04:19:25.76 --> 04:19:30.64 the national guard guard guys they don't know how to handle it I forget with the exact
04:19:30.64 --> 04:19:36.80 warning but we don't need to listen to them instead we're gonna go do this mission and so we have
04:19:36.80 --> 04:19:43.76 to keep in mind that ego is so strong that if you have a guy now look Warren Buffett might be a guy
04:19:43.76 --> 04:19:48.40 who's you know let us eat these older guy maybe he's got enough life experiences to be like oh
04:19:48.40 --> 04:19:53.52 I want to live that's more important to me but I guarantee there are some individuals that would
04:19:53.52 --> 04:19:59.60 rather die than admit that they're wrong they'd rather die than take help from someone else
04:19:59.60 --> 04:20:08.56 they'd rather die than ask for help so that was just one little thing that I thought about as
04:20:09.92 --> 04:20:14.16 and unfortunately you know I took the note and then I didn't get to get to bring it up with
04:20:14.16 --> 04:20:20.24 with Micah but that is something to think about you don't realize how powerful
04:20:20.24 --> 04:20:29.12 a negative force an ego can be yeah I was thinking the same thing to at that time there's a movie
04:20:30.08 --> 04:20:35.84 like kind of new I think where it had Kevin Spacey in it and then before they released it they replaced
04:20:35.84 --> 04:20:41.36 them because there was Kevin Spacey scandal you know I'm gonna be talking about something about the
04:20:41.36 --> 04:20:45.76 don't want to say the cats beer I don't know I don't know what movie but it was basically
04:20:45.76 --> 04:20:52.08 the famous rich guy when is in the movie or that's the movies about both okay both um it's
04:20:52.08 --> 04:20:56.48 I don't know yeah so it's about a real it's like kind of like a true story or something I think
04:20:56.48 --> 04:21:03.12 if I'm mistaken I'm only getting like piece of it but it's basically about uh this super duper rich guy
04:21:03.92 --> 04:21:09.52 they I want to say they kidnapped his son or something like that the daughter or something
04:21:09.52 --> 04:21:14.40 and they're like hey basically like you know held him for ransom or like give us this money or
04:21:14.40 --> 04:21:20.32 whatever and the guy and he was no money for this guy like he was not that much and he was in the
04:21:20.32 --> 04:21:23.76 I think it was like on the news or something it was like oh so what are you gonna do it was like I don't
04:21:23.76 --> 04:21:30.000 care I don't care like there's no way he would give money it was that it was like that no that much you know
04:21:30.000 --> 04:21:37.28 where yeah I can lose a son like whatever it's like the it's not like and I'm totally trying to
04:21:37.28 --> 04:21:41.68 remember the thing but it wasn't it wasn't like oh I kind of forward it or it wasn't it was
04:21:41.68 --> 04:21:46.72 more about the prince ride yeah yeah like like no no no no I can't get much money no I can do that
04:21:46.72 --> 04:21:51.84 to me kind of a thing like I'm never mean what like you know kind of really important thing you
04:21:51.84 --> 04:21:56.64 know the son or the grandson or something like that but yeah I thought that same thing to I said
04:21:56.64 --> 04:22:01.52 I get I get the example because true it is true it's basically like like saying without your
04:22:01.52 --> 04:22:04.48 health you have nothing you know like you can't you can't bring your mind to the grave like
04:22:04.48 --> 04:22:09.68 it's true true but there are these weird little exceptions where it's like that doesn't matter
04:22:09.68 --> 04:22:15.28 to some some people yeah that ego gets that ego starts to get charged up man it's um it can be
04:22:15.84 --> 04:22:21.92 it can definitely be a scary thing so it's like anybody even said this before where he goes essentially
04:22:21.92 --> 04:22:28.16 like a like a drug that you can you know some people like they'll they'll just take drugs till they die
04:22:28.16 --> 04:22:32.80 like you're gonna kill you that's an example yeah yeah exactly it's like that you know people
04:22:32.80 --> 04:22:37.84 those smoke cigarettes like so much it'll be like hey they think that I said was your ego will love
04:22:37.84 --> 04:22:44.64 you to death your ego will love you to death just like drugs will love you do like drugs love you
04:22:44.64 --> 04:22:51.76 yep and I took this from Jay I think if I remember correctly Jay Adams who is an old school
04:22:51.76 --> 04:22:59.20 skateboarder like dog town Z boys and I heard him saying drugs will love you to death
04:23:00.000 --> 04:23:04.24 because you know he had a bunch he had problems with addiction and went to jail and all the stuff and
04:23:04.24 --> 04:23:11.92 actually met him and kind of hung out with him little bit I was my friend my friend
04:23:11.92 --> 04:23:21.76 uh ran and underground skate downhill skate boarding uh event I like not just one but like
04:23:21.76 --> 04:23:27.44 a regular basis yeah and and it was like hey we're gonna meet at this random mountain that just
04:23:27.44 --> 04:23:33.52 got freshly paved the state just freshly paved some of them mountain and we're gonna meet out
04:23:33.52 --> 04:23:38.48 there and do downhill races have you ever been on a downhill skateboard uh I've been on a downhill
04:23:38.48 --> 04:23:46.64 skateboard yes okay I said oh I'll try what this is like or whatever I got on a downhill skateboard
04:23:46.64 --> 04:23:54.64 I went 20 feet and I was already going so fast I jumped off because I could see where this was going
04:23:54.64 --> 04:23:59.44 say it wasn't a good place I don't have the skill set to be doing this yeah guys race in levers
04:23:59.44 --> 04:24:06.72 like like a motorcycle racing letters they race in those things so I kind of so at any one of these
04:24:06.72 --> 04:24:13.68 underground events Jay Adams, REST and piece was there and you know I got to shake his hand and I
04:24:13.68 --> 04:24:23.36 didn't get a picture that's a bad move actually well how long ago was it 10 years? 10 years ago
04:24:23.36 --> 04:24:27.20 maybe 10 years oh maybe even a little bit longer ago you should have got a picture then
04:24:27.20 --> 04:24:32.80 pictures are available at that time because if it's like 1990 money oh no this was that this was
04:24:32.80 --> 04:24:37.12 recent this was like you know I was a grown man trying to get on a downhill skateboard
04:24:37.68 --> 04:24:44.56 those guys are freaking cool yes they are bombing hills yeah bombing hills you're on a
04:24:44.56 --> 04:24:48.56 scale this isn't on the snow or the water yeah like you fall on the snow look you can get
04:24:48.56 --> 04:24:53.04 her on snow for sure you can get her on the water you can notice there's a keyword there can
04:24:53.04 --> 04:24:58.88 you can get her on the water you can get her on the snow if you fall in a vegan downhill
04:24:58.88 --> 04:25:03.36 is it able to you're getting her now I the interestingly they don't they would let others they
04:25:03.36 --> 04:25:08.08 know how to fall better whatever yeah I think I think a lot of times especially in skateboarding in
04:25:08.08 --> 04:25:13.44 general that you just get hurt and I think those these guys are kind of just used to it where sure
04:25:13.44 --> 04:25:18.88 unless you break like your ankle you'd risk to whatever or whatever break whatever either hurt
04:25:18.88 --> 04:25:24.000 or you injured so skateboard is just used to get her it is basic well you get you get
04:25:24.000 --> 04:25:27.20 especially on the downhill right where you got to bail or whatever and you're sliding oh yes I mean
04:25:27.20 --> 04:25:32.64 oh you're what are you hitting someone's gonna stop you you know so Jay Adam said drugs will
04:25:32.64 --> 04:25:36.64 love you to death and as soon as I heard him say that I was yeah you know what also will love you
04:25:36.64 --> 04:25:43.20 to death your own ego your own ego will love you to death so you got to watch out for it you know
04:25:43.20 --> 04:25:49.76 yeah like the the short term payoff of what it delivers to you is just so makes you feel so good or safe
04:25:49.76 --> 04:25:55.60 or secure or whatever get that the later that like yeah I mean while you're your health safety
04:25:55.60 --> 04:26:00.72 well being got to be careful out well hey this has already been a really long podcast to
04:26:00.72 --> 04:26:06.88 appreciate everyone for listening if you want to support the podcast go to jockelfuel.com get some
04:26:06.88 --> 04:26:14.56 get some supplements of whatever kind you may need jockelfuel.com we also have look we talked
04:26:14.56 --> 04:26:21.36 a little bit about China today China we talked a little bit about China we are we are in an
04:26:21.36 --> 04:26:27.12 economic war with China for the time being could it escalate yes it could if we lose the economic
04:26:27.12 --> 04:26:32.48 war trust me the escalation is going to be real bad so we're in an economic war with China right
04:26:32.48 --> 04:26:38.96 now and at origin USA we are on the front lines of that war we are building stuff in America
04:26:39.68 --> 04:26:45.12 the things that Mike was talking about today you know a sense of purpose when you when you're
04:26:45.12 --> 04:26:52.64 not making anything you don't have let me refresh that when you are making something producing
04:26:52.64 --> 04:26:57.92 something building something you have a sense of purpose and when you're building something that's
04:26:57.92 --> 04:27:05.52 helping rebuild your community you haven't even greater sense of purpose so if you want to help us
04:27:06.56 --> 04:27:12.48 rebuild our communities help us rebuild our country help provide a sense of purpose
04:27:12.96 --> 04:27:22.000 to hundreds and one day thousands of hardworking Americans then check out origin USA.com get
04:27:22.000 --> 04:27:27.20 awesome stuff that's made in America yeah I think that that content kind of
04:27:28.72 --> 04:27:33.60 probably goes deeper than maybe we might think at a glance where you know all like you know
04:27:33.60 --> 04:27:38.000 as technology involves involves and all like all this other stuff or whatever you know basically it's
04:27:38.000 --> 04:27:43.76 just an it's an evolution of problems being solved so the smaller problems get solved solve just so
04:27:43.76 --> 04:27:49.12 you can take on bigger problems right and then we have innovation and you know all this
04:27:49.12 --> 04:27:54.48 invention like back in the day right you have these simple tools a stick or rock you know and you're
04:27:54.48 --> 04:27:59.04 making like you're spending five days making this one thing that literally you can buy at 70
04:27:59.04 --> 04:28:04.56 11 nowadays like that kind of stuff but back then it's just how it worked it's like yeah
04:28:04.56 --> 04:28:08.96 but if you want to fire bro it's going to take a lot to make that fire then after you make that
04:28:08.96 --> 04:28:13.04 fire it provides the warmth and the heat and you can cook for you and your family and all this stuff
04:28:13.04 --> 04:28:19.04 so it's like this little system that kind of works together but then when you start inventing
04:28:19.04 --> 04:28:23.92 things that fire part making the fire part becomes really inconvenient like we got to focus on this
04:28:23.92 --> 04:28:29.36 bigger problem here that making that fire takes like freaking I don't know 35 45 minutes that
04:28:29.36 --> 04:28:34.48 maybe would help us in this bigger problem if we could just do that in an instance so let's solve
04:28:34.48 --> 04:28:39.28 that problem in deaf or in in an indefinite level you know so boom we saw that problem now you
04:28:39.28 --> 04:28:43.84 got lighter as matches whatever right I'm sure it didn't happen in that order but I'm just saying for
04:28:43.84 --> 04:28:49.20 example but it just keeps going and going and going and going so we got a bunch of problem solved for us now
04:28:49.20 --> 04:28:54.16 yes all kinds of problems yes but now the problems because you know what's that hierarchy it's like
04:28:54.16 --> 04:29:01.92 had some hierarchy right hierarchy needs so now technology kind of like exploded so fast so now
04:29:01.92 --> 04:29:08.56 it ended us up on that that higher part of the hierarchy or the needs right but technology has it
04:29:08.56 --> 04:29:12.64 right now it's not good enough to solve those problems so now you got people
04:29:12.64 --> 04:29:20.48 depressed or whatever same same so now yeah if you we can infuse little sent sprinkles a
04:29:20.48 --> 04:29:25.76 sense of purpose into all of our lives really I think that's going to be the beginning of the
04:29:25.76 --> 04:29:29.92 the solution for our problem awakening yeah but it was just kind of like how micrussain where
04:29:30.48 --> 04:29:36.32 you kind of got to go down to the the baseline a little bit to explore like where can I infuse
04:29:36.32 --> 04:29:40.80 some of the purpose in that baseline then your life it just says the whole will be more
04:29:40.80 --> 04:29:46.56 more beneficial more fulfilling or whatever yeah I think fulfilling is the word yeah like you'll
04:29:46.56 --> 04:29:51.52 you'll feel more purpose like just in your day to day you know just how it works but all right
04:29:51.52 --> 04:29:58.40 think it works like that oh check so origin us a dot com cool awesome to support get it get whatever
04:29:58.40 --> 04:30:03.04 you need there also we got jocquistore dot com which echo Nate made up the name for very original

04:30:47.84 --> 04:30:54.48 now and it's weird because it's not like I was like hey what's the best kind of name for this or
04:30:54.48 --> 04:30:59.20 that you know and I make this it was just like it was just kind of like a foregone conclusion like

04:32:57.92 --> 04:33:04.40 It's funny that that academy because you have it under ashlandfront you know and I always
04:33:04.40 --> 04:33:09.44 looked at it or kind of imagined it as essentially oh this is what you you know if you work
04:33:09.44 --> 04:33:13.52 or if you manage a team your boss was something like that oh yeah perfect freaking perfect really
04:33:14.24 --> 04:33:18.40 but when you kind of look into it and you kind of go on there and stuff this is really what it is
04:33:18.40 --> 04:33:23.68 where it's like okay yeah sure I listen to jocco you know sometimes involuntarily against my
04:33:23.68 --> 04:33:28.32 will whatever but let's say involuntary I listen to jocco and you know I have some good advice
04:33:28.32 --> 04:33:35.36 you know and actually if I'm gonna tell the truth here where if I listen to and by the way
04:33:35.36 --> 04:33:39.84 kind of choose what you put in your head and what you listen to right so what choose to listen to you
04:33:39.84 --> 04:33:45.76 most of the time sure so now jocco with all this advice or whatever he actually has
04:33:45.76 --> 04:33:53.52 an online academy like to train you that's literally what it is it is like okay so I'll
04:33:53.52 --> 04:33:58.08 and I kind of took it for granted where I can ask you questions like when I see it easy I can
04:33:58.08 --> 04:34:03.20 literally call you up if you answer you've asked me a lot of questions over the years yes if you
04:34:03.20 --> 04:34:08.56 think about it now I'm not talking about questions about how to do a commira what you have asked me
04:34:08.56 --> 04:34:13.44 but I'm talking you come in with a legitimate scenario that is an instant out family scenario
04:34:13.44 --> 04:34:18.000 I needed advice straight up straight up just the other last time I saw you I asked you what do you
04:34:18.000 --> 04:34:22.24 think about this something about this or this and I need like straight up legitimately needed advice from
04:34:22.24 --> 04:34:26.56 you right now do I give you good advice yes I think so I'm following it I'll tell you that's working
04:34:26.56 --> 04:34:32.16 right now so far I guess it was more of a long-term decision making course straight up
04:34:32.16 --> 04:34:37.28 that we're probably thinking it's the right move because you probably weren't thinking no offense
04:34:37.28 --> 04:34:42.56 you may not have been thinking long-term yeah I'll just make that mistake we think short-term
04:34:42.56 --> 04:34:47.60 yeah what plays out I was it's like one of the things we're you know how you make this decision to
04:34:47.60 --> 04:34:54.48 pursue this it's gonna put this other thing on hold for a long time or you can pursue the other one
04:34:54.48 --> 04:34:58.96 and it'll put this one on hold either indefinitely or for a long time so it's like which one is
04:34:58.96 --> 04:35:03.20 the advice I gave you is very good by the way I agree and even when you said it it
04:35:03.20 --> 04:35:08.16 hit me so quickly that yep I think you're right you know that's a good call so if you didn't know me
04:35:08.16 --> 04:35:12.88 if you weren't we didn't hang out if we weren't doing the digital if we weren't doing the podcast
04:35:12.88 --> 04:35:18.40 and you had that question you could go to extremistrybore.com and literally ask me and I would give you
04:35:18.40 --> 04:35:22.000 the same advice exactly right and that's why I'm getting some more particulars maybe your
04:35:22.000 --> 04:35:26.32 scenario is different maybe your area of operations different but essentially you'd get at least
04:35:26.32 --> 04:35:30.64 now this means I'm gonna preach to you that I know 100% know but I would help you way through the
04:35:30.64 --> 04:35:34.72 options which is what I do with you right yeah exactly right and that's exactly what I was going to say
04:35:34.72 --> 04:35:39.68 it's that's exactly what it is you know where you and then of course you know you have a bunch
04:35:39.68 --> 04:35:46.000 of other experts in little little special specialty elements of life or whatever as well but yeah

04:37:20.16 --> 04:37:25.52 people do the same thing where it does this thing where anytime I listen to like micha or
04:37:26.40 --> 04:37:31.04 you know any pretty much anyone's story and you hear those cool little parts of it where it's like
04:37:31.04 --> 04:37:36.16 oh man I need to take away the computer from my kids from now on you know it's like you get sucked into
04:37:36.16 --> 04:37:42.16 a story so much like it's so um what do you call like so engaging that you kind of like I kind of

04:38:01.20 --> 04:38:04.72 soon saying because you see you get so immersed in like the story or whatever they knew
04:38:04.72 --> 04:38:09.28 he was talking about like the social media and I felt it I was like yeah you write social media so toxic
04:38:09.28 --> 04:38:17.52 but the reality is it can be toxic and it can be very beneficial like you you know and I'm you know
04:38:17.52 --> 04:38:23.28 you can be in communication with very valuable people for very good reasons I've gotten into
04:38:23.28 --> 04:38:32.24 social we've probably gotten 30 guests on this podcast legit awesome guests freaking so stoked
04:38:32.24 --> 04:38:38.000 from social media oh yeah so that's definitely and it's and it is a legitimate way to
04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:43.60 communicate with other people it doesn't mean you have to get in the algorithm so it's there
