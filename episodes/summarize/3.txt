So we tried to inspire the younger guys, the new guys, a guy that had no experience in the SEAL teams, but we wanted that guy to go, you know what, I'm going to get into this room, I'm going to take this building, I'm going to get to this rooftop, I'm going to get this good position and not to do it as a rogue element, but within the confines of what the strategy was and what the plan was. So, if you're trying to control someone by beating them down and saying, you failed, you need to do it this way, and it's the only way, you're going to get more control over them, but you're going to not allow them to operate in a real world where they have to think of new ideas and think of, think they have to free their mind. And you know, one of the things that I remember of where people get locked into these, you can see it sometimes in MMA fights, you'll see a fighter that's got a big good, you know, ground game or all of you's trying to do is take the person down, take the person down, use all the energy, just keep trying to cleanse, keep shooting shots and they're getting their shot stuff, but they can't adapt. And I think I did talk about this before, but taking care of your people, you know, and how taking care of your people, it can mean, hey, that means we're going to cut them loose early because that means you're taking care of them. And you know, these days where we see the big difference, you know, you see a big bureaucratic company, you know, now that we're working with businesses, we see a big bureaucratic company, they become very centralized in their control and they fight a Trish and Warfare against other companies because they're bigger and they have more resources. And you know what's a good, it's good time to this is, and I run it as with business leaders, where they know their superover, achievers and they expect that level of performance out of everyone and they're not going to get it. It's easy to train something people for something that they know is going to happen, but it's a lot more difficult to train people for something that is unknown, how do you do that? Where he just says, okay, you're going to start, you know, that's almost going to be on your back and you're going to try to escape, but doesn't matter. I talked about that before that people know, even if they don't know what the truth is, they know you're not telling them that. All the way down to the language we use, some people, you know, some people don't like if they are called boss. And as a matter of fact, there's not too many people like you echo and people that are listening this, there's not too many people like you either. And then what's beautiful about it is I'm surprised and happy and in, I'm surprised when people are supportive, when people are reliable, when people are good people, when they make sense, when they're not crazy. And I will usually get food them on that because they do realize that they're high performers and that they're overachievers and that they're not going to get so how are you going to set the expectations so that you're, you've got people that can actually achieve the expectations you've said for them. It's kind of like if you have this big trash can lid, and then you have this blob of like mercury, you're trying to keep it in the center, but don't try to like squeeze it with your hand or something because it's going to come out of your fingers. They've got decentralized command, they've got people taking chances, they're taking risks, they've got different leaders out there on the battlefield that are trying to make things happen. You know, if you don't know your name, you know, hey bro, the same thing boss. And if you don't want to go from zero to 10, do a small one, you know, do something like with low consequences, you know, or less impactful consequences and just start small and and go up. So again, you see this sometimes in the movies where they get the young officer and their green and they don't really know what's going on and then you get the salty old badass that's played by a salty old, you know, a clen Eastwood and that older guy with all the experience. You know, I've talked about this before like there was a time where I would try and convince people about things. The seal teams as a lot of people with a similar, you know, they're like, got some similar personalities in there, which is always fun. You know, Lafin, I talked about that, the fact that when we got back from Ramadi, you know, I started teaching it trade it, which is called training detachment. You got to train what you know, you got to practice what you know.
