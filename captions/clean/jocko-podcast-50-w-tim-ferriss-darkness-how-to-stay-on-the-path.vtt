00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 50 with echo Charles and me, Jockel, William. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
To be or not to be.

3
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That is probably the most famous of all of Shakespeare's lines.

4
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And in fact, it's so famous that it's often unfortunately used as a punchline.

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Use as a joke to be or not to be. It becomes easy to forget what Shakespeare is actually talking about.

6
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
He's talking about death and more specifically in this case he's talking about suicide.

7
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And Prince Hamlet, the character that delivers that famous line, who's often called insane,

8
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but who himself says, I am essentially not in madness, but mad in craft, meaning he is playing the role of insanity to further his own objectives.

9
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Not everybody even agrees on that point.

10
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But here's what Hamlet does say, to be or not to be that is the question.

11
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Whether it is no blur in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

12
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In other words, he's talking about is it worth it to suffer through the problems we have in life and he goes on or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing.

13
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And them, meaning should we fight against the pain of life, this sea of troubles and in that fight should we choose death, which is the only alternative to life.

14
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And he goes on to die, to sleep no more.

15
00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And by a sleep to say, we end the hardache in the thousand natural shocks that flesh is air to.

16
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So he's saying that death lets you escape all these hardships of life and these thousand natural shocks.

17
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And he finishes it out.

18
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It is a consummation to felt me to be wished for to die, to sleep.

19
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And he's saying that that is what we should wish for to die.

20
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And that is this most famous of Salila queues is about killing yourself.

21
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's about to aside.

22
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now we have a guest on today.

23
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And this is a guest who I've come to know since I sort of debuted in the world.

24
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And in fact, this guest happens to be the person that actually debuted me to the world that brought me into the world.

25
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
His name is Tim Fers.

26
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.000
In September of 2015, he interviewed me on his podcast, just prior to the release of my book Extreme Motors.

27
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, at the time, I was certainly a Tim Fers listener.

28
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'd read the four hour work week.

29
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'd listen to a bunch of his podcast, but I hadn't listened to all of them.

30
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I think I had kind of the broad view that most people have of Tim.

31
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The human guinea pig, the investor, the author, just you know Mr. Smart Successful Healthy Guy, who's out there enjoying the fruits of life.

32
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And with all that stuff in my mind, there I was in the first interview I had ever actually done with anybody ever.

33
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And it's a set up.

34
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This set up is it's an interesting set up going into this for me, right?

35
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
We're alone.

36
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I don't know Tim.

37
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I'm not the most open person in the first place.

38
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I don't know Tim.

39
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We meet two hours before.

40
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Now, we're in his house alone at a table.

41
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And the interview starts going kind of jocquish pretty quickly.

42
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I start going a little bit heavy on some stuff.

43
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And at one point, Tim asked me about books that I've read and I brought up about face.

44
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And then I brought up Corn Mac McCarthy, Blood Meridian.

45
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And I described how I liked that book because it captured the darkness, not just the darkness of the world, but the dark nature of human beings in the world.

46
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And Tim, after I described that darkness,

47
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:35.000
he said something along the lines of like, hey, jocco, I struggle with this.

48
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
How much should I voluntarily expose myself to darkness?

49
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Because I've had my own ups and downs that I contend with.

50
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then he kind of took that question from there and from that personal level.

51
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And he really quickly transferred it into something that was more about the world than about humanity in general.

52
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But the initial question that Tim started to ask, it wasn't about the world.

53
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And it wasn't about humanity in general.

54
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
The question that Tim was asking was about Tim.

55
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And I didn't catch that during the interview.

56
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I went right over my head, but when I listened to the interview, I caught it.

57
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And I heard that, but in this guy that we all see this happy, go lucky exterior.

58
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Kind of a solid image of mental and physical and spiritual strength.

59
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
There was some darkness in there.

60
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And Tim and I were going back and forth a few weeks ago.

61
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And he said something to me, you know, I'm not sure if I'm aligned with the types of guests you normally have on your podcast.

62
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And thinking back instantly did that moment.

63
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I said, oh no Tim, you definitely are.

64
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Because you are a person, you're a human.

65
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And this is a podcast about human nature.

66
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And despite all the success you've had, you've had some challenges in your life.

67
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
You've had some dark times and you still do.

68
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And we all do.

69
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And people ask me about suicide.

70
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I mean, most of the time it's some indirect messaging or some messaging through Facebook,

71
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but people will ask me about suicide, whether they're having those thoughts.

72
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And I haven't really addressed it directly.

73
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Because even though it's suicide has definitely impacted my life,

74
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:14.000
directly in some awful and horrible ways that I'll never forget.

75
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But I don't have that same level of knowledge.

76
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So today we do have that level of knowledge.

77
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And we're going to dive into it.

78
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So without further ado, Mr. Tim Ferris, welcome to the show.

79
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And thank you for coming on.

80
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Thanks for having me on.

81
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Now, I don't even want to play around here.

82
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I want to get right into it.

83
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I want to get this hard stuff done.

84
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I want to talk about this book that you just put out.

85
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It's called Tools of Titans.

86
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And in this book, and I just got done telling you this, you know,

87
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I looked and found the blog post that you would originally written.

88
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That's named a very Tim Ferris name in my opinion.

89
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's some practical thoughts on suicide, right?

90
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Only Tim would think about practical thoughts on suicide.

91
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So, and you sent me the book and I had found that blog pass and posted

92
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and I'd read it.

93
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But when you sent me the book, I saw that you had put it in the book.

94
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And I think that was awesome for you to do that to put it in this book,

95
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
so that people have access to it.

96
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So I want to get into this piece of it right now from the book.

97
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And here we go.

98
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Some practical thoughts on suicide.

99
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
In this chapter, I'm going to talk about suicide.

100
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And why I'm still on this planet.

101
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It might seem dark, but the objective is to give hope and tools to those who need them.

102
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
It is a much larger number than you might imagine.

103
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I kept the following story secret from my family, girlfriends, and closest friends for years.

104
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Recently, however, I had an experience that shook me, woke me up,

105
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and I decided that it was time to share everything.

106
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, despite the shame I might feel, the fear that is making my palms sweat

107
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
as I type this, allow me to get started.

108
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Here we go.

109
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So you had some serious hesitation on putting this out there in the first place.

110
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I did.

111
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It sat and drafts between six and nine months with fits and starts,

112
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because I had a lot of doubt about my motivations for putting it out.

113
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The good that it might do, the bad that it could have indirectly,

114
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that I couldn't foresee and for seeing consequences.

115
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And just the embarrassment and also the fear of how my family would respond.

116
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So there was a lot, there were a lot of factors that kept it in my drafts

117
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
for a very long time.

118
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And then this story that you tell here is the story of what made you finally decide

119
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to talk about it in the public forum.

120
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And what happened was a guy came up to you and said,

121
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
you were at an event, a guy comes up to you and says,

122
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
hey, can you sign this for my brother?

123
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It would mean a lot to him and you give him the hate, no problem.

124
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
You're kind of noticed that there's something odd about the way the guy is acting,

125
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
you sign the book and a little while later, as you're leaving,

126
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
he comes up and he says, you know, I got to talk to you.

127
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And you say, hey, got to leave, but what do you got?

128
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Let's go walk with me.

129
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And you find out that this guy's younger brother,

130
00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000
who you would just sign the book for, had recently killed himself at the age of 22.

131
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And this guy told you, people listen to you, Tim.

132
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Have you ever thought about talking about these things about suicide or depression,

133
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
you might be able to save someone?

134
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And then you say here in the book, I didn't know what to say.

135
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I also didn't have an excuse on bonnones to him.

136
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And I had every reason to talk about suicide.

137
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Some of my closest high school friends killed themselves,

138
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
some of my closest college friends killed themselves.

139
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And I almost killed myself.

140
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And you held that in for a long time.

141
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
There you were a public figure, you hadn't ever talked about this.

142
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now, as I said, for me, I certainly have brushed up against suicide,

143
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000
starting with my best friend when I was a kid, a kid named Jeff.

144
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And I had joined the Navy and I was in seal training, and I got wet.

145
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We had kind of grown apart.

146
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And I talked about this when I was on your podcast.

147
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I grew up with in a rural area in New England.

148
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And there was a lot of hippies and just kids, you know, dead heads and whatnot.

149
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I didn't go in that direction, but my really good friend did.

150
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And he ended up getting heavily involved in drugs and booze and everything else.

151
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And he got involved with the girl.

152
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And when they broke up, he killed himself in a horrible way that I'm

153
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
going to talk about.

154
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
But I got word of it.

155
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I was going through seal training.

156
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And I get word that disc kid, you know, that I was such good friends with, killed himself.

157
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And then on top of that, now we go 1993.

158
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And again, one of my best friends in the seal teams.

159
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And I got absolute stud of the individual of a human being, an incredible athlete,

160
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
quarterback at the Naval Academy.

161
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:37.000
By the way, record holder at the Naval Academy, just a hilarious guy, leader of men, just incredible human being.

162
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
They're an ultimately grisored.

163
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
He got murdered along with a female naval officer named Cario Neal.

164
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
They got murdered both of them.

165
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
By another Navy officer who also went to the Naval Academy, who then killed himself.

166
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So murder suicide.

167
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I'll tell you what, anybody that knew gris, I mean, this was just devastating.

168
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
This damn near broke my heart.

169
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And then most recently, in December of 2012, another seal that I knew, who was the commander of the seals in Afghanistan.

170
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:49.000
On deployment in Afghanistan, goes to a meeting, gets down to the meeting, goes to his room, shoots himself in the head, kills himself.

171
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:57.000
No suicide note, no strange behavior, no indicators, nothing.

172
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And like I said, this guy was in my sister, both of you, and it's the old team too.

173
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I mean, just a great guy, respected seal and boom, gone.

174
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And I guess that's why I feel strongly about truanning to bring you on and talk to you about this, because I know you felt it.

175
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Personally, you're talking about it.

176
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And personally, I actually have never wanted to go myself before.

177
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Now, I will say there are times in my life where I, where I cared less about living than other times.

178
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And it certainly in combat, I definitely accepted that I could die.

179
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And I was okay with it.

180
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And there's probably times in combat where I crossed the line a little bit towards the just straight, bring it on.

181
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Let's do this. But I never seriously had that, you know, that fall.

182
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
But it's something I know is out there, like I said, I've, it's brushed up against me, it's crushed me.

183
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And when you say in this book that you almost killed yourself, and we'll talk about what got you there, and how you ended up there.

184
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000
But how real is that feeling when it hits you?

185
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
There's nothing realer.

186
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I think that the, the delusion or the set of delusions that you find yourself in seem as real as this table that we're sitting at.

187
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
As real is anything you see or hear.

188
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
And the voices in your head that internal dialogue, the self-talk, is a powerful thing.

189
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000
It can be powerful and constructed ways and it can be powerful and extremely destructive ways. So for me, it felt permanent, it felt inescapable.

190
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
It felt concrete.

191
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I felt like I had a column of evidence exhibit A through Z to indicate that I would be better off killing myself.

192
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So it wasn't a desire to, it wasn't a desire to end my own life.

193
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It was a desire to stop suffering and stop causing the suffering of others or what I perceive to be inflicting on my loved ones and family members and so on.

194
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
And feeling trapped, I think above all, it's feeling trapped and feeling alone.

195
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Like you are flawed and in being flawed, you are unique.

196
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
And you should just be just be sent back to the factory and that equals taking yourself out.

197
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Extremely real though. It's definitely it was as concrete as any emotion or any object or any interaction that you could imagine.

198
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And it's got to be weird now and you say this.

199
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Like you're looking back at this now.

200
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And of course, this is so easy to see.

201
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And go, you know, I was not thinking straight.

202
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And right now you can tell it's not real.

203
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Or those problems that you perceive, you could tell that they weren't real problems.

204
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
They weren't unsolvable problems.

205
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
They weren't worth ending your life over.

206
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
But you get trapped in there.

207
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
And I think in particular, you do get trapped.

208
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And in my case, there were, say, five or six different events that happened roughly at the same time that caused me to spiral.

209
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And as I spiraled, I got to a point where I felt like I would never contribute anything meaningful.

210
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:34.000
To other people or to the world because I was so handicapped by this pessimistic dark view of the world of myself.

211
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000
And I was like, well, if that's the case, why go through all this pain to try to solve these various problems?

212
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
When completely, and like you said, and retrospect, it's ludicrous.

213
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I mean, it's ridiculous, but at the time it seemed anything but why not just control all the things?

214
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Control all delete.

215
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Let's just shut this computer down.

216
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
You know, I got, I get to see this a little bit right now.

217
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
You know, I got kids.

218
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And you know, I got teenage daughters.

219
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
And little things in the world that they think are the most important, great, you know, things in the whole world.

220
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I mean, literally like a dress or a pair of shoes.

221
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's okay.

222
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
We can get you some more shoes or whatever.

223
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:29.000
It's you get to see a glimpse of what you're talking about just with any human, any human anywhere that even in a workplace where someone's going through some problem that work.

224
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And they didn't get the report turned in on time.

225
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And they're acting like it's the end of the world.

226
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And it's actually the end of nothing.

227
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And actually, in many cases, means almost nothing.

228
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Almost nothing.

229
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I'm gonna go back to the book.

230
00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So you say to Silas, which is the guy that had come up and asked you to sign the book, you come up and say, you say, look, I'm sorry for your loss.

231
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
And then you had sort of the internal talk once again with yourself.

232
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And you say, I'd failed his brother bank being such a coward in my writing.

233
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
How many others had I failed these questions, so am in my mind.

234
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
And then you look at Silas and you say, I will write about this.

235
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I promise.

236
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:31.000
That's probably when you made your first decision to get this dress going actually.

237
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
You said, and with that, I got into the elevator.

238
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
And I added my own phrase on here and you should have had to be edit this.

239
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.000
But you said, and with that, I got in the elevator and I added and headed down.

240
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Because the next part of this is called into the darkness.

241
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And you've got a great quote in here that I'd never heard before.

242
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
The quote is, they tried to bury us.

243
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
They didn't know we were seeds.

244
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And I think that's an awesome quote.

245
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
They tried to bury us.

246
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
They didn't know we were seeds.

247
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And I can tell you that I didn't bury these thoughts and these feelings.

248
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And I'm thinking back, I'm just trying to kind of deconstruct where my attitude came from and all the stuff.

249
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And I think that when I grew up, I listened to some things that may, that just pull those seeds right out of the ground.

250
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Like they were playing his day.

251
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
When you grew up listening to kind of music that I listened to, just dark heavy music.

252
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
That's saying about this stuff.

253
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And I'll tell you there's one of the best pieces of music that you can hear on this subject.

254
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And I don't even know it's dark.

255
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000
But Henry Rollins on an album called Lifetime, there's a song called Gun in Mouth Blues.

256
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
And I saw him perform it many times live.

257
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And it took me through those emotions.

258
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
You'd go on YouTube and try to tell him it doesn't deliver the way it was when I was a kid.

259
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
When I was 14 or 15 years old and I got a guy on stage, a grown man, to me at that time, who was 25 or something.

260
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Whatever Rollins was at that time.

261
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And he's singing about that.

262
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And so for me, I'm thinking of myself, well those seeds weren't buried for me.

263
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
They were out, right?

264
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
I was thinking about that, but I wasn't like I was okay with me.

265
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
You know what I'm saying?

266
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
And a lot of the music that I listened to back then talked about that stuff.

267
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So I didn't bury those seeds ever really.

268
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
And I'm wondering, is that something that you did?

269
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Obviously you put the quote in here.

270
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
But how do you see yourself?

271
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
How did you bury those seeds?

272
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
So I included the quote for a few reasons.

273
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
The first is effectively exactly what you alluded to.

274
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.000
So these internal demons, these self-doubt, these self-criticisms,

275
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
I felt were a huge weakness.

276
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And so to compete to whether that's in sports, academic, otherwise, I kept that all in.

277
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
So I actually grew up on the same music or similar music.

278
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:33.000
But I was listening to Slayer, I was listening to a lot of dark music, which I can still appreciate the double bass and so on and

279
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Slayer album.

280
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
But for me, because I never, I never choose to express any of that.

281
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I had no release valve.

282
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.000
So it actually fed, I think, in a way, this type of self-loading.

283
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
And it could have been biochemical in the first place.

284
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I don't know, or bio-francline.

285
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And I mean, my family, at least on one side, has a history of extended depression and schizophrenia and so on.

286
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Skits are fringeless, but so maybe it started there.

287
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Who knows?

288
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
I don't know what the origin is.

289
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
And so I included that quote as a reminder of two things.

290
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
A, when you try to suffocate or bury or disregard these thoughts and emotions, as opposed to

291
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
content with them or deal with them in some fashion, they are seeds.

292
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
And you're pouring fertilizer on them when you try to neglect and avoid them.

293
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
The second reason I put that in is to remind myself, if you feel like external,

294
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
if you feel like external circumstances or external actors, meaning people,

295
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
or stack in the deck against you, or trying to bury you,

296
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
or try to defeat you in some fashion, you are the seed.

297
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So you can recover from that.

298
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And there's strength to be found in the struggle.

299
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
So I included it for both of those reasons.

300
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Yeah, that's, and I've talked about that before this idea of battling demons, right?

301
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And one of the things I, I said on the podcast, I want to earlier podcasts,

302
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
I just said, don't let the demons ambush you.

303
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Don't let them sneak around in there.

304
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
You got to bring them out.

305
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
You got to, you got to bring them out and confront them and deal with them.

306
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Don't try and bury them.

307
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Bring them out.

308
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And so that's, that's very similar.

309
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And also, when you were a kid, this is, this is also interesting because you are an overachieverist.

310
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Kid, right?

311
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
I was good in school.

312
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I was very, very small.

313
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I got the shit kicked out of me routinely up until about six, right?

314
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
But you wrestled.

315
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
You were a good wrestler, right?

316
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I did.

317
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Yeah, I got up to a national level towards the end of high school.

318
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I did not wrestle in college since it was title nine at Princeton where I ended up going.

319
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
But I was a academically, certainly a high-gear.

320
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And I'll get a rest.

321
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And a really good wrestler, academically, I mean, you're going to Princeton, right?

322
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Right?

323
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
So that's pretty much.

324
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
And then you landed Princeton.

325
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
By the way, that everybody's kicking ass.

326
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Yeah.

327
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Yeah.

328
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
No, no, I, I, I had very sport parents did really well in school.

329
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Got to Princeton and realized everyone was at that level where I heard.

330
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And it's a different playing field.

331
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
And, and is that one of the things you think that as you started thinking about this darkness?

332
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
You're looking at these other people going, oh, they don't have that.

333
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I got a barrier because they're all smart as me and great athletes.

334
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And so I'm competing with them.

335
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
And I don't want to have that chalk against me of saying, oh, you know,

336
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I'm a little bit sad today.

337
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
That's bad.

338
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I'm going to be positive.

339
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
For sure.

340
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I think that was part of it.

341
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
On one hand, I enjoy competing.

342
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So having a much stronger competitors didn't bother me at all.

343
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I was actually pretty thrilled about it.

344
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
But I did feel like two compete on this higher level playing field.

345
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
It would not be who's me or help me to walk around the moaning my weaknesses at all.

346
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
So I didn't.

347
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And I felt like particularly being the,

348
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
the, going to that school was a real stretch from my entire family and extended family.

349
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I felt like I had to deliver and there was no pressure for my parents whatsoever.

350
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
But I don't need anyone else's pressure.

351
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
I can deliver plenty of that for myself.

352
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And I felt that a lot was riding on that.

353
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And the plan, of course, as many people might have in their lives is get good grades in high school.

354
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Go to a good college, get great grades in college, go get to a fantastic job and so on and so forth.

355
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So which led up to a lot of the catalyzing events later in college in senior year that really the,

356
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
the straws that broke the candles back.

357
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Because I was, I wasn't always near the precipice.

358
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I mean, I was healthy for long stretches of time.

359
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Then I'd have maybe a depressive period, but it was manageable.

360
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Oftentimes coincided with winter.

361
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I don't handle that type of weather very well, which is part of the reason that I live on the West Coast.

362
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
And did you, did you, were you self aware of that?

363
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
A very, very, very, at the time, probably less aware of the weather, having the impact that it did.

364
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
But you would literally say, oh man, I'm feeling down right now.

365
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
This is one of my particular things. It'll be okay.

366
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Definitely.

367
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
And it used, that's pretty introspective for a kid.

368
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Well, I spent a lot of time on my own head.

369
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
And there are benefits that come from that.

370
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
You can get very good academics. And then sometimes you're just your own resenemies.

371
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
So being trapped in my head is not always the, the, the carnival that you might think it to be.

372
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Sometimes it is for sure, depending on what I've eaten or imbibbed as well.

373
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But that's a separate podcast.

374
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
The, the, but I've learned to manage it and we're jumping a little bit ahead.

375
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
But for instance, and we'll get to it.

376
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
I'm sure, but the writing of the senior thesis, that was a major trigger for a lot of reasons.

377
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Now, for instance, you know, writing the book that's sitting in front of us,

378
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I flew a researcher from Canada to be with me almost 24, seven,

379
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
while I was in the final six to eight weeks of writing this book.

380
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Why did I need him to come from Canada to be their in person?

381
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
No, absolutely not.

382
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
But I wanted another human around.

383
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
So I wouldn't go red, red, red, red, red, red.

384
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
And when you write seven hundred pages of books, my brother, you're going to end up,

385
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
but a lot more likely, and up in the red book, you're in the normal room.

386
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So you're right that we do start getting into this.

387
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Let's talk about this.

388
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
But can I, can I say one thing?

389
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
One of the reasons, and you did give me a 20 to say this so unfairness.

390
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
One of the reasons that I recommend your podcast so much is because you talk about the darkness.

391
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
And you talk about how common it is.

392
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
And I think the reason, for instance, out of the blue, one of my friends,

393
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
super handsome guy, wealthy family, ladies thrown themselves out of high school,

394
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
kills themselves out of the blue, no one expected it.

395
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
And I think that when you find people in any circumstance who end up taking it to that point,

396
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
it's because they think it is a rare flaw.

397
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
They're the one in a thousand who happens to be so fucked up beyond repair that it's not worth continuing

398
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
and by exposing and discussing the darkness, you realize,

399
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I mean, that's 50% of the people, or more, 50% of the time.

400
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
It is extremely common.

401
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
No matter what you think your defect is, anger, depression, you have plenty of people to keep you company.

402
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
So, and it's crowded up there.

403
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That's crowded.

404
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
So that's a great point.

405
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Let's go into this then when we go into what happened and some of the things that went down,

406
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
this downward spiral is what you call it.

407
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
And again, in here, I'm going back to the book.

408
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
In hindsight, it's incredible how trivial some of it seems.

409
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
And I put my note next, that's like, because you're detached from it now.

410
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And that's such a key thing I talk about all the time.

411
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
We want to remain detached from things.

412
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
We don't want to get wrapped up in the emotions.

413
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
We want to stay back because when you detach from it,

414
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
every answer is so clear when you're not wrapped up in it.

415
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
This is this stuff that happened to you.

416
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Sure, was it challenging?

417
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Yes, did it suck?

418
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
It was it hard?

419
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Yes, of course.

420
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
But detached from it now, you're looking at it.

421
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
You might literally be laughing at this stuff now.

422
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Oh, I do. I mean, I wrote it.

423
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And that's why at the end, there's this part.

424
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Towards the end, it's like many of you might be thinking,

425
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
wait a second, a Princeton student got a really bad grade.

426
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Boofuck and who?

427
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Are you kidding me?

428
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Yeah.

429
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But that's the whole point.

430
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
That's the whole point.

431
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Is that you don't, is that people, we don't detach, we get absorbed in this stuff and it becomes our world.

432
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So you get, I'm going back to the book.

433
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I include wording like impossible situation,

434
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
which was reflective of my thinking at the time.

435
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And it begins senior year,

436
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
slated to graduate in June of 1999,

437
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
somewhere in the next six months,

438
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
all these things happen.

439
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
First, you fail to make it to the final interviews for McKenzie consulting.

440
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
And at some other company,

441
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
and you start losing confidence.

442
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
So this is the first time you get kind of a little bit beat in your life a little bit.

443
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
For sure.

444
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I was doing extremely well academically,

445
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
and all of a sudden I didn't know what I was doing wrong.

446
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
And just to provide a little bit of context.

447
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
And it's like, this is like, I've this huge smirk on my face because it's so ridiculous.

448
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
You know, in hindsight,

449
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
but at Princeton,

450
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
or any Ivy League school, really,

451
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
there are only a handful of industries that recruit.

452
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Primarily, you find management consulting firms and investment banks.

453
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Why?

454
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Because they want to hire you and then use your pedigree, Princeton,

455
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
so that they can charge their clients in the case of management consulting $500 now

456
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
for photocopy.

457
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Right?

458
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
It's not at all as exotic it might seem,

459
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
but everyone is competing for those slots.

460
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And I didn't know it to do next,

461
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
so I just decided being very driven in that way.

462
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I'm going to compete for whatever one is going after.

463
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Because I think I can beat them.

464
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Now, this is the first time that I really

465
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
felt like, A, I got my ass handed to me,

466
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
and B, this was important.

467
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
If I lose a wrestling match,

468
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
I know why I lost.

469
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Here, I didn't know what was wrong.

470
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So that unknown variable hit me reasonably hard.

471
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I can imagine that now you're doubting everything.

472
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And the wrestling match you go,

473
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
hey, my conditioning wasn't good.

474
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Or hey, my takedown's one on point.

475
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
And here you're just going to know what was wrong.

476
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
I don't know what was wrong.

477
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Exactly.

478
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Something's wrong with me.

479
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And no one could tell me,

480
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
even the people who interviewed me,

481
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
they wouldn't give me the feedback.

482
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
So that's point A.

483
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Very shortly thereafter,

484
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
have a long-term girlfriend break up with me.

485
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Which again, in isolation,

486
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
I think I could have weathered in a head weathered many times before.

487
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
But I'm kind of reeling on my heels a little bit.

488
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And then my...

489
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Hold on.

490
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I'm going to go to the book here

491
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
because you give some pretty good specifics on that.

492
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
She breaks up with you because this is from the book.

493
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Because I became insecure during that period.

494
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Wanted more time with her.

495
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
And was massively disrupted to her varsity sports.

496
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
But my point is that these things compounded.

497
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
You get insecure.

498
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
And you think, why didn't they hire me?

499
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And then you look at your girl and say,

500
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
well, I'll go to her for comfort.

501
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
But I need more from you.

502
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
And she's going, which all humans do,

503
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
which is, oh, you want to throw yourself at me?

504
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I don't need you.

505
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Exactly.

506
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
It was not only that, but...

507
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
So she wakes up like you do.

508
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
And I tend to go to bed when you do.

509
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
And so I would want to have this late night.

510
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Conversations.

511
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And it screwed up her competition.

512
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
I mean, it was extremely important.

513
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Or rightly so.

514
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
She was a varsity athlete.

515
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
So, exit stage left.

516
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Girlfriend gone.

517
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And then the primary piece of this.

518
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So, the in my mind that checkmate for a loss was the interactions that I had with my

519
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
counselor or thesis advisor.

520
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And I was in the East Asian Studies Department.

521
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I started in psychology and then I moved from neuroscience to East Asian Studies to focus on language acquisition.

522
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And the senior thesis, just to put this in perspective,

523
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
not every college university has a mandatory senior thesis.

524
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Princeton does.

525
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And it breaks a lot of kids.

526
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
So, I'm not unique in this, but I thought I was a tiny.

527
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
It breaks a lot of kids.

528
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
When you say breaks, like, they don't graduate because they don't finish it.

529
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Or they just get emotionally, they go through total turmoil.

530
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
But they're the above and what I realized after the fact is, a lot of kids kill themselves.

531
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Actually, at many of these top schools.

532
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And I'm sure other schools, but it's such a pressure cooker or the kids perceive it that way.

533
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
I've got to feel old, call on kids.

534
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Regardless, it's such a pressure cooker for you, Tim.

535
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
It's very, very common.

536
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
So, it really does break a lot of kids.

537
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
But it's generally, let's just call it, and it varies by department, but 60 to 100 pages, sometimes longer.

538
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000
And it can count for 25% of your four year or the secumulative departmental GPA.

539
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
It is weighed very, very, very heavily.

540
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
So, even if you've had straight days, it can really throw a wrench into the works.

541
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
If you want to finish with a very strong GPA.

542
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Now, keep in mind, I had already been turned down for jobs.

543
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
And this is, so they go together here.

544
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Lose my crutch that's keeping me up, which is the girlfriend.

545
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And then at that point, I am researching for my thesis.

546
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Everything's going fine so far.

547
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
And I meet with the head of curriculum design for Berlitz International, which is near Princeton.

548
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Had a great dinner, and he said, it's really too bad you're graduating in X number of months,

549
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
because we actually have a fantastic job for you that I could give you right now.

550
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
You'd be a perfect fit.

551
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
So, I think to myself, well, this is going to solve a few different problems.

552
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
I don't know what I want to do.

553
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
I'm not getting picked up by these other companies.

554
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Why don't I take some time off?

555
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
And figure out the job, and then figure out the thesis.

556
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Now, the thesis, I'm going a little bit out of order here,

557
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:36.000
but the thesis was important because I had a meeting with my thesis advisor, who had his own research agenda,

558
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
and as is very common in academics, professors will utilize the help of students at times

559
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.000
to integrate things or research things for them, slave labor, slave labor, and he dropped a pile of 50, 60 pages of original Japanese research.

560
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
So, this is all in Japanese to integrate into my thesis.

561
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
It wasn't fit.

562
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
It was a round-pang in a square hole.

563
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
It would be nearly impossible to put into my thesis, but I decided, all right, well, he's the advisor.

564
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
He's tenured.

565
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
This is mandatory.

566
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
It's not optional.

567
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Then I figured out, oh my god, well, I could take this job, take your off, do a great job,

568
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
and thesis, come back, problem solved them.

569
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
So, I have a meeting with my thesis advisor to tell him that I'm going to do this,

570
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:27.000
not realizing at the time also that his research needs of me, our time sensitive.

571
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And he lost it.

572
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
He basically said, oh, you're just going to cop out.

573
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And take all this time off school.

574
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Well, better be the best thesis I've ever seen in my life.

575
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And not so subtly saying, I'm going to thank you.

576
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
If this is what you're going to do, I'm going to thank you.

577
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
And I don't think I was misreading that.

578
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And I was completely bewildered, then really upset,

579
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
meaning sad, depressed, then really angry.

580
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
And I was like, you know what?

581
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
This is bullshit.

582
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
This is Princeton University.

583
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Focus on the undergrad. This should be a solvable problem.

584
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
So I go to people in the administration.

585
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And I tell them what happened.

586
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
And collectively, the response was effectively he wouldn't do that.

587
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Because once you have your immunity bracelet in the form of tenure,

588
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
you're not getting voted off the island.

589
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And even people within the department would not pick fight with him,

590
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
or even really seek to clarify it.

591
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
And that was when I felt totally hopeless.

592
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
And that was kind of the beginning of the end as I saw it.

593
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
At that point, it's very important to note,

594
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
I was not suicidal.

595
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I just felt completely trapped.

596
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And without options, I ended up regardless taking the year off.

597
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
And that is where things got particularly dark.

598
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Because I went from being surrounded by students.

599
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Didn't have the girlfriend, but I was in a social environment

600
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
to working for Berlitz, but what I didn't realize was going to be

601
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
the set up, the logistics was working remotely.

602
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
What does that mean? That means that I'm off campus now.

603
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
With two of my friends, go to work every day, normal hours.

604
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
And I'm left in a bedroom or a living room alone

605
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
to try to work on my thesis and to do work for Berlitz.

606
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Completely solo.

607
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
That is where the carnival in my head is a very dangerous thing.

608
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
I'm outmatched.

609
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And we can keep going.

610
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Yeah, I mean.

611
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
So the other thing that struck me as once that happens,

612
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
now you also start to see your friends graduate graduate.

613
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
And they're all done.

614
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
They've gone.

615
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
They've gone.

616
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
They've gone.

617
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
They've gone.

618
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Yeah.

619
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
That was seemed to be a huge piece of it as well.

620
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
And then I'm going to go to the book back to the book here.

621
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Your coping mechanism is to cover myself and sheets

622
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
minimize time awake and hope for a miracle.

623
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
No miracle arrives.

624
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
One afternoon, as I'm wandering through a barns and noble

625
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
with no goal in particular, I chance upon a book about suicide.

626
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
That's right there in front of me on a display table.

627
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Perhaps this is the miracle.

628
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
I sit down and read the entire book,

629
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
taking copious notes into a journal,

630
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
including other books listed in the bibliography.

631
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
For the first time in ages, I'm excited about research.

632
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
In a sea of uncertainty and hopeless situations,

633
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
I feel like I've found hope.

634
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
The final solution.

635
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.000
The idea just appears in a book.

636
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Yeah.

637
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Then you go full tin ferris on this thing.

638
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah, with the same enthusiasm and rigor and OCD

639
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
that I tackle anything, I dove into that

640
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
and went to Farson Library,

641
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Great Library.

642
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Princeton to check out as many of those referenced books

643
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
possible to do my research.

644
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
And one of them was not in.

645
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
One of the key pieces.

646
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
And so I made a request, put in a request to get notified.

647
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
I was living, I think it was Lawrenceville,

648
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
which is near Princeton at the time.

649
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
And I think it's worth noting that I was pass the point of deciding,

650
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
yeah, I was in planning.

651
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
You say that in the book and I'll just read it.

652
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
It's important to mention that by this point,

653
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
I was passed deciding.

654
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
The decision was obvious to me.

655
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
I'd somehow failed, painted myself into this ridiculous corner,

656
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
wasted a fortune on school that didn't care about me.

657
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
So what would be the point of doing otherwise?

658
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
To repeat these types of mistakes forever,

659
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
to be a hopeless burden to myself and my family and my friends.

660
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Fuck that.

661
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
The world was better off without a loser who couldn't figure out this basic shit.

662
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
What would I ever contribute?

663
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Nothing.

664
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
So the decision was made and I was in full on planning mode.

665
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
In this case, I'm a dangerously good at planning.

666
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
I have four to six scenarios all spaced out, start to finish.

667
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Or sorry, specced out, start to finish, including potential collaborators

668
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
and covers when needed.

669
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So as you just said, as you just pointed out,

670
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
you were full on Tim Ferris, research complete, decision made,

671
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
going forward, figure out the best way to execute this,

672
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
and make it happen.

673
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Oh yeah, yeah, I remember actually something that's not in there.

674
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I recall when I had the plans and then it was a matter of scheduling.

675
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000
And I was waiting for that last book to see if I missed any research before proceeding.

676
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
But I had driven to Firestone, taken out these books, and was very lethargic.

677
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
I remember I mean, this coincides with this type of deep depression.

678
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
It was very tired all the time.

679
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
And laid down on my van.

680
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
My used minivan, hand me down for my mom.

681
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
After going to Firestone and just slept for like three or four hours.

682
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
And woke up and I was like, okay, let's just get this done.

683
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Let's figure it out and put it on the calendar.

684
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:40.000
And the what prevented that, it was pure luck.

685
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I had forgotten that instead of using my Lawrenceville address,

686
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
I hadn't changed my address with the registrar.

687
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
So my mail was going back to my home address where my parents lived on Long Island.

688
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
And so my mom gets this postcard in the mail.

689
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I mean, thank God this didn't happen a few years ago, would be the email.

690
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
She wouldn't have seen it.

691
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
And it said, in effect, good news.

692
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
The book on suicide that you reserved is now available at Firestone, library for pickup.

693
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
So I got a very nervous call from my mom, which I did not expect.

694
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Didn't interrupt plans.

695
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Did you, did you think your mom, did your mom sense it?

696
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Oh yeah, I could tell.

697
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
I mean, her voice was very shaky.

698
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And I quickly tapped an instant and talked my way out of it.

699
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
And I said, oh no, no, no, it's a friend at Rutgers. He couldn't get it at his library.

700
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
So I made, I reserved it at Firestone.

701
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000
But it shocked me out of my self-imposed false reality.

702
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And it was, it sounds so odd to say, but it was the first time that I realized my suicide would affect.

703
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
No matter how cleverly I laid it out, it would ruin the lives of people around me.

704
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Because I thought, well, let me figure out a scenario where I can make it look like a complete accident.

705
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
It won't look like suicide.

706
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
It'll just look like an accident old death.

707
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And I really, I really figured it out.

708
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
And it didn't matter.

709
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
It didn't matter.

710
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
It didn't matter.

711
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
I realized after that phone call that,

712
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Did your mom confront you with it?

713
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
She asked me about it.

714
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And I was very fast to come up with the Rutgers lie.

715
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Did she say, like, hey Tim, are you okay?

716
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
She did.

717
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
And we love you.

718
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
We love you, right?

719
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And it wasn't a 32nd conversation.

720
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
It was a longer conversation.

721
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
And there were follow-up phone calls.

722
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Props to mom for picking up on that.

723
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Yeah.

724
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Yeah.

725
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
So that was dodging a bullet metaphorically.

726
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
No, no, no.

727
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
No, no.

728
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
No, no.

729
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
I'm going to go into this here.

730
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
It's sort of you get through that.

731
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
You kind of get through what you just said.

732
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
You realize that this wasn't just about you.

733
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
This was going to hurt everybody.

734
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And you can't go through that.

735
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
And then you say, the very next week, I decided to take the rest of my year off,

736
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
truly off, to hell with the thesis and focus on physical and mental health.

737
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
That's how the entire sumo story of the 1999 Chinese kickboxing

738
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Sandsuit Championships came to be if you read the four hour work week.

739
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
So you go on a full on year off just complete.

740
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Now my question for you on that is, what about normal people?

741
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Normal people, right?

742
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Normal people that can't take a full on year off.

743
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:35.000
They got to find another way to get their focus off the what's going on in the brain at the work and get out of that carnival and focus on their mental and physical health.

744
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
While they're working their job taking care of their kids doing whatever they have to do for sure.

745
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
It doesn't normal person to go that off.

746
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Well, there are, I think a few strategies and tactics that I have used in

747
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
continued to use.

748
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
So it's critical that people understand.

749
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
It's not like I sumited the mountain, slave the dragon and I'm done.

750
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
This is a movie that tends to like Groundhog Day repeat itself,

751
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:12.000
not necessarily that intensely, but if you are predisposed to periods of darkness as many people are,

752
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
you need to develop coping strategies.

753
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
And it's not so much the year off.

754
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000
It was a focus on other things, right?

755
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000
That helped.

756
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
And there are a few.

757
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
I mean, looking back on it now, I have a better toolkit.

758
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
The first is, people talk about mind over matter, mind over body, mind over body this type of stuff.

759
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
I think body over mind has extremely underrated.

760
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
So if you can't get out of your head, get into your body.

761
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Number one, that is the number one.

762
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Get out and move and really things didn't change for me dramatically until I started

763
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
oddly enough, getting punched in the head going to the toughest boxing gym I've ever seen in

764
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Trent and New Jersey, where I was the only guy not on work release.

765
00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
So I don't recommend that therapy for everyone, but you know, one broken nose,

766
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000
a lot of bloody sparring sessions later, I was feeling more like my old self.

767
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000
So if you can't get out of your mind, get into your body.

768
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And your body is very important.

769
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
There are a lot of good biochemical reasons for this.

770
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I'll back that up to Tim Kennedy, who is an MMA fighter.

771
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Amazing.

772
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Good to snore some guy.

773
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
He posted something on Instagram, a month ago or something like that, in Facebook and whatever.

774
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000
And basically he was saying he's addressing PTSD and that sort of darkness, right?

775
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:37.000
And he basically said, look guys, get out, go work out, go push yourself.

776
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
And it's very similar to what I tell people like, hey man, you know, do you just do lift weight,

777
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
sprint, surf, go get outside, get into your body.

778
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000
So I think that's universally, I universally agree with that statement.

779
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000
So let me lay out a couple of super concrete recommendations.

780
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
And I should say, in advance, I'm not a doctor.

781
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
I don't play one on the internet.

782
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
So you may need certainly there are many people who need medical interventions,

783
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
whether it's pharmaceuticals or otherwise.

784
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
In my case, a few things that very much help, with or without other adjuncts, cold therapy.

785
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:22.000
So cold exposure, and this has been studied very, very effective as a supplemental or singular therapy

786
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
for anti-depressive purposes.

787
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
It's very, very effective.

788
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
So I routinely, and when I'm home in San Francisco, for instance, even along the winter,

789
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
I take short cold showers, pure cold showers.

790
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000
And Van Gogh, for instance, when he lopped off his ear, and was put into treatment,

791
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
he had two ice paths every day.

792
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
That was one of the treatment protocols.

793
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
And it's been looked at quite closely in the last few years.

794
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
It's a cold exposure one.

795
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
So even if you don't get outside of the house, that's an option.

796
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
You're going to take showers hopefully.

797
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Anyway, then you have, if you can afford it,

798
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
I think a good test to have performed is comprehensive blood work.

799
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Look at micronutrient deficiencies in particular.

800
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:14.000
So you could have, this is very common with depleted ground soil,

801
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
selenium deficiency, zinc deficiency, copper deficiencies.

802
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:26.000
These affect hormone production, and much more, and can be fixed relatively easily once you identify them.

803
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
I have, for instance, one was deficient in selenium.

804
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
What's going through to per se period, and he started eating Brazil nuts,

805
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
very high in selenium content.

806
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
And he called me a week later, and I feel like I'm on cocaine.

807
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
Now, that's a dramatic example.

808
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.000
And no, you shouldn't use cocaine to fix your depression.

809
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:55.000
But blood work, I think it is, if you get your car checked more often than you get your body checked,

810
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
you need to rearrange your priorities.

811
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Stoicism would be the next one.

812
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
I find senacan, particular, moral letters to lukillus,

813
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Marcus are really as, people tend if they read both, either be full on Marcus,

814
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
or really as guys, or full on Senacan guys.

815
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
And there's not a whole lot overlap.

816
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I tend to read Senacan, but I will listen to, say, one of the letters,

817
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
letters of lukillus every few days.

818
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
And if I'm going through a top period, I will listen to a 50-minute letter,

819
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000
every day, in the morning, as I walk to say, get a cup of coffee.

820
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And what Stoicism helps to teach you at its core, I think, or what represents is an operating system for being non-reactive in high stress situations.

821
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
And high stress is relative.

822
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
High stress could be going to the DMV and waiting and lying for some people.

823
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000
But Stoicism is also not just something you read, it's a practice.

824
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
So there's fear setting and fear rehearsal is very important.

825
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
So the practicing the worst case is something that I'll do regularly for instance,

826
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
taking a few days of every month to fast.

827
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
I do that.

828
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Taking a few days every month or every quarter to sleep on your kitchen floor and a sleeping bag and eat oatmeal for a few days.

829
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
And I realize, even if I have to quit my job, even if I get fired from my job.

830
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Because a lot of concerns for many people are financial, I'll be fine. Things are fine. Things are manageable.

831
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000
So I spent a lot of time defining the worst case scenarios, not just being vaguely afraid of bad things happening,

832
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:37.000
and practicing them so that I build up some level of immunity and not immunity, but it's in the noculation.

833
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
It's like getting a flu shot.

834
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Stress and noculation is what we didn't see the things we did the other day.

835
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000
So you go through hard training. You put all kinds of combat stress and it's not where you get any scenarios.

836
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And real life, you're kind of used to it.

837
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Well, exactly. And did one of my other favorite quotes and I'm probably not going to get the pronunciation right on this name.

838
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000
But Arca Locus, I think it is, says we do not rise to the level of our hopes.

839
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
We fall to the level of our training.

840
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
And that applies to a lot more of the military, applies to everything.

841
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
So there's a few recommendations.

842
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:16.000
I do think I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some type of meditation or mindfulness practice, which can take dozens of forms.

843
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
It can take the form of exercise.

844
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Anything with a repetitive motion or anything quite frankly that forces you to be present state aware.

845
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
If you're performing Olympic lifting, I guarantee you're nothing about your to-do list.

846
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah, or the argument that you had with the coworker. That's, you know, I think it was when I was doing a follow-up for the first podcast that I did with you.

847
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
That's somebody asked me about meditation.

848
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And I was like, no, I don't meditate.

849
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
I guess what I do do. Surf, jiu-jitsu, weight lift, all this other stuff.

850
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
So that kind of falls into, again, I don't know because you say, do you meditate?

851
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:57.000
My answer is no, I don't meditate. You don't see me sitting in a corner with my legs crossed indie and style chanting, right?

852
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
I don't do that. Do I get those benefits that people talk about?

853
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Do I feel them when I'm on the jiu-jitsu mat or when I'm Olympic weight lifting or when I'm doing whatever these physical activities I do?

854
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
I guess I do. I guess that's where it is.

855
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
And I think my word that I go back to all the time is being able to detach already.

856
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Said, once a day is being able to detach from these situations, detach from these stresses that are there.

857
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
And actually going back to the book here, you say,

858
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I return to Princeton, turn in my now finished thesis to my still sour advisor, get chewed up in my thesis defense, and I don't give a fuck.

859
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000
And I think that is a very powerful tool, that is a very powerful tool.

860
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
And he had to go, me through all kinds of things.

861
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
And I'll tell you specifically, like, oh, things are going bad at work, fire me.

862
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Go ahead, you're going to fire me, do it, bring it on.

863
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I'll find another job, I'll do something else, you know, even in the sealed teams, you know, in my book,

864
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
I talked about this horrible situation that happened with the Fratur side.

865
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
And that was the beginning of deployment.

866
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Well, as things continue to on deployment, more, it's not like the bad things stop there.

867
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Other bad things are going to happen.

868
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
And what I knew was that I was doing the best job I possibly could do.

869
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
And if you guys above me in the chain of command, want to come and fire me, bring it.

870
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
And it wasn't that I actually didn't care, but I kind of told myself, I didn't care.

871
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000
And when you release yourself of that stress of caring, you can actually perform better.

872
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:34.000
You perform better when you say, you know what, and we talk about with fighters all the time, fighters will be in an event.

873
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
And maybe they have a hard match and they barely get through and then they go, you know what, screw this.

874
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000
I don't even care if I went and lose.

875
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
They go out there and have the performance of a lifetime because they relieve themselves of that stress.

876
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:50.000
So sometimes, not caring is one of the best antidotes for doing performing better.

877
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000
But it's very contradictory because you're saying, okay, I got to perform really well.

878
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
So what do I do? I'm not going to care about it, but I want to perform well.

879
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000
But you got it. And I used to say this with guys would deal with girls, right?

880
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
In the sales teams, you got the guys they're going through, you know, they're young guys, right?

881
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
They're 20 years old, 22 years old. And so they get these relationship problems sometimes.

882
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
You got to help them through that.

883
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
And one of the things I'd say, listen, listen, but you know, they would be sad because they, whatever.

884
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
And I'd say, listen, man, you got to not care.

885
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:21.000
And then I'd say, you can't just act like you don't care.

886
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
You have to actually not care. That's what you actually have to, you have to actually not care.

887
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
And if you do that, you're good. And you can walk away.

888
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Because somebody asked me that the other day on Twitter, how do you get over, how do you get over someone that you love that doesn't want you anymore?

889
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
And I was like, where's the luck? Walk away.

890
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Don't look back.

891
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Don't look back. You've got to not care.

892
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
And I think when you set, when you wrote that in the book right there, I think it's a powerful thing.

893
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000
It is. And I want to look at the ingredients that led to that, or at least one of them.

894
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So a key component in that entire story is after deciding, after having the mom intervention,

895
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:14.000
after deciding to focus on other things, getting the thesis done, but not staring at pages on the floor in my house by myself 12 hours a day.

896
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I, I was offered an opportunity. It was half joking, but from a friend of mine, I'd wrestled with who is going to be competing in the San Shownessinals, Chinese keep boxing.

897
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So that became a focus. That became a clear goal where I knew input in, output out, you know, garbage in, garbage out, good training in, probably good results out.

898
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Maybe I get knocked out, but there's always that chance.

899
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And the reason this is important, you don't need to have a large athletic event.

900
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:57.000
What, what I've realized I accidentally did then, and now I always do, is much like, and I think you think don't care another way that maybe you could phrase it is not being preoccupied by it, right?

901
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And if you're an investor, let's just say you're not a full-time investor. How do you create that piece of mind? You diversify your portfolio.

902
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So you don't have all your eggs and one basket. You can do that in life in a number of ways.

903
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:20.000
One of them is diversifying your identity. So the way that I had set myself up for failure is all of my worth was set up in whether this thesis would be a success or not.

904
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And then, were factors outside of my control that could affect that.

905
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:33.000
What I try to do now, and I'd recommend this to startup founders all the time. Like, look, if your startup is the way you measure your entire worth as a human being.

906
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
There are factors outside of your control that could tank it, macroeconomic, otherwise competitive, etc.

907
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.000
You can't have it dictated by how well your company is doing that day.

908
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
So, for instance, why don't I show you how to do a very simple deadlifting protocol?

909
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And therefore, as a result, even if your company is having the most difficult quarter imaginable, if you're putting 10 pounds on your deathlifts.

910
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It's just pounds on my max. Yeah, it does. That's a winning week. And so I try to have at least three primary goals, which would seem to distract me, maybe for someone who isn't predisposed to depression and darkness.

911
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000
You can have one singular goal. For me, having say three provides me with that identity diversification.

912
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:29.000
It sounds like you're not going to pick goals that are counterproductive. I mean, you can run a good company and still increase your deadlift.

913
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
How do I say? And work on your breath hold.

914
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Absolutely.

915
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
There are all a couple of men who are all going to help.

916
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Exactly. They're all a couple of men who, and I should also say, this is going back to the meditation piece.

917
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
So, meditation is terrible worth. I mean, it needs a complete brand overhaul. It's just ludicrous.

918
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:54.000
It carries a lot of baggage with it. Another option for getting your monkey mind out of your head, so that you can function properly, is to, and we had a fun exchange on Twitter about this.

919
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But is to journal in the morning. And really, you can look at morning pages. I won't get into it now.

920
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But the stream of consciousness writing for three pages will very often show you how stupidly trivial your concerns are.

921
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It makes it concrete when you try to write it out and you're like, wait, that doesn't make any sense.

922
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Well, I'm going to take that one step further. You want to know what it actually does. Well, in my mind, what it actually does, when I'm writing something, because I now write for my own podcast, right?

923
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
When you write, you are forced to detach from what you're writing.

924
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000
100% forced to detach from it. So when I'm writing something, I'm going, you're looking at it. It's not in you anymore. It's out there.

925
01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So that is a good way to detach.

926
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000
It's by writing something down. That's another thing that happens when you do pros and cons, right? Oh, I'm going to, I don't know what decision I'm going to make them or do pros and cons.

927
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Well, all you're doing is physically detaching, physically pulling those things.

928
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
If those ideas out of your brain, putting them on a paper and now you're detached from them, and you can make a good decision.

929
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
I hate when I agree with you, Mr. Timfer.

930
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Makes the internet so much less fun or you agree. But a few other recommendations, one would be, and this is something that I've used as a coping mechanism, often.

931
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:12.000
If you can't make yourself happy and happiness as a word is really problematic, I think,

932
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and chasing it tends to mean you're not going to catch it, by the way.

933
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:26.000
But if you are in a low state or a depressive state, and you can't figure out how to make yourself happy, just try to make other people happy.

934
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And it seems cliched, can I? But it's like, look, something is simple and this is something I do as paying for the coffee, for the person behind you and line at Starbucks.

935
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Can actually have a significant impact on the well-being that you experience in today.

936
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Something like that, or sometimes I'll just walk in, I'll be like, all right, it's a Friday. There's six people in the coffee shop. All right, round a coffee on me.

937
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000
It's such a simple thing to do, but cheapest therapy you will ever have.

938
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You don't know what I do. What's that?

939
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Kind of similar to that, but it's a little bit different.

940
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:07.000
When I interact with some, let's say, I'm not a coffee drinkable, let's say I'm in a restaurant, but a 7-11, right? 7-11.

941
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I'm going in there, I'm going to pick up whatever bottle of water.

942
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:19.000
When I interact with the person that's telling me a bottle of water at 7-11, who's making $8.25 an hour, I treat that person like a human being.

943
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yeah. I treat that person like a human being. I say, hey, how's it going?

944
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Yeah, I just just bottle hard and thirst hot out there, isn't it?

945
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Hey, I hope you have a good day. I just do that, because I always see people in the world that treat those other people like they're not people.

946
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And I think that just dehumanizes you as an individual. So somebody that's clean and toilets and is coming out of the thing with the bag garbage and whatever, the hey man, how's it going?

947
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Everything cool? You know, they thanks something like that.

948
01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I think those are important. And I definitely, the way you put it in the book is if you can't seem to make yourself happy, do little things to make other people happy.

949
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Very effective magic trick. Focus on others and set yourself totally agree with that one.

950
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Go into the J, the other ones you put in here is going to the gym move for at least 30 minutes.

951
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I tell this, this is like the solution to everything, right?

952
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah. Oh, you got problems in your life? Go go to the gym.

953
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Cool. Go get a workout on the next night. Let's at least start there.

954
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I think those are those are super powerful.

955
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:41.000
You give some specific recommendations that if you're not particularly prone to working out by yourself, a couple of recommendations that you're going to sound funny, but any kind of partner or group exercise.

956
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And you can take your pick. I think rock climbing is fantastic any kind of blaze system for instance.

957
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Any type of dance. I have to recommend dance on the jack.

958
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
That's the best. I'm going to keep going here.

959
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
We're going to the black hole here.

960
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Or it could be tie-boxing.

961
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Somebody with pads interact with their fucking human being.

962
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:14.000
We like to say you're jitsu, you just involved the jitsu enough to get choked out on regular basis.

963
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:23.000
No, you actually, you got a great list in here of practical, grimland defenses, what you call it. You know, you talk about, and these are all in the book that you put out.

964
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000
All these little tricks, they're not necessarily to combat depression.

965
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
There are just things for people that maybe do better in their lives.

966
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Morning rituals. You got productivity tricks.

967
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000
You got how do you face things that you're afraid of. You got the jar of awesome. You got gymnastics.

968
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You got acro yoga, but I'm not going to talk about that one.

969
01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
But my point is you got a bunch of these things written about in the book, which I think is very helpful.

970
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Hey, I got to put this out there too, just because people are listening to this.

971
01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:05.000
If you're in that zone, 1-800-273-8255, suicide prevention line.

972
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
If you're there, give it a call.

973
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

974
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Get yourself out, get through it, brother.

975
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And if you're prone to those cycles, also one of my very close friends who, by the way, extremely successful CEO.

976
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So material professional success does not make you immune to this necessarily.

977
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
And that should be reinforcing and reassuring for people, meaning to say, the people you see on magazine covers.

978
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
They might very well be fighting the same battle that you are, something very, very similar.

979
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And what this friend of mine did, extremely successful.

980
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I mean, top 1% by any measurement.

981
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And he got close to the edge, number of times.

982
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And he realized he didn't care about himself, but he cared about his promises that he made.

983
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So he made a non-suicide pact with his brother, because he knew that he would never break his word.

984
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It was brother.

985
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Even when he didn't care about himself at all.

986
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Which is another effective approach.

987
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I believe that. I know plenty of guys, at least in my old job.

988
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
We definitely all cared more about our friends, our brothers and the seal teams.

989
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And we did about ourselves without questions.

990
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.000
So that would be a powerful thing there as well.

991
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I'm going to take it to your little section here where you wrap this section up of the book.

992
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Back to the book.

993
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
My perfect storm was nothing permanent.

994
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
But of course, it's far from the last storm I'll face.

995
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And it will be many more.

996
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
The key is building fires where you can warm yourself up as you wait for the tempest to pass.

997
01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:04.000
These fires, the routines, habits, relationships, and coping mechanisms you build help you to look at the rain and see fertilizer instead of a flood.

998
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.000
If you want the luscious green of life and you do.

999
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
The gray part is part of the natural cycle.

1000
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
You are not flawed.

1001
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
You are human.

1002
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
You have gifts to share with the world.

1003
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And when the darkness comes, when you are fighting the demons, just remember.

1004
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I'm right there fighting with you.

1005
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
You are not alone.

1006
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:46.000
There was a large tribe around you and thousands of them are reading this book right now.

1007
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The gems I found were forged in the struggle.

1008
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Never, ever, give up.

1009
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Much love to you and yours.

1010
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Tim.

1011
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Well, it would appear that once again, the podcast went into the darkness a little bit.

1012
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
And I think that's okay.

1013
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And I think that having you on here, Tim, someone that certainly, like you just talked about, comes across as out would be happy and successful in loving life.

1014
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000
And having you talk about these things and having you put them in the book is it real service to people.

1015
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I think it's the most important thing I've ever written.

1016
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Period hands down, end of story.

1017
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And that's a bold statement.

1018
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
That's a bold statement.

1019
01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:01.000
And I think the other thing is that people that aren't maybe necessarily in that boat, it's important that they learn to.

1020
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:09.000
So that you can recognize, look for signs, understand some solutions that you can give to people.

1021
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And also remember that the darkness that seems all consuming.

1022
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
We've seen it time and time again.

1023
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And it's not.

1024
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
It's not.

1025
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It is not stronger than the forces of good.

1026
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
The darkness will subside and the light will win in the end.

1027
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:43.000
So hold on, fight on, drive on and look.

1028
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Look into the distance out there somewhere and all that darkness.

1029
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
There is light.

1030
01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:02.000
There's hope and there is renewal and rebirth and there is joy and there is this thing.

1031
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.000
This amazing thing, this crazy thing, this beautiful thing.

1032
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:18.000
This horrifying thing, this magnificent thing that we call life.

1033
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Then it isn't easy.

1034
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
And it wasn't meant to be easy.

1035
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But it is worth every second.

1036
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:44.000
It's a living.

1037
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And with that, I wanted to make sure that I pointed out that this book, which is 700 and something pages long.

1038
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Actually it's 600 after cutting about 65 pages on 20 pages.

1039
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And this book is not.

1040
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Anyway, this book is not about a book about suicide.

1041
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
This is a fraction.

1042
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Was it five pages, eight pages, something like that.

1043
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I just wanted to make sure that I covered the subject.

1044
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I don't think that most people are going to pick up the book and say, oh, I'll cover the suicide section.

1045
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
No, they leave that for me.

1046
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
That's my job here.

1047
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
But the book, it's what it really is.

1048
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
It's a compilation of all the lessons that you've learned.

1049
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Talking to all the people that you've talked to on the podcast, which is a wide range of different people.

1050
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And you take in that and distill down for those people that go and listen to Tim Ferriss podcast and you go, man,

1051
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
One minute, I can't give this to.

1052
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I give two hours.

1053
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Two and a half hours.

1054
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Who has two and a half hours now?

1055
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
You can get it on in 15.

1056
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You can get it the distilled version, the peak knowledge there.

1057
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.000
And that's what the book is.

1058
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
All this information kind of distilled down into nice little digestible pieces like a reference book that you can look at, which actually,

1059
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Now we're going in the question zone.

1060
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
By the way, hot seat, Tim Ferriss gets some roles reversed.

1061
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
First question.

1062
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Can I say something for you?

1063
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Yes, absolutely.

1064
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So I just wanted to also note for people who might be listening to this and

1065
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
and thinking of themselves, well, I'm not prone to depression and I'm prone to these dark periods.

1066
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.000
The so-called coping mechanisms it would use to take yourself from bad to so-called normal.

1067
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:36.000
They are also the same strategies you can use to go from normal to better or from better to far better.

1068
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.000
They're the same.

1069
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It's just shifting into a higher gear.

1070
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
That's a great point.

1071
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.000
And I use a lot of those strategies work out every day, wake up early, get after it.

1072
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Of course, I read a lot.

1073
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Right a lot.

1074
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Okay.

1075
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And you know what?

1076
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I feel pretty damn good right now.

1077
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
How's that?

1078
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
How's that?

1079
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
How's that?

1080
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I feel better.

1081
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Yeah.

1082
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:07.000
And to just put a button in it also, I have with using these different approaches for this people, maybe listening to this and still feeling somewhat hopeless.

1083
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
The dark periods have gotten shorter.

1084
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Then able to turn down the volume and the joyful periods, the zone-like periods, a productive periods, have become longer and brighter.

1085
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And you can engineer that.

1086
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It just takes a right toolkit.

1087
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Love it.

1088
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Uh.

1089
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000
This is a good piece of the toolkit right here.

1090
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Speaking of toolkit, tools and titles.

1091
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Um, speaking of the book.

1092
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.000
This ties into it.

1093
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
The book is filled with all kinds of good ideas and enticing options.

1094
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
And they all sound really good.

1095
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:59.000
How do you take and pick the right path and not get distracted by all these other shiny objects that are out there, especially because the path is laid out and you think, oh, oh cool.

1096
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
That's all this looks really good.

1097
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You know, I'm going to do this.

1098
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Do what Tim Ferriss told me to do in this interview.

1099
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And I'm going to do that.

1100
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And then you get a weekend to it.

1101
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And you haven't, you know, you get, it's hard.

1102
01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
You realize that it's hard.

1103
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You realize that you, you don't like doing that thing.

1104
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
And all of a sudden you go look for the next solution.

1105
01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
And you end up jumping from solution to solution.

1106
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And you never get any progress because you're too busy trying to chase this shiny object.

1107
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000
How do you resolve that?

1108
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah.

1109
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Is it, this is a common problem.

1110
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Uh, you have, for instance, in the self-help world.

1111
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
You have seminar junkies.

1112
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
I don't really do seminars, but you have people who go to a different city.

1113
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
If you go to a different seminar every weekend, they get all hopped up on enthusiasm, take a lot of notes.

1114
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
They do nothing from Monday to Friday and they hit another seminar.

1115
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000
It's like a junkie hitting, getting a, getting a dope hit.

1116
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
But they don't put in the work.

1117
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.000
So the way that you stack the deck is by understanding behavior modification in a few ways.

1118
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And you don't have to do a lot of reading about this, but there are few unnecessary ingredients.

1119
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:05.000
One is, if you just look at the literature, do less than you think you're capable of doing.

1120
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
So what does that mean?

1121
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.000
If you are 100 pounds overweight and you are starting exercise after no exercise for 20 years,

1122
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000
do not start off with five days a week of an hour of running on a treadmill.

1123
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The pass fail threshold is too high.

1124
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So you set it first, let's get you to the gym.

1125
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
That is priority.

1126
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Number one.

1127
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So make it five minutes of walking on a treadmill.

1128
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Two or three times a week.

1129
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Let's just say, of course my preference would be weight training, but makes an easy example.

1130
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Anything beyond that is bonus points.

1131
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
When I write a book like this, which is just a monster, and like you said,

1132
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
kind of a choose your own adventure book, but two crappy pages a day.

1133
01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Best writing advice I ever got.

1134
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Your throat, your quota is too crappy pages a day.

1135
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Don't even have to use them.

1136
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
If you, if you have, if you put up two crappy pages a day, that is a successful day.

1137
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And it takes away the performance anxiety and the procrastination.

1138
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You've never flushed you want to floss front teeth.

1139
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
That's it.

1140
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Get those, get those pearly whites in the front, done.

1141
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I got an issue with that.

1142
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Okay.

1143
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
If you break out the floss and you can't floss the rest of your teeth after you get down with your front ones, you got issues.

1144
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Well, get in the game and floss all your teeth people.

1145
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Come on.

1146
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Oh, I think we got to get people there with the gingerbread trail.

1147
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Maybe appropriate for the floss and conversation.

1148
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:34.000
But so the point is though, if you want to submit a behavior, you have to break that behavior down into a few pieces.

1149
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
One is just getting out the floss and starting.

1150
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Then the other is finishing the different components to it.

1151
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
So if I can get someone to say five sessions as my general guideline,

1152
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
make it as easy as possible so that you submit the first five sessions.

1153
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Do your front teeth generally people are going to do more.

1154
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
But you start there.

1155
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Do it for five days.

1156
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Don't do more call me.

1157
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
We're here.

1158
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
You're in shock.

1159
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000
We'll send a drone.

1160
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
You're not just floss the rest of your teeth with shoes.

1161
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.000
His boots have big shoe.

1162
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Lies his folks don't let him do it.

1163
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
So there's that.

1164
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
The other piece that is very underestimated is incentives.

1165
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000
What I mean by that is actually a guest on the podcast, Derek Sivers, who's an incredible entrepreneur and sort of a philosopher program.

1166
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Made millions of dollars donated to all the music education.

1167
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
He's a real character.

1168
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
But he said if information, if more information were the answer,

1169
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
we'd all be billionaires with six back abs.

1170
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
More information is not the answer generally.

1171
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Of course there's good and bad information.

1172
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
But I'll give you a great example.

1173
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
This is kind of a ridiculous one, but it proves a point, which is I have a friend named AJJ.

1174
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I'm a writer.

1175
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
And he wanted to get into better shape, but he never been in athlete.

1176
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Never really worked out.

1177
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Never watched his diet.

1178
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
But there he is.

1179
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
He's got one kid, another one on the way.

1180
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And skinny Jewish guy, but he described his physique as a python that it's swallowed a goat physique.

1181
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So it wasn't morbidly obese, but it does not look enough super hot.

1182
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And he knew what to do.

1183
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
He just wasn't doing it.

1184
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
So he wrote a check to the American Nazi party for $1,000.

1185
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And I believe it was his best friend.

1186
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
This is like merciless friend.

1187
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
He gave this check to me.

1188
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
He said if I don't lose 20 pounds by the end of the next month, something like that,

1189
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I want you to mail this check in.

1190
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Which would put his name, AJJ goes, known writer and Jew on the list of contributors for the American Nazi party.

1191
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
He lost the 20 fucking pounds.

1192
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Is the punch line.

1193
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And you can use sites like coach.me or stick STICK where you actually create an anti charity.

1194
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
So there's a nonprofit or charity you'd rather than doke than give money to.

1195
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
You can actually put money into escrow.

1196
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And if you don't hit your goals and they have referees and judges and so on, that money goes to your anti charity.

1197
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And it sounds so ludicrous. You could also do something simple like a betting pool.

1198
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.000
I know people who've never lost weight and they, let's say, five co-workers,

1199
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
each put on a hundred bucks.

1200
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
And whoever changes their body composition, ideally rather than a scale, right?

1201
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
But using a Dexa scan for instance, gets the pot at the end.

1202
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And it is incredible.

1203
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
How hard people will work to not lose a and then be lose money.

1204
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I know two guys who worked at Google both fatties at the time.

1205
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And one of them is since last more than I want to say 80 pounds and run a few marathons.

1206
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
But it started with a commitment to go to the gym together.

1207
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And if anyone missed the session, they had to pay the other person a dollar.

1208
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.000
These people who make a hundred thousand plus a year, no problem.

1209
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And it worked is the, is the funny part.

1210
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But incentives.

1211
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Whenever you're like, how can I change this behavior?

1212
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
You need incentives.

1213
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So give your, give your close friend who you know would love nothing more than to see you humiliated.

1214
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Pictures of you, your like fat ass, bum just making this up.

1215
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But like whatever in like your tidy whiteies.

1216
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And if you don't lose X number of pounds by a Y point time, those go on Instagram.

1217
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And a story like you will lose the weight, I promise you.

1218
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
But there need to be incentives.

1219
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Humans are incentive driven machines.

1220
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
And so those that when we're now we're trying to narrow all this information.

1221
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Do you pick one, do you set a certain amount of time?

1222
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Like, okay, I'm going to stick with this program here.

1223
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Candlebell swings at night, right?

1224
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I'm going to do 75 cattle bell swings at night.

1225
01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Do you say, I'm going to do this regardless the outcome.

1226
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
And I think you did this with podcast too.

1227
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000
You said I'm going to do eight podcasts or six podcasts.

1228
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm going to record them regardless of a hate it doesn't matter.

1229
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I'm committing to it.

1230
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So that's sort of a way to avoid distractions on other things as well.

1231
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Definitely.

1232
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
And I think it's a different aspect to that.

1233
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:34.000
So the podcasting was a goal.

1234
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But I always try to set goals where you can win even if you fail.

1235
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So these are goals that have side effects that carry over.

1236
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, talks about this until it's tight.

1237
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Actually, he calls it systems thinking.

1238
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And in the case of podcasting, he did this with blogging.

1239
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I asked myself, what can I take out of this in terms of skills and relationships,

1240
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
even if it bombs as a podcast?

1241
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
I can get better at asking questions, which means getting better thinking.

1242
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I can start to minimize my verbal ticks.

1243
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Both of which will help me to do research for books later.

1244
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And on down the list, there were maybe ten different things.

1245
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I would benefit from even if the podcast failed.

1246
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
So six was this critical mass.

1247
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I tend to do things in terms of sessions five or six times.

1248
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
That's usually my experimental minimum.

1249
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
But for a period of time, let's just say behavioral modifications.

1250
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So cannibal swings or film the blank.

1251
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Some kind of dietary intervention.

1252
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I'm going to start with intermittent fasting.

1253
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Okay, so I'm going to fast 16 to 18 hours a day.

1254
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
I've done up to 10 days.

1255
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
But let's just say I'm starting with 16 to 18 hours a day.

1256
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
A fasting.

1257
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Then I will measure things.

1258
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000
It's a very, I don't want to scare people off, but scientific approach.

1259
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Like you have to know what effects something is having.

1260
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So you can do that objectively.

1261
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Zero to 10.

1262
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
How do I feel?

1263
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Or you can look at things like number of reps.

1264
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Waits lifted.

1265
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000
I mean, I'm up.

1266
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I have my mug of tea in my get after a jocomug.

1267
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Approved.

1268
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I got.

1269
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
If I had an unapproved egg.

1270
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Look at all these knives on the table.

1271
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
But I have this one of my training logs right here.

1272
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I've had these training logs since I was 16.

1273
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So I like to treat most of my behavioral experiments.

1274
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Exercise experiments.

1275
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Dieter experiments as a two-week experiment.

1276
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
And that's the minimal effective dose that I'll use in cases like that.

1277
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And I'll always do the fewest number of things possible.

1278
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.000
So let's just say you have your readable like this or any other book.

1279
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I think I take the opposite approach.

1280
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I'm unfortunately probably bad.

1281
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I'll just go as many as I can possibly get it done.

1282
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So for those of you who don't know,

1283
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Jocco is a cyborg.

1284
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
He's a robot.

1285
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
But no, I'm actually just an idiot.

1286
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Poorly program for robot.

1287
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
But the reason here's how I think about it.

1288
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000
When I'm looking at goals or I'm looking at behaviors,

1289
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I ask myself, all right, I'm really enthusiastic.

1290
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I've the list of 40 things that I might do.

1291
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Which of these, if done well,

1292
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
will make the others irrelevant or unnecessary?

1293
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I'm looking for a lead domino.

1294
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Which of these will make all of the rest irrelevant,

1295
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
meaning I don't need to do them or easier?

1296
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And that is how I choose the behaviors or the goals to focus on.

1297
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And then once I have those, just so I can control my variables

1298
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
to the extent possible.

1299
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So I'm changing my diet and six different exercise routines

1300
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
and my sleep all at the same time.

1301
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I may not know which is contributing to higher reps in the kettlebell swing.

1302
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Maybe the kettlebell swing is killing me,

1303
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
but because I fixed my diet.

1304
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I'm actually recovering properly.

1305
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
So you don't have to dig it to that level.

1306
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
BJ fog, F-O-G-G is done some very interesting work in this area.

1307
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
But I would say, honestly, you want to get good at training yourself

1308
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
and try.

1309
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I think this is going to sound ridiculous.

1310
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And it gives kind of ridiculous.

1311
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Take a dog training course or train a chicken.

1312
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Chickens are the most interesting because they don't respond

1313
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
to negative reinforcement.

1314
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
But maybe that's not Jocco's way.

1315
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
You need something you can like hit with a lash.

1316
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I don't know what that would be.

1317
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
What do you choose?

1318
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Or warrants.

1319
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Or warrants.

1320
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
So if you train a chicken, clearly not,

1321
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I didn't even know that was actually a thing.

1322
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Well, so it is a litmus test.

1323
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000
There's a couple that I'm blanking on their name right now,

1324
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.000
who trained more than 1,500 species for espionage purposes at one point.

1325
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And they started as marine mammal trainers.

1326
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
So they were training dolphins, orcas, etc.

1327
01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
And you can't just roll up a newspaper and bat or gun hit it on the head

1328
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
for a lot of reasons, but it doesn't work.

1329
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So they have to use a positive reinforcement.

1330
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
And we really get into the weeds with this.

1331
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
But they also use a reward marker, which we're a bridge,

1332
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
which is a clicker in this case.

1333
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Or a whistle.

1334
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
The indicate when the animals get closer to the desired behavior.

1335
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So in the case of a chicken, you could teach it to say turn counterclockwise

1336
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
or turn clockwise to take a certain number of steps and then come back to you

1337
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
to receive feed.

1338
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
You're only using feed.

1339
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But one of the quotes that I really liked from a trainer was

1340
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
you shouldn't be allowed to have a child until you've been required to train a chicken.

1341
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And there's a lot of truth to that.

1342
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
But it's just operant and classical conditioning.

1343
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
I could really go down the rabbit hole. There's a great book called Don't Shoot the Dog

1344
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
about this type of training.

1345
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
But I digress that the point of being understanding that we're all incentive driven

1346
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I think is very important.

1347
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And then trying to work on one or two things at a time because you're only doing it for two weeks

1348
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
in the way that I, the mental model that I use, and then you're assessing things.

1349
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
And which, by the way, is why I generally recommend if we're talking about diet.

1350
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So someone who needs to lose 100 or 200 pounds and I've had the chance to interact with a lot of these people.

1351
01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And they've lost that way.

1352
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I will put them on a diet that has their three criteria that I use when I'm trying to say you

1353
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
design a diet for an intervention for someone.

1354
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Number one, adherence.

1355
01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So if 100 people like to do it, will I have the highest percentage of compliance possible?

1356
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And you could tell people, hey, the best work I've ever seen for losing weight is taping bowling balls

1357
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
or hands and doing a windspirant, somebody down a stadium stair.

1358
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Well, not too many people are going to stick with that.

1359
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So you look at the adherence, then the effectiveness, doesn't produce the desired result.

1360
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And then the efficiency of last in terms of is it, is it time economical, right, among other things?

1361
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
But the point being, a lot of folks give me shit on the internet.

1362
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
They're like, what?

1363
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Slow carb, beans, that'll make your intestines explode.

1364
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And I'm like, hey, if your intestines explode, you're training yourself to be weak.

1365
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:39.000
You need to fix your regimen. But like, be, you could throw a thousand people into strict paleo or strict veganism.

1366
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Whatever your religion happens to be.

1367
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And one out of a thousand are going to make it.

1368
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Whereas if you use the gateway drug of say slow carb diet, which is more can be net will leisure work with.

1369
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:58.000
In two weeks, let's say someone who weighs 300 pounds and has 100 delus, they'll probably lose between five and ten pounds in the first ten days.

1370
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.000
So treating as a two week experiment, they now have the positive reinforcement and the results that will lead to a credibility for me,

1371
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
where I can drive them to do more ambitious things.

1372
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.000
And step by step, that can then lead them to strict, say paleo or whatever.

1373
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But when you have to start with the good program you practice is better than the perfect program you quit.

1374
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You see this in exercise all the time.

1375
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
People come hot out of the gate and they quit four days later.

1376
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Yeah.

1377
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Really, I don't want you to talk about earlier, for me is prioritizing the next few weeks to talk about the extreme ownership.

1378
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
You know, what's the biggest impact you're going to have?

1379
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Make that thing.

1380
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Take that thing to the top of the list and start working on that one.

1381
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Yeah.

1382
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
You all done.

1383
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Yeah.

1384
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Totally.

1385
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
All right.

1386
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Next question.

1387
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
All right.

1388
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
There was a friend of mine that was older than me.

1389
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And he was always looking for the right girl.

1390
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:50.000
And the right girl to settle down with and to marry and have kids and all that stuff.

1391
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:57.000
And it never seemed to happen and the reason it never seemed to happen is because he was always looking for perfection.

1392
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Always looking for perfection.

1393
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.000
And I told him that you know, profession doesn't exist.

1394
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
And I also had another buddy of mine that was when you were like surfing.

1395
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And he was always looking for like the next good time.

1396
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Always looking for you.

1397
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
You're looking for happiness, right?

1398
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:26.000
And one time we're surfing and I go, bro, you keep looking around for happiness.

1399
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.000
This is it.

1400
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
This is it, man.

1401
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
We're surfing.

1402
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
This is happiness right now.

1403
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Do you ever feel like you're searching too much and looking for something?

1404
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Instead of enjoying what you have.

1405
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Ten years ago I would have said yes.

1406
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Right now I feel like I've found a few things, meaning realizations.

1407
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And I view my job as testing things on the fringe and reporting back.

1408
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
It's like half.

1409
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:15.000
If no botanist might be eaten by cannibals plus a little bit of athletic stupidity.

1410
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And really trying to find the things that the extremes, so I can inform the mean.

1411
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And as an experimentalist or an experimenter, I view that as my responsibility, my job.

1412
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And I've also replaced a number of words in my life.

1413
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:36.000
So we used happiness because it's just the easiest reference point for a lot of folks.

1414
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:41.000
I think that the better word is excitement.

1415
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.000
So I chase what excites me.

1416
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Now that's a razor's edge.

1417
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
You gotta be careful with.

1418
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But when I say excite, it means I wake up excited and I go to bed exhausted.

1419
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Basically is what that means.

1420
01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And I've also realized that there are things to optimize and their things to saver.

1421
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And I don't have a lot of trouble with that.

1422
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Most people would think that I'm just like speed reading poetry and watching every movie on like 28x forward with subtitles.

1423
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Just a cram in as much Mr. Robot as I can or whatever.

1424
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:27.000
And no, I feel like I am increasingly better at the appreciation portion of the equation.

1425
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
The achievement I've always been, I wouldn't say hard-wired for but very well trained for.

1426
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I'm good at putting goals in the sights and achieving those goals.

1427
01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But if you're constantly looking for the next thing, whether it's the next goal or it's the next girl or it's the next high,

1428
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
then you are never going to be operating in the present tense.

1429
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Was there something that you said 10 years ago if I would ask you this, you would have probably been on your heels a little bit?

1430
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Is there something that happened or you said, you know what, what did I just, you know,

1431
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000
did you get home from a trip one time and say, what did I just do or what, what did I just do or what,

1432
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I can tell you what I can tell you.

1433
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:11.000
I can tell you that it was, so this is related to something that Robert Rodriguez,

1434
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
who's the director, producer, writer, musician, everything's fascinating guy.

1435
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Also huge, I didn't realize how big he was.

1436
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So since city, good on the list, right, he has a lot of hits.

1437
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And he said, I always find it funny and a paraphrasing here.

1438
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
But he's one of the longer chapters in the book.

1439
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000
He said, I always find a funny one, filmmakers come up to me, brand new filmmakers and they say,

1440
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
nothing went the way it was supposed to go.

1441
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Like this happened and that happened and shit broke and then we missed this shot and

1442
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I don't know.

1443
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And he said, they don't realize that that's their job that nothing is going to work.

1444
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Like if you're the director, your job is nothing's going to work.

1445
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
So at one point, I was feeling maybe excessentially scattered.

1446
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000
I was like, well, I'm trying all these different things and doing all these different experiments.

1447
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And one of them I'm going to figure out my thing.

1448
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.000
And then at some point someone just said, no, your thing is going meta.

1449
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Like your thing is doing these types of experiments.

1450
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:16.000
And what I realized is my one thing is learning things quickly.

1451
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And whether that is cooking or sniping or thinking something.

1452
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And then the vaping of taking some sniping courses, that's the separate story.

1453
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Rally car racing, whatever.

1454
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Right, tango doesn't matter.

1455
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
That the approach to deconstructing these things and learning them quickly compounds.

1456
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.000
So if I get better or want to get better the next, doesn't matter what the subject area is.

1457
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
So that's my one thing.

1458
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And it just gave me great peace of mind.

1459
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Hey, you don't need one thing in a traditionally defined sense.

1460
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Maybe your thing is as I have found, you know,

1461
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
being a human-geny-picking, trying to train people to be better learners is my one thing.

1462
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000
And that made me feel more confident in this sort of experimental approach.

1463
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I don't have 10 year plans.

1464
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And I used to that used to bother me a lot.

1465
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I no longer remotely bothered by that.

1466
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Because I have two week experiments and I have six month projects.

1467
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And if I do my, we actually talked about this and you've written about it.

1468
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
But rather than worrying about the next 17 promotions, you just do what's in front of you.

1469
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
In my case, it's a book project.

1470
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.000
If I do an exceptional job, I knock out of the park with this one thing.

1471
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Opportunities will present themselves that I couldn't have conceived of six months ago.

1472
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And then it's just a matter of paddling for the waves.

1473
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But yeah, but I'm a lot better at appreciation than I was a long, say, 10 years ago.

1474
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Because a 10 years ago, it didn't matter how, how one lighted what I won, what I accomplished.

1475
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I was always obsessing on the next thing.

1476
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.000
I never took the time to actually enjoy it.

1477
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Good lesson.

1478
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.000
All right.

1479
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And this is almost down the same line of thinking.

1480
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
So we, I kind of see you as the king of outsourcing, right?

1481
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:11.000
But for me, my whole life, I was doing a job that I absolutely loved.

1482
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000
A job that I wouldn't outsource to anybody.

1483
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Ever.

1484
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
And I feel like I was really lucky and even right now, I got to do this podcast.

1485
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
You know what?

1486
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I love doing this podcast.

1487
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
And people have sent me, hey, we can help you, you know, set up for it and help you.

1488
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000
You know, I, I would read books for you and give you notes.

1489
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I'm like, no, I don't want you to help me read books and give me notes.

1490
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I'm doing that.

1491
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000
That's what I'm doing.

1492
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
So is there a job that would satisfy me?

1493
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Would satisfy you that you said it?

1494
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Well, let me ask you this, what jobs do you do that you took?

1495
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I owe this thing.

1496
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I'm not going to let anybody else do it.

1497
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
The podcast, for instance, my favorite part of bookwriting without the bookwriting.

1498
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
It's fantastic.

1499
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
And nobody is trying.

1500
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
I don't have some like suit who's paid to manage the bottom line.

1501
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
It was with no creative bone.

1502
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
His body trying to tell me how the podcast should be run.

1503
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
It's fantastic.

1504
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
So I think that the podcast I could see doing indefinitely.

1505
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
And there are many things like that for me.

1506
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
I mean, I could see doing, well, I'll give an example just because I have to take the opportunity to talk about

1507
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Tang and on the jack of podcasts.

1508
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Just a shafie or not.

1509
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000
We'll have it this out.

1510
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
So the reason I stopped doing it, I mean, I got to, got to the World Championships.

1511
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
But the reason I stood up with what?

1512
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
I was a semi-finalist of the World Championships.

1513
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I don't even know.

1514
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I can't imagine what the World Championships in Tang and on the other hand.

1515
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I don't think it's a dance book.

1516
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
How do you attack the other people?

1517
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Like how do you get them out of the arena?

1518
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
How do you deal with it?

1519
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
What happens?

1520
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
It's, well, it's very delicate.

1521
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
So this points are something?

1522
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Yeah, their judge is so.

1523
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And it's just like, like, a diving competition.

1524
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
It's a zero to ten or something.

1525
01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:01.000
But the point being, I stopped because I left an environment in which it was highly competitive.

1526
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
I went from Argentina where there are dozens, hundreds of World Class dancers to the US,

1527
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
where there's just our, there's like a handful of right.

1528
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Oh, it's, it's, it's Bob again.

1529
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Okay.

1530
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Great.

1531
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:23.000
So the, the, the one thing, honestly, is teaching people to test assumptions and become better learners.

1532
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
That's it.

1533
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
That's my thing.

1534
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
So that's the one thing.

1535
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That's the constant through all the books through the podcast.

1536
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Don't believe everything you think detached to your word right?

1537
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Assess and test the assumptions and get better at getting better, ultimately.

1538
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
That's it for me.

1539
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.000
But I, there are many things that I do now that I could see doing for a very, very long decades for sure, including the podcast.

1540
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Good.

1541
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
The other podcast, we, we were talking about this earlier.

1542
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:57.000
The great thing about the podcast is, is that you can do whatever you want.

1543
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Oh, yeah, it can be three minutes long, it can be three hours, it can be 30 hours long.

1544
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
You can talk about whatever you want.

1545
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
No one's going to, just do what you want.

1546
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And that's, and if you've written a book, the amount of other people that start to weigh in on that thing, it's, it's, it's, can be a little bit.

1547
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:20.000
That's not oppressive, but it's just, not as nice as, hey, I'm going to turn this on and do whatever I want, which is a good feeling.

1548
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
All right.

1549
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And, and speaking of doing whatever you want.

1550
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And I know that's kind of you set your life up, which is awesome.

1551
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:37.000
But to take that, that notion to the extreme, if you got,

1552
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:45.000
diagnosed with a horrible disease, and I try to think of a better way to ask you this question, which isn't like, majorly depressing, because this is, but if you got,

1553
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:58.000
you're going to have to diagnose with a disease that was going to kill you in a year or 18 months, what would you do with those months?

1554
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:07.000
So I roleplay this all the time, not, not because I wanted to dwell in the darkness, but this is part of the rehearsing, the worst case scenario.

1555
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
So not only do I rehearse this for myself, but I try to spend time around people who are going to die.

1556
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And when I get back to the Bay Area, I actually want to volunteer in a hospice center to contend with that.

1557
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
There are few things.

1558
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:24.000
So I would get my affairs in order relatively quickly.

1559
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
They're already largely in order so that my family would be taken care of.

1560
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And to be honest, and there aren't many points in my life where I could say this, I would largely keep doing what I'm doing, honestly.

1561
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I think that I stopped, for instance, the tech investing about two years ago, because I felt like I was replaceable.

1562
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I felt like if I, in a sense, didn't participate, there were a hundred other people in line who were going to step up and write a check.

1563
01:41:53.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And that wasn't a unique opportunity, nor a unique skill that I held to hopefully put into the world to benefit people in some way.

1564
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:12.000
But the ludicrous experiments, some more practical than others, and the podcasting and so on.

1565
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I feel like I'm putting out the best work that I can.

1566
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And I think I'd keep doing it.

1567
01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I'd certainly end in the last few years, after reading an essay, I think it's called the Tale End by Tim Urban on Wait but Why about how effectively by the time you're 18 and leave the house.

1568
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
You've spent 80% of the total hours you ever spend with your parents.

1569
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I've reorganized my calendar, my year to spend a lot more time with my family, meaning my parents and my brother.

1570
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And I think I'd keep doing what I'm doing, honestly, until I slipped, you know, and up in a pile of dust, which is where we're all in and up.

1571
01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
We're ahead sooner or later, exactly.

1572
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000
And I was listening, I keep wanting to do this.

1573
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I want to when I'm listening to certain podcasts, sometimes I want to just live tweet, like when I'm having thoughts about them.

1574
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:17.000
And I do with rogue and sometimes I go, man, I should just be live tweeting this, because sometimes when he had who do you have, when he had Sam Harrison,

1575
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
I was just, there were so many things that they were saying that were just hilarious to me.

1576
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.000
And I want to just live tweet, but when you had shake or a lawn, at one point, I can't remember his quote.

1577
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000
This, when you got to this topic, and, you know, used, you know, of what you would do, and it wasn't the same question, it was, but it was somewhere in the same thing.

1578
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Maybe it was about money, you got enough money now, or something, something along those lines, and kind of at the same time, you know, he says, he says something like, you know, just imagine being able to spend all this time with your family.

1579
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.000
And then you said at the same time, cocaine in horse.

1580
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I was like, I wanted to live tweet down, like, that's cold.

1581
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Yeah, Shay and I had spent a couple of days together in toss, and which just for those people who don't have any context, he's also raised church of laudity, saying, you know, more men, you talk, and so I was like, cocaine in horse, which is the nature of my podcast.

1582
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It's a little thing, it's a little bit. That was another one I wanted to live through, because he was saying to some really classic lines, and so on as well.

1583
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
All right, normal day to day, okay?

1584
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
No imminent death that I just placed in what you're healed, my son. Thank you.

1585
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Demons, notice, it seems like you've gone through your life, going from all these different hobbies you talked to.

1586
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Talk about jiu-jitsu, you do wrestle, you did judo when you were in Japan. You're talking, we show up here, you're talking about archery, right? You got all these different things going on.

1587
01:44:51.000 --> 01:45:00.000
For me, I've only had a couple things that have made me feel that way, that thing, right?

1588
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Number one is combat. That's good as it gets.

1589
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:13.000
For me, jiu-jitsu is the next thing down. It's this empty brain, and just awesomeness, and surfing is up there too.

1590
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Maybe jamming with my band, getting it on in that way.

1591
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:25.000
How come you're jumping around so much, and is there anything that you always go back to?

1592
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:31.000
So I jump around. I had a conversation about this with one of my very close friends, Josh Waitskin.

1593
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:40.000
So Josh Waitskin, for those who don't know, he's the inspiration for the book in the movie, Searching for Bobby Fisher. He was a chess, well, consider to chess prodigy.

1594
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I take some issue with the name. He doesn't like that label either.

1595
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Very good at learning just about anything. He's also the first black belt under a incredible jiu-jitsu athlete in teacher named Marcelo Garcia.

1596
01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Who is? A deco-finding chimes in it. When echo chimes that he's wasn't put out that, yes, Marcelo Garcia is the jiu-jitsu.

1597
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Marcelo is one of the finest grapplers in the last 100 years for sure.

1598
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Which by the way, makes him the best grapplers in the history of the world and the universe.

1599
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Exactly.

1600
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:29.000
No, this is completely true. I mean, I've not to go down the Marcelo rabbit hole, but I had the opportunity to train with Marcelo and it's just another planet.

1601
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
It's actually a Josh invited me when I get out to New York, Josh, so they come on by the academy.

1602
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I'm like, okay, I know where I'm going to be there. So when I'm going to get out there, he's like, oh, we got keys and everything.

1603
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Yeah, just like surface. Oh, it's a fantastic school. It's a fantastic school. And he's applied his learning approach to jiu-jitsu.

1604
01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:01.000
He's applied it to Tai Chi push hands. He was a world champion and he's applied to a handful of things, but not a lot. He's not as frenetic as I am.

1605
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:15.000
But we've we've been a lot of time together. He's a very close friend and he said, and this is his words, no mind, but he feels like I am one of the best people on the planet at getting people from zero to 80% of a skill as quickly as possible.

1606
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:24.000
And he's focused on the last 1% getting someone from 99 to 100. So he works with some of the biggest names in the finance world.

1607
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And I think that people who are very under the radar to get them from saying, beating 99.99% of the competition to 0.99.

1608
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And I think those are complimentary skill sets. But for me, the high that I get is different from the high Josh gets.

1609
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.000
The high that I get is taking someone for instance. I didn't learn to switch talk to this. I didn't learn to swim properly until I was in my 30s.

1610
01:47:48.000 --> 01:48:05.000
For a host reason, I won't bore everybody with. I did a TED talk on why that is absurd as it is. But taking someone who hasn't hasn't been able to swim ever and getting them in two days to the point where they can swim say open water in the ocean for a half a mile, which is completely.

1611
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:22.000
These are completely possible for someone who has some athletic background. That's my eye showing someone that the impossible or what they thought was impossible is not only possible, but in a time frame that seems completely unrealistic.

1612
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So I think that's part of the reason I jump around is in part to learn, but it's also being able to teach someone in a way that saves 100s of hours and just to see their head go.

1613
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And you get that obviously then you get that satisfaction yourself when you try something for the first time. Oh yeah, yeah, there's nothing better for me.

1614
01:48:40.000 --> 01:49:04.000
When I figure out, for instance, with archery blank bail practice, and I'm like, oh my god, it's just like dry firing with a pistol to fix your like casting or healing. It's the same fucking thing. Oh my god, you know, and then I get all excited because I'm piecing these things together or oh the way that you train someone figure out their eye dominance.

1615
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:19.000
If you're constantly missing basketball shots by like an inch, you probably haven't figured out your eye dominance. It's like, oh, then you shift your centerline slightly so you're raising the ball in a different way. Oh my god, it applies in the same way to bowling even though no one even talked about bowling.

1616
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Those types of things get me very excited. I always thought I was going to be a teacher because I had these coaches and teachers in 9th or 10th grade who steered me from this very bad path onto a much better path.

1617
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And a lot of my friends growing up, Long Island ended up overdosing, dying, my best friend growing up was one of them or drug addicts or alcoholics.

1618
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:47.000
And I got steered in this other direction and that 9th, 10th grade window is what I always thought I would go back and teach. So I love teaching. So that's why I jump around.

1619
01:49:47.000 --> 01:50:03.000
But what creates the zone for me is partially just that aha moment is exciting for me. So I do spend a lot of my time looking for fertile ground. So it's a new skill set.

1620
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:11.000
But these skill sets compound. So like the better you get at learning any skill, the faster you learn subsequent skills.

1621
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:22.000
If I had to default to a few activities, I would say it's and I have to be trying to be smarter about this, but it's a physical activity with a component of danger.

1622
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:23.000
That's it.

1623
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It's a physical activity with a risk with real stakes of sometimes. That could be rally car racing, just very physical. It could be jujitsu. It could be a different martial arts.

1624
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:42.000
They tie a kickboxing where I spent the most time outside of jujitsu and wrestling.

1625
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Those would be the activities that that put me in zone.

1626
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Binacessity because the penalties are so swift and so immediate and so severe.

1627
01:50:53.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Strongly incentivized to not think of the alphry runs are going to hit when someone's trying to kick you in the head.

1628
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Next one down the list here. Now I was with the friend of my new day.

1629
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.000
We were doing some work on his car. Just like body work.

1630
01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:16.000
You're sanding and then you're polishing and then you're sanding again. You're polishing and you're painting, priming and all this stuff.

1631
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And there's a certain level of detachment and sort of for lack of a better word like a zen mindset where you're doing this thing, but you're not doing it.

1632
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
It's the same thing with cleaning guns. You're cleaning guns. You're just there. It's just a very calming thing. You know, sometimes when I just need to relax and just clean my weapons.

1633
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I think everyone kind of does that.

1634
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:44.000
But do you do that? Is there anything that you do that you do that put you in that say to mind of that just let's let you kind of relax?

1635
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:52.000
Oh absolutely. There are there a number of them. And I view them as medicine. I need consistent dosing of these things.

1636
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:59.000
The first you come to mind a swimming now that I do for fun, which blows my mind to this day because I've so terrified of it forever.

1637
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:08.000
But swimming laps, just a very repetitive left right left right that rhythm is hypnotic for me.

1638
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Somebody asked me the other day like, oh, do you still swim? I said no.

1639
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I surf but I don't swim like I swim enough my life has been swimming. And I don't swim on purpose.

1640
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Oh yeah. So and the reason somebody said why it's it's and I said bored right.

1641
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Maybe I need to revisit that. So that boredom is it can be a positive thing. It can be. So I find this is one of the reasons that I this is slightly this is different because you have to pay attention with this one.

1642
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000
But dog training. I would I would really deep with the hog training.

1643
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:52.000
And for a lot of folks, it's really monotonous. Shaping a behavior at high level is extremely repetitive.

1644
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And I find it therapeutic. I love it. So swimming would be one. And here's how I make swimming a little more interesting to me.

1645
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:05.000
With swimming, I focus on the efficiency of strokes per night. So you got a little challenge going on.

1646
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I have a game or I will look at instead of say right left breathe and then breathing to the alternate side. So you're breathing every third stroke. I'll try to do every fifth stroke. And I have these metrics that I used to keep me motivated. That's the little scooby snack.

1647
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:41.000
But cooking I find something I always hated until maybe three years ago, more five or five years ago. I find also very present state forcing. It's a forcing function for me.

1648
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:49.000
When you're trying to figure out five different dishes going at the same time and timing everything, you don't have any slack to think of other things.

1649
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:59.000
So I don't I very rarely cook for one person, meaning myself, but having groups over. We had an entire pig for my birthday a few months ago.

1650
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:07.000
And a spatch cocked for those who don't know that is as you basically splitting it down the middle and then spreading it out like a pancake.

1651
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And we just created this raging inferno in my backyard with a pig and fish and all this stuff and everybody was involved probably ten different people.

1652
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And I was not the the commander and chief for that one. We had a friend who really knows what he's doing.

1653
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000
But just one of the most relaxing experiences that everybody had had. Everyone came away from that after two days of being involved and they said it felt like a six month vacation.

1654
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:41.000
I think that this is a problem for me right in the military. You starting really early in the military. You eat for time. You eat for to get few fuel in your system.

1655
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And I'm really not a good relaxed. Let's take some time prepare the meals sit around and eat it. I'm shovel it in so we can go to more stuff.

1656
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I don't enjoy that enough. And I love eating. I mean, I love eating, but I don't ever just sit and relax and eat.

1657
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I'm always in the game, like trying to get that food down so I can go and get after it's a more any kind of detailed practice for me where I have immediate feedback is a can put me into that zone.

1658
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Shooting shooting steel. I was just shooting steel.

1659
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Yeah, shooting steel. Particularly if I'm doing any type of drilling at close distance with a handgun.

1660
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Although there are different types of feedback. For me, if I'm doing longer range, marksmanship, then I'm thinking more about a lot of my breathing and so on with pistols.

1661
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:46.000
If I'm using whatever, clock 34 and then P45, whatever it might be, the focusing on the subtleties of predicting when you're going to pull the trigger.

1662
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:54.000
The flintures and the sort of stutters and stammers that can affect the shot and then making an adjustment and then taking the next 10 shots.

1663
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
I just find that endlessly interesting isn't the right word.

1664
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Yeah, endlessly focusing. That's another thing that the military kind of screwed up for me.

1665
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Because shooting in the military on the best ranges in the world with unlimited ammunition and all, that's what your job and so you get in this mode where you're just loving it.

1666
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.000
And then you get in the civilian world and you go to the range and the ammunition costs money.

1667
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Right? You're all angry about that. And then they say, oh, you can't shoot steel on this range and what about moving targets? What about, you know, I want things.

1668
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:35.000
And you just get used to, so you see it spoiled in the military a little bit. And there's some great civilian ranges out there as well that offer the same thing that I'm

1669
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Loved to utilize. It's awesome.

1670
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Good. All right.

1671
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.000
I like that. There's some kind of a dichotomy between Zen State and shooting, but it's all in Irish flute.

1672
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
My preferred. I'm kidding.

1673
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Okay.

1674
01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Cool. All right. Now, here's here's another one. So when I retired from the Navy and got out and started the consulting business working and one of my risk of earth's friends.

1675
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:12.000
That was staying in the military for its.

1676
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:18.000
It's welfare program. Right. It's a paycheck. Right. And he, the guy wasn't, you know, he wasn't all fired up anymore, but he was in.

1677
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And so he had a mortgage to pay and kids to feed. So he just staying in.

1678
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.000
He kind of looked at me when I was getting out and I said, yeah, man, I got those to pay too, but I'm going to go and get after it somehow.

1679
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:35.000
And he said, what are you going to do with it? If it, you know, if the business doesn't work and you end up, you know, you're going to come back in and about what are you going to do?

1680
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
You won't be able to get back in my mobile.

1681
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
And I said, bro, worst case scenario.

1682
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Everything goes to hell.

1683
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Guess what I'm going to be doing. I have an RV. I will be in my RV with my family. We'll be driving up and down the coast of California.

1684
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Rating, you get two schools and training and I'll be surfing. And it's all good. And I won't cost me barely anything to do that. My retirement will cover. It'll be good to go.

1685
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
You got to back up plan like that.

1686
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Let me, let me rephrase that. If you needed a backup plan like that, what would it be?

1687
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:17.000
This is one of my favorite topics. So I would say that I have an infinite number of backup plans.

1688
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And the way I think about that is by doing what I call fear setting. So much like you just said, looking at my goals, the worst things it could happen,

1689
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:42.000
the ways I could mitigate that and the way I could get back to where I am now, if all hell struck at once, helps me to remove the fear of taking these steps that might paralyze me otherwise.

1690
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:50.000
The second part is by, say, practicing fasting, practicing spending no money for certain periods of time.

1691
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:58.000
I don't fear, I would say, the top handful of things that tend to stop people from taking what they perceive as risks.

1692
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:06.000
The other very important thing is that risk has a very specific meaning for me.

1693
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And I realized really on that people talk about risk tolerance, taking risks. But if they don't define it clearly, it can end up being paralyzing and how nabulous it is.

1694
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
So for me, risk is very simple. It is the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome.

1695
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:32.000
That's it. So most things I do, even though people look out at this, oh my god, this guy's investing in speculative startups.

1696
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:44.000
One guy in an idea, man, he's a risk taker. I don't view myself that way at all. I view myself as if anything someone who's very has taken a lot of time to get good mitigating risk.

1697
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I'm a risk mitigator. And in the case of say, speculative investing, I am only using money that I can comfortably afford to lose.

1698
01:59:55.000 --> 02:00:06.000
And for me, back up plan, similar to yourself, through my dog and an RV, gets him into a note mail, sleeping bag, you know,

1699
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
somebody's right in my backyard. I don't know if I have some dirt bag collabs and hang out there.

1700
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Good to go. Yeah, go hang out with my parents, get to see more of them. Go for run in the woods.

1701
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:22.000
While I'm trying to figure out the next step, and you had that attitude when you were taking more legitimate risk.

1702
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Now, obviously, you're pretty good to go. But in the beginning, when you moved out to the west coast, you had to have the similar attitude of, because I know I did that that attitude for me freed me.

1703
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Like, oh, worst case scenario, I lose everything. Cool. I'll still have my RV. It's paid for.

1704
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Yeah. We're good. Yeah, totally. I had that attitude.

1705
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000
I'm going to be surfboards and any other human should ever have.

1706
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:58.000
And knives and surfboards. I, we rolled deep. I, I, I, I, I, I had that realization early on. And of course, when I first graduated from school went out to the west coast.

1707
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I did not have a lot of money. I remember when I came out to California for the first time for a job interview. I couldn't afford a hotel.

1708
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:13.000
I stayed at the Fair Text Kickboxing gym on the second floor, sleeping on a bunk bed with a tie instructor sleeping above me and watched my clothes in the sink.

1709
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And I was happy. I mean, I was fully content. I didn't feel like I was missing anything.

1710
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:26.000
And, but let's not kid ourselves. I mean, when I first moved out, it was 1999.

1711
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.000
This is at the peak of the bubble. Rentable prices are out of control.

1712
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And I was making 40 grand a year.

1713
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:49.000
I was pretty free tax. And yeah. And my, my office, my desk was in the fire exit. I mean, they, they was completely illegal. I was, I had, I had, I had a pretty slick setup, but it was very low budget.

1714
02:01:49.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And, but, but really what I think freed me on some level is realizing, and this hopefully doesn't sound prickish or arrogant or whatever, but no matter what difficulties might befall me.

1715
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Whatever unemployment might come my way. There are people with fewer resources with less education who have figured it out before and survived.

1716
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:23.000
So if dozens or hundreds or thousands of millions of people have figured this out, I'm going to come out the other end of be fine.

1717
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:27.000
And so that was very reassuring to me.

1718
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:34.000
That's, that that is a good one. And move to the next question.

1719
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Any misconceptions about you that you want to clear up?

1720
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Well, you, you, you actually, you actually confirmed a misconception for everybody.

1721
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Tonight, you said, oh, well, you know, Jockel is going to train somebody. He's going to need to beat them.

1722
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And that's like people always think that. And it's just so wrong.

1723
02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:00.000
So wrong. So wrong. I mean, I, I don't, I'm not going to go into it now because I talked about my podcast all the time that that stuff is ineffective and you, you actually have to lead people and you.

1724
02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:11.000
So that was a good misconception. You pile on. I'll have to. I'll now spend another five years trying to debunk that proved to people that I'm not a drill instructor with a lash.

1725
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
But it's good. Thank you.

1726
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:16.000
No, she had it, which was, was deliberate. I'm just done.

1727
02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Jockel is so effective at busting my balls on Twitter and then everyone takes it literally. I'm like, okay, well, I, it's opportunity. But the, so the first misconception.

1728
02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
So the cocaine and horrors only twice a week, folks.

1729
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
It is, it is not disabling. That's a joke internet, by the way.

1730
02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:41.000
So the, I'd say the biggest misconception is, and it's very understandable. Look, I mean, my book titles.

1731
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:51.000
I didn't expect the four hour thing to become a thing. So the four hour work week funny story behind that. The original idea for the title and I dozens, but the one that, that I ended up testing.

1732
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.000
First was the two hour work week, which was about the amount of time I was spending managing my company the time.

1733
02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And some people at the publisher were like, it's way too unrealistic two hours a week and I was like, four.

1734
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
That's so much better as a shit.

1735
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Perfect. And it sounds like a product you'd see after like the spray on hair and before the rotisserie chicken at three in the morning.

1736
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:23.000
It sounds like a different word. So I get it. But the biggest misconception from people who have not read the book or books is that I advocate eyed on this.

1737
02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Okay. And that's not the case. I have no problem with hard work as long as it's focused on the right things.

1738
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:39.000
So I think of maximizing per hour output that doesn't mean I advocate dropping a bunch of acid and like watching your cat walk around the house for 12 hours a day.

1739
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:43.000
That doesn't do much good for anyone. So that's the biggest misconception.

1740
02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:52.000
I have no problem with hard work. I just have a whole doing something well that shouldn't be done at all. I think that's a waste of skill and a waste of energy.

1741
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:55.000
That's the biggest, right? There are plenty of other ones.

1742
02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:03.000
You know something to that you need to watch out for is just because you work hard doesn't mean that you're doing good.

1743
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Right. There's a bunch of little sayings about that. But just because you're working hard, getting up early and and you think you're getting after it.

1744
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000
You might be moving a lot for your not making any progress and there's a big difference there. And I think that's something that people need to watch out for as well.

1745
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Right. So the for instance, I think the prioritizing execute.

1746
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
People need to.

1747
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:28.000
I think that's such an important starting point. Like what you do is infinitely more important than how you do something.

1748
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:36.000
If you have a list of unimportant to do is and you're killing it with the unimportant to do is that's that's still a chalking up to a loss.

1749
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Yeah. And you're still losing my friend. You're still losing.

1750
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.000
For me, it's when people ask me about time management, I'm like, no, no, no. If you don't have time, you don't have priorities.

1751
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:54.000
So focus on the what should you be doing. And for me, you know, the effective executive by Peter Drucker is is the classic there.

1752
02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Don't worry about your apps and your email management and so on. Just like free to book that's a few decades old that just talks about prioritizing.

1753
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.000
So the the biggest misconception. Yeah, just the whole four hour stick that is my blessing and my curse forever.

1754
02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
That part. There's another reason why this is my first book with that four hour and the title.

1755
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Oh, hopefully it'll sell.

1756
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:18.000
We'll see. I also lost the Timothy and went to Tim.

1757
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Just so I don't have to feel like I'm going to cast eyes by my mom every time.

1758
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
What made you know, Timothy on the first ones?

1759
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I don't know. Sounded more official. I have no idea. I honestly have no idea.

1760
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Awesome. All right. We're getting one more question here.

1761
02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:42.000
You as a leader, right? There's actually millions of people that follow.

1762
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Right? That listen to you. That respect or what you say.

1763
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And they truly follow your lead. I mean, clearly they follow your lead.

1764
02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:00.000
We saw this with the launch of or the release. What's it called when a book comes out.

1765
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.000
When my book came out. I think it was. Yeah, you would kind of predict it everything that was going to happen to a

1766
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:14.000
team. Like, yeah, when we talk about this book, it's going to be going by. And so people clearly follow you and listen to what you say

1767
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.000
as a leader. And I don't know if you foresee this off of that way, but you are a leader.

1768
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Two questions. One, where do you think you fall short?

1769
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:38.000
And two, and more important, where are you trying to lead people? Yeah, these are good.

1770
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:48.000
So I haven't thought of myself as a leader, but I think that two terms sometimes get

1771
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:54.000
used interchangeably and I view them as very different. So as a leader, if I'm

1772
02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:06.000
looking through that lens of myself, I think a very good at affecting national conversations and steering the attention of

1773
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:14.000
groups to one thing for sustained periods of time. I think I'm very good at that. And helping people to prioritize.

1774
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:26.000
If I were to view myself as a manager, I think I have many deficiencies. And one of them would be, and this has been a

1775
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:40.000
help in a hindrance as many things are. In patients, I have extremely high standards and hold myself to just

1776
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:50.000
be a ridiculous degree of expectation for perfection, which of course, I had leads to a lot of the problems we've talked about earlier.

1777
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:56.000
But on the flip side, I get a lot done in part, I think, because that is a driver.

1778
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:04.000
That can also damage relationships very quickly. And it can in a management environment,

1779
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:10.000
it can cause hurt feelings and people to not put forth their best because they feel like they are being

1780
02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:16.000
criticized and not lauded for their successes. And in part that is because as an athlete,

1781
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I really, and hopefully it doesn't sound weird, I don't really care for sounds. We're actually in sports and in business.

1782
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
My general feeling was, I remember mental early on, said something like this to be.

1783
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000
He said, don't tell me about the good stuff, the good stuff takes care of itself, just tell me about the bad stuff.

1784
02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:36.000
And that's always been my personal policy for myself.

1785
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.000
But that does not always translate well to team environments.

1786
02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:52.000
So that, that I think is my homework that, and deficit that I've been working hard to

1787
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:58.000
correct for the last few years is getting better at managing people who do not necessarily

1788
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:06.000
come to that mindset at all times, which I think can be a big problem when it's at a control.

1789
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But that would be the biggest deficit. But if we're, if we're defining leader as someone who

1790
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:20.000
can put forth a vision or an objective or catalyze a movement and move attention in people in one direction,

1791
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I feel like I'm quite good at mitigating the risk of that, because for instance, people think that

1792
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:36.000
the haters, this is a very popular word on the internet, and not all critics are haters, of course.

1793
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Important to be able to take criticism and feedback, but many people are thrust into a position

1794
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000
where they have the opportunity to lead people virtually on the internet, which is a huge responsibility

1795
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
and I take it extremely seriously.

1796
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Worried about, say, their detractors causing problems.

1797
02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000
It's not the detractors in my experience that can do the most damage. It's the die hard

1798
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000
fans who get the message wrong. Who get the directive and misinterpret it.

1799
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.000
That is where you have to do damage control and to think ahead. So I think I'm quite good at that.

1800
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:16.000
As far as where I'm leading people, if I'm leading them anywhere,

1801
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I've always, I should say always, but the last at least five years thought of my goal

1802
02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:32.000
as creating a benevolent army of super learners effectively, who can teach

1803
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:38.000
in turn 10 additional people each the same skillset.

1804
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:44.000
So to propagate a toolkit that enables people to be elite problems

1805
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:54.000
all of us instead of accidental haphazard problem creators has been my goal for at least the last five years

1806
02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000
explicitly teaching people how to learn, so they can teach people how to learn.

1807
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:08.000
That's right. And part of learning is problem solving. So you're by definition, getting people who are good

1808
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:14.000
at dissecting problems, testing assumptions. That's where many people.

1809
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Yeah, that's solid. I mean, that's obviously a really positive thing. I always talk about the fact

1810
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:26.000
that I want to help people learn how to learn. I talk about that all the time and I've said that before

1811
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
on the podcast. We'll teach people how to not not what to think, but how to think.

1812
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Obviously, I'm not the same scale that you are in terms of volume of masses of people.

1813
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:46.000
But there's definitely some people out there that I think are following me in some way and that might be a strong word.

1814
02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000
But I always think that what I'm trying to get people to do if you're following me,

1815
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I'm really trying to get you to follow yourself and lead yourself. I don't, I don't, you know, lead yourself.

1816
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Okay, you see my path? That's cool. My path was good. I like my path.

1817
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Now, forge your path. You know, figure out where you want to go. How are you going to get,

1818
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.000
how you're going to get stronger, how you're going to get faster, how you're going to get smarter, how you're going to get better.

1819
02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:22.000
And I always think that those answers work best when they don't come from somebody else,

1820
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:30.000
but when they come from yourself. Absolutely. And I think also the teaching people

1821
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:39.000
how to learn, enabling my audience to learn how to learn. And when I say that, I mean,

1822
02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.000
ten hundred times faster than would be expected in a lot of domains.

1823
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000
That's only one leg of the stool. So let's say there are three legs. The other two would be teaching them

1824
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:57.000
to dissect and manage fear. And then the third leg would be teaching them to be emotionally aware and resilient.

1825
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:05.000
And then I think it's covered largely by stoicism. If you take it as a practice and not as something to passively

1826
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.000
ingest. Yeah. And I just talked about stoicism on my last podcast because somebody hit me up on Twitter and says,

1827
02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
do you practice stoicism? And I was like, no, I just said no, because I'm pretty

1828
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:27.000
ters on Twitter. And the guy kind of wrote back, I don't want to say he was offended. And I don't want to rehash the whole story, because I just talked about it in the last podcast, but, you know, he said, hey, what's wrong with stoicism?

1829
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:32.000
And I never wrote back. I'm like, man, there's nothing wrong with stoicism. I get it.

1830
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:40.000
But for me to say that I practiced it or even that I learned it from studying the agents is not true. I didn't go to Princeton.

1831
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:48.000
You know, I didn't study when I was in high school. I wasn't an overachiever. I was an underachiever. I was a, I was a, I was a trouble maker.

1832
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:59.000
So I didn't learn anything about stoicism until much later in my life. My roots aren't my beliefs aren't founded on what I read. They're founded on what I lived.

1833
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:08.000
And that's just, it does it make sense? Yeah. When I look at it down and people have always asked me, are you going to do marks or early on the, I'm going to do marks or early on the podcast?

1834
02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.000
And, and really all of you saying, there's like, look, Mark, as Rayleigh said this, thousands of years before I did.

1835
02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Awesome. And, but I, I would love this be all educated, but I wasn't. I was just, I went down the path that I went down and experience the things that I experienced in my life.

1836
02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:32.000
And I came to the same conclusions that these ancients came to. So it's an interesting dynamic.

1837
02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:45.000
No, it is. And I, I think it's worth noting also that if you find anyone who is consistently good at operating at a high level in stressful environments.

1838
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:54.000
The tools are the same. Exactly. I mean, if you read one of my favorite books, Musashi, historical fiction, fantastic book.

1839
02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.000
It's all the same shit. You read that. Stoicism, stoicism, synicos, my real introduction.

1840
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I didn't come into my life until 2004. So it was after graduation.

1841
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
For those of you that want me to do Musashi on this podcast, I'm not going to do it.

1842
02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Not going to do Musashi not. Tell you why. And if you've read it, you know, you can't.

1843
02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:21.000
You gotta go through Musashi to get to the end. You gotta go through the whole thing to get the end.

1844
02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:29.000
It is one of the best rewards in all of literature to get to the end. And the end, this is a, what's a how many pages of Musashi is in 100?

1845
02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
It's massive book. And it's, and you have to read the whole thing. And it's all good.

1846
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
But it all comes. And it's literally, I think in my copy because I was laughing about this.

1847
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:43.000
It is two or three pages from the end of the whole book.

1848
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
It's where we get to the end of Musashi. Where you go.

1849
02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Damn, that just happened.

1850
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.000
The other pay off is so good. And the, oh, and I'm not going to do it on here.

1851
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Because obviously, I have to give away the payoff. And so I'm not going to do that.

1852
02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:05.000
And you have to go and read Musashi. It's, it's awesome. And the ending is just as good as it gets.

1853
02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.000
It's as good as it gets. And it's historical fiction. But that happened. Oh, yes.

1854
02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Document it. Oh, yeah. And it doesn't get any better. So read Musashi for yourself people.

1855
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Maybe I'll give us like a one year lead time. And then I'll do it one year.

1856
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:27.000
The five years episode one hundred. Maybe we'll do give people enough heads up. Episode one hundred. We'll go back and do Musashi. If you.

1857
02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:31.000
And I'll give a spoiler alert at the beginning.

1858
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Because Musashi is good when you get to the end and go, oh, yeah.

1859
02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Is that kind of like the matrix? What's that?

1860
02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Is there like a spoiler at the end of the matrix?

1861
02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Oh, does it kind of like a, oh, man. I got to watch more movies.

1862
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I'm actually a more echo Charles movies.

1863
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Highly recommend, babe.

1864
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Vals of pig. That's good like a jacca.

1865
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Did you watch that up once a time?

1866
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I can't think you got some paper stories.

1867
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Yeah, I do. So I tend to, when I write books.

1868
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.000
So then I don't feel isolated. I will generally, I write late at night.

1869
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
That's what I do. I sit this up. So I can do research in interviews on it.

1870
02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I'll do my writing generally between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m.

1871
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:17.000
And so that I don't feel like I'm sitting in a cave by myself.

1872
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And I will generally listen to the same track or same album over and over again for a given book.

1873
02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:29.000
That's how I focus. And then I will have a movie playing on mute in the background.

1874
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
So that I feel like there are other people in the room.

1875
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Now, at one point, I was like, all right, I've seen the born identity 5,000 times.

1876
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I don't want to see it anymore. I have seen because I was for the first book.

1877
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I've seen Sean of the Dead, which is the comedy 6,000 times.

1878
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I don't want to watch that anymore.

1879
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I'll just watch it on repeat. So I might watch a movie 5 times a night.

1880
02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Okay, let's go to Amazon Prime. And I pull it up and the first movie that gets displayed is

1881
02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Babe, that little pig and farmer hog it.

1882
02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
And I put it on and I was like, oh, this is hilarious.

1883
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
All right, well, I'll pick a real movie after this. And then I was like,

1884
02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Good God, this is a fine film.

1885
02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:09.000
And the run a good duck.

1886
02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Anyway, so yeah, babe, I don't think you'd actually like, I think you'd be disgusted with my recommendation.

1887
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
But I don't watch enough. I don't watch a lot of movies.

1888
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
I think you'd like Narcos, which is a mini series.

1889
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I've heard of that one.

1890
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
That Pablo Escobar.

1891
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Right. I've heard about that one.

1892
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Then you're jumping into what, like, 30 hours of content?

1893
02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:33.000
That is only, yeah, you're looking at that 20.

1894
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Yes, then you're in the vortex.

1895
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
You know what? You don't want to watch that?

1896
02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Like when I'm 78.

1897
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I'll watch Narcos. Put that on my list.

1898
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Did you have any questions echo?

1899
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Yeah, I have a question.

1900
02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Yeah, go Charles, try me then.

1901
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
For the second time.

1902
02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000
You know how, like, I'm going to go to entrepreneurship.

1903
02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Sure. You know how it feels like, anyway, that it's kind of become like a trendy thing to be an entrepreneur.

1904
02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Whereas a lot of times, like, you might even notice people.

1905
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:05.000
They don't know what they want to do. They don't know what problem they want to solve or product.

1906
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
They just want to be an entrepreneur.

1907
02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Because it seems like it's like this cool, the cool thing now.

1908
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Do you find that to be the case?

1909
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:16.000
And if so, is that a good thing?

1910
02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Ah, yes.

1911
02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Entrepreneurship.

1912
02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I think that it is highly romanticized and it's easy to believe.

1913
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:30.000
All you got to do is drop out of college and the next thing you know, your Zuckerberg.

1914
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Yeah.

1915
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Any of a company with billions of dollars.

1916
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
But that's not how it works, folks.

1917
02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:41.000
And so I do think that entrepreneurship is a mindset.

1918
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.000
You don't have to start a company to be an entrepreneur.

1919
02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:47.000
And if you were to look at the Spanish equivalent, like,

1920
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Embrender to like undertake.

1921
02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
It is someone who makes something happen.

1922
02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000
And you can innovate with an company that is not your own,

1923
02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:59.000
with an organization that is not your own or you can create a company.

1924
02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:02.000
So someone who makes things happen at the end of the day.

1925
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.000
So who is it? Is it in a, are we in a boom cycle?

1926
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I think if we're looking at tech entrepreneurship, absolutely.

1927
02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
I think that there are certain experiences every human being should have,

1928
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000
even if they fail.

1929
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I do think that starting a business or enterprise,

1930
02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:22.000
even if it's a side gig that they moonlight,

1931
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000
is worth the education.

1932
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:29.000
But there's a huge survivorship bias out there,

1933
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000
and it's a great learning. So you open a barren, so to say.

1934
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000
And loan behold, you see all these mutual funds advertising.

1935
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Oh my god, they've had incredible returns for 10 years straight.

1936
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:43.000
Well, maybe they're just, let me,

1937
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
mutual funds that happen to survive by luck for 10 or 20 years.

1938
02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:50.000
They have to place the right bets of the 500.

1939
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Well, the other 490 or no longer advertising.

1940
02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
So you're getting a fall sample size.

1941
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And you see that a lot with entrepreneurship.

1942
02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
They don't talk enough about the failures.

1943
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:02.000
They don't talk enough about the vast majority who will fail.

1944
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Is it good?

1945
02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:07.000
I think that it's good for certain groups.

1946
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
It's certainly good for investors if they can play the game well.

1947
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Because even if there are a thousand shitty ideas,

1948
02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:18.000
that might mean if more people hire percentage of,

1949
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000
say, high schoolers or college students or otherwise

1950
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:24.000
are going into entrepreneurship that you get next to five that change the world.

1951
02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
At the end of the day.

1952
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:29.000
So I am a big fan of entrepreneurship,

1953
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:34.000
even though much like anything else that is perceived as high-risk.

1954
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000
And therefore, treated sometimes with reckless abandon

1955
02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000
where people are throwing hail marries when they should be doing risk management.

1956
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:43.000
You're going to have a high fatality rate.

1957
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000
And I don't view that as a bad thing.

1958
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:48.000
It's necessarily.

1959
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000
But I do think that, and this is actually a question that Brian Johnson,

1960
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:57.000
who is a friend of mine, he started a company called Brain Tree,

1961
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.000
a sold for I think 800 million cash to eBay.

1962
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
And he settled.

1963
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
He said, he said, he's a little boy.

1964
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:10.000
He, he shows up in, in Tullstein's as well.

1965
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:14.000
But the question that he has because he's constantly flooded with

1966
02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.000
various questions from entrepreneurs who want to make it

1967
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
at our million dollars.

1968
02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Oh, what should I do this?

1969
02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I do that.

1970
02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
What about this idea?

1971
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
What about that idea?

1972
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Is it an itch or is it a burn?

1973
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:29.000
And he's like, if it's just a little itch, don't do it.

1974
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
You're going to fail.

1975
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Because for the other people out there, where it's a burn,

1976
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
they can't not do it.

1977
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
They're going to rip your face off.

1978
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.000
And that I think is a very good question.

1979
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.000
And the other one, which I think originally came from,

1980
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I think about this now,

1981
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:55.000
a vendor holy fields first coach told him that he could be heavyweight

1982
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
or at the time, it probably cruiserweight champion of the world.

1983
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
And he asked a vendor if he wanted to do it.

1984
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
And he said, you didn't know he had to ask his mom.

1985
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000
So he went back, asked his mom, yes, I would like to do it.

1986
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:13.000
He said, well, is that a, is that a dream or is that a goal?

1987
02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Those are two very, very different things.

1988
02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:21.000
So I think that if you feel like you can't not do it or on the flip side

1989
02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:25.000
as I would probably approach it, if you can look at it as a short term experiment

1990
02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:28.000
where you're doing a phase one to see if you can develop any traction

1991
02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
or get 10 friends to buy, whatever it might be.

1992
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
And you can cap the downside.

1993
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I always think about this first.

1994
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I don't think about the 800 million I might make.

1995
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
How can I cap the downside?

1996
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Then by all means, you're taking in my opinion,

1997
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
the measured intelligent approach.

1998
02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Hey, yeah, throw a bunch on the wall and see if anything sticks.

1999
02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Yeah, because it's not really like the trend, the Fed,

2000
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
you know, that I mentioned, that's not really what it says.

2001
02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It's like saying, I mean, now we kind of have this emergence of like the grind.

2002
02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:01.000
We're hard and that's now that's kind of cool.

2003
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000
You know, the working, 20 hours a week, like that's kind of be coming to like,

2004
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000
you know, a Gary Vee, how you grind it.

2005
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Oh, 20 hours a day, yeah.

2006
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2007
02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:18.000
It's, it can work. I think that you just have to be careful with what I would suggest everybody do.

2008
02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.000
And I'm not sure if it's still on Wikipedia, believe it is.

2009
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Study cognitive biases.

2010
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Yeah, humans get themselves into a lot of trouble with cognitive biases.

2011
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Whether it's sunk cost, Valice, you've put X amount of money or time into something

2012
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.000
and therefore you continue to put good money after bad,

2013
02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000
because you feel like you have to make it back the same way you lost it.

2014
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Or the survivorship bias that I talked about.

2015
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.000
You have, there's a big difference between correlation and causation.

2016
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Things that happen at the same time and things that, for instance,

2017
02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
and things that cause something else to happen.

2018
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000
So you just have to ask, like,

2019
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.000
over 1,000 people who do X, how many are going to get the outcome that is being showcased.

2020
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.000
And if the answer is, I don't know, then you should be really careful about assuming that a leads to be.

2021
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Right?

2022
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:09.000
And for me, it also comes back to the adherence.

2023
02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:14.000
So if I'm trying to coach 100 entrepreneurs and if I'm talking to three entrepreneurs,

2024
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000
it's very case by case.

2025
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000
But if I'm talking to a class which I did for a long time,

2026
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.000
class of high-tech entrepreneurs, 100 students hypothetically,

2027
02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I want the advice I give them to apply to the greatest percentage of people in the class as possible,

2028
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
or to be usable.

2029
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000
And if I say 20 hours a day,

2030
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.000
there might be one or two mutants who can do that and sustain it.

2031
02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
The rest are going to flame out.

2032
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:48.000
And for me, in that environment, it's about finding first the good program you can follow,

2033
02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000
as opposed to the best program that will knock out 99%.

2034
02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.000
But, environment dependent.

2035
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Now for in Buds, okay.

2036
02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
That might be a different situation.

2037
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:06.000
If you're training dogs for say military or police utilization,

2038
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
probably a different story.

2039
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.000
If you are looking for athletes for ultra-indurance competition,

2040
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:17.000
or 24-hour plus competitions, you are looking for mutants,

2041
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
make no mistake about it.

2042
02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:24.000
But if I'm trying to encourage the greatest number of people to attempt out to

2043
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:28.000
partnership and succeed, then I'm going to adjust my advice accordingly.

2044
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Hey, do you ever, I get a lot of sleep for instance.

2045
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
People are like, oh my god, that's Paris guys.

2046
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Before I, you must get two hours of sleep a night.

2047
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:37.000
I've done all sorts of weird stuff with sleep deprivation.

2048
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I've done polyphase, excleep, where I've done whatever it is,

2049
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:44.000
two to four hours a night for ages on end.

2050
02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But my default is 8 to 9 hours a night.

2051
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I love sleep.

2052
02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
I'm sorry, Jocca, but I didn't love it.

2053
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Hey, do you ever get, like, you know, like entrepreneurship as like this,

2054
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
the trendy thing to do, do you ever get annoyed when you see like,

2055
02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:01.000
potent poses, you know what, you know how they subscribe to all the things.

2056
02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
And then they always want to talk about it and you use all the jargon, you know.

2057
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I would say I'll tell you what annoys me more.

2058
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I don't mind people who are blissfully unaware and extremely enthusiastic.

2059
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Because quite frankly, oh, I shouldn't speak for everybody, but I think everybody's been there.

2060
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Like I remember graduating in 1999,

2061
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
oh my god was I excited to get into tech and entrepreneurship.

2062
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Yeah, I remember this fact, I kind of knew a friend of a friend who sold a company for someone,

2063
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
godly, someone money, three hundred four million.

2064
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
I was like, what?

2065
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I got smart, but he's not that smart.

2066
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Yeah.

2067
02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
And it was a very exciting time.

2068
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.000
And I don't think in that, in that world that excitement can be undervalued, really.

2069
02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:46.000
I think it's the fuel.

2070
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I think it's a big part of the fuel.

2071
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:54.000
The people who bother me are the bee players who think

2072
02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:04.000
they're Elon Musk or the or the once your lucky couldn't pull it off twice or didn't attempt.

2073
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Once your lucky twice your good, the people who had good timing and now think they walk on water.

2074
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Yeah.

2075
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Like the kind of they start a course now, those kind of guys.

2076
02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Oh, they're really in different varieties.

2077
02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000
And I mean, I'd love to see them all around off a cliff like Lemming.

2078
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:25.000
And they make me absolutely insane because the best of the best of the best when you meet them.

2079
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
They don't act like Dix.

2080
02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Well, I should take it back.

2081
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
They're probably a few.

2082
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.000
But in general, they have nothing to prove.

2083
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
They have nothing to prove.

2084
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Like more cellar car Cia, he doesn't walk around with invisible lats syndrome.

2085
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Yeah.

2086
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Like me and mugging people in the street.

2087
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Are you kidding me?

2088
02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
He could destroy all.

2089
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
He just doesn't.

2090
02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
He's so far above it.

2091
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000
He doesn't care.

2092
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
These are nice.

2093
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Got to begin with.

2094
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
But yeah, the folks who walk around a lot of attitude in our country.

2095
02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
A lot of attitude and are acting.

2096
02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Here's the description entitled.

2097
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:57.000
People who feel like the world owes them something.

2098
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Those people make me insane.

2099
02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And there's a lot of instillate kind of value.

2100
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000
That's part of the reason I stopped all of my early stage tech investing two years ago.

2101
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I was like, I'm out.

2102
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
This is no fun anymore.

2103
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
For a lot of reasons, but that was one of them.

2104
02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:14.000
I was like, I'm sick of sitting down people who have something sketched at on a piece of paper.

2105
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.000
And now they're asking for 20 million dollars or 20 million dollar valuation.

2106
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
I'm just like, what have you done?

2107
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

2108
02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Good on ya, great plan.

2109
02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:30.000
I know you want to change the world like everybody I've talked to today with your photo sharing app.

2110
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Fantastic.

2111
02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:34.000
What have you built before?

2112
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
Because you walked in here, like you're, you know,

2113
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
levitating because you walk on water.

2114
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Then I appreciate the confidence slash arrogance.

2115
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:45.000
But what if you actually built the entitlement is what I can't stand.

2116
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:51.000
And, uh, one of my favorite answers I ask people a lot of the time me to if you could put anything on a billboard.

2117
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:52.000
What would your answer be?

2118
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
So there are a few favorites.

2119
02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Displund equals freedom.

2120
02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:57.000
That's one.

2121
02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Another is no one owes you anything.

2122
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.000
No one owes you anything.

2123
02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
It's from a multiple time world champion.

2124
02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
And, uh, yeah, I think that, uh,

2125
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.98
by Huckercrick, a lot of the entrepreneurs and otherwise who feel entitled will get

2126
02:31:14.98 --> 02:31:17.96
served humble by whether it's by competition or by the universe.

2127
02:31:17.96 --> 02:31:19.96
So I don't have to do it myself.

2128
02:31:19.96 --> 02:31:22.96
I was going to say I don't think this even has anything to do with entrepreneurs.

2129
02:31:22.96 --> 02:31:24.96
You know, you just get people that are acting like that.

2130
02:31:24.96 --> 02:31:25.96
People that are acting like that.

2131
02:31:25.96 --> 02:31:26.96
Yeah, that's the way it is.

2132
02:31:26.96 --> 02:31:27.96
Yeah, it's interesting.

2133
02:31:27.96 --> 02:31:28.96
It is interesting.

2134
02:31:28.96 --> 02:31:29.96
He that guy.

2135
02:31:29.96 --> 02:31:30.96
Yeah.

2136
02:31:30.96 --> 02:31:32.96
My brother, he goes to San Francisco.

2137
02:31:32.96 --> 02:31:34.96
Sometimes I think he has a tech company.

2138
02:31:34.96 --> 02:31:39.96
And they, he, he said it's interesting that it's this bad now.

2139
02:31:39.96 --> 02:31:43.96
Like you have, like, groupies of tech entrepreneurship.

2140
02:31:43.96 --> 02:31:47.94
You have fanboys of posters to be a business person.

2141
02:31:47.94 --> 02:31:49.94
You know, I like, you know, like a rock star anymore.

2142
02:31:49.94 --> 02:31:51.94
It's like, oh, my tech entrepreneur.

2143
02:31:51.94 --> 02:31:52.94
Oh, yeah.

2144
02:31:52.94 --> 02:31:56.64
I mean, it's a weird environment, but I, I'm very much of the opinion that as per

2145
02:31:56.64 --> 02:32:03.96
versus it might seem, or as per versus it is on many levels and weird and unsustainable,

2146
02:32:03.96 --> 02:32:05.94
there's good that will come from it.

2147
02:32:05.94 --> 02:32:06.94
Yeah.

2148
02:32:06.94 --> 02:32:10.94
The more entrance you have in the race, just like the more freaks and mutants you're going to find.

2149
02:32:10.94 --> 02:32:12.94
And those people are interesting.

2150
02:32:12.94 --> 02:32:13.94
Yeah.

2151
02:32:13.94 --> 02:32:16.30
I'm so cool that I'm just going to wait until this blood and the streets and the games

2152
02:32:16.30 --> 02:32:17.92
a little easier for me.

2153
02:32:17.92 --> 02:32:20.92
All right.

2154
02:32:20.92 --> 02:32:21.92
Echo.

2155
02:32:21.92 --> 02:32:22.92
Yes.

2156
02:32:22.92 --> 02:32:25.92
Anyone wants to support this podcast?

2157
02:32:25.92 --> 02:32:26.92
How should they do it?

2158
02:32:26.92 --> 02:32:27.92
They do by the way.

2159
02:32:27.92 --> 02:32:28.92
If they do.

2160
02:32:28.92 --> 02:32:29.92
Yeah.

2161
02:32:29.92 --> 02:32:32.92
Twitter and whatnot, they do use the way.

2162
02:32:32.92 --> 02:32:36.92
First off, support yourself as I always say, if you don't know, can't

2163
02:32:36.92 --> 02:32:37.92
fair, say no, you know about this stuff.

2164
02:32:37.92 --> 02:32:40.92
What I'm going to say anyway, supplementation.

2165
02:32:40.92 --> 02:32:42.92
Talk about efficiency from time to time.

2166
02:32:42.92 --> 02:32:43.92
I know.

2167
02:32:43.92 --> 02:32:49.92
Shroom tech utilizes oxygen, more efficiently in your body.

2168
02:32:49.92 --> 02:32:52.92
That's what Shroom tech sport is for.

2169
02:32:52.92 --> 02:32:54.92
You already said that before?

2170
02:32:54.92 --> 02:32:55.92
You said it before.

2171
02:32:55.92 --> 02:32:58.92
Anyway, on it has a bunch of stuff that's on it.

2172
02:32:58.92 --> 02:33:02.92
That's the supplementation that you want to engage in because you don't want to jump

2173
02:33:02.92 --> 02:33:03.92
supplements.

2174
02:33:03.92 --> 02:33:04.92
So on it.

2175
02:33:04.92 --> 02:33:05.92
Doc on slash jockel.

2176
02:33:05.92 --> 02:33:09.92
10% off and supplement your wallet as well.

2177
02:33:09.92 --> 02:33:12.92
And then of course the Amazon click through.

2178
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:13.92
Christmas is coming out.

2179
02:33:13.92 --> 02:33:15.92
Christmas is going.

2180
02:33:15.92 --> 02:33:17.92
Various birthdays.

2181
02:33:17.92 --> 02:33:20.92
I'm not going to say when mine is, but it's soon.

2182
02:33:20.92 --> 02:33:25.92
If you shop on Amazon click through our website, you can support this podcast in that

2183
02:33:25.92 --> 02:33:26.92
way.

2184
02:33:26.92 --> 02:33:27.92
If you're in the mood too.

2185
02:33:27.92 --> 02:33:30.92
So yeah, you go to the website, doc op podcast.com.

2186
02:33:30.92 --> 02:33:33.92
Click through and then do your shopping regardless of what you're buying.

2187
02:33:33.92 --> 02:33:35.92
Whether or not you're buying Tim's book.

2188
02:33:35.92 --> 02:33:37.92
Tools for Titans.

2189
02:33:37.92 --> 02:33:40.92
Or doc date.

2190
02:33:40.92 --> 02:33:41.92
Okay.

2191
02:33:41.92 --> 02:33:42.92
You go buy some duct tape on there.

2192
02:33:42.92 --> 02:33:43.92
You can buy tools of Titans.

2193
02:33:43.92 --> 02:33:44.92
Yeah.

2194
02:33:44.92 --> 02:33:48.92
You could actually use duct tape to make a handle and turn it into a kettle book as you

2195
02:33:48.92 --> 02:33:49.92
actually use duct tape.

2196
02:33:49.92 --> 02:33:50.92
It's a big book.

2197
02:33:50.92 --> 02:33:52.92
You can get jockel white tea.

2198
02:33:52.92 --> 02:33:53.92
Which is.

2199
02:33:53.92 --> 02:33:54.92
When no.

2200
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:55.92
It's back.

2201
02:33:55.92 --> 02:33:56.92
It's back.

2202
02:33:56.92 --> 02:33:57.92
We're there.

2203
02:33:57.92 --> 02:33:59.92
By the time this podcast release, I think we'll be there.

2204
02:33:59.92 --> 02:34:03.92
We ordered a ton this time so you can get it.

2205
02:34:03.92 --> 02:34:05.92
You can buy the book, extreme ownership.

2206
02:34:05.92 --> 02:34:07.92
And if you don't have enough jocca.

2207
02:34:07.92 --> 02:34:10.92
Jocca does make a number of cameo appearances in Tools of Titans.

2208
02:34:10.92 --> 02:34:11.92
That is right.

2209
02:34:11.92 --> 02:34:12.92
That is right.

2210
02:34:12.92 --> 02:34:14.92
That is I am in Tools of Titans, which is awesome.

2211
02:34:14.92 --> 02:34:17.92
And I appreciate you throw in me in there.

2212
02:34:17.92 --> 02:34:18.92
Of course.

2213
02:34:18.92 --> 02:34:23.92
And just a ton of other great information.

2214
02:34:23.92 --> 02:34:26.92
I also got some mugs coming.

2215
02:34:26.92 --> 02:34:28.92
You can buy mugs.

2216
02:34:28.92 --> 02:34:30.92
They say they try to keep it simple.

2217
02:34:30.92 --> 02:34:31.92
You don't have to say on it.

2218
02:34:31.92 --> 02:34:34.92
They say get after it because that's really much the answer to everything.

2219
02:34:34.92 --> 02:34:39.92
Yeah, and you can kind of tell like because it's going to be knockoffs potentially.

2220
02:34:39.92 --> 02:34:41.92
There's like an official.

2221
02:34:41.92 --> 02:34:42.92
It's been approved.

2222
02:34:42.92 --> 02:34:43.92
Jocco.

2223
02:34:43.92 --> 02:34:44.92
They're jocquoproof.

2224
02:34:44.92 --> 02:34:48.92
Some people if they get bumper stickers, which I might mention a bit.

2225
02:34:48.92 --> 02:34:52.92
But the envelope that comes, some of them are jocquoproof.

2226
02:34:52.92 --> 02:34:53.92
That's all I'm going to say.

2227
02:34:53.92 --> 02:34:55.92
Yeah, these mugs, these are manly mugs.

2228
02:34:55.92 --> 02:34:59.92
I could fit probably at my entire fist in this mug.

2229
02:34:59.92 --> 02:35:03.92
If you get chased by a cassowary, you could probably crack it skull with this.

2230
02:35:03.92 --> 02:35:07.92
It's a very functional piece of porcelainware.

2231
02:35:07.92 --> 02:35:08.92
Or whatever that may be.

2232
02:35:08.92 --> 02:35:10.92
Or carbon fiber, maybe.

2233
02:35:10.92 --> 02:35:11.92
That's what we do.

2234
02:35:11.92 --> 02:35:12.92
What else?

2235
02:35:12.92 --> 02:35:15.92
Well, of course we have the store.

2236
02:35:15.92 --> 02:35:17.92
Jocco store.

2237
02:35:17.92 --> 02:35:21.92
If you like shirts, if you wear t-shirts from time to time, hoodies, winter coming up.

2238
02:35:21.92 --> 02:35:24.92
When you get to states, Australia might be different.

2239
02:35:24.92 --> 02:35:26.92
But they have your hoodies.

2240
02:35:26.92 --> 02:35:29.92
But yeah, shirts, if you like shirts and whatnot, check them out.

2241
02:35:29.92 --> 02:35:30.92
See which one you like.

2242
02:35:30.92 --> 02:35:34.92
And then if you buy one of those, that's a good way to support the podcast.

2243
02:35:34.92 --> 02:35:37.92
If you're in the mood to do so.

2244
02:35:37.92 --> 02:35:42.92
And as Jocco said, the mugs, I'm going to change the travel mugs.

2245
02:35:42.92 --> 02:35:43.92
Okay.

2246
02:35:43.92 --> 02:35:45.92
We're going to improve them.

2247
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:47.92
Well, we approve that.

2248
02:35:47.92 --> 02:35:48.92
There you go.

2249
02:35:48.92 --> 02:35:49.92
I like it.

2250
02:35:49.92 --> 02:35:50.92
There you go.

2251
02:35:50.92 --> 02:35:51.92
Boom.

2252
02:35:51.92 --> 02:35:51.92
Yeah.

2253
02:35:51.92 --> 02:35:52.92
But yeah, go in there and see what happens.

2254
02:35:52.92 --> 02:35:53.92
So try to be a podcast.

2255
02:35:53.92 --> 02:35:55.92
Yeah, you just try to Tim Ferriss's podcast.

2256
02:35:55.92 --> 02:35:57.92
If you don't already, probably do.

2257
02:35:57.92 --> 02:35:58.92
Most people do.

2258
02:35:58.92 --> 02:35:59.92
Yeah.

2259
02:35:59.92 --> 02:36:02.92
I'm just going to say, just past 100 million downloads.

2260
02:36:02.92 --> 02:36:04.92
Well, first business interview podcast.

2261
02:36:04.92 --> 02:36:05.92
I should do so.

2262
02:36:05.92 --> 02:36:07.92
When are you going to start stepping up your game though?

2263
02:36:07.92 --> 02:36:08.92
In a thorn.

2264
02:36:08.92 --> 02:36:10.92
Every day I'm trying to step up my game.

2265
02:36:10.92 --> 02:36:16.92
And the YouTube channel, which echo has now begun to engage in,

2266
02:36:16.92 --> 02:36:18.92
which is appreciated by all of us.

2267
02:36:18.92 --> 02:36:19.92
Me over here, I'm appreciating it.

2268
02:36:19.92 --> 02:36:20.92
Yeah.

2269
02:36:20.92 --> 02:36:21.92
So thank you for doing that.

2270
02:36:21.92 --> 02:36:23.92
There's more videos coming out.

2271
02:36:23.92 --> 02:36:24.92
Exerps.

2272
02:36:24.92 --> 02:36:25.92
Yeah.

2273
02:36:25.92 --> 02:36:28.92
So I do have to kind of disclose this claim,

2274
02:36:28.92 --> 02:36:29.92
whichever.

2275
02:36:29.92 --> 02:36:34.92
So I was going into a through a camera transition phase.

2276
02:36:34.92 --> 02:36:37.92
So the excerpts.

2277
02:36:37.92 --> 02:36:39.92
There was a small delay on that.

2278
02:36:39.92 --> 02:36:43.92
But the transition phase is over and we're good to go.

2279
02:36:43.92 --> 02:36:45.92
So we'll do more excerpts stuff.

2280
02:36:45.92 --> 02:36:48.92
I want to make another disclaimer and disclosure,

2281
02:36:48.92 --> 02:36:50.92
which is for those of you who see this on video.

2282
02:36:50.92 --> 02:36:53.92
I apologize for shopping at Gap Kids for my shirt.

2283
02:36:53.92 --> 02:36:56.92
These guys are fucking huge animals.

2284
02:36:56.92 --> 02:36:59.92
And I wanted to feel more confident.

2285
02:36:59.92 --> 02:37:02.92
Gap Kids.

2286
02:37:02.92 --> 02:37:03.92
I like it.

2287
02:37:03.92 --> 02:37:04.92
Anything else?

2288
02:37:04.92 --> 02:37:06.92
That's it.

2289
02:37:06.92 --> 02:37:11.92
Also, we did the Extreme Ownership Muster in San Diego, California.

2290
02:37:11.92 --> 02:37:13.92
It was awesome.

2291
02:37:13.92 --> 02:37:16.92
If you want to come and you're on the East Coast,

2292
02:37:16.92 --> 02:37:19.92
you want to come May 4th and 5th, 2017,

2293
02:37:19.92 --> 02:37:21.92
Extreme Ownership Muster,

2294
02:37:21.92 --> 02:37:23.92
number two in New York City.

2295
02:37:23.92 --> 02:37:26.92
Mario Grand Marquis.

2296
02:37:26.92 --> 02:37:27.92
It's going to be awesome.

2297
02:37:27.92 --> 02:37:28.92
And I'm going to tell you,

2298
02:37:28.92 --> 02:37:32.92
I haven't said it yet on the podcast,

2299
02:37:32.92 --> 02:37:34.92
because I wanted to give people the opportunity

2300
02:37:34.92 --> 02:37:37.92
that we'll already in the game and we're tracking to get there.

2301
02:37:37.92 --> 02:37:38.92
But it's going to sell out.

2302
02:37:38.92 --> 02:37:39.92
It's selling really quickly.

2303
02:37:39.92 --> 02:37:41.92
So if you want to come by now,

2304
02:37:41.92 --> 02:37:44.92
Extreme Ownership Muster,

2305
02:37:44.92 --> 02:37:46.92
you'll probably come to this one.

2306
02:37:46.92 --> 02:37:47.92
Yeah.

2307
02:37:47.92 --> 02:37:48.92
It's in my back here.

2308
02:37:48.92 --> 02:37:49.92
Well, film on the on the first especially.

2309
02:37:49.92 --> 02:37:51.92
You missed the first one, but it's all good.

2310
02:37:51.92 --> 02:37:53.92
I don't know what it gets here.

2311
02:37:53.92 --> 02:37:56.92
I won't even get into the apology in the explanation.

2312
02:37:56.92 --> 02:37:58.92
I'm looking forward to number two.

2313
02:37:58.92 --> 02:37:59.92
Awesome.

2314
02:37:59.92 --> 02:38:03.92
Tim, you got any closing comments?

2315
02:38:03.92 --> 02:38:07.92
Close in comment just to bring it back to the very beginning.

2316
02:38:07.92 --> 02:38:10.92
If you're feeling alone with whatever doubts,

2317
02:38:10.92 --> 02:38:12.92
challenges you might have, you're not alone.

2318
02:38:12.92 --> 02:38:14.92
You're far from it.

2319
02:38:14.92 --> 02:38:15.92
And honestly, at this point,

2320
02:38:15.92 --> 02:38:20.92
that if I've learned anything from interacting with hundreds of thousands and millions of people

2321
02:38:20.92 --> 02:38:23.92
on the blog through the podcast,

2322
02:38:23.92 --> 02:38:26.92
all humans have the same problems.

2323
02:38:26.92 --> 02:38:31.92
And at the very least, you have a large brotherhood in the sisterhood.

2324
02:38:31.92 --> 02:38:33.92
Thousands of people at a minimum

2325
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:36.92
who are feeling going through the exact same thing that you are.

2326
02:38:36.92 --> 02:38:38.92
So do not feel alone.

2327
02:38:38.92 --> 02:38:42.92
And that's pretty much it.

2328
02:38:42.92 --> 02:38:44.92
I would say there's some samples up.

2329
02:38:44.92 --> 02:38:47.92
People want to check it out from tools of Titans.

2330
02:38:47.92 --> 02:38:51.92
I was, it's surreal for me, but Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the forward, which is incredible.

2331
02:38:51.92 --> 02:38:52.92
He's in the book.

2332
02:38:52.92 --> 02:38:54.92
And that's up.

2333
02:38:54.92 --> 02:38:55.92
The introduction is up.

2334
02:38:55.92 --> 02:38:56.92
How do you use this book?

2335
02:38:56.92 --> 02:38:57.92
If you want to check that out,

2336
02:38:57.92 --> 02:39:00.92
you can go to toolsoftitons.com.

2337
02:39:00.92 --> 02:39:03.92
And if you want to continue this conversation,

2338
02:39:03.92 --> 02:39:04.92
by the way,

2339
02:39:04.92 --> 02:39:09.92
you can find all three of us out there on the interwebs.

2340
02:39:09.92 --> 02:39:11.92
You can find us on Twitter,

2341
02:39:11.92 --> 02:39:13.92
on Instagram,

2342
02:39:13.92 --> 02:39:16.92
and you can even find us all that face book.

2343
02:39:16.92 --> 02:39:19.92
He's a bookie, boh-ha!

2344
02:39:19.92 --> 02:39:22.92
Echo is at Echo Charles.

2345
02:39:22.92 --> 02:39:24.92
I am at Jocca-Willink,

2346
02:39:24.92 --> 02:39:28.92
and of course Tim Ferriss is T Ferriss.

2347
02:39:28.92 --> 02:39:30.92
Two hours and two S's on Twitter.

2348
02:39:30.92 --> 02:39:31.92
Tim Ferriss on Instagram,

2349
02:39:31.92 --> 02:39:33.92
and of course he's also on that face book.

2350
02:39:33.92 --> 02:39:35.92
He's not hard to find.

2351
02:39:35.92 --> 02:39:38.92
And to everybody,

2352
02:39:38.92 --> 02:39:40.92
that's listening.

2353
02:39:40.92 --> 02:39:41.92
I want to say thanks to Tim.

2354
02:39:41.92 --> 02:39:43.92
Thanks to Tim for coming on.

2355
02:39:43.92 --> 02:39:46.92
Thanks to Tim for actually getting me to do a podcast.

2356
02:39:46.92 --> 02:39:47.92
It was you and Joe Rogan.

2357
02:39:47.92 --> 02:39:50.92
You, as soon as you press record on our first one,

2358
02:39:50.92 --> 02:39:52.92
you press stop.

2359
02:39:52.92 --> 02:39:53.92
You looked at me and said,

2360
02:39:53.92 --> 02:39:54.92
you needed to do your own podcast.

2361
02:39:54.92 --> 02:39:58.92
And I was pretty packed for a time right then,

2362
02:39:58.92 --> 02:39:59.92
because the book was coming out.

2363
02:39:59.92 --> 02:40:00.92
But as soon as Joe Rogan said,

2364
02:40:00.92 --> 02:40:02.92
I have you to tell me that.

2365
02:40:02.92 --> 02:40:03.92
I was in.

2366
02:40:03.92 --> 02:40:05.92
So thank you for making me do this podcast.

2367
02:40:05.92 --> 02:40:06.92
Thanks for coming on.

2368
02:40:06.92 --> 02:40:09.92
Appreciate all the support that you've been given me

2369
02:40:09.92 --> 02:40:12.92
and Echo and the podcast and the book and everything else.

2370
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:13.92
Thank you.

2371
02:40:13.92 --> 02:40:15.92
It's much appreciated to everybody else.

2372
02:40:15.92 --> 02:40:17.92
That's listening.

2373
02:40:17.92 --> 02:40:19.92
Thanks to you for listening.

2374
02:40:19.92 --> 02:40:22.92
First and foremost to the.

2375
02:40:22.92 --> 02:40:25.92
People out there in uniform military police firefighters,

2376
02:40:25.92 --> 02:40:27.92
paramedics.

2377
02:40:27.92 --> 02:40:30.92
By the nature of your very job.

2378
02:40:30.92 --> 02:40:33.92
You are serving.

2379
02:40:33.92 --> 02:40:35.92
All of us.

2380
02:40:35.92 --> 02:40:37.92
So thank you for that service.

2381
02:40:37.92 --> 02:40:41.92
And thank you for the freedom and security that you provide.

2382
02:40:41.92 --> 02:40:48.92
You provide us and rest the people out there.

2383
02:40:48.92 --> 02:40:54.92
The troopers out there that have your own battles around the world.

2384
02:40:54.92 --> 02:41:00.92
Fighting against apathy, fighting against mediocrity.

2385
02:41:00.92 --> 02:41:10.92
And fighting like we all do sometimes fighting against the darkness.

2386
02:41:10.92 --> 02:41:14.92
You all remember.

2387
02:41:14.92 --> 02:41:20.92
Remember that this isn't easy for anyone.

2388
02:41:20.92 --> 02:41:25.92
Remember that anything worth anything is worth fighting for.

2389
02:41:25.92 --> 02:41:30.92
Remember that the battle doesn't fight itself.

2390
02:41:30.92 --> 02:41:35.92
You are the one that has to fight it.

2391
02:41:35.92 --> 02:41:40.92
Remember that there's a price for victory.

2392
02:41:40.92 --> 02:41:45.92
And that price is hard work and early mornings and late nights.

2393
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:55.92
And that price is unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

2394
02:41:55.92 --> 02:42:00.92
In those times when you can't remember everything I just said.

2395
02:42:00.92 --> 02:42:03.92
Just remember this one thing.

2396
02:42:03.92 --> 02:42:10.92
To get out there and get after it.

2397
02:42:10.92 --> 02:42:37.92
So until next time, this is Tim and Echo and Jockel. Out.
