00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockel Podcast number two nineteen with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The train station is very busy.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Tata says the train cars they are using are called cattle cars, which are usually used to transport animals or dry goods.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Every day, more cattle cars arrive and get filled completely.

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
As each train leaves, I wonder where it is going.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And hope it is somewhere wonderful.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
When our name is finally called, it is our turn to load up on the train.

8
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We are packed in like preserved pickles in a jar.

9
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Once the car is filled with sixty to eighty people, they lock the doors.

10
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Our car has no seats or toilets and no water.

11
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There are small openings at the top of the car to provide air, but only those tall enough can see out.

12
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And the openings do not provide enough ventilation.

13
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I am not tall enough to see out.

14
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So I have no idea where we are or where we are headed.

15
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It is colder than usual, this April, and hard to stay warm, even packed together like sardines.

16
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The train does not stop for any reason, so we ride and ride for a few days standing all the while.

17
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Mama, Aunt Lee and Tata try to comfort us children.

18
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Even though I feel overwhelmed, I try not to cry or complain.

19
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want to show Mama and Tata that I am big girl now.

20
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
A group of men read their bibles and quietly recite prayers.

21
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The cars get stinky because of the poor ventilation and no toilets.

22
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I don't understand why we are treated this way.

23
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The looks of panic on the faces of the adults and the cries of the younger children unsettle me.

24
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
At long last, the train finally slows down and comes to a stop.

25
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
The door is unlocked and a man in a blue and white uniform climbs into our cattle car.

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And tells us we are in Auschwitz, Poland.

27
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Auschwitz.

28
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And I don't know if there is a name in the world that conjures up more.

29
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Vile and a more evil part of human nature than Auschwitz.

30
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Auschwitz was a concentration camp in Poland established and operated by the Nazis who occupied Poland at the time.

31
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It had been a Polish army barracks, but the Nazis converted it into a prison.

32
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Initially it was used for political prisoners.

33
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And the camp quickly became a sadistic nightmare.

34
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And in the five years that it was functioning,

35
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.000
1.3 million people were sent there.

36
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And 1.1 million of those died.

37
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And that number includes 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war.

38
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It includes 21,000 Romani people.

39
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It includes 74,000 Polish people.

40
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And it includes 960,000 Jews.

41
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:56.000
865,000 of whom were sent to the gas chambers and murdered immediately upon their arrival at Auschwitz.

42
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And many of those who were not gased died of disease, of starvation, of exhaustion, of vicious beatings, of medical experiments, or of just individual executions.

43
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Unspeakable horror.

44
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:36.000
First then you can even imagine an actual hell on earth created by people.

45
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But in that nightmare, in that evil story of sadism and anguish and torment,

46
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:59.000
there are also stories of hope, stories of sacrifice, stories of love and stories of survival.

47
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And it is an honor to be able to share one of those stories with you today.

48
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000
The opening that I read is from a book called Two Who Survived.

49
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Keeping Hope alive while surviving the Holocaust.

50
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The story of Rose and Max Schindler, which was documented by Emily Connelly, and it is an honor to have Rose Schindler with us here today to share her story.

51
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Rose, welcome and thank you so much for coming on.

52
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I want to say it's a tremendous thing that you're doing.

53
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Because there are so many people that have no idea what happened to us during the war.

54
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So thank you very much for doing this.

55
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Well I hope we can share and educate people on what you went through, on what your family went through,

56
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
on what happened to millions of people.

57
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I got lucky because you were doing a speech here in San Diego and my wife went to see you.

58
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And my wife came home and said, darling, you have to get this woman on your podcast and immediately she told me and we were able to connect through your son Ben.

59
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So she brought home the book. I read the book in a day and just tried to make this happen as quickly as possible.

60
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So thank you for coming in and like I said, the name of the book is Two Who Survived.

61
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And as I always have to tell people on the podcast, I'm not going to read the whole book.

62
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
You can order the book and we'll put out word at the end of how to do that.

63
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
But you have to get this book to get the whole picture. We'll go through some of the points of it today.

64
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But it's a phenomenal book. It reads very easily. It's the language is great.

65
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
It sounds like you read it like you're telling a story which is exactly what it sounds like.

66
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That's how it's written. That's how it comes across.

67
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And so the book is called Two Who Survived.

68
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And I'll jump into reading some of it right now.

69
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Okay. My name is Rosie Schwartz. I'm eight years old and in third grade.

70
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I like to tell stories. I was born on December 28th, 1929, the fourth child in a family of six girls and two boys.

71
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
How you saw her is 15.

72
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:55.000
The two kids are 13. Their name is English names is Helen and Judy. Fischel or Philip is 11. Pet you is five.

73
00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Blim chew is three. Faye is two. And myrbear is just a baby.

74
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Mama's name is Regina or Riffka. And Tautaus name is Solomon.

75
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Not all families have eight kids but many do. My family lives in Czechoslovakia.

76
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And we learn to speak Czech in school. Mama and Tautaus learned Hungarian in school when they were my age.

77
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:28.000
After World War I in 1918, the government changed from Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Democratic Czechoslovakia.

78
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Sometimes when the government changes, the official language changes too.

79
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
That is when our language changed from Hungarian to Czech. Since now it's 1937.

80
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It's been almost 20 years in Tautaus says everyone is used to speaking Czech.

81
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So what language were you speaking at home at this time?

82
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Yiddish. Yiddish.

83
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And that's why you got the Yiddish names.

84
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Right. Trying to get trying to force me to try and say Yiddish names, which I'm not great at.

85
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Well, you're not perfect but you're great. Okay, I'll take that.

86
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And eight people in the family. Or is that eight kids?

87
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Right. Eight kids. Ten people in the family.

88
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And you say that's my parents say the Czech government is good to us. Everyone has equal rights in my family.

89
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Does all we can to be good citizens. Neighbors help each other and are always friendly.

90
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We speak Hungarian and Czech with our friends. You cranian is also a similar language in this spoken by many.

91
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Because we are Jewish. We speak Yiddish, the language of our faith at home.

92
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
My father's sister Aunt Lee. Am I saying that right? Yes.

93
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Aunt Lee lives with us. Her husband died in the first World War when her son was only 17 years old.

94
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And he decided to move to the Holy Land, leaving her by herself.

95
00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now, what's interesting about this is I'm assuming that he fought her husband fought and died in the first World War.

96
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Right. I'm assuming he fought for Hungary, which was aligned with Germany.

97
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Right. Absolutely. It was Austro-Hungary before the first World War.

98
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
There was a hundred thousand German Jews who served on the side of the Germans in World War I.

99
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
There was 12,000 German Jews who were killed in World War I fighting on the side of the Germans.

100
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And there was 18,000 German Jews that were awarded the Iron Cross in World War II.

101
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I didn't know that. It's show. You know, the reason that I thought, and I had heard that before,

102
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
like I told you before we started out, I study war a lot and I read a lot about war.

103
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And to me, you know, sometimes you hear the anti-Semitism is this long-standing thing that everybody knew about for a really long time.

104
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And yet you, this is only 20 years prior, you had 100,000 Jews that were fighting on the side of the Germans.

105
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Just like everybody else. And that's how quickly things can change if we're not care.

106
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Yes. Unfortunately, yes.

107
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
You go on here, since she was alone, my parents invited her to live with our family.

108
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Aunt Lee is a seamtrust, so she sells all our clothes. When one girl grows out of a dress that goes to the next sister to use, we call these hand me downs.

109
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We're glad Aunt Lee lives with us because she is a friend with Mom and Helps take care of the kids.

110
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Mom and taught to our raising us as orthodox Jews and we followed the rules.

111
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Faithfully, we always eat foods that are especially prepared to honor Jewish dietary laws called kosher each week.

112
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000
We celebrate Shabbat on Friday night before the Holy Day on Saturday. We attend synagogue.

113
00:12:51.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We believe strongly that God will protect us from anything bad. Our code of conduct says that the way we act in life is how we show our faith.

114
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Now, that sounds good, except for I got to this part that says, I do not like homework. We have to do every evening.

115
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I have three more years of school before I'm done.

116
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I think I'll learn to be a seamstress when I grow up, so I can so close for my family. We have a comfortable three-room house on Main Street.

117
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Our kitchen is the largest room of all. The kitchen oven is so big that I could lie down inside of it if I wanted to.

118
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
One of my favorite things, Mom and Briggs is Rybred.

119
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:35.000
When Mom allows us to have some of the warm bread with melting butter on it, I am the happiest girl anywhere.

120
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Mom is strict with us so we learn how to live good Jewish life, but she's also loving. Even when Mom scolds me, I know she is teaching me how to be good. I want to be like Mom and I grow up.

121
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Because our family has many children, every room in our house has beds. The bed in the kitchen is at the far end near the pantry.

122
00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
This is where my two brothers fish on my rear bear sleep. The living room has two beds. We're all six of us girls sleep.

123
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I sleep with Yutki and Fay and one bed. I don't mind because I am small and there's enough room. Fanny is a big girl to sleep next to her because she gets scared easily.

124
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Hi, you're Sarah. Sleep so the picture and blim too.

125
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So you guys are making good use of the real estate.

126
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Yeah.

127
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And again, I'm skipping through a bunch of this book so people can read it on their own. But really it just is such a pain. It paints a very kind of idyllic picture of this beautiful family, all living this nice, client life.

128
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You say here every night, we light the house with care, see lanterns. They give the house a golden glow and a special smell.

129
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We are cozy in warm in the house on the cold winter nights. Our water pump is a modern metal hand pump that pumps water up to the Spigget every time you push the handle down. This is a modern invention you're talking about there.

130
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Right.

131
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Because you mentioned some of the other families still had the bucket that you're drunk.

132
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We had a well. We had a well in the other house. Yes.

133
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So anytime we need a water, we take go to the well and let it down and then we bring it up and that's how we had picked that got the water.

134
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You continue on here.

135
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We have planted it each day.

136
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Most of it grows on our farm.

137
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:30.000
All of us kids help mama manage the animals and the vegetables mama says our farm is one acre, but it feels as big to me as a whole meadow.

138
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I help tend to the garden and collect eggs. Our garden needs attention nearly every day in the spring and summer to keep the weeds away and the vegetables picked as they ripen.

139
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
We also have chicken cows and geese.

140
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So it's the farm located on your house in Main Street or somewhere else.

141
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Oh no.

142
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It's right there.

143
00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But we also have a lot of land out of the village. Like maybe a couple miles away.

144
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Okay.

145
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Where we grow the wheat and the corn and I don't know what else.

146
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But all the bread that we ate came from the wheat.

147
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Okay.

148
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
So we did not have enough room to the area where we lived.

149
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So we had the additional land out of the village.

150
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And that's where they used to grow all the corn and the wheat.

151
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Got it.

152
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
You say this.

153
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Ta ta says the barnmits for the simple, but it changes everything for a boy. He becomes a man and may in turn learn a trade or may in turn to learn a trade.

154
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Once he completes his internship, he begins to work.

155
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Girls don't have a barnmits for.

156
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But they do sometimes learn a trade when they finish school after sixth grade.

157
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Many girls become seamstresses because knowing how to sew for a family is important.

158
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Most girls marry by the time they are 18 or 20 with the help of a matchmaker.

159
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Girls plan to get married and become a mother so learning a trade is less important for them.

160
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So is that where you saw your life going?

161
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Right. Just you'll 18 or 19 or 20.

162
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You'll get the matchmaker will come along.

163
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Right.

164
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Give you a match.

165
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
This wouldn't work with my daughters. I'll tell you.

166
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
That's how life was in those days. Simple, but it was great.

167
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Yeah.

168
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Peel the wood broke out.

169
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Yeah.

170
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Okay.

171
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Yeah. I mean, again, this really idyllic picture.

172
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Even though our village isn't very big, it has nearly everything we need.

173
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
When I walk down the street, many people I see are Jewish,

174
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Mama says there are about 2,000 people in certain, how do you say the name of that?

175
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Serenya.

176
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Serenya.

177
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Yeah. I want to try that one again.

178
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Well, it's S.E.R.D.

179
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And S.E.R.D.

180
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Serenya.

181
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It's right between Monkach and Ungvar.

182
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And this is a pretty rural place.

183
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Yes.

184
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I don't think I don't know how many people we had there,

185
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000
but I don't think we had more than between 1500 and maybe I don't think we had 2000 people there.

186
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000
But the next towns on either side of us, they had like 20 to 25,000 people on each,

187
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
like Czechslovak, I mean, hung excuse me.

188
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Ungvar and Monkach.

189
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Okay.

190
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And they were about half an hour away.

191
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Is that right?

192
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Well, it was, it was, I would say, 20 miles on either side.

193
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
But that was, and Serenya means middle.

194
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So if anybody wanted to go from Serenya to Monkach or Ungvar,

195
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
you know, it was like, but 20 miles, but if anybody wanted to go from Monkach to

196
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
where they had to go through Serenya, that was the only road.

197
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Got it over there.

198
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
You guys also had a pharmacy, a dress maker, a fabric store, a cabinet maker,

199
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
and a pots and pans maker.

200
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
We could either buy new pots and pans or get your old ones repaired.

201
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Repair, right?

202
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
There's an open market.

203
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Farmers market.

204
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
The farmer's market.

205
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
The middle of the sit town.

206
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
You said you had an uncle that lived in the States that sometimes sent you things.

207
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Right.

208
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And you were pretty proud to have, have things from America.

209
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Right.

210
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
It was exciting.

211
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Things that we didn't have.

212
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Unfortunately, we never met my uncle.

213
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We came to this country, and he didn't want us.

214
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I don't know why.

215
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
He, when we came to the United States, the Jewish organization was involved in that.

216
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Even though my husband's family sent us F-A-Dabes to come to America,

217
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
but still the Jewish organizations need to know who's coming, what's coming and everything else.

218
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
So they asked me, do I have any relatives from my side of the family?

219
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
You're not Mexican side.

220
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I said yes, I have an uncle who lives in the peace port.

221
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And my mother's brother.

222
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And we used to actually correspond with him when we lived in Europe.

223
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And so when we came to America, I even tried to be in touch.

224
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
And we actually did.

225
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Spoken the phone some time or corresponded, but they never invited us to come to meet them.

226
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
We lived in New York. We came to New York in 1951.

227
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And so the first year wasn't too easy, but after one year we found my husband's uncle had an apartment house.

228
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
So we got to bedroom apartment house, which was great in those days.

229
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And I used to write to them, I have room.

230
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
You could come and stay with me.

231
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
We'd love to meet you. They never invited us.

232
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So we never met them.

233
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Well, let's, you mentioned your husband.

234
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Let's jump in a max a little bit.

235
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Right.

236
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Because you both wrote this book.

237
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
You both have both your stories.

238
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Kind of how you started separately.

239
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And then eventually you get together.

240
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
But Max gives his kind of childhood, which was, which was certainly different than yours.

241
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Right.

242
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
It's pretty, it comes pretty clear that you were a country girl.

243
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
And he was a city boy.

244
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Absolutely.

245
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
So he says, my name is Max Schinberg.

246
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I was born on June 18th, 1929 and I'm eight years old.

247
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
My family lives in Cotbus.

248
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
My saying that right.

249
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Right.

250
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Cotbus German.

251
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Cotbus Germany, which is South of Berlin.

252
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Dad says this is a big city with 55,000 people.

253
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
We live in a multi-story apartment building that is filled with families.

254
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
That is why there are so many boys to play with after school every day.

255
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Dad knows so many good people and has friends everywhere.

256
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Sometimes he goes out to play cards with his friends,

257
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
and he says, my parents tell us they have come a long way in life.

258
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
They are both originally from Poland and speak Polish fluently.

259
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
They met, fell in love and married in Poland.

260
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
However, they wanted more than their farm life.

261
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And developed a plan to move to Germany.

262
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
They speak German well and enjoy the modern life and progressive teachings of Germany.

263
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Dad said it was important to them to move to the city before having kids.

264
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
So they did just that.

265
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Dad says Germany is known for its advanced knowledge in science,

266
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
innovative ways to get information to everyone quickly,

267
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and new ways to produce things.

268
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
He says Germany is the place to get the best education.

269
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So we will have the most opportunities in life.

270
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
My dad, mom and dad really like Germany.

271
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
And again, this is just, you know, this is what?

272
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
1937.

273
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Right?

274
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And totally having a great life in Germany.

275
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Yes.

276
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
He says, my dad Benjamin is one of mine children.

277
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
He says his family is very religious,

278
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
following all the Jewish laws about how to live.

279
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Therefore, he is the one who teaches us about our religion.

280
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Dad says he's pleased to see how we are growing up.

281
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
He is more relaxed than his other family members about our faith.

282
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
And likes to say, we are German first and Jewish second.

283
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Dad had fewer businesses.

284
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Opportunities in Poland, but he found a good business in Germany.

285
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
He runs a wine and liquor store.

286
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
He makes enough money for us to live in our large apartment and have a

287
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
made.

288
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Our apartment is filled with new furniture, furniture, and fancy carvings.

289
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
So he's doing pretty good.

290
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
The shenlers.

291
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Yes.

292
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Yes.

293
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Every Friday night, we attend Shabbat services at the synagogue.

294
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
There aren't a lot of Jews in my neighborhood or apartment building,

295
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
but there are plenty at the synagogue.

296
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Many of our friends go to the church.

297
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And town.

298
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
No one cares which faith other people practice.

299
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
It seems like families only talk about their faith at home.

300
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
So again, I had to mention that because religion wasn't at the forefront of

301
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
people's minds.

302
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
They're thinking about it.

303
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
So that's kind of the opening of the book.

304
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And again, I skip through a bunch of it.

305
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But it kind of lays out the country girl and the city boy.

306
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Right.

307
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000
But I thought that it was important to point out both of you living very nice, comfortable,

308
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
enjoyable lives in these different areas.

309
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yes.

310
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Yes.

311
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
The next chapter is called Wins of Change.

312
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So you say life is changing.

313
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
I don't like fourth grade as much as third grade.

314
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
It is harder than last year and other kids won't help me.

315
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So far, 1930, it is not my best year.

316
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I don't understand why, but some of my friends are not talking to me as much as they used to.

317
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Some of you even started ignoring me.

318
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I find myself mostly talking to my Jewish friends.

319
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So this is 1938.

320
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Right.

321
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000
And you're starting to even as a kid, even as a fourth grader, you're realizing that some of the kids that would talk to you before all of a sudden,

322
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
they're not talking to you anymore.

323
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
All of a sudden, we don't have the rights anymore.

324
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So many things are changing daily.

325
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Unbelievable.

326
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

327
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Within a few weeks on the way home from school, I see soldiers in the village.

328
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I've never seen soldiers before and I smile and wave at them as I walk toward our house.

329
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
None of the soldiers wave back in the end suddenly, I feel scared.

330
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000
When I get home, I ask Mama and Tata why the soldiers have come to Sardinye.

331
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Did I get it?

332
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Sardinye.

333
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Sardinye.

334
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Pretty good.

335
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
They tell us the soldiers are Hungarians and they are here to take over.

336
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Tata says there may be changes coming, but we are not to worry.

337
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
After a few weeks, I realized Tata's right.

338
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Many things are changing now with the Hungarians arrival and none of them are.

339
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
None of the changes are good.

340
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
No one knows what is happening yet no one resists.

341
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
When I ask Tata why no one does anything, he says that we have to follow the rules and be good citizens.

342
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:29.000
This doesn't quite make sense to me, but he explains that I will understand more when I'm older.

343
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Even your 9 years old, when you see the Hungarians show up and you see this kind of intimidation starting,

344
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
even you think, hey, why aren't we saying anything?

345
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Sometimes the less you say is better.

346
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
If you complain too much, you might get into trouble.

347
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
That's another thing.

348
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
All of a sudden we don't have the rights like we used to before.

349
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
We were practically the leaders of the village.

350
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I think you are a big business.

351
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Mostly all the people are mostly farmers.

352
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
And we got along very well. We had no problems at all.

353
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
You continue on. Now the adults seem frightened when I go into the village.

354
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
In town, all the adults huddled together in small groups.

355
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I watch as they cautiously look over their shoulders before whispering together for several minutes.

356
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
No one smiles and waves to me as they usually did.

357
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
This puzzles me, but I figured has something to do with the fact that everyone becomes nervous when a Hungarian soldier walks by.

358
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I also notice that people who go to our synagogue no longer talk with people that are not Jewish.

359
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I don't understand why because until things started to change, everyone had been nice to one another.

360
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
When I visit Tata to shop, I only see Jewish customers. Tata made suits for everyone, so it seems strange to me.

361
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Tata says not to worry about it.

362
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Tata also says that everyone is nervous about what the change to a Hungarian rule will mean for our village over the next few weeks.

363
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
The Hungarians make many changes.

364
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
The biggest changes for us kids is that all Jews are not allowed to go to our public school.

365
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And we must be inside our homes by 6 p.m. in the evenings. They call this a curfew.

366
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
It makes me sad because I like to play outside until the sun sets and Mama calls us in for dinner.

367
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
The neighborhood kids have become mean to us throwing rocks and calling us names like dirty Jew.

368
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Unfortunately.

369
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
One day when I'm walking and talking with Yutki, a boy calls us from across the street.

370
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Stop laughing and behave yourself. You dirty Jews. He yells as he picks up a rock.

371
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I will hurt you if you don't.

372
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
So the kids, everyone.

373
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Yeah.

374
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000
It was terrible.

375
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
It is September 1939 and I'm nearly 10 years old.

376
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I don't like the new Hungarian rules, but we are doing fine and staying at home with Mama.

377
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I don't miss going to school at all.

378
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Tonight, Tata has a strange look on his face when he walks in the house.

379
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
He looks pale and is pacing back and forth.

380
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
He seems to be having trouble saying what he means.

381
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Then he tells Mama that his shop and everything in it are gone.

382
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Gone? What do you mean, Mama asks her eyes getting big?

383
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I can see your hands start to shake as she suddenly sits down heavily on one of the kitchen chairs.

384
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I was cutting fabric when three Hungarian soldiers walked into the shop.

385
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
They approached me and told me that all of us have to leave.

386
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.000
They said that all Jewish businesses now belong to them and that we too were to leave and never to return.

387
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Tata's voice shakes. He too sits down on the chair running his hands through his hair.

388
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000
So now this is a transition from, hey, they're putting some rules on you, but now all of a sudden they're taking property.

389
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
New rules every day. Every day they had new rules, right?

390
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Thank God they didn't take our homes away. That's one thing.

391
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
The businesses were all taken away.

392
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And did that happen to everyone in the town at the same time? All the Jewish businesses were taken away. Yes.

393
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You continue on. You say life is not normal at all.

394
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
News is spread that Germany is at war with Poland. No one knows what will come next.

395
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Now we're going to witness now Max go through the same kind of similar transition.

396
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000
This is Max. It's the fall of 1937 now and after just a few weeks back at home from a relaxing summer at grandma's Swedes.

397
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Farmer my realized that something is very different. It's not just nerves about returning to school.

398
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
The adults are whispering in the grocery store lines while washing laundry in the basement and at dad's store.

399
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Even mom and dad wait for us to leave the room to talk something is not right. I know Fred senses it as well.

400
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So we ask mom and dad what is going on. It seems there is growing concern about eight off Hitler who has a hatred for all Jews and that there's a possibility for war.

401
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000
One day dad comes home from work to tell us that there are yellow Jewish stars and signs painted on the windows of his store that say

402
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
you'd in rouse meaning Jews out of here.

403
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
It all instlers.

404
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Fast forward a little bit the next day dad informs us that the Germans came to his liquor store and took all its contents.

405
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
He was ordered not to return. Fred and I are jumping up and yelling they can't do that.

406
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
He orders us to sit down and listen. He continues saying that throughout the ordeal people were throwing rocks and calling him a dirty Jew.

407
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000
He had no choice but to walk away. Dad wants us to understand that we are in no position to resist the Germans doing so could have serious consequences.

408
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
He will now become a traveling liquor salesman.

409
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And you go on or sorry Max goes on. Dad continues to try and move the paperwork along for emigration to US.

410
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:36.000
He had he had realized we got to get out of here and he starts putting through the paperwork to get out of Germany and get to the US.

411
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
And it's taking it's taking a lot of time. It's a bureaucracy.

412
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Max says here that is even more eager now to get us out of Germany. He has completed the paperwork for the entire family to move the United States with the help of his relatives in San Francisco.

413
00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Even with their help, there are many hurdles to jump. The paper takes longer than Dad thinks they should. So he is anxious. Although is nothing more he can do to speed up the process.

414
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:13.000
In September of 1938 after another fun summer in Poland, we prepare again to return to school. Fred's new school and Fred is Max's brother. I felt a mention it's all in the book.

415
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Fred's new school is called Adolf Hitler Jr High School. And he talks about how because they were Polish.

416
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
They were able to go to the school even though they were Jewish.

417
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:41.000
This is a little bit of a longer section. But you know, I've written a bunch of kids books.

418
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
And the kids books are written from the perspective of a 10 year old kid and then he turns 11 and then he turns 12.

419
00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:02.000
But when I wrote them, of course, I kind of got myself into the mindset of a 10 year old kid and what their thoughts are. And when I'm reading this section.

420
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
From the perspective of a 10 year old kid or a 9 year old kid, which Max was at the time.

421
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Really, it's, it's very hard to get through to understand what it was like for kids.

422
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
So this is from Max. On October 28th, 1938, I'm 9 years old and settling into fourth grade math class where we are working on the eight times tables.

423
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I'm not common on this day. I'm making error in multiplying. My teacher approaches me and slaps me across the face.

424
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
I'm shocked. It's not the pain from the slap that upsets me. I am upset because no one has ever treated me like this at school before and I don't know how to respond.

425
00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:00.000
But at the moment, I choose to be quiet so as to not draw attention to myself again. I will have to think about what is happening here before I choose to act. My cheek burns from the slap and from shame.

426
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Later that day to German essay officers known as Stormtroopers or Brown shirts coming to the class and call out my name.

427
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:20.000
And at my desk to acknowledge that they called me wondering why did they somehow know about the math error for which I'd been slapped. My hardest pumping even harder than it was after the slap.

428
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000
The officers approached me, take me under their arms and begin walking. I have no idea where we are going or why, but I have no choice but to go with them.

429
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I don't understand what is happening. The German essay officers don't explain anything and I decide not to ask, despite being very frightened and wanting to know where they're taking me.

430
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
They marched me out of the school and through the town never pausing or explaining to me what is happening.

431
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Along the way we pass our synagogue where people ask, where are you going? I respond that I don't know.

432
00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:01.000
We marched straight to the local jail and they shoved me behind bars without explanation. The jail is loud confusing and frightening. There are many other Polish Jews with me and jail.

433
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:09.000
They can tell by their clothes that all of them were taken from their task at hand and brought directly there. There are women still wearing aprons from their cooking in their kitchens.

434
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Men are wearing suits from their work. Children have their school bags from the classroom. No one understands what is happening.

435
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Many keep asking for explanations and some are crying. Jews of all ages and professions have been rounded up and brought to this jail.

436
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:44.000
He goes into this. He thinks that the reason that all this is happening in his mind is because he got a math problem wrong and he continues to think that for a little while.

437
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Fast forward a little bit. The officers command everyone to listen up. All Polish Jews are being sent back to Poland.

438
00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Dad says they call it the repatriation of Jews to Poland but he says the truth is Polish Jews are now exiled from Germany.

439
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Shortly thereafter everyone and jails told the march in a group and then here they go getting on board of a train as I climb onto the train. I realize it is packed with Polish Jews. There is no extra room at all. The doors are then locked.

440
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Dad says the train is moving toward Poland.

441
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Dad has to hand over almost all our money as well. No one resist this injustice but our parents faces show me how much of a problem this is for our family.

442
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Fast forward. It takes some time but we can feel and hear the movement of the engine on the tracks as it leaves behind us.

443
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
As it leaves us behind the guards unlock our train car and allow everyone to leave.

444
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Mom and dad tell us that they saw a sign as we pulled into the station and we are now in Zibashchen, Poland.

445
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:01.000
They have been relocated and at one point and he tells a harrowing story in here where his mom and dad leave.

446
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
They say hey you just stay here on the train and they leave to try and figure out what they are going to do.

447
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:19.000
When they leave another train starts to move and Max and his brothers don't know what to do but they figure their mom and dad said stay here and stay wait for us will be back.

448
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
So they decide they are going to jump out of the train.

449
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
They throw their luggage in their bags and they jump out of the train and it turns out that the train was just being relocated on the tracks a little bit.

450
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
It was going back and forth a little bit.

451
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
But the horror that forces them to make this split the second decision again.

452
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.000
You are talking about kids talking about little kids.

453
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:53.000
So now they are in Poland in the middle of 1913 and our parents decide to continue on to bread school.

454
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Bresco.

455
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Bresco.

456
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Bresco.

457
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
There is just go.

458
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Poland.

459
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
To grandpa.

460
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
There is house.

461
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
After two weeks our parents tell us we are leaving.

462
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
And again I'm just reading some of the highlights to capture the story.

463
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Yeah, you got it.

464
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
The detail that he puts in here is really powerful.

465
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
After two weeks our parents tell us we are leaving this time we are going to grandma.

466
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Shreeds.

467
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Shwaj.

468
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Shwaj.

469
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Home.

470
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Her big farmhouse has enough space for all of us.

471
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Also because the farm is in a small village out of the country there seems to be less risk of Germans soldiers finding us.

472
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Mom and dad let us know that this is where we plan to stay.

473
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Grandma's farm is self-sustaining with horses, cows, ducks, chickens, fields with crops and a big garden.

474
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I'm not accustomed to this much farming, caring for animals, using an outhouse and keeping light and light and

475
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
care seeing lamps instead of turning on a switch.

476
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Fred feels the same but we both know not to complain.

477
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
This is our new life and we need to adjust because there are no other options.

478
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
We get lessons in all farm life topics because we must work the farm to help our family.

479
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Dad cannot sell liquor like he did before.

480
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
He is now a farmer.

481
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:16.000
While we are working in the fields, hoeing, picking and planning, dad teaches about, teaches us about farming and our Jewish faith.

482
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
The Polish kids are not kind to us or any of the Jewish children.

483
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.000
The Jewish students stick together to avoid the Polish kids as much as possible.

484
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And fastboarding here is the war approaches the hostility and aggression towards Jews gets noticeably worse.

485
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
My Polish classmates harassed me and want to fight with me.

486
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
I get involved in some serious fights with these kids.

487
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Our fights often include throwing rocks into homes.

488
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
The situation has become truly dangerous.

489
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I am fortunate to have my brother and cousins close by when kids attempt to fight with me.

490
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
I can always find support and family members.

491
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So fast forward a little bit now the war kicks off.

492
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Within a day or two of the beginning of the war, the poles align with the Germans.

493
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
They put on German uniforms and want to be part of the German war effort.

494
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000
They call themselves the Polish Fox Doic and circulate rumors that the whole city of is going to be gasped.

495
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
The local people are very frightened and going doors, ceiling their windows and tape with tape to keep the gas out.

496
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
All the villagers including us stay inside for two or three days as a result the streets are barren of people.

497
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
This is how the Germans march in and take over the city without firing a single shot.

498
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
The Germans now occupy all of Poland and have taken over.

499
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
There is a real possibility of being captured during the German SS roundups.

500
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
The Jews that are caught are sent into a ghetto or a concentration camp.

501
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
My parents are frantic about this possibility and will do nearly anything to avoid it.

502
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
They have heard about the horrors of life in the ghettos and the concentration camps.

503
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Our parents are now frightened and trying to find a safe place for us.

504
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
I know I am terrified.

505
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
There doesn't seem to be any good choices left.

506
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So many things keep changing while we were in occupied Poland.

507
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
The German officers nail orders to trees and signpost to communicate their latest edicts.

508
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
This is how we learn that Jewish kids can no longer attend school.

509
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Another edict is posted in 1941 ordering all Jews to wear a Jewish star on their clothes over their heart.

510
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Mom's so's the stars on our clothes for us while explaining that we must fall the orders in order to avoid being punished.

511
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000
We know that we may have lost their lives by resisting.

512
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
We know that many have lost their lives by resisting.

513
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
The Germans are dangerous and unpredictable so we do what we are told.

514
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Many times the Germans marched down the main street near grandma's house.

515
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
When this happens, news of the German soldiers coming travels quickly to the families.

516
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
This time we hear about them from the neighbors and move her and quietly into the forest to hide.

517
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Mom grabs food and water because we may have to stay all day longer even overnight until the Germans leave the area.

518
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:06.000
While we are hiding in the woods, grandma stays in her store and acts relaxed and normal serving the German soldiers to make us to keep us safe.

519
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
She tells them she is an old widow just trying to make a living.

520
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
The soldiers must be lever because they do not search for us.

521
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Mom and dad talk about how brave she is. Grandma's risking her life because of the soldiers found out she was hiding Jews on her farm.

522
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
We would all certainly be shot.

523
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeah, this is a matter of years.

524
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
You had to have so much hope and situations like this.

525
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Hoping that it's going to get better.

526
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Okay, things will change. That's a lot of us survived.

527
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
It's shocking to me how quickly all this happens and how you go these.

528
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I mean, even in your small village, you go, okay, well, there's 2,000 people in that village.

529
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
It takes and it gets through that village pretty quickly.

530
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You can understand that.

531
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
But now we're talking about all of Germany, all of Poland.

532
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
This is before the internet. This is before cell phones.

533
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
This is word of mouth and people nailing edicts to trees.

534
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And this transition from this idyllic situation for both your families and for the Jews and these situations to this horror in a matter of a couple of years.

535
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Right. Unbelievable.

536
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Well, this was going on. Nobody, nobody said a word. The whole world was quiet.

537
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Where was the world when this was going on?

538
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:47.000
On a personal level. What was it like with, you know, a little Christian girl, a little girl that you knew that you played with.

539
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And then one day, she doesn't play with you.

540
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Right. She started calling us dirty Jew, throwing rocks at us.

541
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
They didn't want to have anything to do with us.

542
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
And before that, most of the people made a living from the Jews.

543
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
They all worked for us because they're all in business, the Jewish people.

544
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
So now we just have to hope that things will get better.

545
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:27.000
The non-resisting in both your parents and Max's parents both are look.

546
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
We got to just do what we're told right now.

547
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
We have no choice.

548
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
And the reason is because the otherwise it's almost like an immediate execution.

549
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Right.

550
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
This is, it's so hard to believe what we went through.

551
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
It's really hard for anybody to believe what we went through.

552
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:56.000
But it's so horrible, horrible, what happened.

553
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Going back to, you want to hear parts in the book.

554
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
In 1941, I'm nearly 11 years old and there's another new rule.

555
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
We must wear a gold star of David on our sleeve, so everyone will know we're Jewish.

556
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I don't understand why only Jewish people have to wear an identifying patch and follow special rules.

557
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
A few months later, another change comes into our family.

558
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
On Sunday, the men and boys are that are old enough, are rounded up by soldiers and loaded on the trucks.

559
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
That includes Tata and Fiscal.

560
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
They are driven out of town and as I watch the truck pull out of sight, I wonder where they are taking them.

561
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
A few days later, when the men haven't returned,

562
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I hear women in the village questioning aloud to one another if the men are ever coming back.

563
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Tata will find a way to come home to us.

564
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I know when the men find the arrive home on a Friday night,

565
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Tata and Fiscal look exhausted as they descend from the truck.

566
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Tata's face has deep grooves in it that are dark brown with dirt.

567
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Fiscal's clothes which used to be blue and gray are now a muddy brown.

568
00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Flakes of cake, cake on mud, shed off its clothes as he makes his way over to us.

569
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
When they approach, they say nothing, only not in us, tiredly.

570
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Tata smiles at me when I wave and takes my hand in his as we walk toward the house.

571
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Later that night after Tata and Fiscal watch up,

572
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Wash up, we are all sitting around the Shabbat dinner table.

573
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Tata tells Mama that they are being forced to work for the Germans.

574
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000
It is hard label, labor, and the men feel like slaves as they are never paid for their work.

575
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
They are given very little food and very little water.

576
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
When Mama asks what they are doing for the Germans, Tata says they pay roads,

577
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
cut wood for bridges, lay foundations, dig ditches, and sometimes they work in factories.

578
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
No matter what they are doing, they work hard long hours.

579
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
The guards watch them closely throughout the day and threaten anyone who hasn't working hard enough.

580
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Tata says he and Fiscal keep their heads down and works steadily so they can come home to us on Friday nights.

581
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Yep.

582
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
You can't even explain how horrible this was.

583
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Unbelievable.

584
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
One night when Tata and Fiscal are sitting quietly by the stove,

585
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
I asked Tata why no one does anything about this situation.

586
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Tata says Rosie, we have to be patient for the rules since we are not in charge.

587
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Of course we would like to be paid, but we can't force them to pay us.

588
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:24.000
God will reward us for being kind to the Hungarians.

589
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
People whisper all around me that Jews are to turn in their radios.

590
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
We are no longer allowed access to public information or news program.

591
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I hear whispers among the adults about what could be happening in other places.

592
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Many people look grim and shake their heads as they head home to inform their families.

593
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I run nearly all the way home to tell Mama.

594
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
I learn later that only one Jewish family keeps a radio in the cellar of their home

595
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
to find their rule.

596
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
This is a huge risk because if the Hungarians find out, they will kill all the people in that house.

597
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
You're right. Absolutely.

598
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Now I'm going to fast forward. You guys live under these conditions.

599
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I mean, just brutal conditions.

600
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.000
And then we get in the spring of 1944, I'm nearly 14 years old and living under the fastest rule of the Hungarians.

601
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
My village is different, locked down and under their rule.

602
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Jews are prisoners in our village forced to stay put and avoid being seen or noticed.

603
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Non-Jews run the town, having taken over all the shops.

604
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Mama looks tired and Tata's gone most of the time.

605
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
I miss him so much, especially because he always helped me understand the world.

606
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Right now the world doesn't make any sense to me.

607
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
I miss my old life even school.

608
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
One morning, a month before Passover as I am playing with my sisters in the lane,

609
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
I hear loud noises coming from down the road.

610
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
As we watch soldiers in dark green uniforms and black helmets march into town,

611
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
they wear tall black boots, thick leather belt to a shiny buckles,

612
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
and a large red arm band with a spider on it.

613
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
I'm unsure who these soldiers are.

614
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I've never seen uniforms like these before.

615
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
I'm worried, this time I do not wave to the soldiers.

616
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
They make me feel worried.

617
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Germans, I hear several women whisper.

618
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
I studied the outfits of the Germans soldiers and wonder how these women know them to be German.

619
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
How have they come to take over our country?

620
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Those are SS, one announces.

621
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
What's the SS another asks?

622
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
The Secret Service.

623
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
I heard they are the most brutal of the German Nazi forces.

624
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:50.000
It's interesting that even you as a young girl when you saw the Hungarian soldiers,

625
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
you know, you were a little concerned.

626
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
But when you see the Nazis, your instinct is, you know, they're completely different.

627
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Absolutely.

628
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Because my mother and father actually were born in Hungary.

629
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
So we didn't think it was so awful because they were born in Hungary,

630
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
and nothing would happen.

631
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
But of course everything did.

632
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
We never expected, never thought anything so horrible was ahead of us.

633
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
What happened to us?

634
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
You go on here.

635
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.000
One day as we are all chopping vegetables in the chicken, in the kitchen,

636
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
mama interrupts the conversation with a very serious look on her face.

637
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Girls, I know that things are confusing.

638
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
You need to continue to act as if nothing is wrong.

639
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Acting strangely can get us into trouble.

640
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
If you mind your own business and act natural, the soldiers will ignore you and leave you alone.

641
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
That's the hope.

642
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yeah.

643
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Absolutely.

644
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Fast forward a little bit here.

645
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
When the seven days of Passover are over, Mama sends me to the bakery to buy bread.

646
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000
During Passover, we eat no bread.

647
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I cannot wait to taste bread again, and I hurry into town to buy it.

648
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
On my way out of the bakery with my fresh loaves,

649
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
tucked under my arm, I hear the town cryer beating his drum.

650
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I join the other people and gather around him to listen to the news.

651
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
He tells everyone that all Jews are being shipped out by train.

652
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000
They need to pack a bag of belongings and go to the school within 48 hours.

653
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
I rush home to tell Mama, but she has already heard the news.

654
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000
I'm relieved, taught to official our home, and not at work camp,

655
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
so we can all be together.

656
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Mama and Tata also know we need to bring valuables to the school for registration and safe keeping.

657
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tata decides not to fall this rule.

658
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.000
And wants to hire a valuable jewelry instead.

659
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
So he actually takes some of the jewelry and hides it.

660
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
It's a denial shoe polish box.

661
00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
And then puts it up above a beam between the ceiling and the wall and the corner.

662
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.000
And your sisters didn't even want to know where it was going to be.

663
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You're the only one that was brave enough to say, okay dad, tell me.

664
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
My father said come with me, I want to show it to you.

665
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
So when you come back after the war, you know where it is.

666
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So my two sisters, my Helen and Julie, they don't want any part of it.

667
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
So I told my father, I'll go with you.

668
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000
So we went to the court, one of the rooms in the house, took a ladder,

669
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000
and my father opened a little area between the ceiling and the wall and the corner.

670
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
And we put the, wasn't much jewelry, because we didn't.

671
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
I have my jewelry in those days.

672
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
My father had the wedding band and his pocket watch.

673
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
By the way, this is a chain from my father's pocket watch.

674
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
I wear that every day.

675
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And I go to the chain.

676
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
He put into that box.

677
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
This is one of the chains.

678
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
And my mother, all she had was a pair of earrings and necklace and a wedding band.

679
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
There may be a little something else.

680
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
So a little shoe polish box was plenty big for that.

681
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
So we hit it and we hit it and we covered it with dirt.

682
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
So nobody should notice it.

683
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
So I'm after we came back after the war.

684
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I knew exactly what it was and so we divided the jewelry between the three of us.

685
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
So now the day comes.

686
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
When the day, when the next day arrives,

687
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Mom and Strux us to wear three layers of our best clothes,

688
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
because we don't know where we are going or how long we will be gone.

689
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
No one knows where we will be able to do laundry.

690
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
I choose my warmest clothes and mama packs are down quilts in case it gets cold.

691
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
We each pack a burlap bag with our belongings.

692
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I'm excited to travel on the train for the first time.

693
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
As I have never gone beyond the neighboring towns on either side of my village.

694
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
When the time comes to leave, we are all packed and ready.

695
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
It's April 1944.

696
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
And how you saw her?

697
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Who is now 21 and you key who is 19 help mom and aunt Lee with the younger kids.

698
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Fishla 16 and I am 14 years old. Patio's 13, blimptuous 10, Faye's 8.

699
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Maybere, myrbear is 6 years old.

700
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Tottene mama lead her whole family toward the school with each of the older kids carrying a burlap bag of belongings.

701
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:32.000
There are a lot of people at the school when we arrive and all of them are Jewish.

702
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
This train station is the biggest building I've ever been in.

703
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:44.000
I hear some of the adults talking about how the station transport shipments of bricks all over Europe from the brick factory here.

704
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Mama points out that Jews from all the neighboring villages are here in Uvar with us.

705
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:57.000
We remain in the train station for three or four weeks under the watchful eyes of Hungarian soldiers with guard dogs.

706
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:05.000
We sleep in tents at night. The soldiers remind us regularly that Jews are not to try and run away or they will be shot.

707
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Our parents continue to reassure us that we should not worry as God will protect us.

708
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.000
And then the story here is the story that I read in the opening of you actually getting on the train.

709
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:37.000
You're packed in there, you're traveling for days and finally when you arrive, the doors unlocked and a man in a blue and white uniform climbs into our cattle car and tells us we're in the ashwoods Poland.

710
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
He begins telling people what to do next and helping them move their belongings. He asked me how old I am.

711
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
And I tell him I'm 14 years old. He murmurs tell them you're 18.

712
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
You'd key is telling is holding my little brother, Myrbear.

713
00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:01.000
The man asks her if this is her child, no he is my brother she replies. He tells her that young children must stay with their mothers.

714
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:09.000
He gives information to many people as we climb down off the cattle car. Once we once on the ground all luggage and possessions are tossed into a big pile.

715
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
We are putting the rows of five people and directed to walk on for about five minutes.

716
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:23.000
There's no talking allowed and everyone is confused because we don't know what's coming next. When we arrive in front of three German SS officers and uniform, they begin to separate us into groups.

717
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:30.000
One of them asked me how old I am. And I follow the advice of the man on the train. I tell the soldier that I'm 18 years old.

718
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Hi, a story response. No, she isn't. She's 14. No, I'm 18. I insist. The officers wave my sisters and meet to the left. Tottene, fish alert directed to the line and the right.

719
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:50.000
While Mama, Aunt Lee and my three little sisters and baby brother go forward, joining another line of people.

720
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I don't know why they are separating us but you keep telling me to be quiet and not ask questions. Just do what they say she insists.

721
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.000
The guards quickly move everyone along. So there is no time to talk to Mama or Totta.

722
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.000
I try to keep my eyes on them as their lines move in often different directions but I quickly lose sight of them.

723
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:15.000
I wonder how long it will be until I see them again.

724
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Maybe they separate men from women here but that doesn't explain why Mama and Lee and the little kids went in another line.

725
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
So many things are happening that don't make sense to me. My thoughts get interrupted when the soldiers yell at us to keep moving.

726
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:34.000
You'd keep high to sorrow and I follow our line into a big bathroom marked logger camp C.

727
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Maybe here we will wash up after being stuck in the cattle car for days.

728
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Instead we are ordered to take off all our clothes and toss them in a pile.

729
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
I slowly remove the three dresses that Mama had me wear.

730
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000
I pause when I have stripped down to my underwear and look at the many women around me. Everyone is undressing.

731
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
I have never been naked in front of strangers before and I am feeling confused and humiliated.

732
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000
This is so wrong but no one is saying anything.

733
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
When high you sura and you'd keep start removing their undergarments like the other women, I slowly do too.

734
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:14.000
I am shivering and feel scared. The soldiers take photographs of us, of us humiliating us further.

735
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
I think this must be hell because I have never experienced anything worse.

736
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
I am appalled to realize that the next step is to have every hair shaved off our bodies.

737
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:31.000
I cannot understand why they need to take hair off my head, arms, legs and even my most private places.

738
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
I can see other Jewish women don't understand what is going on either and look ashamed.

739
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
The faces of all the women shaving us are like stone, showing no emotion at all.

740
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
I feel so exposed with no clothes and now no hair to cover me.

741
00:59:45.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I reach up to touch my hairless head and am shocked to feel my nubby and bruised scalp from the rough handling of the emotionless women with the razor.

742
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.000
After we are shaved we are ordered to grab a dress from a pile on the cement floor and give in wooden clogs.

743
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
The clog seemed to be all the same size but don't really fit anymore.

744
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
They are hard and difficult to walk in. I have to shuffle the githney where my hair straight.

745
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
My dress hangs down to the ground like a sack since my head is freezing.

746
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I tear off a piece of fabric from the bottom of my dress to wrap around my head.

747
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
At least my head is covered but I am still very cold.

748
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I don't understand why I can't retrieve my old socks and undergarments that are in a heap on the floor close by.

749
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
As soon as we are dressed we are forced to go outside and line up for Zella-Pell.

750
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Zella-Pell which is a roll call.

751
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Right.

752
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
It is now late in the evening and there are so many people moving about that I get separated from my sisters.

753
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I am frightened and frantically call out their names.

754
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Two bald women and dingy dresses approached me.

755
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
They reach for me and reassure me. Rozy, it's us.

756
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I hugged them both fiercely and stammer. I did not recognize you.

757
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:11.000
I am so relieved to be with them that I can't stop shaking.

758
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I mean any illusion that things were going to work out in any way that could be remotely considered.

759
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Humane must are completely shattered at this point.

760
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Completely shattered.

761
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:32.000
You know when you are being told hey pack a bag, hey get on the train, like those things don't sound good but they at least sound.

762
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
They at least sound somewhat reasonable.

763
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
They sound like a reasonable okay.

764
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We got our bag. We are going to be taking somewhere.

765
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
All that is completely gone now.

766
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Absolutely. Absolutely.

767
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
And you are 14 years old.

768
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Right.

769
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
How tall are you?

770
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Five, one.

771
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So you are this little girl.

772
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Just followed rules.

773
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Whatever they were saying, we had to just follow.

774
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Things happened so fast. You cannot imagine.

775
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
We didn't even have time to think about anything.

776
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Go here, go there, do this, do that and that's it.

777
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
You know, it's it's one of the things that they do in the military, right?

778
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
As they take you, they take everything that you have.

779
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
They shave your head and they're trying to get rid of your individuality, right?

780
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
They want to they want to remove some of that.

781
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And this is just the exact, you know, what they're doing it to an absolute extreme, you know,

782
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000
stripping you naked and shaving your entire body and just removing anything that you had from the past.

783
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Well, I don't think you can compare that to the military.

784
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
No, I'm not trying to compare it to the military.

785
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I guess I'm just trying to say that the idea of the rules, I guess.

786
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Well, the idea of when they shave your head in the military, part of what they're doing is trying to take away some of your individuality, right?

787
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
So that you can become part of the group.

788
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Here they're trying to take away your humanity.

789
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
That's it.

790
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
That's what they did.

791
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Going on here, it says all of us notice a huge fire spewing heavy smoke that looks like a burning mountain across the open area from us.

792
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I can see shadows of people moving through the smoke and can hear the cries of children.

793
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
There's an overpowering foul smell coming from the fire.

794
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Somehow I taste the fire in my mouth.

795
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You'd get asked the guard as she gestures toward the fire.

796
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
What is all that noise about?

797
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
The guard responds there burning hair.

798
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
You can reply as burning hair would not make such a noise to which he snaps.

799
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
They are burning cripples.

800
01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:02.000
A sick feeling comes over me as I realize the guards and soldiers are barbaric, cold-blooded animals.

801
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So that's your first recognition that we are going to receive zero.

802
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Right.

803
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Humanity from these guards.

804
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Absolutely.

805
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
You can't even explain how things were.

806
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
They were so horrible, so unbelievable.

807
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And this all went on for so long and nobody tried to help us.

808
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Because this is 1944.

809
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Right.

810
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So this had been going on.

811
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
This was five months before our part of the world was liberated.

812
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
You know that?

813
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:45.000
By September 1944, our part was liberated by the Russians.

814
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Going back to the book, Barricut 26 is our sleeping quarters.

815
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I've never seen anything like it before.

816
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Dirt floors and rows of wooden, three-tiered bunks.

817
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
No straw-filled mattresses.

818
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
No blankets or pillows.

819
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
No heat.

820
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
A fireplace that doesn't work.

821
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
How you sit, you'd key, and I are assigned to the top bunk with five other women.

822
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We climb up and huddle body to stay warm during the freezing cold night.

823
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I'm so thankful that my sisters are with me because everything is foreign, harsh, unexplained,

824
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
and unbearably cold.

825
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
The next morning I decided to look around the camp to figure out where we are.

826
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I assure my sisters, there are a lot of people milling around and I can blend in or hide.

827
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000
I will be careful.

828
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I walk outside and I'm shocked to see many barracks just like the one we slept in.

829
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Arranged and rose the buildings.

830
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
There are dozens of people walking around outdoors, all shaved, all shivering.

831
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Some are wandering around like zombies.

832
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
When I try to talk to one of these zombie-like women, she just stares through me, doesn't answer,

833
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and keeps walking.

834
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
She's truly frightening to me.

835
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
It is as though she is here, but not really here at all.

836
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
There is a 12 foot electric fence encircling the camp.

837
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Dead people hang from the fence.

838
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Their bodies contorted.

839
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I wonder why so many would grab onto the electric fence to end their life.

840
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
What kind of hell are we in?

841
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Why are we prisoners?

842
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Feeling like a second-class citizen at home was nothing compared to this.

843
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I'm on a mission to learn all I can, so I ask those who have been here longer to help me understand.

844
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Most of the women are very patient with me asking questions because they remember how frightening and foreign everything was for them.

845
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:45.000
When they arrived, they explained that some people cannot endure the severity of the camp and know that if they hold onto the electrified fence, their life ends in 20 seconds.

846
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
One thing I learned for certain is no one can escape.

847
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:59.000
There are guards with guns, the deadly electric fence, and people watching your every move, this must be hell.

848
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Unbelievable.

849
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Unexplained.

850
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000
The half-dead zombie-like people in the bodies clinging to the electric fence are overpowering.

851
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I am in a day seeing the true horrors of war here.

852
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
As I walk around, I think I hear my Yiddish name called out softly.

853
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
How could anyone in this god forsake in place know my Yiddish name, but then I hear it again.

854
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Rosie.

855
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I turned to see a man in a striped uniform who I did not recognize, but who is beckoning to me.

856
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
He approaches me and says, don't you know who I am? I'm your tata.

857
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
With a wave of pure shock, I realize it is tata. I'm tremendously relieved that home tata always wore a suit and hat and glasses and had a beard.

858
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I look again at this man with no hair and I know it's him.

859
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I hug him as tight as I can, crying, kiss him and kiss him some more.

860
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
His arms around me are the first sense of warmth I've felt since arriving.

861
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
The tata explains that he and official were selected to go work in a factory.

862
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
They will leave soon, but in the meantime he has been looking everywhere for his family.

863
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He decided we must be in this all women's camp where the Hungarian people are sent.

864
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Where is your mother he asks?

865
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I don't know, but I have you can hear you saw her with me.

866
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Whatever you do, stay together because you will have a much better chance of survival.

867
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Tata replies.

868
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I think what chance is a 14 year old have surviving in the place like this, but I don't say anything.

869
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Tata holds both of my arms at my side.

870
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It looks me in the eyes and certainly says, make sure you stay alive so you can tell the world what they are doing to us.

871
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I sure am I will do my best.

872
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Then he and I make plans for us to meet again tomorrow at this spot.

873
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
That's a heavy charge for my dad.

874
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Oh my god.

875
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yeah.

876
01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Unbelievable.

877
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000
You know, every time I open the book and I go through it a little bit, I just can't believe that

878
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
this happened to us.

879
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
That the world allowed this.

880
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And the world knew what was going on.

881
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
But nobody tried to help us.

882
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Just because you were Jewish.

883
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm going to continue on the next day.

884
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:52.000
You'd get higher solder and I wait at the designated spot to meet up with Tata.

885
01:09:52.000 --> 01:10:02.000
When we see them, I cry and relief. We all hug and kiss each other and we are so happy to have time together.

886
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Tata repeats his soul and advice to each of us.

887
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Do your best to stay together.

888
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Stay alive so you can tell the world what they are doing to us.

889
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
The next day we go to our spot to meet Tata on official.

890
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
As planned, we wait and wait and wait for what seems to like an eternity.

891
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But they do not come.

892
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Fast forward a little bit.

893
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
How you saw her? You'd get and I have no choice but to stay together in this evil place.

894
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000
We share a bunk bed, meals and one bathroom with a thousand women.

895
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
No one is allowed to use the bathroom at night.

896
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
It has sinks with cold running water but no soap for us to wash up.

897
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
There's no toilet just to hold him around.

898
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
There's nowhere to shower or take baths.

899
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
We only have one plain dress.

900
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
We are wearing a no way to clean it except with the cold water.

901
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Without a shower or soap we are constantly filthy.

902
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
We are always itchy with the bites of lights and bed bugs.

903
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
We can rinse out our dress and walk around naked while it dries.

904
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
It doesn't really matter because we are surrounded by 28,000 women in the same predicament.

905
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
We have no way really to clean our dress or our clogs.

906
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
We are left to rot for months in the same horrible dress.

907
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I realize quickly this concentration of water is not a good thing.

908
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
We have no way to clean our dress or our clogs.

909
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We are left to rot for months in the same horrible dress.

910
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
I realize quickly this concentration camp has some predictable events.

911
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Every day as they count us, every day they count us as we stand in rows of 5 people.

912
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
At 5am the guard shall get up, get up, shnel, shnel, quick, quick.

913
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
We all rise and run outdoors to be counted whether it is freezing, rainy or sunny.

914
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
We stand in lines for hours, three times a day until the guards have a tally.

915
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Then we are released back to our barracks.

916
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.000
I am told this is how they know how much space is available for the new people they bring in by train every day.

917
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000
People leave to go to work in factories, get killed or are gassed so the counting is necessary.

918
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Sometimes we are forced to kneel and hold up rocks until our arms feel like they will break in the rocks fall.

919
01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Other times they make us move rocks from one spot to another, then back to the original location.

920
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
It doesn't make any sense but we don't ask questions.

921
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:11.000
We keep our heads down and do what we are told because any resistance may mean we will be shot.

922
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I have seen it happen.

923
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I cannot escape the horrible smell of the cremaatorium's chimney of the burning bodies 24 hours a day.

924
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:45.000
The second extension burning flesh makes me want to vomit and never becomes less upsetting emotionally.

925
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
The smoke and smell burn a black hole in my heart.

926
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:59.000
We have to find a way out of this place and that will require me knowing as much as possible about how it is run.

927
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Women explain that prisoners are chosen for jobs and they must comply.

928
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Any Jewish worker who resist is shot dead on the spot.

929
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Strong Jewish women called capos are put in charge of running each barric.

930
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
The capos live amongst us in the barric and watch everything.

931
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
They are not paid but they have certain rights that others lack.

932
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
They may get more food but they are doing the dirty work for the Germans.

933
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
The cooks preparing the meals are Jewish as well.

934
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Jews clean out the bathroom in the barric city that is used by 28,000 women.

935
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Jews even work the gas chamber.

936
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Everything was done by the Jews.

937
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
If you didn't do it they would shoot you on the spot.

938
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You had no choice.

939
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
They would see their own families going to the gas chamber and there wasn't nothing.

940
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Anything they could do or say.

941
01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:06.000
You say here this is too much for me to process and I begin to see why some people touch the electric fence to end their misery.

942
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I ask repeatedly why we can hear people crying out near the crematorium.

943
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
I learn that when a group is gased in the showers.

944
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Not all the people are dead when they burn the bodies.

945
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Maybe they don't give them enough gas because we can hear the screaming coming from the crematorium.

946
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:37.000
The men running the incinerators called Sonder Commandos will be sent into them soon so they cannot tell the world what is happening.

947
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So you even have the Jews are running the factories.

948
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
They are running the gas chambers.

949
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They are running everything.

950
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And eventually they are going into them too.

951
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Absolutely.

952
01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yes.

953
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Usually the gas chambers I heard from many people say that after three months they would change the guards at the gas chambers.

954
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I've read three months they would change them.

955
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
The months of their three months they put them in the gas chamber and they get new ones in.

956
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
So at the end of three months you go into the gas chamber.

957
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:19.000
The people working there yes at the gas chambers.

958
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Would you talk to other people?

959
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Would you talk to other people besides your sisters?

960
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Was there any sense of community?

961
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.000
No.

962
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Was it just broken spirit?

963
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Broken spirit and the thing is we came to Auschwitz and they were always people.

964
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We couldn't make you couldn't become friends with the people there because we were all there.

965
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
We were in camp sea.

966
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And Auschwitz were coming out.

967
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And this was a transitional camp.

968
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You come.

969
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
You get selected and you leave.

970
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000
The only people that stayed behind us was like me because I was skin on board and it wouldn't select me to go to work.

971
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I would run out of the gas chamber line.

972
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And nobody sees me.

973
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
They would see me.

974
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
They would shoot me on the spot.

975
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
They did not want to take people to factories to work that were skin and bone.

976
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:16.000
So it's just you and your sisters.

977
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Everyone else is kind of transient.

978
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Yes.

979
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And there's no feeling of community.

980
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
No, none whatsoever.

981
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
It's just broken spirits.

982
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Absolutely.

983
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
We never know who's going to be there tomorrow.

984
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
We had twenty eight.

985
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
We had thirty barracks in this place.

986
01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
One barrack was a kitchen.

987
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
One barrack was a bathroom.

988
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And people were coming in all the time.

989
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Coming and going.

990
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Coming and going.

991
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
And of course there were so many dead bodies always in our camp.

992
01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
They would come.

993
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000
They would commit suicide by touching the electric fences.

994
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
And just could not couldn't take it anymore.

995
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
You touch the fence.

996
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Twenty seconds later, you see blood coming out of the nose and your dead.

997
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And they would pick up.

998
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
They would come with those big real burrows every day to collect the dead bodies.

999
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You say here, one day I ask a woman, why haven't seen my mother on.

1000
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
My little sister's in brother.

1001
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:41.000
The lady is careful to gently tell me what I think I already know.

1002
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
She sadly affirms that my worst fears are correct.

1003
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
When they got off the train, they were put in a line that led directly to the gas chamber.

1004
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I would say 80% of the people that came in on the train,

1005
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:05.000
so I went into the gas chamber. All the mothers children, the sick, the crippled,

1006
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
the old age.

1007
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
The only people they tried to say were the ones that could go for slave labor.

1008
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
To go to factors to work.

1009
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
You continue on here.

1010
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I remind me of how lucky I was to be accepted as being 18 and eligible for the adult factory workline.

1011
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
If the sorters had known I was 14, I would have gone with my mother and on and younger siblings.

1012
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Straight to the gas chamber.

1013
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I do not feel lucky in any way right now.

1014
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I just can't get used to the idea that my mother, three sisters and little brother are gone and it's beyond comprehension.

1015
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:51.000
When you keep high asada and I try to talk about it, we cannot speak, we just cry.

1016
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
We have to keep going like to talk to all of us.

1017
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.000
It will eventually get better. We believe we need to have hope.

1018
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I have difficulty processing all of this and have to keep asking myself why, why, why.

1019
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I think this section right here is one of the most powerful pieces.

1020
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:24.000
You say this, one of the ladies hugs me close and says, you will never understand what these Germans are doing because it is beyond comprehension.

1021
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:31.000
It does not make sense and it never will. They are crazy out of their minds. You are not.

1022
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Remember, you are the same one here.

1023
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Go where you need to go inside of yourself and remember who you are.

1024
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
They cannot steal your soul unless you give it to them. Never give them your soul.

1025
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Follow the rules and survive so that the real you can blossom again when you are free.

1026
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
War is a horrible thing but it will end.

1027
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:06.000
When it does, there is another life for you outside of Auschwitz and you need to live for that.

1028
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000
That's how it be survived really.

1029
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.000
By hoping and things, no, that things will be better someday.

1030
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:28.000
And I guess I mean the difference between having that attitude of things will get better someday and thinking that they won't.

1031
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Those are the people that are going to go and grab the electric fence.

1032
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
That's it. They just gave up. They couldn't handle it anymore.

1033
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Who is this woman? Do you remember who this woman was that told you this?

1034
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I have no idea. Probably somebody much older than me.

1035
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Remember I was a 14 year old. I was a young kid.

1036
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Did you, did you believe?

1037
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I mean it had to be hard looking at these surroundings to believe that this could be that they really could be.

1038
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Hope beyond this.

1039
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Well, if I did not have hope, I listened to my father. He said, whatever you do, stay alive so you can tell the world what they're doing to us.

1040
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Okay.

1041
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
That was your mission.

1042
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
That was my mission.

1043
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Actually, it was more my mission than my two sisters.

1044
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:29.000
They would get very angry with me sometime because I would do things that was not the right thing to do in a place like this.

1045
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Okay.

1046
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Well, you would take risks.

1047
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Right. Absolutely.

1048
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
You're a little bit of a hard person to subdue.

1049
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Actually, even as a child, many times the mother said, you're acting like a boy.

1050
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
You're not acting like a young lady.

1051
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Here's another little part about what you guys are eating.

1052
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
The only thing we got for breakfast is black coffee. You didn't describe what the black coffee is not coffee at all.

1053
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.000
It's horrible. It was horrible. I took one sip and that's the only time I ever tried it.

1054
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I thought I was going to throw up. It was so horrible.

1055
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You say we are literally starving.

1056
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
We are absolutely.

1057
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Lunch is nothing but a piece of bread.

1058
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Slice of bread was a piece of margarine.

1059
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Yes.

1060
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Occasionally, we'll give us butter to put on it. The bread is dry and hard and we are told they put saw dust in it.

1061
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
We line up outdoors to get a bread to get our bread at a table staffed by the kitchen women.

1062
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
We do not share our bread.

1063
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
It is coveted and sometimes hidden away for later.

1064
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
The food tastes horrible and is not enough to live on.

1065
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:48.000
It is not surprising that some prisoners here have a German nickname, Musselman.

1066
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Is that right?

1067
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Yes.

1068
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Which means skeletal or skin and bones.

1069
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
At dinner time, we get a pot of soup to share among a dozen women.

1070
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
We are hungry every day. There is never enough to eat.

1071
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
An officer comes in the barracks and shouts.

1072
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I need 300 women for selection for factory work.

1073
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Many women hurry outside to be selected.

1074
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Anything must be better than this place.

1075
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Once they line up, everyone removes their clothes.

1076
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Their officers can examine their physique to decide if they are healthy and strong enough to do factory work.

1077
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000
If a woman is too weak or thin, they label her as a musselman and send her to the gas chamber.

1078
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I don't know if it is because of food or illness, but I have a bad doubt of diarrhea and I am very weak.

1079
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
I can't stand and walk for the first few weeks of my illness.

1080
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000
You to gain higher sought-a will not go outside to be selected without me.

1081
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
So we hide when the officers call for volunteers.

1082
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
It is not hard to hide with the thousand people in the barracks and they only need 200 or 300 women.

1083
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
The officers do not notice me. This works for the first three or four weeks, but I am just skin and bones now.

1084
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I know I need to be selected for a factory to get out of here.

1085
01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You can hire Sara, help me stand up and pinch my cheeks, so I look like I have some color.

1086
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
The problem comes when I undress.

1087
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I am so frightened because I know I am too thin and weak to be chosen.

1088
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:14.000
My worst fears come true when the officers call me musselman and send me to the gas chamber line.

1089
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It is a torturous few minutes walking to that line.

1090
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
My sisters help me get there holding me under my arms as we cry and panic.

1091
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000
There is so much going on around us that I begin to wonder if we can somehow sneak away.

1092
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I tell you, King Hayesara, what I am thinking and we agree to try it.

1093
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
We have no other choice.

1094
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.000
At the agreed upon moment, we calmly step out of the line and head straight back to our barrack.

1095
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
All of our hearts are pumping wildly.

1096
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
If an SS officer notices we will be shot on the spot.

1097
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Luckily there are a lot of women moving about the camp and no one notices.

1098
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
You have any idea what you waited at this point?

1099
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I have no idea.

1100
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
But you are just skin and bone.

1101
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I was even at home.

1102
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I was very thin.

1103
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I was not a big eater.

1104
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
This wasn't good.

1105
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
That wasn't good.

1106
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
You are a child.

1107
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:24.000
And the gas chamber line, that is exactly what that is.

1108
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Absolutely.

1109
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You know, when I get in this line, I am going to be dead in three minutes or whatever the minute is.

1110
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
They are just walking out of the line.

1111
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
They look at you, two skinny, muscle men go over there.

1112
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
One over here, one over there.

1113
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
They always put me in the gas chamber line.

1114
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I would make sure nobody sees me.

1115
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I would get out of the gas chamber line.

1116
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
They would catch me.

1117
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
They would probably shoot me on the spot.

1118
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Remember, we had close to over 28,000 women in that camp.

1119
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And they brought in over 500,000 Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz,

1120
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
April and May of 1944.

1121
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Everybody that came into Auschwitz, we went into Camp C or the gas chambers.

1122
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:32.000
You had to have a lot of guts to survive and also hope for a better day.

1123
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And you are a risk taker.

1124
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yes.

1125
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Clearly, you are taken a risk by going out there and taking a risk by getting out of line.

1126
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.000
You got a lot of bravery in these situations.

1127
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You had to.

1128
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
If you didn't do it, you are gone.

1129
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
The only people that survived are the ones that had bravery really.

1130
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
You say food is such a problem for all of us, but particularly for me since I am too thin.

1131
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
At lunch one day we stand in line outside to get our bread as usual.

1132
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
The capo gives me a slice of bread, which I notice is half its usual slice.

1133
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I am hungry, so I speak without thinking.

1134
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
My bread is cut in half, I accrues a cusher.

1135
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The capo is furious with me because my accusation can get her in a lot of trouble with the Germans.

1136
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.000
She pulls me out of line and takes me to where the German SS officers will be sure to see her actions.

1137
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
She beats me so brutally that I cannot stand for three days afterwards.

1138
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
My sisters are both concerned and frustrated with me for getting into trouble.

1139
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You'd key tells me, next time just shut up, don't ever complain about anything again.

1140
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
You will only get you in trouble.

1141
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Do you want to get shot?

1142
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
I know she's right, but I struggle at the injustice.

1143
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
We are already starving.

1144
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
How can they steal half my meager food?

1145
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Still, I need to learn to keep my mouth shut.

1146
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Right.

1147
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
What did you guys look at the capos?

1148
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
I don't know if we looked at them.

1149
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000
All we knew is over there.

1150
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
We didn't see them too often.

1151
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
The only time we saw them is when they came to select people to go to factories to work.

1152
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Did you look at them as fellow Jews?

1153
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
They were...

1154
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
You mean the capos?

1155
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:11.000
The capos?

1156
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Oh, excuse me.

1157
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I think you're talking about the SS.

1158
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Well, they had to do the work.

1159
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Otherwise, they would get shot.

1160
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
If they don't do what they asked to do,

1161
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and they would not do the job.

1162
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But when the capos, when they did get these jobs,

1163
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
they could get extra food.

1164
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
They could get extra, all kinds of things.

1165
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You know what I mean?

1166
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
They were in charge of thousands of them and in every barrel.

1167
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So they had to be very strong and do the right thing.

1168
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Otherwise, they wouldn't do it.

1169
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:48.000
They wouldn't choose them to do it.

1170
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Was the... was your view of the capos?

1171
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Like, hey, they're just doing what they have to do to survive?

1172
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
I don't know if we did when we were there.

1173
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
But now I know that they had to do what they...

1174
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
...shows them to do.

1175
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
They had no choice.

1176
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Okay?

1177
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
But they were our own people.

1178
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000
They did this work.

1179
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
You go in here today.

1180
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Good fortune is upon us.

1181
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
One of the ladies in Barric 26 tells us that we have a cousin's in Barric 3.

1182
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
We are shocked to...

1183
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
...and all three of us begin asking questions in rapid succession.

1184
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000
What are their names?

1185
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
How did you find them?

1186
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Are you sure?

1187
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
How did you figure out where we're related?

1188
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
In Barric 3, my cousins are in charge of the whole Barric including food distribution.

1189
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
They help get me extra food every day and begin to gain weight and think more clearly.

1190
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It literally saves my life to have a little more food.

1191
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000
I'm so thankful to be with them in this horrible place.

1192
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Yeah.

1193
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
So there's another little thing that allows you to survive.

1194
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Right.

1195
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Right.

1196
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
It was amazing that they found out.

1197
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I mean, so many thousands of women over there.

1198
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000
And they were all the way in the beginning of the camp.

1199
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Number two or three, I'm not really sure.

1200
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Okay?

1201
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
And they were in charge of giving out the food.

1202
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
So of course, my big God there.

1203
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We would get extra whatever there was.

1204
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:19.000
As the months go slowly by in September of 1944, we notice that Auschwitz begins to empty out.

1205
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Our cousins are taking a work in a factory and so we are sad to see them go as the barracks residents to window.

1206
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It makes our exit more urgent.

1207
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Now there are less people hiding.

1208
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Nest, less people behind among.

1209
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
We are risk of being noticed.

1210
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
We are getting stronger and less skeletal.

1211
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
So I urge my sisters to try selection with me again.

1212
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
But I am labeled as a musselman and sent to the gas chamber line.

1213
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Mozilla.

1214
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Mozilla.

1215
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Mozilla.

1216
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Mozilla.

1217
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Skin and bone.

1218
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Skin and bones.

1219
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Mozilla.

1220
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
At least I can get out of line now on my own and head back to the barrack.

1221
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I do this repeatedly.

1222
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Enough that we decide I can no longer go through the selection process at all.

1223
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
I will be caught sneaking away from the line and shot.

1224
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
There has to be another way.

1225
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
We have to get out of here and repeat over and over in my mind.

1226
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I know we cannot give up because I have hope.

1227
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I always remember what my father told me.

1228
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Stay together because your chances of survival will be much better.

1229
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It is not easy to keep hope alive when we are in camp.

1230
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Giving up seems easier.

1231
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
And we see many who do give up and end up on the electric fencing.

1232
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.000
There are a few good rumors that help us have hope.

1233
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Women gather in the bathroom to hear the latest rumor that the Americans or Russians may liberate us.

1234
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
The hope that we will reunite with Tata and Fiscal keeps us alive.

1235
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Even with this hope it is hard to continue believing in something.

1236
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
We all question our faith in God.

1237
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
How could God allow this to happen?

1238
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Following the Jewish laws.

1239
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
God us nowhere.

1240
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:59.000
One day in 1944 the SS officers arrived at the barracks and announcing they need 300 women to go to a German factory.

1241
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
In Freudian.

1242
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Freudian.

1243
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Freudian.

1244
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
This is the day that you keep how you saw it and I will be chosen.

1245
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I know it.

1246
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
As we are getting up to the line.

1247
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
As we are preparing to line up I look at my sisters and tell them,

1248
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Go get selected and save me a place in line.

1249
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
I will find a way to sneak into the group.

1250
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
How you saw it and you keep both of them worried but go out in front.

1251
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The front door and get selected.

1252
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I must find a way to get in line without being detected.

1253
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Meanwhile I am working feverishly to come up with a plan to join them.

1254
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Our barracks are always guarded by capo.

1255
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
No matter what.

1256
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
My heart races so loudly that I wonder if others can hear it.

1257
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
As I try to figure out what to do.

1258
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000
I don't have much time.

1259
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000
I must think fast.

1260
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I watch a woman who gives out food from our kitchen as she exits the back of the barrack.

1261
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Suddenly I find myself running as fast as I can down the long hallway of the barrack toward the back door.

1262
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000
The female capo guarding the door raises her hand to stop me.

1263
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:54.000
My heart is beating hard in my chest as she looks at me.

1264
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
You can't go out this door.

1265
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
You have to go out that way to be selected for work.

1266
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
She says pointing in the opposite direction.

1267
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000
I don't want to go to work.

1268
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I say shaking my head.

1269
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
My mother has just gone out that door and I need to go with her.

1270
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
As I point to the door behind her.

1271
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
The second's pass.

1272
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
The second's that pass before she responds.

1273
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Feel like hours.

1274
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
I continue to reach toward the door.

1275
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Employing her to help me.

1276
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Somehow the capo takes pity on me and lets me out the door.

1277
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I scan the area for guards as I sneak around the building to join my sisters in line.

1278
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000
There are enough people moving about that no one sees me enter the group.

1279
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I can see my sisters and they have a spot for me to slide into.

1280
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I feel a sense of freedom for the first time in a long time.

1281
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Suddenly I know I am strong and brave.

1282
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
It is as though an angel is looking after me.

1283
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I think as I look upward, maybe it's my mother who helps me out of this terrible situation.

1284
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Maybe things will get better for us now.

1285
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I make eye contact with how you saw her.

1286
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
She has sheer joy on her face as I approach.

1287
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
She elbows you key to indicate that I am on my way over.

1288
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:58.000
As I end of the line, you key immediately grabs my arm and squeezes it so tight.

1289
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
All of us are frightened and excited at the same time.

1290
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
How you saw her and you key are relieved that I am with them.

1291
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And even have an even a little surprise that I made it.

1292
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I can see the questions on their faces, but silently indicate we can't talk about it now.

1293
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I will explain how I did this later when we are alone.

1294
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
The three of us try to act calm so no one will notice that I am not supposed to be in line.

1295
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I feel their hands as tight as I can, so tight that I can't feel my own fingers.

1296
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000
We have to celebrate internally and happiness springs up inside me.

1297
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Hope and fear are within me.

1298
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Before leaving the camp for the factory, we need to go through a cleaning process.

1299
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
We know we all smell.

1300
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I remember when I first came to camp, I smelled a sour, pungent odor everywhere on everyone.

1301
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000
I guess I have smelled it for so long now that I don't notice it anymore.

1302
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
But you can always see the revulsion on the faces of new prisoners when they arrive.

1303
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
It is the stench of death on living bodies.

1304
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I can see the dirt in the lines on people's faces.

1305
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Our hands don't come clean when we rinse them.

1306
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
The hair that grew back in the last four months is stuck to our heads and has a foul odor.

1307
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It is clear to me that we are not supposed to have been here this long.

1308
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:11.000
But now that time will end if I can make it through the cleaning without being labeled a musliman.

1309
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.000
So once again talking about your courage.

1310
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
To do that.

1311
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
It was unbelievable.

1312
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:24.000
How this all came to me, how I did it, I don't remember.

1313
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
But I did it.

1314
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
The main thing was to get out of there.

1315
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And sometimes you have to do all kinds of things.

1316
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Okay.

1317
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
To get what you want to go.

1318
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.000
And also you should never give up hope.

1319
01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But I hope you lost.

1320
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So whenever you are in anybody's entrapal, they have to remember that things will get better.

1321
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
And that's how we survived the three of us.

1322
01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000
You guys get cleaned up.

1323
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
They shave you again.

1324
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
They de-laus you.

1325
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Well, we were full of lies. We didn't have cleaning in four months.

1326
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Can you imagine?

1327
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
No.

1328
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Not having cleaning in four months.

1329
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Actually, I took my dress up a couple of times in the summer.

1330
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Because we were also lucky that we were there in the summer, not in the winter.

1331
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
If we were to be there in the winter, we would have frozen to that.

1332
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
So we were there in the summer.

1333
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
So I would take my dress up and wash it.

1334
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
There was no soap.

1335
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.000
No nothing.

1336
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And let it dry and then put it back on.

1337
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:47.000
You say, hey, after you get de-laused and cleaned, you say this.

1338
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Finally, we are given decent street clothes to wear.

1339
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
It's the first time in four months. I've changed my clothes.

1340
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000
One of the women pins a piece of paper with a number on it to my dress.

1341
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000
She tells me that this will be my number that identifies me from now on.

1342
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
They've taken away my name.

1343
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:06.000
I am no longer rosy or even a shorts.

1344
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Now, I am just a number.

1345
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
A25893.

1346
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Yep.

1347
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
See it?

1348
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000
You know, a lot of the survivors after the war, they had to take it off.

1349
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
But in the 50s, a surgery wasn't like today.

1350
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
They would always have a mark on their arms.

1351
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
They would never even occur to me to do that.

1352
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And my kids were little. They would ask me what it is.

1353
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
I would tell them it's my telephone number.

1354
01:37:52.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Okay.

1355
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:11.000
They process you now and get you loaded onto a truck that drives you out of the camp.

1356
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:15.000
As we pass through the gates, I feel an incredible weight lifted off my shoulders.

1357
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
This is truly a moment to remember.

1358
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
I know that my life may not be easier at the work factory, but at least we are alive.

1359
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
We are scared in week, but we have left the hell of Auschwitz behind us.

1360
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Right.

1361
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
At the factory, they provide us with more decent street clothes, similar to what I previously owned.

1362
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000
The building is so cold, so we go to bed fully dressed, even our blankets are not enough to keep us warm,

1363
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
but at least we have blankets.

1364
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
The building has a musty odor, but I have my own bed with a mattress sheets, blanket, and pillow.

1365
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
We are allowed to access bathrooms at night.

1366
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000
We can even get a shower with soap, and we are even given clean clothes once a week.

1367
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
The showers and bathroom are just down the hall, compared to the hell of Auschwitz.

1368
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
This feels like heaven.

1369
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
So this is your new location.

1370
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Right.

1371
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And it really is what you have been striving for.

1372
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
To get into one of these work, hence.

1373
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yes.

1374
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Did you know that the work camp was better living or are you just knowing that anything is better than Auschwitz?

1375
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
We didn't know, but everything, anything was better than Auschwitz.

1376
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Okay. I don't think there could be any reverse emulsion with it.

1377
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:30.000
On our first day of work, the numbers that were pinned to our clothes are tattooed onto our left forums.

1378
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:35.000
I know that I should feel pain, but I don't, as I watch them scratch the needle across my skin.

1379
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:43.000
In my mind, I am thinking about the law that Jews may not take, make any cuttings or print any marks on their bodies.

1380
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000
How will God take this new development?

1381
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
I'm not in any position to resist the permanent tattoo that reminds me every single day that I am not free.

1382
01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:01.000
A25893 is in blazing for the world to see every time I reach my hand out to touch my sister or grab a piece of machinery.

1383
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Each day as we leave the factory, we show our tattoo which confirms that we are Jews who belong in the camp and not one of the free citizens that goes home at night.

1384
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.000
When you are working this camp, there is actually regular civilians that are working there.

1385
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Right.

1386
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Germans are the Germans?

1387
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Germans, absolutely.

1388
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
And mostly women because all the men were in the military.

1389
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yes.

1390
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000
You say this, sometimes the German lady who works next to me brings me an apple.

1391
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yes.

1392
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:41.000
The biggest for her to offer me any special treatment because she could be labeled as a Jewish sympathizer and be taken to jail or shot.

1393
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It is also a risk for me because I can be labeled thief.

1394
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
There are no apples given a Jews here, so how would I get one?

1395
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000
It would be up to a guard to decide my fate if I were caught with an apple.

1396
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
We are very careful that no one of the 40 is around when she hands me the apple.

1397
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I think she realizes how hard our lives aren't feels a bit sorry for me.

1398
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:04.000
It is so good to see the humanity and some people because we have lived for months and some of us.

1399
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:11.000
For years surrounded by inhuman and savage guards every day, we have been treated as though we are not human.

1400
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
So this is like the first sympathetic person.

1401
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Right.

1402
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
She was very nice.

1403
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Did you have conversations with her?

1404
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000
You talked to her?

1405
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
We would not have conversations not too much, no.

1406
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Because we were both working at different things.

1407
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.000
But she would bring an extra piece of something sometime.

1408
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
An apple or fruit.

1409
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Even though compared to our shows, this was like heaven.

1410
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Okay.

1411
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
You, you, he was in an area working on ammunition.

1412
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
It is a Yutka.

1413
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Yutka?

1414
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Yutka?

1415
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I am so sorry.

1416
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Yutka?

1417
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Yutka?

1418
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
How about how am I doing with how you saw her?

1419
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Bad? How do you say how you saw her?

1420
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
How you saw her?

1421
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.000
That is a Yutka.

1422
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:02.000
How you saw her?

1423
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.000
That is a Yutka name.

1424
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
How you saw her?

1425
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Helen?

1426
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Helen?

1427
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Her English name was Helen.

1428
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Or in check it was Helen, co.

1429
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Okay.

1430
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I need to stick with one.

1431
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
She is sewing.

1432
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Yutka?

1433
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Yes.

1434
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Is working on ammunition and your work on gas masks.

1435
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Right.

1436
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Inspecting gas masks.

1437
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Which is obviously a hard thing because you are thinking that these gas masks are for German soldiers.

1438
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It is going to save the lines of German soldiers.

1439
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Absolutely.

1440
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Absolutely.

1441
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
We had no choice.

1442
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
I would sit on a high chair and then have to pick up the gas mask.

1443
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.000
We can side it and put it up.

1444
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Up and down.

1445
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
12 hours every day.

1446
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And Judy and Judy.

1447
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:49.000
My sister, Judy and my sister Helen.

1448
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
One of them worked on uniforms and one of them worked on guns.

1449
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
We were all in different areas.

1450
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It was a big factor over there.

1451
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.32
You know, this idea that you had of sticking together, of being a family and how that increases

1452
01:43:04.32 --> 01:43:09.000
your chances for survival.

1453
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:16.44
As I read that, it seemed a little bit counterintuitive to me because I always think, well,

1454
01:43:16.44 --> 01:43:20.24
if I just have to take care of myself, it seems like you'd be able to make more things

1455
01:43:20.24 --> 01:43:24.48
happen as opposed to you're looking out for other people.

1456
01:43:24.48 --> 01:43:28.84
But what I failed to realize and what I think is that because you're sticking together,

1457
01:43:28.84 --> 01:43:32.84
you're looking out for each other, you're keeping maybe you give a little bit of extra

1458
01:43:32.84 --> 01:43:36.60
bread, you share some bread so you're able to take care of each other and people that went

1459
01:43:36.60 --> 01:43:39.48
by themselves had less of a chance to survive.

1460
01:43:39.48 --> 01:43:40.48
Absolutely.

1461
01:43:40.48 --> 01:43:41.48
Absolutely.

1462
01:43:41.48 --> 01:43:45.36
A lot of women that came there to come that were alone.

1463
01:43:45.36 --> 01:43:50.36
I would say most of them didn't make it.

1464
01:43:50.36 --> 01:43:56.72
I think alone is so hard, but when you have your sisters, you know, at least you have

1465
01:43:56.72 --> 01:44:01.40
more hope to survive.

1466
01:44:01.40 --> 01:44:05.88
You say here, I'm always afraid that if I attract the attention of the guards, they will

1467
01:44:05.88 --> 01:44:09.28
realize I'm too skinny to work and will kill me.

1468
01:44:09.28 --> 01:44:11.52
Then who will help my sisters stay together?

1469
01:44:11.52 --> 01:44:14.16
I have to stay alive and do as Tata said.

1470
01:44:14.16 --> 01:44:17.24
After a month of the factory I gathered the courage to speak to the person in charge.

1471
01:44:17.24 --> 01:44:20.20
I'm going to take a deep breath before approaching the intimidating officer.

1472
01:44:20.20 --> 01:44:22.20
My handshake as he looks down to me.

1473
01:44:22.20 --> 01:44:27.48
I am still very short for my 14 years and with no heels or hair to help me seem taller,

1474
01:44:27.48 --> 01:44:29.56
I'm sure I look like a younger child.

1475
01:44:29.56 --> 01:44:33.68
This is hard work I say, shocked it out confident my voice sounds because my hands are shaking

1476
01:44:33.68 --> 01:44:36.72
I press them into my sides, hoping you won't notice.

1477
01:44:36.72 --> 01:44:39.12
I should get an extra meal to conserve my strength.

1478
01:44:39.12 --> 01:44:43.08
To my other surprise, the officer allows me an extra meal each day.

1479
01:44:43.08 --> 01:44:46.36
Yes, she did.

1480
01:44:46.36 --> 01:44:54.28
I would take it to the living quarters and I would share it with my sisters.

1481
01:44:54.28 --> 01:44:58.88
Over time my sisters and I realized that the German doctors and white codes conduct experiments

1482
01:44:58.88 --> 01:44:59.88
on the prisoners.

1483
01:44:59.88 --> 01:45:03.16
I don't remember the incident but my sisters tell me I was taken by one of the doctors

1484
01:45:03.16 --> 01:45:05.28
for several hours upon my return.

1485
01:45:05.28 --> 01:45:07.80
My mouth remained painful for several days.

1486
01:45:07.80 --> 01:45:11.32
I asked my sisters to look at my mouth to find out why it was so sore.

1487
01:45:11.32 --> 01:45:15.12
They noticed that all my teeth are drilled out and filled with something gray that looks

1488
01:45:15.12 --> 01:45:17.36
like street cement.

1489
01:45:17.36 --> 01:45:22.12
I cannot see inside my mouth because we have no mirrors but I had no feelings in my teeth

1490
01:45:22.12 --> 01:45:24.88
before coming to the factory.

1491
01:45:24.88 --> 01:45:26.96
The procedure is so awful I blocked it out.

1492
01:45:26.96 --> 01:45:30.20
It takes weeks for the pain to subside.

1493
01:45:30.20 --> 01:45:33.24
So that just a random, you get taken away.

1494
01:45:33.24 --> 01:45:38.08
Right, I may have complained that I had some pain in my teeth.

1495
01:45:38.08 --> 01:45:39.88
I'm not really sure about that.

1496
01:45:39.88 --> 01:45:48.60
When I was liberated I had my teeth filled with cement.

1497
01:45:48.60 --> 01:45:49.80
Our daily lives continue.

1498
01:45:49.80 --> 01:45:54.84
This is fast forwarding a bit and again people have to get the book to read it to get

1499
01:45:54.84 --> 01:46:01.88
all the details which are incredible to read, harrowing to read.

1500
01:46:01.88 --> 01:46:02.88
But I'm going to fast forward a bit.

1501
01:46:02.88 --> 01:46:06.76
You say our daily lives continue as each and every day we wake, eat, work, walk back

1502
01:46:06.76 --> 01:46:08.60
to our quarters, wash, eat and sleep.

1503
01:46:08.60 --> 01:46:11.80
It seems like a never ending monotony but we are grateful for it.

1504
01:46:11.80 --> 01:46:13.48
This routine feels safe.

1505
01:46:13.48 --> 01:46:18.24
Auschwitz had no predictability since any situation could turn into a nightmare in a second.

1506
01:46:18.24 --> 01:46:21.24
Safety is rare these days so we embraced as much as possible.

1507
01:46:21.24 --> 01:46:24.56
The guards mostly leave us alone unless someone steps out of line.

1508
01:46:24.56 --> 01:46:36.28
Hardly any of us do that anymore because we all recognize there is safety in submission.

1509
01:46:36.28 --> 01:46:41.96
I'm going to fall in love with more and again you tell some really fascinating stories about

1510
01:46:41.96 --> 01:46:48.80
what goes on inside and people need to get the book to see those to read about those.

1511
01:46:48.80 --> 01:46:52.28
I'm going to fast forward a bit after eight months of working and living at the factory

1512
01:46:52.28 --> 01:46:54.84
something starts to change.

1513
01:46:54.84 --> 01:46:57.04
I start to feel eyes watching me steadily.

1514
01:46:57.04 --> 01:47:01.36
I've known that the guards watch us but never felt this kind of observation.

1515
01:47:01.36 --> 01:47:05.24
I can feel their eyes on me watching like a hawk waiting for me to make a mistake.

1516
01:47:05.24 --> 01:47:08.80
I think they are planning to take me back to the camp and to my death.

1517
01:47:08.80 --> 01:47:13.64
One day I'm looking through the glass of a gas mask when RIVKA appears in front of me

1518
01:47:13.64 --> 01:47:15.12
in front of my distorted glass.

1519
01:47:15.12 --> 01:47:17.28
I'm so startled that I jump off my stool.

1520
01:47:17.28 --> 01:47:18.28
What are you doing?

1521
01:47:18.28 --> 01:47:21.04
They will see you, I hiss her.

1522
01:47:21.04 --> 01:47:23.000
She should not leave her place in the line.

1523
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Surely a guard will discover her and we will both get in trouble.

1524
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:27.24
Have you heard?

1525
01:47:27.24 --> 01:47:28.80
She asked in a whisper.

1526
01:47:28.80 --> 01:47:30.64
Herd what I ask confused.

1527
01:47:30.64 --> 01:47:33.20
Known as spoken to me at all that all day.

1528
01:47:33.20 --> 01:47:37.28
A part for my supervisor who barks orders at us once every hour.

1529
01:47:37.28 --> 01:47:38.48
We are to be marched.

1530
01:47:38.48 --> 01:47:39.48
She says gravely.

1531
01:47:39.48 --> 01:47:43.60
I have no idea what she means by that but from her face I know it is not good, marched.

1532
01:47:43.60 --> 01:47:44.60
Where?

1533
01:47:44.60 --> 01:47:45.60
By whom?

1534
01:47:45.60 --> 01:47:46.60
I don't know.

1535
01:47:46.60 --> 01:47:49.96
I heard some guards talking about how the Russians are coming.

1536
01:47:49.96 --> 01:47:50.96
She replies.

1537
01:47:50.96 --> 01:47:53.72
The word Russians makes my heart feel.

1538
01:47:53.72 --> 01:47:55.08
Makes my heart beat faster.

1539
01:47:55.08 --> 01:47:58.20
I know that they are fighting against the Germans for liberation.

1540
01:47:58.20 --> 01:48:00.36
But what does liberation look like?

1541
01:48:00.36 --> 01:48:01.36
No one knows.

1542
01:48:01.36 --> 01:48:07.84
Always that right now the Russians are the only people who want to get us out of this prison.

1543
01:48:07.84 --> 01:48:12.96
On May 6, 1945 we wake up to a gray gloomy morning and prepare for work.

1544
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:16.68
There is an odd energy running through the room as we make our way to the door to line

1545
01:48:16.68 --> 01:48:17.68
up.

1546
01:48:17.68 --> 01:48:19.12
I wonder why everyone is so jittery.

1547
01:48:19.12 --> 01:48:20.52
Are there extra guards outside?

1548
01:48:20.52 --> 01:48:21.52
Are they moving us?

1549
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:22.64
Are we going on the march?

1550
01:48:22.64 --> 01:48:25.96
We line up in front of the door like always.

1551
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:32.12
But instead of the silence that usually permeates the air, whispers fly along the line,

1552
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:33.12
what is happening?

1553
01:48:33.12 --> 01:48:35.20
Someone asks, are they sending us back to the camps?

1554
01:48:35.20 --> 01:48:38.64
I don't know where the guards, they should be here by now.

1555
01:48:38.64 --> 01:48:40.36
Another person answers.

1556
01:48:40.36 --> 01:48:41.84
One brave soul's ventures.

1557
01:48:41.84 --> 01:48:44.52
One brave soul ventures to the door after about 15 minutes.

1558
01:48:44.52 --> 01:48:45.72
All of us are nervous.

1559
01:48:45.72 --> 01:48:48.20
She opens the door and we see no one.

1560
01:48:48.20 --> 01:48:50.80
They usually lock doors, swings open without resistance.

1561
01:48:50.80 --> 01:48:53.88
We cautiously move out to the yard to find the gates to our quarters.

1562
01:48:53.88 --> 01:48:54.88
Why open?

1563
01:48:54.88 --> 01:48:58.12
Because never happened before and all of us are very worried.

1564
01:48:58.12 --> 01:49:00.92
We look around for the guards as we walk toward the gate.

1565
01:49:00.92 --> 01:49:05.12
There on the fence is a plain white bed sheet.

1566
01:49:05.12 --> 01:49:06.64
Someone wrote on it in German.

1567
01:49:06.64 --> 01:49:09.72
It reads, there will be no work for a few days.

1568
01:49:09.72 --> 01:49:12.32
There will be a march that all of you will be in.

1569
01:49:12.32 --> 01:49:15.64
Wait here until we come for you.

1570
01:49:15.64 --> 01:49:17.64
That's bizarre.

1571
01:49:17.64 --> 01:49:20.64
I didn't even remember that.

1572
01:49:20.64 --> 01:49:23.84
Did you see that?

1573
01:49:23.84 --> 01:49:28.84
Well, I know it said the guards didn't come to walk us to the factory.

1574
01:49:28.84 --> 01:49:35.80
After being hours and hours waiting, all these hours, I said to my sisters, I'm going

1575
01:49:35.80 --> 01:49:36.80
out.

1576
01:49:36.80 --> 01:49:38.52
I want to see what's going on.

1577
01:49:38.52 --> 01:49:40.36
I was probably the youngest kid in the group.

1578
01:49:40.36 --> 01:49:42.56
I was 300 women I believe.

1579
01:49:42.56 --> 01:49:48.24
I go outside and the fence, the gate to the fence.

1580
01:49:48.24 --> 01:49:50.24
Because we had electric fences surrounding us.

1581
01:49:50.24 --> 01:49:54.24
Why do I open the Germans run away?

1582
01:49:54.24 --> 01:49:55.24
Everybody ran away.

1583
01:49:55.24 --> 01:49:59.24
Here I am and all the women are in the building.

1584
01:49:59.24 --> 01:50:01.24
They're all afraid to come out.

1585
01:50:01.24 --> 01:50:03.24
I'm screaming at them actually.

1586
01:50:03.24 --> 01:50:04.24
They come out.

1587
01:50:04.24 --> 01:50:05.24
I think the SS is all run away.

1588
01:50:05.24 --> 01:50:07.24
I hear the planes going over us.

1589
01:50:07.24 --> 01:50:12.24
I hear the shooting of guns behind.

1590
01:50:12.24 --> 01:50:13.24
We were living.

1591
01:50:13.24 --> 01:50:16.24
They had all kinds of corn fields.

1592
01:50:16.24 --> 01:50:18.24
They were growing a lot of corn.

1593
01:50:18.24 --> 01:50:21.24
They came in.

1594
01:50:21.24 --> 01:50:23.24
I saw that.

1595
01:50:23.24 --> 01:50:26.24
I better go in front of the Russians.

1596
01:50:26.24 --> 01:50:33.24
They might think I'm German because I had heard already the same size here.

1597
01:50:33.24 --> 01:50:39.24
Regular clothes.

1598
01:50:39.24 --> 01:50:45.24
Being, I guess my hair was not that big.

1599
01:50:45.24 --> 01:50:49.24
But we did not have any marks on our dresses.

1600
01:50:49.24 --> 01:50:52.24
Saying who we are.

1601
01:50:52.24 --> 01:50:55.24
Maybe they think I'm German.

1602
01:50:55.24 --> 01:50:58.24
I tore a piece of my dress up.

1603
01:50:58.24 --> 01:51:03.24
I found a stick and I put that in front of the Russians.

1604
01:51:03.24 --> 01:51:05.24
What was the reaction?

1605
01:51:05.24 --> 01:51:08.24
They hugged me and kissed me.

1606
01:51:08.24 --> 01:51:11.24
I told them we have 300 women here.

1607
01:51:11.24 --> 01:51:13.24
They came to the Liberated House.

1608
01:51:13.24 --> 01:51:18.24
It was an amazing day.

1609
01:51:18.24 --> 01:51:21.24
Did you?

1610
01:51:21.24 --> 01:51:30.24
At that point, how long did it take you to realize that this was the end of everything you'd been through?

1611
01:51:30.24 --> 01:51:34.24
Well, we've been looking forward to this for so long.

1612
01:51:34.24 --> 01:51:36.24
It finally happened.

1613
01:51:36.24 --> 01:51:39.24
You stayed with your sisters the whole time.

1614
01:51:39.24 --> 01:51:41.24
Absolutely.

1615
01:51:41.24 --> 01:51:44.24
I don't know if I would have survived a lot of my sisters.

1616
01:51:44.24 --> 01:51:47.24
I don't have my sisters would have survived a lot.

1617
01:51:47.24 --> 01:51:50.24
Because I did things that nobody did.

1618
01:51:50.24 --> 01:51:58.24
You know, in a situation like this, you have to do certain things to survive.

1619
01:51:58.24 --> 01:52:03.24
You say in the book, this is the moment we had dreamed of hope for and waited long months to see.

1620
01:52:03.24 --> 01:52:06.24
It was as wonderful as any of the dreams I had.

1621
01:52:06.24 --> 01:52:08.24
All of us were overjoyed at the news.

1622
01:52:08.24 --> 01:52:10.24
We had waited so long to hear.

1623
01:52:10.24 --> 01:52:13.24
Helen.

1624
01:52:13.24 --> 01:52:18.24
Judy and I are survivors.

1625
01:52:18.24 --> 01:52:21.24
We are fine only free.

1626
01:52:21.24 --> 01:52:25.24
We stayed together like Tantas said because it would improve our chances for surviving.

1627
01:52:25.24 --> 01:52:26.24
He was right.

1628
01:52:26.24 --> 01:52:27.24
Yeah.

1629
01:52:27.24 --> 01:52:30.24
The Russians tell you, hey, go out in the town.

1630
01:52:30.24 --> 01:52:31.24
Take what you want.

1631
01:52:31.24 --> 01:52:32.24
Right.

1632
01:52:32.24 --> 01:52:33.24
They did.

1633
01:52:33.24 --> 01:52:35.24
But I didn't go alone.

1634
01:52:35.24 --> 01:52:37.24
I went with the Russians.

1635
01:52:37.24 --> 01:52:40.24
They were very good for us.

1636
01:52:40.24 --> 01:52:43.24
And were the Germans still in the houses or were they gone?

1637
01:52:43.24 --> 01:52:44.24
Oh, no.

1638
01:52:44.24 --> 01:52:45.24
They left.

1639
01:52:45.24 --> 01:52:46.24
Are you kidding?

1640
01:52:46.24 --> 01:52:47.24
They ran away.

1641
01:52:47.24 --> 01:52:51.24
As soon as the Russians saw the Russians say, all fled.

1642
01:52:51.24 --> 01:53:03.24
So you're just going from no food, no clothes and all of a sudden you're, yeah, normal food and everything.

1643
01:53:03.24 --> 01:53:04.24
Right away?

1644
01:53:04.24 --> 01:53:05.24
No food after that.

1645
01:53:05.24 --> 01:53:06.24
No.

1646
01:53:06.24 --> 01:53:08.24
No, but the Russians were very good to us.

1647
01:53:08.24 --> 01:53:13.24
They took us into town and they also brought food for us.

1648
01:53:13.24 --> 01:53:17.24
If we needed anything, they would get it for us.

1649
01:53:17.24 --> 01:53:26.24
So you, um, you eventually decide that you're going to head back to your home village.

1650
01:53:26.24 --> 01:53:27.24
Of course.

1651
01:53:27.24 --> 01:53:34.24
You say after four weeks on the trains, we finally arrive and walk to our little farm.

1652
01:53:34.24 --> 01:53:37.24
Our once beautiful and cozy home is hardy recognizable.

1653
01:53:37.24 --> 01:53:40.24
The roof is almost gone likely from a bomb.

1654
01:53:40.24 --> 01:53:42.24
All our belongings are gone.

1655
01:53:42.24 --> 01:53:45.24
They must have housed German horses in it since there was horse manure everywhere.

1656
01:53:45.24 --> 01:53:48.24
I remember where Tatsai hit the jewelry and I rushed to find it.

1657
01:53:48.24 --> 01:53:52.24
I'm relieved to find the spot is untouched even though the roof is largely gone.

1658
01:53:52.24 --> 01:53:55.24
I clawed the mud to uncover the shoe box.

1659
01:53:55.24 --> 01:53:58.24
When my fingertips tap a corner of the box,

1660
01:53:58.24 --> 01:54:02.24
I rapidly removed the mud to extract it relieved that it remained undiscovered.

1661
01:54:02.24 --> 01:54:06.24
I climbed down to show you key and how you saw her.

1662
01:54:06.24 --> 01:54:07.24
How you saw her.

1663
01:54:07.24 --> 01:54:08.24
How you saw her.

1664
01:54:08.24 --> 01:54:09.24
How you saw her.

1665
01:54:09.24 --> 01:54:10.24
How you saw her.

1666
01:54:10.24 --> 01:54:13.24
We sit down on our kitchen floor and carefully open the lid.

1667
01:54:13.24 --> 01:54:17.24
Inside is Tatsai's pocket watch chain, which is the one you're wearing right now.

1668
01:54:17.24 --> 01:54:20.24
My parents' wedding rings earrings in a couple of gold chains.

1669
01:54:20.24 --> 01:54:22.24
All of us cry at the discovery.

1670
01:54:22.24 --> 01:54:25.24
These are the only things that remain from our past.

1671
01:54:25.24 --> 01:54:33.24
You start to get news.

1672
01:54:33.24 --> 01:54:37.24
You start to get rumors and information.

1673
01:54:37.24 --> 01:54:40.24
One man reported that he knew nothing of Tatsai.

1674
01:54:40.24 --> 01:54:45.24
But was in a camp with fishel where they were, where they sewed SS uniforms.

1675
01:54:45.24 --> 01:54:47.24
He described how well my brother didn't camp.

1676
01:54:47.24 --> 01:54:52.24
Just days before the end of the war, all 300 men in his camp were marching to the forest.

1677
01:54:52.24 --> 01:54:57.24
And forced to dig a large hole. The Germans then stood them all at the edge of the hole and shot them.

1678
01:54:57.24 --> 01:54:59.24
Yeah.

1679
01:55:01.24 --> 01:55:03.24
As they fell into the hole, it became a mass grave.

1680
01:55:03.24 --> 01:55:08.24
The man told me that the Germans goal was to destroy any proof of what they did during the war.

1681
01:55:08.24 --> 01:55:13.24
So they made sure that there would be no survivors to talk about what happened in the camps.

1682
01:55:13.24 --> 01:55:14.24
Yeah.

1683
01:55:14.24 --> 01:55:16.24
I asked the man how he survived.

1684
01:55:16.24 --> 01:55:19.24
If everyone else died, he tells me that he was too ill to get up.

1685
01:55:19.24 --> 01:55:23.24
He hid in the back of the barracks and no one noticed him.

1686
01:55:23.24 --> 01:55:31.24
Poor fishel came within days of liberation, only to be slaughtered by the Nazis.

1687
01:55:31.24 --> 01:55:35.24
Later another local man returns with news of our father.

1688
01:55:35.24 --> 01:55:39.24
This man was with Tatsai in the factory where Tatsai had become very sick.

1689
01:55:39.24 --> 01:55:42.24
He had sores on his legs and that would not heal.

1690
01:55:42.24 --> 01:55:44.24
Because Tatsai did not recover and could not work.

1691
01:55:44.24 --> 01:55:49.24
They shipped them back to Auschwitz where he was murdered.

1692
01:55:49.24 --> 01:55:51.24
I repeatedly think about him in the injustice.

1693
01:55:51.24 --> 01:55:57.24
Wondering if he was scared, my brave intelligence, intelligent father's face swims in my mind.

1694
01:55:57.24 --> 01:56:00.24
I wonder if he thought of us before he died.

1695
01:56:00.24 --> 01:56:01.24
I'm sure he did.

1696
01:56:01.24 --> 01:56:03.24
Sure he did.

1697
01:56:03.24 --> 01:56:07.24
The fate of our immediate family is now clear.

1698
01:56:07.24 --> 01:56:13.24
Of the 11 Schwartz family members taken, there are only three who survived.

1699
01:56:13.24 --> 01:56:17.24
Over time we get word of our extended family.

1700
01:56:17.24 --> 01:56:25.24
Our wonderful family of nearly 150 is reduced to only 11 survivors.

1701
01:56:25.24 --> 01:56:27.24
Yep.

1702
01:56:31.24 --> 01:56:37.24
Unfortunately, I may be maybe even more than 150 people.

1703
01:56:37.24 --> 01:56:45.24
Because in those days, Jewish families, they did not believe in contraceptives.

1704
01:56:45.24 --> 01:56:49.24
They didn't use those and so everybody had a lot of kids.

1705
01:56:49.24 --> 01:56:56.24
My mother and my father, they each had three or four or maybe five sisters and brothers.

1706
01:56:56.24 --> 01:57:02.24
The only ones that came back, maybe it does not us.

1707
01:57:02.24 --> 01:57:08.24
That we know of.

1708
01:57:08.24 --> 01:57:12.24
They may have been other survivors that may not know about.

1709
01:57:12.24 --> 01:57:16.24
They lived in different places because in those days,

1710
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:18.24
they were not much.

1711
01:57:18.24 --> 01:57:22.24
When you lived in different cities, we did not keep in touch too much.

1712
01:57:22.24 --> 01:57:31.24
So, you hear about the central British fund.

1713
01:57:31.24 --> 01:57:32.24
Right.

1714
01:57:32.24 --> 01:57:42.24
And they have a program where they're taking orphaned survivor children from the Holocaust and bringing them to England.

1715
01:57:42.24 --> 01:57:43.24
Right.

1716
01:57:43.24 --> 01:57:47.24
And you apply for this program.

1717
01:57:47.24 --> 01:57:51.24
This is, it says, so they're called the CF CBF.

1718
01:57:51.24 --> 01:57:58.24
Despite the CBF's attempt to gather 1,000 survivor orphans, they can only locate 701.

1719
01:57:58.24 --> 01:58:02.24
And they're all kids running.

1720
01:58:02.24 --> 01:58:10.24
On February 19, 1946, I joined the last transport of survivors to load into a royal air force planes.

1721
01:58:10.24 --> 01:58:13.24
They were all bomber planes.

1722
01:58:13.24 --> 01:58:16.24
They used to use for transporting us.

1723
01:58:16.24 --> 01:58:19.24
The first transport started in August of 1945.

1724
01:58:19.24 --> 01:58:24.24
And the last transport was 1946 of February 12th.

1725
01:58:24.24 --> 01:58:27.24
And I was in the last transport.

1726
01:58:27.24 --> 01:58:30.24
And so there was only 732.

1727
01:58:30.24 --> 01:58:31.24
Yes.

1728
01:58:31.24 --> 01:58:33.24
That's all they could find.

1729
01:58:33.24 --> 01:58:36.24
Or only that register for the program.

1730
01:58:36.24 --> 01:58:38.24
So maybe they were more.

1731
01:58:38.24 --> 01:58:41.24
But I don't know why they didn't register.

1732
01:58:41.24 --> 01:58:48.24
So you fly across and you end up in Scotland.

1733
01:58:48.24 --> 01:58:51.24
Scotland at the Pultenhouse.

1734
01:58:51.24 --> 01:58:52.24
Right.

1735
01:58:52.24 --> 01:58:55.24
And last week, that was called last week.

1736
01:58:55.24 --> 01:59:03.24
You see, here in this unexpected start to a new life, we have no parents and most of us have no siblings, but we have each other.

1737
01:59:03.24 --> 01:59:04.24
Right.

1738
01:59:04.24 --> 01:59:05.24
We all stick together.

1739
01:59:05.24 --> 01:59:06.24
We become like family.

1740
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:11.24
This simple life falls into a pattern of predictable, safe days, which comforts all of us.

1741
01:59:11.24 --> 01:59:13.24
We are encouraged to have fun and relax together.

1742
01:59:13.24 --> 01:59:19.24
All of us are equal to eager to feel normal again with our new family.

1743
01:59:19.24 --> 01:59:21.24
Our days are routine and comforting.

1744
01:59:21.24 --> 01:59:25.24
The counselors talked to us about our new life and what to expect now.

1745
01:59:25.24 --> 01:59:27.24
We need a long term plan.

1746
01:59:32.24 --> 01:59:35.24
The only plans we had is hopefully going.

1747
01:59:35.24 --> 01:59:40.24
Getting coming to America, we're going to Israel.

1748
01:59:40.24 --> 01:59:41.24
Okay.

1749
01:59:41.24 --> 01:59:51.24
Because all our city said we came from the past.

1750
01:59:55.24 --> 02:00:09.24
When, like I said, there's both both you and Max have sections in this book and the max is section.

1751
02:00:09.24 --> 02:00:12.24
Good, describes what he went through.

1752
02:00:12.24 --> 02:00:13.24
Right.

1753
02:00:13.24 --> 02:00:20.24
And, you know, it's a similar start and he dict his nail to the trees around the village that all Jews report to the nearby ghetto.

1754
02:00:20.24 --> 02:00:31.24
His dad does a pretty good maneuver where he basically bribes one of the Germans and says,

1755
02:00:31.24 --> 02:00:43.24
My family can work. All of us can work and gets the whole family sent to Commando Flaws and Burke, which is a forced labor company.

1756
02:00:43.24 --> 02:00:52.24
And he says, they go into this kind of self-contained, all Jewish work camp.

1757
02:00:52.24 --> 02:00:57.24
And even though they don't get paid, like they're not being tortured.

1758
02:00:57.24 --> 02:01:01.24
They leave you this as a good thing that they're in this forced labor camp.

1759
02:01:01.24 --> 02:01:01.24
Right.

1760
02:01:01.24 --> 02:01:03.24
They need their labor.

1761
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:05.24
Also.

1762
02:01:07.24 --> 02:01:13.24
He works there for about a year.

1763
02:01:13.24 --> 02:01:19.24
And then they get told that they're going to get moved.

1764
02:01:19.24 --> 02:01:23.24
So they have to break down all the equipment that they're using in this factory.

1765
02:01:23.24 --> 02:01:30.24
And they're going to move it from the trucks to a salt mine, which was a bad decision by the Germans,

1766
02:01:30.24 --> 02:01:34.24
because inside the salt mine, all the equipment starts to rust almost immediately.

1767
02:01:34.24 --> 02:01:40.24
So they have to break it down and pack it up again, which they do.

1768
02:01:40.24 --> 02:01:45.24
And then they get shipped off again.

1769
02:01:45.24 --> 02:01:47.24
I'll read this little section here.

1770
02:01:47.24 --> 02:01:51.24
Soon after dawning our blue and white uniform, we enter a long line that moves very slowly.

1771
02:01:51.24 --> 02:01:53.24
Each person exits the front of the line.

1772
02:01:53.24 --> 02:01:55.24
I can see them examining their forearm.

1773
02:01:55.24 --> 02:01:58.24
One man shows us his forearm.

1774
02:01:58.24 --> 02:02:00.24
And blurt's in Yiddish.

1775
02:02:00.24 --> 02:02:02.24
They are tattooing these letters on our arms.

1776
02:02:02.24 --> 02:02:03.24
How will God view this?

1777
02:02:03.24 --> 02:02:05.24
He must be in Orthodox Jew.

1778
02:02:05.24 --> 02:02:07.24
Our faith forbids us to have tattoos.

1779
02:02:07.24 --> 02:02:12.24
In this moment, I am thankful that we are not Orthodox and we're raised to be more relaxed about our faith.

1780
02:02:12.24 --> 02:02:14.24
I can see the pain on the man's face.

1781
02:02:14.24 --> 02:02:18.24
Data shares him, God would never punish you for something you cannot control.

1782
02:02:18.24 --> 02:02:21.24
The tattoo on his forearm says KL.

1783
02:02:21.24 --> 02:02:23.24
I intend to find out what that means.

1784
02:02:23.24 --> 02:02:25.24
So we are waiting in line for a tattoo.

1785
02:02:25.24 --> 02:02:29.24
I wonder why we need a tattoo here if we didn't need one at the last camp.

1786
02:02:29.24 --> 02:02:33.24
This new camp is worse in so many ways already.

1787
02:02:33.24 --> 02:02:41.24
Data and the other men quickly find out from the inmates that KL is shortened from the word concentration logger.

1788
02:02:41.24 --> 02:02:43.24
Consentratio's logger.

1789
02:02:43.24 --> 02:02:45.24
Consentrational concentration.

1790
02:02:45.24 --> 02:02:50.24
The tattoo identifies us as prisoners of a concentration camp.

1791
02:02:50.24 --> 02:02:55.24
Dad feared we would end up here.

1792
02:02:55.24 --> 02:03:00.24
So, Max ends up in a worker.

1793
02:03:00.24 --> 02:03:03.24
He's only 14 years old.

1794
02:03:03.24 --> 02:03:04.24
He's only 14 years old.

1795
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:07.24
He's an inside of airplane wings.

1796
02:03:07.24 --> 02:03:11.24
He says the pole's hate us.

1797
02:03:11.24 --> 02:03:16.24
He's not helping us in any way.

1798
02:03:16.24 --> 02:03:19.24
He's working alongside of Polish people.

1799
02:03:19.24 --> 02:03:23.24
Normal, normal, civilians.

1800
02:03:23.24 --> 02:03:26.24
Every night we lay on the straw, teaming with lights and bed bugs.

1801
02:03:26.24 --> 02:03:31.24
There are 300 boys and men, per bearer, all of whom are suffering the same challenges.

1802
02:03:31.24 --> 02:03:34.24
Bug bites make it difficult to sleep at night.

1803
02:03:34.24 --> 02:03:36.24
In a daytime they cause itch irritation.

1804
02:03:36.24 --> 02:03:40.24
In addition, we must wear the same uniform for a month before we get a new one.

1805
02:03:40.24 --> 02:03:42.24
We're rid of the bugs as impossible.

1806
02:03:42.24 --> 02:03:44.24
Sanitation in the K-Labor camp is awful.

1807
02:03:44.24 --> 02:03:47.24
There's a cold water trough where we rinse our hands and face.

1808
02:03:47.24 --> 02:03:48.24
There's no soap.

1809
02:03:48.24 --> 02:03:49.24
There are no showers.

1810
02:03:49.24 --> 02:03:52.24
The trains are pits with a wooden board over them.

1811
02:03:52.24 --> 02:03:54.24
The board has a round opening for us to squat over.

1812
02:03:54.24 --> 02:03:56.24
But there's no toilet paper.

1813
02:03:56.24 --> 02:03:57.24
So many people use the latrine.

1814
02:03:57.24 --> 02:03:58.24
It always stinks.

1815
02:03:58.24 --> 02:04:00.24
Jewish inmates are assigned to clean it.

1816
02:04:00.24 --> 02:04:04.24
In fact, I realize now that Jews are doing all the work in the camp.

1817
02:04:04.24 --> 02:04:06.24
The guards are just directing them.

1818
02:04:06.24 --> 02:04:12.24
Lunch is a bowl of soup.

1819
02:04:12.24 --> 02:04:16.24
Dinner is three or four ounces of bread.

1820
02:04:16.24 --> 02:04:20.24
Everyone in the camp is weak and malnourished.

1821
02:04:20.24 --> 02:04:26.24
We go to work no matter what everyone knows prisoners who cannot work are shot or sent to the gas chamber.

1822
02:04:26.24 --> 02:04:32.24
Yes, they didn't keep us here to have a good time.

1823
02:04:32.24 --> 02:04:40.24
And it's up in another concentration camp called Plaza Plaza.

1824
02:04:40.24 --> 02:04:41.24
Plaza.

1825
02:04:41.24 --> 02:04:42.24
Plaza.

1826
02:04:42.24 --> 02:04:50.24
The room in the camp is that the Russians are now close to Warsaw and are threatening to override the Germans.

1827
02:04:50.24 --> 02:04:52.24
The allies are coming.

1828
02:04:52.24 --> 02:04:54.24
Poland and Germany are bracing for attack.

1829
02:04:54.24 --> 02:04:56.24
The soldiers here are more tense than at the other camps.

1830
02:04:56.24 --> 02:05:01.24
We need to be very careful not to test their patients because they become more explosive with every little

1831
02:05:01.24 --> 02:05:04.24
provocation now.

1832
02:05:04.24 --> 02:05:07.24
At this camp, we are to do work not in a factory.

1833
02:05:07.24 --> 02:05:18.24
Instead, we move around the city to dig ditches and build fortifications for the German troops.

1834
02:05:18.24 --> 02:05:24.24
Once again, you're doing something that's going to help the people that are torturing you and killing you.

1835
02:05:24.24 --> 02:05:27.24
We have no choice.

1836
02:05:27.24 --> 02:05:33.24
And it's up getting moved again.

1837
02:05:33.24 --> 02:05:37.24
And again, you got to read this book to get this story.

1838
02:05:37.24 --> 02:05:41.24
I'm going through the high points of it right now or the low points of gas.

1839
02:05:41.24 --> 02:05:48.24
But in the end, he gets transport again and Auschwitz is the destination.

1840
02:05:48.24 --> 02:05:54.24
But the train comes to rest in your Dresden.

1841
02:05:54.24 --> 02:05:57.24
We remain at this location for nearly a year.

1842
02:05:57.24 --> 02:05:58.24
We work in the factory.

1843
02:05:58.24 --> 02:06:02.24
Our work in the factory is consistent and comfortably predictable.

1844
02:06:02.24 --> 02:06:06.24
We hear with increase in frequency from the great vine that the allies are closer.

1845
02:06:06.24 --> 02:06:12.24
Even some of the local Germans talk about what will happen if allies enter Dresden.

1846
02:06:12.24 --> 02:06:18.24
The night of February 13, 1945, the allies saturation bombing of Dresden begins.

1847
02:06:18.24 --> 02:06:22.24
The sky lights up with flares from the first wave of planes.

1848
02:06:22.24 --> 02:06:28.24
Subsequent waves of bombers drop phosphorus bombs that cause fires after exposing the entire city

1849
02:06:28.24 --> 02:06:30.24
as become a giant torch.

1850
02:06:30.24 --> 02:06:34.24
When our factory housing gets hit, fire spreads quickly.

1851
02:06:34.24 --> 02:06:39.24
Pandemonium breaks out as we prisoners run down the stairs to the bomb shelters.

1852
02:06:39.24 --> 02:06:45.24
The words survive, survive, survive, repeat my head like a comforting chant.

1853
02:06:45.24 --> 02:06:47.24
Two days later, the bombing is fine.

1854
02:06:47.24 --> 02:06:51.24
The overall when we crawl out of the bomb shelter, we see that the factory is half gone.

1855
02:06:51.24 --> 02:06:54.24
The accommodations upstairs for the inmates is lost.

1856
02:06:54.24 --> 02:06:55.24
We must now sleep with no roof.

1857
02:06:55.24 --> 02:06:59.24
It's literally freezing temperatures and we have no blankets.

1858
02:06:59.24 --> 02:07:07.24
So yeah, that's the bombing of Dresden, which was historical.

1859
02:07:07.24 --> 02:07:12.24
They bombed with these incendiary bombs, which caught fire.

1860
02:07:12.24 --> 02:07:18.24
I want to say 250,000 people were killed in that bombing.

1861
02:07:18.24 --> 02:07:22.24
Probably. And a lot of civilians, mostly civilians.

1862
02:07:22.24 --> 02:07:26.24
And people look at that in various different ways.

1863
02:07:26.24 --> 02:07:29.24
But at this point in the war, it was a decision that was made.

1864
02:07:29.24 --> 02:07:32.24
I think Churchill really drove that decision.

1865
02:07:32.24 --> 02:07:36.24
Because the Germans, the Nazis had been bombing and killing civilians in England.

1866
02:07:36.24 --> 02:07:38.24
Right. And he said, OK.

1867
02:07:38.24 --> 02:07:39.24
Well, our turn.

1868
02:07:39.24 --> 02:07:40.24
Yep.

1869
02:07:40.24 --> 02:07:41.24
And that's what they did.

1870
02:07:41.24 --> 02:07:44.24
And of course, Kurt Vonnegut, saw her house five.

1871
02:07:44.24 --> 02:07:50.24
She's about coming out of the POW camps, prisons, prison camps.

1872
02:07:50.24 --> 02:07:52.24
After that as well.

1873
02:07:52.24 --> 02:07:56.24
Because everything was just destroyed.

1874
02:07:56.24 --> 02:08:00.24
They were bombing that city for two days.

1875
02:08:00.24 --> 02:08:08.24
The EGETS moved around again.

1876
02:08:08.24 --> 02:08:12.24
And yeah.

1877
02:08:12.24 --> 02:08:19.24
They go on a, they get marched.

1878
02:08:19.24 --> 02:08:20.24
Right.

1879
02:08:20.24 --> 02:08:23.24
They go on a, and I got, I got to read this section.

1880
02:08:23.24 --> 02:08:26.24
After a few days, the German SS soldiers with their guns on their soldiers

1881
02:08:26.24 --> 02:08:28.24
Round up the commandow group.

1882
02:08:28.24 --> 02:08:31.24
And this is them. The commandow forels in Berg group.

1883
02:08:31.24 --> 02:08:33.24
Again, we set off on a forced march.

1884
02:08:33.24 --> 02:08:39.24
We are 300 to 350 men marching through the forest into Czechoslovakia.

1885
02:08:39.24 --> 02:08:42.24
The march takes a few weeks, but feels more like a year,

1886
02:08:42.24 --> 02:08:44.24
and it is ghastly for our group.

1887
02:08:44.24 --> 02:08:48.24
We march on one side of the river, watching bombs exploding the other side.

1888
02:08:48.24 --> 02:08:52.24
With snow on the ground, all of us are freezing as we climb up the mountains.

1889
02:08:52.24 --> 02:08:56.24
I can't feel my toes and try to walk with my hands tucked into my own pits.

1890
02:08:56.24 --> 02:08:59.24
We get very little to eat, and we are all starving.

1891
02:08:59.24 --> 02:09:02.24
We march through several towns as people stand on the side of the road

1892
02:09:02.24 --> 02:09:04.24
and silently watch.

1893
02:09:04.24 --> 02:09:08.24
We are told not to speak to the towns people or accept anything from them or else we will be shot.

1894
02:09:08.24 --> 02:09:10.24
Not one person offers us anything.

1895
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:12.24
No food or jackets or boots or blankets.

1896
02:09:12.24 --> 02:09:19.24
It is a disastrous death march from bombed out dressed in two little mirries.

1897
02:09:19.24 --> 02:09:25.24
I see men fall, give up and die, or sit down and refuse to go on.

1898
02:09:25.24 --> 02:09:28.24
These people are all shot.

1899
02:09:28.24 --> 02:09:31.24
Dad's health declines, and he is in bad shape.

1900
02:09:31.24 --> 02:09:34.24
He is very weak and cannot walk alone.

1901
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:39.24
Fred and I support him on either side with his arms over our shoulders.

1902
02:09:39.24 --> 02:09:43.24
We get tired after hours of assisting him with other men.

1903
02:09:43.24 --> 02:09:46.24
When we get tired after hours of assisting him,

1904
02:09:46.24 --> 02:09:49.24
other men from our group help hold him up.

1905
02:09:49.24 --> 02:09:53.24
The German stuff us in a barn in a sub camp

1906
02:09:53.24 --> 02:09:57.24
are first two nights after the death march.

1907
02:09:57.24 --> 02:10:02.24
At long last, we are given a small amount of food, which is our first food in eight to ten days.

1908
02:10:02.24 --> 02:10:06.24
We sleep on the dirt floors, squash together to try and stay warm.

1909
02:10:06.24 --> 02:10:08.24
Our first night's sleep in almost ten days.

1910
02:10:08.24 --> 02:10:13.24
No one cares about the important living conditions, and we are completely exhausted and barely alive.

1911
02:10:13.24 --> 02:10:19.24
Two days later, when we arrive at the ghetto in late March of 1945,

1912
02:10:19.24 --> 02:10:26.24
they are only about 80 of our group who are still alive after the four-step march.

1913
02:10:26.24 --> 02:10:28.24
The rest are dead.

1914
02:10:28.24 --> 02:10:31.24
Out of 300.

1915
02:10:40.24 --> 02:10:47.24
So, I mean at this point, they are putting to another camp, you know,

1916
02:10:47.24 --> 02:10:50.24
Max, as here, everyone is near death completely exhausted.

1917
02:10:50.24 --> 02:10:51.24
It's starving.

1918
02:10:51.24 --> 02:10:54.24
The camp is overcrowded, filthy, and disorganized.

1919
02:10:54.24 --> 02:11:02.24
They get march to a place called the Small Fortress, which was just another nightmarish hell.

1920
02:11:02.24 --> 02:11:19.24
On May 8th, and again, I'm skipping forward, but you got to get this book to read through what actually happened.

1921
02:11:19.24 --> 02:11:26.24
On May 8th, 1945, Soviet troops enter the small fortress to liberate the camps.

1922
02:11:26.24 --> 02:11:27.24
And Teraisenstadt.

1923
02:11:27.24 --> 02:11:29.24
And Teraisenstadt.

1924
02:11:29.24 --> 02:11:31.24
What is that the name of the town?

1925
02:11:31.24 --> 02:11:33.24
Teraisen.

1926
02:11:33.24 --> 02:11:36.24
Could this be the day we have waited so long for.

1927
02:11:36.24 --> 02:11:38.24
The troops are indeed here to liberate us.

1928
02:11:38.24 --> 02:11:41.24
Our imprisonment at the hands of the Germans over at last,

1929
02:11:41.24 --> 02:11:45.24
even the weakest of us is celebrating to know we are finally finally free.

1930
02:11:45.24 --> 02:11:46.24
We did survive.

1931
02:11:46.24 --> 02:11:48.24
We are no longer captives.

1932
02:11:48.24 --> 02:11:50.24
Prisoners and slaves to the German Nazis.

1933
02:11:50.24 --> 02:11:51.24
The three of us.

1934
02:11:51.24 --> 02:11:54.24
So, it's Max Fred and the Dad.

1935
02:11:54.24 --> 02:11:55.24
They're Dad.

1936
02:11:55.24 --> 02:11:57.24
Despite all the odds have survived.

1937
02:11:57.24 --> 02:12:01.24
Two today's liberation although Dad is very likely a death store.

1938
02:12:01.24 --> 02:12:02.24
Yeah.

1939
02:12:02.24 --> 02:12:05.24
I can now proudly wear Dad's gold watch chain rather than hide it.

1940
02:12:05.24 --> 02:12:08.24
And again, there's an incredible story.

1941
02:12:08.24 --> 02:12:14.24
And it's a similar story to yours in that your dad, Max's Dad, had a chain.

1942
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:17.24
Except for Max kept it with him the whole time.

1943
02:12:17.24 --> 02:12:18.24
Right.

1944
02:12:18.24 --> 02:12:23.24
And him and his brother Fred traded it back and forth and kept it and hit it over all that time.

1945
02:12:23.24 --> 02:12:28.24
And now he's able to take that watch chain out and actually wear it.

1946
02:12:28.24 --> 02:12:33.24
He says this week slowly came to the realization that Dad did not survive the

1947
02:12:33.24 --> 02:12:35.24
Typhus epidemic.

1948
02:12:35.24 --> 02:12:37.24
Fred and I share a long knowing look.

1949
02:12:37.24 --> 02:12:38.24
We both know.

1950
02:12:38.24 --> 02:12:39.24
I can see it.

1951
02:12:39.24 --> 02:12:40.24
His eyes.

1952
02:12:40.24 --> 02:12:41.24
Benjamin Schindler is dead.

1953
02:12:41.24 --> 02:12:45.24
After a quiet period we begin talking about what likely happened.

1954
02:12:45.24 --> 02:12:48.24
I hope that Dad lived long enough to know liberation.

1955
02:12:48.24 --> 02:12:53.24
Fred believes this is true.

1956
02:12:53.24 --> 02:12:57.24
He says after liberation people wander around looking confused, relieved, and angry,

1957
02:12:57.24 --> 02:13:03.24
and all have questions about their loved ones.

1958
02:13:03.24 --> 02:13:04.24
Yeah.

1959
02:13:04.24 --> 02:13:08.24
Max and Fred they were, they were came down the Typhoid.

1960
02:13:08.24 --> 02:13:12.24
So they kept them six weeks in one place.

1961
02:13:12.24 --> 02:13:17.24
And by the time they came out of this disease,

1962
02:13:17.24 --> 02:13:19.24
they could get up and go outside.

1963
02:13:19.24 --> 02:13:21.24
They looked for the father and there was no one.

1964
02:13:21.24 --> 02:13:23.24
Couldn't find them anywhere.

1965
02:13:23.24 --> 02:13:27.24
So a lot of people died after liberation.

1966
02:13:27.24 --> 02:13:30.24
And they buried a lot of people in Tyrazine.

1967
02:13:30.24 --> 02:13:34.24
But they had no names because none of us had names in the camps.

1968
02:13:34.24 --> 02:13:39.24
I mean when we were in Tyrazine and in Freud and Talb, we had the names.

1969
02:13:39.24 --> 02:13:43.24
But we didn't have it on our clothes or anything.

1970
02:13:43.24 --> 02:13:46.24
No way, Tyrazine.

1971
02:13:46.24 --> 02:13:49.24
No family to identify.

1972
02:13:49.24 --> 02:13:51.24
No family to identify.

1973
02:13:51.24 --> 02:13:53.24
Someone died.

1974
02:13:53.24 --> 02:13:55.24
That's it.

1975
02:13:55.24 --> 02:13:57.24
Nameless body.

1976
02:13:57.24 --> 02:13:58.24
Right.

1977
02:13:58.24 --> 02:14:01.24
So that's what happened to Max's father.

1978
02:14:01.24 --> 02:14:10.24
He says here with the help of the red cross we find out that mom and Cecilia went to Stutthoff.

1979
02:14:10.24 --> 02:14:12.24
Stutthoff, a camp in East Prussia.

1980
02:14:12.24 --> 02:14:17.24
That concentration camp reportedly expanded several times, adding more barracks and extermination

1981
02:14:17.24 --> 02:14:19.24
chambers during the war.

1982
02:14:19.24 --> 02:14:26.24
They tell us that Rishallah, Rishallah, Rishallah and Cecilia Shinder, Shindler, were killed there.

1983
02:14:26.24 --> 02:14:32.24
Just before liberation, all surviving inmates were loaded on the barges, pushed out into the Baltic Sea,

1984
02:14:32.24 --> 02:14:37.24
and were deliberately sunk.

1985
02:14:37.24 --> 02:14:42.24
It was realized we worried about mom and Cecilia's safety every day.

1986
02:14:42.24 --> 02:14:46.24
We were suffering in the camps keeping hope alive that they would survive.

1987
02:14:46.24 --> 02:14:49.24
Learning with certainty that they are dead as a tremendous blow.

1988
02:14:49.24 --> 02:14:51.24
The red cross is also investigated.

1989
02:14:51.24 --> 02:14:56.24
The red cross also investigated our family and Poland that went into the ghetto.

1990
02:14:56.24 --> 02:15:02.24
They tell us that our cousins, aunts, uncles and grandma, Shreed, saying the right

1991
02:15:02.24 --> 02:15:07.24
Shreed, Shreed, were all killed. None of them survived.

1992
02:15:07.24 --> 02:15:12.24
We also find out that our dear grandpa Shindler refused to go into a ghetto when the Jews were

1993
02:15:12.24 --> 02:15:16.24
rounded up in 1942. He was shot in the street near his home.

1994
02:15:16.24 --> 02:15:17.24
Right.

1995
02:15:17.24 --> 02:15:20.24
A 90 years old, he refused to leave his home.

1996
02:15:20.24 --> 02:15:27.24
We now know that our whole family is gone, murdered by the German Nazis.

1997
02:15:27.24 --> 02:15:34.24
Dad is dead. Mom and Cecilia are gone. Our extended family no longer exists.

1998
02:15:34.24 --> 02:15:37.24
It is just Fred and me in the world.

1999
02:15:37.24 --> 02:15:58.24
All that remains from our former life is the gold chain that Dad wore to hold his watch.

2000
02:15:58.24 --> 02:16:00.24
It's not a newsy book to read.

2001
02:16:00.24 --> 02:16:05.24
No, it's not.

2002
02:16:05.24 --> 02:16:15.24
I read it so many times and yet every time I break out in the years I can't help it.

2003
02:16:15.24 --> 02:16:20.24
I mean both, both, you know.

2004
02:16:20.24 --> 02:16:30.24
To hear and read about both of your family and Max's family, the entire family's gone.

2005
02:16:30.24 --> 02:16:36.24
For no reason just because I were Jewish.

2006
02:16:36.24 --> 02:16:38.24
The world doesn't realize what they've lost.

2007
02:16:38.24 --> 02:16:46.24
Who knows? Maybe one of those people could have been a doctor who would have found cure for cancer.

2008
02:16:46.24 --> 02:17:00.24
Because we believe a lot of them are in education.

2009
02:17:00.24 --> 02:17:11.24
Max finds out about the same program that you were enrolled into of looking for orphan survivors.

2010
02:17:11.24 --> 02:17:17.24
And the Max's marriage for that group is 16, Fred is 17.

2011
02:17:17.24 --> 02:17:21.24
So Fred Max decided to go live about their ages to get in there.

2012
02:17:21.24 --> 02:17:24.24
We had no IDs. We had nothing.

2013
02:17:24.24 --> 02:17:29.24
We had was the clothes on our bodies. Nothing else.

2014
02:17:29.24 --> 02:17:33.24
No identification of any kind.

2015
02:17:33.24 --> 02:17:47.24
So Max gets to England and again, you just got to read the book to go through that transition of what it's like to go from a concentration camp to England.

2016
02:17:47.24 --> 02:17:48.24
Right.

2017
02:17:48.24 --> 02:17:54.24
With white sheets and white bread and he's got a part of there where he explains he thinks white bread is basically like cake.

2018
02:17:54.24 --> 02:18:00.24
He thinks they're making sandwiches on cake because it tastes so delicious to it.

2019
02:18:00.24 --> 02:18:04.24
Yeah, just it's a really it's just powerful.

2020
02:18:04.24 --> 02:18:10.24
And you know, one of the things that I I called out in here is that he says we attend school.

2021
02:18:10.24 --> 02:18:16.24
We attended organization and read for rehabilitation and training school.

2022
02:18:16.24 --> 02:18:20.24
For half a day, five days a week, the school is designed to prepare us for life and work.

2023
02:18:20.24 --> 02:18:26.24
And you know, I just read that as his focus and it seems like everyone's focus was like, okay, we're going to move forward.

2024
02:18:26.24 --> 02:18:29.24
We got to find a new job. We got to find out how we're going to put our lives together.

2025
02:18:29.24 --> 02:18:33.24
You have to do that if you don't do your last.

2026
02:18:33.24 --> 02:18:42.24
And there's also what's the name of Mr. Montefior.

2027
02:18:42.24 --> 02:18:44.24
Am I saying that right?

2028
02:18:44.24 --> 02:18:45.24
Montefioral.

2029
02:18:45.24 --> 02:18:47.24
And what was his position?

2030
02:18:47.24 --> 02:18:53.24
He was a wealthy Jewish philanthropist in London.

2031
02:18:53.24 --> 02:18:57.24
And he offered to take us to England.

2032
02:18:57.24 --> 02:19:01.24
He was kind of supplying a lot of financial backing behind absolutely.

2033
02:19:01.24 --> 02:19:05.24
Yes.

2034
02:19:05.24 --> 02:19:09.24
Actually, Sir Leonard Montefioro walked me down the island.

2035
02:19:09.24 --> 02:19:13.24
We got married in London because I had no parents.

2036
02:19:13.24 --> 02:19:17.24
And so he offered to do that.

2037
02:19:17.24 --> 02:19:23.24
Yeah, I know that's why I definitely wanted to call out his name because I knew he was an important figure to ever to all of you.

2038
02:19:23.24 --> 02:19:31.24
Oh, yes. He was a very important person in England and very important person in Israel.

2039
02:19:31.24 --> 02:19:33.24
Have you ever been to Israel?

2040
02:19:33.24 --> 02:19:34.24
I have not.

2041
02:19:34.24 --> 02:19:47.24
In Israel, many of the cities have a lot of Sir Leonard Montefioros all over the place, but he built this and he built that and all kinds of things.

2042
02:19:47.24 --> 02:19:59.24
There's a great line in here again. It's the counselors tell us that we did not deserve the suffering that we endured that it cannot stop us now and that we can be anything we want to if we are willing to work hard.

2043
02:19:59.24 --> 02:20:00.24
Right.

2044
02:20:00.24 --> 02:20:06.24
Which is just, you know, again, the mentality of look.

2045
02:20:06.24 --> 02:20:08.24
We've got to move forward.

2046
02:20:08.24 --> 02:20:11.24
And also, it's interesting.

2047
02:20:11.24 --> 02:20:14.24
You can be anything you want, but you still have to be willing to work hard.

2048
02:20:14.24 --> 02:20:18.24
Even after everything you've been through, you're still going to have to get out there and continue.

2049
02:20:18.24 --> 02:20:19.24
Absolutely.

2050
02:20:19.24 --> 02:20:24.24
And we did and we did all of us. Let me tell you something.

2051
02:20:24.24 --> 02:20:35.24
If you're going to come to all the survivors that's remained from all the people that have killed and that came to this United States, okay?

2052
02:20:35.24 --> 02:20:41.24
I bet you're not one would have gone on welfare because the first thing they did get a job.

2053
02:20:41.24 --> 02:20:44.24
Okay.

2054
02:20:44.24 --> 02:20:47.24
Our education was very low.

2055
02:20:47.24 --> 02:20:49.24
I mean, I had three and a half years of education.

2056
02:20:49.24 --> 02:20:52.24
I'm close to four years of education.

2057
02:20:52.24 --> 02:20:58.24
I never even thought of going back to school and it wasn't even on my mind.

2058
02:20:58.24 --> 02:21:03.24
First of all, in Europe, we only had education till the age of 14.

2059
02:21:03.24 --> 02:21:08.24
Even though I didn't have it in Europe because we couldn't go after I was like nine years old.

2060
02:21:08.24 --> 02:21:13.24
But we all were very hard to get, very VR.

2061
02:21:13.24 --> 02:21:16.24
Okay.

2062
02:21:16.24 --> 02:21:23.24
You do a great job of going through like kind of how all this stuff unfolds.

2063
02:21:23.24 --> 02:21:31.24
And it's really just a beautiful part of the book when there's five of you girls that show up in where is it?

2064
02:21:31.24 --> 02:21:32.24
Bedford hostel.

2065
02:21:32.24 --> 02:21:33.24
Bedstool.

2066
02:21:33.24 --> 02:21:36.24
And it's a bunch of a bunch of the young men survivors.

2067
02:21:36.24 --> 02:21:44.24
That's when you, well, that's when you meet one handsome young gentleman who says hello on Max and his mother, Fred.

2068
02:21:44.24 --> 02:21:48.24
Welcome to Bedford.

2069
02:21:48.24 --> 02:21:52.24
And when I saw him, I said, I'm going to marry him.

2070
02:21:52.24 --> 02:21:54.24
You made the call, huh?

2071
02:21:54.24 --> 02:21:55.24
I made the call.

2072
02:21:55.24 --> 02:22:01.24
Who else you already had a girlfriend because all the girls from Bedford, the town, the non-Jewish girls.

2073
02:22:01.24 --> 02:22:05.24
They would come to the hostel. They like the Jewish boys.

2074
02:22:05.24 --> 02:22:09.24
So you had to, uh, I had to wait. I took me to the middle of the room.

2075
02:22:09.24 --> 02:22:11.24
It took me some time, but I got him.

2076
02:22:11.24 --> 02:22:13.24
Test your patience.

2077
02:22:13.24 --> 02:22:15.24
Right. That's what you need to do in life.

2078
02:22:15.24 --> 02:22:16.24
Okay.

2079
02:22:16.24 --> 02:22:18.24
But you got to go after what you want.

2080
02:22:18.24 --> 02:22:19.24
Absolutely.

2081
02:22:19.24 --> 02:22:20.24
You got to take a little risk sometimes.

2082
02:22:20.24 --> 02:22:21.24
Yes.

2083
02:22:21.24 --> 02:22:22.24
Coming from Rose.

2084
02:22:22.24 --> 02:22:26.24
You, uh, you get jobs.

2085
02:22:26.24 --> 02:22:28.24
You learning, like, now you moved to London.

2086
02:22:28.24 --> 02:22:32.24
Who is it that moves to London? Is it you, Max and Fred that all moved to London together?

2087
02:22:32.24 --> 02:22:34.24
Yes, yes, we did.

2088
02:22:34.24 --> 02:22:38.24
And because the hostel was closing, the kids were leaving.

2089
02:22:38.24 --> 02:22:40.24
They were finding relatives in the United States.

2090
02:22:40.24 --> 02:22:43.24
They're going to Israel. They're going to Australia.

2091
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:45.24
You know, because we were all orphans.

2092
02:22:45.24 --> 02:22:49.24
And a lot of us remembered we had relatives here there and everywhere, okay?

2093
02:22:49.24 --> 02:22:52.24
So, uh, a lot of them.

2094
02:22:52.24 --> 02:22:59.24
So, a lot of us from England, you know, came to England and then we went over to the United States.

2095
02:22:59.24 --> 02:23:02.24
And...

2096
02:23:02.24 --> 02:23:07.24
You, uh, you guys get married. You say it at, at, when you guys get married,

2097
02:23:07.24 --> 02:23:11.24
your reception is 95% of the guests are survivors in the hall.

2098
02:23:11.24 --> 02:23:13.24
Yes, also survivors.

2099
02:23:13.24 --> 02:23:17.24
We kind of stuck together, you know what I mean?

2100
02:23:17.24 --> 02:23:18.24
Yeah.

2101
02:23:18.24 --> 02:23:20.24
We've had in hospitals together.

2102
02:23:20.24 --> 02:23:24.24
And then even when we came to London, we did not live in a hostel.

2103
02:23:24.24 --> 02:23:30.24
They, you know, they put us in private homes and the organization would pay for our upkeep.

2104
02:23:30.24 --> 02:23:34.24
You, uh, you go on a honeymoon.

2105
02:23:34.24 --> 02:23:36.24
Is it a honeymoon when you guys go to Paris?

2106
02:23:36.24 --> 02:23:37.24
Yes.

2107
02:23:37.24 --> 02:23:39.24
You say I never thought I could be this happy.

2108
02:23:39.24 --> 02:23:41.24
You get after all we lived through in the camps.

2109
02:23:41.24 --> 02:23:44.24
As we head back to England, I think of my parents and wonder if they were ever this happy.

2110
02:23:44.24 --> 02:23:47.24
Thinking of my parents makes me miss them for a moment and I'm sad.

2111
02:23:47.24 --> 02:23:50.24
But then we arrive at our destination and the thought,

2112
02:23:50.24 --> 02:23:55.24
sad thoughts are pushed aside in favor of your hope for the future.

2113
02:23:55.24 --> 02:24:00.24
So it's just such a common theme that you talk about all the time.

2114
02:24:00.24 --> 02:24:06.24
That you're not going to get caught up in the past.

2115
02:24:06.24 --> 02:24:09.24
And it's not that you're going to forget about the past,

2116
02:24:09.24 --> 02:24:11.24
but you're not going to dwell there.

2117
02:24:11.24 --> 02:24:12.24
Right.

2118
02:24:12.24 --> 02:24:17.24
But you cannot get, go, you cannot, life is still look forward for better things.

2119
02:24:17.24 --> 02:24:20.24
I mean, if you're going to look for the past all the time,

2120
02:24:20.24 --> 02:24:22.24
it's not going to get you anywhere.

2121
02:24:22.24 --> 02:24:23.24
Okay.

2122
02:24:23.24 --> 02:24:30.24
So we just have to hope for the best and do the best we can.

2123
02:24:30.24 --> 02:24:33.24
You say here, London is a fun city for us.

2124
02:24:33.24 --> 02:24:35.24
We have lots of friends and enjoy our jobs.

2125
02:24:35.24 --> 02:24:38.24
Five years of flown by since leaving the hostel.

2126
02:24:38.24 --> 02:24:40.24
And we are so happy for our new life here together.

2127
02:24:40.24 --> 02:24:44.24
And again, I'm fast forwarding through a bunch of really good stuff.

2128
02:24:44.24 --> 02:24:47.24
And then you say one night, over a wonderful dinner,

2129
02:24:47.24 --> 02:24:50.24
a fish and chips, Max proclaims, rows.

2130
02:24:50.24 --> 02:24:53.24
I think it's time for us to move to America.

2131
02:24:53.24 --> 02:24:56.24
His statement takes me by surprise.

2132
02:24:56.24 --> 02:24:59.24
Max periodically talked about moving to America since we met.

2133
02:24:59.24 --> 02:25:01.24
We talk about America as a destination for someday,

2134
02:25:01.24 --> 02:25:04.24
but I never considered that someday might be today.

2135
02:25:04.24 --> 02:25:07.24
He told me that his father had been trying to get the family

2136
02:25:07.24 --> 02:25:11.24
immigration visas before the Germans rounded up all the Jews.

2137
02:25:11.24 --> 02:25:12.24
Right.

2138
02:25:12.24 --> 02:25:14.24
I don't know Max what we do in America.

2139
02:25:14.24 --> 02:25:20.24
Whatever we want, he tells me with a smile.

2140
02:25:20.24 --> 02:25:22.24
So that was your vision of America.

2141
02:25:22.24 --> 02:25:23.24
Right.

2142
02:25:23.24 --> 02:25:24.24
Was it going to go there?

2143
02:25:24.24 --> 02:25:25.24
Yes.

2144
02:25:25.24 --> 02:25:29.24
And yes, that was our hope.

2145
02:25:29.24 --> 02:25:32.24
The young guy had he didn't offer to bring us,

2146
02:25:32.24 --> 02:25:35.24
but Max's family offered to bring us.

2147
02:25:35.24 --> 02:25:37.24
Send us effidavits.

2148
02:25:37.24 --> 02:25:40.24
What would the effidavits for?

2149
02:25:40.24 --> 02:25:42.24
To come to America?

2150
02:25:42.24 --> 02:25:44.24
So they just got assigned that, hey, we're going to...

2151
02:25:44.24 --> 02:25:46.24
The responsible for you.

2152
02:25:46.24 --> 02:25:49.24
They were responsible for us for five years.

2153
02:25:49.24 --> 02:25:51.24
Okay.

2154
02:25:51.24 --> 02:25:54.24
So, of course, when we came to America,

2155
02:25:54.24 --> 02:25:55.24
we spoke perfectly.

2156
02:25:55.24 --> 02:25:57.24
Surely, we've been 34 days.

2157
02:25:57.24 --> 02:25:58.24
We had jobs.

2158
02:25:58.24 --> 02:26:00.24
We've already grown up.

2159
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:02.24
Land of opportunity.

2160
02:26:02.24 --> 02:26:05.24
Land of opportunities here, right?

2161
02:26:05.24 --> 02:26:07.24
Uh.

2162
02:26:07.24 --> 02:26:10.24
Although, I thought, well, maybe you can expand on this a little bit,

2163
02:26:10.24 --> 02:26:12.24
because, well, first of all, October 3rd,

2164
02:26:12.24 --> 02:26:14.24
1951, Rose and I, this is Max, Max talking.

2165
02:26:14.24 --> 02:26:16.24
Rose and I, where both were our fathers,

2166
02:26:16.24 --> 02:26:19.24
watch chains as we leave the apartment.

2167
02:26:19.24 --> 02:26:21.24
When we reach New York City, October 12th,

2168
02:26:21.24 --> 02:26:23.24
my uncle and second cousin's meet us at the dock

2169
02:26:23.24 --> 02:26:25.24
and put us up in a Manhattan hotel for two nights.

2170
02:26:25.24 --> 02:26:28.24
Our hotel window looks out into a junkyard.

2171
02:26:28.24 --> 02:26:31.24
Which makes us want to check out as soon as possible.

2172
02:26:31.24 --> 02:26:34.24
After a quick breakfast on our second full day in America,

2173
02:26:34.24 --> 02:26:36.24
my uncle gives us $20, and says,

2174
02:26:36.24 --> 02:26:37.24
good luck you're on your own.

2175
02:26:37.24 --> 02:26:38.24
Right.

2176
02:26:38.24 --> 02:26:40.24
From then on, we will never stay in family again.

2177
02:26:40.24 --> 02:26:42.24
I do not feel we need them.

2178
02:26:42.24 --> 02:26:44.24
We can make it here in America on our own,

2179
02:26:44.24 --> 02:26:46.24
as long as Rose and I have each other.

2180
02:26:46.24 --> 02:26:50.24
I tell you, we've got very lucky to have these relatives.

2181
02:26:50.24 --> 02:26:52.24
Okay, Max's family.

2182
02:26:52.24 --> 02:26:56.24
They were really amazing people, okay?

2183
02:26:56.24 --> 02:26:59.24
And we love each other deeply.

2184
02:26:59.24 --> 02:27:00.24
Okay?

2185
02:27:00.24 --> 02:27:02.24
They welcomed us like their own kids.

2186
02:27:02.24 --> 02:27:05.24
But thank God, we never needed their help.

2187
02:27:05.24 --> 02:27:07.24
Yeah, that's all, so.

2188
02:27:07.24 --> 02:27:12.24
So he gets a job at a scale company,

2189
02:27:12.24 --> 02:27:15.24
working on making scales.

2190
02:27:15.24 --> 02:27:16.24
Right.

2191
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:20.24
And then he notices some little up-growing company

2192
02:27:20.24 --> 02:27:23.24
called International Business Machines,

2193
02:27:23.24 --> 02:27:24.24
or IBM.

2194
02:27:24.24 --> 02:27:25.24
Right, right.

2195
02:27:25.24 --> 02:27:27.24
He realizes maybe that could be a good job.

2196
02:27:27.24 --> 02:27:28.24
Right.

2197
02:27:28.24 --> 02:27:30.24
He gets involved in that.

2198
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:36.24
You end up passing out one time on the train.

2199
02:27:36.24 --> 02:27:38.24
You get to go to the doctor.

2200
02:27:38.24 --> 02:27:41.24
And then Max says,

2201
02:27:41.24 --> 02:27:42.24
when Rose calls me the next day,

2202
02:27:42.24 --> 02:27:44.24
she tells me there's nothing at all to worry about.

2203
02:27:44.24 --> 02:27:45.24
Excitedly, she says,

2204
02:27:45.24 --> 02:27:48.24
the doctor says that there's only one thing going on with me.

2205
02:27:48.24 --> 02:27:50.24
And that is that I am pregnant.

2206
02:27:50.24 --> 02:27:51.24
Right.

2207
02:27:51.24 --> 02:27:54.24
Uh,

2208
02:27:54.24 --> 02:27:57.24
1955.

2209
02:27:57.24 --> 02:27:59.24
Max decides he's going to come and check out

2210
02:27:59.24 --> 02:28:02.24
a little place called San Diego California.

2211
02:28:02.24 --> 02:28:03.24
Right.

2212
02:28:03.24 --> 02:28:05.24
We all know what happens when you come to San Diego for.

2213
02:28:05.24 --> 02:28:06.24
Nobody wants to leave.

2214
02:28:06.24 --> 02:28:07.24
Nobody wants to leave.

2215
02:28:07.24 --> 02:28:08.24
Max included.

2216
02:28:08.24 --> 02:28:12.24
And then you arrived in April of 1956.

2217
02:28:12.24 --> 02:28:14.24
You baby Roxanne.

2218
02:28:14.24 --> 02:28:17.24
And then you end up with a place in North Park.

2219
02:28:17.24 --> 02:28:18.24
Right.

2220
02:28:18.24 --> 02:28:20.24
You get a job at Golden State Fabrics.

2221
02:28:20.24 --> 02:28:21.24
Right.

2222
02:28:21.24 --> 02:28:22.24
Uh-huh.

2223
02:28:22.24 --> 02:28:25.24
And then you start raising your family.

2224
02:28:25.24 --> 02:28:26.24
Yeah.

2225
02:28:26.24 --> 02:28:28.24
Ben arrives in 1957,

2226
02:28:28.24 --> 02:28:29.24
who I met today.

2227
02:28:29.24 --> 02:28:30.24
Mm-hmm.

2228
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:31.24
Yeah.

2229
02:28:31.24 --> 02:28:32.24
It was a second.

2230
02:28:32.24 --> 02:28:35.24
I have a daughter who's 65 years old.

2231
02:28:35.24 --> 02:28:38.24
And Ben is 62.

2232
02:28:38.24 --> 02:28:42.24
So we came to San Diego in 1956.

2233
02:28:42.24 --> 02:28:45.24
I came to San, he, Max came Christmas time.

2234
02:28:45.24 --> 02:28:47.24
First, he came for the three-day visit.

2235
02:28:47.24 --> 02:28:48.24
Mm-hmm.

2236
02:28:48.24 --> 02:28:49.24
And he never went back to New York.

2237
02:28:49.24 --> 02:28:51.24
It caused me two days later, he's as Rose.

2238
02:28:51.24 --> 02:28:52.24
Mm-hmm.

2239
02:28:52.24 --> 02:28:53.24
Moving to San Diego.

2240
02:28:53.24 --> 02:28:55.24
He got a job at solar.

2241
02:28:55.24 --> 02:28:56.24
Okay.

2242
02:28:56.24 --> 02:28:57.24
Okay.

2243
02:28:57.24 --> 02:28:59.24
And worked for solar for five years.

2244
02:28:59.24 --> 02:29:04.24
And then, uh, he went to General Dynamics.

2245
02:29:04.24 --> 02:29:10.24
He retired after working at General Dynamics for 28 years.

2246
02:29:10.24 --> 02:29:12.24
Good.

2247
02:29:12.24 --> 02:29:16.24
Good, uh, good career in a great place to settle down.

2248
02:29:16.24 --> 02:29:17.24
All right.

2249
02:29:17.24 --> 02:29:19.24
So we lived in North Park for six months.

2250
02:29:19.24 --> 02:29:22.24
And then we bought a house in Allied Gardens.

2251
02:29:22.24 --> 02:29:26.24
You know, you know, I'm going to take a little aside here.

2252
02:29:26.24 --> 02:29:35.24
You say this, um, you say occasionally I still wonder if there is a God.

2253
02:29:35.24 --> 02:29:38.24
How could there be with all the terror that happened to us and to others?

2254
02:29:38.24 --> 02:29:40.24
Surely God would not have allowed it.

2255
02:29:40.24 --> 02:29:42.24
When I think about this, it makes me angry.

2256
02:29:42.24 --> 02:29:46.24
I asked myself, why God would have allowed the Holocaust to happen and never come up with an answer.

2257
02:29:46.24 --> 02:29:49.24
I cannot sort out with what I feel.

2258
02:29:49.24 --> 02:29:55.24
So this question has to be put aside to allow me to continue with all the good in my life.

2259
02:29:55.24 --> 02:30:00.24
That's a very big question.

2260
02:30:00.24 --> 02:30:05.24
Losing so many people.

2261
02:30:05.24 --> 02:30:10.24
Complete families wiped out.

2262
02:30:10.24 --> 02:30:14.24
There's so many complete families wiped out.

2263
02:30:14.24 --> 02:30:22.24
You know, the one woman that talked to you inside Auschwitz that said,

2264
02:30:22.24 --> 02:30:28.24
you will never make any sense of this because it doesn't make any sense.

2265
02:30:28.24 --> 02:30:32.24
Like this is too insane to understand.

2266
02:30:32.24 --> 02:30:33.24
Right.

2267
02:30:33.24 --> 02:30:36.24
You can't comprehend it because it's incomprehensible.

2268
02:30:36.24 --> 02:30:37.24
It is.

2269
02:30:37.24 --> 02:30:43.24
I mean, we're sitting here talking about, you know, you and your direct family.

2270
02:30:43.24 --> 02:30:48.24
And then you multiply it times two to get you and your direct family and Max and his direct family.

2271
02:30:48.24 --> 02:30:54.24
But then you have to do that hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times over and over again.

2272
02:30:54.24 --> 02:31:03.24
And every one of those unidentified bodies that got buried in a mass grave with no identification and no family.

2273
02:31:03.24 --> 02:31:04.24
And every one of those.

2274
02:31:04.24 --> 02:31:09.24
And you know, this is something I talk about a lot because it happens in war all the time.

2275
02:31:09.24 --> 02:31:12.24
Oh, there was there was a 22 soldiers killed.

2276
02:31:12.24 --> 02:31:19.24
Oh, there was, you know, 428 soldiers killed on this attack in World War I.

2277
02:31:19.24 --> 02:31:21.24
Those aren't just soldiers.

2278
02:31:21.24 --> 02:31:22.24
You know, those are people.

2279
02:31:22.24 --> 02:31:23.24
Guys not.

2280
02:31:23.24 --> 02:31:24.24
Absolutely.

2281
02:31:24.24 --> 02:31:30.24
And these people, these bodies unidentified bodies.

2282
02:31:30.24 --> 02:31:35.24
Every one of them, that a family had had hopes and had to be.

2283
02:31:35.24 --> 02:31:36.24
Absolutely.

2284
02:31:36.24 --> 02:31:37.24
Absolutely.

2285
02:31:37.24 --> 02:31:44.24
Yeah.

2286
02:31:44.24 --> 02:31:51.24
Max convinces sounds like he kind of convinces Fred to come out and move to California.

2287
02:31:51.24 --> 02:32:00.24
It sounds like Fred had a harder time after he did.

2288
02:32:00.24 --> 02:32:01.24
He did.

2289
02:32:01.24 --> 02:32:02.24
He had a harder time.

2290
02:32:02.24 --> 02:32:04.24
He lost his hair in the camp.

2291
02:32:04.24 --> 02:32:08.24
After liberation, his hair never came back.

2292
02:32:08.24 --> 02:32:10.24
And he was more.

2293
02:32:10.24 --> 02:32:17.24
A lot of people are more obsessed from the past.

2294
02:32:17.24 --> 02:32:23.24
The best thing is sometimes to forget some, you know, not to think always about the past.

2295
02:32:23.24 --> 02:32:27.24
Because you want to go ahead.

2296
02:32:27.24 --> 02:32:31.24
Yeah, I think that I talk people when I talk about loss, right?

2297
02:32:31.24 --> 02:32:38.24
Because I lost a lot of friends and when people ask me about how they handle that,

2298
02:32:38.24 --> 02:32:44.24
I tell them to remember, but don't dwell.

2299
02:32:44.24 --> 02:32:46.24
So we never want to forget what happened.

2300
02:32:46.24 --> 02:32:53.24
But we don't want to, as you're saying, we don't want to sit there in the past because we need to think about the future.

2301
02:32:53.24 --> 02:32:54.24
Right.

2302
02:32:54.24 --> 02:32:55.24
Absolutely.

2303
02:32:55.24 --> 02:32:56.24
Absolutely.

2304
02:32:56.24 --> 02:32:59.24
Max says we don't really talk about the camps much at all.

2305
02:32:59.24 --> 02:33:02.24
Our friends don't want to hear about the atrocities and we don't want to relive them.

2306
02:33:02.24 --> 02:33:05.24
Even in our survivors group, it's not a big subject.

2307
02:33:05.24 --> 02:33:09.24
It is difficult to talk about losing absolutely everything your home, your family, everything you own,

2308
02:33:09.24 --> 02:33:11.24
even your family photos.

2309
02:33:11.24 --> 02:33:16.24
For most Jewish families, the only people to survive are those who left your upper head.

2310
02:33:16.24 --> 02:33:18.24
Our circumstances are rare.

2311
02:33:18.24 --> 02:33:23.24
Even Rose and I have an unspoken agreement, not to speak of it between us.

2312
02:33:23.24 --> 02:33:26.24
We both understand and do not need to talk about it.

2313
02:33:26.24 --> 02:33:28.24
We are focused on going forward.

2314
02:33:28.24 --> 02:33:29.24
Right.

2315
02:33:29.24 --> 02:33:33.24
Looking ahead and working on everything together.

2316
02:33:33.24 --> 02:33:39.24
That's what life is all about.

2317
02:33:39.24 --> 02:33:46.24
When you talked about, again, just Max's career, and he's one of the things that he said about his career,

2318
02:33:46.24 --> 02:33:54.24
he said, I want my children to see that anything is possible with determination, hard work, and an eagerness to learn.

2319
02:33:54.24 --> 02:33:58.24
Right.

2320
02:33:58.24 --> 02:34:09.24
If Max, if the war wouldn't have been affecting Max so badly, or in his whole family, he would have been really something very special.

2321
02:34:09.24 --> 02:34:13.24
It was a very smart man.

2322
02:34:13.24 --> 02:34:17.24
So, I mean, we also have no education.

2323
02:34:17.24 --> 02:34:23.24
They were a lot of big plans for the Shindler boys before the war.

2324
02:34:23.24 --> 02:34:28.24
Of course, it all went to hell.

2325
02:34:28.24 --> 02:34:40.24
When you, your son Steve's 13 years old, and tell us about what happened there, that kind of changed the direction of your life a little bit.

2326
02:34:40.24 --> 02:34:45.24
Well, he was in the end-franx story, and he played the part of Peter.

2327
02:34:45.24 --> 02:34:52.24
The teacher found out that his parents are Holocaust survivors at Louis Junior High, and I like going to the end-franx story.

2328
02:34:52.24 --> 02:34:54.24
And I like guns.

2329
02:34:54.24 --> 02:34:57.24
And that's when I started speaking about the Holocaust.

2330
02:34:57.24 --> 02:35:01.24
Before we didn't want to talk about it.

2331
02:35:01.24 --> 02:35:05.24
Because life goes on.

2332
02:35:05.24 --> 02:35:10.24
And so we didn't want to even tell our kids a lot about what happened.

2333
02:35:10.24 --> 02:35:18.24
So when Steve was in this play, they started calling me to go out and talk about the Holocaust.

2334
02:35:18.24 --> 02:35:23.24
And I've been speaking there that it's close to 50 years now.

2335
02:35:23.24 --> 02:35:25.24
Steve is 62.

2336
02:35:25.24 --> 02:35:26.24
No, he's 60.

2337
02:35:26.24 --> 02:35:27.24
He's 60.

2338
02:35:27.24 --> 02:35:29.24
Ben is 62.

2339
02:35:29.24 --> 02:35:32.24
Steve is going to be 61 next month.

2340
02:35:32.24 --> 02:35:36.24
So you can imagine how many years I've been speaking about the Holocaust.

2341
02:35:36.24 --> 02:35:39.24
Well, one thing that you said in here that I think,

2342
02:35:39.24 --> 02:35:42.24
really is a bold statement.

2343
02:35:42.24 --> 02:35:47.24
You say the Germans did not succeed in their endeavour to silence the Jews or prevent anyone from telling.

2344
02:35:47.24 --> 02:35:49.24
Anyone from telling their of their atrocities.

2345
02:35:49.24 --> 02:35:52.24
I am one of the few who remain and I can tell the world.

2346
02:35:52.24 --> 02:35:53.24
Right.

2347
02:35:53.24 --> 02:35:55.24
A.T. 2. 5.

2348
02:35:55.24 --> 02:35:57.24
8. 9. 3.

2349
02:35:57.24 --> 02:35:59.24
On my forearm has a new value.

2350
02:35:59.24 --> 02:36:00.24
Right.

2351
02:36:00.24 --> 02:36:02.24
And I'm not wanting to pass up an opportunity.

2352
02:36:02.24 --> 02:36:06.24
This may be my first time speaking, but I will find more places to share.

2353
02:36:06.24 --> 02:36:07.24
My story.

2354
02:36:07.24 --> 02:36:12.24
That's what you said after you got done speaking to those kids for the first time.

2355
02:36:12.24 --> 02:36:23.24
You were talking to Max after you did the after you talked to the kids.

2356
02:36:23.24 --> 02:36:26.24
The first time you guys are having this conversation.

2357
02:36:26.24 --> 02:36:29.24
And this is Max talking. He says,

2358
02:36:29.24 --> 02:36:34.24
He's asking you, you know, what, what, what, what were they asking you about?

2359
02:36:34.24 --> 02:36:35.24
He says, what else did they ask?

2360
02:36:35.24 --> 02:36:38.24
And it says, Rose thought for a moment before responding.

2361
02:36:38.24 --> 02:36:41.24
One tile to ask, why do I think I survived Auschwitz?

2362
02:36:41.24 --> 02:36:43.24
She says, awfully.

2363
02:36:43.24 --> 02:36:46.24
The fact that a child asks this is interesting to me.

2364
02:36:46.24 --> 02:36:48.24
Sometimes children say things that adults won't.

2365
02:36:48.24 --> 02:36:50.24
I know that Rose has thought about this before.

2366
02:36:50.24 --> 02:36:52.24
So I'm interested to hear her answer.

2367
02:36:52.24 --> 02:36:54.24
I push a little further.

2368
02:36:54.24 --> 02:36:55.24
And what was your answer?

2369
02:36:55.24 --> 02:36:57.24
I ask quietly.

2370
02:36:57.24 --> 02:37:00.24
It's a miracle that I survived Auschwitz.

2371
02:37:00.24 --> 02:37:07.24
Also, I really do think part of it is because I kept looking out and trying new things.

2372
02:37:07.24 --> 02:37:09.24
I would not give up.

2373
02:37:09.24 --> 02:37:14.24
I just continued and never gave up hope.

2374
02:37:14.24 --> 02:37:19.24
As I process her words, she squeezes my hands across the table and says,

2375
02:37:19.24 --> 02:37:23.24
You did the exact same thing.

2376
02:37:23.24 --> 02:37:25.24
This takes me a back for a moment.

2377
02:37:25.24 --> 02:37:26.24
It is true.

2378
02:37:26.24 --> 02:37:30.24
But I've never thought about my time in the camps in this way before.

2379
02:37:30.24 --> 02:37:36.24
It really is true that you don't know when the next attempt that survival might be the one that's

2380
02:37:36.24 --> 02:37:39.24
exceed, I say.

2381
02:37:39.24 --> 02:37:41.24
I smile and squeeze her hand back.

2382
02:37:41.24 --> 02:37:44.24
You really are amazing Rose.

2383
02:37:44.24 --> 02:37:46.24
We got to this place together, Max.

2384
02:37:46.24 --> 02:37:50.24
Rose replies before placing a kiss on my cheek.

2385
02:37:50.24 --> 02:37:56.24
We sit silently for a moment as we both ponder how our lives could have been different.

2386
02:37:56.24 --> 02:38:01.24
Before this moment is broken, I squeeze her hand to get her attention.

2387
02:38:01.24 --> 02:38:03.24
We have climbed mountains.

2388
02:38:03.24 --> 02:38:05.24
I did not know we could climb.

2389
02:38:05.24 --> 02:38:07.24
We made it Rose.

2390
02:38:07.24 --> 02:38:09.24
We made it.

2391
02:38:09.24 --> 02:38:12.24
Yep.

2392
02:38:12.24 --> 02:38:24.24
And actually, as we came in, I'm sorry Rose.

2393
02:38:24.24 --> 02:38:31.24
We've gone over three years now, but it's 67 years.

2394
02:38:31.24 --> 02:38:43.24
Well, I think the incredible life that you shared together is something that is a beautiful story.

2395
02:38:43.24 --> 02:38:52.24
Ben, when he came in, he said he'd been listening to the podcast a little bit to kind of get a feel for it and talk to you a little bit about what it's going to be like.

2396
02:38:52.24 --> 02:38:55.24
He's just in one of the podcasts.

2397
02:38:55.24 --> 02:39:01.24
And one of the podcasts, what I was saying in the podcast was keep moving forward.

2398
02:39:01.24 --> 02:39:04.24
Like, hey, things are going to be hard. You keep moving forward.

2399
02:39:04.24 --> 02:39:10.24
And he actually brought in a photograph of Max's tombstone.

2400
02:39:10.24 --> 02:39:24.24
And it has the single quote that Max, that the family decided to put on the grave stone was live day to day and keep moving forward.

2401
02:39:24.24 --> 02:39:35.24
And I got to say, like I said, this whole thing got started when my wife went and saw you speak.

2402
02:39:35.24 --> 02:39:44.24
And just looking at this book, you didn't know her at the time, but you made a little inscription to my wife.

2403
02:39:44.24 --> 02:39:51.24
And it just says, Helen, never give up hope.

2404
02:39:51.24 --> 02:39:56.24
Signed rose, Schindler.

2405
02:39:56.24 --> 02:39:59.24
And I think that I did I write that down.

2406
02:39:59.24 --> 02:40:00.24
I wrote that right there.

2407
02:40:00.24 --> 02:40:03.24
No kidding. Never give up hope.

2408
02:40:03.24 --> 02:40:05.24
Never give up hope.

2409
02:40:05.24 --> 02:40:14.24
So, I mean, I think that really between never give up hope and keep moving forward.

2410
02:40:14.24 --> 02:40:17.24
Those are very strong.

2411
02:40:17.24 --> 02:40:25.24
String, saying, and you and Max are shining examples of how to actually do that.

2412
02:40:25.24 --> 02:40:26.24
Right.

2413
02:40:26.24 --> 02:40:29.24
How to actually do that in life.

2414
02:40:29.24 --> 02:40:32.24
I know I've had you trapped in here for a while.

2415
02:40:32.24 --> 02:40:37.24
You have a website.

2416
02:40:37.24 --> 02:40:40.24
The name of the book is to who survived.

2417
02:40:40.24 --> 02:40:41.24
To who survived.com.

2418
02:40:41.24 --> 02:40:44.24
Yes, so there's a website called to who survived.com.

2419
02:40:44.24 --> 02:40:47.24
The book is available there. The book is available on Amazon.

2420
02:40:47.24 --> 02:40:53.24
We'll have a link to it so people can get it through our website to make it easy for them.

2421
02:40:53.24 --> 02:40:57.24
Because they know our podcast website is Jockel Podcast.

2422
02:40:57.24 --> 02:41:00.24
You also have social media.

2423
02:41:00.24 --> 02:41:04.24
So despite the fact that you're not quite a teenager anymore.

2424
02:41:04.24 --> 02:41:08.24
You still have Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.

2425
02:41:08.24 --> 02:41:13.24
All those are at two who survived.

2426
02:41:13.24 --> 02:41:17.24
It's written out TWO who survived.

2427
02:41:17.24 --> 02:41:19.24
Right.

2428
02:41:19.24 --> 02:41:26.24
And the book, I'm telling you, I read a little, I read a fraction of the book today.

2429
02:41:26.24 --> 02:41:28.24
There's so many details in there.

2430
02:41:28.24 --> 02:41:32.24
The stories, the two intertwining stories are so moving.

2431
02:41:32.24 --> 02:41:34.24
They're so powerful.

2432
02:41:34.24 --> 02:41:37.24
And it's like I said, it reads like a story.

2433
02:41:37.24 --> 02:41:39.24
It's a real story.

2434
02:41:39.24 --> 02:41:41.24
Exactly what happened.

2435
02:41:41.24 --> 02:41:45.24
And the language is just, it feels like you're sitting across the table hearing it first.

2436
02:41:45.24 --> 02:41:49.24
The language is actually, we did this for middle school.

2437
02:41:49.24 --> 02:41:51.24
Well, it was perfect for me then.

2438
02:41:51.24 --> 02:41:53.24
It's perfect for everybody, I guess.

2439
02:41:53.24 --> 02:41:59.24
But we thought it's so important for us to tell it to the kids at school.

2440
02:41:59.24 --> 02:42:01.24
What happened to us?

2441
02:42:01.24 --> 02:42:08.24
Yeah, it's a beautiful book, I mean, despite the fact that it's filled with horror,

2442
02:42:08.24 --> 02:42:15.24
it still is a beautiful book about about the strength of that human beings can display,

2443
02:42:15.24 --> 02:42:20.24
even in the face of the evil of other human beings.

2444
02:42:20.24 --> 02:42:21.24
Yeah.

2445
02:42:21.24 --> 02:42:24.24
Do you have any closing thoughts, Rose?

2446
02:42:24.24 --> 02:42:26.24
I don't want to keep you in here.

2447
02:42:26.24 --> 02:42:28.24
I want to thank you for doing that.

2448
02:42:28.24 --> 02:42:33.24
I hope people will enjoy your story.

2449
02:42:33.24 --> 02:42:35.24
Okay?

2450
02:42:35.24 --> 02:42:40.24
I don't even know where it, if I turn on my,

2451
02:42:40.24 --> 02:42:42.24
I'd say it's not a radio.

2452
02:42:42.24 --> 02:42:44.24
I don't even know what you call it.

2453
02:42:44.24 --> 02:42:47.24
I'll explain to you how to get it done.

2454
02:42:47.24 --> 02:42:53.24
Well, we have, since Max passed away, I don't even use my,

2455
02:42:53.24 --> 02:42:58.24
I don't know where it is.

2456
02:42:58.24 --> 02:43:01.24
Right? Not a radio, it's a whole set.

2457
02:43:01.24 --> 02:43:04.24
I'll make sure to talk to Ben so that you can listen to it and watch it.

2458
02:43:04.24 --> 02:43:07.24
Actually, you can watch it too, because it'll be on,

2459
02:43:07.24 --> 02:43:12.24
it'll be on something called YouTube, which is like a television that you can watch.

2460
02:43:12.24 --> 02:43:13.24
But you can't put it on.

2461
02:43:13.24 --> 02:43:14.24
I'm on YouTube already.

2462
02:43:14.24 --> 02:43:17.24
Yeah, well, I've watched some of your stuff on YouTube.

2463
02:43:17.24 --> 02:43:19.24
You'll be on there more.

2464
02:43:19.24 --> 02:43:23.24
But it's really funny because I've never even put on my, it's not a radio that I have.

2465
02:43:23.24 --> 02:43:24.24
It's a whole set.

2466
02:43:24.24 --> 02:43:25.24
You know, like a stereo system.

2467
02:43:25.24 --> 02:43:26.24
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2468
02:43:26.24 --> 02:43:28.24
Right, the stereo system.

2469
02:43:28.24 --> 02:43:29.24
Okay.

2470
02:43:29.24 --> 02:43:31.24
I couldn't think of the right word.

2471
02:43:31.24 --> 02:43:33.24
The stereo system.

2472
02:43:33.24 --> 02:43:34.24
I should put it on some time.

2473
02:43:34.24 --> 02:43:37.24
Max used it all the time.

2474
02:43:37.24 --> 02:43:41.24
But ever since he passed away, things are so different from me.

2475
02:43:41.24 --> 02:43:43.24
Well, yeah, you know what?

2476
02:43:43.24 --> 02:43:45.24
I do recommend you go and put the stereo system on.

2477
02:43:45.24 --> 02:43:46.24
Put some records on there.

2478
02:43:46.24 --> 02:43:48.24
Yeah, you should see all the records we have.

2479
02:43:48.24 --> 02:43:53.24
Well, I bet that Max would like to sit down with you there and listen to some of those.

2480
02:43:53.24 --> 02:43:56.24
Listen to some of those albums.

2481
02:43:56.24 --> 02:43:57.24
I hope he can.

2482
02:43:57.24 --> 02:43:59.24
So I recommend you do it.

2483
02:43:59.24 --> 02:44:00.24
Okay.

2484
02:44:00.24 --> 02:44:01.24
Thank you very much.

2485
02:44:01.24 --> 02:44:03.24
Have a beautiful day and thank you.

2486
02:44:03.24 --> 02:44:05.24
And you too, and have a beautiful life.

2487
02:44:05.24 --> 02:44:11.24
And just remember, if you have a problem, if something is going, not going so well,

2488
02:44:11.24 --> 02:44:14.24
remember tomorrow is going to be better.

2489
02:44:14.24 --> 02:44:15.24
Okay.

2490
02:44:15.24 --> 02:44:16.24
I will do that.

2491
02:44:16.24 --> 02:44:17.24
Thank you so much for coming.

2492
02:44:17.24 --> 02:44:19.24
Thanks for sharing your story.

2493
02:44:19.24 --> 02:44:22.24
And thank you for giving us an example.

2494
02:44:22.24 --> 02:44:24.24
Thank you for doing this.

2495
02:44:24.24 --> 02:44:26.24
It's an honor to have you.

2496
02:44:26.24 --> 02:44:27.24
Thank you.

2497
02:44:27.24 --> 02:44:31.24
And with that rose,

2498
02:44:31.24 --> 02:44:34.24
Shindler has left the building.

2499
02:44:34.24 --> 02:44:38.24
What an honor to have her on.

2500
02:44:38.24 --> 02:44:41.24
What a story.

2501
02:44:41.24 --> 02:44:43.24
Pretty unbelievable.

2502
02:44:43.24 --> 02:44:45.24
Echo you made it through.

2503
02:44:45.24 --> 02:44:46.24
Yes.

2504
02:44:46.24 --> 02:44:52.24
It's kind of, it's kind of harrowing where you think about it from the perspective of a nine,

2505
02:44:52.24 --> 02:44:54.24
ten, eleven, twelve year old kid.

2506
02:44:54.24 --> 02:44:55.24
Yes.

2507
02:44:55.24 --> 02:44:56.24
Right.

2508
02:44:56.24 --> 02:44:56.24
Yeah.

2509
02:44:56.24 --> 02:45:01.24
And there's, so there's two things that I, well, there's a bunch of things that I pulled from it.

2510
02:45:01.24 --> 02:45:08.24
But two things that really stand out, small, seemingly small, but kind of big, where, like,

2511
02:45:08.24 --> 02:45:12.24
so they stuck together, you know.

2512
02:45:12.24 --> 02:45:17.24
And so what that was essentially was covering move.

2513
02:45:17.24 --> 02:45:18.24
Yeah.

2514
02:45:18.24 --> 02:45:19.24
The whole time.

2515
02:45:19.24 --> 02:45:20.24
Absolutely.

2516
02:45:20.24 --> 02:45:21.24
Because it was, yeah.

2517
02:45:21.24 --> 02:45:24.24
So that was kind of like, and you know how you said it was kind of counter counter,

2518
02:45:24.24 --> 02:45:25.24
counterintuitive.

2519
02:45:25.24 --> 02:45:26.24
Yeah.

2520
02:45:26.24 --> 02:45:27.24
Where it's like, oh, yeah.

2521
02:45:27.24 --> 02:45:29.24
Like, hey, if I don't have to depend on this person, whatever.

2522
02:45:29.24 --> 02:45:31.24
I identified the root of that thought in my brain.

2523
02:45:31.24 --> 02:45:32.24
Yeah.

2524
02:45:32.24 --> 02:45:34.24
Uh, I, when I was in Sri Lanka.

2525
02:45:34.24 --> 02:45:35.24
Mm-hmm.

2526
02:45:35.24 --> 02:45:39.24
And I worked closely with their special operations forces over there.

2527
02:45:39.24 --> 02:45:45.24
There was an army guy who was saying, when he was a, he was a normally infantry commander.

2528
02:45:45.24 --> 02:45:48.24
And there's a brutal civil war going on in Sri Lanka.

2529
02:45:48.24 --> 02:45:52.24
And he was telling me how hard it was to be in charge.

2530
02:45:52.24 --> 02:45:59.24
And he said, listen, if I was alone on the battlefield, he goes, I will 100% live and do the right thing.

2531
02:45:59.24 --> 02:46:00.24
100%.

2532
02:46:00.24 --> 02:46:01.24
Yeah.

2533
02:46:01.24 --> 02:46:06.24
He says, when I got all these other guys relying on me and making, you know, a, a responsible for them.

2534
02:46:06.24 --> 02:46:10.24
He says, it's so much, so much harder.

2535
02:46:10.24 --> 02:46:12.24
And that's what I was thinking.

2536
02:46:12.24 --> 02:46:16.24
So I was thinking that, hey, if you're just, if you're just going to take yourself, it's going to be easier.

2537
02:46:16.24 --> 02:46:20.24
But then I thought the same thing you thought, which was a way to second.

2538
02:46:20.24 --> 02:46:22.24
And that's exactly what I said to her.

2539
02:46:22.24 --> 02:46:25.24
You know, you're taking care of each other, you're covering moving forward each other.

2540
02:46:25.24 --> 02:46:26.24
Yeah.

2541
02:46:26.24 --> 02:46:33.24
Because that day where you're hurting, that day where you could use an extra quarter slice of bread.

2542
02:46:33.24 --> 02:46:37.24
You know, maybe you're someone your sister's can give it to you and no one else in the world would.

2543
02:46:37.24 --> 02:46:38.24
Yeah.

2544
02:46:38.24 --> 02:46:43.24
So yeah, the idea of sticking together and having that, and, you know, obviously, like that's what

2545
02:46:43.24 --> 02:46:47.24
That's what the seal ptune is, you know, that's what any, any team is, right?

2546
02:46:47.24 --> 02:46:52.24
Your, your, your sum is greater, the sum is greater than the parts.

2547
02:46:52.24 --> 02:46:53.24
Yeah.

2548
02:46:53.24 --> 02:46:55.24
That's what this is another proof of.

2549
02:46:55.24 --> 02:46:56.24
Yeah.

2550
02:46:56.24 --> 02:46:58.24
So it was one thing, what was the other thing?

2551
02:46:58.24 --> 02:47:03.24
Uh, just like, there's no real formula to survive. There's like a lot of luck, you know,

2552
02:47:03.24 --> 02:47:09.24
But man, her bravery basically was the function or was the result of just milking that luck.

2553
02:47:09.24 --> 02:47:12.24
Because she was basically sent to die plenty times.

2554
02:47:12.24 --> 02:47:13.24
Yeah.

2555
02:47:13.24 --> 02:47:16.24
But she would like sneak out of line and do all this stuff or whatever.

2556
02:47:16.24 --> 02:47:21.24
And that's like the kind, like you just get one person to see, like hey, or even realize,

2557
02:47:21.24 --> 02:47:24.24
You know, the kind where you go, you know, she goes for selection.

2558
02:47:24.24 --> 02:47:25.24
They're like, no, you're too skinny.

2559
02:47:25.24 --> 02:47:26.24
You're a muscle man.

2560
02:47:26.24 --> 02:47:28.24
You're a muscle man.

2561
02:47:28.24 --> 02:47:29.24
Sorry, muscle man is there.

2562
02:47:29.24 --> 02:47:30.24
What it is?

2563
02:47:30.24 --> 02:47:32.24
It's funny because it sounds like muscle man.

2564
02:47:32.24 --> 02:47:33.24
Yeah.

2565
02:47:33.24 --> 02:47:34.24
See exactly opposite.

2566
02:47:34.24 --> 02:47:39.24
And unless takes one guard to be like, hey, wait, didn't I just send you to go die?

2567
02:47:39.24 --> 02:47:40.24
Yes, they kind of thing.

2568
02:47:40.24 --> 02:47:42.24
And then we're still doing here.

2569
02:47:42.24 --> 02:47:43.24
Yeah.

2570
02:47:43.24 --> 02:47:44.24
Walk with me.

2571
02:47:44.24 --> 02:47:47.24
Yeah, I'm going to make sure this time kind of thing, you know,

2572
02:47:47.24 --> 02:47:48.24
Yeah.

2573
02:47:48.24 --> 02:47:51.24
The amount of, I was thinking about that too, you know, how we have, well,

2574
02:47:51.24 --> 02:47:53.24
It's literally called survivor bias, right?

2575
02:47:53.24 --> 02:47:54.24
Yeah.

2576
02:47:54.24 --> 02:47:57.24
And you know, you know, you're a victim of the fear from the people that made it.

2577
02:47:57.24 --> 02:48:02.24
And it seems like that's what you should do because how many thousands of people

2578
02:48:02.24 --> 02:48:05.24
said, oh, I'm going to sneak out of the sign and they got seen and they got,

2579
02:48:05.24 --> 02:48:06.24
Do they got killed?

2580
02:48:06.24 --> 02:48:08.24
You know, that happened over and over and over again.

2581
02:48:08.24 --> 02:48:09.24
Yeah.

2582
02:48:09.24 --> 02:48:12.24
And it's, I mean, you know, according to her, like you just do one single,

2583
02:48:12.24 --> 02:48:16.24
You know, sign of resistance, you're like, oh, well, they're just killing you.

2584
02:48:16.24 --> 02:48:20.24
Because like, and it makes sense because it's like not even, we need people to work

2585
02:48:20.24 --> 02:48:21.24
in obey.

2586
02:48:21.24 --> 02:48:22.24
That's it.

2587
02:48:22.24 --> 02:48:27.24
Well, if you don't want to do those two things, then we're just going to kill you.

2588
02:48:27.24 --> 02:48:29.24
And with no second thoughts whatsoever.

2589
02:48:29.24 --> 02:48:30.24
Yeah.

2590
02:48:30.24 --> 02:48:31.24
Yeah.

2591
02:48:31.24 --> 02:48:32.24
Yeah.

2592
02:48:32.24 --> 02:48:33.24
That's good.

2593
02:48:33.24 --> 02:48:34.24
Yeah.

2594
02:48:34.24 --> 02:48:37.24
I know it's, um, it is.

2595
02:48:37.24 --> 02:48:47.24
And isn't it crazy what a human being can get through, you know, can survive?

2596
02:48:47.24 --> 02:48:57.24
And it makes you realize that we have, like, just we are overwhelmed with opportunity.

2597
02:48:57.24 --> 02:48:57.24
Yeah.

2598
02:48:57.24 --> 02:49:02.24
Even if you consider that opportunity, it's just like going to go home and drink some water,

2599
02:49:02.24 --> 02:49:05.24
some clean water, going to go home and clean yourself.

2600
02:49:05.24 --> 02:49:05.24
Yeah.

2601
02:49:05.24 --> 02:49:10.24
Going to go home and not have bed bugs and lice.

2602
02:49:10.24 --> 02:49:11.24
Yeah.

2603
02:49:11.24 --> 02:49:12.24
That's, that's the plan.

2604
02:49:12.24 --> 02:49:14.24
That's what I'm going to do today.

2605
02:49:14.24 --> 02:49:18.24
I go home.

2606
02:49:18.24 --> 02:49:22.24
I'm not going to have bed bugs and lice.

2607
02:49:22.24 --> 02:49:22.24
Yeah.

2608
02:49:22.24 --> 02:49:23.24
Right.

2609
02:49:23.24 --> 02:49:24.24
We have food.

2610
02:49:24.24 --> 02:49:26.24
Leftovers, probably.

2611
02:49:26.24 --> 02:49:28.24
Hey, let's, let's do it.

2612
02:49:28.24 --> 02:49:29.24
You know, there's parts in the book.

2613
02:49:29.24 --> 02:49:35.24
I think there's parts in there where she's, she figures out where they basically clean the dirty,

2614
02:49:35.24 --> 02:49:40.24
uh, kitchenware from where they make the soup.

2615
02:49:40.24 --> 02:49:41.24
Yeah.

2616
02:49:41.24 --> 02:49:42.24
And every once in a while.

2617
02:49:42.24 --> 02:49:45.24
She can find potato peels, right?

2618
02:49:45.24 --> 02:49:49.24
And she has to keep it a secret.

2619
02:49:49.24 --> 02:49:50.24
Hmm.

2620
02:49:50.24 --> 02:49:55.24
Because, you know, she just shares the potato peels with her sisters only.

2621
02:49:55.24 --> 02:49:56.24
Yeah.

2622
02:49:56.24 --> 02:49:59.24
And if anyone else figures out that there's potato peels out there, there won't be any.

2623
02:49:59.24 --> 02:50:01.24
Like everyone will be there.

2624
02:50:01.24 --> 02:50:02.24
Yeah.

2625
02:50:02.24 --> 02:50:07.24
So, so, yeah, that's the kind of thing where you think, well, you're just because you have sisters,

2626
02:50:07.24 --> 02:50:08.24
it's helpful.

2627
02:50:08.24 --> 02:50:10.24
Because what did the sisters do that help her?

2628
02:50:10.24 --> 02:50:13.24
Yeah.

2629
02:50:13.24 --> 02:50:14.24
Yeah.

2630
02:50:14.24 --> 02:50:21.24
Even there's the time when I know you're probably feeling this too, where, where she, or might have been

2631
02:50:21.24 --> 02:50:28.24
Max, I forget which story it was, but they went from the, oh, yeah, once you went to work.

2632
02:50:28.24 --> 02:50:29.24
Hmm.

2633
02:50:29.24 --> 02:50:30.24
Right.

2634
02:50:30.24 --> 02:50:31.24
Before when they were just in harsh conditions.

2635
02:50:31.24 --> 02:50:35.24
And then they went to work and then they could like, take a shower once a week or something.

2636
02:50:35.24 --> 02:50:36.24
Yeah, once a week.

2637
02:50:36.24 --> 02:50:37.24
Yeah.

2638
02:50:37.24 --> 02:50:38.24
With soap.

2639
02:50:38.24 --> 02:50:39.24
Yeah.

2640
02:50:39.24 --> 02:50:43.24
And when, you know, when you're going down the list of all the new things that they had or whatever,

2641
02:50:43.24 --> 02:50:46.24
when you think about it comparatively, you know, to what we have or whatever, still like,

2642
02:50:46.24 --> 02:50:49.24
Pro those are like slave conditions really still.

2643
02:50:49.24 --> 02:50:50.24
Oh, for sure.

2644
02:50:50.24 --> 02:50:54.24
But since you were kind of engrossed in the story when you started revealing it, I was like,

2645
02:50:54.24 --> 02:50:57.24
Oh, that feels like a relief, even to me, you know, hearing it.

2646
02:50:57.24 --> 02:51:03.24
But man, that's, that's how that's like that demonstrates, you know, like, how thankful we should be.

2647
02:51:03.24 --> 02:51:04.24
Yeah.

2648
02:51:04.24 --> 02:51:05.24
Yeah.

2649
02:51:05.24 --> 02:51:06.24
Opportunities everywhere.

2650
02:51:06.24 --> 02:51:08.24
Opportunities.

2651
02:51:08.24 --> 02:51:11.24
And one opportunity you have is to live.

2652
02:51:11.24 --> 02:51:12.24
Yeah.

2653
02:51:12.24 --> 02:51:13.24
Yeah.

2654
02:51:13.24 --> 02:51:16.24
Live.

2655
02:51:16.24 --> 02:51:19.24
You're not sitting here worried about dying.

2656
02:51:19.24 --> 02:51:20.24
No.

2657
02:51:20.24 --> 02:51:23.24
You're not worried about getting, hey, go and that line over there.

2658
02:51:23.24 --> 02:51:25.24
By the way, it'll be dead in three minutes.

2659
02:51:25.24 --> 02:51:26.24
That's what's about to happen.

2660
02:51:26.24 --> 02:51:27.24
Yeah.

2661
02:51:27.24 --> 02:51:28.24
Do that nine times.

2662
02:51:28.24 --> 02:51:31.24
So.

2663
02:51:31.24 --> 02:51:35.24
Well, let's take advantage of the fact that we're alive.

2664
02:51:35.24 --> 02:51:39.24
It seems like a good plan.

2665
02:51:39.24 --> 02:51:40.24
Mm-hmm.

2666
02:51:40.24 --> 02:51:44.24
And what's do right?

2667
02:51:44.24 --> 02:51:46.24
What can we do?

2668
02:51:46.24 --> 02:51:50.24
What can we do to take advantage of the fact that we're alive right now?

2669
02:51:50.24 --> 02:51:51.24
I'll tell you.

2670
02:51:51.24 --> 02:51:54.24
We be and remain capable.

2671
02:51:54.24 --> 02:51:56.24
That's a big deal, too.

2672
02:51:56.24 --> 02:51:57.24
Mm-hmm.

2673
02:51:57.24 --> 02:52:00.24
Capability and health.

2674
02:52:00.24 --> 02:52:05.24
Crata tubes a big one.

2675
02:52:05.24 --> 02:52:07.24
Part of that health part of it is Jiu-Jitsu.

2676
02:52:07.24 --> 02:52:13.24
Obviously and capability Jiu-Jitsu allows for greater capability, exponentially greater.

2677
02:52:13.24 --> 02:52:14.24
My opinion.

2678
02:52:14.24 --> 02:52:16.24
I would agree.

2679
02:52:16.24 --> 02:52:17.24
In all aspects.

2680
02:52:17.24 --> 02:52:18.24
Yes.

2681
02:52:18.24 --> 02:52:20.24
So anyway, a lot of us are doing Jiu-Jitsu.

2682
02:52:20.24 --> 02:52:22.24
A lot of us are about to do Jiu-Jitsu.

2683
02:52:22.24 --> 02:52:24.24
We're going to need a key.

2684
02:52:24.24 --> 02:52:25.24
What key do we get?

2685
02:52:25.24 --> 02:52:26.24
Origin key.

2686
02:52:26.24 --> 02:52:27.24
Okay.

2687
02:52:27.24 --> 02:52:29.24
Also, if you do no key.

2688
02:52:29.24 --> 02:52:32.24
Get an origin, rash card.

2689
02:52:32.24 --> 02:52:38.24
The other part of the uniform in the totale, terian, ghee, and no ghee scenario.

2690
02:52:38.24 --> 02:52:41.24
That's not really totale terian, but it's-

2691
02:52:41.24 --> 02:52:42.24
Yeah, I just learned that.

2692
02:52:42.24 --> 02:52:44.24
Totaleity is what you meant.

2693
02:52:44.24 --> 02:52:47.24
Totale terian would mean there's a regime.

2694
02:52:47.24 --> 02:52:48.24
Yeah.

2695
02:52:48.24 --> 02:52:50.24
That's not what I mean at all.

2696
02:52:50.24 --> 02:52:53.24
Like I said, I just learned that word, so you know, I'm practicing.

2697
02:52:53.24 --> 02:52:55.24
And we'll get it right next time for sure.

2698
02:52:55.24 --> 02:52:56.24
Anyway, Origin main.com.

2699
02:52:56.24 --> 02:52:57.24
That's where you can get this stuff.

2700
02:52:57.24 --> 02:53:00.24
We also have jeans.

2701
02:53:00.24 --> 02:53:01.24
Yep.

2702
02:53:01.24 --> 02:53:05.24
In the event of you not doing Jiu-Jitsu at any point of the day.

2703
02:53:05.24 --> 02:53:07.24
Where's some origin?

2704
02:53:07.24 --> 02:53:08.24
Which is unfortunate.

2705
02:53:08.24 --> 02:53:11.24
You know, yeah, you know, but we got to be thankful.

2706
02:53:11.24 --> 02:53:12.24
You know?

2707
02:53:12.24 --> 02:53:14.24
Yeah, you get the-

2708
02:53:14.24 --> 02:53:17.24
By the way, I did a bad thing,

2709
02:53:17.24 --> 02:53:22.24
which was talk about the Delta 68 jeans before they were really, you know,

2710
02:53:22.24 --> 02:53:24.24
ready to be released.

2711
02:53:24.24 --> 02:53:26.24
Maybe I got overexcited.

2712
02:53:26.24 --> 02:53:27.24
Right.

2713
02:53:27.24 --> 02:53:29.24
Maybe I just lost my mind a little bit.

2714
02:53:29.24 --> 02:53:31.24
But I will say this.

2715
02:53:31.24 --> 02:53:36.24
I have seen the Delta 68 jeans, which are the most comfortable,

2716
02:53:36.24 --> 02:53:41.24
leg garments ever created by man of any kind.

2717
02:53:41.24 --> 02:53:42.24
Okay.

2718
02:53:42.24 --> 02:53:44.24
Our in-production right now.

2719
02:53:44.24 --> 02:53:45.24
Okay.

2720
02:53:45.24 --> 02:53:47.24
I think I've said that before, and I was inaccurate.

2721
02:53:47.24 --> 02:53:51.24
The last time I said their in-production, it sounded cool, but it was a little bit of like,

2722
02:53:51.24 --> 02:53:53.24
like, I was assuming.

2723
02:53:53.24 --> 02:53:55.24
I made an assumption which we know is not good.

2724
02:53:55.24 --> 02:53:57.24
The assumption was, oh yeah, they must be in production by now.

2725
02:53:57.24 --> 02:53:58.24
They weren't.

2726
02:53:58.24 --> 02:53:59.24
We were moving to fact.

2727
02:53:59.24 --> 02:54:02.24
We were moving the boot line into the new factory, Bob-Bob-Bob.

2728
02:54:02.24 --> 02:54:04.24
A bunch of things we're going on.

2729
02:54:04.24 --> 02:54:05.24
We weren't in production yet.

2730
02:54:05.24 --> 02:54:06.24
Guess what we are now.

2731
02:54:06.24 --> 02:54:07.24
We are in production.

2732
02:54:07.24 --> 02:54:08.24
Okay.

2733
02:54:08.24 --> 02:54:11.24
We are in production with Delta 68 jeans.

2734
02:54:11.24 --> 02:54:12.24
I understand.

2735
02:54:12.24 --> 02:54:17.24
And you claim that they're the most comfortable leg garment.

2736
02:54:17.24 --> 02:54:19.24
They not claim.

2737
02:54:19.24 --> 02:54:24.24
I'm saying, I have worn it every different type of leg garment in my life.

2738
02:54:24.24 --> 02:54:28.24
So the joggers these are the most comfortable and the best.

2739
02:54:28.24 --> 02:54:30.24
More than the joggers.

2740
02:54:30.24 --> 02:54:31.24
Yeah.

2741
02:54:31.24 --> 02:54:34.24
Well, I didn't really, the joggers aren't for me.

2742
02:54:34.24 --> 02:54:35.24
And they don't look normal.

2743
02:54:35.24 --> 02:54:36.24
And they don't feel normal.

2744
02:54:36.24 --> 02:54:39.24
This is my little theory hypothesis, whatever.

2745
02:54:39.24 --> 02:54:40.24
You put on the joggers.

2746
02:54:40.24 --> 02:54:44.24
You felt the physical comfort, but the psychological and emotional discomfort trumped it.

2747
02:54:44.24 --> 02:54:47.24
So it can't be the front runner of comfort.

2748
02:54:47.24 --> 02:54:48.24
Same same thing.

2749
02:54:48.24 --> 02:54:49.24
I'm going to tell you, no.

2750
02:54:49.24 --> 02:54:50.24
You're actually wrong.

2751
02:54:50.24 --> 02:54:53.24
I will tell you, the Delta 68 jeans are as well.

2752
02:54:53.24 --> 02:54:57.24
Or as comfortable, if not more comfortable than the joggers.

2753
02:54:57.24 --> 02:54:59.24
Physically, physically, more comfortable.

2754
02:54:59.24 --> 02:55:02.24
If I had to sleep in one or the other, I'd pick the jeans.

2755
02:55:02.24 --> 02:55:05.24
I'm not going to, um, what do you call?

2756
02:55:05.24 --> 02:55:07.24
You're not going to call me a liar.

2757
02:55:07.24 --> 02:55:08.24
I'm not going to call you a liar.

2758
02:55:08.24 --> 02:55:10.24
I'm not going to review your own opinion.

2759
02:55:10.24 --> 02:55:14.24
So hey, man, all good, but on a factual level.

2760
02:55:14.24 --> 02:55:17.24
I'm just going to say, I don't know 100%.

2761
02:55:17.24 --> 02:55:19.24
If I agree with you, what?

2762
02:55:19.24 --> 02:55:20.24
Okay.

2763
02:55:20.24 --> 02:55:25.24
So there's two theoretical presumptions that are being made by each of us.

2764
02:55:25.24 --> 02:55:29.24
One of them is that the joggers are the most comfortable leg garments ever.

2765
02:55:29.24 --> 02:55:31.24
Not as functional, by the way.

2766
02:55:31.24 --> 02:55:33.24
Or just as functional.

2767
02:55:33.24 --> 02:55:40.24
No, but the Delta 68's, in my opinion, are the most not only functional, but also most comfortable.

2768
02:55:40.24 --> 02:55:41.24
Okay.

2769
02:55:41.24 --> 02:55:42.24
So there you go.

2770
02:55:42.24 --> 02:55:43.24
There you go.

2771
02:55:43.24 --> 02:55:46.24
Hey, you know, when we get them, we can see for ourselves, you know?

2772
02:55:46.24 --> 02:55:49.24
And if you want to get them, you're getting them from orange and main.

2773
02:55:49.24 --> 02:55:51.24
Which is also where you can get supplements.

2774
02:55:51.24 --> 02:55:52.24
Yes.

2775
02:55:52.24 --> 02:55:53.24
So it's joint supplements.

2776
02:55:53.24 --> 02:55:54.24
Very important.

2777
02:55:54.24 --> 02:55:55.24
Very important.

2778
02:55:55.24 --> 02:55:56.24
Join some of them.

2779
02:55:56.24 --> 02:55:57.24
Join warfare.

2780
02:55:57.24 --> 02:55:58.24
Crile, super-crile oil.

2781
02:55:58.24 --> 02:56:02.24
Also additional protein in the form of dessert called moch.

2782
02:56:02.24 --> 02:56:07.24
Also a version for the warrior kids, or your kid moch.

2783
02:56:07.24 --> 02:56:10.24
Many different flavors.

2784
02:56:10.24 --> 02:56:13.24
That's the one you're going to have to choose for yourself.

2785
02:56:13.24 --> 02:56:14.24
Yeah.

2786
02:56:14.24 --> 02:56:18.24
I'm not going to say, hey, mint chocolate is factually the best one.

2787
02:56:18.24 --> 02:56:20.24
Well, that's a matter of opinion.

2788
02:56:20.24 --> 02:56:22.24
It's not like the Delta 68's.

2789
02:56:22.24 --> 02:56:24.24
It's a matter of fact well questionable.

2790
02:56:24.24 --> 02:56:26.24
Fact will say.

2791
02:56:26.24 --> 02:56:27.24
That's got that.

2792
02:56:27.24 --> 02:56:29.24
Got chocolate white tea as well.

2793
02:56:29.24 --> 02:56:32.24
Don't forget about the the chocolate discipline in a go.

2794
02:56:32.24 --> 02:56:35.24
The chocolate discipline can.

2795
02:56:35.24 --> 02:56:37.24
It's so good.

2796
02:56:37.24 --> 02:56:38.24
It's so good.

2797
02:56:38.24 --> 02:56:42.24
And it makes you feel really good.

2798
02:56:42.24 --> 02:56:44.24
Sir, that's the one.

2799
02:56:44.24 --> 02:56:45.24
It gets you up on step.

2800
02:56:45.24 --> 02:56:46.24
We'll say.

2801
02:56:46.24 --> 02:56:47.24
Sure.

2802
02:56:47.24 --> 02:56:48.24
If you're going to train.

2803
02:56:48.24 --> 02:56:52.24
If you trained against a clone of yourself and one of you had

2804
02:56:52.24 --> 02:56:54.24
Jocco discipline go.

2805
02:56:54.24 --> 02:56:55.24
And the other one didn't.

2806
02:56:55.24 --> 02:57:00.24
The one with Jocco discipline go would win 100% of the time.

2807
02:57:00.24 --> 02:57:01.24
100% of the time.

2808
02:57:01.24 --> 02:57:02.24
Yeah, no question.

2809
02:57:02.24 --> 02:57:03.24
Am I wrong?

2810
02:57:03.24 --> 02:57:04.24
Double blind.

2811
02:57:04.24 --> 02:57:05.24
No, that's been tested by the way.

2812
02:57:05.24 --> 02:57:06.24
Oh, yeah.

2813
02:57:06.24 --> 02:57:07.24
We can test that with you and Jade.

2814
02:57:07.24 --> 02:57:08.24
Well, twins.

2815
02:57:08.24 --> 02:57:10.24
You know, theoretically no, but.

2816
02:57:10.24 --> 02:57:12.24
No, your twins though.

2817
02:57:12.24 --> 02:57:14.24
Sorry, theoretically yes, but.

2818
02:57:14.24 --> 02:57:16.24
I'll give you the Jocco discipline go.

2819
02:57:16.24 --> 02:57:18.24
You'll go against J.

2820
02:57:18.24 --> 02:57:19.24
Proving.

2821
02:57:19.24 --> 02:57:20.24
And we proven.

2822
02:57:20.24 --> 02:57:21.24
Yeah.

2823
02:57:21.24 --> 02:57:22.24
That's a.

2824
02:57:22.24 --> 02:57:24.24
I can take all this stuff up at originator.com or you.

2825
02:57:24.24 --> 02:57:28.24
The supplement stuff you can get at the vitamin shop, which is.

2826
02:57:28.24 --> 02:57:32.24
Retail outlet all over the place.

2827
02:57:32.24 --> 02:57:33.24
And they're stocking up.

2828
02:57:33.24 --> 02:57:36.24
If they were low on stock, we're taking care of that.

2834
02:57:50.24 --> 02:57:54.24
As opposed to what I thought, I thought it was like a letter to who survived.

Little bit of compression.

It's very functional garment as it were.

2882
02:59:41.24 --> 02:59:42.24
So over the game.

2883
02:59:42.24 --> 02:59:43.24
Well, here's the thing.

2884
02:59:43.24 --> 02:59:45.24
I just heard.

2885
02:59:45.24 --> 02:59:46.24
I was informed.

2886
02:59:46.24 --> 02:59:47.24
Yes.

2887
02:59:47.24 --> 02:59:56.24

Oh.

2890
02:59:58.24 --> 02:59:59.24
Yeah.

2891
02:59:59.24 --> 03:00:00.24
All right.

2892
03:00:00.24 --> 03:00:01.24
Well, let's just make that a little clearer.

2893
03:00:01.24 --> 03:00:05.24
They sent two bars to my house.

2894
03:00:05.24 --> 03:00:07.24
Neither one of those was labeled echo.

2895
03:00:07.24 --> 03:00:08.24
Okay.

2896
03:00:08.24 --> 03:00:09.24
I just put it to you like that.

2897
03:00:09.24 --> 03:00:11.24
But I will say this.

2898
03:00:11.24 --> 03:00:15.24
Killer soap is the best soap ever and I'm not even kidding.

2899
03:00:15.24 --> 03:00:17.24
It is so good.

2900
03:00:17.24 --> 03:00:20.24
It's, it's everything I ever could have imagined.

2901
03:00:20.24 --> 03:00:21.24
It is soap.

2902
03:00:21.24 --> 03:00:24.24
It's a square, most industrial looking bar.

2903
03:00:24.24 --> 03:00:26.24
It's got a skull on it.

2904
03:00:26.24 --> 03:00:28.24
And it says killer scope.

2905
03:00:28.24 --> 03:00:29.24
It's killer soap.

2906
03:00:29.24 --> 03:00:31.24
And it's black.

2907
03:00:31.24 --> 03:00:33.24
Black soap.

2908
03:00:33.24 --> 03:00:34.24
Yeah.

2909
03:00:34.24 --> 03:00:37.24
And we're going to sell it on our.

2910
03:00:37.24 --> 03:00:38.24
Yeah.

2911
03:00:38.24 --> 03:00:39.24

2912
03:00:39.24 --> 03:00:41.24
So soon you'll be able to get jockel soap.

2913
03:00:41.24 --> 03:00:44.24
You'll be able to get killer soap.

2914
03:00:44.24 --> 03:00:47.24
Made by a kid, a warrior kid, by the way.

2915
03:00:47.24 --> 03:00:49.24
So there you go.

2916
03:00:49.24 --> 03:00:50.24
Yep.

2917
03:00:50.24 --> 03:00:51.24
It's true.

2918
03:00:51.24 --> 03:00:53.24
Also, we have a YouTube channel.

2919
03:00:53.24 --> 03:00:54.24
Official.

2920
03:00:54.24 --> 03:00:57.24
Got a little check mark on our YouTube channel, by the way.

2921
03:00:57.24 --> 03:00:58.24
Brother, that's something.

2922
03:00:58.24 --> 03:00:59.24
It's not not.

2923
03:00:59.24 --> 03:01:00.24
I did not.

2924
03:01:00.24 --> 03:01:01.24
I was not aware.

2925
03:01:01.24 --> 03:01:02.24
It's official.

2926
03:01:02.24 --> 03:01:03.24
Anyway, that just, you know, okay.

2927
03:01:03.24 --> 03:01:04.24
That's what it means.

2928
03:01:04.24 --> 03:01:05.24
But here's the.

2929
03:01:05.24 --> 03:01:07.24
Here's what it actually means.

2930
03:01:07.24 --> 03:01:09.24
I have no idea what this means.

2931
03:01:09.24 --> 03:01:13.24
Well, sometimes people will, they'll take your content.

2932
03:01:13.24 --> 03:01:14.24
Okay.

2933
03:01:14.24 --> 03:01:17.24
And they'll put it on their YouTube channel, which is, you know, it spreads the words.

2934
03:01:17.24 --> 03:01:19.24
So that's cool.

2935
03:01:19.24 --> 03:01:24.24
But, you know, sometimes if people want it, because there was a time where someone's trying to kind of impersonate a little bit.

2936
03:01:24.24 --> 03:01:26.24
Or it could have been misconsure.

2937
03:01:26.24 --> 03:01:27.24
You know, so people might not be able to tell.

2938
03:01:27.24 --> 03:01:28.24
Right.

2939
03:01:28.24 --> 03:01:30.24
But unless you get check mark boom, they know that's the official one.

2940
03:01:30.24 --> 03:01:31.24
That's what the check mark is.

2941
03:01:31.24 --> 03:01:32.24
So we're kind of in the game now.

2942
03:01:32.24 --> 03:01:33.24
Yeah, we're official.

2943
03:01:33.24 --> 03:01:34.24
I'm just a percent.

2944
03:01:34.24 --> 03:01:37.24
Anyway, I'm YouTube channel for the video version of this podcast.

2945
03:01:37.24 --> 03:01:40.24
If you want to see what Rose, Shin, looks like.

2946
03:01:40.24 --> 03:01:41.24
Yes.

2947
03:01:41.24 --> 03:01:43.24
Then you can check it out here.

2948
03:01:43.24 --> 03:01:46.24
You can also see Echo makes some.

2949
03:01:46.24 --> 03:01:48.24
What he calls enhanced videos.

2950
03:01:48.24 --> 03:01:50.24
They're visually enhanced.

2951
03:01:50.24 --> 03:01:53.24
We don't know if it's necessarily an improvement all the time.

2952
03:01:53.24 --> 03:01:54.24
On reality.

2953
03:01:54.24 --> 03:01:56.24
I kind of think it is an improvement on reality.

2954
03:01:56.24 --> 03:01:57.24
Something.

2955
03:01:57.24 --> 03:02:00.24
I think sometimes Echo's vision of the world is a little bit better than everyone.

2956
03:02:00.24 --> 03:02:02.24
Then the normal vision of the world.

2957
03:02:02.24 --> 03:02:03.24
Just a little in and out.

2958
03:02:03.24 --> 03:02:07.24
Why not if I speak, why not have things exploding around me?

2959
03:02:07.24 --> 03:02:09.24
I think it works.

2960
03:02:09.24 --> 03:02:10.24
So there's that.

2961
03:02:10.24 --> 03:02:12.24

And while we will not dwell, we certainly will not forget.

3009
03:05:55.24 --> 03:06:13.24
And to the military, service members out there that have fought and continued to fight to protect the weak, to liberate the enslaved, to bring the light of freedom into the world.

3010
03:06:13.24 --> 03:06:34.24
Like those forces that liberated the concentration camps, thank you all for your service. And the same goes to our police and law enforcement, to our firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and Border Patrol and Secret Service.

3011
03:06:34.24 --> 03:07:03.24
You also make sacrifices to protect us and we thank you for that. And everyone else out there, you know, clearly we have seen today through Rose's story once again, that human beings are capable of absolutely horrific.

3012
03:07:03.24 --> 03:07:08.24
And hideous evil.

3013
03:07:08.24 --> 03:07:27.24
But we've also seen that human beings are capable of overcoming those satanic forces in the world and of maintaining hope against the darkness.

3014
03:07:27.24 --> 03:07:35.24
And in the end, we can win.

3015
03:07:35.24 --> 03:07:47.24
We can win. So fight on, do the right thing and no matter what, do not give up hope.

3016
03:07:47.24 --> 03:07:58.24
And that's all we've got for tonight. So until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
