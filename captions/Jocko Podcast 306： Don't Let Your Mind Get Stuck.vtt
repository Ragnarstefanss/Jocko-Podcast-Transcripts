00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.84
This is Jocopontcast number 306 with echo Charles and me. Jocoboiling good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:05.84 --> 00:00:10.96
And also joining us again tonight Dave Burke good evening Dave good evening

3
00:00:11.44 --> 00:00:18.56
So I said this book was gonna take a while I actually said that to you of a year ago that when we do this book's gonna take a while

4
00:00:19.28 --> 00:00:22.40
But we are going to continue our review of the book on

5
00:00:22.88 --> 00:00:27.20
These psychology of military incompetence which we started on podcast 303

6
00:00:27.20 --> 00:00:32.64
303 304 305 here we are on 306 and there's gonna be more

7
00:00:33.36 --> 00:00:41.68
So if you haven't listened to 303 304 305 go back listen to those and if you have less than those then what you heard on those was basically the setup

8
00:00:42.24 --> 00:00:44.80
It was the setup it was the background information

9
00:00:45.76 --> 00:00:54.08
That we have been that we need to get into the actual theories of how psychology plays a role in military incompetence

10
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:57.52
And with that let's let's get back to the book

11
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:04.40
So this this part of the book is called part two and this is where we're no longer covering historical

12
00:01:05.60 --> 00:01:07.60
Incidents or battles

13
00:01:08.40 --> 00:01:16.000
Although the reason I had to read them all was because he does refer back to him quite a bit and I will say as I went through the as I as I was kind of navigating

14
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.20
How to do this?

15
00:01:17.20 --> 00:01:22.16
I'm not going back as much as he is so when he goes back I might not cover every single one he goes back a little bit more

16
00:01:22.72 --> 00:01:24.000
but

17
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.28
So

18
00:01:25.28 --> 00:01:27.12
This part of the book is what's

19
00:01:27.92 --> 00:01:31.92
What he's actually trying to figure out how does how does psychology play a role in incompetence?

20
00:01:31.92 --> 00:01:35.68
So here we go chapter 13 is there a case to answer

21
00:01:36.64 --> 00:01:39.60
He says that now that we have completed his survey of sorry covering

22
00:01:40.16 --> 00:01:46.32
100 years of military misapps what conclusions can be drawn regarding the incidents

23
00:01:46.32 --> 00:01:54.48
of military incompetence. There are a number of possible answers first. The it could be argued that so called incompetence to high levels of command is really a

24
00:01:54.48 --> 00:01:56.48
Figma of the imagination of

25
00:01:56.64 --> 00:02:00.000
vindictive inaccurate or untrue throw historians

26
00:02:00.88 --> 00:02:09.44
So that's one conclusion a second conclusion might be what seems to have been military incompetence was really due to other non-military factors

27
00:02:09.76 --> 00:02:11.76
Such as governmental stingingists

28
00:02:11.76 --> 00:02:15.04
They grieve of the weather and sheer bad luck a

29
00:02:17.12 --> 00:02:24.24
Third conclusion might be that since every military action is an uncontrolled experiment in the sense that it can never be known what would

30
00:02:24.48 --> 00:02:30.42
Have been the outcome had been this had decisions been different there remains an almost unimaginable possibility that

31
00:02:30.72 --> 00:02:36.88
Things might have been worse that what was done did represent the least disasterous of

32
00:02:37.52 --> 00:02:39.52
possible courses open

33
00:02:39.52 --> 00:02:41.52
So

34
00:02:41.52 --> 00:02:47.68
There are some different reasons why you could say well, you know, it's not really military incompetence. It's just that historians or jerks

35
00:02:48.72 --> 00:02:56.000
It's just that there's factors that no one can control and that actually these decisions that were made were good

36
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.20
But you know, it's just a bad situation so these are the best things that could happen

37
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:04.48
As response to that is no one would deny there's more to grain of truth and all these propositions cool

38
00:03:04.48 --> 00:03:10.86
Facts do get distorted and then the telling disasters are indeed more newsworthy than successes

39
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:15.36
Riders undoubtedly do enjoy painting the worst possible picture of their particular

40
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:18.16
Bet noires many

41
00:03:18.16 --> 00:03:20.96
Generals have had to contend with an up-to-toed

42
00:03:21.84 --> 00:03:27.22
Unformed interference and the stingingists of their political masters and of course things could have been worse

43
00:03:28.48 --> 00:03:32.72
There are counter arguments however because they are

44
00:03:32.72 --> 00:03:40.72
Surrogate father figures people are only too ready and anxious to love their adnelson generals particular a time of war

45
00:03:40.72 --> 00:03:44.08
We see that a lot right the if someone was in the military

46
00:03:45.04 --> 00:03:47.44
Then they must be awesome and

47
00:03:48.40 --> 00:03:50.40
And recent years that's gotten

48
00:03:50.96 --> 00:03:53.36
I would say even more

49
00:03:53.76 --> 00:04:01.52
prolific if someone's that then anything they say has some merit and value and then you figure if they're a vet

50
00:04:01.52 --> 00:04:06.40
Whatever they say has merit value if they were an admiral or they were in a general then they must just be awesome

51
00:04:06.40 --> 00:04:08.40
They just must be speaking the truth

52
00:04:10.80 --> 00:04:12.80
Which we know not to be true?

53
00:04:13.60 --> 00:04:21.28
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit under the circumstances this book takes the view that certain sorts of incompetence have been an enduring

54
00:04:21.52 --> 00:04:28.52
Feature of the military scene and that amongst the millions of officers and men who have fought heroically and efficiently

55
00:04:28.52 --> 00:04:32.36
Often under the most trying conditions. There have marched a small

56
00:04:32.68 --> 00:04:39.000
But influential number whose ability has fallen far short of that required by the positions which they held

57
00:04:39.24 --> 00:04:43.000
So again, he likes to point this out from time to time and this is one of those times that

58
00:04:43.56 --> 00:04:48.04
This isn't about every military officer and I'm not making this about every military officer

59
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:50.84
I worked for awesome military officers Dave

60
00:04:51.40 --> 00:04:55.64
Yeah at every level there are great military officers every level every service

61
00:04:55.64 --> 00:05:01.48
There's great military officers, but it is interesting he says a small but influential number

62
00:05:02.28 --> 00:05:08.60
So these are people that are totally inept at being military leaders and yet they end up in really powerful positions

63
00:05:09.64 --> 00:05:15.24
He says two questions and then occur is there any common pattern to this incompetence and

64
00:05:15.80 --> 00:05:18.68
If there is when's does it arise as

65
00:05:18.68 --> 00:05:26.44
a first step towards answering these questions. Let us try and summarize that data contained in the foregoing chapters in brief then

66
00:05:27.08 --> 00:05:29.08
military incompetence involves

67
00:05:31.24 --> 00:05:32.44
one

68
00:05:32.44 --> 00:05:40.36
A serious wastage of human resources and failures to observe one of the first principles of war economy of force

69
00:05:42.84 --> 00:05:47.08
This failure derives in part from an inability to make war swiftly

70
00:05:47.08 --> 00:05:51.80
It also derives from certain attitudes of mind which we shall consider presently

71
00:05:52.28 --> 00:05:57.40
So that's the number one thing that's showing that someone's in a nepp leader is when they have

72
00:05:58.68 --> 00:06:01.32
Massive wastage of human life

73
00:06:03.24 --> 00:06:05.40
Number two a fundamental

74
00:06:05.56 --> 00:06:13.16
Conservatism and clinging to out-worn tradition and inability to profit from past experience

75
00:06:13.16 --> 00:06:18.44
Owing in part two refusal to admit past mistakes G

76
00:06:21.08 --> 00:06:28.44
Do we even have to go any deeper on that one or is everyone just immediately understanding what's going on with that if you can't admit your past mistakes

77
00:06:28.44 --> 00:06:35.40
If you can't take ownership of human snakes, you don't make any improvement. It also involves a failure to use or tendency to misuse

78
00:06:35.88 --> 00:06:37.88
Available technology

79
00:06:39.08 --> 00:06:41.08
This one's in massive

80
00:06:41.08 --> 00:06:43.08
profit from past experience

81
00:06:44.28 --> 00:06:47.08
Failure to profit from past experience. You don't learn anything

82
00:06:47.64 --> 00:06:51.24
Number three a tendency to reject or ignore information

83
00:06:51.96 --> 00:06:53.40
Which is

84
00:06:53.40 --> 00:06:57.56
Unpalatable or which conflicts with preconceptions

85
00:07:00.04 --> 00:07:05.96
Number four a tendency to underestimate the enemy and overestimate the capabilities of one's own side

86
00:07:05.96 --> 00:07:11.96
Indecisiveness number five indecisiveness and a tendency to

87
00:07:12.04 --> 00:07:14.68
Abdicate from the role of decision maker

88
00:07:16.44 --> 00:07:19.80
Number six an obstinate persistence in a given task

89
00:07:20.60 --> 00:07:23.32
Despite strong contrary evidence

90
00:07:25.08 --> 00:07:28.20
Obstint persistence in a given task. That's when you are this is a

91
00:07:28.92 --> 00:07:32.28
I don't know if you guys have anything like this Dave, but when you're parachuting

92
00:07:32.28 --> 00:07:38.76
What one of the ways that people die when parachuting is they have a problem with their main parachute

93
00:07:39.72 --> 00:07:46.20
And they just keep trying to fix that problem. They get target fixation and they just they just and they never go to the reserve

94
00:07:46.20 --> 00:07:48.20
They never go to the reserve

95
00:07:48.20 --> 00:07:51.96
Yeah, can that happen in the cockpit? Yeah, absolutely and I

96
00:07:52.60 --> 00:07:57.56
Maybe a slightly different different version of that is you can have a system that is a you know

97
00:07:57.56 --> 00:08:03.40
It's a critical system that you need but it wouldn't be the difference between returning home safely and not

98
00:08:03.40 --> 00:08:08.44
And but you'll you'll spend so much time trying to resolve the problem that system is causing that it can lead you to

99
00:08:08.76 --> 00:08:12.92
Focusing on that so much that that you stop paying attention other things and a lead you to a misapp

100
00:08:13.40 --> 00:08:15.56
When even though it could be a real problem

101
00:08:15.80 --> 00:08:19.08
It should never lead you down the path of of crashing or losing the airplane and

102
00:08:20.60 --> 00:08:22.60
What you really need to do is

103
00:08:22.60 --> 00:08:27.88
It ignores probably the wrong word, but if you can't solve this move move on to something else and get the airplane back safely

104
00:08:27.88 --> 00:08:30.52
And they'll spend people who devote 100% of their attention to that

105
00:08:31.08 --> 00:08:35.16
All the way to the point that they crash their plane as a result of it when it would would not have caused a crash

106
00:08:35.56 --> 00:08:38.20
It's kind of crazy and that human element of

107
00:08:38.92 --> 00:08:41.40
The fixation I think is the word you use the fixation on that

108
00:08:41.72 --> 00:08:47.24
You know I was just talking about this at the master we are genetically programmed to fixate yes

109
00:08:47.24 --> 00:08:54.76
Because if you're a caveman and you can't concentrate on the tiger that's you know styling up on you and you're distracted by other things

110
00:08:55.08 --> 00:08:59.40
Then you're gonna die right so we're programmed to focus on what's right in front of us

111
00:08:59.40 --> 00:09:02.60
That's why people so often lose strategic vision

112
00:09:02.60 --> 00:09:06.68
And they can't detach and they don't see what else has happened on that's that's why you get flanked

113
00:09:06.84 --> 00:09:11.96
That's why you keep trying to fix your parachute until you hit the dirt or why you concentrate on some instrument panel

114
00:09:12.60 --> 00:09:15.80
Until you run out of fuel or you run into a mountain exactly

115
00:09:15.80 --> 00:09:21.40
What's the term when someone hit some mountain with no

116
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:24.28
Like no brakes or whatever yeah

117
00:09:25.88 --> 00:09:29.40
We call it see fit controlled flight into terrain

118
00:09:30.04 --> 00:09:35.32
Which means you're fully in control of the aircraft as you do it as you hit that mountain

119
00:09:37.16 --> 00:09:39.88
Because you are so fixated on something else

120
00:09:40.84 --> 00:09:43.80
You know it's not like hey, I'm tumbling out of the sky. I'm trying to save this airplane

121
00:09:43.80 --> 00:09:46.68
I hit the ground it's like hey I'm flying perfectly

122
00:09:47.24 --> 00:09:51.16
Normal flying I might be I'm focused I'm fixated or focusing on something that's a problem

123
00:09:51.24 --> 00:09:55.72
But I'm going to fully control the level flight into the ground into the mountain that is totally avoidable

124
00:09:55.72 --> 00:09:57.96
Had it not been for that fixation. It's common

125
00:09:58.44 --> 00:10:02.12
It's as far as miss abskow it's not uncommon. It's not uncommon

126
00:10:02.52 --> 00:10:10.36
Well the the first time I remember hearing that was when Kobe Bryant's helicopter crashed and I think that was because they couldn't see

127
00:10:10.36 --> 00:10:15.40
Right they they couldn't see but there was nothing wrong with helicopter all they were just supplying and he

128
00:10:15.64 --> 00:10:26.20
Obviously, they I think they were in a fog and so got disoriented and just flew just full speed no factor into the into the mountain yeah and like the worst versions of that is

129
00:10:27.56 --> 00:10:29.56
They're all terrible is

130
00:10:29.56 --> 00:10:34.36
I'm I'm I'm in a dive like I'm in a deep 45 degree dive. I'm diving down towards the target

131
00:10:34.36 --> 00:10:38.04
Which is what you're supposed to do you're going to get it to it out to it and you're going to dive down towards the target to help

132
00:10:38.04 --> 00:10:42.12
Refine we're going to drop the bomb and I'm going to focus on the display that make sure that my

133
00:10:42.76 --> 00:10:50.20
Targeting my reticle the aiming point is exactly where I want it. I'll just keep it adjusting that targeting point to be exactly where I want it

134
00:10:50.60 --> 00:10:54.92
And I'll go through my minimum altitudes and I will fly straight into the ground all the while just

135
00:10:55.64 --> 00:11:00.20
Focusing on that targeting point and I'll never try to pull up. I'll never try to recover

136
00:11:00.20 --> 00:11:03.24
I'll ignore warnings that say your altitudes getting low and

137
00:11:03.24 --> 00:11:09.72
Pile to fly directly into the ground working on something else in a perfectly safe effective finding. Yeah, no problems at all

138
00:11:09.72 --> 00:11:12.36
That is literally the exact same thing. It happens to guys skydiving well

139
00:11:12.36 --> 00:11:15.72
It's a little bit different because of where the guy's skydiving there trying to fix a problem

140
00:11:15.72 --> 00:11:19.16
Usually I'm supposed to throw some cases. You know, this is why

141
00:11:19.72 --> 00:11:24.20
But again, refer to back to the most girls talking about the the leadership loop and yeah

142
00:11:24.20 --> 00:11:29.80
The main bullet at the bottom both for the who to loop and the leadership loop is you can't get stuck

143
00:11:29.80 --> 00:11:32.44
You can't get stuck focused on one thing and

144
00:11:32.44 --> 00:11:35.32
And when you do get focused on one thing

145
00:11:37.72 --> 00:11:41.32
There's just there's just there's the rest of the world doesn't stop

146
00:11:42.28 --> 00:11:46.36
Right whenever you're focusing one thing in life the rest of the world doesn't stop

147
00:11:46.36 --> 00:11:49.32
The rest of the world's gonna keep going if you don't look around it's gonna be a problem

148
00:11:50.04 --> 00:11:54.76
And that's what this number is number six an obstinate persistence in a given task

149
00:11:55.32 --> 00:12:01.96
Despite strong contrary evidence that was number six number seven of failure to exploit a

150
00:12:01.96 --> 00:12:05.80
Situation gained an attendancy to quote poll punches

151
00:12:06.52 --> 00:12:08.52
Rather than push home an attack

152
00:12:10.20 --> 00:12:13.64
Number eight of failure to make adequate reconnaissance

153
00:12:14.44 --> 00:12:21.16
Number nine a predilection for frontal assaults often against the enemies strongest point

154
00:12:23.64 --> 00:12:25.64
And again

155
00:12:25.40 --> 00:12:27.40
Even what's again at the master

156
00:12:27.96 --> 00:12:29.24
I'm

157
00:12:29.24 --> 00:12:35.000
Trying to explain to people because you know there's people that want that they would they just want to hear you say look

158
00:12:35.16 --> 00:12:39.48
So someone's called some problems. You just gotta go direct it. That's what everybody wants to hear and it makes

159
00:12:40.12 --> 00:12:47.08
So much intuitive sense to think you know what I don't like Dave's plan. I just need to go tell him Dave. I don't like your plan

160
00:12:48.76 --> 00:12:50.76
And it's just

161
00:12:50.76 --> 00:12:52.92
So obvious that when I say Dave

162
00:12:52.92 --> 00:12:57.000
I don't like your plan immediately Dave is defensive you by the way once you get defensive

163
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.12
You're not listening to anything else. I say and now we're not making a new progress

164
00:13:00.28 --> 00:13:02.84
So even though it seems like it's the most efficient thing to do it's not

165
00:13:03.56 --> 00:13:06.68
The most efficient thing to do is say hey Dave. I'm looking at your plan

166
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.60
Can you expand on a couple of these points because I don't think I understand them and now his defenses are down

167
00:13:12.76 --> 00:13:16.68
We're having a real conversation my mind is actually open. It's not just a little

168
00:13:17.16 --> 00:13:19.16
Fugazi it's real

169
00:13:19.16 --> 00:13:21.64
And we're having a real conversation we can make progress

170
00:13:21.80 --> 00:13:22.84
But the

171
00:13:22.84 --> 00:13:29.72
Predelection for the frontal assault both on the battlefield and in a conversation with another human being is bad and it leads to failure

172
00:13:31.64 --> 00:13:36.52
Number 10 a belief in brute force rather than the clever roost

173
00:13:38.20 --> 00:13:40.44
So there you go the jujitsu people just cheered

174
00:13:43.40 --> 00:13:47.000
A failure to make use of surprise or deception

175
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.88
Judging people just cheered again. This is the kind of thing when I say that jiu jitsu affected my brain

176
00:13:57.56 --> 00:14:03.24
These are the kind of things those three right there frontal assaults bad that's jujitsu

177
00:14:05.56 --> 00:14:11.24
Believing clever roost instead of brute force that's jujitsu make use of surprise and deception

178
00:14:11.88 --> 00:14:13.88
That's jujitsu

179
00:14:13.88 --> 00:14:20.12
I had a buddy I start he trained you to do i train jitsu but he was very he was sort of

180
00:14:21.08 --> 00:14:25.24
Not training a lot and this was early 90s he trained you know some you know

181
00:14:26.92 --> 00:14:28.60
And I

182
00:14:28.60 --> 00:14:33.40
Was like in my first month of training jiu jitsu all the time with Fabio Santos

183
00:14:34.44 --> 00:14:37.56
And one day this is my buddy Jim I said I

184
00:14:38.28 --> 00:14:42.28
Told him I came back after like a month of training. I said hey man here's the deal

185
00:14:42.28 --> 00:14:48.92
I just I just learned this you can't do one move a one move by itself doesn't work because it's too easy

186
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.28
Defend you got to set people up that's what this whole thing is it's like a trick it's a big trick

187
00:14:55.56 --> 00:14:58.60
And about three days later he and I were rolling

188
00:15:00.20 --> 00:15:04.76
And he freaking was syncing in a choke syncing in a choke

189
00:15:04.76 --> 00:15:10.44
Syncing in a choke and I was like do this guy's not gonna be able to choke me. I know exactly boom you're on lock me

190
00:15:10.76 --> 00:15:12.76
Hahaha

191
00:15:14.84 --> 00:15:20.28
And I was like whole I any he he won hundred percent he got it he was like dude

192
00:15:20.76 --> 00:15:23.72
That's what you just told me and I was like oh my god

193
00:15:24.44 --> 00:15:26.04
so

194
00:15:26.20 --> 00:15:27.24
And he you know

195
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:29.24
At he

196
00:15:29.24 --> 00:15:32.04
Got me because of that thing right there

197
00:15:32.04 --> 00:15:37.88
He listened to me and this guy ended up uh we ended up working together a lot and actually

198
00:15:38.68 --> 00:15:40.68
Just an awesome guy but anyways

199
00:15:42.20 --> 00:15:44.20
He used that thing

200
00:15:44.20 --> 00:15:45.72
He said it up

201
00:15:45.72 --> 00:15:53.56
That little that little surprise number one. It was a surprise number two. It was a roost and number three. It wasn't brute force. It was technique

202
00:15:56.52 --> 00:15:58.52
number 12

203
00:15:58.52 --> 00:16:07.64
An undo readiness to find scape goats for military setbacks. Oh, this is to use Jason Gardner's

204
00:16:08.28 --> 00:16:12.36
term blame thrower these people get out the blame thrower

205
00:16:13.96 --> 00:16:17.72
And the opposite of extreme ownership right I'm just gonna find who I'm gonna blame

206
00:16:19.48 --> 00:16:28.12
A suppression number 13 a suppression or distortion of news from the front usually rationalized as necessary

207
00:16:28.12 --> 00:16:33.32
For morale or security. Oh, you know what that is a really nice way of saying

208
00:16:34.36 --> 00:16:39.72
A suppression or distortion of news from the front usually rationalized as necessary from morale or security

209
00:16:40.12 --> 00:16:42.84
What we're saying here is lying to the troops

210
00:16:44.68 --> 00:16:46.68
Lining to the troops

211
00:16:49.88 --> 00:16:55.24
And then number 14 this one's a little strange a belief in mystical forces

212
00:16:55.24 --> 00:16:58.36
Fate bad luck etc

213
00:16:59.40 --> 00:17:07.08
So there's your there's your list of 14 things that military incompetence involves

214
00:17:08.28 --> 00:17:11.80
That's from all those historical features those are sort of the common themes here

215
00:17:13.40 --> 00:17:19.24
Fast forward a little bit on logical if not humanitarian grounds that maintenance of an efficient force should be the first

216
00:17:19.24 --> 00:17:27.64
Consideration of a military commander other qualities of general ship will avail him nothing if he has no one left to do the fighting so he's focusing on that first one saying

217
00:17:28.20 --> 00:17:30.20
You should keep people alive

218
00:17:31.32 --> 00:17:35.32
And this is something that you know sometimes people ask us

219
00:17:36.04 --> 00:17:38.68
Well, you got the mission and you got the man which one's more important and

220
00:17:40.28 --> 00:17:42.28
It's very easy for me to answer that question

221
00:17:42.84 --> 00:17:46.92
The people come first because if you don't have people you can't do any more missions

222
00:17:46.92 --> 00:17:48.92
So

223
00:17:49.32 --> 00:17:53.48
Yes, the mission is absolutely a top priority

224
00:17:54.04 --> 00:17:56.84
But it's not the top priority you got to take care of your people

225
00:17:57.64 --> 00:18:04.32
Continuing on here excessive loss of life and high casualty figures would therefore seem like a likely indicator of military incompetence

226
00:18:04.32 --> 00:18:17.20
Noon cases of what seemed to be purely administrative incompetence as for example in what John Laffin has described as the imbacill

227
00:18:18.88 --> 00:18:26.56
Waltern expedition of 1809 though the purpose of this expedition was to attack Antwerp the troops were in fact

228
00:18:26.64 --> 00:18:29.44
Captain waiting for eight weeks on unhealthy

229
00:18:29.44 --> 00:18:37.60
Watcher in island in Zeeland in the event and owing to the procrastination of the military commander

230
00:18:38.16 --> 00:18:42.64
Lord Chatham and the naval commander serritchered straight in

231
00:18:44.08 --> 00:18:46.08
7,000 men died

232
00:18:46.08 --> 00:18:52.72
14,000 had their health permanently ruined and thousands more became ill mostly from malaria

233
00:18:54.16 --> 00:18:56.80
Only 217 were killed in action

234
00:18:56.80 --> 00:19:03.60
So I just the occasion catch that 7,000 died from disease and

235
00:19:04.40 --> 00:19:06.40
And

236
00:19:07.84 --> 00:19:13.12
Just a disaster from an administrative perspective but only 217 were killed in action

237
00:19:14.48 --> 00:19:21.28
While the while men were while dying men were given no attention and little to eat as Laffin remarks sick men were expendable

238
00:19:21.28 --> 00:19:31.20
Fast forward a little bit the second class of man power wastage is that involving casualties from

239
00:19:31.44 --> 00:19:39.12
Enemy action as a result of the incompetent planning of senior military commanders the men who perished in the attack on for Ruyah in the

240
00:19:39.12 --> 00:19:45.04
Indian mute mute me the thousands of casualties from the German's use of gas in 1915 the 13,000

241
00:19:45.04 --> 00:19:52.72
Winning to captivity following the siege of cut and the 138,000 casualties of Singapore the 8,500 Americans who died in the

242
00:19:52.88 --> 00:19:54.08
Arden's offensive

243
00:19:54.08 --> 00:20:00.88
1944 and the 17,000 British American impolish who were killed wounded or reported missing at RM RM

244
00:20:01.52 --> 00:20:03.52
Fall into this category

245
00:20:03.84 --> 00:20:06.40
So he's got these I should have broken this out earlier

246
00:20:06.88 --> 00:20:08.40
He's going through the

247
00:20:08.40 --> 00:20:11.52
The three different types or the different types of how you waste

248
00:20:11.52 --> 00:20:15.28
People's lives the first one is just administrative

249
00:20:16.48 --> 00:20:22.40
The second one is bad planning and in the third one is the third and most

250
00:20:22.80 --> 00:20:29.20
Cossely type of man power wastage is that resulting from a deliberate policy of attrition adopted by

251
00:20:29.36 --> 00:20:32.40
Commanders who regarded soldiers as wholly expendable

252
00:20:32.40 --> 00:20:42.24
Generals for whom the conservation of human life rank lower than in importance than in various other criteria which were governing their actions

253
00:20:43.36 --> 00:20:46.40
This is when your plan is oh a lot of people are gonna die

254
00:20:53.12 --> 00:20:58.80
Fast for a little basis in all this we are anticipating a theory of military incompetence rather different from that held by

255
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:02.16
Proponents of the so called bloody fool theory

256
00:21:03.12 --> 00:21:08.32
Perhaps we are being too complicated perhaps intellectual deficit could explain the data less than before

257
00:21:08.40 --> 00:21:16.08
Considering the other factors contributing to military incompetence first examine this older and more favored hypothesis and so what are you saying here?

258
00:21:16.40 --> 00:21:20.24
There's a lot of people that just say oh they people make mistakes and they make mistakes because they're dumb

259
00:21:20.80 --> 00:21:22.16
They're just dumb

260
00:21:22.16 --> 00:21:24.96
dumb military leaders and that's why they make these mistakes

261
00:21:25.44 --> 00:21:27.44
they're just stupid and

262
00:21:27.44 --> 00:21:31.52
Well, he's gonna talk about the fact that yeah, you can account for some of that

263
00:21:32.64 --> 00:21:34.16
but a

264
00:21:34.16 --> 00:21:36.64
Lot of times you have very intelligent

265
00:21:37.36 --> 00:21:46.08
Leaders making really stupid decisions and obviously his high-profile offices. That's because of their psychological nature

266
00:21:48.96 --> 00:21:52.88
So here we go in the chapter 14 the intellectual ability of senior military commanders

267
00:21:52.88 --> 00:21:59.44
T.E. Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia said I feel a fundamental crippling

268
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.64
In curious and curiousness about our officers too much body and too little head

269
00:22:06.48 --> 00:22:09.52
So obviously he's a military guy and he was very very smart

270
00:22:10.16 --> 00:22:14.40
But he's just saying look I see a lot of people in our ain't too bright too much body too little head

271
00:22:16.88 --> 00:22:21.36
What grounds are there then for the most popular explanation of military incompetence stupidity

272
00:22:21.36 --> 00:22:25.76
There's there's a suggestion that the arms force armed forces do not attract the best brains

273
00:22:26.32 --> 00:22:31.28
A call-up serving the survey in the United States put the status of army officers below that of professors

274
00:22:31.84 --> 00:22:34.32
Physicians clergymen and school teachers

275
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:46.08
As Morris Genowitz remarks a liberal ideology hold that since war is essentially destructive the best minds are attracted to more positive endeavors

276
00:22:46.08 --> 00:22:52.88
Um, that's like one of those statements you got well, you know if you're making that statement

277
00:22:53.52 --> 00:22:58.16
You would if you're a really smart person. Are you thinking hey what do I want to do to I want to go out and

278
00:22:59.20 --> 00:23:03.20
Build the the next great energy platform?

279
00:23:03.60 --> 00:23:07.12
Oh, do I want to go out and kill a bunch of people you think oh well

280
00:23:07.12 --> 00:23:11.12
Maybe the people have a little bit smarter are gonna lean towards building the next great energy platform

281
00:23:12.16 --> 00:23:14.16
That's the that's the statement anyways

282
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:15.52
Yeah

283
00:23:15.52 --> 00:23:19.68
What was the thing with like the bottom the atomic bomb like the technology was like

284
00:23:21.52 --> 00:23:26.64
Made for something or the or the idea was like the technology was made for something

285
00:23:26.64 --> 00:23:31.04
But then you got another group of people were like, oh, that's cool technology. Let's use it for this automatically

286
00:23:31.04 --> 00:23:36.64
You know like for bad stuff. That's all what we always think right a lot of the time where it's like oh, that's good technology

287
00:23:37.20 --> 00:23:42.48
Yeah, who's gonna weapon like someone's gonna weaponize it in it's like that's the fear like you put you and me in a room

288
00:23:42.48 --> 00:23:49.28
And they're like hey, we've we've created this thing that can create a massive amount of energy and you're thinking cool

289
00:23:49.52 --> 00:23:52.96
We can power the world and I'm thinking cool we can blow up our enemies

290
00:23:55.68 --> 00:23:59.68
Yeah, that could be somebody's got to think that way. Yeah

291
00:24:02.08 --> 00:24:07.04
It says here in training for general strip it seems that intellectual ability has not always counted for very much even

292
00:24:07.04 --> 00:24:13.52
Hague the educated soldier became commander and chief of the British army in the first world war despite a poor academic record

293
00:24:14.08 --> 00:24:22.72
This dowerland scott this dower lowland scott described by duff Cooper as the dunce of the family and by Lord George as utterly stupid

294
00:24:23.52 --> 00:24:25.52
So so you are getting some dumb people here

295
00:24:28.64 --> 00:24:33.44
Fast forward a little certainly a brilliant performance in military schools is no guarantee of subsequent ability

296
00:24:33.44 --> 00:24:39.68
General colleague who's the session of defeats culminated in 1881 in his own demise at Mujaba Hill

297
00:24:40.32 --> 00:24:45.36
Had the distinction of passing out of snath college with the highest marks on record

298
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.40
The irrelevance of early scholarship to subsequent general ship also find support in Napoleon and Wellington both of whom achieved very low grades at school

299
00:24:54.80 --> 00:24:58.88
And in more recent times the early academic brilliance of lieutenant general

300
00:24:58.88 --> 00:25:07.36
Perseval evidently availed him little at Singapore so he's given all these other examples right you got Perseval who led that total disaster in Singapore

301
00:25:07.84 --> 00:25:09.84
Who was

302
00:25:09.84 --> 00:25:11.20
Academically brilliant

303
00:25:11.20 --> 00:25:16.32
Napoleon and Wellington who were great generals who were junk at school and another guy

304
00:25:16.64 --> 00:25:22.000
General colleague who is a disaster on the battlefield and yet had the highest marks on record

305
00:25:22.96 --> 00:25:26.80
So the statement is like hey

306
00:25:26.80 --> 00:25:32.96
You could be really smart and do well you could be really smart and do horrible you could be moderately smart and do well

307
00:25:32.96 --> 00:25:37.52
You could be moderately smart do horrible so I think the statement here is like well

308
00:25:38.24 --> 00:25:43.36
It's not intellect is only part of it right intellect is only part of it

309
00:25:46.08 --> 00:25:48.08
What about fighter pilots?

310
00:25:49.04 --> 00:25:53.68
I mean look so in the seal teams for a while they were recruiting these really really smart

311
00:25:53.68 --> 00:25:59.04
Ivy league you know Harvard Yale there's all this whole crew of officers that were coming in

312
00:25:59.36 --> 00:26:03.60
They were clearly highly intellectual smart people and

313
00:26:04.48 --> 00:26:10.08
They stopped recruiting those people so heavily and the reason they stopped recruiting those people so heavily was two reasons

314
00:26:10.08 --> 00:26:12.08
So one was they would do their

315
00:26:12.40 --> 00:26:17.44
One-platoon or two-platoon to get out and go to business school or whatever and two was they weren't that good

316
00:26:17.84 --> 00:26:19.12
Yeah

317
00:26:19.12 --> 00:26:21.60
There there was no there was no correlation

318
00:26:21.60 --> 00:26:25.84
To someone that was really smart to someone that was a really good leader in the battlefield

319
00:26:25.84 --> 00:26:31.28
Yeah, I think it's the same I really do I don't think I don't think the personality profile

320
00:26:31.76 --> 00:26:34.88
You know or even just the motivational profile of

321
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:43.04
A lot of people in the military is all that different certainly when I think about seals and pilots and as often as you and I kind of contrast those two types of people

322
00:26:43.28 --> 00:26:47.36
There's a ton of similarity there and you know the different services and aviation have different

323
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.96
sets of requirements and you know I think

324
00:26:50.96 --> 00:26:59.28
The Marine Corps has the the lowest I guess standard of academic excellence in terms like what you studied in how well you did

325
00:26:59.28 --> 00:27:03.20
I mean the old joke in the Marine Corps was you know if you got a 2.0 and underwater basket

326
00:27:03.20 --> 00:27:09.28
We even you could be a pilot you know as the joke and you know what they were saying really was hey

327
00:27:09.92 --> 00:27:15.76
You know we don't really care what you studied now you got to have a college degree and I think that does demonstrate some

328
00:27:15.76 --> 00:27:21.60
willingness and ability and I'm not sure which is more important to get through a a long-term

329
00:27:21.92 --> 00:27:26.48
Project hey I'm gonna dedicate four years of getting this degree that demonstrates hey you've got some planning

330
00:27:26.48 --> 00:27:33.12
You got some interest you've got some intellect something that's gonna reveal that you're you are have something that's gonna be hard to do

331
00:27:33.12 --> 00:27:37.52
You're gonna be willing to do that and you're getting a four point. Oh, you know in you know

332
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:45.04
Air aerodynamics versus a 2.0 in polysai we don't really care you know that was kind of the Marine Corps's

333
00:27:45.04 --> 00:27:47.36
Genre General approach a little bit different for the other services

334
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:49.68
But I was kind of laughing and trying to

335
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:54.80
Thinking about this thing from a larger standpoint of these great military leaders that

336
00:27:55.52 --> 00:27:58.08
Maybe didn't have the best records academically

337
00:27:58.72 --> 00:28:00.72
In the two thoughts that I had is

338
00:28:01.60 --> 00:28:03.60
The academics and the military aren't that hard

339
00:28:03.60 --> 00:28:09.60
You know me like you don't need to be a genius to get perfect scores on your tests

340
00:28:11.36 --> 00:28:16.64
And I think the ones that don't do that well academically that are that still really do well

341
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:18.64
There's probably a piece in there they're thinking like

342
00:28:19.36 --> 00:28:23.60
This is dumb. There's a waste of my time. What's the what's the minimum grade requirement?

343
00:28:23.60 --> 00:28:27.76
Yeah, cool. I'm gonna get that and there that actually reveals some level of intelligence

344
00:28:27.76 --> 00:28:31.28
I'm not gonna waste my time and all this stuff that I don't really want to be doing

345
00:28:31.28 --> 00:28:35.92
But I'm not gonna fail either so for for you to sort of explain

346
00:28:36.80 --> 00:28:42.08
There's some really good leaders that didn't do so hot and then there's some guys that just were absolutely brilliant on paper that were terrible

347
00:28:42.32 --> 00:28:46.96
That is not a stretch for me and all to picture that in aviation or anywhere

348
00:28:46.96 --> 00:28:48.96
You know, it's like I think I know who those guys are

349
00:28:49.52 --> 00:28:51.52
Yeah, and really

350
00:28:51.52 --> 00:28:55.52
Anything anything there's no there I'm trying to think of a job

351
00:28:56.80 --> 00:28:58.80
Where the full

352
00:28:58.80 --> 00:29:04.96
Where where the the primary thing is only intelligence only intelligence

353
00:29:04.96 --> 00:29:10.64
I'm sure there's some laboratory somewhere or some computer programming thing where

354
00:29:11.12 --> 00:29:14.80
Basically the smartest person is the person that we want that job

355
00:29:15.76 --> 00:29:23.60
But as soon as that person is in charge of people anyone else or in soon as there's some level of creativity or problem solving because there's

356
00:29:23.60 --> 00:29:30.96
You just you what you want is a person that's composite has a bunch of different skills. I mean you would think for being a pilot

357
00:29:32.08 --> 00:29:33.12
Uh

358
00:29:33.12 --> 00:29:37.52
There's gotta be you know that that like the spatial like when I took the officer candid

359
00:29:38.24 --> 00:29:45.52
Test and you've got to do the spatial recognition where how far away is this or is this aircraft or is this bird coming to you or going away from you?

360
00:29:45.52 --> 00:29:47.52
Gotta tell from looking at it

361
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:49.04
Hey, obviously

362
00:29:49.04 --> 00:29:55.84
Someone could be really really smart and suck at that test right not to mention eyesight not to mention

363
00:29:56.40 --> 00:30:00.24
Reaction time like all those different things and then same thing with leadership

364
00:30:00.72 --> 00:30:05.68
You can have someone that's super articulate that's there's there's really articulate people that aren't really that smart

365
00:30:07.60 --> 00:30:10.08
I mean I served with some people like that

366
00:30:10.16 --> 00:30:15.36
They're really articulate they can put a word together. What did people call them when you you know

367
00:30:15.36 --> 00:30:19.76
That's a skill set that like a salesperson. There's really good salespeople. They're not the smartest people normal

368
00:30:19.76 --> 00:30:23.04
But they're incredible at their incredible conversational us. Yeah, right?

369
00:30:23.36 --> 00:30:28.32
But you wouldn't want to put them into a situation where they've got to stand up and talk from people if they don't have that skill

370
00:30:28.32 --> 00:30:37.92
So just because someone is smart that's only like one quarter of the of the of the of the math we got to do here totally and when you're thinking about it from a leadership standpoint

371
00:30:38.88 --> 00:30:40.88
and

372
00:30:40.88 --> 00:30:46.96
The recognition that that leadership requires a whole bunch of different things not just being

373
00:30:46.96 --> 00:30:53.52
You know smart and taking a test or being good at communicating it's the recognition that it requires so many different things

374
00:30:53.92 --> 00:30:57.60
None of these these profiles that he just revealed are a big shock to me

375
00:30:57.60 --> 00:31:02.24
I'm like yep yep. Yep. Those all make sense seals pilots ever in between and yeah

376
00:31:03.12 --> 00:31:07.76
In aviation is there are a couple things that might incline you down that path like if you can naturally get a sense

377
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:12.56
If they show you a diagram of an airplane descending turning and and slow and then you have to match it up

378
00:31:12.88 --> 00:31:20.32
That some people's brains maybe. I can't I can't see that as well as somebody else. Yeah, I could see that and that's gonna account for a small part of it. It might be good to know

379
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:24.48
But that by itself is it's gonna

380
00:31:26.16 --> 00:31:32.72
It's gonna have almost no influence in the long-term success of this person in his career in the military that I could identify

381
00:31:32.72 --> 00:31:38.24
Relatively early on of what the spatial orientation of an airplane was in relation to the ground. Do you want that?

382
00:31:38.24 --> 00:31:40.56
Yeah, that's a good idea. I don't want someone who gets confused

383
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:45.04
But you don't want someone that's totally lost right. I mean even on that test you all you have to do is pass it right

384
00:31:45.36 --> 00:31:49.04
No, that's how you have to and then you know if you and I were in the same thing and I was a little bit worse

385
00:31:49.04 --> 00:31:52.08
I would study it more right figured out more or I'd just after

386
00:31:52.48 --> 00:31:58.56
Whatever two months of looking at this stuff. We're the same. Yes because I figured out how to figure it out. Yeah

387
00:31:58.56 --> 00:32:00.56
That's right. Check

388
00:32:03.60 --> 00:32:09.84
Fast forward a little bit. Fortunately, there are some who have seen the threat to originality and intelligent thinking

389
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:13.60
The Duke of Edinburgh

390
00:32:13.60 --> 00:32:20.08
felt it necessary to say finally as you grow older try not to be afraid of new ideas new original ideas

391
00:32:20.40 --> 00:32:27.52
Can be bad as well as good but whereas an intelligent man with an open mind can demolish a bad idea

392
00:32:27.52 --> 00:32:29.52
by reasoned argument

393
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.48
Those who allow their brains to

394
00:32:32.64 --> 00:32:36.64
Attrophy report resort to meaningless catchphrases to

395
00:32:37.04 --> 00:32:40.48
Duration and finally to anger in the face of anything new

396
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:43.60
This is you know this is Prince Philip

397
00:32:44.48 --> 00:32:46.48
Duke of Edinburgh recently died

398
00:32:46.48 --> 00:32:49.52
I don't know if you saw this funeral, but if you have any

399
00:32:50.96 --> 00:32:52.08
Any

400
00:32:52.08 --> 00:32:54.96
Warm place in your heart for the brits which I certainly do

401
00:32:54.96 --> 00:33:04.000
They is his hurts was a land rover a military land rover that he had had some hand in design he was some sort of

402
00:33:04.32 --> 00:33:08.72
Special transport and that's what they that's what they care of his body and

403
00:33:09.60 --> 00:33:12.56
But here he is this is a this is just an incredible

404
00:33:13.28 --> 00:33:15.28
Thing to think about

405
00:33:15.84 --> 00:33:18.80
And it's an incredible thing to be on watch for you know

406
00:33:18.80 --> 00:33:23.68
I said at the monster I said aim this book at yourself and then I said aim these things to yourself

407
00:33:23.68 --> 00:33:27.36
When you hear stuff like this when I hear stuff like this I aim it at myself

408
00:33:29.52 --> 00:33:33.44
Don't be afraid of new ideas and this is what an intelligent man

409
00:33:34.56 --> 00:33:38.24
With an open mind can demolish a bad idea by reasoned argument and

410
00:33:39.44 --> 00:33:41.44
And what I like about that is I

411
00:33:41.92 --> 00:33:46.48
Always say to myself it Dave if you come to me with a plan or you come to me with an idea and I can't

412
00:33:47.04 --> 00:33:50.48
Convent you that your plan isn't good or that there's a hole in it there's a problem

413
00:33:50.48 --> 00:33:56.64
Then there's something going on here maybe it's my ego maybe it's my emotions maybe I just don't like you

414
00:33:56.88 --> 00:33:59.12
But if I can't explain to you

415
00:33:59.92 --> 00:34:04.000
Why your plan isn't good and the only thing I can find is you know what we're doing it my way

416
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:07.36
The only way I can overcome you is by you know

417
00:34:07.60 --> 00:34:10.88
It well a catch phrase or to be like we've we always done it this way or

418
00:34:11.84 --> 00:34:17.68
We need to stick with the plan right those are just catch phrases and that's what I'm gonna say or I just say

419
00:34:17.68 --> 00:34:24.48
We know Dave's always got his own freaking Dave's always on his own freaking program like I can I can ridicule you or I can just get mad

420
00:34:25.92 --> 00:34:28.16
That's what we sit yeah that third level too

421
00:34:28.16 --> 00:34:32.40
I forgot what the middle one was when he talked about the meeting that's catch phrase and then the third one like resorting to anger

422
00:34:32.56 --> 00:34:35.76
Yeah, you know it's basically just degrees of your ego of just being out of control

423
00:34:35.76 --> 00:34:39.36
Yes, the first one's like I'm just gonna be dismissive of you by a catch phrase of

424
00:34:39.76 --> 00:34:42.88
Jocco talks to me about an idea and I say something like you know

425
00:34:43.52 --> 00:34:44.72
You know

426
00:34:44.72 --> 00:34:46.48
Here comes the new guy with a bread idea

427
00:34:46.48 --> 00:34:51.76
You know like to just kind of push you off and then if you persist and we kind of get to the second level

428
00:34:51.76 --> 00:34:55.68
And I've got some other responsive isn't working the end all about left as I get mad at you

429
00:34:57.52 --> 00:35:02.56
And if I out rank you like the military this whole military experiment then I automatically win

430
00:35:03.12 --> 00:35:08.80
I automatically win because I'll just shut you up because I'm now mad and I'm just gonna resort to what I got as hey

431
00:35:09.44 --> 00:35:13.04
Why don't you just go back to your desk and let me let me let me let me let me

432
00:35:13.04 --> 00:35:16.56
Lead for a little while here since I'm in charge. Yeah, and then you just kind of walk away and that's the end of it

433
00:35:16.56 --> 00:35:18.96
What you want to do is you want to be the Jeff Glover of ideas

434
00:35:19.28 --> 00:35:24.000
So Jeff Glover will go out on the map with you and you you will let you put him in any position

435
00:35:24.16 --> 00:35:28.96
Because he doesn't care he knows you just do and he can get out of it and if he doesn't get out of it

436
00:35:28.96 --> 00:35:33.60
He so if you tap him out and he's like oh, yeah, that was good way to finish because because you know

437
00:35:33.60 --> 00:35:38.08
You started with the rear naked choke and you were able to finish it. Jocco good job, you know like

438
00:35:38.48 --> 00:35:41.68
He doesn't care he's he's he goes not involved at all

439
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:46.64
And he doesn't care and most of the time by the way he gets out because he knows the truth

440
00:35:47.04 --> 00:35:51.04
So that's why I try and be when someone confronts me with an idea. I'm stoked

441
00:35:51.60 --> 00:35:56.96
Oh, you you've seen you got me off balance awesome either I can recover myself because I have good information or a better

442
00:35:56.96 --> 00:36:03.60
Perspective and we can discuss it logically and I can say oh, yeah, and I can point it out to you or you caught me off balance because I'm wrong

443
00:36:03.60 --> 00:36:06.40
And I had a hole in my game and it didn't make any sense

444
00:36:07.12 --> 00:36:09.12
So I'm actually happy about that

445
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:11.12
Open your mind

446
00:36:14.40 --> 00:36:21.12
Fastwater let this inbreeding of the uneducated however was resisted by by the later massy committee who

447
00:36:21.84 --> 00:36:23.84
Depressed by what they found considered that

448
00:36:24.80 --> 00:36:27.68
one the general education of cadets should be continued

449
00:36:28.80 --> 00:36:32.80
To few young officers showed any capacity for command

450
00:36:32.80 --> 00:36:40.96
This was an assessment of what that they were doing three there was too much drill too much rigid discipline and too much cramming for marks

451
00:36:42.88 --> 00:36:49.04
Number four the instructors or mediocre and selected for prowess at games and smartness

452
00:36:49.36 --> 00:36:55.92
Rather than for their knowledge of the subject they had to teach or their qualifications as teachers

453
00:36:55.92 --> 00:37:03.76
Much the same again. This was an assessment started as skipped it, but this was an assessment that got done of how they were training the

454
00:37:04.16 --> 00:37:08.76
Military the army officers and then it says much the same picture has been painted of

455
00:37:09.44 --> 00:37:16.42
Britannia four under of the Royal Naval College of Dartmouth Dartmouth again the emphasis was on blind obedience

456
00:37:17.12 --> 00:37:24.92
Sport and ceremonial with scant regard to intellectual pursuits and little pride in knowing one's job

457
00:37:24.92 --> 00:37:32.44
You know it's funny as soon as you say something like there's too much drill as soon as you say

458
00:37:32.60 --> 00:37:35.08
You know if you're maybe you're thinking hey man

459
00:37:35.08 --> 00:37:38.20
We're spending a lot of time just doing this like stupid drill stuff

460
00:37:38.52 --> 00:37:45.06
There's someone that's like oh you understand the diss what the people and that's what this whole actually that's what this whole book is about

461
00:37:45.44 --> 00:37:52.04
This whole book is about the people that when you threaten the the the norm and you threaten the hierarchy

462
00:37:52.04 --> 00:37:55.52
You threaten the things that provide them with their security

463
00:37:55.64 --> 00:38:00.28
Which is rigid discipline when you threaten those things they get mad and they attack yeah, they get mad

464
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.76
that

465
00:38:02.76 --> 00:38:09.04
You started this whole part and you used a word and I think you pulled it from the book twice and then I think you said it once and I wrote it down

466
00:38:09.04 --> 00:38:17.32
It was all this is a feature of the system like all this is a feature and he I think he was using it initially in this part of

467
00:38:17.32 --> 00:38:22.68
And if I'm just trying to paraphrase more what you said was hey

468
00:38:23.32 --> 00:38:25.72
Listen, you know the bell curve is kind of exists everywhere

469
00:38:25.72 --> 00:38:29.80
But there is something a little unique about those that sort of make it to this level of

470
00:38:30.44 --> 00:38:33.52
Senior leadership we're talking about generals and animals or you know lowerage or whatever

471
00:38:33.72 --> 00:38:37.60
But there's something a little different about the ones that make it up to that level and

472
00:38:38.32 --> 00:38:43.96
How it isn't quite just the same bell curve of everybody else where you got some smart people some you know middle-the-road folks

473
00:38:43.96 --> 00:38:46.76
Maybe some other folks and what I've been trying to

474
00:38:47.80 --> 00:38:53.28
Think in my mind about what that is is is kind of what you described is what's unique about those people those people

475
00:38:53.28 --> 00:38:59.12
Have figured out how to navigate the system this thing that we're all living in because when you join the military

476
00:38:59.12 --> 00:39:05.44
I don't count smart you are dumb you I don't care who or what you are what rank what service or where you came from at the beginning

477
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:10.40
You're just trying to figure out how the system works and if you figure out go oh

478
00:39:10.40 --> 00:39:13.44
This class that I'm in that job was in charge of

479
00:39:14.60 --> 00:39:19.16
At the end I get my choice of assignment strictly based on my GPA. Oh

480
00:39:20.12 --> 00:39:23.76
Okay, get you know guess what a lot of folks you're gonna do that figure that out

481
00:39:23.76 --> 00:39:26.08
I'm gonna get mom's gonna worry about the great oh

482
00:39:26.48 --> 00:39:31.88
Jocos got this thing for drill. It's this thing cool and so when you say hey we're gonna go drill

483
00:39:31.88 --> 00:39:32.88
Bill yeah

484
00:39:32.88 --> 00:39:37.32
Let's go do some more drill or hey Dave you got some free time. What do you want to do? I I think hey boss

485
00:39:37.32 --> 00:39:44.000
You know what we should do we should go drill and all of a sudden I kind of start maneuvering my way through the system to appeal to what I know is what you want

486
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.04
And I kind of wrote down some of the words of of things that are appealing brute force is appealing

487
00:39:50.16 --> 00:39:54.72
It's a peel and sounds cool. You know what doesn't sound cool deception

488
00:39:55.48 --> 00:40:00.26
Like I'm gonna I'm gonna take it indirect approach that that doesn't sound cool

489
00:40:00.26 --> 00:40:07.38
Um caring about people doesn't sound cool being nice doesn't sound cool being an intellectual for the military

490
00:40:07.38 --> 00:40:09.62
No that you know blowing things up sounds cool

491
00:40:09.62 --> 00:40:12.66
Being an intellectual doesn and if I can figure out early on

492
00:40:12.98 --> 00:40:19.42
What is it gonna appeal to you whoever my bosses are that school is or the intent is or the system and that's a

493
00:40:19.42 --> 00:40:24.90
Request of this is about the bellkers different of the top because they figured out how to navigate the system

494
00:40:25.14 --> 00:40:29.18
What the system wants and what the system wants is whoever's in charge that thing that appeals to them

495
00:40:29.18 --> 00:40:31.18
Which is things like

496
00:40:32.70 --> 00:40:34.70
What would you rather have someone who?

497
00:40:36.30 --> 00:40:38.30
a pragmatic thinker who's willing to to

498
00:40:39.34 --> 00:40:42.74
Give up on its plan and go in a different direction or someone who never gives up

499
00:40:43.98 --> 00:40:48.04
You know like how many times is we talk are we to talk about the direct approach and

500
00:40:49.34 --> 00:40:53.30
Not forget the idea that that that sounds appealing

501
00:40:53.54 --> 00:40:58.78
It sounds right. I'm just gonna come at him and tell him the truth as to those

502
00:40:58.78 --> 00:41:01.90
I I'm gonna play the long game. I'm gonna thanks strategically

503
00:41:01.90 --> 00:41:05.38
I'm gonna keep my ego in check. I'm gonna consider that I might be wrong and I'm gonna

504
00:41:05.82 --> 00:41:11.34
Moose slowly in this direction until we come to a the logical conclusion or I'm just gonna attack this target and run it over

505
00:41:11.90 --> 00:41:16.38
And the ones that figure out the system and have a navigate that it makes sense

506
00:41:16.90 --> 00:41:18.90
That at the top

507
00:41:18.90 --> 00:41:24.34
They actually use a different bell curve of people than those of us at the beginning who actually some of us

508
00:41:24.34 --> 00:41:26.98
Don't figure out how to navigate that system. Yeah. Yeah, and well

509
00:41:26.98 --> 00:41:29.94
I don't know if I necessarily fully agree with you

510
00:41:31.06 --> 00:41:33.06
because

511
00:41:33.06 --> 00:41:35.06
I think that the system

512
00:41:35.38 --> 00:41:40.78
the system but you're gonna agree with me. I said this anyways, but look at that that system

513
00:41:40.78 --> 00:41:43.66
There's people that that learn how to figure out the system

514
00:41:44.18 --> 00:41:48.62
Because they lack the ability to actually transit through the system on their own merit right?

515
00:41:48.62 --> 00:41:52.26
So that's one group of people. There's another group of people that

516
00:41:52.26 --> 00:41:58.18
Travel transit through the system and promote through the system because they're good and as we mentioned at the beginning

517
00:41:58.18 --> 00:42:01.82
This you and I both worked for incredible officers at all levels

518
00:42:02.50 --> 00:42:06.22
Incredible senior enlisted at all levels and some of those

519
00:42:06.90 --> 00:42:11.10
The people that were awesome. They made it through the system the system worked

520
00:42:11.10 --> 00:42:14.90
They didn't have to they didn't have to play a game. They have to manipulate

521
00:42:14.98 --> 00:42:19.74
They did what they knew they should do and they went up through the system and they were great

522
00:42:19.74 --> 00:42:23.42
But there's another group of people that's a group of people you're talking about that

523
00:42:23.94 --> 00:42:28.34
They don't have the capability but they figure out you know at Adam McGuire

524
00:42:28.82 --> 00:42:31.22
We were talking one day and he said

525
00:42:32.02 --> 00:42:34.82
He said you know if we I think he had gone over to see some

526
00:42:35.34 --> 00:42:42.38
The seals secure or the bud students secure from hell week and he came back. I didn't go with him for whatever reason he came back. He says

527
00:42:42.38 --> 00:42:44.38
You know

528
00:42:44.38 --> 00:42:49.42
If Ellie how do we want proves one thing like you're you're you're pretty tough

529
00:42:50.58 --> 00:42:55.62
You know because he sees these guys after six days of freaking you know being awake and doing physical stuff

530
00:42:55.62 --> 00:42:58.38
You guys you have proofs one thing you're pretty tough and I actually said back to him

531
00:42:58.38 --> 00:43:01.42
I said you know there's a group of people that also

532
00:43:02.14 --> 00:43:06.74
Go go through hell week and make it through how weak and what it proves is that they figured out how to how to get through

533
00:43:07.30 --> 00:43:10.02
Because there's things you can do in hell week and

534
00:43:10.02 --> 00:43:13.86
And it's it's actually a little different now when I went through hell week

535
00:43:15.06 --> 00:43:19.42
You you just if you didn't carry the head if you didn't put your head under the freaking boat

536
00:43:19.42 --> 00:43:21.42
I know this doesn't sound like that big of a deal

537
00:43:21.42 --> 00:43:26.22
But you carry these freaking boats on your head for a week straight and guys permanently lose

538
00:43:26.66 --> 00:43:31.38
Some guys not all guys some guys permanently lose their hair on the top of their head

539
00:43:31.86 --> 00:43:36.62
Because it gets so that freaking boat is just grinding on it and

540
00:43:36.62 --> 00:43:41.74
And it's it hurts hurt your neck hurt your head you have freaking scabs on the top of your head

541
00:43:41.74 --> 00:43:42.74
Whatever

542
00:43:42.74 --> 00:43:47.46
But there's some guys that figure out how to now you can't just take your head off the boat

543
00:43:48.38 --> 00:43:51.58
But you also you know maybe you don't quite

544
00:43:52.42 --> 00:43:54.10
Put as much into it

545
00:43:54.10 --> 00:43:56.10
There's guys that figure out

546
00:43:56.10 --> 00:43:59.86
You know when you're carrying the boat at a low ready, which is just carrying it your side

547
00:43:59.86 --> 00:44:05.10
Which again doesn't seem like a big deal until they fill it with sand and water and also it's you know half your back and

548
00:44:05.10 --> 00:44:11.78
So so you can kind of slack off a little bit and so there's guys that figure out

549
00:44:12.90 --> 00:44:15.90
Where to come in on a run where they're gonna get the least amount of attention?

550
00:44:15.90 --> 00:44:19.70
They figure out where to be in the chow haul line where no one's gonna pay any attention to them

551
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:26.34
They they they figure out how to get through and and I would say how weak is probably a pretty small amount of those people

552
00:44:26.62 --> 00:44:27.62
But

553
00:44:27.62 --> 00:44:33.42
You certainly would see a couple guys and you'd go man. How does he look fresh right now?

554
00:44:33.42 --> 00:44:37.58
Well rest is so I'm gonna as you look oh that guy's fresh because he's a badass

555
00:44:37.58 --> 00:44:42.14
So I'm gonna as you'd be thinking how's that dude look fresh right now? What just happened?

556
00:44:42.58 --> 00:44:46.94
So yeah in any system there's gonna be a way to

557
00:44:47.70 --> 00:44:52.88
Manoeuvre and manipulate through the system where if you don't have the chops to actually get it done

558
00:44:52.88 --> 00:44:58.58
You can still get there and yeah, obviously I do agree with that and I think that's why there is a

559
00:44:59.02 --> 00:45:01.26
little bit more of a contrast at the top

560
00:45:01.26 --> 00:45:03.26
Then there might be elsewhere

561
00:45:03.62 --> 00:45:07.86
When you're looking at the types the different types of people and the contrast to his point

562
00:45:08.22 --> 00:45:17.06
Usually doesn't reveal itself until you get to this and he illustrates all these catastrophic things and you're looking back and thinking how could someone be in that position?

563
00:45:17.62 --> 00:45:21.60
Do the things that they're doing and that's really I think what you're describing is

564
00:45:22.02 --> 00:45:28.02
There's two different types of people that can get to that place now the ones that are doing it like you said on their merits

565
00:45:28.02 --> 00:45:33.82
They still have to be doing a good job you can't not not having maneuver in the system and be terrible at what you're doing

566
00:45:34.18 --> 00:45:39.98
But you can find your way to kind of maneuver up that ladder maneuver inside of that system and

567
00:45:42.98 --> 00:45:47.22
Be in that category of people that sometimes will go oh well he's he's a general he must be awesome

568
00:45:48.26 --> 00:45:52.66
This is how this person got there, but you you won't see that

569
00:45:52.66 --> 00:46:01.02
It won't be revealed as to what this person is until it's in he's in one of those situations and I think that contrast that he's a looting to is like it's a little bit different there

570
00:46:01.74 --> 00:46:05.02
Is more stark because at the at the very beginning

571
00:46:05.58 --> 00:46:12.18
None of us have figured either of those things out yet. We're still figuring out hey, what do we need to do and how does the system work and the I

572
00:46:13.06 --> 00:46:20.66
You should blend the two I want to work inside the system. I want to buck against the system and be so resistant to the system that the system gets rid of me

573
00:46:20.66 --> 00:46:22.50
Yo, I was about to say what about those

574
00:46:22.94 --> 00:46:27.50
Leaders that are incredible leaders that are dynamic that have these great personalities. They have good tactical science

575
00:46:27.50 --> 00:46:31.94
But they can't play the game at all. I can't play the game at all right, and now they'd never get promoted

576
00:46:31.94 --> 00:46:37.22
And they have no influence. That's right. I'm gonna tell me hackworth didn't play the hackworth played the freaking game for a long time

577
00:46:37.22 --> 00:46:38.42
Played the game like

578
00:46:38.42 --> 00:46:39.62
Massively

579
00:46:39.62 --> 00:46:44.58
Massively and he loved it. He wasn't even playing the game. He was in the game. He was the he was the freaking player

580
00:46:45.14 --> 00:46:50.24
And he's an example of a guy that he played the system. He got those jobs

581
00:46:50.24 --> 00:46:57.88
He did those things, but he also was highly skilled as a leader. Yes, and there's plenty of people that would have done

582
00:46:57.88 --> 00:47:01.80
And there's plenty of people that did the exact same thing as hackworth

583
00:47:02.24 --> 00:47:07.80
Minus the leadership capability. There was a hard job. What would you call hard fill billet right? Yeah in the sealed things

584
00:47:07.80 --> 00:47:11.44
We had the same thing you got a hard fill billet somewhere after you do your hard fill billet

585
00:47:11.44 --> 00:47:14.000
They literally will give you any job you want. Well cool

586
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.20
Hey

587
00:47:15.20 --> 00:47:18.40
I'm not gonna promote it on that, but I'm just gonna jump on that hard fill billet

588
00:47:18.40 --> 00:47:22.36
Get done with that. They send you overseas on the company for two years

589
00:47:22.60 --> 00:47:25.96
Boom and you come back now. There's some guys that do that

590
00:47:26.44 --> 00:47:30.76
Because they're freaking good team players. They're you know what? I don't want someone else to have to do this

591
00:47:30.76 --> 00:47:32.96
You know what my my kids just left for college

592
00:47:32.96 --> 00:47:36.32
I'm gonna be I don't have anything to worry about for two years boom

593
00:47:36.32 --> 00:47:41.44
I'm gonna go take this hard fill billet take one for the team. There's some people that do it for that reason totally

594
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:48.08
There's some people do it because they're going I can get promoted next after this so let's check in the box and that piece when you talk about the leadership

595
00:47:48.08 --> 00:47:53.20
All I'm thinking is he actually cares about the people. Yeah, he actually cares about the people around him

596
00:47:53.20 --> 00:47:57.04
And so that maneuver to gain the influence is

597
00:47:59.04 --> 00:48:03.60
Is by design to be able to help people yeah because you know there's peace

598
00:48:03.60 --> 00:48:09.80
There's features in the system. He's got to protect them from yes. It's it's all about the intent. Yes, and although

599
00:48:11.08 --> 00:48:15.84
You can smell intent the system has a much harder time smelling intent

600
00:48:15.84 --> 00:48:22.36
A system has a much harder time smelling intent look they look at Dave Burke and they look at Jaco and they both went overseas

601
00:48:22.36 --> 00:48:24.36
Took a hard fill billet

602
00:48:24.36 --> 00:48:28.000
Jaco was doing it because he wanted to get promoted Dave was doing it because he had

603
00:48:28.52 --> 00:48:32.72
You know his kids had just left for for a college and so he felt like it was a good time

604
00:48:32.72 --> 00:48:36.20
And he could take the strain off of someone else that might as calf kids so at all

605
00:48:36.36 --> 00:48:39.72
Yeah, but what did they see on the paper? They don't see any of that. They can't see that intent

606
00:48:39.88 --> 00:48:45.000
They can't see it. They've they knew us they could smell it. Yeah, but they don't get close enough on the promotion board

607
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Some people around you know

608
00:48:49.48 --> 00:48:56.52
Fast forward a little bit general Robert E. Lee admitted that the greatest mistake of my life was taking a military education

609
00:48:57.72 --> 00:49:05.60
And general still well said it is common knowledge that an army officer has a one track mind that he is personally interested in stirring up wars

610
00:49:05.60 --> 00:49:12.72
So that he can get a promotion and be decorated and that he has an extraordinarily limited education with no appreciation of the finer things in life

611
00:49:12.72 --> 00:49:18.48
That's a heavy statement again. Are there some guys like that? Absolutely. That's not the majority for sure

612
00:49:19.24 --> 00:49:26.000
Fast forward a little bit more the saddest feature of anti intellectualism is that it often reflects an actual

613
00:49:26.20 --> 00:49:30.20
suppression of the intellectual activity rather than any lack of ability

614
00:49:31.20 --> 00:49:39.20
This is suggested by the rapidity with which so many military men rush into print as soon as they ever retired

615
00:49:39.20 --> 00:49:41.20
This talking about people right in books

616
00:49:41.20 --> 00:49:45.76
Evidently there was something waiting to get out

617
00:49:47.20 --> 00:49:52.60
Unfortunately as Lidel heart points out a lifetime of having to curb the expression of original thought

618
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:57.000
culminates so often in there being nothing left to express

619
00:49:57.92 --> 00:50:01.56
So this is talking about I mean this guy is right in the spoken 1976

620
00:50:01.56 --> 00:50:05.60
So he's talking about guys world world world world world war two as soon as they get out of the military they write these books

621
00:50:06.32 --> 00:50:08.32
a guy like BHL heart

622
00:50:08.32 --> 00:50:14.32
He writes books because he had all this stuff pen up and he also got out early because he had so much stuff

623
00:50:14.32 --> 00:50:15.96
Pen out pen up inside of his head

624
00:50:15.96 --> 00:50:20.68
This guy's in a lot of times by the time they get out. There's no freaking creative thought left. There's no new ideas left

625
00:50:22.84 --> 00:50:31.84
Research on the relationship between mental activity and cerebral blood blood flow adds to point that the old belief that the brain like muscle

626
00:50:31.84 --> 00:50:38.92
Attrophies from prolonged disuse but perhaps this touches upon the real cause of military incompetence age

627
00:50:39.68 --> 00:50:47.80
Since traditionally promotion is dependent upon seniority commanders generals and above have tended to be old and since thinking

628
00:50:48.44 --> 00:50:51.20
Memory intelligence and special senses all deteriorate with age

629
00:50:51.32 --> 00:50:58.04
Then maybe bad generals are just old generals again. He's making an argument. Well, maybe these guys are just old. Maybe that's our problem

630
00:50:58.04 --> 00:51:05.56
Another contribution to the incompetence tied up with age was the unhelpful tendency to

631
00:51:05.84 --> 00:51:06.80
Sack

632
00:51:06.80 --> 00:51:16.44
Fortunately retire or otherwise curtail the promotion of those young officers who unwisely failed to conceal their their lights

633
00:51:16.44 --> 00:51:19.44
But-neath bushels of conformity

634
00:51:19.44 --> 00:51:27.52
So real quick on the getting old part this is something that I was I think I talked about it on on the academy

635
00:51:28.64 --> 00:51:33.02
I heard that interview with Cass Baroff the chess player and

636
00:51:34.56 --> 00:51:41.12
Interview or acts actually I think it was Lex Friedman Lex asked him maybe it was Lex I think Lex asked him

637
00:51:41.44 --> 00:51:47.12
Not in a direct way, but basically could you beat Magnus Carlson who's right now like this phenom and

638
00:51:47.12 --> 00:51:55.66
And Cass Baroff said no and of the part of the answer which is what I talked about on the academy was part of their reason is because

639
00:51:58.04 --> 00:52:00.72
Magnus has got to see everything that

640
00:52:01.12 --> 00:52:05.06
Cost bar off done and study him. It's like a jitter guys now. They're like you know you got to

641
00:52:05.60 --> 00:52:09.60
You took you seven years to figure out the 50 50 position

642
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:12.80
I got to learn that in 20 minutes on YouTube, right?

643
00:52:12.80 --> 00:52:19.76
So I can start building off that immediately and that's the same thing with Cass Baroff is that is that Magnus Carlson has seen all of his moves

644
00:52:19.76 --> 00:52:21.80
And everyone else's moves and studied him in books

645
00:52:21.80 --> 00:52:23.80
So he's already building off of taller platform

646
00:52:24.08 --> 00:52:28.72
But also Cass Baroff said I think Cass Baroff was like 55 60 something like this

647
00:52:28.72 --> 00:52:31.44
Maybe let me know a little bit over he's like yeah, well, I'm older now

648
00:52:31.44 --> 00:52:33.92
Yeah, and that brain ain't working as good

649
00:52:33.92 --> 00:52:40.36
So that which really surprised me because I didn't understand that I thought hey you get older you get smarter and

650
00:52:40.36 --> 00:52:43.76
And once you reach a certain point now you're heading in the other direction

651
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.32
So that's what he's bringing up and he said hey could that be his part of it?

652
00:52:48.84 --> 00:52:50.84
Um

653
00:52:51.16 --> 00:52:57.64
He says such was the case of major general JFC Fuller on December 13th, 1933

654
00:52:57.64 --> 00:53:01.32
Fuller one of the most intellectually gifted man ever to serve in the British army

655
00:53:01.72 --> 00:53:09.52
Was placed on the retired list this waste of talent resulted from the prejudice aroused by his fully borne out prophecies

656
00:53:09.52 --> 00:53:13.20
And the fact that he adhered to criticize those less gifted than him

657
00:53:14.20 --> 00:53:18.40
Now let's think about that we could be mad at the military for kicking him out

658
00:53:18.40 --> 00:53:19.68
But guess what he didn't do

659
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.40
He didn't play the games also criticizing people is probably telling them that they're dumb. Yeah, yeah

660
00:53:24.40 --> 00:53:28.08
He didn't play the game properly. So if you would have played the game a little bit and

661
00:53:28.48 --> 00:53:30.56
Not been a prophet as be a slow-dell heart

662
00:53:30.56 --> 00:53:36.76
Said instead been a leader maybe he could have slowly got some senior officer to understand it make it his ID and all of a sudden

663
00:53:36.76 --> 00:53:41.40
His ideas are getting pushed forward by this in your audience said he gets put on the freaking retired list yeah

664
00:53:42.04 --> 00:53:47.80
And this this thing that you've you've mentioned the past pint isn't exactly a fit here

665
00:53:47.80 --> 00:53:51.12
But that idea of have you're so smart why aren't you winning?

666
00:53:51.76 --> 00:53:55.000
You know like well for a freaking great quote just yeah

667
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.28
This is my tip of if you're smart as you think you are why can't you figure out?

668
00:54:00.28 --> 00:54:01.88
I'm a newver through this this

669
00:54:01.88 --> 00:54:07.88
Labyrinth of chaos. Yeah, you know which by the way if you're so smart how hard how hard could it be you haven't figured this out yet

670
00:54:07.88 --> 00:54:10.12
Right you haven't figured this out yet that

671
00:54:10.12 --> 00:54:16.36
Question which I originally asked myself when I was like an e4 in the sealed teams when I wasn't getting promoted and other guys were

672
00:54:16.76 --> 00:54:22.04
Was hey wait a second if you're so smart freaking their Rambo why aren't you getting per why aren't you winning?

673
00:54:22.04 --> 00:54:27.48
What's wrong with you? Yeah, you idiot, but that's one of my favorite questions to ask people

674
00:54:27.48 --> 00:54:35.40
Hey, because they'll be telling me this and this and this and this and this complaint this other complaint and how this is messed up and the other things messed up

675
00:54:35.40 --> 00:54:40.84
And it's like if you if you are so smart if you're so freaking smart why aren't you just maneuver through this system?

676
00:54:40.84 --> 00:54:42.84
Yeah, what's wrong with you

677
00:54:44.84 --> 00:54:46.84
And by the way

678
00:54:47.40 --> 00:54:52.64
Fuller like they were gonna bring him back in and they offered him something and other guys

679
00:54:52.64 --> 00:54:58.40
I mean, he's just like made it made it too hard on himself, man. Smard us what did this?

680
00:54:58.40 --> 00:55:02.16
What did you say? One of the most intellectually gifted men ever deserved in the British Army

681
00:55:04.24 --> 00:55:07.92
But he wasn't quite winning was he because he got freaking put on the retired list

682
00:55:09.12 --> 00:55:13.28
And look maybe there was some situation where they were asking him to do you know hey

683
00:55:13.28 --> 00:55:17.12
We don't want to see another people like but even if that happens what do you do you say okay?

684
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:24.000
Go how can I refraise this how can I adjust my message what people can I make allies if you're so freaking smart then go win

685
00:55:26.88 --> 00:55:34.16
Fast 40 yet yet another way in which age determines in competence is through the voluntary resignation of intelligent young officers

686
00:55:34.72 --> 00:55:41.28
According to Janowicz a study of US Army lieutenant suggests that the brighter ones resigned as soon as they have completed their obliquity

687
00:55:41.28 --> 00:55:45.92
Obliquity service while those less well equipped remain

688
00:55:47.44 --> 00:55:54.24
That's again, is that all across the board? Absolutely not and there's freaking incredible officers that are smarter than any civilian out there

689
00:55:54.24 --> 00:55:58.16
That's staying the military and they do 20 30 40 years for sure

690
00:55:59.92 --> 00:56:01.92
And there's also guys that are going

691
00:56:02.80 --> 00:56:07.92
You know I got my paycheck coming in every two weeks kind of regard this of what I do

692
00:56:07.92 --> 00:56:14.000
Mama stick it out and there's a little joke in the military too that that at each love of you you move up. It's

693
00:56:15.20 --> 00:56:18.96
That there's some some truths to it which is hey you got promoted. Yeah, all the good guys got out

694
00:56:19.52 --> 00:56:23.76
Yeah, that's why I got promoted. Yeah, hey, hey Dave you made major. Yeah, all the best captains

695
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.72
Let left so then we're going to enjoy so the joke about bad is you know some truth

696
00:56:28.72 --> 00:56:33.84
There's absolutely some truth of oh I'm glad these two guys bailed because I would have been competing with them

697
00:56:33.84 --> 00:56:38.88
And I don't know if I would have made the cut if they stuck around yeah, but they're left with me so I'm going to I'm going to get that promotion

698
00:56:38.88 --> 00:56:44.64
Yeah, there's absolutely some level of truth to that yeah someone that looks around the military

699
00:56:44.72 --> 00:56:46.72
You know one of the one of the things that made me

700
00:56:48.48 --> 00:56:55.76
One of the one of the things that had a little bit of an influence on my decision to retire was it's a communist

701
00:56:56.56 --> 00:56:59.36
Environment right it's a communist environment you

702
00:56:59.36 --> 00:57:05.28
You you're getting the same promotion rate. I mean what did you get advanced early a couple times?

703
00:57:05.84 --> 00:57:07.60
No, no really promotions to Marine Corps

704
00:57:08.88 --> 00:57:13.28
So that that that says that's there is right so it doesn't matter what you do

705
00:57:13.60 --> 00:57:21.92
So you were you were an F-18 pilot you were top gunners, are you all these things and how how much faster do you advance than did someone that was uh, you know

706
00:57:21.92 --> 00:57:23.92
Running whatever

707
00:57:23.92 --> 00:57:26.40
Freaking supplied in the middle of nowhere

708
00:57:26.40 --> 00:57:31.68
What how much early did you get advanced zero days zero days zero days?

709
00:57:32.64 --> 00:57:34.32
So I got

710
00:57:34.32 --> 00:57:39.92
Advanced early one time which is which was like I only know of one other person

711
00:57:40.64 --> 00:57:45.76
I don't know one person that got promoted early twice. There's probably more but one of the I know one of the person

712
00:57:45.76 --> 00:57:49.84
It got advanced early. He got advanced early twice and that's dealt it Charlie by the way

713
00:57:50.56 --> 00:57:53.28
Delta Charlie talk about play the game DC

714
00:57:54.32 --> 00:57:56.32
He was maneuver

715
00:57:56.32 --> 00:58:02.88
And awesome, but so so I'm looking around and look was either best guy. Absolutely not

716
00:58:03.28 --> 00:58:05.28
But I looked around some guys I said wait a second

717
00:58:06.80 --> 00:58:11.68
Of all the stuff I've done I've been going on back to back to deployments doing whatever I can do

718
00:58:12.24 --> 00:58:14.24
doing a good job

719
00:58:14.24 --> 00:58:16.24
In combat doing a good job

720
00:58:16.24 --> 00:58:20.08
Just doing just doing a good job right look I wasn't the best but I wasn't doing bad

721
00:58:20.40 --> 00:58:22.40
But then I had look at some other knucklehead

722
00:58:22.40 --> 00:58:29.60
That was actually doing bad who had a bad reputation, you know some knucklehead that you know wasn't even in the game

723
00:58:30.48 --> 00:58:34.88
And guess what these getting promoted? Oh, I got promoted one year ahead of that way and by the way

724
00:58:34.88 --> 00:58:38.88
I'll bunch of other great guys that I knew are getting promoted the same time at him. I was like man

725
00:58:39.36 --> 00:58:41.36
That is freaking not right

726
00:58:41.52 --> 00:58:45.52
It wasn't as much of a meritocracy as it should have been and that bummed me out

727
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:52.08
It bummed me out because I was looking at probably another seven years before I would have been in charge of something again

728
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:56.88
Which is a long time to be waiting to get in charge. We chuckle that out over there. I quit Charleston

729
00:58:57.52 --> 00:59:02.000
Every time you see that bummed me out first and reason that's always funny to me

730
00:59:02.56 --> 00:59:05.36
Yeah, yeah, it did though it bummed me out

731
00:59:06.56 --> 00:59:07.92
Sorry

732
00:59:07.92 --> 00:59:12.40
This thing's not bummed you out. They do but that expression is funny especially when you say

733
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:14.40
Yeah

734
00:59:13.92 --> 00:59:15.20
Check

735
00:59:15.44 --> 00:59:21.76
It's a little bit of a communist system. It's a little bit of a socialist system where if you stay in and you check the boxes

736
00:59:22.16 --> 00:59:24.16
Whether you check those boxes with freaking

737
00:59:25.12 --> 00:59:30.88
Big giant checks or you check them with a little nickmark. It doesn't matter you check it you're good

738
00:59:35.04 --> 00:59:40.64
Notwithstanding these considerations ages far from being a complete explanation of military incompetence for

739
00:59:40.64 --> 00:59:44.96
There have been plenty of old generals and some remarkably inept young ones

740
00:59:45.52 --> 00:59:51.04
Or sorry there's been plenty of able old generals and some remarkably inept young ones

741
00:59:51.04 --> 00:59:57.44
So he's saying look even though old people might have a hard time there's been freaking incredible generals that were super old and there's been young generals that were idiots

742
00:59:57.84 --> 01:00:03.36
So that argument doesn't really hold as it backs noted the generals of AD

743
01:00:03.36 --> 01:00:10.64
Generals who were sick of body and even in mind have one important victories. So there you go age

744
01:00:10.96 --> 01:00:18.24
You can't put all this stuff on age, but let us look at another aspect of what appears to be in intellectual incompetence the urge to pontificate

745
01:00:20.80 --> 01:00:29.68
In accordance with the principle that nature of horrors of vacuum ignorance tends to evoke pontification and those that wish to conceal their lack of knowledge

746
01:00:29.68 --> 01:00:37.84
Or for whom ignorance of the facts means that they feel free to express strongly held beliefs of a contrary nature

747
01:00:38.80 --> 01:00:42.08
This is an interesting one and it really if you

748
01:00:43.44 --> 01:00:47.04
You ever seen to movie the six cents. I know you have echo you seen it Dave have and

749
01:00:47.52 --> 01:00:50.24
You know when you get to the end you look back and you see all the things are obvious

750
01:00:50.24 --> 01:00:53.60
This one right here when I read this I was like oh man this is good

751
01:00:53.60 --> 01:00:59.36
You look back at your career and to think of all these people that like to pontificate and you think I knew that guy was maybe it

752
01:01:00.24 --> 01:01:03.36
Well, I got one shot up right wouldn't shot up

753
01:01:04.08 --> 01:01:10.32
Wait, what is pontificate talking talking carrying on talking especially things that you don't really know too much about

754
01:01:10.32 --> 01:01:15.52
It's also not a compliment like if somebody like what's like we're gonna the jacco and I'm like he likes to pontificate a lot

755
01:01:15.52 --> 01:01:17.92
That's not it that's not me saying he's a big thinker

756
01:01:17.92 --> 01:01:23.52
He's me like they do like to hear himself talk he weighs a lot of time thinking out loud and it's all at the end

757
01:01:23.52 --> 01:01:25.52
You look back like that's a complete waste of time

758
01:01:25.52 --> 01:01:29.84
So it's not a good thing. I'd say maybe you the expression hot air

759
01:01:30.56 --> 01:01:33.28
That guy's filled a lot of hot air. This is a nice way of saying

760
01:01:33.60 --> 01:01:36.96
That guy's full of water. Oh, it's not even a nice way of saying as Dave's doing out

761
01:01:37.04 --> 01:01:41.44
You don't say someone hey jacco did a great job pontificating at them at the master

762
01:01:41.44 --> 01:01:43.44
They were you and say that

763
01:01:43.44 --> 01:01:47.68
Some timing associated with it too. He wants a chime in like we need to go a step out and he's like hey

764
01:01:48.32 --> 01:01:54.000
And he wants to start talking and yeah, and we're forced to sit in and listen to him and it's not just what he's saying

765
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.64
It's also the time of which he's saying it. You're just thinking dude

766
01:01:57.36 --> 01:01:59.36
Okay, I guess we're gonna sit here and listen him talk

767
01:01:59.76 --> 01:02:05.76
Okay, I always thought it was like kind of thinking and talking but in a good way

768
01:02:05.76 --> 01:02:15.84
I thought it was like hey, let's get to the bottom of let's listen explore it, you know, but me okay, I get it now. Oh

769
01:02:16.24 --> 01:02:22.32
So with pontification in a calling where the accuracy of communication may be a matter of life or death

770
01:02:22.72 --> 01:02:28.16
The predispotent position to pontificate is a dangerous liability by the way

771
01:02:28.80 --> 01:02:31.52
We have something called the second law of combat leadership. It's simple

772
01:02:31.52 --> 01:02:35.92
The subtitle that is simple clear concise communication

773
01:02:36.08 --> 01:02:39.76
So pontification is the opposite of that oddly enough

774
01:02:41.12 --> 01:02:47.68
Unfortunately such a predisposition it will be the strong the will be strongest in those like head masters judges

775
01:02:47.92 --> 01:02:56.24
Prison governors and senior military commanders who for too long have been in a position to lord over their fellow men

776
01:02:56.24 --> 01:03:02.72
Unfortunately such a predisposition will also be strongest in authoritarian organizations

777
01:03:02.96 --> 01:03:07.92
Where the preservation of apparent omnitions by those above

778
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:11.36
Maybe deemed more important than the truth

779
01:03:12.48 --> 01:03:14.48
So this is that senior leader that

780
01:03:15.92 --> 01:03:20.96
Basically no one will tell them to be quiet and you know what's even worse than that

781
01:03:20.96 --> 01:03:26.48
People sit there with a big smile in their face nodding their heads cuz you know oh

782
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:31.92
Chocolate's talking oh yes boss that sounds great. Plus. Please tell us more. It's all a lie

783
01:03:32.48 --> 01:03:34.48
They're really thinking shut up dude

784
01:03:35.52 --> 01:03:39.52
That's what's going on yeah and some of those people are going oh

785
01:03:40.80 --> 01:03:44.80
If I ever get to that's this is how many get to that spot. I'm gonna do that

786
01:03:44.80 --> 01:03:51.36
What a follow like that's what I do that's that's how the system rewards me or I can't I can't navigate that system is

787
01:03:51.44 --> 01:03:52.72
I can do the same thing

788
01:03:52.72 --> 01:03:56.96
It's awesome. I can't wait to let me tell I already get people have to listen to this in me. I can't wait

789
01:03:58.32 --> 01:04:00.32
I know this

790
01:04:03.12 --> 01:04:08.40
Because we sit here and talk for hours of the time as our freaking job not only here, but in echelon front

791
01:04:08.40 --> 01:04:13.36
That's our actual job as to talk to people. I mean echelon front actually our job a lot is to listen as well

792
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:17.64
But you know people might get the impression that oh, you know

793
01:04:17.64 --> 01:04:22.48
Jocco it's like at the master when I'm guess what I'm on stage I'm talking that's what we're doing

794
01:04:23.52 --> 01:04:25.52
Come to an echelon front meeting

795
01:04:25.52 --> 01:04:32.12
You know see who he's talking like see how much I'm talking right it's come to a task in a bruiser meeting

796
01:04:32.28 --> 01:04:34.92
See how much I'm talking come to a

797
01:04:35.72 --> 01:04:38.68
Seal team seven echo put to in meeting when I was a student commander

798
01:04:38.68 --> 01:04:41.36
Am I the one that's talking all time absolutely not

799
01:04:41.36 --> 01:04:46.000
So although we talk a lot here. This is not the norm

800
01:04:48.32 --> 01:04:53.16
But the important thing about pontification is that though an intellectual exercise

801
01:04:54.08 --> 01:04:56.08
It's origins are emotional

802
01:04:58.08 --> 01:05:02.20
closely allied to pontification and no less hazardous is

803
01:05:03.36 --> 01:05:05.36
conditive dissidents

804
01:05:05.36 --> 01:05:11.000
Now it just just to just to talk about dissonance just the word

805
01:05:12.40 --> 01:05:14.40
It means

806
01:05:14.40 --> 01:05:18.72
Technically what it means is an in-harmonious sound that's technically what it means

807
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:21.72
It's it sounds that don't match together

808
01:05:21.92 --> 01:05:25.68
So like if you play piano there's certain there's certain keys of the piano

809
01:05:25.68 --> 01:05:28.36
You can hit at the same time and you are right guitar

810
01:05:28.36 --> 01:05:33.92
You can hit certain strings and certain you doesn't sound right that's because they don't match because they're in congruent

811
01:05:33.92 --> 01:05:37.44
They're in disagreement those noises are in disagreement

812
01:05:37.44 --> 01:05:42.56
So cognitive dissidents means that you have things in your head that don't agree

813
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:49.56
There's things in your head that don't agree and it's what people do and how people handle things in their head that

814
01:05:49.88 --> 01:05:52.24
Don't agree. This is the important part

815
01:05:52.64 --> 01:05:58.36
Because with any situation that you have there's gonna be different sides to every argument

816
01:05:58.36 --> 01:06:01.36
There's gonna be different sides to be if we're gonna go to a taqatarget

817
01:06:01.36 --> 01:06:04.74
Part of your brain should be saying like okay, this looks like something we can get done part of it to say

818
01:06:04.74 --> 01:06:09.64
Okay, there's looks like there's a rata risks as well you got two different things in your head two different

819
01:06:10.36 --> 01:06:14.32
In congruent thoughts in your head they they're not the same

820
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:19.12
So so cognitive dissidents means I have two things in my head that don't match

821
01:06:20.16 --> 01:06:23.04
How do you handle it that's the question how do you handle it?

822
01:06:24.64 --> 01:06:28.36
This uncomfortable mental state arises when a person possesses knowledgeable beliefs

823
01:06:28.36 --> 01:06:33.12
Which conflict with a decision he is made so that's going even one step further. I've made a decision

824
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:36.40
And now I'm getting some different information

825
01:06:37.40 --> 01:06:41.20
The following hypothetical situation should make the matter plain a heavy smoker

826
01:06:41.92 --> 01:06:47.82
Experiences dissidents because the knowledge that he smokes is inconsistent with the

827
01:06:48.48 --> 01:06:54.70
Knowledge that smoking causes cancer since he finds it impossible to give up cigarettes. He tries to reduce

828
01:06:54.92 --> 01:06:56.92
dissidents

829
01:06:56.92 --> 01:07:00.68
By concentrating on justifications for smoking and ignoring

830
01:07:01.36 --> 01:07:06.12
Evidence for its risks. He may tell himself that the revenue from tobacco helps the government

831
01:07:06.12 --> 01:07:08.88
That it keeps his weight down and then it is a manly

832
01:07:09.16 --> 01:07:15.52
sociable habit at the same time. He may well refrain from reading the latest report on the relationship between

833
01:07:15.80 --> 01:07:20.88
Smoking and lung cancer if on the other hand he cannot avoid being confronted by tiresome statistics

834
01:07:20.88 --> 01:07:27.44
He may well strive to reduce dissidents by telling himself and others that the correlation between smoking and cancer could

835
01:07:27.44 --> 01:07:33.36
Just as well be taken to signify that people who are going to get cancer anyway tend to smoke in order to ward off the disease

836
01:07:34.56 --> 01:07:40.40
So you're just telling yourself lies to try to try and even out that disagreement in your own head

837
01:07:41.44 --> 01:07:42.96
Since it was first

838
01:07:42.96 --> 01:07:51.000
Propounded by a festinger in 1957 dissonance theory has given rise to a large number of empirical studies

839
01:07:51.44 --> 01:07:57.02
Through the though the precise nature of the underlying psychological processes as far from clear

840
01:07:57.02 --> 01:08:02.72
There are certain conclusions which could have serious implications for military decision making

841
01:08:02.96 --> 01:08:11.08
They may be summarized by saying that quote once the decision has been made and the person is committed to a given course of action

842
01:08:11.08 --> 01:08:14.44
The psychological situation changes decisively

843
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:22.08
There is less emphasis on objectivity and there is more partiality and bias in the way in which the person

844
01:08:22.60 --> 01:08:25.44
views and evaluates the alternatives and

845
01:08:25.84 --> 01:08:34.90
quote in other words decision making may well be followed by a period of mental activity that could be described as at the very least

846
01:08:35.24 --> 01:08:37.24
Some what one cited

847
01:08:37.24 --> 01:08:48.44
Yeah, dude you I would he like I got halfway into that sentence and you were just shaking your head because you know you seen this happen totally and he you know

848
01:08:48.44 --> 01:08:50.84
He you did that list earlier and I the one that was

849
01:08:51.40 --> 01:08:55.88
Coming back to as you're talking about in the hard part about as you can you can I know what you're gonna say before

850
01:08:55.88 --> 01:08:59.40
He's saying and now you know what's coming when he's describing this is here's the plan

851
01:08:59.72 --> 01:09:04.38
Jocco's down in the front sends me a report. Go hey boss things are mess things are messed down here

852
01:09:04.38 --> 01:09:05.38
I'm like

853
01:09:05.38 --> 01:09:07.56
No, they're not that better, we're fine

854
01:09:07.56 --> 01:09:11.50
We need it. We're just gonna keep doing this or like hey listen it's got much worse and

855
01:09:14.80 --> 01:09:17.90
Rationalization all those words, but the the

856
01:09:18.64 --> 01:09:24.72
willingness to just ignore the truth because it is inconvenient with the conclusion I've already drawn and how quick let I can go

857
01:09:25.92 --> 01:09:30.60
You know what his feedback is you know It's based on what he's seeing

858
01:09:30.60 --> 01:09:34.18
It's not really he doesn't know it's going on it's that other big picture so we're just gonna keep it

859
01:09:34.18 --> 01:09:35.66
plus chocolate's kind of emotional.

860
01:09:35.66 --> 01:09:38.42
Plus he's, you know, it just started.

861
01:09:38.42 --> 01:09:39.66
He has now that much combat experience.

862
01:09:39.66 --> 01:09:41.42
He's getting shot at, yeah, she's freaking out.

863
01:09:41.42 --> 01:09:42.90
But this is, he doesn't see where I'm trying to get.

864
01:09:42.90 --> 01:09:44.70
I mean, you just rationalize that shit all day long.

865
01:09:44.70 --> 01:09:45.54
All day.

866
01:09:46.54 --> 01:09:49.14
You know, here's another thing you were talking about.

867
01:09:50.58 --> 01:09:51.58
Like, what is it?

868
01:09:51.58 --> 01:09:53.34
What is the cool military leader?

869
01:09:53.34 --> 01:09:54.78
What do we think of, here's one.

870
01:09:57.98 --> 01:10:00.46
Would you say, I want to promote this guy

871
01:10:00.46 --> 01:10:03.86
who has a lot of self doubt, right?

872
01:10:03.86 --> 01:10:04.70
Are you?

873
01:10:04.70 --> 01:10:05.54
We're not promoting that guy.

874
01:10:05.54 --> 01:10:09.14
But what's interesting is I am so filled with self doubt

875
01:10:09.14 --> 01:10:12.30
that when I come up with a plan and Dave Burke sends a report

876
01:10:12.30 --> 01:10:13.78
back from the front line is like, hey, Jock,

877
01:10:13.78 --> 01:10:14.50
we got heavy reasons here.

878
01:10:14.50 --> 01:10:15.98
I'm like, okay, I must have been wrong.

879
01:10:15.98 --> 01:10:16.82
I'm sorry.

880
01:10:16.82 --> 01:10:18.30
I'm missing something.

881
01:10:18.30 --> 01:10:20.18
Does this mean I'm not gonna freaking push forward?

882
01:10:20.18 --> 01:10:21.02
No, it doesn't mean that.

883
01:10:21.02 --> 01:10:23.62
But it means I'm actually doing the opposite of this,

884
01:10:23.62 --> 01:10:25.90
trying to balance out the dissidents.

885
01:10:25.90 --> 01:10:29.22
I'm paying more attention because I think I might be wrong.

886
01:10:30.34 --> 01:10:33.22
The irony in that truth, the irony is

887
01:10:33.22 --> 01:10:36.18
is how you've described you having a reputation

888
01:10:36.18 --> 01:10:39.34
of being so decisive in your time and the teams

889
01:10:39.34 --> 01:10:42.54
was based on that belief that you could be wrong,

890
01:10:42.54 --> 01:10:44.86
which is why you've made these incremental decisions.

891
01:10:44.86 --> 01:10:47.02
It didn't or commit to the end.

892
01:10:47.02 --> 01:10:49.34
Was actually driven by what you just described.

893
01:10:49.34 --> 01:10:51.74
It's, you know, the term self doubt

894
01:10:51.74 --> 01:10:54.66
doesn't have like this positive connotation,

895
01:10:54.66 --> 01:10:57.66
but it's like, oh, hey, I bet you're this bunch of things

896
01:10:57.66 --> 01:10:58.50
I don't know.

897
01:10:58.50 --> 01:10:59.90
So you know what I shouldn't do over commit.

898
01:10:59.90 --> 01:11:04.90
Which was based on you having a reputation of being decisive

899
01:11:05.46 --> 01:11:10.14
which people can equate to the opposite of self doubt.

900
01:11:10.14 --> 01:11:13.38
I'm so secure in my decision making process

901
01:11:13.38 --> 01:11:15.06
that I know the outcome and this is the course

902
01:11:15.06 --> 01:11:15.90
that we're going on.

903
01:11:15.90 --> 01:11:17.30
It's exactly opposite of what you're doing,

904
01:11:17.30 --> 01:11:18.90
which is the incremental piece and go,

905
01:11:18.90 --> 01:11:19.82
hey, I got some feedback.

906
01:11:19.82 --> 01:11:21.54
Yeah, boss, here's some feedback.

907
01:11:21.54 --> 01:11:23.26
This was this blew up in our face.

908
01:11:23.26 --> 01:11:24.62
We ran into a brick wall.

909
01:11:24.62 --> 01:11:27.30
Three vehicles are down and we can't keep going.

910
01:11:27.30 --> 01:11:29.86
And you're gonna go, oh, we need to do something

911
01:11:29.86 --> 01:11:32.46
different right now as opposed to,

912
01:11:32.46 --> 01:11:34.10
hey, just keep going.

913
01:11:34.10 --> 01:11:35.90
We're sticking to the plan.

914
01:11:35.90 --> 01:11:39.02
Yeah, and that's true, not only on the battlefield,

915
01:11:39.02 --> 01:11:40.78
but it's also true in a conversation

916
01:11:40.78 --> 01:11:42.34
with another human being.

917
01:11:42.34 --> 01:11:45.54
It's also true when I say, hey, Dave,

918
01:11:45.54 --> 01:11:48.30
what's your plan with this client?

919
01:11:48.30 --> 01:11:50.58
Or here's how I think we should approach this client.

920
01:11:50.58 --> 01:11:52.98
I'm not saying this is how we should approach the client.

921
01:11:52.98 --> 01:11:54.50
I'm like, hey, I got an idea of what we could do

922
01:11:54.50 --> 01:11:56.34
with this client, what do you think?

923
01:11:56.34 --> 01:11:59.30
It's having a freaking open mind is what it is.

924
01:11:59.30 --> 01:12:02.54
And the minute, I said that while I go like,

925
01:12:02.54 --> 01:12:07.14
are people's minds, they're either opening or closing.

926
01:12:07.14 --> 01:12:08.90
And we can have some control over that.

927
01:12:08.90 --> 01:12:11.10
You can control whether you leave your mind open

928
01:12:11.10 --> 01:12:12.74
or whether you let your mind close,

929
01:12:12.74 --> 01:12:13.74
or at least I think.

930
01:12:13.74 --> 01:12:15.30
Well, let me, let me rephrase that.

931
01:12:15.30 --> 01:12:17.54
I think people have the ability to control

932
01:12:17.54 --> 01:12:19.06
whether they open their mind,

933
01:12:19.06 --> 01:12:20.90
but they don't have as much control over.

934
01:12:20.90 --> 01:12:22.78
If you're not conscious about your mind, just close up.

935
01:12:22.78 --> 01:12:24.54
And oftentimes we're looking

936
01:12:24.54 --> 01:12:27.26
our cognitive biases to just close that mind.

937
01:12:27.26 --> 01:12:29.18
I don't wanna hear what Dave has to say.

938
01:12:29.18 --> 01:12:31.70
So I think what we have to do is you have to form

939
01:12:31.70 --> 01:12:34.18
a habit of trying to keep your mind open,

940
01:12:34.18 --> 01:12:35.78
pouring it open.

941
01:12:35.78 --> 01:12:37.94
And I have to go back to the muster,

942
01:12:37.94 --> 01:12:39.26
I went back to that old conversation.

943
01:12:39.26 --> 01:12:41.62
How often do I have to admit that I'm wrong?

944
01:12:41.62 --> 01:12:42.78
And you know, I asked them,

945
01:12:42.78 --> 01:12:44.18
entire crowd at their muster.

946
01:12:44.18 --> 01:12:46.18
How often do you think I have to admit that I'm wrong?

947
01:12:46.18 --> 01:12:47.18
And everyone thinks I'm humble,

948
01:12:47.18 --> 01:12:49.94
they go all the time, yeah, probably 10 times a day,

949
01:12:49.94 --> 01:12:50.98
you admit that I'm wrong.

950
01:12:50.98 --> 01:12:52.94
And I'm like, no, almost never.

951
01:12:52.94 --> 01:12:54.54
I almost never admit that I'm wrong.

952
01:12:54.54 --> 01:12:56.18
Why do I almost never admit that I'm wrong?

953
01:12:56.18 --> 01:12:58.78
Because I never go into a conversation,

954
01:12:58.78 --> 01:13:02.22
telling everyone that I'm right or even thinking that I'm right.

955
01:13:02.22 --> 01:13:03.22
Yeah.

956
01:13:03.22 --> 01:13:05.38
So therefore I don't go in the conversation,

957
01:13:05.38 --> 01:13:08.94
saying, Dave, we need to do this with the client.

958
01:13:08.94 --> 01:13:10.22
And then Dave goes, well actually,

959
01:13:10.22 --> 01:13:11.02
I talked to the client,

960
01:13:11.02 --> 01:13:12.54
here's what's going on, here's what they actually need

961
01:13:12.54 --> 01:13:13.78
and I have to go damn it, I was wrong.

962
01:13:13.78 --> 01:13:15.06
No, instead I say, hey, Dave,

963
01:13:15.06 --> 01:13:17.22
here's what I'm thinking, what do you think?

964
01:13:17.22 --> 01:13:20.26
Yeah, that's one example of a hundred conversations

965
01:13:20.26 --> 01:13:22.86
that I have where I could go in there

966
01:13:22.86 --> 01:13:24.46
and try and be right.

967
01:13:24.46 --> 01:13:26.98
But instead I go in there with an open mind,

968
01:13:26.98 --> 01:13:31.02
instead of a close mind, it's so counterintuitive

969
01:13:31.02 --> 01:13:34.10
to think the connection between never being wrong

970
01:13:34.10 --> 01:13:36.34
or never having to, or rarely having to admit to the wrong

971
01:13:36.34 --> 01:13:37.66
isn't because you're right all the time.

972
01:13:37.66 --> 01:13:41.10
It's because you never entrench yourself in a position

973
01:13:41.10 --> 01:13:44.74
and the saying could be said for why you and I,

974
01:13:46.42 --> 01:13:48.70
whatever the better word is for argue, for disagree.

975
01:13:48.70 --> 01:13:51.82
Like how often you duck a disagree on a plan.

976
01:13:51.82 --> 01:13:53.14
It's like, well almost never.

977
01:13:53.14 --> 01:13:55.14
Like, oh, you must be perfectly on a line of everything.

978
01:13:55.14 --> 01:13:58.22
No, I just, I haven't predetermined the next 37 steps

979
01:13:58.22 --> 01:14:00.38
that we're gonna do neither a C and we'll move

980
01:14:00.38 --> 01:14:02.10
and I'll do it his way sometimes.

981
01:14:02.10 --> 01:14:02.94
We'll do it.

982
01:14:02.94 --> 01:14:03.58
My will get somebody else's input

983
01:14:03.58 --> 01:14:05.86
and none of us are committed to an outcome

984
01:14:05.86 --> 01:14:07.46
and the reason why we're disagree,

985
01:14:07.46 --> 01:14:09.02
we don't disagree on what we should do

986
01:14:09.02 --> 01:14:10.42
is that neither one of us come in

987
01:14:10.42 --> 01:14:12.86
with the conclusion of what we should do

988
01:14:12.86 --> 01:14:15.94
and how counterintuitive that is is the idea

989
01:14:15.94 --> 01:14:18.66
that the more committed you are,

990
01:14:18.66 --> 01:14:23.10
the less you will, the less you'll admit that you're wrong.

991
01:14:23.10 --> 01:14:25.70
And the exact opposite to show is the reason

992
01:14:25.70 --> 01:14:27.06
I'm doing it that I'm wrong, very often,

993
01:14:27.06 --> 01:14:28.90
it's because I don't walk in thinking that I'm right.

994
01:14:28.90 --> 01:14:31.50
Yeah, and actually you and I are very committed to an outcome.

995
01:14:31.50 --> 01:14:33.98
We're committed to having the best possible outcome we can have.

996
01:14:33.98 --> 01:14:37.02
With nothing to do with which outcome,

997
01:14:37.02 --> 01:14:39.54
which course is how we get there.

998
01:14:39.54 --> 01:14:41.90
It's like, oh, this is the best possible outcome.

999
01:14:41.90 --> 01:14:43.98
Dave came up with a way to make this the best outcome.

1000
01:14:43.98 --> 01:14:45.42
Well, possible outcome, that sounds awesome.

1001
01:14:45.42 --> 01:14:46.26
I'm in.

1002
01:14:46.26 --> 01:14:47.10
We'll do that all day long.

1003
01:14:47.10 --> 01:14:47.94
Yeah.

1004
01:14:47.94 --> 01:14:52.94
Ah, fast forward a little bit.

1005
01:14:54.06 --> 01:14:56.26
By the way, you get the book.

1006
01:14:56.26 --> 01:14:57.50
I haven't said that yet today.

1007
01:14:57.50 --> 01:14:58.98
So we're skipping all kinds of stuff,

1008
01:14:58.98 --> 01:15:00.66
but there's so much information in this book.

1009
01:15:00.66 --> 01:15:03.50
Those commanders with weak egos,

1010
01:15:03.50 --> 01:15:06.06
with over strong needs for approval

1011
01:15:06.06 --> 01:15:10.50
and the most closed minds will be the very ones

1012
01:15:10.50 --> 01:15:13.50
least able to tolerate the nagging doubts

1013
01:15:13.50 --> 01:15:15.62
of cognitive dissidents.

1014
01:15:15.62 --> 01:15:20.62
In other words, it will be the least rational

1015
01:15:20.62 --> 01:15:24.94
who are the most likely to reduce dissidents

1016
01:15:24.94 --> 01:15:28.10
by ignoring unpalpable intelligence.

1017
01:15:29.14 --> 01:15:34.14
So the person who can't tolerate those doubts

1018
01:15:35.90 --> 01:15:39.58
will just shut them out, which is a horrible thing.

1019
01:15:42.42 --> 01:15:43.10
Fast forward a little bit.

1020
01:15:43.10 --> 01:15:45.66
No better example is this an afforded by Townsend's

1021
01:15:45.66 --> 01:15:48.18
Occupational Cut since the advance up the Tigris

1022
01:15:48.18 --> 01:15:49.86
was totally unjustified by the facts

1023
01:15:49.86 --> 01:15:52.26
of which he was fully aware his dissidents,

1024
01:15:52.26 --> 01:15:54.22
when disaster struck must have been extreme

1025
01:15:54.22 --> 01:15:56.50
and to a man of his egotistical nature

1026
01:15:56.50 --> 01:15:59.42
depending of incident resolution.

1027
01:15:59.42 --> 01:16:01.98
So again, in the face of much contrary evidence,

1028
01:16:01.98 --> 01:16:03.46
he withdrew into cut.

1029
01:16:03.46 --> 01:16:05.86
The wiser and possible course of retreating debaust

1030
01:16:05.86 --> 01:16:07.82
would have been a greater admission of the lack

1031
01:16:07.82 --> 01:16:10.58
of justification for his previous decision

1032
01:16:10.58 --> 01:16:12.70
by the same token once inside cut.

1033
01:16:12.70 --> 01:16:15.10
Nothing would budge him because to break out,

1034
01:16:15.10 --> 01:16:17.70
even to assist those who had been sent to release him,

1035
01:16:17.70 --> 01:16:19.82
would have emphasized his lack of justification

1036
01:16:19.82 --> 01:16:21.18
for being there in the first place,

1037
01:16:21.18 --> 01:16:25.02
ensure an inability to admit one has been in the wrong

1038
01:16:25.02 --> 01:16:28.78
will be greater, the more wrong one has been

1039
01:16:28.78 --> 01:16:30.38
and the more wrong one has been,

1040
01:16:30.38 --> 01:16:33.70
the more bizarre will be the subsequent attempts

1041
01:16:33.70 --> 01:16:35.58
to justify the unjustifiable.

1042
01:16:36.46 --> 01:16:39.50
This is when people may just seem like they're freaking crazy.

1043
01:16:39.50 --> 01:16:43.98
We can now see the relationship between pontification

1044
01:16:43.98 --> 01:16:45.70
and cognitive dissidents.

1045
01:16:45.70 --> 01:16:48.42
Pontification is one of the ways in which people

1046
01:16:48.42 --> 01:16:50.30
try to resolve their dissidents.

1047
01:16:52.74 --> 01:16:54.62
I'm sorry, dissidents.

1048
01:16:54.62 --> 01:16:56.70
But there is another aspect of decision making,

1049
01:16:56.70 --> 01:16:59.94
no less hazardous, it is riskiness.

1050
01:17:00.94 --> 01:17:04.26
Research has shown that people vary in the degree

1051
01:17:04.26 --> 01:17:07.38
to which they adjust the riskiness of their decisions

1052
01:17:07.38 --> 01:17:10.58
to the realities of the external situations.

1053
01:17:10.58 --> 01:17:15.14
Individuals who become anxious under conditions of stress

1054
01:17:15.14 --> 01:17:17.42
or who are prone to be defensive

1055
01:17:17.42 --> 01:17:21.06
and deny anything that threatens their self-esteem

1056
01:17:21.06 --> 01:17:24.66
tend to be bad at judging whether the risks they take

1057
01:17:24.66 --> 01:17:27.66
or the caution they display are justified

1058
01:17:27.66 --> 01:17:30.62
by the possible outcomes of their decisions.

1059
01:17:31.54 --> 01:17:35.18
For example, they might well adopt the same degree

1060
01:17:35.18 --> 01:17:38.14
of caution whether placing a small bet

1061
01:17:38.14 --> 01:17:41.22
getting married or starting a nuclear war.

1062
01:17:42.14 --> 01:17:45.06
There is a sad irony about this state of affairs

1063
01:17:45.06 --> 01:17:49.18
for it means that those people who are most sensitive

1064
01:17:49.18 --> 01:17:52.26
to the success or failure of a decision

1065
01:17:52.26 --> 01:17:56.90
will be the very ones who make the biggest mistakes.

1066
01:17:57.70 --> 01:18:01.18
Conversely, less anxious individuals

1067
01:18:01.18 --> 01:18:02.98
will act more rationally

1068
01:18:02.98 --> 01:18:06.22
because they are able to grow the vote greater attention

1069
01:18:06.22 --> 01:18:09.18
to the realities with which they are confronted.

1070
01:18:10.66 --> 01:18:14.10
So when you got people that are nervous about decision making,

1071
01:18:14.10 --> 01:18:17.02
they're nervous about failing, they're nervous about,

1072
01:18:17.02 --> 01:18:18.54
oh, I better win this.

1073
01:18:18.54 --> 01:18:20.98
It's like what you see happen in sports, right?

1074
01:18:20.98 --> 01:18:24.50
Basketball teams up by 10, 12 points,

1075
01:18:24.50 --> 01:18:25.70
they're doing good.

1076
01:18:25.70 --> 01:18:28.18
They go up by 20 points, they start hitting three pointers.

1077
01:18:28.18 --> 01:18:29.22
There's no pressure anymore.

1078
01:18:29.22 --> 01:18:31.78
They're just like letting it fly.

1079
01:18:31.78 --> 01:18:33.34
That's when they do their best.

1080
01:18:33.34 --> 01:18:36.22
So someone that can go into a situation and say,

1081
01:18:36.22 --> 01:18:39.10
yep, there's some risks here, but I'm not worried.

1082
01:18:39.10 --> 01:18:41.54
If I look stupid, whatever, I'm doing the best I can.

1083
01:18:41.54 --> 01:18:42.38
Cool.

1084
01:18:42.38 --> 01:18:44.14
And then you look at the rational situation.

1085
01:18:44.14 --> 01:18:45.50
If you're in the like, oh my God,

1086
01:18:45.50 --> 01:18:47.42
I'm gonna look like such an idiot if I don't get this right.

1087
01:18:47.42 --> 01:18:48.26
This is gonna be horrible.

1088
01:18:48.26 --> 01:18:49.62
Guess where your focus is.

1089
01:18:49.62 --> 01:18:51.54
It's not on the realities of the situation.

1090
01:18:51.54 --> 01:18:54.42
It's not on rationalizing a good decision.

1091
01:18:54.42 --> 01:18:57.58
It's just focused on how bad you're gonna look if you screw it up.

1092
01:18:57.58 --> 01:18:59.54
So you make a bad decision.

1093
01:18:59.54 --> 01:19:02.62
So you're more likely to screw it up.

1094
01:19:02.62 --> 01:19:04.30
It's crazy.

1095
01:19:04.30 --> 01:19:05.70
Once I call it just to set,

1096
01:19:05.70 --> 01:19:06.94
under stress,

1097
01:19:06.94 --> 01:19:09.26
men are more likely to act irrationally

1098
01:19:09.26 --> 01:19:12.90
to strike out blindly or even to freeze into stupid

1099
01:19:12.90 --> 01:19:13.90
immobility.

1100
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:16.50
That's what stress does to people.

1101
01:19:16.50 --> 01:19:17.74
I've seen it.

1102
01:19:17.74 --> 01:19:19.02
You know, when you see that,

1103
01:19:19.02 --> 01:19:20.94
I've seen it in like a few cases

1104
01:19:20.94 --> 01:19:22.38
where someone stressed out and combat,

1105
01:19:22.38 --> 01:19:25.58
I may kind of lock up and you gotta kind of shake them out of it.

1106
01:19:25.58 --> 01:19:28.58
I've also seen it on you.

1107
01:19:28.58 --> 01:19:29.42
If you look at it,

1108
01:19:29.42 --> 01:19:31.50
broadly over a full deployment.

1109
01:19:31.50 --> 01:19:36.06
And you see people that are usually pretty solid

1110
01:19:36.06 --> 01:19:37.98
and they start either getting angry.

1111
01:19:37.98 --> 01:19:38.82
You start rational,

1112
01:19:38.82 --> 01:19:39.94
they start making dumb decisions.

1113
01:19:39.94 --> 01:19:42.50
And like, this stress is getting to you, man.

1114
01:19:42.50 --> 01:19:43.70
That's what's going on.

1115
01:19:43.70 --> 01:19:45.38
You gotta back them off a little bit.

1116
01:19:47.94 --> 01:19:50.22
But why should anxious and defensive individuals,

1117
01:19:50.22 --> 01:19:51.14
those who are,

1118
01:19:51.14 --> 01:19:52.54
those who have the most to lose,

1119
01:19:52.54 --> 01:19:55.74
act more irrationally than those less afflicted,

1120
01:19:55.74 --> 01:19:56.54
afflicted by neurosis.

1121
01:19:56.54 --> 01:19:58.58
Two reasons have been advanced.

1122
01:19:58.58 --> 01:20:01.10
The first has been well-stated by Deutsch,

1123
01:20:01.10 --> 01:20:02.82
some guy, I don't know who it is.

1124
01:20:02.82 --> 01:20:04.22
Didn't look it up, sorry.

1125
01:20:04.22 --> 01:20:07.42
Nervousness, the need to respond quickly

1126
01:20:07.42 --> 01:20:09.18
because of the fear one will lose

1127
01:20:09.18 --> 01:20:12.10
either the desire or ability to respond.

1128
01:20:12.10 --> 01:20:14.86
Enhances that likelihood that a response

1129
01:20:14.86 --> 01:20:17.94
will be triggered off by an insufficient stimulus

1130
01:20:17.94 --> 01:20:20.34
and thus makes for instability.

1131
01:20:21.38 --> 01:20:24.58
You know, it's a freaking good example of that.

1132
01:20:24.58 --> 01:20:29.58
Someone, you put someone in like a shooter situation

1133
01:20:30.22 --> 01:20:32.50
with simulation and you're like,

1134
01:20:32.50 --> 01:20:33.38
all right, go in the house.

1135
01:20:33.38 --> 01:20:34.54
If they've never done it before,

1136
01:20:34.54 --> 01:20:35.38
are they super nervous?

1137
01:20:35.38 --> 01:20:36.78
They're freaking shoot in the first person

1138
01:20:36.78 --> 01:20:39.14
that they see whether all the weapon or not, right?

1139
01:20:39.14 --> 01:20:41.46
They're gonna be quick to respond with fear

1140
01:20:41.46 --> 01:20:43.22
because they're nervous.

1141
01:20:43.22 --> 01:20:44.62
And the more you train them to that,

1142
01:20:44.62 --> 01:20:46.18
the better they'll get.

1143
01:20:46.18 --> 01:20:48.98
The second reason why I'm a proportion of people

1144
01:20:48.98 --> 01:20:50.30
will make irrational decisions

1145
01:20:50.30 --> 01:20:52.74
whose riskiness is unrelated to reality

1146
01:20:52.74 --> 01:20:55.74
is because being neurotic, they will strive

1147
01:20:55.74 --> 01:20:57.98
to maintain an image of themselves

1148
01:20:57.98 --> 01:21:02.98
as either quote bold and daring and quote or quote

1149
01:21:02.98 --> 01:21:07.30
as careful and judicious decision makers and quote

1150
01:21:07.30 --> 01:21:10.30
and the urge to sustain their particular conceit

1151
01:21:10.30 --> 01:21:14.50
will take precedence over the need to behave realistically.

1152
01:21:16.62 --> 01:21:19.30
So, luckily for me, like you were talking to

1153
01:21:19.30 --> 01:21:21.66
about me making small decisions,

1154
01:21:21.66 --> 01:21:22.74
luckily I figured that out

1155
01:21:22.74 --> 01:21:25.06
because I like being a person that's known as decisive

1156
01:21:25.06 --> 01:21:27.34
but luckily I figured out I could look and appear

1157
01:21:27.34 --> 01:21:30.10
and be decisive by making small decisions.

1158
01:21:30.10 --> 01:21:31.54
So I didn't have to try and figure everything out

1159
01:21:31.54 --> 01:21:34.42
everything I want, which is what I recommend to people do.

1160
01:21:37.70 --> 01:21:39.90
He closes out this chapter saying,

1161
01:21:39.90 --> 01:21:42.82
since decision making is by definition

1162
01:21:42.82 --> 01:21:46.10
a cognitive process, then obviously the oldest theory

1163
01:21:46.10 --> 01:21:49.14
is in one sense of tourism.

1164
01:21:49.14 --> 01:21:53.22
But it by no means follows that the simple hypothesis

1165
01:21:53.22 --> 01:21:55.42
of low intelligence fits the bill.

1166
01:21:55.42 --> 01:21:56.98
Again, this whole chapter is about intelligence

1167
01:21:56.98 --> 01:22:00.90
so he's saying, listen, decision making is about how fast

1168
01:22:00.90 --> 01:22:02.90
you can think in your cognitive capability,

1169
01:22:02.90 --> 01:22:04.94
but it doesn't cover everything.

1170
01:22:04.94 --> 01:22:07.50
On the contrary by looking further into the nature

1171
01:22:07.50 --> 01:22:10.14
of decision making process where you're compelled to entertain

1172
01:22:10.14 --> 01:22:12.50
another rather different possibility,

1173
01:22:12.50 --> 01:22:16.34
namely that the apparent intellectual failings of some military

1174
01:22:16.34 --> 01:22:19.82
commanders are due not to lack of intelligence

1175
01:22:19.82 --> 01:22:21.74
but to their feelings.

1176
01:22:23.02 --> 01:22:26.94
Cognitive dissonance, pontification, denial,

1177
01:22:26.94 --> 01:22:30.46
risk taking an anti-intellectualism

1178
01:22:30.46 --> 01:22:34.58
are all in reality more concerned with emotion

1179
01:22:34.58 --> 01:22:35.66
than with intelligence.

1180
01:22:38.10 --> 01:22:41.86
I mean, it's not another thing we say at the mustard.

1181
01:22:41.86 --> 01:22:43.26
Who here has made a great decision

1182
01:22:43.26 --> 01:22:44.42
when they were super emotional?

1183
01:22:44.42 --> 01:22:46.14
No one raises their hand.

1184
01:22:46.14 --> 01:22:48.54
That's why we teach people to detach from their emotions

1185
01:22:48.54 --> 01:22:50.02
so that you can make good decisions.

1186
01:22:50.02 --> 01:22:52.30
Do you detach 100%, no, but you need to detach

1187
01:22:52.30 --> 01:22:55.38
so that they're not driving your decision-making process.

1188
01:22:55.38 --> 01:23:00.14
The susceptibility to cognitive dissonance, the tendency

1189
01:23:00.14 --> 01:23:03.22
to pontificate and the inability to adjust the riskiness

1190
01:23:03.22 --> 01:23:05.46
of decisions to the real situation

1191
01:23:05.46 --> 01:23:07.98
are a product of such neurotic disabilities

1192
01:23:07.98 --> 01:23:10.62
as extreme anxiety under stress,

1193
01:23:10.62 --> 01:23:14.54
low self esteem, nervousness, the need for approval

1194
01:23:14.54 --> 01:23:17.02
and general defensiveness.

1195
01:23:17.02 --> 01:23:22.02
These, it seems, over and above his level of intelligence

1196
01:23:22.42 --> 01:23:26.18
are the factors which interfere with what a man decides

1197
01:23:26.18 --> 01:23:29.54
to do in a given situation.

1198
01:23:29.54 --> 01:23:31.46
They keep made a pretty good case for that.

1199
01:23:31.46 --> 01:23:35.50
Not about a smart, you are, it's a smart place, some role.

1200
01:23:35.50 --> 01:23:36.58
I mean, obviously, if you're an idiot,

1201
01:23:36.58 --> 01:23:38.22
you can make a bunch of bad decisions,

1202
01:23:38.22 --> 01:23:42.74
but that's not the major number in this equation.

1203
01:23:42.74 --> 01:23:46.50
Most people are making bad decisions based on their emotions,

1204
01:23:46.50 --> 01:23:49.34
based on their feelings, based on their psychology.

1205
01:23:51.06 --> 01:23:52.58
And this whole thing ties into Dave,

1206
01:23:52.58 --> 01:23:53.90
this is what you were getting at earlier.

1207
01:23:53.90 --> 01:23:56.54
You got about a whole chapter here talking about what you,

1208
01:23:56.54 --> 01:23:59.02
what you started, the road you started to go down,

1209
01:23:59.02 --> 01:24:01.26
this chapter is called military organizations.

1210
01:24:02.38 --> 01:24:03.98
And it says military organizations make

1211
01:24:03.98 --> 01:24:05.94
for military incompetence in two ways,

1212
01:24:05.94 --> 01:24:08.46
directly by forcing their members to act in a fashion

1213
01:24:08.46 --> 01:24:11.10
that is not always conducive to military success

1214
01:24:11.10 --> 01:24:14.10
and indirectly by attracting, selecting and promoting

1215
01:24:14.10 --> 01:24:16.90
a minority of people with particular defects

1216
01:24:16.90 --> 01:24:18.82
of intellect and personality.

1217
01:24:18.82 --> 01:24:20.38
So this is what you were talking about.

1218
01:24:20.38 --> 01:24:21.70
Yeah.

1219
01:24:21.70 --> 01:24:24.54
How the system will set up to promote,

1220
01:24:24.54 --> 01:24:25.70
and this is going one step further.

1221
01:24:25.70 --> 01:24:27.66
You talked about how the system can promote people,

1222
01:24:27.66 --> 01:24:29.30
they can figure out how they're way to get through it.

1223
01:24:29.30 --> 01:24:31.26
And also can attract people like this.

1224
01:24:31.26 --> 01:24:32.10
Yeah.

1225
01:24:32.10 --> 01:24:33.46
People that are looking for a system

1226
01:24:33.46 --> 01:24:35.34
that they can figure out how to get through.

1227
01:24:35.34 --> 01:24:38.70
The root cause of all this is that since men are not

1228
01:24:38.70 --> 01:24:41.42
by nature, all that well equipped for aggression

1229
01:24:41.42 --> 01:24:44.46
on a grand scale, they have had to develop a complex

1230
01:24:44.46 --> 01:24:46.46
of rules, conventions, and ways of thinking,

1231
01:24:46.46 --> 01:24:47.70
which in the course of time,

1232
01:24:47.70 --> 01:24:50.10
ossify into outmoded tradition,

1233
01:24:50.10 --> 01:24:53.14
curious ritual, inappropriate dogma,

1234
01:24:53.14 --> 01:24:58.14
and that bane of some military organizations irrelevant bullshit,

1235
01:24:58.34 --> 01:25:00.54
which we had a conversation on here about chicken shit,

1236
01:25:00.54 --> 01:25:01.54
chicken shit and bullshit.

1237
01:25:01.54 --> 01:25:05.18
I think chicken shit is the term that's used nowadays.

1238
01:25:05.18 --> 01:25:06.46
He's used in the term bullshit.

1239
01:25:06.46 --> 01:25:08.06
And he actually throughout this calls it

1240
01:25:08.06 --> 01:25:08.90
bull.

1241
01:25:08.90 --> 01:25:10.10
I think I'm going to call it bullshit most of the time.

1242
01:25:10.10 --> 01:25:11.34
He calls it bullshit here.

1243
01:25:11.34 --> 01:25:13.78
But this idea of bullshit, chicken shit stuff

1244
01:25:13.78 --> 01:25:16.22
that you're polishing, your belt buckle,

1245
01:25:16.22 --> 01:25:17.62
you're polishing your boots,

1246
01:25:17.62 --> 01:25:19.02
you're doing all these things,

1247
01:25:19.02 --> 01:25:20.38
these things in the military,

1248
01:25:20.38 --> 01:25:23.02
you're going to call it chicken shit or bullshit.

1249
01:25:23.02 --> 01:25:27.42
But those things are a huge part of some military organizations.

1250
01:25:27.42 --> 01:25:29.10
And as we're going to find, there's some reasons for it,

1251
01:25:29.10 --> 01:25:31.90
but there's also when it gets out of hand.

1252
01:25:31.90 --> 01:25:32.62
Fast forward a little bit,

1253
01:25:32.62 --> 01:25:35.22
probably speaking, human activities may be regarded

1254
01:25:35.22 --> 01:25:39.62
as falling into one or the other of two main groups.

1255
01:25:39.62 --> 01:25:41.54
Those which are directly instinctual

1256
01:25:41.54 --> 01:25:42.42
and those which are not.

1257
01:25:42.42 --> 01:25:45.06
So we all got some things that we instinctively want to do.

1258
01:25:45.06 --> 01:25:48.62
Into the first, which involves what have been succinctly

1259
01:25:48.62 --> 01:25:51.30
described as the three F's,

1260
01:25:51.30 --> 01:25:54.66
feeding, fighting, and reproduction.

1261
01:25:55.78 --> 01:25:58.78
Fall such robust pastimes as

1262
01:25:58.78 --> 01:26:00.98
feudalism, professional piety,

1263
01:26:00.98 --> 01:26:03.30
prostitution, and soldering.

1264
01:26:03.30 --> 01:26:06.42
So look, we got these three F's feeding,

1265
01:26:06.42 --> 01:26:08.54
fighting, and reproduction.

1266
01:26:08.54 --> 01:26:11.30
And from that, we get things like boxing,

1267
01:26:11.30 --> 01:26:13.14
we get things like professional piety,

1268
01:26:13.14 --> 01:26:14.66
eating, and chefs, and restaurants.

1269
01:26:14.66 --> 01:26:16.38
We also get prostitution.

1270
01:26:16.38 --> 01:26:18.54
We also get soldering.

1271
01:26:18.54 --> 01:26:20.14
Those are all kind of, you can marry those up

1272
01:26:20.14 --> 01:26:21.30
from where those came from.

1273
01:26:22.54 --> 01:26:25.42
Into the second group, fall all those other vocations,

1274
01:26:25.42 --> 01:26:27.02
which, though, sometimes,

1275
01:26:27.02 --> 01:26:28.70
subserving the basic drives,

1276
01:26:28.70 --> 01:26:30.98
do not have as their end product,

1277
01:26:30.98 --> 01:26:35.54
the original consumer territory response.

1278
01:26:37.42 --> 01:26:39.30
Besides this most important difference,

1279
01:26:39.30 --> 01:26:44.26
the instinctual vocations have three other characteristics,

1280
01:26:44.26 --> 01:26:48.78
which differentiate them from those in the second category.

1281
01:26:48.78 --> 01:26:52.86
They may involve unlearned patterns of behavior,

1282
01:26:52.86 --> 01:26:55.70
are motivated by crude, if powerful emotions,

1283
01:26:55.70 --> 01:26:59.58
fear, lust, and rage, and are designed to culminate

1284
01:26:59.58 --> 01:27:03.82
in an unlearned response of a distinctly physical kind.

1285
01:27:03.82 --> 01:27:05.82
So those are the three F's, right?

1286
01:27:05.82 --> 01:27:09.90
They're, you've got powerful emotions tied to them,

1287
01:27:09.90 --> 01:27:12.74
fear, lust, and rage, and they,

1288
01:27:12.74 --> 01:27:15.42
where they get you is something physical.

1289
01:27:15.42 --> 01:27:18.50
You're eating, you're fighting, or you're reproducing.

1290
01:27:22.14 --> 01:27:25.26
It goes into prostitution, but prostitution is easy

1291
01:27:25.26 --> 01:27:28.42
because the transformation of an unlearned drive

1292
01:27:28.42 --> 01:27:31.14
into a money-making career is more a matter

1293
01:27:31.14 --> 01:27:34.74
of realizing a potential than seriously modifying nature.

1294
01:27:36.02 --> 01:27:38.34
And he goes into this thing about this guy

1295
01:27:38.34 --> 01:27:41.26
who interviewed prostitutes, and this one prostitute said,

1296
01:27:41.26 --> 01:27:43.42
I've been working in a factory for five years

1297
01:27:43.42 --> 01:27:46.18
before I realized I was sitting on a fortune all the time.

1298
01:27:47.58 --> 01:27:50.38
I kind of had to throw that quote in there.

1299
01:27:50.38 --> 01:27:53.50
It goes on down the same path,

1300
01:27:53.50 --> 01:27:55.10
talking about a professional soldier.

1301
01:27:55.10 --> 01:27:59.02
The original purpose of interest species aggression

1302
01:27:59.02 --> 01:28:02.34
is not destruction, but distribution.

1303
01:28:02.34 --> 01:28:05.18
So why do people fight, why do animals fight?

1304
01:28:05.18 --> 01:28:07.46
Because we got to freaking get away from you a little bit.

1305
01:28:07.46 --> 01:28:09.86
You can't get too close to me, not too close to my resources,

1306
01:28:09.86 --> 01:28:13.26
not too close to my woman, like you need to get your own

1307
01:28:13.26 --> 01:28:14.46
activities going.

1308
01:28:14.46 --> 01:28:16.66
This is my A.L. who's my area of operations.

1309
01:28:16.66 --> 01:28:21.46
In lower forms of life, the instinct of aggression is controlled

1310
01:28:21.46 --> 01:28:23.46
by a language of signs and countersign,

1311
01:28:23.46 --> 01:28:26.74
so that everyone remains spread out with a minimum amount of bloodshed.

1312
01:28:26.74 --> 01:28:29.38
Moreover, those animals best equipped to do each other.

1313
01:28:29.38 --> 01:28:32.94
And injury are also those with the most effective controls

1314
01:28:32.94 --> 01:28:34.18
against so doing.

1315
01:28:34.18 --> 01:28:37.62
A dog, tackless enough to encroach upon a rival's territory,

1316
01:28:37.62 --> 01:28:39.94
maybe come involved in a noisy scuffle,

1317
01:28:39.94 --> 01:28:42.74
but has only to drop his tail, roll over,

1318
01:28:42.74 --> 01:28:45.38
and urinate to terminate the attack upon his person.

1319
01:28:45.38 --> 01:28:46.82
Right? So that's what animals do.

1320
01:28:46.82 --> 01:28:49.66
And even going out, L.C.T.

1321
01:28:49.66 --> 01:28:54.66
The elk, they fight hard and occasionally do kill each other,

1322
01:28:54.66 --> 01:28:57.50
but most of the time, they just aim in, like,

1323
01:28:57.50 --> 01:29:00.66
I'm dominant, you go away, and the guy's like, cool.

1324
01:29:00.66 --> 01:29:03.46
So that's the way it's supposed to be.

1325
01:29:03.46 --> 01:29:06.34
You're supposed to be able to sort of surrender back up,

1326
01:29:06.34 --> 01:29:08.74
give some space, and that makes sense.

1327
01:29:08.74 --> 01:29:10.14
So that's the difference.

1328
01:29:10.14 --> 01:29:13.42
The point that he's trying to bear here is,

1329
01:29:13.42 --> 01:29:18.66
hey, I'll prostitute, she's still doing something that just makes sense

1330
01:29:18.66 --> 01:29:21.42
on an instinctual level, right?

1331
01:29:21.42 --> 01:29:27.82
Whereas humans with war, things all of a sudden aren't so instinctual anymore.

1332
01:29:27.82 --> 01:29:31.14
Because now, look, if it was in caveman days,

1333
01:29:31.14 --> 01:29:35.22
and you came into my territory, I'd probably beat you up and you'd run away.

1334
01:29:35.22 --> 01:29:38.14
And I'm not going to waste any energy trying to go catch you.

1335
01:29:38.14 --> 01:29:40.94
I don't care, you just stay away from me.

1336
01:29:40.94 --> 01:29:43.74
Well, when we get to war, now it's a lot different.

1337
01:29:43.74 --> 01:29:45.42
So he goes into that a little bit.

1338
01:29:45.42 --> 01:29:48.82
Humans, they have made up for a lack of natural weapons

1339
01:29:48.82 --> 01:29:51.90
by acquiring some far more deadly artificial ones, right?

1340
01:29:51.90 --> 01:29:54.06
We don't have horns on our head.

1341
01:29:54.06 --> 01:29:56.22
We don't have big teeth where we can rip each other apart.

1342
01:29:56.22 --> 01:29:58.46
Sure, we can choke each other if we have to do it.

1343
01:29:58.46 --> 01:29:59.46
We don't.

1344
01:29:59.46 --> 01:30:03.34
But we don't have these things so we make other weapons, right?

1345
01:30:03.34 --> 01:30:08.54
Clubs, spears, knives, guns, missiles.

1346
01:30:11.98 --> 01:30:15.30
Yet other difficulties, and this is where you're going to take

1347
01:30:15.30 --> 01:30:17.66
everything we just talked about, and now we're going to take it

1348
01:30:17.66 --> 01:30:19.54
into this military context.

1349
01:30:19.54 --> 01:30:23.46
And this is something that I have talked about before.

1350
01:30:23.46 --> 01:30:27.02
I've talked about the difference of decentralized command.

1351
01:30:27.02 --> 01:30:31.30
And when you have centralized command,

1352
01:30:31.30 --> 01:30:34.50
and the fact that when decentralized command

1353
01:30:34.50 --> 01:30:38.10
started to come to fruition is when you didn't have conscripts anymore.

1354
01:30:38.10 --> 01:30:41.30
You had people that you could say, all right, here's

1355
01:30:41.30 --> 01:30:43.34
what we're trying to make happen, go make it happen.

1356
01:30:43.34 --> 01:30:46.42
You have to say, this is what you need to go to go do it.

1357
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:48.42
And if you don't do it, I'm going to shoot you.

1358
01:30:48.42 --> 01:30:50.98
That's a different type of discipline.

1359
01:30:50.98 --> 01:30:58.58
It's imposed discipline versus unit discipline.

1360
01:30:58.58 --> 01:31:00.34
So we're going to get into that a little bit here.

1361
01:31:00.34 --> 01:31:02.34
Yet other difficulties have been posed

1362
01:31:02.34 --> 01:31:04.98
by the sheer size of human-waring groups.

1363
01:31:04.98 --> 01:31:08.66
With the transition from small parties of hostile tribesmen

1364
01:31:08.66 --> 01:31:14.70
to large mercenary armies came problems of motivation and control.

1365
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:18.38
So if you, if there was just the five of us and our clan,

1366
01:31:18.38 --> 01:31:20.62
and we were just event, I didn't need to motivate Echo

1367
01:31:20.62 --> 01:31:21.46
to do his job.

1368
01:31:21.46 --> 01:31:23.34
If you didn't do his job, we were all going to get overrun

1369
01:31:23.34 --> 01:31:24.34
and we're all going to die.

1370
01:31:24.34 --> 01:31:27.98
So there was no real reason for me to have to impose discipline

1371
01:31:27.98 --> 01:31:28.34
on you.

1372
01:31:28.34 --> 01:31:29.26
We just had it.

1373
01:31:29.26 --> 01:31:31.54
We just knew that we had to fight together.

1374
01:31:31.54 --> 01:31:32.82
We knew if we got overrun there,

1375
01:31:32.82 --> 01:31:34.58
we're going to come and take our food and take our women,

1376
01:31:34.58 --> 01:31:36.06
and that was game over for us.

1377
01:31:36.06 --> 01:31:41.94
So there wasn't any real need to to vote, quote, motivate you.

1378
01:31:41.94 --> 01:31:43.50
But things are bigger now.

1379
01:31:43.50 --> 01:31:48.46
Since the history of warfare is largely that of many who,

1380
01:31:48.46 --> 01:31:51.46
though through poverty or the press gang,

1381
01:31:51.46 --> 01:31:54.14
were forced to take up arms for a cause

1382
01:31:54.14 --> 01:31:57.26
which few could even comprehend the evoking

1383
01:31:57.26 --> 01:32:00.42
and direction of aggression called for special measures.

1384
01:32:00.42 --> 01:32:03.30
So once we have an army where Echo doesn't really quite sure

1385
01:32:03.30 --> 01:32:03.90
why the hell.

1386
01:32:03.90 --> 01:32:07.02
He knew when it was our cave, our little area

1387
01:32:07.02 --> 01:32:10.10
and we were defending our tribe, he understood that.

1388
01:32:10.10 --> 01:32:13.14
But once he's like, all of a sudden, he's in a foreign country.

1389
01:32:13.14 --> 01:32:18.50
And I'm giving him a musket and I'm saying,

1390
01:32:18.50 --> 01:32:19.82
OK, dude, we're going to fight.

1391
01:32:19.82 --> 01:32:21.06
He's kind of thinking, wait a second.

1392
01:32:21.06 --> 01:32:23.54
I don't even live anywhere near here.

1393
01:32:23.54 --> 01:32:25.90
So now we need to come up with some special measures

1394
01:32:25.90 --> 01:32:29.66
to get Echo to direct his aggression towards the enemy.

1395
01:32:29.66 --> 01:32:30.58
How do we do that?

1396
01:32:30.58 --> 01:32:34.06
These included devices to ensure group cohesion,

1397
01:32:34.06 --> 01:32:38.06
to incite hostility, to enforce obedience

1398
01:32:38.06 --> 01:32:39.70
and to suppress mutiny.

1399
01:32:39.70 --> 01:32:42.34
Because once again, I put, I take Echo on a ship,

1400
01:32:42.34 --> 01:32:44.34
give them a sword and be like, OK, dude,

1401
01:32:44.34 --> 01:32:47.22
we're going to go and fight these people you've never seen before.

1402
01:32:47.22 --> 01:32:48.74
They're not close to your family.

1403
01:32:48.74 --> 01:32:51.58
They're not close to your area of operations.

1404
01:32:51.58 --> 01:32:53.86
And not only do I need to get you to hate them,

1405
01:32:53.86 --> 01:32:55.66
I need to make sure you don't freaking just turn that sword

1406
01:32:55.66 --> 01:32:58.18
to me and cut my head off.

1407
01:32:58.18 --> 01:32:59.82
Because it doesn't make any sense, right?

1408
01:32:59.82 --> 01:33:01.94
It doesn't make any sense to Echo Charles,

1409
01:33:01.94 --> 01:33:03.66
who's got his tribe.

1410
01:33:03.66 --> 01:33:05.70
It doesn't make any sense for you to go to some other place

1411
01:33:05.70 --> 01:33:06.34
and fight.

1412
01:33:06.34 --> 01:33:07.94
So how are we going to make that happen?

1413
01:33:07.94 --> 01:33:10.62
Well, we got to make group cohesion.

1414
01:33:10.62 --> 01:33:12.58
We got it in sight hostility against the enemy.

1415
01:33:12.58 --> 01:33:17.14
We got to enforce obedience and make sure we don't have a mutiny.

1416
01:33:17.14 --> 01:33:20.62
They also included means whereby the intentions of leaders

1417
01:33:20.62 --> 01:33:24.42
could be translated into a concerted action by followers.

1418
01:33:24.42 --> 01:33:28.98
In short, it called for two other components of militarism.

1419
01:33:28.98 --> 01:33:33.54
Firstly, a system of rewards and punishment of rank,

1420
01:33:33.54 --> 01:33:36.42
metals, battle emblems and prize money.

1421
01:33:36.42 --> 01:33:40.58
That's what's somewhat a dangling fun of you, carrot.

1422
01:33:40.58 --> 01:33:44.06
Of confidential reports, court marshals and the lash.

1423
01:33:44.06 --> 01:33:44.90
There's the stick.

1424
01:33:44.90 --> 01:33:46.78
Don't do it to tell you, the court marshal you.

1425
01:33:46.78 --> 01:33:49.50
I'm going to whip you, whatever.

1426
01:33:49.50 --> 01:33:55.10
And secondly, a system of orders and overlearned drills

1427
01:33:55.10 --> 01:33:57.82
whereby complex patterns of behavior

1428
01:33:57.82 --> 01:34:02.06
could be set in motion by the briefest of instructions.

1429
01:34:02.06 --> 01:34:04.30
So I'm actually going to train you.

1430
01:34:04.30 --> 01:34:07.22
I like how echo Charles become my soldier today.

1431
01:34:07.22 --> 01:34:08.62
You like that?

1432
01:34:08.62 --> 01:34:09.82
I'm going to train you.

1433
01:34:09.82 --> 01:34:12.18
So I got to end up with a pattern of behavior

1434
01:34:12.18 --> 01:34:15.26
that becomes instilled in you.

1435
01:34:15.26 --> 01:34:17.74
No less important for a theory of military incompetence

1436
01:34:17.74 --> 01:34:20.62
is the means whereby militarism is administered

1437
01:34:20.62 --> 01:34:22.54
and its continuity insured.

1438
01:34:22.54 --> 01:34:24.26
Originally, so now we're going to get into this.

1439
01:34:24.26 --> 01:34:27.54
Originally, since combat was largely a matter of brute force,

1440
01:34:27.54 --> 01:34:30.10
we must suppose that the strongest came to the top.

1441
01:34:30.10 --> 01:34:34.54
In fighting, as in prostitution, vital statistics gain the day.

1442
01:34:34.54 --> 01:34:37.58
A sort of natural selection according to the criteria

1443
01:34:37.58 --> 01:34:39.82
that were essentially physical.

1444
01:34:39.82 --> 01:34:43.06
But in the course of time, the growing number of personnel

1445
01:34:43.06 --> 01:34:45.90
involved and improvements in technique

1446
01:34:45.90 --> 01:34:48.46
required some revision of earlier criteria.

1447
01:34:48.46 --> 01:34:51.42
A distinction became necessary between organizers

1448
01:34:51.42 --> 01:34:55.34
and the organized between the brains and the brawn.

1449
01:34:55.34 --> 01:34:59.58
So now, just the fact that echo's the biggest, strongest guy

1450
01:34:59.58 --> 01:35:01.42
that doesn't necessarily mean that's

1451
01:35:01.42 --> 01:35:02.70
going to make the difference in the battle

1452
01:35:02.70 --> 01:35:04.34
because we got a bunch of people.

1453
01:35:04.34 --> 01:35:06.18
And if I can organize more people against,

1454
01:35:06.18 --> 01:35:09.02
or if the enemy organizes five people just

1455
01:35:09.02 --> 01:35:10.98
to fight echo echoes going down.

1456
01:35:10.98 --> 01:35:12.54
So I need to get some people to support echo.

1457
01:35:12.54 --> 01:35:13.98
Now we got to freaking army.

1458
01:35:16.54 --> 01:35:19.82
To this end, civil government might have been expected

1459
01:35:19.82 --> 01:35:23.02
to construct armies in which the dichotomies,

1460
01:35:23.02 --> 01:35:25.46
in which such dichotomies obtained.

1461
01:35:25.46 --> 01:35:28.82
One might have expected that officers would have been chosen

1462
01:35:28.82 --> 01:35:32.26
for their brains and the hierarchy of command based

1463
01:35:32.26 --> 01:35:34.90
upon merit and professional expertise.

1464
01:35:34.90 --> 01:35:37.98
So echo, you and I were on the same tribe.

1465
01:35:37.98 --> 01:35:39.22
We've formed an army.

1466
01:35:39.22 --> 01:35:41.78
We take all the big guys and we're putting you guys

1467
01:35:41.78 --> 01:35:42.38
in the front lines.

1468
01:35:42.38 --> 01:35:43.38
That makes sense, right?

1469
01:35:43.38 --> 01:35:45.50
Because you're the ones that are going to crush the enemy.

1470
01:35:45.50 --> 01:35:47.42
We're also going to take our smartest dude

1471
01:35:47.42 --> 01:35:49.10
and be like, hey, you're really good at organizing.

1472
01:35:49.10 --> 01:35:50.34
People, you've got a loud voice.

1473
01:35:50.34 --> 01:35:51.58
You come up with good plans.

1474
01:35:51.58 --> 01:35:52.10
Cool.

1475
01:35:52.10 --> 01:35:55.18
Dave, you're going to run this battalion over here.

1476
01:35:55.18 --> 01:35:57.46
And Dave's like, cool, got it.

1477
01:35:57.46 --> 01:35:58.58
That's the way we should do it.

1478
01:35:58.58 --> 01:35:59.70
Dave's proved himself.

1479
01:35:59.70 --> 01:36:00.42
He's smart.

1480
01:36:00.42 --> 01:36:00.42
Right.

1481
01:36:00.42 --> 01:36:01.14
So that's what we're doing.

1482
01:36:01.14 --> 01:36:02.10
And that's what we think we're doing.

1483
01:36:02.10 --> 01:36:03.98
That's what makes sense to do.

1484
01:36:03.98 --> 01:36:04.30
Right?

1485
01:36:04.30 --> 01:36:06.74
That clearly makes sense.

1486
01:36:06.74 --> 01:36:11.78
However, for example, in Britain, civil government

1487
01:36:11.78 --> 01:36:16.06
did nothing of the kind by methods of purchase and nomination,

1488
01:36:16.06 --> 01:36:18.46
the control of the army was given over to men who,

1489
01:36:18.46 --> 01:36:20.66
with nothing to gain from revolution,

1490
01:36:20.66 --> 01:36:23.58
would remain the loyal, apolitical supporters

1491
01:36:23.58 --> 01:36:26.18
of the existing regime, professional ability,

1492
01:36:26.18 --> 01:36:29.50
energy and dedication of the job counted for little.

1493
01:36:29.50 --> 01:36:31.22
So that's not how they selected.

1494
01:36:31.22 --> 01:36:33.90
They didn't say, hey, who's better at decision-making?

1495
01:36:33.90 --> 01:36:37.54
You know, echo, you know what?

1496
01:36:37.54 --> 01:36:38.58
You're going to be front lines.

1497
01:36:38.58 --> 01:36:41.54
Dave, you know, you got those quick thoughts.

1498
01:36:41.54 --> 01:36:43.78
We're putting you in command.

1499
01:36:43.78 --> 01:36:44.70
What the British do?

1500
01:36:44.70 --> 01:36:45.42
No.

1501
01:36:45.42 --> 01:36:46.22
You know what they said?

1502
01:36:46.22 --> 01:36:48.70
Who's going to be loyal who can pay the most?

1503
01:36:48.70 --> 01:36:50.62
We'll put you in command.

1504
01:36:50.62 --> 01:36:52.66
By the way, so check this out.

1505
01:36:52.66 --> 01:36:55.26
How does that work?

1506
01:36:56.46 --> 01:37:00.46
Dave, you have money to buy a commission.

1507
01:37:01.90 --> 01:37:03.42
What do you think of the system?

1508
01:37:05.22 --> 01:37:06.14
What do you think of it?

1509
01:37:06.14 --> 01:37:07.14
Yeah, I like this.

1510
01:37:07.14 --> 01:37:07.98
You like the system.

1511
01:37:07.98 --> 01:37:11.14
And you want to, importantly, you want to maintain the system.

1512
01:37:11.14 --> 01:37:12.14
Absolutely.

1513
01:37:12.14 --> 01:37:13.82
Echo, you kind of broke.

1514
01:37:14.82 --> 01:37:15.82
Right?

1515
01:37:15.82 --> 01:37:18.22
You don't, you don't really like the system.

1516
01:37:18.22 --> 01:37:19.46
Because you have been able to succeed in it.

1517
01:37:19.46 --> 01:37:20.94
You probably want to change the system.

1518
01:37:20.94 --> 01:37:21.94
So you know what?

1519
01:37:21.94 --> 01:37:23.26
I'm not putting you in charge.

1520
01:37:23.26 --> 01:37:27.38
I'm going to put the guy in charge that succeeded in the system that wants the status

1521
01:37:27.38 --> 01:37:28.38
quo.

1522
01:37:28.38 --> 01:37:29.94
He wants to protect.

1523
01:37:29.94 --> 01:37:34.66
He's going to fight and he's going to use you to fight, to protect what he's already

1524
01:37:34.66 --> 01:37:35.66
got.

1525
01:37:35.66 --> 01:37:37.78
Status and money.

1526
01:37:37.78 --> 01:37:40.46
That's the dynamic.

1527
01:37:40.46 --> 01:37:47.90
That's what he means when he says, man who, with nothing to gain from revolution, would

1528
01:37:47.90 --> 01:37:49.30
remain loyal.

1529
01:37:49.30 --> 01:37:50.30
He can pay for this.

1530
01:37:50.30 --> 01:37:54.22
The reason he can pay for this is because he's done all right in the system.

1531
01:37:54.22 --> 01:37:56.22
How do I benefit from a revolution here?

1532
01:37:56.22 --> 01:37:58.22
Yeah, I don't want that at all.

1533
01:37:58.22 --> 01:37:59.22
No, not at all.

1534
01:37:59.22 --> 01:38:00.22
So you're willing to.

1535
01:38:00.22 --> 01:38:04.02
So once I give you a position and I give you authority, you can actually use your authority

1536
01:38:04.02 --> 01:38:07.06
now to maintain the status quo, which is what you want.

1537
01:38:07.06 --> 01:38:09.82
And by the way, you can also impose your status quo.

1538
01:38:09.82 --> 01:38:13.78
Because if you guys go take over another chunk of land, guess who's going to get it?

1539
01:38:13.78 --> 01:38:14.78
Not Echo.

1540
01:38:14.78 --> 01:38:17.78
He fought for it, but Dave's going to get it.

1541
01:38:17.78 --> 01:38:22.78
Maybe we'll give Dave, we'll give Echo a little sliver of maybe you get some little bit

1542
01:38:22.78 --> 01:38:25.86
of gold, you're in a little bit of booty for you.

1543
01:38:25.86 --> 01:38:28.10
But Dave's going to get the land.

1544
01:38:28.10 --> 01:38:31.30
So we'll keep you a little bit happy.

1545
01:38:31.30 --> 01:38:33.62
But Dave wants this to succeed.

1546
01:38:33.62 --> 01:38:41.22
And Dave's going to sacrifice a bunch of you, a bunch of echoes for this situation.

1547
01:38:41.22 --> 01:38:42.22
Fast forward a little bit.

1548
01:38:42.22 --> 01:38:44.30
The central nature of militarism should now be clear.

1549
01:38:44.30 --> 01:38:48.86
We see it as an ever-increasing web of rules, restrictions, and constraints presided over

1550
01:38:48.86 --> 01:38:50.30
buying a leap.

1551
01:38:50.30 --> 01:38:54.82
One of whose motives was to preserve the status quo, exactly what I just said.

1552
01:38:54.82 --> 01:38:56.38
How do I keep Echo in line?

1553
01:38:56.38 --> 01:38:58.10
Here's the rules.

1554
01:38:58.10 --> 01:38:59.10
Here's your uniform.

1555
01:38:59.10 --> 01:39:00.78
Here's what you've got to do.

1556
01:39:00.78 --> 01:39:02.66
If you step out of line, guess what's going to happen?

1557
01:39:02.66 --> 01:39:05.02
You're getting the lash.

1558
01:39:05.02 --> 01:39:06.02
You're getting punished.

1559
01:39:06.02 --> 01:39:07.02
You're getting no pay.

1560
01:39:07.02 --> 01:39:09.02
You're getting bread and water.

1561
01:39:09.02 --> 01:39:14.02
So that's what we set up.

1562
01:39:14.02 --> 01:39:18.58
But this incompetence is augmented by another factor, namely the characteristics of some

1563
01:39:18.58 --> 01:39:22.38
of those attracted to the military.

1564
01:39:22.38 --> 01:39:26.38
Let us examine this hypothesis by modern standards and viewed from the outside the nature

1565
01:39:26.38 --> 01:39:32.30
of militarism may not seem very attractive, including as it does, a number of attributes

1566
01:39:32.30 --> 01:39:40.06
which are positively repellent to those who value freedom, egalitarianism, and creative

1567
01:39:40.06 --> 01:39:43.06
as opposed to destructive ends.

1568
01:39:43.06 --> 01:39:47.54
So if you think about what the military is, hey, you're going to follow orders.

1569
01:39:47.54 --> 01:39:50.38
You're going to have to dress the way you get told to dress.

1570
01:39:50.38 --> 01:39:53.14
You're going to have to cut your hair the way you get told to cut your hair.

1571
01:39:53.14 --> 01:39:54.94
You have to wake up when they tell you to wake up.

1572
01:39:54.94 --> 01:39:57.06
You're going to go to bed when they tell you to go to bed.

1573
01:39:57.06 --> 01:40:01.54
If you're a person that values personal freedom, why are you going in there?

1574
01:40:01.54 --> 01:40:03.98
Why is that happening?

1575
01:40:03.98 --> 01:40:07.62
If you want to create things in the world, why are you going in the military?

1576
01:40:07.62 --> 01:40:09.42
You're going to military to destroy things.

1577
01:40:09.42 --> 01:40:14.42
You're going to have to go to the military.

1578
01:40:14.42 --> 01:40:22.38
He said, I would be left to kill people from my country.

1579
01:40:22.38 --> 01:40:32.22
That's attracting a certain person, not someone that wants to create, someone that wants

1580
01:40:32.22 --> 01:40:35.22
to destroy.

1581
01:40:35.22 --> 01:40:40.54
Why then do people join the army and are there some characteristics of the military,

1582
01:40:40.54 --> 01:40:45.94
which have a positively magnetic attraction for those who subsequent performance may be deemed

1583
01:40:45.94 --> 01:40:47.94
incompetent?

1584
01:40:47.94 --> 01:40:49.50
So who we bring it in here?

1585
01:40:49.50 --> 01:40:54.58
He makes a comparison to alcoholics anonymous.

1586
01:40:54.58 --> 01:40:58.22
He says, alcohol anonymous is anonymous.

1587
01:40:58.22 --> 01:41:03.30
Can attract people an individual with particular problems of a psychological kind, maybe

1588
01:41:03.30 --> 01:41:08.30
expect it to gravitate towards a group which he recognizes not only as containing fellow

1589
01:41:08.30 --> 01:41:14.06
softwares, but also as having developed effective ways of dealing with special needs

1590
01:41:14.06 --> 01:41:15.54
of its members.

1591
01:41:15.54 --> 01:41:21.06
The therapeutic gain from such behavior during the Second World War has been noted by Robert

1592
01:41:21.06 --> 01:41:22.06
Holt.

1593
01:41:22.06 --> 01:41:28.42
He wrote, it was a common clinical observation during the war that military service was an

1594
01:41:28.42 --> 01:41:33.02
unusually good environment for men who lacked inner controls.

1595
01:41:33.02 --> 01:41:39.82
The combination of absolute security, a strong institutional parent substitute on whom one

1596
01:41:39.82 --> 01:41:46.02
could lean on obtrusively and socially approved outlets for aggression provided a form

1597
01:41:46.02 --> 01:41:53.18
of social control that allowed impulses to be expressed in acceptable ways.

1598
01:41:53.18 --> 01:41:57.46
By the way, when you join the seal teams, you're joining the seal teams so you can kill

1599
01:41:57.46 --> 01:41:58.46
people.

1600
01:41:58.46 --> 01:42:03.34
Or at a very minimum, you're joining the seal teams knowing that you may have to kill

1601
01:42:03.34 --> 01:42:05.18
people.

1602
01:42:05.18 --> 01:42:08.02
If you're going to join the seal teams, you're going to go through that.

1603
01:42:08.02 --> 01:42:11.74
There's got to be some actual, in my opinion, desire to kill people.

1604
01:42:11.74 --> 01:42:13.74
That's what you want to do.

1605
01:42:13.74 --> 01:42:20.34
Dave, you didn't go in the Marine Corps thinking, hey, I'd like to fly a jet.

1606
01:42:20.34 --> 01:42:22.34
No, you want to fly a jet.

1607
01:42:22.34 --> 01:42:24.46
That's what you want to do.

1608
01:42:24.46 --> 01:42:29.70
This is an acceptable way that you can go fly a jet. Did you want to get in a dogfight?

1609
01:42:29.70 --> 01:42:31.98
Yes.

1610
01:42:31.98 --> 01:42:33.98
What's the outcome of a dogfight?

1611
01:42:33.98 --> 01:42:35.38
Either winter you lose.

1612
01:42:35.38 --> 01:42:38.30
What happens to the looser?

1613
01:42:38.30 --> 01:42:39.30
The loser dies.

1614
01:42:39.30 --> 01:42:41.30
The loser dies.

1615
01:42:41.30 --> 01:42:49.38
Here all these military people are signing up for their aggression to be expressed in an acceptable

1616
01:42:49.38 --> 01:42:50.38
way.

1617
01:42:50.38 --> 01:42:52.98
Surrounding by people who see it the same way.

1618
01:42:52.98 --> 01:42:53.98
That's the thing.

1619
01:42:53.98 --> 01:42:55.58
You look at alcoholics and honest.

1620
01:42:55.58 --> 01:42:57.46
These are the other people deal with.

1621
01:42:57.46 --> 01:42:59.82
And you look at the military, like, what kind of law?

1622
01:42:59.82 --> 01:43:01.22
That sounds like they're cool way to go.

1623
01:43:01.22 --> 01:43:05.74
I also understand why you feel the way you do, why do you think the way you do.

1624
01:43:05.74 --> 01:43:10.02
That scene that you can see, that connection.

1625
01:43:10.02 --> 01:43:13.54
So easy to see that connection.

1626
01:43:13.54 --> 01:43:18.24
He says even a troop of bad boons contrives a rigid dominance hierarchy where in each

1627
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:19.62
male knows its place.

1628
01:43:19.62 --> 01:43:21.02
It's kind of like the military.

1629
01:43:21.02 --> 01:43:26.10
Very nice, getting there and you can see when some people in the military, when they

1630
01:43:26.10 --> 01:43:30.02
win their that bad boon that gets their spot in the hierarchy and they want to flex it on

1631
01:43:30.02 --> 01:43:31.02
everybody.

1632
01:43:31.02 --> 01:43:33.58
You can see those people all day long.

1633
01:43:33.58 --> 01:43:35.42
And again, is this everyone in the military?

1634
01:43:35.42 --> 01:43:36.42
Absolutely not.

1635
01:43:36.42 --> 01:43:37.94
It's absolutely not.

1636
01:43:37.94 --> 01:43:42.50
No, but there's a piece of that formalization of that hierarchy.

1637
01:43:42.50 --> 01:43:44.82
And in the military, I'm sure it's the same way with you.

1638
01:43:44.82 --> 01:43:47.38
There is still an unspoken hierarchy.

1639
01:43:47.38 --> 01:43:52.26
There is a pecking order that isn't written down.

1640
01:43:52.26 --> 01:43:56.18
There's a roster that we don't write on the boon and go, okay, you know, Jocco's one

1641
01:43:56.18 --> 01:43:57.18
echoes two, Dave's three.

1642
01:43:57.18 --> 01:44:00.86
It doesn't say that, but everybody kind of knows this stuff.

1643
01:44:00.86 --> 01:44:04.90
And if it's not pure, there's at least some groups, some catty like a couple guys here

1644
01:44:04.90 --> 01:44:05.90
come guys here.

1645
01:44:05.90 --> 01:44:08.26
And everybody knows it.

1646
01:44:08.26 --> 01:44:17.34
But the system can offset that a little bit by creating, well, utilize that deliberate hierarchy.

1647
01:44:17.34 --> 01:44:22.62
Which means like maybe Dave's like seven kind of sucks.

1648
01:44:22.62 --> 01:44:25.02
But I do whatever I can do.

1649
01:44:25.02 --> 01:44:26.02
I'm maneuvering.

1650
01:44:26.02 --> 01:44:30.34
I actually I get promoted or I get a task or I get actually some deliberate hierarchical

1651
01:44:30.34 --> 01:44:31.34
authority.

1652
01:44:31.34 --> 01:44:32.34
Right.

1653
01:44:32.34 --> 01:44:36.18
And now I can kind of like, now you know why revenge can get past.

1654
01:44:36.18 --> 01:44:39.74
Yes, because I hate, hey, we all know where I was, but that was unwritten, but I'm

1655
01:44:39.74 --> 01:44:41.38
in charge now.

1656
01:44:41.38 --> 01:44:47.30
And then the psychology of that power, which sort of fixes the problem with the unspoken

1657
01:44:47.30 --> 01:44:51.54
hierarchy, and the things on the, you know, in that, you know, those bad boys don't have a chart.

1658
01:44:51.54 --> 01:44:53.10
They just know.

1659
01:44:53.10 --> 01:44:56.02
And there's nothing that number seven's going to do to go, well, I got a formal piece over

1660
01:44:56.02 --> 01:44:59.62
here that sort of allows me to impose my will on you.

1661
01:44:59.62 --> 01:45:03.94
And I mean, I've been writing things on self esteem ego, the 20 different versions of that

1662
01:45:03.94 --> 01:45:07.98
word that he's used so far in this book, which all comes down to the insecurity, all those

1663
01:45:07.98 --> 01:45:09.86
different words that he's using.

1664
01:45:09.86 --> 01:45:16.42
The military delivers some authority for the people that have that that is kind of undeniable

1665
01:45:16.42 --> 01:45:17.42
in the system.

1666
01:45:17.42 --> 01:45:21.86
And again, not everybody, just like you said, this is not everybody, but it is there.

1667
01:45:21.86 --> 01:45:23.10
It is there.

1668
01:45:23.10 --> 01:45:30.98
There's, there's nothing worse than when somebody who thinks they should be in charge,

1669
01:45:30.98 --> 01:45:32.98
actually gets in charge.

1670
01:45:32.98 --> 01:45:36.38
Those people are the worst.

1671
01:45:36.38 --> 01:45:40.30
The people that sit there and think, churches are just fuming.

1672
01:45:40.30 --> 01:45:44.18
They're thinking, Archbishop, I can do such a much better job and they're, what their

1673
01:45:44.18 --> 01:45:49.86
thoughts are and when they actually get put in charge, they're a freaking disaster, they're

1674
01:45:49.86 --> 01:45:50.86
nightmare.

1675
01:45:50.86 --> 01:45:56.22
Oh, they become the head baboon.

1676
01:45:56.22 --> 01:46:01.70
As at a human level, armies resemble the authoritarian family group, just as the ethos

1677
01:46:01.70 --> 01:46:06.10
of an upper class Victorian family totally forbade any show of aggression by the child

1678
01:46:06.10 --> 01:46:07.70
toward its parents.

1679
01:46:07.70 --> 01:46:14.14
But encouraged, organized, aggression towards contemporaries in such school pursuits as boxing

1680
01:46:14.14 --> 01:46:16.14
and sanctioned a bullying.

1681
01:46:16.14 --> 01:46:21.14
So in the army, the slightest hint of in-subordination, I.E. aggression directed towards

1682
01:46:21.14 --> 01:46:26.26
superior, is severely punished while aggression towards the enemy is encouraged and rewarded.

1683
01:46:26.26 --> 01:46:28.26
Got to set that up.

1684
01:46:28.26 --> 01:46:36.18
Got to keep it under control from a psychological point of view, therefore militarism strives

1685
01:46:36.18 --> 01:46:43.62
to maintain that paradoxical state of affairs where feeling angry may well be totally split

1686
01:46:43.62 --> 01:46:45.46
off from aggression.

1687
01:46:45.46 --> 01:46:50.86
One in which a soldier is required to suppress his aggression towards his superiors whom he

1688
01:46:50.86 --> 01:46:58.18
may loath while venting it upon a hypothetical enemy towards whom he well may well entertain

1689
01:46:58.18 --> 01:47:02.54
no hostile feelings.

1690
01:47:02.54 --> 01:47:07.66
The class example of this on Orthodox behavior occurred on Christmas Day, 1914, when British

1691
01:47:07.66 --> 01:47:14.66
and German troops joined together for convivialities in no man's land.

1692
01:47:14.66 --> 01:47:17.22
This guy's vocabulary is very impressive, by the way.

1693
01:47:17.22 --> 01:47:22.38
Needless to say, these reprehensible flickering of humanity were quickly stamped out by the

1694
01:47:22.38 --> 01:47:23.78
generals on both sides.

1695
01:47:23.78 --> 01:47:25.38
We all know what happened.

1696
01:47:25.38 --> 01:47:27.62
The Germans and the Brets were like, we're not fighting anymore.

1697
01:47:27.62 --> 01:47:28.62
We're not playing soccer.

1698
01:47:28.62 --> 01:47:29.62
We're not playing soccer.

1699
01:47:29.62 --> 01:47:32.98
And then the generals like, no, you will bomb them.

1700
01:47:32.98 --> 01:47:35.58
They'll Roger that.

1701
01:47:35.58 --> 01:47:41.66
It is just because the business of a soldier is destruction and violence that need to take

1702
01:47:41.66 --> 01:47:46.62
general precautions against disorder becomes so pressing.

1703
01:47:46.62 --> 01:47:51.90
Because you really, you got a bunch of freaking, you're training people to be aggressive.

1704
01:47:51.90 --> 01:47:55.06
And you've got to somehow make sure they don't point that aggression at you.

1705
01:47:55.06 --> 01:48:01.02
The aspects and question may be assumed under the general, effinkly impolite heading

1706
01:48:01.02 --> 01:48:02.70
of bullshit.

1707
01:48:02.70 --> 01:48:06.78
So important is this curious phenomenon that it deserves a section to itself.

1708
01:48:06.78 --> 01:48:10.02
So now we have a chapter that's called bullshit, which I already mentioned.

1709
01:48:10.02 --> 01:48:13.34
This is the little stupid things that you're doing.

1710
01:48:13.34 --> 01:48:18.54
So this is covered in this next section, this next chapter, which is entitled bullshit,

1711
01:48:18.54 --> 01:48:21.06
chicken shit, whatever.

1712
01:48:21.06 --> 01:48:27.54
According to Eric Partridge, the word was coined by Australian soldiers in 1916 coming

1713
01:48:27.54 --> 01:48:31.94
from a country whose armed forces have always been relatively free from this element of

1714
01:48:31.94 --> 01:48:32.94
militarism.

1715
01:48:32.94 --> 01:48:36.66
They were evidently so struck by the excessive spit and polish of the British army that

1716
01:48:36.66 --> 01:48:40.34
they felt moved to give it a label.

1717
01:48:40.34 --> 01:48:46.06
Going a little further back at his possible at the expression has its origin in a bull,

1718
01:48:46.06 --> 01:48:51.26
the false hairpiece worn by women between 69,000, 1770.

1719
01:48:51.26 --> 01:48:56.66
This would be consistent with the fact that modern dictionaries defined bull as quote,

1720
01:48:56.66 --> 01:49:03.48
a ludicrous, just, a self-contradictory statement to cheat, empty talk, absurd, fussiness,

1721
01:49:03.48 --> 01:49:05.82
overdress, and quote.

1722
01:49:05.82 --> 01:49:11.10
Whatever its etymological significance, such definitions certainly capture the military

1723
01:49:11.10 --> 01:49:16.86
nature of bull, one of the most astonishing, apparently irrational, and yet significant

1724
01:49:16.86 --> 01:49:23.10
aspects of militarism, one which connotes an attitude of mind, a pattern of behavior as

1725
01:49:23.10 --> 01:49:25.62
and an end product.

1726
01:49:25.62 --> 01:49:32.58
As implied by the old jingle, quote, if it moves, salute it, if it doesn't move, pick

1727
01:49:32.58 --> 01:49:37.70
it up, if you can't pick it up, paint it and quote.

1728
01:49:37.70 --> 01:49:43.82
The phenomenon involves ritualistic observance of the dominant submission, relationships

1729
01:49:43.82 --> 01:49:50.34
of the military hierarchy, extreme orderliness, and a preoccupation without word appearances.

1730
01:49:50.34 --> 01:49:51.74
This is what we call chicken chicken.

1731
01:49:51.74 --> 01:49:55.98
The term painting rocks comes from the Marine Corps, right?

1732
01:49:55.98 --> 01:49:56.98
I think so.

1733
01:49:56.98 --> 01:49:58.26
I've heard that, Kermit 1000 grams.

1734
01:49:58.26 --> 01:50:02.58
I can't say that I know for sure, but I think that's right.

1735
01:50:02.58 --> 01:50:07.90
I can definitely say I have seen way more white painted rocks on the Marine Corps bases than

1736
01:50:07.90 --> 01:50:10.90
any other base.

1737
01:50:10.90 --> 01:50:11.90
Right.

1738
01:50:11.90 --> 01:50:15.22
So does it mean they'll take rocks and paint them white in black color and white.

1739
01:50:15.22 --> 01:50:16.22
Oh, I'm like bullshit.

1740
01:50:16.22 --> 01:50:17.22
How about you, kiddo?

1741
01:50:17.22 --> 01:50:22.70
It's rock, kiddo, I'm like the paint is a rocks before.

1742
01:50:22.70 --> 01:50:24.34
He's painted some rocks.

1743
01:50:24.34 --> 01:50:32.18
So in the military manifestations of bold range from such minor apparent absurdities as

1744
01:50:32.18 --> 01:50:34.90
the polishing of the backs of cap badges.

1745
01:50:34.90 --> 01:50:38.10
So what that means echo is you're polishing something that's never going to be seen.

1746
01:50:38.10 --> 01:50:40.02
But someone's going to inspect it.

1747
01:50:40.02 --> 01:50:42.90
It can't be seen, but you're going to do it.

1748
01:50:42.90 --> 01:50:50.30
The blanking of trees for forthcoming general general inspection, I look up blanking because

1749
01:50:50.30 --> 01:50:51.74
I didn't know what it was.

1750
01:50:51.74 --> 01:50:59.30
So blanko was like a powder paint that they used to issue so you could camouflage things.

1751
01:50:59.30 --> 01:51:03.22
But eventually, of course, took it to the extreme and now we want all the trees to be the

1752
01:51:03.22 --> 01:51:04.22
same color.

1753
01:51:04.22 --> 01:51:07.66
So we're going to mix this powder paint, which is a military thing and we're going to paint

1754
01:51:07.66 --> 01:51:08.66
the trees.

1755
01:51:08.66 --> 01:51:10.78
So they're all going to be whatever gray.

1756
01:51:10.78 --> 01:51:15.66
That's the kind of that's chicken shit stuff going on right there.

1757
01:51:15.66 --> 01:51:21.14
Besides this emphasis on appearance and its constraining aspects of bullshit also involves

1758
01:51:21.14 --> 01:51:23.50
a compulsive concern with cleanliness.

1759
01:51:23.50 --> 01:51:28.66
In this respect alone, it may achieve impressive levels of irrationality to make it white.

1760
01:51:28.66 --> 01:51:33.02
Webbing equipment might be boiled almost to the point of destruction while the blankets

1761
01:51:33.02 --> 01:51:36.98
at one sleep that the owner sleeps in stay on washed for weeks.

1762
01:51:36.98 --> 01:51:39.54
There are, of course, good arguments for bullshit.

1763
01:51:39.54 --> 01:51:42.66
So here's some reasons why it exists, some of the positive reasons.

1764
01:51:42.66 --> 01:51:48.58
It ensures a level of alreadyness, orderliness, cleanliness, discipline, personal pride, obedience,

1765
01:51:48.58 --> 01:51:53.62
and morale, which so it seems could not be reached in any other means, I.e. by reasoned

1766
01:51:53.62 --> 01:51:56.14
as opposed to compulsive behavior.

1767
01:51:56.14 --> 01:52:00.58
By the same token, it achieves a level of uniformity that makes for solidarity and group

1768
01:52:00.58 --> 01:52:01.58
cohesiveness.

1769
01:52:01.58 --> 01:52:04.34
So there's some good reasons for it.

1770
01:52:04.34 --> 01:52:06.22
However, the case against it is also strong.

1771
01:52:06.22 --> 01:52:11.34
It's time wasting, excruciatingly boring for all those with more than the most mediocre

1772
01:52:11.34 --> 01:52:14.54
intellect and a poor substitute for thought.

1773
01:52:14.54 --> 01:52:19.38
Since it aims to govern behavior by a set of rules and defines a rigid program for different

1774
01:52:19.38 --> 01:52:23.14
occasions, it cannot meet the unanticipated event.

1775
01:52:23.14 --> 01:52:28.02
So you're getting trained not to think, you want to do, did you go to OCS?

1776
01:52:28.02 --> 01:52:29.02
Yeah.

1777
01:52:29.02 --> 01:52:30.02
Okay.

1778
01:52:30.02 --> 01:52:31.90
When I went to Navy OCS, the belt buckle that we got.

1779
01:52:31.90 --> 01:52:36.42
We had to polish the coating off. There's a coating that comes on the belt buckle's

1780
01:52:36.42 --> 01:52:37.62
echoed Charles.

1781
01:52:37.62 --> 01:52:39.46
That keeps it shiny.

1782
01:52:39.46 --> 01:52:42.38
No matter what, like you can, it's going to keep shiny.

1783
01:52:42.38 --> 01:52:45.66
You actually polish that off.

1784
01:52:45.66 --> 01:52:51.90
So that it can get eroded so that you have to polish it more.

1785
01:52:51.90 --> 01:52:53.14
That's some chicken shit.

1786
01:52:53.14 --> 01:52:55.02
Some bullshit right there.

1787
01:52:55.02 --> 01:52:58.78
We had anodized and non-anodized.

1788
01:52:58.78 --> 01:53:02.90
Anodized is the permanent thing that is always brass or shiny.

1789
01:53:02.90 --> 01:53:05.86
You are not a lot of, you have anodized gear.

1790
01:53:05.86 --> 01:53:08.54
So all of your stuff, your belt buckle's everything.

1791
01:53:08.54 --> 01:53:09.98
None of it could be anodized.

1792
01:53:09.98 --> 01:53:12.66
That was reserved for like some other people.

1793
01:53:12.66 --> 01:53:16.78
And so you had to, by the unanodized and then shiny to make it look like it was.

1794
01:53:16.78 --> 01:53:17.78
Yes.

1795
01:53:17.78 --> 01:53:18.78
Good use of time.

1796
01:53:18.78 --> 01:53:21.34
Wait, we had to, man you were, yeah, unanodized.

1797
01:53:21.34 --> 01:53:22.78
Right, it's the freaking belt buckle's.

1798
01:53:22.78 --> 01:53:27.10
And next level, you could see it slowly coming off and you sitting there with a cotton swab

1799
01:53:27.10 --> 01:53:29.70
and just hours.

1800
01:53:29.70 --> 01:53:31.22
See, even echo's confused by this.

1801
01:53:31.22 --> 01:53:32.22
Yes, kind of nonsense.

1802
01:53:32.22 --> 01:53:33.22
It's total nonsense.

1803
01:53:33.22 --> 01:53:34.22
It's called brass.

1804
01:53:34.22 --> 01:53:35.22
Oh, brass.

1805
01:53:35.22 --> 01:53:36.22
Yeah, you definitely use brass.

1806
01:53:36.22 --> 01:53:37.22
That's what got it off.

1807
01:53:37.22 --> 01:53:39.22
Right.

1808
01:53:39.22 --> 01:53:47.46
Like any compulsive symptom, bull shit and it's cousins, ritual, dogma and superstition have

1809
01:53:47.46 --> 01:53:52.54
put themselves so far beyond reason thought that they could, that they create resistance

1810
01:53:52.54 --> 01:53:54.78
to change and the acceptance of new ideas.

1811
01:53:54.78 --> 01:53:56.02
Take military drill.

1812
01:53:56.02 --> 01:53:59.46
This starts as a skill adapted to a reality situation.

1813
01:53:59.46 --> 01:54:00.46
Right.

1814
01:54:00.46 --> 01:54:03.10
We used to have to do close order drill for combat.

1815
01:54:03.10 --> 01:54:07.54
It develops into a rigid pattern of behavior by becoming automatic takes the load off

1816
01:54:07.54 --> 01:54:08.54
of memory.

1817
01:54:08.54 --> 01:54:10.02
So you drill that and we still do this today.

1818
01:54:10.02 --> 01:54:13.30
You don't call it military drill, but when you're doing immediate action drills with

1819
01:54:13.30 --> 01:54:17.14
your weapon, you're learning how to wrap tack and bang, you're learning how to solve problems

1820
01:54:17.14 --> 01:54:18.74
without having to think about them.

1821
01:54:18.74 --> 01:54:20.34
Takes the load off the memory.

1822
01:54:20.34 --> 01:54:25.82
Once learned, it is, it is directed by processes of which we are scarcely conscious

1823
01:54:25.82 --> 01:54:30.46
and which leave the limited channel capacity of conscious experience, mercifully free to deal

1824
01:54:30.46 --> 01:54:32.18
with other more pressing events.

1825
01:54:32.18 --> 01:54:36.34
That's why you can reload your weapon without having to think about it and that way you can

1826
01:54:36.34 --> 01:54:38.70
figure out where I'm going to maneuver my element to last.

1827
01:54:38.70 --> 01:54:40.42
Next, that's drill.

1828
01:54:40.42 --> 01:54:41.74
That's good.

1829
01:54:41.74 --> 01:54:46.70
It is drill in such a sense which ensures that most motorists let off the handbrake

1830
01:54:46.70 --> 01:54:51.42
before engaging the clutch and that most speakers construct their sentences according to the

1831
01:54:51.42 --> 01:54:52.42
rules of language.

1832
01:54:52.42 --> 01:54:53.42
Right.

1833
01:54:53.42 --> 01:54:54.42
We don't have to think about that military drill.

1834
01:54:54.42 --> 01:55:01.34
This way, the devices which could eventually weld together a group of uneducated peasants

1835
01:55:01.34 --> 01:55:05.62
into a single corporate machine that did what it was told.

1836
01:55:05.62 --> 01:55:07.42
This was all good except for one thing.

1837
01:55:07.42 --> 01:55:11.54
Ritualization implying the tendency to transform means to an ends.

1838
01:55:11.54 --> 01:55:15.26
Thus the battle drill of one error becomes the ceremonial drill of another.

1839
01:55:15.26 --> 01:55:19.86
What started out as a functionally useful maneuver becomes a highly stereotyped pattern of

1840
01:55:19.86 --> 01:55:22.38
movements on the barracks square.

1841
01:55:22.38 --> 01:55:26.30
And itself, this may be no bad thing.

1842
01:55:26.30 --> 01:55:27.30
So this is where these things come from.

1843
01:55:27.30 --> 01:55:28.94
That's where they came from.

1844
01:55:28.94 --> 01:55:34.02
When you see the people doing the closer to drill, like the Marine Corps silent drill team,

1845
01:55:34.02 --> 01:55:37.18
it used to have a purpose.

1846
01:55:37.18 --> 01:55:38.94
And it's not a bad thing necessarily.

1847
01:55:38.94 --> 01:55:45.42
Ceremonial can be pleasing to the eye and anoddine for taxpayers and even on occasions

1848
01:55:45.42 --> 01:55:47.38
a device for raising charitable funds.

1849
01:55:47.38 --> 01:55:49.70
Dude, you're talking about the blue angels.

1850
01:55:49.70 --> 01:55:50.70
The hundred percent.

1851
01:55:50.70 --> 01:55:51.70
Yeah.

1852
01:55:51.70 --> 01:55:55.14
And I mean that in like you subscribe in a good way.

1853
01:55:55.14 --> 01:55:56.14
Right.

1854
01:55:56.14 --> 01:55:57.14
That's a good way.

1855
01:55:57.14 --> 01:56:00.46
And it's based on at one point, hey, we're going to fly together.

1856
01:56:00.46 --> 01:56:02.46
My wingman's going to be a cup, you know, whatever.

1857
01:56:02.46 --> 01:56:03.46
Very close to me.

1858
01:56:03.46 --> 01:56:07.38
But now we're going to take what is there seven of them flying at the sun?

1859
01:56:07.38 --> 01:56:08.38
Six.

1860
01:56:08.38 --> 01:56:10.62
Now we're going to take six aircraft where we three inches from each other.

1861
01:56:10.62 --> 01:56:13.22
And it's taken to the extreme.

1862
01:56:13.22 --> 01:56:14.22
And it has some benefits.

1863
01:56:14.22 --> 01:56:16.02
It's going to recruit people.

1864
01:56:16.02 --> 01:56:19.10
It's going to be the taxpayers can see that we've got something.

1865
01:56:19.10 --> 01:56:20.42
And we can raise money.

1866
01:56:20.42 --> 01:56:22.94
So it's positive thing.

1867
01:56:22.94 --> 01:56:26.26
But unfortunately, Ceremonial drill like other forms of bullshit is addictive.

1868
01:56:26.26 --> 01:56:30.46
And by being so who serves the time and energy, which should be devoted to other more

1869
01:56:30.46 --> 01:56:36.46
adaptive pastimes, it then becomes a substitute for doing something else as when the conservative

1870
01:56:36.46 --> 01:56:42.42
element in the brigade of guards resisted the adopting of new battle drill because it would

1871
01:56:42.42 --> 01:56:45.30
interfere with their existing Ceremonial procedures.

1872
01:56:45.30 --> 01:56:49.26
So now we're starting to say, hey, we can't do that because that's not how we do our

1873
01:56:49.26 --> 01:56:52.26
Ceremonial stuff.

1874
01:56:52.26 --> 01:56:55.34
Fast forward a little bit as a factor in fighting efficiency.

1875
01:56:55.34 --> 01:56:58.42
Bull has also been unhelpful in the Navy.

1876
01:56:58.42 --> 01:57:03.98
If we were, if we assume that one of the main purposes of the Navy is to defeat the enemy,

1877
01:57:03.98 --> 01:57:08.98
and that is in the past anyway achieved by shell fire, it might be supposed that much

1878
01:57:08.98 --> 01:57:12.06
time would have been spent on practicing gunnery.

1879
01:57:12.06 --> 01:57:15.66
But in the British Navy in the years before the first World War, ship commanders were

1880
01:57:15.66 --> 01:57:21.22
actively discouraged from gunnery practice because the smoke might mark the paintwork and

1881
01:57:21.22 --> 01:57:24.02
soil the gleaming decks.

1882
01:57:24.02 --> 01:57:27.18
The price for this was paid at Jutland.

1883
01:57:27.18 --> 01:57:31.42
Did you, when did you came in the Marine Corps in what 1994?

1884
01:57:31.42 --> 01:57:32.42
Commission 94.

1885
01:57:32.42 --> 01:57:33.42
Commission 94.

1886
01:57:33.42 --> 01:57:37.42
Did you start your camis?

1887
01:57:37.42 --> 01:57:39.42
Oh yeah.

1888
01:57:39.42 --> 01:57:41.42
I got into the era of starch.

1889
01:57:41.42 --> 01:57:42.42
Okay.

1890
01:57:42.42 --> 01:57:43.98
I started before we, we obviously don't do that anymore.

1891
01:57:43.98 --> 01:57:45.62
I'll go back in the memory banks.

1892
01:57:45.62 --> 01:57:47.26
Yes, totally.

1893
01:57:47.26 --> 01:57:52.38
We starched our food camis in the seal teams for almost my entire career.

1894
01:57:52.38 --> 01:57:54.38
You had a pair of starch camis.

1895
01:57:54.38 --> 01:57:55.38
Yes.

1896
01:57:55.38 --> 01:57:59.02
And I remember when the Marine Corps at one point they stopped starching, I was like, they

1897
01:57:59.02 --> 01:58:00.30
are so freaking square away.

1898
01:58:00.30 --> 01:58:01.30
Yes.

1899
01:58:01.30 --> 01:58:05.94
And I remember that time, I mean, you had your set of starched inspection ready camis.

1900
01:58:05.94 --> 01:58:09.14
And when you brought them in, they would ask you the level of starch that you want.

1901
01:58:09.14 --> 01:58:10.14
Yes.

1902
01:58:10.14 --> 01:58:11.14
And you'd say galactic.

1903
01:58:11.14 --> 01:58:12.14
Yeah.

1904
01:58:12.14 --> 01:58:14.78
I don't want to be able to move.

1905
01:58:14.78 --> 01:58:16.58
I want this to be body armor.

1906
01:58:16.58 --> 01:58:20.22
I had starch camis that would stop a freaking 7, 6, 2 by 3rd time.

1907
01:58:20.22 --> 01:58:24.94
I thought that when you said it because we went away from a pretty, pretty war.

1908
01:58:24.94 --> 01:58:25.94
Right.

1909
01:58:25.94 --> 01:58:26.94
It was prewar.

1910
01:58:26.94 --> 01:58:27.94
Yeah, so I was working on that.

1911
01:58:27.94 --> 01:58:28.94
That's even more impressive.

1912
01:58:28.94 --> 01:58:29.94
Yes.

1913
01:58:29.94 --> 01:58:32.10
I could see him doing it after September 11th, maybe two years later, be like,

1914
01:58:32.10 --> 01:58:33.38
all right, we got a freaking stop.

1915
01:58:33.38 --> 01:58:37.74
These, no, you actually did it before the war started, which shows you somebody, this

1916
01:58:37.74 --> 01:58:39.46
is why we know we have some good officers out there.

1917
01:58:39.46 --> 01:58:40.46
Right.

1918
01:58:40.46 --> 01:58:43.42
Because somebody looked and said, wait, why am I seeing this freaking, they lands corporal over

1919
01:58:43.42 --> 01:58:45.70
here and it starts to get a camis.

1920
01:58:45.70 --> 01:58:49.58
And I feel like overdo it on this, but that piece you said is actually really important.

1921
01:58:49.58 --> 01:58:53.18
And using that example is a good example because the new camis, the Marine Corps got, not

1922
01:58:53.18 --> 01:58:57.82
only within outstarts, they were designed to be washed and not even ironed, which was

1923
01:58:57.82 --> 01:59:03.74
somebody going, hey, ironing your camis is dumb.

1924
01:59:03.74 --> 01:59:05.98
And it takes a long time.

1925
01:59:05.98 --> 01:59:09.18
And we're going down the path of we're going to start measuring Marines based on how well

1926
01:59:09.18 --> 01:59:12.34
they iron their camis, which is a skill that I don't care about.

1927
01:59:12.34 --> 01:59:13.34
Yes.

1928
01:59:13.34 --> 01:59:17.86
And just no more starratives, you can take them out of the wash and flat, you know, slap

1929
01:59:17.86 --> 01:59:19.58
them out and put them on.

1930
01:59:19.58 --> 01:59:21.34
And they weren't going to go in and look at crap.

1931
01:59:21.34 --> 01:59:23.86
And it is the example of what you just described.

1932
01:59:23.86 --> 01:59:26.26
It was like there actually some good people going, this is stupid.

1933
01:59:26.26 --> 01:59:27.90
This is chicken shit and we're not doing this.

1934
01:59:27.90 --> 01:59:29.26
Yes, that is outstanding.

1935
01:59:29.26 --> 01:59:32.02
Also, somebody that needs to be a chicken shit review board.

1936
01:59:32.02 --> 01:59:36.34
If I was benevolent dictator of America, I would have a chicken shit review board for each

1937
01:59:36.34 --> 01:59:41.14
branch of the service and then I'd have a chief chicken shit review board officer who would

1938
01:59:41.14 --> 01:59:46.14
be like a Mustang freaking UDT guy from NAMM.

1939
01:59:46.14 --> 01:59:51.50
Also, when I came in, the Marine Corps, there was no name tags.

1940
01:59:51.50 --> 01:59:52.90
Did you, did you, were you in that air?

1941
01:59:52.90 --> 01:59:53.90
That was.

1942
01:59:53.90 --> 01:59:56.42
So you were just, you were just staff sergeant.

1943
01:59:56.42 --> 01:59:57.94
What was your name?

1944
01:59:57.94 --> 01:59:59.10
My name is staff sergeant.

1945
01:59:59.10 --> 02:00:00.38
You can just call me staff sergeant.

1946
02:00:00.38 --> 02:00:02.38
That was, that was freaking outstanding.

1947
02:00:02.38 --> 02:00:05.38
That was pretty cool.

1948
02:00:05.38 --> 02:00:06.38
Fast forward a little bit.

1949
02:00:06.38 --> 02:00:09.82
Now that we have touched upon some of the more obvious manifestations of the phenomenon.

1950
02:00:09.82 --> 02:00:14.06
Let us examine its deeper causes and relevance to the central thesis of this book.

1951
02:00:14.06 --> 02:00:16.50
Okay, so why is this chicken shit come from?

1952
02:00:16.50 --> 02:00:21.78
First start, it seems to be a natural product of a authoritarian, hierarchical, or organizations.

1953
02:00:21.78 --> 02:00:27.34
Secondly, though it's outward and visible signs are manifold, they have three common denominators.

1954
02:00:27.34 --> 02:00:30.14
The first is constraint.

1955
02:00:30.14 --> 02:00:32.14
We're trying to constrain people.

1956
02:00:32.14 --> 02:00:35.90
The second is deception, which sounds a little bit weird.

1957
02:00:35.90 --> 02:00:39.42
The third is substitution for thought.

1958
02:00:39.42 --> 02:00:45.14
The deception part is like, oh, we can have you do this instead of doing something else.

1959
02:00:45.14 --> 02:00:47.66
The constraint is we're going to control you in the substitution for thought is we don't

1960
02:00:47.66 --> 02:00:49.30
want you thinking.

1961
02:00:49.30 --> 02:00:52.06
Fast forward a little bit here.

1962
02:00:52.06 --> 02:01:00.90
Perhaps the single most important feature of bull is its capacity to delay anxiety.

1963
02:01:00.90 --> 02:01:03.98
So, and I'm just going to get into it.

1964
02:01:03.98 --> 02:01:10.22
At conscious rational level, or greed or delineus, cleanliness, punctuality, and discipline,

1965
02:01:10.22 --> 02:01:14.94
clearly make for efficiency, the knowledge that one belongs to an organization which

1966
02:01:14.94 --> 02:01:21.02
puts a premium on these laudable traits that ones rifle or fire, and there is a key for

1967
02:01:21.02 --> 02:01:24.82
the bully beef tin obviously makes for confidence.

1968
02:01:24.82 --> 02:01:30.34
So these are really positive things about this level of discipline.

1969
02:01:30.34 --> 02:01:34.74
At a conscious rational level, therefore, even those aspects of bull, which reflect the

1970
02:01:34.74 --> 02:01:39.94
grossest exaggeration of these traits, must seem like steps in the right direction.

1971
02:01:39.94 --> 02:01:44.10
This confidence, of course, may be displaced.

1972
02:01:44.10 --> 02:01:48.10
That a commander insists upon meticulous attention to detail down to the last shining

1973
02:01:48.10 --> 02:01:55.18
button is no guarantee that his strategic thinking is anything other than pure aisle.

1974
02:01:55.18 --> 02:02:02.58
Indeed, he could well be unwittingly substituting a lesser for a more important area of

1975
02:02:02.58 --> 02:02:04.02
general ship.

1976
02:02:04.02 --> 02:02:06.02
That's the substituting part.

1977
02:02:06.02 --> 02:02:11.14
Look, as we were saying earlier, Dave, I might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but

1978
02:02:11.14 --> 02:02:15.98
if I can polish this belt buckle and I can put on this uniform and I can get my platoon

1979
02:02:15.98 --> 02:02:21.02
to do all that correctly, I'm going to look good.

1980
02:02:21.02 --> 02:02:25.50
Nevertheless, there are good grounds for believing that those situations in which bulls

1981
02:02:25.50 --> 02:02:33.34
shed flourishes are ones in which it reduces anxiety because orderliness is fairly vital

1982
02:02:33.34 --> 02:02:34.74
to survival.

1983
02:02:34.74 --> 02:02:39.34
Again, the imposed uniformity, which is part and partial of the bulls, should obviously

1984
02:02:39.34 --> 02:02:43.98
make for group cohesiveness and that we're all in it together feeling which combat's

1985
02:02:43.98 --> 02:02:45.18
fear.

1986
02:02:45.18 --> 02:02:50.14
We must suppose to, that the heightened conformity which it imposes will, like other forms

1987
02:02:50.14 --> 02:02:54.70
of perceived conformity, encourage people through a diffusion of responsibility to perform

1988
02:02:54.70 --> 02:02:56.86
acts which they might otherwise avoid.

1989
02:02:56.86 --> 02:03:01.18
So we've built a team and we've used this to build a team which is okay.

1990
02:03:01.18 --> 02:03:04.82
I have a common bond with people that went through OCS that we sat around and Pauls these

1991
02:03:04.82 --> 02:03:05.82
things.

1992
02:03:05.82 --> 02:03:08.98
It's a real thing.

1993
02:03:08.98 --> 02:03:12.86
Yet another useful feature of bulls shed and so it has been said as its role as a

1994
02:03:12.86 --> 02:03:17.26
distractor and time filler according to this theory a mind preoccupied with buttons and

1995
02:03:17.26 --> 02:03:20.98
cocaps has little room for gloomy for bootings.

1996
02:03:20.98 --> 02:03:27.34
The point is well made by AB Campbell when writing of naval customs quote, it is the guiding

1997
02:03:27.34 --> 02:03:31.10
principle of naval service that the ships company should be constantly employed and this

1998
02:03:31.10 --> 02:03:36.98
is the reason apart from the necessity for scrupulous, cleanliness, why there is so much scrubbing

1999
02:03:36.98 --> 02:03:38.90
of decks and polishing of bright work.

2000
02:03:38.90 --> 02:03:44.38
There's making people have dumb shit to do because we want the groups to be troops to

2001
02:03:44.38 --> 02:03:45.38
be busy.

2002
02:03:45.38 --> 02:03:50.30
In the same context this writer compares naval and civilian routine.

2003
02:03:50.30 --> 02:03:52.22
There's a reason I read this whole section.

2004
02:03:52.22 --> 02:03:58.94
It is safe to say that there are many jobs, many short job routine routines which destroy

2005
02:03:58.94 --> 02:04:00.42
initiative.

2006
02:04:00.42 --> 02:04:04.50
This also applies to many factory workers but it's not so in the Navy.

2007
02:04:04.50 --> 02:04:09.82
A routine job builds up a blue jacket's character as to why the end quote, as to why the

2008
02:04:09.82 --> 02:04:14.78
naval and civilian characters should require such a dramatically different treatments, Campbell

2009
02:04:14.78 --> 02:04:19.54
refers to the moments of danger which occur for the former but not the later.

2010
02:04:19.54 --> 02:04:23.42
Later, this begs of course, several questions.

2011
02:04:23.42 --> 02:04:31.62
He said this writer is saying that in the Navy all this bullshit work builds character,

2012
02:04:31.62 --> 02:04:36.10
but in this civilian world they don't need it.

2013
02:04:36.10 --> 02:04:39.46
They don't need it and it it it it it it hurts their initiative.

2014
02:04:39.46 --> 02:04:44.10
The reason that it's okay is because in the Navy you've got to face all these threats

2015
02:04:44.10 --> 02:04:46.70
danger.

2016
02:04:46.70 --> 02:04:50.50
He says it confuses loss of initiative and blind obedience with the building of character

2017
02:04:50.50 --> 02:04:54.86
and makes the unwanted assumption that naval ratings face greater danger than many civilians

2018
02:04:54.86 --> 02:05:00.26
including merchant seamen, steeple jacks, racing motorists, mountain climbers, single handed

2019
02:05:00.26 --> 02:05:05.14
yachtmen, coal miners, madda doors, not one of whom has to fortify his character by

2020
02:05:05.14 --> 02:05:08.58
polishing grass or scrubbing wood.

2021
02:05:08.58 --> 02:05:16.22
It would perhaps be true to say that since the imposing of bull upon troops serves to reduce

2022
02:05:16.22 --> 02:05:21.10
initiative it will thereby increase the feeling of dependency which they have toward their

2023
02:05:21.10 --> 02:05:26.58
superiors this in turn will increase their obedience and loyalty.

2024
02:05:26.58 --> 02:05:29.90
So we're getting a little brain washing going on.

2025
02:05:29.90 --> 02:05:30.98
You do what I tell you to do.

2026
02:05:30.98 --> 02:05:32.26
You do it over and over again.

2027
02:05:32.26 --> 02:05:36.02
You become dependent on me telling you what to do and that's what I want.

2028
02:05:36.02 --> 02:05:37.78
I don't want to have any initiative.

2029
02:05:37.78 --> 02:05:39.02
I don't want you thinking for yourself.

2030
02:05:39.02 --> 02:05:40.94
I just want you doing what I tell you to do.

2031
02:05:40.94 --> 02:05:46.74
That's why when I am a tyrannical leader or a authoritarian leader I'm super concerned

2032
02:05:46.74 --> 02:05:52.78
about your freaking buttons.

2033
02:05:52.78 --> 02:05:58.62
Finally at a conscious rational level there are aspects of bull which may well help combat

2034
02:05:58.62 --> 02:06:03.94
social anxieties and military men, gorgeous uniforms, martial music, prancing horses

2035
02:06:03.94 --> 02:06:10.14
and even being saluted are obviously bomb to tender egos and by promoting soldier repried

2036
02:06:10.14 --> 02:06:15.22
do much to offset the hostility and ridicule to which the military are from time to time

2037
02:06:15.22 --> 02:06:21.14
subjected to by those in other walks of life.

2038
02:06:21.14 --> 02:06:24.74
But there's another less obvious reason for bull namely that it serves to reduce

2039
02:06:24.74 --> 02:06:30.34
deeper seated feelings of anxiety which may well have their origins in events unrelated

2040
02:06:30.34 --> 02:06:35.10
to here and now of which the subject remains blissfully unaware.

2041
02:06:35.10 --> 02:06:38.90
This is where we start to get a little psychological reference there that we have things

2042
02:06:38.90 --> 02:06:43.14
in our subconscious that make us a certain way and one of the things he's saying is people

2043
02:06:43.14 --> 02:06:48.82
that people that like things to be super orderly, super or orderly they don't like

2044
02:06:48.82 --> 02:06:51.78
change, they don't like when bad things happen, they don't like when things that you can't

2045
02:06:51.78 --> 02:06:53.90
control, they don't like those things.

2046
02:06:53.90 --> 02:06:56.82
And we're going to get to this but kind of person you want the military someone that

2047
02:06:56.82 --> 02:06:59.74
can't handle change and unexpected things this is the wrong person.

2048
02:06:59.74 --> 02:07:02.66
So if you're a person that looks at the military and goes damn I want a uniform I can

2049
02:07:02.66 --> 02:07:05.94
just wear what they tell me to wear I can polish it and nothing changes and that's what

2050
02:07:05.94 --> 02:07:13.94
I want, that's great on the parade field it sucks in combat.

2051
02:07:13.94 --> 02:07:18.62
The most extreme examples of this phenomenon occur in obsessive compulsive neurosis a condition

2052
02:07:18.62 --> 02:07:22.90
which the patient feels compelled to follow a pattern of ritualistic thoughts and acts

2053
02:07:22.90 --> 02:07:26.62
that these often include such bizarre symptoms as compulsive handwashing.

2054
02:07:26.62 --> 02:07:31.90
This is OCD, a preoccupation with timing and counting, recurrent, rumenative, ideas, stereotype

2055
02:07:31.90 --> 02:07:37.70
that verbal utterings and always standing with one toes absolutely in mind has obvious

2056
02:07:37.70 --> 02:07:42.18
significance for more military versions of the malaise.

2057
02:07:42.18 --> 02:07:46.66
You remember while we were talking about the degrees of insane, right?

2058
02:07:46.66 --> 02:07:49.42
Everyone's in say, because everyone's reality is a little bit different.

2059
02:07:49.42 --> 02:07:56.98
Well everyone has different degrees of how OCD they are and everyone has some level.

2060
02:07:56.98 --> 02:08:03.58
Maybe some people are not, you know, 0.01 but you got a spectrum and the case here is that

2061
02:08:03.58 --> 02:08:07.46
if you look at the military and you see people that are all uniform and you see that

2062
02:08:07.46 --> 02:08:11.58
everything's clean you look at that as a type of environment I might want to go into

2063
02:08:11.58 --> 02:08:17.30
because I'm kind of like that and that's how you end up with people in this zone for

2064
02:08:17.30 --> 02:08:20.50
what you guys wrote it down as like this guy is such a good idea.

2065
02:08:20.50 --> 02:08:23.10
He called it bomb to the tender ego.

2066
02:08:23.10 --> 02:08:30.86
I get it's such a great, it's such a great medicine for that like oh buttons are shiny.

2067
02:08:30.86 --> 02:08:38.06
Boots are lined up on the line, perfectly height order, everything is how I want it.

2068
02:08:38.06 --> 02:08:42.74
And that is such a good medicine for me, you know, for my tendencies where they came from

2069
02:08:42.74 --> 02:08:47.50
and then just like you said is and I made the reference to the bluangles from my they're

2070
02:08:47.50 --> 02:08:51.46
literally called the flight demonstration team.

2071
02:08:51.46 --> 02:08:54.82
But if you had the mindset that this is a reflection of combat, if this is a reflection

2072
02:08:54.82 --> 02:08:59.90
of the challenges you're going to face in the real world, I mean the disconnect there

2073
02:08:59.90 --> 02:09:01.94
seems like it'd be so obvious.

2074
02:09:01.94 --> 02:09:05.68
But all those stories that he's telling and the first three sections we did to this

2075
02:09:05.68 --> 02:09:11.70
is that people going oh my we close order joy of the best close order jope will tune

2076
02:09:11.70 --> 02:09:13.70
we're going to be the best blu-tune combat.

2077
02:09:13.70 --> 02:09:21.34
Dude yeah it's the I wish that with the this the disconnect was talking about something

2078
02:09:21.34 --> 02:09:26.94
else but the end state of all this is real people die at the end of all these stories

2079
02:09:26.94 --> 02:09:30.98
which is the worst part about it and then then the ultimate manifestation of that is

2080
02:09:30.98 --> 02:09:35.74
is a world of war and of like we are going to get online just like we did on the

2081
02:09:35.74 --> 02:09:42.22
break deck we're literally going to get in a line and move in in a line.

2082
02:09:42.22 --> 02:09:44.22
I guess insane maybe is a better word.

2083
02:09:44.22 --> 02:09:46.22
Yeah.

2084
02:09:46.22 --> 02:09:52.98
Yeah speaking of the degrees of what you're OCD he says such symptoms are not of course

2085
02:09:52.98 --> 02:09:57.82
confined to the chronic sick so you don't necessarily have to have some big issue milder

2086
02:09:57.82 --> 02:10:02.38
forms may well occur in normal population during times the stress bead counting foot

2087
02:10:02.38 --> 02:10:08.46
tapping and the mowling of dogma like the compulsion to make things clean and tidy during

2088
02:10:08.46 --> 02:10:15.74
periods of menstruation well known palliatives for the stressed psyche.

2089
02:10:15.74 --> 02:10:18.78
So this is something that you see people doing when they're stressed they'll say the

2090
02:10:18.78 --> 02:10:23.42
Lord's prayer or whatever except for Rose, Fug Rose.

2091
02:10:23.42 --> 02:10:28.50
Hmm remember when she fought for the first time against that Chinese girl what's your name?

2092
02:10:28.50 --> 02:10:29.86
If you know it.

2093
02:10:29.86 --> 02:10:37.86
Oh no it was against Johanna it was against Johanna and so Johanna Dave was like just on a

2094
02:10:37.86 --> 02:10:44.42
tear destroying everyone and she had the super hostile aggressive attitude just you know

2095
02:10:44.42 --> 02:10:49.30
getting people's faces and she'd been crushing people and she fought thug rose and they

2096
02:10:49.30 --> 02:10:54.74
squared off in the face off and Johanna's getting all crazy making their mean face and

2097
02:10:54.74 --> 02:11:01.30
everything and thug rose just just straight normal face just saying the loud Lord's prayer

2098
02:11:01.30 --> 02:11:06.26
for you to look the growth.

2099
02:11:06.26 --> 02:11:13.86
Um he says let us not be around the bush at the risk of offending those with delicate susceptibilities

2100
02:11:13.86 --> 02:11:18.10
or though or who themselves have problems in these areas they must be said that they

2101
02:11:18.10 --> 02:11:24.74
involve four matters of primary importance in every human life sex elimination eating and death.

2102
02:11:25.86 --> 02:11:28.18
These are things that cause us concern.

2103
02:11:30.74 --> 02:11:35.86
The greatest anxieties concern death and unconstrained disorder since the two are

2104
02:11:35.86 --> 02:11:41.62
inexperably related a defense against one is a defense against the other also this is perhaps the

2105
02:11:41.62 --> 02:11:48.82
crux of the origins of bullshit. So we're afraid to die death is a form of disorders we want

2106
02:11:48.82 --> 02:11:52.98
to get everything in order. Let us approach this from another standpoint whenever whatever

2107
02:11:52.98 --> 02:11:58.34
it's particular form of bullshit results in a state of affairs which is opposed to what many

2108
02:11:58.34 --> 02:12:04.10
people would regard as a primary source of delight the natural diversity of nature towards such

2109
02:12:04.10 --> 02:12:13.94
diversity it is impeccably hostile. It is no exaggeration to say that this aspect of militarism

2110
02:12:13.94 --> 02:12:17.86
is dedicated to the ironing out of differences the efficiency with which it destroys variety

2111
02:12:17.86 --> 02:12:23.54
imposes uniformity is matched only by its demand for conformity. So we are going against nature

2112
02:12:23.54 --> 02:12:27.94
when you're making everything the same and nature's death is part of nature.

2113
02:12:27.94 --> 02:12:34.42
This is against uniqueness uniqueness as market value not for nothing does current advertising

2114
02:12:34.42 --> 02:12:39.22
for the quote best car in the world make only one specific claim that no two roles

2115
02:12:39.22 --> 02:12:46.74
voices are alike. So there's what we're devaluing uniqueness but bull inverts these values

2116
02:12:46.74 --> 02:12:53.94
it worships homogeneity and frowns on deviants whether it's toecaps buttons or dressing by the

2117
02:12:53.94 --> 02:13:00.18
left hair length, kit inspection or marching feet the quintessence the quintessence of

2118
02:13:00.18 --> 02:13:07.54
perfection resides in conformity to a regulation pattern. This conformity is the product of constraint.

2119
02:13:07.54 --> 02:13:12.90
It seems that since bull is primarily concerned with substituting pattern for randomness

2120
02:13:12.90 --> 02:13:18.66
it evidently reduces anxiety behind the reduction of uncertainty. So there's a whole idea

2121
02:13:18.66 --> 02:13:24.74
psychologically that we just want to make things more certain less random how do we do that? Well

2122
02:13:24.74 --> 02:13:33.22
we just make everything the same. If I'm a person that is as anxiety and fear of the unknown

2123
02:13:33.22 --> 02:13:40.50
what am I going to do? Let's start trying to make everything the same. That's cool if you're on

2124
02:13:40.50 --> 02:13:45.78
the parade field that type of personality is actually awesome if you're on the parade field.

2125
02:13:45.78 --> 02:13:50.34
That type of personality that doesn't want anything to be shocking is a nightmare on the battlefield.

2126
02:13:54.10 --> 02:13:58.50
Anyone who doubts these soothing effects of bull has only to consider two other situations

2127
02:13:58.50 --> 02:14:04.02
of frightening uncertainty, marriage and death, few of played even a minor role in these events

2128
02:14:04.02 --> 02:14:07.86
would deny the emotional support that comes from the time-honored ritual of weddings and funnels.

2129
02:14:07.86 --> 02:14:12.18
I never thought that before. There's a reason you gotta do this this way. Here it is.

2130
02:14:12.18 --> 02:14:17.46
Let's face it. If you didn't set that day on the wedding, if you didn't set that day and have a bunch

2131
02:14:17.46 --> 02:14:22.26
of people invited and there wasn't a thing going on, you probably get 50% less of weddings

2132
02:14:22.26 --> 02:14:25.86
because people are freaking out. They're like, I'm not going through with us.

2133
02:14:28.98 --> 02:14:33.46
Two overlapping theories can be invoked. The argument is simple. Living organisms are complex patterns

2134
02:14:33.46 --> 02:14:37.54
which persist for a time within the essential disorder from which they came and to which they

2135
02:14:37.54 --> 02:14:43.06
will with equal uncertainty return. So you live, you're nothing and then these random,

2136
02:14:43.06 --> 02:14:48.34
freaking biological components fall into a pattern for a certain period of time and then

2137
02:14:48.34 --> 02:14:54.50
they all break apart in your debt. Which is a really whippazar way of him saying what I just said.

2138
02:14:54.50 --> 02:14:59.62
I think he gets an F on simplicity of that one. Whether it is a single cell,

2139
02:14:59.62 --> 02:15:04.02
the integrated systems of the total organism or the external social order,

2140
02:15:04.02 --> 02:15:08.82
there exist regulators, controls and constraints whose function it is to preserve the pattern to

2141
02:15:08.82 --> 02:15:15.46
keep it from keep to keep this from that to maintain purity and separateness. This holds as true

2142
02:15:15.46 --> 02:15:21.22
for biological process as it does for the construction of an urban sewage system. You have to put

2143
02:15:21.22 --> 02:15:29.78
controls around things. Indeed, life can be construed as a fight for orderliness in the course of

2144
02:15:29.78 --> 02:15:35.86
which much behavior both voluntary and involuntary, both external and internal is directed to this end.

2145
02:15:36.50 --> 02:15:44.74
Laws and rules of hygiene, prophylaxis, antibiotics, rejection mechanisms, adrenaline secretion,

2146
02:15:44.74 --> 02:15:49.86
and new year's resolutions are just some of the devices which aim to stem the perpetual

2147
02:15:49.86 --> 02:15:57.14
drift toward disorder. So that's what life is. You have to stay in order to stay alive.

2148
02:15:57.14 --> 02:16:02.50
And you do like you work out to keep everything in order. You try and eat right to keep everything

2149
02:16:02.50 --> 02:16:06.82
in order. You make new year's resolutions to try and keep everything in order. You clean your

2150
02:16:06.82 --> 02:16:10.98
teeth to try and keep everything in order. It's a fight. It's a fight to keep things in order.

2151
02:16:10.98 --> 02:16:16.82
It is of course losing battle. As Oscar Wilde said, good intentions are useless attempts to

2152
02:16:16.82 --> 02:16:25.46
metal with the laws of nature. Bullshit represents an extreme manifestation of a general

2153
02:16:25.46 --> 02:16:31.70
and necessary propensity on the part of living systems to resist randomness. This would account

2154
02:16:31.70 --> 02:16:38.98
for the fact that the satorial aspects of the syndrome are concerned with removing dirt

2155
02:16:40.02 --> 02:16:43.94
with maintaining separateness, with keeping green, green and white white, with preserving

2156
02:16:43.94 --> 02:16:48.74
status quo, keeping hair short, brass, shiny, rifles, clean, and with maintaining uniformity

2157
02:16:48.74 --> 02:16:56.18
by written order shouted commands and other behavioral constraints. But like waking consciousness

2158
02:16:56.18 --> 02:17:02.82
in contrast to the dream and normality and contrast to psychosis, bullshit makes its effect

2159
02:17:02.82 --> 02:17:07.78
by constraint upon the creativity of thought. He just said all that other stuff that I just said

2160
02:17:07.78 --> 02:17:12.26
for that. I'm sorry, it took a little longer. I should have skipped a little bit more. But

2161
02:17:12.26 --> 02:17:18.98
all that stuff of trying to maintain order is negatively impacting creativity. That's what

2162
02:17:18.98 --> 02:17:22.42
it's doing. And the more you focus on that stuff, the less creative you're going to be.

2163
02:17:23.30 --> 02:17:29.22
Bullshit may be regarded as an organization's response to the threat of its disintegration.

2164
02:17:30.02 --> 02:17:35.94
So if you're in the military and you don't keep order, there's actually a threat of

2165
02:17:35.94 --> 02:17:42.74
your organization falling apart. In the military, this threat has two sources, the external

2166
02:17:42.74 --> 02:17:48.66
enemy and the aggressive impulses of its own members. In either case, the greater the threat,

2167
02:17:48.66 --> 02:17:56.50
the greater the constraints, which means when you add conscripts that you were trying to get to fight,

2168
02:17:56.50 --> 02:18:01.86
you had to freaking tighten those people up, you had to keep it super rigid. You get in a special

2169
02:18:01.86 --> 02:18:07.14
operations. That's probably the least rigid because everyone volunteered through your four times to get to

2170
02:18:07.14 --> 02:18:12.02
that point where now, hey, I want to be here. So there's a much less constraints.

2171
02:18:15.30 --> 02:18:22.18
So that's where we're at. Now, at this point, Dixon, who wrote this book, goes into a bit of,

2172
02:18:22.18 --> 02:18:29.78
he goes down some Freud activities here, Sigmund Freud, which is, if you don't know anything about

2173
02:18:29.78 --> 02:18:36.42
Freud, Freud was a cocaine addict, I mean, he's at least, he was kind of a liar and a bit of a crack.

2174
02:18:38.98 --> 02:18:46.90
He basically spewed out all kinds of crazy theories and a majority of them, I don't know

2175
02:18:46.90 --> 02:18:51.54
from my little ones in this, but I'm pretty sure I'm the guy. A majority of them were wrong. A

2176
02:18:51.54 --> 02:19:00.02
majority of them were just batshit crazy. Like just weird theories that he thought up, but so

2177
02:19:01.14 --> 02:19:07.46
and I would tell you that, Dixon, well, this is again, he wrote this in 1976, this hadn't

2178
02:19:07.46 --> 02:19:12.50
progressed. People didn't have as much knowledge. Freud had more people hadn't understood how

2179
02:19:12.50 --> 02:19:20.02
we would freaking disaster. Freud was, but he, but Freud did just like a broken clock is right

2180
02:19:20.02 --> 02:19:25.46
twice a day. Freud did come up with some concepts that are still used and one of them is just that

2181
02:19:25.46 --> 02:19:32.42
we have a subconscious. Now, what Freud thought was that our subconscious was was basically built

2182
02:19:32.42 --> 02:19:38.10
before the age of five based on your arrogginess zones and all this weird stuff, right? And that

2183
02:19:38.10 --> 02:19:45.62
you, you just weird, just weird stuff. But you do have a subconscious and it does drive things.

2184
02:19:45.62 --> 02:19:51.62
It's not based on the way you are potty trained, which a lot of this Freud stuff is based on weird.

2185
02:19:52.98 --> 02:19:58.58
I think that dude had some issues. It's some serious issues. You know, I need to get Deryl Cooper on.

2186
02:19:58.58 --> 02:20:03.06
We need to do a freaking Freud breakdown with Deryl Cooper and see what's up. But the bottom line is

2187
02:20:03.06 --> 02:20:11.22
this guy's a cocaine addict and he's a bit of a quack, but some of his theories were correct.

2188
02:20:11.22 --> 02:20:18.02
And then on top of that, regardless of where people develop their personality, we all know that people

2189
02:20:18.02 --> 02:20:24.02
have personalities. And you know, like one of those personalities is, comes to the word comes

2190
02:20:24.02 --> 02:20:29.06
directly from Freud, which is like an anal, retentive personality. What we all know that type of personality,

2191
02:20:29.06 --> 02:20:33.22
it's a type of personality. Does it develop from where someone is how someone is potty trained?

2192
02:20:33.22 --> 02:20:37.38
No, actually, it's not where it develops from. We develop from a whole bunch of different things

2193
02:20:37.38 --> 02:20:41.70
and a bunch of different people from a different background can end up with that type of personality.

2194
02:20:42.34 --> 02:20:48.10
So he was wrong about where these things came from, but there are certain personalities that people have

2195
02:20:49.30 --> 02:20:56.74
and some of these things are reflected. We have to deal with. And is someone that's anal-retentive

2196
02:20:56.74 --> 02:21:01.86
going to be more apt to look at the military and think to themselves, that looks like my kind of scene,

2197
02:21:01.86 --> 02:21:08.58
absolutely. Is someone that's listening to rock and roll and their beds not made and they're

2198
02:21:09.86 --> 02:21:13.14
they got the crap on their fort? Is that the part type of person that's like I'd really like to

2199
02:21:13.14 --> 02:21:19.62
join the military? It's not, right? It's not. Echo Charles, you weren't like, oh man, you know what?

2200
02:21:19.62 --> 02:21:24.90
I'm kind of cruising over here. I'm kind of getting up around the crack of 10 30 in the morning.

2201
02:21:24.90 --> 02:21:28.82
Maybe the military's my route, right? That's funny. You said that because I remember back when

2202
02:21:28.82 --> 02:21:34.02
my friends were joining the military and you know, military's always an option for kind of floating around

2203
02:21:34.02 --> 02:21:39.54
when you're young or whatever. The one thing that stood out to me was like having to wake up at a

2204
02:21:39.54 --> 02:21:47.46
search at times. Weird. Yeah. Oh, check. So you got, so he starts focusing on this type of personality.

2205
02:21:47.46 --> 02:21:52.98
I'm going to fast forward through some of the Freudian weirdo crap that he talks about a little bit.

2206
02:21:52.98 --> 02:21:59.70
He doesn't go. He's only a few pages, but he says it does not need any vast stretch of the imagination

2207
02:21:59.70 --> 02:22:04.90
to see more than a passing similarity between these obsessive traits and the practice of bullshit.

2208
02:22:04.90 --> 02:22:11.70
But bull also has a two-pronged purpose to combat dirt and prevent illegitimate outbursts of aggression.

2209
02:22:12.34 --> 02:22:19.78
Aggression that is towards the superiors and potentially dangerous towards parent figures, right?

2210
02:22:19.78 --> 02:22:24.02
So that's one of the reasons we impose these things. It's to keep people in check.

2211
02:22:24.82 --> 02:22:30.42
At this stage in the argument, it is necessary to issue a caution. We are not saying that military

2212
02:22:30.42 --> 02:22:36.50
organizations are hotbeds of obsessional neurosis, nor that those given to bullshit are

2213
02:22:36.50 --> 02:22:42.18
necessarily manifesting compulsive symptoms. On the contrary, all that we have tried to show

2214
02:22:42.18 --> 02:22:47.54
is that the anxiety reducing aggression controlling and tenacious nature of bullshit

2215
02:22:47.54 --> 02:22:56.18
comes at least partly, explicable. So that you can get it. You can kind of reason with it.

2216
02:22:56.18 --> 02:23:02.90
And it's not all bad. And hey, I was freaking very, I mean, I was very into, you got to look

2217
02:23:02.90 --> 02:23:07.38
square away. My boots were always highly polished. My uniform was always

2218
02:23:07.38 --> 02:23:11.70
starched even my freaking camey uniform. That's the way I was. You know, task unit bruiser,

2219
02:23:11.70 --> 02:23:18.66
if you, here's an interesting dichotomy. Once you left our base, our little compound over there,

2220
02:23:18.66 --> 02:23:21.78
which was originally called shark base, and then called camp markedly,

2221
02:23:22.58 --> 02:23:26.98
if you went off that base, you were in a square away uniform. When you were on that base,

2222
02:23:26.98 --> 02:23:30.50
I didn't give a shit what you were. You could wear a freaking whatever, flip flops and a pair of

2223
02:23:30.50 --> 02:23:38.50
surf shorts. I did not care. So I wasn't like, you know, I wasn't a militant. I wasn't obsessive about it,

2224
02:23:38.50 --> 02:23:44.18
but I understood the value of it in certain situations. Research has shown not only that

2225
02:23:44.18 --> 02:23:51.14
psychological arousal is decreased by ritual, but also that under threatening conditions, normal

2226
02:23:51.14 --> 02:23:56.26
individuals like compulsive behave like compulsive neurotics. This is when you see people freaking out a

2227
02:23:56.26 --> 02:24:01.70
little bit. And they start doing weird, you know, start focusing on some little thing,

2228
02:24:01.70 --> 02:24:06.50
because they're freaking out about what's going on around them. Since military organizations

2229
02:24:06.50 --> 02:24:12.02
represent par excellence outlets for and consequently defenses against aggression and disorder,

2230
02:24:12.02 --> 02:24:16.58
they will tend to attract people who have some difficulty in reconciling these conflicting needs,

2231
02:24:16.58 --> 02:24:24.18
people who overvalue aggression, order and obedience. No doubt. This conclusion is supported by the

2232
02:24:24.18 --> 02:24:31.38
finding that patient suffering from obsessional neurosis, show improvement during military service.

2233
02:24:31.38 --> 02:24:35.54
So if you got a little bit of that activity in your brain, you're probably going to do pretty good.

2234
02:24:35.54 --> 02:24:41.62
Then he's got this whole flow chart set up, get the books so you can see it, but you got combat.

2235
02:24:42.34 --> 02:24:50.34
And combat causes a bunch of anxiety, death disorder, social disapproval, fear of being

2236
02:24:50.34 --> 02:24:55.06
called a coward, fear of your own aggressive impulses. That's what combat inflicts on you.

2237
02:24:55.06 --> 02:24:59.86
So how do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? Well, one did way to deal with it is

2238
02:24:59.86 --> 02:25:07.46
bullshit, like chicken shit, like polish your boots, dogma, ritual, codes of honor. So we put

2239
02:25:07.46 --> 02:25:12.90
these codes in place to sort of defend against all this anxiety. What is that result in? Rigidity,

2240
02:25:13.78 --> 02:25:20.74
conformity, traditionalism, over obedience, aversion to progress. And all those things attract

2241
02:25:20.74 --> 02:25:27.22
people with personal anxieties about dirt, aggression, disobedience. That's where it gets you.

2242
02:25:27.22 --> 02:25:36.42
And what does that do? Increases military incompetence, which by the way then increases the combat

2243
02:25:36.42 --> 02:25:46.34
scenarios that you read, which is a freaking nightmare. If the other thing it does, is it attracts these

2244
02:25:46.34 --> 02:25:52.98
people. Attracts these people that have, you know, that are the care about appearance, promotional

2245
02:25:52.98 --> 02:25:58.18
prospects, disapproval of those higher in their military hierarchy. They're scared of that.

2246
02:26:00.50 --> 02:26:09.54
So this is just this horrible cycle that we end up in. Where the anxiety creates this freaking

2247
02:26:09.54 --> 02:26:16.98
bullshit and this ritual and rigidity and conformity. And those things actually create, you

2248
02:26:16.98 --> 02:26:20.98
to perform worse in combat, which means all those things get worse and you end up in a horrible cycle.

2249
02:26:20.98 --> 02:26:25.14
As opposed to someone that's like, hey, now's not the time for that. We got to go fight. We

2250
02:26:25.14 --> 02:26:30.26
are that you can actually break out of this cycle. Did it so hard to listen and explain this,

2251
02:26:30.26 --> 02:26:39.06
even just something as simple as the word dirt. Like the idea that, and he did it well. Like you

2252
02:26:39.06 --> 02:26:42.10
get dirt in a right place. You should shoot a rifle. That's the problem. So we need to be able to

2253
02:26:42.10 --> 02:26:46.50
respond to dirt, but the responsive, or I want people that don't want dirt. So I'm going to create a

2254
02:26:46.50 --> 02:26:51.06
scenario by which it repels the dirt and doesn't allow the dirt into my system. It's actually not what you

2255
02:26:51.06 --> 02:26:56.66
want. If you want something goes, yeah, it's going to get dirty here. And we're not going to react to

2256
02:26:56.66 --> 02:27:00.10
the dirt by creating a system that doesn't let the dirt in. We're actually going to encourage

2257
02:27:00.10 --> 02:27:05.70
a system of things get dirty. Like, no horse, we can, we can, we can deal with that. Not by

2258
02:27:05.70 --> 02:27:10.10
repelling the dirt, but by accepting the fact that it's going to get dirty. And we're going to clean

2259
02:27:10.10 --> 02:27:16.26
and deal with those things. But just the way he paints that picture of that cycle of the

2260
02:27:16.26 --> 02:27:21.70
psychology of, do you want someone who doesn't like dirt or someone who does like it to be able

2261
02:27:21.70 --> 02:27:27.30
to deal with it? And the irony that's inside that is what it attracts is the person that can't handle

2262
02:27:27.30 --> 02:27:32.74
it, which is the thing that's going to get you killed. Yes. God, it's part of listen to it is it,

2263
02:27:32.74 --> 02:27:36.42
just to just to use these words again. So there's a, there's a dichotomy of leadership, right?

2264
02:27:36.42 --> 02:27:41.46
And everything has to be balanced. Right. And yet, when you think of these words, you think of a

2265
02:27:41.46 --> 02:27:50.58
military stereotype, rigidity, conformity, traditionalism, obedience. Those are military characteristics

2266
02:27:51.54 --> 02:27:56.74
and they are good. Right. They are good. You've got to be, you've got to have some level of

2267
02:27:56.74 --> 02:28:01.78
rigidity. You've got to want to conform with what's happening. You've got to be into those traditions.

2268
02:28:01.78 --> 02:28:07.38
You've got to be obedient. Those are those are totally awesome military qualities.

2269
02:28:07.38 --> 02:28:14.74
And you also got to be able to buck all of those qualities in order to survive and order truly

2270
02:28:14.74 --> 02:28:22.90
excel. So even these, these characteristics that he's talking about, you can see that anyone that

2271
02:28:22.90 --> 02:28:27.38
has those is going to be attracted to the military. In some level, or I'd say most people that

2272
02:28:27.38 --> 02:28:32.82
have some of those characteristics are going to be attracted to the military. The problem comes

2273
02:28:32.82 --> 02:28:39.22
when you have a lot of people like that attracted and even bigger problem comes is when people are

2274
02:28:39.22 --> 02:28:43.46
getting promoted based on those things and they're not getting promoted based on creativity.

2275
02:28:43.46 --> 02:28:49.22
They're not getting promoted based on not being a yes man. They're not getting promoted based on

2276
02:28:49.22 --> 02:28:55.62
new ideas. That's not, none of that is happening. You're getting, oh, you're more obedience.

2277
02:28:55.62 --> 02:29:01.62
So you're going to get promoted. Hey, if you are going into combat, do you want to work for someone

2278
02:29:01.62 --> 02:29:07.22
that has been promoted for 19 years because they've been obedient and rigid and conformed?

2279
02:29:07.22 --> 02:29:13.22
Hell, no, hell no. And inside the reaction to the dichotomy to subscribe to

2280
02:29:14.42 --> 02:29:19.06
the less balanced you are with that reaction. The more extreme your reaction is, the worse things

2281
02:29:19.06 --> 02:29:23.38
are going to be. And if the system reinforces it and the person goes in that direction,

2282
02:29:24.82 --> 02:29:31.06
that the inability to react to the dichotomy by being balanced is, yeah, look, do we want someone

2283
02:29:31.06 --> 02:29:35.62
that, you know, that will never conform? No, you don't want someone that's never going to

2284
02:29:35.62 --> 02:29:39.62
conform. Do we want someone that just can't obey? No, we don't want anyone like that. We're not saying

2285
02:29:39.62 --> 02:29:45.78
that. But man, you don't want to go to the extreme or it's going to suck. Yes. All right, one last thing

2286
02:29:45.78 --> 02:29:50.90
before we close this section out, he says in other words, this is basically what you and I were

2287
02:29:50.90 --> 02:29:56.34
just saying to have. In other words, those very characteristics which are demanded by war,

2288
02:29:56.34 --> 02:30:04.34
the ability to tolerate uncertainty, spontaneity of thought and action, having an open mind to the

2289
02:30:04.34 --> 02:30:12.26
receipt of novel and perhaps threatening information are the antithesis of those possessed by people

2290
02:30:12.26 --> 02:30:21.62
attracted to the controls and orderliness of militarism. That's exactly what you and I were just

2291
02:30:21.62 --> 02:30:31.94
saying. And that statement is important to remember. It's important to remember that the best qualities

2292
02:30:31.94 --> 02:30:39.38
for good performance in war and therefore good performance in business and life are the ones

2293
02:30:39.38 --> 02:30:43.78
that we talk about here all the time. What he just mentioned, the ability to tolerate uncertainty,

2294
02:30:43.78 --> 02:30:52.90
spontaneity of thought and action, having an open mind, open to new ideas, even threatening ideas,

2295
02:30:52.90 --> 02:31:00.34
having an open mind to threatening ideas, you have many discussions I've had where I won in the

2296
02:31:00.34 --> 02:31:06.18
initial conversation in the first four sentences because when Dave came to me and said,

2297
02:31:06.18 --> 02:31:10.90
I think we should do this a different way and I said, oh, sounds like you fought this through,

2298
02:31:10.90 --> 02:31:15.46
what do you want to do? Do you know how many times I've just had a immediate victory,

2299
02:31:15.70 --> 02:31:21.78
immediate victory? And by a victory, I mean, all of a sudden, Dave's not coming on the offense.

2300
02:31:21.78 --> 02:31:26.50
He's opening his mind. We're going to be able to come to a positive net outcome

2301
02:31:27.30 --> 02:31:32.26
because when he came to me with, I don't like the way we're doing this and instead of me saying,

2302
02:31:32.26 --> 02:31:35.38
that's because you don't understand what's happening and all of a sudden we're arguing. And

2303
02:31:35.38 --> 02:31:42.66
then I say, oh, really, please, please tell me what you think we should do. Oh, it's so easy.

2304
02:31:43.30 --> 02:31:49.22
Wow, critical is that you just to, when you define the winning is getting the out the right

2305
02:31:49.22 --> 02:31:55.22
outcome, not winning the arena, and I won because I want the outcome to be right. Yeah, I won because

2306
02:31:55.22 --> 02:31:59.22
we figured out the best way to do this and it wasn't Dave's way and it wasn't my way,

2307
02:31:59.22 --> 02:32:04.82
either. We actually compromised and figured out the best way to make this happen right.

2308
02:32:04.82 --> 02:32:09.86
For you can ridiculous. Those are the qualities we should want. Those are qualities we should

2309
02:32:09.86 --> 02:32:17.14
strive for. So we can be better leaders and better people. We'll continue this book next time.

2310
02:32:17.54 --> 02:32:24.34
For now, echo, speak of getting, speaking of getting better. Yes. You got neum ways that we can get

2311
02:32:24.34 --> 02:32:29.46
better. Yeah. I'm speaking to where it's Dave. I know you got some stuff to do. I do. Why don't you

2312
02:32:29.46 --> 02:32:37.38
kick on out of here, man? Right on. And with that Dave Burke had to go, obviously busy.

2313
02:32:38.34 --> 02:32:46.50
And well, nonetheless, we're here. We're trying to get better. So what do you got echo, Charles?

2314
02:32:47.38 --> 02:32:55.30
Oh, well, I could go into the whole intelligence thing, but in the sake of saving time,

2315
02:32:55.30 --> 02:33:01.38
let's just think of the smart thing to do on this path that we're on to improve ourselves.

2316
02:33:01.38 --> 02:33:05.54
We're working out, we're reading. So through these workouts and training, we're

2317
02:33:05.54 --> 02:33:10.82
so physically and mentally. We might need some help, some supplementation that provides

2318
02:33:10.82 --> 02:33:19.14
benefits. Do we all need help? Maybe maybe not. I'm going to say I haven't met people that

2319
02:33:19.14 --> 02:33:28.66
didn't need. Okay. They might not. I needed help. But who does not voluntarily accept some

2320
02:33:28.66 --> 02:33:34.10
beneficial benefits? We're all going to benefit from benefits. So one of those benefits that we can

2321
02:33:34.10 --> 02:33:43.30
have is from a new energy drink that we have. Jockel, discipline, go. Healthy, not unhealthy. So

2322
02:33:43.30 --> 02:33:49.54
usual legacy energy drinks that are unhealthy. They provide a good front end benefit, but they

2323
02:33:49.54 --> 02:33:55.06
not healthy back end detriment. This one healthy and tastes good and gives you energy all upside.

2324
02:33:55.78 --> 02:34:03.30
You know what else provides like a front side kind of up feel good moment. Like, like,

2325
02:34:03.30 --> 02:34:11.70
legacy energy drinks. Crystal method. Sure. I'm just saying. Yes, you're the legacy energy

2326
02:34:11.70 --> 02:34:18.18
drinks. Think about what they do. They make you feel good for a very short period of time

2327
02:34:18.18 --> 02:34:27.30
and then they kill you. Yeah, which is what a traditional legacy crap energy drink is going to

2328
02:34:27.30 --> 02:34:34.18
do. Make you feel good for a little bit and then over time you die. Yeah. It's true. Whereas

2329
02:34:34.18 --> 02:34:44.26
miraculously miraculously we have made something that gives you all the upside of an energy drink.

2330
02:34:44.26 --> 02:34:53.06
Meaning you will feel energized. But later you won't be coming down with multiple diseases

2331
02:34:55.06 --> 02:35:00.66
caused by this thing that you put in your body. In fact, the opposite true, you will be more healthy

2332
02:35:00.66 --> 02:35:04.58
when you get done drinking one of these than you were before you drink it. Think about that.

2333
02:35:05.62 --> 02:35:10.18
There's no one else that's going to say that because they can't because they didn't go to the

2334
02:35:10.18 --> 02:35:15.30
degree that we went to to make sure we were making something good for you. Yeah, yeah, man. Yeah,

2335
02:35:15.30 --> 02:35:19.14
that's one of those no brainers for sure. And it tastes good. A bunch of different flavors

2336
02:35:19.86 --> 02:35:25.78
mangoes the best. My opinion, not Jocca's opinion. But in opinion is one of these things that,

2337
02:35:25.78 --> 02:35:32.82
you know, my, okay, my favorite is Jocco Palmer, which is like the, the Tekken Arnold Palmer.

2338
02:35:34.82 --> 02:35:42.58
I would not, I don't, I love it. I love it. And it's number probably like five or six out of the

2339
02:35:42.58 --> 02:35:47.54
rankings, the sales rankings. All right, like you're not. I don't like it so much because Arnold

2340
02:35:47.54 --> 02:35:53.46
Popper is popular. You can go, let me put it this way. You can go to a restaurant tonight and you

2341
02:35:53.46 --> 02:35:58.26
can order an Arnold Palmer because people drink Arnold Palmer's and it's a normal flavor for people to

2342
02:35:58.26 --> 02:36:02.98
want. Wait, but is that a good one restaurant tonight and get mango drink the answer is no.

2343
02:36:02.98 --> 02:36:09.30
Yeah, probably not. So why is that? Why is why is mango, which it is more popular than Jocco Palmer?

2344
02:36:09.30 --> 02:36:14.34
Well, it depends. So, wait, is Arnold Palmer an alcoholic drink? No. It's half ice tea.

2345
02:36:14.34 --> 02:36:19.46
Yeah, I'm right up. Yeah, I guess. I mean, I don't know. I mean, it's seen. I have no idea.

2346
02:36:19.46 --> 02:36:22.50
Here's the thing. Here's, there's, we've been trying to figure that. I've been trying to figure that out.

2347
02:36:22.50 --> 02:36:26.02
Part of the reason I think is because I called it Jocco Palmer, which is like an inside joke that

2348
02:36:26.02 --> 02:36:31.46
only I got. I don't think people understand Jocco Palmer is kind of a joke about Arnold Palmer.

2349
02:36:31.46 --> 02:36:37.06
Oh, and we didn't even spell it like Arnold Palmer. We abbreviated it so I don't get sued.

2350
02:36:37.06 --> 02:36:42.50
Oh, yeah, all right. Maybe. Can't be jack and a dude's name and just putting it on your can.

2351
02:36:42.50 --> 02:36:45.46
No, it's called a Jocco Palmer POMR. POMR. POMR.

2352
02:36:45.46 --> 02:36:50.10
And it, so we're probably going to put it. We're going to we're going to make it more obvious as to

2353
02:36:50.10 --> 02:36:56.18
what it is because like I said, I'm not rolling into a restaurant tonight with my wife for dinner

2354
02:36:56.18 --> 02:37:02.90
and ordering a mango drink of any kind, right? But I am ordering an Arnold Palmer possibly.

2355
02:37:02.90 --> 02:37:07.70
Right, but I guess, and not to go too deep into it, what it like, it's not like you're going to

2356
02:37:07.70 --> 02:37:13.94
have a discipline go with dinner most of the time. Seems same. It's like they're just different

2357
02:37:13.94 --> 02:37:19.06
context of when you. So if I go to the store randomly, any a snack, I might get one of those little

2358
02:37:19.06 --> 02:37:23.62
mango smoothies, I'll be like, oh dang, that's because mango taste good. You see what I'm saying?

2359
02:37:23.62 --> 02:37:28.74
Sure, that's like a, this is a drink, bro. Yeah, I'm saying they're all drinks and they're all

2360
02:37:28.74 --> 02:37:34.02
drunk. You're going to be one to drink. Yeah, but yeah, I guess no one really drinks mango juice

2361
02:37:34.02 --> 02:37:40.50
on a regular basis. But no mango soda. Yeah, but there's smoothie, there's like ice cream, there's

2362
02:37:40.50 --> 02:37:45.30
like frozen yogurt, there's like mangoes and go away for this pistachio ice cream too,

2363
02:37:45.30 --> 02:37:50.90
when I'm not getting a pistachio soda. But pistachio is a good flavor in general. And that's,

2364
02:37:50.90 --> 02:37:55.78
that's my whole point. It's under a defense on the context and what you're experiencing, the flavor.

2365
02:37:56.34 --> 02:38:02.74
Do you know what I'm saying? Hey, look, I like jocopommer. I do. I like mango better. Of course,

2366
02:38:03.46 --> 02:38:07.54
but either way, it doesn't matter because each person's opinion is individualized to them.

2367
02:38:07.54 --> 02:38:12.50
Doesn't matter. You could like jocopommer at a level literally level 10, like the it cannot get any

2368
02:38:12.50 --> 02:38:17.70
better. It has no bearing on my own or in my opinion. Oh, what I like? Well, that's where I'm at level 10.

2369
02:38:17.70 --> 02:38:23.14
And if you want to get some, get some. Yep. So yeah, again, different flavors.

2370
02:38:23.94 --> 02:38:28.34
Get the one you want. Try them all. That's what I would say. Because the mango seems more

2371
02:38:28.34 --> 02:38:33.46
risky because it's exotic. Orange, not so much. Seems to be in true. So you might be like,

2372
02:38:33.46 --> 02:38:39.30
oh, that's a safe one. You know, but hey, man, with great risks come great rewards, as

2373
02:38:39.30 --> 02:38:44.18
a wise man once said. Awesome. Also, on this path, you want to look up after your joints and

2374
02:38:44.18 --> 02:38:51.62
immunity joint warfare, super cruel oil. Vitamin D3, cold war. These are all immunity and joint

2375
02:38:51.62 --> 02:38:57.70
protective supplements. Don't forget about the mok. Don't forget about the mok, which is the

2376
02:38:57.70 --> 02:39:05.70
dessert. It's a dessert that is also good for you. Again, there's not too many desserts that you can eat.

2377
02:39:05.70 --> 02:39:16.10
You can relish the flavor and the texture and the whole thing from a, like a taste perspective,

2378
02:39:16.10 --> 02:39:22.50
but there's more than that. The whole thing, the whole consumption, you can relish and when you get

2379
02:39:22.50 --> 02:39:27.94
done, you're stronger. You're better. The whole experience. Yeah. It's not like when you go down the

2380
02:39:27.94 --> 02:39:34.90
freaking. You go down to the local ice cream store in the order of mint chocolate chip milkshake,

2381
02:39:34.90 --> 02:39:38.58
and they make it right. And it's good. Yeah. Get a good experience. We're not mad at that.

2382
02:39:38.58 --> 02:39:44.42
And then when you get done, you know what just happened. Yeah, you poisoned yourself. Yeah.

2383
02:39:44.42 --> 02:39:48.26
That's what happened. You pay a bit of a price. You're paying a big price. And you for sure can't

2384
02:39:48.26 --> 02:39:52.18
do it again. The next in the next in the next day. Oh, you don't do that. Don't do that. Yeah,

2385
02:39:52.18 --> 02:39:58.26
don't do that because there's something called type 2 diabetes, what you're working on. It's true.

2386
02:39:58.26 --> 02:40:02.98
You're in route. Yeah. You're in route. Oh, yeah. If that's what we're doing. If that's what we're doing

2387
02:40:02.98 --> 02:40:09.46
every day. It's true. All kinds of heart disease. You got problems. Yeah. Don't do that. Yeah. So you kind of

2388
02:40:09.46 --> 02:40:14.42
get a day away from that one. Play this weird balancing game. There's no reason to balance right after

2389
02:40:14.42 --> 02:40:20.10
you can go. You can get milk. You can get done with your dinner. You have that sweet tooth,

2390
02:40:20.10 --> 02:40:26.82
which is fine. Normal. But you can follow that sweet tooth right to the milk container.

2391
02:40:28.82 --> 02:40:31.94
You're going to play any, you don't have to play any balancing game. You just go. Yeah.

2392
02:40:31.94 --> 02:40:35.78
As much milk as you want. Much more straight up. You want five scoops of milk?

2393
02:40:36.58 --> 02:40:40.98
Good. Gonna be thick. Oh, it's gonna be thick unless you add some more milk. Are you going to

2394
02:40:40.98 --> 02:40:46.42
put a scoop of milk? I'm going to put on a three scoop of milk. Yeah. Three is my next five would be.

2395
02:40:46.42 --> 02:40:51.06
You're going hard. But you know if they're if you're there. Right up to you. Yeah. Get it.

2396
02:40:51.06 --> 02:40:55.62
Call it. Get it man. Get it. Fise because that's a hundred grams of protein. Yeah.

2397
02:40:55.62 --> 02:41:00.02
Hundred something. Yeah. Hey, you know, this stuff at jockelfuel.com. If you want to get free shipping,

2398
02:41:00.02 --> 02:41:05.62
which look, the reason this isn't a hey order now and get free shipping. There's not what we're doing.

2399
02:41:05.62 --> 02:41:11.22
Right. Here's what we're doing. We're competing with one of the biggest companies in the world

2400
02:41:11.22 --> 02:41:17.62
who offers you free shipping. Cool. They got a big log algorithm that's figuring this stuff out

2401
02:41:17.62 --> 02:41:21.46
and they got all this mass scale and all this things going on. They're trying to get your information.

2402
02:41:21.46 --> 02:41:27.54
They're trying to get you into the zone where they can own you. Which is understandable. We get it.

2403
02:41:28.34 --> 02:41:32.66
We want you to have an option to still get free shipping and not end with the matrix.

2404
02:41:33.78 --> 02:41:39.54
So you go to jockelfuel.com. Stay out the matrix. Oh, yeah. And if you subscribe to one of these

2405
02:41:39.54 --> 02:41:44.58
items, which you should, because then you'll be able to get it with free shipping. There you go.

2406
02:41:44.58 --> 02:41:50.34
Jockelfuel.com. You can also get the get-in at the vitamin shop. You can get the drinks,

2407
02:41:50.34 --> 02:41:54.58
the energy drinks at wall-walk on the East Coast or working on some other convenience stores.

2408
02:41:54.58 --> 02:42:02.18
Right now, sorry, West Coast. The convenience terrain, a little bit rough, a little bit rough.

2409
02:42:02.18 --> 02:42:07.54
The way it split up and what's where. So we're working it. But if you got a vitamin shop near you,

2410
02:42:07.54 --> 02:42:11.94
where you are, you may have worked whatever. Grab it from there. Oh, for sure.

2411
02:42:11.94 --> 02:42:17.54
Oh, good. 100%. 100%. There you go. Check it out. Yeah. It's good. Also,

2412
02:42:17.54 --> 02:42:23.14
you just do. We're doing jiu-jitsu. To know jiu-jitsu or to not know jiu-jitsu, which one is more beneficial?

2413
02:42:24.98 --> 02:42:28.98
We want to know jiu-jitsu. Yes, or we do. I don't care if you know one day of jiu-jitsu.

2414
02:42:28.98 --> 02:42:32.42
Spend it in zero days of jiu-jitsu anyway. When you do jiu-jitsu, you're going to need a key.

2415
02:42:32.42 --> 02:42:39.54
Yep. Hey, I can only train jiu-jitsu one day a week. So I'm not going to train. It's not the answer.

2416
02:42:39.54 --> 02:42:44.18
Yeah, it's true. The answer is I can only train jiu-jitsu once a month. So I'm doing it once a month.

2417
02:42:44.18 --> 02:42:48.42
Oh, that's the answer. Yes, sir. You get the chance to train jiu-jitsu. That's what we're doing.

2418
02:42:48.42 --> 02:42:52.18
It's true. So when you get your gear, you get the best gear that you possibly can.

2419
02:42:52.18 --> 02:42:56.66
Made an America by the way. An origin gear. Go to origin.usa.com for these things.

2420
02:42:56.66 --> 02:43:02.10
You get rash cards on there as well. Somebody's on there. Also, from origin. USA.

2421
02:43:02.10 --> 02:43:09.78
American-made denim jeans. Come on, Delta 68 jeans. My favorite jeans.

2422
02:43:09.78 --> 02:43:15.46
Of all time, by the way. Yeah, and FYI, lay fit me up too because you got, you got a pair of

2423
02:43:15.46 --> 02:43:23.46
Delta 68s. And we recut the Delta 68s, probably like, I don't know, six months or something like that.

2424
02:43:23.46 --> 02:43:32.02
And to provide more comfort. I dig it. Yeah. So Delta 68s, the best, most comfortable

2425
02:43:32.02 --> 02:43:36.66
things that you can put on your legs. And they look good too, by the way. So here, and maybe you

2426
02:43:36.66 --> 02:43:40.18
care about this. Maybe you don't. But here's the thing. Factually, this is what happened.

2427
02:43:40.18 --> 02:43:44.18
So boom, I don't. I didn't even have to go to called the master. My daughter heard of it.

2428
02:43:44.18 --> 02:43:52.10
War the Delta 68 origin jeans to the master. They're pretty new too. And we're a white t-shirt.

2429
02:43:52.98 --> 02:43:58.42
My wife likes me and a white t-shirt that don't ask why. It's just how it is. Let's just know that.

2430
02:43:58.42 --> 02:44:03.46
These are all things I do not care about. Yes, but the concept, the underlying concept,

2431
02:44:03.46 --> 02:44:09.46
I think most of us, it has some value. So she was like, hey, you're looking really nice.

2432
02:44:11.22 --> 02:44:17.86
Boom. So you got a no brand Delta 68s. Functional, made in America, look good. Um, you know,

2433
02:44:17.86 --> 02:44:23.14
durable, all this stuff. Get these jeans and echo trolls's wife will think you look good. No,

2434
02:44:23.14 --> 02:44:27.94
she'll probably won't look at you. Oh, hopefully, don't look at you. But she thinks I look good.

2435
02:44:27.94 --> 02:44:33.14
So maybe if you're married or have a girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever, they'll think you look good.

2436
02:44:33.14 --> 02:44:37.38
And I'm too. We got work. We got work where coming out, by the way. If you don't know that,

2437
02:44:37.38 --> 02:44:42.50
we got work where coming out. So you, when you're out there on the construction site,

2438
02:44:42.50 --> 02:44:48.02
you're out there as a lineman, you're out there on the farm. Whatever you're doing, you're working.

2439
02:44:48.02 --> 02:44:56.02
We got work where calling, which is made in America. But for real made in America, every ounce of

2440
02:44:56.02 --> 02:45:01.62
that thing, every rivet, every, every, every thread, every, every, even the thread itself.

2441
02:45:01.62 --> 02:45:08.90
We're making work where for workers, for American workers, made by American workers.

2442
02:45:09.62 --> 02:45:17.62
That's what we're doing. Yes, sir. Orgen, USA.com. Also, if you want to get a shirt or had a hoodie that says

2443
02:45:17.62 --> 02:45:23.94
discipline equals freedom, or you want to represent this path in any way. Go to jockelstore.com.

2444
02:45:23.94 --> 02:45:28.10
That's where you can get this stuff. Some good stuff on there. Some new stuff on there.

2445
02:45:28.90 --> 02:45:30.34
So you get to stuff on there. Oh, so you get to stuff on there.

2446
02:45:30.34 --> 02:45:36.42
You get to do this section, you know, where look, if you do, you get to. And you kind of want to

2447
02:45:36.42 --> 02:45:42.10
represent the path and you get to kind of a hybrid representation scenario. You can do that.

2448
02:45:42.10 --> 02:45:48.10
You know, it's cool. I noticed at the master. We have a jiu-jitsu night, the second night. We do

2449
02:45:48.10 --> 02:45:55.78
jitsu introduction to jiu-jitsu. And there's more people now. The use of it was no one did

2450
02:45:55.78 --> 02:46:01.86
jiu-jitsu. And now, majority of people have done jiu-jitsu. So we're getting in the right direction.

2451
02:46:01.86 --> 02:46:07.70
Yeah. We want everyone to do jiu-jitsu. We could keep it a secret, right? That's a kind of an

2452
02:46:07.70 --> 02:46:12.58
ego thing, right? If I don't tell anyone about this, I'm just going to be the baddest man on the

2453
02:46:12.58 --> 02:46:17.30
board. Just so much more superior. I'm so much more superior. That's a, that's a,

2454
02:46:17.30 --> 02:46:23.54
dork. Dorky. Yeah. Because actually, no, you know what? I don't think that's, that's not

2455
02:46:23.54 --> 02:46:27.70
called for the dork. That's enough. Go move. Yeah. That's just pure ego. I'm gonna, I'm not going

2456
02:46:27.70 --> 02:46:32.58
to teach you anything. Yeah. I'm just going to keep this special thing, this superpower to myself.

2457
02:46:32.58 --> 02:46:39.78
Yeah. Because it's kind of surprising that the graces, I think the graces did it right because I think

2458
02:46:39.78 --> 02:46:45.62
that as they broke it out, then they started promoting it and teaching it and spreading the word.

2459
02:46:45.62 --> 02:46:50.18
I think if they would have failed to do that, they would have been five years behind.

2460
02:46:50.90 --> 02:46:55.70
It would have taken an extra five years for people to start kind of figuring out on their own,

2461
02:46:55.70 --> 02:47:03.70
just from videos and UFC and all those things. But it just would have been bad. They did the right

2462
02:47:03.70 --> 02:47:07.22
thing when it was time to bring it out. They brought it out and started teaching it to people.

2463
02:47:07.22 --> 02:47:12.10
Well, actually, I'll kind of in a way do you want better? Probably not even five years when you think

2464
02:47:12.10 --> 02:47:17.38
about it because you said because you said they, they, they might figure it out because of videos

2465
02:47:17.38 --> 02:47:22.18
in UFC or whatever, the whole existence of UFC is because of how you're crazy. So it's, they

2466
02:47:22.18 --> 02:47:27.38
wouldn't have had the UFC. The straight of wouldn't exist. Because it's all it was essentially

2467
02:47:27.38 --> 02:47:33.06
demonstration of how effective you did to it and it would be. Essentially what UFC won was.

2468
02:47:33.06 --> 02:47:38.50
So, man, that wouldn't exist. No one would do it. It'd be probably relegated to little secret

2469
02:47:38.50 --> 02:47:45.22
sex. Yeah. Like Brazil, little secret dojo's, doing their secret art, just rolling every

2470
02:47:45.22 --> 02:47:48.74
place there. So it's there for everyone to get into. Yeah, it's not like that. And if you want to

2471
02:47:48.74 --> 02:47:52.82
get a T-shirt that talks, you know, represent. So is that you're on the Jitu path?

2472
02:47:52.82 --> 02:47:56.90
I don't even have a job. I'll store it now. Yeah. But just stuff on there. We have a subscription

2473
02:47:56.90 --> 02:48:01.14
situation as well called the shirt locker. It's a new creative. I was at the

2474
02:48:01.14 --> 02:48:07.30
master. Myder herd of it. And everyone's well, well, let's face it. Every day, I was wearing a

2475
02:48:07.30 --> 02:48:14.10
different shirt from the shirt locker. Every single shirt that I wore, someone asked,

2476
02:48:14.10 --> 02:48:18.90
hey, where did you get that shirt? Including people who weren't even there for the master.

2477
02:48:19.54 --> 02:48:24.50
Like where did you get that shirt? The support song. That was a good one. A lot of people ask about

2478
02:48:24.50 --> 02:48:29.78
tell them to go to them. Now, the last good shirts on there. So yeah, you get a new shirt every month,

2479
02:48:29.78 --> 02:48:36.90
creative designs kind of new designs, creative outside of the box designs. But relative.

2480
02:48:37.46 --> 02:48:41.62
It's been very awesome. Good feedback on that one. Yeah. Also, if you're going to subscribe to

2484

2485
02:49:06.18 --> 02:49:14.18
activities in this country and no one knows what to do. We'll be able to tell you what to do.

2486
02:49:14.18 --> 02:49:17.54
We'll be there. We'll be on the Underground Jocco Underground.com. We made it. So we had

2487
02:49:17.54 --> 02:49:23.54
an alternate platform in case something happens with this platform. And because we did that,

2488
02:49:23.54 --> 02:49:30.26
it cost money to do that. And if you want to support that, it cost you $8.18 a month. And in order

2489
02:49:30.26 --> 02:49:35.14
to give you something back for that in the immediate, we do another little podcast on there. We

2490
02:49:35.14 --> 02:49:41.38
talk about some, we do some Q&A. We talk about some alternate things. So if you want to

2491

2495
02:50:04.98 --> 02:50:09.38

2499
02:50:22.98 --> 02:50:28.98
the contrast. You know, they'll take this video stuff a room. It's just, it's just a thing.

2500
02:50:28.98 --> 02:50:33.62
You know, it's just a thing. I didn't realize how much of a world though video thing is.

2501
02:50:33.62 --> 02:50:38.90
Like, they're so. What do you mean? I mean, it's like, uh, it's a little thing, right? It's a little,

2502
02:50:38.90 --> 02:50:44.26
it's a little ecosystem. What? That you're in. Oh, like the industry, whatever. That's your

2504
02:50:50.66 --> 02:50:55.46
size people up, but I don't. You size up their cameras. Oh, yes, I definitely. You

2505
02:50:55.46 --> 02:51:01.86
size up their videos. Yeah. I mean, they create a field like, are you trying to act like you,

2506
02:51:01.86 --> 02:51:05.54
you don't. Obviously, I might say something like, oh, I saw this video. Look,

2507
02:51:05.54 --> 02:51:11.30
pretty cool. You're like, oh, I sent it to you. And you'll be like, um, you know,

2561
02:56:08.18 --> 02:56:14.42
That is not possible. Instead, be ready to shift, be ready to change, be ready to adapt,

be ready to adjust the new environments and new information. Don't let your mind get stuck.
