[00:00:00] This is Jocobodgast number 162 with echo Charles and me, Jocobo-Willink. Good evening,
[00:00:07] echo. Good evening. On the 22nd of April 2008, two marine battalions, the first battalion
[00:00:19] ninth Marines, the walking dead from Vietnam fame, and the second battalion eighth
[00:00:25] Marines were switching out in Ramadi, Iraq. One battalion going home in a few days, and
[00:00:35] the other just starting its seven-month tour. Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance
[00:00:45] Corporal Jordan Herger, 22 and 20 years old, respectively, one from each battalion. They
[00:00:54] were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate to an outpost that contained a
[00:00:59] makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines. The same broken down Ram shackled building was
[00:01:08] also home to a hundred Iraqi police. They were my men in this fight against the terrorist
[00:01:16] in Ramadi. Yale was a dirt poor mixed race kid from Virginia, with a wife and a daughter
[00:01:27] and a mother and a sister who lived with them, and he supported them as well on $13,000 a year.
[00:01:38] Herger was a middle-class white kid from Long Island. The two of them were from two
[00:01:46] completely different worlds in our country. Not good, not bad, just different. Had they
[00:01:55] not join the Marine Corps, they would never have known each other. They would never have
[00:02:01] even understood that multiple America's exists simultaneously, depending on your education
[00:02:08] level, your families income status, maybe, but they were Marines. They were combat Marines.
[00:02:18] And because of this bond, they were brothers as close as if they were born to the same
[00:02:24] woman. The mission orders they received from the sergeant, their squad leader, I am sure
[00:02:34] when something like this. Okay, you two clowns. Stand this post and let no unauthorized
[00:02:42] personnel or vehicles pass. You clear on that? I'm also sure that Yale and herder than
[00:02:51] rolled their eyes and said in unison something like, yes, sergeant, we got it. We know
[00:02:57] what we're doing. With just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words
[00:03:04] no kidding sweetheart, we know what we're doing. They then relieved the two other Marines
[00:03:13] on watch who turns out we're probably the two luckiest Marines on Earth that day. And they
[00:03:21] assumed they're post at the entry control point at joint security station, NASA in the
[00:03:28] Soviet District of Ramadi, Iraq. A few minutes later, a large blue truck turned down the
[00:03:37] alleyway. The alleyway was no more than 100 yards in length and sped its way through the
[00:03:45] serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were
[00:03:55] posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. If you know what combat is like,
[00:04:05] you know what I'm talking about when I say catastrophically. 24 brick masonry houses were damaged
[00:04:14] or destroyed by the blast. A mask 100 yards away collapsed. The trucks engine came to
[00:04:24] rest 200 meters away knocking most of a building down before it stopped. Our EOD guys, our explosive
[00:04:35] guys, wrecking the blast was made of at least 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died.
[00:04:45] And because these two young infantry men didn't have it in their DNA to run from danger,
[00:04:51] 150 men, 50 US Marines and 100 Iraqis were saved. When I read the situation report about the
[00:05:04] incident a few hours after it happened, I called the regimental commander and I asked him
[00:05:08] for details of what had happened. It seemed different to me. Unfortunately, Marines dying or being
[00:05:18] seriously wounded is common in combat. We expect Marines and for that matter soldiers, sailors,
[00:05:29] airmen and co-scardsmen regardless of rank or MOS to do their duty to stand their ground and do their
[00:05:37] duty and to die if that's what the mission requires. The regimental commander had just returned
[00:05:49] from the site and he agreed with me, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event.
[00:05:55] Just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened
[00:06:03] and then to recognize and decorate these two young Marines and acknowledge their bravery,
[00:06:09] I'd have to do it myself. Because I understood that the bureaucrats back in Washington
[00:06:15] would never accept Iraqi statements for what had taken place. If getting these Marines properly
[00:06:23] awarded had any chance at all, it had to come under my signature as a general officer.
[00:06:34] So I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half dozen Iraqi police,
[00:06:41] all of whom told the same story. They said the blue truck turned down into the alley
[00:06:49] and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine jersey walls.
[00:06:56] They all said they knew immediately what was going on, particularly as the Marines began to fire.
[00:07:06] The Iraqi police all began firing as well. Then to a man, they ran for safety just prior to the
[00:07:17] explosion. They all survived. Many were injured, some seriously injured.
[00:07:30] One of the Iraqis said to me that they had all run from the danger like any normal man would
[00:07:37] to save his own life. What he didn't know until then, what he learned that very day,
[00:07:47] was that Americans are not normal.
[00:07:52] With tears wailing up, he said, sir, in the name of God, no sane man would have stood there and done
[00:07:58] what they'd done. No sane man. They saved all of us. What we didn't know at the time,
[00:08:14] and what I didn't know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later, after I wrote a summary
[00:08:20] of this bravery and submitted it and submitted them both Yale and Herger for the Navy crosses,
[00:08:26] which is the number two award from Marines and sailors in combat.
[00:08:32] What I didn't know was that one of our security cameras that we had at the location,
[00:08:39] that was damaged initially in the blast, had called everything.
[00:08:47] It had happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it to me.
[00:08:51] It took exactly six seconds by that recording from when the truck entered the alley
[00:08:59] until it exploded. Six seconds.
[00:09:08] And you can watch, and I did watch many, many times on this recording, the last six seconds of their
[00:09:17] young lives. When it first started, I suppose it took a second or so for the Marines to
[00:09:27] separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on. They had no time to talk it over.
[00:09:37] Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant had told them to do
[00:09:41] only a few minutes before, let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.
[00:09:50] At that point in the recording, the two Marines had about five seconds left to live.
[00:09:58] It took maybe another two seconds for the two jarheads to raise their weapons,
[00:10:03] take game and open fire on the truck.
[00:10:05] By this time, the truck was halfway through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time.
[00:10:14] Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi policemen, some of whom had fired their AKs,
[00:10:20] now scattering like the normal and rational men they were.
[00:10:24] Some running right past the Marines.
[00:10:26] The two Marines had about three seconds left to live.
[00:10:38] For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines weapons firing nonstop.
[00:10:47] The trucks windshield exploded into shards of glass as their rounds took it apart
[00:10:52] and undoubtedly tore into the body of this terrorist that was trying to kill their brothers.
[00:11:01] On the way of the danger at the time, the other Marines and Iraqi soldiers in the barracks
[00:11:07] could take comfort in the fact that two Marines were on watch and would die before they ran.
[00:11:12] The recording shows the truck co-reening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines.
[00:11:25] In all of this instantaneous violence, Yale and Herder never hesitated.
[00:11:34] They never stepped back.
[00:11:37] They never even started to step back.
[00:11:39] They never even shifted their weight.
[00:11:44] With their feet spread shoulder with the part, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could.
[00:11:55] They only had one second left to live.
[00:12:02] Then the truck explodes.
[00:12:03] The camera goes blank and the two young men go to their god.
[00:12:22] Six seconds.
[00:12:27] Not enough time to think about their families,
[00:12:29] their country, their flag, for about their lives, or their deaths.
[00:12:39] But more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty
[00:12:50] into eternity.
[00:12:51] That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world, tonight for you.
[00:13:08] And that was a speech that was given by Marine Corps, General Kelly, and he gave the speech to
[00:13:34] Gold Star families. These are families who have lost a service member, killed in action.
[00:13:45] And he gave that speech on February 21st, 2014.
[00:13:53] And General Kelly was obviously speaking from the heart.
[00:13:58] Not only was he the commanding General in charge of those Marines,
[00:14:13] but he also understands loss on a very personal level.
[00:14:20] Because on November 9th, 2010, General Kelly's oldest son,
[00:14:25] first lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action.
[00:14:34] By landmine, while he was on patrol,
[00:14:38] leading upiltoon of Marines in Afghanistan.
[00:14:41] And that story of those two Marines is
[00:14:57] yet another example of the dedication and the devotion of the Marines.
[00:15:06] And we know full well that there is example after example,
[00:15:15] after example from all our branches of service.
[00:15:23] Examples of sacrifice.
[00:15:27] And you can think about those six seconds.
[00:15:46] Six seconds, we throw those away all the time.
[00:15:51] We can waste hours and days. We can even waste weeks.
[00:16:02] As if we have an endless supply.
[00:16:10] But we don't.
[00:16:10] But if you were giving six seconds to live,
[00:16:23] what would fill your mind?
[00:16:28] Would you be okay with that?
[00:16:33] Would you nod your head and think, okay?
[00:16:37] It's time.
[00:16:46] Or would you be filled with regret?
[00:16:51] In those last moments, would you think about what you should have done?
[00:16:55] What you should have said? Who you should have been?
[00:17:11] And in the end, would you realize that there's no reason ever to waste six seconds of your
[00:17:25] life?
[00:17:35] That is one lesson.
[00:17:39] We can take away from General Kelly's speech.
[00:17:42] Six seconds can be an eternity.
[00:17:55] Another lesson we can take away from this speech.
[00:17:59] And from it's author knowing that General Kelly had lost his son is that we have to move forward.
[00:18:05] We have to move on. And this isn't to say, don't feel anything.
[00:18:15] Because that's wrong. And that is not what we are doing.
[00:18:24] I mean, who can fathom the pain that General Kelly felt at the loss of his eldest son?
[00:18:29] As his eldest son pursued a career that was no doubt inspired by the General himself.
[00:18:45] But he moved on. He drove on.
[00:18:48] I was talking to a friend of mine.
[00:19:00] And we were talking about survivors guilt,
[00:19:06] which is something that we all feel on some level
[00:19:12] when we're in the military.
[00:19:14] And sometimes I think people feel as if there's something wrong with them
[00:19:23] or they feel like they're weak because they let their emotions get a hold of them sometimes.
[00:19:31] And I could see my friend stealing that.
[00:19:35] And I told them about an interview that I did with Colonel Tom Fife on this podcast.
[00:19:42] He was an army officer that had served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
[00:19:48] He had gotten a purple heart in all three wars.
[00:19:53] And I explained to my friend that as Colonel Fife and I were discussing the men that he lost in Vietnam,
[00:20:05] Colonel Fife got choked up.
[00:20:06] Despite the fact that 51 years had passed since he lost those men.
[00:20:17] 51 years, but he's still got emotional.
[00:20:25] Why is that?
[00:20:29] It's because we care about our men.
[00:20:31] Because we're not going to be able to do that.
[00:20:33] Why is that? It's because we care about our men because we care about each other.
[00:20:40] And it's because while we hear that time heals all wounds, time does not remove the scars.
[00:20:46] They are going to be there and they are going to hurt.
[00:20:53] And that's okay.
[00:20:58] And that's normal.
[00:20:59] It's normal to feel the pain and it's normal to feel the guilt.
[00:21:03] And I think that's one of the hardest things for vets that I talked to
[00:21:08] is that they don't think that this is normal.
[00:21:15] But I am telling you, it is normal.
[00:21:20] Every vet that I've talked to,
[00:21:22] from World War II, Vietnam, the guys that have served,
[00:21:30] and I rack in Afghanistan, everyone feels it.
[00:21:35] It's part of the deal. It's part of the job.
[00:21:40] It's part of the aftermath of war.
[00:21:43] It's always existed.
[00:21:45] And if you're feeling that,
[00:21:55] then you should know that you are not alone.
[00:22:07] What else do we learn from this speech?
[00:22:11] Well, another thing opens up a whole box, a whole Pandora's box of lessons learned.
[00:22:24] We're talking about urban combat and how fast things can unfold there.
[00:22:32] Urban combat is exceptionally stressful.
[00:22:35] The space-time continuum in urban combat is very compressed.
[00:22:41] The threats are 360 degrees. The enemy can be 500 meters away,
[00:22:46] but they can also be 5 meters away.
[00:22:50] And one of the ways that we can mitigate that stress
[00:22:54] and thereby mitigate casualties and thereby mitigate the guilt
[00:22:59] that we all carry is by knowing and understanding that form of combat
[00:23:07] to the best of our ability.
[00:23:11] And as always, history has much to teach us.
[00:23:19] And I want to go now to a direct source.
[00:23:23] The leadership from Charlie I-5.
[00:23:31] Charlie Company, first battalion, fifth Marines,
[00:23:34] Charlie I-5 fought in the Battle of Waysity.
[00:23:38] A brutal battle that took place during the TET offensive,
[00:23:41] Vietnam 1968, the battle lasted from January 30th to March 4th.
[00:23:47] It included 11 Arvin battalions for US Army Battalions,
[00:23:52] three US Marine Corps battalions, support from the Air Force,
[00:23:57] and they were fighting against the strength of about 10 enemy battalions.
[00:24:02] It was a massive battle and way,
[00:24:07] was a built-up city.
[00:24:10] It had a population of almost 150,000 people.
[00:24:14] It had typical urban terrain and also some unique terrain like the Citadel,
[00:24:20] which was a massive walled portion of the city.
[00:24:25] By the time it was over, the enemy had lost thousands of men killed,
[00:24:30] the South Vietnamese, had lost 452 men in America,
[00:24:36] suffered 216 men killed in action and 1,584 wounded in action.
[00:24:46] And here are some quotes from an interview
[00:24:51] from the digital journalist with a guy by the name of John Olson,
[00:24:55] an army combat photographer who is in
[00:24:59] way during this battle. He said, I was in way for five days.
[00:25:04] I'd been in Vietnam for one year at this time.
[00:25:09] I'd seen a lot of battles and I thought I was pretty experienced,
[00:25:12] but I'd never seen anything like way.
[00:25:17] There was tremendous bravery, a lot of dead.
[00:25:22] There was a situation in way where we had Marines in a courtyard.
[00:25:26] They had been moving from house to house and transitioning across this courtyard.
[00:25:30] They had rocketed.
[00:25:35] A lot of them were wounded.
[00:25:37] There was no radio contact. We were pinned down and in pretty bad shape.
[00:25:43] We had an element that eventually came into a leave us and had had a priest.
[00:25:47] And he gave last rights to the dead and he was a very generous priest.
[00:25:53] He offered to give the last rights to any of us that wanted them dead, wounded,
[00:25:57] or not scratched at that point.
[00:26:02] In context, it was such a horrific battle with such horrific images.
[00:26:07] Way was different.
[00:26:10] There were tremendous casualties and no way to treat them,
[00:26:13] no way to get them taken out.
[00:26:18] There were reports and as shown in this image,
[00:26:20] there was a Marine who was badly wounded.
[00:26:23] So badly he couldn't be treated.
[00:26:25] Then he was zipped up in a body bag while he was still alive.
[00:26:34] That's what way was like.
[00:26:37] I was in way for five days and we were under heavy fire all the time.
[00:26:43] One of my favorite quotes was a journalist asking a Marine how many times he had been wounded in
[00:26:48] way and he said today sir.
[00:26:59] So it was a brutal battle and there was just incredible heroism and sacrifice and of course there
[00:27:09] were many lessons learned.
[00:27:13] And while the lessons focus on urban combat and they focus on the battle ways
[00:27:18] city, I think as you hear some of these lessons learned you'll see they apply broadly
[00:27:26] to leadership as a whole and as we know if we understand the way we can see it in all things.
[00:27:34] So let's go to this document.
[00:27:36] Lessons learned Charlie won five operation ways city 31 January 1968 to five March 1968.
[00:27:48] Even under the best of circumstances street fighting is a bloody business.
[00:27:54] This was in the end the ultimate lesson learned by the United States Marine Corps personnel
[00:27:59] who participated in this historical battle, considered by many to be the bloodiest of the Vietnam War.
[00:28:08] The Marine forces involved in Operation Way City lost 142 Marines killed an action during the
[00:28:14] monthlong battle including the initial fierce clashes involving primarily fighting throughout the
[00:28:19] southern sections of the city and the climactic full-scale battles inside the Citadel fortress itself.
[00:28:25] Hundreds more Marines were wounded and had to be met a fact on both sides of the river.
[00:28:32] Enemy casualties estimates range well into the thousands.
[00:28:38] Although Operation Way City will long be remembered as an overwhelming victory over the best
[00:28:43] conventional forces the enemy could throw at us and although the fifth Marines
[00:28:47] overcame very unfavorable odds and ultimately triumphed in the finest traditions of
[00:28:52] Marines in combat in truth this battle was a very close thing.
[00:28:59] At the squad, platoon and company levels, casualty rates were very severe as high as 75% or more
[00:29:07] in some units. This was especially true during the first day of day or two of each units
[00:29:14] initially experienced in full-scale urban combat. There's an important piece right there.
[00:29:24] During the first day or two of a unit going into combat, what does that mean? That means
[00:29:31] then that first day or two day or two you are learning a ton. That also means
[00:29:37] that if you can find out and figure out how to simulate that combat before you enter into those
[00:29:44] situations you'll be able to overcome or at least mitigate some of those initial shock
[00:29:54] things that happen that shock your system and you're not ready for them.
[00:29:58] And I talk about this with doing Jiu Jitsu for instance for females, right?
[00:30:04] If you're a female that wants to learn self-defense and you start training Jiu Jitsu.
[00:30:11] If you don't train Jiu Jitsu and some guy grabs a hold of you, you're in shock.
[00:30:17] You're not used to it. You have to contend with that
[00:30:22] something that you're on a costume too. If you train Jiu Jitsu, guess what? You have guys
[00:30:27] grabbing you every single day. They're grabbing you. They're grinding on you. They're trying to
[00:30:30] move you. You don't have to overcome that. Same thing with combat. The closer you can get to
[00:30:38] simulating what you're going to face in combat, the better you're going to do in combat.
[00:30:42] And you don't have to learn these horrible lessons your first entry. And you know, you and I've
[00:30:47] talked about this too. If you get, if let's say I learned a new move in Jiu Jitsu and I did it to you.
[00:30:53] You, you, I'd catch you. And then I show it to you. And now I'm saying I can't barely catch you anymore.
[00:31:01] Right? That's all it took. All it takes is you knowing and understanding. And it's the same
[00:31:05] thing when we talk with businesses. And we do, we do roleplaying exercises as a leader.
[00:31:10] Yeah. And how do you talk? How do you tell someone that they need to improve their performance?
[00:31:14] You do a couple roleplays and you get good at their objections that they're going to give you
[00:31:17] where the reactions that they're going to have, you can get better. If you wait until the real thing,
[00:31:24] you're not doing yourself any favors. Yeah. It's kind of like an ambush, right? Like an
[00:31:29] ambush is so effective. But if you know the ambush is coming, exactly. It's not even effective at all.
[00:31:35] Yeah. And once you've been ambushed, like I imagine, I mean, it happens all the time. Any,
[00:31:41] any time you, you know and understand what's going to happen, you're infinitely more equipped to handle
[00:31:46] that thing. Yeah. As opposed to, I have no idea what's happening. And I'm going to go and figure it out
[00:31:52] on the fly. Yeah. So experience is the best, but guess what? Experience is expensive. It takes a lot of
[00:32:01] time. So what you have to do is you have to train. Yeah. That's what you have to do. What if the only
[00:32:06] time you, what if you wanted to get good at street fighting? And the only time that you got to
[00:32:10] practice was when you got on a street fight. Yeah. Even if you literally went out every day and got
[00:32:15] in a street fight, two things would happen. Number one, you get arrested. But number two, you get all
[00:32:19] the first street fight, you might pick the wrong person and die. Yes. That is true. Right? Yeah.
[00:32:27] So what you want to do is you want to get into a training environment. Yes. And then you want to get
[00:32:30] yourself skilled. Yeah. Same thing with the military, same thing with fighting, same thing with
[00:32:36] shooting, same thing with business, anything that you're doing. It's another thing. I see like
[00:32:40] business people. There's business people that have been through, let's say, been through an
[00:32:43] acquisition before. They know what to expect their anticipating what's going on. And it makes them
[00:32:50] that better at forcing what's going to happen and mitigating the risk to it. How do you, if you
[00:32:56] can't go through the acquisition, what do you do? Read about them. You know, the interview people
[00:33:01] learn about them, figure out what to expect, but how you're someone on your team that has been
[00:33:05] through an acquisition before. So you get can capitalize on their experience. Yeah. It's crazy. I guess
[00:33:13] when you think about it, not crazy, but it's interesting. So you know, like sports teams, for example,
[00:33:18] like a, well, I guess football, say football for an example, you practice for like five or six days
[00:33:25] just practice practice practice practice. Two, sometimes more hours every single day, you know,
[00:33:31] maybe a day off, maybe. And then yeah, for one game. So it's like there's training, then there's
[00:33:36] performance kind of thing. And they go kind of hand in hand, like you got a performance training,
[00:33:40] and then you know, the game or whatever that you learned stuff during the game too. But it's,
[00:33:46] it's interesting where one game is predicated on so much training, so much training, but then
[00:33:53] when you go to work, it's like you kind of expect to have gone or they expect to or whatever,
[00:33:59] the expectation is that you went through your training already. And then they'll add sprinkles of training.
[00:34:05] But you're talking about like a work, just normal work. Yeah, when you go to work. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:34:09] Yeah. All right. So everyone's from all you'll have a good. Well, that's,
[00:34:12] quite honestly, that's one of the recent Esslon, Esslon front is doing well because people are realizing
[00:34:18] that if you want your leaders to know how to lead, you actually have to train them how to lead. And
[00:34:22] that you can actually do that. Yeah. So that's one of the reasons that it's Esslon front
[00:34:28] is in such high demand because we can actually train your leaders to handle these situations that
[00:34:37] they're coming up against. And when you do that, you have this massive advantage. Yeah.
[00:34:41] And we see the companies that we work with, they, they, their, their performance just improves
[00:34:47] immensely because their leaders are working together and learning how to lead. And it's the most
[00:34:52] powerful thing you can have. Yeah. It's, it's weird because I, you know, I'm kind of behind the scenes
[00:34:57] guy with Esslon front and I see like, you know, any video that's been done, I probably seen it,
[00:35:01] you know, and I'm around, you know, all the time. So essentially, I'm getting the course too,
[00:35:07] you know. And it's interesting where I think probably in a lot of cases, I probably
[00:35:13] am more trained in it than most people, even most people companies that you work with or whatever,
[00:35:18] because I'm kind of getting it second hand and listening because it applies to everyday life,
[00:35:22] you know, like this whole deal. It's not just work. It isn't. In fact, for me, I mean, yeah,
[00:35:27] it applies to my quote unquote work, but it applies to like family stuff, you know, wife stuff.
[00:35:34] And the big thing, this is the big thing, this is a big difference. You know the material,
[00:35:40] you, but you because of your position, you use it on your family, but you know,
[00:35:44] you use it in a work environment. And therefore, you get to learn the technique, but you don't
[00:35:49] get to roll, you don't get to spar. And here's the thing, when we work with companies,
[00:35:55] it's not like, oh, here's this information, and then they go apply it perfectly.
[00:35:58] No, they come back and say, hey, this didn't work. Yeah, I went and talked to Guy and he said,
[00:36:02] that's like, oh, okay, cool. Yeah, here's how you got to overcome that. So there's,
[00:36:06] you got to get the initial information. Yes, but you still have to apply it. Even if you train
[00:36:12] a group for combat, as much as you possibly can, they're still going to have a certain delta
[00:36:19] that they're going to need to rise to when the real failure. And so we see that with companies,
[00:36:24] we see that with individual leaders that are part of companies where they're, and I show up,
[00:36:31] sometimes, you know, there's some people out there that are just straight up in the game.
[00:36:35] And they're in the game before I even show up, like it's the icing on the cake,
[00:36:40] and even people that have red extreme ownership, 10 times they've red dichotomy of leadership,
[00:36:45] 12 times they've listened to every single podcast, and they'll still ask questions about things,
[00:36:52] because they haven't quite put it together. Yeah, but like they haven't mapped it perfectly on
[00:36:57] their situation. Right. And just like I said, like it takes, it takes, like, okay, how you say,
[00:37:02] I don't really get to spar. I do get to spar, but they're real easy. Yeah. Super easy for an
[00:37:07] person. What do I got? I got you. I got my wife, you know, you know, just coming to easy sparring
[00:37:12] partner, technically, yeah, for this stuff. It is. I mean, technically, you're the easiest one
[00:37:16] partner, because you're just like, you're doing the same thing. Yeah. And also, it's like,
[00:37:20] there's no friction. I mean, very little friction, maybe on some level. But that's a song.
[00:37:29] But the, you know, these people at work when they apply it, when you don't, when you have a
[00:37:34] whether it be a corporate job or whatever, you know, anytime where you have bigger teams, different
[00:37:38] personalities, you know, you care about, yes, on different levels. It's like, it takes way more. It takes
[00:37:44] more effort and more time on the mat. You know, people to get proficient to where you look at a situation.
[00:37:51] You go, oh, here's what this, here's the problem. Going to hear this guys, you go,
[00:37:53] you go, you go, you go to a little control, minimize, I just leave a little bit and let him have
[00:37:56] some more control. And that'll make him feel better and they'll do a better job. Like, it takes a
[00:37:59] little bit of experience to get to that point. Yeah. And, and, you know, a lot of times, like I said,
[00:38:05] when we go and work with a company that this fully in the game, and they'll be bad, they'll be nailing
[00:38:11] nine out of ten things. And then they'll be one more thing that they need a little adjustment on,
[00:38:14] and they make that adjustment and they go, oh, yeah, you know, and everything makes sense. So
[00:38:20] training is how you get good. Don't waste your time getting beat up in street fights in order to learn.
[00:38:29] It doesn't make sense. All right, moving on. The ultimate success of this operation could have
[00:38:38] been significantly improved in our opinion by several factors, including one, improved less restrictive
[00:38:46] rules of engagement, including situational flexibility down to the platoon level. This is something
[00:38:50] we hear about all the time. Here's the deal. But what that really means is decentralized command,
[00:38:58] you need to trust your troops. You need to explain to them what is important and what is not.
[00:39:03] Rules of engagement to tell someone you cannot do this. What I'm saying, if I say echo,
[00:39:10] you cannot shoot at this type of building. If I tell you that, what I'm telling you is,
[00:39:17] I don't trust you to make a good decision based on the information I give you. If I was to say,
[00:39:21] listen, some of these buildings that are marked with a star, those buildings are historical buildings
[00:39:28] that will cause the civilian populace to get angry at us. So don't shoot at them.
[00:39:35] If I say that to you and I say, tell you, explain to you why it's important. And then I say,
[00:39:41] hey, look, then again, remember you're in the field, you need to protect your men,
[00:39:46] and you say, God it. And now you go in the field and if you're a good leader and you trust me,
[00:39:50] and I trust you, and I've explained the commanders intent well, and you understand the strategic impact
[00:39:55] of disobeying or of going outside the rules that are not the rules, but the direction that I've given you,
[00:40:02] then you understand that? That's great. And you'll make a good decision because what that decision
[00:40:06] might entail is you're getting shot at from one of these buildings. And now you have to take it down.
[00:40:11] If I don't trust you to make that decision, what do I do? I put strict rules of engagement on you.
[00:40:17] And now you can't do something. And that is not decentralized command. And it's not generally good.
[00:40:26] Do you have to put some broad rules in place? Yes, you absolutely do. But you have to make sure
[00:40:30] that the people on the ground understand that those rules can be bent if they have to and they
[00:40:34] have to have the authority in the leeway to do that. Next, two, improved communication of intelligence
[00:40:40] information to all levels of command. Of course, communicate communication is one of those things. And again,
[00:40:46] I feel I always feel when we go to work with a company. It's one of the first things I have to ask
[00:40:51] is what are your methodology of communication through your company? How do you communicate with
[00:40:55] your front line trips? How do you communicate with your middle-level managers? How do your middle-level
[00:40:59] managers and your front line troops communicate with you? Because sometimes the front line troops might
[00:41:04] see something out on the battlefield that you don't see because you're up in the ivory tower.
[00:41:09] And how do they communicate that back to you? Do you have a methodology? Oftentimes,
[00:41:14] communication is ineffective or they don't have procedures around. They don't have protocols on
[00:41:20] how to communicate. That's bad. So communication up and down the chain of command,
[00:41:26] simple, clear and concise. That's the way it's got to be. Three, acquisition of improved intelligence
[00:41:31] data in particular concerning the disposition and size of enemy forces. That's cool. That's a
[00:41:37] little bit of a universal fantasy for military people that we want great intelligence. We want
[00:41:45] to know the enemy is. If we knew where the enemy is, our job is to be a lot easier. Yeah. So that's a
[00:41:51] universal fantasy. And we should always strive to achieve that fantasy, but it's very difficult to get to.
[00:41:56] But then they go to this, reconnaissance and small unit probes to fix enemy positions are critical.
[00:42:00] What that means is when you want intelligence, go get it. Go find it.
[00:42:05] Gather the intel yourself as much as you can. For improved supporting fire plan access to our
[00:42:13] artillery naval gunfire, direct fire from armored vehicles and air support should be judiciously
[00:42:18] employed. Duploied. So where does that mean we need to cover? We need to cover from big guns.
[00:42:24] Covered move. Five significantly increased training for urban conflict, street fighting,
[00:42:31] practice and preparation. I think we just covered that training is always paramount.
[00:42:38] Six deployment of available chemical weapons in this case tear gas for offensive operations
[00:42:44] during early stages of the operation. These guys use tear gas and it worked well.
[00:42:51] The North Vietnamese army had didn't have gas masks and they didn't like it.
[00:42:58] Yeah, no. Of course, you know there's people when you say chemical weapons, what do we think of?
[00:43:06] We think a mustard gas. There's other, you know there's nerve agents in nerve gas. That's what
[00:43:10] people generally think of when you think of chemical weapons. But chemical weapons are also
[00:43:17] tear gas. And tear gas can be very effective. There's also some people that can just be
[00:43:22] ETF through tear gas. Continuing. Seven improved dissemination of operational plan details down
[00:43:36] to the fire team level. Fire team leaders. These fire team that leaders. If the fire team leaders
[00:43:46] and you're talking about someone that's in charge of foreguys or six guys or something like that,
[00:43:49] really small little element. If those people understand what you're trying to accomplish as a team,
[00:43:56] that means they can execute at their level and make things happen. They can move the ball in the
[00:44:01] right direction. If they don't know where they're supposed to be going, guess what? They can't help you.
[00:44:07] They can't help you. So broad guidance needs to be given. It needs to be updated. People need to
[00:44:14] understand, hey, we're trying to move forward. We're trying to take this area. We're trying to move
[00:44:18] across this line. Everyone needs to understand that. If they don't understand that, they're actually
[00:44:26] no good to you. If you go to fire team leader out on the flank somewhere that has no idea that you're
[00:44:32] trying to move forward or move east or west or north, that person is just sitting there waiting
[00:44:37] for you to tell them what to do. They're almost worthless. So, and this also means if you're
[00:44:43] a fire team leader, and you don't know if you're supposed to be going north of east or west or whatever,
[00:44:47] you should be raising your hand and saying, hey, what are we doing? Tell me what we're doing.
[00:44:53] Continuing on the other side of the scale, small unit experience, individual marine determination,
[00:44:59] the buddy system, the quick learning capacity of Marines under combat conditions,
[00:45:05] the combined leadership officers, staff, and CEOs, and NCOs of one five at all levels, and the
[00:45:11] ultimate ability to coordinate fire support and execute street fighting tactics under heavy fire
[00:45:16] were factors that won this pivotal battle despite incredible odds, high casualty rates,
[00:45:21] and the resulting turnover of officers and NCOs. So, it comes down to your individual
[00:45:30] Marines and your front line leadership that make these things happen. Which, no doubt, the military,
[00:45:39] the US military is awesome in their front line leadership and their front line troops.
[00:45:45] They make so many things happen. Even in many cases, despite poor leadership, you just have great
[00:45:51] front line leadership. I mean, I would say that a lot, you know, you get a platoon that had
[00:45:56] kind of a marginal, and if not, maybe even a bad platoon commander, but you just get some guys
[00:46:01] in that platoon that are awesome. The platoon would be awesome. As long as the leader was humble enough
[00:46:07] to take guidance. If the leader wasn't humble enough to take guidance, they would fail,
[00:46:12] because he would just drag everyone in his terrible ways down. If he had the common sense to say,
[00:46:18] you know what I'm going to listen to these guys? I'm going to let them kind of run with it.
[00:46:21] Patoon would do fine. Continuing on, certainly using 2020 perspective of hindsight,
[00:46:28] this battle could have been decided even more timely and decisive fashion reducing friendly
[00:46:32] casualty rates in the process by paying attention to the fundamentals of planning Marine
[00:46:36] operations. Proper prior planning prevents piss-pour performance, and they actually edited out piss
[00:46:44] because they're squared away Marines. Yeah, got to come up with a good plan and had they done
[00:46:52] that better. This is a typical situation. Hindsight's always 2020. And I always avoid becoming a
[00:47:01] armchair post-game critic. In the military. I mean, I'll criticize someone like a fighter in the
[00:47:11] UFC or whatever, but when it comes to military operations, it's really easy to sit back and
[00:47:19] throw darts and say, well, you know, I would have done this. You weren't there. You didn't see it.
[00:47:25] I didn't see it. I wasn't in the situation. I have all the facts now they didn't have those facts.
[00:47:30] Yeah. Most very cautious about hooking darts into the past. And you deal with that
[00:47:37] situation. You kind of use it. You actually do. You use this as, even when you say you can sit back
[00:47:44] and be a tactical genius. I would ever say yes. If I make a video, you can sit back and be like,
[00:47:51] look at these like 10 mistakes or 10 things or whatever. Meanwhile, there's like a thousand elements.
[00:47:58] So, 990 elements have that to be created well and work and all this stuff. And then you can just
[00:48:04] be like, yeah, those, because essentially, those are created for you. You know, you don't have to
[00:48:07] create those things. All you have to do is poke holes in the tent. Yeah. I can focus instead of having
[00:48:12] to focus on a thousand things. I can take a broader look and see the 10 things that you screwed up.
[00:48:17] Yeah, or one thing. Or all of that. No, no, no, in my case, like, probably just one. Maybe two.
[00:48:23] All right. The following details regarding the lessons learned from Operation Wasted
[00:48:27] are offered from the former members of Charlie Company, First Battalion Fifth Marine Regiment,
[00:48:31] First Marine Division, who served in combat during Operation Wasted City and who were directly
[00:48:36] involved in the battle with NVA forces inside the Citadel fortress from 13 February 1968 through
[00:48:41] five March 1968. Situation terrain. There is an infinite variety of possible landscapes that
[00:48:49] may be confronted by a Marine force given the mission of attacking an enemy force in urban terrain.
[00:48:54] Infinite variety of possible landscapes. What does that remind me of? That reminds me of
[00:49:03] life itself. Hmm. When the tent offensive broke out on 31 January 1968 and conventional
[00:49:11] NVA forces overran major sections of the largest cities in South Vietnam, Marine forces were
[00:49:16] literally knee deep in rice patties in jungle mud. Since first establishing a beach head in
[00:49:22] 1965, Marines had been assigned the mission of conducting a counter insurgency, a rural conflict,
[00:49:28] fighting for the most part of guerrilla army. The tent offensive changed all of that and for the
[00:49:35] first time since the height of the Korean War in 1954, Marines found themselves with a mission that
[00:49:41] involved urban combat. You have to be able to never turn your back on something. I had a fighter
[00:49:53] I was training for a fight and I was like, hey, let's do some groundwork. You know, with you on the
[00:50:02] bottom and the dude was strong. It wasn't a good wrestler. Well, let me say a decent wrestler, but not
[00:50:10] by any stretch, you know, not a competitive college wrestler or anything like that, but solid, strong,
[00:50:16] very strong. I said, hey, man, let's put you on the bottom and the response was, I'm not going to
[00:50:23] be on the bottom. Good. Yeah. Hey, well, even if you don't think you're going to be on the bottom,
[00:50:31] let's train for the unlikely event that you happen to end up on the bottom because it's a fight
[00:50:36] and anything can happen. I don't need to. I'm not going to be on the bottom. So we can tell where
[00:50:42] the story is going. Yeah. You went to his fight and fought and was on the bottom basically the
[00:50:46] whole fight. It was a free round fight. It was on the bottom on this whole time. So it was horrible.
[00:50:50] Yeah. And why? Because you can't, you can't neglect one part of the possibilities that can unfold.
[00:50:59] And even even for us, when we would get ready to deploy to Iraq, we're going to Iraq,
[00:51:05] we're literally going to a desert and going to be in the middle of the desert. And we would still
[00:51:10] do dive operations. We'd still do maritime operations while we were getting ready to deploy. Why?
[00:51:16] Because we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know whether what next war is going to break out.
[00:51:21] So just don't neglect anything. And I'll tell you what else. If you're good at a variety of things,
[00:51:30] you will be better at everything. So if all we knew how to do is enter rooms. What happens when
[00:51:38] when we enter a building instead of being a bunch of rooms is a giant warehouse. So it needs to be
[00:51:43] clear. Like, you got to think about these things. But the more flexible you are, the more capabilities
[00:51:48] you have, that's what I'm looking for. The more capabilities you have, the more flexibility you have.
[00:51:53] So learn different skill sets. Don't neglect things. Continuing on preparing to remove an enemy
[00:52:04] battalion that is captured a 40-story skyscraper, a college campus is much different than
[00:52:09] always a much different mission than getting the enemy squad out of a house school or church in a
[00:52:13] small town. The common factor in all these variations, however, is that in all cases, in urban combat
[00:52:20] structures dominate the terrain. Studying and assessing terrain is a fundamental issue for marine
[00:52:26] commanders when planning mission. This idea of terrain is so important. The way the advantage
[00:52:36] that terrain gives you is, I don't know what to compare it to in other in anything else. If you
[00:52:44] understand terrain, you can dominate. It's like trying to do due to a not understanding arm position.
[00:52:53] Like, where that you need underhooks. If you're going against people, I don't understand
[00:52:57] unhooks, you will destroy them. If you're going to get someone that doesn't understand
[00:53:02] where to position their hands, where to position their arms, you will destroy them. If you're
[00:53:06] going against someone that doesn't understand how to utilize a terrain, you will destroy them.
[00:53:10] If you don't know how to utilize the terrain, you will get destroyed. And by the way, that doesn't
[00:53:16] matter if you're in the city or in rural environment, doesn't matter where you are.
[00:53:24] Studying and assessing terrain is a fundamental issue from marine commanders when planning missions.
[00:53:28] This is even more critical in planning house-to-house combat operations. Building materials
[00:53:32] very worldwide and their ability to provide small arms cover to a very high degree.
[00:53:37] Through the use of reconnaissance and intelligence, we recommend conducting a serious assessment
[00:53:41] of each building or structure that is within your unit's area of operations.
[00:53:46] Because tactics involved in taking each objective, building, structure, etc.
[00:53:51] Maybe different in each case. A small wood frame house may offer the illusion of cover
[00:53:56] from small arms, fire, but little else. In some places, walls are paper thin.
[00:54:01] Even houses that use some form of plaster or concrete construction can prove to be
[00:54:05] unexpectedly porous and at the worst possible times. This is something to consider all the time.
[00:54:16] Things are not always what they seem. That's what's important there.
[00:54:21] Things are not always what they seem. You think you're hiding behind a wall and now you're safe.
[00:54:25] No, bullets will go right through it. Continuing, know the basic layout of a structure as
[00:54:32] much as possible before entry. This is something that I would say our standard operating procedures
[00:54:38] in the US military now are so good that we don't really need to know the layout of a structure.
[00:54:45] We're going to go in and be able to handle whatever the structure, however the structure is laid out.
[00:54:51] That's what we do. If you don't train to enter rooms regularly and you don't train to enter buildings
[00:55:00] and you don't train to be able to contend with all these varieties of things that you could face,
[00:55:05] you won't be able to. If you try and say, okay, we need to know what the building looks like inside
[00:55:09] before you go in there that's a horrible idea. It's not going to happen. And by the way, when you go
[00:55:14] in there, the first thing you're going to come across is a barricade. When you can't go down the hallway
[00:55:18] and you've got to go through these other rooms that you weren't expecting. Continuing, approaching
[00:55:24] structure with an entry plan and a search plan and make sure each member of the fire team in
[00:55:29] squad is well versed in these plans. What I say instead of that, it's not plans. These are standard operating
[00:55:34] procedures. You develop standard operating procedures so you know what to do when you end
[00:55:38] rebuilding and so does everyone on the team. Establish voice codes and commands and communicate
[00:55:44] regularly with each other. Yes. Consider entry ways, existing doors and windows to be extremely
[00:55:50] dangerous, likely locations for Ruby traps and to be avoided if at all possible. Wherever possible,
[00:55:55] blow entry holes using satchel charges or rockets. Once the entry plan is finalized and understood,
[00:56:00] it must be executed with fierce determination. Be prepared for anything and be ready to improvise.
[00:56:08] Be systematic and check everything basements sewer, access, add-X rooftop trash cans,
[00:56:14] thoroughly before establishing that the objective is secure. So what I want the most important
[00:56:18] things I take away from that is that the existing entry ways you got to consider them dangerous.
[00:56:26] How do we translate that into life? What that means is these well-established patterns are exactly
[00:56:33] that and I'm not saying you can't ever use a pattern that someone else used but you at least at a
[00:56:40] minimum have to be aware of the fact that when you're doing something, when you're using a path
[00:56:46] that someone else is already gone down, it's a known path. So you can't expect to be able to surprise
[00:56:55] your competitor when you're doing something that's always been done the same way. Go to.
[00:56:59] Think of how you can approach things in a different manner and if in fact that manner might be
[00:57:05] better. Sometimes you look at things from a different angle and you realize that the reason that
[00:57:10] everyone does it this way is because that's the best possible way and to make some huge
[00:57:14] hurty lean effort to try and do something to just to be different sometimes that's the wrong answer.
[00:57:20] I get that but consider it. Yeah a lot of times those the sweet and like certain industries are
[00:57:27] like this but I'm gonna name them but they're so used to doing it a certain way because that's
[00:57:33] sort of like what they learned. Yeah it's all for sure. It's almost like as an industry they don't
[00:57:37] think of like what why they're doing it that way. Well yeah that's why that's why there's been
[00:57:43] so many disruptors right in the last few years. I mean you can look at any of these
[00:57:49] disruptors companies that are come out of nowhere that you know you can look at the
[00:57:54] ride sharing applications. If you were a taxi driver you were thinking okay how can we get more
[00:58:00] dispatchers how can I hire more cars. These you know these ride sharing people said oh we're not
[00:58:06] gonna own any cars. Same with Airbnb right we're not gonna build a hotel we're gonna use a random
[00:58:15] people's houses and put you in there that's looking at it from a completely different angle.
[00:58:21] Seeing a problem and coming up with a completely different solution if you looked at a city and said oh
[00:58:26] wow there's no rooms in that city there's no hotel rooms in that city where am I gonna put
[00:58:30] everyone okay well let's do whatever one else does. We'll build a building and we'll put rooms in there
[00:58:36] and we'll staff the building and we'll put a restaurant. That's what you do. That's what's been done.
[00:58:41] Guess what? Someone else looked at that and said you know there's nowhere to stay in that city
[00:58:48] but some people might have empty rooms in their house. Let's let's see if we can access those.
[00:58:53] Yeah boom there you go. Yeah I wonder how it was that where the guy would want to look at you
[00:58:57] like hey shoot I can't find a hotel room when I go to San Francisco and then the friend was like hey
[00:59:03] just come say with me. And then when he stayed with them he was like you know next time you come
[00:59:08] if you can't find a hotel room you can always stay with me. But I call yeah hey I'm not the only one
[00:59:12] right away I'm coming up here I'm coming up on you know my company's pay me come up here so
[00:59:17] I can get them you know they'll give me money for the room so maybe I could just pay you. Yeah
[00:59:21] and you go oh cool we're kind of kind of getting a little help us kick back for the company. Yeah cool and
[00:59:27] then the next thing you know hey I bet other cities have I know a guy down the road he has room
[00:59:33] because really you so if you have any co-workers or no and if you know anybody you know that guy too
[00:59:37] oh simple as that yeah simple as that but it's looking at it from a different angle
[00:59:45] so look at things from a different angle then what you come up you know fierce determination
[00:59:51] fierce determination is always good yeah makes sense there are dichotomy it's a fierce determination
[00:59:56] yes there is can you have someone that's two fierce lead determination. First lead determined yes you can
[01:00:03] yes you can they don't know when to stop me next the other aspect of urban terrain are the
[01:00:14] spaces between building streets alleys and other pathways are normal routes for humans and therefore
[01:00:20] must be suspected to be under observation and possible enemy firing lanes whenever possible
[01:00:28] take the most difficult route from house to house same thing we just talked about look for a different path
[01:00:36] established and then and there's obviously there's a dichotomy to that because if you're constantly
[01:00:41] just taking a hard road all the time you might not make any progress it's also bad.
[01:00:45] establishing advanced a plan of what to do and the event non-combatants are found in urban zones
[01:00:51] and from marking buildings that have been cleared it's kind of crazy that they didn't have
[01:00:55] an idea of how they were going to mark buildings that were cleared. Continuing make absolutely
[01:01:02] sure that your Marines are aware that while inside of building being secured they are at risk
[01:01:07] from both within and without always assume that every room of every floor in each and every house
[01:01:14] contains enemy soldiers always move very quickly when moving in front of windows or
[01:01:20] doorways always know where enemy positions may be in buildings that are adjacent to yours
[01:01:25] as in all marine operations watching your buddies back watch your buddies back and run as fast as
[01:01:31] possible when traversing open ground can't let your guard down. Can't let your guard down.
[01:01:43] Where do you let your guard down? Yeah. Can't tell you. It's probably a pretty broad area.
[01:01:50] 100% of my life. Is there any time where you feel like hey I need to get my guard up?
[01:01:57] This is probably an easier question for you. You're not just running around hyper paranoid like I am.
[01:02:03] Yeah. Yeah. What? In life? You mean or in GG2? Like everything? Yeah. Like oh,
[01:02:11] I don't know. It put it this way my guard's always up but it's only kind of up. I think you know it's like a
[01:02:18] 25% and it flak kind of fluctuates from moment to moment. Luxuates up from like zero.
[01:02:24] It stays at 25 sometimes it goes up to like 30. Yeah. Certain scenarios. Yeah. Check.
[01:02:30] Multiple story structures present in even greater challenge in single story buildings in medium-sized
[01:02:35] village or town or small city that is dominated by one two and three story buildings be very
[01:02:40] particular about the taller buildings which are naturally used by the enemy as high ground.
[01:02:46] If possible make entry to taller multi-level buildings via the roof and works systematically
[01:02:51] and thoroughly downward always look for the high ground. So is that the thing you know because
[01:02:58] yeah the high ground kind of seems simple straightforward or whatever but is there like a
[01:03:06] blueprint like a simple blueprint for like I remember you told me a story where your son was talking
[01:03:13] with like a neighbor or something who had I don't know if you want to Vietnam or something like
[01:03:18] he was in using the military whatever and you get and they played like laser tag or something
[01:03:22] and you sound like whooped him because he knew like something. Well yeah my son knew some fundamental
[01:03:29] tactics. His own energy younger so he wasn't really up to speed yet he was like seven or six
[01:03:36] but you know not up to us. We started you know he was he was already through I think
[01:03:41] I think it was through level seven of my tactical course
[01:03:44] um yeah he's probably around level seven. What tactical course just I have like some tactical lessons
[01:03:51] that I run you know what I mean that you run like as a father or as a what like echelon front
[01:03:57] has a tactical course like what do you know I have tactical concepts that I teach.
[01:04:01] How do you teach? Well I can't teach me nothing. You know you're all being over there 25%
[01:04:08] because you know that's just the standard you know if you know so there's certain things you have to learn
[01:04:13] in order to be attacked to be proficient and I my son had learned like I'd gone through seven of the
[01:04:19] courses to understand the tactical things and there was a friend of my wife's friend came over.
[01:04:28] He yes he was prior uh Marine actually he was active duty Marine and yes my son challenged him to a
[01:04:36] laser tag competition and yes my son was victorious three times in a row and in the
[01:04:44] he just did simple fundamental tactics and it wasn't even team at sporters one on one.
[01:04:49] So how do you defeat someone one on one? Well you maneuver very quickly you don't fire from the
[01:04:56] same same position multiple times you get the high ground because you like he knew if you get
[01:05:03] onto my garage roof which had access with a ladder you're gonna be able to defend that position
[01:05:10] very thoroughly and the person that's below you because all you have to do when you're on the
[01:05:13] garage roof is dark and you're hidden it's a parapet roof so you're all you if there's a deck up
[01:05:19] there yeah there's one access point how are you gonna beat me you don't have grenades with the
[01:05:23] late you don't laser grenades so I have the high ground yeah I'm seven years old or six years old
[01:05:30] I have the high ground I have a laser weapon you're trying to attack me you're gonna die yeah and then
[01:05:35] the next round when you're trying to get up on that thing I'm not there anymore yeah I'm in the alley
[01:05:40] way up the alley way up behind the fence higher still higher still so the high ground is kind of like
[01:05:47] the golden go through yeah interesting you know when the first time I found out that the high ground
[01:05:54] is the spot to be where when I watch the movie called the rock you're watching a song Connor in
[01:06:00] Nickle's Gate where the Navy seals come up you know they got to go to Alcatraz they come up through
[01:06:05] the wherever the dream there's something like this yeah and they get you know boom they're
[01:06:10] sort of surprised by the I think they're Marines yeah the Terry they're mercenaries at this point
[01:06:16] but nonetheless or Patriots depend. Patriots right exactly right yeah and he was like hey your
[01:06:22] guys just surrounded it from an elevated position yeah it's kind of like this is a no-brainer you
[01:06:28] know this kind of thing like that's a thing yeah and it is a thing you know how and they and they
[01:06:34] killed them all yeah except for Nicholas Cage he didn't die that's that's chemical agent by the way
[01:06:43] right Vx guys that's that's what I was gonna say yeah but you know that was a real or you
[01:06:48] all right yeah let's face it's president just dive deep right into that I was gonna let me know
[01:06:54] this little pearl the little pearl balls they're kind of yeah interesting back to the book
[01:07:03] the mission assigned to Marine forces during Operation Away City was to remove enemy forces that
[01:07:08] it captured major sections of the ancient imperial capital of way during the surprise and VA offensive
[01:07:14] that was quickly dubbed the Tad Offensive due to the historic listen closely due to the historic
[01:07:20] aspect of many of the buildings in way the usage of heavy weapons was significantly restricted
[01:07:25] during the initial days of fighting on both sides of the river as friendly casualties mounted
[01:07:31] and as initial estimates of the size of the enemy force in a way city area was significantly
[01:07:38] increased fire restrictions were ultimately lifted so they didn't want to damage these historical
[01:07:45] buildings and so they said hey don't don't use 50 cal don't use group whatever whatever
[01:07:51] weapons they said they couldn't use and then eventually when the casualties got so bad they said
[01:07:57] okay go ahead and do what you got to do I say rip the bandade off right if you're gonna go
[01:08:04] you go if you're gonna go go don't play around that's a good lesson America learns over and
[01:08:14] over and over again if you're gonna go to war go to win your number one priority over everything
[01:08:19] else should be doing and by the way if they would have done that I guarantee this city would have
[01:08:23] been a better shape at the end because the enemy is gonna drag this thing out and it's gonna take
[01:08:28] longer than you're gonna have to end up destroying every single building that's there yeah make sense they
[01:08:34] continue in our respectful opinion our ability to successfully complete the mission was initially
[01:08:40] severely impacted by the rules of engagement again this is a lack of trust up and down the chain
[01:08:46] equipment if I have to impose strict rules of engagement on my people I haven't trained them well
[01:08:51] enough I don't trust them they don't trust me they don't understand the strategic mission
[01:08:56] and we have a real problem continuing although it is understood that mission and rules
[01:09:05] engagement are not the exclusive responsibility of marine leadership at the cartoon company
[01:09:09] battalion or even regimental level it is strongly recommended that every effort is made at
[01:09:15] every level in the chain of command to ensure that balance has been achieved between the demands
[01:09:21] of the mission and the effect of the rules of engagement on the ability of the command to
[01:09:26] perform the mission successfully yes you do have to have balance but what you really should have
[01:09:35] is trust and understanding of the situation so that people don't need to be constrained by rules
[01:09:45] if I have if my leaders understand what I want them to do
[01:09:50] and they understand the constraints and they understand the mission and they understand the
[01:09:55] impact they don't need any rules at all they just need to get told to go yeah I think about
[01:10:01] like certain laws where if this is going to be the law the land that this law applies to
[01:10:08] everybody same thing with rules of engagement where they got it because they kind of got
[01:10:12] applied to everyone right in a certain way so that's why they wind up being so strict or they can
[01:10:18] and I'm thinking about laws too where there's certain groups or individuals that's like man
[01:10:24] that law kind of shouldn't apply to me because I know better you know but where like you know
[01:10:29] like the guy who's like okay on quiet is this red light right this is or this stop light
[01:10:34] not quite where the cross road of that stop light is a dirt road and on both and if you turn
[01:10:41] in the dirt road either direction there's a gate that's always closed it's only click hope that
[01:10:45] it's for like cane trucks and stuff or it was I don't know what it is down but and the cane
[01:10:50] truck guys have the key to the gate there's big long get you can't even turn in there but there's
[01:10:54] still a stop light right so it's never red because it only turns green when the kid but
[01:11:00] everyone's gonna all be red and the gate will be closed you know you know that sort of happens
[01:11:05] and here's the thing you can see the gate's quote no truck is coming even if a truck was
[01:11:09] coming like they got a stop that opened the gate whatever should you stay at that red stop light
[01:11:14] or can you just blow through the light you would think any responsible adult should have
[01:11:21] the authority or whatever to see that and just go through the light right but the rules got
[01:11:27] applied everybody that's the thing has to apply to everyone what about the new driver who's like
[01:11:32] they can discern quite as well where a safe red light running situation versus a not so safe red
[01:11:40] light running situation and then there's a spectrum you know so when these rules get put in place
[01:11:45] they gotta apply to everybody the lowest common denominator person and unfortunately these highest
[01:11:52] higher denominational people gotta apply to them too because you know you can't just go down
[01:11:59] the line and be like okay this rule applies to you but kind of kind of you know just maybe 30
[01:12:03] percent this rule applies to him 100 percent of course and him too you 1 percent because you're
[01:12:09] this elite dude so you can you know you have ultimate like you know it's hard to do that
[01:12:13] especially when you do a like a bunch of people so that's why that can be a pain and that sometimes
[01:12:18] you seem to say you're apparently that's been bothered you for quite some well
[01:12:21] how long you live in America for or on this main land like think about like the court system
[01:12:27] or like you know yeah no well rules will get put in place for sure
[01:12:31] because people don't trust the subordinates that have to fall the rule right you tell your kids
[01:12:40] you're not allowed to go in the yard because the pools out there right what you're really saying
[01:12:44] is I don't trust that you're not going to go in the pool or I don't trust that you're that you can
[01:12:49] swim all enough if you're a good leader you'll be like okay we got it we need to work on this you
[01:12:52] can understand the dangers that's a little bit of a weird thing to talk about because drum and
[01:12:56] a pool for a little kid you obviously have to air towards the side of safety that's probably not
[01:12:59] the best example but if you tell your kid no one's allowed to come okay I'm going on a trip
[01:13:05] Friday night no one come over to the house those are the rules right you know if my kids
[01:13:11] actually understood what I really meant is like hey if you want to have a couple kids over
[01:13:14] that's cool don't get crazy don't eat my food no weird stay away from the milk no weirdos no
[01:13:19] you know if they understood all that which actually that's what my kids were like okay
[01:13:23] got a couple kids coming over it's all good yeah if they broke the trust
[01:13:27] then things might be different then I have to go and implement rules yeah but on top of that
[01:13:34] you're to you're talking about like your kids or like you know in the military if you're dealing
[01:13:38] with like one unit or one little group of people but if the rules of engagement or in your
[01:13:43] case like the rule of people coming over what if what if it didn't just apply to your kids what
[01:13:48] if it applied to the whole block or the whole town or whatever so it's like just to keep everyone safe
[01:13:53] we got to set this is the standard which is why we don't want communism because they just make
[01:13:59] rules that are blank it over everyone well that's how laws are even here you know like the gun laws
[01:14:04] consider the gun laws first they're like hey we need background check but the good rules
[01:14:07] got to apply to everyone you know you can't like discriminate kind of thing you they have to
[01:14:12] apply to everybody so it's like man well yeah that's the gun rules are a perfect example
[01:14:17] because they don't trust the the people everyone yeah certain people yeah oh everyone just can't
[01:14:25] have a gun you have to get a background check okay fair enough why but then it goes then it continues
[01:14:31] see that's that's where that's where you run into progress where so much debate about gun laws
[01:14:34] because pretty much everyone says hey I get it you should probably get some kind of a background
[01:14:39] check before you get a firearm everyone goes hmm okay I don't want somebody that's been
[01:14:44] I don't want somebody that's a felon or a violent criminal to be able to get a gun cool I agree with
[01:14:48] that the problem is where does it stop and and then the problem on top of that is
[01:14:55] because of the where does it stop because of the slippery slope thing the people that don't want
[01:15:02] any gun laws they just say we don't want any like every single you know well we think we're
[01:15:07] the background check should be an extra three days no way yeah and meanwhile on the other side
[01:15:14] people are saying every single thing that they can do to restrict firearms from being
[01:15:20] had by anybody they try and move it there so both sides are just take an extreme position
[01:15:27] and no one will actually have a normal logical conversation about what's going on yeah it's just
[01:15:33] and even when you do men it is you're like in screaming yes and that and from the polar polarised
[01:15:39] positions yeah and a lot of times even if you're in that in the moment like you can step back and see
[01:15:44] that when that happens when people are just like hey you're just defending your position just
[01:15:48] just kind of blindly or whatever you can see that happen I'm not saying like it's so terrible
[01:15:52] and it's natural I get it but even if you can have like a civilized discussion it's still hard
[01:15:58] because it's based on people yeah because people get because like for me I should absolutely
[01:16:07] be able to have whatever guns I want right that's that's the way I feel I feel that I should
[01:16:14] be able to and I yes you can check my background you can see if I am a felon or a violent criminal
[01:16:20] you can see that I'm not okay you should be able to I should be able to get whatever guns I want
[01:16:26] and but there's some people that think hey you know but as strong as I feel about that as
[01:16:32] strong as I feel like I should be able to what get whatever guns I want if someone says oh well
[01:16:40] then you agree that everyone should be able to get every gun they want to know actually I don't
[01:16:44] agree with that I think that there's some people that don't need guns I can say that I can say
[01:16:51] that without without thinking without saying oh well jocco believes in gun control for everyone it's
[01:16:58] like no I just said what I believed so the rules are about trust and you have to figure out where
[01:17:05] the trust lies with everyone and you have to figure out what the minimum amount of trust is that
[01:17:11] you can overlay on people everywhere and that's where that's why governing a giant country is so
[01:17:16] hard and depending on where you live to because depending on where you live you have different needs
[01:17:22] you have different like there's some people that live yeah there's the culture's different but
[01:17:26] depending on where you live like if you live in a state where there's predatory animals
[01:17:32] and you live out in the bush somewhere you're you're damn right you need guns if you live in a
[01:17:37] state where there's predatory animals that are human beings that will break in your house and
[01:17:41] kill you guess what you also need to be able to protect your family that's good to go you know
[01:17:49] somebody asked me their days like is is is is actually Tim is actually Tim Ferris who's asking me if
[01:17:56] Pepper spray is good home defense I'm like Pepper spray is good home defense against a person that
[01:18:03] isn't carrying a weapon I said but if someone's breaking into your house or coming to attack you
[01:18:09] are they not going to have a weapon do are they following some kind of a rules of engagement where
[01:18:14] they're I'm going on a basic being a tonight I'm only going to bring you know I'm only going to
[01:18:20] bring my my pillow to hit people I know they're asking your house to kill you or they're breaking
[01:18:25] your house to to assault your family yeah whatever they're breaking in your house to they shouldn't
[01:18:30] be breaking in your house and they're probably going to be able to defend themselves because they
[01:18:34] don't want to get caught so what do they do to protect your family so as they got a knife or
[01:18:37] they got on whatever they got to go in the name so Pepper spray great the problem with Pepper spray is
[01:18:43] you don't you don't they're not following rules of engagement there's a rules of engagement
[01:18:47] yeah that's a good question too but like Pepper spray why would you use like think of a
[01:18:53] real scenario where you would use Pepper spray as a as a human the girl I get it because you have
[01:18:58] valuable goods regardless of where you go you know you can be at the post stuff you still got those
[01:19:02] valuable goods that that predators might want as a girl but let's say okay I'm too far as or
[01:19:08] I'm you know I'm me or whatever why when would I use the Pepper spray realistic I'm sure
[01:19:12] I think I'm just asking that because it's a legitimate question because if someone says look I'm
[01:19:18] not really comfortable with guns but if someone wants comes into my house I want to be able to defend
[01:19:22] myself I'm going to get Pepper spray and the the real quick answer is like yeah okay cool yeah
[01:19:27] better than not it makes you go oh that kind of makes sense right at least you got something
[01:19:32] the reality is the person's coming to your house it's Pepper spray is great as long as they don't have
[01:19:37] a knife yeah as long as they don't have a gun in which case the Pepper spray is doing you know good
[01:19:43] yeah because you Pepper spray me and I have a knife I'm going to grab a hold of you I'm going to
[01:19:48] come and cut your head off right in a situation that you you got to use the Pepper spray so like
[01:19:53] if someone's like burglarizing you and you turn on the light and they scatter you don't need the
[01:19:57] Pepper spray for that kind of situation you know Pepper spray is for someone who like whoa yeah but
[01:20:01] you don't know that they're gonna scatter yeah just like you don't know if they have a gun or not
[01:20:06] yes yeah yeah and if you're prowling around in someone's house you're going to be in a
[01:20:12] serious situation yeah I think you should be yeah you're going to be in real bad situation yeah so
[01:20:18] that's what rules are and rules of engagement so going back we're trying to bring this back rules
[01:20:23] of engagement that's exactly that's exactly why rules of engagement can be tricky but they shouldn't
[01:20:28] be if you train your people well if the people understand what the strategic mission if they
[01:20:33] understand what the parameters you put the parameters in there and they're loosening off that people
[01:20:36] can maneuver inside those parameters then occasionally they got to call you up and say hey I
[01:20:42] had to break the rules and you say oh what happened and they explained it to you go okay good call yeah
[01:20:46] yeah people need to understand that continuing on urban combat is nearly always conducted at
[01:20:57] very close quarters it is not uncommon to have opposing forces fighting from positions a few
[01:21:01] dozen meters apart most of the fighting is done from a distance between 50 and 500 meters due to this
[01:21:07] close in nature it is critical to know where the enemy is and how they are deployed again this is a
[01:21:13] fantasy like knowing where the enemy is and how they're deployed is really hard to do even when
[01:21:19] you have even when you have overhead coverage looking in the city I'll tell you an example I was
[01:21:26] watching my guys out on a mission I was watching on a UAV feed so we're watching we're watching
[01:21:35] and looking for enemy and all of a sudden we see weird activities of vehicle the vehicle stops
[01:21:41] the vehicle kind of moves a little bit stops again guys get out they look around open up the trunk
[01:21:48] and now we're totally focused like oh these guys are getting ready to attack open up the trunk
[01:21:53] and as they're starting to pull stuff out of the trunk my guys get hit from a different spot
[01:21:57] that we weren't looking because you can't see everything especially in a city because think of it
[01:22:01] with buildings as soon as you go off angle a little bit you can't see the street anymore because it's
[01:22:07] down in the building so we actually are totally focused on this one thing and maneuvering the
[01:22:13] the air asset to look at these people in a car and as as they're as we're monitoring these
[01:22:20] guys these suspected enemy personnel I'll send my guys get shot at from somewhere else and we
[01:22:25] completely miss it and we continue to watch these guys and they pull out a jack and a tire and they
[01:22:33] lift up the car and they change the tire and they leave but like you just normal but it looked
[01:22:38] very suspect so to think that you're ever gonna know where the enemy is and how they're
[01:22:43] deployed is very very challenging at best you do the best it doesn't mean you don't try
[01:22:47] you definitely try but you you don't get all that information you just don't get it
[01:22:51] hey those UAVs how high are those depends on the UAV so like can they see them like can
[01:22:59] people see them or are they just depends on the UAV and like I don't know what the classification
[01:23:04] of all that stuff is so I'm not talking about it good I don't know what the I just know that
[01:23:08] they go a different heights I'll leave it at that yeah well because on the internet you can see
[01:23:12] those you know those videos every once in a while they feel just have them yeah then it's like
[01:23:16] dang those guys don't even see that or you know I don't know if they do or don't go to optics too
[01:23:22] like real good optics I mean just imagine you know the optics that we have in the civilian sector
[01:23:26] yeah even those are good enough to be pretty amazing yeah so
[01:23:33] talk about knowing where the enemy is this lesson was learned a hard way during the initial
[01:23:36] stages of the battle inside the Citadel during the first two major clashes between
[01:23:40] marine and NVA forces on the morning of 13 February 1968 the enemy surprised us and
[01:23:45] reaped significant damages very quickly this is because we weren't exactly sure where they were
[01:23:51] although the the arvine which the south-eutomy's army had been in several major battles inside the
[01:23:58] Citadel I don't recall receiving any intelligence attributed to them regarding the enemy's
[01:24:04] exact location further to my knowledge no marine recon unit was sent to check out the situation
[01:24:09] before attacking on the morning of the 13th so that's rough and I'll tell you one thing that
[01:24:16] from my mind where's the enemy the enemy's everywhere that you have to approach things as if the enemy
[01:24:21] can be anywhere and the only way you can know that they're not where they're not everywhere is when you
[01:24:26] take something down and you secure it that's when you're not there then you move on we recommend that
[01:24:32] all intelligence assets recon units and surveillance devices that can be made available are deployed
[01:24:37] in a significant effort to fix the exact location of enemy soldiers and units again this is
[01:24:42] you can see where this is coming out of this for these guys they must have been completely outflanked all the
[01:24:48] time where they were thinking where is the enemy we need to know where the enemy is and it's a really
[01:24:53] hard to know that the enemy can bat who knows where his enemy is hiding experiences this
[01:24:59] experiences a decided advantage in surprise and the deployment of firepower of course
[01:25:06] now again this doesn't like I'm saying it's hard to have definitely doesn't mean you
[01:25:10] mitigate it doesn't mean you don't put up UAV so you can see maneuver doesn't mean you don't
[01:25:14] gather intelligence doesn't mean people shouldn't report back and and explain where they
[01:25:17] think the enemy is so we at least have an estimate hmm continuing the combat urban combat tactics
[01:25:25] the tragedy of urban conflict is that the battlefield for each firefight is a neighborhood each objective
[01:25:31] taken is someone's home or a school or church or some other structure that has value and
[01:25:36] more or less significant meaning to its inhabitants considering the possibilities it is not difficult
[01:25:42] to imagine tank battles across mall parking lots mortar fire hitting a church a hospital
[01:25:48] community center heavy small arms fire fights between homes and artillery barrage on a school yard
[01:25:54] while these images may be grist for the mills of Hollywood when we think about them in relevance to
[01:26:01] our homes and our neighborhood schools and churches the tragedy is somehow increased however
[01:26:08] it is our collective belief that the life of one marine is more precious than 10 100 homes
[01:26:15] schools churches shrines shopping malls or any other building known demand
[01:26:23] therefore all efforts should be made using any and all weaponry available to stun the enemy and
[01:26:28] support marine advances through the use of supporting arms and without regard to damage to buildings
[01:26:37] so clearly the whole idea that this started off with of the rules and engagement that we're
[01:26:43] restricting heavy firepower because the historical nature of the city a if you don't want
[01:26:48] historical buildings destroyed don't have a war and if you think we should save a building
[01:26:58] and that's gonna cost the life of one of our brothers not happening continuing at the same time
[01:27:06] the use of heavy weaponry and urban combat is an assuredly two-edged sword as our many assets in
[01:27:12] modern warfare rubble can be nearly as effective as a building for protecting enemy firing positions
[01:27:20] further artillery and other flat trajectory weapons may be somewhat restricted by the
[01:27:24] height of buildings and their distance from each other in many cases mortars although smaller
[01:27:29] in caliber were superior because of their higher trajectory so interestingly indirect fire
[01:27:39] indirect fire taking the indirect approach is often better than the flat trajectory
[01:27:45] I'm gonna shoot through your front door no we're gonna lob in some rounds on you so so we think about
[01:27:50] that when we're dealing with people punching them in the face is not as good as coming from an
[01:27:55] indirect position where they don't quite see where it's coming from but it still gives them a little
[01:28:00] crack and it's even to the point where he says the even though they're smaller in caliber so even though
[01:28:08] somebody does something that you want to straighten them out on when you hear them in the face
[01:28:13] we know what the reaction is they get defensive all that things when we come from from a flank
[01:28:18] or indirect fire it's smaller caliber not even as it's doesn't hate as hard but it's more effective
[01:28:24] yeah just more effective in the rectifier all day long continuing supporting arms supporting arms
[01:28:33] the most effective our most effective prior to danger close to minimize the potential of
[01:28:36] friendly casualties and maximize preparatory fires to support the infantry's attack during
[01:28:42] operation way city the most effective indirect fire during danger close was from an
[01:28:46] eight inch gun we recommend that the supporting access of fire be perpendicular as well as parallel
[01:28:51] finally in the event as in the case of operation way city that due to political considerations
[01:28:56] that proper preparatory fires would not be allowed that a variety of artillery fires such a
[01:29:02] smoke delayed fuses high angle can be incorporated with the infantry's attack combined arms
[01:29:07] training for urban combat as critical it's covered move that's what supporting arms
[01:29:16] do they lay down cover so you can maneuver it other advantage of preparatory firing
[01:29:21] include the destruction over the camouflage of enemy positions the psychological shock factor
[01:29:26] against enemy troops and the fact that heavy weapons can create new avenues of attack and
[01:29:30] egress for armored vehicles pretty straightforward one of the most effective aspects of
[01:29:38] supporting arms during the battle of way were the killer teams that evolved the M48 tank and the
[01:29:45] antos and the antos is like a it's it's actually a pretty crazy looking machine it's got
[01:29:51] 160 16 millimeter like cannons on it and it's got six of them and they're kind of like sticky now
[01:29:58] and it's a light armored vehicle it's like a tank anti tank vehicle but um
[01:30:03] antos were pair up and maneuver together as a team this would allow either the tank or the
[01:30:07] antos to maneuver into a good fire position where while the other covered cover move.
[01:30:14] Thank you further the devastating fire power put out by the 90 millimeter tank cannon and the
[01:30:20] six one oh six is of the antos turned out to be extremely beneficial because their capabilities
[01:30:24] to deliver pinpoint fire power armored vehicles can provide many benefits to the infantry
[01:30:30] engaged in urban combat as they provide some cover from enemy small arms fire however armored vehicles
[01:30:38] can also become rocket magnets producing casualties for infantry troops in close proximity.
[01:30:43] The enemy's gonna see that target and they're gonna like it.
[01:30:50] Yeah and there's advantages to having that power but there's also disadvantages so you have to
[01:30:55] always weigh those things out as a leader you have to pay attention to those things.
[01:30:59] As a leader you have to think of every advantage that you have there's gonna be some
[01:31:03] negative to it there's gonna be some disadvantage when you bring an advantage to table there's
[01:31:07] gonna be some disadvantage. And you get to right if you're gonna be super flexible you're not that strong.
[01:31:12] Yeah if you're gonna be super strong you're not that flexible. Your cardio doesn't last very long.
[01:31:16] Right so there's gonna be advantages and disadvantages that come with each asset that you have.
[01:31:22] So you have to think you're gonna go for full ox that's cool you're giving up position.
[01:31:26] There's all kinds of things you have to weigh those out and as a leader you have to look at.
[01:31:30] Don't get wrapped around the positives of something.
[01:31:32] Great just the positives. There's not just positives for for really anything.
[01:31:37] Yeah there's nothing that's just straight positives across the board. I guess right?
[01:31:43] I'm sure we could think of something. Yeah and I'm sure you could.
[01:31:50] Continue other than instances of harassment and introduction fires buildings that are hit by heavy weapons
[01:31:55] should be attacked immediately. This is good. Buildings that are hit by heavy weapons should be attacked immediately.
[01:32:01] Don't hesitate. You catch people off guard don't hesitate. Don't hesitate. This happens
[01:32:07] this happens in everything. We get a good position or something and advantage just happens and we
[01:32:13] hesitate instead of taking advantage of the advantage. We go, oh god of here. Yeah.
[01:32:18] And then then we let it go. It happens in business too. We get to a situation.
[01:32:23] Oh we finally get the we finally get our competitor to make a mistake.
[01:32:29] Or we get an advantage position and we celebrate instead of just finishing the job. Yeah. Which is a big bad thing to do.
[01:32:41] Remember that when calling and fire missions you can request splash so you're friendly
[01:32:45] troops have time to take cover immediately prior to impact. These guys were calling bombs right
[01:32:49] on top of a lot. In daytime operations the use of covering smoke is often helpful when
[01:32:55] Marines pass the attack across open areas. As was learned during Operation Ways City even with
[01:33:03] proper support of heavy weapons which was ultimately provided to the Marines we faced hard
[01:33:08] core north for Vietnamese army troops who fought from prepared positions and moved to secondary
[01:33:13] positions fought again and finally very reluctantly died. In the capture of each room, each floor,
[01:33:20] each rooftop each building each street. It was ultimately the Marine riflemen who won the battle.
[01:33:31] It's as a leader. As a leader, do you always have to remember that line right there?
[01:33:39] In the capture of each room each floor, each rooftop each building each street. It was
[01:33:43] ultimately the Marine riflemen who won the battle. As a leader, if you think that all you need to
[01:33:52] do is make a good decision and then you're going to win your wrong. The folks on the front line
[01:33:58] have to truly understand what is happening and there are the ones that are going to carry the day.
[01:34:05] And you could come up with a best battle plan ever. You could come up with a best strategic business
[01:34:09] plan ever and if you don't have folks that are engaged and willing and are going to take the
[01:34:14] fight to the enemy and are going to win that foothold. They're going to enter that room.
[01:34:21] They're going to go out and sell into whatever industry you're trying to get into.
[01:34:25] If you don't have people that you trust that are trained that are ready that are prepared,
[01:34:31] if you don't have them, best battle plan in the world isn't going to work. It's critical for
[01:34:40] infantry units. No both the capabilities as well as the limitations of supporting arms.
[01:34:47] Know your limitations. This is again, there's positives and there's negatives.
[01:34:54] Another aspect of supporting arms, limitations has to do with helicopter support.
[01:34:58] Urban terrain is not very forgiving to helicopters that may be forced to make an emergency landing.
[01:35:03] Helicopter pilots might be reluctant to fly over urban terrain.
[01:35:09] Know these things.
[01:35:12] One very tragic aspect of using supporting arms in urban combat is that the likelihood of civilian
[01:35:18] casualties is very high. In at least two situations that we are aware of, the NVA used civilians as
[01:35:25] screens for their infantry troops and fire missions were of necessity called in on those positions.
[01:35:35] So, no, expect, pre-discuss these things, let your troops understand, put them in role
[01:35:48] place in areas where they have to make a decision on what's happening. It's better to think through it 20 times
[01:35:54] and make 20 mistakes while we're doing some kind of a role-play scenario.
[01:36:00] Then it is to have to make that decision for the first time. When you're on the battlefield
[01:36:04] you can't discuss. You can't debrief.
[01:36:07] Yeah. Not to mention the stress that's going to kind of. Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:12] Use of chemical weapons during one five's battle inside the Citadel fortress which was kicked off
[01:36:19] on 13 February 1968. The battalion progressed at total of four blocks along our avenue of attack
[01:36:25] and head secured at total of 16 city blocks within our assigned area of operations after nearly
[01:36:30] two weeks of heavy street fighting and after suffering nearly 50% casualties at the hands of a
[01:36:35] well-prepared determined force of NVA soldiers, a force that finally estimated that was finally
[01:36:41] estimated to be nearly 11,000 strong in the waste in the waste city area of operations.
[01:36:47] On February 25, 1968, Marines from Charlie Company shot off three E8 gas launchers,
[01:36:55] caring about 40 CS gas grenades toward the enemy's last known position. The next morning,
[01:37:00] one five took control of the remaining 12 city blocks in about three hours without a single
[01:37:05] casualty because the NVA was not equipped to deal with teargrass attack and was forced to withdraw.
[01:37:13] So we're going from 50% casualties to zero.
[01:37:21] Taking a different approach, utilizing weapons that no one was used to utilizing.
[01:37:28] The enemy who had never had not seen, they even have gas masks. They just had to get out of there
[01:37:32] and that E8 gas launcher, it's like a suitcase looking thing and it's got eight tubes that have
[01:37:40] eight rounds at each and them and it fires them like five seconds apart. So we're talking a lot of gas.
[01:37:47] Especially they shot off three of them. You don't want none of that.
[01:37:55] No one can ever be certain that the use of chemical weapons would have made a difference in the
[01:37:58] initial stages of the battle, but many of the veterans of that battle have often wondered what
[01:38:04] might have happened if the E8s had been deployed in the early stages of the battle. We recommend
[01:38:08] the judicious use of chemical weapons such as tear gases, etc. for combat operations.
[01:38:15] A administration planning and preparation, the inherent complexities of urban combat are such
[01:38:20] that special attention needs to be paid toward planning and preparations, training, training,
[01:38:25] practice makes perfect. A coordinated marine attack on an enemy held position in an
[01:38:33] town or city can be equated to an intricate opera or Broadway production, although the stakes are a bit higher.
[01:38:42] Entry techniques, room search and clearing techniques, voice commands indicating movement or
[01:38:46] progress, fire discipline, the use of grenades, rocket supporting fires, communications,
[01:38:51] all of these must be rehearsed and improved until they are second nature.
[01:39:01] Second nature. I was talking to you the other day. You were saying something about
[01:39:08] my guillotine choke that it was there quickly. Yes. Yeah. And I was saying it's second. It's I should
[01:39:18] have said it's second nature because what I did tell you is sometimes I become aware like we'll be
[01:39:25] rolling and all of a sudden I'll be like, oh I've got a guillotine right now. Yeah. I didn't even
[01:39:29] this way just showed up there with zero fought whatsoever. Yeah. Yeah. That's how you need to be.
[01:39:37] If I have to think about putting a guillotine on someone, then that means they have time to think about
[01:39:42] defending. Right. If I didn't even think about it, it just happened. Just sort of. Yeah. And
[01:39:47] didn't. Not to split hairs. It's less about the guillotine specifically. It's just about your
[01:39:52] like what do you call a head control. You know, you know, you get that chin strap. Oh yeah. It's that
[01:39:56] where that just arrives. And then sure it'll become a guillotine for sure. Or a cobra or one of these
[01:40:02] other treacherous moves. Good. You like the implement from time to time. Yeah. But yeah. It's like
[01:40:08] your head. Well, I feel like I feel like it's second nature from my head to just land in there.
[01:40:14] That's what it feels like for sure. But obviously it's your thing. Oh no. But that's the way we want to
[01:40:20] train. That's the way we want to train. And I would say I'll add to this that what we want to train
[01:40:28] is we want to train for chaos. We want to train from mayhem. We want to train for the enemy to do
[01:40:32] things. We're not expecting. That's the way we want to train for. Because when you train for things
[01:40:35] that the enemy is not expecting the enemy do, you actually get good at reacting to it. You know,
[01:40:41] you can get good at scrambling. Yeah. Injutsu. Yeah. You can get good at ending up in positions that are
[01:40:49] beneficial. If you know, conscious thought. But because you've scrambled enough that now you just
[01:40:54] know what you're looking for. These little things are going to happen. I'm going to get the underhook.
[01:40:57] I'm going to get my hips in the right spot. I'm going to move my head over here. That's what we want to
[01:41:01] do. Yeah. Like the almost cliche saying to get comfortable being uncomfortable. So kind of thing,
[01:41:09] you know, it's like, yeah, you train yourself to be uncomfortable or to be trained in being uncomfortable.
[01:41:14] You can just deal better. But I'm trying to get something. I'm trying to reach a different point here.
[01:41:18] My point is this. If I let's say, let's say, here's, there's a through Z situations I can put you
[01:41:30] in. And they're all different. If I train you for A and B all the time, when I throw
[01:41:36] F at you, you're lost. If I throw Q at you, you're lost. If I train you, so I get you good at A and B.
[01:41:48] But then I start training you at DS or thrown you at F. I start throwing you at M. You will start to
[01:41:54] realize that even in these disparate scenarios, there are some commonalities. And there are some
[01:42:02] base positions that you can go to that will allow you the time to assess and make decisions.
[01:42:09] All right. So you can, you can get good at chaos. That's what I'm saying. You can get good at chaos.
[01:42:21] You can get good at it. You can say, oh, when I see things happening that I don't understand,
[01:42:27] here's what I need to do. I need to find a good covered position, hopefully elevated where I can
[01:42:33] look around. I need to figure out where my troops are. I need to do it very quickly. I need to
[01:42:40] identify a prominent terrain feature that I can move all of us to in a rapid manner so that I can
[01:42:48] get controlled situation right there. Now with those things that I just said, hey, I'm going to
[01:42:54] get into position where I can look around. I'm going to try and figure out where my people are.
[01:42:58] I'm going to look for a prominent terrain feature that I can utilize as a stronghold. Guess what I just
[01:43:03] solved for just about any scenario that unfolds that I don't understand. I have a plan. I have a plan
[01:43:10] that I can actually implement against any situation. Think about that. So, oh, if I get a contact
[01:43:18] front, I have a plan. Oh, we start getting a shot up from the front and we're in an open ground
[01:43:24] I have a plan. It's a standard operating procedure. Oh, I start getting shot up from the front and
[01:43:30] we're in close terrain. I have a plan. There's a specific immediate action drill we're going to
[01:43:35] perform. Oh, wait a second. I'm getting shot at. I'm not sure where it is. I hear screaming. I know
[01:43:42] that we're getting hit from multiple locations. What do I need to do? I have an immediate action for
[01:43:47] that too. I'm going to find cover. I'm going to look around. I'm going to try and figure out where
[01:43:51] my troops are and I'm going to look for a prominent terrain feature that we can move towards.
[01:43:56] Yeah. There. Now the sun, the chaos isn't really chaos. Right. Now the sun, I have a plan.
[01:44:03] Yeah, it's a kind of a kind of chaos. And I can actually apply that plan to almost any scenario.
[01:44:09] So, the more that you train people for things that they don't expect and don't understand,
[01:44:14] the better they will get it dealing with those things. Yeah. And that's very positive. Yeah.
[01:44:22] Moving on. Further, all plans must be communicated and rehearsed at each level of command
[01:44:32] from the fire team to the company and above. It sounds like these guys did not have good decentralized
[01:44:38] command in terms of actually knowing what the overall plan was because it sounds like the fire teams were
[01:44:43] there, even the putty and the fire team levels were a little bit lost at points. In particular,
[01:44:49] putty and commanders, putty and sergeants and squad leaders and fire team leaders must be aware
[01:44:53] of each man's assignment. This should include who goes into a structure first, who covers.
[01:44:59] Cover move. Nowadays, because we've done in the US military, we've done so much urban combat
[01:45:07] in the last, what has it been 17 years? Every military unit in the US military, they
[01:45:16] can take down a structure and they do it well. And they do it off of standard operating procedures,
[01:45:22] not off of a specific plan of who goes where. Continue on hand in arm signals as well as
[01:45:29] vote commands should be established and practiced. And the last section is called command and
[01:45:39] control. In full-scale urban conflict, especially in situations where enemy dispositions are not
[01:45:47] well known, initial contact with the enemy can be a unexpected b at very close range and see
[01:45:54] massively devastating. Command and control, the basic Marines connection to his leadership can
[01:46:01] disappear in the blink of an eye. During Operation Wacety, Charlie won five lost all of its officers
[01:46:09] except for two. Sergeant's became platoon commanders, PFCs were squad leaders.
[01:46:17] In urban combat, it would not be at all surprising to find PFCs as platoon commanders, given the
[01:46:22] potentially high casualty rates. The critical factor for unit survival in these situations is that
[01:46:28] units ability to immediately determine the enemy's position and to return a high volume of sustained
[01:46:35] fire on those positions, allowing maneuverability despite the situation with the chain of command.
[01:46:42] Two, critical things there. Covenant move is one and decentralized command is two.
[01:46:47] That's what they're talking about. You need to be able to put down high, heavy volume of sustained
[01:46:54] fire on positions so that you can maneuver. And at the same time, you need to be able to do that
[01:46:59] regardless of the situation with the chain of command, decentralized command. During the first day
[01:47:08] of one-fives involvement in Operation Wacety, Alpha Company lost its CO, its Exo, and much of the company
[01:47:16] CP Group. Of necessity, Alpha was pulled back to the battalion rear-freer reorganization.
[01:47:22] We'll also have a few leaders effectively eliminated an entire company. This also delayed the
[01:47:28] battalion's attack, blunting our initiatives. You gotta have a plan if people go down,
[01:47:35] who's taken over. That's gotta be, that's gotta be ready.
[01:47:38] The individual marine who is under heavy enemy fire from very close range, who may now be
[01:47:48] cut off from his team and or squad leader needs to have been thoroughly informed of communications
[01:47:53] codes, lines of departures, lines of stoppage, friendly unit dispositions, and the ability to
[01:47:58] call and supporting fires in conduct, contingency plans. What does that mean? That means the
[01:48:04] troops need to understand what is happening. In short, in urban conflict situations, command and
[01:48:13] control needs to be understood at every level down to the basic marine. Based on our experiences
[01:48:21] during Operation Wacety, expect the unexpected, expect chaos and plan for all possibilities,
[01:48:30] and it signed Scott Nelson 1st Lieutenant Commanding Officer Charlie 1-5, Nick War 2nd Lieutenant

[01:48:50] Charlie 1-5, Nick War 2nd Lieutenant Commanding Officer Charlie 1-5, Nick War 2nd Lieutenant Commanding Officer
[01:49:00] Police Stoke to be born with that. This document, which is now
[01:49:20] well it's 50 years old, 1968, and there's still less as learned in this that applied to
[01:49:32] really apply to everything. Apply to life, apply to urban combat, apply to business,
[01:49:38] apply to leadership. So, there you have it, and of course, when we see the way,
[01:49:46] broadly, we can recognize it more, we can see it in more things, and it makes us more effective
[01:49:55] leaders regardless of the battlefield that we're on. So, read, and appreciate the lessons of the past,
[01:50:04] and echo, speaking of the way. I know, I know, due to it's sort of beneficial, sort of helpful
[01:50:16] in allowing us to understand the way more clearly and perhaps even more broadly. I don't know
[01:50:22] if you have any recommendations of how we can sort of get in the game. Yeah, and staying in the game.
[01:50:27] Yeah, it's fun. You mentioned G2 is like a way to recognize things. Like it's so,
[01:50:36] it's such a metaphor, even teaser word metaphor seems like it's like detail. It's like it is life
[01:50:42] in so many ways. Like all even this thing that I'm listening to. Yeah. Read. I'm like, oh yeah,
[01:50:47] I do just, every single one, I just don't want to bore everyone with okay, more G2 stuff.
[01:50:52] Like I said, great to set up that on the judo podcast that we did. I was talking about the fact
[01:50:57] that I have to give credit some credit to G2 for sort of revealing to me the thread that
[01:51:06] tied all these things together as JP was in town. Sure. And we were rolling G2 yesterday. And I was
[01:51:13] thinking as like, actually when we were done, I was thinking, man, when we were in Ramadi
[01:51:20] 12 years ago, I was a black belt in G2. Like it was beneficial for me then to a
[01:51:29] been a black belt in G2, not because I wasn't going out and grappling against the enemy.
[01:51:35] But I had already started to connect some of these dots. And it's very, very helpful in life.
[01:51:44] Yeah. It's also helpful because it is a physical representation that you can feel and you can see.
[01:51:59] It's not a theory. Yeah. There's theory behind it. But it's not a theory. It's happening to you.
[01:52:05] And therefore when it happens to you, you have something physical, something concrete,
[01:52:08] something that you actually experienced on a physical level. And if you, and that allows you to
[01:52:14] understand it metaphorically better. Yeah. Like when you get caught when someone's trying to choke
[01:52:24] you and then pull them down and walk you and you just got flanked. That just happened to you.
[01:52:28] It's not metaphorical. You truly understand what it feels like to get flanked. If I explain to you,
[01:52:37] hey, when I'm telling you this thing over here and then I come out you from another angle,
[01:52:40] you understand it. You're just starting to grasp the concept. But it didn't happen to you.
[01:52:48] But when I'm trying to choke you and you go for the defense and then boom, you get our
[01:52:52] mocked and you didn't see it coming at all, you feel a flank, you feel the effectiveness of
[01:52:58] it in real time. In real time. Yeah. And that's why it's very beneficial to train some of that
[01:53:05] you too. Oh yeah. Feel experience. Yeah. The laws of combat. Mm-hmm. Feel them. Yeah.
[01:53:13] You'll have a better comprehension of them. Yeah. And that sounds like a profound level to like that's
[01:53:20] like a that's good if you can keep that in mind. And then you can go on the other side of the
[01:53:26] spectrum where it's like, see you just fighting with your friends with no consequence. You know,
[01:53:32] where I think a lot of the time. What does that mean? Like if mean if you go, hey, let's go
[01:53:37] train right now. What we're going to do when you say let's go train, sure we might go over some
[01:53:41] oh, oh, we're fighting but without real consequences. We don't lose friendship, we don't get injured,
[01:53:46] we don't get you know, wrestle that stuff. But we get to like fight, you know, I don't that's also good.
[01:53:53] Yeah. So in here's the thing like there's other thing like some people in I think we most people
[01:54:00] like we like fighting but we don't want to like fight people. Like I don't want to fight everyone,
[01:54:08] you know? Well because then you can get arrested. Well, sir most people like I said,
[01:54:15] we don't want to just fight you know because there's all kinds of different reasons or whatever.
[01:54:19] But when you can just when you have the opportunity to to fight someone with no consequence,
[01:54:26] just to see how it would go. You know like if you you know these huge, huge men, you know
[01:54:32] guys who are like seven feet tall four and you're probably just huge and strong men and stuff like that.
[01:54:37] You don't want to necessarily fight them but you're like, I wonder how that would be like
[01:54:41] roll with to fight with that guy. You know, when you do your Jitsu you get that. You get that opportunity
[01:54:47] straight up. You want to try to fight this. I wonder how many people out there wondering,
[01:54:51] I want to be a fight juggle. I just say I would beat them up not to say I wouldn't, but I
[01:54:55] wonder how it would be that it's a lot of people show up at the gym and that's exactly why.
[01:55:01] That's the point. If anything is it doesn't matter if their white belts are black belts.
[01:55:05] Yeah, they still like, they can't ever want to see how that experiences you know.
[01:55:10] They usually smile. Yeah, fully and really when it comes down to it, I mean unless you're
[01:55:15] trying to hurt someone you know and there's a bunch of different ways to hurt someone if you want
[01:55:18] to hurt them because you don't like them or you think they should you know they deserve it or all this
[01:55:22] stuff. It's not about that. It can be about that for sure, but that's not ultimately what it is.
[01:55:27] It's more about like I wonder I wonder how it beat a fight that person. And then when you start to
[01:55:34] learn more and more and more you just you really just enjoy that activity like quite get to fight. Like
[01:55:39] right now if I wanted to, if you had the time or whatever, mean you we could go we could go fight
[01:55:43] right now. Yeah. And it'd be like in a good safe way. You know, it's wrapped this up then.
[01:55:48] That's the way to do it. Anyway, okay. All right, back to the path. That's the path in
[01:55:57] appropriate part of the path by the way. Yeah. You wouldn't be you without you, just I would
[01:56:02] not be. You wouldn't even be like happy, especially if you knew I wouldn't be happy at all.
[01:56:08] Yeah, especially if I knew, but on top of that I wouldn't have connected things that I
[01:56:18] that you did so connected for me. Yeah, there's something else. I would not be who I am.
[01:56:28] I'm going to straight up say. Yes. I would not be who I am without you, just you. Yeah. And you
[01:56:33] wouldn't be who you would not be on this podcast without your tips. No. I couldn't even talk to you.
[01:56:38] I mean, believe me, it's a stretch anyway. It's a stretch anyway. But without your tips,
[01:56:43] you'll have to at least do something, right? Without that, if you talk about TV shows,
[01:56:47] I'd be like, well, yeah, I'd be like muting your microphone or something. Yeah, I mean, see,
[01:56:52] so did you? Hey, it's a life-saver. So you're insane. Yeah. You get you into all kind of different things.
[01:56:56] But yeah, you know, and even if you're trying to like, it's staying the path. Okay. I'm dragging it.
[01:57:03] I dig it, man. But it's important. When you're when you're trying to get on the path, stay on the path.
[01:57:08] Be, be on the path. It's only fitting. For real. It's only fitting. Okay. Let's say,
[01:57:14] okay, let's say you have weapons training. Sweet. Let's say you can drive a car really well.
[01:57:21] Cool. You can hunt. You can you're capable. You can, you know, all this stuff, right? But
[01:57:29] if you're stripped away of like your tools, oh, then what? You know, man on man. Yeah, just
[01:57:36] if you don't have the jujitsu. And this is, yeah, and this is more of just a real general, like,
[01:57:40] way to look at it. So it's like, you ever watch men in black? Yeah, I can't really remember to watch about it.
[01:57:48] This might not even be the movie, but it's a movie with one of the, it's like this big,
[01:57:53] rope creature, right? And then they find out it's just a suit and in the inside, there's just this
[01:57:57] little worm type person thing, you know, that kind of, you know. Oh, seriously, if I didn't
[01:58:03] knew jujitsu, I would just be like a little worm. Yeah, you would. Yeah, big. You know, strong
[01:58:09] guy or whatever. But then like, if all your tools were taken away, what do you left with kind of
[01:58:14] thing? Isn't it weird when you meet people that are that? Like, they're like big, yeah, maybe
[01:58:21] even they're strong, maybe even they are aggressive. Yeah. But they don't have, they don't have a skill.
[01:58:27] They don't have the skill. Right. That's kind of a bummer. That's essentially,
[01:58:30] now here's this, here's the situation that people might be listening and think, okay, well,
[01:58:34] let's say you're in the situation when you don't have the skill. You have two options.
[01:58:38] Option one is the easy path, which is I'm just never going to get that skill. I'm never going
[01:58:45] to go near jujitsu. I'm never going to get in a confrontation with anybody because I don't want
[01:58:48] to be proven to myself that I'm a worm inside of a suit. Or you can take the hard path, which is
[01:58:58] even though I'm 37 years old, I'm bummed that I missed out on the, you know, I took me a while,
[01:59:08] but you know what, I'm going to go figure this out. I'm going to go at least learn some of it.
[01:59:12] I'm going to at least learn some of it. I would take that. Oh, yeah. Even though I know it's hard,
[01:59:18] because people, you know, when you're, when you get older, you don't want to try something new.
[01:59:22] Right. Even though it's proven that learning something new is completely beneficial for your
[01:59:29] mental and physical health. Yeah. Yeah. And I, yeah, it's not all like pleasurable roses and stuff.
[01:59:40] Oh, no. There's some, there's some struggle in there. But tell me about it. There's, there's,
[01:59:46] there I had a minister. I was, I was in turtle position. Dean Lister is the shoulders healing
[01:59:52] back up. I was in turtle position mount and side control for 22 minutes the other day. And that's a
[01:59:59] struggle. And also he was pushing my face into the mat and saying what color is the mat.
[02:00:08] See, like, you see what I'm saying? Well, was that fun? The answer is no. No, that's high level struggle.
[02:00:14] Yeah. Because the typical person you're going to do, that's not going to happen to you. So that's,
[02:00:18] that's like the struggle. That's the last one. That's going to get some of that has a personal
[02:00:23] vendetta on your existence. Yeah. Dean has on mind. Yeah. I think it's a CD called Kill Jocko does indeed.
[02:00:30] Yeah. Factually nonetheless. All right. There's going to be some struggle in there. You get a
[02:00:33] but you jump in there. Just like everything when you learn golf, there's going to be a struggle. No.
[02:00:38] You're going to miss that whole sometimes. Right. No. Thanks for coming struggle. Yeah. But on a
[02:00:43] professional and fundamental level, it's all the same struggle right here. And then last, you're going to
[02:00:48] need to get you. And when you get your gear, you're going to go to originmate.com, get an origin
[02:00:52] gear. It's the best kind of made in America from the cotton grown in America, loomed or weave woven
[02:00:59] woven in America, assembled, sewn stitched, presented, enjoyed, utilized, utilized in America.
[02:01:09] I actually can be utilized wherever, but nonetheless, I mean in America, and they are factually
[02:01:13] no, not my opinion sounds like an opinion, but it's factually they're factually the best firm in the world.
[02:01:19] Yeah. What's cool is the guise are awesome, but there's a problem.
[02:01:27] What's the problem? The problem is you can't wear a ghee to the store.
[02:01:32] No. No. You can't wear a ghee to the restaurant. No, no, you're in it.
[02:01:36] And yet you wear the origin pants and you think, man, I wouldn't mind, you know, they had a pocket.
[02:01:41] I would roll out, right? Yeah. Especially if you get the black ones. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:44] You know, it's not, it's not crazy to think, hey, maybe I'll just kind of roll out to the store
[02:01:50] or maybe go take my wife out for dinner. No. Yeah. But that's okay. Because guess what we got now.
[02:01:58] Denom, origin jeans, dig it. Yeah. So those are common. Yeah, that's not quite out yet, but I got mine.
[02:02:05] Yeah, I don't have mine and you know it. I'm just texting Pete, right? I don't want to buy an
[02:02:11] ain't on pizza. He's busy, man. He does a lot. And I don't want to, I don't want to,
[02:02:15] my personal interest start to create roadblock or speed bumps in this whole thing.
[02:02:20] Don't. But I do want those jeans though. That's the thing. So I got a balance.
[02:02:24] It's the little dichotomy. My personal interest and the interest of Pete in his discourse.
[02:02:30] Unless I will have them, we will have them when do they come out then? Jocker in the process of coming out right now.
[02:02:36] Yeah. Yeah. The material. We are cutting the material. Now we're so in the material.
[02:02:42] Yeah, it's interesting because I don't really get excited about jeans or I don't get it like new jeans coming out.
[02:02:48] Or new iPhone car. I don't get excited about that kind of stuff, but for some reason I'm kind of excited about what I'm going to tell you
[02:02:54] why I'm a little bit excited about it. Because of this, jeans are American. Right? Jeans represent America.
[02:03:03] Let's face it. If you wanted to draw a stereotypical American human, they'd be wearing a pair of jeans.
[02:03:09] Yeah. Here's the problem. Jeans were made in America. Jeans were invented in America. Jeans became
[02:03:15] famous in America. And then we sold our soul and put them overseas. Let them get manufactured overseas.
[02:03:23] Something that shouldn't have happened. And so to bring it back to America, does that feel good? Indeed. Yes it does.
[02:03:31] Yeah, man. Makes sense. I dig it. So yeah. That's the soul. Other clothes or teachers and stuff
[02:03:39] more, and if you can get even if you don't want jeans, you can get joggers right now.
[02:03:44] Yeah, man. If you can't get me a great company. Supplements to Joint Warfare,
[02:03:48] Curoloyal Discipline, Discipline Go. Discipline Go. So when I work, sometimes I have to work for
[02:03:57] two three straight hours without any interruptions. Yeah. Yeah. You see what I'm saying.
[02:04:05] So I would be drinking discipline and all of a sudden I'm an hour and 40 minutes in and guess what?
[02:04:09] I got to hit the head. That's not a risk for you. So that's why we made Discipline Go.
[02:04:13] Discipline Go is just a pill. So it's called a capsule. Capsule. And it's got the, uh, it's got the
[02:04:20] goodness in it. And we also have coming the Discipline Go in a can. Yeah. Yeah, that's like a,
[02:04:27] if you had it yet. Yes. And that's, that's where you have the one where, like where was that?
[02:04:32] Did you, that gave you one in New York when we were in the New York. Yeah, I had one before that though.
[02:04:36] That's a couple. They sent me some. Yes. Good. I got more coming today.
[02:04:40] Hopefully it'll be here. But, um, yeah. So that'll be coming. Of course we got milk.
[02:04:48] Which apparently Dr. Luke hates mint chocolate chip passionately. Yeah. And it's a herd. I'm going off the
[02:04:54] other day. Like, why would you want anything that tastes like toothpaste? Mint just toothpaste. Yeah.
[02:04:59] So we have a little disagreement. We'll have to settle on on the map. But he's just going with
[02:05:02] peanut butter vanilla girl or something. And that's good. And don't forget about the warrior kid
[02:05:08] milk. No kidding. Yeah. It tastes like strawberry. Nestle's strawberry quick. That's what it tastes like.
[02:05:16] Yeah. Can I say that? Is that legal? Yes. Okay. Whether it's legal or not. I can say it. I did
[02:05:21] say it. And it's tastes exactly like, and I'm using that. Exactly like strawberry Nestle's quick.
[02:05:28] But it has no sugar. It's got awesome protein. And it will make your kid into the next
[02:05:35] year. But this is something illegal right now. The next square away after. No, there you go.
[02:05:44] Smart. Yes. That's what the name names. You can do it. But so that's a word of
[02:05:50] main. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good. Yeah. That's a good. All my people, all my people up at
[02:05:54] origin that are working. Every day, someone, cotton, stitching, moving, shipping and making pretty much
[02:06:02] getting after it. Yeah. Big time. Also, we have a store called Jocco store. You know, stuff,
[02:06:08] a little bit more formulated for representing the path itself. You know, a little bit skewed.
[02:06:13] But some good stuff on there. Some new stuff on there too. By the way. Oh, really? Yeah. They,
[02:06:18] the trailer travel mug. Okay. Kind of new. Good. I'm putting a hoodie up there. The black
[02:06:24] on black. Hmm. I like that. It's subtle. Heavy. Okay. Oh, heavy. Yes. Is it legit heavy? Legit heavy.
[02:06:32] Legit like it's the head. Is it a heavy? Yes. Heavy is one. An existence. I'm sorry to say no. But
[02:06:37] there has one that you've ever made. Yes. Okay. It's it's. I want to do this to be heavier to
[02:06:43] run the original. Yeah. It's black on black. All right. You got it. Two of them. No,
[02:06:48] less good stuff on their rash cards on there too. For you, Jitsu. For you, Jitsu. Representing the path
[02:06:53] big time on now and also you can do other stuff with rash cards as well. But, um, yeah. Some good stuff
[02:07:00] on there. If you want to represent support, stand the path. That's where you go jockels door.com. Here's
[02:07:07] the thing about getting new stuff to and this is this is where this is where six year old echo
[02:07:12] brain comes out. Yeah. And there's a straight up. But it's still a place. It's still a pilot. If
[02:07:16] this dawns on me from time to time, especially when it hits me, when you get like a new
[02:07:21] thing, right? I've talked about this for when you get a new rash. You are six years old.
[02:07:24] Brow. You don't even act. You laugh. You know what I think? I think you think the same thing.
[02:07:28] I think you feel the same way. You won't necessarily admit it, especially not to me. But I think
[02:07:33] I think you feel the same way. Okay. If you got a new thing, you think of something that that
[02:07:38] excites me to get new. Oh, you keep doing what you're doing. I'll think of something over here.
[02:07:43] We'll think surfboard, think whatever. And then less there you go. So if you get a new rash card, a new
[02:07:48] ghee, even new socks sometimes. New shoe. I've gotten new socks. It's like 1843. I got
[02:07:57] guy. I get the socks from on it. I get fired up. Nonetheless, you get something new. Get a rash
[02:08:01] card. This is good after it. If you don't have one already, you will be looking for a
[02:08:06] going to do you do that much more. And that's the good thing about like these things that
[02:08:11] it never excites. It's 100% correct. Try it. Actually, I would say for anyone who has like,
[02:08:21] you know, sure to whatever they felt it. Oh, that's what I, that's how I predict. No, I, I, I
[02:08:26] understand what you're saying. And it actually is true when people, when you get that, you know,
[02:08:33] that's the classic, the classic scene from literature. Sure. Where is the, I think it's like the
[02:08:41] dawning of the uniform of the warrior. Yeah. And they do in movies too, the collage. They know
[02:08:46] the heroes put in his put on and then he's put his web gear on. And even just when people see,
[02:08:52] you know, the superheroes secret thing opens up and all this gears. Oh, yeah.
[02:08:57] Tell us all fire. Yes. Like the, the old that that's going to that chest in his or like in,
[02:09:06] in Mike in the dragons, you know when he's open opening up the chest and filled with war gear.
[02:09:11] Yeah. You know, I ruined that little fire. That's why I understand. Exactly. There we go.
[02:09:17] Same deal. Anyway, jockelstore.com. You want to represent on the path. Get fired up about
[02:09:23] stuff. There you go. See something like grab something. Also, jockel wake tea. We're still doing that.
[02:09:32] I'm still doing that big time because I was never a tea person. I mean, I'm saying that's that's
[02:09:36] saying something because I was never a tea person. But guess what? Look at me, tea person. Oh,
[02:09:41] kind of I only drink this tea, but you know, I'm into it. You're a jockel white tea person.
[02:09:45] A big time. How's that deadlift? Huge. 800 pounds actually. You know, I've been sticking
[02:09:51] with it. Hey, subscribe to the podcast if you haven't iTunes Google Play Stitcher,
[02:09:56] it'll leave reviews so I can read them. Yeah, if you want, if you don't want, then don't
[02:10:01] what? Also, where are you, kid podcast? Subscribe to that. I was on a podcast yesterday and they asked
[02:10:08] me to say subscribe to their podcast. Yeah. And I said, I don't even ask people to subscribe to my podcast.
[02:10:14] And I was like, well, actually, I got to say you know, and now I just did. Yeah. Maybe it's,
[02:10:19] you know, yeah, I actually, you and I had this discussion many times. I was like, why do we need to
[02:10:23] do you? You're like, well, people need to subscribe. Maybe they haven't subscribed. I mean, we're
[02:10:27] 162 podcasts deep. That's got to be four, 500 hours of listening. You don't think someone hit
[02:10:35] subscribe yet. Well, I agree with you, Philly. So, we can we cut this out now? We, yeah, you wrote this
[02:10:41] by the way. But yeah, of course we can. Well, this is a carryover. Yeah, carryover. Oh, yeah,
[02:10:49] look, it's us doing what we talked about before earlier today about doing things like,
[02:10:55] because that's just how, you know, we got to think. Got to think. Why do we want to waste
[02:11:00] five seconds of someone's time telling him? You know, it just sounds kind of like, what is it? Like,
[02:11:05] what? Like, what? Like, what? It's redundant. There's nothing. It's kind of like, um, you think
[02:11:08] everyone, do you think anyone ever got to this point three hours deep into the podcast and you were
[02:11:14] I said and subscribe and they reach down to their like, they're just all my stuff. Yeah, oh, shoot.
[02:11:20] I can do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[02:11:23] let me tell you what you might forget. You might forget to subscribe with a warrior,
[02:11:26] kid podcast because it's not coming out quite as consistently at this time. But it is
[02:11:32] a great podcast for you or for your kids to listen to to get them on the path. Yeah.
[02:11:38] They can also, if you have kids, that's a good one. Oh, if you have kids, it's definitely a good one.
[02:11:42] If you don't have kids, it's not a bad one. Yeah, you can learn some real fundamental.
[02:11:47] Those are lessons that you kind of forget to, you know, that's what I think.
[02:11:53] Also, you get to warrior, kid, self, Irish Oaks Ranch.com. Got young, aid, and warrior, kid.
[02:12:00] Making soap. Yeah, interesting. Having his own business. Yeah, throw them some support.
[02:12:06] Whatever, Irish Oaks Ranch.com. Real soap, too. By the way, yeah, this like,
[02:12:11] ooh, let me buy the soap. Kit online and put my flavor in there and sell it. You can do that.
[02:12:18] Oh, I didn't know you could do that. How that do you even know that? I, you know,
[02:12:21] yeah, I know, I've got to get into warrior knowledge.
[02:12:25] But the less, alright, don't forget about YouTube. And that's where you can see Echo's legit videos.
[02:12:31] And when you get to watch the video, make sure you get to the right.
[02:12:36] Nonetheless, we do have a YouTube channel. That's the point. That is the point. Because, you know, if you like the
[02:12:40] video version or you didn't know there was a video version, you can leave comments there, too.
[02:12:44] Yeah. I read them. I read YouTube comments. Even though Joe Rogan tells me not to.
[02:12:50] Yeah, because you do, that's a slippery slope because if a comment comes and it like,
[02:12:54] it's like, what's the worst can comment is the kind that's true or kind of true that like,
[02:13:01] just like, are you saying like, it won't, it's not a hard time. It's a indirect fire. It's an indirect
[02:13:06] fire, but more effective like, you know, in your neck or something. You know, it's like, that kind of,
[02:13:10] it has to be a little bit true. I actually, I think I've told you this before, but I was one night,
[02:13:15] I was reading YouTube comments to my oldest dog or about me. Because they were, and I forget it was,
[02:13:22] it wasn't our podcast. It was, it was a different podcast to podcasts that maybe people weren't as
[02:13:27] much on board with the programs. They had a lot of really colorful things to see. So, I think just
[02:13:34] Joe Rogan saying to you, like, don't read them and this is why he doesn't say that. He just,
[02:13:39] he doesn't say like, hey, hey, John, don't know. He's like, oh, you can't read the YouTube comments.
[02:13:44] Right. He'll say it like that. Yes, and that's what I mean. So, you're just knowing that allows you to
[02:13:48] go in and, and know, like, okay, you can read them and you just got to know that that's a successful,
[02:13:52] but it's pretty much now when Jordan Peterson, like, says he reads it, but like, they impact him.
[02:13:57] Yes, he just didn't know. He didn't. No, Joe Rogan needs to tell him that you got to tell him,
[02:14:02] hey, that's like that's got a normal comment section as well. I'm saying it's not like on Instagram
[02:14:06] where it's like, hey, you know, it's like, it's just different. The dynamic, bro, are you to make these
[02:14:11] videos? You know this, but are you to make these videos like a, you know, parodies of like Darth Vader
[02:14:15] goes on dates and then I made this one, of course. You put those on my channel on our channel,
[02:14:20] on our channel. People still watch. I mean, they're funny. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I'm in Jeff
[02:14:25] with, but I made this one, uh, bikini light saber battle. Yeah. It's like, you know, um, glory in them.
[02:14:32] They're just fighting with light sabers at the beach or whatever. And, well, you know, people
[02:14:37] watch them, but man, I look at the comments on that man. It's like, people, I think someone wanted
[02:14:42] me to die. He said whoever made this should die. Like literally said that. I was like,
[02:14:46] hey, what was they hating about it? What were they hating about? That it was dumb.
[02:14:50] Oh, okay. Which it is, by the way. Yeah, it's like two girls. They're mad at something.
[02:14:56] And they've got something dumb. Then they fight lightsaber and then like,
[02:15:00] she won the girl kills the other one and then like spider man comes out. Is basically all the
[02:15:05] props that I had at my house. It's like, let me make a video. Yeah. So it was like, you know, it was dumb
[02:15:10] for sure. But, bro, you don't have to say that. Concoments like, I got to die now because it's dumb.
[02:15:15] You know, the point of the point is, yeah, you got to kind of know that that's not a normal
[02:15:20] comments. Yeah. You too, there. But, you know, I get to get in a statement out of it. It's pretty fun.
[02:15:26] Also, you got psychological warfare that's on iTunes, Google Play and B3 platforms. And that is a
[02:15:32] album with tracks about how to overcome various stages of weakness that you might occur
[02:15:36] that might occur during your day. That's all we're going to say about that one. It's good. That's
[02:15:40] very concise. Yeah. It's jockel though, by the way, on the track. So that's something. Also, on it,
[02:15:46] on it.com slash jockel. This is where I get all my kettlebells and socks, like I mentioned. It seems
[02:15:52] odd like why we just get socks from on it because they're freaking dope. But you ever look at the
[02:15:56] socks on it. They're freaking good. Yeah. Really good. You want to flex on the water pattern.
[02:16:01] I got all of them. So weird flex, but okay. Yeah. No, when you want to flex at the with, uh,
[02:16:10] at the people at the TSA. I keep, I keep wanting to use the term flex like in its modern way.
[02:16:16] Because my kids use it. Yeah. And I keep wanting to use it. Yeah. Keep trying, man. Yeah. I think
[02:16:22] you're doing pretty good. But no, I haven't really appropriately used it yet. Well, you used weird
[02:16:27] flex, but okay. On to me, not about me. Like you're saying about someone else. No, but you're
[02:16:33] seeing too. No, because KT had a video that was called that. Oh, it's called weird flex,
[02:16:37] but okay. And that's when I realized it was a thing. That that that that's an actual thing.
[02:16:42] Yeah. Weird flex, but okay. No, you told me it was a thing. Yeah. It was like this. Yeah.
[02:16:47] I don't use it. I want to use it. But it's sort of humble brag, right?
[02:16:51] Like we're flex, almost. Yeah. It's like you're bringing about something kind of weird to brag
[02:16:55] about, but cool man. Dude, dude, dude. You did kind of thing. Oh, that's what the
[02:16:59] answer case this video was. Weird flex what okay was about he was in a, he's in a movie
[02:17:06] and he was kind of like flexing. He was in a movie. Yeah. And he was like, but okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:17:10] Yeah. Yeah. He was all fired up. Yeah. Be more like, hey, like, I can turn my eyelids inside
[02:17:16] out. Okay. We are flex. Okay. I think his flex was a little
[02:17:24] funny. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you see what I'm saying. That's the answer. Nonetheless, on it,
[02:17:29] this is where you get your fitness stuff. You know how we're, we all have home gyms. Most of us. Yeah.
[02:17:35] And you know, you want to dig you on somewhere kennel bells, you know, some jump ropes,
[02:17:38] battle ropes, like stuff, more good stuff to keep you on the path, keep you on shape. That's where
[02:17:43] you go on it dot. If you, if you want to hit your mind and shape, you're brain in shape,
[02:17:49] then you should read if you want to read some books that I wrote, then cool. You can read Mikey
[02:17:54] in the dragons. Best children's book ever for children under the age of six voted by me and you.
[02:18:02] Yeah. And our children and our children actually someone asked my daughter, my middle daughter,
[02:18:08] the other day, what's your favorite book of your dad's? And she said Mikey in the dragons.
[02:18:14] Interesting. Yeah. My daughter didn't, we didn't have any kind of official like,
[02:18:17] oh, what's the best one? But the one that she always reaches for pushes for is where the warrior
[02:18:23] kid to. Yeah. She likes marks mission. Yeah. So there's that. So there's Mikey in the dragons.
[02:18:27] There's way the warrior kid to marks mission. There's way the court warrior kid. One,
[02:18:33] we just call way the warrior kid. Soon to be way the warrior kid three writing is complete.
[02:18:39] John Bowzeck is knee deep in the art right now. And that will be coming out in the spring.
[02:18:45] I'm going to get it on Amazon for pre-order as early as I possibly can so we don't have another
[02:18:51] scenario like we had with Mikey in the dragons where we bought you all bought a lot of them.
[02:18:57] And I didn't have them on hand. Let's say, digging everybody, everybody by Christa. So
[02:19:03] look for that one way the warrior kid three will be coming out. And then of course we got
[02:19:07] discipline equals freedom field manual, which is awesome to see that impact people.
[02:19:13] And it's also a good gift to give to people that maybe need a little help. Yeah. Just kind of
[02:19:20] just stay in the direction extreme ownership and that I got to me a leadership. Those are the
[02:19:24] leadership books that I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin. And they will help you
[02:19:31] with your organization and in your business and in your life lead. And when also we got Ashland
[02:19:38] Front, which is my leadership consultancy. It's me. It's Lave Babin, JP D'Nell, Dave Burke,
[02:19:46] Flynn, Cochrane, Mike's Rally, Mike Bima. There's a picture that echoes into. He's randomly
[02:19:54] in the picture on the website. Yeah, but he's not one of the leadership instructors. He is one
[02:20:01] of the leadership instructor, Filmers. Right. Hey man, I'm on the website. So that's really all.
[02:20:10] So what we do is we solve problems through leadership. Go to Ashlandfront.com for that. We also have

[02:21:43] If you need that. And if you want to pass on lessons learned to us, we are kicking it on the
[02:21:53] interwebs on Twitter on Instagram and on Facebook. Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Jock
[02:22:01] Willink. And of course, thanks to all of our military personnel around the world who stand
[02:22:11] their ground to protect us. And also thank you to our police and law enforcement, the firefighters,
[02:22:20] the paramedics and EMTs, the correctional officers, the folks on board of patrol and all the
[02:22:26] first responders who stand their ground here at home to protect us. And everyone else, I always say
[02:22:37] that time is short. But most of us have more than six seconds. The six seconds that Corp.
[02:22:52] Jonathan Yale and Lance Corp. Jordan Hurger had to make the ultimate decision and the ultimate
[02:23:01] sacrifice they could have had more time. Had they run away. But they sacrificed it all.
[02:23:17] They gave up their time, but we still have time to time. They gave us.
[02:23:23] So don't waste it. Not six minutes of it, not six seconds of it, not one second of it,
[02:23:35] none of it. Get out there every second of every day. And get after it.
[02:23:42] Good. Good until next time. This is echo and jockel. Out.
