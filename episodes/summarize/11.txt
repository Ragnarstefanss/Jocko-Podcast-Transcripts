and he talks about being involved in a great conflict and a great struggle you know he had like the one we're involved and and it's I think that was very reflective of that this is this seeing that you know the enemy that we're fighting here this this type of G-hode you know this G-hodeism with this this strain of Islam that exports G-hode across the world and and once it goes out and terrorize and brutalize people like this is a great struggle this is going to be a generational struggle this is going to go on for a long time it's certainly transcends Iraq and I think he had he really seemed to sense that in a way that was pretty phenomenal in the movie is they they make him out to be this sad guy that's all serious and again they completely miss the mark just like they they portray Chris to be this ultra serious guy Mark was hilarious, grigarius, another guy that was joking all the time mostly at inappropriate times and had that you know he would just he would light up a room when he'd come in to a room because he was just on fire and to portray him as this guy that's all down in the dumps and depressed it was just it was horrible to see that it was it was just so opposite of the real mark I mean this is the brooding guy and and the head of miss this kind of like pencil neck kind of you know is the quote patent couldn't fight his way out of a piss soaked paper back I mean Mark was a badass guy he had massive arms he carried his his big heavy Mark 48 machine gun that weighs like 25 27 pounds fully loaded with all the gadgets on it it would no sling he cared his shoulder like it was a little him for rifle you know that weighs seven pounds I'm gonna air you know with all that's it's hey we just got dealt with an op everyone's tired everybody's exhausted drop your gear is what he tell everybody you know 10 minutes I want you in the mission planning space and we go through that post operation debrief just talking about what went right what went wrong will we learn from it what's the enemy doing now that we hadn't seen before how come we adapted that every single time there was no cut in the corners we did that every time we could do it and kind of a short concise concise form but he'd be happy we just got back from the op we just went out did some damage and then you could track Tony's like happiness factor it was inversely proportional is happiness factor was inversely proportional to the amount of time we spent in the camp so as at the longer we stayed in the camp he's like he's like getting angry I'm getting angry and if we had an op cancel which was pretty rare but ever once while we'd have a night where we didn't go out and he would just be angry I want to go out I want to go get some why are we in the camp and you know as we wrap up on Tony and Tony was definitely a force but just so everybody knows that this was a task unit of 40 plus guys and there was absolutely a core group in there and Charlie and Delta between of guys that were without question without any question whatsoever warriors that like I said held the line and told the line and went forward over and over again and and the rest of the guys maybe the guys that weren't quite in leadership positions but it was a very tough deployment casualties fire fights killed wounded and there was stress massive amounts of stress and there was combat fatigue and there was fear but all these guys overcame that fear to do their job so we could accomplish the mission that was put in front of us but of course my boss is wanted me to keep my guys safe and kill back guys and when the war of course they did it in an in businesses of course the boss wants you to be profitable and keep your troops happy but be profitable be ethical right that those are standard things and those are going to be aligned so if you send up an idea up the chain of commander you get told to do something and you don't do it because it's not going to help you be profitable why would your boss disagree with that it's not going to happen so you have to have the the wherewithal to actually know when to say no and on the moral and ethical things that Dave talked about those are clear cut those are clear cut if you're getting told to do something that's illegal or ill moral then it is your duty and responsibility to disobey that order and that's the way it is all right last question my team has missed our last two deadlines I want to take ownership but I'm not sure how it's not what you preach it's what you tolerate and look you have to you have to be effective we talk about there's two there's only two measures that really that matter and that's effective and ineffective are you effective or you accomplish in the mission and if you are figure out a way to become even more effective if you're ineffective you're not accomplish in the mission then you got to figure it out you got to take ownership of that you got to solve that problem so if your team is getting the job done you can't tolerate less than that you have as a leader you have to drive those standards I learned pretty early on that in the seal teams there's some strong personalities there which is awesome that's one of the great things about the seal teams and there's always this tension between people have there my we should do it this way we should do it this way we should train this heart we should focus here there and and that's also be have some incredibly talented great guys as we've just talked about but as a leader you have got to maintain the standards and there's some there are standards that just cannot be compromised you've got to push hard you've got to drive that performance you got to set the tone for that and if you don't do that no one's going to do it and you know if Chris were here today I think he'd tell you man is you know the the only reason he was able to do what he what he could was because there was a huge team of guys supporting and those the guys care and the machine guns in that were helping beat back attacks and guess what when you're attacked by machine guns and and rockets from RPGs and and you got a dozen enemy fighters maneuvering on you you're not breaking contact with a bolt action sample shot snagged you got to have those machine gunners that are going to beat back those attacks and that's what those guys did so you know without without without that whole team we we were carrying our own shoulder fire rock it's our leading peddaus or it was always a guy that would carry the carry that big heavy 84 millimeter recoil is rifle over shoulder this big bazooka looking thing and and the heavy rounds for that it was it was we had to have that kind of firepower with us so that was critical for all that we did but most of the shots were pretty close I mean you're talking urban combat is you know there wasn't a lot of real long range shooting ever once a while they I think I think Chris and Tony he had a couple guys from 1500 yards or so out in a rule there I went on that particular operation and you know where it's telling telling friend these where you are so you can get help you know directing help in where you need it you know and telling where the enemy is I mean all that stuff is absolutely critical I think as a as far as of favor it's specialty I like to shoot I like combat shooting combat rifle pistol shooting has always been one of my favorite things to do I love that about the seal teams you know training and combat rifle pistol shooting it you know moving and and hitting different targets and shooting against steel targets and we go to these amazing ranges and it's super fun and that being said that's not my job and that is that's a real realization you have to come to as a leader is that my job is not to shoot and I got to be able to shoot because there are times when I'm on the only guy can do that it's now what you preach it's what you tolerate and with that one thing I like to think about when when I hear about standards and what you're going to tolerate don't just think about your team you got to think about yourself you got to think about raising the bar on yourself you got to think about what you're going to tolerate from yourself and how you can raise that bar and raise that standard and get better with everything you do and thereby lead by example so that your team becomes the example and with that I think will close it out that was a long haul on the podcast I wanted to say thanks to everybody that's been tuning in and listening to the podcast it's been amazing getting all the feedback thanks obviously to my brother here Lave Babin for coming on I know he'll be on again if anybody out there wants to continue these conversations out there on the interwebs you connect with us on Twitter I'm at Jockel Willink Lave is at Lave Babin and of course as you know echo Charles is at echo Charles thanks for leaving reviews of the podcast and of the book on iTunes and Amazon that is very helpful to us so we know how we're doing and most of all for everyone that's out there in your little chunk of the world listening to our little chunk of the world thanks for getting out there and for getting after it and so until next time this is Jockel Lave and echo out so I think Chris or some like he's like hey jaco jaco turns around and bigels it's standing like one millimeter from his face given this like needle stared down and jaco just grabs him like you know grabs him like turns him around you know gets his back within like in like half a second and just throws a throw a rear naked choke on him and he had to go sleepy time and so we kind of had this I was spotting form looking through the camera we kind of got in situated kind of told him when it went to hold we kind of had like a ready fire terminology we came up with and one thing about Ryan is that dude could shoot and you know he he struggled at Nyland originally keeping up and you know with his physical fitness until he became bigdles 2000 then was born again hard but when we got to our shooting schools we realized what this guy could shoot he was a great shot and so when we were training with that that rifle we were on the range and we were practiced into going this elk hunt I'm talking a man on the target I realized right away like if we missed it's my fault because he's gonna be he's gonna write when I tell him to pull the trigger he's hitting that target and he's gonna it's gonna be right wherever that cross area I just I can remember that same land war for a chat of you were just talking about we're under fire we're in a very difficult situation there's a lot of chaos going on in this training environment here we are preparing for actual combat and of course they're trying to make that as realistic as possible and it's challenging as possible and we're getting shot at from like one of the target buildings and it's made out of like you know two by fours and and plywood the target building that's that's nearby Tony realizes that we got a self at target building now because we're taking fire from that building and he does a like full on sprit like wide open for about 50 yards and does human battering ram into the doorway one man clearance the building and like kills the role player who's shooting at us and it was like that's who's he's he's the total badass he's gonna handle the situation and that's the guy he was on the battlefield He was one of the three guys we had three guys that were on their third built-in and we called them the Triumvirate and these two other guys, she'll act of duty, I can't name them, they're outstanding guys but these guys have been together for three built-in three rotations through to the police, the middle east to Iraq and so we called them the Triumvirate you know which is the Triumvirate is a term from the Roman era where you had a group of three people who share a position of power to authority and these guys really drove they really they brought up the new guys, they trained new guys and got our opportunity really where they needed to be, we're kind of the heart and soul of the Baton and Chris was you know the real Chris that we knew and worked with was hilarious number one and you know that doesn't come across when you when you to a lot of people that he was a guy who's just funny is hell always could crack a joke sometimes when he shouldn't have been cracking the joke and I remember the first time that an IED I saw an IED going off about a block away for me and we were sitting on the rooftop and a sniper position as my first deployment before Jocelyn I were working together and all of a sudden there's a hundred foot fireball that goes up in the year I mean the blast wave hits me and just knocks me on my ass and frags just metal fragments and sure to concrete and stuff just raining down all over the place from from a block away you know from us and it was it was like damn that is that is not something I want to be standing on around interviewing when you hit that thing and when you see something like that like just the kinetic energy of a round coming in and just you know think of the biggest strongest guy you can imagine with a sledgehammer smashing a wall next to you and you know multiply that time seven or eight hundred rounds of man for a bell for a machine gun I mean we we hit guys from as close as I remember a couple of times were one time a particular me and markly and and Chris were sitting in a room and we look over and there's some guys like there's literally some moves like some enemy fighters with machine guns looking around the corner and they're like they're like 25 yards from this like like you know maybe 30 yards from this but that was that was difficult but Tony was just one of those guys that you know he was intimately evolved in the planning default aggressive I mean just incredibly aggressive we're gonna go in there and we're gonna hammer the enemy we're gonna go right in his backyard we're never gonna expect this and and we're gonna we're gonna win we're gonna crush them they're gonna kill bad guys and and one of the things that gained us momentum you know you talked about earlier Jockel of the the mortars that hit right outside the building you were sitting in and killed the soldier wounded several others we had IDs going often you were sitting in there and and the you were sitting in there and the you were going to brigade I went to I was actually I met the brigade commander once I think or maybe twice but one over watch position on this hill that's how we should do this and you looked at him and said that's awesome that's perfect let's get everyone over here and why don't you just go ahead and breathe them up and he looked at you and he said Nusser you tell him what to do it'll be better coming from you and so here was a guy that obviously because he'd been in the teams for 15 or 17 years obviously had more tactical experience than you did but he was so secure in his leadership and so secure in his tactical knowledge that it didn't mean anything to him and he realized that the best thing that he could do for the team and for your platoon was to let you lead this let you put out the word let you give the plan and I realized at that point and this was early in our work up that this guy was not just a tactician not just a tough badass frogman but he was a real leader and as I know you will say you are absolutely blessed to have Tony as your platoon chief I gotta say the seal team has produced some phenomenal phenomenal individuals some incredible battlefield leaders throughout the decades in the proud legacy and history of the seal teams and I can say with confidence that I believe that Tony for that he is probably one of the best combat leaders of seal teams has ever produced and I don't say that very lightly at all but he was a phenomenal phenomenal battlefield leader and you've heard of the break glass in case of war guys this is this is that guy and he was just his experience level was phenomenal I mean he had had at this point to put it respectly visible ten commander I'm on my second one but when we go into these these positions you know Chris would be he knew after the sun came up first call the prayer goes down and the kind of early dawn pre-done hours and then the sun comes up and the city comes alive and enemy fighters are moving around and you know he'd be on the on the weapon when he knew that was looking down his cypresscope when he knew it was it was that was the highest in the early morning you know as the morning comes around you know that 80 10 o'clock hour that's when we knew we were going to get contacted and you know late afternoon was kind of the same thing he'd be honest is gun and of course he had to rotate out at some point he could so you're only humanly possible this day when you're gun for so long you know I only have I only have eight or ten kilos and Chris you know how has he got 85 now you know some some you know so at some point through into our deployment before it was completed and you know the route as you can see some of those guys were you know we had seven other cypressine on both and they did a lot of great work and then you know so like you know six or eight seconds goes by he like comes back kind of slowly comes to gets up to a knee then stands up he's like kind of moves around like what happened and we're all kind of jaco's just acting like nothing happened to the other day and everyone is laughing hysterically and then we added big child we're going to go to big child hit the child we're done but BTF meant we're going to go in it's going to be hard it's going to be tough we better you know we're going to carry a lot of these roads were so dangerous we didn't drive this we would put patrol in for you know kilometers carry in heavy gear tons of water with us we had to bring all that stuff in and it was just it was tough it was difficult and we were going to be TF and we took pride in that you know BTF pretty much came became a way to overcome any obstacle of any kind mental physical environmental all yet to do just BTF and it's show can each other out you can always see our you could tell who our taskin it was because when you called a name of someone we would turn our heads return our entire shoulders at the same time because our next we're getting cranked up that's right because we had just battled Royale as you would encourage it but in particular you know Chris and we talked about Chris Kyle since the year was a phenomenal guy he had a great relationship with with with Ryan and really kind of took Ryan under his wing and and one of the things Chris like to do was instigate he was a huge instigator and and so they would they they talked Ryan into like hey bigdles come here you know some bigdles the new guys fired up like but we had to make a walkways we could actually like get it out and communicate with each other and I'm sitting there listening the radio and you know my command control position after the sun came up and Tony was a sniper looking through a loophole in the wall which is like a hole that was maybe six or eight inches on a diameter that we smashed out with a sledgehammer sometimes we used explosive charges but it gave you a little bit of cover so that you didn't get shot in the face by some enemy another enemy sniper across the street or some ice you would have a machine gun and so he's sitting there on a sniper rifle and I just hear this crack and it was just a round coming in and it missed his head by like two inches maybe I mean it came right in just you know whizzed past his face slam into the wall just behind him and I'm not getting mine that's the red flag that's the alert saying hey brother your ego is calling you need to put it in check you like life said you want to make your boss look good there's nothing you can do better to build trust with your boss than make him look good and give him all the credit he's going to let you run those handcuffs are going to get a little looser every time you do that never cared about who got credit are you kidding me are you kidding me we're going to put that ahead of accomplishing the mission that we're here to a call to we're here to do no the credit doesn't matter give the credit your boss deliver it to your boss on a platter on a silver platter bringing that credit and walk away from it and say I'm going to go get you some more and those cuffs are going to come off make it happen just next question what do you do where you know in order is bad and then as the Delta Potigimit, Jaco gave us this typical stare down I am Jaco I don't like people when I face when he meets us I'm going to intimidate you and look at you with Ferrod Brow and jutting out Jaco and I might have to fire you guys and I don't know two weeks through weeks we never know so the Delta Potigimit is now you know just you start a good buddy years and a great buddy of mine was was like who is this guy me Jockel was riding in in a Bradley fighting vehicle brave in the the some of the most dangerous roads in the world the time you know coming in with the the army battalion staff there and as our command and control and so we were already in we'd been there for I don't know three or four hours at that point maybe maybe longer and so we shot a couple guys and we're you know we're a couple enemy fighters and and we still had guys in security position certainly in guys on guns but at that point it was the I.D. Clarence team was like right underneath us and I know you were you were trying to move vehicles out of the way so we could get the tanks out there to our guys that were pinned down and needed help and those tankers came out every time the soldier for amazing you know when they when Chris Kyle got those two guys hot like how far away is that typically or is there even a little before right that's you have to do with people talking about these sniper elements well first of all they have to understand that it's in Ramadi in downtown Ramadi in 2006 this was this was like Stalin grad I mean it was just rubble pile buildings just we had this was alkydden Iraq battle space then so I was always very preferential to the radio man I thought it was the the most seribilly challenging job now that being said let me tell you what I wanted my platoon's to think I wanted my platoon's to think that each guy was the most important guy you know I wanted the the radio man to think that he was the most important I want the corner to think he was the most important because he was going to save everybody I wanted the snipers to think they were most important they were going to kill everybody I wanted the machine gunners to think they were the most important because they were going to lay down the fire and get us out but they were a critical critical part of the team and that it's not you know as we kind of back to what we were talking about with America Cypher earlier I mean I think Chris would be the first person to tell you that this is a team effort it is a huge team effort and so we could have done the Cypher's gonna do any of the stuff there doing without the machine gunners without guys carrying the rockets without the guys carrying the radio and all the heavy equipment that goes with that and you know the corpsman that's carrying his you know all of his equipment we couldn't have done any of that as seals without the support from the army and Marine Corps and would support those guys brought to us but if you were in the teams and you deployed overseas then that shouldn't be the highlight of your career shouldn't be the highlight of your knowledge it shouldn't be the highlight of your of your the the man test that people like to consider Buds not a man test means you didn't quit being cold good job it's and to that point I think it's you know for those folks it didn't really get tested and combat or didn't get a chance to go out on the battlefield and experience the just incredible physical nature of combat and how difficult it is then you know Buds is like everything so they talk about Buds all the time and so it's kind of this legendary thing and I'm looking down I'm like that's like 30 feet below me like directly below me right now so if this thing activates an ID that explodes like I'm gonna take it right to face probably I'd get up down and stop looking at what they're doing so we were just kind of hooked her down and when Jockel came in there it was it was fun because the the in particular the army operations officer for the battalion was a great guy and the battalion was awesome this was task force banded a bunch of tankers great guys we loved them they came in and I I led that for two years I instructed that course and I think we put on 130 something officers to that and the best officer we had some great officers that went through that and probably the best officer I put through was a prior-listed seal we had some officers that struggled and probably the they guy who struggled the most was another prior-listed seal most of these guys had been prior-listed a commission officer so it just goes to show you that you've every source whether it's a naval academy whether it's prior-listed and going to see an animal program whether it's coming in through OCS officer candidate school or or you know at universities you've got outstanding people that come out of those those commissioning sources you got some people that aren't that good that come out of those commission sources so it's about you and I remember a couple of times when I was like Jocco why don't you want to come on this up with us like go on this type of watch with us and you were like no I can't do that and even though I knew he wanted to do it he knew he had to you know whether it was approval plans for the other guys that were across the city or other elements that were out there doing those things that he understood what his role was and realized that if he was out there with me even though it had been fun he'd been getting gunned fights and and that was exactly where he wanted to be that he wouldn't be able to provide that support to some of the other guys and what they were doing
