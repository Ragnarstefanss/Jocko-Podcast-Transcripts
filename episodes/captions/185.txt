00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.12 This is Jocco podcast number 185.
00:00:04.12 --> 00:00:07.04 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willick.
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.04 Good evening, Yacco.
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:11.84 Good evening.
00:00:11.84 --> 00:00:19.68 You get one shot and that's it.
00:00:19.68 --> 00:00:26.36 And in the end, you're going into the ground.
00:00:26.36 --> 00:00:34.20 Regardless of what you believe the afterlife consists of or what it doesn't consist of.
00:00:34.20 --> 00:00:43.08 As far as what you get to hold on to, once you leave here is nothing.
00:00:43.08 --> 00:00:53.56 And I implore people all the time to make it count.
00:00:53.56 --> 00:00:56.84 Because this is it.
00:00:56.84 --> 00:01:02.000 This is the finals.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.56 There are no re-do's.
00:01:05.56 --> 00:01:15.64 You can't hit the rewind button and even worse, you can't even hit the pause button.
00:01:15.64 --> 00:01:21.60 There's no way you can stop the clock from ticking.
00:01:21.60 --> 00:01:22.60 No possible way.
00:01:22.60 --> 00:01:26.16 The countdown is on.
00:01:26.16 --> 00:01:31.88 And the days are finite.
00:01:31.88 --> 00:01:37.76 You only get so many.
00:01:37.76 --> 00:01:42.72 And then it's over.
00:01:42.72 --> 00:01:52.96 So until them make them count, make all of them count.
00:01:52.96 --> 00:01:59.48 And on the podcast that I have a guest, a fellow frogman whom to the best of my knowledge
00:01:59.48 --> 00:02:06.68 is doing his best to make his days count.
00:02:06.68 --> 00:02:10.36 His name is Mitch Aguior.
00:02:10.36 --> 00:02:12.88 We just met each other.
00:02:12.88 --> 00:02:14.60 But like I said, he's a frogman.
00:02:14.60 --> 00:02:16.28 He likes to get to.
00:02:16.28 --> 00:02:17.28 He likes to get after it.
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:21.28 So my guess is we should have some things to talk about.
00:02:21.28 --> 00:02:23.76 So Mitch, welcome to the podcast.
00:02:23.76 --> 00:02:25.16 Thanks for having me.

00:04:22.64 --> 00:04:28.64 And I was also into some sports that weren't at our school.
00:04:28.64 --> 00:04:32.64 I was on a arm wrestling team and a dodgeball team.
00:04:32.64 --> 00:04:34.64 A traveling dodgeball team.
00:04:34.64 --> 00:04:36.64 A traveling dodgeball team.
00:04:36.64 --> 00:04:40.64 It was by far my favorite.

00:04:44.64 --> 00:04:46.64 No, in like a season.

00:04:49.64 --> 00:04:52.64 Well, there's practice obviously.
00:04:52.64 --> 00:04:58.64 And if you take it serious like we did, we practiced like three times a week.

00:05:31.64 --> 00:05:32.64 You know, starters.
00:05:32.64 --> 00:05:34.64 And then you.

00:05:42.64 --> 00:05:49.64 I didn't do anything in high school that would be useful in my ongoing adventures.
00:05:49.64 --> 00:05:51.64 Well football basketball.

00:05:53.64 --> 00:05:54.64 Yeah.
00:05:54.64 --> 00:05:56.64 Just in general.
00:05:56.64 --> 00:06:01.64 I would say that competition mindset.
00:06:01.64 --> 00:06:02.64 You know.
00:06:02.64 --> 00:06:03.64 That.
00:06:03.64 --> 00:06:04.64 And just yeah.
00:06:04.64 --> 00:06:05.64 Being an athlete overall.
00:06:05.64 --> 00:06:10.64 That was always something that was just ingrained in me.
00:06:10.64 --> 00:06:12.64 You know, my both my mom and dad.
00:06:12.64 --> 00:06:14.64 They were really competitive.
00:06:14.64 --> 00:06:18.64 Like always had us in sports growing up my brother and I.
00:06:18.64 --> 00:06:19.64 And yeah.
00:06:19.64 --> 00:06:23.64 I always loved the competition side of things.
00:06:23.64 --> 00:06:27.64 And I actually like hate working out still to this day.
00:06:27.64 --> 00:06:29.64 Like I just don't really enjoy it.
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:37.64 But if there's some sort of competition involved in it or you know, competitiveness, that's what I really like.
00:06:37.64 --> 00:06:38.64 Sure.
00:06:38.64 --> 00:06:41.64 So you get done with high school.
00:06:41.64 --> 00:06:42.64 And you.
00:06:42.64 --> 00:06:44.64 What makes you join the Navy?
00:06:44.64 --> 00:06:47.64 Honestly, I was I was just bored.
00:06:47.64 --> 00:06:49.64 I was living in Ohio.
00:06:49.64 --> 00:06:51.64 And it sucked there.
00:06:51.64 --> 00:06:55.64 There was just nothing there that I wanted.
00:06:55.64 --> 00:06:58.64 How long after you graduated high school did you join the Navy?
00:06:58.64 --> 00:07:00.64 A couple months.
00:07:00.64 --> 00:07:04.64 Did you did you go in the dive fairer program to be in the team?
00:07:04.64 --> 00:07:06.64 Or did you just want to be in just in the Navy?
00:07:06.64 --> 00:07:07.64 No.
00:07:07.64 --> 00:07:08.64 I originally.
00:07:08.64 --> 00:07:09.64 I mean, it.
00:07:09.64 --> 00:07:11.64 It wasn't planned out at all.
00:07:11.64 --> 00:07:14.64 I was I was working three different jobs.
00:07:14.64 --> 00:07:16.64 I was a.
00:07:16.64 --> 00:07:17.64 A.
00:07:17.64 --> 00:07:20.64 A roofer, which I really, really loved.
00:07:20.64 --> 00:07:22.64 I was a great job.
00:07:22.64 --> 00:07:29.64 And I worked at my my parents like they owned a Delhi slash convenience store kind of thing.
00:07:29.64 --> 00:07:34.64 I worked there and I was a lifeguard at Calhary.
00:07:34.64 --> 00:07:36.64 And I and I was a surf instructor.
00:07:36.64 --> 00:07:38.64 You said Calhary, I already know.
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:41.64 It's an it's the world's largest indoor water park.
00:07:41.64 --> 00:07:42.64 Okay.
00:07:42.64 --> 00:07:43.64 And they have waves there.
00:07:43.64 --> 00:07:44.64 Yeah.
00:07:44.64 --> 00:07:47.64 I have a flow rider like a couple flow rider machines.
00:07:47.64 --> 00:07:49.64 Oh, the thing that she's wanted us to plastic.
00:07:49.64 --> 00:07:50.64 I was like, I'm not a type thing.
00:07:50.64 --> 00:07:52.64 Yeah, it creates an artificial wave.
00:07:52.64 --> 00:07:53.64 So I would.
00:07:53.64 --> 00:07:59.64 I was on the competition team and I would like give people lessons on how to ride that thing.
00:07:59.64 --> 00:08:03.64 So between that dodge ball.
00:08:03.64 --> 00:08:06.64 You kind of dialed in first of first of action.
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:07.64 That's right.
00:08:07.64 --> 00:08:08.64 That's a good set up.
00:08:08.64 --> 00:08:13.64 So you recommend if someone wants to get a career special operations they focus on dodge ball.
00:08:13.64 --> 00:08:17.64 I'm wrestling and surfing.
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:18.64 Awesome.
00:08:18.64 --> 00:08:20.64 For which I formed me, I first succeeded.
00:08:20.64 --> 00:08:22.64 I formed the first success.
00:08:22.64 --> 00:08:25.64 And so you're you're you're doing these jobs.
00:08:25.64 --> 00:08:28.64 And you're you're not having a good time with.
00:08:28.64 --> 00:08:33.64 Yeah, I was you know, not a very good.
00:08:33.64 --> 00:08:35.64 A studious.
00:08:35.64 --> 00:08:37.64 A student in high school.
00:08:37.64 --> 00:08:42.64 You know, high school is more of like a socialization.
00:08:42.64 --> 00:08:46.64 For me, like I really enjoyed going there to socialize.
00:08:46.64 --> 00:08:49.64 I enjoyed, you know, making friends.
00:08:49.64 --> 00:08:51.64 And I liked sports.
00:08:51.64 --> 00:08:56.64 And I was always I always loved working and making money.
00:08:56.64 --> 00:08:59.64 You know, like school is just kind of in the way.
00:08:59.64 --> 00:09:07.64 I'd kind of, you know, at the time I just had zero interest in any sort of classwork whatsoever.
00:09:07.64 --> 00:09:14.64 And I don't even understand how I somehow I graduated.
00:09:14.64 --> 00:09:20.64 And then, you know, I was like, yeah, I'm definitely going to do something in life.
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:22.64 I don't know what.
00:09:22.64 --> 00:09:24.64 I'm assuming it'll be good though.
00:09:24.64 --> 00:09:26.64 You know, I just don't know what it is.
00:09:26.64 --> 00:09:30.64 And my teachers were kind of in that same mindset.
00:09:30.64 --> 00:09:32.64 They're, you know, half of them were just like,
00:09:32.64 --> 00:09:35.64 man, they're you're hopeless.
00:09:35.64 --> 00:09:38.64 Like there's you're just going to work at Burger King, whatever.
00:09:38.64 --> 00:09:42.64 And then the other half where just like, yeah, you're going to do something great.
00:09:42.64 --> 00:09:45.64 It's definitely not going to be in school.
00:09:45.64 --> 00:09:47.64 You know, who knows what it is.
00:09:47.64 --> 00:09:51.64 And I was just kind of in that, you know, glass half full.
00:09:51.64 --> 00:09:54.64 I was thinking the same thing.
00:09:54.64 --> 00:09:56.64 And I didn't know what it was honestly.
00:09:56.64 --> 00:09:58.64 Like I said, I was roofing.
00:09:58.64 --> 00:10:01.64 And I really loved roofing.
00:10:01.64 --> 00:10:05.64 But, you know, I was making minimal money.
00:10:05.64 --> 00:10:09.64 And I knew that that wasn't going to be it.
00:10:09.64 --> 00:10:12.64 So I was in the area.
00:10:12.64 --> 00:10:15.64 I knew that nothing around the area interested me.
00:10:15.64 --> 00:10:19.64 You know, there was nothing that I wanted to pursue around there.
00:10:19.64 --> 00:10:20.64 I was young.
00:10:20.64 --> 00:10:22.64 I was 18.
00:10:22.64 --> 00:10:26.64 You know, my my mom and dad were both and my stepdad were,
00:10:26.64 --> 00:10:30.64 were all in the Navy at points in their life.
00:10:30.64 --> 00:10:33.64 And, you know, had talked about the benefits of the military.
00:10:33.64 --> 00:10:36.64 My dad was always trying to get me to go in the military.
00:10:36.64 --> 00:10:39.64 And I just wasn't interested at all.
00:10:39.64 --> 00:10:46.64 And, yeah, that was never really even a consideration until quite literally,
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:48.64 like, I was just bored.
00:10:48.64 --> 00:10:51.64 And the recruiter happened to walk in, catch me.
00:10:51.64 --> 00:10:53.64 And I was like, hey, you want to join the Navy?
00:10:53.64 --> 00:10:55.64 And I was like, sure, why not?
00:10:55.64 --> 00:10:58.64 And I was at first.
00:10:58.64 --> 00:11:01.64 I was going to do master dorms.
00:11:01.64 --> 00:11:05.64 Like I was like, you know, I've always had like a kind of respect for
00:11:05.64 --> 00:11:06.64 police.
00:11:06.64 --> 00:11:09.64 My grandfather's a police officer.
00:11:09.64 --> 00:11:12.64 My uncle's still a police officer.
00:11:12.64 --> 00:11:18.64 And that was something that I felt like, you know, was a courageous job and a helpful,
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:23.64 useful one or whatever, you know, and I figured that I could,
00:11:23.64 --> 00:11:25.64 I've always been real protective as well.
00:11:25.64 --> 00:11:30.64 So like, I figured that job would kind of maybe be fitting for me.
00:11:30.64 --> 00:11:34.64 So he had asked me, you know, hey, yeah,
00:11:34.64 --> 00:11:35.64 you want to join the Navy?
00:11:35.64 --> 00:11:39.64 And I was like, okay, then I thought I'll go that route.
00:11:39.64 --> 00:11:42.64 And he was like, well, you look like you're a good shape.
00:11:42.64 --> 00:11:44.64 Do you want to be a seal?
00:11:44.64 --> 00:11:48.64 And I was like, there's a sneaky guy, you know?
00:11:48.64 --> 00:11:54.64 The only thing I knew about seals was from that commercial where the,
00:11:54.64 --> 00:11:59.64 where they're on the beach or it's a scene on the beach and the clouds roll over
00:11:59.64 --> 00:12:00.64 the moon.
00:12:00.64 --> 00:12:02.64 And then they had the full transparency.
00:12:02.64 --> 00:12:07.64 And so that's all I knew about Navy seals and I was like, oh,
00:12:07.64 --> 00:12:08.64 guys, what's the biggest?
00:12:08.64 --> 00:12:12.64 This was 2000 and seven.
00:12:12.64 --> 00:12:17.64 Jay, so you're watching the wars are going on all through high school.
00:12:17.64 --> 00:12:19.64 You're seeing all that stuff take place.
00:12:19.64 --> 00:12:20.64 Hmm.
00:12:20.64 --> 00:12:22.64 Well, 9-11-1-7th grade.
00:12:22.64 --> 00:12:23.64 Yeah.
00:12:23.64 --> 00:12:26.64 You were probably boots on drown or something like that.
00:12:26.64 --> 00:12:29.64 Well, I mean, I was, I was,
00:12:29.64 --> 00:12:33.64 um, yeah, I had been in for like 11 years at that point.
00:12:33.64 --> 00:12:34.64 So I joined in 90.
00:12:34.64 --> 00:12:36.64 So I was born in 80.
00:12:36.64 --> 00:12:37.64 Yeah.
00:12:37.64 --> 00:12:37.64 Yeah.
00:12:37.64 --> 00:12:41.64 So I'm a little bit older than you are, apparently.
00:12:41.64 --> 00:12:42.64 Yeah.
00:12:42.64 --> 00:12:46.64 So did you not, did you realize like,
00:12:46.64 --> 00:12:51.64 um, so this was your first kind of connection because for me,
00:12:51.64 --> 00:12:56.64 when I was growing up, like every time some kind of war event happened,
00:12:56.64 --> 00:13:01.64 I was all bummed out that I wasn't there because I was too young.
00:13:01.64 --> 00:13:05.64 And that's just the way I was always thinking about that.
00:13:05.64 --> 00:13:08.64 I was always into the military, but you were kind of like, not.
00:13:08.64 --> 00:13:09.64 I was the total opposite.
00:13:09.64 --> 00:13:13.64 Like I wanted nothing to do with the military.
00:13:13.64 --> 00:13:15.64 I wanted nothing to do with like,
00:13:15.64 --> 00:13:17.64 I'd never even thought about it.
00:13:17.64 --> 00:13:20.64 Um, my dad was just, you know, he was in and he was a combat
00:13:20.64 --> 00:13:22.64 cameraman with devgrip.
00:13:22.64 --> 00:13:26.64 So he was, you know, really involved with it.
00:13:26.64 --> 00:13:29.64 And anytime he would try and talk to me, I'm just like,
00:13:29.64 --> 00:13:30.64 I'm not interested.
00:13:30.64 --> 00:13:32.64 I'm not enjoying the fucking military.
00:13:32.64 --> 00:13:35.64 But you don't know what flip the switch.
00:13:35.64 --> 00:13:36.64 Just mega boredom.
00:13:36.64 --> 00:13:37.64 Yeah.
00:13:37.64 --> 00:13:40.64 Just, I just, you know,
00:13:40.64 --> 00:13:44.64 I was like, well, worst case scenario.
00:13:44.64 --> 00:13:47.64 I know, I don't know, I'm in for in the Navy for four years.
00:13:47.64 --> 00:13:49.64 I'll go see the world a little bit.
00:13:49.64 --> 00:13:53.64 I'll, you know, gain some life experience and worst case.
00:13:53.64 --> 00:13:55.64 I get out and I'm fucking 22.
00:13:55.64 --> 00:13:55.64 Yeah.
00:13:55.64 --> 00:13:57.64 Like, I'm not going to college.
00:13:57.64 --> 00:14:00.64 I know that, you know, high school is.
00:14:00.64 --> 00:14:02.64 I barely made it through that.
00:14:02.64 --> 00:14:05.64 And just not because I was stupid, just because I just.
00:14:05.64 --> 00:14:07.64 Man, wasn't your scene.
00:14:07.64 --> 00:14:08.64 Oh, my God.
00:14:08.64 --> 00:14:12.64 I'd rather do hell week 10 times in a row than right in essay.
00:14:12.64 --> 00:14:13.64 You know.
00:14:13.64 --> 00:14:18.64 So you get in the Navy and do you prepare at all?
00:14:18.64 --> 00:14:23.64 Like, for I had never run like further than a mile.
00:14:23.64 --> 00:14:27.64 And like, I, all my sport stuff was all sprinting.
00:14:27.64 --> 00:14:29.64 I mean, those dodgeballs are only, you know,
00:14:29.64 --> 00:14:31.64 dodgeball courts are small.
00:14:31.64 --> 00:14:32.64 Yeah, they're, they're short.
00:14:32.64 --> 00:14:35.64 So it's just, I was always a really fast sprinter.
00:14:35.64 --> 00:14:39.64 And that was kind of all I really cared about.
00:14:39.64 --> 00:14:43.64 I, I didn't even, I was also, I also, like,
00:14:43.64 --> 00:14:47.64 now looking back how stupid I was and just how dumb you are at eight.
00:14:47.64 --> 00:14:50.64 Like you think you really, like, no, when you're 18,
00:14:50.64 --> 00:14:53.64 you really, like, you're like, man, you know,
00:14:53.64 --> 00:14:55.64 you look back at when you're 10.
00:14:55.64 --> 00:14:57.64 They're like, man, I know so much.
00:14:57.64 --> 00:15:00.64 Yeah, I just compared to my seven year old self.
00:15:00.64 --> 00:15:02.64 I'm compared to my eight year old self.
00:15:02.64 --> 00:15:05.64 I didn't even know what I was doing.
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:08.64 Now I'm a, I'm a man, you know, I know what, what life's about.
00:15:08.64 --> 00:15:12.64 But at that point, obviously, now I'm 30 looking back at that.
00:15:12.64 --> 00:15:14.64 I'm just like, man, you're so dumb.
00:15:14.64 --> 00:15:18.64 But I really was and just really in experience with life.
00:15:18.64 --> 00:15:21.64 I never, like I said, run really further than a mile.
00:15:21.64 --> 00:15:24.64 I didn't even understand, like, that people did that.
00:15:24.64 --> 00:15:27.64 I'd heard about, like, marathon's and stuff.
00:15:27.64 --> 00:15:33.64 But, you know, I remember when, you know, when I'd heard that,
00:15:33.64 --> 00:15:36.64 I had to run like a mile and a half for the PST.
00:15:36.64 --> 00:15:38.64 I was just like, what in the fuck?
00:15:38.64 --> 00:15:39.64 Like, why?
00:15:39.64 --> 00:15:43.64 And then, and then, like, I told my dad that I said,
00:15:43.64 --> 00:15:46.64 I told my dad that I signed up for the, the seal teams.
00:15:46.64 --> 00:15:48.64 And I was like, yeah, I'm going to be a seal.
00:15:48.64 --> 00:15:52.64 And he's just like, you have no idea what you just signed up for.
00:15:52.64 --> 00:15:54.64 I didn't even know I had to go to Buds.
00:15:54.64 --> 00:15:59.64 And then, so he, he, he, he, he, I was just like, yeah,
00:15:59.64 --> 00:16:00.64 I'm going to be a seal.
00:16:00.64 --> 00:16:01.64 What's wrong with that?
00:16:01.64 --> 00:16:06.64 And he, he bought me the two, three, four documentary.
00:16:06.64 --> 00:16:07.64 Mm-hmm.
00:16:07.64 --> 00:16:09.64 And we sat down and watched that.
00:16:09.64 --> 00:16:15.64 And I remember like, just watching the, the four mile time run.
00:16:15.64 --> 00:16:18.64 And I was just thinking like, is that even possible?
00:16:18.64 --> 00:16:21.64 Like, do people really do that?
00:16:21.64 --> 00:16:24.64 And I was just thinking like, Jesus Christ.
00:16:24.64 --> 00:16:27.64 Like, this is, I'm going to have to do all of this shit.
00:16:27.64 --> 00:16:30.64 Oh my God, I better start running.
00:16:30.64 --> 00:16:31.64 I better start training.
00:16:31.64 --> 00:16:33.64 So did you start running and training?
00:16:33.64 --> 00:16:36.64 Yeah, I mean, I, I, I went out and, you know,
00:16:36.64 --> 00:16:39.64 actually back up before I even saw that.
00:16:39.64 --> 00:16:45.64 The first, the first introduction I had to buzz was I,
00:16:45.64 --> 00:16:47.64 or Navy Seals in general.
00:16:47.64 --> 00:16:50.64 Once I signed the, like, a signed up, I was like,
00:16:50.64 --> 00:16:51.64 I'm going to be a Navy Seal.
00:16:51.64 --> 00:16:53.64 I better do some research.
00:16:53.64 --> 00:16:57.64 So it went out and got Navy Seals with Charlie Sheen.
00:16:57.64 --> 00:16:58.64 And I watched that.
00:16:58.64 --> 00:17:02.64 And that was my very first introduction to what Navy Seals were.
00:17:02.64 --> 00:17:05.64 And I was just like, man, looks pretty intense.
00:17:05.64 --> 00:17:07.64 Pretty cool though.
00:17:07.64 --> 00:17:11.64 And, you know, in the scene, in that movie,
00:17:11.64 --> 00:17:15.64 they say it's buds, but it's obviously not because it's like in the woods.
00:17:15.64 --> 00:17:18.64 And they're like, there's like grenades going off.
00:17:18.64 --> 00:17:22.64 And they're like, they're like, army crawling under barb wire.
00:17:22.64 --> 00:17:24.64 And he's like, this is buds, you know, like,
00:17:24.64 --> 00:17:27.64 it's just like this crazy scene or whatever.
00:17:27.64 --> 00:17:30.64 And I was just thinking like, damn, I got to go through all that.
00:17:30.64 --> 00:17:31.64 All right, better.
00:17:31.64 --> 00:17:34.64 So I went out and bought some fucking camo pants.
00:17:34.64 --> 00:17:37.64 I bought some boots, like just leather boots.
00:17:37.64 --> 00:17:43.64 And I went for a run down my street.
00:17:43.64 --> 00:17:45.64 And I remember it was like a mile.
00:17:45.64 --> 00:17:48.64 All right, I did, I was like, I have to run a mile and half.
00:17:48.64 --> 00:17:50.64 So I'm going to see how this goes.
00:17:50.64 --> 00:17:53.64 And I went and got those pants and got suited up.
00:17:53.64 --> 00:17:55.64 Fuck you.
00:17:55.64 --> 00:18:00.64 And I was just thinking, like, oh, man, this is going to be hard.
00:18:00.64 --> 00:18:05.64 But then then my dad got the two, three, four documentary.
00:18:05.64 --> 00:18:10.64 And then that was just like, oh, okay, I really just have no fucking idea what I just signed up for.
00:18:10.64 --> 00:18:14.64 And I was just thinking like, damn, that looks really hard.
00:18:14.64 --> 00:18:17.64 But I already told everyone that I was going to do this.
00:18:17.64 --> 00:18:22.64 And I was just kind of that, you know, that's one good thing about being a teen.
00:18:22.64 --> 00:18:25.64 And you're just young and dumb and stubborn.
00:18:25.64 --> 00:18:32.64 And luckily I used the, the good of that to get through, I guess.
00:18:32.64 --> 00:18:37.64 So you get, I was going to say, you know, my, my, my, my, my, my,
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:42.64 Dive motivator was Mike Noss, you know, yes, I know who it is.
00:18:42.64 --> 00:18:45.64 I don't know personally about, well, he's, he's a old,
00:18:45.64 --> 00:18:49.64 Vietnam frogman, a plank owner at, at, at,
00:18:49.64 --> 00:18:57.64 a damn neck and he came in and he's a tall guy and he walks with like a kind of a big limp
00:18:57.64 --> 00:18:59.64 because he had like a hip replacement.
00:18:59.64 --> 00:19:01.64 He still swims like a fish.
00:19:01.64 --> 00:19:08.64 And he actually taught me how to do the side stroke the day before my PST.
00:19:08.64 --> 00:19:12.64 So it was like pretty steep learning curve.
00:19:12.64 --> 00:19:17.64 Yeah, that's, that is I always tell people not to make decisions
00:19:17.64 --> 00:19:19.64 when they're super emotional.
00:19:19.64 --> 00:19:23.64 And so I'm going to start adding, don't make decisions when you're super just bored.
00:19:23.64 --> 00:19:26.64 Yeah, you might end up at Buds.
00:19:26.64 --> 00:19:29.64 So you show up there, you show up to Buds.
00:19:29.64 --> 00:19:33.64 And you must, you know, obviously you made it through.
00:19:33.64 --> 00:19:35.64 Was already, what was it was tough for you and Buds?
00:19:35.64 --> 00:19:41.64 Running running was definitely, I mean, obviously that's like what you do the most of.
00:19:41.64 --> 00:19:43.64 And, um,
00:19:43.64 --> 00:19:51.64 man, it was just, I went from no running ever to running my ass off just everywhere.
00:19:51.64 --> 00:19:59.64 And, uh, and those time runs man, I was just fucking having a lot of conversations with Jesus.
00:19:59.64 --> 00:20:07.64 And those runs and just, you know, given it everything I fucking had just to make the cut off on those runs.
00:20:07.64 --> 00:20:11.64 And then, and then I, eventually I became like a pretty good runner just from doing it.
00:20:11.64 --> 00:20:17.64 And, um, but yeah, I was, I was for sure captain of the Goon Squad.
00:20:17.64 --> 00:20:23.64 And, uh, but luckily all those fucking dodgeball sprints were paying off in the Goon Squad.
00:20:23.64 --> 00:20:27.64 So it was, it was nice, uh, in the Goon Squad I felt comfortable.
00:20:27.64 --> 00:20:29.64 Did you get rolled for anything?
00:20:29.64 --> 00:20:37.64 Yes, I got rolled, um, uh, for some, I had real bad chance blunts from from the, the lack of running.
00:20:37.64 --> 00:20:41.64 Previous and, uh, but other, you know, got rolled, dealt with that.
00:20:41.64 --> 00:20:45.64 And, like I said, I picked up, like, from running so much.
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:47.64 I just got good at it.
00:20:47.64 --> 00:20:51.64 And I was, like, young, so adapted well, I guess.
00:20:51.64 --> 00:20:53.64 Yeah, it's, it pays to be young in Buds.
00:20:53.64 --> 00:20:55.64 In my opinion.
00:20:55.64 --> 00:20:55.64 Yeah, oh.
00:20:55.64 --> 00:21:01.64 So I'm a physical perspective physically, yeah, for sure, with, like, dealing with, uh, overuse injuries.
00:21:01.64 --> 00:21:05.64 I mean, because you're definitely gonna, just,
00:21:05.64 --> 00:21:07.64 they're obviously just gonna fucking rem your ass.
00:21:07.64 --> 00:21:09.64 And then you have to get up and go.
00:21:09.64 --> 00:21:17.64 Yeah, I was talking to, uh, one of the medical guys there who came from, like, a sports environment,
00:21:17.64 --> 00:21:19.64 like the, I think the NFL.
00:21:19.64 --> 00:21:21.64 I think it was the NFL.
00:21:21.64 --> 00:21:25.64 And do you remember the, uh, I think it's Petella Femoral Syndrome?
00:21:25.64 --> 00:21:27.64 Did you ever know anyone that got that there?
00:21:27.64 --> 00:21:31.64 Anyways, there's a bunch of people that get this, this, this Petella Femoral Syndrome.
00:21:31.64 --> 00:21:33.64 You know, they're, and he said, yeah, at Buds,
00:21:33.64 --> 00:21:37.64 I would see 10 cases a week of Petella Femoral Syndrome.
00:21:37.64 --> 00:21:41.64 It's where your Petella, like, rub's against your, your, your,
00:21:41.64 --> 00:21:43.64 femur or something.
00:21:43.64 --> 00:21:47.64 And he said, in the NFL, you'd see, like, one of these,
00:21:47.64 --> 00:21:49.64 every year, maybe one a year.
00:21:49.64 --> 00:21:53.64 And so these guys that would come to Buds for,
00:21:53.64 --> 00:21:57.64 from a physical, what was athletic trainer perspective,
00:21:57.64 --> 00:21:59.64 would learn so much because they're just getting these,
00:21:59.64 --> 00:22:01.64 Matt, these bodies are just going through abuse,
00:22:01.64 --> 00:22:03.64 like, no other bodies.
00:22:03.64 --> 00:22:05.64 And so they see all those, all these common injuries that you get to
00:22:05.64 --> 00:22:09.64 knees, your, your shoulders, your back, like, that's what you go to
00:22:09.64 --> 00:22:11.64 Buds as an athletic trainer.
00:22:11.64 --> 00:22:15.64 You learn, and as a doctor, you learn so much about how to
00:22:15.64 --> 00:22:19.64 deal with these things because you see 10 times more than you would,
00:22:19.64 --> 00:22:21.64 or more than you would anywhere else.
00:22:21.64 --> 00:22:23.64 Yeah, I believe it.
00:22:23.64 --> 00:22:27.64 But I've also talked to people who say, like, I was young,
00:22:27.64 --> 00:22:28.64 so you go in two Buds.
00:22:28.64 --> 00:22:29.64 How old were you?
00:22:29.64 --> 00:22:35.64 And so you get the, you get the, you get the mind of,
00:22:35.64 --> 00:22:37.64 hey, I just do whatever they tell me to do, you know?
00:22:37.64 --> 00:22:39.64 But there's some people that say,
00:22:39.64 --> 00:22:43.64 I have told me they didn't think they were mature enough at 18 or 19
00:22:43.64 --> 00:22:45.64 to go through Buds.
00:22:45.64 --> 00:22:49.64 Um, I, for sure, was not, I don't want to say,
00:22:49.64 --> 00:22:51.64 I wasn't mature enough to go through because obviously I did,
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:53.64 and I made it through.
00:22:53.64 --> 00:22:55.64 However, you say, like, what, or ask, like,
00:22:55.64 --> 00:22:57.64 what my biggest struggle at Buds was,
00:22:57.64 --> 00:22:59.64 was definitely my maturity.
00:22:59.64 --> 00:23:01.64 I mean, physically, like, physically it was running,
00:23:01.64 --> 00:23:05.64 like, just, I was never a long distance run,
00:23:05.64 --> 00:23:09.64 or obviously, um, sprinting.
00:23:09.64 --> 00:23:11.64 I was fast as fuck, sprinting,
00:23:11.64 --> 00:23:15.64 and I was really strong on the log and like the boats.
00:23:15.64 --> 00:23:19.64 The boats on heads was extremely surprising to me.
00:23:19.64 --> 00:23:23.64 I, like, I remember seeing it in the videos and thinking, like,
00:23:23.64 --> 00:23:25.64 okay, that's kind of weird, like, why are they running around boats on their
00:23:25.64 --> 00:23:27.64 heads?
00:23:27.64 --> 00:23:29.64 Like, and then, uh,
00:23:29.64 --> 00:23:33.64 I didn't think it was going to be painful because they're, like,
00:23:33.64 --> 00:23:35.64 inflatable to rubber boats or whatever,
00:23:35.64 --> 00:23:37.64 and then when they put that thing on your head,
00:23:37.64 --> 00:23:39.64 I was just like, Jesus Christ.
00:23:39.64 --> 00:23:41.64 This thing is smashing my fucking neck.
00:23:41.64 --> 00:23:45.64 Did the instructors jump around in the boats when you went through,
00:23:45.64 --> 00:23:47.64 because you stopped doing it at some point?
00:23:47.64 --> 00:23:49.64 They would, uh, like, some of the little guys would, like,
00:23:49.64 --> 00:23:53.64 jump and hang on the handles and, and shit like that when,
00:23:53.64 --> 00:23:57.64 when you're riding, but yeah, you definitely knew when they were on the boats,
00:23:57.64 --> 00:23:59.64 because they got a lot heavier, but...
00:23:59.64 --> 00:24:02.64 What they would do when I went through and they stopped doing this,
00:24:02.64 --> 00:24:03.64 which is a good thing.
00:24:03.64 --> 00:24:06.64 They would, they would be, like, the boats would be lined up,
00:24:06.64 --> 00:24:09.64 and we'd have them in head carry, and the instructors would be in, like,
00:24:09.64 --> 00:24:11.64 boat one and ride.
00:24:11.64 --> 00:24:14.64 And then they would just jump into boat two and then jump in boat three.
00:24:14.64 --> 00:24:18.64 And I remember hearing when they would did that to me,
00:24:18.64 --> 00:24:20.64 a couple of the times that they did it to me.
00:24:20.64 --> 00:24:23.64 I heard like this deep kind of...
00:24:23.64 --> 00:24:27.64 ...inside my neck.
00:24:27.64 --> 00:24:30.64 And I remember thinking, this is probably not good.
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:33.64 And they stopped doing it thankfully, because that's not healthy.
00:24:33.64 --> 00:24:35.64 So you actually used to be like six, too.
00:24:35.64 --> 00:24:39.64 I don't know if I got shorter, but I definitely took some,
00:24:39.64 --> 00:24:40.64 took some damage.
00:24:40.64 --> 00:24:42.64 Took some damage for sure.
00:24:42.64 --> 00:24:47.64 Yeah, that was, that, the boats on heads was probably the most surprising thing
00:24:47.64 --> 00:24:52.64 to me of how, like I just wasn't expecting it to be that bad.
00:24:52.64 --> 00:24:56.64 And, but like the log PT, you know, I was all,
00:24:56.64 --> 00:24:58.64 I actually really enjoyed the log PT.
00:24:58.64 --> 00:25:00.64 I think probably because from roofing, you know,
00:25:00.64 --> 00:25:03.64 I was always carrying those 80 pound bundles of shingles
00:25:03.64 --> 00:25:06.64 up the ladder, and then like, I was the young guy on the crew,
00:25:06.64 --> 00:25:08.64 so I was the shingle bit for a few years.
00:25:08.64 --> 00:25:12.64 And, you know, everyone, everyone on my crew is in their 40s.
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:16.64 So they, you know, I was the 15 year old when I came on the crew,
00:25:16.64 --> 00:25:20.64 and just a young, strong kid, they took full advantage of it,
00:25:20.64 --> 00:25:23.64 and just wherever they needed shingles on the roof,
00:25:23.64 --> 00:25:25.64 that's where I hauled them up.
00:25:25.64 --> 00:25:29.64 And so I was used to carrying, you know, that heavy load
00:25:29.64 --> 00:25:33.64 and stuff, I, like I said, I felt really good on that stuff.
00:25:33.64 --> 00:25:35.64 And mentally I was like,
00:25:35.64 --> 00:25:39.64 I just was super competitive.
00:25:39.64 --> 00:25:44.64 And that's what really got me through Buds,
00:25:44.64 --> 00:25:47.64 was just that sheer competitiveness.
00:25:47.64 --> 00:25:49.64 Where did the maturity level?
00:25:49.64 --> 00:25:52.64 Where could that have tripped you up?
00:25:52.64 --> 00:25:55.64 Were you like doing dumb stuff on the weekends where you...
00:25:55.64 --> 00:25:57.64 No, not really.
00:25:57.64 --> 00:26:01.64 Because I mean, I wasn't even old enough to go drink or anything like that.
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:07.64 So it was more just kind of not understanding,
00:26:07.64 --> 00:26:10.64 well, one, like I was different.
00:26:10.64 --> 00:26:12.64 I was different than most people there,
00:26:12.64 --> 00:26:16.64 because like you said, you wanted to be in the military your whole life.
00:26:16.64 --> 00:26:19.64 And like you wanted to be a seal on Masumi.
00:26:19.64 --> 00:26:20.64 Did you?
00:26:20.64 --> 00:26:22.64 Yeah, I mean, as soon as I kind of figured out what the seal themes were.
00:26:22.64 --> 00:26:23.64 Yeah.
00:26:23.64 --> 00:26:24.64 Yeah.
00:26:24.64 --> 00:26:27.64 So like that, and just how you are,
00:26:27.64 --> 00:26:29.64 you're very disciplined, you're very, you know,
00:26:29.64 --> 00:26:31.64 you're very militant, I would say.
00:26:31.64 --> 00:26:33.64 And I would have concur.
00:26:33.64 --> 00:26:34.64 Yeah.
00:26:34.64 --> 00:26:40.64 I was like more of like a wild, like free spirit kind of,
00:26:40.64 --> 00:26:42.64 you know, kid growing up.
00:26:42.64 --> 00:26:46.64 And I was not militant at all.
00:26:46.64 --> 00:26:53.64 And so, and I also like, getting through bootcamp was difficult for me
00:26:53.64 --> 00:26:55.64 because of that as well.
00:26:55.64 --> 00:26:58.64 You know, just like, I'm like, why, why?
00:26:58.64 --> 00:27:01.64 My question was like, why do we have to...
00:27:01.64 --> 00:27:02.64 Make our...
00:27:02.64 --> 00:27:03.64 Make our...
00:27:03.64 --> 00:27:08.64 We're literally spent all day undoing our bed and remaking it.
00:27:08.64 --> 00:27:10.64 I was like, I... What the fuck?
00:27:10.64 --> 00:27:11.64 This is the point of this.
00:27:11.64 --> 00:27:13.64 Like, it's such a waste of time.
00:27:13.64 --> 00:27:16.64 And, you know, obviously it's all for a reason and design,
00:27:16.64 --> 00:27:18.64 but I just... I couldn't wrap my head around it.
00:27:18.64 --> 00:27:23.64 So that just lack of military bearing and lack of maturity and understanding,
00:27:23.64 --> 00:27:26.64 like why things are the way they are and, you know,
00:27:26.64 --> 00:27:28.64 the whole military structure of just...
00:27:28.64 --> 00:27:31.64 You just do it and, you know, questions, stuff like that.
00:27:31.64 --> 00:27:34.64 You know, that was probably...
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:37.64 My biggest hang up, you know, just...
00:27:37.64 --> 00:27:39.64 I was different than everyone I was young.
00:27:39.64 --> 00:27:41.64 I was... I don't know.
00:27:41.64 --> 00:27:45.64 I... I didn't want to be a seal my whole life.
00:27:45.64 --> 00:27:47.64 You know, some of these people, like, this is like their dream
00:27:47.64 --> 00:27:49.64 and they've been training for it for whatever.
00:27:49.64 --> 00:27:53.64 And I'm just kind of here showing up and guys are quitting and...
00:27:53.64 --> 00:27:55.64 And I'm not.
00:27:55.64 --> 00:27:58.64 And, you know, and, you know, and, like, physically I was doing, like,
00:27:58.64 --> 00:28:00.64 a lot better than something that I've been doing.
00:28:00.64 --> 00:28:04.64 And, you know, and, like, physically I was doing, like, a lot better than some guys
00:28:04.64 --> 00:28:07.64 who, like I said, it was kind of just like,
00:28:07.64 --> 00:28:09.64 wow, I'm just here whatever doing this.
00:28:09.64 --> 00:28:12.64 And other guys that's like, this is everything to me.
00:28:12.64 --> 00:28:15.64 And, you know, so...
00:28:15.64 --> 00:28:17.64 It's like, I...
00:28:17.64 --> 00:28:22.64 Jack, so you get done with Buds and you show up in where do you go?
00:28:22.64 --> 00:28:23.64 Team 10?
00:28:23.64 --> 00:28:24.64 Team 10, yep.
00:28:24.64 --> 00:28:26.64 Right on. And then, well, how was that?
00:28:26.64 --> 00:28:28.64 Checking into Team 10.
00:28:28.64 --> 00:28:31.64 It was... it was cool, but by that point, you know,
00:28:31.64 --> 00:28:34.64 I'd kind of, like, uh...
00:28:34.64 --> 00:28:37.64 Obviously, I was like, alright, I'm a seal now and...
00:28:37.64 --> 00:28:40.64 and I had been in the... in the pipeline for a while
00:28:40.64 --> 00:28:45.64 and kind of getting in the flow of things and the military
00:28:45.64 --> 00:28:47.64 and stuff like that.
00:28:47.64 --> 00:28:48.64 But, uh...
00:28:48.64 --> 00:28:52.64 Jack, go... I was super excited to check in to Team 10.
00:28:52.64 --> 00:28:54.64 Um, and I...
00:28:54.64 --> 00:28:56.64 Originally, I was going to go to Team 5.
00:28:56.64 --> 00:29:00.64 And then, I... I told my family, you know, that I got orders to 5.
00:29:00.64 --> 00:29:02.64 And they were all kind of bummed out because they...
00:29:02.64 --> 00:29:04.64 They won it. They're all in the East Coast.
00:29:04.64 --> 00:29:08.64 And, um... they were like, oh man, you know, we were hoping you'd come to the East Coast.
00:29:08.64 --> 00:29:10.64 And I was like, uh... okay, I'll go to the East Coast.
00:29:10.64 --> 00:29:14.64 And I thought it was, like, kind of cool too, because...
00:29:14.64 --> 00:29:19.64 It felt like a... like a new... like a new chapter
00:29:19.64 --> 00:29:21.64 because, like, you know, the...
00:29:21.64 --> 00:29:26.64 the... Seal Team 1, 3 and 5, or 7 or right by the Buds compound.
00:29:26.64 --> 00:29:33.64 So it was, like, you know, I'd been there and been in the scene for the last two years or whatever it was.
00:29:33.64 --> 00:29:39.64 And it was... it was cool. It felt cool to, like, go across the country and, like, check into a team.
00:29:39.64 --> 00:29:43.64 And, you know, I just felt like, like, this is it. This is real deal.
00:29:43.64 --> 00:29:46.64 So it was super cool. I felt... felt good.
00:29:46.64 --> 00:29:48.64 Um... my trip was awesome.
00:29:48.64 --> 00:29:52.64 And... and... What was your job in your first poll, too?
00:29:52.64 --> 00:29:54.64 I was a heavy gunner for sure.
00:29:54.64 --> 00:29:57.64 A-dum.
00:29:57.64 --> 00:29:58.64 A knuckle dragger.
00:29:58.64 --> 00:29:59.64 Yeah, yeah.
00:29:59.64 --> 00:29:59.64 Yeah.
00:29:59.64 --> 00:30:02.64 That's a classic new guy.
00:30:02.64 --> 00:30:05.64 Strong new guy. Guess what?
00:30:05.64 --> 00:30:05.64 Yeah.
00:30:05.64 --> 00:30:06.64 From the pig.
00:30:06.64 --> 00:30:08.64 Your big, strong new guy? Got something for you.
00:30:08.64 --> 00:30:09.64 And I loved it.
00:30:09.64 --> 00:30:10.64 Yeah.
00:30:10.64 --> 00:30:14.64 I am... I am braced at, I didn't think it was like a bad thing, you know.
00:30:14.64 --> 00:30:16.64 And what year is this now?
00:30:16.64 --> 00:30:18.64 2009.
00:30:18.64 --> 00:30:21.64 Okay. So you went straight to the... to the Mark 48.
00:30:21.64 --> 00:30:22.64 No end of 60 for you.
00:30:22.64 --> 00:30:23.64 Mm-hmm.
00:30:23.64 --> 00:30:25.64 That's... that's... that's nice.
00:30:25.64 --> 00:30:28.64 Yeah. We shot 60s and stuff, but no...
00:30:28.64 --> 00:30:30.64 What, like, a fam shoot with 60s or something?
00:30:30.64 --> 00:30:34.64 Yeah. And there were 60s on, like, homies and stuff like that,
00:30:34.64 --> 00:30:36.64 going through, uh, vehicle stuff.
00:30:36.64 --> 00:30:39.64 So there were still a little bit of transition taking place.
00:30:39.64 --> 00:30:40.64 Mm-hmm.
00:30:40.64 --> 00:30:42.64 So you're a pig gunner, your first poll tune.
00:30:42.64 --> 00:30:44.64 How was your first work-up?
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:46.64 It was awesome.
00:30:46.64 --> 00:30:48.64 It was definitely a good time.
00:30:48.64 --> 00:30:52.64 Got what surprised you about, like, going through work-up,
00:30:52.64 --> 00:30:53.64 being in a seal-potir.
00:30:53.64 --> 00:30:55.64 What was different than what you thought it was.
00:30:55.64 --> 00:30:59.64 What was different from how it was for Charlie Sheen?
00:30:59.64 --> 00:31:01.64 Mm-hmm.
00:31:01.64 --> 00:31:03.64 You know?
00:31:03.64 --> 00:31:08.64 It was... it was a lot like the movie.
00:31:08.64 --> 00:31:10.64 I'm just kidding.
00:31:10.64 --> 00:31:12.64 It was... it was great, man.
00:31:12.64 --> 00:31:14.64 I thought it was a lot of fun.
00:31:14.64 --> 00:31:16.64 We got to travel...
00:31:16.64 --> 00:31:18.64 Travel the country.
00:31:18.64 --> 00:31:20.64 That was a cool thing too about the East Coast.
00:31:20.64 --> 00:31:24.64 Um, the training sites were kind of all over all over,
00:31:24.64 --> 00:31:26.64 versus the West Coast.
00:31:26.64 --> 00:31:28.64 It was kind of like the same song and dance, like,
00:31:28.64 --> 00:31:30.64 Nyland and...
00:31:30.64 --> 00:31:31.64 and, uh...
00:31:31.64 --> 00:31:33.64 Let's see other one.
00:31:33.64 --> 00:31:34.64 Yeah.
00:31:34.64 --> 00:31:36.64 You know, in the training,
00:31:36.64 --> 00:31:38.64 the training's like all the same sites.
00:31:38.64 --> 00:31:43.64 And, uh, so, going to the East Coast, I got to see a bunch of new places.
00:31:43.64 --> 00:31:46.64 And that was cool to me, just kind of seeing the world.
00:31:46.64 --> 00:31:50.64 Um, and the... the brotherhood of, like,
00:31:50.64 --> 00:31:52.64 being in the troops and...
00:31:52.64 --> 00:31:55.64 and stuff, and you're rolling around as a team.
00:31:55.64 --> 00:31:57.64 I thought that that was really cool.
00:31:57.64 --> 00:31:59.64 Um...
00:31:59.64 --> 00:32:03.64 Was there anything that was more challenging?
00:32:03.64 --> 00:32:06.64 Like, you know, some new guys they have a hard time in their first platoon,
00:32:06.64 --> 00:32:09.64 whatever, with land warfare, they have a hard time with CQC,
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:10.64 they'll have a hard time with...
00:32:10.64 --> 00:32:11.64 you know, whatever.
00:32:11.64 --> 00:32:13.64 Sometimes it's like not easy.
00:32:13.64 --> 00:32:16.64 Sometimes, you know, you get a guy that can't dive very well.
00:32:16.64 --> 00:32:17.64 Or whatever.
00:32:17.64 --> 00:32:20.64 Was there anything that was any skill set that was hard for you?
00:32:20.64 --> 00:32:21.64 Or did you pretty much...
00:32:21.64 --> 00:32:22.64 Which is...
00:32:22.64 --> 00:32:25.64 I would say, most guys coming out of buds and SQT,
00:32:25.64 --> 00:32:27.64 like most of them are fine.
00:32:27.64 --> 00:32:28.64 Like most of them get...
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:30.64 They pick things up pretty quick.
00:32:30.64 --> 00:32:32.64 You know, they made it through all that crap.
00:32:32.64 --> 00:32:35.64 They made it through SQT where you're getting
00:32:35.64 --> 00:32:37.64 screened, right?
00:32:37.64 --> 00:32:40.64 Again, some of the most that I'm but still you'd still get guys
00:32:40.64 --> 00:32:43.64 showing up a platoon that, you know, they wouldn't be comfortable with this,
00:32:43.64 --> 00:32:44.64 or they wouldn't be graded at that.
00:32:44.64 --> 00:32:46.64 Was there anything that was tough for you?
00:32:46.64 --> 00:32:51.64 Uh, I would say, like everything was tough.
00:32:51.64 --> 00:32:52.64 I...
00:32:52.64 --> 00:32:57.64 I wasn't a master at anything other than my pig, you know.
00:32:57.64 --> 00:32:58.64 And...
00:32:58.64 --> 00:33:00.64 So everything was...
00:33:00.64 --> 00:33:02.64 Was somewhat challenging for me,
00:33:02.64 --> 00:33:06.64 but I also didn't really struggle with anything too much
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:08.64 other than like my maturity.
00:33:08.64 --> 00:33:10.64 Like that, you know, I was...
00:33:10.64 --> 00:33:14.64 I checked into a seal team before I could even go into a bar.
00:33:14.64 --> 00:33:16.64 You know, and...
00:33:16.64 --> 00:33:18.64 I didn't go to college or anything like that.
00:33:18.64 --> 00:33:19.64 So...
00:33:19.64 --> 00:33:20.64 I was...
00:33:20.64 --> 00:33:23.64 I was a 20 year old in a seal team.
00:33:23.64 --> 00:33:24.64 Yeah.
00:33:24.64 --> 00:33:25.64 You know.
00:33:25.64 --> 00:33:26.64 Um...
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:27.64 So...
00:33:27.64 --> 00:33:31.64 Yes, I had been through a lot as far as like buds
00:33:31.64 --> 00:33:36.64 and SQT and, you know, that kind of forces you to grow up
00:33:36.64 --> 00:33:38.64 to an extent.
00:33:38.64 --> 00:33:41.64 But seals like to party too.
00:33:41.64 --> 00:33:42.64 And...
00:33:42.64 --> 00:33:43.64 And I kind of...
00:33:43.64 --> 00:33:45.64 That was probably my biggest challenge,
00:33:45.64 --> 00:33:48.64 was just my maturity and just kind of...
00:33:48.64 --> 00:33:50.64 learning when to...
00:33:50.64 --> 00:33:53.64 to lock on and...
00:33:53.64 --> 00:33:56.64 And, you know, when it was time to like...
00:33:56.64 --> 00:33:57.64 chill out.
00:33:57.64 --> 00:33:58.64 Did you ever get caught?
00:33:58.64 --> 00:33:59.64 Did you ever get in trouble?
00:33:59.64 --> 00:34:00.64 Did you ever get arrested?
00:34:00.64 --> 00:34:01.64 I did.
00:34:01.64 --> 00:34:02.64 I did get arrested and...
00:34:02.64 --> 00:34:03.64 Not in my new guy, Platoon.
00:34:03.64 --> 00:34:05.64 I got arrested in my...
00:34:05.64 --> 00:34:08.64 And when I was in my second Platoon.
00:34:08.64 --> 00:34:11.64 I got into a bar fight.
00:34:11.64 --> 00:34:12.64 Um...
00:34:12.64 --> 00:34:13.64 These guys...
00:34:13.64 --> 00:34:14.64 It was actually three...
00:34:14.64 --> 00:34:17.64 Three dudes had just started...
00:34:17.64 --> 00:34:19.64 mouth and mouth to one of my...
00:34:19.64 --> 00:34:20.64 Platoon members.
00:34:20.64 --> 00:34:21.64 wife.
00:34:21.64 --> 00:34:25.64 It was him and I and my girlfriend at the time.
00:34:25.64 --> 00:34:27.64 And his girlfriend at the time.
00:34:27.64 --> 00:34:30.64 Now we're wife and...
00:34:30.64 --> 00:34:32.64 We're coming out of the bar and they just...
00:34:32.64 --> 00:34:37.64 I had had a couple of drinks and they had come over and said some disrespectful shit to them.
00:34:37.64 --> 00:34:37.64 And...
00:34:37.64 --> 00:34:38.64 You know, I...
00:34:38.64 --> 00:34:39.64 I just...
00:34:39.64 --> 00:34:41.64 Was feeling froggy a little bit.
00:34:41.64 --> 00:34:42.64 And...
00:34:42.64 --> 00:34:44.64 Didn't let it slide.
00:34:44.64 --> 00:34:45.64 And...
00:34:45.64 --> 00:34:46.64 And it up...
00:34:46.64 --> 00:34:50.64 Wip in their ass and beat up three people outside of a bar and got arrested.
00:34:50.64 --> 00:34:51.64 Mm-hmm.
00:34:51.64 --> 00:34:52.64 But your first position you...
00:34:52.64 --> 00:34:54.64 You managed to keep your nose clean.
00:34:54.64 --> 00:34:55.64 Yeah.
00:34:55.64 --> 00:34:57.64 As far as the actual log out...
00:34:57.64 --> 00:34:59.64 The actual law enforcement goes.
00:34:59.64 --> 00:35:00.64 Yeah.
00:35:00.64 --> 00:35:01.64 I know.
00:35:01.64 --> 00:35:02.64 And then where was that?
00:35:02.64 --> 00:35:03.64 So you did your work up.
00:35:03.64 --> 00:35:05.64 Where did you guys go on deployment to?
00:35:05.64 --> 00:35:06.64 Your first deployment?
00:35:06.64 --> 00:35:07.64 Afghanistan.
00:35:07.64 --> 00:35:11.64 And when you were going to Afghanistan...
00:35:11.64 --> 00:35:13.64 Where you going...
00:35:13.64 --> 00:35:15.64 Did you go as a whole troop to Afghanistan?
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:16.64 Uh...
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:16.64 Yep.
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:17.64 Yeah.
00:35:17.64 --> 00:35:18.64 All three of our...
00:35:18.64 --> 00:35:19.64 Platoon's went.
00:35:19.64 --> 00:35:20.64 Yeah.
00:35:20.64 --> 00:35:20.64 It was...
00:35:20.64 --> 00:35:22.64 It was kind of an interesting...
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:32.24 thing because it was in 2011 and I don't know if you said you got out in 2010.
00:35:32.24 --> 00:35:33.24 I did, yeah.
00:35:33.24 --> 00:35:41.24 Well, yeah, I'm sure you heard about the, they wanted us to somehow get on the army
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:50.80 schedule and so it was us and team 7 and we ended up basically doing two deployments back
00:35:50.80 --> 00:35:56.40 to back and got synced up with the army or something like that.
00:35:56.40 --> 00:36:05.24 I don't know all the, you know, mumbo jumbo that actually took place but or why we did
00:36:05.24 --> 00:36:10.40 it but they told us kind of right before it was like two months before we left.
00:36:10.40 --> 00:36:14.68 They were like, hey, just kidding you guys are going to go to Afghanistan and we're going
00:36:14.68 --> 00:36:21.68 to need you to stay there for basically a year.
00:36:21.68 --> 00:36:34.44 We went there and it was an interesting deployment for sure because my platoon, we were
00:36:34.44 --> 00:36:43.40 the furthest outpost from any major base in Afghanistan and you know, we're basically
00:36:43.40 --> 00:36:45.56 rough in it the whole time we were out there.
00:36:45.56 --> 00:36:49.80 Did you guys take over an outpost somewhere or did you guys establish one?
00:36:49.80 --> 00:36:55.20 We took one over that had just been established like literally a couple months ago.
00:36:55.20 --> 00:36:57.40 You know, so there was, there was nothing there.
00:36:57.40 --> 00:37:03.80 We were sleeping in tents still, no running water, no, nothing like that.
00:37:03.80 --> 00:37:13.20 And then I think around month 7 or 8 of our deployment, we packed up and went 15
00:37:13.20 --> 00:37:17.92 miles north and set up a new site.
00:37:17.92 --> 00:37:24.92 So it was literally just fucking rough in it the whole time, you know, air drop in our
00:37:24.92 --> 00:37:29.68 food in and no running water the whole time.
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:33.88 And what what type of ops were you doing?
00:37:33.88 --> 00:37:39.64 We were we were doing all kinds of stuff and I was lucky enough to kind of, we got to,
00:37:39.64 --> 00:37:41.24 they shifted our guys around too.
00:37:41.24 --> 00:37:46.64 So like we got to all kind of experience different things because we all had a different
00:37:46.64 --> 00:37:52.28 kind of mission set and different, we were all all three of our platoon were in different
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:54.12 areas of Afghanistan.
00:37:54.12 --> 00:37:58.84 So I got to kind of do a lot of everything.
00:37:58.84 --> 00:38:02.92 So were you guys going out on patrol from your, from your forward operating base?
00:38:02.92 --> 00:38:06.60 Was that yeah and pretty much daily?
00:38:06.60 --> 00:38:09.88 And you were interacting with a local populist type thing?
00:38:09.88 --> 00:38:10.88 Yep, yeah.
00:38:10.88 --> 00:38:12.48 Trying to establish relationships.
00:38:12.48 --> 00:38:19.88 Yep, we did that for a little while that was a really dumb.
00:38:19.88 --> 00:38:24.56 That you didn't because you didn't feel like you made any progress, didn't make any connections.
00:38:24.56 --> 00:38:30.96 Yeah, I mean in my opinion, I just thought it was like kind of a waste of time.
00:38:30.96 --> 00:38:37.96 And I just, I just felt like we could have been doing a lot more stuff or better stuff
00:38:37.96 --> 00:38:40.68 for their time and training and all that.
00:38:40.68 --> 00:38:48.32 And it was just like a super dangerous area to be in, you know, it was in Helman.
00:38:48.32 --> 00:38:52.64 And we basically just lived in a fucking minefield, you know.
00:38:52.64 --> 00:38:57.96 And it was just IEDs everywhere, just as a constant threat.
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:05.12 So, you know, and we were going on these long patrols every day and all these, all these
00:39:05.12 --> 00:39:12.44 stops we were doing and hitting these villages that were just riddled with IEDs everywhere
00:39:12.44 --> 00:39:18.60 and, you know, getting contacted, you know, you're basically just stick out like a sore
00:39:18.60 --> 00:39:20.48 thumb there, you know.
00:39:20.48 --> 00:39:24.72 So, I mean, you know how it is overseas.
00:39:24.72 --> 00:39:28.32 I didn't feel real comfortable with that.
00:39:28.32 --> 00:39:34.36 Like, and it sucked, being in a minefield, like just every step, just please don't blow,
00:39:34.36 --> 00:39:36.64 please don't blow, please don't blow up, please don't blow up.
00:39:36.64 --> 00:39:38.44 Yeah, for a year.
00:39:38.44 --> 00:39:39.44 Yeah.
00:39:39.44 --> 00:39:41.36 Did you guys, did you guys hit any IEDs?
00:39:41.36 --> 00:39:42.36 Uh, yeah.
00:39:42.36 --> 00:39:53.48 Yeah, we encountered a couple IEDs and, um, so, I don't know, shitty.
00:39:53.48 --> 00:40:03.32 And the enemy, did you have a feel for who was bad and who was good when you'd go out?
00:40:03.32 --> 00:40:05.80 No, definitely not.
00:40:05.80 --> 00:40:11.16 There was, I mean, because like literally there was, there was times where, you know,
00:40:11.16 --> 00:40:16.92 we'd be in the village, fucking shaking hands with people and then, you know, on the way
00:40:16.92 --> 00:40:23.32 out, get contacted, getting a firefight, and then fucking go back and look and, oh, it's
00:40:23.32 --> 00:40:28.76 the same guys that we were just shaking hands with that, or fucking dead, you know.
00:40:28.76 --> 00:40:42.28 So it was hard to, it was really weird to like get ramped up and everything as these,
00:40:42.28 --> 00:40:48.24 like, you get in this mindset, this warrior mindset, you know, that you're going to war
00:40:48.24 --> 00:40:54.38 and you're going to this fucking land where everyone is, you know, your enemy and bubble
00:40:54.38 --> 00:40:59.66 blah and then it's like, oh, just kidding, let's try to help some of these people or whatever.
00:40:59.66 --> 00:41:05.10 And the, you know, the good and use like, okay, yeah, I want to, I want to help people
00:41:05.10 --> 00:41:12.46 and stuff like that and, and do what I can, um, to help these people out and, and if they're
00:41:12.46 --> 00:41:17.58 getting like bully, essentially by the, by the Taliban or whatever, like, that's not cool,
00:41:17.58 --> 00:41:28.22 but I just felt like it was, it was really weird to be there and go there with that mindset
00:41:28.22 --> 00:41:31.50 and then have to fucking like try to help people and then when you try to help people, they
00:41:31.50 --> 00:41:36.70 don't want your help and, you know, and they fucking shoot at you and, and shit like that.
00:41:36.70 --> 00:41:42.62 So it's like, and then you're expected to like go out and try and help these people again.
00:41:42.62 --> 00:41:49.34 And it's, I don't know, it was just like a weird, so weird dynamic.
00:41:49.34 --> 00:41:53.18 And would you go, when you said you would move positions, where you go in from like, would
00:41:53.18 --> 00:41:56.62 you like switch platoons and go to a different operating base?
00:41:56.62 --> 00:41:57.62 Yeah.
00:41:57.62 --> 00:42:03.34 And then you'd spend some time there with them and then do operations with them and then
00:42:03.34 --> 00:42:05.62 after a little while go to a different one as well.
00:42:05.62 --> 00:42:12.34 Yeah, yeah, we, we rotated our guy, all of our guys just to, so we can all get, you know,
00:42:12.34 --> 00:42:19.46 experience doing other things like working with the commandos or, you know, training the fit,
00:42:19.46 --> 00:42:23.30 training the fit or doing the VSO stuff.
00:42:23.30 --> 00:42:26.02 And yeah, it was cool.
00:42:26.02 --> 00:42:32.26 I enjoyed that just because it broke up the monotony of every day, you know, going on patrols,
00:42:32.26 --> 00:42:37.30 doing the same thing, seeing the same places or whatever and dealing with the same threats.
00:42:37.30 --> 00:42:43.06 It just, it keeps you kind of from getting complacent.
00:42:43.06 --> 00:42:47.06 I felt like, so I was especially for the 11 month or yeah.
00:42:47.06 --> 00:42:52.42 So I was definitely happy to move and do new things and work.
00:42:52.42 --> 00:42:58.50 And like, and it was cool, too, because on the base that we were at in Afghanistan, it was literally
00:42:58.50 --> 00:43:00.90 like 100 yards by 100 yards.
00:43:01.78 --> 00:43:04.82 That was, that was like, our camp.
00:43:04.82 --> 00:43:07.38 It was like being imprisoned, you know, but worse.
00:43:07.38 --> 00:43:10.02 And like, because we're getting shot at, too.
00:43:10.02 --> 00:43:16.82 And like, if you, when you go outside to go get your fucking food that they air drop in,
00:43:17.62 --> 00:43:22.58 you know, you're worried about stepping on IDs, like we found ID's literally right outside of
00:43:22.58 --> 00:43:24.26 our compound, you know.
00:43:24.26 --> 00:43:26.66 So it was constant threat always.
00:43:26.66 --> 00:43:33.14 And, uh, and like I said, like going to get our air drop, it was just a lot of work, too,
00:43:33.14 --> 00:43:39.22 because not only it was like we were sealed bees, you know, we had to like build our,
00:43:39.22 --> 00:43:44.66 we had to like build our camp and also like all the stuff that came with that, like,
00:43:45.46 --> 00:43:51.06 going and getting our, our supplies that would air drop in and, and being out there,
00:43:51.78 --> 00:43:56.90 you know, you only get ring routes and stuff, you only get air drops every once in a while.
00:43:56.90 --> 00:44:04.26 And, uh, so when, when shit would come in, it was like all hands go work on this and then
00:44:04.26 --> 00:44:09.22 also you got a prep your shit and get ready for the, the op tonight or tomorrow or whatever.
00:44:09.22 --> 00:44:18.98 And, um, and I remember just, I have a video of one of our big air drops coming in
00:44:18.98 --> 00:44:24.02 and, uh, you just see like three or four palettes just burn in and just explode.
00:44:24.02 --> 00:44:30.02 And, you know, it's like always, like all the water bottle palettes are fine,
00:44:30.02 --> 00:44:35.70 but it's that one with like the goodies, you know, it's like, oh man, you know, that's the one
00:44:35.70 --> 00:44:40.50 that burned in and it just fucking hits the ground explodes and you see like all the rippets or
00:44:41.14 --> 00:44:45.38 something, you know, something that people are looking forward to just explode and you're like,
00:44:45.38 --> 00:44:52.74 fuck. I don't know, I just accepted that. This is my life. So whatever, I wasn't, I wasn't thinking
00:44:52.74 --> 00:45:00.26 about the time too much and then, um, I just, you get into a rhythm, you know, and we got to,
00:45:00.26 --> 00:45:04.18 we got to go home for R&R, that was cool. Took a little break, but it was like,
00:45:04.18 --> 00:45:09.46 bittersweet, you know, go home for fucking two weeks and like, oh, I've just been playing in this
00:45:09.46 --> 00:45:13.62 mine field where everyone's trying to kill me for the last six months and come home for two
00:45:13.62 --> 00:45:18.98 weeks and like to normal see and you're just like, you know, literally just fly straight from there,
00:45:18.98 --> 00:45:24.50 know decompression or anything and then now you're back in normal society with your family and
00:45:24.50 --> 00:45:30.18 by the way, you're leaving in 11 days to go back. Yeah, and then don't get comfortable because
00:45:30.18 --> 00:45:36.42 we're going right back over there. So that was like kind of like, it was bittersweet and uh,
00:45:36.82 --> 00:45:40.74 got back over there, but that was cool too because it was like, all right, I'm fucking halfway through
00:45:40.74 --> 00:45:47.70 like, it's downhill now, you know, so that it kind of definitely fired me up to finish out, but then
00:45:47.70 --> 00:45:54.34 uh, towards the end and we were there for all four seasons. So we saw literally all four seasons.
00:45:54.34 --> 00:46:04.10 It was interesting. And um, by the end of it, by the end of it, uh, I remember when the ring
00:46:04.10 --> 00:46:12.26 route came to pick me up to go out, uh, I remember flying away from from the base that we were at
00:46:12.26 --> 00:46:17.46 and just thinking like, I felt kind of sad, like like almost like when you move away from
00:46:17.46 --> 00:46:22.10 somewhere and like I've moved my whole life, I moved around a lot. So I was like, damn, like this
00:46:22.10 --> 00:46:30.26 has been my home for the last year, you know, I'm kind of bummed to to to leave, but fuck this place.
00:46:30.26 --> 00:46:35.94 I can't wait to go home. Yeah, I got kind of lucky because I had been in the navy for a while
00:46:35.94 --> 00:46:40.42 when when I deployed to Iraq and especially my second deployment to Iraq, where I was in
00:46:40.42 --> 00:46:47.86 Ramaday and and like I, I, you know, sometimes people say, oh, I look back and I wish I would have
00:46:48.50 --> 00:46:52.82 appreciated it more. You know, people say that about certain parts of their life,
00:46:53.46 --> 00:46:58.66 I don't have that at all. Like I 100% appreciated every single day I was there. I was like, this is,
00:46:58.66 --> 00:47:03.54 this is the best part of my whole life is right. It's what's happening today right now.
00:47:03.54 --> 00:47:08.58 You know, so I got kind of lucky in the fact that, you know, even talking to the guys that were
00:47:08.58 --> 00:47:16.26 new guys on that deployment to a body, they, they just kind of, they were like, from then on,
00:47:16.26 --> 00:47:20.10 they be saying, damn, you know, I thought that's what every deployment was going to be like. It was,
00:47:20.10 --> 00:47:27.22 and it was, they just didn't have that same perspective of, hey, man, this is like this target
00:47:27.22 --> 00:47:32.02 rich environment where we're getting to do what everyone's dreamed of doing their whole life.
00:47:32.02 --> 00:47:37.22 And you're going to do it all the time. That doesn't happen, you know, it doesn't happen like that
00:47:37.22 --> 00:47:42.74 usually, you know, and it's hard. And so I was pretty lucky in the fact that I, I, I was,
00:47:42.74 --> 00:47:48.26 I could appreciate it. Yeah. I know, as far as the work went, like I was as far as like, like,
00:47:48.98 --> 00:47:54.50 being a seal and working there, like that, that was awesome, you know, and I was, you know,
00:47:54.50 --> 00:48:01.94 one of the biggest, like, I say concerns I had or not are even not concerned was just like a
00:48:01.94 --> 00:48:09.62 question to myself was, you know, what, what, how am I actually going to react and combat,
00:48:09.62 --> 00:48:15.30 you know, I mean, because everyone likes to think that they're ideally, you know, in a situation
00:48:15.30 --> 00:48:20.66 of shit popped off, you know, I'll be the, I'll be the guy who will, you know, hold my,
00:48:20.66 --> 00:48:25.38 have my shit together and and be that, you know, the rock or whatever, you know, I mean,
00:48:25.38 --> 00:48:34.26 and some people crumble, you know, and I saw that as a seal, like that, that was kind of my,
00:48:34.26 --> 00:48:39.22 I was always a realist, you know, was like, I've never been shot at. I've never been in a gunfight
00:48:39.22 --> 00:48:46.50 or whatever. So, I definitely, you know, I, I, I, I feel like I'm not a coward and I feel like I would
00:48:46.50 --> 00:48:53.14 step up and do, do what I got to do and perform. I feel like that, but I don't know it for sure,
00:48:53.14 --> 00:49:00.74 you know what I mean. And so that was, that was definitely when it happened and I, you know,
00:49:00.74 --> 00:49:09.46 and I did, I, I stepped up and, and felt very pleased with how that all went down and, and all the combat
00:49:09.46 --> 00:49:16.90 and everything that I had been involved with, like, that was definitely, um, rewarding to me, you know,
00:49:16.90 --> 00:49:23.86 like as a seal and, and as a man, just, and as a warrior, just like, okay, like, I felt legit, you know,
00:49:23.86 --> 00:49:33.62 I felt like fulfilled in that sense. So the work, the work was really good, but just as far as
00:49:34.34 --> 00:49:42.58 being in that environment, like, the IEDs was really like, the IEDs and the fucking like
00:49:42.58 --> 00:49:51.54 invisible enemy was kind of, um, discouraging, you know. It was like, I felt like we just had so much
00:49:52.74 --> 00:49:59.86 risk, you know, for not a whole lot of reward. And like, which is different, like I would say,
00:49:59.86 --> 00:50:05.38 or I feel like in like, Ramadi, it was like a different, just way different environment,
00:50:05.38 --> 00:50:13.46 um, but yeah. Yeah, no, that's, that's the, that's the way in surgeons are supposed to fight,
00:50:13.46 --> 00:50:17.06 right? You're not supposed to see them. They're just supposed to pick away at you the death of a
00:50:17.06 --> 00:50:23.30 thousand cuts, you know, indirect fire, IEDs and snipers, and they don't want you to ever see them,
00:50:23.30 --> 00:50:27.54 and, and that's what they want, and just to slowly pick away because they don't care about
00:50:27.54 --> 00:50:32.74 human life, they don't value human life, and here we are, you know, every time we lose someone,
00:50:32.74 --> 00:50:38.18 it's, it's a tragedy, and they don't care if they lose guys or not, they don't care. They don't care
00:50:38.18 --> 00:50:42.82 if civilians get killed, don't care about any of that. And so that's why they have, that's why
00:50:42.82 --> 00:50:49.06 they have an advantage in those situations, a psychological advantage is, hey, we, we don't care
00:50:49.06 --> 00:50:53.54 if you kill us, and by the way, we know you care about your people, and so we're going to pick
00:50:53.54 --> 00:50:57.38 away, and you're, hopefully you're never going to see us, and we don't care, we're going to blow
00:50:57.38 --> 00:51:04.66 you up, and we don't care. Yeah, that, I mean, that was pretty apparent, I mean, because a lot of the
00:51:04.66 --> 00:51:10.42 IEDs that went off were, you know, local villagers stepping on. Yeah, I'm triggered by civilians,
00:51:10.42 --> 00:51:19.30 and, and that, that just happened all the, all of the day I'm time, and, and we would, we would,
00:51:19.30 --> 00:51:23.86 you know, we would, we would aid the wounded and stuff like that, and they would like get pissed
00:51:23.86 --> 00:51:28.50 at us, and we're like, we didn't plant that shit, you know? Like, keep mad at them, not us.
00:51:29.30 --> 00:51:35.86 Yeah, that, that, that insurgency thing is, but yeah, and like, you know, it was, it was just super
00:51:35.86 --> 00:51:47.14 frustrating to me, like, it was super frustrating to me, dealing with like the politics involved
00:51:47.14 --> 00:51:57.30 with war, and, you know, I felt like we absolutely could have done things to give us more of
00:51:57.30 --> 00:52:03.46 an advantage, but it seemed like they were more concerned with politics and shit like that,
00:52:04.34 --> 00:52:12.74 you know, as more than more than like the safety of us, and I just felt like we could, you know,
00:52:12.74 --> 00:52:19.46 there's no reason why we should be going out in the daylight period, you know, we train, like,
00:52:19.46 --> 00:52:24.74 why not fight like we train, and, oh, because you guys got locked down from doing stuff at night, right?
00:52:24.74 --> 00:52:31.14 Oh, we got to do night shit, but we also did a lot of day shit, and, you know, to me, it was just,
00:52:31.14 --> 00:52:35.86 like, why the fuck are we doing this? Like, we have night vision, why are we going out there?
00:52:35.86 --> 00:52:44.34 Did you have Afghan forces with you? Sometimes. Mm-hmm. A lot of times we did. Well, uh, we,
00:52:44.34 --> 00:52:49.14 we had to work a lot in Ramadi in the daytime, um, and the main reason why we worked,
00:52:49.14 --> 00:52:51.86 well, there's a couple of big reasons why we're working the daytime in Ramadi,
00:52:52.42 --> 00:52:57.46 which as you, as you just pointed out, is a huge tactical disadvantage compared to being out at
00:52:57.46 --> 00:53:02.26 night where we can literally see in the enemy camps, I mean, it's, but in Ramadi, you know,
00:53:02.26 --> 00:53:06.82 we had to work with Iraqi soldiers who didn't have night vision. So, they didn't have flashlights.
00:53:06.82 --> 00:53:10.42 They would have like one flashlight for every four people, and we'd eventually got them flashlights
00:53:10.42 --> 00:53:17.22 and stuff, but anyways, it was, it was a problem because to go out at night with them,
00:53:17.22 --> 00:53:23.54 it was, they were blind. And so now, you're like, at a, you're at the same disadvantage,
00:53:24.18 --> 00:53:27.78 because you're trying to, you got people that can't see, mixed with people that can't see,
00:53:27.78 --> 00:53:32.02 and they're not getting anything out of it. They're not improving their skills at all.
00:53:32.02 --> 00:53:33.54 And they're just horrible.
00:53:34.10 --> 00:53:39.62 Yeah, and they were, they were not, not good, not good. And so that was one reason was to take
00:53:39.62 --> 00:53:43.38 them out in the daytime, to, to get them to operate, we had to go out with them in the daytime.
00:53:43.38 --> 00:53:48.10 And the other big one was the enemy knew that we owned the night. And so the enemy in Ramadi,
00:53:48.10 --> 00:53:52.10 they didn't come out at night, they came out in the daytime. So if you wanted to kill them,
00:53:52.10 --> 00:53:56.98 you had to go out when they were, when they were moving. And so that's when we're now, and, you know,
00:53:56.98 --> 00:54:01.62 we did both, and we did a ton of the night as well. And also, you know, we take advantage of the night
00:54:01.62 --> 00:54:07.06 to get in good positions, you know, when, and then during the daytime, they would come out to fight,
00:54:07.06 --> 00:54:14.66 and, you know, they'd get it. Yeah, we had, we had, we were working with the commandos, and they had
00:54:14.66 --> 00:54:22.10 night vision, but like I said, they were just terrible. And like, one of them almost shot me
00:54:22.10 --> 00:54:32.58 on an op, we were actually in a helicopter flying to Target. And it was one of their heavy gunners.
00:54:32.58 --> 00:54:43.46 And he, it was around midnight, and we were flying in a shenook to the target. And I was just kind
00:54:43.46 --> 00:54:50.50 of nodding off, just, you know, just trying to, you know, catch a little nap on the ride to the op,
00:54:50.50 --> 00:54:55.54 and it's pitch black, and the, and the hellow, obviously, and all of a sudden it's just,
00:54:56.98 --> 00:55:03.46 you know, like four or five rounds crack off. And the guy next, it was the guy next to me, and
00:55:03.46 --> 00:55:10.66 think God, he had his barrel down. And like, literally just shot like four or five rounds, like
00:55:10.66 --> 00:55:16.34 less than six inches from my feet. And there's just holes in the bottom of the, the bird, and
00:55:16.34 --> 00:55:23.78 shot the comms out of the hellow and everything. And at that point, I was just like, you know,
00:55:23.78 --> 00:55:30.10 I was, there's just kind of a used dish it, being shitty, and just reached over and took the rounds
00:55:30.10 --> 00:55:35.94 out of his gun and just, that was it. And just like, come over, it comes like, yeah, the fucking
00:55:35.94 --> 00:55:44.18 commandos, 80, you know, never, just like whatever. But so then we changed, like, all right,
00:55:44.18 --> 00:55:50.74 no more commandos rolling hot in the birds, you know, on the way to target target. And so we,
00:55:50.74 --> 00:56:01.22 we had changed that. So then the next one we did, we fucking got to, we got to our, our, our
00:56:02.02 --> 00:56:09.38 target bird landed, get out and do our formation. And also, and it's like a total brownout, you know,
00:56:09.38 --> 00:56:15.86 because the Afghanistan is super dusty and everything there. And the, the hellow lands where I'll
00:56:15.86 --> 00:56:22.26 get now in our formation and total brownout. And then all of a sudden, we hear fucking rounds going off.
00:56:22.26 --> 00:56:29.86 Because the, the dudes loading their pigs, like all of a sudden had to run away gun or whatever,
00:56:29.86 --> 00:56:34.66 where we don't know if we're getting contact it, like you can hear it's outgoing, but like why?
00:56:34.66 --> 00:56:39.54 Why is their outgoing fire when we're in filling? You know, are we getting contact or what's
00:56:39.54 --> 00:56:46.10 going on? And it's just these guys are fucking stupid with their weapons. And yeah, so that was always,
00:56:46.10 --> 00:56:53.94 always something fun. Always good. So you wrap up that deployment and come back to
00:56:55.06 --> 00:57:01.30 come back and roll into your next, next, but there. Yeah, come back and roll into the next
00:57:01.30 --> 00:57:06.34 button and I always wanted to. How was that? How was that coming home? Now you're, now you're home.
00:57:06.34 --> 00:57:09.54 You did the two weeks in the middle. How was the transition when you got home?
00:57:11.14 --> 00:57:20.42 It was, it was, it was rough. I was definitely dealing with some PTSD, I would say. And
00:57:20.42 --> 00:57:33.62 I was, I was definitely kind of angry. I was, I was angry. It was weird, weird emotions.
00:57:34.34 --> 00:57:43.30 Because I, I kind of was kind of pissed off at like, America, like, like, not America as a whole,
00:57:43.30 --> 00:57:50.50 but like, I felt like the politics, you know, like I said earlier, I felt like they really
00:57:52.74 --> 00:57:58.98 cared more about, or they just didn't really give a shit about our safety. I felt like, you know,
00:57:59.38 --> 00:58:06.98 it's one thing, like obviously we're doing a dangerous job. But why, why on earth are we not giving
00:58:06.98 --> 00:58:14.98 ourselves every advantage that we are capable of, you know, like the night vision and stuff like that?
00:58:14.98 --> 00:58:25.22 And a lot of times we would capture people who we knew were bad, you know, talking to our
00:58:25.22 --> 00:58:32.02 Intel guys and they're like 100% like this dude is a fucking terrorist. Like he's a bad dude. Like
00:58:32.02 --> 00:58:38.18 everyone in his phone, you know, they rip apart their shit and like every one of his contacts are bad,
00:58:38.18 --> 00:58:47.62 you know, like this guy's definitely an IED maker, you know, whatever. And so we've got these guys
00:58:47.62 --> 00:58:53.38 captured, but then we have to turn him into the Afghan government, which we also know is corrupt.
00:58:53.38 --> 00:59:02.74 And then all of a sudden these dudes are out on the streets again in a couple months time and
00:59:02.74 --> 00:59:10.02 making IEDs that, you know, me or my brothers could step on and fucking, that's a wrap. And,
00:59:12.02 --> 00:59:19.30 you know, Caleb Nelson was a seal that died on our deployment from our team. And
00:59:19.30 --> 00:59:30.34 it's just kind of, you know, life and death and war just puts things in a perspective. And
00:59:30.34 --> 00:59:38.18 it really made me angry that, you know, like Caleb couldn't come home because of an IED and like
00:59:39.46 --> 00:59:45.30 we're letting these people go. And I just felt like we weren't being
00:59:45.30 --> 00:59:54.34 utilized fully and like, like it was costing us. And so I was like really angry about that.
00:59:56.98 --> 01:00:02.42 And then also just kind of being in that environment for a long time, just
01:00:03.78 --> 01:00:10.50 different, you know, different mentality and then coming home to America and like people just
01:00:10.50 --> 01:00:16.26 don't understand how good it is here and it's like a fucking fairy tale, you know. And
01:00:17.22 --> 01:00:24.42 trying and listening to people talk and complaining about, about shit here. And I'm just like,
01:00:25.38 --> 01:00:30.02 you don't even have to, you don't even, you just walked down that sidewalk and didn't even give
01:00:30.02 --> 01:00:35.62 a fuck where you stepped. Like you're doing even care because you're not worried about anything.
01:00:35.62 --> 01:00:40.18 You're not worried if there's an IED there. Like you have running water. You took a shower today.
01:00:41.14 --> 01:00:50.18 You fucking, I had to burn my own shit, you know. So I was just like a lot of anger,
01:00:50.66 --> 01:00:57.86 you know, with that. And I was drinking a lot like, uh, and I also felt like I felt like
01:00:57.86 --> 01:01:04.42 seals where the only ones that kind of understood and got it. And then also being over there
01:01:04.42 --> 01:01:12.26 and I've gained a stand I saw, you know, can to heart, the main base and can to heart was like a
01:01:12.26 --> 01:01:18.90 fucking, it was like a little town, you know. And there's like, flag football leagues and shopping
01:01:18.90 --> 01:01:24.66 and TGI Fridays, people have birthday parties and shit like that. And you know, that's where,
01:01:24.66 --> 01:01:29.62 that's where like Tim McGrath lies in to do the concert for the troops and shit like that, you know.
01:01:29.62 --> 01:01:34.18 And it's like, uh, is this where we're staying, eating like kings, you know, and they're like, no,
01:01:34.18 --> 01:01:42.58 no, no, you're going out there. So then, you know, that's where I was and that's where, where me and my
01:01:42.58 --> 01:01:51.30 boys were, you know, living in the sock and doing some serious fucking shitty living, you know.
01:01:51.30 --> 01:02:00.18 And, and, and working a job that was dangerous as fuck every day. And then just seeing that kind of shit,
01:02:00.18 --> 01:02:08.82 like, I don't know, I just, I felt like before I had gone over overseas, I was like real,
01:02:10.18 --> 01:02:15.22 like, thank you for your service to everyone I saw, you know, and, and afterwards, I was just kind of the
01:02:15.22 --> 01:02:24.34 opposite. And, uh, it was like fuck all these motherfuckers in the end. So I was just disgruntled in whatever.
01:02:24.34 --> 01:02:31.46 And, uh, and, you know, I'd hear people talk about PTSD or this or that and I'm like,
01:02:32.74 --> 01:02:37.54 what the fuck are you? What are you afraid of? You know, you were on a main base that like,
01:02:37.54 --> 01:02:45.38 it wasn't, it's not even that thing, like you didn't experience war. But that was like just kind of
01:02:45.38 --> 01:02:51.86 immaturity at the time and, and like, like I said, me being just kind of disgruntled and, um,
01:02:53.86 --> 01:03:03.22 dealing with that and I was drinking like heavily, uh, and I was just a super aggressive person.
01:03:03.22 --> 01:03:10.26 And, um, it wasn't like a good, it wasn't good for my friends, a family, like people I cared
01:03:10.26 --> 01:03:15.06 about or whatever. And like I said, I felt like seals were kind of the only ones that understood.
01:03:15.06 --> 01:03:23.94 And then even amongst seals, I felt like only the ones who who had to live so shitty, like we did,
01:03:23.94 --> 01:03:31.06 like our platoon, you know, no running water for a year and like, like, just living in that environment
01:03:31.06 --> 01:03:36.66 was super rough. And I felt like they were the only ones who understood. But then again, it's like,
01:03:36.66 --> 01:03:42.10 I just spent a year with these assholes in a hundred by a hundred foot, you know,
01:03:43.14 --> 01:03:50.42 place, I don't want to see them. And so I just kind of felt alone a little bit, you know, and,
01:03:52.26 --> 01:04:00.90 whatever dealt with that, got, got through that, um, Doom Better Now. And I was
01:04:00.90 --> 01:04:09.94 like kind of disgruntled towards people claiming PTSD and all this kind of shit, uh, for years
01:04:09.94 --> 01:04:18.98 after that. And then actually some random, um, uh, this random chick at a dinner I was at,
01:04:19.70 --> 01:04:26.26 she was, uh, in the army or something like that. And, and she had, she was talking about PTSD.
01:04:26.26 --> 01:04:32.82 And I was just thinking like Jesus Christ, what the fuck are you? What is it, you know, and I kind of
01:04:32.82 --> 01:04:40.50 said my view points on it and she was like, well, you know, fear is relative. And, you know,
01:04:40.50 --> 01:04:47.94 like, you were, you were seriously trained and stuff for, for war and, and to be in that
01:04:47.94 --> 01:04:53.30 environment and, you know, some people weren't. And, like, fear is relative. Like this,
01:04:53.30 --> 01:04:59.46 like being in a gunfight to you, you know, and versus like just being in that country,
01:04:59.46 --> 01:05:05.30 like, could be the same amount of fear or more for that person. And I was just kind of like,
01:05:05.30 --> 01:05:10.66 you know, I never really thought about it that way. Okay, I'll change my mind.
01:05:10.66 --> 01:05:16.02 Yeah, well, war is different for everybody. And it's, I remember my first deployment to Iraq,
01:05:16.02 --> 01:05:22.18 we, we travel a lot and we went to a lot of different places. And so we go from like the incredible
01:05:22.18 --> 01:05:27.54 palaces that have been taken over that had subways and Starbucks. And then we, you know, the next
01:05:27.54 --> 01:05:32.66 day, we'd be out at some outstates and somewhere there'd be an ODA team just living in, you know,
01:05:32.66 --> 01:05:37.46 the most horrible living conditions. And then the next day you'd be with some random
01:05:37.46 --> 01:05:41.62 Marine Corps company out and some other forward-operative based and again, they're just living like
01:05:41.62 --> 01:05:47.70 in hell. And then you come back to another, another like main fob and it's all luxurious and nice.
01:05:47.70 --> 01:05:52.10 And I mean, it just, it kind of is what it is. First, you know, it just kind of is what it is. And that
01:05:52.10 --> 01:05:58.42 actually makes sense with that female set about, you know, hey, it's different people are there.
01:05:58.42 --> 01:06:06.02 They're there for different reasons. You know, like, we joined the seal teams because what we want
01:06:06.02 --> 01:06:12.42 to do is go out and go on patrol with a machine gun. That's like 100% of why you join the
01:06:12.42 --> 01:06:17.62 seal teams. So what I go here, you're hoping for this and five. You're praying for war. Yeah.
01:06:17.62 --> 01:06:26.58 And so I remember like being out there, man, I remember my very first up when I, we flew into
01:06:26.58 --> 01:06:33.46 this to this village and I remember being like super nervous, like holy shit. I'm fucking
01:06:33.46 --> 01:06:38.66 maybe see that I'm actually going on my first mission, like holy shit. And I'm just thinking,
01:06:38.66 --> 01:06:45.70 like, when we land, we landed at like 3 a.m. or something. And we, we offset like way far away.
01:06:46.42 --> 01:06:53.06 But I was thinking like, it's going to be guns blazing as soon as this helo lands. I jump out
01:06:53.06 --> 01:06:58.10 the helo and I'm just like full blown ready for war. Like, what are bringing on? Let's go.
01:06:58.10 --> 01:07:07.46 Where's been lobbing? And it was just pitch black quiet and sat there for fucking hours. And, you
01:07:07.46 --> 01:07:12.98 know, till the sun came up, nothing happened. I was like, God damn it. I saw disappointed, you know?
01:07:12.98 --> 01:07:19.14 Like, I was looking forward to like war. And then, you know, obviously we got, we got plenty.
01:07:19.14 --> 01:07:27.54 But yeah, I remember just being real antsy to, to get in a firefight and, you know, to do
01:07:27.54 --> 01:07:32.26 what I've been trained to do and put my training to the test, you know. And yeah, it's different
01:07:32.26 --> 01:07:38.82 for other people who are not experiences may vary. There's no doubt about that. So when you went to
01:07:38.82 --> 01:07:43.46 bat, when you got home and you got put into a new cartoon, did you guys keep a core group of guys
01:07:43.46 --> 01:07:49.54 from your from your previous cartoon together? Or was it like brand new? No, no, we had guys
01:07:49.54 --> 01:07:55.94 that stayed and, and some went, you know, to trade at some screen and standard turn of the
01:07:55.94 --> 01:07:59.78 day. Yeah, they standard shift. Few, a few core guys stayed together, four or five or whatever.
01:07:59.78 --> 01:08:06.58 And then you guys got a new chief, a new OIC, a new assistant to commander. Yeah, that was
01:08:06.58 --> 01:08:15.38 man, God, thank God. I am so, I so do not miss having fucking 20 bosses, you know, in the military.
01:08:15.38 --> 01:08:21.14 And then every, you know, at the drop of a hat, it can change. And then all of a sudden, it's like,
01:08:21.14 --> 01:08:27.06 nope, new flavor. We're, we're, now we're, you know, it's like, oh, Jaco's now our fucking
01:08:27.06 --> 01:08:32.26 commander. So we're all waking up at 430 and going to PT. It's like, what the fuck, when did this happen?
01:08:32.90 --> 01:08:41.46 This is bullshit. Oh, check. And as you get, you do another work up. Yep. And then, uh, I, uh,
01:08:41.46 --> 01:08:48.26 I'd always wanted to be a dog handler. Yeah, and I, I, I tried to volunteer to be a dog handler as a new guy
01:08:48.26 --> 01:08:54.02 and, and they said, no, you know, they want to, yeah, they want you to, to, here's your dog.
01:08:54.02 --> 01:09:03.94 That's name's 48. And, uh, make it bark. So, yeah, now I got to, um, to do the dog handling thing and,
01:09:05.06 --> 01:09:10.98 with super super excited about that. And, uh, it was, it was honestly such a great time.
01:09:11.86 --> 01:09:20.18 I had a badass dog and I was this first handler. And, uh, yeah, it was, it was super cool because,
01:09:20.18 --> 01:09:29.18 you know, well, one, I was, I was a one-poil-tune wonder. So I'd already kind of gotten that F-gainst
01:09:29.18 --> 01:09:36.90 and gotten some combat under my belt. And, um, you know, I was the classic worst, the worst guy in the
01:09:36.90 --> 01:09:43.14 teams is a one-poil-tune wonder. And, uh, so I was full blown. Just one cruise wonder. You knew everything.
01:09:43.14 --> 01:09:55.14 100%. And, uh, and I got a fucking dog. So watch out. Stelling. My dog was super cool. And, um, they, like, uh,
01:09:55.14 --> 01:10:01.14 there, there were six of us that went over to work with the dogs and we all got along really well.
01:10:01.14 --> 01:10:09.94 And, uh, and that was super cool because now you're not a new guy, finally, you know, and, I mean, even on our
01:10:09.94 --> 01:10:17.94 deployment in Afghanistan, we were still fucking doing new guy shit. You're, you're a new guy.
01:10:17.94 --> 01:10:24.34 You're fucking new guy. I couldn't fucking believe it. I'm like, we literally, they made us
01:10:24.34 --> 01:10:31.54 shovel rocks one time. Like, like a whole, like, uh, dumpster or a dump truck full of rocks.
01:10:31.54 --> 01:10:38.26 And, they just, we just moved it from one pile and just tent over, like, 10, 15 feet to the right.
01:10:38.26 --> 01:10:44.74 And we just moved the pile of rocks to this make a new pile, 15 feet to the right. And it was,
01:10:44.74 --> 01:10:49.14 it was a disciplinary thing. It wasn't, you know, all the new guys. Your, your attitudes
01:10:49.14 --> 01:10:55.86 is not good. And we're just like, are you fucking serious? Like, we were just sort of firefighting with you.
01:10:55.86 --> 01:11:01.22 Like, you know, we're not like, we're expecting to like be boys now. They're like, shut up new guys.
01:11:01.22 --> 01:11:07.06 You're, you're attitude sucks. Go shovel rocks. And we're just like, God, and then, you know,
01:11:07.06 --> 01:11:12.82 we were like literally having to burn shit, you know, burn our own shit. Uh, we had, we had
01:11:13.70 --> 01:11:21.54 barrels that we had wrapped that, that cordon around and cut in half and, um, filled with diesel fuel.
01:11:22.34 --> 01:11:27.86 Those were, those were our, those were our shatters, but they needed burned. So when, uh, when the, when the
01:11:27.86 --> 01:11:35.38 new guys, you know, when, when we didn't, uh, have the best attitudes or, our attitudes weren't up to
01:11:35.38 --> 01:11:42.50 par, we, we shoveled rocks and burned shit. So I was definitely happy to not be a new guy anymore.
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:50.26 Here. Um, but anyway, yeah. So I was a one-pointed one-year had a dog and, uh, got to go through
01:11:50.26 --> 01:11:56.90 another work up with the dog. So that was super cool and, and got to go through dog training school
01:11:56.90 --> 01:12:05.78 and, and learn about the dogs and, and, um, yeah, unfortunately, like right right before, it was,
01:12:05.78 --> 01:12:12.58 we were on like pre-depliment leave and they had told us like, hey, change plans. We're going,
01:12:12.58 --> 01:12:19.30 now we're going to U-com. So, uh, we don't need the dog anymore. Oh, and it was like, fuck man,
01:12:19.30 --> 01:12:23.70 this isn't like a piece of equipment. I mean, that's essentially how the Navy looks at them. They
01:12:23.70 --> 01:12:29.94 are, they are equipment, but, you know, obviously it's a dog and you, you, you form this like
01:12:29.94 --> 01:12:37.14 super strong bond and attachment with them, just like they're your pet. And, uh, my dog was super
01:12:37.14 --> 01:12:44.42 awesome and I'd worked with them so much. You know, it was like a robot. It was like a, uh, it was so cool.
01:12:44.42 --> 01:12:50.74 And, um, I was fucking so pissed off when they just dropped that on us and it's just like, yeah,
01:12:50.74 --> 01:12:59.22 like hand the leash over to someone else. And, yeah, so did that and, uh, then went to U-com and,
01:12:59.22 --> 01:13:06.18 and, you know, a lot of guys were fucking super pissed off that we were going to U-com and, you know,
01:13:06.18 --> 01:13:13.70 I was definitely looking forward to using my dog and, you know, doing that and Afghanistan,
01:13:13.70 --> 01:13:21.62 but, you know, that is what it is. You know, I definitely knew that there wasn't. I didn't see any
01:13:21.62 --> 01:13:27.30 value in just bitching about it. And, uh, it seemed like that was like the common thing was just,
01:13:28.18 --> 01:13:34.58 it seemed almost like if you weren't bitching about it, then you were looked at as a turd. And, like,
01:13:34.58 --> 01:13:40.26 if, you know, if you weren't bitching louder, then the guy next to you, then you're, you know,
01:13:40.26 --> 01:13:44.90 I'm, man, I'm so just point out we're not going to have to get in. Yeah, me too. I'm super disappointed.
01:13:44.90 --> 01:13:50.10 Like, yeah, well, I can't even sleep at night. Well, I don't even want to fucking go, you know,
01:13:50.10 --> 01:13:55.22 like, you know, it's just, yeah, I just realized just to shed some light on to everyone. So,
01:13:55.22 --> 01:14:00.18 when you deploy in a seal battoon or a seal troop, you can deploy different parts of the world.
01:14:00.18 --> 01:14:04.58 Sometimes you deploy to places like Iraq and Afghanistan, which is we just kind of discuss that's
01:14:04.58 --> 01:14:10.26 where everybody wants to go. Well, 95% well, you never know what the real number is. Because there's
01:14:10.26 --> 01:14:15.06 something we don't want to go. But there's, there's the attitude most guys want to go. And they
01:14:15.06 --> 01:14:19.62 want to go fight. But there's also, you have to deploy to other parts of the world where there's no
01:14:19.62 --> 01:14:23.54 work going on. You might just deploy to the Pacific or you might deploy. In this case, you
01:14:23.54 --> 01:14:29.30 come is for European commands. That's going over to Germany and doing, doing things out of
01:14:29.30 --> 01:14:36.10 Germany in different parts of Europe. And it's definitely not a high threat in five minutes. And so,
01:14:36.10 --> 01:14:41.70 yeah, and that's the way it goes sometimes. There's a mission that has to be done. And it's a different
01:14:41.70 --> 01:14:46.02 kind of mission. You're going to build relationships with other countries and you do these exercises
01:14:46.02 --> 01:14:53.14 and do training events. But it's not generally what guys are excited to do in the seal team. So
01:14:53.14 --> 01:14:57.94 there's always, there's always a, you know, I always get asked that question when I go and talk to
01:14:57.94 --> 01:15:05.14 seals is, hey, my guys are going here. How do I keep them on? How do I keep them engaged when
01:15:05.14 --> 01:15:08.82 yeah, no one wants to do it or they don't care about it. And it's like, yeah, you got to work through that.
01:15:08.82 --> 01:15:13.46 It's definitely, it's definitely a challenge because, you know, I would imagine, especially if you
01:15:13.46 --> 01:15:19.30 know, like that you're going to you come and then starting that work up. Because you still have to
01:15:19.30 --> 01:15:25.06 go through the work up and train as if, you know, your fucking life depends on it and that you're
01:15:25.06 --> 01:15:32.10 going to war and, you know, that you're the elite, you know, warrior and and you have to be ready for
01:15:32.10 --> 01:15:40.66 anything. So you like obviously our training is developed around that. But then having to keep
01:15:40.66 --> 01:15:46.26 up that motivation like it's, it's one thing when you're like fuckedy. This training sucks and
01:15:46.26 --> 01:15:53.94 it's um tired. It's hot. You know, like fucking covered in shit or whatever and I've got a hike
01:15:53.94 --> 01:16:00.50 12 miles carrying this thing and it's like, well, we got to do it though because we're going to
01:16:00.50 --> 01:16:05.62 fucking war like this serious, you know. But then it's like, don't you come and why the fuck are we
01:16:05.62 --> 01:16:13.38 even training today? You know what I mean? But I don't know. So I didn't really have that attitude though.
01:16:13.38 --> 01:16:18.66 I was kind of excited to, you know, I had just gotten, we just done that, that year deployment
01:16:18.66 --> 01:16:25.30 to Afghanistan and it was, you know, my platoon was the one that was really, really shitty shitty
01:16:25.30 --> 01:16:32.34 living. The other two platoons were in nice bases that they were like had awesome gyms, like
01:16:32.34 --> 01:16:40.90 good food and stuff like that and, you know, so I wasn't, I wasn't too terribly upset about it.
01:16:40.90 --> 01:16:47.78 Obviously like everyone wants to go work and and kill bad guys like a champion. But, you know,
01:16:47.78 --> 01:16:52.58 when you, when you got to do it that it is what it is, you might as well fucking enjoy it.
01:16:52.58 --> 01:16:55.38 That's why I feel. Might as well make the most of it.
01:16:55.38 --> 01:17:02.90 At what point did you start GJitsu? I started, I started GJitsu actually in Buds.
01:17:04.34 --> 01:17:12.26 That was my introduction to Buds. One of our Buds instructors was, he, he was interested in
01:17:12.26 --> 01:17:20.50 GJitsu and liked it or whatever. And so as a punishment one day we had to do wet and sandy
01:17:20.50 --> 01:17:28.02 GJitsu, like introduction to GJitsu. And like a lot of guys were, we're not enjoying it because
01:17:29.22 --> 01:17:34.34 one, if you've never done GJitsu, you're 100% gonna get fucked up by anyone who has done it.
01:17:34.98 --> 01:17:40.10 And we were wet and sandy, so it was like just cold and wet and miserable and sand paper,
01:17:40.10 --> 01:17:44.58 like grinding on each other, you know. But I actually really enjoyed it. I was like holy shit,
01:17:44.58 --> 01:17:51.30 this is pretty cool. And one of the guys, there was two guys in our class that were both
01:17:52.18 --> 01:17:59.54 really high level wrestlers, like in high school. And they were probably like on a blue belt level,
01:17:59.54 --> 01:18:07.86 you know. They were probably like 135, 145 pounds. And at the time I was around 185, 190 pounds.
01:18:07.86 --> 01:18:14.18 I'd never done GJitsu ever or wrestled or anything like that. And I always punched, you know,
01:18:14.18 --> 01:18:18.58 I knew I punched hard, because I've been in a lot of fights, like street fights and shit,
01:18:18.58 --> 01:18:24.58 bar fights, but at that point, sorry, it wasn't bar fights, so it was like high school fights.
01:18:26.42 --> 01:18:34.18 Dodge ball fights. I did get in a dodge ball fight once, no bullshit. And so anyway, these,
01:18:34.18 --> 01:18:40.90 these little guys just tied me in a fucking knot. And I was just so impressed. Like,
01:18:41.54 --> 01:18:47.14 because looking at these dudes, I would be like 100% I'll fuck this guy up in a fight. And
01:18:47.86 --> 01:18:52.58 we, you know, they were like, all right, no striking, no, no punching, but we're going to grapple.
01:18:52.58 --> 01:18:57.94 I don't like, okay. And we're grappling, and they're just completely fucking me up. And I was like,
01:18:57.94 --> 01:19:05.14 thinking, oh my god, if these little 80-bitty men can tie me in a knot like this and just make me
01:19:05.14 --> 01:19:13.70 helpless, like imagine what I could do if I learned this. So I started rolling with one of my friends
01:19:13.70 --> 01:19:24.66 who was like 6 to 240 pounds at the time and just super aggressive. And he was probably around a
01:19:24.66 --> 01:19:31.54 blue belt level of knowledge, maybe not quite a blue belt. You know, but he knew definitely more than I did.
01:19:32.26 --> 01:19:40.58 And he was really aggressive too and he was like all about rolling. So we would roll nogy
01:19:41.30 --> 01:19:47.78 and he would just constantly. This was where, this was in Buds or in Buds and then SQT,
01:19:49.06 --> 01:19:53.86 Buds was the introduction to it. And I was like, whoa, I fucking love this is cool. And then I
01:19:53.86 --> 01:19:59.94 started talking to one of my classmates who is also into it and you know, he had done, he had done some
01:19:59.94 --> 01:20:04.34 training before the Navy and like I said, he was around a blue belt level. So when you got to Team
01:20:04.34 --> 01:20:09.70 10, did you start training or media that one of the academies? No, I didn't start training at one of the
01:20:09.70 --> 01:20:15.78 academies until after Afghanistan, I came back and because one of the guys, one of my like my
01:20:15.78 --> 01:20:25.46 see that he was, he was a purple belt at the time and we would roll on occasion, you know,
01:20:25.46 --> 01:20:32.58 and he would be like, and he would tell me like, man, you have like great, you know, aggression and
01:20:32.58 --> 01:20:38.26 ability and all this shit, but you got to go to an academy and learn, you know, and I had only learned
01:20:38.90 --> 01:20:44.98 just from that guy that dude beat my ass over and over and he would literally like just just
01:20:44.98 --> 01:20:50.74 fucking get on top pressure, grind, arm triangle, you know, and he'd be like, all right, man,
01:20:51.62 --> 01:20:56.74 you know, I got on top, you know, I fucking arm triangle, I squeezed like that. Don't let me do that again.
01:20:57.30 --> 01:21:03.62 Like, all right, got it. Yeah, try harder. Try harder, you know, you, you got to do something.
01:21:03.62 --> 01:21:09.46 No, you're not doing anything, you know what I mean? So it was one of those. So I had gotten pretty good
01:21:09.46 --> 01:21:17.30 at just getting my ass kicked and dealing with a big large human or whatever. So then when I actually showed
01:21:17.30 --> 01:21:24.74 up to an academy, I'd been doing that for a couple years, you know, with him and never put on a
01:21:24.74 --> 01:21:29.30 gear or anything like that, but then afterwards, yeah, he was like, you got to join Jim. So I joined
01:21:29.30 --> 01:21:35.30 a Jim, put on the gear and then really like, that's when my jiu-jitsu, I would say, really
01:21:35.30 --> 01:21:41.70 started my journey and that was in 2012. And did you have someone to train with on your U-com
01:21:41.70 --> 01:21:51.06 deployment? Um, yeah, trained with my CDADD, he was there and I trained and U-com, like we were
01:21:51.06 --> 01:21:56.02 obviously going to different countries. So I would go and hit up different gyms and the different
01:21:56.02 --> 01:22:02.02 countries and then all the other, the other countries, seal teams, you know, that we worked with.
01:22:02.02 --> 01:22:07.46 There's always someone who's in the combatives, you know, so I would basically just find out who
01:22:07.46 --> 01:22:13.46 that guy was. Yeah, who wants to get some and then we'd roll the mats out and fucking train and
01:22:13.46 --> 01:22:18.58 and I was trying to get guys in the jiu-jitsu back then and I was telling, you know, it's a great
01:22:18.58 --> 01:22:24.10 workout and people are just looking at me like, that's not a fucking workout and you know,
01:22:24.10 --> 01:22:29.70 you're not lifting weights, you're not running, you know, I'm like dude, it is a workout for sure.
01:22:29.70 --> 01:22:37.46 And it's, you know, one that the reason I liked jiu-jitsu specifically was because it was like a
01:22:37.46 --> 01:22:44.98 deadly martial art, you know, I could fucking choke you and like you're tapping, you're asking me,
01:22:44.98 --> 01:22:50.42 like please don't kill me, you know, and that's what I thought was fucking cool about it.
01:22:51.30 --> 01:22:56.34 And uh, that is definitely one of the cool things about it. You know, like there's there's times
01:22:56.34 --> 01:23:05.06 where I don't know, yeah, like we're we're gunfighters, I get it, but your first line is should be you,
01:23:05.06 --> 01:23:13.14 like my, my body. What can I do with my fucking vessel that I was brought into this universe with,
01:23:13.14 --> 01:23:18.82 like versus you? If I don't have a weapon, if I don't, you know, it's just me and you.
01:23:18.82 --> 01:23:23.14 Yeah, one of one, like let's go. Yeah, I mean, I got to see you like over and over again,
01:23:23.14 --> 01:23:28.18 just guys that didn't know how to didn't know anything and they'd get in a simple prisoner
01:23:28.18 --> 01:23:33.30 handling situation and wouldn't be able to handle someone. And the only thing that they would
01:23:33.30 --> 01:23:39.54 know to do is like bludgeon them in the head, which is cool. That's fine. I get it. But when you
01:23:39.54 --> 01:23:45.54 bring that person into the detainment facility and they're freaking all jacked up and then it turns
01:23:45.54 --> 01:23:50.98 out that they're not the person you were looking for or whatever. And, and that just doesn't,
01:23:50.98 --> 01:23:57.06 that's just not, that's just not cool. And it's not, it's not, it's not tactically the best thing to do
01:23:57.06 --> 01:24:02.02 because you don't have the control. I mean, you can't count on punching someone or hit them in the
01:24:02.02 --> 01:24:07.70 head. You can't count on that solving the problem. Whereas, jiu-jitsu, it's like, yeah, no, I have this
01:24:07.70 --> 01:24:14.50 human under control. Whereas, you know, you've punched people before that you've nailed them
01:24:14.50 --> 01:24:18.90 and they shook it off like it didn't even happen. You know, the whole thing with like,
01:24:18.90 --> 01:24:26.18 muscle strikes. I've seen, I've had guys, I mean, I've muscle strike plenty of people, but I've
01:24:26.18 --> 01:24:33.70 had guys that I've seen put the craziest, most aggressive muscle strike on a dude and have the
01:24:33.70 --> 01:24:40.50 dude's bleeding. Yeah, but like still fighting. Yeah, I do think that one's a fucking hell thing. And so,
01:24:40.50 --> 01:24:44.42 so yeah, from the, especially when people are in fear for their life. Oh, yeah, definitely.
01:24:44.42 --> 01:24:51.06 And they hate you and they hate your society and they're a geodist. It's like, yeah, that,
01:24:51.06 --> 01:24:56.90 muscle strike, if it doesn't knock them out, which sure it is possible. But the idea that that was
01:24:56.90 --> 01:25:00.34 just going to stop someone in their tracks 100% of the time was completely ludicrous.
01:25:01.06 --> 01:25:06.26 Now, with jiu-jitsu at least you're going to have some control, more control. And even that's
01:25:06.26 --> 01:25:10.02 not 100% you know, because you could, you know, you've got someone that's really small,
01:25:10.02 --> 01:25:13.06 it's someone that's really big and depending on your skill level, there could be issues there.
01:25:13.06 --> 01:25:17.86 But yeah, so you finally started training at a school. Yeah.
01:25:17.86 --> 01:25:24.82 2012. Yeah. And they just dove in all the way. Yeah, I started, I started training at a school in
01:25:24.82 --> 01:25:32.98 2012 and started competing in jiu-jitsu. You know, I really, once I once I joined a school,
01:25:33.54 --> 01:25:39.62 I learned more in six months than I did in four years of course, no-gui rolling with my buddies.
01:25:39.62 --> 01:25:45.62 You know, and I mean that it was just the blindly, the blind essentially, like who knows the most today.
01:25:45.62 --> 01:25:49.54 And that's like you guys are all fucking wrong. We're all teaching each other wrong shit, you know,
01:25:49.54 --> 01:25:55.54 and I mean, so I learned more in six months than I did that whole time. And so at that point,
01:25:55.54 --> 01:26:03.54 I'd really like fallen in love with jiu-jitsu. And I started competing all the time and was doing
01:26:03.54 --> 01:26:09.06 really well because I was competing as a white belt, you know, but I had already had a
01:26:09.06 --> 01:26:13.78 shit load of grappling experience, you know, with fucking big strong dudes who are just
01:26:13.78 --> 01:26:21.70 fucking me up. But now, like, now I'm the big strong guy and I know a little bit and I've been in
01:26:21.70 --> 01:26:29.54 like hard situations on the map, you know what I mean? And then obviously just the team guy just
01:26:29.54 --> 01:26:35.06 will to fight, you know, that's always a different level. You can tell when you roll with a team
01:26:35.06 --> 01:26:42.02 guy, even when a team guy is brand new at jiu-jitsu, they're still going to be, you can just tell
01:26:42.02 --> 01:26:48.98 that they're different because their will to fight is generally higher. Yeah. So anyway, I start
01:26:48.98 --> 01:26:55.78 competing a lot and doing really well and then start fighting and doing really well in that as well.
01:26:55.78 --> 01:27:00.50 And then, you know, that led me to what I'm doing now. And then you actually took over when you came
01:27:00.50 --> 01:27:06.42 home from your U.K. to play me to go over the combatants program? Yeah. Yeah. I took over the combatants
01:27:06.42 --> 01:27:16.98 program that was something that, you know, I felt like kind of lacked in the seal teams. You know,
01:27:16.98 --> 01:27:22.42 I was very shocked at that. I was surprised at that. You know, obviously where
01:27:22.42 --> 01:27:30.58 the seals are the best in the world, you know, at what we do. And, you know, we're gunfighters
01:27:30.58 --> 01:27:38.50 and all that shit. But I would imagine that our hand-to-hand combat, you know, like everyone thinks,
01:27:38.50 --> 01:27:44.50 like, oh, if I can see, he must, you know, tap me on the shoulder and I'll die, you know. And it's true.
01:27:45.14 --> 01:27:50.98 Just forever when he's listening. It's definitely true. But I hadn't gone to that school yet.
01:27:50.98 --> 01:27:59.70 So I was like confused as to why that wasn't a school or whatever. So anyway, I felt like with at this
01:27:59.70 --> 01:28:06.18 point, I was, I was competing quite a bit and having, having some pretty good success in the
01:28:07.30 --> 01:28:14.74 fight MMA, Gigi-Jitsu world. And I'd also had, you know, real world experience, you know, a lot of
01:28:14.74 --> 01:28:22.34 real world experience dealing with prisoner handling and stuff like that. And I just felt like,
01:28:22.34 --> 01:28:32.66 I felt like I could bring, I felt like I could do a good job at leading the combatives. So
01:28:33.94 --> 01:28:41.70 I took that on board and they gave me a shot and I rewrote the curriculum for combatives that we
01:28:41.70 --> 01:28:48.34 used on the East Coast and it was, it was really good, you know, and I went into with the
01:28:48.34 --> 01:28:55.06 operationally focused mindset, you know, not, if, if you're doing it, I'm all about Gigi-Jitsu. I love
01:28:55.06 --> 01:29:00.02 Gigi-Jitsu. However, if you're doing a triangle choke on target, something's probably
01:29:00.02 --> 01:29:08.02 going terribly wrong. But it's definitely not a bad thing to know Gigi-Jitsu, you know, to
01:29:08.02 --> 01:29:13.70 mean especially as an operator, you're dealing with human beings and you're not just, you know,
01:29:13.70 --> 01:29:19.14 you're not just going to go in and fucking kill everyone on target, you know, there could that happen,
01:29:19.14 --> 01:29:24.42 yeah, absolutely. But is that going to have them probably not? And you're going to have to deal with
01:29:24.42 --> 01:29:32.74 human beings and, you know, anything from just marshaling them to a full-on fight for your life
01:29:32.74 --> 01:29:42.58 is combatives related, you know, so I covered all of that in my program and I really focused on
01:29:44.42 --> 01:29:51.38 basic, simple things that you could remember during a time of stress, you know, like,
01:29:52.18 --> 01:29:58.50 you're not going to remember 12 steps to an arm bar, something like that when you're in a situation
01:29:58.50 --> 01:30:04.74 and you need it, you know what I mean, especially in a combative situation overseas, like that's,
01:30:04.74 --> 01:30:09.38 your adrenaline's going to be going like crazy, it's going to be fast, you need something simple
01:30:09.38 --> 01:30:16.18 effective and that, you know, that you can remember easily. And it's also, you know, how it is like
01:30:16.18 --> 01:30:21.14 in a, in a work-up, you're, you're, you're getting fed through a fire hose essentially,
01:30:21.14 --> 01:30:24.42 it's so much shit, you're, you're learning and you're expected to be
01:30:24.42 --> 01:30:31.94 proficient and like, perfect at all, all of it before you go out the door. So our combatives, we didn't
01:30:31.94 --> 01:30:38.10 get a whole lot of time, you know, it was like a two-week thing and so I, I really focused on
01:30:38.10 --> 01:30:46.26 developing techniques and things that, you know, and would also be effective,
01:30:46.26 --> 01:30:56.58 effective towards your enemy or your, your person that you're dealing with, but also mitigate
01:30:56.58 --> 01:31:02.18 risk to the operator, you know, like, muzzle strikes are great because you can muzzle strike a
01:31:02.18 --> 01:31:06.50 hundred people in a row in your hands feel fine, you know, you're not worried about breaking
01:31:06.50 --> 01:31:12.50 your weapons in control. Yeah, so, you know, that was kind of my focus was operationally
01:31:12.50 --> 01:31:20.26 focused mindset and, you know, and on the west coast, I felt like, yeah, from what I had seen,
01:31:20.26 --> 01:31:26.58 going out there and working with those guys, it was a lot of, uh, I felt like more guys were
01:31:26.58 --> 01:31:31.70 interested in combatives, but there was more of like a sporty kind of thing, like they're up in the
01:31:31.70 --> 01:31:37.38 fight room, doing jujitsu and stuff like that and which, which I thought was great, like I said,
01:31:37.38 --> 01:31:44.42 it's better, it's definitely better to, to, you know, have it not needed, then need it not have it.
01:31:44.42 --> 01:31:49.22 And so I think that it was good that guys were doing that, but I didn't think that it was
01:31:49.22 --> 01:31:53.94 operationally focused enough, you know, like, I don't think that you should be training combatives
01:31:53.94 --> 01:32:00.66 and PT gear, you know, like I had my, like the program that I set up was all scenario driven
01:32:00.66 --> 01:32:07.54 and it was all like trained like you fight, you know, so in your, in your camis and your boots with
01:32:07.54 --> 01:32:14.50 your gear, you know, because handling someone and PT gear versus handling someone and, you know,
01:32:14.50 --> 01:32:22.82 a full kit is totally different as well. Yeah, yeah, well, there's, it's, you know, I was,
01:32:22.82 --> 01:32:28.34 the discussion that used to happen a lot with all this stuff, because believe me, I was in this
01:32:28.34 --> 01:32:36.50 discussion for a long, long time. If you, you reach, or you get a ton of fucking pushback.
01:32:36.50 --> 01:32:43.22 People are super, people are simple, emotional about, about combatives and, you know,
01:32:43.22 --> 01:32:50.18 I would always, like, I wasn't, I wasn't as emotional as I wasn't very emotional about it,
01:32:50.18 --> 01:32:54.82 but for me, it was just like, hey, guys need to know how to do this. This is, this isn't about
01:32:54.82 --> 01:33:00.58 emotion. This is about just the facts of being ready to be prepared, being prepared on the battlefield.
01:33:00.58 --> 01:33:06.26 That's what you need to be. And, you know, one of the things that people would say was, you know,
01:33:07.94 --> 01:33:13.30 the, like the speed shooting contest, you shouldn't do that because it'll take away from your
01:33:13.30 --> 01:33:19.94 operational capability. Okay, I get it. However, who does better on the range? The guy that's like a,
01:33:19.94 --> 01:33:26.90 a hobby shooter, too, and then goes out to whatever CQC, he's drilling nails all day long.
01:33:26.90 --> 01:33:32.18 The same thing with a parachuteing, like, okay, so I skydive whatever. I'm a skydiver on the
01:33:32.18 --> 01:33:37.62 weekends, and I like to go down and have a ton of jumps. I have, you know, 2000 jumps with my slick rig.
01:33:37.62 --> 01:33:41.94 How do I do when I put a combat equipment on? I do awesome. I'm way better than, like, a guy
01:33:41.94 --> 01:33:46.98 like me, because I wasn't like a recreational skydiver. When I ever put equipment on, it was like,
01:33:46.98 --> 01:33:52.26 it was a, it was a, I had to pay attention. Whereas the guys that were good skydivers in the civilian side,
01:33:52.26 --> 01:33:59.54 they were good. Same thing with like, oh, who's going to do better in a grappling match, a guy that
01:33:59.54 --> 01:34:05.46 wrestled in high school with his gear on or a guy that, you know, has his gear on, it's like it doesn't matter.
01:34:05.46 --> 01:34:10.98 You get certain skill level, and you're going to do great. And that's just the way it is. Now,
01:34:11.38 --> 01:34:16.66 what you can't do is just say, oh, well, we're never going to train with gear on, because there
01:34:16.66 --> 01:34:21.30 are certain, you know, it's like saying, hey, I'm never going to train with the gear. If you,
01:34:21.30 --> 01:34:25.22 if someone never train with the gear before, and they go against someone with the gear,
01:34:25.22 --> 01:34:29.70 it depends on how long that person's been training with the gear for, because hey, no gear
01:34:29.70 --> 01:34:34.98 and gear have all kinds of similarities. They have all kinds of similarities. They also have some
01:34:34.98 --> 01:34:40.42 differences, and depending on how much you do of each is where you're going to kind of shake out,
01:34:40.42 --> 01:34:47.62 which one you're better at. But there are so much crossover between gear and no gear between
01:34:47.62 --> 01:34:53.46 skydiving on the weekends and skydiving in the teams and shooting on the weekends and shooting in
01:34:53.46 --> 01:34:59.46 the teams. The way I was looked at it was train more train all the time with everything, you know,
01:34:59.46 --> 01:35:04.58 as much as you can. And that's, that's how you get better at things. But yeah, that combat of
01:35:04.58 --> 01:35:14.18 thing was, it still was, it still is. I know. It's hard. It's hard to change. It's a shift. It's a taboo thing
01:35:14.18 --> 01:35:22.34 for some reason, and it totally depends on who's at the head of the table. You know, what, what
01:35:22.34 --> 01:35:28.18 their flavor is, what their take is on it. And if the guy, you know, is like you or me, and then it's like,
01:35:28.18 --> 01:35:32.82 hey, we're all going to fucking, we all need to know this. We all need to, and then other guys come in,
01:35:32.82 --> 01:35:37.70 they're like, oh, that shit's stupid. We don't need that. Yeah. And I was, I was when someone would say,
01:35:37.70 --> 01:35:42.50 guys should be working on shooting. I'd say, you know, I totally agree. Absolutely. You know,
01:35:42.50 --> 01:35:46.82 give us a range, you know, in the building. And we'll do that in the building, because that's
01:35:46.82 --> 01:35:53.70 without question or primary weapon system. And, you know, no doubt, you want to be a great shot,
01:35:53.70 --> 01:35:59.22 for sure. Guess what? How many hours are you going to shoot today? I mean, are you going to shoot
01:35:59.22 --> 01:36:02.98 22 hours a day? Because you're going to have some time at some point where you go, you know what,
01:36:02.98 --> 01:36:07.38 let's get some other skills in here. You know, we might as well know, and like you said earlier,
01:36:07.86 --> 01:36:12.42 you can't just go, you don't just go on target and shoot everyone. There's a, there's a,
01:36:13.30 --> 01:36:19.30 female, you know, Dave Burke, who's one of the guys at echelon front. Good deal. Yeah, he has a,
01:36:19.30 --> 01:36:23.22 he has a story that he tells about the first time he came face to face with the, like,
01:36:23.22 --> 01:36:28.10 Iraqi woman that did not want him in the house. And he's, you know, whatever, a 18-year
01:36:28.10 --> 01:36:36.02 marine at this point, and he didn't know what to do. Yeah. And it's like, yeah, you, you, you need to
01:36:36.02 --> 01:36:41.62 train. You need to train to handle those situations. And, and a lot of people, you know, that people
01:36:41.62 --> 01:36:49.86 are unpredictable. They're just totally unpredictable. And especially in a situation where they don't
01:36:49.86 --> 01:36:55.86 know, like, a bunch of people with guns and body armor just busted up in their fucking house. Like,
01:36:55.86 --> 01:37:02.50 you think that person's going to be like, just cool as a cucumber or a calm, like, I don't know.
01:37:02.50 --> 01:37:08.26 And then when you put hands on people to, people freak the fuck out. And, and you know, and you don't
01:37:08.26 --> 01:37:14.42 need to just muzzle strike everyone. Like you said, like, if you do that, you're going to get
01:37:14.42 --> 01:37:20.26 shut down real quick. You know what I mean? And you should be as an elite warrior, you should be
01:37:20.26 --> 01:37:27.94 expected, or at least I expect people to handle themselves. Like, and you shouldn't let this
01:37:27.94 --> 01:37:33.54 fucking Iraqi woman just walk all over you or fucking flail around because like, you don't know what to
01:37:33.54 --> 01:37:38.66 do. I can't muzzle strike or I can't shoot her. So what do I got to do? You know what I mean?
01:37:38.66 --> 01:37:44.26 And if you've never, and that's just like a woman. But if let, now you have like a fighting age
01:37:44.26 --> 01:37:50.74 male or something. And you know, if he resists, I'll just kill no. That's not the case always. You know,
01:37:50.74 --> 01:37:59.14 it's definitely not like, and you know, you definitely don't want the first time that you're
01:37:59.14 --> 01:38:05.06 handling a human being like that to be overseas when it's real. And they can, you know, very easily
01:38:05.06 --> 01:38:11.70 get to your shit on your kit. And you know, it can be a bad day. And especially like, I tell people,
01:38:11.70 --> 01:38:17.14 you know, just think of like muzzle, muzzle discipline and awareness, you know, like when you have
01:38:17.14 --> 01:38:21.46 your gun, even at high ready and then you're marshalling someone and they freak the fuck out. Now
01:38:21.46 --> 01:38:26.34 all of a sudden you've got a hot weapon, like going around the room, it's just shit that there's so
01:38:26.34 --> 01:38:32.66 much things that you, you need to think about. And the more you do, the more comfortable you're
01:38:32.66 --> 01:38:38.66 going to be with it. And that was kind of my mindset towards it. At what point did you realize you were
01:38:38.66 --> 01:38:50.74 going to get out? Well, I wasn't sure I was fighting and stuff. And I was just kind of doing that
01:38:50.74 --> 01:38:59.46 as as for fun as a hobby on the weekends and competing and stuff like that. And then I had gone out
01:38:59.46 --> 01:39:09.14 and trained at blackhouse with some UFC fighters. And I had always like looked at the UFC,
01:39:09.86 --> 01:39:17.70 you know, I was always a fan. And I enjoyed fighting and stuff. And but I'd always looked at those
01:39:17.70 --> 01:39:23.70 guys like they were kind of superhuman or like, like it was like the NFL of fighting, like those
01:39:23.70 --> 01:39:27.46 guys are genetic freaks or whatever. You know what I mean? When you think of someone in the NFL,
01:39:27.46 --> 01:39:33.38 you're just like, man, it must be nice to be born like that, you know, or whatever. But fighting
01:39:33.38 --> 01:39:41.30 is kind of a unique thing where, I don't know, anyone can do it. And as long as you just put in the
01:39:41.30 --> 01:39:49.54 the work, you know what I mean? So, and being a genetic freak helps too. But, but I got in there,
01:39:49.54 --> 01:39:53.78 I got in the blackhouse and I trained with some of the people in the UFC and I was just like,
01:39:53.78 --> 01:40:00.34 holy shit, like, I'm actually like doing fine. Like I'm hanging with these guys. And, and
01:40:00.34 --> 01:40:05.70 I'm, you know, talking to them and just kind of getting to know some of these guys and just made
01:40:05.70 --> 01:40:10.10 it a little more human. You know what I'm like? What did you do before your fighter? Like,
01:40:10.10 --> 01:40:15.78 oh, I fucking worked on a restaurant, you know, as a bus boy or whatever. I was, you know, this,
01:40:15.78 --> 01:40:20.34 that third. And I was just thinking, you know, and they're all looking at me like, dude, you're
01:40:20.34 --> 01:40:25.62 fucking navy seal. Like, and I'm just like, yeah, but that's all I've ever, no, and that's all I've
01:40:25.62 --> 01:40:32.58 ever done. I did right out of high school, you know. And, and I'm just me, you know, and I know,
01:40:32.58 --> 01:40:40.02 like, I'm not special, you know what I mean? And it just kind of made it, it had a like a shift or
01:40:40.02 --> 01:40:47.54 like a realization, like, these are just people just like you and, and they just fucking stuck with
01:40:47.54 --> 01:40:53.78 fighting and practiced it until they were good enough to beat, you know, the competition and now they're
01:40:53.78 --> 01:40:59.62 here. And I was like, fuck, I, I could do that. Like, I'm pretty good, you know, and yeah, and I've
01:40:59.62 --> 01:41:06.02 been through some shit, like, I could push myself hard. Like, fuck, I could do this. And at the time,
01:41:06.02 --> 01:41:14.02 like, I was already been a seal for a while and, and, you know, I got to experience a ton
01:41:14.02 --> 01:41:23.86 and life and just, in war and, and just that whole lifestyle and that whole thing and, and, uh,
01:41:26.10 --> 01:41:33.22 I was just out of crossroads, you know, and I was like, well, I can stay in and make a career out of
01:41:33.22 --> 01:41:39.62 this, like I was planning on doing, I was planning on staying in for 20 years, um, and, you know,
01:41:39.62 --> 01:41:46.90 I can screen and, you know, try and make it over there and, or I can get out and kind of pursue this
01:41:46.90 --> 01:41:54.34 and, and at the time I was 29 or, yeah, I was 27 when I was like, making this decision.
01:41:54.34 --> 01:42:02.26 And, um, I was like, you know, fighting this kind of a young man's game and, uh, like you read earlier
01:42:02.26 --> 01:42:07.46 in the beginning of this, like, you can't, you can't even pause time, you know, wait for no one.
01:42:07.46 --> 01:42:17.78 And, uh, I was like, well, if I, if I just keep down this road, I, I don't want to think like,
01:42:17.78 --> 01:42:24.50 what if or like regret, you know, and I was like, I've already been on this path for a while and,
01:42:24.50 --> 01:42:31.30 and it's cool and all that, but I want to see what else I can do. So, and I was really
01:42:31.30 --> 01:42:35.86 fucking struggling with, with that decision for a long time, it was stressing me out and,
01:42:35.86 --> 01:42:42.26 uh, then once I just said, fuck it and this decided, you know, which way I was going,
01:42:42.26 --> 01:42:46.90 then the, like, all that stress, like, relief, this, it was a big reliever.
01:42:47.86 --> 01:42:51.54 And, uh, yeah, decided to get out and, there's what you, what you read that?
01:42:52.74 --> 01:42:56.02 Um, I got out in 2018.
01:42:57.06 --> 01:42:59.78 And, how many amateur fights did you have when you were in?
01:43:00.90 --> 01:43:03.14 Uh, like, 17 or something?
01:43:03.14 --> 01:43:05.70 And then, and did you go pro while you were still in?
01:43:05.70 --> 01:43:11.78 No, they wouldn't let me. And that was like, it was so frustrating to me because in Virginia,
01:43:11.78 --> 01:43:18.42 the amateur rule set is the exact same as pro. So, it's day before weigh-ins, um, you know,
01:43:18.42 --> 01:43:24.74 all strikes, like, those, those, no shimpads, you know, it's four ounce gloves, no head gear,
01:43:24.74 --> 01:43:32.18 you know, it's, it's, uh, it's fucking pro. Or five minute rounds? Uh, no, there were three,
01:43:32.18 --> 01:43:35.94 three, three minute rounds. Three minute rounds, yeah. Three minute rounds.
01:43:36.66 --> 01:43:40.26 Um, but some, some of them had five minute rounds, like I thought North Carolina.
01:43:41.38 --> 01:43:47.06 So, yeah, it was no different, you know, and, uh, trying to explain that to like my command and shit,
01:43:48.10 --> 01:43:54.18 and I'm like, there is literally no difference. And a guess what, like, a punch from punch in the
01:43:54.18 --> 01:43:59.30 face from an amateur feels the same from a pro. That's what I'll tell you about. Like,
01:43:59.30 --> 01:44:03.78 those, that bruise that came from an amateur, it would've came from a pro too.
01:44:03.78 --> 01:44:09.30 When I talked to Tim Kennedy about this, like, it's so crazy that Army gave that guy and gives him
01:44:09.30 --> 01:44:14.50 so much, he's a great guy and obviously a credible fighter. But yeah, I mean, he was just full
01:44:14.50 --> 01:44:19.46 on just getting after it, right? Well, and he still is. Yeah, and they support him. Yeah, he's all,
01:44:19.46 --> 01:44:26.58 it's awesome. They take some date. Man, I ran into total fucking roadblocks left and right with my
01:44:26.58 --> 01:44:33.30 fighting. And, um, you know, and I used to argument all the time, like, guys, you don't understand the
01:44:33.30 --> 01:44:38.10 same way, Brian stay up. Yeah, he was in the Marine Corps. Yeah, I talked to Brian Boffs or the Marine
01:44:38.10 --> 01:44:44.74 Corps just out there fighting in the WEC. But the, uh, no training, Tim Kennedy, they, they sponsored him.
01:44:44.74 --> 01:44:51.46 Yeah. Yeah. And there was like Ranger up or whatever. Yeah. Well, Ranger's up is actually Tim's company.
01:44:51.46 --> 01:44:58.26 No Tim, but for a while, Tim, Tim was like, he, I forget the exact story, but he, he was sponsored
01:44:58.26 --> 01:45:03.22 by, like, the Army. Yeah, for a while. They were using it as like a recruiting tool. And then he said,
01:45:03.22 --> 01:45:07.38 listen, you can either keep paying me a sponsorship or you can just let me come back on active duty.
01:45:07.38 --> 01:45:12.74 And, and they were like, uh, that sounds like a good financial deal for us. So yeah, Tim, Tim's,
01:45:12.74 --> 01:45:19.70 yeah, and that's, and that's why I kind of was forced to choose because I was running into so much
01:45:19.70 --> 01:45:28.42 fucking bullshit. Yeah. And, um, you know, like glory, uh, glory had come to town. And they were doing
01:45:28.42 --> 01:45:35.22 a fight at the Hampton Coliseum. And, um, you know, at this point, I had already had quite a few fights
01:45:35.22 --> 01:45:42.50 under my belt and had some popularity, I guess, as a fighter and, and they had heard about me. And,
01:45:44.26 --> 01:45:49.46 they invited me to fight on the show. And Mike Tyson was going to be there in shit. And I was like,
01:45:49.46 --> 01:45:56.74 man, this is going to be a fucking huge opportunity. It's on Spike TV too. And, um, I was, you know,
01:45:56.74 --> 01:46:02.42 I was like, can I, can I fight on this? And, and they're like, yeah, you know, we'll, we'll see what
01:46:02.42 --> 01:46:09.30 we can do. Love a blonde. And then last, you know, last minute they, they told me, no, you know,
01:46:09.30 --> 01:46:14.98 and I was just like, if I would've been your boss, you would've been fighting. And that's, that's
01:46:14.98 --> 01:46:20.42 a shitty part is like, you know, it depends on who's, who's at the table at the moment.
01:46:20.42 --> 01:46:23.78 And you know, now that I think about it, because I'm just sitting here thinking like,
01:46:23.78 --> 01:46:29.06 there's probably a, in fact, I remember seeing some kind of policy that they put in place at
01:46:29.06 --> 01:46:34.34 some point. I forget even to say if it was yes or no, I forget. But I remember. But my argument to
01:46:34.34 --> 01:46:38.50 it was like, all the time was like, like, just same one with the skydiving, you know, like,
01:46:38.50 --> 01:46:43.38 guys fucking skydive all the time, there's leap frogs, you know, why not, why don't the navy,
01:46:43.38 --> 01:46:49.14 why doesn't the navy use me as a recruiting tool, you know, like, I, I would, I don't want to get
01:46:49.14 --> 01:46:54.34 out of the teams. I want to stay in the teams, but I also want to fight and like, I can do this.
01:46:54.34 --> 01:46:59.62 Like, I was ranked number one on the East Coast and two weight classes, you know, and I was like,
01:47:00.42 --> 01:47:08.18 I'm pretty good at this shit, like, you know, and I don't understand why we don't utilize this,
01:47:08.18 --> 01:47:13.38 you utilize me as a recruiting tool, you know, go to the fight, set up a fucking pull-up bar, hand out
01:47:13.38 --> 01:47:17.78 t-shirts and try and hand, you know, or go to the, they had me go to the national,
01:47:17.78 --> 01:47:26.10 uh, high school wrestling contest or tournament, and they had me do like a combatives demonstration
01:47:26.10 --> 01:47:30.90 and and had me go out there and wrestle with all the, the high school students and stuff.
01:47:30.90 --> 01:47:36.50 Yeah, yeah, I fucking brought it. Yeah, I'll tell you what, we had an assumption for all of you.
01:47:36.50 --> 01:47:43.54 Yeah, you know, I was up at the California State Championships last year, or no, it was 2019, yeah.
01:47:43.54 --> 01:47:49.06 It was like, a bunch of high-endism. Well, yeah, I mean, my, my, my daughter was competing, and, but,
01:47:49.06 --> 01:47:55.30 you know, we're up there at the boys, they're just animals, they're animals. It's, it's awesome to see.
01:47:55.30 --> 01:47:59.06 Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, those, those kids were fucking taught. Oh, yeah,
01:47:59.06 --> 01:48:04.34 they put in and they fucking, they all wanted some. Oh, sure, yeah. They were like, and, and, because I was there
01:48:04.34 --> 01:48:11.38 in like, Cammy, Cammy pants, you know, in the fucking blue UDT seal shirts and, and we brought the
01:48:11.38 --> 01:48:17.70 bullet bar and, and, you know, because the, I think, but buds like, they try to get wrestlers.
01:48:17.70 --> 01:48:22.82 Sure, they do. Because wrestlers, you know, wrestlers, I don't want you to want to say,
01:48:22.82 --> 01:48:26.50 wrestlers have a good chance of making it through buds because that's not true. It's definitely
01:48:26.50 --> 01:48:31.78 not true. It was slightly better chance than a normal. Right. However, not right. However, wrestlers
01:48:31.78 --> 01:48:38.58 are used to a fucking grind. And that's probably why they're a little bit more comfortable and
01:48:38.58 --> 01:48:44.90 used to the grind factor of buds that does not mean they're used to getting cold and wet and
01:48:44.90 --> 01:48:49.78 dealing with all that shit, but they're used to dealing with the grind. So, whatever. And they're
01:48:49.78 --> 01:48:55.70 competitive. So, uh, so we went there and yeah, all those, all these fucking high school wrestlers
01:48:55.70 --> 01:49:01.30 are looking at me like, I got something to prove, you know, or whatever. And, and I'm out there
01:49:01.30 --> 01:49:05.78 representing the fucking seal team. So, like, I got something to prove to you, let's go, young buck.
01:49:05.78 --> 01:49:12.18 And, uh, so we, we, no, it was a good time. But I was like, why don't they fucking, they're
01:49:12.18 --> 01:49:18.26 cool with this, but not like fighting, like, what's the difference? Like, I don't know. So,
01:49:18.26 --> 01:49:24.58 I just ran into tons of frustrating headaches like that. And that's what ultimately
01:49:24.58 --> 01:49:29.54 decided to, you know, I was just decided to go this way. And I'm glad I did, but
01:49:29.54 --> 01:49:35.14 yeah, and that's, you know, I got to say like the seal teams, I never tried to fight pro, but
01:49:35.14 --> 01:49:39.62 like the seal teams was totally support, like I would go and train at places that give me.
01:49:39.62 --> 01:49:45.22 Well, the West Coast was, yeah, a lot different. Yes. You guys, you guys are definitely more
01:49:45.22 --> 01:49:52.90 supported on that kind of stuff. Extra curricular. Sure. Thanks. So, you get out and then when did
01:49:52.90 --> 01:49:58.82 you go pro? Uh, right after I got out. So, you've been pro for a year, or a half, two years, right?
01:49:58.82 --> 01:50:03.38 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How many fight pro fights do you have? I've only done two pro fights so far.
01:50:03.94 --> 01:50:13.06 I won my first one by TKO in the third round. It was a good, really good fight against another
01:50:13.06 --> 01:50:18.42 pro who he was a pro boxer as well, and he had called me out and kind of campaigned for the fight
01:50:18.42 --> 01:50:27.14 or whatever, and so I bled. And then, and then I did my LFA debut.
01:50:27.14 --> 01:50:34.10 Um, I fight in that sungun. I don't know if you've seen any pictures of videos. I have unfortunately seen that.
01:50:34.10 --> 01:50:42.42 Yeah, you can't unsee it. You're welcome. So, that's actually my buddy, Jeff Gumm. He owns that company.
01:50:42.42 --> 01:50:49.22 Yeah, no Jeff. Yeah, so, um, so obviously, like, I tried to support other team guys and their ventures
01:50:49.22 --> 01:50:56.26 and stuff like that, and, you know, um, that was right up my alley with the, uh, I thought it was funny.
01:50:56.26 --> 01:51:02.42 If I'll pretty much do anything if I think it's funny. And, uh, so I, I fought in the sungo, which is
01:51:02.42 --> 01:51:08.18 for those of you don't know, it, it's kind of looks like a American flag diaper sort of thing.
01:51:08.98 --> 01:51:14.42 But it's sex. Yeah, well, it's from Brazil. In Brazil, there's a sungun, there's a sungow.
01:51:15.14 --> 01:51:19.94 And I think this sungow is like the smaller one and the sungow is like a little bit, but they're
01:51:19.94 --> 01:51:25.62 their speedos. Yeah, they're such a speedos. Yeah, they're speedos. There's speedos and Dean Lister
01:51:26.90 --> 01:51:33.78 because he has so much Brazilian influence in his brain, he went through his face of training
01:51:34.82 --> 01:51:40.34 with a sungow. And, and, uh, those are some of the worst years in my life. Yeah, I'm sorry.
01:51:40.34 --> 01:51:49.38 But, no, no, or self, we can't do that today. Yeah, so, uh, I'm not, I'm very anti-sunga and sungow.
01:51:49.94 --> 01:51:55.14 But, but you, you know, you go for it. Well, I'd ask you, it's if, if I wouldn't, I would make me want
01:51:55.14 --> 01:51:58.82 to fight you less if you were wearing that. So you got that little cycle out there. Right?
01:51:58.82 --> 01:52:04.26 Do it, or it was like confusing to them. Yeah. Yeah, which is, I mean, do you know what,
01:52:04.26 --> 01:52:08.34 were you watching like UFC when everyone was when all the Brazilians were still wearing them and you
01:52:08.34 --> 01:52:12.98 have to see, and they still do sometimes. Yeah, yeah, I've seen some of them. Yeah, but anyways.
01:52:12.98 --> 01:52:18.42 But I thought it was funny. So, uh, so I got a little patch sewn into it so I got put my cup in it
01:52:18.42 --> 01:52:25.30 and that was my, my new fighting attire. And, uh, yeah, I went out. It, it could never,
01:52:27.14 --> 01:52:34.34 I don't know, it was awesome. We'll say that. Uh, I went out. I, I, I fought on LFA, on National TV.
01:52:34.34 --> 01:52:42.10 And, um, I, it was during a military appreciation fight. And so they hosted the fight
01:52:42.10 --> 01:52:48.34 in at an army base and it was in a hanger, you know, with helicopters and we got all these people,
01:52:48.34 --> 01:52:53.14 all these active duty army people and their uniforms and stuff in the crowd. And, uh,
01:52:54.18 --> 01:52:59.94 you know, here I am the, the Navy seal and the American flag speedo and, and come out to fight,
01:52:59.94 --> 01:53:08.66 um, and got knocked out 30 seconds. So it's like, good. I can't get really that much worse from here.
01:53:08.66 --> 01:53:15.86 So that's cool. Day. But now it was, it was actually, they called it the craziest 31 seconds in LFA history.
01:53:15.86 --> 01:53:18.26 Yeah, I watched it. I watched it. It was, it was, it was, it was. It was, it was. It was, it was. It
01:53:18.26 --> 01:53:22.74 would have a lot of time to watch fights. Yeah. I had time for life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:53:22.74 --> 01:53:28.34 But yeah, it's, uh, I, I saw it. I, I, I think you posted it somewhere or, I posted it. I posted the
01:53:28.34 --> 01:53:33.38 video. I mean, which some, which so many people were, were so kind, like they were like,
01:53:33.38 --> 01:53:38.34 wow, I can't believe you posted this and like sat him down first, right? Then you sit him down?
01:53:38.34 --> 01:53:44.90 No. So he had a 14 inch reach on me. He was 6, 6, 3 and, um, fucking big astute. And
01:53:45.78 --> 01:53:50.02 honestly, like, I didn't even know, like we were, we were, we were recordgile with each other,
01:53:50.02 --> 01:53:54.18 like at Wands and stuff like that. So I wasn't sure if like we were going to touch gloves or not,
01:53:54.18 --> 01:53:58.90 you know, because it's always kind of a, I feel like they should just like make that a rule like you are.
01:53:58.90 --> 01:54:04.98 You, you either do or you're done. It's a rule with me now. But I, uh, I wasn't sure if we were
01:54:04.98 --> 01:54:10.18 going to touch gloves or not and like kind of coming out due to he honestly, he hit me like,
01:54:10.18 --> 01:54:15.94 I didn't even know he could reach me from where he was. And it was just like, I think from that,
01:54:15.94 --> 01:54:22.50 that, that big weight, I do a big weight cut and, uh, I think it just, you know, just fucking,
01:54:22.50 --> 01:54:29.78 just put me on queer street right away. And, uh, so right out of the gates, I was rocked and,
01:54:29.78 --> 01:54:36.66 and was kind of fell down and was just, he'd swarm me and I was just getting punches thrown at me,
01:54:37.94 --> 01:54:42.98 left and right. And I'm just kind of like seeing stars trying to gain my composure. And then,
01:54:42.98 --> 01:54:49.22 I finally like got backed up and, and, uh, against the cage and, and, uh, gain my composure
01:54:49.22 --> 01:54:56.66 for a second, landed a one, a clean one too and, and dropped him and then ran over, like got excited
01:54:56.66 --> 01:55:03.22 when I dropped him down kind of went over towards him and, and fucking just, I think probably
01:55:03.22 --> 01:55:08.58 my coordination was just kind of off still from just getting rocked and, and I literally just tripped
01:55:08.58 --> 01:55:15.30 right over, head over him over his body. And then as we're both standing up, he fucking threw
01:55:15.30 --> 01:55:23.38 another punch and, that was it. So, and I was just like, God damn it, I'm a fucking navy seal on
01:55:23.38 --> 01:55:29.86 a army base, like fighting in an American-like Speedo, a national TV and just got knocked the
01:55:29.86 --> 01:55:40.26 fuck out. Yeah. Good toss. Yeah. I don't know what to tell you. Yeah. No, that's, that's
01:55:40.26 --> 01:55:44.66 what I'm saying, man, you're getting out there. Hey, yeah, that's what you got to do. There's, there's, there's
01:55:44.66 --> 01:55:50.10 going to be a winner to lose or, and if you, the real losers are the ones that are actually
01:55:50.10 --> 01:55:55.06 not getting in the ring. So, you know, a lot, a lot more times than that, I've come out victorious.
01:55:55.06 --> 01:56:01.94 So, uh, it is what it is. I don't, it didn't slow me down, doesn't bump me out or whatever, just
01:56:02.82 --> 01:56:07.30 part of it. And I, I understand that going into it, so risk them all to take.
01:56:07.30 --> 01:56:13.06 Yeah, what's your next fight? Um, we're setting up one, uh, looking at August 25th and, uh,
01:56:13.06 --> 01:56:19.70 Riverside, hopefully, with the LFA. So, hopefully that goes through and, and I'll be,
01:56:20.26 --> 01:56:27.14 I'll set to go, right? Any idea on a pony yet? No. I don't care who it is. Just, I just want someone.
01:56:27.14 --> 01:56:32.82 Yeah. I don't care. Like, I, I never really care who my opponent is. Honestly, I don't,
01:56:32.82 --> 01:56:38.10 I don't look at, really, their skillset or I never have really, I don't care because
01:56:39.38 --> 01:56:46.10 I've dealt with people just so much in, like, combatives and, and jujitsu and fighting, it's just, like,
01:56:46.82 --> 01:56:53.06 people are unpredictable. And that's what I stick with. Like, you may think you have a game plan
01:56:53.06 --> 01:56:57.14 figured out and then all of a sudden they do something different. And I don't even want to be thinking
01:56:57.14 --> 01:57:01.62 about, oh, well, I thought you was going to do this. And I had this set up for this. And,
01:57:01.62 --> 01:57:06.82 you know what I mean? Like, I know what you mean. I will say this when you find out who your
01:57:06.82 --> 01:57:11.22 opponent is. You got to watch him. You got to watch him. You got to at least figure out because
01:57:11.22 --> 01:57:16.50 there's people that have things. They have their game. And if they have that game and you,
01:57:16.50 --> 01:57:23.30 and you know about it, as you know, like if, if you know, I'm good at whatever, you'll defend that thing.
01:57:23.30 --> 01:57:29.78 Right? And if you don't know it, well, then I'll get you in that situation, right? If you really
01:57:29.78 --> 01:57:34.82 let's like, um, what, what, anybody, anybody, if you, everyone's got that thing at their game that they're
01:57:34.82 --> 01:57:39.06 good at, right? And like, in jjitsu, hey, this guy's got a good gaiting. This guy's got a good on him.
01:57:39.06 --> 01:57:44.02 This guy's got a good, good, heal hooks or whatever. Everyone's got their little thing. And if they're
01:57:44.02 --> 01:57:53.30 good at it, then that's what they'll kind of steer you towards. But, um, yeah, so I was, and, and I
01:57:53.30 --> 01:57:58.74 would say, look, I get it. We don't care the opponent is, but when you find out who you're
01:57:58.74 --> 01:58:03.46 opponent is, take a look, you know, send it to me. Let me look at, you know what I mean? Because
01:58:03.46 --> 01:58:08.82 I've been watching these, for sure. Things forever to say, hey, looks like this guy's got this.
01:58:08.82 --> 01:58:12.74 And you also have to watch more than, you know, watch like three or four fights and see if they
01:58:12.74 --> 01:58:17.30 have any grappling tournaments that are posted on, Nagar or whatever on YouTube, you know, you find
01:58:17.30 --> 01:58:21.54 out what kind of game they have. And if you can do that, then you can learn from it, and you can take it into
01:58:21.54 --> 01:58:27.30 the, you can take it into the cage with you. Yeah, no, I, I'm definitely not opposed to doing that at all.
01:58:27.30 --> 01:58:33.30 I just, uh, I just don't put all my eggs in the back of you. You know what I mean? And that
01:58:33.30 --> 01:58:37.30 way, I don't, if, if shit doesn't go according to plan, like, that's cool. Because they're just
01:58:37.30 --> 01:58:42.26 evolved to. Yeah, they're going to evolve, but guess what they'll go back to, they'll go back to
01:58:42.26 --> 01:58:48.02 what they're good at. Right. I mean, so that's another thing to think about. And cool. Um,
01:58:48.02 --> 01:58:58.10 I, uh, so that glory, that actual story, um, when I had gotten told know, uh, that I wasn't able
01:58:58.10 --> 01:59:04.50 to do that fucking event in, in Hampton Road, so I was, I was really bummed out and, uh, so I ended up
01:59:04.50 --> 01:59:08.66 actually just come like, I, I already like had decided at that point. I was like, you know,
01:59:08.66 --> 01:59:13.62 it fucked up. So I'm getting out of the Navy. Like, I'm, I don't want, I don't want to be told
01:59:13.62 --> 01:59:20.26 what I can't, I can't do or whatever, you know what I mean? Like, and, uh, so I called the, the guy back
01:59:20.26 --> 01:59:25.14 and said, well, when's it in next one? And he was like, oh, we got it, we got another one coming
01:59:25.14 --> 01:59:31.62 up in San Diego. And I said, put me on that one. And so I just took leave and, like, I'm just going
01:59:31.62 --> 01:59:37.70 to San Diego and I ended up fighting on the glory court. San Diego, I just took leave and
01:59:37.70 --> 01:59:42.02 went now there and did it anyway. And, uh, ended up knocking the guy out in the second round.
01:59:42.02 --> 01:59:47.06 Right, all. Yeah, that's pretty good outcome. Well, this is a pretty good spot.
01:59:47.78 --> 01:59:52.50 Since we're up to current events, what else, I know you got your supplement company, you got T-shirts,
01:59:52.50 --> 01:59:58.58 what else, how can people support what you got going on? Um, I would say, uh, the biggest, uh,
01:59:58.58 --> 02:00:04.50 big sways, probably on Instagram. Um, that's my, really my only platform. Uh, I put out a lot of
02:00:04.50 --> 02:00:10.26 content on Instagram. I do, uh, my live streams from there. I thought about doing a podcast as well,
02:00:10.26 --> 02:00:15.46 but, uh, I think I'm just going to stick to my Instagram lives and just kind of treat them as podcasts
02:00:15.46 --> 02:00:21.62 or whatever, uh, because I like talking and interacting with, with my supporters a lot. And, uh,
02:00:22.90 --> 02:00:29.46 you know, so I figure people will get bored just talking to me for a long time in a room like this.
02:00:29.46 --> 02:00:36.66 I don't know. But, uh, yeah, I would say, uh, follow me on Instagram at, uh, at Mitch Aguar.
02:00:36.66 --> 02:00:45.30 Um, and yeah, we've got a supplement company, um, our main product is a thing called this
02:00:45.30 --> 02:00:52.34 smashing greens. What I gave you today. Yeah. And, uh, that, that actually is a blend of different
02:00:52.34 --> 02:00:58.50 organic superfoods. Um, so I watched this documentary called Fat Sick and Nearly Dead.
02:00:59.22 --> 02:01:04.98 I don't know if you've seen it or not. I have not. It's on Netflix. And, uh, this guy, he, he was
02:01:04.98 --> 02:01:11.54 really overweight and had this some sort of skin disease and he ended up getting a juicer and ended up
02:01:11.54 --> 02:01:18.02 doing 60 days of just vegetable juice. And, uh, he ended up losing a ton of weight and, um,
02:01:19.86 --> 02:01:26.26 his skin disease cleared up and just like the doctors were just like blown away at at how
02:01:26.26 --> 02:01:31.62 healthy he had become, you know, just from, from doing all this and learned about micro nutrients and
02:01:31.62 --> 02:01:38.34 all this stuff. So I was like, man, that seems like a cool, uh, cool thing. Like, I want to try it,
02:01:38.34 --> 02:01:43.78 you know, I've never fasted before or anything like that. And, uh, went out and bought a juicer and
02:01:43.78 --> 02:01:51.78 it was, it was, uh, fucking pain in the ass to clean that thing, like three times a day and I was
02:01:51.78 --> 02:01:57.94 having, I had to buy like $30 worth of vegetables every day to make enough juice to, you know, put
02:01:57.94 --> 02:02:03.06 into a glass that would somewhat keep me full. And I was just like, there's gotta be a better way than
02:02:03.06 --> 02:02:14.10 this shit. And so, uh, ended up going to a vitamin shop and saw, like, organic freeze-dried wheat
02:02:14.10 --> 02:02:18.66 grass. And you just had water to it and I was like, oh my god, that's so much better, you know. So
02:02:18.66 --> 02:02:24.58 I went and basically picked out a bunch of ingredients that I did research on that, you know,
02:02:24.58 --> 02:02:34.26 things that I wanted and, um, and, uh, put them all into, like, a shaker cup and added water and
02:02:34.26 --> 02:02:41.62 drank it and did it a fast that way. And, uh, it was obviously much cheaper, much better, like,
02:02:41.62 --> 02:02:46.18 just more, way more convenient and everything like that. And I just didn't have anything
02:02:46.18 --> 02:02:52.58 in post on Instagram one day. And, uh, and so I just shared it. I was just like, hey, this is kind of
02:02:52.58 --> 02:02:58.26 the concoction that I came up with. And, and I do my, I do a five day fast like this and,
02:02:59.30 --> 02:03:03.22 just kind of, it makes me feel good, helps me lose weight. And then I started doing that, like,
02:03:03.22 --> 02:03:11.62 cutting weight for my fights. And, um, and then people, it just fucking caught on, like, wildfire.
02:03:11.62 --> 02:03:16.10 Like, everyone was like, what is that? What is that? And then, I was like, look, I'm not associated
02:03:16.10 --> 02:03:20.50 with these companies at all, you know, like, these aren't, I don't get it paid for this. Like,
02:03:20.50 --> 02:03:25.62 this is just, here, this is what I do and, like, put it, laid it all out there and it's like,
02:03:25.62 --> 02:03:31.06 you can get all these products on Amazon or your local vitamin shop or whatever. And just made it as
02:03:31.06 --> 02:03:37.14 idiot proof as I could. And I was just getting bombarded with questions nonstop. But, but it was,
02:03:37.14 --> 02:03:42.34 like, a lot of people were having, like, a ton of success fasting with that and losing weight.
02:03:43.06 --> 02:03:47.94 So, I was like, well, that's pretty cool. You know, like, I'm, I'm really, I'm down to help people,
02:03:47.94 --> 02:03:53.46 you know, better themselves and I enjoy, like, pushing people and pushing myself and trying to be
02:03:53.46 --> 02:03:59.54 better and everything. So, um, so I stuck with it and just kept, kept answering all the questions
02:03:59.54 --> 02:04:05.94 or whatever and then after, like, a year and a half or so, ended up, um, making my own, you know,
02:04:05.94 --> 02:04:11.70 just like, well, I might as well fucking make this my own product. And so I found a way to, to kind of
02:04:11.70 --> 02:04:17.70 make that come to life and, um, took all those products basically and just put them into one,
02:04:17.70 --> 02:04:22.50 removed all the fillers and all the bullshit in there and just, it was like, you know, I didn't know
02:04:22.50 --> 02:04:29.30 anything about the supplement industry or anything like that. I just never intended on, on doing that,
02:04:29.30 --> 02:04:36.42 but just kind of came about and, uh, you know, delivered a product that was way more convenient.
02:04:36.42 --> 02:04:42.74 And everyone was already using and buying all these other things. And now, now it's like my product
02:04:42.74 --> 02:04:48.74 and they're able to support me and now it's like, I don't, you know, I don't have an issue answering
02:04:48.74 --> 02:04:55.14 these questions now that you're buying my product, you know what I mean? So, um, now it's, it's been
02:04:55.14 --> 02:05:02.74 super awesome because we've had just a ton of people lose so much weight and like my brother
02:05:02.74 --> 02:05:10.02 lost 110 pounds, you know, using that. So it really works which is cool, you know, and it's really
02:05:10.02 --> 02:05:16.18 helpful for people and it's changing their lives and like I'm all about that. And now like,
02:05:16.18 --> 02:05:21.14 it's supporting me financially now that I'm not out, you know, in the Navy anymore because I didn't,
02:05:21.14 --> 02:05:27.14 I didn't get a retirement or anything like that. Just got out. So, um, so yeah, it's super cool and
02:05:27.14 --> 02:05:33.46 the supplement in a company, but now that I've been in it for a little while, like,
02:05:34.10 --> 02:05:42.34 I'm starting to get more understanding of it and, and we're, we're doing pre-workout,
02:05:42.34 --> 02:05:49.62 protein, BCA's, all that stuff like kind of expanding it and, and, you know, now I'm like really
02:05:49.62 --> 02:05:57.70 involved with it and, and I'm just treating it like everything else, like I always tried to, you know,
02:05:57.70 --> 02:06:03.62 under promise and over deliver and like I always want to make sure that like people are getting,
02:06:04.18 --> 02:06:10.02 like, or something good, you know, I don't want to ever feel like I jipped someone or got one over,
02:06:10.02 --> 02:06:15.78 something like that. Like when people come to use my products, like I want them to be, like a
02:06:15.78 --> 02:06:20.98 fucking satisfied. Yeah, for sure. That's the best policy to have, make the best stuff. Yeah,
02:06:20.98 --> 02:06:28.18 stuff just don't skip, you know, like my, my, my end game is not to make the most profit, like I
02:06:28.18 --> 02:06:33.14 want an actual good fucking product, like that, my name's behind, you know, and I proud of.
02:06:33.14 --> 02:06:42.58 What's the, what's the website? Um, you can either go to smashinfrog.com or massive supplements.com,
02:06:42.58 --> 02:06:51.38 msfsublements.com, either one they go to the same place, but yeah, and we got t-shirts and stuff,
02:06:51.38 --> 02:06:59.14 but I'm basically streamlining my t-shirts, because I had massive apparel, and I just made a
02:06:59.14 --> 02:07:05.38 bunch of t-shirts that that I wanted to make, you know, that were like personal in the me,
02:07:05.38 --> 02:07:10.82 like the mindset is everything, attitude is contagious. Don't be a pussy, be humble, you know,
02:07:10.82 --> 02:07:14.42 these are shirts that like, I've kind of made all the shirts that I want to make, and I made them.
02:07:14.42 --> 02:07:21.38 I was kind of a t-shirt snob before I had my company, and then once I made my company and like
02:07:21.38 --> 02:07:26.26 got into the apparel industry, like I just wanted like really comfortable, nice fitting,
02:07:26.98 --> 02:07:33.22 good quality t-shirts, and printed my own shit on them, and that's all I wear now, but I'm just
02:07:33.22 --> 02:07:41.22 streamlining it down a couple that I like, and I'm actually launching a new brand pretty soon that I'm
02:07:41.22 --> 02:07:47.78 very excited about. Cool, cool, right on there. So if you follow me on Instagram, you'll, uh, you can
02:07:47.78 --> 02:07:54.74 keep up with all that stuff I got going on, and and watch my future fights, and hopefully I don't get
02:07:54.74 --> 02:08:03.06 knocked out. Echo, you got anything? What happened with that dodgeball fight? You're talking about
02:08:03.06 --> 02:08:11.14 how man, uh, it was oddly enough, it was in a church also, so I got into a dodgeball church fight.
02:08:11.94 --> 02:08:19.22 Dodgeball church, did you win that one? I did, and knock the guys to you though. We were there to
02:08:20.10 --> 02:08:26.90 practice our dodgeball, and we were taking it very seriously, you know, because there was a
02:08:26.90 --> 02:08:33.86 tournament coming up that I think had like a $500 prize, which when you're like $16, $500 is
02:08:34.50 --> 02:08:40.82 $1,000,000,000. Yeah, that'll go long way. It'll go a long way. So, you know, the stakes were high, and
02:08:40.82 --> 02:08:48.42 we were, we were there, and there was some local jokers that were just, you know, not
02:08:48.82 --> 02:08:53.78 taking it seriously, and like just fucking with our practice and stuff, and, and...
02:08:53.78 --> 02:08:57.54 dude, if there's one thing that makes me angry, legitimately angry, so people aren't taking dodgeball
02:08:57.54 --> 02:09:04.34 series. You know, it just was. It was, there was a time for joking around, there was a time for
02:09:04.34 --> 02:09:09.22 seriousness, and you know, that wasn't the time, and ended up, you know, I ended up saying something
02:09:09.22 --> 02:09:15.62 to this dude, and just, you just kind of fucking mouth-off, and, you know, my temper's,
02:09:15.62 --> 02:09:21.54 temper's flared, and escalated, yeah, things escalated, and ended up getting into like a full-on
02:09:21.54 --> 02:09:28.58 brawl. Like a dodgy brawl, dodgy brawl, and a dodgy brawl. That's brawl. It's dodgy brawl.
02:09:28.58 --> 02:09:35.86 There you go. So, thank you. It's a good time. Well, awesome. Um, hey, speaking of fighting,
02:09:36.90 --> 02:09:44.98 and smashing things, sure. I mean, echo, yes. We want to be better at fighting. We want to be
02:09:44.98 --> 02:09:50.74 better at living. What do you got? What do you got for us? I got a few things. So, we'll start with
02:09:50.74 --> 02:09:59.78 judgy stew, right? You're like geared, no ghee better. Um, I'm starting to like, no ghee,
02:09:59.78 --> 02:10:06.58 better. I would say just because I feel like it's more applicable to the cage. However, um, you know,
02:10:07.30 --> 02:10:13.38 like Jako was saying earlier, I agree, wholeheartedly, I think that everyone who trains judgy
02:10:13.38 --> 02:10:20.18 stew should train in a ghee as well because, you know, there are a lot of similarities, and I feel like if you
02:10:20.18 --> 02:10:27.38 only train no ghee, and then you go against someone with a put a ghee on with any sort of decent
02:10:27.38 --> 02:10:34.18 skill level, you're going to get fucking choked for sure. Yeah. And it just the ghee slows everything down,
02:10:34.18 --> 02:10:41.54 and it's a, it's a totally different animal. And the thing is, like, you can train in a ghee all the time,
02:10:41.54 --> 02:10:46.58 and take the ghee off and roll with someone no ghee, and you're, you're going to do fine. You're
02:10:46.58 --> 02:10:51.86 you're still doing judgy stew, you know what I mean? It's a different game, but it's not that much different,
02:10:51.86 --> 02:10:58.18 but going from no ghee to ghee, very different. So, that's why I think I think people should
02:10:58.18 --> 02:11:04.42 definitely train in a ghee still. Yeah, agree. Yeah, both is best for sure. Um, yeah, the ghee,
02:11:04.42 --> 02:11:08.82 I add these elements that if you only train no ghee, you're not used to those elements, and if
02:11:08.82 --> 02:11:14.82 someone else is used to those elements, all the no ghee elements are in the ghee, you know,
02:11:14.82 --> 02:11:18.82 like those elements are there for the most part. Of course, in the close, you know, like,
02:11:18.82 --> 02:11:23.46 using like, if you were getting a street fight, like you can use clothes like a ghee. Right. So it
02:11:23.46 --> 02:11:28.82 gives you even that many more options for sure. Oh, yeah, agree. Well, speaking of ghee,
02:11:28.82 --> 02:11:32.26 well, ghee, we're going to get everyone's doing judgets, you know, I feel like it's growing
02:11:33.06 --> 02:11:37.54 essentially. So, kind of ghee, we get an origin ghee. You know, why are we getting origin
02:11:37.54 --> 02:11:42.18 ghee because they're made in America? And they are factually the best ghee in the world.
02:11:42.18 --> 02:11:48.66 Rashcards as well. Okay. So where do we get them at originmain.com? That's also where we're
02:11:48.66 --> 02:11:56.26 getting genes. Yeah. By the way. And I got mine. By the way, approval level 100. You know,
02:11:56.26 --> 02:12:01.38 always reluctant to say, you know, 101% approval, but here I'm going to say it 101% approval,
02:12:01.38 --> 02:12:05.70 because they exceeded literally exceeded my expectations. And your expectations were high.
02:12:05.70 --> 02:12:08.66 Warrior 100%. I was like, yeah, the way you're talking the way they, you know,
02:12:08.66 --> 02:12:13.38 PD does a good job in building these things up. You know, he's taking close-up pictures of the buttons
02:12:13.38 --> 02:12:19.22 coming out of the factory that it's really good. So I'm like, all right, expectation, expectation level is high.
02:12:19.22 --> 02:12:24.34 100%. These have to be five star genes essentially. They're like five star plus some added
02:12:24.34 --> 02:12:31.54 things that I was impressed with. Yes. 101% approval. Yes. So genes, you can get them t-shirts,
02:12:31.54 --> 02:12:38.58 trashcarts, supplements, supplements. Yes. So, well kind of supplements, joint warfare,
02:12:38.98 --> 02:12:42.74 which I'm happy with, man, I've been on the joint warfare. I think it's been one year consistent
02:12:42.74 --> 02:12:50.34 joint warfare, cruel oil. So approved 100% approved. Actually adding value, providing value,
02:12:50.34 --> 02:12:54.02 even beyond what you might think in the beginning. Because you know, one, you know, one, we're
02:12:54.02 --> 02:12:59.86 young, you know, young guys or whatever, you don't care, you know, you have muscle soreness,
02:12:59.86 --> 02:13:04.18 you have all this stuff. What are the joint soreness is one of those things that just kind of creeps up on you.
02:13:04.18 --> 02:13:08.02 But if you're on top of that, that doesn't take you. It'll take you out of the game if you're not ready.
02:13:08.02 --> 02:13:13.30 Preventative. Yeah. And when it comes to my idea, I'd get like elbow stuff from lifting and stuff.
02:13:14.42 --> 02:13:20.82 But if, if I was on like joint warfare, glucose, me and could join any, any one of these things
02:13:20.82 --> 02:13:25.22 that they did recommend when I started grappling, by the way, if I was on that, I would have never got out of the
02:13:25.22 --> 02:13:32.26 game. Yeah, at any point. The last point is get your joint warfare, get your cruel oil and stay on that.
02:13:32.26 --> 02:13:37.78 Get your discipline too. Yeah. Fully. Get your discipline. Discipline is like all day.
02:13:37.78 --> 02:13:42.82 Now. Yes, sir. That's kind of where it's going. It's, yeah. It's like, yes, I guess what I'm just
02:13:42.82 --> 02:13:47.22 drinking. Oh, I'm just going to have some discipline. Right. It's kind of like you poured this,
02:13:47.22 --> 02:13:51.94 uh, is this what you're talking about? Yeah. Yeah. It's just tastiness and goodness.
02:13:51.94 --> 02:13:58.34 Commission is this a pre-workout. Yeah. It's, it's not like a super um, there's not like a super
02:13:58.34 --> 02:14:02.18 caffeinated deal because I don't drink a lot of caffeine and I don't want to drink a lot of caffeine.
02:14:02.90 --> 02:14:10.02 So yeah, you, little cognitive, little physical. Okay. And you, uh, just sip this all day.
02:14:10.98 --> 02:14:16.18 Yeah. I don't have like some. And I won't drink it like after dinner, you know, because I,
02:14:16.18 --> 02:14:20.42 there's a little bit of caffeine in it and I don't drink a lot of caffeine. So not even in the
02:14:20.42 --> 02:14:24.74 mornings when you, when you're waking up. No. Is that 430? Just a little bit of a little bit of a
02:14:24.74 --> 02:14:30.58 t t to the white t has some caffeine in it too. So I guess I do drink caffeine. But I don't drink
02:14:30.58 --> 02:14:37.54 high doses like like a like a monster energy drink or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Speaking of energy
02:14:37.54 --> 02:14:44.42 drink, we got to energy drink on my own. But it's, it's actually good for you, which is completely,
02:14:44.42 --> 02:14:51.54 it's like we, it's hard to call it an energy drink because energy drink puts it in a, in a
02:14:52.26 --> 02:14:57.06 category with things that are actually horrible for you. Yeah. Right. Like there's normal energy
02:14:57.06 --> 02:15:01.46 drinks that are just horrible for you. This is something that you can legitimately just drink and it's
02:15:01.46 --> 02:15:07.78 good for you. Yeah. So that's coming out. You'll see some cans of that in the near future. Oh yeah. That's
02:15:07.78 --> 02:15:15.06 a good one. Oh, the milk. You want to desert. If you want extra protein in the form of
02:15:15.06 --> 02:15:21.06 we desert that that's it. Milk. Off-livers. I like that just like if you want to desert. You have a mint chocolate
02:15:21.06 --> 02:15:28.34 protein right? I was, I have a mint chocolate protein as well. And I was, my, my protein or
02:15:29.14 --> 02:15:35.86 my supplements took a long time to come out like way, I'm sure you've encountered whenever
02:15:35.86 --> 02:15:41.38 you're dealing with any kind of putting out something. Never goes according to plan and it's always
02:15:41.38 --> 02:15:47.30 longer than you're expecting or whatever. And I had done a mint chocolate. I, that was just,
02:15:47.30 --> 02:15:52.26 I've been a huge fan of mint my whole life, mint chocolate, whatever. Me too. Me deliciousness.
02:15:52.66 --> 02:15:57.30 And, uh, and I saw that you put out a mint chocolate and I was like, God damn it, everyone is going
02:15:57.30 --> 02:16:02.98 to think I'll copy chocolate. I don't have the pack. You're in a chocolate. Yeah. Or they'll probably
02:16:02.98 --> 02:16:07.38 think like dang. I thought I was the only one who loved mint chocolate better than everything I was
02:16:07.38 --> 02:16:12.26 like, you know, we all kind of do mint chocolate with a seals, but like you're just two,
02:16:12.26 --> 02:16:16.74 but like mint chocolate. Yeah. Well same thing with Pete, right? I mean not another name
02:16:16.74 --> 02:16:21.62 seal thing, but wait was he in mint chocolate or peanut butter? He was in the mint, but I think
02:16:21.62 --> 02:16:26.18 peanut butter. See, the peanut butter was kind of like that. Yeah, that's not where. Well,
02:16:26.18 --> 02:16:31.78 that's sort of smashing. Well, yeah, and that makes sense because in my opinion, you know, I'm not
02:16:31.78 --> 02:16:37.22 just going to like, my favorite dessert is this or that. I'm not that, you know, but I will say that
02:16:37.22 --> 02:16:42.42 when you came out, it's almost like, you're going public with your mint chocolate, uh, love, um,
02:16:42.42 --> 02:16:49.14 admiration. I was like, hey, me too, but peanut butter chocolate has always been my close close
02:16:49.14 --> 02:16:55.06 second. Yeah. Easy money. But the one that really, the strawberry, because it's just so,
02:16:55.86 --> 02:17:00.66 yeah, good. Oh yeah, but it's strawberry is a staple anyway, you know, it's like staple everything,
02:17:00.66 --> 02:17:05.38 but so it's vanilla, but I'm not over here. I'm not over here jumping up and down about vanilla.
02:17:05.38 --> 02:17:09.54 Yeah, but some people are. I know some people are. I've got a cinnamon toast crunch.
02:17:09.54 --> 02:17:14.10 There you go. Coming out, and I've got to think of a name for it because I don't think I can
02:17:14.10 --> 02:17:19.22 legally call it cinnamon toast crunch. No, I don't know. I don't know what the rules are.
02:17:19.22 --> 02:17:25.70 I thought about thinking of, you know, growing up, uh, I always hit, we were kind of not so, uh,
02:17:25.70 --> 02:17:32.58 financially gifted. Yeah. I'm gonna call that, whatever, living in a trailer. You know, my mom would
02:17:32.58 --> 02:17:40.98 always get fruity dino bites, you know, and cinnamon toast squares. I used to eat those out of the bag.
02:17:42.98 --> 02:17:50.42 That's not what the other kids eat. Yeah, once I joined the Navy and started getting, you know,
02:17:50.42 --> 02:17:57.86 good paycheck. I just, I never, you know, I never again. I always appreciated my serial game.
02:17:57.86 --> 02:18:04.26 It was always the good. The real stuff. Fruity pebbles. There's no fruity dino bites in this house.
02:18:04.26 --> 02:18:10.34 Get out of here with that. Yeah. Come to the bag. Right. The speed to that. Little kids need food.
02:18:10.34 --> 02:18:16.42 That's why I got Warrior Kid Mulk, strawberry, chocolate. Yeah. Let them eat and be healthy.
02:18:16.42 --> 02:18:23.22 They've got that chocolate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My wife gets like, like, she hits a point in the
02:18:23.22 --> 02:18:28.02 day where she's like, man, I'm considering just to go to bed right now or to bust out a
02:18:28.02 --> 02:18:33.06 chocolate tea and just get after it. Literally says that. Decision point. Yeah. And I know the feeling,
02:18:33.06 --> 02:18:37.22 but man, she's really committed to it. You got to take her go to. You got to take something
02:18:37.22 --> 02:18:43.06 or make creative supplement of some kind for a little power nap. Because working on it. You know,
02:18:43.06 --> 02:18:48.26 I did start a rumor that you take naps. No, I freely admit that. Yeah. It's really, yeah.
02:18:48.26 --> 02:18:53.14 It's very open about it. I wrote about it. I wrote about it. In the dismissal free and field
02:18:53.14 --> 02:18:58.58 medieval. Yeah. I mean, if I'm really tired, I elevate my feet above my heart. And I sat in the
02:18:58.58 --> 02:19:03.94 alarm and I'll sleep for eight minutes and eight minutes. Yeah. Power now. Yep. And if you go,
02:19:03.94 --> 02:19:08.50 I mean, sometimes I go 10. But if you start going 15, 20, then you're like legitimately,
02:19:08.50 --> 02:19:13.46 you'll feel groggy. But you know the deal, man, from like you're talking about sleeping in a helicopter.
02:19:13.46 --> 02:19:17.14 Like you wake up from those things. You're totally on fire. You know, it's a sleep for 10 minutes,
02:19:17.14 --> 02:19:23.78 eight minutes, whatever. So yeah, I have no problem with this. The problem with me is, I don't know,
02:19:23.78 --> 02:19:30.98 I tend to nap better than I sleep. And then like when I wake up, my brain just starts going.
02:19:31.54 --> 02:19:35.78 And it just once that happens, it's just, that's it. I'm up.
02:19:35.78 --> 02:19:40.34 So when you say a supplement for power and after it like helps you get into like power and
02:19:40.34 --> 02:19:48.90 up state like that, okay? I don't know. I'm working it. It could be your your cinnamon
02:19:48.90 --> 02:19:55.14 toast crunch flavored situation. Have you taken hypnosis? Uh-huh. Yeah, so origin. So we have,
02:19:55.14 --> 02:19:59.06 we have this thing called hypnosis, which is like a sleep. But yeah, but that's not for now.
02:19:59.06 --> 02:20:03.30 I'm not sure about it. Yeah, you need some of that. You need some of that. Just for eight minutes.
02:20:03.30 --> 02:20:08.74 It's you take a rail of it and you're out for eight minutes, just fully reach out. I'm working on it.
02:20:08.74 --> 02:20:13.54 I'm working on it. Well, wait, but technically and I don't know, this just seems like this is true.
02:20:13.54 --> 02:20:17.30 Power and app. Can you know, you have like what the five phases right of sleep? Yeah,
02:20:17.30 --> 02:20:22.42 or six five versus. I don't either. Yeah, what should I have in some. Yeah. Yeah, so yeah. So you
02:20:22.42 --> 02:20:28.98 can have, you probably get jammed up somewhere in one of those stages, right? Power and app is stage one.
02:20:28.98 --> 02:20:33.78 I think I'm pretty sure it's only stage one. Power and app. I depends on how tired you are.
02:20:33.78 --> 02:20:37.94 Well, then it won't be considered a power and app. If you're like super tired and you go boom all the way
02:20:37.94 --> 02:20:41.62 phase stage five sleep. Right. You went to the idea of sleep. Yeah. Do you have sleep back?
02:20:41.62 --> 02:20:46.26 Yeah, or anything? Nope. No. Yeah. I don't have, I did a sleep study and I don't have sleep
02:20:46.26 --> 02:20:52.98 apnea, but I have insomnia. And it's like I wake up enough not to actually wake me up, but like
02:20:52.98 --> 02:20:58.50 it's like I wake up. No, and even no, I'm awake. Oh, you know what I mean? So I wake up. When I do wake up,
02:20:58.50 --> 02:21:08.10 I'm fucking still exhausted. Yeah. It's great. So one of the, I actually have a CBD line as well,
02:21:08.90 --> 02:21:15.22 which I don't know if you get into the CBD at all. Not really, no. No. But one of the products that
02:21:15.22 --> 02:21:22.58 that we're launching is a thing called green dreams. And it's rapid dissolve. It's a rapid dissolve
02:21:22.58 --> 02:21:29.22 tablet. You put on your tongue and dissolves in like 10 seconds and it's 25 milligrams of CBD and 10
02:21:29.22 --> 02:21:37.78 milligrams of melatonin. So, but that's not for an eight minute. Yeah. That's a good power now. That's
02:21:37.78 --> 02:21:42.50 the going to bed situation. Yeah. That's a good bed situation. That's a good bed situation. Very nice. Right
02:21:42.50 --> 02:21:46.26 all. Well, the opposite of that is Jokwaiti because you don't take that before you go to bed. Maybe
02:21:46.26 --> 02:21:51.94 after you wake up the middle of the day like my wife or whatever. Also, if you're into deadlifting,
02:21:51.94 --> 02:21:57.06 which we all are, of course, it'll increase it to 8,000 pounds, proving by the way double-blind,
02:21:57.06 --> 02:22:04.42 triple placebo situation. No joke. Also, we have our own store. Jokwaiti's store. It's called
02:22:04.42 --> 02:22:10.98 Jokwaiti's store. We got rash guards. We do. I'm sure. Yeah. T-shirts. You want to represent
02:22:10.98 --> 02:22:16.74 while on the path. Oh, there are. Truckers hats. Yeah. For those of us that like truckers like
02:22:16.74 --> 02:22:21.94 truckers hats, which apparently we do. They're nice. One size fits all. There you go. What about
02:22:21.94 --> 02:22:28.10 FlexFit? I did the FlexFit for a while, but you know, I got a small head. Wait, FlexFit has two sizes,
02:22:28.10 --> 02:22:33.22 though. I know. Yeah. So you're ready to get the small medium or the large XL. I don't know nothing
02:22:33.22 --> 02:22:36.74 about the, you're not even about that at all. Don't know anything about it. Turn your back to it.
02:22:36.74 --> 02:22:43.14 Putty's hat, snob, or your. Yeah, hoodies lightweight. And do you find youth for lightweight,
02:22:43.14 --> 02:22:47.94 pretty? Definitely all the time. You're around. Yes, sir. I agree. No, I don't
02:22:47.94 --> 02:22:52.26 want to agree with that one. Do they have a nipers? Yeah. Some of the, well, yes. So the ones we
02:22:52.26 --> 02:22:57.86 have, yes, they have a zipper. I'm a fan of the zipper. The zipper light hoodie with the pockets.
02:22:58.42 --> 02:23:03.86 I agree. I honestly, I don't even have any of my own in my apparel line at the moment, but
02:23:04.66 --> 02:23:09.78 I'm a fan of those. Yeah. Big enough. Yeah. Well, thank you. Dang. You know, I mean, I'm
02:23:09.78 --> 02:23:14.34 to see their teacher or heavy hoodie. That's a real. Yeah. All functional. And I get it.
02:23:14.34 --> 02:23:20.98 You know, but that's like a gift. I'm a zip. A zip that a non or a zipping lightweight.
02:23:20.98 --> 02:23:26.26 I'm a fucking little bit. Yeah. Play some warm guard without. For sure. And, you know,
02:23:26.98 --> 02:23:31.30 hopefully it looks good. Hopefully you like the design. But you will be representing while you're
02:23:31.30 --> 02:23:37.06 on the path. Not a good stuff on their jocco store.com. Some patches on there too. I reordered
02:23:37.06 --> 02:23:43.62 some more patches. They're coming in. I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I don't want to go too
02:23:43.62 --> 02:23:49.70 deep into it. But it resulted in your patches not being available for a little while. They're
02:23:49.70 --> 02:23:54.90 going to be available. You know, you can't buy what's not available. Yeah. Good. Yeah. That's what
02:23:54.90 --> 02:23:58.74 they're telling me too. And I was like, dang, okay. All right. So, you know, you learn something new every
02:23:58.74 --> 02:24:03.78 day. And, you know, speaking of which right on top of things. Trying to be trying to be,
02:24:03.78 --> 02:24:11.62 but anyway, smash the like button. Oh my god. I keep saying that to me. Oh, she doesn't even know
02:24:11.62 --> 02:24:15.54 what that may. I think she have way knows what that means. She's like smash the like button. I was
02:24:15.54 --> 02:24:19.30 like, right, the video that you're pretending to make doesn't even have a like button. No, no,
02:24:19.30 --> 02:24:23.86 you need to just, I got to cut it out. No, no, no, I got to stop her from saying that. That's what
02:24:23.86 --> 02:24:28.10 I can say. But if you're in the mood to smash the like button, if you want to subscribe to this podcast,
02:24:28.10 --> 02:24:33.22 you can. So do that if you want. On wherever you listen to podcasts. Don't forget about the
02:24:33.22 --> 02:24:41.06 Warrior Kid podcast, which there are now three new Warrior Kid podcast live at this time.
02:24:41.06 --> 02:24:45.94 Yeah, good one. Stories from Uncle Jake. Yeah. Stories that teach lessons on interview with
02:24:46.98 --> 02:24:52.58 John Bozack, the Warrior Kid artists that drew Mike in the Dragons talking about how to get
02:24:52.58 --> 02:25:00.74 better at art. How to use art as a tool to better it other things. Yeah. That was good. And those good
02:25:00.74 --> 02:25:07.22 that those like, are you, do you do any art? I didn't draw in my books. No, but I mean, yeah, I can draw.
02:25:08.50 --> 02:25:12.82 He sent me a man and I'm going to post this online. Everybody can oil paintings.
02:25:12.82 --> 02:25:17.14 Oh, for real? Yeah, like, have you? Have you been into that for like a long time? Is that like a new
02:25:17.14 --> 02:25:24.98 situation? I did my first painting in 2000 Easter of 2016. Yeah. It's what kind of new.
02:25:24.98 --> 02:25:31.78 Oh, yeah. It's not like, oh, when I was three, I did my name on definitely not. Jockel has the original
02:25:31.78 --> 02:25:37.46 logo where I have the original logo of Eschalon front. Jockel's design. Actually, these lines some
02:25:37.46 --> 02:25:45.30 other stuff too. Yeah. That's hard to quit. So he drew it. Right. But so, the disconnect was that I drew it.
02:25:45.30 --> 02:25:51.14 I didn't draw with my hand. I drew it on the computer. Like, I drew it on PowerPoint. Like,
02:25:51.14 --> 02:25:56.18 it's so bad. Wait, it's so funny because when I first go and he first sent it to me, I'm like,
02:25:56.18 --> 02:26:00.50 I, of course, you drew it on PowerPoint. You know, it's not like you have one of those
02:26:01.06 --> 02:26:06.18 pads and stuff. You're Jockel. You don't have that kind of stuff. So, but it's not as obvious when you
02:26:06.18 --> 02:26:09.94 get it. You just get the finished product and it literally looks like my daughter drew it with her
02:26:09.94 --> 02:26:14.58 left hand. She's right at it. By the way. And, but the concept was legitimate. It was sound. That's like
02:26:14.58 --> 02:26:20.98 what the National Unfront logo is at this time. So you're pushing and men received. But the
02:26:20.98 --> 02:26:26.90 story is I tried to explain it to you nine different times and you kept sending me back
02:26:26.90 --> 02:26:31.86 junk. Yeah. Well, I mean, I said, okay, pictures worth a thousand words. I don't feel like
02:26:31.86 --> 02:26:38.66 explaining this a thousand times. Let's just send them a rudimentary sketch of the concept,
02:26:38.66 --> 02:26:45.30 which you then chisel about into, you know, glory. Yeah. emphasis on rudimentary, by the way,
02:26:45.30 --> 02:26:50.66 but the comedic part of it is how it looked. It looked like a child drew it. So now, anytime,
02:26:50.66 --> 02:26:54.50 like, if you ask, why have you been into art? Boom, that flashes in my head and he says,
02:26:54.50 --> 02:26:58.74 yes, boom, makes it more funny. I'm going to post it online so we all can have a good laugh.
02:27:00.58 --> 02:27:06.42 Unless, yes, work it about gases out. That interview with John Bozac is very good. Like,
02:27:06.42 --> 02:27:09.94 especially like, because it is he talks about getting like frustrated with stuff. And so that's
02:27:09.94 --> 02:27:14.50 all just for him. It's a little kid's job. It was good. Don't forget about where your kid's soap
02:27:14.50 --> 02:27:20.66 from Irish Oaks Ranch.com that young Aiden is making on his farm. If you get soap, you can
02:27:21.62 --> 02:27:27.94 stay clean. Of course. Also, we have a YouTube channel. If you're interested in the video version,
02:27:27.94 --> 02:27:35.22 you're going to see what Mitch looks like. Hell yeah, I'm handsome. You might be the buffist
02:27:35.22 --> 02:27:41.94 guess we were at right? buffist guess? Yeah, out of 185. Yeah, we've only had like probably
02:27:42.58 --> 02:27:47.46 10 or 15. Yeah. I don't get it. Don't get it. So yeah, yeah, I don't get it. You know how many
02:27:47.46 --> 02:27:54.98 fucking times people, you, Tim Kennedy need to fight. And I'm like, have you seen Tim Kennedy's way
02:27:54.98 --> 02:28:00.90 bigger than me first of all? Fight to 85. I know. Yeah. And what do you fight at? 70, yeah.
02:28:00.90 --> 02:28:10.82 I have fought at 185 as well as a champion at 185 too. I walk around close to 200. Yeah,
02:28:10.82 --> 02:28:17.94 that was. No, Tim is like 215. He's a big dude. I've met him. Just in passing.
02:28:18.82 --> 02:28:25.14 shook his hand one time. But yeah, he's a big dude. I was always told me like that's not
02:28:25.14 --> 02:28:30.34 where you have like kind of like similar stories. Like there's it wouldn't make sense for us,
02:28:30.34 --> 02:28:37.86 stuff like that. Yeah, we just want to see. Yeah, see what a cycle of the warfare is an album with
02:28:37.86 --> 02:28:42.18 tracks. Wait, wait, no, back to YouTube. We have a YouTube channel. I'm going to, I'm going to,
02:28:42.18 --> 02:28:46.74 what do you, what I call explain the value of YouTube? You just did. You can see what Mitch looks
02:28:46.74 --> 02:28:50.18 like. That's just part of the value. That's just like a big part. I mean, that was going to
02:28:50.18 --> 02:28:54.74 shake. Don't, don't, don't undersell that. Yeah, it's huge. But, you know, we have to
02:28:54.74 --> 02:28:58.58 mix our son there's what I was going to say. You know, if you don't watch the whole,
02:28:58.58 --> 02:29:02.34 I'd guess there's excerpts on there. Anyway, I'm going to get some of them are enhanced by
02:29:02.34 --> 02:29:09.62 echo. Yeah. Who puts his artwork onto the video and they might be slightly better than my
02:29:09.62 --> 02:29:15.54 original echelon front logo. Yeah. And maybe a little bit better. That is, I'm over enhanced.
02:29:15.54 --> 02:29:19.14 Yes, some people think. Yes. Some people think they're under enhanced. Yes. Oh,
02:29:19.14 --> 02:29:24.50 the group. Regardless. No less. We have a YouTube channel. That's the point. Yeah. If you want to,
02:29:24.50 --> 02:29:32.50 you can smash, like, let it, sure comment, subscribe, whatever the three things it was in.
02:29:33.22 --> 02:29:35.86 Anyway, yeah, psychological warfare is an album with tracks. If you're,
02:29:35.86 --> 02:29:40.74 grinding into moments of weakness, put in psychological warfare, you'll, it'll solve your
02:29:40.74 --> 02:29:48.90 problem. No weakness. Weakness overcome. If you want the visual version of that, go to flipsidecampus.com.
02:29:49.78 --> 02:29:56.42 My brother Dakota Meyer has a little company where he's making things that you hang on your wall.
02:29:57.46 --> 02:30:04.74 Artistic. Some people call him artistic things. And you can get those. If you want him to make a special one.
02:30:04.74 --> 02:30:10.50 Yeah. Hit him up on Twitter. Do some custom events. Like, if it seems to get some traction,
02:30:10.50 --> 02:30:15.06 yeah, he can put it out. Yeah, he's good. He's doing good stuff. Yeah. On there. Yeah. I
02:30:15.06 --> 02:30:21.70 took him out from time to time. Flipsidecampus.com. Dude, yeah. Also on it. So you got to on it.
02:30:21.70 --> 02:30:25.86 .com slash jockey. You get a lot of good stuff on there, including kettlebells, other work out
02:30:25.86 --> 02:30:32.10 stuff and bring my room. I'm going to Hawaii by the way for one month. I know people people really
02:30:32.10 --> 02:30:37.78 don't, they, they undersell Hawaii. I feel like I feel that with the same way when I went there
02:30:37.78 --> 02:30:44.66 for the first time I was blown away. Where'd you go? Maui and uh, uh, Hawaii. I'm going to
02:30:44.66 --> 02:30:49.86 go. Yeah. One month. I heard that's beautiful. Yes sir. It is. So I'm bringing the rings.
02:30:50.66 --> 02:30:56.10 You're request by the way. That was one of the selling points of rings. This is that you can bring
02:30:56.10 --> 02:31:01.14 them places too. That wasn't really my request. It was a statement. Yeah. statement. Recommendation.
02:31:01.14 --> 02:31:04.74 Recommendation should be reluctant. Recommendation. You sure did. And it was a really, it was a
02:31:04.74 --> 02:31:08.74 legitimate recommendation. On the last, I'm taking it. I'm taking them to Hawaii. Anyway,
02:31:08.74 --> 02:31:13.06 point is the rings I have from on it. You can get those. You can get kettlebells. You can get.
02:31:13.06 --> 02:31:20.26 I have this K. They have this mineral electrolyte, uh, like mix. Right. And I think I might have just
02:31:20.26 --> 02:31:24.42 enhanced what I call the mega mix. It's the pre-workout mega mix. There's two. There's one for
02:31:24.42 --> 02:31:30.26 G just one for lifting. The one for G just to his disobey one scoop of discipline. A little bit of
02:31:30.26 --> 02:31:35.70 gatorade. So it's a half gatorade half water mix. Optional gatorade. Some people don't like gatorade.
02:31:35.70 --> 02:31:40.42 Some people. Yeah. And that's cool. I don't know. But you can put lemon juice in there if you want.
02:31:40.42 --> 02:31:46.66 Sure. Um, like I said, the discipline, the electrolytes from on it. And then, uh, I want to
02:31:46.66 --> 02:31:51.54 add your greens. I'll hook you up. Yeah. That'll be the mega mega mix. That's pre-judicity.
02:31:52.10 --> 02:31:55.70 Is there a certain time where you got to take those greens? No. This whenever you get a
02:31:55.70 --> 02:32:00.82 mint, I'll dig it over there. So that's going to be the pre-judicity. The pre-lifting is essentially
02:32:00.82 --> 02:32:06.34 the same thing except you put a like a caffeinated pre-workout in it. If you're into it. Anyway.
02:32:07.22 --> 02:32:10.58 Anyway, back to on it. That's where you get it. There's a lot of cool stuff on there. You're
02:32:10.58 --> 02:32:15.94 quite a large, large human being yourself, man. Looking good. Yeah. But I don't sound big though. Thank
02:32:15.94 --> 02:32:23.94 you. I respect that. I'm sorry. Does my voice not match how I look? You know, I can't say
02:32:23.94 --> 02:32:29.78 because- Because you saw me. I saw you. You started talking. Yeah. It's kind of ingrained. Yeah.
02:32:29.78 --> 02:32:35.78 All right. There you go. Maybe not though. Had you not spoke. I'd been like, Dan. Yeah.
02:32:35.78 --> 02:32:40.82 The studio's probably fucking got a jacked voice. Yeah. Yeah. Like, talk comes into it. Yeah.
02:32:40.82 --> 02:32:44.66 But it's melodious. It's not jacked. That's all right. I have a high pitch voice.
02:32:44.66 --> 02:32:49.46 melodious. Yeah. Very melodious. Yeah. Interesting. Anyway, yeah. Got some books.
02:32:49.46 --> 02:32:56.74 Way the Warrior Kid 3. It's out. It's called the Way there's a will. Teaching kids about how to
02:32:56.74 --> 02:33:02.10 go horager. That's a little lesson in this book. Yeah. You got to push harder and also teach
02:33:02.10 --> 02:33:07.30 them about their ego and how their ego will get them in trouble. Everyone wishes they would
02:33:07.30 --> 02:33:12.74 learn about ego earlier because it makes your life better. Of course, there's a way the Warrior
02:33:12.74 --> 02:33:18.18 could want to wear the Warrior Kid to marks mission. Those books are four kids to learn to get on
02:33:18.18 --> 02:33:22.98 the path. If they're a little bit younger than that, you can get a Mikey in the dragons.
02:33:23.70 --> 02:33:31.06 They can learn about how to overcome their fear. There's actual pragmatic protocols that you can
02:33:31.06 --> 02:33:35.78 take as a human being to overcome what you're afraid of. Why not learn that when you're five years
02:33:35.78 --> 02:33:39.94 old? Yeah. That's my question. Why not? Because you didn't know about about the book Mikey
02:33:39.94 --> 02:33:44.50 in the Dragons. Now you know about it. Your kids are just out there conquering fears, which is a
02:33:44.50 --> 02:33:49.38 positive thing. Yeah. And that's a good one too because you can like, you know, if you have a
02:33:49.38 --> 02:33:54.02 bedtime routine, you can read to your, you know, four or five year old before they can read.
02:33:54.02 --> 02:33:58.26 It's one where you can read it. Not only can you read the whole thing. If you're like a 50,
02:33:58.26 --> 02:34:03.86 50 minute, you know, but they'll want to hear it again. So it's like a, you know, so when you're
02:34:03.86 --> 02:34:07.78 really while you're reading it over and over again, that lesson won't be in, you know, ingrained
02:34:07.78 --> 02:34:12.58 and instilled deeper and deeper. Rather than just one of the many books. Reposition. Yeah. Exactly.
02:34:12.58 --> 02:34:18.58 Yeah. Then we got the disc, my disc's freedom field manual. If you go, hey, Jocco, can you post
02:34:18.58 --> 02:34:23.38 your workouts? Yes, they're in the disc, my disc's freedom field manual. Hey, Jocco, what do you
02:34:23.38 --> 02:34:26.74 think you should do in a situation like this? Oh, it's in the disc, my disc's freedom field manual.
02:34:26.74 --> 02:34:30.58 Hey, Jocco, what do you eat? It's in the manual. What's your sleep routine? It's in the manual.
02:34:30.58 --> 02:34:36.66 Do you take naps? It's in the manual. It's all in there. So the disc's freedom field manual,
02:34:36.66 --> 02:34:43.22 the guide to getting after it. If you want the audio version of that, it's on iTunes and Amazon
02:34:43.22 --> 02:34:47.46 music and all the MP3 things. And then of course, we got extreme ownership and that I got to
02:34:47.46 --> 02:34:54.74 me a little of leadership written by me and my brother, Lave Babin. Those are going to help you
02:34:56.26 --> 02:35:02.26 become a better leader in your business with your family and in your life. Watch it happen.
