but if you go on on the on it on it on it website you can get stuck on there for a long time just reading all the stuff about it you know like that the krill oil was one and I know about krill oil from long time and they're krill or like these little they're like little shrimp basically teeny tanger you know so teeny tiny shrimp Yeah, and when you have that much of a discrepancy between like a certain element of people's game, like in, and I think Jiu Jitsu tends to be the more prevalent, because a lot of times people would be like, oh, well, certain guys, let's say like a chocolate or a clay guida, they're like, hey, these aren't, well, actually, we'll just say chocolate del. i'm just showing up and talking so appreciate the support so echoes not coming out a pocket for the gig if you want to connect with us if you want to continue these conversations if you want to ask questions and we got some great questions tonight for sure if you want to roll up to you can connect to us through the interwebs on twitter um at jockel willink and of course echo Charles is at echo Charles and i'm going to start a facebook page i think and echo Charles is going to start a facebook page that'll be good i think and thanks for leaving reviews in the podcast on iTunes that's kind of how another way that the word gets spread and of the book stream ownership on amazon.com that also helps us and finally if you really want to help me get out there in the world in your car in the train at your apartment at your house wherever you are at work or at play get out there and get after it so until next time this is jockel and echo out but as always you take that opportunity to make yourself better faster smarter stronger and with those goals nothing is ever finished so thanks to everybody for tuning in to the podcast and listening to it thanks for subscribing and reviewing and spreading the word tell another people about the podcast thanks to on it dot com for the support and what do we got with amazon dot com for support I put a little link again both the websites where you can like give you shop at amazon it's like an affiliate it's like just a way to support this podcast if you shop on amazon you click through there first and it kind of gives us a referral kind of fee you know you know and if you're working out you're gonna eat a little bit more that's how you get big muscles work out good and have the correct workout for muscles which is different kind of work out then if you want to you know get conditioning or something like that and then eat it enough that's what you got to do and eat right after you work out I'm gonna be honest I don't know if I should take a pre workout pre workout is just you know what that is right you just like a little powder it's like is a stimulant it's caffeine in it typically in n02 nitric nitric oxide it basically makes your it basil dilate to you so your vessels get dilated so it you get more of a pompe gives you energy it's just like it's basically stimulant energy So that discipline, like I said, it starts with the shaving and the next thing you're not boiling the water, the next thing you know you're sick and the next thing you're crapping all over the place and the next thing you know other people you're making other people sick, and it starts with the discipline. And I can tell you that there's a lot of lessons that were learned by those Russians on the ground, that were absolutely implemented by American forces in, I know in Romadi, absolutely the amount of similarities for that urban combat, and the things that we watched out for, because of the sacrifices made by the Russian soldiers, I'd say, how do you jump back and I'm glad that we were able to take away some lessons and take those to the battlefield in Romadi, and do things like protect the local populace, and do things like understand their culture. you know what I mean people probably want to know what supplements you take people mainly would ask me that in college it's when everyone wants to hear what's something because they think for some reason that supplements give you big muscles or something they don't they don't think about that whole working out yeah if you click through the website you get you know we get like a little percentage or whatever it's like a referral thing and your book is actually on there as well extreme ownership nice nice like that Oh, what you don't feel good, you know, business business, you know, you don't feel good about it, but that's kind of the fuel, you know, the fuel, it's, I even do it. but that's in specific cases only with jujitsu like if I'm doing like conditioning like now like a matconner something I won't take it because you don't want to give yourself the extra edge but the skill itself of throwing the baseball of shooting a basketball of throwing a football is not as valuable as a skill as number one a martial artist you know moly tie boxing wrestling GJ2 because those are real applicable to life 100% and this is the same thing with shooting a gut I mean that is a real applicable skill that you may need at some point in your life and you should have it you know what supplements do you and echo take what supplements do you take well my number one supplement is steak steak yes beautiful steak that's the number one What if, you know, you're kind of like, you're like this raging hurricane that when it comes by, it turns into like a warm gentle breeze. so that's that's the supplements that I take you know one thing that's been really cool is is picking up a sponsorship from on it for the podcast you know from Joe who's obviously been a big supporter he's actually the reason that we're sitting here right now because Joe Rogan I mean Tim Ferriss had the same thing with Joe Rogan said you need to have your own podcast it's real in-depthing you get stuck on this real interesting too because they tell you like what are the benefits you know how do they know that these benefits are there because you can't just say hey take this little cure this you can't just do that you got to go through this process but everything else like something you get free shipping also which is kind of seems like a small deal and doing the cuz I've sold things online and stuff before like insurance and that's the none of the stuff is here and of course I bought things online yeah it's like it seems like if I'm free just for conditioning it's kind of like I want to do the mat yeah that's it that's pretty much it it's funny because a lot of people they think that if you take protein powder it'll make your muscles big like it'll help you get big muscles but no like if you take your favorite supplement which is steak just eat normal And that's one of the things that I really like about the simulation training or paint ball training or laser tag training is it allows you to have somebody else shoot back it to you, which is just like just like rolling in GJT or sparring more Thai or sparring MMA right I think it's safe to say I don't feel uncomfortable by saying there was a little bit of a cardio deficit that would be reached very quick I'll echo Charles on the mat so more accurately being tired was more of an issue for me like dealing with being tired you know certain people will get tired Yeah, because we never hear any of this stuff like growing up, you know, you say, okay, don't blame, but it's, it's not like a real strong message that you're saying growing up. that's it that's all the supplements right there I will take the krill oil though for sure because that's gonna help me last question juggle I would enjoy hearing your thoughts on leading others to a strong finish in both a deployment and in the civilian life this is this is something that I saw in combat even on my first deployment to Iraq and it's something that I tried to train out of people and that was a tendency to relax once a target was secure or the vehicles were loaded and we were leaving the target area people would have a tendency to let their guard down but you can't let your guard down then or ever really and in training when I was running training we always hit the platoon's hard on target I mean, maybe not the way people picture martial arts nowadays, because when you picture martial art, people picture, you know, a guy with a guy doing karate. oh and they give us a discount so or so on it is giving our listeners a discount like 10% my people and what I did find out on it regardless of whatever discount you get they you have free shipping on everything except I want to say that the big oh I don't know it's done
