So I'm like I break out my silver ranger Like as I know what's going on My lips are as white as this piece of paper like just like that chunks some like I'm feeling off and like I You know I'll be fine, but I Literally got like three hours to like die So all these little things that we do you know like They came out they they they somebody had to carry the thread of Being able to do this stuff all right for during these time periods and that's what that's what we were doing You know make making sure that this thread Making sure that the knowledge at least at a minimum level stayed in place and a lot of it is not even the tactics and stop it's the I don't know and it still teams I think The world the word like phrase old school has to always be there It has to they're like just beat you up through everything or that's not an old school thing just just that attitude like you got a At least every day and a silver tune still true salt team whatever you're talking about someone's got to be like Don't be a fucking pussy just do it and shut the buck up Don't don't give up when you know don't like get away from you like I don't I want to say principles like hate that word, but You know whatever you believe it like the teams like for me does like The jocco brief you know what though when you kind of think about it what you call it like phonetically or whatever I don't know if that's the correct word, but like when you say jocco it's kind of matches, you know like jocco store Jocco brief it's not like it's like They're looking for They're looking for like a one like a one thing answer of like you know if you could tell yourself There's another if you if you go back and tell yourself your 20 year old self what would you tell yourself like it's or Invest in What is it apple apple or whatever I'll never know what's the one leadership lesson you like there's always that kind of thing or They ask it about everything, man. and like I mean so I'm asking the cat like hey mate, you know These dogs like they're good at like exercises like oh no, mate. And he goes up to the grinder with me and like what's he gonna do like punch me because that The teams that's kind of like a you know still a thing you know I wouldn't go crying to HR or whatever that is We don't have that it's just like Fucking figured out hit each other and be done with it and go back to work Yeah, be a good team guy, right, but yeah looking at it seems like Those days there was there was Seems like you would need to we needed as a community to look at like what could happen One one big thing that I was looking at when I was a young team guy was I realized a long fucking time ago that There are no terrorists really I mean, I'm wrong about some things and if can't understand, but there are no real bad guys in the middle of fucking nowhere There's gonna be buildings. I mean I actually shot some guy in the war whatever you know like yawning like Yeah, like Hunting elk I'm like this You know I finally like get that like Because my throat's like this big you know there's like nothing there's no airway So I put my rocker. Yeah, it's like so many they can't remember Like all the shit, you know I'd look at the notebooks and usually that none of them were like full Some of like three quarters then I lost it in a pair of bag And he had the two game series and like man you're hitting over 400 just don't play You know you're the only guys ever hit over 400 he's like fuck that He went like Three for five and he went to like 406 407 Do you want me to be You know like five miles swim like 10 mile run and then two miles swim like Dude like it takes all day Doing the monster mash is fried in I mean they were fun. But then you if not you're just like I should have did this, but I'm just all we can stupid and then you just get all mad You end up doing that anyway, so my just doing it over with um As a sniper team leader prepping for deployment in your opinion one of the top five things I should drill in my guys On two support combat operations limited range time about one range every other month I Wouldn't be so concerned about range time I'd be concerned about environmental shooting like night time low light sundown son up Communication To any other not so much like sniper spotter like everything was this put yourself in a Ah I know that's an important question to like someone who doesn't know you I don't know maybe Not like destroy everyone in the morning you get two sections sessions so like when they had to actually do something I had to yell in their other year because I had cauliflower air fucking torqued Hey, hey, well he chuckle what do you think about this you just be like Just like turn and walk away Then they got me like looking at me like we want to meet for Oh, he just doesn't want to talk to you. This is like my whole life like I don't care if I ever go home, you know, this is what I do this is our profession, you know, and And I would hold some ammon animosity towards on that piss me off basically did it seem to you Like it seemed to me well as it was just from what you just said I think that there were some guys in the teams at that time period That were not thinking at all that we were going to war No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He'll go Oh Really can't show up at a proper uniform And they're just like really what is he like a Uniform or Nazi or whatever you know and like no he's just like do it Because diving, like when you, I've never done that, but when you go through like the basic, do they do some kind of, Yeah, you do like, quite a lot of everything, but it's like, the big, the big, beautiful red dude. Oh yeah, things like whatever if we could get on like someone we were talking about like my first LPO Someone like Oh, it's like, that's like, like you said last time, I think I thought I was going to be a nom, like that day. but you know the officers like well, what's he like I'm like He's good to go that's all you need to know just stand the fuck by Don't have any fucking me He's from this this this The hunt that I'm going on I'm going with it's because that's like a It's like the the best possible hunt like Andy Andy stump He said that this He's like Yeah I just always remember like you know some mission whether it was overseas or no matter what I'd be like looking at it going I think it'd probably be good to do it like this Well, I thought about like doing it like good Not like what you're saying that's just junk and they're like but and then Cross training all the other guys on the sniper weapon Because sometimes You have to take a break and you got to give somebody else who's not a sniper then you can't shoot a gun I mean, it's easy but do more cross-training There's no reason that A non-sniper and a seal-potune shouldn't have a thousand rounds through whatever a weapon system we're using right now There's no reason maybe a thousand's a little bit, but That was a couple hundred this is no reason with that we're that busy, you know Getting up and going to work and like running around and talking about uniform standards and but we can't I mean come on We got all this time you have like no one shoot at you back here I'm like what do you mean I mean no fucking loose ends because he's gonna you know He's like a shock in the water like a smell buddy. Terrible I don't know how these one of these fuckers who've sitting cubicles like blow the brains out After like 10 years, you know the business suit and they're all like overweight and high blood brush We were in Australia working with the SDS and Shoot in the shit and We were we were doing some training or doing some shooting Our guys were doing really really well like shooting wise and Course with those cats who are awesome like the best guys out of you know just like a bunch of special forces around the world and but like even in the desert It's different than Like when I was when I when we would go to Fort Lewis Washington, or we'd go to Fort Chaffey Arkansas or like we'd go down to Panorge you ever go to one of the Training trips to Panama so Like patrolling through the woods patrolling through the water not Panama city Panama. You know, I loved it Because that's your job like yeah, and it was it was kind of a let down like it was like It's like you know there actually is not one move So asking Tony What the one piece of advice it's like Man like we're What is that where do you stick to guns probably is good? It wasn't like I mean first of all You and I were like if you and I looked at a target We would come up with a so we both have a plan that was like almost the same thing You know I you know You know, yeah, the whole reason to speak you know that story that you just told about me being hungry The reason this whole thing started with jocco is because when I was on Tim Ferriss's podcast I fasted that day and he was like well, you know, we've been talking for a long time You maybe we should go get something eat oil Okay, if you don't have someone give you some it's good it takes like I guess depends on who you are to me like six days for it to like really start That's only a couple days more than a cortisol shot though Really, yeah, right? You know, I was like, you know, I would look at it from, you know, be my wallet, look at it like, oh, Yeah, and people people can think I'm you know dreaming I'm not like we're gonna build this thing It is gonna be massive we're gonna bring back manufacturing to America and there's no one's gonna stop us That's what's gonna happen.
