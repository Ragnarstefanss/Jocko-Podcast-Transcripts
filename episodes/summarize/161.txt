I know this, you know, I know that this is how it works, but you've never been in the situation to recognize how it feels, you know, you know, so like training for war or whatever, like let's say in your case, where you would always, you say you try your best to make the training is realistic as possible. When you see, you know, some people, they're just sort of like that, you know, and they're, you know, it's almost like they can't see very far ahead of themselves or something like that. And I would think, you know, I'm just going off how I felt right there when you said that, you know, someone said to us unrealistic goal, especially for you, that includes you, you know, where like the failure of reaching that goal is kind of, you're partly your failure. It's like, codes, like, writing code, where if you kind of know the certain, like, general rules to things, you can start figuring out, you know? I'll have someone that's read and read and studied both those books, listen to every podcast and roll in and be like, hey, let's roll play this right here and be like, you know, put them in a scenario where where the right answer would be to say, hey, like, that's my fault. oh yeah, that makes sense, you know, but I think that I'm not sure if you read the whole thing, but it seems kind of even understated because like even when you study something, you're like, okay, I know what to do. If you're seeing it for the first time, just like we talked earlier about, if you see, if you know an arm lock is coming, if you know how to defend an arm lock, or you know what's coming, you at least know to pull your elbow in, right? Some weirdo on the street, you know, you want to go practice and learn and improve that you're like good with other good people, you know, other people who are trained. Like, and someone like Dean, who's like, I mean, Dean, that should, you know, but that's a thing. Kind of like the weather, remember how you were saying, like you kind of like extreme ownership, almost situation where it's not kind of, it is straight up. You know, I was like, oh, yeah, you know, like, cool. You know, the more I kind of open my eyes to like look at things, it kind of seems like playing the short game. He's bigger, but I could take him like, I know I can, but then you're like, wait, no, I don't know who that guy is. Like you know, if you're in bed and then you hear, I don't know, chicken outside or something or like a black hole air or something. But our, in Gigiitu, where, you know, the, you know, a young guy or whatever, he'll, he'll, or he'll have a certain body type or I don't know whatever he'll develop like this certain move. Everything that we're saying about how people can see what you're doing, he's recommending that you act this way but no one will know and you just have to pretend like you're actually a good person. Like when I talk to companies and I'll be talking to some leader and I'm like, Hey, here's what you need to say in a situation like this. And you can figure out, like, okay, when people in this happen inside this company, or this happen in this battle, people act this way, people act that way. And like people will be like, let's especially at work when people start setting goals all crazy. And he said over and over again before this that you know having the connection with the people and if the people are loyal like that's the most important thing. Kind of like, yeah, you know, because he knew he knows like, the submission hold is the fun part to learn. So being having good relationships with your people, making sure they understand where you're coming from, like, these things are not considered when you hear the word, but you don't know any better. The more you tell me the truth, the more I'm going to like it, the more I'm going to like you, outside of the easy should listen to no one. Do you think that those people that play a bad guy all the time when in real life they feel like everyone views me like I'm a jerk. Because you know, you know, some people just figure you like, oh, you can just squeeze me in there. I've got a friend that does high level security and they were going through like a high level briefing plan if in like a serious disaster scenario with a high paying client and he was basically had incorporated into the plan his own family. You'd see like a like a different one someone's like a bouncer, right? Well, then I thought what we were going like that is when you're good or no, like let's say you're an almond gold or not a fight. I believe when you stab someone in the back, that person they may die, but they got a friend, they got a brother, they got someone else, they got someone else that you don't know, you don't recognize and at some point they're going to come and get you. I'll kind of like, no one said anything like, Hey, when are we going to learn blah, blah, blah? Like Macievelli says in his book, not the one that you've heard about, but what he actually says guard yourself from flattery by demanding the truth, especially the truth from yourself and choose good people to be around you and set a good example by acting with courage and gravity and fortitude and study the art of war. And I don't know, these guys think they know everything, and now it's something we got to rebel you know, in our hands. And no get guys, you know, get guys and win tournaments and start winning tournaments and be like, and that instructs like, dang, this guy's killing these tournaments here. Or it feels like you didn't even wait because like if you, um, let's say you haven't done the digital in a long time or anything, you are correct when it comes to sports, but he's talking about actual going to war. I mean, that's, you know, that's a, the tactic technique, whatever, and like a lot of things like negotiation. I was like, hey, I just want to bring three people from my team and I'm like, oh, it's cool. And it's almost like I thought like, well, shoot, I didn't like, I didn't screw you over. But today, what I wanted to dig into a little bit is this term of Mackey Evelian and we covered his art of war book, which I had an interesting, I think it was a YouTube comment because I said, you know, art of war, Mackey Evelian, a colo Mackey Evelian and someone's like that was written by Sunsu idiot. But, but, but in a year, you're going to look up and be like, hey, I know that we got this opportunity. Like if you've got a good if your people support you, you can get attacked and you're going to drive that person off that attack you drive them off into disgrace. So you get people that have been doing this forever, like I just said, you got someone that hasn't really figured out if this new thing is going to work, and it's just a mismatch. You know, you know, even with like small stuff, big stuff small stuff, whatever one, everyone can see what you're doing, everyone.
