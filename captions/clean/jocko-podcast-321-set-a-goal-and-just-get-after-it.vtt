00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.74
This is Jockel podcast number 321 with echo Charles and me jockel will link good evening

2
00:00:05.74 --> 00:00:07.74
I got it evening

3
00:00:07.74 --> 00:00:09.74
so

4
00:00:09.74 --> 00:00:11.74
It's cold

5
00:00:12.24 --> 00:00:14.74
wet dark I

6
00:00:15.84 --> 00:00:17.84
Been awake for a few days

7
00:00:18.84 --> 00:00:21.18
19 years old it's hell week

8
00:00:22.40 --> 00:00:24.40
It's kind of crazy

9
00:00:24.40 --> 00:00:28.82
But I haven't found a bunch of people have quit and

10
00:00:30.60 --> 00:00:34.14
You do you have no idea who's going to quit

11
00:00:35.40 --> 00:00:40.48
My boat my boat crew leader quit who he was a prior-quitter so he had been

12
00:00:40.96 --> 00:00:42.40
Already been to Buds

13
00:00:42.40 --> 00:00:49.80
Bend to the fleet realize he didn't want to be in the fleet gone gone through the whole administrative regga marole to get back to Buds

14
00:00:50.76 --> 00:00:52.76
And he just quit

15
00:00:52.76 --> 00:00:55.38
watching people quit

16
00:00:56.10 --> 00:01:01.28
Is crazy they quit so fast you can't keep track of it. It's just it's just a mass

17
00:01:01.52 --> 00:01:07.60
Exodus and so what happens is your boat crew you're in a boat crew of six or seven guys organized by height

18
00:01:08.64 --> 00:01:15.38
Because you need to be roughly the same height to carry a boat on your head or a log on your shoulder if you got six or seven guys

19
00:01:15.38 --> 00:01:18.84
You gotta be around the same height so you're organized by height so as people quit

20
00:01:18.84 --> 00:01:24.72
You get less and less boat crews you keep lining up to a just who's in your boat crew

21
00:01:26.20 --> 00:01:28.20
But by

22
00:01:28.40 --> 00:01:34.16
By late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning things start to settle down meaning

23
00:01:34.76 --> 00:01:37.28
Most of the people that are going to quit have quit

24
00:01:38.28 --> 00:01:42.08
And so nice you who's left and it's again

25
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:46.88
You have no idea who is gonna quit and you got all kinds of different people tall

26
00:01:46.88 --> 00:01:50.16
Short stocky lean smart

27
00:01:51.92 --> 00:01:58.68
Some not so smart some introverts some extra votes. There's no stereotype. There's no stereotype. There's no stereotype

28
00:01:58.68 --> 00:02:03.28
There might be a public stereotype of what is heels, but it doesn't exist and actually in the seal teams

29
00:02:04.72 --> 00:02:12.28
You have no idea who's gonna make it only the big frog man in the sky knows who's gonna be a frog man down here on earth in my boat crew

30
00:02:13.24 --> 00:02:15.24
End up with some solid guys

31
00:02:15.24 --> 00:02:21.08
One of them is a quiet fellow from Kentucky and he's holding strong

32
00:02:21.92 --> 00:02:23.92
His name is Chris Gifford

33
00:02:25.92 --> 00:02:27.92
steady as a rock

34
00:02:28.56 --> 00:02:29.92
calm

35
00:02:29.92 --> 00:02:31.56
Stoic

36
00:02:31.56 --> 00:02:33.56
Solid

37
00:02:33.56 --> 00:02:35.56
And we kept battling

38
00:02:35.56 --> 00:02:40.60
And we made it through hell week and we both eventually got assigned to seal team one and

39
00:02:40.60 --> 00:02:44.84
And ended up having some pretty cool experiences together

40
00:02:46.04 --> 00:02:54.04
And he ended up with a career as a seal like me and a ton of lessons learned along the way and it's an honor to have him here

41
00:02:54.04 --> 00:02:59.92
With us tonight to talk about his experiences and share some of those lessons learned Chris

42
00:03:00.76 --> 00:03:04.68
Good to see you man. You too. Thanks for coming by. Thank you so much. This is a

43
00:03:04.68 --> 00:03:12.24
A bit surreal because I'm a big fan of the show and just to be here with with you and and Echo and and I talk about this stuff

44
00:03:12.24 --> 00:03:14.56
This is it's awesome. So thank you. Thank you for having me

45
00:03:15.32 --> 00:03:23.72
We're gonna get into Buds because I don't remember a lot of Buds and so I'm hoping you can fill in some holes along the way

46
00:03:24.12 --> 00:03:26.12
But before we get there

47
00:03:26.12 --> 00:03:29.12
Let's start out the beginning. What's started about where you came from?

48
00:03:29.12 --> 00:03:36.44
Yeah, so I grew up in Kentucky and Lexington which is you know kind of a college town and

49
00:03:38.72 --> 00:03:40.72
It was a

50
00:03:41.52 --> 00:03:44.96
Great place to grow up and it's still a great place today, but

51
00:03:45.52 --> 00:03:47.52
When I was in high school

52
00:03:47.52 --> 00:03:54.24
I wanted to leave. I was I was ready to leave. What would would your mom and dad do so my parents were divorced?

53
00:03:54.80 --> 00:03:56.80
my mom worked

54
00:03:56.80 --> 00:04:06.60
Later on she got remarried they owned a body shop so they ran that and then my father was in

55
00:04:08.56 --> 00:04:12.48
Not too far away in Louisville and he ran his own business

56
00:04:13.68 --> 00:04:15.68
did

57
00:04:15.68 --> 00:04:19.68
kind of answering service for people who I did

58
00:04:19.68 --> 00:04:26.48
Inspection's house inspection so they would call him he would set up the appointments and and then just

59
00:04:27.04 --> 00:04:29.04
Facts the appointments to them

60
00:04:29.92 --> 00:04:36.48
But who was more influential to me was probably my my best friends family and he was

61
00:04:37.84 --> 00:04:39.84
Mr. Hollywood great guy

62
00:04:40.40 --> 00:04:45.44
Still is today, but he was retired or not retired but he was in Vietnam

63
00:04:45.44 --> 00:04:51.28
In the army and just you know kind of an outdoors type person and

64
00:04:52.56 --> 00:04:53.84
was

65
00:04:53.84 --> 00:04:56.96
Real instrumental in helping you know me kind of

66
00:04:58.40 --> 00:05:07.32
Get into that outdoor you know not staying inside getting out and and being in nature more a big hunter

67
00:05:09.32 --> 00:05:11.32
Had a lot of

68
00:05:11.32 --> 00:05:16.60
Guns and stuff which made me more comfortable around it and all this stuff made a big difference later on

69
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:18.84
because you have being from Kentucky

70
00:05:19.16 --> 00:05:20.52
going to

71
00:05:20.52 --> 00:05:24.28
San Diego was it was a big change and I was pretty

72
00:05:24.68 --> 00:05:31.56
I've been early that I would have now if I remember right you did you or what you an electrician or something?

73
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:34.12
yeah, so the as I was

74
00:05:35.64 --> 00:05:37.64
wanting to go into the military

75
00:05:37.64 --> 00:05:47.24
When I was 14 my best friend and I went to golf port, Mississippi to visit his uncle who was a

76
00:05:47.96 --> 00:05:49.96
CB chief and

77
00:05:49.96 --> 00:05:51.96
We spent a week there with him

78
00:05:53.08 --> 00:05:58.36
And he was great he took us to the base kind of exposed us to all that and that's when I was like yeah

79
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:01.32
I think the Navy's a good way to get out of Kentucky. It's a good

80
00:06:01.32 --> 00:06:07.08
You know good environment this is the type of culture I want to be in and

81
00:06:08.36 --> 00:06:11.32
My best friend and I at the time were also

82
00:06:13.48 --> 00:06:16.60
Dive qualified so we had already been through like the patty open water

83
00:06:17.24 --> 00:06:22.44
He was my friend was big into that and so we kind of that was our hobby

84
00:06:22.84 --> 00:06:25.24
So we go down and golf port, Mississippi and

85
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:29.08
He takes us around and he said you know if you like

86
00:06:29.08 --> 00:06:33.32
Scooby-Diving you might want to look at the the seal teams and

87
00:06:33.72 --> 00:06:39.000
Where are the silt teams so he had the all hands magazine which was about the end so this is mid 80

88
00:06:39.96 --> 00:06:42.84
Which is the only information that that was out at the time and

89
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:48.52
We looked through it and it's like yeah, this the sounds cool. This is I think this would be good

90
00:06:49.40 --> 00:06:53.16
So we try to do my friend. I try to do as much research as we could and

91
00:06:53.16 --> 00:07:06.84
And we kind of determined that and you know and now in the Navy you'll call it a POA and am you kind of set up these milestones on how to get to to the target to go

92
00:07:07.72 --> 00:07:11.56
And I knew that at the time in order to

93
00:07:13.08 --> 00:07:17.24
Go to Buds and be a seal you first had to go to an A school

94
00:07:17.24 --> 00:07:22.60
So my thinking was okay if I got to do a trade and they had a list of the

95
00:07:23.40 --> 00:07:28.84
Different different source ratings that you could be to a to go to Buds

96
00:07:29.72 --> 00:07:32.84
I figured if I could learn this early then

97
00:07:34.36 --> 00:07:38.28
When I was in A school I could work out for and I could focus on going to Buds

98
00:07:38.92 --> 00:07:45.24
So my high school had a program to go to vocational school half of the day

99
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:49.32
So the first half you did your whatever required courses math English whatever

100
00:07:50.36 --> 00:07:55.80
And then the second half you left the campus went to a vocational school and you studied a trade and

101
00:07:56.60 --> 00:08:02.44
I chose electricity just because a lot of my family were in construction

102
00:08:03.16 --> 00:08:08.76
It was I would spend some summers working for my uncle says a plumber and I knew I didn't want to do that

103
00:08:09.24 --> 00:08:12.68
So electrical work was a lot easier well that wasn't easier but it was

104
00:08:12.68 --> 00:08:18.04
Cleaner cleaner yeah, I wasn't you know, it's keeping shut so it was

105
00:08:19.16 --> 00:08:21.80
I chose yeah electrical work and

106
00:08:22.92 --> 00:08:25.64
With the whole intent of just learning that

107
00:08:26.12 --> 00:08:29.32
So when I got to A school I didn't have to study as hard

108
00:08:29.32 --> 00:08:33.72
I could just go to the gym every night. What was in the all hands magazine?

109
00:08:33.72 --> 00:08:41.16
You know it just had just cool pictures but it kind of outlined you know this what you have to do to

110
00:08:43.48 --> 00:08:49.56
To go to Buds you I have to have so many pull ups so it's the time's on your runs your swims

111
00:08:52.20 --> 00:08:58.20
They talked about the source rating so it was all about just kind of how to get into a very little was about what they actually did

112
00:08:58.44 --> 00:09:00.44
Did you read any books like the

113
00:09:00.44 --> 00:09:06.60
There's a couple books that predated you and I go in the military going in the Navy

114
00:09:07.16 --> 00:09:09.48
Did you read any of those I didn't read any of them? No no I

115
00:09:10.68 --> 00:09:16.92
When I was in high school I was a mediocre student at best. I knew to join the Navy all I had to do was

116
00:09:17.64 --> 00:09:21.80
Was graduate with with a three point see and that's all

117
00:09:21.80 --> 00:09:29.48
I did did you do any athletics I did I was a runner and I ran distance and that was because I was you know

118
00:09:30.36 --> 00:09:34.20
Like I am now but you know very thin long legs and

119
00:09:34.68 --> 00:09:43.16
I think it was like 135 at the times what's distance so kind of distances so for track was to the two mile or

120
00:09:43.96 --> 00:09:48.12
Yeah, there's the two mile run the one mile run and the half mile or eight eighty

121
00:09:48.12 --> 00:09:54.68
So my high school it was mostly all sprinters and there were very few distance runners

122
00:09:55.24 --> 00:09:57.24
So it was good that

123
00:09:57.24 --> 00:10:03.56
The coach kind of left us alone and that's that's all I did was just go in and run

124
00:10:04.36 --> 00:10:08.40
miles and miles every day and so that that was

125
00:10:09.56 --> 00:10:12.44
kind of my strong point I did swim but

126
00:10:12.44 --> 00:10:18.76
I didn't do the type of swimming that I probably did to be competitive

127
00:10:18.76 --> 00:10:24.04
You know I think around my group of friends I was probably a very good swimmer and I think

128
00:10:24.68 --> 00:10:29.64
Compared to the general population today you were a good swimmer amongst your nine friends and move

129
00:10:29.64 --> 00:10:31.64
Oh Kentucky yeah

130
00:10:31.96 --> 00:10:36.52
So but running was running was was definitely my strong point so

131
00:10:37.24 --> 00:10:40.12
You get in the Navy what when you show up to buds

132
00:10:40.12 --> 00:10:44.52
What what was your thoughts when you when you showed up to buds?

133
00:10:45.08 --> 00:10:47.08
Well, I think

134
00:10:47.48 --> 00:10:51.64
By that time I felt pretty comfortable with with what

135
00:10:52.36 --> 00:10:57.72
How we were our how Buds went and a lot of that was because my best friend again

136
00:10:57.72 --> 00:11:00.68
We both wanted to go in the teams together, but he was a year ahead of me

137
00:11:01.16 --> 00:11:03.16
So he actually joined the Navy

138
00:11:03.64 --> 00:11:09.24
One year ahead and so he was kind of communicating with me how things were going and

139
00:11:09.24 --> 00:11:12.60
And when I was in a school

140
00:11:13.48 --> 00:11:16.68
I actually was here in San Diego so on the weekends

141
00:11:16.68 --> 00:11:19.08
I would take the bus over to Coronado

142
00:11:19.56 --> 00:11:23.48
Meet him and and you hang out with him and kind of get some inside

143
00:11:24.12 --> 00:11:30.04
But before that did he make it he did he did yeah, yeah, yeah, what's he what's he gonna go he went to STVs

144
00:11:30.44 --> 00:11:32.44
yeah, and

145
00:11:32.44 --> 00:11:34.44
that was

146
00:11:34.44 --> 00:11:39.72
He did one tour there and then he got out one into the police force and had it

147
00:11:40.28 --> 00:11:45.32
Still has a great career doing that so you had a good heads up as to what you're gonna be facing when you got to buds

148
00:11:45.32 --> 00:11:48.28
I did and that year while he was gone

149
00:11:48.52 --> 00:11:55.80
I was just so focused on what I needed to do and I think one of the issues that I had

150
00:11:56.04 --> 00:12:00.92
Get out was a good runner a decent swimmer, but I'd never lifted weights before and I

151
00:12:01.56 --> 00:12:03.56
Didn't even know where to start or

152
00:12:03.56 --> 00:12:11.24
Or definitely I would have hurt myself so I went to the YMCA and I met a

153
00:12:14.20 --> 00:12:19.40
Former Kentucky football star Cisco Bryant coach Bryant and just

154
00:12:20.12 --> 00:12:25.000
Winning and said look and again 135 pounds 16 years old

155
00:12:25.64 --> 00:12:29.24
I said I want to be a seal and he's like huh and

156
00:12:29.24 --> 00:12:37.32
And I said you know here's my strong points, but I don't have any weight training or anything and he

157
00:12:37.96 --> 00:12:41.88
Mintered me for that year. I would go you know every day that I could and

158
00:12:42.76 --> 00:12:48.20
He worked with me and if anything he kept me from getting hurt which I think a lot of

159
00:12:48.60 --> 00:12:53.08
Kids trying to go today, you know, they they just push it too hard and get hurt before they even go

160
00:12:53.72 --> 00:12:58.36
But but he was he was a good mentor to me and got me kind of that

161
00:12:58.36 --> 00:13:04.68
More comfortable with my body my weight and to be able to handle that so I felt pretty good

162
00:13:05.08 --> 00:13:08.52
Going to buds that and you were good on pull ups pushups dips

163
00:13:08.84 --> 00:13:16.28
Yeah, and he's and rope climbs and all that yeah, yeah, he's the one who kind of worked with me on that and put me on a good program to

164
00:13:17.72 --> 00:13:22.20
To be able to at least again make make the markers and you know back then

165
00:13:22.20 --> 00:13:30.76
Not a lot of people knew about them buds so really all you had to do was you know meet meet the minimum you weren't

166
00:13:31.24 --> 00:13:35.88
Trying to outperform at that time and I remember doing one of the

167
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:38.76
Test I think it was the test right before you class up

168
00:13:39.72 --> 00:13:45.72
You know they were like I ate pull ups and you know they're trying to get everybody through once you did your age or like I hop down next

169
00:13:46.04 --> 00:13:48.36
And they were just trying to finish the name and care. Yeah, you know

170
00:13:48.36 --> 00:13:53.96
It was just trying to yeah if you were ready to class up and you met the test then you were ready to go

171
00:13:53.96 --> 00:13:57.48
They weren't not really competing. I got a confession to make

172
00:13:58.12 --> 00:14:02.36
He just maybe think of this and I and I feel like a

173
00:14:03.48 --> 00:14:05.000
Dick so

174
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.04
There was a guy remember we had to do that class up test and

175
00:14:08.92 --> 00:14:11.56
You you count your buddies reps and

176
00:14:11.56 --> 00:14:18.04
And my buddy who I know exactly who it is because he ended up making it on sit ups

177
00:14:18.76 --> 00:14:24.52
He didn't he was shy the number I didn't know him at the time and you know

178
00:14:24.52 --> 00:14:29.08
I think you had to do 75 sit ups or something like this and he did like 68

179
00:14:30.36 --> 00:14:36.36
Maybe he even did like 72 like for time or something you have two minutes. Okay, you have to do it's run

180
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:39.72
swim or it's actually swim run pull ups

181
00:14:39.72 --> 00:14:45.72
Sit ups push ups something like that good minimum numbers like you said Chris

182
00:14:45.72 --> 00:14:49.80
That the minimum for Paul so it was like eight yeah, but that's it you do eight okay

183
00:14:49.80 --> 00:14:55.32
You're good you're going in the class this guy who who I end up I know him like later on

184
00:14:55.32 --> 00:14:58.20
I know him he's a great guy is a good guy is a great team guy blah blah blah blah

185
00:14:58.60 --> 00:15:04.92
He did like 70 shy of the sit ups and instructor came over like what was his number and I'm like

186
00:15:05.32 --> 00:15:07.32
71 fail

187
00:15:07.32 --> 00:15:10.12
You got such an asshole

188
00:15:10.12 --> 00:15:18.20
I feel bad dude, you know, but at the time you and also at that time it was like you didn't know who is making it you didn't and

189
00:15:19.32 --> 00:15:23.80
I don't think we had really had that attitude because I think you get into an attitude of the class

190
00:15:23.80 --> 00:15:27.72
Like you got to help your friends out like help your buddy and we weren't there yet because we were just hey

191
00:15:27.72 --> 00:15:31.000
Are we gonna class up and so I just and I also have like a

192
00:15:31.56 --> 00:15:35.40
cold blooded streak of honesty and it's hard for me to lie about shit

193
00:15:35.40 --> 00:15:40.84
And I actually had one person double on time you're incapable of lying like probably pretty close

194
00:15:40.84 --> 00:15:45.72
So the instructor asked me about 71 they're like fail cool. Sorry bro

195
00:15:46.28 --> 00:15:53.64
Yeah, well that yeah that reminds me of when I first got two buds so I think when I got there

196
00:15:54.28 --> 00:15:59.80
The class before it's just classed up so everyone that was waiting in that fourth phase or whatever that pre-training phase

197
00:15:59.80 --> 00:16:06.52
They had all left for the class so there was but there was a handful of people that were kind of hanging around and there was kind of a

198
00:16:07.16 --> 00:16:13.80
There were a couple of people that kind of felt that stayed in that limbo at pergatory for way too long

199
00:16:14.92 --> 00:16:21.28
And whether you know they they're like I'm not ready to class up so you know maybe they wouldn't do as many of the

200
00:16:21.28 --> 00:16:23.28
Pro's just because you had orders there

201
00:16:23.88 --> 00:16:28.04
It costs way too much to send you someplace else so if you kind of

202
00:16:28.04 --> 00:16:31.56
You know you could you could stay in fourth phase for months

203
00:16:32.12 --> 00:16:38.64
You know maybe even a year but too too long but your clock doesn't start until you class up

204
00:16:38.64 --> 00:16:41.64
So there's really no reason to stay in fourth phase and

205
00:16:42.72 --> 00:16:45.08
Because you're you're just never gonna go anywhere so

206
00:16:45.72 --> 00:16:49.60
But but I show up and there's not a whole lot of people there and

207
00:16:50.60 --> 00:16:56.60
I get a room and meet my roommate and up being my swim buddy great guy and

208
00:16:56.60 --> 00:17:05.40
And it was like a Friday. It was the first day or first day I had just gotten all my uniforms and I and they would have a schedule

209
00:17:05.40 --> 00:17:06.40
so

210
00:17:06.40 --> 00:17:13.16
You're around the other the actual classes, but they would meet at morning for PT and they would do something

211
00:17:13.16 --> 00:17:15.88
But then they'd say okay come back on the beach and we're just gonna do

212
00:17:17.44 --> 00:17:22.84
Surf passage and just practice going in out the water. There's no time. There's no limit nobody's watching you

213
00:17:22.84 --> 00:17:25.56
It's just just you just go out and do it or you know

214
00:17:25.56 --> 00:17:31.32
We're gonna do a run or go to the pool or something so this day there they're they're doing surf passage and this was

215
00:17:32.52 --> 00:17:36.96
I guess it was March so the waves were were pretty good there and

216
00:17:38.68 --> 00:17:43.32
So being from Kentucky didn't grow up around the ocean. I wasn't you know surf or anything

217
00:17:43.32 --> 00:17:49.36
I got my ass hammered you know we had those duck feet that they're weighed a ton and

218
00:17:50.48 --> 00:17:54.76
Yeah, I put them on and get out in the waves. I get knocked down

219
00:17:54.76 --> 00:18:01.76
I get up. I'm trying to swim out and I'm trying to swim over the waves and I'm just getting push push right back into the

220
00:18:02.08 --> 00:18:05.84
To the beach and this happened you know it was the whole time

221
00:18:05.84 --> 00:18:10.44
So the two hours of whatever you're doing it and I get back to the room that I am like

222
00:18:10.92 --> 00:18:15.24
How can I be a seal if I can even get through the surf zone? This is ridiculous

223
00:18:15.56 --> 00:18:20.66
So I talked to my roommate who was I think he was from California or from a coastal state

224
00:18:20.66 --> 00:18:27.82
He's like dude no worry about what we'll go out this weekend. I'll teach you and he did he took me out and taught me how to dive

225
00:18:27.82 --> 00:18:30.54
Under the water and like hell and just get through and

226
00:18:31.62 --> 00:18:37.78
That was kind of my first experience of this is this is what a team does you know when somebody has an issue

227
00:18:38.78 --> 00:18:41.70
a buddy who has a little bit of knowledge says hey, you know

228
00:18:41.70 --> 00:18:43.70
I can help you out

229
00:18:43.70 --> 00:18:46.000
You didn't get the introduction of the teams from me

230
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.32
Your stroke and your sit-ups. I cut into that dude

231
00:18:51.88 --> 00:18:56.68
So you and I you and I brought what are you six feet?

232
00:18:57.40 --> 00:19:04.92
11 yeah, so I'm 5 11 too because I remember we got we got linked up together pretty quick because we're literally the same height and

233
00:19:07.36 --> 00:19:13.76
That means even and I don't know if we do we mess with boats and stuff in fourth phase. I don't think we did if if

234
00:19:13.76 --> 00:19:18.24
Anything it was just kind of an introductory thing like here's how you put on your head

235
00:19:18.24 --> 00:19:25.64
Here's how we looked it up, but it was mostly it was just kind of PT type stuff physical just general training and then

236
00:19:26.60 --> 00:19:28.60
Then we roll into

237
00:19:28.88 --> 00:19:30.88
first phase

238
00:19:30.88 --> 00:19:32.88
Would you think of that?

239
00:19:32.88 --> 00:19:38.12
You know again, I was kind of a small guy, but I didn't require a lot of maintenance

240
00:19:38.24 --> 00:19:42.64
Which was nice because you low maintenance because the big guys I remember

241
00:19:42.64 --> 00:19:45.20
Being on the O course is was right at the beginning

242
00:19:45.72 --> 00:19:48.92
I don't if you remember this, but we had a big guy

243
00:19:48.92 --> 00:19:53.56
Exactly talking about and he was awesome. I mean and he was a good guy every loved him

244
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.88
Everyone loved him. He was a good runner. He was awesome swimmer. I think it was a collegiate swimmer and

245
00:19:59.44 --> 00:20:05.84
just but he was you know what you would think a seal look like and we're on the O course and

246
00:20:07.88 --> 00:20:12.60
You know we were all lined up and you everyone just kind of goes and it wasn't like a time thing

247
00:20:12.60 --> 00:20:18.84
You know you just did the did the loop a couple of times just to practice you know you that your techniques

248
00:20:19.72 --> 00:20:24.96
And I remember this guy got to like the third obstacle which was the high-o the high wall

249
00:20:25.20 --> 00:20:27.20
So it's a wall that's probably

250
00:20:28.20 --> 00:20:32.88
12 feet tall and there's a rope on it and you climb the rope like Batman

251
00:20:33.12 --> 00:20:37.04
You know you hold the rope and you put your feet on the wall. You kind of walk up the wall

252
00:20:37.04 --> 00:20:39.60
You and then you get to the top you flip through the side and you drop down

253
00:20:39.60 --> 00:20:44.92
I do not remember that this is one of the few things I remember for the thoughts is this evolution right here

254
00:20:44.92 --> 00:20:50.68
And watching that guy his forms gave out his forms got it because he couldn't he couldn't pull himself up the rope and

255
00:20:51.20 --> 00:20:52.20
You know

256
00:20:52.20 --> 00:20:58.60
Guys were kind of passing him through and he spent he spent the whole evolution on that wall and

257
00:20:59.32 --> 00:21:03.30
We're you know the students that were done were over there

258
00:21:03.30 --> 00:21:08.82
Charney mom the instructors were chairman and they were like get over the wall get over the wall and

259
00:21:10.02 --> 00:21:13.42
But he never made it over the wall and they they dropped him

260
00:21:14.22 --> 00:21:19.66
Performance dropped so oh that was a performance drop I think so but now that yeah

261
00:21:19.66 --> 00:21:23.66
Yeah, it might be what you remember it might have been a I don't know if it's a DOR or if it's a performance

262
00:21:23.66 --> 00:21:27.94
I don't need there, but again, but that it was kind of another realization of

263
00:21:27.94 --> 00:21:34.58
You know, you don't know who's gonna make it through do you remember how many people we classed up with so the number that I

264
00:21:34.90 --> 00:21:38.74
Remember and I don't have any real evidence to this it was about

265
00:21:39.06 --> 00:21:42.30
116 or some somewhere a little for 100 really

266
00:21:42.34 --> 00:21:48.10
That's what I remember but yeah, who knows I don't remember much

267
00:21:48.10 --> 00:21:54.70
I remember losing a guy in the on the first PT of the first day and we are on the grinder

268
00:21:54.70 --> 00:22:02.70
Yeah, they're posing a stone and we got wet a couple of times and he turned his ankle or at least

269
00:22:03.10 --> 00:22:05.10
And he did

270
00:22:07.50 --> 00:22:14.18
And they're like yeah, of course yelling I mean it's the first day of butts and they were yelling at him and he you know when over and

271
00:22:15.50 --> 00:22:17.50
Inquit, but

272
00:22:17.50 --> 00:22:22.10
Yeah, I remember losing and then we we lost people for performance

273
00:22:22.10 --> 00:22:25.30
I don't think he was safety you know a couple of weeks before graduation

274
00:22:25.30 --> 00:22:30.18
We're on the island, but but you know you mentioned at the opening about the

275
00:22:30.90 --> 00:22:35.06
About the Bokeh leader and I remember that like it was yesterday

276
00:22:35.06 --> 00:22:37.54
We it was we're getting ready to do

277
00:22:38.54 --> 00:22:40.50
night rock ported rock ported

278
00:22:40.50 --> 00:22:43.18
Yeah, and they bring everybody into the

279
00:22:44.18 --> 00:22:48.58
Into the classroom to give us the brief and it was looking bad out there

280
00:22:48.58 --> 00:22:54.26
So this you know is probably April May you know the winds were high the waves were we're going up

281
00:22:54.26 --> 00:22:57.62
And we we're just kind of sitting in there. You can hear the wind howling outside

282
00:22:58.34 --> 00:23:02.74
And one of the instructors comes in he's like oh man this this is gonna be this gonna be ugly

283
00:23:03.70 --> 00:23:07.70
And this was before they had guys wear helmets right because it's easier now

284
00:23:07.86 --> 00:23:12.26
But they all they're like you know make sure you're wearing your head your hat

285
00:23:12.26 --> 00:23:14.88
So if your head matches against rock it'll

286
00:23:14.88 --> 00:23:22.04
Your brains and it'll soak up the blood and they're just going on so they come in give the brief and it's yeah

287
00:23:22.04 --> 00:23:26.64
It's looking bad out there. Yeah, they're just they're just talking it up and like I

288
00:23:26.92 --> 00:23:31.64
Get to your boats so we all run outside and we add people quick just bang bang bang

289
00:23:31.64 --> 00:23:34.80
And I remember this the way I remember

290
00:23:35.40 --> 00:23:38.48
Our boat crew leader comes up and goes who's the next in charge and

291
00:23:38.80 --> 00:23:40.80
It was one one of the other guys and

292
00:23:40.80 --> 00:23:45.84
And he hands him his paddle and he goes I'm fallen by the waist. Yep, that's the exact quote

293
00:23:46.40 --> 00:23:52.84
That's the exact quote. I see exact quote that that dude said and I remember you you guys were good friends

294
00:23:52.84 --> 00:23:54.84
I think I was his roommate

295
00:23:54.84 --> 00:23:56.84
I was almost a positive house was roommate and

296
00:23:57.72 --> 00:24:02.72
You know we were all at first friend. Come on man. You know stay in there stay in there at first I go

297
00:24:02.72 --> 00:24:06.54
I go what I got to understand what he was doing like I'm falling by the way

298
00:24:06.54 --> 00:24:10.56
It was this mean like are you're freaking up a different position on the boat you're gonna you're gonna paddle from over here

299
00:24:10.56 --> 00:24:16.28
I didn't know what the fucking talking about and so I think I literally said like what are you talking about?

300
00:24:16.44 --> 00:24:20.84
What are you trying to say yeah? Yeah, and and we were all kind of like

301
00:24:21.16 --> 00:24:25.02
And then Jaco terms and like all right see you later and just walked off

302
00:24:25.92 --> 00:24:27.92
We're all looking at like

303
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:28.92
See you later

304
00:24:28.92 --> 00:24:33.000
Walked off and yeah, and the evolution wasn't that bad. Well, not bad

305
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.46
What do that you got sucked in he freaking rang out we also had another guy that was a stud

306
00:24:40.12 --> 00:24:43.84
That was like all the instructors loved him. He was kind of a jacked guy

307
00:24:44.46 --> 00:24:49.80
He was from the northeast and I remember he quit and it was like

308
00:24:50.08 --> 00:24:55.30
Dang I mean he was a stud he was doing great at everything. It's just a stud and you're and you're just thinking

309
00:24:55.30 --> 00:24:57.30
What is wrong with these people?

310
00:24:57.30 --> 00:25:04.94
Which is a really accused of to everything it's not for everybody the programs not for everybody I understand that it is very here's the strange thing

311
00:25:05.28 --> 00:25:06.56
you

312
00:25:06.56 --> 00:25:07.56
You

313
00:25:07.56 --> 00:25:14.80
Research about this thing this job you enlist in the navy for six years of your life

314
00:25:15.06 --> 00:25:18.04
You sign the dotted line for six years of your life

315
00:25:18.28 --> 00:25:23.34
You train you wake up early you swim you do all these things and then first night of a week you just got on the house

316
00:25:23.34 --> 00:25:25.34
I was wrong a hair mouth

317
00:25:25.34 --> 00:25:31.18
Like that's a lot of investment for zero return on the return on that investment. Yeah

318
00:25:35.18 --> 00:25:37.18
Hell week

319
00:25:37.18 --> 00:25:39.98
Did you remember did you have any hallucinations?

320
00:25:40.78 --> 00:25:46.42
Yeah, when on the on the long paddles the just kind of seeing stuff in the water

321
00:25:47.14 --> 00:25:48.14
the

322
00:25:48.14 --> 00:25:59.02
Some lights and stuff but nothing as bad as some others. Yeah, I saw a couple traffic lights out in the middle of the ocean and I knew I was hallucinating

323
00:25:59.02 --> 00:26:02.86
I was thinking oh, there's a traffic light, but that's obviously not right because we're in the middle of the ocean

324
00:26:03.26 --> 00:26:07.34
We all one of the clearest memories I have is one of the guys in our boat crew

325
00:26:07.50 --> 00:26:13.66
Who's nickname ended up being chat in the teams who is my swim buddy he was your swim buddy. He swore

326
00:26:13.66 --> 00:26:18.22
He was swearing saying swear words for like a half an hour

327
00:26:19.46 --> 00:26:21.58
And just remember thinking dude

328
00:26:21.74 --> 00:26:25.26
This dude is coming up with some creative birds right now

329
00:26:25.26 --> 00:26:31.06
He was just swearing for like a half an hour. You so mad about everything and he was just

330
00:26:31.34 --> 00:26:37.92
Dropping F balls man. It was freaking hilarious hilarious. Yeah, yeah, now he would and such a great guy again

331
00:26:37.92 --> 00:26:40.56
I mean he helped me in so many ways

332
00:26:40.56 --> 00:26:48.80
Another thing was I was a good swimmer, but swimming in the open ocean was was not my thing

333
00:26:49.44 --> 00:26:54.44
Farmed boy from Kentucky so but he was good at guiding and

334
00:26:56.84 --> 00:27:02.96
He helped me a lot of times because when I was guiding I was all over the place and there were

335
00:27:02.96 --> 00:27:09.84
A couple of times where you know the instructors were counting down you know 30 29 and we're just

336
00:27:10.88 --> 00:27:14.88
You know doing everything we can to to make the time and

337
00:27:16.04 --> 00:27:22.04
And again, it was largely due to just my inability to swim swim straight, but

338
00:27:23.24 --> 00:27:26.28
We never failed anything, but yeah, there was a couple of times

339
00:27:26.92 --> 00:27:29.32
Yeah, I failed a swim my

340
00:27:29.32 --> 00:27:34.36
Swim buddy obviously I'm not gonna say his name so we failed a swim and it was a swim that a bunch of

341
00:27:34.92 --> 00:27:36.60
Paris failed

342
00:27:36.60 --> 00:27:41.04
So we all lined up now was this like a time yep

343
00:27:41.04 --> 00:27:43.80
It was a time swim sometime in first phase. It wasn't like a

344
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:51.24
Conditioning where they're like all you fail no, but a lot of us failed. Yeah, like there was probably a current or something whatever

345
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.64
So we fail and this particular who is in our boat crew by the way and you know who it is

346
00:27:57.64 --> 00:28:02.92
But so we're standing in swim pairs and they're calling us in the first phase office to explain why we failed

347
00:28:03.64 --> 00:28:06.64
And this guy this guy we walk in and

348
00:28:07.36 --> 00:28:09.36
The instructors are like

349
00:28:09.36 --> 00:28:14.36
You know, why do you guys fail and no shit my swim buddy goes willing can't guide

350
00:28:16.12 --> 00:28:21.60
And the funny thing was I was actually I was actually good at guiding and I wasn't a horrible swimmer and

351
00:28:21.60 --> 00:28:29.16
And I just couldn't I was in a state of shock and I was like I guess not and what we ended up doing as a class is we split up between

352
00:28:29.76 --> 00:28:34.92
They gave us to remember the good swimmers so they're like okay, you know willing you suck and

353
00:28:34.92 --> 00:28:38.60
They put me with another guy and they put the other guy with another guy. Well, I passed the next swim

354
00:28:38.60 --> 00:28:43.58
He failed the next one because he was slow, but he blamed it on for good oil willing over here

355
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:46.08
That was the first that's like the first

356
00:28:46.08 --> 00:28:54.48
In the first memory I have of somebody just not taking ownership and how totally jacked up the woods and I was thinking even the instructors

357
00:28:54.48 --> 00:28:57.12
I could see the instructors they

358
00:28:57.72 --> 00:29:02.56
They didn't look like oh well, what's wrong with you? Well, like they looked at him like oh you're a you're a dirt bag

359
00:29:02.56 --> 00:29:05.20
They I could feel that from them so

360
00:29:06.20 --> 00:29:11.04
Oddly enough what did you have was there anything that was hard for you in butts?

361
00:29:12.96 --> 00:29:14.96
I wouldn't say

362
00:29:14.96 --> 00:29:18.36
Like hard, but but again, I didn't win anything

363
00:29:18.36 --> 00:29:20.96
I didn't lose anything. I was right in the middle

364
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:23.68
If there was anything that came

365
00:29:24.68 --> 00:29:27.32
Easier to me was just the running just because I

366
00:29:27.72 --> 00:29:31.12
Spent so many years running I had and I had the body for it

367
00:29:32.04 --> 00:29:37.76
That wasn't an issue. I didn't really get I mean I got cold as everyone did but

368
00:29:38.60 --> 00:29:40.60
But yeah, I

369
00:29:40.60 --> 00:29:42.60
For dive phase

370
00:29:42.60 --> 00:29:48.44
Um, I know issues, but I was comfortable in the water. I was already a super cool cop first time. Yeah, I

371
00:29:49.56 --> 00:29:56.46
Feel book I do remember when we had life saving and and I you know

372
00:29:56.46 --> 00:29:57.46
I was

373
00:29:57.46 --> 00:30:03.46
Train life guards so I felt pretty comfortable with that and I got one of the instructors who was

374
00:30:04.92 --> 00:30:06.92
Of shorter stature

375
00:30:06.92 --> 00:30:11.14
And I was like okay, well, I should be able to handle this

376
00:30:11.14 --> 00:30:16.86
I don't know if you had a weight belt on or just whatever, but man, he woke my ass in the pool and

377
00:30:17.86 --> 00:30:22.86
It was I think it was right before they started grading us and

378
00:30:23.86 --> 00:30:31.38
It really kind of shook my confidence a little bit and but I I didn't have doing okay, but but yeah

379
00:30:31.38 --> 00:30:37.02
I mean sometimes sometimes you get that you just get the the bad draw and especially on pool comp

380
00:30:37.38 --> 00:30:40.70
You know if you got it somebody who's kind of watching force

381
00:30:40.70 --> 00:30:42.70
You know, it's like did you do 71

382
00:30:43.90 --> 00:30:45.90
I

383
00:30:45.90 --> 00:30:49.10
Yeah, I feel pool comp and I didn't even go past the first

384
00:30:50.54 --> 00:30:52.54
The first thing where they rip your mask off

385
00:30:52.70 --> 00:30:58.22
He ripped my mask off and he started just doing he started going up getting a breath coming back down knock knock

386
00:30:58.22 --> 00:31:01.22
I'm a regulator out go up get a breath come back down knock my regulator

387
00:31:01.22 --> 00:31:06.62
So I didn't get a breath and I was down there for 17 minutes and I just sat there like kept putting it back in kept going to do in the procedures

388
00:31:06.62 --> 00:31:10.78
And then after 17 minutes he literally did I sat there on my knees

389
00:31:11.98 --> 00:31:16.80
For 17 minutes and all he did was knock my regulator out come back down knock my regulator out come back down

390
00:31:16.80 --> 00:31:18.80
And I kept put it back

391
00:31:18.80 --> 00:31:21.80
I'd get like half a breath boom. It was going again

392
00:31:22.46 --> 00:31:26.78
So and then after 17 minutes he came back down gave me this gave me the signal to come up

393
00:31:27.34 --> 00:31:32.90
And I come up and I wasn't even stressed I was like so I come up and he goes you failed

394
00:31:32.90 --> 00:31:36.58
You didn't look comfortable on there and I was like who y'all instructor and

395
00:31:38.10 --> 00:31:42.46
Anyways, I had not become in friends with him later in the teams and he's like oh, yeah

396
00:31:42.46 --> 00:31:45.86
I remember those guys just fucking me there but I was like oh great. You know I

397
00:31:46.10 --> 00:31:48.10
My life

398
00:31:48.82 --> 00:31:54.82
So yeah, you get messed with sometimes. That's the way it works. Yeah, yeah, I had never was a buddhist structure

399
00:31:54.82 --> 00:31:59.46
I don't you know know if that's part of the program or something see how you handle failure

400
00:31:59.46 --> 00:32:01.46
I don't know but

401
00:32:01.46 --> 00:32:08.86
Yeah, it's it's kind of a weird dynamic and but that school is you know the way it's run is is phenomenal

402
00:32:09.10 --> 00:32:14.98
I mean it's a science and they they do they do good work. It's kind of crazy. Yeah. It's a crazy thing

403
00:32:15.14 --> 00:32:17.14
It's a crazy thing

404
00:32:17.14 --> 00:32:18.82
because

405
00:32:18.82 --> 00:32:26.06
You would not think that 80% of the people that show up to that that have enlisted in the military

406
00:32:26.06 --> 00:32:32.54
That have gone through screening tests that have trained that have told their friends and family. I'm gonna be a seal

407
00:32:32.54 --> 00:32:40.70
You wouldn't think that 80% of those people in that category would quit you wouldn't think it and they do

408
00:32:41.98 --> 00:32:46.06
It's some crazy times crazy times all right, so

409
00:32:47.22 --> 00:32:48.72
We get done

410
00:32:48.72 --> 00:32:53.66
Sancle man. Well, how many guys we lose the Sancle man out not not too many but there were a couple of guys

411
00:32:53.66 --> 00:33:00.42
One in particular that was in our boat crew. Oh, yeah, I got a safety violation. Yes, and that's the very guy

412
00:33:00.86 --> 00:33:03.74
That called me out as being

413
00:33:03.74 --> 00:33:07.14
Interesting, so I think he was getting tracked the whole time. I do too

414
00:33:07.14 --> 00:33:13.38
I think he was getting tracked because I think they just thought this guy's not a team player and we don't want him in the teams. It's interesting

415
00:33:13.38 --> 00:33:16.38
Yeah, I know that. Yeah, that's the very same guy. I'm excited

416
00:33:17.30 --> 00:33:22.30
We also lost an officer out there. Yeah, and he was a really good guy. He was he was

417
00:33:22.30 --> 00:33:24.30
Where were we in the same

418
00:33:24.82 --> 00:33:27.30
boat crew on the island because they moved people around

419
00:33:28.38 --> 00:33:32.26
Not sure if we were but yeah, he was my officer my

420
00:33:32.78 --> 00:33:38.90
Platoon element. He wasn't mine. So we were different. I had a different one and he was mine and I remember before we went to the island

421
00:33:39.58 --> 00:33:41.58
we our

422
00:33:41.58 --> 00:33:45.50
kind of platoon all met at a pizza place together and

423
00:33:47.46 --> 00:33:50.14
You know, he talked about what was coming up and

424
00:33:50.14 --> 00:33:57.14
And I even had our spouses there and stuff. I mean, it was something like you would do and the teams and

425
00:33:58.50 --> 00:34:01.54
We get out there and they got him on something

426
00:34:01.54 --> 00:34:06.58
It was so stupid. It was a weapons test. Yeah, not a shoot-in-a-demic

427
00:34:06.58 --> 00:34:10.34
Like it's like a damage weapon test. There was something going on there

428
00:34:10.34 --> 00:34:14.82
He made somebody mad or something like that. I think yeah, because I believe I talked to him

429
00:34:14.82 --> 00:34:22.10
Like soon after that and he kind of indicated that there was some past on the officer

430
00:34:22.38 --> 00:34:27.34
Side I'm not sure if he was from the gathering or not, but he wasn't he wasn't from the gathering

431
00:34:27.34 --> 00:34:32.26
Yeah, there was something that something there that that didn't work out and it was unfortunate

432
00:34:32.26 --> 00:34:38.38
Yes, I mean what little time we were with him. I think he would made an awesome officer. That's the that's the

433
00:34:38.86 --> 00:34:43.94
Hard part about having a certain level of subjectivity in the training

434
00:34:43.94 --> 00:34:47.94
Which there's let there is less of it now is yeah, there's less of that subjectivity

435
00:34:48.58 --> 00:34:54.06
When we went through it was it was very subjective and in many cases that was the right thing

436
00:34:54.22 --> 00:34:59.10
Because a team guy and structures looking at a guy saying I don't really want this guy and I'll tune with me

437
00:34:59.10 --> 00:35:01.10
Which is the ultimate test

438
00:35:01.86 --> 00:35:06.82
Now there's a great trick that one of the master chiefs played on the instructors at one point

439
00:35:07.46 --> 00:35:09.46
one of the master chiefs who you know, but

440
00:35:09.46 --> 00:35:16.34
He he was running buds and he brought all the instructors into a room and was said, you know, hey

441
00:35:16.74 --> 00:35:19.98
I do things you know we should we should make this

442
00:35:20.62 --> 00:35:24.90
You know make sure it's hard as it can be and set the standards and everyone's like yeah

443
00:35:24.90 --> 00:35:27.14
Yeah, and say so okay, what about the run times?

444
00:35:27.14 --> 00:35:34.98
What should we make it guys are chip and down the run times chip and down this one times chip and down all these things and then they get done with this new model of buds

445
00:35:34.98 --> 00:35:40.86
And then he pulls out a stack of records and it's all the instructor's records and he and he says

446
00:35:40.98 --> 00:35:45.46
None of you would be in the teams and he was right, you know, you can only be so hard

447
00:35:45.46 --> 00:35:50.54
So that subjectivity I think it's less now. I believe it's less now

448
00:35:50.78 --> 00:35:56.94
But it had a benefit and it had some negatives because the benefit is if a guy really didn't block us look you can be a tough guy

449
00:35:57.34 --> 00:36:03.50
You can just be a knuckle dragger like oh, I'm not gonna quit that that does happen guys just not gonna quit

450
00:36:03.50 --> 00:36:07.58
They're just tough, but they don't belong in the teams and they could they would get rid of that guy

451
00:36:07.82 --> 00:36:14.58
But occasion you get a guy like that officer who was a good guy, but I mean we did we we spent a lot of time with him

452
00:36:14.58 --> 00:36:17.30
And he was a good guy and for whatever reason

453
00:36:17.90 --> 00:36:22.94
Rub somebody the wrong way and that was that but by yeah

454
00:36:23.50 --> 00:36:27.34
Freaking rough. I'll be went on to do great things. I'm sure you did. I'm sure you did

455
00:36:27.66 --> 00:36:32.74
So you and I both get orders to seal team one. Did you request did you request West Coast?

456
00:36:32.74 --> 00:36:38.66
No, so really so that you fill out your dream sheet. Yeah, which I think is pretty worthless

457
00:36:39.30 --> 00:36:43.10
But was for you. We're so I dream all day long. She's like team one baby

458
00:36:43.42 --> 00:36:49.10
It was literally my first choice. Well, I'd be interested see how they how they did the you know the division

459
00:36:49.10 --> 00:36:52.90
But so my best friend who again I grew up with

460
00:36:53.26 --> 00:36:57.54
Both always planned to put in for STV. I did I want to go to you

461
00:36:57.54 --> 00:37:04.46
Me person that put it for us TV so on that so I put you had three choices my first choice

462
00:37:04.46 --> 00:37:07.10
I think I put like silti made or silti

463
00:37:07.10 --> 00:37:12.54
You know it was an East Coast team, but my third choice. I will go to STVs on on the East Coast

464
00:37:12.74 --> 00:37:17.98
Just because that's where I wanted to go. I get silti one. That's crazy

465
00:37:18.98 --> 00:37:25.18
Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, I'm sure it was just you know needs of the Navy as I've learned throughout my career

466
00:37:25.18 --> 00:37:31.38
That that you that will come first and I'm sure they had numbers that they needed and I don't again

467
00:37:31.38 --> 00:37:36.10
I don't know how things got to be because we had almost half our class go to the East Coast

468
00:37:36.10 --> 00:37:41.14
It was kind of half and half our class. It was kind of half and half almost it was like half of us went to these

469
00:37:41.14 --> 00:37:46.62
Coast halfes work. Yeah guys go to STVs. Were you married yet? I was I got married right before but

470
00:37:48.14 --> 00:37:52.66
So I I went home after a school on that leave

471
00:37:52.66 --> 00:38:00.26
Got married and then went to Buds and then my wife finished college and then she moved out

472
00:38:00.66 --> 00:38:06.90
to San Diego after she finished. What do you think about coming to San Diego? In the beginning

473
00:38:08.30 --> 00:38:11.38
It was she didn't want to leave leave

474
00:38:11.62 --> 00:38:14.30
You know the East Coast because all of our family was there and

475
00:38:15.70 --> 00:38:18.90
So she's like all right. I'll go to California, but

476
00:38:18.90 --> 00:38:21.90
Don't ever ask me to go out of the country and

477
00:38:23.26 --> 00:38:29.54
Of course 15 years later we get orders to Germany and she would have left without me because she wanted to go so bad

478
00:38:29.94 --> 00:38:31.94
She had a total turn around and

479
00:38:32.94 --> 00:38:36.22
But we we joke about this all the time because we're still married

480
00:38:37.38 --> 00:38:39.38
Yeah 31 years

481
00:38:39.38 --> 00:38:47.46
Impressive, but yeah, yeah, it was she came out San Diego and being married in Buds was kind of interesting because

482
00:38:48.82 --> 00:38:51.22
Yeah a lot of people think and I I did

483
00:38:51.74 --> 00:38:55.34
You know before I found out that you know, but it's kind of like boot camp where you're there

484
00:38:55.34 --> 00:38:58.42
I'm all the time, but it's not you know you you have a schedule

485
00:38:58.42 --> 00:39:02.74
You show up for the schedule when you're done for the day you're done and we can't you're done so we lived out in town

486
00:39:03.46 --> 00:39:05.66
And where'd you guys live down in I be?

487
00:39:05.66 --> 00:39:12.58
And you had a crappy apartment she had a college friend that came out with or so to help with the rent and

488
00:39:14.18 --> 00:39:18.78
But our room was all guys who lived off base

489
00:39:19.22 --> 00:39:27.14
So it's a very clean because we weren't living it the beds were always made floors were always wet by come in and

490
00:39:27.74 --> 00:39:28.94
And actually

491
00:39:28.94 --> 00:39:32.58
Ty Woods was one of my roommates from from Benghazi

492
00:39:32.58 --> 00:39:40.30
Who we later died in Benghazi and but yeah, we cuz he lived off base so all the guys that had

493
00:39:40.66 --> 00:39:43.06
Places off base got a room together and

494
00:39:44.30 --> 00:39:48.90
So we didn't have to clean it so you clean I didn't leave our base

495
00:39:48.90 --> 00:39:54.38
I don't think I left basins like even to this day if I can stay at my house

496
00:39:54.38 --> 00:39:58.50
I I'll say at my house. I don't want to go anywhere. Yeah, there's no one I want to go. There's no one that's like hey

497
00:39:58.50 --> 00:40:01.86
You want to go to restaurant echoes like hey, we're I'm having the fight to my house tonight

498
00:40:01.86 --> 00:40:03.86
I'm like cool

499
00:40:03.86 --> 00:40:06.42
I watch no I'll be watching him too. I'm watching for myself in my house

500
00:40:06.42 --> 00:40:07.54
I

501
00:40:07.54 --> 00:40:13.14
When I was like okay, this is my barracks. I was in 602 whatever that bear the barracks 602. I'm in barracks cool. I stayed there

502
00:40:13.14 --> 00:40:17.70
That's all I did was stay there. I don't think I left I don't think I left base

503
00:40:19.22 --> 00:40:20.58
In first phase I

504
00:40:20.82 --> 00:40:26.22
Don't think I maybe I might get I go to subway or something possibly, but knowledge is in there like sharpened my knife

505
00:40:26.22 --> 00:40:29.30
Didn't have a car didn't have a bike. What are we gonna do?

506
00:40:29.30 --> 00:40:33.62
I'm gonna sharpen my knife gonna polish my boots gonna clean my room gonna hang out with my other loser

507
00:40:33.62 --> 00:40:38.50
Roots that are also young and just not doing anything and we're just gonna sit around and have fun

508
00:40:38.90 --> 00:40:43.62
But yeah that that idea of that people don't understand is that bugs

509
00:40:43.86 --> 00:40:47.78
You want it when training is over you can go you can go get drunk if you want to

510
00:40:49.30 --> 00:40:55.78
It's almost a test and it's own right of what you're gonna do and how you're gonna behave and you'll get rolled up eventually or that'll be that

511
00:40:55.78 --> 00:40:59.46
So you end up getting orders to seal team one

512
00:41:00.98 --> 00:41:03.86
Did you protest them or you just like oh no

513
00:41:04.42 --> 00:41:09.54
That's where they want me to go and and I mean again it was like I was the only guy I was with

514
00:41:10.10 --> 00:41:16.82
15 16 of my best friend so it's like I love we're going here and and then any we all kind of went to team one

515
00:41:16.82 --> 00:41:18.82
Right, would it people go to other teams?

516
00:41:19.38 --> 00:41:23.30
Yeah, so other West Coast teams a couple guys went to five like my

517
00:41:23.30 --> 00:41:25.30
I

518
00:41:25.30 --> 00:41:27.30
You went to five a couple guys went to

519
00:41:27.70 --> 00:41:31.06
STBs. I wasn't I'm not sure what coast they were on but but yeah, we had

520
00:41:32.10 --> 00:41:40.58
But they were kind of anonymally there was a big grouping a crew of us went to one yeah a crew of us went to one that was what happened yeah

521
00:41:42.34 --> 00:41:44.34
When when we showed up

522
00:41:45.86 --> 00:41:48.10
We didn't even you and I went to comm school

523
00:41:48.10 --> 00:41:53.30
Before we even went through SQT right yeah, so when we showed up at that time

524
00:41:54.18 --> 00:41:55.54
the

525
00:41:55.70 --> 00:41:57.70
Training department

526
00:41:57.70 --> 00:41:59.70
Which was at the team they had

527
00:42:00.34 --> 00:42:03.94
Of course, they had to train the platoon that were getting ready to go overseas

528
00:42:04.82 --> 00:42:11.06
So they only did SQT so qualification training at certain times of the year

529
00:42:11.86 --> 00:42:16.34
And you had to wait till you got people because remember we had people from other class

530
00:42:16.34 --> 00:42:21.06
Came after us that that went through that training together

531
00:42:21.86 --> 00:42:23.86
So during that time

532
00:42:24.66 --> 00:42:27.70
We all went to departments to work and

533
00:42:29.22 --> 00:42:34.82
Before I joined the Navy I met a the only time I ever met a prior seal

534
00:42:35.70 --> 00:42:37.70
That gave me any decent information

535
00:42:39.22 --> 00:42:43.94
It was in Kentucky. I don't remember how I got connected to it. I think it was through my parents because he was

536
00:42:43.94 --> 00:42:48.82
Had did something with trucking and he met me for breakfast one morning. So

537
00:42:50.02 --> 00:42:56.10
17 I think at this time and I'm just asking all the any question that I had and he just you know

538
00:42:56.10 --> 00:42:59.06
He was very direct frank with me. He was

539
00:43:00.34 --> 00:43:06.10
You know dispel a lot of the myths like killing the puppy and and yeah literally drowned you yeah

540
00:43:06.10 --> 00:43:08.90
Yeah, yeah, I'll all the all the stupid stuff and

541
00:43:09.86 --> 00:43:11.22
he

542
00:43:11.22 --> 00:43:17.94
gave me like a couple pieces of advice first thing was for for hell week how to get through hell week this was his his

543
00:43:18.74 --> 00:43:20.74
thought was that

544
00:43:21.38 --> 00:43:25.94
What gets guys the most is they plan are they they think too far I hit

545
00:43:26.34 --> 00:43:28.34
They're not focused on the now and

546
00:43:29.46 --> 00:43:37.38
So they'll you're getting ready to do a run or you know get ready to do rock portage and you're thinking of what's what's gonna happen next week

547
00:43:37.94 --> 00:43:40.58
And you know on the swim that I'm not very good at

548
00:43:40.58 --> 00:43:46.50
And they just that gets into this loop and you just end up quitting

549
00:43:46.82 --> 00:43:50.58
He said don't do that just think about what what are you doing right now? You got to run?

550
00:43:50.90 --> 00:43:52.90
What do you have to do to prepare?

551
00:43:52.90 --> 00:43:56.58
Get your boots get your you know gear and and do the run

552
00:43:57.30 --> 00:43:59.30
What's next a swim?

553
00:43:59.30 --> 00:44:03.70
Okay, what I need I need my knife. I need my does so just just stay on the now

554
00:44:04.66 --> 00:44:08.26
And then when that gets too tough then just take it

555
00:44:08.26 --> 00:44:14.42
You know, I'm gonna get to this next hour and I'm just gonna focus on what I'm doing

556
00:44:14.90 --> 00:44:16.90
Get through whatever

557
00:44:16.90 --> 00:44:23.94
It is right now get over this obstacle and then I can move to the next one and and that's what I did that during

558
00:44:23.94 --> 00:44:28.50
Hellweek you know, it's like what am I doing right now and hellweek is great for that because you don't have to plan

559
00:44:29.30 --> 00:44:37.46
Oh, you have to do is show up with right gear and and do what they tell you to do for me hell week was a relief because I wasn't worried about failing anything because I was like hey

560
00:44:37.46 --> 00:44:39.46
I

561
00:44:39.46 --> 00:44:43.86
I wasn't I had failed a swim like I said because my

562
00:44:45.14 --> 00:44:48.50
Because we had issues and I I had failed one run

563
00:44:50.18 --> 00:44:54.58
Because I tried to pace myself and I'm not a fast runner so I was like, oh, you know

564
00:44:54.58 --> 00:44:56.82
I've passed whatever it was three runs at this point

565
00:44:56.82 --> 00:45:02.34
So I'm gonna pace myself on this one and I failed a barely failed but I failed so I was always

566
00:45:02.34 --> 00:45:07.86
Sweating failing stuff and so when hellweek was coming I was like cool

567
00:45:07.86 --> 00:45:11.06
I can't fail anything bring it and I had fun

568
00:45:11.30 --> 00:45:15.78
Yeah, I mean I I had fun because I do that I wasn't gonna quit and I was just

569
00:45:17.06 --> 00:45:23.46
Having a good time so the second piece of advice that gave me came when when when you get to the team

570
00:45:25.06 --> 00:45:27.54
You need to find the job that nobody wants

571
00:45:27.54 --> 00:45:34.26
Do it do it well and you'll always have work so when we showed up at sulti one

572
00:45:35.30 --> 00:45:37.54
And we're all kind of going into the departments

573
00:45:38.10 --> 00:45:45.54
I was like I want to go into the comms department and because nobody else wanted it because carrying the radio was heavy and

574
00:45:47.14 --> 00:45:50.18
People had this kind of idea that comms was

575
00:45:50.90 --> 00:45:54.34
Just a mysterious magic thing when when it worked

576
00:45:54.34 --> 00:45:59.14
It was pfm you know pure fucking magic when it didn't well, you know

577
00:45:59.62 --> 00:46:03.30
God's weren't aligned, you know that yeah the moon wasn't aligned that day and

578
00:46:04.26 --> 00:46:11.46
And I knew that not to be true and if I could you know do that job well then I knew I would always

579
00:46:12.02 --> 00:46:14.02
Have a job and and back then

580
00:46:14.42 --> 00:46:20.18
You know if you weren't in a platoon they had you in a department and you know like well today

581
00:46:20.18 --> 00:46:26.66
It's you know everybody's a shooter or so you just keep rotating out but back then there was no guarantee of that and if they had

582
00:46:26.98 --> 00:46:28.98
Too many people at the team

583
00:46:29.22 --> 00:46:33.86
Then if they didn't need you then you did you'd just sat in a department until something else came

584
00:46:34.74 --> 00:46:38.74
so I wanted to to go into comms and

585
00:46:41.06 --> 00:46:43.06
When we got to the team

586
00:46:44.18 --> 00:46:46.18
There was a billet

587
00:46:46.18 --> 00:46:53.38
Two billets that opened up at the East Coast and comm school and the way I remember it at that time

588
00:46:54.02 --> 00:46:57.94
You know there was this kind of my belief was there was this real

589
00:46:59.70 --> 00:47:02.34
East Coast West Coast rivalry and

590
00:47:02.74 --> 00:47:09.38
None of the older guys at the team wanted to go to the school because that's East Coast. I don't want to go to these ghosts. We do it better here and

591
00:47:09.38 --> 00:47:19.78
And the I think people in the training were like, you know, you can't teach me anything and we were new guys hadn't even didn't even have our

592
00:47:19.78 --> 00:47:24.34
Try and you know or even through SKT so we're like we'll go and

593
00:47:26.66 --> 00:47:35.30
And sure enough they're like okay cool and yeah, they sent us to a to comm school. I had stood quarter deck watch with a

594
00:47:35.30 --> 00:47:39.94
Post-platoon commander lieutenant who

595
00:47:40.58 --> 00:47:44.82
We you know, so we this is back when you just sleep on the quarter deck, you know, that will bunk broom

596
00:47:44.98 --> 00:47:52.42
So we were hanging out you know whatever we got pizza for dinner and I mean this is literally within being of at the team for probably a week

597
00:47:53.30 --> 00:48:00.50
And he says you know, I'm like, you know, freaking I'm late rockin' off. I think we're going to nom the whole nine yards

598
00:48:00.50 --> 00:48:07.06
And you know, he he says what you know, what do you what do you're hoping that he's a very cerebral guy?

599
00:48:07.06 --> 00:48:12.90
Anyways, very nice guy. Is that what you know? What are you looking to do? Look a look at I want to go on ops. I want to be I want to go out there

600
00:48:12.90 --> 00:48:15.38
And he goes to be hey if you really want to go on operations

601
00:48:16.58 --> 00:48:22.82
You need to become a comm sky because no one wants to do it and yet every operation

602
00:48:23.30 --> 00:48:28.82
You want their 100% has to be a comms guy there. You don't necessarily need a sniper

603
00:48:28.82 --> 00:48:30.82
You don't necessarily need a point man

604
00:48:31.14 --> 00:48:37.06
You don't necessarily need a machine gunner a rigor you don't necessarily need a rigor you need a coms guy

605
00:48:37.06 --> 00:48:40.98
And so if you want to go on every operation you go be a comms guy that morning

606
00:48:40.98 --> 00:48:44.90
I woke up really turned over the watch when right to the comms department said I'm where you call how do you read human?

607
00:48:45.22 --> 00:48:52.02
So so there you go. That's how I ended up and I remember there was push back from the guy at the east coast

608
00:48:52.02 --> 00:48:55.06
It said we do in sent me to do guys this is an advanced course of instruction

609
00:48:55.38 --> 00:48:57.94
You can't send new guys. They're gonna get slaughtered out here

610
00:48:57.94 --> 00:49:00.34
Yeah, and we just said bring it

611
00:49:02.02 --> 00:49:09.54
So so we shot that was a freaking great course of instruction. It was phenomenal and you know that was again the start of our career

612
00:49:10.74 --> 00:49:12.74
And to have that

613
00:49:12.74 --> 00:49:19.30
That skill and and again when when we get back are got back from from the course

614
00:49:19.30 --> 00:49:28.50
I'm sure that we had some bit of arrogance about us. I know that might surprise you

615
00:49:28.50 --> 00:49:29.70
I'm not sure

616
00:49:29.70 --> 00:49:33.70
But I mean we we

617
00:49:33.70 --> 00:49:36.50
We understood it we we had

618
00:49:37.22 --> 00:49:46.74
The skill down and there was nobody could touch us and you probably remember the guy who taught comms and training self at the time

619
00:49:46.74 --> 00:49:48.74
He was not a family

620
00:49:50.26 --> 00:49:55.70
Me you hated you hated me you were quiet enough to be like going to the radar

621
00:49:55.70 --> 00:49:57.70
I was like that's actually wrong

622
00:49:59.06 --> 00:50:01.30
19 year old jockel is a handful

623
00:50:02.50 --> 00:50:05.30
When you're as cute and he was doing his conglies

624
00:50:06.10 --> 00:50:09.38
He was just all over the place and

625
00:50:10.26 --> 00:50:13.62
I remember specifically the Zulu time to remember that

626
00:50:13.62 --> 00:50:21.70
What he was trying to explain in developing a comms plan that all times are in Zulu and why it's in Zulu

627
00:50:22.74 --> 00:50:25.78
But his terminology wasn't quite correct and

628
00:50:26.42 --> 00:50:30.90
He was saying that Zulu time is so many hours

629
00:50:32.18 --> 00:50:35.94
Back or something and you were like no Zulu time is

630
00:50:38.82 --> 00:50:42.66
And you could see a new guy bro and you can see it in his face

631
00:50:42.66 --> 00:50:48.90
He's getting kind of ready. He's like no no no what what it means because it was something I had to do with daylight savings

632
00:50:48.90 --> 00:50:54.10
I mean change and it's it's like it's this off of Zulu and you're like no

633
00:50:54.74 --> 00:50:56.74
Zulu time the Zulu time

634
00:50:57.30 --> 00:50:59.30
He's around my life on Zulu time

635
00:51:00.34 --> 00:51:05.14
So when we went to that course this is the cool thing so we showed up at this course. We're not seals. We're I mean we're new guys

636
00:51:05.78 --> 00:51:10.26
We don't have our tridents yet. We jump in with a bunch of experienced East Coast guys and

637
00:51:10.26 --> 00:51:15.30
And actually it was another there was a couple guys from team five out there that we had a poll tune or some

638
00:51:15.86 --> 00:51:18.02
Poll tune or two under the belts and we just

639
00:51:18.66 --> 00:51:22.42
Same thing where everyone's lit there they're living in town whatever we're living in the barracks

640
00:51:22.74 --> 00:51:27.94
We're all we're doing a setting we have to learn more as code you and I are like talking to each other in more as code like we could see

641
00:51:28.50 --> 00:51:31.54
Theo and our TDD to right

642
00:51:32.58 --> 00:51:38.66
Studying this stuff we're totally into it. We have no like people think you got graduate from seal training

643
00:51:38.66 --> 00:51:44.10
You have some kind of tactics for the field. We didn't have any of that we didn't know what we were doing or equipment or or equipment

644
00:51:44.10 --> 00:51:45.62
Yeah, that's what we didn't have anything

645
00:51:45.94 --> 00:51:51.30
So the chief at first he was pissed that we got sent out there you sent me these two knucklehead new guys

646
00:51:51.38 --> 00:51:56.42
But then he realized we were freaking fired up and we want to be like there's not too many seals that are like

647
00:51:56.42 --> 00:52:01.46
I want to be a radio man. That's what we literally wanted to do so once he realized that

648
00:52:01.46 --> 00:52:07.78
He was kind of like okay, but then he would kind of test us and one of the tests. He did so that that course

649
00:52:08.98 --> 00:52:10.98
The end of the course was a

650
00:52:11.94 --> 00:52:13.94
six or seven day

651
00:52:14.98 --> 00:52:22.18
In the field FTX and it was around a swamp is around an airfield. That's a swamp. You're in the middle of a swamp

652
00:52:23.06 --> 00:52:25.54
So this chief that was running the course

653
00:52:26.34 --> 00:52:29.06
He he he goes well in

654
00:52:29.06 --> 00:52:36.10
And he says hey if you're hardcore you'll go in the field with nothing but a poncho and a poncho liner

655
00:52:37.38 --> 00:52:39.78
And I was like what did you say if I'm hardcore?

656
00:52:39.78 --> 00:52:40.82
Is that what you said?

657
00:52:40.82 --> 00:52:45.62
Because trust me. I'm juggle out for you hardcore. So you're a poncho and a poncho liner

658
00:52:45.86 --> 00:52:49.62
That's what okay cool. Yes. I'm hardcore. I'm going to field with a poncho and a poncho liner. What?

659
00:52:49.86 --> 00:52:52.98
By the way, key component here poncho poncho liner

660
00:52:53.70 --> 00:52:55.22
No ground pad

661
00:52:55.22 --> 00:53:00.98
Which is which is insane. Yeah, did you have a ground pad? No, so so you and I are idiots

662
00:53:01.38 --> 00:53:07.86
We have no ground pad. We have no sleeping bag. We have no bivisac. We go with a poncho and a poncho liner

663
00:53:08.26 --> 00:53:12.34
And we are wearing wool not the smart wool you get today, but like

664
00:53:13.54 --> 00:53:16.74
World war two. Yeah, WWE. I I

665
00:53:16.74 --> 00:53:18.74
I think we even went to

666
00:53:19.86 --> 00:53:21.38
one of those

667
00:53:21.38 --> 00:53:23.38
GI Joe stores or whatever and was buying

668
00:53:23.38 --> 00:53:27.38
Old wool he up to where so

669
00:53:28.26 --> 00:53:29.46
We go in the field

670
00:53:30.10 --> 00:53:36.34
When we start get when we draw it when we're driving to the field and now so it's January in Virginia

671
00:53:37.22 --> 00:53:43.22
February maybe yeah, January January February we're driving to the field on our drive

672
00:53:43.86 --> 00:53:45.86
It starts raining

673
00:53:46.18 --> 00:53:50.02
As we start pulling into the area of operations it turns to sleep

674
00:53:50.02 --> 00:53:56.18
As we're getting out of the vehicles it turns to snow. Yeah, it's for easy

675
00:53:57.22 --> 00:54:02.82
And I remember as we got out of the vehicle and we start you know our patrol into our first point

676
00:54:03.38 --> 00:54:06.02
We get to this little creek or

677
00:54:07.22 --> 00:54:09.22
Actually has water in it and

678
00:54:10.10 --> 00:54:14.58
Jocco and I look at each other and track on this and he goes you know it only sucks the first time

679
00:54:14.58 --> 00:54:21.46
Because yeah, you get wet once you're wet. You're not going to get wet once and so we just

680
00:54:21.94 --> 00:54:27.06
Joe right through it. Yep, it only sucked the first time that first time lasted seven days

681
00:54:27.06 --> 00:54:28.66
It sucked once for seven straight days

682
00:54:30.10 --> 00:54:35.70
So we end up so on that course you had we had communications windows that we had to make with

683
00:54:36.34 --> 00:54:38.34
Stations around the country

684
00:54:38.74 --> 00:54:42.18
So we're setting up these old school antennas echo trials

685
00:54:42.18 --> 00:54:46.82
This is where you literally take out pieces of wire and you measure the wire

686
00:54:47.30 --> 00:54:51.86
To the frequency that you're going to be communicating on and you hang these pieces of wire planned

687
00:54:51.86 --> 00:54:53.86
Destantly in trees

688
00:54:54.90 --> 00:55:00.98
And then you make these communications window and we have like a communications window every two to four hours the entire time

689
00:55:02.10 --> 00:55:07.22
And what happens is if you you're getting graded the whole time and he comes out and checks your

690
00:55:07.46 --> 00:55:11.46
You know if you've got like what they call if you're out camping so if you've got stuff strewn about

691
00:55:11.46 --> 00:55:14.50
And you got your sleeping bag out and everything's out of your rucksack

692
00:55:15.62 --> 00:55:21.14
Then he's going to dock you pointer. He's going to send you on E and E or something like this and if you miss

693
00:55:21.46 --> 00:55:27.38
Communications windows then that's points against you and how strong your comms is that can be points against your points for you

694
00:55:27.94 --> 00:55:31.54
So what happens with all the other groups literally every single other group?

695
00:55:32.42 --> 00:55:37.54
They missed some of their com windows because it's every two to four hours and why did they miss their com windows?

696
00:55:37.54 --> 00:55:43.70
Because they would fall asleep why would they fall asleep they fell asleep because they got it on a ground pad got into a babysack in a freaking negative

697
00:55:44.26 --> 00:55:45.62
Zero degree

698
00:55:45.62 --> 00:55:48.50
Sleeping bag and they just would fall asleep

699
00:55:48.90 --> 00:55:51.22
We literally could not sleep

700
00:55:51.30 --> 00:55:56.34
We could not sleep we were we were just stand we were I remember just just sit there looking at you

701
00:55:56.34 --> 00:55:58.34
We're marching in place

702
00:55:58.90 --> 00:56:00.90
By a tree

703
00:56:00.90 --> 00:56:03.14
That's two o'clock in the morning three o'clock in the morning

704
00:56:03.14 --> 00:56:10.26
We have every piece of clothing that we have on we got a poncho over us and we're marching in place trying to stay warm because we're gonna freeze to death

705
00:56:10.26 --> 00:56:15.54
We're so key wet it was freaking ridiculous no ground pad

706
00:56:16.82 --> 00:56:18.82
We don't miss any com windows

707
00:56:18.98 --> 00:56:23.38
We we set up the great antennas because we had all this time to set them up because we weren't sleeping

708
00:56:24.82 --> 00:56:31.78
And we make all of our com windows we make good communications on all those com windows and we end up as the number one

709
00:56:31.78 --> 00:56:36.50
Parent and the number one pair gets the early extract meaning when everyone had to stay in like

710
00:56:37.46 --> 00:56:39.62
The full day or the extra night or whatever

711
00:56:39.78 --> 00:56:45.22
We get pulled out of the field early as the number one pair two freaking meatball new guys

712
00:56:46.10 --> 00:56:48.10
We get pulled out of the field early and

713
00:56:48.34 --> 00:56:52.90
Here's a here's an awesome thing and I don't know if I don't know if you know this but that chief

714
00:56:53.70 --> 00:56:59.86
Called yeah the mastery if yeah, he called the master chief of our command and said hey you sent these two knuckleheads out there

715
00:56:59.86 --> 00:57:03.38
They just graduated the number one pair in the class they're freaking squared away

716
00:57:03.54 --> 00:57:07.86
You should you should take care of these two guys. They're great seals which was we weren't even seals

717
00:57:08.50 --> 00:57:11.94
So it was really cool obviously I let it go to my head like hey

718
00:57:11.94 --> 00:57:15.86
No one can tell me anything about coms the free you don't think cops guys

719
00:57:16.58 --> 00:57:21.22
Well, I mean if you look at it, it wasn't like we were just a right place at the right time

720
00:57:21.22 --> 00:57:26.02
And you know we made a good decision that was it. I mean we knew we knew our shit

721
00:57:26.02 --> 00:57:28.02
Yeah, and there was no one else

722
00:57:28.02 --> 00:57:35.38
At that team at least that could counter that so yeah, I think we were you know somewhat arrogant

723
00:57:35.38 --> 00:57:41.54
But again that's what we said out to do we we wanted the hardest job. We were gonna do it well and

724
00:57:42.82 --> 00:57:47.86
We never had a problem finding work. Yeah, that was that was good times

725
00:57:49.54 --> 00:57:51.06
So

726
00:57:51.06 --> 00:57:55.54
Then we go and ask you tea. Yeah, so we go to ask you tea when we get back

727
00:57:55.54 --> 00:58:00.82
Which we had just been through freaking hell week. I think it might have been harder than hell week

728
00:58:01.06 --> 00:58:05.94
Well, I came out worse. Oh, that's right that you had significant trench for yeah, yeah, yeah

729
00:58:06.18 --> 00:58:11.94
To where I have for weeks I was down and I remember like sitting at home. I have a my feet and

730
00:58:12.74 --> 00:58:18.90
Hot our warm ups and salt and just the pain of that feeling when it when it

731
00:58:18.90 --> 00:58:26.50
You know comes back to your nerves and and still today. I have nerve damage from that. It's when I retired

732
00:58:26.50 --> 00:58:30.66
And you go through your your medical screening and yeah, I still have

733
00:58:32.10 --> 00:58:36.26
Part of from that now I've gotten used to it. It's been been been so long

734
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:44.98
But yeah, you had a legitimate case in 1991 or 1992 of World War I trench foot yeah from spending a

735
00:58:44.98 --> 00:58:50.26
Whatever seven days in the freezing cold with our feet will wet the entire time that's another thing

736
00:58:50.26 --> 00:58:51.94
We he told us to wear jungle boots

737
00:58:52.26 --> 00:58:56.26
He's like you you wear it because you wear all these these standards you know

738
00:58:56.26 --> 00:58:59.70
Danners and these high-speed boots you thought they're gonna get wet and you're you know

739
00:58:59.70 --> 00:59:04.50
You're they're never gonna dry out and I was like Roger that so what I wear jungle boots. What do you wear jungle?

740
00:59:04.50 --> 00:59:05.70
It was I

741
00:59:05.70 --> 00:59:09.14
I actually carried that through my entire career my entire career

742
00:59:09.14 --> 00:59:15.78
Almost worked jungle boots 90% of the time unless my rule was if there's snow on the ground in insert

743
00:59:16.18 --> 00:59:19.94
During insert I'll wear something else if there's not snow on the ground

744
00:59:20.18 --> 00:59:24.42
I'm wearing jungle boots and I did that my whole career because your feet because jungle boots

745
00:59:24.66 --> 00:59:27.70
They dry out echoed Charles so there's little there's little drainage holes

746
00:59:28.66 --> 00:59:33.62
So they dry out it might take him a few hours, but if you're wearing a pair of thick insulated boots

747
00:59:34.10 --> 00:59:38.34
They are not gonna dry out and so I wore jungle boots almost my whole career

748
00:59:38.34 --> 00:59:41.22
And finally they started making some modern boots that will now were

749
00:59:42.42 --> 00:59:46.02
Comparable to the boots so now we go to SQT

750
00:59:47.38 --> 00:59:55.54
Which was awesome we had great instructors in there great instructors teach us the fundamentals we were kind we we got

751
00:59:57.30 --> 01:00:02.74
It was almost like our generation of instructors those guys were like a one degree of separation from Vietnam

752
01:00:02.74 --> 01:00:07.38
For the vast majority of our instructor it was I also think it was important that

753
01:00:08.66 --> 01:00:11.62
The training was still at the team at the time so

754
01:00:12.10 --> 01:00:18.02
You know these were people that you were gonna be an uplaton with and you know there was a lot

755
01:00:18.34 --> 01:00:22.66
Especially a salty one. We have the kind of that history of having that ownership and

756
01:00:24.82 --> 01:00:31.70
Meeting a certain standard and they they really they really pushed that and I think that came out and the training that we got

757
01:00:31.70 --> 01:00:39.06
During that time, but yeah, these were guys that had been in for and had multiple multiple tunes

758
01:00:39.06 --> 01:00:43.22
I mean, they just did it over and over and yeah, they had quality quality training

759
01:00:43.78 --> 01:00:45.22
It seems

760
01:00:45.54 --> 01:00:47.70
Kind of funny now when I look back on it

761
01:00:47.70 --> 01:00:52.74
But there was this thing that they would say a team one team one. It's not just a number. It's an attitude and

762
01:00:53.78 --> 01:00:59.30
They in fact our seniors oftentimes were kind of joking when they said that because you know

763
01:00:59.30 --> 01:01:05.70
We also had the nickname was stollog tin one because we had uniform inspections and haircut inspections and everything was

764
01:01:06.18 --> 01:01:08.18
Like more militant

765
01:01:08.42 --> 01:01:10.42
But I believed it

766
01:01:10.42 --> 01:01:14.22
I mean I was like yeah, hey, it's not just a number. It's an attitude. Especially young

767
01:01:14.34 --> 01:01:19.94
Dr. Here's all about that like what number one that means something there's a reason team one

768
01:01:20.50 --> 01:01:22.50
Of course, so I got a little crazy with that

769
01:01:24.10 --> 01:01:26.58
But the instructors freaking outstanding

770
01:01:26.58 --> 01:01:28.58
Um

771
01:01:28.58 --> 01:01:35.94
And I still I so much of what I learned I learned it then and I fast forward a little bit

772
01:01:35.94 --> 01:01:39.06
But I always say like 70% of what I learned in the teams

773
01:01:39.06 --> 01:01:44.50
I learned while we were instructors at training so I'd say a team one absolutely we'll get to that

774
01:01:46.66 --> 01:01:48.66
So

775
01:01:49.14 --> 01:01:53.14
We go through that we go through SQT. We had anything any big high points of SQT

776
01:01:53.14 --> 01:01:56.90
No, it was just again, we were with all the guys from

777
01:01:56.90 --> 01:02:00.98
But it's a big amount of the road class and just quality quality people and

778
01:02:01.62 --> 01:02:05.94
Now it was it was a good time the training was good and you know back to the stollog one

779
01:02:07.70 --> 01:02:13.86
I mean and I consider I'm sure you do too. I mean we grew up at sulti one and just what we learned there

780
01:02:14.74 --> 01:02:16.74
Set for the rest of the career

781
01:02:16.74 --> 01:02:22.50
Set your your work ethic your you know the way you see things and the the the community as a whole

782
01:02:22.50 --> 01:02:25.22
And I'm proud to have been

783
01:02:26.50 --> 01:02:31.06
At team one and from that period of time. This is the abs phenomenal. Yeah

784
01:02:32.66 --> 01:02:34.66
I think I remember this time

785
01:02:34.90 --> 01:02:38.10
Where you you told me you were going on a trip

786
01:02:40.02 --> 01:02:44.74
And I think you were going on some kind of a trip and team five was also going on a trip

787
01:02:44.74 --> 01:02:47.30
And remember you tell me you should have seen their palettes

788
01:02:48.10 --> 01:02:51.94
Like meaning their aircraft out when you build when you're going on a big trip you you load your

789
01:02:51.94 --> 01:02:57.46
Your your aircraft palettes with all your gear and there's a science to it and there's an art to it too

790
01:02:57.46 --> 01:03:02.10
Like making all square and way making a way to write making a look good and making a look clean so the air force and

791
01:03:02.10 --> 01:03:07.22
Spectra will pass you and everything and you should have seen the team five palettes you were disgusted

792
01:03:09.38 --> 01:03:11.38
I mean if it looks like trash probably flies

793
01:03:11.38 --> 01:03:15.38
Right

794
01:03:17.54 --> 01:03:24.18
We get down with SQT and we roll into our first platoon's we're in sister platoon's now we had to be

795
01:03:24.42 --> 01:03:26.74
Yep because they didn't want to stack the platoon's with

796
01:03:27.46 --> 01:03:32.82
With with both of us so they and this was a they could great you know strategic decision

797
01:03:33.22 --> 01:03:38.50
They always had us you and I in different platoon's but I mean we talked every day and I remember

798
01:03:38.50 --> 01:03:44.82
You know if I did a a complain or something that worked or didn't work or we would get together and debrief about it

799
01:03:44.82 --> 01:03:48.98
And but yeah, they always kind of kept us kept us separated

800
01:03:49.70 --> 01:03:54.42
We the primary calm guy in your first platoon no I there was a primary but

801
01:03:56.02 --> 01:04:01.70
You know it was early on like just just get it done so I had a lot of leeway

802
01:04:02.66 --> 01:04:06.02
But because you know he was I had other stuff to do but

803
01:04:06.02 --> 01:04:09.46
But it was pretty pretty clear who was making

804
01:04:10.58 --> 01:04:13.54
The the compliance and who was keeping the gear and

805
01:04:14.34 --> 01:04:20.26
But and then from then on yeah, yeah, I was super lucky being they I was the primary calm guy in my first platoon

806
01:04:20.74 --> 01:04:24.74
Pretty awesome a lot of responsibility for a freaking meatball new guy and

807
01:04:25.38 --> 01:04:31.06
That's also where I realized hey if you don't want to be told what to do do it ahead of anyone being able to tell you what to do

808
01:04:31.06 --> 01:04:37.22
So that was my goal our platoon's had some unique personalities very very unique

809
01:04:38.74 --> 01:04:45.38
Your platoon was pretty savage dude. They it was again an interesting time and it wasn't

810
01:04:47.38 --> 01:04:49.38
It wasn't like an even

811
01:04:49.78 --> 01:04:57.70
or like a bell curve it was you either a brand new guy or you had four five platoon and there was

812
01:04:57.70 --> 01:05:02.02
I maybe one but there was there was really no in between and

813
01:05:04.66 --> 01:05:06.34
Luckily

814
01:05:06.34 --> 01:05:08.34
I think there was five or six of us

815
01:05:09.38 --> 01:05:14.66
New guys new guys that there was at least one or two that had the spotlight

816
01:05:15.78 --> 01:05:17.78
So I get the spotlight off the

817
01:05:18.42 --> 01:05:21.14
off the others yeah, and I was in my low

818
01:05:21.70 --> 01:05:27.14
You know low mode they were like hey, I'll keep about I'm gonna do what I'm just gonna make cause it was a scary place

819
01:05:27.14 --> 01:05:33.46
In the 90s at team one as a new guy it was there was much different there was there was

820
01:05:35.30 --> 01:05:39.78
There was scenarios I could unfold really quickly if you were out of line as a new guy and

821
01:05:40.18 --> 01:05:45.54
Your platoon had definitely had some bruzers in it. Yeah, yeah, that some bruzers at it

822
01:05:45.94 --> 01:05:51.06
Stods for freaking ledge legendary freaking 90s team guys just getting after it

823
01:05:51.86 --> 01:05:53.86
my platoon was a little bit more

824
01:05:53.86 --> 01:05:55.86
a

825
01:05:56.74 --> 01:06:05.62
Little bit more mellow than that so I mean I've great guys, but just a little bit of a different personality the personality my first platoon was a little bit different the person out of your first platoon

826
01:06:07.30 --> 01:06:10.26
We end up going on deployment together we go to go on

827
01:06:12.02 --> 01:06:20.66
My platoon got in so much trouble on our first trip that we didn't do we never left go on again after my first trip really yep

828
01:06:20.66 --> 01:06:25.06
We did one trip we got to go on we did one trip and we got so much trouble

829
01:06:25.78 --> 01:06:29.30
That we never did a trip again. They pulled us off the schedule Wow

830
01:06:29.30 --> 01:06:34.02
Were you're not going there you're not going there you're not going there. I didn't remember that yeah, so that's why we that's why

831
01:06:35.22 --> 01:06:40.82
Sitting in gloom for five months and how many trips did you go on? I think we did three

832
01:06:41.38 --> 01:06:46.10
So you probably did at least one or two of ours that we were supposed to do we got rotated out

833
01:06:46.50 --> 01:06:48.50
We were disaster

834
01:06:48.50 --> 01:06:51.46
The guys like to party. I mean I must say so

835
01:06:53.22 --> 01:06:57.30
God done with that. I mean what was your first platoon any any big leaders at lessons learned?

836
01:06:58.58 --> 01:07:03.46
No, I get it at the time you just I just did what I was told and you were even no

837
01:07:04.82 --> 01:07:12.26
T at technically with as being a calm guy. Yeah, I was well aware what I needed to do but you know

838
01:07:12.26 --> 01:07:18.58
You're still kind of learning how the community works and now there's things in the in the field that that you know

839
01:07:18.58 --> 01:07:24.18
You're still trying to develop and and you know you mentioned the guys they they were it was a unique

840
01:07:24.98 --> 01:07:29.62
Dynamic but they they were still solid people and

841
01:07:30.18 --> 01:07:34.98
They were good mentors and you know they worked with you if you you know if you were really hey

842
01:07:36.18 --> 01:07:38.82
I'm here to do this then they were all about

843
01:07:38.82 --> 01:07:41.22
Teaching you and sometimes you know

844
01:07:42.26 --> 01:07:46.42
Not the care but the the the stick but but you know

845
01:07:46.42 --> 01:07:48.58
They they did get you to where

846
01:07:49.30 --> 01:07:55.70
By the next platoon you're ready to to be a department head you're ready to lead and and you

847
01:07:55.70 --> 01:07:57.70
Newtatically what you need the

848
01:07:59.38 --> 01:08:00.10
the

849
01:08:00.10 --> 01:08:04.50
Underlined tone that I took away that I think was instilled in me the most at

850
01:08:04.50 --> 01:08:08.98
Silting one was being professional and that applied to like hey

851
01:08:09.46 --> 01:08:13.78
When you're in the field you're a professional and that's what you need to do you you you're squared away

852
01:08:14.10 --> 01:08:17.14
You don't have your crap line all of the place you're gear squared away

853
01:08:17.46 --> 01:08:21.86
You don't have straps hanging off of everything that that was the deal

854
01:08:22.90 --> 01:08:28.10
The time to shoot you freaking you shoot you shoot the way you're supposed to shoot you're not throwing rounds all over the place

855
01:08:28.66 --> 01:08:31.14
When it's time to make homes you make freaking comms and

856
01:08:31.14 --> 01:08:35.78
I still have an e-val that said made comms one hundred percent of the time

857
01:08:36.34 --> 01:08:41.94
What a hundred percent of that there's no math there's no voodoo for freaking me and gift we were making freaking comms

858
01:08:42.18 --> 01:08:45.22
That's it we were making freaking comms that's what was happening

859
01:08:47.86 --> 01:08:52.74
Yeah, but that that high level professionalism yeah, and when I was talking about your platoon had personalities

860
01:08:53.62 --> 01:08:55.62
They definitely had awesome crazy

861
01:08:55.62 --> 01:09:00.58
First analogies, but for sure professional. It was the same thing with the guys that were in in my first platoon

862
01:09:00.90 --> 01:09:03.38
They were a little bit more light-hearted

863
01:09:03.62 --> 01:09:08.66
But they were professionals and you didn't want to mess up you wanted to do good job

864
01:09:08.66 --> 01:09:10.66
You wanted to learn as much as you could

865
01:09:10.98 --> 01:09:16.98
You wanted to be a good you want to be known as a as a good operator. That's what you wanted to be known as and so

866
01:09:17.86 --> 01:09:22.50
That's what you did you know we'd always be all of us all whole new guy crew

867
01:09:23.22 --> 01:09:24.42
Saturday morning be at the team

868
01:09:24.42 --> 01:09:29.38
We'd be working out we'd be fixing gear we'd be hanging out that I remember that until

869
01:09:30.50 --> 01:09:35.06
Until basically we went on that first deployment that was what it was I just remember always being at the team

870
01:09:35.46 --> 01:09:38.34
Always being always this this this the way it was

871
01:09:39.78 --> 01:09:41.78
After that first platoon

872
01:09:42.58 --> 01:09:43.94
then I

873
01:09:43.94 --> 01:09:48.02
Started volunteering for our platoons on the ships and you continued doing the

874
01:09:48.74 --> 01:09:52.02
What we called spec ops platoon site which was going to

875
01:09:52.02 --> 01:09:56.18
Go on basically and then going on exercise from there how was that next platoon?

876
01:09:57.06 --> 01:10:03.14
It was it was good you know because again now you're past the new guy stage and now people are looking to you

877
01:10:04.34 --> 01:10:06.34
You know to to start being a leader and

878
01:10:06.90 --> 01:10:13.78
We had we had good new guy a great new guys and I had now I'm the department head so

879
01:10:14.42 --> 01:10:18.02
If there was any strains on me before now those are all gone

880
01:10:18.02 --> 01:10:23.30
You know we had we had good officers and it was good, but it was still back to Guam and

881
01:10:24.34 --> 01:10:26.34
spec ops

882
01:10:26.34 --> 01:10:27.30
You know

883
01:10:27.30 --> 01:10:34.58
It was the 90s so you know you did you did what they has you to do a lot of fit but the dry one in terms of sense

884
01:10:34.58 --> 01:10:40.18
Yeah, the dry years then then you didn't know the platoon you got back from that yep did a third one and

885
01:10:41.06 --> 01:10:43.06
again now I

886
01:10:43.70 --> 01:10:45.70
Starting to look at okay

887
01:10:45.70 --> 01:10:47.70
I'm ready to be LPO

888
01:10:48.18 --> 01:10:53.78
Chief my I've got the comms thing down. I'm good with that now I need to start moving up and

889
01:10:54.26 --> 01:10:56.66
the problem that we had at that time

890
01:10:57.70 --> 01:10:59.70
was the

891
01:11:00.02 --> 01:11:03.22
The way the Navy worked is you had that source rating

892
01:11:03.94 --> 01:11:09.86
So you competed against that source rating to promote and my source rating was icy and in

893
01:11:09.86 --> 01:11:15.70
Terrier communications electrician so my job in the Navy was supposed to be fixing phones and

894
01:11:17.70 --> 01:11:21.38
Navigation equipment on ships which I had no clue

895
01:11:21.94 --> 01:11:23.94
How to do but

896
01:11:23.94 --> 01:11:28.98
Because I was an electrician and I was I understood how I could look at a schematic

897
01:11:29.46 --> 01:11:34.26
When I took the task because that's what you take the test on I could look at the schematic and go oh, yeah

898
01:11:34.26 --> 01:11:36.10
Oh, this is you know this is a resistor

899
01:11:36.10 --> 01:11:43.54
It's probably this and you know Navy tests are all the same there's two answers that are totally out and then there's two that are pretty close

900
01:11:43.54 --> 01:11:45.38
And you just got to choose the right one

901
01:11:45.38 --> 01:11:49.70
So I was good at taking the test and promoting all the way up to E6

902
01:11:50.10 --> 01:11:55.94
But after that now you're competing you're still competing to to make chief

903
01:11:56.34 --> 01:11:59.30
But we're all competing against in different ratings and

904
01:11:59.30 --> 01:12:06.42
And I seeman just was not advancing because at the time a lot of people that were doing that job

905
01:12:07.46 --> 01:12:08.98
were

906
01:12:08.98 --> 01:12:13.70
Would get out and go work for like AT&T or something and but now

907
01:12:14.90 --> 01:12:20.66
Cellular networks were coming in so nobody was getting out so the only people that were advancing were people would been in

908
01:12:20.98 --> 01:12:23.30
17 18 years because you had to build up that

909
01:12:23.30 --> 01:12:29.46
But then all but all my friends who are in different ratings like the call of technician was one

910
01:12:30.02 --> 01:12:35.70
You know they were making right because everyone was getting out working at the at the ship yards

911
01:12:36.10 --> 01:12:42.74
But we're all doing the same job as a seal, but that's not what they're testing thankfully that that changed and we have an SO rating and

912
01:12:43.86 --> 01:12:47.70
That's better but at the time and that that was really weighing on me on

913
01:12:49.14 --> 01:12:52.10
Promotion because I was ready to advance

914
01:12:52.10 --> 01:12:56.42
But it was a Navy system that was keeping me from from doing that and

915
01:12:57.46 --> 01:12:59.46
So after the third platoon

916
01:13:00.66 --> 01:13:02.66
And that was our first rotation date and

917
01:13:04.10 --> 01:13:06.82
We knew that some people had to leave and

918
01:13:07.86 --> 01:13:12.26
And some some people would stay and I think the the course was was gonna stay

919
01:13:12.74 --> 01:13:19.70
But I needed to find another way to kind of break out and and at the time because we were deploying down to

920
01:13:19.70 --> 01:13:21.70
South East Asia

921
01:13:21.70 --> 01:13:25.54
I looked at okay, how can I be more of a

922
01:13:26.90 --> 01:13:31.46
Of an asset to the team and in my third platoon who we had a

923
01:13:32.82 --> 01:13:38.98
Our our platoon chief who made master chief and who I'm talking about because I think you did it with him too

924
01:13:39.38 --> 01:13:41.38
Awesome guy, but he was a tie speaker

925
01:13:41.38 --> 01:13:46.02
And we did a trip to to Thailand and and I just remember

926
01:13:46.02 --> 01:13:48.82
He kind of commanded

927
01:13:49.54 --> 01:13:53.78
Everything even though he wasn't the guy in charge, but he spoke the language and

928
01:13:54.50 --> 01:13:57.22
you know kind of going back to

929
01:13:57.94 --> 01:14:00.74
You know you want you want to be an asset and

930
01:14:01.38 --> 01:14:09.46
To be a calm guy you're always gonna go because you have the radio what if you're a linguist that that too and this was the 90s so at the time

931
01:14:11.06 --> 01:14:14.18
The administrators I think it was built-in administration

932
01:14:14.18 --> 01:14:18.18
They were starting to normalize relations with Vietnam and

933
01:14:19.86 --> 01:14:25.14
We didn't have any Vietnamese speakers at the team. I think we had one he was actually from Vietnam

934
01:14:25.86 --> 01:14:32.02
But we had a ton of tie speakers and a ton of others so I was like okay here's an opportunity to

935
01:14:32.98 --> 01:14:34.98
You know kind of get a skill

936
01:14:34.98 --> 01:14:40.58
I get I have you know there want people to rotate so I want to go to language school for a year and

937
01:14:40.58 --> 01:14:45.62
And I want to stay on the West Coast so I want to take a an Asian language

938
01:14:45.62 --> 01:14:49.14
I end up taking me at the knees but that was an opportunity to

939
01:14:49.78 --> 01:14:53.70
To be able to come back and and I eventually came back to one

940
01:14:53.86 --> 01:14:57.86
But so that was a one year school one year. Yeah, it was

941
01:14:58.42 --> 01:15:01.86
one of the worst years of my career for sure and

942
01:15:02.98 --> 01:15:09.06
One because this the school and defense language institute is a phenomenal school. I mean there's there's no other like it

943
01:15:09.06 --> 01:15:16.02
But you it's all you do is study how many hours of day are you in class and how many hours of day do you have to study?

944
01:15:16.02 --> 01:15:24.02
So the class was regular eight hours. It's from nine to whatever and you take a a break for lunch

945
01:15:24.42 --> 01:15:25.78
but

946
01:15:25.78 --> 01:15:27.78
I and

947
01:15:27.78 --> 01:15:32.90
This was one thing I wasn't prepared for and I probably should have studied harder in high school should take an

948
01:15:32.90 --> 01:15:34.90
language but

949
01:15:34.90 --> 01:15:36.90
I would get up

950
01:15:36.90 --> 01:15:44.34
First thing in the morning early like around 4.35 and I would study for an hour and a half before for school

951
01:15:44.34 --> 01:15:45.70
Then I would drive in

952
01:15:45.94 --> 01:15:47.30
Go to class

953
01:15:47.30 --> 01:15:52.90
Take an extra because I think lunch was an hour. Yeah, it was like a like an hour for lunch

954
01:15:53.62 --> 01:16:00.26
But they had a deal with you could spend 30 minutes one on one with an instructor while they ate so you just kind of

955
01:16:00.50 --> 01:16:02.50
Discuss things and

956
01:16:02.50 --> 01:16:09.38
Then you know you eat for half an hour then you start class again finish the day. I would drive straight home study for another two hours

957
01:16:09.94 --> 01:16:13.94
Eat dinner study for another hour and go to bed. I need to do that for a year. I

958
01:16:13.94 --> 01:16:19.78
Well, I did it for about eight months and it took about eight months to fill comfortable enough where I could take

959
01:16:20.10 --> 01:16:25.06
You know, maybe I didn't study that extra hour after dinner or something but I mean they I mean we were learning

960
01:16:25.06 --> 01:16:32.74
50 60 vocabulary words each day and and this isn't a romance language. You know, it's

961
01:16:34.82 --> 01:16:39.38
Completely another leaf foreign yeah, and it's a tall is a tone language. It's tonal

962
01:16:39.38 --> 01:16:43.94
So they have I remember you tell me about six tones so how you say a word

963
01:16:44.98 --> 01:16:49.14
If you think you told me about rice like rice means rice white

964
01:16:49.54 --> 01:16:54.18
Eat and some other things depending oh, it was something like that so the word I use is ma that's

965
01:16:54.18 --> 01:17:03.10
When I tell people about tones so you can say the word ma six different ways and Vietnamese so it's ma ma ma ma ma ma

966
01:17:03.18 --> 01:17:04.86
Ma ma ma

967
01:17:05.58 --> 01:17:11.50
My name is one anyway, but each of those words means something different totally different about how you say it

968
01:17:11.50 --> 01:17:17.70
So one means a rice plant as it's coming up the water another means your cheek another way

969
01:17:17.70 --> 01:17:23.70
Means your mother another way means a horse another way means a ghost or a bit cripple where you bury people

970
01:17:24.18 --> 01:17:26.58
So if you say the phrase like dilemma

971
01:17:27.22 --> 01:17:31.70
You know if I'm pointing to a horse obviously I'm not talking about my mother

972
01:17:31.70 --> 01:17:35.22
But if you say it wrong and someone's just listening

973
01:17:35.86 --> 01:17:42.58
It has a total different meaning but you can say dilemma dilemma dilemma and it means something different each time

974
01:17:42.58 --> 01:17:48.94
So yeah, it's just with took hours of just listening to to

975
01:17:49.70 --> 01:17:51.70
You know cassette tapes

976
01:17:51.70 --> 01:17:56.50
So we had at the time and and some people are better at this naturally than others correct?

977
01:17:56.50 --> 01:18:04.30
I would hope so I wasn't because the amount of hours to towards you know if you compare it with the grades

978
01:18:04.30 --> 01:18:07.30
I was getting I was way overworking

979
01:18:07.30 --> 01:18:13.06
My self but but I learned so I learned how to study was a big one

980
01:18:13.50 --> 01:18:15.62
They actually had somebody who was

981
01:18:16.50 --> 01:18:24.02
Getting their PhD on learning styles or something and they came in and actually worked with this where we took a like a survey

982
01:18:24.22 --> 01:18:31.14
And then she met with us and says okay, you're this type of learning style and what it taught me is like I was wasting my time with with

983
01:18:31.66 --> 01:18:32.66
Flashcards

984
01:18:32.66 --> 01:18:38.30
Because that's what everybody was used in flashcards do this is like this is my my bread and butter is flashcards

985
01:18:38.30 --> 01:18:49.70
So what she told me is you are better off just getting a blank notebook and just writing stuff down over and over kind of like on on the blackboard

986
01:18:49.70 --> 01:18:55.22
You know when you get punished because the way I will not make fun of my comm school instructor

987
01:18:55.22 --> 01:18:58.02
So I will not make a lot of comm school instructor

988
01:18:58.02 --> 01:19:05.58
So I would just listen to conversations and I would hand write it down. I'd you know run it back and that helped me

989
01:19:06.30 --> 01:19:08.30
Kind of on the listening side

990
01:19:08.74 --> 01:19:14.18
you know understand what I'm hearing and be able to to work it but it was

991
01:19:15.14 --> 01:19:21.74
The other bad thing about bad thing about DLI but challenging thing was the leadership and

992
01:19:22.82 --> 01:19:26.22
I know you have a lot of different listeners the Intel community

993
01:19:26.22 --> 01:19:33.98
In my opinion are not you know, they're not necessarily leaders. They're good at getting information putting it in reports

994
01:19:33.98 --> 01:19:37.18
I mean, that's their job leadership wasn't quite it and

995
01:19:38.06 --> 01:19:39.58
the

996
01:19:39.58 --> 01:19:43.50
The people that ran the Navy side of DLI were all

997
01:19:44.70 --> 01:19:46.70
Intel people

998
01:19:46.70 --> 01:19:49.50
That were there for like their short duty and

999
01:19:49.50 --> 01:19:55.30
And most of the students at DLI are all kids right out of high school because they you know, this is

1000
01:19:56.02 --> 01:20:00.78
their job and they score high on a test and they bring them in and say hey

1001
01:20:01.14 --> 01:20:03.86
You're gonna you're gonna study Arabic and

1002
01:20:04.42 --> 01:20:06.42
they're like okay and

1003
01:20:07.26 --> 01:20:12.46
You know, they would do fine for a while and if they failed and they would kind of move them down to an easier language and

1004
01:20:13.18 --> 01:20:17.22
And if they failed that then you know, they it was to the flea tour or whatever and

1005
01:20:17.22 --> 01:20:21.50
And but the leadership at the school was was

1006
01:20:22.30 --> 01:20:26.30
Was challenging because they didn't want to do any of the leadership part of

1007
01:20:26.94 --> 01:20:27.94
Actually

1008
01:20:27.94 --> 01:20:32.50
Reintering and leading so they guys like because I was a

1009
01:20:33.22 --> 01:20:35.22
I made E6 while I was there

1010
01:20:35.62 --> 01:20:39.78
They kind of pushed it to us like okay you're the LPO the Asian division and

1011
01:20:39.78 --> 01:20:46.70
You know, I'm just struggling to study every day and learn my 60 vocabulary words so I can you know

1012
01:20:47.42 --> 01:20:50.42
Talk that day and now I got to deal with

1013
01:20:50.94 --> 01:20:57.90
You know this person over here who you know went out and got drunk last night and you know was under age door crash their car or

1014
01:20:58.90 --> 01:21:04.50
It was just silly little little things and and I'm thinking you know you're on short duty

1015
01:21:04.50 --> 01:21:08.90
Should then that's something you should be doing but but it fell to us

1016
01:21:08.90 --> 01:21:10.18
Luckily

1017
01:21:10.18 --> 01:21:18.42
We had some good representation there some officers and senior enlisted that were going through different languages and

1018
01:21:19.14 --> 01:21:23.38
They put a stop to a lot of that and I'll tell you one story the

1019
01:21:24.18 --> 01:21:26.18
One of the guys was

1020
01:21:26.18 --> 01:21:31.56
He was later our training master chief okay. Yeah, and he was there and I

1021
01:21:31.96 --> 01:21:35.68
Show up so I'm just showing up to DLI coming from team one and

1022
01:21:36.30 --> 01:21:38.30
Got my my white son

1023
01:21:38.30 --> 01:21:40.70
I think I was where we were wearing whites at the time

1024
01:21:41.70 --> 01:21:45.70
Yeah, my try you know I hope business and I walk in and

1025
01:21:46.82 --> 01:21:48.02
The

1026
01:21:48.02 --> 01:21:54.58
The Lieutenant that was running the school. You know, they kind of as you do your check in

1027
01:21:54.94 --> 01:21:56.62
She's like well

1028
01:21:56.62 --> 01:22:00.02
Yeah, I know you're any six, but we have you know

1029
01:22:00.02 --> 01:22:06.34
We your class in and start for a couple weeks so we'll just have you work in the master dorm shack or whatever

1030
01:22:06.34 --> 01:22:09.78
And until your class starts I'm like, oh, okay

1031
01:22:09.98 --> 01:22:13.78
So I go down there and the person working in

1032
01:22:14.42 --> 01:22:16.42
The shack was like an E4

1033
01:22:17.18 --> 01:22:21.46
Who had never been in the real Navy had been at the school the whole time and

1034
01:22:22.30 --> 01:22:29.54
Was failing so they put them in this office to to be the master at arms or whatever

1035
01:22:29.54 --> 01:22:37.30
So I show up again E6 are I was E5 at the time and I walk in and they're like well

1036
01:22:37.58 --> 01:22:41.06
Yeah, we're we're doing some painting of some of the offices

1037
01:22:41.06 --> 01:22:46.70
So paint cans are over there just grab a you know grab a cannon and a brush and you can you know work

1038
01:22:46.70 --> 01:22:48.90
Paint in the office for the next couple of days. I'm like

1039
01:22:50.42 --> 01:22:55.70
Okay, so I walk out and I I see the the master chief and

1040
01:22:55.70 --> 01:22:59.86
And yeah, and he's like oh great another team guy and I talk to him and I'm like hey

1041
01:23:00.14 --> 01:23:04.22
What's a deal with you? They want me to paint in office for the next two weeks. He goes

1042
01:23:04.70 --> 01:23:05.90
No

1043
01:23:05.90 --> 01:23:11.26
Wops into the lieutenant's office shuts the door comes back out like five minutes later

1044
01:23:11.26 --> 01:23:13.26
He says he worked for me for the next two

1045
01:23:14.78 --> 01:23:19.18
So that ended that good stuff now when you came back to team one

1046
01:23:19.18 --> 01:23:26.98
Now it's like 1997 1997 something like that yeah, and you go right into training

1047
01:23:26.98 --> 01:23:35.46
So and that's where I've been now for a year something like so kind of our core group all went to to training and so I was I was gone for a year

1048
01:23:36.18 --> 01:23:38.18
come back and

1049
01:23:38.68 --> 01:23:42.22
I'm kind of you know kind of getting the layout of of what's going on and

1050
01:23:42.22 --> 01:23:49.70
And I see all you guys and you're like yeah, we're in training so we're we're running things

1051
01:23:50.38 --> 01:23:52.38
All right, and

1052
01:23:52.38 --> 01:23:54.34
I'm like yeah, are there any

1053
01:23:54.34 --> 01:23:58.06
Great team one mafia at this point there. We had our hands at everything

1054
01:23:58.06 --> 01:24:00.94
Yeah, and I'm looking at the I'm looking at the platoons. I'm like

1055
01:24:01.46 --> 01:24:06.78
I mean all my friends are her in training cell and so and then I think you and I talk

1056
01:24:07.30 --> 01:24:08.90
because at the time

1057
01:24:08.90 --> 01:24:12.90
I think you it may be started the the

1058
01:24:13.58 --> 01:24:20.82
Combs program yeah, I kind of started yes, I had started but I hadn't run like what I bought the vision

1059
01:24:20.82 --> 01:24:22.82
Yes, but you had vision of course

1060
01:24:24.82 --> 01:24:31.10
So I think we talked about what we could do something something big here and

1061
01:24:31.66 --> 01:24:35.82
I'm like I'm all in I'm all in so yeah, I came back

1062
01:24:35.82 --> 01:24:44.78
The I think the leadership had just turned over in training and we had good people in there the guy from DLI was there and

1063
01:24:45.30 --> 01:24:48.94
It's our I didn't knew he was awesome, so like yep, let's let's do this

1064
01:24:49.62 --> 01:24:57.62
So we end up teaching a bunch of different stuff, but one of the coolest things that we did was we launched a

1065
01:24:58.14 --> 01:25:02.18
Com school for the communicators at seal team one and

1066
01:25:02.18 --> 01:25:08.38
And it was a straw it was kind of hard to get the I don't know if you remember this the hardest thing about getting it

1067
01:25:08.54 --> 01:25:14.02
Actually approved was the amount of batteries it was gonna take the 5590 batteries that cost

1068
01:25:14.30 --> 01:25:17.26
$64 each or something like this and we're gonna have to out fit

1069
01:25:17.90 --> 01:25:22.18
20 guys or whatever it was and our initial answer was no

1070
01:25:22.82 --> 01:25:28.06
No, you you can't have money for those batteries use the rechargeable batteries which were the

1071
01:25:28.06 --> 01:25:32.10
B-A what were they called B-A 55 something else and

1072
01:25:33.30 --> 01:25:40.32
We were like that's that's unrealistic we'd never carry those but they only last but and we ended up fighting and our

1073
01:25:40.78 --> 01:25:42.78
Commanding officer like we pitched the commanding officer

1074
01:25:42.78 --> 01:25:44.94
They're all right approved and we got whatever was

1075
01:25:45.94 --> 01:25:51.38
$4,000 to buy enough batteries to run this exercise and we set up a freaking crazy

1076
01:25:52.30 --> 01:25:54.54
FTx out in the field and

1077
01:25:55.74 --> 01:25:56.74
man

1078
01:25:56.74 --> 01:26:05.54
We weighed the guys I remember we started off by weighing the guys to see how much equipment they had and and they averaged average was what in their

1079
01:26:05.90 --> 01:26:11.62
gear and equipment 120 pounds at least yeah, so the guys are rolling out on a seven day

1080
01:26:12.82 --> 01:26:16.98
Rit two man reconnaissance and we've got how are we how many teams you think we had?

1081
01:26:17.86 --> 01:26:19.86
On that first one six or seven

1082
01:26:19.86 --> 01:26:28.14
Yeah, that sounds about right yeah, yeah, it was probably actually was probably six because it was probably two guys

1083
01:26:28.14 --> 01:26:32.70
Per six platoons at T1 and so there you go. Yeah, here we go rock and roll

1084
01:26:33.10 --> 01:26:36.98
And we took those guys out and it was a ball buster

1085
01:26:38.02 --> 01:26:40.02
Yeah, but it lightly

1086
01:26:41.54 --> 01:26:45.82
So I'm sure some of the guys probably have better terms for oh

1087
01:26:45.82 --> 01:26:51.94
Dude, it was hard so we did up in the southern California mountains. We had a really great target to observe

1088
01:26:51.94 --> 01:26:57.54
It's a military target. There was military activity at the target and that was the key because

1089
01:26:58.30 --> 01:27:00.26
I think what you know when we went through our

1090
01:27:00.78 --> 01:27:06.10
Course all we had I think we're accounting cars on a road or are watching something and

1091
01:27:06.70 --> 01:27:12.36
a lot of the training was you're gonna watch this missile site and it was a piece of PVC by

1092
01:27:12.36 --> 01:27:20.08
Maybe somebody come out once a day and use but we had an active target or stuff was going on all the time and it was important because you knew

1093
01:27:21.36 --> 01:27:27.04
Based on the reports who was actually doing the work because there were stuff to report

1094
01:27:27.48 --> 01:27:35.92
Yeah, it was good and we set up comms shots all over the country and so then the the highlight of this first course that we ran though

1095
01:27:36.36 --> 01:27:39.76
Was these there was a one three man pair

1096
01:27:39.76 --> 01:27:44.08
For whatever reason that always happens in the team's you out of three man pair for some reason

1097
01:27:45.24 --> 01:27:47.24
So there's one three man pair and

1098
01:27:48.16 --> 01:27:52.12
We're monitoring everything. We're not sleeping at all. We're just not sleeping for seven days

1099
01:27:52.12 --> 01:27:54.12
We're like we're just so freaking fired up

1100
01:27:54.76 --> 01:27:56.76
They run into this thing and

1101
01:27:57.40 --> 01:28:00.60
One of the that three man pair misses a calm window and

1102
01:28:01.88 --> 01:28:08.76
So we immediately roll out there. We're like freaking star ski to huts like we got a missed calm window on freaking delta four

1103
01:28:08.76 --> 01:28:12.24
Let's go so we roll out there and

1104
01:28:14.24 --> 01:28:19.72
And we get to their position and pro we this is we just knew too much at our member

1105
01:28:21.04 --> 01:28:26.36
We said like eight you know why we're tripping that calm window and they said something along the lines of like

1106
01:28:26.44 --> 01:28:33.54
Well we tried but the other station was up and you and I looked at each other like because we were monitoring the station

1107
01:28:33.54 --> 01:28:39.18
That what the frequency there supposed to be calm on we were listening to it and we were close enough. Yeah

1108
01:28:39.18 --> 01:28:42.90
Yeah, we would have heard it and regardless yeah like we would 100% would have heard it

1109
01:28:42.90 --> 01:28:46.90
We didn't hear anything so we roll out there. Hey. Why do you guys miss that calm window?

1110
01:28:46.90 --> 01:28:53.70
They go will we try to slide but the other group was not like because we got we got calm to the other group

1111
01:28:54.98 --> 01:29:00.12
So I remember you and I looked at each other. We just I don't know if you said eyes that we're like let's separate them

1112
01:29:00.12 --> 01:29:05.66
Or we like what took us that way like let's separate them so we separate them and we're like freaking

1113
01:29:08.32 --> 01:29:12.76
Who's sure we're like freaking too Sherlock Holmes up in this piece right here?

1114
01:29:13.24 --> 01:29:19.16
And so I remember I go and I said what kind of antennas do you guys set up and he's like oh, we had a long wire and you're asking

1115
01:29:19.16 --> 01:29:25.08
I we come back here. What kind of he says he says invert a dip all this guy says long wire their liars

1116
01:29:25.08 --> 01:29:28.16
So we come back over and like all right

1117
01:29:30.32 --> 01:29:32.32
You guys and tell us the truth and

1118
01:29:34.04 --> 01:29:36.04
There's got to be consequences to that

1119
01:29:37.32 --> 01:29:40.32
So we start making these guys a walk and

1120
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:49.88
Like up hills up the big hills with all their gear and equipment and they start walking and then when they would get to those points

1121
01:29:49.88 --> 01:29:54.60
We've got calls when you get there, but we'd be waiting for them and they still had to make their calm window

1122
01:29:54.60 --> 01:29:57.32
Along the way that's right, that's right and

1123
01:29:58.72 --> 01:30:00.72
The good the cool thing about this

1124
01:30:01.20 --> 01:30:06.44
They they shouldn't have lied and everything, but they were good guys. Yeah, especially that one character

1125
01:30:06.64 --> 01:30:12.000
The one character's like I'm sorry man. We shouldn't lie. It's my father. We shouldn't lie. I'm like yeah cool

1126
01:30:12.40 --> 01:30:14.64
But that's four minutes too late, bro

1127
01:30:15.60 --> 01:30:20.96
And he was a new guy at the time. Yeah, so these guys were just dating life. They knew they'd screwed up

1128
01:30:21.64 --> 01:30:22.64
but

1129
01:30:22.64 --> 01:30:28.48
I remember so we so we they get to a spot that we took like on the top of a mountain and we'd be waiting for them

1130
01:30:28.48 --> 01:30:30.48
And they'd get up there and

1131
01:30:30.48 --> 01:30:32.48
Be like get out your map and

1132
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:37.40
They you just have the look and they're all just get out their map get out your map means we're gonna sign you another spot

1133
01:30:37.56 --> 01:30:42.56
So we'd put point to another top of another mountain and they'd be like Roger

1134
01:30:42.56 --> 01:30:49.40
So we did that to him a few times finally we did one and we opened up the back of the truck put the tailgate down

1135
01:30:49.40 --> 01:30:56.16
And I remember going hey, you know go back it was actually go back to the mountain top

1136
01:30:56.16 --> 01:30:59.40
You just came from and you could hear like a little bit of a

1137
01:30:59.96 --> 01:31:04.04
And I said or you guys can just put your gear in the back of the truck and call it quits and

1138
01:31:04.52 --> 01:31:09.16
I remember that one character good guys exact no no sir. Nope. Oh, he can call me sir

1139
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:13.62
He's like no chocolate's all right. We're going we're we're starting walking good new go fill up your water

1140
01:31:15.24 --> 01:31:17.24
Fill up your water bottles

1141
01:31:17.24 --> 01:31:21.98
What you tell me that guy told you that's like the hardest training he ever did he well

1142
01:31:21.98 --> 01:31:27.08
Yeah, I talked to him a couple of years ago to talk great guy and he's like yeah

1143
01:31:27.08 --> 01:31:32.76
I was still with the hardest train you you should actually have him on your show. I think he's still in but yeah

1144
01:31:32.76 --> 01:31:34.76
It was

1145
01:31:34.76 --> 01:31:40.44
From his perspective. I'm sure he would think differently, but yeah, it was good

1146
01:31:40.44 --> 01:31:47.26
Awesome stuff great training for those calm guys really and that was you know

1147
01:31:47.26 --> 01:31:53.90
You and I were obsessed we realized the importance of comms we've over indexed the importance of comms to you and me

1148
01:31:53.90 --> 01:31:58.78
It was like hey if you can't get comms you can't get extracted you can't get fires, but we just true

1149
01:31:58.78 --> 01:32:02.68
Yeah, it's true, but we were crazy about it kind of crazy. Yeah

1150
01:32:02.68 --> 01:32:09.24
And I should have maybe had to better yeah, I'm sure some people might call it passion some people call it psychotic

1151
01:32:10.36 --> 01:32:12.36
But that's that's how it rolls um

1152
01:32:12.84 --> 01:32:16.52
The true threats, but lies hurt more that was the lesson learned there

1153
01:32:17.36 --> 01:32:19.88
So then you ended up putting for a commissioning program, right?

1154
01:32:20.04 --> 01:32:23.76
So when so this was about the the time that you left and

1155
01:32:25.04 --> 01:32:27.04
I was

1156
01:32:27.48 --> 01:32:32.28
Again, I've been east six for several years now and I was just I was

1157
01:32:32.28 --> 01:32:35.84
Reading the tea leaves, you know, I would I would take the chiefs exam on

1158
01:32:36.84 --> 01:32:39.96
on a job I didn't do did know how to do and

1159
01:32:43.08 --> 01:32:46.68
So I thought okay this this isn't if I got to wait

1160
01:32:47.40 --> 01:32:51.88
Another five six years to be chief when all my friends are making chief then

1161
01:32:52.28 --> 01:32:57.92
Then I need to find another job or another career. I you know this is the time because I was that tip about 10 years

1162
01:32:57.92 --> 01:33:02.64
At that time so you actually wait and get now. You think about it now. Yeah, it was like yeah, this is what 99

1163
01:33:02.64 --> 01:33:06.44
So there's no wars going on. Yeah, you kind of done what you could do

1164
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:09.12
Yeah, yeah, there was you know

1165
01:33:09.12 --> 01:33:12.76
It and hindsight if I knew we were gonna go to war next year

1166
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:17.80
I was that I would not even thought about it, but but yeah at the time I was like okay at 10 years

1167
01:33:17.80 --> 01:33:23.36
If I'm if I'm not gonna stay then I need to go and and do something else. What did you think you would have done?

1168
01:33:23.36 --> 01:33:28.000
I mean I hadn't an electrical background

1169
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.52
I you know, I could get that job at 18 T you were talking about

1170
01:33:34.80 --> 01:33:36.80
Later at this time, you know, I

1171
01:33:37.36 --> 01:33:42.88
Spoke feet in me. I mean I had I knew I could find a job somewhere. I should do something

1172
01:33:42.88 --> 01:33:48.16
But I maybe go back to school and we had the GI bill so I had I had options

1173
01:33:48.16 --> 01:33:53.20
So I go in to talk to to the mass chief same same guy from DLI and

1174
01:33:54.04 --> 01:33:56.56
Because he's now the senior list of for training and

1175
01:33:57.28 --> 01:34:00.08
And I talked to I go look you know this is this my situation

1176
01:34:00.32 --> 01:34:05.76
You know, I love this job, but I I can't sit as an E6 for another five years

1177
01:34:05.76 --> 01:34:08.80
While everyone else is promoting and just do the same thing

1178
01:34:09.20 --> 01:34:10.56
So he's like you know

1179
01:34:10.56 --> 01:34:14.48
Maybe should be an officer like fuck no

1180
01:34:14.48 --> 01:34:21.20
And I go off on this pirate about you know, I'm here to be a matchup

1181
01:34:21.20 --> 01:34:24.16
That's I want to do that job, you know, I I enlisted

1182
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:26.16
I work for a little and

1183
01:34:26.80 --> 01:34:28.80
No way I was gonna get officer and

1184
01:34:29.76 --> 01:34:38.24
He he says after I ramp for a while he goes look and I and you know this guy's very well spoken and I

1185
01:34:38.24 --> 01:34:44.80
I can't say it like he did because I just don't remember it but in essence it was he said give

1186
01:34:46.16 --> 01:34:48.96
Everyone here has something to give to this community

1187
01:34:49.84 --> 01:34:52.48
You just need to find the right medium to do it and

1188
01:34:53.60 --> 01:34:55.84
You know if if the enlisted route

1189
01:34:56.40 --> 01:35:02.56
Is it working because of outside of of you know your what you can do? I mean it's a system you're not gonna change that

1190
01:35:03.36 --> 01:35:07.76
So maybe you just need to find a different way and maybe be an officer

1191
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:09.76
Is the right way to go

1192
01:35:10.32 --> 01:35:13.84
So I said okay, I'll I'll look at at least consider it and

1193
01:35:15.28 --> 01:35:16.96
You adjust I think

1194
01:35:16.96 --> 01:35:21.52
Did you just get picked I got picked up in I left

1195
01:35:22.08 --> 01:35:28.80
Frost yes in 1998 okay, and I had applied in 1997 and didn't get it right and so I had to try again

1196
01:35:28.80 --> 01:35:32.08
Yeah, and I think he had he had he had mentioned that so I

1197
01:35:32.40 --> 01:35:37.04
looked at your program, but there was I think I was too old you're told because

1198
01:35:37.04 --> 01:35:39.04
You wear the same age and I

1199
01:35:39.60 --> 01:35:41.60
Didn't get it my first year and I was like well

1200
01:35:41.60 --> 01:35:45.12
Well, I had some other career choices. I was looking at not they were in the Navy

1201
01:35:45.12 --> 01:35:47.28
I was like okay, well, I'll go to a different command

1202
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.16
But I'll take one more crack at this to see if I can get it and I got it the second time

1203
01:35:52.16 --> 01:35:56.08
But oh yeah, you would have been too old to get that program. I was too old so they had another

1204
01:35:56.08 --> 01:36:03.28
I kind of a legacy program the elicic commissioning program that they were kind of phasing out because they were going over to the

1205
01:36:03.28 --> 01:36:05.28
seamen to have real and

1206
01:36:05.28 --> 01:36:12.24
But it the way you read it I actually could apply for that. I was I was right at the line

1207
01:36:12.24 --> 01:36:14.24
But I could I could still qualify

1208
01:36:14.80 --> 01:36:17.20
So I thought okay, I'll give one chance

1209
01:36:17.68 --> 01:36:24.24
I'll put in a package and we had a guy from the command who actually I did a platoon with who just got picked up

1210
01:36:24.24 --> 01:36:28.32
So I talked to him about it and he kind of gave me some advice on on the package

1211
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:34.72
But I said if if I pick up chief this year regardless of what happens. That's that's the route I'm going

1212
01:36:35.60 --> 01:36:37.60
So I put in the package and

1213
01:36:38.56 --> 01:36:43.60
Go through the whole process and that year they took 300 packages and

1214
01:36:44.40 --> 01:36:47.92
They accepted 150 so I had a 50% chance

1215
01:36:47.92 --> 01:36:51.84
Hmm, I took the chiefs exam that year and I think

1216
01:36:51.84 --> 01:37:01.36
6% advanced to cheating in the Navy so I had a 6% chance of being a chief or at a 50% chance of being an officer

1217
01:37:02.40 --> 01:37:05.76
And I actually got picked up for the program that year

1218
01:37:06.72 --> 01:37:11.36
But the chief results hadn't come out yet and how was determined again if I got picked up for chief

1219
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:16.32
I would just turn down the program but but I didn't make chief that year or so

1220
01:37:16.88 --> 01:37:21.28
Okay, this is where I'm going and then what then what you had to go to college to get that program

1221
01:37:21.28 --> 01:37:30.32
Yeah, so the unique thing about it you had to have prior college to go and the benefit and I joined the Navy right out of high school

1222
01:37:30.32 --> 01:37:33.84
I mean I graduated on Friday that Monday I was I was gone

1223
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:36.96
But when I went to DLI

1224
01:37:36.96 --> 01:37:43.44
That was a DLI is actually a an accredited university and

1225
01:37:44.08 --> 01:37:49.68
They have an accreditation and while you were there if you took a couple of extra classes at

1226
01:37:49.68 --> 01:37:53.36
Monore Peninsula College you could actually get a

1227
01:37:54.08 --> 01:37:57.12
An associate's degree in foreign language so

1228
01:37:57.76 --> 01:38:03.20
You're already in study mode when when you're there so it's like yeah easy. I'll take a couple of short courses

1229
01:38:03.20 --> 01:38:08.96
You know do a lab on a weekend or something and so I did that so I actually had two years of college

1230
01:38:10.24 --> 01:38:15.20
On on my record and that's what I use to get in because they only gave you you had to finish and

1231
01:38:15.20 --> 01:38:21.04
Well, they only gave you two years but you had to be dumb before 31 that was the other problem

1232
01:38:21.92 --> 01:38:28.88
I was gonna be 31 yet to be commissioned before year 31 and I could only only had like three semesters

1233
01:38:29.44 --> 01:38:31.20
But I

1234
01:38:31.20 --> 01:38:33.20
Been through DLI I knew I could study

1235
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Yeah, I was a calm guy. I can do this

1236
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:45.84
So you know it's freaking ridiculous the program I did the program I did I was an E5 at T1

1237
01:38:46.32 --> 01:38:53.84
I packed up my shit. I went to OCS for 13 weeks and then I was an officer at Silting 2 and that was the better program

1238
01:38:53.84 --> 01:38:56.16
It was the freak it was ridiculous

1239
01:38:56.48 --> 01:39:01.92
It's the reason that's why it doesn't exist anymore because it was too good. It was too angry. I agree like you

1240
01:39:01.92 --> 01:39:07.04
There they're I had by the way I had zero college. It was like okay cool. Yeah, go ahead

1241
01:39:07.44 --> 01:39:11.84
Being officer now was like are you I was kind of looking over my shoulder like are you serious?

1242
01:39:12.96 --> 01:39:18.24
Is this happening cool cool right on yeah, it's I feel bad you had to go and

1243
01:39:18.96 --> 01:39:24.80
You know get your DLI done and now you had to go back to college and get a degree man. That's the bad

1244
01:39:25.68 --> 01:39:27.68
I guess the

1245
01:39:27.68 --> 01:39:35.36
First part about it now where you guaranteed to go back to the teams. Yep. I wasn't so I had when I accepted

1246
01:39:36.08 --> 01:39:41.68
It was and it was part of the interview process like well, what if you don't come back to the teams because at the time

1247
01:39:42.08 --> 01:39:44.96
You know again this is the 90s late 90s

1248
01:39:45.68 --> 01:39:49.84
You know they they didn't have that that that

1249
01:39:50.80 --> 01:39:52.32
You

1250
01:39:52.32 --> 01:39:54.32
Opening so I

1251
01:39:54.32 --> 01:39:57.12
Now that you say that and here's the difference

1252
01:39:57.84 --> 01:40:01.28
They took 50 people from the entire Navy for my program

1253
01:40:01.60 --> 01:40:05.12
You know to say so like the chances of getting picked up for my program were

1254
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:07.28
Next to nothing because there was

1255
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:14.40
At least at least a thousand of applications of people. I mean, that's my guess. I'm an official number

1256
01:40:14.40 --> 01:40:18.48
But a lot of people applied for that program because it was such a good program

1257
01:40:18.48 --> 01:40:23.60
It was created and endorsed by the chief of naval operations. I get was a big program

1258
01:40:23.60 --> 01:40:27.20
And it was freaking hard to get picked up. So I guess that's why

1259
01:40:28.32 --> 01:40:33.52
When you look at a percentage why you're not too many people got that program that I got I freaking got lucky

1260
01:40:34.48 --> 01:40:38.88
So for me when yeah by accepting the program I was

1261
01:40:39.68 --> 01:40:47.44
Coming out of the community they let me go to school and but when I graduated and got commissioned as an incident

1262
01:40:48.48 --> 01:40:50.48
They could have sent me to you know

1263
01:40:50.48 --> 01:40:58.32
To swoke school like it is you know you could be a pilot you could be whatever and you had to reapply to get back into the

1264
01:40:58.32 --> 01:41:04.56
Communing which meant I had to take the that PT test day, you know from the all hands magazine

1265
01:41:04.56 --> 01:41:05.92
I don't think it changed that much

1266
01:41:06.24 --> 01:41:10.96
But we had to take that again. There was a couple of other guys guys with me one I saw last night

1267
01:41:11.52 --> 01:41:16.48
But we yeah you had you had to reapply yet to put in your package and

1268
01:41:16.48 --> 01:41:18.48
And

1269
01:41:18.48 --> 01:41:26.48
I remember driving up to DC to meet the detailer and not the uniform one, but

1270
01:41:27.36 --> 01:41:30.24
But the civilian one that really ran things and

1271
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:34.24
Talking to her given her our package. Yeah, hey

1272
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:38.24
We really want to get back as me and in my my buddy and

1273
01:41:38.24 --> 01:41:49.12
And and yeah, but I mean we had good scores because I mean my bachelor's degree after being a DLI was there was a joke

1274
01:41:49.76 --> 01:41:56.08
And I mean and when that's your only job is to go to college because I was still getting my paycheck

1275
01:41:56.48 --> 01:41:57.76
Not any of the

1276
01:41:57.76 --> 01:42:00.48
The special pays or anything but I was getting paid as it was six

1277
01:42:01.36 --> 01:42:06.24
They yeah that's all you had to do was was handing your papers on time which you know

1278
01:42:06.24 --> 01:42:08.24
I had done two three weeks early so

1279
01:42:08.56 --> 01:42:17.12
But so we had strong packages we got picked up and pick back up to go straight in but there was one guy that was in our custodian that did not are you serious?

1280
01:42:17.12 --> 01:42:19.92
Yeah, was he a not was he questionable?

1281
01:42:21.84 --> 01:42:23.84
He did 71 sit ups oh

1282
01:42:26.16 --> 01:42:28.16
Oh, yeah

1283
01:42:28.16 --> 01:42:30.16
You called him out

1284
01:42:30.16 --> 01:42:33.44
So when I was at OCS

1285
01:42:33.44 --> 01:42:35.44
Before I left

1286
01:42:35.60 --> 01:42:37.84
One of the master chiefs at team one

1287
01:42:38.56 --> 01:42:47.04
Said hey when you're getting ready to graduate ace OCS and you talk to the detailer as you just described her the civilian detailer that actually runs everything

1288
01:42:47.04 --> 01:42:48.64
He goes when you talk to her

1289
01:42:49.68 --> 01:42:53.52

So I'm at OCS. I'm whatever three weeks graduation we can finally use the phone

01:43:04.64 --> 01:43:07.44
And we got a square rare or I call the office

01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:15.20
I said hey, ma'am my name is you know juggle willing and I'm about to graduate and I was trying to get orders

1294
01:43:15.20 --> 01:43:18.40
I want to go to I was hoping to go to team two

1295
01:43:18.72 --> 01:43:23.44
And she goes wow yeah, she's like starts going off. I know you know that failed and I'm gonna have to look at that

1296
01:43:23.44 --> 01:43:26.40
And I said and then I listened to her and she was not sending me there

1297
01:43:26.40 --> 01:43:29.12
And then she go and then I said

1298
01:43:29.92 --> 01:43:39.12
Master chief so-and-so I said master chief so-and-so told me to ask you to look in your top left drawer for your orders for my orders and she goes oh

1299
01:43:39.76 --> 01:43:41.76
Where do you want to go?

1300
01:43:42.56 --> 01:43:47.12
And I go team two and she goes okay. I got your orders afternoon boom done

1301
01:43:47.68 --> 01:43:50.16
How's that versus good old boy network activity?

1302
01:43:50.16 --> 01:43:56.40
Yeah, that's so crazy, right? She was powerful powerful powerful

1303
01:43:56.80 --> 01:44:01.36
So and she always took care of me and she took care of me and she took care of all of my friends?

1304
01:44:01.36 --> 01:44:01.92
Yeah

1305
01:44:01.92 --> 01:44:04.88
All my friends. All my friends. She was awesome

1306
01:44:04.88 --> 01:44:07.52
no she was so mean to and when

1307
01:44:07.52 --> 01:44:09.04
So when she

1308
01:44:09.04 --> 01:44:10.80
When we found out that we were going

1309
01:44:11.12 --> 01:44:14.72
We were getting back into the community. She's like I so where do you want to go

1310
01:44:15.60 --> 01:44:19.28
And before I could even say it's like anywhere on that East Coast because I was

1311
01:44:19.28 --> 01:44:24.68
again, you know, I was wanting to go back out to the West Coast.

1312
01:44:24.68 --> 01:44:27.08
I speak Vietnamese, I mean, doesn't that make sense?

1313
01:44:27.08 --> 01:44:29.80
Is that because you'd gone to, could you went to college on the East Coast?

1314
01:44:29.80 --> 01:44:33.56
I did, because I, it was the only school I was, I didn't say that.

1315
01:44:33.56 --> 01:44:39.52
So I had, I had to graduate in three semesters and I wanted to stay on the West Coast.

1316
01:44:39.52 --> 01:44:46.28
So I applied for UCSD and all the look once, got accepted to all of them.

1317
01:44:46.28 --> 01:44:50.72
However, they all said you have to do at least two years, two years minimum.

1318
01:44:50.72 --> 01:44:54.04
I guess that, you know, that's how they get their money, I don't know.

1319
01:44:54.04 --> 01:45:01.76
So I was actually at a point where I didn't find any place that would let me go for three semesters.

1320
01:45:01.76 --> 01:45:07.32
So I actually called the, the guy in charge of the program, you civilian.

1321
01:45:08.32 --> 01:45:10.60
And I said, look, I've tried everything.

1322
01:45:10.60 --> 01:45:16.24
I just, I just can't, because you had to submit like a, a degree plan.

1323
01:45:16.24 --> 01:45:19.08
And I, I, I'm coming up short.

1324
01:45:19.08 --> 01:45:20.32
I, I don't have anything.

1325
01:45:20.32 --> 01:45:22.16
So I got to turn it down.

1326
01:45:22.16 --> 01:45:25.28
I guess, it was called this guy.

1327
01:45:25.28 --> 01:45:29.72
He's retired captain, oh, oh, six captain at Norfolk State.

1328
01:45:29.72 --> 01:45:31.36
See what he can do for you.

1329
01:45:31.36 --> 01:45:35.76
So my guy, calling him up, start telling my story.

1330
01:45:35.76 --> 01:45:40.80
And he likes, I have way, he goes, look, just send me all your transcripts.

1331
01:45:40.80 --> 01:45:41.80
Just fax them.

1332
01:45:41.80 --> 01:45:42.80
Good old boy.

1333
01:45:42.80 --> 01:45:44.80
You little boy net one coming out of your back.

1334
01:45:44.80 --> 01:45:45.80
Just want to get him.

1335
01:45:45.80 --> 01:45:51.08
I fax him all, you know, all my, all my paperwork within 30 minutes.

1336
01:45:51.08 --> 01:45:54.84
He faxes me back a training program.

1337
01:45:54.84 --> 01:45:58.44
And they didn't get, they said, if you can do it in one semester, we'll graduate you.

1338
01:45:58.44 --> 01:45:59.84
And we'll get you commission.

1339
01:45:59.84 --> 01:46:01.04
Oh my, all right.

1340
01:46:01.04 --> 01:46:02.84
So I turned that in.

1341
01:46:02.84 --> 01:46:03.84
I got accepted.

1342
01:46:03.84 --> 01:46:09.68
But yeah, we had to move to Virginia to, to go to school.

1343
01:46:09.68 --> 01:46:13.36
And then once I graduated, it was an East Coast team.

1344
01:46:13.36 --> 01:46:17.08
So when, where were you when September 11th happened?

1345
01:46:17.08 --> 01:46:19.84
So I, I, I was status.

1346
01:46:19.84 --> 01:46:21.52
So I was still a school.

1347
01:46:21.52 --> 01:46:24.16
And but I was in my last semester.

1348
01:46:24.16 --> 01:46:27.72
And it was a couple of a couple of months before graduate,

1349
01:46:27.72 --> 01:46:29.80
because I graduated in December.

1350
01:46:29.80 --> 01:46:34.64
And I remember I was at home, working on a paper.

1351
01:46:34.64 --> 01:46:40.28
And I was listening to, to the local radio station, the talk radio.

1352
01:46:40.28 --> 01:46:46.04
And they came over, says, we're getting some reports, something happening.

1353
01:46:46.04 --> 01:46:48.04
I got up, turn on the TV.

1354
01:46:48.04 --> 01:46:50.72
And, and that's, that's where I was.

1355
01:46:50.72 --> 01:46:56.60
And I remember that day, I was getting phone calls on my, on my cell phone

1356
01:46:56.60 --> 01:47:00.36
from people from all over that I didn't know.

1357
01:47:00.36 --> 01:47:02.28
And they were trying to call somebody else.

1358
01:47:02.28 --> 01:47:04.76
But I guess all the towers were real screwed up.

1359
01:47:04.76 --> 01:47:08.36
So calls were getting directed to people that,

1360
01:47:08.36 --> 01:47:10.72
that it wasn't, because they would, I'd answer the phone.

1361
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:14.12
It's like, it's got there, you know, they're, they're panicking.

1362
01:47:14.12 --> 01:47:15.40
And like, you got the wrong number.

1363
01:47:15.40 --> 01:47:16.52
Because no, this has got its number.

1364
01:47:16.52 --> 01:47:20.40
I'm like, sorry, I don't, I don't know anybody.

1365
01:47:20.40 --> 01:47:22.24
And I got a couple of those.

1366
01:47:22.24 --> 01:47:26.36
But, and then like every other team guy, you know,

1367
01:47:26.36 --> 01:47:28.28
I'm, I'm looking, and I already had orders.

1368
01:47:28.28 --> 01:47:32.16
So I knew what command I was going to by that point.

1369
01:47:32.16 --> 01:47:34.72
And, but I only had a couple of months left.

1370
01:47:34.72 --> 01:47:39.64
So, uh, I wasn't making calls, I, you know, get me there.

1371
01:47:39.64 --> 01:47:41.76
Because I knew I was going there within a couple of months.

1372
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:46.40
So I just had to finish that one semester, graduate, get commission.

1373
01:47:46.40 --> 01:47:49.96
And, uh, and yeah, that day, I got commission.

1374
01:47:49.96 --> 01:47:53.68
I left the university, drove straight from North Oak to Virginia Beach

1375
01:47:53.68 --> 01:47:56.000
and checked into a, tilting four.

1376
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:56.80
And then what was your role?

1377
01:47:56.80 --> 01:47:58.56
It's a team form, you got there.

1378
01:47:58.56 --> 01:48:03.92
So this was another one of the, I found out that kind of the issues

1379
01:48:03.92 --> 01:48:07.84
of the program that the day you graduate.

1380
01:48:07.84 --> 01:48:12.56
Yes, I mean, new butter bars, and some good for it.

1381
01:48:12.56 --> 01:48:16.08
And I'm now a day, a day one.

1382
01:48:16.08 --> 01:48:21.28
Well, all of my, everyone at the team, all the officers, especially the J.O.s,

1383
01:48:21.28 --> 01:48:24.08
you know, they've been a jail for a year and a half.

1384
01:48:24.08 --> 01:48:29.16
Because they had to, you know, finish school, go to bus, go to school, go to ask you to,

1385
01:48:29.16 --> 01:48:30.16
all that.

1386
01:48:30.16 --> 01:48:33.72
So I'm, behind them, technically.

1387
01:48:33.72 --> 01:48:38.36
By a year and a half, even though I've had 12 years in the community at this point,

1388
01:48:38.36 --> 01:48:43.000
I'm, to them, I'm just day one, uh, Ensign.

1389
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.08
And so all the platoons are filled.

1390
01:48:46.08 --> 01:48:49.60
And I show up and, you know, the,

1391
01:48:49.60 --> 01:48:51.08
getting this is right after 9-11.

1392
01:48:51.08 --> 01:48:53.56
So, you know, everything's crazy.

1393
01:48:53.56 --> 01:48:59.000
But things haven't changed enough yet to, where they start deploying, you know,

1394
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.000
people differently.

1395
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.96
We're still sending, you know, people to the different theaters.

1396
01:49:03.96 --> 01:49:06.96
And, uh, and I show up and, of course, I want to get an uplatoon.

1397
01:49:06.96 --> 01:49:08.52
I'm ready to go.

1398
01:49:08.52 --> 01:49:10.32
And they're like, yeah, everything's filled.

1399
01:49:10.32 --> 01:49:13.40
So, uh, we're going to make you the training officer.

1400
01:49:13.40 --> 01:49:18.96
And, which I was okay with because, having been in training, so I can, I can run

1401
01:49:18.96 --> 01:49:19.96
training.

1402
01:49:19.96 --> 01:49:20.96
That's, that's not hard.

1403
01:49:20.96 --> 01:49:25.60
However, at that time, all the training had been taken away from the teams

1404
01:49:25.60 --> 01:49:27.08
and centralized.

1405
01:49:27.08 --> 01:49:29.56
So I was more of a, like, an LNO,

1406
01:49:29.56 --> 01:49:34.92
run the command to the, uh, to the training department, which, again, wasn't bad.

1407
01:49:34.92 --> 01:49:42.28
But, but at that, also at that time, they didn't, uh, they just do like the unit level

1408
01:49:42.28 --> 01:49:43.28
training.

1409
01:49:43.28 --> 01:49:47.64
But the training where you train with the people that you're going to deploy with,

1410
01:49:47.64 --> 01:49:50.16
hadn't happened, or that was still at the team.

1411
01:49:50.16 --> 01:49:54.48
So that was kind of my focus was coming up with a good ORE.

1412
01:49:54.48 --> 01:49:58.24
And, you know, at that, of course, at that time, the big thing was the, you know,

1413
01:49:58.24 --> 01:50:00.64
the weapons of mass destruction.

1414
01:50:00.64 --> 01:50:05.28
So we had to come up with stuff where guys were wearing mop gear and all that craziness.

1415
01:50:05.28 --> 01:50:11.36
But, uh, so that, that was kind of my, uh, my focus during that, that, uh, that first

1416
01:50:11.36 --> 01:50:12.80
work up.

1417
01:50:12.80 --> 01:50:23.08
But then right before deployment, one of the jails of the platoon that's going to Afghanistan,

1418
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:24.08
gets fired.

1419
01:50:24.08 --> 01:50:28.84
Oh, and, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,

1420
01:50:28.84 --> 01:50:29.84
where am I at?

1421
01:50:29.84 --> 01:50:34.84
And I didn't have a job, you know, when you deploy, because the whole team deployed,

1422
01:50:34.84 --> 01:50:40.16
I was just going to be an op-sacist and, but I'm ready to go.

1423
01:50:40.16 --> 01:50:47.24
And so they ended up putting me in that platoon as, as the third O, uh, or, yeah, third

1424
01:50:47.24 --> 01:50:54.52
O at the time, which again, is kind of crazy because I'm 12 years and, uh, I think the

1425
01:50:54.52 --> 01:51:03.76
big learning experience from that was, it was tough for a lot of the other jails, because

1426
01:51:03.76 --> 01:51:11.000
again, we are still sending guys to South America, to, uh, other theaters to, uh, because

1427
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
we still had responsibilities there.

1428
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.56
And here's me who's junior to everybody and I get the one platoon that's going to

1429
01:51:19.56 --> 01:51:21.24
Afghanistan.

1430
01:51:21.24 --> 01:51:28.20
And, uh, so I could tell in the J.O. jungle that, uh, I wasn't their favorite person, but, you

1431
01:51:28.20 --> 01:51:33.60
know, again, I was a lot older than most of them and, and their approval wasn't really

1432
01:51:33.60 --> 01:51:35.32
what I was looking for.

1433
01:51:35.32 --> 01:51:40.20
But, um, but it was, it was, uh, a great opportunity, but there were, there were problems.

1434
01:51:40.20 --> 01:51:46.000
There, and even inside the platoon, there were, you know, some feelings that, uh, you know,

1435
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.20
why did the guy get fired?

1436
01:51:47.20 --> 01:51:50.80
Uh, I don't remember, I wasn't really part of that.

1437
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:56.20
It was, I was something in turn, I never really asked, you know, my, when I showed up to

1438
01:51:56.20 --> 01:52:03.26
the platoon, my thing was, uh, you know, I'm just here to, to do what I can to make the

1439
01:52:03.26 --> 01:52:06.16
platoon better, you know, where we're going to Afghanistan.

1440
01:52:06.16 --> 01:52:09.52
And at this time, that was right when I rack was starting up.

1441
01:52:09.52 --> 01:52:12.28
So a lot of the focus wasn't on Afghanistan.

1442
01:52:12.28 --> 01:52:15.12
Everybody was kind of focused on Iraq.

1443
01:52:15.12 --> 01:52:18.40
And, uh, you know, I'm like, I'm here to help out.

1444
01:52:18.40 --> 01:52:21.68
You let me know how I can do it.

1445
01:52:21.68 --> 01:52:28.000
But again, the hard part, and even for me, you know, I'm not a one-year, instant.

1446
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.60
I have 12 years in and I've done a lot of stuff.

1447
01:52:32.60 --> 01:52:34.96
I've, and it was hard for me at times.

1448
01:52:34.96 --> 01:52:39.72
And this was kind of my first being as an officer in a platoon.

1449
01:52:39.72 --> 01:52:45.04
You know, I had a lot to learn of, you know, you're not, you know, the E6, any more.

1450
01:52:45.04 --> 01:52:48.60
You're one of, one of, one of here when I learned that.

1451
01:52:48.60 --> 01:52:50.04
So I'm at team two.

1452
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:53.88
I freaking have an awesome platoon filled with awesome guys.

1453
01:52:53.88 --> 01:52:56.84
And we're going on a trip and we're building a pallet.

1454
01:52:56.84 --> 01:52:59.20
And we already talked about pallet building today.

1455
01:52:59.20 --> 01:53:00.88
Like, hey, you're going to make a square-to-weight pallet.

1456
01:53:00.88 --> 01:53:06.08
So I'm down there. I'm seeing the pallet being built. And I'm like, hey, we need to move

1457
01:53:06.08 --> 01:53:06.84
this box over here.

1458
01:53:06.84 --> 01:53:09.52
We need to put these rigs over here.

1459
01:53:09.52 --> 01:53:14.32
And I start building the pallet and my LPO, who's a freaking great guy, a great friend

1460
01:53:14.32 --> 01:53:18.48
of mine, Scottie Neal, Navy SEAL who unfortunately passed away.

1461
01:53:18.48 --> 01:53:21.60
But he was freaking great LPO.

1462
01:53:21.60 --> 01:53:26.96
And he looks at me and he goes, hey, sir, I was like, oh, damn, he goes, why don't

1463
01:53:26.96 --> 01:53:29.72
you let me do my job and you go do yours?

1464
01:53:29.72 --> 01:53:32.000
And it was the perfect thing to say to me.

1465
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.52
And I just was like, he's 100% right.

1466
01:53:34.52 --> 01:53:37.64
I'm down here trying to build a pallet.

1467
01:53:37.64 --> 01:53:39.60
These guys, this is what they do.

1468
01:53:39.60 --> 01:53:41.60
This is his domain.

1469
01:53:41.60 --> 01:53:43.84
The LPO is going to run that shit.

1470
01:53:43.84 --> 01:53:45.48
And I was down there stepping on his toes.

1471
01:53:45.48 --> 01:53:54.04
And from that point on, the switch went into my head that if I don't need to be giving

1472
01:53:54.04 --> 01:53:55.72
my input, I'm not going to give it.

1473
01:53:55.72 --> 01:53:59.68
If I don't need to prove to anybody that I know how to build a pallet, no one cares.

1474
01:53:59.68 --> 01:54:01.92
They want to build a pallet as their pallet.

1475
01:54:01.92 --> 01:54:05.16
They want to come up with the navigation route.

1476
01:54:05.16 --> 01:54:06.16
And you know what?

1477
01:54:06.16 --> 01:54:08.92
The hardest one, obviously, is like, oh, they want to come up with a communication plan.

1478
01:54:08.92 --> 01:54:11.76
If it's going to work, if it's a viable plan, we're going with their plan.

1479
01:54:11.76 --> 01:54:13.28
And I'm not going to interfere with it.

1480
01:54:13.28 --> 01:54:19.44
And that's the moment, the exact moment in time when Scottie Neal said to me, hey, sir, why

1481
01:54:19.44 --> 01:54:21.72
don't you let me do my job and you go do yours?

1482
01:54:21.72 --> 01:54:23.52
I was like, Roger that.

1483
01:54:23.52 --> 01:54:24.72
Part of me was a little bit paranoid.

1484
01:54:24.72 --> 01:54:28.44
I think two of like, I want to show everyone that I'm a hard worker.

1485
01:54:28.44 --> 01:54:33.56
Like, hey, I'm here to move and I would continue to do that throughout my career of like,

1486
01:54:33.56 --> 01:54:37.32
oh, if you got stuff to move, I'll move it and I'll keep my mouth shut.

1487
01:54:37.32 --> 01:54:40.52
Because I know you guys don't want to hear from me about how to build a pallet, about

1488
01:54:40.52 --> 01:54:43.52
where to, how to set up the range, about all that stuff.

1489
01:54:43.52 --> 01:54:47.36
That's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the E man's domain.

1490
01:54:47.36 --> 01:54:49.36
And I didn't mess with it.

1491
01:54:49.36 --> 01:54:54.52
As long as there was viable plans happening, we're going with the, with what the plans are.

1492
01:54:54.52 --> 01:55:00.56
So true, and I had a very similar experience, I think, was even with the pallet as well.

1493
01:55:00.56 --> 01:55:05.68
And I was very fortunate that the LPO was just so squared away.

1494
01:55:05.68 --> 01:55:09.72
Just one of the best people I've ever worked with, still a very good friend.

1495
01:55:09.72 --> 01:55:14.96
And, but because I was in his squad, you know, I dealt with him quite a bit.

1496
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:20.72
And we came up with a signal that if I was out of my box.

1497
01:55:20.72 --> 01:55:24.96
So if we were at a meeting, he would like rub his forehead or something.

1498
01:55:24.96 --> 01:55:31.24
And that was like, okay, shut up and just let things go.

1499
01:55:31.24 --> 01:55:35.28
And yeah, just phenomenal guy and, and you need that.

1500
01:55:35.28 --> 01:55:42.80
Because again, it's, it's hard for us that had that background to, to, to, to step back and learn

1501
01:55:42.80 --> 01:55:43.80
that.

1502
01:55:43.80 --> 01:55:44.80
Yep.

1503
01:55:44.80 --> 01:55:50.20
And I, well, when I had, in my second pool tune, I had the, the officer that got fired

1504
01:55:50.20 --> 01:55:54.08
and I had the legendary officer take over.

1505
01:55:54.08 --> 01:55:55.32
And he was super experienced.

1506
01:55:55.32 --> 01:55:57.08
He was a prior senior chief.

1507
01:55:57.08 --> 01:55:59.20
He was a prior senior chief.

1508
01:55:59.20 --> 01:56:03.32
And he didn't put his, he didn't peed in, tell us how to build pallet.

1509
01:56:03.32 --> 01:56:04.60
He didn't tell us how to do anything.

1510
01:56:04.60 --> 01:56:05.60
He asked us.

1511
01:56:05.60 --> 01:56:06.76
He put us in charge.

1512
01:56:06.76 --> 01:56:07.76
He was awesome.

1513
01:56:07.76 --> 01:56:10.000
And as soon as my LPO said to me, hey, why don't you go to your job?

1514
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.56
I was like, man, that's what, that's what the best leader that I saw did.

1515
01:56:15.56 --> 01:56:16.56
He did that for us.

1516
01:56:16.56 --> 01:56:18.36
And I'm going to do that from now on.

1517
01:56:18.36 --> 01:56:19.36
Good little lesson learned.

1518
01:56:19.36 --> 01:56:21.60
So what was that deployment like?

1519
01:56:21.60 --> 01:56:24.12
So you're, you're pretty early into Afghanistan.

1520
01:56:24.12 --> 01:56:25.12
Yes.

1521
01:56:25.12 --> 01:56:26.12
So what year was this?

1522
01:56:26.12 --> 01:56:27.12
Like 2003?

1523
01:56:27.12 --> 01:56:28.12
Yes.

1524
01:56:28.12 --> 01:56:31.72
So it was, it was early, but more importantly, again, everyone was focused on

1525
01:56:31.72 --> 01:56:32.72
Iraq.

1526
01:56:32.72 --> 01:56:37.04
So we were kind of a, like a task unit light.

1527
01:56:37.04 --> 01:56:42.04
So it was mainly a platoon with some supporting people, some headshed guys.

1528
01:56:42.04 --> 01:56:47.68
And we weren't really established yet in, kind of our, our operational sense.

1529
01:56:47.68 --> 01:56:51.36
So we, you know, we were just trying to find work.

1530
01:56:51.36 --> 01:56:56.64
And we did a lot of special reconnaissance, a lot of driving around Afghanistan.

1531
01:56:56.64 --> 01:57:00.04
And non-armored up, humvasion with the doors off.

1532
01:57:00.04 --> 01:57:02.28
It was just too heavy.

1533
01:57:02.28 --> 01:57:04.24
And so we did a lot of those missions.

1534
01:57:04.24 --> 01:57:07.48
We did a couple of direct action.

1535
01:57:07.48 --> 01:57:09.56
And it was, it was a, it was a good deployment.

1536
01:57:09.56 --> 01:57:11.36
Again, I learned a ton.

1537
01:57:11.36 --> 01:57:14.36
I was with really, really good people.

1538
01:57:14.36 --> 01:57:18.000
And, you know, we had our issues just like, like everything else.

1539
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:21.44
But it was a good learning experience from that.

1540
01:57:21.44 --> 01:57:28.96
But the main leadership things and the OIC and I had a couple of words sometimes.

1541
01:57:28.96 --> 01:57:35.72
And it was, again, I think that was, because he told me there was a feeling that, you know,

1542
01:57:35.72 --> 01:57:40.60
I kind of got lucky to be in this.

1543
01:57:40.60 --> 01:57:44.32
And I think he made a comment like, you know, guys, some guys really earned

1544
01:57:44.32 --> 01:57:45.32
to be here.

1545
01:57:45.32 --> 01:57:49.32
And I was thinking, what do you think I've been doing the last 12 years?

1546
01:57:49.32 --> 01:57:53.52
You know, all this, you know, when, when I was in my first platoon, you're still riding

1547
01:57:53.52 --> 01:57:56.56
your huffy bike up and down the street.

1548
01:57:56.56 --> 01:57:59.32
So I try not to take it personally.

1549
01:57:59.32 --> 01:58:03.24
And, you know, it was, it was a lot of growing for me too, because again, it was, it was kind

1550
01:58:03.24 --> 01:58:04.24
of a strange time.

1551
01:58:04.24 --> 01:58:09.92
But, you know, we came back from that didn't, didn't lose anybody.

1552
01:58:09.92 --> 01:58:15.48
And it was, it was a good first deployment to a combat zone, because we got to shake a

1553
01:58:15.48 --> 01:58:17.28
lot of stuff out.

1554
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:23.48
And we weren't really driving, like, you know, like, we were later, you know, definitely

1555
01:58:23.48 --> 01:58:24.92
what you guys were doing later.

1556
01:58:24.92 --> 01:58:29.24
Yeah, that's such a nice gentle ramp up.

1557
01:58:29.24 --> 01:58:34.88
And I had that too, like, even, even literally when I got to Baghdad, my first platoon,

1558
01:58:34.88 --> 01:58:41.16
I was like, the, the, the, the, the SAA, who's a freaking, like, awesome guy.

1559
01:58:41.16 --> 01:58:45.60
His wife used to say that me and him were soul mates, but we just got along, like,

1560
01:58:45.60 --> 01:58:46.60
brothers.

1561
01:58:46.60 --> 01:58:48.12
And, but he was already on the ground.

1562
01:58:48.12 --> 01:58:52.48
And so we showed up in the night we showed up, he's like, hey, we're getting, murdered

1563
01:58:52.48 --> 01:58:55.12
from this area, take your platoon out and go check it out.

1564
01:58:55.12 --> 01:58:57.08
And so we're like, I'm like, okay, cool.

1565
01:58:57.08 --> 01:58:59.84
And basically, he just kind of made it up.

1566
01:58:59.84 --> 01:59:04.84
Just to get us out there, shake out the whatever's get, okay, look, you're in Iraq now,

1567
01:59:04.84 --> 01:59:05.68
get over it.

1568
01:59:05.68 --> 01:59:06.18
It's time.

1569
01:59:06.18 --> 01:59:08.56
And then you came back and he's like, all right, cool.

1570
01:59:08.56 --> 01:59:11.36
Now let's start looking at our first mission, but that's, and then that whole

1571
01:59:11.36 --> 01:59:16.88
deployment was a nice ramp up of, of learning opportunities to learn, going back to

1572
01:59:16.88 --> 01:59:20.60
your point of like when someone says, you're lucky to be here.

1573
01:59:20.60 --> 01:59:29.08
I'll just talk about this on the academy training leaders and, what, it's such a,

1574
01:59:29.08 --> 01:59:31.88
and we actually just talked about this on the underground.

1575
01:59:31.88 --> 01:59:34.52
Uh, just just saying like, yeah.

1576
01:59:34.52 --> 01:59:37.28
Yeah, I agree.

1577
01:59:37.28 --> 01:59:41.52
And it's so disarming to people when you say, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm 100% lucky to be

1578
01:59:41.52 --> 01:59:42.52
here.

1579
01:59:42.52 --> 01:59:43.52
Absolutely.

1580
01:59:43.52 --> 01:59:46.52
And I wish I had that advice.

1581
01:59:46.52 --> 01:59:47.52
Well, I wish I would.

1582
01:59:47.52 --> 01:59:51.16
I wish we had that advice, you know, you're talking to the guy that was telling

1583
01:59:51.16 --> 01:59:55.20
the instructor of our commune of cases, of course, that no, it's Zulu time.

1584
01:59:55.20 --> 01:59:57.80
Zulu is always Zulu is always Zulu.

1585
01:59:57.80 --> 01:59:58.80
I was 19 years old.

1586
01:59:58.80 --> 02:00:00.16
That guy was about 35.

1587
02:00:00.16 --> 02:00:01.88
He was a senior chief.

1588
02:00:01.88 --> 02:00:03.88
He was definitely a chief.

1589
02:00:03.88 --> 02:00:04.88
Yeah, so he's a chief.

1590
02:00:04.88 --> 02:00:05.88
So I'm telling a chief.

1591
02:00:05.88 --> 02:00:07.88
Hey, listen, chief.

1592
02:00:07.88 --> 02:00:09.88
Let me tell you how it is, bro.

1593
02:00:09.88 --> 02:00:11.88
Jocco has got word to put out.

1594
02:00:11.88 --> 02:00:17.44
So yeah, we all, we always, we could go back and maybe forget checks and stuff.

1595
02:00:17.44 --> 02:00:18.84
But that's, that's a good one.

1596
02:00:18.84 --> 02:00:23.40
You know, like, hey, when somebody tells you something, and well, you know, he's like,

1597
02:00:23.40 --> 02:00:25.12
okay, yeah, absolutely.

1598
02:00:25.12 --> 02:00:26.12
It's disarming.

1599
02:00:26.12 --> 02:00:28.64
It's a go way to understand what their perspective is.

1600
02:00:28.64 --> 02:00:29.64
It's a good move.

1601
02:00:29.64 --> 02:00:30.64
It's a hard one to learn.

1602
02:00:30.64 --> 02:00:31.64
It is.

1603
02:00:31.64 --> 02:00:32.64
Because that's a shot, right?

1604
02:00:32.64 --> 02:00:34.92
You're like, look at him literally thinking yourself, are you kidding me?

1605
02:00:34.92 --> 02:00:35.92
Right now.

1606
02:00:35.92 --> 02:00:36.92
It's a total ego thing.

1607
02:00:36.92 --> 02:00:38.96
And I've got right into it.

1608
02:00:38.96 --> 02:00:40.28
But yeah, it's.

1609
02:00:40.28 --> 02:00:43.40
But what was your opt-emple like on that deployment?

1610
02:00:43.40 --> 02:00:45.40
It wasn't not too crazy.

1611
02:00:45.40 --> 02:00:50.64
I mean, we were doing like long patrols, like week long, you know, eight days, nine

1612
02:00:50.64 --> 02:00:53.92
days with resupplys, that kind of stuff.

1613
02:00:53.92 --> 02:00:57.28
So, you know, it was, it was tiring on the guys.

1614
02:00:57.28 --> 02:00:58.92
It wasn't real strong kinetic.

1615
02:00:58.92 --> 02:01:01.16
It was just long, long drives.

1616
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:06.24
And we just drive around and see what we could find and we talked, you know, try to talk

1617
02:01:06.24 --> 02:01:08.40
to people, try to get an idea.

1618
02:01:08.40 --> 02:01:11.96
And the 2000, the IED threat wasn't heinous yet.

1619
02:01:11.96 --> 02:01:12.96
No, no.

1620
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:15.88
And again, we were in non-aparmark humbys.

1621
02:01:15.88 --> 02:01:16.88
We had the doors off.

1622
02:01:16.88 --> 02:01:21.68
You know, so we could easily engage.

1623
02:01:21.68 --> 02:01:27.52
And so yeah, that wasn't, that wasn't big at that point.

1624
02:01:27.52 --> 02:01:29.92
So then would you get what you do and you got home from that deployment?

1625
02:01:29.92 --> 02:01:35.84
So I got home on my, all right, you know, now I can finally do my AOC slot because that

1626
02:01:35.84 --> 02:01:39.64
was, you know, really what I wanted to start at the beginning.

1627
02:01:39.64 --> 02:01:42.40
So you could, you know, do a good mentoring.

1628
02:01:42.40 --> 02:01:46.12
And I get back and say, hey, I'm ready for my platoon.

1629
02:01:46.12 --> 02:01:48.76
And I like, oh, you just did it.

1630
02:01:48.76 --> 02:01:50.28
You just had your AOC slot.

1631
02:01:50.28 --> 02:01:51.80
So it's on a fit rep.

1632
02:01:51.80 --> 02:01:56.56
So now you got away another two years because now, because I'm still behind.

1633
02:01:56.56 --> 02:02:04.08
So my year group is still kind of working their way through SQT at this point.

1634
02:02:04.08 --> 02:02:06.36
And but I've already had my thing.

1635
02:02:06.36 --> 02:02:15.36
So the, the new CEO of the command came in and I, I talked to him and again, it was like,

1636
02:02:15.36 --> 02:02:17.56
how am I going to be relevant?

1637
02:02:17.56 --> 02:02:24.88
So at that time, a lot of people were getting the, going to the Army ASO schools.

1638
02:02:24.88 --> 02:02:27.68
Because that was sort of like advanced special operations stuff.

1639
02:02:27.68 --> 02:02:28.20
Right.

1640
02:02:28.20 --> 02:02:32.88
And so I'm like, right, that's, that's what you, that's what you need.

1641
02:02:32.88 --> 02:02:33.88
Then I'll go it.

1642
02:02:33.88 --> 02:02:37.84
And it was again, nobody wanted to do it because they had to deal with the Army.

1643
02:02:37.84 --> 02:02:39.64
And I knew why.

1644
02:02:39.64 --> 02:02:45.76
And because the, the one school was in brag for like three, two months, three months.

1645
02:02:45.76 --> 02:02:46.80
It was a long time.

1646
02:02:46.80 --> 02:02:48.64
That probably two months.

1647
02:02:48.64 --> 02:02:54.36
And it was exactly four hour drive from Virginia Beach to brag.

1648
02:02:54.36 --> 02:02:58.44
And it was, you know, one of those regular schools you do it during the week and then on the weekend,

1649
02:02:58.44 --> 02:03:00.12
you do whatever.

1650
02:03:00.12 --> 02:03:06.96
I had to, in the beginning, I would drive home for the weekend and then drive back on on Sunday

1651
02:03:06.96 --> 02:03:09.16
for class on Monday.

1652
02:03:09.16 --> 02:03:14.44
And I had to, I stopped driving home because I knew if I went home, I wouldn't go back.

1653
02:03:14.44 --> 02:03:17.16
Because I hated it that bad.

1654
02:03:17.16 --> 02:03:21.44
And it was just the, what part did you hate about it?

1655
02:03:21.44 --> 02:03:25.64
It was just the way the Army ran it, you know, it was kind of protector of the tab type thing.

1656
02:03:25.64 --> 02:03:31.52
And it wasn't just me because there were just a couple of Navy guys and it was mostly Army,

1657
02:03:31.52 --> 02:03:33.32
all SF guys.

1658
02:03:33.32 --> 02:03:38.44
And they'll, I'll grade people and I got along with, with everyone.

1659
02:03:38.44 --> 02:03:45.64
And, but it was, even they were getting frustrated from the silliness and it was silly.

1660
02:03:45.64 --> 02:03:50.92
And, you know, all of us had, you know, what, 12, 13, 14 years.

1661
02:03:50.92 --> 02:03:56.40
I mean, these were senior guys and like, you know, I still got to prove to you that I get to be here.

1662
02:03:56.40 --> 02:03:58.60
I could kind of stuff where they make you improve.

1663
02:03:58.60 --> 02:04:04.04
Just, it was, a lot of the stuff was very subjective and, you know, they would, they would test you.

1664
02:04:04.04 --> 02:04:09.04
So they would fail you on something to see how you, how you reacted.

1665
02:04:09.04 --> 02:04:12.96
And some guys were like, screw this, I don't need this and they would just leave.

1666
02:04:12.96 --> 02:04:15.72
And then, but, you know, they were just kind of wanting to test you.

1667
02:04:15.72 --> 02:04:16.92
So you have to do it again.

1668
02:04:16.92 --> 02:04:20.68
It was a lot of just kind of admin, as straight of kind of stuff that.

1669
02:04:20.68 --> 02:04:24.84
And I was a class leader, which, you know, so I had to meet with them every day and, you know,

1670
02:04:24.84 --> 02:04:26.88
they had to tell me how to take out the trash and all that.

1671
02:04:26.88 --> 02:04:27.88
Whatever.

1672
02:04:27.88 --> 02:04:28.88
Okay.

1673
02:04:28.88 --> 02:04:29.88
Get some.

1674
02:04:29.88 --> 02:04:30.88
Yeah.

1675
02:04:30.88 --> 02:04:34.28
But, you know, I got through it and, and it was good because the, the community was just,

1676
02:04:34.28 --> 02:04:38.56
it wasn't something that we were used to and we didn't really have anybody quality.

1677
02:04:38.56 --> 02:04:40.24
I think it's better now.

1678
02:04:40.24 --> 02:04:41.44
But we needed that.

1679
02:04:41.44 --> 02:04:49.32
And, uh, when we got, on that next deployment to our rack, it was, uh, it was somewhat,

1680
02:04:49.32 --> 02:04:54.40
a benefit to have that, that type of skill.

1681
02:04:54.40 --> 02:05:01.20
And the, uh, so I had a, like a small cell of mostly chiefs, because again, all the battoons were

1682
02:05:01.20 --> 02:05:06.64
filled, but you had, uh, guys that weren't in a platoon.

1683
02:05:06.64 --> 02:05:12.32
So, um, we all just got trained up and then when we deployed, we kind of got farmed out

1684
02:05:12.32 --> 02:05:14.52
to different units.

1685
02:05:14.52 --> 02:05:21.52
And our, uh, command had the PSD, uh, personal security and attachment for the, uh, the top

1686
02:05:21.52 --> 02:05:22.52
five.

1687
02:05:22.52 --> 02:05:26.52
So, this is now, this is now 2005?

1688
02:05:26.52 --> 02:05:28.52
Uh, yeah, yes.

1689
02:05:28.52 --> 02:05:29.52
Yeah.

1690
02:05:29.52 --> 02:05:30.52
Okay.

1691
02:05:30.52 --> 02:05:31.52
That's summer.

1692
02:05:31.52 --> 02:05:32.52
Got it.

1693
02:05:32.52 --> 02:05:33.52
Pretty sure.

1694
02:05:33.52 --> 02:05:34.52
Got it.

1695
02:05:34.52 --> 02:05:40.000
And, uh, so we, my team of guys, again, kind of got farmed out because the army was kind

1696
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.68
of running then at the time.

1697
02:05:42.68 --> 02:05:52.56
So I got put into an ODA house, north of, uh, a bagged at and for about three months.

1698
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:55.08
And because their guy that did that job had the lead.

1699
02:05:55.08 --> 02:05:57.08
Was it on a river?

1700
02:05:57.08 --> 02:05:58.08
There was no.

1701
02:05:58.08 --> 02:05:59.08
There was no.

1702
02:05:59.08 --> 02:06:03.40
I, I, I did some work up there as on a river, because it actually crazier and an awesome

1703
02:06:03.40 --> 02:06:04.40
ODA.

1704
02:06:04.40 --> 02:06:05.40
Yeah.

1705
02:06:05.40 --> 02:06:11.36
But, and, and I have to say that these guys were phenomenal to, to work with.

1706
02:06:11.36 --> 02:06:13.76
And, uh, you know, I get asked all the time.

1707
02:06:13.76 --> 02:06:14.76
I'm sure you do too.

1708
02:06:14.76 --> 02:06:18.48
You know, who's better the army SF or seals?

1709
02:06:18.48 --> 02:06:19.60
I mean, obviously we are.

1710
02:06:19.60 --> 02:06:28.16
But, uh, but, but truly, I mean, these guys were professional, like, awesome professionals.

1711
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:34.48
And their concept of, was a little bit, you know, they just did things a little bit different,

1712
02:06:34.48 --> 02:06:35.80
not better or worse.

1713
02:06:35.80 --> 02:06:41.04
But, uh, they were just a well developed group of guys.

1714
02:06:41.04 --> 02:06:50.36
And what struck me as the, as the most beneficial and what I really admire them, the, the

1715
02:06:50.36 --> 02:06:53.56
leaders, the, so the OIC and they had a senior listed.

1716
02:06:53.56 --> 02:06:56.12
And, yeah, they only had one officer.

1717
02:06:56.12 --> 02:07:05.08
So I show up and, you know, they didn't ask for me, you know, are really, they needed some

1718
02:07:05.08 --> 02:07:07.16
help, but, and I show up.

1719
02:07:07.16 --> 02:07:12.64
And I talk to the OIC and, and, uh, we're about the same age and, you know, we, you know,

1720
02:07:12.64 --> 02:07:14.52
talk for a little bit.

1721
02:07:14.52 --> 02:07:18.20
And so they, they have a meeting of the, the group of the house.

1722
02:07:18.20 --> 02:07:26.40
So, uh, they bring everybody in and, I remember, you know, they kind of introduced me to everybody.

1723
02:07:26.40 --> 02:07:29.72
And, uh, they made a couple of Navy jokes, which was fine.

1724
02:07:29.72 --> 02:07:37.80
Yeah, then the, the senior enlisted, who, again, just a phenomenal individual, he goes,

1725
02:07:37.80 --> 02:07:44.24
so today, Mr. Gifford is, is part of this team.

1726
02:07:44.24 --> 02:07:46.16
And he is one of us.

1727
02:07:46.16 --> 02:07:47.60
And they, they call themselves the Eagles.

1728
02:07:47.60 --> 02:07:49.24
He goes, today he is an Eagle.

1729
02:07:49.24 --> 02:07:52.64
And from as long as he lives in this house, he is an Eagle.

1730
02:07:52.64 --> 02:07:54.64
And you will treating that way.

1731
02:07:54.64 --> 02:08:02.76
And, uh, from, from that whole time there, I felt like I was part of the team.

1732
02:08:02.76 --> 02:08:08.88
And I, you know, even though we didn't go through the same training or anything, I, they brought

1733
02:08:08.88 --> 02:08:12.68
me in and they were just a phenomenal, phenomenal group of guys.

1734
02:08:12.68 --> 02:08:14.56
And how long were you up there working with them?

1735
02:08:14.56 --> 02:08:15.56
About three months.

1736
02:08:15.56 --> 02:08:17.56
What, what were you doing?

1737
02:08:17.56 --> 02:08:22.76
So with this new skill set, which we'll say is pretty much, intelligence, gathering intelligence

1738
02:08:22.76 --> 02:08:25.68
and very, very smethodologies is what you're doing.

1739
02:08:25.68 --> 02:08:28.44
And you are basically helping them gather intelligence.

1740
02:08:28.44 --> 02:08:32.32
So I, I was the primary, like, report writer.

1741
02:08:32.32 --> 02:08:37.56
So when all the information came in, I did the evaluation on it, right, reports and send

1742
02:08:37.56 --> 02:08:38.56
it out.

1743
02:08:38.56 --> 02:08:45.88
The reason that we chose to do that by farming guys out was because of the PSD mission,

1744
02:08:45.88 --> 02:08:49.56
you know, they, they were really relying on, on Intel and heavily.

1745
02:08:49.56 --> 02:08:54.40
Because, you know, they were going out for, you know, public things and, you know, when

1746
02:08:54.40 --> 02:08:57.40
there's a threat, they want to know about it.

1747
02:08:57.40 --> 02:09:01.16
And there were all these units scattered everywhere.

1748
02:09:01.16 --> 02:09:06.80
So we chose certain specific places that we figured there was some, could be some pretty

1749
02:09:06.80 --> 02:09:11.32
hot Intel that could be certain, uh, the top five.

1750
02:09:11.32 --> 02:09:14.60
And they wanted to be able to get that information right away.

1751
02:09:14.60 --> 02:09:20.60
So by having kind of a liaison in those houses, if something came up, then they could,

1752
02:09:20.60 --> 02:09:27.16
uh, we could get the information to our guys, uh, doing the mission very quickly.

1753
02:09:27.16 --> 02:09:29.28
What were the living conditions over there, right?

1754
02:09:29.28 --> 02:09:30.48
It was, it was awesome.

1755
02:09:30.48 --> 02:09:34.88
So we lived in a house in the middle of, of town.

1756
02:09:34.88 --> 02:09:41.84
And then it was adjacent, usually, to a Iraqi military base.

1757
02:09:41.84 --> 02:09:47.68
And then so there were like the deep inside perimeter, you had several rings.

1758
02:09:47.68 --> 02:09:53.68
And, uh, you know, at that house, we used to get hit maybe at least once a week, if not

1759
02:09:53.68 --> 02:09:54.68
more.

1760
02:09:54.68 --> 02:09:57.76
Uh, and, you know, we all just go up to the roof.

1761
02:09:57.76 --> 02:09:59.44
We had stuff everywhere.

1762
02:09:59.44 --> 02:10:01.56
And it was just, you battle until they stopped.

1763
02:10:01.56 --> 02:10:02.76
You know, you weren't moving.

1764
02:10:02.76 --> 02:10:07.76
So you just kept going and, and, until it was over.

1765
02:10:07.76 --> 02:10:13.36
And, uh, so yeah, you had everything right by your bed, and as soon as the alarm went off,

1766
02:10:13.36 --> 02:10:15.20
because we, you know, we always had somebody on watch.

1767
02:10:15.20 --> 02:10:20.60
That was, uh, they, they would send out and everyone would just go up.

1768
02:10:20.60 --> 02:10:25.88
And then, uh, then we would run, you know, our operations from there.

1769
02:10:25.88 --> 02:10:28.20
And then, uh, and we, we did a couple of DAs.

1770
02:10:28.20 --> 02:10:30.80
I did those with, with them.

1771
02:10:30.80 --> 02:10:31.80
And they were good.

1772
02:10:31.80 --> 02:10:32.80
Again, we went out.

1773
02:10:32.80 --> 02:10:35.32
We did some of our partner force that you were working with, with the Iraqi-Zayuron base,

1774
02:10:35.32 --> 02:10:37.72
where the were you guys just doing hits kind of solo.

1775
02:10:37.72 --> 02:10:41.92
We, we did have a partner force, but it, we didn't really use them that much.

1776
02:10:41.92 --> 02:10:43.32
They were kind of on their own.

1777
02:10:43.32 --> 02:10:46.96
I think some of our guys did some, some teaching over there.

1778
02:10:46.96 --> 02:10:49.84
But if we did something, it was, it was pretty much just us.

1779
02:10:49.84 --> 02:10:54.28
And, uh, so I went to, you know, like, I would go to the range with the guys.

1780
02:10:54.28 --> 02:10:57.20
And they would kind of teach me some of their TTPs.

1781
02:10:57.20 --> 02:11:00.84
And, uh, and again, not better or worse, just a little different.

1782
02:11:00.84 --> 02:11:02.68
Uh, but total professionals.

1783
02:11:02.68 --> 02:11:06.24
And, uh, I was able to, to work with them.

1784
02:11:06.24 --> 02:11:09.24
Yeah, that three months and it was, it was phenomenal.

1785
02:11:09.24 --> 02:11:13.12
It wasn't one of the best, uh, best parts of that tour.

1786
02:11:13.12 --> 02:11:20.96
But even on, on the wide scale, just to be able to work with guys from, from that, uh,

1787
02:11:20.96 --> 02:11:23.36
that ODA was, yeah, it was phenomenal.

1788
02:11:23.36 --> 02:11:26.60
So then would, so you're only there for three months, what's doing you got done with that?

1789
02:11:26.60 --> 02:11:29.08
So after three months, they, they were switching out.

1790
02:11:29.08 --> 02:11:31.08
So they were kind of off cycle from us.

1791
02:11:31.08 --> 02:11:36.000
So they had, you know, the same, a length of deployments, but they rotated out,

1792
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.96
that way, all SF wasn't rotating out at the same time.

1793
02:11:40.96 --> 02:11:47.52
So when, uh, they left the new ODA that took over that house, had everybody they needed,

1794
02:11:47.52 --> 02:11:51.52
uh, and apparently Chris Gifford wasn't part of that team.

1795
02:11:51.52 --> 02:11:56.56
Yeah, there wasn't, uh, there was like, we, we appreciate it, but we're good.

1796
02:11:56.56 --> 02:11:57.56
Kind of thing.

1797
02:11:57.56 --> 02:12:00.44
And I, I think it was, you know, kind of more of a headshed thing.

1798
02:12:00.44 --> 02:12:03.16
And, you know, there's, there's no way to force, you know,

1799
02:12:03.16 --> 02:12:06.44
reason to force it on them, you know, I kind of explained to him, you know,

1800
02:12:06.44 --> 02:12:08.12
this is what we're looking for.

1801
02:12:08.12 --> 02:12:11.96
If you get this information, please just send it to these people.

1802
02:12:11.96 --> 02:12:15.64
So I got brought back and, um,

1803
02:12:15.64 --> 02:12:19.24
the, there were two teams deployed at that time.

1804
02:12:19.24 --> 02:12:21.24
So one from the East Coast and one from the West Coast.

1805
02:12:21.24 --> 02:12:23.20
The East Coast team was doing the PDFs.

1806
02:12:23.20 --> 02:12:28.16
The West Coast was doing more, um, connect types done.

1807
02:12:28.16 --> 02:12:35.92
So they needed somebody, um, I think their ops officer had to go back, uh,

1808
02:12:35.92 --> 02:12:38.24
or something, but they needed a spot filled.

1809
02:12:38.24 --> 02:12:43.84
So, uh, Mike Mann asked if I would just go down and work there for a month.

1810
02:12:43.84 --> 02:12:46.56
And, uh, so I, I did that.

1811
02:12:46.56 --> 02:12:50.40
And I was just in the ops shop or in, in the talk, uh,

1812
02:12:50.40 --> 02:12:54.80
running ops, getting all the, you know, the briefs in,

1813
02:12:54.80 --> 02:12:58.24
making sure, and then while they were outside the wire, you know,

1814
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:02.48
make sure we were monitoring the, uh, the operating picture and everything.

1815
02:13:02.48 --> 02:13:06.48
And, uh, that's when your old roommate was, uh, was down there.

1816
02:13:06.48 --> 02:13:07.28
Oh, right on.

1817
02:13:07.28 --> 02:13:10.48
And, uh, and, uh, yeah, awesome.

1818
02:13:10.48 --> 02:13:11.44
Yeah. It was awesome.

1819
02:13:11.44 --> 02:13:12.08
Cause, you know, that's, you know,

1820
02:13:12.08 --> 02:13:14.32
that's, him old team one guy.

1821
02:13:14.32 --> 02:13:14.96
Yeah, yeah.

1822
02:13:14.96 --> 02:13:16.88
Him and me got to do missions, man, together.

1823
02:13:16.88 --> 02:13:17.28
Really?

1824
02:13:17.28 --> 02:13:17.60
Yeah.

1825
02:13:17.60 --> 02:13:23.92
And there was like a weird, confluence of events that happened for a short period of time.

1826
02:13:23.92 --> 02:13:27.44
And we were like out in the middle of Iraq together just doing ops.

1827
02:13:27.44 --> 02:13:29.36
It was pretty freaking cool, man.

1828
02:13:29.36 --> 02:13:33.44
Yeah, he, uh, I did, we did one mission together.

1829
02:13:33.44 --> 02:13:40.96
It was, it was kind of a circus, but it was a, the target that I was like right outside the gate.

1830
02:13:40.96 --> 02:13:42.40
And I mean, you can almost see it.

1831
02:13:42.40 --> 02:13:46.48
If you look over the wall from, from the, uh, from the compound,

1832
02:13:46.48 --> 02:13:47.68
you could see the, the target.

1833
02:13:47.68 --> 02:13:49.84
I mean, it was, it was pretty close.

1834
02:13:49.84 --> 02:13:57.60
And, uh, for some reason, people came out of the woodwork to go on this up.

1835
02:13:57.60 --> 02:14:02.56
So we had, like officers and cheese and AstraZeneca.

1836
02:14:02.56 --> 02:14:04.000
I thought you were talking about enemy personnel,

1837
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:04.88
not on how the woodwork.

1838
02:14:04.88 --> 02:14:06.08
I'm like, no, here we go.

1839
02:14:06.08 --> 02:14:07.68
It's like, no, no, we had,

1840
02:14:07.68 --> 02:14:08.56
and hangers go lower.

1841
02:14:08.56 --> 02:14:13.12
We had a lot of people who needed to experience,

1842
02:14:13.12 --> 02:14:16.24
hmm, to outside the wire.

1843
02:14:16.24 --> 02:14:18.000
And so they were going to be on this thing.

1844
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.24
And, uh, they're all looking at the con ops.

1845
02:14:20.24 --> 02:14:22.08
Like, hey, tell me, do you, do you, do you,

1846
02:14:22.08 --> 02:14:23.52
do you, 1200 yards away?

1847
02:14:23.52 --> 02:14:24.80
Let's, let's get on that one.

1848
02:14:24.80 --> 02:14:25.36
Yeah.

1849
02:14:25.36 --> 02:14:30.08
And, uh, so, we're, we're, you know, the op, we get out there,

1850
02:14:30.08 --> 02:14:33.04
and it's just a clown show because people run everywhere.

1851
02:14:33.04 --> 02:14:38.08
So I look over at our, uh, friend, and he looks at me, he goes,

1852
02:14:38.08 --> 02:14:39.04
come with me.

1853
02:14:39.04 --> 02:14:43.28
So we go to like this, uh, barrier position, you know,

1854
02:14:43.28 --> 02:14:47.28
we're kind of on the edge as a, uh, as a, you know, blocking position.

1855
02:14:47.28 --> 02:14:49.04
Because we are away from everybody.

1856
02:14:49.04 --> 02:14:51.04
And we're like, we're going to sit this one out.

1857
02:14:51.04 --> 02:14:53.44
We're going to sit right here until all this is over.

1858
02:14:54.32 --> 02:15:01.12
And, uh, you know, it was a dry hole or whatever, but it was, uh, yeah, it was, yeah, it's funny.

1859
02:15:01.12 --> 02:15:05.20
He's, he's like a real life Sam Elliott with his attitude.

1860
02:15:05.20 --> 02:15:06.40
Definitely just like, yeah.

1861
02:15:06.40 --> 02:15:07.68
Well, we're not doing that.

1862
02:15:07.68 --> 02:15:10.64
You know, just like just a freaking classic.

1863
02:15:10.64 --> 02:15:13.44
And then, and so, so you were done with that,

1864
02:15:13.44 --> 02:15:15.28
but that's still, you saw it more on the deployment, right?

1865
02:15:15.28 --> 02:15:18.40
So a couple of months left, I go back to the PSD mission.

1866
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:20.48
And we, we just help out there.

1867
02:15:20.48 --> 02:15:25.60
You know, we still heavily, a zons to some of the outside units.

1868
02:15:25.60 --> 02:15:28.48
Of course, all the OGA's and all that.

1869
02:15:28.48 --> 02:15:34.64
So I spent two months just kind of bouncing around and just helping out in, in,

1870
02:15:34.64 --> 02:15:37.20
in ops there just to try to get everything out.

1871
02:15:37.20 --> 02:15:40.48
I don't think I did any more missions or anything.

1872
02:15:40.48 --> 02:15:42.16
Most of that was that first three months.

1873
02:15:42.16 --> 02:15:45.12
So it was just, and then, you know, of course right before you leave,

1874
02:15:45.12 --> 02:15:47.84
now all the rewards, all the rewards have to be written.

1875
02:15:47.84 --> 02:15:50.64
And all the, you know, fit reps need to be done.

1876
02:15:50.64 --> 02:15:55.12
So I, uh, I was, I was part of that, uh, you got your answer.

1877
02:15:55.12 --> 02:15:56.72
I was a group.

1878
02:15:57.68 --> 02:15:59.04
And then you would you do after that?

1879
02:15:59.04 --> 02:16:02.32
So we got back from that deployment.

1880
02:16:03.20 --> 02:16:08.24
And, uh, and I'm still not up with my, uh, my year group.

1881
02:16:08.24 --> 02:16:16.88
So I talked to the, the CO and, and he recommended it or, but he's like,

1882
02:16:16.88 --> 02:16:20.56
well, I don't, I don't know, you go to Germany for a couple of years that you can do, uh,

1883
02:16:20.56 --> 02:16:23.20
the CO had been in Germany before.

1884
02:16:23.20 --> 02:16:24.96
Oh yeah, I started, you know who he is.

1885
02:16:24.96 --> 02:16:31.12
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely one of the top five.

1886
02:16:31.12 --> 02:16:35.20
But he, uh, he's like, you know, you should go out there, you'll enjoy it.

1887
02:16:35.20 --> 02:16:41.20
And, and I remember he told me, you know, if you live on base,

1888
02:16:41.20 --> 02:16:45.92
I will come out there and punch you because he's like, you need to get out and town,

1889
02:16:46.56 --> 02:16:53.92
live amongst the, uh, the populace, the populace and experience living overseas like you should.

1890
02:16:53.92 --> 02:16:57.84
I went to his house when he was living overseas in Germany.

1891
02:16:59.04 --> 02:17:02.64
And it was absolutely freaking epic.

1892
02:17:02.64 --> 02:17:05.92
I wish I had taken pictures. I wish I knew the name of the village of the house because it's

1893
02:17:05.92 --> 02:17:10.16
still there. It was like one of these postcard villages.

1894
02:17:10.16 --> 02:17:18.08
Yeah. And he had this crazy, like, old house that was completely like gutted and modernized inside.

1895
02:17:18.64 --> 02:17:23.04
It was freaking. Very just. Yeah. It was freaking badass. Yeah. So,

1896
02:17:23.04 --> 02:17:27.20
him and by the way, like everything that guy does is like all dialed it.

1897
02:17:27.20 --> 02:17:30.40
Yeah. I remember I was going to his house. He's like, hey, you need to wear a shirt. I'm like, bro,

1898
02:17:30.40 --> 02:17:33.60
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't wear a shirt. He's like, no, a shirt. Like a,

1899
02:17:33.60 --> 02:17:38.56
like an actual human shirt, not a freaking. Do just through t-shirt, you idiot. And I was like,

1900
02:17:38.56 --> 02:17:42.40
I was like, I don't have any shirts. And he goes, all right, come, and he opens up his closet.

1901
02:17:42.40 --> 02:17:49.84
Closet is like a, a room. And he's got no kidding hanging up, just button down,

1902
02:17:49.84 --> 02:17:54.88
whatever, really nice shirts in the color of like the rainbow. Like starting with,

1903
02:17:54.88 --> 02:18:01.44
what is it? Red, orange, yellow, green blue purple with with freaking nine shirts of red. And

1904
02:18:01.44 --> 02:18:07.12
it goes all the way through. And I'm like, bro, are you freaking James Bond? What? I don't even have

1905
02:18:07.12 --> 02:18:14.000
eye shirt, much less 49 shirts of very in colors. But yeah, that was all on this completely

1906
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:20.56
dialed house overlooking this green, blushered valley. It was crazy, beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.

1907
02:18:20.56 --> 02:18:27.84
And again, a phenomenal person. And for what he's done for the community. And yeah, just just a

1908
02:18:27.84 --> 02:18:34.000
great guy. So he convinced me this would be a good, a good place to go. And he was right.

1909
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.96
It was what probably might one of my best tours. Because you, you move your family out there.

1910
02:18:38.96 --> 02:18:46.56
And you know, you're, you're part of not, not the war necessarily, because it's, it's not in that

1911
02:18:46.56 --> 02:18:52.56
AO. But you know, you're still doing really good good stuff. And at that time, you know, Africa

1912
02:18:52.56 --> 02:19:00.80
was really starting to pick up. So I was able to be there as that was kind of starting and

1913
02:19:00.80 --> 02:19:08.48
again with my, my background. And you know, these, these Intel type type schools, it was, it was a

1914
02:19:08.48 --> 02:19:18.32
very good fit. So I worked in the, as a task officer there at the unit. And we were moving

1915
02:19:18.32 --> 02:19:24.48
guys down to Africa. So we would, we would send guys, you know, they would basically check into

1916
02:19:24.48 --> 02:19:30.40
the unit in Germany and then move straight to Africa for four to six months, sometimes. And,

1917
02:19:30.40 --> 02:19:35.44
you know, working through embassies. So that was my experience of, you know, starting to,

1918
02:19:35.44 --> 02:19:41.52
to deal health, the State Department works and how all these other good times. Oh, yeah.

1919
02:19:41.52 --> 02:19:47.92
Yeah, that was, you know, when you, when you, when you're retiring, you know what you don't want to do.

1920
02:19:48.88 --> 02:19:53.60
That, that was one of, I, I knew I did not want to, State Department wasn't in my,

1921
02:19:54.40 --> 02:19:57.28
but they're good people. They do, they do a hard job. They really do.

1922
02:19:58.32 --> 02:20:02.32
So you, you wrap up that's one of the, what's out of two year billet? It's a two year billet.

1923
02:20:02.32 --> 02:20:08.96
And I was there exactly two years. We left almost, I mean, exactly two years. And, uh,

1924
02:20:08.96 --> 02:20:12.48
and now it must be time for your platoon commander tour because you already knocked out your AOS.

1925
02:20:12.48 --> 02:20:19.84
Yeah. So my, everything now I'm aligned with, with the rest of my year group. So, uh, so I get sent

1926
02:20:19.84 --> 02:20:24.32
to a team tent to do a platoon commander. And,

1927
02:20:24.32 --> 02:20:33.84
the, because I came from, I think, because I came from Germany and I understood how

1928
02:20:34.72 --> 02:20:39.84
the Africa com and you com work, I can see where this is going. That, they put me into that task.

1929
02:20:39.84 --> 02:20:44.16
And, and again, I was fine with that because, you know, I'm here to support the effort.

1930
02:20:44.72 --> 02:20:49.52
Nobody wants to do it. Then, you know, I don't have any buy breeding down my neck trying to get my spot.

1931
02:20:49.52 --> 02:20:54.48
So, I'm, I'm finally getting my platoon commander and I'm, I'm just stoked about it.

1932
02:20:55.28 --> 02:21:02.80
So I show up to, uh, team tent and, uh, I get in the task unit and I, kind of get an indication,

1933
02:21:03.36 --> 02:21:12.64
pretty soon that, the, all the guys that just came back were in, I think was Iraq.

1934
02:21:13.52 --> 02:21:17.68
Yeah, I think they, they, they came in from Iraq. Me was African as they had, but they just come back.

1935
02:21:17.68 --> 02:21:26.32
They had a really good deployment, high energy intensive, and, uh, but now they are on the U-com.

1936
02:21:26.96 --> 02:21:32.96
And we had a bunch of, you know, new guys who never, I hadn't deployed yet, and they're on U-com.

1937
02:21:32.96 --> 02:21:38.56
And they're seeing all their friends getting ready to go to Afghanistan, Iraq, as I think we're,

1938
02:21:38.56 --> 02:21:45.04
we're still sending people to both. So, yeah, there was that kind of idea that, you know,

1939
02:21:45.04 --> 02:21:52.96
what, that's where we want to be, and I get that. But, uh, as our, uh, mutual chief,

1940
02:21:52.96 --> 02:22:00.32
used to say, uh, you know, orders aren't imitations. They're, they're orders. And this is what you're given.

1941
02:22:00.32 --> 02:22:06.32
And you need to, it's, it's our responsibility as the leadership to make sure our guys are,

1942
02:22:06.32 --> 02:22:12.32
are ready for that. And that's, that's what I was doing. But, there was a lot of, you know,

1943
02:22:12.32 --> 02:22:16.48
if we do really well, then, you know, we'll get move over to here, some I will get fired,

1944
02:22:16.48 --> 02:22:21.20
and, you know, we'll, we'll be able to take that mission. And, and again, there's always that chance.

1945
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:25.20
And, but there's also the chance you're going to do with the, the work you were assigned to.

1946
02:22:25.20 --> 02:22:29.92
What you were assigned to do. So, we really need to focus on that. And there, there was a big,

1947
02:22:31.52 --> 02:22:36.24
I guess, kind of rub between, you know, me and, and the leadership. And it's,

1948
02:22:36.24 --> 02:22:39.92
especially being in Germany for two years, I, I, I saw platoons come out all the time.

1949
02:22:39.92 --> 02:22:46.96
And you can tell the ones that were ready to do the mission and accepting. And they did a great job.

1950
02:22:46.96 --> 02:22:51.60
And then the ones that are like, hey, we're just sitting here until we get the word that we're going in.

1951
02:22:52.56 --> 02:22:57.84
And guess what, the word never comes. You know, I mean, I get it. They made take ones or two,

1952
02:22:57.84 --> 02:23:02.96
because somebody gets hurt, but, you know, we have a mission too here. So, there was a big,

1953
02:23:04.40 --> 02:23:08.88
leadership challenge on my side is, you know, I need to keep the guys motivated and arrested.

1954
02:23:08.88 --> 02:23:12.40
And this job, and I would tell me, you know, there's, there's good stuff going on. There's,

1955
02:23:12.40 --> 02:23:18.000
there's really important stuff. And, and for the most part, I think the guys accepted that.

1956
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:23.68
Some, some didn't, but, but, yeah, that's, it's a tough, tough thing to work through.

1957
02:23:23.68 --> 02:23:30.64
I remember one thing that I was, I always stuck in my mind. There was a, a, a

1958
02:23:30.64 --> 02:23:40.16
Master G faculty. So, Master G faculty, who died in 2017, but he was a huge, had a big impact on all of us.

1959
02:23:40.16 --> 02:23:45.04
The team won at that time. But I remember him telling me a story that there was a Vietnam guy that had

1960
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:53.36
come home that had done like a pretty heroic, a deployment in Vietnam. And that guy was facts like LPO.

1961
02:23:53.36 --> 02:24:02.96
And they're out in the desert, doing the desert warfare training. And that guy who was like the combat

1962
02:24:02.96 --> 02:24:10.000
vet, he was like, they're out on patrol. And he had his like rifle up over shoulder,

1963
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.72
then just kind of like walking like it didn't matter. And, and he just, and he was, he, I think he was

1964
02:24:16.72 --> 02:24:24.08
the Paltune Chief. And you could see the just disappointment as FAC was telling me this story.

1965
02:24:24.96 --> 02:24:30.24
And it was one of those things that, again, he probably told me that when I was 22 or 23,

1966
02:24:30.24 --> 02:24:39.28
I never forgot that fact, not only of, hey, don't be the guy that's like been there done that.

1967
02:24:39.28 --> 02:24:44.000
I don't need to be fired up for training anymore. But also, what an impact that has on

1968
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:52.16
everybody else. And you don't want to be like that. Then fast forward, however many years,

1969
02:24:52.16 --> 02:25:00.32
I was now at Tray that West Coast Tray that. And I had a guy that's a great guy. And he was in,

1970
02:25:00.32 --> 02:25:05.68
he was in Ramadi with me as a new guy. And now he's in his second platoon. And we're out at the

1971
02:25:05.68 --> 02:25:14.48
Mount Facility. And like, you know, it's we're training hard and kicking ass in bubblebaw. And I talked

1972
02:25:14.48 --> 02:25:22.64
him about whatever, but I remember him saying to me, he says, uh, I'm kind of getting burned out.

1973
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.44
And this is during Mount Training in his second platoon. And I'm like, I just, I go, hey, bro,

1974
02:25:29.44 --> 02:25:34.16
you remember when you and I were in a work up together? And he goes, yeah, and I go, that was my

1975
02:25:34.16 --> 02:25:40.32
seventh work up. And he was like, he just got that look on his face. And he goes, Roger that.

1976
02:25:40.32 --> 02:25:45.68
Because I was fired up in my seventh freaking time to go. Let's rock and roll. Like,

1977
02:25:45.68 --> 02:25:52.96
every taking everything seriously. And that's just what you want to do. So that infection can spread.

1978
02:25:54.32 --> 02:25:58.80
And it's a hard pill as well. Team guys want to go to combat. Just what they want to do. And

1979
02:25:58.80 --> 02:26:05.52
when they don't get the chance, it hurts. And but like you said, you got to pick it up. Okay,

1980
02:26:05.52 --> 02:26:09.52
this is what we're doing. Let's do it through the best of our ability. And the only thing you

1981
02:26:09.52 --> 02:26:15.28
do is just keep going on deployments. Like, the God of War is going to do what he's going to do.

1982
02:26:15.28 --> 02:26:20.88
And hopefully you get blessed by him. And if that happens, great. And if it doesn't happen,

1983
02:26:21.52 --> 02:26:27.60
keep working because he's watching. That's the way I look at it. Yeah. And you, and you saw it,

1984
02:26:27.60 --> 02:26:33.84
you know, guys would, you know, kind of have to get through that rotation. But then the next one,

1985
02:26:33.84 --> 02:26:39.84
they go back or, you know, they get another shot at the combat. And, you know, we all knew

1986
02:26:39.84 --> 02:26:44.72
eventually it was going to calm down anyway. But nobody knows when. And you don't want to miss it.

1987
02:26:44.72 --> 02:26:48.96
You want to miss it. And I really felt for the new guys because, you know, all they're seeing

1988
02:26:48.96 --> 02:26:54.08
is their friends that are going and they didn't do anything wrong. And that was really a

1989
02:26:54.08 --> 02:27:03.20
big kind of complaint that I had about how it was perceived is, you know, we're waiting for,

1990
02:27:03.20 --> 02:27:07.20
you know, if they get into trouble, then we get into that spot. It's like, well, so are we here?

1991
02:27:07.20 --> 02:27:10.96
Because we got in trouble, you know, how do we end up paying? How do we hoping that our teammates

1992
02:27:10.96 --> 02:27:16.64
are screwed up? Yeah. Because that's not a good attitude. So we get that spot. So I, you know,

1993
02:27:16.64 --> 02:27:22.96
my thing was, look, again, the war is bigger than just what's going on in St. Com.

1994
02:27:22.96 --> 02:27:30.40
We have a mission to do. It's a good mission. It has value. And, you know, thinking back,

1995
02:27:30.40 --> 02:27:36.72
you know, maybe I could have done better on certain things. But, but yeah, I mean, it was,

1996
02:27:36.72 --> 02:27:45.76
it was what it was. And we actually had a good deployment. I took a crew of people to Africa.

1997
02:27:45.76 --> 02:27:51.92
And we were there for several months. And we, we did good stuff. And, you know, I like to think

1998
02:27:51.92 --> 02:27:57.36
that we, you know, move the needle, hopefully a little bit. But, but it was, yeah, you know, I think,

1999
02:27:57.36 --> 02:28:02.56
and I think most people that were with us kind of got that after a while. And then what you

2000
02:28:02.56 --> 02:28:09.60
do when you got home from that deployment? So I got home. And so I'm looking at to you,

2001
02:28:09.60 --> 02:28:21.20
to Amanda. And, but I didn't want to stay at Team 10 for different reasons. But, but those

2002
02:28:21.20 --> 02:28:27.84
positions were already filled. So it's like, okay, I need to move on. And so now I'm, I'm caught up

2003
02:28:27.84 --> 02:28:34.32
to my year group. But it's still a little bit different because I've had all these other experiences

2004
02:28:34.32 --> 02:28:40.80
and because of a lot of the, you know, victim of my own success. A lot of the schools I went to kind

2005
02:28:40.80 --> 02:28:48.88
of put me on a little bit of a different track, which was fine. And so I end up taking a,

2006
02:28:51.12 --> 02:28:58.48
an opt tour at another command there in Virginia. And which was great. And again, great experiences

2007
02:28:58.48 --> 02:29:07.36
and everything. But it's, it's kind of where I was when that was coming to an end, they,

2008
02:29:07.92 --> 02:29:15.76
I met with the detailer. So now I'm at 21 years, 21 and a half years. And I met with the detailer.

2009
02:29:15.76 --> 02:29:22.80
And I wanted to take over East Coast training, the CEO of that kind of, what you did, but on,

2010
02:29:22.80 --> 02:29:28.80
on the East Coast. And I knew the guy that had the position, good friend. And I talked to him about it. He's like,

2011
02:29:28.80 --> 02:29:36.48
oh yeah, you would do great here. And it, it lined up. And so I talked to the detailer and it goes,

2012
02:29:37.52 --> 02:29:44.88
you need more joint time. I'm like, okay. Which means, you know, you get orders to probably Tampa.

2013
02:29:45.76 --> 02:29:52.56
And you move your family there. And at least at the time, the new deploy overseas for a year,

2014
02:29:52.56 --> 02:29:59.92
her so, and right reports for others. And it worked on your JMP and, you know, all that. And

2015
02:30:00.64 --> 02:30:07.28
your family sits there and, because it's a PCS move. And at the time, you know, my wife had a great

2016
02:30:07.28 --> 02:30:12.80
job in Virginia. She was working for the, the governor's office. And, you know, she wasn't really

2017
02:30:12.80 --> 02:30:18.72
wanting to move. So I was like, oh, go, you know, maybe I can do kind of a batch or kind of thing.

2018
02:30:18.72 --> 02:30:27.52
And, but then I thought, you know, it's, I had 21 years. And I think maybe this is time that I find

2019
02:30:27.52 --> 02:30:33.20
something else. And I was very fortunate that Navy was great to me. I got to do everything that I wanted

2020
02:30:33.20 --> 02:30:40.72
to do. I had a great career. And I, I felt like I had closure. And I don't, you know, put it on the

2021
02:30:40.72 --> 02:30:47.36
detailer. I mean, he's, he's trying to fill these buildings. And for an officer at 10, 11 years,

2022
02:30:47.36 --> 02:30:54.32
that is a great move. And, you know, that's going to set you up for your ex-O tour and, you know,

2023
02:30:55.04 --> 02:31:00.88
probably another staff job in, in CO. But, you know, I wasn't an officer at 12 years. I was an

2024
02:31:00.88 --> 02:31:10.72
officer at 21, 22 years. And I just, I just felt it was, it was time to, to retire and try something else.

2025
02:31:10.72 --> 02:31:17.44
And, so, I went home and talked to my wife about it. And she's like, uh, I was like, yeah, I'm thinking

2026
02:31:17.44 --> 02:31:24.56
about retiring. She's like, okay, whatever. Going Monday, dropped my, uh, my paperwork to, uh,

2027
02:31:24.56 --> 02:31:29.36
to retire. And went back and like, okay, I did. She goes, what'd you do? I like retired. She goes,

2028
02:31:29.36 --> 02:31:35.28
you did what? It's like, yeah, yeah, I did it. How long was it between, when you dropped your papers

2029
02:31:35.28 --> 02:31:40.16
and when you actually retired? Probably about six months or so, yeah, you have to, I had a lot of,

2030
02:31:40.16 --> 02:31:47.60
you know, leave, built up that I need to get rid of. And, um, I had made Lieutenant Commander,

2031
02:31:47.60 --> 02:31:54.88
but because I wasn't doing the full time, they, they didn't commit, you know, go to that next step.

2032
02:31:54.88 --> 02:32:00.000
And then I just retired to say, yeah, that's Lieutenant. Oh, those savages. Well, you know,

2033
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000
they're like, you know, you have to do another three years. And honestly, I did the math.

2034
02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:11.84
Yeah. And they're going from O3E to O4 is not that big of a jump. They ain't going from a regular

2035
02:32:11.84 --> 02:32:17.04
O3, especially when you have, you know, 20 some years. And the math, I think I would have gotten

2036
02:32:17.04 --> 02:32:24.000
maybe an extra $100 on my retirement. And it just wasn't worth another three years. I felt like

2037
02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.40
that one, you know, I could do something else. So how was the transition? What'd you do next?

2038
02:32:28.40 --> 02:32:36.000
Well, so it was a lot harder than I thought it would be because, you know, again, this, we grew up

2039
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:41.68
in the siltings. And we all, I mean, that's, that's what we knew, that's what we did. And, uh,

2040
02:32:42.56 --> 02:32:48.24
even even to this day, you know, I tell people, I still have dreams that I'm still in uniform.

2041
02:32:48.80 --> 02:32:54.96
And, you know, I'm, I'm mad at some command somewhere and I'm talking to people, but I'm,

2042
02:32:54.96 --> 02:32:59.28
I'm still somebody just called because one of the guys got in trouble. Yeah. Like I always have got

2043
02:32:59.28 --> 02:33:04.32
to put a report off. Yeah, got someone got arrested and so I'll get rid of the live like here we go.

2044
02:33:04.32 --> 02:33:11.76
I got to go to get somebody out of jail, whatever. So, you know, I have to have a new focus.

2045
02:33:11.76 --> 02:33:17.76
And, you know, a new mission. And so my thing was, I, I want to learn about business. I've

2046
02:33:17.76 --> 02:33:26.16
been in government since I was 18, 19. And, you know, I've been in leadership positions and I,

2047
02:33:26.16 --> 02:33:31.36
I think you would agree with you. The leadership's not different. There may be some different

2048
02:33:31.36 --> 02:33:37.12
terms, but it's, it's all the same. But there's other things about business that I didn't really

2049
02:33:37.12 --> 02:33:42.72
understand. Like, what is marketing and what is, you know, social media was a big, you know,

2050
02:33:42.72 --> 02:33:47.28
was starting to be a big thing. And, you know, at that time, we couldn't even have, you know,

2051
02:33:47.28 --> 02:33:51.76
any accounts on social media. And I think, I think it's changed now. I think it's a little bit

2052
02:33:51.76 --> 02:33:57.12
better because it kind of hurts. Guys getting out that don't have that presence because that,

2053
02:33:57.12 --> 02:34:06.000
that's how a lot of businesses is done now on LinkedIn and stuff. So, I felt, I, I need to learn

2054
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:14.48
business. I need to get, get more informed on that. And I still had half of my GI Bill left.

2055
02:34:14.48 --> 02:34:21.28
So, I thought, you know, I could go to grad school, but I, I, I, I, I still want to learn a little

2056
02:34:21.28 --> 02:34:26.40
bit more about how, how it runs first. So, so I, I make sure if I go to grad school for business

2057
02:34:26.40 --> 02:34:35.28
degree, that's really what I want to do. So, I, I, I look for just a way to get into business.

2058
02:34:36.32 --> 02:34:41.36
So, one thing, I had a friend who, a pilot friend that got out kind of the same time, he was

2059
02:34:41.36 --> 02:34:48.48
starting a consulting company. And he asked me about coming on as say, kind of like a 1099 contractor.

2060
02:34:49.04 --> 02:34:54.72
Excuse me. So, I, yeah, that's, that's fine. You know, I'll work with you and we'll do that.

2061
02:34:55.92 --> 02:35:02.08
And as I was doing my, you know, the transition classes, the, what they call it, the call it,

2062
02:35:02.08 --> 02:35:06.88
tap, I didn't do it. Yeah. I didn't do any of it. So, I did tap. I just said later. Yeah, it was,

2063
02:35:06.88 --> 02:35:13.36
it was mostly a, I want, I want to say it's a waste of time. It's because it is, it had some value to

2064
02:35:13.36 --> 02:35:19.60
it, but they had like this entrepreneur class, which was an hour, it was during your lunch hour. So,

2065
02:35:19.60 --> 02:35:23.92
it's that you, you ate your lunch at a table and somebody talked about it. So, he said,

2066
02:35:24.88 --> 02:35:31.28
if you want to start a business, just find something you like and start a business. So, I'm thinking,

2067
02:35:31.28 --> 02:35:35.28
what, what do I like to do? What, what would be fun? I knew I did not want to do government.

2068
02:35:35.28 --> 02:35:42.32
So, I didn't want to work for any of the alphabet, too, but I didn't want to do, you know, stay on,

2069
02:35:42.32 --> 02:35:48.24
any of the commands or, you know, work work as a, as a GS, is wanting to do something totally different

2070
02:35:48.24 --> 02:35:55.20
real business. And I thought, you know, I love music. I've been playing music on my life.

2071
02:35:55.20 --> 02:36:01.04
I'm going to join a band. Somehow we missed this whole story. We were freaking music, did you play?

2072
02:36:01.04 --> 02:36:07.76
I played a, a bright base. Well, actually, when I was, like, team one, I was at, I played saxophone.

2073
02:36:07.76 --> 02:36:12.08
That's where it was. Remember that you played sax? I know we'd bring it on the trip,

2074
02:36:12.08 --> 02:36:16.16
right? You'll tell, how I remember that. Yeah, I forgot about that. And I wrote,

2075
02:36:16.16 --> 02:36:21.28
I wrote, I wrote, I wrote, and I was not that good. I was, I actually, I remember that.

2076
02:36:21.28 --> 02:36:25.84
Yeah, I was, I was not good. And I played, you know, through high school and,

2077
02:36:25.84 --> 02:36:33.12
and, but I was never really good enough to do it. But I always liked the base. It was always

2078
02:36:33.12 --> 02:36:37.68
something that I really enjoyed. Did you play it? Would you just start, oh, so you just liked it?

2079
02:36:37.68 --> 02:36:43.84
Yeah, okay. But I had enough music background that that I could, I could, I could figure out.

2080
02:36:43.84 --> 02:36:48.08
I just bought one, started learning how to play. You say base or you're talking base guitar?

2081
02:36:48.08 --> 02:36:52.96
Are you talking stand up base? No. So I had that time as electric. Okay. Base guitar.

2082
02:36:52.96 --> 02:37:00.32
And, and for some reason, it just, it just came like it was natural.

2083
02:37:00.32 --> 02:37:07.44
Easier than Vietnamese, apparently. Very, very much so. And so I kind of took some private lessons.

2084
02:37:07.44 --> 02:37:13.52
And, and yeah, I just kind of took to it. And then after doing that for a while,

2085
02:37:13.52 --> 02:37:23.20
I, as I was getting out, trying to find bands that the market was was pretty heavy with base

2086
02:37:23.20 --> 02:37:29.44
players. It's, you know, probably a lot of guitar players that don't play that well play base.

2087
02:37:29.44 --> 02:37:34.64
Yeah, and that's true. But that's what they told me. So, you know, I need to find how to

2088
02:37:34.64 --> 02:37:39.20
be how to stand out. So I was like, you know, I'm going to learn how to play up right base. Because

2089
02:37:39.20 --> 02:37:43.76
nobody wants to do it. It's a big instrument. You have to have a car or a truck to have to

2090
02:37:43.76 --> 02:37:50.64
have a van and it's fretless. So, you know, it just scares people. But I'm going to learn it. So,

2091
02:37:50.64 --> 02:37:55.52
I bought one. How much is it? How much is the stand up base cross? Like for your starter model that you get?

2092
02:37:55.52 --> 02:38:01.04
So, I, I knew this is what I wanted to do. So, I didn't really kind of, I kind of started

2093
02:38:01.04 --> 02:38:07.92
with the starter and got a nice kind of pro model, a, uh, angle heart. And, um, so it was about

2094
02:38:07.92 --> 02:38:13.68
2000, around 2000. That's it. Yeah. Dang, bro. And, uh, that's actually, well, way cheaper than I thought

2095
02:38:13.68 --> 02:38:18.80
I was going to be. But, you know, it's a plywood. It's not like a car, you know, 200 year old. I have

2096
02:38:18.80 --> 02:38:24.64
good electric guitars that are way more than that. Yeah. Oh, absolutely more than that.

2097
02:38:24.64 --> 02:38:30.000
That's ridiculous amount of money because I'm stupid. But this, you know, it's a, it's a new one.

2098
02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.88
It's not a classic. But it plays really well. And, uh, so I worked on that. So, when they don't have a

2099
02:38:34.88 --> 02:38:40.96
fret, how do you know where to hold down? So, there are, I do have markers on the side, uh, it's

2100
02:38:40.96 --> 02:38:46.40
like, uh, like the dots that are on a guitar. It's the same. And, uh, but you, you have to listen.

2101
02:38:46.40 --> 02:38:53.60
And, and it really forced me to listen to what the rest of the band is doing and make sure,

2102
02:38:53.60 --> 02:39:00.16
I'm, you know, got the right tone. And, um, yeah, I just, I worked on it. Like, I took six months.

2103
02:39:00.16 --> 02:39:08.08
I've just, how many hours a day? Oh. Two, three hours. I've taken a break and go back to it.

2104
02:39:08.08 --> 02:39:11.76
And, uh, yeah, just worked on it. So, you're mean five to six hours a day?

2105
02:39:11.76 --> 02:39:16.80
Uh, not that much. Probably, yeah, about two or three hours. But you retired every day.

2106
02:39:16.80 --> 02:39:24.64
Yeah. Well, no, I was, I was still kind of, uh, unrap it up your crap and up and, and go in through, uh,

2107
02:39:24.64 --> 02:39:30.32
uh, in terms of relief, three, three to something three or four hours a day. Yeah. And, and then,

2108
02:39:30.32 --> 02:39:36.88
when I felt comfortable, I started looking for, uh, for bands to play in. So I go on, you know,

2109
02:39:36.88 --> 02:39:42.08
whilst would you go, but Craig's listening. Yeah. And, uh, just typed in up right

2110
02:39:42.08 --> 02:39:47.52
base and sure enough, uh, the sky posted that he was doing an acoustic blues thing. And he was

2111
02:39:47.52 --> 02:39:53.52
looking for an upright base and it's like, yeah, there's only one. You got the job. Yeah. Well,

2112
02:39:53.52 --> 02:40:00.72
so I called him up and, uh, our message team or whatever. And he'd said, you know, show up to this

2113
02:40:00.72 --> 02:40:07.44
open mic night. He learned to play in front of a real live audience. And he didn't tell me what

2114
02:40:07.44 --> 02:40:13.76
we were going to play or anything. And, uh, so I showed up and he's like, I, you know, we're playing

2115
02:40:13.76 --> 02:40:20.48
in this key. And I, I was all over the place. I mean, I was, I was nervous. This was, it was my first

2116
02:40:20.48 --> 02:40:24.72
time playing live, but, you know, I was just trying to follow what was going on. Yeah, because you

2117
02:40:24.72 --> 02:40:29.44
played sex live in eighth grade, eighth grade, eighth grade, Freak and Stephen Calsolini.

2118
02:40:32.48 --> 02:40:40.48
It wasn't that bad. But yeah, I played a couple of songs. I was like, yeah, that really sucked.

2119
02:40:40.48 --> 02:40:45.92
And, uh, afterwards he goes, okay, yeah, let's, let's meet next week and, and do another three. I'm

2120
02:40:45.92 --> 02:40:52.16
like, okay. And by that time now, I knew kind of what he was looking for. And, uh, we, we did it.

2121
02:40:52.16 --> 02:40:57.84
And, and then we're like, yeah, let's start a band. I brought in a friend of mine that was a drummer.

2122
02:40:58.48 --> 02:41:07.44
And, uh, eventually a sax player. And we created the band. And, and my intent, again, was not

2123
02:41:07.44 --> 02:41:13.60
really to be a musician. It, or an artist really. And I don't really consider myself an artist.

2124
02:41:13.60 --> 02:41:21.84
I'm artistic, and I can, I understand, you know, how to do it. But I wanted to run the business.

2125
02:41:21.84 --> 02:41:26.64
So I wanted to, you know, manage the books. I wanted to work on the marketing. I wanted to learn

2126
02:41:26.64 --> 02:41:33.28
how the, uh, how the social media worked and how that, you know, worked into getting us gigs.

2127
02:41:34.16 --> 02:41:39.20
And, uh, then we got into recording and writing. And I helped, you know, write, uh, some of the songs.

2128
02:41:39.20 --> 02:41:43.92
And we recorded a couple of albums. So we could sell. Because that was a big thing when you were gigging.

2129
02:41:44.72 --> 02:41:49.52
You know, it's, it's great to get that, that, uh, you know, that money for the night. But if you have

2130
02:41:49.52 --> 02:41:55.36
merch, right? merch. Get the merch out there. Then, you know, we, we saw things go up. And we could show,

2131
02:41:55.92 --> 02:42:00.88
I could show each year, you know, we were making more money. And we were doing, uh, doing better.

2132
02:42:00.88 --> 02:42:07.04
How often are you gigging? So, you know, the first year, probably about 30 or so gig.

2133
02:42:07.04 --> 02:42:12.48
Hey, but by the third year, I mean, we were touring. So I would do a two week. So now you're out of the

2134
02:42:12.48 --> 02:42:18.24
Navy completely. Yeah. And you're going on tour. Yeah. Your blues band and plant stand up base. Yep.

2135
02:42:18.24 --> 02:42:23.04
And, uh, herbidian the danger man is the, uh, are you still, are you still around?

2136
02:42:23.04 --> 02:42:29.12
No. So I'll, I'll get to that in a minute. But the, um, so by the third year, we're playing probably

2137
02:42:29.12 --> 02:42:36.32
180 gigs, making money, making money, yeah. Getting playing how big of a show. Clubs, yeah. I mean,

2138
02:42:36.32 --> 02:42:41.84
we would get a couple of festivals. We would get, uh, you know, mostly bars, you know, that, that kind of

2139
02:42:41.84 --> 02:42:46.56
see. What do you make a night in the bar? Uh, it depends on how much you are, but, you know, four,

2140
02:42:46.56 --> 02:42:53.04
400 bucks, 500 bucks. And how many people are in the band? A four. Yeah. So from a business perspective.

2141
02:42:53.04 --> 02:42:59.44
Yeah. I mean, but we're thinking to try something else. No, no, not at all. So it makes you

2142
02:42:59.44 --> 02:43:07.52
really look at the, the business model. And because all all businesses have, have the same, all

2143
02:43:07.52 --> 02:43:14.000
successful businesses have the same, uh, concept. You got to make it for a dime. You got to sell it for

2144
02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.24
a dollar. You got to make it have it for me. If you don't do that, you're going to go out of business.

2145
02:43:20.24 --> 02:43:26.48
Now, you can supplement it with outs, outside income, but eventually it'll fold. You got to make

2146
02:43:26.48 --> 02:43:31.04
it for a dime, sell it for a dollar and make it have it for you. Did you make that up right there?

2147
02:43:31.04 --> 02:43:37.04
Or no, I learned it when I was, uh, and, and my MBA program. That one's wrong. That was,

2148
02:43:37.04 --> 02:43:42.32
that was basically my MBA and, and those, those three sentences that, that was two years of grad school.

2149
02:43:43.04 --> 02:43:48.64
But, um, but it makes you, especially, and, and, uh, adventure like that, it really makes you look

2150
02:43:48.64 --> 02:43:54.40
at your cost. You know, are you really making it for a dime or are you spending 90 cents?

2151
02:43:54.40 --> 02:44:02.16
And of course, the numbers are arbitrary. But, if, if you're, if you're not, then how do you cut that down?

2152
02:44:02.16 --> 02:44:07.92
So, as we were touring, you know, in the beginning, we were getting hotel rooms. Of course,

2153
02:44:07.92 --> 02:44:13.60
we were all staying in the same room because, you know, there four guys. But, eventually, we're like,

2154
02:44:13.60 --> 02:44:20.64
okay, how can we cut that down? So, we, uh, like, one of the things we got on, uh, couch surfing.

2155
02:44:20.64 --> 02:44:27.52
If you heard of this? Yes, I have. So, we, when I was 19, yeah, exactly. Well, we had a band profile.

2156
02:44:28.48 --> 02:44:35.68
As, uh, uh, for, for couch surfing, and as we were, as I was making the tour, I would say, okay,

2157
02:44:35.68 --> 02:44:41.36
we're going to be in this town. We would submit, you know, hey, this four piece band is coming

2158
02:44:41.36 --> 02:44:46.96
to town. Could we stay at your house and surprisingly, a lot of people, uh, let us do it.

2159
02:44:46.96 --> 02:44:53.60
And it's, it's free. It's free. And, uh, and of course, we would, we would try to do special stuff.

2160
02:44:53.60 --> 02:45:00.000
So, we, of course, get Masey D or T shirt or something. And, uh, and if we were there for

2161
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.04
a day or two, we'd break out the instruments in their living room and just give them a little

2162
02:45:05.04 --> 02:45:10.56
concert. And it was, yeah, it was, it was great. And what was really nice about it

2163
02:45:11.36 --> 02:45:15.76
is because we stayed with them. We told them where we were playing that night. They would usually

2164
02:45:15.76 --> 02:45:20.16
come out and bring some friends. So that would, uh, you know, butts and seats. That's a big part of it.

2165
02:45:21.04 --> 02:45:26.000
So, yeah, make it four-dime. You got to get your cost down. And, uh, and we learned, you know,

2166
02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.84
like, by your water, not at a gas station, by it Walmart before you go because it's cheaper.

2167
02:45:31.84 --> 02:45:36.56
Yeah. And all these little things to get it, uh, the price down. And then you look at,

2168
02:45:36.56 --> 02:45:42.000
are you selling it for a dollar? You know, are you really getting the, the top price? And you

2169
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:47.68
don't set the price. The market sets the price. You know, it's applying demand. And, uh, so that's what,

2170
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:53.52
you know, we're focusing on where can we get the best bang for our buck? You know, if we play at a,

2171
02:45:54.72 --> 02:46:01.76
at a, uh, a festival or something, you know, the focus is on the money you get to play,

2172
02:46:01.76 --> 02:46:08.56
the focus is on the merch. So, having the guys actually push the merch, you know, put the

2173
02:46:08.56 --> 02:46:13.04
CDs in your hand as you go around and talk to people because they see it in your hand, they want to buy it.

2174
02:46:13.04 --> 02:46:17.44
And, you know, just sit back and wait for them to come to you. You got to get out. So, are you,

2175
02:46:17.44 --> 02:46:22.48
you know, making that price? And, is there enough of a profit margin there that the business

2176
02:46:22.48 --> 02:46:27.68
is actually going to, to survive? And then the most important part, as you know, you got to

2177
02:46:27.68 --> 02:46:31.68
make it have it for me. You know, if somebody just watches you wants and I like, hey, that was great.

2178
02:46:32.32 --> 02:46:36.64
And they don't follow you. Then how are you going to sell them, you know, the new album when it

2179
02:46:36.64 --> 02:46:43.76
comes out? Or, you know, you're, you're new, you know, the new song or whatever, you got to get that,

2180
02:46:43.76 --> 02:46:52.32
that fan, you know, down the, the funnel to, to get them from interested to fan to real fanatic

2181
02:46:52.32 --> 02:46:56.40
of, you know, the super fan, or they're going to buy your stuff as soon as it comes out.

2182
02:46:58.48 --> 02:47:04.000
So, that's what I learned during that time, you know, how, how do you actually physically

2183
02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:11.76
do that? And so, we did it for four years and, uh, had, was that your job for four years? Yes. So,

2184
02:47:11.76 --> 02:47:17.68
I was doing a little bit of the consulting on the side and there were other like 1099 type

2185
02:47:17.68 --> 02:47:23.20
jobs that I was doing from here to there. But, you know, again, I was very fortunate that I married

2186
02:47:23.20 --> 02:47:28.96
up. So, my wife was making good money. We don't have any kids. So, you know, I'm not putting

2187
02:47:28.96 --> 02:47:36.40
anyone through college and I have a good retirement. So, I was able to do that full time.

2188
02:47:36.40 --> 02:47:41.52
It's what happened. So, have the end. Well, it's like any business, you know, you, you have that

2189
02:47:41.52 --> 02:47:47.44
arc and there comes a point where you got to pivot our parish and we have been playing kind of the

2190
02:47:47.44 --> 02:47:54.32
same material for how many albums did you make? Two. Well, one EP, one LP. And I watched a couple

2191
02:47:54.32 --> 02:47:59.52
of your songs on YouTube. Yeah. I thought it was pretty cool. Like a Tarist. I think this was like a

2192
02:47:59.52 --> 02:48:03.76
thing, right? You had that, there's a song where he's playing a guitar that only has three strings.

2193
02:48:03.76 --> 02:48:08.96
Yeah. GGB. So, we call it. Yeah. That was pretty cool. And you think, okay, well, he's got some,

2194
02:48:08.96 --> 02:48:13.04
like the white stripes. He's got some constraints around what he can do and it's going to make him kind

2195
02:48:13.04 --> 02:48:17.68
of push a little bit. I thought that was pretty cool. It is. And that was, you know, kind of the,

2196
02:48:17.68 --> 02:48:22.88
you got to break away from the homininshrum and, you know, the normal stuff. You got to keep

2197
02:48:22.88 --> 02:48:28.08
updating, especially in the entertainment world because there's so much competing with your attention.

2198
02:48:28.64 --> 02:48:38.000
And so after about four years, we needed to kind of change some things. But the, the lead guy was,

2199
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.80
you know, he was kind of comfortable where he was and we could have kind of gone, you know,

2200
02:48:42.80 --> 02:48:48.96
a little bit further. But the, but the sax player wanted to do some other stuff. So he, he left.

2201
02:48:48.96 --> 02:48:54.80
And we tried to bring in some other people and then I was like, you know, this is the time to

2202
02:48:54.80 --> 02:48:59.92
make a difference. We got to totally change because we tried to keep doing the same thing.

2203
02:48:59.92 --> 02:49:04.64
We're going to start losing people. And that's what happened. We didn't really change enough

2204
02:49:04.64 --> 02:49:11.84
drastically that we started to lose fans. And by that point, you know, I've been out of the

2205
02:49:11.84 --> 02:49:19.28
Navy been retired for about five years, four, yeah, about four years. And I had enough of a grasp of,

2206
02:49:19.28 --> 02:49:24.88
okay, this is the things I need to work on that I was like, okay, I'm going back to grad school.

2207
02:49:24.88 --> 02:49:31.52
So, um, the, I still played a little bit on the side. We did some some duo stuff. But now I was,

2208
02:49:31.52 --> 02:49:37.20
I was focused on going back to grad school for my MBA. And that's why I did. And how was that program?

2209
02:49:37.20 --> 02:49:43.28
It was good. I did it at the ultimate university there. Because it was close, you know, it was

2210
02:49:43.84 --> 02:49:52.72
easy to get back. A lot of people in that area went to Odeeew. So, you know, we had planned to stay there

2211
02:49:52.72 --> 02:50:01.28
for the long term. So it made sense. And, you know, the GI Bill covered it. So, you know, the cost was low.

2212
02:50:01.28 --> 02:50:09.28
I was a dime. And the return was hopefully a dollar. And it was good. So, it, yeah.

2213
02:50:09.28 --> 02:50:17.04
Did you do anything with that degree? So, yes. So, I, once I got, I actually, while I was in school,

2214
02:50:17.92 --> 02:50:26.32
I had talked to a couple of business owners that needed someone to help do kind of do diligence on some,

2215
02:50:26.32 --> 02:50:32.80
some business stuff. So, it was small companies that were expanding and looking to do some different things.

2216
02:50:33.44 --> 02:50:42.16
And I actually still were formed today. But they would, so I would, you know, do like the, the analysis on it.

2217
02:50:42.16 --> 02:50:47.44
You know, is this the right thing to do? They're a developer. So, they would buy property.

2218
02:50:48.24 --> 02:50:53.76
And then they would say, okay, what business can we put on here to make money and then we'll turn it over.

2219
02:50:53.76 --> 02:50:58.56
So, I would do kind of the analysis of, you know, we do this. You, and you take out a loan.

2220
02:50:58.96 --> 02:51:03.28
Here's all your initial costs. If you can keep your, you know, fixed variable cost, all that.

2221
02:51:03.28 --> 02:51:08.000
Then you can make a profit over a certain period of years. And then they would say, okay, let's, let's do it.

2222
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:12.08
So, so yeah, more of a kind of a business analysis.

2223
02:51:16.16 --> 02:51:21.84
Yeah, kind of, kind of work. And it's, it's, it's good work. And when you actually see something,

2224
02:51:21.84 --> 02:51:30.16
one of the projects we did and it made great money. And so I got to see all that developed.

2225
02:51:30.16 --> 02:51:35.12
And, and so yeah, it was, it was really interesting, especially to be able to,

2226
02:51:35.76 --> 02:51:40.24
kind of say, this is what I think is happening. And then you look at how close it actually did.

2227
02:51:40.24 --> 02:51:44.80
It's not perfect. But it was good. It was a really, it's a good thing.

2228
02:51:44.80 --> 02:51:52.96
And is that bringing us up to present day? Yeah. So, well, so when I was in, in grad school, my wife got

2229
02:51:54.40 --> 02:52:02.88
diagnosed with breast cancer. And yeah, that was, it was good being out of the military.

2230
02:52:02.88 --> 02:52:07.28
Although, you know, the teams were great about that stuff. But because I was home every day,

2231
02:52:07.28 --> 02:52:14.88
it was good that I could, I could be there and kind of work because it took like two years to go through it.

2232
02:52:14.88 --> 02:52:22.88
From time she was diagnosed, she had three or four surgeries, then the chemo. And then the

2233
02:52:24.64 --> 02:52:30.80
recovery from all that. Took about, took about two years. And so I was home for all that.

2234
02:52:30.80 --> 02:52:35.28
I was still going to school. But I could, I could manage it because, you know, most of the stuff was,

2235
02:52:35.28 --> 02:52:48.96
was at home. And so she went through that. And when we kind of got through that, it was,

2236
02:52:48.96 --> 02:52:55.52
and still in the recovery stage, we kind of got into a rut of, because she just didn't have any

2237
02:52:55.52 --> 02:53:02.96
energy. So we're staying at home all the time, watching TV, just, you know, eating three meals a day or

2238
02:53:02.96 --> 02:53:08.96
whatever. And just was a lot of activity. And at one point I was like, you know, we need to break this cycle.

2239
02:53:09.60 --> 02:53:17.44
And so we bought a small 16-foot camper. And I was like, we're, you know, we talked about this.

2240
02:53:17.44 --> 02:53:22.32
We, we need to at least once a month, just get out of the house. We didn't have a TV in it.

2241
02:53:22.32 --> 02:53:28.24
It was, you know, just just a nice, it was an air stream, a base camp. I don't know.

2242
02:53:28.24 --> 02:53:34.64
And we're like, we just need to get out of the house at least once a month. And just kind of get back.

2243
02:53:34.64 --> 02:53:40.64
Even if we just walk around a little bit, or, and there was a campground right there in Virginia.

2244
02:53:41.12 --> 02:53:47.76
So we did that for about two years as she was recovering, just going out, just getting into

2245
02:53:47.76 --> 02:53:54.48
nature and just, you know, trying to get past that. And after doing that for two years,

2246
02:53:54.48 --> 02:54:00.08
we were like, why aren't we doing this all the time? So we decided that,

2247
02:54:01.84 --> 02:54:07.12
about this was about 15 months ago, we said, hey, let's just, let's just sell our house and get

2248
02:54:07.12 --> 02:54:12.32
rid of all the extra cars and extra furniture and stuff. We have laying around, let's get, we'll

2249
02:54:12.32 --> 02:54:17.44
get a bigger camper because 16 feet is not that small enough to live. How big is your new one?

2250
02:54:17.44 --> 02:54:21.84
30. We have a 30-foot air stream. Yeah. And so we traded that in.

2251
02:54:21.84 --> 02:54:29.52
And got the 30-foot sold our place. It was a good time for the market. And so yeah, for the past

2252
02:54:29.52 --> 02:54:37.12
15 months, we've just been touring around North America. Just going from place to place,

2253
02:54:37.68 --> 02:54:43.52
trying to hit a lot of the national parks in America. It's just such a beautiful place and,

2254
02:54:44.88 --> 02:54:50.64
growing up in the Navy, we traveled all over the place. But never really got to see a lot of the

2255
02:54:50.64 --> 02:54:55.20
US, even non-training trips. You know, really get to see much. So yeah, that's what we've been doing

2256
02:54:55.20 --> 02:55:04.48
for past 50 months. I still, she retired totally after her chemo. She lost a lot of that drive.

2257
02:55:04.48 --> 02:55:11.52
So we just saw, you know, why don't you take some time off? And I still do part-time work.

2258
02:55:11.52 --> 02:55:17.12
It's all remote. It's a semi-emails when they need stuff. Do sometimes I take a business trip

2259
02:55:17.12 --> 02:55:22.32
and we're, you know, I'll fly someplace and come back. But yeah, we just been doing that and

2260
02:55:23.04 --> 02:55:29.92
seeing people like, you know, opportunity to be here and see you's one of the big benefits.

2261
02:55:30.72 --> 02:55:35.68
And as you see in the end in sight, no, not right now. Just going to keep rolling. Just keep doing

2262
02:55:35.68 --> 02:55:42.40
it. Every place we go, we say, hey, what, you know, would we come back here to live? And,

2263
02:55:42.40 --> 02:55:48.32
you know, if we, there's some, some places we really like, but what's the top of the list right now?

2264
02:55:49.04 --> 02:55:55.84
We really like Denver, Colorado. They have a really good blue scene. So I have my, a bright base with me.

2265
02:55:55.84 --> 02:56:01.36
Takes a path of recon vehicle. It does take up a lot. But I have like my little space

2266
02:56:01.36 --> 02:56:08.40
sober by the bed. I can keep anything I want. That's my music room. And, but we, yeah, when we go to

2267
02:56:08.40 --> 02:56:14.72
these places, I look up blue stamps and show up and, and get to play with some phenomenal people.

2268
02:56:14.72 --> 02:56:21.76
And, uh, yeah, it's, it's just part of the, just traveling around, meeting people and seeing

2269
02:56:21.76 --> 02:56:28.96
really a friends and family. I, I got to see some family in Texas that, some on her side that she'd never,

2270
02:56:28.96 --> 02:56:34.96
or I'd never met before. And, I, we'd been married over 30 years. Friends team, you know,

2271
02:56:34.96 --> 02:56:40.40
guys from the team that now live in all kinds of places. And, you know, we stay connected and say,

2272
02:56:40.40 --> 02:56:44.40
I'm going to be in from this time. If you got time, I'd love to see if not, you know, I understand.

2273
02:56:45.12 --> 02:56:49.76
And, uh, so it's, yeah, it's been awesome. For an awesome, and you're tracking this whole thing on the

2274
02:56:49.76 --> 02:56:57.20
gram on Instagram. Yeah, my, my wife runs most of that. It's, uh, taking leave under score RV.

2275
02:56:57.92 --> 02:57:01.28
And she, you know, post every day because, you know, how important you got it.

2276
02:57:01.28 --> 02:57:07.60
For social media, you, you got to be consistent. Are you playing any based riffs on your Instagram?

2277
02:57:07.60 --> 02:57:12.000
Yeah. So I think the people are going to hear that. Yeah. She, uh, she records it live and then,

2278
02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.64
you know, post it later. But yeah, when we go to these jams, I, I'm, I'm up there playing. So,

2279
02:57:16.64 --> 02:57:23.04
sure. It's, uh, well, that's outstanding. Hi, hey, probably a good place to wrap it up. Echo Charles.

2280
02:57:23.04 --> 02:57:27.52
Yes, sir. Do you have any questions? Yes, all right. So you ran. Go back to high school.

2281
02:57:27.52 --> 02:57:32.64
Or yeah. All right. You did do cross country. Have you been saying a question for free

2282
02:57:32.64 --> 02:57:38.16
in two and hours and 45 minutes? That's correct. You know, my school didn't have cross country. I

2283
02:57:38.16 --> 02:57:46.40
think some of the other districts did, uh, but my, my school was very, time somewhat, in an urban area.

2284
02:57:46.40 --> 02:57:53.84
So we had track. And most, most of the guys were, were springers. So, uh, the, uh, so we, we didn't

2285
02:57:53.84 --> 02:58:00.08
have cross country, but we had long distance on the track, which is, you know, going eight circles.

2286
02:58:00.80 --> 02:58:05.36
What cross country would have been your jam? Yeah. I would have loved to do it. And, of course,

2287
02:58:05.36 --> 02:58:12.000
I ran a lot outside of, uh, just track, but, uh, but, yeah, like today, uh,

2288
02:58:13.04 --> 02:58:19.44
another thing I try to do as we, as we travel, I, I look for great runs, you know, running,

2289
02:58:19.44 --> 02:58:26.000
running places. And I've been kicking around a, uh, a YouTube video because I carry a camera with me.

2290
02:58:26.72 --> 02:58:33.04
And I kind of film little parts of the run. And then when I get back, I, uh, of course, upload

2291
02:58:33.04 --> 02:58:39.36
all that and then put together these four to five minute videos of, you know, this is all, kind of the

2292
02:58:39.36 --> 02:58:44.16
data of the run. You know, this is how far it is. This is the elevation. You know, there's a lot of

2293
02:58:44.16 --> 02:58:50.24
hills as it's straight. We're kind of a turf is it? Um, you know, where do you park? You know, here's the

2294
02:58:50.24 --> 02:58:55.12
address you want to use to get to a parking areas or support. You know, is there going to be a bathroom

2295
02:58:55.12 --> 02:59:04.32
there or, or what? And, uh, so I've gotten about 30 runs done with, with, with the raw material,

2296
02:59:04.32 --> 02:59:10.16
I just started kind of putting them together. I've got four completed and I've got my process down

2297
02:59:10.16 --> 02:59:16.88
to about four hours. So the first one took about a couple of days because I, you had to figure out

2298
02:59:16.88 --> 02:59:23.28
the format. It's like that goes, pace on making it. So now, yeah, I can get five six minute video

2299
02:59:23.28 --> 02:59:29.36
done and about four to five hours. So, you know, again, it's, make it four dime, sell it four dollar.

2300
02:59:29.36 --> 02:59:34.32
You know, if it takes me a couple of weeks to do one video, it's, because you got to be consistent,

2301
02:59:34.32 --> 02:59:41.28
as you know, you got to post consistently to get a good following. Would you say that you're, uh,

2302
02:59:41.28 --> 02:59:45.68
as far as what you'd prefer as far as runs go, do you prefer the two mile, one mile or eight,

2303
02:59:45.68 --> 02:59:50.64
eight, or eight hundred meter. Yeah, so the half mile is not a decent run. I don't know.

2304
02:59:50.64 --> 02:59:55.28
That's a sprint. Yeah. I mean, the guys that are doing it are our sprinting. And,

2305
02:59:55.84 --> 03:00:01.68
I don't know why it was like this, but I remember the track meets like the first run was the two mile.

2306
03:00:01.68 --> 03:00:07.60
Then it was the one mile. Then the last one was an eight eight. So I've already run two races

2307
03:00:07.60 --> 03:00:13.44
and I'm, I'm more out. And now you've got to sprint the eight eight. So I like the distance running.

2308
03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:20.16
And the runs I do now are anywhere from five to 12 miles. What's your fastest mile?

2309
03:00:21.68 --> 03:00:28.96
Back in the day. So when I was running, uh, back in the day, when I was running marathons,

2310
03:00:28.96 --> 03:00:38.16
then I could get down to a good, um, round seven minutes, seven, low over seven minutes.

2311
03:00:38.16 --> 03:00:42.80
In for a marathon. For, yeah, for a for a marathon. What about like when you were competing

2312
03:00:42.80 --> 03:00:49.52
in track or whatever? Yeah, that got down. I think about a six and a half somewhere around there,

2313
03:00:49.52 --> 03:00:55.60
but I'm not doing that now. Now it's, I'm more long for the ride. I'm trying to like,

2314
03:00:55.60 --> 03:01:00.16
I want to look at the things and yeah, say talking about YouTube, what one last thing I want to talk

2315
03:01:00.16 --> 03:01:04.56
about or just at least explain, uh, you made a really cool video about your grandfather. Yes.

2316
03:01:04.56 --> 03:01:09.68
That was a pretty cool that people might want to check out. Yeah, I, you know, I attribute that to,

2317
03:01:09.68 --> 03:01:14.16
uh, really to you, Jaco, it, you know, listen as podcasts when my favorite things when you have

2318
03:01:15.60 --> 03:01:22.32
guys from, you know, World War II, Korea, the, you know, the Vietnam and just the stories that they

2319
03:01:22.32 --> 03:01:31.20
telling everybody's got a story. And, uh, when I, when I, when I, here that, I remember my, my

2320
03:01:31.20 --> 03:01:41.84
grandfather actually both of them, both served in, in World War II. And, but my, my one grandfather

2321
03:01:42.40 --> 03:01:48.72
was, was just a very introverted and he was in the army. He was in the, the mechanized in tanks.

2322
03:01:48.72 --> 03:02:00.88
And, uh, he went over as a replacement for, uh, for the, uh, was the 81st tank battalion. And, uh,

2323
03:02:01.92 --> 03:02:07.84
but he never talked about it. When, when I was growing up, I would spend summers working on the farm

2324
03:02:07.84 --> 03:02:13.20
with him. And, uh, he never mentioned it. And, at that time, you know, I didn't know what it has for,

2325
03:02:13.20 --> 03:02:19.76
you know, you know, tell me about the war. And, uh, but he, beating every, but he, it wasn't like it's

2326
03:02:19.76 --> 03:02:25.36
just me. He never talked about with his kids or, you know, his family. It was just a part of his life

2327
03:02:25.36 --> 03:02:32.64
that was kind of in the past. And, and, uh, just never talked about it. So, and he passed away, uh, in the,

2328
03:02:32.64 --> 03:02:40.64
in the early 90s. When a couple of, about a year or so ago, my aunt brought me his,

2329
03:02:40.64 --> 03:02:48.80
like his old photo albums from that, that time. And it also had all of his military paperwork

2330
03:02:48.80 --> 03:02:54.24
in a twitch, you know, you think of our field jackets, or pretty thick. Back then, it was like a

2331
03:02:54.24 --> 03:02:58.88
page or two. I mean, there, there wasn't, wasn't much at all. Like go to war, cool your home.

2332
03:02:58.88 --> 03:03:06.72
Yeah. Exactly. And, you know, so, because of my, my time, I was able to look at these and,

2333
03:03:06.72 --> 03:03:12.24
and kind of understand, all right. So, he was at this unit at this time, and he was actually in

2334
03:03:12.24 --> 03:03:19.28
the fourth calf back when they had horses. Damn. So, you know, to think about that, that time of

2335
03:03:19.28 --> 03:03:26.80
when your main asset was a horse. I, you know, this, this, this, Enlil that has its own personality.

2336
03:03:26.80 --> 03:03:33.36
And, you know, you think of what we drive today. And, uh, but, but that, you know, that's, that's part of

2337
03:03:33.36 --> 03:03:39.60
your main thing. So, uh, so I was able to come up with a timeline of where he was, what units,

2338
03:03:39.60 --> 03:03:46.24
he was in. Then I spent some time just reading books on it. So, finding books about that unit

2339
03:03:46.24 --> 03:03:51.12
overall, reading it, reading about that time, reading about the, the operations to kind of get

2340
03:03:51.12 --> 03:03:57.52
a better idea of what he did, or what he may have done, because I, I don't know for sure, I never,

2341
03:03:57.52 --> 03:04:02.96
he never told me. But I was able, especially on the internet, I was able to find some after action,

2342
03:04:02.96 --> 03:04:09.60
like, they're monthly reporting from that unit when he was, uh, when he was over in,

2343
03:04:10.72 --> 03:04:16.96
in Germany as they were pushing to the Rhine. And, uh, and of course, I've written plenty of

2344
03:04:16.96 --> 03:04:22.24
after action reports. You can kind of read between the lines sometimes, but it had great data.

2345
03:04:22.64 --> 03:04:27.84
And I was able to kind of take all of his pictures that he had in his albums,

2346
03:04:27.84 --> 03:04:35.20
digitize them, and then go kind of walk through the store using all these external sources

2347
03:04:35.68 --> 03:04:40.24
and say, okay, this is, you know, where he would have been during this time. This is what happened

2348
03:04:40.24 --> 03:04:48.16
near in that time. So, he was probably on this, uh, this cavalry march, or he was probably in the

2349
03:04:48.16 --> 03:04:54.24
tanks when they got hit on it. So, I kind of found the, the one day that he probably was in combat

2350
03:04:54.24 --> 03:04:58.96
for the first time, you know, where they first took casualties. And again, I don't know for sure,

2351
03:04:58.96 --> 03:05:06.16
but, uh, but I was able to kind of create a timeline. So, I create a video of all of his pictures.

2352
03:05:06.16 --> 03:05:13.52
So, when I'm doing the voiceover, and I'm telling the stories, there's showing pictures of

2353
03:05:13.52 --> 03:05:18.48
kind of that period of time, and so you kind of get an idea. And I, and I totally just did it for my

2354
03:05:18.48 --> 03:05:26.96
family because they didn't have really any stories from him. And, uh, yeah, I set kind of a deadline

2355
03:05:26.96 --> 03:05:31.84
to have it by veterans day. I missed it by a little bit, but I wanted to do it before the holidays.

2356
03:05:31.84 --> 03:05:36.56
So, when they were with their kids, they could watch it with them, and kind of understand who their

2357
03:05:36.56 --> 03:05:41.84
grandfather was and where he came from. And, uh, so, yeah, that's, uh, that's what you saw.

2358
03:05:41.84 --> 03:05:46.96
What's the YouTube channel that that's on? So, it's on my personal channel, but his name is

2359
03:05:46.96 --> 03:05:57.20
Everett Wees. I think the name of the, uh, the, the, the video is, you know, corporal Everett Wees.

2360
03:05:57.20 --> 03:06:02.96
So, if you spell Wees, W, I, W, E, I, W, E, I, SS, W, I, E, S, E.

2361
03:06:02.96 --> 03:06:09.76
Oh, okay, so it's, it's charming. But, it's, uh, completely W, I, yes, and yeah, Everett Wees, um, yeah, W, I,

2362
03:06:09.76 --> 03:06:14.96
E, S, E. But, uh, yeah, I mean, uh, one of our mutual friends sent that to me and told me to check it out.

2363
03:06:14.96 --> 03:06:20.56
It's very cool. Um, awesome stuff. If there's one thing that could say that I've found

2364
03:06:21.76 --> 03:06:28.88
that I don't like about this, is, or the no mad lifestyle, the no mad, yeah, is the van,

2365
03:06:28.88 --> 03:06:34.48
vagabond. Um, it's, it's, because you're traveling around so much, you're moving, you know, we

2366
03:06:34.48 --> 03:06:42.000
move every, uh, two weeks to a month. You really lose that kind of connection to a community.

2367
03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:50.32
And, uh, for example, like for, two, just two, for the, before we did this, I was training,

2368
03:06:50.32 --> 03:06:56.32
I'll be at, I was, you know, white belt, no striped. But, uh, and if I could, I give a shout out to

2369
03:06:56.32 --> 03:07:02.16
coastal BJJ, they're in Virginia Beach, phenomenal. Jim, they, they were awesome, you know,

2370
03:07:02.16 --> 03:07:08.56
guide, white hair coming in at 50, they, they, uh, they, they took really, really good care of me,

2371
03:07:08.56 --> 03:07:14.72
Nester and the guys down there just, just awesome guys. And, um, so I was, I was training with them

2372
03:07:14.72 --> 03:07:21.28
and, and it was, it was that, that community, but by doing this, you got to leave that.

2373
03:07:21.28 --> 03:07:24.64
And I, and I, and I talked to him before I left us, like, you know, what do you think it,

2374
03:07:24.64 --> 03:07:31.12
you know, can I just go to another gym and, and, and he said yes, but what I found, especially with

2375
03:07:31.12 --> 03:07:39.52
COVID, it's tough to kind of show up for just a couple of weeks and, you know, nobody knows where

2376
03:07:39.52 --> 03:07:44.24
you've been and, you know, I think the light gyms is just like this, because it's such close contact,

2377
03:07:44.24 --> 03:07:52.48
that, you know, they kind of stay in their own. And, uh, and it's, it's tough to, uh, to kind of be part of

2378
03:07:52.48 --> 03:07:59.12
that community. And, uh, I think we're going to change that as, as we go through this lifestyle.

2379
03:07:59.12 --> 03:08:05.60
We're finding that, uh, the first year and a half, we've been jumping around so much,

2380
03:08:06.56 --> 03:08:11.44
that we kind of need to home base a little bit more. So we have a property down in Florida.

2381
03:08:12.08 --> 03:08:16.48
And, uh, so our plan is for the winners. We'll, we'll probably be there.

2382
03:08:17.28 --> 03:08:24.24
And spend about five, six months there, and then be kind of part of that community. And then,

2383
03:08:24.24 --> 03:08:27.92
for the summer, pick a place, like, uh, I think this year, we're going to go all the way up to

2384
03:08:27.92 --> 03:08:32.56
Maine. Oh, so we're going to hit, uh, those areas. And then maybe the next year, go out, maybe

2385
03:08:32.56 --> 03:08:37.04
back out to the West Coast, like we did this year, just wearing Maine to see people farming to Maine.

2386
03:08:37.44 --> 03:08:42.32
Go up to the origin factory. You know, the deal. You get people to train jiu-jitsu with,

2387
03:08:42.32 --> 03:08:46.72
come to the camp. We have camp in August. Okay. It's freaking awesome. Actually, I might be there.

2388
03:08:46.72 --> 03:08:51.92
Yeah, they're in that tom on up, man. It's, it's, it's awesome. I mean, it's so cool.

2389
03:08:51.92 --> 03:08:58.72
There's several hundred people there from all over the world to train jiu-jitsu hang out.

2390
03:08:58.72 --> 03:09:03.36
It's, it's great. Yeah. Again, I'm, I'm white belt. There's all kinds of white belts there.

2391
03:09:03.36 --> 03:09:08.000
Okay. No factor. No factor at all. Come and get it. All right. That'd be freaking legit.

2392
03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:13.60
I'll look for those dates. Right. Any other closing thoughts, man? Yeah, thanks to my wife that

2393
03:09:13.60 --> 03:09:23.04
supports all of this, this, this crazy thing that we do and she's just, I mean, she's my best friend.

2394
03:09:23.04 --> 03:09:28.96
And we've been married, coming up on 31 years and just no one else that I want to do that

2395
03:09:29.76 --> 03:09:35.04
do this with. So, really appreciate her. Right, oh, man. Well, thanks for coming all

2396
03:09:35.04 --> 03:09:41.20
man. Thanks for, thanks for sharing your stories, thanks for sharing your lessons. Thanks for your service

2397
03:09:41.20 --> 03:09:47.36
to the country, to the Navy, to the teams. And thanks for being someone I'll always be able to call

2398
03:09:47.36 --> 03:09:55.68
friend, man. Appreciate it. Thank you. All right. So Chris, he's gone. He stepped out.

2399
03:09:57.28 --> 03:10:03.68
You, you may have heard people say there's no standard day in the seal teams. That's absolutely true.

2400
03:10:03.68 --> 03:10:08.16
You don't have, hey, this is just a normal day. But what I think this highlights is,

2401
03:10:08.16 --> 03:10:13.36
there's just no kind of standard career. There's so many different directions things can go

2402
03:10:14.08 --> 03:10:19.60
that you're just going to have a different experience. And what's cool is you can have some control over

2403
03:10:19.60 --> 03:10:25.68
that experience. You have, you get, you have the capability of adjusting. I mean, you look at

2404
03:10:26.56 --> 03:10:32.40
Giff and I, very, you know, came in at the same time. We're in the same buzz class. We kind of like the same

2405
03:10:32.40 --> 03:10:39.12
same, we're on the same path. And yet, you know, he's speaking Vietnamese. We, I'm, we both became

2406
03:10:39.12 --> 03:10:44.96
radiomen. But he's speaking Vietnamese. Just all these different things happen. He ends up like doing the

2407
03:10:45.52 --> 03:10:51.84
advanced special operation stuff. Just, it's just different things happen. And you just get different

2408
03:10:51.84 --> 03:11:01.68
experiences. So it's that to me is a benefit to joining the military is, and I can only really

2409
03:11:01.68 --> 03:11:08.40
say this with 100% certainty about the seal teams because that's where I spent my time. But most of

2410
03:11:08.40 --> 03:11:13.44
the military, everyone I talked with the same thing. You have, it's like a choose your own adventure book.

2411
03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:20.32
The chances that somebody else chooses the same adventure as you is very small. So awesome to talk

2412
03:11:20.32 --> 03:11:27.92
to Chris and, and here, and here is, because because he's a friend of the other that's crazy

2413
03:11:27.92 --> 03:11:33.20
to think about the seal teams. Like your friends come and go and you may not see a guy for like,

2414
03:11:33.20 --> 03:11:41.04
when I saw him downstairs, I don't think I seen him for probably 15 years, 15 years. We, we, and we,

2415
03:11:41.04 --> 03:11:45.44
he hit me up, got his my number, whatever. And he's like, hey, hey, Joc, I'm in town. I'm like,

2416
03:11:45.44 --> 03:11:48.08
oh, cool, you want to come hang out, you want to be on the podcast? Because, oh, yeah,

2417
03:11:48.08 --> 03:11:52.32
I'll be awesome. I listen to it all the time. So just, but no, no like, well, how of you, but no,

2418
03:11:52.32 --> 03:11:57.04
because it's a shared, you have this shared common background. And then with that shared,

2419
03:11:57.04 --> 03:12:02.40
come and background, your friends, you're like, cool, I have friends I don't talk to. If I saw him

2420
03:12:02.40 --> 03:12:07.04
tomorrow, be like, hey, you know, no factors, like no factor. That's the only,

2421
03:12:08.88 --> 03:12:14.80
may I, there's no, hey, you didn't call me. No one expects you to call me. Don't expect me to call

2422
03:12:14.80 --> 03:12:18.80
you. I'm not calling you. You're not going to call me cool. But if you need something call me,

2423
03:12:18.80 --> 03:12:22.08
call me, you don't have to call me. You don't have to prep call me. You don't have to keep,

2424
03:12:22.08 --> 03:12:27.76
you have to send me birthday cards, whatever. You need me cool. I'll show up or you want to,

2425
03:12:27.76 --> 03:12:34.24
you got your in town? Give me a shout. We'll go roll. We'll see what's up. You, it does go to show

2426
03:12:34.24 --> 03:12:38.40
to how like, it's almost like you put into perspective where you have people with such different

2427
03:12:38.40 --> 03:12:45.12
backgrounds. And then they kind of converge on this maybe seal journey. They get washed up and

2428
03:12:45.12 --> 03:12:48.96
filtered out and then they get kind of spit out into their, you know, common interest for sure

2429
03:12:48.96 --> 03:12:53.84
and common goals. But in such different ways, like if you talk to, you know, you say like,

2430
03:12:53.84 --> 03:12:58.72
maybe seals don't have a stereotype where they, you think they have a stereotype. They do what they

2431
03:12:58.72 --> 03:13:02.72
don't. But they don't. Yeah. This is like a really good example because I'm, you know, I'm talking

2432
03:13:02.72 --> 03:13:08.48
on me. It's like a super nice kind of introverted person and then now talk to you. You're like,

2433
03:13:08.48 --> 03:13:14.72
no way that they were like compods and the team. Like it doesn't make sense. And have the exact

2434
03:13:14.72 --> 03:13:21.44
same job, hung out and did stuff together. And then so like I'm trying to imagine, you know,

2435
03:13:21.44 --> 03:13:25.52
like every time everyone talks like when they tell their story, I always try to kind of put

2436
03:13:25.52 --> 03:13:29.04
myself like, I want to know how they were, you know, like what they looked like. I see them in front of

2437
03:13:29.04 --> 03:13:33.84
me now. But what did they look like? They young version. You know, you look exactly like that.

2438
03:13:33.84 --> 03:13:40.64
He looked exactly the same. Just darker hair probably. He had darker hair, but he looked the same.

2439
03:13:40.64 --> 03:13:46.40
You know, there's almost the same build. I mean, I, I'm bigger than I was like when we went through

2440
03:13:46.40 --> 03:13:53.20
buds, when we started buds, I was 174, you know, I'm 230 right now. He probably weighs somewhere in

2441
03:13:53.20 --> 03:13:58.000
the neighborhood. Well, I don't know what he weighed in buds, but he looks about the same. You know,

2442
03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:03.68
and I'm sure does he have a couple more wrinkles? Whatever we all do. But looks about the same.

2443
03:14:03.68 --> 03:14:08.72
Yeah. So you imagine him like just functioning, you know, I kind of imagine him yelling at

2444
03:14:08.72 --> 03:14:13.60
nobody. To me, he's just like the super friendly person. But I'm sure he was like,

2445
03:14:13.60 --> 03:14:18.40
getting after the way everyone else was weird. That contrast is real weird. Yeah. It's fun. Interesting.

2446
03:14:18.40 --> 03:14:25.52
It is good stuff, man. Good stuff. Oh, it's always good to talk to your old friends and see

2447
03:14:25.52 --> 03:14:29.84
where they're at, see what they're up to. And maybe there's a chance they're playing stand-up

2448
03:14:29.84 --> 03:14:36.96
base in a blues band. Well, but every, the actual, I'll say, it's in a second. What I did kind of

2449
03:14:36.96 --> 03:14:42.72
what did hit me at one point. You know, when you're talking about, um, when someone, when you're

2450
03:14:42.72 --> 03:14:48.32
superior, this was like, if you're really hardcore, you're gonna go, what with no, no, ground pad.

2451
03:14:48.32 --> 03:14:52.16
Whatever. All you're gonna bring is a poncho and a poncho on there. Yeah. So, and you just

2452
03:14:52.16 --> 03:14:59.12
finished it by, sever. Well, or was it? Or what? Yeah. In a way, it was like, it was, it fulfilled itself,

2453
03:14:59.12 --> 03:15:04.08
right, as a thing. But no ground pad is a problem. By the way, after that, like I never go in the

2454
03:15:04.08 --> 03:15:09.60
field without a ground pad, I never go in the field without a, a, a roll, beanie. And I did have a

2455
03:15:09.60 --> 03:15:14.96
roll, beanie, but that saved me. And I never go in the field without my, Gore-Tex jacket.

2456
03:15:14.96 --> 03:15:19.12
Because, in worst case, now you put on a Gore-Tex jacket, a beanie, man, in a ground pad,

2457
03:15:19.12 --> 03:15:23.52
you're gonna be able to, like, last a lot longer with a lot more comfort. If you don't have

2458
03:15:23.52 --> 03:15:28.80
those things, you're screwed. So you learn your lesson. Lesson was learned. It was, it was it,

2459
03:15:28.80 --> 03:15:35.60
that experience. That, that made you, ground pad. 100%. Okay. So, to me, was funny. I mean, good.

2460
03:15:35.60 --> 03:15:40.80
Then that's good for sure. But what struck me the most, what stood out is like, you know who you're

2461
03:15:40.80 --> 03:15:47.20
like, you're watched back to the future? Yeah. I mean, I know the movie, but I can't say,

2462
03:15:47.20 --> 03:15:53.92
I know the plot. So, because I'm not a freaking doorker. So, Marty McFly, right? The main guy,

2463
03:15:53.92 --> 03:15:59.52
Michael J. Fawler. Yeah. His weakness was if you call him chicken, he'll do the dumbest stuff.

2464
03:15:59.52 --> 03:16:03.52
Oh, you got to do his column chicken. And that's like a theme throughout all the, you know,

2465
03:16:03.52 --> 03:16:08.32
that in fact, like later on, that's like why he like ruined the story. Questions might be in

2466
03:16:08.32 --> 03:16:13.28
hardcore. You're the exact same. You're Marty McFly. But instead of kicking it's, uh,

2467
03:16:13.28 --> 03:16:18.08
freaking hardcore. Yeah. Well, not hardcore. Sorry. Yeah. I would say, especially when I was,

2468
03:16:18.08 --> 03:16:25.36
well, you're still like that. You still like that. True. If, in fact, now you're smarter than

2469
03:16:25.36 --> 03:16:30.88
I think I'm assuming. But so, like, if I were to be like, hey, jok. It would be like, hey,

2470
03:16:30.88 --> 03:16:35.36
jok will like do this. If you're hardcore, like you would do this, right? Something that

2471
03:16:35.36 --> 03:16:39.36
maybe didn't want to do, where you said no to or something like that. If I said it that straightforward,

2472
03:16:39.36 --> 03:16:43.52
you, you know what I'm doing. You'd figure it out and be like, hey, I'm not going to fall for that.

2473
03:16:43.52 --> 03:16:46.56
But if I just hinted at it, if you use the indirect approach,

2474
03:16:46.56 --> 03:16:51.52
indirect approach, maybe took a couple of days to maybe, you know, like, plant seeds and stuff like that.

2475
03:16:51.52 --> 03:16:55.76
Oh, I think I could get you. Fully to do some stuff. I don't know what. There's nothing wrong with

2476
03:16:55.76 --> 03:17:00.72
getting people to do stuff. I like it. I appreciate it a little bit of peer pressure and a positive way.

2477
03:17:00.72 --> 03:17:06.56
Let's go with it. You know, have I ever told you about the cliff on Koi? Um, on shipwreck speech?

2478
03:17:07.20 --> 03:17:11.84
No. Actually, I think I'm, you know what? No, I'm going to retract what I was about to. I was about

2479
03:17:11.84 --> 03:17:16.88
to say, I could get you to jump off that cliff. But you probably jump off that cliff. It's not a

2480
03:17:16.88 --> 03:17:22.72
job. That's scary. How many feet is it? It's not. It's, but this way, it's high, but not super high.

2481
03:17:22.72 --> 03:17:28.24
So is it over 100 feet? No, no, no, no. It was like, okay, so the last time I jumped with the last

2482
03:17:28.24 --> 03:17:33.68
time I went and I hadn't jumped for like a long time, probably like eight years, maybe. It's like

2483
03:17:33.68 --> 03:17:38.16
when you're young, you jump, it's fun. It's a little bit of a swim. Maybe 100 meters, wind back.

2484
03:17:38.16 --> 03:17:44.40
Give me an estimate on the height. Uh, 30, 35, maybe. Put it this way. I went to jump.

2485
03:17:44.40 --> 03:17:49.20
Throw that up in the ground. Me? No, that's what I'm saying. But I'm saying, if you have

2486
03:17:49.20 --> 03:17:55.60
in jump there, it's like, it can be intimidating. And people jump off there because they see

2487
03:17:55.60 --> 03:17:59.36
other people because everyone on the beach can see you jump. The cliff kind of wraps around and

2488
03:17:59.36 --> 03:18:06.32
the beach is literally like a, like, a audience. Perfect. Like spot. Sure. So when you jump,

2489
03:18:06.32 --> 03:18:11.20
everyone watches you, right? So what, they don't see you to do that. It's just you to jump off that

2490
03:18:11.20 --> 03:18:17.04
beach. Where she was a water woman. She's put the cape on back in H.I.

2491
03:18:18.24 --> 03:18:23.92
Who's on quiet, by the way? So when you go up there does two things. One, it makes you want to

2492
03:18:23.92 --> 03:18:27.84
like jump when you see other people. So, oh, that's fun. That'll be an adventure, right? You go.

2493
03:18:27.84 --> 03:18:32.56
And, but another thing that does is when you go up there and you send it to edge, everyone's watching.

2494
03:18:32.56 --> 03:18:37.04
So you can't turn back and walk down because you can be like, oh, you're the guy who walked down.

2495
03:18:37.04 --> 03:18:42.72
Yeah, you're going. So we went, I went with my 15 year old nephew. He was like, I want to do it.

2496
03:18:42.72 --> 03:18:46.88
I want to do it this time. So I'm like, cool. And he jumps. But before we jump, there's these,

2497
03:18:46.88 --> 03:18:50.64
there were these people up there. They didn't live there. So they're like, oh, he's going to jump.

2498
03:18:51.28 --> 03:18:55.44
And we're like, yeah, they're like, okay. Kind of like it was a bad idea.

2499
03:18:56.16 --> 03:19:01.60
So it was like, she's like, oh, our friend is still in the hospital because he broke his back

2500
03:19:01.60 --> 03:19:06.80
yesterday jumping off. So I was like, dang. So it's high enough to break your back.

2501
03:19:06.80 --> 03:19:12.08
But it depends on who you are. It also depends on what you hit. I mean, this person that broke their

2502
03:19:12.08 --> 03:19:16.56
back hit the bottom, no, it's not deep. So they're not breaking their back from just a regular jump.

2503
03:19:16.56 --> 03:19:21.20
If they're a normal person at 35 feet, bro. That's there's some other, there's some other

2504
03:19:21.84 --> 03:19:26.72
elements of the story that we're hearing. Here's what he was, basically, he was 50 years old.

2505
03:19:27.60 --> 03:19:31.44
Okay. I'm 50 years old. I'm not breaking my back jump. No, I believe 100%

2506
03:19:31.44 --> 03:19:35.28
you're not breaking their back when you can. But you're not the average 50 years old, the year old person.

2507
03:19:35.68 --> 03:19:39.60
And if you land a certain way, like, oh, yeah, you can break your back, I think. And then

2508
03:19:39.60 --> 03:19:44.72
not the kind of rebroadcast back in he was like, done. He, he like, you know, had a fractured one of

2509
03:19:44.72 --> 03:19:49.04
his vertebrae in this way. He's in the hospital for more than a day though. So well, weird things

2510
03:19:49.04 --> 03:19:53.20
can happen where it comes in. Drew, that's true. You can take that into account. I don't want to be

2511
03:19:53.20 --> 03:19:57.36
talking too much smack over here. Plus you have to be careful. But in your case, I just call you

2512
03:19:57.36 --> 03:20:03.84
not hardcore and you'll do anything. Yeah. Well, everyone, thanks for listening. Thanks for

2513
03:20:03.84 --> 03:20:09.44
hanging out with a little gift gift in me. If you want to help us out with supporting what we're

2514
03:20:09.44 --> 03:20:14.64
doing, check out jockelfuel.com. We got some, we got some tasty goodness on there, which is a weird

2515
03:20:14.64 --> 03:20:18.32
thing. You say first thing people think about when they think of supplements, they're not generally

2516
03:20:18.32 --> 03:20:26.32
thinking like, oh, tasty. Sometimes they even don't think tasty. The first thing I said was tasty.

2517
03:20:26.32 --> 03:20:30.56
Why? Because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because of fun.

2518
03:20:30.56 --> 03:20:36.40
It's a fun runner in food to take into your body and and enjoy that process. Actually,

2519
03:20:36.96 --> 03:20:41.84
well, man, then help remember the, remember the free-gid protein shakes percond the day. Yeah.

2520
03:20:41.84 --> 03:20:50.08
There was so bad. I was on our org poll tune on a ship. And we had the the latest and greatest

2521
03:20:50.08 --> 03:20:56.88
and everyone had it. It was so, it tasted so bad. I was vanilla. I remember I used to have to hold my

2522
03:20:56.88 --> 03:21:02.000
nose because I was on the train, right? We were doing really stuff. We're trying to get your act.

2523
03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:10.40
I would hold my nose and do it like I'm doing a shot at the keva. So that's how, that's not what we want.

2524
03:21:10.40 --> 03:21:15.76
No, have a good taste. Or remember the old school freaking Mega Mass 5 million or whatever,

2525
03:21:15.76 --> 03:21:21.12
really in the one in the big dog, food bag or whatever. That tasted good. But I think it had like

2526
03:21:21.12 --> 03:21:25.44
boatloads like sugar. Yeah, it was a stretch of the. It's just like, check it out. Technically,

2527
03:21:25.44 --> 03:21:29.28
he had more protein or whatever. Well, that were also like, hey, this is for gaining mass.

2528
03:21:29.28 --> 03:21:34.80
Yeah. So we're literally just going to give you sugar, fat, protein, just whatever.

2529
03:21:34.80 --> 03:21:38.48
Which is going to throw it in there. Make it taste good. Hey, more power to you. If you're a,

2530
03:21:38.48 --> 03:21:43.12
if you're a hard gamer, remember that bag of the day, the hard gator coming in hot.

2531
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:48.80
And then with the two three body types, right, there's a morph, echo morph. What's the other one?

2532
03:21:48.80 --> 03:21:53.36
Endo. Endo morph. Right. There you go. So they'd have those little graphs. You know, maybe

2533
03:21:53.36 --> 03:21:58.08
you need something. Is that a real thing? No. I have no idea. I think it is a thing. But I don't know

2534
03:21:58.08 --> 03:22:02.64
what determines that thing. Oh, yeah. Because I don't know if it what's the, you know what, let's face it.

2535
03:22:02.64 --> 03:22:06.80
There's some truth to it because there's some dudes that I know that would just eat with

2536
03:22:06.80 --> 03:22:11.20
pizzas and whatever and they're lean. Yep. That's true. So they might be the hard gator. Yeah.

2537
03:22:11.20 --> 03:22:14.24
And then some people doesn't matter. They lift or not. They're kind of jacked.

2538
03:22:14.24 --> 03:22:19.84
Yep. I know people like that. I know some people that work all out like crazy.

2539
03:22:19.84 --> 03:22:24.88
Yeah. And they don't look like it. And they can be even be strong. Yeah. And even be fast. But they

2540
03:22:24.88 --> 03:22:29.44
still look like kind of dumpy. Yeah. That is true. So I guess the thing is a thing. Yeah.

2541
03:22:29.44 --> 03:22:34.48
So we're going to watch out for that one. Yeah. I literally know a someone like immediately

2542
03:22:34.48 --> 03:22:38.08
comes to mind for every single one of those. That's interesting. Yeah. All right. Well, you

2543
03:22:38.08 --> 03:22:43.52
got to watch out for that. Of course. So know your body type. Yeah. Right. Also speaking of taste. Good.

2544
03:22:43.52 --> 03:22:48.08
The energy drinks. Healthy energy drinks too. But we just go rare thing. Very rare.

2545
03:22:48.08 --> 03:22:51.76
Good way you need things. Get some of those. And you can get this stuff at jockelfield.com.

2546
03:22:51.76 --> 03:22:55.84
You can get it while I get the drinks at wall. You can get it. You can get all the stuff

2547
03:22:55.84 --> 03:23:00.16
at vitamin shop as well. So check that out. Also, if you need some GJ2 gear, which you probably

2548
03:23:00.16 --> 03:23:06.64
do, go to originusa.com. And what's cool is we started with GJ2 gear, but now we're making

2549
03:23:06.64 --> 03:23:16.48
just a straight gear for your life. Jeans. T-shirts, hoodies, boots. Whatever you need, we got it.

2550
03:23:16.48 --> 03:23:23.04
So check some of that out. The jeans. And I don't know why these ones struck me. So hard or whatever.

2551
03:23:23.04 --> 03:23:29.68
It's the new jeans that they're coming out. They're like green or something. One that

2552
03:23:29.68 --> 03:23:35.44
piece said the next one is going to be camel. The work. They're work pants. Yeah. I don't know if I

2553
03:23:35.44 --> 03:23:39.20
do the work. Actually, I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm pretty sure they're going to

2554
03:23:39.20 --> 03:23:46.96
do the work. That's required. He's called the good offense. But I do want the best qualified

2555
03:23:46.96 --> 03:23:53.20
one. The worst pants across the board. Yeah, they got any padding in the knee. Let's face it.

2556
03:23:53.20 --> 03:23:57.52
That padding is not going to get any any action. No use for my work. That's for the abcher.

2557
03:23:57.52 --> 03:24:03.76
But nonetheless, for people who do do work, these are both functional. And instead, I'm

2558
03:24:03.76 --> 03:24:07.60
looking at them. And I want them, you know, just for the look alone. And then I know they're

2559
03:24:07.60 --> 03:24:12.56
probably more functional than they look at. So they say in a lot. Or do USA dot com, go and get yourself

2560
03:24:12.56 --> 03:24:18.16
some gear. And by the way, support an American company that's rebuilding American manufacturer

2561
03:24:18.16 --> 03:24:23.60
and helping American communities and workers. That's what we're about. That's work. Because

2562
03:24:23.60 --> 03:24:29.28
if we're worried about that, guess what we're doing? Hiring some slave labor overseas in China to

2563
03:24:29.28 --> 03:24:33.84
make everything for us. Make it a little bit more profit. Make a little bit more probably. We

2564
03:24:33.84 --> 03:24:40.08
we can stuff a little bit more money in our pockets over here. To rip it out of the hearts of the

2565
03:24:40.08 --> 03:24:44.72
American worker. We're not doing that. That's not what we're doing. So where's new essay dot com?

2566
03:24:44.72 --> 03:24:50.96
Go check it out. There you go. It's true. Also, when you're in the mood to represent on this path,

2567
03:24:50.96 --> 03:24:56.72
hey, look, we're capable. Which kind of reminds me, you know how like, and some of the guests will

2568
03:24:56.72 --> 03:25:00.56
have this where they'll talk about like their background or whatever. And then, you know, they went

2569
03:25:00.56 --> 03:25:03.52
through this and went through that. They already have this certification or this, you know,

2570
03:25:04.56 --> 03:25:08.72
like makes you think, man, those certifi, and there's a lot of them available, by the way.

2571
03:25:08.72 --> 03:25:14.96
Like certification. Yeah, like GIF mentioned, he was a patty diver. Yeah, before he even during

2572
03:25:14.96 --> 03:25:20.64
the Navy, maybe. Yeah, and he wasn't even really young. I never dove on scuba year until I was in the Navy.

2573
03:25:20.64 --> 03:25:24.72
Yeah, see, and that's one that I always was like, man, that'd be a cool one. Because

2574
03:25:24.72 --> 03:25:30.16
I'm a good guy. But you dive? Yeah, I grew up diving. Scuba diving? No, never. So snorkeling. Free diving

2575
03:25:30.16 --> 03:25:36.88
we call it. Yeah. Wait, wasn't who was it? Um, Mike, all right. Was it my free diving? Yeah. And if we didn't

2576
03:25:36.88 --> 03:25:43.52
go into that, he was some kind of world class, uh, bro. My younger brother, Yata Charles. Yeah. He is heavy,

2577
03:25:43.52 --> 03:25:47.52
not so much in Moria's kids and all that stuff. Now, but he's heavy into free diving, spearfishing

2578
03:25:47.52 --> 03:25:51.44
all this stuff. Really good, too. One of his friends, I know, my colors. I don't know that's why.

2579
03:25:51.44 --> 03:25:55.76
And when I kind of asked him to get up there. Yeah, man, he and one of his friends actually, I think

2580
03:25:55.76 --> 03:26:00.88
still holds the record of the deepest free dive. If I'm not mistaken, could be mistaken, but I'm pretty

2581
03:26:00.88 --> 03:26:06.48
sure. He showed me the videos freaking crazy. Nonetheless, I know a little bit about free diving.

2582
03:26:06.48 --> 03:26:10.32
And but and scuba diving has always been like kind of like, oh man, that'd be a cool in depth.

2583
03:26:10.32 --> 03:26:16.72
You can just stay down and breathe. Same thing. The kind of dive rig that you eventually end up using

2584
03:26:16.72 --> 03:26:22.32
in the sail team is which is called the rebreether, a rebreether. And it has no bubbles. Yeah.

2585
03:26:23.20 --> 03:26:28.16
And when you're down there, it just like quiet. It's like, yeah. It's not like a normal,

2586
03:26:28.16 --> 03:26:32.72
a normal when you're scuba diving with a normal, what's called an open circuit rig. He's like,

2587
03:26:33.92 --> 03:26:39.12
it's all noisy. These bubbles everywhere. And I don't like it at all. And I've just spent way more.

2588
03:26:39.68 --> 03:26:43.84
I've probably spent a hundred times more in my life on Drager.

2589
03:26:43.84 --> 03:26:49.20
What's Drager's the rebreether? Then open circuit. Open circuit. You basically do it in

2590
03:26:49.20 --> 03:26:54.08
buds. You get qualified. And then as soon as you're done with that, you go on close circuit.

2591
03:26:54.08 --> 03:26:58.08
And that's where you dive for the rest of your career. Maybe every once in a blue moon,

2592
03:26:58.08 --> 03:27:03.12
you dive open circuit. I can't. I think I do open circuit on a ship one time to like clear some

2593
03:27:03.92 --> 03:27:10.48
some seaweed out of something or something like this. But have you ever gone scuba diving in any

2594
03:27:10.48 --> 03:27:15.44
capacity after you retired from the need? No. Would you like is that your jet? Like would you?

2595
03:27:15.44 --> 03:27:21.44
If I could get a rebreether? Yes. Like just to go or what? If I was like, let's say we were

2596
03:27:21.44 --> 03:27:26.64
went back to Hawaii and we were just going to go diving. And I could use a rebreether. I'd probably

2597
03:27:26.64 --> 03:27:33.04
look into it. Maybe do it. A rebreether is like a failable or is they are? But I don't know what the rules are.

2598
03:27:33.04 --> 03:27:37.92
You know? They're like, Pluto. No, no, they are available. I've looked at a human by one,

2599
03:27:37.92 --> 03:27:42.96
like $5 or $6,000. How much is the regular school or regular? Like a middle of the road?

2600
03:27:42.96 --> 03:27:48.000
I would guess $1500 bucks for the whole thing if you went over to the dive shop and hooked it up.

2601
03:27:49.84 --> 03:27:54.16
But that seems like to me anyway. That seems like a cool little just certification. You can just

2602
03:27:54.16 --> 03:27:58.000
decide to go get a new hat. Just like even like the guns thing, like you know,

2603
03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:03.28
how does those kind of certification just have more capability overall? You just choose planning?

2604
03:28:03.28 --> 03:28:07.52
Yeah, and there's people that chase those little qualifications, right? Yeah. And I did it. Yeah.

2605
03:28:07.52 --> 03:28:11.60
But I mean, of course, just like anything else. It's like, you know, if you don't want to do it for

2606
03:28:11.60 --> 03:28:16.32
nothing, they got to be applicable. I would think anyway. Yeah. But it's better to have the capability

2607
03:28:16.32 --> 03:28:20.16
and certification than that. Let's build capability. There's what is what we're saying. You know,

2608
03:28:20.16 --> 03:28:25.76
what you want to randomly got, it's not random as for a reason. But it seems, but it seems like you

2609
03:28:25.76 --> 03:28:29.84
would never just think to go get it. But once you kind of think about it for a second, it's like

2610
03:28:29.84 --> 03:28:38.08
super duper useful is CPR. Yeah. I'm CPR certified. And due to you put that on your resume for this

2611
03:28:38.08 --> 03:28:44.64
job. I'm just saying if you blackout or something like this, I got you ready to say. Dude, I didn't know

2612
03:28:44.64 --> 03:28:51.36
I've been dealing with highly qualified. Hollywood quality. I told you, I told you it's small, but it's

2613
03:28:51.36 --> 03:28:56.24
one of those things. You can just get and it's better to have all better than I'm not having

2614
03:28:56.24 --> 03:28:59.36
a problem at all. But I'm just saying it's one of those things. What did you like a plight of college?

2615
03:28:59.36 --> 03:29:08.56
You can't digress. Jack. All right. So there you go. We don't know you're down. If you go down,

2616
03:29:08.56 --> 03:29:16.32
remember, text echo Charles, he'll come and get you CPR. He's qualified. It's like a 15 minute class.

2617
03:29:16.96 --> 03:29:21.04
But I don't even know I tell you these things. I don't know anything. I don't know why you do

2618
03:29:21.04 --> 03:29:27.04
that. It's ridiculous. Either way. If you want to represent while you're on the path, CPR certified

2619
03:29:27.04 --> 03:29:35.36
or not, go to jockelstore.com. You can get your uh, this clinical freedom, shirts and hats and

2620
03:29:35.36 --> 03:29:39.44
there's a lot of good stuff on there. Check it out. If you want something, get something to represent.

2621
03:29:39.44 --> 03:29:42.96
Don't forget we got some other podcasts too. We got the jockel on rambling, but they're a

2622
03:29:42.96 --> 03:29:47.28
Cooper. Got the ground upon cast where you're kid podcast. We got jockel on the ground. That's a

2623
03:29:47.28 --> 03:29:54.08
huge way to support. There's people getting banned. You got what just happened? Neil Young told Spotify,

2624
03:29:54.08 --> 03:30:00.96
get rogan off. Get him off. Get him off. And guess what happened? Did you see the outcome?

2625
03:30:01.68 --> 03:30:08.96
Neil Young's off Spotify. We should say we want Joe Rogan off Spotify.

2626
03:30:09.68 --> 03:30:12.80
Well, we're gonna have to get this off to me. Who are you?

2627
03:30:12.80 --> 03:30:22.64
But listen, that's a scenario that happened. Luckily Spotify made the call to keep Joe Rogan

2628
03:30:22.64 --> 03:30:27.76
because Neil Young cool. I don't know if that happened across B. Still's Nash and Young as well.

2629
03:30:27.76 --> 03:30:32.72
I don't know if he screwed over all of his old bandmates too. You know who knows what happened there.

2630
03:30:32.72 --> 03:30:37.44
Good old Neil Young. But you jacked it up, son. So we don't know what's gonna happen. We don't

2631
03:30:37.44 --> 03:30:42.80
have somebody's gonna come on on the apple and we don't know if some big band of Neil Young's

2632
03:30:42.80 --> 03:30:48.08
going to go on an apple and say, hey, take down jockel podcast because I don't like what they're saying

2633
03:30:48.08 --> 03:30:52.80
about CPR calls. So we don't know if that's going to happen. So that's where we have jockel on

2634
03:30:52.80 --> 03:30:57.36
the ground. So if you want to get on board there, you want to help us out cause $8.18 a month

2635
03:30:57.36 --> 03:31:05.28
to come and we have a podcast that we do there. A little bit of a project to pass more information.

2636
03:31:05.28 --> 03:31:09.28
If you can't afford it, it's okay. Email assistance at jocconoground.com. So you can be in the

2637
03:31:09.28 --> 03:31:14.40
game. Check out our YouTube channel. Check out flipsidegamvis.com with the code of my bag. Check it out.

2638
03:31:14.40 --> 03:31:19.84
I wrote a bunch of books. Check them out. I would say especially check out the kids books.

2639
03:31:19.84 --> 03:31:24.40
Most people know I've written some books but some people don't know I wrote kids books. Kids books.

2640
03:31:24.40 --> 03:31:31.44
Keep them kids on the path. And also we have Ashlan Front, which is our leadership consultancy.

2641
03:31:31.44 --> 03:31:38.88
If you want to have us help you with your leadership, go to extremeownership.com and a online training

2642
03:31:38.88 --> 03:31:43.92
platform. So look, a few years ago, if someone said, hey, you don't really want to learn about leadership,

2643
03:31:45.84 --> 03:31:50.32
do you can you help me? I'd say, yeah, just listen to my podcast, man. And they'd be like,

2644
03:31:50.32 --> 03:31:57.04
okay, cool. Thanks. And they'd listen. There's good information. But now there's 300 plus podcast.

2645
03:31:57.04 --> 03:32:02.40
And they're about war and they're about atrocities. And so the leadership lessons are

2646
03:32:02.40 --> 03:32:10.32
strewn throughout. So we this is one thing that we've done to sort of, hey, let's get these things

2647
03:32:10.32 --> 03:32:16.000
into a consolidated curriculum where you can literally learn from step A through step Z. There you go.

2648
03:32:16.000 --> 03:32:21.20
Go to extremeownership.com. A little story about the word strewn. So I got two, I got three

2649
03:32:21.20 --> 03:32:26.72
daughters to two older ones. They're very, you know, articulate. Well, they also get

2650
03:32:26.72 --> 03:32:33.04
hostile. You know, so that too. And they shared room for a long time. And they still share a room

2651
03:32:33.04 --> 03:32:41.04
when they're home. But one of them wrote the older one wrote a message to the younger one that

2652
03:32:41.04 --> 03:32:48.32
said, you know, something along the lines of, listen, I just got home. I've been out all day working.

2653
03:32:48.32 --> 03:32:52.32
And I just got home. And as soon as I walked into a room, I could barely get in there because you had

2654
03:32:52.32 --> 03:32:58.24
your clothes and your stuff strewn about the floor. And I would really appreciate if you come home

2655
03:32:58.24 --> 03:33:06.96
and clean this up. And my middle daughter replied, strewn. That's all she wrote back.

2656
03:33:08.24 --> 03:33:13.76
So I thought that was pretty funny. strewn. So now it's a joke and inside of our family. If there's

2657
03:33:13.76 --> 03:33:18.24
something been left out, then it's been, there's then it's strewn about and then the response is just

2658
03:33:18.24 --> 03:33:23.60
straight out of the screws. And if you want to help service members active on the tire, go check out

2659

2661
03:33:36.88 --> 03:33:42.56
reason, we're on social. Watch out for the algorithm. I'm not trying to draw you into the algorithm.

2662
03:33:42.56 --> 03:33:47.68
Where that thing grabs a hold of your soul and drags you down, reading into comments and

2663
03:33:47.68 --> 03:33:53.12
feeling bad about yourself and scanning to another screen to another one. I want you to do that.

2664
03:33:54.40 --> 03:34:00.56
I don't want you to do that. I'd rather you not do that. But if you feel like, oh, I got a question.

2665
03:34:00.56 --> 03:34:08.000
I want to see what's happening. Cool. We're on the gram, we're on Facebook, we're on Twitter,

2666
03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:12.96
Echo's Adact patrols. I am at Jocca Willick. And once again, if you want to hang out with Chris

2667
03:34:12.96 --> 03:34:22.40
Gifford and his wife Julie, go to Instagram, taking leave underscore RV. There you go. That's

2668
03:34:22.40 --> 03:34:26.40
Julie and Chris, who knows what they got going on out there in the world in that air stream. What

2669
03:34:26.40 --> 03:34:33.68
is a 34 air stream? Yeah, that's a nice ride right there. Yeah, nice ride. And speaking of Chris,

2670
03:34:33.68 --> 03:34:38.80
Gifford, just want to say thanks once again to Chris on his travels. He was nice enough to stop by.

2671
03:34:38.80 --> 03:34:47.12
He was a silent professional in the teams and a pro and appreciate it. Appreciate your service.

2672
03:34:47.12 --> 03:34:54.24
And thanks for coming by and to all the other vets out there. Both the vets and also the folks

2673
03:34:54.24 --> 03:35:00.56
that are still active duty, manning the watch worldwide. Thank you for your continued service.

2674
03:35:00.56 --> 03:35:05.28
And to our police and law enforcement of firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2675
03:35:05.28 --> 03:35:10.16
correctional officers, board of patrols, secretaries, all first responders. Thanks for

2676
03:35:10.16 --> 03:35:17.92
manning the watch here at home and to everyone else. Everyone else, remember what Chris did with his

2677
03:35:17.92 --> 03:35:26.16
life. He said a goal and then he went out and he achieved it. And then he did that again and again and

2678
03:35:26.16 --> 03:35:36.64
that is a good plan. So go out there, come up with a goal and execute by getting after it.

2679
03:35:36.64 --> 03:35:57.44
And until next time, the Zekko and Jocko out.
