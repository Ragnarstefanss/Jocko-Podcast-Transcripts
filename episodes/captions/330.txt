[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 330 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:08] A little after midnight on Thanksgiving
[00:00:12] 1943 while patrolling the black waters off Cape St. George near New Guinea
[00:00:18] Berks five ship Wolfpack
[00:00:21] spotted a Japanese radar contact
[00:00:24] immediately and without permission
[00:00:27] Burke radioed his squadron
[00:00:30] hold your hats boys here we go
[00:00:35] into the dark and into the enemies guns
[00:00:37] Berks destroyers drop throttles to flank speed and launch torpedoes
[00:00:41] exploding two Japanese ships outright
[00:00:44] then wheeled to star bird
[00:00:46] like the Parthine courses archers
[00:00:50] into the face of three more enemy ships
[00:00:53] that immediately tucked tail and fled in the night long pursuit
[00:00:58] Berks dex sailors discharge and loaded their guns so fast
[00:01:01] and so long that many passed out in their turrets from the fumes
[00:01:06] and from sheer exhaustion
[00:01:09] when Berks squadron finally returned to port
[00:01:13] set a time magazine reporter every ship in the road stead turned up its search lights
[00:01:19] and every blue jacket in the fleet man the rails in tribute
[00:01:25] it was Halsey said afterward the classic
[00:01:28] c-action of this war
[00:01:33] for 13 months
[00:01:34] Burke commanded his destroyers like patented his tanks
[00:01:38] to every order he invariably responded
[00:01:42] preceding at 31 knots
[00:01:45] a boiler bursting pace said one historian
[00:01:48] that caught admiral William Bowel Hallsey's attention
[00:01:51] who addressed the few his future dispatches to 31 knot Burke
[00:01:57] the name stuck
[00:02:01] in the last two years the war Burke was forced to give up command of his own squadron
[00:02:05] in order to become chief of staff
[00:02:07] to mark missioner famous aircraft carrier admiral
[00:02:10] neither a pilot nor possessing any experience in aircraft carriers
[00:02:14] Burke was at first out of place in the new staff role
[00:02:17] an onlooker to the aviators and a jolt to his morale
[00:02:20] that almost immediately expanded to his waistline
[00:02:24] essentially confined to the flag plot the ship's tactical command center
[00:02:28] Burke was forced not only to learn everything he could about aircraft carriers
[00:02:32] and their tactics but also to elevate his operational understanding
[00:02:36] beyond the amateur's urge for the battle at hand in order to plan for the next one
[00:02:42] beyond the Marianas to the Philippine sea
[00:02:44] beyond that to late-a-golf then onto Ewo Jima
[00:02:49] when submarine intelligence told him the battleship
[00:02:53] Yamoto was spotted and route to an unknown location
[00:02:57] he spent all night hunched over his charge
[00:03:00] charts a caliper in hand then launched 400 planes against the spot
[00:03:06] where he would be if the rules were reversed
[00:03:10] and sank the ship with more than 3000 men aboard
[00:03:13] before his planes returned to Burke had already switched his attention to the next battle
[00:03:18] by the time they reached Ocanawa the final terrible fight of the World War of World War II
[00:03:24] Burke had settled into a punishing routine
[00:03:27] always up at 0 330 the sleep he did manage was usually interrupted by some 20 calls a night
[00:03:33] in his waking hours Burke watched nightmares unfold his only sanctuary the flashes of
[00:03:39] courage that for years to come set a biographer would seem to whisper to him
[00:03:43] something about the meaning of the US Navy
[00:03:48] the worst of these and the greatest was the final transmission of a newly commissioned
[00:03:54] ensin who had taken command of his crippled destroyer after everyone else in his chain of command
[00:04:00] had been killed
[00:04:03] before the ship sank and the transmission was caught off
[00:04:06] Burke heard the young man say quote
[00:04:10] I will fight this ship to the best of my ability and forgive me the mistakes I am about to make
[00:04:15] and quote
[00:04:19] that voice would haunt and steal him for the rest of his life
[00:04:24] and that is an emotion and a haunting that I think many of us feel
[00:04:43] did I do enough to train the young leaders that followed me
[00:04:47] and the answer always seems to be no I could have done more I could have passed on
[00:04:54] more lessons learned I could have done a better job teaching our operational history to the next
[00:05:00] generation so that they would not repeat the mistakes we made
[00:05:07] but there's so much to teach and there's so much to learn and there's so many lessons to pass on
[00:05:11] and sometimes lessons don't get passed on they get forgotten
[00:05:20] and only the deepest of dedication and research and commitment can bring
[00:05:27] those lessons back
[00:05:31] and that reading that I opened with was an excerpt from the book
[00:05:36] the book is called by water beneath the walls which was written by a friend of mine
[00:05:44] a seal teammate of mine by the name of Ben Milligan Ben has been on this podcast before
[00:05:51] it's podcast number 298 go listen to that if you haven't listened to it yet but on that podcast
[00:05:59] we discussed where Ben came from how he ended up in the seal teams
[00:06:01] and how we ended up writing this incredible book which took him seven years to write
[00:06:09] and the book is an amazing book I think this is the most important historical book
[00:06:14] I have ever read on the seal teams and I think it actually might be the most important book
[00:06:20] on special operations as a whole that I have read and if you haven't read this book
[00:06:26] by it immediately it is absolutely an incredible look at the history of the seal teams
[00:06:34] but it ties in so many other aspects of the military and special operations and the wars we've been through
[00:06:43] and the amount of commitment that it took to write this was one amount of commitment
[00:06:50] that can come from only someone with Ben's personality and his his drive to find out
[00:06:57] in unravel history and we're lucky enough to have Ben back with us to discuss
[00:07:04] more of these incredible accounts of histories history from the seal teams
[00:07:09] and of the entire community of special operations so Ben thanks for coming back man
[00:07:16] thanks Joko it's great to be here and thanks for that section to it's one of my favorite
[00:07:25] sections in the book one of the hardest things you do when you write a book is you have to
[00:07:33] edit it and you have to cut it and I think we talked about that last time this was one of those
[00:07:37] sections that I had probably 15 more pages just on berk that I had dropped my that chapter
[00:07:43] have been completely structured differently I had started with berk at his change of commands
[00:07:48] ceremony when he became the CNO and then I rolled into you know this you know 15 page just
[00:07:56] it was my biggest introduction of a character even bigger probably than draper off
[00:08:03] I justifi that and I have when I was writing it because I always felt like berk or at least
[00:08:07] when I discovered berk when I discovered his contribution to the creation of the seal
[00:08:11] teams I felt like next to Phil Buckleau early berk is the indispensable man he the seal
[00:08:21] teams would not have existed without him without and the it wouldn't have existed without his
[00:08:27] biography that he just consolidated into you know this complete preoccupation with keeping the
[00:08:34] navy connected to offensive warfare and and there was just example after example of his time in
[00:08:41] world war two you know there were he was in at least two two vessel pants shot out from under
[00:08:49] hammer two two vessels were sunk by the Japanese that he had to and he had to escape from and in each
[00:08:54] instance of his cape he was leaving behind every possession that he had every possession that
[00:08:59] he had gone through the war with and in the process he was rescuing guys around him
[00:09:03] and in one case wrist his life going into a completely smoke filled passageway to rescue a
[00:09:15] I think it was a semen like a radio radio man and he's the you know the chief staff of the ship
[00:09:21] and he had no business he get off the ship but he's you know saving the sailors around him
[00:09:25] but yeah he was like you like you mentioned in your you're opening the his commitment to passing
[00:09:42] on what he had learned not just what he had learned but his belief in what the navy was
[00:09:49] to that next generation that's what kept him as a seano for six years I guess say in the book it's
[00:09:55] two years longer than any even the closest competitor seano is normally just a two-year spot
[00:10:02] animal king who's the seano during world war two he serves for four but after king nobody
[00:10:08] else comes close except Burke and Burke's there for six years and whenever I know that you
[00:10:15] know you take pictures of your watch and you're still working at a fourth thirty just funny because
[00:10:20] I often thought that I should start taking a picture of my watch when I sit down like computers
[00:10:24] to writing I'm not sure would be motivating but whenever I hear somebody talk about how you have to
[00:10:32] get eight hours asleep and I sleep the most important thing like man I know that you're wrong
[00:10:38] and I know because of Burke I know because of every you know other people you hi achievers like
[00:10:43] somebody like Burke he never slept yeah that that why that passage stood out to me and look I've
[00:10:52] got so many marks in this book now from the last time we did this and just from reading it but that
[00:10:58] that idea that here's this guy who's listening to a young ensin go down with his ship and he's
[00:11:07] thinking to himself you know after this guy says forgive me the mistakes I'm about to make and you know
[00:11:12] Arlie Burke sitting there thinking he could have taught him he could have given him a heads up he could have
[00:11:17] given whoever that commander was or the lieutenant commander or the lieutenant that was above
[00:11:23] this guy in the chain of command all these guys could he could have taught them something that
[00:11:27] maybe they wouldn't be in this situation and just knowing that every effort that you gave
[00:11:33] to pass on the lessons they failed and now this this guy is just young man just young
[00:11:39] ensin is dying and he's gonna go down with his ship with all these sailors on board and
[00:11:44] there's there's just all these lessons and and I mean there's so many times where when I was in
[00:11:51] the teams well good example is Mike Thornton you know Mike Thornton came on this podcast a
[00:11:57] couple years ago and we went moment by moment and debriefed the the operation where he for which he
[00:12:06] was awarded the the Medal of Honor and it's it's three hours it's like a three hour debrief
[00:12:13] and I was in the sealed teams with at the same time as Mike Thornton I knew Mike Thornton
[00:12:21] I had met Mike Thornton several occasions I'd spent time with Mike Thornton
[00:12:26] but I'd never gotten like a full debrief of what happened and you think to yourself all those
[00:12:32] lessons that didn't get passed on until he came on the podcast and told me like all these
[00:12:38] little lessons and then you start thinking about someone like Burke or or this entire book that you've
[00:12:44] written where there's just all these lessons that are completely forgotten and well I should say they're
[00:12:51] almost completely forgotten I don't know if they're completely forgotten I know I know the point
[00:12:54] you're trying to make and I agree like um since the book has come out I've been keeping a list there's
[00:12:59] been 12 12 guys that I interviewed in the course of the book that aren't with us anymore and
[00:13:06] I always think like what what happened if I had started the book a year late or a year later
[00:13:10] than I did or what opportunities did I miss because I started the book when I did and not two
[00:13:14] years earlier like how many how many stories did I miss or how many lessons did I miss um
[00:13:20] the one thing that I think about when I think of like um you know somebody who's as young as
[00:13:26] that Ensign was in the section that you read um who's going down I mean that Ensign
[00:13:31] Mike Thornton when he's I think Mike Thornton was 25 when he rescued Tommy Norse
[00:13:37] he's not old enough I mean he's old enough to he's he's a he's a grown man I mean he's uh
[00:13:43] he has a 25 year old's perspective on life but he doesn't have all the context that you know
[00:13:47] that you and I have and echo we live long lives I mean we've we've been around here for a minute
[00:13:53] and we've collected stories and we've collected context um and we have uh you know enough um
[00:14:01] you know ammunition you know whether it's morally or or whatever to help us or to convince us
[00:14:09] to to to make right decisions um but somebody's 25 years old or this Ensign I imagine this
[00:14:16] Ensign you know probably 22 years old like I just didn't know anything doesn't know anything about
[00:14:21] the world he hasn't heard you know stories you know like the one that you just read um but what
[00:14:28] he does have uh he has this uh he's been imprinted by the institution that he served him and
[00:14:35] by the people that are around him um and that's I think that's an important um thing you know
[00:14:41] buddhas or bootcamp does you're you're taking uh young folks and you know from lots of
[00:14:47] different backgrounds and without you know the context that we have as you get older and you read books
[00:14:51] and you have these experiences but you imprint you know the values of that institution on these
[00:14:57] people and you give them uh new mandates for what's expected um and that's cool yeah and I appreciate
[00:15:06] that but you know like like I said this this Ensign wasn't in charge of the ship right there was
[00:15:14] uh there was an exo there was a seal there was an ops boss there all now dead and even with the
[00:15:21] imprints of kind of the broad value system that we have in the navy or the broad value system that
[00:15:29] you have in the Marine Corps the broad value system that you have in the army there are actual
[00:15:34] tactics that you can know that can save your ass in certain situations and you know when I was
[00:15:42] in trade at like I remember sometimes especially when I first got home from her body I would be
[00:15:47] watching a guy move through the streets in in Mount training right and I would feel like sick
[00:15:53] to my stomach if a guy wasn't taking cover and it's a really simple thing that hate someone tells
[00:16:00] you like listen man only move from cover to cover don't ever be in a spot where you're standing
[00:16:04] and you're not in cover don't ever let that happen when you're not behind cover you're moving
[00:16:09] that's the way it is obviously wasn't instinctual to a bunch of people coming through you know
[00:16:14] advanced seal training coming coming through work up there would be out of every 10 new guys there
[00:16:20] would be three of them that would stand around in the open like nothing's gonna happen to them
[00:16:24] and so there's there's instincts and that's why when I read this past I was like
[00:16:28] the feeling of the sickness that I can only imagine it's even worse for him because he's thinking
[00:16:34] here's another ship with however many 300 souls going down on it and I know that
[00:16:43] I could have had them you know do do whatever they could have done differently and the
[00:16:48] lessons just didn't get passed on and and that's why to me this book that you've written is so
[00:16:53] important because it does have lessons that I saw us relearn some of the lessons that you've
[00:17:00] gotten this book I watched this happen and so I'm glad I'm look I wish you would have written it earlier
[00:17:08] right I wish you would have written it 10 years ago or 15 years ago but you didn't because you're lazy
[00:17:16] but it took you seven years to write this thing and the lessons are just they're just
[00:17:22] awesome and they're important and you know you know the whole dynamic when you understand the
[00:17:29] whole dynamic of where where this personality comes from where this mode of operating that
[00:17:39] that is sort of look the seal teams everyone every sales a little bit different but there's some
[00:17:43] core things there that are that they're gonna be there no matter what seal you talked to from what
[00:17:47] generation they've got this they got a couple things in their soul and when people start to on those
[00:17:54] think conveyed but when people start to understand where that thing that little nugget in their soul
[00:17:59] where that came from and they go oh that's actually not just a that's not just a rock that's a cornerstone
[00:18:04] and we should focus on that we should remember that we should know where that came from we should
[00:18:07] know why that was important that we had that characteristic or we had that that that way of thinking
[00:18:13] about things and for me this book illuminated so many threads of the thought process that we have as
[00:18:21] seals where they came from to make sure when someone says well you know we need to just fall
[00:18:26] in mind with an answer actually we don't need to just fall in mind there's a reason that we think this
[00:18:31] way there's a reason that it's beneficial there's a reason that it's beneficial to keep an open mind
[00:18:35] there's a reason that it's beneficial to utilize decentralized command there's a reason for those
[00:18:39] things and we should never forget where they came from and the more we understand where they came from
[00:18:43] the more we can act upon them correctly all right so with that I'm sorry your book it's
[00:18:51] me super far to put about some stuff on the same thing so this uh my idea and I don't know how
[00:18:59] well we're gonna be able to stick this idea um because you have way too much freaking you have
[00:19:04] way too many facts and stories running around in your head and I've got too many questions running
[00:19:08] around in mind but my idea was to try and go through some of the chapters and like you just said you
[00:19:13] just said you got about 15 pages cut out 15 pages of early book by way did you actually write those
[00:19:18] 15 pages yeah they're written oh yeah I mean I had that's horrible some of it's like you know
[00:19:23] extremely some of it's like some of it's notes no no no I mean it's all written and it's all like I
[00:19:27] mean I mean I have not a paragraph but I have a couple sentences on Birch's wife like
[00:19:34] all right I need not all of the states you know but when you find like yeah I don't know
[00:19:40] your experience but when you're editing like if you're writing a novel I expect like the
[00:19:45] the uh the impulse when you're you know cutting stuff is that you know you have a turner phrase
[00:19:51] that you're really liking you're like oh man that is I mean that's the best thing that's been
[00:19:55] written since the Bible and you want to get rid of it and your editor tells you well nobody gets
[00:20:00] what you're trying to say it sucks you know you need to lose it but I think when you're you know
[00:20:05] when you're writing history uh and you're you've done all this research you've followed you know
[00:20:11] you know you know so many rabbit holes you've done so many requests the Navy yard or wherever you've
[00:20:15] gotten your material uh and you've found what you know think you think is this incredible document
[00:20:20] you want to use that stuff you you mean you fought for it you mean you want to put it in there
[00:20:26] I mean I have a lot of detail in these sentences I and I don't do that you know to
[00:20:33] make a reader you know frustrated I have it because you know I'm the way that I'm writing
[00:20:39] as I have four note cards that I'll sit in front of me and those four note cards you will usually
[00:20:43] have you know two or three points on them all star which one which point I have on each not
[00:20:46] note card and be like I want to put that that net in one sentence how do I do that I had a
[00:20:52] way fit all that you know stuff in there so yes I did I cut probably between ten and fifteen pages
[00:20:57] of Berks biography however when I when I rewrote the chapter I didn't completely lose that I mean
[00:21:04] I try to say that I I left as much on the field as possible I just you know compressed it into
[00:21:09] this really really you know tight diamond of of information but yeah everybody I mean I there were
[00:21:16] whole characters that I cut and I got better as time went on so um not when I was thinking about
[00:21:22] how we were going to do this and I started to go back through you know chapter by chapter you know
[00:21:26] what were sections that I cut what were sections that I lost and um you know not just characters
[00:21:31] but entire episodes I saw um I saw in these chapters my notes that I was putting together we're
[00:21:37] getting shorter and shorter and shorter each chapter because I was learning as I was doing this
[00:21:42] whole book and I did my research and I did my writing chapter by chapter I would research and write
[00:21:47] one chapter I would go back to an archive I'd collect all the stuff and I'd write that next chapter
[00:21:51] and then I'd do it again for the third chapter for whatever I was doing and I got better as I went
[00:21:57] um I'd rather identify what what was going to fit and also you must have seen a better
[00:22:03] of clear vision of the story arc yes and so you knew what was important and what was not
[00:22:07] much better and much better idea of the story and much better um respect for my reader
[00:22:14] because I was you know when I was reading this I was completely in love with my own pen
[00:22:19] I thought everything I wrote was fantastic I wrote the first chapter as the well
[00:22:22] and I'm I probably should just send this off to the Pulitzer Committee so they have just you
[00:22:27] know have this thing up front they'll they'll know what's coming eventually um but you know when I
[00:22:34] reread that chapter six months after I'd written it and I saw it's like I'm not sure why that
[00:22:39] character is in here it's like oh that I don't know about him either I found myself I had like
[00:22:44] I I did five introductions of five different characters in that first chapter before I really got
[00:22:51] to Carlson and his readers like that was I doing like I don't even know why I spent all that time
[00:22:57] doing it like I was just but I was learning you know even you're you're learning the process and
[00:23:01] you're learning how to get better as you go um but yeah you seem to think about the
[00:23:08] you seem to think about the reader a lot more than I do or you're like I don't want to put the
[00:23:12] reader through this I'm like well I'm the reader I mean I'm the reader I'm my imaginary I mean
[00:23:16] I'm I'm my own reader like I wrote like I said I wrote the book that I wanted to read and I you know
[00:23:23] but like you you have to think about your your reader you have to I released I felt felt like I have
[00:23:30] to think about my reader because otherwise I'm writing a diary I don't want to write a diary I
[00:23:33] want people to read what I'm writing I guess it closest I would come to you like a does this
[00:23:37] would this make sense if I was reading it so yeah I guess yeah you're you're you're about the
[00:23:40] reader a little bit you're your reader you're I mean I don't think about the reader sounds like
[00:23:44] you think about the reader sympathetically they're getting no sympathy for the reader you're
[00:23:47] like well I don't want to put the reader through some like I had the reader but I don't know if I
[00:23:53] like I my reader was I wanted it to be I wanted my reader to be you know a teen guy I wanted
[00:24:02] this book to be for this he was but I wanted my mom to be able to read it to so that when I was
[00:24:06] thinking like when I wrote this paragraph up was it sufficiently dense was it sufficiently what was
[00:24:13] there was there enough material and enough interesting things on that to you know to make me like
[00:24:18] oh that's that's good stuff but was it also written well enough that my mom could understand it
[00:24:23] that's what I was thinking about well also the last time that we were on here you asked me what my
[00:24:28] mom did and I just said that she was a housewife how that girl didn't go over creation so what's the
[00:24:33] real deal yeah I don't I don't have a great my mom was ever just said everything you set yourself up
[00:24:40] and that's the right thing she was got she was the chief of staff there you go that's a that's
[00:24:47] sounds better than housewife I guess yeah I'm unless you're a badass housewife in which
[00:24:51] case you're like yeah I'm a badass housewife what's up we know what that entails that means
[00:24:55] I'm the the the chief staff officer the chief financial officer the troop motivator you're everything
[00:25:02] yeah get an after it so there you go mom's so now she can stop being met at me it's a
[00:25:08] second let's later all right so my my thought was we go through this and talk about some of it
[00:25:13] because you know you and I had conversations during the during the podcast after the podcast
[00:25:17] about the amount of people the same thing you're saying right now you had to just cut things out
[00:25:20] cut stories out yeah and so many of these things can can be their own book can be their own store
[00:25:26] you could peel pull back the pull the thread or any of these characters and you can you could
[00:25:30] have your own book you have another book on just about any of these characters um but I thought just
[00:25:36] going through some of the chapter it's going through the chapters and talking about some of the
[00:25:40] things that didn't quite make it uh chapter one is called the reluct by the way I was thinking
[00:25:46] about this as I was putting this together chapter one is called the reluctant creation and violent
[00:25:50] demise of the Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders your subtitles for each chapter
[00:25:54] indicate that you have a lot to say and this is going to be a long book like chapter one the
[00:25:59] reluctant you know my books have like chapter one get some you know boom we're done right chapter two
[00:26:06] get more like I'm an idiot you're over here the reluctant creation and final demise of the
[00:26:10] Navy's first commandos the Marine Corps Raiders that was my editors that was Julian Pavilion he
[00:26:14] he sort of insisted so each of my chapters or something like I don't know like it wasn't it wasn't
[00:26:20] as tight as like Carlson's Raiders but it was something like the the only one that I remember is
[00:26:25] for chapter five from my unit days it was like the the Merum and before before they had come up with
[00:26:29] the frogmen is like a moniker for them they were calling them like the really clunky
[00:26:33] oh god that's awful especially after that move what's that movie echo Charles
[00:26:38] which one uh Zulander you know what I'm talking about so in the movie Zulander
[00:26:43] which has Owen Wilson in it who's like one of my favorite people all the time that guy seems so
[00:26:50] chill and cool and it also has Ben still or so Ben still plays like I was really dumb model
[00:26:57] a man model right and he comes from some fregan mining town in Pennsylvania or something
[00:27:04] and he's in this bar with his daddy's trying to be like more manly and his dad's in there
[00:27:10] and his dad's played by John Void John Void for dinner all they're all like covered in mine dust
[00:27:16] and Vince Fonds and there are no lines he's no line just no line just being tough and so Ben still
[00:27:23] is in there trying to be tougher and a and a commercial comes on the TV and it's him advertised
[00:27:30] some like fragrance and he's dressed up like a mermaid and his dad's like can't have you running
[00:27:36] around here as a damn mermaid and he says not a mermaid dad it's merman so that's what I thought
[00:27:44] of what I saw that's the I was reading through it just like did we really have to go there with the
[00:27:48] merman clunky's at the least all right so so but my yes so his point was you need to give the
[00:27:55] reader some idea of what's in store for them like if you start a chapter on the if you okay so
[00:28:03] imagine your reader you're picking up a book ostensibly about the Navy seals and that first chapter
[00:28:09] is you know you're reading paid you know three pages and it's all about the Marine Corps what the
[00:28:14] hell are you doing you have to give you know your reader some idea of what this is about and you know
[00:28:20] when I when I thought about you know I completely made sense because you know now I'm I'm not just doing
[00:28:25] the you know the reader you know help on chapter one with the Marine Corps raiders but I'm going to
[00:28:30] help I'm going to be helping the reader when it gets to the army rangers and everything else like
[00:28:34] it has to tie back and each of these chapters have to tie back and to the seal teams it had to be
[00:28:39] relevant to you know how the Navy had you know created this first yeah well there's why we have the
[00:28:45] clunky that's why you have the big long big long title for your chapters and you you're one of
[00:28:50] these guys that pulls off like hey if I'm just really nice maybe juggle will leave me alone you're
[00:28:55] like you gave this rooper nice explanation now I kind of feel bad like no that's a good title
[00:29:00] you did good you put me in check all humble and I'm all I got a major I'll just go I'll leave you
[00:29:05] so uh Marine Corps let's talk about this chapter I know one of the guys that you mentioned to me
[00:29:15] as a guy named Pete Ellis Pete Ellis he didn't make the cut huh no I thought Pete Ellis
[00:29:23] of Pete Ellis is relevant because Pete Ellis is the he's the Marine he's a first world war
[00:29:28] Marine who is he's the first Marine to articulate a vision for the Marine Corps that is more than just a
[00:29:37] subordinate service to the US Navy or the Navy's police force he imagines after he sees what the
[00:29:42] Marine Corps capable of on the Western Front the Marine Corps is the when World War I starts
[00:29:49] and the US military finds itself in the trenches not just in the trenches but then moving on the
[00:29:55] German Army the best force that the United States military has is the Marine Corps so there's all these
[00:30:02] marine officers staff officers, Marine commanders who suddenly by comparison with their peers in the
[00:30:08] US Army see that the Marine Corps is the best service the most capable service you know that we have
[00:30:15] so why not you know start thinking beyond you know just this idea of being you know the ship or
[00:30:22] the ship born utility force for the US Navy why not start thinking of the US Marine Corps as
[00:30:27] almost a rival to the US Army so in order to do that in order to justify that in Congress
[00:30:34] the Marine Corps had to articulate a mission for itself and that mission was you know it was essentially
[00:30:40] come up with by Pete Ellis Pete Ellis he identifies the enemy or at least you know he's writing this in
[00:30:46] 1922 20 years before World War II starts he knows that the next war the US is in is going to be
[00:30:54] with Imperial Japan he knows how rapacious Japan is he knows their ambitions to dominate all of Asia
[00:31:01] and if the US military wants to confront Japan it's going to have to have a force capable of doing that
[00:31:07] a force that's not just you know like I said the ship born utility force of Raiders or
[00:31:15] jungle fighters anything like that they're going to have to have all the logistics capable of
[00:31:20] supporting an amphibious army ashore artillery aircraft logistics ships landing craft all that stuff
[00:31:29] so he is the one that comes up with this plan problem with Pete Ellis is he is a personal disaster
[00:31:37] he is nobody that I wrote about is as much of a liberty risk I mean he is
[00:31:43] he suffers from depression something they call niraznia and he whenever he when he's writing this
[00:31:52] plan the advanced base operations for Micronesia when he's writing when he's drafting this plan
[00:31:56] for the Marine Corps he's doing periodic bouts at the mental hospital in Washington DC he
[00:32:05] was eventually what he doing World War I he was a staff officer but I I wasn't completely clear on
[00:32:11] his combat record I got the sense that he actually saw a decent amount of combat he he wrote a plan
[00:32:20] of operations for I can't remember which assault it was I think it was on the blockmonks section
[00:32:24] of the hidden bird line but it was it was supposed it was supposed to be a brilliant operational
[00:32:29] plan and it was it was totally successful and it was I think it was noticed by purging at one point
[00:32:37] it was called one of the best plans in the war but after that you know when he's you know
[00:32:44] during this period of the 20s after one bout in a mental institution he convinces the secretary
[00:32:51] the navy or the undersecretary the navy which is the hero's about junior at the time to send him
[00:32:55] on a like on an island hopping survey of the central pacific so he can justify or so he can prove
[00:33:02] what he suspects which is the Japanese are building all these island readouts throughout the
[00:33:07] center throughout the pacific he gets the authorization by a tenoros of el junior he goes out there
[00:33:15] something happens at one of these island bars he starts announcing his intentions of well he's on a
[00:33:22] bender the spies trying like a collective and going to pack off he managed to it manages to escape
[00:33:32] escapes the island makes his way to another island then drinks himself to death there's a you know
[00:33:38] there's a whole cottage industry of writers out there that you know say that he was poisoned or he was
[00:33:45] killed by the Japanese I think he was just a drunk and he just sliver couldn't handle it
[00:33:50] your train I don't know what the name of the place is but for a while we were using some
[00:33:57] facility and I don't want to name it but you'll know what I'm talking about that was used to be
[00:34:02] an institution like a mental institution you're training that place I was familiar
[00:34:08] and for a while we in the teams were going to some place that was formerly a mental institution
[00:34:13] and it was creepy creepy like you'd go into certain it's in the middle of the country kind of
[00:34:27] man it was weird you'd go into rums and you'd just like look around and there'd be weird
[00:34:34] it was weird it was really weird you know like you get a little bit of scary that's you know
[00:34:41] saying we're you know it's night and you you're with like one other dude you're standing
[00:34:46] some weird hallway and there and it's it looks like it's from 1922 that's what maybe think of it
[00:34:51] like 1922 well you know you start talking about what a mental institution was like in 1922 it's not
[00:34:59] like what it's like now right now it's you know probably they've got nice windows and they want to
[00:35:06] make things safe and open for people to understand and learn and feel good about themselves this was
[00:35:11] not the scenario in this place where I trained at at all man like what like in a asylum yes
[00:35:16] no 100% it was kind of yeah it was like an asylum he thought it was haunted that's what you're
[00:35:20] scared kind of I think it's probably just a file or even think that too I mean when you you see
[00:35:26] like not just you know a silence but there's this been there's been the story of this
[00:35:31] orphanage in Canada you know that had all these indigenous children they're finding just mass
[00:35:37] mass of burial plots now of all these kids that were killed there it's horrific yeah well that was
[00:35:45] uh I'm not an expert on that right yeah well that was that was one of the goals was to just
[00:35:49] reeducate the children see it happening now right now with our school systems kids are getting
[00:35:55] reeducated in a new way speaking of ending up in the silence so uh there's another character
[00:36:06] that's uh yeah a guy named Red Mike yeah I was hoping you'd ask about him you could write a
[00:36:17] book about Red Mike that's uh Red Mike Hudson he's uh so when I was trying to you know sort through the
[00:36:25] the relevance of the Raiders the Raiders are important to the history of the seal teams because
[00:36:30] uh they're the first instance where the navy telegraphs its desire for its own rating force uh they
[00:36:37] want to um broadcast or they want to um franchise raids throughout the Pacific to draw the
[00:36:44] Japanese attention away from the areas that they're about to attack so Japanese defenses are
[00:36:49] too consolidated they want to spread them out on all these islands so uh when before uh the invasion
[00:36:56] of Guadalcanau uh it was the navy's idea to pull the Japanese attention all the way to the central
[00:37:01] Pacific you know 2,000 miles north um so the idea is launch some submarine raiders on these things
[00:37:11] and uh you know like I said spread the spread Japanese attention spread Japanese defenses
[00:37:17] and I was looking when I knew that you know I knew that that's that was the goal and there were
[00:37:21] two uh Raider battalions that do it or that there were designed to do it the first Raider battalion
[00:37:25] and the second Raider battalion now I knew the second Raider battalion had taken making and that
[00:37:30] was probably more in keeping with uh the the point that I needed to make uh to launch pad into
[00:37:36] my second chapter what I didn't like was that I would have to spend so much time with Evans Carlson
[00:37:41] now if you read the book Evans Carlson is one of probably the three most peculiar characters in the
[00:37:48] book uh he's really frustrating um and you know you you if you're writing history you know the
[00:37:54] goal is always to be objective with characters you don't want to telegraph to your reader that you
[00:37:58] don't like somebody uh Evans Carlson is a as a person it's hard not to dislike merit uh red mic
[00:38:06] heads in on the other hand is uh he's incredible like you I mean he's um I mean uh he he was incredible
[00:38:17] before the war in Nicaragua he he he he he fought he fought through all these little banana wars
[00:38:21] like I know that the Marine Corps has this love affair with uh chesty polar um there's no reason
[00:38:28] that uh they should have any less affinity for red mic heads and he's everywhere uh during World War
[00:38:36] II um lead some of the most daring um assaults of the war he's at uh to la guadal canal he's at
[00:38:43] tarawai I mean three major uh uh battles in Marine Corps history he's got a I think he had two navy
[00:38:51] crosses a metal on her silver stars I mean he was he was incredible um and he's got a terribly
[00:38:58] tragic end he um it's bizarre it is bizarre did you read about him he yeah he uh he he he leaves the
[00:39:07] navy he leaves the Marine Corps uh under protest when uh during the other revolt of the
[00:39:12] animals uh after World War II right before the Korean War um when the army and the air force kind of
[00:39:18] collaborated to uh strip the navy in the Marine Corps of funding uh he resigns the Marine Corps
[00:39:23] and protests so he can uh protest more loudly um he has a series of jobs and eventually he
[00:39:31] commit suicide and his garage he um I don't know I mean I that's one of those you don't hear a lot
[00:39:37] of uh World War II veterans that uh that the the made that decision um uh I mean it stands to the
[00:39:45] reason you know considering everything that we're going through right now I mean someone who has gone
[00:39:50] through as much as you know red mic Edson did had suffered as many blast injuries as he no doubt
[00:39:56] you know suffered um I think he was probably dealing with all the same uh same things that
[00:40:01] so many of our friends are yeah so yeah I think that idea of resigning in protest and what you get
[00:40:10] from it where where it ends up is a tough thing to talk about because once you're done yeah you're
[00:40:17] done you're done and actually um I think it was a green during the Vietnam War addressed it
[00:40:23] who he was like the common on the Marine Corps I can't I forgive my memory but you know he was
[00:40:29] getting interviewed well why did you you know leave because you got Mac Mara who's a jackass you
[00:40:33] got LBJ who's a total jackass maybe it's time just to you know make your statement hey I
[00:40:38] and he said look I'll be in the news for for 48 hours and then that's it that'll have another guy
[00:40:42] and I'll have no influence and that's you know I've often talked about hack or through in the same
[00:40:47] thing Vietnam you know he could have been a division he could have been a brigade commander could have been
[00:40:51] a division commander would have had whatever thousands of troops underneath him that he could have
[00:40:55] fought in a different way but instead he sort of resigned in protest and and yeah you know there's
[00:41:03] there's another um the commanding officer of uh I want to say the hospitality in World War I but
[00:41:13] he was a metal of honor recipient and he killed himself after the he was one of the Paul Bears
[00:41:22] at the tune for the tune of the unknown soldier and you know that happened I want to say like
[00:41:30] 1919 was when they actually had everything set up for the to dedicate the tune with the unknown
[00:41:35] soldier he was has a metal of honor recipient he was one of the guys that um that was one of those
[00:41:43] Paul Bears and then I think it was about a year later he booked a uh C passage from New York to
[00:41:52] Cubar's New York to Florida or something and then wrote a note and disappeared you know killed
[00:41:57] himself did you read that Patrick go down all the what is it called I can't remember what it
[00:42:04] what it's called I was just one that I had seen it was it looked interesting what's it about
[00:42:09] it's about the tune of the unknown soldier okay no I did not read it I'll be curious to read it it's
[00:42:14] about I think it's about all all the Paul Bears in that uh oh wow there's a problem
[00:42:23] and it will a little bit what what was it that you didn't like about Carlson so much Carlson
[00:42:30] he's just man Carlson is um Carlson there were lots of characters that I came in contact with
[00:42:46] then are other Carlson's their characters that you you know they've they've done and they've done
[00:42:55] an incredible amount for their country and but you can you have the benefit of hindsight you have
[00:43:02] the benefit of perspective and you have to um you have to weigh in on their legacy so
[00:43:09] Carlson done more than me yeah Carlson done more than you I mean he's he's he's he's
[00:43:15] lost through world or two I can't me he's he's not even close like yeah there's nothing we can't
[00:43:21] compare you know our contribution to somebody like Carlson he's he's he's in the first one of the
[00:43:29] first raids of the entire war and then he fights in successive battles the what's important about Carlson
[00:43:36] though is that the Marine Corps um loses all respect for him after the making island raid
[00:43:42] they give him another chance with the long patrol on Guadalcanal and he does admirable work there
[00:43:46] but it's not enough to overshadow uh the the defeat and the uh the aftermath of the making island raid
[00:43:54] the making island raid um it is really known how uh disaster disaster it is until 1943 a whole year
[00:44:02] later when uh U.S. forces retake the island and they discover that the um that the Marines that
[00:44:10] uh they believe to have been drowned uh in the uh evacuation weren't drowned but captured and killed
[00:44:16] it'd be headed by the Japanese um so it's sort of a uh sort of a uh a failure that kind of unfolds over time
[00:44:24] but when the the full scope of the failure the making island raid is understood um the Marine
[00:44:30] Corps never lets Evans Carlson command troops ever again now that's perfectly you know find for
[00:44:36] the Marine Corps leadership they was there something about his personality that is a personality yeah
[00:44:42] but it's also as politics he was uh I think he was a borderline uh communist he was definitely a
[00:44:47] populist um definitely like a uh a socialist populist um but he was um um by the end of the war uh
[00:44:56] he's advocating for the Chinese uh the not the national's Chinese the kind of the Chinese communist
[00:45:03] eventually he he dies and disgrace penniless because he uh he he he he he resigned from the Marine Corps
[00:45:10] well I can't remember exactly what happens to him in the aftermath but I know he has no money
[00:45:15] and Teddy Roosevelt has to pay for his funeral not Teddy Roosevelt um James Roosevelt
[00:45:21] but uh some of it's his personality some of it just he's got he's kind of ponderous
[00:45:25] like uh he's been boring like you know stuffy like uh one of the the things that I think is most
[00:45:31] telling the most descriptive uh episode I have a little vignette and the book is one one of his junior
[00:45:37] officers comes up to him and asks him for you know a few books uh to read uh that will help him
[00:45:42] understand you know the you know how to command or the military art better and and all the books
[00:45:49] the Carlson recommends are books that he's written they you gotta think a lot of yourself
[00:45:56] to tell somebody you know if they're looking for books to read these five that have written so
[00:46:01] he tried to read them and they're all in penetrable boring books of the Chinese like he gave up
[00:46:07] well I'm very thankful right now for the book about face by Colonel David Hachworth
[00:46:11] because when ever somebody says hey what we know what's a good book for me to read about leadership
[00:46:15] and I have said oh yeah I read about face because otherwise I'd be pulling their Carlson
[00:46:18] and telling the leading stream owners of leadership strategy and tactics I'm a loser
[00:46:24] now you don't like me too I'm right up there with Carlson I didn't say well if it wasn't for
[00:46:28] hackworth I'd be right up there with Carlson oh and hang on you haven't seen the books that Carlson
[00:46:33] wrote true I had to read them oh and they just nasty they're just boring do you remember any titles of them
[00:46:40] did you read the whole thing or you like this is ridiculous I get the idea you know since
[00:46:44] a dork in the beginning I did and the beginning I had everything collected I read books that I
[00:46:49] knew that Carlson had read just because I wanted to think like he was thinking he was fascinated
[00:46:55] with Mao so I was reading Mao when he when I was writing this chapter so I got better with my
[00:47:01] research as I went on but at the time like when I wrote chapter one I had not yet stepped into an
[00:47:08] article I wrote the first draft of chapter one just based off of out of books that existed from
[00:47:15] online archives I was able to find a ton of material online on the make and island raid so there
[00:47:20] I mean you pay you know 20 bucks a month you have access to fold three and a couple of other archives
[00:47:26] and you can find the after action report of the USS not all of us or the USS are arguing on
[00:47:31] so you know not having stepped into an archive I was taking advantage of everything else that
[00:47:38] was available to me all the books that Carlson written books that Mao had written you know things
[00:47:43] things like that so I was I was saturated with all this stuff is sort of extraneous as I got
[00:47:47] better you know in my research so chapter two is the first time I stepped foot into an archive and I was like
[00:47:52] oh I can do this better all right well let's get the chapter two chapter two which is called
[00:48:04] the sidelining of the armies and phibia soldier scouts and the call-up of the navy second string sailors
[00:48:12] I think that's pretty good. It's pretty good. Pretty good. All right for the second string sailors that's a nod to
[00:48:17] you know these guys all of these second string sailors were all members every single one of the
[00:48:24] initial navy contingent of the scouts and raider program are all NFL veterans they've all been
[00:48:33] Bucklew he's not only a not only was it college football star not only an NFL star but he was
[00:48:41] uh he was building his own team right he he he founded the Columbus bullies and it would have
[00:48:49] probably been a a successful NFL franchise had it not been for the start of World War II that is a
[00:48:56] freaking legit name to Columbus bullies yeah man if I would have notes if I would have known that
[00:49:04] tasking a bruiser might have been tasking a bullies I guess doesn't quite work quite as well does it
[00:49:10] you know seems kind of sinister yeah but today's I guess I guess especially in today's climate
[00:49:16] you'd be like politically incorrect to call yourself the bullies. I'm a bully. He looked like a bully.
[00:49:23] Do you see pictures of there I mean I went through you know like piles of pictures of Bucklew
[00:49:29] and you know every every picture especially in those World War II days he just looks like a
[00:49:34] like a dick he's like it looks like but that's completely opposite of what everybody I talked to said
[00:49:41] of actually said help you right he said they they all described him as the nicest guy like he was he was
[00:49:47] just so much fun to be around uh was super humble um but yeah every picture he managed it's like you know
[00:49:55] go from what I assume is a you know pretty loving guy and two you know has this big scale in his face
[00:50:00] and so what I meant to go down the spaffee little bit of Carlson so Carlson's personality
[00:50:06] what was he a dick was he an arrogant guy no he was he was uh how do you end up on these
[00:50:12] failing missions was it a lack of experience I think it was it was a couple of things he um he was
[00:50:19] infatuated with the Chinese and the Chinese operational system he was the the the the the the the
[00:50:24] Marine Corps are the the slogan the Marine Corps slogan of Ganghaw came from Carlson he that's his
[00:50:30] love that's his lasting legacy to the Marine Corps we understand Ganghaw to me an expression that
[00:50:36] it you know epitomizes you know Marine Corps tenacity in Marine Corps what he what he
[00:50:42] re-consured the machine gun that's yeah it means uh but what up and what it really means
[00:50:47] work together right it's the Chinese expressions of a very I'm not sure if it's even accurate but
[00:50:52] he took it from his time on the long march with Mao's guerrillas yeah it means work together
[00:51:00] but I'll say what when we pick apart uh some of Mao's work on the podcast the thing that's crazy
[00:51:05] about Mao's work is it's basically it's essentially he's saying you need to utilize decentralized
[00:51:10] command to win in military operations and I'm like hey bro Mao you that applies to everything dude
[00:51:17] like you can't have decentralized organization in order to win a war and then centralized your
[00:51:24] government as soon as you're done and think that you can explain how many you know what what
[00:51:28] every farmer in the in the country's supposed to grow and how much we're gonna sell whatever
[00:51:31] we're gonna sell it for like it's crazy that they came to that conclusion I don't understand you
[00:51:35] know there's so many contradictions like that in Molder 2 I mean how are the Germans who are the
[00:51:40] most you know higher archical government system you know on the planet and they managed to produce
[00:51:45] a military they was able to use initiative decentralized command yet at the top they're stultified
[00:51:50] they they don't they can't accomplish anything I mean they can't you know release the panzers
[00:51:55] and d-day like I mean there but yeah at the lower level there you know able to do you know
[00:52:00] able to be dynamic and fluid and agile and all the rest you know what you're when your ego starts
[00:52:04] to get out of control you start to think I better control everything that's what happens
[00:52:09] and you could see I mean it seemed like Hitler did that throughout World War II the more he won
[00:52:14] the more he thought why better control everything see it's working I better just keep doing this and
[00:52:17] by the end it was all on him hey we're gonna we're gonna attack Russia even those generals
[00:52:21] were saying hey bro not a good idea no we're doing it yeah the Carlson the the other thing
[00:52:27] that Carlson did was he was he was so in fact he was the Chinese system that he was
[00:52:32] he would eat with his men he would have these like town hall discussions he would
[00:52:36] he essentially abolished rank except for like in certain aspects he but when he got on the
[00:52:46] I mean when he was you know on the actual make in island raid you can see a clear
[00:52:53] misunderstanding of what the mission was which told me I mean you're that is conveying to you
[00:53:00] he doesn't know what his mission objective is he hasn't thought through he spent two weeks
[00:53:04] sitting on a submarine you know driving across the Pacific under you know completely miserable
[00:53:10] conditions you know sweating you know through his you know yeah like and he finally gets there
[00:53:16] I was on modern day self that had a sea and there are super clean and we're not worried about
[00:53:21] getting depth charges drop them your freaking head imagine it till we transit I can't
[00:53:27] go to a few all up in there and he gets there they get on the island and they look around
[00:53:34] and there's you know there's nothing really to raid I mean just the fact that they landed there
[00:53:39] the fact that they were able to assault the Japanese position and win mission accomplished
[00:53:45] get off the island there's nothing else that you have to do here there's no intelligence that
[00:53:49] you're really gonna gather but he he just he's paralyzed which just you know like I said it conveys
[00:53:54] that he doesn't know what he's doing he doesn't really know what the the purpose of this mission is he
[00:53:59] hasn't connected you know the navy's planners vision you know to their actions on on that island
[00:54:07] and then you're comparing that to Bucklew who was like a good guy a nice guy even though he looked like a
[00:54:14] bully so what you wait what you said this is when you started going into the archives for the
[00:54:20] first time was chapter two chapter two yeah so I couldn't spend enough freaking time invested
[00:54:25] in in research just on just on online reading Carlson's books so you wanted more you're a glutton
[00:54:33] I don't know I mean if I had known so there were two things that I got from chapter one writing
[00:54:38] that I was like I was encouraged because I felt like I was a good researcher I'd put you know
[00:54:45] a compelling chapter together were you a sniper no I was a calm guy in a breacher Jay attack type
[00:54:55] yeah I was a calm guy too but I'm just thinking from a patience perspective yeah I'm really
[00:55:01] antsy it's I find my yeah I I don't know what the the disconnect is because I find myself like
[00:55:06] whenever whenever I'm being instructed now or like I'm I find myself like I get real like I can't
[00:55:12] listen to this guy I gotta get out of here I'll find myself just leaving I would have thought
[00:55:16] you would have gone down the sniper because you have this you know super anyone that's you know
[00:55:20] going into archives and reading Carlson's third book on whatever communist leadership from 1932
[00:55:29] now I didn't want to read it though like I remember looking at that book and just kind of like
[00:55:33] hanging my head like I got to read another one of these things I don't know what I don't know why
[00:55:38] I was compelled to do it I was though and I wanted I just wanted to get it right I wanted to I wanted
[00:55:42] to have a good idea of who this guy was and I also didn't have the benefit of reading Carlson's
[00:55:48] you know letters like I did with other people you know say like a bucklue or how is that
[00:55:52] because Carlson didn't have letters no he has I just didn't go to the archive so now that's the
[00:55:56] archives yes I know you start to find real I'm finding real documents I'm finding like I'm
[00:56:01] getting I know bucklue I know how important because I'm I'm reading their letters I'm reading like
[00:56:05] I'm reading you know the letters of the the the folks that you know created the scouts and
[00:56:11] raiders like pedicord and you know not just you know reading their letters but I'm talking
[00:56:16] to family members talking to people that actually knew them I'm getting a real sense of who they
[00:56:20] are you completely changed how I researched but it it also told me one thing I was not going to
[00:56:25] be able to you know write this book from my basement which is terrifying I was going to have to go
[00:56:30] place as I was going to have to you know hunt for stuff and it was terrifying in the beginning
[00:56:34] and talk to people talk to people the worst you know that that did become like you know the one nice
[00:56:41] thing about you know writing a book about world war two is you don't have anybody arguing with
[00:56:48] what you're going to write about you know they don't exit the rock because I'm around anymore
[00:56:52] yeah when you get to Vietnam I'll tell you I'll tell you a story later in the podcast there's
[00:56:58] people who are still alive that I wrote about the dough like what it was written about the
[00:57:02] couch but you know you you insulate yourself from you know the criticism by your due diligence you
[00:57:09] make sure that you get it right if you don't shame on you but in chapter do you have to retract
[00:57:15] anything no there's nothing that I retracted nothing there's nothing that I would I've
[00:57:19] communicated with with folks you know after um and the one case he the the person I wrote about he
[00:57:31] had just passed away his family read about what I wrote about them it's nothing you know
[00:57:37] particularly damning or anything like that but they weren't they weren't thrilled to hear that
[00:57:43] they're dad had you know not completely succeeded in Vietnam and had kind of run off with a nurse
[00:57:51] in second so what I said to them is you know they they were I think the the note that they sent me
[00:58:00] said you know we were disappointed to learn about you know what you perceive as our dad's failure
[00:58:05] and Vietnam I responded I don't think your dad was a failure absolutely not he prepared
[00:58:09] seal team one for war he failed in this one narrow narrow context and that context being
[00:58:18] did he advance or did he advance the naval special warfare toward you know what they ultimately
[00:58:24] became land focus commander Raiders and and that context no he didn't and another he did he was
[00:58:29] success but you know I I told him I you know even though he failed in that you know
[00:58:41] particular moment every lots of people were failing in that particular moment nobody really understood
[00:58:46] what you know what they were getting their hands into yeah it's really easy to look back
[00:58:50] with hindsight absolutely I would though obviously we should have done this instead of that it's like
[00:58:54] very easy look back and say that you know right and so I ultimately told him I was like I'm
[00:59:00] I'm proud to call him my teammate I mean I I look at his legacy and you know I I see you know
[00:59:06] mistakes that I made like I'm not perfect either nobody is so anyway so so we get the second string
[00:59:13] sailors these are the tuna fish right yeah these are the tuna fish whoa these are all guys that
[00:59:19] have gotten kind of roped into the US Navy kind of accidently like Bucklew he joins the Navy
[00:59:26] because the army and the Marine Corps won't take them because he's a human Gus I mean he's too big
[00:59:30] he tries to volunteer for the paratroopers he's too big yeah and the the quote from from his oral
[00:59:38] history is that the recruiter told him that the the army could take two instead of based on just his
[00:59:43] weight but it's completely accurate and Bucklew isn't even the biggest one big John Trips and when you
[00:59:50] see pictures of Bucklew and Trips and next to each other Trips and is a head taller than Bucklew
[00:59:54] how tall do you think Trips and was I have a six seven probably I mean he's massive he's a
[00:59:58] mountain of a man she's six seven and he's just big yeah we had this conversation over the last
[01:00:06] podcast because imagine being six seven like 260 270 in 1940 right I mean no one's even lifting
[01:00:15] bro no no these guys are just jacked through nature through football they're playing a lot of
[01:00:20] football like and Halpern who I wrote about he's the smallest one Halpern was the you know he's the
[01:00:27] Jewish guy that you know went to play for Notre Dame and I think he was like six two two twenty five
[01:00:33] something like that and he's the smallest of the smallest of the tune of the story yes well these guys
[01:00:38] end up in the navy which and they're thinking hey we're gonna figure something out because we're
[01:00:45] jacked we're physical we're kind of beasts yeah they they pull them in to be like calisthenics yeah
[01:00:50] yeah I'm sorry that's what they get pulled they think that that's what they're gonna do they think
[01:00:53] they're you know joining to go you know do this like you know whatever commando program and they get
[01:00:58] you know roped into you know Jean Toney you know Jean Toney is you know he's a famous character
[01:01:04] himself he's the he's the two time boxing champion he beat helped me out Joe was no not Joe was
[01:01:17] this is terrible because I wrote I wrote two whole pages about Toney's fight in Philadelphia
[01:01:23] uh with um I can't think of it I know that I know that you wrote about the fact that he'd like
[01:01:30] trained he was the first person that trained yeah he's the hard guy that like that that that was going
[01:01:36] through physical training in order to get good and he was able to he only fought like three times though
[01:01:44] and two of those were championship fights jacked MC that's right so all right so now we got these guys
[01:01:52] so yeah so they they're in uh Jean Toney's regime of physical fitness instructors they're kind
[01:01:58] of getting uh they're taking navy recruits they're they're they're training them they're putting them through
[01:02:04] you know little little PT sessions like uh they're they're doing log PT's they're doing like
[01:02:10] little like group activities they stuff that you know uh either Jean Toney had pulled from the
[01:02:15] Marine Corps or uh that they had kind of uh developed along the way themselves which you know that's
[01:02:22] kind of plant a seed for later when you know the scouts and raiders uh uh conditioning curriculum
[01:02:28] gets compressed by driver coffin uh but they all volunteer for this uh this commando program they
[01:02:35] don't really know what it is uh but then they get hoodwinked again from you know Toney's regime
[01:02:40] uh to being landing craft skippers for army commandos you know the the raider uh section of the
[01:02:46] scouts and raider program um that would piss me off so uh wouldn't it oh man they find themselves
[01:02:52] out there and they're like all right you guys are gonna be in charge of the boats
[01:02:57] I would be angry what's the character you got some guy named Weats Leban
[01:03:02] oh somebody that you caught you were taught me about his guy what's his guy uh of its lathe
[01:03:07] and so when I wrote the uh initial draft of this chapter the the thing that I felt like I had to
[01:03:13] convey was that uh uh the senior commanders in World War II they had uh they had a serious problem
[01:03:22] uh when it came to uh amphibious warfare one they didn't have landing craft uh but two
[01:03:28] even if they did have landing craft they didn't know uh the army's commanders they didn't
[01:03:33] know how to put troops ashore and there were uh there were logistics problems they they knew
[01:03:38] that they would need to even if they uh were able to land um men even if they were able to put
[01:03:44] landing craft on beaches uh they needed to put um men on beaches and which there were beach
[01:03:50] exits so exits so you could drive vehicles off the beach I mean if you land on a beach that has
[01:03:56] you know cliff faces and you can't drive off the beach then uh what good is it that you you know
[01:04:01] had all these landing craft you have to have uh guys that can find beaches good beaches uh and then
[01:04:09] alert the army out to where those beaches are so you know can bring an entire landing force
[01:04:15] ashore the army has completely um in the interwar period from World War I to World War II they've
[01:04:22] done almost nothing uh when it comes to the development of amphibious doctrine nothing showcased
[01:04:27] uh the threat of all of that more uh then uh the terrible disaster at D.A.P which happens in
[01:04:35] August of 1942 that's the first time uh the allies attempt to land um troops on an enemy beach
[01:04:43] or a Nazi controlled enemy beach now the proponents of troops in the battle are Canadians there's a
[01:04:49] decent amount of British commandos uh there's a handful of American army rainders um they go ashore
[01:04:56] uh most of the Canadians are killed or captured um and part of the reason that uh this raid or
[01:05:02] this assault or this attempted you know uh address rehearsal of D.A. fails is because they don't have
[01:05:08] a good assessment of um what the beach eggs it's were like they don't know how uh when they got
[01:05:14] ashore the tanks either um they weren't able to get off the beach because the sand was too uh
[01:05:20] too loose they couldn't their their their treads um buried up to the hubs they couldn't get out
[01:05:24] they couldn't get off the beach the tanks that or the tanks and the vehicles that were able
[01:05:27] to get off the beach they ran into tank traps almost immediately so um um the idea was you know
[01:05:34] creating you know writing this whole chapter on you know the deep raid was just you know uh
[01:05:39] away from you to talk about uh you know all the imperatives that a uh a scouting radar force would need to
[01:05:46] um um solve yeah bring to bring to the table yeah you for the for the for the mission right
[01:05:53] you needed to find a beach you know that you could land on you know the sand is dense enough uh
[01:05:58] that had beach exits uh and that you could you know signal the rest of the fleet for
[01:06:04] cut it all gone all of it's gone what's if it's labin was one of those characters he was
[01:06:08] one of the architects of uh you know Hitler's initial push to fortify um the the Atlantic wall uh
[01:06:17] I don't know why but that's labin on my nose but he was he was a character that I got sucked into
[01:06:21] because he was one of those guys that he hated Hitler uh and yet he still did everything he could
[01:06:26] to you know fortify the coast he was ultimately one of those guys that uh participated in the
[01:06:32] July 20th plot to kill Hitler and he ended up uh getting executed by dang from a meat hook um
[01:06:38] anyway that's a little bit of a rabbit hole isn't it every one of these freaking characters is like
[01:06:47] I know it's a lot I mean it's a lot but you know all these things are just you know they're
[01:06:52] there yeah what what's the what's the problem with buckloom the problem with buckloom is everywhere
[01:06:58] meaning what he's too he's moving around too much now trying to do too much what no no no he like the
[01:07:03] the the the buckloom presents a problem presented a problem for uh for a writer not for anybody
[01:07:09] else buckloom uh uh and I uh I wrote you know sections about buckloom and chapter two I wrote
[01:07:16] sections about buckloom and chapter four sections about buckloom and chapter six I mean a whole
[01:07:22] chapter about him on uh in the buckloom report and then again he he comes on the stage in uh
[01:07:29] in my chapters on Vietnam when he's the commander of naval operational support group he's everywhere he
[01:07:34] is the indispensable person in uh the history of naval special warfare what was uh the the problem
[01:07:41] that I ran into is that if I had talked about him a little bit here and I talked about him a little
[01:07:47] bit here and then a little bit there I was kind of wasting ammo on him I was going to letter I was
[01:07:51] going to you know I was going to force a reader to kind of discover uh buckloom's relevance you know
[01:08:00] instead of like compressing buckloom into that final uh chapter and you know on the buckloom report
[01:08:06] and really you know instead of you know spreading spreading out your tanks you know consoling
[01:08:10] into one punch so the reader finally gets a sense of how important this person is I just didn't
[01:08:16] want to waste buckloom you know throughout the book I wanted to you know collect him all one
[01:08:21] thing but it took me you know almost until the book was entirely written and then I had to go
[01:08:25] back through the book and I cut buckloom cut buckloom so I could you know yeah because otherwise you're
[01:08:31] kind of giving away the story because buckloom doesn't become but you know he wasn't buckloom out
[01:08:36] of the gate I mean he was a stud sure it was awesome wasn't like Phil H buckloom right which is what
[01:08:42] the where seal training takes place is called the Phil H buckloom Center for Naval Special Warfare
[01:08:46] right our schoolhouse is named after this guy but he didn't come out of the gate that way
[01:08:51] came out of the gate as a guy and he never kind of shines in the way that other characters did so
[01:08:57] I was always frustrated because I knew that I had to talk about buckloom and I knew the buck
[01:09:00] was so important but he never you know he's not the first guy I sure like how important is he's not
[01:09:07] he's not the the ground force commander in China like how important is um but he's there he's always
[01:09:13] there like all the you know like some some other characters too so but I just didn't want to lose the
[01:09:18] was he was he younger is that why he was still around when Vietnam gets comes in the play they were
[01:09:24] all about the same age I think he was younger than helping help him was the old man of the group
[01:09:28] helping was 34 I think he used 34 when he enlisted as a semen right helping us and he was a
[01:09:35] Notre Dame graduate and NFL player and all those other crazy stuff NFL player he was running his
[01:09:40] dad's commercial light company in Chicago it was developing a clothing store I mean he was kind of like
[01:09:44] kind of the jacco like he kind of you know a lot going on and he just enlisted as a semen he was married
[01:09:50] like and he and he and he was a professional you know sailboat racer he was a competitive sailboat racer
[01:09:55] on like Michigan I don't know if you remember in the in his epitaph but I write in the book he was
[01:10:01] Halpern was he was in the 1960s Olympics for sailing a lot of bronze metal what a freaking stud yeah he's
[01:10:08] incredible and he was 34 when he had swim a semen old the 1960s he's old and the pictures of him
[01:10:16] like he was 60 years old in the Olympics he's the oldest man there was competing at that time
[01:10:22] but by then Halpern has developed I mean Halpern is you know he's more than he's got his friends
[01:10:28] with his friends with Samatra he knows everybody like he's running you know he founded LL being
[01:10:35] like he's by that point in his life I mean he's wait Buck Halpern founded LL being
[01:10:40] yeah explain that to be a little bit that's as much as I know I know he was one of the
[01:10:45] found finally I got to the end of when you rabbit holes you were you didn't have the freaking
[01:10:48] iron vault to dig in won't you tell me well maybe if you know if it wasn't for the fact that I have
[01:10:54] a factory up in Maine where we produce stuff near LL being maybe that's a little bit of a
[01:10:59] important deal we could have known a lot more about the frogman history and LL being well
[01:11:02] I'll give him some props I'll get to the bottom of that before I think he sold his shares
[01:11:09] but Buck Buck Lou and he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't quite you know outshine you know
[01:11:13] Halpern and or other other guys and all these other episodes so but he does you know like he finally
[01:11:19] takes center stage you know during the Buckley report and his whole biography is compressed into that
[01:11:25] into that report but that's getting ahead of the story all right we roll into chapter three and this was
[01:11:32] um I mean it's a rough one to read I was listening to and and re-reading and I was listening to the
[01:11:40] podcast we did on it man this is a freaking hard one to read because it's um well the name of the
[01:11:46] chapters the US Army's first commandos and the raid that wasn't so this is not a bad this one of
[01:11:52] your more abbreviated titles so so we give you credit for that uh I don't want your laughing
[01:11:59] well you know echo has no doesn't even say anything I try and keep this I try and keep it tight
[01:12:06] that's not even talking so once I mentioned it I can't unsee it like oh we shouldn't warm up it
[01:12:14] I told you he's going off here it's kind of like when Phil Vaughn said you look to you halfway
[01:12:18] through the podcast and says like what about you your name is echo you haven't said anything yet
[01:12:22] okay for echo you sure don't see much yeah there you go well's a good observant
[01:12:31] situation this was a rough one because well I guess because of because of what happened with the
[01:12:38] Rangers right in the beginning what was what was it like right in this chapter um this is a
[01:12:45] this was the fifth chapter I wrote so I felt like I was I was further along I was better
[01:12:52] uh than um I was with some of the earlier chapters I don't I I don't know if that accounts for
[01:12:57] you know why I think the the chapter has such a great arc to it but I or it's just because the
[01:13:03] you know the history itself has such you know such a tragic arc um it was hard to write this in the
[01:13:12] the sense that I was I always assumed that I'd be rooting for the navy like throughout the book
[01:13:19] rooting for you know the the navy chapters and then I'd get to an army or marine court chapter and
[01:13:24] I'd be like see I told you so like I know you know I knew that you guys were going to you know
[01:13:29] screw up and there'd be an opportunity for the navy I found the opposite to be true or not
[01:13:32] maybe not the opposite but I found myself you know just you know empathizing with these guys
[01:13:41] so much like there were I mean this the Ranger contribution um in World War II is
[01:13:51] it's remarkable the contribution of guys like Darby remarkable I mean and to have to write about
[01:14:00] Darby critically um that wasn't easy to do I had the um it was the first time that I had to
[01:14:09] write about somebody who you know I knew to be you know a legitimate American hero um and
[01:14:15] write about them you know in a you know an a light that's not flattering and I'm not sure
[01:14:19] that anybody's ever done that before I'd read a lot of books about Darby and every single one of
[01:14:23] them they you know has they burnish as legacy they they consider him you know to be one of the
[01:14:30] the the founders are one of the the the most important you know greatest
[01:14:36] um contributors to American special operation history and that's true but there's also this other truth
[01:14:43] that Darby should have known better and he didn't um and I don't know why I mean I thought
[01:14:49] I spent a lot of time thinking about it like nobody in the US Army knew better than Darby
[01:14:56] what a raid was and how a raid could be successful and what elements would have to be put together
[01:15:03] for that raid to fail and that raid I mean there's so many you know kind of warning bells about
[01:15:10] the raid on the stern of the should have alerted Darby and the rest of the chain of command that
[01:15:14] this was this was a disaster waiting to happen and yet you know nobody threw the brakes on
[01:15:19] this is one of the ones where you do a little psychological kind of profiling of Darby
[01:15:24] I actually want wanted to read this section part of it I read on the last one but it's worth reading again
[01:15:29] um because part of it I didn't read on the last one black hair blue-eyed wide mouth as a duck
[01:15:35] Darby had a ruddy face divided into equal parts forehead and chin
[01:15:42] his left cheek borham mysterious brilliant red scar not particularly muscular he nevertheless
[01:15:48] affected chest out shoulders back posture in which his arms always seemed cocked to the rear as if
[01:15:55] never more than a moment away from snapping to attention son of a printer in a musician
[01:15:59] the second child between two sisters he grew up scouting the Arkansas woods and playing the
[01:16:05] saxophone when in high school his older sister died in Texas he married then divorced in spite of
[01:16:10] disappointment and tragedy his attitude remained just as ever been good humor and irresponsible
[01:16:16] or sorry in irrepressible in personality just like in posture he was direct forceful and never
[01:16:21] vacillating had the military gene not dominated and driven him to a life of soldiering he would have been
[01:16:28] been a salesman he is the ideal commando leader wrote Colonel Vaughan at the end of the course
[01:16:36] he possesses the energy keenness and personality which produces the best out of those under his command
[01:16:43] graduated from west point in 1933 at the apex of the bell curve ranked 177 out of a class of
[01:16:49] 346 he was originally assigned as a field artillery officer like all soldiers who graduated then
[01:16:56] and with that assignment he embarked on an eight-year career punctuated by the peace time artillery
[01:17:01] corps's elements boredom and horse manure the 1941 he was one of the few soldiers who attended the
[01:17:07] joint army marine corps amphibious exercises in Puerto Rico disappointed at not snagging a combat command
[01:17:14] in the wake of the pearl harbour attacks in mid-January 1942 he was made assistant to major general
[01:17:20] Russell P. Hardle commander of the 34th infantry and assigned to northern island the staging
[01:17:27] area for a theater of operation still two years in the future anxious to get into the war when
[01:17:32] assigned to escort general trust got on his base tour and Ranger recruitment drive Darby made the most of it
[01:17:39] trust got duly rewarded Darby's professionalism and interest with an offer to command the first
[01:17:45] Ranger battalion few offers have been accepted so enthusiastically at first glance Darby's
[01:17:51] Rangers viewed him as a pencil pushing a decamp and why not he was after all little more than a
[01:17:58] peace time artillery officer not even an infantryman this perception died a quick death
[01:18:05] throughout their training Darby slung a standard M1 overs shoulder and rotated between companies
[01:18:12] marching climbing shooting doing whatever the men were doing and doing it better after an
[01:18:17] intelligence officer from headquarters brief the Rangers on the allied procedures for surrendering to the
[01:18:23] enemy Darby bristled and took the floor this formation this information you have just heard is
[01:18:28] all very well for those troops who are going to be captured but that is not for Rangers
[01:18:33] if there's any capturing to be done he continued it is the Rangers who will do it within two months
[01:18:41] of training together the men were reverently calling him Eldarbo by the end he would defy comparison
[01:18:48] and army staff officer waiting ashore at Sorrento in 1943 and 1943 would find a man wearing a
[01:18:55] Ranger patch and ask where he might find Darby smirking the Ranger would reply you'll never find him
[01:19:01] this far back if the ideal army officer was equal parts confidence bravery energy and obedience
[01:19:11] Darby was all these things but perhaps too much the last and that that sent and stuck with me
[01:19:20] you know from a leadership perspective of course because it's about balance right and you do
[01:19:26] need to be obedient but at the same time if you're too obedient you're yeah there's a
[01:19:34] you're too obedient right there's a famous quote by one of Frederick the Great's generals
[01:19:40] he says to a young officer the king gave you a commission so you because he assumed what
[01:19:49] that you would know when to break orders and that's all part of initiative I mean that's all like
[01:19:59] if there was one trait that I sort of settled on as being the reason that the
[01:20:06] the Navy seemed to be ahead of the game where at least a ahead of its peers when it came to
[01:20:13] the creation of special operations units it was because the Navy had this culture of latitude
[01:20:18] and this decentralized command and an initiative that enabled subordinates to feel like they had
[01:20:28] the flexibility to make decisions on the fly or adjust to the realities that they were facing
[01:20:35] whereas somebody like Darby is in the US Army and one thing that I wrote is you know the
[01:20:46] chain of command in the US Army has never been it's never been de-linked it's only been
[01:20:55] progressively thick and over time and you see that not just in not just today but you can kind of
[01:21:01] see it happen gradually and I would see it you know a little bit in World War II and I kind of got
[01:21:06] that my first sense of it here reading and writing about the Rangers but I also saw it you know
[01:21:12] in my Korean War chapters and I would come across you know an army general like Edwin Walker who
[01:21:18] he's flying above his troops above his soldiers in a little spotter plane with a bullhorn
[01:21:25] telling individual units which one you know which one to move like I mean in some sense that you know
[01:21:33] that says to you the reader you know what a cool what a cool general that he's you know willing to
[01:21:38] you know put himself out there for the same time like that's also like awful that's taking
[01:21:42] all the initiative away from your guys and you're you know you're you're not only telling them
[01:21:47] where they should advance but you're also telling them that they don't have the authority to
[01:21:51] to retreat either if they need to or to you know gain a tactical advantage by maneuver
[01:21:56] centralized command that it's worse right there absolutely and the last time we we you were
[01:22:02] on we talked about the fact that hey when you're in the navy you know throughout history and you
[01:22:07] know if bends in charge of this ship you're gonna go sail away from me as the Admiral I can't talk
[01:22:13] to anyone like you're you you've got the mission you're gonna do it to the best of your ability
[01:22:17] the other thing that's interesting about this is sometimes the ocean is going to dictate what
[01:22:25] you're going to like it out there are certain times where you cannot you cannot proceed you cannot
[01:22:31] continue the ocean is going to stop you you know you can get some really really extreme examples
[01:22:37] where weather could inhibit you on land from making the type of progress you want to make but you
[01:22:43] right a river swollen right a river swollen but those are extreme examples right the out in the
[01:22:49] ocean that's kind of a regular thing you know there's giant sea states that come through it's it's
[01:22:56] so so you have to have some more ability to adapt because you are look if you're in a sailboat
[01:23:03] the wind's not blowing you're not going anywhere right that's what's happening you can't maneuver
[01:23:09] to the north because the direction of the wind or the direction of the sea state you can't do it's
[01:23:13] not going to happen so you have to have some level of flexibility whereas more so on the ground
[01:23:19] you can power through a lot of weather events and again I'm going back to you know times before
[01:23:26] radios and before before motors where you're just going to make this happen so it seems like yeah
[01:23:34] unfortunately that Darby was a little heavy on the obedience and it's not always a positive thing
[01:23:43] no I mean I'm not just on not just on obedience but on
[01:23:49] on paragatives that's not that's not the right word either but protocol I would say so he gets
[01:23:56] one of the one of the the shocking things that I saw when he was putting the the sister in a
[01:24:03] raid together was he put in charge of the entire assault element a an officer who'd never been
[01:24:09] with the Rangers who would just because he was in the rank yeah just because he he had a date of rank
[01:24:15] you know the proceeded you know the the Rangers that he'd been working with since they'd been
[01:24:22] training together in Scotland these were Rangers that knew what being a Ranger was they these
[01:24:27] guys have been trained by the British Commandos they knew what a raid was they knew the you know
[01:24:32] how a raid would succeed and how it would fail and what then the and instead of you know putting
[01:24:37] one of his you know one of his Rangers that he knew from Scotland in charge he selected the guy
[01:24:43] who'd never been a Ranger not and he's not a bad leader he's an excellent leader and he
[01:24:49] equates himself you know incredibly during the battle but he also doesn't know as as Daylights
[01:24:56] creeping up on these guys and they have a sense of we are in the middle of a German division
[01:25:04] there is we can't do this we can't accomplish this he does not have the confidence to say
[01:25:09] guys we're turning around and so um speaking of British Commandos I know one of the one of the
[01:25:18] people that you had to kind of cut was Mount Baton yeah Lord Lewis Mount Baton this dude is like
[01:25:27] the British of all British right he he is but he's not like the one thing that I thought was
[01:25:34] interesting about Mount Baton is their Germans the Mount Baton family their their Germans his
[01:25:41] his father believe it's his father he becomes the first Lord of the Admiralty but he's born in
[01:25:47] Germany he serves in the German Navy he doesn't emigrate to England or to the United Kingdom until
[01:25:55] he's a bit older and then he rises up through the ranks of the British Navy becomes the first Lord
[01:26:00] but Mount Baton so Prince Philip Prince Philip who just passed away he was a Mount Baton so Lord
[01:26:07] Louis Mount Baton was his uncle yeah so Mount Baton means a fascinating character he's he by the time
[01:26:17] he's put in charge of combined operations headquarters of the the entity that commands all
[01:26:23] British Commandos he's been I think he's been shot out from under two ships or he's had two ships
[01:26:28] that were sunk you know we you that's a second time you've made that statement about hey this
[01:26:36] guy had two ships shot out from under him and it sounds really cool right now right yeah like damn you
[01:26:43] know because we're like you know we think that's kind of cool but I wonder if there's any negative
[01:26:48] where someone's like dude this guy's laws two ships row one's raw with you yeah I wonder I
[01:26:54] don't think about oh he kept getting promoted yeah we had the political connection he's he's really
[01:26:59] young he's really dynamic he's one of the few people that is able to not dominate Churchill but
[01:27:05] he's able to like Churchill thinks he's just I mean he's this cavalier and so he's the one that
[01:27:12] grew up in Germany that's his dad that's his dad yeah so Louis Mount Baton he grows up he's his
[01:27:19] British it's a I don't know he's British he's British and he seems to have like all the
[01:27:25] stereotypical kind of British personality absolutely yeah he's he he's he he's he's he's he's
[01:27:37] I mean he's he's playing polo and writing books and polo and stuff like this I mean this is it man
[01:27:42] he's hanging out with a king and queen he's got a cigarette holder I mean he's he's British he's the
[01:27:48] quintessential British but the commandos themselves who we who we kind of who we throw in with the
[01:27:55] sort of who who played the biggest role in in creating the creating the British commandos is that
[01:28:01] is that Clark oh yeah Dudley Clark he's the guy who initially comes up with the idea he's another
[01:28:06] weirdo really fun to learn about really fun to write he's he was a he was a British army officer
[01:28:13] he'd grown up I believe in Palestine he had seen me not only he had seen British Raiders during
[01:28:24] the first World War it kind of experienced what some of that was like I think he he was friendly
[01:28:29] with Ward Wingate he was a oh yeah one of the one of the things one of the ways that he got the
[01:28:40] idea for British commandos was he was in fact you would with an Napoleonic War history and
[01:28:44] in fact it was a real student of Wellington's Peninsula Wars and all of the partisans that
[01:28:51] Wellington had hired and and sent against the French forces so he when after the disaster at
[01:29:01] Dunkirk you know Dudley Clark who's a bit you know bit of an oddball in the military
[01:29:07] hierarchy I think his hobby is he's a he's an amateur actor but he puts a little paper together
[01:29:15] and he sends it up to Churchill and it's the paper is essentially create special troops
[01:29:22] that are capable at sea and send them on all of these little raids against the the coastline
[01:29:30] spread out German defenses not you know to similar from what the Navy was trying to do in the central
[01:29:34] Pacific Churchill is the he Churchill's you know completely infatuated with any idea that
[01:29:44] his generals do not like this is one of them he he thinks this is a the great idea not just because
[01:29:51] you know this is going to spread German defenses out but you know more importantly than that it's
[01:29:55] going to energize the British people the British people have just suffered this terrible you know
[01:30:01] the feet at Dunkirk they need a win they need a series of wins so yeah he agrees to it he
[01:30:10] is pushes the entire British establishment to create these commandos what he does not expect
[01:30:19] and what his general stone expect as that these raids start being successful so successful that
[01:30:26] they they want to develop more of them and so the by by the end of or by 1942 there's not
[01:30:35] just British commandos at this point there's Canadian commandos it's French commandos and they're all
[01:30:38] sort of operating under this the COHQ I have you ever read the book Rogue Heroes it's a book about
[01:30:46] the British SAS North Africa it follows them all through the war but point if you want a book that is
[01:30:54] kind of outside of you know the American special operations experience that is that's the one
[01:31:01] it's it's interesting because you know it's even I would say it's the the SAS experience the SAS
[01:31:09] and the SBS experience during World War II establishes a type of commando that we're not familiar with
[01:31:19] like and it establishes a legacy of expectations that you know we don't really have like our
[01:31:25] we have sort of a no fail expectations on our commando operations the SAS the SBS they were
[01:31:31] willing to just try stuff and if they lost an entire team well that's the price of doing business I mean
[01:31:38] and I think they kind of carry that cavalierness through today like I think I mean if you've ever
[01:31:44] worked with SAS or SBS I'm sure you have I mean I don't know if you noticed that and then I certainly
[01:31:50] noticed that when we worked with the SBS these guys are you know maybe not as I wouldn't say
[01:31:56] they're not they're less well trained but they are willing to they they have an expectation of risk
[01:32:02] that I was not familiar with and I think they pulled that directly from this experience in World War II
[01:32:07] so check what else was it that made Dudley-Curt Clark an odd ball I mean the dudes in actor
[01:32:16] and we know Ecos and a bit of an actor I don't think he's odd
[01:32:22] was there some other was there some other thing that dragged you into this or that you
[01:32:27] started getting the feeling this guy's a little strange yeah he leads the first commando raid
[01:32:31] and it's a completely I mean so he has this idea you know not much different than Carlson
[01:32:38] you know to come up with these you know commandos but and I like Carlson he leads one of the first
[01:32:43] raids and like Carlson he's completely unsuited to do it I mean he's not an operational commander he's
[01:32:50] the thinker I think he kind of he suspects that but he's willing to you know put himself on the line to
[01:32:55] prove you know his his idea he ends up going through the war and coming up with he hands up being
[01:33:05] a really capable spy not spy master but like deception officer he's able to convince the
[01:33:12] Germans that you know different points during the war that we're about to attack and in this in this
[01:33:17] spot which forces the Germans to move troops to an area but he leads that first commando raid
[01:33:23] um and they don't really raid anything I think they stumble across to German bicyclists
[01:33:29] they kill both of them they forget to search them they don't know what they were even guarding
[01:33:35] and then on his on his particular raid they one of the one of the guys accidentally
[01:33:41] uh checks a magazine onto a beach right when there's an approaching German patrol the Germans
[01:33:47] counter ambush them and they have to race into the the water to get back to their boats
[01:33:52] when they get back to their boats deadly clock realizes that his year has been almost been shot off
[01:33:56] and a sailor has to stitch it back in place for the transit back to uh uh back to England
[01:34:03] damn yeah getting that year stitched back on by a by a little by a pedi off
[01:34:09] even like in like a freaking zodiac or something yeah and the mission is so badly planned when they get
[01:34:14] when they finally get back uh to the coast back to they they they didn't have any decontriction
[01:34:19] they get stopped by British uh shore but patrol boats uh thinking that they're a German boat
[01:34:25] you know trying to send uh raiders ashore um and when the and when the um uh the coast guard comes
[01:34:30] aboard their their vessel uh all the British commandos are drunk so not only they get shot off the
[01:34:37] beach they drank the entire boats like or supply there you go how about the devil's brigade how
[01:34:44] was that played to this uh whole scene the devil's brigade or um they were just one they were one of
[01:34:50] those uh units that I was really interested in and I really I was almost trying like looking for
[01:34:56] an excuse to to write about them they were um they were a unit that uh was a it was a joint um
[01:35:03] uh Canadian and American uh unit and it was the kind of the brainchild of Mount Baton um Marshall
[01:35:10] had by and uh it was supposed to be a unit that they dropped into Norway on uh like snowmobiles or
[01:35:16] our snow tractors um that would lead raids and ultimately became a pretty adequate um uh
[01:35:23] semi-commando force uh it was an air sort of sort of sort of ranger sort of airborne um and Robert
[01:35:29] Frederick's uh became the commander of it and he was uh as um as interesting as Darby uh you know this um
[01:35:37] uh had you know as equally a story uh career I think he was uh wounded something like nine times uh
[01:35:45] during the course of the war um uh and what was the how come the devil's brigade didn't
[01:35:52] sustain well I mean the army special forces when they are um when they are claiming uh their
[01:36:01] their forefathers they always point to the devil's brigade and I don't really I don't really see a
[01:36:05] connection between uh army special forces and the devil's brigade's getting it in here except
[01:36:11] for the fact that these guys are in the army well they're in the army and they're and they're airborne
[01:36:16] qualified so but they're not leading partisans or anything like that they're shock troops um
[01:36:22] they're more like rangers then they're more like rangers but just like marils marauders
[01:36:25] marils marauders or you know when I set out to write a chapter on the rangers and to talk about
[01:36:30] how the rangers opened a gap for the navy to fill I didn't think that I'd be covering
[01:36:35] Darby other people who had covered Darby before and I was like I kind of want to avoid that I'd
[01:36:39] I'd rather focus on you know a a a ranger legacy that hasn't you know that's less well known and
[01:36:45] my idea initially was to cover the 5307 which is marils marauders in Burma I really wanted to
[01:36:52] instead of sustain a cover the the battle of Mijkina which is an isolated hilltop in Burma
[01:36:58] that the marils marauders sees and there's some you know pretty interesting characters in
[01:37:02] maril he's a he's another odd ball I think he by that point in the war he's been removed because
[01:37:08] he's already had two heart attacks in Burma he stayed in the field no was another excuse for
[01:37:13] you know to talk about still well so was another character that I always you know kind of had a
[01:37:17] soft spot in my heart for but they just didn't fit because you know the reason that I had to cover
[01:37:23] her sister and the reason that that I had to talk about sister and as opposed to point to hawk or
[01:37:27] Mijkina or another one of these really important ranger battles is because sisterina is the one
[01:37:35] that leaves its impression on the army hierarchy on the chain of command even when you have
[01:37:43] a success as incredible as point to hawk even when you have a success as incredible as Kabanatawan
[01:37:49] and the rescue of all those POWs it doesn't leave its legacy or it doesn't leave an impression on
[01:37:53] the army chain of command like sisterna does so sterna clouds an entire generation of hostility
[01:38:01] of regular conventional army leaders to the concept of elite commandos if that makes sense
[01:38:08] yeah that's definitely that that section of the book I'm again I read it on the last the last time
[01:38:13] we were together on this podcast it's just it's it's it's it's very different it's
[01:38:19] tough to difficult even read and and what's incredible about it is it's it's the notes from the
[01:38:25] radial room these are these are transcripts of what was actually said between Derby and his front
[01:38:32] line leadership who are being overrun and slaughtered and you can you can read exactly what they were
[01:38:38] saying to each other it's yeah another just incredible a lot of the a lot of that's taken from
[01:38:45] you know like like you said the transcripts which I that's one of the few times that I was at an archive
[01:38:49] going through it going through a document and not just you know quickly taking a photo and moving on
[01:38:54] that was one of those times where I was like I was trying I mean I knew what happened and I'm
[01:39:00] I was reading it like it was a novel like and I was you know tensing up like knowing what each page
[01:39:07] that each page was gonna get worse and worse and worse and then I was I was watching this unfold in
[01:39:13] an archive you know eight years after the fact but it was you know it was every bit is real to me
[01:39:18] well maybe not every bit is real but you know you're these are you know fellow fellow Americans
[01:39:23] you know doing the absolute best they could for their country for each other and you know the guy
[01:39:28] on the other end of the radio was watching his friends die around him and then before we move
[01:39:33] your chapter for what about what about Charles Shunstrom what's that guy's deal he got cut completely
[01:39:41] out of the book is that right yes sort of I mean he got so he he's responsible for writing the
[01:39:48] Shunstrom report which is the it was there's a report written only well if I do the math
[01:39:57] right probably a month after sisterna so he's one of he's one of the guys that was captured
[01:40:04] in the in the final moments of the the raid he was he had been with Darby all the way through
[01:40:11] the the the rangers experience so he'd been one of the handful of rangers trained
[01:40:16] by the British commandos in actin of carry Scott Scotland fought through north Africa fought
[01:40:22] through Sicily fought through Italy the winter line then he's one of the officers captured he's
[01:40:29] won he's the officer who's driving Darby in jaila when Darby is in the back with a 50 cow
[01:40:35] or with the the recoil is rifle and destroys the Italian tank that turns Darby from Darby into Darby the
[01:40:41] legend so he's with Darby throughout you know the everything he's he's as you know he's as
[01:40:51] incredible or as anyway he he's captured at sisterna escapes two weeks later
[01:41:03] makes it back to friendly lines and from from his escape he's able to write the report of what
[01:41:09] actually happened he's one of the few guys that got out and he drafts this I can't remember
[01:41:14] the ten page report so a lot of what's in those final pages is drawn from the shunström report
[01:41:21] now he has a really tragic end to his life he I can't remember how he passes away I think he's dead
[01:41:29] with in ten years though of of this event he after World War II he I think he goes to Southern
[01:41:36] California he tries to be an actor doesn't work out and then he you know turns to drink
[01:41:42] and a series of bad decisions please to a series of worst decisions and I think he starts robbing
[01:41:46] banks he's one of those guys that you know he just isn't able to reintegrate into society he
[01:41:53] had been a ranger officer one of the you know guys in charge and here he is he's not able to you know
[01:41:59] um uh reintegrate into you know polite society and ultimately I can't remember how he dies but I
[01:42:08] think that some combination of alcohol and um yeah some combination of alcohol robbing banks guns
[01:42:16] just get after it you know this you know this it's pretty good you got to kind of ask yourself
[01:42:25] and I had a conversation with someone the other day about you know that just like modern times and
[01:42:32] all this who's gonna fight the worse yeah right who is going to put freaking black paint on their
[01:42:42] face and pick up a weapon and crawl across the beach and start killing enemy like that's a
[01:42:51] certain type of human being right that's the type of human being that may not correctly reintegrate
[01:42:57] into society this dude might end up robbing banks when he gets back let's it's the Martin Watson
[01:43:03] problem yeah it's the Martin Watson problem which we'll get to but but we do have to think about that and
[01:43:11] when you have guys you know we we talked about obedience as a characteristic being look it's it's
[01:43:18] good to have some obedience yes it is and was Darby maybe too far on a spectrum of being too obedient
[01:43:24] yes but then you get some other guys that are on the other end of the spectrum that's you want
[01:43:27] you want to have someone that's gonna be the handle care what you tell me to do I'm gonna go
[01:43:30] attack this machine gun nest get out of my way you want to have some guys like that now hard to control
[01:43:36] but if you get rid of these guys you get rid of the Charles Chunchrums and the Watson's you get rid of
[01:43:41] those guys your military's not going to be able to function in my opinion that's not gonna be able to win
[01:43:47] I said okay yep you're right it's not it's gonna be able to function probably going to be able to function very
[01:43:51] effectively in a peace time environment so my question you commanded these guys how how I mean what
[01:43:57] what's the answer how do you how do you you know take the strengths of a of a chunchrum or a Watson
[01:44:04] but how do you make sure that they don't go off the rails yeah you what you have to do is you have to put put the
[01:44:09] put the guard rails in place and you have to and it's not here's the the interesting thing about this
[01:44:14] isn't that hard this isn't where you've got to be costly monitoring every single thing that they do
[01:44:21] you have a good relationship with your guys then when you say hey listen here's the line we're not
[01:44:25] crossing it guys go yep Roger that and they know you're not playing around the you haven't
[01:44:31] you haven't uh uh shown them where hey you know jockel says this but he doesn't really mean that no it's
[01:44:38] like when I say something this is what I mean and this is what we're gonna do this is what we're not gonna
[01:44:42] do and and look I mean I had guys that were definitely actually I want to have guys just like I just
[01:44:50] said I want to have guys they were saying hey if I can get if I get the chance to do this in a high
[01:44:55] progressive way I'm gonna do it you you may chance to kill the enemy I'm gonna do it that's what I'm
[01:44:59] here for that's why that's why I was born dude I told you Friday you know Tony a Friday
[01:45:04] Tony was uh Patoon Chief in Charlie Patoon task in a bruiser if he would do anything to be able to
[01:45:11] go out and kill the enemy and he would also never cross the line of like oh okay hey we're not doing
[01:45:15] that cool that's what that's the line and that's exactly what you want um and and what so so
[01:45:22] the question that you posed to me how do you do it what you do is you have a good relationship with
[01:45:27] the guys you explained to them what we can do what we can't do and then you explain why we can't do it
[01:45:33] and there was um uh I used to go and brief the jockey classes the the junior officer training classes
[01:45:39] and and briefed mine okay well there you go one of the things that I used to tell these guys was hey
[01:45:46] listen when it comes to when it comes to the rules of engagement when it comes to the law of
[01:45:52] arm conflict you have to not just do what you think is right you have to do what you think it what
[01:45:59] you have to do not just what is you think is right but what is legal and here's the reason
[01:46:04] and and Lave had to have this conversation Lave had a senior officer in the room when I was
[01:46:08] explaining this to these young guys like yourself that what's what people think is right what you
[01:46:18] you take 16 seals and you say you give them a case example of is this right in your own personal
[01:46:24] moral code you're gonna get 16 different answers you're gonna get so as I said oh yeah this this
[01:46:30] this person's uh in surgeon we'll kill him or this person's in surgeon oh well we shouldn't
[01:46:36] hurt him because we can reform them you can have all these kind of wild different answers
[01:46:41] so what you the only thing you can actually follow isn't what an individual quote thinks is right
[01:46:48] you have to follow what is actually legal and I made that I always made that very clear with my
[01:46:54] guys hey listen this is what you can do this is what you cannot do and here's a why and of course
[01:46:59] in any leadership situation it's important to explain the why and you know for instance in
[01:47:03] Romadi there was a bunch of reasons why you can't go out and shoot an innocent person well first of
[01:47:10] all yeah it's morally wrong second of all everyone would know about her immediately so it's not like
[01:47:15] it's not like I could have a sniper going oh you know I'll sneak in a shot over here and no
[01:47:19] it's gonna know no we're in a city with 400,000 Iraqi civilians that we there's a mayor there's a police
[01:47:25] force there's a there's a governor there's a whole there's teachers and doctors inside that city
[01:47:30] you kill an innocent civilian everybody's gonna know about it and by the way all those Iraqi
[01:47:36] government officials they have relationships with the brigade commanders with the battalion
[01:47:40] commanders with the company commanders we're all talking so if you think oh I'm gonna shoot
[01:47:46] some innocent person get aware that you're never gonna get away with it's not happening and
[01:47:51] on top of that we are now losing the war when you go out and kill an innocent civilian you're giving
[01:47:57] you're giving propaganda to the enemy and you're creating more insurgents by killing an innocent
[01:48:05] person so you have to not just explain hey legally you can't do this but it also here's why you can't do it
[01:48:14] I was speaking to a group of army leaders one time and I said hey in any in any
[01:48:21] platoon you're gonna have a sociopath in there you have somebody that's you give them the opportunity
[01:48:25] to kill or maybe even you don't they they might take advantage of that they're gonna look for an
[01:48:30] opportunity to kill they're gonna look for an opportunity to torture someone they're gonna look for an
[01:48:33] opportunity to rape a woman like you take a platoon you're gonna have that in there and I got some
[01:48:39] looks from the crowd kind of like oh that's not that's not realistic and and no kidding two weeks later
[01:48:45] I was doing a podcast with Jordan Peterson and before we started recording I said hey let me
[01:48:51] ask you a question here's what I told this group of army guys I said in your platoon you're gonna
[01:48:55] have at least one person that's a sociopath is that an accurate statement and he's just how many
[01:49:00] people in a platoon well in a platoon 40 50 and he goes oh you know and I won't try and imitate
[01:49:07] your footage but you know he basically oh yeah definitely and and then he said because it's like one
[01:49:13] in a hundred in normal society that you have a sociopath but the the army or the Marine Corps
[01:49:21] is not normal society you've already screamed out a bunch of people that are definitely not sociopaths
[01:49:28] and so to have you probably actually have two or three sociopaths inside your platoon and
[01:49:35] and then look you also get some guys that just you know like like shun shun shun
[01:49:41] strum he's not necessarily a sociopath but you know who knows how this guy was raised maybe
[01:49:47] okay so somebody gets smacked around you know occasionally you beat someone up
[01:49:53] violence is part of you know culture in some parts of America and some families in America
[01:49:58] like that's what you grew up with so that's what you get so to once again to answer your question
[01:50:04] you got to put you got to put the very clear guardrails in place that said hey look this is
[01:50:08] what we're doing this what we're not doing and then you have to have the the consistency that
[01:50:13] when you say something the guys know that you are not playing around and that you are going to fall
[01:50:18] through with whatever it is you say and and and I think where guys get caught sometimes from a
[01:50:23] leadership perspective is they don't put out those guardrails and then when Ben crosses the line
[01:50:29] and you do something you weren't supposed to do I feel kind of bad because I didn't even tell you
[01:50:33] not to do it so I'm looking at you on well I guess I'm going to you know send you to court
[01:50:37] marshal now and you're going wait a second you know we killed three guys on that last operation
[01:50:42] and four guys on the operation before that now you're mad at me because I killed somebody
[01:50:46] well what were the circumstances well you didn't talk to me about any circumstances well you
[01:50:50] got to know the rules of engagement well I know the rules of engagement that seemed like that
[01:50:52] way to me so you see where I'm going with this I have to be very clear about what the line is
[01:50:59] and why we cannot cross it it also seems like like an extreme team environment like I
[01:51:07] said like in football it seemed like there was some sociopaths there too and actually no of one
[01:51:14] who's I think he's still in jail right now but he in an extreme team environment it's like people
[01:51:21] who are just normal people who are I'm down for the team they get influence just to do stuff
[01:51:25] good and bad just because of the team environment do you find that a lot 100% where it's like I mean
[01:51:33] actually you know it now that I'm thinking of like the massacres certainly yes for sure I mean I'm
[01:51:38] asker that's definitely what happened like although that's what we're doing okay we're ready for
[01:51:42] you know I've been talking a lot about this lately is just the fact that people human beings are so
[01:51:46] so their brains are so applyable you can program a person so easily to believe whatever and by the
[01:51:52] way it's happening all day long right now with all these people out there that are looking at
[01:51:55] their social media all day long that's they're getting program you're receiving information
[01:51:59] you don't even know what you're you're seeing and it's happening right now you know the the
[01:52:04] propaganda that's coming out from both sides from from Ukraine right it's like all you have people
[01:52:08] going high into the right on whatever image that they saw and you gotta take everything that's coming
[01:52:15] out of there where the grain is salt but what it's showing you is how easily influenced human beings are
[01:52:21] and that's a really negative thing but it's also really positive thing because you as a leader have
[01:52:25] the ability to say hey here's what's going on here's what we need to do here's why we need to do it
[01:52:31] here's why we can go to this line and we can't go past it and those are the rules that's that's
[01:52:38] what you need to do if you start to allow slack and then you develop a habit of allowing slack
[01:52:47] you're gonna have a freaking issue you're gonna have you're gonna you're gonna end up with issues
[01:52:50] if you don't have the ability to say hey listen dude just not we're not doing that
[01:52:54] uh one thing that's interesting in the in the seal teams is most of the guys want to do a good job
[01:53:00] and have a good reputation so when you say hey hey Ben we're not doing that or hey Ben it
[01:53:08] looks seem like you were thinking about doing something let me tell you why we're not doing it
[01:53:11] you don't go rules bullshit no you go they had got it boss thanks for explaining that to me it's not
[01:53:16] that hard but if I'm weak and you know that you end up with that dynamic in the military where you have
[01:53:22] a really strong personality or really strong yeah really strong in a brand new officer yep and
[01:53:30] if that that can that that's a classic scenario right that's the that's the damn platoon right that's
[01:53:37] the the movie platoon right you have you have Barnes and you have whatever that officer's name was and
[01:53:43] he just gets run rough shot over by Barnes and that's a perfect example that's a perfect example hey
[01:53:50] you're a new guy shut up you don't know what you're talking about this is the only way to win this okay
[01:53:54] well yes or yes yes sergeant Barnes and then you have a guy like alias who is saying hey but what
[01:54:03] what are you doing but he doesn't have the strength to back it up to into to get his platoon officer
[01:54:11] on board with what's happening so to classic thing to watch out for 100%
[01:54:16] um all right let's jump back into the book here go a little bit more forward going to chapter 4
[01:54:25] chapter 4 draper Kaufman and the course that cracked the Atlantic wall then laid the first bricks
[01:54:32] of the legends of navy the legend of navy special warfare so there you go um and this would just
[01:54:40] really you should have you should have saved that dramatic intake for the last chapter that's the
[01:54:48] longest of the they they they get there's only one that's short there's only one more that's coming
[01:54:52] that's short um i'm gonna read a little chunk from the book here landing at 0625
[01:55:01] one of the earliest crews to arrive Gregory and the army engineers had dragged their rubber boat
[01:55:07] into the surf lashed it to a wooden stake and run for the farthest belt of hedgehogs
[01:55:14] it looked impossible to be there without being hit one of karnowski's men remembered afterward
[01:55:22] it looked even worse without a helmet despite the chaos karnowski and the demolition years
[01:55:28] laid their charges ran out their primer court tied in and blew their charge the first shot
[01:55:34] was magnificent remembered one man after it nothing else was as soon as the charge blew machine guns
[01:55:41] opened up from everywhere and men pushed their bellies into the sand conrad millis a quiet california
[01:55:47] carpenter made chief petty officer for the example he had set during training grabbed the primer
[01:55:53] grab the primer court real and sprinted for the next row of obstacles he was identified later
[01:55:59] by the pack of explosives around his neck with a big hole in his chest
[01:56:05] as the waves of infantry landed the demolition job grew even more complicated
[01:56:09] terrified soldiers either did not notice the purple smoke warnings swirling around them or did not
[01:56:16] care i thought i'd never get one of the infantrymen out from behind a piling a demolition
[01:56:20] year confessed later he moved out just in time and our second shot went off
[01:56:26] as obstacles blew apart the army and navy sections began working together mingling as a single
[01:56:32] team regardless of the advancing tide lieutenant gregarie having destroyed the tank crippling
[01:56:38] hedgehogs at the far end of the beach turned away from the enemy and splashed back into the
[01:56:43] surf like a man possessed he waited or swam to each remaining stake where he waited until someone
[01:56:49] threw him a charge then using the lessons taught to him by the ncd use stretched his arms as far as
[01:56:56] they would reach and placed his bomb next to rommels then blew them to nothing
[01:57:08] so d day you you talk about this being the most consequential day in in the history of NSW
[01:57:18] there's a hundred and navy a hundred and ninety navy demolition years 32 of them are killed 65
[01:57:26] or wounded so that's a total number of casualties being at 97 this is 51 percent 51 percent
[01:57:34] casualties yeah i mean just in contribution or just in sacrifice it's uh um
[01:57:40] right i'll match as any other tragedy or uh that NSW has experienced it's far far exceed anything
[01:57:51] it'll at least in any single day experience and this happens mostly in the space of of around three or four
[01:57:58] hours uh gap assault teams um three and fourteen eleven they're all destroyed even before i'm
[01:58:06] right eleven destroyed as soon as it's ramp drops three and fourteen or destroyed uh
[01:58:11] destroyed before the ramps even drop there they would mourn mortars and just about everybody
[01:58:16] and all of a board is killed um it's the it's the most important day of the 20th century i mean it's
[01:58:25] the day that determines um whether or not Hitler's going to be removed from the continent um and it's uh
[01:58:33] uh it's tough to you know write this chapter and not make it you know out China everything else
[01:58:38] it's a um it's too much the chapter was twice as long when i you know when i finished the first
[01:58:44] draft it was i i wanted to i didn't want to leave anything behind i wanted you know every every
[01:58:50] gap assault team every every NCDU to you know have full representation i think there's 21
[01:58:56] um gap assault teams that that land i ultimately had to you know cut cut cut cut cut cut and try and
[01:59:02] you know consolidate as much as possible just so it was a readable chapter and i also had to like
[01:59:07] figure out what the hell am i trying to say in this thing you know i i expected that um
[01:59:13] writing history of the seal teams or writing how the navy had you know been the first to create this
[01:59:18] type of unit i always expected that it'd be tough to justify how i put the you know the army
[01:59:23] or a marine court chapters and it wouldn't be tough to you know justify the navy chapters
[01:59:28] the navy chapters would just sort of write themselves i just had to say what happened just say what
[01:59:32] happened i found the opposite to be true because you know it was you know what the army chapters
[01:59:38] and the marine court chapters all you really just you know trying to show like why these units failed
[01:59:42] or why they um why the you know they're uh senior leaders pulled the rug out from under them
[01:59:48] the navy chapters you're you're having to you know show how um you know a unit like the
[01:59:54] NCD use which is you know created just a solve one problem and that problem is the obstacles
[01:59:58] in France where the obstacles on the coast how did that why is that relevant you know to the
[02:00:03] ultimate creation of go anywhere you know enable commandos so i um it took a long time and it
[02:00:10] took multiple draft before i realized that the point of this whole thing or the the relevance to
[02:00:15] that story is not so much um you know the fact that they were uh you know just blowing up obstacles
[02:00:22] it's the fact that they left such an impression on the navy leaders after that you know there's
[02:00:28] you know there's you know all these um you know episodes of of naval bravery you know there's the
[02:00:33] experience of the uh uh the the the the the the the destroyers that ultimately save the day
[02:00:39] that pushed the army ashore these destroyers you know they're um they're on the outskirts of uh
[02:00:44] of the battle until um Admiral Hall uh uh uh the army the army is looking at what's happening on
[02:00:50] on a mobile beach there's there's there's successful landings on gold sword Juno there's successful
[02:00:54] landings at Utah beach everywhere the you know the you know the the you know the the landing to get
[02:00:59] troops ashore on dda is going well except here at Omaha Omaha you know the army commander's like
[02:01:05] i we might need to pull our troops off they might need to do something they've never trained to do
[02:01:10] which is a full scale evacuation in front of the enemy at Mohal who has um made it a point to make
[02:01:18] sure that he's in charge of the invasion until uh forces are firmly established ashore says no
[02:01:25] we're not doing that and he does what you know nobody has done up to that point which is push uh
[02:01:30] destroyers right up to the uh to the the as close to the coast as possibly pushes them 800 yards away
[02:01:36] uh from from the coast that's the same destroyers they they come in a flank speed and as soon as
[02:01:42] they get to about uh where their poles are about three feet off the bottom they all turn left
[02:01:47] and they all start going right along the coast so you have all this bravery that happens as
[02:01:52] as soon as they get you know to a point to the end of Omaha Beach you think all these ships
[02:01:56] are going to turn um and some of them do some of them have enough uh um um um depth where they're
[02:02:02] able to turn around the ships that don't they just they just reverse reverse uh and they just
[02:02:08] are going backwards and they're blasting uh away at these uh pill boxes and structures and some
[02:02:14] in some cases they are um they're blasting underneath uh the pill boxes so the pill boxes full of
[02:02:21] Germans just start tumbling off the uh uh off the escarpment um um so in all that I think I've seen
[02:02:29] that represented no it's like in saving private Ryan or anything like that no and everybody
[02:02:36] thinks 100 yards off the beach is freaking close everybody walks away or everybody you know
[02:02:45] comes away from you know the reading of Omaha Beach as this um as this victory of uh American
[02:02:52] infantry over you know the German obstacles um and that's true but there's also another truth and that's
[02:02:59] the um uh that's the commitment or that's the force that the Navy brought to bear on that day and
[02:03:04] then and the army would not have gotten off those killing fields or other killing beaches without
[02:03:08] the contribution of the US Navy but what I found was the point of this chapter was that with all of
[02:03:15] that with all of the the the the the contribution that the Navy had made with all the bravery um the
[02:03:22] the Navy walks away from that battle uh with knowing that the the greatest contribution that they'd
[02:03:30] given that day was with the naval over with with the NCDUs with the naval combat demolition units um
[02:03:36] they are awarded you know some this six Navy crosses um more silver stars and you can check a
[02:03:43] stick at they've got they they award the NCDUs only one of three uh presidential unit
[02:03:49] citations that are awarded from uh a naval unit on Omaha Beach um right so the reason that that's
[02:03:55] so important is because uh when the Navy when the dust settles uh and the the Navy is looking at you
[02:04:01] know they're entire contribution uh at Omaha Beach they know that uh they know how important the
[02:04:06] NCDUs contribution was and more importantly they know how important uh the the curriculum was
[02:04:12] the created these units and that curriculum I don't know if anybody uh in charge of Omaha Beach
[02:04:19] had realized what curriculum had created them but there are people that know and that curriculum
[02:04:25] is now um validated because of uh of everything the NCDUs did and that curriculum as you know
[02:04:33] you know develop a driver coffin yeah and the main part of that curriculum is hell weak
[02:04:38] yeah the the crucible of that curriculum is hell weak and then and the reason that it's it's
[02:04:45] developed is because you know it's the closest thing of the least draper coffin it ever uh
[02:04:51] coming contact with two combat I mean it's a um it at least it matches the experience the draper
[02:05:01] coffin it had when it came to uh combat he'd been you know we can get the draper coffin but um
[02:05:06] um it prepared the guys that went to Omaha Beach uh for exactly what they experienced you know they were
[02:05:16] they were wet they were cold I mean they'd spent almost 48 hours on on ships that were you know
[02:05:21] often some of these ships were sinking of prior to they were so overwhelmed with uh with water and rain
[02:05:27] and um uh that you know they went into battle cold hungry um often you know nearly all of them
[02:05:35] receasic they're all wretched their gut sounds they don't have anything in them when they hit the
[02:05:39] beaches um and then the uh the chaos that unfolds around them is uh they've they've gotten at
[02:05:45] least a taste of it uh on the beaches at Fort Pierce they you know they you know the you know the
[02:05:49] the so-solly day I mean they've been uh peppered with all these bombs going off around them um
[02:05:55] they were probably better prepared for what uh what they encountered than any other troops on Omaha Beach
[02:06:01] yeah the the hell week thing is definitely interesting um because it is it's shocking when you
[02:06:13] when you you look at it and you know the kind of people that show up just the numbers of people that show
[02:06:18] up I mean a class will start with a couple hundred people and by the time they're done with hell
[02:06:24] week they'll be down to 10 15 20 percent of that and these are people that enlisted in the navy
[02:06:34] that had a goal that told their families they were going to be navy seals that dedicated six
[02:06:40] years of their life to signing that dotted line they trained they worked they went to boot camp they
[02:06:45] gave up whatever other possibilities they had in life and they've poured all that into this one singular
[02:06:51] dream without a fallback plan to with no with the crappiest fall there's a fallback plan it just sucks
[02:06:57] sucks but I mean it's not like if you go to the marine court like and you don't you know get into the
[02:07:00] arms like you can still be a pretty awesome marine you're freaking infantrymen in the marine
[02:07:03] court which is a beautiful thing and it's the same thing with the army special operation so you don't
[02:07:06] make it through special forces training okay cool you're a freaking ground pounder which is awesome
[02:07:11] the navy you don't make it through seal training and if you have the mindset where you want to be
[02:07:16] some kind of a machine gun toten badass well guess what you don't make it through seal training
[02:07:23] you are literally not going to be a machine gun toting badass at all and and and that's a horrible
[02:07:30] horrible fate for these young guys but they know that that's their fate and yet with that fate
[02:07:38] they still bring that bell and people from every background people that were division one
[02:07:45] athlete so if every division one athlete wrestlers football players you name it swimmers runners they
[02:07:53] all quit people that were you know raised with a silver spoon in the mouth that went to ivy
[02:07:59] schools they quit people that were raised in the ghetto with really hard lives they quit some
[02:08:03] of them make it some of them quit same with the ivy league some of them make it some of them quit
[02:08:07] it's a crazy crucible and and we still don't even understand it we don't understand who's
[02:08:14] going to make it now I think the only thing that we we really know is where it came from that's about
[02:08:18] it and we don't and I mean as much as draper cough been wrote and I came I mean when I so I
[02:08:26] went to his daughter's house in indiana and she let me have you know two days just to go through
[02:08:35] this entire this humongous file cabinet he kept everything and I there was letters I mean tons of
[02:08:40] the letters between you know him family and friends one thing that he never really kind of
[02:08:46] talked about at least contemporaneously he only really talked about it in his oral history was this
[02:08:51] you know this hell week that he invented I mean and nobody really I mean all the guys that went
[02:08:56] through it talked about it he didn't even talk about you know his own experience going through it so
[02:09:01] after he created hell week and he didn't really create hell week all he did was compress you know
[02:09:06] that that curriculum that you know fill buckloom and all those other scouts and raiders they
[02:09:11] established it all draper coughman did was like okay I like this this is eight weeks long that's
[02:09:16] great let's put it let's make all this five days it's like I can do that well you're just going
[02:09:21] to cut out all this stuff you don't need like you know like sleep well just you know keep keep
[02:09:26] you keep it guy and he did it himself I mean he now lead you know it creates this he put
[02:09:30] himself through the training at 32 years old yeah 30 10 years old and he's a terrible athlete he's a terrible
[02:09:35] athlete just terrible swimmer he can't he can't qualify me his his eyesight he can't even qualify
[02:09:40] for the standards that he sets for himself or for sets for the program like he would not be he would
[02:09:47] not qualify for you know the course that he creates and he does it you visited you visited where
[02:09:56] Omaha Beach you visited four peers yeah how is that with the with the breadth of knowledge that
[02:10:02] you have when you're down there it's incredible it's um there's nothing quite like you know
[02:10:11] going to the places that you're writing about I could have gone I wish I could have gone to
[02:10:15] every single place that I wrote about I've kind of made it a mental mandate for me of a future
[02:10:20] book I'm never going to write about anything unless I go to the place um the uh there's a way to
[02:10:27] Omaha I mean there's a way to you know all of all of Normandy and I mean you I'm not sure
[02:10:37] which point you you should go to the cemetery at Omaha Beach if you should go to the cemetery first
[02:10:43] before you go to the beach heads and before you go to all the battlefields and point to Hawke
[02:10:46] or if you should go see the battlefields and point to Hawke and everything and then go to the cemetery
[02:10:51] either way um you're going to that cemetery and you're going to walk around it and the one thing
[02:10:56] you're going to see and there's a poem by Robert Frost when you before you go to that cemetery and
[02:11:01] it said something like you know uh don't talk um just listen just look and uh note the dates on
[02:11:13] these headstones note how young they were and they died for you and it's it's overwhelming
[02:11:21] and then to take that and then to go see the places where all of these guys were you see
[02:11:25] dog grain dog red and all the all the beaches and then you go to point to Hawke you can't even look
[02:11:30] over the cliffs I mean you see where these rangers they climbed up like and then I mean
[02:11:37] the Germans at the top are cut and ropes and they're throwing grenades and they're leaning over
[02:11:41] the cliffs and they're machine gunning them off the ropes and still they came um and the
[02:11:47] the section that you read of uh karnowski uh he dropped his helmet in the water before you know
[02:11:54] the operation even started before the you know the um for the ramp even dropped he did not have
[02:12:00] a helmet and you you know spent a ran you know from you know and and where was he going to get
[02:12:05] a helmet everybody else needed their helmet there's no other helmets to take and he you know ran
[02:12:09] a shore and um wasn't able to get a helmet you know for almost 24 hours you finally finally
[02:12:19] found a helmet there wasn't a task to somebody that uh he was able to take but yeah and how
[02:12:25] about four pierce four pierces really something then we can talk about four four pierces
[02:12:30] a bit later either there's a uh recently went to four pierces were their annual muster
[02:12:36] and um but yeah I four pierces one of the first places I went and um I didn't I didn't quite
[02:12:43] understand like uh what the island was like with the what the separation of Hutchinson Island was
[02:12:48] because four pierces the actual town it's on the mainland where Hutchinson Island were act you
[02:12:53] know that's what we call we'll call or that's what we call you know four pierces it's actually
[02:12:58] two separate islands there's it's an intercoast all uh island that separates you know from the
[02:13:02] Indian river and the Atlantic Ocean Atlantic is you know kind of a crushing surf and you can see
[02:13:06] all the rocks that are there I mean um the the idea of rock portage and everything like that we all
[02:13:14] you know we you know we always think of it as you know right there at the hotel del
[02:13:19] yeah you know you get this fairy tale hotel you know and and these you know you know you
[02:13:23] know you know humongous you know rocks they have the exact same rocks right there for pierce
[02:13:30] and they did the exact same rock portage you know it's just as dangerous then as it is now um
[02:13:35] but you you you you can see it I mean you uh you can see you know this is the birthplace this is
[02:13:40] where it all happened and it wasn't just the birthplace of you know the NCD used in the scouts and
[02:13:44] raiders but it was the birthplace of you know kind of uh American special operations thinking
[02:13:49] everybody took a turn at four pierces anybody was gonna do any sort of amphibious training any
[02:13:53] special unit was going to take a stop at four pierces the raiders the uh uh the army raiders
[02:13:59] that you know you know uh one of the subwoofer on the Dallas they all everybody everybody
[02:14:05] took a turn through four pierces it was the um um it was the garden bed of uh uh uh
[02:14:12] of special operations thinking at the time so um yeah and if you you might just mentioned the
[02:14:19] the UDTCL museum which is down there in four pierces and that's freaking unbelievable it isn't
[02:14:24] awesome thing that they're continuing to build down there yeah um couldn't have done the book
[02:14:30] without it oh really like as far as them given you information important you in the
[02:14:34] art direction you know it was the first place that I went to and it was um um this was I went there
[02:14:41] before I even knew what an archive was and their archive is um it's not it's not really an art
[02:14:49] I mean it's a it's a it's a room with a bunch of file cabinets and the first time that I went in
[02:14:54] there you know nobody um uh nobody told me what I couldn't look at I mean I just I just went
[02:15:02] in there with a camera and you know I got to work I didn't know where World War II was and
[02:15:06] where Korea was Vietnam but it's all in there and I was gathering stuff that you know um I
[02:15:14] didn't know what I was looking at I took a thousand pictures away my first day at an archive and
[02:15:18] it took me a month to go through them and just to sort of you know figure out this is this this is
[02:15:22] that you know this is an operations plan for Okinawa this is a you know this is an operator for
[02:15:29] you know a trained demolition raid in Korea something like that I mean um but yeah that was the first
[02:15:36] time that I you know really kind of got the evidence of the cold case mystery that I was trying to
[02:15:42] sort out um all right let's move on to and again I've already told you
[02:15:52] if you're listening to this to buy this book and to do it as quickly as you possibly can
[02:15:56] we're literally just hitting wave tops on this stuff there's so much incredible information
[02:16:01] obviously D-Day I mean I read one I read two paragraphs about D-Day there's an entire incredible
[02:16:06] section about all of it about draper Kaufman who we covered him a lot on the first the first time
[02:16:14] you were on because he's such a inc such an incredible character he's not the guy that you would think
[02:16:21] created or was one of the one of the lead role players in creating this organization that we have
[02:16:28] he's a guy you know you know you pointed out on that first podcast is he's a guy that was
[02:16:37] didn't really want to be he didn't want to be some kind of commander he wanted to be a
[02:16:40] a naval officer that wasn't charge of a ship and it just what wasn't gonna happen for him as I
[02:16:44] say it was bad it wasn't gonna happen and he just made things happen he looked around and said
[02:16:50] all right well what can I do and what does the military need what does the what does the what does
[02:16:57] the the the fighting people need because he wasn't necessarily gonna work for America either
[02:17:01] is I who's fighting I'm in yeah I think that's an important I mean for anybody who's trying to
[02:17:07] be a seal right now I mean whether you succeed or whether you don't I mean there's so many ways to
[02:17:11] serve your country I mean here's a guy who spent four years that naval academy hoping to fulfill
[02:17:15] his dream to be a destroyer sailor he wants to just be on a destroyer that's all he wants and it's
[02:17:21] you know the rugs pulled out from under him right at the moment he's he's ready to take the fleet
[02:17:26] and he's got to come up with plan B there's an old plan B he's gonna be but he doesn't you know
[02:17:31] let that paralyze him he when he doesn't see a way to contribute to his country he makes one up
[02:17:41] and he makes one up again the thing that just keeps the his guiding star in that whole process
[02:17:48] it's just like I want to be useful I want to you know help and I want to be as close as I can to
[02:17:54] you know to that to that help and if I can you know if I can't fight then I'll carry
[02:17:59] all carry stretchers I'll be an ambulance driver if I can't be an RAF pilot or if I can't be on a
[02:18:05] British ship then I will dispose the bombs that are landing in central London if I can't be a ship
[02:18:11] driver in the US Navy then I will teach the rest of the Navy how to dismantle bombs I'll do whatever I can and then
[02:18:17] money's anyway yeah that's it's an incredible incredible story that it's just crazy it's a crazy
[02:18:27] thing he's a he comes a French ambulance driver and then becomes a British naval officer and then
[02:18:34] finally they eventually led him into the US Navy that's crazy yeah I mean if you want to like for
[02:18:40] somebody and his dad is one of the most famous destroyer skippers in the Navy and his dad I mean
[02:18:46] who clearly loves the sun I mean you see the you see the paralysis and you know like we talked
[02:18:53] about last time the paralysis and the letters between the two like he knows that the sun's
[02:18:58] going to be committed or sent on these you know terribly dangerous missions it's never been done
[02:19:03] before like when before draper coffin heads out with UDT5 to scout the beaches for a
[02:19:09] side pan his dad knows that these guys are going into combat with nothing and the letters are
[02:19:16] you know he signs them off you know just the same way you know anybody any any other dad would you know
[02:19:21] love you lots and lots of luck and that's all I can do like it's all I can do for you it's not going
[02:19:27] to be a second or see it on a sun's behalf craziness chapter five the evolving contest that
[02:19:37] created the merman of war world war two is only indispensable special operations unit so we we
[02:19:46] we have that controversy about the merman yes we don't really like that term we don't but it's
[02:19:52] out it's what got used right well yeah yeah they used it I mean that's the I think that was the
[02:19:58] the rigley spirit mack gum hour that was on the radio I mean that's where it came from they called
[02:20:05] they came to merman of war yeah unfortunate little puppy's history but we can't change it
[02:20:12] all right going to the book here real quick and the in the late summer of 1943 right about the same
[02:20:17] time that draper coffin was putting himself through hell week U.S. commanders in the Pacific were
[02:20:21] about to initiate two campaigns with one ultimate objective the invasion of Japan blocked by a
[02:20:29] swath of ocean five times the size of the sahera and whose every atoll had been turned into a
[02:20:34] Japanese fortress the strategy to accomplish this objective was wanting which the allies would leap
[02:20:40] frog most islands especially the most robustly defended let them wither on the vine said Douglas
[02:20:47] MacArthur and sees a handful upon which they could build airfield substantial enough to support
[02:20:53] the long range four engine bombers needing to need it to soften up the next handful on the way
[02:21:00] to mainland Japan in the south Pacific this path would progress from the mountainous jungles of
[02:21:06] guadal canal to a nearby group of similar islands many well chartered and populated and all
[02:21:12] of them battle fields large enough for the U.S. armies and MacArthur's ambitions in the central
[02:21:19] Pacific this path would start some two thousand miles west of Hawaii in the Gilbert island chain
[02:21:25] the first Lily Pans large enough to support bomber sized airfields but so small so remote
[02:21:32] so daunting that their volcanic spines of white sand and green palms could almost be mistaken
[02:21:38] for the rigid backs of a thousand sea monsters and there was only one branch of service
[02:21:45] that could lead the hunt against those the same branch that would go on to break hitlers at
[02:21:51] land at wall but employing in altogether different kind of method indeed a method unlike any
[02:21:59] in military history so you're setting us up pretty strong there right
[02:22:07] for this to make them for the merman true true this is the first time the navy is kind of
[02:22:15] the master of the battle space first time in history and that's gonna play into a significant role
[02:22:22] because we need to get on to these islands we need to figure out how to get on to these islands
[02:22:29] and there's this weird little gap this weird little gap of information this weird little gap of
[02:22:34] tactical control that no one really knows how to fill what's the what's the myth behind
[02:22:47] Taurua the Taurua is every history that I'd ever read about the seal teams
[02:22:54] starts with a vineet about Taurua and that Taurua is this meat grinder battle in 1943
[02:23:07] in which the Marines they take this island and the central Pacific and in three days
[02:23:17] the Marines lose as many men as they've lost in the entire six month battle for Guadalcanal
[02:23:22] it's it's it's the first time that Americans realize that this is going to be this is going to be
[02:23:30] something this is like the Shiloh moment in the Civil War where Americans realize this is going to be
[02:23:36] everybody's terrible it's going to be a monster and you're going to have to do this on island
[02:23:42] on every island across the Pacific to get to Japan if we're going to carry this you know
[02:23:48] FDR's policy of unconditional surrender against the Japanese this is going to be a bloody
[02:23:55] bloody battle or bloody way to do it and so the idea is that you know part of the reason the
[02:24:03] Taurua was such a meat grinder is because the landing craft couldn't get past the coral reefs
[02:24:08] which is true the landing craft couldn't get past the coral reefs and that's going to be a problem
[02:24:13] on every subsequent battle but the Marines had already anticipated that the Navy had already
[02:24:18] anticipated that and they had fielded a new technological solution to overcome it which was the LVT
[02:24:23] or the amphibious tractor it wasn't landing craft as much as it was you know a tractor that could
[02:24:29] float and it certainly got to a coral it would just crawl right over it I think they brought 125
[02:24:37] Tatarua there I think there's only a handful left by the end of the first day the rest are
[02:24:44] technologically they're broken so the subsequent days the only Marines that can land to support
[02:24:53] her you know they're kept on the outskirts of the battle by this coral reefs so they have to
[02:24:58] you know drive up the Higgins boats they drop their ramps the Marines rush out into the coral
[02:25:02] and they jump into the lagoon and then they got this 3,000 yard wave to shore where they've got to
[02:25:07] you know deal with mortars the sheen gunfire and there's a you know pilots that are flying above
[02:25:12] this tragedy and and they the the record is that you know this lagoon this you know pristine blue lagoon
[02:25:20] it never it's never free of red I mean it's just it's a it's a see a wash with red the entire three days
[02:25:29] and and it's it leaves an impression on everybody encounters it just because of the
[02:25:36] you know the Marines that are being pulled from this lagoon for the next three days they can
[02:25:39] play there just know they don't have hair they're completely swollen it's a it's a crime scene every
[02:25:43] every single person in there that's a crime scene so the you know the myth is that because of this
[02:25:51] you know the navy decides that they have to on every subsequent battle they've got to
[02:25:57] creating unit that can destroy the coral so the landing craft can get in there which is true sort of
[02:26:03] the landing craft you know the the the coral is a problem and it does need to be destroyed
[02:26:07] the bigger issue that creates the UDT which ultimately creates a seal team is not so much the
[02:26:15] coral as it is the fact that the navy is at this point in the war they're not given access to the
[02:26:24] Marine Corps special units because the Marine Corps like I said in chapter one they have elevated
[02:26:30] their status to such a point that they are now on parity with the navy so up until that point the
[02:26:35] Marine or the the navy had this impression that the Marine Corps was at subservient service and on
[02:26:41] every battle navy add rules could trump Marine Corps generals but at this point in the war Marine
[02:26:47] Corps generals they're just as they're they're on they're on par with their their navy add
[02:26:54] rules so if the navy wants to send out reconnaissance troops a special reconnaissance mission or
[02:27:00] if they wanted to conduct a raid or anything like that they've got to go through the Marine
[02:27:03] Corps because they're the only guys that are there they only service that has a unit that could do
[02:27:08] any of those things so when Turner Turner is the the commander of the fifth amphibious force
[02:27:15] he does not he hates this policy absolutely hates it he's the he's the biggest I describe
[02:27:23] Ms. the the first a personification of an actual life aab and the pacific theater he is he's the
[02:27:31] biggest the biggest dick that's ever served in the the the surface navy he's a he's a he's a
[02:27:38] he's a tyrant almost and he absolutely hates the fact that he does not have control of the
[02:27:44] Marines in the way that he anticipated having control of the Marines so he's not as concerned about
[02:27:50] destroying the coral as he is with having his own unit that he can control that he can send out to
[02:27:56] find out information and either find it out cut it out whatever that's why he creates the UDTs
[02:28:03] it's not a it's not a issue of coral as it is a control yeah one of the characters
[02:28:13] that you cut I guess James Jones from the recon company what's this guy all about James Jones is
[02:28:22] so one of the options that the navy had prior to this sort of re-alignment or reassessment of
[02:28:28] Navy of Marine Corps authority would would have been the back recon company the the the
[02:28:33] the back fifth amphibious force VAC that would have been a unit that Kelly Turner Admiral Turner
[02:28:41] would have had access to to send on special special missions special assignments including missions
[02:28:47] to destroy coral fine coral things like that but now that the Marine Corps is you know has the
[02:28:54] status that it does you know it doesn't really have access to this unit anymore but it's a it's sort of
[02:29:00] the the replacement for the Marine Corps Raiders it's not as big as the Raiders were intended to be but
[02:29:06] they they they sort of formed us unit around James Jones he's a he's a really interesting character
[02:29:13] he was a tractor salesman in Africa before the war and just by being a tractor salesman he
[02:29:20] manages to pick up multiple languages is a really really interesting guy and he was one of the initial
[02:29:27] guys that put in charge of the of the observer group which was the unit that ultimately became
[02:29:32] the scouts and Raiders is a side note he is the father of James Jones the national of
[02:29:43] Obama's first national security advisor. Great father or grandfather father wow he's a father
[02:29:50] and I so when I was doing my initial research for this I was trying to get an interview with with him.
[02:29:57] No no dice I was close I had I was going back back and forth with his secretary he has a
[02:30:08] not a non-profit but like a strategic thing thing thing and I was going back and forth with his
[02:30:13] secretary couldn't make it work so no dice you're right no dice no dice and well then what happened
[02:30:20] with the with the back with them the back re-con company they initially they they have some
[02:30:31] a pretty pretty impressive raids right around the time of tarua they they raid a little island of
[02:30:40] apamama that's you know it's kind of a it's a similar make an island style raid they use the same
[02:30:47] submarine that they the Raiders use for making island they they it's it's kind of a textbook
[02:30:56] island raid you know navy and marine core cooperation but after after that they they don't really
[02:31:05] do much until the battle of Okanawa and the reason that they're important is because they're kind of
[02:31:10] once the UDT are created you can see how important the UDT become and how less important every
[02:31:17] other unit becomes and at one point the back re-con company doesn't really have a mission so they
[02:31:23] assign them to the UDTs and so they take every marine that's in the back re-con company that can swim
[02:31:28] and they plug them into a UDT do they actually get transferred to the navy or no no they don't get
[02:31:35] transferred and by Okanawa they they separate themselves from the UDT again and they're back
[02:31:41] to doing their sort of island raids but until Okanawa there's not a lot of other like little
[02:31:45] satellite islands to do the things that they they were trained to do and then what about the USS
[02:31:53] Burfish recon of of YAP this was a UDT UDT 10 operation what was going on there yeah that was one of the um
[02:32:06] that's in August of 44 there's a series of sort of secret um reconnaissance so after the Tinian
[02:32:16] reconnaissance which draper coffin leads um it's a it's a combined reconnaissance between uh back
[02:32:23] recon so the marine recon and UDT swimmers um the navy really sees the potential of doing these
[02:32:31] night secret reconnaissance of various islands so the next group of islands that the uh uh specific
[02:32:39] planners are hoping to capture are in the pull out so pelaloo that whole episode in the war so one
[02:32:45] of the satellite islands of pelaloo is this island of YAP and uh so the USS Burfish with a contingent
[02:32:54] of UDT swimmers half of whom are uh not haven't really been trained in the traditional UDT curriculum
[02:33:03] which they established at Maui but um half of them are actually OSS maritime swimmers they send a
[02:33:10] combined uh recon team ashore at YAP uh three of the swimmers get separated from their boat the boat
[02:33:17] ends up paddling back to the uh the U.S. at Burfish which is the submarine uh they come back
[02:33:22] out the next night trying to recover uh the swimmers hoping that they've managed to stay alive ashore
[02:33:27] and not get captured um but they uh after the second night they realized they're not going to be
[02:33:32] able to have a link up and uh three swimmers get left behind and they are three they're the as far
[02:33:39] as I know they're the only three missing um well there's there's a couple of others but um
[02:33:44] they're three on accountant for and SW members out there we still have not recovered their bodies
[02:33:50] we think um based off of the research of one uh archivist at uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[02:33:58] the national archives uh who's also uh Moonlight says a historian himself named patch he's put together a
[02:34:03] pretty uh pretty convincing argument the the bodies are probably a bubble through app um they're
[02:34:10] buried with uh handful of other uh captured American aviators but we have not not found them there's
[02:34:16] an effort right now uh by project recover uh to try and track their bodies down
[02:34:24] alright um but like likely they were captured they were bounced around the Japanese tried to
[02:34:30] you know do a cover up of their execution they said that they were put on a transport uh
[02:34:35] bound for the South Pacific back to the Philippines uh based off of the research the night patch
[02:34:40] did it looks like that was all just manufactured and they were killed right there
[02:34:45] so that that chapter kind of kind of brings the the underwater demolition teams sort of how
[02:34:51] how we really got the traction going on the underwater demolition team's and then in chapter six
[02:34:56] you start going into just the the uh totally different aspect of warfare i mean a totally
[02:35:04] different aspect of warfare chapter six is called the contest for gorilla war in China and the
[02:35:10] organization that had no damn business fighting it the US Navy's army of soldiers and this is definitely
[02:35:19] one of the wildest um sections in the book all pretty much sentinel centered around this this guy
[02:35:27] miles um who this is like a whole book onto itself of course i guess i say that over again
[02:35:36] for all your characters but this guy's insane no i mean i literally at the end i guess he is insane right
[02:35:42] i mean the effort breaks him it completely breaks him he's uh he's committed uh to a mental
[02:35:51] institution uh it takes him several months to and part of that's drug induced i mean he's self
[02:35:57] medicating by the end of the war um taking an incredible uh cocktail worth of medicine just
[02:36:02] to you know either stay awake go to sleep and then uh deal with the the pain uh that he's
[02:36:08] deal with the in the fever too he's got almost constant malaria throughout the entire war but yeah i
[02:36:13] mean of all the guys that i i mean i say there's kind of a um uh a horse race uh in my head for who
[02:36:19] is the weirdest character in the war and miles is definitely leaning for the tape i mean he's like
[02:36:25] yeah i mean he's he's fascinating in um in the sense of how unremarkable he seems like when you meet
[02:36:32] miles like he seems like any other ship officer that you would encounter just like a few
[02:36:37] you know did a visit or any of the you know uh other guys you know he's he's not a physical
[02:36:42] specimen he's kind of you know nerdy looking he's just forgettable he's totally forgettable he's not like
[02:36:48] he's not like a exotic person he's not like uh he's not like a Lawrence of Arabia type character at all
[02:36:55] and yet he does every i mean what he contributes to the war is every bit as remarkable as
[02:37:00] as a Lawrence of Arabia yeah i mean we we were on over the figures on the last time you were on
[02:37:04] this podcast but he ended that there this massive gorilla force that he ends up running
[02:37:08] with no business doing with no business doing that and that's what that's from the title
[02:37:12] no damn business that comes from another navy officer one of miles friends he's like
[02:37:16] we have no damn business doing that i found the letter like if if you know one of miles
[02:37:22] as friends thinks that you know we the navy has no damn business then what hope did we really
[02:37:27] ever have yeah and yet the impact that they had was completely strategic they end up killing
[02:37:32] um someone in the neighborhood of twenty five thousand i think enemy japanese soldiers but more
[02:37:37] important tying up a million of them but only lost a handful of Americans i doesn't account for
[02:37:45] the number of chinese lost i mean yeah but yeah right i mean the the chinese contribution is you know
[02:37:50] it's unaccounted for and you know significant but yeah only i some six six american
[02:37:57] uh six american deaths in the entire effort which is a you know the effort you know stretches
[02:38:02] from nineteen forty two to all the way to nineteen forty five i mean it's it's absolutely right
[02:38:08] there should be a book written about this and when i when i got into this i didn't want to
[02:38:11] write this chapter i was so tired of not so tired but i was like i was so anxious to be done with
[02:38:16] world war two when i finished my UDT chapter and i was so ready to move on to Korea i just want
[02:38:21] a different scenery different a different a record group with the national archives uh when i got
[02:38:26] to this point what i mean all i wanted to do is leave and i was just trying to like
[02:38:30] take this china stuff and kind of stuff it into like an introductory section of my Korean war
[02:38:35] chapter and i couldn't do it one chapter or one page became two pages and became three pages and
[02:38:40] four pages and i'm like mother mother had to write a whole new chapter and derailed my entire timeline
[02:38:46] for you know finishing the book what's the movie potential for uh for this for this i think that
[02:38:51] i mean i think you know if you have to if i was gonna say like which of these i think they
[02:38:56] could all be movies but you know if you haven't seen we've seen you know say we're private Ryan
[02:39:04] we've never seen a uh a representation of a real war like what happened in china and world
[02:39:12] war two it could totally it miles as such a you know interestingly an interesting character he could
[02:39:18] be like i mean he's interesting in the fact that he's so boring but he does i mean he's i mean
[02:39:25] survives 40 assassination attempts he's uh he's a naval officer who's involved and and probably
[02:39:32] more ground combat than anybody else uh in history yeah including a freaking cavalry charge on
[02:39:38] camels yeah it's nuts it's nuts the whole thing is nuts but yeah that the movie potential of
[02:39:44] chapter six is high i think the movie potential of you know the UDD chapter is just as high too
[02:39:49] i mean that's i mean the i mean the emergency or i i can see a movie of you know these guys you
[02:39:55] know totally you know going into battle with just knives and you know fins and masks let me
[02:40:01] pretty need you have another character that you bring in here uh going to the book at 60 years old
[02:40:07] thick jowled and with white hair parted just off center wild build dawn event a nickname he had
[02:40:13] earned as a volunteer leading soldiers through mud gas and death on the western front looked in
[02:40:19] his uniform nothing like the head of an insatiable unconventional warfare organization and more
[02:40:26] like an overweight toddler playing dress up for signs of the former one had to look elsewhere first
[02:40:34] to his left breast where he had humbly affects a single ribbon his metal of honor in effect saying
[02:40:41] to his peers that no other awards mattered and second to a career as an attorney as a new
[02:40:48] York attorney and politician occupations that it introduced him to everyone from movie stars to
[02:40:53] Mussolini and taking him farther around the world than most presidents he had been to cyber
[02:40:58] it aside as a bolster vix to the far east a hunt down business Ethiopia to toward the Italian
[02:41:03] front the balklands turkey and Spain as a presidential presidents unofficial envoy in past ages
[02:41:10] a hero milionaire like donovan could have responded to a world crisis simply by raising his own
[02:41:15] regiment equipping it and leading it into battle in the 20th century such impulses had been curbed by the
[02:41:22] increasing complexities of modern warfare and a corresponding bureaucracy that recognized the limited
[02:41:28] value of eccentric amateurs metal of honor not now blocked from commanding regular troops donovan
[02:41:35] courageous entrepreneurial imaginative and most of all unstoppable had set his sights on the
[02:41:42] only field of action whose battle lines had not yet been drawn and on the one man who stood in his way
[02:41:53] what's up with donovan dude well it's an it's an impossible contest i mean
[02:42:01] donovan is when i when i set out to write this not this chapter but when i i i set out to write
[02:42:09] an OSS chapter and i i was attracted to it just because of donovan he is a i mean there should be a
[02:42:18] donovan movie he's i mean all the you know the stories about jad or Hoover you know dressing up
[02:42:25] women's clothes these are rumors that donovan started i mean he's responsible for so much and
[02:42:33] you know what when you say that you mean he actually was responsible for starting the rumors about jad
[02:42:38] or Hoover jump dressing up in women's clothing he yes that's what we're saying i'm saying yes he is
[02:42:43] responsible i'm not saying that this isn't hypervaly this is what this guy did no in the reason he did
[02:42:48] that is because at the time the OSS and the FBI were in some sort of competition for the international
[02:42:56] intelligence mission and one of the two across dresser he wanted to delegitimize his rival is
[02:43:01] best as he could i mean and and at the same time jad grouver was he was putting rumors out there
[02:43:09] that donovan was having an affair with his daughter and law so they were both at each other from like
[02:43:14] so is there any truth through the rumor of jad grouver dressing up in women's clothing i don't know
[02:43:17] about that but i think there is suspicion that donovan was actually having an affair with his daughter
[02:43:21] and law that's not the life yeah that's that's pretty uh and so how does he play into our
[02:43:27] story here for for the development of the seal teams so donovan's important because donovan
[02:43:32] sees what the navy's doing in china any once it he doesn't think the navy should have anything to
[02:43:37] do with this uh donovan has established himself as the uh the head of the international or head
[02:43:42] of the u.s intelligence organization which he has understood uh to include all sorts of special
[02:43:49] programs um so if there's going to be a guerrilla warfare effort in china o s s is going to be
[02:43:55] in charge of it so he comes to china um so first uh he tries to uh rope miles into the o s s and
[02:44:04] he establishes miles as an o s s not operative but uh head of an o s s program problem is um
[02:44:10] um donovan also wants to send all of his uh o s s folks uh to support so soko um but miles
[02:44:21] miles starts to receive these guys and they're all you know um a lot of these guys are you know
[02:44:28] they're you know pretty interesting guys but miles doesn't want anything to do with them
[02:44:32] they're like wannabes i get that it's for the wannabes it's for like they because because
[02:44:36] of his mile boondoggers he was who miles is getting is marine co officers like primarily right
[02:44:41] he's getting marine co officers in the beginning but what he really wants are people that don't
[02:44:45] know anything about china he doesn't want racist uh miles is um that weird he's the peculiar
[02:44:52] type of officer who actually he likes the the indigenous people that he's working with he doesn't
[02:44:58] want them to um i mean he's he's a perfect character for you know you know today but at the time
[02:45:05] like nobody really understands like what's his hang up he he's in fact you wait with china he's
[02:45:10] in fact we were with the chinese he thinks that these are uh uh you know members of the most you know
[02:45:17] one of the most civilized um you know uh countries on the planet um and he uh has a respect for
[02:45:25] them in a way that other america does don't um he he totally rejects uh the the orientalism or the
[02:45:33] uh the the superior american idea in that way he's he's just like you know teelorns i mean he's
[02:45:41] he's a believer he's the worst kind of person and so i mean he's like he actually my worst worst kind
[02:45:48] of person i'm really joking he's like um to other people he's uh he's not pliable he's um um he really
[02:45:58] believes in the potential of these uh uh chinese soldiers to tie the japanese down or to actually attack
[02:46:04] them and you know donovan comes in and donovan's a manipulator donovan's been manipulating for
[02:46:08] years um he's he you know managed to he he's world himself uh into positions his entire uh you know
[02:46:15] since since he got that metal of honor he's used it to you know plow pathways through your bureaucracy
[02:46:22] and to create a unit that never should have been created to create the so as that and to and some of
[02:46:28] his schemes are completely hair-bright um but some of them are not some of them are actually you know
[02:46:32] pretty good so he when he sees donovan he's trying or when he when donovan sees miles he first
[02:46:37] wants to you know put miles under his thumb and when miles can't be put under his thumb he tries to
[02:46:43] take the whole thing and leave miles with the weather stations that's all he wants to leave miles
[02:46:46] with he wants to take this entire guerrilla army that miles is starting to build um and he just
[02:46:52] ifies that because miles is some you know like like quote in the book he's not putting scouts other barrel
[02:46:57] had fast enough and he almost does it he gets real close but the thing that stops him is the
[02:47:04] Chinese won't work with Donovan but they do like miles they can smell the intent yeah right
[02:47:10] absolutely Donovan is freaking shady it's tough to you know I mean he has he's got to be shady a little
[02:47:18] he is I mean he you know it's tough to not you know respect out of and he's he's a character like
[02:47:25] and he you know but he's a he's a he's a toddler with a with a flamethrower all right can we go back real quick
[02:47:34] there's two characters that I want to talk about from the UDT I think that okay hit him Alan Gordon
[02:47:40] Leslie I was I was thinking about the contribution of other other branches of service to the UDTs
[02:47:51] Alan Gordon Leslie is a marine that gets attached to seal tea earth to UDT five he becomes
[02:47:58] draper coughman's executive officer of UDT five for the Battle of Sipan he is he's Canadian
[02:48:07] and I was thinking about him the other day because we're here in San Diego and I was walking
[02:48:13] through the hotel del and I was looking at this you know monument to you know Victorian architecture
[02:48:19] and everything and it was there you know during World War II and Gordon Leslie he goes through the
[02:48:26] entire war he he's one of the scout snipers who ceases the pier at Tara he shoulders a a flamethrower
[02:48:33] and assaults the entire pier so that there's this there's this pier you know cutting into the
[02:48:38] the lagoon that Tara and that that that pier would have threatened to cut into the flank of the
[02:48:45] the Marines that were landing on the beach so the Marines had to take it before they landed so they
[02:48:49] sent a scout sniper put him to do it and Gordon Leslie was the guy with the flamethrower he's fighting
[02:48:54] all you know pillbox to pillbox or the in placement to in placement and you know you know
[02:48:58] using the the flamethrower to destroy guys well he's got a machine gunner to his left and they're
[02:49:04] going down this incrementally taking the entire pier he survives the Battle of Tara and it becomes
[02:49:11] a he volunteer for the UDT as sort of a Marine Corlie's on but he falls in love with the UDT
[02:49:18] and manages to stay with them and the Marine Coral completely loses track of me they don't know
[02:49:23] where he is they think they think he's a casualty he stays with UDT five throughout the remainder of
[02:49:29] the war and when he ends the war he tries to transfer from the officially transfer from the Marine
[02:49:36] Coral to the UDT he wants to stay with the frogman that becomes so controversial it goes all the way
[02:49:41] up to the common dot to the Marine Coral and Marines say we're not losing a Marine to the Navy
[02:49:46] especially to the UDT we're we're gonna keep him so he's entitled to like $4,000 for the back
[02:49:52] pay it because he hasn't gotten three years so in in retaliation he takes his $4,000 he goes to the
[02:50:00] hotel del he slaps that $4,000 on the on the front desk reserves a peninsula of rooms
[02:50:07] in the del and he throws a two week bender it's so bad the Draper Kaufman has to put up a watch
[02:50:14] bill of officers to make sure that his frogman don't leave that wing of the hotel.
[02:50:23] Good times and who's the other guy you wanted to bring up?
[02:50:26] Normons are uh C. Moro and Scamander C. Moro and so one of the one of the the great
[02:50:35] things about you know doing the research for this book is you get to discover all of the
[02:50:39] uh the characters that weren't seals or that weren't frogman that contributed to the
[02:50:45] the importance or the the success of naval special warfare and one of those one of those
[02:50:50] that's always stood out to me is Commander C. Moro and he was a destroyer skipper
[02:50:58] and he was involved in the the fire support mission prior to the invasion of Tenian.
[02:51:05] So Tenian is the greatest strategic um battle probably of the entire central Pacific
[02:51:13] uh campaign. It's the island that ultimately becomes the uh um the airfield
[02:51:20] that they uh you know fly all the uh long range bombers to to bomb Japan on.
[02:51:26] That's it's where the anologate takes off from uh to bomb Japan it's it's a perfect
[02:51:31] uh table top island um but before it can be that it has to be taken and one of the the biggest
[02:51:39] coups of the war is Draper Coffman's reconnaissance of the of the beaches that uh nobody ever thought
[02:51:44] anybody could land on but in order to sell that in order to land all those troops on those
[02:51:49] uh beaches that nobody expects uh UDT7 has to stage this elaborate um ruse uh on the south of the island
[02:51:57] uh uh at Tenian town and so um on the day of the actual invasion when all the
[02:52:05] Marines are secretly sneaking into the uh the beaches of the Draper Coffman has found um the UDT7
[02:52:11] is you know conducting a daylight you know reconnaissance and they're protected by you know multiple
[02:52:17] battleships one being the USS Colorado and I'm like Colorado has lighted self up um a midships
[02:52:23] or uh uh uh with a broadside uh to the beach um and it takes devastating um uh nail gunfire
[02:52:31] uh shore gunfire um and the guns are knocked out and the suddenly uh all the swimmers of UDT7 are
[02:52:37] exposed and they're they're about to uh the Japanese are about to switch their guns away from the
[02:52:42] ships they're defending them two of the swimmers in the water now see more ons is the brother and
[02:52:46] law of Draper Coffman he sees what's happened he sees that the Colorado's guns have been knocked out
[02:52:52] and he commands his ship without orders he commands uh the Norman Scott to get between the
[02:52:58] Colorado so one the Colorado can escape and two so he can also protect uh the UDT swimmers that are
[02:53:04] in the water suddenly uh the USS Norman Scott becomes the center of all Japanese uh nail gunfire
[02:53:11] and it's destroyed uh i think 47 sailors are killed in the process uh including seymour owns but
[02:53:19] he does it because he knows how important it is to draw the Japanese attention away from those beaches
[02:53:24] in the north damn um we're doing we're doing we're doing uh i'll tell you i were doing
[02:53:36] we we're we're gonna stop for today uh that's the end of World War II right um and again um
[02:53:45] that's the end of World War II we hit some of the wave tops we hit there there's so much more
[02:53:49] incredible information in the book um get it but what we'll do is we'll just we'll just record
[02:53:55] another podcast um actually we'll just do it after this one so people can stay in the groove on it
[02:54:01] but i think that's about it for today because we're looking at we're already at three hours bro

[02:55:53] all right the i saw another brand like that i was like no you did no you didn't there's no other
[02:55:58] brand like this there's no one else is doing this if someone goes oh you know we're going to get

[02:56:13] and get imprinted cool now you got a brand bro no that's not what i'm talking about we invested
[02:56:19] our lives into this into buying the equipment capturing the know how you know you talk about
[02:56:28] how some of the people that you would you have interviewed that have since died uh and and you
[02:56:34] wouldn't have been able to capture the knowledge we've actually had that happened at origin people
[02:56:37] that the old timers and i mean that with all due respect the old timers the people that
[02:56:42] knew how to run a loom that people that knew how to work on machines that people that knew how to
[02:56:45] weave and knit they they passed this information out some of them were losing them now so
[02:56:53] if you started a brand for you know $4,000 by ordering some stuff from china and slap that

[03:05:11] Man, this is a story right here that we're talking about
[03:05:14] is about opportunities about so looking for opportunities.
[03:05:17] It's about taking ownership of what's going on in your world.
[03:05:22] It's about seeing where you can help out.
[03:05:25] It's about seeing where you can fill a gap.
[03:05:29] That's what this is about.
[03:05:31] The seal team just didn't sprout up from nowhere
[03:05:36] into this fully blossomed flower.
[03:05:39] Then happened at all.
[03:05:41] It happened one piece of dirt at a time
[03:05:45] to build up into something that's worthwhile.
[03:05:48] That's the way life is.
[03:05:50] And the only way that happens is if you go out there
[03:05:53] and get after it.
[03:05:55] And until next time, this is Ben Milligan,
[03:05:58] Dendeko and Jocco.
[03:06:00] Out.
