and it was like jocco willink predicts the future or something like that because I was with on with jolrogant and jolrogant's like what do you do about these ISIS guys now how could you ever defeat them and I was like if you gave the ISIS problem to like a Marine Corps second lieutenant and said like hey figure on a planet how to beat these guys they could do it it's like there's a bunch of bad guys surrounding them and move through and kill them all that's what we're gonna do but you were harassing me saying like when you're gonna write your protocol book because I've talked about you know how you gotta have protocol for certain situations that are right like you said things that are real emotional things that are moving real quick things that you know you're you need to be thinking about but you won't be able to think clearly about when they're actually going on and that's what you're talking about you know you guys put together a protocol to follow and the navy has one of the teams have one Because it be guys that were all over me guys we like we know everyone you know know everyone on on the west coast know every guy like there are friends and you know now our our platoons that were up north um you know when they kicked off the liberation of Mosul which was the biggest military operations since the invasion of Iraq and there were I believe three different main lines of approach going towards the city and ISIS pretty much controlled everything on the outside guys the first couple days of that there were semi trucks that were loaded with explosive vehicle born ied that was a semi like I don't think you know outside of the moab we don't have a bomb that's carrying that much stuff coming at them um and that's where you know uh EOD chief fine-in was killed on the first couple days when our guys had gotten into an area they were they were partnered up with the the the Peshmurga which are the who are the guys that occurred on the Kurds I went over to trade at and became the command master chief there and then started you know preparing to make making sure all the fundamentals that you'd stayed in place were still there and they were still there the guys were just really hard and doing a good job and then and that was it over running unit level training and and seeing that and then work in myself out of a job getting the the guy that's my replacement set up to take my job and and here's the deal like as I leave naval special warfare they're so good to go and I see the younger guys now that are coming up at every level if people like to complain about the millennials and I really don't see any issue with them because they're doing good but you're going to now like you know what's up you know what you're doing you know what you're stepping into and now retirement you could know I think so I'm really excited but 30 years is a long enough time to where I'm like I'm ready to go. and then I saw a guy running out and snatched up a little body and he's just whaling I thought you know I thought about my kids at home and what those people are going through and how awful it must be and how we just got a redouble our efforts to stop this freaking crap that was going on with ISIL because it is just so unsat because little kids are little kids you know wherever they're from or what it you know and to see innocent shattered like that was rough And yeah, you know, when, uh, when faculty died, like, um, last year, and I was like, the what I felt like all that, yeah, I just felt like all that memory, all that memory, that he had of us is gone. oh he has the experience to make this happen under massively stressful situation so my word to the senior listed guys like you're the action arm this the task commander can't make things happen he's got to he's got to look at what else is going on he's got to figure what the next step is going to be he's talking getting information he's passing information all that stuff is going to he can't take time to go. so when one of their e5s went over and talk to a Marine Corps E5 they were really cool with them they didn't manage their own security like the Marines did security around their camp they would bring dinner out to the guys that were standing watch at night just like it was it was awesome and then everybody there was just you know a real real sense of teamwork and stuff out there so that was good and that that was but you guys did some real tough fighting inside of Mosul Connected to the fact that I wanted you guys to be ready and just you know like the whole down down man thing like it's not easy to carry a down man especially not easy when the guy helps you and he kind of it's in training he kind of jumps up on your shoulder and push his hand in that right spot on your back to stabilize himself and all those little things that they do to help each other out it's not that easy it sucks and. And then we had a scorpion on it and it said like 2008 after you know it had like a label marketing brand marketing like you know made made here in Afghanistan or whatever and so. when I last time I had Jordan Peterson on because he lays out this thing about how the government the government trying to control the pricing of some kind of pelth some kind of pelth and if the government raises the prices every hunter goes and but go goes and gets all these pelts and in terms of into the government and then the government what do they have now an excess of pelts and so now what do they do with them all they don't do anything because there's nothing to do with them because they they don't they don't need it and his whole cycle unfolds where things just don't work with centralized command and things like dora the explorer and the Disney princesses and Thomas the tank engine and all these Mikey and the dragons these things are going to spread and those evil bastards what do they do to try and stop you know what do they do they try and control anything any any form of freedom and especially freedom of speech you know controlling the internet all those things and it's disturbing to see And then we got up and there's no fighting like we're going to cause it keeps us like you get to set in your watch by like okay sons up Bro this isn't just like this isn't just me and there's some guys that did didn't like me you know or whatever it's like it's not just me they're getting coerced and forced into those situations you know that's that's what's actually happening like you said sure is there one out of a thousand that's like so brainwashed that they're like And I was like going to a haunted house and like I enjoy going to haunted houses because I like to go through and something startles me Like you want to just like, okay, let's you know, it's like my my youngest daughter. one of our mutual friends that has a seat pad machine and his wife was like you know when you when you mask comes off you know I'm trying to wake you up so you can put it back on and he's like don't you know don't just leave me alone and then there was some of the stuff where the ISIL had gotten so hysterical with something there was a video they there's one of those you know like do those horrible videos and it was something happened over in Syria and they released a video where they you know they killed like nine guys but they were from the local area and But it just, it's like, I guess it's like so real, you know, like these are things you kind of deal with. hey we're going to listen to these three podcasts and mylay was one of them the other one was steel my soldier's hearts which was an awesome podcast and awesome lessons and they're all awesome lessons but it was all good because guys listen to it and we have discussions and then you know you came in and we've ETC and talked to them and that was such good stuff but go around down that road and then being in all these different situations at the executive level levels of leaderships and the seal teams and I could see in real time I'm like and we're like our admin agai is like hey what step one he goes down he goes all right we need to do this what step two we need to do this there's no way we would remember that we went through it went through the steps one of the things that that i was pretty adamant about is because i had a good idea although i haven't experienced it directly about what my guys had gone through that were there with him You know sleep and diet are a lynch pin like sleep diet and exercise there's three pillars of good health probably is there fourth pillar probably like hypnosis or I don't know those are the big three I would say and getting that sleep fixed up. and you know that's and again that's what that's the kind of thing that that you know there's there's like there's a lot I'm not saying America's a perfect place because it is not but that kind of do you hear a story like that I don't know no you're a new guy you're like I'm going to act like my platoon chief that's what I'm going to do and that's what you do And I kept it real professional with him and then he's like hey we don't know where we're going to put you we don't know what we're going to do with you guys we're working through that. I know that like one of the times that I got to go out to the to the uh to the to basically the flat with our guys who are going advising the system they would be about three blocks back or four blocks back from the front lines um the civilians that live in Mosul would just move away from where the fighting was and then just kind of mingle around just outside of it and then go back to their houses so we were at this this one location where the the guys were providing support to the Iraqi CTS and we had snipers up on rooftops were able to see all the way to front lines and take shots like oh our western culture and lifestyle is going to get overrun negative because western culture on the whole while you said it's not perfect it's still the best thing going and it is completely contagious and even over there in Iraq and in a school that was controlled by ISIL their little kids are looking at the Disney princesses and door of the explorer and you know that stuff western things because it's good it's appealing and that gave me that gave me a tremendous amount of hope We went out to the to the well I the guys were going out to the flood every day I got an opportunity to go out with them another time when they were right on the edges of of Mosul going into it and the building that they were occupying was a school and one thing I noticed as I was walking through the buildings of the school is that on the walls of the school like okay inside the classrooms had all the Disney princesses door of the explorer all the stuff that our kids enjoy there And once it once the task you got good you they you couldn't even stop because it's because it's 40 guys against four or five as you know the training that's training guys are it's like four or five guys out there shooting them up. And then the other thing is like, when you hear some rumor, whatever about something, go inside ways, and you get all freaked out because you want to be like back where you can help and you got guys going on deployment. and they got into an area that was just too laden with iedees and they were having to back up their uh their mat v the truck they were driving in and Jason had the door open so he could make sure that he was in the same tire tracks of that he'd just driven over unfortunately they'd driven over a cross plate once it crushed it halfway they hit the rest of the cross plate and uh it was a daisy change of explosives it went off you know bunch of it hit him right in the face it was a fairly horrible experience for our guys that were there because he was still breathing biologically he was alive for like the hour that they were with them before they could finally get a mat of act to him that was too hot the mat of act wouldn't come in so they had to offload him off the truck get him in the back of a pickup truck and then drive through all this heavy fire and a lot more iedees to get him on on uh onboard uh the mat of act Hey they've got some issues I don't know about that we could help them out with or we're not doing everything correctly and so I got I took that stuff that I learned from you know like Danny Carroll and Steve Hines and Monty Tree size and started to apply it outside of just a platoon level but to a command level. and I like you actually I think it seemed like a good dude I'm just saying like. And all of a sudden we realized we were going to run out of batteries like we just didn't have enough batteries so we just went to like hey carry an extra battery and if you know it fed dies then whatever change it. You know blaming you guys are making excuses like okay let's make a list and we knocked out like four things that we messed up the worst four things that we messed up. It's more just like a just a session of but it was because when we got done with some podcast early on, it was like being drugged through like the emotional freaking hell. I'm like hey when my guys make chief we have to put them through all this training a lot of the training I don't think is good one of the things I did for them is like and so like I don't know you know if you're listening to this in your situation someone's going something horrible and you don't know what to say. so man then I started looking at labels getting smart picked up a book read it on basically you know how I eat now is is round about a paleo thing like I try to avoid grains and carbohydrates and stuff that's processed laughing because the other day you're like yeah that's in just our culture and way of life moving forward that's the whole idea of months ago when I had said that oh you want to solve the problem in North Korea give those people iPhones so they can start watching YouTube because you want to couple YouTube videos and you look around that you're you know bear in neighborhood where you're eating like a water with salt and it is your dinner and you watch a YouTube video of people eating steaks and McDonald's and Subway and you think yourself the something's not right here Two of us are a lot alike personality wise which we really you know like we went to a couple of leadership seminars and you're like you guys are almost the same person They just they just told us there's like here's what here's here's we laid out here's our capabilities and there's like well here's how we'd like to use you and we said Roger that where can we help we never came in and said. oh we're gonna stay here like don't they know that we almost got hammered like this is the first time. Yeah, so it's kind of the most complicated thing to write the thing that's hard to handle is the thing that you didn't plan for and so if you don't have it's just like it's just like you don't want to commit your reserves right you don't want to commit your reserves. And then my boss like I don't know how he got shot he didn't get shot but the two commanders like all right This will give you like the training training, you know, it will allow you to make mistakes in an online training or do the wrong thing and then get correct as a hey, you did this, you know, kind of, yeah. And as soon as everyone we're heading south we're getting out of here going to our old rally point as soon as everyone knows that they just make it happen and do you come in or can do whatever he wants to do because the fire team leaders are going to make things happen themselves and and then and the opposite of that is there's no possible way you can control these people if you have to tell them everything that you want to do you can't say hey you can't talk to all those people at the same time you can't know what the vantage point the best vantage point for us to 60 gunners. And the only difference is and you could say that there's some difference in the guys but they're really not there's actually like the seals in the butoon they're good they're solid they're fine there's a couple knuckleheads there's a couple great guys there's a couple guys there's guys in the middle but that's not the difference the difference is so blatantly clear the leadership that you just get to see that over and over and over again some this awesome. I showed him to my brother and he's like, he's like, man, I'm kind of like tearing up. You just it just and then get guess what then you end up with a bunch of new guys that are all arrogant because they're all just imitating you know they're all imitating the senior guys there's not a new guy that checks into a team goes you know what my chief seems a little bit arrogant I'm going to be more humble. You know in law showing up for Christmas like Randy Quaid and Christmas story and then now we were like hey old college buddies that had come into town and third group was just so good to us. In like six hours so it's you got to like go and say hey you four guys get in there and I need you to take sleep so you're ready to bump out on the security positions or the fighting positions or whatever it is. and like I said that one point in swell like I or I'm like It before it just comes out and then so anyways you're going to like Twitter because you can use your little one liners which you are very very good at and they're always like I said they're always very educational or humorous or they at least make you think so you'll have fun with that and don't feed the trolls and don't feed the Russian bots. And what about I know you told me a story one time about you guys weren't in the high ground here somebody that there's somebody like a cross about that had a little elevation on you and you guys were digging in and digging in and digging in sandbags and bags and bags much too good. And you know, especially for guys like you and me and you know, you even 10, I mean, I was in for 20 years, you were in for 30, but I mean, how many memories do you have at the Seal Team 1 grinder, at the Seal Team 3 grinder, at the trade at building?
