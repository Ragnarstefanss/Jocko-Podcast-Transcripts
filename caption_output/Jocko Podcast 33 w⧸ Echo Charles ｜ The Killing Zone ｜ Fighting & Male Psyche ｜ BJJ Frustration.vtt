00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 33 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Good evening, echo.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Good evening.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
People say there is a line.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There's a line between good and evil, right and wrong,

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
between light and dark.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And that's a nice, clean way to think of things.

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But the line can be hard to recognize.

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It can get blurry.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It can get twisted by emotion and passion and by one's own ego.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And in war, that line is tested.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's pressed.

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It becomes even more blurry.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It gets crossed and violated,

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and sometimes abandoned.

16
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And we can see that throughout history,

17
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we've talked about it here in the Japanese slave camps in Rwanda,

18
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and me lie.

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Those are a few examples, but there are thousands of them.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I've seen the line.

21
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And I've seen men approach the line.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Driven, filled with fury and with hate.

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that fury needs an outlet.

24
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And if it gets a purchase,

25
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
it can become unstoppable.

26
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But it can also be controlled.

27
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Because there is a counter to all that evil.

28
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There is the man that steps up and says, no.

29
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
No, not today, not here, not now.

30
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We will not do that.

31
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the dichotomy of leadership and the dichotomy of war is so hard to balance.

32
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The soldiers are trained and tasked to kill.

33
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And yet they are also trained to be humane and fair and moral and good.

34
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So how does a warrior reconcile those opposing forces?

35
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
How do we know how to be?

36
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000
How does he know to balance?

37
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
God damn!

38
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Thoughts rush through my mind as I try to decide what to do.

39
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Women, old men, and kids, obviously non-combatants.

40
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But this is a free fire zone.

41
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
There are not supposed to be civilians in this area.

42
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But dinks occasionally ignore those warnings about free fire areas.

43
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Maybe they are the point element for Viet Kong or NVA traveling behind them.

44
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Maybe they are supposed to give the warning if stopped.

45
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It's happened before.

46
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In that case, some of my men could come under fire and be killed or wounded.

47
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Four or six killed that one tank last evening and he had a Thompson.

48
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
There was a whole squad of Kong in that group.

49
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There was some incoming fire when we made the LZ.

50
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
A dink tried to cross the dark last night.

51
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
These people look innocent enough.

52
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
They may be carrying supplies for the Kong and the area, food and or ammo.

53
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's a free fire zone.

54
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Everyone is supposed to be considered enemy.

55
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I'm responsible for my men.

56
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
They'll get killed if I make the wrong decision.

57
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
These dinks coming toward us mean nothing to me.

58
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
My men mean everything.

59
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
What if the dinks aren't innocent?

60
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
My men depend on me to keep them alive.

61
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I spoke softly to the men around me.

62
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It's a lick on them.

63
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
When I give the order, open fire.

64
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I brought up the M16 to sight in on the dinks.

65
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Spag was standing to my right. His M60 machine gun supported on his hip by a sling around his neck and shoulder.

66
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
He reached over and touched my arm.

67
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
His whispered voice reflected the agony of doubt in his face.

68
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
No, sir, you can't.

69
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Kids, women.

70
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
He motioned toward the file of people coming towards us.

71
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I felt ashamed.

72
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Spag was right.

73
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Wait one. I whispered to the men around me.

74
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I'll call for them to surrender.

75
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I felt relieved.

76
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Capturing them was the best solution.

77
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
If they were the point for a VC group,

78
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I would just make sure none of us was exposed to fire when we captured this point.

79
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The dinks were almost to the intersection.

80
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I stepped through the brush with some of my men.

81
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Dung, really? Dung, Louis, I warned. They were only 10 to 20 meters from us. They all glanced at us, standing with our weapons trained on them.

82
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We had them dead to rights. They had no cover of no place to run to.

83
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A perfect capture situation.

84
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Almost in mid-strived, they all moved with astonishing speed.

85
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The two boys in the point split up.

86
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
The one ran past us heading down the trail past the schoolhouse.

87
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The other boy, the woman, the old men, started running back toward the bridge.

88
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Stop, stop, Dung, Louis. I yelled to no avail.

89
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I could not order the men to run after them. It could be a trap.

90
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Neither could I let them get away. Why would they running?

91
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In the split second, those thoughts ran across my consciousness.

92
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I gave the order to open fire.

93
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
An irrevocable wave of death swept in front of us.

94
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
After the initial burst of gunfire, I yelled cease fire.

95
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
The two women survived long enough to cross the bridge and enter one of the hooches.

96
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Three of my men crossed over the bridge and threw grenades in the hooches.

97
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
We heard lead looked over the bodies on the trail, since they were lying in the open.

98
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We had no desire to be caught exposed.

99
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The men reported that some of the dead had been carrying hand grenades in their ammo and ammo packs.

100
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I felt someone relieved. Those supplies could have been for anyone but the Kong.

101
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I received a report from the squad down the trail.

102
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The firing had alerted them, barely fast enough to fire at the teenager running toward them down the trail.

103
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Someone hit him in the shoulder and knocked him down, surprisingly the boy had jumped up and run past the squad to safety somewhere in the brush.

104
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I had no pleasure in reporting to Delta 6 that we had killed six dinks and one wounded.

105
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I knew he would ask how many weapons we had captured.

106
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I stared at the gray horizon for a long time before answering that the dinks were not carrying weapons, only supplies and grenades.

107
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I felt low. This putrid war.

108
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I thought of so many ways I could have done it differently.

109
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So easy to think afterward.

110
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
After all, now I knew there was no dink squad behind on the trail.

111
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This episode would be the darkest of my career.

112
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I called my men together for a march up the slight hill to Delta 6's position, forcing the dinks out of my mind.

113
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
That's from a book that we're looking at tonight.

114
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It's called the killing zone.

115
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
My life in the Vietnam War by Frederick Downs.

116
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now Vietnam, it was a hard war, obviously a wretched war for many reasons.

117
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And the Meal Eye Masterker is almost the apex, almost the pinnacle.

118
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It almost seems like the essence of the war in many respects.

119
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
At least it's viewed that way.

120
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And it did have a huge strategic impact. It was devastating to the war effort.

121
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And something that should always be remembered is that tactical operations can have strategic impact.

122
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Like Hacworth said, the Meal Eye Masterker probably did more to end the war and hasten our departure from Vietnam than anything our communist enemy did.

123
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And in a similar vein, the war I was in, in the mistreatment of the prisoners in Abu Greb, prison in Iraq and the photographs that showed that mistreatment,

124
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
likely did more to fuel the insurgency in that country than anything Al Qaeda did.

125
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Tactical actions can have strategic impact.

126
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that actually happens in business too.

127
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.000
One bad customer experience for a customer that's got some reach and there can really be a strategic impact.

128
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And what the front line troops do really does matter and what the front line troops do is based on how they are led.

129
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Clearly in Meal Eye there was a total lack of leadership,

130
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
especially from the moral and ethical perspective.

131
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But this was not the norm, not by any stretch.

132
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And like I said, it's viewed sometimes as the representation of what the Vietnam war was like, but it's not.

133
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And I said this when we talked about Meal Eye, yeah America has done monstrous things in our history.

134
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
But we most certainly are not monstrous.

135
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We are an amazingly benevolent nation, especially now, perhaps even to our own detriment.

136
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
But that's why I wanted to talk about this book, the killing zone, to show the challenges of Vietnam war,

137
00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000
how American troops handled those challenges and pressures on a day-to-day basis, and how they sometimes cross that line,

138
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
if only for a moment.

139
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But then most of the time brought themselves back from the brink of darkness into the light.

140
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now let's go back to the book here.

141
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Going to the beginning when Fred Downs, young lieutenant in the army, is flying in the Vietnam.

142
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.000
At 23, 30 hours, the continental Big Bird with a Golden Tail DC8 dropped through the night sky into the landing pattern over the black landscape of Vietnam.

143
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
23 hours earlier, 165 of us had been crammed aboard the commercial jet at the airport near San Francisco.

144
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I looked around the cabin at the officer and at the officers and enlisted men who had come from all over the United States to catch his flight from San Francisco.

145
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
How would they return?

146
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
How would I return?

147
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I had graduated six months earlier from the US Army's OCS Program at Fort Benning, Georgia, and now I would soon to be leading men in the combat.

148
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I was 23 years old and I had been trained to lead.

149
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Physically, I thought I was ready.

150
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Mentally, I was as confident of myself as any young officer could be.

151
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But underneath my confidence, were the ever present questions, worry, and curiosity about war and my role in it.

152
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I was eagerly looking forward to finding answers.

153
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I would not have to wait long.

154
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So we've talked about that before.

155
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
When you're stepping into a leadership role, you're not going to.

156
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
There's a good chance you're not going to feel 100% confident.

157
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And that's okay.

158
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So he gets to Vietnam.

159
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
He gets assigned to fourth division.

160
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And he actually hadn't heard of fourth division.

161
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
He hadn't seen it in the papers.

162
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
He kind of asked, hey, why?

163
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Why have I seen it in the papers?

164
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
What are they doing?

165
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And he said, there's no reporters up there where they're working.

166
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
It's too rough for him.

167
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And he's kind of saying, you know, I want to get, I want to make sure I get it on.

168
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And some of the old timers are telling him, one of them says,

169
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
you'll get a belly full of fighting up there, son, if that's what you want.

170
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So it's one of those.

171
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Be careful with you wish for scenarios.

172
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And I thought this was pretty pretty interesting.

173
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You know, we talk about hack worth and the hardcore recondos

174
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
as the salute and reply.

175
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The reply is no fucking slack.

176
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So here's what they had here.

177
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
It was SOP to salute in the company area, but not in the field.

178
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
When in the list of man saluted, he would say golden dragon sir.

179
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
The officer would return the salute with right of the line.

180
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I asked about this.

181
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They told me that at that the first the 14th, that's the division he's with.

182
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The first the 14th was an old infantry regiment steeped in tradition.

183
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
During the box rebellion in China, the unit had fought bravely.

184
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Afterwards they adopted the symbol of a golden dragon.

185
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
The other part of the salute came from some battle in the civil war.

186
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Right before a large battle, a staff officer asked a general where to put the first to the 14th.

187
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The general had roared back, put them to the right of the line where they belong.

188
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
The right of the line is where a leader traditionally puts his best men and units.

189
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
This comes down through military history, when a man fought with the shield and sword.

190
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
The right arm or sword arm was unprotected.

191
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
The best fighter was put to the right to protect the sword arm of the man on his left.

192
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Only the most trusted and best fighters held the position to the right.

193
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Legit.

194
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So he's there in the head quarters area for a little while and then he gets his indoctrination and then gets flown out.

195
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000
He flies out into the field into where he's going to be operating out of.

196
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
He gets up there and this is straight out of a movie right here.

197
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Bugs swarmed around my face.

198
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I swatted and looked at the men who looked right back at me.

199
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It was my first view of American GIs who had spent several days in the jungle.

200
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I stood there in sparkling crisp fatigues, brand new boots, new rifle, clean shaving, fresh haircut.

201
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I even smelled the clean.

202
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
My helmet camouflage cover didn't have a mark on it nor did I.

203
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The two men opposite me were filthy.

204
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
They're fatigues were torn and they had scratches all over their skin two or three days of growth on their beard and dark circles under their eyes.

205
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
They looked tired and they smelled the high heaven.

206
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So that's right out of a movie.

207
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
The boot, Lieutenant coming in to take over.

208
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
He's in his pressed cam.

209
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
He's looking all square away and these guys look like they're living in hell.

210
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And they introduced the company commander in this guy.

211
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
You're going to see throughout the book.

212
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
This guy captain sells was an ROTC officer 26 years old son of a father killed in Korea.

213
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So that's, you know, the guy's dad got killed in Korea and he's during the Vietnam war he's joined it up and leading men in the company.

214
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
He's a company commander.

215
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And if you remember from the book, the book, the two leader, you remember he didn't even meet the company commander.

216
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So his direct boss didn't even meet him for weeks.

217
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
He'd been in the field for weeks before even met him.

218
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And here's this company commander obviously much more square away.

219
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Walks him around.

220
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
The introduces and everybody's giving him a heads up.

221
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You know, this is the way it's supposed to be.

222
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And, you know, he's getting told, look, there's enemy all around.

223
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And you might have heard in that intro piece that I read.

224
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I was talking about Delta 6 and here's a little piece about that.

225
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
He informed me that his radio signal was Delta 6.

226
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
So that's the Delta company commander's Delta 6.

227
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Lieutenant smart, the first, but two leader was Delta 1 6.

228
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
The second, but two leader was Delta 2 6.

229
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
This is what the commanders of the unit.

230
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
And this is a tradition that holds true in the army and the Marine Corps today.

231
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And it's pretty cool when you're in the field.

232
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
You'd hear someone call for the six.

233
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And that means we want to talk to the guys that's in charge out there.

234
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Their seconds of command were known as Fives.

235
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
For instance, Delta 1 5 was the first Petune Sergeant.

236
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And this is, you know, goes on to talk a little bit more about Captain Cells,

237
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
who's asking about his family.

238
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
He's getting to know him.

239
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
He's got a little bit of a down's hat.

240
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I had a wife and two little girls back in Illinois.

241
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And so again, you're getting an impression that Cells is a guy that's trying to get to know his people and learn about him, which is the way a leader.

242
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What a leader should be doing.

243
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Now these guys are out.

244
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And he's talking again.

245
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
This is something straight out of a straight out of a movie.

246
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Darkness quickly engulfed us.

247
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Watched in astonishment as I pulled out mosquito netting and spread it over my poncho liner and air mattress.

248
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
They were a gas that I carried so much extra weight.

249
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
No, I answered, this is all the good stuff.

250
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Their amazement grew as I revealed three changes of underwear and fatigued clothes.

251
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Wait until the next day they scoffed when the sun and heavy pack will drag me down.

252
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
The jungle would exact a toll for every outside carried.

253
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We'll see, I answered.

254
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Not a good answer.

255
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Lieutenant smart said, yeah, you'll see.

256
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
You'll see that the only change to clothes your carias and being an extra pair of socks.

257
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
You'll learn to live in one set of jungle fatigues until they rot off you or rip too badly to wear.

258
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000
That actually reminds me when we were in my first deployment to Iraq, we had three sets of camis and just warm, rotated them.

259
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
In Ramadi, the uptempo was so high and the conditions of fighting.

260
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
We had to order new camis within a couple weeks of being their guys had destroyed.

261
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Camis could run across the street, they're getting, you know, dragging people and they were just ruining their their camis.

262
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So that was another indicator in Ramadi that we were in a totally different scenario than I was on my first deployment to Iraq.

263
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Back to the book.

264
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
My first days on combat control combat patrol introduced me to the visitutes of war.

265
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Ten foot deep, pungy pits.

266
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Wait a minute vines that collected around the feet and legs until their combined strength stopped you and you had to say, wait a minute while you untangled or cut yourself loose.

267
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
The hot sun beating down us on us as we march around with 70 pound packs.

268
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
The sweat pouring office, the bugs so thick are faces that around our faces that we sometimes inhaled them.

269
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
That and the physical agony of forcing tired muscles to keep going.

270
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It was a search and destroy mission which meant we searched all the hooches we found and then burned them down.

271
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Whether a single farmer's hooch or a whole village all were burnt.

272
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
The few Vietnamese we found in the area were women, children, and old men who had been left behind.

273
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
When we started to burn their particular hooch, they would start wailing, crying and pulling in our clothes.

274
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
We didn't harm the people, but the orders were to destroy all the dwellings so we did.

275
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:47.000
The first time I saw a Vietnamese family going to hysterics when their hooch was set on fire, I was unsure of whether burning their home would accomplish our mission.

276
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
The mission was to deny the enemy use of the hooches to destroy any food we found and to teach the people a lesson about supporting the enemy.

277
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
But I quickly got used to it and accepted that this was one way to win the war.

278
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And that's, if you talk to anybody, anybody knowledgeable about true counter insurgency, this is not a great plan to go in and basically abuse the populist.

279
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Now if you know that they're supporting the insurgence, sure you want to disrupt that.

280
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
But oftentimes they're not supporting the insurgence because they want to, they're supporting the insurgence because they're fearful of the lives.

281
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
That's the way it was in Iraq when I was there.

282
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:46.000
So back to the book, Sholden Brand took the opportunity later that day to explain in this unit everyone called the enemy and ultimately all outsiders dinks.

283
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
So that's their word that they use.

284
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And I found this interesting. He says, ultimately all outsiders and you've revert me and you've heard lay from in the book, we talk about moves.

285
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
That's what we call the enemy, we call the enemy moves. But what's interesting is here it says all outsiders and that's exactly what we did.

286
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000
If when we were getting resistance from, you know, up the chain of command down the chain of command, guess what we call them.

287
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Moosh, we'd say all the bosses saying this can't believe that moves. So it became the word that we used to, to all outsiders.

288
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And that's that's the unit cohesion and there's some dehumanization of the enemy there obviously.

289
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:32.000
But the fact that you end up using the same slang word to describe anybody that's against you is is is is interesting.

290
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Back to the book, it turned out that the enemy started calling us dinks first because it was an insulting or demeaning term that meant hairy man from the jungle.

291
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
We had just turned the word around and started calling them dinks. At least that was the story.

292
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I don't know if that's true or not. I never never read didn't do any research on that one.

293
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I saw the face of the enemy for the first time. He'd been machine gunned down by one of our gun crews. The powerful weapon in throwing a halo bullets in the brush where we had spotted him.

294
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000
When we got to his position, I saw for the first time the death of a soldier. The machine gun crew had done a good job.

295
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000
The young soldiers, green combat uniform body was riddled with bullets. He was sprawled across his bicycle with his face toward the sky.

296
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:22.000
And last I had before me the enemy had been trained to destroy. He was a young man for whom the war and life had ended.

297
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
One evening a jet was returning to base and needed a target to get rid of his unexpected bomb load.

298
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000
The captain called the forward air controller and gave him the coordinates of a sniper 300 meters away who'd been pestering us off and on for three days.

299
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
As the jet pulled up after dropping the sniper's position, we could hear the pop pop of the sniper firing at the jet.

300
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
The men talked about the goal of that sniper as I watched the Napalm burn itself out.

301
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I wondered what would drive a man to stand up to death in so remarkable manner.

302
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Again you're dealing with a hardened enemy. You're getting Napalm dropped on your position.

303
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And as you burn to death, you're trying to shoot down a jet fighter.

304
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Back to the book, Shaldenbrand was worth his weight and gold to me in running that platoon.

305
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
He even introduced me to the platoon motto. It's a lick.

306
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
A lick is a lick on a young man's ass lieutenant.

307
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
You remember when you were a kid and you did something wrong or something got fucked up that you got the blame for?

308
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
The old man would give you a lick in with a switch or a belt?

309
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Yeah, I sure remember getting lickings.

310
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Well when something goes wrong, it's a lick on you. You see anything that goes wrong will give you a lick.

311
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
And over here you'll get plenty of licks.

312
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
My RTO was the other most important man to the platoon.

313
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
His job was carried the radio and stick to me like a shadow.

314
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
The radio was our link with literally everything outside our platoon from supplies to survival.

315
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Without a working radio and a good RTO, a platoon leader and the platoon was good as lost in this war.

316
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
My RTO man, a skinny kid, five feet 11 inches tall, was next to perfect for his job.

317
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
He loved to know what was going on and his job was akin to the central switchboard operators.

318
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
So that's the RTO. That was actually when I was an enlisted seal. That's what I was.

319
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I always had that same attitude. When you're the RTO, you always know what's going on.

320
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Because the officer's telling you you're right next to him, you're listening to what he's saying to you always know what's going on.

321
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And that was a real good education for me.

322
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Growing my whole career always being next to the guy that was running the platoon.

323
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Talking a little bit about the troops here.

324
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
My squad leaders were first squad, Delcatol Cowboy type from Wyoming, second squad porter, a slightly built black from East St. Louis.

325
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Third squad Jose, a skinny, short, swarthey port, Recon, fourth squad Gallagher, a medium built redhead from New England states.

326
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
And of course, there was the platoon medic dock.

327
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000
The platoon make-up was white, black's port, Recon's Mexicans, Americans and in Indian.

328
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
And a Japanese American. All of them from 18 to 21 years old.

329
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
In a combat platoon, we were evaluated by our peers on our ability to help the platoon survive and not on our racial movement.

330
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And not on our racial backgrounds.

331
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
A combat platoon pulled together and was tight with each other with no room for the soldier who wouldn't do his share.

332
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
So it's always good to just point that out.

333
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
These are just people from across section of America.

334
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
And these are pretty stereotypical, right?

335
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Cowboy from Wyoming.

336
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
This is stereotypical stuff.

337
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And that's one thing that the military says.

338
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
So when I joined, I grew up in New England, right?

339
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
When I joined the Navy and I got to California.

340
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000
And I went to the enlisted man's club on NAB Coronado, the Gator Gardens back in the day.

341
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000
I was 18 years old, and I showed up, you know, because there's a club.

342
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
So it's a club on base, right?

343
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And so I go, I'm going to go there.

344
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
People say, hey, we're going to go to the club.

345
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
So I go, okay, well, let's go see what's going on there.

346
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
So I walk over the club.

347
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And as I'm kind of standing outside, I see two guys walk by with with jeans on with cowboy boots,

348
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
with big belt buckles and cowboy hats and like a Wrangler shirt.

349
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And I was kind of thinking myself, oh, that's there.

350
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Is there some kind of, is it Halloween?

351
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Is that these guys getting dressed up for something?

352
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And again, this is pre-internet, man.

353
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I mean, and, and, and then I see a couple more guys going to turn out.

354
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
It was countrywester night, but at the club that you went.

355
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I had never seen a person in, you know, I come from a small town in Connecticut.

356
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
And there's, there's just no cowboys up there.

357
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And in, and interestingly, there's farms and there's people that raise cattle and there's people that grow,

358
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
you know, have, have farms, but they don't have cowboy boots.

359
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And they don't want a cowboy hats.

360
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And so it's just, that's what I was thinking about when I read this is just how you take all these

361
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
different people from all of this, but they had no idea.

362
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
You have no idea what other people are like.

363
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000
And again, this is pre-internet.

364
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
You know, when I joined the Navy, we didn't get to Google.

365
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000
We didn't watch YouTube videos because you're exposed the entire planet and, and galaxy through YouTube.

366
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Hmm.

367
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
First time you saw a real cowboy, huh?

368
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Hmm.

369
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
It is.

370
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I thought, I thought they were, I thought they were dressed up.

371
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Yeah.

372
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
It is kind of crazy.

373
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And then, you know, I ended up, I mean, in, in, in, in, to you, brooder, we had all kinds of guys from Texas.

374
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And there's all kinds of cowboys down in Texas.

375
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Uh, but like, I'm in Chris, Chris Kyle was like a legit, whatever, rodeo, dude in life.

376
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Laced a cowboy.

377
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Laced an absolute cowboy.

378
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Yeah, absolutely.

379
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I mean, there's all kinds of cowboys in there.

380
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
So, uh, now we, we're going to advance a little bit.

381
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
This is the first time that that downs is actually in charge.

382
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Um, he did a little turnover with the, with the former Patoon commander.

383
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
He takes charge of Patoon.

384
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000
And he's doing security for the bridges for some bridges that are out kind of away from the main camp.

385
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And they're out there to prevent landmines and gather intel and kind of set up a checkpoint.

386
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
And, and they're, they're, they're actually staying out there. So they would, they would set up by these bridges.

387
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
And as they're getting set up for the first time, I'm going to the book.

388
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
In explosion, rip the air behind me, fall immediately by a scream.

389
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
My body instinctively threw myself against the sandbags, is my mind shouted, morder attack.

390
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
My eyes register the scene of men frozen and shocked Wonderman.

391
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Their eyes staring behind me.

392
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Man was directly in front of me.

393
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
And the track man were off in the background, crouching where they,

394
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
where they were when the explosions went off.

395
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
So they're actually out there with some tracked vehicles.

396
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Quickly turning around, my eyes swept an awful catastrophe.

397
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
One of the claimors had gone off shattering for over the lives of the three men in front of it.

398
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Jesus Christ, was it a murder?

399
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
No, one of our claimors went off.

400
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Get those men quick.

401
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
No, no, no, wait.

402
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
There's another claimor out there.

403
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
What the fuck said it off?

404
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
What about the other one?

405
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So imagine this.

406
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
You get to a position and you want to put out claimor minds.

407
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And if you don't know what a claimor mind is, it's a, it's a directional blasting mind that you set off by command detonations.

408
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So you have a little, a little thing that you squeeze.

409
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
And when you squeeze this thing, it sends electrical charge down the wire into the claimor,

410
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
detonates a blasting cap, the, the claimor explodes and everything in front of it's going to die.

411
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Well, they had set up the claimors and then they were going to put some barbed wire out.

412
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And as they were putting the barbed wire out, there was a storm, electrical storm, you know,

413
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
a thunderstorm and the static electricity in the air actually set off the claimor.

414
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
So it killed or it, it did some serious damage.

415
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Back to the book.

416
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Only a few seconds had passed since the explosion.

417
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
One of my men and I dashed to the other claimor, frantically fumbling on screwing the plug and holding the basting cap,

418
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
throwing it away from the claimor.

419
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Then I rushed back to the radio.

420
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Two men were applying first aid.

421
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
The other positions were covered by the men assigned to them.

422
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
They had stayed in place during the action.

423
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Good training.

424
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
I thought as I fumbled with my map.

425
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It was folded into plastic radio bag.

426
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
All of us used to carry maps in.

427
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Delta six.

428
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
This is one six over one six.

429
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
This is Delta six over.

430
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
This is one six.

431
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I need dust off.

432
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
There's been an accident resulting in three peanuts over.

433
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
We tried to say nothing over the radio that could be understood by the enemy.

434
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Thus, we used code words for certain things.

435
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
A cool aid was a dead soldier and a peanut was a wounded soldier.

436
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
This is Delta six.

437
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
What the hell happened over?

438
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
This is one six.

439
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Static electricity in the air set off a claimor while three trackmen were putting out barbed wire over.

440
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
This is Delta six.

441
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
What's your position?

442
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Over.

443
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Now what would he ask me that for?

444
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
I was on the bridge he'd assigned to me.

445
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Let's see.

446
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
We're here.

447
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
I read right enough.

448
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Real easy.

449
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Just like all the training.

450
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
So he's looking at his map.

451
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Try to figure out where he is.

452
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Of course, that was my first responsibility.

453
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Where a men had been hurt.

454
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So maybe that accounted for what happened next in spite of training.

455
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Lieutenant Lieutenant.

456
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
You've got to get a dust off out here quick.

457
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
This man's got a bad head wound.

458
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Said one soldier as they brought the wounded over me.

459
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Dirty black clouds with lightning crashing around.

460
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Added the confusion as the wind howled over from all directions.

461
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Huge range drops started to spatter down.

462
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
This is one six.

463
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
I'm at coordinates two nine eight zero two eight over.

464
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
I read them out.

465
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
This is Delta six.

466
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Are you sure of that over?

467
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
This is one six.

468
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Let's see.

469
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yeah.

470
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
It's that's it.

471
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
All right.

472
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
There.

473
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.000
One six.

474
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
You better check that again.

475
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
According to what you gave me.

476
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
You're in the South China Sea over.

477
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Oh, did he sound mad?

478
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
God damn.

479
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I've done this a million times.

480
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
The fought ran through my mind as a sweat broke out.

481
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
The wounded were groaning.

482
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
The storm was reaching gigantic proportions.

483
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
And the track sergeant was demanding.

484
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And nowhere that fuck that dust off was concentrate.

485
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Front concentrate.

486
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I said to myself while staring at the meaningless blob of colors,

487
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
worlds and numbers.

488
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
So he's looking at his map.

489
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
It's just trying to figure it out.

490
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Suddenly everything jelled in perfect clarity.

491
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Delta six is one six.

492
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
You're right.

493
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
My coordinates are two eight eight zero two eight.

494
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I needed dust off fast over.

495
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
One six.

496
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
This is Delta six.

497
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
I know where you are.

498
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
I just wanted to see if you could figure it out.

499
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
I already called the dust off.

500
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
So cap and cells.

501
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
This that's who he was talking to.

502
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Captain cells.

503
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
That's that's Delta six.

504
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
The commander of the company.

505
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
And even in this pressure situation.

506
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
He's trying to make sure that the guy is thinking.

507
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
He's in the opportunity to think for the first time under pressure.

508
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And he already called the dust off.

509
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
But he's still putting the test to him and seeing how he operates under that kind of stress and pressure.

510
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Another following situation.

511
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000
They're kind of sitting in this location and they see a woman start to start to approach where they had some some equipment.

512
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
And she was look like she was going to steal some stuff.

513
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And you know, it's kind of no big deal.

514
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Okay.

515
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
She's going to steal some whatever some ponchos or something.

516
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Well, then they see her what she picks up as a case of grenades.

517
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
And they're thinking.

518
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Wait a second.

519
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Now this just got really bad because if she was stealing a poncho, okay.

520
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
No big deal.

521
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
She's stealing grenades. That's stuff that's going to be used to come back and kill them.

522
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000
But again, because we have a guy with a with a conscience, you know, a guy that sees where the line of darkness is and he doesn't want to cross it.

523
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
So instead of just shooting her, which he could have done.

524
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
He loads a magazine of trace around, sent to his end to his weapon.

525
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And he starts shooting him around her kind of warning shots.

526
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And then eventually start shooting. He's a good shot.

527
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
He starts shooting at the little rope that holds the case that she's holding onto.

528
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
He starts shooting at that rope.

529
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Shoot at it like five or six time.

530
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Finally hits the rope kind of hits her hand.

531
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
She drops it.

532
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
She runs off again.

533
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Just trying to show the discretion that this guy's using as a real contrast to the me lie episode.

534
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Now speaking of that, they've little later on.

535
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
They roll up some prisoners.

536
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
One is an old man and one is a young man.

537
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
And this old gray-haired sergeant starts going after him.

538
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
They got these two prisoners. They're captured.

539
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And here's the sergeant.

540
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
So you're the fuckers that zap my buddies in the tank.

541
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
The old gray-haired sergeant snarled.

542
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
And the old man was running. He swung a heavy fist into the face of the old man knocking him down.

543
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
The other fist swung into the face of the younger man knocking him down beside the old man.

544
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
The sergeant was screaming and bellowing as he pummeled the two men on the sand.

545
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
They rolled into balls for protection, but were hampered by their tied hands.

546
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I ran from the road yelling my two men to pull the sergeant off the prisoners.

547
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
They grabbed him by his soldiers as he fought them to get back to the Vietnamese.

548
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
He lashed out with his foot at the prisoners, catching one of them in the side.

549
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
And the hell are you doing, sergeant? Those men are my prisoners I exclaimed.

550
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
His face was red with fury as he yelled back at me.

551
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
You had no right to take those stinking, cong prisoners.

552
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
He smelled of beer that he had drunk.

553
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
You should have killed those motherfuckers like they killed that other tank crew.

554
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Fuck! These men are tied up. We don't know who they are. I yelled back.

555
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I was saved by the sound of Lieutenant Knut, Knutson's voice breaking over the argument.

556
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Calm down, sergeant. Go back to your tent.

557
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
The Lieutenant was the commander of the tanks. Again,

558
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
I'm pointing this out. He's new in country. He sees somebody beat Napa Prisoner.

559
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
They had just lost one of the tanks to a mine earlier.

560
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
And obviously the gray-haired sergeant's pissed.

561
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
And he wants to take it out on these guys.

562
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000
But, you know, comers, cooler heads prevailed in that situation.

563
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Now speaking of mines, mines back to the book mines continue to be laid in the road at irregular intervals.

564
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It was a fact of life, but the terror of an explosion never failed to send a shiver through our guts no matter how many times we heard them.

565
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Whatever we were doing our heads would jerk around.

566
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
It was a terrifying to hear the explosion.

567
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
CD ugly gray and black crowd clout as it ripped into the air.

568
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000
CDark pieces of metal can't this machinery and human beings flying in the blossom of death out from the center of destruction.

569
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And this one big mine happens.

570
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And he's going to check it out. It's a truck. It's a vehicle.

571
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
I approached the twisted wreck. It was very disheartening to see the smoking wreck,

572
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
which had once been the carrier of human beings.

573
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
There were less smoke drifting upward from the Hulk.

574
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000
As we approached closer, we saw parts of the driver's body mangled beyond recognition in the cabin on the ground.

575
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000
The main portion of the driver was only recognizable because we knew that was what it was supposed to be.

576
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000
My man ran toward the still living being huddled in the rice paddy, muleing over and over that his leg was gone.

577
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
The scene of desolation brought about the true impact of the Vietnam War to me.

578
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000
There was no enemy to fire at. There was no nothing to retaliate against.

579
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000
At a distance, the traffic of vehicles and Vietnamese watched.

580
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
All that remained was the messy job of cleaning up while thinking that this could happen to us.

581
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
A small part of our mind tried to retain its sanity by reminding itself over and over.

582
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
That it would never happen to us. It could happen to everyone else, but it would not happen to me.

583
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:24.000
With that in mind, we started scraping up what was left, preparing it for the plastic body bag.

584
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Eventually, they go from guarding the bridges to where they start doing patrols out in the jungle.

585
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
An ambush is out in the jungle and direct action missions out in the jungle.

586
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
At this point, they're out in the jungle.

587
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
I'll go to the book. My platoon and I had not shaved for three or four days.

588
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Delta 6 was a bear about shaving.

589
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Combat patrol or not.

590
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Just because we lived like animals didn't mean we had to look like them.

591
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
It was his way of thinking.

592
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Throwing my fatigue jacket across a bush, I grabbed my shaving gear and told Spag and Viseanor to accompany me.

593
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
We would guard each other as we shaved.

594
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
The company commanders coming out and they're on a shaving.

595
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
They're like, okay, we got a shave real quick.

596
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
But again, you can see that Captain Selz has a real influence.

597
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And you can see that discipline.

598
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
It's carries over.

599
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
And when you let it slack and then you go visit your troops and they have to get back in line.

600
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
It brings them back to humanity.

601
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
It makes them remind them of things.

602
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Because think about it.

603
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
That shaving is something you do in the military every single day.

604
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
So when all of a sudden you're out in the field, you start losing that.

605
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
You start slipping away from that.

606
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And things start other things start slipping away as well.

607
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
They get into a, they get into some fire fights out there.

608
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
And at one point he gets wounded and I'm going to the book.

609
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
After homes had finished bandaging my arm.

610
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
I put on my fatigue jacket and let a cigarette.

611
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I felt good.

612
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
I had only been in country a few months and I had my second purple heart.

613
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
The first one had been from a wound received in October.

614
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
To top it off, I had been wounded twice in one day.

615
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Shot in the ear in the morning and hit with a grenade trapping on the afternoon.

616
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Luck was with me.

617
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
All three wounds had been slight.

618
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Now you can say luck when you get shot in the ear.

619
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
And you are lucky for sure.

620
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:35.000
But that's a real, that's a real eye opener indicating that you realize how close you were to die.

621
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And I had guys get shot in the helmet and they didn't like it one bit.

622
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Because that's real close.

623
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Someone got real close to getting you.

624
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Now going forward more, there's a battle going on and the companies out in the field.

625
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And they're not directly involved in the battle.

626
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
So they get told, okay, you want you to go set up where the VC is going to run to.

627
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Where we think they're going to run.

628
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You guys set up a blocking force so that way when the VC runs into you, you ambush them and take them out.

629
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
So they're kind of maneuvering to go set that up.

630
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
His普通 is maneuvering to set that up and we're going to book after 15 minutes or so.

631
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
We were approximately halfway down the ridge.

632
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
The captain gave me a call.

633
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Dragon six had decided it would be better if I have to my普通 marching the two elements in opposite directions in order to cover a larger area.

634
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I was dead set against this.

635
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:42.000
My普通 was below strength and dividing it would be asking two reinforced rifle squads to defend hundreds of acres of jungle against a foe of unknown size.

636
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
So dragon six is above the company commander.

637
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
This is now the battalion commander.

638
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And so now you're getting an order from the battalion commander.

639
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
So it's, you know, you're a young lieutenant,

640
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
a platoon commander and you're getting told to do this and he doesn't feel good about it.

641
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Back to the book.

642
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
But orders were orders, especially from dragon six.

643
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
I passed back the word for Shalden brand to come up.

644
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
I was pouring over my map and compass when Shalden brand reached me.

645
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
The battle was full, full blown.

646
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
It sound, it sound provided background noise.

647
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
It's a brief shelly on the situation and our orders.

648
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Shit, I don't like it sir.

649
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I know I don't either, but it's a lick.

650
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
You got your map and compass.

651
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Good.

652
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
So it's all kinds of reasons why they don't like this idea.

653
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Obviously one that he already stated was that, you know, you take your platoon and you cut him in half.

654
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
That's, that's just, you don't have the same fighting capability at all.

655
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
I think they had one one heavy machine gun in each squad.

656
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
So now you got basically their down to two squads because they were under strength.

657
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
So we're talking one heavy machine gun.

658
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
And by the way, if somebody gets wounded, you know, you got your wounded guy.

659
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And if you're going to carry that guy, it takes two or three guys to carry the guy.

660
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
So that's four guys gone.

661
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
So you could very easily be outnumbered outman and outgun by the enemy.

662
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000
So he doesn't like this idea on top of that.

663
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
I will tell you, he doesn't talk about it here.

664
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
When you split up in a situation like this, it becomes very difficult to do command and control.

665
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And now you got two elements that are weaker size and you're no longer able to support each other.

666
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
That's the premise of cover move.

667
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Cover move means you want to be close enough that you could support each other.

668
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
You don't want to split far apart where you can't help each other or something happens.

669
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Well, that's what they're getting told to do.

670
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
They don't like it.

671
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And, but they do it.

672
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
And maybe he should have protested more, but he's getting orders from the battalion commander.

673
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And he says, okay, let's do it.

674
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
And of course, within a couple minutes of doing it, they lose radio contact.

675
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
So now they can't, they can't hear each other and they're starting to march apart.

676
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Finally, they get radio, they get connected on the radio again.

677
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
They get comms again.

678
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
And it sounds like this.

679
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
One five.

680
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
This is one six.

681
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Have you figured out where you are yet?

682
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
This is one five.

683
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Negative.

684
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
So Shelley with his squad is lost.

685
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Doesn't know where he is.

686
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Okay.

687
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Now, the lieutenant's all set up, though.

688
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
They're in their position where they're thinking the enemy might come by.

689
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
They're set up to attack them.

690
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
And here we go back to the book.

691
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Lieutenant, Porter whispered as he reached my side.

692
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
We hear noises to our front.

693
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Commander moving across in front of us in the jungle, hold on a second, Porter.

694
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
One five.

695
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
This is one six.

696
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
The sound of the battle should be on your right.

697
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
If you're going in the right direction, where are the sounds over?

698
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
This is one five.

699
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Negative on the right.

700
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
The sounds are on the left over.

701
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
One five.

702
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Did you just say the sounds are on your left?

703
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I was squeezing the handsets so hard my knuckles were white.

704
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Affirmative.

705
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Jesus Christ.

706
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
One five.

707
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I hosted whispered intensely.

708
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Into the mouthpiece, you're heading in our direction.

709
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
I could hear the sounds of men moving through the jungle below us.

710
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I whispered the Porter.

711
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Get back down there and tell them to hold their fire.

712
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
That may not be thanks after all.

713
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Hurry.

714
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Porter had heard the conversation with Shelley and quickly turned to our to carry out at my order.

715
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
He couldn't yell because the sounds were coming from the dink soldiers.

716
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
His yell would put us in jeopardy.

717
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
As Porter started toward the crew, the machine gun crew opened fire.

718
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.000
The harshness of the guns multiple explosions ripped across my thoughts as it sound echoed through the handset I was holding next to my ear.

719
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
The sound of American swearing and screaming rebounded from the jungle below and from my handset.

720
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Sees fire.

721
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Sees fire.

722
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.000
I screamed.

723
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Sees fire.

724
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
So he can actually hear his guys getting shot by his own guys.

725
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
We have a blue one blue.

726
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Porter and I were running to the gun crew both of us yelling.

727
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Sees fire.

728
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Sees fire.

729
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
The sound of their gun blanketing the screams in front of them.

730
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
A abruptly the gun quit firing.

731
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I yelled into the jungle.

732
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Shelley, is that you?

733
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Yes, yes.

734
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Stop firing.

735
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Don't fire.

736
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
I was answered by many voices.

737
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
I stood there and instant.

738
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:16.000
The horrible realization that I had fired on my own men's swept over me like a wave from an ice cold hell.

739
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
The gun crew looked at me.

740
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Their faces filled with shock.

741
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I ran leaping and falling down to the brush line where my men were asking the question to anybody hit for Christ's sake.

742
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Gallagher yelled back as I burst into a small clearing.

743
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
One man, the point man.

744
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
So there you go.

745
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Blue on blue.

746
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Another reason why if you don't have to separate your forces you don't.

747
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
You don't separate your forces unless you have to.

748
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
And when you do it you do with extreme caution.

749
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.000
And when we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've talked about blue on blue it happens and always books it happens in my book and some of these descriptions right here.

750
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I recognize those 100% when he says the horrible realization that fired on my own men swept over me like a wave from an ice cold hell.

751
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Yeah, I totally recognize that and the fact that he says the gun crew looked at me their faces filled with shock when I when I explained to my guys in the field like that was a blue on blue their faces were just complete shock.

752
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:25.000
If you're in the military if you're in law enforcement be very careful when you split your forces.

753
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:33.000
It's if it just multiplies the challenges sometimes it is necessary but you got to keep control over it.

754
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000
And now we go to where he's calling for a met a back for his for his wounded guy.

755
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Delta six is one six over this is Delta six over this is one six.

756
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000
I need to dust off for a peanut we've run into a little action over this is Delta six what do you mean a little action what's going on what happened over.

757
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
My knees felt weak in my stomach with sour.

758
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
This is one six we had a little difficulty with with with the terrain and.

759
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I ambushed one five over what how the fuck did you do that one six you mean you ambushed your own men what kind of after you running up there.

760
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000
That's the most ass-night thing I've ever heard of you get your head out of your ass one six and get that between straightened up you got that over.

761
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
This is one six affirmative over.

762
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Ah one six give me your coordinates the dust off saw this way how bad is your peanuts over this is one six not too bad he'll lose a couple of toes but everybody else is okay over.

763
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
All right one six settled down out.

764
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:45.000
He was more gentle with the last transmission because I'm sure he heard my voice showed the strain I was feeling whatever the reason I welcome the sound of his voice.

765
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Perhaps he understood better than I thought what had happened.

766
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So he comes out and real hard.

767
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000
He realizes that the guy feels horrible and and and then he kind of backs off and says set along he also knows he's got to stay in the game.

768
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:11.000
And there's a nightmare of a video on YouTube of and there's actually it's from a documentary but there was a really bad blue on blue in the first Gulf War where a patchy gun ship let it lit up.

769
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:19.000
I think it was a Bradley some kind of APC it's a nightmare but you can hear the one guy that fired.

770
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.000
They're saying hey you got to get back in position you know hold the line basically and he's like I just killed my own guys I want to come back in there they're saying negative.

771
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000
And so that's basically what this what Captain Cells is doing here saying hey listen okay I'm pissed but guess what calm down.

772
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Settle down get you shit together and he says out and and by the way for those folks that aren't military.

773
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Over when you say over at the end of a transmission on the radio it means you expect a reply.

774
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000
When you say out there's no reply expected so like when we end this podcast I say out because it's over there do you don't don't don't.

775
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Don't don't don't say anything back to me it's over I don't say over and sometimes you'll hear people say over and out in the military that doesn't you don't say that it doesn't make any sense.

776
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
So when you hear that in a movie know that they know that they are cheesy.

777
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Is that kind of like when you when they hang up the phone on the movie you go to and hear the dialto.

778
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Yes that doesn't really happen either.

779
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:26.000
I trudged back back to the book I trudged back to my position one five in his men following man handed me a.

780
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000
A can of coffee I changed smoke my cigarettes and drank coffee while the patron expanded into a larger perimeter.

781
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.000
I stood facing the mountain the battle still raging on one five walked over to me still shaken from his experience.

782
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:47.000
He told me how he was sorry that he had gotten me in such a Dutch with a captain and we discussed the operation going over his mistake while he attempted to figure out ways.

783
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
To keep it from happening again if we were ever split up.

784
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Shelley and I had been through too much together for me to blame him for what had happened.

785
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
I told him so and we let it go at that we had been lucky.

786
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Besides I blamed myself for what had happened.

787
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
The responsibility for any unit actions ultimately rests with its commander.

788
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000
The leader got the glory when things worked out and he took the blame when they didn't.

789
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:25.000
That went with the job when it came right down to it the men were my responsibility and I had failed them today.

790
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
A little bit of extreme ownership if you read the book extreme ownership that lay for and I wrote the opening chapter that's what it's about.

791
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Blue on blue and doing exactly what what lieutenant down did right there taking ownership of what the mistakes were made in the battlefield.

792
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Back to the book there's a couple of got well actually not yet there they link up with another with another platoon and now there have an conversation.

793
00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Downs is having a conversation with another officer named Anderson a drink was lying next to us as we talked.

794
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
He had a black ace of spades stuck onto his fist.

795
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Anderson what's that all about that's so the dinks know what outfit fucked them up over here look around most of the dinks got those in their hands sure enough the dinks were all holding an ace of spades.

796
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000
That's a good idea but where did you get all the aces one of the guys moms works in a card store so he wrote home asking to send her a couple packs of nothing but aces spades.

797
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Why did we want to kill dinks.

798
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.000
After all we had mostly been law-biting citizens back in the world and we were taught that to take another man's life was wrong.

799
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Somehow the perspective got twisted in a war.

800
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000
The government told us it was all right and in fact a must to kill members of another government's per people.

801
00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Then we had the law on our side it turned out that most of us like to kill other men some of the guys which shoot it a dink as much as they would add a target.

802
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Some of the men didn't like to kill a dink up close the closer the killing the more personal it became.

803
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Others in the platoon like to kill in close a few even like to torture the dinks if they had a prisoner or cut the dead bodies with knives and a frenzy of aggression.

804
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000
A few didn't like to kill at all and wouldn't fire their weapons except to protect their buddies.

805
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Mostly we all saw it as a job and rationalized it in our own way.

806
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Over at all ran the streak of anger or fear that for brief moments ruled us all.

807
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:42.000
My job as platoon leader was to control the spectrum of emotions to guide the men towards survival.

808
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.000
I didn't believe in torturing or allowing a dink to die a lingering death in the jungle we never took prisoners if we could help it.

809
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Every day we spent the jungle he wrote into a little more of our humanity away.

810
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Prisoners could escape to become our enemy again hence no prisoners.

811
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:10.000
The philosophical arguments in favor of man's ability to resist the slide into barbarism sound noble and rational in a classroom or at a cocktail party.

812
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000
But when the enemy is bearing down on you bent on taking your life away from you it's not his country against your country.

813
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Not his army against your army, not his philosophy against your philosophy.

814
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000
It's the fact that that son of a bitch is trying to kill you and you better kill him first.

815
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
That's a reality right there.

816
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Now going back to tactics a little bit.

817
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Back to the book there was a spot about midway down the mountain marked in blue that meant something bigger than a stream.

818
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:56.000
If I were an enemy commander that would be a perfect spot for a camp high mountains on three sides a good water supply thick jungle growth and escape path in any directions.

819
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000
If he decided on that location the enemy commander would be counting on attack from the valley up towards his location.

820
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
He would have his back guarded but not very heavily or so I reasoned.

821
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I just liked that because you can see he's getting his mind in the mind of the enemy.

822
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000
He's thinking about what was he looking at the map. He sees stream. He sees valley. He sees good good covered positions from three sides.

823
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000
He's thinking okay this is what the enemy must be thinking right here.

824
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Now the fighting continues and as always you know I'm burning through book. I mean this is a this is a 250 page book and I'm reading you know what maybe 20 pages from it.

825
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000
So there's so much action going on and so many good lessons to learn.

826
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Obviously I can't cover them all that's why you can buy this book yourself as you should.

827
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:57.000
But here we go I'm going to a point here where they've been in a firefight. They got three wounded one of the guys lost an arm one of them's unconscious.

828
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:05.000
And they're getting they have a helicopter to come in and the helicopters lower down a cable and they're lifting the guys out to get them to a meta-vax situation.

829
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Back to the book the signal was given and the cable pulled him off the ground about halfway up he waved all of us grinning like a treasure cat blood dripped on us.

830
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Who's a picture I shall always hold in my mind a man dangling from a cable holding a stick fast into a turnic it on the stump of his leg waving at his comrades with the other hand a cigarette dangling from his lips.

831
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000
One six this is getting hairy up here we're starting to take fire the pilot reported hold on just one more.

832
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Spagon I lifted the unconscious man up while we slid the vest onto him someone had to be the cable which I hooked onto the ring.

833
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
The unconscious man was wimched upward dangling like a limp doll at the end of a cable.

834
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Spagon I stood underneath watching this final Exodus as the crew man reached out to grab the man something went wrong.

835
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
The man had become unhooked and somehow fell through 50 feet of sky towards us.

836
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
We jumped back as the man fell in a heap at our feet.

837
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
The medic and I pulled the man over.

838
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Fuck he stopped breathing.

839
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000
He goes on to say the nutrition rate on our side was terrible on our morale.

840
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Although we killed and wounded many of the NVA we never knew how much it hurt them.

841
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
It seemed there was an unlimited number to take their places.

842
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:38.000
But on our side when we lost a man we all knew and it wore heavily on our minds.

843
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:48.000
The constant marching and fighting demanded two things of us strength and absolute reliability.

844
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Now they're moving out on another operation and there's one of the soldiers named Yoder.

845
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Yoder was the point man. He was experienced and full of good humor due to his promotion to door gunner.

846
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000
A good man to have on point any day he was aggressive and unaffraid.

847
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Even though he was going in soon there was no question of putting someone else in his place on point.

848
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
It was his turn and he would not have it in any other way.

849
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
So he's getting promoted to door gunner so he's going to pull out the field.

850
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
He's going to fly around and helicopter.

851
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000
You know, relatively safe compared to being in the field.

852
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000
He reminded me of a hillbilly with this course language, man, rhythms and humor.

853
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000
I was always asking him who he was going to get that front tooth replaced.

854
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000
That missing tooth made him look more like a hillbilly than anything else.

855
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000
He always laughed and said, fuck sir, I ain't about to let them fucking army dentist work on me.

856
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
She had no that would be a lick on me.

857
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000
So they continue their patrol and they're coming up on this kind of flat area and Yoder,

858
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Crap forward and a crouch looked back at me and grinned.

859
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I grinned back and nodded my head.

860
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Yoder stepped over a tree route holding up part of the small gully bank.

861
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
At that moment all hell broke loose as a chai-com machine gun strafed the point element.

862
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Yoder was hitting the body and fell forward into the gully.

863
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
The machine gun acted as a key which triggered a complete ambush.

864
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
We walked into a classical U-shaped ambush with the machine gun being at the base of the U.

865
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So we used to call this a fire sack when you get ambushed and you're completely surrounded by the enemy.

866
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's where they are.

867
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Starts with this machine gun, hit Noder and then just breaks out.

868
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Explosions, machine guns and rifle bullets rip through the air and ricochet off the ground and trees around us.

869
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
The noise was overwhelming men were screaming and yelling trying desperately to get cover or screaming when they were hit or thought they were hit,

870
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
which was almost as terrifying.

871
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
We still not seen any of the enemy in the thick growth around us.

872
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Most of us in the point played dead.

873
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I lay trying to get my thinking organized as to what to do so you're just taking massive ambush and you're laying there thinking,

874
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
what am I going to do?

875
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I could hear Yoder crying on the other side of the route where you'd fallen.

876
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
He cried out for me to come and get him.

877
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Lieutenant, I've been hit, I've been hit bad, I'm dying, please come and get me, please come and get me.

878
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I turned my head in his direction.

879
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Twigs and bark from trees were falling like snow all around us as the terrible shrapnel and firepower rip through the jungle around us.

880
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I was terrified.

881
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So they're pinned down and he's actually ends up going to try and help one of the other guys first, a guy named Bell.

882
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Then he gets to Bell under covering fire.

883
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
And he says Bell was able to help me but couldn't see anything.

884
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
He limped and crawled, I pushed and swore as we continuously fell in our flight back up the hill.

885
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
As I pulled him up the hill, one of my feet was shot up from underneath me.

886
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I'd been shot in the hill, one of the bullets knocking off a piece of my boot heel.

887
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And then the force had knocked me down.

888
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I got to begin and felt a tremendous blow to my hip, knocking me down.

889
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
He'd again, I thought, finally I got Bell behind a rock.

890
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Doc was there and started working on him.

891
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I lay on my back looking up at the sky through the jungle canopy, not believing I'd actually made it down there and back.

892
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Yoder was still down there and although I had witnessed the bullets hitting him, I didn't want to leave.

893
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I had to be absolutely sure he was dead.

894
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I would never forgive myself if I pulled back and he was still alive.

895
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I was ready to call artillery in on our position if we were overrun.

896
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
That's like the ultimate.

897
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
The ultimate game over move.

898
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
We're going to be overrun by the enemy.

899
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Here we go.

900
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I'm going to call all the ordinance on my position.

901
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Drop.

902
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Luckily, the fire subsides, one of the other pertains had come to their help.

903
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And now that other pertune shows up and the enemy's pretty much gone and it stops shooting.

904
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
We all stood up.

905
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
A couple of my men and I ran down to where three sixes point was standing over Yoder.

906
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I leaped over the edge of the gully and stopped at Yoder's body.

907
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Neeling down, I turned his body over.

908
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
He had died with his head lying downhill.

909
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
His face was a dark blue from the blood which gravity had pulled into the downhill portion of his body.

910
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There wasn't much blood on his body but numerous bullet holes were cut into his fatigues covering his stomach and chest.

911
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
His eyes were closed.

912
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
I looked at him for a moment.

913
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
My thoughts running back to our many conversations in the past.

914
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Once we had discussed whether we would go to the aid of one of our fellow soldiers if he was in trouble.

915
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I had told him I would always respond to one of my men if they needed help.

916
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
He had replied it would be a lick on me.

917
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I wondered if he had known that I tried to get to him.

918
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
He was the first man under my command to die.

919
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I looked up to see some of my platoon and three-sixes platoon standing over a dink body in the gully.

920
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Three-sixes had an Indian hiss platoon and I had an Indian in my platoon.

921
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
They drew their knives and slashed the enemy's body in frustration.

922
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
This was the only dead dink the men could find.

923
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
One lousy dink for all that pain and suffering.

924
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
At least we could take our head out on that son of a bitch.

925
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000
They had also taken one prisoner as well the other platoon head.

926
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And so now he starts thinking back to the book.

927
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
This is it I thought.

928
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'd been wounded four times in battle.

929
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I had done my job.

930
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Captain Cells had asked after my third wound if I wanted to be sent back.

931
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Anyone with three wounds was due that.

932
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
All it took was two wounds to get you out of the field.

933
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Surely forward let me live with myself.

934
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
What was I trying to prove?

935
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But I answered my own question.

936
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
The men depend on me.

937
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It's my job to keep them alive by giving them good leadership and looking after them.

938
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
They need me.

939
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah, but shit.

940
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
What did I owe myself?

941
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I had a wife and two little girls who needed me.

942
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
The $10,000 in insurance money wouldn't do them much good.

943
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Where did my duty lie?

944
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I was still shaking.

945
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I couldn't go through this again.

946
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Reluctantly almost against my wheel.

947
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I started walking toward the captain.

948
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Captain?

949
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Yes, Fred.

950
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You asked once if I wanted to go out of the field.

951
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
If I'd been wounded a third time, he turned and looked into my face.

952
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yes.

953
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Well, I think I mean, would you think I was letting you and my men down if I did?

954
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
I stammered?

955
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
No, I wouldn't.

956
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
You've done your job.

957
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I could get you a job.

958
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Get you a good job with S2.

959
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
That's the intelligence back in the rear.

960
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I think I want out.

961
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I don't know if I can do this again.

962
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Maybe I can't cut it.

963
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That's nonsense.

964
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
You're a hell of a fine officer and the men will understand, but you think about it.

965
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Okay, I will.

966
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Let me think.

967
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
A little bit of confidence returned to his words.

968
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
I handed you orders, things to him.

969
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I wandered back to the packs thinking.

970
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I should find you orders pack.

971
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Bell had stood up and was coming toward me when he saw that blindfolded Dink.

972
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
In one motion, he swung his fist into the Dink's face.

973
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
He hit him again and again knocking the surprise Dink down in a burst of fury.

974
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Bell started kicking him.

975
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
It was obvious Bell was going to kill him.

976
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
The other men and I stood smoking and watching.

977
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
We were going to let Bell kill the Dink.

978
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Bell had the right.

979
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Captain Cells yelled and ran over to us, pushing me out of the way.

980
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
And pulling Bell off the Dink.

981
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Here, what's this?

982
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
What's going on?

983
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
We are not going to have this in my company.

984
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
This man's a prisoner.

985
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Lieutenant Downs, what are you doing just standing there?

986
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
I looked at him in surprise.

987
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Bell was killing this motherfucker.

988
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
What's wrong with that?

989
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I retorted.

990
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
You know God damn well.

991
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
What's a matter with that lieutenant?

992
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
This man is defenseless and our prisoner.

993
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Now let's get this prisoner back to the L.D.

994
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
L.Z.

995
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I wanted the Dink dead.

996
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But the captain was right.

997
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
So you can see there.

998
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Obviously, Captain Cells has a great head on his shoulders.

999
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000
And there's something else that play.

1000
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The other thing that's at play is that by function of the way the battle went down.

1001
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And by function of being one rank above the Ptum commanders that are in the firefights,

1002
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
guess what he is defecto.

1003
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
He's detached.

1004
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
He's detached.

1005
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
He didn't.

1006
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I mean, Bell as the guy was pinned down almost got killed, right?

1007
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
He's the guy that's emotional.

1008
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And guess who pulled him out, wrist his life lost,

1009
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Yoda, that was down.

1010
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So these guys are emotional.

1011
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
They're, they're, they want to kill this guy.

1012
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
They captured him.

1013
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
He's VC.

1014
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Let's kill him.

1015
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And Captain Cells is detached because he wasn't in that firefight.

1016
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
He wasn't directly there.

1017
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000
So he's able to maintain enough mental detachment to, to make a hard decision.

1018
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
But also hold the line.

1019
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And this is something that, you know, when we go through the me lime ascertain,

1020
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
this could have happened over and over again.

1021
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
This could have happened to any, anywhere along the way.

1022
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Someone could have said, hey, what are you doing right there?

1023
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Stop.

1024
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
We don't do that.

1025
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
And that's exactly what Cells does.

1026
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And I think another thing that's important from a leadership perspective.

1027
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Also, well, before I go to that point, you notice that when he's having the personal conversation

1028
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000
with Lieutenant Downey calls him Fred, but when he's screwing up and he needs to kind of put him in his place,

1029
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
he's Lieutenant Downey's.

1030
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
On top of that, from the leadership perspective, from Captain Cells perspective,

1031
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
he's got to always remember that what is happening,

1032
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
that they are emotional, that they did just lose their body.

1033
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
He's got, he can't just, you know, be so on the straight narrow that goes, oh, I'm going to court Marshal you.

1034
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
He could court Marshal, right?

1035
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Hey, you abused a prisoner.

1036
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You're, you know, I'm going to court Marshal you.

1037
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And he doesn't do that because he understands their perspective.

1038
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
And that's why, you know, again, throughout this book, Cells really impresses me as a,

1039
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
as a very square way good solid leader.

1040
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
As does Downs.

1041
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I mean, Downs, obviously right here, he's emotional.

1042
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And he's lost it.

1043
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
He's, he's, he's cross the line, right?

1044
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
But all it takes is Cells just to get back over here, buddy.

1045
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
You cross the line, come back and he says the captain was right.

1046
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
So that's all it took, just a little snap, just to get him to attach a little bit for the emotions

1047
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000
and, and move move away from the darkness.

1048
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Back to the book, I walked over to the bodies.

1049
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
The odors eyes were partially shut and I leaned down to push them close, not that it didn't

1050
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
be good, but for some reason, I thought it was better that way.

1051
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I stood there with one hand on my aching hip, smoking and thinking.

1052
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000
The odors face was all muddy from the numerous times he'd been dropped in the mud, and it was a trickle of blood at the base of his throat.

1053
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
This is the way it will always end, I thought.

1054
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Men being killed in the jungle, other men dragging their bodies out, putting them on choppers,

1055
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
and the rest of us going back to the fighting.

1056
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
When they left on the chopper, it was as if they had never been.

1057
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Men's beginning and men's end would always be attended by only a few.

1058
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Those that bore them at birth and those that bore them at death.

1059
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
The only important thing was what he did in between.

1060
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Good or bad or indifferent.

1061
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Touch those around him in some way and then be gone.

1062
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000
I wondered if a salute would be in order, not necessarily in the military sense, but a salute from one who had known him and who had never forget him.

1063
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I decided it was and I raised my hand to my forehead in a farewell.

1064
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Now the birds come in and pick them up as after he gives that final salute to Yoder.

1065
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Smoke was popped and the large choppers swung in towards us for his landing.

1066
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
The doors were pushed back and I saw the door gunner on the side facing me looking around, angiously searching for the ominous,

1067
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
for the omnipresent enemy.

1068
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Good man, I thought, not trusting a goddamn thing even with an American infantry company surrounding the LZ.

1069
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I love that. He's noticing that this door gunner is coming in and he's coming in and picking up and instead of this guy cut in corners.

1070
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I mean, I got this thing in front of me and there's no rounds being fired.

1071
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I'm just going to relax and know this guy's in the game opens the door.

1072
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Doesn't want to say he says not trusting a goddamn thing even with an American infantry company on the LZ.

1073
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Many thoughts were criss-crossing my mind above everything else ran the thought that I could not abandon my men.

1074
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I felt that shame that I had asked Captain Cells to pull me out of the field earlier when I was still shaken.

1075
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
What would the men think if they found out I was doing such a thing?

1076
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Worse, what would I think of myself?

1077
01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Now they continue to do operations and eventually they get pulled out of the field on this for the final time on a helicopter back to the book.

1078
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
The machine carried us away.

1079
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
I looked over my men sprawled along the sides of the chopper.

1080
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
They didn't remove the magazines from their weapons before boarding and now we're holding them close to their bodies.

1081
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000
The men were dirty and unshaven, their clothes and various stages of disrepair, jungle boots worn and torn with claws and mud between the cleats.

1082
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
There were dark rings under their eyes and their faces were drawn and tired.

1083
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Some of those faces were new men, sent out to a place that started the operation in where they were erased.

1084
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
We had experienced the worst of life and the most challenging.

1085
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
We had survived.

1086
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
The platoon I took back was not the platoon I had brought out.

1087
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Now they're on yet another operation.

1088
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
If they go back they get reset and they're out on another operation.

1089
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Doing a patrol and I'm going back to the book about five meters past the gate.

1090
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
The two men turned to me and waved me forward. All clear, sir. Let's go, Rudo.

1091
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I passed through the gate. My right hand grasped my M16, my left held my cigarette.

1092
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I was humming the blue tail fly as I mentally ticked off the positions around the saddle where I would set my men.

1093
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I noticed the time.

1094
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
07.45 hours.

1095
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000
My foot slipped backwards a fraction of an inch hitting the trigger mechanism of a mine.

1096
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I never heard the explosion.

1097
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Black powder and dirt flew by me. My ear drums ripped.

1098
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
My body was flying through the air. I threw my arms in front of me and a reflex motion to balance myself.

1099
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.000
My eyes registered the horror of a brilliantly white jagged bone sticking out of the stump of arm above where my left elbow had been.

1100
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Ragged bloody flesh around at the splintered bone.

1101
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
My mind cursed as utter helplessness and disrepair and despair overwhelmed me.

1102
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Another part of my body coolly calculated what it caused the explosion.

1103
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000
It had been a landmine. But what kind would blow off my arm instead of my legs?

1104
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Of course, it had to be a bouncing beddy. A mine that flies up to out of the ground after being tripped and explodes waste high.

1105
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
That would do it.

1106
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000
My I'm 16 had been in my right hand. The rifle was shattered. My hand was mangled.

1107
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I stared in horror at what remained of my right arm. The flesh had been ripped away exposing two bones in my white forearm from wrist to the elbow.

1108
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000
The bones look like two white glistening, narrow rods buried in raw bloody meat.

1109
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Thinking my god, my god, my god, I felt told defeat of my life as I landed on my feet five yards from where the mine exploded.

1110
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000
After landing, I staggered forward two or three steps and then collapsed. My legs wouldn't work.

1111
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000
The mine had gone off about six inches from my left hip.

1112
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:17.000
From the waist down my body was mutilated and torn where large chunks of flesh, muscles, blood vessels and nerves had been ripped away by the hot exploding shrapnel.

1113
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000
My buttocks were blown away. The back of my legs were ripped to the bone down to my heels.

1114
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
I rolled over on my back being careful to keep my stump and right arm out of the dirt and sand.

1115
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000
My body was sending so many pain signals to my brain that it overloaded like an electrical circuit.

1116
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000
It caused me to feel a racing, humming, numbness.

1117
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I lifted my head to view a scene from hell.

1118
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I watched a couple of men run by me to the wounded point man. They would only glance at my, at me sideways as I lay there holding my bloody stump in the air.

1119
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
They seem nervous.

1120
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Some of my men ran toward me, then turned suddenly away at the sight of my torn body.

1121
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000
They stood near me but hesitated to come too close as if their movement through the air would make it worse.

1122
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Spag asked me to turn sideways a little bit so he could pull my gear off. There were tears as eyes as he worked over me.

1123
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
With a grunt he pulled the belt out from under me.

1124
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Is there anything I can do for you? Spag asked, yes run over there and pick up my arm and bring it back to me. I don't want to leave it in this stinking village.

1125
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000
I told Marley to get my squad leaders. Go take care of the other men dock. They need you.

1126
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I looked up. Marley and my squad leaders were standing in a rough line along my right side. I asked who was hurt. I was feeling weaker and weaker. It was so goddamn cold.

1127
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000
As my body fought for life, my thoughts ran to my man and my platoon. I felt I was cheating them by leaving them when they needed me most.

1128
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
When I joined the platoon as their leader, they had taught me the ways to survive in combat.

1129
01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:01.000
A second lieutenant who was new in country and they were old timers, 18, 19, 20, but old to the ways of combat and death.

1130
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:12.000
As I gained experience and confidence as a leader, I became an old timer. Having to make decisions that put me in the position I was in now wounded and maimed facing death.

1131
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000
My men were still up there looking at me, despair on their faces. Their invulnerable leader had been brought down.

1132
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Marley, yes sir, I want you to your men to get the dink who planted that mine. I want them dead. Get them. We will once six. Don't you worry about that. They looked at each other. Then back at me.

1133
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:43.000
The gray haze of the day was strong. I pushed it back to look beyond my men. It was colder now and harder to see.

1134
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:53.000
I was thinking of my grandma down and her farm of the woods and fields of Indiana. I loved so much. If only I could walk them one more time.

1135
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I'm only 23 years old and I'm dying. What a waste. There are so many things I had meant to do and say, but I hadn't. Now I will never get the chance.

1136
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:25.000
So, obviously, although he thought he was going to die, he lived. He lost his arm. He ended up with severe wounds.

1137
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:38.000
He got discharged from the army. That's one of the things in the story. He had actually got picked up for pilot program. He's going to be a pilot. He's going to stay in the army. He's going to be a pilot.

1138
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Obviously, that was gone because he didn't have an arm anymore. Luckily, he was able to save his other arm. But severe wounds were long rehab. Eventually, he ends up going back to college.

1139
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And here we go back to the book. In the fall of 1968, as I stopped at a traffic light on my walk to class across the campus of the University of Denver, a man stepped up to me and said, hi.

1140
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Without waiting for my reply to his greeting, he pointed to the hooks taking out of my left sleeve. Get that in Vietnam. I said, yeah, up near Tam Kay and one corps serves you right.

1141
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:45.000
As the man walked away, I still rooted, too confused with hurt, shame and anger to react. Ten years have passed. The hurt, shame and anger still flood over me with the memory. But one thing I am certain.

1142
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:57.000
None of the men I knew who served in Vietnam deserved a dire to be maimed either physically or mentally. I think it is necessary now to give Vietnam to give another view of Vietnam.

1143
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:09.000
That of the day-to-day life of an infantry man on the ground. I have always been asked what I thought about Vietnam, but never when it was like to fight in Vietnam.

1144
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:24.000
This is the way it was for us, the platoon of Delta 16.

1145
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And in the afterward, he talks about why he wrote this book. In writing the killing zone, I had two goals.

1146
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I wanted future young infantry lieutenant and non-commissioned officers to learn from my experiences, both good and bad.

1147
01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Some actions I took as a combat officer had worked out well and some had not. The time had come to deal with both. Perhaps some would learn from my mistakes, especially the lessons that combat, especially the lesson that combat does not go by the book.

1148
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I also wanted to show future generations that the American soldier in Vietnam was a good soldier. In 1978, the anti-war anti-military feeling in the United States was pervasive in the newspapers on television, among writers and movies and colleges.

1149
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I had started college at the University of Denver in the fall of 1968 while I was still on active duty in the military. The students for a democratic society, the weathermen and other anti-war groups on campus targeted anyone in the military as fair game for their anti-war stance.

1150
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Such hostility was not pleasant for me or other Vietnam veterans. It was hard to be denigrated for serving your country. Many veterans have never had never had never had been in the service for many years after Vietnam.

1151
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Angry at the anti-war faction, I wanted to set the record straight by proving that the men I served with had fought and died with honor.

1152
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And here are the men that died and made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and for their brothers in arms from Delta Company, first battalion of the 14th Infantry, third brigade, fourth infantry division.

1153
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:46.000
PFC Donald Lawrence Glover, PFC Norman Charles Kissinger, PFC Robert Wayne Seaton,

1154
01:23:46.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Speck 4 Gregory Thomas Eiding, Speck 4 Charles Irwin Edwin Doc Hoffman, PFC James Garrett Miller,

1155
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Speck 4 James Strong Yoder, PFC William Henry Hark, Speck 4 Stephen Richard Anderson, Speck 4 Lewis Charles Nelson,

1156
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Second Lieutenant William Dwight Ordway, PFC Paul James Miller, Speck 4 Jose Cortez,

1157
01:24:41.000 --> 01:25:10.000
PFC Charles Peter Torleyett, and Second Lieutenant John C. Martin. So Fred Downs, Second Lieutenant asked us to do two things in this book, first learned from his experiences.

1158
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:23.000
The mistakes, the lessons, and that is what we do here. We read and we study and we think and we learn.

1159
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And the second thing he asks is that we remember the man who fought and died with honor.

1160
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:48.000
And that's something that we need to do and we should continue to do each and every day. Remember.

1161
01:25:48.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And that is one thing about this podcast that has a lot of meaning to me.

1162
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's the fact that people are listening to it and the memory of these types of men and the challenges that they face, it will be remembered.

1163
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:30.000
They will be remembered. Always.

1164
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So once again, the book is called the killing zone, my life in the Vietnam War by Frederick Downs.

1165
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:59.000
It's a fantastic read, it's a fantastic book, it's a fantastic dedication and it doesn't incredible job of honoring these men that fought so hard in a very unpopular war.

1166
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000
And by the book and read it, you will absolutely get a lot out of it.

1167
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Echo Charles.

1168
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000
I believe we can move on to the next sector of this podcast.

1169
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And again, if nothing else is delivered through this podcast, you know, let's let it be these couple things, these couple ideas of learning lessons from other people's experiences and remembering other people sacrifices.

1170
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:53.000
That's definitely one of the driving forces behind my will to do this podcast.

1171
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
And we're going to keep doing the podcast. Echo, get me out of here, please.

1172
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000
I'm in that zone right now.

1173
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I need to send up a red star cluster. You know what that is?

1174
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:12.000
So in the military, when you need help, it's a red star cluster. It's a flare. You pop up and it means you couldn't communicate with anybody and you need some help.

1175
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000
So there's my red star cluster. You need to jump in and say, hey, jockel speaking to the podcast.

1176
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Here's how we can support it. So talk about that while I get over here and get myself under control before I start smashing things.

1177
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
All right. Yeah. If you want to send any reinforcements to support jockel in our podcast here.

1178
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000
While supporting yourself with supplementation, by the way, good idea. Go to on it.com slash jockel.

1179
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
So on it has like these supplements that we take supplements.

1180
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
You're joined, krill oil boom,

1181
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:04.000
shrimp tech for performance, hard stuff, you know, crossfit to jitsu. If you're trying to go hard, you know hardcore in the paint. Yeah, shrimp tech boom.

1182
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Also, if you do your shopping at Amazon, which I think we all do.

1183
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Go ahead and click through our website. We have a little link there. You know, you can support it that way.

1184
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:26.000
That's a super easy way. I only got to do this. Remember to do it before you shop. That is helpful. Yeah. Very much so we also have a new tool.

1185
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Because can you can you make them remembering part of a little bit easier? Yes. So when, you know, you figure hey.

1186
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I got to remember to go to the website before I shop on Amazon.

1187
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Sometimes I'm in a hurry, whatever. Maybe I'm thinking about other stuff. I'm not thinking about jocgos podcast every single day all day.

1188
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I got to buy some, you know, some cleaner or some duct tape, whatever.

1189
01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Here's a way. So it helps you remember and or makes you not have to remember. You know, it's this little tool called the trooper tool.

1190
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Jocopotcaster. Pretty cool. Thanks to Brady for that one. Brady. Proxy. It's a cool little thing. It's like this small little thing is pretty cool. You click on there's a little link on both websites. So you click on the thing.

1191
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It asks you if you want it. You click yes. Put the little icon there on your browser and it basically directs you to the affiliate Amazon link automatically.

1192
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
You've got to think yeah, it's dope. And that's that's a really easy way to support the podcast.

1193
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yeah. And the, the, it doesn't cost you anything. It costs Amazon. And it seems to me like Amazon can afford to kick a little bit to the podcast over here.

1194
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Right. Yeah. And it's really, it does serve its purpose because you know, Amazon, you know, like Amazon there, you know, they're a good company provides good stuff, good service and all that.

1195
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And they're trying to get the word up. And you know, they, they partner with people who can get the word out.

1196
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah. And there's people that are going to go, you know what, I want to support the podcast. So I will buy this and set a buying it through some other website.

1197
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:14.000
They're going to go to the, the store that's going to support something that they enjoy or something that they get value out of hopefully from this podcast. So yeah, that's an awesome way to support. We appreciate it.

1198
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:28.000
And it makes it like, it's kind of, this little tool is kind of cool because it kind of makes it official, you know, like if you're, I mean, if you're one of the people that that listen to this and really talk with us and stuff, it's a cool way to kind of be more part of the group I guess.

1199
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It seems like it when I put my in up there, I'm like, hey, you know, I'm like fish. I don't know, I felt like I gave it.

1200
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
Yeah.

1201
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Echo Charles is in the game.

1202
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000
No, we dig that. So yeah, it's a, it's a really cool tool. You don't have to, it's safe. It's not like this. You just put it on. If you don't want it on there anymore, whatever reason.

1203
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Right click it right click. And it could you made a little video that shows you go to the Jockel podcast YouTube channel and echo Charles made a video of very high speed instructional video on how to do this.

1204
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Oh, I didn't turn away.

1205
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:13.000
But it's really easy. You are not playing around with the instructional video. I think that was very impressive. And by the way, subscribe to me a favor, to subscribe to the YouTube channel, the the Jockel podcast YouTube channel.

1206
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:25.000
That way, when echo because I'm been, I've been hacking on echo to make little outtakes and other little conversations and videos and he's like, well, you know, we got some subscribers, but maybe, you know, if we had some more, maybe I'd be more.

1207
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:51.000
So we need to motivate echo Charles just a little bit because so we could get some outtake videos, some other other interesting videos. I wanted to do a little preview today of what it was like when we're getting set up because we have a little ritual that we go through when we're making some some beverages, you know, some alpha brainy and we have, you know, so I was like, I'd be pretty cool if you shot a little video and he's like, well, you know, maybe one day.

1208
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I mean, right now. No, I actually am am a teenager. So subscribe to the, I don't think it doesn't, I mean, just just go to go to the Jockel podcast channel on YouTube. Subscribe.

1209
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Yeah, I think it's YouTube.com slash Jockel podcast. And also, what's cool about that is when you do that, then you get little emails that say, not like you just get an email, it says, hey, Jockel podcast just uploaded a new video. I get those and I'm always like, oh, yeah, cool. Now I can watch the video.

1210
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Even that's optional. Okay. If you want to opt out, but yeah, that's a good and I have a member that that one child children's book idea. I had yeah, you probably forget because no, you need to remind me I got a lot of ideas. I have that. I had that on video when we're talking anyway.

1211
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Oh, yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah. So yeah, some of some things you got to understand. So I have a certain stand. This is not talking to you. I'm talking to people that are listening right now.

1212
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I mean, you're here too. So I guess I'm talking to you too, but people got to understand that there's a certain expectation in my mind of what the podcast is and what it's supposed to be. So when something happens, that's not quite there.

1213
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I'm like, you know what, I don't really, hey, you know, I don't want to talk about that on the podcast, but this, like, for instance, before we hit record, we're recording, but before we go before I open the show, we're talking about something.

1214
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:25.000
We're always talking about something. And sometimes those conversations are 20 minutes, half an hour. We're talking about real stuff. We're talking about legit things, but we haven't even introduced the podcast yet. So that goes in the scrap pile.

1215
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Right. Now some of the scrap mile material while it might not be in March, Marching step with what the podcast is. It does perhaps have a, have a life that it could live and it could guide people in a certain way.

1216
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And it's stuff that people might be interested in. So that could be the YouTube download, you know, YouTube just post on there. So that way people get a little taste of other things around the podcast, which I think people would.

1217
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah, that makes sense. So like, you know, if you free your mind, you know, Charles, free your mind.

1218
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Yeah, you're totally right.

1219
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Well, thank you. Thank you.

1220
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
What's for once?

1221
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Yeah.

1222
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Yeah, because you know, if you listen to it on iTunes, you're like, why am I going to sit and watch Echo and John's with talk to each other? You know, I listened to one and I got to look at them to you know, a lot of people might not be interested in that.

1223
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000
There's some really, there's some moments. You know what I do is I, well, I watch certain moments of the podcast on YouTube.

1224
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Yeah.

1225
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Like when I know I was feeling intense about something, I go and see what it, see what that looks like. See, like, okay, what does that look like when I'm feeling that?

1226
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Does it look like, does it look like from the outside? What it feels like from the inside?

1227
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Because even today, I was getting pretty fired up. Like, I mean, you're talking about heroes and young man, man, 18, 19, 20 years old that said, okay, this unpopular war, I'll go fight it.

1228
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Yeah, I'll go fight it. You know, I'll go risk my life. I'll go out there in the jungle and live in, you know, I was, I was out this week in the field.

1229
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Right, camping. I kept putting in quotes on Twitter. I was putting in quotes because I was like, I can't call this the field.

1230
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:22.000
But you know, it wasn't the comfort of a house, right? It was in it was in it was, you know, bugs and ants and I'm like thinking myself, you know, this is nothing.

1231
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000
And I was thinking back to, to the forgotten highlander.

1232
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And remember the bugs were just eating those guys alive. And you know, you just, you just can't, you can't compare. So these guys that, that just stepped up fought, just want to, I just want to always, you know, that kind of thing will get me fired up. So when I go back to the videos, sometimes I go, man, what was I looking like right?

1233
01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:02.000
You know, little self assessment. And I wonder if, you know, because when I'm feeling that way, I'm like, okay, you got to attach a little bit because you're starting to get a little bit fired up.

1234
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And let's start breaking and start getting like really emotional about something. So I got to, I got a red flag goes up. I go to you get a back off a little bit here.

1235
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000
We don't have to edit the video if I break down.

1236
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So I got to just back off and sometimes I got to see what does that look like. Does it look, can you tell?

1237
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Am I looking, you know, so that's the kind of thing that I like to go back and look at the YouTube videos and say, you know, what does this look like?

1238
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this rebellion. There's a lot of value on YouTube that I'm, we're probably not, you know, capitalizing.

1239
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I don't know, but I prefer it for you.

1240
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Yeah, who care?

1241
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
And it's weird too because the interesting thing about this is you use the word capitalized, right?

1242
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000
In the fact of the matter is, we don't really capitalizing on this at all.

1243
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000
And I keep getting told by a variety of different people what to do to you to do what that right there, to capitalize.

1244
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I meant it to just capitalize not for us to come up with.

1245
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Yeah, I know for everybody, you know, people know what we, what we want to do is we want to maximize the effort that we put in here.

1246
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Want to maximize some of the people get the most out of it.

1247
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah, that's what I know that's what you meant.

1248
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000
I know you didn't mean like let's run the cash machine because we're doing it for the passion of doing it.

1249
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000
That's what I'm sitting here for sitting here so I can tell so I can tell this story right here about these guys.

1250
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah.

1251
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And I know, you know, I know I get, I hear from all kinds of cops.

1252
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I hear from my, my seal buddies that are still in that are listening to it that are,

1253
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000
ask me, text me questions going, hey man, what's going on with us?

1254
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Hey, what would you do differently here?

1255
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Hey, those are my buddies that are in that are getting ready to deploy overseas right now.

1256
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And I get texts and emails and Twitter things from guys that were guys that are act duty and the Marine Corps and the army.

1257
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000
So I know that we're getting the word out there and that's what that's what I'm sitting here for.

1258
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Yeah.

1259
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Yeah. And you make a good point with, you know, there's a lot of people who don't watch the video.

1260
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Of course.

1261
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
That's what they said.

1262
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I mean, I don't watch podcasts videos.

1263
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Right.

1264
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
I mean, why, why, why, why, you know, the reason podcasts are so convenient is that you can be doing something else.

1265
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Yes.

1266
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
You don't have to dedicate, you have to dedicate your all your senses to it.

1267
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You only have to dedicate two of them, your ears and your brain.

1268
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yeah.

1269
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
But you don't have to dedicate your eyes.

1270
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
You don't have to dedicate your ass to sit down and chair and watch something.

1271
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000
You can walk around.

1272
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000
You can do yard work.

1273
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
You can drive.

1274
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
You can do what you got to do.

1275
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Yeah.

1276
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
But I think the shorter little YouTube clips where you go, hey, check this out.

1277
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.000
This is when Jocquan, I were discussing a kids book that Echo was talking about or

1278
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
Good idea, I know it.

1279
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Yeah.

1280
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I don't know.

1281
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Yeah.

1282
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Post that thing up.

1283
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Yeah.

1284
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000
And it's interesting because a lot of people apparently don't, I mean, don't our surprise that I look different than I sound.

1285
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Yeah.

1286
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I guess.

1287
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
They think you're a skinny white hipster.

1289
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Or yeah.

1290
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000
That's what they think you are.

1291
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Maybe I have that heart.

1292
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Maybe you are at heart.

1293
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You're just trapped.

1294
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Maybe you identify as a skinny white hipster.

1295
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Maybe you know you're a, a 220.

1296
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
I don't know.

1297
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I don't, I don't identify myself by my physical characterist.

1298
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
I like that.

1299
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
It's what's in my heart in my mind.

1300
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
The content of your character is new.

1301
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Yeah.

1302
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000
I'm telling them I'm like, you're saying.

1303
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Yeah.

1304
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I think the YouTube I just get idea.

1305
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Yeah.

1306
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Yeah.

1307
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Yeah.

1308
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Yeah.

1309
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Yeah.

1310
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Yeah.

1311
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
From when we were filming commercials and stuff.

1312
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Oh, right.

1313
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Yeah.

1314
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
Yeah.

1315
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Those were good.

1316
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000
All right.

1317
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Anything else?

1318
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Jocka you in.

1319
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Jocka store.

1320
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Did you talk about that?

1321
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah.

1322
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Go to the store.

1323
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Buy some, buy some merch.

1324
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Somebody hit me up on Twitter the other day.

1325
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And they're like, hey, you should set up, we got to ask this bunch of times.

1326
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Set up a Patreon.

1327
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Patry on.

1328
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Is that what it's called?

1329
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Patreon.

1330
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Patreon.

1331
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Where you can donate to the podcast, certain amount.

1332
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And I just said, hey, man, go buy a t-shirt.

1333
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
You know, that supports us just as well.

1334
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And you get a t-shirt.

1335
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
And that's a good way to support the podcast.

1336
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000
You buy some merchandise.

1337
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Buy some deer.

1338
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Right.

1339
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Yeah.

1340
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000
The Jocka store.

1341
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000
That's a good one.

1342
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000
T-shirts.

1343
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Coffee mugs.

1344
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Stickers.

1345
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Those are kind of cool.

1346
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
One of my friends saw two Jocka stickers in the wild.

1347
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
In the wild.

1348
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Yeah.

1349
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Or maybe there's a little one on the other.

1350
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Yeah.

1351
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000
And then you go, everyone in San Diego, we know where everyone in San Diego doesn't count.

1352
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I don't know.

1353
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Yeah.

1354
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I don't see it.

1355
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I don't believe that.

1356
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
It counts.

1357
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Oh, but yeah.

1358
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Awesome.

1359
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
It's good.

1360
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000
So now we get to those questions from the inner webs.

1361
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000
First question.

1362
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Jocka is a minimal amount of competent defensive ability soft defense.

1363
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Essentially.

1364
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.000
The most overlooked essential stabilizer of young male psyche.

1365
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So this question.

1366
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000
This actually came across the interwebs as a statement.

1367
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000
An opinion.

1368
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And I kind of rephrase it just a little bit to make it into a question.

1369
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
But it actually came across someone who's in look.

1370
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000
He believes this person believes that they know and how to fight.

1371
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
You know, competent defensive ability.

1372
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:06.000
I call that knowing how to fight is, and he thinks it's the most essential stabilizer of a young male psyche.

1373
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I agree with this statement.

1374
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I think that, yeah, I completely agree with it.

1375
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I think that learning how to fight and knowing how to fight gives you real confidence and security,

1376
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000
not just in the form of being secure, but as a in opposition to insecurity, right?

1377
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Because when you know how to fight, all of a sudden you don't have anything to prove anymore.

1378
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
And this changes.

1379
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
I wish I would have been going to do that a fight and a much more.

1380
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
We fought all the time when I was a kid.

1381
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
We fought.

1382
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000
We did not have a fight.

1383
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So what do we have to prove that we knew how to fight?

1384
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
If we actually knew how to fight, we wouldn't have to prove that all the time.

1385
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
So I absolutely agree with this.

1386
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000
And that's why I'm constantly trying to get people to get energy.

1387
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Get your kids energy, get your 13 year old boy, your 10 year old boy, get him into your jitsu.

1388
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000
You're girl too.

1389
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000
I mean, you're girl too.

1390
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Because your girl's going to use it for defense.

1391
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Girls don't have the constant tension of fighting that guys have.

1392
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
It is part of who we are.

1393
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000
When I shake someone's hand, I don't care what kind of mood I'm thinking about taking them down.

1394
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I'm thinking about what I'm going to do to them in a fight.

1395
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
It doesn't matter from meeting Santa Claus.

1396
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
I'm thinking about doing a double leg.

1397
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
I'm thinking about what is weight is.

1398
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Does he have cauliflower?

1399
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
That's what I'm doing.

1400
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And guys do that.

1401
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Guys do that.

1402
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And it's real.

1403
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And I mean, especially in the environment, I grew up in the civil teams.

1404
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I mean, everybody's got that constant.

1405
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Like tests.

1406
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That's the evaluation.

1407
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So if you don't know how to fight, there's only one way to figure out where you are.

1408
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000
And that is to fight.

1409
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And so you end up doing stupid things.

1410
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Stupid things to prove your your manhood.

1411
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And I hate to use that word.

1412
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
But you end up doing stupid things to prove your manhood.

1413
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000
So my recommendation is, well, I totally agree with this statement.

1414
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
I think it is a huge stabilizer of your personality.

1415
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000
And and your psyche has a man.

1416
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000
So kids get those kids to learn GJitsu.

1417
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000
They're going to understand.

1418
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Violence. You respect it.

1419
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Because you know you've got choked out.

1420
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
You know what's happened.

1421
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
You know that is a horrible feeling.

1422
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
It's a horrible feeling when another human being can control you a hundred percent.

1423
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
You know what?

1424
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Physically it doesn't matter how smart you are anymore.

1425
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.

1426
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000
It doesn't matter.

1427
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
It doesn't matter how smart you are anymore.

1428
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
When you are getting completely physically dominated by someone,

1429
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
it doesn't matter that you are smarter than them.

1430
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
At that time it's nothing you can do about it.

1431
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
You can, what are you going to challenge them to a spelling bee?

1432
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It's not going to help you.

1433
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
You're under there controlling.

1434
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000
That's a horrible horrible feeling.

1435
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
And so I think it's, you know, and I felt that you know when I was a kid,

1436
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
you know, I got bullied just like everybody gets bullied at sort of certain point.

1437
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
You know, you show up to high school.

1438
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000
You're 13 years old.

1439
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I was there.

1440
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I was a young.

1441
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Whatever.

1442
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
However, that works when you are born.

1443
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000
That was born September.

1444
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So I was a young scrawny.

1445
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Kid.

1446
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And I didn't get bullied to some crazy extent.

1447
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
But you get picked on.

1448
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
You get picked on.

1449
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
You get in the little scuffles and you get thrown around by a kid that's that reach

1450
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
puberty when he was nine and he's now, you know, six feet to 20.

1451
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000
And I'm showing up at school 13 years old way in a buck 45.

1452
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000
You're going to get, you're going to get physically controlled.

1453
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And it's not fun.

1454
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And so I didn't know.

1455
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000
I was trying to figure it out.

1456
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
And there was no one to know how to fight back then unless you were a boxer, maybe a wrestler.

1457
01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:01.000
But yeah, so definitely this is a huge piece helps you with, I think, I think kids that know how to fight are going to get in the lost less street fights.

1458
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
They're going to do a lot less stupid things to prove themselves because,

1459
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
guess what, they already have the essential.

1460
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I'm all animalistic characteristic of physical domination and that goes a long way.

1461
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Yeah.

1462
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
And we talked about this before.

1463
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Back to the girls thing, getting your girls into it.

1464
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
You know how when you get into any kind of physical situation, even if you're in a crowd.

1465
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And some of them start shoving someone else, not even you.

1466
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000
And pull them you feel the force of somebody or someone's just all like on you or even if someone like,

1467
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I don't know, tackles you or something like that. It's like this kind of imposed physical situation.

1468
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
And when you're into the Gigi, that's every day.

1469
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
So you get used to that real quick.

1470
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And in fact, you get real comfortable with it.

1471
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
But as a girl, you're not trying to like win fight now.

1472
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000
You know, I know Gigi, so I'm going to try win fights and beat up guys.

1473
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That's not really what it's for for girls.

1474
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000
It's more for knowing how to function, knowing where to be, where not to be because man, if you don't know, you just simply don't know.

1475
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And also being totally right and then also being an accolade to the physical con.

1476
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Yeah, when it happens.

1477
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
So what you say, you can't win, I mean, not looking to win fights.

1478
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
There's go watch YouTube.

1479
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000
There's all kinds of videos of girls just working over guys.

1480
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
And I mean, in street fights, there's one particular where this girls just try to,

1481
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
our mock just choke.

1482
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Just crushing this kid.

1483
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Yeah, well, the truth is, if you learn Gigi, if someone knows Gigi,

1484
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
if someone doesn't, the chance of the person knowing Gigi,

1485
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
who winning the fight is very, very, very high.

1486
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Yes, even if you're a girl, it's still applies to you.

1487
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Of course, the girls at a physical disadvantage could be smaller, weaker, whatever.

1488
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.000
But like I said, Gigi, who's just this huge jump in ability is for his fights go.

1489
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
And you know something else, from a pure self defense perspective,

1490
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
if you, a lot of times, let's say a girl's not able to physically,

1491
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
let's say she's 100 pounds and she's a guy attacks her, that's 200 pounds.

1492
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
She might not be able to put him asleep.

1493
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000
She might not be able to finish him, but she may able to be able to survive,

1494
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000
defend the guy off for a minute and 30 seconds instead of two seconds,

1495
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
instead of four seconds instead of eight seconds.

1496
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
So that's what it takes for someone to hear for someone to see.

1497
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So every second counts.

1498
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
And if you know Gigi, I guarantee you,

1499
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
it's, it's really hard to subdue somebody that knows some Gigi to if you don't know anything.

1500
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
You are going to have a hard time getting control them.

1501
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000
They're going to be, and even if you're stronger than them, you'll be able to get a hold of them.

1502
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Maybe eventually if there are a lot smaller, a lot weaker than you,

1503
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
but it's going to be a fight.

1504
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And a lot of, a lot of you know, you read a lot of stories when in self defense situations,

1505
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
if the girl puts up a decent fight, the guy is not going to have any of it.

1506
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
You know, he's going to realize that he's not looking for that.

1507
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000
He's not looking for a fight.

1508
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
He's looking for something else.

1509
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
And so the fight begins, he backs off.

1510
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
So yeah, absolutely, you know, applies for girls as well.

1511
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And there's just a certain level of confidence.

1512
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
You know, when I've seen that, you know, my son's had a couple little scuffles,

1513
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
a couple that I've witnessed too, where, you know,

1514
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
he just was like not trying to,

1515
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
not trying to have a problem until someone just grabs him.

1516
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
And is obviously going to do trying to do something to him.

1517
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000
And then that person's getting launched, you know, like,

1518
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
a perfect judo, because you're going to, you know,

1519
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
how hard is it to judo throw somebody that doesn't know any judo to do to it?

1520
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
So easy.

1521
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So you see a kid fly through the air, hit the ground.

1522
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
You see my son, you know, just, like, there's no guard passing,

1523
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
because the person doesn't even know what the guard is.

1524
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
So it's just straight to mount.

1525
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And then once you're in mount,

1526
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
the person has no idea what's happening.

1527
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And, and they're completely controlled and they're getting put to sleep.

1528
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
That's it.

1529
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
It's as easy as that.

1530
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Yeah, and it's so funny how you, this is the kind of the part that I forget,

1531
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
actually, every once in a while, where how you brought up

1532
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000
when you shake someone's hand, you're always thinking about it, whatever.

1533
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000
So that's, that's something too. That's why it's almost like if you don't know

1534
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
judo to, like, or for real fighting,

1535
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
there's not many out there, and there's not many, but even,

1536
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
we'll just say, if you don't know judo to,

1537
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
you might fall into this trap by thinking, well, you know,

1538
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I might, you know, you never know.

1539
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
He's not on all the time, or he might not be ready for this,

1540
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
or, you know, all surprised him of the, like,

1541
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
this punch or something like this, and they won't give it its due credit.

1542
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
But the thing is when you learn judo to Brad, that's all you're thinking about.

1543
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
You're like, oh, fuck, I take this guy right here.

1544
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
100% of the time. You can be laying in your, in your bed with your wife,

1545
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
and she'll be like, hey, give me a hug, and you're like,

1546
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
100, 100, 100, there, yes, exactly the whole time.

1547
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So you can't really, to surprise a guy who knows,

1548
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
you just, to surprise him is super hard.

1549
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Like, you gotta do, from behind, I don't know,

1550
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
even if you see him from behind, you know what to do from behind.

1551
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
You know, you gotta, like, I don't know,

1552
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
hit him or something, really hard to knock him out one punch.

1553
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1554
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It's really hard to knock somebody out within the punch for me.

1555
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Yeah, but that's so funny, because that, that is how it is.

1556
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Even as like a high level guy, you're still like,

1557
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000
it's always on your mind.

1558
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Like, it's like you're walking around with this big,

1559
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
powerful, like, gun or something, like you're like,

1560
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
okay, who wants to get shot?

1561
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Not that you want to shoot people specifically,

1562
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
but it's like this radar that's like, okay,

1563
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
who wants to get shot. Kind of thing.

1564
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Because you're just ready, you're just ready to do it.

1565
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Yeah, and to me, honestly, it's so instinctive at this point.

1566
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Yeah, it's just part of every movement that you make is thinking about that.

1567
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000
And you know, you ever had somebody that doesn't know you did to,

1568
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
like, maybe you haven't seen someone in a while.

1569
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I've had that app, what I've seen seen someone for a while.

1570
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Yes.

1571
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And I mean, 20 years.

1572
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
So they have no idea what you did to us.

1573
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
We've got a completely different path in our lives.

1574
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000
And they like, grab hold of you as if it was the old days.

1575
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And you're going to have a tussle and it's edible.

1576
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Yeah, it's just a four second, you know, spirit crushing maneuver of death.

1577
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Yeah.

1578
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
And you're happy to do it too.

1579
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
You know, because as an adult, like, you know,

1580
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I think anywhere past 26, 27 years old,

1581
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
it's hard to get away with like, getting into a wrestling match in public,

1582
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
or, you know, somewhere outside of the map.

1583
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000
That's interesting.

1584
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
You might not have known that.

1585
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
But, yeah.

1586
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
I don't know, I think I speak for more than more people than just myself,

1587
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
but there's a part of your mind that kind of helped it.

1588
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
It happens just with your friend, you know, or something like that.

1589
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Just see, you do it, of course.

1590
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Always, always hoping for a scrap.

1591
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
You know what, ironically, back to the part where we're saying,

1592
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
it's kind of hard to surprise.

1593
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Did you do it to guy ironically?

1594
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
The easiest time to surprise a Jiu-Jitsu guy is on the map.

1595
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000
If you're another Jiu-Jitsu guy, what you do is you play like,

1596
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
oh, we're just going like, right now.

1597
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
And then you go hard.

1598
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
You know, so you can't really surprise them in public.

1599
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
You got to learn Jitsu, go on the map.

1600
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
You know, they'll make them think you're not rolling out.

1601
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Then surprise.

1602
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000
And you know, I think that's part of it is you become more aware.

1603
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
When you're talking, you've been talking about the past couple minutes,

1604
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
is awareness.

1605
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And when you have Jiu-Jitsu in your brain,

1606
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
then it's true with boxing too, and Moetai,

1607
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
when you have that stuff in your brain,

1608
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
then you can't help but be aware of what's happening.

1609
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
And because it's in there.

1610
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And it's like knowing that the color of the table is brown.

1611
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Like you know what that person's body position is.

1612
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000
You're looking and seeing that their stance is off balance.

1613
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
You're seeing an underhook exposed.

1614
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
You know, so you can't help.

1615
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000
You can't take it away.

1616
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
So you're awareness increases.

1617
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000
You also are aware of what problems can occur really quickly.

1618
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
So if you start, you know, if you're a girl,

1619
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
and you say, oh, wait a second, now I'm back into a corner where I can't get out.

1620
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000
I don't like this feeling.

1621
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000
It becomes it increases your awareness as a human.

1622
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
It makes you more aware of your surroundings.

1623
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
So there's so many benefits.

1624
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Yeah.

1625
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
It's kind of ridiculous.

1626
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Yeah, and it kind of, you kind of have almost like one level up from that.

1627
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Or awareness that you're talking about because like how you're saying,

1628
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
it's part of that, even if you don't know how to fight,

1629
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
it's still kind of on your mind.

1630
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000
You know, you like all guys have that kind of sort of sort of evaluate,

1631
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
especially if the guys close to your close to you.

1632
01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Yeah.

1633
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Who you are.

1634
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000
You know, whatever the stage,

1635
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
or whatever the scenario even, like if you're a scholar,

1636
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
and no one else is scholar, then another scholar walks in,

1637
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
woo, this evaluation.

1638
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So that's how it is naturally smart this guy.

1639
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Yeah.

1640
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000
So, oh, so as a guy just naturally,

1641
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
you're going to have even more.

1642
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
It's like, you know what the color brown is or whatever,

1643
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
but just instinctually, you're always looking for brown.

1644
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
That's kind of what it's like.

1645
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
So now you, when you're doing these evaluations that are going to happen anyway,

1646
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
your jujitsu mind is right there at the front.

1647
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Ready?

1648
01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
The whole time.

1649
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Yeah.

1650
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Indeed, just thing.

1651
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Dray magic to people.

1652
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000
But that's not to be confused with like your aggressive and want to fight.

1653
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000
That's the weird thing.

1654
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000
It's like you don't want to actually fight with people because you don't feel the need to like,

1655
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
oh, I got a, I don't know,

1656
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Yeah, you didn't think of it.

1657
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Yeah, that's where the soul conversation started off.

1658
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And also, I do not feel like you need to prove anything,

1659
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
but I literally am like, oh,

1660
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I really want to get a fight with this guy.

1661
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
I'm like, my knuckles, you know,

1662
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000
I'm probably going to rip my t-shirt,

1663
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
this guy's gonna be right there.

1664
01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
This is really no.

1665
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
I fight every single day.

1666
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I don't need,

1667
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I don't care about this guy.

1668
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
This is a two second thing where I got to scuff up my knee on the pavement.

1669
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And he's probably going to rip my shirt.

1670
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000
And that's going to be a pain.

1671
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And I got to deal with the cops if they show up.

1672
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
It's just a big pain.

1673
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Where as if you don't fight and you have that opportunity,

1674
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
maybe you got the thing inside you.

1675
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
You don't know.

1676
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Right.

1677
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
The payoff of the fight, right?

1678
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
If you don't know or if you're just insecure,

1679
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
the payoff of the fight and hopefully winning is bigger than all the

1680
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
detriments that you got to do.

1681
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I obviously tell my puttin guys,

1682
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
will we ever see before the war started?

1683
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Hey, you know, so guys,

1684
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
or overseas, what are you doing?

1685
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000
You're drinking your out and bars,

1686
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
or causing problems or whatever.

1687
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
And I've, you know, before you do that,

1688
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000
I'll be like, hey guys,

1689
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000
if you feel like fighting tonight,

1690
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000
come find me.

1691
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Because if you want to fight, come find me and it'll be all be good.

1692
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
You know, you know, we'll fight.

1693
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And it's all good.

1694
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
You won't get trouble.

1695
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You won't get arrested.

1696
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:52.000
You won't get hurt.

1697
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It's all good.

1698
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000
You'll get a show.

1699
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000
You're not going to get trouble for sure.

1700
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
You're not going to get trouble with the law,

1701
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
though you know what I mean?

1702
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
You're not going to get that kind of trouble.

1703
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
You're going to get trouble in your situation

1704
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and you're in your positioning.

1705
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
It's going to be a trouble soon.

1706
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
So yeah, it's better to fight amongst yourself than to fight against

1707
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000
the outsiders who are going to sue you,

1708
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000
pull a knife out and stab you into throw whatever,

1709
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000
right?

1710
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000
You don't do that.

1711
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Stay out of the street fights.

1712
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Not worth it.

1713
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
You know,

1714
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000
all right.

1715
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
I agree with it too though.

1716
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
I'm going to send you agree that it is the stabilizer.

1717
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
You don't even know how much you don't know.

1718
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
It's funny because we get a lot of people that have started training

1719
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
to get to.

1720
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Good move.

1721
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Yes.

1722
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
But they'll come on Twitter or on on the Facebook.

1723
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
And say,

1724
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000
you know,

1725
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
A is started training to get to.

1726
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Oh my god.

1727
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I can't believe I need to train this all the time.

1728
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I can't believe I got control.

1729
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
They always say how humiliating.

1730
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And sometimes they say humbling.

1731
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But sometimes I think even when they say humbling,

1732
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
they actually mean humiliating because they,

1733
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
you, that's the weird thing.

1734
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
When you're walking around on the earth without the knowledge,

1735
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
you think you look at other people.

1736
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000
You think you know what?

1737
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000
This guy knows,

1738
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Do you get to?

1739
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000
I heard this guy knows,

1740
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
you do it doesn't matter.

1741
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I'm strong.

1742
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I'm athletic.

1743
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
I'll just hit him in the neck or even even even.

1744
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
You know what?

1745
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
I'm just strong enough.

1746
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
He's not going to get my house.

1747
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000
You're going to get my arm over there.

1748
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Yeah.

1749
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
It's not going to work.

1750
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I'll just pull my arm back.

1751
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And you get on the mat.

1752
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:19.000
You go,

1753
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Oh my lord.

1754
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
I have no control over this situation.

1755
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000
This guy is effortlessly making me submit over and over and over again.

1756
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
That's when the reality hits.

1757
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
The reality hits doesn't end on the first time you tap.

1758
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Because on the first time you tap you go,

1759
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Oh, I'm, I'm going to,

1760
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000
I'll just,

1761
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I won't do that single movement again.

1762
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I won't stick my head over there.

1763
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Okay.

1764
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
So then you get your arm locked.

1765
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Yeah.

1766
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000
And then you get your foot locked.

1767
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And then you get your knee locked.

1768
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.000
And then you get your knee locked.

1769
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And then you get your knee.

1770
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.000
And then you get your knee.

1771
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
G-atine again.

1772
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Then you get your,

1773
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000
So you,

1774
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
It's just a lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose.

1775
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
And then you go after,

1776
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Usually it for me.

1777
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
It's like three to five times with somebody that's never trained to get to before three to five times before they realize like,

1778
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Oh, I'm never,

1779
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Because you know,

1780
01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
When you tap a guy once that's never trained before.

1781
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And he comes at you so hard again.

1782
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
He's mind.

1783
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:02.000
He thinks,

1784
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
And this time I'm going to get him.

1785
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Yeah.

1786
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And then we even come close.

1787
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000
They don't even realize.

1788
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Yeah.

1789
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:07.000
So yeah,

1790
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Get on the mat man and learn learn the jjitsu.

1791
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Yeah.

1792
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Please cover the over,

1793
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
or please cover overcoming the frustrations of beginning to jjitsu.

1794
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
And this is coming from a 54 year old, by the way,

1795
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
But not quitting.

1796
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Good, good for him.

1797
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000
That's awesome.

1798
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Glad you're picking up the jjitsu a 54 years old.

1799
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Okay.

1800
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
So how do you, the frustrations of beginning jjitsu?

1801
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000
And it is absolutely.

1802
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
If you have the wrong mindset,

1803
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
It's viciously frustrating.

1804
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Because of everything we just talked about.

1805
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
And you think,

1806
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Oh, I'll just do this.

1807
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
It's cold a bit harder.

1808
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
And I just won't put my arm there.

1809
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
And then I'll be able to win.

1810
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
You're not going to win.

1811
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000
You are going to lose.

1812
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000
You're going to lose over and over and over again.

1813
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
To people that are smaller than you.

1814
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Weakier than you.

1815
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Not as tough as you are.

1816
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Literally not as tough as you are.

1817
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Yeah.

1818
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Not as tough as you are.

1819
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
You know, jjitsu has a faction of, of,

1820
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Gnords for lack of a better word.

1821
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Straight nerds.

1822
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
And no offense to the nerds out there.

1823
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000
But, you know,

1824
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
people that are not physically active.

1825
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000
And then some for some reason they fall into jjitsu at some point.

1826
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
And they, and they also,

1827
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
They've got a guy that's not tough.

1828
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
But they'll know the moves and I'll finish you.

1829
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
So that's so those the people you're going to lose to.

1830
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:28.000
So and it's a, it's a long, long, slow journey that takes a long time.

1831
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Now that being said,

1832
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
If you train for a month and someone's train zero,

1833
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
that journey is not that long.

1834
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You'll be that guy.

1835
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Yeah.

1836
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
You will beat that guy.

1837
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
I mean, you know, again,

1838
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
you take two people.

1839
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
One of them knows jjitsu for a month.

1840
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
And one of them doesn't.

1841
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
That guy's going to win.

1842
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I mean, you know,

1843
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000
it's basically the same way,

1844
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
it's the same, you know,

1845
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
you can't have so many that's completely weak.

1846
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
But in six months,

1847
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
you're beating anybody that's untrained for the,

1848
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
you're beating 95% that maybe you're 99% that people are untrained.

1849
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
But as far as,

1850
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
like,

1851
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
you think you show up and in six months,

1852
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
you're going to be beating a blue belt.

1853
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
It's not happening.

1854
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Yeah.

1855
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Yeah.

1856
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
It's not happening.

1857
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
A beating a purple belt is not happening.

1858
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
You're not going to catch a purple belt in,

1859
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000
in your first two or three years.

1860
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Unless you got to somebody that doesn't.

1861
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Or he lets you.

1862
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Yeah.

1863
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Of course.

1864
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Yeah.

1865
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:26.000
In like,

1866
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Glover,

1867
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
he'll, he'll let people put him in all kind of,

1868
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000
I mean, he does that in companies.

1869
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
He just saw that I've met him more.

1870
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000
So he's,

1871
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1872
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1873
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1874
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1875
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1876
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1877
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1878
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1879
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1880
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1881
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1882
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1883
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1884
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1885
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1886
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1887
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1888
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1889
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1890
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1891
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1892
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000
he's,

1893
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
he's,

1894
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000
that's all kinds of crazy things happen.

1895
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:35.000
So yeah,

1896
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
can that happen of course,

1897
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
but as far as legitimately,

1898
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
taking someone down.

1899
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Yeah.

1900
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
It's not going to happen.

1901
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000
So, so that's all that's what I'm saying,

1902
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000
as long as,

1903
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000
slowly,

1904
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
slowly.

1905
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Especially two because,

1906
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
everyone's on that bus.

1907
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000
We've talked about this before.

1908
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Everyone's on the bus getting better.

1909
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So that blue belt that started that you started six months behind,

1910
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
or a year behind.

1911
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
So he's a blue belt.

1912
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000
You're a year behind him.

1913
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
He's not stopping getting better.

1914
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
So, as you start to pursue

1915
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:01.000
his game.

1916
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.84
changing and improving so you're not going to get there.

1917
02:01:04.84 --> 02:01:09.08
And then on top of that, when you do learn something new,

1918
02:01:09.08 --> 02:01:11.08
it takes time to incorporate into your game.

1919
02:01:11.08 --> 02:01:14.08
So if I taught you echo a new move tonight,

1920
02:01:14.08 --> 02:01:15.28
as it hit here's this cool,

1921
02:01:15.28 --> 02:01:18.28
it's here's this new setup for the Armlock

1922
02:01:18.28 --> 02:01:20.24
and we drilled it 10 times.

1923
02:01:20.24 --> 02:01:22.64
And you went now and started to apply that,

1924
02:01:22.64 --> 02:01:25.08
it would make your game worse.

1925
02:01:25.08 --> 02:01:26.96
Because you'd be trying to apply a move

1926
02:01:26.96 --> 02:01:28.88
that you don't know 100% yet.

1927
02:01:28.88 --> 02:01:30.68
Like you got some good solid moves

1928
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:32.76
that you do and those are, you know,

1929
02:01:32.76 --> 02:01:34.40
those work really well.

1930
02:01:34.40 --> 02:01:36.72
So when you start incorporating this new move,

1931
02:01:36.72 --> 02:01:38.20
you don't know it well.

1932
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:40.08
You don't get it all together.

1933
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:42.64
So you're gonna fail out at 100 times.

1934
02:01:42.64 --> 02:01:44.84
It's not gonna work 100 times before you get it.

1935
02:01:44.84 --> 02:01:46.36
And by the way, every time you try to do it on me,

1936
02:01:46.36 --> 02:01:47.88
I got on top and then I smashed you.

1937
02:01:47.88 --> 02:01:49.80
And then I, so you're, you're sacrificing

1938
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:50.96
and it's in every time.

1939
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:52.84
So you're actually going backwards a little bit

1940
02:01:52.84 --> 02:01:54.36
before you can go forward.

1941
02:01:54.36 --> 02:01:57.52
So that's problematic and that's very, very frustrating.

1942
02:01:57.52 --> 02:01:59.80
Occasionally you might learn something that,

1943
02:01:59.80 --> 02:02:01.64
like, really improves your game dramatically,

1944
02:02:01.64 --> 02:02:03.60
almost instantly that happens from time to time.

1945
02:02:03.60 --> 02:02:05.52
So we'll say, hey, put your own position here

1946
02:02:05.52 --> 02:02:08.000
or hey, you know, whatever the case may be.

1947
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.80
But generally when you incorporate something new,

1948
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:10.80
it can take some time.

1949
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.64
You're gonna get injuries.

1950
02:02:13.64 --> 02:02:14.64
You're gonna get little injuries.

1951
02:02:14.64 --> 02:02:15.64
You're gonna get big injuries.

1952
02:02:15.64 --> 02:02:16.64
You're gonna be sore.

1953
02:02:16.64 --> 02:02:18.60
You're gonna, so yes, you will be frustrated.

1954
02:02:18.60 --> 02:02:20.16
So how do you counter all that?

1955
02:02:20.16 --> 02:02:21.44
You just gotta embrace it.

1956
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:23.60
You gotta embrace all those things.

1957
02:02:23.60 --> 02:02:25.84
You gotta enjoy all those things.

1958
02:02:26.92 --> 02:02:27.92
And I hate to be cliche,

1959
02:02:27.92 --> 02:02:29.60
but you gotta enjoy the journey.

1960
02:02:29.60 --> 02:02:32.68
You gotta enjoy getting tapped out by somebody

1961
02:02:32.68 --> 02:02:35.08
that's a, be amazed by that.

1962
02:02:35.08 --> 02:02:37.36
Say, dang, how did that just happen?

1963
02:02:37.36 --> 02:02:38.44
That is impressive.

1964
02:02:38.44 --> 02:02:41.84
You know, say, hey, got a little war scar on my face.

1965
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:43.44
I got split the eye open.

1966
02:02:43.44 --> 02:02:44.28
Okay, cool.

1967
02:02:44.28 --> 02:02:45.28
Chick's takes scars.

1968
02:02:45.28 --> 02:02:46.12
You know what I mean?

1969
02:02:46.12 --> 02:02:50.32
Just gonna go, don't, don't, don't look at all that stuff

1970
02:02:50.32 --> 02:02:51.16
as negative.

1971
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:52.72
Look at it as, you know what I'm saying?

1972
02:02:52.72 --> 02:02:54.96
Don't rush to the end.

1973
02:02:54.96 --> 02:02:55.92
Don't rush to the end.

1974
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:57.28
Don't be in rush to get there.

1975
02:02:57.28 --> 02:02:59.56
Take your time and enjoy the sights

1976
02:02:59.56 --> 02:03:01.04
that you're gonna go for.

1977
02:03:01.04 --> 02:03:03.12
Also, I've said this before.

1978
02:03:04.12 --> 02:03:05.68
Select your training partners carefully,

1979
02:03:05.68 --> 02:03:07.36
especially like your 54 years old.

1980
02:03:07.36 --> 02:03:09.32
You don't wanna be wrong with the 20 year old

1981
02:03:09.32 --> 02:03:10.40
to stay right freak.

1982
02:03:10.40 --> 02:03:12.64
That's going white belt trying to kill you.

1983
02:03:12.64 --> 02:03:15.68
You wanna be wrong with a cool, mellow,

1984
02:03:15.68 --> 02:03:20.68
purple belt that's wants to do GJ2 and train.

1985
02:03:20.68 --> 02:03:25.28
And finally, I would just say, remember that GJ2

1986
02:03:25.28 --> 02:03:26.92
should be fun.

1987
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:28.20
It should be all those other things,

1988
02:03:28.20 --> 02:03:29.60
all those frustrated, all those challenges,

1989
02:03:29.60 --> 02:03:31.80
all those things, all that humiliation and humor

1990
02:03:31.80 --> 02:03:34.20
and getting humbled, but it should be a good time.

1991
02:03:34.20 --> 02:03:35.84
You should have fun when you're doing GJ2.

1992
02:03:35.84 --> 02:03:36.68
I know I do.

1993
02:03:36.68 --> 02:03:38.84
Yeah, yeah, like a video game, right?

1994
02:03:38.84 --> 02:03:41.76
I mean, you can get down for a couple of days, man.

1995
02:03:41.76 --> 02:03:43.20
And I came back and had an injury

1996
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:44.92
that I figured out, took me a little while,

1997
02:03:44.92 --> 02:03:46.16
I got my jacked up finger.

1998
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:49.56
It took me a little while to get the right,

1999
02:03:49.56 --> 02:03:53.92
get the right apparatus to splint it properly and protect it,

2000
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:58.08
but tonight I train and I was so happy.

2001
02:03:58.08 --> 02:04:02.08
I was so happy going in on the mat just saying yes.

2002
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:05.52
Yeah, that is how we're all these,

2003
02:04:05.52 --> 02:04:08.56
all the junk parts that come with it were,

2004
02:04:08.56 --> 02:04:11.08
cool, don't cool, junk, you know, like the four-ness,

2005
02:04:11.08 --> 02:04:13.04
yeah, I got choked out of where,

2006
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:15.68
that's all part of the game, seems obvious, right?

2007
02:04:15.68 --> 02:04:16.80
Yeah, it's all part of the game,

2008
02:04:16.80 --> 02:04:19.24
but be happy that that's the game you're in.

2009
02:04:19.24 --> 02:04:20.84
I mean, GJ2, basic, I mean, if you don't,

2010
02:04:20.84 --> 02:04:24.56
do GJ2, this would be kind of an insight.

2011
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:27.28
Basically, all it is, if you go to a class,

2012
02:04:27.28 --> 02:04:29.72
you go in, you may or may not warm up,

2013
02:04:29.72 --> 02:04:32.80
you learn a move, whether it be a submission move,

2014
02:04:32.80 --> 02:04:34.60
just a move, you learn a move, two moves,

2015
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:36.52
three moves, somethings, four moves,

2016
02:04:36.52 --> 02:04:38.64
and then you cut to roll in.

2017
02:04:38.64 --> 02:04:40.64
Straight up, you guys are fighting, no strikes,

2018
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:42.56
that's it, you're fighting, no strikes.

2019
02:04:42.56 --> 02:04:44.12
If you, whatever moves you know,

2020
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:46.48
go ahead and do them while in real life,

2021
02:04:46.48 --> 02:04:47.96
against this guy, that's it.

2022
02:04:47.96 --> 02:04:50.32
If you don't know it, if that's your first day,

2023
02:04:50.32 --> 02:04:53.24
and you learn one, two, three moves that first day,

2024
02:04:53.24 --> 02:04:54.64
you better try to do those moves.

2025
02:04:54.64 --> 02:04:55.48
That's it.

2026
02:04:55.48 --> 02:04:56.96
So of course, you know, two, three moves

2027
02:04:56.96 --> 02:04:58.96
that you learned once, by the way,

2028
02:04:58.96 --> 02:05:00.16
and you're roll with someone who,

2029
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:02.04
even if he's still a wipe out to whatever,

2030
02:05:02.04 --> 02:05:04.20
he knows those moves and then three, four more,

2031
02:05:04.20 --> 02:05:06.88
and he's practiced some in real time or whatever.

2032
02:05:06.88 --> 02:05:08.32
Of course, he's gonna get you.

2033
02:05:08.32 --> 02:05:09.60
That's just how it works.

2034
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:11.12
But keep in mind, the more you go,

2035
02:05:11.12 --> 02:05:12.84
the more you do the moves, the more moves you learn,

2036
02:05:12.84 --> 02:05:14.40
the more you practice some in real life,

2037
02:05:14.40 --> 02:05:15.92
the better you get at him.

2038
02:05:15.92 --> 02:05:18.88
And you know, let's go ahead and just apply this to life as well.

2039
02:05:18.88 --> 02:05:20.88
Because GJ2 is such a great metaphor for life.

2040
02:05:22.20 --> 02:05:25.68
Whatever you're doing, whatever goal you're trying to achieve.

2041
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:27.60
If you're letting those frustrations,

2042
02:05:27.60 --> 02:05:28.44
when you hit those obstacles,

2043
02:05:28.44 --> 02:05:31.12
if you're letting them control you and get you down,

2044
02:05:31.12 --> 02:05:33.000
that's the wrong attitude to have.

2045
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.56
Look at it as a learning opportunity.

2046
02:05:34.56 --> 02:05:36.44
Look at it as something that's good to tapping,

2047
02:05:36.44 --> 02:05:39.68
look at it as a chance for you to try something new,

2048
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:42.60
look at it as the journey that you're trying to,

2049
02:05:42.60 --> 02:05:45.80
and by the way, anything that's easy to achieve,

2050
02:05:45.80 --> 02:05:46.92
and you don't hit me obstacles,

2051
02:05:46.92 --> 02:05:48.32
well, that's not worth it, right?

2052
02:05:48.32 --> 02:05:51.04
That's not gonna get the full satisfaction

2053
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:52.40
that you want out of that.

2054
02:05:52.40 --> 02:05:56.44
So in life as in GJ2,

2055
02:05:56.44 --> 02:05:59.72
don't get frustrated, embrace those challenges

2056
02:05:59.72 --> 02:06:03.72
because those are what is making this goal worthwhile.

2057
02:06:03.72 --> 02:06:06.24
Yeah, man, I'm telling you when you,

2058
02:06:06.24 --> 02:06:10.000
let's say you, we'll back to the avoiding frustrations,

2059
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.24
specifically, it does how you're saying training partners,

2060
02:06:13.24 --> 02:06:14.52
that does make a big difference.

2061
02:06:14.52 --> 02:06:15.76
Because sometimes, every once in a while,

2062
02:06:15.76 --> 02:06:19.80
I've heard of people where their schedule doesn't allow them

2063
02:06:19.80 --> 02:06:22.28
to catch the big in a class for example.

2064
02:06:22.28 --> 02:06:23.32
So they're like, hey, I've no choice,

2065
02:06:23.32 --> 02:06:25.60
I gotta do this more intermediate or advanced class.

2066
02:06:25.60 --> 02:06:29.16
So they're the only white belt and the next guy

2067
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:31.72
even closest to him is like, advanced blue belt.

2068
02:06:31.72 --> 02:06:35.44
So that's gonna be a steep learning curve,

2069
02:06:35.44 --> 02:06:36.32
it's gonna be tough,

2070
02:06:36.32 --> 02:06:38.36
because how are you gonna practice your moves

2071
02:06:38.36 --> 02:06:39.20
in the wild?

2072
02:06:39.20 --> 02:06:40.56
You won't get to work your offense.

2073
02:06:40.56 --> 02:06:41.40
Yeah, that's really fun.

2074
02:06:41.40 --> 02:06:44.20
Here's kind of the good thing, you get to work your defense.

2075
02:06:44.20 --> 02:06:46.64
So once you do get the opportunity to exercise

2076
02:06:46.64 --> 02:06:48.60
like your offense, whether you get another class

2077
02:06:48.60 --> 02:06:50.60
or it just comes, but just takes longer, whatever,

2078
02:06:50.60 --> 02:06:52.32
but how good your defense is gonna be?

2079
02:06:52.32 --> 02:06:54.84
Yeah, and I actually, so from training with Dean

2080
02:06:54.84 --> 02:06:56.000
for so many years,

2081
02:06:57.16 --> 02:07:00.08
he's just got some positions that are brutal,

2082
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:01.36
brutal positions.

2083
02:07:01.36 --> 02:07:04.40
And, for instance, his mount is outstanding.

2084
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:05.96
When he gets the mount,

2085
02:07:05.96 --> 02:07:09.68
when anybody else that I've ever trained within my life

2086
02:07:09.68 --> 02:07:13.16
has mounted with the exception, I guess, of Hicks and Gracie,

2087
02:07:13.16 --> 02:07:15.76
I felt like, oh, it's not Dean, this is not,

2088
02:07:15.76 --> 02:07:17.56
you know, this is not the whole of this area.

2089
02:07:17.56 --> 02:07:18.96
Right, and not that I'm not that worried,

2090
02:07:18.96 --> 02:07:21.52
I'm not trying to degrade people I've trained with,

2091
02:07:21.52 --> 02:07:23.92
but that is a green has an incredible mount.

2092
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:27.16
And on top of that, Dean kind of knows my escapes.

2093
02:07:27.16 --> 02:07:29.96
So whereas if I roll with a random other really good,

2094
02:07:29.96 --> 02:07:32.16
you know, world of class, black belt,

2095
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.000
they might not know the particulars of my escape,

2096
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.80
Dean actually does know those,

2097
02:07:35.80 --> 02:07:37.60
and he's good at it.

2098
02:07:37.60 --> 02:07:40.12
So, so you're right in that,

2099
02:07:40.12 --> 02:07:42.04
the more you train with people that are better than you,

2100
02:07:42.04 --> 02:07:44.44
your defense is gonna be very good,

2101
02:07:44.44 --> 02:07:46.80
because like when you mount me,

2102
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:48.04
I mean, you got a good solid mount,

2103
02:07:48.04 --> 02:07:50.56
but I'm like, I'm like, okay, cool,

2104
02:07:50.56 --> 02:07:51.60
I'm gonna be out of this and I'll,

2105
02:07:51.60 --> 02:07:54.24
in a short period of time with no real threats.

2106
02:07:54.24 --> 02:07:55.08
Keep telling me.

2107
02:07:55.08 --> 02:07:58.12
And, and the, you've had, I mean,

2108
02:07:58.12 --> 02:07:59.08
I'm sure it's the same way,

2109
02:07:59.08 --> 02:08:00.36
if you've had Dean mounted on you,

2110
02:08:00.36 --> 02:08:02.48
I mean, my mount, because I don't have a great mount,

2111
02:08:02.48 --> 02:08:06.12
my mount is nothing compared to Dean's, nothing.

2112
02:08:06.12 --> 02:08:09.28
Yeah, yeah, fully, yeah, and that's absolutely true.

2113
02:08:09.28 --> 02:08:13.80
And at the same time though, so if you fall in,

2114
02:08:13.80 --> 02:08:15.76
and I don't wanna say it's like a small,

2115
02:08:15.76 --> 02:08:18.28
because it's pretty big chance where if you enter a beginner class,

2116
02:08:18.28 --> 02:08:21.52
there's gonna be a guy who's just as much of a beginner as you,

2117
02:08:21.52 --> 02:08:23.92
and that's where you can really flourish,

2118
02:08:23.92 --> 02:08:28.000
because you can practice moves, your new moves,

2119
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.40
which I mean, for lack of a better term,

2120
02:08:29.40 --> 02:08:30.68
your junk moves, you know,

2121
02:08:30.68 --> 02:08:31.84
on junk people.

2122
02:08:31.84 --> 02:08:33.68
I will say this though.

2123
02:08:33.68 --> 02:08:36.60
Whoever you roll with, whether they're worse than you,

2124
02:08:36.60 --> 02:08:37.84
the same as you are better than you,

2125
02:08:37.84 --> 02:08:38.96
you're gonna get a lot out of it.

2126
02:08:38.96 --> 02:08:40.000
Of course, all three of them.

2127
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.28
So you should roll with all three of those types of people.

2128
02:08:42.28 --> 02:08:46.08
I have a tendency to wanna usually roll with guys

2129
02:08:46.08 --> 02:08:49.24
that are, you know, like good,

2130
02:08:49.24 --> 02:08:52.24
and I should spend more, and I do,

2131
02:08:52.24 --> 02:08:53.76
I mean, I definitely, I train with everybody

2132
02:08:53.76 --> 02:08:55.52
that we got at the gym, all training everybody.

2133
02:08:55.52 --> 02:08:58.40
But I always prefer, of course.

2134
02:08:58.40 --> 02:08:59.40
I guess I shouldn't say, of course,

2135
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:01.20
because there are people that are like white,

2136
02:09:01.20 --> 02:09:02.20
belt hunters.

2137
02:09:02.20 --> 02:09:05.72
Yeah, I wanna go out there and be bullies.

2138
02:09:05.72 --> 02:09:07.84
I'm not like that, I'd rather get bullied, right?

2139
02:09:07.84 --> 02:09:10.08
I wanna get, I wanna feel the,

2140
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:11.56
I wanna get after it, you know?

2141
02:09:11.56 --> 02:09:12.72
Yeah.

2142
02:09:12.72 --> 02:09:15.48
But you definitely get benefit from training

2143
02:09:15.48 --> 02:09:16.96
with people that are better than you,

2144
02:09:16.96 --> 02:09:18.64
worse than you, and the same as you.

2145
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:20.76
Because you practice one of them,

2146
02:09:20.76 --> 02:09:21.88
you're practicing defense,

2147
02:09:21.88 --> 02:09:23.40
one of them, you're practicing pure offense,

2148
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:24.60
and someone that's equal than you,

2149
02:09:24.60 --> 02:09:26.04
you guys are practicing your setups,

2150
02:09:26.04 --> 02:09:29.40
and your approaches, and you gotta learn how to defend,

2151
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:31.44
and do offense and defense at the same time.

2152
02:09:31.44 --> 02:09:34.04
So it's all good, bro.

2153
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:35.74
That's basically the concept here,

2154
02:09:35.74 --> 02:09:38.72
bro. Yes, get after it, consider that scenario,

2155
02:09:38.72 --> 02:09:40.92
bro with, and you're talking from an ideal standpoint,

2156
02:09:40.92 --> 02:09:42.26
bro, with people better than you, same as you,

2157
02:09:42.26 --> 02:09:45.22
worse than you, or you know, not as good as you.

2158
02:09:45.22 --> 02:09:47.12
For a beginner, that's not really the option.

2159
02:09:47.12 --> 02:09:49.02
The worst thing you guys, that's not an option

2160
02:09:49.02 --> 02:09:51.20
for a beginner, really, and also,

2161
02:09:51.20 --> 02:09:52.32
there's no one to support them.

2162
02:09:52.32 --> 02:09:55.66
Well, as far as overcoming the frustrations or whatever,

2163
02:09:55.66 --> 02:09:58.000
it is a good situation where you can get in

2164
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.04
with guys, just as beginner as you.

2165
02:10:00.04 --> 02:10:03.72
And I hope that they hang around this after a certain

2166
02:10:03.72 --> 02:10:05.40
amount of time, those guys who aren't,

2167
02:10:05.40 --> 02:10:08.48
as new or, or, I could, I could see where it could

2168
02:10:08.48 --> 02:10:09.68
become frustrating.

2169
02:10:09.68 --> 02:10:11.32
If you were the guy that you're someone

2170
02:10:11.32 --> 02:10:13.48
earlier, let's say a guy that's, you have to work late,

2171
02:10:13.48 --> 02:10:15.36
and you can only go to the advanced class.

2172
02:10:15.36 --> 02:10:16.60
And all of the sudden, you think you're

2173
02:10:16.60 --> 02:10:18.12
just just getting crushed.

2174
02:10:18.12 --> 02:10:20.08
Yes, and I can't learn this, really.

2175
02:10:20.08 --> 02:10:21.22
Yeah, you know, it's like I'm getting

2176
02:10:21.22 --> 02:10:24.32
distanced to understand, but yeah, that's, that's a good point.

2177
02:10:24.32 --> 02:10:27.000
So keep in mind that if you're in that situation,

2178
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.08
it's okay, you're gonna, you're gonna,

2179
02:10:29.08 --> 02:10:31.000
when you eventually get to roll with people

2180
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.20
that are more your skill level,

2181
02:10:33.20 --> 02:10:36.52
you will be, you'll be that much better off.

2182
02:10:36.52 --> 02:10:38.76
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

2183
02:10:38.76 --> 02:10:40.76
And, and watch the first time you tap someone out

2184
02:10:40.76 --> 02:10:42.000
with a move that you learned.

2185
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:42.84
Oh.

2186
02:10:42.84 --> 02:10:44.16
Oh.

2187
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:46.84
Celebrate that, did you?

2188
02:10:46.84 --> 02:10:48.72
Yeah, that's a good, it's a good time.

2189
02:10:48.72 --> 02:10:50.96
It's a terrible one.

2190
02:10:50.96 --> 02:10:52.96
Next question.

2191
02:10:52.96 --> 02:10:56.12
Jockel, how do you balance the idea of checking the

2192
02:10:56.12 --> 02:10:59.04
ego while in an interview scenario where you need to

2193
02:10:59.04 --> 02:11:00.88
talk about yourself?

2194
02:11:00.88 --> 02:11:03.28
Okay, so good question.

2195
02:11:03.28 --> 02:11:06.16
I would say in that situation,

2196
02:11:06.16 --> 02:11:08.88
then that's something that it's not just an interview

2197
02:11:08.88 --> 02:11:10.88
situation where you're gonna need to do that.

2198
02:11:10.88 --> 02:11:12.56
I mean, you're dealing with your, your,

2199
02:11:13.76 --> 02:11:17.24
superiors, you know, throughout the course of your career,

2200
02:11:17.24 --> 02:11:19.60
whatever that may be, you're constantly interacting

2201
02:11:19.60 --> 02:11:23.44
with people and you're gonna want to make an impression.

2202
02:11:23.44 --> 02:11:26.56
So I think one of the best ways to do this is

2203
02:11:26.56 --> 02:11:31.56
instead of you speaking about why you're so awesome,

2204
02:11:32.16 --> 02:11:36.16
just state facts of, let's say accomplishments

2205
02:11:36.16 --> 02:11:38.96
and let them speak for themselves.

2206
02:11:40.92 --> 02:11:44.56
In other words, you know, you wouldn't wanna say,

2207
02:11:46.12 --> 02:11:49.12
I am the best project manager in the entire world.

2208
02:11:49.12 --> 02:11:50.28
Mm-hmm.

2209
02:11:50.28 --> 02:11:55.28
Right, that's not, that sounds ego centric.

2210
02:11:55.28 --> 02:11:58.48
You know, instead you'd say, you know,

2211
02:11:58.48 --> 02:12:01.08
I got this, we had a $38 million project,

2212
02:12:01.08 --> 02:12:03.44
got it done on time, under budget,

2213
02:12:03.44 --> 02:12:05.80
ahead of schedule and when I got done with that,

2214
02:12:05.80 --> 02:12:07.96
when they moved me to another project that was off track,

2215
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:11.76
and we got that one back on schedule and back on track as well.

2216
02:12:11.76 --> 02:12:14.12
So that's the kind of experience that I've had

2217
02:12:14.12 --> 02:12:16.12
and I love to bring that here to this company.

2218
02:12:16.12 --> 02:12:17.92
Right, so you're not, you're not,

2219
02:12:19.36 --> 02:12:22.20
you know, there's a hint of, hey, this is what I did.

2220
02:12:22.20 --> 02:12:24.80
I can get some stuff done, but you're not saying, listen,

2221
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:26.92
I'm better than the people you currently have,

2222
02:12:26.92 --> 02:12:28.36
so you should hire me because I'm the best,

2223
02:12:28.36 --> 02:12:29.80
because you don't wanna be that.

2224
02:12:31.24 --> 02:12:35.60
And you know, so yeah, just build, think about it

2225
02:12:35.60 --> 02:12:38.72
you know, before you go in, what, what experience

2226
02:12:38.72 --> 02:12:42.32
that you have represents the good qualities that you have.

2227
02:12:42.32 --> 02:12:44.88
So then you can say, if they say, you know,

2228
02:12:44.88 --> 02:12:46.72
how are you at meeting timelines?

2229
02:12:46.72 --> 02:12:48.92
You don't say, I am perfect and I never late.

2230
02:12:48.92 --> 02:12:49.72
I'm dope.

2231
02:12:49.72 --> 02:12:52.72
You just say, you say, well, you know,

2232
02:12:52.72 --> 02:12:55.84
as far as meeting timelines, here's a bunch of projects

2233
02:12:55.84 --> 02:12:58.24
that I got completed on time, the only one that I missed

2234
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:00.16
was one that we had to roll back as whatever,

2235
02:13:00.16 --> 02:13:02.000
that we are actually showing a little bit more humility.

2236
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.16
You're saying, hey, here's what happened.

2237
02:13:03.16 --> 02:13:04.44
You're being logical about it.

2238
02:13:04.44 --> 02:13:05.64
And you know, speaking of that,

2239
02:13:05.64 --> 02:13:08.48
I actually got a good question that's similar to this one

2240
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:13.72
about what's the best way to interview people

2241
02:13:13.72 --> 02:13:17.08
to see if they can be in a leadership position.

2242
02:13:17.08 --> 02:13:19.16
And this is really hard, this is really hard,

2243
02:13:19.16 --> 02:13:21.52
because it's really hard to interview,

2244
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:23.48
and working at work with all kinds of different companies.

2245
02:13:23.48 --> 02:13:25.08
And everybody always says, you know, hey,

2246
02:13:25.08 --> 02:13:26.20
what's the best way to interview?

2247
02:13:26.20 --> 02:13:28.72
And man, I interviewed this guy and he seemed so great

2248
02:13:28.72 --> 02:13:30.92
or I interviewed this woman and she seemed incredible

2249
02:13:30.92 --> 02:13:33.08
and her paper looked great, you know,

2250
02:13:33.08 --> 02:13:34.60
she looked great on paper and we hired her

2251
02:13:34.60 --> 02:13:36.76
and she's a disaster or he's a disaster,

2252
02:13:36.76 --> 02:13:38.04
whatever the case may be.

2253
02:13:38.04 --> 02:13:41.08
Because there's people that are very good interviewer.

2254
02:13:41.08 --> 02:13:43.24
She's right, I mean, there's people that can interview you well.

2255
02:13:43.24 --> 02:13:46.24
They have the gift the gap, they can be us their way

2256
02:13:46.24 --> 02:13:48.12
through anything and make themselves sound good.

2257
02:13:48.12 --> 02:13:52.20
So it can be really hard to identify if someone's good

2258
02:13:52.20 --> 02:13:55.48
is actually gonna be fit for a leadership,

2259
02:13:55.48 --> 02:13:56.96
it's not really any position.

2260
02:13:56.96 --> 02:13:59.72
So one of the things that I always tell people to do

2261
02:13:59.72 --> 02:14:02.32
is when you go into these, when you wanna ask interview questions,

2262
02:14:02.32 --> 02:14:05.04
ask them scenario-based questions.

2263
02:14:05.04 --> 02:14:06.72
And say, okay, here's what's going on.

2264
02:14:06.72 --> 02:14:09.76
You got these three people in your department

2265
02:14:09.76 --> 02:14:14.24
and one of the people has come to you

2266
02:14:14.24 --> 02:14:16.28
and said that they think there might be something

2267
02:14:16.28 --> 02:14:18.96
illegal going on with the other two.

2268
02:14:18.96 --> 02:14:20.48
What actions do you take?

2269
02:14:20.48 --> 02:14:22.68
And you know, have a scenario built out

2270
02:14:22.68 --> 02:14:24.28
that you can actually talk through

2271
02:14:24.28 --> 02:14:26.40
and see where they go and see what their mind said is

2272
02:14:26.40 --> 02:14:28.12
and see what they're gonna develop as a plan

2273
02:14:28.12 --> 02:14:29.24
and see how they would actually plan.

2274
02:14:29.24 --> 02:14:34.20
So it's a great way of figuring out how people think.

2275
02:14:34.20 --> 02:14:37.40
And then, you know, even that's not a guarantee

2276
02:14:37.40 --> 02:14:41.20
because there's people that can navigate those type of answers

2277
02:14:41.20 --> 02:14:42.04
as well.

2278
02:14:42.04 --> 02:14:43.60
So you know, one thing you can do is hire people

2279
02:14:43.60 --> 02:14:45.000
on a little bit of a trial basis.

2280
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.52
And that can be difficult in some situations

2281
02:14:46.52 --> 02:14:47.92
where people are walking away from one job

2282
02:14:47.92 --> 02:14:49.12
and two other job and they're not gonna do it

2283
02:14:49.12 --> 02:14:50.80
on a 90 day trial basis.

2284
02:14:50.80 --> 02:14:51.92
But when you do have that opportunity,

2285
02:14:51.92 --> 02:14:53.36
it's a good thing to do as well.

2286
02:14:55.32 --> 02:14:57.92
But hey, so going back to the first question

2287
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:00.92
about keeping your ego in check and an interview,

2288
02:15:00.92 --> 02:15:04.28
like I said, be confident but not cocky

2289
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:06.84
and let the facts of your experience

2290
02:15:06.84 --> 02:15:11.84
speak for your abilities rather than be it in your own chest.

2291
02:15:11.84 --> 02:15:13.76
Be it in your own chest.

2292
02:15:13.76 --> 02:15:15.12
Yeah, so it's almost like,

2293
02:15:15.12 --> 02:15:16.56
I mean, correct me from wrong here.

2294
02:15:16.56 --> 02:15:21.24
So you essentially, even if you're talking yourself up,

2295
02:15:21.24 --> 02:15:24.16
you just simply state the facts.

2296
02:15:24.16 --> 02:15:25.000
That's it.

2297
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:25.84
You just state the facts.

2298
02:15:25.84 --> 02:15:26.84
Don't say you're opinion about it.

2299
02:15:26.84 --> 02:15:29.08
Like just like just simply state the facts.

2300
02:15:29.08 --> 02:15:30.64
Yeah, here's what I did.

2301
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:32.96
You know, right, we turned this project around.

2302
02:15:32.96 --> 02:15:34.80
We got it on track and on budget

2303
02:15:34.80 --> 02:15:36.000
and that's the type of,

2304
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.40
that's the type of experience that I have

2305
02:15:37.40 --> 02:15:38.40
in those situations.

2306
02:15:38.40 --> 02:15:40.08
Right, just like how you're saying,

2307
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:42.28
like even if someone had got like an award

2308
02:15:42.28 --> 02:15:45.44
to be the best whatever.

2309
02:15:45.44 --> 02:15:46.44
Sales are in the year.

2310
02:15:46.44 --> 02:15:47.48
That right, sales are in the year,

2311
02:15:47.48 --> 02:15:49.28
the best whatever of the year.

2312
02:15:49.28 --> 02:15:53.000
And then like to say that in a factual way would be,

2313
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.88
I was recognized as the best guy in the world.

2314
02:15:55.88 --> 02:15:57.60
Instead of saying, I'm the best guy in the world.

2315
02:15:57.60 --> 02:15:59.68
Here's my award to prove it.

2316
02:15:59.68 --> 02:16:00.76
You know, so it's like you're seeing the fact

2317
02:16:00.76 --> 02:16:02.000
that you were recognized.

2318
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

2319
02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.12
Not so much the fact.

2320
02:16:04.12 --> 02:16:06.84
That's a very good way of doing it.

2321
02:16:06.84 --> 02:16:07.84
Stick to the facts, right?

2322
02:16:07.84 --> 02:16:08.68
Just the facts.

2323
02:16:08.68 --> 02:16:11.68
Yeah, sure next question.

2324
02:16:11.68 --> 02:16:16.36
How do you stay humble when you know you have better

2325
02:16:16.36 --> 02:16:18.92
skill sets than others?

2326
02:16:18.92 --> 02:16:22.48
You seem humble with all that you've accomplished.

2327
02:16:22.48 --> 02:16:24.68
Well, this is just what, like in general,

2328
02:16:24.68 --> 02:16:27.88
just how do you stay humble when you know you have

2329
02:16:27.88 --> 02:16:29.96
better skill sets than others?

2330
02:16:29.96 --> 02:16:32.76
And then you say that I seem humble with all that

2331
02:16:32.76 --> 02:16:35.000
I've accomplished, which is actually,

2332
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.60
it's funny when I read that.

2333
02:16:38.60 --> 02:16:42.80
Like it's not, I'm sure that for the dude

2334
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:45.08
is asking this question, he's thinking I accomplished

2335
02:16:45.08 --> 02:16:47.04
all this stuff and it's not, I don't feel that way.

2336
02:16:47.04 --> 02:16:50.88
Like first of all, there's always somebody

2337
02:16:50.88 --> 02:16:52.08
that's better than you.

2338
02:16:52.08 --> 02:16:53.80
That's, that I guarantee it.

2339
02:16:53.80 --> 02:16:55.56
There's someone that's done more than you.

2340
02:16:55.56 --> 02:16:56.84
There's someone that's had better experience

2341
02:16:56.84 --> 02:16:58.96
or someone that's accomplished more.

2342
02:16:58.96 --> 02:17:03.96
And if you are truly the master of something,

2343
02:17:06.36 --> 02:17:10.24
whatever one thing, you're a true master of.

2344
02:17:10.24 --> 02:17:13.16
There's gonna be people that are a lot better

2345
02:17:13.16 --> 02:17:14.48
at other things than you.

2346
02:17:14.48 --> 02:17:18.60
So you might be the master of one particular thing,

2347
02:17:18.60 --> 02:17:21.48
but you have to respect the fact

2348
02:17:21.48 --> 02:17:25.80
that people are gonna be masters at other things

2349
02:17:25.80 --> 02:17:26.64
or better than you.

2350
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:29.56
And so if you're super strong, that's great.

2351
02:17:29.56 --> 02:17:30.72
Let's see you run a marathon.

2352
02:17:30.72 --> 02:17:33.84
If you're super flexible, awesome,

2353
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:35.04
how much can you dead left?

2354
02:17:35.04 --> 02:17:37.24
If you're smart, that's great.

2355
02:17:37.24 --> 02:17:38.92
You're smart academically.

2356
02:17:38.92 --> 02:17:40.48
Let's check out your common sense

2357
02:17:40.48 --> 02:17:41.72
and see where all that's at.

2358
02:17:41.72 --> 02:17:45.92
You know, so you're gonna be good at one thing,

2359
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:48.08
but you're gonna have failed in other areas

2360
02:17:48.08 --> 02:17:49.88
or have weaknesses in other areas.

2361
02:17:49.88 --> 02:17:54.36
And so you just have to keep that in check.

2362
02:17:54.36 --> 02:17:59.36
And I'll tell you, I recognize why I've been successful.

2363
02:18:03.60 --> 02:18:05.96
For one thing, been surrounded with great people,

2364
02:18:05.96 --> 02:18:08.32
for other being lucky in certain situations

2365
02:18:08.32 --> 02:18:09.88
that I've been in certain times,

2366
02:18:09.88 --> 02:18:12.76
and going back to the Jitsu a little bit.

2367
02:18:13.92 --> 02:18:18.92
It's a good example because just because I can beat someone

2368
02:18:18.92 --> 02:18:23.92
in Jitsu, it doesn't mean that I'm a better person.

2369
02:18:24.68 --> 02:18:26.32
Yeah, it does.

2370
02:18:26.32 --> 02:18:28.56
It doesn't mean that I'm a better person.

2371
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:33.56
What it means, basically, is that I happen to get

2372
02:18:33.92 --> 02:18:37.88
into this random fringe sport before they did.

2373
02:18:37.88 --> 02:18:39.56
And I spent more time on the map than they did.

2374
02:18:39.56 --> 02:18:40.44
That's what it means.

2375
02:18:40.44 --> 02:18:41.64
It doesn't make me better person.

2376
02:18:41.64 --> 02:18:43.96
And I'll tell you what, it goes with,

2377
02:18:43.96 --> 02:18:47.20
you know, if you feel like you're smarter than someone,

2378
02:18:47.20 --> 02:18:50.08
it's probably because you've had the opportunity

2379
02:18:50.08 --> 02:18:53.12
to study a subject or you've had a bunch of education

2380
02:18:53.12 --> 02:18:55.24
on something, you've dove into some subjects

2381
02:18:55.24 --> 02:18:57.20
so that might make you seem smarter.

2382
02:18:57.20 --> 02:18:59.52
Whereas if they applied themselves in that particular,

2383
02:18:59.52 --> 02:19:01.64
because what they were applying themselves is something else.

2384
02:19:01.64 --> 02:19:06.64
So yeah, stay, you gotta stay humble with that.

2385
02:19:07.16 --> 02:19:10.64
And also, we talked about this,

2386
02:19:10.64 --> 02:19:14.16
when you, oh, you don't, I am smarter than this person.

2387
02:19:14.16 --> 02:19:15.88
We'll guess what, there's something

2388
02:19:15.88 --> 02:19:17.72
that they're better than you.

2389
02:19:17.72 --> 02:19:18.72
And what is it?

2390
02:19:18.72 --> 02:19:20.36
You might be smarter than them, I guess what?

2391
02:19:20.36 --> 02:19:21.88
Maybe it's a guy we talked about earlier,

2392
02:19:21.88 --> 02:19:23.44
where I'm smarter as I could be,

2393
02:19:23.44 --> 02:19:25.28
guess what, this person can physically take me down

2394
02:19:25.28 --> 02:19:27.24
and dominate me, and that's horrible.

2395
02:19:27.24 --> 02:19:29.36
Or they're better at whatever, better athletically,

2396
02:19:29.36 --> 02:19:32.20
or some people are really good craftsmen with their hands.

2397
02:19:32.20 --> 02:19:33.64
I mean, there's so many different things

2398
02:19:33.64 --> 02:19:35.56
that you can be skilled at.

2399
02:19:35.56 --> 02:19:39.04
And if you start thinking that yourself

2400
02:19:39.04 --> 02:19:43.44
that you're better than other people,

2401
02:19:43.44 --> 02:19:46.28
you're gonna have issues because in the long run,

2402
02:19:47.32 --> 02:19:50.04
you wanna stay humble, just stay alive,

2403
02:19:50.04 --> 02:19:52.44
because life will humble you.

2404
02:19:52.44 --> 02:19:55.96
Life is hard, and if you're pushing hard,

2405
02:19:55.96 --> 02:19:59.04
and you're driving hard, and you're trying to achieve a lot,

2406
02:19:59.04 --> 02:20:00.60
you're not always gonna win.

2407
02:20:00.60 --> 02:20:02.16
I don't care who you are, you're gonna get humble.

2408
02:20:02.16 --> 02:20:03.96
It's gonna be hard.

2409
02:20:03.96 --> 02:20:06.20
So many, so many people that are successful,

2410
02:20:06.20 --> 02:20:09.04
they've got some hard luck stories along the way

2411
02:20:09.04 --> 02:20:10.88
of things that they had to push through

2412
02:20:10.88 --> 02:20:12.28
and overcome in order to get there.

2413
02:20:12.28 --> 02:20:13.68
They got humble.

2414
02:20:13.68 --> 02:20:18.28
And if you're winning every single time,

2415
02:20:18.28 --> 02:20:22.92
then you're not your goals or height enough.

2416
02:20:22.92 --> 02:20:24.08
So step those up.

2417
02:20:24.08 --> 02:20:28.28
So, you know, I appreciate the kind of comment,

2418
02:20:28.28 --> 02:20:31.40
but man, it's not hard to be humble.

2419
02:20:31.40 --> 02:20:34.44
When you just take, like maybe someone,

2420
02:20:34.44 --> 02:20:39.44
and people always think, oh, oh, he's a Navy seal, whatever.

2421
02:20:39.44 --> 02:20:43.68
You know, there's a lot of seals

2422
02:20:43.68 --> 02:20:45.80
that are more badass than me,

2423
02:20:45.80 --> 02:20:47.32
that done more deployments,

2424
02:20:47.32 --> 02:20:49.36
that have gotten after it more than me.

2425
02:20:49.36 --> 02:20:51.96
And I know that, that's awesome.

2426
02:20:51.96 --> 02:20:54.36
I mean, good, good for them.

2427
02:20:54.36 --> 02:20:58.36
You know, they got after it, good.

2428
02:20:59.28 --> 02:21:02.60
So I don't feel like, oh, I did more than everybody.

2429
02:21:02.60 --> 02:21:04.84
No, there's no one like that.

2430
02:21:04.84 --> 02:21:07.000
There's no one like that, even, you know,

2431
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.84
Mikey Thornton, who won't see all that

2432
02:21:08.84 --> 02:21:11.24
one of the metal varnish, awesome guy of,

2433
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:12.92
you know, just to just to, you know,

2434
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:16.04
he's a hero, but if you know,

2435
02:21:16.04 --> 02:21:16.80
he gets interviewed,

2436
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:18.56
if it's watched a bunch of interviewed here

2437
02:21:18.56 --> 02:21:20.84
and heard him talk, he's like, you know,

2438
02:21:20.84 --> 02:21:22.96
he's like, oh, you know, you got the metal varnish

2439
02:21:22.96 --> 02:21:23.96
that's not mine.

2440
02:21:23.96 --> 02:21:26.56
It's my guys, you know, it's a guy that I was with,

2441
02:21:26.56 --> 02:21:27.44
represents all.

2442
02:21:27.44 --> 02:21:30.80
So, there's a guy like who's gonna be,

2443
02:21:30.80 --> 02:21:32.60
if there's anyone in the world that needs to,

2444
02:21:32.60 --> 02:21:36.000
that could not be humble, maybe it's Mikey Thornton.

2445
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.92
But guess what, Mikey Thornton,

2446
02:21:37.92 --> 02:21:39.44
he's as humble as they come,

2447
02:21:39.44 --> 02:21:42.60
because you know what, he also has been humbled by combat,

2448
02:21:42.60 --> 02:21:44.88
because he realizes things that he tried to do

2449
02:21:44.88 --> 02:21:46.24
that he didn't get done.

2450
02:21:46.24 --> 02:21:48.80
There's lives he tried to save that he couldn't save.

2451
02:21:48.80 --> 02:21:51.36
So, you're gonna, there's no doubt

2452
02:21:51.36 --> 02:21:54.000
if you're living the right life,

2453
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.44
you're gonna be humbled by it.

2454
02:21:55.44 --> 02:21:58.80
And there's always, always, always gonna be somebody

2455
02:21:58.80 --> 02:22:02.20
that's better than you that's done by the way.

2456
02:22:02.20 --> 02:22:04.52
What does being cocky get you anyways?

2457
02:22:04.52 --> 02:22:05.96
What does that turn you into?

2458
02:22:05.96 --> 02:22:08.04
What, I talked about something,

2459
02:22:08.04 --> 02:22:10.80
what is over confidence gets you start cutting corners,

2460
02:22:10.80 --> 02:22:13.52
you start slack, I mean, it's just ridiculous.

2461
02:22:13.52 --> 02:22:16.32
So, you gotta stay humble, you gotta stay hungry

2462
02:22:16.32 --> 02:22:18.28
if you, if you wanna stay in the game

2463
02:22:18.28 --> 02:22:21.08
and believe me, you wanna stay in the game.

2464
02:22:21.08 --> 02:22:23.12
If you wanna stay in the game.

2465
02:22:23.12 --> 02:22:28.12
Did you think that, like, and I can't,

2466
02:22:28.12 --> 02:22:30.44
I mean, I don't know if, maybe this is where

2467
02:22:30.44 --> 02:22:33.76
this even the question is coming from, but,

2468
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:37.56
if, you know, when you're insecure and you're just,

2469
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:39.48
like, everything's a competition,

2470
02:22:39.48 --> 02:22:41.000
like, just in life, it's like,

2471
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.24
it goes beyond just what you're into.

2472
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:45.68
It's just like, if someone's better than me,

2473
02:22:45.68 --> 02:22:48.28
for it makes me mad, it makes you uneasy or whatever.

2474
02:22:48.28 --> 02:22:50.36
It's like this insecurity kind of thing.

2475
02:22:50.36 --> 02:22:53.72
So, if you look at everything, it's just this big life

2476
02:22:53.72 --> 02:22:55.28
compared, like, I gotta beat that guy,

2477
02:22:55.28 --> 02:22:56.36
I gotta be better than them.

2478
02:22:56.36 --> 02:22:58.32
So, when you are better than them,

2479
02:22:58.32 --> 02:23:00.64
it's like you're still looking at this competition,

2480
02:23:00.64 --> 02:23:03.24
like, you know, like, you're not on my level,

2481
02:23:03.24 --> 02:23:05.000
so you don't deserve to be treated.

2482
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000
It's kind of like, maybe this is a good analogy,

2483
02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.20
maybe not, but like in Gigietsu,

2484
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:12.12
where if you roll with a white belt, you don't go hard.

2485
02:23:12.12 --> 02:23:13.92
You don't get satisfaction or whatever.

2486
02:23:13.92 --> 02:23:16.76
So, in the Gigietsu competition arena,

2487
02:23:16.76 --> 02:23:18.52
you're not giving them the respect.

2488
02:23:18.52 --> 02:23:21.68
You're not going all out like you would,

2489
02:23:21.68 --> 02:23:24.12
you're not respecting his farm bar.

2490
02:23:24.12 --> 02:23:26.12
If you are, you're smashing him, no satisfaction,

2491
02:23:26.12 --> 02:23:26.96
you know, whatever.

2492
02:23:26.96 --> 02:23:29.68
It's in that specific competition setting.

2493
02:23:29.68 --> 02:23:31.000
But if you're just an insecure person,

2494
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.60
where you think that all life is like just one big competition,

2495
02:23:34.60 --> 02:23:35.80
oh, you gotta smash that person.

2496
02:23:35.80 --> 02:23:37.96
Yeah, and if you're not worthy of my smashing,

2497
02:23:37.96 --> 02:23:39.64
it's like, I don't even treat you,

2498
02:23:39.64 --> 02:23:42.44
like you should be on the mat with you in a single.

2499
02:23:42.44 --> 02:23:45.04
But, maybe I mean, do you think that maybe that's where

2500
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:46.28
some of that comes from?

2501
02:23:46.28 --> 02:23:50.72
Like, if you're having trouble, like, being humble,

2502
02:23:50.72 --> 02:23:52.40
it's kind of like, I'm just better than you in life.

2503
02:23:52.40 --> 02:23:53.48
Yeah, it's probably just kind of,

2504
02:23:53.48 --> 02:23:55.80
just to living from, in its insecurity.

2505
02:23:55.80 --> 02:23:58.64
But there's also a, there's a dichotomy there too,

2506
02:23:58.64 --> 02:24:01.40
because man, I like to win.

2507
02:24:01.40 --> 02:24:02.68
Like, like, no doubt about it.

2508
02:24:02.68 --> 02:24:04.28
I like to win.

2509
02:24:04.28 --> 02:24:05.96
And the dichotomy of it is,

2510
02:24:05.96 --> 02:24:09.92
is that I also don't literally don't care.

2511
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:12.48
Like, if I get beat, I'm like, okay, well,

2512
02:24:12.48 --> 02:24:13.96
what can I do to get better?

2513
02:24:13.96 --> 02:24:19.96
It's not, I don't feel this despair

2514
02:24:20.04 --> 02:24:23.24
because I lost losing actually kind of motivates me more.

2515
02:24:23.24 --> 02:24:24.56
Right, yeah.

2516
02:24:24.56 --> 02:24:28.48
As opposed to getting angry and the worst thing that happens

2517
02:24:28.48 --> 02:24:30.20
is people decide they're not going to compete, right?

2518
02:24:30.20 --> 02:24:32.56
They're not going to compete in the game of life

2519
02:24:32.56 --> 02:24:34.96
because they didn't win or they don't feel like they can win.

2520
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:37.68
So they go, ah, you know what, I'm just going to,

2521
02:24:37.68 --> 02:24:39.76
if I'm just going to back off, I'm just not going to participate

2522
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:40.60
in the game.

2523
02:24:40.60 --> 02:24:44.04
But getting the game, getting the game,

2524
02:24:44.04 --> 02:24:45.68
yeah, huh.

2525
02:24:45.68 --> 02:24:51.68
So maybe it comes from not understanding what that means

2526
02:24:51.68 --> 02:24:54.12
when you win and stuff.

2527
02:24:56.64 --> 02:24:57.48
I get, I guess.

2528
02:24:57.48 --> 02:24:59.000
You know, like, let's say like, like,

2529
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.96
the fight back to the fighting situation

2530
02:25:00.96 --> 02:25:03.28
where about, you know, being a secure part

2531
02:25:03.28 --> 02:25:05.44
of the male balancing and real psyche.

2532
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:08.04
If you know that you've achieved these skills,

2533
02:25:08.04 --> 02:25:10.56
have these skills to win people, you know,

2534
02:25:10.56 --> 02:25:12.20
who don't have your skill set,

2535
02:25:12.20 --> 02:25:14.16
you don't want to fight them.

2536
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:15.88
So you're just like whatever.

2537
02:25:15.88 --> 02:25:18.28
But let's say like, you have a better skill set.

2538
02:25:18.28 --> 02:25:21.52
Yet you're still blowing your horn about your skill set.

2539
02:25:21.52 --> 02:25:23.32
You're not humble about it.

2540
02:25:23.32 --> 02:25:25.56
It's like it comes from maybe, I don't know,

2541
02:25:25.56 --> 02:25:26.40
some of the things.

2542
02:25:26.40 --> 02:25:28.48
There's no doubt there can be some insecurity

2543
02:25:28.48 --> 02:25:34.48
that charges that makes people super competitive

2544
02:25:34.96 --> 02:25:37.80
beyond the healthy, compared to like in life.

2545
02:25:37.80 --> 02:25:41.08
Like I'm just in life, you know, no matter what,

2546
02:25:41.08 --> 02:25:43.56
which again, there's people that are that way,

2547
02:25:43.56 --> 02:25:45.12
myself included.

2548
02:25:45.12 --> 02:25:48.28
And but again, the dichotomy is,

2549
02:25:48.28 --> 02:25:49.16
I don't think you're like that.

2550
02:25:49.16 --> 02:25:51.72
No, no, I know I am.

2551
02:25:51.72 --> 02:25:53.36
Well, I know I am.

2552
02:25:53.36 --> 02:25:55.92
Remember echelon front, remember the logo?

2553
02:25:55.92 --> 02:25:57.08
Yeah, right.

2554
02:25:57.08 --> 02:25:59.88
And I'm gonna post this on Twitter too.

2555
02:25:59.88 --> 02:26:02.72
Jockel made the original echelon front logo.

2556
02:26:02.72 --> 02:26:03.64
This is like long time ago.

2557
02:26:03.64 --> 02:26:04.48
Yeah, yeah.

2558
02:26:04.48 --> 02:26:06.56
And you're like, hey, you know, this is the logo,

2559
02:26:06.56 --> 02:26:07.88
something like this.

2560
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:11.88
And then basically, but you didn't care that it was junk.

2561
02:26:11.88 --> 02:26:14.68
No, no, but I all I want to do is get you the idea.

2562
02:26:14.68 --> 02:26:16.12
You weren't competing with me.

2563
02:26:16.12 --> 02:26:18.000
But you drew an idol, but like it,

2564
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.88
like as someone who's competing in everything in life,

2565
02:26:19.88 --> 02:26:21.60
like if you draw something and I draw something,

2566
02:26:21.60 --> 02:26:23.000
you're like, I want to make my better.

2567
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:23.80
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2568
02:26:23.80 --> 02:26:27.24
But well, see, I wanted to win with the idea,

2569
02:26:27.24 --> 02:26:28.56
not with the skill, the idea.

2570
02:26:28.56 --> 02:26:29.40
The idea.

2571
02:26:29.40 --> 02:26:30.56
I wanted to win the war.

2572
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:34.04
Not the short-term battles like who can draw this thing better.

2573
02:26:34.04 --> 02:26:38.36
The war was who comes up with a strategic victory,

2574
02:26:38.36 --> 02:26:43.24
which the icon and the symbol for echelon front

2575
02:26:43.24 --> 02:26:45.56
is the one that I drew.

2576
02:26:45.56 --> 02:26:46.36
I liked it.

2577
02:26:46.36 --> 02:26:48.72
Ha ha.

2578
02:26:48.72 --> 02:26:49.64
Sir, yes.

2579
02:26:49.64 --> 02:26:51.36
I didn't care that it looked like junk,

2580
02:26:51.36 --> 02:26:53.76
because I was, did it with your hood post,

2581
02:26:53.76 --> 02:26:54.60
so that's pretty funny.

2582
02:26:54.60 --> 02:26:57.04
I did it on PowerPoint with like a crayon,

2583
02:26:57.04 --> 02:27:00.44
looks like a crayon, because I didn't want to take one time with it.

2584
02:27:00.44 --> 02:27:03.12
I know, I knew that that thing would take you 15 minutes

2585
02:27:03.12 --> 02:27:07.40
to make on your, what is it, AI, ill, illistory,

2586
02:27:07.40 --> 02:27:08.72
yeah, man, no, long time.

2587
02:27:08.72 --> 02:27:10.72
And I was like, that might have been,

2588
02:27:10.72 --> 02:27:12.48
don't be mad at me.

2589
02:27:12.48 --> 02:27:16.56
That's probably the first logo that I've actually made.

2590
02:27:16.56 --> 02:27:17.56
Maybe.

2591
02:27:17.56 --> 02:27:18.40
There you go.

2592
02:27:18.40 --> 02:27:19.40
It was very successful.

2593
02:27:19.40 --> 02:27:21.44
Yeah, whoo.

2594
02:27:21.44 --> 02:27:23.84
Thanks for trusting me.

2595
02:27:23.84 --> 02:27:25.04
Next question.

2596
02:27:25.04 --> 02:27:32.44
What do you do when you have two extreme ownership believers

2597
02:27:32.44 --> 02:27:35.28
that have to go against each other?

2598
02:27:35.28 --> 02:27:36.28
Ooh.

2599
02:27:36.28 --> 02:27:40.12
Sounds like a big challenging question,

2600
02:27:40.12 --> 02:27:43.32
but it actually shouldn't be because if you think about this,

2601
02:27:43.32 --> 02:27:44.72
if you truly think about this,

2602
02:27:44.72 --> 02:27:47.92
this should not be an issue, and here's why,

2603
02:27:47.92 --> 02:27:51.68
we go against each other, against each other.

2604
02:27:51.68 --> 02:27:53.56
So what are the goals?

2605
02:27:53.56 --> 02:27:55.48
Are these two people on the same team?

2606
02:27:55.48 --> 02:27:57.40
I'm assuming that they're on the same team, right?

2607
02:27:57.40 --> 02:27:58.68
They're on the same team.

2608
02:27:58.68 --> 02:28:01.60
So if they're on the same team, and we want to win,

2609
02:28:02.80 --> 02:28:05.08
we have the same goals we want to win,

2610
02:28:05.08 --> 02:28:06.64
but we won't work together.

2611
02:28:07.52 --> 02:28:09.76
Because if the goal is to win,

2612
02:28:09.76 --> 02:28:12.16
and we both want to win,

2613
02:28:12.16 --> 02:28:15.64
why would we be going against each other?

2614
02:28:15.64 --> 02:28:19.36
We are not taking actual extreme ownership.

2615
02:28:19.36 --> 02:28:21.32
Because if you and I were had opposing ideas,

2616
02:28:21.32 --> 02:28:23.12
but we had the same long term goal,

2617
02:28:23.12 --> 02:28:24.12
I'm going to take ownership and say,

2618
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:25.72
all right, Echo, we got to come to terms here,

2619
02:28:25.72 --> 02:28:27.16
we're going to work this out, we're going to figure it out.

2620
02:28:27.16 --> 02:28:28.04
And if you were doing the same thing,

2621
02:28:28.04 --> 02:28:29.04
you'd be like, yeah, absolutely.

2622
02:28:29.04 --> 02:28:30.24
Let's sit down, let's figure this out,

2623
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:31.44
let's figure out which one would be the best ones to take

2624
02:28:31.44 --> 02:28:32.88
to market, let's do it to market system.

2625
02:28:32.88 --> 02:28:34.76
We're going to figure out a real solution,

2626
02:28:34.76 --> 02:28:36.28
because we're taking ownership of it.

2627
02:28:36.28 --> 02:28:39.92
So what's the little nugget that's getting into the system here

2628
02:28:39.92 --> 02:28:43.12
in screwing things up into 80 to ego, 100%.

2629
02:28:43.12 --> 02:28:45.52
And I will say this.

2630
02:28:45.52 --> 02:28:50.52
Occasionally, the ideal extreme ownership can be very poorly

2631
02:28:51.96 --> 02:28:55.48
and very incorrectly interpreted as micro management

2632
02:28:55.48 --> 02:28:56.56
in ego media.

2633
02:28:56.56 --> 02:29:01.56
Meaning, I'm going to own this, I own this, this is mine, right?

2634
02:29:01.72 --> 02:29:05.84
We're not, that's not what extreme ownership is at all.

2635
02:29:05.84 --> 02:29:08.80
It's, you've got to own everything,

2636
02:29:08.80 --> 02:29:13.80
but you don't feel the intrinsic need to do everything, right?

2637
02:29:17.68 --> 02:29:22.20
Because you own, it's like owning the outcome

2638
02:29:22.20 --> 02:29:27.20
and owning the progress and owning the steps along the way

2639
02:29:27.80 --> 02:29:30.68
and owning the responsibility of mission achievement,

2640
02:29:30.68 --> 02:29:34.60
it doesn't mean that you own each individual step

2641
02:29:34.60 --> 02:29:36.72
and you have to make it your way.

2642
02:29:36.72 --> 02:29:39.64
That's not extreme ownership, that's micro management.

2643
02:29:40.92 --> 02:29:45.92
But, you know, extreme ownership is about leadership

2644
02:29:45.92 --> 02:29:48.96
and decentralized command

2645
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:51.88
that using indirect tactics to make things happen

2646
02:29:51.88 --> 02:29:54.48
and owning the outcome.

2647
02:29:54.48 --> 02:29:57.76
So that's why, when you have two people

2648
02:29:57.76 --> 02:30:02.44
that were truly about like, hey, I'm going to own this.

2649
02:30:02.44 --> 02:30:04.48
I'm going to have the attitude to extreme ownership

2650
02:30:04.48 --> 02:30:07.24
if you and I have the attitude to extreme ownership,

2651
02:30:07.24 --> 02:30:08.88
we're not going to fight over anything

2652
02:30:08.88 --> 02:30:11.80
because we have the same long term goal.

2653
02:30:11.80 --> 02:30:14.88
And if you come up with a better idea of how to get there,

2654
02:30:14.88 --> 02:30:18.72
I'm going to say, oh, echo, awesome job.

2655
02:30:18.72 --> 02:30:21.84
That's a great way we're going to get to where we want to go.

2656
02:30:21.84 --> 02:30:24.32
We own that outcome, we're going to make it happen.

2657
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:26.12
Boom, I'm going to support you.

2658
02:30:26.12 --> 02:30:28.04
The only time it's going to be a problem

2659
02:30:28.04 --> 02:30:31.16
is if I have an ego and then you have an ego.

2660
02:30:31.16 --> 02:30:34.36
When we both have an ego issue,

2661
02:30:34.36 --> 02:30:38.16
and usually one person with a big ego,

2662
02:30:39.24 --> 02:30:43.20
that that inflames other people's use.

2663
02:30:43.20 --> 02:30:45.12
Because if I say, hey, echo,

2664
02:30:45.12 --> 02:30:46.64
I got a great plan for how to do this.

2665
02:30:46.64 --> 02:30:48.76
We need to execute it my way.

2666
02:30:48.76 --> 02:30:50.84
There's a little bit of ego coming out of this.

2667
02:30:50.84 --> 02:30:53.000
Because now your ego was down,

2668
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:53.84
but I wasn't even ready.

2669
02:30:53.84 --> 02:30:55.32
What do you mean your way?

2670
02:30:55.32 --> 02:30:57.44
Wait a second, just right there, now we got a thing.

2671
02:30:57.44 --> 02:30:59.32
Now we got some cop kind of issue going.

2672
02:30:59.32 --> 02:31:02.52
We're now we're working against each other

2673
02:31:02.52 --> 02:31:03.80
instead of working together.

2674
02:31:03.80 --> 02:31:08.68
So that is absolutely problematic.

2675
02:31:08.68 --> 02:31:11.84
And I guess to say, to put this in a nutshell,

2676
02:31:11.84 --> 02:31:15.28
the way if you're using the principle

2677
02:31:15.28 --> 02:31:18.84
of extreme ownership, the most important thing

2678
02:31:18.84 --> 02:31:23.12
you need to take extreme ownership of is your own ego.

2679
02:31:23.12 --> 02:31:25.48
And put that thing in check.

2680
02:31:26.68 --> 02:31:30.20
Yeah, it seems like the extreme ownership,

2681
02:31:30.20 --> 02:31:32.72
as far as owning it is essentially

2682
02:31:32.72 --> 02:31:35.40
taking responsibility like at all costs kind of thing

2683
02:31:35.40 --> 02:31:38.20
for more like the bad stuff that happens.

2684
02:31:38.20 --> 02:31:39.76
Oh absolutely bad stuff.

2685
02:31:39.76 --> 02:31:40.60
Absolutely bad stuff.

2686
02:31:40.60 --> 02:31:43.92
But you know, but you're going to take because absolutely,

2687
02:31:43.92 --> 02:31:46.76
if you and I do something great together

2688
02:31:46.76 --> 02:31:49.76
and I was the leader, I don't go, yes, that's right.

2689
02:31:49.76 --> 02:31:53.60
I was the, you know, you say, hey, first of all,

2690
02:31:53.60 --> 02:31:54.72
this is mostly on echo.

2691
02:31:54.72 --> 02:31:55.72
He did most of the work.

2692
02:31:55.72 --> 02:31:57.36
He did all the, you know, that's what I'm going to say.

2693
02:31:57.36 --> 02:31:59.16
I'm not going to say, no, this is mine.

2694
02:31:59.16 --> 02:32:01.36
But when something goes wrong, obviously,

2695
02:32:01.36 --> 02:32:02.84
I don't say no, is that a goes fault?

2696
02:32:02.84 --> 02:32:05.04
No, I say, hey, this is my fault.

2697
02:32:05.04 --> 02:32:07.36
So you know, I should have done double check on the audio

2698
02:32:07.36 --> 02:32:09.80
before we started the podcast because, you know,

2699
02:32:09.80 --> 02:32:12.56
we wanted to make sure that thing was recording.

2700
02:32:12.56 --> 02:32:13.40
Right.

2701
02:32:13.40 --> 02:32:15.76
I don't say no echo drop the ball.

2702
02:32:15.76 --> 02:32:16.60
Yeah, I don't do that.

2703
02:32:16.60 --> 02:32:17.44
I don't have.

2704
02:32:17.44 --> 02:32:18.92
I say, hey, you should have double checked.

2705
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:22.16
So that's if you truly have two people

2706
02:32:22.16 --> 02:32:25.84
that have real ownership and they put the re-goes in check,

2707
02:32:25.84 --> 02:32:27.96
this is literally not an issue.

2708
02:32:27.96 --> 02:32:28.80
Right.

2709
02:32:28.80 --> 02:32:30.52
So they, yeah, this isn't even a question for that right,

2710
02:32:30.52 --> 02:32:32.04
because they don't go against each other.

2711
02:32:32.04 --> 02:32:33.12
No, they're going with each other.

2712
02:32:33.12 --> 02:32:37.28
And so what are the chances that you, as a person,

2713
02:32:37.28 --> 02:32:38.92
that's really put your ego in check

2714
02:32:38.92 --> 02:32:40.76
and you're exercising your ownership?

2715
02:32:40.76 --> 02:32:44.40
What are the chances that you work

2716
02:32:44.40 --> 02:32:46.76
with another person that is exactly

2717
02:32:47.92 --> 02:32:50.28
with the same mindset taking ownership?

2718
02:32:50.28 --> 02:32:51.36
But no ego.

2719
02:32:51.36 --> 02:32:53.76
What are the chances that they're actually pretty slim?

2720
02:32:53.76 --> 02:32:54.84
This is not easy to do.

2721
02:32:54.84 --> 02:32:57.000
This, it's simple, not easy, right?

2722
02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.000
So that means you have to be even more proactive

2723
02:33:02.20 --> 02:33:07.04
in helping adapt to their ego scenario that's happening

2724
02:33:07.04 --> 02:33:09.48
and when echo says, hey, we need to do this my way.

2725
02:33:09.48 --> 02:33:10.96
I'll be like, hey, you know what echo?

2726
02:33:10.96 --> 02:33:11.72
Let's take a look at it.

2727
02:33:11.72 --> 02:33:13.56
Absolutely, you've always come up with great plans.

2728
02:33:13.56 --> 02:33:15.64
Let's take a look at what this one is here.

2729
02:33:15.64 --> 02:33:18.000
And all of a sudden, I've disarmed you a little bit.

2730
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.64
You're feeling good about it, you're like,

2731
02:33:19.64 --> 02:33:20.48
oh yeah, that's right.

2732
02:33:20.48 --> 02:33:22.80
Jock was gonna listen to me, because that's great.

2733
02:33:22.80 --> 02:33:24.28
That's exactly what I want you to think.

2734
02:33:24.28 --> 02:33:26.12
It's exactly what I want you to think.

2735
02:33:26.12 --> 02:33:28.56
So you're gonna have work to do.

2736
02:33:28.56 --> 02:33:29.80
You're gonna have work to do.

2737
02:33:29.80 --> 02:33:32.76
That's what that's what, that's what it is.

2738
02:33:32.76 --> 02:33:34.04
It's a challenge, it's work.

2739
02:33:34.04 --> 02:33:36.60
But when you have the basic principles,

2740
02:33:36.60 --> 02:33:37.68
the nation say basically,

2741
02:33:37.68 --> 02:33:39.92
you have the fundamental principles,

2742
02:33:39.92 --> 02:33:42.04
they are going to work well for you.

2743
02:33:42.04 --> 02:33:44.56
And when they're not working well for you,

2744
02:33:44.56 --> 02:33:46.64
don't get mad at the other person and blame

2745
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:48.68
there you go, look at your own ego,

2746
02:33:48.68 --> 02:33:52.000
because you can adjust an adapt and maneuver

2747
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.56
and get that person disarmed.

2748
02:33:54.56 --> 02:33:57.32
And you can flank them and then you're gonna win.

2749
02:33:57.32 --> 02:34:00.36
That's so interesting that how this question is like that.

2750
02:34:00.36 --> 02:34:03.04
Like it seems like when I first read it,

2751
02:34:03.04 --> 02:34:05.16
I was like, oh shoot, that's a good question, you know?

2752
02:34:05.16 --> 02:34:08.28
When there, and it is, but in a different way,

2753
02:34:08.28 --> 02:34:10.20
because this question is essentially what it does

2754
02:34:10.20 --> 02:34:12.76
is it like what he call it, like a strainer or whatever.

2755
02:34:12.76 --> 02:34:16.88
Like it shifts, it shifts, it strains out the guy

2756
02:34:16.88 --> 02:34:18.68
who's not doing extreme ownership.

2757
02:34:18.68 --> 02:34:21.32
See how it says if they're both exercising it?

2758
02:34:21.32 --> 02:34:22.44
But if they're going against each other,

2759
02:34:22.44 --> 02:34:23.84
that means there's some extreme ownership,

2760
02:34:23.84 --> 02:34:25.16
not being practiced somewhere in here.

2761
02:34:25.16 --> 02:34:28.40
We just know, but we're gonna, we can find out, you know?

2762
02:34:28.40 --> 02:34:29.68
Who's going against who kind of thing?

2763
02:34:29.68 --> 02:34:31.04
If they're both going against each other,

2764
02:34:31.04 --> 02:34:33.28
well, maybe they both have it, you know?

2765
02:34:33.28 --> 02:34:34.88
But there's always gonna be one person.

2766
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:38.000
You will not always, but there's using me one person

2767
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.40
that is got it.

2768
02:34:41.40 --> 02:34:42.64
Good that understands it.

2769
02:34:42.64 --> 02:34:44.16
And that's gonna be working in this guy.

2770
02:34:44.16 --> 02:34:48.000
It's just so good and so smooth and so tactical.

2771
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:48.96
And they're gonna win.

2772
02:34:48.96 --> 02:34:51.88
And that other person, that's right, you know,

2773
02:34:51.88 --> 02:34:54.48
I were winning because I got extreme ownership going on.

2774
02:34:54.48 --> 02:34:56.08
And I took ownership of this project.

2775
02:34:56.08 --> 02:34:56.96
And you know what the guy says?

2776
02:34:56.96 --> 02:35:00.84
Like the real, the real leader is like absolutely man.

2777
02:35:00.84 --> 02:35:02.16
You did a great job with that.

2778
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:04.88
And meanwhile he knows he just made his manipulated

2779
02:35:04.88 --> 02:35:06.88
and flanked him and made it happen

2780
02:35:06.88 --> 02:35:09.80
to the best of the team.

2781
02:35:09.80 --> 02:35:11.64
You know, he's keeping the train going.

2782
02:35:11.64 --> 02:35:12.48
That's good.

2783
02:35:12.48 --> 02:35:13.96
Yeah, he did.

2784
02:35:13.96 --> 02:35:15.24
It's just a thing.

2785
02:35:15.24 --> 02:35:16.08
Okay.

2786
02:35:16.08 --> 02:35:17.08
I think we got last question.

2787
02:35:17.08 --> 02:35:19.04
Yeah, just maybe one more.

2788
02:35:19.04 --> 02:35:19.88
Maybe.

2789
02:35:19.88 --> 02:35:22.64
Uh, talk a little.

2790
02:35:22.64 --> 02:35:24.96
Can you talk about fear of failure

2791
02:35:24.96 --> 02:35:26.20
and how to overcome it?

2792
02:35:28.16 --> 02:35:29.64
Fear of failure.

2793
02:35:31.68 --> 02:35:35.32
So obviously, fear of failure

2794
02:35:35.32 --> 02:35:38.68
can can keep you from taking risk.

2795
02:35:38.68 --> 02:35:41.48
And then it can leave you to sit in there

2796
02:35:41.48 --> 02:35:45.92
paralyzed into not taking any action at all.

2797
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:50.88
And then obviously, that's bad.

2798
02:35:50.88 --> 02:35:55.88
But I don't actually want you to overcome

2799
02:35:58.20 --> 02:36:00.04
the fear of failure.

2800
02:36:00.04 --> 02:36:05.08
I want you to be afraid of failure.

2801
02:36:05.08 --> 02:36:07.32
Fear of failure is good.

2802
02:36:07.32 --> 02:36:11.52
Fear of failure will keep you up at night,

2803
02:36:11.52 --> 02:36:17.12
planning and rehearsing and going over contingencies.

2804
02:36:17.12 --> 02:36:21.84
Fear of failure will keep you training hard.

2805
02:36:23.12 --> 02:36:27.56
It'll stop you from cutting corners.

2806
02:36:28.76 --> 02:36:33.92
Fear of failure will keep you working and thinking

2807
02:36:33.92 --> 02:36:39.000
and striving and relentlessly trying to be more prepared

2808
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000
for battle.

2809
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.64
So I want you to be afraid of failing.

2810
02:36:47.64 --> 02:36:49.84
I fear failure.

2811
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
But more important.

2812
02:36:55.28 --> 02:36:58.84
I want you to be horrified.

2813
02:36:58.84 --> 02:37:03.32
I want you to be terrified of sitting on your ass

2814
02:37:03.32 --> 02:37:06.04
and doing nothing.

2815
02:37:06.04 --> 02:37:07.92
That is what I want you to be afraid of.

2816
02:37:07.92 --> 02:37:12.76
Of waking up in six days or six weeks or six years

2817
02:37:12.76 --> 02:37:15.16
or 60 years.

2818
02:37:15.16 --> 02:37:18.16
And being no closer to your goal,

2819
02:37:18.16 --> 02:37:21.16
you've made no progress.

2820
02:37:22.80 --> 02:37:25.08
That is the horror.

2821
02:37:25.08 --> 02:37:28.04
That is the nightmare.

2822
02:37:29.04 --> 02:37:33.68
That is what you need to be truly afraid of.

2823
02:37:33.68 --> 02:37:37.68
Being stagnant.

2824
02:37:40.68 --> 02:37:46.68
So get up and go.

2825
02:37:47.68 --> 02:37:54.68
Take the risk, take the gamble, take the first step, take action.

2826
02:37:54.68 --> 02:38:03.68
And don't let another day slip by.

2827
02:38:07.68 --> 02:38:12.68
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

2828
02:38:12.68 --> 02:38:15.68
And if you got something out of the podcast tonight,

2829
02:38:15.68 --> 02:38:18.68
you want to hear some more.

2830
02:38:18.68 --> 02:38:21.68
Well, then maybe you should go ahead and support the podcast.

2831
02:38:21.68 --> 02:38:26.68
So how can the troopers out there best support the podcast?

2832
02:38:26.68 --> 02:38:31.68
Well, one of the or the initial way is to support yourself at the same time.

2833
02:38:31.68 --> 02:38:36.68
And that is to supplement on it.

2834
02:38:36.68 --> 02:38:39.68
On it has the best supplements.

2835
02:38:39.68 --> 02:38:42.68
You know, it's one thing to say they have the best supplements

2836
02:38:42.68 --> 02:38:43.68
because I like them.

2837
02:38:43.68 --> 02:38:46.68
But they have for real the best supplements.

2838
02:38:46.68 --> 02:38:48.68
Like the legit, you read all the stuff about it.

2839
02:38:48.68 --> 02:38:50.68
It's straight up the best.

2840
02:38:50.68 --> 02:38:51.68
You want 10% off there.

2841
02:38:51.68 --> 02:38:53.68
So support your wallet as well.

2842
02:38:53.68 --> 02:38:56.68
So you're supporting podcasts yourself and your wallet.

2843
02:38:56.68 --> 02:38:58.68
10% off on it.

2844
02:38:58.68 --> 02:38:59.68
That comes.

2845
02:38:59.68 --> 02:39:00.68
Yeah.

2846
02:39:00.68 --> 02:39:02.68
Sorry.

2847
02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:06.68
Also, if you want to passively support, you can do the Amazon click through that's

2848
02:39:06.68 --> 02:39:07.68
you're going to one of the websites.

2849
02:39:07.68 --> 02:39:11.68
Drop podcast.com or or the jocle store is the Amazon link on the top.

2850
02:39:11.68 --> 02:39:13.68
Now we have international.

2851
02:39:13.68 --> 02:39:17.68
Because everyone's like, who oversees or you know,

2852
02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:20.68
I'm going to ask me, hey, what about this? It's a it's a long story.

2853
02:39:20.68 --> 02:39:22.68
But it's not everywhere overseas.

2854
02:39:22.68 --> 02:39:23.68
It's Canada.

2855
02:39:23.68 --> 02:39:25.68
The being linked.

2856
02:39:25.68 --> 02:39:28.68
I started the ones that people have actually.

2857
02:39:28.68 --> 02:39:29.68
Okay, hold me.

2858
02:39:29.68 --> 02:39:31.68
You know, like, hey, we're here in the UK.

2859
02:39:31.68 --> 02:39:33.68
We want to, you know, be down with the thing or whatever.

2860
02:39:33.68 --> 02:39:35.68
And yeah, so I did those.

2861
02:39:35.68 --> 02:39:38.68
And so those are up on both websites as well.

2862
02:39:38.68 --> 02:39:40.68
Thanks for hitting me up with that.

2863
02:39:40.68 --> 02:39:42.68
By the way, um,

2864
02:39:42.68 --> 02:39:43.68
Overseas support.

2865
02:39:43.68 --> 02:39:44.68
Yeah.

2866
02:39:44.68 --> 02:39:44.68
Yes.

2867
02:39:44.68 --> 02:39:45.68
Fully.

2868
02:39:45.68 --> 02:39:46.68
So dope.

2869
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:50.68
And also, it's been Amazon the the new trooper tool.

2870
02:39:50.68 --> 02:39:53.68
That's a, that's pretty, it's a cool little tool.

2871
02:39:53.68 --> 02:39:55.68
Thanks again, Brady for that one.

2872
02:39:55.68 --> 02:39:57.68
IT genius.

2873
02:39:57.68 --> 02:39:59.68
And you did the student by the way.

2874
02:39:59.68 --> 02:40:00.68
Boy.

2875
02:40:00.68 --> 02:40:03.68
Um, nonetheless, like this tool, you just click it.

2876
02:40:03.68 --> 02:40:06.68
You got this a link to it on things called the, called the true

2877
02:40:06.68 --> 02:40:08.68
Jocfac has trooper tool.

2878
02:40:08.68 --> 02:40:09.68
Chrome extension.

2879
02:40:09.68 --> 02:40:10.68
So it's called awesome.

2880
02:40:10.68 --> 02:40:11.68
You click on the thing.

2881
02:40:11.68 --> 02:40:13.68
You just, like, you clean thing.

2882
02:40:13.68 --> 02:40:15.68
If you want to you click on the thing and it shows up.

2883
02:40:15.68 --> 02:40:16.68
You can't just click on the icon.

2884
02:40:16.68 --> 02:40:17.68
Joc was head.

2885
02:40:17.68 --> 02:40:20.68
And you can even hide that if you don't want it on your browser, whatever.

2886
02:40:20.68 --> 02:40:22.68
You just hide it if you don't want it there.

2887
02:40:22.68 --> 02:40:24.68
But it looks like I think it's kind of cool to up there, whatever.

2888
02:40:24.68 --> 02:40:27.68
Anyway, it helps you go to, it makes you go to Amazon.

2889
02:40:27.68 --> 02:40:29.68
It helps it go through the affiliate link.

2890
02:40:29.68 --> 02:40:31.68
So you don't have to go through the website anymore.

2891
02:40:31.68 --> 02:40:32.68
Does automatically for you.

2892
02:40:32.68 --> 02:40:34.68
So I think, say, say some time.

2893
02:40:34.68 --> 02:40:35.68
Right.

2894
02:40:35.68 --> 02:40:36.68
You know.

2895
02:40:36.68 --> 02:40:41.68
Also, you know, let's course subscribe to the iTunes and you too.

2896
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:43.68
I think we're going to pump some more value in YouTube.

2897
02:40:43.68 --> 02:40:45.68
But some outtakes on there, I think.

2898
02:40:45.68 --> 02:40:46.68
I like that.

2899
02:40:46.68 --> 02:40:47.68
I like where you're coming from.

2900
02:40:47.68 --> 02:40:48.68
Yeah.

2901
02:40:48.68 --> 02:40:50.68
Subscribe to the YouTube channel.

2902
02:40:50.68 --> 02:40:51.68
That'll be cool.

2903
02:40:51.68 --> 02:40:55.68
So we know that you're out there and you're going to receive these things that

2904
02:40:55.68 --> 02:40:57.68
Echoes put together.

2905
02:40:57.68 --> 02:40:58.68
Yeah.

2906
02:40:58.68 --> 02:41:01.68
And then also the, the Jockel Podcast Store.

2907
02:41:01.68 --> 02:41:02.68
Yeah.

2908
02:41:02.68 --> 02:41:06.68
If you like shirt, if you wear shirt, it was a Jockel Store.

2909
02:41:06.68 --> 02:41:07.68
JockelStore.com.

2910
02:41:07.68 --> 02:41:08.68
JockelStore.com.

2911
02:41:08.68 --> 02:41:09.68
You know.

2912
02:41:09.68 --> 02:41:10.68
It's cool T-shirts.

2913
02:41:10.68 --> 02:41:12.68
I think I still have yet to see one.

2914
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:14.68
In the wild.

2915
02:41:14.68 --> 02:41:16.68
Not someone I know.

2916
02:41:16.68 --> 02:41:20.68
So I'm looking forward to seeing that somewhere in the world.

2917
02:41:20.68 --> 02:41:22.68
Somewhere on planet earth.

2918
02:41:22.68 --> 02:41:26.68
I am thoroughly enjoying the pictures that people sent.

2919
02:41:26.68 --> 02:41:27.68
Yeah.

2920
02:41:27.68 --> 02:41:28.68
They're awesome.

2921
02:41:28.68 --> 02:41:29.68
You know what's funny?

2922
02:41:29.68 --> 02:41:31.68
The, the, the, the, the Heather Gray, right?

2923
02:41:31.68 --> 02:41:31.68
Yeah.

2924
02:41:31.68 --> 02:41:32.68
The, the gray.

2925
02:41:32.68 --> 02:41:34.68
So like that's the kind of shirt, like, you know,

2926
02:41:34.68 --> 02:41:35.68
a lot of lighter color shirt.

2927
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:38.68
They get real, um, like dark if you sweat in on that.

2928
02:41:38.68 --> 02:41:39.68
Right.

2929
02:41:39.68 --> 02:41:39.68
Right.

2930
02:41:39.68 --> 02:41:40.68
So they'll be like pictures.

2931
02:41:40.68 --> 02:41:42.68
I don't even know why I think this funny what it's interesting.

2932
02:41:42.68 --> 02:41:44.68
Because the other one is charcoal gray.

2933
02:41:44.68 --> 02:41:45.68
That's a dark gray.

2934
02:41:45.68 --> 02:41:46.68
So they'll be like, yeah, I got my disability.

2935
02:41:46.68 --> 02:41:48.68
And I see the bottom, like, looks like a stripe.

2936
02:41:48.68 --> 02:41:49.68
I'm like, wait, what?

2937
02:41:49.68 --> 02:41:50.68
That's weird.

2938
02:41:50.68 --> 02:41:51.68
How the lighting is.

2939
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:52.68
There's a stripe on the bottom.

2940
02:41:52.68 --> 02:41:53.68
You're shirt.

2941
02:41:53.68 --> 02:41:54.68
But it's not the charcoal gray one.

2942
02:41:54.68 --> 02:41:56.68
It's, you know, they're, they're getting after.

2943
02:41:56.68 --> 02:41:58.68
It's in the kitchen of getting after.

2944
02:41:58.68 --> 02:41:59.68
Yes, very much.

2945
02:41:59.68 --> 02:42:01.68
So anyway, I don't know why I thought those.

2946
02:42:01.68 --> 02:42:03.68
But it's, it looks funny.

2947
02:42:03.68 --> 02:42:04.68
Not funny.

2948
02:42:04.68 --> 02:42:05.68
Like I'm laughing at them.

2949
02:42:05.68 --> 02:42:06.68
But it's interesting.

2950
02:42:06.68 --> 02:42:07.68
It looks like a shirt.

2951
02:42:07.68 --> 02:42:08.68
It's like optical illusion.

2952
02:42:08.68 --> 02:42:09.68
Anyway.

2953
02:42:09.68 --> 02:42:10.68
So I'll start a comment.

2954
02:42:10.68 --> 02:42:11.68
There's some other shirts on there.

2955
02:42:11.68 --> 02:42:14.68
If you like them, coffee mugs and stickers.

2956
02:42:14.68 --> 02:42:15.68
Awesome.

2957
02:42:15.68 --> 02:42:16.68
Fumper stick.

2958
02:42:16.68 --> 02:42:22.68
Also, if you like the podcast and you want more of this information,

2959
02:42:22.68 --> 02:42:24.68
there's a book that I wrote with my brother,

2960
02:42:24.68 --> 02:42:25.68
Dave Babin.

2961
02:42:25.68 --> 02:42:26.68
It's called Extreme Ownership.

2962
02:42:26.68 --> 02:42:29.68
You can order it through Amazon.

2963
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:32.68
Or you can get any more books or sold.

2964
02:42:32.68 --> 02:42:35.68
It's available in hardcovered digital and audio format.

2965
02:42:35.68 --> 02:42:37.68
And the audio format, Dave, and I actually read.

2966
02:42:37.68 --> 02:42:38.68
So get some of that.

2967
02:42:38.68 --> 02:42:48.68
If you want to talk to Echo and I, you can find us on the interwebs at Twitter.

2968
02:42:48.68 --> 02:42:51.68
Echo is at Echo Charles.

2969
02:42:51.68 --> 02:42:53.68
And I am at Jockel Willink.

2970
02:42:53.68 --> 02:42:55.68
We're also on the Facebookie.

2971
02:42:55.68 --> 02:42:58.68
And some of that Instagram.

2972
02:42:58.68 --> 02:43:01.68
I got a snapchat thing.

2973
02:43:01.68 --> 02:43:03.68
I signed up for it or whatever.

2974
02:43:03.68 --> 02:43:05.68
But I haven't done anything with it yet.

2975
02:43:05.68 --> 02:43:06.68
Yeah.

2976
02:43:06.68 --> 02:43:08.68
I got to explore that.

2977
02:43:08.68 --> 02:43:12.68
But man, the social media stuff takes some time.

2978
02:43:12.68 --> 02:43:16.68
And I can't, if you want me, find me on Twitter.

2979
02:43:16.68 --> 02:43:17.68
That's the best way.

2980
02:43:17.68 --> 02:43:20.68
Ask your questions on Twitter, hit me up on Twitter.

2981
02:43:20.68 --> 02:43:24.68
That's the most common thing that I use.

2982
02:43:24.68 --> 02:43:26.68
I do check Facebook.

2983
02:43:26.68 --> 02:43:29.68
I mean, everything that has ever been sent to me, I've read.

2984
02:43:29.68 --> 02:43:32.68
I might not have responded to it because I can't literally

2985
02:43:32.68 --> 02:43:38.68
can't respond to every single thing that gets sent to me, which is what's nice about on Twitter.

2986
02:43:38.68 --> 02:43:40.68
I can just hit that I like it.

2987
02:43:40.68 --> 02:43:43.68
You know, so that people know like, oh, he read it cool on Facebook.

2988
02:43:43.68 --> 02:43:47.68
I read it, but there's nothing to press to say I read your thing.

2989
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:50.68
So maybe I should figure something out like that.

2990
02:43:50.68 --> 02:43:52.68
But anyways, you're, you're,

2991
02:43:52.68 --> 02:43:55.68
You're, you're, you're, you're, like, you get back to people and stuff, which is cool.

2992
02:43:55.68 --> 02:43:57.68
Because there's some people you can tell.

2993
02:43:57.68 --> 02:43:58.68
It's not that.

2994
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:00.68
It's like they're social media.

2995
02:44:00.68 --> 02:44:05.68
Yeah, it's me and I was just out where, where I just was, there was very limited internet.

2996
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:10.68
So I was able to get like a tweet out in the morning, a couple of tweets out in the morning.

2997
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:17.68
But when I'd go to start responding, it was, you know, three minutes to get to, to look at the tweet for somebody.

2998
02:44:17.68 --> 02:44:21.68
So I'm backed up right now for like five days, four days behind or something like that.

2999
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:22.68
Five days behind actually.

3000
02:44:22.68 --> 02:44:25.68
Yeah, but see, you mean to say that like that you're like backed up.

3001
02:44:25.68 --> 02:44:28.68
It means like, that you're, you know, you're engagement.

3002
02:44:28.68 --> 02:44:29.68
That's good.

3003
02:44:29.68 --> 02:44:34.68
Yeah, but even then I was reading and I do, man, if you send me something on Twitter,

3004
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:36.68
I'm going to see, you know, read it.

3005
02:44:36.68 --> 02:44:40.68
I might not respond to it directly, but I might, but I've had a day.

3006
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:45.68
Actually more than one, too, but I remember in a very specific time, a day where I wasn't going to go to jiu-jitsu.

3007
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:46.68
I wasn't going to go.

3008
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:48.68
I was, you know, today's the rest day or what?

3009
02:44:48.68 --> 02:44:49.68
I don't know, whatever.

3010
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:50.68
I wasn't going to go.

3011
02:44:50.68 --> 02:44:51.68
We can't, we call that weakness.

3012
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:54.68
Maybe, call it what you want.

3013
02:44:54.68 --> 02:44:58.68
Nonetheless, when you see pictures of, I saw,

3014
02:44:58.68 --> 02:45:02.68
I, I, I don't know the, the, the name of the specific person, but I saw a picture.

3015
02:45:02.68 --> 02:45:04.68
First day of jiu-jitsu.

3016
02:45:04.68 --> 02:45:08.68
And I'm like, you know, you get that feeling when, like, let's say you were in that jiu-jitsu.

3017
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:12.68
And I took a picture of me on the mat saying, I'm here without jockel.

3018
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:15.68
I'll do that everyone's wanting like my friends around here without jocquins.

3019
02:45:15.68 --> 02:45:19.68
You kind of like, you have this feeling like dang, I wish I was there right now, just to whatever.

3020
02:45:19.68 --> 02:45:22.68
I kind of got that feeling that weird competitiveness you were talking about.

3021
02:45:22.68 --> 02:45:25.68
No, it's more like, I want to be there with you.

3022
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:26.68
Maybe, maybe a little bit.

3023
02:45:26.68 --> 02:45:33.68
But by the way, I don't know if you do this, you know, like, guys would be like, hey, I want to come visit you at the jammer when I'm right.

3024
02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:36.68
And to me, it's like, you know, a guy showed up because when I was out of town.

3025
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:40.68
Yeah, and you know, I, I say the days like I go on these these days typically and whatever.

3026
02:45:40.68 --> 02:45:44.68
So just hit me up by the beyond Twitter, whatever, if you're in town and put he did.

3027
02:45:44.68 --> 02:45:47.68
And because the, the reason that's significant one of the main reasons what I said to,

3028
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:49.68
We're busy from Arizona.

3029
02:45:49.68 --> 02:45:51.68
So Arizona is a baby.

3030
02:45:51.68 --> 02:45:54.68
Maybe the man showed up rolled money.

3031
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:59.68
Yeah, so because a lot of people in life, I'm not saying just on Twitter, I'm just saying in life,

3032
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:02.68
They always will be like, hey, oh, you do just, so yeah, I'm going to combine.

3033
02:46:02.68 --> 02:46:05.68
You can show me or all roll or whatever.

3034
02:46:05.68 --> 02:46:10.68
And I would say a good 95 to 99% of the time, they don't, they don't come.

3035
02:46:10.68 --> 02:46:12.68
Yeah, well, a lot of times they're hitting you up from,

3036
02:46:12.68 --> 02:46:15.68
Love, please refer than the way that they're doing.

3037
02:46:15.68 --> 02:46:18.68
No, I'm even talking about like, before the podcast and stuff.

3038
02:46:18.68 --> 02:46:20.68
I'm saying like, your friends, you know,

3039
02:46:20.68 --> 02:46:25.68
Oh, just, oh, whatever, you know, yeah, you do, yeah, I'm going to come check it out.

3040
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:28.68
Sounds cool, you know, and they never had this dude rolled before.

3041
02:46:28.68 --> 02:46:31.68
AB AB, was he a judge?

3042
02:46:31.68 --> 02:46:33.68
Yes, yes, he's a judge.

3043
02:46:33.68 --> 02:46:34.68
He's a judge.

3044
02:46:34.68 --> 02:46:38.68
Yeah, he was like a three straight white belt or something like, hey, we just open up.

3045
02:46:38.68 --> 02:46:41.68
Yeah, a nice guy, you know, he's cool.

3046
02:46:41.68 --> 02:46:42.68
What's up, AB?

3047
02:46:42.68 --> 02:46:43.68

3048
02:46:43.68 --> 02:46:44.68
Thanks for coming.

3049
02:46:44.68 --> 02:46:45.68
Yeah.

3050
02:46:45.68 --> 02:46:47.68
Yeah.

02:46:47.68 --> 02:46:50.68
Yeah.

3052
02:46:50.68 --> 02:46:53.68
And obviously, he just wanted to give a shout out.

3053
02:46:53.68 --> 02:46:57.68
We talked about some soldiers today, but I want to give a thanks all the police out there.

3054
02:46:57.68 --> 02:47:01.68
I hear a lot from police officers all over the country.

3055
02:47:01.68 --> 02:47:05.68
And thanks to you guys for doing your duty to keep us safe.

3056
02:47:05.68 --> 02:47:06.68
Same thing for the firefighters.

3057
02:47:06.68 --> 02:47:10.68
I've actually, hear a lot from five, this all kinds of firefighters.

3058
02:47:10.68 --> 02:47:13.68
And all you guys are protecting us on the home front.

3059
02:47:13.68 --> 02:47:24.68
Obviously, much appreciated, and then course the military folks out there, especially those that are deployed right now, taking the fight to the enemy.

3060
02:47:24.68 --> 02:47:27.68
Be aggressive and crush them.

3061
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:29.68
And we'll see you when you get home.

3062
02:47:29.68 --> 02:47:37.68
And finally, to all the, to all the jaccopotcas, troopers out there.

02:47:37.68 --> 02:47:41.68
Thank you for the support across the board with all of us.

3064
02:47:41.68 --> 02:47:58.68
We appreciate it. And what we really appreciate more than anything is you out there in your life, taking ownership of your world and getting after it.
