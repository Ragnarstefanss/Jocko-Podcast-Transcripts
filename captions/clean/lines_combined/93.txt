00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 93 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Wilink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:29.000 I was lucky and blessed to have had the honor to serve in the United States military during a time of war.
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000 I thought alongside US Army soldiers, sailors and Marines on violent battlefields.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:55.000 And I saw with my own eyes my generation of warriors uphold the proud tradition of the American fighting man.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000 America's military has a storied history of bravery, ingenuity and grit.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000 But it's most important tradition is the tradition of victory.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000 America's military wins wars. It is as simple as that.
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:36.000 If our nation deems it morally right and excessively necessary, then our military is unstoppable.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:48.000 Of course, and rightfully so, the credit for victory is often given to the men on the front lines.
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.000 To those that are taking the fight to our nation's enemies in close combat.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000 That credit is well deserved.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000 But it is not the only credit that needs to be bestowed.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.000 Because it is a simple fact that many of the most critical victories in America's history were won not only on distant bloody battlefields,
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000 but were also won right here at home.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000 In fact, there are fields and farms.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:52.000 You see, our ability to produce, to design, grow, build and manufacture has been just important to our nation's victories as our ability to fight.
00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:05.000 And throughout history, when Americans marched to war, we marched wearing boots made by American hands.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000 We wore uniforms that were cut and sewn in factories like this one.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:26.000 Our body armor, helmets, and weapons have been the products of American work ethic, skill, and determination.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000 The best planes, ships, and vehicles in the world.
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.000 They carry us to war and then support us on the battlefield, they only exist because Americans built them.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000 Without the American worker, there can be no American soldier.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:59.000 So, let us never forget that the freedom we cherish so dearly is a gift.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:12.000 Not only from our American service men and women, but it is also a gift from the American worker.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:22.000 The American worker, who toils in fields, in factories, in shipyards, and on job sites.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000 The American worker, who gets up day after day after day, not only to build and create products.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:42.000 But also to build our economy, the strongest economy in the world, which gives us unmasked influence.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:55.000 And gives our great nation the ability to make the world a better place.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:07.000 With that knowledge, I could not be prouder to stand here today and be a part of this opening.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Not be prouder to be a part of this company, origin, which like America itself.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000 We'll succeed because of the power of the American worker.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000 It will succeed because of the power of American grit.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:40.000 An origin USA will succeed because of the unmasked power of the American dream.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:58.000 And I would like to thank all of you, especially America's workforce for making this dream possible.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:11.000 And that is a speech that I gave today in a town called Farmington Main.
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000 And I was at the opening of the new origin USA factory.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000 Now, as I've been saying, we are now in league with origin USA.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:45.000 And tonight, I have with me, our new partner and our new friend Pete Roberts, who, as you will see, has shown some pretty incredible fortitude in the business world.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000 And who I believe is just getting warmed up.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:58.000 So, Mr. Pete Roberts, founder of Origin USA, Black Belt and Giu Jitsu, by the way.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000 And also, Black Belt in making things happen.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000 Welcome to the show, man.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:18.000 I ordered to be here. Everything you just said, man, just captures everything I feel in my heart and mind for sure.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 And here in that speech live was phenomenal.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000 You know, it was awesome walking around the factory and meeting people, meeting the workers here.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000 I mean, we came in and Jill, she was, she was, it's a week of vacation of what she's doing.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000 She's in here working.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And you know, just, and I wasn't even really didn't really know what I was going to say,
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000 but after coming up here, meeting her, seeing the rest of the people grinding to make this happen.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000 Yeah, I realized that I realized exactly what I was going to say.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:58.000 I was going to talk about the fact that literally, mental in the battlefield, your, your, your propelled there by American workers.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000 And that's what this, that's what this represents.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000 And, you know, we'll get into how all this kind of came together in this kind of perfect storm.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000 Yeah, we'll get there, but we'll get there in a little while.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000 Okay.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:23.000 Because first we got to know a little about a bit about you and your crazy ass, which I say with all, you know, in the most complimentary possible way.
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000 Yeah, man.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000 So, tell us about just growing up, like, get me from like, birth to high school.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000 What was that all about?
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000 Absolutely.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000 So, and I'll start it in the sport.
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000 That's, I'm for real.
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000 Real Spartan blood.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000 For real.
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000 Yeah, I know my, my ass.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000 So, and she's clearly Greek, because I'm not clearly Greek.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 And she made that buckle a lot today.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000 Yeah.
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000 No, I thought she might pull out a Spartan sword at some point.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000 It like attacked me.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000 Yeah.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000 Which I was the least.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000 Cool.
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000 And she's pulled out a big thing of buckle.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000 Yeah.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000 And it's like sugar coated.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000 You don't care.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000 Did you feel guilty of that?
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000 No.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000 I wanted more.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000 Yeah.
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000 I know you came over like, where's all the buckle?
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000 Yeah.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000 But I looked over there's six pieces left.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000 I had four of them.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000 Did you?
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000 That's awesome.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000 No, I'm a half-breed.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 Just half Spartan.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000 So, no, yeah, man.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000 I mean, like, the rest of America, you know, my, my,
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000 grandparents, emigrated from Sparta.
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000 Greece.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 And the early 1900s, great-grand.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Live to 105 legit credit.
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000 Yes.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000 Yes.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000 My, he's even on Jockelway TV.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000 Yes.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000 He's some other shoes from Gordon.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000 I'm going through it.
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000 She, yeah.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000 No, she didn't need to be.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000 She had the Mediterranean diet.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000 No, it's not.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000 I even my son got to meet her.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000 But she lived for a long time.
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000 But yeah.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000 So, from a young age, I got to see the American dream
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000 from my mom's side of the family, you know.
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000 When we were kids, I was born down in Massachusetts,
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000 Gloucester.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000 And moved up here when I was young,
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000 she had my mom want to get myself and my three siblings.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000 Out of Massachusetts and into the woods,
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000 just because she saw some shifts happening,
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000 she didn't like.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000 So, she brought us up here and said,
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000 make a go of it, basically.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000 And what, what business or whatever, what did they, what did you,
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000 oh, why saw, I got to see my,
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000 my family built some pretty, pretty cool businesses
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000 down in Massachusetts. So, being an entrepreneur
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000 was something I always admired.
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000 But didn't realize I wanted to do that
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000 until a little later in life.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000 But my, my family down there,
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000 my grandfather had a sub shop, you know,
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000 super-sug.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000 For those of you, I don't know,
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000 there's, that's one of those things.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000 We're, they call it different things across America.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000 Yeah.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000 A sub in New England is the same thing as a subway sandwich.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000 Right, right.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Also in New England, you call it a grinder.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000 Do you call it a grinder?
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000 A grinder would be, I think, technically.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000 Ah, no, that's not a hot sandwich.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 That's hogey.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000 Oh, yeah.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Yeah, hogey's a more poor boy.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000 Oh, no.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000 That's a more poor boy.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000 Yeah.
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000 Another, another, another, a more poor boy.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000 So, sub.
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000 So, so, grandad on the sub shop.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000 A few, a few sub, which is very successful with the sandwich making.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000 Nice.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000 I got, I got to see that.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000 My cousin's built a big multi, multi,
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000 a million dollar company.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 And I, and I had to watch this from away,
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000 because I moved up to here to Maine when I was eight years old.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000 So, I wasn't cultured in that at all.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000 In the business world.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000 I didn't have anybody to teach me about business.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000 And I just got to see it and, and, and not be directly part of it,
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000 which I always wanted to be, you know,
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000 but I always looked up to them and, and what not.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000 And both from business perspective and athletics,
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000 you know, they were very good athletics, my family,
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000 and my uncles, cousins, and stuff.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000 So, I looked from afar up here in Maine in the woods,
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 and an old farmhouse down at dirt road with no neighbors.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 Cows in a field.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000 Oh, yeah.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000 That's where I grew up.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000 And then high school, you, you said you, I know you're athletic.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000 What do you, how, how tall are you?
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Six, three, and shrinking.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000 Six, three, and shrink, yeah, man.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 And what's your, what are you walking around that right now?
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 Right now, I can tell you exactly.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000 Two, fifty, three point zero.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000 Yes.
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000 But you played, what, what'd you play?
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000 I, uh, in, in high school, three-squared athlete,
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000 in college, football, division one for a couple of years.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000 Um, not the best experience of my life, learning experience,
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 but not the best.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000 Well, what, what, what wasn't the best experience in your life?
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000 I, you know, I was, I was real good at it, football.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000 Uh-huh.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000 I was not passionate about it.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Um, but I still worked my ass off.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000 Because that's the thing, you were kind of, even though you were this big,
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000 jock.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000 I was, you were also an artistic guy, right?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000 That, drawing, painting, sculpting, sculpting, everything.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000 Just doing everything.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000 And tackling people.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000 Yeah.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Getting tackle, play tight end.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000 Which, were you more passionate about art than you were about football?
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000 For sure.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000 For sure.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000 And so you're playing football, like, it, it, was it just one of those things where you,
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000 okay, I'm good at it, and I'm getting a scholarship, so I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000 Yeah, so back in 1997, Berkinadurries, yeah.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000 Oh, back in the day.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000 Yes.
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000 Yeah, no, it was, back in the day, some will remember hockey fans,
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Maine's hockey team was phenomenal.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000 They had the career kids on there.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000 And they were, that that team took gifts.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000 And what happens when you get gifts and people find out sanctions.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000 So I went into college and they had like 10 scholarships.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000 So I didn't actually have a scholarship till my second year of college.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000 I kind of had to prove myself.
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000 And I work my ass off.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000 And then I fell into the politics of college football.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000 And I saw the ugly side of the politics of college football.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000 And what are you talking about?
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000 Because I'm the only guy sitting at the table that it had an apparently play college football.
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000 It was football. It was busy in the teams.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000 What do you think?
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000 What does that consist of?
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000 Like you're trying to get to be in the certain position starting or is that what's
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000 talking about?
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000 Let's say like, OK, yeah.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000 So I was supposed to start my, I read,
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000 I read, my freshman, I was supposed to start.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Tighten, got into a bar bra, right?
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000 And during the summer couldn't play the first few games.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000 And it was me and one of my friends.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000 And we were both freshman.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000 And he was a big kid, local kid.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000 He ended playing in the NFL.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000 And we were kind of like fighting for the first spot on the depth chart.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000 And the depth chart for those of you who don't know is like kind of where you stand.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000 And you see your name on there.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 And you see everyone else's name.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000 And you want to be the top guy.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000 Right?
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000 So you bring that out for every position?
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 Oh, yeah.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 Oh, yeah.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000 Every position.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Check.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000 Yeah.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000 So a little pressure to perform.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000 And I stayed after my freshman, I put on 27 pounds of like hard earned muscle.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000 No illegal substances,
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 Scrots, McDonald's,
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000 and Scrots.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000 They be like, go eat some food.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000 That McDonald's.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000 So what did you, what, what would you go from what weight to what weight?
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000 And I came into college at like,
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000 two,
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000 it was like,
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000 200 in like,
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 225 in you and a little less.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000 Oh, 10.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000 Oh, 10.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And then yeah,
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000 and then just earned it.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000 earned it in the gym.
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000 I remember my tight end coach coming up to me and saying,
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000 hey, you know, Steve is his name.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000 He's like, he's out.
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000 And he's like, you're going to be starting this first game.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000 And I'm like, shit.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000 I mean, I stayed, I stayed like, work my ass off.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000 You know, stayed during breaks and everything.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000 And I was a good athlete.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000 Yeah.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000 And what's cool is, you're actually going as hard as you can.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 Yeah.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000 You weren't even that passionate at all, but I committed to it.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000 You just wanted to win.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Yes.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000 Yeah.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 No, I do it.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000 You look at yourself in that depth chart.
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Even if you don't necessarily like what you're doing,
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000 you make the commitment and you drive.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000 And I didn't want to be number two.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000 You know, so it's super competitive college sports.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000 So anyways, the, my tight end coach,
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000 like, you're starting the first game.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000 I'm like, yes.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Call all my family, call all my friends,
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000 tell them what's up.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000 Make sure everybody has tickets.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000 I could day before the game.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000 The coach comes to me and says,
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Pete, I gotta talk to you.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 Nice to see him.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Okay? He's like, I just got in a huge argument with a head coach.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000 And you will not be starting in the football game.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000 I said, okay, why?
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000 He goes,
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000 basically told me politics.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000 My friend, still a friend of mine,
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000 local kid.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000 He came in on a full ride.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000 Local kid, big kid,
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000 had probably a better frame to build on.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000 And basically what the,
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000 even though maybe,
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000 you know, it's college.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000 We have different gifts.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000 The head coach shut it down and said,
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000 nope, he's not starting.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000 My coach is like, he should start.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000 He's performing better.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000 You know, he's strong in the weight room.
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000 Hand cleaning 300 pounds.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000 The kids ready to go.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000 He should be starting.
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000 They got a huge fight.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000 Almost got fired.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000 The coach, my, my head and coach,
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000 I'm scared fired.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000 He said, you'll be playing a lot in the game though.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000 But yeah, he'll be starting.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000 Guess how much playing time I saw.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000 No, zero.
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000 So that was the first game of the season you said.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000 Yeah.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000 And so then what happens?
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000 You grind out the rest of the season?
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000 Yeah, man.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000 How's your attitude?
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000 I worked my ass off and turned.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000 Turn, you kept grind to earn.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000 Did you ever start?
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000 Here's the shitty thing.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000 I've already sounded pretty shitty.
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000 Yeah, actually.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000 It's pretty shitty, dude.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 Here's the shitty thing.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 Man, I couldn't, I'm telling you,
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 I had football PTSD after this.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000 I didn't watch football for 10 years.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000 They put on television.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000 I'd walk out of the room.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000 I just hang out, do something else.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000 They'd be watching the games.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000 My son loves football.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000 My, my family loves football.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000 Couldn't do it.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000 I had like a, just not version to the sport to make a long story short.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000 My, this has been 45 minutes.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000 We haven't even made a pass.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000 Shut up.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000 Has it been?
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Has it?
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000 No, my, my, my, my scholarship, the money, like,
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000 like some of the money hit your count, right?
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000 And like, shit didn't kick in for like my
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000 food and everything and like my coach, the head coach.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000 Who was a narcissistic guy?
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000 Love coming to the weight room and just like waving his hair and you know,
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000 I don't know what it's got.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000 You know what it's got.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000 Yeah, college money.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000 Great.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000 He's like, I'll take care of it.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000 Pete, let's find everything's happening.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000 Okay.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000 Weak later.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000 Coach still, this, this isn't, you know,
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000 I'm, I'm on it.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000 I'm on it.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.000 I'm on it.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000 I'm talking with the AD.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000 It's everything's good.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000 Weak later.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000 Coach, it's still like, man, I'm stressing.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000 You know, like, I'm going to have to get a job, like,
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000 what's up with this?
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000 He goes, I need to talk to you my office.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000 Is it okay?
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000 I sit down in his office.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Your scholarship money is not going to kick in.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000 Really?
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000 I overgave.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Title IX had kicked in.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000 I'm going to get a job.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Title IX had kicked in, and he overgave.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000 Now, is he being truthful with me?
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000 Or did he find a new recruit that was better?
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000 Did he push me out?
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000 Who knows?
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000 I don't know why because the kid behind me ended up starting full back the next year.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000 Right?
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000 So, maybe I got pushed out.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000 Maybe he overgave.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000 Back to the matter is that bastard lied to me.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000 I didn't fall through with his word.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000 And that will never happen again.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000 I will never surround myself with those types of people.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 And that lesson I carry to this day.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000 I think about it a lot.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000 It's one of those moments in your life that kind of changes your life.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000 I said, you know, I'll tell you something.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000 I worked my balls off for you in this program.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000 I'm ready.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000 And this is what I get.
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000 That excuse out out of the office.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000 I grabbed my cleats and then into my body Chad Rogers and walked out the door and didn't look back.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000 That was that.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000 So, that was your sophomore year.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000 Yeah, that would have been my red shirt.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000 It was right after my wrist.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000 Yeah, sophomore year.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 Yeah.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000 So, what are you studying at this time?
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000 Studying a new media.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000 Which was really new because remember the internet hit like 97.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000 The 80 became hot, right?
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000 Really?
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000 There's a data on that.
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000 Yeah.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000 Pretty ambiguously.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000 Like you can call it 97.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Yeah.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000 That's when it became hot.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Yeah.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Yeah.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000 Like I think so.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.000 Yeah.
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000 For sure.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000 That's when it was like the internet.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000 Yeah.
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000 Everybody need everybody.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000 What is it?
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000 Yeah.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.000 Yeah.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000 Net skating.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000 Yeah.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000 But you know, you could really surf the web.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000 Yeah.
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000 Okay.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000 So, web sites and stuff.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000 Yeah.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Yeah.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000 So, I'm in and flat this flash hit.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000 It came out, back in media, all the stuff.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000 So anyways, I was into that.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:50.000 I discovered the computer thing and fell in love with design on the computer.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000 And although I was a sculpture major, I used a well-dop crazy looking shit.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000 I actually zipped her to co-post.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000 Dude, I did.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000 For like my final project, you want to know what I did?
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000 Yeah.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000 I built this big frigging zipper on this canvas.
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000 And I erected it and I zipped it up the pole post.
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 I'm talking about the, like the, like the, like the, like a giant real zipper.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000 Real zipper.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000 You know, like the thing, the thing you hold the, yeah, that dude, it was this big.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000 I zipped my, my, my art teacher.
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000 They allowed you to do that.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000 They'd have a choice.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000 I just went out and did it.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000 So it's down.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000 Yeah.
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000 And what's that like street art?
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000 I don't even know what I'm speaking.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000 I love art.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000 Yeah.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.000 It was weird.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 I think I got some of that frustration out of you for shivering it up.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000 Yeah.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000 I have never told anybody that.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000 Do something to my, my, my, my, my, my, my,
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000 Did you get graded on it?
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000 Yeah, dude.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000 So how did you not tell anybody?
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000 Because what happened was, is I erected it in the practice field.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000 And my teacher, she walked over with me to look at it.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And she looked at me and she was, she said, a plus.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000 Wait, they should be, you did it.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000 Like you did in this, like you did in this, like,
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000 She looked at me and she goes, she looked at me and she goes,
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000 She said, what?
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 She, she didn't think it was possible.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000 Bro, when you said like I zippered my goal,
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000 plus I'm sitting here thinking, what is this?
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000 Some slang term that I don't know about.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000 Does that mean hanging toilet paper off of it?
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000 Like, where does this mean?
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000 It means zippering.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000 I wish I had a photo of it.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000 I wish you did.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000 We didn't have digital cameras back then.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000 Yeah, but that teacher was cool.
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000 She was, I remember her name, but she was cool.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000 And you left it up for the practice.
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000 Guys, when they shut up, pull it down.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000 She actually, she actually,
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Toped pulled me aside one time and she's like,
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000 you drive this class.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000 How, what you do and how you act,
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000 everyone is going to follow basically.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000 She was, she was pretty cool,
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000 but that is a gentle vengeance.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000 It's very much, I'll give you props.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000 zipper that zipper it done.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:51.000 zipper it.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000 You wait, not that's happening.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000 I'll tell as a goal post.
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000 Man, I think we should call it.
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000 35 feet, 30 feet, probably more than,
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000 like, the full go,
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000 open.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000 That depends with the practice field.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000 It helps you.
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000 It's full zipper.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000 I am not even kidding.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000 I put that, I put in the, and I built it out of,
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000 like, wood-laminated band saw, like,
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000 all the lugs and I had the 50 get the perfectly in that whole zipper part had the zip.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000 It was functional.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000 Yes.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000 It was a giant zipper.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000 That's good.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000 I love she's like, I told my teacher,
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000 I was new.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000 She's like, impossible to make it function.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000 Okay, let's see.
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000 Yeah.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000 Yeah.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 That guy mentioned that earlier.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000 Yeah.
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000 And at this time, what,
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000 are you, what's like going on personally, personal life?
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 Do you want you with your high school sweet heart at the world?
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000 So, I, my wife Amanda, my bride.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000 We got together.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000 We were 16, 15, 16,
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000 through, through a difficult situation.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 We became friends.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000 And we've been together for a sense.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000 We were drawn together by a difficult situation.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000 And you stayed together through college.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000 Absolutely.
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000 And she wasn't looking at you like, like,
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000 I need to get away from this guy.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000 Yeah, the zipper goes.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000 You know, she, she's very understanding.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000 I'm sharing it.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000 Yeah.
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000 Yeah, you know, the court in line, like, you complete me.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000 Like, she, I tell people like,
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000 she, if my glass is a little full,
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000 she just dumped some out.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000 And if it's running a little dry, she puts it back in.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000 So, and she always has, you know what I mean?
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000 So, she's brutally honest.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000 And, you know, she's like, my soulmate.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000 I, that's awesome that you guys were, you know,
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000 I knew that.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000 But it's kind of cool that you guys did.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000 You've got to get it all that time.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Now, back to your, your major.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000 And now you're saying, I'm playing football.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000 Oh, no. You're sitting there in college.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000 Yep. You're studying new media, which no one knows anything about.
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000 I don't even know anything about it.
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000 And we actually hired the professors, my class.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000 Really?
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000 We had a, we committee of students and we hired the frequent professors.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000 And so, and so then you're learning how to do what?
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000 For build websites.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:07.000 Yeah.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000 Stuff like this.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000 You're learning things like, uh,
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000 It's what all like the first software hit you had like this Maya.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 And you could do 3D animation.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000 They built like, I don't toy story and Maya or something.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000 You had like flash, macromedia.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000 Remember the flash websites, all the animation.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:23.000 Yeah.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000 Stuff like that.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000 So we, I learned about that.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000 So how did you make the jump from that to going into business in that arena?
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000 I was good at it.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000 And I was passionate about it.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000 And what happened is my sophomore year after I got on playing football.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000 I went right to a marketing agency.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000 Sold myself on the spot and got hired on the spot.
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000 And I became their lead web developer.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000 And you're like 19.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000 I was 19 with blonde hair.
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000 Nice.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000 Yep.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000 They were like, who is this kid?
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000 For the record is when I was 19, I had blonde hair too.
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000 No kid.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000 Yeah.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000 It's a lot of similarities.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000 That's cool.
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000 Well, a lot of Hawaiians have blonde hair.
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000 So.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000 So 19 with blonde hair, yeah, man.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 I walked in and I just sold myself.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Okay.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000 So then how did that morph into your own business?
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000 Yeah.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000 So I wasn't going to push job.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000 I take it if you're the lead at 19 years old.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000 Push job at 200 bucks a week, buddy.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000 Raking.
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000 Which I needed to do.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000 Which was pretty legit for you though, right?
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000 Yeah.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000 Because it was either that or the YMCA.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000 You know, and I did work at the Y.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000 But yeah.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000 I mean, it was.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000 I caught my teeth at this ad agency where I learned from this really good.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000 Graphic designer Brad, who started his career doing paste up.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000 So paste up is like when you're designing an ad, you actually have to take an exact.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000 So all the little tools you use when you're in like Photoshop and other programs.
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000 Those are real tools, real life tools.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000 So he take like the knife and cut around the picture and then he put that.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000 And then like the typography.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000 So I cut my teeth under a real designer.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000 Not many people get that anymore.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000 So I learned from a master of design and how long did you stay at that ad agency?
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000 I was there till I was 19, 20, 21, 3 years I think.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000 And then I moved back and I started my own company here.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000 And that was just in Sparado.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000 What made you say, you know what?
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000 But you must have seen a pathway at the agency to take over or not even take over.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000 But just to move up the chain of command and get paid more than 200 bucks a week and all that.
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000 I did.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000 What in your brain clicked were you like, you know what?
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000 I'm not working for the man.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000 Yeah, absolutely.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000 I'll tell you that.
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000 I got to go back to give you that though.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000 Raking blueberries and throwing hay.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000 Manual labor.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000 Throw hay for a day and get a $10 real.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000 You're going to work very hard not to do that.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000 Raking blueberries and Maine, which is a staple of us.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000 Mane is that's tough work.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000 You're bent over in the sun in the blueberry fields.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000 And guess what you do for your first week, you earn your rake.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000 So what does that mean?
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000 There's a different job that you use the rake picking or something.
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000 You've got a bottle of rake.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000 You're in debt.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000 You're in debt.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000 You start and you give you the rake and you have to work it off.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000 How much do you think that rake cost?
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000 I'm doing the math.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000 I'm like.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000 I'm like, this is tough.
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000 But I like it.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000 So when I walked into my interview at this marketing agency,
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000 this kind of a pompous kid, I said,
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000 he said, what do you want to do long term?
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000 Mark, I said, start my own business.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000 I'm going to own my own business.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 He goes, you don't want to do that.
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000 You do not want to own your own business.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000 You don't know what it takes to survive in a world of business.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000 And I said, okay.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Proceed.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Then I learned in sucked the knowledge I could.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000 All the knowledge I could.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000 I just sucked it and sucked it and sucked it.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000 And then I moved home and started.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000 And what city was that?
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000 I started.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000 Well, I started the business out of my college apartment.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000 It was about as big as this table.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 I was the man though.
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000 I had a little a Mac.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000 The black one, Wall Street.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000 There was a mall.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000 There was a mall.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000 It had like a, it was black and had like rubber on the sides.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000 You know what I mean?
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000 That's a U of the man.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000 Yeah.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000 And I think that thing caused me some issues because it was very tough to have kids.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000 I sat that thing on my lap for hours on end.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000 And I'm telling you, something was really Haitian.
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000 Man, I had to practice a lot to have kids.
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000 Practice was good, but it got a little tough when it was like,
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000 I can't have kids.
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000 So, but yeah, man, I started the business out of my college apartment.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000 My first insight and new media marketing agency and new media company.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000 And just started hammering.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000 And I was fearless going after accounts and clients.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000 You know, and two years later, I find myself in Park City, Utah sitting in the front of the president of
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000 Rosakna, I'll click so we're selling them an idea like Bill Gates, I didn't exist yet.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000 I'm telling them what I could do and then they gave me the money to do it.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000 And then we did it.
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000 And the rest of history.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000 So, so everything was rocking.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000 And so it's a long day.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000 Did you, so you were in your college apartment, but then where did you end up?
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 I ended up here in my hometown.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000 And you had space.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000 You got an office in all nine yards?
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Yeah, well, I started in a barn.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000 And it was me and another guy, my first hire.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000 And then we moved into kind of like a double wide trailer in house.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000 You know, we call it a double wide.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Did it have a skirt?
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000 Okay.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 You're using a different figure right?
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000 Did it have a skirt?
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000 It's a vinyl skirt.
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000 You kidding me?
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.000 Yeah.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000 Who doesn't have a vinyl skirt?
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000 Gotta keep it real.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000 So we went there and then we moved into a basement in town.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000 This is like the perfect progression.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000 Right?
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000 Yeah.
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000 And then we hired a few more.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000 And then we moved into a beautiful, we had built out a studio where, man, it was,
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000 we actually designed it.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000 Because you were making legit money now.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000 We were.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000 How many employees are we talking about?
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 I think maybe seven or so.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Okay.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000 Something like that.
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000 And now you're 22.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Yeah.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000 If that, yeah, yeah.
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000 Probably 22.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000 Getting out of 22 years old.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000 Yeah.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000 Six employees.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.000 Yeah.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000 Custom design office.
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000 So we did everything.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000 You want to hear something?
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000 I don't know if I should say this.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.000 Okay.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000 You ready for this?
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000 You may have to edit this out.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000 All right.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000 I handled two governors campaigns in Maine.
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000 22 years old.
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000 They wanted to like the best design, the best marketing.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000 So they came to these youngins.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000 Mm-hmm.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000 And we had this one guy, less often.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000 Should maybe you not say the name?
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000 It was a national news.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000 Sorry.
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000 I want to.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000 You can cut it out.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000 Understood.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000 Really national news.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000 No.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000 It's national news.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000 Okay.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000 Really nice guy.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000 Right after Obama's first term.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000 So less came and he wanted us to handle his campaign.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000 And so he wanted a logo that was circular like Obama's logo.
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000 And so we did a eye design myself a circular logo, which green and blue.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000 Very similar feel.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000 Not even close to the same, but it was around.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000 And who had done a round logo at that time?
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000 Next thing I know, this thing ends up on CNN, all the national news stations.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000 And they have like the two logos.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000 They have Obama's logo.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000 Okay.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000 And less is logo.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000 I've got it.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000 Of influx of emails and phone calls.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000 People like RIPIC.
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000 Because remember how that first term for Obama?
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000 Remember how hot that was.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000 Yeah.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000 Remember why were people negative when they were negative on you?
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000 Because they were like we ripped it off.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000 And I was like really, really.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000 So it was round.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000 Don't make a round logo.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000 Yeah.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Especially after the first Obama.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000 They don't use circles.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000 Don't use circles.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000 They say that's like that's what they're saying.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000 Don't use circles.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000 So anyways, it was it was an interesting time.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000 There's a little bit of stress.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000 Did he catch heat for it?
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000 Obviously.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Yeah.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.000 Yeah.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000 Because no one really cared that you don't know.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000 Even knew that like some.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000 He wasn't like, oh my, I had agency made it up.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000 And I thought it was great.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000 No, well, he, you know what they, you know, kind of a little bit.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000 He did that.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000 But he had an advice advisor that said, this is the right direction and whatnot.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000 So it was, it was interesting times.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000 So what was the heat?
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000 The heat was like national media like ripping you down.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000 People dig down who designed it.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000 Like when company that designed it and just like tearing you off.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000 They found you your book picture.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000 It was a straight.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000 It was like Obama.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000 It was like 15 days of like holy shit.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000 Like we're going to survive this as a company, you know.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000 And we did.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000 Yeah.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000 Yeah.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000 And so you, you survived that.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:23.000 Yeah.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000 And I guess your lesson is like from that that you can survive things.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000 You're going to like it's interesting.
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000 I just caught that you said 15 days.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000 Yeah.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000 Because guess what?
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 15 days no one cared anymore.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000 Is that pretty much pretty much.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000 Yeah.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000 I see that a lot in the news. You know, people, some people freak out about something.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 And I'm like, yeah, I wait.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000 I'll wait a week.
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 Four or four days.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000 Something else anymore.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000 There's like some other media that hit the satellite thing or whatever.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000 Yeah.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000 So it was, it was interesting.
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000 You know, we were young, you know, in naive, you know.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000 I mean, I think all entrepreneurs start out naive honestly.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000 And from a leadership perspective, you're in a leadership position.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000 Yeah.
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000 Right. For the first time.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000 Yeah.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000 And you have a team of six people.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000 Yeah.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000 You're the man.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.000 Yep.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000 And I'm trusting.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000 You see, you say that little hesitation.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000 Yeah.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000 I trust that people will do the right thing.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000 Are the people that are working for you, your age?
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000 Yeah.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.000 Younger.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000 Just all the things.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Same age.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Year two difference.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000 Okay.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000 All young.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000 So now you said recession.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000 What happens there?
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Well, we were kind of like booming as a company building.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000 So it's an incredible, we would do interactive touch screen.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000 Key asks and all this really, really cool shit.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000 What that nobody was doing yet.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000 Recession hit.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000 We lost 65% of our business overnight.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000 We once the first thing you cut in a recession advertising.
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000 You're not supposed to.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000 But you do.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000 It's a wrong move.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000 But it's the move that everyone makes.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000 Yeah, man.
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000 I probably make the same move.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000 Where can we cut costs?
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000 Add spend.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000 Right?
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000 Stop that.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000 Anyways, the recession hit.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000 And we had built this company from like the ground up.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000 Just funneled the money back into the company.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000 Bill built by equipment, build this to do all this stuff.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000 I'm like, oh shit.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000 First time I thought about like these guys bought houses here.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000 Have families, are starting families.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000 Move away.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000 How long had the run been at this point?
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000 This had been five years.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000 That's a good question.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000 What is the recession eight or nine?
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000 This is six, seven year run.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000 Okay.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000 Six.
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000 So yeah, these guys had established their lives.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000 They established their families up here.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000 Yes.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000 They you were the form of income.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000 You're how they're paying their mortgage.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000 Absolutely.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000 And I felt that.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000 You know, I don't know if that's a weakness.
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000 But I'm sensitive to that, man.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000 I that if I promise somebody something like this company is your future.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000 I mean this company is your future.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000 I will stop taking a paycheck and that's not the right thing to do.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000 You got to always pay yourself right.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000 I will stop taking a paycheck to make sure you get yours.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000 That's what I did.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 And what I also did is I took out a line of credit.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000 It was the first money I had taken out from the bank ever.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.000 And I used that money to keep things going to try to get through the recession.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000 And I didn't want to lay anybody off.
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000 What I had them do was I had them start designing in house.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000 Because by the way, the next thing that you do after you cut advertising, the biggest cost
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000 just about any business there is is your people.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000 So that's the next thing that gets cut.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000 But you're saying you're not going to do that.
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000 And I'm young.
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000 Yeah.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000 And learning about business as I go, you know.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 So no, I'm not going to do it.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000 No, they some of them bought houses and stuff.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000 You know, like I'm not taking away their livelihood.
00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000 You know, I'll find a way to just get through, right?
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000 You know.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000 And I believe I had the fortitude to get through, you know.
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000 But.
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000 And there's the butt.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000 They didn't.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000 And here's why because I had them start working on in house projects.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000 And I was training jujitsu at the time.
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000 And so I was going to develop a platform.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000 So that an academy could build a website based off of a template.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000 A system for their jujitsu school.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000 And it was going to be badass.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000 And we had done this for like, Rossignol and Dean of Star.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000 We had, we were like one of the first companies to build online tools to build things.
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000 Makes sense.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000 Mm-hmm.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000 There's a night, it early 2000s.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000 So we're going on and you look at some product and you want to,
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000 There's a little customization that can be done to it.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000 You guys, the design things to move the mouse around.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.000 Yeah.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000 The bunch of those now, but it was a bunch of, it was none of them.
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000 Okay.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000 So we started building this thing.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000 And you're building this thing, but you're not being paid for it yet.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000 Because eventually we're going to sell it.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.000 Right.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000 That's what you're doing.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000 Now, did you jujitsu take a little bit more of my time than it should have?
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 You know, these things happen.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000 Yeah.
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000 Did I think about it more than anything else in the world?
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000 I did.
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000 And just real quick, how'd you get it in a jujitsu?
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000 Well, after football, I stopped playing football.
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000 And I was like, man, I need to fight.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000 I always had this desire to fight.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Maybe I'll men have that.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000 I don't know, but I felt like many extra extra.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000 Like extra.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000 Like I need to fight.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000 So I'm like tycoando.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000 So I started fighting in tycoando and achieved that in about two years.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000 I was like, okay.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000 Now what?
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 And then I found jujitsu.
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000 And I got choked out by 150 pound kid.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000 And I was 285 pounds.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000 And I was like, that's a conventor.
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000 I'm in.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000 Configured out.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000 I came at him with every bit of athleticism.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000 The kid choked me out.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000 I was cold.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000 Yeah.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000 I had what just happened.
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000 And I bought into it.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000 So many out.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Anyways, I was passionate about jujitsu.
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000 And I had this perfect plan to build a system.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000 And they started getting salty about it.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000 Now is that because they felt like there wasn't income.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000 It's because they weren't getting paid by the project.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Getting commissioned or something like that.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000 What were they getting salty about?
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000 They all got salaries.
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000 So what were they getting salty about?
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000 The fact that they were working on my pet projects.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000 Those words, my pet projects.
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000 They were also salty.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000 I had two very young kids in my wife in the office.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000 That the kids were in the office.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000 And they were playing with their stuff.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000 And doing what kids do.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000 They're being kids.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000 My company, my office, my kids.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000 Okay.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000 They found that a problem.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000 So out of the menu.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000 What was your relationship?
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000 Because this, I'm just assuming right now that you got a bunch of people that are working for you that are around the same age as you.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Yep.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000 And so I'm guessing that you're kind of growing out with them.
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000 Superb rows.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Superb rows.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000 Superb rows.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000 Superb rows.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000 The immature kids.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000 Right.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000 Talented immature kids.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000 I mean, you're talking about like, hey, let's shut it down and go snowboarding.
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000 We've got two inches of pow pow, unsure below.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000 You know, and we need to hit that.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000 And as we do, we just shut it down.
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000 Grab the snowping or a rosy gnaw would send us like $10,000 from product.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000 We just, we just go up.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Just rip on the mountain.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000 Hey, man, just get the work done.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 You know, oh, you need to, yeah, man, no worries.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000 Just do, just make sure the work's done.
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000 Yep.
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000 Very loose.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000 Superb rows.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000 Superb rows.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000 Talented.
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000 Yes.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 Hit the pow pow.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000 Let's do it.
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000 The powder.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:09.000 So, yeah, man, the relationship was not a boss worker employee relationship.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000 It was a creative.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000 I always wanted to, we had a fuzball table.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000 And the, you know, and give me a break.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000 I mean, it's a creative agency.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000 Yep.
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000 Yep.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000 Yep.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000 But when shit hits the fan, the fingers go to one person.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000 This guy, right?
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000 So, all right.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000 I'm ready to sustain this thing to make it happen.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000 They weren't.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000 So, one day, I'm in my wife's office.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000 And the whole crew gets up and hands me a paper.
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000 And it's a thick paper.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000 And they're like, we'll see you on Monday to talk about this.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Because they thought they weren't expendable.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000 Okay.
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000 So, they're giving you an ultimatum.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000 Ultimatum.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000 I was like, I turned white for a second.
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000 I was like, okay.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000 And they walked out.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000 Were you, did you anticipate this at all?
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 No.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000 Yeah.
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000 No idea.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000 I would never be caught off guard like that again.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000 Yeah, that one's going to speak.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000 That one's going to leave a mark.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000 This isn't, isn't mutiny.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000 That's a huge straight up mutiny.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000 Yep.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000 Okay.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000 My wife is an emotional being.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000 We sat down and we read this paper.
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000 And it was a list of demands.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000 A list of demands about profit sharing.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000 How the company was making all this money.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000 And it wasn't being filtered down to the employees.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:43.000 And about my kids and how they cannot come into the office anymore.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000 Because they make noise.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000 A whole list of demands.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000 They can't concentrate when they're playing food's ball.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000 Yeah.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000 And yeah, amongst other things.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000 Young, stupid kids.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000 Yeah.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000 And I was one of them.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000 Yeah.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000 Because I was naive.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000 So we started looking to this thing.
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:10.000 And I was like, wow, it's like, I can punch in the face.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000 And my wife went, thing.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000 And she spun up.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000 And she's, she's French Canadian.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000 And she's, she's, you know, yeah, anyway.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000 She spun up.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000 That's okay.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000 Does she speak French when she's angry?
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000 No.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:26.000 Okay.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000 I wish that would be kind of hard.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000 She did.
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000 I was from around.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000 I'm like, maybe speak French.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000 Just make your madzans to get yell at you and do that.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000 Yeah.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000 No.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.000 So, so what we did is we just, we sat there and looked at each other and we're like, what?
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000 And I said, did they have any idea?
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000 We just took out a line of credit to support this place to get through the recession.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000 Did they have any idea we don't have any work?
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000 So what do we do?
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000 Recon.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:06.000 We opened up their computers, logged in and started looking for all the interaction between the staff.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000 And wow.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000 What they thought of me?
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000 I was sad.
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000 I was like, wow.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000 This is sad.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000 Maybe you feel like shit.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000 What do they think?
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000 I mean, they thought I was like, some type of miser, like, squirling, weight, cash, and resources.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 Yeah.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000 Because I was kept a straight face, a happy personality.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000 They had no idea how much in the whole we were.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000 Yeah.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 And I can imagine that you're trying to actually protect them from the stress of business.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000 Yes.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000 And in doing that, you didn't communicate to them what was actually happening, which meant that they created
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000 What was happening in their own minds, which was obviously wrong.
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000 They're creating what they think reality is in their minds when they don't know all the facts.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000 There's so many times in business when I talk to businesses and business are going through
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000 transitions or there's something happening.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.000 They'll be asking, well, do you think we should tell the employees what's happening?
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000 Right.
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000 And I'm like, well, you have two choices.
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000 You can tell them what's happening.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000 Are they going to make up a story?
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000 They're going to make up a story.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000 And it's not going to be good.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000 They're going to think worst case scenario.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000 And so the open communications that is how you prevent this kind of thing.
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000 And obviously, you're 22 years old. That's pretty awesome that you were in the position you were in.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000 And obviously, you can look back now.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000 And it's pretty simple to see what the solutions were.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000 One of them you were you were growing out with these guys too much.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000 And this is a fine line, you know, because, you know, in a super tune, I had
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000 Bros.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000 Lifetime brothers.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Yeah.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000 That were, you know, three or four ranks below me.
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000 But they were professional.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000 And they understood the line between and they understood.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000 And they respected the position.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000 And then there's other guys that were, you know, that same rank,
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000 lower rank that I couldn't give that kind of closeness to.
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000 And so that's one of those things that, you know, we talk about a lot with companies
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000 is it's different for the different people in your company.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000 So I'm not saying you can't grow out with people.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000 And also, that doesn't mean you don't have awesome relationships with your people.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 Because that's what you want.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000 You want to have awesome relationships with the people that are working for you.
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000 Because they're going to do that much more for you and you can do that much more for them.
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000 And it becomes a functional winning team because everyone cares about each other.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000 Exactly.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000 There's a dichotomy there.
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000 You know, are we being, there's a line?
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000 Are we super bros?
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000 What is that line?
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000 What is that line?
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000 And that line is the thing that you need to figure out.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000 What makes it really hard with the relationship pieces that it's different for different
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000 people.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000 And I had some guys that wasn't even five in a single tune.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000 And I was the lieutenant and they were my total bros.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000 And there's another guy that's in the five and I got to keep a little distance just so they make sure that they
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000 They stay professional.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000 Right.
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000 And so this is this is challenging stuff and great lessons learned for anyone to run into business.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000 Especially young people.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000 But it's not just young people because I see seasoned CEOs asking these same questions.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000 You don't learn this shit in college.
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 I'm so sorry.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:16.000 You know, like being an entrepreneur, business man or woman, whatever.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000 It's learned, you know, you may have a gift of something or a good counting.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000 Maybe a good sales person or good marketing or somebody's born with a gift to be an entrepreneur.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:34.000 You know, it's built, it's crafted over time and you have to fail and fall flat on your face and get punched in the face to figure it out.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000 Yeah.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000 So.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000 But what's good is, unfortunately, there's those lessons that your parents tried to teach you, but you didn't listen to.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 And they come out of this.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000 And if you're even aware of them, and that's what's good about like someone that's hearing what you're saying right now.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000 They, they might not recognize it before.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000 And this is a chapter in extreme ownership, right?
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000 That got to me of leadership and you got to be, you can't be so close to your people that ones more important to it.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000 We go through this, right?
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000 But the awareness of it is it gives people a percentage chance of maybe instead of falling flat on their face.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000 Maybe they just stumble and they're able to recover.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000 Right.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000 So this is, you know, classic.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000 I felt flat.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000 Yes.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000 Do it hurt too.
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Oh, so what happens?
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000 So I was, I was sad man at first.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 Then I got angry.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000 And then I got even.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 No.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000 No.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:31.000 I, basically what it was is we are not expendable.
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000 Heed these words and these demands.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000 And we'll talk to you Monday morning.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000 Okay.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000 So what happens?
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000 We do a little recon.
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000 Get into the computers.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 See the communication between all of them.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.000 What they thought about me, what they thought about my wife.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000 What they thought was going on with the company.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000 Half an hour later, I'm in my vehicle, divide and conquer.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000 You're not going to tell me, because in that paper, it said, do not come in see us individually.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000 Do not seek us out.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000 Do not try to separate one of us and have a conversation.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000 And that's exactly what I did.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:18.000 By the way, from the employee standpoint, this is a horrible move.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000 They are making doop as bad of a mistake as you were making as a leader.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.000 Because what they should have any one of them could have done is said, Pete, bro, I got to talk to you man.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000 Let me tell you what's going on.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000 Yeah.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000 This is what we're thinking.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000 We don't know what's going on with the company.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000 You've got us working on these random projects that are like your projects.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000 We should be working for other companies.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Can you tell us what God's name is going on so we can move forward?
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000 That's one of those people.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000 Nobody was that mature.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000 And you could have brought him into a room and said, hey guys, I apologize for not telling you.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000 But let me tell you what income we have on the next six months.
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000 Nothing.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000 Nothing.
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000 So this is what we're going to do to try and survive.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000 You could have given the plan they would understand why you're doing what you're doing.
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000 And it would have been good.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000 So both sides of the chain of command, there are actually making grievous mistakes.
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000 I had mistakes.
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000 And I learned from that that was, I mean, I'm a transparent person as it is.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000 You can ask me anything you want.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000 And I will answer it.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000 I was just a dumb kid though.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000 I didn't want to show weakness to them.
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000 Is what I was thinking.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Right.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000 Because I didn't want them to feel like they needed to go find another job.
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000 I didn't want them to think that start talking like all the companies are going to shut down.
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000 I was making my own stories.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000 I didn't trust they would make the right decision if I told them this.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000 So I just carried on to try to push through.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000 And you're right, it was a mistake to not share it with them.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000 Because it would have been, I was, we were bleeding as a company.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000 But they were, the blood I was trying to keep in.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000 It would have been easier just to let them decide what they wanted to do after and hindsight,
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000 telling them where we were as a company, how the recession had affected us.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000 But I didn't.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000 And so I divided and conquered.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Meaning I got to my goal.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000 Drive to the first one's house.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000 Knock on the door.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000 John.
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000 We're going to talk or you have no job.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000 John still with me right now.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 He works for Origin.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000 Sweet.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000 I was pissed.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000 I was so pissed.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000 I was crying a little bit.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000 I was pissed.
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000 You've been so pissed like you're just like, you cried.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000 Yes.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:23.000 Negative.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000 Next question.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Really?
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000 I don't know.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000 I don't know.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000 I don't know.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000 I guess I guess I'm talking about being a kid.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000 Seven.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000 I'm talking like 20, what am I?
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000 23, 24, something like that.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 Yes.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000 I was in the deems at that point.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Yeah.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Okay.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000 It's not happening.
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000 This is a one talk to.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000 Yeah.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 Yeah.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000 Echo.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000 I'm having a conversation with you.
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000 I know.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000 I really like this.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 I hope that you have the kind of behavior you
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000 have of every kid.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000 I've been lying to you.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.04 It's like you are the only one he's in
00:55:19.04 --> 00:55:19.000 alguns to say
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000 are you lonely?
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000 Who's it?
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000 Who's it?
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.32 When I was a kid, I had one mentor, my buddy's father,
00:55:27.32 --> 00:55:30.72 because it was a single mom who was,
00:55:30.72 --> 00:55:34.44 just we, our kids, we a lot of the time we raised ourselves.
00:55:34.44 --> 00:55:37.32 I didn't have a mentor, now I have a father figure around
00:55:37.32 --> 00:55:42.36 all the time to see how to, so I just, I worked off of
00:55:42.36 --> 00:55:44.52 pure drive and emotion.
00:55:44.52 --> 00:55:47.48 Yeah, yeah, again, I'm not trying to be a jerk.
00:55:47.48 --> 00:55:48.84 No, I'm having fun with it.
00:55:48.84 --> 00:55:49.68 Yeah, absolutely.
00:55:49.68 --> 00:55:52.48 But you're so pissed.
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:53.32 So pissed.
00:55:53.32 --> 00:55:54.92 You've got freaking tears in your eyes.
00:55:54.92 --> 00:55:55.76 Yeah.
00:55:55.76 --> 00:55:59.20 And you go to John, you fucking, you want this job or not,
00:55:59.20 --> 00:56:02.48 because if you say no, you're not talking to me,
00:56:02.48 --> 00:56:06.76 you do not have a job and you've got a new house.
00:56:06.76 --> 00:56:08.44 Okay, so he had, he's in the car.
00:56:08.44 --> 00:56:09.28 Okay.
00:56:09.28 --> 00:56:11.84 One down, one in the game.
00:56:11.84 --> 00:56:13.04 Still one in the game.
00:56:13.04 --> 00:56:13.88 Got it.
00:56:13.88 --> 00:56:16.92 As I drove to the other's houses,
00:56:16.92 --> 00:56:19.92 they either didn't answer the door and hid
00:56:19.92 --> 00:56:21.92 or answer the door and said, I can't talk to you
00:56:21.92 --> 00:56:22.76 and close to it.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.96 Okay, so our kids, you know,
00:56:25.96 --> 00:56:26.80 these are kids.
00:56:26.80 --> 00:56:27.64 These are kids.
00:56:27.64 --> 00:56:30.04 Which is a message to everybody.
00:56:30.04 --> 00:56:30.88 Yeah.
00:56:30.88 --> 00:56:33.28 When you don't want to talk to somebody,
00:56:33.28 --> 00:56:34.84 you're not solving anything.
00:56:34.84 --> 00:56:35.68 You don't know what I mean?
00:56:35.68 --> 00:56:36.52 You know what I mean?
00:56:36.52 --> 00:56:37.36 Yeah.
00:56:37.36 --> 00:56:38.44 Now, I'm not saying that there's sometimes
00:56:38.44 --> 00:56:40.60 where I'm so mad at you that I'm like,
00:56:40.60 --> 00:56:42.76 Pete, come back tomorrow, bro,
00:56:42.76 --> 00:56:43.56 because right now,
00:56:43.56 --> 00:56:44.40 anything that goes good?
00:56:44.40 --> 00:56:45.24 Yeah, is that?
00:56:45.24 --> 00:56:45.92 I'm so mad I could cry.
00:56:45.92 --> 00:56:46.76 Yeah.
00:56:46.76 --> 00:56:47.76 I was something like that.
00:56:47.76 --> 00:56:49.56 That sounds really sensitive.
00:56:49.56 --> 00:56:51.000 That would you actually do that?
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 That is a week.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.08 But that is that the point is though,
00:56:55.08 --> 00:56:57.76 seriously, if there's, if there's a problem
00:56:57.76 --> 00:56:59.32 and you're not going to talk about it,
00:56:59.32 --> 00:57:01.08 you're going to sound like that kid right there,
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:02.000 that answers the way I came up.
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.84 I can't talk to you right now.
00:57:02.84 --> 00:57:03.92 I can shut the door.
00:57:03.92 --> 00:57:06.16 That's that's not a way to get anything solved.
00:57:06.16 --> 00:57:07.88 Are there times where you need a little bit of distance?
00:57:07.88 --> 00:57:08.24 Yeah.
00:57:08.24 --> 00:57:09.24 Because people are hotheaded.
00:57:09.24 --> 00:57:10.24 Yes, that happens.
00:57:10.24 --> 00:57:11.44 As long as you know,
00:57:11.44 --> 00:57:12.68 you're going to,
00:57:12.68 --> 00:57:14.56 you both know that it's not,
00:57:14.56 --> 00:57:15.68 it's solvable,
00:57:15.68 --> 00:57:17.80 you know, like I feel like
00:57:17.80 --> 00:57:20.40 with respect to business and stuff.
00:57:20.40 --> 00:57:22.48 Like, like if you're working with a client,
00:57:22.48 --> 00:57:24.84 you may like bang heads with a client.
00:57:24.84 --> 00:57:25.68 And be like, all right, listen,
00:57:25.68 --> 00:57:27.84 we need to shut this down
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:30.24 and discuss it like in 48 hours.
00:57:31.12 --> 00:57:33.48 That's learned over time.
00:57:33.48 --> 00:57:34.56 Not when you're a kid.
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:36.16 You just want to get after like,
00:57:36.16 --> 00:57:39.48 for even your approach was super hardcore.
00:57:39.48 --> 00:57:41.08 And this is again,
00:57:41.08 --> 00:57:42.68 you know, people a little bit aggressive.
00:57:42.68 --> 00:57:45.32 Yeah, people, people want to hear me say like,
00:57:45.32 --> 00:57:46.16 that's right.
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:48.28 You go in there and you say you either talk to me now
00:57:48.28 --> 00:57:49.84 or you don't have a job.
00:57:49.84 --> 00:57:50.68 Yeah.
00:57:50.68 --> 00:57:51.68 I was already bleeding though.
00:57:51.68 --> 00:57:53.08 So was that the right choice?
00:57:54.08 --> 00:57:56.84 I don't know, but the approach for me would be like,
00:57:56.84 --> 00:58:00.000 hey, let me explain to you what's going on.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.44 And then you can think more about your decision
00:58:03.44 --> 00:58:06.28 because right now I'm telling you what you've decided
00:58:06.28 --> 00:58:08.96 and what you've presented to me is so far off base
00:58:08.96 --> 00:58:11.88 that if this is what you want to make your decision based on,
00:58:11.88 --> 00:58:13.84 I'm telling you what I'm going to have to do
00:58:13.84 --> 00:58:15.24 is let you go.
00:58:15.24 --> 00:58:16.80 Yeah, because I haven't told you yet,
00:58:16.80 --> 00:58:18.04 but we don't have any money.
00:58:18.04 --> 00:58:20.000 And I'm paying you out of my own pocket.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.88 So if you don't like that and you don't want me
00:58:21.88 --> 00:58:23.68 to pay you out of my own pocket or any more,
00:58:23.68 --> 00:58:25.56 I'm actually good with that.
00:58:25.56 --> 00:58:26.88 But if you want to have a job and you want to try
00:58:26.88 --> 00:58:29.08 and make this thing work, let's have a conversation.
00:58:29.08 --> 00:58:32.28 And that's close to exactly what I would say now.
00:58:32.28 --> 00:58:33.52 Yeah, exactly.
00:58:33.52 --> 00:58:34.36 100%.
00:58:34.36 --> 00:58:36.56 The reason I'm making this point is that I had a guy
00:58:36.56 --> 00:58:37.72 hit me up on social media.
00:58:37.72 --> 00:58:38.56 Yeah.
00:58:38.56 --> 00:58:39.40 He asked a legit question.
00:58:39.40 --> 00:58:41.20 And he pre-prefaced the question.
00:58:41.20 --> 00:58:45.000 He says, I'm a very direct guy like you.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000 Meaning he's direct like me.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.64 And he says, and I give feedback and it makes people mad
00:58:50.64 --> 00:58:53.04 and rub them the wrong way.
00:58:53.04 --> 00:58:55.40 And I'm just, you know, I wrote back a good look, man.
00:58:55.40 --> 00:59:00.04 I'm direct on Twitter, which is 140 characters.
00:59:00.04 --> 00:59:05.76 And I'm answering 720 questions in rapid fire.
00:59:05.76 --> 00:59:07.88 And so yeah, I'm direct when someone says,
00:59:07.88 --> 00:59:12.44 what is your average daily diet consist of?
00:59:12.44 --> 00:59:12.96 Steak.
00:59:12.96 --> 00:59:13.80 Next one.
00:59:13.80 --> 00:59:14.64 You know what I mean?
00:59:14.64 --> 00:59:16.36 Yeah, but you're direct you're not an asshole.
00:59:16.36 --> 00:59:19.16 But that's also like I'm having fun.
00:59:19.16 --> 00:59:22.32 Like that's the fun part of, you know, interacting
00:59:22.32 --> 00:59:24.20 with people through social media.
00:59:24.20 --> 00:59:27.44 That's not how I'm treating another human being face-to-face
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:29.04 in a real relationship when we're trying to build something.
00:59:29.04 --> 00:59:31.64 Then I'm using tact, I'm using maneuvering.
00:59:31.64 --> 00:59:32.48 Of course.
00:59:32.48 --> 00:59:34.48 But nitpulating the situation, I'm setting things up.
00:59:34.48 --> 00:59:36.20 I'm being the most tactful person.
00:59:36.20 --> 00:59:39.44 In fact, not only am I not gonna rub them the wrong way,
00:59:39.44 --> 00:59:41.60 I'm gonna rub them in a very nice way.
00:59:41.60 --> 00:59:44.16 So they feel good about the conversation that we had.
00:59:44.16 --> 00:59:46.56 Disarmum and how real things are actually.
00:59:46.56 --> 00:59:50.56 The point is is that, you know, you're, you, like you said,
00:59:50.56 --> 00:59:54.76 what my little quote was is what you would say now.
00:59:54.76 --> 00:59:57.44 Back then, you're young, you're bleeding.
00:59:57.44 --> 00:59:58.44 I'm bleeding.
00:59:58.44 --> 00:59:59.24 You pissed off.
00:59:59.24 --> 00:59:59.92 Yeah.
00:59:59.92 --> 01:00:02.96 And you say, you know, wife nagging at me about finances.
01:00:02.96 --> 01:00:04.68 Yeah, you know how that all builds.
01:00:04.68 --> 01:00:07.52 Two young kids don't sleep through the night.
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:12.52 You know, it gets tricky and you're trying to maintain this.
01:00:12.52 --> 01:00:16.96 So just FYI, what you just said, you just said,
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:18.20 you know how it is.
01:00:18.20 --> 01:00:20.12 And to be honest with you, I don't know how that is.
01:00:20.12 --> 01:00:21.80 Because I was in the military.
01:00:21.80 --> 01:00:23.44 I got to pay it check every two weeks.
01:00:23.44 --> 01:00:24.28 I had kids.
01:00:24.28 --> 01:00:25.64 I had health insurance taken care of.
01:00:25.64 --> 01:00:27.08 I had house taken care of.
01:00:27.08 --> 01:00:33.08 It's, it's a huge, it's, it's, it's actually a feeling I don't know.
01:00:33.08 --> 01:00:35.60 So I, yeah, don't know that feeling.
01:00:35.60 --> 01:00:41.40 I can only imagine, I can only imagine what I would be thinking
01:00:41.40 --> 01:00:46.36 if I was in your shoes at 22 years old with a wife to screaming kids.
01:00:46.36 --> 01:00:48.24 And I don't have any money.
01:00:48.24 --> 01:00:50.28 So yeah, check.
01:00:50.28 --> 01:00:51.28 OK.
01:00:51.28 --> 01:00:52.08 And I get some.
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:54.16 I will tell you about that feeling.
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:57.28 It's a feeling I'm never going to go back to.
01:00:57.28 --> 01:01:02.48 As we, as I divided and conquered, it did not go my way.
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:09.12 So meaning that the people were saying they can't talk
01:01:09.12 --> 01:01:09.72 or they hit.
01:01:09.72 --> 01:01:10.16 They can't talk.
01:01:10.16 --> 01:01:11.16 They went, they laughed.
01:01:11.16 --> 01:01:15.52 They're having their homes, whatever.
01:01:15.52 --> 01:01:17.20 So I made a decision what to do.
01:01:17.20 --> 01:01:21.20 When I told, talk to my wife, she's like, what are we going to do?
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:28.28 I said, well, I said they all think they're expendable, accept.
01:01:28.28 --> 01:01:34.48 They're not because there's not a person in this world that is so good.
01:01:34.48 --> 01:01:36.48 Oh, they can't be replaced.
01:01:36.48 --> 01:01:37.48 They can't be replaced.
01:01:37.48 --> 01:01:38.48 You got it.
01:01:38.48 --> 01:01:40.36 They're not expendable.
01:01:40.36 --> 01:01:43.04 There's not a person's world that is so good at their job.
01:01:43.04 --> 01:01:45.16 They can't be replaced.
01:01:45.16 --> 01:01:46.16 Do you hear that echo?
01:01:46.16 --> 01:01:47.16 Yes.
01:01:47.16 --> 01:01:48.16 Just to say.
01:01:48.16 --> 01:01:50.16 Almost none.
01:01:50.16 --> 01:01:51.16 But you're right.
01:01:51.16 --> 01:01:55.52 There's a lot of talent that people in the world.
01:01:55.52 --> 01:01:57.48 So what did I do?
01:01:57.48 --> 01:02:00.32 hefty trash bags.
01:02:00.32 --> 01:02:02.32 Get some.
01:02:02.32 --> 01:02:08.20 I went up to that studio and I scraped their desks individually into trash bags.
01:02:08.20 --> 01:02:10.28 I didn't even think it felt good.
01:02:10.28 --> 01:02:13.48 I didn't even mean to say that like, but it felt good.
01:02:13.48 --> 01:02:14.48 Yeah.
01:02:14.48 --> 01:02:18.44 I literally scraped it, tied it up.
01:02:18.44 --> 01:02:19.44 Went to the next one.
01:02:19.44 --> 01:02:22.88 My wife just pushed it all into the bag.
01:02:22.88 --> 01:02:24.44 This was good.
01:02:24.44 --> 01:02:25.44 Derpy.
01:02:25.44 --> 01:02:26.44 Yep.
01:02:26.44 --> 01:02:27.44 We dragged all the shot.
01:02:27.44 --> 01:02:29.96 I don't care what they had on their desks.
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:32.60 My property.
01:02:32.60 --> 01:02:36.20 Your shit in the trash bags.
01:02:36.20 --> 01:02:39.04 And organized nothing is scraped.
01:02:39.04 --> 01:02:41.44 Drag them down the stairs.
01:02:41.44 --> 01:02:42.44 Gently.
01:02:42.44 --> 01:02:45.44 Because I'm getting a feeling this was not a drag.
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:46.84 Them down the stairs.
01:02:46.84 --> 01:02:53.92 We were in this studio, you know, third floor studio that we had built out for us.
01:02:53.92 --> 01:02:54.92 Beautiful.
01:02:54.92 --> 01:02:57.92 Right.
01:02:57.92 --> 01:03:03.64 That Monday morning, the art director who I cut my teeth with came down.
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:05.80 He lived in Bangor, Maine.
01:03:05.80 --> 01:03:12.28 He said Bangor came down and we were sitting there and it was glass, like the glass.
01:03:12.28 --> 01:03:18.80 And it's like you can see through it being inside, but from the outside you can't.
01:03:18.80 --> 01:03:22.92 They all get out of the same vehicle kind of giggling and chuckling.
01:03:22.92 --> 01:03:24.16 They own me.
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:26.52 They own this company.
01:03:26.52 --> 01:03:30.84 And they walked in the door and then we were sitting there with a trash bags.
01:03:30.84 --> 01:03:35.56 And they went from.
01:03:35.56 --> 01:03:43.64 He was in the city to guilty, to sadness, and their faces turned white.
01:03:43.64 --> 01:03:45.26 There's your shit.
01:03:45.26 --> 01:03:48.60 Take it.
01:03:48.60 --> 01:03:50.24 Now's it?
01:03:50.24 --> 01:03:51.40 Done.
01:03:51.40 --> 01:03:52.72 That was tough.
01:03:52.72 --> 01:04:00.40 I said a few words.
01:04:00.40 --> 01:04:05.40 I was not going to be held hostage to this situation.
01:04:09.40 --> 01:04:14.40 In business, I say you've got like 40 years of being a maker.
01:04:14.40 --> 01:04:17.40 I did a speech recently at an innovation.
01:04:17.40 --> 01:04:20.40 I wrote a speech for an innovation expo.
01:04:20.40 --> 01:04:25.40 You know, zero to 20 year learning, 20 to 60 year doing
01:04:25.40 --> 01:04:30.40 and 60 to 80, hopefully you're enjoying the fruits of your labor.
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:33.40 Anything good in life takes 10 years.
01:04:33.40 --> 01:04:38.40 So my first 10 years had passed, but I still had 30 to go.
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:41.40 And so I knew I wasn't done,
01:04:41.40 --> 01:04:47.40 but the pain of the situation in the experience
01:04:47.40 --> 01:04:50.40 I grew exponentially overnight.
01:04:50.40 --> 01:04:56.40 We had salvaged a small part of the company,
01:04:56.40 --> 01:05:00.40 which was this webware.
01:05:00.40 --> 01:05:02.40 It was like online software.
01:05:02.40 --> 01:05:04.40 Everything is now, like the cloud.
01:05:04.40 --> 01:05:06.40 But there was no cloud.
01:05:06.40 --> 01:05:08.40 There was this system.
01:05:08.40 --> 01:05:13.40 I was able to salvage that because it had a cool little customer base
01:05:13.40 --> 01:05:14.40 of some high-end customers.
01:05:14.40 --> 01:05:15.40 They paid monthly.
01:05:15.40 --> 01:05:17.40 It was just like reoccurring payments,
01:05:17.40 --> 01:05:22.40 just to use it.
01:05:22.40 --> 01:05:25.40 And so I found a buyer for it
01:05:25.40 --> 01:05:29.40 and the negotiation took a long time.
01:05:29.40 --> 01:05:32.40 And in that long time we had no income,
01:05:32.40 --> 01:05:33.40 no money.
01:05:33.40 --> 01:05:35.40 And so what did I do?
01:05:35.40 --> 01:05:38.40 I started selling shit, dirt bikes,
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:41.40 four wheelers, snowmobiles.
01:05:41.40 --> 01:05:46.40 Every non-essential item I owned got sold.
01:05:46.40 --> 01:05:50.40 I was trying to maintain keeping my home,
01:05:50.40 --> 01:05:55.40 which we had built my wife and I in the forest,
01:05:55.40 --> 01:05:57.40 which was our dream home,
01:05:57.40 --> 01:06:01.40 just a tiny little 1500 square foot timber frame.
01:06:01.40 --> 01:06:07.40 Borrowing money from family and in our parents.
01:06:07.40 --> 01:06:10.40 And then knowing the situation where and so,
01:06:10.40 --> 01:06:15.40 them actually just like giving us food or whatever.
01:06:15.40 --> 01:06:19.40 That whole time I had the maintain like this super composure
01:06:19.40 --> 01:06:22.40 to try and sell this thing.
01:06:22.40 --> 01:06:26.40 All this shit happening in the background.
01:06:26.40 --> 01:06:29.40 And I think it was like eight months.
01:06:29.40 --> 01:06:31.40 And I finally sold it.
01:06:31.40 --> 01:06:34.40 200,000 dollars I think it was.
01:06:34.40 --> 01:06:42.40 Which was cheap for what we had built.
01:06:42.40 --> 01:06:45.40 Extremely cheap.
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:50.40 But I was in a position where we had nothing left.
01:06:50.40 --> 01:06:53.40 Had freaking nothing left.
01:06:53.40 --> 01:06:57.40 You know.
01:06:57.40 --> 01:07:00.40 It was super, super challenging.
01:07:00.40 --> 01:07:04.40 And I could have easily turned to substance abuse,
01:07:04.40 --> 01:07:08.40 which I never been into substances.
01:07:08.40 --> 01:07:12.40 I could have easily just fell off the deep end
01:07:12.40 --> 01:07:14.40 and felt like a failure,
01:07:14.40 --> 01:07:19.40 which I knew I wasn't.
01:07:19.40 --> 01:07:21.40 My wife wanted me to go find a job.
01:07:21.40 --> 01:07:23.40 She's like, that's what I was about to say.
01:07:23.40 --> 01:07:24.40 I can't do this normal.
01:07:24.40 --> 01:07:26.40 You go get it 95.
01:07:26.40 --> 01:07:28.40 Actually I can't do this.
01:07:28.40 --> 01:07:29.40 I can't do this, Pete.
01:07:29.40 --> 01:07:31.40 I can't do this.
01:07:31.40 --> 01:07:33.40 During that eight months,
01:07:33.40 --> 01:07:35.40 you've got to figure something I said,
01:07:35.40 --> 01:07:39.40 I'm not going to be a team.
01:07:39.40 --> 01:07:43.40 I will find a way to make this work.
01:07:43.40 --> 01:07:47.40 And I believe everything happens for a reason.
01:07:47.40 --> 01:07:49.40 It happened for a reason.
01:07:49.40 --> 01:07:52.40 And I just kept that in the back of my head.
01:07:52.40 --> 01:07:56.40 And I pushed and pushed forward.
01:07:56.40 --> 01:07:58.40 And it wasn't freaking easy.
01:07:58.40 --> 01:08:00.40 Like it was super, super hard.
01:08:00.40 --> 01:08:02.40 Like on us.
01:08:02.40 --> 01:08:07.40 But she stood by me.
01:08:07.40 --> 01:08:09.40 Unwavering.
01:08:09.40 --> 01:08:12.40 She stood by me.
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:15.40 Never once did she want to leave.
01:08:15.40 --> 01:08:20.40 Did she.
01:08:20.40 --> 01:08:23.40 Not believe in me.
01:08:23.40 --> 01:08:28.40 Or not trust me, which is what I needed.
01:08:28.40 --> 01:08:32.40 And like I said earlier about filling the glass back up.
01:08:32.40 --> 01:08:33.40 It was empty.
01:08:33.40 --> 01:08:36.40 It was bone, freaking dry.
01:08:36.40 --> 01:08:37.40 Bone dry.
01:08:37.40 --> 01:08:40.40 And she just put a little bit back in.
01:08:40.40 --> 01:08:43.40 And we kept moving and kept chugging.
01:08:43.40 --> 01:08:47.40 Now during that time period where you're looking to sell
01:08:47.40 --> 01:08:49.40 the old company.
01:08:49.40 --> 01:08:52.40 Are you hatching plans?
01:08:52.40 --> 01:08:55.40 Or is you got to be 100% focused on just selling my stuff on my
01:08:55.40 --> 01:08:58.40 fresh coastery with getting these pools back five hours
01:08:58.40 --> 01:09:01.40 in completelylege.
01:09:01.40 --> 01:09:08.90 And it's always just that problems called your
01:09:08.90 --> 01:09:11.40 own heart,시간ion.
01:09:11.40 --> 01:09:11.40 I wanted to say that it gateway and company,
01:09:11.40 --> 01:09:15.40 so it obviously did thing that'd really have
01:09:15.40 --> 01:09:18.08 gotten using this contract before it took for me to
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:20.28 get a lot of money to sign up for that contract.
01:09:20.28 --> 01:09:23.40 But it never spent money out of accounting for me.
01:09:23.40 --> 01:09:28.52 a negative thought, I would just push through it, I just pushed through the thought and
01:09:28.52 --> 01:09:36.08 what got me through a lot of that was training GJ2 where I could expel my energy and use
01:09:36.08 --> 01:09:39.28 my creativity which I thought I had lost in GJ2.
01:09:39.28 --> 01:09:49.48 It's a very creative sport art and that kind of kept me, I guess I kept those endorphins
01:09:49.48 --> 01:09:54.92 flowing so I could maintain some stability.
01:09:54.92 --> 01:09:57.92 But tactically, your focus is sell.
01:09:57.92 --> 01:10:00.52 It's got to make it look good.
01:10:00.52 --> 01:10:04.08 Let's show them the numbers that are coming in for our few clients and what the projections
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:05.08 could be.
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:06.08 That's all you're doing.
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:07.08 That's all you're doing.
01:10:07.08 --> 01:10:10.60 And you're thinking when you sell that thing, you're going to have enough and you'll
01:10:10.60 --> 01:10:12.72 figure it out later which I'm not worried about right now.
01:10:12.72 --> 01:10:13.72 Exactly.
01:10:13.72 --> 01:10:16.08 So, you make the sale.
01:10:16.08 --> 01:10:20.40 I made the sale for the first year we get a monthly check.
01:10:20.40 --> 01:10:24.48 It's like five grand a month or something.
01:10:24.48 --> 01:10:28.40 Not the full amount, just like five grand a month.
01:10:28.40 --> 01:10:36.84 So during that time I decided to just take 12 months and figure out what comes next.
01:10:36.84 --> 01:10:44.000 And in that 12 months I traveled around the country, training GJ2 and filming a thing
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.96 we call BJJ weekly because that's what I was passionate about.
01:10:48.96 --> 01:10:53.24 And so we traveled around and filmed technique and trained and all this stuff.
01:10:53.24 --> 01:10:56.68 And it was like an excuse to train GJ2.
01:10:56.68 --> 01:10:57.68 That's it.
01:10:57.68 --> 01:10:59.28 This newsletter.
01:10:59.28 --> 01:11:07.96 And after that 12 months and traveling around it just struck me what I wanted to do.
01:11:07.96 --> 01:11:14.20 Years earlier I had designed this logo for a G-brand.
01:11:14.20 --> 01:11:18.12 Off the cuff came to me, I get my ideas in the morning.
01:11:18.12 --> 01:11:24.08 One morning I sat down and just boom done five minutes.
01:11:24.08 --> 01:11:29.12 Sometimes you can have a client come in, we used to and I spent a hundred hours on the
01:11:29.12 --> 01:11:31.32 frid and logo.
01:11:31.32 --> 01:11:33.40 People don't realize how much logo is cost.
01:11:33.40 --> 01:11:37.44 And sometimes you just nail it like ten minutes done finished.
01:11:37.44 --> 01:11:41.12 Just like getting hit by lightning just boom done.
01:11:41.12 --> 01:11:45.36 And that's what happened with this origin thing.
01:11:45.36 --> 01:11:49.76 I wanted to start a brand because what I had done and what I had learned and over that
01:11:49.76 --> 01:11:59.88 year of driving around and training and reconnecting with myself and my family was that
01:11:59.88 --> 01:12:05.84 I loved building brands and products.
01:12:05.84 --> 01:12:13.44 I loved taking something from nothing like a drawing and making it into something.
01:12:13.44 --> 01:12:22.000 And I had an aversion to the screen and that space because of the new media thing.
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.32 I was always on a screen and I told the man I need to like do something physically,
01:12:30.32 --> 01:12:31.92 like have something physical.
01:12:31.92 --> 01:12:37.60 I need to have a physical thing to do because I was an art major and I'm an artist and
01:12:37.60 --> 01:12:39.68 I zip up goal posts.
01:12:39.68 --> 01:12:42.16 I need a thing to do so.
01:12:42.16 --> 01:12:46.48 In Gigi Tu, I had seen that the uniform like hadn't changed.
01:12:46.48 --> 01:12:47.48 I don't know.
01:12:47.48 --> 01:12:49.84 They've been wearing kimonos for a thousand years.
01:12:49.84 --> 01:12:55.36 But you know, judo, you know, hundreds of years, Gigi Tu, a hundred years and Brazil,
01:12:55.36 --> 01:12:59.32 same thing, same thing, same thing, 100% cotton uniform.
01:12:59.32 --> 01:13:03.32 This is what you wear.
01:13:03.32 --> 01:13:08.84 You got under armor with like wicking stuff and you've got air helmets instead of leather
01:13:08.84 --> 01:13:14.44 helmets and you know, just all these innovations and other sports and judo had shit.
01:13:14.44 --> 01:13:15.44 We had nothing.
01:13:15.44 --> 01:13:21.24 Like wearing a bunch of just straight cotton balls and you know, sweaty, soaked in Gigi,
01:13:21.24 --> 01:13:24.96 that stretches and stinks bad.
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:26.96 It sucked.
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:31.000 So to start, I was like, okay, I got to start.
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.44 Meaning you now the vision.
01:13:34.44 --> 01:13:36.92 You see that Gigi's haven't progressed.
01:13:36.92 --> 01:13:40.08 You know that they can be made better.
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:44.36 But you don't actually answer, you say, okay, I want to make the best Gigi in the world.
01:13:44.36 --> 01:13:45.68 Yeah, that's the vision.
01:13:45.68 --> 01:13:47.04 Yes, it is.
01:13:47.04 --> 01:13:48.52 And you have to start somewhere.
01:13:48.52 --> 01:13:49.68 You got to start somewhere.
01:13:49.68 --> 01:13:55.80 So I didn't know anything about textiles, but I knew about design and I knew about the human
01:13:55.80 --> 01:13:59.88 body and you know, how the human body worked.
01:13:59.88 --> 01:14:04.20 And in college sports, you learned about that a lot, you know, mechanics, mechanics of the
01:14:04.20 --> 01:14:07.76 body and they, they retrain you how to run in college.
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:09.40 Like they you all run the same.
01:14:09.40 --> 01:14:10.40 You do exercises.
01:14:10.40 --> 01:14:12.48 So you're all striking forage striking with your foot.
01:14:12.48 --> 01:14:15.24 You all run the same.
01:14:15.24 --> 01:14:18.92 And so I designed like a G-pan, so it was like the cowboy cut.
01:14:18.92 --> 01:14:23.92 Because I knew that in Gigi too when you're like you're squatting a lot and underneath
01:14:23.92 --> 01:14:28.96 and the material pulled up your leg, but pulled down your butt.
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:34.24 So you're like, got plumbers crack, which sucks.
01:14:34.24 --> 01:14:37.24 So I designed like so the knee pads came up to your hip.
01:14:37.24 --> 01:14:40.24 So when you squat it, it would pull from your hips, right?
01:14:40.24 --> 01:14:43.40 Instead of a cross to the top of your leg.
01:14:43.40 --> 01:14:45.44 And did some cool innovations like that.
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:48.32 And then I was like, all right, time to go.
01:14:48.32 --> 01:14:53.80 So we launched a Gigi at, we imported the ski from Pakistan.
01:14:53.80 --> 01:15:00.12 And I was in the basement of my house.
01:15:00.12 --> 01:15:01.56 And I was like, we're going to start this brand.
01:15:01.56 --> 01:15:06.20 So I hit the basement sucked.
01:15:06.20 --> 01:15:07.20 Here comes the key.
01:15:07.20 --> 01:15:08.20 We shot a photo.
01:15:08.20 --> 01:15:14.56 We saw some photos off it and I launched it through BTAJ weekly and boom, 40 grand.
01:15:14.56 --> 01:15:18.88 I was like, wow, which you didn't have any Gis.
01:15:18.88 --> 01:15:19.88 No.
01:15:19.88 --> 01:15:28.20 No Gis, but I wanted to prove that we could do something different.
01:15:28.20 --> 01:15:30.68 And I trusted I could make it happen.
01:15:30.68 --> 01:15:32.20 No way, having a Gis.
01:15:32.20 --> 01:15:36.32 There's like 200 Gis sold.
01:15:36.32 --> 01:15:37.32 I've got something here.
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:42.52 I've got something good here.
01:15:42.52 --> 01:15:45.80 And I knew a new adventure was going to start.
01:15:45.80 --> 01:15:49.000 And my wife spun up.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Was it in a positive way?
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000 No.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.20 Oh.
01:15:54.20 --> 01:15:57.32 She just like, what are you doing?
01:15:57.32 --> 01:16:00.84 I'm like I'm starting a Gieberhand.
01:16:00.84 --> 01:16:02.76 And she like got sick.
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:04.76 Like I don't know, she might have an anxiety attack.
01:16:04.76 --> 01:16:08.56 And that first, like you can't do this again.
01:16:08.56 --> 01:16:11.04 You can't, you can't start another company.
01:16:11.04 --> 01:16:13.68 It's like, just.
01:16:13.68 --> 01:16:20.52 And I used this word lightly being around a war hero like you, which is no war hero here.
01:16:20.52 --> 01:16:21.52 I promise you that.
01:16:21.52 --> 01:16:24.72 PTSD of business.
01:16:24.72 --> 01:16:27.12 That's a real thing.
01:16:27.12 --> 01:16:33.24 Like she had like PTSD of business because of what we had gone through and selling everything
01:16:33.24 --> 01:16:38.56 in the feeling you get, that you keep this feeling.
01:16:38.56 --> 01:16:44.64 For me, I used it for drive, for her, she used it for, I don't ever want to feel that
01:16:44.64 --> 01:16:46.000 again.
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.92 That makes me like ill.
01:16:48.92 --> 01:16:51.84 For me, it was like, I'm never going to feel that again.
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:54.72 I'm going to make sure I never feel that again.
01:16:54.72 --> 01:16:56.24 And I'm going to do something about it.
01:16:56.24 --> 01:16:59.68 So I did it anyway.
01:16:59.68 --> 01:17:02.28 Started a company, origin.
01:17:02.28 --> 01:17:08.24 And that's when it began 2011.
01:17:08.24 --> 01:17:13.000 So how do you start it?
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.48 So you got one key.
01:17:14.48 --> 01:17:18.72 Well, you sold 40 grand worth of one key that you didn't have.
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:20.72 What's what did you do next?
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:22.96 Did you know at this point you wanted to make them in America?
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:23.96 Had you figured that part out?
01:17:23.96 --> 01:17:24.96 No, no.
01:17:24.96 --> 01:17:27.96 I, let me take that.
01:17:27.96 --> 01:17:28.96 Or you figured you'd make them in America.
01:17:28.96 --> 01:17:31.24 I wanted to make them in America.
01:17:31.24 --> 01:17:36.84 And so I started like calling all the factories and in Maine.
01:17:36.84 --> 01:17:38.72 Hey, you know, you guys so stuff.
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:39.72 Yeah, cool.
01:17:39.72 --> 01:17:40.72 Can you sew this?
01:17:40.72 --> 01:17:41.72 No.
01:17:41.72 --> 01:17:42.72 Okay.
01:17:42.72 --> 01:17:49.32 So we don't know Maine has traditionally had a lot of industry up here, manufacturing.
01:17:49.32 --> 01:17:50.32 Big time.
01:17:50.32 --> 01:17:55.52 Especially when we were kids, big brands up here that build a lot.
01:17:55.52 --> 01:17:56.80 They're all kinds of stuff.
01:17:56.80 --> 01:17:59.16 Bass shoe 10 minutes away.
01:17:59.16 --> 01:18:00.16 Sold out.
01:18:00.16 --> 01:18:02.96 Dexter shoe, Hayden shoe, Lou Hayden.
01:18:02.96 --> 01:18:05.52 You don't say it until you shoot past away.
01:18:05.52 --> 01:18:08.12 And huge companies, L.O.B.
01:18:08.12 --> 01:18:12.16 New Balance 20 minutes away.
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:16.36 So rich heritage and manufacturing.
01:18:16.36 --> 01:18:18.84 But a peril in Maine.
01:18:18.84 --> 01:18:19.84 A little different.
01:18:19.84 --> 01:18:23.36 We made shoes and we wolf fabric and stuff like that.
01:18:23.36 --> 01:18:25.52 But a peril wasn't the norm.
01:18:25.52 --> 01:18:30.08 So what I did is we were in that basement and we're like, okay.
01:18:30.08 --> 01:18:33.64 And I just got to make this note that all those, a lot of those companies that you're talking
01:18:33.64 --> 01:18:35.08 about that had built all the stuff.
01:18:35.08 --> 01:18:37.92 And we're all those years, a lot of them had left.
01:18:37.92 --> 01:18:38.92 Yeah.
01:18:38.92 --> 01:18:43.72 So that's the, I, I, all of the situation except all of them had left.
01:18:43.72 --> 01:18:44.62 L.O.B.
01:18:44.62 --> 01:18:48.20 And they still make some stuff here.
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:50.20 The rest left gone.
01:18:50.20 --> 01:18:52.000 So you balance still make some stuff here too.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000 Yeah, new balance.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000 Oh yeah, for sure.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.48 Yeah, new balance is awesome.
01:18:56.48 --> 01:19:00.84 So I was like, okay.
01:19:00.84 --> 01:19:02.48 We're gonna make a belt.
01:19:02.48 --> 01:19:03.48 That's what we're gonna do.
01:19:03.48 --> 01:19:04.48 We're gonna make a belt.
01:19:04.48 --> 01:19:05.48 Did you do belt?
01:19:05.48 --> 01:19:06.48 Yeah.
01:19:06.48 --> 01:19:12.56 So there was this guy in Louis, then, who ran this company.
01:19:12.56 --> 01:19:15.84 And I called him up and like, I need some sewing machines.
01:19:15.84 --> 01:19:21.36 He's like, okay, well, why don't you stop by and Louis, then, Maine, one of the manufacturing
01:19:21.36 --> 01:19:25.000 hubs of Maine at one time, walked in and he's like, what do you need?
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.44 I was like, this is what I want to make.
01:19:27.44 --> 01:19:29.04 It's a belt for martial arts.
01:19:29.04 --> 01:19:30.04 He's like, okay.
01:19:30.04 --> 01:19:33.48 And I said, I just need some machine to do that.
01:19:33.48 --> 01:19:35.28 And like, I got 500 bucks cash.
01:19:35.28 --> 01:19:37.000 I can spend on it.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.92 Can you give me something to practice with?
01:19:40.92 --> 01:19:45.28 And so he sold me a machine, showed me how to thread the bob in.
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:47.24 Showed me where it went, pulled through the needle.
01:19:47.24 --> 01:19:50.36 And I'm like, okay, okay, we filmed it.
01:19:50.36 --> 01:19:51.96 So we knew how to do it.
01:19:51.96 --> 01:19:53.36 So we're like filming him doing this.
01:19:53.36 --> 01:19:56.60 And I'm like, okay, so we took the sewing machine and then I put it in my basement.
01:19:56.60 --> 01:19:58.48 Next to the desk and I'm like, yeah.
01:19:58.48 --> 01:20:01.000 That's so amazing.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.44 And my wife was just like, shaking her head.
01:20:06.44 --> 01:20:09.52 Luckily, luckily we had sold a pre-order.
01:20:09.52 --> 01:20:14.04 So we had sold $40,000 in Giz that didn't exist.
01:20:14.04 --> 01:20:18.92 So she had gotten off my back a little bit.
01:20:18.92 --> 01:20:20.92 So that machinery sat there.
01:20:20.92 --> 01:20:24.36 And as we looked at trying to make this key.
01:20:24.36 --> 01:20:26.16 And I didn't say, oh, we're going to make a key in America.
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:27.36 I just said, right, we're going to make a key.
01:20:27.36 --> 01:20:29.88 We're going to change the key.
01:20:29.88 --> 01:20:32.28 We're going to change the key first.
01:20:32.28 --> 01:20:36.20 So we started the import game.
01:20:36.20 --> 01:20:37.72 Everybody else is doing it.
01:20:37.72 --> 01:20:41.08 Everybody's telling me manufacturers dead.
01:20:41.08 --> 01:20:43.28 I did a few phone calls.
01:20:43.28 --> 01:20:46.48 Pretty much everybody's like, yeah, you can't really do that.
01:20:46.48 --> 01:20:51.64 And so I was like, okay, you know, at the whole time I'm thinking like, something's
01:20:51.64 --> 01:20:55.60 not right here that I can't do this.
01:20:55.60 --> 01:21:00.68 And I just couldn't put my finger on what it was.
01:21:00.68 --> 01:21:09.20 So I imported in 2011 and May we started in 2011 and into 2012.
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:10.88 Then a few batches did the whole.
01:21:10.88 --> 01:21:13.000 Hey, limited edition batch thing.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.76 Giz, but we promoted it with the innovations we had.
01:21:17.76 --> 01:21:19.76 It was still shit.
01:21:19.76 --> 01:21:21.16 When it comes right down to it.
01:21:21.16 --> 01:21:22.16 What the key was?
01:21:22.16 --> 01:21:23.16 Yeah, man.
01:21:23.16 --> 01:21:24.16 It was still shit.
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:26.16 I'm using old textiles.
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:27.16 I have to exist.
01:21:27.16 --> 01:21:31.88 So do you design, you said you imported one from Pakistan and then what do you do?
01:21:31.88 --> 01:21:35.28 Like, cut it up and redesign it or something or did you send the design to them?
01:21:35.28 --> 01:21:39.32 And they, so I designed like everything in a little straight.
01:21:39.32 --> 01:21:41.04 Like a tech like I want this here.
01:21:41.04 --> 01:21:42.04 I want the knee pads here.
01:21:42.04 --> 01:21:46.000 They've got a fall here, the belt loops because I don't want to untie the, all this
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000 stuff.
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000 And then they send it.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000 Yeah.
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000 Done.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000 Yeah.
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000 Finish.
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.88 So you know in Pakistan, they're like the manufacturing for martial arts.
01:21:57.88 --> 01:22:02.44 It's like the manufacturing hub and this little city called sale cut.
01:22:02.44 --> 01:22:06.56 They're actually like almost like migrant workers as a ton of factories, due to factories.
01:22:06.56 --> 01:22:08.64 But the workers are the same.
01:22:08.64 --> 01:22:10.64 Oh, the same guys in there.
01:22:10.64 --> 01:22:12.24 Yeah, all the same guys they made or whatever.
01:22:12.24 --> 01:22:13.24 They rotate around.
01:22:13.24 --> 01:22:14.24 Oh, yeah.
01:22:14.24 --> 01:22:15.24 Yeah.
01:22:15.24 --> 01:22:16.24 We got a contract over here.
01:22:16.24 --> 01:22:17.24 We're going to make five.
01:22:17.24 --> 01:22:18.24 Yeah, let's go make her Giz.
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:19.24 Yeah.
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:19.24 Good bunch of guys show up there.
01:22:19.24 --> 01:22:21.24 They work for pennies and pennies.
01:22:21.24 --> 01:22:21.92 Yep.
01:22:21.92 --> 01:22:27.000 We did the importing thing and we started to grow rapidly.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.16 We started to make money.
01:22:29.16 --> 01:22:34.96 And at that point, my other business, I was making kind of monthly income and then I got
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:37.12 kind of like a chunk of money like 100 grand.
01:22:37.12 --> 01:22:38.96 I was like, all right, cool.
01:22:38.96 --> 01:22:44.24 I can like take a deep breath and really push this thing.
01:22:44.24 --> 01:22:50.52 And so I pushed it and we started selling more and more.
01:22:50.52 --> 01:22:55.88 And I came out with this really cool backpack, called a Mondial backpack, Munjial backpack,
01:22:55.88 --> 01:22:56.88 technical backpack.
01:22:56.88 --> 01:22:59.48 And we sold a ton of them, thousands of them.
01:22:59.48 --> 01:23:02.64 And then we came out with this product for grip training.
01:23:02.64 --> 01:23:03.64 We weren't patting anything.
01:23:03.64 --> 01:23:05.60 We were just like, boom, because that's what I did.
01:23:05.60 --> 01:23:08.52 Once I got on the rolls, I was like, design this, design this.
01:23:08.52 --> 01:23:13.72 And we were just selling, selling, selling.
01:23:13.72 --> 01:23:16.40 And during this time, I was also competing.
01:23:16.40 --> 01:23:22.88 Now, because a mail, it's just a no more.
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:27.24 It's due to you and you want to test yourself against the best in the world.
01:23:27.24 --> 01:23:29.44 So I was training hard.
01:23:29.44 --> 01:23:34.96 I ended up winning the, let me, let me digress for a second.
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:39.64 I had seen another company release a product for grip training that looked exactly
01:23:39.64 --> 01:23:40.64 like ours.
01:23:40.64 --> 01:23:43.08 What was the product though?
01:23:43.08 --> 01:23:44.08 You're training one?
01:23:44.08 --> 01:23:45.52 Yes, called that a ring hang.
01:23:45.52 --> 01:23:50.52 So it's like the ghee and then calmer and the sleeve.
01:23:50.52 --> 01:23:52.04 Yeah, it was cool.
01:23:52.04 --> 01:23:54.16 It was awesome.
01:23:54.16 --> 01:23:58.44 And I was like, those bastards ripped us off.
01:23:58.44 --> 01:24:01.80 And I wasn't thinking my manufacturer or anything while I was like, man, another company
01:24:01.80 --> 01:24:02.80 ripped us off.
01:24:02.80 --> 01:24:05.84 I should have patented that, you know, blah, blah, blah.
01:24:05.84 --> 01:24:07.84 OK.
01:24:07.84 --> 01:24:09.12 So I was competing.
01:24:09.12 --> 01:24:10.56 I ended up going to Canada.
01:24:10.56 --> 01:24:11.88 I won the World Pro Trials.
01:24:11.88 --> 01:24:13.32 I was a brown belt at the time.
01:24:13.32 --> 01:24:16.84 One of the world pro trials in the Black belt division, because they, you know, they
01:24:16.84 --> 01:24:21.44 put the divisions together as, you know, for that was in 2012.
01:24:21.44 --> 01:24:23.68 Now they, I think they separated them now again.
01:24:23.68 --> 01:24:29.72 But so I got to go over to Abu Dhabi and compete in the World Pro.
01:24:29.72 --> 01:24:35.08 And as a brown belt in that Black belt division.
01:24:35.08 --> 01:24:36.76 I'm sitting there before my match.
01:24:36.76 --> 01:24:43.000 And I'm supposed to fight Shandji Habero and the quarterfinals of the open division.
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:51.16 And I, I, I, I, I'm going to say this.
01:24:51.16 --> 01:24:55.40 It was bad seating like the seating of the brackets was not good.
01:24:55.40 --> 01:24:56.40 OK.
01:24:56.40 --> 01:25:05.52 Um, like, I had in my bracket a guy from Brazil, JT Torres, a Shandji and maybe
01:25:05.52 --> 01:25:06.72 under a Galvan.
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:09.84 And so JT didn't want to fight.
01:25:09.84 --> 01:25:13.72 So he, so I fought the other kid from Brazil.
01:25:13.72 --> 01:25:17.08 And he was much smaller and I was athletic and good night.
01:25:17.08 --> 01:25:18.92 I ended up winning.
01:25:18.92 --> 01:25:22.48 And then JT just kind of like didn't want to fight.
01:25:22.48 --> 01:25:25.72 So then he coach me against Shandji and we had a war.
01:25:25.72 --> 01:25:26.72 Here's a good man.
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:29.92 I had it last couple of the second spaddives.
01:25:29.92 --> 01:25:31.92 Very close.
01:25:31.92 --> 01:25:36.20 The problem with the No Shandji is multiple times World Champion from the World.
01:25:36.20 --> 01:25:38.80 One of the best of all time, and JT too.
01:25:38.80 --> 01:25:40.48 Big time.
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:41.48 Awesome guy too.
01:25:41.48 --> 01:25:42.48 Awesome.
01:25:42.48 --> 01:25:43.48 Awesome guy.
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:45.56 So, but the seating was bad like Lafato was.
01:25:45.56 --> 01:25:47.80 And then it like, there was a couple other guys.
01:25:47.80 --> 01:25:51.28 I don't know, just, if my division could have been tougher and I would have gotten my
01:25:51.28 --> 01:25:52.72 ass kicked a lot earlier.
01:25:52.72 --> 01:25:53.72 OK.
01:25:53.72 --> 01:25:58.000 So, but we had a war and it was awesome.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.48 And maybe I would have won if I had worked harder.
01:26:02.48 --> 01:26:12.04 Maybe I would have won if that girl from Poland didn't walk by me right before the match
01:26:12.04 --> 01:26:17.48 with an origin Gion and a different logo on the back.
01:26:17.48 --> 01:26:20.24 And what was on your cut of a G.
01:26:20.24 --> 01:26:21.84 Like the G that you designed.
01:26:21.84 --> 01:26:22.84 Yeah.
01:26:22.84 --> 01:26:25.64 And you see a girl from Poland who's competitive competing.
01:26:25.64 --> 01:26:26.64 She walks by.
01:26:26.64 --> 01:26:31.40 Yeah, it was actually, it was the pit, the pants.
01:26:31.40 --> 01:26:32.40 Yeah.
01:26:32.40 --> 01:26:34.84 There's a logo, a different logo on the back.
01:26:34.84 --> 01:26:38.12 But our whole thing, your design, yeah, different logo.
01:26:38.12 --> 01:26:39.12 Yeah.
01:26:39.12 --> 01:26:44.48 I knew it was my manufacturer and then everything clicked.
01:26:44.48 --> 01:26:47.60 They ripped off the orang-hangryp trainers.
01:26:47.60 --> 01:26:48.60 OK.
01:26:48.60 --> 01:26:49.60 OK.
01:26:49.60 --> 01:26:51.20 But what am I to do?
01:26:51.20 --> 01:26:55.36 Because I'm locked into these guys now.
01:26:55.36 --> 01:26:57.72 So I had to strategize.
01:26:57.72 --> 01:27:02.32 So I went out and lost in the quarterfinals.
01:27:02.32 --> 01:27:08.92 Got on an airplane, worse freaking flight of my life.
01:27:08.92 --> 01:27:13.76 Because I'm an ADHD kid and I can't be stuck in a freaking seat for 14 hours.
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:17.28 That sucks.
01:27:17.28 --> 01:27:20.16 And on the ride back, I was talking to J.T.
01:27:20.16 --> 01:27:22.76 Who I'd become good friends with.
01:27:22.76 --> 01:27:24.88 He was kind of like in a tricky position in life.
01:27:24.88 --> 01:27:28.80 He was still with his instructor in Maryland.
01:27:28.80 --> 01:27:30.52 And just didn't know what to do.
01:27:30.52 --> 01:27:31.76 He wasn't progressing.
01:27:31.76 --> 01:27:34.56 And he was telling me, man, I've got to get,
01:27:34.56 --> 01:27:37.88 like, I have to do it full work out before I can actually
01:27:37.88 --> 01:27:40.56 train with the guys because he was so good.
01:27:40.56 --> 01:27:43.44 He just wasn't getting it.
01:27:43.44 --> 01:27:44.96 And you know the mecca of J.T.
01:27:44.96 --> 01:27:49.60 Who you know is California.
01:27:49.60 --> 01:27:51.60 I'll do this so far as to say San Diego.
01:27:51.60 --> 01:27:52.40 San Diego.
01:27:52.40 --> 01:27:53.000 That's where you went.
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.48 That's where you went.
01:27:54.48 --> 01:27:56.60 So he was figuring his whole thing out.
01:27:56.60 --> 01:27:57.60 So cal for sure.
01:27:57.60 --> 01:27:58.44 So cal.
01:27:58.44 --> 01:27:59.12 Yeah.
01:27:59.12 --> 01:28:01.28 He was figuring his whole thing out.
01:28:01.28 --> 01:28:03.68 And I was I'm thinking about it's like this,
01:28:03.68 --> 01:28:08.60 probably I'm like man, I think I'm going to build a factory.
01:28:08.60 --> 01:28:10.32 I'm wearing the airplane.
01:28:10.32 --> 01:28:13.68 I was like he's looking to be like, yeah,
01:28:13.68 --> 01:28:15.08 I want to build a factory.
01:28:15.08 --> 01:28:17.24 Screw this shit.
01:28:17.24 --> 01:28:18.32 This is bullshit.
01:28:18.32 --> 01:28:19.72 I said, I'm not competing anymore.
01:28:19.72 --> 01:28:21.08 I'm done.
01:28:21.08 --> 01:28:22.88 And all of a sudden he wanted to do his win the World Champion
01:28:22.88 --> 01:28:23.08 ship.
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:25.28 So we kind of like helped each other a little bit
01:28:25.28 --> 01:28:29.000 in that plane ride back, like kind of bouncing ideas
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.84 off each other.
01:28:30.84 --> 01:28:33.92 Decompression, decompression.
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:40.92 So I got back and I skyped my manufacturer.
01:28:42.20 --> 01:28:47.32 And I was like over skyped.
01:28:47.32 --> 01:28:49.64 Like this is bullshit.
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:53.44 You freaking, I didn't say that.
01:28:53.44 --> 01:28:58.28 So you fucking ripped off our intellectual property
01:28:58.28 --> 01:29:02.40 and sold it to other brands.
01:29:02.40 --> 01:29:05.48 And he said business is business.
01:29:06.68 --> 01:29:07.52 Dang.
01:29:07.52 --> 01:29:08.96 You ever have a defining moment in your life
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:11.76 where you just turn on and you're like,
01:29:11.76 --> 01:29:13.40 yep, done.
01:29:14.76 --> 01:29:17.28 I knew at that moment what we were going to do.
01:29:17.28 --> 01:29:20.36 Like it was clear.
01:29:20.36 --> 01:29:22.28 It became clear.
01:29:22.28 --> 01:29:24.04 And I knew the challenge in front of me
01:29:24.04 --> 01:29:25.48 and I knew it wasn't sane.
01:29:25.48 --> 01:29:27.16 And I knew it couldn't be done.
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:29.60 And I was like, it's happening.
01:29:29.60 --> 01:29:31.88 Props.
01:29:31.88 --> 01:29:40.36 So I got to tell you a little bit of what happened right
01:29:40.36 --> 01:29:41.000 after that.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.68 Right after that, I went out to the World Championships
01:29:44.68 --> 01:29:48.56 to compete because I had already signed up.
01:29:48.56 --> 01:29:51.04 And that was going to be my year.
01:29:51.04 --> 01:29:56.04 We were there and there was this brand there.
01:29:56.04 --> 01:29:59.68 And I walked up and I walked by and I did double take.
01:29:59.68 --> 01:30:02.68 I was like, what?
01:30:02.68 --> 01:30:03.88 And I looked for the right.
01:30:03.88 --> 01:30:07.68 And there's our Mundial technical backpack right there.
01:30:07.68 --> 01:30:09.48 But with friends.
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:11.72 With send their logo on it.
01:30:11.72 --> 01:30:18.72 I went up to the guy and I was like, dude, I said,
01:30:18.72 --> 01:30:21.92 got an original idea.
01:30:21.92 --> 01:30:25.28 And everybody there's a badass except for this guy who doesn't
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:26.68 do Gigi's youth.
01:30:26.68 --> 01:30:28.76 Who does nothing, right?
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:32.52 Just some chubby dude who wants to capitalize on the success
01:30:32.52 --> 01:30:36.40 of combat sports and Gigi's who's growth in California.
01:30:36.40 --> 01:30:38.40 And I'm not going to name the company.
01:30:38.40 --> 01:30:41.20 And I was like, that is a week.
01:30:41.20 --> 01:30:44.20 I said in bullshit.
01:30:44.20 --> 01:30:48.16 I said, get some original friggin' ideas.
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:51.92 I went down, walked down in myself and the deco
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:53.20 our business partner.
01:30:53.20 --> 01:30:57.16 And Nia, his wife and my wife were down there.
01:30:57.16 --> 01:31:02.16 And I told my wife, in spin, did she ever?
01:31:04.16 --> 01:31:09.16 She went up there and she flipped out on the guy.
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:14.16 A man to bring it, she bringing it five, two, 103 pounds.
01:31:14.16 --> 01:31:19.16 A fury.
01:31:19.16 --> 01:31:22.16 It was awesome.
01:31:22.16 --> 01:31:25.16 We flew back and the picture was already clear.
01:31:25.16 --> 01:31:31.16 This was just like added motivation, just added motivation.
01:31:31.16 --> 01:31:36.16 I called one of my buddies Tim and John was already working for me
01:31:36.16 --> 01:31:39.16 from my last business, the sole survivor, the sole survivor,
01:31:39.16 --> 01:31:43.16 moved back to Farmington.
01:31:43.16 --> 01:31:47.16 Well, we did as you grab that, that tape you put around trees.
01:31:47.16 --> 01:31:51.16 And you want to flag trees to cut and you got to flag the trees to cut.
01:31:51.16 --> 01:31:53.16 We kind of have like, I had John.
01:31:53.16 --> 01:31:57.16 I have seven acres of property, which is, okay, listen, seven acres
01:31:57.16 --> 01:31:59.16 is not a lot of property and main.
01:31:59.16 --> 01:32:04.16 You can buy property and main for $500 an acre in some places, private sale.
01:32:04.16 --> 01:32:06.16 So let's just make that clear.
01:32:06.16 --> 01:32:09.16 Seven acres is not a lot.
01:32:09.16 --> 01:32:12.16 But we have seven acres of land in the woods.
01:32:12.16 --> 01:32:14.16 And so I like flagged out.
01:32:14.16 --> 01:32:17.16 I'm like, we're going to build a factory here.
01:32:17.16 --> 01:32:20.16 We just flagged it out like this.
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:23.16 And this is based on the architectural design that you're engineered
01:32:23.16 --> 01:32:24.16 put through for your factory.
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:25.16 Yeah.
01:32:25.16 --> 01:32:26.16 All right.
01:32:26.16 --> 01:32:30.16 So he was like, I think a factory should be about this big.
01:32:30.16 --> 01:32:31.16 Yeah.
01:32:31.16 --> 01:32:33.16 This looks like a factory size.
01:32:33.16 --> 01:32:34.16 So awesome.
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:37.16 I call the buddy any brothers chains are over.
01:32:37.16 --> 01:32:39.16 And they're just like, I just do it.
01:32:39.16 --> 01:32:42.16 And we just started cutting trees.
01:32:42.16 --> 01:32:45.16 My father and I came over with a chipper.
01:32:45.16 --> 01:32:47.16 We chipped it out.
01:32:47.16 --> 01:32:48.16 Okay, we stumped it.
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:50.16 We pulled a stump out.
01:32:50.16 --> 01:32:51.16 We're pretty resourceful up in here.
01:32:51.16 --> 01:32:55.16 And maybe you ever heard Yankee ingenuity that term.
01:32:55.16 --> 01:32:56.16 For sure.
01:32:56.16 --> 01:32:58.16 That happens.
01:32:58.16 --> 01:33:01.16 So what do we do?
01:33:01.16 --> 01:33:02.16 We cleared it.
01:33:02.16 --> 01:33:05.16 We did a little bit of earthwork.
01:33:05.16 --> 01:33:08.16 I got on the compactor and compacted all the sand.
01:33:08.16 --> 01:33:13.16 And Portus Lab had had some some guy, some company.
01:33:13.16 --> 01:33:17.16 Saw her out a bunch of Eastern white pine.
01:33:17.16 --> 01:33:21.16 And had my buddy build a barn factory.
01:33:21.16 --> 01:33:22.16 Barn.
01:33:22.16 --> 01:33:26.16 And we just spent, I don't know, 1868.
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:29.16 I don't know how many hours we slept in zero hours.
01:33:29.16 --> 01:33:32.16 Around the clock, we just built this thing from the ground up.
01:33:32.16 --> 01:33:35.16 Myself, my brother, friends, family.
01:33:35.16 --> 01:33:38.16 That was just, we did it. We built it.
01:33:38.16 --> 01:33:41.16 That was stuck a sewing machine in there.
01:33:41.16 --> 01:33:43.16 That's what we've seen.
01:33:43.16 --> 01:33:44.16 That's what we've done.
01:33:44.16 --> 01:33:46.16 We're like, what are we doing?
01:33:46.16 --> 01:33:48.16 That's where it began.
01:33:48.16 --> 01:33:54.16 And the thing is, if you listen, I'm all for planning.
01:33:54.16 --> 01:34:00.16 I like to plan what's going to happen in there.
01:34:00.16 --> 01:34:03.16 Like to execute that plan.
01:34:03.16 --> 01:34:05.16 But do it.
01:34:05.16 --> 01:34:08.16 And I like to lead the plan.
01:34:08.16 --> 01:34:12.16 And I'm shitty when it comes to like,
01:34:12.16 --> 01:34:15.16 I'm always making sure everybody's living up to their expectations.
01:34:15.16 --> 01:34:17.16 Like as part of the plan, if they bought into it,
01:34:17.16 --> 01:34:19.16 you better fully bought into it.
01:34:19.16 --> 01:34:21.16 There's no room for like slacking.
01:34:21.16 --> 01:34:24.16 Like if I'm working to midnight, you're working to midnight.
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:26.16 Right? You're not leaving.
01:34:26.16 --> 01:34:28.16 So that's what we did.
01:34:28.16 --> 01:34:31.16 And I'm a pusher to you, like a push push push push.
01:34:31.16 --> 01:34:35.16 Like to see how much I can get out of somebody to push them to their potential.
01:34:35.16 --> 01:34:37.16 And see where their breaking point is.
01:34:37.16 --> 01:34:42.16 So I can learn about the person, but also get the best out of them.
01:34:42.16 --> 01:34:44.16 So we did it. We built a factory.
01:34:44.16 --> 01:34:49.16 And that's where it started.
01:34:49.16 --> 01:34:52.16 So then comes what's next sewing machines?
01:34:52.16 --> 01:34:53.16 Yeah.
01:34:53.16 --> 01:34:54.16 And sewing machines.
01:34:54.16 --> 01:34:57.16 And just started looking for staff that knew how to sell.
01:34:57.16 --> 01:34:58.16 Yeah.
01:34:58.16 --> 01:34:59.16 Exactly.
01:34:59.16 --> 01:35:02.16 So we didn't have any lights yet. We had one sewing machine.
01:35:02.16 --> 01:35:04.16 And we just like, okay, this is how we're doing.
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:05.16 This is how you sew.
01:35:05.16 --> 01:35:08.16 And I found this old time or bill who came down.
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:10.16 And he's like explaining the different types.
01:35:10.16 --> 01:35:11.16 He's been in the business for 40 years.
01:35:11.16 --> 01:35:13.16 Bixing sewing machines.
01:35:13.16 --> 01:35:16.16 And he's just like, you know, when is that X?
01:35:16.16 --> 01:35:17.16 And he's like, you know, you got that.
01:35:17.16 --> 01:35:19.16 We got a single needle machine.
01:35:19.16 --> 01:35:20.16 A double needle.
01:35:20.16 --> 01:35:22.16 And you've got the locking stitch and a chain stitch.
01:35:22.16 --> 01:35:23.16 And you know, all this stuff.
01:35:23.16 --> 01:35:25.16 And I'm just like, whoa.
01:35:25.16 --> 01:35:32.16 And so I just absorbed. It got, it became completely absorbed in that, right?
01:35:32.16 --> 01:35:34.16 Learning about sewing machines.
01:35:34.16 --> 01:35:37.16 I learned how to run them, how to fix them.
01:35:37.16 --> 01:35:39.16 What they were good for.
01:35:39.16 --> 01:35:43.16 The different types of feeding, you know, all, all, everything about sewing machines.
01:35:43.16 --> 01:35:45.16 How's that cool? I know about sewing machines.
01:35:45.16 --> 01:35:47.16 Now we need some fabric.
01:35:49.16 --> 01:35:51.16 So I started looking for fabric.
01:35:51.16 --> 01:35:58.16 Guess what? They don't make fabric in the United States.
01:35:58.16 --> 01:36:02.16 They don't make fabric that we needed in Mexico.
01:36:02.16 --> 01:36:05.16 They don't make fabric in Canada.
01:36:05.16 --> 01:36:08.16 Shit, they don't make fabric for Gigi's.
01:36:08.16 --> 01:36:13.16 And I was like, what are we going to do?
01:36:13.16 --> 01:36:16.16 What would you do?
01:36:16.16 --> 01:36:18.16 You just built a factory.
01:36:18.16 --> 01:36:22.16 And you have all these sewing machines.
01:36:22.16 --> 01:36:24.16 And what would you do?
01:36:24.16 --> 01:36:29.16 So you're only option at this point is got an order of the material from the order of the material from what we've seen.
01:36:29.16 --> 01:36:31.16 So you got it. That's what you're going to do.
01:36:31.16 --> 01:36:32.16 Right?
01:36:32.16 --> 01:36:34.16 I was like screw that.
01:36:34.16 --> 01:36:36.16 And so I started looking for like weaving.
01:36:36.16 --> 01:36:41.16 And so I just, you know, was looking for weaving like, hey, hey, hey, hey, you guys, we've
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:49.16 been doing these a far or far as 100,000 yards, you know, 12 bucks yard.
01:36:49.16 --> 01:36:52.16 No.
01:36:52.16 --> 01:36:54.16 So I'm just looking, looking, looking.
01:36:54.16 --> 01:36:56.16 And did you ever order any material?
01:36:56.16 --> 01:36:57.16 I did.
01:36:57.16 --> 01:36:59.16 Okay, because you had to sell Gigi's.
01:36:59.16 --> 01:37:00.16 I mean, I had to make some money.
01:37:00.16 --> 01:37:02.16 We got investment into this thing now.
01:37:02.16 --> 01:37:02.16 Right.
01:37:02.16 --> 01:37:07.16 And I didn't take a paycheck for like the first two years of business.
01:37:07.16 --> 01:37:08.16 I didn't take a paycheck.
01:37:08.16 --> 01:37:09.16 Maybe three.
01:37:09.16 --> 01:37:11.16 I didn't pay myself once.
01:37:11.16 --> 01:37:16.16 Every dime I just dump back in, dump back in, dump back in.
01:37:16.16 --> 01:37:19.16 Weaving was impossible.
01:37:19.16 --> 01:37:20.16 Right?
01:37:20.16 --> 01:37:22.16 You're not going to freaking weave material.
01:37:22.16 --> 01:37:23.16 So I did.
01:37:23.16 --> 01:37:26.16 I imported material for that first year.
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:31.16 And we figured out how to make a Gigi.
01:37:31.16 --> 01:37:34.16 And it was a pain in the ass.
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:37.16 And that first week.
01:37:37.16 --> 01:37:39.16 We finished the week.
01:37:39.16 --> 01:37:41.16 And I called to deco.
01:37:41.16 --> 01:37:43.16 And I said,
01:37:43.16 --> 01:37:47.16 we made five pairs of pants this week.
01:37:47.16 --> 01:37:51.16 And he's like not really high production.
01:37:51.16 --> 01:37:54.16 Dude, I was just like, what am I doing?
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:57.16 And I kind of started telling that story.
01:37:57.16 --> 01:37:59.16 You like legit or questioning.
01:37:59.16 --> 01:38:00.16 Oh, I spiral down.
01:38:00.16 --> 01:38:02.16 Like, oh, my God.
01:38:02.16 --> 01:38:05.16 You know, you thought you were going to make 200 G's in the week.
01:38:05.16 --> 01:38:06.16 Or G pants.
01:38:06.16 --> 01:38:10.16 And we can make five, five pairs of pants.
01:38:10.16 --> 01:38:14.16 I was just mind boggling.
01:38:14.16 --> 01:38:15.16 Mind boggling.
01:38:15.16 --> 01:38:17.16 And Jill was my first teacher.
01:38:17.16 --> 01:38:18.16 She's still with us today.
01:38:18.16 --> 01:38:21.16 The one you were talking about earlier.
01:38:21.16 --> 01:38:24.16 Dude, I did not know what to do.
01:38:24.16 --> 01:38:27.16 I was truly at a loss for.
01:38:27.16 --> 01:38:33.16 I didn't have anybody to teach me about how to manufacture.
01:38:33.16 --> 01:38:36.16 And I was like, how you should set this up.
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:40.16 Because the knowledge had disappeared out of the state.
01:38:40.16 --> 01:38:41.16 It was gone.
01:38:41.16 --> 01:38:43.16 The folks that used to do that stuff either.
01:38:43.16 --> 01:38:46.16 They passed or they moved on.
01:38:46.16 --> 01:38:47.16 They're still birds.
01:38:47.16 --> 01:38:48.16 They moved to Florida.
01:38:48.16 --> 01:38:49.16 Whatever.
01:38:49.16 --> 01:38:51.16 They weren't around.
01:38:51.16 --> 01:38:59.16 So I had a lot of late nights by myself in my basement.
01:38:59.16 --> 01:39:01.16 With a glass of whiskey.
01:39:01.16 --> 01:39:10.16 I started to have that feeling come back.
01:39:10.16 --> 01:39:13.16 Of that like failure feeling.
01:39:13.16 --> 01:39:19.16 And I didn't know what to do.
01:39:19.16 --> 01:39:23.16 I was like, what did I get myself into?
01:39:23.16 --> 01:39:26.16 You know, like, what are you doing?
01:39:26.16 --> 01:39:30.16 Like, how do you, what am I doing?
01:39:30.16 --> 01:39:37.16 And then I figured, like, I cannot.
01:39:37.16 --> 01:39:45.16 Basically, like, I can't do this alone type of situation.
01:39:45.16 --> 01:39:48.16 And in a conversation with my father and a house like,
01:39:48.16 --> 01:39:50.16 Joe, man, I need to talk to somebody who's like,
01:39:50.16 --> 01:39:53.16 Ben there and done that and like,
01:39:53.16 --> 01:39:55.16 done built something from nothing.
01:39:55.16 --> 01:39:59.16 And he's like, PD's like, I've got a friend that he did some work for.
01:39:59.16 --> 01:40:00.16 And his bulldozer.
01:40:00.16 --> 01:40:01.16 My father loves to have me mechanical.
01:40:01.16 --> 01:40:04.16 I've been machinery mechanic.
01:40:04.16 --> 01:40:07.16 And so we made a phone call to this guy, John.
01:40:07.16 --> 01:40:09.16 I'll leave his last name out.
01:40:09.16 --> 01:40:13.16 And John said, yeah, I'll meet with Pete.
01:40:13.16 --> 01:40:15.16 He said, here's the date and time.
01:40:15.16 --> 01:40:18.16 Meet me at my lake house.
01:40:18.16 --> 01:40:20.16 So I showed up at his lake house.
01:40:20.16 --> 01:40:23.16 And I sat down and he shook my hand.
01:40:23.16 --> 01:40:26.16 And he said, let me tell you something.
01:40:26.16 --> 01:40:29.16 You're not fucking special.
01:40:29.16 --> 01:40:31.16 I'm already Pete down.
01:40:31.16 --> 01:40:34.16 Just, I'm using his words.
01:40:34.16 --> 01:40:37.16 You're not fucking special.
01:40:37.16 --> 01:40:39.16 Your ideas aren't special.
01:40:39.16 --> 01:40:42.16 And nobody gives his shit.
01:40:42.16 --> 01:40:44.16 I was like, okay.
01:40:44.16 --> 01:40:46.16 Motivational speaker.
01:40:46.16 --> 01:40:47.16 Get an after it.
01:40:47.16 --> 01:40:49.16 No, nobody gives his shit.
01:40:49.16 --> 01:40:51.16 They said, reality check.
01:40:51.16 --> 01:40:54.16 Yeah, I was like, oh shit.
01:40:54.16 --> 01:40:57.16 He goes, what's your problem?
01:40:57.16 --> 01:41:03.16 I said, man, I, we need money to, like, he was like, no, you don't.
01:41:03.16 --> 01:41:08.16 I said, no, we need money to do this.
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:11.16 To learn how to do this and build this and, like, make this happen.
01:41:11.16 --> 01:41:15.16 I need money, the capital.
01:41:15.16 --> 01:41:16.16 He goes, Pete.
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:19.16 Were you in the back of your mind thinking you had good capital investor right here?
01:41:19.16 --> 01:41:21.16 Is it a big guy with Lake Allison?
01:41:21.16 --> 01:41:23.16 Maybe this guy's going to throw you,
01:41:23.16 --> 01:41:25.16 do you, geez, at you?
01:41:25.16 --> 01:41:26.16 No.
01:41:26.16 --> 01:41:27.16 No.
01:41:27.16 --> 01:41:29.16 I wasn't there for financial.
01:41:29.16 --> 01:41:31.16 A financial.
01:41:31.16 --> 01:41:33.16 I wasn't looking for that.
01:41:33.16 --> 01:41:34.16 But that was the solution that you saw.
01:41:34.16 --> 01:41:36.16 You didn't, that's the only solution.
01:41:36.16 --> 01:41:38.16 You just thought, I need money for this thing.
01:41:38.16 --> 01:41:39.16 Only solution.
01:41:39.16 --> 01:41:42.16 I need money.
01:41:42.16 --> 01:41:47.16 And as he kind of like beat me down.
01:41:47.16 --> 01:41:51.16 And this guy ran like a 50, I think they're $100 million company now.
01:41:51.16 --> 01:41:53.16 I thought that point was $50 million.
01:41:53.16 --> 01:41:56.16 And he was kind of retired and doing this thing.
01:41:56.16 --> 01:42:01.16 And giving his time to me for free to help another kid from industry,
01:42:01.16 --> 01:42:06.16 main, succeed.
01:42:06.16 --> 01:42:10.16 He basically educated me.
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:12.16 And two hours educated me.
01:42:12.16 --> 01:42:19.16 And I walked away from that meeting, like, with a plan, a plan of action.
01:42:19.16 --> 01:42:22.16 What was the big takeaways?
01:42:22.16 --> 01:42:32.16 He told me I need to basically find out who I was and do a personality profile.
01:42:32.16 --> 01:42:37.16 And he goes, you're probably what he say.
01:42:37.16 --> 01:42:40.16 And I and FJ, something like that.
01:42:40.16 --> 01:42:43.16 He like guessed it.
01:42:43.16 --> 01:42:46.16 When I in EJ, I'm not even exactly sure what it was.
01:42:46.16 --> 01:42:50.16 I did my personality profile to find out my strengths and weaknesses.
01:42:50.16 --> 01:42:51.16 And it was spot on.
01:42:51.16 --> 01:42:53.16 I was like, oh, he's shit.
01:42:53.16 --> 01:42:55.16 This is kind of like crazy.
01:42:55.16 --> 01:43:02.16 And then he told me, you're not all in.
01:43:02.16 --> 01:43:07.16 You don't really want to win at this.
01:43:07.16 --> 01:43:09.16 I was like, no, I do.
01:43:09.16 --> 01:43:11.16 Then go all in.
01:43:11.16 --> 01:43:12.16 How much do you believe in it?
01:43:12.16 --> 01:43:15.16 Because it's a million freaking people like you.
01:43:15.16 --> 01:43:20.16 He said, there's a million people like you and a million great ideas.
01:43:20.16 --> 01:43:29.16 And less than 1% are willing to go and chase it and go all in and do it.
01:43:29.16 --> 01:43:31.16 Are you one of those people?
01:43:31.16 --> 01:43:39.16 And if you are, solve the money problem and solve the rest of the problems.
01:43:39.16 --> 01:43:46.16 The next day I was at the bank signing my home away with my wife by my side.
01:43:46.16 --> 01:43:50.16 She was stoked for a $200,000 loan.
01:43:50.16 --> 01:43:53.16 That was tougher her.
01:43:53.16 --> 01:43:54.16 Two things.
01:43:54.16 --> 01:43:58.16 As you were saying them, there's a big difference.
01:43:58.16 --> 01:44:01.16 You put them together, which is when you put them together, it makes sense.
01:44:01.16 --> 01:44:07.16 But chasing your goals chasing your dream and being all in.
01:44:07.16 --> 01:44:09.16 It's not the same thing.
01:44:09.16 --> 01:44:14.16 Now, if you're all in and you have to chase it, you don't even know what else to do besides chase it.
01:44:14.16 --> 01:44:19.16 But I think some people they chase it, but they're running like half speed.
01:44:19.16 --> 01:44:20.16 And I was a half speed.
01:44:20.16 --> 01:44:21.16 Yeah.
01:44:21.16 --> 01:44:22.16 It's awesome.
01:44:22.16 --> 01:44:24.16 You got to be uncomfortable.
01:44:24.16 --> 01:44:26.16 That's basically what I took away from that.
01:44:26.16 --> 01:44:27.16 And he's the one that told me.
01:44:27.16 --> 01:44:29.16 He said, Pete, how old are you?
01:44:29.16 --> 01:44:31.16 I said, I'm 30.
01:44:31.16 --> 01:44:33.16 What's your problem?
01:44:33.16 --> 01:44:36.16 I said.
01:44:36.16 --> 01:44:39.16 I'm just going to get John on the podcast at some point.
01:44:39.16 --> 01:44:40.16 I'm stuck.
01:44:40.16 --> 01:44:41.16 Yeah.
01:44:41.16 --> 01:44:42.16 I said, I'm stuck.
01:44:42.16 --> 01:44:47.16 He goes, you got three more chances.
01:44:47.16 --> 01:44:48.16 He's like, I'm 60.
01:44:48.16 --> 01:44:50.16 You got three more chances.
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:56.16 He's like, if you believe in it, then he's the one that told me everything in life, everything
01:44:56.16 --> 01:44:59.16 great takes 10 years to build.
01:44:59.16 --> 01:45:05.16 Go build it and be committed because it's got to take 10 years to build it.
01:45:05.16 --> 01:45:10.16 But if you believe in it, you have to go all in.
01:45:10.16 --> 01:45:12.16 And if you've got to put up your house, put up your house.
01:45:12.16 --> 01:45:14.16 You'll work your way out of it.
01:45:14.16 --> 01:45:15.16 Eventually.
01:45:15.16 --> 01:45:17.16 So that's what I did.
01:45:17.16 --> 01:45:19.16 I followed his advice.
01:45:19.16 --> 01:45:22.16 And I went all in.
01:45:22.16 --> 01:45:27.16 He also told me the moment you stop growing, you die.
01:45:27.16 --> 01:45:31.16 He said, if you stop growing, you will die.
01:45:31.16 --> 01:45:37.16 The moment you want to do something different than what you're doing.
01:45:37.16 --> 01:45:48.16 The moment your mind wanders to wanting to be somewhere else, your business also dies.
01:45:48.16 --> 01:45:51.16 And you need to recognize that.
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:57.16 And that first meeting with him was just, it just changed my, changed my game.
01:45:57.16 --> 01:46:04.16 And when I signed my name on that loan, when I signed my home to the bank to receive that check,
01:46:04.16 --> 01:46:10.16 I was laser focused.
01:46:10.16 --> 01:46:18.16 It's like being in the woods on an early morning hunt when it's dark in the sun is coming up
01:46:18.16 --> 01:46:21.16 and the leaves go.
01:46:21.16 --> 01:46:22.16 Right.
01:46:22.16 --> 01:46:29.16 The sun hits the leaves, hits the trees and you're waiting for the deer for whatever you're
01:46:29.16 --> 01:46:30.16 hunting.
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.16 That's what I felt like about business.
01:46:33.16 --> 01:46:42.16 The same feeling you get from that I felt laser focused in it's like everything just opened up.
01:46:42.16 --> 01:46:48.16 Like my mind opened like the synapses connected in I was like a new, a new, a new,
01:46:48.16 --> 01:46:52.16 I knew I was like new.
01:46:52.16 --> 01:46:54.16 And that's what I mean by like you can't hear.
01:46:54.16 --> 01:46:55.16 At least born in entrepreneur.
01:46:55.16 --> 01:46:57.16 You're not born in entrepreneur.
01:46:57.16 --> 01:47:02.16 You need to get punched in the face and John punched me right in the nose.
01:47:02.16 --> 01:47:07.16 It was awesome.
01:47:07.16 --> 01:47:14.16 So the next step is you order some material, but that's not your long term plan.
01:47:14.16 --> 01:47:18.16 And the next thing you do is you go we got to make this material.
01:47:18.16 --> 01:47:21.16 We got to make this material.
01:47:21.16 --> 01:47:28.16 I had called every use textile company in the United States, every use textile company
01:47:28.16 --> 01:47:32.16 to try and find this machinery.
01:47:32.16 --> 01:47:36.16 We had to weave our own fabric.
01:47:36.16 --> 01:47:41.16 It wasn't a sustainable model without weaving our own fabric.
01:47:41.16 --> 01:47:45.16 They were all like, she's not going to happen.
01:47:45.16 --> 01:47:48.16 I'm like, what is it to get set up?
01:47:48.16 --> 01:47:51.16 A million dollars, right?
01:47:51.16 --> 01:47:54.16 750 grand.
01:47:54.16 --> 01:47:56.16 This is to buy a brand new loo.
01:47:56.16 --> 01:47:59.16 This is to buy the operational experience in there.
01:47:59.16 --> 01:48:01.16 They're going to send you from the factory after they build this loo.
01:48:01.16 --> 01:48:03.16 They'll send you a guy that's going to help you run it.
01:48:03.16 --> 01:48:05.16 Yeah, we just need a million dollars.
01:48:05.16 --> 01:48:07.16 Yeah, exactly.
01:48:07.16 --> 01:48:09.16 It's just not going to happen.
01:48:09.16 --> 01:48:16.16 I was like, okay, in business, it's like boxing, like it's like the Gitu.
01:48:16.16 --> 01:48:18.16 It's all about the angles.
01:48:18.16 --> 01:48:23.16 You know, when people get so stuck on like one angle, they can only see that one angle.
01:48:23.16 --> 01:48:30.16 And I just had to like, I had to step to the side and I had to see this angle.
01:48:30.16 --> 01:48:33.16 I knew Maine had a heritage in weaving.
01:48:33.16 --> 01:48:37.16 I knew there was weaving here at one point.
01:48:37.16 --> 01:48:41.16 And so I went back to that same old time, reduced in Maine, who had sold me my fur,
01:48:41.16 --> 01:48:46.16 sewing machine, and I sat in his office, and I said,
01:48:46.16 --> 01:48:50.16 No, where there are any looms.
01:48:50.16 --> 01:48:52.16 Is that what you mean?
01:48:52.16 --> 01:48:54.16 A weaving loom?
01:48:54.16 --> 01:48:57.16 Like to weave fabric?
01:48:57.16 --> 01:49:00.16 He goes, getting my truck?
01:49:00.16 --> 01:49:02.16 I get in this truck.
01:49:02.16 --> 01:49:06.16 We drive up one street and get out.
01:49:06.16 --> 01:49:08.16 And this is massive building.
01:49:08.16 --> 01:49:13.16 It's like, I think total square footage was like 1.5 million square feet.
01:49:13.16 --> 01:49:16.16 Mostly abandoned.
01:49:16.16 --> 01:49:20.16 A few businesses in the front that they've refurbished.
01:49:20.16 --> 01:49:23.16 And there's a museum there.
01:49:23.16 --> 01:49:27.16 And then walks in and introduces me to this woman Rachel.
01:49:27.16 --> 01:49:31.16 And he says, Rachel, this is Pete.
01:49:31.16 --> 01:49:33.16 He's looking for a loom.
01:49:33.16 --> 01:49:38.16 And she goes, well, follow me.
01:49:38.16 --> 01:49:40.16 She made me sign a release.
01:49:40.16 --> 01:49:44.16 We went up these stairs and into this old mill five.
01:49:44.16 --> 01:49:47.16 And the floorboards, the windows were all broken.
01:49:47.16 --> 01:49:49.16 The sock tooth building, you know, the sock tooth mill buildings.
01:49:49.16 --> 01:49:50.16 And windows were all broken.
01:49:50.16 --> 01:49:55.16 The wood was all punky and like, like, a bent-op and splinter.
01:49:55.16 --> 01:49:58.16 You had like watch where you're walking.
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:02.16 And there's this big green nasty thing sitting in the middle of floor.
01:50:02.16 --> 01:50:06.16 Right there in this whole place.
01:50:06.16 --> 01:50:08.16 And we walk over to it.
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:12.16 She's like, I need to get rid of this.
01:50:12.16 --> 01:50:15.16 And I'm like, this is a loom.
01:50:15.16 --> 01:50:18.16 And she's like, yep.
01:50:18.16 --> 01:50:23.16 She's the holy shit.
01:50:23.16 --> 01:50:26.16 Where's the rest of them?
01:50:26.16 --> 01:50:29.16 They ship them overseas.
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:32.16 They're company and India bought us bought about $1,000.
01:50:32.16 --> 01:50:34.16 They shipped everything overseas.
01:50:34.16 --> 01:50:36.16 And she goes, I kept this one.
01:50:36.16 --> 01:50:39.16 I kept it here because I wanted to put it in the museum.
01:50:39.16 --> 01:50:42.16 So we didn't lose our heritage.
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:46.16 I said, can I buy it?
01:50:46.16 --> 01:50:47.16 And she said, yep.
01:50:47.16 --> 01:50:48.16 That's it.
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:49.16 I'll watch it.
01:50:49.16 --> 01:50:50.16 $3,000.
01:50:50.16 --> 01:50:51.16 That's it.
01:50:51.16 --> 01:50:52.16 Done.
01:50:52.16 --> 01:50:53.16 Man.
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:56.16 And this was like, I just want to point this out.
01:50:56.16 --> 01:51:00.16 The the the floor is all broken.
01:51:00.16 --> 01:51:01.16 The windows are broken.
01:51:01.16 --> 01:51:03.16 And the loom is like rusty, right?
01:51:03.16 --> 01:51:04.16 Oh, dude.
01:51:04.16 --> 01:51:05.16 This is not like this.
01:51:05.16 --> 01:51:07.16 This thing is disaster.
01:51:07.16 --> 01:51:08.16 When was the last time it was used?
01:51:08.16 --> 01:51:09.16 How many years ago?
01:51:09.16 --> 01:51:11.16 Oh, 80s.
01:51:11.16 --> 01:51:13.16 It was it's in 83.
01:51:13.16 --> 01:51:14.16 It's like a 1983.
01:51:14.16 --> 01:51:16.16 I don't know when the last time it was used.
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:19.16 But it hadn't been had any to love for it a long long time.
01:51:19.16 --> 01:51:22.16 Most of the parts were stripped off of it.
01:51:22.16 --> 01:51:25.16 It was like a frame just like an infrastructure.
01:51:25.16 --> 01:51:29.16 I said, okay, I'm I'm I'm going to buy this loom.
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:30.16 Yeah.
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:39.16 So you've got to be a little bit naive to be in business and think you can accomplish anything.
01:51:39.16 --> 01:51:40.16 That's the bottom line.
01:51:40.16 --> 01:51:50.16 And I was pretty pretty driven and naive to think that we could weave fabric.
01:51:50.16 --> 01:51:54.16 But I believe we could.
01:51:54.16 --> 01:51:56.16 So she sold me it.
01:51:56.16 --> 01:52:00.16 And then I called my father-in-law and I said, I got a loom.
01:52:00.16 --> 01:52:04.16 It's on the third floor of this old mill in Louis,
01:52:04.16 --> 01:52:05.16 in Maine.
01:52:05.16 --> 01:52:08.16 And when he needed to get it out.
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:12.16 And I got a quote on moving in and it was $25,000 to move it.
01:52:12.16 --> 01:52:14.16 And I'm like we're going to move it.
01:52:14.16 --> 01:52:16.16 And he's like.
01:52:16.16 --> 01:52:17.16 Okay.
01:52:17.16 --> 01:52:19.16 So I got a bunch of friends.
01:52:19.16 --> 01:52:21.16 We went up there.
01:52:21.16 --> 01:52:29.16 Took nine guys, eight hours to move it from the middle to the floor to the edge of the building.
01:52:29.16 --> 01:52:40.16 And we had another friend who had a crane and we ended up getting it out and onto a trailer and put it in the factory.
01:52:40.16 --> 01:52:44.16 And then we were like, well, are we doing dude?
01:52:44.16 --> 01:52:47.16 It was awesome.
01:52:47.16 --> 01:52:48.16 It was awesome.
01:52:48.16 --> 01:52:53.16 So that's where it started.
01:52:53.16 --> 01:53:00.16 You know, I always believe like if it was done, it can be done.
01:53:00.16 --> 01:53:05.16 Like if it, if, if, you know, in Maine, we have this thing like,
01:53:05.16 --> 01:53:08.16 Maine at one point was 90% field.
01:53:08.16 --> 01:53:12.16 How to become 90% field, you know, 100 years ago.
01:53:12.16 --> 01:53:14.16 Hands and daylight.
01:53:14.16 --> 01:53:15.16 Hands and daylight.
01:53:15.16 --> 01:53:16.16 Right?
01:53:16.16 --> 01:53:19.16 So these mill buildings built hands and daylight.
01:53:19.16 --> 01:53:21.16 That's it.
01:53:21.16 --> 01:53:23.16 These people, they got after it.
01:53:23.16 --> 01:53:25.16 I mean, why?
01:53:25.16 --> 01:53:27.16 Because if you don't, you die.
01:53:27.16 --> 01:53:28.16 That's it.
01:53:28.16 --> 01:53:29.16 You're going to die.
01:53:29.16 --> 01:53:30.16 So you've got a farm.
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:32.16 You've got to know how to build a house.
01:53:32.16 --> 01:53:33.16 You got to know how to start a fire.
01:53:33.16 --> 01:53:38.16 Like that culture of New England is still rich.
01:53:38.16 --> 01:53:40.16 You know, it's still passed down.
01:53:40.16 --> 01:53:41.16 We burn wood.
01:53:41.16 --> 01:53:42.16 Everybody burns wood.
01:53:42.16 --> 01:53:43.16 We build our own shit.
01:53:43.16 --> 01:53:45.16 You know, houses, everything.
01:53:45.16 --> 01:53:46.16 That's what we do.
01:53:46.16 --> 01:53:49.16 Why is everybody saying we can't manufacture.
01:53:49.16 --> 01:53:52.16 We can't, we, we can't cut in the so.
01:53:52.16 --> 01:53:54.16 That's bullshit.
01:53:54.16 --> 01:54:01.16 If they did it, we can do it because they did it with a lot less.
01:54:01.16 --> 01:54:04.16 I found a guy, Lenny.
01:54:04.16 --> 01:54:11.16 When that mill shut down, he had a contract to go over to Pakistan,
01:54:11.16 --> 01:54:14.16 Pakistan of all places.
01:54:14.16 --> 01:54:23.16 To teach them how to run the looms that were purchased.
01:54:23.16 --> 01:54:25.16 And a month later, it was 9-11.
01:54:25.16 --> 01:54:27.16 And he didn't go.
01:54:27.16 --> 01:54:29.16 And he stayed here.
01:54:29.16 --> 01:54:34.16 Thank God because he's the last.
01:54:34.16 --> 01:54:36.16 He's like the last one.
01:54:36.16 --> 01:54:39.16 Left of that can actually get this thing going.
01:54:39.16 --> 01:54:43.16 And make it work again.
01:54:43.16 --> 01:54:48.16 I asked Lenny, how many people know what you know.
01:54:48.16 --> 01:54:51.16 He said, a whole bunch.
01:54:51.16 --> 01:54:52.16 I said, what's a whole bunch?
01:54:52.16 --> 01:54:56.16 He's like a five.
01:54:56.16 --> 01:55:00.16 So he, Lenny passes knowledge on us, weaving,
01:55:00.16 --> 01:55:07.16 pattern making for textiles and all this stuff.
01:55:07.16 --> 01:55:09.16 And that's a whole nother story.
01:55:09.16 --> 01:55:11.16 Maybe for a different time.
01:55:11.16 --> 01:55:14.16 But we started weaving fabric.
01:55:14.16 --> 01:55:16.16 And we became vertically integrated.
01:55:16.16 --> 01:55:19.16 And we started making the product from Rockhawn from textiles.
01:55:19.16 --> 01:55:23.16 What did he feel like the first time that thing created fabric?
01:55:23.16 --> 01:55:25.16 He must have been freed.
01:55:25.16 --> 01:55:30.16 We were just like, he's just like, we had the, we had the,
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:32.16 like we had to make Pearl weave.
01:55:32.16 --> 01:55:33.16 And so we did.
01:55:33.16 --> 01:55:34.16 We made Pearl weave.
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:36.16 We looked up Pearl weave of part.
01:55:36.16 --> 01:55:39.16 That was like from the imported fabric.
01:55:39.16 --> 01:55:42.16 We just picked it apart and Lenny looked at it and figured out what?
01:55:42.16 --> 01:55:45.16 Size thread, you know, yarns and the weight and everything.
01:55:45.16 --> 01:55:47.16 So we just recreated it.
01:55:47.16 --> 01:55:49.16 And he turned it on for the first time.
01:55:49.16 --> 01:55:52.16 You know how long took to clean that thing?
01:55:52.16 --> 01:55:55.16 40 man hours to clean it.
01:55:55.16 --> 01:55:57.16 Like it just, they need to cleaning.
01:55:57.16 --> 01:56:00.16 Before we did anything cleaning, then we had to buy it all the parts.
01:56:00.16 --> 01:56:01.16 Or have a machine.
01:56:01.16 --> 01:56:03.16 And just to get it going in.
01:56:03.16 --> 01:56:05.16 He turned it off for the first time.
01:56:05.16 --> 01:56:08.16 And it was like, boom.
01:56:08.16 --> 01:56:17.16 And I looked at John, my employee John Lenny and I said, oh,
01:56:17.16 --> 01:56:19.16 oh, he sh**t.
01:56:19.16 --> 01:56:23.16 And then, and there it comes.
01:56:23.16 --> 01:56:26.16 And there's the Pearl weave coming off the loom.
01:56:26.16 --> 01:56:28.16 Man, it was so exciting.
01:56:28.16 --> 01:56:31.16 I was like, nobody's ever done this.
01:56:31.16 --> 01:56:33.16 Nobody's ever done this.
01:56:33.16 --> 01:56:36.16 And it was, I was super proud.
01:56:36.16 --> 01:56:39.16 I was like, we're, we're freaking doing it.
01:56:39.16 --> 01:56:41.16 We are doing it.
01:56:41.16 --> 01:56:43.16 And then we announced it to the world.
01:56:43.16 --> 01:56:47.16 We thought we still got a lot of work to do.
01:56:47.16 --> 01:56:54.16 But now we announce it to the Jiu Jitsu world.
01:56:54.16 --> 01:56:55.16 Sit, man.
01:56:55.16 --> 01:56:58.16 How do you even want to tell you the challenges after weaving?
01:56:58.16 --> 01:56:59.16 How do you color this stuff?
01:56:59.16 --> 01:57:00.16 How do you do this?
01:57:00.16 --> 01:57:01.16 How many of this?
01:57:01.16 --> 01:57:04.16 I was telling you before when I was in this single team
01:57:04.16 --> 01:57:06.16 in the early 90s.
01:57:06.16 --> 01:57:09.16 We didn't have the custom gear, right?
01:57:09.16 --> 01:57:13.16 You couldn't buy this stuff on the internet from these tactical companies, right?
01:57:13.16 --> 01:57:14.16 So we made stuff.
01:57:14.16 --> 01:57:19.16 And we had parachute rigors, which are the people that pack parachutes.
01:57:19.16 --> 01:57:22.16 But in a parachute loft, you've got a nice medium duty.
01:57:22.16 --> 01:57:24.16 And sometimes a heavy duty, so we machine.
01:57:24.16 --> 01:57:26.16 And so we would make our own gear.
01:57:26.16 --> 01:57:29.16 And us guys, like, we would kind of get into it a little bit.
01:57:29.16 --> 01:57:32.16 And I, you know, I had us a lot of seals.
01:57:32.16 --> 01:57:35.16 Would have their own, you know, sewing machines.
01:57:35.16 --> 01:57:37.16 And, you know, you make gear.
01:57:37.16 --> 01:57:39.16 And some people would be good at it.
01:57:39.16 --> 01:57:40.16 Some people would get really good at it.
01:57:40.16 --> 01:57:42.16 And I was not one of those people.
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:45.16 And because, you know, there's these little threads.
01:57:45.16 --> 01:57:47.16 And you've got to get these things working right.
01:57:47.16 --> 01:57:49.16 You pull it through the fable and through the fable and through the fable.
01:57:49.16 --> 01:57:50.16 So obviously stuff.
01:57:50.16 --> 01:57:51.16 It's all this stuff.
01:57:51.16 --> 01:57:52.16 Yeah.
01:57:52.16 --> 01:57:54.16 And so, and every time I like start sewing,
01:57:54.16 --> 01:57:56.16 it would just, you know, fall apart.
01:57:56.16 --> 01:57:59.16 Like birds nest and just mayhem.
01:57:59.16 --> 01:58:02.16 And when I see, like, the loom.
01:58:02.16 --> 01:58:03.16 Yeah.
01:58:03.16 --> 01:58:05.16 With, it looks like stress you out.
01:58:05.16 --> 01:58:09.16 One billion twins coming through these little things.
01:58:09.16 --> 01:58:11.16 And, and they're flowing through.
01:58:11.16 --> 01:58:14.16 And then you look on the other side and all that craziness.
01:58:14.16 --> 01:58:17.16 There's like these hundreds of thousands.
01:58:17.16 --> 01:58:20.16 It looks like little pins that are moving and things that are pulling apart.
01:58:20.16 --> 01:58:21.16 And crazy.
01:58:21.16 --> 01:58:23.16 And then it comes out the other side and you see this pattern.
01:58:23.16 --> 01:58:24.16 Yeah.
01:58:24.16 --> 01:58:26.16 And it, it, it makes me, it actually does stress.
01:58:26.16 --> 01:58:27.16 Yeah.
01:58:27.16 --> 01:58:30.16 I mean, I can't be in here for too long because I'm freaking out.
01:58:30.16 --> 01:58:33.16 Just thinking, if I get too close to these things.
01:58:33.16 --> 01:58:33.16 Oh yeah.
01:58:33.16 --> 01:58:37.16 My, my presence will cause disturbances in the fable.
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:37.16 Yeah.
01:58:37.16 --> 01:58:38.16 And things will be wrong.
01:58:38.16 --> 01:58:39.16 Yeah.
01:58:39.16 --> 01:58:42.16 I'm not allowed to be in there for very long because I'm like,
01:58:42.16 --> 01:58:45.16 I'm, I've got, I've got an issue, you know,
01:58:45.16 --> 01:58:48.16 a subliminal issue with threads.
01:58:48.16 --> 01:58:52.16 And so I keep, even today, I have to keep in a little distance from the machines.
01:58:52.16 --> 01:58:53.16 Yeah.
01:58:53.16 --> 01:58:54.16 I don't want to found them up.
01:58:54.16 --> 01:58:55.16 You guys have the magic.
01:58:55.16 --> 01:58:56.16 Yeah.
01:58:56.16 --> 01:58:57.16 I'm like, stay away from that.
01:58:57.16 --> 01:58:58.16 But you had to see that.
01:58:58.16 --> 01:59:02.16 And to even imagine it, like, you know, again, as a novice person,
01:59:02.16 --> 01:59:07.16 working with a sewing machine as a young kid, the, how hard it was for me to do it.
01:59:07.16 --> 01:59:09.16 And then, like I was watching Jill, the other way, I'm,
01:59:09.16 --> 01:59:11.16 I'm, I'm just hammering.
01:59:11.16 --> 01:59:15.16 You're just, it's like, such a good craft, such a good skill to have.
01:59:15.16 --> 01:59:18.16 And, and just to see the loom and all those different parts,
01:59:18.16 --> 01:59:21.16 you're saying yourself, well, for one thing,
01:59:21.16 --> 01:59:24.16 but good luck, like somebody wants to do what we're doing.
01:59:24.16 --> 01:59:25.16 Oh, go.
01:59:25.16 --> 01:59:26.16 Yeah.
01:59:26.16 --> 01:59:27.16 Do it.
01:59:27.16 --> 01:59:27.16 Yeah.
01:59:27.16 --> 01:59:28.16 Have fun with that one.
01:59:28.16 --> 01:59:29.16 Not happening.
01:59:29.16 --> 01:59:30.16 Not happening.
01:59:30.16 --> 01:59:31.16 By the way, we bought the last loom.
01:59:31.16 --> 01:59:32.16 It's in your ass.
01:59:32.16 --> 01:59:33.16 Yeah.
01:59:33.16 --> 01:59:34.16 It's your screw.
01:59:34.16 --> 01:59:36.16 If you had your screw, yeah, absolutely.
01:59:36.16 --> 01:59:40.16 And, and the last bit of knowledge would succeed, which exists.
01:59:40.16 --> 01:59:41.16 Yeah.
01:59:41.16 --> 01:59:42.16 Man.
01:59:42.16 --> 01:59:45.16 And so then, you know, you, you take and you start weaving it.
01:59:45.16 --> 01:59:48.16 And now you start to sell geese and how the business going now.
01:59:48.16 --> 01:59:52.16 Now you're able to put on something, made in the USA.
01:59:52.16 --> 01:59:53.16 100%.
01:59:53.16 --> 01:59:56.16 And that's from the dirt to the shirt.
01:59:56.16 --> 01:59:57.16 Yeah.
01:59:57.16 --> 01:59:58.16 Can we rock it?
01:59:58.16 --> 01:59:59.16 Yeah.
01:59:59.16 --> 02:00:00.16 I'm ready.
02:00:00.16 --> 02:00:01.16 Dirt to shirt, right?
02:00:01.16 --> 02:00:06.16 I mean, because the finish, because the cotton is coming from Tennessee, Delta region,
02:00:06.16 --> 02:00:10.16 Tennessee, spun in the Carolinas and shipped up to us.
02:00:10.16 --> 02:00:12.16 That's like the, that's old school.
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:13.16 Freaking right?
02:00:13.16 --> 02:00:14.16 It is the way.
02:00:14.16 --> 02:00:15.16 It's the way.
02:00:15.16 --> 02:00:16.16 It's the work.
02:00:16.16 --> 02:00:17.16 That's old school.
02:00:17.16 --> 02:00:18.16 Making shit, you know?
02:00:18.16 --> 02:00:22.16 I mean, I talked today a little bit at our grand old school.
02:00:22.16 --> 02:00:24.16 But at our grand opening about like,
02:00:24.16 --> 02:00:25.16 Manors.
02:00:25.16 --> 02:00:35.16 Generations of folks that put their hands on something, right?
02:00:35.16 --> 02:00:37.16 They're makers.
02:00:37.16 --> 02:00:39.16 They need to make something.
02:00:39.16 --> 02:00:43.16 And they're trying to cross train these people to.
02:00:43.16 --> 02:00:49.16 Type on a computer, you know, do mundane office type of tasks, filing papers,
02:00:49.16 --> 02:00:54.16 answering the phone and call centers.
02:00:54.16 --> 02:00:56.16 These people want to make shit.
02:00:56.16 --> 02:01:02.16 We're known in Maine for being some of the best crafts people in the world.
02:01:02.16 --> 02:01:08.16 The products that come from Maine are some of the best products in the world.
02:01:08.16 --> 02:01:14.16 And to be part of resurrecting that heritage is, it's incredible.
02:01:14.16 --> 02:01:17.16 You know, and it is our ultimate mission.
02:01:17.16 --> 02:01:32.16 You know, to resurrect our heritage and manufacturing and build old world level quality products and stand behind it.
02:01:32.16 --> 02:01:35.16 Stitch.
02:01:35.16 --> 02:01:37.16 Every stitch.
02:01:37.16 --> 02:01:40.16 Every yarn in the weave.
02:01:40.16 --> 02:01:42.16 And that's what we're all about.
02:01:42.16 --> 02:01:44.16 And that's what origin stands for.
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:49.16 We're the little bit more modern look and feel.
02:01:49.16 --> 02:01:55.16 But sourcing and manufacturing 100% in the US.
02:01:55.16 --> 02:01:59.16 And I, I, we won't compromise on that.
02:01:59.16 --> 02:02:00.16 At ever.
02:02:00.16 --> 02:02:04.16 Like other companies do when they get greedy.
02:02:04.16 --> 02:02:08.16 And they say, well, it's time to look at the numbers.
02:02:08.16 --> 02:02:13.16 It's time to increase the margins and we got to import some of the stuff.
02:02:13.16 --> 02:02:16.16 And we're not just not doing it.
02:02:16.16 --> 02:02:19.16 It's not happening.
02:02:19.16 --> 02:02:26.16 I was in that background works for the awesome, the Christening of the USM Michael Montsour.
02:02:26.16 --> 02:02:29.16 Obviously named after Michael Montsour.
02:02:29.16 --> 02:02:32.16 And it was awesome for me.
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:37.16 You know, I, I, I, in listen to the Navy from down in Portland.
02:02:37.16 --> 02:02:42.16 And to come back 20, six years later.
02:02:42.16 --> 02:02:45.16 And see what you're talking about.
02:02:45.16 --> 02:02:49.16 What, what I knew existed in New England in Maine.
02:02:49.16 --> 02:02:55.16 And, and see in the pride that these, you know, ship builders,
02:02:55.16 --> 02:03:02.16 the iron workers that the pride that they took in that ship named after a,
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:05.16 a, a saint of a human being.
02:03:05.16 --> 02:03:10.16 And, you know, that's one of the things that I tied to.
02:03:10.16 --> 02:03:13.16 And I was like, you know, you know, you're going to get to the origin.
02:03:13.16 --> 02:03:16.16 Because I knew what you were doing up here.
02:03:16.16 --> 02:03:17.16 Yeah.
02:03:17.16 --> 02:03:21.16 And, you know, to kind of get to how we ended up joining forces.
02:03:21.16 --> 02:03:26.16 It's funny because, you know, you were just some guy, you know,
02:03:26.16 --> 02:03:31.16 some crazy guy up in Maine in my opinion, that I'd, well, I'd seen a couple of your videos.
02:03:31.16 --> 02:03:32.16 And I've seen it.
02:03:32.16 --> 02:03:37.16 I see a dude, you know, you have the video that shows you pulling this freaking loom out of this factory.
02:03:37.16 --> 02:03:40.16 And I'm just thinking of myself, this guy is insane.
02:03:40.16 --> 02:03:42.16 And I think I like him.
02:03:42.16 --> 02:03:46.16 And, and, and I had actually, the funny thing is for my Jim and San Diego,
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:50.16 Victory MMA, I wanted to make Jiu-Jitsu Giz in America.
02:03:50.16 --> 02:03:52.16 And so I was like, okay, this, I looked around.
02:03:52.16 --> 02:03:54.16 I find one guy that's doing it.
02:03:54.16 --> 02:03:55.16 It's you.
02:03:55.16 --> 02:03:59.16 We, like, three or four years ago, we went back and forth on email.
02:03:59.16 --> 02:04:01.16 And, you know, nothing ever came of it.
02:04:01.16 --> 02:04:02.16 Because, you know, I was busy.
02:04:02.16 --> 02:04:04.16 You were busy and just nothing happened.
02:04:04.16 --> 02:04:06.16 But I always just remember, hey, you know what?
02:04:06.16 --> 02:04:10.16 This guy up in Maine, he's, he's, he's doing what he's doing.
02:04:10.16 --> 02:04:11.16 It the right way.
02:04:11.16 --> 02:04:19.16 And what happened was the way we actually got connected was I was on a face book live.
02:04:19.16 --> 02:04:21.16 Just talking to people.
02:04:21.16 --> 02:04:24.16 And someone says, what kind of geesh did I get?
02:04:24.16 --> 02:04:26.16 And I just rattled off.
02:04:26.16 --> 02:04:30.16 I go, hey, man, if you're gonna, if you need a geet, you're starting to jitsu or you're good at jitsu or you just want a good geet.
02:04:30.16 --> 02:04:33.16 I go, get a geet from origin.
02:04:33.16 --> 02:04:34.16 Origin main.com.
02:04:34.16 --> 02:04:36.16 I go, get a geet from there. I go, this crazy guy up there.
02:04:36.16 --> 02:04:38.16 He fixed a looove.
02:04:38.16 --> 02:04:39.16 I can't say it without laughing.
02:04:39.16 --> 02:04:40.16 He's so crazy.
02:04:40.16 --> 02:04:48.16 I'm like, he took a loom out of a broken factory and he re-verbored that thing with his team and they built, you know, they're doing it.
02:04:48.16 --> 02:04:49.16 They're building it.
02:04:49.16 --> 02:04:57.16 So if you need a geet, I said, I'm trying to talk to this guy because I had reached out to you a couple times if two very even since the time I asked for four gees.
02:04:57.16 --> 02:04:58.16 Right.
02:04:58.16 --> 02:05:00.16 I'd said, since you need mail or something.
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:02.16 And I said, you know, I'm trying to talk to anybody knows this guy.
02:05:02.16 --> 02:05:05.16 His name is Pete. I go, tell him I said, what's up.
02:05:05.16 --> 02:05:10.16 And this, this awesome woman that listens to podcasts.
02:05:10.16 --> 02:05:17.16 Her name is Sarah Armstrong and she's super square away, you know, a professional with a big company.
02:05:17.16 --> 02:05:25.16 And she, you know, she did communicate with a various things over the over the past year that I've been doing the podcast and whatnot.
02:05:25.16 --> 02:05:29.16 And for, she said, oh, I'll take that for action.
02:05:29.16 --> 02:05:30.16 And she contacted me.
02:05:30.16 --> 02:05:32.16 She contacted me.
02:05:32.16 --> 02:05:33.16 She called me.
02:05:33.16 --> 02:05:36.16 She said, what would she say?
02:05:36.16 --> 02:05:42.16 She just said, you basically she's like, have you heard of this guy,
02:05:42.16 --> 02:05:44.16 Jock Willink and do them sorry.
02:05:44.16 --> 02:05:47.16 I had my head up my ass for the last five years trying to build this factory.
02:05:47.16 --> 02:05:48.16 No factor.
02:05:48.16 --> 02:05:49.16 And I was like, you're like, who?
02:05:49.16 --> 02:05:50.16 No.
02:05:50.16 --> 02:05:52.16 And then so, you know, what do I do?
02:05:52.16 --> 02:05:55.16 I dig and like, holy shit.
02:05:55.16 --> 02:05:58.16 Like this guy is making some waves.
02:05:58.16 --> 02:06:00.16 This is awesome.
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:04.16 And so I did a little recon.
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:08.16 And then I reached out to after that.
02:06:08.16 --> 02:06:13.16 And what's awesome is like, I had no idea what we were going to do.
02:06:13.16 --> 02:06:14.16 Yeah.
02:06:14.16 --> 02:06:20.16 You know, we went back and forth a couple times an email and then find me, you're like, hey, man, let's, let's just go to Skype.
02:06:20.16 --> 02:06:21.16 Right.
02:06:21.16 --> 02:06:22.16 Let's do Skype.
02:06:22.16 --> 02:06:24.16 Because we'd been, I today, you know, do you want to do something?
02:06:24.16 --> 02:06:25.16 You're like, I want to do something.
02:06:25.16 --> 02:06:29.16 Like, no, let's figure it out.
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:33.16 So I have my meetings like scheduled and I'm working all day.
02:06:33.16 --> 02:06:34.16 Sure.
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:37.16 And I blocked two hours.
02:06:37.16 --> 02:06:40.16 I'm like, you know what, this is probably going to take a while to get this conversation going.
02:06:40.16 --> 02:06:41.16 I'm about two hours.
02:06:41.16 --> 02:06:43.16 We're just going to get on Skype and make this happen.
02:06:43.16 --> 02:06:45.16 We'll figure out what we can do.
02:06:45.16 --> 02:06:49.16 So we end up talking on Skype for four hours.
02:06:49.16 --> 02:06:54.16 Talking, laughing, talking, laughing, yelling, laughing, laughing, laughing.
02:06:54.16 --> 02:06:59.16 After I got off my wife goes, it sounded like you were talking to you.
02:06:59.16 --> 02:07:01.16 That's not good.
02:07:01.16 --> 02:07:03.16 It's just a little scared.
02:07:03.16 --> 02:07:08.16 And it was just, you know, it was awesome.
02:07:08.16 --> 02:07:16.16 For me, it was, you know, the things that I believe in as an American as a person, as a New Englander,
02:07:16.16 --> 02:07:21.16 it was like you had the thing that I didn't have.
02:07:21.16 --> 02:07:22.16 Right?
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:28.16 Like, you know, for instance, we're making things, we're building things, but we don't have vertical integration.
02:07:28.16 --> 02:07:32.16 We don't, we don't, we weren't doing it the way I want to get it done.
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.16 And so, you know what I'm saying?
02:07:34.16 --> 02:07:36.16 Hey, like, let's join forces.
02:07:36.16 --> 02:07:37.16 Yeah, absolutely.
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:43.16 And from my perspective, of course, I was like, the student is for real.
02:07:43.16 --> 02:07:47.16 I was like, I don't want to tell my wife, I'm like, man, it's guy.
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:49.16 He's on another level.
02:07:49.16 --> 02:07:52.16 And we had been like looking for somebody.
02:07:52.16 --> 02:07:59.16 I remember talking with the deco and it's like, in GG2, it's like, you've got all these world champs.
02:07:59.16 --> 02:08:04.16 And then you have like the flavor of the month guys with like the fancy GG2 stuff.
02:08:04.16 --> 02:08:11.16 And we just, it just never part of our plan to sponsor GG2 world champions, right?
02:08:11.16 --> 02:08:14.16 Because what we were trying to build is like much bigger than that.
02:08:14.16 --> 02:08:17.16 It's like, man, we've been talking for like a year.
02:08:17.16 --> 02:08:27.16 Like we need to, we need to find somebody or partner somebody with somebody that like represents origin through and through.
02:08:27.16 --> 02:08:31.16 In multiple ways, this isn't possible.
02:08:31.16 --> 02:08:33.16 We will not find this person.
02:08:33.16 --> 02:08:36.16 It's not possible.
02:08:36.16 --> 02:08:38.16 And then we talk.
02:08:38.16 --> 02:08:41.16 You know, we were talking earlier today.
02:08:41.16 --> 02:08:44.16 This was, this was classic because I didn't remember this.
02:08:44.16 --> 02:08:52.16 So for those of you that know anything about negotiation, whether you're negotiating car purchase or whatever.
02:08:52.16 --> 02:08:58.16 One of the things, one of the tactics of negotiation is you don't give a number first.
02:08:58.16 --> 02:09:04.16 So if I want, if echo wants to buy these sunglasses, he, he says, how much of these.
02:09:04.16 --> 02:09:08.16 I don't say they're 10 bucks because what if he was willing to pay 20, right?
02:09:08.16 --> 02:09:12.16 So so, you know, if he says, how much of these, I go, well, you know, what are you willing to pay for?
02:09:12.16 --> 02:09:14.16 And he should say, well, you know, I don't know, what are they worth to you?
02:09:14.16 --> 02:09:17.16 And so Pete and I had the textbook.
02:09:17.16 --> 02:09:20.16 It was more than that though because it was, it was the strategies.
02:09:20.16 --> 02:09:22.16 It's like, what do you got to do?
02:09:22.16 --> 02:09:25.16 You've got to devalue or show value.
02:09:25.16 --> 02:09:26.16 Yeah.
02:09:26.16 --> 02:09:27.16 So going back and forth.
02:09:27.16 --> 02:09:28.16 Well, yeah.
02:09:28.16 --> 02:09:29.16 Well, yeah.
02:09:29.16 --> 02:09:34.16 Yeah, but, you know, it's like, you know, back and forth battle, battle, battle.
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:34.16 Yeah.
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:35.16 And then I came.
02:09:35.16 --> 02:09:39.16 And it's, so I were trying to figure out the value of whatever of something.
02:09:39.16 --> 02:09:43.16 And, and I'm like, well, you know, like, I don't just give, I mean, what if you had to,
02:09:43.16 --> 02:09:47.16 what would you say, number of people that and he's, you know, he's gives me X.
02:09:47.16 --> 02:09:49.16 And I didn't remember doing this pretty till we did that.
02:09:49.16 --> 02:09:53.16 And then I remember, as you said, you know, the value's probably X.
02:09:53.16 --> 02:09:55.16 And I went, you're weak.
02:09:55.16 --> 02:09:56.16 He's broken.
02:09:56.16 --> 02:09:58.16 We both started laughing this together.
02:09:58.16 --> 02:10:00.16 Because we've been playing the game for so long.
02:10:00.16 --> 02:10:04.16 It was like, actually, that is what, like both,
02:10:04.16 --> 02:10:08.16 I think both of us realized, like, we were just, let's just get it.
02:10:08.16 --> 02:10:09.16 Let's do this.
02:10:09.16 --> 02:10:10.16 Yeah.
02:10:10.16 --> 02:10:12.16 But actually, you know, I'm busy, you're busy.
02:10:12.16 --> 02:10:13.16 Yeah.
02:10:13.16 --> 02:10:18.16 And so we, and we actually, we both definitely got along.
02:10:18.16 --> 02:10:19.16 Yeah.
02:10:19.16 --> 02:10:23.16 We, I mean, I think both of us felt really solid about the other person.
02:10:23.16 --> 02:10:27.16 But we didn't quite figure out how to, we couldn't figure out how to make this work.
02:10:27.16 --> 02:10:28.16 Yeah.
02:10:28.16 --> 02:10:29.16 Right.
02:10:29.16 --> 02:10:34.16 You know, he's got something that he's put years of blood, sweat, tears into.
02:10:34.16 --> 02:10:38.16 I've got something that I've been doing my life has been to get to here.
02:10:38.16 --> 02:10:41.16 And so we just couldn't quite figure out how this is going to work.
02:10:41.16 --> 02:10:43.16 So we just, you know, we kept in touch.
02:10:43.16 --> 02:10:47.16 A little bit of conversation over the next, you know, couple months.
02:10:47.16 --> 02:10:50.16 And then I knew I was going to Maine.
02:10:50.16 --> 02:10:52.16 You, you, you, you, you kept.
02:10:52.16 --> 02:10:53.16 I got to ask you something now.
02:10:53.16 --> 02:10:56.16 You know, you, you, you're coming to Maine.
02:10:56.16 --> 02:10:58.16 I knew you were coming to Maine.
02:10:58.16 --> 02:11:01.16 Neither of us, like, we didn't text back and forth until the last minute.
02:11:01.16 --> 02:11:04.16 Because I knew the date you were coming to Maine.
02:11:04.16 --> 02:11:05.16 Uh huh.
02:11:05.16 --> 02:11:12.16 Did you, were you planning on a meeting when you came to Maine the whole time?
02:11:12.16 --> 02:11:14.16 I definitely knew we needed to meet.
02:11:14.16 --> 02:11:15.16 Yeah.
02:11:15.16 --> 02:11:16.16 Yeah.
02:11:16.16 --> 02:11:19.16 He's like, you were icing me.
02:11:19.16 --> 02:11:21.16 You put me on the ice, dude.
02:11:21.16 --> 02:11:24.16 I thought I was putting you on ice.
02:11:24.16 --> 02:11:27.16 We were both on ice.
02:11:27.16 --> 02:11:28.16 Yeah.
02:11:28.16 --> 02:11:31.16 So that was an, that was like the meeting.
02:11:31.16 --> 02:11:32.16 Awesome.
02:11:32.16 --> 02:11:34.16 We met up in Portland.
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:35.16 Uh, we had dinner.
02:11:35.16 --> 02:11:37.16 We actually both brought our wives.
02:11:37.16 --> 02:11:41.16 And I, my wife is always too busy to do anything business-wise with her.
02:11:41.16 --> 02:11:45.16 So she was super stoked to even be around and meet Amanda and everything.
02:11:45.16 --> 02:11:47.16 And, you know, you, we sat there.
02:11:47.16 --> 02:11:50.16 Our wives don't even know what they were doing because I would just end it up.
02:11:50.16 --> 02:11:52.16 We were getting so cold.
02:11:52.16 --> 02:11:56.16 And, and at the end of the night, we figured out.
02:11:56.16 --> 02:11:59.16 And we were doing this.
02:11:59.16 --> 02:12:00.16 And we shook hands.
02:12:00.16 --> 02:12:01.16 And, and I knew right there.
02:12:01.16 --> 02:12:02.16 We were good.
02:12:02.16 --> 02:12:04.16 We, we, we crafted the deal that was awesome.
02:12:04.16 --> 02:12:05.16 Yep.
02:12:05.16 --> 02:12:06.16 It was awesome for both of us.
02:12:06.16 --> 02:12:08.16 It was awesome for everything that both of us won.
02:12:08.16 --> 02:12:09.16 Which Eve.
02:12:09.16 --> 02:12:12.16 And it, it, it, it turned into not even both of us.
02:12:12.16 --> 02:12:13.16 It's just turned into us.
02:12:13.16 --> 02:12:14.16 Exactly.
02:12:14.16 --> 02:12:15.16 And that was awesome.
02:12:15.16 --> 02:12:18.16 And I think one of the best like lessons.
02:12:18.16 --> 02:12:21.16 Learn from.
02:12:21.16 --> 02:12:23.16 From you, what is.
02:12:23.16 --> 02:12:25.16 Just an incredible opportunity.
02:12:25.16 --> 02:12:33.16 The deal is making sure that you're both getting what you want and you're both a little bit uncomfortable.
02:12:33.16 --> 02:12:38.16 So that you continue to.
02:12:38.16 --> 02:12:44.16 Feel a little bit of the struggle to make sure you can take it over the goal line.
02:12:44.16 --> 02:12:45.16 Right.
02:12:45.16 --> 02:12:46.16 You're too comfortable.
02:12:46.16 --> 02:12:48.16 You become complacent.
02:12:48.16 --> 02:12:51.16 Bite off a little more than you can chew.
02:12:51.16 --> 02:12:53.16 And you're going to be chewing for much longer.
02:12:53.16 --> 02:12:56.16 So that's, that's something that was important.
02:12:56.16 --> 02:12:57.16 It was awesome.
02:12:57.16 --> 02:12:58.16 Yeah.
02:12:58.16 --> 02:12:59.16 And so just so everyone knows.
02:12:59.16 --> 02:13:02.16 I mean, I've been saying it like, we're partners.
02:13:02.16 --> 02:13:09.16 You know, we're partners with, with the podcast and what, what echo and I've been doing for the last a couple years.
02:13:09.16 --> 02:13:18.16 And what, what has been, has been doing for the last five years, seven years, five, five years, five, five years, five, five, six years, six years.
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:31.16 And, and at the end of the night when we got done eating our stakes in Portland, Maine, we show cans and this whole, you know, you've described it as like a perfect storm, which is what it feels like to me.
02:13:31.16 --> 02:13:33.16 It is a house-borne and glossy.
02:13:33.16 --> 02:13:34.16 There you go.
02:13:34.16 --> 02:13:35.16 It is the perfect storm.
02:13:35.16 --> 02:13:37.16 We are the perfect storm.
02:13:37.16 --> 02:13:38.16 Yeah.
02:13:38.16 --> 02:13:44.16 And so that's what's going on is that, you know, now we've got this.
02:13:44.16 --> 02:13:57.16 And we join forces and that we, we both complement each other's, you know, in terms of our business, we complement each other's weaknesses, in terms of our personalities, we complement each other's weaknesses.
02:13:57.16 --> 02:14:02.16 And we're, and the best part about it is the whole time that we're doing it.
02:14:02.16 --> 02:14:05.16 We're actually laughing our asses off at each other.
02:14:05.16 --> 02:14:08.16 It's a great time, which is, which is what it's all about.
02:14:08.16 --> 02:14:10.16 So that's what we're hot.
02:14:10.16 --> 02:14:11.16 That's why we're here.
02:14:11.16 --> 02:14:12.16 By the way.
02:14:12.16 --> 02:14:12.16 Yeah.
02:14:12.16 --> 02:14:13.16 That's why we're here.
02:14:13.16 --> 02:14:19.16 By the way, it farming to me in the origin factory 20,000 square feet.
02:14:19.16 --> 02:14:22.16 We're going to end up with how many employees in here.
02:14:22.16 --> 02:14:24.16 In a year, how many employees we're going to have in here?
02:14:24.16 --> 02:14:26.16 Oh, probably in a year.
02:14:26.16 --> 02:14:27.16 I don't know, 30, 40, 50.
02:14:27.16 --> 02:14:30.16 I mean, somewhere in there, you know, between 30 and 50.
02:14:30.16 --> 02:14:31.16 That's in a year.
02:14:31.16 --> 02:14:34.16 But remember, this is a start.
02:14:34.16 --> 02:14:37.16 We're starting.
02:14:37.16 --> 02:14:40.16 And so in five years, we're going to have a lot of people.
02:14:40.16 --> 02:14:44.16 Oh, yeah, we're in people ask, what are you going to make?
02:14:44.16 --> 02:14:45.16 Everything.
02:14:45.16 --> 02:14:48.16 And I say, we're going to make everything.
02:14:48.16 --> 02:14:57.16 Everything that I use in my life, I want it made here in America from the shorts to the hats.
02:14:57.16 --> 02:14:58.16 Everything.
02:14:58.16 --> 02:15:01.16 And that's what we're going to do.
02:15:01.16 --> 02:15:03.16 Beenies.
02:15:03.16 --> 02:15:06.16 Uh, probably pants, bigger pants.
02:15:06.16 --> 02:15:07.16 You know what?
02:15:07.16 --> 02:15:09.16 How is that a store the other day?
02:15:09.16 --> 02:15:14.16 Uh, you know, like a hardware store, but a big one, where they sell work clothes.
02:15:14.16 --> 02:15:19.16 And I said to myself, you know, let's just, because obviously I'm thinking about this all the time now.
02:15:19.16 --> 02:15:21.16 You know, it's hard to look at work clothes.
02:15:21.16 --> 02:15:26.16 And you say, of course, American workers, they would want to wear American made clothes.
02:15:26.16 --> 02:15:28.16 Where are these clothes made?
02:15:28.16 --> 02:15:29.16 They're not made here.
02:15:29.16 --> 02:15:30.16 They're not made in America.
02:15:30.16 --> 02:15:32.16 They're not made by American hands.
02:15:32.16 --> 02:15:36.16 So I think we're going to be going to take no prisoner scenario.
02:15:36.16 --> 02:15:38.16 And we're going to do it after it.
02:15:38.16 --> 02:15:41.16 Or not just kind of take no prisoner.
02:15:41.16 --> 02:15:44.16 We're going to chase the big dogs.
02:15:44.16 --> 02:15:46.16 Look out.
02:15:46.16 --> 02:15:47.16 Look out.
02:15:47.16 --> 02:15:49.16 Listen and look out.
02:15:49.16 --> 02:15:52.16 And that's not, that's not like an ego thing.
02:15:52.16 --> 02:15:53.16 That's a truth.
02:15:53.16 --> 02:15:54.16 Yeah.
02:15:54.16 --> 02:15:56.16 Listen and look out.
02:15:56.16 --> 02:15:57.16 Yeah.
02:15:57.16 --> 02:16:05.16 And like I said, today, when you, when you rekindle the fire of manufacturing and the, you rekindle,
02:16:05.16 --> 02:16:09.16 I mean, just talking to talking to the employees here.
02:16:09.16 --> 02:16:11.16 This is what they want to do.
02:16:11.16 --> 02:16:14.16 100% and this is what they made to do.
02:16:14.16 --> 02:16:15.16 That's right.
02:16:15.16 --> 02:16:18.16 And like you said, they want to take these things and build them with their hands.
02:16:18.16 --> 02:16:19.16 You've got it.
02:16:19.16 --> 02:16:22.16 And that opportunity has been taken away in the last 25 years.
02:16:22.16 --> 02:16:24.16 And we're bringing it back.
02:16:24.16 --> 02:16:25.16 And that is awesome.
02:16:25.16 --> 02:16:26.16 Appreciate that.
02:16:26.16 --> 02:16:28.16 Glad to have you as part of it.
02:16:28.16 --> 02:16:30.16 Awesome.
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:33.16 That's what we did echo Charles.
02:16:33.16 --> 02:16:34.16 Right.
02:16:34.16 --> 02:16:36.16 My brother.
02:16:36.16 --> 02:16:39.16 Speaking of what we do.
02:16:39.16 --> 02:16:40.16 Sure.
02:16:40.16 --> 02:16:43.16 Why don't you do what you do?
02:16:43.16 --> 02:16:44.16 I have a question.
02:16:44.16 --> 02:16:46.16 After you ask a question.
02:16:46.16 --> 02:16:49.16 Do you find it?
02:16:49.16 --> 02:16:55.16 Poledic that the origin logo is that circle.
02:16:55.16 --> 02:16:59.16 Remember when you're getting shit from the politicians.
02:16:59.16 --> 02:17:00.16 That's funny.
02:17:00.16 --> 02:17:01.16 You never thought about that.
02:17:01.16 --> 02:17:05.16 And now you have an origin logo that's a circle.
02:17:05.16 --> 02:17:06.16 It is.
02:17:06.16 --> 02:17:09.16 So that kind of in and of itself is like a circle.
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:09.16 Yeah.
02:17:09.16 --> 02:17:11.16 Actually, it is a wave.
02:17:11.16 --> 02:17:13.16 It's actually like a rip curl wave.
02:17:13.16 --> 02:17:14.16 Is that what that logo is?
02:17:14.16 --> 02:17:17.16 It's the flow.
02:17:17.16 --> 02:17:19.16 Did you do too flow?
02:17:19.16 --> 02:17:20.16 The surf flow.
02:17:20.16 --> 02:17:21.16 It's a wave.
02:17:21.16 --> 02:17:22.16 It's what that is.
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:24.16 It's breaking symbolic.
02:17:24.16 --> 02:17:25.16 It's what it's calling.
02:17:25.16 --> 02:17:27.16 I was going to say ironic, but that's not ironic.
02:17:27.16 --> 02:17:29.16 No symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic.
02:17:29.16 --> 02:17:31.16 So yeah.
02:17:31.16 --> 02:17:34.16 I don't even remember who that politician was.
02:17:34.16 --> 02:17:35.16 Doesn't matter.
02:17:35.16 --> 02:17:36.16 Nope.
02:17:36.16 --> 02:17:37.16 They're going to know that origin symbol.
02:17:37.16 --> 02:17:39.16 I'm going to try.
02:17:39.16 --> 02:17:41.16 In the industry.
02:17:41.16 --> 02:17:43.16 We call that layers.
02:17:43.16 --> 02:17:44.16 True story.
02:17:44.16 --> 02:17:45.16 Anyway, speaking of layers.
02:17:45.16 --> 02:17:46.16 Got it.
02:17:46.16 --> 02:17:48.16 And support, by the way.

02:18:02.16 --> 02:18:05.16 From the beginning, people ask what's the key to get?
02:18:05.16 --> 02:18:06.16 We know.
02:18:06.16 --> 02:18:07.16 We know now.
02:18:07.16 --> 02:18:08.16 100%.
02:18:08.16 --> 02:18:09.16 100%.
02:18:09.16 --> 02:18:10.16 100%.
02:18:10.16 --> 02:18:12.16 You know, you have like a hierarchy.
02:18:12.16 --> 02:18:13.16 Yeah.

02:19:30.16 --> 02:19:31.16 The merchandise side.
02:19:31.16 --> 02:19:36.16 And I do believe that it might be a little bit more work on pizza and compared to on my end.
02:19:36.16 --> 02:19:37.16 A little bit.
02:19:37.16 --> 02:19:42.16 But hey, I don't know from a, from a, if you go from like the level that you're currently cruising out,

02:19:54.16 --> 02:19:55.16 But just shorts.
02:19:55.16 --> 02:19:56.16 You know, a peril.
02:19:56.16 --> 02:20:00.92 Everything is, you know, our t-shirts are knit like we have a partner that knits, knits all the
02:20:00.92 --> 02:20:04.68 fabric, like six hours away or something.
02:20:04.68 --> 02:20:07.16 Everything's, everything's sourced and made here.
02:20:07.16 --> 02:20:11.96 You know, when we make all our own compression of peril, like cutting so and sublimate,
02:20:11.96 --> 02:20:13.16 die sublimation, everything.
02:20:13.16 --> 02:20:15.16 You say compression of peril.
02:20:15.16 --> 02:20:16.16 Yeah.
02:20:16.16 --> 02:20:17.16 I still call the rashguard.
02:20:17.16 --> 02:20:18.16 It's a rashguard.
02:20:18.16 --> 02:20:19.16 I know.
02:20:19.16 --> 02:20:20.16 I'm just, you know what I say compression of them.
02:20:20.16 --> 02:20:21.16 Yeah.
02:20:21.16 --> 02:20:22.16 Because I know it's not just the rashguard or rashguard is for surfing.
02:20:22.16 --> 02:20:22.16 Right.
02:20:22.16 --> 02:20:25.16 But, but, but, but, like the, like, the pants.
02:20:25.16 --> 02:20:26.16 The pants.
02:20:26.16 --> 02:20:27.16 The pants.
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:28.16 They're calling it in the jujitsu community.
02:20:28.16 --> 02:20:30.16 Don't we still say, yeah, I got a new rashguard.
02:20:30.16 --> 02:20:31.16 Oh, yeah.
02:20:31.16 --> 02:20:32.16 We still say.
02:20:32.16 --> 02:20:33.16 I'm just making sure.
02:20:33.16 --> 02:20:34.16 Yeah.
02:20:34.16 --> 02:20:37.16 Because I wasn't like hearing someone at the gym saying, like, did you check out this new compression?
02:20:37.16 --> 02:20:40.16 But in the wake room, there is, they do say that.
02:20:40.16 --> 02:20:41.16 Yeah.
02:20:41.16 --> 02:20:42.16 Because I, right.
02:20:42.16 --> 02:20:43.16 I see like in football.
02:20:43.16 --> 02:20:44.16 Yeah.
02:20:44.16 --> 02:20:47.16 Like you'll see some company that's advertising compression.
02:20:47.16 --> 02:20:48.16 Yeah.
02:20:48.16 --> 02:20:49.16 Yeah.
02:20:49.16 --> 02:20:50.16 Yeah.
02:20:50.16 --> 02:20:51.16 Exactly.
02:20:51.16 --> 02:20:52.16 But it's not, it's not on me.
02:20:52.16 --> 02:20:57.16 You got to remember like every textiles different than what you used to, like, like, the
02:20:57.16 --> 02:21:03.16 Warpwick we use our our textile for the rashguard or tits or whatever else.
02:21:03.16 --> 02:21:04.16 It's different.
02:21:04.16 --> 02:21:06.16 And you just called them tites.
02:21:06.16 --> 02:21:07.16 I did because spats.
02:21:07.16 --> 02:21:09.16 I have no idea what a spat is.
02:21:09.16 --> 02:21:11.16 I'm just going to say out in California.
02:21:11.16 --> 02:21:13.16 It's definitely called spats.
02:21:13.16 --> 02:21:14.16 Yeah.
02:21:14.16 --> 02:21:16.16 And I don't even know where that word comes from.
02:21:16.16 --> 02:21:17.16 Brought spats.
02:21:17.16 --> 02:21:19.16 I knew spats is when you tape your ankles.
02:21:19.16 --> 02:21:20.16 It's a spat around the fleet.
02:21:20.16 --> 02:21:21.16 Yeah.
02:21:21.16 --> 02:21:22.16 You spat your legs.
02:21:22.16 --> 02:21:23.16 But why did they even cut that?
02:21:23.16 --> 02:21:24.16 I bet you.
02:21:24.16 --> 02:21:25.16 I bet you.
02:21:25.16 --> 02:21:26.16 Wait.
02:21:26.16 --> 02:21:28.16 Did the spats go down your leg?
02:21:28.16 --> 02:21:29.16 Like tights and then around your foot.
02:21:29.16 --> 02:21:30.16 It was just tape over.
02:21:30.16 --> 02:21:32.16 You know, it just crinkles.
02:21:32.16 --> 02:21:34.16 But instead of your ankles under your socks.
02:21:34.16 --> 02:21:35.16 Yeah.
02:21:35.16 --> 02:21:36.16 Yeah.
02:21:36.16 --> 02:21:37.16 tape over.
02:21:37.16 --> 02:21:38.16 Over.
02:21:38.16 --> 02:21:39.16 You shoe over everything.
02:21:39.16 --> 02:21:40.16 Which is trainer stop doing because it's.
02:21:40.16 --> 02:21:41.16 So why don't we call him compression.
02:21:41.16 --> 02:21:42.16 I tell him this cool.
02:21:42.16 --> 02:21:43.16 Yeah.
02:21:43.16 --> 02:21:47.16 Because I'm going to be, you know, earlier we got kind of like wrapped around or we got
02:21:47.16 --> 02:21:52.16 a side track about me being sensitive about something or not being sensitive.
02:21:52.16 --> 02:21:53.16 Tights.
02:21:53.16 --> 02:21:54.16 You're not down for time.
02:21:54.16 --> 02:21:55.16 As a dude.
02:21:55.16 --> 02:21:56.16 Right.
02:21:56.16 --> 02:21:57.16 Don't wear it.
02:21:57.16 --> 02:21:58.16 We're not wearing tights.
02:21:58.16 --> 02:21:59.16 Yeah.
02:21:59.16 --> 02:22:00.16 Compression pants.
02:22:00.16 --> 02:22:01.16 That's a good compression shirt.
02:22:01.16 --> 02:22:02.16 See.
02:22:02.16 --> 02:22:03.16 There you go.
02:22:03.16 --> 02:22:04.16 Compression shirt.
02:22:04.16 --> 02:22:05.16 And rash pants.
02:22:05.16 --> 02:22:06.16 Rashed guard pants.
02:22:06.16 --> 02:22:07.16 That doesn't make sense either.
02:22:07.16 --> 02:22:08.16 Doesn't.
02:22:08.16 --> 02:22:09.16 Even though they do prevent rashes.
02:22:09.16 --> 02:22:10.16 Just see if you're sure.
02:22:10.16 --> 02:22:12.16 Or do you do it to that burn?
02:22:12.16 --> 02:22:13.16 Okay.
02:22:13.16 --> 02:22:16.16 You know why people, you know why a lot of people wear compression pants and compression shirts.
02:22:16.16 --> 02:22:17.16 Injuditsu.
02:22:17.16 --> 02:22:20.16 The prevention of the disease.
02:22:20.16 --> 02:22:21.16 The funk.
02:22:21.16 --> 02:22:22.16 Yeah.
02:22:22.16 --> 02:22:23.16 Right.
02:22:23.16 --> 02:22:24.16 They don't want the hanghorm.
02:22:24.16 --> 02:22:25.16 Right.
02:22:25.16 --> 02:22:26.16 They don't want that hanghorm.
02:22:26.16 --> 02:22:28.16 They don't want, you know, whatever.
02:22:28.16 --> 02:22:29.16 Very immersive.
02:22:29.16 --> 02:22:31.16 That's what people wear that.
02:22:31.16 --> 02:22:32.16 And you know.
02:22:32.16 --> 02:22:36.16 The people that I know that wear it, they seem to believe in it.
02:22:36.16 --> 02:22:37.16 Oh, yeah.
02:22:37.16 --> 02:22:39.16 Just the level of it's not like a.
02:22:39.16 --> 02:22:41.16 Like the, what's the sun protection?
02:22:41.16 --> 02:22:42.16 Right.
02:22:42.16 --> 02:22:43.16 That's 50.
02:22:43.16 --> 02:22:44.16 Or yeah.
02:22:44.16 --> 02:22:45.16 So you, you pf, you pf.
02:22:45.16 --> 02:22:46.16 Right.
02:22:46.16 --> 02:22:47.16 You pf 50.
02:22:47.16 --> 02:22:50.16 There's no anti ringworm percentage rating.
02:22:50.16 --> 02:22:51.16 Right.
02:22:51.16 --> 02:22:52.16 Right.
02:22:52.16 --> 02:22:54.16 There's just the general anti microbeal.
02:22:54.16 --> 02:22:55.16 Right.
02:22:55.16 --> 02:22:59.16 Like, but that keeps it from growing in the material.
02:22:59.16 --> 02:23:05.16 What I'm saying is if you wear like a compression shirt and compression pants,
02:23:05.16 --> 02:23:06.16 Sure.
02:23:06.16 --> 02:23:10.16 Then you're not rubbing your skin against some savage that came into the gym with ringworm.
02:23:10.16 --> 02:23:11.16 Right.
02:23:11.16 --> 02:23:12.16 So you have less percentage.
02:23:12.16 --> 02:23:13.16 Or rolling with him too.
02:23:13.16 --> 02:23:14.16 Yeah.
02:23:14.16 --> 02:23:15.16 You don't need that.
02:23:15.16 --> 02:23:16.16 So you don't want that time.
02:23:16.16 --> 02:23:21.16 That's a good reason to wear compression gear.
02:23:21.16 --> 02:23:22.16 Cross the board.
02:23:22.16 --> 02:23:23.16 And the rash cards.
02:23:23.16 --> 02:23:24.16 Right.
02:23:24.16 --> 02:23:25.16 Like they're.
02:23:25.16 --> 02:23:29.16 Now they're not like the rash cards you're used to.
02:23:29.16 --> 02:23:36.16 The ones you put on and then they on talk and then you talk to me and they on talk and you talk to me and they're designed to stay tucked in.
02:23:36.16 --> 02:23:41.16 So you put them on and the way the fibers flex and bend with your body.
02:23:41.16 --> 02:23:46.16 It's not your mother's or grandma's rash card.
02:23:46.16 --> 02:23:50.16 So when you say tucked in because you don't really tuck in a rash card, right?
02:23:50.16 --> 02:23:51.16 Or do you.
02:23:51.16 --> 02:23:53.16 You're talking about under the gear.
02:23:53.16 --> 02:23:54.16 Yeah.
02:23:54.16 --> 02:23:55.16 Oh, yeah.
02:23:55.16 --> 02:23:56.16 Yeah.
02:23:56.16 --> 02:23:57.16 That's a whole new world.
02:23:57.16 --> 02:23:58.16 Yeah.
02:23:58.16 --> 02:24:00.16 Some places make you wear rash card under your gear.
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:01.16 Yeah.
02:24:01.16 --> 02:24:03.16 I think it's good to have a rash card under your gear.
02:24:03.16 --> 02:24:04.16 I know a lot of people think that.
02:24:04.16 --> 02:24:05.16 It's not traditional.
02:24:05.16 --> 02:24:07.16 I mean, I'm just reddish.
02:24:07.16 --> 02:24:08.16 Yeah.
02:24:08.16 --> 02:24:09.16 It's not like what you like.
02:24:09.16 --> 02:24:11.16 I like the barrier.
02:24:11.16 --> 02:24:13.16 I like the I like the g-
02:24:13.16 --> 02:24:16.16 The rash or the I like the barrier.
02:24:16.16 --> 02:24:19.16 Between the the fabric and the skin.
02:24:19.16 --> 02:24:22.16 I like the compression because you compression muscle.
02:24:22.16 --> 02:24:24.16 You get more use.
02:24:24.16 --> 02:24:26.16 You're straight performance performance.

02:24:27.16 --> 02:24:28.16 Absolutely.
02:24:28.16 --> 02:24:33.16 The g-slides a little bit better on a rash card than it does your skin once it's all sweaty up and sticky.
02:24:33.16 --> 02:24:34.16 Right.
02:24:34.16 --> 02:24:35.16 So that's why you use it.
02:24:35.16 --> 02:24:37.16 And I'm a hairy creek.
02:24:37.16 --> 02:24:39.16 No one's the chest hair.

02:30:19.16 --> 02:30:20.16 Yes.
02:30:20.16 --> 02:30:21.16 Why is that?
02:30:21.16 --> 02:30:23.16 I mean, lots of reasons.
02:30:23.16 --> 02:30:26.16 You're more flexible, better positioning.
02:30:26.16 --> 02:30:30.16 Better escapes because it's less mass burning less oxygen.
02:30:30.16 --> 02:30:32.16 Because you have less muscle mass.
02:30:32.16 --> 02:30:40.16 And for me, I would wear the 285 version of myself out.
02:30:40.16 --> 02:30:41.16 Right.
02:30:41.16 --> 02:30:43.16 So it's, I stop.
02:30:43.16 --> 02:30:45.16 And I love lifting weights.
02:30:45.16 --> 02:30:47.16 I love lifting weights.
02:30:47.16 --> 02:30:50.16 But for me, you do two fulfills the void because it is resistance.
02:30:50.16 --> 02:30:52.16 You're always working.
02:30:52.16 --> 02:30:53.16 I never feel out of shape.
02:30:53.16 --> 02:30:56.16 Well, unless I have too many will be pies.
02:30:56.16 --> 02:30:57.16 What?
02:30:57.16 --> 02:30:59.16 Did you do anything to work out besides GJ2?
02:30:59.16 --> 02:31:00.16 No.
02:31:00.16 --> 02:31:01.16 Do you run?
02:31:01.16 --> 02:31:02.16 Do you sprint?
02:31:02.16 --> 02:31:03.16 No.
02:31:03.16 --> 02:31:05.16 Just pure GJ2.
02:31:05.16 --> 02:31:07.16 I do Dean Mr. tells me that.
02:31:07.16 --> 02:31:08.16 Yeah.
02:31:08.16 --> 02:31:11.16 When Dean Mr. doesn't want to work out, doesn't want to do any, you know,
02:31:11.16 --> 02:31:12.16 sprints.
02:31:12.16 --> 02:31:14.16 He's like, man, I get it from GJ2.
02:31:14.16 --> 02:31:16.16 That's what I'm best thing.
02:31:16.16 --> 02:31:18.16 So now you're supporting his argument.
02:31:18.16 --> 02:31:20.16 Now I get it. Now I got to deal with that.
02:31:20.16 --> 02:31:22.16 Would you be Robert said, you know,
02:31:22.16 --> 02:31:23.16 What is that?
02:31:23.16 --> 02:31:25.16 Well, we'll talk about some day.
02:31:25.16 --> 02:31:27.16 How GJ2 makes you unathletic.
02:31:27.16 --> 02:31:28.16 Oh, really?
02:31:28.16 --> 02:31:29.16 That's a whole other talk.
02:31:29.16 --> 02:31:30.16 Interesting.
02:31:30.16 --> 02:31:35.16 And I have facts on why it makes you unathletic.
02:31:35.16 --> 02:31:38.16 What it keeps you, it keeps your body together.
02:31:38.16 --> 02:31:39.16 You're caught together.
02:31:39.16 --> 02:31:40.16 You're muscle strong.
02:31:40.16 --> 02:31:42.16 So what does it do to make you unathletic?
02:31:42.16 --> 02:31:43.16 It's slow movement.
02:31:43.16 --> 02:31:44.16 You slow.
02:31:44.16 --> 02:31:45.16 You start when you start GJ2.
02:31:45.16 --> 02:31:46.16 Your body slows down.
02:31:46.16 --> 02:31:48.16 Your mind slows down. Your muscle slowed down.
02:31:48.16 --> 02:31:52.16 Whatever you had for fast twitch turns the slow twitch because you're pulling and
02:31:52.16 --> 02:31:54.16 tugging and you're moving slow.
02:31:54.16 --> 02:31:56.16 I used to be able to dunk a basketball.
02:31:56.16 --> 02:31:58.16 So every dunk can touch the rim now.
02:31:58.16 --> 02:32:00.16 I think we need to.
02:32:00.16 --> 02:32:06.16 I will go ahead and defend the GJ2 over here on my side of the table.
02:32:06.16 --> 02:32:12.16 Because if you continue to do cleans and you continue to squat.
02:32:12.16 --> 02:32:13.16 Yeah.
02:32:13.16 --> 02:32:19.16 And you continue to sprint and mobility drills and agility drills.
02:32:19.16 --> 02:32:21.16 You can keep that athleticism.
02:32:21.16 --> 02:32:22.16 I think you're right.
02:32:22.16 --> 02:32:23.16 I know you're right.
02:32:23.16 --> 02:32:24.16 Jack.
02:32:24.16 --> 02:32:26.16 That's what I did when I competed.
02:32:26.16 --> 02:32:27.16 I had a strength in conditioning.
02:32:27.16 --> 02:32:28.16 Oh, yeah.
02:32:28.16 --> 02:32:30.16 Sprint lift push pull.
02:32:30.16 --> 02:32:33.16 So I guess big picture is one of those deals where it kind of
02:32:33.16 --> 02:32:38.16 confirms the idea that you don't have to be athletic to do good in GJ2.
02:32:38.16 --> 02:32:40.16 Generally speaking,
02:32:40.16 --> 02:32:43.16 but if you want to do some kind of athletic competition,
02:32:43.16 --> 02:32:46.16 including but not limited to GJ2,
02:32:46.16 --> 02:32:48.16 it helps to be athletic.
02:32:48.16 --> 02:32:49.16 Jack's a material.
02:32:49.16 --> 02:32:50.16 Yeah.
02:32:50.16 --> 02:32:53.16 I'm kind of glad that you kind of hit him with that because when I said I stopped doing
02:32:53.16 --> 02:32:56.16 like legs and stuff like that, I got a lot of crap for it.
02:32:56.16 --> 02:32:57.16 Yeah.
02:32:57.16 --> 02:33:01.16 You know, I did a lot of squats and college.
02:33:01.16 --> 02:33:02.16 Yeah.
02:33:02.16 --> 02:33:03.16 You put all college football.
02:33:03.16 --> 02:33:04.16 Hell yeah.
02:33:04.16 --> 02:33:06.16 I'm scared of them.
02:33:06.16 --> 02:33:08.16 I like hacksquats.
02:33:08.16 --> 02:33:10.16 Man, for sure.
02:33:10.16 --> 02:33:11.16 You got bad knees or something?
02:33:11.16 --> 02:33:12.16 Bad back.
02:33:12.16 --> 02:33:13.16 Bad back.
02:33:13.16 --> 02:33:14.16 Yeah.
02:33:14.16 --> 02:33:17.16 That last time I squatted and I hit the floor, right?
02:33:17.16 --> 02:33:19.16 Of course, bad back.
02:33:19.16 --> 02:33:24.16 Bad back from years of major and personal question.
02:33:24.16 --> 02:33:32.16 Does your ego not allow you to get in there and do 185 pounds for some higher reps?
02:33:32.16 --> 02:33:33.16 Nope.
02:33:33.16 --> 02:33:34.16 I do that 100%.
02:33:34.16 --> 02:33:35.16 But you still don't like it.
02:33:35.16 --> 02:33:36.16 I do hacksquats.
02:33:36.16 --> 02:33:38.16 I still don't like it.
02:33:38.16 --> 02:33:39.16 But I mean, it's.
02:33:39.16 --> 02:33:44.16 Steel is great.
02:33:44.16 --> 02:33:44.16 Yeah.
02:33:44.16 --> 02:33:45.16 That's the bottom line.
02:33:45.16 --> 02:33:46.16 Yeah.
02:33:46.16 --> 02:33:47.16 It is great.
02:33:47.16 --> 02:33:49.16 I just get a 2-JJ2 man.
02:33:49.16 --> 02:33:50.16 I push.
02:33:50.16 --> 02:33:54.16 I do, you know, every time I step on the mats, it's 6-10 minutes rounds and I train to the break.
02:33:54.16 --> 02:33:55.16 So I'm doing 12 minute rounds.
02:33:55.16 --> 02:33:56.16 Nice.
02:33:56.16 --> 02:33:57.16 I make sure to get six.
02:33:57.16 --> 02:33:58.16 Yeah.
02:33:58.16 --> 02:34:01.16 And I get it as things free up.
02:34:01.16 --> 02:34:05.16 And my son wants to lift as he starts the summer.
02:34:05.16 --> 02:34:06.16 I'll get in with him.
02:34:06.16 --> 02:34:07.16 Yeah.
02:34:07.16 --> 02:34:08.16 And we'll press him higher.
02:34:08.16 --> 02:34:09.16 Yeah.
02:34:09.16 --> 02:34:10.16 Yeah.
02:34:10.16 --> 02:34:11.16 Yeah.
02:34:11.16 --> 02:34:12.16 That sounded pretty hard.
02:34:12.16 --> 02:34:13.16 He's all it.
02:34:13.16 --> 02:34:13.16 Yeah.
02:34:13.16 --> 02:34:15.16 If you want to go lift now, look at him.
02:34:15.16 --> 02:34:16.16 You want to go lift.
02:34:16.16 --> 02:34:17.16 Press him higher.
02:34:17.16 --> 02:34:19.16 But kettlebells don't get you that.
02:34:19.16 --> 02:34:22.16 I mean, I'm sure under certain circumstances, you will.
02:34:22.16 --> 02:34:24.16 But they keep your athletic.
02:34:24.16 --> 02:34:25.16 I think you'll.
02:34:25.16 --> 02:34:26.16 Yeah.
02:34:26.16 --> 02:34:26.16 I think you'll.
02:34:26.16 --> 02:34:27.16 Yeah.
02:34:27.16 --> 02:34:28.16 I think you'll.
02:34:28.16 --> 02:34:29.16 Yeah.
02:34:29.16 --> 02:34:30.16 Yeah.
02:34:30.16 --> 02:34:32.16 And the other big thing is when you.
02:34:32.16 --> 02:34:34.16 Like for a kettlebell snatch.
02:34:34.16 --> 02:34:37.16 And when you're swinging motion and when it gets to the top, you have to stop it.
02:34:37.16 --> 02:34:38.16 Right.
02:34:38.16 --> 02:34:39.16 Because otherwise, you're going to rip your shoulder out.
02:34:39.16 --> 02:34:40.16 So you have to use all this.
02:34:40.16 --> 02:34:42.16 Whatever that kind of muscle.
02:34:42.16 --> 02:34:43.16 What is it?
02:34:43.16 --> 02:34:44.16 Echo centric or something.
02:34:44.16 --> 02:34:45.16 What is it?
02:34:45.16 --> 02:34:46.16 Concentric.
02:34:46.16 --> 02:34:47.16 Whatever you got to do this.
02:34:47.16 --> 02:34:48.16 To stop it at the top.
02:34:48.16 --> 02:34:49.16 Yeah.
02:34:49.16 --> 02:34:50.16 You got to stop.
02:34:50.16 --> 02:34:53.16 It's using all these muscles to make that thing happen.
02:34:53.16 --> 02:34:54.16 That's cool.
02:34:54.16 --> 02:34:55.16 Yeah.
02:34:55.16 --> 02:34:56.16 Yeah.
02:34:56.16 --> 02:34:57.16 I want to do it.
02:34:57.16 --> 02:34:58.16 Yeah.
02:34:58.16 --> 02:34:59.16 It's cool.
02:34:59.16 --> 02:35:00.16 I got a chat on.
02:35:00.16 --> 02:35:01.16 It'll get fun.
02:35:01.16 --> 02:35:02.16 Yeah.
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:03.16 It's a moment.
02:35:03.16 --> 02:35:04.16 I've got to create a moment when you got a balance.
02:35:04.16 --> 02:35:05.16 It's like all this stuff.
02:35:05.16 --> 02:35:06.16 It's fun.
02:35:06.16 --> 02:35:07.16 It's fun.
02:35:07.16 --> 02:35:08.16 College.
02:35:08.16 --> 02:35:10.16 I said the true.
02:35:10.16 --> 02:35:13.16 True test of how strong somebody is is a hankling.
02:35:13.16 --> 02:35:14.16 Yeah.
02:35:14.16 --> 02:35:16.16 They said you could bench a lot.
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:17.16 You could squat.
02:35:17.16 --> 02:35:18.16 Yeah.
02:35:18.16 --> 02:35:19.16 There's a lot of people.
02:35:19.16 --> 02:35:20.16 Yeah.
02:35:20.16 --> 02:35:21.16 What is there's a lot of things that you could say.
02:35:21.16 --> 02:35:22.16 Like for instance.
02:35:22.16 --> 02:35:23.16 You know, it's a good one overhead squat.
02:35:23.16 --> 02:35:24.16 Oh, you got a great spot.
02:35:24.16 --> 02:35:25.16 It's back.
02:35:25.16 --> 02:35:31.16 If you got a guy that can do massive, big weight and or more medium weight high reps.
02:35:31.16 --> 02:35:32.16 Yeah.
02:35:32.16 --> 02:35:33.16 Yeah.
02:35:33.16 --> 02:35:35.16 But on an hankling, you got to use your speed also.
02:35:35.16 --> 02:35:37.16 It's a little bit explosive.
02:35:37.16 --> 02:35:39.16 So you could just go straight to the snatch.
02:35:39.16 --> 02:35:40.16 Yeah.
02:35:40.16 --> 02:35:41.16 Right.
02:35:41.16 --> 02:35:43.16 But then again, the snatch, you need the balance at the top.
02:35:43.16 --> 02:35:44.16 That's coordination.
02:35:44.16 --> 02:35:45.16 Yeah.
02:35:45.16 --> 02:35:46.16 And you know, all these things.
02:35:46.16 --> 02:35:48.16 So any depends on what you mean by strong too.
02:35:48.16 --> 02:35:53.16 So you know, like, I guess, you know, in certain circles, they cost strength, power
02:35:53.16 --> 02:35:54.16 and strength about two different things.
02:35:54.16 --> 02:35:55.16 And it's like, okay.
02:35:55.16 --> 02:35:56.16 So what are you talking to him?
02:35:56.16 --> 02:35:58.16 So I dig it and I agree actually.
02:35:58.16 --> 02:36:00.16 But this is also 20 years ago.
02:36:00.16 --> 02:36:01.16 Yeah, exactly right.
02:36:01.16 --> 02:36:04.16 If you're in another point to consider, you know, that's a really good change.
02:36:04.16 --> 02:36:05.16 Yeah.
02:36:05.16 --> 02:36:06.16 You agree.
02:36:06.16 --> 02:36:07.16 You said, hey, in clean right.
02:36:07.16 --> 02:36:08.16 Hey, in clean.
02:36:08.16 --> 02:36:10.16 Me is that's a real master.
02:36:10.16 --> 02:36:11.16 Yeah.
02:36:11.16 --> 02:36:12.16 The solid metric.
02:36:12.16 --> 02:36:13.16 Yeah.
02:36:13.16 --> 02:36:14.16 For sure.
02:36:14.16 --> 02:36:15.16 Deadlift another solid metric, by the way.
02:36:15.16 --> 02:36:16.16 Yeah.
02:36:16.16 --> 02:36:17.16 Raw strength.
02:36:17.16 --> 02:36:18.16 That's right.
02:36:18.16 --> 02:36:19.16 Yeah.
02:36:19.16 --> 02:36:19.16 Yeah.
02:36:19.16 --> 02:36:20.16 Yeah.
02:36:20.16 --> 02:36:23.16 Because consider, remember, by like, when you're a kid or maybe old school kind of philosophy,
02:36:23.16 --> 02:36:26.16 it's like, hey, you know, you get the old timer and you're like,
02:36:26.16 --> 02:36:27.16 how strong are you?
02:36:27.16 --> 02:36:28.16 And you're like, real strong.
02:36:28.16 --> 02:36:29.16 Okay.
02:36:29.16 --> 02:36:30.16 Pick that up.
02:36:30.16 --> 02:36:31.16 You know what I mean?
02:36:31.16 --> 02:36:32.16 Okay.
02:36:32.16 --> 02:36:33.16 You can pick it up.
02:36:33.16 --> 02:36:34.16 You're weak.
02:36:34.16 --> 02:36:35.16 You can pick it up.
02:36:35.16 --> 02:36:36.16 Yeah.
02:36:36.16 --> 02:36:38.16 And then the step two is pick it up over your head.
02:36:38.16 --> 02:36:39.16 You got that lift.
02:36:39.16 --> 02:36:40.16 You got lift.
02:36:40.16 --> 02:36:41.16 Yeah.
02:36:41.16 --> 02:36:42.16 Yeah.
02:36:42.16 --> 02:36:43.16 You don't lift.
02:36:43.16 --> 02:36:44.16 No.
02:36:44.16 --> 02:36:45.16 Just kidding.
02:36:45.16 --> 02:36:46.16 Yeah.
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:47.16 Do you want to do something?
02:36:47.16 --> 02:36:48.16 Let's not do that again.
02:36:48.16 --> 02:36:49.16 You got to get the fire.
02:36:49.16 --> 02:36:50.16 Yeah.
02:36:50.16 --> 02:36:51.16 Yeah.
02:36:51.16 --> 02:36:52.16 Yeah.
02:36:52.16 --> 02:36:53.16 Don't get you nuts with that though.
02:36:53.16 --> 02:36:54.16 Who's that?
02:36:54.16 --> 02:36:55.16 Who's just talking to somebody there?
02:36:55.16 --> 02:36:56.16 There are lots of deadlifts.
02:36:56.16 --> 02:36:57.16 It was Ed.
02:36:57.16 --> 02:36:58.16 Yeah.
02:36:58.16 --> 02:37:00.16 He was like, hey, you know, my back and stuff.
02:37:00.16 --> 02:37:02.16 I was like, don't get crazy with deadlifts.
02:37:02.16 --> 02:37:03.16 No.
02:37:03.16 --> 02:37:06.40 But you can talk to plenty of people that say, oh, I had a bad back.
02:37:06.40 --> 02:37:07.40 And I deadlifted it now.
02:37:07.40 --> 02:37:08.40 It's healed.
02:37:08.40 --> 02:37:09.40 Right.
02:37:09.40 --> 02:37:10.40 Right.
02:37:10.40 --> 02:37:11.40 Plenty of people say that.
02:37:11.40 --> 02:37:12.40 Absolutely.
02:37:12.40 --> 02:37:14.000 Crazy with them because it'll just give you good gems strength.
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.20 Like, your your backs bad because a lot of times anyway, even just anywhere in your
02:37:17.20 --> 02:37:21.08 core is because when you have like some core or the or your back or something, when you
02:37:21.08 --> 02:37:25.16 do stuff, you adjust to not use it, you know, so deadlift.
02:37:25.16 --> 02:37:26.16 Yeah.
02:37:26.16 --> 02:37:27.16 You're using it.
02:37:27.16 --> 02:37:29.72 So now when you do some thing, you're grabbing the cranberry juice from this side.
02:37:29.72 --> 02:37:30.72 You're going to put it over here.
02:37:30.72 --> 02:37:31.72 You had a bottle of floor.
02:37:31.72 --> 02:37:32.72 Yeah.
02:37:32.72 --> 02:37:33.72 You know, you're like, how did I do that?
02:37:33.72 --> 02:37:35.72 I just got it on a long cranberry juice.
02:37:35.72 --> 02:37:39.72 That's, that's your, that's your, that's your, that's your bottle bro.
02:37:39.72 --> 02:37:41.76 You shouldn't be that's your body's way of telling you.
02:37:41.76 --> 02:37:42.76 Don't want that.
02:37:42.76 --> 02:37:43.76 You're right.
02:37:43.76 --> 02:37:44.76 You're right.
02:37:44.76 --> 02:37:45.76 Yeah.
02:37:45.76 --> 02:37:46.76 Maybe you're grabbing it from here putting in the trash.
02:37:46.76 --> 02:37:49.76 I'm just saying that's why though.
02:37:49.76 --> 02:37:52.48 So you go deadlift, not heavy, not crazy.
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:54.28 Just like your body's like, like any lifting.
02:37:54.28 --> 02:37:55.96 It's like your body just getting used to it.
02:37:55.96 --> 02:37:57.76 So boom, you're used to picking stuff up.
02:37:57.76 --> 02:37:58.76 I'm going to try it.
02:37:58.76 --> 02:37:59.76 Do it.
02:37:59.76 --> 02:38:00.76 I like it.
02:38:00.76 --> 02:38:01.76 Try the kettlebells too.
02:38:01.76 --> 02:38:04.60 And if you want the cool ones, and when I say cool, it's like you look at them in
02:38:04.60 --> 02:38:05.60 their cool.
02:38:05.60 --> 02:38:06.60 Yeah.
02:38:06.60 --> 02:38:07.84 Like irrefutably cool on it.
02:38:07.84 --> 02:38:08.84 That's the ones.
02:38:08.84 --> 02:38:09.84 The gorilla one.
02:38:09.84 --> 02:38:11.16 Actually, they do the gorilla on the first one.
02:38:11.16 --> 02:38:12.48 Do the chimp one first.
02:38:12.48 --> 02:38:13.48 Yeah.
02:38:13.48 --> 02:38:16.20 They like, what does she about me that I'm straight to zombies?
02:38:16.20 --> 02:38:17.20 Yeah.
02:38:17.20 --> 02:38:18.20 We're just super strong.
02:38:18.20 --> 02:38:20.60 There's a, we have the same categories.
02:38:20.60 --> 02:38:21.60 Yeah.
02:38:21.60 --> 02:38:22.96 And I feel what they're all called.
02:38:22.96 --> 02:38:25.84 But like, when I look at the legend,
02:38:25.84 --> 02:38:27.04 versus the gorilla,
02:38:27.04 --> 02:38:27.56 yeah.
02:38:27.56 --> 02:38:29.24 ones or the primate ones,
02:38:29.24 --> 02:38:30.92 to the zombies.
02:38:30.92 --> 02:38:31.04 Yeah.
02:38:31.04 --> 02:38:32.68 I wanted the ones that look crazy and evil.
02:38:32.68 --> 02:38:33.04 Yeah.
02:38:33.04 --> 02:38:33.88 I guess that's no big shit.
02:38:33.88 --> 02:38:34.48 Makes sense.
02:38:34.48 --> 02:38:35.64 I had to cram points.
02:38:35.64 --> 02:38:35.84 Yeah.
02:38:35.84 --> 02:38:37.96 I think we both, we all hear collectively.
02:38:37.96 --> 02:38:39.40 No, why you want to zombies?
02:38:39.40 --> 02:38:43.84 Technically, it's so, but that brings up good point in my opinion.
02:38:43.84 --> 02:38:45.20 All the different categories,
02:38:45.20 --> 02:38:46.20 primal bells.
02:38:46.20 --> 02:38:49.68 That's the the chimp, the, you know, all the things,
02:38:49.68 --> 02:38:52.04 different zombies, all zombies, legends,
02:38:52.04 --> 02:38:56.000 where wolf, uh, cyclops, cyclops, like all the legends.
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.60 So boom, pick your category, but that's the cool ones.
02:38:58.60 --> 02:38:59.60 I recommend.
02:38:59.60 --> 02:39:00.20 What else?
02:39:00.20 --> 02:39:00.76 Check them out.
02:39:00.76 --> 02:39:01.60 Hey man.

02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:05.16 Actually, it's kind of good you go on there.
02:39:05.16 --> 02:39:07.04 And they have all kinds of workout stuff.
02:39:07.04 --> 02:39:09.64 Like stuff, you know how, but you know how when you get
02:39:09.64 --> 02:39:11.04 into a workout, maybe not you.
02:39:11.04 --> 02:39:14.52 You're not like this, but like I got into the kettle bells
02:39:14.52 --> 02:39:16.68 and it became fun, you know?
02:39:16.68 --> 02:39:18.56 You know how like, if something becomes fun,
02:39:18.56 --> 02:39:20.32 I stop doing it, do something that sucks.
02:39:20.32 --> 02:39:23.20 Well, bang this is more boring.
02:39:23.20 --> 02:39:24.40 What's psychological challenge?
02:39:24.40 --> 02:39:25.08 She's huge.
02:39:25.08 --> 02:39:27.30 But they got all kinds of like the maces and you know
02:39:27.30 --> 02:39:28.44 all the workout stuff, whatever.
02:39:28.44 --> 02:39:30.48 Anyway, that's a good one on it.com slash jockel,
02:39:30.48 --> 02:39:33.04 check out that stuff and man get after it.

02:39:37.76 --> 02:39:38.60 I'll recommend.
02:39:38.60 --> 02:39:39.12 Awesome.
02:39:39.12 --> 02:39:42.64 Also, if you like these books,
02:39:42.64 --> 02:39:43.92 peep didn't write a book, wait,
02:39:43.92 --> 02:39:45.64 do have you written a book before?
02:39:45.64 --> 02:39:48.20 No, I wouldn't be so proud of that.
02:39:48.20 --> 02:39:50.44 I wrote a long ass paper.
02:39:50.44 --> 02:39:51.76 Yeah.
02:39:51.76 --> 02:39:54.16 Well, I couldn't sleep over the last year, but
02:39:54.16 --> 02:39:55.000 yeah.
02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.16 So yeah, a little bit different.
02:39:57.16 --> 02:39:58.36 But anyway, a lot of times,
02:39:58.36 --> 02:40:01.04 jockel will review books on this podcast.
02:40:01.04 --> 02:40:02.92 People like to get them.

02:40:19.08 --> 02:40:20.88 small action, big reaction.
02:40:20.88 --> 02:40:21.68 Nice.
02:40:21.68 --> 02:40:24.24 Also, subscribe to the podcast.
02:40:24.24 --> 02:40:26.04 Mm.
02:40:26.04 --> 02:40:27.12 Google Play.
02:40:27.12 --> 02:40:29.12 We still feel the need to say that.
02:40:29.12 --> 02:40:29.48 Yeah.
02:40:29.48 --> 02:40:31.48 Because what?
02:40:31.48 --> 02:40:33.08 Some people aren't subscribed.
02:40:33.08 --> 02:40:35.88 In the event, uh, yeah, you know,
02:40:35.88 --> 02:40:36.72 it's it.
02:40:36.72 --> 02:40:39.64 I guess it's just our guests, my guests.
02:40:39.64 --> 02:40:42.60 There's probably
02:40:42.60 --> 02:40:46.48 high hypothesis speaking, this is my hypothesis.
02:40:46.48 --> 02:40:48.72 What I'm saying, this is probably a marginal group,
02:40:48.72 --> 02:40:50.12 who's like, eh, who's jockel?
02:40:50.12 --> 02:40:52.12 I heard him on Joe Rogan or I don't know.
02:40:52.12 --> 02:40:53.88 I seen him on whatever.
02:40:53.88 --> 02:40:55.44 I think I'm listening to the podcast.
02:40:55.44 --> 02:40:56.80 I was like, okay, cool.
02:40:56.80 --> 02:40:58.52 I'm listening to a lemony listen to another one.
02:40:58.52 --> 02:41:00.000 Okay, cool.
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.72 Maybe I'm not down.
02:41:01.72 --> 02:41:02.76 You know, he's kind of weird.
02:41:02.76 --> 02:41:05.24 Or just whatever they don't understand.
02:41:05.24 --> 02:41:07.96 Like, oh, I can subscribe to this.
02:41:07.96 --> 02:41:09.08 Like, I can just get it.
02:41:09.08 --> 02:41:10.36 It'll tell me when it's coming.
02:41:10.36 --> 02:41:10.72 Right?
02:41:10.72 --> 02:41:12.76 Because a lot of people don't listen to podcasts.
02:41:12.76 --> 02:41:13.76 Yeah.
02:41:13.76 --> 02:41:15.24 I got a question for you about that.
02:41:15.24 --> 02:41:17.44 Have you thought about,
02:41:17.44 --> 02:41:19.48 because you, this is number 90.
02:41:19.48 --> 02:41:19.68 Yes.
02:41:19.68 --> 02:41:23.12 If you thought about breaking the podcasts into categories,
02:41:23.12 --> 02:41:25.48 to speak to your audience,
02:41:25.48 --> 02:41:28.32 because you cover such a broad audience,
02:41:28.32 --> 02:41:29.68 when you say breaking them,
02:41:29.68 --> 02:41:32.12 you mean just another section like,
02:41:32.12 --> 02:41:33.24 cut them up?
02:41:33.24 --> 02:41:35.12 No, no, no, the full podcast.
02:41:35.12 --> 02:41:37.12 But like, where your cover books,
02:41:37.12 --> 02:41:38.48 where you're talking about business,
02:41:38.48 --> 02:41:40.16 where you're interviewing somebody,
02:41:40.16 --> 02:41:42.40 breaking them up that way.
02:41:42.40 --> 02:41:43.24 Yeah, they are.
02:41:43.24 --> 02:41:44.12 It's been technically,
02:41:44.12 --> 02:41:45.60 because it's not a linear.
02:41:45.60 --> 02:41:46.44 Right.
02:41:46.44 --> 02:41:47.76 You don't have to listen from one.
02:41:47.76 --> 02:41:48.60 Right.
02:41:48.60 --> 02:41:50.96 I recommend, when someone says, hey,
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:53.56 you know, I just heard your podcasts.
02:41:53.56 --> 02:41:54.72 Oh, I heard, I heard,
02:41:54.72 --> 02:41:55.72 I just listened to that podcast.
02:41:55.72 --> 02:41:56.72 You just put out.
02:41:56.72 --> 02:41:58.40 I want to listen to the rest of them.
02:41:58.40 --> 02:41:59.36 Should I go backwards?
02:41:59.36 --> 02:42:00.20 Should I go forwards?
02:42:00.20 --> 02:42:02.16 And I tell people start at one.
02:42:02.16 --> 02:42:05.64 And most of the people that I talk to that are
02:42:05.64 --> 02:42:07.24 into the podcast, they're like,
02:42:07.24 --> 02:42:08.28 that's the right advice.
02:42:08.28 --> 02:42:09.60 Tell people start at one.
02:42:09.60 --> 02:42:13.56 If I said, Jockel, I want to listen to your
02:42:13.56 --> 02:42:15.20 really business related podcasts.
02:42:15.20 --> 02:42:15.84 Right.
02:42:15.84 --> 02:42:17.24 I couldn't could I do that or no.
02:42:17.24 --> 02:42:19.16 What we are going to do,
02:42:19.16 --> 02:42:22.72 and I have this in the background going into something
02:42:22.72 --> 02:42:24.48 that I've been trying to get down for a while is,
02:42:24.48 --> 02:42:26.16 we're going to kind of archive where you're going to be
02:42:26.16 --> 02:42:28.32 able to maybe figure out, oh,
02:42:28.32 --> 02:42:30.08 I want to listen to business boom.
02:42:30.08 --> 02:42:31.64 And here's a podcast, you know,
02:42:31.64 --> 02:42:32.76 the section.
02:42:32.76 --> 02:42:35.12 Now whether or not we like chop them up
02:42:35.12 --> 02:42:37.36 and put them into one group,
02:42:37.36 --> 02:42:39.000 not yet, not yet.
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:42.92 Yeah, I mean, it's not organized.
02:42:42.92 --> 02:42:45.08 We'll say, but it's one of those things.
02:42:45.08 --> 02:42:46.48 You got to manually look, you know,
02:42:46.48 --> 02:42:47.64 because it'll say what it's about.
02:42:47.64 --> 02:42:50.52 In fact, the podcast, it's straight up by time stamp.
02:42:50.52 --> 02:42:51.80 Yeah, it's like it's about stock.
02:42:51.80 --> 02:42:52.80 It's about stock.
02:42:52.80 --> 02:42:54.04 So you can kind of do it that way,
02:42:54.04 --> 02:42:55.20 but no, not organized.
02:42:55.20 --> 02:42:57.60 Like if you're, and it makes sense, though,
02:42:57.60 --> 02:43:00.64 because if we're talking about a book and people like,
02:43:00.64 --> 02:43:02.32 what love world or to love it.
02:43:02.32 --> 02:43:03.16 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:43:03.16 --> 02:43:04.000 Boom, all right.
02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:05.000 Yeah, there's 10 podcasts and one more or two.
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:05.80 Yeah, yeah.
02:43:05.80 --> 02:43:06.88 And they can just get after it.
02:43:06.88 --> 02:43:08.36 And then maybe, you know,
02:43:08.36 --> 02:43:09.20 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:43:09.20 --> 02:43:09.20 Just like, yeah, yeah.
02:43:09.20 --> 02:43:10.04 Good idea.
02:43:10.04 --> 02:43:11.20 Pete, I like the house.
02:43:11.20 --> 02:43:12.04 Big time.
02:43:12.04 --> 02:43:13.52 But yeah, subscribe.
02:43:13.52 --> 02:43:14.36 That's a good one.

02:46:20.84 --> 02:46:21.84 Yeah.
02:46:21.84 --> 02:46:23.12 I think we should consult.
02:46:23.12 --> 02:46:25.28 No, he, I'm going to tell you.
02:46:25.28 --> 02:46:27.28 I already know what he's going to say.
02:46:27.28 --> 02:46:28.28 He's from Hawaii.
02:46:28.28 --> 02:46:29.68 What do you want to lie away hoodie?
02:46:29.68 --> 02:46:31.56 No, he, so he made hoodies.
02:46:31.56 --> 02:46:32.56 And I'm from New England.
02:46:32.56 --> 02:46:36.12 And so I was like, oh, you make a hoodie, you can wear it in like a full-fledged, artich store.
02:46:36.12 --> 02:46:38.60 I mean, you'd better have a heavyweight gun hoodie.

02:46:43.80 --> 02:46:44.80 They're good for Hawaii.
02:46:44.80 --> 02:46:45.80 If you even have hoodies in Hawaii.
02:46:45.80 --> 02:46:47.56 They're like a fall hoodie, I guess.
02:46:47.56 --> 02:46:49.28 And even that's like my guess.
02:46:49.28 --> 02:46:50.28 I don't know.

02:49:03.28 --> 02:49:06.28 And what it shouldn't be doing and what it should be doing.
02:49:06.28 --> 02:49:07.28 And you'd be like, oh, okay.

02:50:16.28 --> 02:50:18.28 And then you know accountability.
02:50:18.28 --> 02:50:19.28 Yeah.
02:50:19.28 --> 02:50:20.28 Nobody's watching.
02:50:20.28 --> 02:50:21.28 Yeah.
02:50:21.28 --> 02:50:22.28 You can do it.
02:50:22.28 --> 02:50:22.28 Yeah.
02:50:22.28 --> 02:50:24.28 When I feel like a little bit marching some coffee, whatever.
02:50:24.28 --> 02:50:26.28 It's right outside, you know, kind of.
02:50:26.28 --> 02:50:27.28 I totally get it.
02:50:27.28 --> 02:50:28.28 Yeah.
02:50:28.28 --> 02:50:30.28 And that night turns into hell, do it tomorrow.
02:50:30.28 --> 02:50:33.28 So you basically turn a workout day into a rest day.
02:50:33.28 --> 02:50:36.28 And this helps you turn on your motivation again.
02:50:36.28 --> 02:50:37.28 Yeah.
02:50:37.28 --> 02:50:38.28 And it's again.
02:50:38.28 --> 02:50:40.28 It's not like a motivational thing.
02:50:40.28 --> 02:50:41.28 It's like, okay.
02:50:41.28 --> 02:50:43.28 This is, it's joccal saying it.
02:50:43.28 --> 02:50:44.28 So okay.
02:50:44.28 --> 02:50:45.28 There's that.
02:50:45.28 --> 02:50:46.28 But it's like, it's saying, okay.
02:50:46.28 --> 02:50:47.28 This is what's going on.
02:50:47.28 --> 02:50:48.28 What's your thinking right now?
02:50:48.28 --> 02:50:50.28 This is what you shouldn't be thinking right now.
02:50:50.28 --> 02:50:51.28 This is what you should be thinking right now.
02:50:51.28 --> 02:50:52.28 Okay.
02:50:52.28 --> 02:50:53.28 There you go.
02:50:53.28 --> 02:50:54.28 Go.
02:50:54.28 --> 02:50:57.28 It's in your like, the thing that I find about him is because it is me talking.
02:50:57.28 --> 02:50:58.28 Yeah.
02:50:58.28 --> 02:50:59.28 I find it.
02:50:59.28 --> 02:51:03.28 They're, they're very, um, very tight arguments.
02:51:03.28 --> 02:51:04.28 Yeah.
02:51:04.28 --> 02:51:05.28 Yeah.
02:51:05.28 --> 02:51:06.28 You know get done listening and you go.
02:51:06.28 --> 02:51:07.28 You know what?
02:51:07.28 --> 02:51:09.28 I still find a little hole in his argument.
02:51:09.28 --> 02:51:11.28 You know, I think this one sugar code is one will be buys it.
02:51:11.28 --> 02:51:12.28 Not going to be happy.
02:51:12.28 --> 02:51:13.28 No.
02:51:13.28 --> 02:51:14.28 You're like, you know what?
02:51:14.28 --> 02:51:15.28 This is a big deal.
02:51:15.28 --> 02:51:16.28 Yeah.
02:51:16.28 --> 02:51:18.28 You know, you might be the ultimate test case.
02:51:18.28 --> 02:51:19.28 Yeah.
02:51:19.28 --> 02:51:20.28 I will be the ultimate.
02:51:20.28 --> 02:51:21.28 I don't care.
02:51:21.28 --> 02:51:23.28 I don't care who's around me.
02:51:23.28 --> 02:51:25.28 Ben, if like, I get that craving for sugar.
02:51:25.28 --> 02:51:27.28 We would travel in the other day.
02:51:27.28 --> 02:51:28.28 What I get?
02:51:28.28 --> 02:51:29.28 Sweet tea.
02:51:29.28 --> 02:51:30.28 Oh, dang.
02:51:30.28 --> 02:51:32.28 Why sugar sugar.
02:51:32.28 --> 02:51:33.28 Sugar.
02:51:33.28 --> 02:51:34.28 But keep it in mind.
02:51:34.28 --> 02:51:37.28 I'm going to ruin you.
02:51:37.28 --> 02:51:38.28 No, your mom is.
02:51:38.28 --> 02:51:39.28 I know.
02:51:39.28 --> 02:51:40.28 I can't.
02:51:40.28 --> 02:51:41.28 Yeah.
02:51:41.28 --> 02:51:43.28 She's like, you know, you're like, hey, you want to try these things.
02:51:43.28 --> 02:51:46.28 I know what it is.
02:51:46.28 --> 02:51:48.28 And you said, man, you've got to try this buckle on my mom's.
02:51:48.28 --> 02:51:49.28 I don't know.
02:51:49.28 --> 02:51:50.28 I know it's sweet, right?
02:51:50.28 --> 02:51:51.28 And you go like, yeah, it is.
02:51:51.28 --> 02:51:52.28 I go like this.
02:51:52.28 --> 02:51:54.28 You've had Spartan buckle.
02:51:54.28 --> 02:51:56.28 Yeah, I was like, you know, you know, no, we deal.
02:51:56.28 --> 02:52:00.28 And, you know, we've been lately been saying, like, you know, the discipline won't allow it.
02:52:00.28 --> 02:52:01.28 That's true.
02:52:01.28 --> 02:52:01.28 Yeah.
02:52:01.28 --> 02:52:02.28 That's the new between the people.
02:52:02.28 --> 02:52:06.28 You know, when we, you know, maybe see each other, maybe taking a prayer that we shouldn't be taking.
02:52:06.28 --> 02:52:09.28 And we're going off the path and on to the path of weakness.
02:52:09.28 --> 02:52:12.28 You know, I might be like, hey, I go, you know, that's cool and everything.
02:52:12.28 --> 02:52:14.28 The discipline won't allow that.
02:52:14.28 --> 02:52:15.28 Oh, man.
02:52:15.28 --> 02:52:16.28 So that's awesome.
02:52:16.28 --> 02:52:23.28 You know, yesterday, you know, you're dangling this custom homemade buckle of a and my mom's there.
02:52:23.28 --> 02:52:24.28 And your mom's there.
02:52:24.28 --> 02:52:27.28 Actually, like, and I know, I can see her.
02:52:27.28 --> 02:52:32.28 She looks like she arrived from Greece three days ago to make the buckle of a.
02:52:32.28 --> 02:52:36.28 You know, like, okay, I'll have one, right?
02:52:36.28 --> 02:52:38.28 So I had one yesterday.
02:52:38.28 --> 02:52:40.28 And then the discipline went an allowing more.
02:52:40.28 --> 02:52:42.28 Today, I had nine of them.
02:52:42.28 --> 02:52:46.28 I had three of them.
02:52:46.28 --> 02:52:47.28 I had three of them.
02:52:47.28 --> 02:52:49.28 Sugar coated lies, uh, buckle of a.
02:52:49.28 --> 02:52:50.28 Yeah.
02:52:50.28 --> 02:52:52.28 My mom was going to get called to make buckle of a.
02:52:52.28 --> 02:52:53.28 Yeah.
02:52:53.28 --> 02:52:55.28 We're just going to put the original buckle of a person.
02:52:55.28 --> 02:52:57.28 We got the maple syrup.
02:52:57.28 --> 02:52:58.28 Yeah.
02:52:58.28 --> 02:53:03.28 But yeah, but keep in mind, though, with these tracks, you got to be on that path though.
02:53:03.28 --> 02:53:05.28 It's not like you're like, hey, I eat too much.
02:53:05.28 --> 02:53:06.28 Let me listen to this track.
02:53:06.28 --> 02:53:07.28 It's not that.
02:53:07.28 --> 02:53:09.28 It's like, okay, my plan is to straight up clean up my whole shit.
02:53:09.28 --> 02:53:12.28 Like, my plan is to say, you've already found a bit of motivation.
02:53:12.28 --> 02:53:13.28 Yes, you're motivated.
02:53:13.28 --> 02:53:14.28 You're on the path.
02:53:14.28 --> 02:53:18.28 But it's on the weakness moments, the moment we.
02:53:18.28 --> 02:53:20.28 We can see like, okay, I'm going to rest today.
02:53:20.28 --> 02:53:21.28 I'm going to, you know, whatever.
02:53:21.28 --> 02:53:22.28 Is that kind of, yeah?
02:53:22.28 --> 02:53:23.28 I do that.
02:53:23.28 --> 02:53:24.28 I do that.
02:53:24.28 --> 02:53:25.28 I do.
02:53:25.28 --> 02:53:26.28 We all do.
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:26.28 We all do.
02:53:26.28 --> 02:53:29.28 That's, that's probably why a lot of people get that album.
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:30.28 Yeah.
02:53:30.28 --> 02:53:31.28 With tracks.
02:53:31.28 --> 02:53:32.28 You know what I do?
02:53:32.28 --> 02:53:34.28 I'm like, you're actually not used to do.
02:53:34.28 --> 02:53:36.28 No, no, what I would do is this.
02:53:36.28 --> 02:53:38.28 I'd be like, especially when I was training for competition.
02:53:38.28 --> 02:53:41.28 I'm going to eat this will be pie.
02:53:41.28 --> 02:53:44.28 I would eat it and I would run two miles.
02:53:44.28 --> 02:53:45.28 Yeah.
02:53:45.28 --> 02:53:46.28 I was just, you've earned it.
02:53:46.28 --> 02:53:47.28 Freaking right.
02:53:47.28 --> 02:53:48.28 Yeah.
02:53:48.28 --> 02:53:49.28 You're in it.
02:53:49.28 --> 02:53:50.28 Freaking right.
02:53:50.28 --> 02:53:51.28 I do that, too.
02:53:51.28 --> 02:53:52.28 Like, like, it.
02:53:52.28 --> 02:53:55.28 And it's like, I try and preempt weakness with hardcore exercise.
02:53:55.28 --> 02:53:56.28 Yeah, you pay attention.
02:53:56.28 --> 02:53:58.28 Which by the way, often mitigates.
02:53:58.28 --> 02:54:01.28 Yeah, it takes like, like, oh, I want to have a mint chocolate chip milkshake.
02:54:01.28 --> 02:54:02.28 Cool.
02:54:02.28 --> 02:54:06.28 I can have a mint chocolate chip milkshake as soon as I do 30 clean and jerks.
02:54:06.28 --> 02:54:07.28 Okay.
02:54:07.28 --> 02:54:08.28 And that I can do that.
02:54:08.28 --> 02:54:10.28 And that's cool.
02:54:10.28 --> 02:54:14.28 But then, but the time you get done, you're like, you know what I want that thing.
02:54:14.28 --> 02:54:18.28 I infused my brain with discipline from the bar.
02:54:18.28 --> 02:54:21.28 It went from the bar into my hands and into my brain.
02:54:21.28 --> 02:54:22.28 Yeah.
02:54:22.28 --> 02:54:23.28 That's how I don't worry.
02:54:23.28 --> 02:54:24.28 Yeah.
02:54:24.28 --> 02:54:25.28 In the simplest one is buries.
02:54:25.28 --> 02:54:26.28 Yeah.
02:54:26.28 --> 02:54:27.28 Burpees.
02:54:27.28 --> 02:54:28.28 Like, okay.
02:54:28.28 --> 02:54:29.28 You know what?
02:54:29.28 --> 02:54:30.28 I can have this if I do a hundred burpees.
02:54:30.28 --> 02:54:33.28 That takes less than 10 minutes.
02:54:33.28 --> 02:54:36.28 We had this thing the other day and I talked about it.
02:54:36.28 --> 02:54:37.28 I was like, oh, I know it's all the way up there.
02:54:37.28 --> 02:54:40.28 And I said, I've got one of lazy loser.
02:54:40.28 --> 02:54:42.28 You don't even deserve ice cream.
02:54:42.28 --> 02:54:43.28 I didn't have it.
02:54:43.28 --> 02:54:44.28 Yeah.
02:54:44.28 --> 02:54:45.28 Because I said, you're a pathetic.
02:54:45.28 --> 02:54:47.28 If you're actually questioning whether it's worth it.
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:49.28 God, I'm not going to be like, you don't need this at all.
02:54:49.28 --> 02:54:50.28 And anyway, shape or form.
02:54:50.28 --> 02:54:53.28 If you were thinking it wasn't worth 27 steps to get to the RV, grab the mint
02:54:53.28 --> 02:54:54.28 chocolate chip.
02:54:54.28 --> 02:54:55.28 Briler's ice cream.
02:54:55.28 --> 02:54:56.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:54:56.28 --> 02:54:57.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:54:57.28 --> 02:54:58.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:54:58.28 --> 02:54:59.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:54:59.28 --> 02:55:00.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:55:00.28 --> 02:55:01.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:55:01.28 --> 02:55:02.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:55:02.28 --> 02:55:03.28 I think it's a good idea.
02:55:03.28 --> 02:55:06.28 But there are secret objects.
02:55:06.28 --> 02:55:07.28 There aren't objects hidden in steps to get to the RV.
02:55:07.28 --> 02:55:09.28 Grab the mint chocolate chip.
02:55:09.28 --> 02:55:12.28 Briler's ice cream.
02:55:12.28 --> 02:55:12.28 Bring it back down.
02:55:12.28 --> 02:55:13.28 Scoop it into it.
02:55:13.28 --> 02:55:15.28 Letting melt a little bit.
02:55:15.28 --> 02:55:17.28 Just sit there and get after it.
02:55:17.28 --> 02:55:19.28 Not best.
02:55:19.28 --> 02:55:20.28 That's so good.
02:55:20.28 --> 02:55:22.28 You'd like a little melt to the ice cream.
02:55:22.28 --> 02:55:25.28 Just a little melt.
02:55:25.28 --> 02:55:26.28 You like it, insolence.
02:55:26.28 --> 02:55:27.28 It's here.
02:55:27.28 --> 02:55:28.28 It kind of.
02:55:28.28 --> 02:55:31.28 It's, you basically take ice cream.
02:55:31.28 --> 02:55:36.56 And you put milking it and you start around. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I do
02:55:36.56 --> 02:55:37.92 Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
02:55:38.56 --> 02:55:44.12 Let's let's all be tattooing now and consider what we're talking about right now the pleasures of gains bull
02:55:44.68 --> 02:55:47.28 The problem is chocolate chip ice cream
02:55:47.28 --> 02:55:51.08 I would walk barefoot and two feet of snow to that friggin RV
02:55:52.08 --> 02:55:54.20 Yeah, that's like this guy no he was that
02:55:54.20 --> 02:56:00.48 I know my compliment that are does that negative repository? No yours is worse. It's weird because you have a better result
02:56:00.48 --> 02:56:04.86 But your disc or your worn path is worth because he was like hey, I'm gonna be weak
02:56:04.86 --> 02:56:09.12 I have this one that you know weak to be weak. Yeah, that was him that day
02:56:09.36 --> 02:56:16.10 Yeah, but you could that's rationalize because the end you know the means and the end yeah situation thing is I actually embarrassed myself
02:56:16.10 --> 02:56:23.64 Yeah, yeah, that's what it was I just he made myself and I said I can't believe I'm even questioning the fact if I would take 27 steps to my
02:56:23.64 --> 02:56:29.72 Orbent the ice cream the fact that I'm even thinking that way. I don't you don't I should I should he's myself
02:56:30.12 --> 02:56:36.36 Right, this is ridiculous and pathetic and just stop and so yeah, I didn't get the ice cream that night
02:56:36.36 --> 02:56:42.88 But the mint chocolate chip ice cream first year is is a real thing and it's even
02:56:43.40 --> 02:56:49.80 It's my favorite flavor. Yeah, yeah, I don't even know the introduction is my flavors although when I wasn't Montana
02:56:49.80 --> 02:56:55.52 Ustrax lose tracks in most tracks. Yes, lose tracks. That's the other that's the other. Okay
02:56:55.52 --> 02:57:01.04 I'm not gonna you know I understand and I saw it and I dig it, but it's just it's very surprising
02:57:01.04 --> 02:57:10.64 You talk you can you can close the moves track with a scoop of mint chocolate chip. I've never done that that sounds deranged
02:57:10.64 --> 02:57:12.64 It's like it would
02:57:12.64 --> 02:57:14.64 She's she's in wine
02:57:15.92 --> 02:57:17.28 She's
02:57:17.28 --> 02:57:21.92 Just close it's just a fish in touch is that what she do is that what she did now?
02:57:21.92 --> 02:57:25.88 I want to my buddies in the in the trees
