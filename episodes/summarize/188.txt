This long game this long plan is recognizing what we're doing now this it isn't going to work forever we're going to have to change we have to see where we're where we're going and that is going to change all the time and that requires is a leader to be looking up and out all the time you asked that question the muster when should we be thinking strategically. And you know, people like conflict avoidance, like the idea of conflict avoidance is what you're really trying to do is, are you actually going to be able to convince the person of what's the best thing in their world and the best outcome that you're trying to get to? Like, you know, and I've no, I've told you and the team is like, hey, you guys want to know why I don't sleep because I'm paranoid of what's going to happen. Because what you don't want to have is, now the conversation with Jaco, I don't know what's going to happen, but eventually he's going to win and I'm going to be proved that he's smart of me and sooner or later. You're going to sit there and you're going to be in the combined arms dilemma because you're going to come out looking, looking bad because you're now back peddling trying to explain things that shouldn't need to be explained in the first place. In some of the things in the combined arms side I know this as an aviator look the enemy doesn't have an unlimited number of directions to attack us from all the time they're actually places where they can attack areas we control areas we have dominance over and so if you think about. If you're going to change GJ2, you're going to want to get a G. If you're going to want to do G and no GJ2, origin main.com, this is RJ2 company. I want the worst possible environment because I know more than likely that other guy, that other company, they're going to win it in that and we're going to go on the attack. It's like, yeah, that seems like good things like what I want, but that's not what you want. And when the Marine Corps talks about doing this they don't know if it's going to be the aircraft or the indirect fire or the machine because they don't know which one it's going to be. All the time all the time and that it's that vision of looking of if you don't have an idea of where you're going to be down the road you're never going to get to where you need to be and they're going to try maneuver but guess what we're going to immediately fire back at you we're going to fire back at you hard The first time, well, it was, I don't know if it's the first time, but when they started using boats where we're all of a sudden in areas, you know, Charlie, the two and showing up in areas where the enemy had no freaking idea that Americans would be in these spots and be able to engage them. And if you're going to make that investment in that time and that commitment to doing that, spend as much time as you possibly can, taking advantage of whatever it is you've created by going through that work and doing that. I'm thinking this is going to be awesome because I'm not going to overreact to this arm bar I'm going to and guess what happened. And what I hear from leaders of, you know, you know, I got to have a direct conversation with this person and tell him what's going on. That vision isn't isn't always just literal vision is it's actually where where is this organization going to go because when you're inside in your tactical guy like most of your employees are doing tactical things. We don't have the market, but you know what you have, you've got 25 people you know quickly you can communicate, you know, fast you can get back It allows you to do this thing that actually, if you kind of think about it in some terms, decentralized command, you could actually make an argument that it's the most important thing in combat in this particular case because it's so required because you as a leader can't be in 15 different places. Lastly, outweigh is whatever discomfort you might be feeling when they hate we're going to suck it up and operate in bad weather or we're going to do things our competition doesn't want to do because it's sort of sucks. Yeah, like, you know, how many times the late babbin came up to me and said hey man, I could really use it, really either or jpe, he didn't even know. It's actually being able to just see what the terrain looks like and recognizing that is the best place to be to recognize where the commanding event is going to occur to bring my forces to bear. The the saw guys they all dump their mags and then their silence and then it's who can get reloaded to quickest but what they did in that moment is take away the advantage of the enemy because the enemy is attacking them and their immediate reaction is oh you're going to shoot it us. That book, the stories in all three of those books, just like with the podcast, my kids are learning things that I didn't think they were able to learn at their age and they are and their lessons that are applying to their, my daughter's going in fifth grade. So when you want to create that sense of urgency, when you want to get people to understand the importance of time, and that we never waste time and that we feel guilty for that word if we're idle. You know what I think of one of the best examples that I can think of when I think of combined arms effectiveness being used effectively was when we were in the body and the enemy would utilize combined arms attacks. I'm like, that's exactly right because if they did come down to your world, they don't have every single minute of every single day of all the context you have for the problem you're dealing with, and no matter what they do, it's going to be wrong because they don't understand it as well as you do. It allows you to think about what it means to be a leader and how to actually problem solve in real time and the recognition that you got to think about that's up every single day. The action drills and the seal team to we were learning from the Vietnam guys when they got contacted in the jungle the very first thing they did was hit the ground and everyone unloads a magazine into their field of fire period and the story that's what's going to happen. If there was a question between, hey, you know what, we can save, we can make this a little easier on the volunteers or we are on the employees or we can adjust this a little bit and save a little bit of money here or hey, it doesn't matter if the people that are attending might not be able to see the whole. We've got the triangle, arm lock, sweep, combination, happening no matter which way they're caught in that dilemma, which way are they going to get tapped out or swept or end up in a worse position. So actually, when you have a mission of 24 airplanes, you've got guys that are dedicated as fighters to shoot down enemy aircraft and you know what? If you want to see what Dave Burke looks like, you can see, if you want to see what anything, the guests, if you want to see what I look like, then you can go to there. And guys, you know, so one guy's like, hey man, we just got here, I'm tired, I'm trying to sort out my ammunition. I'm trying to get you to do what I want you to do, because it's going to benefit you, and it's going to benefit the team. When we get into leadership and we get into relationships, if I've got someone that's got a strong, passionate idea about something, I am not going to attack that idea with my passion and my strong feeling. You're going to lose because you know what your enemy is doing right now. And you would think that in striving for it, it would come to be clear how you actually do it and how you actually give people decentralized commanders by actually letting go. But most of the time, there's a way to maneuver that's going to make that whole situation infinitely better than your direct assault on their brain. I'm going to manipulate Dave into wanting to do good work by giving him this false sense that I'm going to give them some control over his own fate.
