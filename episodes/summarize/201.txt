I let those emotions all go so then when it did happen it was like I guess when you do this idea of like preparing right where your it's almost like I knew this was coming like you hear people like I knew it I knew it right like I had no idea and so to have something shock your system that much I think it kind of rewires you where you're kind of waiting for that next shock to the system and you know you lead on throughout the book and and I've had other things that have that have happened since where I know like there no one is void of having something happen you know whether it's random in nature I've had a lot of random crappy things happened to me you know over the last several years I guess it's similar again this is something I just talked about with Jim Sersley who was on the last podcast was in Vietnam and the range of level of fear that guys have going into combat there's some people that are scared they're like they think they're gonna die right and I'm I'm definitely a a jumpier person you know like I hear something like what happened you know we're before I was not like that I was kind of like um you heard something you know you talk a little bit about that more here you say the fear and paranoia that follow in the wake of grief can create a tremendous roadblock it stunts our personal growth and darkens our overall sense of well-being some people respond to unexpected and trying situations with passive acquiescence and others with fire and fury I responded by heightening my vigilance after Travis's death I found myself compelled to be wary I was always on the lookout for the next great tragedy to befall me this hurled me down some very dark and troublesome paths from panic attacks to self-destructive behaviors but also led me to some amazing gifts like recovering my sense of humor and living with intention what self-destructive behaviors did you pick up I mean I think you know self-destructive in a way that you know I stopped kind of taking care of myself you know and they're like what could you have you know the image in your head of someone with dying of stage four cancer like she just she didn't look like that and what were you thinking this whole time I was very pragmatic I was like my mom's dying in eight months I did not um my dad on the other side was like I'm not listening to that like there's there's miracles happen every day we just got to you know stay the course things will see if there's trials you know they're trying all sorts of different holistic diets and and I was very much um supportive of that let's try everything and anything and I would be like okay Janet like like I roll like why don't we just try to get like a thousand people at the run next year you know that would be like a cool goal and there was all these people around much different scene than the chaos around Travis's death I'm sitting there and I'm like I need you to do this this is my ulogy I want you to go home go back and make these revisions on the computer print it back like I was running the show I'm like I'm in charge I'm taking over I'm going to make sure all this is getting done and we do the most beautiful tribute to this woman and after that I kept going just with that same like do do do like grind every single day whatever it may be and then it was that Christmas party where and my husband again you know he's he he has some insight yeah can you give me an example of just one so you know there's like the breathing techniques of course like for me a lot of it was like the breathing because I would get to like these peaked peaked feelings of anxiety where you know it was like fighter flight I've experienced like when something really bad happens, like when I've lost friends and I wake up in the morning and for like three, literally three seconds, you know, the alarm clock goes off and I, you know, shut off the alarm clock and I, and everything's like totally normal for like for three seconds. and and it and it doesn't come as as often but like you said you know 50 60 years out a service member talking about his friends like that's never going to go away and nor what I wanted to exactly exactly you continue on here like anyone who is received a jarring knock at the door literal or figurative and that's what's important and you again since I'm jumping around this book you know there's the metaphorical knock at the door that a service member's family can receive but the knock in the door can be anything sure anything that is unexpected in your life and everyone's going to get him in your life you're going to get a knock at the door that you want to do what your mom did which slammed the door and don't let it come in but it's coming when I played the video that part for some reason when you you're like two mice on and it's you know and especially if you have kids you're like oh man you know you're sending your kid off into the crazy world you know kind of on his own it's like man it kind of like it's not more runny right which I probably had some conversations with like that about with my kids you know where you know my daughters they'll say like I just don't feel like doing anything right now it was like well that means you need to do something but it was that each and every day and I got to the point where I'm like I'm having mental health issues right now like this is not just a isolated event like something's something's happening here and to have me go sit on a couch with a therapist was like for me that was that was a big deal and a big deal because you thought you're too you're too strong for this you know it And I think that's why my dad's just like, I'm going to stand out in this driveway, you know, with Colonel Gardner, because he's just like, and then the rest is like, all these women and people are coming up like, what do you need? I don't subscribe to anybody that thinks that your physical health is not 100% tied to your mental health like you know I used to think my dad was incredibly insensitive when I would try to talk to him about like you know ailments of the mind and he would tie it all back to like you know well if you ran or well they broke down some of your outtakes and just did like it's like a minute long like wait is it bloopers it's not bloopers it's like thoughts from jaca like no it's cool and I hit it for a while I didn't tell my husband and tell my friend like I told no one because I'm just like so you know I was like you don't want your husband to say shut up I'm tired exactly what I was like has time so I didn't he's like I thought it was really like heavily focused on the military he's like these are like my key grips and they were like Yeah, I mean, my, I remember in high school, my girlfriends and I, we follow him around the Philadelphia area to his wrestling matches and we were like his main cheering squad in the front row and I'm like, that's my brother, the all-american wrestler, you know, I was so proud of him and it was, it was really cool to grow up with someone that even he was younger than me but that I could look up to so much, you know, and I think at the end of the day he helped me from not going too far off the rails, you know? I failed a plenty of things rather it was because I didn't care enough about anything to give it much effort I was sometimes apathetic Travis was ambitious Travis was the ambitious goal oriented one I was just coasting through life after he died and then my mom died I had a major wake-up call now I feel I feel compelled to take advantage of the time I have left on this earth to lead a life they both can be proud of and I think that's a good place to stop on my readings from this book to lead a life that they can be proud of because that message right there is just a powerful message and it's a one that I know that I think about every single day every single day I think about that and mind you we've only covered like a third of this book right here right there are stories and lessons from Heather and from Amy and like I said hopefully I can have them on but you know the doctors tell us like you've got eight months to live with treatment if you decide to go to the treatment route it's just gonna help prolong you we're gonna give you about eight months my mom never really took that and was like she didn't do one of these I've got eight months to live this is what I'm gonna do she was just like and he's he's he's he's people like you gonna run the marathon he's like I'll never run a marathon again he's like I run to live my life like it's all it's all for maintenance for him I'm dying here on Christmas night and and it was my husband being like in you know he's like shut up you're not dying I'm tired and it was hearing those words like I'm tired I'm like and I know what I know the reasoning behind it if I can look back and like psychoanalyze myself when Travis was in Iraq I was not worried about him and when he was there the first time when he was there the second time even though I knew the second deployment was different I was aware of that because my husband told me he's like hey this is gonna be different you know I've had conversations with your brother like legitimate we like like you know like to show the power of internet bullying or whatever and I'm like no way you know it's all about the memories we have to have it you know and the idea that the year after my mom passes away we wouldn't have this like that's just unheard of like there's no way and you know it's so cool about that what you just said you even realize how right you are because like I had my iPod in Iraq my last deployment which was 2006 and those songs like what however many songs were on my iPad at the time like whatever 215 songs or whatever it was whenever I hear those songs right now I'm right back oh when I thought I was the when I thought Travis being killed was the woman being hit with the icicle fallin off the garage like this is like let me tell you about the craziest story I've ever heard you know like how how could my mom and my brother both not be here and through that five years I was led by my parents largely in terms of things I was doing to honor my brother but I would imagine that it would just be this very strong person a person you know some people they would maybe go live waste I remember when I was young when I'd be mad at something and keeping mine on coi mad at something so whatever I mean we are very very mild madness sessions I would want to go workout like going to workout and getting under the bench like that would help that would be very therapeutic right Annie's to run on child milk too back not you know before not anymore Yeah, you know, I've, I, you know, you go through that initial phase of shock, but I remember thinking like, why couldn't he just been like, why couldn't we be flying a Germany right now, you know? and I was like oh seal training I'll make it through whatever you know and here's a total stud that was he was like I didn't know if I could make it I was like I'm you didn't have it he didn't have enough fearless ignorance you see Travis placed a call from my rack to my dad to say run the marathon he wasn't called me to say run the marathon you that wasn't even a thought in his head because he knew that there was no way I would even consider running a marathon and I've just kind of approached things as like I'm just going to do it you know what's the worst that can happen and and you do you have this like what's the my brother is dead what's the worst that can happen you know I don't make it I was smoking again I crying in the shower and regularly feeling seized by anxiety that I simply couldn't shake off if this is what life is like going to be if this is what life is going to be like from now on I thought to myself one day I'm done I can't live like this then then you talk about communicating with some of your friends commiserating with Amy this is Brendan's wife was deeply helpful in putting me back on the path to recovery two years earlier she had lost her husband Brendan if there's anyone with whom I felt I could be completely vulnerable it was her one day I called her overwhelmed and furious my therapist diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder today I shouted into the receiver can you believe that shit I don't have PTSD you know what I mean you make a funny comment right like the person that got a picture of me and it says uh feeling cute might like like hey man that's just funny I was gonna make a video of like myself where you and be like hey like Dakota I see Dakota Myers helicopter it's like and I'm on like a pro the program where it's like lifting like hard in this face I'm a little bit more old school now like I'm not as young as you see me not a start technique and so like if I was gonna keep that radio I'd be like no matter what was going on it you know whether I'm just exerting physical energy or there's chaos going on it always be like I also want to do the I also want to read YouTube comments allowed yeah we should do like what there's a show like I don't know I forget there's a bunch of shows like that I thought the lifting was more therapeutic and then jujitsu is like magnitudes top of the therapeutic pyramid in terms of physical activity by far too like by far like more than one level like too low and you know that panic attack that night it was I I've had anxiety a little bit you know growing up in my teens like you know what what what I should say what I thought was anxiety this was literally I thought I was dying I was like and so it was like when I get to that point what what do I do because I don't know if you've ever had an actual panic attack I had not you feel like you're dying it is the craziest feeling in the world the thing that makes me really which must make this harder right is if you like let's say you're starting to have a panic attack I'm in it and a half it's like you got to keep their attention on the internet and stuff that was kind of the thing right apparently the new emergent status is the people we like the longer forms stuff we're beginning to let you're just catching up with that over there yes isn't this like we've been making three hour podcast for years but remember we have a lot of podcasts and I'm like I like that like I like that I can sit here and talk to you so we we just want to create a community that wants to pass that down and we've got eight offices across the country we've got a membership base of about 120,000 people and you know we we we call ourselves the Spartans like and we're largely made up of civilians believe it or not but these are people that feel that sense of pride for men and women like you you know well thank you for the three of you for writing this book for sharing the challenges that you've gone through the triumphs the it's this I know like I said that the stories in this book are gonna help they're gonna help people that are struggling when they're knocking at the door whenever that knock at the door is when it comes their way this book will well we'll help them get through it and even more important than that thank you for the service and sacrifice of your family that you guys have made it's obviously something that I will never forget and nor will are great nation ever forget that and thanks for what you're doing with the Travis Manion foundation to keep his legacy and his spirit and his character alive in order to make the world a better place what you are doing thank you well thanks for continuing to have the platform to share these stories you know it's important so I mean the the lessons that you're putting now this is all in this book are awesome tell us a little bit before we before we stop tell us a little bit about the Travis minion foundation first of all like what what's the mission what's the goal I mean really at the Travis minion foundation we are we're creating a community and we want to make sure that we are giving returning veterans and families of the fallen the opportunity to continue to serve and more importantly to be able to empower them post military life I think you know when you look at today 55% of men and women who are taking off the uniform when you ask them what their greatest challenges it's that that loss of purpose you know they don't have that sense of purpose and their life anymore
