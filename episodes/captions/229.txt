[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 229 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,
[00:00:06] echo. Good evening. Leadership means firmness, not harshness or bullying. Understanding,
[00:00:16] not weakness. Justice, not irresponsible freedom. Humanness, not intolerance. Generosity,
[00:00:28] not selfishness, pride, not ego-tism. So, little quote for you, kick things off. This is
[00:00:40] coming. I ran across at the other day and as I ran across it, I saw some of a little bit of the
[00:00:47] dichotomy, a leadership in there and it just caught my attention and it's a quote from General Omar Bradley,
[00:00:54] a general with a good amount of name recognition. But a general who kind of flew under the radar
[00:01:05] sometimes because he was competing with some some big names. You know, he's competing with
[00:01:12] General Pat and he's competing with General Eisenhower, he's competing with General Mungumri. So,
[00:01:17] he kind of flew under the radar sometimes. You know, he does have the Bradley fighting vehicle
[00:01:23] named after him, which is a awesome machine. But he absolutely was a well regarded general in his own
[00:01:31] right born in 1893 in Randolph County, Missouri, worked as a boiler maker, figured out he could get
[00:01:41] a free education by going to West Point. So, he went to West Point, graduated in 1915,
[00:01:46] same year as Eisenhower, by the way. He was a really good athlete, baseball star, could have played
[00:01:53] pro ball, but chose to be in the army, chose to go and do his commitment to the army. So,
[00:02:01] 1915, you're probably thinking World War I, WWE, I. Well, he actually didn't go to World War I.
[00:02:10] He didn't go and fight World War I. There were mining disputes in the unions in the minds
[00:02:18] up in Montana, and they had to activate some army units to send him up there to guard the mines.
[00:02:25] And that's what he did. He did that for a little while. And then he did go to unit that was getting
[00:02:29] ready to deploy to World War I. The Spanish flu came, which everyone seems to know about the Spanish
[00:02:36] flu now. And they would then know as the armistice, and he didn't deploy. So, he didn't get any combat
[00:02:42] action in World War I. Thought that that might hurt his career, but he stayed in anyways,
[00:02:49] ended up teaching tactics at the infantry school, fast forward through the the peace years,
[00:02:55] made general in 1942, assigned the 82nd division, then the 28th National Guard Division,
[00:03:02] eventually worked under General Patton as the deputy in charge of second corps, and then took
[00:03:08] it over himself, led the campaigns in Tunisia, and Sicily, Ike Eisenhower selected Bradley to
[00:03:16] command the first army during Operation Overlord D. Day. Command, he commanded the most troops of any
[00:03:24] general US general in history. When he took command of the 12th Army group, 1.3 million troops.
[00:03:32] Little decentralized command, better coming to play right there, continue with all those troops
[00:03:37] to push through Europe until the fall of Germany. We covered Ernie Pile on this podcast,
[00:03:43] podcast number 39, his book Brave Men, it was the heaviest one of my favorite lines.
[00:03:52] Ernie Pile nicknamed him the GI general, because he was kind of a layback down to earth guy,
[00:03:58] didn't make a spectacle of himself. After the war, he ran the VA for a while, the veterans administration,
[00:04:05] first-ever chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Korean War. Retired in 1953,
[00:04:13] after 38 years of service. I found that the internet is amazing. I found an evaluation.
[00:04:23] You know, we talk about the evaluations, the evaluation, the Marine Corps evaluation,
[00:04:28] the Navy evaluation. I found an evaluation of Bradley written by General Patton.
[00:04:36] Pretty cool, because it shows what type of a person Patton was just in the way he wrote this thing.
[00:04:43] So, it says subject efficiency report. Through commanding general, NATO USA APO 534 to
[00:04:52] an agedant general, war department, Washington, D.C. Name in grade of general officer reported on,
[00:05:00] Omar F. Bradley, Lieutenant General. Period covered, 1 July 1943 to 8 September 1943,
[00:05:06] 2 months and 8 days. duties performed. Commanding general 2 core, 1 July 1943 to 8 September
[00:05:14] 19 something unclear. Manor of performance, superior, physical activity,
[00:05:22] superior, physical endurance, superior, knowledge of his profession, superior,
[00:05:29] for what command or duty would you specifically recommend him, and army.
[00:05:38] And then what opportunities have you had for observing him during period covered, intimate daily
[00:05:45] contact? Does he render a willing and generous support to plans of superiors regardless of
[00:05:51] personal views in the matter? Yes, which is a very interesting topic to cover. You think about
[00:05:59] what they've got in there, physical duty, knowledge of his profession, what job would you recommend?
[00:06:04] And then does he give generous support to plans of superiors regardless of his personal views in the
[00:06:10] matter? So, this guy is going to back you up. The answer there is yes. And 10 of all general officers
[00:06:18] of his grade personally known to you, what number would you give him on this list? And how many
[00:06:26] comprise your list? And Patent's answer is number one, I know all of them. Further remarks deemed
[00:06:36] necessary? None. signed GS Patent Jr. Lieutenant General, U.S. Army Commanding. So, that's a pretty
[00:06:46] awesome review. The interesting thing is if you know anything about the history of Bradley and Patent,
[00:06:52] there's some interesting dynamics there. First of all, they had very different personalities.
[00:06:58] Patent was, you know, flashy and ego driven in a lot of ways and Bradley was not.
[00:07:06] And there's some quotes I pulled from Patent's journal, journals about Bradley.
[00:07:12] So, it's interesting that you can have these right in that glowing
[00:07:17] like evaluation about him to try and get him promoted. But at the same time here's some things he said about him.
[00:07:25] Bradley is too conservative. He wants to wait until we can all jump into the fight together. By which
[00:07:30] time, half our men will be, will have the flu or trench foot. I wish he had a little more daring.
[00:07:35] Another one. Bradley is a good officer, but he utterly lacks it.
[00:07:39] It too bad. The it factor echo Charles. Next one, Bradley is a man of great mediocrity.
[00:07:50] On the other hand, he has many attributes which are considered desirable in a general. He wears glasses,
[00:07:57] which I have no idea. I have no idea why that's cool. To be a general. He wears glasses. He has a strong
[00:08:02] jaw. He talks profoundly and says little. And he is a shooting companion of our present chief of staff
[00:08:11] general Marshall. Also, he is a loyal man. I consider him to be among our better generals.
[00:08:20] Another quote. We had a lot quite a long talk and I told Bradley a lot of my best ideas to tell
[00:08:25] general Marshall. I suppose I should have kept them to myself, but I am not built that way.
[00:08:30] The sooner they are put into effect, the better it will be for me. So there, here we see a little
[00:08:37] plant in the seed, you know, leading up the chain of command right there.
[00:08:43] And then he says, it was really a great plan, holy my own. And I made Bradley believe that he thought of it.
[00:08:53] That's exactly what I talk about. Look, plant the seed, let them think it's their own idea.
[00:08:57] But because it's patent because he got a little bit of that ego that kicks in.
[00:09:04] He also wrote this. I do not wish any more of my ideas to be used without credit to me,
[00:09:11] which is what happens when I give them orally to Bradley. How's that for sure, excited? That's
[00:09:17] saddery. Little bit saddery. Another one where ego gets the best of patent.
[00:09:24] He says, Courtney Hodges and Omar Bradley both received a distinct service metal for their
[00:09:29] unsuccessful defense of the bulge. I did not receive one for successfully defending it. So
[00:09:36] clearly these guys had a, you know, an interesting relationship. General Bradley also wrote a book.
[00:09:47] And it's from what I gather his A. D. Camp did most of the writing, which I'm not saying that's a horrible
[00:09:55] thing because writing is a, is a mechanical thing that you have to do. And if you can get someone to catch your
[00:10:01] ideas and do it well, then it's fine. But the book was released in 1951. It's called a soldier story.
[00:10:07] It's 600 page book. Details is experienced as the army had, obviously, especially in World War II.
[00:10:13] And I'm sure we're going to cover that book at some point we're not doing it today.
[00:10:20] But you know, when I, after I read that quote about him and you know, just talking about leadership
[00:10:26] and kind of the dichotomies that are there, I remember this short piece that I haven't. I got
[00:10:30] a bunch of these little short things and a certain file folder in my computer. And they're old too.
[00:10:36] I've been collecting them for a long time. What's the name of the file? It's a books and PDFs.
[00:10:41] I have this thing, books and PDFs that I just download. I save them in a books and PDFs. I got
[00:10:46] a lot of them. We've covered a bunch of them too on this podcast. So I remembered this one of
[00:10:54] his and it is called leadership. General of the army, Omar and Bradley, the articles first published
[00:11:04] in a winter 1972 issue of parameters, which is the magazine of the US Army War College.
[00:11:12] Editors know, General to the Army, Omar and Bradley visited Carlisle Barracks on seven to eight
[00:11:17] October 1971 to meet with members of the 12th Army Group Association. While he was at Carlisle,
[00:11:23] he addressed the Army War College faculty and students on the subject of leadership.
[00:11:26] His address contained observations that were gleaned during a long and significant career.
[00:11:31] A careful reading of his remarks, give us some insight into the qualities that made
[00:11:36] General Bradley the great soldier and human being that he is. General Bradley's thesis is that leadership
[00:11:41] is an intangible that involves a constant interplay between the leader and the lead.
[00:11:48] When this interplay is successful, we have the ingredients for great accomplishment.
[00:11:53] So, there you go. Kicking into it. All of you here this evening are leaders. I am pleased to
[00:12:01] meet you. What you do may well dignify the past explained today and secure for all of us tomorrow.
[00:12:11] Perhaps I can touch upon a few factors that will underscore the value of good leadership.
[00:12:15] Leadership is an intangible. No weapon, no impersonal piece of machinery,
[00:12:23] ever designed can take its place. It's an interesting idea that leadership is intangible.
[00:12:31] Have you ever heard that expression? That somebody asked for the definition of pornography
[00:12:38] and the Supreme Court Court just said, I can't give you a definition, but I know it when I see
[00:12:42] it. It's a weird thing, because leadership, if you're going to define it specifically,
[00:12:49] it's kind of the same answer. Look, I can't tell you exactly what it is, but I know it when I see it.
[00:12:55] And you see different people do it differently. Yeah. And you can see two different people say
[00:13:00] or do the same thing, but it'd be like, hey, this guy's leading in this guy's sort of not.
[00:13:05] You know, he's doing something else. Yeah. There's, in leadership strategy and tactics. I
[00:13:12] give someone talking about pride and the same sentence about pride, depending on who is saying it,
[00:13:20] and what context it is can be negative or positive. Yeah. For instance, that guy's full of pride,
[00:13:28] right? Yeah. Or that guy's full of pride. You know what I mean? Like that's the same sentence.
[00:13:33] But it needs to completely different things. Yeah. So continuing on,
[00:13:39] this is the age of the computer, by the way, this is 1971. And if you know how to program the
[00:13:47] machine, you can get quick and accurate answers, but how can you include leadership and morale,
[00:13:54] which is affected by leadership into your programming? Let us never forget the great importance of
[00:14:00] this element, leadership, and while we use computers for certain answers, let us not try to fight a
[00:14:07] whole war or even a single battle without giving proper consideration to the element of leadership.
[00:14:15] Leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield. You're a little calculator over there.
[00:14:21] We're going to be covering a podcast shortly about the creation of Top Gun
[00:14:29] and same thing. There's some people that would do the calculations of this, this aircraft versus
[00:14:36] that aircraft. And think, well, this aircraft, this is period aircraft, it will win. How many times
[00:14:43] is that wrong? What are they not calculated? They're not calculating the human element. How many times
[00:14:48] have you watched a UFC fight? We're on paper. Everyone thought, person A was going to win,
[00:14:55] and person B wins, because the human element, they don't calculate it. So how can we expect to
[00:15:01] calculate what's going to happen in combat without trying to figure out what implication leadership
[00:15:06] has on it? Continuing on, another element to be considered is the man to be led and with
[00:15:16] who's morale we are concerned. I'm constantly reminded of this point by a cartoon which hangs over
[00:15:22] my desk at home, which depicts an infantryman with his rifle across his knees as he sits behind
[00:15:27] a parapet. Above him is the list of the newest weapons science has devised. The newest weapons
[00:15:35] science has devised and the soldier behind the parapet is saying, but they still haven't found
[00:15:40] out the substitute for me. So there's a human being. Of course, with this particular group of
[00:15:49] service personnel, I'm considering leadership as it applies to a military unit. However,
[00:15:55] having been associated with industry for some time now, I find it difficult to completely
[00:16:00] separate the principles of military and industrial leadership. They have much in common.
[00:16:05] Yeah, and he retired in 1953 this 1971. He worked with some companies. I know he was the
[00:16:11] like the chairman of Blova. Blova, how do you say it? Blova, watch company, BUL, OVA.
[00:16:17] Yeah, Blova. Yeah, Blova, blah, blah, blah. He was using the chairman of that. So that's a big company.
[00:16:23] So he understood the same thing that we now know to be true. And that's a strong statement that I
[00:16:32] say it. Yes, I did. We know to be true. I couldn't have told you this 10 years. The day I retired
[00:16:38] from the Navy, I couldn't have told you that military and civilian leadership in the same. I couldn't
[00:16:42] have answered that question. I didn't know it. I didn't know the answer. It wasn't until I
[00:16:46] started working with civilian companies that I said, oh, these are the same. The same principles
[00:16:52] employed in both situations. And that's what Omar Bradley is saying here. He says they have
[00:16:57] much in common. They have more than much. They have a lot in common. I'd go so far as to say they have
[00:17:06] everything in common. But there's differences. But I'll tell you, the differences between
[00:17:12] leading an army of platoon, leading a Marine Corp. Those there's little differences there.
[00:17:17] Are the same differences between leading a gas station and a construction site? There's, so
[00:17:26] going from one construction site to another, there's little differences. I used to say that about
[00:17:31] seal platoons. Because like the difference between a seal platoon and another seal platoon are the
[00:17:36] same differences that you find. There's just going to be differences in those situations. The principles
[00:17:41] don't change. The principles don't change leading a construction site. The principles don't change
[00:17:45] leading a manufacturing line. The principles don't change leading a Girl Scout troop. Leadership is
[00:17:52] leadership. Moving on, in selecting a company in which to invest our savings, we often
[00:17:58] give primary consideration to the company with good leadership. In similar manner, a military unit is
[00:18:04] often judged by its leadership. Good leadership is essential to organize action where any group is
[00:18:12] involved. Now, if you were to dig down into this right here, I'm here to tell you, if you're going
[00:18:18] to invest in a company, the number one thing you should look at is what's the leadership like,
[00:18:25] because if they have a great product, groundbreaking product, but they have horrible leadership,
[00:18:31] it doesn't matter. Leadership should be the number one you component you look at. When we work with
[00:18:36] big investment groups, sometimes they're wanting us just to tell them, doing assessment, making
[00:18:43] assessment, what is this leadership pod like one of these humans like? Are they good leaders?
[00:18:51] Do they have capabilities? Do they have potential? Are they bad? Those are the questions.
[00:18:58] Continue on the one who commands, be he a military officer or captain of industry, must project
[00:19:04] power, an energizing power which coordinates and marshals the best efforts of his followers
[00:19:09] by supplying that certain something for which they look to him, be it guidance, support,
[00:19:14] encouragement, example, or even new ideas and imagination.
[00:19:22] Projecting power. That's an interesting concept. And look, I'd love to tell you, well, you know,
[00:19:27] let's know you didn't need to project but if you dig a little bit deeper on that statement,
[00:19:31] it's fairly accurate. Projection of power. Yeah. A peer powerful. Just saying, hey, I got this.
[00:19:38] We can do this. You know what I mean? I guess it's a form of confidence. Yeah. Which he talks
[00:19:44] about later, but I think that that projection of power and energizing power. That's what he's talking
[00:19:54] about, which coordinates and marshals the best efforts. You've seen this before, right? Let's just
[00:19:58] look into a kind of a generic situation. You see a group. They're not really focused. They're
[00:20:05] not really making anything happen. And all of a sudden, the leader steps up takes control,
[00:20:11] exhibits that power and they and marshals those people to move the same direction. That's
[00:20:15] what leadership is. You're watching American beauty. You're watching that movie. I have seen it,
[00:20:19] but I don't really remember. It's actually pretty good. But there's a part this guy, his name,
[00:20:25] was named, but he called himself the king of real estate. He's kind of an all one off character.
[00:20:32] And he said to the lady, I forget her name, something burn him. Anyway, it says to the lady,
[00:20:40] call me crazy, but it's my philosophy that in order to be successful, one must project an image
[00:20:48] of success at all times. Interesting. Super cheesy. And let's think about that, right? If you project
[00:20:57] an image of success all at all time, when are you projecting your vulnerability? When are you
[00:21:02] projecting your humility? If you're just walking around by the the the the the the murk.
[00:21:10] Right and you're rolling with the Rolex Mercedes. Okay, I understand. Rolling with the
[00:21:22] murk and the Rolex. The Rolex. The Rolex. Yeah, but I don't I don't I don't necessarily.
[00:21:30] I don't remember. I don't remember. When I heard that, I was like, probably you're just a
[00:21:34] composer. That's what all you do is it was like basically it was because like he just broke up with his girl. And then the lady was like,
[00:21:40] oh, I thought you guys were doing so well or whatever. And then he's like, it was alive. You're essentially
[00:21:45] yeah, it was like basically I put on an image of success to be successful in my business. I don't know,
[00:21:50] whatever. I got a better idea. If you want to be successful, why don't you be humble? Why don't you step
[00:21:58] up in work hard? There's a bunch of other better ways to be successful than pretending to be successful.
[00:22:04] I'm a throw that out there right now. I don't agree. Continuing on. The test of a leader lies in
[00:22:15] the reaction and response of his followers. That's straightforward. The reaction response. Look,
[00:22:25] if you're a leader and people don't react correctly, you're failing. He should not have to impose authority.
[00:22:34] Say it again. He should not have to impose authority. Bossingus in itself never made a leader.
[00:22:44] He must make his influence felt by example and the instilling of confidence in his followers.
[00:22:50] The greatness of a leader is measured by the achievements of the lead. This is the ultimate test of his effectiveness.
[00:22:59] You know, I think he brushes up against a lot of stuff. And this is like my third time reading through this
[00:23:05] today. And I keep I keep seeing little connections, right? I keep seeing little where he's brushing
[00:23:12] up against really important things and talking about him, talking about him, kind of passes through
[00:23:21] him, like mentions them. And some of them are perfect. He should not have to even impose authority.
[00:23:26] That's obvious. It's almost like he's uncomfortable saying it because he continues on by
[00:23:33] his hand he must make his influence felt by the example and instilling of confidence. So,
[00:23:36] see the thing that I have a prompt while I guess I don't know. Maybe you can help me.
[00:23:39] And still in confidence, what does that mean? There's a little bit of a lack of explanation behind that.
[00:23:48] We know what it means. Maybe this is why he says leadership is intangible. Because look,
[00:23:54] we say, hey, you want to instill confidence in your people. Great. Thank you.
[00:24:00] That's that goes without saying how do we actually do it? How do we actually do it? How do you
[00:24:05] and so confidence in people? Oh, how about you give them something that they can handle? Okay,
[00:24:10] that's a good thing. How about we take our team and we go out and we accomplish a pretty simple
[00:24:16] straightforward objective and our confidence goes up a little bit and then we handle more complicated
[00:24:20] one. We keep doing that and then we give subordinate leaders things. You see what I'm saying?
[00:24:24] This idea of just making people confident, instilling confidence in your followers,
[00:24:29] great. How do I do it? And by the way, that's leadership strategy in tactics. That is why I wrote
[00:24:36] leadership strategy in tactics. Because those questions right there, I realized there was a gap between,
[00:24:43] hey, build a relationship with your boss. That's great, Jocco. How do I do it? How am I supposed to
[00:24:52] do that? I was on EF online the other day and I said, I said, Jamie, because I was talking through
[00:24:58] someone, I said, I got the name, I got my next book and she was like, oh, great, because she's always
[00:25:04] mad because I'm doing too much. Yes. And I said, because we were talking to somebody about Ego,
[00:25:09] I put, oh yeah, I would give that personal Ego massage maneuver around plant the seeds, all this.
[00:25:12] And I said, my next book is going to be called, what was it? Ancient techniques of Ego massage therapy.
[00:25:22] Right? Because you could actually do that. You could say, hey, here's the person that you're
[00:25:25] dealing with. Here's how you want to massage that Ego. Here's another person. Here's another ancient
[00:25:29] technique of Ego massage. Yeah, that'd be actually really good. I know. No, I'm not even kidding.
[00:25:35] Because you know, you could tell someone, even now, like if they don't have the guidelines like a
[00:25:39] for real comprehensive, you know, instructional, they're going, it's so easy to take that kind of
[00:25:45] too far. You know, like, oh, just massage is Ego. Yeah, you go massage Ego do too much and
[00:25:49] the guy's like, probably this guy's kissing my ass right now or just trying to massage my Ego.
[00:25:52] Because this kind of part of Ego massage, effective Ego massage, they're not really
[00:25:57] knowing like that you're doing it for the sake of you. For sure. Yeah. For sure. If they know you're
[00:26:03] doing it, that's a really work as a sketch. Yeah. All right. Cool. I'm waiting for that book too. Yeah.
[00:26:11] Yeah. So I'll get, I'll get working on it. Get cracking. Maybe we'll just be a little,
[00:26:16] maybe just be a little short, little handbook, cup techniques for the troops out there.
[00:26:22] You know what I'll think of? I'll think of other ancient techniques that need explanations
[00:26:26] and I'll put them all in, let's say there's four sections. What do you mean ancient techniques?
[00:26:32] I'm just saying that. That's cool. Yeah, sounds cool. Yes, sir. Yeah. I probably could write a little
[00:26:38] book on that just by watching you do certain stuff. Well, you know what you can do to help me is you
[00:26:45] go, I saw you do this and then I can go into that exactly what I was doing and that would be helpful.
[00:26:49] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Because you get to see what's interesting for you is you see
[00:26:53] maneuvering happening on multiple different fronts. Yes. And I sit here and tell you hey, this is
[00:26:59] what's happening over here with this company. This is what the move is going to be. Watch out
[00:27:03] it unfolds and you're like, okay, and then you watch and you go, okay? Makes sense. Yes. Yes.
[00:27:08] All right. Continue moving on. Two frequently we use the words leader and commander
[00:27:18] synonymously. We should not forget that there are far more staff officers, staff officer
[00:27:24] assignments and there are command billets and a good staff officer can and should display the same
[00:27:29] leadership as a commander. While it takes a good staff officer to initiate an effective plan,
[00:27:35] it requires a leader to ensure that the plan is properly executed. This is good stuff that we're
[00:27:43] about to dive into. That is why you and I have been taught that the work of collecting information
[00:27:50] studying at drawing a plan and making a decision is 10% of the job. Seeing the plan through is the
[00:27:56] other 90% a well-trained officer is one who can serve effectively either as a staff officer or
[00:28:02] as a commander. So by a staff officer they mean the guy that's coming up and helping coming up
[00:28:05] and putting together the plan and going through logistics of it all. That's the staff officer and
[00:28:11] then there's the person that makes it happen. That executes it. That's the commander. It's interesting
[00:28:17] to think. This goes back to what we were talking about on the last podcast where I was saying,
[00:28:22] look, you're your commander and your troops, right? You're both of those things. So you can come
[00:28:28] up with great ideas in your little head. Beautiful plans. Amazing plans. Can you imagine how many
[00:28:36] people come up with plans that are actually freaking awesome but they never execute them?
[00:28:45] Think about that. That is a graveyard. A massive, infinite graveyard of incredibly good plans that
[00:28:52] never got executed on. The staff guy in their head, there's a nut see this is where the metaphor
[00:28:57] continues because you got a staff guy in your head that said, come on up with these little plans.
[00:29:01] Right? Coming up with these great plans. Hey if I start this work out. Hey if I start this business,
[00:29:06] hey if I can produce this thing, they come up with these staff officer coming up with great plans.
[00:29:11] Super. Good job. Unless that commander can get the troops in your head to execute it as no value
[00:29:18] whatsoever. And by the way, and we've talked about this, that idea by itself is zero value.
[00:29:25] Yeah. This is your old value. You come up with this great idea. Hey, Jocquai, thought of this new app.
[00:29:33] Right? Because everyone thinks of a new app every day. Hey, Jocquai, thought of this new app.
[00:29:38] It's game changer. Okay. Cool. Get it. How many of those things get executed?
[00:29:45] Yeah. Not many. So let me ask you this. Mr. opinion on this. So let's say
[00:29:51] me and another person. Right. Good. So okay. Let's say somebody says, hey, I have this great idea
[00:29:59] and tells you. You know, and it's an, and I, it's a good idea actually. And it says,
[00:30:04] this is how I'm going to execute, you know, whatever. Actually, there's so many different scenarios.
[00:30:09] But okay, this one. Okay. Here's my plan. And it's a, I'm starting to worry about the execution of
[00:30:15] this very idea. So we watch this unfold. Let's see what's happening. Okay. And then I don't have
[00:30:23] the capability to execute this plan at all. You know, there are other people who do, but it's just my
[00:30:27] idea. It's my idea. I don't know. I've got pill vacures, cancer, I don't know anything. But let's say,
[00:30:33] I have that idea to tell you. And then you're like, oh, yeah, good idea. And then years go by
[00:30:39] and I never execute. I never call somebody up to help execute it. You know, I'm just done.
[00:30:44] That was just my idea that I intended it. He went into the graveyard. Then he said, and then
[00:30:51] you say, then is a good idea. I unlike you have the capability to actually execute most of this.
[00:30:59] And I know the other guy who can execute the rest. Meanwhile, me, I don't, I don't have any
[00:31:03] capability. And I don't know anyone. I'd have to go shopping for my N.A. simply didn't do it.
[00:31:07] Right. Let's say you say, okay, and you execute the plan and be successful in your new thing.
[00:31:11] Mm-hmm. Right. Is that like a violation or how do you feel about that? Because you know that happens a lot.
[00:31:18] Right. Yeah, it definitely happens a lot. And it paints the reality. And what's interesting,
[00:31:22] you've heard the term idea guy? Oh, yes. Like, oh, that person's a good idea guy.
[00:31:27] Want to head. But it's kind of, it's kind of a pejorative, right? Oh, that guy? Well,
[00:31:32] that guy's an idea guy. Meaning like, hey, that guy can't really make anything happening.
[00:31:36] Good. You can sit around here and spout off good ideas. That's great. So funny.
[00:31:40] That's great. But you don't actually execute on any of them. Yeah. Which is just,
[00:31:45] what do I think should happen? Quite honestly, I guess in a perfect world, that person that came
[00:31:51] up with the idea and didn't execute it, he's paying the price for not making it happen. And the price
[00:31:56] is you watch somebody else, you know, go and and do well with your idea because you didn't execute.
[00:32:03] Right. So he's going to think, let's, let's say the, let's say I'm the idea guy in this
[00:32:07] particular scenario and you're the, you're the guy who can actually make it happen. Right.
[00:32:11] Usually the idea guy is going to be kind of salty because he's like, hey, I told you that the whole idea,
[00:32:17] you know, not how to do it, but just the idea like that was my idea, you know, like on
[00:32:23] sign field, it was my idea for the colon that smells like the beach anyway. Okay. It's a thing. But
[00:32:29] usually that's why that guy's salty, right? Yeah, he's mad. Yeah, he's mad. But the reality is,
[00:32:35] like, Brad not only did you not execute, like, I don't even know if you could. Really. Yeah,
[00:32:41] there's a weird thing there because if you don't have, you said two things. You don't have to
[00:32:46] keep the ability of executing, which is a little bit different than don't have not having the
[00:32:50] will to execute. Yeah. So this, what I meant was, you don't like, okay, so I get this, this whole scenario
[00:32:57] is actually like a real scenario that happens all the time. Back when I used to make websites,
[00:33:01] like, I'd hear it all the time or at my brother, J, he makes apps. So when you say,
[00:33:06] you're going to go to school, I'd different, you know, oh, that's a real thing. And everybody's calling
[00:33:10] him, like, I got this idea for this app, right? Meanwhile, they know nothing about what they're doing
[00:33:14] at all. Like they're like, oh, this is, it wouldn't be cool to have an app that can read people's minds.
[00:33:19] Or that's not a real one, but I'm just saying, meanwhile, they have no idea about making apps
[00:33:24] first off. They have no idea about mind reading, second off. And they have no idea about, like,
[00:33:28] anything else, you know, they're like, but they're like, that's a cool idea. Let me call the app
[00:33:32] that, you know, and then so most of the time it's like, even if that were a good idea, which it's not,
[00:33:36] but even if it was, I don't need you for that to do it. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, and there's a
[00:33:43] weird thing there because there's also people that don't have any good ideas, but that are
[00:33:48] really good at execution. Yeah. So what I recommend you do is you form up your team where you have
[00:33:55] people that have ideas and people that can execute those ideas. Yeah. So you compliment each other.
[00:34:01] You work with someone that can actually make things happen. I couldn't make this podcast.
[00:34:06] I didn't know how to press record. You know, I didn't know how to. I didn't know what piece of
[00:34:11] equipment we're going to need. I couldn't execute it. I have an idea. Hey, I think we should do
[00:34:17] bad. That's the exact same thing you're talking about right now. Now, I could have sat in my closet
[00:34:22] by myself going, I had going to do a cool podcast about war and human nature and it would be so good.
[00:34:29] I could sat there for five years with this idea and someone else would come out. Maybe I
[00:34:34] would have told somebody and they would be like, I'm going to execute on that. What did I do?
[00:34:37] I actually said, oh, I don't have the capability to execute this by myself. Fine.
[00:34:42] Echo Charles, do you know how to make a podcast? Yes, I can figure it out. Cool. We're making a podcast.
[00:34:47] That's an example. Right? I can't execute it by myself.
[00:34:50] And it doesn't matter to me. I'm not caught up on the fact that because there's people that sit
[00:34:55] on ideas, they won't tell me, they're not selling this NDA. Right? I've signed so many NDAs
[00:35:03] for people to tell me they're brilliant ideas and I go stealing. Yes, I won't steal it.
[00:35:09] And it's like, okay, cool. Very few of them. I feel bad. People are listening to this
[00:35:16] story. You said an NDA. There's some good ideas out there. Right? But a lot of them are number one,
[00:35:22] the real obvious, you know, I've had people hit me well again. Hey, man, I'm already doing that or
[00:35:27] hey, that's in the works or whatever because it's just sorry. Oh, you know, but that's a classic example.
[00:35:35] Look, I know I can't execute. I'm not going to sit. You don't long as sat on the idea of having
[00:35:38] a podcast not very long. I want to have one who can help me execute this Echo Charles. Boom.
[00:35:43] Yeah. Yeah. Man, I always, I kind of feel it's weird because when you think about it, let's say,
[00:35:52] I don't know, you're a lot more mature than most of us. I do them 48 years old. I'm not saying
[00:35:58] I'm saying you're at it too. I'm saying you're at it too. Not your physical being, uh,
[00:36:04] you know how you're saying, even at 48 years old, you don't think of like, oh, this guy's mature.
[00:36:08] He actually just, oh, you know what I mean? You say someone that's a 20 one. You go all these pretty or
[00:36:14] actually like 17, you know, he's pretty mature kid, right? Oh, okay. I know, and so
[00:36:19] but the reason I'm saying is you understand because this, this immaturity versus maturity applies to
[00:36:24] it no matter what age. So let's say, all right, I'm going to use me. I'm not saying I'm like this. I'm not saying
[00:36:30] I'm not like this, but I'm going to use me as the example. Yeah, so I'm like, let's say that I'm like, hey,
[00:36:35] you know, I'd be a great idea. Just impassing to like, I don't know, my friend or whatever. Let's say he's a
[00:36:40] surfer or surfer or surfer or cheaper or something and maybe an engineer too, you know, and
[00:36:45] I'm like, oh, you need to be a great idea for a surfer or the little motor on there. So I don't know
[00:36:50] whatever. We'll just say a motor on there. That does this and that. You know, like just impassing,
[00:36:57] right, that's my cool idea. First off, not only do I not know anything about surfer board making,
[00:37:03] it's like, I didn't really even mean like you should really do that and let's go into business. I didn't
[00:37:08] mean anything like tie to set it. Meanwhile, it's stuck in the guy's head where he's like, yeah, I could
[00:37:13] totally do that and no one's doing that and he does it becomes massively successful, right? Most of us
[00:37:21] will have at least 1% of our little brain saying like, oh man, like, that's my idea. Like, I
[00:37:28] deserve part of it and you know what? If you, if I was the surfered, shaper, mechanical engineer guy
[00:37:34] and you gave me that idea and I was successful, I would give you reward. I would take care of you.
[00:37:40] I feel like cool. I think that's, I think that's the right thing to do actually. Yeah, I think
[00:37:44] something special. But, it would probably be out a different proportion than you think, because people
[00:37:51] with ideas always think that they think that they, they think that the idea is the hard part. Yeah,
[00:37:55] that's the everything, the idea without an idea, there's nothing, right? Right, without an idea, there's
[00:37:59] nothing. However, they're both equally important. But the idea usually gets less in the investment world,
[00:38:07] your good idea gets you like 10%. It doesn't get you 90%. A lot of people think that the idea should
[00:38:12] get them 90%. It doesn't get you 90%. It gets you 10%. It gets you 15%. Yeah, and under certain circumstances,
[00:38:20] yeah, of course. Mainly, I'm thrown out there as kind of a generality. I agree with you even 110%.
[00:38:26] You think I could agree with you 110%. Apparently, I think the idea part of it is worth less.
[00:38:32] All right, because everyone, it's like, okay, okay, here's my idea. I'm saying it publicly. Straight up.
[00:38:38] Here's my idea. A pill that cures cancer. Just cures it.
[00:38:44] Just saying. That's a good idea, right? See, I'll kind of blame that that is,
[00:38:49] like, okay, so now one freaking, look, and not only did a million training people already have that idea,
[00:38:56] as far as an idea goes, like, I have no capability of executing this. Maybe I could get, like,
[00:39:02] yeah, I think that's kind of a bad example. Well, it's an extreme thing that better one. No,
[00:39:07] it's an extreme example. It's so extreme that it doesn't make, it doesn't make the point.
[00:39:11] You didn't think of something a little bit better. Well, all these app ideas are like kind of like that.
[00:39:18] It's like, you don't even, most of us don't know even how apps work. As far as making them.
[00:39:23] Yeah, you know what else is interesting is a lot of times the first company that has an idea and
[00:39:30] investment and pushes it. A lot of times they aren't the ones that are actually successful with that, with that idea.
[00:39:36] It takes another someone to take it to the next level. The MP3 players
[00:39:43] Apple didn't invent those. There was other companies that made MP3 players and then Apple came and
[00:39:49] made it into the iPod and it was super successful. So there's a lot of times where the idea
[00:39:55] phase just to get that thing launched and then someone else looks over and goes, yeah, that's a pretty good
[00:39:59] idea or jumping on it or jumping in the game. Yeah, and that kind of goes back to it in a way. So,
[00:40:06] you know how back to what you said where it's like, okay, if you got an idea from somebody and then
[00:40:11] you actually executed the idea and made successful when they had no capability or intention by the way.
[00:40:17] And you became massively successful when you'd pay them or whatever. I would be cool. But what if you
[00:40:24] didn't know the person? What if you heard the idea on like you're watching, I don't know,
[00:40:29] project or unwares something and you heard like one of the people say an idea just in passing to their
[00:40:34] friend on the show. You don't know them or nothing. I don't know. If you contact them and be like,
[00:40:38] hey, friends in hell, successful. I was a massive, massive, you'd one billion dollars. Yeah, I'd
[00:40:44] try and contact that person and be like, hey, I got this idea from you. Yeah, I don't think I would.
[00:40:48] Yeah, I think I would. I'm pretty, that's what I'm saying about that maturity, but I'm very mature.
[00:40:54] You're very mature person. Trying to take care of people if you know if they deserve it.
[00:40:59] And if you come up with a great idea, even though you did nothing to execute it, what if the idea is bothering me?
[00:41:04] Oh, yeah, sure. Especially when they do all the time. What if someone had the idea and
[00:41:10] forgive me for stringing this out? But I'm trying to see, I'm trying to identify your threshold.
[00:41:15] You seem to see. What if the idea was said by someone that you don't know
[00:41:22] in passing and it was a joke? It wasn't even like a for idea. Like it was a joke. Like you're like,
[00:41:28] oh, we should invent a parachute that can spring a motor and take you, I don't know,
[00:41:35] something kind of ridiculous. But when you thought about your like, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:41:39] that's not where you did. I could actually do that. You did it. You know, they're totally joking.
[00:41:43] In fact, they were kind of mocking it. Then would you reward him? You got that idea from that?
[00:41:47] I don't know. I'd have the more specifics on the scenario. All right. But if people hit me with
[00:41:52] good ideas, I will take care of them. You know, pretty straightforward. All right. Go on back to
[00:41:59] the book. That's a rough. I can recall a former vice president of one of the companies with which I
[00:42:09] am associated. He would formulate some good plans, but never followed up to see that his plans
[00:42:14] got the expected results. I knew he had served in World War II. So out of curiosity, I looked into
[00:42:21] the nature of his service and found that his entire period of service was a staff officer. He had
[00:42:26] never had the advantage of a command job. So his training was incomplete. Maybe if he had remained
[00:42:31] in the service longer, he would have developed his leadership qualities as well. And this man
[00:42:35] would still be with the company. So if you're not able to execute things, your ID, this is now
[00:42:42] see now I'm starting to get mad because because it does bother me when people just want to throw
[00:42:47] on ideas and they don't push him to completion. That's that's unsat. That's unsat. And yeah,
[00:42:54] you didn't even talk about that could deal to. We're talking about that, too. It's like a sin.
[00:42:58] Yeah. You don't follow through. And all this. So and that is true, which kind of takes me back to
[00:43:03] what about that idea guy who's like you stole my idea, right? It's like it kind of makes that
[00:43:09] thing a little bit more angry. Like it makes you mad a little bit more. One of the
[00:43:15] person is like, hey, that was my idea. It's like, you're like, you're you're a low utility person.
[00:43:20] You don't execute on anything ever. And now this was your idea and you somehow deserve something
[00:43:27] for the success of the idea. Meanwhile, you provided in my opinion, less than 1% of the ideas
[00:43:34] success. Yeah. Yeah. When you get into these hypothetical scenarios where the person is basically
[00:43:41] not really creating the idea for the purpose of being executed, maybe that's the line. But if you're
[00:43:46] creating an idea in your acting, if you've created an idea in your actively trying to get people
[00:43:50] executed on it, I'll probably I will take care of you. If you're not even intentionally trying to
[00:43:55] create something, first of all, you're used not no factor in the world. Like how would I even know
[00:44:01] who you are? You're not you don't even step up. You don't leave a trail of, hey, that connects you
[00:44:06] to this idea. Yeah. So it's no factor. Actually, zero factor. The person is just unsat.
[00:44:15] You may have heard heard this story about General Persia in World War I, while inspecting a
[00:44:20] certain area, he found a project that was not going too well. Even though a second lieutenant
[00:44:24] in charge seemed to have a pretty good plan. General Persia asked the lieutenant how much pay you received.
[00:44:29] When the lieutenant replied, $141.67 per month, sir. General Persia said, just remember that you
[00:44:35] get a dollar 67 for making your plan an issuing the order and $140 for seeing that it's carried out.
[00:44:44] Yeah, you need people like that. And I'll tell you, this is another thing,
[00:44:50] would that go in the next book? Well, maybe not the next book. It'll go into the next ancient
[00:44:56] technique book. I'm going to ancient technique will be getting things, getting the troops to execute
[00:45:02] the plan. How do you do that? Because this is again, he brushes up against these things.
[00:45:10] Like, hey, we all know that it sucks that if your team isn't doing what they're supposed to do,
[00:45:13] how do we actually get them to do it? Right? What are the leadership strategy and tactics,
[00:45:18] which some of which I do talk about in leadership strategy and tactics, how you get the people
[00:45:23] to actually get the job done that you want them to do. And part of it has to do with, you know,
[00:45:28] this guy seemed to have come up with a pretty good plan. Well, if you let your troops come up,
[00:45:31] the plan, there's going to be a better chance of the execute it. As we know,
[00:45:36] so that might go into the ancient ancient procedures. Ancient techniques.
[00:45:44] You remember that video that I was in where I was talking about the ancient masters? Yes,
[00:45:52] the ancient masters. And I said something where you said to me, I could tell you were reaching
[00:45:57] for a word. Because I said something like, let me summon the power of the, and I didn't know what
[00:46:04] to say. I paid it by myself in the corner, and I said, the ancients, which by the way, may have been
[00:46:11] brood in my head from tenacious D, because he's got one of their, one of their, or the HBO
[00:46:18] specials, they talk about the ancients. And that's exactly what it came from. I had to summon
[00:46:24] up the D. They came through at the moment of truth. Because that, those videos, that particular video,
[00:46:36] for somebody's number, a little bit more, I have a little bit more fun when I'm annoyed.
[00:46:43] A little bit of a disillot. A little bit of no mocking in or something. So what happened was
[00:46:47] the female who was prompting me with different questions? She says, you know, so tell me, tell
[00:46:56] me what you do to get up in the morning. And I said, well, what I do is I sent my alarm clock,
[00:47:01] and I, when it goes off, I get out of bed, which is my standard answer I give in a thousand times.
[00:47:05] And then she says, no, no, no, but she said something along lines, and she was super cool.
[00:47:09] She said something along lines of, no, but I mean, I think my producers, can you give my producer more
[00:47:15] than that? And that's what I went into this whole thing. But it was just off the top of my head.
[00:47:21] But I got stuck for a word and the D delivered for me. Yes. So now there's me whole book connected
[00:47:28] to that. See that levels. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. All right, continuing on. He's, so we started
[00:47:37] about the person thing. You get paid $140. You get paid $1.67 from making the plan. You get paid $140
[00:47:45] for seeing that is carried out. He says, I'm not sure that I would go to that extreme.
[00:47:48] Certainly in these days, problems are complex and good staff work, plays a large part about
[00:47:53] resolving them. I have known commanders who are not too smart, but they were very knowledgeable about
[00:47:59] personnel and who knew enough to select the very best for their staffs. Remember, a good leader is
[00:48:05] one who causes or inspires others staff or subordinate commanders to do the job. Boy, I've known
[00:48:15] commanders who are not too smart, but they were very knowledgeable. There's, I know there's all kinds
[00:48:21] of like literature about this kind of thing, but there's different kinds of intelligence, right?
[00:48:27] Absolutely, different kinds of intelligence. And one of the least most important types of
[00:48:34] intelligence is book smart. When it comes to operating in the real world, one of the least
[00:48:42] important types of intelligence is, hey, I can memorize this for a test or I can understand these
[00:48:48] kind of, if you can't read people, if you don't have the emotional intelligence, if you don't
[00:48:55] aren't able to react, if you aren't able to control your own emotion, there's about a million things.
[00:48:59] Yeah. So you can be not too smart and still do outstanding, especially if you're smart enough to
[00:49:09] go, you know what, I'm not that smart, but I got, I got Fred over here. You get some brain horse power,
[00:49:16] I'm gonna bring him on the team. I'm not gonna put him up in front of the troops because he
[00:49:20] fumbles around with his words, but I'm gonna have him going through my plan line by line,
[00:49:27] check in the numbers, making sure we're good to go, build the right team.
[00:49:34] Furthermore, no leader knows it all, although sometimes you find one who seems to think he does,
[00:49:40] a leader should encourage the members of his staff to speak up if they think their commander is wrong.
[00:49:45] He should invite constructive criticism. It is a grave error for the leader to surround himself with a
[00:49:51] yes staff. Hence, no yes men, leadership strategy and tactics, do not surround yourself with
[00:50:01] yes men, speaking of ideas that have been stolen Omar Bradley. I stole that idea, I guess, and put it in a book.
[00:50:13] General George C. Marshall was an excellent exponent of the principle of having his
[00:50:18] support and speak up. When he first came to Chief Staff, when he first became Chief of Staff of the
[00:50:23] Army, the Secretary of that office consisted of three officers who presented early to General Marshall,
[00:50:28] the staff papers or studies coming from the divisions of the General Staff. I was a member of that
[00:50:33] secretary. We presented in a abbreviated form the contents of the staff studies, citing the highlights
[00:50:40] of the problem involved, the various possible courses of actions, considered, and the action
[00:50:45] recommended. At the end of his first week as Chief of Staff, Marshall called us into his office and
[00:50:50] opened the discussion by saying, I am disappointed in all of you. When we inquired, if we might ask
[00:50:57] why, he said, you haven't disagreed with a single thing I have done all week. We told him it just
[00:51:04] so happened that we were in full agreement with every paper that had been presented, that we knew
[00:51:08] he wanted and that we would add our comments to anything that we considered should be questioned.
[00:51:13] In the very next day, we presented a paper as written and then expressed some thoughts which,
[00:51:17] in our own opinion, made the recommendation recommended action questionable. General Marshall said,
[00:51:23] now that is what I want. Unless I hear all the arguments against an action, I am not sure whether I am
[00:51:30] right or not. You don't want us around yourself with those people that are just going to tell you
[00:51:37] that right. Anyway, you feel that or you see that with the celebrities that surround themselves,
[00:51:47] with the people that just tell them, hey, you're the greatest, you're super, you can do whatever you
[00:51:51] want, and then you're watching on the downward spiral of destruction. They need someone going, hey,
[00:51:58] bro, stop. That's dumb. You might be able to get away with it, but you're not going to get away
[00:52:05] with it for long. And it's going to be hanging over you. That doesn't happen. They get surrounded by
[00:52:10] people that just blindly support them. Do you feel that it's like, I guess, when you think about it,
[00:52:16] it seems like a two-way street, right? Like the person, okay, so you don't want to surround yourself
[00:52:22] with just men, right? And let's say you happen for like a better way of putting it, you happened
[00:52:26] to not surround yourself with yes, yes, men. It's not like you actively were like, hey,
[00:52:31] you're a yes man, and I don't really hang out with you. I just put it up with Fred and he's like,
[00:52:36] we'll push back and say, Dave, you trust him because you're both your friend or whatever, right?
[00:52:43] Versus the person who's like actively surrounding themselves with people were not yes men,
[00:52:51] right? But the two-way street kind of goes where if I'm not saying celebrities are like this,
[00:52:56] but some people in the world are like this where it's like, hey, and maybe they don't consciously
[00:53:02] think of it this way. They just go by their feeling and they're like, hey, this person doesn't agree
[00:53:06] with me like all the time. Like this person does. And when this person agrees with me all the time,
[00:53:11] it really makes me feel good. And this is just the feeling. They're not consciously,
[00:53:15] you're saying, you're saying that someone may just by small decision after small decision, after small
[00:53:22] decision over time, they just end up getting rid of everyone that gives them any objections.
[00:53:28] Yes. I think that's exactly what happens. I think that's why you have to proactively
[00:53:34] make sure you've got people on your team that are going to push back. You know, and I just was
[00:53:40] on the EF online today, I was talking about the fact that I was hyper paranoid about making sure
[00:53:49] I took input from other people. There was the when the seals went into Panama. They went into
[00:53:56] Petia Airfield was a rough operation lost four seals. And I worked for a guy that was there.
[00:54:07] He was on the boats that that put the seals in. And so he had been through the whole planning process
[00:54:14] and everything. And I asked him, I said, you know, what happened? He explained to me that what
[00:54:20] happened tactically on the ground. And I was kind of, okay, I get that. I was, I said,
[00:54:27] but how did you, how did that plan? Because the plan seemed like it had some, some violations of
[00:54:34] sort of fundamental, like normal tactics that seals use. And he just said that there was a
[00:54:42] couple of guys that kind of work, no, this is what we're going to do in this work. It's going to work.
[00:54:46] And there wasn't a lot of push back against it. So I always felt that it was really critical
[00:54:56] that you want push back and that you listen to it. Because if, you know, all those seals and,
[00:55:02] you know, those heroic guys that died on that airfield, if a plan can get through all those guys,
[00:55:10] all those seals, then we need to make sure our minds are open and we're listening and taking
[00:55:16] input. Because otherwise, if you, if you come up with a plan that you think is great.
[00:55:21] Now, when you hear a question about it, you've got to listen to the question. You've got to listen
[00:55:25] to the question. So it's, for that it's a hard trick. Like, you know, when you come out with a plan
[00:55:33] or an idea or whatever of video, whatever. And you show it to someone or you present it,
[00:55:40] and here's the thing, when you come up with a comprehensive plan that you're happy about,
[00:55:44] you're fired up, you know, I know what you're going with us and you're like saying how hard it is.
[00:55:48] I am so conditioned at this point to be paranoid. I was trying to figure out where that came from
[00:55:58] in my head and it came from that situation from hearing that guy who ended up, I ended up working
[00:56:04] for hearing him explain to me, hey, there wasn't enough pushback and we went forward with a plan
[00:56:11] that not everyone agreed with. And you think, I thought to myself, I'm never going to, so at this
[00:56:16] point, I come up with a plan for anything which normally, as you know, I try not to, I try to let
[00:56:20] out of everybody else come up with a plan. But sometimes I do come up with a plan. And I'm so comfortable
[00:56:27] with someone saying, hey, I don't like that. It doesn't have any impact on me whatsoever. So
[00:56:31] easy for me to say, actually the right point didn't think of that. Yeah, man, that's so good because
[00:56:36] you, and you, you know, you've put it, you're the one who put it like this where it's like you don't
[00:56:40] emotionally attach yourself to the plan. But I guess that's the really the point that's hard.
[00:56:45] I watched seal, but tune after seal, but tune after seal, but tune, get so wrapped around the
[00:56:53] axle of the plan of my plan. My plan. And you know, normally at the end of the day,
[00:57:00] and this is when I was running training, I would watch, because I'd sit there and watch
[00:57:03] and plan and you're, I'm defacto detached because I'm sitting back watching them plan. But you would
[00:57:09] see them just go down the road of arguing with each other about my plan versus your plan.
[00:57:15] Both the plans are work fine. I'll tell you what, won't work. It's trying to plant, do the plan
[00:57:19] in 20 minutes because you've wasted four hours arguing about which plan is better. And I would
[00:57:25] see that all the time. Yeah, you know, that yeah, I feel, I'm not going to say I've gone through this.
[00:57:31] I'm not going to say I've not gone through this, but you know, you show someone a video that you
[00:57:36] might have made or whatever. And you're like you say, hey, you know, tell me what you think of this
[00:57:42] video before you release it or something like that. And really, when you really be honest, this is
[00:57:47] what it is. Half of your brain is like, hey, I need some feedback to make it the best I can.
[00:57:52] And let me give you a look just so I can get some good feedback, you know, on improving it, that's
[00:57:56] half. The other half of your brain is kind of like, hey, this is kind of the premiere a little bit.
[00:58:01] And I want to get rewarded for my work, you know, with, with, you know, praise and hopefully
[00:58:08] applause or something, you know, kind of like that. So it's like your two sides of your brain.
[00:58:11] So one, when you do have to get feedback, where it's like, hey, I would improve this. I would
[00:58:17] do this or at that beginning, got to change it or whatever. That second part of your brain is
[00:58:21] kind of like, bro, why did I even show it to you? Like you're not even looking
[00:58:24] being cool about it, you know, kind of, kind of an attitude, you know, that's the part.
[00:58:28] Once again, this is where humility is so important, because otherwise you just don't
[00:58:35] improve anything. I don't know. Hey, if I show someone a piece of writing and they go, yeah,
[00:58:39] you know, I like this, but you can do this different. I'm like, okay, cool. And sometimes,
[00:58:43] I just wrote a piece and I sent it to one of my editors and look, I will say they wrote 100
[00:58:54] things. Well, let's say they wrote 50 things. Of the 50 things that they wrote, I accepted,
[00:59:01] I don't know, 93% of them. There was one major change. The only, the most significant
[00:59:08] change in the piece. And I said, hey, I appreciate the feedback. I'm not changing that thing.
[00:59:15] And it wasn't because of Eagle, it's like, okay, I read it five times and said, you know what?
[00:59:19] That's absolutely needs to be in there. And I saw her perspective and said, you know what?
[00:59:26] I get where she's coming from, but this ties everything together. And I think that's what I
[00:59:33] didn't do a good job explaining to her. But yes, you have to at least be open to it. You have to
[00:59:42] at least be open to it. Yeah, yeah, admitting to yourself that you're like, and going to it with the
[00:59:47] attitude of, hey, I have to actually strongly be able to defend my position. And if I can't defend my
[00:59:55] position, then you're probably right, right, like on a logical level almost. Yeah, not like,
[01:00:00] hey, that was cool. You put down that my writing, you know, like not that added. Yeah, you know,
[01:00:06] Mike, just like I say, well, my goal is to listen to if you and I are working together and I'm in
[01:00:12] charge and we're going to attack a target. My goal is to have you come up with the plan. That's my
[01:00:16] absolute goal. When you come to the plan, I'm not looking at it. What's wrong with it? I'm saying,
[01:00:20] what's right with it? I like it. I like your plan better than what I thought I was going to think.
[01:00:25] When you bring me a piece of, when I bring you a piece of writing and you give me feedback,
[01:00:30] my goal is to go, okay, your feedback is correct and I'm wrong. And unless it just
[01:00:38] pains me to change something, then I'm going to lean towards your recommendation. Yeah,
[01:00:46] that's a good way to look at it. It's like you're writing or whatever, you're completed to work
[01:00:51] that you need feedback on. It's like you just, if you go in automatic, the regarding it as this,
[01:00:56] there's a problem with this. There's holes in this, it's missing stuff and it has too much of
[01:01:01] some other stuff. Yeah. I know that for a fact and it that upsets me. I'm going to go to this person
[01:01:07] and they can identify them, these things. That's it. Yeah. Not how awesome it is. It's like,
[01:01:13] there's a problem with this and I need this problem to be solving this person and tell it.
[01:01:17] I was listening to Brian Kaufman on Tim Ferriss's podcast. Brian Kaufman and David Levine
[01:01:24] are the writers of the show, Billions. Have you heard of the show? I have. I hear good things.
[01:01:31] But it was interesting because Brian Kaufman, I wish I could remember exactly what he said.
[01:01:36] There's two things that he said. Number one, if he's going to give somebody something for feedback
[01:01:41] on something that he's written, you don't give someone their completed project and say,
[01:01:48] hey, can you give me some feedback on this because I already finished it. What you're really asking,
[01:01:53] if I say, hey, echo, I wrote this book. Can you give me some feedback on it? Yeah. That's sort of
[01:02:01] it's sort of a bad thing. I have to say, hey, echo. This is just a draft. Yeah. And then he had
[01:02:06] some response of saying something like, do you want me to read it? Or do you want feedback? He had
[01:02:13] some way of saying, hey, you want me to really go to town on this thing or do you just want me to
[01:02:18] read it? You just want me to watch this video that you made or do you want feedback? How was
[01:02:24] I could think, would you say something something, do you want professional feedback or something like that?
[01:02:28] Something that was, hey, look, if I give this to you straight, it's going to sting. Yeah,
[01:02:35] that's the man. That's so good. Because it's almost like they're because they're two different people.
[01:02:39] They're two different roles you're asking this person to be. Do you want this person to be an audience member?
[01:02:45] Exactly. I can. Or do you want your own trick? And credit or editor or assistant? What
[01:02:50] you want? Yeah. So it's just two different attitudes. And that's, yeah, that's the emotional
[01:02:55] ego part versus the, you know, the technician or whatever the other guy is. Yeah. So those are
[01:03:01] you got to get that humble brain going. If you want to ask people for feedback and anything.
[01:03:07] And it stings every single time. So it works. Go back to the book. If you happen to be a
[01:03:15] detailed, detailed to a staff, trying to be a good staff officer and if possible, avoid being a
[01:03:19] yes man. I would suggest to all commanders that they inform the members of their staffs that
[01:03:24] anyone who does not agree once in a while with what is about to be done is of limited value and
[01:03:30] perhaps should be shifted to some other place where he might occasionally have an idea.
[01:03:36] Over here, just an agreement all the time. I don't need you. I don't need you.
[01:03:45] Of course, I'm thinking about the decision making process. After a decision is made, everyone must be
[01:03:50] 100% behind it. I thought the British were admirable in this respect during World War II, no
[01:03:56] matter how much discussion they're had been on a subject. As soon as a decision was made, you never
[01:04:00] heard any doubts expressed. You had to believe that everyone involved in making that decision
[01:04:05] had never entertained any ideas except those expressed in this decision. You know how I used
[01:04:09] to explain this to the young junior officers, because I used to say once a decision is made,
[01:04:15] you executed as if it was your own. Now here's where people will freak out about that, right?
[01:04:22] They freak out about that because they think, but what if I don't really agree with it?
[01:04:26] If you don't really agree with it, check a couple things. Number one, if echo comes up with a plan
[01:04:33] and you're my boss and you're telling me how we're going to do something and I'm like, no, we need
[01:04:36] to do it this way. The first thing I need to check, and finally you're like, no, we're doing it this
[01:04:40] way. That's the decision we're going forward. The first thing I need to check is, what do you think
[01:04:43] it is? Take a guess. Yes, I need to check my ego. Because I would say upwards of 90%
[01:04:50] 90% of the time, the only reason I disagree is because of my ego. Because I got some little
[01:04:56] idea and I think my way would be better. And even if my way is better, it's not drastically
[01:05:03] better because we're both fighting for the same cause. Right? How often is it a boss is like,
[01:05:10] hey, we want to execute this way and someone says, hey, that's a really horrible way to do.
[01:05:15] It's going to be unsafe for the team members and it's going to not, it's going to lose money. And
[01:05:21] the boss, because I don't care. No, we're doing it my way. No, he goes, wait, wait a second,
[01:05:25] what are you talking about? Explain this to me. How is it unsafe and how are we going to lose money?
[01:05:28] So the idea is, first thing you check is, is it my ego that's preventing me from accepting
[01:05:36] this new idea? What are the degrees of variance between my idea and the way it's actually happening?
[01:05:43] Because if the degrees of variance are minimal, then shut up and go and execute the plan as if it
[01:05:48] was your own. Now, if there are significant degrees of variance where it's going to be a really bad
[01:05:55] situation and I hate to use the word catastrophic. But certainly, if you see a catastrophic problem,
[01:05:59] then you go, hey, we cannot do this. This is not good. And you don't go forward if it's going to be
[01:06:07] catastrophic or again, go back to leadership strategy. And taxes and you've got to make it as
[01:06:11] then you've got to figure out, is it better for me to go ahead with it? But now I can go mitigate the damage,
[01:06:16] mitigate the risk as much as possible. That might be what you have to do. So
[01:06:22] that idea of executing as if you believe it as if it's your own, which is what you should do.
[01:06:28] You need to have those conversations. Listen, put your ego in check and then if it's close enough,
[01:06:34] you go Roger that. Boss, I'm on board with the plan. Let's go execute it. And you do
[01:06:38] execute it as if it's your own. No factor. Continuing on, I don't want to over-emphasize
[01:06:47] leadership of senior officers. So you just don't want to just talk about senior officers.
[01:06:52] My interest extends to leaders of all ranks. I would caution you to remember that an essential
[01:06:57] qualification of a good leader is the ability to recognize, select, and train junior officers.
[01:07:01] I would like to quote from a book entitled, The Born at Reveley, written by Colonel Red Reader.
[01:07:09] Colonel Reader was on a trip for general martial and one of his assignments was to
[01:07:14] inquire into junior leadership. This is an account of his conversation with Colonel Bryant Moore
[01:07:21] on Guadalcanal. Quote, Colonel Moore, I said, tell me something about leadership.
[01:07:26] I had hit a sensitive spot. Colonel Moore forged ahead leadership. The greatest problem here is
[01:07:34] the leaders. And you have to find some way to weed out the weak ones. It is tough to do this
[01:07:39] when you're in combat. The platoon leaders who cannot command, who cannot foresee things,
[01:07:44] and who cannot act on the spur of the moment in an emergency are a distinct detriment.
[01:07:51] This is clear, right? We know this. But there you have it reinforced for the one million
[01:07:57] time. If you've got weak leaders, you're going to have problems. If you can't command,
[01:08:02] if you can't foresee things, and if you can't act on spur of the moment,
[01:08:08] you're going to have problems. When's the last time you heard that's a negative thing, right?
[01:08:11] Oh, he acts on the spur of the moment. Actually, there's sometimes where you need to do that.
[01:08:16] He continues on. It's hot here as you can see men struggle. They get heat exhaustion.
[01:08:20] They come out vomiting and throwing away equipment. The leaders must be leaders.
[01:08:26] And they must be alert enough to establish straggler lines and stop this thing.
[01:08:32] And I need to do, I try to research this in order of the book.
[01:08:38] If the book is actually for sale, it's called Born and Reveal.
[01:08:41] It got some interesting reviews. It seems like a good book, where they say,
[01:08:45] I guess it's written in some offensive language in modern era.
[01:08:51] So, but I, because I wasn't really a hundred percent. The leaders must be leaders,
[01:08:56] and that they must be alert enough to establish straggler lines and stop this thing.
[01:09:02] I guess he's talking about heat exhaustion, right? He must be.
[01:09:06] straggler lines are lines of people that aren't ready to fight and stop this thing.
[01:09:11] I'm assuming he's talking about the heat exhaustion. So it goes on. And this is why I think that's what
[01:09:16] it means. The men have been taught to take salt tablets, but leaders don't see to this.
[01:09:21] Result heat exhaustion. The good leaders seem to get killed. The poor leaders get the men killed.
[01:09:29] The big problem is leadership and getting the shoulder straps on the right people.
[01:09:34] And then the book continues 60 millimeter mortars, mortar shells fell about 30 yards away
[01:09:41] and attacked a number of coconut trees. I lost interest in taking dictation and the Colonel
[01:09:46] stopped talking. When the salvo was over and things were quiet again, Brian Moore said,
[01:09:51] where was I? You saw that patrol. I tell you this, not one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this
[01:09:57] jungle. If you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit the combat zone,
[01:10:03] you have found out something. Now what's interesting about that is first of all,
[01:10:12] one man in 50 can lead a patrol in this jungle. That's a significant statement.
[01:10:19] And I will tell you, he says, if you can find out who the good patrol leaders are before you hit
[01:10:23] the combat zone, you found out something. How do you do that? You do that by putting them in
[01:10:26] these pressure situations. We had such a benefit. Our guys were so ready. We put these
[01:10:31] guy. We put, I put my, I put the seals going on deployment through training like that where you
[01:10:36] could see them break. You could see them not be able to handle it or what's more important.
[01:10:42] They wouldn't be able to handle it day one, day two. They'd be a little better, day three. They'd
[01:10:47] be a little bit better, day four. They'd be a little bit better. By the end of a six month workup,
[01:10:52] they're actually one of the people that can make these make these things happen.
[01:10:56] So it's not just about finding the good patrol leaders. It's about training them.
[01:11:05] He says, I have to get rid of about 25 officers because they just, I've had to get rid of about
[01:11:10] 25 officers because they just weren't leaders. I had to make the batiding commander weed out the
[01:11:15] poor leaders. This process continues other junior leaders are finding out that they must no more
[01:11:19] than they're men, more about their men. The good leaders know their men. Of everything he talks
[01:11:27] about, he says, the thing that he gives that you must know your men. That's the thing that that's
[01:11:32] that's the one that he doesn't say. They need a navigation. They need to work on your fire. He said,
[01:11:36] they need to know their men. Very interesting thing to focus on for for this guy talking,
[01:11:43] for general more talking about this or Colonel Moore. But I will tell you that
[01:11:53] having to get rid of about 25 officers, I'm going to go ahead out on a limb here. And I don't know
[01:11:59] how many officers he went through. But some of those officers could have been trained.
[01:12:05] Could have been trained. Could have been prepared. Could have been molded. Could have been
[01:12:07] and could have been educated. Could have been tested. Prior to going to combat, he probably would have
[01:12:12] done better than having to get rid of 25 of them. Continuing on, what then are the characters?
[01:12:22] What then are the distinguishing qualities of a leader? There are many essential characteristics
[01:12:28] that he must possess. But I will mention a few that come to mind as perhaps the most important.
[01:12:33] First, he must know his job without necessarily being a specialist in any in every phase of it.
[01:12:38] A few years ago, he suggested that all engineers, all engineering subjects, be eliminated
[01:12:43] from the required studies at West Point. I objected. For example, bridge building is especially for
[01:12:48] engineers. Yet, I think every senior officer should have some idea of what is involved.
[01:12:53] When we reached the Rhine in World War II, it was not necessary that I know how to build a bridge.
[01:12:58] But it was very helpful that I knew what was involved so that I could see the bridge engineers
[01:13:04] received proper support, in tonnage, allowed, and an idea of the time involved.
[01:13:09] So first, know your job. You have to know everything about it. I didn't know the sniper weapons
[01:13:14] this good. This sniper's did. I didn't know the radio. This is good. This is the radio man did.
[01:13:19] I didn't know the route. This is the point man did. But I knew enough about him. Continuing on,
[01:13:26] specialty is dominated almost every problem faced by the military today.
[01:13:31] By the, but face today by the military leader or the business manager. This individual must
[01:13:36] get deeply enough into his problem that he can understand it and intelligently manage it.
[01:13:40] Without going so far as to become a specialist himself in every phase of the problem,
[01:13:45] you don't have to be a tank expert in order to effectively use a tank unit of your command.
[01:13:51] Thomas J. Watson of IBM once said that the genius of an executive is the ability to deal
[01:13:59] successfully with matters he does not understand. This leads to another principle of leadership,
[01:14:05] which I have often found neglected both in the military and in business. While you need to be a
[01:14:09] specialist in all phases of your job, you should have a proportionate degree of interest in
[01:14:14] every aspect of it and those concerned your subordinates should be aware of your interest. So you,
[01:14:22] you should be interested in what is happening. You must get around and show interest in what
[01:14:27] your subordinates are doing even if you don't know much about the technique of their work.
[01:14:33] And you make these when you are making these visits try to pass out praise when do as well as
[01:14:39] corrections or criticism. That's an interesting one. It's very interesting. What Omar Bradley points
[01:14:46] out here that, hey, not only should you know what's happening but you should show interest in
[01:14:51] what your subordinates do. You know how I would translate that. I would call it building relationships.
[01:14:56] It's a little degree of relationship. That's what he's talking about. He's talking about building
[01:15:00] relationships showing interest being out there. Building relationships with your troops.
[01:15:05] Again, I think a lot of times in this speech, he's either brushing up or he's using his own
[01:15:12] verbiage to cover to talk about the same things that we talk about all the time. The same things
[01:15:21] that I write about all the time. Continue on, we tend to speak up only when things go wrong.
[01:15:29] This is such a well-recognized fact that a complaint department isn't in an essential part of many
[01:15:34] business firms. To my knowledge, no comparable facility exists anywhere to expedite the handling of
[01:15:40] praise for a job well done. It need not be extravagant. We all get enough criticism and we learn
[01:15:47] to take it. Even Sir Winston Churchill, despite his matchless accomplishment, found occasion to say,
[01:15:53] I have benefited enormously from criticism and at no point did I suffer from any perceptible lack
[01:16:00] thereof. But let us remember that praise also has a role to play. Napoleon was probably the finest
[01:16:07] exponent of this principle of recognition through his use of a quarter inch of ribbon to improve
[01:16:11] the morale and get results. So interesting that Bradley is very focused on praise.
[01:16:21] Very interesting that he's focused on praise. You can see what kind of a different guy is
[01:16:25] than Pat. And by the way, I forgot to say this. His book, Much of the movie patent, the famous
[01:16:32] movie Oscar award winning movie patent. It was a lot of it was based on on that book that he wrote,
[01:16:42] a soldier story. It's clean because there's two different philosophies right with the praise thing.
[01:16:48] Yeah, you know, you just get the feeling that Omar Bradley was a little bit a lot more.
[01:16:57] A lot more humble, a lot more open and probably hey, good job buddy. Where you don't expect
[01:17:04] Pat and to say hey, good job buddy. Unless it's some crazy situation. I told the job soldier.
[01:17:09] Right. But you picture Omar Bradley going, hey, nice work on that. That was good. You don't really
[01:17:13] saw him just saying it's an interesting thing for him to keen and on. It feels like there's
[01:17:20] I mean, maybe it goes with different personalities or whatever, but okay, so on one hand you have
[01:17:25] the guy who's always saying good job. One's good job. Different corrections when that's
[01:17:29] right. I can't make it out of both. So they're essentially it's almost like you're constantly
[01:17:35] in touch with how they're feeling about you kind of thing as a worker or as whatever. So it's
[01:17:41] like, it'll be like good job. Every little thing is either a good job or hey, you could do this
[01:17:46] a little bit better. Every single little thing. Right. So it's like you kind of know where you
[01:17:50] stand and it's kind of comforting, I guess in that way. But at the same time, it's kind of like
[01:17:55] Wendy, you know when you really did a good job. You don't really know as much you're not
[01:17:59] telling touch, but the opposite, the other guy who doesn't say anything, you do a little good job.
[01:18:03] You won't hear nothing ever. You'll know about the corrections for sure, but they tend and I'm
[01:18:10] speaking from experience more than anything. They tend to be like big corrections if you have to
[01:18:14] make it, you know, because it's no, if it's no factor corrections or it's like, you know, whatever,
[01:18:19] like, fine, it's a 80% solution and it's cool, whatever. Meanwhile, they don't say much as what I'm
[01:18:25] saying until something's a big deal good or bad. So really it kind of makes you want to strive
[01:18:31] to get that big compliment, you know, more so than. So it's less comforting, I guess, day to
[01:18:36] day, but at the same time, it's almost like this intangible motivation to do a good job for this guy,
[01:18:42] you know, you're kind of seems like that. Yeah, it's a dichotomy that's got to be balanced.
[01:18:48] You don't want to go overboard, you don't want to be compiling every little thing, you know,
[01:18:51] apart from every little thing either. I would say you are correct. It's better to back off a
[01:18:57] little bit and have your, have your compliments or your criticisms be worthy of either one of those things.
[01:19:07] Smaller corrections more often are easier to give than big corrections when people aren't used to
[01:19:14] see kind of conditions someone, right? You can condition someone and it's good to do this. If
[01:19:19] if I condition someone where they expect like, hey, some some pretty straightforward feedback,
[01:19:25] that's a totally positive thing. If you're not conditioned to it and all of a sudden I hammer you
[01:19:30] with something, it's a blow, you know, it hurts and it might even make you defensive. But if I'm
[01:19:37] constantly not constantly to the point of being annoying, but if I'm on a regular basis, I'm telling
[01:19:42] you, oh, echo, you know, can you adjust this thing when you when you put these things out or hey,
[01:19:46] echo, when you when you get when you get when you get done with the project, the report needs to have
[01:19:52] more detail in it. Okay. Well, the more I correct you and again, I got to be careful,
[01:19:59] can't go overboard, but I got to get your condition to where you understand that I am going to
[01:20:04] give you some some feedback, some negative feedback about what you're doing. Don't want to
[01:20:11] harp on you. It's really hard to tell, right? Because a lot of times people just sit there and take
[01:20:15] it and they go and kick their dog because they're mad at their boss. All right. The next little
[01:20:27] characteristic of a leader he says, both mental and physical energy are essential to successful
[01:20:32] leadership. How many really good leaders have you known who are lazy or weak or who couldn't stand the
[01:20:38] strain? Sherman was a good example of a leader without standing mental and physical energy. I cite
[01:20:44] him with some trepidation because some of you may be from Georgia. However, during the advance from
[01:20:51] Chad and Nuga to Atlanta, he often went for days with only two hours of sleep per night and was
[01:20:59] constantly in the saddle, doing reconnaissance and he often knew the dispositions and terrain so well
[01:21:05] that he could maneuver the enemy out of position without a serious fight with minimal losses. So general
[01:21:11] to come to Sherman, who marched to the sea, $100 million worth of damage in Georgia as he kind of
[01:21:20] destroyed things as he went. But showing that he had this high level of energy continues conversely,
[01:21:28] a sick commander is a limited value. It is not fair to the troops under him to have a leader who is
[01:21:34] not functioning 100%. I had to relieve several senior commanders during World War II because of illness.
[01:21:39] It's often pointed out that Napoleon didn't lose a major battle until Waterloo where he was a sick man.
[01:21:49] A leadership possessed human understanding and consideration for others. Men are not robots and should
[01:21:55] not be treated as though they were machines. I do not by any means suggest coddling. There's another
[01:22:01] example of the dichotomy, right? Don't treat him as if machines, but don't coddle him. But
[01:22:05] men are highly intelligent, complicated beings who will respond favorably to human understanding and
[01:22:10] consideration. By this means their leader will get maximum effort from each of them. You will also
[01:22:17] get loyalty. And in this connection it will it is well to remember that loyalty goes down as well as
[01:22:24] up the sincere leader will go to bat for his subordinates when such action is needed.
[01:22:30] Pretty straightforward dichotomy right there. A good leader must sometimes be stubborn.
[01:22:40] Here I am reminded of the West Point cadet prayer and part of that prayer says, I leader must be
[01:22:45] able to choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong. Armed with the courage of his convictions,
[01:22:51] he must fight to defend them. Then he has to come to a decision after thorough analysis.
[01:22:58] And when he is sure he is right, he must stick to it even to the point of stubbornness. Grant
[01:23:04] furnaces a good illustration of this trait. He never knew when he was supposed to be left.
[01:23:10] A less stubborn man might have lost at Shiloh. By the way, Shiloh 24,000 dead in two days.
[01:23:19] Total nightmare. Maybe you've heard a story of General Grant and Richmond campaign when,
[01:23:24] after being up all night making his reconnaissance and formulating and issuing orders,
[01:23:28] he laid down a fell asleep under tree. Sometime later a career wrote up and informed General
[01:23:33] informed the general that disaster and he is right flank. And that is troops.
[01:23:38] At the end of the line, we're in full retreat. General Grant sat up. Shiloh
[01:23:41] his head declared the cobwebs and said, it can't be so and went back to sleep.
[01:23:45] And it wasn't so. He had confidence in himself and in his subordinate leaders.
[01:23:50] A little hard for me to accept that one. I may give a little bit more attention if someone
[01:23:55] comes and tells me of my flank is collapsing. But the point being he had confidence, hey,
[01:24:02] we're going to be all right. Yeah. Yeah. That seemed like a little tail. I mean, I don't know.
[01:24:08] Obviously, I don't know if that's true or not. I'm assuming it's true, but it seemed like more of an
[01:24:12] exaggerated tail. Like straight up sleepy. Yeah. Straight up. There's a picture of Dave Birkin. I
[01:24:19] good deal to. Yes. Where I think we're putting in combat outpost, Falcon, and downtown
[01:24:25] Ramadi. Yeah. And the picture is probably, I don't even know when the picture's taken,
[01:24:30] but we're both asleep. We're both of us sitting up against a wall we're both asleep. We
[01:24:34] privately asleep awake for 24 hours at this point. He's the commander of salt. 16. Yes, salt six.
[01:24:42] He's he was a lightning one six. And I was the commander of task unit, bruiser. And we're both just
[01:24:49] racked out. Yeah. We're in the go. But what in the combat outpost, the combat outposts was now secure.
[01:24:55] There's a bunch of guys from the 137 army just surrounding this thing and building it out.
[01:25:02] And we get some sleep. So apparently we did. Yeah. Sleeping gets a bad rap, I guess.
[01:25:08] Now that you kind of mention it, you know, how sleeping on the job. Sleeping on a job. That's not a
[01:25:14] good expression. Like that expression is not a positive expression. Yes. You know, like hey, if you're
[01:25:18] sleeping on the job, you're not doing a good job. Yeah. But if you, yeah, actually,
[01:25:24] Dave talks about the story. Like as soon as he would get into an Overwatch position and get it set up
[01:25:28] and get security set, he'd be like, cool. I'm going to say, come here. The planning cycle for
[01:25:34] like us officers going into the field. We would be planning basically the whole time. We're
[01:25:39] ready to go in. We would know that once we got in the field, we could get some sleep. Yeah.
[01:25:43] Because there's no chain of command breathing down your neck for another conops.
[01:25:48] Submission. You're just out there. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Free. But if you're asleep to
[01:25:54] private, well, a lot of times, you're not, you know, good to know. But yeah, I do know what. I'm not
[01:25:59] 100% on board with that. I'm just being straight up. Like there's, I mean, I read some things
[01:26:05] that say, you know, if you, if you've missed, if you haven't slept for 24 hours, it's the equivalent
[01:26:10] of three, you're, you're legally drunk. I don't think so. Yeah. I don't think so. There's times,
[01:26:19] I'll tell you what's a good example. The early musters that we did when we were doing the musters,
[01:26:23] we were, we didn't, we didn't have a system down yet. And so we didn't know all the things that
[01:26:29] we're going to have to tackle. We were just, we just didn't prepare correctly. And so we,
[01:26:34] late for night would be up all night long. I think the worst muster as far as sleep goes was New York City.
[01:26:43] New York City, one of the nights, I think it was the first night. We had to sign whatever,
[01:26:49] 900 graduations certificates. It was 130 in the morning when we got started. P.T. by the way,
[01:26:56] for us, starts at three. So we sat there, we signed them, we went to bed for now, we woke up.
[01:27:03] And next day, we're on stage the entire day. No stopping people,
[01:27:07] really questions at me. Oh, what about this? What about that? I'm crap, crap, crap, crap,
[01:27:11] now could I have done that if I was seven drinks drunk? Some people can. Well, and I guess,
[01:27:19] well, let me, let me rephrase that. Let's not compare it alcohol. Because we know function that you
[01:27:23] could pull it off. But to say that I was up there cognitively impaired. Right. I don't think it's,
[01:27:32] I don't think you could say that. Yeah. I don't think it's true. Yeah, I think the reality of it is that
[01:27:37] different people are different and it's going to affect people in different ways and generally speaking,
[01:27:42] you know, getting free adequate risk is better than not getting at the end of the day. There's no doubt.
[01:27:46] Generally we'll take it. We would love to get that big old sleep. Sure. That's great. But what I'm
[01:27:51] saying is people don't always get to sleep a lot and you still have to make critical decisions
[01:27:56] and you're mind just like your body can adapt to certain situations. When I'm doing something,
[01:28:05] I just met out of time. I don't know what's happening. I'm on my mind.
[01:28:09] Right. Yeah. So, you know, it's interesting. The, okay. So there is, I'm not going to, I don't know the
[01:28:15] studies, but if you believe that you got enough sleep, it affects your capacity. So like,
[01:28:24] that almost suggests like, man, if you're just like, I'm going to beat you up through this
[01:28:28] hundred percent. Oh, yeah. And that's your attitude. That will help your cognitive capacity. Even if
[01:28:33] you didn't get that much sleep. And I think I've met more than anything where it's like,
[01:28:38] I don't mean you're no good to know about it when you're, you know, it's sleep-deprived. I'm saying
[01:28:43] it's a good attitude to have to make sure like your team or whatever isn't sleep-deprived. That's a
[01:28:49] good attitude to have, you know, but as an individual or team member, whatever, it's good to be able
[01:28:55] to function with it. It's been sleeping without. For sure. Yes. You do need to be able to sleep
[01:29:02] as preferred, but what I'm saying is it's not going to, you can step up and rise to the occasion.
[01:29:10] Look, I don't recommend it for sure. You want to be able to sleep. Yes. But I'm not
[01:29:17] drastically cognitively impaired at the moment, you know, where all of a sudden, wait a second,
[01:29:23] you know, I don't know what they answered that question is, hold on, you know, that doesn't happen.
[01:29:28] It doesn't happen. You're adrenaline flows, you're up there, you're, you pull the trigger on
[01:29:34] your gun, whatever. Things are happening, you get in the game, you get in the game, you know,
[01:29:40] you know, falling apart. No, you're making things happen. Even, you come to the mustard that
[01:29:49] you operate on very little sleep at the mustard, especially the early ones. Yeah. I see you,
[01:29:54] you know, hey, I forgot to press record. Well, you know what I'm saying? Maybe haven't been
[01:30:01] paying attention as much as you could of that case. Check. All right, continuing on, I do not mean
[01:30:08] to infer that there is always just one solution to a problem. Usually, there is one best solution,
[01:30:13] but any good plan, bowl the executed is better than indecision. There is more, there's usually
[01:30:19] more than one way to obtain results. And the most important thing about that little section right
[01:30:23] here, look, we know that's the same thing Pat and says, any good plan, bowl the execution is
[01:30:28] better than indecision or a good bowl is Pat and say a good plan executed now is better than a
[01:30:33] great plan executed next week. Saying the same thing, there's usually more than one way to obtain
[01:30:39] results. I like that. I want to focus on that because again, I'm not arguing with you about
[01:30:46] six and one half dozen the other. I'm not arguing with you about chewy-bring six vehicles or five
[01:30:51] vehicles. I'm not arguing with you if we should invest, you know, $800,000 in this market or
[01:30:59] $740,000 in this market. I'm not arguing with those things. What's the outcome going to be?
[01:31:05] They're going to be pretty close. There's more than one way to get a cat. Cool, let's go. Let's
[01:31:08] rock and roll. And by the way, when you come up with a plan and I go, you know what echo,
[01:31:15] let's do it. Let's do what you say. And we start going down that road. It's not like we're stuck there. And I go,
[01:31:22] hey echo, it looks like your plan might not be working out that great. Let's make an adjustment. You go,
[01:31:25] cool. Sounds good. And by the way, you're more open to hearing my suggestions if I was originally
[01:31:31] open to your suggestions in the first place. I built a relationship there. We're going to multiple fronts.
[01:31:40] Continuing on, another quality of leadership that comes to mind is self-confidence. You must have
[01:31:44] confidence in yourself. You're unit and your subordinate commanders and in your plan. This
[01:31:51] recalls a couple of incidents just before the invasion of Normandy, 1944. Story went around
[01:31:56] in some of the units that were making the assault on the beaches that they would suffer 100
[01:32:00] percent casualties that none of them would come back. I found a necessary to visit these units
[01:32:05] and talk to all ranks. I told them that of course we would suffer casualties, but certainly our
[01:32:10] losses would be less would not be 100 percent. And that with our air and naval support, we would succeed.
[01:32:17] After our landing, a correspondent told me that on his way across the channel in one of the leading
[01:32:22] LSTs, he had a notice they sergeant reading a novel struck by this seeming lack of concern
[01:32:28] by the sergeant. He said, he asked aren't you worried? How can you be reading a time like this?
[01:32:32] The sergeant replied, no, I'm not worried. General Bradley said everything would go all right.
[01:32:37] So why should I worry? I can't recall just what I had said, but it accomplished its purpose,
[01:32:45] at least where one man was concerned. I might relate another incident where there was a lack
[01:32:50] of confidence. I had to relieve a senior commander because I learned that his men had lost confidence
[01:32:55] in him. This meant of course that we would not expect maximum performance by that division.
[01:33:01] After being relieved, the officer came back through my headquarters and showed me a file of
[01:33:06] statements given to him by request. I am sure by the burgo master of all the towns his
[01:33:11] division had passed through. If he had confidence in himself, he would not have felt the need
[01:33:18] for all those letters. That's a cool little story. So he fires this division commander and the
[01:33:22] division commander comes out and says, listen, I haven't been doing a bad job. Here's the mayors
[01:33:27] of all the cities that we've been through. Here's they told me I did a good job. Here, look at
[01:33:31] the letters. And he's like, and he actually goes on. After seeing the letters, I told the officer
[01:33:35] that if I ever had any doubts as to whether to relieve him, those doubts were now removed. His
[01:33:41] letters proved beyond question that he had lost confidence in himself. So it was no wonder
[01:33:46] that the man had lost confidence in him. So definitely confidence is important. The interesting
[01:33:56] thing is humility, which is chapter two in extreme ownership, Czechyrigo, became an army value in
[01:34:10] 2019, which is awesome. But I also, he talks about confidence. That's what he talks about. He
[01:34:21] never league explorers. What happens when you get overconfident, right? And we all know that you
[01:34:25] can get overconfident and you can lose. So that's why humility is important. He says here,
[01:34:33] next characteristic, a leader must possess imagination, whether it be an administrative decision
[01:34:39] or one-made in combat. The possible results of that decision must be plain to the one making it.
[01:34:45] What will the next step be and the one after that? That's all he gives to imagination. That's
[01:34:51] all he gives to creativity. Need a little bit more. While there are many other qualities which can
[01:34:56] contribute to effective leadership, I will mention just one more, but it is a very important one
[01:35:00] character. This word has many meanings. I am applying it in a broad sense to describe a person who
[01:35:08] has high ideals who stands by them and who can be absolutely trusted. Such a person will be respected
[01:35:16] by all those with whom he is associated. And such a person will readily be recognized by his associates
[01:35:22] for what he is. Circumstances mold our character. These circumstances affect different people in
[01:35:31] different ways. From exactly the same set of circumstances, one man may theoretically build a palace,
[01:35:39] while another may have difficulty building a lean to. A lean to. It's a little hot.
[01:35:49] Little meat, the roof leans up against a stick. Put some, put some leaves on top of it to keep you dry.
[01:35:58] That's called a lean to. So from the same experiences, one person builds a palace, the other
[01:36:05] person builds a lean to. That's a rough one to take. It's a rough one to take because you might look
[01:36:11] around and say, well, you know, I know of the right circumstances in my life to be successful.
[01:36:18] I promise you that there's someone with worse circumstances, that's more successful than you. Promise
[01:36:24] you promise you. I believe this. It has been said that a man's character is the reality of
[01:36:37] himself. I don't think a man's strength of character ever changes. I remember a long time ago
[01:36:41] when somebody told me that a mountain's mountain might be reported to have moved. I could believe it
[01:36:47] or disbelieve it as I wished. But if anyone told me that a man had changed his character,
[01:36:52] I should not believe it. I don't know. Look, I think it's hard for people's characters to change.
[01:37:02] I don't think you can change someone's character very easily, actively, proactively make their
[01:37:07] character change. But I think that through life and through experience, people's character does
[01:37:12] absolutely change. And you can meet someone now that you knew 10 years ago and you'd say, whoa,
[01:37:19] that person's a whole new character and you would mean character. And it's classic sense.
[01:37:25] Yeah, I mean, what is character do you think? What just kind of moral, like your fiber,
[01:37:35] you know, it's not because it's not like you can talk to pretty much anyone and they'd probably tell
[01:37:40] you, yeah, like I'm a different person than I was 15 years ago. Pretty much everyone would be like,
[01:37:44] okay, that wouldn't be a big surprise or whatever, but they're not talking about that, right?
[01:37:48] Like, character is different. Well, they are talking about that. What he's saying is that,
[01:37:53] you know, that slimy guy that you knew in high school that was trying to screw people over and
[01:37:58] whatever, he's saying like, that guy when you meet him 20 years later, guess what he's doing,
[01:38:02] still a slimy guy. One's doing another thing. I disagree with that. I actually have known
[01:38:08] people whose character has changed. And for me, I mean, there's a, we could do a whole show, I guess
[01:38:15] about what is character, but like for me, character is doing what you're, you know, you're supposed to
[01:38:19] do. Like actually doing what you know you're supposed to do, doing what you know is the right thing to
[01:38:24] do. Yeah. That's, that's how you end up with character, right? You say you're going to do something
[01:38:29] you do it. You know you're supposed to do behave a certain way regardless of anyone's watching,
[01:38:33] regardless of the outcome. You know you're supposed to do the right thing you do at that's character.
[01:38:38] Yeah. I agree with you. I think that you can, it's a rare thing. I do kind of agree with him.
[01:38:46] Is it rare thing? It's a rare thing. There's something to be good. I remember that greasy dude,
[01:38:52] just being all trying to, you know, get won, take care of himself. Right. And you look at that
[01:38:57] person 10 years later. It's the same dude. But occasionally, you know, it's someone that changes.
[01:39:02] Yeah, like through maybe some big impactful event or maybe even just like a new
[01:39:08] influence in life and like a little revelation kind of thing like, but you can, yeah, yeah, that
[01:39:13] can happen. I think, and I think it kind of does happen on these teeny tiny ways, but nothing that would
[01:39:18] kind of collectively be considered character, you know, but I think yeah, I think why have people
[01:39:24] can? Yeah, I absolutely think they can. I think it, yeah, and I've seen it. I've seen it. I know
[01:39:32] people where I, you know, used to look at him and go, you, and now I look at him totally solid. Yeah.
[01:39:38] I mean, I don't know how much my character's changed, but I've had absolutely, I had it
[01:39:43] has changed. I'm a different guy than I was when I was 22. Yeah, maybe in the, in the, on the
[01:39:51] battlefield, maybe it's more rare, you know, like to the point where he's writing straight up,
[01:39:56] it can't be changed. Yeah, it's, it's strange that he's so, I mean, saying it's more believe that
[01:40:05] a mountain move than someone's character move. That's a really both thing. And look, I got plenty
[01:40:10] of examples where I know someone when they were, you know, 15 and then 20 and then 25 and 30 and it's
[01:40:17] the same guy, the whole time. Sometimes it's a person's just as upstanding in their character,
[01:40:24] the whole time. And sometimes it's, they go, or sometimes they're just a scumbag from day one
[01:40:30] and you're like, yeah, no, that's didn't expect much less than that. And then there's some people
[01:40:35] that progress. And there's some people that that regress, right? Some people get treated bad,
[01:40:41] they go through and their character goes down. Yeah. So I think we're in mutual disagreement with
[01:40:47] general Omar Bradley on this point. I think people's character can absolutely improve. And I think
[01:40:53] I think it can get worse as well. You know, somebody gets, what's that burned? Yeah. Right,
[01:41:00] you get burned by someone. You get burned by a girl. You get burned by one of your friends.
[01:41:06] That'll change your character. Yeah. Kind of the same deal, right? Some big, like, revelation,
[01:41:11] you know, or some big impactful event, or the wrong influence over time. Like,
[01:41:16] just over time and time, I'm telling you know, you start hanging around with wrong people,
[01:41:20] getting to drugs or something like this, you know, or it's kind of like, man, my whole life is like,
[01:41:25] if you don't lie and cheat and steal, you kind of don't live, you know, you kind of don't survive,
[01:41:29] kind of in this environment or something like that. Yeah, that one makes sense, do you? Yeah.
[01:41:36] Check all, he's wrapped that's the last characterist that he talks about. All leaders must
[01:41:42] possess these qualities which I have been discussing. And the great leaders are those who
[01:41:47] protect possess one or more of them to an outstanding degree. Some leaders just miss being great
[01:41:53] because they are weak in one or more of these areas. There's still another ingredient in this
[01:41:58] formula for a great leader that I have left out. And that is luck. All caps. He must have
[01:42:07] opportunity. Then of course, when opportunity knocks, he must be able to rise and open the door.
[01:42:12] Cool. I mean, look, yes, absolutely. I've been extremely lucky. I've seen people be extremely
[01:42:22] lucky. I've seen people being unlucky. So luck absolutely plays a role. I will say you make your own
[01:42:29] luck to an extent. Luck is a tough one. No one wants to, it's it's it's but it's a double
[01:42:42] edge sword, right? It's a double edge sword because you either, oh, that guy got lucky. Right.
[01:42:48] You didn't see how hard that guy works. Right. Or that guy got unlucky. You didn't see what
[01:42:54] that person did to end up in that unlucky spot. And both those things can flip. And they're both
[01:43:00] true. Yeah. So yeah, man. Yeah, it gets real complicated and luck thing. Yeah. I mean, I talk about
[01:43:09] in leadership strategy. So I talk about the the luck that I had in the seal things. All kinds of
[01:43:14] luck. Yeah. All kinds of luck for sure. Just the people I work with the deployments that I did,
[01:43:20] the situations that I was in. There's a lot of luck there. Some of that luck I manufactured.
[01:43:26] Some of it was just straight up all caps. No. But then it's like at the same time, you can be like,
[01:43:35] well, even in a great result, like a scenario with a great result, you could have been even more
[01:43:40] lucky. They're possible. You know, so it's like especially when you want to point your finger,
[01:43:45] you know, and be like, then not point your finger. But when you want to put your finger on a certain
[01:43:50] result and be like, oh, this was lucky. Rather, it's just way more to it than that. Like,
[01:43:54] you can't, they're, they're better results that are that were possible. Yes. Right. So you just chose
[01:44:01] to point your finger at this very specific result and be like, this was lucky. And then, and then
[01:44:04] it's a spectrum. You could have been like one level less lucky and still had a great result,
[01:44:10] kind of thing. And then it goes down from there and it can go up from there too. So it's like,
[01:44:16] to any time to label it luck as the thing. I mean, their extreme scenarios for sure. Oh, yeah,
[01:44:22] like you win the lottery. That's lucky. Yeah. You know, they're technically in the lot itself.
[01:44:27] It does play a role. Yeah. It's not the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's not the whole deal at all. And
[01:44:32] it's just like, it's like, if you, you get a, let's say this luck is a factor, but it is a smaller factor
[01:44:42] than most people give it credit for. Though, like you said, there are times where people just get
[01:44:47] lucky. Oh, yeah. Massively lucky. And then you have to evaluate like what specific
[01:44:52] result are you talking about? Because if it's like, okay, this person has a 20 million dollars in
[01:44:57] is a bank in his bank account, that in and of itself is the result, right, of something, right?
[01:45:05] Now you can already evaluate, okay, was it hard work? And then with that hard work, it's like,
[01:45:10] okay, what luck is there luck in that hard work? Kind of thing? Or did they just win the lottery?
[01:45:14] Okay, that's a big lucky thing, kind of thing. But you're just talking about the 20 million
[01:45:18] dollars in the account. You're not talking about his whole life. You're not talking about any of that.
[01:45:22] You're just talking about a very specific scenario. So that's why I think sometimes people get
[01:45:26] jammed up. And they'll evaluate this whole big resulting scenario. Not a specific element in it,
[01:45:32] a big resulting scenario. All of this person's whatever, you know, successful in this way,
[01:45:38] right? And they're like, oh yeah, it's just, he just got lucky. But Brad, you're talking about
[01:45:44] that success has so many different elements in it. Good and bad, by the way. And then you just
[01:45:49] wrap up the whole thing and deliver a luck. Luckily, most likely a minor impact, but it is
[01:45:56] an impact and there are times when it's a significant impact. But yeah, it's like it's straight up or
[01:46:03] most of the time, and when you hear it, it's straight up migrating every other factor. Oh,
[01:46:07] people want to let people say, oh, that guy is lucky. For sure. For sure. When someone's trying to
[01:46:14] make excuses for themselves on why this person got this promotion and I didn't know they were lucky.
[01:46:21] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there no luck involved? No, there's some luck involved, but let's not leave it to luck.
[01:46:30] Continuing on, some may ask, why do you talk about the qualities of leadership?
[01:46:34] They maintain that you either have leadership or you don't, that leaders are born not made. I suppose
[01:46:40] some are born with a certain amount of leadership. Frequently, we see children who are
[01:46:45] who seem inclined to take charge and direct their playmates. The other youngsters follow these directions
[01:46:51] without protest, but I am convinced nevertheless that leadership can be developed and improved by
[01:46:57] study and training. 100%. There's no better way to develop leadership than to give the
[01:47:04] youngster or other individual a job involving responsibility and let them try to work it out.
[01:47:11] Try to avoid telling them how to do it. You talk about youngsters. As you heard, as I talk
[01:47:18] about leadership strategy and tactics, this is a technique that's a technique to make people
[01:47:24] better leaders, put them in leadership situations, give them responsibility, give them a job, give
[01:47:27] a task, something they can do, make them lead it, they lead it, their successful their confidence
[01:47:31] goes up. Then he says, try avoiding how to telling them how to do it. Yeah, that's decentralized command.
[01:47:37] That, for example, is the basis for a whole system of combat orders. Yes. Combat orders, they're
[01:47:45] talking about something very specific. It is a way of delivering orders using commanders in
[01:47:50] 10 as opposed to telling you, here's the mission. Here's the people, here's the weapons,
[01:47:54] here's everything. Here's exactly what I want you to do and said you just give them the mission.
[01:47:56] You let them figure it out. They call that combat orders. Well, tell the subordinate,
[01:48:02] we tell the subordinate commander what we want him to do and leave him to the details.
[01:48:08] I think this system is largely responsible for the many fine leaders in our services today.
[01:48:12] We are constantly training and developing younger officers and teaching them how to accept
[01:48:16] responsibility. However, don't discount experience. Someone may remind you that Napoleon
[01:48:22] led armies before he was 30 and Alexander the great died at the age of 33. Napoleon as he grew
[01:48:28] older, commanded even larger armies. Alexander might have been even greater, had he lived longer
[01:48:34] and had more experience. In this respect, I like, I especially like general buckner's theory,
[01:48:42] that judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgment.
[01:48:51] And he wraps it up here. I've been asked to speak on leadership in the past. I have fairly well-covered
[01:48:56] these same thoughts with other groups. Somehow, however, at the moment, these thoughts take on added
[01:49:04] significance for me. You see, my first great grandson was born a year ago. We call him FAT Henry.
[01:49:12] What happens to his life? Into the lives of his contemporaries may well be in your hands.
[01:49:19] Thank you. So, it's a poignant kind of way to wrap it up. The fact that the
[01:49:34] leaders right now that are listening to this, the leaders that are learning, the leaders that are
[01:49:40] reading, they will end up running the world. And they will end up running it well and making it
[01:49:48] better or running it bad than making it worse for FAT Henry. So, interesting, interesting. I'm sure
[01:50:04] we'll get to his book at some point, but so much about leadership. So many things, you know, that we hit
[01:50:15] we cover, we see it from a different angle, makes you better, makes me better. It makes me better every time
[01:50:22] I get to the opportunity to think through these things. And, of course, the best way to train leaders
[01:50:34] is to make sure that we are being good leaders ourselves. We're setting a good example.
[01:50:39] The best example that we can staying on the path, you might say. So, since we are looking to stay
[01:50:49] on the path, anything you recommend echo Charles for that conduct. Well, we do want to keep ourselves
[01:50:56] capable, improve the skills, increase the skills one skill being, due to it's important skill.
[01:51:07] To increase and maintain our capability, due to it's one of them, keep working out,
[01:51:12] if you're not working out, work out. The weak body is an incapable body. In a matter of speaking.
[01:51:21] Kind of. That is true. You definitely want to be as strong as you can, different for everybody.
[01:51:26] Yes, realistic. Body. Be the best shape that you can be in. That's good advice.
[01:51:33] Can't really be denied. Can't be. So, when we're doing GJT, we need a G, we need a Rashcards,
[01:51:40] get an origin G, because they're the best 100% factually. So, in America. In America.
[01:51:48] You know, okay, we blown that off now. Made America's not a big deal anymore. Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:51:52] Or is made America bigger deal than ever. I think you've got an American supply chain.
[01:51:56] Yes, that what's going on? Oh, yeah. So, what? Right. Just making sure.
[01:51:59] We're seeing to me, like you were just getting ready to move on. Well, without saying made to make it.
[01:52:03] Okay, yeah, I understand your feedback. Thank you. Made America is a big deal. Huge deal.
[01:52:11] It was a big deal prior to the virus. Yep. Now it's an even bigger deal.
[01:52:17] American supply chain. We're not begging and pleading for stuff to get shipped overseas.
[01:52:22] We have it. It's made in America. All of it. Yes, sir. So. And by the way, it's not just GJT,
[01:52:29] you either. Gines. You probably need genes. Yes, sir. Oh, it is everyone in the world.
[01:52:35] The entire world where genes. Yes. Every single person in the entire world needs genes has genes.
[01:52:41] Why not get genes that are made in America? Why not get the best and most comfortable genes ever made?
[01:52:46] That's my question. Yeah, no reason why not. So, go to origin, main, the state main.
[01:52:54] Origin main.com is where you can get all this stuff. Okay. So all this stuff that I'm talking about like
[01:52:59] Jocquip. So, I look, when we put it is made in America. From the beginnings of the materials
[01:53:08] because one thing to be like, hey, yeah, I, you know, switch the tag out here up in, you know,
[01:53:15] one beach and so it's made here technically, you know, the end-hey look, known the matter. That's
[01:53:20] cool, but some people are mad. Well, some people are here serving you right. I wrong. All right.
[01:53:25] Stand corrected for sure, but on the fiber, the cotton is grown in America. That is made in America.
[01:53:32] So, these things are made in America. So, like we said, geese, fresh carts, genes, American denim,
[01:53:42] other things, joggers, sweat suits, various apparel clothing items, boots.
[01:53:47] So, origin boots have like a more of like a, I don't want to say mystique, but you know, when
[01:53:58] you're like, when you kind of see the origin boots, they kind of have a gravitas to them.
[01:54:03] Yeah. More so then there's a little something about them. Yeah. Uh, you know how,
[01:54:08] Omar Bradley said that some people don't have it. Yeah. But we could say that certain items in the
[01:54:14] world also have it. I would say that origin boots have it. That is the perfect way to put it. Yes.
[01:54:20] Yes, sir. So, get some boots with it. Yes. Also, jockel fuel. Okay. So, I was talking about
[01:54:27] staying healthy, staying capable, all this stuff like in the hey man supplementation is
[01:54:32] part of that, that whole deal. So, important. Very important. You won't know how important it is
[01:54:38] until you joint start giving up. You joint start quitting work out, you know, when your elbows are all sore,
[01:54:44] when you're trying to, you know, get under the bench and stuff. Yeah. Just getting to know good.
[01:54:49] Joint warfare, acrylic oil, super acrylic oil, discipline and discipline go. We got the ready to drink
[01:54:57] hot with you drinking lemon lime today. Yeah. You know, I had citrus psycho. Yeah. I had the
[01:55:02] tropical thunder one earlier. You're too deep, huh? Yes, sir. Check. Mulk, by the way, if you're a human
[01:55:13] and let's say you, you are doing any kind of activity, you need protein. Yes. Might as well get
[01:55:20] protein that is clean and that just straight up tastes like dessert. Yeah. Dave Burke. Good
[01:55:27] you'll do. Yeah. Worried that maybe it was a weakness. Yes. At night to have a strawberry mulk.
[01:55:34] Man, that was a very technical scenario. It was talking about. So, I can see it's a week, you know what?
[01:55:40] I evaluated it. It's like back into the whole thing where you used to be like, hey, jocco,
[01:55:45] if you're so into the way your supplements taste, maybe that's a weakness. Right. It's kind of the same
[01:55:52] thing. Yeah. The same thing. Concept. Yes. I thought I still think you're wrong. Well, at the end of the day,
[01:55:58] if you're results driven, oh, yeah, it's like weakness. No, I, you won't be able to recognize any
[01:56:03] weakness in the scenario. So let it go, because at the end of the day, you win 100% you're
[01:56:07] correct about that. Sure. But if we want to go tech, you're in tension is something. You see them
[01:56:16] same. Yeah. I want the discipline that you're doing. It's good. Yeah. Dave, look, this is a thing that we need
[01:56:22] to just continue trying to clarify for everyone. If you have a mulk late at night, you're not that
[01:56:30] hungry, but you want to taste something delicious. So you mix one up. It's 11 o'clock at night. Let's face it.
[01:56:38] That's a questionable activity. But at the same time, you're literally providing your, your body
[01:56:45] with the fuel that it needs to be strong. So it's, it's, it's a real thing. This is a real,
[01:56:51] this is a real win. So I'm calling it a win. Yes, sir. I agree. So yeah, get on that. Get on that.
[01:56:58] We need to do it. Do we do I need to make a mulk mulk that tastes like crap, right? Just for the
[01:57:05] mental discipline. Just to get a double dose of discipline, you'll get strong and you'll get
[01:57:11] mentally tougher because you'll be drinking something that tastes like caracene. Yeah. No, don't do that.
[01:57:16] Don't do that. Please check. So anyway, yes, mulk protein. And there's a form of a dessert all for it.
[01:57:22] 100%. Jocquawaited. Also, you want something a little bit lighter, organic refreshing if you drink it as
[01:57:30] iced tea. The thing that people really like about Jocquawaited is that it allows you to bet two dead

[01:59:08] It's like the cheesy thing where someone says it's a nice night for a walk.
[01:59:13] And the other person says, but it's cold in Nebraska. So it's a little, like I would say to you,
[01:59:18] it's a nice night for a walk. And you would say, but it's cold in Nebraska. Then I go, okay, cool.
[01:59:23] Hey, years, it's going on. You know what I thought it was? What? I thought it was nice night for a walk.
[01:59:30] A and the other person says nice night for a walk. Then you say, wash data,
[01:59:36] moral, nothing clean, right? Then the other person says nothing clean, right?
[01:59:43] What is that from? Terminator. Oh, okay. Anyway. So yes,
[01:59:47] both of feedies all day. If I see you, I'm going to give you the same deal. I may say,
[01:59:51] nice and far more. My knowledge comes from 20 years of serving the nation in the military.
[01:59:56] The knowledge comes from Terminator too. Well, that was Terminator one, but yes, Terminator too,

[02:00:18] we also have other podcasts. Wonderful. We're having some technical difficulties right now. We had
[02:00:23] a podcast that was previously called the thread. There's already an existing podcast called the thread,
[02:00:30] which I didn't know about because I just didn't really pay attention to it. And so we're changing
[02:00:35] the name of ours. Just don't know what it's going to be called yet. We'll put it up there shortly. So if you
[02:00:40] missing the thread, that's where it's at. It's gone for now. It'll be back. We'll put up all the
[02:00:44] episodes. We'll change whatever we're going to change so that it's differentiated from that. My my boss
[02:00:50] oops. Yeah. The weird thing is there's all kinds of podcasts called the thread or some variant of that.
[02:00:58] But ours, I think our our retailers was more popular. So they didn't like that. And I don't want
[02:01:06] people to be confused. No, it'll eliminate confusion for sure. We also have the grounded podcast,
