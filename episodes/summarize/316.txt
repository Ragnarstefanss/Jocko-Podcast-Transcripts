because and I had these with multiple of sexes like I don't know what it is about regimental commanders but they they just felt like they could talk to me like like I was a piece of shit and I just got to a place in my life in my career I just wouldn't be talked to like that and so it created this unhealthy tension and then when I would push back on some of these conversations you would think that after like a couple days it would actually be like a steam release but it almost like it almost was like seen as a threat and it would almost increase the pressure where then they would come back and want to like reassert dominance which would then want to cause me to like reassert like fuck you so but the regimental opso job just to pan picture going into the story we're about to tell I mean it was the Marseille job was awesome fulfilling manageable hours good work the regimental opso job was like 20 hour days we spent two months at an ITX which is in the Mojave Desert where it is just expected that like I don't eat I have tobacco and I just drink energy drinks like it's almost like I'm looked down upon if that's not how I conduct myself and it just it took a lot out of me and my boss was not very appreciative most of the time and I got into some like this was kind of at the point of my career where I started really pushing back so like as a as a first lieutenant as a exo and a body with my batani commander was kind of verbally and even at times physically abusive like just kind of took it and in my head was like this is wrong like we talk about china and the fact that they banned parts of the internet and social media they you are not allowed and here it is happening here in america all the enough what is the what do you think is like the above board not even above board what what is the motive you think and banning someone driving a narrative i feel i'm sorry man i feel like someone who's it response i mean i'm sure this is a group people who are responsible for that and they're kind of running the banning but what is it like what is the conclusion that they come to the be like you know what we should really just ban this is just driving a narrative they're driving a narrative and here there's there's what sucks is the worst thing you can do to try and drive a narrative is not let people talk because if someone has a dumb idea the best thing you could do is let them talk about their dumb idea so we can say hey here's your why your idea is dumb what's scariest when we let ego get involved and instead of me saying you know what echo's got a opinion i'm not sure if he's right or but like I feel like a taller organization would have been like hey we're gonna let investigation play out we're gonna let you sit and calm down obviously this is personal but you've broken some rules and what's left the investigation play out and we'll see where the chips fall like that's the reason but they they obviously fired me within like 12 hours were you surprised when you got relieved I was surprised I didn't learn investigation take place I really was it did not I didn't expect that like when I was calculating what would happen I thought I might be benched while on investigation took place and I had even talked to my battalion exo for like 20 minutes like I was texting my friends and I was like if the Marine Corps was really trying to find me like they didn't think to text me they didn't think to call me and so like potentially potentially the public affairs office arm just wasn't talking to like whoever should have been calling me and just got out ahead of it first and so then it came back to like what do I want to do like if if none of them care about me do I want to limp towards the retirement for the next three years because that's best case and I just came to the decision like no I can't live my life like that like this was never supposed to be a career this was always supposed to be something that was fulfilling I don't care about the money as much as other people might I really don't like I'll be fine no I'm gonna poke you in the chest because what you did was broke the rules and then I'm like well no come back and listen to what I'm saying like no you're still breaking the rules I'm gonna make it worse for you and so like each one of these is just an example of like if you think cared about me they would have called one thing that I noticed and I heard you talking about it you know at the end of that second video you're getting emotional and you're like asking for accountability and then kind of ranting against everything a little bit so when I was at SOS a captain the lieutenant Colonel was my battalion commander that he did a lot for me he retired as at O6 he had gotten on my social media and said if Stuart's other was honorable he would resign he didn't state that he was my previous boss or that he was like a mentor to me he didn't email me he didn't text me and I felt like I mean that really was like a stab in the back to me because a lot of general officers that are on LinkedIn that they gave preferred LinkedIn not Facebook so that's why I had a LinkedIn too a lot of the senior officers knew who he was and so for him to call me out like that and so I'm struggling with when I'm with my kid on the boat I'm struggling with they relieved me without even an investigation like I knew my job as it risk when I posted that video but like no one reads the follow up you know what I mean you get that one shot that's right especially when it comes to like a viable type videos that are gonna get out there no one's fault no one's following up with that you get home from that video and your life is like you didn't pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-re-re-re-re-wife now your life is just like no this isn't gonna happen that's right well it depends on what kind but uh butter there's a lot of butter in it butter sugar flavoring there's like a flavoring of some sort um like chocolate frosting this is butter sugar and chocolate and like cream I think that's pretty much it that's part of like there's a lot of fake part I don't like that's why cupcakes not really my thing bro I make exact opposite but like again I'm having all these indicators so this like this escalating thing of like me feeling like what I said is right all right you should show some sympathy and they're like but the the cold shower you know how they say one of the benefits is like it exercises your mind to do something you really don't want to do so that way like mentally everything else seems like I don't know easier or whatever um I guess even though you really don't that's not the first thing you want to do going a cold shower or cold tub when you wake up usually but when you get out you do feel like dang oh your entire career we'd been at war you know I spent more than half my career we weren't at war you know we were in the 90s the dry years but I'm thinking man this guy's been in the Marine Corps for 17 years the Marine Corps and America's been at war for that entire time you as you mentioned you said you know you got a lot to lose you know what could happen you knew you were risking your baton command you know family stability the whole nine yards you bring up that letter from the commandant that he wrote and you know you mentioned did anyone throw their rank on the table and say we shouldn't give a boggerman which again you know going back to the the silent five which is what McMaster called the the Joint Chiefs of Staff that work for LBJ and you can even hear you know that I've read in the beginning of guys that reflected back and said I should have said something I should have stood up you talk about the fact that the people that died dying in vain if we don't you you say you said if we don't own up and say we did not do this well in the end but like I said some like hard stuff to hear it wasn't very like it wasn't like a uniting message it was just like a fuck you to everyone and again I even put in the post I'm ready to go to jail yeah right on Stu you got any closing thoughts before you shut it down now I'll just echo to your audience as I watched my saga unfold in the media the mainstream media is so polarized right now it was very hard to get a true assessment of like how people even felt watching the news because you know most of the people were taking my statements and trying to fit them into whatever their narrative was and shows like yours podcasts like yours YouTube channels I was actually getting much more accurate feedback from what people thought than mainstream media and I felt the way to do that was through what I wanted to be just the one video like I did not plan it to be anything other than that I thought I'll make one video I'll explain some of the things that I think they should have done and I'm going to demand accountability because that's what I think we deserve because we're missing it and so that was what led to that first video and even after I made it like I I articulate in that first video that I knew I was potentially going to lose my job my retirement my family stability like obviously I had thought through that articulated it in the video and even after I made the video I didn't post it right away right so for all those reasons again I made more sense to plead guilty and that so that was kind of it almost anti-climactic a little bit you you I'll tell you though there was some drama and so like I said the fastest court martial from exit of jail and agreement in the history of the Marine Corps also one of those charges like 88 I think I was the first officer charge since Vietnam like they were just like throwing stuff on the wall and I'm like quickly answering him while trying to do all these different things and there was just like one situation where he snapped started screaming for an everyone and I looked at him and that was a situation like here time I'm going to move around for a while I didn't say anything I just walked out this is like I'm we're gonna fight so I walked out So as a batank manager I was always the first one in the office and it just so happened that that day my wife had a medical appointment and I had agreed to drop the kids off at like at school it's called a-to-clock and so it was like an abnormal occurrence so that's like the one day I didn't show up early and so I take the kids and so now I don't get into work until like 18 and as a batank manager you don't tell people when you're coming in you just show up at a normal time but I had texted my option accidentally I came around late and like you know you gotta understand like how scary it is to do something like that because I essentially said my career's over in Panera but I wanted North Carolina and so then he called me back and said this is what he said he said I got your email I'm gonna give you exactly what you want and I went to his house for dinner to his previous with our families to hang out and like when I was in that motel we're like you know I had no other like can scattered my life's falling apart like I could probably really could have used a friend alright it's anything we can talk about like why you doing this he then screenshot it those and brought them to the investigating officer unsolicited to say look I was trying to figure out what his motives are like he this stew sheller is just a fucking a ferries character she'd never been a batile in command you're like who does that like what man does that blood in the water there's blood in the water man sharks are going to pounce so I was like it looks so cool to see that last page posted because the way it's laid out and stuff um final spin check that out leadership strategy and tactics field man or

active retire their families go to our families check out mark least but they released the command investigation with all those like it's just crazy things that those officer said to the media with my medical investigation so that selective articles could be written about like how I was a violent extremist and it was just blatantly false stuff like I'm still on the fence of whether I should sue for libel or just like move forward but so once they leaked at that investigation your point the judge the judge was like if that's true like this is criminal like those people should be brought to the court not Lieutenant Colonel Scheller and so the Marine Corps was like forced to do another command investigation on the leaked command investigation so they did another command investigation so you end up going up trial and this trial the judge you said looked at your record and was like hey well where did this come from the judge I don't think one of me to plead guilty so it wasn't you know all those charges you read off and there's like all these findings of facts the only choice there's only one choice except guilty for all of them at special court martial or plead not guilty to all of them the general like so to give in the weeds about what any of them said it was almost irrelevant and so so if you did not not not guilty what would happen how to go to general court martial and so that's when I made that fourth video in my Charlie's like general McKenzie is like I can't think in military history where someone is so obviously culpable like it's just clear like the Emperor has no clothes you have to see it I mean I've got a couple stories where like I basically tried to throw my career away a couple times because I was like this is important to me like this is important to me and you know you can think about what you want and like I talked to some of my guys after he did it in front of everyone and go my guys were like I can't believe you didn't hit him like I can't believe you had the balls to just walk away like I wouldn't have done that so there were times I think from like 30 years ago what they have now is you know world's better and don't what we used to have like they have small groups they facilitate good discussions they really challenged my thinking on the wars I mean we went back it's like Frederick the Great and Prussia all the way through Napoleon and Civil War and modern day yeah album one this album you talk about it does have tracks on it each track is literally the solution for any moment of weakness you might have the common ones apparently I need to make one for cupcakes well because you got to have much by a cupcake but it was that was like it was like too fast for me to be like oh let me pop in trick and psychological warfare I don't even think I have my phone you got and so I tell you that just to say my CEO had stopped by my office and called like three times and my upso called me and was like hey sir, CEO was really looking for aish probably calm and so when I drove in I got in I think I like eight thirty that morning, CEO was actually walking because his buildings let's say a two minute walk from my building he was actually walking between the buildings and I saw him Like up to like my senior and list of like every single one like I was bringing in chaplains. but like you said it's only been like one week since close to Christmas they've been back so who knows what about your friends in the marine core what do they say nothing I mean the the the lieutenant kernels that were closest to me in the investigation that I've made I've counted a couple interviews and just illustrated what they said they've obviously gone calm silently all these other guys that I know have come online and been like that's bullshit that they did that I'm I constantly say to clients and people and friends we don't make good decisions or an or emotional like don't try it this started as a joke when I was a young and listed guy like we would go out drinking and make decisions you know and if the joke was hey don't make decisions don't make life changes I would volunteer for cartoons and do stuff like that oh so I totally did totally did I was doing something in the kitchen and there was like a container in the leftovers you know how people when you're younger you're like gonna go out with your friends drinking and you do like all we're gonna pre-game ever heard of that and I was like all right I was like I don't know if I can do a tonight I've just been fired why don't we you know give me the night and so went to bed I was the last night actually slept with my wife that night slept with my something the same bed with my wife got up the next morning I got the three boys in the couch so like maybe you should just chill and get some sleep and that was his way of saying like maybe he went too far like trying to offer me some sleep and of course I'm just stubborn I might know I don't need sleep I'm just fine and so you just gotta understand that like that's what I came out of after a year of just being overworked to like almost like fist fighting a couple times and then going into my batank of energy so you you're you're having clashes with regimental commander So at OCS, then I told him, I was like, I want to be an infantry officer, and they just were like, and very tri-off, so shell-eyed, you know, and what kind of like, why were they freaking out about that? it's already up like you can't can't put the lid back on the bottle and even if I could I don't know if I'd want to so this is me saying this in this moment I was like I really believe in what I said in that video like I feel very strongly about it so therefore i'm gonna ban him i should be like well echo's got an idea if that idea actually has merit we should bring it out in the open we should talk about it and see if it's right or wrong or maybe not necessarily right or wrong this is where it's this is what's scary not necessarily right or wrong everyone wants everything to be black or white science science isn't black and white science changes so when you say something is wrong what how many things are actually wrong not too many especially when you have evolving situations whether they're political situations medical situations these things evolve and so to just say you know what we're not gonna let you talk about your idea is really crazy and it's happening that's why we made the jocca on the ground jocca on the ground dot com it's a place that we control we don't control this platform that you're listening is too right now unless you're on the underground you know it's the same thing as it'd be us like I just the way you win the way you fight a counter or the way you fight in an insurgency is to not get involved in an insurgency and that requires deeper thought on the operational strategic levels and we've just celebrated these generals for the last 20 years that have wrote the small wars, manuals or reinvented the small wars, wars, manuals and counter-insurgency manuals and there's a time at place where we is military tacticians need to understand how to do it absolutely 100% agree, read all the books, got it but to just continue to engage them for multiple decades without like real metrics of effectiveness or exit strategies, Afghanistan withdrawals just the perfect example. so he was smiling as in his command photo we don't smile in command photos I knew I didn't like him when he when I saw that I know another one this one guy they use that in the court of law against you these are like I don't like people so I got gagged on what's called a Friday I went through a Saturday Sunday one to two Zones did there was to Friday so now it's going into the next weekend and that following week on the Tuesday Wednesday I knew that the Secretary of Defense the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and General McKenzie were going to be testifying to the House and the Senator and so I calculated if I violated the gag order they might have a disproportional response and that that would bring attention to the whole message that I was trying to illustrate so I made another post that was this one was probably my most insightful you know it had some like insightful language in terms of not like but like when everyone tells you it you do start to question like you know if everyone in this room is crazy like what does that make me either I'm the only sane one or maybe I am the crazy one so after the third video they actually offered me a deal illegal deal I could have just taken it now I've been that I went back to my house and was like pacing deciding whether or not to hit post because I knew as soon as I hit the button it was going to change the trajectory of my life but again I spent my whole adult life experiencing studying thinking living this and I just got to a place where I didn't think anyone else was going to say it I felt the need to say it videos about I think it's about four and a half minutes long something like that you're in your canmies so that's something yeah you got to understand I mean in that second video like that emotion wasn't fake like I knew I was given up everything like I so you had an investigation that was about me that you leaked through the improper channels you were scolded by the judge you created a new investigation still about me about your improper handling and the only way for me to get that is to go through the problem the proper freedom of information act like that's correct and I was like ah you know this is like have you done that? Like, you know, to mean Lieutenant the major, like you don't talk to me like that. And so for, you know, it's similar to Ramani, where like I went to Sua, we've been in Ramani for six years and also, and I'm using baby wipes and we have no infrastructure and it's like, it's like we've never been there before. It's like the captain to major PME, said so you don't have to go to the resident, but you have to do the school, so there's like box of books where you can get sent the books and get credit for it that way, there's seminars where you can go to like night school for it, so every captain has to go through it to become a major, but they select the top ones to go to the resident one your course. I got selected in like October so I don't even have Marseille for like three months so like within three months to take in the job I was looking for the next job It was like right after the delibia thing and the Benghazi thing and like the, and because of that thing, the mu deployments had gotten like backed up. and you know I I've never my wife and I never like slept in separate rooms even when we were angry like early my marriage I was like I'm never you never making me sleep on the couch And I was like one of the few times where like, you know, I'm still young and the curtain had been peeled back, but I remember thinking like, I get it. Anxiety to me, think of it like you're about to do public speaking and everyone has butterflies but like a severe case of anxiety is almost like debilitating, right? and I know what he did then because the monitor has two responsibilities he's got a responsibility to the Marine Corps he's got a responsibility to use person and the monitor's job responsibility to Marine Corps is to keep competitive officers competitive so then he went he didn't know me from Adam so after that he went through my record and as he was going through my record he probably came to the realization like shit this guy's pretty good if I bury him in a staff job in secondary division then I end his career so this is a good example right you take a step back and say okay where am I going to be strategically and this is another thing I thought about the time is taking a step back and saying okay where does it how does this play out strategic from a strategic perspective where am I going to end up just just things to think about which you're clearly like hey here's some wording I could have changed here's a thing that would have helped out my relationship so there's always things that if you can try and take a step back they're going to be beneficial to you almost guaranteed the risk to that is time the risk to that is time also the risk to that is you can rationalize to not do anything and he talks to him and they say that you said that you're going to jail like anything like online chat rooms like any email if you communicate this was because they offered you a deal So I wrote 65 pages like I just couldn't stop writing and I gave it to my instructors and they just handed it back to me like immediately like 65 pages I'm not going to read this. hey we're gonna pre-game there's a little hint but a little hint for everybody let's say you're going to watch the UFC at your friend's house or you're going to you know your wife's got a friend that has some part you know whatever you're going to some unknown realm will you're not sure what's gonna be eating pre-game with a mulk pre-game with a mulk that way they show up look they show up with you know pizza and instead of eating nine pieces of pizza you just had a mulk you're so correct you're so good maybe have apiece Like I had Brian Shantosh, who was Silverstar, I had Marcus Mines, who he got relieved recently as a tank manner, but in terms of like deep thinker, warfighter, like there was no better. And I was like, size them up like you joke in and he's like, no, I told you you're going to be never chopster. America closes Bogram airfield like in a really kind of weird way of just leaving just kind of up and left without telling anyone didn't even tell the Afghan that that was going to happen the Afghan government that was going to happen just did it and by the way the bag room Bogram is you know is a great logistics hub it's a big massive airfield to well supplied well supported how long has it been there for 20 years you know 19 years some incredible amount of time so it's an relatively secure area fully functional and we just kind of leave it July 8th but like it wasn't like everybody knew hey when your friend your gunny and your wife for all like hey dude take take it down But I wanted the masters I wanted to challenge myself and most instructors there implore almost like they drive you towards writing something about like the tactical level small squad unit level like insightful novel idea. One time one of the companies found a house full of, it looked like propane tanks, but I was like aluminum tanks filled with powder, found like a hundred of them. and you know you're a perfect example of a guy that's going to get interviewed and have they're going to interview with questions four sound bites that they can make headlines that the people will click that's their goal and so you know having you on here to actually give your perspective your full perspective say whatever you want like that's the goal so people can actually hear and understand where you're coming from and I think that's important So there was a time when I was like, I'm a professional and I've been doing multiple wars, like the fucking talk to me like that. When we came out of the creek bed there was like five afghanies sitting there with like their arms crossed, staring at us and we're like, let's look at these in the various characters. but I'm not sitting there as a obedient you know slave as to what I'm being told this what you're being told do do it I always pushed back on my leadership throughout my career always had that rebellious streak and this just kind of like do you when you look back at your life do you notice things along the way that are indicators that you had sort of a limit to what you take I mean what's movie at movie reference what's the movie reference where the guy is like an accountant or something And I was like one of the things where you like, you both come around a corner and you're like, based a phase. but I like that night I slept on the couch and I bring that up just to illustrate like that's how stressful it was it was just like was she mad just basically because you see where you were torpedoing your own career I'll call you and keep in mind I didn't do my observability based on that story I told and as a major you gotta do what's called key billet and burn infantry officer that's up so our exo so coming out of command staff they're like you have to be an exo to remain competitive and so I mean everybody got orders in like January February March I mean there couldn't be a better historical example of how that was just terribly executed and it's just a symptom of a much larger problem and so a lot of these opinions I had in command of staff solidified through my paper and you know I left there I told the story about me handing the paper to the PhDs because that's just another example of like no one really cared they were there to expose you to the things that they were exposed to but they didn't look at like where Stoo Schiller was academically and say how do we get Stoo Schiller individually to be more challenged and developed to where we need him to be and I got to talk them through like what the strategic perspective is what it looks like over the long term and and how to make the next step forward so good good lesson learned and and again from my from just talking to you today I think you still would have made the same you would come to the same conclusion that this is something that I don't want to use the word passionate not that she's just that you were passionate about it And that was like the moment for me, or was like, oh my god, like this is real. and you know we all heard the hey if you don't have your health you don't have anything like you know like that whole thing I mean
