[00:00:00] This is Jockel Pontcast number 316 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening.
[00:00:06] I can't get any. December 18th 2018, General Jim Madness resigned as a secretary defense
[00:00:19] for Donald Trump and he did that. He wrote a letter and in that letter he said quote
[00:00:25] because you have the right to a secretary of defense whose views are better aligned with yours.
[00:00:31] I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. Then clearly General Madness
[00:00:39] did not agree with what Donald Trump was doing or how Donald Trump was doing, what he was doing.
[00:00:47] And so he stepped down and you can read that letter online, the letter of resignation and it's
[00:00:53] he did it in as respectfully as he could. I think after he did that, things went a little bit worse
[00:01:01] between the two of them. But the initial statement was certainly meant to be done in a
[00:01:06] respectful way to from the secretary of defense to the commander and chief, but it was certainly a statement
[00:01:13] by him stepping down. When that happened, I was definitely disappointed to see General Madness
[00:01:23] leaving that position. And because then it's a situation where he no longer has any influence
[00:01:31] over what's happening. And General Madness, I highly respected Marine and leader in the military.
[00:01:38] But this kind of thing has happened before. A hard-reline was taken by Colonel David Hackworth
[00:01:46] when he spoke out against both military and civilian leadership in his interview
[00:01:54] toward the end of the Vietnam War. Interview with a news program called Issues and Answers
[00:01:59] Sunday June 7th, 1971. Here's some things. Here's some excerpts from that interview and the whole
[00:02:06] interview is in the book about face. But some of the excerpts from that he's been interviewed by a
[00:02:12] guy named Mr. Tuckner. Mr. Tuckner said in your view, did poor training lead to higher casualties
[00:02:17] in Vietnam? Colonel Hackworth replied, I am convinced of it. I think that our casualties were at least
[00:02:24] 30% higher because of or even higher than that. But I'd say just safely 30% because of troops that
[00:02:31] were not properly trained. I participated in a study group in the Pentagon in 67 and 68,
[00:02:37] which considered U.S. casualties caused by friendly fires. And the group was composed of highly
[00:02:42] experienced personnel that had served in Vietnam and it was our conclusion that 15 to 20% of the
[00:02:46] casualties caused in Vietnam were the result of friendly fire. One man shooting another man, artillery,
[00:02:52] friendly fire, friendly artillery fire firing on a friendly element. Friendly helicopters firing on a
[00:02:59] friendly unit. Tuck air strike on a friendly unit. And I could count you in my own case, countless
[00:03:06] personal examples. For example, during the Battle of Dactu, June of the 17th, the rocket ship came
[00:03:12] into my A company's position by mistake and released its rockets right on top of the company
[00:03:17] killing the executive officer and wounding 29 other troopers. I can recall in September of 1965
[00:03:26] as my battalion was deployed artillery was fired in the wrong place killing seven men in one of my
[00:03:31] pletounds. The interview goes on. Mr. Tuckerner says, the upper echelon of the army
[00:03:40] really ever become changed on this war. Did they learn from their mistakes? Colonel Hackworth,
[00:03:47] I don't think so. I don't think that the top level ever developed the realistic strategic plan
[00:03:53] nor did they ever have tactics to support that strategic plan. And that is why perhaps we
[00:03:59] who have not been vocal should be charged for criminal neglect because it is our obligation.
[00:04:05] It is our responsibility not only to train our soldiers well, to lead our soldiers well,
[00:04:10] but to make sure that there are no mistakes made. That they are protected as well as possible
[00:04:15] from mistakes in error. And once you make mistakes, they must be surfaced, critiqued,
[00:04:20] identified, and remedial action taken. The interview goes on and it closes out with this,
[00:04:31] Mr. Tuckerner asks, Colonel, do you feel it is possible? You have become too emotionally involved
[00:04:38] in Vietnam. Colonel Hackworth replies, I have become emotionally involved in Vietnam.
[00:04:46] One couldn't have spent the number of years I have spent Vietnam without becoming emotionally
[00:04:51] involved. One couldn't see the number of young studs die or be terribly wounded without
[00:04:56] becoming emotionally involved. I just have seen the American nation spend so much of it's wonderful
[00:05:02] great young men in this country. I've seen our national wealth being drained away. I see the
[00:05:07] nation being split apart and almost being split a sonner because of this war. And I am wondering
[00:05:12] to what end it is all going to lead to? Obviously, Hackworth was drummed out of the army shortly after
[00:05:26] that interview. Hackworth and Mattis are not the first people to resign in protest or because they
[00:05:34] didn't agree with what was happening. In fact, another guy that Hackworth refers to this general
[00:05:42] William Billy Mitchell, father of the Air Force World War I, commanded the first aircraft,
[00:05:47] our first American aircraft, World War I and after the war he started to build the Air Force.
[00:05:54] And guess what? The army and the Navy kind of objected to it because they thought that their ways were
[00:06:00] better. And he conducted field tests against Navy ships, use an aircraft and proved that we need
[00:06:09] it air power. And there was a Navy air ship like a blimp called the Shannon Della crashed in
[00:06:19] 1925, 14 crew were killed. And Mitchell, general Mitchell protested to the press openly accusing
[00:06:27] the war department of quote incompetence and criminal negligence saying quote, brave airmen are
[00:06:34] being sent to their deaths by armchair animals who don't care about their safety. Mitchell was
[00:06:40] court-martialed, convicted of an insubordination and facing a five-year suspension he resigned his
[00:06:47] commission. 1949. The Secretary of the Navy resigned as the construction of the supercarrier
[00:06:58] the USS United States was cut to pay for the Air Force B36 Long Range bomber program.
[00:07:09] If you ever read the book, Derr-Election of Duty by a German master, another highly respected
[00:07:16] general. And one of the things he refers to during the Vietnam War that the joint chiefs of staff
[00:07:23] for Lyndon B. Johnson, he calls them five silent men because they didn't push back on some of the
[00:07:31] things or a lot of the things or all of the things that LBJ and McNamara were doing.
[00:07:37] The Army Chief, Harold Johnson, General Harold Johnson, said after his retirement. After he retired.
[00:07:47] He said quote, I remember the day I was ready to go over to the overall office and give my
[00:07:51] four stars to the president and tell him quote, you have refused to tell the country they cannot
[00:07:56] fight a war without mobilization. You have required me to send men into battle with little
[00:07:59] hope of their ultimate victory and you have forced us into the military and forced the military
[00:08:04] to violate almost every one of the principles of war in Vietnam. Therefore, I resigned and I will
[00:08:09] hold a press conference after I walk out of your door. But of course he didn't do that. That's
[00:08:18] something he said later. General Wallace Green, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Chief.
[00:08:26] And this is a guy that in World War II fought the Japanese with a 45 caliber pistol and a
[00:08:35] bay in that. And he says in that same book, in that book, by McMaster, he says something along the lines
[00:08:44] of, well, if I resign in protest, okay, I'm in the headlines for 48 hours, then what?
[00:08:48] Then I'm gone and someone else carries on. I don't have an impact. And that's a decent point.
[00:08:52] It's a legitimate point made by Green. Same thing I said about matters. When you leave, again,
[00:08:59] it's a decision. But when you leave, you've got to realize that your influence has gone.
[00:09:06] 1968, Cyrus Vance, who was a World War II Navy Gunner officer, he did resign as LBJ's
[00:09:17] deputy secretary of defense in protest to what was going on in Vietnam, which he initially believed in
[00:09:24] Vietnam War. But as he saw it unfold, he said, this is not a good idea and he eventually resigned.
[00:09:31] He also later resigned as a secretary of state for Carter, for Jimmy Carter, in protest of
[00:09:37] desert one, because he thought that we should negotiate more. He did that two times.
[00:09:45] I don't think either one of them had a huge impact. 1997 Air Force Chief of Staff decorated Vietnam
[00:09:52] War pilot resigned at the perceived punishment that was to be imposed on the commanders on the
[00:09:59] ground when the co-bar towers were attacked in Saudi Arabia. 2006, a guy named Aaron Watata,
[00:10:09] Army refused to go to Iraq and believe in the war resigned.
[00:10:18] Matthew Ho, a former Marine infantry officer. In 2009, resigned in protest as a senior
[00:10:26] political civilian representative in Zabbal Province in Afghanistan, wrote a scathing letter.
[00:10:32] Can read that online. 2021 Lieutenant Colonel Paul Douglas Hague resigned in objection to quote
[00:10:44] traitorous withdrawal from Afghanistan and also talked about an ideological Marxist takeover
[00:10:52] of the military and the United States government at the repression lines resigned. So, these things happen.
[00:11:07] And I talked about this in the book, Leader of Strasgeon Tactics. I talked about
[00:11:12] when you should do this, how you make that decision, because when you resign or even when you speak
[00:11:17] out aggressively and ostracize yourself as a leader, you no longer have influence over the situation.
[00:11:27] You're gone. Maybe your statement will bring about enough
[00:11:36] highlight. We'll bring enough light on the subject that you can help, that your resignation can help.
[00:11:42] That's what you hope for. But it's not guaranteed. And you may cause excess conflict inside
[00:11:53] the organization you're trying to help. But then there are times when things have gone too far
[00:12:01] or a line has been crossed in your head and you feel you just simply cannot tolerate
[00:12:06] things the way they are. And you've tried to use internal methods to influence the situation,
[00:12:16] but it hasn't worked. So you step out and you speak out. And this is happened recently.
[00:12:25] I'm reading horror, Lieutenant Colonel, Stewart Scheller, spoke out about the disastrous
[00:12:31] withdrawal from Afghanistan. I need to do this publicly and without authorization from his
[00:12:39] chain of command. And for that and for other actions that he took he was relieved of his command.
[00:12:47] He was a prisoned court martial, punished, required to depart the Marine Corps without retirement
[00:12:54] or benefits, which is a steep price to pay to speak your mind on what you're seeing and that
[00:13:02] is a hard decision to make. And it has consequences that will reverberate for years.
[00:13:10] They have lessons. Hard lessons will be learned. And tonight we have a chance to learn some of
[00:13:19] those lessons directly from the source as Stewart Scheller, former Lieutenant Colonel, former
[00:13:26] United States Marine, is here with us tonight to discuss what happened. Stu, thanks for joining us.
[00:13:36] Jack, thanks for having me that intro gave me chills, really laid that up for y'all.
[00:13:40] I'm so excited to be here, Peco, out of the port of the conversation.
[00:13:43] Let's start at the beginning just to get some background on you as a human. So where do you grow up?
[00:13:51] I grew up across the Midwest. My dad was just an insurance salesman. I worked his way up.
[00:13:56] So we moved between Missouri, Kansas, Ohio. I ended up going to high school in college at the
[00:14:01] University of Cincinnati, high school in Cincinnati too. Then I moved out to Virginia again,
[00:14:07] accounting degree at the University of Missouri. When you were in high school, what was your mom
[00:14:10] working? Mom was a state at home. Mom, so I've got two brothers in a sister. So four siblings,
[00:14:16] she was always there for us driving us to soccer practice. I was a baseball soccer player.
[00:14:21] Any good? Yeah, I was a all-state soccer player. I got a full ride, played a couple of seasons.
[00:14:27] And yeah, I was always a captain, always a leader, enjoyed competitive sports.
[00:14:33] Did you make it to the state champion tubes? You know, in Ohio they had, I don't know if they
[00:14:38] still got it, but they had a, it was called ODP. It was like a Olympic development program.
[00:14:43] So you got to try out for these regional ODP teams and I made the team and I don't think we ever
[00:14:47] won anything significant. What position did you play? I played all over. I mean, I played club high
[00:14:52] school college. So usually I was a skinny runner. I was a lot of skinnier back in the day. I was probably
[00:14:58] you know, 140 through high school. So I was usually outside half back sprinting, but as I got a little
[00:15:03] more muscle, they put me back in the defense. And then when I got to college, I was again
[00:15:06] smaller, so they quickly back on the outside midfield. And were you into school getting good grades
[00:15:12] in all that? Yeah, schools always come pretty easy for me. So I was always on the honor roll.
[00:15:16] I put in the work. I always got 35 to 40. Yeah. I mean, I'd say if you put in the work? Yeah.
[00:15:24] That's a big, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I like to have fun. I like to play sports. And so school wasn't
[00:15:30] always my focus, but I knew getting a good education and you know, wanting to build a good
[00:15:35] base was important. So if I put in the work of homework, I'd always do well. But there were
[00:15:39] times where I just wouldn't do it. And then you know, you pay the consequences. Did you have interest
[00:15:43] in the military growing up? I didn't. So my grandfather landed at Normandy. And I looked up to him a
[00:15:49] lot, but after his army service and World War II, he got out was in the federal service. And his
[00:15:55] brother was in the FBI. So that's why I got my accounting degree. They were telling me, get your accounting
[00:15:59] degree, you can go in the FBI. So I always loved America. I always wanted to serve. But no one in my
[00:16:05] immediate family, other than my grandfather was in the military. So through high school, all I knew
[00:16:09] was I needed to go to college and get a degree. Then a good job would be on the backside. And I was
[00:16:15] getting an accounting degree. And I thought maybe I'd go in a federal service. But that was kind of
[00:16:18] my thought process all the way through school. What year did you graduate high school?
[00:16:21] 2000 high school, 2004 college. So September 11th happened when you were in college?
[00:16:26] That's right. So was it, was it, was it, was kind of impacted that have on you? Yeah, good question. So
[00:16:30] I was my sophomore season of soccer. And we had I was living in the dorms. And it was like a
[00:16:37] sweet where it was like four bedrooms in the living room. And I remember sitting there with my teammates
[00:16:41] watching it and thinking, well, this is significant. Our lives are going to change. But I don't know
[00:16:47] how this is going to impact me. And then like I said, I just went back to, I need to graduate college
[00:16:52] as well as what I'm supposed to do. So even most of my peers joined after September 11th and that
[00:16:56] was like their motivation. It was different for me. Mine came a little bit later. So I saw September 11th
[00:17:01] it impacted me like all Americans. But I continued just going through school. Still not even
[00:17:07] sure that I was going to join the military at that time. So at what point did you get serious about
[00:17:12] joining the military? So I graduated with that kind of degree. Started working as an account and did
[00:17:17] not enjoy working as an account. And it was 2004. And I was watching the TV and I saw the Marines
[00:17:24] moving through Felicia. And I thought, hey, we're going to probably be at war for another five
[00:17:29] ten years. I'd love an opportunity to go represent America, be a leader on the edge of the empire.
[00:17:35] I've always been competitive being on teams. And I just thought, you know, I could go on the FBI
[00:17:41] anytime. But this war may not always be going on and I want the opportunity to serve my country.
[00:17:46] And so I called the Marine Recreeter and started my path. So really it was 2004 for me watching
[00:17:51] the Marines on TV. There was like, I need to get me some of that. How long were you an account
[00:17:55] in a four? Not long. I did it part time as I was going through school. And then I did it for probably
[00:18:02] nine months after I graduated. Didn't pick long enough. It was a hit. Grunt and Felicia looked better.
[00:18:08] It did. Yeah. You're looking at looking at spreadsheets. 100%. That's not for everybody.
[00:18:14] So so how long did the recruiting process take in 2000? And so in 2004 you talked to the
[00:18:20] recruiter for the first time? That's right. Yeah, that was quick. I talked to him
[00:18:24] probably in September. And the hardest part was getting all the recommendations.
[00:18:29] Like, you need college professors recommendations. Like university Cincinnati was like 1,
[00:18:33] me 300. None of my instructors knew me. You know, I had a like, call me back up. Like, hey,
[00:18:37] you don't know me, but can you fill this out? You know, and I didn't accomplish anything at that
[00:18:42] point of my life other than being a soccer captain. So what, what did I have other than a college
[00:18:47] degree and being on a sports team? And so you're supposed to write all these accolades and
[00:18:50] accomplishments in extracurricular. And so what honestly when I thought about the application,
[00:18:54] I was like, they're not going to select me. But I submitted it and my strength was athleticism. So
[00:19:00] I smoked the PFT and that was easy for me. And within two months, they selected me and I shipped out
[00:19:07] in January. And where's Marine Corros, yes? It's in Quonico. How was that?
[00:19:12] I think for some people. How did that compare to accounting? I think for some people,
[00:19:17] it's a lot of, there's a lot of prior listed guys to go through. And I didn't know anything about
[00:19:21] the military. I mean, I didn't know the difference between officers and enlisted. I didn't know
[00:19:24] the drill instructors were going to scream at us. I quite honestly thought I'd show up and it would be
[00:19:28] like grown man rules and, you know, here's the challenge figured out. You know, I just, I don't know why
[00:19:34] that's what I thought it would be. And it just, it was not that. And so, you know, the drill instructors
[00:19:39] all start screaming at you and they have you dump your bags and they kick your stuff all over the
[00:19:43] parade deck. And I noticed when they were doing that, all my peers had their stuff in Zipbox bags
[00:19:48] because they expected it. And I'm like the one guy who's just lost. So my pens and my stuff were going
[00:19:54] everywhere. And of course, on the last one, trying to collect it all up. And so now I've got like
[00:19:58] five drill instructors circle in me. And I'm like fighting through their shins to get the rest of
[00:20:02] my stuff. And so I tell the story just to say, it was illustrated from day one that I was lost. And
[00:20:07] then, you know, they kind of kept coming hard at me. But my strength was like I said, athleticism
[00:20:12] and then relationships. So I was able to befriended all the guys around me, learn from them. And
[00:20:18] you know, I quickly went, we do peer evaluations there too. So like in the first peer evaluation,
[00:20:23] I was at the bottom because I was lost. But by the third one, I was like in the top third, right?
[00:20:27] And so that meant a lot to me. So I was able to demonstrate to my peers over the period of
[00:20:31] instruction that like, hey, there might be more of this guy than the lost little puppy we saw on day one.
[00:20:36] And so that was kind of the story of my whole entry level training. I mean, I was like,
[00:20:40] do they get rid of guys that are consistently at the bottom of the peer evaluations?
[00:20:43] They do. So the way it works is they do a board system. And so there's three boards through
[00:20:49] OCS. And if you get essentially counseling, so if you're at the bottom, they're going to give you
[00:20:53] counseling. And once you get a collection of them that you sit in front of the kernel and have to just
[00:20:57] a fire where you're there. And he's ultimately the one that decides to cut you or not. And then also at OCS,
[00:21:03] you can quit. You can drop on request. And so it's actually pretty high attrition. So we started with
[00:21:08] 65, and I think we got down like 38. So I mean, but most of it is people that probably shouldn't be there anyway,
[00:21:16] quite honestly. There are some some very talented guys that I had one guy that made it to the last day.
[00:21:22] The day before graduation, this guy graduated from the University of Chicago with a mathematics
[00:21:26] degree. And I remember I'm very clearly because his last name was Sullivan and my name was Scheller.
[00:21:30] So I'm standing right next to him in the racks the whole time in the day before he just like,
[00:21:34] I don't want to commission. And I was like, too, we just went through like 10 weeks of the crisis.
[00:21:38] And I was like, and he said, I just wanted to see if I could do it. So that's like the type of guy that you want,
[00:21:44] you know. And so I was just blown away by that. And so then this guy made it like he had graduated
[00:21:48] for all extensive purposes and just decided now. And so there are some that go through all that.
[00:21:54] And then wave off. But the vast majority that I saw get a treat it out,
[00:21:59] probably need to be a treat it out. And then you go roll from right from there to the basics school.
[00:22:03] That's right. And how how how was that? Six months. So what they do is they just give you a baseline of
[00:22:11] infantry leadership skills. They say it's not screening. Technically they're only supposed to screen
[00:22:16] at OCS. Yeah, give you my later my career. I worked as an instructor at OCS and TBS. And so I
[00:22:21] understand like behind the scenes of these two places in Tmoly now too. But TBS is for all the open
[00:22:27] ground contracts like myself where they ultimately determine what your MOS is going to be your
[00:22:31] military occupational specialty. So it's a very critical spot in terms of if you want to do something
[00:22:36] specific you got to distinguish yourself to be able to get that thing. And you learn a lot.
[00:22:41] It's more of a college atmosphere unlike OCS, Officer Candice Corps, Infantry Officer
[00:22:46] Corps, which is like all fieldwork. TBS is like a lot of classroom work. You do some field exercises
[00:22:51] just to kind of have a baseline of tactical knowledge. But it's a lot of classroom stuff.
[00:22:56] You said open ground. What is that? Open ground contract. So when you come in you either come in
[00:23:02] as a law contract and air contract law like jag. Yes. Okay. Yep. So law, air or ground. Those are
[00:23:10] the three. And so. Yeah. Bottom line is when you're at TBS they can't manipulate the law or air
[00:23:16] contracts. Those are already prewritten. But everybody else they determine their military
[00:23:20] occupational specialty at TBS. And how did you perform in TBS overall? I was the same thing.
[00:23:27] I showed up. I was lost. Quick story on that. So there's a transition where you go from
[00:23:33] sleeves down to sleeves up in the Marine Corps. You know, lost Lieutenant Schiller didn't know that.
[00:23:38] No one explained it to me. OCS. And so we show up. And so the transition happened to be just
[00:23:42] between the 10 days we had between OCS and TBS. So I show up to check in and I'm the only one
[00:23:48] with my sleeves down. And everyone's like, what did you ever sleeves up? What am I like?
[00:23:52] Oh, yeah. So that again day one. I'm the one that doesn't know anything. And it was the same thing
[00:23:57] period of hours. You know, I had to like work my way up and I did. And I was academically probably
[00:24:03] in the bottom third just because all the tests. It was just rogue memorization. And I tried to
[00:24:09] memorize it. A lot of guys had been in the Marine Corps before. It was just a little bit easier
[00:24:13] because they knew the knowledge inherently. But what got me up was like leadership evaluations
[00:24:19] are weighted pretty heavily. And I always did really good on the leadership evaluations.
[00:24:22] How does that work? Was it like you're in a field problem? Someone who's watching you and
[00:24:25] evaluate and how you're doing? Yeah. So the grade breakdown at TBS is 40% leadership,
[00:24:29] 30% academic and 30% physical. And the leadership is built upon different exercises where
[00:24:35] you're evaluated by your instructor. So it's fed by things that you do, but still ultimately
[00:24:41] it's subjective. And even in the leadership score, what they do is so if a Platoon Commander
[00:24:45] has like 50 guys, they have to rank you one through 50. So they can't give everybody hundreds.
[00:24:50] So to make it fair, there's actually an algorithm where they have to stick it in. And so that's
[00:24:55] how you get a leadership grade. What's a is it just a typical sort of battle field problem that
[00:25:02] they're putting you on? You run an ambush? Are you running a patrol? Or is it like, what's it like?
[00:25:07] What are they grade new on? Yep. So some of them are leadership reaction courses where it's like a
[00:25:11] complex. It's not complex, but there's a problem that you have to solve. And typically they're
[00:25:17] not solvable, but they're determining how you navigate the situation that's not solvable.
[00:25:22] There's situations where you just, you're the patrol leader. Hey, take your squad and go
[00:25:26] attack this fire team on this hill and they'll evaluate you based on that, right? There's
[00:25:31] peer evaluations feed into it. So there's quite a few, probably about five or six different things
[00:25:37] that you do. Mostly, I think the probably the heaviest way is the in the tree line, you're a squad leader.
[00:25:43] So typically comes down to your squad leader, you're doing next to, you're doing next to one,
[00:25:47] which stands for field exercise. So they have all these field exercises and they just make you a leader of
[00:25:52] whatever, you're doing the defense, build the defense order and brief it and that's going to be a
[00:25:56] big part of your leadership grade. Are you guys shooting blanks at each other? Yeah, we are.
[00:26:01] Are you using miles gear or some equivalent or some? We have miles. It's now called it it's actually
[00:26:06] it has two now, same thing, but it doesn't work very well in the tree line. What it does do those,
[00:26:11] it provides graphical overlay. So if you're wanting a debriefet, like you can show, hey,
[00:26:15] there is the LPOP, there was the support by fire. So quite honestly, when we use it, it's more
[00:26:20] for after action purposes. It doesn't, it just doesn't work very well in the tree line. So blanks
[00:26:24] is we found to be better. And then what did you, what, so where did you graduate in the class?
[00:26:29] When you came time to graduate? So the way TBS works is they put it into thirds and so they do that,
[00:26:34] so that one MOS isn't overloaded with all the talent. So if you're in the top there, you get your first pick.
[00:26:41] If you're in the top of the second, the second pick. If you're in the top of the third,
[00:26:45] you get the third pick. So if you came this thing of everyone wanting to be like the top of the third
[00:26:49] third, then you're like, you're playing the numbers game. Like I said, I started in the bottom third,
[00:26:56] and I was like, but because of my leadership grades, I moved up to, I think, the top of the second third,
[00:27:01] the thing is where I ended up. And then you get their pick. So what'd you pick?
[00:27:05] I actually, I wanted to be infantry and at OCS, I said to my drill instructor, I wanted to be an infantry officer.
[00:27:13] In fact, when I was going through the recruiting pipeline, I also even told me that the guy
[00:27:17] does my recruiting is like, I got an air contract and I was like, no, I want to be on the ground with the gun.
[00:27:20] You know, watching the TV, Marines, Flushos, I got one of the underground with the gun,
[00:27:24] and the leader. So at OCS, then I told him, I was like, I want to be an infantry officer,
[00:27:27] and they just were like, and very tri-off, so shell-eyed, you know, and what kind of like,
[00:27:32] why were they freaking out about that? I think it's just all part of the show.
[00:27:36] It's a song and dance, right? They just want to kind of knock you down.
[00:27:39] I'm, in fact, some of them are still friends with me, but at the time, you just don't really fully
[00:27:44] appreciate it. And so, those were kind of still bouncing around in my head. So when I got to TVS,
[00:27:49] I actually had infantry number three. So I put combat engineer and intel officer above it,
[00:27:55] one, two, and three. And my, they call them SBC staff, we'll take commander, he's a captain,
[00:28:00] he was a infantry officer, and he just looked at me and he was like, shillard,
[00:28:02] you're going to be a fucking infantry officer. That's, but, and I thought it was joking. I was like,
[00:28:06] all right. Yeah. And then the game time resliction, I was waiting for him to be like,
[00:28:10] you know, intel officer, combat engineer and take infantry officer. And I was like,
[00:28:14] size them up like you joke in and he's like, no, I told you you're going to be never
[00:28:17] chopster. And, you know, looking back, there is no way I would have made it as long as I did,
[00:28:23] had I had any intel officer. Other than infantry officer, I just didn't know what I did know
[00:28:26] then. I mean, it's by far probably the best choice. And so, in a lot of ways, like I shaped my
[00:28:32] life and career. And I was really, really grateful to do that. So then you get infantry,
[00:28:37] doesn't it's often infantry officer school? That's right. And how long is that school? Three months.
[00:28:41] And how was that? When it was it? So I went through OCS, January to March of the five TBS,
[00:28:47] April to September of five, and IOC, September to December of five. So it was rapid fire. There
[00:28:53] a lot of times there's because based on when schools pick up, people will have two or three
[00:28:57] months breaks. But for me, you just worked out where in 11 months from showing up to OCS,
[00:29:02] I was standing in front of my potatoes. So by mid December, I was there. And you must have been
[00:29:06] getting guys that were coming fresh back from actually coming back from Feluzia that you watched
[00:29:12] on TV that were your instructors. It's better than that when I showed up to one eight, one eight
[00:29:16] was the center battalion of that attack that I watched on the TV. And the first speech I gave
[00:29:21] my potatoes like, hey, I'm your new Platoon Commander, half of them were in sweats. And so I
[00:29:25] took my Platoon Sergeant aside after the fact, I was like, hey, what? Why aren't they in the
[00:29:27] proper uniform? Because, sure, they all have doctors notes because they all have a trap and I'll
[00:29:31] still in their body from the push through Feluzia. And that was like the moment for me, or was like,
[00:29:35] oh my god, like this is real. And it's just like the way the world hits you of the
[00:29:40] responsibility. So yes, it was very real when I showed up to my units. How was infrastructure
[00:29:45] off your school? That is probably one of the best schools, Barnan. I mean, they really do a
[00:29:51] good job of preparing you. And I mean, there are just three months of intense
[00:29:57] intense infantry training. And I really felt prepared, shown up from my putin. I mean,
[00:30:02] the, the Marine Corps does a great job of putting a product in for the Platoon in terms of officers.
[00:30:07] Now, are you going to get some that slip through the cracks? Absolutely. There is no perfect
[00:30:11] system, but I'll say holistically from a guy that just wanted to learn and wanted to be a leader.
[00:30:15] They did a really good job of preparing me. Sure, they set up. Are you an upatoon in your
[00:30:19] basically taking turns as leaders going out and running operations? That's right. The whole time.
[00:30:23] The whole time. It's an an infantry officer, of course. It's a lot more current TTPs as well.
[00:30:30] Whereas the basic school is the fundamentals in green side of building the defense,
[00:30:34] very conventional type stuff. The timeless principles, whereas infantry officer, of course,
[00:30:39] is like this is the new RCO. This is the IED that's in Ramadi right now. So on and so forth. This is
[00:30:45] how we do patrol and 5 and 25s right now. And so there's still a lot of timeless stuff that
[00:30:51] goes on in IOC, but it was really nice to get a lot of current TTPs coming through that schoolhouse.
[00:30:56] And then the instructors too, at IOC, if you're a captain and you're in a instructor there,
[00:31:01] your hands selected and most of those guys go on to become generals, quite honestly.
[00:31:04] So you get the Kremlin terms of young captains that have just come off their first tour,
[00:31:09] like the Marine Corps picks the best. To go to TBS and then from TBS they pick the best at a TBS
[00:31:13] to go to IOC. And so you really just get great instructors. Like I had Brian Shantosh,
[00:31:19] who was Silverstar, I had Marcus Mines, who he got relieved recently as a tank manner,
[00:31:24] but in terms of like deep thinker, warfighter, like there was no better. I just had a group.
[00:31:31] It's quite funny when you look at my instructors. A lot of them burnt out, like the Shantoshes
[00:31:36] in the mines, but I don't think I've ever ran into a group of officers that maybe were
[00:31:41] more outside the box thinkers and warfighters than that instructor cadre that I had there.
[00:31:47] When you look back at that time, is there any lessons that stand out to you? Like, oh yeah,
[00:31:51] that operation left the huge impact on me. I think just the mental toughness that the
[00:32:01] instructors have pressed upon me every single day is what I left with. I mean, I walked away
[00:32:08] with an impression that these infantry officers are the real deal, they're warfighters,
[00:32:13] and they know they're trade. Like it was very clear to me that I had to step up my game and I
[00:32:20] couldn't fake the funk because people could see right through it. I think the TTPs always change,
[00:32:27] but the thirst for going and opening the pub and making sure that you knew more than everyone else,
[00:32:33] making sure that in those tough situations, you were the guy they were looking to to have
[00:32:38] the direction to have that mental toughness that they might need. You guys doing live fire,
[00:32:43] blanks both? Mostly live fire. I also see as mostly live fire. Obviously you're not shooting
[00:32:48] live fire each other. So in the situations where we did for some force, it was blanks, but it was
[00:32:54] a ton of live fire. Did you learn anything about like the amount of pressure that you were going
[00:32:59] to face? Did they do a good job of simulating the pressure you're going to face in combat situations?
[00:33:04] Yeah, I mean, that was the whole stick. I mean, there was even a couple of times where it may
[00:33:09] be even swung too far to the other direction because I remember one time we were getting close to
[00:33:14] graduating and we had gone from the desert of Mojave up to the mountains of Bridgeport and then
[00:33:20] we were coming off the mountains of Bridgeport and they stopped at some like Rinky Dink casino.
[00:33:26] Just let us get drunk. It was like in a middle nowhere. We're probably knowing when we'd
[00:33:29] get in trouble because it was literally in the middle nowhere. Well, the director, this guy is
[00:33:35] still in the Marine Corps, the regimental commander, or probably moved on by now. But he got,
[00:33:41] so he was the major and he just got hammered drunk and started screaming at the lieutenant so
[00:33:46] that they weren't ready for combat, right? And I was like one of the few times where like,
[00:33:51] you know, I'm still young and the curtain had been peeled back, but I remember thinking like,
[00:33:55] I get it. You got more experiences than me, but I'm about to knock you the fuck out.
[00:33:58] Like, you know, to mean Lieutenant the major, like you don't talk to me like that.
[00:34:01] And so yes, they did a very good job of preparing us, but sometimes I felt like
[00:34:07] almost to the point where it was, you got a little on professional times. You know, there's a line
[00:34:12] on how you treat a man. I'll rise to the occasion when given the opportunity, but I don't want to be
[00:34:17] denigrated. And then from there, it's bad. It's serious. That's when you went to one eight.
[00:34:24] That's right. Yep. So in fact, most of the guys, because we graduated right before Christmas,
[00:34:29] most of my fellow students took Christmas break and then showed up in January. One eight was deploying
[00:34:33] so fast that the batinax, so I actually came up, diocy took me and my six peers that were going
[00:34:38] to one eight and said, I need you now. We're going to AP Hill right after Christmas, and I want you
[00:34:43] checked in with all your gear, meet your potions, and then you can take, you know, week for Christmas,
[00:34:47] and you're going to show up and go to AP Hill with us, and so that's what we did.
[00:34:51] And you already talked about meat and your potion for the first time. Yeah.
[00:34:55] Yeah, so there was that. And I went into the, you know, I didn't have a house. So my personal life,
[00:35:00] I was dating my, my girlfriend at the time, and I had gotten engaged. I got engaged that
[00:35:06] Christmas. That week that I had off, actually. I take that back. I got engaged before I went to
[00:35:11] ACS. So when I, she was working in Richmond, when I went down to one eight, she stayed in Richmond.
[00:35:18] And so I was living in like this shitty apartment. Maybe because that new I was going to
[00:35:22] deploy in six months. My plan all along was to just do the first tour and then go up to Richmond
[00:35:27] and get out and be with my wife. We got married in between TBS and IOC. In fact,
[00:35:33] Marcus minds that guy was telling you about those such a good instructor. The IOC,
[00:35:37] they call it combat endurance test. This is like their screening event. It's like a two
[00:35:41] thirds of a marathon. It's like 16 miles. And they got like little stations like 84,
[00:35:46] do the 84 radio, do the radio. And then about 10 miles in, one of the stations is ground fighting.
[00:35:52] Marcus minds was a college wrestler. And so, you know, you were just exhausted at this point.
[00:35:57] And this guy gets to just beat up on tired little to tennis, right? Like, good job dude.
[00:36:02] So that's what he does. And I know I'm trying everything I can to fight him. And I thought I
[00:36:08] was doing pretty good. And I think because I was doing pretty good, he started getting a little bit
[00:36:10] more violent. And he elbowed me in the eye and gave me a black eye. And I got married that week.
[00:36:16] So when all my wedding pictures and I was black eyes, listening there. So yeah, one eight. Sorry. So
[00:36:22] AP Hill in January to March. And then we actually, we went on deployment in June of 06.
[00:36:27] And where was that deployment too? So at that time, everyone was going to Iraq. So that's
[00:36:32] all we trained for. That marked that January to June was like, we're going to Iraq. There was
[00:36:37] middle question about it. But we're not going to fly there. We're going to get on what we call a
[00:36:41] mu marine expeditionary unit. You get on three Navy ships and you sail over there. Back in that
[00:36:46] day in 06, it was a, it was a much bigger footprint. Back then, the naval group had a submarine.
[00:36:53] They had destroyers. I mean, it was a whole entourage back then. But over time, it just
[00:36:58] Navy's degradation. It's now just the three ships. So we got on the ships. We sailed across the Atlantic.
[00:37:05] We went through the Suez, which is like a million a ship. So that would just fiscally,
[00:37:10] you know once you cross the Suez and you're in St. Com, like, game on. But when that happened,
[00:37:15] Israel and Lebanon got into a conflict. This was in like June or July of 06. And so they actually
[00:37:21] turned us around and it's back to the Suez. And then we did a neo non-combatant evacuation operation.
[00:37:26] And we took American citizens out of Bay Route. We sent up a tune in there to secure the embassy.
[00:37:31] And then we took them to Cyprus. And then we sat there and stared at Bay Route for like six weeks.
[00:37:35] Like I just did pushups every morning like there at Bay Route. Awesome. You know, and all I wanted to
[00:37:39] do is go to Iraq. And so then after like two months of just staring at Bay Route, we went back
[00:37:45] across the Suez. Got into Kuwait. And they ended up saying, you don't have the legs for the deployment.
[00:37:51] Because when you put people on a deployment, there's like, yes, cut off. And to extend that would have
[00:37:56] caused more trouble than it was worth. They did take our sniper opportunity out of that
[00:38:00] batai and sent them up north because it was six. It was such a sniper fight. And we actually had
[00:38:05] unfortunately a couple snipers over kill. So we ended up coming back from the deployment and had
[00:38:09] a memorial for these snipers. And it was so weird because most of us hadn't even gotten into Iraq.
[00:38:14] And then we're at this memorial. But that was, that was the first deployment.
[00:38:20] And then you serve then you roll right into another workup. That's right. So I mean, we went.
[00:38:25] So we got back in December. And we deployed to Ramani Bay September. So like six, seven months later.
[00:38:32] And this is kind of, this is a longer story. So I'm going all of it. But I haven't
[00:38:37] going to go to Winter Mountain Leaders course from January to March. And then I got back. We went to
[00:38:43] Fort Pickett Hall of April. So I mean, I was only home. And then we ended up going to Mojaveviper.
[00:38:49] It was what it was called back then, which was a two month deal. I mean, I was only home probably
[00:38:54] for about six weeks. And I and I my wife quit her job to come down and live with me in between that.
[00:39:00] And so we had bought a house. And it was like, yeah, I guess I'll see you after the next deployment.
[00:39:04] Because I am just not home, right? And so I'll skip forward the reason I didn't get out after the
[00:39:09] second deployment. It's just that she quit her job and had came down. And then when I was in
[00:39:15] Iraq and all of just worn out, and she's like, what are you going to do? I said, I'm going to get out.
[00:39:19] Like, that's a punch. Like, well, what's the plan after them? I don't know. We'll figure that out.
[00:39:22] She's like, we just bought a house. Please take a non-depoiable. So we can free this out. But
[00:39:28] so yeah, personal life was, was tough at that time. So when you came home from that deployment,
[00:39:34] where you went to Lebanon, you get back from that. And you immediately go into work up. But on top of
[00:39:39] the work up, you go to mountain leader school. You're just gone the whole time. Your wife, who had
[00:39:44] cleared jobs. Now sitting in the house filled with boxes that you never unpacked because you're a bad
[00:39:49] husband. I'm promised I would paint the house. I'd have painted this. I've done this drill before.
[00:39:55] I've definitely done that drill before. I moved to Virginia Beach. And I was there for two years.
[00:40:00] And in that time, I did two deployments and to work up. So my wife, we never even took some stuff out of
[00:40:06] the boxes in the house that we bought. So yeah, I did that drill. The bathroom never got painted.
[00:40:12] Neither did anything else until until when until we're getting ready to sell the house.
[00:40:15] Then I got a bunch of stuff done. I can beat that. I've done moved to move where the stuff was
[00:40:20] still in the boxes from the last move. And the movers are like, well, we need you to take it out of the
[00:40:25] boxes because we can't use other people's boxes. I'm like, you want me to take all my stuff out of the
[00:40:28] boxes for you to put in new boxes. So yeah, I bet that. There's a mountain leaders course up at
[00:40:33] Bridgeport. It is. Yeah. And how was that? It was awesome. So I didn't want to go just because my wife
[00:40:37] had quit a job and came down and that had limited time. And it was this whole thing where I put my
[00:40:43] name in the hat because I didn't know my wife was quitting. So on the first deployment of my
[00:40:46] name in the hat, when I came back, they're like, you're not going. And then at the last second,
[00:40:50] like, after my wife quit, and I probably should have moved all our stuff out. They're like, okay,
[00:40:54] you're going. I'm like, what? You know, I was like flipping tables. How long is that course?
[00:40:57] It was three months. And so it is very challenging because it's so cold.
[00:41:03] Some mentally, it really takes a toll. But I have a good skier. I grew up skiing and ski resorts
[00:41:08] around the Midwest. And so that was fun. And back then, they probably don't do this anymore.
[00:41:12] Back then, for weekends, they gave us a 16 passenger van and let us as the students have it.
[00:41:17] So we had a gunny who didn't drink. And he just drove us to Tahoe or, you know, every week.
[00:41:22] I mean, it was some of the fun of the weekend that I've ever had. The last time I came to San Diego,
[00:41:26] was on that bridge portrait. So me and my buddy took a flight to San Diego. And I had a guy who had
[00:41:32] an apartment in the gas lamp district in, uh, maybe a good time. Yeah. And then you're, you go into
[00:41:38] employment. And now you're working up. You do you know you're going to Iraq this time? Yeah,
[00:41:41] we do. I know you're going straight to Iraq out, taking a ship. That's right.
[00:41:45] And, but this is now 2007. But your work up is in 2006.
[00:41:51] Uh, no, the work up, the work up was January to July of 2007. Okay. But still, do you know where
[00:41:58] you're going? Do you know you're going to Ramadi the whole time? Yes. And so at that time,
[00:42:02] still 2007, you started to work up. Ramadi is still pretty freaking hot at that point.
[00:42:06] Ramadi was very hot in January, 2007. And then there was a thing called the L. Ambar Awakening.
[00:42:13] And so it was almost like the sharp pivot like right as we were getting there. And so the unit that we
[00:42:18] ripped with two five, I mean, they had just, it was like gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, and then
[00:42:24] it will last two months of their deployment. And almost like somebody just hit stop. And so it
[00:42:29] created a lot of weirdness for us because it was like, we were still operating under TTPs where
[00:42:34] it was like gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, gunfight, and it just, it really wasn't that by the time
[00:42:38] we showed up. So where were you? Where in Ramadi were you? So I was a company XO now. And we,
[00:42:44] I was on the south west corner, I started a place called JSS Iron. And we had like two
[00:42:55] platoon outposts. So as a company XO, I was consolidating the patrol rosters and like the
[00:43:00] name of the game then was always have patrols in the battle space. Like, what are we doing?
[00:43:04] I just get them out there, right? So it was just like just saturate the battle space with presence.
[00:43:09] And so as XO, a lot of my role was just making sure that we had good perimeter security of our
[00:43:15] positions, that we had all our gear and that the operational plan, I was like the
[00:43:19] absolute, if you will, at the company level. And then about three months into the deployment,
[00:43:26] they moved us because we were at that time trying to move out of the city to further outpost
[00:43:31] to allow the Iraqi police to have more control. And so we basically built a fob in the ground up,
[00:43:38] it was called JSS Sua. And this was all the way in the southwest out of the city now.
[00:43:44] And it was called Sua because it was literally, I think, built by a sewer. And there was nothing
[00:43:49] there. And you know, even though we had been in Iraq since what O3, it was like we had never been
[00:43:55] in our Iraq before. So it was like baby web showers, no childhood. I mean it was awful. It was bad.
[00:44:00] And so we did that. We finished the deployment there.
[00:44:03] And what was the, I know things had settled down a lot when you had patrols out in the city,
[00:44:09] were they taking any contact? Or was it? Yeah, we had one pull to and they got in some context.
[00:44:13] Did the, the problem then, it was almost, I don't know, I don't want to say more dangerous,
[00:44:18] but it was like you'd get lald into a false sense of stability. And then there'd be a suicide
[00:44:25] best attack. And you lose guys. And so my best friend, so I did the first deployment in
[00:44:31] Bravo Company. I was a particular commander. So when we got back, I was still a particular
[00:44:35] and Bravo Company. They moved me over to Alpha Company to be the XO. So I still had a lot of good
[00:44:39] friends that were particular commanders in Bravo Company. One of them, it's guys' name was Dave
[00:44:42] Warden. He used to, we used to make dinner. He was a Pittsburgh dealer's fan. I was a Bengals fan.
[00:44:47] So we'd always have like rivalry games together with my wife. And he responded to a sniper threat.
[00:44:55] And Sua's side best came up to him, guy wearing Sua's side best, and detonated it and killed
[00:45:00] one of his Marines in Blue David, lost his leg. And so there's just an example of, you know,
[00:45:06] I'm sitting there for two months with like nothing happening. And then I got to listen on the
[00:45:10] radio to my buddy being evacuated out lost a Marine. And then, and so yeah, so we had one pollton
[00:45:19] that all got combat action ribbons from doing patrols and getting into fire fights, but they didn't
[00:45:24] really kill a lot of people. It was more, that deployment was more just about like census patrols
[00:45:30] stability, building shit, and trying not to get blown up. I mean, there was a, there was the adjacent
[00:45:37] batayan. I might get the units wrong. I hope I don't, I think it was 28 and one nine. And they were
[00:45:42] doing the rib towards end of our deployment. And this is still a story told in the Marine Corps
[00:45:47] while they were sitting at the ECP, a huge, so there's like two companies in there because they were
[00:45:51] doing the rib, a huge dump truck blew through the ECP with a bunch of explosives. And all of the
[00:45:57] Iraqis ran in these two young Marines, Stan of the ECP from different units, didn't know each other,
[00:46:01] stood there and killed the driver and got themselves killed. And all the Iraqis were talking
[00:46:07] about how brave the Marines were. And then we, we almost believed that they were probably
[00:46:12] exaggerating that a little bit. And then after this huge explosion, one of the cameras, even though
[00:46:17] it looked like it was broken, still had the footage. And then went back and pulled the footage.
[00:46:20] And it was exactly like they said, these two young Marines, Stan of the ECP, knowing they were
[00:46:25] going to die, not knowing each other. Like in that instant realized what was happening,
[00:46:29] saved everybody else on that base. So like that to me, that story almost describes what
[00:46:33] Romadi was when I was there. Like you can be standing on that ECP for seven months without a single
[00:46:39] thing. And then all of a sudden in a second, there's a dump truck flying at you and you know
[00:46:43] you're about to die. And so for me, the ECP, so I was always, it was like, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:46:53] I was like 20 hour work days constantly. And you know, you go back and you're asking
[00:46:58] why were you working 20 hour work days? Like, I can't put my finger on exactly what it was.
[00:47:03] It just seemed like there was always something that required like a meaty detention. And the
[00:47:07] ISO container that I lived in was with my company commander and our one-trip. So it seemed like
[00:47:12] people were waking us up. Like somebody always needed one of the three of us. That was the
[00:47:16] stupidest move in hindsight, putting us three in the same sleeping facility. Like it was so dumb.
[00:47:21] And so like when I came home from Romadi, I mean I started having chest pains, like real chest
[00:47:29] physical chest pains. And I it took me a lot of kind of figure out that it was anxiety. And then I
[00:47:33] didn't experience anxiety during the deployments. Like when you're working 20 hour days and
[00:47:37] years ago go go and hit me like once I tried to chill out. But I tell that just to say,
[00:47:44] I think I kind of was going so fast that it just kind of freed some of the wires my brain there
[00:47:48] for a little bit and took some while to work through some of that. So you get home, you get home
[00:47:55] from that deployment and then what's next? Yeah, so I had to get forward the earlier. So I had
[00:48:02] planned on getting out. I didn't get along with my batained commander on that deployment. He was very
[00:48:08] dictator-ish almost like verbally mentally abusive. I just didn't care for him. I didn't,
[00:48:14] I don't know if I even agreed with the mission of Romadi. Like I said, I joined because I wanted to
[00:48:18] be in combat. But I found myself as my company commander would write the contracts. And as the
[00:48:23] exo, I was what was known as the pageant. I go to camp Romadi and they'd filled my book bag
[00:48:28] with like $200,000 cash and then run around and just give it to like these mafia figures.
[00:48:33] And I'm just thinking like, is this what we're doing? Like this just, I don't know if this counter
[00:48:39] insurgency. Oh, this is what we're doing. I don't know if this counter insurgency, like because
[00:48:44] all the generals are talking about like how great it is. But like even as a young tenant, like I had a lot of
[00:48:47] questions. I was like, that was that was influential to me because I'm thinking like there's got to be a
[00:48:52] more effective way. Like these guys that I'm giving them money to right now. I don't know if anyone
[00:48:56] else sees this. But this guy is not going to build stability here. And I rack this guy's going to
[00:48:59] take it. And he might even make it worse for the local Iraqi. And so anyway, I left. I would thought
[00:49:06] about getting out, but my wife's very much wanted some stability. I thought like she deserved it.
[00:49:12] And so instead of getting out, I took school of infantry as a company commander. It was in North
[00:49:17] Carolina. I didn't have to move and the goal was to do three years there and find get to get a master's
[00:49:23] getting an MBA and then go on the next thing. And when I got to the school of infantry,
[00:49:28] I was very busy. I was go go go go. School of infantry is funny because right then it was Iraq
[00:49:33] and all my instructors were Iraq veterans and all their families are willing to put their
[00:49:40] problems on the shelf when you're at war. But it's like they had an expectation for their husband
[00:49:45] when he got home that they would address some of those problems. And then those point structures
[00:49:49] were working dark to dark and it was like every single one of them were going through a divorce. Like
[00:49:55] up to like my senior and list of like every single one like I was bringing in chaplains. I was
[00:49:59] bringing in workshops. And so the biggest struggle there was just the personalized of my guys. They all
[00:50:03] had drinking problems. They all had marriage problems. They were all working through their own
[00:50:07] demons and then trying to teach 300 privates how to be infantry men without losing their cool,
[00:50:13] you know, not flying off the handle. And so that was kind of a more emotionally draining than I thought
[00:50:19] it would be. And I did it for about a year and a half until I write it about then it was.
[00:50:26] So I was at SOS from O8 to 10. If you go back and look at the news around O809,
[00:50:32] the common of the Marine Corps, guy named Conway was saying he wanted to get the Marine
[00:50:35] Corps out of Iraq and into Afghanistan. So I was right when they were trying to do the pivot and I
[00:50:39] thought, hey, you know, my Ramadi deployment and it wasn't the combat that I thought it was going to be.
[00:50:44] It was very emotionally draining but it was, you know, I wasn't shooting a gun all the time. So I was like,
[00:50:50] I would love to get an Afghanistan and then maybe get out and just have that experience.
[00:50:55] And so I contacted my monitor and I found a deployment through an organization called joint
[00:51:00] IED defeat organization, Jai Doe. And they see he's like, there's a joint requirement for an
[00:51:05] infantry captain. He's like, this is perfect. It'll get you there. You'll get every all the combat
[00:51:09] experience that you want. And all you need is two years of SOS, not three. So after two, I can
[00:51:14] cut your orders if you get your commands endorsement. We can make this happen. So I went and
[00:51:18] talked to my boss and my boss didn't want me to do it. He was very reluctant. He wanted me to be the
[00:51:24] officer or the H&I company commander, which is like the senior builder. So they're like, he liked me.
[00:51:28] Were you instructing at all? Were you at the SOS? Or were you more just like, overall
[00:51:34] in management position? Yeah. So you get 300 privates. So SOS is in two camps. So there's MCT and
[00:51:43] ITB. So all marine and list of marines that are not infantry go to MCT. And they get, it's evolving
[00:51:49] now with the new force. But back then they got like two weeks of infantry training. And ITB
[00:51:55] you got one month. So it was essentially like your follow-in-school. So the guys at MCT, if you're
[00:51:59] going to go be a motor T driver, you'd MCT for two weeks and then you go to a motor T school.
[00:52:04] ITB, they just get longer training than their infantry marines and then they go onto their
[00:52:07] follow-in unit. And so again, it's changing now. I think it's up to like 10 weeks for ITB. But back then
[00:52:13] it was only four weeks. And so that's outstanding. Yeah, it is. It really is. And so they got,
[00:52:21] so we would get 300 privates. And we would divide them into four platoons. The platoon commanders were
[00:52:25] either staff sergeants or sergeants. And then each platoon commander had two or three instructors.
[00:52:30] So you never had more than three to four for, I don't know, do the math, like 75 guys. So it's a lot.
[00:52:37] The instructor student ratio was not good. And there was no other officers. I had a first
[00:52:41] sergeant in a gunning and then there was the young captain. And that was the staff.
[00:52:46] So you're not doing a lot of instruction. You're not seeing a lot of what's going on.
[00:52:51] There were most of the instruction comes from, they have a separate cadre of instructors at the
[00:52:57] instructor group. So it's almost like the staff that you have is almost like facilitating in the
[00:53:02] after hours and the watching and the day to day leadership. Now there's still a lot of classes
[00:53:07] that we give out in the field or or once they get back to the house. And sometimes there's even
[00:53:10] like scheduled platform instruction. But most of the platform instruction comes from general
[00:53:14] support instructors. So the question was how much classes did I give? There were probably two or three
[00:53:19] program company commander classes. And the rest was just in prompt to hey, you're going on
[00:53:24] liberty this weekend under a committee commander. No control. No control. I was very lucky in my career.
[00:53:30] I wasn't instructor, which is a strong word to use when back in the day, back in the day we used
[00:53:37] to that's heel team. There was just instruct. There was there was training inside each heel team.
[00:53:43] So like as an E5, I was teaching a bunch of stuff and it really put me in a great position because
[00:53:48] in you're you're having to learn it better and then you're teaching it and then you're seeing
[00:53:51] how it works and seeing the mistakes that people made. So I've always felt like I learned a
[00:53:55] ton doing that and then later in my career when I was running training, which was our training
[00:54:02] was just freaking out standing. And but I got to again watch, observe, teach and I learned so much
[00:54:10] when I was in those positions. And that's what I wanted if you were, you know, kind of actively teaching
[00:54:15] and what you got out of that. You're 100% right. The people that learn the most are the teachers.
[00:54:22] And because you can't fake the funk when you're the teacher and you have to there's, you know,
[00:54:26] five, six, seven hours of prep for anyone hour of instruction that you get at a minimum. And so I
[00:54:31] 100% of the grab work at a bunch of former school houses and we learn that abundantly. The people that
[00:54:36] teach are really the ones that learn in my opinion. Yeah, I think I learned 70% of what I ever learned
[00:54:44] in my life while I was in E5 instructor, cadre at COT 1. Yeah, because I taught, that's the
[00:54:51] other thing I was like a young single guy. So it was what trip am I going on? All of them. Going to teach
[00:54:56] diving. Going to teach in my warfare. Going to teach CQC. Mount Epigore to teach and everything.
[00:55:01] And spec recon cool. I'm going on the spec recon trip. So really just got to teach everything.
[00:55:06] And then you could watch and your de facto detach from what's happening. So you're watching.
[00:55:10] We used to teach the new guys that came to seal team one. We would put them through their
[00:55:16] initial course of training. So then I'm watching the young officers. And I was just, I was an
[00:55:20] enlisted guy, but now watching these young officers and seeing like, oh, this guy is getting totally,
[00:55:25] he's been spending all this time shooting his weapon. So no one's making any calls. I never
[00:55:28] were going to do that. I'm never going to make that mistake. And this guy over here is imposing his
[00:55:32] plan on the rest of his squad. So they're all pissed at him. I'm not going to make that mistake. So I
[00:55:36] got to learn like I said, I might even be more than 70% from just being a young,
[00:55:42] E5 teaching at CLT1. And then also you had these senior guys that were super knowledgeable and
[00:55:50] they're teaching you. That's just freaking a good way to learn. But then you get picked up for this
[00:55:57] giant O billet. Yep. Yeah, so the giant O billet was awesome. I mean, it was awesome. So I had no training.
[00:56:07] So I mean, you have heard my story about my training in terms of IEDs. So an EOD guy goes to school
[00:56:12] for 69 months depending on what branch of service and what they did was they put me in Crystal
[00:56:18] City, you know, Hilton Lobby, Comfort Truman, and then like had a fake name for the conference,
[00:56:23] shut in lock the doors and they had some like old IED maker. And he gave us like a crash course on how
[00:56:28] to make a circuit essentially. And then how the explosives work. And so we did that for three days.
[00:56:33] And then they shipped me down range. And that was that. I mean, it was crazy. When you think about it.
[00:56:39] And I ended up then you were the IED expert. Then I was the one I just heard. I don't think they ever
[00:56:44] expected me to be the IED expert. They wanted EOD as obviously the IED expert. But what the billet was
[00:56:50] supposed to do was be the infantry interface to have enough knowledge of IEDs but to think like
[00:56:57] employment of infantry stuff and connect the route clearance button and the EOD and then be able
[00:57:04] to translate that into whatever is important to the batang commander. So you get your three A.S. schools
[00:57:12] and then you deploy right to Afghanistan. That's right. Yep. How was your life on this whole scenario?
[00:57:18] My wife. I stoked was she. So did. Yeah. So we got. Because she's like oh you're home.
[00:57:27] Oh, sure. You kind of have a normal job. I get almost like a night. Then I got her pregnant.
[00:57:32] So she was three months pregnant and then I went to Afghanistan. Right. I'll tell a story
[00:57:38] because it just kind of illustrates the stress on a military family. So we were going
[00:57:41] crib shopping. She knows I'm going to Afghanistan. Again, I was we knew I was deploying when she was
[00:57:47] three months. So we're going crib shopping and we were going to like this is like the third store.
[00:57:51] Like I hate shopping. So we're going to like the third store and I see a crib. I'm like this one.
[00:57:55] I went this one. Let's get this one. She's like I want to keep looking around and I'm like well
[00:57:59] I'm just going to stand here by this crib that I like and you can keep walking around and I'll
[00:58:03] be right here and then she just broke down crying and it had nothing. Was this the first baby?
[00:58:08] Yeah. Was this the first girl's kid? This is a bad tackle.
[00:58:11] I know. Well, that's one tell a story. Like it was my mistake. People can learn from it. That's
[00:58:16] right. Better go walk around. Look at some great grips. I know. I know. And so that's what she's
[00:58:22] she's as she's crying. She's like you can look around. Come back when you're ready. I got it.
[00:58:28] I got it. Is it building relationships? She's talking about it.
[00:58:33] So bad move on my part. So then we I had to usher out. She's crying. I felt bad. We got in the car.
[00:58:41] We drove home and it was like one of those really awkward and tense situations. We had to buy
[00:58:45] the crib online because we couldn't bring ourselves a look for a crib again. And then I deployed.
[00:58:51] So I tell that story just to say, you know, I really wanted to go to Afghanistan. But it comes.
[00:58:57] These things come out of cost, right? So I got pregnant wife who's trying to be very supportive.
[00:59:01] She was a supportive of me staying. She was even supportive of me going to Afghanistan.
[00:59:05] But it doesn't mean that it doesn't come with some type of personal cost.
[00:59:10] So she's three months pregnant when you leave for Afghanistan. How long is the deployment
[00:59:14] to Afghanistan? Oh, you're. And did you come home for the birth of your kid?
[00:59:18] I, so you get when it's a year you get. It's already too long. But answer it.
[00:59:23] You get two weeks. But I missed I missed the birth. But I was able to come home like
[00:59:29] right as she like four days after the birth. So right after she got out of the hospital. So I
[00:59:32] did get two weeks with them. But I mean, I haven't two weeks with the baby after you've been in
[00:59:37] just combat every day for six months knowing you're going back to that same place for another six
[00:59:43] months. It was real hard to establish any emotional connection because like, I mean, that's just,
[00:59:50] it was, I would almost have rather not gone home and be honest with you because it, like you're,
[00:59:54] when you're with them, your mind's there, when you're there, your mind's with them. And so
[00:59:59] yeah, in some ways it was good. But other ways it was, it was very hard.
[01:00:04] So you go on deployment. Who are you, who you with? So I got two. It's like a solo operation.
[01:00:10] That's right. It was just a studio diverse solo. I got through Bogram Airbus and that's where
[01:00:17] Gita's task force was that. So they called a test force pilot in the Afghanistan.
[01:00:21] So they got the task force pilot in headquarters and they decided it's, because most Marines are
[01:00:26] familiar with Southwest, Helmond, and Candahar. But they didn't send me there. They sent me to RC East
[01:00:32] to support the 101st Army Division. And so I got out, the first unit I got to was a
[01:00:38] Italian called 3187 and they were in East Pactica Province. And the Favrega tattoo was organ.
[01:00:45] And their company, Favre's were also dispersed that any time we had to take them logistics,
[01:00:52] it was like a one day road trip throughout Clarence, Petune and EOD. And any time there was an EOD
[01:00:58] response. We had to fly out on the fly line. And I was just, I say that just to say it was very
[01:01:02] distributed. And like most people or Marines, picture of Afghanistan and it's just like desert,
[01:01:07] wasteland. It was like the Rocky Mountains where I was at. I mean it was not what I was expecting.
[01:01:13] And I got out there and I was like, this is, this is not the desert. And so you could see Pakistan
[01:01:17] from where we were at. It was just, it was a cowboy country. And then what were you doing?
[01:01:23] Well, I guess explain a little bit more detail. So you get, there's a logistics supply that needs
[01:01:28] to go to some outstation. I'll illustrate with one war story from that time frame.
[01:01:33] So one of the company Favre's hadn't been resupplied in a while. And so they planned this,
[01:01:40] because in the, to a lot of August it was raining a lot. And so when it rains, the aircraft couldn't
[01:01:45] fly, the logistical supplies. And just because they, with all these jingle trucks, it was easier
[01:01:51] to move logistics. So we took this huge patrol. So I went with EOD and wrapped Clarence Patrol
[01:01:57] and all these logistics trucks out to this company Favre and dropped it off. And then when we got there,
[01:02:01] they said, hey, we've got this platoon outpost over here on the border near Pakistan that just
[01:02:07] hasn't had whatever in so many days. Like, we really need you guys to push this stuff out here. We,
[01:02:11] we here at the company Favre don't have the assets. If you call back to the time and they're like,
[01:02:15] yeah, if you can, that would be great. So we do. So next day, then we go from this company Favre
[01:02:20] out to the platoon Favre. But we left it like A-D-M. So how many vehicles are you bringing with you?
[01:02:24] So you got the disaroff estimate. Rob Clarence Patrol soon is probably a dozen. You got the EOD truck
[01:02:30] in there. You've got, are you guys an M-Rapz? What are you in? What are you in?
[01:02:34] Yeah, it's J-Rapz. J-Rapz and J-L-T-Vs mix. But they also had a lot of logistics trucks. We're
[01:02:41] jingled trucks. You know, that is like a Afghani flatbed. And then you've got the Afghan National
[01:02:46] Security Force. So they're all in their F-150 pickup trucks. And then you got probably an infantry
[01:02:51] platoon or company for extra security that maybe in just homevies. And so it's this. So this is a big
[01:02:57] comery. Long collection of different players. And so we drive through to get to these things on
[01:03:04] the border. There's not roads. You're driving through like the creek beds of the mountain crevices.
[01:03:11] And we get to there and like, let's call it one or two o'clock in the afternoon. So there's
[01:03:16] 15 vehicles, 20 vehicles? I'd say like 40. 40 vehicles to go out and resupply up all the tune.
[01:03:23] Yes. Which, by the way, has 40 guys. Yes. So this is like already you can see what this is like crazy
[01:03:31] shit going on. Yes. Okay. So 40. So a 40 vehicle convoy with every type of vehicles, madmax
[01:03:39] is driving out to resupply 40 dudes that are out on the edge of the world. They were on the edge
[01:03:46] of the world, yes. And so it's maybe like two o'clock when we come out of the creek bed. And
[01:03:52] this is relevant to the story. When we came out of the creek bed there was like five afghanies
[01:03:55] sitting there with like their arms crossed, staring at us and we're like, let's look at these in the
[01:03:59] various characters. Like, one of these guys going to do, and nothing happened. And we were all kind of
[01:04:04] item and that's relevant later. So we go into the top. We drop all this applies off. It's like three
[01:04:09] clock. And the call is made like, what do we do? It's three clock. I mean, it took us like do the
[01:04:14] math eight to three to get here. Do we want to go back or do we get sleep here tonight? And again,
[01:04:19] 40 vehicles, like the civil pull tune outposts were like, so probably a bad call. I mean, the
[01:04:24] hindsight 2020 obviously is a bad call. But at the time it just made sense of like, let's just go,
[01:04:28] like, you know, get back late. It will be alright. So when we start driving back, now we're going
[01:04:33] back into that creek bed where those guys are now it's nighttime. No, it's like three clock.
[01:04:36] Okay. When we leave, it gets dark soon. So we're going back in this creek bed and where those guys
[01:04:43] were standing, they had piled a bunch of rocks up to the the creek bed. Well, obviously this is
[01:04:49] going to be an ambush. These guys piled a bunch of rocks as a marking mechanism or as a blocking
[01:04:55] mechanism. Great question. Okay. Check. You know what I mean? So we didn't ask that very intelligent
[01:05:01] question. We just immediately assumed ambush because that that had happened to us before. So we're
[01:05:06] like, all right, these guys are going to ambush us. So you sit there, you got your eyes up and
[01:05:09] you're looking around. Nothing happened. And then it's just like, all right, well let them trigger
[01:05:13] the ambush. I were going to go through it and we went through it and nothing happened. And then we just
[01:05:16] didn't think through anything else and we just started going. So we get now it's dark. It's probably
[01:05:25] eight o'clock. Are the Afghans? Are you on night vision? Because I know you're on night. But what
[01:05:31] the Afghans do? The Django trucks are on night vision. I can't remember. They were so far back
[01:05:38] that if their lights were on, I didn't see it. Yeah. I can't remember. It's a good question. I don't
[01:05:44] remember. So we were, it's now like eight or nine o'clock. It's dark and started raining. And I can't,
[01:05:51] it's hard to describe. It's almost as if somebody had broken a dam because it wasn't like the
[01:05:56] creek bed started slowly filling up. It was almost like a wave came down and hit the tires.
[01:06:01] This is like flash floods in area of eye desert. And so, but it's still only at the tires and
[01:06:07] the m-raps in the jail TVs go through it's still pretty easily. But then we get the call on the radio
[01:06:11] that one of the Django trucks had gotten stuck. You know, I can't even see it. It's so far back. So I'm like,
[01:06:16] all right. And your job in all this is like an observer or you're not in charge of anything.
[01:06:21] I'm not in charge of anything. But it's weird because I outrank the boat. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:26] You know what I mean? Yeah. So you've kind of orange, George. Right. You're in charge. In a way, yes.
[01:06:32] Right. And so we stop. We're waiting for the Django truck to un-mess itself. And then all of a sudden it was like
[01:06:40] another dam broke. And then the water hit right to our grill. It's like almost immediately. And now it's a
[01:06:45] situation where you can't just get out of the car. And so we, a little backstory, we had killed
[01:06:54] Taliban members and taken their icons. And then we keep this is on the same operation. This is on
[01:06:59] previous one. Okay. So I'm telling the story. So to the understand, we kept the icons in the patrol
[01:07:05] and we put it on scan. And when the Taliban started talking, we'd catch it on the scan. Then we'd
[01:07:10] hand it to the turp, the turp, and interpret it. And then we'd pass over the radio, whatever it was being said.
[01:07:15] So when we were in the flash flood, now we're like worrying about the water. It comes across the
[01:07:21] radio. Like, hey, the Taliban sees that we're stuck in the water and they're maneuvering to ambush on us.
[01:07:26] Okay. Yeah. So now you're now you're in a situation where it's like, all right,
[01:07:32] what's your poison? Like, because the machine guns are all hooked up to the trucks.
[01:07:36] But at a certain point, you might drown if you stay with the truck. You might drown just trying to get to the
[01:07:42] shore. So it's like, what do you do? Well, we all got up on the roofs of our trucks. And the water
[01:07:48] kept coming up. And finally, I was like, I, I, I'm going to die from drowning before I die,
[01:07:53] getting shot with the, with the Taliban. So I'm going to take my chances. So I, I slung my weapon.
[01:07:58] And I, I was the first one to jump in. I jumped in. I swam ashore. Current was ripened, but I'm a pretty
[01:08:03] good swimmer. I got over there. And then I started making rope bridges. So I tied some rope up to a tree
[01:08:08] through it to the truck. And then we started having guys shimmy in from the trucks over to the shore.
[01:08:13] And so then we passed this down. All the trucks start doing it. Well, what happened was one of the
[01:08:17] soldiers in the back got on a rope bridge. And when he put the weight of him, when he got in the water,
[01:08:24] he panicked and he let go. And he didn't like clip in or anything. And so he rips down river. So then the
[01:08:29] call comes on the radio. Hey, we lost a soldier. He's, he's done. He's gone. This is an half dance
[01:08:35] soldier on my sermon. No, it's an American. It's an American soldier. Yep. And the afghate. So he
[01:08:40] when he floats down river, one of the ANSF, the ANSF, same to the afghate national security
[01:08:45] forces. And so they all start talking about how they saw him. And he basically, from our last vehicle,
[01:08:50] they spot him, float by him. So we know he's still ripping down the river. Right? So now you're in a
[01:08:56] situation where people are starting to get in off the trucks. We know the towel bands moving
[01:08:59] and we're just lost the sky down the river. And it's like, this is getting messy real quick.
[01:09:03] This is a little beyond getting mess. Yeah. And so we try to call in air support.
[01:09:09] You know, good to go to God going down the river, all this stuff. And they deny it because it's raining.
[01:09:13] And it's red air. And so they say, no. So I grab a bunch of guys and I'm like,
[01:09:19] clon, follow me. We're going to go do a patrol. We're going to try and find this guy.
[01:09:23] And it's it's weird because I'm not really my guys. So I got to like play diplomat. You
[01:09:27] like, can I have some of your guys to go do this? But I had good relationships. So I was able to do that.
[01:09:32] And then it gets even weirder. So then the Taliban passed over their radio that they had
[01:09:39] captured the American soldier. So we got we picked up a chatter that the Taliban has the American
[01:09:45] soldier. And so then we're all like, man, we got it. The acronym was Dust One. So we got a Dust One
[01:09:50] situation. So we call that over the radio. And previously they said they wouldn't send aircraft.
[01:09:54] But this time now that because we're right there on the border Pakistan, when the Taliban
[01:09:58] confirmed that they have one of our men, they're like, we're sending an airport. So they send this
[01:10:02] section of the patchies like immediately. And it was awesome. I mean, it was a female section
[01:10:08] Lee. And I was listening to her on the radio. And she must have killed like 20 dudes. And she was just
[01:10:12] like stoic. Like killed five secondary explosion RPG. He's dead. And like we were just watching her.
[01:10:19] Just like sweet this hillside, just laying waste. And I was just fast forward to end of this story.
[01:10:26] What happened was the soldier we ended up finding him the next morning. He washed down river. He
[01:10:32] drowned. And we ended up actually having, we thought he would have been rigged with explosives. And so my
[01:10:39] year D tech put his bombs and walked up to him in the river and cut him down and many
[01:10:43] footed down river actually caught him and pulled him out. And I don't know if you're ever seen
[01:10:47] him in this drown, but like their stomach expands and they get all these veins. And what had happened
[01:10:52] was the Taliban, even though we were listening to them, they were monitoring the ANSF radios.
[01:10:59] And when the ANSF saw the soldier float by, they got on their radios. The Taliban heard that.
[01:11:07] And then they pat knowing that we were listening to them passed misinformation to get into our
[01:11:13] loop. But you know, when I when our flight back on it, them doing that triggered the
[01:11:18] apachees, which ultimately killed all of them. So it's just one of those situations that I mean.
[01:11:24] So you asked me like, what did we do? Like, there's a story of like, you know, you leave that and
[01:11:29] it was what we were doing a resupply for a普通 fob. And you just walk away from like that was
[01:11:34] just a lot to unpack right there. So did the water eventually received and the vehicles were able to
[01:11:39] drive after that? The next morning they went down and we were able to get all the vehicles out because we
[01:11:44] brought from external sources, some records to help us pull stuff out. But they made us go up and
[01:11:50] down the river looking for the soldiers rifle and MVGs, which we weren't going to find. But we spent
[01:11:56] probably until lunchtime the next day just walking through the water acting like we were going to find
[01:12:01] that. And finally somebody made the decision to stop and then we got back on our trucks and left.
[01:12:07] And what's the uptempo like for you? So that's one mission that takes two days, three days.
[01:12:13] What are you doing after that? So, you know, then you go back to the company fob. Maybe spend
[01:12:17] a day reset and then you drive back to the batayan fob. And then I involved myself in the batayan
[01:12:22] battle rhythm, the meetings. I continued offered advice, but every time we're back at the batayan fob,
[01:12:27] anywhere in the batayan battle space where an IED is found in my EOD text fly out there I would go with them.
[01:12:34] I mean, I could just keep going for stories all day. But we, here's an example and that same space.
[01:12:40] There was a helicopter that was flying a ISO container of machine guns out to one of the outposts
[01:12:46] and it pickled it, which means it, I don't know what happened, but they decided to drop the
[01:12:50] ISO container of the middle mountains. So like, hey, we need you to go up there, check it out.
[01:12:54] We want to send you OD because there might be explosives in it. So we fly up there, we get to the
[01:12:58] thing, see if we can re-sling load it, we can't. So we're just going to blow it up, they're like,
[01:13:02] no, you can't blow it up, it's got machine gun and stuff. And like, well, it's all burnt.
[01:13:05] They're like, it doesn't matter, you got to carry it out. So I was literally carrying like 250
[01:13:09] caliber severs, like through the mountains and there was all unusable, but they didn't want to leave it there.
[01:13:15] And we were supposed to fly out that night. So I didn't bring, this is such a stupid move. I didn't
[01:13:20] bring like warming layers or things for the next day. And of course, because it took us so long
[01:13:26] carry all that stuff, then it got dark and then the aircraft didn't want to land in the mountains.
[01:13:30] So we just spend the night up there and I, I almost froze to death. I remember the only thing we had
[01:13:35] was a body bag and I slept in the body bag, spooning another man so that I wouldn't freeze it
[01:13:41] that. I mean, talk about in your head when you're like in the body bag, right?
[01:13:47] Yeah, as you're doing these operations, what do you, what do you, you mentioned that earlier
[01:13:53] when you're in your body and you're handing out hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:13:57] to various people? And you're starting to think from a strategic perspective, this doesn't seem
[01:14:03] like maybe the greatest idea in the world. When you got 40 vehicles going out to resupply, 40 soldiers
[01:14:10] out in an outstation somewhere and the risks involved, then now you lose a soldier which is
[01:14:16] freakin horrible. And now you're going to a mountain top to recover, destroy weapons because
[01:14:24] you're not allowed to blow them in place. What is your, what are your thoughts of this? Now you're
[01:14:29] how long you've been in for at this point? You're, yeah, so that was 11, so 7, 6, 7 years.
[01:14:34] So, so you've got a little bit more maturity as a, as a human and as a military officer. Are
[01:14:41] you starting to wonder what the hell's going on? Absolutely, I mean, you're just, I'm really
[01:14:45] good points right there. I think what ate me the most when I took that 40 vehicles to that 40
[01:14:50] manpatoon, I could see Pakistan. I could see their bases. I could see where they shot mortars
[01:14:56] at us from and we couldn't do anything. So, when you talk about strategic problems, like does
[01:15:02] America really want to win this war? Like, I can see the fucking home base right over there. Like,
[01:15:07] why can't I go over there and kill them? And so, I mean, when I look back at the Afghan war,
[01:15:12] my king read my brain around that, if I was going to put service members, lives at risk,
[01:15:17] I'm going to do whatever it takes to win the war. Or I'm not going to be there. But there was just
[01:15:22] a ton of things that we didn't do from a foreign policy standpoint to allow the service members to win
[01:15:27] the war. It's criminal almost. And so, yes, standing there at the border of Pakistan, I remember
[01:15:32] looking at their home bases and just taking this crazy. And then how long this deployment is a one-year
[01:15:38] deployment? Yeah. And in the middle of it, you go home. You missed the birth of your son, my first son.
[01:15:43] First son, but you show up what two three days, but after he's born. That's right. And now you're
[01:15:48] going through this transition of one day you're sitting there waiting to get blown up by an ID. And
[01:15:54] then next, now you're sitting looking at the new crib holding your son. Yeah. And I agree, I know it's
[01:16:01] horrible to say, but like the mindset of not wanting to be a part of that kind of while you're
[01:16:07] still trying to work, I never, you know, in the Navy, we go on six months, maybe seven months,
[01:16:12] maybe eight months deployments. And I never went home from one of them. You know, the army
[01:16:17] would send guys home because they'd be on deployment, God bless them for 12 months, 14 months, 16 months.
[01:16:24] They, it was mandatory that they would send guys home. And even even like battalion commanders would
[01:16:30] go home for two weeks to give guys a break and give guys rest and let them see their families.
[01:16:37] But you go home, it's, it's two weeks at home. I mean, are you able to adapt at all? Or is it just,
[01:16:43] I just, I just send me back. I think maybe if your home life was consistent, there might be
[01:16:51] some utility in it. But when my home life had changed so much, like my wife couldn't even stay
[01:16:56] in her house because she had just had a kid. She was bedridden. She was at her mom's.
[01:17:02] You know, they're, I'm not able to take care of her. She's having to have her mom take care of her.
[01:17:05] So I've got to, for my two, he's go stay at my mother-in-laws. I've got a new kid.
[01:17:10] I mean, it just, it was like I was living somebody else's life when I came home and again, all you
[01:17:16] can think about is the constant combat you're going to go back to and it was just a lot.
[01:17:23] You roll back over there and you just maintain this optempo for the year that you're there. That's right.
[01:17:28] I mean, random operations, tag along on random operations. Well, I, I moved,
[01:17:36] probably in October, November,ish. I moved out of Eastern Pectica and moved into a
[01:17:41] Providence called Gazzini. There was a district called Andar. So we built the base from the ground up,
[01:17:47] called Andar, Fawbandar. And I moved to support 187. So I went from 3187 to 187.
[01:17:55] And back then, so this is in 2010, the Polish headroom that Aia for like two or three years.
[01:18:02] The Polish don't fire unless it's in self-defense, don't do anything aggressively. So that's why they put
[01:18:07] Americans there. And so again, we've been at war for at eight years at that point and it was almost
[01:18:12] like uncharted territory in the middle of Afghanistan. I mean, Gazzini is like the economic
[01:18:17] center, you know, maybe outside of Kabul. And so for, you know, it's similar to Ramani,
[01:18:23] where like I went to Sua, we've been in Ramani for six years and also, and I'm using baby wipes
[01:18:28] and we have no infrastructure and it's like, it's like we've never been there before. I felt
[01:18:32] this at the same thing happened when we went to Fawbandar. They were building it from the ground up.
[01:18:36] And it's even the the kinetic threat. It was like no one had done anything.
[01:18:42] And that area was different than the first one I described because the first one was much more
[01:18:46] distributed and which is like these long day patrols. That one was very much like day and day out,
[01:18:51] day and day out like flip patrol from the base or route clearance to just that adjacent little
[01:18:57] block over there. And so you were out, you actually moved to that outstation to that Fawbandar.
[01:19:03] Yes. And how big was that Fawbandar? How many people were there? Was it like a company
[01:19:07] Fawbandar? Was it a battalion? It's time to head quarters, but all their companies were in
[01:19:10] company outpost. So I mean, there was only probably 200 people in it. Did they have a company there
[01:19:15] that they were utilizing for that AO? That was running out operations for them. Yeah, I understand the
[01:19:22] question. I think I think potentially one of the companies was in the Battalion Fawbandar because
[01:19:26] obviously somebody owned that battle space. I can't remember. And so then you're there and you're
[01:19:32] doing the same thing. You're going out on patrol, whoever's going out on patrol, trying to capture
[01:19:36] the ID information, sending that ID information back up the chain of command. Yeah, so
[01:19:42] a couple more stories just illustrate that kind of what I did. One time one of the companies
[01:19:46] found a house full of, it looked like propane tanks, but I was like aluminum tanks filled with powder,
[01:19:52] found like a hundred of them. Just didn't know what it was. And so they threw them all in a well.
[01:19:57] And then they took a picture of it, put it on a storyboard. Wait a second.
[01:20:01] So the platoon's out on patrol. They find a hundred aluminum tanks filled with random powder.
[01:20:06] Yep. They don't know what to do with it, so they chuck them in a well. That's exactly right.
[01:20:09] They did not misstate that. And then, you know, young Captain Schellers
[01:20:15] reviewing the storyboards, because I felt like that was the right thing to do. Again, I didn't have
[01:20:18] a boss. So it was like, you know, as in general sport as a baton, but I really could have done
[01:20:22] nothing. How did I chose to do? But every day, went through all the storyboards, went through all the
[01:20:26] cigarettes, went through all stuff like was really trying to help myself. That's story right there. Like,
[01:20:30] I could, I could just imagine looking at what am I with two graders like, okay, tell me that again.
[01:20:35] Yeah, yeah. Wait, so what you do? Wait, what was in them? And you hooked them all in the well?
[01:20:39] And they were so ignorant. They then took a picture of it and put it in your storyboard.
[01:20:43] Usually you do something that like raises an eyebrow and you're like, I don't know if I should have
[01:20:46] done that. You know, and included it on the storyboard. So they put it in the storyboard. It's one of
[01:20:50] those things where I bet, up old team commander can articulate, you know, what we didn't know what to do.
[01:20:55] We couldn't carry them out. We didn't want the enemy to use them. The well was deep.
[01:20:59] Made the call. Sir. Yeah. It's like, okay, Roger that. I'm going to have to talk
[01:21:02] on brief this up the chain of command, but I got you back.
[01:21:06] Yeah. Okay. So it turns out it was aluminum powder. So in that AO, so in the first one, I was at
[01:21:12] it was all potassium chloride. There was a match factor in Pakistan. So all the IDs were
[01:21:16] potassium chloride. But in this new AO, they used aluminum powder with ammonium nitrate. So we
[01:21:23] called that anal actually. And so what they had in those containers was aluminum powder that they
[01:21:28] would mix with the fertilizer to make the IDs. And so I identified it. I pulled up a troll together.
[01:21:33] We went out. And when we got into the house, like, I'm literally holding this PowerPoint
[01:21:39] print out of the storyboard. It's got a picture of the house and it's got a well in it.
[01:21:43] And I'm like walking around. There's no well on the Queen of the White House. It's kind of dark.
[01:21:46] What had happened is they, the Taliban had come behind the soldiers and put like plywood over the
[01:21:53] well and then covered it in dirt. They basically hide the aluminum powder that the soldiers had
[01:21:57] all thrown in there. And so it took me like 45 minutes. But finally I was like, no, no, this is
[01:22:01] the house. Like, this has to be like right here. And then you start kicking it. You're like, oh, you know,
[01:22:06] so then we re-enit a disposal of all that. So there's one example of like, what does a counter-idee
[01:22:12] team leader do? You know, just caught that. And then the other thing I usually did was I walked the
[01:22:17] rails. So as an infantry guy, I would pull probably six or seven soldiers out of the route clearance.
[01:22:23] And on noon routes where we found a lot of IDs. And at the time I got my prawn star,
[01:22:29] where we were walking down a route, I'm on one side. There are on another side. And you could see
[01:22:33] guys messing with something on the road like probably an ID, right? So, you know, we try to close
[01:22:38] a distance. This guy runs away circles around. He's getting chased by my other guys on the other
[01:22:43] side street. And so he crosses the street while I'm running up the other side. And I was like one of
[01:22:47] the things where you like, you both come around a corner and you're like, based a phase. And you both
[01:22:51] just like try to pick up your guns and somehow you both miss each other from like three feet away.
[01:22:56] And you know, got behind a corner, killed a couple guys and some machine gun fire went off. And
[01:23:02] there was one point where like I just kept chasing people. And I found myself like 200 meters away
[01:23:08] from even like the guys I was with. Maybe like, you know, a half kilometer away from the patrol
[01:23:12] and the panic started to sit in my gosh, you know, like I'm kind of separated here.
[01:23:15] Um, but I was able to, I was able to bring the infantry up and link up and they got some
[01:23:21] orders down ranch. And the takeaway from the story is we uncovered seven ID's on the route that
[01:23:26] they rendered them all safe. And we were trying to do a complex ambush, right, with all those
[01:23:30] ID's and we were able to push, push them off. But like there's an example of like,
[01:23:36] great tactical success. Like what the fuck did that do in terms of the overall picture? Like I'm not
[01:23:41] really sure. Like on the tactical level. I mean, that was an awesome play that we ran.
[01:23:47] But I mean, just got so many examples of that. And then then I start studying the operational strategic
[01:23:51] levels. And I'm like, where was the connection to what we're trying to do? Like, why are they still
[01:23:54] coming from Pakistan? You know, what is my political leaders doing? Like, are we trying to get
[01:24:00] rid of the Taliban? Or would we want to have sure OK? Yeah, so many questions.
[01:24:07] So you wrap up that deployment. Yep. You come home. How's coming home? Now that you're home home?
[01:24:14] Yeah. So when I got home from Afghanistan, again, I was going to get out.
[01:24:20] But they offered me formal schools called Expedition Warfare School. It's Captain of
[01:24:24] Major School. It's a year. And I just thought, man, this deployment has taken a lot out of me,
[01:24:30] emotionally spiritually. Like a year in school with a bunch of other warfighters of my peer group
[01:24:35] probably really good for me rather than trying to jump into the corporate world. And so I took the
[01:24:39] U.S. job instead of getting out, which was in Quantico. You owe time after that. That's right. Right.
[01:24:45] Look at you. I want to step ahead of me. Yeah. So the catch to that is there's a two year
[01:24:50] requirement on the backside. So by taking the EWS job, I then was required to go serve two more years.
[01:24:55] This is a company command. And this is going to get you out to what how many years?
[01:24:59] Really gets me out to a career for us. But yeah, it takes me about 10 or 11 years. Yeah, 10 or 11 years.
[01:25:04] At which point a lot of guys say, hey, I'm only got, you know, what is it? You look at
[01:25:10] over one. Only got eight more years and really how many tours is that? Plus, one of
[01:25:14] that last tours of Twilight Tourists are really only have six years. So people start
[01:25:18] negotiating and rationalizing staying in. Even if maybe it's not 100% what they're into at the
[01:25:22] time. That's right. Which is, which is interesting because you're almost the whole time you've been
[01:25:27] saying you're going to get out. You're going to get out. You're going to get out. Which is weird. I
[01:25:31] never, I actually never thought I was ever going to get out until I got out. The whole time I thought
[01:25:37] I was staying in forever. I'm like, oh, I'm going to do 50 years. So watch this. And then it was a
[01:25:43] very abrupt for me. You know, when I was like, oh, you know what, I'm actually going to get out.
[01:25:48] And so I always thought I was going to stay in. Which was, which was, I guess it was very easy
[01:25:55] for my decision making process because I was like, okay, what do you guys need me to do? Yeah.
[01:25:58] What do you want me to do? Let me go to that, call go to that, whatever. Let's go.
[01:26:02] But you were always kind of, I think it was like we started with the beginning of my story.
[01:26:08] This, I never had ambitions to go in the military and this was never what I thought I would end
[01:26:13] up doing. The reason I continued to stay in is because I found a lot of purpose in being a
[01:26:18] marine officer and I truly enjoyed it, truly enjoyed being around the service members. So it's one
[01:26:23] of those things where I guess my self image was never to be a career military officer. But I
[01:26:29] continued doing it because I found fulfillment in it. Yeah, and there's also something beneficial
[01:26:34] about someone that's not considering that, oh, I want to be. You know, that's, I always joke about
[01:26:40] the seal teams because in the seal teams, if you ask a seal officer, a young seal officer,
[01:26:45] why they came in the seal teams, the answer, what job you want to do? I guarantee what they're
[01:26:51] going to say is, I want to be a platoon commander. I want to be a seal platoon commander. That's the,
[01:26:56] that's, which by the way, is like three years into your career. Yeah. You ask an army officer?
[01:27:02] What they want to do? A lot of them will say, oh, I want to be a battalion commander. I want to be a
[01:27:06] brigade commander. I want to be a division commander. That's actually in their head. Seal officers
[01:27:11] do not have that in their head. Most seal officers don't have that in their head. And there's
[01:27:15] something that's kind of nice about someone that's in the army that just says, hey, you know, I want to be,
[01:27:20] hey, I want, I don't have this big aspirations of being a general or a kernel. They just want to go
[01:27:26] and do the job. There's some benefits to it. There's also some interactions to it because once
[01:27:30] guys in the seal teams get done with that platoon commander tour, a lot of them go, okay, you know,
[01:27:33] I did that. And we've, in the seal teams try to extend the operational tour a little bit longer. You know,
[01:27:38] you can, you can extend it. You can go a little bit longer and still do work. But eventually,
[01:27:44] it's going to dry up for you. And you don't get to be a battalion commander. You can
[01:27:48] seal team commander, but that's not the same as a battalion commander. It's really not the same as a brigade
[01:27:54] commander. Cool jobs, but it's not what people come in for. So the fact that you were sort of
[01:27:59] always thinking, maybe I'll get out means to me in a positive way, you weren't trying to maneuver
[01:28:05] for your career. Because there's a lot of guys that, oh, yeah, here's, oh, I need to do this billet.
[01:28:10] I'm trying to get this award. I'm trying to get this deployment so I can get promoted. There's
[01:28:15] some people that that's what's driving their careers. And it's, it's never, it's horrible to see.
[01:28:21] It's horrible to see what they do. And there's guys in the, certainly, guys in the seal
[01:28:25] teams that are like that. That's there. That did have the goal of the two commanders just a step,
[01:28:30] just a stepping stone. Because what they really want to do is they really want to make out more
[01:28:34] whatever, same thing can happen in the army as well, same thing can happen in the Marine Corps. But for
[01:28:38] you, you're kind of like playing it by ear. Which means you're not making decisions based on,
[01:28:44] hey, I'm going to look out for my career. Which is a good thing in many cases.
[01:28:49] Yeah, I see that in Marsau, too. What you're the proud me described with guys doing what they
[01:28:54] want to do is a lot of got Marsau guys want to be a team leader. Or, you know, want to be a company
[01:28:59] commander, company commander is kind of the pinnacle where they then bleed off all the talent. Because
[01:29:02] the company commander at Marsau is a major. And then they don't stick around to be the batang
[01:29:06] commanders that they need them to do. But I also see that the general infantry, a lot of the
[01:29:12] counter to what you just said, there's a lot of guys that come in that have aspirations for
[01:29:16] meat of the tank commander, have aspirations for being in general. And there, you know, you kind of
[01:29:22] alluded to it. There may be some positives to that in terms of big thinking and, you know,
[01:29:28] speaking good about the system and figuring out how to navigate the system correctly. But I honestly
[01:29:33] think the focus should always be on the service member. And what's best for them? And I understand,
[01:29:40] as a leader, I've been doing this for 17 years, the responsibility to the organization,
[01:29:44] versus the responsibility to the service member. So I'm not saying all of our specs are
[01:29:47] leader, or at least you just be looking after the service member. But I think when you get focused
[01:29:52] on how to navigate your career, it does cloud your perspective on how to strike that balance.
[01:29:59] So nonetheless, you take the deal. And you go, okay, I'm going to go expedition to war for a school.
[01:30:05] And then I'm going to owe them two more years. So that's going to put you at 11 years, 12 years.
[01:30:11] Your wife's probably like cool, at least this might, I might be gone a lot, but at least you've
[01:30:15] got a job, but it's we're getting a paycheck. Yeah, I had my, so as soon as I got back from Afghanistan,
[01:30:21] she got pregnant with the same kid. So my two older boys are 14 and a half months apart. So that's like,
[01:30:26] you know, before Afghanistan, and then like first time getting home from Afghanistan. And then it was like,
[01:30:31] I, so I very quickly, within nine months of being home from Afghanistan, went from like no kids to two kids.
[01:30:36] You know, so this was life was changing. And then we, we waited another couple of years and had my
[01:30:42] third son in between my next two deployments. So how was expeditionary war for a school?
[01:30:47] I liked it. You know, the anxiety that I had after a body came back full fledged after Afghanistan,
[01:30:52] started having different symptoms, started having like face numbness. And my vision started getting
[01:30:58] blurred. And everyone wanted to lump it into PTSD, which I knew. I wasn't struggling with PTSD.
[01:31:02] I didn't have like bad dreams. I felt bad about anything. I did. I'd said like Tony Suprenowish,
[01:31:07] like real physical symptoms. And it just, people will then the buzz phrase was PTSD. And I just
[01:31:13] don't think people understood what anxiety was. And I just had to work through that. And so I don't think
[01:31:18] I really understand what what you're talking about. So PTSD would be like, oh, I'm having trouble sleeping.
[01:31:26] I'm the hyper alert and all that. What's the anxiety piece? What's what's going on with this?
[01:31:32] And is it physiological? It's both. So it's part hereditary, it's part, you know,
[01:31:39] nurture nature. So also it's part experience. So I think the simplest way to just say it is once
[01:31:45] your fighter flight gets burnt enough, your brain starts producing different chemicals that it
[01:31:52] may not be if you're not on high stress all the time. And for me, it just took a while to recalibrate.
[01:31:58] I had to get into yoga, I had to get into meditation. The best remedies work it out. So if you
[01:32:04] work out, stay healthy and stay fit. But the problem is a lot of guys after these deployments
[01:32:09] fall into the false trap of alcohol. And alcohol is one of those things where, you know,
[01:32:14] it can suppress some of those anxiety or things for a little bit. But what they don't realize
[01:32:17] is it comes back twice as worse the next day. And so EWS is one of those like false hopes for me.
[01:32:24] Or I was like coming back, I hadn't been drinking for a year. And I was like drinking beer. And
[01:32:28] I feel good at night in the next day. But I'm like, why do I feel so horrible? I was also getting
[01:32:34] older too. I mean, my 30s now, not my 20s anymore. And so I think part of it was just
[01:32:38] learning my body, learning all the physical reactions that took place in the deployment. And
[01:32:43] not allowing myself to just be bend in a PTSD category that may not apply to me. Even though that's
[01:32:49] what I think everyone wants to label someone when they get back from something like what I
[01:32:53] had gone through. And you know, it all worked out. I figured it out. But just took me green a lot of
[01:32:58] books and talking a lot of people. Probably more than I needed to navigate it. Let me ask you this.
[01:33:04] So if you get these like anxiety type situation and it's caused from some traumatic situation that
[01:33:12] you've been through. And now this is post the traumatic situation. Isn't it like what you're talking
[01:33:17] about? Well, I don't understand the difference between PTSD and what you're talking about anxiety.
[01:33:23] I think the the where way I distinguish it is PTSD from what I've learned from the psychologist,
[01:33:34] typically manifests itself into guilt, shame, emotional struggling with some of the things that you went
[01:33:42] through that may have a psychological and physical impact on you. Anxiety to me, think of it like
[01:33:49] you're about to do public speaking and everyone has butterflies but like a severe case of
[01:33:55] anxiety is almost like debilitating, right? And that those physical manifestations may not necessarily
[01:34:02] be tied to a trauma. They may just be tied to the way like you said physiologically or builds,
[01:34:09] or it may just be because you have experienced so many things that your brain is producing chemicals
[01:34:15] in balanced manner. Now I'm not a doctor, so somebody needs to check the stats on this, but I can't
[01:34:20] tell you having talked to many psychologists, there is a in the whatever that manual is,
[01:34:26] major differences between the two. Okay. And then you as you're working out and you're doing yoga
[01:34:32] and you start to get through that the that calm after you went through the drinking phase of trying
[01:34:37] to get through it. I always worked out, sometimes I worked out and drank, so I had to just
[01:34:44] get through the drinking thing and then just focus on working out. And this is all happening while you're
[01:34:50] at EWS, yeah correct. Learn anything good at EWS, what are you learning at EWS? EWS is a little bit more like
[01:34:58] operational level. I went to two formal schools, I went to command and staff later as a major,
[01:35:04] command of staff is very varsity level, treat you like an adult, here's all the reading, go read it,
[01:35:08] and we'll talk about it. It was adult EWS is somewhere between you're still in the basic training
[01:35:13] pipeline and you're getting close to an adult, but we're not really sure yet, so it's your
[01:35:18] treated as such and there are a bunch of captains that aren't criss yet that probably need to be treated
[01:35:23] like that, but thinking it's generalized too much. So there was a time when I was like,
[01:35:26] I'm a professional and I've been doing multiple wars, like the fucking talk to me like that.
[01:35:30] What's EWS? It stands for Expeditionary Warfare School. It's like the captain to major PME,
[01:35:37] said so you don't have to go to the resident, but you have to do the school, so there's like
[01:35:41] box of books where you can get sent the books and get credit for it that way, there's seminars
[01:35:45] where you can go to like night school for it, so every captain has to go through it to become a major,
[01:35:49] but they select the top ones to go to the resident one your course. That's where you got selected
[01:35:55] for. That's right. So your career's going pretty good at this point actually. It was an indicator
[01:35:58] that I was on the right track. And what do you, this is one year school, where you going at the
[01:36:06] end of that? Where'd you go in the end of that? I went to third Battian second Marines as a company
[01:36:13] commander, so it was a headquarters company commander where we, our deployment was another
[01:36:18] mu, there's 10 months, get on ships, sail around the ocean and be ready to respond. And as a
[01:36:25] headquarters company commander on a mu, I had like a reconplotin and I had an engineer putin
[01:36:30] and then I had like all the supporting and the establishment and the Battian. This is kind of
[01:36:34] an eclectic group of individuals and then they also used me as like the future operations planter
[01:36:40] if you will. So as the episodes on the ship they'd send me to like Egypt or they'd send me to
[01:36:45] wherever to do the planning for whatever that bilateral was. And so that was my 10 months deployment there.
[01:36:50] That was a 10 month deployment. Yeah, it was long ship forward deployment. It was like right after the
[01:36:56] delibia thing and the Benghazi thing and like the, and because of that thing,
[01:37:03] the mu deployments had gotten like backed up. Something happened that messed up the deployment
[01:37:08] cycle, being close to that operation. And so to like fill the gap, my deployment was 10 months
[01:37:13] because they always want overlap. And so I don't remember fully understand why it happened,
[01:37:18] but they told us from the very beginning like this is going to be a long one boys. And that was a
[01:37:21] ship board deployment. So you're living on a ship, which is good times. Yeah, something.
[01:37:29] But that's weird. That's almost like for me, you know, because I came in before at the war.
[01:37:34] That's like a normal deployment that we did back then. I did two deployments with the Marines
[01:37:39] on the Args out here on the West Coast, but it was like, hey, sail around, go to wherever we're going.
[01:37:46] Like I went to Egypt. I went to Oman went to these various random places and did whatever exercise
[01:37:52] we're doing. People getting spun up about whatever they're getting spun up about. You probably
[01:37:57] did you create any PowerPoint briefs where you're on that? You know, I did.
[01:38:06] All right. So that's another deployment and what what comes after that.
[01:38:09] So then I get back and they actually, I was still a captain and they tried to make me the operations officer.
[01:38:17] And I did the battalion operation. Yeah. So I had actually gotten the top company commander,
[01:38:24] finished report as the headquarters company commander, which kind of rare. So I think it just speaks to my
[01:38:28] Patank commander really like me, thought highly of me. And so he tried to make me the operations officer.
[01:38:32] And I wasn't selected that year. So I was going to be in zone the next year. And regiments like
[01:38:37] brother, we got like five majors sitting on the deck up here that need to keep it. Like if you're
[01:38:41] going to make a captain, it's not even selected. Like we're going to give you a major.
[01:38:44] And so he came back to me and was like, hey, like this is what happened. So you're not going to be the
[01:38:49] ops. So what do you want to do? Do you want to stay in the battalion? You've already done your
[01:38:54] company commander to her or do you want to go somewhere else? And in my community, headquarters
[01:39:00] company commander is like one of those weird ones where you can hide somebody there.
[01:39:05] And so it's not always the best guy. And so like in terms of street cred and my community,
[01:39:11] I didn't want people to think I was just a headquarters company commander, right? And so I was like,
[01:39:15] you know, I got a, no, I'm going to stay here and I'm going to go be the weapons company commander.
[01:39:19] So they offer me weapons company, which is like the probably the best company commander usually in
[01:39:23] battions. And so that's what I did. So I was a weapons company commander for the next year and a half.
[01:39:27] Did you do an appointment? How's it look? I did. So we did a deployment. It's called a unit deployment
[01:39:32] program. So we went to Okenawa and we're the purpose of it strategically. This did be involved in the
[01:39:37] war plan. If no, it's Korea where to do something. But all we really do is try to prevent our
[01:39:42] Marines from getting drunk and getting into the fights. And then we'll take them into, you know,
[01:39:47] Japan and go into Tokyo. We went into South Korea. And that's a six month deployment? Six months.
[01:39:52] What number deployment was that for you? Five. Including one of those was a one year deployment.
[01:39:57] Yeah, one was a year, one was 10. Her body was seven. And then the first music six and the UDP was six.
[01:40:02] So it all comes out to, I mean, about four years. Yeah, that was stuff up.
[01:40:09] And then after that, what's next? Yeah, what's crazy too is with all those deployments. Like
[01:40:14] that was middle of 15. Then I got promoted the major and I never deployed it. So quite honestly,
[01:40:20] all of that one was through my captain time, which is even what made it crazy. And so I got promoted
[01:40:26] to major. And the monitor at the time was actually the company commander of my puttune commander,
[01:40:32] buddy, who got blown up a Romani guy's name was Eric Clark and I knew him real well.
[01:40:37] And so we had a special relationship. And he had selected me for a place called PPNL. It's like
[01:40:43] plans policies and orders. And in the Marine Corps, it's a very prestigious bullet. So it's like one
[01:40:47] of those bullets. And if you do well, you can go on and be a general officer. So if you're a guy that
[01:40:51] is playing the deep game like you described, like that's the job you want. And I, at this point,
[01:40:57] I had decided it was going to be a career. So after three, two, I was like, this is, I'm going to go to
[01:41:01] 20. And I just had no desire to sit in a basement cubicle in the Pentagon and, you know,
[01:41:08] design a new helmet or whatever, I was going to do it, I just couldn't do it. And like you said earlier,
[01:41:13] like I loved teaching. And I loved idealistic young officer. So I asked him if I could go to the
[01:41:18] basic school. And he obliged, because he had a lot of people that wanted to do PPNL. So he cut me
[01:41:24] orders to the basic school. And you, I tell that story about I knew him, because it's not usually
[01:41:27] that easy to just talk to your mother and say, no, I don't want that. I want this and have it work out.
[01:41:32] But in that situation, it did. And so he got me orders to the basic school. And I got back from the
[01:41:36] UDP in July of 15. And then I off cycle moved in October 15. And I bring that up just to say,
[01:41:44] my kids and I have three kids at this point. They're the two older ones are in school. And I didn't
[01:41:50] want to pull them out of school. So I actually geo-batched, so just again, more distance, right?
[01:41:56] So get back from that deployment. And then I went and was living in a condo and DC and driving
[01:42:02] back to North Carolina on the weekends for nine months until the following summer when I moved
[01:42:07] him up. All right. So the basic school this time, you're on the other side, watching people go through.
[01:42:13] Is that a good to me? That sounds like a good loaning experience. Seeing people how they react
[01:42:19] from a leadership perspective and from a psychological perspective. That's right. Yeah.
[01:42:24] And it's great. The basic school is all taught by officers. So unlike school
[01:42:28] of entry where the instructor is primarily enlisted at the basic school, the primary instructor is
[01:42:33] the officer. So even as a major, they sent me through a pretty good training resident and I had to
[01:42:38] get qualified to train every single thing. So it's like they have a different qualification for
[01:42:43] each subject that you attempt to teach. And so they do a really good job there. I got to be
[01:42:47] the operations officer, a company commander, and the war fighting director, operations officer,
[01:42:52] and war fighting director, typically Lieutenant Colonel Billets, but I just got the opportunity
[01:42:56] because at that time they didn't have the Lieutenant Colonel's and they chose me to fill both
[01:43:01] those Billets at different times. So my three-year tour there. So I mean, I really got a great run out of that.
[01:43:07] And not to kind of like focus on this. You haven't really brought it up a little bit
[01:43:12] but just to kind of because where this story ends up, your career is like going really well at this point.
[01:43:19] Yeah, I mean, as you mentioned, you were the number one platoon commander. I didn't mention it as the
[01:43:24] weapons company commander. I got submitted for the left-witch award, which is you know, the best company
[01:43:28] commander in the Marine Corps. I didn't win obviously, but just to have my batang commander submit
[01:43:32] me up through the regiment and division for that was an honor. And then yeah, at the basic school,
[01:43:37] like the monitor tried to send me to PPU, and gave me exactly what I wanted at the basic school.
[01:43:41] Then when I got to the basic school, they made me the opso. I said, I'd brand new major, which is a
[01:43:46] normally Lieutenant Colonel's Billet. And then I did a company commander tour and then it was a new
[01:43:51] CO and then the new CO hand chosen me to be the warfighting director. And so yeah, I mean, I think I was very
[01:43:57] competitive now. Well, your fit reps look in like this whole time. I'm all top. I mean, if we want to
[01:44:02] skip forward the the judge in my case, it was like I've never seen a record. So example, exemplary
[01:44:08] and also high marks. So there's an impartial guy that looked at my reports and it's like this is the
[01:44:12] best I've ever seen. So but you got to keep in mind, like I said earlier at the basic school,
[01:44:18] the best captains went to TBS or went to IOC. And when I was a TBS, I was a major. The best
[01:44:23] of majors, don't always go to TBS, the best captains do. And so I was a little off track. And when
[01:44:28] out the reason is coming out of Ramadi number one, I didn't have anyone that used to be in the
[01:44:33] military. There's a lot of people in the military today. I think nepotism is prevalent, like
[01:44:38] general sons or at least had a regimental father. And they they don't get a free pass, but they
[01:44:43] understand the key billets that they need to go to. And they understand the relationships that
[01:44:48] need to be harnessed and and developed. And so these small advantages in the beginning turn into
[01:44:55] bigger advantages over time. So I guess my point is when I went to school of infantry as a young
[01:45:00] captain, that didn't help me at all as a professional. And probably even going to Afghanistan
[01:45:06] on an IA billet where I didn't get a report from a Marine didn't help me at all in terms of career
[01:45:12] progression. So like that whole three years where it was very important to probably separate yourself.
[01:45:17] I just didn't do it, but going into my three two company commander time because all those experiences
[01:45:24] I had did make me a very effective leader. I was able to really shine as a company commander,
[01:45:30] and those reports are really what stood me. Got me starting to separate from the pack and then
[01:45:35] as a major at the basic school again, same thing. So in those six years it was like I think that's
[01:45:40] when people started looking at my record and saying who's this guy. But I think most of my
[01:45:45] other peers that there's a lot of peers that I have that are I will admit much better than me.
[01:45:50] I mean smarter than me, more talented. And so I look at some of my peers and I'm just always impressed
[01:45:55] and I just always you know one of us fired to be like somebody's guys, but some of those guys
[01:46:00] were put on tracks early kind of hands-lected for things early that I just don't think anyone knew about
[01:46:05] me until later in my career probably similar stories to OCS and TBS, right? I show up on day one
[01:46:10] and I'm lost and by the end people are like, look this guy. Maybe he's not as lost as we thought he was.
[01:46:16] I think my career is almost the same story. So you get done with being the
[01:46:25] basic school instructor and then it's off to then it's that when you can win two Command and
[01:46:31] Staff College. Yep. Yep. And now so now you're in it to win it.
[01:46:34] Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Once I got to the basic school I was in it to win it. So yep, I went to
[01:46:39] Command and Staff got selected for school and it was nice because I was already up in Kwanakus.
[01:46:43] Is it hard to get selected for school? It's not. There's two things. One you got to be competitive.
[01:46:49] So probably in the top 40% which really isn't that much but top 40% and then you have to be
[01:46:55] the timing to make it. So there's a couple factors in place not always the best. Sometimes
[01:47:01] it's just about timing. And how long is this? How long are you go there for?
[01:47:05] Command and Staff's a year. A solid year and again now you're going to O time but you don't care at
[01:47:11] this point because you're doing a career. Your wife's on board with doing a career. She loves
[01:47:15] this stability. She's looking at retirement. Yep. She's like we're set for a life. She never said that.
[01:47:20] I mean we're over selling it now. But yeah, she I mean kids are all in school now. So my
[01:47:25] youngest is now in preschool. Three kids in school. They're still young enough that we want some
[01:47:29] stability. And my goal actually was to go back to Lijon. So when I was there as a captain I had bought
[01:47:35] a 50 acre piece of timberland that I've got four wheelers and stuff that I keep on it and then we
[01:47:41] still own my house in Jacksonville. So I had two properties still in North Carolina when we
[01:47:45] were up in DC. And so my goal after Command and Staff was to get back to North Carolina and just
[01:47:49] remain there to retirement. And so that was kind of my play. Now some of the some of the more
[01:47:57] conflicted thoughts you had when you were in Ramadi, when you were in Afghanistan,
[01:48:04] are you are you kind of just dealing with those as in like hey that's the way it is sometimes
[01:48:09] you know I can do a good job. I can try and mitigate that stuff in the future. When you're at
[01:48:13] Command and Staff College and you're talking about now more senior level strategic level things
[01:48:19] are you having considerations around those things or you having discussions around those things.
[01:48:24] Do you feel like you've sort of accepted that that's the way the system works and there's some
[01:48:29] benefits to it and there's some negatives to it and you can as you get more senior you can focus more
[01:48:33] on the benefits. Where are you at mentally? Yeah it's a great question. So at Command and Staff you
[01:48:40] can do a masters. I think it's part of the curriculum now when I went through as a student it was
[01:48:45] like an option. You didn't have to do it because it required extra classes and a thesis to
[01:48:50] write on your own times so some people just wanted to downtime chose not to do it. But I wanted
[01:48:55] the masters I wanted to challenge myself and most instructors there implore almost like they
[01:49:03] drive you towards writing something about like the tactical level small squad unit level like
[01:49:11] insightful novel idea. I wanted to write about foreign diplomacy and how it was broken.
[01:49:17] And I had been working on the small tactical level at the basics school for three years. I was
[01:49:21] the work fighting director for the year previous like there's probably no one more qualified
[01:49:25] to write some type of thesis 20 page paper easily on how to do that but it just it didn't
[01:49:30] interest me. And so I was reaching for foreign diplomacy. My instructors, my PhDs told me like
[01:49:37] every year there's so many that comes in here and talks about how the gold water nickels that
[01:49:41] needs to be revamped and it's just the same old stuff and you know my counter to that was like
[01:49:46] well it hasn't fucking been fixed yet has it and that there's probably nothing more important
[01:49:50] when we're still losing wars. And so despite all the pushback on it I wrote you're only supposed
[01:49:56] to write 20 pages and the parameters of the paper were minimum of 20 papers no more than 80 pages.
[01:50:03] So I wrote 65 pages like I just couldn't stop writing and I gave it to my instructors and they
[01:50:08] just handed it back to me like immediately like 65 pages I'm not going to read this.
[01:50:13] It's like you guys assign 80 pages a night of reading 80 pages a night. I just spent
[01:50:21] months writing this and you can't even give me the time to say these parts of your
[01:50:26] paper don't add value that you won't even like read it they're like make it less.
[01:50:32] And so that's what I was up against. I was like I felt like as an officer I wanted to be
[01:50:36] challenged academically and I just I didn't get it from the PhDs so I did I made it 30 pages
[01:50:42] got my master's checking the box and then nobody ever read the paper again.
[01:50:46] Did you learn any good information at Command and Staff Call? Was it helpful?
[01:50:51] Oh yeah I do think the you know like if you're saying Command and Staff Call is a value and
[01:50:58] a hundred percent the real question is could it be better and yeah it absolutely could be better but
[01:51:03] there's it's always easier to find ways for it to be better. I think from like 30 years ago
[01:51:08] what they have now is you know world's better and don't what we used to have like they have
[01:51:11] small groups they facilitate good discussions they really challenged my thinking on the wars I mean we
[01:51:16] went back it's like Frederick the Great and Prussia all the way through Napoleon and Civil War
[01:51:23] and modern day and I think they did a really good job but they didn't go in it too deep onto
[01:51:28] anything and they challenged me and like Henry Kissinger's book diplomacy I had never
[01:51:34] opened it up and they really pulled a lot out of there that challenged me and I believe in realism
[01:51:39] and I don't think American foreign diplomacy has really gotten to that level and it's been like
[01:51:43] explored a little bit but again they just exposed me to a lot I think it's really incumbent upon
[01:51:49] the student that wants their exposed to something to then really get the education on their own
[01:51:54] and it takes independence to be able to do that if you just go through the motions of what the
[01:51:58] school asks you'll get very little out of it. Was there any paradigm shifts in your fault while you were
[01:52:05] there? No my problem in an education system is I always start to get a little frustrated because
[01:52:14] there's like a system to the education system and like if you haven't figured out about me I'd
[01:52:18] like to challenge things and at a certain point people don't want to hear it and you just become
[01:52:23] a pain in the ass and so there's like a line that it's different for every person every boss
[01:52:27] I've ever had says I want honesty back what does that mean you like well I guess I'll find out
[01:52:31] through trial and error of giving you honesty back and there's gonna be a certain point where
[01:52:35] I'm gonna either read through your face or through your emotion or what you're saying to me that
[01:52:39] I've gone too far and now I'm starting to annoy you and then that's when you know you got a back
[01:52:44] off and so I always find myself in the small group discussions like I can dominate any conversation
[01:52:49] with my opinions but there's a time where you've got to read the room and understand
[01:52:53] you need to be a passive listener and so that was probably my struggle with it. I just felt like some
[01:52:57] of my views went counter to what they were trying to teach and if I was to get to aggressive with
[01:53:04] it it seemed to be counterproductive, vice-discussed and so a lot of it has to do with counter
[01:53:10] certainty you know it's the same thing as it'd be us like I just the way you win the way you fight
[01:53:16] a counter or the way you fight in an insurgency is to not get involved in an insurgency and that
[01:53:22] requires deeper thought on the operational strategic levels and we've just celebrated these generals
[01:53:27] for the last 20 years that have wrote the small wars, manuals or reinvented the small wars,
[01:53:31] wars, manuals and counter-insurgency manuals and there's a time at place where we
[01:53:35] is military tacticians need to understand how to do it absolutely 100% agree,
[01:53:39] read all the books, got it but to just continue to engage them for multiple decades without
[01:53:45] like real metrics of effectiveness or exit strategies, Afghanistan withdrawals just the perfect
[01:53:51] example. I mean there couldn't be a better historical example of how that was just
[01:53:56] terribly executed and it's just a symptom of a much larger problem and so a lot of these opinions
[01:54:02] I had in command of staff solidified through my paper and you know I left there I told the story
[01:54:07] about me handing the paper to the PhDs because that's just another example of like no one really
[01:54:12] cared they were there to expose you to the things that they were exposed to but they didn't look at
[01:54:17] like where Stoo Schiller was academically and say how do we get Stoo Schiller individually
[01:54:21] to be more challenged and developed to where we need him to be and maybe they don't have the
[01:54:25] bandwidth to do it but you know you look at the great military minds of history like
[01:54:31] classwits he had a guy named Sean Horst that was a military professional that sat there and
[01:54:36] and knew where classwits was met him there and then challenged him specifically and I just
[01:54:42] I sometimes wish I had that so you wrap up at that school and then where you off to and then
[01:54:52] I so I told the story if I wanted to get back to North Carolina so I told my monitor different
[01:54:56] monitor now don't have a relationship with this guy and so I had seen them on two road shows
[01:55:02] which is like yearly the monitors go around and you get an opportunity to shape what your
[01:55:06] desires are going to be when you're a mover so I told them two years previous I went North
[01:55:09] Carolina I don't care I don't know what's going on and no one really wants to campus you
[01:55:13] and so usually when you say campus you know it's like all right you got it but you know I
[01:55:16] had spent my whole time in campus you and Quonico I'd never been out to the West Coast or anywhere else
[01:55:21] and so I knew there was a chance that the Marine Corps was going to start to say no brother you
[01:55:25] you've you've homesteaded too long so then I saw him the year before or same thing and so he said
[01:55:30] all right I'll tell you what's to if it's not North Carolina I'll call you and keep in mind I didn't
[01:55:35] do my observability based on that story I told and as a major you gotta do what's called key
[01:55:40] billet and burn infantry officer that's up so our exo so coming out of command staff they're like
[01:55:44] you have to be an exo to remain competitive and so I mean everybody got orders in like January
[01:55:52] February March I mean I got to like the end of March we're talking like you're gonna move in June
[01:55:57] and I still haven't even talked to this guy like all the school registration is in like January
[01:56:02] my wife's asking me every day and I'm like you know I don't know to tell you babe I don't
[01:56:06] so I finally because I knew this guy's real busy but finally I just broke down and I called him
[01:56:11] and I was like hey man in a march everyone in my command staff classes orders except for me you told
[01:56:17] me you would call me if it wasn't campals June so I'm assuming I'm still going in the campals
[01:56:20] June and can you confirm and he he's like no campals June's filled he's like the good news
[01:56:27] we have availability and 29 palms are San Diego and I want you back so I got to the phone with them
[01:56:34] I'm I'm in no exact where I was I was at Panera and I was still writing my masters thesis at the time so I was like
[01:56:40] I used to go to Panera just right and so I'm sitting in Panera just mad and I'm thinking about all the
[01:56:47] property I got North Carolina and how like I'd been telling my wife it would be North Carolina for two years now
[01:56:51] so I wrote them an email email a little bit easier for me to not be as emotional because I can kind of edit it
[01:56:59] and I wrote but I want to put in writing now so hey man I'm putting this in and writing for you
[01:57:04] I'm gonna forgo keybill it there's got to be a sexual assault officer or some other thing in North Carolina
[01:57:09] that you can give me it's in writing make it happen and I had sand and like you know you gotta understand like how
[01:57:16] scary it is to do something like that because I essentially said my career's over in Panera
[01:57:22] but I wanted North Carolina and so then he called me back and said this is what he said
[01:57:27] he said I got your email I'm gonna give you exactly what you want and then he hung up
[01:57:32] oh my god I was like oh man yeah I'm gonna be the sexual assault officers like in
[01:57:38] rain division like this is and I'm gonna have to go back and look at all my peers and they're all
[01:57:42] gonna talk about where they're going to be botanics those or botanian offsets or wherever and I'm
[01:57:46] gonna have to tell them what crap job I just got because I did to myself and I know what he did
[01:57:51] then because the monitor has two responsibilities he's got a responsibility to the Marine Corps
[01:57:55] he's got a responsibility to use person and the monitor's job responsibility to Marine Corps is to
[01:58:00] keep competitive officers competitive so then he went he didn't know me from Adam so after that
[01:58:05] he went through my record and as he was going through my record he probably came to the realization
[01:58:09] like shit this guy's pretty good if I bury him in a staff job in secondary division then I end his
[01:58:15] career and he had a responsibility to keep me competitive but he also knew that I had like dug my
[01:58:19] heels in and I wasn't going to California without like probably you know screaming at top of the
[01:58:23] mountain so he was in like a new one situation and so that's how I ended up at Marseille so he
[01:58:29] wasn't advertising a Marseille support paty and exo and he had that kind of hidden on the shelf and so
[01:58:35] he called me back and he was like hey I've got a Marseille support paty and exo they're actually
[01:58:40] asking for infantry officers I haven't made a public it's not really keybill but maybe it is
[01:58:44] kind because it's still baty and exo just not an infantry batty and he's like would you be interested in that
[01:58:48] I was like fuck yeah I don't care a lot of Marseille I'm fucking this all worked out thank you you know
[01:58:53] and so that's how it happened and so I took second Marine's MRSB Marine Raider support paty and
[01:59:02] so it was called and so the way it works is Marseille's got three battyans and then they have three
[01:59:07] support patyans the support patyans have their logistics common in tomorrins and they basically just
[01:59:12] do a six month workup just in the MRSB and then they aggregate them to the MRB unit and then they
[01:59:19] do six more months and then so it's like a full year of training and then they deploy as that aggregate
[01:59:23] team and I was the exo so all I did was facilitate the teams on their timeline but I was only there for a
[01:59:28] year so quite on a sandwich saw like one full cycle and then other cycles in the state of
[01:59:33] the day. Did you go on deployment or no? So while I was there because they only have three
[01:59:39] battyans commanders and so they actually the battyans commanders of the support patyans are actually
[01:59:44] baged Marseille guys and so they have in that sense they have six battyans commander so Marseille
[01:59:50] has at any time six commands selected battyans commanders and so the so-to-down range they have
[01:59:56] a cycle of when those guys go down there and control command that unit they actually while I was the
[02:00:03] exo took my battyans commander to be in charge of the so-to-f so he doesn't deploy with the battyans
[02:00:07] he only to deploy so it's like maybe five key guys and then some other people from across the
[02:00:11] regiment so I was essentially the battyans commander for majority of the time while I was back there
[02:00:16] but I never deployed so I just sat there in courthouse bed with my battyans his battyans but I was
[02:00:24] acting and it was really it was a good time I truly enjoyed it and why was that bill on me a year?
[02:00:32] Because I got selected Lieutenant Colonel yeah good question I would have stayed in Marseille until
[02:00:35] they until I retired to be quite honest with you but I got selected to Lieutenant Colonel and I
[02:00:41] actually went to the vampire meetings those acting co and the exo and in the vampire meetings so
[02:00:45] I got hurt from the horses mouth they're like we don't have we're filled up with Lieutenant
[02:00:49] Colonel's at her badge like we can't accept any non-bad Lieutenant Colonel so you got to go kid
[02:00:55] so I was your wife during that year was everything going cool there yeah if she was kind of stoked
[02:01:01] she's in North Carolina and we had a we had a sweet spot then you know once we got back
[02:01:06] to North Carolina we were in our house it was familiar territory I was happy with my job at Marseille
[02:01:12] kids are in school now it's just a little bit of like sanity yeah I mean it was good thanks for
[02:01:16] good on the home front at that point and so then what happens when you make Lieutenant Colonel where
[02:01:20] do they send you so I mean I knew I got I found out I got selected in like October so I
[02:01:24] don't even have Marseille for like three months so like within three months to take in the job I was
[02:01:28] looking for the next job and so I had some buddies that were up in division second-bring division
[02:01:35] which was still local and so I basically started putting out dealers and I was like hey I'm going to
[02:01:39] have to move um I'll take a staff job up there got my exo job being the exo at a Marseille support
[02:01:46] potenti so I don't need to keep building more I don't think so if you could if you guys could
[02:01:49] take me out appreciate it and then I finished the year at Marseille and that in that spring
[02:01:55] the chief of staff of Marseille so an o6 talked to the chief of staff of the division who is
[02:02:03] an o6 the chief of staff both of those gentlemen are generals now actually and between that
[02:02:08] conversation they decided to make me the six Marines up so I don't know how that shook out
[02:02:15] I don't know if it was because they just thought I was that talented or because I had
[02:02:18] done keep building an infantry battalion that they wanted to give me the regimental
[02:02:21] opso to make me more of a career that's right but either way I mean pretty important job
[02:02:27] there's only two regiments in the division to be the operations officer of one of them was a
[02:02:31] big deal so I then I did that for the next year before I was selected to batani command
[02:02:35] and then what happened once you got batani command so I got selected to batani command
[02:02:41] shortly after getting to the regimental opso job so but the regimental opso job just to pan
[02:02:46] picture going into the story we're about to tell I mean it was the Marseille job was awesome
[02:02:52] fulfilling manageable hours good work the regimental opso job was like 20 hour days we spent two
[02:03:01] months at an ITX which is in the Mojave Desert where it is just expected that like I don't
[02:03:06] eat I have tobacco and I just drink energy drinks like it's almost like I'm looked down upon
[02:03:10] if that's not how I conduct myself and it just it took a lot out of me and my boss was
[02:03:18] not very appreciative most of the time and I got into some like this was kind of at the point
[02:03:24] of my career where I started really pushing back so like as a as a first lieutenant as a exo
[02:03:30] and a body with my batani commander was kind of verbally and even at times physically abusive like
[02:03:35] just kind of took it and in my head was like this is wrong but as a regimental opso as a 40-year-old
[02:03:41] man if you start telling me like I'm gonna I'm gonna what do you say I'm gonna fucking fill a you
[02:03:49] I'm gonna fucking cut you in half that's when I'm like bitch fucking come bring it we're fucking
[02:03:55] gonna do you know like these are the conversations we would have and it's it's like dangerous right
[02:04:00] because and I had these with multiple of sexes like I don't know what it is about regimental commanders
[02:04:05] but they they just felt like they could talk to me like like I was a piece of shit and I just got
[02:04:11] to a place in my life in my career I just wouldn't be talked to like that and so it created this
[02:04:16] unhealthy tension and then when I would push back on some of these conversations you would think that
[02:04:23] after like a couple days it would actually be like a steam release but it almost like it almost was
[02:04:33] like seen as a threat and it would almost increase the pressure where then they would come back
[02:04:38] and want to like reassert dominance which would then want to cause me to like reassert like fuck you
[02:04:45] and it just became unhealthy and everyone could see it and so you just gotta understand that like
[02:04:50] that's what I came out of after a year of just being overworked to like almost like fist fighting
[02:04:55] a couple times and then going into my batank of energy so you you're you're having clashes with
[02:05:03] regimental commander oh yeah and as this is happening are you think yourself like all right
[02:05:10] maybe I need to maneuver a little bit here you know I spent a bunch of time at expeditionary
[02:05:15] warfresh cool learning about maneuver warfare and not to attack you know hardened positions
[02:05:20] head on and here I am engaging in verbal battles with my boss yeah do you ever think like well
[02:05:29] maybe I should have taken a different tact so when you have certain people or certain
[02:05:39] expectations so you can just not push back and try and do it in our full way but
[02:05:47] that type of person is still going to expect you to work 22 hour days and be unappreciative
[02:05:53] when you do get the bus dress to get the product to them and then they're the follow-up
[02:05:57] question once you finally get that product is where's the next product and so sometimes you get a
[02:06:04] boss that just no matter what you do whether it's soft diplomacy or whether it's verbal fighting
[02:06:10] back you're just not going to probably change that person so the point you're making is like
[02:06:15] pick your battles and be smart but the point I'm making is at a certain point in my life
[02:06:21] I just refused to be talked to a certain way and so was that good for my career was I could
[02:06:27] from my mental health I don't know but like I just I kind of solidified who I was what I was
[02:06:32] capable of and how I was going to be treated and I was the bottom on and I had certain values
[02:06:36] that I wasn't going to compromise and I didn't care what I meant for my career I mean I've got a
[02:06:40] couple stories where like I basically tried to throw my career away a couple times because I was
[02:06:44] like this is important to me like this is important to me and you know you can think about what you
[02:06:49] want but when I think something is right like I just don't back away from that. What kind of thing
[02:06:54] would you put your kind of you know draw a line in the sand on? In terms of like regimental
[02:07:00] commander were like you know what I'm done with this. There was one time there's one time at
[02:07:07] ITX and so um the culminating event and on in the service for the Marine Corps at ITX is called
[02:07:17] MWX move forward for exercise and one regiment gets two battions and then one battion given hyper-enabled
[02:07:25] capabilities it's free force on force now it's supposed to be free but there's a lot of rules that
[02:07:30] almost drive this skibba maneuver but I mean it's the closest thing we get in terms of like I
[02:07:35] as a regimental officer with two battions with LAR with artillery and with a whole exercise force
[02:07:42] that determines who got killed and who doesn't get the build a plan but it's also like high stress
[02:07:48] and so most of our COC was back in the rear where I thought the regimental commander should have been
[02:07:57] but old generals and kernels think that they need to lead from the front and in doing so actually
[02:08:03] probably put a lot more risk on the system and they're not comfortable sitting back in a COC
[02:08:09] that has probably the capabilities that we need and so what that caused was him coming out with
[02:08:15] a forward capability that I had and in signature management when you're trying to like not turn
[02:08:21] on certain things or turn them on in a systematic way that disguises your digital footprint
[02:08:27] he and I were sitting in this tiny little COC that I made out of the back of a trailer
[02:08:34] and it was just one of those situations where I got like six computers I'm typing on all of them
[02:08:37] I'm trying to control the tying up so there's different LAR platoons I'm trying to worry about
[02:08:42] my signature management and he's yelling at me to do something and I'm like quickly answering
[02:08:46] him while trying to do all these different things and there was just like one situation where
[02:08:51] he snapped started screaming for an everyone and I looked at him and that was a situation like
[02:08:58] here time I'm going to move around for a while I didn't say anything I just walked out
[02:09:02] this is like I'm we're gonna fight so I walked out I took like 20 minutes and I came back in and
[02:09:08] he like hey up so like maybe you should just chill and get some sleep and that was his way of saying
[02:09:14] like maybe he went too far like trying to offer me some sleep and of course I'm
[02:09:19] just stubborn I might know I don't need sleep I'm just fine and like I talked to some of my
[02:09:23] guys after he did it in front of everyone and go my guys were like I can't believe you didn't hit him
[02:09:26] like I can't believe you had the balls to just walk away like I wouldn't have done that
[02:09:30] so there were times but I guess I'm just giving those examples because it's like
[02:09:34] man it's just you're exhausting me so it is what it is
[02:09:41] so you're in that job as the regimental officer operations officer when the Afghanist and withdraw
[02:09:48] was down is that right yeah so another relevant piece of the story is 8th Marines we used to have
[02:09:55] three regiments in the division and 8th Marines dissolved and so 1-8 actually got aggregated into 6
[02:10:02] Marines so I was the regimental officer that took 1-8 re aggregated them and then made sure they
[02:10:07] had all the supplies that they needed to go out on deployment so like I was working with their
[02:10:11] opso and exo like on the daily so I was very familiar with that unit that got on the mute
[02:10:16] that ultimately responded to the Kabul incident and so that's part of it right one eight
[02:10:22] was my first unit if you remember remember my best friend I hit with the suicide vest and then one
[02:10:25] eight was in my regiment that eyes the opso kind of man trained in equipped as much as the higher
[02:10:30] headquarters does to send them out on that deployment and then I was selected to batank a man so
[02:10:35] in June I went over to school of infantry and took advanced infantry training batank and that was
[02:10:39] in like mid June and you know August 26th is when the the S.V.S.T attack occurred so in June
[02:10:45] you were going to school you went to school no I I commanded a batank that was at a school so it's
[02:10:50] called an advanced infantry training batank and so that's the place where if you want to go
[02:10:55] to sniper school if you want to go through advanced squad later school if you want to go through
[02:10:59] advanced mortar school all the advanced infantry schools are housed under that instructor
[02:11:04] cadre of the batank that I commanded all right so just to get into Afghanistan a little bit
[02:11:12] just to get well not to get into a little bit but to put some context around it
[02:11:17] February 2020 Trump makes a conditional deal with the Taliban that we're going to withdraw
[02:11:25] September 2020 the Afghan government the Taliban hold talks in Doha the talks break down
[02:11:33] they they're not making any progress but America still continues this withdrawal plan
[02:11:38] February 2021 U.S. and Afghan government officials warn everyone that the Taliban is not
[02:11:48] abiding with the agreements they're they're doing offensive things they're making maneuvers
[02:11:54] April 14th Biden changes the withdrawal deadline from May 1st to September 11th
[02:12:01] which is let's face it you don't pick the dates of September 11th out of a hat there's
[02:12:08] a you know some kind of a symbolic gesture that that the Biden-ministrated administration wanted
[02:12:16] which is hey September 11th this things over April 15th the Taliban says up you guys
[02:12:24] re-nigged on what you said you were going to do you said you're going to drop by May now you're
[02:12:27] saying September we're going to take countermeasures May the Taliban start doing exactly what they said
[02:12:35] they start increasing attacks increasing in scale their attacks increasing in frequency their attacks
[02:12:43] June 6th U.S. contractors begin pulling out and when you pull out contractors now the Afghan
[02:12:51] forces and this is where you really start to see some of the problems that are going to
[02:12:55] occur when you pull out these American contractors that take care of gear and supply
[02:13:01] replacement gear all of a sudden all that's gone and this includes you know vehicles
[02:13:09] planes aircraft drones helicopter everything that they've got all of a sudden they don't have the
[02:13:15] capacity or the know how to keep it to keep it running July 1st America closes
[02:13:25] Bogram airfield like in a really kind of weird way of just leaving just kind of up and left without
[02:13:34] telling anyone didn't even tell the Afghan that that was going to happen the Afghan government that was
[02:13:38] going to happen just did it and by the way the bag room Bogram is you know is a great logistics hub
[02:13:46] it's a big massive airfield to well supplied well supported how long has it been there for 20 years
[02:13:52] you know 19 years some incredible amount of time so it's an relatively secure area fully functional
[02:13:59] and we just kind of leave it July 8th Biden says he's confidently the ability of the Afghan
[02:14:07] military to ward off the Taliban and fight the Taliban and defeat the Taliban July 23rd the
[02:14:17] Taliban starts applying pressure President Ghani is now not just asking but almost a begging for
[02:14:28] US assistance there's a conversation that that Biden had with Ghani and he says and I don't know
[02:14:37] if I'll nail the quote but he's saying that the perception is in the world that things aren't going
[02:14:41] well and Biden says hey whether it's going well or not we need to project a different picture
[02:14:49] August 6th Taliban takes full control of their first province and now this is in direct
[02:14:55] violation of what they said they would do in the deal with America August 15th Taliban takes control
[02:15:04] of Bogram no resistance they just walk in there there's a prison there they free a bunch of these
[02:15:11] high-level prisoners from various anti-Afghan government and anti-American forces
[02:15:18] they also enter Kabul that day President Ghani flees bail out apparently with a bunch of money
[02:15:27] and I will never get over the irony of the fact that President Ghani was this kind of academic
[02:15:32] individual that had written a book called Fixing Failed States a framework for rebuilding a fractured
[02:15:38] world and in that book he uses examples like Oregon the state of Oregon in America a first world
[02:15:50] country and that's how he talks about using examples of how to how to fix failed states
[02:15:59] August 16th Biden comes on and says yeah well you know the Afghan military's fallen apart because
[02:16:04] they're covered and their political leaders are weak August 17th Allied governments complaining about
[02:16:14] the lack of communication and coordination from America so they start their own rescue missions
[02:16:19] and we're hearing a lot about that August 23rd the director of the CIA
[02:16:26] William Burns meets with the Taliban leader with Bardar to discuss the evacuation
[02:16:33] so we're trying to sort of save what we can piece together some kind of an extraction plan
[02:16:43] that's on August 23rd on August 26th suicide attack
[02:16:49] 11 Marines one soldier one navy corpsman killed the Marines apparently
[02:16:58] they they there are reports that they knew that this attack was coming there's even some sources
[02:17:07] that say that the Marines were saying hey we got to put up a stronger perimeter we got to push the
[02:17:12] perimeter out and they got told no so that happens that's on August 26th and that is when you
[02:17:21] reach the point where you felt you needed to speak up about that yeah a couple other
[02:17:30] events in that timeline from a least my perspective so as the service members were watching
[02:17:35] all that playout real time in social media on the news everybody was getting very upset
[02:17:42] rightfully so so one day you didn't mention was 17 or 18 August the common out of the Marine Corps
[02:17:48] released a white letter that said hey I know a lot of you are struggling but I want you to know
[02:17:54] your sacrifices were worth it and if your struggling go see the therapist you can go go that's
[02:17:59] I just summarized the whole thing and I read that and thought this guy doesn't get it so
[02:18:06] reason people are upset is not because they think their sacrifices are worth it the reason
[02:18:12] they're upset is because the leaders have failed in this withdrawal and that is undermining
[02:18:17] all their sacrifices and he didn't address that at all in a hand wave of going to the therapist
[02:18:23] is not good enough so you can understand like I read that and it just just kind of started eating
[02:18:30] at me and then the other thing that you have to know is I've heard from the generals without naming
[02:18:39] names I've heard this story many times following Vietnam there's two common ones coming out
[02:18:47] Wilson and coming out barrow and what they did was and this is what's told today
[02:18:52] fix the service they focused on cleaning up the draft class the drug users and making sure they
[02:18:59] could fix the failures from Vietnam never does anyone talk about the operation on strategic
[02:19:05] failures that occurred at the general officer level at Vietnam that never got addressed and was
[02:19:11] happening right now in the at least the Marine Corps with the shift in the tactical focus and I
[02:19:16] understand I think there's actually a lot of utility in the new force design but what we didn't
[02:19:21] do was take a knee and address the operational and strategic failures that happened in our
[02:19:26] last two decades and I feel like the narrative is going to be told again that the generals
[02:19:31] had to fix the service because this current GWT generation isn't capable of fighting on the
[02:19:36] tactical level so I'm struggling with these two problems like senior leadership isn't addressing
[02:19:42] the failures and I have a couple examples of that and then yes that takes us to August 26 I'm
[02:19:48] sitting in my office as a batai in commander and I I'm literally I have people texting me pictures
[02:19:54] of the Marines that had gotten killed so like I'm finding out like within minutes that's the
[02:19:59] gossip on the inside the company commander for all the Marines that got killed was one of my
[02:20:05] SPCs at TBS meaning he was one of the one of the one of the potential commanders not in SPC he was
[02:20:11] a teacher at TBS I knew Jeff Ball real well and I knew some of the Marines so and I have this
[02:20:18] long history with one eight so there's just there was no one where it was more personal too than
[02:20:22] I felt like myself in that moment and so I sat there in my chair and thought I don't think senior
[02:20:31] leaders get it I don't think they understand the failures all these conversations about how well
[02:20:36] it's going I can't think in military history at least over the last 30 or 40 years where there has
[02:20:42] been such a monumental failure and not one person has acknowledged it and I just knew with certainty
[02:20:49] that following this event no one was going to be held accountable like I had enough experience
[02:20:53] and education to be able to foresee they're going to wash right past this and you can't make up
[02:21:00] for the lives that were lost but we can absolutely get ahead and prevent the next stupid decision
[02:21:08] by starting the whole people accountable and I felt the way to do that was through what I wanted
[02:21:13] to be just the one video like I did not plan it to be anything other than that I thought I'll make
[02:21:16] one video I'll explain some of the things that I think they should have done and I'm going to demand
[02:21:22] accountability because that's what I think we deserve because we're missing it and so that was
[02:21:27] what led to that first video and even after I made it like I I articulate in that first video
[02:21:32] that I knew I was potentially going to lose my job my retirement my family stability like
[02:21:37] obviously I had thought through that articulated it in the video and even after I made the video
[02:21:42] I didn't post it right away I went back to my house and was like pacing deciding whether or not
[02:21:47] to hit post because I knew as soon as I hit the button it was going to change the trajectory of my life
[02:21:51] but again I spent my whole adult life experiencing studying thinking living this and I just got to
[02:22:01] a place where I didn't think anyone else was going to say it I felt the need to say it
[02:22:09] videos about I think it's about four and a half minutes long something like that
[02:22:15] you're in your canmies so that's something so you're you're definitely not shine away from who you are
[02:22:23] you you know you stay you but you say in the video you've been in the Marine Corps for 17 years
[02:22:29] and one thing that I reflected when I saw the video for the first time is I thought to myself oh
[02:22:35] your entire career we'd been at war you know I spent more than half my career we weren't at war
[02:22:40] you know we were in the 90s the dry years but I'm thinking man this guy's been in the Marine Corps
[02:22:46] for 17 years the Marine Corps and America's been at war for that entire time you as you mentioned
[02:22:53] you said you know you got a lot to lose you know what could happen you knew you were risking
[02:22:58] your baton command you know family stability the whole nine yards you bring up that letter from the
[02:23:04] commandant that he wrote and you know you mentioned did anyone throw their rank on the table
[02:23:12] and say we shouldn't give a boggerman which again you know going back to the the silent five
[02:23:19] which is what McMaster called the the Joint Chiefs of Staff that work for LBJ and you can
[02:23:25] even hear you know that I've read in the beginning of guys that reflected back and said
[02:23:29] I should have said something I should have stood up you talk about the fact that
[02:23:40] the people that died dying in vain if we don't you you say you said if we don't own up and say
[02:23:47] we did not do this well in the end and you know I always look at that when someone gets wounded
[02:23:55] or killed in combat at a bare minimum at a bare minimum at least we go okay we can learn from
[02:24:05] what happened in the situation we can pass it on we can make sure it doesn't happen again and
[02:24:10] and that's what you're talking about and you kind of close it out by saying I've been fighting
[02:24:19] for 17 years I'm willing to throw it all away to say back to say say my two two my senior leaders
[02:24:25] I demand accountability and that's it pretty simple straightforward message you hit post
[02:24:37] I hit post you hit post how long did it take before you know you start to get in text from
[02:24:45] your friends and your senior leadership I could question no one's asked me this question yet so
[02:24:50] walked in the house didn't say anything got upstairs and I was sitting in my bedroom on the bed
[02:24:58] my wife was getting ready for bed she got a text she said did you post a video I was like yep
[02:25:05] I sure did she's like you know I won't say that girls name she's like so and so my friend
[02:25:11] it's texting me saying you're going about right now I was like oh go and what viral right now
[02:25:15] that's like you should probably watch the video tell me what I've so she watched it and she's like
[02:25:20] you need to take this down we're this is we're gonna get trouble take it down and I was like babe
[02:25:26] it's already up like you can't can't put the lid back on the bottle and even if I could I don't
[02:25:33] know if I'd want to so this is me saying this in this moment I was like I really believe in what I said
[02:25:38] in that video like I feel very strongly about it and so my wife then started feeling the gravity
[02:25:44] of what I had just done started stressing out and so then I went downstairs and was sitting on the
[02:25:49] couch and was just kind of thinking and then all my friends started texting me one of my friends
[02:25:54] from marsawc actually texting me and said still everything you said in that video is correct
[02:25:59] but it's going to come at way to have a personal cost and you're not going to change anything
[02:26:03] is it take it down and I told him I was like no this is the hell I'm willing to die and I'm not
[02:26:08] taking it down and then I had one of my instructors from aitv who texted me is gunny is sexually
[02:26:14] inter awesome dude he's like hey sir I watch your video and I agree with everything in your video
[02:26:20] but our adversaries could take this video and use it against us and I think you need to think
[02:26:25] about that and I think you should take it down and to hand my said you know there's probably
[02:26:32] even some truths to that but if we can't fix internally what we're doing right now
[02:26:37] with this conversation that I'm trying to start then it's all for nothing and so I guess those are all
[02:26:43] three true stories where I was like you know from my loved ones from my friends from people that
[02:26:47] worked for me were all I mean I and there's like ten other examples right so my phone blew up that
[02:26:51] night no one none of them in my chain of command contacted me that night so just people didn't
[02:26:57] knew me and you know I I've never my wife and I never like slept in separate rooms even when
[02:27:07] we were angry like early my marriage I was like I'm never you never making me sleep on the couch
[02:27:10] right like this is our house we sleep together we're gonna deal with stuff but I
[02:27:13] like that night I slept on the couch and I bring that up just to illustrate like that's how
[02:27:17] stressful it was it was just like was she mad just basically because you see where you were
[02:27:22] torpedoing your own career yeah like I said I mean we had stability like in those three years probably
[02:27:28] for the first time in our life and she thought she was gonna be there I had just taken the
[02:27:31] tank manor sees so she knew I was gonna be there for at least in two years and I only had a year
[02:27:35] after that total retirement so she knew she had another three years in North Carolina she had just
[02:27:39] started a new job as a teacher the kids were all in the same school for the first time she found
[02:27:43] they had all the stability that she wanted and then this took her by completes the prize and she knew
[02:27:49] that I probably wouldn't even have this job much longer so every all the stability she thought she had
[02:27:53] you know I took from her some people asked me about this when it was happening and I was
[02:28:01] like on social media or something like that and I got asked about actually I think it was getting
[02:28:05] interviewed on a news channel but you know my response was I guess I drew subconsciously from what
[02:28:16] hackworth says when they say oh do you think you become emotional and he's like yes I had become
[02:28:22] emotional because I've watched so many good men die and I am emotional and that's sort of when I said
[02:28:33] I said listen here's a guy that's been at war for 17 years who I guarantee he's lost marines
[02:28:40] and he's sitting here looking at this situation saying this is I'm not not getting I'm not taking
[02:28:45] this anymore when did you hear from your chain of command the next day?
[02:28:53] So as a batank manager I was always the first one in the office and it just so happened
[02:28:59] that that day my wife had a medical appointment and I had agreed to drop the kids off at like
[02:29:07] at school it's called a-to-clock and so it was like an abnormal occurrence so that's like the
[02:29:13] one day I didn't show up early and so I take the kids and so now I don't get into work until like
[02:29:21] 18 and as a batank manager you don't tell people when you're coming in you just show up at a normal
[02:29:26] time but I had texted my option accidentally I came around late and so I tell you that just to say
[02:29:34] my CEO had stopped by my office and called like three times and my upso called me and was like
[02:29:41] hey sir, CEO was really looking for aish probably calm and so when I drove in I got in I think I like
[02:29:47] eight thirty that morning, CEO was actually walking because his buildings let's say a two minute
[02:29:53] walk from my building he was actually walking between the buildings and I saw him and so I stuck my
[02:29:58] out the window and was like do you want to you're going to come back to your place he's like now just
[02:30:02] meeting your office so by the time I went and parked my truck and went in my office I used
[02:30:06] to be sitting in my office waiting for me. What is it? The first conversation between Colonel M.
[02:30:15] M. I came off as actually very caring and they keep in mind this is a career Colonel commands
[02:30:23] like that that doesn't know me very well. I've never met him before my batank man so he's had about
[02:30:29] six weeks of meetings maybe like seven meetings with me so I'm just imagine I mean he's another
[02:30:34] professional I'm professionally doesn't know me it's not like a guy I've been working for for a
[02:30:37] couple years or even a guy that knows a guy that I know real well like I don't know anyone that really
[02:30:42] knows anything that like we just don't know each other we haven't developed much of relationship.
[02:30:46] So he's like so he posted a video answer and he didn't really there wasn't much small talk he's
[02:30:52] like I wish you would have talked to me first if you would have talked to me first we could have
[02:30:56] worked through some of this and that's and he's right and that's a appropriate way and I said yes
[02:31:01] sir I understand and he's like I think that this video might be used to run messages that may not have
[02:31:08] been your intent I wish you would have thought of that and again he was right and then he just
[02:31:14] stated look there's gonna be an investigation that's gonna take place and then based on the
[02:31:19] investigation we're gonna determine what to do I'd like you to go home take the rest of the day
[02:31:24] and I will text you on Monday with where we stand in like all of that was very reasonable right
[02:31:30] very reasonable stuff was this already like on Fox News and I'll hit in the news outlets and all that
[02:31:35] at this point no so this was still sort of you know your Facebook friends you know and then like
[02:31:44] what was it how big was it right I mean I think it probably had received like 10,000 shares
[02:31:52] so I mean by the end of the night it was picked up by all the major news stations so in the morning like
[02:31:57] the comments obviously knew about it I mean everyone knew about it but you know it hadn't been picked up
[02:32:01] by mainstream media yet but it does buy the end of the day but like it wasn't like everybody knew
[02:32:07] hey when your friend your gunny and your wife for all like hey dude take take it down
[02:32:16] yeah what was a question I mean they everyone knew yeah and so my CEO left
[02:32:23] my exo came in and I turned over the the tying to him and then I went home and then
[02:32:32] and then when I got home my CEO called me an hour later and said hey I need you to come back and
[02:32:38] I'm starting to jerk you're out oh that was weird I mean me I'm office he's like no me me in my office
[02:32:44] okay so I mean him in his office and he just looks at me and says and hands me peace
[02:32:50] paper and says you've been relief for cause based on a lock and trust in confidence
[02:32:54] do you have any questions yes what do I do now is it I need you to come in tomorrow he's like
[02:33:02] what'll probably happen is though will be an investigation and I don't think they're going to keep you
[02:33:08] here he's like the probably move you up to quannico and general offered asked to maintain the
[02:33:17] investigation so that he can take care of you so he said I was like okay I'm trying to
[02:33:22] like reconcile that in my mind and but at the end of the day like I kind of knew I'd be
[02:33:28] relieved over it and I just said okay sir and so I signed up peace paper that said I'd been
[02:33:34] relieved I walked out and I actually made a post like immediately after it's still up on my
[02:33:40] page is my my face book and like then and just and I was very appreciative I said I think
[02:33:45] effective of 1400 today I've been relieved and then my command is doing exactly what I would have
[02:33:49] done I'd like to thank them for the opportunity of getting to service the AITB,
[02:33:53] Patanky Manor and I look forward to the next chapter right so very appreciative post
[02:34:00] obviously something changed for your regimental commander or somebody talked to him and said all right
[02:34:03] this is what we're doing yeah and but just so everyone just so civilians know what you're talking
[02:34:08] about relieved your command means you just got fired so you got fired and Patanky Manor is a huge
[02:34:13] stepping stone and it's really responsible to you so the ramifications were I would never get
[02:34:18] promoted again and you know as you were through the in your mind I had been relieved I've been
[02:34:24] fired so I knew I would never be promoted again but I knew that there was still potential for legal
[02:34:28] action right so like best case I am just like a disgraced lieutenant colon of the people
[02:34:35] somewhere at the limping towards retirement but you know worst case was I could be separated
[02:34:40] out via legal action and so I didn't know it was just unknown at that time. How many days was
[02:34:48] it until you posted your next video? So that occurred on a Friday and then I went into
[02:34:59] I haven't gotten in all this in the story so this is new stuff I went home and you know my wife
[02:35:06] now had kind of wrapped her head around life was changing and she was still down for the cause at that
[02:35:12] point so she was thinking like maybe we could go down to Florida my parents had vacation rentals
[02:35:17] and my command is the vacation rentals and I had I try to do like I'd father son days with my kids
[02:35:23] and I already had a pre-plan one of my oldest kid down on the outer banks she was like you want to
[02:35:28] cancel the thing with Paul my oldest son and I was like no I think I could probably use like a
[02:35:33] day away with just one of my kids she said we need to talk to the boys and I was like all right
[02:35:39] I was like I don't know if I can do a tonight I've just been fired why don't we you know give me
[02:35:44] the night and so went to bed I was the last night actually slept with my wife that night
[02:35:50] slept with my something the same bed with my wife got up the next morning I got the three boys in
[02:35:55] the couch and I told them hey guys your dad was fired but I was fired for doing something that I
[02:36:02] thought was right I wasn't fired for doing something you know bad or nefarious so I want you guys
[02:36:08] to hear it for me because your your friends at school are probably gonna tell you and nothing
[02:36:14] is gonna change for you you're gonna get to keep living here and I may have to go to Quantico
[02:36:18] to work for the next three years but you'll get to remain in school that's what I believe at the time
[02:36:24] so I told them then I took my oldest son and while we were outspend of the day on the boot all
[02:36:33] I was thinking about was what do I do and I kind of skipped over this to go back when I made that
[02:36:42] post that just thanked my command when I was on my social media I read a public comment from one
[02:36:48] of my previous boss so when I was at SOS a captain the lieutenant Colonel was my battalion commander
[02:36:53] that he did a lot for me he retired as at O6 he had gotten on my social media and said if
[02:36:59] Stuart's other was honorable he would resign he didn't state that he was my previous boss or that
[02:37:04] he was like a mentor to me he didn't email me he didn't text me and I felt like I mean that really
[02:37:09] was like a stab in the back to me because a lot of general officers that are on LinkedIn that
[02:37:14] they gave preferred LinkedIn not Facebook so that's why I had a LinkedIn too a lot of the senior
[02:37:19] officers knew who he was and so for him to call me out like that and so I'm struggling with
[02:37:25] when I'm with my kid on the boat I'm struggling with they relieved me without even an investigation
[02:37:30] like I knew my job as it risk when I posted that video but like I feel like a taller
[02:37:36] organization would have been like hey we're gonna let investigation play out we're gonna let you
[02:37:40] sit and calm down obviously this is personal but you've broken some rules and what's left the
[02:37:44] investigation play out and we'll see where the chips fall like that's the reason but they they obviously
[02:37:51] fired me within like 12 hours were you surprised when you got relieved I was surprised I didn't
[02:37:55] learn investigation take place I really was it did not I didn't expect that like when I was calculating
[02:38:00] what would happen I thought I might be benched while on investigation took place but I didn't think
[02:38:04] I'd be relieved immediately but even that probably wasn't enough to push me it was that next
[02:38:11] comment from my old boss where then I like while I was sitting there with my son at
[02:38:16] planet the seeds of I don't know if this organization cares about me as much as I care about it
[02:38:22] and so I just was struggling with this and so then it came back to like what do I want to do like
[02:38:26] if if none of them care about me do I want to limp towards the retirement for the next three years
[02:38:31] because that's best case and I just came to the decision like no I can't live my life like that like
[02:38:38] this was never supposed to be a career this was always supposed to be something that was fulfilling
[02:38:42] I don't care about the money as much as other people might I really don't like I'll be fine
[02:38:47] and I thought I need to get ahead of this and I'm not gonna let them just dictate the terms
[02:38:54] I'm gonna resign and I'm gonna tell them that because I still believe in what I said and they haven't
[02:38:58] addressed any of that and so after I spent the whole day with my kid on Saturday I kind of came to
[02:39:04] that conclusion Saturday night and so then on we slept in out there on the beach we had a hotel
[02:39:11] and then on Sunday morning I took him back to the house I dropped him off of my wife and I was you know
[02:39:16] I had been fired on Friday so I said hey can't go out to the farm I went out there every once in a while
[02:39:22] just kind of like me time and she was like yeah absolutely I get it and I went out there
[02:39:27] so all my 50 acres I've got two abandoned school buses that I put out there is kind of like trailers
[02:39:32] and we actually I I elisaed to a non-profit called A Hero and we do suicide prevention for like
[02:39:39] outdoor treatment for veterans and so that's why I have it I've had it I've had retreats out there
[02:39:44] for the veterans but when I went out there that Sunday I essentially on one of the school buses
[02:39:48] set up a video and the message of the second video was you fired me I don't think you care about me
[02:39:55] I'm resigning effective immediately I don't want any money I don't want any benefits
[02:39:59] and then I and I posted it and that's where you know really quickly became an escalating series
[02:40:06] of events between the Marine Corps and myself yeah and you know all this even your original
[02:40:14] message you were talking about what you wanted was accountability I mean obviously I wrote a book
[02:40:19] called Extreme Ownership and this is the the very if that's what it is right and that's what you're
[02:40:25] saying even after this video comes out there's still no one responding to anything in the video
[02:40:31] and and they also did some things where they're like they put they put some they made some PR
[02:40:40] maneuvers on you on you saying hey we're gonna make sure that he gets the help they need something
[02:40:47] along those lines so after the second video came out that was so again this was Sunday I was fired
[02:40:53] I'm Friday so I haven't been in the work yet so it's Sunday night well after I made a second video
[02:40:59] I mean it's 45 minute drive I posted from my farm there's a 45 minute drive back to my house
[02:41:05] about time I got back my wife had already seen it and was very upset and you hadn't pre-briefed your wife
[02:41:11] on any of this no that's why she was justifiably very angry and y'all won't go in all the details of that but
[02:41:19] that's where the that's where the path started the diverge between my wife and I and so I ended up
[02:41:27] going and staying in a motel so I was in a days in for the rest of the week and my yes
[02:41:34] dequestion you asked was they started making statements the Marine Corps PEO office public affairs office
[02:41:40] released a statement that was all over the media because now these videos were getting picked up
[02:41:44] that second video that I did was the banner of Fox News like if you went to FoxNews.com that day like
[02:41:50] that was the first thing was my my face on the school bus right and so the Marine Corps was trying
[02:41:57] to get out in front of it and they released a statement that said we are trying to locate Lieutenant Colonel
[02:42:01] Shellard to protect himself to protect him against himself and his family and I was like what
[02:42:07] and I had my phone on me the entire time and I had even talked to my battalion exo for like 20 minutes
[02:42:14] like I was texting my friends and I was like if the Marine Corps was really trying to find me
[02:42:20] like they didn't think to text me they didn't think to call me and so like potentially potentially
[02:42:26] the public affairs office arm just wasn't talking to like whoever should have been calling me and just
[02:42:31] got out ahead of it first but like the other part of it is maybe like they really just didn't care
[02:42:36] about me and all and they just put that out but like again I'm having all these indicators so
[02:42:40] this like this escalating thing of like me feeling like what I said is right all right you should
[02:42:45] show some sympathy and they're like no I'm gonna poke you in the chest because what you did was broke
[02:42:48] the rules and then I'm like well no come back and listen to what I'm saying like no you're still
[02:42:52] breaking the rules I'm gonna make it worse for you and so like each one of these is just an example
[02:42:56] of like if you think cared about me they would have called
[02:43:05] one thing that I noticed and I heard you talking about it you know at the end of that
[02:43:09] second video you're getting emotional and you're like asking for accountability and then
[02:43:18] kind of ranting against everything a little bit and you say you know follow me and we'll bring the
[02:43:25] whole fucking system down so you're you know going hard and I heard you I heard you later say like
[02:43:32] yeah I didn't choose the best words yeah I'm not appreciate asking that so people have asked me a lot
[02:43:40] do you regret it because my life is dramatically changed lost a lot gained a lot
[02:43:46] the one the thing I've come through this with the understanding is I wouldn't change my original position
[02:43:53] or the events at all I don't apologize but there are certain ways that I delivered the message
[02:44:00] that I would absolutely go back and tweak and the one shining example is the we're gonna bring
[02:44:05] the whole fucking system down in that second video and even in the third video I say a couple
[02:44:09] things that like could it or we're stripped out of context and so yeah you got to understand
[02:44:16] I mean in that second video like that emotion wasn't fake like I knew I was given up everything like
[02:44:22] I I was terrified and I was emotional and I didn't take multiple takes I was like one take
[02:44:28] Jay-Z get on the mic drop it post it right like there was no editing of that video and so
[02:44:37] I wish I could go back because it allowed the media to just paint me as this violent extremist
[02:44:43] and I don't think I ever came any recluse that like obviously in my my can't say obviously in my
[02:44:48] head I was trying to communicate that the system has centralized power it was corrupt and it needs to
[02:44:52] be fundamentally changed but in the emotional outpouring of the moment I said I want to bring
[02:44:59] the whole fucking system down you know I was just mad and I went back and clarified like it might
[02:45:05] like three days later in a post I put in a constitutional manner with one loud voice but like
[02:45:09] no one reads the follow up you know what I mean you get that one shot that's right
[02:45:14] especially when it comes to like a viable type videos that are gonna get out there no one's fault
[02:45:19] no one's following up with that you get home from that video and your life is like you
[02:45:29] didn't pre-pre-pre-pre-pre-re-re-re-re-wife now your life is just like no this isn't gonna happen
[02:45:34] that's right yeah I mean so you know I want I'm probably not gonna develop much more of the
[02:45:41] story with my life and I but I will say you know I still like this past Christmas after all this
[02:45:46] was done you know I got out on Christmas Eve we spent as a family all of Christmas together
[02:45:50] we went to a water park together like I still very much love her we are still going through a divorce
[02:45:56] this situation was very challenging and there's things that we both would have done differently
[02:46:01] and there's reasons the reasons I didn't say anything is because I knew what she would say and again
[02:46:06] this was very important to me but I think more than anything the reason we're going through a
[02:46:10] divorce and we didn't decide to reconcile is because what this situation did was illustrate
[02:46:15] the trajectory of my life and how I'm always going to be on the move and I think in one comment she
[02:46:22] summarized it with I just in retirement one learned how to play golf and you want to fundamentally
[02:46:27] change the government right those are two very different things and the story that I just
[02:46:31] painted you for the last 17 years I mean this woman has stuck by me and suffered through a lot and
[02:46:35] like she deserves a little bit of stability she hasn't had it her her whole adult life and
[02:46:41] she justifiably deserves that and you know she's still the mother of my children so I'll never
[02:46:46] have anything bad to say about it there's talking about the verb it's that I would have changed there's
[02:46:50] absolutely things I would have changed with how I handled my situation with her you know there's
[02:46:55] you know things that I still look back on and it makes me sad but at the end of the day you can't
[02:47:01] look back you just gotta look forward I've tried to do the right thing I obviously hit some
[02:47:06] minds while moving forward but I kept moving forward and you know she still a big part of my life and
[02:47:11] so that is what it is you know I was a rebellious kid and I like was a rebellious kid I listened
[02:47:20] the hardcore music I didn't listen to my parents I didn't like school I didn't do good in school I
[02:47:26] didn't I was like a rebellious kid you can just trace that streak all the way back to my birth
[02:47:31] so when I look at your you're from you what we talked about today from your birth on up it's like
[02:47:41] I don't see that streak and then all of a sudden it's just kind of manifests itself I get you
[02:47:46] look you're talking about when you're in a naughty you're giving away money to these locals and
[02:47:51] you're thinking this doesn't seem like to me I'm thinking that too doing the same thing I'm in
[02:47:55] a naughty a 2006 where former relationship with people I'm thinking okay well I guess this will
[02:48:00] move us in one direction but I'm not sitting there as a obedient you know slave as to what I'm
[02:48:06] being told this what you're being told do do it I always pushed back on my leadership throughout
[02:48:10] my career always had that rebellious streak and this just kind of like do you when you look back
[02:48:17] at your life do you notice things along the way that are indicators that you had sort of
[02:48:23] a limit to what you take I mean what's movie at movie reference what's the movie reference
[02:48:27] where the guy is like an accountant or something and then he just kind of loses it falling down yeah
[02:48:34] am I right because I never even saw that movie but I remember it yeah Michael does that's what happens
[02:48:38] right he's a normal guy yeah something happens he's not gonna take it anymore yeah nothing really
[02:48:43] happened he just reached his point in general at the beginning like there wasn't like any any indicators
[02:48:50] that was the beginning of the movie known not early yeah everything life traffic so what do you think
[02:48:55] stew are you do you see indicators in the past where you you're thinking like man I always had this
[02:49:00] in that no Michael Douglas basically going to suicide a rampage I don't think it compares
[02:49:07] it's fair again I think yes to your point I didn't always push back I started to give some
[02:49:18] examples there with my regimental commander to kind of paint a picture you know at a certain point
[02:49:24] I started to just solidify who I was what my values were and it's funny a lot of people have asked
[02:49:30] me this which I'm sort of surprised by the question well I haven't actually been surprised
[02:49:33] about a lot of the questions people give me but one of the questions was why now you've been in
[02:49:38] you're in a body in a seven you did all this your whole life why now and they were asking that
[02:49:44] question almost implying as if there's a democrat and that's a president and like I used my platform
[02:49:49] to exploit now to become popular the truth is I think people grow develop an appreciation right
[02:49:59] as a young firstly tenant I wanted to go serve my country you know when I look back on George
[02:50:05] Bush's philosophy to export democracy that was obviously stupid but if you ask 23 year old Stewart
[02:50:10] Chiller or you know I'm watching the Marines in Fluja all I could see or the Marines run through
[02:50:14] Fluja I used to love the movie Black Hawk Down when you watch that movie it's like to
[02:50:19] glorify it if you look at the operational failures it's a mallea that led to that event but like
[02:50:24] I didn't have a deeper appreciation for that so the question you're asking me is like why did I get to
[02:50:29] that moment I had just at that point had enough education and experiences and I was in
[02:50:36] enough of a position of authority that there just wasn't many other people like me at that moment
[02:50:41] and time willing to say what needed to be said so as time goes on after this when do they actually
[02:50:50] like arrest you do you get arrested right yeah so I posted that second video like a week goes by
[02:50:57] now you did you did a September 11 video too right yep did a third video you still
[02:51:02] not arrested yet nope and I even did a fourth video in my Charlie's where I basically
[02:51:09] after my my second a third video was like just kind of an outpouring of emotion when my second video
[02:51:15] was very angry or sign my third video I was really just talking about violence and I was trying to like
[02:51:19] take the sharp edge off the second video but I still don't really go back to accountability
[02:51:22] but after my third video now all my friends are texting me and being like dude you're looking a little crazy
[02:51:28] you look a little romantic right and so and keep in mind like after my second video even though the
[02:51:34] PAO office put that message out that they were trying to find me then when I went into work they
[02:51:39] command directed a mental health evaluation so my mental health was being attacked from all these
[02:51:43] different angles and it's so hard to defend mental health because if you really are crazy anything
[02:51:49] you say is marginalized because you're crazy right so it's like you're crazy and I'm like no
[02:51:53] I'm not like that's what a crazy person we say you know that's that's catch 22 right that's
[02:51:56] their both catch 22 right first crazy you don't think you're crazy that's right so how do you
[02:52:01] defend it so anyway so did you start wondering you know what you're laughing but like when
[02:52:06] everyone tells you it you do start to question like you know if everyone in this room is crazy like
[02:52:11] what does that make me either I'm the only sane one or maybe I am the crazy one so
[02:52:17] after the third video they actually offered me a deal illegal deal I could have just taken it
[02:52:22] now I've been that but I was like man there's a lot of talk of me being crazy and that didn't
[02:52:26] help myself with these two videos I need to end and bring the message back and so that's when I
[02:52:32] made that fourth video in my Charlie's like general McKenzie is like I can't think in military
[02:52:38] history where someone is so obviously culpable like it's just clear like the Emperor has no
[02:52:45] clothes you have to see it and I could go through all the details as to why I think that but that was
[02:52:50] the fourth video I was trying to bring the message back to accountability and so after the fourth
[02:52:54] video is when they gave me a gag order and just said I mean the gag order was crazy I don't think I've
[02:52:59] actually released the verb of you but it was like if you talk to him and he talks to him and they say
[02:53:05] that you said that you're going to jail like anything like online chat rooms like any email if you
[02:53:11] communicate this was because they offered you a deal but then you made another video that's right
[02:53:17] it's so now they didn't know what to do now I'm now I'm moving faster than their legal deals
[02:53:20] are moving faster than the investigation and they haven't actually charged me with anything so
[02:53:24] they're starting to get scared I don't know if scared's right where but they they don't know how to
[02:53:29] handle they don't know how to address it there's a guy that's not taking the deals and he's still
[02:53:34] making statements and they and everything they've done at this point hasn't been effective in stopping
[02:53:38] it so they hit you with the is this when they arrest you no this is the so after the fourth video
[02:53:44] is when they gave me a gag order so I'm still not in jail you so now you're not allowed to talk to anybody
[02:53:48] that's right you're not allowed to post on social media that's right and now the
[02:53:52] it can be in any form you're just on lockdown yeah a couple points number one I'm
[02:54:03] I constantly say to clients and people and friends we don't make good decisions or an
[02:54:08] or emotional like don't try it this started as a joke when I was a young and listed guy like
[02:54:14] we would go out drinking and make decisions you know and if the joke was hey don't make decisions
[02:54:19] don't make life changes I would volunteer for cartoons and do stuff like that so this is a good
[02:54:25] example right you take a step back and say okay where am I going to be strategically and this is
[02:54:33] another thing I thought about the time is taking a step back and saying okay where does it how does this
[02:54:38] play out strategic from a strategic perspective where am I going to end up just just things to think
[02:54:43] about which you're clearly like hey here's some wording I could have changed here's a thing that
[02:54:48] would have helped out my relationship so there's always things that if you can try and take a
[02:54:53] step back they're going to be beneficial to you almost guaranteed the risk to that is time
[02:54:59] the risk to that is time also the risk to that is you can rationalize to not do anything
[02:55:05] yeah that's right you can rationalize to get to a point where you say you know what it's not worth it
[02:55:11] and and again is it smart to do that calculus it probably is because my my feeling I don't I don't
[02:55:19] know you but my feeling is if you would have run the calculus you would have still came with the
[02:55:25] same conclusion you might have executed your plan a little bit differently but it's important to
[02:55:30] if you can take a step back run the calculus so that way the course that you plot will be
[02:55:35] the most effective course in what you're trying to do and this is just general you know I've got
[02:55:40] some friends and they know who they are who call me from time to time super emotional and I
[02:55:45] got to talk them through like what the strategic perspective is what it looks like over the long term
[02:55:51] and and how to make the next step forward so good good lesson learned and and again from my
[02:56:00] from just talking to you today I think you still would have made the same you would come to the
[02:56:05] same conclusion that this is something that I don't want to use the word passionate not that
[02:56:11] she's just that you were passionate about it but you were you were convicted you had conviction
[02:56:18] about what you were saying and and you know something else from my perspective in an ownership
[02:56:25] and an accountability perspective that I think people don't understand as leaders is if you make
[02:56:33] a mistake and you take ownership of the mistake that you've made then what you can do is you can
[02:56:39] fix the mistake and you can actually change things and just because you say hey this was my fault
[02:56:46] doesn't mean you necessarily get fired or have to resign you know any of these senior leaders
[02:56:55] could say hey this is what we thought we're not perfect I'm not perfect I made a mistake I you know
[02:57:01] I did that I did that with I I made a speech coming from president Biden if I was in president Biden
[02:57:07] shoes what I would have said and it was like hey I made this mistake we under we underestimated that
[02:57:13] means I underestimated that means I thought that the Afghan forces were stronger that means I thought
[02:57:19] that the Taliban was weaker I miss misassessed and miscalculated how this unfolded here's what we're
[02:57:27] doing to fix it and and this is the thing that I think a lot of leaders don't understand when a person
[02:57:32] does that when a leader does that the the team doesn't think oh you see that's right you will
[02:57:39] messed up no they think okay yep he messed up but he's humble enough to take ownership and we're
[02:57:43] gonna get it fixed and we and we'll support him now this is my whole freaking career was taking
[02:57:48] ownership when things went wrong and and so I think just again to some of these senior leaders
[02:57:55] when you take ownership of something it's not it's a step forward it's not a step backward it is a
[02:58:04] true step forward and by the way when you blame other people or you deny or you act like it didn't
[02:58:09] happen that is a step backward that's what people don't understand that's what leaders don't
[02:58:13] understand they understand that saying well it wasn't it was the Afghan people's fault it was the
[02:58:17] Afghan military's fault that's not a step forward it feels like one but it's not it's a step backward
[02:58:23] because every single other person knows people know the truth about what's going on they can sense it
[02:58:28] and I think that's one of the reasons why your videos were widely shared because people thought
[02:58:35] this guy he he knows what he's he believes what he's saying and he
[02:58:41] he's speaking from a perspective of truth like people people saw that people want like oh
[02:58:46] he's trying to blame the leadership what's wrong with that guy no people like yeah he's trying to
[02:58:50] blame leadership because the leadership is wrong and they should admit that they should take ownership of it
[02:58:58] so you get gagged gag order comes then what do you at what point do you get arrested all right so
[02:59:06] I got gagged on what's called a Friday I went through a Saturday Sunday one to two
[02:59:11] Zones did there was to Friday so now it's going into the next weekend and that following week on the
[02:59:19] Tuesday Wednesday I knew that the Secretary of Defense the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[02:59:25] and General McKenzie were going to be testifying to the House and the Senator and so
[02:59:32] I calculated if I violated the gag order they might have a disproportional response
[02:59:37] and that that would bring attention to the whole message that I was trying to illustrate
[02:59:42] so I made another post that was this one was probably my most insightful you know it had some
[02:59:50] like insightful language in terms of not like revolutionary insightful but I mean I personal attacks on
[02:59:56] people like I attacked all the like the last four presidents you know I attacked general officers
[03:00:00] and I didn't say anything that was untrue but like I said some like hard stuff to hear it wasn't
[03:00:05] very like it wasn't like a uniting message it was just like a fuck you to everyone and again I even put
[03:00:12] in the post I'm ready to go to jail but before I made the post I read the entire UCMJ
[03:00:19] Mania for Courts Marshall and so I knew what the requirements were to send me to jail
[03:00:23] and quite honestly I didn't think that they had the criteria to send me to jail I was kind of
[03:00:28] prepared to go to jail but I didn't think that they had the legal ability to do so
[03:00:32] providing in a gagboard that I thought was illegal and so that was the only time I
[03:00:38] violated the gagboard was that one time and then I showed up at zero eight on Monday and they had
[03:00:44] PMO wait and for me and they sent me to jail and the way they did it was they wrote on the
[03:00:49] document that I was a flight risk which was like just an outward line I showed up at zero eight
[03:00:55] on Monday right I've been with every day on time the full time answering every phone call
[03:00:59] so like it's just a lie and no one will be held accountable for that but that was what it was
[03:01:03] and got to jail that Monday morning and but my calculation was correct all the generals
[03:01:09] had to answer questions to include the secretary defense about why I was in jail because I
[03:01:12] went to jail on that Monday and they started their testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday and then I was
[03:01:17] out you know six days ago I was a total of nine days so you end up getting charged with
[03:01:23] Article 88 contempt toward officials article 89 disrespect towards superior commission officers article 90
[03:01:33] willfully disobeying superior commission officers article 92 dereliction in the performance of duties
[03:01:39] article 92 failure you obey order or regulation article 133 conduct on becoming an officer and a gentleman
[03:01:47] how long did it take for that trial process to come about usually it takes months they did mine five days
[03:01:59] after I got out of jail so you spent six days nine days in jail and what were you doing in jail
[03:02:05] to sit there yeah I was in a solitary cell yeah I honestly all I did was right so the first two days
[03:02:13] I didn't have any any writing gear books and then by like day three my lawyer was able to drop off
[03:02:20] like all these legal pads pens books and he gave me my command investigation that just had
[03:02:26] I mean we can get a death we want but I mean all these statements from these other officers it just like
[03:02:31] weren't just lies just straight up personal attacks and so I was like writing on the legal
[03:02:38] just example of like oh he showed a plate to work that kind of thing oh yeah so
[03:02:42] he was smiling as in his command photo we don't smile in command photos I knew I didn't like him
[03:02:48] when he when I saw that I know another one this one guy they use that in the court of law against you
[03:02:58] these are like I don't like people it's my we either I agree with that guy these are just like you know
[03:03:03] side of the mouth comments these are on statements that they sign right I mean these are normal
[03:03:08] states this one guy I was at the beach with this family a week previous and I went to his
[03:03:14] house for dinner to his previous with our families to hang out and like when I was in that motel
[03:03:18] we're like you know I had no other like can scattered my life's falling apart like I could probably
[03:03:21] really could have used a friend and he was texted me it's like hey still how you doing man just
[03:03:25] want to make sure you're alright it's anything we can talk about like why you doing this
[03:03:29] he then screenshot it those and brought them to the investigating officer unsolicited
[03:03:34] to say look I was trying to figure out what his motives are like he this stew sheller is just a
[03:03:37] fucking a ferries character she'd never been a batile in command you're like who does that like what
[03:03:44] man does that blood in the water there's blood in the water man sharks are going to pounce
[03:03:51] yeah but they didn't realize that I wasn't you know yeah so you end up going up trial and this
[03:03:58] trial the judge you said looked at your record and was like hey well where did this come from the judge
[03:04:03] I don't think one of me to plead guilty so it wasn't you know all those charges you read off
[03:04:09] and there's like all these findings of facts the only choice there's only one choice
[03:04:14] except guilty for all of them at special court martial or plead not guilty to all of them
[03:04:18] the general like so to give in the weeds about what any of them said it was almost irrelevant
[03:04:24] and so so if you did not not not guilty what would happen how to go to general court martial
[03:04:28] and I did remain in jail for another four or five months while they prepared on pretrial while
[03:04:32] they prepared the general court martial procedure and then I would have gone and tried to plead not
[03:04:35] guilty to all of them at general check and then you you pled guilty to all of them again there's no
[03:04:44] like I want to plead guilty to these two and out these three is it is there's no point even
[03:04:48] looking at the details of it it was do you plead guilty to all of this you maybe need to read it
[03:04:53] stew do you plead guilty to all of this at special misdemeanor you get a the lowest character
[03:04:59] characterization of discharges general and ronable which is a little term and later or you go to
[03:05:05] general plead not guilty and if you get found guilty of one of any of these it's a felony
[03:05:10] and you'll get dishonorable and you'll sit in here for another four months and I'll tell you what
[03:05:15] even with that choice I thought very strongly about doing the general because how is it going to say
[03:05:20] bro you're a dysphoria and I know god I know I've got a surprise I know I almost did that and I think
[03:05:26] and to the judges you know sentiment I really think I could have won but you got to I
[03:05:31] would I ask myself was what's the most important thing the most important thing the reason I gave
[03:05:36] all of this up was not to beat them it was to preserve the message of accountability and if I
[03:05:42] felt deep inside that I had broken some of the rules for me to beat them based on undue command
[03:05:48] influence and legal duplts I felt like what a marginalized my message of accountability
[03:05:52] and for me to plead guilty for breaking the rules and then look at them and say look I'm not
[03:05:57] apologizing but I'm accepting accountability I felt it strengthened my message and it also expedited
[03:06:02] my exit so that I could come on you know joccos podcast and talk about how general McKinsey needs to
[03:06:08] be fired right so for all those reasons again I made more sense to plead guilty
[03:06:14] and that so that was kind of it almost anti-climactic a little bit you you I'll tell you though
[03:06:19] there was some drama and so like I said the fastest court martial from exit of jail and agreement
[03:06:25] in the history of the Marine Corps also one of those charges like 88 I think I was the first officer
[03:06:29] charge since Vietnam like they were just like throwing stuff on the wall right but they released
[03:06:34] the command investigation with all those like it's just crazy things that those officer said
[03:06:39] to the media with my medical investigation so that selective articles could be written about
[03:06:44] like how I was a violent extremist and it was just blatantly false stuff like I'm still on
[03:06:48] the fence of whether I should sue for libel or just like move forward but so once they leaked
[03:06:53] at that investigation your point the judge the judge was like if that's true like this is
[03:06:58] criminal like those people should be brought to the court not Lieutenant Colonel Scheller and so
[03:07:04] the Marine Corps was like forced to do another command investigation on the leaked command
[03:07:08] investigation so they did another command investigation and so then I asked for that other command
[03:07:12] investigation because it had to do with me and they're like no you gotta go through freedom of
[03:07:16] information act and I was like let me get the straight so you had an investigation that was about
[03:07:20] me that you leaked through the improper channels you were scolded by the judge you created a new
[03:07:25] investigation still about me about your improper handling and the only way for me to get that
[03:07:29] is to go through the problem the proper freedom of information act like that's correct and I was like
[03:07:34] ah you know this is like have you done that? no I haven't ever come home you gotta relax
[03:07:40] kind of just probably already burned bigger down of me honestly but I probably will so going back I
[03:07:45] probably will sue for libel this one publication and I'll probably freedom of information act
[03:07:49] to add to that libel suit but like right now the most important thing again is the message
[03:07:55] and making sure that people understand I mean there was fundamental breakdowns that are not being
[03:07:58] addressed apolitically that's what I want to change so like do I have grievances that I can legally
[03:08:04] pursue sure but that's like I said earlier like money is really not that important to me so
[03:08:09] we'll figure it out and so you part of your rep part of the deal was you you resigned and you
[03:08:16] were done you're done on the Marine Corps that's right at 17 years maybe 18 years now 17 17 years yeah
[03:08:22] and then you got out what just before Christmas Christmas Eve Christmas Eve that was it
[03:08:28] that was it where were you when you were out what was that night like
[03:08:33] my family came down actually yeah so I looked my family just acted like it wasn't happening
[03:08:41] honestly I don't even think it's hit me because right now you know someone that's listening to
[03:08:45] the show were tape in this and early January but after Christmas with my family then I started
[03:08:50] doing all these media shows that I've been on a gag order for the last four months so I don't think
[03:08:54] the reality was actually hit me yet it's gonna come when I'm done doing on this media and I'm sitting
[03:09:00] in my place by myself with nothing to do that's probably when it's gonna go shit but I've
[03:09:07] stayed too busy for it to be really it so what's so here you are here I mean this is only freaking
[03:09:14] weeks what's next what are you doing so I just want to what's the new mission so I want to illustrate
[03:09:22] like why I'm so upset with general McKenzie and so I'm gonna just take a second talk about that
[03:09:27] and then I'll answer your question through that so the reason I in that fourth video tried to
[03:09:32] prefer charges against general McKenzie which is my legal right to do explain I didn't touch on that
[03:09:37] explain what you did you explain what you did there in the manual for court marshals rule 137
[03:09:43] clearly states that any member of the UCMJ can prefer charges against another member in the UCMJ
[03:09:49] now that when you prefer that means that charge sheet has to be routed up to the first general officer
[03:09:55] with general court martial authority it's sometimes it's at the current level and so the strategy there
[03:10:01] was I knew general Alfred was trying to hold me accountable I knew he would never have the courage
[03:10:07] to refer charges from my preferal but then he would have to publicly declare that he wasn't going
[03:10:13] to seek accountability against the general and he was seeking accountability against me so I was
[03:10:18] using that tactic to illustrate the hypocrisy of the system but they denied me the ability to
[03:10:23] even route it which is my legal right to do I mean it was just I mean illegal in my opinion but
[03:10:26] it doesn't matter so that they don't allow me to do that the reason I was trying to prefer those charges
[03:10:31] is because general McKenzie is the Cent Comcombat and Commander he works directly for the secretary
[03:10:38] defense who works directly for the president what happened was in you know the the story you gave
[03:10:43] in the withdrawal from Afghanistan general McKenzie and I know the operational planners that
[03:10:47] developed the plans for the withdrawal they submitted for the National Security Council
[03:10:51] four or five plans most of them included keeping Bockemaribus but they needed 2500 troops if you
[03:10:57] go and watch general McKenzie's testimony on the backside he says I tried to say that I we need
[03:11:02] a 2500 troops why that's relevant is because they determined that that number was what was capable
[03:11:07] maintaining Bockemaribus when president Biden and the National Security Council said no you
[03:11:12] got to go below 2500 then general McKenzie was at a critical moment right so as a as the senior
[03:11:19] military advisor you have a responsibility to convince your boss why you should execute your plan
[03:11:25] and you can't force your boss to do that but every staff officer knows how to get I mean
[03:11:28] as an operations officer there's an art to making sure that my boss does the plan that I think is
[03:11:33] best because I know better than he does in a lot of ways so it's it's artful but he failed to do that
[03:11:37] so once he failed to do that and he looked at the restraints that were imposed upon his plan
[03:11:42] if he didn't feel like he could execute the plan effectively without undo loss of life
[03:11:48] he had a moral obligation to resign he did not do that once he didn't resign at that point
[03:11:55] he is accountable he doesn't get to go back after the fact and say no I told the president
[03:12:00] National Security Council 2500 and they didn't listen to me he doesn't matter
[03:12:03] that you didn't convince him and you didn't resign it you're the senior military advisor so
[03:12:08] for all those reasons I think general McKenzie should be held accountable right now just as I've
[03:12:13] started this media tour 72 hours ago the White House released the general McKenzie was being
[03:12:17] replaced in the spring by a new sent calm combat commander and I don't think it's a coincidence
[03:12:22] to be completely honest with you because I've been hitting the media pretty hard that guy is
[03:12:26] going to undermine his whole career if he doesn't raise his hand and say he should be accountable
[03:12:29] before he exits so that's one thing I think the operational level of war which is at the combat
[03:12:35] commander level linked to the political policy strategic level of war which is a national security
[03:12:40] council executive branch is where we're failing wars where we failed the Vietnam it's where we
[03:12:45] failed the GWT generation and how you do that as you hold leaders accountable at that level
[03:12:49] and right now Congress and the executive branch aren't holding up there into the bargain I'll give
[03:12:54] an example of what I think is wrong with Congress when I went to I placed myself in jail on a lot
[03:13:00] of ways to illustrate something and I underestimated I overestimated Congress's ability to do anything
[03:13:07] because by partisan took turns with their sound bites of anger about the fail afghanistan withdrawal
[03:13:14] and then guess what nothing Congress's given by the founding fathers leverage over the DOD is the
[03:13:22] budget and what was not in the news is six days previous they unanimously approved a $740 billion
[03:13:29] or 22 fiscal year budget and not one of those vocally outraged congressional representatives said hey
[03:13:35] you're asking for $740 billion who's accountable from the afghanistan withdrawal show me metrics
[03:13:41] of effectiveness for the 21 budget because to do that would require courage to do that would get
[03:13:46] spawn as potentially anti military and that would go against self preservation so what do I want going
[03:13:52] forward I want the operational level of war combat and commanders to start being held accountable
[03:13:57] in the same manner that they were in war war two and look at how many generals Lincoln fired before
[03:14:01] we got to grant and grant wasn't a good tactician but he had operational foresight and he knew how to
[03:14:08] stick with it the second thing I think is we need leaders not politicians so I've got a website
[03:14:13] authenticamericans calm where you can see some of my political views but ultimately it's where you can
[03:14:17] support me and I've also got a second website votes for vets.org because I think we need leaders
[03:14:24] not politicians I've in the four months that I've been on a gag water gone out and organized a bunch of
[03:14:29] people running in the 22 race so I've got five senators and 20 congressional representatives
[03:14:34] that all I think embody the leadership and courage that we need in politics and some of them
[03:14:39] I think have a real good shot at winning some of them are more of a long shot but it's I have the
[03:14:44] ability right now at the platform I built to raise money bring in media to some of these races
[03:14:50] bring in different organizations to support some of these leaders that I think need to be up in
[03:14:55] NTC and is that also linked through authenticamericans.com for the for the people that are running
[03:15:02] for the vets that are running votes for vets okay number four so votes for vets.org is really where you
[03:15:08] can see most of those candidates my website authenticamericans really you can donate to the
[03:15:14] disabled veterans pack through authenticamericans and that money ultimately will go to support
[03:15:19] the coalition that I built but I they're separate authenticamericans is really my brand of my thinking
[03:15:25] and I'm not gonna run most likely in the 22 race I plan to just support these other veterans I've
[03:15:30] been through a lot like I said I think I need to stabilize a little bit and reassess the landscape
[03:15:36] before just continuing to sprint but I do think you know my whole life has been America I love
[03:15:42] America and I love foreign diplomacy and I think the federal politics game is where you really
[03:15:47] make that those changes and so I see myself running for something but probably won't be told 24
[03:15:53] so that's what you're gonna do you're planning to go into politics right now
[03:15:55] in the future in the future I mean right now I'm probably gonna write a book probably you know
[03:16:03] figure out where my house is gonna be at so you know I'm gonna spend a couple of years
[03:16:07] getting my foundation stable until I see something that I think makes sense it's a lot going on man
[03:16:18] it's a lot going on man I can't believe you I'll be got out a month ago that's kind of crazy
[03:16:24] I it seemed like longer time at past you're on social media you're on Facebook on Instagram on Twitter
[03:16:36] yeah if you go to my website all my social media is linked at the bottom so if you just go to
[03:16:39] authenticamericans.com you can find all my pages it's all at Stuart Scheller SCHALER
[03:16:47] yeah it seems like we're at a decent place to close it out to have been over three hours
[03:16:54] echo Charles yes sir any questions I don't actually I was gonna say do you do why don't you
[03:17:00] like write a book or something you are gonna so they go yeah I've been writing all these social media
[03:17:06] posts and this one guy commented me the way they say he was I think he was trying to be nice he's like
[03:17:09] hey still have you ever thought about writing the book instead of slowly writing a book over Facebook
[03:17:14] yeah that's the Facebook seems to be like your primary well the reason social media I mean
[03:17:20] Instagram and like TikTok or really the new generation but Facebook allows long written posts
[03:17:25] and so really now that if you look at it linked in has has a smaller character limit
[03:17:30] and so what I've done now is it's the same post on Facebook and linked in so really
[03:17:34] the linked in character limit is like the exact character limit of all my posts because I usually write
[03:17:39] like two pages and then I try to pair them down for the character limit but it just goes to
[03:17:44] I think the attention span of our current generation they can has to be in digestible chunks
[03:17:50] you know you get one of your books and it's a lot harder to get them digest but if you hit them
[03:17:53] with like five posts separated by three days you got to I think a much higher chance to get in
[03:17:57] them to digest them of that what are you hearing from the marine core right now they've done
[03:18:02] constant right they they have a lot of articles have been written on me since I got out and started
[03:18:07] doing this media and the same statement is we're not gonna comment on a civilian that used to
[03:18:12] serve in the main core and so they've got like one comment that's that we're not gonna comment
[03:18:16] about it and so we'll see though I'm hitting them with a lot of media so that might change but
[03:18:20] like you said it's only been like one week since close to Christmas they've been back so who knows
[03:18:25] what about your friends in the marine core what do they say nothing I mean the the
[03:18:30] the lieutenant kernels that were closest to me in the investigation that I've made I've
[03:18:33] counted a couple interviews and just illustrated what they said they've obviously gone calm silently
[03:18:37] all these other guys that I know have come online and been like that's bullshit that they did that
[03:18:41] and so I think they're probably having a hard time kind of reconciling what they did at least
[03:18:46] I would if I were them I mean I can't speak for them but I can't say I've had a lot of guys
[03:18:50] speak up and so I can't believe they did that like that's so snake in the grassish yeah I mean
[03:18:56] you said you've listened as podcast a little bit I am a huge fan of the marine core
[03:19:02] in fact my my family says that whenever I talk about the marine core I have a quote
[03:19:06] and they'll joke about it I say the marine core is freaking square the way that's what I tell
[03:19:11] you know for whatever reason I'm with my family and the marine core comes up I'll be
[03:19:14] I can bring course free in square the way and it's the truth I love the marine core
[03:19:19] I worked alongside the marine core pretty much my whole career and just if I think the marine
[03:19:24] core is outstanding and this is this is rough this is rough to watch this unfold
[03:19:30] well to be clear I love the marine core I think the marine core is pretty square the way but that
[03:19:34] comes from you know the individual is such a high calmer person holistically in the marine core
[03:19:40] the problem is the centralization of power over time and it kind of puts the blinders on
[03:19:45] so there's some fundamental things that need to be addressed but everything that I'm doing is not from
[03:19:50] contempt or or hate it's from a place of love I have I whole higher guard for the marine's and I
[03:19:56] still think highly of them oh well tell you what you do you take that that 65 page draft
[03:20:03] they had they got rejected and then when you would you cut it on 30 yeah so that other 35 pages
[03:20:09] so you put in your book yeah there you go we all kind of want to hear about that you see yeah
[03:20:15] right on Stu you got any closing thoughts before you shut it down
[03:20:19] now I'll just echo to your audience as I watched my saga unfold in the media
[03:20:26] the mainstream media is so polarized right now it was very hard to get a true assessment of like how
[03:20:31] people even felt watching the news because you know most of the people were taking my statements
[03:20:36] and trying to fit them into whatever their narrative was and shows like yours podcasts like yours
[03:20:42] YouTube channels I was actually getting much more accurate feedback from what people thought
[03:20:47] than mainstream media so I really believe going forward if the mainstream media can't figure
[03:20:52] out how to reconcile kind of their own polarized views that platforms like yours are even more important
[03:20:59] so I just encourage you to continue to get more and further well I will and there's recently
[03:21:04] some information that came out about a Joe Rogan and he's just annihilating the mainstream media
[03:21:10] which is awesome it's just total destruction I mean maybe two three four times what the mainstream
[03:21:18] media has for listeners Rogan has so and and he's one of you know he's the leader he's the the
[03:21:25] head of the pack but there's a lot of other a lot of other people out there that are doing the
[03:21:31] same thing trying to get the word out and trying to talk in a nuanced way about things and you know
[03:21:37] you're a perfect example of a guy that's going to get interviewed and have they're going to
[03:21:42] interview with questions four sound bites that they can make headlines that the people will click
[03:21:47] that's their goal and so you know having you on here to actually give your perspective
[03:21:53] your full perspective say whatever you want like that's the goal so people can actually hear
[03:21:59] and understand where you're coming from and I think that's important yeah well uh thanks for
[03:22:06] coming on man appreciate it thanks for traveling all the way out here I know you uh never made it to
[03:22:11] camp Hamilton or 29 palms for a to be stationed but you finally got to visit city at least for a
[03:22:16] little bit thanks for sharing your story thanks for sharing your concerns thanks for sharing your lessons
[03:22:22] learned um then I know what you did and what you're doing is not the easiest path but you're standing
[03:22:31] by what you believe to be right and what I believe to be right which is people need to take on a
[03:22:37] ship when things happen and that is commendable and I hope uh that despite the negative impacts
[03:22:45] that this has had on you on your life I hope it eventually has a positive impact for the Marine Corps
[03:22:52] for the military at large and of course for America and on top of all that man thanks for your service
[03:22:59] absolutely yeah hey uh you're down the road bring me back on the show see where I'm at
[03:23:04] awesome man thank you all right and with that steward sheller has left the building
[03:23:13] definitely uh appreciate him coming on
[03:23:16] an interesting journey that he's been on um yeah just thinking about some of the stuff that he
[03:23:26] talked about especially from you know at the end start talking about the the political ramifications
[03:23:33] of things that happen and again these are all things that I talk about these things in leadership
[03:23:39] strategy and tactics right you give up your influence um but at the same time like David Hacquard
[03:23:46] just get to that point where you're not gonna take it anymore you know what he what he's talking
[03:23:50] about McKenzie one thing that's interesting is he he and I just thought of this as right
[03:23:59] of right as steward left but you know he mentioned that you're in that position the president says
[03:24:06] no to your plan did it your duty to turn your rank and that is one way of looking at it for sure
[03:24:13] but also you know the other way and I talk about the leadership strategy and tactics
[03:24:19] that's one thing to do or is it your duty to mitigate the risk of the plan that's being
[03:24:25] utilized that's another way to look at it as well and he but here's where
[03:24:31] either of those two options here's the the point that I think is important and this is
[03:24:40] steward agree with this the outcome you own that that's the difference this is something that
[03:24:47] you know when Napoleon said if you if you follow orders even if you know they're wrong
[03:24:52] if you follow orders you're culpable so that's the point so where I might disagree with steward
[03:25:00] that it's the duty of someone to turn in their rank if they can't convince their boss or turning
[03:25:07] their resign from their job if they can't convince their boss that that is one way of looking at
[03:25:12] it at it I would say that it's your duty to execute the plan to the best of your ability and then
[03:25:19] take ownership of the fact that you didn't weren't able to convince your boss take ownership of
[03:25:25] the fact that the plan that executed was one that you agreed to execute and you did and it failed
[03:25:30] and it's your fault so just to again I'm sure you know we'll be able to talk about this
[03:25:36] some more in the future but I wanted to as I was walking back upstairs after I've forgotten
[03:25:43] stew just thinking about that fact of look again one way to say it is your duty to turn your rank
[03:25:50] in my opinion it's your duty to either turn your rank or take ownership of the plan and take ownership
[03:25:56] of the outcome of the plan that's what you do so a little nuance on that but appreciate him coming
[03:26:07] on and again trying to try to be able to allow someone to share their entire perspective so
[03:26:16] he's trying to do the right thing we're all trying to do the right thing we're all trying to do the
[03:26:20] right thing yeah we should be trying to do the right thing I think so too yeah and I think that
[03:26:26] starts with you know improving ourselves yes trying to do the right things in our own world
[03:26:33] it's true yeah seems like something we all should be doing yes I could tell there's any recommendations
[03:26:38] on how we might do that yes I will so well okay so my recommendations are I talk about this
[03:26:46] four things there's actually eight but these four things and they're divided into two each one
[03:26:51] all right this is as far as recommendations to do the improve yourself so you have
[03:26:55] your relationships this is two kinds of relationships my opinion or that can be categorized I think
[03:27:02] uh there's your health and capability two thing um your money and what you do with your time
[03:27:11] and your world view and spirituality the four things okay essentially so you want to improve that
[03:27:20] if you feel like you're lacking in any one of those pay attention to try to improve it good news
[03:27:27] about that about this whole thing good news we have things that will help you improve all these things
[03:27:35] that's it good that's a good thing let's start with the physical actually the physical part of it
[03:27:38] I think is is a big one you know and so well you want to set early on this particular podcast
[03:27:44] sure that the physical one will possibly influence all of them yes and factually factually
[03:27:52] and what I didn't say which is equally as true the physical one will negatively impact all of them
[03:27:58] oh look at that it's slide I'm telling like I actually wrote about both those things and leadership
[03:28:03] oh no in the discipline because freedom failed man oh yeah and you know we all heard the
[03:28:08] hey if you don't have your health you don't have anything like you know like that whole thing I mean
[03:28:11] yeah think about it like if you're like okay let's say you have the best you just landed the best
[03:28:15] job and it pays a lot and you love doing it so you can't really fight as fairs can't walk
[03:28:21] though up the for or you now are gonna are at risk of XYZ terminal diseases yeah no one takes out
[03:28:31] yeah that's not a good situation regardless of how much money you make or what if you have great
[03:28:35] great relationships intimate family friends great but you neglected your health now you're on the
[03:28:42] path to demise does that help your relationships no does it hurt your relationship oh yeah everybody
[03:28:49] sad including you by the way either way you see where I'm going with this all right so let's take
[03:28:52] it care of our physical health let's improve our physical I like it never too late to start my opinion
[03:28:57] well after your dead little bit too late but we're live and we're doing it
[03:29:05] uh good news we have some supplementation to help you on this path physical and mental boom here we go okay
[03:29:13] so a big one that I actually I don't want to say I didn't pay attention to it because I do take it
[03:29:20] every day but it just sorted just you just take it as a vitamin D3 that's immunity that's all it's a
[03:29:25] lot of things that's a big one yeah I feel like when I got Miss Rowna yeah no factor really
[03:29:31] partially because of vitamin D yeah I'm thinking so I'm gonna give you um that I have the exact same story
[03:29:37] so yeah the first time we caught it that was like 20 years again I here's all tight I don't know
[03:29:44] I didn't test positive technically but here look we went end of 2020 right that's when we got it yeah
[03:29:52] no symptoms at all not even like the one actually I don't want to say no I lost my sense of smell
[03:29:59] right that's it no fever no cough no cough no temperature no factor didn't miss a workout nothing
[03:30:10] my workouts as I reviewed I was noticed that my workouts were a little bit weaker than normal
[03:30:15] but I just thought I was over training or something like this yeah you have a bad day yeah no
[03:30:19] sugar and then uh boom right well they say if you have a fever you shouldn't workout
[03:30:25] you can have a cold but if you don't have a fever you can still work out you're about to
[03:30:29] be still like respond correctly that's what I hear I don't know so so this kind of recently we'll say
[03:30:36] an undisclosed time um members of my family took a coronavirus test tested positive so took the test
[03:30:44] no quarantine there's very many good reasons to believe that I whatever they had that my family
[03:30:52] remember had I got it too good reasons will be I'm not going to go into how or why other stuff
[03:30:58] the next day after that the results come back positive right for my family oh yeah test positive
[03:31:07] same deal of course I got it I have two of got it technically I didn't go take a test in test
[03:31:11] positive so I don't know the full disclosure so again no symptoms no symptoms no fever no cough
[03:31:16] no factor no cough no factors in fact so technically I got coronavirus on paper this is what I got
[03:31:22] not in real life not in the field there was no coronavirus to be seen or heard or felt anything
[03:31:29] there's only on paper I attribute that too I think anyway they care that I took of my immunity
[03:31:38] by the midd3 cold war by the way cold war isn't every day it cold war is like you see
[03:31:43] something on the horizon boom cold war all day oh yeah preemptive strike on that
[03:31:48] sir savagery yep so we got all that jockel fuel cold war vitamin d3 we got stuff for your
[03:31:54] joints joint warfare no it's a theme everything is war against this bad stuff all right
[03:32:00] cuz that's kind of what is the emergency there is surprisingly enough our theme is war the
[03:32:05] child war against weakness organs disease or robots war against robots by the way just in case actually
[03:32:11] we like robots from time to time nonetheless okay all right also if you like energy drinks
[03:32:15] or if you would like energy drinks but you don't want to help the ramifications that some
[03:32:22] traditional energy drinks provide for a lack of a better term we got something for you to
[03:32:27] just plain go energy drink all healthy so good no preservatives all natural no sugar all natural
[03:32:35] all natural all natural vitamin vitamin B12 vitamin B6 electrolytes it's so good for you oh yeah
[03:32:44] only 95 milligrams of caffeine enough to get a little bit not enough to give you the
[03:32:49] care so if you're on this path and you're down for energy drink scenario this is
[03:32:57] 100% the one it'll keep you on the path not off you drink a bad energy drink you're kind of off
[03:33:01] the path this is not this one boom on the mock don't forget about mock and look you're going to
[03:33:08] get situations where you're like in your life where you have you're on the path you're feeling good
[03:33:13] you're doing disciplined and you just ate a freaking salad with a chicken breast
[03:33:21] super elf hey oh yeah yeah you can have dessert you know 100% good for you yeah so
[03:33:32] so we had a scenario actually I shouldn't even say it because they kind of fell off the path
[03:33:37] but we had a scenario a friend of a friend daughter birthday scenario cake was involved
[03:33:45] big chuck and he was like a cupcake but it was like way bigger yeah but it wasn't as big as like
[03:33:52] a regular sized cake I don't cakes not that tempting to me because I only like the frosting okay
[03:33:58] I don't know those good bro this one was a chocolate what is frosting do you know what it actually is
[03:34:03] what is it well it depends on what kind but uh butter there's a lot of butter in it butter sugar
[03:34:10] flavoring there's like a flavoring of some sort um like chocolate frosting this is butter sugar
[03:34:16] and chocolate and like cream I think that's pretty much it that's part of like there's a lot of
[03:34:21] fake part I don't like that's why cupcakes not really my thing bro I make exact opposite
[03:34:26] and there's six of them and they're huge so you know the kids eat something it's a birthday I get
[03:34:32] them let it slide but bro those big cupcakes there's a lot of leftovers just saying that's a lot of
[03:34:37] you and you know but here's the thing that I only eat one meal that day so technically you know
[03:34:46] but it was it was weakness what is that I do right though so we should add a mulk I should add a mulk
[03:34:53] what if we filled the whole thing here's the thing it was an opportunity it was like what he call it
[03:34:57] one like the bad guys come in at a target of opportunity yeah exactly right up on your mouth
[03:35:03] you got to be by a freaking cupcake oh so I totally did totally did I was doing something in the kitchen
[03:35:09] and there was like a container in the leftovers you know how people when you're younger you're like
[03:35:13] gonna go out with your friends drinking and you do like all we're gonna pre-game ever heard of that
[03:35:19] yes sir hey we're gonna pre-game there's a little hint but a little hint for everybody let's say you're
[03:35:24] going to watch the UFC at your friend's house or you're going to you know your wife's got a friend
[03:35:30] that has some part you know whatever you're going to some unknown realm will you're not sure what's
[03:35:36] gonna be eating pre-game with a mulk pre-game with a mulk that way they show up look they show up with
[03:35:44] you know pizza and instead of eating nine pieces of pizza you just had a mulk you're so correct
[03:35:51] you're so good maybe have apiece you know we're gonna be social either pizza pizza tastes good whatever oh yeah
[03:35:58] so I'd get before back in the day long time ago I'd get I'd order sushi and you know it's sure
[03:36:03] some people in the room don't really aren't really into sushi and I am very much so and I get it when
[03:36:09] I'm like super hungry um next to the sushi spot is a place you can get milkshakes so everyone's
[03:36:15] why I'd get a milkshake too if you drink some of the milkshake before the sushi it's like you're not even
[03:36:21] that hungry for the sushi anymore counterproductive yeah because it's not only is there calories for
[03:36:27] sure but it's like sweet you know what it is actually a great game you accidentally pre-game
[03:36:31] pre-game with the wrong thing that's a well what if it's absolutely true you pre-game with the
[03:36:38] mulk or if you're gonna go out to dinner where it's like hey we're going to this place it's not
[03:36:42] necessarily that hotel you can food yes you're gonna get the chicken parm which is kind of
[03:36:48] you know we're borderline we're brushing up again spares still gonna have some pasta with it which
[03:36:53] so no pre-game yeah pre-game that's what I'm saying both hint for the world but that's a good
[03:36:59] actually really good advice man I do that all the time the other thing you gotta watch out for
[03:37:04] you you go this is another situation hey we're gonna do dinner party you ever go to it like one of
[03:37:09] those the people are on here on top of things right so you show up at five you tell me we're
[03:37:16] going to a dinner party that means we're gonna be eating dinner we show up at five next thing I
[03:37:21] know it's seven o'clock that we have a neat stuff now I'm not happy about the scenario right
[03:37:26] so yeah because guess what it's not that you're not eating because they're putting out freaking
[03:37:31] chips and whatever yeah it's a pre-game yeah pre-game that's what I'm saying pre-game with the mulk
[03:37:38] and I don't want to get too technical though now that I just realized it does it's actually kind of the
[03:37:44] opposite it is a pre-game technically but does the opposite of a drinking pre-game I've always heard
[03:37:49] a pre-game as the drinking yeah oh yeah that's not the only way out in the drinking pre-game you drink
[03:37:55] to get more liquor don't liquor it up you don't drink the milk to get more
[03:38:02] full yes I guess kind of it's a positive pre-game that's what we're talking

[03:40:38] there's weird things happening out there there's people being banned shadow banned
[03:40:44] there's videos being censored which is crazy yeah like we talk about china
[03:40:51] and the fact that they banned parts of the internet and social media they you are not allowed
[03:40:57] and here it is happening here in america all the enough what is the what do you think is like the
[03:41:04] above board not even above board what what is the motive you think and banning someone
[03:41:11] driving a narrative i feel i'm sorry man i feel like someone who's it response i mean i'm
[03:41:16] sure this is a group people who are responsible for that and they're kind of running the
[03:41:20] banning but what is it like what is the conclusion that they come to the be like you know what we
[03:41:25] should really just ban this is just driving a narrative they're driving a narrative and here
[03:41:29] there's there's what sucks is the worst thing you can do to try and drive a narrative is not
[03:41:33] let people talk because if someone has a dumb idea the best thing you could do is let them talk
[03:41:38] about their dumb idea so we can say hey here's your why your idea is dumb what's scariest when
[03:41:43] we let ego get involved and instead of me saying you know what echo's got a opinion
[03:41:46] i'm not sure if he's right or not but i think he's wrong so therefore i'm gonna ban him
[03:41:53] i should be like well echo's got an idea if that idea actually has merit we should bring it
[03:41:57] out in the open we should talk about it and see if it's right or wrong or maybe not necessarily
[03:42:01] right or wrong this is where it's this is what's scary not necessarily right or wrong everyone
[03:42:06] wants everything to be black or white science science isn't black and white science changes
[03:42:13] so when you say something is wrong what how many things are actually wrong not too many
[03:42:22] especially when you have evolving situations whether they're political situations medical situations
[03:42:29] these things evolve and so to just say you know what we're not gonna let you talk about your
[03:42:35] idea is really crazy and it's happening that's why we made the jocca on the ground jocca on

[03:50:06] view on things thanks to him for trying to make a difference and thanks again Stewart sheller for
[03:50:11] your service in the marine court to our country and thanks to all the military personnel
[03:50:17] out there right now trying to make a difference in the world trying to keep it safe for freedom
[03:50:23] by doing what few people will do and the same goes for our police and law enforcement fire fighters
[03:50:29] paramedics and these dispatchers correctional officers board patrol secret service all first responders
[03:50:37] thank you for keeping us safe and protecting freedom here at home
[03:50:44] and everyone else out there there are a lot of forces at work in the world
[03:50:49] a lot of strings being pulled a lot of decisions being made there are agendas and personalities
[03:50:55] and people sometimes look out for their own self interests and that's okay sometimes in most
[03:51:02] cases that's good because when we're all looking out for own self interest then collectively
[03:51:08] we're moving forward but sometimes people's self interest starts to hurt others especially
[03:51:16] from a strategic perspective when people start to look at their own self interest and it helps
[03:51:23] them but it hurts us as a whole from a strategic perspective that's when you may have to step up
[03:51:32] and try and do it tactfully and try and do it through influence and by building relationships
[03:51:37] and by guiding others in the right direction and if none of that works then thanks strategically
[03:51:46] about how to handle your next steps do the calculus don't let your emotions drive your decisions
[03:51:56] think about that indirect approach from be a slid-out heart think about the effectiveness or
[03:52:01] the ineffectiveness of being direct and then make sure you are staying true to your principles
[03:52:10] and what you believe in after all in the end you have to look yourself in the mirror
[03:52:19] and you have to be able to look yourself in the mirror and know that you did the right things
[03:52:25] for the right reasons so move with caution but also with conviction
[03:52:33] until next time Zeko and Jockel out
