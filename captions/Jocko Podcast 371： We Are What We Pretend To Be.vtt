00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.84
This is Jocko podcast number 371 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:07.38 --> 00:00:14.34
We are what we pretend to be so we must be careful of what we pretend to be there's a quote from

3
00:00:14.84 --> 00:00:16.84
curve on again

4
00:00:16.88 --> 00:00:22.38
One of my favorite authors. Ah look that's kind of a weird thing to say because I don't have like this big list of

5
00:00:22.44 --> 00:00:28.92
Favorite authors, sir, but he's one of the authors that I actually do really like a lot

6
00:00:28.92 --> 00:00:36.68
Curve on again born and raised in Indianapolis went to Cornell University got kicked out ROTC because he had bad grades and

7
00:00:37.12 --> 00:00:40.76
He was a little over the top with his satire in the school newspaper

8
00:00:41.48 --> 00:00:43.48
So that kind of tells you what kind of a duty was

9
00:00:43.88 --> 00:00:48.56
But then he didn't want to get drafted so he withdrew from college to go get enlist in the army

10
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:52.52
1943 got captured during the Battle of the Bulge

11
00:00:53.52 --> 00:00:58.000
Prisoner of war in Dresden, of course, this is this I'm just giving you a basic background if you don't know this stuff

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.84
While he was a prisoner of war in Dresden Dresden got fire bombed by the Allied forces

13
00:01:05.68 --> 00:01:15.28
25,000 civilians were killed and the place was just a wasteland and he had survived you they were being held as prisoners of war in

14
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:20.82
This slaughterhouse and he went into like the meat locker of the slaughterhouse

15
00:01:21.96 --> 00:01:23.96
Which is where the book slaughterhouse 5 comes from

16
00:01:23.96 --> 00:01:27.20
Anyways, he survives the war becomes a

17
00:01:28.24 --> 00:01:29.92
reporter

18
00:01:29.92 --> 00:01:33.76
Wrote a bunch of really good books very funny dark humor

19
00:01:34.84 --> 00:01:36.84
Cats cradle book

20
00:01:36.84 --> 00:01:39.12
Welcome to the monkey house slaughterhouse 5. We're starting to talk about

21
00:01:39.76 --> 00:01:47.56
But this quote that he he gave which is we are what we pretend to be so we must be careful of what we pretend to be

22
00:01:49.48 --> 00:01:52.68
It reminds me of this idea that we've been talking about for the last two podcasts

23
00:01:52.68 --> 00:01:59.16
And if you haven't listened to podcast 369 and 370 then just stop and go listen to those first and then catch up here

24
00:01:59.80 --> 00:02:02.44
But we've been talking about this idea of the game

25
00:02:03.16 --> 00:02:07.48
And there's multiple games and you can go get that information from those other two podcasts

26
00:02:08.64 --> 00:02:11.24
Also kind of reminded me of this idea of

27
00:02:11.88 --> 00:02:14.60
Sam Harris and I were talking one time and he said

28
00:02:15.16 --> 00:02:17.000
you can't

29
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Pretend to be brave

30
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.40
Because if you're scared and you're like well, I'm really scared, but I'm gonna pretend to be brave

31
00:02:23.40 --> 00:02:26.80
Well, and then you go and do brave stuff. Well, you're not just pretending you're actually brave

32
00:02:28.28 --> 00:02:29.60
But

33
00:02:29.60 --> 00:02:33.64
We have so that's kind of along the same lines somewhat as

34
00:02:34.72 --> 00:02:37.88
Be careful what you're pretending to be because that's what you are and

35
00:02:39.16 --> 00:02:45.72
That's reminded me of what we've been talking about you have to be careful of what game or what games you play

36
00:02:45.72 --> 00:02:47.72
because

37
00:02:47.72 --> 00:02:49.72
you

38
00:02:49.80 --> 00:02:52.52
Can quite possibly become those games

39
00:02:53.48 --> 00:02:56.92
More importantly the game that you play can become your life

40
00:02:58.12 --> 00:03:02.44
So we did those last two podcasts about this 369 370

41
00:03:03.48 --> 00:03:06.36
And we were getting a bunch of feedback and questions and

42
00:03:07.40 --> 00:03:09.40
Comments and whatnot and so

43
00:03:09.88 --> 00:03:14.12
I reached out on social media on the interwebs to get some get some of those questions

44
00:03:14.12 --> 00:03:16.92
Get some of that feedback on those two podcasts and I want to go through those

45
00:03:17.80 --> 00:03:22.52
Now just because a bunch of people want, you know, we had had some stones. We didn't turn over yet

46
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:25.08
Had some angles we hadn't seen

47
00:03:25.56 --> 00:03:28.28
So first one out of the gate from sarah Armstrong

48
00:03:28.92 --> 00:03:30.76
What's up sarah? I'm strong

49
00:03:30.76 --> 00:03:32.36
she said

50
00:03:32.36 --> 00:03:34.36
observation

51
00:03:34.36 --> 00:03:36.36
if your win

52
00:03:36.44 --> 00:03:42.76
Involves the participation of other people make sure you are not setting yourself up for disappointment by setting

53
00:03:42.76 --> 00:03:45.08
unrealistic expectations for others

54
00:03:46.20 --> 00:03:48.20
Yes, this is true

55
00:03:48.28 --> 00:03:50.12
this is factual

56
00:03:50.12 --> 00:03:55.32
We did a early podcast where I talked about the fact that I don't have a bunch of high expectations for other people

57
00:03:55.48 --> 00:03:56.52
Yeah

58
00:03:56.52 --> 00:03:59.64
Because if you said other people with a bunch of high expectations, you're counting on them

59
00:03:59.72 --> 00:04:01.56
It's there's a decent chance you're gonna get let down

60
00:04:02.44 --> 00:04:04.44
And why do that?

61
00:04:04.60 --> 00:04:09.88
Why not take ownership of what's going on yourself? So that's my recommendation

62
00:04:09.88 --> 00:04:16.12
And sarah armstrong is right here. We can't you can't count on others

63
00:04:17.16 --> 00:04:19.56
Look, they can be part of the plan, but you better have a backup

64
00:04:20.04 --> 00:04:24.12
And you better you better not have a single point of failure be relying on some other human

65
00:04:25.32 --> 00:04:29.48
Because you're there's a decent chance you're setting yourself up as sarah says for disappointment

66
00:04:30.76 --> 00:04:34.68
So don't expect too much if anything from others someone else next one

67
00:04:35.40 --> 00:04:36.92
this is from

68
00:04:36.92 --> 00:04:38.92
from Bizzle fitness

69
00:04:38.92 --> 00:04:40.92
I don't know if i'm gonna cover all these weird

70
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.76
handles

71
00:04:42.76 --> 00:04:44.76
That people have different call signs

72
00:04:45.64 --> 00:04:52.04
Uh, really enjoyed these last two. I'd like to hear your thoughts on two related aspects to this pitfalls and opportunity costs

73
00:04:52.04 --> 00:04:54.84
That's number one and two balancing multiple games

74
00:04:55.72 --> 00:05:02.28
Easy example the folks that get old and either wish they had worked less or spent more time with their family or those

75
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:06.60
On other extreme who wish they had done more with their lives. Yeah, there you go

76
00:05:06.60 --> 00:05:09.72
So first for the pitfalls

77
00:05:10.60 --> 00:05:12.60
and opportunity costs

78
00:05:13.40 --> 00:05:15.40
And as I went through these

79
00:05:16.60 --> 00:05:18.60
We're gonna come into

80
00:05:19.48 --> 00:05:24.76
We're gonna start hitting into a common theme and a lot of these questions and that is

81
00:05:25.88 --> 00:05:27.88
investment and return on investment

82
00:05:28.36 --> 00:05:30.04
right so

83
00:05:30.04 --> 00:05:31.56
A pitfall

84
00:05:31.56 --> 00:05:34.20
And any game that you play is you can lose

85
00:05:34.20 --> 00:05:40.60
So when you get on the field or you engage in a game, there's a chance you're gonna lose

86
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.84
So what that means is you have to be careful with what you invest into that game

87
00:05:45.56 --> 00:05:53.24
And you have to head your bets and you have to have contingency plans now. What's interesting about this is like the whole idea of

88
00:05:54.76 --> 00:05:56.76
Like 100 commitment

89
00:05:57.40 --> 00:05:59.40
Which is sort of a

90
00:06:00.28 --> 00:06:02.28
Like do you hear this about seal training?

91
00:06:02.28 --> 00:06:08.12
Like you better have to have no backup plan or officer and a gentleman your officer

92
00:06:08.76 --> 00:06:10.76
No, please

93
00:06:10.76 --> 00:06:12.76
I got nothing else

94
00:06:12.84 --> 00:06:13.72
That's

95
00:06:13.72 --> 00:06:16.12
Kind of a positive thing like I have no backup plan

96
00:06:16.28 --> 00:06:21.32
Oh, I'm gonna start a business and I'm just I'm putting everything every every penny I have into it

97
00:06:21.72 --> 00:06:25.48
And if it fails, I'm just done. I'm gonna be in the streets. Right?

98
00:06:26.36 --> 00:06:28.36
And therefore I'm gonna

99
00:06:28.36 --> 00:06:30.36
Go extra hard to make it work

100
00:06:30.36 --> 00:06:34.28
If you have to do that to yourself psychologically, okay

101
00:06:36.60 --> 00:06:38.92
If you don't have to do that to yourself psychologically

102
00:06:40.04 --> 00:06:42.04
and you can set yourself up to

103
00:06:42.60 --> 00:06:48.36
Have a backup plan if through your primary plan like seal training. There's a decent chance that you're not gonna make it through it

104
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:53.56
Because you got hurt because you got injured because you got sick because you didn't you thought you were tougher than you are and you quit

105
00:06:54.52 --> 00:06:56.68
All those things happen. They happen to 80 percent of people that go there

106
00:06:56.68 --> 00:07:03.48
So having a backup plan as long as you don't use that as you're out now look if you're gonna use that as you're out

107
00:07:03.48 --> 00:07:06.68
Yeah, it's gonna let you down if you're gonna work hard in your business

108
00:07:06.68 --> 00:07:09.72
But at the end of the day, you're like, you know what I can still just go back to my old job

109
00:07:09.80 --> 00:07:10.76
And I still have my house

110
00:07:10.76 --> 00:07:14.52
So I'm just gonna go back to my old job and go move back and just continue on

111
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.20
As opposed to being like no, I'm gonna gut through it because I have no nowhere else to go

112
00:07:18.52 --> 00:07:20.52
You can see the dichotomy there. Yeah

113
00:07:21.72 --> 00:07:25.40
I would hope that you have the internal fortitude

114
00:07:25.40 --> 00:07:30.20
To push on and not just hit the escape hatch. It comes up, right?

115
00:07:31.16 --> 00:07:33.16
What did I heard somewhere to experiment?

116
00:07:34.04 --> 00:07:36.04
I forget where I heard it

117
00:07:36.20 --> 00:07:39.64
Like they were drowning. Was this at Jordan Peterson the other night?

118
00:07:40.12 --> 00:07:47.000
They were drowning if you take a chicken or they or a rabbit or something and they would drown it

119
00:07:48.52 --> 00:07:50.52
and

120
00:07:50.52 --> 00:07:56.44
They would hold it they would make it tread water. That's what it was. They would make a rabbit tread water

121
00:07:56.76 --> 00:08:01.88
And I heard this on a podcast or something. I think I think oh anyways, I heard on a podcast

122
00:08:02.76 --> 00:08:04.76
You take the the rabbit

123
00:08:05.16 --> 00:08:09.48
And you put it in the water or a rat. I think there's a rat you put in the rat in the water

124
00:08:09.88 --> 00:08:13.40
And it can tread water and it treads water trying to live trying to live trying to live

125
00:08:14.04 --> 00:08:16.52
And then right as it goes under for the last time

126
00:08:17.40 --> 00:08:19.40
You pull it out of the water

127
00:08:19.40 --> 00:08:21.40
and

128
00:08:21.40 --> 00:08:23.40
That takes about 15 minutes

129
00:08:25.40 --> 00:08:28.04
And then if you do it with those same rats again

130
00:08:28.92 --> 00:08:32.68
They'll tread water for like it was something like 60 hours

131
00:08:33.80 --> 00:08:37.16
Because they think at any minute they're gonna get pulled out of the water

132
00:08:37.96 --> 00:08:42.36
But if you take a fresh rat, it's still only going to make it 15 minutes. So

133
00:08:43.56 --> 00:08:48.36
If you if you have the type of personality where you're just going to give up and go back to the easy way

134
00:08:48.36 --> 00:08:54.92
Then I get it. You know, I don't maybe you don't have a a backup plan because you want to trap yourself where you have to keep going forward

135
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.44
That's a real thing man. That's a real thing wait to that rat

136
00:09:01.56 --> 00:09:08.28
Experiment what did that? What was that conclusion there that like if you got some hope you're just gonna hang on till yeah

137
00:09:08.36 --> 00:09:10.36
Hope will make you hang on

138
00:09:10.36 --> 00:09:15.40
Hope will make you hang on that's crazy. Yeah, it is. Yeah, but it totally makes sense, right?

139
00:09:15.40 --> 00:09:19.08
Yeah, and almost at the same time, which is like equally if not more significant

140
00:09:19.08 --> 00:09:22.92
The lack of hope will make you just be like, hey, I'm kind of done 10 minutes, bro

141
00:09:23.16 --> 00:09:28.28
Like there ain't no getting out of this. Yeah, like you literally have plenty of energy left to stick it out for

142
00:09:28.44 --> 00:09:31.64
You know, however long but the lack of hope just pushes you right under. Yeah

143
00:09:32.44 --> 00:09:35.000
So uh to be honest with you

144
00:09:36.36 --> 00:09:39.32
My my lean is towards like yeah, you should have contingency plans

145
00:09:40.04 --> 00:09:42.44
You should have backup plans. You should head your bets

146
00:09:42.44 --> 00:09:47.16
You should say, oh, yeah, I'm gonna try this new business, but I'm not gonna quit my old job until I've got it up and running

147
00:09:48.60 --> 00:09:53.80
Now there's probably a subset of people that can't do that and they're like the rat

148
00:09:54.36 --> 00:09:58.04
That just is gonna give up after 15 minutes. You know what I mean? And they're just done

149
00:09:58.20 --> 00:10:02.68
Yeah, don't you feel that like if you do if you draw the parallel like whereas someone I don't know

150
00:10:02.68 --> 00:10:06.76
What are you talking about like starting a business starting a business? Oh, yeah, I want to leave my job

151
00:10:07.16 --> 00:10:09.16
I'm gonna start a new business. Yeah, so

152
00:10:09.16 --> 00:10:14.76
Basically the equivalent kind of I guess in a way is yeah, you start your new business you buy the website

153
00:10:15.40 --> 00:10:17.40
It's the first step

154
00:10:17.96 --> 00:10:20.28
And then you know, you start it in whatever way

155
00:10:20.76 --> 00:10:22.76
But you hit a roadblock so hardcore

156
00:10:23.32 --> 00:10:26.52
That you don't have that hope you do literally don't see it going anywhere

157
00:10:27.16 --> 00:10:32.36
Like literally in your mind regardless of how it would you know, like that'll that'll kind of do the same thing

158
00:10:32.60 --> 00:10:36.20
It's like, oh, yeah, just drowned just I'm just gonna drown myself because I lost the hope

159
00:10:36.20 --> 00:10:39.88
It's done, you know rather than oh, this is just getting really hard or you know

160
00:10:39.88 --> 00:10:44.44
This obstacle is like it's big and I don't have the energy, you know, it's more about oh, yeah

161
00:10:44.68 --> 00:10:47.000
I don't see it going anywhere already quit your other job

162
00:10:47.96 --> 00:10:51.80
Then maybe that pushes you right maybe you have you you have no other choice

163
00:10:51.88 --> 00:10:55.000
It's a little bit different because it's like you have no other choice. It's not about hope anymore

164
00:10:55.32 --> 00:10:57.48
It's like you have to what else are gonna do. Yeah

165
00:10:58.12 --> 00:11:00.28
So I get it

166
00:11:00.28 --> 00:11:03.88
That is a pitfall is the pitfall of all these different games

167
00:11:03.88 --> 00:11:08.04
Is if you play these games you can lose and that means you need to in my opinion

168
00:11:09.72 --> 00:11:14.92
Don't over invest. This is why we have the iterative decision-making process. This is why we make little steps

169
00:11:15.08 --> 00:11:18.12
We don't just go you know what I want to start my own business quit my job

170
00:11:18.68 --> 00:11:22.44
Give up my health insurance for my family can't pay the rent next month

171
00:11:22.92 --> 00:11:26.76
Whatever, but I'm gonna start my new I'm selling widgets. We're gonna go for it

172
00:11:28.04 --> 00:11:31.32
And you're gonna work hard to sell those widgets because you got a family of feet and you want to pay your mortgage

173
00:11:31.32 --> 00:11:36.12
But guess what there's a chance that that thing it just was a bad plan and no one wants your stupid widgets

174
00:11:36.84 --> 00:11:40.52
And now you're out of a job. You don't have health insurance for your kids. So why not take iterative steps?

175
00:11:42.04 --> 00:11:43.24
Um

176
00:11:43.24 --> 00:11:46.68
The other thing is the opportunity costs for sure

177
00:11:48.92 --> 00:11:55.40
How much can you invest in winning a game right how much can you actually afford what and then what's the roi

178
00:11:55.40 --> 00:12:00.52
When you're playing this game instead of that game. What's the roi on the game that you choose? Yeah

179
00:12:01.24 --> 00:12:04.44
And is it worth it? What if you win that game? What if you lose that game?

180
00:12:05.08 --> 00:12:07.56
You have to track risk and you have to track roi

181
00:12:09.08 --> 00:12:13.72
There this is stuff that you need to think about you need to think about the risk in the game

182
00:12:14.68 --> 00:12:16.68
And what the roi is

183
00:12:16.92 --> 00:12:18.44
Should you win?

184
00:12:18.44 --> 00:12:20.92
And then what the cost is should you lose?

185
00:12:20.92 --> 00:12:24.68
And this is to do with anything look what we're talking about the game. This is anything

186
00:12:25.24 --> 00:12:29.96
Anything that you are planning on doing you're planning on getting in a relationship. Okay, cool. What's the roi?

187
00:12:30.52 --> 00:12:32.52
What's the risk?

188
00:12:32.52 --> 00:12:37.16
Oh, she comes from a great background. She's got a squared away education. She comes from a stable family

189
00:12:37.40 --> 00:12:40.28
She's got a very even temperament. Okay, cool

190
00:12:41.40 --> 00:12:44.44
That sounds pretty positive when you start seeing red flags in there

191
00:12:45.24 --> 00:12:48.44
Now you know you start saying okay. Well, there's some risk here. There's some risk there

192
00:12:48.44 --> 00:12:50.44
So think about those things

193
00:12:51.80 --> 00:12:54.20
And make logical decisions, but

194
00:12:55.24 --> 00:12:59.32
When you make logical decisions, you still have to put emotions into the calculus

195
00:12:59.96 --> 00:13:05.08
Because if you're doing if you're if you're gonna start this new business and you're totally passionate about it and you love it

196
00:13:06.04 --> 00:13:10.12
And you might make less money, but you're you love doing it

197
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
That might be better

198
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
then

199
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
You have to think about it

200
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.84
You you're making more money, but you hate your freaking life. You hate your job 12 hours a day you hate

201
00:13:24.28 --> 00:13:27.64
So you have to take emotions and put them into the calculus

202
00:13:30.04 --> 00:13:36.92
So there you go that the other question there was how to balance multiple games that we're all playing well prioritize next year, right

203
00:13:38.20 --> 00:13:42.04
And again, what's the roi and the risk per game in all these different games?

204
00:13:42.04 --> 00:13:46.76
There's some games that you really have to pay attention to

205
00:13:48.44 --> 00:13:50.44
What do you want?

206
00:13:50.52 --> 00:13:52.52
What do you actually want?

207
00:13:54.36 --> 00:13:57.80
What is actually going to give you fulfillment?

208
00:13:59.64 --> 00:14:02.28
And you can't lie to yourself because there's people that lie to themselves

209
00:14:03.56 --> 00:14:05.56
About what's going to make them happy

210
00:14:05.56 --> 00:14:11.48
About what is going to give them fulfillment and if you lie to yourself for

211
00:14:12.04 --> 00:14:17.88
Throughout your life if that's when you end up on your death bed to the again going back to a busy fitness's question

212
00:14:18.12 --> 00:14:22.44
That's when you go to your death bed and you're like man. I didn't care about all this money or man

213
00:14:22.44 --> 00:14:24.52
I didn't care about what you know this

214
00:14:25.32 --> 00:14:26.84
uh

215
00:14:26.84 --> 00:14:32.04
Going up the chain of command and some in the military or in some company or getting you know

216
00:14:32.04 --> 00:14:36.36
I invested all my time into jujitsu and like I knew I wasn't going to be a champion. I wasted all whatever

217
00:14:36.52 --> 00:14:38.52
I don't know what it is

218
00:14:38.52 --> 00:14:40.52
Seems like a hard one

219
00:14:41.08 --> 00:14:45.48
But you know, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, it's true. There's people that there's people that reach a point in jujitsu

220
00:14:45.48 --> 00:14:48.84
Where they're like, oh, you know, I I don't want to do this anymore. Yeah, that happens

221
00:14:49.24 --> 00:14:53.000
Yeah, yeah fully and I guess it with

222
00:14:53.56 --> 00:14:57.40
jujitsu I felt like and there's I went through mental stuff like that too where

223
00:14:58.28 --> 00:15:00.28
I felt like there was a whole reason

224
00:15:00.28 --> 00:15:01.88
that I

225
00:15:01.88 --> 00:15:03.88
liked jujitsu is like

226
00:15:03.88 --> 00:15:08.92
To be able to get into a competition like in almost like a combat sport and win

227
00:15:09.32 --> 00:15:11.24
It made me feel good about myself kind of a thing

228
00:15:11.88 --> 00:15:16.84
And then after like a few, you know, like years of control with the psychological reveal

229
00:15:18.52 --> 00:15:21.32
But after years of competing and then when I got into like

230
00:15:22.12 --> 00:15:27.72
My career and then eventually kind of got married or whatever. I was like wait you kind of got married

231
00:15:27.72 --> 00:15:31.72
I'm gonna give you a chance to say that correctly

232
00:15:32.20 --> 00:15:34.20
So that we don't get any

233
00:15:34.20 --> 00:15:36.20
I was gonna say the person that you kind of got married to

234
00:15:36.84 --> 00:15:40.20
I was gonna say I kind of got um other

235
00:15:40.84 --> 00:15:45.16
Responsibility so to speak even though like jujitsu is the responsibility. That's why I say kind of anyway

236
00:15:45.72 --> 00:15:49.48
You get married start having like kids and stuff. It puts it into perspective like hey

237
00:15:50.04 --> 00:15:53.24
Sure, I'm always gonna go to jujitsu, but why don't I feel the same way?

238
00:15:53.24 --> 00:15:57.96
And I'm like, oh wait it puts into perspective. They're more important things than winning jujitsu tournaments

239
00:15:58.44 --> 00:16:00.44
So you looked at the ROI

240
00:16:01.16 --> 00:16:05.80
Of you know training seven days a week three hours a day

241
00:16:06.68 --> 00:16:09.000
And you and the and the ROI of

242
00:16:09.56 --> 00:16:14.12
Investing time and effort into your family and the ROI of investing time and effort into your career

243
00:16:15.08 --> 00:16:20.04
And this is exactly what we're talking about. You had to prioritize an execute. You know what seven days a week three hours a day

244
00:16:20.04 --> 00:16:24.60
And my ROI on that is I'll feel good about a competition

245
00:16:25.40 --> 00:16:30.20
But the ROI of investing in my career is I can get money. I can get stability

246
00:16:30.20 --> 00:16:32.60
I can take care of my family and by the way, that's the other thing my family

247
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.96
There's the ROI of you know raising my kids and the smile on my wife's face all those things and you weigh those out

248
00:16:40.60 --> 00:16:42.60
And you were honest with yourself

249
00:16:42.84 --> 00:16:45.40
And you prioritize those things in the correct way

250
00:16:45.40 --> 00:16:51.000
So that when you're on your death bed, you're not like man, I really wish I would have trained jujitsu more or you're like

251
00:16:51.72 --> 00:16:55.80
Boy, I'm glad I won that tournament. Yeah, you know, even though my wife left me

252
00:16:56.36 --> 00:17:02.84
And my kids don't know me. I'm really happy. I won that tournament and I got a coral belt in jujitsu when I was 68

253
00:17:06.20 --> 00:17:10.68
Yeah, that was that was kind of the thought really where it went through this

254
00:17:11.56 --> 00:17:13.56
You went through this

255
00:17:13.56 --> 00:17:15.56
With your

256
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:17.24
With with these things in your life

257
00:17:17.24 --> 00:17:22.04
You actually did this protocol and we talked about this we talked about that being honest with yourself

258
00:17:22.04 --> 00:17:29.48
That was sort of the underlying theme of I think 370 the the last one was like you have to be honest with yourself

259
00:17:29.96 --> 00:17:31.80
about these games

260
00:17:31.80 --> 00:17:34.52
And in this podcast as I read through these questions

261
00:17:34.84 --> 00:17:37.72
The specific thing is you need to be honest yourself about

262
00:17:38.28 --> 00:17:40.92
The investment you're willing to make and what the return is

263
00:17:40.92 --> 00:17:45.40
And is it worth it and is it what you really want? Yeah, because if it's not

264
00:17:46.84 --> 00:17:50.68
You know, I've seen this happen with fighters too like fighters reach a certain point where

265
00:17:51.48 --> 00:17:53.88
They say, you know what? I mean like I just

266
00:17:54.84 --> 00:17:56.84
I'm I don't want to do

267
00:17:57.40 --> 00:18:03.24
Eight-week camps where I can't see my family and God or whatever happens with people in the military. They're like, you know what?

268
00:18:03.24 --> 00:18:07.16
I've I've done my 10 years. I'm not committed to the job anymore

269
00:18:07.24 --> 00:18:10.36
I don't want to do it anymore and they get out and they move on to something else the ROI

270
00:18:10.36 --> 00:18:13.48
They have to be honest with themselves. I've also seen people lie to themselves

271
00:18:13.88 --> 00:18:17.72
Yeah, about these types of things and by the time they get out

272
00:18:18.44 --> 00:18:19.88
Of the military

273
00:18:19.88 --> 00:18:24.52
They realize that they were pursuing something because they were basically caught in that ecosystem

274
00:18:24.52 --> 00:18:27.64
We talked about that on one of the other podcasts like man. That's so true

275
00:18:27.96 --> 00:18:29.96
The other thing that weighs into this like

276
00:18:30.36 --> 00:18:33.32
Just to just to kind of get precise on what you just said

277
00:18:33.88 --> 00:18:39.000
You knew you actually weren't going to be better than everyone at jujitsu. You weren't you weren't going to be the world champion

278
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.24
No, you're gonna be good. You're gonna be good at a particular you'd be in the top three or five in in a gym

279
00:18:45.88 --> 00:18:48.68
You weren't going to be the number one even in that particular gym

280
00:18:48.76 --> 00:18:53.24
And you definitely weren't going to be number one in the state of california or certainly not in the world

281
00:18:53.72 --> 00:18:55.72
If you would have had that maybe potential

282
00:18:56.20 --> 00:19:00.28
Now all of a sudden the ROI becomes oh, it's a little better ROI. I can actually be a champion

283
00:19:00.28 --> 00:19:04.28
I can actually start a school. I can have a whatever you can make a living from it now

284
00:19:04.28 --> 00:19:07.64
There's other things that come out of it. You you weren't in that situation. Oh, yeah

285
00:19:07.64 --> 00:19:11.24
So and that's a good point because you don't really well then again, I don't know

286
00:19:11.24 --> 00:19:12.12
I can only speak for myself

287
00:19:12.12 --> 00:19:14.12
but I didn't really think about that

288
00:19:15.08 --> 00:19:18.92
Until I got my eyes kind of opened where I'm like, oh wait, there's all this other stuff that I can be like

289
00:19:19.80 --> 00:19:23.16
Kind of I could see a path to legitimate success over here

290
00:19:23.16 --> 00:19:27.000
But then in jujitsu if I even like think about it like that which I never really did

291
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.96
I just was like I liked training and winning and then doing the tournament or whatever

292
00:19:30.28 --> 00:19:33.80
But then if I look at like a more a long-term path, you're right. I was like, yeah

293
00:19:33.80 --> 00:19:39.72
I'm not even close to these like the real dudes, you know, so I'm like, oh, why would I do this?

294
00:19:39.72 --> 00:19:42.76
Nice thing about having Dean Lister in a gym. We're like, bro, this guy

295
00:19:43.56 --> 00:19:46.44
And Dean Lister, you know, he was number one in the world at certain times

296
00:19:46.44 --> 00:19:50.28
But a lot of times he's getting beat by other guys. So you're thinking well, this guy's destroying me

297
00:19:51.08 --> 00:19:53.08
So where am I? I'm gonna be like

298
00:19:53.88 --> 00:19:59.40
Third or fourth or fifth in my gym. Yeah, and keep in mind. I'm in my 30s at this time

299
00:19:59.40 --> 00:20:04.36
Yeah, so let's face it, you know, but the point is I was I didn't my eyes weren't even open to that

300
00:20:04.36 --> 00:20:09.40
It was just like it was part habit part payoff going to the gym and learning cool stuff or whatever

301
00:20:09.40 --> 00:20:10.20
But

302
00:20:10.20 --> 00:20:15.000
Well, you just like how you said that ecosystem you get blinded by just that ecosystem because you're just in it

303
00:20:15.24 --> 00:20:19.16
You know and then so other things open my eyes or whatever and then you can see, you know

304
00:20:19.48 --> 00:20:23.80
for me the jujitsu is just a r the r y on jujitsu is the

305
00:20:23.80 --> 00:20:28.52
Uh personal like the good feeling when I get done training

306
00:20:28.52 --> 00:20:32.76
Yeah, and especially when I kind of go to war like when I'm having wars on the mat

307
00:20:33.48 --> 00:20:36.44
It feels good get done like you just know you pushed

308
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:43.24
Yeah, you you got tapped you tapped whatever doesn't matter, but you you you you struggled you into war

309
00:20:44.04 --> 00:20:45.56
in in

310
00:20:45.56 --> 00:20:46.68
that

311
00:20:46.68 --> 00:20:53.000
Arena which is sense bj pan actually said on this podcast. It's called mine pump. He was on this podcast

312
00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.44
He's uh, he was like I I trained for my mental health and I was like, oh, that's so true because really that's essentially what you said

313
00:21:00.44 --> 00:21:04.28
It's like you go in it's like it's therapy in so many different ways

314
00:21:04.76 --> 00:21:07.48
You it's the kind it's so good. We're like just the activity

315
00:21:08.20 --> 00:21:12.04
And I found that even when I go and I don't have hard training or I do have hard training to me

316
00:21:12.04 --> 00:21:13.16
It's all the same at the end

317
00:21:13.16 --> 00:21:17.64
I mean look if you have a bunch of super duper easy trainings in a in a row and you're like frick

318
00:21:17.64 --> 00:21:21.48
I wish I okay, there's that but you go to jujitsu unless you get injured

319
00:21:21.48 --> 00:21:27.72
Which I had before but if unless you get injured you go home you can feel better 100 even if you really didn't feel like going

320
00:21:27.88 --> 00:21:31.32
Which is a lot of the time, but if you get yourself it's like any workout, you know

321
00:21:31.64 --> 00:21:35.32
But you just as those extra elements of like I don't know something that like

322
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:39.08
Fulfills you or whatever. Yeah, no, they made that

323
00:21:39.80 --> 00:21:43.72
They made that video at origin of my daughter talking about it and she was just like

324
00:21:44.44 --> 00:21:47.48
Once she realized how good it made her feel

325
00:21:47.48 --> 00:21:51.80
Yeah, but mentally that's when she was like, oh, I can I should do this all the time

326
00:21:52.20 --> 00:21:56.36
And it happens when you withdraw from it. You're like, why don't I feel that good? And all of a sudden you do you like oh

327
00:21:56.76 --> 00:21:58.76
Yeah, so that's what I feel like. Yeah

328
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:04.04
So the ROI on that level for me jujitsu. This just this just

329
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.56
Devolved into just a pure jujitsu discussion

330
00:22:08.20 --> 00:22:11.88
But it applies to everything. Yeah, it applies to checking the ROI on the game

331
00:22:11.88 --> 00:22:17.40
Whether that game is you're gonna get focused on getting involved in uh, you know your your

332
00:22:18.92 --> 00:22:21.08
Thing at work like where does it go?

333
00:22:21.80 --> 00:22:25.96
That's someone people get caught up in they get caught up and like, oh, I'm in this job

334
00:22:25.96 --> 00:22:30.04
I'm in this corporation and I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the next level. I'm making the next level

335
00:22:30.60 --> 00:22:36.84
Okay, that's cool as long as that ROI is real as long as you're like, oh

336
00:22:37.32 --> 00:22:39.88
If you're like, hey, I'm just doing this because the pay is great and I can take care of my family

337
00:22:39.88 --> 00:22:44.36
And I'm gonna get promoted and get more money. Okay, cool. Cool work hard and that all works out

338
00:22:45.08 --> 00:22:47.08
If you're thinking, oh, I want to

339
00:22:47.24 --> 00:22:49.24
I want people to call. I want to be the VP

340
00:22:50.04 --> 00:22:52.04
Right. I want to be the EVP

341
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.56
And then you think that's gonna make you feel better and if it does cool, that's fine. That's awesome

342
00:22:57.56 --> 00:23:01.96
Like hey, you rose up you were in a big company. You were running a big department. You had a lot of responsibility

343
00:23:01.96 --> 00:23:03.96
You're taking care of much with that that is totally legit

344
00:23:04.68 --> 00:23:08.60
As long as you're telling yourself the truth if you're lying to yourself. That's when it becomes problematic

345
00:23:08.60 --> 00:23:14.76
That's one thing that's so cool about ash on front is I work with so many different people like there's people that do you can name it

346
00:23:15.40 --> 00:23:16.92
And they're totally into it, man

347
00:23:16.92 --> 00:23:17.96
And it's awesome

348
00:23:17.96 --> 00:23:23.24
Like I want I love to work with people that whatever they're doing whether they're digging ditches

349
00:23:23.48 --> 00:23:28.04
But they're doing it safely and they're doing you know doing huge contracts and it's awesome

350
00:23:28.04 --> 00:23:33.000
They're running big companies and it's cool. They love doing that stuff or they're you know

351
00:23:33.72 --> 00:23:36.12
making a product or they're

352
00:23:36.12 --> 00:23:38.68
Providing a service, but they're into it

353
00:23:39.64 --> 00:23:41.64
They're in the right game

354
00:23:42.04 --> 00:23:48.36
And I hope that if you're listening you can do an honest assessment of yourself and make sure that that game that you're in

355
00:23:48.76 --> 00:23:50.60
Is the right game for you

356
00:23:50.60 --> 00:23:52.12
And if you're doing something that you say

357
00:23:52.12 --> 00:23:56.28
Oh, I don't care about my clients if you don't care about the people you're that you're serving

358
00:23:56.76 --> 00:23:59.24
Or you're providing services from that's not a good indicator

359
00:23:59.64 --> 00:24:04.20
If you're working with people you don't really like or you don't really want to take care of that's not a good indicator

360
00:24:04.20 --> 00:24:09.72
So be honest with yourself and make sure that the game that you're in from a work perspective is the right game

361
00:24:10.68 --> 00:24:14.36
That's a lot more common problem than I'm into a

362
00:24:14.84 --> 00:24:17.80
You know Jiu Jitsu is an example, but any hobby that you're into

363
00:24:18.44 --> 00:24:20.44
Like you invest a bunch of money into

364
00:24:21.48 --> 00:24:23.16
archery

365
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:27.16
You wouldn't invest a bunch of money unless it was unless you liked it unless the ROI was good

366
00:24:27.56 --> 00:24:30.28
So the hobbies are a little bit easier to just I'm not going to do that

367
00:24:30.28 --> 00:24:34.20
Yeah, actually the hobbies are the opposite where you should be doing it, but you're not

368
00:24:35.32 --> 00:24:37.80
You know you you you know you should be training Jiu Jitsu

369
00:24:37.80 --> 00:24:38.84
You know you should be lifting weights

370
00:24:38.84 --> 00:24:43.40
You know you should be running or do whatever thing it is because you know it makes you feel good, but you say, you know

371
00:24:45.88 --> 00:24:51.24
Right you forget about the ROI you forget about the return you only think about the investment

372
00:24:51.32 --> 00:24:55.24
Well, you know, I got to get up early and do this before I go to work and that's kind of a pain

373
00:24:55.24 --> 00:25:01.32
You only you focus on the investment. You don't focus on the return the return is your health and that's what you should focus

374
00:25:01.56 --> 00:25:02.60
That's why

375
00:25:02.60 --> 00:25:07.56
Measuring the investment and measuring the return on investment of what you do in the game whatever game it is

376
00:25:07.96 --> 00:25:10.04
That's why I'm trying to get you to pay attention to them

377
00:25:12.36 --> 00:25:13.72
All right

378
00:25:13.72 --> 00:25:18.20
Next one Carter Royce. I guess Carter hoist. Maybe if he's from Brazil

379
00:25:18.68 --> 00:25:24.12
Uh, if everyone on a team has a different overall life game slash goal

380
00:25:24.12 --> 00:25:28.76
How do you work to align these different perspectives into one that benefits the overall team?

381
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And this is work relationships community

382
00:25:31.72 --> 00:25:33.88
Here's the here's the cool thing about this

383
00:25:35.56 --> 00:25:37.32
Living well

384
00:25:37.32 --> 00:25:39.32
Doing good and helping each other

385
00:25:39.96 --> 00:25:42.76
Generally speaking helps helps ourselves as well

386
00:25:43.64 --> 00:25:45.64
It generally so when you're talking about

387
00:25:46.28 --> 00:25:51.08
Interacting with other people whether it's at work whether it's in your family whether it's in your community if you help other people

388
00:25:51.08 --> 00:25:53.08
It's going to help you

389
00:25:53.08 --> 00:25:58.12
And if everyone recognizes that then we're all aligned so if

390
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:01.40
If I help echo

391
00:26:01.64 --> 00:26:03.64
If if you and I work together

392
00:26:04.84 --> 00:26:09.56
And if you work hard and so you provide a good service to our clients

393
00:26:11.32 --> 00:26:16.44
I benefit you benefit I benefit and we both know that at actual on front

394
00:26:16.84 --> 00:26:19.08
Okay, so take actual on front. We got a bunch of instructors there

395
00:26:19.08 --> 00:26:25.72
The better each individual instructor does right the better jp does the better laif does the better. I do

396
00:26:26.28 --> 00:26:29.24
The better Dave does the better each individual instructor does

397
00:26:30.36 --> 00:26:33.96
Providing the service for the client the better that individual does

398
00:26:34.84 --> 00:26:36.84
And the better actual on front does

399
00:26:36.84 --> 00:26:41.32
Because people call back say we want jp to come again. We have he's great. We want him to come and do a four-day workshop

400
00:26:41.32 --> 00:26:43.08
Like that's what happens

401
00:26:43.08 --> 00:26:49.88
So guess what jp makes more money actual on front makes more money the client gets taken care of so

402
00:26:50.60 --> 00:26:52.60
That's the way it is with

403
00:26:53.56 --> 00:26:55.56
Most in your family

404
00:26:55.72 --> 00:26:57.72
oh your

405
00:26:57.72 --> 00:27:04.20
Your kid is you take you you get your kid to study, you know, you talk to explain to them the why they study hard

406
00:27:04.36 --> 00:27:06.36
They get better grades. They get better grades

407
00:27:07.08 --> 00:27:12.12
That's beneficial not just for you. You'd be like, hey, my kid's a straight a student, right? You get the brag cool

408
00:27:12.12 --> 00:27:14.12
Yeah, but also your kid gets a better life

409
00:27:14.92 --> 00:27:17.08
They get into a better school. They get a better job

410
00:27:17.64 --> 00:27:22.76
All that stuff happens the family's doing better because now I don't have to rely my kid's not relying on me for that

411
00:27:23.08 --> 00:27:27.24
For that, you know kicking down some some money because they don't have a good job

412
00:27:29.08 --> 00:27:35.08
How does alignment roll into that because like how he's asking like everyone has a different overall gaming goal

413
00:27:36.68 --> 00:27:38.68
Well, what I'm saying is

414
00:27:38.68 --> 00:27:45.24
If you're part of a team because he's talking about an individual team whether that team is a family a company if

415
00:27:46.04 --> 00:27:48.04
We you know at my family

416
00:27:48.20 --> 00:27:53.64
If I say hey, listen, we got to do a better job with not spending so much money

417
00:27:53.80 --> 00:27:58.92
We're wasting money on this we're wasting money on that people are going buying a cup of coffee that costs three dollars

418
00:27:58.92 --> 00:28:00.92
It's it's hurting us

419
00:28:01.72 --> 00:28:03.000
We need to tighten it up

420
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.48
So when I say that to the whole family the whole family realize oh, I need to spend less money. Guess what we end up with more

421
00:28:10.20 --> 00:28:13.56
Financial security because we're not wasting a bunch of money and that means we can

422
00:28:14.20 --> 00:28:18.52
You know get that new roof that we need because our roof is leaking. Yeah, like this is what happens

423
00:28:19.32 --> 00:28:23.08
So when you're all working together, it's very rare

424
00:28:24.04 --> 00:28:26.04
That's something that helps the individual

425
00:28:27.08 --> 00:28:29.08
Doesn't help the team

426
00:28:29.16 --> 00:28:30.84
right

427
00:28:30.84 --> 00:28:33.80
Because because then what why are you part of why is there a team?

428
00:28:34.20 --> 00:28:36.84
Yeah teams are meant to achieve a goal

429
00:28:37.64 --> 00:28:41.96
Whether that's a business whether that's a family whether that's a sports team

430
00:28:43.80 --> 00:28:46.92
You know if if echo if you and I are part of the same company

431
00:28:47.72 --> 00:28:52.76
And you and I are supposed to make widgets and you make 10 a day and I only make five a day

432
00:28:54.04 --> 00:28:59.80
The fact that you made more than me is actually good for you because you're going to get your bonus, but it's also good for me

433
00:28:59.80 --> 00:29:01.80
I don't want to like undermine you

434
00:29:02.92 --> 00:29:09.56
Because then all of a sudden we're not getting as many of our widgets made and now we don't have as many to sell and now some other

435
00:29:10.12 --> 00:29:15.40
Place can come in and get a market share from us and that's a problem. Yeah, so for this

436
00:29:16.92 --> 00:29:23.40
When you when you climb the ladder of alignment, which I talk about a lot at echelon front

437
00:29:23.40 --> 00:29:29.16
You and I might be competing to make widgets right you you you and I are getting a bonus based on how many we make

438
00:29:29.16 --> 00:29:32.68
And whoever makes more gets a better bonus. We're competing

439
00:29:33.16 --> 00:29:35.16
Yeah, but as soon as we go up one level

440
00:29:36.20 --> 00:29:38.20
Up the up the ladder of alignment

441
00:29:38.76 --> 00:29:40.28
And I say

442
00:29:40.28 --> 00:29:44.44
Hey, I don't want to actually like steal some of your parts for your widget

443
00:29:44.44 --> 00:29:48.04
So you can't make as many or so your widgets don't meet the quality

444
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:53.40
And now someone out in the marketplace buys it and it doesn't work right and now they complain to put it on yelp and now our sales go down

445
00:29:53.96 --> 00:29:59.000
So when you go up and say hey look even though we're competing against each other see you can make more widgets

446
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:01.72
and still maintain quality

447
00:30:02.28 --> 00:30:05.24
Even though we're competing against each other if you go up one level

448
00:30:05.48 --> 00:30:10.92
We're actually working together because if we provide good widgets and we make a lot of them

449
00:30:10.92 --> 00:30:14.60
There'll be more to sell we can lower the price a little bit which means we can sell even more

450
00:30:14.60 --> 00:30:16.60
We can drive some other people to sell them

451
00:30:16.60 --> 00:30:20.20
We can sell even more we can drive some other people out of the market like that's what's happening

452
00:30:20.60 --> 00:30:26.28
Yeah, so climb the ladder of alignment a little bit go to a higher place where it's like oh

453
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
We are on the same team. Yeah

454
00:30:29.96 --> 00:30:31.96
I always listen to that when you say

455
00:30:32.28 --> 00:30:34.44
Climb the ladder of alignment because you know people

456
00:30:35.08 --> 00:30:38.76
That's like one of the main questions that people ask you in my when I mean in my experience

457
00:30:38.84 --> 00:30:43.56
I'm like, hey, what do you do when we're not aligned and this person has little separate agendas, right?

458
00:30:43.56 --> 00:30:48.20
And so I'm thinking wait a second. Yeah, that's obviously a common problem

459
00:30:48.28 --> 00:30:51.80
So why is it always that's like not that simple, but why is it always?

460
00:30:52.76 --> 00:30:55.56
Like you always have that same solution and it makes perfect sense

461
00:30:55.56 --> 00:31:01.80
So I'm still thinking why the hell is it still a problem like that much because people mistake agendas for alignment

462
00:31:02.52 --> 00:31:05.32
They mistake the fact that you and I are competing

463
00:31:06.20 --> 00:31:07.88
To who can make more widgets?

464
00:31:07.88 --> 00:31:15.000
They mistake that fact that we're competing and we're actually trying to go against each other with the fact that if you go up

465
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.32
A few levels we're actually both trying to do the same thing and move in the same direction

466
00:31:19.56 --> 00:31:20.44
Yeah

467
00:31:20.44 --> 00:31:25.88
Yeah, I've realized slowly but surely the jam up comes when

468
00:31:27.08 --> 00:31:33.72
Someone invokes their short-term agenda at the expense of the long-term agenda even for themselves

469
00:31:33.72 --> 00:31:37.72
And by the way and when that happens, so I steal some of your parts

470
00:31:38.04 --> 00:31:42.12
Yeah, and I mess them up and I put them back in your bucket of the widgets you're assembling

471
00:31:42.28 --> 00:31:47.40
Yeah, so I can look better. You can look so I look better. Yeah, and all someone needs to do is pull me aside and say

472
00:31:47.40 --> 00:31:50.52
Hey, jocco, we got you know, we saw that we saw what you did

473
00:31:52.68 --> 00:31:54.60
Let me ask you this jocco if you know

474
00:31:54.60 --> 00:31:58.04
Someone buys one of the parts that echo made one of the widgets that echo made it doesn't work

475
00:31:58.04 --> 00:32:02.92
What's that going to do to our reputation? Oh now they're gonna want not going to want to buy the ones that you made either

476
00:32:02.92 --> 00:32:04.12
Oh

477
00:32:04.12 --> 00:32:06.12
Now we're not selling as many of these things

478
00:32:06.20 --> 00:32:09.56
Oh now in order to cover our margin. We got to raise our prices

479
00:32:09.64 --> 00:32:15.48
Oh now that we've raised our prices the competitor comes in and is looking even better with an even lower price. Oh

480
00:32:15.96 --> 00:32:20.20
We're getting driven. See what I'm saying. All you have to do is pull the thread on it and you realize that

481
00:32:21.64 --> 00:32:26.76
Occasion it's so rare and usually this what I say it's so rare that people are actually not aligned

482
00:32:26.76 --> 00:32:32.60
Yeah, once you go high enough look we can be aligned even in a seal platoon. It's like you have you have seth in in

483
00:32:33.24 --> 00:32:36.92
Delta platoon and laif and charlie platoon. They're competitive against each other

484
00:32:37.48 --> 00:32:44.04
You know, they both want we only got you know seven of the new weapon sites the new high speed weapon sites

485
00:32:44.12 --> 00:32:46.12
They want some all seth wants them all

486
00:32:47.72 --> 00:32:49.72
And if they're gonna steal them from each other

487
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.28
That's bad

488
00:32:52.28 --> 00:32:55.80
But if I say hey guys, who's got a mission that more requires these sites

489
00:32:55.80 --> 00:32:57.80
Yeah, and laif's like well, you know

490
00:32:58.36 --> 00:33:02.04
Seth's doing this these patrols over in this area. That's further ranges

491
00:33:02.68 --> 00:33:05.96
He could probably use them. Oh, okay as soon as you go up a level

492
00:33:06.60 --> 00:33:08.60
The problem gets solved

493
00:33:08.84 --> 00:33:10.84
Occasionally very rarely

494
00:33:11.56 --> 00:33:13.08
echo

495
00:33:13.08 --> 00:33:19.08
Actually wants to start his own widget business. Mm-hmm. So he's doing things that legitimately are not aligned

496
00:33:20.12 --> 00:33:23.24
He's making parts that are not he's making widgets that suck

497
00:33:23.24 --> 00:33:26.44
And they're gonna go out in the market. We're gonna have a bad reputation. He's gonna go up

498
00:33:26.44 --> 00:33:31.48
I started to echo his widgets and we make the highest quality. Yeah, so occasionally you can have people that are

499
00:33:32.04 --> 00:33:37.88
Truly not aligned at the top of the linemen ladder of alignment. They're not aligned. This is what I always ask people

500
00:33:38.12 --> 00:33:39.96
I ask companies like, okay

501
00:33:39.96 --> 00:33:44.04
Who here doesn't want the company to be profitable? No one raises their hands

502
00:33:44.44 --> 00:33:47.80
Who here doesn't want to take care of the people on your team? No one raise your hand

503
00:33:47.96 --> 00:33:49.96
Who here doesn't want to take care of your customer?

504
00:33:49.96 --> 00:33:54.36
No one raises their hand. So there all of a sudden everyone's aligned. Everybody wants to make money

505
00:33:54.60 --> 00:33:57.64
Everybody wants to take care of their team and everyone wants to take care of the customers

506
00:33:58.12 --> 00:34:02.28
Everyone's aligned. No one goes like, well, I'd actually like to screw over the customers or like, hey

507
00:34:02.28 --> 00:34:08.36
I actually I actually want my team to to be in a bad bad position or I want the company to lose money

508
00:34:09.08 --> 00:34:11.08
That's not happening. Same thing in war

509
00:34:11.40 --> 00:34:14.84
What do we want to do kill bad guys keep our guys safe and win the war? Okay

510
00:34:15.56 --> 00:34:19.56
Who who here wants to get their guys killed? No one who here doesn't want to kill the bad guys? No one

511
00:34:19.56 --> 00:34:24.76
Who here wants us to lose? No one. So we're aligned. You might be thinking we should attack from this direction

512
00:34:24.76 --> 00:34:26.76
I'm thinking we should attack from a different direction

513
00:34:26.76 --> 00:34:31.88
But one of us is right one of us wrong. It's not that we disagree on what we're trying to achieve

514
00:34:32.04 --> 00:34:34.60
So we're aligned. We just have different ideas

515
00:34:35.88 --> 00:34:36.92
And that's all there is to it

516
00:34:36.92 --> 00:34:40.28
And it's the same thing here when it comes to these various games that we're playing

517
00:34:40.52 --> 00:34:43.80
Yeah, that um and jp tells a good story about this

518
00:34:44.28 --> 00:34:46.92
But that that's a good point where it's like, yeah, you might have two different ideas

519
00:34:46.92 --> 00:34:50.52
But once you kind of realize how aligned you really are you start to be like wait a second

520
00:34:50.52 --> 00:34:53.88
Let's really hash out who has the better idea whether it's you or me or whatever

521
00:34:54.12 --> 00:34:56.12
But it puts it into perspective that much more

522
00:34:56.44 --> 00:35:00.92
So and that's what happened jp according to his story about uh, you guys, you know when he came back

523
00:35:01.16 --> 00:35:05.08
You know, he has all these like important missions and all this like big huge impact

524
00:35:05.08 --> 00:35:08.76
He's maybe he comes back and then he has to be like an instructor which he thought was like

525
00:35:09.40 --> 00:35:14.68
Not that it was like a misuse of his his value or whatever. It was a danger to society

526
00:35:14.68 --> 00:35:17.56
It was a danger to bud students. I can guarantee you that

527
00:35:18.12 --> 00:35:22.12
Freakin jp in ramadi as the lead sniper

528
00:35:22.84 --> 00:35:28.84
And then whatever two weeks later. He's like standing in front of bud students. That's not a good transition period for jp

529
00:35:28.84 --> 00:35:30.84
to know at 22 years

530
00:35:31.24 --> 00:35:35.72
You realize that's literally when I met jp. Oh really like right when he got back. Yeah

531
00:35:35.80 --> 00:35:39.24
That's what I met him for the first time with cake. Where'd you meet him? Oh, it's a tsu shi. Yeah

532
00:35:39.40 --> 00:35:41.40
He was like sure. Okay, but um

533
00:35:41.40 --> 00:35:45.88
But he makes a great point where he's like he was so mad. He even admits like I was so mad

534
00:35:45.96 --> 00:35:49.88
I should be over there doing this. You know killing me and he talks to you one time and you're like, hey

535
00:35:50.28 --> 00:35:52.20
That was your mission then this is your mission now

536
00:35:52.28 --> 00:35:55.16
We're fighting where you're doing this you're gonna train these guys

537
00:35:55.16 --> 00:36:00.36
So we the best you possibly possibly possibly can so they can be good enough to go over and we never have to go to

538
00:36:00.36 --> 00:36:04.36
Freeing ore again. Boom. Just like that. Mm-hmm put back into perspective

539
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.88
Alignment revealed alignment revealed. So there you go

540
00:36:08.52 --> 00:36:10.52
Um, there you go. Carter

541
00:36:10.52 --> 00:36:14.20
Hope that helps next one easy money, dude. Hell yeah

542
00:36:14.92 --> 00:36:16.36
check

543
00:36:16.36 --> 00:36:21.48
How do you identify what games are worth playing or games to avoid again?

544
00:36:22.04 --> 00:36:24.60
This is this is a study in return on investment

545
00:36:25.56 --> 00:36:28.44
Now and it's not just return. It's return on investment

546
00:36:28.52 --> 00:36:32.04
So it's what are you gonna have to put into this thing and what can we possibly get out of it?

547
00:36:32.44 --> 00:36:34.44
And what are the risks involved?

548
00:36:35.56 --> 00:36:37.56
And then you just have to be honest with yourself

549
00:36:37.56 --> 00:36:40.36
Just be honest with yourself. You're looking at some some game

550
00:36:40.92 --> 00:36:45.24
Want to get involved with a girl want to start a new business want to get involved in a club

551
00:36:45.88 --> 00:36:50.04
You know, there's like a you know, rotary club or whatever want to get involved in that thing

552
00:36:51.16 --> 00:36:53.64
Want to get involved in some volunteer organization, whatever it is

553
00:36:54.28 --> 00:36:56.28
What do you have to put into it?

554
00:36:56.28 --> 00:36:58.68
What's the return going to be and what are the risks involved?

555
00:36:59.64 --> 00:37:01.64
And be honest with yourself

556
00:37:01.64 --> 00:37:10.20
Did you know that Seinfeld had nine episodes and they were like at the top of the charts and then he just stopped

557
00:37:10.92 --> 00:37:16.28
Remy had nine episodes or not episode. Sorry nine seasons. Yeah, and it was number one

558
00:37:16.52 --> 00:37:18.92
And he just stopped and they were like what the hell they wanted him

559
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.40
They were gonna pay him crazy amounts of money for a tenth season

560
00:37:22.04 --> 00:37:24.12
So why didn't you do it because of this?

561
00:37:24.36 --> 00:37:29.24
He identified the game worth playing because he looked back. He said i'm not married. I have no kids nothing

562
00:37:29.24 --> 00:37:33.08
All i'm doing is this show no matter how successful it was like that's not worth it anymore

563
00:37:33.16 --> 00:37:38.92
As far as my life the games i'm playing there you go. Perfect example. He had to look at it. He's got this game

564
00:37:39.24 --> 00:37:42.28
He knows what the investment is. It's his time. It's his effort

565
00:37:43.24 --> 00:37:45.24
And he's putting everything into it

566
00:37:45.56 --> 00:37:51.64
And he's already achieved. He's gotten what he what the return that he's gotten. He's like, you know what I got enough money

567
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:53.88
I got enough fame

568
00:37:53.88 --> 00:37:59.56
I got enough credit, you know street cred from who gives street cred comedians cred or something

569
00:38:00.12 --> 00:38:05.16
Well, it is literally one of the if not the most successful sitcom of all time

570
00:38:05.64 --> 00:38:10.12
So that's like that's a big deal to be like, oh, i'm done. Did you watch that show a lot? Yes

571
00:38:10.68 --> 00:38:15.16
Like all of it. Yes. Okay pretty good. I think so. Yes

572
00:38:16.52 --> 00:38:21.48
But it relates to like all the little everyday things in life and at like point. It's yeah, it's pretty good

573
00:38:21.48 --> 00:38:26.20
It's it's very I've watched I've watched probably I've watched some of them probably like 20 of them or something like that

574
00:38:26.20 --> 00:38:29.000
But if there's nine seasons, I really not even scratch in the surface

575
00:38:29.40 --> 00:38:33.24
But that's a great example. He looked at it measured the ROI

576
00:38:34.44 --> 00:38:39.24
And said, okay, cool. I'm done and there you go. Good. Good, uh

577
00:38:40.68 --> 00:38:45.40
Good metaphor there next one is from that jake denham

578
00:38:45.40 --> 00:38:52.44
Denham something like that. How did you learn about real estate investing? Um, a guy told me

579
00:38:53.48 --> 00:38:55.48
A guy a sky in the seal teams

580
00:38:56.36 --> 00:38:59.000
That I worked for was like, yeah, you know, I bought I bought houses

581
00:38:59.80 --> 00:39:03.40
And they increased in value over time. I mean, I don't know how he said it specifically

582
00:39:03.96 --> 00:39:07.96
But that but that's basically what he said to me. He probably said something like, you know, I bought this house

583
00:39:08.04 --> 00:39:12.44
Eight years ago. He's older than me. I bought this house eight years ago for 150 grand

584
00:39:12.44 --> 00:39:15.56
It's worth like 400 grand now and I must have been like, hmm like

585
00:39:16.36 --> 00:39:18.36
the slow turning

586
00:39:19.08 --> 00:39:21.88
Things coming together and the other thing in this one I did remember

587
00:39:22.60 --> 00:39:27.80
He was like because he rented these houses out. He's like someone else is paying my mortgage

588
00:39:29.24 --> 00:39:34.12
And that seemed very smart and I realized that I was one of those people that was paying someone else's mortgage

589
00:39:34.60 --> 00:39:36.60
and I didn't like that so

590
00:39:37.40 --> 00:39:40.20
Started buying houses, you know bought at a time buy a house

591
00:39:40.20 --> 00:39:46.36
Yeah, as soon as I had that house was kind of settled in and then bought another one and just tried to hold on to him

592
00:39:46.44 --> 00:39:48.44
And that's what I did. Um

593
00:39:49.40 --> 00:39:55.88
Yeah, that's how I that's how I learned about real estate investing. I took some really simplistic phrases from a dude

594
00:39:55.88 --> 00:40:00.76
That was telling me what was up and just saw the game. I I saw the game

595
00:40:01.48 --> 00:40:02.52
That's

596
00:40:02.52 --> 00:40:08.76
Let's bring it back to this right? I saw that this guy had bought a house for 100 grand and now it was worth 300 grand

597
00:40:08.76 --> 00:40:10.76
In like a seven-year period

598
00:40:10.92 --> 00:40:16.76
But more that seemed cool more important. I realized that someone else was paying for that house

599
00:40:17.08 --> 00:40:18.36
Yeah

600
00:40:18.36 --> 00:40:23.24
And I realized where I was on the board on the game board, right? I was paying rent, bro

601
00:40:24.20 --> 00:40:28.36
I was paying for someone else's house. How would you feel if you're like at a bar?

602
00:40:29.56 --> 00:40:31.96
And like you're sitting there drinking your beer

603
00:40:33.08 --> 00:40:37.16
And then the bill comes over and you're signing it and you're signing there's some other go dude. He's having like

604
00:40:37.16 --> 00:40:41.80
Orderves he's having bottle service bottle service and they're like, yeah, you're

605
00:40:42.76 --> 00:40:45.80
Here's his bill. You'd be pissed. You wouldn't stand for it

606
00:40:45.96 --> 00:40:49.80
But we stand for that with when it comes to where we live. We basically stand for it

607
00:40:50.36 --> 00:40:54.76
So once I realized we're out that's a good example of oh

608
00:40:55.88 --> 00:40:58.20
There's a game. I didn't know I was part of the game. I didn't know it's part of the game

609
00:40:58.60 --> 00:41:03.08
I thought that's what was happening. You gave me the bill. I signed it. I didn't know this guy was over here with bottle service

610
00:41:03.64 --> 00:41:05.24
You know, I'm paying for his bottle service

611
00:41:05.24 --> 00:41:07.56
That's what you're doing. You're buying someone a house when you're paying rent

612
00:41:08.12 --> 00:41:12.36
Look, are there times we got a rent? Sure. You go to you take a job. You're in a job for a short period of time

613
00:41:12.36 --> 00:41:15.24
You're only gonna be in this city for a year and it's you don't know what's gonna happen the market

614
00:41:15.24 --> 00:41:19.16
I'm not saying go run out and buy a house tomorrow. You need to understand what's happening

615
00:41:19.56 --> 00:41:22.60
But if you know, you're gonna be somewhere for a longer period of time

616
00:41:24.36 --> 00:41:26.44
Yeah, and you can afford to buy a house go buy a house

617
00:41:27.88 --> 00:41:33.08
So I realized that that's what realized that's what made me realize it's one of the earlier games

618
00:41:33.08 --> 00:41:35.08
That I checked into

619
00:41:35.96 --> 00:41:37.96
um, another question from him is

620
00:41:38.44 --> 00:41:41.32
How to know when you're playing the wrong game and it's time to quit

621
00:41:42.12 --> 00:41:44.12
Or switch games. Okay

622
00:41:44.28 --> 00:41:46.28
ROI, right?

623
00:41:46.68 --> 00:41:49.56
Uh, measure the ROI. What are you getting out of this?

624
00:41:50.84 --> 00:41:54.76
If you're gonna get a lot out of it, but it's a lot of effort. Okay. Well, is it worth the effort?

625
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Is it worth the investment time money leadership capital, whatever the thing is

626
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.20
Family is it going to be worth it?

627
00:42:03.32 --> 00:42:05.16
Or is it not?

628
00:42:05.16 --> 00:42:09.64
And so you when you figure out the risks and you figure out the investment and you figure out the return

629
00:42:09.72 --> 00:42:12.68
You may or may not get based on those risks. Okay, then you can make a decision

630
00:42:15.40 --> 00:42:17.88
We also now what's interesting about this question is

631
00:42:18.76 --> 00:42:24.12
We're in the game. He's saying you're playing the wrong game. So now what we have to do is we have to do an honest assessment of our

632
00:42:25.72 --> 00:42:27.72
Trajectory in this game, right?

633
00:42:27.72 --> 00:42:29.72
How well am I doing?

634
00:42:29.80 --> 00:42:31.80
Am I making progress?

635
00:42:32.04 --> 00:42:35.80
You know how now in the UFC when you watch the UFC they have the odds

636
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.48
They show the odds after each round

637
00:42:40.52 --> 00:42:44.20
Yeah, so now that's a new thing. I don't know how new it is, but it's a few years old but

638
00:42:45.64 --> 00:42:51.40
Like oh echo really did great in that last round against jaco. His odds of winning now just went up

639
00:42:52.20 --> 00:42:55.88
Oh, jaco just came back and had a great round and plus echo was like stunned at the end of the round

640
00:42:55.88 --> 00:43:00.36
It looks like he was going to get knocked out. He got saved by the bell. Oh jaco's odds just went up for the last round a lot

641
00:43:02.68 --> 00:43:05.32
You have to do an assessment and see where you're at, right?

642
00:43:06.36 --> 00:43:12.60
And see what is your trajectory of what's happening? It's kind of like what you said you did with your jiu-jitsu career

643
00:43:12.92 --> 00:43:16.20
You're like, okay, I'm 30 whatever you're 34 years old

644
00:43:16.92 --> 00:43:22.52
I'm the seventh best guy in my gym, which is not bad, but let's face it. We're one gym

645
00:43:22.52 --> 00:43:28.28
Okay, and I'm making progress, but so is everybody else

646
00:43:29.40 --> 00:43:31.40
Okay, where am I? Where am I going with this?

647
00:43:32.60 --> 00:43:38.28
Same thing with a job, you know, okay, I've been at the same job. I've been in this position for for four years

648
00:43:39.96 --> 00:43:42.52
I haven't been promoted in the last three years

649
00:43:43.40 --> 00:43:45.56
I don't have a good relationship with my boss

650
00:43:47.48 --> 00:43:49.48
This does not seem like it's a good fit for me

651
00:43:49.48 --> 00:43:53.40
So you've got to do an honest assessment of your trajectory

652
00:43:54.92 --> 00:43:56.92
and

653
00:43:57.24 --> 00:43:59.24
Make a decision

654
00:43:59.72 --> 00:44:01.56
Uh

655
00:44:01.56 --> 00:44:04.92
One thing that you can do is you can kind of mitigate risk, right?

656
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.96
This is a story I've told a few times, but greg mackentire. Sure great train. Yeah, great train

657
00:44:10.52 --> 00:44:12.52
At a certain point greg's a badass

658
00:44:12.84 --> 00:44:17.64
He's a freaking great wrestler his jiu-jitsu solid. He's a great athlete. He's a good boxer

659
00:44:17.64 --> 00:44:22.36
and he was kind of he was he was starting in the MMA scene and

660
00:44:24.36 --> 00:44:31.56
He had like he had real legit potential in MMA because he's a great wrestler tough as nails

661
00:44:32.20 --> 00:44:35.80
Strong for I mean he's freaking 50 155 pounder. He's strong as hell

662
00:44:36.68 --> 00:44:38.12
so greg train

663
00:44:38.12 --> 00:44:40.12
Actually asked me and this was like

664
00:44:40.44 --> 00:44:44.60
Probably 15 or 20 years ago. This is a long time ago. This is probably 20 years ago

665
00:44:44.60 --> 00:44:47.24
He was like, what do you think I should do?

666
00:44:48.60 --> 00:44:53.72
Should I just dedicate my whole life right now to MMA?

667
00:44:55.72 --> 00:45:01.64
Or should I keep training but also he wanted to get a degree. He wanted to become an x-ray technician. That's what he is, right?

668
00:45:02.84 --> 00:45:04.84
And I was like listen bro

669
00:45:05.56 --> 00:45:07.56
How many hours a day can you train?

670
00:45:08.04 --> 00:45:11.48
Legitimately and I said can you train 16 hours a day?

671
00:45:11.48 --> 00:45:16.60
And he said no I said no one can train 16 hours a day. How many if you really train hard?

672
00:45:16.76 --> 00:45:19.72
How many hours a day can you train including recovery like the whole nine yards?

673
00:45:19.96 --> 00:45:24.76
He's like, I don't know maybe four or five right? That's like training conditioning recovery

674
00:45:25.32 --> 00:45:27.32
Maybe you do six. Maybe you do six

675
00:45:28.44 --> 00:45:31.72
Okay, you're gonna work eight hours a day you sleep eight hours a day

676
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.68
That's 16 hours

677
00:45:34.68 --> 00:45:35.48
right

678
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:37.48
You got plenty of time

679
00:45:37.48 --> 00:45:44.76
to train and you can still have a backup to MMA in case you go to wrestling practice tomorrow

680
00:45:45.24 --> 00:45:49.08
And blow your knee out which can happen on any given day

681
00:45:50.60 --> 00:45:56.36
And so he played both games, you know and and he he you know, he had a good run at MMA

682
00:45:56.36 --> 00:46:01.32
he also ran into some problems that were tough to deal with and so

683
00:46:02.36 --> 00:46:04.36
he mitigated the risk

684
00:46:04.52 --> 00:46:06.52
played more than one game at the same time

685
00:46:06.52 --> 00:46:11.000
And when the MMA thing dried up guess what he still had a cool career

686
00:46:11.32 --> 00:46:15.24
Making good money beautiful family taking care of them house like the whole nine yards

687
00:46:16.12 --> 00:46:21.16
So that's a situation where he didn't necessarily quit the other game

688
00:46:22.44 --> 00:46:24.44
but he he

689
00:46:24.52 --> 00:46:28.60
mitigated the risk by playing multiple games at the same time

690
00:46:29.88 --> 00:46:35.16
So there's this thing called the sunk cost fallacy. Yeah, it's like I got it in one of these questions for sure

691
00:46:35.16 --> 00:46:39.24
Yeah, because that's a factor and I'm thinking back to my bouncer days where

692
00:46:39.88 --> 00:46:43.48
You know, I had you know, kind of you know, I spent a few years there and like

693
00:46:44.12 --> 00:46:49.000
And I remember one time my brother Jade he goes he goes. Hey, you ever thought about getting another job and I was offended

694
00:46:49.40 --> 00:46:51.000
I was like bro all the

695
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.12
Stuff I learned all the friends that I made all the stuff like basically all these commitments that I've made over the years

696
00:46:56.36 --> 00:47:00.12
And accumulated all these little, you know results or whatever

697
00:47:00.12 --> 00:47:05.000
I kind of kept me in there kind of like hey if I get it if I start all over it's kind of like what about all that

698
00:47:05.16 --> 00:47:12.36
What I put into that given the circumstances and I'll tell you you probably just gave the most shallow example of sunk cost fallacy

699
00:47:13.24 --> 00:47:19.88
Because honestly, yeah, because if you think about it, I mean, what is that really like you didn't you look you you made some friends

700
00:47:20.12 --> 00:47:25.08
You had a moved up the chain where you were now like the shift lead or something like that

701
00:47:25.48 --> 00:47:27.64
Which probably took you six months or something

702
00:47:27.64 --> 00:47:33.72
And when you get to people that are in legit sunk call, oh, it's like, oh, I went to I went to undergrad

703
00:47:33.80 --> 00:47:36.44
I got my pre-law. I went to law school

704
00:47:36.92 --> 00:47:41.48
I did my freaking time as a clerk and went up through the chain of command and now I'm a lawyer

705
00:47:41.48 --> 00:47:43.48
It's been eight years. I've invested

706
00:47:44.44 --> 00:47:48.36
$450,000 and I freaking hate it. You know, I hate this job. Yeah

707
00:47:49.32 --> 00:47:51.48
That's sunk cost. Yeah where they go

708
00:47:51.48 --> 00:47:57.08
Do do I really walk away from this right now? That's where people have to that's where the sunk cost makes people

709
00:47:57.40 --> 00:48:00.04
Stick with the same crappy job, but they don't like

710
00:48:00.76 --> 00:48:04.76
For a long period of time, which I recommend definitely watching out for well

711
00:48:04.76 --> 00:48:10.84
You know, well, you know the the common example of sunk cost is the movie theater one, which is more shallow than mine even

712
00:48:11.32 --> 00:48:14.12
Do you you already paid for the movie? So yeah, you go to the movie

713
00:48:14.52 --> 00:48:18.68
You go through halfway three quarters and you're like, I might as well finish it, you know, I'm

714
00:48:18.68 --> 00:48:23.24
I'm here. You know what I'm gonna do walk out of the movie. I already paid you know that, you know, but no, bro

715
00:48:23.48 --> 00:48:24.68
walk out

716
00:48:24.68 --> 00:48:25.72
I

717
00:48:25.72 --> 00:48:28.28
What I do in a movie sucks. I just go to sleep, bro

718
00:48:29.40 --> 00:48:35.24
I feel so like comfortable sleeping in theaters. Have you when my kids were little we'd go to see like one of those kids movies

719
00:48:35.24 --> 00:48:40.28
Oh, yeah, and and look, there's some really good kids movies, but a lot of times they just they're just not good

720
00:48:40.44 --> 00:48:42.44
But I would just mon

721
00:48:42.52 --> 00:48:44.68
Incredibles. Yeah, it's good. The Incredibles

722
00:48:44.92 --> 00:48:46.92
I like Moana. That was a good one, man

723
00:48:46.92 --> 00:48:50.52
I don't think I made it through that one. Come on

724
00:48:52.92 --> 00:48:57.64
I don't know if I made it. There's a lot of them that is some coins for sure. Yeah, so but most of them go to sleep

725
00:48:58.12 --> 00:49:02.36
I haven't walked out of a lot of movies. Well, that's different. So like you walked out of a lot of movies

726
00:49:02.60 --> 00:49:05.48
I walked out on the one with Angelina Jolie and Ethan Hawke

727
00:49:06.92 --> 00:49:11.40
Back at the time. I don't even yeah, I even forget what it was. I remember he there. I don't think I've

728
00:49:13.48 --> 00:49:15.48
It didn't seem like you're kind of moving though, but

729
00:49:15.48 --> 00:49:19.80
But but keep in mind I think when you walk out of the like you can't just tell the kids

730
00:49:19.80 --> 00:49:24.36
Hey, I'm bored with this kids movie. So, you know, self-course fall asleep. That's like

731
00:49:25.08 --> 00:49:29.40
Yeah, that's a good kind of a joke in my family. Let it's like when we when they would know

732
00:49:29.80 --> 00:49:33.08
Yeah, I'm just going to sleep. It's not time for just snore

733
00:49:33.56 --> 00:49:34.92
and embarrass them

734
00:49:34.92 --> 00:49:36.20
Yes

735
00:49:36.20 --> 00:49:40.20
So again, this boils back to we have to pay attention to risk

736
00:49:40.20 --> 00:49:45.40
Investment and return on investment and we have to do an honest assessment if you're in the game

737
00:49:45.56 --> 00:49:47.56
You got to check your trajectory honestly

738
00:49:48.28 --> 00:49:52.92
And look you echo looked at his trajectory and said, you know what? I'm kind of a shift lead now

739
00:49:53.08 --> 00:49:56.52
I got these friends. I could I could get beer, you know, whenever I want

740
00:49:57.08 --> 00:50:00.04
I'm head of the line privileges at these other clubs. I kind of

741
00:50:00.92 --> 00:50:02.20
Right. Yep

742
00:50:02.20 --> 00:50:07.32
But he had to look at a longer term trajectory like okay, where am I going to be in five years?

743
00:50:07.32 --> 00:50:13.88
And all you have to do is meet that one person that's like been a been in some position that you're in but they've been there for

744
00:50:14.52 --> 00:50:20.84
17 years. Yeah, and you're like, oh, so there's like one more element involved in that exact thing right there. So

745
00:50:21.72 --> 00:50:23.72
You know when I started over there at the club

746
00:50:24.20 --> 00:50:31.16
I was 23 just turned 23. So, you know, you see a guy who's like 40. You're like, oh, well, I'm only 20 that's like

747
00:50:31.96 --> 00:50:36.52
Two decades from now, you know, like brah. I'll be you know, whatever. You don't even think it's so far ahead

748
00:50:36.52 --> 00:50:41.96
But then when you uh, after a while you get old actually, it's not like for it. It's like you see a guy who's 30

749
00:50:42.12 --> 00:50:46.12
You're like, oh, I'm not gonna meet that. That's like seven years. It's forever. It's like a third of my life, right?

750
00:50:46.76 --> 00:50:52.76
Yeah, what's he doing here? Yeah, and to be honest, you don't even apply it to yourself because that's just him and too bad

751
00:50:52.84 --> 00:50:58.84
I mean, I guess cool up to you. That's your life, you know, whatever and then you start reaching 20 29 and remember back

752
00:50:58.92 --> 00:51:04.28
Wait a second. I was looking at that 130 and that's next year. So you're like, dang. That's when it hits you

753
00:51:04.28 --> 00:51:09.64
Yeah, for sure. That's all it means. That's real. That's when you realized you were uh,

754
00:51:10.28 --> 00:51:15.88
Stationary you were running on a treadmill that wouldn't get you anywhere. Um in a certain lane for sure. You were in the wrong game

755
00:51:16.12 --> 00:51:17.48
I was in the wrong game

756
00:51:17.48 --> 00:51:21.16
But here's the thing though, like I don't want to paint this picture like it was all shit because to be honest

757
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:23.96
Like I learned so much which I didn't even realize by the way

758
00:51:24.44 --> 00:51:30.52
I learned so much just dealing with people under certain types of circumstances. You're like, ah, you know, like

759
00:51:30.52 --> 00:51:36.36
But yes, like after a while you kind of hit the wall in that regard where you're like, well as far as a career

760
00:51:36.44 --> 00:51:40.36
Because really when you reach 30s, that's like if you're not in it

761
00:51:41.08 --> 00:51:45.96
You're kind of like looking out for one, you know, and I didn't think did you ever think about opening your own club?

762
00:51:46.04 --> 00:51:48.04
Yeah, and then what happened with that

763
00:51:48.60 --> 00:51:50.60
It was just thought, you know

764
00:51:52.68 --> 00:51:55.32
It just didn't even yeah, it didn't formulate

765
00:51:55.40 --> 00:51:58.52
Well, me and star started dating then, you know when you have like a girlfriend was

766
00:51:58.52 --> 00:52:00.12
a one in my case

767
00:52:00.12 --> 00:52:02.12
I had a girlfriend who had like a for real job

768
00:52:02.12 --> 00:52:04.92
She was making like for real money like adult money

769
00:52:05.56 --> 00:52:08.68
You know, what was she doing property management? Oh, check

770
00:52:09.08 --> 00:52:11.80
So you kind of compare it, you know, I was like, yeah

771
00:52:11.96 --> 00:52:16.92
I'm what I'm gonna open a nightclub and be up all night still, you know, and I got to wake up at like 11 noon

772
00:52:17.40 --> 00:52:23.24
Me meanwhile, you know, I'm like 35 40 years old doing that all the time like as a routine. I'm like, eh

773
00:52:23.88 --> 00:52:27.16
Which is would be cool, but I just contrasted it to again

774
00:52:27.16 --> 00:52:34.76
Like this is it's very important that you were able to detach and do an assessment and look at the game of like nightclub

775
00:52:34.92 --> 00:52:36.44
Ownership and what does that entail?

776
00:52:36.44 --> 00:52:42.36
I mean, you've got to be there like you looked at the game and you had a good comparison to look at Sarah's game and be like, oh look

777
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.40
We're gonna be playing two different wildly different games

778
00:52:45.64 --> 00:52:49.64
That's if the Venn diagram doesn't overlap very much like we'll see each other for

779
00:52:50.04 --> 00:52:55.000
Actually, we don't even see each other at night because she comes home. You're at the club. She's okay. Yeah, like a couple nights only

780
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.56
Yeah, so you you measured the trajectory the ROI the possibilities and you saw it. It wasn't good. Yeah

781
00:53:01.88 --> 00:53:03.88
Good job, echo Charles

782
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Next question is from

783
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.60
Levi

784
00:53:08.60 --> 00:53:10.28
Mix, I don't know

785
00:53:10.28 --> 00:53:11.40
Levick mix

786
00:53:11.40 --> 00:53:17.88
He says, how do you play the game and trust that you're able to make competent decisions that are congruent with your growth?

787
00:53:17.88 --> 00:53:26.52
For example, I've grown in almost unfathomable ways over the last year, but I still have mindsets from who I previously was

788
00:53:26.92 --> 00:53:28.92
When making incompetent choices

789
00:53:31.88 --> 00:53:33.88
I think what you need to do is

790
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.52
Take a step back and a beautiful way and I'm probably gonna say this a bunch

791
00:53:39.32 --> 00:53:41.08
is

792
00:53:41.08 --> 00:53:44.28
When you want to detach and you want to assess what's happening

793
00:53:44.28 --> 00:53:47.24
Take a step back write down what's happening?

794
00:53:47.24 --> 00:53:50.76
Write down like when you got to make a decision write down

795
00:53:51.96 --> 00:53:56.28
The pros and cons that's why pros and cons lists are good. It's not good because you don't know it

796
00:53:56.28 --> 00:53:59.64
It's good because it makes you look at it from a detached perspective you get to see

797
00:54:00.44 --> 00:54:04.20
You keep it all in your mind. You're in it when you take when you write it down. Okay. Here's what's good

798
00:54:04.20 --> 00:54:09.88
Here's what's bad. Oh my gosh. The bad really outweighs the good. Okay. Cool. Because you were able to take a step back

799
00:54:09.88 --> 00:54:16.52
So writing things down when you come up to a decision point. Hey, wait a second. Let me just let me just go over

800
00:54:17.48 --> 00:54:20.12
What are the outcomes that I could get?

801
00:54:20.76 --> 00:54:22.76
From making this decision

802
00:54:22.84 --> 00:54:25.32
How is this going to go and then?

803
00:54:27.40 --> 00:54:32.44
Try and answer those questions without letting your emotions get involved again not not void of emotions

804
00:54:32.84 --> 00:54:34.84
Put the emotions in the calculus

805
00:54:35.16 --> 00:54:38.92
But don't let that drive the entire decision and then of course

806
00:54:38.92 --> 00:54:41.80
Make iterative decisions and then listen to the feedback

807
00:54:42.28 --> 00:54:45.16
So make a little small decision in direction that you think is right

808
00:54:45.80 --> 00:54:50.20
And then pay attention to what the feedback is and make sure that it was the right decision if it's not then change it

809
00:54:51.72 --> 00:54:56.04
Do you and this is kind of a weird hypothetical question for you. Do you let's say

810
00:54:57.16 --> 00:54:58.92
your

811
00:54:58.92 --> 00:55:04.84
30 30 year old self still in the military, right? Yeah, the dirt. Yeah, hell yeah

812
00:55:04.84 --> 00:55:13.32
If that 30 year old jaco saw your jaco right now and would like watch you and whatever would would the 30 year old jaco be like

813
00:55:13.64 --> 00:55:20.36
Oh, shit. He's a different person or would he be like, okay? He's just like older and wiser. I think he'd be like, uh

814
00:55:21.48 --> 00:55:25.80
Yeah, the that oh, I see the conclusion of that idea the way it developed

815
00:55:26.36 --> 00:55:30.44
I see like it's kind of cool. Like when I look back at my career in the military

816
00:55:30.44 --> 00:55:34.44
Yeah, I don't say, you know from a leadership perspective

817
00:55:35.32 --> 00:55:37.32
Here's this horrible thing that I did

818
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:41.08
And it didn't work. Yeah, usually I'm like, hey, here's what I did

819
00:55:41.72 --> 00:55:46.68
And this is why I did it and it still makes sense and that goes back to when I was 30 years old

820
00:55:46.68 --> 00:55:49.64
Now there's things I go. You know what could have done that better

821
00:55:49.80 --> 00:55:55.000
But I can see that the trajectory of the way I was thinking was just not fully formulated yet

822
00:55:55.72 --> 00:55:59.08
But I wasn't doing anything that was like 180 out. Yeah, you know

823
00:55:59.08 --> 00:56:01.16
Uh-huh. It was like, oh, yeah, I really hadn't

824
00:56:01.80 --> 00:56:07.48
I really hadn't quite gotten to this conclusion yet. Yeah, or I hadn't evolved that

825
00:56:08.12 --> 00:56:13.08
Thought pattern yet, but it was going in the right direction. So I think if my 30 year old self would go

826
00:56:13.16 --> 00:56:15.40
Oh, yeah, I can see where that we got that from

827
00:56:15.88 --> 00:56:20.04
Yeah, yeah, that makes something along those lines because I make I'm kind of remit and I'm sure it's like

828
00:56:20.52 --> 00:56:25.32
You know the slow burn of you changing in whatever way you change since even before

829
00:56:25.32 --> 00:56:29.08
We you know back back in the day when we were like training I was competing and you're

830
00:56:29.56 --> 00:56:34.84
To me it feels like you're the same person like literally the same talk trash person except now you

831
00:56:35.64 --> 00:56:39.72
Talk about leadership to you know like a site, but yeah, and what's funny is when you and I were training

832
00:56:39.72 --> 00:56:42.68
I was talking about leadership just not to you. Yeah, like I mean I was already

833
00:56:43.48 --> 00:56:45.16
you know, that's

834
00:56:45.16 --> 00:56:49.000
That's what I was doing. Yeah, do you know and I think I told you this

835
00:56:50.20 --> 00:56:53.08
Actually, you already know this because you were part of it the first video I made

836
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:58.28
For money was with you actually the first like five video. I mean this money was but um

837
00:56:59.16 --> 00:57:03.88
You were talking about leadership to some teachers. It's like we were making a dvd or something

838
00:57:04.44 --> 00:57:08.12
And uh, it was for teachers and I so I came across that all those files

839
00:57:08.20 --> 00:57:15.56
And I was listening to it and it's all like underdeveloped echelon front stuff. Oh for sure. It's so funny. You're all young

840
00:57:17.64 --> 00:57:20.76
But anyway, my point is yeah, like you it doesn't seem like you changed at all

841
00:57:20.76 --> 00:57:24.84
No, and like the principles that we talk about like when you're talking about that

842
00:57:25.80 --> 00:57:28.12
Those principles are the same the same thing

843
00:57:28.68 --> 00:57:34.12
Um, there's not been there there might be like I have might have a better way of explaining something

844
00:57:34.36 --> 00:57:40.12
Showing a different angle for sure. Oh, yeah, but your way you're actually are a lot different

845
00:57:40.20 --> 00:57:43.64
It just doesn't seem it doesn't feel like it to me like day to day

846
00:57:43.96 --> 00:57:47.48
But yeah, if I were to if you were to like rewind and even watching those videos

847
00:57:47.48 --> 00:57:51.56
I'm like, oh, this is like young jocco, but you're still the same jocco, but you change a lot, but

848
00:57:52.52 --> 00:57:56.52
It's like I'm comparing it to myself like when I was like 25 or something

849
00:57:56.92 --> 00:57:57.96
bro

850
00:57:57.96 --> 00:58:01.64
My 25 year old still would barely recognize me. Well, yeah, that's true

851
00:58:01.72 --> 00:58:08.60
I think with everybody and if you like my 25 year old self was definitely wild like was a little bit out of control and was

852
00:58:09.40 --> 00:58:10.60
uh

853
00:58:10.60 --> 00:58:14.68
kind of a maniac and I remember I remember when we were on with uh

854
00:58:14.68 --> 00:58:16.68
With uh, Jim conco

855
00:58:17.64 --> 00:58:21.24
And charlie plumb and they were like talking these guys are like

856
00:58:21.96 --> 00:58:23.32
just

857
00:58:23.32 --> 00:58:27.000
I don't want to use the word saintly but kind of saintly like heroic dudes

858
00:58:27.08 --> 00:58:32.44
Yeah, and they were kind of like throwing me in you know with this sort of uh elevated

859
00:58:33.16 --> 00:58:34.60
kind of

860
00:58:34.60 --> 00:58:36.92
Virtue and I was like, hey guys, I just want to make sure

861
00:58:37.96 --> 00:58:41.24
like I was a maniac when I was younger and

862
00:58:41.24 --> 00:58:44.20
So let's not get too crazy with that stuff

863
00:58:46.68 --> 00:58:49.56
But uh, but yeah, I mean the the principles and also

864
00:58:50.36 --> 00:58:56.36
You know you explain something and then you explain it again and you see oh that was a little bit better

865
00:58:56.44 --> 00:59:00.20
So you get better at explaining stuff over time, especially

866
00:59:00.68 --> 00:59:04.92
Going from explaining stuff to guys in the teams where you're just using pure

867
00:59:06.04 --> 00:59:08.04
military examples and then as

868
00:59:08.04 --> 00:59:11.40
I worked with more and more companies like oh, here's another civilian example

869
00:59:11.40 --> 00:59:15.16
Here's another business example. There's a family example and you start to be able to be able to

870
00:59:15.80 --> 00:59:17.80
Tap into these other

871
00:59:17.88 --> 00:59:20.68
ways of explaining things that are that are

872
00:59:21.72 --> 00:59:25.80
Easier for some people to understand makes sense. Yeah, so there you go

873
00:59:26.92 --> 00:59:28.92
uh next one

874
00:59:29.72 --> 00:59:31.72
Digarmo for

875
00:59:32.92 --> 00:59:37.000
Thoughts on how your concept of the game matches and or contradicts

876
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Uh, Simon Sennick's

877
00:59:39.08 --> 00:59:44.68
finite or infinite infinite game concept and that's that's a good question. Obviously

878
00:59:45.64 --> 00:59:52.12
Using the term game and there's gonna be let's see where that ends up and and one thing that's interesting about this is

879
00:59:52.84 --> 00:59:55.64
That idea of finding finite versus infinite games

880
00:59:56.20 --> 01:00:01.40
Is actually from a guy named james kars who is an american philosopher

881
01:00:02.04 --> 01:00:05.08
uh academic guy from nyu and he wrote a book

882
01:00:05.08 --> 01:00:10.12
In 1987 that's called finite and infinite infinite games

883
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.76
uh

884
01:00:12.76 --> 01:00:16.76
But as far as the concept goes it's it's not so much that

885
01:00:18.44 --> 01:00:22.36
They match or they contradict what we've been talking about

886
01:00:23.56 --> 01:00:25.96
It's it's not that they match or they contradict

887
01:00:26.68 --> 01:00:30.20
So to give you the definition here a finite game is like any game that has

888
01:00:30.20 --> 01:00:37.48
Parameters around it so I always say chess like chess you have 64 squares you got 16 piece per side

889
01:00:37.80 --> 01:00:42.20
They can only the pieces can only move in certain directions, right? That's a finite game

890
01:00:43.72 --> 01:00:49.48
Basketball uh, there's a court. There's a ball. There's a number of steps you can take when you're not dribbling

891
01:00:49.48 --> 01:00:54.52
There's a height of the basket. There's a number of points that you get for a shot when you make it depending where you are

892
01:00:54.84 --> 01:00:56.84
so so all those things are

893
01:00:56.84 --> 01:01:04.68
Those are finite games and what one of the reasons like uh that I originally thought of this

894
01:01:06.28 --> 01:01:07.72
Myself

895
01:01:07.72 --> 01:01:09.88
I'm not trying to say I thought of the idea was

896
01:01:10.76 --> 01:01:12.28
Uh chess

897
01:01:12.28 --> 01:01:17.000
I heard I think lex freedman. Maybe it was lex, but someone talking about the fact that

898
01:01:18.36 --> 01:01:19.56
That

899
01:01:19.56 --> 01:01:22.28
A computer can win in chess because it's a finite game

900
01:01:22.28 --> 01:01:27.16
So either zone number moves and if you can you can get that thing to run out the

901
01:01:27.80 --> 01:01:32.60
The eventualities of each move and come to the best move and it can be the human

902
01:01:33.48 --> 01:01:35.48
Infinite games that have no rules

903
01:01:36.04 --> 01:01:37.88
There a computer

904
01:01:37.88 --> 01:01:40.52
Might not be able to win because it's not going to be able to

905
01:01:41.32 --> 01:01:46.84
Do something that's totally unexpected. It's not going to have the creativity that's needed now. Look we got a i coming in chat

906
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.16
GPT and all this stuff so

907
01:01:49.16 --> 01:01:52.44
It's gonna but it's gonna take some sort of

908
01:01:54.28 --> 01:01:58.92
Really revolutionary technology for a machine to be a

909
01:02:00.04 --> 01:02:05.64
Human in an infinite game an infinite game is like life, right? There's no rules. You can move you

910
01:02:06.28 --> 01:02:08.28
a total war

911
01:02:09.24 --> 01:02:14.20
Total war this is a war where you're like this is for our survival, which means we're gonna do whatever it takes

912
01:02:14.20 --> 01:02:17.80
There's no rules for as long. Yeah for as long as it takes no rules

913
01:02:17.80 --> 01:02:20.84
Hmm street fighting for survival

914
01:02:22.12 --> 01:02:28.92
Like that's sort of an infinite game because if you grab a bottle you can smash it on the dood's head and cut his throat open

915
01:02:29.64 --> 01:02:33.72
Uh, if you get a chance to slam them their face down if you have a weapon

916
01:02:34.12 --> 01:02:37.72
Like it's sort of just hey, whatever you got you can bring it into the game

917
01:02:38.76 --> 01:02:43.48
And so you could have a computer that's like, oh, i'm gonna i will the first move i would do would be a throat punch

918
01:02:43.48 --> 01:02:48.52
And then cool i put two bullets inside because i was carrying a gun like i win infinite game

919
01:02:50.12 --> 01:02:51.88
So

920
01:02:51.88 --> 01:02:57.88
finite games and here's the thing finite games are generally the smaller games and infinite games are the bigger ones

921
01:02:58.28 --> 01:03:03.08
So what you want to win what you want to win at is the infinite game and by the way this

922
01:03:05.24 --> 01:03:07.000
For me

923
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.16
Life is an infinite game obviously you can go anywhere

924
01:03:09.16 --> 01:03:16.60
But more important to me is there's degrees in between finite and infinite right that is that most games

925
01:03:17.88 --> 01:03:20.28
Most games have some level of rules

926
01:03:21.24 --> 01:03:23.24
and where those rules are

927
01:03:24.36 --> 01:03:26.84
You can have some games are very strict

928
01:03:27.72 --> 01:03:31.08
Some games are very very very loose. There's very limited rules

929
01:03:31.80 --> 01:03:34.52
Uh business has rules business has laws

930
01:03:34.52 --> 01:03:41.56
But you can actually go and you can change and you can disrupt like that's the big thing right when i disrupt the industry

931
01:03:41.88 --> 01:03:44.44
Yeah, it's because you were playing a finite game

932
01:03:44.92 --> 01:03:51.16
Making your widget and all of a sudden i realized that i could make my widget that does something radically different to yours

933
01:03:51.32 --> 01:03:54.52
And what yours does and all of a sudden you're out of you're out of business man. Yeah

934
01:03:55.48 --> 01:03:57.000
so

935
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
When you can recognize that

936
01:04:00.04 --> 01:04:02.44
When you can recognize what the rules are

937
01:04:02.44 --> 01:04:07.40
And generally figure out okay those rules apply, but do i have to follow them?

938
01:04:10.04 --> 01:04:12.04
And um

939
01:04:12.12 --> 01:04:17.80
The same thing with like families like there's a wide there's a wide variety of ways people live as families right?

940
01:04:18.04 --> 01:04:21.96
Just take a city versus hey this family lives in a city this family lives in a farm

941
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:28.28
This family lives in a van and surfs up and down the california coast. They don't have jobs. They have

942
01:04:29.08 --> 01:04:31.08
Whatever they sell bracelets

943
01:04:31.08 --> 01:04:32.76
On the seawall

944
01:04:32.76 --> 01:04:38.28
That's a real thing like there's families that that's what they do they surf and they sell bracelets on the seawall

945
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.44
Right, that's a that's now the other person that's playing the game is like

946
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.44
Making a bunch of money working at a hedge fund trying to afford a place in malibu so the family can surf

947
01:04:51.16 --> 01:04:53.16
He can only surf every once in a while

948
01:04:53.64 --> 01:04:55.64
Who won the game?

949
01:04:56.04 --> 01:04:57.48
Who won the game?

950
01:04:57.48 --> 01:05:02.44
I don't know dude. No this guy's he doesn't just surf at malibu. This other dude's in a van. He's going

951
01:05:02.68 --> 01:05:08.04
He's going to ren con. He's going up to santa cruz. He's coming back down to dego. He's all over the place

952
01:05:08.92 --> 01:05:11.72
This other dude. He's actually working most of the time. Yeah

953
01:05:12.44 --> 01:05:14.44
and by the way

954
01:05:14.52 --> 01:05:18.84
When he's getting an opportunity to surf he's kind of at malibu because that's where he invested all of his money into a house there

955
01:05:20.20 --> 01:05:22.20
So who won that game?

956
01:05:22.68 --> 01:05:24.68
Well, if you take the infinite game well

957
01:05:24.68 --> 01:05:30.20
Well, what was the goal? Was the goal to make money or was the goal to surf?

958
01:05:32.84 --> 01:05:35.32
So I think the important thing here is

959
01:05:36.44 --> 01:05:38.84
Yeah, there's infinite games and yes, there's

960
01:05:39.40 --> 01:05:44.68
Uh finite games. I think the important thing is to make sure you understand what the rules are

961
01:05:45.32 --> 01:05:52.20
And if possible figure out if there's a way that you can disrupt those rules overcome those rules break those rules for lack of a better work

962
01:05:52.20 --> 01:05:55.64
No, look if there's a legal rule that you're going to get arrested for you're going to lose the game

963
01:05:56.76 --> 01:05:58.76
That's not what i'm talking about

964
01:05:59.32 --> 01:06:01.80
But if you can figure out a way to

965
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
revolutionize

966
01:06:05.16 --> 01:06:11.32
The way something is being done like, you know, you always hear that story about the freaking guy that figured out a better way to do the

967
01:06:11.32 --> 01:06:12.68
high jump

968
01:06:12.68 --> 01:06:20.92
Right fosbury fosbury flop. This guy changed the game. Yeah, right? He didn't he didn't he he changed

969
01:06:20.92 --> 01:06:26.20
He viewed the sport and figured out a way to do that

970
01:06:26.28 --> 01:06:31.72
That's within the rule the technical rules, but it's way outside the the physical

971
01:06:32.68 --> 01:06:35.56
Standards of the way the game was played

972
01:06:36.28 --> 01:06:38.28
totally different

973
01:06:38.28 --> 01:06:40.28
That's a good example

974
01:06:40.76 --> 01:06:47.40
So don't be limited by the rules. See if you can see I don't know what the thing is see if there's a bigger game you can play

975
01:06:47.40 --> 01:06:50.12
Kind of what we just talked about like oh you're a bartender or you're a

976
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.64
Bouncer and you're the head bouncer

977
01:06:54.20 --> 01:06:57.32
Is there a bigger game you can play? Yeah, you can you can open your own bar? Okay?

978
01:06:57.32 --> 01:07:02.44
Well, that's kind of cool. Now. You're not worried about the hierarchy of the bouncers now. You're in a the next level game

979
01:07:03.16 --> 01:07:07.16
But then the next level game is your new franchises. Well now you got a bunch of these you see I'm saying so

980
01:07:07.32 --> 01:07:10.04
I'm always looking and you should always look for

981
01:07:10.76 --> 01:07:12.76
If that's what you want

982
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.40
Is there a bigger game that you can play?

983
01:07:15.40 --> 01:07:20.52
And don't get stuck in a game that you could possibly be losing where you could just be playing a bigger game

984
01:07:21.80 --> 01:07:23.80
Um

985
01:07:23.80 --> 01:07:28.20
Yeah, if you're trying you know you try to be the best restaurant in the best cook in your restaurant

986
01:07:28.20 --> 01:07:32.60
Why not just open your own restaurant trying to be the best electrician so you can get promoted?

987
01:07:34.12 --> 01:07:39.32
And manage a crew well, why not just start your own company that being said

988
01:07:39.72 --> 01:07:41.40
What if you are an electrician?

989
01:07:41.40 --> 01:07:45.56
But you what you really want to do is focus on your family?

990
01:07:46.28 --> 01:07:50.12
Cool, then you stay working at a bigger company because no one call

991
01:07:50.36 --> 01:07:53.96
You know what you know who they call when something goes wrong and you own a business they call you

992
01:07:54.20 --> 01:07:58.20
It's your business. I own a lot of businesses man. The calls come in 24 7

993
01:07:59.08 --> 01:08:01.08
The calls come in 24 7

994
01:08:02.44 --> 01:08:03.24
I

995
01:08:03.24 --> 01:08:05.64
Realize that when we opened victory MMA and fitness. I was like, oh

996
01:08:06.28 --> 01:08:09.32
There's something wrong at the oh instructor didn't show up

997
01:08:09.32 --> 01:08:15.000
Show up cool. I'm on my way. You know like that's the way it's going. Yeah

998
01:08:16.12 --> 01:08:17.80
so

999
01:08:17.80 --> 01:08:21.000
That's uh the way that I think that works

1000
01:08:21.96 --> 01:08:23.96
um

1001
01:08:24.12 --> 01:08:28.92
With the finite I don't think so my point is I don't think it matches or contradicts

1002
01:08:29.80 --> 01:08:35.32
Uh, what james karst said about finite and infinite and what what simon sennig he talks about it as well

1003
01:08:35.32 --> 01:08:39.64
Simon Sennig does he talks about the finite infinite game concept? But

1004
01:08:40.20 --> 01:08:45.72
This stuff what we're saying doesn't match or contradict is just part of it. It's just part of it

1005
01:08:48.20 --> 01:08:50.20
Um next question

1006
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
This is also from levick mix

1007
01:08:53.72 --> 01:08:58.92
How do you with intention periodically check your pro progress within the game? You're playing look you got to detach

1008
01:08:58.92 --> 01:09:03.56
You got to take a step back. You got to track what's happening. You got to write down your goals and see where you're at

1009
01:09:03.56 --> 01:09:07.16
In order to do that you better schedule it because time slips by and next thing you know

1010
01:09:07.16 --> 01:09:10.60
You look up and you've been in the same game for nine years and you realize you haven't been making progress

1011
01:09:10.60 --> 01:09:13.16
So you need to schedule those reviews periodically

1012
01:09:14.68 --> 01:09:16.92
Once every quarter where am I at?

1013
01:09:18.68 --> 01:09:24.28
In the military they in a military they have a position called future operations

1014
01:09:24.28 --> 01:09:26.28
Which is someone that focuses on the future

1015
01:09:26.92 --> 01:09:31.96
You have to put someone there because if you don't put someone focusing on the future then everyone's just focus on what's going on right now

1016
01:09:31.96 --> 01:09:33.96
So pay attention to that

1017
01:09:35.96 --> 01:09:37.96
Um

1018
01:09:39.24 --> 01:09:41.40
The same thing that we have to do with our lives

1019
01:09:42.12 --> 01:09:43.72
You have to

1020
01:09:43.72 --> 01:09:49.40
Become you have to you have to set aside time and make yourself the reviewing officer

1021
01:09:50.36 --> 01:09:52.36
of your

1022
01:09:52.36 --> 01:09:57.80
Progress otherwise you'll look up in four years and you'll realize you haven't moved and you hadn't made progress

1023
01:09:57.80 --> 01:09:59.80
Next one

1024
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.80
How do you know which games are important ones and which ones you can ignore again real quick you got up?

1025
01:10:05.80 --> 01:10:09.000
Okay, you've got to understand what you value. This is important

1026
01:10:09.72 --> 01:10:14.20
Because we talked about return on investment. We talked about what you need to put in we talked about what you're going to get out

1027
01:10:14.20 --> 01:10:16.76
You actually have to be honest with yourself about

1028
01:10:17.80 --> 01:10:19.80
What you value

1029
01:10:20.52 --> 01:10:25.80
And you should probably write down what you value because if you value money or you value money

1030
01:10:25.80 --> 01:10:33.16
Or you value property or you value family or you value friends or you value free time or you value surf trips to

1031
01:10:33.80 --> 01:10:37.08
To Baja and that's what you value better write that down

1032
01:10:38.44 --> 01:10:39.88
Because otherwise

1033
01:10:39.88 --> 01:10:44.36
You might be playing a game where what you're getting rewarded with isn't something that you value

1034
01:10:44.84 --> 01:10:47.56
Hey, we're gonna give you a promotion a new title. I don't give a shit

1035
01:10:49.24 --> 01:10:54.76
Right. Mm. Hey, we're gonna give you a new freaking BMW company car. I don't care

1036
01:10:54.76 --> 01:10:57.32
I want a BMW company car. I want to surf

1037
01:10:57.96 --> 01:10:59.32
Or I want to do jiu-jitsu

1038
01:10:59.32 --> 01:11:04.12
So make sure you know so if you want to know which games are important ones and which ones you should ignore

1039
01:11:04.28 --> 01:11:06.28
You need to figure out what you value

1040
01:11:07.72 --> 01:11:13.32
And then run the ROI and the risk to see if you're getting what you value from this game

1041
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.76
Kobe

1042
01:11:18.76 --> 01:11:20.28
sab

1043
01:11:20.28 --> 01:11:25.000
Next question. He says I stopped lying to myself about my past my regrets and my failures

1044
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:29.64
What then do I need to try to make up for lost time?

1045
01:11:30.36 --> 01:11:32.52
Or is it just about mindset going forward?

1046
01:11:34.28 --> 01:11:35.72
Uh

1047
01:11:35.72 --> 01:11:40.52
Well, we all should try and make up for lost time the problem is we can't

1048
01:11:41.40 --> 01:11:43.40
It's already gone

1049
01:11:43.48 --> 01:11:46.60
It's already gone. Well lost time is gone. It doesn't matter

1050
01:11:46.60 --> 01:11:49.88
So no, we're not gonna focus on that

1051
01:11:50.84 --> 01:11:53.96
We are gonna go forward doing as much as we possibly can

1052
01:11:54.84 --> 01:11:58.92
If you focus on the past and you focus on the lost time and you focus on the regrets

1053
01:12:00.04 --> 01:12:02.04
You're wasting time and energy on

1054
01:12:03.96 --> 01:12:06.92
Things that don't help you and don't move you forward

1055
01:12:08.12 --> 01:12:10.12
So we're not doing that

1056
01:12:10.84 --> 01:12:12.84
Good thing you stop lying yourself. Good job

1057
01:12:12.84 --> 01:12:17.72
You know, you made some mistakes. You made some adjustments move forward. That's what we're doing

1058
01:12:20.20 --> 01:12:23.000
Next one RU Y D raw J

1059
01:12:26.12 --> 01:12:28.12
If games are about winning

1060
01:12:28.52 --> 01:12:33.48
What is the best way to set metrics for winning the game and how important

1061
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:36.44
Would that be?

1062
01:12:36.44 --> 01:12:43.16
The biggest problem here that we're talking about is that people don't know that there's a game being played once you recognize that there's a game being played

1063
01:12:43.64 --> 01:12:45.24
Then yeah, you got to define

1064
01:12:45.24 --> 01:12:47.24
What winning is going to look like

1065
01:12:47.56 --> 01:12:49.56
Then you do that by detaching and looking at it

1066
01:12:50.76 --> 01:12:54.12
And again going back to understanding what you actually value

1067
01:12:54.76 --> 01:12:59.40
And once you know what you value you're going to be able to see the game

1068
01:12:59.40 --> 01:13:01.96
And then you're going to see the game

1069
01:13:01.96 --> 01:13:05.96
And then you're going back to understanding what you actually value

1070
01:13:06.52 --> 01:13:08.52
And once you know what you value and once you see

1071
01:13:09.56 --> 01:13:18.52
What winning looks like then you write down the objectives of what that winning is and then you figure out what the strategy and tactics are to achieve those objectives and victory

1072
01:13:20.36 --> 01:13:24.84
Just like land navigation one of the earlier podcasts we did you have to know where you're going

1073
01:13:25.32 --> 01:13:27.32
You have to know where you're going. If you don't know where you're going

1074
01:13:27.32 --> 01:13:33.32
Then you're going to see where you're going to be and where you're going to be and where you're going to be and where you're going to be

1075
01:13:33.32 --> 01:13:40.12
And then you got to track your progress and see where you are and then see where you are in relation to where you're trying to get to

1076
01:13:43.80 --> 01:13:45.80
Again you have to define winning

1077
01:13:47.72 --> 01:13:52.12
You have to set the metrics because for echo winning might be

1078
01:13:52.12 --> 01:13:57.08
A year for me winning might be making a ton of money

1079
01:13:58.68 --> 01:14:00.68
So we're doing two different things

1080
01:14:02.60 --> 01:14:08.04
So you have to figure out what winning is in order to figure out that out you have to know what you value

1081
01:14:10.76 --> 01:14:12.76
Next one

1082
01:14:12.84 --> 01:14:14.84
Um, this is from Zach

1083
01:14:14.84 --> 01:14:23.08
Heedly headly possible to address being taken advantage of by those who know the game better. It's a tough lesson

1084
01:14:23.08 --> 01:14:25.32
But it happens often especially to young people

1085
01:14:26.92 --> 01:14:30.28
Can you get taken advantage of by people who know that the game better?

1086
01:14:31.24 --> 01:14:32.84
100

1087
01:14:32.84 --> 01:14:36.60
100 percent that's why we're talking about this

1088
01:14:37.48 --> 01:14:40.12
Because there's nothing worse than being in a game

1089
01:14:40.12 --> 01:14:47.000
With someone that knows the game and you don't you know where they know the game better than you or you don't recognize that you're in a game

1090
01:14:47.72 --> 01:14:51.16
So when you get no fight with someone that knows jiu-jitsu and you don't you get smashed

1091
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:54.52
We came home from deployment

1092
01:14:55.80 --> 01:14:57.64
and

1093
01:14:57.64 --> 01:15:02.68
There was you know discussions and debates about what we were doing and the types of mission we were doing

1094
01:15:03.08 --> 01:15:05.88
and what there was one particular senior officer

1095
01:15:07.24 --> 01:15:08.68
and

1096
01:15:08.68 --> 01:15:10.20
I told

1097
01:15:10.20 --> 01:15:14.28
stoner and leif I said hey do not get into a debate with this guy

1098
01:15:15.32 --> 01:15:17.32
about our deployment

1099
01:15:17.96 --> 01:15:19.96
And they were like why not and I was like because he'll beat you

1100
01:15:20.84 --> 01:15:24.44
He'll beat you in a day. He'll beat me. I'm like I'm not going to debate this stuff with him. He

1101
01:15:25.32 --> 01:15:29.88
He does what he does. He's one of those people that goes around and

1102
01:15:30.44 --> 01:15:34.12
Would you step into the arena with someone that debates all the time?

1103
01:15:35.16 --> 01:15:37.16
You're not going to do well

1104
01:15:37.16 --> 01:15:41.32
It's like when you see the college kid getting a debate with ben Shapiro and he's got

1105
01:15:42.20 --> 01:15:44.20
74 facts that he rattles off

1106
01:15:44.92 --> 01:15:48.20
Because he had this argument at nine other places in the past two weeks

1107
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.96
So they're getting in the ring with him. It's not you know, like they're not it doesn't end well

1108
01:15:55.32 --> 01:15:56.60
um

1109
01:15:56.60 --> 01:15:58.12
so

1110
01:15:58.12 --> 01:16:02.76
That's why you have to do an honest assessment of yourself

1111
01:16:02.76 --> 01:16:09.80
And you have to recognize that if someone is beating you in the game and you can't contend with them

1112
01:16:09.96 --> 01:16:13.16
You better find an exit strategy to get out of that game

1113
01:16:14.60 --> 01:16:17.48
Unless you go, okay, you know how to take some hits here, but I'm gonna learn that's okay

1114
01:16:17.80 --> 01:16:22.36
As long as you recognize that and you don't get taken advantage of the point where you get left, you know left for dead

1115
01:16:26.36 --> 01:16:28.36
Next one's from logan buil

1116
01:16:28.36 --> 01:16:32.92
BUHL how often should you be assessing if you're winning the long game?

1117
01:16:33.64 --> 01:16:38.68
How should you view the small games that seem meaningless that involve or impact the long game?

1118
01:16:38.68 --> 01:16:42.12
Look, we should be thinking strategic all the time all the time

1119
01:16:42.28 --> 01:16:47.40
We should be thinking about the long game all the time and we should not be playing games that don't move you towards this strategic goal

1120
01:16:49.56 --> 01:16:51.56
Does this mean don't

1121
01:16:51.56 --> 01:16:57.000
Don't uh ever watch a tv show because it's not helping your strategic goal

1122
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.08
Well, no if you if you need a little downtime and the tv show helps you relax cool. Go ahead. Watch your freaking show

1123
01:17:09.72 --> 01:17:12.60
But that's not a game right that's a break and it's a strategic

1124
01:17:12.68 --> 01:17:18.20
But it's a tactical break that's gonna actually give you you know allow you to refresh your mindset and be ready for work and

1125
01:17:18.20 --> 01:17:22.76
blah blah blah now look if you're watching freaking uh netflix six hours a day

1126
01:17:22.76 --> 01:17:26.44
You got issues. Yeah, we're not doing that. No

1127
01:17:28.28 --> 01:17:33.72
So you should be thinking all the time. This is very this is a really good question. Of course, we address this question a lot

1128
01:17:35.08 --> 01:17:37.08
Think about the games that you're playing

1129
01:17:37.48 --> 01:17:42.52
And if you're playing games that don't help your big game your strategic game

1130
01:17:43.40 --> 01:17:45.40
You should not be wasting time with them

1131
01:17:47.16 --> 01:17:49.16
That's it

1132
01:17:49.24 --> 01:17:51.24
That's it

1133
01:17:51.24 --> 01:17:55.48
All of your games that you're playing should help your long term strategic goals

1134
01:17:57.80 --> 01:18:02.52
And and look if you got time and you happen to love freaking backgammon

1135
01:18:03.56 --> 01:18:08.04
And you get some satisfaction by playing backgammon and you want to go play that literal game

1136
01:18:08.84 --> 01:18:13.72
And you do it, you know once in uh two hours on sundays with your little friends

1137
01:18:14.20 --> 01:18:16.76
Cool, that's nothing wrong with that. That's cool. Have fun with that

1138
01:18:17.88 --> 01:18:19.88
That's fine. I'm not talking about that

1139
01:18:19.88 --> 01:18:21.88
I'm talking about your

1140
01:18:23.72 --> 01:18:25.56
Doing things

1141
01:18:25.56 --> 01:18:31.000
You're going out thursday friday saturday night going out looking for a girl going out looking for a dude

1142
01:18:31.64 --> 01:18:34.20
Right, and that's what you're doing thursday friday. You're drinking

1143
01:18:34.92 --> 01:18:36.92
But you're in that game

1144
01:18:37.40 --> 01:18:39.88
You're wasting money you're hurting your health

1145
01:18:41.08 --> 01:18:43.96
And by the way, if you think you're gonna meet the love of your life

1146
01:18:44.68 --> 01:18:46.68
There's better ways

1147
01:18:47.32 --> 01:18:48.92
Than in the pub

1148
01:18:48.92 --> 01:18:50.92
No, I did happen to meet my wife

1149
01:18:54.12 --> 01:18:57.64
So I guess there's a little except maybe you know, but we're not going to dedicate

1150
01:18:58.28 --> 01:19:00.28
We'll be careful about this one

1151
01:19:01.96 --> 01:19:07.56
We're gonna be careful about that one. Yeah, we're gonna be careful. Hey at a certain point the ROI, right? Okay, so this is what'll happen

1152
01:19:08.84 --> 01:19:12.92
You do be you've been doing this thursday friday saturday night drinking spending money

1153
01:19:14.12 --> 01:19:15.80
year

1154
01:19:15.80 --> 01:19:20.04
Two years two years you're looking around going hold on a second here, man. Three years. You're like wait a second

1155
01:19:20.44 --> 01:19:22.44
I haven't made any progress

1156
01:19:22.76 --> 01:19:25.40
Then it's time to may assess what the hell you're doing

1157
01:19:26.60 --> 01:19:27.80
so

1158
01:19:27.80 --> 01:19:33.16
Those tactical games that you're playing they've got to support your long-term strategic goals

1159
01:19:33.88 --> 01:19:41.08
That's it a long game. I like the idea of uh, like little like you mentioned backgammon, right where which is funny

1160
01:19:41.08 --> 01:19:46.36
I don't know. That's a that's a total jocco example. I don't even like I don't even understand backgammon

1161
01:19:46.60 --> 01:19:50.28
Yeah, I can this weird boat board with like a little long triangles on it, right? Yeah

1162
01:19:51.16 --> 01:19:53.16
Yeah, they're fun

1163
01:19:53.16 --> 01:19:59.88
But no a lot of those especially the old school a board games. They're actually good little micro like exercises for your mind

1164
01:20:00.12 --> 01:20:03.80
So like, you know, you you subscribe to dr. Luke, right?

1165
01:20:04.44 --> 01:20:06.92
Yeah, look on instagram on his thing. So he he he

1166
01:20:06.92 --> 01:20:12.68
He man, he'll put out some really good stuff little tidbits, right? So one of them was this thing about balance

1167
01:20:13.32 --> 01:20:16.36
Or he's like, yeah, just work on your balance and they think he's like on a curb or something

1168
01:20:16.44 --> 01:20:20.28
I don't know. I forget what he was doing, but he was like just talking about balance physical your physical

1169
01:20:20.60 --> 01:20:27.24
Balance proprioception just so he's like, yeah, if you improve that that decreases all cause mortality

1170
01:20:27.40 --> 01:20:34.84
Oh, just maintaining, you know that that and it has a lot to do with like, you know, your your neurotransmitters and your neurons and stuff

1171
01:20:34.84 --> 01:20:37.08
Like that in your brain. I don't know above my whole thing

1172
01:20:37.08 --> 01:20:43.24
But nonetheless explains it real simple and it's like man if you think about especially those old school games

1173
01:20:43.56 --> 01:20:50.20
Like that's kind of what they do if you if that's your downtime like batgammon. It's like, wow, that's kind of a solid one

1174
01:20:50.28 --> 01:20:55.72
Running numbers in your head. There's strategy. There's bath. There's like all these little things that give your brain this good

1175
01:20:55.80 --> 01:20:58.52
Actually, this good essentially exercise for your brain

1176
01:20:59.32 --> 01:21:01.56
Again, all those things all those things are important

1177
01:21:01.56 --> 01:21:08.28
Uh, you know learning new things they say that's really important, you know, just for keeping your mind fresh

1178
01:21:08.52 --> 01:21:10.52
Yeah, um, no if if you're

1179
01:21:11.64 --> 01:21:17.000
Me if you're stressed out and you need to know, you know, the current champ of batgammon

1180
01:21:17.56 --> 01:21:21.56
You know and you're following his life and maybe that could go into toxic, you know

1181
01:21:21.96 --> 01:21:23.96
The toxic zone for sure

1182
01:21:24.36 --> 01:21:28.20
As far as bro, if there's someone that's wrecked their life playing backgammon, I want to meet them

1183
01:21:28.20 --> 01:21:35.24
If there's someone that went too hard in backgammon, yeah, so I think I think like in a way

1184
01:21:35.32 --> 01:21:38.68
It's kind of it's a lot like surfing is you know when you take a break from the grind

1185
01:21:38.84 --> 01:21:43.48
You know stuff that you need a break from and then you go like do something like surfing where it's obvious

1186
01:21:43.56 --> 01:21:48.68
Oh, well surfing is conducive to your life. It's not like sitting on the couch watching reality

1187
01:21:48.76 --> 01:21:51.16
It's healthier working on your balance. Exactly right

1188
01:21:51.24 --> 01:21:55.40
But playing games searching games are the same exact thing just more for your brain

1189
01:21:55.48 --> 01:21:56.76
What about video games?

1190
01:21:56.76 --> 01:21:58.76
Well, it depends on what video game

1191
01:21:58.92 --> 01:22:01.88
That's what they say you go deep you can go deep looking into that

1192
01:22:02.04 --> 01:22:04.92
Then you'll see if you'll find all kinds of benefits with certain kinds of games

1193
01:22:05.08 --> 01:22:09.48
What kind of games are good for you video games? I don't know. I didn't go that deep, but everyone's no

1194
01:22:10.68 --> 01:22:13.32
You'll see little articles on like how I get it all

1195
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:17.08
That was the least step ever

1196
01:22:17.80 --> 01:22:21.24
That's true, but no, you know, you can like find articles or whatever

1197
01:22:21.88 --> 01:22:24.20
That we'll say oh benefits of playing video games

1198
01:22:24.20 --> 01:22:29.64
Then it'll have like, you know hand-eye this and that and then you know, then you find out. Yes. It's certain kinds of games

1199
01:22:30.28 --> 01:22:32.28
And then you have all these secondary

1200
01:22:32.28 --> 01:22:33.24
Uh

1201
01:22:33.24 --> 01:22:37.72
Benefits as well like, you know, especially the like the shooter games that you're connected to your friends or whatever and other

1202
01:22:37.80 --> 01:22:41.40
Like, you know towns or whatever or the internet you ever play that stuff? No

1203
01:22:42.20 --> 01:22:45.08
Yeah, I guess there's little secondary benefits of that social

1204
01:22:45.40 --> 01:22:49.64
Yeah, yeah, yeah like yeah, that was weird during co vid when kids were like

1205
01:22:49.64 --> 01:22:56.76
The parents were we're saying hey, don't play video games all day and they're like, but this is the only way I have friends, right?

1206
01:22:56.76 --> 01:23:00.68
Yeah, that was the thing. Yeah, we I don't have video game like console at my house

1207
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.36
So that wasn't happening at my house. Yeah, because I don't have that stuff

1208
01:23:04.44 --> 01:23:08.92
But I saw other parents were saying that to their their kids were like they were talking to me about it like

1209
01:23:09.16 --> 01:23:12.04
Well, they feel bad with your kids not with your kids playing video games

1210
01:23:12.12 --> 01:23:15.64
I think my kids don't play video games. Yeah, because we don't have the thing. Yeah

1211
01:23:15.64 --> 01:23:19.64
Yeah, but and not to say that's ideal. I'm you know, not necessarily

1212
01:23:19.72 --> 01:23:23.48
No, maybe it was bad. Maybe I should have given them more social connection, but you know, come on

1213
01:23:23.88 --> 01:23:27.72
Well, yeah, I don't think you can send again. I don't know brown. I'm not a psychologist

1214
01:23:27.88 --> 01:23:31.72
You know this about me that where I would but I do think that

1215
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:38.12
Social connection is going to be most optimized person to person. I would think that's why that's through a screen

1216
01:23:38.36 --> 01:23:43.48
That's why that's you just was good. I think that's one of the many many many benefits of it. Yes. It's weird, man

1217
01:23:43.48 --> 01:23:47.08
Jiu-Jitsu is connected. Yeah, good time. Like it's

1218
01:23:47.88 --> 01:23:49.88
you're like

1219
01:23:49.96 --> 01:23:55.32
Connected you ever in your difference. So I don't know but you're smashing someone like and they're smashing you

1220
01:23:55.56 --> 01:24:00.28
Yeah, it's it's a it's a radical thing. So, you know when you meet someone and like you shake their hand or whatever

1221
01:24:00.36 --> 01:24:03.64
And then let's say you're just standing somewhere. It's like you don't know I'm that good

1222
01:24:03.64 --> 01:24:07.96
So you're kind of trying to keep your boundaries, you know the bubble, you know the physical in the bubble, right?

1223
01:24:08.04 --> 01:24:10.36
You're what do you call it personal personal space?

1224
01:24:10.36 --> 01:24:12.36
Yeah, I know

1225
01:24:13.80 --> 01:24:17.64
But you know when you meet someone new you want to respect personal space a little bit you're more sensitive to that

1226
01:24:17.80 --> 01:24:18.76
I guess, you know

1227
01:24:18.76 --> 01:24:24.60
Bro, when you roll with the guy in jiu-jitsu like it kind of just diss it's like they don't even you don't even have a bubble anymore

1228
01:24:24.68 --> 01:24:27.64
You don't have personal space. Yeah, even like when you're not rolling

1229
01:24:27.64 --> 01:24:33.24
It's funny. So like like you or like the guys who I always roll with you Greg noah like these guys like

1230
01:24:33.56 --> 01:24:37.64
I remember one time I was talking to noah and I was like, bro. I'm really close to noah right now

1231
01:24:37.64 --> 01:24:40.68
It's almost like I could engage it because I'm so used to rolling with them, you know

1232
01:24:40.92 --> 01:24:43.40
So like the personal space is like completely gone

1233
01:24:43.96 --> 01:24:47.000
And I think it's in a good way, but I guess that could depend on who you are

1234
01:24:47.88 --> 01:24:49.72
check

1235
01:24:49.72 --> 01:24:51.88
All right, so yes long game all the time

1236
01:24:52.60 --> 01:24:57.88
Caleb smith 547. How do I how how do how do you know?

1237
01:24:58.20 --> 01:24:59.80
How do I know when it's time to quit the game?

1238
01:24:59.96 --> 01:25:04.44
What are the symptoms of a game played that will ultimately lead to the invent inevitable loss of time money?

1239
01:25:04.44 --> 01:25:11.000
Uh, go it goes back to what we were talking about ROI. Be honest honest assessments. This is the sunk cost fallacy, right?

1240
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
This is exactly what you brought up earlier

1241
01:25:13.48 --> 01:25:15.48
um

1242
01:25:16.20 --> 01:25:17.40
Okay, so

1243
01:25:17.40 --> 01:25:21.48
Again, some of these questions are a little bit repetitive, but I want to add some items to them

1244
01:25:22.12 --> 01:25:26.68
This one here if you want to know when it's time to quit the game and what are the symptoms

1245
01:25:27.56 --> 01:25:31.56
It can be good in some scenarios to set up triggers

1246
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:33.56
For action

1247
01:25:33.56 --> 01:25:37.96
And this is the example of this is like, you know when guys are climbing a mountain like Mount Everest or whatever?

1248
01:25:38.68 --> 01:25:44.60
And they say hey if we haven't gotten to this point by 10 o'clock in the morning, we're turning around and going back

1249
01:25:44.68 --> 01:25:50.76
There's no we're not debating it. There's no there's no emotion around it 10 o'clock if we're not here

1250
01:25:50.76 --> 01:25:52.76
We're turning around we're going back down

1251
01:25:53.32 --> 01:25:55.32
You can do that with

1252
01:25:55.88 --> 01:25:57.88
The game that you're going to get involved in

1253
01:25:57.88 --> 01:26:01.48
You can hey, I'm going to only spend this amount of money. I'm only going to spend this amount of time

1254
01:26:02.44 --> 01:26:07.16
I'm going to at least if I'm not making this kind of return on investment like hey, I'm going to start driving

1255
01:26:07.16 --> 01:26:09.16
You know Uber at night

1256
01:26:09.56 --> 01:26:13.80
And I think that way I can get some more money, you know for for my down payment on my house

1257
01:26:14.52 --> 01:26:16.52
Well, then you realize that your ROI

1258
01:26:17.64 --> 01:26:23.64
Driving around your uber is not as much as you thought it was going to be. Hey, I'm not even meeting the minimums. This isn't working. I'm not going to do it

1259
01:26:24.76 --> 01:26:26.76
So

1260
01:26:26.76 --> 01:26:35.24
So figure out what the minimum required return is figure out how much time you're going to invest and put a cap on that figure

1261
01:26:35.24 --> 01:26:41.40
How much money you're going to invest and put a cap on that and then you and then you have the actions in places you're going to take

1262
01:26:43.32 --> 01:26:48.04
So when that happens that event gets triggered. Hey, I'm going to you know invest in

1263
01:26:49.64 --> 01:26:51.64
Trying to start up this little company

1264
01:26:51.64 --> 01:26:57.000
If I haven't you know, if I don't have 20 clients by the first three months

1265
01:26:57.96 --> 01:27:01.000
Obviously, there's not a market for it and I'm going to stop. Okay, cool

1266
01:27:02.04 --> 01:27:05.40
And then you stick with look if you get to 19 you're like, well, I'm close. Okay, cool

1267
01:27:05.48 --> 01:27:07.48
You know, you can you can make a little adjustment

1268
01:27:07.72 --> 01:27:11.000
But if you're at 13 that's been three months and you thought you're gonna have 20

1269
01:27:12.12 --> 01:27:16.28
Then you've made a bunch of adjustments trying to figure out the market and you're not there. Okay. You need to walk away

1270
01:27:16.76 --> 01:27:18.04
so

1271
01:27:18.04 --> 01:27:19.56
That would be

1272
01:27:19.56 --> 01:27:24.44
The thing to set up so that you recognize the symptoms prior to

1273
01:27:25.24 --> 01:27:26.68
because otherwise

1274
01:27:26.68 --> 01:27:28.68
If you don't have triggers in place

1275
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.52
That's how you end up at the top of ever so you're out of oxygen and it's freaking dark

1276
01:27:33.08 --> 01:27:34.04
And you're gonna die

1277
01:27:34.04 --> 01:27:40.20
That's how you end up without any money left in your bank account and you don't have a successful business and now you got to sell your house

1278
01:27:41.32 --> 01:27:44.20
This is how it happens. You don't put triggers in place

1279
01:27:45.56 --> 01:27:47.56
And it causes problems

1280
01:27:47.56 --> 01:27:50.68
And you're like, oh, I'm gonna go to the next one

1281
01:27:50.68 --> 01:27:51.56
Next one

1282
01:27:51.56 --> 01:27:52.92
Chedida

1283
01:27:52.92 --> 01:27:53.96
Chedidia

1284
01:27:53.96 --> 01:27:55.96
Or maybe it's Chad Idia

1285
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.20
What direction you go if you realize the games you are playing are unwinnable

1286
01:28:00.20 --> 01:28:04.52
But you don't have the ability to leave and if you did you don't know the game to take on next

1287
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Asking for a friend

1288
01:28:08.28 --> 01:28:09.48
Listen

1289
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:12.60
When we get into a game that's unwinnable

1290
01:28:13.32 --> 01:28:16.92
We don't have the ability to leave. Okay, we'll figure out the next strategy

1291
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:21.48
Right, you can figure out, okay, this job. I've been here forever. They pay me good money, but it's absolutely awful

1292
01:28:21.48 --> 01:28:23.56
I'm never getting promoted and I don't want to do it anymore. Okay

1293
01:28:24.44 --> 01:28:27.64
You can't leave tomorrow. You can't leave next week. You can't leave in a month

1294
01:28:28.04 --> 01:28:32.76
But you can over time a year two years three years figure out an exit strategy

1295
01:28:34.44 --> 01:28:36.12
And

1296
01:28:36.12 --> 01:28:42.20
Make a move we're not doing brash moves, right? We're not making emotional decisions. We're gonna take our time

1297
01:28:42.20 --> 01:28:46.92
How to get out of this game and then also take our time figure out what game to play next

1298
01:28:48.44 --> 01:28:50.44
To do a class on

1299
01:28:52.52 --> 01:28:54.28
Knitting

1300
01:28:54.28 --> 01:28:59.48
And you're like, dude, this is awesome. I love the way this feels to make the scarf and like I want to do sweaters

1301
01:28:59.48 --> 01:29:04.28
And okay, we'll go do some more of that. Maybe you're gonna end up selling sweaters on Etsy

1302
01:29:06.20 --> 01:29:07.88
Cool

1303
01:29:07.88 --> 01:29:11.24
Or you take a knitting class you're like, this is monotonous and I hate it. Okay, cool

1304
01:29:11.24 --> 01:29:13.88
Well, let's take some time to figure out the new game

1305
01:29:14.44 --> 01:29:19.56
Little iterative decisions and also multiple reconnaissance probes

1306
01:29:20.60 --> 01:29:22.60
There's so many opportunities out there in the world

1307
01:29:23.24 --> 01:29:26.36
There's so many of them and not all of them are good opportunities, by the way

1308
01:29:26.92 --> 01:29:30.36
Some of them might seem cool, but they're a lot harder than they look like

1309
01:29:31.88 --> 01:29:33.88
Some of them are

1310
01:29:34.36 --> 01:29:39.32
Harder than they look like but they're not that bad and you can make some good money and you can be gratified by doing it

1311
01:29:39.32 --> 01:29:44.52
So do multiple reconnaissance like oh you like knitting cool try a little bit of knitting

1312
01:29:44.84 --> 01:29:51.96
You also like making candles cool make some candles. You also like pouring concrete. Okay. Well, let's see what's going on with that

1313
01:29:53.64 --> 01:29:59.000
Maybe on the weekends you start pouring a little concrete doing some little projects for people for real cheap and you realize you're good at it

1314
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.16
Maybe realize you suck at it, which is also possible

1315
01:30:01.16 --> 01:30:08.36
So do reconnaissance of multiple opportunities that are out there

1316
01:30:10.04 --> 01:30:12.04
Then you make your decision

1317
01:30:12.60 --> 01:30:15.24
And then you have that extra strategy to execute

1318
01:30:17.40 --> 01:30:20.52
Next one is from renais christine

1319
01:30:22.04 --> 01:30:27.24
Maybe you can talk about the thought process you go through in order to turn something hard into a game

1320
01:30:27.24 --> 01:30:31.64
Well, yeah when I'm doing something really hard, I'm gonna find some little achievable goals

1321
01:30:32.84 --> 01:30:36.52
Little achievable goals that lean towards a strategic victory

1322
01:30:38.20 --> 01:30:40.76
Maybe set up some rewards for me for my team

1323
01:30:42.20 --> 01:30:44.20
And then execute on those little things

1324
01:30:46.04 --> 01:30:48.04
I think

1325
01:30:48.44 --> 01:30:50.44
That

1326
01:30:50.44 --> 01:30:57.16
That mindset of like I'm literally gonna have fun with this thing that sucks goes a long way. Yeah. Oh, yeah

1327
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.68
So I don't have that's my process like oh, yeah, this sucks

1328
01:31:02.84 --> 01:31:07.24
You know another thing is this sucks and I'm never gonna let it be know that I think it sucks

1329
01:31:09.40 --> 01:31:10.44
I'm doing something horrible

1330
01:31:10.44 --> 01:31:13.24
But I'm never gonna tell anybody and I'm actually gonna make them think I love it

1331
01:31:13.24 --> 01:31:17.16
They're gonna think I'm crazy. I kind of have fun with that. That's fun for me. I just turned it into a game

1332
01:31:17.72 --> 01:31:19.64
That's such a good game. It's a good game

1333
01:31:19.64 --> 01:31:21.64
So, um

1334
01:31:22.12 --> 01:31:27.48
So when I swim in the pool my kids and nowadays it's kind of colder than normal

1335
01:31:27.72 --> 01:31:31.48
Okay, look cold that means a lot of different things for different people. I understand and I am from koi

1336
01:31:31.48 --> 01:31:35.56
So I understand that going into the store for you. It's like under 70

1337
01:31:36.52 --> 01:31:41.88
So I would say it's about 55 degrees. Okay. That's cold. Yeah, that's legit cold

1338
01:31:42.04 --> 01:31:47.08
So I jump in my daughter can stand cold like she don't care. Yeah cold does not bother her

1339
01:31:47.08 --> 01:31:49.80
Here's the thing my son. He don't like that. He doesn't like cold

1340
01:31:50.52 --> 01:31:51.48
So

1341
01:31:51.48 --> 01:31:56.20
We'll jump in and I'll jump in first and she'll be like is it go. I'll be like, oh, it's so warm. Meanwhile. I'm like, bro

1342
01:31:56.20 --> 01:31:57.80
This is cool

1343
01:31:57.80 --> 01:32:02.84
And I'm like, oh, it's so warm. It's almost too warm, you know, like that kind right and they're like all believe in the more convincing

1344
01:32:02.84 --> 01:32:04.68
I can be meanwhile. I'm trying not to shiver, you know

1345
01:32:05.32 --> 01:32:08.60
And it's like it it almost like physically feels warmer

1346
01:32:08.92 --> 01:32:14.60
I'm saying like it's like the game kind of filters in the the bad stimulus turns it into like a different stimulus

1347
01:32:14.60 --> 01:32:18.92
Bro, that's a good one. They're there to act like oh, this isn't even a fat one. Like what I didn't even notice

1348
01:32:19.08 --> 01:32:22.36
I didn't even notice how cold it was. Buds, they would say false motivation is better than no motivation

1349
01:32:22.84 --> 01:32:24.84
It's kind of true, right?

1350
01:32:26.04 --> 01:32:30.20
There's a girl a lady named Jane McGonigal. She talks about gamification

1351
01:32:30.20 --> 01:32:32.92
It's an actual process where you take hard stuff

1352
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.52
You turn them into little games and you get through them like, you know, you you thrive

1353
01:32:36.84 --> 01:32:39.56
Whatever and she did it because she had an illness. I forget the illness

1354
01:32:39.56 --> 01:32:45.24
And she was like, hey, I'm gonna turn this whole thing. This is my whole recovery process, which was super arduous process

1355
01:32:45.88 --> 01:32:52.84
I'm gonna turn this recovery process into a series of games and that's how she started on the path of like understanding gamification

1356
01:32:53.16 --> 01:32:58.28
But um, there's an actual process to it and it's like apparently it's super super effective

1357
01:32:59.24 --> 01:33:01.24
Let's do one more

1358
01:33:01.24 --> 01:33:06.04
And then we're we'll go and do another one. Um, because I got a bunch more of these things to cover

1359
01:33:06.04 --> 01:33:09.72
But let's do one more. This is kind of a little bit of a chunky one

1360
01:33:11.72 --> 01:33:15.32
This is from Santos Carlos the third

1361
01:33:17.32 --> 01:33:25.000
When solid honorable hardworking men refuse to play the game because quote there shouldn't be a game

1362
01:33:27.24 --> 01:33:33.56
How to navigate the dichotomy and dogma around progression as tenure

1363
01:33:33.56 --> 01:33:41.56
Versus progression through experience. This is a little bit tricky of uh, of a question to understand

1364
01:33:41.56 --> 01:33:44.52
But I'm gonna do my best with it and there's he says context

1365
01:33:45.08 --> 01:33:49.72
Some of the most knowledgeable talented and experienced people I've worked with

1366
01:33:50.84 --> 01:33:55.08
Were both years and decades younger in tenure

1367
01:33:55.64 --> 01:34:01.08
However, they spent so much time consistently exposing themselves to challenging problems

1368
01:34:01.08 --> 01:34:05.72
They progressed well beyond the 99 percentile anyone their age

1369
01:34:07.08 --> 01:34:12.36
So that's the that's the dogma around progression is tenure versus progression through experience

1370
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
So it's time versus

1371
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.60
That's really about effort because experience is sort of wrapped around time. So let's answer that

1372
01:34:21.80 --> 01:34:27.08
Uh people that engage and train and practice and challenge themselves will get better than people that don't

1373
01:34:27.08 --> 01:34:29.08
The

1374
01:34:29.08 --> 01:34:31.08
And so there's a dogma. He's like

1375
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:33.96
The dogma around that

1376
01:34:34.52 --> 01:34:37.000
And I think what he's trying to ask is like the negative

1377
01:34:37.96 --> 01:34:39.48
What the negative

1378
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:41.48
impression of people that

1379
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:48.04
Work really hard don't have much time, but they're excelling. That's what I'm getting from this question. I hope I've I hope I've got it

1380
01:34:51.88 --> 01:34:53.88
Uh

1381
01:34:53.88 --> 01:35:00.36
The reason that that sometimes hurts people that are like let's say echo checked on board

1382
01:35:00.36 --> 01:35:03.000
He hasn't been here for very long, but he's really kind of kicking ass

1383
01:35:03.72 --> 01:35:07.64
And yet I kind of hold it against him. Why is that? There's a decent chance

1384
01:35:09.24 --> 01:35:11.24
That echo echo has the

1385
01:35:12.12 --> 01:35:16.20
He's exposing himself. He's training hard. He's putting himself in challenging positions

1386
01:35:16.20 --> 01:35:22.04
So he's learning a lot and he's doing really well, but echo doesn't have the maturity and tact to remain humble

1387
01:35:22.04 --> 01:35:27.000
So you end up creating an antagonistic relationship with me because

1388
01:35:27.56 --> 01:35:33.88
I'm looking at you like oh, he's just one of these people that's trying so hard and I'm gonna look for every little opportunity to hurt your progress

1389
01:35:35.64 --> 01:35:36.92
So

1390
01:35:36.92 --> 01:35:39.64
If you want to overcome the way that works

1391
01:35:40.36 --> 01:35:45.56
Or you want to help someone, you know, you get some new guy on your team that checks in that is really doing a good job

1392
01:35:45.56 --> 01:35:47.56
But it's rubbing people the wrong way

1393
01:35:47.80 --> 01:35:51.48
Just talk to him about staying humble and it's talking about the important

1394
01:35:51.48 --> 01:35:53.48
of building good relationships

1395
01:35:54.68 --> 01:35:56.68
And that will be helpful

1396
01:35:57.40 --> 01:35:59.08
so

1397
01:35:59.08 --> 01:36:02.04
I hope that answers the first question again. These are a little bit uh

1398
01:36:02.84 --> 01:36:05.80
A little bit I didn't quite fully understand them

1399
01:36:06.52 --> 01:36:09.40
The the second question is an observation more than a question

1400
01:36:09.72 --> 01:36:17.08
But it's interesting how many miss the opportunity of chasing forward looking asymmetrical opportunities opportunities with limited risk

1401
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:23.64
But potential huge upsides and a relative solid likelihood of success. Why is that?

1402
01:36:24.20 --> 01:36:26.20
So why do people

1403
01:36:26.52 --> 01:36:28.52
miss opportunities

1404
01:36:29.40 --> 01:36:30.84
That have low risk

1405
01:36:30.84 --> 01:36:35.08
And I think there's a couple reasons number one is failure to recognize like they just don't see them

1406
01:36:35.40 --> 01:36:39.24
And because they don't detach and so that opportunities right in front of them. They don't see it

1407
01:36:41.16 --> 01:36:43.88
You know, that's the old experiment where the freaking

1408
01:36:43.88 --> 01:36:49.000
Gorilla goes walking through the people that are throwing the basketball and like no one sees it

1409
01:36:49.40 --> 01:36:52.52
Because they're in they're watching the counting the numbers and they don't see this obvious thing

1410
01:36:52.60 --> 01:36:55.16
So there's a failure to recognize because people don't detach enough

1411
01:36:56.68 --> 01:37:02.52
And they don't top of that sometimes they see the opportunity, but they don't want even a limited risk

1412
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:11.56
They don't want to take even a small risk with a big reward. They don't want to take it. We see that all the time humans don't like

1413
01:37:11.56 --> 01:37:17.80
Humans tend to not want to take action and humans tend not to want to take risk

1414
01:37:20.36 --> 01:37:21.80
I is not all humans

1415
01:37:21.80 --> 01:37:28.76
Let me let me rephrase that there are many humans that don't like to take action and there are many humans that don't like to take risk

1416
01:37:30.76 --> 01:37:34.44
And so when they're presented an opportunity, but they're gonna have to do something a little bit different and they're gonna have to take risk

1417
01:37:34.44 --> 01:37:36.44
They're just like I almost keep doing what I'm doing

1418
01:37:36.44 --> 01:37:40.36
So I think that is why that happens

1419
01:37:41.96 --> 01:37:44.76
So there you go Santos. I hope I was able to kind of

1420
01:37:46.44 --> 01:37:49.96
Get those for you and uh with that to game for this time

1421
01:37:50.04 --> 01:37:53.72
I guess we're gonna have to do one more podcast about the game the game the games

1422
01:37:54.20 --> 01:37:56.20
Here we are in the meantime

1423
01:37:56.52 --> 01:38:02.60
If you want to play the health game the fitness game the being better game the stronger faster better game

1424
01:38:03.24 --> 01:38:05.24
Better get the jockel fuel game

1425
01:38:05.24 --> 01:38:07.96
The jockel fuel.com we got moke

1426
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:15.40
Which is we got ready to drink moke right now, which is fire different level different fire fire slaps

1427
01:38:15.80 --> 01:38:21.24
Big oh it slaps big time. You like you you open your fridge. Maybe you could you know have a piece of steak

1428
01:38:21.64 --> 01:38:24.36
Maybe you could have some uh mozzarella

1429
01:38:25.08 --> 01:38:31.16
Sure, hell. Yeah mozzarella mozzarella with the virgin olive oil on it. Oh what those little things

1430
01:38:31.16 --> 01:38:35.000
Yeah, yeah, put a little basil on it. Yeah, that's the kind of thing

1431
01:38:35.56 --> 01:38:40.92
Sarah made those the other day like two days in a row. Yeah, those are good, but there's a I'm look

1432
01:38:41.88 --> 01:38:44.44
I'm gonna put myself on report for being lazy. Yes, sir

1433
01:38:44.52 --> 01:38:47.48
But there's like, you know, you're cutting basil leafs whatever

1434
01:38:47.96 --> 01:38:52.04
You're getting the oil out. You're making a plate. Oh that moke is just sitting there ready

1435
01:38:52.12 --> 01:38:56.60
Yeah, 30 grams of protein ready to go down the hatch. Tasty tastes better than mozzarella

1436
01:38:56.60 --> 01:39:03.24
Yeah, I mean this is a given. So we got the ready drink moke. We got the powder moke. We got

1437
01:39:04.04 --> 01:39:06.04
joint warfare super krill

1438
01:39:08.44 --> 01:39:14.12
Um cold war got it all and we got the energy drinks. Yeah, we got the energy drinks

1439
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:15.96
So

1440
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:21.000
But these aren't the normal energy drinks that make you sick and make you diabetic and are poison. No, these are not those

1441
01:39:21.24 --> 01:39:23.88
In the store are these in the health

1442
01:39:23.88 --> 01:39:29.40
Department bro, this is a good point the you when you go into a store when you go to vitamin shop

1443
01:39:29.48 --> 01:39:34.44
Well vitamin shop, they're there and pretty easy to find but when you go into like a military commissary you go into hanniford

1444
01:39:34.44 --> 01:39:38.28
You go into h e b or murphys or or myer

1445
01:39:39.88 --> 01:39:45.56
In some of these stores, they're in like the health and wellness section. They're not in the energy drink section

1446
01:39:46.12 --> 01:39:51.32
So just be advised. Yeah, that's kind of interesting, right? What's that? I mean the conundrum, right?

1447
01:39:51.32 --> 01:39:53.80
Uh from a store standpoint or from a what do you call customer?

1448
01:39:53.88 --> 01:39:56.44
Well from a customer say well from a store standpoint, they're like, oh

1449
01:39:56.52 --> 01:40:01.72
Well, this energy drink will put over in the energy drinks section because it's it's all these are the same, right?

1450
01:40:02.20 --> 01:40:06.04
But we also have a health and wellness things that make you better. Yeah, and we know where this belongs

1451
01:40:06.12 --> 01:40:09.40
Yeah, it's so they're kind of right. They're right either way. They're right

1452
01:40:09.64 --> 01:40:13.000
It'd be nice if they could give the consumer the visibility

1453
01:40:13.48 --> 01:40:16.60
On like, oh, I have a healthy option that I can go to here. Yeah

1454
01:40:16.60 --> 01:40:21.48
Well, I guess it kind of depends right? Well, ideally both but you know, then logistically, right?

1455
01:40:21.96 --> 01:40:23.96
I'm kind of kind of but

1456
01:40:23.96 --> 01:40:29.64
Yes, look if I go in I don't know. I don't know about the goes yet. I go in. I just want an energy drink

1457
01:40:29.72 --> 01:40:34.92
You know, I want the sugar free. I'm just gonna go, you know, I go and then I see the new go sugar free all the good stuff

1458
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.60
It's good for you. It's like brah. I'm choosing now and all day all day energy drink

1459
01:40:39.80 --> 01:40:43.80
But at the same time if I'm like brah, I'm I'm not down for energy drinks

1460
01:40:43.80 --> 01:40:46.52
I'm down for the healthy one healthy stuff the kombucha

1461
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:49.08
Or whatever. I don't know what the hell

1462
01:40:49.24 --> 01:40:52.84
Other healthy things but anyway, and then they're gonna see that boom. They're gonna grab that one as well

1463
01:40:52.92 --> 01:40:54.92
See what I'm saying? So they got to be there

1464
01:40:54.92 --> 01:40:58.04
So yeah, the hard thing is is like you get into this business

1465
01:40:59.48 --> 01:41:03.08
That's all that shelf space is like accounted for it means something

1466
01:41:03.08 --> 01:41:08.68
It's like every little slot that they have in any of these stores has value. There's a value at slot

1467
01:41:08.68 --> 01:41:10.52
So they're like, hey look, uh

1468
01:41:10.52 --> 01:41:15.08
We can't put you in both the way you want the whole so you want this to be what why don't we put it in the meat section too?

1469
01:41:16.28 --> 01:41:18.28
You know

1470
01:41:18.92 --> 01:41:22.28
Yeah, it's yeah, it's so it should be the produce section. Yeah kind of

1471
01:41:23.96 --> 01:41:26.28
So I'm looking for orange juice, right?

1472
01:41:28.04 --> 01:41:33.32
But the stuff, uh, what we got the freshly squeezed. That's what I'm looking for if you go in the juice section

1473
01:41:33.32 --> 01:41:35.32
The ones with the paul

1474
01:41:35.32 --> 01:41:37.32
I don't my wife does I don't

1475
01:41:37.32 --> 01:41:43.000
But you go in the juice section. There's three juice sections by the way in the supermarket. Huh? Yeah, you don't know that because you don't

1476
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:46.12
Want to smell but so you go in the juice section with a grit?

1477
01:41:46.84 --> 01:41:50.92
Like in the refrigerator ish section. So there's your what do you call?

1478
01:41:51.56 --> 01:41:59.000
I forget the brands offhand, but welches. There's some welches in there. Tropicana. Tropicana. Yes. Simply orange

Or you can go to the cranberry juice the cran grape the cram crann apple

1481
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:12.60
The lemon juice that's in a hole. That's in the aisle. It's a different section

1482
01:42:13.32 --> 01:42:15.32
And then if you want the freshly squeezed

1483
01:42:15.64 --> 01:42:21.88
Oh, you're open like the organic area. Yeah, like night. It's like in the fruit and vegetable section kind of it's weird, right?

1484
01:42:22.04 --> 01:42:26.84
So it's like it's kind of one of those things you kind of got to know what you're there for and know who you're providing for at the same time

1485
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:31.48

Rookie mistake. Yeah for a computer guy. Yeah brutal. It can happen to anybody. I guess even the strongest have their moments of fatigue
