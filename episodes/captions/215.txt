[00:00:00] This is Jacob podcast number 215 with echo Charles and me,
[00:00:05] Jacob willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.
[00:00:08] I got a little quote, kick things off today.
[00:00:12] The general who does not advance to seek glory or does not withdraw to avoid punishment,
[00:00:20] but cares for only the people's security and promotes the people's interests
[00:00:28] is the nation's treasure. That's a little son Sue coming at you.
[00:00:33] And of course, we covered son Sue on podcast number 23.
[00:00:39] And it's just always interesting how you can find the same themes
[00:00:47] throughout time from a leadership perspective.
[00:00:49] I know I talk about this point a lot in leadership strategy and tactics book.
[00:00:55] This statement right here, this is 2500 years old.
[00:00:59] And he's saying the same thing that I say in leadership strategy and tactics
[00:01:05] that many of the problems that come about for a leader are from.
[00:01:12] There you go. And so we have to learn to keep our ego in check. Now this is,
[00:01:18] you know, we talk about it in extreme ownership, the very first book.
[00:01:22] This isn't like, hey, I just thought of this yesterday. And it's not like I just thought of this
[00:01:26] anyway. Like I said, somebody was jumping on somebody was making some comments on social media,
[00:01:36] platform that he said, he's acting like me. I'm acting like I invented covered move.
[00:01:46] I said, hey, no, it's actually, I say all the time, I didn't invent this or much of anything.
[00:01:50] So I didn't invent this idea of ego. I didn't just think of it, whatever.
[00:01:59] But it is a theme that we see over and over again from people that pay attention.
[00:02:06] Not just from a leadership perspective either. I mean, no more talking life problems.
[00:02:10] So this was interesting. So we just wrapped up the juggle live tour. It was awesome. Thanks for
[00:02:14] the game. I got some really good questions along the way. And a lot of times,
[00:02:21] the questions, sometimes the questions are about ego, even though the person doesn't even know
[00:02:26] that the questions about ego, but when you start to dig in, you start to realize that it's about ego.
[00:02:30] But the, so this first question is one of those questions. And the question was something
[00:02:39] along the lines of this. It was something like, what should I do if a peer of mine is working hard,
[00:02:46] putting an extra effort and trying to shine so that they get promoted? That was the question.
[00:02:55] And that's a good question, right? Because right, what do you do? And the instinct is,
[00:03:01] like you know what I'm saying? You can even feel that instinct. I could see it and look
[00:03:04] on your face right now. Yes. You have the look on your face of like, you can see that that's a
[00:03:08] little bit offensive, right? When you go, oh, this person's trying to, or,
[00:03:13] or trying to put that extra effort and trying to shine so that they can get promoted.
[00:03:19] Right. No one likes that person, by the way. Right. No one likes the brown noiser. So we get it.
[00:03:27] So then the question was, what should this person do? What? You know, let's
[00:03:29] to guy ask me, what do I do when that's happening? And the instinct, which is the instinct you
[00:03:34] had, which is the instinct, my first instinct, even me, Mr. Keep your ego in check.
[00:03:42] My very first instinct is like a little bit of like a pushback, like, oh, it's that guy. And I want
[00:03:46] to lash out out, right? But that's not the right answer. You know, because, well, that's what you say,
[00:03:54] you say, oh, they think they are. Yeah. Look at what they're doing. So, you know what that is? That's
[00:04:00] making those attacks that's your own person legal. That's my own ego. My own ego going,
[00:04:05] with that person just wants to get promoted. So, if you can take a second, you can take a step back,
[00:04:13] you can detach, you can put your ego in check. And if you do that, then you say to yourself, okay,
[00:04:21] here's what's, here's the situation. If we remove the ego, here's the situation. This person
[00:04:25] is working extra hard. By the way, this person's appears. So, we're on the same team. This person
[00:04:31] is working extra hard. They're putting in extra effort. They are trying to shine. And all those things,
[00:04:38] all those things are actually good for your team. Right? I got someone that's trying to do a
[00:04:49] great job that's working harder. I'm actually happy. I'm actually happy. If there's a person,
[00:04:55] working harder, I'm actually, that's good. If there's a person that's trying to outwork me and
[00:04:59] do a better job than me, that's actually awesome. Because now we're going to be a better team.
[00:05:07] Now, mind you, any moment you let your ego slip into this, it turns into a nightmare. It's not
[00:05:13] good. You don't like it. You're offended. That's someone's trying to work harder than you.
[00:05:19] But if you keep your ego in check, then that's good. You realize that it's good. And I'll tell you
[00:05:25] something else in this way. What I answered this question. I said, for this person,
[00:05:32] to outwork me, he's going to have a hard time outwork me because I'm here to win too.
[00:05:41] And that is a little bit of my ego. But that, that ego is being a positive thing. Because I'm,
[00:05:46] oh, you're going to step up your game. Guess what I'm going to do? Step up my game. I'm not going
[00:05:49] to undermine you. That would be negative. That would be my ego causing problem. But if I go,
[00:05:53] oh, your, echo is stepping up his game. Echo showing up at at six o'clock in the morning,
[00:05:57] instead of in set of six ten. Oh, and I'm, and I'm coming in at six. Oh, five. Guess what?
[00:06:01] Guess what? I'm going to come in in tomorrow. No, for 30. But you're right. So I do, I do a little bit more.
[00:06:09] So now, now we're both a little bit more prepared. Now we got some good competitive
[00:06:12] and this going on. That's good. It's good for the team. So you, this other person, this other
[00:06:21] person that's stepping up the game, trying to do a good job is actually awesome.
[00:06:27] Because it's going to make me step up my game. And I'm going to tell you right now, that person
[00:06:30] is going to have a hard time outworking me. They're going to have a hard time bringing it.
[00:06:34] I'm actually fired up. I'm actually getting fired up right now. Like, I'm getting,
[00:06:38] I'm, I'm starting to like, I'm thinking I might attack you right now just to see what's up.
[00:06:44] You go. So that's good. Now here's, here's where the second
[00:06:47] ego scenario that you have to get under control. What if that person steps up their game?
[00:06:54] I step up my game. They end up they actually do end up outshining me. They actually do end up
[00:07:00] getting the big promotion. Then what do I do? Do I get bitter? Do I get jealous? Do I get mad?
[00:07:09] Do I now start to undermine them and spread rumors about now? Actually, if somebody, if somebody
[00:07:18] outworked me and outperformed me and then got promoted, good for them, that is awesome. Credit.
[00:07:28] They get a credit. You're done good, son. You're done good. And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:07:34] And what I am going to do is instead of being bitter and mad and jealous.
[00:07:38] And all those things, instead of actually going to put my ego out of the picture and say what
[00:07:43] actually happened, where did this person perform better than me? And how can I support them?
[00:07:48] How can I learn some lessons from this and how can I become better? So the next time
[00:07:52] there is an opportunity, I do get promoted. You wouldn't think that that question is about
[00:08:00] your own personal ego. From the beginning. Now it's easy to see. Looking back.
[00:08:03] Yeah. But from the beginning, it's like, hey, what do you do? How do you handle this situation?
[00:08:06] When someone's trying to outwork you and outshine you and they're trying to get promoted?
[00:08:09] Yeah. That sounds like an interpersonal relationship question. It's not. It's a question about ego.
[00:08:17] Which is, which is something we always need to pay attention to. So as I was thinking again,
[00:08:24] once again, Jockel live was kind of like, you went to two Jockel lives. Is that correct?
[00:08:30] Yes. They weren't really a podcast. They weren't really a Q&A. They weren't really just sort of
[00:08:36] a, they were a little bit of everything, right? A little bit of stories, a little bit of lessons,
[00:08:44] a little bit of, yeah, a little bit of everything. So I did get some questions, though.
[00:08:50] That first one was one of those general questions. And now, as I started thinking about the
[00:08:54] questions and how a lot of them related to ego, another question that I got that was actually
[00:09:02] another important question. The question was again, something along the lines of, and I'm
[00:09:07] sure we can go back and, and pulled it recording. But here's the other thing. Is some of these
[00:09:14] questions that I got asked? I got asked like the same similar questions. So I'm paraphrasing
[00:09:18] what this other question was. But this one, the question was something along the lines of,
[00:09:25] hey, listen, Jockel. I know that keeping the ego in check is important. Principal, I read about
[00:09:32] an extreme ownership. You talk about it all the time. Got to be humble. But at my company,
[00:09:36] ego is a huge problem. How do I get my company to start promoting the ideal of humility?
[00:09:44] And how do I get them to recognize that ego is such a big problem? Now, this is a really good
[00:09:50] question. Once again, because you can imagine what this individual is, right? Like, you know,
[00:09:56] you're at a company where there's a lot of ego's going on. And all of a sudden, you have a little
[00:10:00] moment of enlightenment. You realize that ego is causing you a lot of problems. So you start putting
[00:10:06] your own ego in check. Have any of you go, wow, this is working. I'm doing better. I'm coordinating
[00:10:10] better. I'm working in my interpersonal relationships with other people on the team are better.
[00:10:15] My relationships with people on other teams are better. We're getting more done because our
[00:10:18] relationships are better. I'm putting the team in the mission above myself. That means the
[00:10:22] team in the mission are doing better. That's great. So you realize all this stuff. And then you say,
[00:10:28] okay, well, how do I start to spread the word? How do I get other people to do this? And this is a
[00:10:34] tricky question, right? It's a tricky thing because if some, if like, let's say your team has,
[00:10:41] you see that ego is a problem and you sit them down and go, listen guys, you're all, you're all
[00:10:47] got big ego's and that's the problem. I mean, you're going to run into level nine defensiveness.
[00:10:53] You're actually going, it's actually going to be on defensiveness. They're going to start attacking you.
[00:10:57] That's what's going to happen. You got all these crazy ego's. They're going to gang up. They're like,
[00:11:01] unite. You know, put their ego aside for a split second. That can unite against you.
[00:11:07] So you can't confront them. And once again, are there certain relationships that you could have
[00:11:15] with someone where I go, let's say you and me and you had to be ego. But you and I were really
[00:11:19] tightness at hey man, you're letting your ego get in the way of this. Sure, that kid that that is
[00:11:23] a possibility. That is a very rare occurrence. Most of the people that you work with on regular basis,
[00:11:30] you don't have that type of a relationship. The other thing is when someone has a big ego,
[00:11:35] that's not the type of person that's open to those kind of criticisms anyways. So it's like there's
[00:11:40] two hurdles that you have to overcome. Number one, your relationship isn't usually that good.
[00:11:45] Number two, they have a big ego, which is part of the problem. And that's what makes the problem hard
[00:11:49] to attack. So what are you going to do? That and I got to throw this one more little thing
[00:11:59] when people talk about the, you know, I have someone say, put, wouldn't it be better if you
[00:12:06] could just talk to? Wouldn't it be better if you just, you know, put down some bulletized
[00:12:12] list and said, hey, here's the things that your ego, there's the problems that your goes from
[00:12:16] causing. Look, I get it. And isn't it great to have direct conversations? Isn't it great if I
[00:12:21] can just sit you down if echo, if you and I have this mind melt where you just know 100% looking
[00:12:28] out for you and you're open to create. Like if we have that, that's in an ideal world, that's great.
[00:12:34] That's great. Golfclap. It's great. The problem is it doesn't exist very often. And
[00:12:41] confronting someone that has an ego about the ego can often just exacerbate the problem.
[00:12:48] So here's what you do. Instead of self-identifying the problem and pointing the fingers at other
[00:12:58] people, which by the way is placing blame, which is a problem. So instead of doing that,
[00:13:06] what we're going to do is start pulling the thread on some of the problems that we're having
[00:13:11] on the team. So for instance, this group over here needs some help on their part of the project,
[00:13:22] but no one's helping them. What's going on? If you start to pull the thread on that, you'll find
[00:13:29] at the end of that thread, they'll be hanging some egos. Whether it's the ego of the person that
[00:13:35] doesn't want to ask help, or whether it's the ego of the other person that doesn't want to give
[00:13:39] help because they think they need to do their own job. I'm not doing that. So you pull the thread
[00:13:46] and at the end you'll find these little egos hanging and then what you do is you just expose.
[00:13:50] And you say, what do you think the root of the problem is? You start pulling that thread and you get
[00:13:54] to a point where someone says, you can finally have an open conversation. Where you say, where someone
[00:13:59] finally says, we know I guess I guess I could use some help. You just discovered it. So that's like a
[00:14:08] covering move situation, right? If a covering move isn't happening and it isn't happening because
[00:14:13] of egos, if you pull the thread, you'll get to the end of the thread and it will be attached to
[00:14:18] someone ego in most cases. Is there a possibility that it's like, hey, this group doesn't know
[00:14:22] what the other groups don't? Yeah, absolutely. Those are, but those are easy problems to solve.
[00:14:26] Because we can just pull the thread, we find at the end, oh, we need to, we need better coordination
[00:14:30] between these two teams. Cool. There it is. When you pull the thread, it comes out the little
[00:14:34] egos dangling on the end of it. Then you go, okay, let's expose these and let's try and ask
[00:14:40] questions to figure out and get people to realize what they're looking at. You want them to come to
[00:14:48] that conclusion. That's the trick. That's the maneuver. Is to get them to come to conclusion and
[00:14:54] they might never verbalize it, but they go, yeah, in their mind, they're like, I guess I didn't want
[00:14:59] to ask for help because my ego isn't the way. So there's one, you know, if you got people that
[00:15:07] are taking on or keeping things simple, just go through the laws combat, simple, make people
[00:15:12] making the plans to complex and yet they keep doing it. And when you go and say, you know,
[00:15:19] these plans seem like they're really complex. And of course, they say something like, hey,
[00:15:25] I don't think everyone understood the plan. It seems to seem kind of complex. And a person says,
[00:15:32] people need to pay more attention when I'm briefing. And you pull on that, right? The front line
[00:15:40] troops, they need more detail because they go, otherwise they're going to screw up. That's why
[00:15:44] it's so complex. It's like, okay, let's look at what's really happening. What's really happening
[00:15:50] is I've created a plan that I won't give up because my ego is too big. Right? When you pull that
[00:15:58] thread and you go, listen to the front line troops, don't understand what to do. It seems like
[00:16:03] that could be a real problem. And maybe, and this is nothing you give them a little out. You give
[00:16:11] them a little out. Maybe we just need to back it off a little bit so that they can understand
[00:16:16] it, maybe they're not as smart as you. You go, listen, you go, listen, you know what? Fine,
[00:16:21] I'll simplify it. Boom. And in the meantime, you've given them a little indication, look,
[00:16:26] if you confront them, that's what I'm saying. It's hard for people to want to play the long game here.
[00:16:30] Because the short game is that you think you're so smart, you're playing to do complex and you're
[00:16:35] sticking with them because you got a big ego. How's that going to work out? It's not going to
[00:16:39] work out good. Can it work out 4% of the time? Yes. The other, the other, the other,
[00:16:46] 96% of the time, you get a defensive person that's now accusing other people. It's
[00:16:54] take the indirect and play the long game. Take the indirect attack and play the long game.
[00:16:57] Prioritize next Q. Why is that failing? Because again, this question is Ego's a problem.
[00:17:04] So where does Ego manifest as a problem? It can manifest as a problem in
[00:17:08] prioritized next Q. Because if someone's got a big ego and they're not getting things done,
[00:17:14] they go, I can get it done. Because their ego thinks they can do anything, right?
[00:17:17] Or prioritize Q. Ego can be a problem. If you have a project and I have a project and you need help
[00:17:28] and your project is actually more important. I should give you resources, but instead of
[00:17:31] like my initiative, just as important as Ego's is. Which is just my ego. I should look at it and
[00:17:36] say, okay, you know what, you should be the priority. And another good one is, well, it's just what
[00:17:42] I just said, but I'm not going to give up. Why should I have to give my resources to Ego? Those are mine.
[00:17:49] Those are mine. No, actually, what's the biggest priority? Okay, put my ego aside. Ego's
[00:17:56] priority is actually bigger than mine. I'm going to give him four of my people so that he can get the job done.
[00:18:05] So when you pull the front on this and you say, well, hey, why is it Jocca? Why is it? You don't
[00:18:09] want to give people to Ego? And I'm like, well, you know, what if something else comes up?
[00:18:16] Well, something else comes up. You can get back. Well, you know, they got to learn to respect the
[00:18:21] chain of command. Well, there's still work for you. They'll just be loaned over to Ego. Well,
[00:18:26] you should understand? It's just ego, ego, ego, ego. So these are the kind of problems that
[00:18:30] manifests themselves inside of a company wrapped around ego. And decentralized command, you can have
[00:18:36] the same thing happen with decentralized command. How does ego cause a problem with decentralized
[00:18:41] command? It's like this. Hey, I noticed that you know, you seem to be making all the decisions
[00:18:47] and the folks out in the field don't really have the opportunity to kind of make calls.
[00:18:52] Why is that on the only one that has the experience to do this?
[00:18:57] They don't have the skill that I have. Right. So there's all these reasons that that's one of those
[00:19:04] are ego problems. Right. And by the way, if it's not an ego problem, then I say, oh, you know what?
[00:19:11] Cause I haven't really trained the guys well enough. And I'm going to, you know what, you're right.
[00:19:15] I've been making way too many detailed decisions for the guys out in the field. I need to get down
[00:19:19] there and make sure they know what's going on, train them better so that I can back off. Cool.
[00:19:22] That's the person that's got the ego in check. The person that's like, I'm the only one that can
[00:19:26] do this. Like, no, you can't get no, you're not. And if you are, you're wrong.
[00:19:32] Because right now, you've got three people working for you. What happens when you have eight?
[00:19:36] You're going to go around the field in all these different locations to make every single
[00:19:40] decision. No, you can't. So get your ego under control. Realize that you're not the only one
[00:19:46] that can do this job and train your people properly. Again, that's a direct assault. Probably
[00:19:52] going to cause problems. Instead, if we just pull the thread on it, hey, what's going on?
[00:19:57] It seems like you're, it's folks in the field don't have a lot of authority. Well, you know
[00:20:00] that experience. Oh, okay. It's kind of cumbersome though. Like, then reaching back to you all the time
[00:20:06] to make these decisions. It is, but you know, I'm the one that really knows how to do it.
[00:20:11] I mean, what happens if, you know, if you're sick or, you know, someone's got to, you know,
[00:20:16] have communications with them. Do you think it would be a good idea? You know, since you
[00:20:24] have so much knowledge of experience to maybe pass that onto some of the other people?
[00:20:27] Oh, yeah. Okay, cool. Let's make that happen. And then obviously, ego can absolutely
[00:20:37] manifest itself when it comes to taking ownership. I mean, all day long, right? What, oh,
[00:20:46] that project failed. What happened? My support. It's don't know. Don't want to step up.
[00:20:50] Oh, because it's their fault. Why, why are your support in it's taking ownership?
[00:20:58] Because they don't even know what ownership is. They don't want to take ownership. Okay.
[00:21:03] So it's not your fault. No. Okay. Well, what can we do to help them?
[00:21:10] Pull the string and you add the bottom. The person will see. It's the ego. They might not admit it,
[00:21:16] but they'll see it. And then they can start to make adjustments. Now, look, can any of these situations
[00:21:25] escalate in a point where indirect indirect indirect doesn't work? And eventually you say,
[00:21:30] you know what? I got a, I got to sit echoed down and say, listen, here's what I think is the
[00:21:36] root of the problem. The root of the problem is you think you're the only one that knows how to do this.
[00:21:42] And in thinking that you're not training anybody like I might have to get that direct. It does
[00:21:46] happen. We prefer to use the minimum force required when it comes to leadership, just like being a
[00:21:53] balancer. Yes, sir. Right? It's not hey, the guys a little out of line, hate him in the head with a black
[00:21:59] jack. No, it's like, hey, you're, hey, sir. You know, I think you've had enough for tonight.
[00:22:03] Can you come with me? That's minimum force required. If the guy says, okay, cool. It's problem solved.
[00:22:09] If he's, if he says, you're a muck going anywhere. Okay. Well, we have to escalate. It's the same thing
[00:22:13] here, but don't start with the direct attack. Just like you don't club the person out of the gate.
[00:22:19] I think it's a slap jack. I'm not sure. Okay. That's what you're talking about. That
[00:22:24] little as they're thing. Yeah, a black jack. Yeah, black. Yeah. Right? It's a black. Did you guys
[00:22:30] not use those? That's a think those are illegal. That's illegal. Yeah, the slap jack. Yeah. One guy had
[00:22:38] one. Yeah. But yeah, they're illegal. So we don't want to escalate straight to the black jack.
[00:22:47] Or even a slap jack. Even a slap jack. If anyone's using a slap jack. I think it's called a slap
[00:22:52] jack. Okay. I'm not sure. Point remains. I dig it fairly confident you're wrong, but not 100%.
[00:23:01] Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, you know, when someone, you know, when you're pretty confident about
[00:23:05] something that somebody just throws a little randomness into the soup and it makes you question yourself.
[00:23:08] Yeah. That's how I feel right now. Yeah. That's kind of real confident with a little bit of questions.
[00:23:14] It makes you feel any better. That's my everyday life. So that's the answer to this question.
[00:23:21] Is really pulling the thread on the problem to reveal the root of the problem, which you're
[00:23:27] going to see as ego. And then it's there for the people. Hopefully to see it to recognize it,
[00:23:35] to possibly admit it. Maybe not give them an out where they can actually make a adjustment without
[00:23:41] taking the ownership of the ego because that's okay. We're trying to win, right? We're trying
[00:23:44] to let the team win. We're not trying to, we're not, what my goal is not to make you admit it.
[00:23:50] Because you know what that is? That's my ego. No, yeah. Let's show it. Yeah. It's got a big ego.
[00:23:56] Get them to get them to admit it. That's not what my goal is. My goal is to make you make
[00:24:00] better decisions as a leader so that we win as a team. Yeah. So that's what we're trying to do here.
[00:24:11] It's really interesting that how you laid that out because you used to do that to me. Uh oh.
[00:24:18] Probably still do. Maybe. But it was less about the ego I think anyway. Maybe it's all the same.
[00:24:22] Maybe at the end of the day it's all the same. It's possible. Because skating or trying to
[00:24:27] dance or writing or explaining to me how I would do this to you. You do with excuses. Okay. So like
[00:24:31] if something didn't get done or can't get done or I think it's too hard and really most of the time
[00:24:36] if I'm remembering correctly it was at the end of the day this is what it was. It was like,
[00:24:41] I'm too lazy for whatever. You know, so it always be like this excuse like, well you know that's
[00:24:47] to the answer. That's that. And then you'd have all these just like how you're saying and it made
[00:24:51] me remember this because you're tone how you're like kind of saying those little answers there.
[00:24:56] Ah, that's the same to me. Like, we're all simple. Just like, well just here. Here's the solution
[00:25:00] to that problem right here. Because there's all these little excuses that you make. You know like,
[00:25:04] oh, I didn't really have time because I had to do this and you'd be like, okay, then you just do this.
[00:25:08] You know, and that'll solve that particular problem. You didn't have this big comprehensive plan to
[00:25:13] solve in my life problem. You're like, okay, for every excuse I would make, you just have the little
[00:25:18] solve, you know, the problem or the solution to it. And I'd be like, man, and meanwhile you're
[00:25:24] getting back into this corner or the string is just getting pulled like, with every pull you start
[00:25:29] to sense or stop it. In your case, it was lazy. Oh yeah, like I just was too lazy or I'm just like stuck
[00:25:36] in this routine or whatever. And then it's so it could in a way be like, okay, that's just my
[00:25:41] ego just thinking that the way that's not the way I do things kind of thing. And think if I were to
[00:25:46] use the different tone, think if I would have just said, that's could you're lazy. Oh yeah,
[00:25:52] yeah, you just being lazy, echo. You'd have been like, you even know what it takes to make one of these
[00:25:56] things. Oh, you know what I mean? Yeah. And then all of a sudden we, and what does that do to our
[00:25:59] relationship? Yeah. And what does that do to to do that final product? Yeah. Right now you're doing
[00:26:06] something against your will. Oh, yeah. Oh, just staying a little bit. Staying on it. Yeah,
[00:26:12] fully. And yeah, if you would have just been like, hey, you're lazy, this is what my mind would have
[00:26:16] went to this belief. This actually, and in a way, it's true, but it doesn't like get anyone anywhere,
[00:26:22] where if you would be like, you're lazy, I would have thought and maybe even said that it's not
[00:26:26] that I'm lazy. It's just you're just this crazy hard worker who have these standards that are
[00:26:30] unreasonable for a normal person. And I'm just a normal person, excuse me, you know, kind of an attitude.
[00:26:35] That's what I would go to rather than if you like the way how you always do it is like you pull
[00:26:41] the string or you just sort of, you know what's interesting too is when I'm doing that,
[00:26:47] I'm not doing that like, okay, I got the, here's my next move on echo. Yeah. Actually what I'm doing
[00:26:52] is like, whoa, you know, you say, well, we can't, I can't make a video because it's going to take
[00:26:58] me too long to get through the raw edits. And I go, you know, I'll say like, well, you know,
[00:27:03] if you want, just get, you know, hire someone to do those raw edits for you. Right.
[00:27:08] And would that work? Yeah. You know what I mean? I mean, I'll ask you a legitimate question. Oh,
[00:27:12] yeah. Maybe I kind of know the answer. I mean, I suspect I know the answer, but it's not,
[00:27:16] it's not just, hey, I'm setting you up. I'm legitimately pulling the thread. And the answer might
[00:27:24] be it is impossible to get this project done. But when I say, well, you could hire someone to do
[00:27:29] those raw edits. And then you go, okay, well, even if I hire someone, how am I going to transfer
[00:27:37] all this data? And I go, well, if you want, what couldn't you get an external hard drive and just
[00:27:44] physically give it to him? And you'd say, well, these are actual situations. No, I don't know.
[00:27:50] I just, I don't know the realm of video well enough to go down those roads. The main, the one that
[00:27:58] I remember the easiest is like with training. Like, it'll be, hey, we're training at 430,
[00:28:04] but I train during the day, almost, oh, not in the evening. Then you'll be like, oh, yeah,
[00:28:08] training at 430, I'm like, well, you know, and I have all these reasons. And then you're like,
[00:28:12] you kind of just chip away at all these reasons. Like, oh, here's the solution to that. Here's
[00:28:16] the solution to that. Here's the solution. It's like, man, I just, I just, like, my routine. I just
[00:28:21] got to admit it, you know, like, all right. But I don't get to train with you guys this often,
[00:28:25] you know, kind of thing. But it's like, yeah, you expose, you pull the string to expose just,
[00:28:30] like the little, the little excuses. Sure. So, pull the thread, reveal the problem. Don't
[00:28:38] confront if you can help it. And people will start to recognize what the problem is. I mean,
[00:28:45] this is assuming you're working with this, well, there's one problem with this. And that is,
[00:28:51] if the person has a giant ego, this is the hardest thing for them to admit, right? So they might not
[00:28:58] admit it. But they'll see it. They'll behave differently. And by the way, one of the good ways to
[00:29:04] to use someone's ego against themselves is when you say something along the lines of, you know,
[00:29:13] man, it's going to look good if this gets done right. You know what I'm saying? And they think,
[00:29:17] oh, cool. I'm going to do this. I'm going to make this adjustment just so it gets done, just so
[00:29:22] my ego can get just so I can win. Yeah, that doesn't say that. Use the word win. Because every time
[00:29:28] like, use the word win. And anytime, what I'd be thinking, like, okay, if I didn't win, what's left,
[00:29:38] you lost? Yeah. No matter what excuse you make you lost. So if you put shed light on, like, use that
[00:29:44] word and be like, hey, this will make you win. And you're like, hell, yeah. But at the same time,
[00:29:49] the back of my mind, like, basically, if we don't solve these problems or whatever, I lose,
[00:29:52] I don't want that. So it's like, extra motivated. It's the winning at all costs thing. And so the
[00:29:58] winning at all costs, I wrote like a little section. And it was a part of a one of the special releases
[00:30:03] on Barnes and Noble's version of that caught a minute of leadership was this thing, winning at all costs.
[00:30:09] And it's, and then someone posted, and I had, I had said it before, right? And someone posted a
[00:30:15] clip of me saying this idea of winning at all costs. And it's the way that I talk about it.
[00:30:22] It's kind of a trick anyways, because I go through this thing about what is leadership and
[00:30:26] a leadership is this leadership that, and then I said, what leadership is to me is winning at all costs.
[00:30:30] And somebody put, I'm probably you put a clip up of me saying that. And somebody said,
[00:30:38] of course, someone's like, that's the kind of person that will run people over in a bubble
[00:30:42] or more. Like, like, gave it negative things, right? But what they don't realize is what the
[00:30:46] rest of that clip says. And what the rest of that whole idea of winning at all costs is what
[00:30:52] I'll do to win at all costs is totally subordinate. My ego help other people support them,
[00:30:57] give them what they need and put my put, put the team and the mission above myself, because
[00:31:04] the, that's how I'm going to win at all costs. So winning at all costs doesn't mean I'm stepping
[00:31:07] on other people. I mean, it's actually lifting other people up. That's what it means. So if you can
[00:31:12] use that, you know, if I say, hey, I go, man, look, we need to win. And if we're going to win,
[00:31:20] the only way to win is if you can learn how to work with Jim, otherwise we lose. And you're
[00:31:24] like, you know what? Because I'm a winner all work with Jim. And cool, it's a first step.
[00:31:29] Yeah. Yeah. And this was kind of related to a question that we haven't done a Q&A in a
[00:31:38] long time. And this is kind of a partial Q&A. Sure. I don't know. It's just some topics.
[00:31:43] But anyways, we got one of these questions hit it. Yes, Jocco, what do you tell someone who has
[00:31:51] been passed over for a military promotion? They deserved. Could you address this?
[00:31:56] Yeah. So part of it is what we just talked about. What do you do when you get passed over? Cool.
[00:32:03] Why did so? And it's also covered in, I think there's a, well, I know, there's a literal chapter
[00:32:08] inside leadership strategy and tactics, which is what to do when you're, when you don't get promoted.
[00:32:15] That's that's the actual name of the chapter. When you're not chosen, page 160, boom, there it is.
[00:32:22] When you are not chosen, and we covered it on the podcast. So what you do is you go and you say,
[00:32:30] boss, I know there's opportunities to get promoted. I know I didn't get promoted. I know there
[00:32:34] must be some shortfalls that I have. Can you help me indicate what those shortfalls are? Cool.
[00:32:40] So that's, and I'll just give a factual. There's the officer commissioning program that I got picked
[00:32:47] up for. It was called the Seaman 2 Admiral program. It was a highly selective program. They took
[00:32:55] 50 sailors from the entire Navy. And there's, I don't know, 250,000 something people say was in the
[00:33:01] Navy. They took 50. And the first year that I put in for it, I did not get selected. I got actually
[00:33:09] I got selected as an alternate, which was as they say, almost worse. Yeah, let's see it.
[00:33:15] Because you don't, you don't, you get nothing. You get the smell it. Yeah, you get the smell it. You
[00:33:21] don't get the touch. You don't get to taste it. So it was not good. Well, it was good. Because I was like,
[00:33:26] okay, I'm close. But, but I didn't get it. I didn't get it. And what did I do?
[00:33:33] Assessed. And said, what can I do better? And work harder. And the next year, I got it. So if you
[00:33:40] don't get promoted, because you deserved it, maybe you didn't deserve it. And if you did deserve it,
[00:33:47] you'll get it next time. And instead of saying you deserved it, why not look at it and say,
[00:33:52] okay, what did I not do to make myself the best absolute best candidate that they could not
[00:33:58] question needed to get this promotion? Instead, we're saying I deserved it. Someone else got,
[00:34:02] what is that doing? Blaming the boss blade in the selection process, blaming all these other
[00:34:08] things that you cannot control. But if you take ownership of it and say, you know what?
[00:34:12] Okay, I didn't get promoted. There must be some things that I can do better.
[00:34:17] There's the answer. Own it. Ask, give me some feedback, please. What do I need to make this happen?
[00:34:25] And then implement. Now, this, this, there was this other topic that I kind of wanted to
[00:34:35] bring up. That was from, once again, it was from Jockel Live. And there was a young woman.
[00:34:45] And again, this, this goes to the kind of variety of different people that were coming to the
[00:34:51] Jockel Lives were all over the place. So this, this young woman asked a question that was kind of like,
[00:34:58] how do you, and I can't, when you're at the live events, there's light shining in your eyes.
[00:35:03] So you're not really 100% sure. You don't get it. It's not like that, you're not seeing the
[00:35:07] person face to face. So I'm kind of looking out into the light. I'm seeing this frame of a young woman.
[00:35:12] And she asked something along the lines of, you know, how do you handle when there's people
[00:35:17] that are trying to pull you down and, and, and, you know, pick you apart.
[00:35:23] And I said, well, what do you do? And she's like, I'm in school. And I said, what school?
[00:35:34] And she said, high school. And I said, what grade? And she said, I'm a freshman.
[00:35:40] And I said, okay, so you're getting bullied. But because essentially, that's what that's what you
[00:35:44] was saying, right? I'm getting picked on. I got people trying to drag me down. What you know what that's
[00:35:48] called, that's called bullying. I said, so you're getting bullied. And she said, yes, getting bullied.
[00:35:56] So I said, I said, you know, I thought about it for a second. I said, well, I've got some
[00:36:06] bad news. And I've got some good news. And I'm going to start with the bad news. The bad news is that
[00:36:14] people can be mean. And they can be mean for a variety of reasons. They can be mean
[00:36:27] because they're insecure. They can be mean because they're bullied themselves. They can be mean
[00:36:31] because they're unhappy. They can be mean because they're scared to be vulnerable. So they put up that front.
[00:36:37] But they might be suffering and jealous and have no self-esteem. It's the way some people are.
[00:36:47] And there's some people that are just evil that get joy out of putting other people down. So there's
[00:36:51] all those kind of people exist. And they especially exist inside of immature people in high school.
[00:37:02] So that's the bad news. And then I said, but the good news is high school is not life.
[00:37:17] And when I said that, it was actually funny when I said that people started clapping because
[00:37:22] everyone in that room knew that it was true. And that reminded me of another
[00:37:28] conversation that I've been having with people lately about
[00:37:38] about ecosystems, something I've called ecosystems. So little ecosystems in the world that people
[00:37:46] get caught up in. And they get caught trying to get to the top hierarchy of some little ecosystem
[00:37:56] somewhere. And look, I get it. Jordan Peterson, we're trying to ascend the top of our
[00:38:07] dominance hierarchy. Be the best you can. I totally get that. Absolutely. But there can be a problem
[00:38:17] with this. From multiple angles. The world is filled with these little ecosystems. And high school is
[00:38:26] one of them. Remember the little high school ecosystem. There's someone that's popular. There's all
[00:38:31] these little eat. There's this ecosystem there. And high school, this is something. You look at
[00:38:38] high school kid and you try and explain to them that once you left high school, no one really cares.
[00:38:42] Right. Correct. If you care about it, deeply, you're actually on Carico. Right? If you're the one
[00:38:52] that's running around saying, when I was in high school this, when I was in high school that,
[00:38:56] but here's the problem. And this is one of the reasons when I wrote, way the warrior kid,
[00:38:59] the first one. One of the things that triggered me to write it was, you know, here I was at work,
[00:39:04] war going on, big real legitimate crazy problems and dynasties and dynamics to figure out.
[00:39:13] Things are going on. And I'd come home and like one of my kids would be sad that they got called
[00:39:20] the name or sad that they got a low grade or an attest or whatever. And I would be thinking,
[00:39:28] like I had a moment of clarity where I thought I can't believe they're sad about this, who cares?
[00:39:35] And then I realized, oh yeah, idiot, Jocco. That thing that's going on in their world is their
[00:39:42] whole world. It's the ego. See, it's their entire world is in that one ecosystem. So
[00:39:50] it's hard for people to realize that their ecosystem that they're in is not the whole world.
[00:39:55] It's the same thing when you start getting a college and I've got two kids in college now.
[00:40:00] This whole ecosystem around first getting into college and once you get to college,
[00:40:04] where you're going to get your MBA, where you're doing your internship, this is whole thing.
[00:40:10] And once again, if you step outside that ecosystem into just the normal world,
[00:40:16] no one actually cares about where you got your degree. Not no one, because there's a little
[00:40:22] people inside that ecosystem that they go, where do you get your MBA? Oh, where do you study?
[00:40:27] And there's people that care about that. There's other people that literally do not care at all.
[00:40:32] And I'm incredibly, like from that perspective, I'm incredibly successful business leaders all the time,
[00:40:38] that don't have their MBA and went to some state school in Iowa. I got props the other day
[00:40:44] from someone from Iowa and it said, whenever you think of that state, I'm like, yes, from Iowa,
[00:40:49] some state school and whatever, some little community college in Nebraska and they go out and
[00:40:56] world and dominate. So, but that's not important. We know that that happens.
[00:41:00] Look, and there's people that go to Ivy League schools and they do great too.
[00:41:02] But what I'm saying is they get into this little ecosystem where where what they're actually
[00:41:07] trying to do is climb to the top of that ecosystem only for the sake of climbing to the top of
[00:41:12] that ecosystem, not how it measures into the greater world. Well, kind of card you have.
[00:41:16] There's an ecosystem you can get wrapped up in. You know, I've got my Porsche's better than your Porsche.
[00:41:27] Right? There's people that are into that. And there's other people that I do not care at all at all.
[00:41:41] What about our little ecosystems? We're in it. Right? Would you just do has a little
[00:41:45] little ecosystem? You know what I'm saying? There's a little ecosystem who's who? The podcast world.
[00:41:54] Has an ecosystem. So all these, then those are just things that that you and I are actually
[00:42:00] actively in, right? We do get to and we have a podcast. So we could jump into like where you
[00:42:06] add on the hierarchy of these ecosystems. And again, Jordan, I get it. We're trying to, we're trying to
[00:42:13] go up the hierarchy. I get it. But you have to be able to put that in check. Because why are you doing that?
[00:42:22] What is driving you? If it's, if what's driving you to ascend that hierarchy is because it's going to
[00:42:27] make you better and the people around you better, that's good. If you're doing it for your own
[00:42:31] ego, though, that's a problem. That's where it becomes a problem. The, guess what? The jobs,
[00:42:37] the companies, the industries, they get created. They're sort of the jobs that get created by
[00:42:44] companies and industries. They have their own little ecosystem, right? About I work here, I work there,
[00:42:52] I will. I ran this region like you can see it. It's an ecosystem that exists. The seal teams
[00:42:57] is a freaking ecosystem. And everyone's in there going, you're like, okay, where are you at on the
[00:43:03] ecosystem? Where do we know? How many deployments have you done? Where did you deploy? Do. When
[00:43:07] what schools have you been to? There's a little ecosystem that people are trying to get up and it's
[00:43:11] and I get it. There's some positive to that, right? Because you're trying to do better, trying to work
[00:43:15] harder. That's good. Then there's, there's things, the bar scene. You probably can relate to this
[00:43:21] better than me. There's an ecosystem of the clubs. Yes. And who's the owner and who's the manager
[00:43:29] and who's the GM and who's the head door guy and who comes in here club. Oh, who are you going to
[00:43:36] let in the club? Music scene, real estate. There's this ecosystems everywhere. And so this is the point
[00:43:47] that I guess I'm getting to and when ties back into this young female that asks this question.
[00:43:52] When you have to do is realize that in most of these cases, when you step outside of that little
[00:44:03] ecosystem, no one cares about that ecosystem. No one cares. No one cares. If I was to tell my mom,
[00:44:15] hey mom, I got my black belt in GJ2 2005. Hey mom, I got my black belt in GJ2.
[00:44:20] What would you say? Congratulations. No one's thinking that I'm going to strip
[00:44:26] mall doing karate somewhere. You know what I mean? That's what she's thinking. She doesn't care
[00:44:31] at all. She doesn't care at all. Your Porsche that you told me about, I can introduce you to many
[00:44:41] people that think if you spent more than $5,000 on a vehicle, you're an idiot. Never mind,
[00:44:50] $150,000. In fact, if you ever hear me brag about a vehicle, the vehicle that I brag about,
[00:44:57] probably the most is my 1997 Dodge Grand Carver. That's the one I brag about the most.
[00:45:03] So when you step outside the ecosystem of cool cars, people literally don't do not care.
[00:45:14] The music scene. Oh, I know this recording artist. I know, oh, I'm going to this studio. It's like,
[00:45:20] no one cares. So my point in saying this is if you find yourself distraught about your failure
[00:45:28] inside some random ecosystem, then remember that if you can detach and you can step outside
[00:45:35] that ecosystem, you can realize that that ecosystem, in most cases doesn't even matter at all. It doesn't matter
[00:45:42] at all. Detach. This is something that once again at Jockel Live shows this came up here. We
[00:45:53] talk about detachment. I talk about detachment or one of the things. Look, detachment is a great tool
[00:46:01] as a leader to have because it allows you to take a step back and see what's going on. Clearly,
[00:46:07] it's a powerful tool. But you combine that aspect of detachment to this other aspect of detachment
[00:46:16] when we've talked about people that get caught in a bad mental headspace and I don't know if I
[00:46:22] want to use the word depression because I'm not a psychologist and I've never really had this depression.
[00:46:26] So I can't really speak about it from that angle. But to say that people get caught in a rut,
[00:46:32] that happens. And I've talked about that idea. Like let's say, okay, when if you lose someone,
[00:46:40] right, someone that you know dies and you get put into that rut. And the way I've described it before
[00:46:48] is like there's a storm cloud all around your head. And no matter which direction you look, you see
[00:46:52] storm cloud. And anyone that's on the outside and this is what I've said, anyone that's on the outside,
[00:46:58] look, you go, oh man, you're just surrounded by the storm. If you step over here, you're going to
[00:47:03] get away from that. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. But from there perspective, they don't see it at
[00:47:08] all. If you can detach, if you can take a step back from your own head, you can actually see
[00:47:17] the end of the storm clouds and you can see that you can get your way out of this rut that you're in.
[00:47:23] Now people ask me about how to detach. And I talk about it leadership strategy and tactics,
[00:47:31] but I'm going to take a little bit further. Think about this. So here's a couple of things. And
[00:47:37] actually the reason that I I used to kind of look at it, like hey, it's real simple, right?
[00:47:45] Hey, take a step back. Just take a step back, take a breath, right? You know, look around.
[00:47:49] And in fact, relax, look around and make a call was what I wrote about extreme ownership when it
[00:47:53] comes to detach. Like relax, look around, make a call. That's detachment. The first time I really
[00:48:02] broke it down to try and give people some more specific instructions was on the warrior kid podcast.
[00:48:12] Because you know, a little kid would say, when I get mad, I start to lose my temper. When I'm
[00:48:18] wrestling or I start to lose my temper. When I'm in class and little Billy's keeps poking me
[00:48:23] in the back of the head. How do I not lose my temper? Well, what they need to do is detach. So
[00:48:28] I said, listen, take a step back. So I thought about what I kind of do. Take a step back.
[00:48:34] And one of the things I said was lift your chin up. Lift your chin up. And now when you start to think,
[00:48:44] I thought about, why do I even do that? What benefit does that have? Well, if you think about
[00:48:49] when you take a step back and you actually lift up your chin, think about what it does to your
[00:48:53] vision. All of a sudden, your vision is elevated. It's elevated one inch, but it's elevated. And you
[00:49:00] now have a physical new perspective. You have a physically new perspective of what's going on.
[00:49:06] If I take in a step back, lifting your chin up. The other thing it makes you do is if you put your
[00:49:12] head back, it like makes you open up your chest and open up your lungs and it makes you take a breath.
[00:49:19] Which I used to attribute this to when you're on the radio. Look, one of the reasons that I was
[00:49:24] that I like thought about detaching and something that I got realized was a good tool is you never
[00:49:29] want to sound panicked on the radio and the sealed teams. So before you key up that microphone
[00:49:36] to say something, you go when you say, all right, guys, we need to move towards that north building.
[00:49:43] Instead of, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't do that.
[00:49:47] So when you lift your chin up, you, you know, you kind of take a breath. It forces you to kind of take a breath.
[00:49:54] And the other, this is the coolest thing that I kind of connected this.
[00:49:57] Mm-hmm. At Jockel Live. And the reason I connected it because I was up like right now, we're
[00:50:03] sitting down and we're kind of, we're kind of stuck in this position. So at Jockel Live, I had
[00:50:08] like a, like a, a lava layer microphone on. It's all up and moving around and getting crazy.
[00:50:13] So as I was going through this, I was acting out the, the process of detaching. So I take a step
[00:50:22] back, I lift up my chin and I made this connection. I was like, think about the posture that you have
[00:50:30] when you're getting ready to get into a fight. It's literally the opposite. You lift up your hands,
[00:50:37] you duck, you tuck your chin down, you roll your shoulders forward to protect yourself,
[00:50:42] and you are getting in this defensive posture, which is not an open posture for seeing what's going on.
[00:50:50] Right? It's a focused posture. When you take a step back, you lift up your chin. You're actually
[00:50:54] making yourself physically vulnerable. And what you're also doing is here. So you're opening
[00:51:02] yourself up the threats, but you're opening up your mind to see a different perspective. So
[00:51:12] that is incredibly important. It's an incredibly important first step in training yourself,
[00:51:19] how to detach from all this chaos that's going on from the mayhem of the leadership situation,
[00:51:24] to detaching from your own ecosystem that you're wrapped up in that you think is important.
[00:51:30] That no one cares about. No one cares about outside that stupid club you're in. No one cares.
[00:51:40] No one cares. Outside the, the, the, the, the 38 people that are involved in your
[00:51:48] glee club that they've got you paranoid and freaking out no one cares. So if you can take a step back
[00:51:57] and you can see that and finally, if you can take a step back from your own brain and you can kind of
[00:52:01] assess that cloud that you're caught in. You'll see that that cloud is not infinite and you'll see that
[00:52:12] there's a way out, which is important. Very important. Yeah, that, that, and that can get more
[00:52:23] strong and powerful that that lure that suck in like keeping you in your ecosystem one. It's like
[00:52:29] part of your routine, you know, because it kind of feeds into your identity a lot of times like
[00:52:33] in your gits is super strong like where you, you know, if you get tapped out by a guy who never
[00:52:38] taps you out of some breath. That'll follow you all the way home with your fat and you know,
[00:52:42] your family you're thinking man, they can tap me out today. Like you can, you know,
[00:52:46] it's going to be a line that's just sucked in because it's kind of part of your identity,
[00:52:48] whatever, but yeah, if you can just step back, look around, kind of detach from that,
[00:52:55] you're like, Brad, no one cares like every literally every other environment that you go in in life,
[00:53:00] nobody cares like I tap. No one cares that you even do gits. No one cares that you got a
[00:53:04] spring interaction at the store. Yeah, and what was that? This would just work magic.
[00:53:09] This is an ninja. You put that to sleep. Exactly. Which is probably never going to happen
[00:53:15] by the way, as far as probability goes. I think, and I think when you're younger, I mean,
[00:53:21] obviously when you're younger, you get you get caught up in the ecosystem. Oh, it's more.
[00:53:24] And this what's scary is this can be the downfall of a kid, right? You get caught up in the drug
[00:53:31] ecosystem. You get caught up in the booze ecosystem. You get caught up in the in the
[00:53:38] one is it delinquency. Like, hey, I'm going to cause problem. Hey, you know what do boys do?
[00:53:45] Boy, this is another thing that came out of jockel life. Like, boys are trying to prove themselves
[00:53:51] to their friends and to themselves. How tough they are, how cool they are. So whenever
[00:53:59] whatever little ecosystem has their own little cool meters in it, right? And sometimes that
[00:54:03] cool meter is, you know, I'm getting so I'm going to drink this fifth jack. Yeah.
[00:54:11] Or I'm going to smoke this or whatever. Like, that's they want to move up in that ecosystem.
[00:54:15] And so they do stuff that outside, outside that ecosystem, people are, hey, that's actually one of
[00:54:22] the dumbest things I've ever heard. Yeah. But you can't see that. Yeah, the party scene is a big one.
[00:54:27] I mean, there's a difference between like getting caught in the ecosystem of the party scene and then
[00:54:32] going down the spiral of drugs and addiction. A lot of time, the addiction is like, that's just like
[00:54:37] a chemical payoff you get. And then that chemical payoff you want so much. It's just more of a payoff
[00:54:43] than literally anything else in life and then it just compounds. But it's the ecosystem that
[00:54:47] introduces you to the payoff that ends up being an addiction that ends up ruining your life.
[00:54:51] Yes. So, yeah. Like, the party scene, for example, it's like, yeah, okay,
[00:54:55] did you go to this party? Oh, you didn't go to there. You're kind of less than kind of thing.
[00:54:59] You know, oh, I'm at all the parties. You're the kind of up there in that little ecosystem.
[00:55:03] Then you go to those parties and you got a function at the party. Right. So you can just go to the
[00:55:07] party. Like, no, I'm not drinking. And one of them, you're like, oh, you're not feeding in the
[00:55:10] party at all. So you're going to fit in. So you're going to do the, you know, you're obviously going to
[00:55:14] drink and then what if they're doing some some other drugs in the back room, the cool room, the
[00:55:19] VIP room, the secret room or whatever. If you're not part of that, you're sort of like, yeah, you're the
[00:55:23] minion. You're not one of the VIPs. You're one of the VIPs. You're going to function there.
[00:55:27] There's a whole peer pressure thing wrapped up inside the ecosystem. Oh, yeah. That's like the
[00:55:31] primary driver of the ecosystem. Oh, yeah. Because even the positive things like, oh, where you get,
[00:55:36] where you, where you're getting your MBA? Yeah. Like, so like, got all these 18, well,
[00:55:41] no, 19, whatever, 20, 21 year old college kids are like, where you're going to get your MBA?
[00:55:46] Where you're going to get your MBA? Where you're flying? Where you're flying? Where you're flying?
[00:55:49] Oh, yeah. And if you're not applying to the whatever, then you're a little bit down on the
[00:55:55] ecosystem. And you know what? No one cares. Well, I can't say no one cares. Because there are
[00:56:01] people that are going, hey, we want to get someone from this school. Cool. Fine. That's a little tiny
[00:56:07] subset of the same ecosystem. Yeah. And but if you're talking about like, yeah, if you're talking
[00:56:11] about people outside the ecosystem, no, they don't care. They don't care if you're capable. And then
[00:56:16] so a lot of times, if you're like, oh, you got MBA from here. Okay, that's an established kid,
[00:56:20] you know, capable. They're going to put out some good students or some good trained people,
[00:56:24] whatever, then there's that. But it's not like, they don't care about what you care about right now.
[00:56:28] You know, the fact that you got it from here doesn't mean you're like awesome. The thing that's so
[00:56:33] hard for kids is they just can't see outside the ecosystem is their world. Yeah. And so
[00:56:40] introducing people to this concept that there are in fact, the random ecosystems that actually
[00:56:46] no one cares about is a positive thing. Yeah. Don't get caught up in them. Yeah. Don't keep caught
[00:56:53] on the trend. Yeah. Especially not negative ones. But yeah, what there's also people take positive
[00:56:59] ecosystems and turn them negative because they start getting the ego involved. Like,
[00:57:04] like, that's the right. Jiu-Jitsu is totally positive ecosystem. Hey, we're just here to train. We're
[00:57:07] here to have fun. And normal son, it turns into drama. As we haven't talked too much about the
[00:57:11] Jiu-Jitsu drama. And I, but you honest with you, one of the reasons that we don't talk a lot about the
[00:57:15] Jiu-Jitsu drama is probably because we don't deal with it a lot because we have a very open door
[00:57:21] policy at our gym. And we're just kind of cool. And we just want to train Jiu-Jitsu and
[00:57:27] want everyone else to train Jiu-Jitsu. And I think San Diego at large is a very similar to that
[00:57:31] because they're just Jiu-Jitsu everywhere. So we all just kind of know each other. And so I think that
[00:57:37] has something to do with it. And I also think there's less Jiu-Jitsu drama now than there was 10 years ago.
[00:57:43] Yeah, for sure. You know, 10 years ago is like, that's my student. You went to my other. You went
[00:57:47] to someone else's academy. Cool. You're out of my academy forever. I banish you.
[00:57:53] That was that kind of drama. Is there still that kind of drama? They're probably as some,
[00:57:56] but not as bad as it used to be. But they took a positive ecosystem and turned it into negative
[00:58:02] ecosystem. Yeah. Yeah, I would imagine that's kind of everything. Like even, okay, so my nephew
[00:58:07] gets good grades. Really good grades. But he takes it, you know how like certain students,
[00:58:12] they take their grades like super-series. They get one bag or their late for school. Like,
[00:58:17] proud of it. If to me, if let's say my mom brought me to school.
[00:58:21] But if you have to explain to me that you weren't worried about being late when you were 10,
[00:58:26] it's unnecessary. You're going wildly unnecessary for them. For the people,
[00:58:31] we'll let you explain how much you didn't care about leaving late even as a child. Go out.
[00:58:37] Especially for school. But in this way, if I was late, had to get a tardy slip.
[00:58:42] Brother, the connection between that and like grades and success in life was literally nonexistent.
[00:58:47] Brother, yeah. So in this way, it looks like the boss was late on. I would say,
[00:58:52] maybe that's how you ended up showing up late all the time. But God did it possible. Did you?
[00:58:57] Very possible. So if my parents were my mom or dad or whatever, if they were driving me to school,
[00:59:02] and they were running late? Well, I mean, me caring was literally at a zero. I didn't care at all.
[00:59:07] And that goes like, cool. I don't have to spend as much time at school. And not that I was bad at school or anything.
[00:59:13] I'm just saying like, right. I didn't care about that stuff at all. Anyway, my point is,
[00:59:16] some people are in the opposite. Some people were like, I can be late for school. It's like school is like everything in their grades.
[00:59:20] And stuff like that. That's positive. That's really good. Actually,
[00:59:23] but it can get out of hand. It's a thing. It's got to hand. Where you get kids freaking. You get kids cheating.
[00:59:29] Cheating, freaking out. Freaking out. Freaking out.
[00:59:31] Now, taking weird drugs to like study like a lot of whatever. Yeah. All those things. All those things are bad.
[00:59:36] And all of them are related to the fact that they think that that ecosystem is the whole world.
[00:59:40] Everything. And let's be honest. I mean, how much of that ecosystem affect you? You didn't even show up at school.
[00:59:47] What do you want me homework? You seem to be doing all right?
[00:59:50] I'm not even. Well, now you're here kicking the podcast ecosystem. Echo Jaws.
[00:59:56] Oh, yeah. So everyone should do that. Right. No, man. Yeah, crazy. Yeah, I think if if you take
[01:00:05] and not not that I'm like the epitome of or the poster child for great parenting advice,
[01:00:10] nothing like this, but I think like the more you take your kids and see other stuff outside of school.
[01:00:16] Kind of their mind is going to not just be attached to like the school scenario. You know? Well, that's a whole
[01:00:22] debate, you know, that you could have like, but here's a real simple question.
[01:00:28] Is your kid, if your kid goes, is your kid 10 years old, they're in fifth grade.
[01:00:33] And they don't want to miss school. So they don't go with you to,
[01:00:38] call it, whatever, cry. They don't go experience something. Like, yeah, that I guarantee you that the
[01:00:44] experience in Kauai is way more beneficial, educationally, spiritually,
[01:00:53] athletically, then hey, they missed three days of math. Yeah, bring the math book.
[01:01:00] Bring it. Yeah, for sure. And that's just Kauai either. Like, you know, I mean, even just going to
[01:01:06] see what you do at work or whatever, like I just take my kid to, you know, going training sites.
[01:01:16] Are you kidding me? Best thing ever. Oh, yeah. And I'm not even necessarily saying have a
[01:01:20] miss school to see this stuff. I'm not necessarily saying that. But I'm just saying like,
[01:01:25] everything isn't like, okay, go home, do homework. And it's like everything. If you
[01:01:29] create this idea that school is everything in their head, then, you know, it's, they're going to
[01:01:36] tend to think that I think. But, you know, if you see, you know, let them see other places where you
[01:01:42] work or whatever, whether you're in the weekends or summertime or whatever, you know, see just the
[01:01:45] other things that it realized, okay, school isn't everything, you know. And what you're really showing
[01:01:49] them is this is one ecosystem in the world. It's called school. It's an important one, but there's
[01:01:55] no reason to get crazy. There's other ecosystems out there that are also cool and good.
[01:02:03] All right, keep detached. Don't get stuck in ecosystems. All right, next question. I am stuck in a
[01:02:12] prolonged period of things not going my way professionally or socially. All that really is going on.
[01:02:19] Well, is my time management still, even after having owned up to my part in getting here,
[01:02:26] I still seem stuck in a failure loop. Okay, so, what's being addressed here is
[01:02:40] the prolonged period of things not going away. And we know that a key part of getting out of a
[01:02:46] rut like this or a failure loop is taking ownership of those failures of those problems.
[01:02:58] That's very important. But guess what? That alone doesn't solve them at all.
[01:03:06] Just saying I didn't get promoted. Okay, it was my fault. Period. That doesn't solve the fact that you didn't
[01:03:14] get promoted. I'm not getting called back to do this other contracting job. It's my fault.
[01:03:20] Does that mean you get called back? No, it doesn't mean anything.
[01:03:26] Taking ownership means that you actually have to identify the problem. You know your
[01:03:32] responsible for it. And then you actually have to solve the problem. That's what you have to do.
[01:03:37] Just taking ownership of the problem doesn't make it go away. If you take ownership of the
[01:03:40] problem, you have to take ownership of finding a solution. And then you have to take ownership
[01:03:44] of implementing that solution. So this is real straightforward. Now, there's one little tiny part
[01:03:51] that I want to point out, which you may or may not have noticed echo Charles and I'm going to point it out.
[01:03:58] So pay attention to this last sentence in the question. Still, even after having owned up to
[01:04:06] my part in getting here, I still seem stuck in a failure. Failure loop. What you noticed about
[01:04:14] that echo Charles? As if there's another part of all of the part, maybe even parts.
[01:04:20] Right, there's multiple facets of the world that are conspiring to keep you in this failure loop.
[01:04:29] Yeah, it's like that tone of when someone's like, hey, I did my part. I did my job hands-up,
[01:04:35] you know, kind of thing. I did my job. That's not my job. The other parts that are more implied,
[01:04:39] I guess, now that you kind of uncover in the world. It's like there's this other job that someone
[01:04:43] else is sort of part. So this is the thing. And this is what this is what makes this very challenging.
[01:04:51] Is this idea that like, but how could I possibly control this or that? How can I possibly
[01:05:03] take ownership of the fact now? This is a weak one. How can I possibly take ownership of the fact
[01:05:09] that my boss is an idiot and fired me? How can that be my fault? That he didn't see how good I was,
[01:05:16] right? Okay, we see what's going on there. You obviously aren't being introspective and taking a
[01:05:21] look and saying, okay, this is obviously my fault. Here's what I need to change. So there's things
[01:05:27] like that where you go, look, you're just not, it was same thing with relationships, right? She broke
[01:05:34] up with me. How can I own that? Well, maybe you look at yourself and you see how you acted as a
[01:05:40] partner in that relationship. And if you just want to look at that person, say it was her fault,
[01:05:45] she was crazy. And it was her fault, she didn't understand how awesome I was. That's not, that you,
[01:05:54] you need to take ownership of your own behavior. Why did she think that? Now you do get to these
[01:06:00] things where you have no control. So got asked a question, a guy said, my, I lost my girlfriend to
[01:06:17] you, opiate overdose, did she died? How do I take ownership of that? And so I expanded that
[01:06:27] question because that's one of those things where you look at, you know, when you look at,
[01:06:32] you go, how can you take ownership of that? This person did so much drugs and it wasn't like,
[01:06:40] like, okay, I don't know the specifics of the situation, but if you know, I'm doing everything
[01:06:45] I can to help my girlfriend and then one day I come home and she's, oh, deed, she's dead.
[01:06:53] Okay, how can I say, I wasn't even there, right? And I, let's just say, I've done everything,
[01:07:01] take her to rehab, not all this stuff. And as far as I could tell, she was clean and behind my
[01:07:07] back without telling me, at least she did this, right? So it's almost like, okay, that's as much
[01:07:11] separation as I can get. How do you take ownership of a situation like that? And so it
[01:07:17] here's what I went on to say to this guy. I said this might seem like a unique situation, but it's
[01:07:24] not because there's things that occur in our lives that we actually don't have any control over.
[01:07:29] For instance, most horrible, you, your family member, someone, you know, gets cancer, gets a
[01:07:36] horrible, terminal disease. How do you take ownership of that? And the answer is, in these cases,
[01:07:45] when things that are truly beyond your control occur, what you take ownership of is how you respond to them.
[01:07:53] That's, that's what you take ownership. How do you respond to, you lose your girlfriend to drugs,
[01:08:00] your kid gets cancer, you get cancer, something, you get this horrible disease. How do you respond to that?
[01:08:05] That's what you can take ownership of. And that's what you have to take ownership of.
[01:08:11] So I get, as my point in saying that is, yes, there are absolutely things that you cannot control
[01:08:17] and what you can control is your reaction to them when they unfold. That makes sense. What scares me
[01:08:23] about this guy is he's saying he's owned up to his part, but that means he's blaming someone else.
[01:08:32] And I can, the amount of things that we have is zero control over is a very small. So many things
[01:08:39] if we look at ourselves and say, what could I do better, what could I do different? How can I make an adjustment here?
[01:08:46] How can I adapt to the way this boss is? How can I adapt to the way this girl is that I'm trying to have
[01:08:53] relationship and then by the way, that might not be the best relationship. Maybe that's part of what you need to do.
[01:08:57] This take ownership of the fact that you're addicted to this, this is what he's saying. This guy
[01:09:02] here saying he's so social, some of his, some of his got some problems with his
[01:09:08] female friends, right? Or friends in general. Hey, do you want to want to come watch UFC?
[01:09:14] Oh, not really. I'm buying guys. That's okay. We're going to go to, you know,
[01:09:20] oh, is there a watch that by myself? I can't believe that. You know, what's wrong with everyone else?
[01:09:26] No, actually, what's wrong with me? Now truth be told. I don't want to watch UFC with anybody else,
[01:09:32] generally. I just want to sit alone and watch the fight. No commentary. No questions.
[01:09:39] I asked me a question. Sure. What was that move? No. I'm watching the fight.
[01:09:46] That's interesting. Everyone just be quiet. A lot of times, some of us, we like to demonstrate our
[01:09:51] professional knowledge of the subject, you know? So answer here. You need to look at the reason
[01:10:02] that you're probably stuck in this loop continually is because the things that you're
[01:10:07] blaming on other people take ownership of them, get them fixed, take ownership of them, get
[01:10:12] them fixed, take ownership of make some moves, take ownership of them, look what you can do different.
[01:10:16] That's what you have to do. Jack, so. Next question. In your recent book,
[01:10:31] Leadership Strategy and Tactics mentioned establishing trustworthy relationships with
[01:10:35] superiors, you speak of performance and compelling tasks. You're stating tasks. Oh,
[01:10:41] completing tasks. Yes. Performance and completing tasks. You stated, boss wants me to fill out some
[01:10:46] extra paperwork. I'll do it. Boss needs me to cover a shift for someone else on the team. I've got
[01:10:52] it. Boss has a nasty low reward mission that needs executing. I'm all over it, page 40 and 50.
[01:11:00] How does this separate you from being a yes man, especially when being a yes man is looked
[01:11:05] upon so negatively these days? What are your thoughts? Yes, so there's actually maybe he hasn't
[01:11:09] gotten there, but there's a whole section in the book that's called the S-Man. And why you don't
[01:11:14] want to be a yes man? Because if you're a yes man, you don't push back when a situation requires
[01:11:20] there to be pushed back. So, read a little bit more, but to make it quite simple,
[01:11:30] being a yes man is saying yes to everything regardless of whether it's a good idea or not.
[01:11:34] Building relationships and establishing a good communication and a good rapport with your
[01:11:44] superior is totally different than being a yes man. Part of it is saying yes, because if you resist
[01:11:49] everything that they say to you, they don't really think they don't really value your opinion. They
[01:11:54] just know that you're just a no man, no we can't do no can't, you're your Mr. Negative.
[01:11:59] Mr. A yes man is just going to do whatever. So what you do is you say yes when you can.
[01:12:06] Some meanial tasks, as we talk about some extra paperwork, cool, I'll do it. Some some
[01:12:10] cover shift for someone else's cool, I got it. I can do those things. Those are easy. They're
[01:12:13] not impacting my team. We're good. Nasty, low reward project that needs to get done cool, I got it.
[01:12:19] Let's go bring it. Bring it. I'm here. It's going to help the team. Awesome.
[01:12:23] Oh, you want me to do something that's going to negatively affect the team and put massive amounts
[01:12:30] of capital at jeopardy or put people in risk or put safety at risk. Do I want me to do that? Hold on,
[01:12:36] boss. No. And I wouldn't be just no boss. I'm not doing it. But I go through the book. How you
[01:12:43] actually approach those situations so that you're not a yes man. So when it comes to situations
[01:12:50] that unfolds that you actually need to say no, you can say no and it gets listened to.
[01:12:58] That's the difference. Leadership strategy, intacters get some. So when they're kind of,
[01:13:05] so many of the questions, Ian leadership strategy and tactics, there's so many of the answers
[01:13:10] that I'd given there are based on questions that I get asked all the time. And so really, so many
[01:13:16] of the questions that I'm hearing now, I have the answer and leadership strategy and tactics.
[01:13:21] I'm trying not to just say, well, refer to the book. It's 98. Oh, refer to the book page 64.
[01:13:27] I'm trying not to do that. But just FYI, refer anyone that's out there. It's in there. Read more about it.
[01:13:35] All right. Next question. I was hoping for some guy, kind of a similar question. Two.
[01:13:40] But go on. Yes. Let's bring first some guy. I'm going to cut you off again. No, I just did that
[01:13:45] for fun. I thought I did it. Anyway, I was hoping for some guidance on how to play the game
[01:13:55] with a situation at work. I work in an aerospace machine shop. I'm doing this apprenticeship to be a
[01:14:01] machinist. Machinist, machinist, machinist. This means that I'm supposed to get specific types of
[01:14:08] on the job training with a set number of hours each with a set number of hours each. Okay. I go to school.
[01:14:16] Once we're going to re-roll this thing, huh? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to roll it. Yeah,
[01:14:20] hey, you know, I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. I'm a man. Decern kind of what he's asking at the end of the day.
[01:14:25] Anyway, set numbers are normally you get a little sensitive if you make some mistakes. I
[01:14:28] am just going to take this from the top. But my whole life is at one weakness. Take so put
[01:14:32] in. Come on. It's an expression. Anyway, I go to school once a week to supplement it. The problem is
[01:14:39] they won't give me any work that feels those designations. I'm doing my best at the
[01:14:46] menial paperwork they've had had me on for a while without complaint. It's a real problem, though.
[01:14:51] When I'm paying out of pocket for this tuition, they come with the program. Every month spent,
[01:14:57] not getting required training ads to the five years it takes to complete the OJT on the job training.
[01:15:03] How do I get them to move me where I'm supposed to be? Do I just continue to do the best at what
[01:15:09] they give me? I'm going to accept the loss of time and money. Yeah, so you can remember the book
[01:15:13] that I caught me of leadership humble, not passive. So this guy is being humble playing the game.
[01:15:18] Hey, I'll do the medial paperwork. I'll all work these extra hours. I'll do these things that
[01:15:22] don't really help me. He's playing the game and he's being humble, right? But he's also it sounds like
[01:15:28] being passive, meaning he needs to up his assertiveness to say, hey, listen, hey, hey, boss, I just
[01:15:34] want to let you know. I put together this spreadsheet of what I've actually get to get accomplished.
[01:15:39] And here's the things that I want to get done and I know I'm trying to knock out all the
[01:15:41] stuff and I'm here to support the team. But I also need to get these things done. Can you help me
[01:15:46] get these things scheduled so that I can be more value to you and the team? So yeah, you build the
[01:15:53] relationship through playing the game. You build the relationship by giving support wherever you can,
[01:15:59] but at the same time, that doesn't mean that you just roll over and never stand up for yourself.
[01:16:06] That's not what we're talking about here. The difference is you're not building a relationship just
[01:16:11] so you can take care of yourself, right? That's different. That means I'm just looking out for me.
[01:16:17] You're building a relationship so that you can move down the right path, which by the way is going to
[01:16:21] make you more a bigger asset to the team. So it's a win-win situation. Make sure you build that
[01:16:28] relationship and then talk to them about what is you're trying to get done, why you're trying to get
[01:16:32] it done? And that way we move forward down the path. And by the way, if they're like shut up and just
[01:16:37] do this paperwork or shut up, we're not going to help you. Cool. Maybe we need to find a place that
[01:16:42] has a little bit better opportunity for me and I'll start to float that out there. Humble, not passive.
[01:16:52] I remember a long time ago you'd say, you used this word efficient. Be more efficient,
[01:16:58] rather than make it easier for me, even though they're essentially the same thing in certain
[01:17:02] circumstances where it's like, oh yeah, this will make it easier for me to become an asset,
[01:17:06] kind of thing. But for whatever reason maybe just the way that sounds. Yeah, sounds like you're
[01:17:10] not for yourself, man. Yeah. Yeah. But if you say, it'll get me to be a more valuable asset in a
[01:17:17] more efficient way. Who could say no to that? Because what company doesn't want efficiency? No,
[01:17:23] we want to take the hard road. We want to do things that don't make any sense. We want to do things
[01:17:29] inefficient way. No. Yes, efficiency is important. Not only in GJ2, not only in judo, but in business
[01:17:38] of life. Yes, sir. All right. So there's one more little topic that I wanted to bring up. And
[01:17:49] really it's another question that I got at Jockel Live and I got this
[01:17:54] question or a version of this question a couple of different times and they all, they all.
[01:18:06] Couple different versions of this question but the same question. And the question is,
[01:18:08] it's something like this, something along the lines of, I've been pretty successful at this point
[01:18:16] in my life. And I'm having trouble finding the motivation to take it to the next level.
[01:18:28] So you know, it's like people say, oh, so you know, you make decent money, yep, but we got,
[01:18:33] yeah, we're doing really well and you're working out, yep, I'm going to healthy, yep,
[01:18:37] I'm good, yeah, you're family's taking care of you out, I'm good, good, good time with my family.
[01:18:40] But you're not able to like get the extra workout, you're not, you know, you're skipping some days,
[01:18:47] you're not eating great, you're not making the calls that you need to make, you're not expanding your
[01:18:51] eyes and that's what's going on, right? And so that's what we're getting at. We get someone that's sort of
[01:18:55] in a good spot, kind of across the board, right? Kind of in a good spot across the board. And so I'd
[01:19:00] kind of establish that fact that they're in a good spot across the board. And then I'd say,
[01:19:06] but it sounds like you're in a good spot across the board, are you happy with that and are you
[01:19:12] comfortable with where you're at? And the answer would be no. And then I'd say, are you sure?
[01:19:23] And then it's a yam, sure, I want to do more. And then I said, that's a lie. That's a lie. That's a lie,
[01:19:44] because if you really weren't happy and you really wanted to improve your health even more
[01:19:52] and you really wanted to improve your financial situation more. And you really wanted to just
[01:19:57] broadly improve your life, then you wouldn't have any problem at all finding the discipline.
[01:20:06] The discipline would actually find you. That's where I'm at. You want to know why people
[01:20:14] go, you don't see pretty much, you want to know why? Because this one finds me, because I know
[01:20:19] I know I can do more. And I want to do more. And I know I'm not happy or I'm at a comfortable
[01:20:24] where I'm at. So if you're telling yourself, no, I'm not happy where you're at, then I'm going
[01:20:30] to tell you that's actually a lie. You are comfortable. You are comfortable, because if you
[01:20:35] weren't comfortable, then it would drive you the discipline would show up. Now this is where
[01:20:43] I kind of, I kind of have to go a little bit deeper. So what I just said, if you tell yourself
[01:20:53] the truth, then you'll find discipline. The framework of discipline is the truth.
[01:21:04] The framework of discipline is the truth. And I didn't do a good job when I got to ask this
[01:21:12] question. I didn't do a good job of connecting all the dots because it actually is one level deeper.
[01:21:21] It's one level deeper. It looks like this. If you're saying that you can't find discipline
[01:21:32] and I'm telling you it's because that's because you are comfortable where you're at.
[01:21:37] That is also a lie. That is also a lie. Look, telling yourself that
[01:21:52] you don't need to get out of bed in the morning, telling yourself that you don't really need to
[01:21:57] work out or you don't need to go harger or you don't need to do more in your job or be more
[01:22:03] disciplined in the way that you live. If you tell yourself those things, that's actually a lie.
[01:22:17] Because the fact of the matter is, think about this, the fact of the matter is that you're not
[01:22:23] comfortable. You're not happy. You're not okay with where you're up because that's why you're asking
[01:22:30] this question right now. You're asking this question because you know you can do more. You know
[01:22:38] you can be more and that's the truth. That's the truth and it eats you up and it makes you
[01:22:48] ask these questions, ask the question to me and ask the question to yourself and the answer is the truth.
[01:22:59] You know it, I know it, we all know it that the framework of discipline is the truth.
[01:23:09] If you tell yourself the truth, the real truth, the absolute categorical, unconditional,
[01:23:17] unabated, unmersible truth. If you do that, you will find discipline.
[01:23:28] Discipline equals freedom. Discipline is rooted in the truth. The truth will set you free.
[01:23:35] And what does that calculus work out to? Discipline equals freedom. And I think that's
[01:23:52] all I've got for tonight. So, echo Charles. It seems like we want the truth over here.
[01:24:03] Yes. So that we can do more and we can be more. Is there anything that you know of
[01:24:11] that helps reveal the truth to us? Yes, due to the facts never lie. When you make eye contact with
[01:24:24] that guy who's little bit better than you, maybe bigger, maybe we'll give you a scenario where you
[01:24:31] got to put out more effort that maybe you want to do that day when you make eye contact and then you
[01:24:35] like look away. Oh, you mean pre-roll. Oh, there's like a scenario that could unfold but we haven't
[01:24:43] connected eye contact for the role. It's like avoidance. Yeah, oh, everybody knows. That's one of
[01:24:53] the many attempted lies that we sort of try to perpetuate in ourselves. Like, oh yeah, like, I'm good,
[01:25:02] right? That's what people kind of. They want to be good at jujitsu, I think, you know, on the mat's,
[01:25:10] you know Akbar? Sure, of course it did. Yeah. He's really sick jujitsu and he's super like hard to
[01:25:18] roll with just because he's strong and wiring athletic and freaking good and doesn't stop. Yeah.
[01:25:24] But I have like an unwritten rule with him no matter what 100%. If if either one of us wants to roll,
[01:25:30] we roll. Yeah. Doesn't matter what's going on. If one of us wants to roll, we roll. Yeah. And most of
[01:25:34] the time he wants to roll, I don't. And I roll them every time. Yeah. Yeah, that's how. And in that
[01:25:42] kind, I mean, let's face it that like you have mixed emotions about those kind of, because you see
[01:25:48] him and you're like, because you have it in your head, like you can't not roll with that person.
[01:25:51] I have that with Noah, where if he's there, it's like, it's on. And he's like, I don't know if
[01:25:58] man, he's been kind of working me recently. Yeah. So I say, oh man, I see him. I'm like,
[01:26:02] I know this is going to be like a hard roll, but I can't not roll with him. Like that would
[01:26:06] defeat the whole purpose of my existence here right now. If like, don't roll with them, you know,
[01:26:10] roll with Noah for sure. And he's the same way. He's coming out you the whole time. He's freaking
[01:26:15] awesome at you, Jitsu. Yeah. He's in good shape. He's strong. He's got, he's just got it. He's
[01:26:20] just going to bring it. Yeah. He's got to be, he's like, that's the way it is. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So,
[01:26:24] Noah, Akbar, like these guys that it's like, okay, if they weren't here, it would be an
[01:26:31] easier day regardless. Well, I don't know. But not everyone's like that, you know. And actually
[01:26:37] there can be guys who are like, even actually better than you, but you roll with them in it's like,
[01:26:40] it's not this huge, like, it's not that like hard of a roll. You know, it's like there's just
[01:26:45] different things. Yeah. But the lie that we can tell ourselves even though you're the only one
[01:26:52] you're laying to everyone, every can see what you're doing. When you'd like do avoid that. Yeah.
[01:26:57] Now, there are situations that unfold, then this is one that I do. So let's say I have an injury.
[01:27:03] Right. Legitimate injury. I will, let's say a normal day for me is like, okay, I'm going to do
[01:27:10] eight rounds. You know, eight, six minute rounds. Cool. That's normal. Like that's a good roll for me.
[01:27:15] I had a good time. You know, whatever takes an hour, whatever. He's a minute rast. Whatever.
[01:27:20] So, so maybe not. But anyways, if I'm injured, sometimes I got to be like, okay, I can only
[01:27:28] do four rounds because then it's just odds that I'm going to re-enter some stupid. And I just,
[01:27:35] I'm like, hey, what I try to do is tell people beforehand. So that way, I'm not being that guy.
[01:27:41] Like, if you want to roll with me now, it's the time. Because in four rolls, maybe five.
[01:27:48] Sure. You know, then I'm going to call it. Yeah. So it does happen. And I guess the reason that I'm
[01:27:55] saying that is just to be like, well, I'm going to roll no matter what. If you're injured,
[01:28:00] and like you know the deal, like when you're injured, you can, you can get lucky for like three
[01:28:06] four rolls. And like, okay, I didn't tweak anything. We're good. It didn't get worse. That fourth
[01:28:11] fifth roll, now you're six roll, you're tired. You're giving up a little bit more and all of a sudden,
[01:28:17] that's when you get hurt. So just a little tail of caution. Yes, big time. And, you know,
[01:28:24] one, it's easy kind of like when we're just sitting here, you know, not in the situation. It's
[01:28:30] easy to be like, oh, yeah, you just, you just work around the injury. And if you got to get
[01:28:35] caught in a submission, a towel, you know, it's not a submission that you're going to get. That's easy.
[01:28:39] You hope that someone, if you've got a sore elbow, you hope that what hurts you is, oh, someone
[01:28:44] puts an arm walk and you go, oh, tap early. Right. That's what you hope it is. What you don't hope
[01:28:49] it is is you're rolling and turning and your arm gets caught in a bad spot. And now you re-indra.
[01:28:53] Yeah. There's no tapping from that. That's just another injury. Yeah. So the way I mean,
[01:28:57] what I had in my head was like, um, or, you know, your knee or whatever, whatever, whatever,
[01:29:02] rib, whatever. And you're like, I'm just going to go like kind of little lighter, you know,
[01:29:07] right? Exactly. You roll one round and then you roll one round with like, no, or something,
[01:29:13] go light, no way, man. And it's, you can consciously be going, oh, yeah, I'm going to go light.
[01:29:18] But start rolling. Yeah, just see how much you can remember to go light when you're, you know,
[01:29:22] things can't compare to that. Whatever. Sure. You always say to me like, when you do a good
[01:29:26] move to me and you say, uh, yeah, you sense furgents. Yeah, you say, that's a big victory for you.
[01:29:32] You're my sense of urgency to increase and it's like the biggest W. Oh, yeah, because you're just so good.
[01:29:37] And you say it to me too. Well, I don't say that. It's a big W, but I do say I recognize
[01:29:42] what sense of urgency. You're all on TV. Anyway, when you're in the moment,
[01:29:50] whether you can control it fully or not or whatever, I would say you just decrease the chance of
[01:29:56] you staying safe as time goes on. Yes. You just, that's just like the numbers. Yeah,
[01:30:01] like just like odds odds odds are made it through four rounds. I'm okay. Right. I'm walking off the
[01:30:08] mat right now. Right. So that's like the opposite of a lie. You're like being so, so truthful with
[01:30:14] yourself. You're like, hey, you know, and you're, and you're doing the right thing. The lie comes
[01:30:19] when you're like, you're not injured. You're just maybe not feeling up to it. Maybe you're hung
[01:30:24] over. I don't know. Maybe that you put, you know, a person. And then you say, well, you know,
[01:30:30] I'm this or I'm sick or I'm this and you say that excuse whoever to yourself and then like
[01:30:35] you avoid the whole rules. Yeah, I had Wes. Like I was trained and I was deep into some rounds
[01:30:43] and Wes's and Wes was on the other mat and he comes over and Wes is a beast too. Like,
[01:30:47] I mean, he's just strong and strategic to. It's awesome. And every time it's going to be a gut check.
[01:30:52] And I'm like sit up against the wall. I'm done. And he's like, you want to get one? And I was like,
[01:30:59] and I said, no, you know, I was like, no. And then I was like, bro, and then like 30 seconds went by.
[01:31:06] And I was like, all right, bro. I'm sorry. That's just a week. Like, because I wasn't done yet.
[01:31:10] I knew I wasn't done. There's times where I've been like, hey, no, I can't roll. Like, I've got a,
[01:31:15] I'm, no, I'm done for the night. It's not smart for me to roll. I need to have discipline.
[01:31:21] The more than anything else, right? Because you know, when you're injured, you're there,
[01:31:25] it's like, you want to roll so bad. You feel like a caged animal. Just wanted to get on the
[01:31:31] mats of justice. Yeah, pretty much any time you're there and you're not ruling injured. It's the worst
[01:31:37] man working in my case, you know, filming whatever. Yeah. No, I mean, you can't. That's just how,
[01:31:43] but yeah. But again, that's like the opposite of the lie. Like your, your truth is, is very,
[01:31:50] how should I say strong? Like, you don't like the lie, like, hits you hard when you begin to lie to yourself.
[01:32:01] You know, but some people, they can just roll with it, but everyone sees what you're doing.
[01:32:06] Everybody, you know, or the guy who's tying his belt every 10 seconds, you know, like,
[01:32:10] you know, basically what you're doing. Yeah, you're trying to perpetuate somewhere. Yeah. But the mats,
[01:32:15] they don't lie. So that's why we think, GJJ is a positive thing. Sure, I think so.
[01:32:23] It does expose our truth or maintain our truth. It's a good act, one system to be in. I think so.
[01:32:30] You gotta be careful, like all ecosystems. But in that ecosystem, this is what we do care about.
[01:32:37] What can you be? Yeah. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. Come on, we all check it out, like,
[01:32:43] oh, like, put it this way. We don't want to be walking on with a second rate,
[01:32:47] G, that's made in wherever, not here. Yeah. Yes. No, we don't. What do you want your G to say? Look,
[01:32:55] I train GJJ too. I work hard. And I support this country and it's workers. Yes. That's what I want my
[01:33:04] G to say. Yeah. There's only one G that says that. Yeah. But there's only one G that says that. Yeah.
[01:33:09] And that's the origin G. And I think we all know that. You know, so yes, the question,
[01:33:13] what do you do I get? One, I do GJ to when I start GJ to when I compete in GJ to you get an origin G.
[01:33:21] Yes. You get an origin, Rashguard for the no-ghi scenarios set unfold. And then, since you can't
[01:33:28] wear a G and a Rashguard in public, unless you're John Donner, her, the exeases represent that Rash.
[01:33:36] Is he still represent the Rashguard super hardcore as far as I know, but no, he's definitely
[01:33:41] so legit. We need to send him some Rashcarts. Anyways, if you're not John Donner, and you're going
[01:33:47] to go out, you don't really want to wear G pants and a Rashguard, you can get other clothing
[01:33:53] from origin made such as T shirts, jeans, sweatshirts, hoodies, what are you going to say? I think
[01:34:03] sweatshirts and hoodies kind of covers it covers it. Okay, what are you going to say? You're going to
[01:34:08] say jeans? Yeah. G jeans. Delta 68. Delta 68 are those out. Yeah. Yeah. We're working on that.
[01:34:18] I can't. Hey, working on it. Hey, if you're working on it, you're working on it.
[01:34:20] All good. I actually told Pete, let's put it. And I don't like to do this, but let's do the pre order
[01:34:25] thing. So we can actually get the demand signal because people are demanding the Delta 68.
[01:34:31] Yes, yeah. Because I talked them up because they are truly the greatest things I've ever put
[01:34:37] on my legs. There you go. Also, joggers, those are not the greatest things I put on my legs. You know,
[01:34:46] but we're not really for me. Not a jogger's kind of guy. Because you don't, well, yeah. I mean,
[01:34:51] you know, fashionably speaking, yeah, that's not you. You know, that's kind of down there on your
[01:34:56] list of priorities. So I get it right now. Those are just two things that I'm not really super
[01:35:00] concerned. Although oddly enough, the comfort of the Delta 68 is one of the things that makes
[01:35:06] them is very epic. Yeah. It's just like the cherry on top. If you came to Jockel Live, I was
[01:35:12] wearing Delta 68. If you see me in public and I'm wearing jeans, they're Delta 68.
[01:35:18] Jogging. There you go. Originmain.com is where. Also, supplements. These are important supplements.
[01:35:26] Jolens. For your joints. Supplements for your joints. That's important. Try live. You can be the
[01:35:33] strongest guy in the world. You should show. There's not working. Let me ask you this. Is this jacked up?
[01:35:36] So a guy hit me up on social media and was like, hey, you're old. How do you, how do you
[01:35:45] maintain? Like, how do you do this? And you know, I, there's one of those things, what was I
[01:35:50] like? Well, do I just tell them like straight up, man? If you're not on joint warfare and acrylic oil,
[01:35:56] you're just wrong. Like, step number one, get on joint warfare and acrylic oil. Seriously. Super
[01:36:01] krill joint warfare. That's what you want to do. Now, the thing that I told them also is very
[01:36:09] consistent. Right. I'm not one of those guys that takes three weeks off from doing anything and
[01:36:15] then jumps back into the two squat. Like, no, I'm working out for all practical purposes. I'm
[01:36:24] working out every single day. Now, is the occasions where life gets in the way? Sure. Yep. That's
[01:36:31] what it's called a day off. That's why I don't take voluntary days off. But I'm telling you, if you
[01:36:38] want to maintain like the activity at a high level and you're an older person, I mean, I'm only
[01:36:48] 48. I feel like I'm 21 or 22, maybe. Let's say 27. How about that? Sure. But joint warfare and
[01:36:58] acrylic oil. Those are the supplements that you're specifically talking about right now. So,
[01:37:03] I can't recommend them strongly enough. And I should have just told that guy, listen, be consistent,
[01:37:07] work out, do a good job, warm up and take acrylic oil and joint warfare. But then you feel like,
[01:37:11] oh, I'm just, you know, you don't even sell them as good as stuff like, bro, this is it. So I actually
[01:37:17] did him a disservice. Yeah. Because that's true. When you go like every day in consistent, your body
[01:37:22] started, you know, for lack of a better way of putting it in as far as details go. But you're
[01:37:26] by just used to it. But at the same time, yeah, you know, like your joints are taking a meeting.
[01:37:30] If you're pushing hard, which I am, which, yeah, I mean, why would I? I mean, I guess maybe there's
[01:37:35] under some circumstance that's okay. But if you're pushing hard, yeah, you're joint's going to be like,
[01:37:41] kind of taking some of the front. Yeah, for sure. You know, so yeah, if your joints can see in the
[01:37:46] game, but it's like, yeah, well, no, more important. If you're joints can't stay in the game,
[01:37:50] you're out of the game. Yes. That's the problem. Yeah, that's the, that's the, like, hey, you can be
[01:37:55] big and strong. And your joints don't work, it doesn't matter. You're, it's only strong as your
[01:37:59] weakest link. Make your weakest link. Your strongest link. Join Warfare and Krooel. Discipline,
[01:38:07] discipline, powder form, awesome. If you need a can of a tasty beverage, that's actually good for you.
[01:38:16] Get yourself some discipline. Go. RTD. Ready to deploy. Yes. Or drink with. Yeah, we prefer to play over here.
[01:38:25] I think. I understand. Also, milk protein in the form of a dessert. Additional protein. I
[01:38:32] don't know where you can stick. I get it. It's true. It's good. But you want the dessert with some
[01:38:37] additional protein. Some to increase and improve your protein synthesis. Yeah.
[01:38:45] Just got hit to that one. It's like when there's protein. Okay, so I was one of the guys who,
[01:38:50] who, who, one of the many of us, who, you know what, you don't want to animal like window is?
[01:38:56] Yeah, it's like after you work out, you got to certain amount of time. Yeah, you got to eat within. Yeah,
[01:39:00] you got to eat the protein and take cake in in because that's when your body like kind of wants
[01:39:03] to take it in. If you miss that window, it doesn't take as much in. So apparently,
[01:39:09] that's not as much of a thing. From what I'm, bro science has been this green in the 1940.
[01:39:16] Well, there's been controversy in the broscience world. No man, just a shift really.
[01:39:22] A shift paradigm. A paradigm shift. The broscience world. So interesting.
[01:39:27] So I come from someone that has a doctorate in broscience, echoed roles. You know, I'm
[01:39:31] at least staying on this. So what do you think is the point? We can drink milk anytime.
[01:39:38] There's another one we're really having. Milk at 9.48 at night when I'm like, you know what,
[01:39:43] I want to surf right now. Cool. I'm going to have some milk. Yeah. Yeah, basically. Yeah. So it's more
[01:39:49] about the protein rolling around in your system generally speaking. And you know, when your body
[01:39:54] needs protein to rebuild muscle, boom, you got some protein already in there. Whether you take it in
[01:39:59] 20 minutes after you lift or if you know, you just sort of taking it in throughout the day.
[01:40:05] Same thing goes for your children. They can take in protein at any time. They can also take
[01:40:10] in poison sugar. But don't give them that, give them the protein to good stuff. War your kid
[01:40:15] milk. And then get yourself some jocquoise tea, by the way. Which is as echoed, Charles likes to
[01:40:21] point out organic. It is certified. Hi. I'm jocquoise, like organic certified tea salesman.
[01:40:28] Yep. Definitely. Who would have fought? Look, it's not about the organic. It's about having an
[01:40:35] 8,000 pound deadlift, which is 100% guaranteed. Double pine. Double pine pussy. They're tested.
[01:40:43] Get some. And by the way, all these items are available right now at the vitamin shop.

[01:43:20] to make some more of those in the very near future. War your kid podcast. That is the best podcast
[01:43:28] that a child could listen to. Am I biased? Maybe. Am I right? Absolutely. And don't forget about
[01:43:36] war your kid soap. And I am overjoyed doing for me that we have a new soap out from IrishOach Ranch.com.
[01:43:47] It's got anti bacterial anti microbial. Right.
[01:43:53] Colonial. Well, anyways, it's got really good stuff. If you're dirty, especially dirty
[01:44:01] in the tents of jujitsu, where you've got little creepy crawlies trying to get into your skin,
[01:44:08] then you can get something that we made young and it's called killer soap.
[01:44:14] Good IrishOach Ranch.com. So you can get yourself some killer soap and

[01:44:38] anyway, good stuff on there. I think enhanced stuff as well. You can see,
[01:44:45] jocko and his things are exploding. Things are catching on fire. Sometimes things are cracking open.
[01:44:55] Synchronization with my words. Yeah. And music. Chelos and whatnot. Yes. The last haven't
[01:45:02] heard echoes and enhanced videos. You may not know it. Echo is a chelo enthusiast. I, well,
[01:45:11] chelos, I replaced me one of his videos when the chelos kicks it. I didn't look.
[01:45:17] Anyway, videos on there. Yes. So you've got YouTube channel. Yeah. What's it called?
[01:45:22] Jocco podcast. Jocco podcast. What's it called? The thorn. We also have something called
[01:45:26] Psychological Warfare. And I got a great piece of information, a great suggestion from someone
[01:45:35] some trooper out there just made a great suggestion. This suggestion was when you talk about
[01:45:39] psychological warfare, you should describe it as a little psychological eater.
[01:45:48] Well, as soon as I said it, I was like, you get credit. Credit. So yes, if you need a little
[01:45:53] psychological eater to help you get over some moment of weakness, we'll guess what we got
[01:45:58] something for you. It's called Psychological Warfare. It's on iTunes, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.
[01:46:04] If you need a visual, hitter, then go to flipsidecampus.com where the code of my
[01:46:11] or speaking of is making visual representations of the path that you can hang on your wall on your
[01:46:19] ceiling in your doorway. Keep you on the path. That's what you need to do. Got some books,
[01:46:26] leadership strategy and tactics. The most recent, the answer to the answer to every leadership
[01:46:34] question that I've been asked on this podcast, that I get asked all the time. So leadership
[01:46:38] strategy and tactics field manual, everyone that got it, thank you, made it number one on a
[01:46:43] bunch of different lists, which was awesome. And I was super stoked. It was especially awesome.
[01:46:48] If you're in the literary ecosystem, then you go, oh, number one, everyone else doesn't care.
[01:46:54] So I'm kind of got one foot in that door because there's a bunch of people that I work with that
[01:46:59] in the literary world because that's what that's what it is, right? You write a book. You're in the
[01:47:04] literary world. Yes. So that ecosystem. So you guys even though none of you care,
[01:47:10] you all propelled me to the number one in that ecosystem that anyone that's outside of the
[01:47:16] literary world doesn't care about. People say, how do you stay humble? Guess what? No one cares
[01:47:24] about this stuff. That's how leadership strategy and tactics got a bunch of kids books,
[01:47:29] way the warrior kid, one, two and three, Mikey and the dragons for that little or kid,
[01:47:33] discipline equals freedom, field manual, which people just take pictures of that and just post,
[01:47:40] just a picture of the cover of the book, which I'm always like credit. So leadership strategy
[01:47:46] and tactics is field manual, too. The first field manual was just pointy because freedom, field manual.
[01:47:50] The audio version of that is on iTunes Amazon music, Google Play and other MP3 platforms. And then
[01:47:56] of course, it all started with extreme ownership and the dichotomy leadership, which I wrote with
[01:48:01] my brother, Lave Babin, about the lessons that we learned in combat and how you can use them in
[01:48:05] business and life. We got EF online, which is leadership training online and what this is is
[01:48:17] a supplement. Actually, it doesn't even have to be a supplement. It could be the whole meal.
[01:48:22] If this is what you can do, then you want leadership training, go to EF online. If you need it
[01:48:27] inside your company, inside your business, inside your team, you can contact echelon front.com.
[01:48:33] That's my leadership consultancy echelon front.com. What we do is solve problems through
[01:48:39] leadership. We got some musters coming up up. We got, well, all the ones that we've done
[01:48:47] I'm sold out. The ones that are coming up on deck are Orlando, Florida, Dallas, Texas,
[01:48:58] Phoenix Arizona and Phoenix Arizona. Go to extreme ownership.com for those, all the events that
[01:49:05] we've ever done have sold out. So if you want to come, go to extreme ownership.com early so that you can
[01:49:11] get some. And last thing we now have EF Overwatch and EF Legion. EF Overwatch aimed at
[01:49:18] executive leadership taking folks that were in the military leaders, senior leaders in the military
[01:49:24] and placing them into civilian companies so that they can help that company move forward.
[01:49:32] That's our executive leadership placement firm. We also have EF Legion, which is front-line
[01:49:39] troops and front-line leaders. So if you've been in the military, if you're a veteran and you want
[01:49:45] to find your next mission, if you're a senior leader, cool, go to EF Overwatch. If you're a junior
[01:49:49] leader, go to EF Legion and companies that are looking for junior leaders or executive leaders,
[01:49:55] you can do the same thing. EF Legion.com or EF Overwatch.com, these are people that understand
[01:50:01] the principles that we teach and kind of apply them inside your business. And if you have not heard
[01:50:09] enough of my exceedingly slow talking and ludicrously serious tone, and you haven't had enough
[01:50:21] of Echos marginally applicable metaphors. If you can't get enough of those two things,
[01:50:29] we'll guess what, you can get more. We are available on the inner webs on Twitter, Instagram,
[01:50:36] and on that Facebook. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and to final word here.
[01:50:48] Thank you all for listening to podcast. A podcast that exists thanks to your
[01:50:53] support. Thanks for listening, spreading the word, telling your friends,
[01:50:57] thanks for getting some deaf core or some origin gear, all of which support this podcast. And of
[01:51:02] course, thanks to all the service members out there in uniform who protect the very freedoms that
[01:51:07] make this podcast possible. Also to our police and law enforcement firefighters,
[01:51:13] paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service,
[01:51:19] all the first responders. And I saw a bunch of military members. I saw a bunch of first responders
[01:51:25] at all the Jocca lives and I appreciate you coming out. And I want to say thank you for providing
[01:51:30] an environment where we can live our lives as we see fit. And to everyone else out there,
[01:51:43] remember to tell yourself the truth. Remember to tell yourself the truth. You know what that means.
[01:51:52] The truth is you need to do more. The truth is you need to be more to reach your fullest
[01:52:04] maximum capacity and capability as a human being. And if you tell yourself that truth,
[01:52:13] you will find discipline. And if you find discipline, you will find freedom.
[01:52:26] So do not lie to yourself. And instead get out there and get after it.
[01:52:36] And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
