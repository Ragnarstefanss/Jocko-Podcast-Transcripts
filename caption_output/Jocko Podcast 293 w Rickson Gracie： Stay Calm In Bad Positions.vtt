00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 293 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm good evening. Hicks and Gracie approached me and asked me if I wanted to train with him.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.50
Yes, sir. At that time I was a blue belt in Gjitsu, a lean 225 pounds. I worked out every day

4
00:00:23.50 --> 00:00:29.000
and had been training Gjitsu hard for about two years. I had competed at the blue belt level

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and won many competitions. I trained daily in San Diego with Dean Lister, a future world champion,

6
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and with many other highly skilled Gjitsu practitioners. I was focused and motivated and determined.

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But none of those things mattered. Hicks and who was 40 pounds lighter than me made me feel like a child.

8
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He effortlessly controlled my movement, isolated my limbs and submitted me over and over again.

9
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I fought hard, applied technique, after technique made adjustments, tried to surprise him, used all the strength and trickery and skill and effort I could master.

10
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000
My resistance was futile. There was nothing I could do. Nothing.

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When he was bored with my pitiful attempts at survival, we stopped sparring and talked for a bit.

12
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He asked me about seal training. He related to the warrior culture of my occupation.

13
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000
He also gave me an assessment of my Gjitsu quote. You do a good job staying calm and bad positions.

14
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That is an important thing and quote. Soon the class was over. We shook hands and I thanked Hicks and for his time and for his knowledge.

15
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And over the next few days I thought about what he had told me.

16
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You do a good job staying calm and bad positions. That is an important thing.

17
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I realized that this did not only apply to Gjitsu. It applied to my job and the seal teams as well.

18
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You are going to get put in bad positions. The enemy might get the upper hand. You might be outnumbered or outgunned.

19
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Panic will destroy you. You have to stay calm.

20
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And that was only the beginning of the correlation I began to see from Gjitsu to combat to leadership to business and to life itself.

21
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
As I continued to learn Gjitsu and progress in my seal career, Gjitsu taught me much.

22
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But it was Hicks and words that initiated my journey.

23
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The principles of Gjitsu can be applied to every endeavor in life. You have to stay calm when you are in bad situations.

24
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You need to cover and conceal your intent with other maneuvers. You need to utilize the simplest and most efficient methods.

25
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You need to prioritize your focus of effort.

26
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.000
You need to train until you trust yourself to move intuitively without having to think. You need to move at the right time.

27
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
You need to defend critical areas.

28
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You should not attack your enemy's strong points. You must utilize leverage.

29
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You cannot let your emotions drive your decisions. You have to establish a good base foundation to build upon.

30
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You cannot be overly aggressive, but you can't just allow things to happen.

31
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
When you make a move, you have to believe in what you are doing.

32
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You have to be mentally strong. You have to keep an open mind. You have to continuously learn new techniques.

33
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
While always reinforcing the fundamentals.

34
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You have to adapt your plan if circumstances change. The list goes on and on.

35
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
When I deployed to Iraq as a seal combat leader, I continuously operated with these fundamental principles in my head.

36
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Once that I understood because of jujitsu. I continue to utilize these principles now in the civilian world as well as a businessman, a teacher, a father and a coach.

37
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Jujitsu gives me confidence, but also humility.

38
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Strength, but also compassion, a disciplined code, but also a free and open mind.

39
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
As Hickson says, jujitsu is not just a sport.

40
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Jujitsu is a philosophy and it is at the root of everything we do.

41
00:04:48.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And that right there is an excerpt from a forward written by me for a new book that is called,

42
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.000
brief, a life in flow. And is written by Brazilian jujitsu legend, Hickson Gracie.

43
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And it is an honor to have Hickson here with us tonight to share some of his stories, his philosophies of jujitsu and his lessons learned.

44
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Hickson, thank you so much for joining us. It is an honor to have you here.

45
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
My pleasure, Joko, and it is a great pleasure to see you guys. And first of all, I like to really thank you.

46
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And it is a honor for me to have you do the introduction in the book.

47
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It was a special compliment for me because you such a highly skilled motivation, warrior.

48
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And we follow your scenes. That is kind of established, very high.

49
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And for my journey, so I appreciate your support, my brother.

50
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Yeah, I've often talked about the fact of what jujitsu gave to me.

51
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And what jujitsu gave to me was connecting all these things.

52
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I started to see jujitsu everywhere and everything became related to jujitsu.

53
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And really it was in, I think it was 1996 or 1997 when I went up.

54
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And I stayed in a crappy hotel up in Los Angeles for like, like, 10 days or something.

55
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And I went to Pico, your academy at Pico every day.

56
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And just was absorbing.

57
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I'm still so far from those sessions.

58
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I have good memories.

59
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
People ask me what it's like, what it was like to train with you.

60
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And I said, I've told people if you've ever felt the pressure of a high-powered hose,

61
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
like a high-powered hose just water just bearing down on you.

62
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And when you move a little bit, it doesn't matter.

63
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It just flows around you.

64
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That's what it felt like when you were not was rolling with you.

65
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I everything that I tried, you were already there waiting for me.

66
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And the pressure and the tightness but at the same time, the fluidity, it's hard to describe.

67
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Yes, jujitsu is a very special technique because

68
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
give you the sense of utilizing your body,

69
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but not exactly trying to stress yourself.

70
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's a continuous motion with leverage and angles and the ability for you to bring based on weight distribution

71
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and different grips and maneuvers.

72
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The chance for you to flow into harmonious control because it's not about holding and fighting for,

73
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but it's about understanding the motions and be ahead of the game.

74
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So when you escape from the neck, you already give me the arm and the idea for the one who's suffering,

75
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the attack, the pressure is no relief until you tap.

76
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But for me, it was just a continuous understanding of what's next and the ability to move and to make it be there in the right precision time.

77
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So it's a very interesting technique and give me the chance for really use not only my techniques,

78
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
not only my physicality, but also my mindset and my emotional control.

79
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And also what I believe is a very important tool for the spirit or water is using the spirit or energy from forgiveness and acceptance and not fear death.

80
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And accepting the circumstances in a way to be like you said, comfortable to brain health.

81
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So as many things which you should favor you to accept life as it is and transform the battle and a ground and a growing situation for your mind and your spirit.

82
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, you should be as great as you are.

83
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You're component for anyone. Yeah, I, I try and explain to people sometimes that when you do digits or the more digits or you do,

84
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
you get to a point where you can kind to see the future because you know what this other person's going to do and when you know what they're going to do,

85
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you're can be their waiting for them because you know what they're going to do.

86
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And it's the same thing with any thing that you practice and you train and you pay attention to,

87
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
you can get to a point where you can kind of predict the future. And I think some people say, you know,

88
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
you're a couple moves ahead in digits and the better you get, the more moves ahead you're going to be.

89
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Yes, similar to chess, chess game, you know,

90
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000
if you play a guy who's a champion, he's already know what you're going to, when you move a piece, he knows five or ten movements ahead and he's already to

91
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000
strategize your defeat. So I felt like the same as you did so you cannot dissipate the motions based on the mechanics and the,

92
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and the tension and so you can capitalize basically always in some kind of mistake or some kind of lack of time or something like that.

93
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So you wrote this book.

94
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I was lucky enough like honored to be able to write the forward, but that also meant I got to read the book early and I have a copy of it here.

95
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And just want to kind of jump into some of the book and talk about how you grew up, which is, I mean, it's just an incredible,

96
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
your journey is been incredible, your whole family's had such a huge impact on the world.

97
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And it's very interesting to kind of hear what it was like for you and growing up inside this such an influential family.

98
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So let's jump into the book a little bit.

99
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Here we go. By the time I was born, my father was already one of Brazil's biggest sports icons.

100
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000
In addition to being incredibly tough fighter, he was also a showman of the highest order who publicly challenged boxing icons,

101
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Primo Carneira, Joe Lewis and Ezra Charles.

102
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Although the boxers all declined in 1932, wrestler Fred Erberg, Ebert, accepted 17-year-old Aliose challenged.

103
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Aliose your father. Ebert outweighed him by about 50 pounds, but they fought for an hour and 40 minutes before police stop the fight.

104
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Two years later, my dad fought 225 pound world champion wrestler Vodic Zabisco to a draw.

105
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:59.000
When Japan's greatest judoka, Masahiko Kamira traveled to Brazil in 1951, Aliose also challenged him.

106
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Kamira agreed to fight my dad if he could first defeat Yukio Kato, one of the black belt traveling with him.

107
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:16.000
My dad's first fight with Kato was declared a jaw, but Aliose choked him unconscious in the rematch clearing the way for a match with the judo champion.

108
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Aliose and Kamira squared off in front of 20,000 spectators a week later, and even the president of Brazil attended the match.

109
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:46.000
But could not finish him. At one point, my dad went unconscious, but because he didn't tap, Kamira fought the choke wasn't working and released it, and Aliose regained consciousness.

110
00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:01.000
In my dad refused to tap, Kamira kept twisting and ripping at his shoulder, still Aliose refused to tap, but Kamira kept cranking, and my uncle Carlos threw in the towel.

111
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And named the Ben Armlock, the Kamira. So there's your dad. How much your dad weigh? 140 pounds? 135, yeah. Was a light guy.

112
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And going up against Kamira, who's a beast, and by the way, you can see at least parts of this match online, you can go and Google and see this match.

113
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Yes, Kimura was the champion in Japan, which is very unusual for a champion in Japan to become five years consecutive champion, normally every six months they trade places.

114
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
But Kimura was established in a true champion in the Japanese community.

115
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And when he went to Brazil, my father challenged him and then he fought Kato first, and the fight with Kimura, Kimura put in the newspaper.

116
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:02.000
If he passed three minutes, he was already winning the fight, like if he very survives three minutes, he wins.

117
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And the fight went to 13 minutes, and one point the whole crowd saying, oh, he's done, he's done, stopped the fight, he's already won.

118
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But the fight continues and my father's back, he gets to meet with Kimura.

119
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And even though after that fight, Kimura went to my father's house with a translator, inviting him to teach in the Imperial School in Japan, because he said, the Jujitsu, he knows Japan has forgotten.

120
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And I don't believe he's like that, exactly, because a big part of the Brazilian Jujitsu was created by my father, exactly because my uncle Carlos learned from Kondikoma.

121
00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And my father was a champion, he's been fighting for all over and went to Brazil to settle. And he started teaching Uncle Carlos based on the friendship he has with my grandfather.

122
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And in that process, Uncle Carlos learned a lot from my grandfather, but my uncle was 12 years younger than my uncle.

123
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And he was very young kid at this time. And then they went to Rio in 1925, Seru in Rio.

124
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And my uncle Carlos opened his first school in 1925. At this point, my father was, could not do any sports. He was doctor said for him, should not do anything, not playing soccer, not write a bike, not skate nothing.

125
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Because he's very skinny and he has a vertical all the time, so he's passed out any effort, he's passing out. So he has to rest.

126
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So my uncle opened his school, my father's sitting on the corner all the time watching my uncle teach. And for three years from 13 years old to 16, he was just watching.

127
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I may is watching all the day, the day is all the, the say is all the moves, but he never practiced. And one day, I student arrived at the school and my uncle was not there yet.

128
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So my father said, Mr, if you want to do, let's play a little bit to my brother arrived. So with that, they start to practice, half our later my uncle arrived.

129
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And the student said, Carlos, if you don't mind, I like to keep training with the kid because he's so good, I love to practice with him.

130
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So in that's the way my father gets into jujitsu practice, but different than a normal person, my father could not do one pull up, one pull up, or one push up, he don't have the strength in the muscles to do that.

131
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So he basically, I choke for example, which is a, he learned as our movement, where you grab the colors and squeeze the guy to choke, he could not even think about choke somebody with the strength on his arms.

132
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So he has to bring together and use the chest, which transforms the whole pressure on the choke, giving last effort musculerly and much more efficiency technically.

133
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So just a very simple example of how my dad, in every movement he could do, he had that for him, for his own weakness.

134
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And his another very important element is he was so light and so small, he could not ever fight on top, mount positions, passing guards and kick-ups from the top.

135
00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So he was able to just stay on the bottom, regardless, and he was able to create from the guard position, I, I knew our scenario of tricks because he has nothing to do but guard.

136
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:19.000
So he developed a guard and a very, very, very aggressive style and a Brazilian style which doesn't belong to Japan at all, all the ground techniques from the bottom are developed by my father, which as weak enough to not do other things.

137
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So he's improved, we normally say in the family, all your grace is for you, as Einstein is to physics. He's a creator, he's a genius, he's impossible to compare.

138
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And follow this, this idea of, of, of, total connection with the techniques and the development, the jujitsu, the Brazilian jujitsu becomes more like effective and the valetudo and the no-hots bar and effectiveness overall with gear without gear, because gives to the weaker one elements to, to submit the bigger one.

139
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So I felt like jujitsu really becomes, of, art for a weaker one after past through, through Brazil. Before, conjicoma, conjima Idae coma was a very effective, he has many, many victories, but he was a stock guy, he was solid, strong Japanese, not to at all, but it's very solid, maybe 80 kilos or 85 kilos or something.

140
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So he was, he was, he's his own form of artleticism, which is different than what my dad implies. So we are very grateful to have very grace in the family, to bring another possibilities for our style.

141
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Yeah, that's, it seems like in jujitsu, when, when you have jujitsu like that, it's the situation where like you said somebody that's smaller and weaker can defeat someone that's bigger and stronger.

142
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:11.000
But he, that starts jujitsu for the first time, when I started jujitsu for the first time, you know, I was, like I said, I was 220 pounds, my first teacher was Fabio Santos. I think he weighs, I don't know, 150, 160 pounds.

143
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:24.000
He would just do whatever he wanted to me and he was an old man at the time. He was probably younger than I am right now, he seemed like he was no man, I said, I was this old man with gray hair, going to do anything to me.

144
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:45.000
So he was too allows you to do that. Jujitsu is, you know, what, what your dad, because he had, like you said, because he was smaller, because he was weaker, he had to develop that style and it's so effective. Yes, leverage replaces strength, you know, techniques replaces speed.

145
00:20:45.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So when you have the perfect combination, you can anticipate the movement, you can use time, your favorite and other deflection. So it's a very interesting concept of winning without really banging heads to head, you have to make, like set him up or fake or set up in a way to, to almost surprise the guy with and defeat, not exactly smash him, you know, it's too brutal sometimes, it's too much.

146
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Too much to boost fighting, you know, I love to see the, the articulation of a technician suppresses the strength. So for me, I always amaze about the effectiveness of, and the possibilities of Jujitsu.

147
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit and just so everybody knows, I already skipped a bunch of the book, you know, you talk about the originations of the family. It's very interesting, you know, you came from, you had a great, what was a great, great, great grandfather that that was in the civil war on the confederate side. Yes.

148
00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And the family is in the war fair for a long time. Yeah, you mentioned, what was it, archa bald, this guy archa bald Gracie and archa bald Gracie, archa brawl of the third was a warrior, West Point, he earned superintendant Robert Lee's respect after he got beaten up in a fight on the parade grounds when Gracie was called in the Lee's office, he refused to give up the name of the man he was fighting after his opponent turned himself in, leaded not punish either of them.

149
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:33.000
When America's civil war broke out, archa bald Gracie, the third sighted with the confederacy, he started the war as a major, but after fighting heroically in some of the conflicts, fiercest battles Gracie was a brigadier general at the age of 29.

150
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Robert Lee survived the civil war, but archa bald Gracie the third did not.

151
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Yeah, so that's the side that went to America. Yes. I didn't know much about it, and two Peter which wrote the book, we made. Yeah, he's a historian and war, military professor, so he enlightened me with that kind of interesting story.

152
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Yeah, I actually looked up on the internet and saw a picture of archa bald Gracie, the third dressed up and his confederate uniform. So crazy.

153
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Yeah, you go into some more of those details which you kind of discussed about the history of how it came from Japan to Brazil, how your uncle got involved, how your brother got involved, how those details are so rich in the book.

154
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So fascinating to read from a geetic perspective, but also just from a historical perspective in the world. I'm a fast forward a little bit.

155
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
So what it was like for you growing up, you say initially, we kids went to the academy just to play tug of war, have a game of soccer.

156
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
We were introduced to geetic slowly, nothing like what I see these days.

157
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Today, too many parents push their kids to compete before they're ready for young kids. Juditude should be nothing more than a fun form of recreation that introduces them to the movements through games and structured play.

158
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
As they get older, you can introduce more jutsu, but it should be playful.

159
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
If you push kids too hard too young, they will quit forever.

160
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Children should never burden their kids with their unfulfilled ambitions for stations, anxiety or any other form of emotional baggage. Parents support the parents support must be consistent.

161
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.000
The most important thing is that the child gets the experience when lose or draw without judgment.

162
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
So this is something a lot of parents need to hear. This is something I wish I would have heard earlier.

163
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I was telling you before we started, I definitely pushed my kids too hard in the jujitsu.

164
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Maybe that was my unfulfilled ambitions that I tried to impose on my own children.

165
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And I read a book later in life.

166
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And it talked about how you want to make things fun for your kids.

167
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
It sounds like for you guys at the beginning, the jujitsu was just fun.

168
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Yes, because you know, it's a must for us. We no matter what we represent them.

169
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I mean, we are graces. We all dress geese from, I mean, I get my my give before my diapers.

170
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So we all become little graces and our identity is recognized by, oh, you're going to be a champion.

171
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000
You're going to fight like that. So you, you, is a natural for you using geet training, sparring is all fun.

172
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
And I never felt like it was a serious business, even competing because my dad didn't put me pressure.

173
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
He always liked my first competition. He said to me, if he asked me if I want to compete, I said yes.

174
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And then he said, if you win, I give you a gift. If you lose, I give you two gifts.

175
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So that's kind of in between lines say, my dad's not going to be upset with me if I lose.

176
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000
So I didn't know what's really represented that kind of statement, but I felt like my dad is not going to be upset.

177
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000
So that's a plus. And I lose that fight. And I don't even remember if I get to two gifts or not.

178
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
But what I felt from that situation is my dad was not upset.

179
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
It's okay. And after that, I keep continuing competing. I was successful in my other fighters fights.

180
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:26.000
But was a good support of my dad and no pressure, make me feel like jiu jitsu is something for me to practice regardless of somebody else's judgment.

181
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:36.000
You go on to say this, you say, even as a small boy, I silently observed from close proximity, fear, courage, aggression and cowardice.

182
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I noticed small things about people because they provided clues about their true nature.

183
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Things as simple as the way someone shook my hand, the way people acted when they won, and the way they acted when they lost, told me a lot.

184
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
I often wondered why a guy who beat me so mercilessly made excuses not to train with my older brothers.

185
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I didn't judge them. I just knew that I didn't want to be like them.

186
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
There's a lot of human nature that gets revealed on the jiu jitsu mats.

187
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Oh, no doubt about it, man. I was young and I would start teaching helping my brother, who I didn't teach private lessons.

188
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
I was 13, 14 years old and I was there like a dummy. You know, so he's only down. John Mountain just to practice movements.

189
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
So I was helping him to teach.

190
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And I got a little tip after the class. He gave me some ice cream or some, so I was there to just watch him teaching and helping.

191
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
And then I asked my dad, said, Dad, what I should do to be the best teacher.

192
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:49.000
And then he said to me, if you want to be a good teacher, you learn a good armlock, a good escape from the bottom, whatever.

193
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
And teach your student and he will be efficient on do the technique.

194
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
What if you want to be an excellent student, you have to see, you have to try to understand what the students need to learn.

195
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So he's not about what I want to teach, he's about what he needs to learn.

196
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
So based on that, another route was created because I cannot just be a jiu jitsu teacher.

197
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I have to be a psychologist and understand what I need to teach to make happens to make the guy seeking happiness more efficiently.

198
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:32.000
So I student with stance and claustrophobic, I teach him like to become and relax and do the movements almost in slow motion.

199
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.000
For the guy who stands and try to be tough and aggressive and so I come down and relax.

200
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
So the other guys are lazy.

201
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Come up, come up, come up. So I bring the energy needs to be naturally on him. So becomes a half psychology, half jiu jitsu class.

202
00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And that's was a big transformation for me because I start to understand my service as something to enhance people's lives, qualities of life.

203
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
You know, he's not about being just a martial arts or a teacher to fight.

204
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
I have to teach you to breathe, I have to teach you to strategize, I have to teach you to have emotional control.

205
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:25.000
I have to teach you to visual make his own decisions, I have to teach you to not only using the technical elements but also the spirit of elements.

206
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I have to teach you to have hope, faith and things like that.

207
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:40.000
So another for you to become a expert in jiu jitsu is you basically becomes a expert in life too because you know how to put yourself.

208
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And situations and be able to recognize the situation and see if you need a better calmness in your brain, a better control in your body.

209
00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Or if you have to really surrender to a higher God and put because in one point we cannot have be afraid of death.

210
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:19.000
You know, and if you able to understand your mission, your commitment, your honor, are above that kind of that line, you become a fearless opponent because you're not afraid to die at all.

211
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:34.000
How a Navy seal can go to battle not visualizing the possibility to die. How a fireman can save a kid from a structure without the sliced chance of him to die in fall with.

212
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:48.000
So once you become comfortable and the acceptance of the result you're not in control, you become a much more complete, not warrior because you just find your mission as a priority, not exactly.

213
00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:01.000
So in representing jiu jitsu was a big thing for me which transcends my life, my my physicality was something I put my honor and my faith on top of everything.

214
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:16.000
So I was able to accept in challenge and be ready for challenge which different than a soldier representing an army which you have commands you have.

215
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Weaponry you have strategies you have situations which are not exactly up to you for me by representing my sport.

216
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I was preparing myself for no no time limits, no rules, no cups, no mount pieces, no no weight division.

217
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:53.000
So how unpredictable this can be, how much I have to be on my toes, how much I have to accept my final moment, how much I have to be, come in the day before and order to achieve my success.

218
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:06.000
So it's a lot of complex, a lot of aspects of my life, not only the technical, not only the spirit or not only the map, I have to be checking every day and being calm enough.

219
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:18.000
So that's why in my career I was putting a lot of tension and my breathing, I put a lot of tension and take nice baths before anyone tell me about it.

220
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I started creating situations which kind of put myself on the edge and being fearless, being connected with my spirit or guidance and accepting anything even death if it was the case.

221
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:47.000
So I was preparing myself to be a warrior but without the command, without the force behind me was just like, I have to create a lot of things to deal with the pressure.

222
00:32:47.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And I felt like today, I'm not as usual, so fighting anymore, I have many injuries, but I still in my mind, sharp as always, using all my invisible tools in your jutsu to keep me on my best game in terms of using timing, using visualization, using breathing, using the capacity for me to emotional control and the capacity to surrender to the body.

223
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And I'm not that important, thank you all my war fairs, all my situations.

224
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I don't, I don't resolve with hate. I love to fight, I love to use jutsu, I love to represent, I love to put myself on the edge.

225
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I love was a big, important part of my history because I never been ordered to do something, I never been obeying people to do something. I always, I free will.

226
00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I put myself in the situations I, I'm not regret but I was tough situations to be in, based on my own passion, based on my own love. So I be in a warrior which being guided by the heart, not by the rationality.

227
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And this is kind of a little different.

228
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Yeah, it's interesting, it's different. One of the things you said, and again, there's so many connections that I make with jutsu with battle, with life, with relationships, with everything.

229
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And just one little example you said, there's sometimes in jutsu, you've got to calm down, you've got to remain calm, you've got to put in a bad spot, you've got to calm, you've got to relax, you've got to not panic, you've got to think your way through it, you've got to wait for your moment.

230
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
There's other times in jutsu where if you don't explode and make a move right now, it's going to be too late.

231
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Yes. And you have to, and it's the same thing, and you know if you're, if you're in a business, you might have a situation where you've got to calm down, you've got to make a decision, you've got to think through it.

232
00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:02.000
But there's other times where you've got to make a move right now, on the battlefield, same thing, sometimes something start to happen, you're starting to see the enemy do something, and you need to wait and become and relax and detach and not get emotional.

233
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:15.000
There's other times, something happens, you've got to go right now and jutsu, you start to identify that look, there's times where you've got to take a step back relax, you've got to be calm, and there's other times where you've got to be aggressive, you've got to make things happen right now.

234
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And those type of lessons that again, I learned them, I learned them a little bit from my seal training, I learned them a little bit interacting with my, from a leadership perspective.

235
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:40.000
But when I really started to see it, when I, when I started to change jutsu all the time and started recognizing, oh, sometimes you've got to become, sometimes you've got to be aggressive, sometimes you've got to be flexible, sometimes you've got to be strong in that position.

236
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And you've got to be no when to make these adjustments in your life.

237
00:35:45.000 --> 00:36:13.000
I feel like with the practice of jutsu, like you said, give you more awareness of the situation to be in, and the sense of applying the right action for the situation is based on reflexes, is based on practice, is based on preparation.

238
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Which sometimes that preparation comes from understanding, strategic one understanding, sometimes that preparation coming from a heavy training, a heavy muscular and explosive training.

239
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Or sometimes the preparation coming from a completely emotional control. I was kid about 12, 13 years old, practice with men's at the academy. After the class everybody training a little bit together.

240
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
And they all take care of me, I was a kid still and training with adults.

241
00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:13.000
And in one particular practice this strong guy, Blue Belt, gave me a headlock. And I was caught in a headlock, I was not able to escape. I was not able to be comfortable and normally we don't tap in our headlocks because you can keep him, keep breathing.

242
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000
But I was a good guy, and I was like, I was like, I'm okay, thank you.

243
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
So I was pissed and I went back home.

244
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:46.000
And when I arrived, I decided to lay down on the floor on top of a carpet and ask my brother, I kind of stayed like straight like this, and ask my brother to roll me in the carpet like a burrito.

245
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And it was like a summer time in Brazil about 110 human, very hot. And I said, just take me from here and 10 minutes.

246
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So first minute was struggling, cost for fobic, and I started thinking about seagulls and breeze on the ocean and ocean breeze and the nice wind.

247
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Eventually passed through the experience, my brother relieved me. And then in the same year I did three more times, just to make sure I could handle that kind of suffocating agony and claustrophobic feeling.

248
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So that's just to show how competitive I was and how much on top of my problems, I was fixing my problems as the problems happened.

249
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:45.000
And I was just comfortable and become, you know, agonizing and breeding suffocating and then I started to become and find myself in peace.

250
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And then I felt like, this is not going to happen with me anymore. I never going to tap and head locks anymore because was just the way I felt like I was fixing my emotional.

251
00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Yeah, that's, you're confronting your weaknesses, what you're doing. I remember when I started GG2, I hated being on the bottom because I was bigger.

252
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And if I could get on top of someone, I could smash him and be okay. And I hated being on the bottom. And for that reason, I remember one time for it.

253
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:30.000
I was supposed to be in a year every, every time I rolled with anybody, I started on the bottom and oftentimes with them across side or maybe even mount just to get used to that and get over the fact that I didn't like it.

254
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
You have to con, in GG2, just like life, you got to face your weaknesses and you got to correct them.

255
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Yes, definitely.

256
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Now you mentioned your, your brother holes. I want to give just a little bit of background of your family, which is hard to give a quick background of your family.

257
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Yeah, so many, it's crazy. It's huge.

258
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
You have this section here.

259
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Carlos Gracie, this is your uncle, decided to, this is, so he lost two loves of his life. He lost his fiance and was his fiance in his first wife.

260
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Is that right? Yes. They both died. So after they died, Carlos Gracie decided to father as many children, preferably boys as possible and he encouraged my father to do the same.

261
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:28.000
There goes to create a clan of fighters between 1932 and 1967, Carlos and Alio, fathered 30 children with eight different women, 20 one of them were boys.

262
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:41.000
When Margarita, my, my father's first wife, the woman I consider my mother was unable to get pregnant, my uncle came up with a plan. My father, with my mother's knowledge and consent, would impregnate our African Brazilian babysitter,

263
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Baleena, my son, Baleena, yes, Baleena, who gave birth to me to me and my older brothers, Hory and and Helsen.

264
00:40:49.000 --> 00:41:01.000
The whole thing was in a lab at Rousse, Margarita wore a fake belly during Baleena's pregnancies and when the time came for her to give birth, she went to the hospital and came home with a baby, not even her best friends knew.

265
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:11.000
When I was young, I looked at myself in the mirror and saw freckles. I thought they were from my Scottish blood. Little did I know I was half African Brazilian.

266
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Then that's a crazy story. Yes, man. That's part of the, the, the, the Gracie,

267
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:25.000
the fanatic idea of growing jujuts and creating a clan, you know, was just epic.

268
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So with that, let me, let me go a little bit for this. Now you got all these brothers. I go back to book. I, this is fast-forward a little bit.

269
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:43.000
I studied all my brothers with great interest when we trained because they had different strengths and weaknesses. I want to know who is brave, who is scared, who would fight to the death, who is crazy, who is indecisive.

270
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Nobody impressed me more than my brother-holes. A decade older than me, he was our leader and my idol because he was an incredibly charismatic person and a natural warrior.

271
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Holes was Uncle Carlos's son from Claudia, an 18-year-old woman who worked for my family because my mother Margarita could not have children.

272
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Uncle Carlos gave holes to my dad to raise as his own son when he was a baby.

273
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Holes grew up with us and shared a room with me from much of my childhood. And this is what's interesting when you talk about holes fast-forward a little bit.

274
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:25.000
My brothers opened mind helped him in jujitsu because he was willing to look outside of it for ideas when other family members were not.

275
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Holes trained and competed in judo, wrestling and sombo which he used to improve jujitsu. Like Alio, he always wanted to win by submission and had an aggressive attacking style.

276
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
If I disappointed, the holes there was nothing that I was not willing to do to redeem myself.

277
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:54.000
That holes with that attitude that opened mind where he was doing sombo and wrestling. I mean that's a game changer.

278
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Completely, he was just such a brave fighter and warrior and competitive and if I could open mind to understand. Jujitsu is great, but doesn't have the ability to throw as a judo.

279
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Doesn't have the ability to get some other situations like wrestling, some maneuvers from bottom to the top, some reverses. So adding this, we're not going to hurt nobody.

280
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:32.000
It's just going to add for us the capabilities of not only controlling better from the top, throwing better from the outstanding aspect.

281
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:45.000
And also, we do what we do, good in terms of jujitsu. So it was just a complete improvement in our capacity to handle the athletes all over.

282
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:54.000
So it was just a great addition. And for me, Holes, always being the number one guy who pushed me the most, different than Hordeon, which is very technical.

283
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:03.000
But Hordeon was less competitive. So when I was very competitive, so I was seeking to do what Holes does.

284
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000
You mentioned Hordeon here a little bit. Nine years older than me, my brother Horyon could not have been more different than Holes.

285
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Ali was first son with our birth mother, Balinda. Horyon was ten months younger than Holes. Horyon had an easygoing nature.

286
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And while he was never the fighter that Holes was, he was a born teacher.

287
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Training with Horyon included the theory behind such concepts as positioning technique, leverage and base. He explained jujitsu much better than Holes, who was inpatient and saw things as either block or white.

288
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.000
He had a big influence on my teaching style and got me to focus as much on the person as the techniques.

289
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Our father taught us that a good teacher taught the techniques well, but that a great teacher taught what in the each individual student needed to learn in strife or in life.

290
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Horyon was a great teacher. Eight years older than me, this is another brother. Holes and might have been the best fighter in the family if he wasn't such a wild man.

291
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Holes and would show up at a tournament having had no sleep still hung over from a night on the town, but when he put his on his gui and tight his belt, he turned into a Tasmanian devil.

292
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Holes and would fight all day, almost die, but win.

293
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:18.000
This is a fast forward a little bit, just a little glimpse into what it's light being in the family.

294
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
A Leo encouraged competition among us and always wanted to see who stood where in the Gracie food chain.

295
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:33.000
There were confrontations in test. My dad would step on the canvas, tarp, clap his hands and say, okay, Horyon, Holes, go.

296
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And without hesitation, they would step forward and spar. Holes and Horyon had totally different attitudes toward life, which were reflected in their jiu-jitsu.

297
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:47.000
There was never any question that Holes was the best of our generation.

298
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Now, you get this sort of side of the martial arts family growing up training all the time,

299
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:05.000
but you're also in Rio, which is a crazy place and the lifestyle that you had going on there, which you talk about here going to the book,

300
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Rio is like New York City in Bangkok combined.

301
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:18.000
It is a turbulent, whatever you want, whenever you want it, mix of sex, crime, drugs, nature and beach culture.

302
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Although we lived in a nice apartment in Copa, Cabana, Rio is not like LA. There's not a rich town like Beverly Hills and then a poor one like Compton.

303
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
They are combined. One minute you're in Beverly Hills and the next you turn down a side street and you are in Compton.

304
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:42.000
As a kid, I developed street smarts from gang bangers to fighters to the high society matrons to the surfers to the most beautiful girls in Ipanema.

305
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I wanted to understand all of it. I would often ditch school and just walk around Rio. I had normal rounds that I made through the city.

306
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
So you're kind of living this crazy, turbulent, turbulent lifestyle.

307
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
And you're just drawn to that.

308
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Very much because in my house, I was the youngster and the Holes, Hordeon and Hels, was eight, nine and ten years older than me.

309
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:19.000
So when I bought the 11 to 12, I'd like to hear what they say to keep up with, you know. So for me, when I go home, I was listening and learning with those smart guys, you know.

310
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And when I go to the street, I don't want to stay with the ten, eleven year olds, which are just thinking about silly things.

311
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
I was just to walk with older guys, talking about things I hear my brother stalk.

312
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:45.000
And the guy said, hey, this kid is not, he's not the one he's saying. So I was trying to be very, you know, compatible with the higher level street guys.

313
00:47:45.000 --> 00:48:01.000
I said, I see on the street. So that's kind of poomin and I'm a very soft place because I have to be smart.

314
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:14.000
I have to be very much solid with them, show no fear, show, so to be able to walk with them, to be able to get in the car and go some surf somewhere.

315
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:22.000
So I was there to just show them I can handle, you know. So I was just, give me a mission I will do, you know.

316
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Sometimes the guys, they want to smoke pot, for example, and nobody wants to go in the dealerspot because they all want to afraid of the cops.

317
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:38.000
I was 12, 11. I said, I can go with my trunks, I can go up and down, hide the thing and nobody going to see it.

318
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:49.000
So I was just being like the kid, which helps the older guys to get what they, so I was just doing things regardless of right or wrong.

319
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I just try to keep myself in a position to be respected from the boys on the hood, you know.

320
00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:05.000
And being like, I street guy, not exactly a spoiled kid, which forbidden to play on the street or something.

321
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:13.000
So I was just taking care of my life as I was 18, 19 and I was just 12, you know.

322
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:24.000
And you ended up kind of running with a gang of kids. Oh yeah, I mean, for me was a demonstration of courage, demonstration of being tough.

323
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:37.000
You know, it was not about doing right or wrong. It's about being able to keep with the boys and be respected and the hood as a guy who can not go to flick, you know, not going to.

324
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:52.000
So that's kind of give me a good sense of be part of a team, which is a tough team. The guys, they all fighters, they all tough kids, they all, you know, very, very much.

325
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Born to just do trouble and things.

326
00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000
And I was starting to grow in up a little bit. I started to see all those values I learned on the street.

327
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:24.000
I should not value, I should take in my life as if I want to grow up and represent what I want. So my mission, my passion for the family was take me away from that dark side of being just doing problems and start to become more an athlete and becoming completely focus on my life as a representative of Jiu Jitsu.

328
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:44.000
But we for sense of base and sense of, you know, I, I'm not going to let my friends down. I'm always good to be a solid, you know, no matter if it's going, you know, if it's a good thing, if it's a wrong thing, I want to be part of and be trusted by my friends. So that's what I accomplish.

329
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Yeah, it seems like you, you, you've ventured into that world of sort of that gang mentality and then you say here in the book, I began to drift away from the gang when members started stealing stereos and using guns.

330
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:06.000
I knew they were on a path that would take them nowhere fast and I was much more interested in Jiu Jitsu surfing and girls that life for crime.

331
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Although I was rebellious and did things that my dad didn't agree with, I never stopped competing and never stopped winning in his eyes that made me special. It was about this time that I began to train with my brother holes up to this point, Alio was my teacher.

332
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Whether he was surfing, training, fighting, writing horses, hand gliding or chasing girls, holes was constantly in motion. He was fast, technical, and always pushed me to train, harder and achieve more.

333
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Training with holes was essentially fighting. He reinforced what Alio had taught me. Fuck points, fuck judges, win by submission or not at all. I began to improve quickly under holes and Alio was not surprised.

334
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:59.000
I wasn't stubborn and never choked under pressure. Now the expectations for me were both from holes and my dad and they were extremely high.

335
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000
How many hours a day were you training with holes at this time?

336
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:14.000
At least four hours. At least two hours in the morning or early afternoon for classes and then at the training at night.

337
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
So I was always at the school. I was never been too much a good student.

338
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:30.000
So I get any excuse to stay away from school and stay at the academy or at the beach. But you know, was a good training very fun.

339
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:38.000
How much time would you spend sparring? How much time would you spend drilling? How much time would you spend creating new stuff?

340
00:52:38.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Normally the class follows up with a sequence of drilling, learning some techniques, some drills, and after the free sparring. So I follow the protocols of the class and I always going to learn something, training something or grabbing some kind of technique and also the practice afterwards. So I just follow the program of every class.

341
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Did you find yourself and holes, especially as holes is bringing in sombo and wrestling? Would you have to break stuff down and kind of adapt it into the jujitsu? Do you remember doing that kind of thing?

342
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I remember holding the techniques and we immediately because he also have the eye for what's good for us or not. I always not learning from my wrestling teacher.

343
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:40.000
I was teaching. I was learning from a guy who learns wrestling but is a jujitsu teacher and try to favor us with the best of it. So things he made learned and he didn't like it. He not even show us.

344
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:50.000
He just showed the things we are related to. I grabbed you here on the show. You do that. So I was just follow up his lead on what I should use from wrestling.

345
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:59.000
What I should use from sambo. What I should use from judo. Some techniques in judo are suicidal techniques and pull you after the throw.

346
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:06.000
You get caught in a bad position. So you don't want to do those techniques so basically I was not that you learned judo.

347
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I was that you learning. I efficient way to take people down with judo but for jujitsu.

348
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:19.000
So it was that all the preparation the techniques are kind of slightly different than being a just judo practitioner.

349
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:28.000
I was lucky. My son when he wrestled he had a wrestling coach that started working with his wrestling team. That was a jujitsu guy too.

350
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:38.000
And so he could tell him, hey, do this. Like hey, this is like a sweep. This is like a scissors sweep. He would be able to coach him to wrestle using jujitsu with wrestling.

351
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:55.000
You can relate much better. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. And you're surfing all the time at this point too. Yes. Yes. You're going to some pretty good details there about some of the some of the experiences you had surfing pushing yourself a little hard sometimes.

352
00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:08.000
You can some risks that maybe you shouldn't take it in the water. Yes. Because for me surfing was not exactly just the practice of the ability to go down in the wave and carve and do this snaps or whatever.

353
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Surf for me has to do with nature with the power of the ocean. So sometimes when the waves are too big. First thing to do is get afraid because you don't know what's going to happen if you get power. So dealing with this fear knowing and strategizing the best way to go in and out of the surf.

354
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:46.000
When you get the wave the timing of the wave. So it's a lot of things which has to keep you in control of the situation not only the ability to surf but to to stay calm to to paddle in the right direction to understand nature the wind the the the the rib currents.

355
00:55:46.000 --> 00:56:00.000
So is a is a lot of things to learn and to be comfort the point sometimes in a very comfortable situation so the ocean plays a very important teacher for me because you cannot fight nature.

356
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:15.000
You have to understand nature and deal with in the best way possible. So that's surf it was a very important for me in terms of the reading the ocean and stay connected with the ocean and a more and the the most deepest.

357
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:22.000
The most deepest way I could possibly do and surf was just a bonus.

358
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I guess it's the same thing with with opponents right because of opponent has some really good move that they're really strong at.

359
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:41.000
What's the point in fighting that move that they're really good at go go at them from some different direction of course the perfect strategy is work.

360
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:57.000
You're strengths on his weakness. So when you feel like you're losing the perfect aim about where he weakness is you have to shift not just try to force the wrong entrance but find another way to to get the whole you know.

361
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:06.000
So that's the idea of you, she's just capitalizing on your opponents mistakes and be aware of if he changes you have to flow and change again and again.

362
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:20.000
No expectations you may be expect a choke but it's going to arm locks going to happen. So everything can be unpredictable if you do right.

363
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit to this section here by the time I was a brown belt my matches with my brother holes were getting closer.

364
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I was beginning to understand the limitations of his game holes had an excellent neon belly move that he used to set up arm locks and he was lethal if he got your back.

365
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
But he was also predictably aggressive.

366
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:48.000
In our final 10 training sessions not only did holes not submit me but I was getting reversals and our fights were now even.

367
00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:07.000
One afternoon we were training together by ourselves at my dad's ranch. The only thing I remember is engaging with roles then going through the eye of the hurricane with all the violence you would expect when the storm passed I had holes in a choke and before I even realized what was happening he was tapping.

368
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:15.000
It was a completely reactive fight. I'm not even sure if I was mounted around his back all I remember that I finished him with a choke.

369
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I felt saw me beat holes and when we finished training he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and said you did good kid I'm proud of you.

370
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:37.000
What I remember most about that fight was the sadness I felt afterward as the way I had made a mistake by beating him a huge but invisible weight of responsibility had shifted from holes as shoulders to mine.

371
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:46.000
I knew that I was now a better fighter but worse so did he. It wasn't luck or a fluke holes just didn't just couldn't surprise me anymore.

372
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
I also realized that I would never have to beat him again to prove it.

373
00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Were you bigger than him or are you smaller than him or are you guys about the same size?

374
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:13.000
I was a little bigger this time maybe five to ten pounds heavier. He was maybe one sixty eight pounds and I was seventy four.

375
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
No he was sixty eight kilos and I was seventy four kilos.

376
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:26.000
You get your black belt.

377
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:35.000
And that's you know this is always an interesting thing when someone you know you get that edge on someone that's been beating you for your whole life.

378
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Yes, it was a very special feeling because I have him as my idol as my coach as my training partner.

379
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000
But at the same time my goal was beating him because no other way I have to change this pattern.

380
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.000
I have to to be the best so my goal as a student is to be better than my teacher.

381
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And when I achieved that I felt like somehow was was not exactly positive the way I felt because I put him in a bad side and a bad mode or feeling he was not exactly the best anymore.

382
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
He's number two.

383
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So it was a sad thing for me and was a happy thing for me but my my my demonstration of love and respect was after that even though we go in every tournament and I go in he I go in my way division he go in his way division and we go both for open.

384
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And before that we close the bracket because we could not fight before the finals because we're representing the same brand.

385
01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:03.000
So and the finals I always gave it to him the victory we got not fighting him and even after I could be able to beat him I still doing this for life you know and to he pass out.

386
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So I always gave it to him because I felt like he was my.

387
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I honor his representative to me and so he was going to beat number one and I'm number two.

388
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:25.000
For the word I can be throw the line through to the lines before him but in the official tournament where he goes with me.

389
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I would be capable in my honor and my integrity to take his medal you know or to fight him or to tell him I'm better than him.

390
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:49.000
So he was the champion of the family and two he passed away and after he passed I take I take the responsibility for myself.

391
01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And when I turn with people and I'll be training with them for a long time and you know sometimes I say one day I'm going to get you you know they have that goal one day I'm going to get you and I always say yeah of course and I say listen.

392
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:12.000
And if you put a jiu jitsu move on me that I didn't expect right and see coming we'll happen. Let's go to happen I'm going to tap that's the way it works.

393
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It's beautiful thing yeah that's what we train for.

394
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You have a situation here where you had a little lesson learned you said I was growing so dominant jitsu competition that when I stepped on the mat and the referee said go the crowd would begin to chat chant.

395
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:50.000
And then nine eight seven six if I didn't submit my opponent in ten seconds they would start counting again even as a black belt my only jiu jitsu fight that went more than five minutes came after the judges robbed my brother hoiler of a win against one of my cousin Carlson students.

396
01:02:50.000 --> 01:03:02.000
My final match was in the open class was against Carlson's 240 pound heavyweight I was so upset that I decided that I wanted to make him suffer after I got him down I mounted and just put unbearable pressure on him.

397
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I was not fighting my actual opponent instead I was trying to punish Carlson for robbing hoiler.

398
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
I'm God I wasn't that guy.

399
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Everything I was doing was fueled by ego and anger and I was working against myself because my emotions were negating all my precision and martial artistry.

400
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:29.000
I was spinning my wheels as if I were on ice going nowhere I was just blindly punishing him until until holds yelled eight minutes are up I was shocked to see.

401
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I was shocked because that was too long I snapped to my senses got mad on myself and easily submitted him afterward I realized that I never wanted to fight like this again because I was putting emotion before reason although nobody else realized that the time I learned an important lesson that day that it was a mistake to fight emotionally because emotions blinded me.

402
01:03:51.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Yes, I think the biggest experience I have in that matter was on my first fight with Zulu which I was 19 he was 30 something years old he had 120 fights and only four draws and 120 victories.

403
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:23.000
So he was a professional, a valid to the guy no holds bar fighter and I was just watching my dad talking in the phone with his manager trying to set up somebody to fight him.

404
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And my dad said no man I'm sorry about them I don't have nobody to fight this guy because you know we are and then I catch the conversation said that please pull me and pull me and pull me and look at me and said yes for them I have here my son with 19 years old.

405
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:47.000
He made one a try and what they must have said no he's not something I try out for a kid the guy stuff is mean.

406
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And as my as the guy tried to talk my dad out of the deal my dad's got emotionally but I think I'm going to put him because I like to try the kids see how goes.

407
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So and then set up a fight for me with this Zulu guy and I went to the his state the capital.

408
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
And then the day of the fight.

409
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:26.000
We engage he has this kind of typical move he does which goes and put one hand between your legs and connect you and then lift everything and throw you back on the floor some kind of cataguruma in his style.

410
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
How much how much Zulu away?

411
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
About 230 and he's just a beast of a human you said he had 100 and something fights.

412
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Yes, he was just an orthodox he has no sharp techniques but he was just a very intuitive animal very flexible very strong very many you know.

413
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
A very complete fighter for the time.

414
01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And I was to start to deal with him and as he go for his straight move and this is what sorry for interrupting you but this is your first actual fight that you're ever going to fight my first.

415
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000
And he's a very unique fighter and that's what he's doing.

416
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And how many people are at this fight?

417
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
About 10,000.

418
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
5,000 people.

419
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And you have the gracing name?

420
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yes.

421
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
At stake.

422
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Yes.

423
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Your 19 years old?

424
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yes.

425
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
How much are you?

426
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
About once I mean 74 kilos.

427
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Yeah, 75.

428
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
He came for the straight move.

429
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I kind of understood why he came.

430
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I hold his shoulders and his head was down.

431
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
So I hit him with my knee.

432
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.000
The strongest hit, the solid hit I could imagine possibly give to somebody.

433
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And after the hit, he just lifted his head.

434
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And he had shook his face like speed at two.

435
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And come like nothing happened.

436
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
And I get scared.

437
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I get to the ground.

438
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I thought I want to kill the guy and he just shook his hand.

439
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
He's head.

440
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So we start to back to the engagement and he threw me off the ring.

441
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I went back again and I got him in the back many times.

442
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
He hit him with the elbow.

443
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
He threw himself out of the ring and we start again.

444
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And again after the first round 10 minutes we stopped.

445
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And I was dead tired.

446
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So I was crawling through my corner.

447
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And when I get the corner said dead, I quit.

448
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I cannot go anymore.

449
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I'm exhausted.

450
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Dead not even hear me.

451
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
He said, oh he's the worst.

452
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
And you're going to do it.

453
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
He's going to do it.

454
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I'm serious.

455
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I start to argue with my dead.

456
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Trying to clean my case.

457
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
He said, hey man, I'm exhausted.

458
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I'm tired.

459
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And he didn't even listen to me.

460
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
He started to kill me.

461
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And then my brother hauled me a bucket with water and ice and my head.

462
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And then the bell rings and I back to the action.

463
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And like my dad said, three minutes after he was sleepy.

464
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I could get his back.

465
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
He was tired.

466
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I choke him out.

467
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And then I realized my worst enemy was my mind.

468
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Was the worst enemy I could ever have.

469
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
You're not going to handle the guy is strong.

470
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
So I realized if I was trusting myself, I was done.

471
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So I could not have this enemy, this powerful enemy hanging on my head all the time.

472
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So I decide now I will fight to die.

473
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
But I'm not going to quit anymore.

474
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Quitting is not my word anymore.

475
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Either you're going to die or I'm going to win.

476
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
But no Quitting.

477
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:45.000
So it was maybe the biggest lesson in action I have ever had because I wouldn't stand.

478
01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.000
How your apart mindset can really kill you from waiting.

479
01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:01.000
And I understood that and from that home I was just putting all my mental, spiritual, physical and one direction.

480
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And the other direction is only that.

481
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
No Quitting, no.

482
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
But I think I'm done nothing like this.

483
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So my brother has the idea of if something happened through the towel because I'm not going to quit.

484
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So in that kind of make me happy because I become a warrior in a good direction.

485
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
And thanks my dad for letting me quit.

486
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Sometimes I bet you can kill you.

487
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I bet coach can kill you if he has saved your moments.

488
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You know, so you have to transcend that kind of panicking and just back to normal and regain confidence.

489
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And after I learned that I was completely different guy.

490
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I'm much more superior entity in terms of putting everything to go.

491
01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000
All my back edge was together always and I felt like it was a blast by that.

492
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Now I was going to ask you how you changed or what did you learn from that fight from a training perspective.

493
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
What did you do different?

494
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
But I know that this is around this time that this one you got way into doing yoga with Orlando Connie.

495
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yes, I was a little before that because since my 12 year old, the weather rolled myself on the carpet.

496
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Feeling the panicking, the claustrophobic feeling was always close to me a little bit.

497
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I always been an athlete, I always run forever, training forever and young guy.

498
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It was always been natural for me being competitive and fight and do whatever.

499
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:54.000
But at one point, if you don't have, if you don't master breathing, when you get to tie it, you get confused, you get your mind fading away.

500
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
It's not an easy way, enough oxygen in your brain and your muscles for you to feel clear mind and still getting tired and still sharp.

501
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:09.000
So I felt like it was always a lack of this profound understanding.

502
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:17.000
And one day because my mother hit Pumichu Du Yoga in one point and I did and I stopped because I didn't like it.

503
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I transcended our meditation which make you see it and repeat a mantra for a while and start to open your mind.

504
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:34.000
I also ended up by sleeping almost all the time and not teaching a doctor much about it by that, so it was not for me.

505
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And then a friend recommended me to go to Orlando Connie, which was Army Pentatl on champion.

506
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:52.000
He was also a yoga teacher and it was to start to develop some kind of exercising with movement and breathing which can be very helpful.

507
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So I went that to this guy and he knows my dad, he's very friendly guy, he said, okay, so go to the class and practice with us.

508
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
So I started to go into his class with other people and he started to practice.

509
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And right on the second time he said, he's very flexible, very strong, even top high athlete.

510
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I like to teach you personally because I can improve your speed, I can improve you personally more than the class.

511
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000
He said great.

512
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:29.000
So I started to do in the film a couple of times a week, only privately with him and his place which is mirrors.

513
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And one side has the wall and has the wood attached on the wall for you to hang.

514
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So from here to the roof, all his wood is kind of, so you play different games and you sometimes you imitate a manker, sometimes you imitate a hero, a crocodile or whatever.

515
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:55.000
So you play animals and moves and breathes and he's touched it, teach me to work the diaphragmatic breathing.

516
01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And that's going for a month, for two months, almost three months on that.

517
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:09.000
One day we about to initiate the practice, he said, he's so, I mean, the bell rings, the phone rings.

518
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And he said, you keep doing because I'm going to take the phone and come back.

519
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So for the first time I was doing the exercise without a leader.

520
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:29.000
I was improvising myself to do my things and breathing and doing my things and breathing and things going.

521
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And then eventually I opened my eyes like wake up.

522
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:45.000
And I was hanging on the top wall, on the top wood and the wall side, hanging like a monkey, dripping sweat.

523
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:55.000
And I opened my eyes and I kind of started to understand where I was, I kind of wake up and I saw, all along the city, I mean standing up on the corner.

524
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And he said to me, kind of crying a little bit, he said, hexon.

525
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I don't think you need me anymore because you achieved the highest level.

526
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I said, why you say that, master, why you say that?

527
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Said because you're here for an hour and 50 minutes.

528
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.000
And I call you a few times, I try to get your attention and you cannot even hear me.

529
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You completely admit, meditative state of mind, empty mind, doing your things, breathing, moving.

530
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And now you just wake up.

531
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Now you just put yourself conscience again.

532
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Before it was just reflexes and subconscious mind.

533
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And I realized I could achieve meditative state of mind, empty mind, through that practice.

534
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:51.000
So through that practice which I start to do and then my academy on the beach, I start to understand breathing.

535
01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And I much more profound way, not only to help me mechanically, not only to help me to charge myself and review my energy from the oxygen standard point.

536
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But also to give me some kind of meditative state of mind, empty mind, be drunk, will be able to control my emotions.

537
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:32.000
So this practice becomes a central part of my life because by breathing, I could be able to not only have a better functional strength and ability to recover faster from tiredness.

538
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:45.000
But also what is very interesting is the lungs because the heart and the brain are the only organs who are able to give and receive information.

539
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So sometimes you can get affected by reading a bed in May or you can get a stress immediately, get affected.

540
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Sometimes you see something which is relevant, somebody will love or somebody touch you.

541
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:04.000
You immediately emotionally bite the heart, they can get information and they can send information for you and say, I'm not happy.

542
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Some take care of me, I'm not happy, the care of me, I'm very exhausted. So your tired, your heart can tell you or your brain, or I'm confused and stressed, I'm afraid I'm out of my game.

543
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So the brain and the heart are there to be controlled by the lungs.

544
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:31.000
These are the most fast, the most effective way for you to deal directly with your brain and with your heart.

545
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:53.000
For example, if you hear, you just read a bed in May and you stress.

546
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:29.000
If I keep that routine for three minutes, no stress can keep on because I have to control.

547
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.000
I have to integrate motion and movement, breathing and movement together.

548
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And as I start to play on this, nothing can be like, I cannot think about all the time to travel.

549
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I have to go to San Diego tomorrow, I have to give my daughter whatever it is.

550
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000
You have to refresh her because the way you breathe, you can really clean your mind.

551
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:09.000
The way you breathe, you can lower your heart rates for fighting, for example, I was doing like I get an event, three hours before the event, my fight.

552
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000
So I go to the locker room, sleep for an hour and a half hour, 40 minutes, by wheel, I just breathing my relax, breathing and can sleep deeply.

553
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Wake up one hour before the fight, warm myself up for 45 minutes, putting my heart rates to 160, 140 to really break the sweat and make sure I'm cool.

554
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.000
And then sit for five minutes and being my heart rate to 65, hard beats a minute.

555
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:44.000
So I was deeply raw hot, ready to go with my heart beat, boom, boom, boom, boom.

556
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So I see my other opponent and the other side of the ring jumping around, he's already 85, 90.

557
01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So when I engage, I engage not to make some kind of nice reading, I try to improve press the gas and let's go for power.

558
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000
So we do everything we can do. So if I'm a struggle, you cannot rest, you have to keep up with me.

559
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:19.000
So when I'm 80, you 110, when I'm 110, you 150, when I'm 150, you already try to, I had a hard attack.

560
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So you start to regroup and start to seek for air and that's time normally where mistakes happen and I really make the close the deal.

561
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:40.000
So breathing, being come at my best friend, not only to control my emotions, to keep my heart rate and the best performance to regroup.

562
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:51.000
So to be controlling panic, controlling emotions, become calm, to strategize, everything coming from this capacity, we tend to control yourself by breathing.

563
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:59.000
So I felt like was a great addition to my, my pratics and makes a huge change in my life.

564
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:17.000
This is something that I connected the dots on a few years ago because people would ask me, I would say, listen, when things are going bad, you have to stay calm, you have to learn how to control your emotions and don't get all excited about something which things are going wrong.

565
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And people would say, well, how do you do it? And one of the things that I realized that I would do is, so in the military, you know, you have a radio with you.

566
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And when you talk on the radio, everybody can hear you.

567
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And in the military, it's very frowned upon if you get on the radio and you are emotional, if you scream, help over here.

568
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:54.000
If you panic like this. So every time I ever talked on the radio, my goal was to never sound, panic, never sound emotional, no matter what was going on, sound very common cool.

569
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:00.000
So that means whenever things were going crazy and I was about to have to get on the radio, what would I have to do?

570
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I had to breathe. I had to take a breath.

571
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:12.000
And so it's the same thing, it's just that something that I was doing, so that I could, you know, I'd be in the, oh, there's got stuff going on here. Okay, I'm about talking radio.

572
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Hey, this is Jaka. We need about 10 more guys down at this building right now.

573
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And that me taking control of my of my breath also would help me get into a controlled emotional state where I'm not losing my mind.

574
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:41.000
That's very powerful from Jiu Jitsu. Yes, because you know the, the breathing system, because you stay seven days without food, you stay three days without water.

575
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Five minutes without oxygen, it was already dead. Yes. So the efficiency of the breathing system is very needed and people take this for granted. They don't, I, I, I, I born, I get slap on the butt.

576
01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And you are live and well and you can live like if you don't training breathing, it's like your biceps, it's like your, your, your strategy, your techniques, your, if you don't training the breathing system, you're going to work with 40% less the capacity, the capabilities to really refresh yourself, hyperventilate,

577
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:32.000
bringing yourself to a next level of understanding because if you get tired, you don't know how to hyperventilate, you get tired in your mind, start to phase to fade a little bit, you start to making poor decisions, you start to get

578
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:57.000
completely off your game because it's no oxygen enough for the brain and the, and the body. But if you know how to hyperventilate, you can have cramps, as it's a lot of callover, you can not even move well, very tired, but your brain is too sharp, you can see the tails, you can see the, the gals, my, you can see the support, you can see everything you want to see and talk because your brain is too fresh.

579
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And that's the capacity you have to learn how to hyperventilate and use the diaphragmatic breathing, which improves your life like a don.

580
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:24.000
That's awesome stuff. Going through the book, I mean, at this time, you also, you had met your, you had met Kim. Yes, you, she got pregnant with your first son. Yes, at this time.

581
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:35.000
And she was what some kind of a model, some kind of a several years old. She was the first sponsor, surfer girl in Brazil. She was doing hangliding.

582
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:47.000
She was a top model for fashion. She do some, some modeling for, for soap operas and stuff. So she was pretty, pretty hot girl at the time.

583
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:58.000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit here. So you, you have your first son. It says the year 1982 was a bittersweet one.

584
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I was now the father of the son. I had always dreamed of, but I also suffered a devastating loss in June, holes and his family went for a family weekend in the mountains.

585
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000
holes noticed his old hanglider was strapped the roof of a car in front of his hotel. It turned out that the owner was a friend of a friend.

586
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Even though my brother had promised his wife, Angela, that he would quit hangliding after he'd had several close calls and friends had died in accidents. He made arrangements to go the next day.

587
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:38.000
The following day, the conditions were very bad because there was no wind. If holes got his mind set on something, however, there was no saying no to him.

588
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Although the owner of his old hanglider did not want to go because he thought it was too dangerous, holes talked him into letting him use it for just one flight.

589
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:56.000
My brother ran down the ramp, launched, initially got some lift, but then began to spiral and he hit the ground 90 yards from the ramp.

590
01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:09.000
His friend ran into the overgrown forest and found my brother hanging upside down with his eyes wide open, although he looked perfectly fine. His neck was broken and holes was dead.

591
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I received the news over the phone and it took only seconds to know that my life would never be the same.

592
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:28.000
But I lost an idol, a teacher, and my favorite brother, but I was now officially the family champion. Now I would have to answer all the challenges and lead the next generation of Gracie Fighters.

593
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
I was now my family's last line of defense.

594
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
His death affected our family dynamics dramatically.

595
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:52.000
He was at the two sides together because he was Carlos' son, but raised by Alio. He acted as a bridge between the two sides of the family, but now that bridge was gone forever.

596
01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I know my original teacher, Fabio Santos. He was originally a host as well.

597
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The way he talked about holes was elevated beyond belief.

598
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Fabio has a passion for holes, not only for the teachings and being a huge guy and inspire him to do the best, but they also have a lot of chinkoamu.

599
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:30.000
They go out together, so they're good friends, so what's devastating for Fabio?

600
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:40.000
At this time, on top of all this, you start to have this kind of famous rivalry with Luta Livri Fighters.

601
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I had some interesting things going on there. Again, this book is filled with so many of these details that people will be interested in.

602
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Meanwhile, you have a daughter, right?

603
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Yes.

604
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Your first daughter.

605
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And then a second daughter.

606
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Now you're up to three kids, and again, these are all things that are detailed in the book and all kinds of interesting stories around that. You also say the Gracie Clan continued to divide along bloodlines.

607
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:28.000
While Horyn was trying to establish our martial arts in the United States, Carlos Gracie Jr. was going in a different direction in Brazil and primarily focusing on a competitive form of Gigiitsu that would become known as sport Gigiitsu.

608
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And this is what a thing I appreciated. You said, I had little interest in the politics of Gigiitsu. I had three children to support. I wanted to fight Valaituto professionally and the only place to do that outside of Brazil was in Japan.

609
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000
So at this point, Horyn had moved to America.

610
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Yes.

611
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And you're looking at possibly fighting in Japan.

612
01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Yes. Going with my friend to Japan, you see if I can find some, I was having a letter of introduction to Antonio Noche, which was in Bassa, daughter in Japan, very famous wrestler.

613
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And I tried to find a pick a fight through him in Japan.

614
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.000
So I was there, but I was, you know, I could not achieve my goal and back to Brazil.

615
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
And then you have Crone, his born. Yes.

616
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
And now things are really seem to be heating up with the Luta Leveria Academy.

617
01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And there's a, at one point, you guys drove over to the Luta Leveria Academy.

618
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
I got him. Yes.

619
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
You say here, we walked in in 20 or 30 fighters, stop training and stared at us.

620
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Marco, who asked, walked over and greeted us. Everyone's very respectful at first.

621
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I told who asked that I heard he wanted to fight me and I was there to fight him.

622
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000
He said that he wanted to fight, but that would, that he would need four months to prepare.

623
01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000
This made me feel that he was more interested in capitalizing on the fight than proving himself, which pissed me off.

624
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I was the one who walked into that lion's then ready and willing to fight for nothing but honor.

625
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It started to get heated and my dad stepped between us to calm things down.

626
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:17.000
And then you have Hugo Dwarthe, it's kind of stepped in and, you know, saying, hey, I'll fight you too.

627
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:23.000
And then you said, I had a friend tell Hugo to meet me at Pay Pay Beach on Saturday.

628
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I got sick the week of the fight and was thinking about postponing it until my messenger called and said,

629
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000
it's all set. Hugo will be there on Saturday.

630
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Now I knew there was no backing out, so I started to eat well and get ready.

631
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
You get to the beach.

632
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
You get to the beach.

633
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I walk up to Hugo and slap them in the face.

634
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
He took off his shirt and sandals and we began to wrestle and defeat until I was able to drag him to the ground.

635
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Hugo used my pony tail to control my head and stood back up.

636
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
He fell on top of me then I swept him, but my knee got buried in the sand and Hugo escaped.

637
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
We stood back up and smashed into a vendor stand that we went down on the ground again with the crowd surging all around us.

638
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Again, get wrapped in and begin to punch him in the face out will.

639
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
There was nothing he could do to stop the punches.

640
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.000
When I asked Hugo if you wanted to give up, he said, you'll have to kill me.

641
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So I kept blasting him with punches and elbows.

642
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
After a few more blows to the face, he changed his mind and said, okay, stop.

643
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I let him go.

644
01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
That's another one you can find on YouTube.

645
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
That'll be a fight.

646
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Probably has a billion views.

647
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Fast forward a little bit of a week later, I was sleeping when my friend pulled up in front of the apartment on his motorcycle and screamed,

648
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Hicks and those motherfuckers invaded your dad's academy.

649
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Boy, that seems like a bad move.

650
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
It seems like a real bad move.

651
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yes, but it was crazy.

652
01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
They came for a revenge.

653
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Hugo was prepared for a next fight.

654
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
He was not happy with what happened on the beach.

655
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:12.000
So as they walk maybe about three or four miles walk from a different area of the city.

656
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
And some of the guys who are with him are coming from the girls, like gang bang.

657
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:27.000
They come in with like the face masks on the face, guns, knives, bottles.

658
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I mean, all crazy, not only fighters but also gang bangers.

659
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000
So when I get into the school, when I was getting in my friend's motorcycle on the

660
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:50.000
street, I saw about 200 people in front of the school.

661
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Half of the street already, we fool of guys, so the traffic was jammed.

662
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:01.000
So I get into with my bike, with my friends bike inside the crowd.

663
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
And immediately go up to the stairs on the street, going to the school.

664
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
And I meet Hugo coming down with my father and other guys, like about 20 Luta, Levery guys.

665
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
They stood and so we all meet in the middle of the stairs.

666
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
So I said, let's go down and talk and fight.

667
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
So we went down to the parking lot.

668
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And I call him with his coach and another guy who fought a lot afterwards, the Ogenio Tadio.

669
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
They went to a corner and my father and we talk.

670
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.000
And I said to him, hey man, I respect you.

671
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.000
I see you come here for a revenge and I accept that.

672
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000
But you brought a lot of bad guys, a lot of guys who has no integrity, no fighters.

673
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000
If somebody touched the fight before this over, you're going to end up on the ditch sometime.

674
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I promise you, you're going to be on the ditch very soon.

675
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
No, no, it's fight for men, men to men, me and you, nobody going to touch the fights just me.

676
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Okay, so let's go back to the crowd and let's fight.

677
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So then we kind of create a circle on the concrete and crowd around me and him.

678
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And who I felt like from the first from the previous fight, he felt like he was missing the stand-up game.

679
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
He was missing punch me and the face.

680
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Somebody told him, maybe, oh, he should start fighting him punch you.

681
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Don't grab or him, just so I felt in his stand.

682
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
He was looking for to hit me hard, you know.

683
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And I play dummy, I play a kind of little unaware and expect his attack when he came in with a direct, I deflected, grab his body, lift, throw him on the ground

684
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:49.000
and bang him on the concrete mount and start to punch him on the head, he protected his face.

685
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I put my hands on the top of his head and push his head against the floor, couple of times, and he soft up a little bit.

686
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
And then he said, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

687
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:08.000
So I stopped it, stand up, he stood up and said, okay, man, I respect you.

688
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
He's all cool for us now.

689
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
Said, okay, man, I respect you, you have a potential, you know, you can become a great fighter.

690
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000
So we shook hands.

691
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And as we start to finish that to terminate our problem,

692
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:30.000
we'll probably start to fight the Eugenio Tadeel right there, you know. And the confusion stills, and then the police coming.

693
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:37.000
And one guy, a police guy, very short guy with a cigarette and a mustache, I cannot forget this guy.

694
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
He got a gun machine and shoot on the roof.

695
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000
So the bullets touch the roof and coming down, hit somebody on the leg and stuff.

696
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And I don't know, I want to see who I'm fighting. The guy was very funny.

697
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
So in then, hollers fight to a spowspone for next week.

698
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:58.000
They fought again with the same guy.

699
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
But my deal with who was resolved.

700
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
How to fight with hollers grow?

701
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Was a draw because we put 10 guys from Lutalivri, 10 guys from Jujitsu and Auditorium, close doors.

702
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000
And hollers will fight the guy to the end, right?

703
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:25.000
So in then they start to fight, hollers get punched in the face and lost the tooth.

704
01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And then the fight continues, hollers control the guy, he put the guy in a bad position, but not submitting.

705
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
And the guy said, okay, I want to quit.

706
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
If I was no better, if I was smarter, I said, okay, stop, hollers win.

707
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But I was pissed and was going to see hollers revenge the punch.

708
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Said, okay, hollers, you just stop the fight. If you want to keep fighting, keep beating this guy.

709
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And the guy that for Lutalivri stood up and said, put him, but that's not it.

710
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I push him down like sit down here and shout out.

711
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
The guy was acquitted, you know, he was not a tough brave guy.

712
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
So he don't want to fight, he said, pull him here.

713
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000
So why you did that? No, they're going to fight until the end.

714
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:14.000
So they keep fighting and eventually hollers get tired and both get tired.

715
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000
So they agreed to stop. We want to stop, okay, stop. So they stopped and was a draw.

716
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I should stop the fight sooner and make hollers victory.

717
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.64
But I was not exactly, for me was not the politics or the was just, you know, the guy just

718
01:36:28.64 --> 01:36:32.000
reserved some points in the face and hollered, missed to get it.

719
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
So for me was a missing point where I want to see happen and didn't happen.

720
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Man, hollered. He's he's a, I train with hollered and he helped us out.

721
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I don't know our academy here a lot, man. What a great freaking Jiu Jitsu player.

722
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
He is, he's a warrior.

723
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
For sure, 100%.

724
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Yeah.

725
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
It's kind of kind of cool, you know, you talked a little bit about forgiveness already today.

726
01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.000
But you, you say this in the book, looking back today on the fights between Jiu Jitsu and Lutalivri.

727
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I see them very differently. At the time, we were all young men full of aggression and testosterone.

728
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
The rivalry between our two martial arts made all of us better fighters.

729
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Steel, sharp, and steel. We should all be grateful for the fact that we always had the ability to fight one another

730
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
respectfully. Although there were black eyes, bloody noses and broken teeth, our fights were always one-on-one

731
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
and were governed by honor and mutual respect. It was part of the natural competitive process.

732
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
It was no accident that Marco Huos, Hugo Duarte, Denison Maia,

733
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:38.000
Eugene to do my brothers and some of my cousins and I would all go on to fight mixed martial arts professionally in America and Japan.

734
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Definitely a good attitude to have.

735
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Yes.

736
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Competitive, but respectful against these other guys.

737
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yes.

738
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
It's an honor between fighters. It's not about it's not something we've had to have integrity.

739
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.000
I have respect. That's part of the cold. Something I highly appreciated.

740
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
The next chapter in this book is coming to America.

741
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
You say there's a little left from me to prove in Brazil at that point.

742
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
America was a bigger stage and more opportunity.

743
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And I thought my kids would have a brighter future there.

744
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.000
When I decided to move to the US, Kim and I had been separated for over a year and a half.

745
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I went to see her and told her I would like her to come with me and the kids and give our relationship another chance.

746
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
She agreed to my offer. I wanted to make a fresh start.

747
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
While I might have been the best fighter in the Gracie family,

748
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Horian was by far the best promoter of Gracie Giu-Gitsu.

749
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
He was a born salesman with a great product to sell and nothing helped spread Giu-Giu

750
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
to more than the portable video camera.

751
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:44.000
After Horian and Horian came to America, he began challenging fighters from other styles at videotaping the bouts.

752
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Footage from these and other fights transformed what would have been urban myths into documented truth.

753
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
In 1988 Horian put together a video called Gracie in action,

754
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000
which he advertised in the back of martial arts magazines and sold by mail order.

755
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000
There you go. That's the beginning.

756
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That's the beginning. That's the beginning right there.

757
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
That's when the words started to get out.

758
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Yes.

759
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Because you hear it, but to see it is something totally different.

760
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Yes.

761
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That's a brilliant marketing move. Hey, come and fight.

762
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Anybody wants to come and fight, come and fight.

763
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000
We're going to video it and then we're going to show it to the world.

764
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Yes.

765
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.000
That's a brilliant move.

766
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I think so true. He was a genius on that.

767
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I know a Fabio when I trained at Fabios.

768
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.000
He had some of those videos that weren't even in the videos.

769
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And he would show them to us.

770
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000
Like on a special Friday night, we'd get to watch some real Gracie in action videos.

771
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
People's arms get broken because they didn't want to tap.

772
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Exactly.

773
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You go on here.

774
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Students regularly fought in one challenge matches against other fighters and then converted them into students.

775
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Chuck Norris for one.

776
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000
The actor in American martial arts icon was not only a great supporter, but was also a dedicated student who eventually earned his black belt.

777
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
In the 1980s, Norris took a vacation in Rio.

778
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Everywhere he went, he heard about Gracie Gizzi and the exploits of my family.

779
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Norris contacted my dad and arranged to have a private lesson.

780
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
After I grappled with him, my dad told Norris to mount him.

781
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And when he did, said, OK, Chuck punch me.

782
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000
The American hesitated, but my dad was in his 70s by then, but Alio kept insisting.

783
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Finally, Norris drew back his arm to punch, but before he could throw one, the old man to choke them out.

784
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Chuck left Brazil and pressed by the Gracie family and invited us to come to America and hold a seminar for his students.

785
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Fast forward a little bit.

786
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Horyeon and the actor had a disagreement over money.

787
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
This is after one of those seminars.

788
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Chuck Norris hired our cousins, the Machado brothers, Carlos Higgin, Hossier,

789
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
John Jock and John to teach him.

790
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
The Machado's came from a more stable upper middle class background than we did.

791
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Their father was a judge and they did not grow up in Rio.

792
01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Not only were they much more reasonable than Horyeon, they were great Gizzi fighters and teachers in their own right.

793
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
John Jock Machado is an inspiring person who went on to become one of the greatest Gizzi teachers in America.

794
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Born with only a thumb and part of a pinky on one of his hands,

795
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:16.000
John Jock learned how to adapt and improvise better than anyone I had ever seen.

796
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
His Gizzi was both intensely personal and creative.

797
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So you had the Machado brothers now teaching Chuck Norris.

798
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yes. But you did, there's a video there's a video you go on against Chuck Norris's.

799
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Isn't there?

800
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Is a little mistake on that video that video in the seminar?

801
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:43.000
It's a very strong talk, blond guy who was a Chuck Norris good student.

802
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Tough guy.

803
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It was not Chuck at that time.

804
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:47.000
I was part of Chuck.

805
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I teach him a few times and I sporey film a few times.

806
01:41:50.000 --> 01:42:00.000
So he knows our power but the training was not with him at the time.

807
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
When you showed up in America, you didn't even speak English.

808
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:04.000
No, no.

809
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Where Horyeon or the speaking was?

810
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
He came prior to that. He came a few times to America in the 70s and stuff.

811
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:19.000
So he loved here, the culture and the study of learning and working different jobs and try to make Hollywood

812
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
work as an actor as a stuntman.

813
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
So he likes to speak the English.

814
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So he learned very quickly and very effectively.

815
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Fast forward a little bit.

816
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Even though Alio wanted Horyeon to lead the Gracie's in America,

817
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
it was easier said than done.

818
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
There were just too many of us moving in different directions and Horyeon's efforts to control the clan backfired.

819
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:53.000
After he threatened to sue members of the Gracie family whom he had grown up with on the mats for using their own Gracie last name,

820
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
many family members surrendered.

821
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Gracie Jiu-Jitsu got renamed Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

822
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I believe that if my brother had allowed everyone to use our family name, our martial art would still be called Gracie Jiu-Jitsu today,

823
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and perhaps it'd be even bigger than it is.

824
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:14.000
So I wanted to mention that part in the book because I think Echo Charles and I get asked at least ten times a week.

825
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
I train Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

826
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
What's the difference between the two?

827
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Is there a difference between the two?

828
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And I think you summed it up right there pretty well.

829
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:33.000
I think we start doing Jiu-Jitsu in the protocol where you have to learn self defense.

830
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:39.000
You don't have, you don't require to use collar belts, no collar belts at that time.

831
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:48.000
So I student can be ten years a student in a steel white belt and the instructor will be forever a dark blue belt.

832
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So that's what's their reference.

833
01:43:50.000 --> 01:44:01.000
And then in 65 my father started to create the federation because the demand is growing big and a lot of people try to train in.

834
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:05.000
So he started creating a rules for the federation for the sports rules.

835
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:15.000
And that's the difference between the collar belts because if you ten years white belt you're going to be better than a six months white belt.

836
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And if it's not fair for them to compete.

837
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:22.000
So let's make a blue belt for people to create the reference.

838
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Not only for practice but for competition because a new warrior is not going to be a world warrior.

839
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So let's make different rankings.

840
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:38.000
And that's was the process for callers belts was the evaluation of levels and stuff.

841
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:47.000
So with this Jiu-Jitsu becomes also a sports Jiu-Jitsu has points, mount position, throw it.

842
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.000
And has the self defense aspect which lead you to a more open mind situation.

843
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:00.000
If somebody come in with a knife, if two against one, if the guy coming to punch me is no punch is Jiu-Jitsu.

844
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
So you start to open your mind to possibilities for unpredictable situations.

845
01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Against a knife, against a punch with fight with glove, fight without.

846
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
So you start to become a more open mind.

847
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:25.000
So with the coming to America, after especially after horse, kick ass on the UFC, people start to say, wow, what this kid did with the guise.

848
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
So people want to land Jiu-Jitsu, but they also want to compete in Jiu-Jitsu.

849
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:38.000
In competition becomes bigger than the actual platform for learning Jiu-Jitsu with self defense.

850
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.000
The technical protocols for spending technically the Jiu-Jitsu are not there.

851
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Just Brazilian companies with experience of fighters, to experience how to fight and they come here and display and fight.

852
01:45:53.000 --> 01:46:03.000
So in many great Jiu-Jitsu academies or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academies, people teach how to pass a guard, people teach how to choke or to go a foot lock,

853
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:14.000
but they don't teach gun retention, harassment, control, knife attacks and fighting without gloves, fight, striking.

854
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:22.000
So because that lack of information, competition Jiu-Jitsu becomes much bigger than the self defense Jiu-Jitsu.

855
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And now Brazilian, anyone can do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, can fight, can pass guard, can do sweeps.

856
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:45.000
But not anyone knows the total grace Jiu-Jitsu, which self defense and elaborate techniques for self defense, like the law enforcement programs or situations require more techniques.

857
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So that's basically today, it's a big difference. When people refer to great Jiu-Jitsu, they go more towards the traditional aspect of the art.

858
01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:00.000
And when they talk about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, they really recognize as a competition.

859
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:12.000
But they say they are the same with lack of information, you know, in both sides, because sometimes now you see self defense academies, who has no fighting skills.

860
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:21.000
They are more like self defense. And the other academies, they have fighting skills, but they have zero self defense.

861
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:34.000
So it's important to bring those together for the perfect academy become a center of knowledge and practice for competition, not only competition or not only self defense.

862
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:43.000
I don't know if this is positive for an or negative, but I just refer to all of this as Jiu-Jitsu.

863
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Yes, I don't even say Brazilian, I don't say Gracie, but it's just to me, Jiu-Jitsu is all of it.

864
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And that's not just me, I should say.

865
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.000
That's when I talk to everybody in the Jiu-Jitsu community, they just say Jiu-Jitsu.

866
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:06.000
You used to have to say, well, it's different, this is Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and this is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu because you had Japanese Jiu-Jitsu and all these other things. Now, Jiu-Jitsu is Jiu-Jitsu.

867
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
What your dad made?

868
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:16.000
My Federation is Jiu-Jitsu global Federation, no BJJ or no self-democracy, it's a BJJitsu.

869
01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Do you think that some of the confusion also comes from, because you have Gracie Academy of Gracie Bahá, you have Gracie Humáita, and there's so many officially named academies and places that have Gracie in it?

870
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Yes, and we are question is, do you think that that adds to the confusion for people?

871
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:49.000
So we end up, how Jiu-Jitsu, we end up eventually just calling it Jiu-Jitsu? Do you think that that added to the confusion of the separation of them?

872
01:48:49.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Right now, the situation becomes very, very complex, because the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu states for tournaments and competition, the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu is more traditional and Jiu-Jitsu embraces everything.

873
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:16.000
I believe talking about Jiu-Jitsu is the perfect way now to deal with the situation, because it's just Jiu-Jitsu.

874
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And how you practice, we will make the determination if you're going to be MMA Fireer, if you're going to be a police officer, if you're going to be just a practitioner or if you want to compete.

875
01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:37.000
So all this is getting into the Jiu-Jitsu category, which I believe now is from here to the future, becomes Jiu-Jitsu.

876
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Do you find or do you know anything about Gracie Baháles comes off as one that they focus, have heavy competition?

877
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Yes, is that, do you think that's the case?

878
01:49:48.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Because Carlos Gracie Jiu-Jiu-Jiu, in which is the president of the IBJJF, felt like more he feeds the tournaments with his students, better for him as a prophet, better for him as a grow in the politics of Jiu-Jitsu.

879
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:17.000
So he's emphasizing the competition element and creates a team around that, which is very strong Gracie Baháles.

880
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And other teams like Ali-Anse or Czech-Met or other teams that they all come in that same pattern.

881
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So it's very good for the sport.

882
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:38.000
It's their options because that's a lot of time in the question, where it's like, oh, I don't know what to choose and why and all this, they just kind of want to start.

883
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:46.000
But then they hear like, oh, some academy's focus on sport, Jiu-Jitsu, which might not be aligned with my interest.

884
01:50:46.000 --> 01:51:00.000
I feel like for every Jiu-Jitsu practitioner today who is blue belt may be a hundred give up before get the blue belt, at least.

885
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:07.000
If you put in a perspective with Jiu-Jitsu, put you confronting yourself.

886
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Every time you go to the academy, you have to somehow prove yourself. Show yourself is like a tough enough resilient enough capable to create strategies.

887
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000
So is a challenge there.

888
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:35.000
The average Jiu-Jitsu academy, for every ten students who come in to try the Jiu-Jitsu road, eight who will live in less than six months.

889
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Because somehow, you're not only showing the techniques, I show the techniques you love it.

890
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
And then you repeat, you love the class.

891
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:52.000
At the end of the class, say, okay, I can sit, lay down, John, mount.

892
01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:00.000
John, you try to keep your position. I can try to escape. At this point, we unleash the wild.

893
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Yes, the wild, white belts.

894
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Yes, and then that confrontation can lead to a little brute movement, a little violence, or you know sometimes the guys too young, too aggressive.

895
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
So you're going to deal with a beast, which you recognize as your worst nightmare.

896
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:28.000
And you have to basically be comfortable or say, okay, the guy kick my ass today, I'm going to go back there tomorrow, I'm going to fight again.

897
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So you have to have within your capacity to be resilient, to be tough, to be competitive.

898
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:43.000
So when you have this, no matter the road, the bumpy road ahead of you, you're going to get from Jiu-Jitsu, everything he can give you.

899
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Because you have the balls, you have the courage to go there and put yourself there to learn.

900
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Some days you're going to get hurt, some days you're going to hurt somebody, but that's part of the practice.

901
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:01.000
And the people, they don't have to get short on that capacity.

902
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:08.000
So the experience Jiu-Jitsu, they say, oh man, I love Jiu-Jitsu, but it's not for me. I work in computers, I'm artists.

903
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:20.000
You know, you guys are tough, you can do it for me, I'm very gentle, I am a doctor, so they cannot involve in that practice because, in one point, it's not the practice.

904
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:33.000
It's what they have in their hearts, you know, is their courage, is their resilience, they're capacity to handle pain, so the elements are lacking for, if you lack of those elements, you basically,

905
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000
don't find yourself feeling any academy of Jiu-Jitsu because you have to roll.

906
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:49.000
My idea of the future for Jiu-Jitsu is to create a level in Jiu-Jitsu, where you experiment, the essential sensitivities,

907
01:53:49.000 --> 01:54:02.000
it's a sensory Jiu-Jitsu, you start to breathing, you start to feeling the leverage, you start to feeling the angles, you start to feel invisible power, you start to feel your connection, your reflexes, your defenses,

908
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:17.000
for the sake of knowledge, for the sake of being proved, you have a chance, but at least for the first year of practice, you should not have an opponent, you should have only training partners.

909
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:32.000
This way, you're going to have a guy who's going to experiment Jiu-Jitsu, going to love the techniques, going to understand their strategy, and he's going to, he's going to lost weight, he's going to get fit, he's going to get, you know, confident on his knowledge,

910
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
but not to prove all the time, not to be able to go and be a fighter or a competitor.

911
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:49.000
This way, we, we, we, we've the Jiu-Jitsu, we can help, as equity is, you can help anyone, in this, in the full circle,

912
01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:00.000
but if the Jiu-Jitsu is traditional competition, it's drive you to, to, to do, to be an athlete, sometimes you fall short because you don't want to be an athlete.

913
01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000
So, the idea of, give you Jiu-Jitsu something, I never, ever find somebody who don't like Jiu-Jitsu.

914
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Depends how you, being introduced, depends how your practice is.

915
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So, you cannot feel for the good kid, for the tough kid, for the bully, for the, for the shy one, they all love Jiu-Jitsu, if I don't put, for the shy one, the pressure for him to quit.

916
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:40.000
So, he going to love Jiu-Rou, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, he going to love Jiu-Move, for the bully, I'm going to give him, not only the knowledge of Jiu-Jitsu, but I'm going to put him to compete for him to start to respect others, and be more malo in the attitude.

917
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:49.000
So, I can help the bully, I can help the shy one, I can have the, the soft one, the tough, they all can learn, but in a different patterns.

918
01:55:49.000 --> 01:56:18.000
So, what I try to accomplish, and, and, and, and, and, and, still, my time, in my lifetime is, be able to, to create a program who involves anyone in the family, without the, the, the, the idea of, prove yourself, prove you capable, because when you put that kind of challenge, a lot of people not going to enjoy the capacity, the, and the, and the development of their selves.

919
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Well, thinking about it from a, a surfing perspective, because I know Ecos, Ecos planning to start surfing.

920
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:32.000
If I said, okay, welcome to surfing Ecos, and we took them up to Mavericks in half moon bay with 20 foot day.

921
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Or five, yeah, or five blind, but Mavericks even better though, because it's up whatever 52 degree water, it's freezing cold, it's foggy, it's dark, and there's sharks.

922
01:56:43.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Yeah, you are, and even going to go out, you are, and even going to paddle out. Well, you're not even going to paddle out, so, so that's like going to first day of jiu-jitsu, and there's, you know, a 220 pound 21 year old blue belt that's getting ready to crush the person that just showed up that wants to learn.

923
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Yeah, and some academies, you're going to have a better experience in the first day.

924
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:24.000
And the other, and the other, a academy is you've been protected for a month or the second month, so you say, okay, now it's time for you to one hour class 45 minutes, okay, now you guys stop, let's keep rolling, you guys can roll, you can, so you protect somebody from rolling for one or two months, but in one point, you have to allow them to roll, right,

925
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:36.000
and that drop off, you start from that point when you start to understand yourself as having to roll all the time, and that sometimes can be completely depressive for many.

926
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Yes.

927
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:47.000
So taking that challenge, taking that compromise to compete, and allowing yourself to go there to enjoy yourself, is the key for

928
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:54.000
to bring more people to the benefits of jiu-jitsu, because I see like jiu-jitsu can help you.

929
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And in a huge spectrum, not only help you on the mat, but outside of the mat, so sometimes you, you, you practice jiu-jitsu, you become calmer, you become better,

930
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:17.000
better, better, police officer, is just for the practice, you know, so it's a very important element of self-confidence, build self-esteem, and so on.

931
01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:26.000
So it's something we all can do regardless, you're desired to compete or to really fight.

932
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Well, I'm glad it's going where it's going, because it seems to keep growing.

933
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Yeah. For sure. You also, you know, you hear, you mentioned that not only is corny and trying to control all this stuff, but he's also got guys like Hanzo coming in,

934
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:48.000
who's, you know, a great teacher, you said, you said, Hanzo became a father figure two as younger brothers,

935
01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:53.000
half and high, and into many others. By the time he arrived in America, he was already leading many of the younger graces,

936
01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:00.000
and other friends who lacked direction, Hanzo was a born fighter who, rather than getting scared and dangerous situations, got focused,

937
01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Hanzo would go on to be one of the most successful jiu-jitsu teachers in America.

938
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Meanwhile, you had, you say, the West LA karate school rented me their school on Pico Boulevard in an industrial section of Los Angeles.

939
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:21.000
It was a traditional Japanese karate school complete with raised wood and platform, and oil painting of an old Japanese karate master.

940
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Hot in the summer and cold in the winter, my school had no sign, no parking, no windows, no showers, and it was almost impossible to find.

941
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I can vouch for that. But since I was a family champion in California, it was buzzing about the, about Gracie Jiu-jitsu,

942
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
it did not take long for dangerous men from all over the world to find this rundown karate dojo,

943
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
tucked away in an alley next to an auto body shop.

944
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Most of my first generation of students were aspiring professional fighters, lifelong martial artists from other styles,

945
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:59.000
surfers, or professional men of action who use physical force in their daily occupations, soldiers, cops, prison guards, and balancers.

946
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:04.000
That's what I mean by dangerous. Someone to learn while others just wanted to test their skills against us,

947
02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:08.000
but in the end almost all became dedicated Gracie Jiu-jitsu students.

948
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:16.000
My people Academy was a neutral environment where you had to leave your preconceptions and prejudices in the locker room.

949
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I didn't allow it onto the mats. And you certainly did not.

950
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:31.000
This, I thought this was interesting because you say this about coming to America when we first came to the US,

951
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:35.000
came and I were working our asses off just to get by while life on the mat was always the same,

952
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:39.000
life off the mat was more difficult because America was so different from Brazil.

953
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Like the United States, Brazil had been a colony, but it was the, it was one where the Europeans at first went primarily to fill their boats with golden emeralds and go home.

954
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:55.000
In contrast America had been much more idealistic, had a much more idealistic constitution and grew into a more orderly society.

955
02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000
People here did things I'd never seen before. They stood in line, stopped for traffic lights and mostly obeyed the laws.

956
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000
These may seem like obvious requirements for a workable society, but for me it was a strange new world.

957
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:21.000
My transition to living in American society was not always so smooth. You got some good stories about some of the things you went through there.

958
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.000
And it's the same for your kids and you say this moving was probably hardest for hoxon, that's your oldest son.

959
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:34.000
And a few short months he had gone from being the Prince of Rio to being just another skinny Hispanic looking kid in California,

960
02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:40.000
public school who didn't speak English. And his being physically small compared to most of the American kids made him insecure.

961
02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
All the ESL classes in the world can't help that.

962
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:49.000
One morning he came out of his room to go to school with football shoulder pads under a shirt and insisted on wearing them to school.

963
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I said no of course, but I saw right into the source of his pain.

964
02:01:53.000 --> 02:02:00.000
In effort to become a leader, hoxon tried to overcompensate with aggression and become extremely reckless in order to prove himself.

965
02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
He would accept any challenge and fight anyone.

966
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:07.000
When I sent him to elementary school and torrents he wanted to fight every kid there.

967
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:15.000
At least once a month the Prince would call me screaming hoxon fought six kids today. He doesn't understand the rules of basketball and won't let the other kids have the ball.

968
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Another time hoxon came home with a backpack full of candy. He told me some bullshit story about how he found it, but I knew he'd stolen it.

969
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Even my punishing him did little to correct his behavior.

970
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.000
I've been a fighter in my entire life, so I understand putting myself at risk.

971
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:36.000
But hoxon was always putting himself at risk in situations that were not rational or intelligent.

972
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:40.000
This trait had always been with him. He was very young.

973
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
When he was very young hoxon once said to his sister, I'm either going to be rich in prison or dead.

974
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Can you imagine a kid saying that? He was drawn like a magnet to trouble that he could easily could have avoided.

975
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:59.000
This imbalance concerned me because it took hoxon out of a zone of comfort and put him constantly on the edge.

976
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I was not just watching another aggressive gracy growing up. I was watching someone with an unbalanced mental approach to life.

977
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:13.000
When Kim tried to reign him in, he became rebellious and defiant toward her. This caused strife between Kim and me because she did not want her kids to be gracy brawlers.

978
02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
She'd hope that the move to America would put them on a different track, but it was too late.

979
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Hoxon was already on a self-guided mission to be the greatest gracy of his generation.

980
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Reckless yes, but forever a fighter.

981
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
Then we get to early 1993.

982
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Hooray and's dream of bringing Valetudo fighting to America to showcase Gigiitsu was about to come true.

983
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:52.000
He asked me to meet with him and his student Hollywood director John Millius and told me that they had backers for the ultimate fighting championships.

984
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:55.000
The first U.S. Olympics, America's first Valetudo event.

985
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Finally an opportunity for me to make a name for myself in America.

986
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
This was the opportunity that I moved to the United States for and now it was a reality.

987
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:10.000
When Hooray and told me that he wanted our younger brother Hoist to fight in the first tournament and keep me as a backup in case he lost.

988
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000
I was disappointed.

989
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:22.000
So there you go. The first U.S.C. Yes. You must have thought that you were going to be the guy.

990
02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I was sure about that. I was sure I was the one who represents the family and then Hooray and come with the news Hoist will do because if he lost you can come up and back and up and stuff.

991
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I felt a little tricky was a good situation for Hooray and keep things under control.

992
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I took as it is and helped Hoist to fight.

993
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I got a backtrack a little bit. You were going at this time you were teaching up at the before you had your studio you were teaching in the Torrance Garage.

994
02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:03.000
I started, I come here, rent a house, he stopped teaching, my garage, under Hordeos students. He sent me a list of students.

995
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I already flew, we scheduled for teaching, private and garage.

996
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:16.000
Then we left the garage and opened the first academy, Torrance Academy.

997
02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:24.000
I was keeping teaching private lessons, group lessons, helping the whole system of the academy.

998
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
There were some seals that came up and trained with you during that time.

999
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:36.000
There was one of them was an old Vietnam seal, a little guy.

1000
02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I remember him telling me he was going to try these graced guys.

1001
02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Another one was a wrestler, a college wrestler, a champion wrestler, an American, a big guy who is a good friend of mine.

1002
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Apparently, YouTube used to just go at it.

1003
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Yes, definitely.

1004
02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:15.000
I have a very, I did respect about the seals, you know, because, and I also met Steve Watkins, which was also a sergeant at the Konorado Bay, I guess, because he was selecting people.

1005
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:22.000
He was trained for the seals teams to make the selection like the hell weak and stuff.

1006
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:30.000
So I know a little bit about the situations they go through to get graduated as seal.

1007
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:44.000
And I also experienced the practice with them, which emphasizes a lot, because when you get tired, you start to get confused, you start to get doubts, you start to make poor decisions.

1008
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000
Seas they get exhausted and they obey exactly what they hear.

1009
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:54.000
So they don't have, they don't blink or they don't ask or they don't have doubts.

1010
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
They just dare to go, to move forward on the mission.

1011
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
So if the missions keep holding the knee, they will hold the knee and do the pass out.

1012
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:12.000
So our training with them, sometimes are done at the academy, sometimes are in different places, sometimes are on the carpet.

1013
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And they train on the carpet and half hour into the training, they're all bleeding, bleesters and they don't even notice.

1014
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:26.000
And two to three hours rest for an hour, another two to three hours and they go forever.

1015
02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
And if you stop the training, they engage, they fight. And you say, okay, stop.

1016
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:40.000
You jump on the wind. They will stop and jump on the wind. They're too obey what they, so I'm very impressed with their focus, their capacity to,

1017
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:48.000
to completely fear less, completely no doubts, they believe they, they show what they have to.

1018
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:56.000
So it's a very, very special people, you know. And I also hear from my student who are training there.

1019
02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:02.000
In some tests, for example, you have to go diving in a 200 yard pool.

1020
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:08.000
And they say, okay, you go to the other corner. If you don't make it, don't put your head up.

1021
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:14.000
So wherever you do, get to the other end or stand at the water.

1022
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:22.000
And 90% of the guys, they try to go for air when they lose their air because no chance for you to make the other side.

1023
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:30.000
So what they want is make you pass out under the water, conscientiously, say, okay, I'm going to die here, but I'm not going to put my head on the water.

1024
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And when they pass out, they take you off the survival and that's all cool, but your mindset is there to accept death.

1025
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.000
To go into death and not no problem, you don't put your head out.

1026
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.000
So this kind of makes one guy out of 1000.

1027
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:52.000
A guy who's able to accomplish so Navy Seals are guys completely prepared to do what they supposed to do.

1028
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
They have no mind problems, they focus, they is admirable how they can control their own emotions and how they can stand a pressure and be comfortable and do whatever they have to do.

1029
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:12.000
No matter if I'm going that direction, if I'm going my shame, my partner looking backwards,

1030
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.000
or another guy my shame looking my back, so if I start shooting here, he cannot even turn the head.

1031
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:26.000
He have to accept, I'm taking care of my side, so the loyalty, the surrendering, the trust, the courage,

1032
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:34.000
is to the high ceiling, it's just after the roof, so much personal qualities.

1033
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:44.000
It's impossible to make a guy like that can be a champion, can be anything because he control his mind in a very special way.

1034
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.000
The first guy that I trained you, Jitzi Rith, was a guy named Steve Bailey,

1035
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:59.000
and he was probably a mid-level white belt when I met him, and he was another guy thought he was 100 years old.

1036
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000
He was probably about 40 or something like that, but he had trained with you guys.

1037
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Yes, and he was in his house also.

1038
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Down here in San Diego.

1039
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:15.000
We showed up on the point that over in Guam, and he came and said, who here wants to learn how to fight?

1040
02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I was a brand new guy, I was like, hey, I want to learn how to fight, and I also thought to myself, maybe I can teach the old man a little sum,

1041
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:28.000
because I'm pretty bad at myself, I just graduated from steel training, I'm pretty tough.

1042
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:36.80
There's probably five of us that showed up, Jeff Higgs is another one, and we're in Jeff Higgs is a trained with 5% of your

1043
02:10:36.80 --> 02:10:46.80
years of soccer.

1044
02:10:46.80 --> 02:10:53.80
He lined us up and just tapped us all out, and then tapped us all out again, and that was my introduction to Jitzi.

1045
02:10:53.80 --> 02:10:55.80
Then you got hooked.

1046
02:10:55.80 --> 02:10:59.80
Totally hooked, totally hooked.

1047
02:10:59.80 --> 02:11:06.80
Yeah, I didn't want to skip over those early days, because those are pretty legendary days inside the steel teams, and it's so interesting because nobody knew anything.

1048
02:11:06.80 --> 02:11:17.80
I mean, even from that, from what Steve Bailey taught me, I probably got in, I don't know how many skirmishes, like fights, but put tune fights, you know, where you're fighting your friend,

1049
02:11:17.80 --> 02:11:22.80
where you're not going to beat the shit out of them, but you're going to definitely figure out what's up, right?

1050
02:11:22.80 --> 02:11:28.80
I got into all kinds of those things with my friends, and just from what Steve Bailey taught me, like, hey, this is the...

1051
02:11:28.80 --> 02:11:31.80
This is the elbow escape, this is the mount, this is the rear naked choke.

1052
02:11:31.80 --> 02:11:41.80
I think I actually just knew the Americana, the rear naked choke, and like the arm lock, maybe what guard was a little bit a little bit amount.

1053
02:11:41.80 --> 02:11:43.80
That was like enough, back in those days, man.

1054
02:11:43.80 --> 02:11:45.80
You were helping with the world.

1055
02:11:45.80 --> 02:11:47.80
Yeah, King of the World.

1056
02:11:47.80 --> 02:11:52.80
Yes, in the blindsland, who has one eye's the king, right?

1057
02:11:52.80 --> 02:11:58.80
And that's kind of going back to the book, that's kind of how it was for the first UFC.

1058
02:11:58.80 --> 02:11:59.80
Oh, yes.

1059
02:11:59.80 --> 02:12:05.80
It was hoist fighting against people that had no comprehension of GJ2, really.

1060
02:12:05.80 --> 02:12:14.80
Yeah, they coming from different styles, was like, what of styles, you know, kickboxers, sumo wrestlers, and wrestlers.

1061
02:12:14.80 --> 02:12:21.80
But the wrestlers, they have no submission, they have no striking, they are not good completely.

1062
02:12:21.80 --> 02:12:28.80
Today, you see wrestlers, with great striking skills, great guard defenses, and things.

1063
02:12:28.80 --> 02:12:34.80
You see Judo guys, with striking skills, you see striker guys, with Jujitsu skills, and wrestlers.

1064
02:12:34.80 --> 02:12:35.80
So it's a mix.

1065
02:12:35.80 --> 02:12:40.80
But before people represent their own styles, you know, and then becomes a huge difference.

1066
02:12:40.80 --> 02:12:41.80
Yeah.

1067
02:12:41.80 --> 02:12:43.80
If you don't know Jujitsu, you're dead on the wood.

1068
02:12:43.80 --> 02:12:44.80
Yeah, dead.

1069
02:12:44.80 --> 02:12:45.80
I was...

1070
02:12:45.80 --> 02:12:49.80
You say here, so this is the first UFC, after hoist beat the boxer without getting hit,

1071
02:12:49.80 --> 02:12:53.80
then made Ken Shamrock, the fight who posed the biggest threat to him, tap the less than a minute.

1072
02:12:53.80 --> 02:12:58.80
His confidence surfaced in the final hoist face to tall, dead eye, Dutch kickboxer,

1073
02:12:58.80 --> 02:13:05.80
names Juraard Gurdou, Gardo, and stuck the same winning formula when the hoist took him down to the ground.

1074
02:13:05.80 --> 02:13:10.80
And we just about to choke him, Gardo bit hoist's ear after the referee.

1075
02:13:10.80 --> 02:13:14.80
After he freed his ear, hoist choked him, and when he tapped, hoist kept choking,

1076
02:13:14.80 --> 02:13:17.80
and it not stopped until the referee prided him off Gordo.

1077
02:13:17.80 --> 02:13:21.80
I'll tell you what's interesting. I was watching this fight the other day between

1078
02:13:21.80 --> 02:13:26.80
hoists and Ken Shamrock and Ken Shamrock went to do a foot locker heel hook.

1079
02:13:26.80 --> 02:13:28.80
No hesitation whatsoever.

1080
02:13:28.80 --> 02:13:30.80
Totally saw it.

1081
02:13:30.80 --> 02:13:31.80
Desiremed.

1082
02:13:31.80 --> 02:13:37.80
Like, did the perfect defense to it, got up on top, got the position.

1083
02:13:37.80 --> 02:13:42.80
And so people will be like, oh, you know, foot locks are new, right?

1084
02:13:42.80 --> 02:13:44.80
No, it's being around, yeah.

1085
02:13:44.80 --> 02:13:47.80
It's been around because hoist defended that like it was nothing.

1086
02:13:47.80 --> 02:13:48.80
Yes.

1087
02:13:48.80 --> 02:13:51.80
Which is pretty impressive, I think, for 1993.

1088
02:13:51.80 --> 02:13:52.80
Yes.

1089
02:13:52.80 --> 02:13:54.80
Um.

1090
02:13:54.80 --> 02:14:00.40
After hoist won the tournament in less than five minutes of total fighting time, Americans were

1091
02:14:00.40 --> 02:14:03.80
snondered amazed by the power and efficiency of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu overnight.

1092
02:14:03.80 --> 02:14:07.80
Hoist Gracie became the biggest name in martial arts and Gracie Jiu-Jitsu exploded in popularity.

1093
02:14:07.80 --> 02:14:12.80
Horian thought it was hard to control the Gracie's but soon America would be flooded with non-family members.

1094
02:14:12.80 --> 02:14:16.80
Who represented the good, the bad and the ugly of my family's martial art.

1095
02:14:16.80 --> 02:14:20.80
During the 1990s, an unusual thing happened to Brazilians when they flew to the US.

1096
02:14:20.80 --> 02:14:26.80
Some of their belts magically turned from blue to brown or even worse from purple to black.

1097
02:14:26.80 --> 02:14:33.80
And as you just said, in the line to the blind, a one-eyed man is King.

1098
02:14:33.80 --> 02:14:42.80
That was the first UFC's were miraculous for martial arts.

1099
02:14:42.80 --> 02:14:45.80
Yeah, I think it was like an open eye.

1100
02:14:45.80 --> 02:14:47.80
Everybody started to feel something.

1101
02:14:47.80 --> 02:14:55.80
They never felt before was like this mix, this integration of fights and fight people fight differently and engage.

1102
02:14:55.80 --> 02:14:56.80
And they who went.

1103
02:14:56.80 --> 02:15:01.80
So they started to make up different conclusions about what they see on the movies.

1104
02:15:01.80 --> 02:15:04.80
Like Bruce Lee is in stuff.

1105
02:15:04.80 --> 02:15:09.80
So they can kick fights, 40 people and nothing happened.

1106
02:15:09.80 --> 02:15:11.80
And they start to feel like a little different.

1107
02:15:11.80 --> 02:15:16.80
The reality is a little different for the strike and then supposed to be.

1108
02:15:16.80 --> 02:15:22.80
And they start to feel like how impossible is to not engage and not have this kind of tight.

1109
02:15:22.80 --> 02:15:27.80
And once it's tight, it's not easy to separate and risk or mess it.

1110
02:15:27.80 --> 02:15:30.80
If the referee is not there to create this space.

1111
02:15:30.80 --> 02:15:37.80
So in the value of the grappling becomes, you know, people start to get aware of how dangerous it is.

1112
02:15:37.80 --> 02:15:40.80
A grappler is when he's just around your neck.

1113
02:15:40.80 --> 02:15:45.80
And they start to create better techniques and it's a different open mind for everybody.

1114
02:15:45.80 --> 02:15:48.80
Yeah, it's weird because if you look at a striker and a grappler.

1115
02:15:48.80 --> 02:15:50.80
And you don't know anything.

1116
02:15:50.80 --> 02:15:53.80
The striker kind of appears to be more dangerous because they're hitting.

1117
02:15:53.80 --> 02:15:56.80
And especially in the movies you hit them and they fall down.

1118
02:15:56.80 --> 02:15:57.80
And it doesn't.

1119
02:15:57.80 --> 02:15:58.80
Whereas a grappler is like grabbing hold of me.

1120
02:15:58.80 --> 02:15:59.80
I mean, my wife grabs me.

1121
02:15:59.80 --> 02:16:01.80
That can't be a problem, right?

1122
02:16:01.80 --> 02:16:03.80
But the difference is major.

1123
02:16:03.80 --> 02:16:05.80
Oh, yeah.

1124
02:16:05.80 --> 02:16:10.80
So now you start looking to you start looking to fight.

1125
02:16:10.80 --> 02:16:12.80
And you're going to end up in Japan.

1126
02:16:12.80 --> 02:16:16.80
And you say, unlike the UFC that Japan opened had gloves in 20 minute rounds.

1127
02:16:16.80 --> 02:16:18.80
Because it was an eight man tournament.

1128
02:16:18.80 --> 02:16:21.80
The winner would have to fight three belts in one night.

1129
02:16:21.80 --> 02:16:22.80
I would have to keep an open mind.

1130
02:16:22.80 --> 02:16:25.80
I couldn't go in with a strategy or plan because I didn't know who I'd be.

1131
02:16:25.80 --> 02:16:27.80
Who'd be fighting me?

1132
02:16:27.80 --> 02:16:30.80
My solutions to problems had to be reflexive and responsive.

1133
02:16:30.80 --> 02:16:32.80
To me, my fights were solemn celebrations.

1134
02:16:32.80 --> 02:16:37.80
And I wanted my family, friends and students to there to witness the culmination of all the training,

1135
02:16:37.80 --> 02:16:40.80
all the sacrifice, and all the hard work.

1136
02:16:40.80 --> 02:16:42.80
On the morning of the Japan Valley, two to open,

1137
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:45.80
I got to the stadium early and took a long nap in the locker room.

1138
02:16:45.80 --> 02:16:47.80
When I woke up, I thank God for life.

1139
02:16:47.80 --> 02:16:50.80
And then acknowledge that it was a perfect day to die.

1140
02:16:50.80 --> 02:16:53.80
Because of my life's mission was complete.

1141
02:16:53.80 --> 02:16:56.80
I was representing my art and my family and the ring.

1142
02:16:56.80 --> 02:16:59.80
My opponent would have to knock me out or kill me to win.

1143
02:16:59.80 --> 02:17:01.80
For I was never going to tap.

1144
02:17:01.80 --> 02:17:02.80
This was not a sport to me.

1145
02:17:02.80 --> 02:17:04.80
It was my sacred honor.

1146
02:17:07.80 --> 02:17:11.80
And again, I mean, people have to buy the book to read through the details that you give,

1147
02:17:11.80 --> 02:17:14.80
what it was like before the fight, what you were going through.

1148
02:17:14.80 --> 02:17:19.80
And you detail some of the fights themselves and it's fascinating to hear about them from your perspective.

1149
02:17:19.80 --> 02:17:21.80
That's why people have to buy the book.

1150
02:17:21.80 --> 02:17:25.80
Fast forward a little bit and free short outside one of the Japan open.

1151
02:17:25.80 --> 02:17:29.80
I bowed the crowd on the four sides of the ring, but did not smile.

1152
02:17:29.80 --> 02:17:32.80
The samurai did not celebrate victories and neither would I.

1153
02:17:32.80 --> 02:17:33.80
Why celebrate a victory.

1154
02:17:33.80 --> 02:17:37.80
Your next fight might be your last battles or not parties.

1155
02:17:37.80 --> 02:17:40.80
When or lose fights are sacred to me.

1156
02:17:43.80 --> 02:17:47.80
So this is an interesting thing that unfolds here.

1157
02:17:47.80 --> 02:17:53.80
You say when I got back to LA, I learned of that one of Japan's most famous pro wrestlers.

1158
02:17:53.80 --> 02:17:57.80
No buhiko Takata had challenged me.

1159
02:17:57.80 --> 02:18:08.80
A few weeks after we returned, my representative in Japan called me to tell me that Takata was telling the press that I had not responded to him because I was afraid to fight.

1160
02:18:08.80 --> 02:18:14.80
And then a week later, Takata's protege, Yoshi and Joe,

1161
02:18:14.80 --> 02:18:24.80
one of the villains of Japanese pro wrestling had a press conference to announce that he was traveling to Los Angeles to fight me to the death.

1162
02:18:24.80 --> 02:18:30.80
When I heard that Andrew had said this, I told him to call me when he got in the town.

1163
02:18:30.80 --> 02:18:32.80
I wasn't going to stress out about it.

1164
02:18:32.80 --> 02:18:34.80
If Andrew came to fight, then we'd fight.

1165
02:18:34.80 --> 02:18:38.80
The Japanese promoters and reporters were always creating dramas and new fanning the flames.

1166
02:18:38.80 --> 02:18:42.80
These kind of theatrics were the story of my life by then.

1167
02:18:42.80 --> 02:18:46.80
I never lost sleep over the barking dogs.

1168
02:18:46.80 --> 02:18:50.80
And then December 7th comes 1994.

1169
02:18:50.80 --> 02:18:52.80
What happens?

1170
02:18:52.80 --> 02:19:00.80
Yes, I was, I mean, tranquil as always at my house.

1171
02:19:00.80 --> 02:19:04.80
And then my instructor called me from the Academy said, Higgson.

1172
02:19:04.80 --> 02:19:12.80
He has a couple, he's a couple, he's a couple, he wants to talk to you immediately. I imagine could be the fighter.

1173
02:19:12.80 --> 02:19:14.80
He said, okay, I'll be right there.

1174
02:19:14.80 --> 02:19:20.80
As I'm going in the car, I was taping my rear hand a little bit to give me a little support for the bones.

1175
02:19:20.80 --> 02:19:23.80
And setting up the camera my son will film.

1176
02:19:23.80 --> 02:19:26.80
So he was with me in the car.

1177
02:19:26.80 --> 02:19:33.80
So when I arrived in my school, which was in the alley, deep alley, first thing I saw was a van full of Japanese photographers.

1178
02:19:33.80 --> 02:19:39.80
Camera as in the stuff. So I was getting in, I saw the van open doors with Japanese inside.

1179
02:19:39.80 --> 02:19:53.80
So I get through getting to my academy and has this tall guy who is the president of the UFO, the US, the wrestling association in Japan.

1180
02:19:53.80 --> 02:19:55.80
Oh Mr. Grace in Nice Meachum.

1181
02:19:55.80 --> 02:20:01.80
I like I'm here to talk to you. I said yes.

1182
02:20:01.80 --> 02:20:12.80
You said you, I like to invite you for a fight in Japan. I said, man, I told you already, I'm not going to fight in the UFO because you guys are not legit.

1183
02:20:12.80 --> 02:20:17.80
You know, no matter if I win or lose in your arena, can be always fixed.

1184
02:20:17.80 --> 02:20:20.80
So I have no intention to fight in your arena.

1185
02:20:20.80 --> 02:20:25.80
Yeah, but you also said Mr. Grace, you will need to fight for your honor for free.

1186
02:20:25.80 --> 02:20:31.80
Said yes, that's what I'm here for. I thought you're going to fight me, but I saw you not here for fight.

1187
02:20:31.80 --> 02:20:38.80
Yeah, but the fighter is here, isn't it backyard? Outside, he can come. So okay, so call him.

1188
02:20:38.80 --> 02:20:45.80
And as I saw the guy go out to pick up the fighter, I said for the student who was in there said, hey man, you stand the door.

1189
02:20:45.80 --> 02:20:50.80
Let the guy come back, let the fighter come in, but don't let the press come in.

1190
02:20:50.80 --> 02:20:59.80
So keep the press outside. Okay, so the guy, the guy, the president came in, the angel came in, the door was locked.

1191
02:20:59.80 --> 02:21:06.80
And I said, Luis, get on the waver please and give for Mr. Anjou sign, because the waver is always a good secure.

1192
02:21:06.80 --> 02:21:11.80
If you get hurt or something, it's a waver, right? Everybody signs waver here.

1193
02:21:11.80 --> 02:21:16.80
And then the angel looked the waver with a ugly face and talked with the Japanese with the guy.

1194
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:24.80
I'm not little. And the guy said to me, Mr. Gracie, you mean if you don't sign the waver, you're not going to fight.

1195
02:21:24.80 --> 02:21:30.80
Immediately, I felt like, was a tricky question because if I say no, he has to sign, it's okay.

1196
02:21:30.80 --> 02:21:36.80
Let's leave then. So he will leave and he will talk wherever he says. Oh, he quit. I was here.

1197
02:21:36.80 --> 02:21:42.80
Said no, no, forget the paper. Throw this paper out. You want to fight without the paper. Just you welcome.

1198
02:21:42.80 --> 02:21:47.80
Let's fight without the paper. Forget the paper. And then he jumping the ring.

1199
02:21:47.80 --> 02:21:52.80
We start to base with each other. How big is how big is the angel?

1200
02:21:52.80 --> 02:21:59.80
It's about 200 pounds. My, my height, little stocky solid.

1201
02:21:59.80 --> 02:22:04.80
And what do you think when you looked at his eyes? What do you look like?

1202
02:22:04.80 --> 02:22:10.80
He was surprised that you accepted this? No, I felt like he was, he was playing a villain in wrestling.

1203
02:22:10.80 --> 02:22:18.80
So he has the ugly face, the attitude, he don't flake, he don't blink, he don't show emotions. He's just like ready to go.

1204
02:22:18.80 --> 02:22:23.80
You know, I don't know if he was pretending or if he's for sure, but he was ready to go.

1205
02:22:23.80 --> 02:22:28.80
And, and the, all these reporters, none of them came in. No, none came in.

1206
02:22:28.80 --> 02:22:31.80
I didn't let nobody come in because I don't know what's going to happen.

1207
02:22:31.80 --> 02:22:37.80
I don't like somebody which is not my end. Not my friend to, to record everything.

1208
02:22:37.80 --> 02:22:42.80
But, but you're sound recorded. Yes, so, was life, was the camera was on.

1209
02:22:42.80 --> 02:22:48.80
So, and then the fight starts, I felt like he wants to punch me.

1210
02:22:48.80 --> 02:22:53.80
I can feel the difference in distance and the way when you're looking for a position for a punch,

1211
02:22:53.80 --> 02:22:56.80
when you grappler, when you strike, when you want to kick.

1212
02:22:56.80 --> 02:23:02.80
So, depending on approach, I can see if you're more like a kicker, if you're more like a puncher, if you want to grapple.

1213
02:23:02.80 --> 02:23:07.80
And, I felt like he wants to have your hands on my face. You know, he wants to just solid punch.

1214
02:23:07.80 --> 02:23:11.80
And, I did the same thing. I played a little dummy when he came with the right.

1215
02:23:11.80 --> 02:23:20.80
I deflected grab him under the waist, throw him on the floor, we fall off the mat on this hard wood.

1216
02:23:20.80 --> 02:23:25.80
And, he got caught like in a little fancy. So, he got caught in a bad position.

1217
02:23:25.80 --> 02:23:33.80
And, I started to punch him punch and he was... Turn back. He turned back to me.

1218
02:23:33.80 --> 02:23:40.80
And, I was thinking, if I put him to sleep, he can wake up and tell whatever he want to say.

1219
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:46.80
So, has to be bigger than that, has to be a punishment. His face has to show.

1220
02:23:46.80 --> 02:23:52.80
So, I was hitting him backwards on his back and to face me again.

1221
02:23:52.80 --> 02:23:59.80
So, I didn't show him. I waited for him to turn face me again. And then I keep punch and I broke his nose, a lot of blood.

1222
02:23:59.80 --> 02:24:06.80
And then he turned back again and I put him to sleep. Finally, I could make the tank and make a happen.

1223
02:24:06.80 --> 02:24:12.80
So, I put him to sleep and he was passing out facing down on the mat.

1224
02:24:12.80 --> 02:24:17.80
So, when he's a result, I tell the guys, okay, now he's the press can come.

1225
02:24:17.80 --> 02:24:27.80
So, when the press coming to the place, it's not to picture everything. He was already standing up and the guy tried to cover his face with his...

1226
02:24:27.80 --> 02:24:32.80
He's hugging him like, protect his face from the photographers.

1227
02:24:32.80 --> 02:24:43.80
And then Kim said, oh, let's get it. So, show his face. So, the guy moved out and the guy's taking pictures of the guy all bloody and...

1228
02:24:43.80 --> 02:24:51.80
And they left. Two days later, Angel come back to my school. We forgive to him for some of my helmet.

1229
02:24:51.80 --> 02:25:00.80
And said, was dishonor why he did, was a lack of respect, but he's apologizing. He has no problems.

1230
02:25:00.80 --> 02:25:08.80
He was very, very straight forward, give me the gift and said he's respect me and left.

1231
02:25:08.80 --> 02:25:17.80
And then one week after he stayed in Japan, he was jump into the fight. They jumped me, they...

1232
02:25:17.80 --> 02:25:22.80
So, he was like a villain. He talked one face with me, other face in Japan.

1233
02:25:22.80 --> 02:25:31.80
And at this point, I have a tape, fortunately. So, my guy coming to here to US, I give the tape to him.

1234
02:25:31.80 --> 02:25:36.80
He was able to show the tape to the press in Japan, no make no copies and bring back to me.

1235
02:25:36.80 --> 02:25:45.80
So, he showed the press, so my name in Japan was even bigger because everything Angel said was a lie.

1236
02:25:45.80 --> 02:25:49.80
And it was proved wrong. And so, that's happening.

1237
02:25:49.80 --> 02:25:54.80
And then eventually, I fought one more time in Japan.

1238
02:25:54.80 --> 02:26:01.80
And then after I fought Nuburi Kutakada, which was the boss of the Association.

1239
02:26:01.80 --> 02:26:08.80
And a big event in Tokyo, down 70,000 people sold out arena was a huge event.

1240
02:26:08.80 --> 02:26:15.80
That was against Takara, who was like Yoji's master, right?

1241
02:26:15.80 --> 02:26:22.80
Yeah, he was the number one off the roof, the rest. I think Angel was better than Takada as a fighter.

1242
02:26:22.80 --> 02:26:28.80
He came in with a better fighting background. But he was the villain. He always never going to be the number one.

1243
02:26:28.80 --> 02:26:34.80
You know, Takada has a better, pretty look, he has more like, he's a pure more for the audience.

1244
02:26:34.80 --> 02:26:41.80
So, he was the good guy who always win in the end. And the fix fight, you can arrange that with no problems.

1245
02:26:41.80 --> 02:26:44.80
Fan.

1246
02:26:44.80 --> 02:26:46.80
That video is still not released.

1247
02:26:46.80 --> 02:26:51.80
No, only for friends. You're going to be one for sure going to see a copy.

1248
02:26:51.80 --> 02:26:55.80
Yeah. I've been ready to see that for a long time.

1249
02:26:55.80 --> 02:27:04.80
Meanwhile, there's still life going on outside of fighting. So you got all this stuff going on.

1250
02:27:04.80 --> 02:27:09.80
And I pulled this one out. It says, one day, a policeman who knew me called and said,

1251
02:27:09.80 --> 02:27:12.80
I have hocks in here. We called him trying to steal from a store.

1252
02:27:12.80 --> 02:27:16.80
You need to come down. When I arrived, my son was sitting on the curb.

1253
02:27:16.80 --> 02:27:21.80
Hicks and I'm not going to take him in the cops said, but talk to him. He could have gotten in some serious trouble.

1254
02:27:21.80 --> 02:27:25.80
When I lectured hocks and on the drive home about how it was wrong to steal and that he didn't need to do it.

1255
02:27:25.80 --> 02:27:29.80
In order to prove his worth, he remained silent and stared at his feet.

1256
02:27:29.80 --> 02:27:35.80
When we got home, I said, go to the garage. I'm not finished talking to you. He looked me dead in the eyes and groaned.

1257
02:27:35.80 --> 02:27:38.80
Dad, can't you just hit me? I'd rather you do that than more talking.

1258
02:27:38.80 --> 02:27:41.80
We don't need to talk anymore. Just give me my punishment.

1259
02:27:41.80 --> 02:27:46.80
I thought, fuck, what am I going to do to make him fear the consequences of his actions?

1260
02:27:46.80 --> 02:27:55.80
That was when I realized I was losing control of my son. Hicks reminded me of my brother holes in that they both possessed psychologists that made me uncomfortable.

1261
02:27:55.80 --> 02:28:01.80
But while this worried me, I figured that it was a phase he would pass through as I had.

1262
02:28:01.80 --> 02:28:08.80
When I returned to Japan in 1995 a few weeks before the tournament, I went to Yuri, Nakamura's Mountain Cabin.

1263
02:28:08.80 --> 02:28:11.80
My pre-freight routine was the same.

1264
02:28:11.80 --> 02:28:16.80
Again, this is all stuff that you detail. You've talked about what you're thinking about.

1265
02:28:16.80 --> 02:28:20.80
Psychologically, it's so interesting to read the book and get that side of the fight.

1266
02:28:20.80 --> 02:28:24.80
That's why people got to get the book.

1267
02:28:24.80 --> 02:28:30.80
You had these fights that you talk about. You hurt your neck a little bit.

1268
02:28:30.80 --> 02:28:36.80
Then you submit a couple of guys. You end up in that classic fight against Yuki Nakai.

1269
02:28:36.80 --> 02:28:41.80
Who had had his eye gouged in his first fight against Gordo.

1270
02:28:41.80 --> 02:28:42.80
Yes.

1271
02:28:42.80 --> 02:28:46.80
He ended up becoming blind in that eye because of that eye gouging.

1272
02:28:46.80 --> 02:28:47.80
Yes.

1273
02:28:47.80 --> 02:28:50.80
He's also, you can kind of a small little guy.

1274
02:28:50.80 --> 02:28:53.80
Yes, he's a brave warrior for sure.

1275
02:28:53.80 --> 02:28:55.80
Have a lot of respect for the guy.

1276
02:28:55.80 --> 02:28:58.80
But you went out and it's clear when you watched that fight,

1277
02:28:58.80 --> 02:29:05.80
I remember watching it actually that you and out and basically didn't do any further damage to the guy.

1278
02:29:05.80 --> 02:29:10.80
Yes. And you have my friends, my guys and the and the projects and the locker room.

1279
02:29:10.80 --> 02:29:13.80
They said, you have to kill him, punch him, start to damage him.

1280
02:29:13.80 --> 02:29:16.80
Whatever you have a chance to say, no, man, I'm not going to do anything.

1281
02:29:16.80 --> 02:29:19.80
I'm about a technician than him. I'm bigger than him.

1282
02:29:19.80 --> 02:29:22.80
I don't have to be hurt him. He's already hurt.

1283
02:29:22.80 --> 02:29:25.80
I mean, why are you going to be just mean?

1284
02:29:25.80 --> 02:29:28.80
But I'm going to win him with techniques.

1285
02:29:28.80 --> 02:29:33.80
So I went to the ring commit to do my thing and prove myself.

1286
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:39.80
I can win without the brutality, without the fear, the aggressiveness, which I don't need for that.

1287
02:29:39.80 --> 02:29:45.80
So I was calmly putting him in uncomfortable situations until get the choke.

1288
02:29:45.80 --> 02:29:54.80
And this plays a very important role because I always admire Japan.

1289
02:29:54.80 --> 02:30:01.80
I always felt like I live my personal bushyde, which is my moral code, my code of warrior.

1290
02:30:01.80 --> 02:30:08.80
And I never knew details about Japan, very details.

1291
02:30:08.80 --> 02:30:17.80
But I know after the fact I used white, it represents a lot for them because the summer I dressed

1292
02:30:17.80 --> 02:30:26.80
white before the armor, you know, in terms of surrounding, it's a beautiful war collar, the white.

1293
02:30:26.80 --> 02:30:33.80
I didn't know that. The fact I'm not celebrating fights is the same thing than Samurai.

1294
02:30:33.80 --> 02:30:38.80
Samurai, I'm not going to be party because he killed Sambari. Next week, next day can be him.

1295
02:30:38.80 --> 02:30:46.80
So the fighting is just a way to a way to a life, which cannot be celebrated at like a party.

1296
02:30:46.80 --> 02:30:53.80
So the Japanese also noticed this because in Japan different than US or in different places.

1297
02:30:53.80 --> 02:30:58.80
When the fight starts, you don't see nothing. You don't hear anything. The crowd is all quiet.

1298
02:30:58.80 --> 02:31:04.80
And when you do a move, they all follow the fight with precision, with details.

1299
02:31:04.80 --> 02:31:12.80
They admire not only the fight, but also the personality, how they can relate to you, your attitude, your character.

1300
02:31:12.80 --> 02:31:21.80
So when I'm not celebrating you, in a case, defeat, show some respect, show some attitude.

1301
02:31:21.80 --> 02:31:28.80
And the fact I was not meant to him, also they noticed. They say, he didn't punch the guy, they supposed to.

1302
02:31:28.80 --> 02:31:43.80
So they noticed the fact I was nice. I was serious for battle, but not overpowering, not trying to be a coward and hit him or hurt him in a bad way.

1303
02:31:43.80 --> 02:31:55.80
So all those videos that I had to my profile in Japan, because they noticed all those details. And they feel like I was the expression of a new samurai, you know, because I was not bringing back to Japan.

1304
02:31:55.80 --> 02:32:02.80
Like I thank you them for, because at the first tournament I said, I like to thank you Japan to bring in Rijitsu to Brazil.

1305
02:32:02.80 --> 02:32:09.80
And now I'm bringing back because I feel like it's my way to give back to Japan.

1306
02:32:09.80 --> 02:32:18.80
So all this translates to me become some kind of expression of what some what I suppose to be today.

1307
02:32:18.80 --> 02:32:27.80
You know, Japan has a big problem with security state of mind, because once they lost the war, the kindness becomes some kind of fear.

1308
02:32:27.80 --> 02:32:38.80
So they smile at you, they bow to you, but sometimes they don't like you at all. And they show that kind of code image of respect of,

1309
02:32:38.80 --> 02:32:47.80
but eventually they become your enemies. So Japanese lost their soul when they lost the war.

1310
02:32:47.80 --> 02:33:00.80
The attitude of samurai's proud and so they lost their swords, they lost their attitude. So they become more like servers and complying with the energy of the rest of the universe.

1311
02:33:00.80 --> 02:33:18.80
So my image brought somehow some kind of example of how the modern samurai suppose to act. No swords but attitude the way I speak the way you know, sometimes they prior the fights they have like a day oppressed day.

1312
02:33:18.80 --> 02:33:28.80
And then we have 30 different magazines for 20 minutes interviews, always coming in the room and doing quick interviews, some pictures and they live.

1313
02:33:28.80 --> 02:33:36.80
And so some guys coming from very important magazines. One of them coming to me and said, Mr. Grace, I just have one question.

1314
02:33:36.80 --> 02:33:40.80
How you do to fight a polar bear?

1315
02:33:40.80 --> 02:33:46.80
I do not laugh on that question, I don't say anything, I just thought what the question is that.

1316
02:33:46.80 --> 02:33:55.80
And I answer to him without losing my my pace, I said, man, I never intend to fight a polar bear. It's not my go.

1317
02:33:55.80 --> 02:34:08.80
But if I have to fight one, I'm going to have a nice jacket for the winter, I'm going to have a lot of meat, a bear meat on my freeze and I'm going to have a nice necklace of bears too.

1318
02:34:08.80 --> 02:34:13.80
So with that answer, I show him I'm not afraid of the outcome.

1319
02:34:13.80 --> 02:34:19.80
I don't blink in front of my, so he's, I don't expect anything like that.

1320
02:34:19.80 --> 02:34:31.80
I'm so he they left. So just to see how his mind works, Japanese is very special in terms of, they have a samurai helmet, almost like a scent on the altar.

1321
02:34:31.80 --> 02:34:44.80
You know, they have the katanas. Like an example, the god for them comes from like a bushido life of time, have to have honor and dignity integrity.

1322
02:34:44.80 --> 02:34:53.80
So when they see me, they see me like as a new samurai, they bring the kids, can you touch touch his face, please can you touch his head.

1323
02:34:53.80 --> 02:34:59.80
Things like you don't believe it happens and you say, okay, sure.

1324
02:34:59.80 --> 02:35:13.80
So Japanese becomes very much delighted with my, my knowledge of martial arts, my ideas of how to deal with my opponents, how to deal with my peace of mind, emotional control and so on.

1325
02:35:13.80 --> 02:35:18.80
So was, was something very interesting, my spirit is in Japan.

1326
02:35:18.80 --> 02:35:25.80
Now that's, that's a little bit, correct me if I'm wrong, but in the movie choke, right?

1327
02:35:25.80 --> 02:35:31.80
When you're dealing with this, you know you have UK Nikai coming up and you're basically telling,

1328
02:35:31.80 --> 02:35:37.80
Hoyler, hey listen, I'm not going to hit him, you know, I'm going to be, I'm going to be as, do his little damage as I can.

1329
02:35:37.80 --> 02:35:39.80
And Hoyler's like fuck that.

1330
02:35:39.80 --> 02:35:44.80
He's going to be trying to kill you. He's going to be trying to kill you. It's a really good contrast for you.

1331
02:35:44.80 --> 02:35:47.80
You're able to overcome that and may take that samurai spirit.

1332
02:35:47.80 --> 02:35:51.80
Yes, I mean, Hoyler is a great guy, he's very tough.

1333
02:35:51.80 --> 02:35:56.80
And because he was not too big, I've always, life, he was a smaller guy.

1334
02:35:56.80 --> 02:36:01.80
So people, they disrespect, Hoyler and a different way, they disrespect me.

1335
02:36:01.80 --> 02:36:05.80
Forget you, Gitsu, forget Grace and family, but they look at me, they don't want to problem with me.

1336
02:36:05.80 --> 02:36:09.80
They look at Hoyler and say hey man, get out of the, so they have no respect.

1337
02:36:09.80 --> 02:36:15.80
So Hoyler is always on his toes, laughing nothing past because he's a warrior.

1338
02:36:15.80 --> 02:36:17.80
And he don't want to be disrespected.

1339
02:36:17.80 --> 02:36:21.80
So any glimpse of lack of respect he becomes agitated.

1340
02:36:21.80 --> 02:36:25.80
So one day we left the academy to serve.

1341
02:36:25.80 --> 02:36:30.80
Suf boards on top, traffic in Brazil, traffic jam.

1342
02:36:30.80 --> 02:36:33.80
And somehow I cut off a tax driver.

1343
02:36:33.80 --> 02:36:37.80
I make him stay in the heat, not a horn.

1344
02:36:37.80 --> 02:36:41.80
And then he get on my side.

1345
02:36:41.80 --> 02:36:45.80
And he called me, names, you might have had a sad,

1346
02:36:45.80 --> 02:36:47.80
and I immediately say hey man, I'm sorry brother.

1347
02:36:47.80 --> 02:36:49.80
Sorry bro.

1348
02:36:49.80 --> 02:36:55.80
And then Hoyler look at you, he said he's on the guy call you this, this and that.

1349
02:36:55.80 --> 02:36:59.80
How you cannot apologize for the guy, why didn't kick his ass?

1350
02:36:59.80 --> 02:37:02.80
I said Hoyler, can we imagine the hell this guy living?

1351
02:37:02.80 --> 02:37:06.80
Just being on traffic crazy like that?

1352
02:37:06.80 --> 02:37:09.80
Can we imagine we going to surf now?

1353
02:37:09.80 --> 02:37:13.80
Can we imagine just coming from the school, training, sparring, kicking ass,

1354
02:37:13.80 --> 02:37:14.80
training hard?

1355
02:37:14.80 --> 02:37:20.80
You think I'm going to fight this guy, he's old, he's fed, he's all a shape just because he

1356
02:37:20.80 --> 02:37:25.80
call me a name, I have to beat him up, come on Hoyler, forgive this guy.

1357
02:37:25.80 --> 02:37:28.80
Let him go, let his let life beat him.

1358
02:37:28.80 --> 02:37:30.80
He's already a poor guy.

1359
02:37:30.80 --> 02:37:34.80
And Hoyler told me up today said he's on that message for me,

1360
02:37:34.80 --> 02:37:39.80
was hitting me on the heart because nothing can be more.

1361
02:37:39.80 --> 02:37:42.80
You know, I never expect this from you.

1362
02:37:42.80 --> 02:37:47.80
And once you tell me that, I start to redo my life and see how much people I can

1363
02:37:47.80 --> 02:37:51.80
forgive and how much cow might can be if I don't have to prove, I know I can beat the guy,

1364
02:37:51.80 --> 02:37:55.80
but I don't have to just prove every time, just because you asked me for.

1365
02:37:55.80 --> 02:37:59.80
And that's kind of message, Hoyler never forgot anymore.

1366
02:37:59.80 --> 02:38:09.80
So you end up fighting Dakota once and then you fight him again.

1367
02:38:09.80 --> 02:38:11.80
Do you beat him?

1368
02:38:11.80 --> 02:38:13.80
I think you beat him by armlock both times.

1369
02:38:13.80 --> 02:38:14.80
Yeah, both times.

1370
02:38:14.80 --> 02:38:18.80
That's why as they say, Hicks and by armlock.

1371
02:38:18.80 --> 02:38:33.80
Going back to the book here.

1372
02:38:33.80 --> 02:38:35.80
This is 2000.

1373
02:38:35.80 --> 02:38:38.80
Earlier that year, Hicks and injured his knee while training.

1374
02:38:38.80 --> 02:38:42.80
It was slow to heal and I think he felt his dream of becoming a champion fighter,

1375
02:38:42.80 --> 02:38:43.80
slipping away.

1376
02:38:43.80 --> 02:38:47.80
While I was in Rio, there were rumors going around that Hicks and was a perspective member of

1377
02:38:47.80 --> 02:38:50.80
an LA street gang.

1378
02:38:50.80 --> 02:38:54.80
By the time I returned to Los Angeles, Hicks and was getting ready to leave for New York

1379
02:38:54.80 --> 02:38:57.80
with his Brazilian girlfriend.

1380
02:38:57.80 --> 02:39:02.80
After Hicks and left for the East Coast, I received a message from him that he had made it to New York

1381
02:39:02.80 --> 02:39:05.80
and that everything was going well.

1382
02:39:05.80 --> 02:39:09.80
When we didn't hear from him for over a month, I wasn't worried because he was still using his

1383
02:39:09.80 --> 02:39:12.80
ATM card in New York City.

1384
02:39:12.80 --> 02:39:16.80
A month later, December turned into January.

1385
02:39:16.80 --> 02:39:20.80
And we still had not heard from him.

1386
02:39:20.80 --> 02:39:23.80
Now I was truly worried.

1387
02:39:23.80 --> 02:39:27.80
My cousin Henzou's academy was in New York City and some of his students were policemen,

1388
02:39:27.80 --> 02:39:31.80
so I asked Henzou if he could try to find my son.

1389
02:39:31.80 --> 02:39:37.80
A few days later, a shake and Henzou called and told me that an officer had found a photograph

1390
02:39:37.80 --> 02:39:45.80
of an unidentified corpse at the corner's office with a tattoo that read Hicks and Gracie.

1391
02:39:45.80 --> 02:39:52.80
Number one dad.

1392
02:39:52.80 --> 02:39:56.80
Up to this point, Hicks and had been a missing person.

1393
02:39:56.80 --> 02:39:59.80
This was the confirmation that he was gone.

1394
02:39:59.80 --> 02:40:04.80
After I hung up the phone, the whole family melted into tears.

1395
02:40:04.80 --> 02:40:08.80
Kim seemed to beside me looked hopeless.

1396
02:40:08.80 --> 02:40:14.80
I told the kids that Hicks and had moved onto another life and was now with holes.

1397
02:40:14.80 --> 02:40:23.80
Now, representing the Gracie family, I had to go to New York City for the physical confirmation.

1398
02:40:23.80 --> 02:40:44.80
I knew in my heart that my son was dead.

1399
02:40:44.80 --> 02:40:48.80
You talking this section here.

1400
02:40:48.80 --> 02:40:55.80
Obviously, I don't think there's anybody that thinks there's anything worse than losing a child.

1401
02:40:55.80 --> 02:41:09.80
You talk about what you did, what you thought and how you had to get through this.

1402
02:41:09.80 --> 02:41:17.80
Some of the lessons that you had to learn and some of the things that you had to do, you ended up

1403
02:41:17.80 --> 02:41:23.80
building like a tree house.

1404
02:41:23.80 --> 02:41:27.80
Yes, kind of plata form of the tree.

1405
02:41:27.80 --> 02:41:32.80
And that was sort of your escape, but it was an escape, but it ended up sort of being a reconnection.

1406
02:41:32.80 --> 02:41:42.80
Definitely, I felt like up to that point, my life was being just a very beautiful ride.

1407
02:41:42.80 --> 02:41:50.80
Even with the pressure, even with the doubts, I have always been in charge of my own desires.

1408
02:41:50.80 --> 02:41:53.80
I was thinking I was controlling time.

1409
02:41:53.80 --> 02:41:59.80
I have a perfect family, kids, loving friends and training.

1410
02:41:59.80 --> 02:42:04.80
My life was perfect, and I was thinking I was in charge.

1411
02:42:04.80 --> 02:42:09.80
When Hawkson departure, I felt like the floor just get out of my feet.

1412
02:42:09.80 --> 02:42:16.80
I was just lost track of, I lose the desire to serve, I lose the desire to train, to teach.

1413
02:42:16.80 --> 02:42:21.80
You know, I was a little on social, a little bit.

1414
02:42:21.80 --> 02:42:25.80
You know, I was not saving tears, I was crying a lot.

1415
02:42:25.80 --> 02:42:36.80
I was, I let myself get down to the hole in a way to embrace a rock and go to the lake and go deep on the bottom of the lake.

1416
02:42:36.80 --> 02:42:42.80
And I allowed myself to get deeper enough to know, to feel important.

1417
02:42:42.80 --> 02:42:52.80
And also, from that lower point, decide, if I want to kill myself, if I want to drink drugs, give up from, I don't know.

1418
02:42:52.80 --> 02:43:01.80
I was just allowed myself to get weak enough and fragile enough to, from that point, see what's happened.

1419
02:43:01.80 --> 02:43:12.80
And once I get to that bottom, I decide to make, I wasn't in the, in the, he was silent, my house, I was there just.

1420
02:43:12.80 --> 02:43:23.80
And I was climbing some trees and then I saw a beautiful tree with a beautiful ocean view, said, I want to create a platform here to talk with Hawkson.

1421
02:43:23.80 --> 02:43:38.80
So for about three weeks, from first light on this, first light to dawn, I was working on this project from designing, to buying the wood, to buying the, the screws and then,

1422
02:43:38.80 --> 02:43:45.80
and bringing the electrical to make the holes and stuff and just focus on this, my hands are kind of bleeding so much working.

1423
02:43:45.80 --> 02:43:56.80
So I'm making focus on creating that kind of platform. And after that platform, done, took me almost three weeks.

1424
02:43:56.80 --> 02:44:03.80
I would make amazing job, put the wood and put the vernish so it was beautiful.

1425
02:44:03.80 --> 02:44:09.80
I felt like was a mission accomplished there. I said, now I make my three-boot to you.

1426
02:44:09.80 --> 02:44:20.80
So I want to be in peace. And it was a better feeling for me to make this because anytime I miss Hawkson, I was going up there, light up an incense,

1427
02:44:20.80 --> 02:44:26.80
made it take a little bit thinking about good things, I have a picture there.

1428
02:44:26.80 --> 02:44:34.80
And I spent, maybe a year more and a much better vibration, but not exactly out of the hole.

1429
02:44:34.80 --> 02:44:45.80
And one day I was thinking up there, and I remember what my dad said about nothing can be a hundred percent wrong or bad.

1430
02:44:45.80 --> 02:44:52.80
Nothing can be a hundred percent right or good. It's always a duo I expect in everything.

1431
02:44:52.80 --> 02:44:59.80
And I started thinking, what's going to be that advantage of Hawkson's departure? How, how this can be good in any way?

1432
02:44:59.80 --> 02:45:13.80
I started looking for a reason. And then I find something very important, which was up to Hawkson's departure, I was in charge.

1433
02:45:13.80 --> 02:45:19.80
If he or anyone else, something, he or he or he could teach me today, dad, can you take me to the beach?

1434
02:45:19.80 --> 02:45:26.80
Whatever it is, I can say no, not today, let's go tomorrow. Let's leave this. Not today, I don't feel good.

1435
02:45:26.80 --> 02:45:35.80
So I was thinking about being in charge of the time, and in a much more powerful way than I was than I have.

1436
02:45:35.80 --> 02:45:42.80
So after his departure, I'm sure tomorrow may never happen.

1437
02:45:42.80 --> 02:45:49.80
So based on that difference, I started using my day much more efficiently.

1438
02:45:49.80 --> 02:45:58.80
To give you an example, I could be down in the freeway to fight in Japan or to make a big program in Japan.

1439
02:45:58.80 --> 02:46:03.80
I'm in the freeway, if my daughter called me, dad, I have to talk to you, she's crying.

1440
02:46:03.80 --> 02:46:08.80
I will stop the car in the freeway and talk to her, what's the problem?

1441
02:46:08.80 --> 02:46:19.80
Well, this index, so it has solved the result. So I will talk to her and to be able to give my best opinion, my best information, give my time as long as it takes.

1442
02:46:19.80 --> 02:46:22.80
After this finish, I turn off the phone.

1443
02:46:22.80 --> 02:46:35.80
I will see if I still have time to go to Japan, if I still have time to get the flight to whatever, if not, I will reschedule, I will do because today, I cannot do this for tomorrow.

1444
02:46:35.80 --> 02:46:51.80
So I learn effectively how to use my time with precision, with not wasting time, with things are not matter or not give you the value of time, which time is very valuable.

1445
02:46:51.80 --> 02:47:05.80
And I start to become more effective on how to use my time, how the purpose of my life, my service, what is really matters for me, and I start to use my day much more worth it.

1446
02:47:05.80 --> 02:47:18.80
From a conversation like that today, from a teaching I student, from talking with my family, I will be much more precise, I want to be much more on time, much more.

1447
02:47:18.80 --> 02:47:37.80
You know, with no loose ends or no gaps, it's just tight. So by doing that, I re-born. I reinvent myself and a different me, with much more compassion, much more interested for things, much more ways to bring you to others.

1448
02:47:37.80 --> 02:47:54.80
I'm still at service, so being happy with that, make me feel like I have to thank you, Hox, for his departure, in order for me to achieve that kind of enlightenment, that kind of depth on my being alive and being at service.

1449
02:47:54.80 --> 02:48:07.80
If I was not for that, I could be a lot of loose gaps up today and having my mind in a different matter. So I saw the positiveness of his departure, I have given me the chance to become a better man.

1450
02:48:07.80 --> 02:48:23.80
So I'm thankful and away, he taught me that with his departure. So I compensated a little being from that on, I become fully restored my energy levels, my happiness, my desire to live my life and let Hox on.

1451
02:48:23.80 --> 02:48:30.80
Being peace in heaven and we know if Halls and waiting for us, dancing and happy.

1452
02:48:30.80 --> 02:48:52.80
Yeah, that's, I've had that conversation with myself quite a few times. I've lost some very close people to me, and I've actually had that discussion with many other people, as they lose

1453
02:48:52.80 --> 02:49:01.80
lose their loved ones and they will, people have literally asked me, you know, what possibly, what possible good can there be from this?

1454
02:49:01.80 --> 02:49:12.80
There's nothing good, this is horrible. And like you did, you have to kind of pull back and look at things from a different perspective and there always is something positive.

1455
02:49:12.80 --> 02:49:17.80
There always is a lesson to be learned and there always is the memories that you get to keep.

1456
02:49:17.80 --> 02:49:32.80
And obviously this, this had an impact on the rest of your family. You say here, losing Hox and put Kron on the path to martial arts greatness.

1457
02:49:32.80 --> 02:49:38.80
On some level, I think Hox and knew that Kron had the natural talent and tools to be even better than he.

1458
02:49:38.80 --> 02:49:46.80
Like all my kids, he had trained you to do all of his life, but was never as interested as Hox and now it was his turn to shine.

1459
02:49:46.80 --> 02:49:54.80
Even though they were brothers, Hox and Kron were completely different, Hox and was emotional and tense and intent on proving himself a greasy warrior.

1460
02:49:54.80 --> 02:50:00.80
Kron was more observant, analytical and calm. He wanted to do the right things and always be at his best.

1461
02:50:00.80 --> 02:50:10.80
In one of their last conversations, Hox and told Kron that he was a Gracie and to give 110% and never quit and whatever it was that he chose to do.

1462
02:50:10.80 --> 02:50:20.80
After Hox and died, Kron took that to heart and was now on a mission to become the next apex predator in the Gracie food chain.

1463
02:50:20.80 --> 02:50:28.80
You say here, the more Kron won, the less attached he became to winning.

1464
02:50:28.80 --> 02:50:34.80
After he realized that the outcome of fight does not define you as a person he improved by leaps and bounds.

1465
02:50:34.80 --> 02:50:48.80
He trained as hard as humanly possible and when he competed he let the chips fall where they may. When loser draw he would be back in the academy on Monday and train as if the fight had never happened.

1466
02:50:48.80 --> 02:50:55.80
When my father died in his sleep in 2009 at the age of 95, I was in Europe with Kron for the European Gejitsu Championship.

1467
02:50:55.80 --> 02:51:02.80
We received the news, the day of the tournament and knew that we could not get back to Brazil for the funeral.

1468
02:51:02.80 --> 02:51:08.80
Instead we went back to our hotel room and held our own memorial. We cried and shared memories.

1469
02:51:08.80 --> 02:51:28.80
The day Ali O'Died Kron represented his grandfather on the mat as Ali O'Woonaflight. He won both of his matches by submission and after he won the European title he kissed the picture of Hox and that always as always and bowed to the giant mural of Ali O'Woonaflight.

1470
02:51:28.80 --> 02:51:44.80
He was a beautiful moment for both of us. Ali O'Woonaflight's legacies were now being carried and upheld by a third generation.

1471
02:51:44.80 --> 02:51:50.80
That's the family tradition.

1472
02:51:50.80 --> 02:52:00.80
Again, in the book you carry on and talk about some of the other things that preceded after that.

1473
02:52:00.80 --> 02:52:06.80
I want to get a little bit, go towards the end of the book here.

1474
02:52:06.80 --> 02:52:12.80
You've talked about this a little bit today, but I think it's important to reiterate.

1475
02:52:12.80 --> 02:52:18.80
My goal today is to create a form of Chijitsu that will empower the entire person both on and off the mat.

1476
02:52:18.80 --> 02:52:22.80
If I can never make a nervous person feel more relaxed than they've ever felt before,

1477
02:52:22.80 --> 02:52:28.80
I'm changing them from within in a way that a psychiatrist or a pill never can.

1478
02:52:28.80 --> 02:52:36.80
Today, conflict comes in many forms and physicality is only one aspect of it.

1479
02:52:36.80 --> 02:52:42.80
Conflict follows humans wherever they go and people adopt different strategies to cope with it.

1480
02:52:42.80 --> 02:52:52.80
Modern enemies can strike in attacks in email or in a social media post. As the world of instant communication has evolved many negative unintended consequences have evolved with it.

1481
02:52:52.80 --> 02:52:59.80
Fifty years ago, a ten-year-old boy winning his room only this sleep because he spent all day outside playing.

1482
02:52:59.80 --> 02:53:05.80
Today, if parents aren't careful, their children will spend the entire day alone in their rooms.

1483
02:53:05.80 --> 02:53:15.80
We cannot dismiss technology, but why let us turn us into brains with vegetable bodies.

1484
02:53:15.80 --> 02:53:20.80
One of the worst side effects of technology is the way it is reduced human direct interaction.

1485
02:53:20.80 --> 02:53:30.80
Because people can get almost everything they desire, food, entertainment, friendships, sex, via the screen, they have gotten to the point of being scared of face-to-face interaction.

1486
02:53:30.80 --> 02:53:39.80
There are so many wonderful things that are impossible to experience on a screen, jumping into a cold river, making the drop on a big wave, and walking in the rain or just a few.

1487
02:53:39.80 --> 02:53:47.80
Even worse, social media provides an arena for cowards to lurk in the cyber shadows and say things that they would never dare say in person.

1488
02:53:47.80 --> 02:53:57.80
Mike Tyson put it best when he said that social media has made people quote way too comfortable with disrespecting people and not getting punched in the face for it.

1489
02:53:57.80 --> 02:54:01.80
Today, I try to use jujitsu as a tool to teach patients.

1490
02:54:01.80 --> 02:54:09.80
Hope, strategy, emotional control, breathing, and many other things, all without conflict and competition.

1491
02:54:09.80 --> 02:54:18.80
This allows those who need it most to learn the visible and invisible aspects of the art in ways that could help them in their everyday lives.

1492
02:54:18.80 --> 02:54:26.80
I have developed the training routine where in students learn the practice, learn and practice all the movements and techniques of jujitsu.

1493
02:54:26.80 --> 02:54:37.80
In a cooperative, instead of competitive environment, I can teach the most critical, invisible aspects of jujitsu, like bass, timing, weight distribution, and connection with little stress.

1494
02:54:37.80 --> 02:54:43.80
In this type of class, I can have two beginners blocking punches and doing hip throws.

1495
02:54:43.80 --> 02:54:48.80
Your training partner is there to help, not to fight you.

1496
02:54:48.80 --> 02:54:51.80
So that's what you were talking about earlier today.

1497
02:54:51.80 --> 02:54:52.80
Yes.

1498
02:54:52.80 --> 02:55:03.80
I felt like we all in warfare, it's not about being a soldier, it's not about being a fighter.

1499
02:55:03.80 --> 02:55:11.80
We are under stress, our lives today are driving in different modes and different aspects.

1500
02:55:11.80 --> 02:55:16.80
So what you really need to conquer is happiness.

1501
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:33.80
Your biggest achievement is to focus on how to be happy, how to bring your family to the best scenario, how to bring your job, how to bring your assets, how to bring your...

1502
02:55:33.80 --> 02:55:35.80
The way you practice, your physical.

1503
02:55:35.80 --> 02:55:42.80
So you want to conquer a lot of things, a lot of things should be conquered, in order for you to be happy.

1504
02:55:42.80 --> 02:55:51.80
And in order for you to be happy, I don't believe in luck, I don't believe you, you're going to be happy just by close your eyes.

1505
02:55:51.80 --> 02:56:03.80
And if you happy to day, ten years from now, what make you happy today, either evolve or doesn't make no sense it, it's not going to make you happy.

1506
02:56:03.80 --> 02:56:11.80
You have a different goals. Every time you just have a different first by a car, then by a house, then get married.

1507
02:56:11.80 --> 02:56:17.80
Whatever it is, it's not a step to make you happy or to make you in a good position.

1508
02:56:17.80 --> 02:56:28.80
And I see those kind of challenges, those kind of obstacles, as little barrels, which when you focus, when you have the capacity,

1509
02:56:28.80 --> 02:56:36.80
the strategic capacity, when you have emotional control, when you have believing in yourself, when you have hope.

1510
02:56:36.80 --> 02:56:45.80
So a lot of elements on the water, two bucks has to be used for daily practice, for average jose.

1511
02:56:45.80 --> 02:56:50.80
It's not about being a special water and being able to have emotional control.

1512
02:56:50.80 --> 02:56:55.80
It's for the weak ones, for the guy who has an email and going to lose his rent or whatever.

1513
02:56:55.80 --> 02:57:00.80
So this guy needs emotional control, as they say, my need, the same you need.

1514
02:57:00.80 --> 02:57:10.80
So the idea of empower people cannot come in with, I will empower you, but you have to prove you can handle.

1515
02:57:10.80 --> 02:57:16.80
Sometimes, the guy don't have, I don't have what it needs, I don't have what it needs to be at fighter.

1516
02:57:16.80 --> 02:57:24.80
But he loves to learn details for self defense. He loves to learn details for self emotional control to breathing.

1517
02:57:24.80 --> 02:57:30.80
He loves to understand what's the solution for that problem, what's the solution for that.

1518
02:57:30.80 --> 02:57:35.80
So based on information, based on practice, he may never fight nobody.

1519
02:57:35.80 --> 02:57:45.80
But that's who we incorporate on his behavior, a completely different mindset, a completely different way to breathe and rebounds the distress,

1520
02:57:45.80 --> 02:57:51.80
a completely different way for you to feel good about a possible engagement.

1521
02:57:51.80 --> 02:58:00.80
So sometimes I train in my students to keep the distance, not in, not in, not in, not in, but keep just stay away from my punch.

1522
02:58:00.80 --> 02:58:10.80
So I will try to keep, so based on your space, you can survive, you see people in the UFC surviving in attack, basically moving away.

1523
02:58:10.80 --> 02:58:15.80
So if you just move away, you don't have to be a fighter to survive.

1524
02:58:15.80 --> 02:58:27.80
So I put you a expert and not getting punch, that's already a big asset in your life, if you ever do, you make sure you know if I'm going to punch in the face, so it's a big win already.

1525
02:58:27.80 --> 02:58:40.80
So my purpose with that knowledge is to prepare people to win without a fight, based on different components, mental components, spirit or components and physical components.

1526
02:58:40.80 --> 02:58:45.80
Okay, man, you don't have to prove me, you just have to believe you have a chance.

1527
02:58:45.80 --> 02:58:56.80
So by giving that chance for I ever Joe, I want to empower the world in a different and a very special way because I will offer them what they need to become more humanized,

1528
02:58:56.80 --> 02:59:05.80
to become more sharp, to become better, in control, to become more strategically correct, which makes life different.

1529
02:59:05.80 --> 02:59:14.80
If you tell me what's the successful people has in common, all the successful people have few things in common.

1530
02:59:14.80 --> 02:59:24.80
They all love what they do. They all capable, to pass obstacles and not give up easy.

1531
02:59:24.80 --> 02:59:39.80
They all capable also to become, to make decisions under pressure.

1532
02:59:39.80 --> 02:59:52.80
They all able to keep learning, keep progressing, keep taking, so they have open mind about how to strategize the house, the new game coming.

1533
02:59:52.80 --> 03:00:02.80
So they not, they not unfamiliar with behaviors and situations, which everybody successful has in common.

1534
03:00:02.80 --> 03:00:07.80
So give you those tools, give you the glimpse of what you need to become successful.

1535
03:00:07.80 --> 03:00:15.80
If you have to believe in what you do, you have to practice, you have to make sure the strategies correct and so on.

1536
03:00:15.80 --> 03:00:29.80
So based on those elements, I cannot transform people from a coward guy to make him a courageous, but I can make a coward guy becomes tall and enough to believe he has a chance.

1537
03:00:29.80 --> 03:00:34.80
And that's can transform his decisions and a courageous decisions.

1538
03:00:34.80 --> 03:00:49.80
So because we live in a life of pretending, because we live in a life of images and look good and so I like to take you from, you looking from the mirror for you start to feeling.

1539
03:00:49.80 --> 03:00:58.80
So when you start to feel yourself in that, you start to understand your breathing, understand your leverage and understand your base.

1540
03:00:58.80 --> 03:01:07.80
Completely changed the dynamic you de-handle the word, the way you shake your hand, the way you approach somebody, looking in the eye and things like that.

1541
03:01:07.80 --> 03:01:20.80
So that kind of jujitsu can favors anyone in the globe, different than I specialize jujitsu for competition, which favors just the waters, one of favorites, trujitsu.

1542
03:01:20.80 --> 03:01:39.80
Yeah, that's, you know, you were talking about what is successful people having common, they get, they can, they have an open mind, they overcon obstacles, they use the right strategies at the right times, they're comfortable in these uncomfortable positions and situations and these are all things that you can learn if you're a good.

1543
03:01:39.80 --> 03:01:52.80
Yes, of course, because I met a form for life, you know, the same situation you have to become enough and breathe and put your hand and start working leverage instead brutality.

1544
03:01:52.80 --> 03:02:08.80
Same thinking life, you get any any any problems, you have to have the same articulated mindset to just survive or escape or control whatever it is, it's all about making quick changes and start to become focus and the purpose.

1545
03:02:08.80 --> 03:02:20.80
You know, I'm going to read one last little section from the book, we're almost at three hours right now, so I'm going to read one little last section from the book.

1546
03:02:20.80 --> 03:02:38.80
Go fast when we enjoy and it does. I could sit here all day, you say this, on my best day now, I'm only 5% of what I once was as a fighter. However, my invisible power transcends my physicality and will be part of me until the day I die.

1547
03:02:38.80 --> 03:02:53.80
That is why for me, jujitsu is about much more than fighting. It is a tool to teach people about themselves. It is great to see it become so popular and provide lucrative businesses for so many, but this has nothing to do with what I teach.

1548
03:02:53.80 --> 03:03:09.80
Of my students 98% trained two or three days a week trying to perfect basic techniques and then testing them on a level playing field. Helping my students try to become better people, not just smashing machines is what motivates me.

1549
03:03:09.80 --> 03:03:24.80
Jujitsu is my philosophy, my sacred honor and my family tradition. It is made me strong enough to forgive and confident enough to fight for my beliefs.

1550
03:03:24.80 --> 03:03:34.80
Just outstanding.

1551
03:03:34.80 --> 03:03:50.80
Jujitsu is life. Yes. Before you go, once again, this book is called Breathe, a life in flow. It is by Hicks and Gracie with Peter McGuire who has actually become a friend of mine.

1552
03:03:50.80 --> 03:04:04.80
I know he is a friend of yours and a great guy, a surfer, a jujitsu practitioner, a scholar. So I look forward to working with him some more.

1553
03:04:04.80 --> 03:04:22.80
So the way that you are spreading the word now, you have Hicks and Dot Academy. Yes. That is where you do online training. I watch some of the videos. You are going to get people are going to get such good details out of what you are saying.

1554
03:04:22.80 --> 03:04:40.80
Sometimes I think it be impossible for someone to explain how you put pressure and how you stabilize Hicks and how you move Hicks. But when you watch those videos, you start to understand you do have the ability to explain what you are doing.

1555
03:04:40.80 --> 03:04:52.80
Because Jujitsu is about feeling. It is not about seeing or understanding. You have to feel. And I like to approach Jujitsu and away. I have to make you feel.

1556
03:04:52.80 --> 03:05:06.80
When you relax, when you just about angles, just about details, invisible details, who translates and a deep effectiveness. So I don't start to seeking to show me what you have.

1557
03:05:06.80 --> 03:05:22.80
I try to make you take you off your elements, relax and put you in a way for you to understand and feel the weak vision. The vision of the weak one into the approach.

1558
03:05:22.80 --> 03:05:28.80
Because if you feel like you can fight as a weak person, imagine if you put the muscles you have on.

1559
03:05:28.80 --> 03:05:38.80
If I change around and start to use and explore the muscles you have on, you may never go to perceive the death of what I want to show you.

1560
03:05:38.80 --> 03:05:54.80
So my father always says, when he is training somebody and he stops up, you two dance, be relaxed, loosen up. If I am not, I cannot fight because he was just seeking to give you the information which goes into your gut feeling.

1561
03:05:54.80 --> 03:06:00.80
Wow, I never felt like that difference can change so much in effectiveness.

1562
03:06:00.80 --> 03:06:04.80
And by feeling that, you start to feel like it's a different element to be added.

1563
03:06:04.80 --> 03:06:12.80
Wherever you have, if you're strong, if you fast, if you compare all these are qualities, personal qualities.

1564
03:06:12.80 --> 03:06:20.80
But the death of the knowledge we try to pass to you transcends all this.

1565
03:06:20.80 --> 03:06:28.80
So you able to not only explain for a weak person, but to also to, in case somebody with 300 pounds solid muscle,

1566
03:06:28.80 --> 03:06:32.80
you have the chance to deal with them in a different natural, comfortable situation.

1567
03:06:32.80 --> 03:06:43.80
So it's amazing how much that kind of sensorial feeling can add to your capacity to, to mental capacity to experience,

1568
03:06:43.80 --> 03:06:46.80
to all capacity and to also to your physicality.

1569
03:06:46.80 --> 03:06:52.80
So that's, that's Hickson Academy. Hickson. Academy is how you get there.

1570
03:06:52.80 --> 03:07:00.80
Great stuff on there. You have Hickson Gracie.com is sort of where you can buy, you can read some history stuff,

1571
03:07:00.80 --> 03:07:07.80
but you got a store on there. And then on Facebook, your Hickson at Hickson Gracie and on Instagram,

1572
03:07:07.80 --> 03:07:11.80
which you have a bunch of cool little clips on Instagram too.

1573
03:07:11.80 --> 03:07:16.80
And that's Hickson Gracie, JJ.

1574
03:07:16.80 --> 03:07:18.80
Echo, you got anything?

1575
03:07:18.80 --> 03:07:24.80
I have many things, but in the spirit of saving sometime, I have one question.

1576
03:07:24.80 --> 03:07:28.80
So you know the first UFC one, they took one, Hory and chose Hose.

1577
03:07:28.80 --> 03:07:31.80
Did he tell you why he chose Hose rather than you?

1578
03:07:31.80 --> 03:07:37.80
Yeah, his answer was, I want to put Hose because in case something happened with him,

1579
03:07:37.80 --> 03:07:41.80
we always have a bigger bullet to put it on.

1580
03:07:41.80 --> 03:07:47.80
But in reality, he has control over Hose. He did have control over me.

1581
03:07:47.80 --> 03:07:53.80
I was already working on Peek-o-Bulevar. I was already my own, you know, have my own school.

1582
03:07:53.80 --> 03:08:00.80
So in order for him to have control of not only the fighter in there,

1583
03:08:00.80 --> 03:08:05.80
but still with the best brand was better for him to have Hose.

1584
03:08:05.80 --> 03:08:09.80
They said that I think might have been like in the documentary,

1585
03:08:09.80 --> 03:08:15.80
whatever they were like, he wanted to kind of display you Jitsu with someone who was less physical,

1586
03:08:15.80 --> 03:08:17.80
less, you know, bigger whatever that way.

1587
03:08:17.80 --> 03:08:22.80
It would display you Jitsu a little bit better because if you went in and you're like this more athletic,

1588
03:08:22.80 --> 03:08:26.80
either were like, oh well he's more of an athlete, so it doesn't really highlight the Jitsu part of it.

1589
03:08:26.80 --> 03:08:33.80
Yeah, I disagree with that because for me and Hory between me and him are only 10 pounds difference.

1590
03:08:33.80 --> 03:08:41.80
So I felt like he was able to even even the first payment for the UFC.

1591
03:08:41.80 --> 03:08:47.80
He holds, Hose supposed to get a 50,000 check and I supposed to get 5,000 from Hose's.

1592
03:08:47.80 --> 03:08:52.80
I still waiting because he didn't pay Hose. He didn't pay Hose, he didn't pay me.

1593
03:08:52.80 --> 03:08:58.80
So he was just put it pure love for us and he was a businessman.

1594
03:08:58.80 --> 03:09:00.80
So he knows better what he's doing.

1595
03:09:00.80 --> 03:09:08.80
I kind of disagree with that statement, if Hose was smaller and look fragile, Hose was tough to.

1596
03:09:08.80 --> 03:09:11.80
I've trained with Hose. He's not small. He's not fragile.

1597
03:09:11.80 --> 03:09:13.80
That's for danger.

1598
03:09:13.80 --> 03:09:15.80
Yes.

1599
03:09:15.80 --> 03:09:17.80
Yeah, thank you. Good to see you.

1600
03:09:17.80 --> 03:09:20.80
Hicks and any closing thoughts?

1601
03:09:20.80 --> 03:09:29.80
First thank you. You were such a spiring warrior and having, you know, you helping me on the book and

1602
03:09:29.80 --> 03:09:33.80
and get me in your podcast is already a blast.

1603
03:09:33.80 --> 03:09:38.80
Second, man, I feel like we are in the same business of empowerment.

1604
03:09:38.80 --> 03:09:44.80
You know, you, you're bringing your knowledge, your expertise to help people in terms of

1605
03:09:44.80 --> 03:09:51.80
understand pressure and understand discomfort, to understand victory and understand, you know, bravery.

1606
03:09:51.80 --> 03:09:59.80
And I'm in the same business, which empowers people and give them better chance to handle life, which is not easy those days.

1607
03:09:59.80 --> 03:10:05.80
So it's a pleasure to talk to you. It's a pleasure to see the energy which is similar.

1608
03:10:05.80 --> 03:10:10.80
And we are in the same mode of supporting the future generations.

1609
03:10:10.80 --> 03:10:16.80
You know, with your expertise, with my expertise. So it's just a great day on the office and

1610
03:10:16.80 --> 03:10:22.80
I'm happy to say, you know, this book may be helping a lot of people.

1611
03:10:22.80 --> 03:10:31.80
And this book is just the idea. My, it's my personal life is not something which has the intention to make you copy or

1612
03:10:31.80 --> 03:10:33.80
or be what is in the book.

1613
03:10:33.80 --> 03:10:42.80
But creates a, creates a venue for different discussions, creates a venue for different seminars, different speeches and

1614
03:10:42.80 --> 03:10:47.80
everything coming from that because in essence, we all need to use more loving our hearts.

1615
03:10:47.80 --> 03:10:53.80
We all need to use more techniques to victory.

1616
03:10:53.80 --> 03:10:56.80
You know, nothing comes for in luck.

1617
03:10:56.80 --> 03:11:00.80
Nothing is just act of God.

1618
03:11:00.80 --> 03:11:05.80
I feel like you have to represent yourself in terms of have God been inside you and

1619
03:11:05.80 --> 03:11:13.80
bringing the best service to make people get benefits from it. So thank you, true.

1620
03:11:13.80 --> 03:11:17.80
Well, thank you. Thanks to your whole family.

1621
03:11:17.80 --> 03:11:25.80
I guess especially your uncle and to your father who created this incredible martial art brought it to the world.

1622
03:11:25.80 --> 03:11:32.80
And, and like you've been saying, it's not just, it's not just to help people fight better, but actually to live better.

1623
03:11:32.80 --> 03:11:44.80
I've just had such a huge impact on my life and I can say without hesitation that my life would not be even close to where it is if it wasn't for you, for your family and for

1624
03:11:44.80 --> 03:11:47.80
your jiu-jitsu. So it's an honor to know you.

1625
03:11:47.80 --> 03:11:55.80
It's not an atonct you and I will continue to do my best to spread the art that your family and you taught to me.

1626
03:11:55.80 --> 03:11:57.80
Thank you, my brother. Thank you, Uncle.

1627
03:11:57.80 --> 03:12:00.80
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1628
03:12:00.80 --> 03:12:02.80
And with that,

1629
03:12:02.80 --> 03:12:05.80
Hicks and Gracie has left the building.

1630
03:12:05.80 --> 03:12:12.80
Only after he did spend a few minutes talking about invisible jiu-jitsu and, you know, showing me some stuff.

1631
03:12:12.80 --> 03:12:13.80
Yeah.

1632
03:12:13.80 --> 03:12:15.80
You were hit. Did you hit record?

1633
03:12:15.80 --> 03:12:16.80
You were you?

1634
03:12:16.80 --> 03:12:17.80
You videoed a little a little.

1635
03:12:17.80 --> 03:12:18.80
A little bit.

1636
03:12:18.80 --> 03:12:18.80
Yeah.

1637
03:12:18.80 --> 03:12:19.80
Yeah.

1638
03:12:19.80 --> 03:12:21.80
It's weird. So he talks about this thing called invisible jiu-jitsu.

1639
03:12:21.80 --> 03:12:23.80
We didn't really talk about today,

1640
03:12:23.80 --> 03:12:24.80
but

1641
03:12:24.80 --> 03:12:30.80
it's a thing and I know it's a thing because, you know, when you're showing a move, like, let's say I'm showing a move with you.

1642
03:12:30.80 --> 03:12:37.80
And I'm talking to, so I'm using you as a dummy and I'm talking to the group of students, right?

1643
03:12:37.80 --> 03:12:44.80
And I say, well, you can't really see what I'm doing here to the students, but I'm like, echo, do you feel this?

1644
03:12:44.80 --> 03:12:50.80
And I, it feels one way and then I go, now feel this and no one can tell anything different, but you go, yeah,

1645
03:12:50.80 --> 03:12:54.80
and it feels a lot heavier, it feels a lot like I'm off balance and it feels a lot more stable.

1646
03:12:54.80 --> 03:12:57.80
So there's things in jiu-jitsu that are invisible.

1647
03:12:57.80 --> 03:12:59.80
And obviously, there's a hardest thing to teach.

1648
03:12:59.80 --> 03:13:05.80
Well, Hixon, that sort of Hixon's thing is he's got the things that you cannot see, but they're real.

1649
03:13:05.80 --> 03:13:07.80
They're invisible, but they're real.

1650
03:13:07.80 --> 03:13:12.80
And like I was trying to explain, he talks about some of those on Hixon dot academy.

1651
03:13:12.80 --> 03:13:16.80
He starts to go into details of those things and he can explain it.

1652
03:13:16.80 --> 03:13:24.80
Yeah. So, and just when he was explaining it to me and I will say, you know, he's doing it to me and I'm like, well, that is freaking awesome.

1653
03:13:24.80 --> 03:13:25.80
Yeah.

1654
03:13:25.80 --> 03:13:25.80
Right?

1655
03:13:25.80 --> 03:13:26.80
Yeah.

1656
03:13:26.80 --> 03:13:35.80
And you just is so dynamic, even if you don't see it, where doing it versus not doing it is night and day when you're in there.

1657
03:13:35.80 --> 03:13:41.80
You know, so like even like the thing was that you're essentially controlling your base, right?

1658
03:13:41.80 --> 03:13:46.80
You controlling your base versus not controlling your base in that way.

1659
03:13:46.80 --> 03:13:54.80
When you go up against somebody and they have to contend with you controlling your base in that way versus not is, but it's going to be a completely different scenario for them.

1660
03:13:54.80 --> 03:13:55.80
Different experience.

1661
03:13:55.80 --> 03:14:02.80
When I grabbed the single on him and he was like, you know, go ahead and I started like trying to get a little, little uppity with that thing.

1662
03:14:02.80 --> 03:14:03.80
Yeah.

1663
03:14:03.80 --> 03:14:05.80
And I couldn't move him.

1664
03:14:05.80 --> 03:14:10.80
And I was, you know, I'm starting to think, I'm, I'm actually, I mean, we did it for 20 seconds, right?

1665
03:14:10.80 --> 03:14:12.80
And in my mind, I was like, I'm working right now.

1666
03:14:12.80 --> 03:14:13.80
That's what I was thinking.

1667
03:14:13.80 --> 03:14:14.80
I was like, I'm working.

1668
03:14:14.80 --> 03:14:16.80
I'm trying to pull this thing and he's not working.

1669
03:14:16.80 --> 03:14:20.80
He's just, he's just using invisible digital versus me.

1670
03:14:20.80 --> 03:14:24.80
And it's, it's going to wear me out and you can't even see it.

1671
03:14:24.80 --> 03:14:29.80
But you before you came in when he started, he, you could see he kind of wanted to show me some stuff.

1672
03:14:29.80 --> 03:14:35.80
And he goes, he'll stand here and, you know, start with it.

1673
03:14:35.80 --> 03:14:39.80
And he just like stand here and he started doing like some basic steps.

1674
03:14:39.80 --> 03:14:41.80
I started doing like some basic self defense with me.

1675
03:14:41.80 --> 03:14:44.80
And I was like, okay, you know, cool, you know, I'm thinking, of course, what am I thinking?

1676
03:14:44.80 --> 03:14:45.80
I'm arrogant.

1677
03:14:45.80 --> 03:14:46.80
I have a big ego, right?

1678
03:14:46.80 --> 03:14:47.80
I gotta know this.

1679
03:14:47.80 --> 03:14:48.80
And he goes, okay, now do this.

1680
03:14:48.80 --> 03:14:49.80
And I was like, okay.

1681
03:14:49.80 --> 03:14:55.80
And he's basically, he pushes me and I like, immediately get my base, right?

1682
03:14:55.80 --> 03:14:58.80
You know, my, put my foot back again into a fight stance.

1683
03:14:58.80 --> 03:14:59.80
And he goes, okay.

1684
03:14:59.80 --> 03:15:01.80
Well, that's, okay, right?

1685
03:15:01.80 --> 03:15:04.80
And he says, now do this and he teaches me a little invisible digital.

1686
03:15:04.80 --> 03:15:07.80
And he now he pushes me again and I don't go anywhere.

1687
03:15:07.80 --> 03:15:09.80
Right?

1688
03:15:09.80 --> 03:15:10.80
Mm-hmm.

1689
03:15:10.80 --> 03:15:11.80
That's the due to.

1690
03:15:11.80 --> 03:15:12.80
That's the due to.

1691
03:15:12.80 --> 03:15:19.80
So awesome to have Hicks and on speaking of due to, we're training due to,

1692
03:15:19.80 --> 03:15:22.80
if you're not training due to, obviously, start training due to,

1693
03:15:22.80 --> 03:15:25.80
and when you do that, guess what you're going to need.

1694
03:15:25.80 --> 03:15:26.80
Supplementing.

1695
03:15:26.80 --> 03:15:27.80
Oh, look at you.

1696
03:15:27.80 --> 03:15:28.80
Yeah, we did it.

1697
03:15:28.80 --> 03:15:29.80
It does.

1698
03:15:29.80 --> 03:15:30.80
It does.

1699
03:15:30.80 --> 03:15:31.80
It does.

1700
03:15:31.80 --> 03:15:32.80
It does.

1701
03:15:32.80 --> 03:15:36.80
He did talk about to, uh, actually, I'm not even sure if you talk.

1702
03:15:36.80 --> 03:15:39.80
About it on air.

1703
03:15:39.80 --> 03:15:41.80
Where, you know, when you, a lot of people start duty too,

1704
03:15:41.80 --> 03:15:44.80
and then they, they stop duty, then they stop.

1705
03:15:44.80 --> 03:15:50.80
Because in one of the elements, one of them is that they jump into the competitive,

1706
03:15:50.80 --> 03:15:52.80
the heart of it, the war.

1707
03:15:52.80 --> 03:15:53.80
Yeah, the war.

1708
03:15:53.80 --> 03:15:55.80
And not even necessarily voluntarily.

1709
03:15:55.80 --> 03:15:56.80
Like they'll get the original.

1710
03:15:56.80 --> 03:15:57.80
They'll get to the original.

1711
03:15:57.80 --> 03:15:58.80
Oh, yeah, we're sparring right now.

1712
03:15:58.80 --> 03:15:59.80
Ghost, just go sparring.

1713
03:15:59.80 --> 03:16:01.80
And then they'll come across someone who's, you know,

1714
03:16:01.80 --> 03:16:03.80
intense or whatever.

1715
03:16:03.80 --> 03:16:05.80
And a lot of times, you just become intense just because of the

1716
03:16:05.80 --> 03:16:07.80
unfamiliar nature with what you're doing.

1717
03:16:07.80 --> 03:16:08.80
Because you're human being.

1718
03:16:08.80 --> 03:16:09.80
Yeah.

1719
03:16:09.80 --> 03:16:12.80
It's being escalated on and you're going to escalate back into the ego and all

1720
03:16:12.80 --> 03:16:13.80
nine yards.

1721
03:16:13.80 --> 03:16:13.80
Oh, yeah.

1722
03:16:13.80 --> 03:16:15.80
You know, it's level seven war.

1723
03:16:15.80 --> 03:16:15.80
Yeah.

1724
03:16:15.80 --> 03:16:19.80
And then just, but just even before he gets to war, just that stress.

1725
03:16:19.80 --> 03:16:22.80
It's like some people, they don't want that beef right away.

1726
03:16:22.80 --> 03:16:23.80
Yeah.

1727
03:16:23.80 --> 03:16:24.80
Even if some people, they don't want that beef.

1728
03:16:24.80 --> 03:16:25.80
They just, they want to learn.

1729
03:16:25.80 --> 03:16:29.80
They want to learn and, you know, have kind of a stress-free learning kind of experience.

1730
03:16:29.80 --> 03:16:30.80
Mm-hmm.

1731
03:16:30.80 --> 03:16:32.80
But that's part of that's part of the narrative.

1732
03:16:32.80 --> 03:16:36.80
And I think that's a lot about, you know, because I think we kind of go in down for that beef.

1733
03:16:36.80 --> 03:16:40.80
You know, I, I mentioned surfing as a comparison.

1734
03:16:40.80 --> 03:16:41.80
Um, okay.

1735
03:16:41.80 --> 03:16:47.80
If you're going to start surfing and I take you to Mavericks, which is scary rocks,

1736
03:16:47.80 --> 03:16:50.80
cold water, sharks, giant waves.

1737
03:16:50.80 --> 03:16:52.80
You're not even going to get in the water, bro.

1738
03:16:52.80 --> 03:16:53.80
Yeah.

1739
03:16:53.80 --> 03:16:54.80
You're literally not going to get in the water.

1740
03:16:54.80 --> 03:16:57.80
And I think that's the way a lot of people, unfortunately, view jujitsu.

1741
03:16:57.80 --> 03:16:58.80
Yeah.

1742
03:16:58.80 --> 03:16:59.80
And they're kind of right.

1743
03:16:59.80 --> 03:17:01.80
Because if you go to a lot of schools, guess what's happening day one.

1744
03:17:01.80 --> 03:17:04.80
You're in the big water in the deep water and the cold water with sharks.

1745
03:17:04.80 --> 03:17:05.80
Yeah.

1746
03:17:05.80 --> 03:17:07.80
And you're getting bit just kind of left too.

1747
03:17:07.80 --> 03:17:08.80
Yeah.

1748
03:17:08.80 --> 03:17:14.80
You know, it's a, so that, that man, I, I, I wish I would think about that a little bit more.

1749
03:17:14.80 --> 03:17:15.80
Yeah.

1750
03:17:15.80 --> 03:17:17.80
It's definitely something I think about.

1751
03:17:17.80 --> 03:17:18.80
All right.

1752
03:17:18.80 --> 03:17:22.80
It is good for him to exercise, which is important exercising all capacities.

1753
03:17:22.80 --> 03:17:23.80
Very important.

1754
03:17:23.80 --> 03:17:25.80
And yes, we do need supplementation from time to time.

1755
03:17:25.80 --> 03:17:28.80
I think if it's part of your routine, you're going to be, you're going to be,

1756
03:17:28.80 --> 03:17:31.80
you're going to read way more benefits over time.

1757
03:17:31.80 --> 03:17:33.80
Short and long term, by the way.

1758
03:17:33.80 --> 03:17:36.80
So jockel supplements are jockel fuel.

1759
03:17:36.80 --> 03:17:38.80
Let's start with the energy drinks.

1760
03:17:38.80 --> 03:17:39.80
And that's what it is.

1761
03:17:39.80 --> 03:17:42.80
The god won't discipline go real energy.

1762
03:17:42.80 --> 03:17:42.80
Yep.

1763
03:17:42.80 --> 03:17:43.80
Had one today.

1764
03:17:43.80 --> 03:17:44.80
By the way.

1765
03:17:44.80 --> 03:17:45.80
Actually, I've been carrying on everything.

1766
03:17:45.80 --> 03:17:47.80
I actually kind of down right now.

1767
03:17:47.80 --> 03:17:48.80
Yeah.

1768
03:17:48.80 --> 03:17:49.80
Pretty much every day.

1769
03:17:49.80 --> 03:17:50.80
Mm-hmm.

1770
03:17:50.80 --> 03:17:57.80
You don't have to drink one every day, but that's just, that's just, that's what's written on the screen.

1771
03:17:57.80 --> 03:17:58.80
Yeah.

1772
03:17:58.80 --> 03:17:59.80
Some new flavors out, watermelon and mango passion fruit.

1773
03:17:59.80 --> 03:18:03.80
Mango passion fruit is the best flavor according to some people.

1774
03:18:03.80 --> 03:18:04.80
Yeah.

1775
03:18:04.80 --> 03:18:08.80
Like, well, factually, I think a pretty sure factually is the best flavor.

1776
03:18:08.80 --> 03:18:10.80
So yeah, if you're not, if you didn't know that,

1777
03:18:10.80 --> 03:18:11.80
You know, that's what you mean.

1778
03:18:11.80 --> 03:18:12.80
You might have something to say about that.

1779
03:18:12.80 --> 03:18:15.80
You know, yeah, I would expect that to be the case.

1780
03:18:15.80 --> 03:18:17.80
You might have to open a can of well past.

1781
03:18:17.80 --> 03:18:18.80
So you're a bad person.

1782
03:18:18.80 --> 03:18:20.80
I anticipate that being the case.

1783
03:18:20.80 --> 03:18:21.80
Yes.

1784
03:18:21.80 --> 03:18:22.80
Then the last, yes, new flavors.

1785
03:18:22.80 --> 03:18:24.80
So yes, check those out.

1786
03:18:24.80 --> 03:18:25.80
Let me know what you think.

1787
03:18:25.80 --> 03:18:26.80
Let me go on.

1788
03:18:26.80 --> 03:18:27.80
Did you review so far?

1789
03:18:27.80 --> 03:18:29.80
Anyway, yes, healthy energy, drink.

1790
03:18:29.80 --> 03:18:30.80
That's a equals thing.

1791
03:18:30.80 --> 03:18:31.80
That's a equals flavor, by the way.

1792
03:18:31.80 --> 03:18:32.80
Does everybody knows?

1793
03:18:32.80 --> 03:18:33.80
Oh, good.

1794
03:18:33.80 --> 03:18:34.80
It's not a buy.

1795
03:18:34.80 --> 03:18:36.80
It's not an unbiased judgment.

1796
03:18:36.80 --> 03:18:37.80
It's his favorite.

1797
03:18:37.80 --> 03:18:41.80
His signature flavor, like I said, factual.

1798
03:18:41.80 --> 03:18:42.80
Then the last all healthy.

1799
03:18:42.80 --> 03:18:43.80
All good.

1800
03:18:43.80 --> 03:18:44.80
No bad.

1801
03:18:44.80 --> 03:18:45.80
Drink a bunch of them.

1802
03:18:45.80 --> 03:18:47.80
And you'll be better off.

1803
03:18:47.80 --> 03:18:48.80
Be a better person.

1804
03:18:48.80 --> 03:18:50.80
We also got joint warfare.

1805
03:18:50.80 --> 03:18:52.80
Look, you're doing your jits through your lifting.

1806
03:18:52.80 --> 03:18:53.80
You're running.

1807
03:18:53.80 --> 03:18:55.80
Your joints are going to take a little bit of abuse.

1808
03:18:55.80 --> 03:18:57.80
Joint warfare, krill oil.

1809
03:18:57.80 --> 03:18:59.80
You can just go on to those.

1810
03:18:59.80 --> 03:19:00.80
Just get on them.

1811
03:19:00.80 --> 03:19:01.80
Just get on them.

1812
03:19:01.80 --> 03:19:02.80
And don't look back.

1813
03:19:02.80 --> 03:19:04.80
And if you have to look back, you'll be looking back at sore joints.

1814
03:19:04.80 --> 03:19:05.80

03:19:24.80 --> 03:19:26.80
Don't let that happen to you.

1826
03:19:26.80 --> 03:19:27.80
Discipline powder.

1827
03:19:27.80 --> 03:19:29.80
We got vitamin D3 and called war.

1828
03:19:29.80 --> 03:19:33.80
Those are also just just sort of staples of life.

1829
03:19:33.80 --> 03:19:34.80
Yeah.

1830
03:19:34.80 --> 03:19:35.80
Right.

1831
03:19:35.80 --> 03:19:36.80
Staples of life.

1832
03:19:36.80 --> 03:19:37.80
You're not getting enough D vitamin D.

1833
03:19:37.80 --> 03:19:38.80
It's not happening.

1834
03:19:38.80 --> 03:19:39.80
Get it.

1835
03:19:39.80 --> 03:19:40.80
The proper way.

1836
03:19:40.80 --> 03:19:41.80
Yeah.

1837
03:19:41.80 --> 03:19:43.80
That's one of the things to where you get in the routine.

1838
03:19:43.80 --> 03:19:44.80
You got the subscription all day.

1839
03:19:44.80 --> 03:19:46.80
It's just part of the routine.

1840
03:19:46.80 --> 03:19:48.80
You don't have to worry about those effects anymore.

1841
03:19:48.80 --> 03:19:49.80
That's the big one.

1842
03:19:49.80 --> 03:19:50.80
You don't notice it.

1843
03:19:50.80 --> 03:19:53.80
But it's better to not notice it than to notice when you don't notice it in a good way.

1844
03:19:53.80 --> 03:19:55.80
You're not like damn my knee hurts.

1845
03:19:55.80 --> 03:19:56.80
Damn my elbow hurts.

1846
03:19:56.80 --> 03:19:57.80
You're just going damn.

1847
03:19:57.80 --> 03:19:59.80
I'm looking forward to training today.

1848
03:19:59.80 --> 03:20:00.80
Yes.

1849
03:20:00.80 --> 03:20:01.80
That's what you're getting.

1850
03:20:01.80 --> 03:20:02.80
Yeah.

1851
03:20:02.80 --> 03:20:03.80
Screw.

1852
03:20:03.80 --> 03:20:05.80
If you need a little extra protein, you get yourself some milk.

1853
03:20:05.80 --> 03:20:08.80
I ate two rib-sized steaks last time.

1854
03:20:08.80 --> 03:20:09.80
For dinner.

1855
03:20:09.80 --> 03:20:10.80
That's good.

1856
03:20:10.80 --> 03:20:11.80
And a mom.

1857
03:20:11.80 --> 03:20:13.80
I was going to say and it was a triple milk.

1858
03:20:13.80 --> 03:20:17.80
So here this is a, this is a, this is a, it's not a normal thing for me.

1859
03:20:17.80 --> 03:20:19.80
But I went, I could, you know, start it.

1860
03:20:19.80 --> 03:20:20.80
I was on fast.

1861
03:20:20.80 --> 03:20:22.80
And what do we call it?

1862
03:20:22.80 --> 03:20:24.80
When you, you don't mean to fast incidental fast.

1863
03:20:24.80 --> 03:20:26.80
It's a little, what it was.

1864
03:20:26.80 --> 03:20:27.80
Yeah.

1865
03:20:27.80 --> 03:20:28.80
And it was like man.

1866
03:20:28.80 --> 03:20:29.80
I have incidental fast.

1867
03:20:29.80 --> 03:20:30.80
It was getting kind of late.

1868
03:20:30.80 --> 03:20:32.80
I was like man, I didn't eat anything today.

1869
03:20:32.80 --> 03:20:34.80
So I'm just going one time essentially.

1870
03:20:34.80 --> 03:20:35.80
And it's going to be big.

1871
03:20:35.80 --> 03:20:36.80
I'm going to be big.

1872
03:20:36.80 --> 03:20:37.80
Got it.

1873
03:20:37.80 --> 03:20:38.80
Big.

1874
03:20:38.80 --> 03:20:39.80
So yeah.

1875
03:20:39.80 --> 03:20:40.80
Two rib-sized.

1876
03:20:40.80 --> 03:20:41.80
Brown rice.

1877
03:20:41.80 --> 03:20:42.80
I'll bigger the rib-sized one.

1878
03:20:42.80 --> 03:20:43.80
Okay.

1879
03:20:43.80 --> 03:20:44.80
So there's a big.

1880
03:20:44.80 --> 03:20:45.80
Yeah.

1881
03:20:45.80 --> 03:20:46.80
They're not those thick things.

1882
03:20:46.80 --> 03:20:46.80
Yeah.

1883
03:20:46.80 --> 03:20:47.80
But I know what a regular thing is.

1884
03:20:47.80 --> 03:20:48.80
They say regular I have an image.

1885
03:20:48.80 --> 03:20:49.80
Yes.

1886
03:20:49.80 --> 03:20:52.80
We're talking probably 14 to 16 ounces.

1887
03:20:52.80 --> 03:20:54.80
You know, probably about a pound.

1888
03:20:54.80 --> 03:20:55.80
Yep.

1889
03:20:55.80 --> 03:20:56.80
That's like a regular rib.

1890
03:20:56.80 --> 03:20:57.80
It is very normal person.

1891
03:20:57.80 --> 03:20:58.80
Yes.

1892
03:20:58.80 --> 03:21:00.80
Because my rib eyes are those thick ones.

1893
03:21:00.80 --> 03:21:01.80
Yeah.

1894
03:21:01.80 --> 03:21:02.80
The thick ones are good too.

1895
03:21:02.80 --> 03:21:03.80
But Brad, you think I'm going to eat two of those.

1896
03:21:03.80 --> 03:21:04.80
I don't know.

1897
03:21:04.80 --> 03:21:06.80
You know, I'd have to be pretty hungry.

1898
03:21:06.80 --> 03:21:08.80
But then the triple, what's a triple milk?

1899
03:21:08.80 --> 03:21:09.80
You said it was a triple milk.

1900
03:21:09.80 --> 03:21:12.80
Okay.

1901
03:21:12.80 --> 03:21:13.80
Two big.

1902
03:21:13.80 --> 03:21:15.80
In fact, it was so big the milk was so big.

1903
03:21:15.80 --> 03:21:17.80
My stomach was getting way too big.

1904
03:21:17.80 --> 03:21:18.80
But it was tasting good.

1905
03:21:18.80 --> 03:21:19.80
So I pound it.

1906
03:21:19.80 --> 03:21:20.80
But I didn't get it.

1907
03:21:20.80 --> 03:21:21.80
Where did you mess it?

1908
03:21:21.80 --> 03:21:22.80
Mix it with regular milk.

1909
03:21:22.80 --> 03:21:23.80
Half milk.

1910
03:21:23.80 --> 03:21:24.80
Half almond milk.

1911
03:21:24.80 --> 03:21:25.80
So that's the thing.

1912
03:21:25.80 --> 03:21:26.80
With an annum thing.

1913
03:21:26.80 --> 03:21:30.80
And I got to say, you know, people like think I'm a close-minded about, you know, nutrition

1914
03:21:30.80 --> 03:21:32.80
or I'm close-minded about my habits.

1915
03:21:32.80 --> 03:21:34.80
Because I am a very habitual person.

1916
03:21:34.80 --> 03:21:37.80
But these things that have recently been introduced to me.

1917
03:21:37.80 --> 03:21:38.80
Coconut milk.

1918
03:21:38.80 --> 03:21:40.80
Like almond milk.

1919
03:21:40.80 --> 03:21:42.80
Oh milk.

1920
03:21:42.80 --> 03:21:43.80
Like I've been trying these other milk.

1921
03:21:43.80 --> 03:21:49.80
And what's nice about them is if you get that little lactose, I'm not lactose intolerant

1922
03:21:49.80 --> 03:21:50.80
like strictly.

1923
03:21:50.80 --> 03:21:53.80
But if I drink a whole bunch of milk, let's face it.

1924
03:21:53.80 --> 03:21:54.80
We're not feeling great.

1925
03:21:54.80 --> 03:21:55.80
Might have some effects.

1926
03:21:55.80 --> 03:21:56.80
Yeah.

1927
03:21:56.80 --> 03:22:01.80
So you mix up the milk with the almond milk or coconut milk or whatever kind of other milk

1928
03:22:01.80 --> 03:22:02.80
that's out there.

1929
03:22:02.80 --> 03:22:04.80
You're just, you don't know.

1930
03:22:04.80 --> 03:22:06.80
You don't really know the difference.

1931
03:22:06.80 --> 03:22:08.80
It still just tastes like a freaking dream.

1932
03:22:08.80 --> 03:22:09.80
Yes.

1933
03:22:09.80 --> 03:22:14.80
So the almond milk, obviously there's a plethora of different types of almond milk.

1934
03:22:14.80 --> 03:22:15.80
Sweet, but it's not like it did.

1935
03:22:15.80 --> 03:22:16.80
Like bark milk.

1936
03:22:16.80 --> 03:22:18.80
The way it was.

1937
03:22:18.80 --> 03:22:20.80
The particular one I did was the unsweetened.

1938
03:22:20.80 --> 03:22:22.80
It's super like milk to me.

1939
03:22:22.80 --> 03:22:24.80
Does it doesn't taste sweet at all?

1940
03:22:24.80 --> 03:22:25.80
Milk is not sweet.

1941
03:22:25.80 --> 03:22:26.80
Yeah.

1942
03:22:26.80 --> 03:22:32.80
But apparently it is because unsweetened almond milk is like, whoa, like you can taste the unsweetened.

1943
03:22:32.80 --> 03:22:33.80
I love it.

1944
03:22:33.80 --> 03:22:34.80
So I did a half and a half.

1945
03:22:34.80 --> 03:22:37.80
And but with the milk and the banana, boom.

1946
03:22:37.80 --> 03:22:38.80
You're good.

1947
03:22:38.80 --> 03:22:39.80
Oh yeah.

1948
03:22:39.80 --> 03:22:42.80
It was essentially a dessert.

1949
03:22:42.80 --> 03:22:43.80
And additional product.

1950
03:22:43.80 --> 03:22:44.80
There was like a thousand.

1951
03:22:44.80 --> 03:22:45.80
You're so much pretty.

1952
03:22:45.80 --> 03:22:46.80
Yeah.

1953
03:22:46.80 --> 03:22:47.80
You just feel so good.

1954
03:22:47.80 --> 03:22:48.80
At the brown rice though.

1955
03:22:48.80 --> 03:22:49.80
Why can't you train today?

1956
03:22:49.80 --> 03:22:52.80
I have some prior engagements.

1957
03:22:52.80 --> 03:22:53.80
Okay.

1958
03:22:53.80 --> 03:22:54.80
But why can't you train today?

1959
03:22:54.80 --> 03:22:57.80
Well, maybe if it was later, like it maybe like five.

1960
03:22:57.80 --> 03:22:58.80
Okay.

1961
03:22:58.80 --> 03:22:59.80
Why can't you train today?

1962
03:22:59.80 --> 03:23:00.80
It was bumped out of the surface.

1963
03:23:00.80 --> 03:23:01.80
All right.

1964
03:23:01.80 --> 03:23:03.80
So it realized we train, I mean, I don't know if you thought it was hard.

1965
03:23:03.80 --> 03:23:06.80
But you know, okay, you know, when you get into like a routine,

1966
03:23:06.80 --> 03:23:08.80
working out training,

1967
03:23:08.80 --> 03:23:09.80
you don't feel domes as much.

1968
03:23:09.80 --> 03:23:11.80
You don't feel like everyone's in a while.

1969
03:23:11.80 --> 03:23:12.80
Like I'll have one with Greg.

1970
03:23:12.80 --> 03:23:13.80
Yeah.

1971
03:23:13.80 --> 03:23:17.80
And yesterday was was actually kind of intense one with you.

1972
03:23:17.80 --> 03:23:18.80
Mm-hmm.

1973
03:23:18.80 --> 03:23:20.80
Where the next day, like today when I woke up,

1974
03:23:20.80 --> 03:23:21.80
I was like,

1975
03:23:21.80 --> 03:23:22.80
You had four body downs.

1976
03:23:22.80 --> 03:23:23.80
Four body.

1977
03:23:23.80 --> 03:23:25.80
Like a like I got hit by a truck.

1978
03:23:25.80 --> 03:23:26.80
Like, you didn't roll over.

1979
03:23:26.80 --> 03:23:27.80
You did.

1980
03:23:27.80 --> 03:23:29.80
You know what it was?

1981
03:23:29.80 --> 03:23:31.80
It was that choke that I was trying to defend.

1982
03:23:31.80 --> 03:23:33.80
That you didn't have sunk in, but you had it tight.

1983
03:23:33.80 --> 03:23:34.80
You know, that kind of stuff.

1984
03:23:34.80 --> 03:23:35.80
So you feel like, oh, I can defend,

1985
03:23:35.80 --> 03:23:37.80
but I'm gonna take some heavies on this.

1986
03:23:37.80 --> 03:23:39.80
And I'm like defending trying to build up.

1987
03:23:39.80 --> 03:23:42.80
And then at the end, it's like, all right, it did.

1988
03:23:42.80 --> 03:23:45.80
You know what's bad, but your choke, I'm just gonna say.

1989
03:23:45.80 --> 03:23:48.80
So your choke sinks in and it's tight.

1990
03:23:48.80 --> 03:23:50.80
But you know how most people when they sink in a submission,

1991
03:23:50.80 --> 03:23:52.80
that's not all the way sunk in.

1992
03:23:52.80 --> 03:23:54.80
And then you feel like pushing hard.

1993
03:23:54.80 --> 03:23:56.80
You feel after a few seconds,

1994
03:23:56.80 --> 03:23:58.80
you feel them let up a little bit for some kind of adjustment.

1995
03:23:58.80 --> 03:23:59.80
You know,

1996
03:23:59.80 --> 03:24:04.80
or maybe because you know, you can't keep that intensity on the application for that long.

1997
03:24:04.80 --> 03:24:08.80
You know, so you feel loosening up a little bit and maybe adjust and then go for it again.

1998
03:24:08.80 --> 03:24:11.80
I want to, right here's just gets tighter and harder.

1999
03:24:11.80 --> 03:24:14.80
Like your choke doesn't even get tired.

2000
03:24:14.80 --> 03:24:16.80
And like, oh my god, I'm resisting or he's this in then.

2001
03:24:16.80 --> 03:24:18.80
Yeah, for whatever, finally I get choked.

2002
03:24:18.80 --> 03:24:22.80
So I tap and then like, I'm paying this price for it even after I tap.

2003
03:24:22.80 --> 03:24:24.80
And then I think you choke me again too.

2004
03:24:24.80 --> 03:24:26.80
Anyway, so I'm like, all right, cool.

2005
03:24:26.80 --> 03:24:29.80
And after you train your all loose and you know, warm and stuff,

2006
03:24:29.80 --> 03:24:33.80
but next day else, which is today, by the way, ready?

2007
03:24:33.80 --> 03:24:35.80
Okay, but we got a train.

2008
03:24:35.80 --> 03:24:36.80
All right, well, I'm going to get a train.

2009
03:24:36.80 --> 03:24:40.80
All right, so any of this stuff, you can get it at the vitamin shop.

2010
03:24:40.80 --> 03:24:41.80
You can get it.

2011
03:24:41.80 --> 03:24:42.80
You can get the drinks at walla.

2012
03:24:42.80 --> 03:24:45.80
Wow, wow, it's fully in full support.

2013

2024

Just go get one.

2025
03:25:10.80 --> 03:25:14.80
You know, Hicksman was talking about like, oh, we were had geese before we had diapers.

2026
03:25:14.80 --> 03:25:19.80
Go look at pictures of like the Gracie family when they're all we're just wearing geese.

2027
03:25:19.80 --> 03:25:20.80
It's true.

2028
03:25:20.80 --> 03:25:22.80
It's funny, because I joke about like, hey, you can't just wear a gear around.

2029
03:25:22.80 --> 03:25:30.80
Apparently, if it's 19, whatever, 19, 65, and you're in the Gracie family, you are wearing a geese.

2030
03:25:30.80 --> 03:25:31.80
You are wearing a geese.

2031
03:25:31.80 --> 03:25:32.80
Well, we're in it to the beach.

2032
03:25:32.80 --> 03:25:33.80
We're in it to the market.

2033
03:25:33.80 --> 03:25:34.80
We're in it, whatever.

2034
03:25:34.80 --> 03:25:38.80
Yeah, that's that's when like all those things are fired up for that.

2035
03:25:38.80 --> 03:25:42.80
Like I'm thinking about wearing a geese more often in more regular situations.

2036
03:25:42.80 --> 03:25:44.80
Just representing jiu-jitsu.

2037
03:25:44.80 --> 03:25:45.80
It's crazy.

2038
03:25:45.80 --> 03:25:50.80
The whole comprehensive psychological approach that they had,

2039
03:25:50.80 --> 03:25:52.80
because they, every once in a while, you'll hear about like,

2040
03:25:52.80 --> 03:25:55.80
Quiler would tell us about it where he'd be like, yeah, if you,

2041
03:25:55.80 --> 03:25:58.80
you know, if you lose your first tournament, you get 20 bucks.

2042
03:25:58.80 --> 03:26:00.80
If you win, you only get 10 kind of a thing and say,

2043
03:26:00.80 --> 03:26:04.80
Oh, that's something weird psychology, not weird, but that's something like intense psychology.

2044
03:26:04.80 --> 03:26:07.80
Like they're thinking, it's not like they're just throwing people in,

2045
03:26:07.80 --> 03:26:09.80
do jiu-jitsu because you have to eat a name's crazy.

2046
03:26:09.80 --> 03:26:11.80
It's like there's this whole kind of thing.

2047
03:26:11.80 --> 03:26:14.80
So everyone's on all those details, whatever, that's it's real interesting.

2048
03:26:14.80 --> 03:26:15.80
That's interesting.

2049
03:26:15.80 --> 03:26:16.80
That's interesting.

2050
03:26:16.80 --> 03:26:17.80
They were so used to it.

2051
03:26:17.80 --> 03:26:20.80
It's like, you just wear the geese.

2052
03:26:20.80 --> 03:26:24.80
I'm kind of pissed off at myself that my kids just want to wear a geese school

2053
03:26:24.80 --> 03:26:26.80
when they were seven years old.

2054
03:26:26.80 --> 03:26:27.80
What are you doing?

2055
03:26:27.80 --> 03:26:28.80
Jiu-jitsu.

2056
03:26:28.80 --> 03:26:29.80
Yeah.

2057
03:26:29.80 --> 03:26:30.80
Back away.

2058
03:26:30.80 --> 03:26:32.80
So if you want any of this jiu-jitsu stuff,

2059
03:26:32.80 --> 03:26:34.80
or if you want to get jeans, if you decide,

2060
03:26:34.80 --> 03:26:36.80
maybe you're not ready to wear a geese all the time,

2061
03:26:36.80 --> 03:26:37.80
like I'm deciding right now.

2062
03:26:37.80 --> 03:26:39.80
If you're not ready for that cool, it's cool.

2063
03:26:39.80 --> 03:26:42.80
Get yourself some jeans, get yourself some boots, get yourself some t-shirts,

2064
03:26:42.80 --> 03:26:44.80
origin, USA.com.

2065
03:26:44.80 --> 03:26:46.80
And the USA part isn't just like, oh, it's origin,

2066
03:26:46.80 --> 03:26:48.80
USA, we're calling it USA.

2067
03:26:48.80 --> 03:26:50.80
No, it's because of Made in America,

2068
03:26:50.80 --> 03:26:53.80
which by the way is not no small feet.

2069
03:26:53.80 --> 03:26:56.80
We are making everything in America.

2070
03:26:56.80 --> 03:27:00.80
Even the clay, even the clay analogy.

2071
03:27:00.80 --> 03:27:02.80
The clay is made.

2072
03:27:02.80 --> 03:27:03.80
Yeah, everything.

2073
03:27:03.80 --> 03:27:04.80
The materials are made.

2074
03:27:04.80 --> 03:27:05.80
The materials are made.

2075
03:27:05.80 --> 03:27:08.80
The copper rivets on your jeans are made in America.

2076
03:27:08.80 --> 03:27:10.80
The coppers from America.

2077
03:27:10.80 --> 03:27:12.80
The cotton is from America.

2078
03:27:12.80 --> 03:27:13.80
Some people call it cotton.

2079
03:27:13.80 --> 03:27:14.80
Yeah.

2080
03:27:14.80 --> 03:27:15.80
Of course.

2081
03:27:15.80 --> 03:27:17.80

03:27:17.80 --> 03:27:18.80
Go check it out.

2083
03:27:18.80 --> 03:27:20.80
Go support America and support GJ2.

You're self-ported.

03:27:22.80 --> 03:27:23.80

You saw it in there, right?

2094
03:27:33.80 --> 03:27:34.80

So, yeah.

2097
03:27:36.80 --> 03:27:37.80
In the toughest of situations.

2098
03:27:37.80 --> 03:27:38.80
Oh yeah.

2099
03:27:38.80 --> 03:27:39.80

03:27:40.80 --> 03:27:41.80
Yeah.

2102
03:27:41.80 --> 03:27:42.80
To the end degree.

Good stuff on there.

2107
03:27:48.80 --> 03:27:51.80
We also have a subscription scenario called

2108
03:27:51.80 --> 03:27:53.80
the shirt locker, different designs.

2109
03:27:53.80 --> 03:27:54.80
More artistic sometimes.

2110
03:27:54.80 --> 03:27:55.80
More clever sometimes.

2111
03:27:55.80 --> 03:27:57.80

If you haven't yet.

2118
03:28:07.80 --> 03:28:08.80
I don't even know if you should.

2119
03:28:08.80 --> 03:28:10.80
Maybe you should just back away from iTunes.

2120
03:28:10.80 --> 03:28:13.80
And Spotify.

2121
03:28:13.80 --> 03:28:18.80
Do you know that there's a name for people who watch videos or listen to podcasts,

2122
03:28:18.80 --> 03:28:20.80
but don't subscribe.

2123
03:28:20.80 --> 03:28:21.80
What's a name?

2124
03:28:21.80 --> 03:28:23.80
Ninja watchers.

2125
03:28:23.80 --> 03:28:25.80
They just stealthily.

2126
03:28:25.80 --> 03:28:26.80
Yeah.

2127
03:28:26.80 --> 03:28:28.80
They'll come, they'll come, whatever.

2128
03:28:28.80 --> 03:28:29.80
I don't know if it's a good thing about things.

2129
03:28:29.80 --> 03:28:32.80
I mean, it's good if you're not looking to support.

2130
03:28:32.80 --> 03:28:36.80
We also could call them free loaders.

2131
03:28:36.80 --> 03:28:37.80
Free loaders.

2132
03:28:37.80 --> 03:28:38.80
Yeah.

2133
03:28:38.80 --> 03:28:39.80
Free.

2134
03:28:39.80 --> 03:28:41.80
So I don't know that might not be as accurate.

2135
03:28:41.80 --> 03:28:42.80
It's not asking much.

2136
03:28:42.80 --> 03:28:44.80
Just to click that subscribe.

2137
03:28:44.80 --> 03:28:47.80

give me your first born child.

2139
03:28:49.80 --> 03:28:51.80
I'm going to be honest with you though.

2140
03:28:51.80 --> 03:28:52.80
Straight up.

2141
03:28:52.80 --> 03:28:55.80
I don't even know what subscribing.

2142
03:28:55.80 --> 03:28:58.80
It does for like, for the podcast.

2143
03:28:58.80 --> 03:29:00.80
I know what it does for the person subscribing.

2144
03:29:00.80 --> 03:29:01.80
You just have to try doing it.

2145
03:29:01.80 --> 03:29:02.80
It's on your feed.

2146
03:29:02.80 --> 03:29:03.80

It's all benefits.

2149
03:29:05.80 --> 03:29:06.80
For sure.

2150
03:29:06.80 --> 03:29:07.80
If you're done for.

2151
03:29:07.80 --> 03:29:09.80
Why do you care if someone subscribe?

2152
03:29:09.80 --> 03:29:11.80
I'll tell you exactly why I care.

2153
03:29:11.80 --> 03:29:12.80
Do you want to want to want to want to want to want to.

2154
03:29:12.80 --> 03:29:13.80
Why?

2155
03:29:13.80 --> 03:29:16.80
Listen, we make this podcast to help people out.

2156
03:29:16.80 --> 03:29:19.80
If someone subscribe to the podcast.

2157
03:29:19.80 --> 03:29:21.80
If you, whoever's listening right now,

2158
03:29:21.80 --> 03:29:25.80
subscribe to the podcast, that makes the podcast when it gets downloaded.

2159
03:29:25.80 --> 03:29:28.80
When you download it, when you listen to it,

2160
03:29:28.80 --> 03:29:30.80
it makes the podcast more popular.

2161
03:29:30.80 --> 03:29:35.80
The more popular the podcast is the higher it goes in the ranking of podcast.

2162
03:29:35.80 --> 03:29:37.80
The more it gets promoted inside the various podcast platforms.

2163
03:29:37.80 --> 03:29:39.80
The more it gets promoted inside the podcast platforms.

2164
03:29:39.80 --> 03:29:41.80
Someone that doesn't know about the podcast goes,

2165
03:29:41.80 --> 03:29:43.80
I wonder what that's about.

2166
03:29:43.80 --> 03:29:44.80
Seems popular.

2167
03:29:44.80 --> 03:29:46.80
A lot of people listen to it.

2168
03:29:46.80 --> 03:29:46.80
They click on it.

2169
03:29:46.80 --> 03:29:47.80
They listen to it.

2170
03:29:47.80 --> 03:29:49.80
Next thing you know, they're learning about leadership.

2171
03:29:49.80 --> 03:29:51.80
They're learning about how to overcome loss.

2172
03:29:51.80 --> 03:29:53.80
They're learning about what to do in a breakup.

2173
03:29:53.80 --> 03:29:55.80
They're learning about jujitsu.

2174
03:29:55.80 --> 03:29:58.80
So you're not just helping yourself.

2175
03:29:58.80 --> 03:30:00.80
You're not, I mean, look, like you said,

2176
03:30:00.80 --> 03:30:01.80
does it benefit from the podcast?

2177
03:30:01.80 --> 03:30:02.80
You're not helping yourself.

2178
03:30:02.80 --> 03:30:05.80
You're not, I mean, look, like you said,

2179
03:30:05.80 --> 03:30:07.80
does it benefit us directly?

2180
03:30:07.80 --> 03:30:08.80
Oh, yeah.

2181
03:30:08.80 --> 03:30:10.80
I'd echo doesn't send me a text going,

2182
03:30:10.80 --> 03:30:12.80
hey, you know,

2183
03:30:12.80 --> 03:30:14.80
our podcast is ranked number three.

2184
03:30:14.80 --> 03:30:16.80
You're not doing that.

2185
03:30:16.80 --> 03:30:22.80
But if it broadens the people that get to hear this information,

2186
03:30:22.80 --> 03:30:24.80
that's why it's important.

2187
03:30:24.80 --> 03:30:28.80
Yeah, I guess I didn't really thought of the whole chain.

2188
03:30:28.80 --> 03:30:31.80
And that's assuming that it does in fact get you higher in the ranking.

2189
03:30:31.80 --> 03:30:34.80
Oh, it definitely does.

2190
03:30:34.80 --> 03:30:35.80
Definitely does.

2191
03:30:35.80 --> 03:30:38.80
Yeah, because I mean, the rankings are based on download.

2192
03:30:38.80 --> 03:30:40.80
So if you subscribe to it, it gets downloaded.

2193
03:30:40.80 --> 03:30:42.80
If you and two of your friends, that's three.

2194
03:30:42.80 --> 03:30:43.80
That's true.

2195
03:30:43.80 --> 03:30:45.80
But can't you download it without subscribing, though?

2196
03:30:45.80 --> 03:30:46.80
And you know what else is weird?

2197
03:30:46.80 --> 03:30:48.80
I forgot to ask, kicks in this.

2198
03:30:48.80 --> 03:30:49.80
Let's face it.

2199
03:30:49.80 --> 03:30:52.80
The Gracies could have just held onto all their knowledge, right?

2200
03:30:52.80 --> 03:30:53.80
Yeah.

2201
03:30:53.80 --> 03:30:53.80
Right?

2202
03:30:53.80 --> 03:30:56.80
And just be dominating the jitsu,

2203
03:30:56.80 --> 03:30:58.80
the MMA world right now,

2204
03:30:58.80 --> 03:31:00.80
not open any schools.

2205
03:31:00.80 --> 03:31:03.80
Just keep it hidden, keep it secret.

2206
03:31:03.80 --> 03:31:04.80
Sure.

2207
03:31:04.80 --> 03:31:05.80
And other people would try and figure it out.

2208
03:31:05.80 --> 03:31:07.80
But it's different, right?

2209
03:31:07.80 --> 03:31:08.80
It's different.

2210
03:31:08.80 --> 03:31:10.80
It's, but the right thing to do,

2211
03:31:10.80 --> 03:31:15.80
and their art has progressed more because they opened it up and gave it to the world.

2212
03:31:15.80 --> 03:31:17.80
That's all we're trying to do, too.

2213
03:31:17.80 --> 03:31:21.80
So you're just asking to subscribe is to receive, essentially.

2214
03:31:21.80 --> 03:31:24.80
No, no, no, to subscribe is to help.

2215
03:31:24.80 --> 03:31:26.80
It's to help other people learn.

2216
03:31:26.80 --> 03:31:28.80
It's to help this mentality.

2217
03:31:28.80 --> 03:31:31.80
You know, you can't go to get a job at some new office.

2218
03:31:31.80 --> 03:31:33.80
There's people that are like, hey, nice to meet you.

2219
03:31:33.80 --> 03:31:34.80
There egos and check.

2220
03:31:34.80 --> 03:31:36.80
They're looking to cover and move and they're,

2221
03:31:36.80 --> 03:31:38.80
you're able to function better and the world gets,

2222
03:31:38.80 --> 03:31:39.80
becomes a better place.

2223
03:31:39.80 --> 03:31:41.80
So you guys, um, in the teams,

2224
03:31:41.80 --> 03:31:43.80
what it loads to the expression, pass the words,

2225
03:31:43.80 --> 03:31:45.80
spread the word, pass the word, pass the word,

2226
03:31:45.80 --> 03:31:46.80
spread the word, spread the word, spread the word, spread the word,

2227
03:31:46.80 --> 03:31:47.80
spread the word, spread the word, spread the word, spread the word, spread the word, spread the word.

2228
03:31:47.80 --> 03:31:47.80
Right?

2229
03:31:47.80 --> 03:31:48.80
Yep.

2230
03:31:48.80 --> 03:31:49.80
Pass the word, so we're all on the same page.

2231
03:31:49.80 --> 03:31:50.80
We're all doing it.

2232
03:31:50.80 --> 03:31:52.80
You're making the whole place a better place.

2233
03:31:52.80 --> 03:31:54.80
So, so like I was saying,

2234
03:31:54.80 --> 03:31:55.80
subscribe.

2235
03:31:55.80 --> 03:31:58.80
I'm going to ask you guys, that I do with my brother,

2236
03:31:58.80 --> 03:32:01.80
Darrell Cooper DC, who also has a podcast called

2237
03:32:01.80 --> 03:32:03.80
Marker Made.

2238
03:32:03.80 --> 03:32:05.80
Grounded podcast, which is about you,

2239
03:32:05.80 --> 03:32:06.80
just so I guess we just kind of did it.

2240
03:32:06.80 --> 03:32:08.80
Did you just do podcast in a way?

2241
03:32:08.80 --> 03:32:11.80
Uh, warrior kid podcast as well for the kids out there.

2242
03:32:11.80 --> 03:32:13.80
We also have a jockel underground.com.

2243
03:32:13.80 --> 03:32:15.80
Where we have a little alternative podcast.

2244
03:32:15.80 --> 03:32:18.80
We do some, some expanded topics.

2245
03:32:18.80 --> 03:32:19.80
We go into some detail.

2246
03:32:19.80 --> 03:32:23.80
We do a lot of Q&A that people can ask questions directly.

2247
03:32:23.80 --> 03:32:26.80
If you're a member of jockel underground.com,

2248
03:32:26.80 --> 03:32:28.80
you got to pay to be a member.

2249
03:32:28.80 --> 03:32:30.80
Well, actually, technically, you don't have to pay.

2250
03:32:30.80 --> 03:32:35.80
Look, we request you pay $18 a month to be a part of that subscription.

2251
03:32:35.80 --> 03:32:37.80
But if you can't afford it, it's cool.

2252
03:32:37.80 --> 03:32:39.80
We still want you to be in the game.

2253
03:32:39.80 --> 03:32:41.80
We still want you to have this knowledge.

2254
03:32:41.80 --> 03:32:43.80
You email assistance at jockel underground.com.

2255
03:32:43.80 --> 03:32:45.80
And the reason we have that is because

2256
03:32:45.80 --> 03:32:50.80
Look, these tech platforms are very large and very powerful.

2257
03:32:50.80 --> 03:32:54.80
And they actually have the power to insert advertisements

2258
03:32:54.80 --> 03:32:56.80
into our podcast.

2259
03:32:56.80 --> 03:33:01.80
They have the ability to edit or remove or whatever.

2260
03:33:01.80 --> 03:33:03.80
Banos.

2261
03:33:03.80 --> 03:33:05.80
I'm not going to mention the podcast name,

2262
03:33:05.80 --> 03:33:08.80
but it's one that's kind of internet work.

2263
03:33:08.80 --> 03:33:09.80
I know, here's the thing.

2264
03:33:09.80 --> 03:33:11.80
In fact, I maybe should even say this,

2265
03:33:11.80 --> 03:33:12.80
but I don't know.

2266
03:33:12.80 --> 03:33:14.80
Thing is, you was randomly removed.

2267
03:33:14.80 --> 03:33:16.80
It's just removed.

2268
03:33:16.80 --> 03:33:17.80
Yeah.

2269
03:33:17.80 --> 03:33:19.80
From only one specific platform to it, by the way.

2270
03:33:19.80 --> 03:33:22.80
And I noticed the title of it.

2271
03:33:22.80 --> 03:33:25.80
I was like, oh, that could be a controversial title.

2272
03:33:25.80 --> 03:33:26.80
Yeah.

2273
03:33:26.80 --> 03:33:30.80
So we don't want to have any of these platforms to have

2274
03:33:30.80 --> 03:33:33.80
Final say on what we're doing.

2275
03:33:33.80 --> 03:33:36.80
So we made the jockel underground.com.

2276
03:33:36.80 --> 03:33:39.80
And if you want to help us out with that alternative platform.

2277
03:33:39.80 --> 03:33:40.80
If we ever have to leave these platforms,

2278
03:33:40.80 --> 03:33:42.80
we have a place to land.

2279
03:33:42.80 --> 03:33:46.80
And we appreciate the support that we have a YouTube channel

2280
03:33:46.80 --> 03:33:51.80
where I am the assistant director to many of the superior.

2281
03:33:51.80 --> 03:33:53.80
Amazing videos.

2282
03:33:53.80 --> 03:33:54.80
That's real fun.

2283
03:33:54.80 --> 03:33:55.80
Let's be catching on.

2284
03:33:55.80 --> 03:33:57.80
But you're the assistant director.

2285
03:33:57.80 --> 03:33:59.80
What's funny about it?

2286
03:33:59.80 --> 03:34:00.80
It's just, you know.

2287
03:34:00.80 --> 03:34:04.80
What's funny about it is what's really funny about it is that we joke about it.

2288
03:34:04.80 --> 03:34:06.80
But what's really funny is you know what I'm funny.

2289
03:34:06.80 --> 03:34:07.80
Kind of true.

2290
03:34:07.80 --> 03:34:09.80
Because you know occasionally, I get shot.

2291
03:34:09.80 --> 03:34:10.80
You got shot.

2292
03:34:10.80 --> 03:34:11.80
You got shot.

2293
03:34:11.80 --> 03:34:12.80
I do the shot.

2294
03:34:12.80 --> 03:34:14.80
So go to go to YouTube and subscribe to

2295
03:34:14.80 --> 03:34:17.80
Jockel podcast also origin.

2296
03:34:17.80 --> 03:34:19.80
Origin USA has a podcast channel.

2297
03:34:19.80 --> 03:34:21.80
But if you want to know what's going on up in Maine,

2298
03:34:21.80 --> 03:34:22.80
yeah.

2299
03:34:22.80 --> 03:34:23.80
You check that one.

2300
03:34:23.80 --> 03:34:26.80
That's a good one to stay to stay like kind of in the game as far as I

2301
03:34:26.80 --> 03:34:30.80
like, hey, this is what like legitimate almost in a way

2302
03:34:30.80 --> 03:34:32.80
redefined American manufacturing.

2303
03:34:32.80 --> 03:34:33.80
Yeah.

2304
03:34:33.80 --> 03:34:34.80
That's a whatever.

2305
03:34:34.80 --> 03:34:37.80
It is a unique one because of like the culture of all them and

2306
03:34:37.80 --> 03:34:38.80
peed and like all them.

2307
03:34:38.80 --> 03:34:40.80
Yeah, it's cool to know what's going on too, right?

2308
03:34:40.80 --> 03:34:41.80
Like you order those boots.

2309
03:34:41.80 --> 03:34:42.80
You can see who made.

2310
03:34:42.80 --> 03:34:44.80
Yeah, you can see the thing about that.

2311
03:34:44.80 --> 03:34:46.80
You go to a regular store and buy a pair of jeans.

2312
03:34:46.80 --> 03:34:50.80
You have no idea what you know starving person in a

2313
03:34:50.80 --> 03:34:51.80
sweatshop in China.

2314
03:34:51.80 --> 03:34:53.80
You know, you don't know, right?

2315
03:34:53.80 --> 03:34:56.80
You know that they got paid 13 cents for their weeks worth of

2316
03:34:56.80 --> 03:34:57.80
work like slave labor.

2317
03:34:57.80 --> 03:34:58.80
Yeah.

2318
03:34:58.80 --> 03:35:01.80
Or you can actually go to origin USA and see the people that are

2319
03:35:01.80 --> 03:35:04.80
making your stuff and see what they're doing and getting the game.

2320
03:35:04.80 --> 03:35:05.80
It's freaking legit.

2321
03:35:05.80 --> 03:35:07.80
Maine ties up there doing it.

2322
03:35:07.80 --> 03:35:09.80
Yeah, doing great work up there.

2323
03:35:09.80 --> 03:35:13.80
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2324
03:35:13.80 --> 03:35:15.80
Also psychological warfare.

2325
03:35:15.80 --> 03:35:18.80
If you're having moments of weakness like I used to.

2326
03:35:18.80 --> 03:35:20.80
None anymore.

2327
03:35:20.80 --> 03:35:23.80
Maybe I do sometimes, but if you have those, you know, you

2328
03:35:23.80 --> 03:35:24.80
want to skip the workout.

2329
03:35:24.80 --> 03:35:27.80
You have a workout planned and then all of a sudden you're like,

2330
03:35:27.80 --> 03:35:30.80
hey, man, maybe today would be best to rest.

2331
03:35:30.80 --> 03:35:34.80
But you know that deep down that that's just you've been lazy or

2332
03:35:34.80 --> 03:35:35.80
not in the mood and being weaker.

2333
03:35:35.80 --> 03:35:36.80
Whatever psychological warfare.

2334
03:35:36.80 --> 03:35:38.80
He got jockel helping you through those moments.

2335
03:35:38.80 --> 03:35:39.80
I'm going to be a problem with tracks.

2336
03:35:39.80 --> 03:35:42.80
I get that wherever you purchase MP3s.

2337
03:35:42.80 --> 03:35:43.80
So they don't.

2338
03:35:43.80 --> 03:35:46.80
And if you want some cool stuff to hang on your wall to keep you on the path,

2339
03:35:46.80 --> 03:35:49.80
go to flipsidecampus.com, Dakota Meyer.

2340
03:35:49.80 --> 03:35:56.80
He has that company and they're making cool graphical things images to put on your wall,

2341
03:35:56.80 --> 03:35:57.80
which is cool books.

2342
03:35:57.80 --> 03:35:58.80
Got a bunch of books.

2343
03:35:58.80 --> 03:35:59.80
Hey, this book right here.

2344
03:35:59.80 --> 03:36:02.80
Breathe a life in flow by Hicks and Grace.

2345
03:36:02.80 --> 03:36:03.80
You just heard from them.

2346
03:36:03.80 --> 03:36:05.80
There's so much more information that I didn't cover.

2347
03:36:05.80 --> 03:36:06.80
I wrote the forward.

2348
03:36:06.80 --> 03:36:07.80
What an honor.

2349
03:36:07.80 --> 03:36:08.80
A little bit of the forward.

2350
03:36:08.80 --> 03:36:10.80
There's quite a bit more to the forward.

2351
03:36:10.80 --> 03:36:11.80
Explain some of these things about your juts.

2352
03:36:11.80 --> 03:36:13.80
What impact it had on me.

2353
03:36:13.80 --> 03:36:17.80
So get the book breathe by Hicks and Gracey and Peter McWire.

2354
03:36:17.80 --> 03:36:21.80
Another awesome guy that helped help them write that book.

2355
03:36:21.80 --> 03:36:24.80
Final spin.

2356
03:36:24.80 --> 03:36:25.80
Let's face it.

2357
03:36:25.80 --> 03:36:26.80
We don't know what's going to happen.

2358
03:36:26.80 --> 03:36:28.80
We're final spin.

2359
03:36:28.80 --> 03:36:31.80
People are unsure what final spin even is.

2360
03:36:31.80 --> 03:36:32.80
Is it a book?

2361
03:36:32.80 --> 03:36:33.80
Is it a novel?

2362
03:36:33.80 --> 03:36:34.80
Is it a poem?

2363
03:36:34.80 --> 03:36:35.80
Is it a story?

2364
03:36:35.80 --> 03:36:36.80
Is it a manuscript?

2365
03:36:36.80 --> 03:36:37.80
We don't know what it is.

2366
03:36:37.80 --> 03:36:38.80
Literature?

2367
03:36:38.80 --> 03:36:39.80
Literature?

2368
03:36:39.80 --> 03:36:40.80
Literature?

2369
03:36:40.80 --> 03:36:43.80
There's no one that's going to try and pin it down.

2370
03:36:43.80 --> 03:36:49.80
I think it will create its own form of literature.

2371
03:36:49.80 --> 03:36:51.80
You're going to want that first edition.

2372
03:36:51.80 --> 03:36:53.80

2375
03:37:01.80 --> 03:37:03.80

And if you want to donate or you want to get involved, go to America's Mighty Warriors.org.

2413
03:38:58.80 --> 03:39:03.80
find us on the other web's on Twitter, on Instagram, which echoingly calls the

03:39:03.80 --> 03:39:04.80

Hicks and Gracie.

03:39:10.80 --> 03:39:15.80
And Gracie, for giving us all the gift of jiu-jitsu.

2419
03:39:15.80 --> 03:39:17.80
And also, thanks to the Gracie family.

2420
03:39:17.80 --> 03:39:26.80
I didn't mention this, but they've spent a lot of time teaching our military, the art of jiu-jitsu.

2421
03:39:26.80 --> 03:39:30.80
Many of the Gracies have worked with the military over the years to improve our operational capability.

2422
03:39:30.80 --> 03:39:35.80
It is much appreciated and to those military folks that have taken those skills and

2423
03:39:35.80 --> 03:39:39.80
use them to protect us overseas.

2424
03:39:39.80 --> 03:39:40.80
We thank you for that.

2425
03:39:40.80 --> 03:39:45.80
And the Gracie family has also helped much of law enforcement.

2426
03:39:45.80 --> 03:39:55.80
And we hope that law enforcement further embraces jiu-jitsu as a highly beneficial thing that will help

2427
03:39:55.80 --> 03:39:57.80
them in every aspect of what they do.

2428
03:39:57.80 --> 03:39:59.80
So, thanks to the Gracie family for that.

2429
03:39:59.80 --> 03:40:04.80
And also, thanks to our police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2430
03:40:04.80 --> 03:40:10.80
correctional officers, boarded patrol secret service, and all first responders who put those skills

2431
03:40:10.80 --> 03:40:15.80
to work to protect us here on the home front.

2432
03:40:15.80 --> 03:40:18.80
And now everyone else out there.

2433
03:40:18.80 --> 03:40:20.80
Please.

2434
03:40:20.80 --> 03:40:25.78
No matter who you are, no matter what you do, no matter what you think, no matter where you're

2435
03:40:25.78 --> 03:40:33.78
from or where you are, do me and yourself a favor.

2436
03:40:33.78 --> 03:40:35.78
And go train jiu-jitsu.

2437
03:40:35.78 --> 03:40:43.78
They will make you healthier, smarter, stronger, more confident, more aware.

2438
03:40:43.78 --> 03:40:50.78
I mean, I could go on, but suffice to say, it will make you a better person so go out there

2439
03:40:50.78 --> 03:40:53.78
and get after it.

2440
03:40:53.78 --> 03:40:57.78
And until next time, this is echo and jockel.

03:40:57.78 --> 03:41:24.78
Out.
