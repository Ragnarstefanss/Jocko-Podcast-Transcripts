00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is Jocco podcast number 126 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening, and tonight also joining us is Mr. David Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.

2
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.000
On September 27, 1950, approximately 60 American prisoners who had been confined in prison were taken into the prison yard in groups of 14 with their hands wired together.

3
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:49.000
These men were forced to sit hunched and hastily dubbed ditches and then were shot by North Korean troops at point blank range with American M1 rifles using armor piercing ammunition.

4
00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Two seriously wounded survivors only one lived to recount the gruesome details. Unnumbered civilians estimated at between 5,000 and 7,000 as well as soldiers of the Republic of Korea were also slaughtered between September 23rd and September 27th, 1950.

5
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The first sergeant, Carrie H. Y. Now, formally with the 23rd Infantry Regiment 2nd Division, Korea was the sole survivor of the infamous Tejon massacre.

6
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He testified at a congressional hearing and I'm going to read some of that transcript. Here's Sergeant Y. Nell.

7
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The last, they was in a hurry to leave Tejon to evacuate Tejon, so they took approximately the last three groups pretty close together. I witnessed the group right in front of me shot.

8
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then, then, send her Potter asks, what happened to you when you were shot? Sergeant Y. Nell replies,

9
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I leaned over against the next man pretending I was done for. In firing, they hit my hand.

10
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Send her Potter. How were you? Sitting in the ditch? Sergeant Y. Nell. They was aiming at my head. I have a scar on my neck, one on my collarbone, and another in my hand. They hit me three times.

11
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And you played dead? Yes, sir. After they thought everyone was dead, they started burying us. I came pretty close to getting panicky about that time, but somehow or another, I figured as long as I had some breath.

12
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There was hope. In other words, you were buried alive. That is right, sir. I might add in that whole group that I was with.

13
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
There was not a man that begged for mercy, and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal.

14
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Sergeant, how long were you buried alive? That is hard to say, sir. As I say, I was shot around five o'clock in the morning, and I stayed in the ditch until that evening, until what time it was dark.

15
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I would say approximately eight hours, seven or eight hours.

16
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Now, that is from a report on Korean war atrocities written by the subcommittee on Korean war investigations. And I want to repeat one line again from Sergeant Y. Nell.

17
00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:05.000
He says, in that whole group that I was with, there was not a man that begged for mercy, and there was not a man that cracked under the ordeal.

18
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So think about that.

19
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Think about the will and the discipline of those men to be facing certain death that the hands of a murderous enemy, but to face death with solemn silence and show no signs of breaking.

20
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Said before that war brings out the worst in people, but it also brings out the best.

21
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And that is but one of thousands upon thousands of examples of the dedication of our military fighting men.

22
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I'm going to read you another example from the same war around the same time, but this one is an award citation.

23
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And it reads, the president of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the silver star to first lieutenant armor Thomas Wilford five United States Army for gallantry in action as a member of company B 72nd tank battalion.

24
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Second infantry division in action against an armed enemy on 19 September 1950 in the vicinity of young sang Korea.

25
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000
On that date lieutenant five was in command of a platoon of tanks charged with the support of infantry elements in the defense of young sang perimeter.

26
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And a tactic position with superior numbers and a fanatic determination to penetrate through to the division main supply route.

27
00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The enemy attack was successful in routing the friendly elements and inflicting casualties to the extent that the organization and combat effectiveness of the positions was completely disrupted.

28
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The previous mission of the situation lieutenant five disregarded the heavy enemy fire and dismounted from the protective armor of his tank to reorganize the foot elements.

29
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:28.000
After reorganization, he remained on the ground and successfully reestablished the positions by controlling both the foot elements and his tanks by means of radio communications.

30
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The same date while engaged in a friendly attack against the enemy lieutenant five again displayed gallantry by refusing evacuation after being wounded.

31
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The leadership loyalty and gallant actions demonstrated that day by lieutenant five aren't keeping with the highest traditions of the military service.

32
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So lieutenant five was under attack from devastating enemy fire, but he did not remain in the protection of his tank.

33
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000
In fact, he did the opposite. He exited his tank to organize troops and stop the enemy attack. He risked his life to lead his men.

34
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Then he would continue to lead even after wounded. Now, Korea was not the first war for lieutenant five nor would it be his last.

35
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Lieutenant five had actually already fought in World War II. He fought in Korea and he fought in Vietnam.

36
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
He also received three purple hearts for each of the three times he was wounded once in each war.

37
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And in addition to the silver star from Korea, he also received another silver star for his service in Vietnam and a Legion of Merit and a distinguished fine cross.

38
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And survived all that, and served our great nation for 25 years.

39
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And I will say that it is my absolute honor to have retired Colonel Thomas Fife on the podcast today.

40
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Sir, thank you for coming on.

41
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It's nice to be here, I think.

42
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I've listened to that story. It brought back years. Quite frankly, I'm upset just because of the memory of that.

43
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It was a horrible experience, but when it had to get done, I still remember getting how that tank.

44
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I wonder in one day, I was doing it. But something had to be done.

45
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:06.000
When you see thousands of people coming at you, you have nothing but your weapons.

46
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:16.000
You and the guys needed some help. They were willing to.

47
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I guess run, I don't know what they were. They needed leadership.

48
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And that's all I think I could think of to get out and try to be there with them.

49
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And I think God would turn them around and we were able to stop the enemy.

50
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You can't understand what it's like to be there and having thousands of people come rushing at you.

51
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And the best you can do is shoot your tank guns and you machine guns.

52
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And they just kept coming. They just kept coming.

53
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I mean, talk about discipline. Those guys were discipline too.

54
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And we had to get our guys together and we did.

55
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And it was, I think I was lucky. I was damn lucky.

56
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
By the way, my wounds weren't that serious. I got shot and he asked.

57
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And it closed up. The wound closed up.

58
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And so it stopped bleeding.

59
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And for all practical purposes, I was as good as good as new for a while.

60
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So I mean, it wasn't that serious a wound.

61
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I mean, I, I, I would hope to be evacuated to Japan, but didn't work.

62
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So you're million dollar wound turned out to be like a 50 cent wound.

63
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:56.000
At least it was, it was, you know, when you, when I got wounded, I felt the blood rush into my pants.

64
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And then it stopped. So why not keep going?

65
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So, as I was concerned, the wound was dead over.

66
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And when I finally got to the mass hospital, the doctor said,

67
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
That's what we can do for you. It's going to work its way out or stay there forever.

68
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It eventually worked its way out, which is how I ended up being evacuated

69
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
when we were up in North Korea. And got to a hospital ship,

70
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and they, they took the piece of metal out of my butt.

71
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And then my carthor just said, General McArthur said,

72
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We're going to be home by thanks by Christmas.

73
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So my objective was to get off that hospital ship as fast as I could and get back to my units.

74
00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And of course the Chinese hit. And so I was now trying to get back to my unit.

75
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And the Army was totally screwed up, but you didn't know where who was where.

76
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So I ended up finding to be on Yang,

77
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and the land in Yang, the capital in North Korea, and the airfield was totally surrounded by fire.

78
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We were destroying all of our equipment and whatever else.

79
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We landed there playing the plane landed, and I had to go find my unit.

80
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And nobody knew where it was. So I got on the road and started hitchhiking.

81
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Yeah, the guy came along, happened to be a classmate of mine who was in the middle of the corps.

82
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
He stopped saw me, picked me up, took me back to where he was, which was core headquarters.

83
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And they didn't know where and how my outfit was.

84
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So finally they took me back to the mass hospital, another mass hospital.

85
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And the mass hospital I'm nowhere my unit was.

86
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And they took me back to my unit in an ambulance.

87
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now I wasn't wounded, there was just a way to convey it, get me back to my unit.

88
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I still remember those days. Terrible experience, but fun.

89
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
It's hard for people to understand that I have that discussion with people a lot when you're saying, hey, this is the worst time of my life.

90
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
And also the best time of my life at the same time.

91
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Let's get into Korea, but let's talk a little bit about where you came from, how you grew up.

92
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Starting with, I guess, Su-Sidi Iowa.

93
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That's right. Well, I was a kid growing up in the middle of the United States.

94
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I was reminded, on the way over here, I was talking when Pearl Harbor happened.

95
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I was 16 years old, I was in a movie theater.

96
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And they stopped the movie and they announced that Japanese just bought Pearl Harbor.

97
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was.

98
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And I knew where the Hawaiian Islands were, but I didn't know Pearl Harbor was in the Hawaiian Islands.

99
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Well, you're in Iowa. There's no oceans.

100
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Nobody knows. Nobody.

101
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We don't think about oceans. And so here we were in this movie.

102
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I was almost 16 as I said. And I said, well, hell, the world before I ever get called in.

103
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Well, that turned out to be wrong.

104
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So as I said, I was going through high school.

105
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I told objective, well, I was in high school. It's going to become a chemical engineer.

106
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You can go to Cornell University. Why?

107
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Because my best friends, oldest brother-in-law, was a chemical engineer working in Sumatra.

108
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Well, you grow up in Iowa. Sumatra is sound like a pretty good thing to be doing.

109
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So, that's why I wanted to be a chemical engineer.

110
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And I was going to go to Cornell because he wanted to Cornell.

111
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And that was going to be what I was going to do.

112
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Well, the war happened.

113
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And I suddenly became a team and you get drafted.

114
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It's hard for people to realize today.

115
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Every place you go, people are in uniform.

116
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
When people are walking around in sub-inclos, the only people who weren't sub-inclos

117
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
are those who couldn't qualify because of physical disabilities.

118
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So everybody was in uniform, no matter where you were.

119
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So I got drafted.

120
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And fortunately, my dad was smart enough to send me off to Iowa State before I was 18.

121
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And I got two quarters in as an engineer.

122
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
So the Army in this great wisdom decided to make the incumbent engineer.

123
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Which I've been in being an infant to be in as far as I was concerned.

124
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So I went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.

125
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Now, when you're from Sumatra, Columbia, South Carolina is it.

126
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
He's on some way.

127
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
He took us five days on a damn train to get there.

128
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So we got there in all of us soldiers could have to train.

129
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
And the first person got us all lined up there.

130
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And he's calling and roll.

131
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
And he says, fee fee.

132
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And I yell five. From that moment on, I was fee fee.

133
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:47.000
So anyway, that was in March of 1944.

134
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And so we went through basic train.

135
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
It learned to be a incumbent engineer.

136
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I became a demolition specialist.

137
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000
It's hard for people to realize, here's the kid who grows up in Suci's Iowa.

138
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
And suddenly it's handing explosives.

139
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I had no more idea of doing that in the man in the moon.

140
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So in the training, we were primarily learning to build bridges and take care of roads.

141
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
That was our primary mission.

142
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But we also were taught to be infantrymen.

143
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Common engineers had a secondary responsibility.

144
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:48.000
And so we ended up, fortunately, going to Europe,

145
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
when we were in training, we had no idea what direction we were going to go.

146
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
But in retrospect, I've always felt that we were lucky to go to Europe,

147
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
rather than into the southeast.

148
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
However, when I got to Europe, it was colder and hell.

149
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I wasn't sure that was a really great decision.

150
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
It worked out all right.

151
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:28.000
But our primary role was to go to Europe and become a take care of the roads and all the things that engineers do.

152
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And so you showed up there, is it were you right around the battle of both time frame?

153
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yes.

154
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I mean, the battle of the roads was, I remember, right around Christmas time of 1944.

155
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And we got to the continent at that time.

156
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000
But our unit went to Luxembourg.

157
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000
It primarily was helping General Patton's army,

158
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
to make a 90 degree turn and go north to help stop the Germans.

159
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And so the roads had to be taken care of.

160
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And that's what our unit was doing.

161
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So during the actual combat at the best home, we were working on roads and keeping the roads open for the Patton's army to get up there.

162
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Our unit eventually eliminated the last Germans from Luxembourg.

163
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And a little town called Vyandon, which is on the hour river, right across from the Seek Free border, a Seek Free line.

164
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And so the 1250-15th Engineer Combat Battalion turned in an infantry outfit for brief, very time.

165
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:19.000
February 12th, 1945, we got rid of all the Germans, last Germans in the country of Luxembourg.

166
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:29.000
The combat engineers, I always want to give them their due, because they continued to keep roads open.

167
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000
When we were fighting, in Ramadi it was the combat engineers primarily that they had the duty of mine clearance.

168
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And it was a brutal and I mean obviously a highly dangerous job for them to be out there, clear in those mines and keep in those roads open.

169
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
That's a hell of a job.

170
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I guess a demolition specialist, one of my other, one of my jows was mine clearance.

171
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And I was operating a mine sweeper on this road down into the valley at Vyandon, and behind me were the two tanks from the Calvary unit.

172
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000
And Germans could see the tanks. I guess they could see us too, but they sure had held it.

173
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Looking at the tanks and shooting out the tanks. And a lot of their machine gun fire would ricochet off the tanks.

174
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And that's how I got hit with ricochet off the dam tank.

175
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Got into my leg and arm. But superficially. I mean, all I just go back to the aid station and get managed up and back to my unit.

176
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Wasn't any hospitalization at all that kind of stuff.

177
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Another 50 cent wound for you.

178
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Exactly. I mean, I had a lot of those.

179
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
So how long were you, so did you stay over in Europe until the war ended?

180
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:13.000
No, actually in March, the unit got orders from me to return to the United States because I had appointments to the United States military.

181
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Okay.

182
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:21.000
And so my very first airplane ride was from Leace, Belgium, to Paris.

183
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And I was, I remember going into this office in Paris, and I was dressed in my battle gear, so to speak.

184
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
And they looked at me and they said, and I had it still everywhere.

185
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:42.000
I was still wearing my steel helmet. And I can still remember this sergeant scene.

186
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
We got to take her this guy. We got to dress him up.

187
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And so they put me in all brand new clothes. Two days later, I was on a airplane flying back to United States.

188
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Twenty seven hours later, and five stops in route.

189
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
We ended up in Washington, D.C.

190
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:15.000
So I ended up, my first time at Everett's visit to Pentagon.

191
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Here is this 19 year old PFC dressed in brand new clothes walking into the Pentagon.

192
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
And I can tell you, I wasn't sure what they were always doing.

193
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:46.000
So I got orders to go to Cornell University. Cornell University, but for to get reacademic reacademic.

194
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So you had orders to West Point, but they were going to send you to Cornell for a little while to prepare for it?

195
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Well, no, I had an appointment to the academy.

196
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Okay. And if you had an appointment, the academy in fact, this is still to the day.

197
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000
If you're having an appointment with the academy, take you out of combat and bring you back some place safe.

198
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And what they brought us back, there was about 300 of us at Cornell all from different parts of the service.

199
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So we armed the air force, there was fact downstairs of the US Army Air Corps.

200
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And we were there for them to get reacademic.

201
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Turn your brain back on.

202
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Yeah. Thank you.

203
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
So that was.

204
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
At this point, did you know you wanted to stay in the Army as a career?

205
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Had you enjoyed your time in Europe and you said, you know what I think I'm going to do.

206
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Think of it as a distance or no.

207
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I had no idea.

208
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It wasn't until after.

209
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Well, very quickly.

210
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
My appointment to the academy was an alternate appointment.

211
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
And as the principal, if he qualifies, he often doesn't get to go in my principal qualifies.

212
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So, now what do they do with me?

213
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
The Army is great infinite.

214
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
It was the decided to send me to our security school.

215
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So they sent me down to Fort Bell, Ward of the Engineer of Security School.

216
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
The Army knew they were going to need a lot of technical tennis or in the southeast Asia.

217
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:51.000
So anyway, in the middle of the officer Kennedy School, the Ward of Japan ended.

218
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Now what?

219
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Well, they stopped the officer Kennedy's wrist.

220
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Slow it down, I guess, as the right word.

221
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And what I continued on in graduated in the January of 1945.

222
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
And here I was now a settle tennis.

223
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
So you got your commission?

224
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Yeah. And I had a principal appointment to the military academy.

225
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
So what are they doing?

226
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
So they kept me at Fort Bell Ward training recruits.

227
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And then in July, they discharged me from the Army.

228
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
The military academy is a good hit.

229
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And July 1st, 1946.

230
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:43.000
It was somewhere in there that I started to like the Army.

231
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
I got it.

232
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
But I knew if I wanted to be an engineer, I'd damn well had to get a college education.

233
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Well, we're better to go than to.

234
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
The place that's most attractive to be an Army engineer, which is this case West Point.

235
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So I went on to West Point and spent four years there, obviously.

236
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And graduated in 1950.

237
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So you got commissioned?

238
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
They took your commission away for four years.

239
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
And then they gave it back to you at the end of 40 years.

240
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Yes.

241
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
The only rank I've ever had was an Army with twice, but second lieutenant.

242
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Yes, that's right.

243
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
And West Point at this point is being run by just all World War II veterans.

244
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I'm sure.

245
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Yes.

246
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:44.000
In fact, our tactical officers were all lieutenant colonels who had been

247
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:56.000
a commander of some sort in World War II in Europe or in their force, in fact, tactical officer of my company.

248
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
The first two years was an artilleryman.

249
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
And the second two years was an Air Force.

250
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Well, it was US Army Air Corps became the Air Force Lieutenant Colonel.

251
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
So, and then the superintendent was Maxwell Taylor.

252
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
And the commander was guy named Paul D. Hartman, who was Colonel Hartman.

253
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
He was General Patton's hatchet man.

254
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:36.000
And the deputy commander was a guy named John K. Waters, who was General Patton's son-in-law.

255
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So, they were all World War II veterans.

256
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
And as we're at the time of that, had to be.

257
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Was that fairly unique?

258
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Was there a lot of other guys that were prior and listed that were coming to West Point?

259
00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I'm of my class who started about 1100 of us.

260
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
I would guess several hundred were veterans of some sort.

261
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Navy, Army, Army Air Corps, yes.

262
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I would say about 200 to 300.

263
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
I don't remember exactly.

264
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Now, when you're going through West Point, the war ends.

265
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Are you, is war on the horizon for you?

266
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Or did you guys have an attitude kind of like, well, you know, we're going to go and be peace-time Army officers for the next, however many years?

267
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Or did you see trouble brewing?

268
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
No, no trouble brewing.

269
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I mean, I don't think anybody really for self-what was going to happen to Korea.

270
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:06.000
In fact, the only thing that was trouble, if you would was Berlin Air Lift was happened while we were at Cadets.

271
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And so we saw that kind of thing, but I guess maybe in our naivety, we figured that nobody was going to be there.

272
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Nobody was going to pull the plug and really have the Russians attack or vice-presimal.

273
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
We're going to do anything.

274
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
So when you graduate, what's your next move?

275
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
What was your next move after you graduated?

276
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Well, it wasn't my move.

277
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000
North Korea invaded South Korea and here General President, President Truman decided to send US troops to

278
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Korea.

279
00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Now, one of the things when you graduate by order of rank, you're allowed to choose your branch and then where you want to go.

280
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Well, my experience was being in front of that tank and getting a scrap rail.

281
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I decided I didn't want to be out in front of the tank.

282
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
I wanted to be in the tank.

283
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So I chose not to be an engineer again.

284
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
I chose to go in an armor.

285
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:38.000
So I chose to go to once again, run up an Iowa, stay in a washing with somewhere who knows where.

286
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
So I chose Fort Lewis, Washington.

287
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
That's a place I'd want to go visit.

288
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:59.000
So that's my first post was to go to Fort Lewis, Washington, to turn out to be the 29th, no, the 72nd tank of time, which was part of the second information.

289
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:09.000
President Truman, while I was on my honeymoon in Canada, decided to send the second division off to the country.

290
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
So it was not just a career.

291
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So in my infinite wisdom, not knowing this had happened.

292
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Well, I was in Canada and I called home to wish my mother and dad happy for the July.

293
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Oh, the Army had sent a telegram to my parents house saying, for me,

294
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:42.000
to get my ass to Fort Lewis as soon as possible.

295
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Well, I'm halfway there, up and up in the El Verde Canada.

296
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So we drive off to Fort Lewis and saw a private Fort Lewis village lie.

297
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Now, you've got to, I'm now a tank of a two-liter, never been in a tank before.

298
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Let me tell you, that's an experience, most people don't want to have.

299
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:23.000
I said, only thing I had gone, by the way, many years later, what Patuon said,

300
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:35.000
that time he was my gunner. He said, we've really fortunate we had a guy who had been in combat in World War II.

301
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Not knowing that I didn't know a damn thing about a tank.

302
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000
But the good news is the Sergeant was smart enough to teach me how to be somewhat of a tanker.

303
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
On the ship, on the way over to Korea.

304
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
So you had no, you showed up, you get done with your, or you cut short your honeymoon.

305
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
You go straight to Fort Lewis and then you immediately load up.

306
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Yes. My first tanker was from the port, not from the motorpool at Fort Lewis,

307
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
to the port of Olympia, to put the tank on the ship and goodbye.

308
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
That was my first tanker.

309
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Yes, the point you made about, you know, not just that your, your Sergeant was smart enough to teach you,

310
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
but equally important is that you were smart enough to listen and we're getting,

311
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
all kinds of young officers and I'm sure you saw them through the years that they're not smart enough to listen to the people that have the experience

312
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
and that's a huge lesson learned that seems to always need to get learned by people.

313
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
I wish I told more people when I asked,

314
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
what do you do to be successful? I say listen to your Sergeant's.

315
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Listen to your Sergeant's.

316
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Ask them. Don't be afraid to ask because they'll tell you, their job is to make you successful.

317
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Yeah.

318
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
And unfortunately there are too many people who don't have egos that can allow them to do that.

319
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
No doubt about it.

320
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Yeah.

321
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
They think it's going to make them look bad when it actually, they actually elevate some of the eyes of the Sergeant.

322
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yeah.

323
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
And yeah.

324
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:24.000
So your trip overseas, you're on the ship and you show up in Korea.

325
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Yes.

326
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000
You can't understand what it's like to be several miles offshore and begin to smell.

327
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
What's going to be turned out to be the port of Busan.

328
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
You could smell it before you ever got there.

329
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:53.000
And we knew we were pulling into, and I've never, I've never been to that far the world in my whole life.

330
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:00.000
And we offloaded ourselves from the trip ship.

331
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:11.000
What if our tanks to come on the other ships and we spent four days in Busan waiting for the equipment to come.

332
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And then offloading it and getting ready to go into battle.

333
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Then at what point, this is like the battle of Busan.

334
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
This is the Busan perimeter.

335
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Yeah.

336
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
And this is the beginning of it right now.

337
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:37.000
For those of you that don't know, this is North Korean troops coming down a hundred thousand North Korean troops coming down and have you guys basically squeezed onto, it's almost a peninsula.

338
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
It's like a little knot of land that sticks out.

339
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
It's 35 miles radius from the city of Busan, was the Busan perimeter.

340
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
That was the last territory held.

341
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Everything else was held by the North Koreans.

342
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
And so when you landed there, that's the situation they were in.

343
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Yes.

344
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And how did you guys, and how did you, and your troops, feel about that?

345
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I don't think we were even cognizant of how serious it was.

346
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
After we loaded the tanks onto the rail cars,

347
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
you go to the, the rail head of Maryying, which is,

348
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
I don't know the 20 miles, 25 miles from Busan,

349
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
where we are offloaded the tanks.

350
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
It's where I first went into combat in Korea.

351
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000
I don't really know that we thought how serious it was.

352
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:55.000
It got, got the impression several days later when the division system division commander

353
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
called all the officers and singer NCOs together in a place.

354
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
And he said, men we live are die here.

355
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
And I've thought to myself, what in the hell did I get myself into here?

356
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
But that's, that's what it was.

357
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:28.000
I mean, we, you know, in hindsight, I've read books about what happened in Korea.

358
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
And we really didn't understand it.

359
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
I mean, we were just, they're doing a job.

360
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
And I don't think we really understood how perilous a situation was.

361
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:46.000
And at any point, while you were there, did you understand the peril of the situation

362
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
or were you just in your particular battles day by day trying to hold the line

363
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
where you were and didn't, was the communications kind of not effective enough

364
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
to really, for you to understand the bigger picture?

365
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
We had no idea what the bigger picture was.

366
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I mean, honest to God, we were just doing our job.

367
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:17.000
And as I said earlier, watching these waves of people come across the Nattoon river

368
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
will never, ever go away from my memory.

369
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
I mean, people were just coming, coming, coming, coming.

370
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And all we were doing was shooting, shooting, shooting.

371
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
And they were just, keep coming.

372
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And we managed to hold the line.

373
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And they didn't penetrate.

374
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:50.000
So, no, the answer is, we didn't understand perilous a situation.

375
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
As you were, you hold the line specifically, you guys, you were holding the line on that river.

376
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Yes.

377
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Were they swimming?

378
00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Were they taking boats?

379
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Were they doing?

380
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
They were waiting.

381
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
It wasn't that deep.

382
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
It wasn't that deep.

383
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
It was pretty wide river, but it wasn't that deep.

384
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
So, they were able to weigh the cross.

385
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Yeah.

386
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And they would just keep coming.

387
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And then how long did that particular?

388
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
How long were you under intense waves of attacks like that?

389
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
It was like a 20 days or something of the whole thing I think lasted.

390
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
I don't know, 20 days or something.

391
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Yeah, exactly.

392
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I don't know.

393
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
It seemed like forever.

394
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:54.000
But I think it was probably over in two or three, a couple of weeks.

395
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:04.000
The first involvement, we got off the tank's off the flat car.

396
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And then we rolled into action and my lead tank, and Fred and my very eyes exploded.

397
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.000
And it will never forget watching the tank commander go sailing out into the ditch into the right,

398
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
in the tank exploding.

399
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
We arounded a curve and unbeknownst to us.

400
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:46.000
There were two Russian tanks, man by the Koreans, up just raw, and they fired at this tank.

401
00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:00.000
And we had my potential was in force, Sherman tanks, and gas engines.

402
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And they fired, and since they fired into the gas tank, the whole thing exploded.

403
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:19.000
So my first day in Korea combat, one tank destroyed, five people at that time were tank head crew of five,

404
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
were all far more killed than the tank commander was back in the United States and less than two weeks after we left,

405
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
over three weeks after we left.

406
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And that was my first day in combat in Korea.

407
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000
So from then on, we got into the perimeter and spent a couple of weeks there.

408
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I don't remember.

409
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
You read earlier at my dissertation on September 19th, which was when I was,

410
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:09.000
I don't remember what exact date dates it was, because it wasn't too long after that happened,

411
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
that we had in Shonland in everything broke out and we were head and north.

412
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So there was a couple weeks, I don't know.

413
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:29.000
When you were from a leadership perspective dealing with losing guys in comparison to when you were in World War II,

414
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
and you weren't necessarily in command of guys, but you're seeing people get wounded, you're seeing people get killed.

415
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
What was your mindset?

416
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000
What was your perspective as a leader when the guys were getting wounded, guys were getting killed?

417
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
And then you had a bunch of, you know, you were saying that your sergeant, they felt they were lucky to have someone that had been in combat,

418
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
that had been in combat before, and then all of a sudden I know that they were looking to you saying,

419
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
okay, well, what do we do now, boss?

420
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Well, one thing about, in a tank, the crews are inside the tank, and as, with the radio,

421
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
you could direct people to do this and do that.

422
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
And so I just told them what they should be doing, and they did it.

423
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I mean, I didn't, leadership is just telling people what they should do, and they're trying to do it, and they do it.

424
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:49.000
I mean, I learned, actually I learned, I talked to, grown up on high leadership, I didn't even know what that was.

425
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000
I learned what leadership was all about at West Point.

426
00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:05.000
And that's the major difference. When I was in World War II, I was just taking care of myself.

427
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
I wasn't really too concerned about the other guy, what was going on.

428
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
We were all just doing our job.

429
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
That's very different when you're in a combat situation.

430
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
And you got people to pin on each other.

431
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
And we were all dependent upon each other when we were at a tank, but two.

432
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
And each of us were trained to do a job, and they did it.

433
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I mean, one of the things my but two didn't exist prior to, on paper, it existed.

434
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It didn't exist physically.

435
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:59.000
So what happened when we were activated, the guard house was empty out.

436
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
And we got replaced from Fort Hood, Texas, and that was my but two.

437
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:14.000
One of the best soldiers in my but two was my loiter, who had spent most of his army career in the guard house.

438
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
But you can't believe what a great soldier was in combat.

439
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I mean, because he knew what he was doing, and he was trained to do it, and he did it.

440
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I will never forget those young men.

441
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I'm still in email contact with my former gunner, who's now retired as a command sergeant major.

442
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
But he still calls me little tenets.

443
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Because he was, he kept my ass on a trouble.

444
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I'll tell you that right.

445
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000
I mean, he taught me more about how to be a, but two leaders in anybody will ever understand.

446
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:09.000
And I guess the leadership trainer I had at West Point, combined with what he's young men were teaching me.

447
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:19.000
It allowed me to become pretty effective a leader throughout not just my military career, but my commercial career too.

448
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:30.000
I, I, I strong believer in that leadership works, not just in the military, but in commercial business.

449
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Yeah.

450
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
You talked about leadership inside of tank.

451
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:47.000
What did you see and, and how did you see what was going on that got you to get out of that tank and tell you that you needed to get out of that vehicle and start directing was going on in the ground.

452
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I wish I knew the answers to that.

453
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
I mean, it just did it.

454
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
I mean, I knew something had to be done.

455
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000
And my radio communications with these guys on the ground wasn't working.

456
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:19.000
So you've got to, you've got to communicate in the only way you can communicate if the radio isn't working, you've got to get your butt off the, off the tank and down there so you can talk to these guys.

457
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Because they weren't trying to talk to me.

458
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
I was trying to talk to them and get them, figure out what the hell they should be doing.

459
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
So I just did it.

460
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
I don't know what prompted me to do it.

461
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000
It's a good question because I have no idea.

462
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
You know, I, I, I talk about that sometimes.

463
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:52.000
I talk about, as a leader being able to identify what I would call, it's, I just called the void of leadership and it's very easy to see when you are used to seeing leadership,

464
00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:02.000
you know, you know, having a deep feeling of feeling the void when you see a void of leadership, if you're aware to look for it, it's really easy to see when it's there and you go wait a second someone needs to step in here and take charge.

465
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And so you had that instinct of hey, there's a void of leadership here.

466
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
I got to do something and here we go.

467
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
It's right.

468
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
As much as you said to yourself at one point, I'm going to be inside that tank.

469
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
And then the damn time you needed to tank, you got out of it.

470
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Well, well, in hindsight, you had to do what you had to do.

471
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Absolutely.

472
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And then when what, once you guys held the line and you know, it's funny because I used that expression a lot, just talking about, you know, holding your line with your personal discipline and holding the line with your, your subordinates and we use it metaphorically and it's incredible to see here and talk to you about actually literally holding the line.

473
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:59.000
When you guys got done holding the line and you had defeated that, that onslaught from from the North Koreans, what was the next phase?

474
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Move out and move north and we.

475
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:13.000
The first week, we moved four or five miles at the most.

476
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:22.000
The next couple weeks, we moved hundreds of miles and I remember.

477
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Going as fast as we could, north and to marry up with the guys who invaded it in just.

478
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000
And we just kept going.

479
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I, and I don't remember how many opportunities we had to really get into combat.

480
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:55.000
After we, we had to push on perimeter until after we got north of, uh, civil.

481
00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I mean, we, uh, invading, I mean, the invasion force of, uh, invaded pretty well clear to that stuff away.

482
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:18.000
And so the city of Seoul was open when we, we went right through it and, uh, we kept going north.

483
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:30.000
The enemy was retreating pretty fast and we were just going as fast as we could drive enough to roads and, uh, in fact, uh,

484
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:40.000
our unit got almost the yellow river, uh, which is about the time to decide to take the,

485
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
take the stuff out of my butt.

486
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
So I, I was sent back to the hospital ship and in the harbor.

487
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
So that's when you got strappin' was when you were up by the, by the yellow river?

488
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.000
No, no, that's-

489
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Oh, that had already, that's right. That had happened earlier and the house was coming back.

490
00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
The, the stuff was working.

491
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:08.000
No, one of the things you, you got to remember is this piece of metal is in my butt.

492
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Now, in a tank, the tank commander sits his little thing to sit his butt on while he's riding around in the turret.

493
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Well, you don't do that when you have a piece of metal working his way out. It is painful to say the least.

494
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:34.000
And so I couldn't hardly wait for that to happen, but they wouldn't let me go back to the hospital until they got raised and we closed to the surface.

495
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:38.000
So when they got close to the surface, they evacuated me.

496
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And it was in November of 1950 that they sent me back to the hospital ship.

497
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
And then you, then I think you covered this, but then you got done. The metal comes out.

498
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000
And then you go back again because you're trying to, you're thinking you're going to get home by Christmas if you can get back to your unit.

499
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
And I got back to the unit eventually, but I didn't get home by Christmas.

500
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:15.000
In fact, the, by the time I got back to the unit, we were, the second division that already moved back south almost to the Han River.

501
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:33.000
And so I found the unit again somewhere south of somewhat north of the Han River, but still, we were still in North Korea, but it was the south part of North Korea.

502
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And were you in a, in a situation, did you guys get dug in?

503
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
Because I know part of the Korean War was like they dug in and it was almost like trench warfare.

504
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Did you enter that phase? Or were you still, guys still moving north and south?

505
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
We, as tanks we never dug in.

506
00:54:51.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Now, later on, I think the line stabilized pretty much around the 38th barrel.

507
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:07.000
And there was a lot of digging in defensive positions as well.

508
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
But that was more infantry not, not to tanks.

509
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
So how did you, how did you end up, what was the last phase of you being over there?

510
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Like, and what ended up bringing you back to the States?

511
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Well, the, the line sort of stabilized around the 38th barrel.

512
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And we would go forward and then we'd come back.

513
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
We would go forward, come back.

514
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Oftentimes, the, we would do patrolling, I guess, is the right word, patrolling in the forest.

515
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:09.000
A tank company was a niffin to come to your attach, ready, and on the tanks would blast forward to some enemy position.

516
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
You didn't do a firefight, take the ground, and then we'd move back again.

517
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:24.000
We were just going back and forth around that so-called,

518
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:34.000
now turned out to be the 38th barrel, but it was generally that sector.

519
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Oftentimes, the infantry would get into a lot more heavy firefight, and the tanks would.

520
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I spent a lot of time supporting infantry attacks with my tank guns, and machine guns covering their vast fine.

521
00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Advancements forward, but, uh, Doug and no, we never, the tanks were never Doug and.

522
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
And then how long did that last for?

523
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
How long did was your unit deployed over there?

524
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Was it the whole unit that, that ended up going home?

525
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
No, no.

526
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:20.000
At a certain point that you cited, at people who had been there a year would come home.

527
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:29.000
And we started rotation, and I was one of the first ones to rotate out of my unit,

528
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000
because I had some decorations, and because I'd been there a year, and it's set,

529
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:49.000
I had a lot of points, and so I was sent back, but I guess I've got back to the United States.

530
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Labor Day of 1951.

531
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:59.000
So I was evacuated, the word evacuated is probably not the right word.

532
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
I was just sent back home.

533
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
And then, so you get back home.

534
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
You know, you are coming home from Korea.

535
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Obviously, you at least experienced some pretty intense stuff, and you know, you hear a lot of times,

536
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:25.000
especially nowadays with guys coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, with guys struggling to re-adapt to life back in America.

537
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
And I think it's a little bit different, because when you came home, you were still in the army.

538
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
And I think that's the best thing for veterans, you know, if you're still in, I think the veterans that have the hardest time are veterans that get out,

539
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
and all of the sudden, the brotherhood that they are used to is gone, and the mission that they're used to is gone.

540
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:48.000
But is that what you experienced and you came home, and you still had your mission of moving forward in the army?

541
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Yes, I mean, I had no feeling of not being appreciated.

542
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:09.000
I mean, obviously, I came back, I came back, I had a daughter born while I was in Korea.

543
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:22.000
I was scared to hell out of me. I mean, I still remember this four months old child, I hold for the first time.

544
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
First of all, I ever hold anybody that size.

545
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Scared to hell out of me.

546
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
I was more scared about that than a lot of the things that happened to me.

547
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000
But anyway, I came back, went to Fort Knox.

548
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Now they simply just school learned to be a battalion leader.

549
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:51.000
And so, and then they asked me if I wanted to stay there for a Knox and run an off-sourcanny company.

550
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:59.000
And I did. And so, I spent several years running off-sourcanny company.

551
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And then they decided they didn't need any more off-sourcanny at Fort Knox, so they closed that down.

552
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And I got to select it to be an aide to John Waters.

553
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
John Waters is a gentle patents, a son and a law.

554
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And a wonderful experience learned a lot from a real gentleman.

555
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
He was a burger general at that time, the two stars.

556
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But he eventually retired as a four-star general.

557
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000
But he taught me a lot about being an officer.

558
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Not so much about leadership, but being an officer in New Germany.

559
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
He was an outstanding person.

560
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And I learned from him.

561
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:17.000
When you're working as an aide, you get pretty close to somebody.

562
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And I always feel very fortunate that I was able to be his aide.

563
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And I don't know if you know, he's the one in the movie about general patents.

564
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
And then troops in to rescue somebody in a prisoner work camp.

565
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
He was the one who was in the prisoner work camp.

566
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
And he was wounded very seriously there.

567
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And it was quite an experience working for him for several years.

568
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
That was multiple years.

569
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Part of multiple years as an aide.

570
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I spent two and a half years as an aide.

571
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:07.000
So, and then he went on to his assignments.

572
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I went on to my assignments.

573
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:24.000
And one of the experiences I had in 1956, I was a company commander of a Shaint company in Bob Molder, Germany.

574
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And he at that time was running the military assistance command and Yugoslavia.

575
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And he decided to come up and visit me.

576
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Now he's the major general.

577
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And he's coming to visit this captain in Bob Molder, Germany.

578
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And it was, you can't believe all the other stuff that went on.

579
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
What the hell is he general coming to see you for?

580
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
It's et cetera, et cetera.

581
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
But anyway, we got through all that.

582
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But he was, he didn't come to visit me in Vietnam.

583
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
When he was Pacific commander.

584
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But he was, he took care of watching what I was doing.

585
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
So it was an experience.

586
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
One of the experience and a great learning experience to be his aide.

587
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, I was actually an aide too for the Admiral.

588
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
That wasn't charge of all the seals.

589
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
And it was a very similar situation for me.

590
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It was a great guy.

591
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And I learned a ton about about the way the whole big machine worked.

592
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
You have no idea when you're a young lieutenant.

593
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
You have no idea what's going on behind the scenes.

594
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And I definitely got to learn a lot about that.

595
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
And the same thing you just talked about, you know,

596
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I had a great relationship with him.

597
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And he took care of me and my guys on many occasions,

598
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
which was great.

599
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And since he was the Admiral,

600
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
one time we were to use a surfer.

601
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And I was organizing a trip for us to go to Hawaii.

602
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And we were going to see some of the seals that were stationed out in Hawaii.

603
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And the big thing I had to do is get organized so that when we got picked up at the airport,

604
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
there were surfboards in the vehicles ready to take us directly to surfing.

605
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
As soon as we showed up,

606
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
the same people say,

607
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
what do you want these surfs?

608
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
You just get the surfboards ready.

609
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
That's what you did for the boss.

610
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
And then so you did that.

611
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
You end up, you end up,

612
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
so 56 year-over-your-competitive commander.

613
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
And what happens in between then and then?

614
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
What?

615
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And then?

616
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:47.000
I was in a unit, second-harm division.

617
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And at that time, in 57,

618
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
they had something they were going to rotate the force division,

619
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
which was the armoured division, which I had been in for the hood.

620
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The road take it to Germany,

621
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and the second armoured division,

622
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
got to rotate back to Port Hood.

623
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
However, I had only been in country for a little over a year.

624
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
And I wasn't eligible to rotate back.

625
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:26.000
So they were in their decision for those of us who weren't eligible,

626
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
had to be reassigned.

627
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
And I was reassigned to be at the Second Terry General Staff.

628
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It had Albert, which is US Army Europe.

629
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So now I'm going from being a company commander and bomb-holder Germany,

630
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
which is the end of the line.

631
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
All the way to the very senior Army command in Europe.

632
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And I'm working now for a four-star general in his general staff organization.

633
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And I had once again a chance to go from learning,

634
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
knowing what's going on down here,

635
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
to watching what's going on,

636
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
very senior leadership.

637
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And it was another opportunity for a year and a half,

638
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
I had that job, and it was just a great experience learning.

639
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
If you would be the other extreme of where you'd been,

640
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000
that was my, and then rotated back to the United States in 59

641
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
to become a math professor at West Point.

642
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But I spent four years in the math professor.

643
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And then went to the Army command general staff college

644
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
out at Fort Leavenworth.

645
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And then the Army decided that they needed to have people,

646
01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
counteracting, McNamara's whiskers.

647
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:08.000
And so they figured that somebody would have been teaching math,

648
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
probably could have done.

649
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So they sent me the University of Michigan to get a degree

650
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
in, which turned out to be operations research.

651
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
But the Army sent me to get a degree in,

652
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I didn't make a data processing,

653
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
which they didn't have such a thing at Michigan.

654
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But the closest thing to it was industrial engineering operations research.

655
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So I spent two years there getting a degree.

656
01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And then I rather than go back to the Pentagon for utilization

657
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
to where I volunteered to go to Vietnam.

658
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So I, and when you say that they were,

659
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
that the Army knew that they needed someone to counteract the whiskers.

660
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And I've talked about the whiskers,

661
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
and I've covered them somewhat because

662
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
a lot of the people operational on the ground said,

663
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
hey, these statistics that you're coming up with

664
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.000
don't take into account the human aspect of these

665
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
kind of discomfort in Vietnam.

666
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So was that something that was felt and understood inside the Army at that time?

667
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I mean, clearly it was.

668
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yes, and that's, the whole idea was to take somebody

669
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
who knew something about the Army and give him some education

670
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
to these kids, so-called kids had,

671
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and to take a little analysis on all that stuff.

672
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And so to be the other part of the board,

673
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.000
and that was to be my utilization tour.

674
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So there's a great example that,

675
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
and it's the Battle of the I-Drain Valley,

676
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and Colonel Moore talks about it.

677
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
The fact that what the whiskets basically said,

678
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
one of the things that they said was,

679
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
okay, we can kill 170 Vietnamese soldiers

680
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.000
for every one of ours that they kill.

681
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So statistically, we'll just keep running that problem over and over again,

682
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and we'll end up winning.

683
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
And I always point out,

684
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
and which everyone points out,

685
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and I'm sure you would point it out as well as

686
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000
what they didn't take into account is the fact that number one,

687
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
170 Vietnamese killed to the Vietnamese,

688
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
was not as big of a deal as we thought it would be,

689
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
and we also didn't take into account that one American dead

690
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
is a lot bigger than the statisticians thought it would be to us.

691
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And that's just a huge tragedy to go into that situation like that.

692
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Well, in fact, I,

693
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.000
many times thought body count was a dumbest thing we've ever come up with

694
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
as a measure of success in combat.

695
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And I've said that,

696
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I don't know how many times,

697
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and I still convinced that was a dumbest thing we've done over the time,

698
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
and I was there participating in it,

699
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
and it was terrible.

700
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
So let's go to Vietnam.

701
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
So you volunteered for Vietnam in 1966?

702
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Yes.

703
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Or 65?

704
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
66.

705
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Okay.

706
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
And did they automatically say,

707
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
okay, well, your Lieutenant Colonel, that means you're going to take over a squadron of Italian?

708
01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I wish that was okay.

709
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:48.000
The fact that the fact that you give the army more credit for it than just do.

710
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Now, based, along with everybody else,

711
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I was a Lieutenant Colonel, I arrived in country,

712
01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:05.000
and I was assigned initially to be the executive officer of the combat operations center of McVee,

713
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
which was the headquarters of all.

714
01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And the combat operations center was Westmoreland's Operation Center,

715
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:20.000
and it was run by a Marine Brigadier General, Bill Jones by a name,

716
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
and it was a great man.

717
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I mean, and I was his exact.

718
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000
And we, quote, ran the war, sort of speak,

719
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:39.000
the word we as a very loose term from the COC.

720
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And that was, had quarters right there in Sagan.

721
01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:53.000
And it was a cushy job.

722
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I mean, I mean, I went to work on a regular hourly basis.

723
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
I used to go in at night once in a while,

724
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:09.000
because President Johnson was going to talk to some of the action officers trying to find out what was happened to these patrols that we were sending out.

725
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That's a serious sign of micro management, huh?

726
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Let me tell you, that was a micro management of the first order, and I saw it.

727
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Absolutely saw it, and happening more often than I cared to remember.

728
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:30.000
But I had one of the evenings.

729
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I met one of my former colleagues, Armour, who was commanding the first,

730
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
the fourth gallery of the first different division.

731
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.000
He told me he was going to rotate home in December.

732
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
I said, can I get that job?

733
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.000
He said, he, he, he, he, take me up and introduce me to General Depue,

734
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
who was the vision commander.

735
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
And I went up on, I passed the test.

736
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:06.000
He'd have to know General Depue, and he was a no-non-sense guy.

737
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
He, he would, people thought I was crazy, because General Depue was a relieving,

738
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
but dying commanders for incompetence, right and left.

739
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And I figured, you know, if you go up and do your job, you're going to be okay.

740
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Don't went up.

741
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And General Depue introduced me, and General Hollins worked there.

742
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
It was the system to be a commander.

743
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And Hollins worked in both the no-cavorymen.

744
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I mean, and he couldn't, the two of them passed on me.

745
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
He said it was okay.

746
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And so I got reassigned to command of the first and fourth gallery in December of 1966,

747
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
which was a plumb job.

748
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000
That was, it was not only a plumb outfit, but General Depue used the cavalry squadron,

749
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
like it should be used.

750
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Many times later, my successors were all not as lucky as I was.

751
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I mean, I was able to fight my unit, has the unit.

752
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I had three ground troops, one cow, a meadow.

753
01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
D-trupe was a helicopter troop.

754
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I had 31 helicopters in it.

755
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:54.000
And I had division commander would assign a B-comme of the tank battalion that was assigned to my unit.

756
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And since there wasn't any real enemy aircraft, he assigned several of the batteries of the enemy aircraft

757
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
unit to my unit.

758
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So I had a unit to unparalleled in history because General Depue believed the cavalry was supposed to go find the enemy.

759
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And keep them there until his infantry could show up.

760
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And we did it more often or not.

761
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And one of the stories I tell people, I'm self-styled king of the Mr. rubber plantation,

762
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
which is 70 square miles of trees.

763
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And historically, there's little communities of workers throughout the space.

764
01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:01.000
And it became these little towns became havens for the North Vietnamese.

765
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:10.000
And so we took it upon ourselves to evacuate everybody out of the little villages to the perimeter of the...

766
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Plantation.

767
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And then took it upon ourselves to destroy the villages because the North Vietnamese were coming in at night,

768
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
using these places and shallon art units.

769
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
So we were destroying all these little handlers.

770
01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:41.000
In fact, I had an engineer come here assigned to me.

771
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
And one of the contests was between the captain, who was the engineer come to Commander in myself.

772
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'd be of my chopper.

773
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And he'd be down on the ground.

774
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And he was going to implode these villages.

775
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Now if he imploded them all, he won.

776
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And any of the villages built into what still be standing, I won.

777
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Now what did we win of beer?

778
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:11.000
And more often than not, I won. He didn't lose many.

779
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:27.000
But we got...so in the spring of 1967, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker arrives in Vietnam.

780
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The first unit he wants to visit is mine.

781
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Everybody is...what in the world is, why did he pick this and why does he come to see you?

782
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
When he gets out there and all of them, he's got a forestyle general, a couple of them.

783
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Three-star general and then Division Commander all with them.

784
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000
And then we're out in the middle of nowhere. I'm briefing them ambassador.

785
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
I get emotional, I say this.

786
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:10.000
He says, Colonel, I got more correspondence of my desk from the French about what in the hell you're doing up here.

787
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Just trying their village and all the people and calling in all this commotion.

788
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
What are you doing and why are you doing it?

789
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And I explained to him that why we were doing it because they were being havens for the north.

790
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And they were coming in and yelling at killing our troops.

791
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
And now I always remember him saying, Colonel, you just keep doing what you're doing.

792
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I'll take care of the French.

793
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
And I said, God bless you.

794
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I mean, I still get emotional with that man.

795
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
That gentleman understood what the hell was going on.

796
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
And here we talk about state-department.

797
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
People are not knowing what's going on. He knew what was going on.

798
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000
And he told me to keep doing what I was doing.

799
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And I did it.

800
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
But I will always remember him.

801
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I think at the time, I'm not sure this.

802
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000
He was either the oldest or the oldest ambassador we ever had in the state department.

803
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
But he was out there trapping around and the bunnies with me.

804
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And it was a rare experience.

805
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:29.000
But anyway, it was one of those days when you really think you counted.

806
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Yeah.

807
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And he was, to me, that's leadership too.

808
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
He was, he knew what the hell was going on.

809
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
He was able to tell me to keep doing what I was supposed to be doing.

810
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Yeah. He was a great man.

811
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:56.000
So those operations that was at the primary type of operation that you'd be doing is going into areas.

812
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And basically disrupting what the enemy was up to.

813
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Basically, the mission was searching destroy.

814
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And what we did was go find, try to find the enemy.

815
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And then destroy him.

816
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So in that, in the mission plantation,

817
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.000
we thought the enemy was not there.

818
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But we spent, there was something called the iron triangle.

819
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:38.000
North of Saigon is about 30 miles north of Saigon,

820
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
which was our operational area.

821
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:51.000
And it was traditionally a haven for the north.

822
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And or the whoever.

823
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Anyway, the guys that were shooting at us.

824
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
And you never know whether the north of it in the maze

825
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
or the constructed south feed in the maze.

826
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But they all looked the same to me.

827
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000
And they still do.

828
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I'm never in Korea.

829
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I couldn't tell a difference between the north Korean and the south Korean.

830
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I still couldn't never tell a difference between the south.

831
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.000
The enemy is the north feed in the maze.

832
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It made me, there's a way, but I never figured it out.

833
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And so we just went in and constantly were searching and destroying.

834
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And if we find the enemy in strength, our job was to hold them there until General Peo and

835
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:46.000
get his infantry into helicopters and bring them in and really defeat the enemy.

836
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:53.000
On occasion we got in more of a firefight and we expected to be.

837
01:21:53.000 --> 01:22:00.000
But we generally were pretty good at finding them.

838
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:05.000
And the tanks were all right through this forest and knocked the trees right down.

839
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And it was no problem at all.

840
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And I was in my helicopter directing.

841
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
And you could see and you tell the tanks were to go.

842
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.000
And the tanks and the AKs, which were primarily what the unit was all about.

843
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And so we, that was our job.

844
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000
So often I read about units that were over there that never or very, very seldom would

845
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
they see the enemy.

846
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They would lose guys to sniper fire.

847
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
They'd lose guys to mortar fire.

848
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
They'd lose guys to booby traps.

849
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
But very seldom would they see the enemy.

850
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And obviously there's units that are different than that.

851
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
But it sounded like you were able to find the enemy on a fairly regular basis.

852
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Oh yes.

853
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Are they found us on that?

854
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Who finds who is not sure there's an answer to that.

855
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Yes, we were more often that we got in, we had contact.

856
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I had more than I would like to admit casualties, which didn't happen because they couldn't find the enemy.

857
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I can tell you they could find us, you know, often remember somebody at a long time

858
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
in my career tell me something about reconnaissance by fire.

859
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And I remember, well, the tank you had a lot of machine guns and you could do a lot of

860
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
reconnaissance by fire.

861
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And in the trouble of other reconnaissance by fires, you never know whether they see or not.

862
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
You just know there's somebody shooting at you.

863
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Well that's good enough.

864
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That's good enough.

865
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
You don't need any.

866
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.000
No, whether you're aiming at you or not.

867
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:15.000
When you, one of the things that also I talk about and I've read a lot about is the Vietnam War being very difficult

868
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
from a leadership perspective for some leaders, more than others, but because you had drafties.

869
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And you had drafties, not just drafties that got drafted and okay, I'm going to go do my duty,

870
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:35.000
but drafties that got drafted that literally did not believe in what was happening and barely even believed in America as a country.

871
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:42.000
How much of that did you see and what was your leadership approach to those troops?

872
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
I saw zero of them.

873
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I mean, I don't know.

874
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I was just absolutely lucky.

875
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I know I'm not that naive.

876
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000
I'll tell you, I, the last few guys have been talking to you in reading about this and,

877
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
and there's something that I've noticed a trend.

878
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000
So have you heard the term millennials about the new up and coming kids?

879
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I know what millennials are up.

880
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So people complain about, you know, especially from a leadership perspective, people talk to me about,

881
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
well, you know, I've got my company and we've got these new, these kids checking in their millennials.

882
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
They're different.

883
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.000
They're entitled.

884
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
They don't want to work as hard.

885
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And I started thinking about my head.

886
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
Well, basically you've got a, a work force.

887
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
That's a little bit different.

888
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000
And this is very similar to the drafty using Vietnam who had a different attitude.

889
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And what I found from good leaders is it didn't matter.

890
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
It didn't matter that they had drafty.

891
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
It's a matter of fact, a general mucuyama who I just talked about.

892
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
When I talked to, when I asked him about drafty, he said,

893
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
I didn't even know who was a drafty and who was a life.

894
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I couldn't tell the difference.

895
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And Colonel Hacord, Throden, his book, he wrote,

896
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
I love the drafties because they were straight shooters.

897
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
They didn't, when they weren't trying to protect their career,

898
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
they tell you what they thought.

899
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And you could take their input and you could do something good with it.

900
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I've said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

901
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
The soldiers I served with and three different wars got better.

902
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
And they were all drafties.

903
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I mean, I didn't never serve with an all volunteer outfit.

904
01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
They were all, no matter where I was, they were drafties.

905
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And they all did their job.

906
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I mean, I've never had anybody tell me when their job,

907
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
it wasn't this one, but they wanted to do.

908
01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
They just did it.

909
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
And I don't know if that's leadership or I don't,

910
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:51.000
but just, if just the way it was.

911
01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And they were all proud to be in our outfit.

912
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
I mean, now, I'm sure other people later on.

913
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I mean, I've heard of people later on in Vietnam,

914
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
having no problem with drugs.

915
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
And all I can, we didn't have any of that.

916
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Now, fortunately, I left in 1967.

917
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:21.000
So I'm not sure, things got worse perhaps.

918
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:29.000
But I think drugs, we are an issue period.

919
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000
But I don't know.

920
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
I didn't have any of that kind of a problem.

921
01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And as I said earlier, I'm not naive.

922
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I believe in knowing exactly what's going on.

923
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
What you find out is walk around and talk to people.

924
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000
You don't sit in your tents or in your helicopter.

925
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You've got to go and talk to the guy on the ground

926
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
and find out what tail's going on.

927
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And that's what, you know, there's a fellow wrote a book.

928
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
His name was Peters.

929
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
There's many years later.

930
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And he wrote the book.

931
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
It's called Management by Walking Around.

932
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And there's a guy made a fortune just doing what I used to do.

933
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I mean, it's scary.

934
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
But I mean, it's true.

935
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That's what leadership was all about.

936
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
It's fine out what's going on.

937
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And then, using some common sense to tell people,

938
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000
this is what you're supposed to do or give them some guidance.

939
01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But, I mean, people who used to tell me,

940
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
well, you know how to do things because you can order

941
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
with people to do things.

942
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And I'm saying, let me tell you something.

943
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Or learn a guide.

944
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You get out of a tent to fix the track

945
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
when somebody's shooting at you.

946
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It's not anybody who goes on to just do it.

947
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000
He's going to do it because he knows if you don't get the track fix.

948
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
We're going to get our ass killed.

949
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
I mean, we're going to get going.

950
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
He's going to do it because that's his job.

951
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And that may be leadership, but I'll tell you.

952
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:19.000
It's discipline that comes from people being trained right and taught right and treated right.

953
01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000
If you don't treat people right, they deserve to treat you wrong.

954
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And I'm a great believer in treating people the right way.

955
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I'm just from here and you talk about treating people the right way and listening to people.

956
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
You're, you know, you say when I told people to do stuff they did it.

957
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Well, yeah, that's because you treated them well.

958
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
You listen to them.

959
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
You have those relationships with your, with your troops.

960
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And that's what makes people like you said,

961
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
when you've got to have somebody that's going to go out and fix track

962
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
under fire, well, that's somebody that's not going to do that just because you order to do it.

963
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
You better have some some relationships.

964
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
You better have treated them well.

965
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And they must understand what the why on the mission is to like,

966
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
hey, why this is important.

967
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So when you, when you look back at World War Two,

968
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Korea, Vietnam, I was from a tactical perspective,

969
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
actually maneuvering troops.

970
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Is there any big lessons that you would think back of that you say,

971
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:29.000
this is something that I did consistently or this is something that I would never do because I knew it would cause problems?

972
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Hmm.

973
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:35.000
I can't think of anything.

974
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:39.000
I'll go back to what I said earlier.

975
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
I've always believed.

976
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
It may be this from growing up in Iowa.

977
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:50.000
I don't know. Just treat people like you'd like to be treated yourself.

978
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And it worked out.

979
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I don't know.

980
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I told you about my first sergeant,

981
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000
called me Fifi, which pissed me off right frankly.

982
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:14.000
But because he was a guy who didn't treat people like people like to be treated.

983
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And I always was amazed how much I exalted in the fact when he got busted.

984
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:27.000
I mean, we were in England on the way over to the continent.

985
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
He got busted for, I don't know what reason,

986
01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
but he got busted back to me, being a private.

987
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000
That's a big jump from first sergeant down to me and a private.

988
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And I was happy.

989
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Because I didn't think this guy was, he's also the guy when I took a test

990
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
to see what I could be smart enough to go to the military academy.

991
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
What the hell are you taking a test for like that for?

992
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
You're not smart enough to go to the West Point.

993
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And I always would like to be able to say to this guy, if I ever saw him again,

994
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I'm sure he's dead by now.

995
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I told you so.

996
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:16.000
But if you don't treat people like, they should be treated.

997
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:22.000
You deserve to be treated to the opposite way.

998
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
And I just always tried to practice that anyway.

999
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.000
And so far it's been relatively successful.

1000
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
That's a huge underpinning of leadership from everything I've seen.

1001
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Everything I've ever read, every person I've ever talked to.

1002
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:47.000
If you care about your people, you care about and you want to treat them well as human beings.

1003
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That's the underpinning that really makes leadership work.

1004
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
And it's a lot of times, and you mentioned this earlier, a lot of times from the civilian side,

1005
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.000
they think, well, in the military, you can just order people to do things and they'll just do it because you're the boss.

1006
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And that's not true.

1007
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
And it's actually when I got out of the military and I started working this civilian sector,

1008
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I thought to myself, well, if you didn't want, if you want somebody to do something and they don't do it, you can just fire.

1009
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
But that's not true either because guess what? You'll run out of people really quick.

1010
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And so what you have to do is you have to lead.

1011
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
So you have to do it.

1012
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
And one of those, the most core underpinnings of leadership is really caring about the people that work for you.

1013
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:35.000
And I think the more you care about them and I know for me, I cared more about my guys than I did about myself.

1014
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And I wanted to make sure that they were okay and that things were going to go well for them.

1015
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And that was always my priority, my real priority.

1016
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And I suppose someone that was very jaded might think, well, then you know, you're going to get passed over.

1017
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:54.000
You're not.

1018
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Things are going to work out good for you because you're more worried about your troops.

1019
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
And the opposite's actually true.

1020
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And my career was beautiful and all I ever tried to do is take care of the people that worked for me.

1021
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Because that's the way you get to be successful.

1022
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:23.000
You know, hiring people or working with people, you know, in civilian sector, you hire people.

1023
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
And the military, whoever arrived was that that was it.

1024
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I get people.

1025
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
But I've always said, your job is to make the boss successful.

1026
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
And vice versa, the boss's job is to make them successful.

1027
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
And if you work that works out for both of you.

1028
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And to me, leadership, you know,

1029
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.000
we talk about it.

1030
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
But it's easy if you follow a few basic principles.

1031
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.000
You don't have to have all the stuff that goes, I mean, people write books on leadership.

1032
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
You probably have written books on leadership yourself.

1033
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Well, yes indeed.

1034
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But the fact of that is there's some basics.

1035
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And you just expand on it.

1036
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You don't.

1037
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
It isn't that magic if you just follow a few basic principles.

1038
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
One of the things we talk about in the book actually is simple, not easy.

1039
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Yeah, because it is.

1040
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And we say that in our book as well as we didn't invent any of this.

1041
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
This is stuff that's been around.

1042
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And there's no eureka moments.

1043
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:41.000
And we're not claiming to have anything startlingly new.

1044
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
This is fundamental stuff that if you think about it.

1045
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It's some of it might be stuff you already do as a leader.

1046
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Some of the stuff that you know you should do as a leader.

1047
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And just make it clear for people to understand is is probably the only real benefit of the book itself.

1048
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Okay, this is good stuff.

1049
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Yeah.

1050
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
But nothing.

1051
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
No rocket science there.

1052
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I didn't need to be a whisk.

1053
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I can't promise you.

1054
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
So did you.

1055
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
You mentioned earlier when we were not recording that you actually ended up going back.

1056
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
You actually ended up going back to Vietnam as and were you a civilian at that time?

1057
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh yes, yes.

1058
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Well, my wife and I like to travel.

1059
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
So we've traveled most of the places in the world by now.

1060
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And she wanted to go back and see where I'd been in Vietnam.

1061
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:43.000
And that's one too sure about that.

1062
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
But anyway, we had this opportunity.

1063
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And so we went back and I went to Hanhoy, which was an experience.

1064
01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And I go to the Hanhoy Hilton and seeing how they've turned that into a propaganda place.

1065
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And I'm still remember seeing this picture on the wall of Senator McCain and a couple other guys I can't remember the names.

1066
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Another one was what a high school class made a mine.

1067
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
But day by name, who was an Air Force retired Colonel.

1068
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.000
He got to metal a boner.

1069
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:45.000
But anyway, and they were shown them in these white pants and white over shirt is if they were on a barbecue.

1070
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:54.000
You know, everything you've heard about the place was just and they showed you some of the cages that they had people in.

1071
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.000
We actually have had two guests on the podcast that were in the Noilhilton.

1072
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And one of them went back and was talking us through that same propaganda.

1073
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Went back to the Noilhilton as a civilian.

1074
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:18.000
And just the the feeling he had was pretty strong.

1075
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I can't imagine. But you know, when I was there, I was just seen it from the propaganda and what they were.

1076
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Because it's a big tourist attraction apparently for the the Vietnamese.

1077
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:47.000
And so we obviously saw it and the knew what it was and and for what it was.

1078
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000
And I hear all kinds of stories about the people that were there, you know, but.

1079
01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And then we went from there to the name and then down to a side gone.

1080
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And I'd hired a car and a guy to take us up back up to my own operational area.

1081
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:23.000
And drove through the mission of representation, which was sort of a fun experience to see.

1082
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Now it's no longer mission that's stayed on. They took over obviously from their friends, but looks exactly the same.

1083
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I mean trees are lined up, rubber trees just rubber trees, rubber trees.

1084
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And the people are out there working the trees.

1085
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And I don't know if you know this, which is this is an aside.

1086
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:54.000
You cannot burn a living rubber tree. It won't burn.

1087
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And I've tried hard.

1088
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I mean, I have two flimps or I said, and we tried hard to burn those trees down on the sides of the road.

1089
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Doesn't work.

1090
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And so anyway, we went back up to the old operation area in the same place.

1091
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I was pretty close to where I got wounded.

1092
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
When I was in Vietnam, I was in my helicopter flying over this river.

1093
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And I was pretty close to where that happened.

1094
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I could do that because I had to map coordinates of where I had been wounded before.

1095
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Otherwise, I'd guarantee I'd never be able to recognize a place like Tom.

1096
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:53.000
But my old base camp, which was because I had helicopters over there, had airfield.

1097
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And now being turned into a strip mall.

1098
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.000
So I washed all that happening. But it was seen side gone again.

1099
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
It was an amazing experience to see what they've done.

1100
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You see all these tall buildings now.

1101
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:24.000
But the one officer's club that was on the roof of one of the hotels is still there.

1102
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
They're exhausted the same. And my wife and I went up and I had lunch there.

1103
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:38.000
And my time before I went out to the unit, I used to go up there.

1104
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And we'd go up there and watch out here and see the savers, not savers.

1105
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
What do you call the rounds that are tracers? Tracers.

1106
01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Thank you. See all the tracers from being fired up and up and back down.

1107
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And you need to experience because you really weren't fighting the war.

1108
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
You mean, in Saigon.

1109
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:17.000
You know, it was so different from there when you went out into the field.

1110
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So it was fun to go back and see what they've done.

1111
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And I was impressed with how much the south fit and the knees have really been serious about getting real business and going.

1112
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And a lot of things happening. Business was up north.

1113
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
It's still a grand. It was still a grand at the time.

1114
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Very grand. You mean, very few tall buildings.

1115
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Very few businesses. And so that you can identify.

1116
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.000
And maybe it's still the same because that was 11 years ago now.

1117
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
But I don't know what's changed over there.

1118
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
But so the north fit in me's one the war sort of speak.

1119
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I say that with tongue and cheek actually.

1120
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
But they won the war.

1121
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:17.000
But I'm not sure that the south feet and the knees aren't coming back and taking over running the country.

1122
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
They certainly have the financial strength there.

1123
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And I hope that's a way that eventually will work out.

1124
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Well, the way the rest of the world's gone.

1125
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
It's been freedom and democracy and capital.

1126
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
It's eventually wins the long war.

1127
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Yeah.

1128
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And we've seen that worldwide. So hopefully it'll happen for them as well.

1129
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
How did you get wounded?

1130
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
You're third time getting wounded and Vietnam?

1131
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Well, I was one of the missions we had ever evening.

1132
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
We'd go into a perimeter.

1133
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:57.000
And most of the time we'd be in a perimeter around our children unit.

1134
01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.000
So they could fire at night without worrying about getting over a run.

1135
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And so I put all of our unit into its perimeter from my helicopter flying around.

1136
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And I noticed a bunch of sand pans evacuating here in the we had.

1137
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.000
So I thought in my John Wayne family,

1138
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
I'm going to go now and shoot some of these guys.

1139
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So I got to pilot.

1140
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
I was flying in this case in a two passenger.

1141
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
I mean, one passenger.

1142
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Bubble helicopter.

1143
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
And anyway, so I had this M40.

1144
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
You know what an M40 is?

1145
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:53.000
It's fires. It looks like a shotgun.

1146
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
So I'm up there.

1147
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
And I'm shooting at these guys in the same pan.

1148
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:06.000
And I'm doing pretty good, missing a lot, but in any of some.

1149
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
One of them shot back.

1150
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
And my God hit me.

1151
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000
In the leg.

1152
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And so I told the driver about taking me back down to the headquarters,

1153
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.000
which was what the squad and surgery was.

1154
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
He, I was never forget. He took my pants away.

1155
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000
And there was blood spurry right out all the way out,

1156
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:36.000
at least 18 inches from my leg.

1157
01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
I hit something they call as further.

1158
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And he said, this is a captain speaking to me.

1159
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Colonel, you got damn dumb son of a bitch.

1160
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000
You could be dead.

1161
01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
So anyway, he managed me up.

1162
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And the metal's still there.

1163
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Still in my leg.

1164
01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
But you were, you were turned to duty though, right?

1165
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Oh yeah. I mean, I had been in command more than 30 days.

1166
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
I was scared of death.

1167
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
I couldn't be evacuated.

1168
01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Hell, I had finished out my tour.

1169
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I mean, so.

1170
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
One of my friends named Tim Kennedy is a green barray.

1171
01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
And he has a TV show coming out called Hard to Kill.

1172
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I think maybe we need to get you on that show.

1173
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
No, no.

1174
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
No, somebody might take me up on it.

1175
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I mean, I, I, I've been fortunate.

1176
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I mean, a lot of people got hurt.

1177
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:43.000
A lot more seriously and I've been.

1178
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
And I've seen some.

1179
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
In fact, I've had too many hurt pretty seriously.

1180
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I had one of my.

1181
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
My.

1182
01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Exile was in the helicopter and got shot.

1183
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Up to the seat of the helicopter and all the strap and everything.

1184
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
What right into his leg and he was.

1185
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Forever.

1186
01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
In bad shape.

1187
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
I mean, I mean, so I've seen a lot of people

1188
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
get hurt pretty badly.

1189
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
I've been, I've been fortunate.

1190
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I mean.

1191
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But I'm also had the attitude.

1192
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I'm not going to get shot and killed.

1193
01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I mean.

1194
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
No, that's worked out.

1195
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:33.000
But.

1196
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Going back to.

1197
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
You know, when I got out of that tank to go back in Korea.

1198
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I had no more idea that I was going to kill.

1199
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.000
That wasn't going to enter into my mind.

1200
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
I just had something to do.

1201
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
And.

1202
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
That may be foolish.

1203
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000
But it's just the way it was.

1204
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Yeah, I think if you're.

1205
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
If you were thinking about.

1206
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
What could happen?

1207
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
You wouldn't do anything.

1208
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
You couldn't do anything.

1209
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
You went right.

1210
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Yeah.

1211
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
So you're.

1212
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:12.000
You wrap up your squadron commander and Vietnam.

1213
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And again, I mean, you were taking.

1214
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
How often would you guys you're getting in fire fights a lot?

1215
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000
What was your what was your cash rate of casualties like?

1216
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000
How many guys did you lose how many people were killed while you were there as a squadron commander?

1217
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
How many were killed?

1218
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Probably can.

1219
01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Not too many.

1220
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I mean.

1221
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
When you have a.

1222
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.000
A calves.

1223
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Do you know what a knee calf is?

1224
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
That's a personnel carrier.

1225
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
I mean, a calf stands for armored cavalry assault vehicle.

1226
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
But it's.

1227
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
It was M1 13's.

1228
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
That can those days.

1229
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I don't know.

1230
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I don't know what they're called.

1231
01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
We still used M1 13's.

1232
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
We used M1 13's in Ramadi.

1233
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000
The same exact.

1234
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So we we are very familiar.

1235
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
We both read in the back of them.

1236
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Well, they're pretty well protected.

1237
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.000
And the tanks are we have patent tanks and they're protected.

1238
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So yeah, we had casualties because.

1239
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.000
And in a cavalry troop.

1240
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
We have infantry right in the AKS.

1241
01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
So when they get out.

1242
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:36.000
But I don't know that statistics.

1243
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I wrote enough letters.

1244
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But not very.

1245
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I mean, one is more than enough.

1246
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But.

1247
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
I don't remember how many I wrote.

1248
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000
But because I did that for everybody was killed.

1249
01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
But I don't.

1250
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I don't know the statistics.

1251
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Not too many not overborn burdened.

1252
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I mean, in the sense it.

1253
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I got several people's names on the wall.

1254
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000
I go there every year.

1255
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Just just stand there.

1256
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000
But I don't know.

1257
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Jack, I don't know the answer.

1258
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I understand sir.

1259
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
When you got home from Vietnam, you know,

1260
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
you talked about coming home from Korea and everyone's in uniform.

1261
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And, you know, we hear stories of guys coming home from Vietnam.

1262
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
And they literally get told, don't wear you uniform around.

1263
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
How different was the reception from World War II,

1264
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
to Vietnam?

1265
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Well, coming back from Vietnam was a sad experience.

1266
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
We thought we'd been doing a good job.

1267
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:18.000
We thought we'd been doing the right job.

1268
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And I came back to the Pentagon.

1269
01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I sort of witnessed the experience of the country being up on arms about Vietnam.

1270
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:46.000
So, I didn't feel too appreciated, I guess, as the right word.

1271
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:54.000
And yet, I didn't feel like I'd been doing a good job.

1272
01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:03.000
So, I didn't have any bad feelings.

1273
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Most of those feelings about what was going on came after I got out.

1274
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So, I retired in 69 and things began to go to hell in the country about what we were doing over there.

1275
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Well, right after I got out, I guess.

1276
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:36.000
My job when I got out, I mean, when I came home was,

1277
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I was in the second tier of defense at this level.

1278
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I told you earlier, the Army sent me to school to learn to contact the Wizkis.

1279
01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Well, guess what?

1280
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
When I came back, Army sent me to be a Wizkid.

1281
01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I was a stand-up to the second tier of the general staff,

1282
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Alan Antoven's organization, which was called Systems Analysis.

1283
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000
And that's for all the Wizkis were.

1284
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:16.000
And they had a representative of the Army Navy Air Force Brinkore, all four of us.

1285
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And we were sure of the other energy that Tito taught were.

1286
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
We were, we were supposed to balance some of these smart young men that were the,

1287
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000
the, quote, Wizkis. And as I've told people, I've never wiser a kid,

1288
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
but I was in that organization.

1289
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And it was an experience.

1290
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
They wouldn't let me work on anything Army.

1291
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And I had, because they knew I had to go back to the Army.

1292
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:55.000
See, that was, and you had to be sitting there making decisions that could be against the Army.

1293
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
What the Army wanted to be as opposed.

1294
01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:07.000
One of the things I was involved with, because I was involved with the Navy in the Air Force,

1295
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.000
the Navy wanted to build another nuclear submarine.

1296
01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Well, it's only so many capital ships that was by law.

1297
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:27.000
And so they'd be, I asked why there was, I can't remember.

1298
01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And I think 13 capital ships, so what over the number was?

1299
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I asked, why is that number 13?

1300
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
It took quite a while for them to figure out the answer.

1301
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
And it really was very simple.

1302
01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:48.000
We've gone back to the League of Nations, probably in Tito's, I mean, in 1920 to something.

1303
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:55.000
When they, they've partly doubted to the various World War of One winners,

1304
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
the number of capital ships.

1305
01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
I called battleships.

1306
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Numbers of ships that each country would have.

1307
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:05.000
And that's where the, this number came from.

1308
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Well, I, that was just, uh, now, I learned to ask that question,

1309
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:22.000
because when I was going to Michigan, one of, one of the professors said,

1310
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000
this was in statistics class.

1311
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I want to know what, you want to, what, not what the results are.

1312
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
I want to know what the assumptions are.

1313
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.000
And so I was asking this assumption, why is there,

1314
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
X number of capital ships?

1315
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
It was a simple question.

1316
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I, I didn't know I was creating a challenge.

1317
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
I mean, it, it turned out to be exactly what I was saying.

1318
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000
It was a strange phenomenon for the,

1319
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.000
the time to try to figure out why that number.

1320
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I don't know what the world is now, but I can tell you, at that point,

1321
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.000
this was the 1968, I guess.

1322
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:15.000
It was a question that they took a wild answer.

1323
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
By the way, I don't know how many capital ships we have.

1324
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I don't know what they're called today, but we have a lot more than I think we had

1325
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
back in those days.

1326
01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
So what made you decide to retire?

1327
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Well, I had 25 years in the military.

1328
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And I decided I wanted to think about doing something else.

1329
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Part of it was, I used to listen to people, tell me,

1330
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000
you just order people to do things they do it.

1331
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
So that's, there's a lot of bologna.

1332
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:59.000
So I wanted to go and see, got my,

1333
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:05.000
if you would, teeth on, try and something in civilian work world.

1334
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000
So I started a bunch of resumes out,

1335
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:19.000
I eventually, was hired to go down to Texas.

1336
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:26.000
And, fellow that hired me was retired,

1337
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
maybe a reader.

1338
01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:36.000
By the way, as an aside, I was assigned to the first squadron,

1339
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I think it's called, that flew jets off of aircraft carriers.

1340
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Got my name in Felix, to Blonsky.

1341
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
It was a wonderful man.

1342
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.000
But if you wanted to know what time it was,

1343
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
he'd tell you how to build the watch.

1344
01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:10.000
He hired me and our job there was to figure out how to use

1345
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
from LTV's computer resources,

1346
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
how to use these in civilian application.

1347
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:30.000
And, one of the things we did was we developed

1348
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:37.000
for Dallas, exes and owes that they used to do on the

1349
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:43.000
job board on the computer screen.

1350
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.000
It just became a way that apparently,

1351
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Dallas cobblestone would teach a guy's how to react

1352
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
to whatever police it was.

1353
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
So, that was using some of this fancy technology

1354
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
that LTV had to build something that was

1355
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
applicable in civilian life.

1356
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Well, the length of LTV, the length, the tip of what?

1357
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:20.000
It's only got challenged because he was creating a huge empire

1358
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:25.000
and the anti-trust people got after him.

1359
01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:30.000
And all of a sudden, our arm was part that I was in,

1360
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
was one for 30 people to four.

1361
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And I was one of the four.

1362
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:38.000
And I don't know to this day, I still don't know why they can't.

1363
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I just been there less than a year.

1364
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:47.000
But the guy who tried to hire me into computer sciences

1365
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:53.000
previously, offered me a job with computer sciences.

1366
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Even though I had a job, I knew that this place was not a

1367
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
place that long-term could be.

1368
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:03.000
So, I went to work for computer sciences,

1369
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
and there's been 15 years there.

1370
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
And it returned from there.

1371
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:13.000
It's one of the presidents, one of their divisions.

1372
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:21.000
And one of the things that my bosses used to say,

1373
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I was one of the few leaders they had.

1374
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.000
But a lot of managers, but I was leading a group.

1375
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And we came very successful.

1376
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Much more so that I ever imagined we could be.

1377
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
It was primarily in sales and marketing.

1378
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And I had a boss that said, who was from my B.M.

1379
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:47.000
and strict IBM suit kind of guy.

1380
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
You know, you've heard all stories about him.

1381
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:55.000
And he said, he said, if I were to go back to my comrades that I

1382
02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:00.000
B.M. and tell them that I just hired the former Army Colonel

1383
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000
to be at a sales, they'd all think I was God damn crazy.

1384
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And so, anyway, I had a great career at computer sciences.

1385
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
And as I said, I retired from there.

1386
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And I'm not a typist.

1387
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000
When I was going to high school, if you took typing,

1388
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
you weren't going to college.

1389
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It was back.

1390
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
So this thing called voicemail appeared to me.

1391
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000
And I said, so another fill on I started a company

1392
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:43.000
in the voicemail business, 1984.

1393
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:48.000
And it was pretty successful.

1394
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000
And we sold it in 1998.

1395
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And I stopped working since then.

1396
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:04.000
Well, that is awesome.

1397
02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:07.000
And I know we've kept you here for a couple hours now.

1398
02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And probably a good place to at least stop for this particular session.

1399
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Is there anything else you want to say anything else you want to close out with?

1400
02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Well, I can say this.

1401
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I met my wife on my first assignment from the Pentagon.

1402
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.000
And my job in the Pentagon, among other things, was to control the number of

1403
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
troops on the ground in Vietnam.

1404
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Congress mandated that we 550,000 people on the ground.

1405
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
My job was to be sure that that number was met.

1406
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.000
So when the Secretary of Defense went to Fort Congress, he could always say

1407
02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
that we have never purchased.

1408
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
So on a quarterly basis, I would go to Hawaii.

1409
02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:04.000
And people from Hawaii, Thailand, Korea, Philippines, and Hawaii would all meet

1410
02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.000
at the headquarters in the Hill.

1411
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And we'd go over, because when Westmore and a lot to replace an

1412
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.000
ACAC at Batai and whether it's infantry Batai and different numbers and everything is different.

1413
02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So we had to do all this monitoring and keeping track of how many troops we had.

1414
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
My wife was a schoolteach in California, and she was over their own

1415
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
vacation.

1416
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.000
And one of my former colleagues from Vietnam, she knew him.

1417
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:44.000
And some of them were met.

1418
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:48.000
In the next two years, we dated cross country.

1419
02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000
She didn't California meet in the Pentagon.

1420
02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And I would go every quarter to the Hawaii and I was for this meeting.

1421
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I'm telling you about.

1422
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.000
So I plan the meeting to be started on Tuesday.

1423
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
So I could fly from here to California.

1424
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
I spend some time with her.

1425
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Then I fly off to Hawaii and I was.

1426
02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
And then on the way back, I'd stop until the same thing.

1427
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Then it'd be up back here.

1428
02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:24.000
So anyway, we got married in 19, after I got out retired in 69.

1429
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.000
And we got married in October, 69.

1430
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And the reason I was still living today is because of her.

1431
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:38.000
She keeps me alive.

1432
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
She keeps carrying me.

1433
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000
So she's the principal reason that I can sit here and talk to you.

1434
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Well, then we'll say thank you to you for coming on.

1435
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
And we'll say thank you to your wife for getting you here.

1436
02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Because sir, once again, this has just been an absolute honor to be able to talk to you.

1437
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
To be able to hear the stories and the lessons that you learned and thank you.

1438
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Well, from all of us for your service, your sacrifice.

1439
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And it's been an honor.

1440
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Well, you all deserve the honor.

1441
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I mean, you guys, I don't know what it would be like to be in the service today.

1442
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Frankly, I see these guys.

1443
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:42.000
My nephew deployed six times twice to Iraq once for the Somali extraction.

1444
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Plus three other times, he just deployed you know.

1445
02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Now, how he did this, I'll never know, but he never left Camp Pendleton.

1446
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I mean, he did, he was a drill sergeant down at MCRD.

1447
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:07.000
But he could move back to Pendleton.

1448
02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I mean, his wife lived there the whole time.

1449
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
He's 20 years in the Marine Corps.

1450
02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
All the same.

1451
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I never figured that out.

1452
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.000
I moved around like, but my wife would tell you.

1453
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
She, she and I got married after I got her.

1454
02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
We're in our 17th house.

1455
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.000
We've only been married for him almost 49 years.

1456
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.000
I mean, so everybody said, well, you were in the military.

1457
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
We didn't do this.

1458
02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
She was never in the military.

1459
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
We moved all the time since then.

1460
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
I mean, you stay in San Diego.

1461
02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
I'll do my best.

1462
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I'll do my best.

1463
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
And again, yeah, absolutely the troops that are out there today.

1464
02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
And there's a lot of troops that listen to this.

1465
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Guys out there holding the line and doing those deployments over and over again.

1466
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:09.000
But, you know, the work that we do today is based on the lessons that we learn from your generations from the three wars that you fought.

1467
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:15.000
And what you passed on to us, and it was an honor for us to continue to carry the flag.

1468
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
So thank you.

1469
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Thank you.

1470
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Keep carrying it.

1471
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Yes, sir.

1472
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And Colonel Tom Fife has departed.

1473
02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:29.000
And obviously it is an honor to get to talk to him.

1474
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000
And thanks for setting that up, Dave.

1475
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Yeah, man, that was awesome.

1476
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Much appreciated three war veteran.

1477
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
I mean, come on.

1478
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Come on.

1479
02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
That's just unbelievably awesome to sit and listen to.

1480
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
And you know what?

1481
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Thanks, Dave for setting that up.

1482
02:07:47.000 --> 02:08:02.000
And also thanks to everyone that that supports this podcast so that we have the opportunity to bring people on like Colonel Tom Fife and be able to share those lessons on which there was a ton in there.

1483
02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So thank you all for supporting and echo.

1484
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
If people do want to support.

1485
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Sure.

1486
02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Can you maybe feel something on how to do that?

1487
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Sure.

1488
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Let me start with our company.

1489
02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Oh, origin.

1490
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
That's the company.

1491
02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Origin main.com is the website.

1492
02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
There you can get.

1493
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Jocquad is supplement.

1494
02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
You can get Jocquad supplements.

1495
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Jocquad super krill oil for your joints.

1496
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Joint warfare for your joints don't run out by the way.

1497
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Dave Burke.

1498
02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You're I don't know if you've been on the in the situation of running out of super krill when you depend on super krill.

1499
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
That's a bad situation.

1500
02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
And if you ever want to reduce the risk of running out do the subscriptions.

1501
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
That's what I do.

1502
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Kind of subscription subscription.

1503
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
You just get your allotted amount per month or however often you need it.

1504
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Also pre-mission supplement.

1505
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
It's called discipline.

1506
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Hold on Dave, you're firing up on discipline.

1507
02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:13.000
You said you said to me and I quote, I live on discipline.

1508
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Yeah, it has become a daily part of my life for sure.

1509
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
You've got it in the brain.

1510
02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Yep.

1511
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:20.000
You use it before you work.

1512
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Yep.

1513
02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
You're studying your work and you're prepping.

1514
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
That's your go to.

1515
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000
The stuff is awesome.

1516
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I use it probably more than I should.

1517
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Yeah.

1518
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000
It's a joke.

1519
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I don't know if there's a some kind of a, you know, limitation health wise.

1520
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Like if you're drinking nine gallons a day.

1521
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I'm going to make gallons.

1522
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I'll let you know.

1523
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Yeah.

1524
02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Yeah.

1525
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Check.

1526
02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
All right.

1527
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Well, there it is.

1528
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
It's a great, everything.

1529
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Pre-mission.

1530
02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Pre-workout.

1531
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Pre-testing.

1532
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Pre-juditsu.

1533
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Now you're going to get mad or whatever or you're going to make, you give me your attitude.

1534
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Because you know, you make fun of me because I want to get to taste good.

1535
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Yeah.

1536
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
You make fun of me.

1537
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Yeah.

1538
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And there's not even that much I can say about that because it's a legitimate thing.

1539
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:09.000
For me, be jocled to be like, I want it to taste good.

1540
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
It's kind of a weakness, right?

1541
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
It's kind of soft.

1542
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Right.

1543
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Well, that being said, we have another flavor coming.

1544
02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I'm going to tell you what.

1545
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Well, first of all, it's a two-thicks.

1546
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
First of all, it tastes good.

1547
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Yeah.

1548
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
I know, best.

1549
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Second of all, it's, it's, it's basically peanut collagan.

1550
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.000
But I can't call it that.

1551
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
And that's like, I can't do that.

1552
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Yeah.

1553
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I can't do that.

1554
02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
So it's going to be called the coconut pineapple.

1555
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Sure.

1556
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Just straight peanut collagan.

1557
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Because I just can't.

1558
02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
No, no.

1559
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000
This is not, that's not how.

1560
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Yeah.

1561
02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
No, that's not how.

1562
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Yeah.

1563
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
You did mention that.

1564
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:53.000
And I'm impressed that you're sticking with the delicious, luxurious, tasty, really good.

1565
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But that's one of those things.

1566
02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Like, you like peanut collagan.

1567
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.000
You like that flavor.

1568
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Like, I've heard of people not really liking it.

1569
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.000
But that could have to do with the fact that you know how like when you drink

1570
02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
alcohol too much.

1571
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And it has like a, like, to kill a little habit.

1572
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You know, you know, if you just drink too many of them, you get drunk.

1573
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Yeah.

1574
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.000
It's very, very.

1575
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Now you can never drink it again.

1576
02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
No, if you smell it, you feel off.

1577
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
You know, I think it's a killer right now.

1578
02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:17.000
To kill it is like that.

1579
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
That's for sure.

1580
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000
You agree with it.

1581
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Yeah, yeah.

1582
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I don't agree with it.

1583
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:24.000
During my younger years, I had like a 14 month hiatus from the egg.

1584
02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
After I had a, that's it.

1585
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Yeah, that's it.

1586
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Yeah, that's it.

1587
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Yeah, that's what peanut collagan is.

1588
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
That's what I'm doing.

1589
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:31.000
That's what I'm doing.

1590
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:32.000
That's what I'm doing.

1591
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
You know what, young stupid and motivated.

1592
02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Yeah.

1593
02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Like you know, you're actually motivated to go over to do this.

1594
02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
That's a bad.

1595
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Sure.

1596
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Dumb.

1597
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Yeah.

1598
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:49.000
But if you haven't had that experience with peanut collagan, I would assume that that's a, that's a pretty high rate of acceptance as far as deliciousness goes in my opinion.

1599
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Or in my, by my estimation, I think my hypothesis or whatever.

1600
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Nonetheless, it's called disciplines.

1601
02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Pre-mission this, whether you love peanut collagan or love lemon lime,

1602
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
ish flavor with other delicious factors in it.

1603
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
That's a good thing, but it's good because it makes your brain more healthy.

1604
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.000
And your body, pre-mission pre-workout, pre-test, taking pre-meeting, pre-judicatory,

1605
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
workout, cognitive, and physical force multiplier.

1606
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
That's what that is.

1607
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:23.000
So get on now and of course, also, Giz and rashguards, Dave Burke.

1608
02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
You need to talk about milk.

1609
02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Yeah.

1610
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000
You missed the milk.

1611
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Yeah.

1612
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
I didn't really miss it. I was going to save it for last, but not at all.

1613
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Okay.

1614
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:33.000
I'll get on. I'll get back in my lane over here.

1615
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000
No, because I just had a whole thing I was going to do with it.

1616
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Raskar, it's telling me about it.

1617
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I feel like we should do the milk now, because you've got kind of kind of

1618
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:43.000
brought it up, which is, you know, if for lack of a better term,

1619
02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.000
it's actually, it is a better term.

1620
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.000
It's not protein part.

1621
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
It's protein powder, but it's a better term for this particular protein powder.

1622
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Moke.

1623
02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Yeah.

1624
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Mint chocolate.

1625
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Just kissy.

1626
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.000
The dog is the Crimean.

1627
02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:58.000
You're still in the milk?

1628
02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Yeah.

1629
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
He's not the milk, and he just told me he's going to get it this week.

1630
02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Well, I will say this.

1631
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
I never was into protein powder.

1632
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Aside from, you're still in my school.

1633
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
You're still not.

1634
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I'm still...

1635
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
You went to milk.

1636
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Red, correct, correct.

1637
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
But, this one is one of those good ones where kind of like you in the discipline

1638
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
where you're like pounding at all the time.

1639
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So, I give my daughter Dzerk, right.

1640
02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Oh, yeah.

1641
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
This is a dessert.

1642
02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Straight up straight up?

1643
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Yeah.

1644
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.000
It tastes that good.

1645
02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.68
I'll put a couple of drops of it in there.

1646
02:13:26.68 --> 02:13:27.52
Try to do that.

1647
02:13:27.52 --> 02:13:31.12
But two drops of vanilla put an egg and put it in the blender.

1648
02:13:31.12 --> 02:13:32.64
They're swear to me.

1649
02:13:32.64 --> 02:13:34.04
In fact, you know what, don't do it.

1650
02:13:34.04 --> 02:13:34.88
Don't do it.

1651
02:13:34.88 --> 02:13:36.12
You'll do it in the same boat as me.

1652
02:13:36.12 --> 02:13:37.76
That's when the last is like a dessert.

1653
02:13:37.76 --> 02:13:39.64
And there's protein, not it's good, man.

1654
02:13:39.64 --> 02:13:42.28
Because I used to make these milk shakes when I was young.

1655
02:13:42.28 --> 02:13:43.64
Like, I just homemade milk shake.

1656
02:13:43.64 --> 02:13:45.000
You more swallow.

1657
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Probably.

1658
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:47.80
Probably.

1659
02:13:47.80 --> 02:13:49.000
Victor.

1660
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.24
And the last thing used to make these milk shakes when I was young,

1661
02:13:51.24 --> 02:13:57.24
they were, they had vanilla, egg, like a teeny tiny piece of banana, milk.

1662
02:14:00.84 --> 02:14:03.24
And some other stuff, some sugar in there.

1663
02:14:03.24 --> 02:14:04.08
And it was good.

1664
02:14:04.08 --> 02:14:05.48
It was like a solid milk shake.

1665
02:14:05.48 --> 02:14:06.20
Like good.

1666
02:14:06.20 --> 02:14:08.08
Like almost like you bled it from a gourmet spot.

1667
02:14:08.08 --> 02:14:11.08
Well, the milk is no joke when it comes to milk shake simulator.

1668
02:14:11.08 --> 02:14:11.92
Yeah.

1669
02:14:11.92 --> 02:14:13.76
Mint, mint chocolate.

1670
02:14:13.76 --> 02:14:14.92
Your favorite peanut butter is coming.

1671
02:14:14.92 --> 02:14:15.92
Peanut butter is chocolate.

1672
02:14:15.92 --> 02:14:17.60
Chocolate peanut butter is coming.

1673
02:14:17.60 --> 02:14:20.48
Chocolate peanut butter, milk is on its way.

1674
02:14:20.48 --> 02:14:22.88
Straight up, deep brick when you get on it, you're going to stand that.

1675
02:14:22.88 --> 02:14:25.84
So you're just going to be pounding discipline and milk all day.

1676
02:14:25.84 --> 02:14:27.12
The way they break.

1677
02:14:27.12 --> 02:14:28.12
Only days break.

1678
02:14:28.12 --> 02:14:29.12
Like an echo.

1679
02:14:29.12 --> 02:14:30.12
Easy to look like echo Charles.

1680
02:14:30.12 --> 02:14:31.12
Yeah.

1681
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:32.12
So all in.

1682
02:14:32.12 --> 02:14:33.12
Six months, dude.

1683
02:14:33.12 --> 02:14:34.12
Lift the engine to milk.

1684
02:14:34.12 --> 02:14:35.12
All that stuff.

1685
02:14:35.12 --> 02:14:37.76
Also, geese and rash guards.

1686
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:38.76
We can talk about that.

1687
02:14:38.76 --> 02:14:42.12
If you want, unless you have another suggestion on what else I should talk about.

1688
02:14:42.12 --> 02:14:45.12
I'm saying, I want to do the right thing over here.

1689
02:14:45.12 --> 02:14:46.40
No, I'm saying, Dave Burke.

1690
02:14:46.40 --> 02:14:47.96
Kind of give you a good day for work.

1691
02:14:47.96 --> 02:14:48.96
You do get your right.

1692
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:49.96
I do.

1693
02:14:49.96 --> 02:14:53.56
So the one good thing about starting geogitsi with 45.

1694
02:14:53.56 --> 02:14:59.20
I discovered the one good thing about it and said starting at 15 is I never have any

1695
02:14:59.20 --> 02:15:03.12
of those stories where I tell about how uncomfortable the gear is or how the rash guards

1696
02:15:03.12 --> 02:15:04.12
get me.

1697
02:15:04.12 --> 02:15:05.92
You know, or the geese are hard to wash.

1698
02:15:05.92 --> 02:15:08.88
I got origin maingees time to from the geogitsi.

1699
02:15:08.88 --> 02:15:10.24
From the get going out of the geogitsi.

1700
02:15:10.24 --> 02:15:14.28
There's like someone that never had a flip phone in 1994.

1701
02:15:14.28 --> 02:15:16.000
Just woke up and they had an iPhone 6.

1702
02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Starting with the iPhone 10.

1703
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Yeah.

1704
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000
You're just out of the geogitsi.

1705
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:23.12
I don't know what it's like to have grown up with all that terrible gear you guys

1706
02:15:23.12 --> 02:15:24.12
use.

1707
02:15:24.12 --> 02:15:26.12
You know what it was like in the day.

1708
02:15:26.12 --> 02:15:27.12
Yeah.

1709
02:15:27.12 --> 02:15:28.12
Yeah.

1710
02:15:28.12 --> 02:15:34.64
Well, that's actually good news in my opinion, you know, because working, not working,

1711
02:15:34.64 --> 02:15:40.28
but working out and doing you just in a junkie, rather first gear head, man.

1712
02:15:40.28 --> 02:15:44.20
You know, like you ever, when you buy your first suit, same deal.

1713
02:15:44.20 --> 02:15:45.20
Like you don't know.

1714
02:15:45.20 --> 02:15:46.20
I don't know.

1715
02:15:46.20 --> 02:15:47.20
I don't know.

1716
02:15:47.20 --> 02:15:48.20
Just like that.

1717
02:15:48.20 --> 02:15:49.20
Like, oh, I see go to the school.

1718
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:50.20
I'll even go buy one.

1719
02:15:50.20 --> 02:15:51.20
I don't know.

1720
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:52.20
Whatever.

1721
02:15:52.20 --> 02:15:52.20
So same thing.

1722
02:15:52.20 --> 02:15:54.20
So I went and bought a gear and it was like, I bought a cheap one.

1723
02:15:54.20 --> 02:15:55.20
Yeah.

1724
02:15:55.20 --> 02:15:56.20
40 bucks.

1725
02:15:56.20 --> 02:15:57.20
No, no straight.

1726
02:15:57.20 --> 02:15:59.20
See, I bought my first gear was in a key.

1727
02:15:59.20 --> 02:16:01.20
I bought from the Akito store.

1728
02:16:01.20 --> 02:16:02.20
Yeah.

1729
02:16:02.20 --> 02:16:04.20
Because the geogitsi place, they were like a 200 bucks.

1730
02:16:04.20 --> 02:16:06.20
I'm like, oh, go, not happening.

1731
02:16:06.20 --> 02:16:07.20
I've a find a different one.

1732
02:16:07.20 --> 02:16:08.20
Yeah.

1733
02:16:08.20 --> 02:16:09.20
I found this cheap one.

1734
02:16:09.20 --> 02:16:10.20
On bleached.

1735
02:16:10.20 --> 02:16:11.20
Have you ever heard of this?

1736
02:16:11.20 --> 02:16:12.20
Unbleached cotton.

1737
02:16:12.20 --> 02:16:14.20
That was even cheaper in the bleached cotton.

1738
02:16:14.20 --> 02:16:15.20
It's an off-white.

1739
02:16:15.20 --> 02:16:16.20
Yeah.

1740
02:16:16.20 --> 02:16:17.20
It feels like it's filled with steel wool.

1741
02:16:17.20 --> 02:16:18.20
Scratching it in your skin.

1742
02:16:18.20 --> 02:16:19.20
Yeah.

1743
02:16:19.20 --> 02:16:20.20
But that's hard.

1744
02:16:20.20 --> 02:16:23.20
And it lasted like four weeks.

1745
02:16:23.20 --> 02:16:24.20
So yeah, get a quality gear.

1746
02:16:24.20 --> 02:16:26.20
It's a bit more ginkae.

1747
02:16:26.20 --> 02:16:27.20
That was a key to the key.

1748
02:16:27.20 --> 02:16:28.20
It was an Akito gear.

1749
02:16:28.20 --> 02:16:29.20
It looked.

1750
02:16:29.20 --> 02:16:36.20
It felt similar from the external viewpoint to a jitter ge.

1751
02:16:36.20 --> 02:16:37.20
But it wasn't.

1752
02:16:37.20 --> 02:16:41.20
And it damn sure wasn't made in America.

1753
02:16:41.20 --> 02:16:42.20
Made in Maine.

1754
02:16:42.20 --> 02:16:46.20
You know what's awesome is to know to literally know the people.

1755
02:16:46.20 --> 02:16:49.20
Because we've been in the factory.

1756
02:16:49.20 --> 02:16:51.20
I know the people that made those.

1757
02:16:51.20 --> 02:16:52.20
I know them.

1758
02:16:52.20 --> 02:16:53.20
Yeah.

1759
02:16:53.20 --> 02:16:54.20
I like I say, oh, hey, how you doing?

1760
02:16:54.20 --> 02:16:56.20
Oh, I'm over here making a geek.

1761
02:16:56.20 --> 02:16:56.20
Yeah.

1762
02:16:56.20 --> 02:16:57.20
That's real.

1763
02:16:57.20 --> 02:16:58.20
That's what's happening.

1764
02:16:58.20 --> 02:16:59.20
Yeah.

1765
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:01.20
And on top of that, that's mentioned.

1766
02:17:01.20 --> 02:17:02.20
The cotton.

1767
02:17:02.20 --> 02:17:04.20
That was loomed right there in the building.

1768
02:17:04.20 --> 02:17:05.20
That's right.

1769
02:17:05.20 --> 02:17:06.20
It's from America too.

1770
02:17:06.20 --> 02:17:07.20
That's something.

1771
02:17:07.20 --> 02:17:09.20
And you said, I was talking about peed about this.

1772
02:17:09.20 --> 02:17:10.20
The cotton.

1773
02:17:10.20 --> 02:17:12.20
It's not all cotton.

1774
02:17:12.20 --> 02:17:13.20
It's.

1775
02:17:13.20 --> 02:17:14.20
What is it?

1776
02:17:14.20 --> 02:17:15.20
Poly.

1777
02:17:15.20 --> 02:17:17.20
So it's a poly cotton blend.

1778
02:17:17.20 --> 02:17:20.20
And I thought that the two strands were different.

1779
02:17:20.20 --> 02:17:22.20
And it's woven together.

1780
02:17:22.20 --> 02:17:27.20
No, they make that that actual thread is cotton.

1781
02:17:27.20 --> 02:17:28.20
Poly cotton.

1782
02:17:28.20 --> 02:17:35.20
The thread itself that you weave is that's why that's why you can put it in the dryer to dry like a normal piece of clothing.

1783
02:17:35.20 --> 02:17:36.20
Not four hours.

1784
02:17:36.20 --> 02:17:39.20
You pull it out and you stuff the hang it up because it's all cotton.

1785
02:17:39.20 --> 02:17:41.20
It just holds on to the water.

1786
02:17:41.20 --> 02:17:42.20
It gets out of there.

1787
02:17:42.20 --> 02:17:43.20
Yeah.

1788
02:17:43.20 --> 02:17:44.20
Made in America.

1789
02:17:44.20 --> 02:17:45.20
So yeah.

1790
02:17:45.20 --> 02:17:46.20
You.

1791
02:17:46.20 --> 02:17:47.20
Good.

1792
02:17:47.20 --> 02:17:48.20
Good.

1793
02:17:48.20 --> 02:17:49.20
Dave Burke.

1794
02:17:49.20 --> 02:17:50.20
Boom.

1795
02:17:50.20 --> 02:17:52.20
Origin.

1796
02:17:52.20 --> 02:17:53.20
Geey.

1797
02:17:53.20 --> 02:17:56.20
No history of discomfort in other geese.

1798
02:17:56.20 --> 02:17:57.20
No.

1799
02:17:57.20 --> 02:17:58.20
No.

1800
02:17:58.20 --> 02:17:59.20
Stinky.

1801
02:17:59.20 --> 02:18:00.20
Area of the house.

1802
02:18:00.20 --> 02:18:02.20
Where wet geese are hanging up for four days.

1803
02:18:02.20 --> 02:18:03.20
Yep.

1804
02:18:03.20 --> 02:18:04.20
Yeah.

1805
02:18:04.20 --> 02:18:06.20
And I'll say this for all the stuff at Origin.

1806
02:18:06.20 --> 02:18:07.20
Everything they make is awesome.

1807
02:18:07.20 --> 02:18:09.20
On their website to talk about the hoodie.

1808
02:18:09.20 --> 02:18:11.20
They call it the most comfortable hoodie ever.

1809
02:18:11.20 --> 02:18:12.20
Yeah.

1810
02:18:12.20 --> 02:18:13.20
I grew up 100%.

1811
02:18:13.20 --> 02:18:16.20
And the most comfortable hoodie I've ever owned.

1812
02:18:16.20 --> 02:18:17.20
So that stuff is legit.

1813
02:18:17.20 --> 02:18:18.20
No joke.

1814
02:18:18.20 --> 02:18:19.20
No.

1815
02:18:19.20 --> 02:18:22.20
No personal offense to you Dave because I respect you.

1816
02:18:22.20 --> 02:18:23.20
I do.

1817
02:18:23.20 --> 02:18:24.20
I really respect you as a person.

1818
02:18:24.20 --> 02:18:28.20
But your level of measuring comfort is not even close to echo.

1819
02:18:28.20 --> 02:18:31.20
Echo is sort of the quality comfort control guy.

1820
02:18:31.20 --> 02:18:33.20
And he has already made this statement.

1821
02:18:33.20 --> 02:18:36.20
So you saying it is like everyone is listening on whatever.

1822
02:18:36.20 --> 02:18:37.20
Yeah.

1823
02:18:37.20 --> 02:18:38.20
You're in the Marine Corps.

1824
02:18:38.20 --> 02:18:39.20
You've done some.

1825
02:18:39.20 --> 02:18:41.20
You've, you know, you've done some tough stuff in your life.

1826
02:18:41.20 --> 02:18:43.20
They're looking at echo.

1827
02:18:43.20 --> 02:18:44.20
They're like wait.

1828
02:18:44.20 --> 02:18:45.20
If echo thinks it's gonna go.

1829
02:18:45.20 --> 02:18:46.20
We're in.

1830
02:18:46.20 --> 02:18:47.20
Yeah.

1831
02:18:47.20 --> 02:18:49.20
That actual statement is meaning.

1832
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:50.20
Yeah.

1833
02:18:50.20 --> 02:18:51.20
Yeah.

1834
02:18:51.20 --> 02:18:52.20
But I will say, you know, sure.

1835
02:18:52.20 --> 02:18:54.20
Like, of course, Dave Burke, of course.

1836
02:18:54.20 --> 02:18:55.20
You know, you know, I, yeah.

1837
02:18:55.20 --> 02:18:57.20
I am the gold standard of comfort.

1838
02:18:57.20 --> 02:18:58.20
The evaluation for sure.

1839
02:18:58.20 --> 02:18:59.20
I think.

1840
02:18:59.20 --> 02:19:00.20
And I will second that.

1841
02:19:00.20 --> 02:19:03.20
It is the hoodie and the pants by the way.

1842
02:19:03.20 --> 02:19:05.20
So yeah.

1843
02:19:05.20 --> 02:19:06.20
Get those as well.

1844
02:19:06.20 --> 02:19:07.20
All made in America.

1845
02:19:07.20 --> 02:19:10.20
The compression gear and rash guards.

1846
02:19:10.20 --> 02:19:13.20
All that I'm just saying there's all this stuff on the website.

1847
02:19:13.20 --> 02:19:14.20
Origin main.com.

1848
02:19:14.20 --> 02:19:15.20
Get all this stuff.

1849
02:19:15.20 --> 02:19:20.20
The hoodie, the geese, the rash guards, sweatpants, other stuff.

1850
02:19:20.20 --> 02:19:21.20
A lot of cool stuff on there.

1851
02:19:21.20 --> 02:19:22.20
Check it out.

1852
02:19:22.20 --> 02:19:23.20
You want something?

1853
02:19:23.20 --> 02:19:24.20
Get something.

1854
02:19:24.20 --> 02:19:26.20
Also, the immersion camp.

1855
02:19:26.20 --> 02:19:27.20
Do you just a camp?

1856
02:19:27.20 --> 02:19:28.20
Boom.

1857
02:19:28.20 --> 02:19:30.20
Just got a message from someone from Florida.

1858
02:19:30.20 --> 02:19:32.20
Young lady from Florida saying it.

1859
02:19:32.20 --> 02:19:35.20
Saying, I want to go to the immersion camp.

1860
02:19:35.20 --> 02:19:37.20
But I won't know anyone there.

1861
02:19:37.20 --> 02:19:39.20
And you know, they're just.

1862
02:19:39.20 --> 02:19:40.20
They only won from Florida.

1863
02:19:40.20 --> 02:19:41.20
What do you think?

1864
02:19:41.20 --> 02:19:43.20
Hey, you know me kind of.

1865
02:19:43.20 --> 02:19:45.20
I guess if you've sent me the message sure, you know me.

1866
02:19:45.20 --> 02:19:46.20
Probably no chocolate too.

1867
02:19:46.20 --> 02:19:49.20
Well, if you know echo you know me and that means you know they're Burke.

1868
02:19:49.20 --> 02:19:50.20
No three of us.

1869
02:19:50.20 --> 02:19:51.20
Three people already.

1870
02:19:51.20 --> 02:19:52.20
We're all right.

1871
02:19:52.20 --> 02:19:53.20
Rolling.

1872
02:19:53.20 --> 02:19:57.20
And here's the good thing where when you go there, we technically sure

1873
02:19:57.20 --> 02:19:59.20
new each other and you new Pete.

1874
02:19:59.20 --> 02:20:01.20
That was the first time I met Pete.

1875
02:20:01.20 --> 02:20:04.20
I met probably what?

1876
02:20:04.20 --> 02:20:07.20
Like the first 15 minutes.

1877
02:20:07.20 --> 02:20:10.20
We met about 20 people.

1878
02:20:10.20 --> 02:20:11.20
Yeah.

1879
02:20:11.20 --> 02:20:16.20
And we hung out with those 20 people plus the other people you meet over the days, the whole time.

1880
02:20:16.20 --> 02:20:18.20
He wasn't the kind like, oh, I don't really know that.

1881
02:20:18.20 --> 02:20:20.20
And I'm hanging over here and there over there.

1882
02:20:20.20 --> 02:20:21.20
It wasn't.

1883
02:20:21.20 --> 02:20:22.20
It's not like that.

1884
02:20:22.20 --> 02:20:24.20
You ever heard of those like dating sites?

1885
02:20:24.20 --> 02:20:25.20
No, seriously.

1886
02:20:25.20 --> 02:20:26.20
You put in like match.

1887
02:20:26.20 --> 02:20:27.20
Well, you look at it.

1888
02:20:27.20 --> 02:20:28.20
Okay.

1889
02:20:28.20 --> 02:20:29.20
So I grew up before dating sites.

1890
02:20:29.20 --> 02:20:30.20
Or I got married before dating sites.

1891
02:20:30.20 --> 02:20:33.20
So I was just like, do the game back in the day.

1892
02:20:33.20 --> 02:20:36.20
Like you got to go to a place where you can hopefully meet a girl.

1893
02:20:36.20 --> 02:20:37.20
Right?

1894
02:20:37.20 --> 02:20:43.20
The odds of meeting a girl are not the girl that you like and that has some sort of remotely similar interest.

1895
02:20:43.20 --> 02:20:49.20
You go into a bar of the hundred girls in there and like you're lucky if there's one of them there that's remotely interested in what you're interested in.

1896
02:20:49.20 --> 02:20:50.20
And you can connect.

1897
02:20:50.20 --> 02:20:51.20
Then you got to meet them.

1898
02:20:51.20 --> 02:20:52.20
You got to go up and talk to them all the stuff.

1899
02:20:52.20 --> 02:20:53.20
It's real hard.

1900
02:20:53.20 --> 02:20:58.20
Then they made the match dating things online where you put in your stuff.

1901
02:20:58.20 --> 02:20:59.20
Yeah.

1902
02:20:59.20 --> 02:21:01.20
And then you meet that one person.

1903
02:21:01.20 --> 02:21:04.20
And you connect with them and you have all these things in common.

1904
02:21:04.20 --> 02:21:06.20
This situation, you think about it.

1905
02:21:06.20 --> 02:21:09.20
You're actually just going into a place where everyone's into the same thing that you're into.

1906
02:21:09.20 --> 02:21:12.20
It's like walking to a bar and everyone likes the same stuff.

1907
02:21:12.20 --> 02:21:12.20
Right.

1908
02:21:12.20 --> 02:21:15.20
Like you get to and wants to train and wants to hang out.

1909
02:21:15.20 --> 02:21:17.20
And that's that's what makes it cool.

1910
02:21:17.20 --> 02:21:18.20
Yeah.

1911
02:21:18.20 --> 02:21:18.20
Yeah.

1912
02:21:18.20 --> 02:21:20.20
No dating typically.

1913
02:21:20.20 --> 02:21:21.20
But hey, yeah.

1914
02:21:21.20 --> 02:21:22.20
Yeah.

1915
02:21:22.20 --> 02:21:23.20
It's a good point.

1916
02:21:23.20 --> 02:21:24.20
Everyone kind of.

1917
02:21:24.20 --> 02:21:28.20
You kind of converge on the topic of.

1918
02:21:28.20 --> 02:21:30.20
You get to and then kind of everything else.

1919
02:21:30.20 --> 02:21:32.20
It's what it really seemed like to meet.

1920
02:21:32.20 --> 02:21:34.20
And then everything spends back to you.

1921
02:21:34.20 --> 02:21:35.20
Yeah.

1922
02:21:35.20 --> 02:21:36.20
Yeah.

1923
02:21:36.20 --> 02:21:37.20
It's good fun.

1924
02:21:37.20 --> 02:21:40.20
So my input is to go.

1925
02:21:40.20 --> 02:21:41.20
That's what I think.

1926
02:21:41.20 --> 02:21:42.20
I think go.

1927
02:21:42.20 --> 02:21:43.20
When it now go.

1928
02:21:43.20 --> 02:21:44.20
It's going.

1929
02:21:44.20 --> 02:21:45.20
I'm going.

1930
02:21:45.20 --> 02:21:46.20
Life is going.

1931
02:21:46.20 --> 02:21:47.20
Good.

1932
02:21:47.20 --> 02:21:48.20
Confirmed.

1933
02:21:48.20 --> 02:21:49.20
JPE's considering.

1934
02:21:49.20 --> 02:21:50.20
Oh, go.

1935
02:21:50.20 --> 02:21:51.20
Help probably end up going.

1936
02:21:51.20 --> 02:21:52.20
Yeah.

1937
02:21:52.20 --> 02:21:53.20
So it will be a little.

1938
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:57.20
EF reunion tour of the shoes.

1939
02:21:57.20 --> 02:21:58.20
It's a boy.

1940
02:21:58.20 --> 02:21:59.20
Yep.

1941
02:21:59.20 --> 02:22:00.20
Great.

1942
02:22:00.20 --> 02:22:01.20
And when you go there knowing zero.

1943
02:22:01.20 --> 02:22:05.20
You'll leave there not only knowing more people, but they'll be kind of your friends.

1944
02:22:05.20 --> 02:22:09.20
I will guarantee you'll have more actual friends after you leave guaranteed.

1945
02:22:09.20 --> 02:22:10.20
This is too.

1946
02:22:10.20 --> 02:22:11.20
To the lady that.

1947
02:22:11.20 --> 02:22:12.20
That's what I think.

1948
02:22:12.20 --> 02:22:13.20
That's what I think.

1949
02:22:13.20 --> 02:22:14.20
That's good.

1950
02:22:14.20 --> 02:22:15.20
That's good.

1951
02:22:15.20 --> 02:22:20.20
And even if you will know some people there, I say go to because you can't immerse yourself in.

1952
02:22:20.20 --> 02:22:21.20
You get to best with a learn.

1953
02:22:21.20 --> 02:22:23.20
And you know, let's face it.

1954
02:22:23.20 --> 02:22:24.20
You're in Maine.

1955
02:22:24.20 --> 02:22:25.20
It's a bunch of lobster.

1956
02:22:25.20 --> 02:22:27.20
They served lobster.

1957
02:22:27.20 --> 02:22:28.20
Yeah.

1958
02:22:28.20 --> 02:22:30.20
That was one of the highlights of my opinion.

1959
02:22:30.20 --> 02:22:31.20
Anyway, yeah.

1960
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:34.20
So it is on August 26 through September 2nd.

1961
02:22:34.20 --> 02:22:35.20
Two sessions.

1962
02:22:35.20 --> 02:22:36.20
Go to both if you want.

1963
02:22:36.20 --> 02:22:37.20
But yeah.

1964
02:22:37.20 --> 02:22:38.20
Two sessions.

1965
02:22:38.20 --> 02:22:39.20
There you go.

1966
02:22:39.20 --> 02:22:40.20
All levels.

1967
02:22:40.20 --> 02:22:42.20
Also for fitness gear.

1968
02:22:42.20 --> 02:22:44.20
Going to on it.com slash jockel.

1969
02:22:44.20 --> 02:22:46.20
They got kettlebells, battle ropes.

1970
02:22:46.20 --> 02:22:47.20
Jump ropes.

1971
02:22:47.20 --> 02:22:48.20
All kinds of stuff.

1972
02:22:48.20 --> 02:22:49.20
Good stuff.

1973
02:22:49.20 --> 02:22:50.20
Very up your workout.

1974
02:22:50.20 --> 02:22:51.20
Get some new gear.

1975
02:22:51.20 --> 02:22:55.20
It'll actually get you more in the mood to do a workout when that gear comes in.

1976
02:22:55.20 --> 02:22:56.20
I guarantee that.

1977
02:22:56.20 --> 02:22:58.20
Well, I don't know if I can guarantee that.

1978
02:22:58.20 --> 02:23:00.20
But that's how it was for me when I got the jump rope.

1979
02:23:00.20 --> 02:23:02.20
Then all of a sudden I'm a jump rope.

1980
02:23:02.20 --> 02:23:04.20
It seems like it's good.

1981
02:23:04.20 --> 02:23:05.20
Anyway, a lot of cool stuff on there.

1982
02:23:05.20 --> 02:23:07.20

I've been to Spotify.

2014
02:24:04.20 --> 02:24:07.20
There's a lot more apps for podcasts now.

2015
02:24:07.20 --> 02:24:08.20
Yeah.

2016
02:24:08.20 --> 02:24:09.20
And I think I'm going to explore some of them too.

2017
02:24:09.20 --> 02:24:10.20
Daily.

2018
02:24:10.20 --> 02:24:11.20
Yeah.

2019
02:24:11.20 --> 02:24:12.20
I'm like, smell some of them.

2020
02:24:12.20 --> 02:24:13.20
Come to daily.

2021
02:24:13.20 --> 02:24:14.20
Yeah.

2022
02:24:14.20 --> 02:24:16.20
Well, either way, the point there is to change their thing.

2023
02:24:16.20 --> 02:24:17.20
What do you mean?

2024
02:24:17.20 --> 02:24:19.20
There's their layout or something.

2025
02:24:19.20 --> 02:24:21.20
So now it pops up different.

2026
02:24:21.20 --> 02:24:22.20
Everything's different now.

2027
02:24:22.20 --> 02:24:23.20
It's interesting.

2028
02:24:23.20 --> 02:24:26.20
It's interesting.

2029
02:24:26.20 --> 02:24:27.20
I know.

2030
02:24:27.20 --> 02:24:29.20
It's like you ever realize when you the layout of something.

2031
02:24:29.20 --> 02:24:30.20
So this is a big thing on Facebook.

2032
02:24:30.20 --> 02:24:31.20
When do you get on Facebook?

2033
02:24:31.20 --> 02:24:32.20
Did you remember?

2034
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:34.20
2014.

2035
02:24:34.20 --> 02:24:35.20
14.

2036
02:24:35.20 --> 02:24:36.20
Dang.

2037
02:24:36.20 --> 02:24:37.20
That's that's pretty.

2038
02:24:37.20 --> 02:24:38.20
It's a requirement for school.

2039
02:24:38.20 --> 02:24:39.20
Okay.

2040
02:24:39.20 --> 02:24:40.20
There you go.

2041
02:24:40.20 --> 02:24:46.20
So were you in on Facebook when they kind of changed the layout of Facebook from something

2042
02:24:46.20 --> 02:24:47.20
to something to like news feed?

2043
02:24:47.20 --> 02:24:48.20
Like a jockey.

2044
02:24:48.20 --> 02:24:49.20
Oh, jockey doesn't know anything.

2045
02:24:49.20 --> 02:24:50.20
What?

2046
02:24:50.20 --> 02:24:52.20
You know what I'm talking about at all, huh?

2047
02:24:52.20 --> 02:24:55.20
No, I didn't get on Facebook for until probably like 2000.

2048
02:24:55.20 --> 02:24:58.20
I was might have been on, but I didn't actively do anything on it

2049
02:24:58.20 --> 02:25:00.20
till like maybe a year ago.

2050
02:25:00.20 --> 02:25:01.20
Yeah.

2051
02:25:01.20 --> 02:25:02.20
Okay.

2052
02:25:02.20 --> 02:25:03.20
So maybe a year and a half.

2053
02:25:03.20 --> 02:25:06.20
So the layout of Facebook was like, you know, you had your profile picture

2054
02:25:06.20 --> 02:25:08.20
and I even, I'm just trying to remember what it was.

2055
02:25:08.20 --> 02:25:10.20
It was like, I don't even remember what it was.

2056
02:25:10.20 --> 02:25:14.20
But it was like, I think like your wall or something like that

2057
02:25:14.20 --> 02:25:16.20
where it's like your just your own stuff.

2058
02:25:16.20 --> 02:25:20.20
And then they all of a sudden switched it to this news feed situation.

2059
02:25:20.20 --> 02:25:23.20
You know how like now it's like everyone's stuff that you're just,

2060
02:25:23.20 --> 02:25:24.20
basically how it is now.

2061
02:25:24.20 --> 02:25:25.20
They just switched it.

2062
02:25:25.20 --> 02:25:27.20
And people were mad.

2063
02:25:27.20 --> 02:25:29.20
It was like change their life.

2064
02:25:29.20 --> 02:25:30.20
You know, they were pissed.

2065
02:25:30.20 --> 02:25:34.20
That's what you sounded like when you just talked about the apples.

2066
02:25:34.20 --> 02:25:37.20
You know, you had that same effect on your brain.

2067
02:25:37.20 --> 02:25:39.20
Anyway, subscribe to the podcast what I'm saying.

2068
02:25:39.20 --> 02:25:44.20
Regardless of the layout of any iTunes or any other applications that the layout has

2069
02:25:44.20 --> 02:25:45.20
or has not changed.

2070
02:25:45.20 --> 02:25:47.20
Good way to support.

2071
02:25:47.20 --> 02:25:49.20
Also, whatever you do channel so subscribe to that.

2072
02:25:49.20 --> 02:25:53.20
If you want and if you're interested in the video version of this podcast,

2073
02:25:53.20 --> 02:25:56.20
you would, juggle looks like or Dave Burke.

2074
02:25:56.20 --> 02:25:58.20
In this case, what he looks like, pretty handsome.

2075
02:25:58.20 --> 02:26:02.20
I think as far as handsome goes or Colonel Tom Five.

2076
02:26:02.20 --> 02:26:03.20
Yes.

2077
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:04.20
See what he looks like.

2078
02:26:04.20 --> 02:26:07.20
Yeah, typically those are the ones that people want to see.

2079
02:26:07.20 --> 02:26:08.20
You know, they want to see the guests.

2080
02:26:08.20 --> 02:26:09.20
They want to see what they look like.

2081
02:26:09.20 --> 02:26:11.20
They know what we look like.

2082
02:26:11.20 --> 02:26:12.20
Yeah, they kind of already know.

2083
02:26:12.20 --> 02:26:14.20
Except me, I guess they don't really know what I look like.

2084
02:26:14.20 --> 02:26:17.20
Because it still do get hey, you don't look like how you sound.

2085
02:26:17.20 --> 02:26:18.20
Right.

2086
02:26:18.20 --> 02:26:20.20
You can look like how you sound.

2087
02:26:20.20 --> 02:26:22.20
Like you look like how you sound.

2088
02:26:22.20 --> 02:26:23.20
Jack.

2089
02:26:23.20 --> 02:26:24.20
Same.

2090
02:26:24.20 --> 02:26:25.20
Dave Burke looks how he sounds.

2091
02:26:25.20 --> 02:26:27.20
But it's not a one-to-one.

2092
02:26:27.20 --> 02:26:29.20
It's not a face to like your voice sounds like this.

2093
02:26:29.20 --> 02:26:31.20
So your face is going to look like that.

2094
02:26:31.20 --> 02:26:33.20
It's like your your voice sounds like this.

2095
02:26:33.20 --> 02:26:37.20
So your face can look like this kind of real like this group.

2096
02:26:37.20 --> 02:26:40.20
This little variety of faith possible faces.

2097
02:26:40.20 --> 02:26:42.20
You're just saying that's how it works.

2098
02:26:42.20 --> 02:26:44.20
But for you, your voice is not that.

2099
02:26:44.20 --> 02:26:47.20
My face is outside of that group apparently.

2100
02:26:47.20 --> 02:26:50.20
So if you're interested in that sort of thing,

2101
02:26:50.20 --> 02:26:51.20
YouTube boons.

2102
02:26:51.20 --> 02:26:52.20
Also have the excerpts on there.

2103
02:26:52.20 --> 02:26:55.20
If you want, you know, some of the lessons that Jack will talk about.

2104
02:26:55.20 --> 02:26:56.20
You know, you want to share them.

2105
02:26:56.20 --> 02:26:57.20
They're they're condensed.

2106
02:26:57.20 --> 02:26:59.20
Or actually they're not condensed.

2107
02:26:59.20 --> 02:27:01.20
They're just taken out of there.

2108
02:27:01.20 --> 02:27:03.20
You know, maybe little videos on there.

2109
02:27:03.20 --> 02:27:06.20
Also enhance the excerpts to put some music on there.

2110
02:27:06.20 --> 02:27:07.20
Make them more.

2111
02:27:07.20 --> 02:27:09.20
Somebody asked for tracks.

2112
02:27:09.20 --> 02:27:13.20
Enhanced excerpts in psychological warfare available on iTunes.

2113
02:27:13.20 --> 02:27:16.20
So, um, does that make sense?

2114
02:27:16.20 --> 02:27:17.20
Yeah, enhance the answers.

2115
02:27:17.20 --> 02:27:20.20
In the end, I think that's why I'm for psychological warfare too.

2116
02:27:20.20 --> 02:27:21.20
By the way, just why I agree.

2117
02:27:21.20 --> 02:27:22.20
I agree.

2118
02:27:22.20 --> 02:27:24.20
I agree on a lot of requests for things like that.

2119
02:27:24.20 --> 02:27:27.20
I agree, but not from a personal interest standpoint,

2120
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:29.20
because the psychological warfare.

2121
02:27:29.20 --> 02:27:31.20
One is still very effective.

2122
02:27:31.20 --> 02:27:34.20
100% effective for me.

2123
02:27:34.20 --> 02:27:35.20
Now with tracks.

2124
02:27:35.20 --> 02:27:36.20
Yeah.

2125
02:27:36.20 --> 02:27:40.20
Which I will talk about after I talk about the fact that

2126
02:27:40.20 --> 02:27:41.20
Jack was a store.

2127
02:27:41.20 --> 02:27:43.20
It's called Jocco store.

2128
02:27:43.20 --> 02:27:47.20
This is where you can get the T-shirts that say this will equals freedom like the one I'm wearing right now.

2129
02:27:47.20 --> 02:27:49.20
Or the Jocco podcast shirt.

2130
02:27:49.20 --> 02:27:50.20
Basic.

2131
02:27:50.20 --> 02:27:51.20
But very nice.

2132
02:27:51.20 --> 02:27:53.20
I want that date book is wearing right now.

2133
02:27:53.20 --> 02:27:57.20
Also, Mr. where you tell me you got called out with the Jocco podcast t-shirt.

2134
02:27:57.20 --> 02:27:58.20
Where was that?

2135
02:27:58.20 --> 02:27:59.20
I'm wearing this exact shirt.

2136
02:27:59.20 --> 02:28:03.20
I'm at Disney World with the family that's going to do these ago from across the way.

2137
02:28:03.20 --> 02:28:05.20
I get a good evening echo.

2138
02:28:05.20 --> 02:28:07.20
Yeah, that's the standard bona fides.

2139
02:28:07.20 --> 02:28:10.20
Yeah, that standard bona fides is good evening echo.

2140
02:28:10.20 --> 02:28:12.20
Very good.

2141
02:28:12.20 --> 02:28:13.20
Yeah, looks good on you.

2142
02:28:13.20 --> 02:28:14.20
Of course.

2143
02:28:14.20 --> 02:28:18.20
And even if you want to win the Jocco as on now, the one that Jocco always has on right now.

2144
02:28:18.20 --> 02:28:21.20
The one he has on right now and always has on.

2145
02:28:21.20 --> 02:28:22.20
You see what I'm saying?

2146
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:29.20
Anyway, if you want that shirt going jocco store.com or if you want a hoodie or if you want a hat or if you want a rash guard.

2147
02:28:29.20 --> 02:28:30.20
Anyway, just go in there.

2148
02:28:30.20 --> 02:28:33.20
You can see, you know, if you want to support that way, there's a lot of cool stuff on there.

2149
02:28:33.20 --> 02:28:35.20
If you want something, get something.

2150
02:28:35.20 --> 02:28:37.20
It's called jocco store.com.

2151
02:28:37.20 --> 02:28:41.20
Also, just like Jocco mentioned psychological warfare.

2152
02:28:41.20 --> 02:28:44.20
Isn't it album with tracks?

2153
02:28:44.20 --> 02:28:46.20
Basically, these tracks are each track.

2154
02:28:46.20 --> 02:28:48.20
You can get these on iTunes by the way.

2155
02:28:48.20 --> 02:28:53.20
So, each track is Jocco telling you how to get past certain weaknesses that you might have.

2156
02:28:53.20 --> 02:28:58.20
Might have on your campaign against weakness.

2157
02:28:58.20 --> 02:29:00.20
So, you know, you're on the path, right?

2158
02:29:00.20 --> 02:29:02.20
We're working out, we're waking up early, some of us.

2159
02:29:02.20 --> 02:29:05.20
And, you know, we're reading more, whatever we're doing.

2160
02:29:05.20 --> 02:29:06.20
Sometimes you don't want to do that.

2161
02:29:06.20 --> 02:29:07.20
You don't do that every day.

2162
02:29:07.20 --> 02:29:10.20
You just don't feel like it on some days, but you still should do it.

2163
02:29:10.20 --> 02:29:11.20
We all know that.

2164
02:29:11.20 --> 02:29:12.20
It's something that you don't feel like it.

2165
02:29:12.20 --> 02:29:13.20
So, you're about to skip the workout.

2166
02:29:13.20 --> 02:29:15.20
Boom, you listen to a certain track.

2167
02:29:15.20 --> 02:29:17.20
Jocco will tell you why you shouldn't skip the workout.

2168
02:29:17.20 --> 02:29:18.20
And it's effective.

2169
02:29:18.20 --> 02:29:19.20
You won't skip the workout.

2170
02:29:19.20 --> 02:29:20.20
Take it from me.

2171
02:29:20.20 --> 02:29:22.20
I know 100% from experience.

2172
02:29:22.20 --> 02:29:24.20
So, what it is, get it on iTunes.

2173
02:29:24.20 --> 02:29:26.20
Check.

2174
02:29:26.20 --> 02:29:28.20
You know, also speaking of subscribing?

2175
02:29:28.20 --> 02:29:31.20
I have another podcast now.

2176
02:29:31.20 --> 02:29:33.20
Yeah, it's called the Warrior Kid Podcast.

2177
02:29:33.20 --> 02:29:34.20
Good one.

2178
02:29:34.20 --> 02:29:35.20
Yeah.

2179
02:29:35.20 --> 02:29:37.20
Uncle Jake has lessons.

2180
02:29:37.20 --> 02:29:40.20
The name of the podcast is Warrior Kid Ask Uncle Jake.

2181
02:29:40.20 --> 02:29:45.20
Uncle Jake answers questions from little Warrior kids around the world.

2182
02:29:45.20 --> 02:29:47.20
And you can get that.

2183
02:29:47.20 --> 02:29:48.20
Play it for your kids.

2184
02:29:48.20 --> 02:29:49.20
There's no foul language.

2185
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:52.20
There's no talk about the me lie massacre.

2186
02:29:52.20 --> 02:29:54.20
It's totally separate to your kids.

2187
02:29:54.20 --> 02:29:59.20
And we'll get stumble upon something that they shouldn't be listening to that they're not ready for yet.

2188
02:29:59.20 --> 02:30:00.20
So, you can check that out.

2189
02:30:00.20 --> 02:30:04.20
Also, Jocco White Tea is available on Amazon.

2190
02:30:04.20 --> 02:30:12.20
And if you're going to order it, we'll then go ahead and just go ahead and order some more weights for your barbell too, because you're going to need them.

2191
02:30:12.20 --> 02:30:15.20
You need about 8,000 pounds worth.

2192
02:30:15.20 --> 02:30:18.20
And that's the minimum guaranteed deadlift.

2193
02:30:18.20 --> 02:30:20.20
Also, there's cans of white tea coming soon.

2194
02:30:20.20 --> 02:30:21.20
They're going to be here in June.

2195
02:30:21.20 --> 02:30:24.20
They're going to be available on Amazon in June.

2196
02:30:24.20 --> 02:30:25.20
Victory in a can.

2197
02:30:25.20 --> 02:30:26.20
Yes.

2198
02:30:26.20 --> 02:30:28.20
Certified organic.

2199
02:30:28.20 --> 02:30:30.20
Never thought you'd hear me say that.

2200
02:30:30.20 --> 02:30:31.20
That's not.

2201
02:30:31.20 --> 02:30:32.20
Yeah.

2202
02:30:32.20 --> 02:30:33.20
Certified organic.

2203
02:30:33.20 --> 02:30:40.20
We're going to get rid of all the horrible energy drinks that are out there, making people sick.

2204
02:30:40.20 --> 02:30:47.20
And we're going to place with Jocco White Tea, which is 8,000 pounds of pure power.

2205
02:30:47.20 --> 02:30:48.20
Let me ask you this.

2206
02:30:48.20 --> 02:30:49.20
Yes.

2207
02:30:49.20 --> 02:30:50.20
About Jocco White Tea.

2208
02:30:50.20 --> 02:30:56.20
Would you consider making the micro dose or a version that doesn't have just a micro dose of caffeine?

2209
02:30:56.20 --> 02:30:59.20
But if you drink the, no, probably not.

2210
02:30:59.20 --> 02:31:00.20
No more caffeine.

2211
02:31:00.20 --> 02:31:01.20
No.

2212
02:31:01.20 --> 02:31:03.20
The Jocco White Tea can.

2213
02:31:03.20 --> 02:31:05.20
I think it's two servings.

2214
02:31:05.20 --> 02:31:06.20
And I think it's 30 grams.

2215
02:31:06.20 --> 02:31:07.20
I'll confirm that.

2216
02:31:07.20 --> 02:31:08.20
Yeah.

2217
02:31:08.20 --> 02:31:09.20
I shouldn't have said it.

2218
02:31:09.20 --> 02:31:14.20
I don't think we've ever considered making like another, another version in the future or anything like that.

2219
02:31:14.20 --> 02:31:15.20
Something with more Jocco White Tea.

2220
02:31:15.20 --> 02:31:16.20
High person.

2221
02:31:16.20 --> 02:31:20.20
I don't know.

2222
02:31:20.20 --> 02:31:21.20
I don't think so.

2223
02:31:21.20 --> 02:31:22.20
Okay.

2224
02:31:22.20 --> 02:31:22.20
I don't think so.

2225
02:31:22.20 --> 02:31:26.20
Because if you want more, you can drink more.

2226
02:31:26.20 --> 02:31:27.20
Yeah, man.

2227
02:31:27.20 --> 02:31:28.20
Or go get something.

2228
02:31:28.20 --> 02:31:30.20
You know, something that's going to make you all drink it.

2229
02:31:30.20 --> 02:31:31.20
That's fine.

2230
02:31:31.20 --> 02:31:32.20
Okay.

2231
02:31:32.20 --> 02:31:34.20
Books weigh the warrior kid.

2232
02:31:34.20 --> 02:31:35.20
Series.

2233
02:31:35.20 --> 02:31:36.20
It's a series of books.

2234
02:31:36.20 --> 02:31:38.20
By the way, there's two of them right now.

2235
02:31:38.20 --> 02:31:39.20
There'd be more.

2236
02:31:39.20 --> 02:31:43.20
I got a, I got a note on.

2237
02:31:43.20 --> 02:31:45.20
Social media.

2238
02:31:45.20 --> 02:31:49.20
And it was from an eight year old warrior kid named Addison.

2239
02:31:49.20 --> 02:31:50.20
And she wrote this.

2240
02:31:50.20 --> 02:31:52.20
Dear Mr. Willink.

2241
02:31:52.20 --> 02:31:54.20
I absolutely love your book.

2242
02:31:54.20 --> 02:31:55.20
Way of the warrior kid.

2243
02:31:55.20 --> 02:31:58.20
I think it's the best book ever.

2244
02:31:58.20 --> 02:32:00.20
You know what I'm saying?

2245
02:32:00.20 --> 02:32:03.20
It taught me about discipline and commitment.

2246
02:32:03.20 --> 02:32:08.20
Now, every day I train before school and trust me, it helps a lot.

2247
02:32:08.20 --> 02:32:09.20
Your friend Addison.

2248
02:32:09.20 --> 02:32:10.20
So there you go.

2249
02:32:10.20 --> 02:32:12.20
Listen to Addison.

2250
02:32:12.20 --> 02:32:14.20
Pick up the way the warrior kid and pick up Mark's mission.

2251
02:32:14.20 --> 02:32:15.20
The second book.

2252
02:32:15.20 --> 02:32:17.20
So your kids can get stronger.

2253
02:32:17.20 --> 02:32:18.20
Smarter.

2254
02:32:18.20 --> 02:32:20.20
Faster and overall.

2255
02:32:20.20 --> 02:32:25.20
If you want to support a particular warrior kid, that's all in the move.

2256
02:32:25.20 --> 02:32:26.20
Making things happen.

2257
02:32:26.20 --> 02:32:29.20
Go to Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

2258
02:32:29.20 --> 02:32:30.20
Get some soap made by Aiden.

2259
02:32:30.20 --> 02:32:31.20
Warrior kid.

2260
02:32:31.20 --> 02:32:34.20
Warrior kid with his own business.

2261
02:32:34.20 --> 02:32:37.20
He makes Jocquoise hope on his farm.

2262
02:32:37.20 --> 02:32:39.20
So you can stay clean.

2263
02:32:39.20 --> 02:32:41.20
Don't forget about the discipline.

2264
02:32:41.20 --> 02:32:43.20
He equals a freedom field manual.

2265
02:32:43.20 --> 02:32:45.20
I met a trooper up in Yosemite.

2266
02:32:45.20 --> 02:32:46.20
I was up in Yosemite.

2267
02:32:46.20 --> 02:32:48.20
This was, I guess it was last summer.

2268
02:32:48.20 --> 02:32:51.20
And you know, we just started talking.

2269
02:32:51.20 --> 02:32:53.20
And I'm like, I was what you doing up here.

2270
02:32:53.20 --> 02:32:55.20
And he was like, I'm up here to get my mind right.

2271
02:32:55.20 --> 02:32:57.20
I was like, yeah, yeah.

2272
02:32:57.20 --> 02:32:58.20
I don't know.

2273
02:32:58.20 --> 02:32:59.20
I got kind of fired up, you know.

2274
02:32:59.20 --> 02:33:01.20
Get my mind right.

2275
02:33:01.20 --> 02:33:04.20
And that's the thing.

2276
02:33:04.20 --> 02:33:07.20
That's the thing that you kind of got to do sometimes.

2277
02:33:07.20 --> 02:33:09.20
Get your mind right.

2278
02:33:09.20 --> 02:33:11.20
This one equals freedom field manual.

2279
02:33:11.20 --> 02:33:14.20
It'll help get your mind right.

2280
02:33:14.20 --> 02:33:17.20
They'll help get your mind right.

2281
02:33:17.20 --> 02:33:18.20
Yeah.

2282
02:33:18.20 --> 02:33:20.20
It'll help get your body right, too.

2283
02:33:20.20 --> 02:33:24.20
By the way, if you get some of those deaf core workouts going for sure.

2284
02:33:24.20 --> 02:33:29.20
If you want to listen to it, instead of read it or in addition to reading it,

2285
02:33:29.20 --> 02:33:31.20
you have to do the audio version.

2286
02:33:31.20 --> 02:33:32.20
Not audible books.

2287
02:33:32.20 --> 02:33:34.20
It's not on there.

2288
02:33:34.20 --> 02:33:40.20
It's available on Amazon Music iTunes, Google Play, other MP3 platforms.

2289
02:33:40.20 --> 02:33:42.20
This one equals freedom field manual.

2290
02:33:42.20 --> 02:33:43.20
Meditate on that.

2291
02:33:43.20 --> 02:33:48.20
Also, for leadership, extreme ownership, combat leadership for the battlefield for business and life.

2292
02:33:48.20 --> 02:33:51.20
And now you can order the follow on book to extreme ownership.

2293
02:33:51.20 --> 02:33:53.20
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

2294

It's available for pre-order on Amazon Barnes and Noble, local bookstore, hit them up.

2296
02:34:01.20 --> 02:34:06.20
If you want to get one of those first editions, if you're a, if you're a book person,

02:34:11.20 --> 02:34:17.20
If you need backup with your team from a leadership perspective, whatever business you're in or whatever.

2301
02:34:17.20 --> 02:34:21.20
Leadership situation you're in, you need some support.

2302
02:34:21.20 --> 02:34:25.20
You can contact my leadership and management consulting company.

2303

It's me, Wavebab and JP to now.

The website is at www.satellonfront.com.

2307
02:34:34.20 --> 02:34:38.20
We solve problems through leadership.

2308
02:34:38.20 --> 02:34:40.20
That's it.

2309
02:34:40.20 --> 02:34:43.20
That's how problems could solve in any organization.

2310
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:45.20
Not some.

2311
02:34:45.20 --> 02:34:52.20
We're looking at a spreadsheet.

2312
02:34:52.20 --> 02:34:53.20
Sure, we'll assess those.

2313
02:34:53.20 --> 02:34:55.20
That's not where the problem's going to solve, though.

2314
02:34:55.20 --> 02:34:56.20
We might identify a problem there.

2315
02:34:56.20 --> 02:34:58.20
The problem is leadership.

2316
02:34:58.20 --> 02:35:01.20
The problem in your organization is leadership.

2317
02:35:01.20 --> 02:35:02.20
We'll fix it.

2318
02:35:02.20 --> 02:35:03.20
That's what we do.

2319
02:35:03.20 --> 02:35:05.20
Of course, we got the master.

02:35:05.20 --> 02:35:08.20
We're in DC right now for the master.

2321

It sold out and they all sell out.

2346
02:36:21.20 --> 02:36:22.20
Yep.

2347
02:36:22.20 --> 02:36:24.20
Your Twitter call sign.

2348
02:36:24.20 --> 02:36:25.20
That's it.

2349
02:36:25.20 --> 02:36:28.20
I might have snagged a good deal, Dave.

2350
02:36:28.20 --> 02:36:30.20
Just to make sure nobody else has it.

2351
02:36:30.20 --> 02:36:33.20
I might have grabbed that nicely done.

2352
02:36:33.20 --> 02:36:42.20
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and to all the military personnel out there.

2353
02:36:42.20 --> 02:36:48.20
Standing the global watch for evil.

2354
02:36:48.20 --> 02:36:49.20
Thank you.

2355
02:36:49.20 --> 02:36:56.20
And to the families of those men and women that are also serving and also sacrificing.

2356
02:36:56.20 --> 02:37:00.20
Thank you for what you do to the first responders out there.

2357
02:37:00.20 --> 02:37:03.20
Police law enforcement firefighters, paramedics.

2358
02:37:03.20 --> 02:37:07.20
Thanks for standing by to get some at all times.

2359
02:37:07.20 --> 02:37:11.20
And also thanks to your families as well.

2360
02:37:11.20 --> 02:37:17.20
And to everyone else that's out there with us.

2361
02:37:17.20 --> 02:37:20.20
Facing whatever you're facing.

2362
02:37:20.20 --> 02:37:26.20
Life challenges, struggles, pain, suffering, uncertainty.

2363
02:37:26.20 --> 02:37:29.20
Look at the past.

2364
02:37:29.20 --> 02:37:30.20
Look at the guy like Tom five.

2365
02:37:30.20 --> 02:37:31.20
Look what he's been through.

2366
02:37:31.20 --> 02:37:34.20
See what men and women have gone through.

2367
02:37:34.20 --> 02:37:39.20
What they've been subjected to and how over and over and over again.

2368
02:37:39.20 --> 02:37:46.20
We see human beings that rise against and they overcome.

2369
02:37:46.20 --> 02:37:50.20
To keep putting one foot in front of the other.

2370
02:37:50.20 --> 02:37:56.20
Keep fighting to move forward and keep getting after it.

2371
02:37:56.20 --> 02:38:06.20
And until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel out.
