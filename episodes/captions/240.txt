[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 240.
[00:00:03] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:06] Good evening, Echo.
[00:00:07] Good evening, and also doing us tonight.
[00:00:10] Once again, Dave Burke.
[00:00:13] Good evening, Dave.
[00:00:14] Good evening.
[00:00:15] All right, last podcast, which was podcast 2.39, in case you couldn't subtract one from
[00:00:22] 240.
[00:00:23] And I suppose we should give out some kind of shout out to the 240 Gulf.
[00:00:26] I don't know why, but we should.
[00:00:29] Shout out to all you machine gunners out there that ran that 240 Gulf.
[00:00:35] Last podcast, 239, we covered the first edition of combat lessons, rank and file in combat,
[00:00:43] what they do and how they do it.
[00:00:45] That was number one.
[00:00:46] And you know, to be honest, when I got done with that one, I said, yeah, that's cool.
[00:00:50] But there's more of them.
[00:00:52] And I kind of thought to myself, you know, well, how many combat lessons are there, right?
[00:00:58] I remember this is 240 podcast worth of combat lessons.
[00:01:03] But I was leaning towards, hey, probably not going to cover more of these things, because
[00:01:07] they're on more of them.
[00:01:08] And then I started reading number two.
[00:01:11] And as I read number two, kind of out of the gate section one, which is called leadership,
[00:01:16] and you just get, you just restart reading it.
[00:01:18] And before I knew it, I couldn't stop and there's more lessons, more perspectives,
[00:01:23] more angles, more knowledge to make us better.
[00:01:26] And I was really coming at this one.
[00:01:29] I was really thinking about life a lot, all aspects of life.
[00:01:33] And I think it's the opening of this that gave me that sort of mindset going through it.
[00:01:39] I was thinking about life, the parallels, or everywhere.
[00:01:43] All right, let's go to the book.
[00:01:46] And I think Dave, coming out of the gate, you're going to realize where, why I got so sucked
[00:01:52] into this thing, just out of the gate.
[00:01:53] So the first section, like I said, it's called leadership.
[00:01:56] And then the first subsection is leaders versus inertia.
[00:02:04] I was already, I was, you had me at inertia, as they say.
[00:02:08] Lieutenant Colonel, our E.O. Brian Cavalry observer with the fifth army in Italy.
[00:02:13] Here's what he says.
[00:02:15] In spite of the fact that I observed many interesting things in practice, in the practice
[00:02:20] of tactics and technique, still the one lesson that stands out in my mind above all others
[00:02:24] is the one that is so well-known by military men that it's statement here amounts to a little
[00:02:29] more than a platitude.
[00:02:30] I mentioned it however, because it had such a profound effect upon me, that lesson is the
[00:02:35] importance of and need for adequate leadership.
[00:02:41] So cool.
[00:02:42] I got through that.
[00:02:43] Fine, I wasn't quite there yet.
[00:02:46] And then I read this.
[00:02:48] The effect on most men of the impact of battle is to cause them to want to do nothing.
[00:02:59] A determined effort must be exerted to accomplish even simple tasks, and men are likely
[00:03:04] to neglect duties which they know must be performed.
[00:03:08] So think about that.
[00:03:10] Right out of the gate, right there.
[00:03:11] The effect of men in battle is that you're going to want to do nothing.
[00:03:15] And again, this is why I was talking about how this started making me think about life a
[00:03:19] lot.
[00:03:20] Think about that when it comes to life.
[00:03:23] How many people are just drawn towards the easy path not doing what you're supposed
[00:03:29] to do duties that you know must be performed but you neglect them.
[00:03:35] That's the difference between success and failure in life, by the way.
[00:03:38] Did you guys say in the Marine Corps why stand if you can sit, why sit if you can lay
[00:03:44] down?
[00:03:45] I'm going to say that in the Marine Corps.
[00:03:46] Similar.
[00:03:47] What do you guys say?
[00:03:48] I'm trying to think of the phrase but it's the same.
[00:03:50] I'm just like why do this when you can just do that?
[00:03:53] I never would say what I'm saying.
[00:03:54] But as soon as you say that, I know you were saying I was little thrown off by the title.
[00:03:58] Because you said leadership versus inertia.
[00:04:00] Now, it's thinking myself.
[00:04:02] Leadership kind of creates inertia.
[00:04:04] And when he's saying stand and the people who fall like Newtonian physics are going to
[00:04:08] laugh me out of the building.
[00:04:10] But it seems like what he's describing is the opposite of inertia sitting there doing nothing
[00:04:13] rather than moving in a direction.
[00:04:16] Or it's the you're fighting to keep it going.
[00:04:18] Yeah.
[00:04:19] And inertia moving.
[00:04:20] Yeah.
[00:04:21] He says there is no force other than a driving leadership to overcome this inertia.
[00:04:26] So he talks about inertia as the static being not moving.
[00:04:30] This tendency to carelessness and to infuse a determination to succeed in the minds of the
[00:04:35] individual men.
[00:04:37] When this spark of leadership is present, the individual knows that others feel it too.
[00:04:43] And that his effort is not alone.
[00:04:44] However, I was not a leader in this campaign.
[00:04:47] So I will quote an officer who is a successful commander in an infantry regiment, the wearer
[00:04:53] of a silver star an officer who has a fine reputation in his division.
[00:04:57] And here's what this officer says.
[00:05:01] This tell your people when you return that the hardest job they will have here is getting
[00:05:08] things done.
[00:05:10] My men know their weapons and tactics thoroughly.
[00:05:12] My effort is simply to require them to do the things they know must be done.
[00:05:19] Pusting security, dispatching patrols, seeking a field of fire, retaining their equipment
[00:05:24] and making sure that it is in working order.
[00:05:27] You have to check all the time.
[00:05:31] I believe it was Patton that said 90% of your job as a leader is making sure that the orders
[00:05:37] get executed.
[00:05:38] I'm sure that the things actually get done.
[00:05:42] So that opening right there is what kind of made me just say we need to talk about this.
[00:05:48] Because it's applicable so directly to us as human beings.
[00:05:55] And you know, I was talking about the gravitational pull.
[00:05:57] The gravitational pull, you ever seen the chart of the gravitational pull of when the
[00:06:01] space shuttle or something launches.
[00:06:03] I guess it's not the space shuttle.
[00:06:05] It's space X.
[00:06:06] Sure.
[00:06:07] Elon kicking those things up into space.
[00:06:11] But they use whatever.
[00:06:12] So massive amount of their power is to get the first whatever.
[00:06:18] My a lot.
[00:06:19] That's where they use 50% of their, I don't know what the percentage is.
[00:06:21] But it's a massive percentage of the power is to break free of the gravitational pull of
[00:06:25] the earth.
[00:06:26] They're one set of three of it.
[00:06:27] They're moving there.
[00:06:28] Okay.
[00:06:29] Like so much of the effort of a leader is just to get things to go.
[00:06:34] Get things to move.
[00:06:36] And we're going to get to this.
[00:06:37] There's definitely some things here.
[00:06:38] And we're about to roll into them where it talks about, you know, so much reliance on the
[00:06:44] leadership and in certain situations, you can see them leaning towards a micro management.
[00:06:53] You know, a hay, if I don't make this happen.
[00:06:55] But in all the parts of this book, they start talking about how the way that you're going
[00:07:00] to win is through individual efforts and individual leadership.
[00:07:03] So you get into decentralized command a little bit later.
[00:07:05] But I think it's one of those dichotomies.
[00:07:07] I think it's one of those dichotomies.
[00:07:08] In the matter of fact, I know it's a dichotomy that sometimes the phrase I used to use a
[00:07:14] lot and I used it a lot on this podcast was force of will.
[00:07:17] Right?
[00:07:18] Hey, you know, as a leader, I'm just going to make this happen.
[00:07:20] There is going to be a force of will.
[00:07:21] We are going to win this thing.
[00:07:22] We're going to go.
[00:07:23] I'm going to make this happen.
[00:07:24] And that's what he's talking about here.
[00:07:26] This force of will that you have to exert to make things happen.
[00:07:31] Even things that people know they should do.
[00:07:34] The next section, discipline.
[00:07:37] So right out of the gate, we're talking leadership and discipline.
[00:07:39] I was I was in there.
[00:07:41] The keys to success in combat, the key to success in combat, commanding general in a personal
[00:07:47] letter to Lieutenant General McNair.
[00:07:49] I would like to mention a few things I consider important in getting any prospective units
[00:07:54] ready for duty in Southwest Pacific.
[00:07:56] The first of all requisites is discipline with a capital D.
[00:08:03] I refer to discipline in all its phases.
[00:08:06] Water discipline, malaria discipline, personal appearance, military courtesy, the wearing of
[00:08:12] the uniform, personal and collective sanitation, carrying out orders in general, assumption
[00:08:19] and proper discharge of responsibility throughout the chain of command, etc.
[00:08:24] There's an inclination for men as well as some officers to go native in the tropics to
[00:08:29] let down mentally on material and spiritual values.
[00:08:34] So discipline is especially needed here.
[00:08:37] Need this to say I consider an aggressive offensive spirit always goes hand in hand with
[00:08:42] good discipline.
[00:08:45] So that's one of those things where we're talking about in post discipline.
[00:08:50] In some ways there, right?
[00:08:51] You make sure your weapons are clean.
[00:08:53] Make sure you're cleaning yourselves.
[00:08:54] There's a whole list of things.
[00:08:57] Make sure you're drinking water.
[00:08:58] Make sure you're cleaning your feet.
[00:09:01] Isn't that a weird one?
[00:09:02] Have you ever been in the water in the bush long enough to get like a really bad feet?
[00:09:08] No.
[00:09:09] I got a minor case of trench foot.
[00:09:14] When the guy who is my swim buddy during this particular long S&R operation, where we were
[00:09:20] a two man pair out there, just a training operation, but he got actual trench foot.
[00:09:24] He went to medical and they're like, oh yes, you have trench foot.
[00:09:28] It's weird that things like that.
[00:09:32] When you see talk to your guys about Vietnam, one of the main things that the officers
[00:09:37] would do is check guys feet because they wouldn't check on themselves.
[00:09:41] So even something that seems so obvious, like you'd want to take care of your feet,
[00:09:48] people will not make that little extra effort.
[00:09:51] The inertia for them is to say, you know what I'm just going to go to sleep with my boots
[00:09:55] on their wet.
[00:09:56] I'm not going to drop my feet.
[00:09:57] By the way, you can sleep with your boots on.
[00:09:58] I did.
[00:09:59] We would sleep with our boots on the field, but we take our socks off.
[00:10:03] We'd unlace our boots.
[00:10:05] So our feet are in there just kind of loose.
[00:10:06] They can kind of dry out a little bit.
[00:10:09] Hang your socks on a little tree or something nearby.
[00:10:13] But you don't want to get rolled up.
[00:10:14] Echoes are looking positive.
[00:10:15] You don't want to get rolled up in the field without your boots on.
[00:10:17] Okay.
[00:10:18] That makes sense.
[00:10:19] Figure rolled up in the field without your boots on.
[00:10:20] You got some problems to deal with.
[00:10:22] I can see that BTF Tony, you take one boot off.
[00:10:25] You fix whatever you've got to fix.
[00:10:26] And you put that boot back on, then you don't take both of them off.
[00:10:29] You're just sitting there.
[00:10:31] John McLean style.
[00:10:32] Basically make it.
[00:10:33] Oh yeah, that's a movie.
[00:10:35] Die hard.
[00:10:36] The first one.
[00:10:37] He runs on the glass.
[00:10:38] Yes, he wound up running over glass.
[00:10:41] How come he has to be a call without his boots on?
[00:10:43] Because when he arrived at Nakatomi Plaza, he at a request, not a request, a recommendation
[00:10:50] from a friend.
[00:10:52] Take off your shoes and you make fists in the carpet with your toes.
[00:10:55] It distresses you.
[00:10:56] That's what he was doing in the middle of this hijacking scenario.
[00:11:00] Interesting.
[00:11:01] You know, see, there are what I was thinking that this book had knowledge in it.
[00:11:06] Next, Lieutenant Colonel Clifton F. Con, 77th field artillery, and he lead the great
[00:11:17] stress placed upon discipline and the chain of command is not an overemphasis and never
[00:11:23] can be.
[00:11:24] We have found again and again that the highest standards of discipline are absolutely necessary
[00:11:28] in and out of combat.
[00:11:29] In no other way, can you be assured that the individual soldier will carry out orders without
[00:11:34] supervision and in combat this is essential.
[00:11:39] Again, we're talking about very stringent discipline.
[00:11:44] We're talking about imposed discipline.
[00:11:46] I mean, we are.
[00:11:48] It's called it like it is.
[00:11:49] Yeah, but the connection he's making is, is why I was thinking as you're talking
[00:11:52] out last passage, it's that connection to the imposed discipline that I'm going to start
[00:11:56] with.
[00:11:57] That's going to get you to recognize over time.
[00:12:00] What you need to do the self-discipline you need to create.
[00:12:03] And if your plan is like, I'm just going to make my folks self-discipline, you're
[00:12:06] actually going to skip the part where they learn why you have to do it.
[00:12:08] And sometimes that starts with, you're going to do this.
[00:12:11] You could explain it.
[00:12:13] But you asked me if I ever had immersion footer trench, but I never spent enough time in
[00:12:17] environment to have to deal with that.
[00:12:19] But I'll tell you my very first for smart, for smart, which is a five mile for smart,
[00:12:24] like a very short for smart and also candid school in 1991.
[00:12:28] We stopped 50 minutes into it.
[00:12:29] We all changed our socks.
[00:12:30] That's what we did.
[00:12:32] And so that's one example of, but it was totally imposed on us, but I was able to make
[00:12:37] that connection from these other people.
[00:12:40] And so you're telling the story about people that were non-combat ready because of that.
[00:12:44] But those lessons are all over the place in the military.
[00:12:47] And it's all search the same way, which is sit down, take your boots off, change your
[00:12:51] socks.
[00:12:52] And then over time you make the connection of, oh, I understand what I need to do this.
[00:12:56] So no, I never had it, but I was taught that lesson very early on.
[00:13:00] Yeah, there's some sort of, you know, obvious religious overtones too of, right, of
[00:13:07] like taking care of your men's feet, right?
[00:13:10] That's just a powerful thing.
[00:13:14] Next, the basis of good discipline.
[00:13:15] One of our problems has been to get junior officers and young NTO sufficiently hard-boiled
[00:13:21] to exact from their subordinates and meticulous obedience to every order.
[00:13:27] We must ingrain in all ranks the realization that orders are not to be treated as suggestions,
[00:13:32] but as concrete facts calling for the utmost effort until they have been carried out.
[00:13:38] So many people seem to feel that orders which are inconvenient or unpopular are to be
[00:13:44] disregarded.
[00:13:45] And this is one of those things.
[00:13:47] Hard for me to read this because we're always telling people, look, the military is not
[00:13:51] this thing.
[00:13:52] We're just someone barks orders of you and everyone just obeys, which it's not.
[00:13:57] This state of mind is a disease and must be eliminated.
[00:14:01] So what this section says or what this individual is saying, and I don't know if this is
[00:14:06] the same guy talking because it's not broken out.
[00:14:09] But then it says this, then it says this.
[00:14:13] On the other hand, so we got dichotomy and elimination, presupposes that all commanding
[00:14:20] officers and staffs take care that the orders they issue are consistent, correct, and
[00:14:26] capable of being carried out.
[00:14:28] So that's a very discrete way of saying, if you give me an order, that's not consistent,
[00:14:36] not correct and not capable of being carried out, I'm not going to follow it.
[00:14:40] That's what that says.
[00:14:42] They do it in a very roundabout way.
[00:14:44] They're very cautious about how they said that because they know they had Colonel Pog and
[00:14:47] the room there or right this.
[00:14:49] And Colonel Pog said, these bad need to listen.
[00:14:53] Because Colonel Pog comes up with the best plan every time.
[00:14:58] Master your job.
[00:14:59] Lieutenant General Walter Kruger, discipline and the leadership of small units are the things
[00:15:05] which require constant emphasis.
[00:15:08] The enlisted man or officer who does not follow instructions and orders implicitly during
[00:15:12] training or prior to reaching combat areas and who cannot do everything every member of
[00:15:19] his unit might have to do is not properly qualified.
[00:15:21] The squad leader must know exactly what each member of his squad should do in each type
[00:15:25] of operation.
[00:15:26] The platoon leaders should have the same knowledge concerning his squad's and the company
[00:15:30] commander of his platoon.
[00:15:31] Officers must not start worrying about the big picture until they have mastered all the details
[00:15:37] of the little one.
[00:15:39] It's an interesting one.
[00:15:41] I can tell you right now that it would be impossible to know everything that this sniper
[00:15:47] knows it would be possible to know everything that the radio man knows it would be impossible
[00:15:50] to know everything that the point man knows it would be impossible to know everything
[00:15:53] that the breach or knows.
[00:15:55] Do you need to understand them?
[00:15:57] Yes.
[00:15:58] Should you be able to set up that breaching charge and clock it off if you have to absolutely
[00:16:02] should you be able to pick up that radio and make comms if you have to where I take my
[00:16:07] take the communicate.
[00:16:08] It may take the radio man for seconds to do it.
[00:16:10] It might take you three minutes.
[00:16:12] Should you be able to not do it?
[00:16:14] Yes.
[00:16:17] At some point if you're worrying about the details of the little picture, you might be doing
[00:16:23] a disservice by thinking too much about the little picture and not enough about the big
[00:16:28] picture.
[00:16:29] So I think officers should start thinking about the big picture from day one and understanding
[00:16:36] how things fit together.
[00:16:37] Now you can't get lost in that but you got to start thinking about it early.
[00:16:42] Otherwise your habit is just worrying about the little things.
[00:16:45] Your focus becomes looking down and in and set up an out.
[00:16:50] So little.
[00:16:52] That one's too strong for me.
[00:16:54] Too strong for me.
[00:16:55] And I talked about that in leadership strategy and tactics.
[00:16:58] You got to know what to do but.
[00:17:01] There's like a very discreet place in the military where you go from being tactical.
[00:17:08] They call it operation but where you start being a strategic in the Marine Corps it's
[00:17:11] got being a company great officer which is like a junior officer for brand new lieutenant
[00:17:15] to a field great officer.
[00:17:17] And all of a sudden there's this magical moment that when you get promoted from in the
[00:17:21] Marine Corps it's captain to major and a fits in the Navy from Lieutenant to Lieutenant
[00:17:24] Commander.
[00:17:25] Well all of a sudden overnight you are now a field great officer and you're supposed to
[00:17:28] think strategically.
[00:17:29] In this transition point actually is a big source of friction for a lot of folks and the
[00:17:33] people that struggle the most going from company to field great are the ones who have never
[00:17:37] thought about the big picture before.
[00:17:40] And it's not to say that as a second lieutenant that I've been in the Marine Corps for six
[00:17:42] months I need to walk into the CO's office and start talking strategy.
[00:17:47] But you have to start thinking very early on about the impacts of what you do to the big
[00:17:50] picture and assume you can make the connection the easier that transition is.
[00:17:54] And the longer you hold on it because it's just kind of like this cool bravado of like
[00:17:59] I'm a tactician and it sounds really cool and I just want to fly the airplane and I don't
[00:18:03] only care about the big picture.
[00:18:04] Well when the time comes you get promoted and you probably will it was really clear
[00:18:09] the ones who never really thought about what they were doing and how that fit into the
[00:18:12] larger world when you made that promotion that obviously actually became highly incompetent
[00:18:18] at being a field great officer because that's when you were starting and you were being
[00:18:21] out maneuvered by guys who had been doing it since they were brand new officers.
[00:18:25] You know what's really interesting about that is there are some people that have a
[00:18:30] personality and or skill set that is more suited to be a tactical officer and there's
[00:18:37] some people that have a personality and skill set that is more suited to be a field
[00:18:43] great officer or a strategic thinker that's and I see this in companies too.
[00:18:48] I work with companies where the CEO that got that company from whatever position you know
[00:18:56] got them to go public or got them perched or poised to go public as soon as they're
[00:19:02] going public that guy's out there or maybe even before they go public because this guy
[00:19:06] he's good at making the exact dynamic but he's not polished he's not clean he can't
[00:19:10] brief up the chain of command well he doesn't articulate himself at the next level because
[00:19:15] some people can flow from talking to a platoon like the snowpapers was going on like you're
[00:19:21] you can be in that mode and you can walk turnaround and talk to give the general a brief on
[00:19:25] what the impact on the cultural moment or the civilian populist and all those things.
[00:19:31] Some people can do both some people do one some people do the other and it's very interesting.
[00:19:37] It's very interesting because you might not make it to field great officer even though
[00:19:44] you might be you might be good at it but you just don't have the you just don't have it.
[00:19:53] So think about that when you're working with you know when you got people
[00:19:58] subordinates that you're working with you might have somebody that's not maybe the best
[00:20:02] tactical leader.
[00:20:05] Are they can they do the job? You know what I mean look they might not be able to do they might not be
[00:20:10] the best at it but maybe they can get through that job and they can do a good job as the
[00:20:17] at the next level up and some people they might be incredible that get after it in the field
[00:20:25] and you can't let them brief the boss because they're going to mess it up. So the good thing is
[00:20:34] if you're if you're one of these humans out there if you're one of these potential leaders
[00:20:38] think about where you are and think about modulating your personality depending I can promise you
[00:20:46] if you watched me debrief a seal platoon and then you watched me brief the secretary of the navy
[00:20:55] those two guys like the venn diagram overlap was pretty small.
[00:21:01] If you were just to take the words that I said just a man you scrapped or whatever trianscript of what I said
[00:21:06] the core things that I said the I wasn't saying anything different I wasn't saying I wasn't
[00:21:12] giving I wasn't lying to the big boss and I wasn't lying to the troops but the the method of
[00:21:18] delivery was different because I was talking to a different audience who understands things differently.
[00:21:26] Good thing to think about you. A couple of these here trial by fire
[00:21:34] there's there's incredible stories inside these books about what men do and they're definitely
[00:21:44] worth look this is another one from we read one from this last time this is from the
[00:21:49] the battle of the at two island which is those allusion islands up in Alaska fight in the Japanese
[00:21:56] this is a citation. The company led by Captain Thomas Biodonol was thrown into confusion by
[00:22:03] the strafing of hostile airplanes while it was forming to attack under heavy enemy ground small
[00:22:08] arms fire seeing the immediate need captain O'Donnell move from his squad from squad to squad
[00:22:13] restoring order and then led his men to the assault during which he received a severe wound in the
[00:22:18] neck and shoulder and was evacuated three days later upon hearing that his company was again
[00:22:22] scheduled to make an attack he insisted upon returning to the fight although we can suffer
[00:22:27] severe pain from his wounds he led his company in attacks on the enemy until five days later when
[00:22:32] he was mortally wounded while moving about into advanced positions encouraging his men
[00:22:42] one of the one of the one of the lessons that I taught specifically I taught it's a little
[00:22:48] bunch of people but the first time I remember teaching if someone was to was to Seth Stone
[00:22:53] the Delta Patoon commander who you know when you're doing immediate action drills
[00:22:57] there's there's standard operating procedures and you follow you follow the standard operating
[00:23:02] procedures and he would you know he would follow what the rules were and that if that meant
[00:23:09] that he was gonna his next position that he was supposed to go to according to the standard
[00:23:15] operating procedures was behind a berm where he couldn't see anything that's where he was going
[00:23:19] and you know I just said hey man why are you going there you know uh because this is where
[00:23:23] we're supposed to go I said can you see anything no can you make a call no can you can you
[00:23:29] lead your men no okay move move around go see what you got to see you can move around you
[00:23:35] you don't you don't you can't break the SOPs there's a difference right you can't break the SOPs
[00:23:41] but you don't have to follow them perfectly so there's a big difference breaking the SOPs
[00:23:46] means you get out of your lane and now you can get shot by friendly fire not following the SOPs
[00:23:50] means you're staying within the confines of the rules but you're still moving around and telling
[00:23:54] people what to do and you can imagine this is a perfect example of what this whole thing started
[00:23:58] off with which is look this guy in order to get his troops to go he had to personally get out
[00:24:04] there and and you know why would you risk your life to him to in that's what it says encourages
[00:24:10] men why would you risk your life to encourage your men you know why because if you don't do that
[00:24:13] your men are going anywhere that's the breaking the inertia you talk about at the beginning
[00:24:17] exactly you don't do that as a leader you're going to sit there anger you're going to you're going to
[00:24:20] eventually you're going to get rolled you're all going to die in that position you cannot stay there
[00:24:24] but the path of the least resistance that human nature is I like this box hole yeah
[00:24:27] it's going to hang out down here this is good for me and he's like no we can't stay here
[00:24:32] and leadership is the only thing that gets people to see that
[00:24:37] that that is that those are the times when you have to lead from the front
[00:24:40] you got to make things happen
[00:24:43] doubling in brass and I have no idea I don't know if there's some weird
[00:24:47] 1940s idiom that I don't know about but this title is sections doubling in brass
[00:24:54] citation 37th division new Georgia while private Blair F. hurts was performing his duties
[00:25:01] with the maintenance section in the vicinity of the unit ration dump they were attacked by
[00:25:06] japs who had surrounded them he grabbed a bar and advanced on a jap machine gun that was
[00:25:11] delivering intense accurate and extremely effective fire into the dump private hurts
[00:25:16] was able to silence this machine gun and then continue to aid aggressively in the defense
[00:25:20] of the position until reinforcements arrived just getting after it just in the rear
[00:25:25] getting after it when the citation starts with the private you know you know this is going to be
[00:25:30] a good one you know he got some yeah you know what's too bad is you know in the navy you have
[00:25:36] rates where you can tell what the guy's job was or this guy's just a private but you know his
[00:25:40] job was probably you know well he says mate his duties with the maintenance section so this guy was
[00:25:46] changing oils and vehicles or something and then all of a sudden he's grabbing a bar and just
[00:25:51] getting some here we go dichotomy of leadership oh no sorry this section we call that it's
[00:25:58] called something else called be brave intelligently this is a weird one to read lieutenant Colonel
[00:26:06] Ariel Bryan cavalry observer with the fifth army and Italy a prisoner of war a German light
[00:26:12] machine gunner asked an interrogator whether Americans took stimulants to make them foolishly brave
[00:26:20] when asked to explain what he meant he stated that he and an assistant gunner were in position
[00:26:25] with a good field of fire one afternoon when a group of American soldiers was observed approaching
[00:26:31] he fired several short bursts and began preparation to displace to the rear when he saw the
[00:26:38] American soldiers rise to full height and start charging toward his position over a hundred yards away
[00:26:45] he reloaded his gun and opened fire killing 11 men he then withdrew because he was sure the
[00:26:51] charge was made to conceal an development but none was made unit commander has found it necessary
[00:26:59] to direct their men to make full use of concealment and covered approach continued emphasis on the
[00:27:04] necessity for dispersion and the use of covering concealment is essential so this is what we
[00:27:10] don't want to have happen we don't want people to be so brave that you charge over an open area
[00:27:15] a machine gun nest and the comment here says in the interest of efficiency bravery must be
[00:27:23] supplemented by brain work dead heroes are of little further used to their units aggressive
[00:27:30] fighting men trained to apply the most efficient technique to combat problems willing to accept
[00:27:35] any necessary risks and conscientiously avoiding unnecessary risks are the backbone of the army
[00:27:45] got to be brave but you got to be smart there's the dichotomy who's the original
[00:27:50] original statement on that was brave but not full hearting brave but not full hearted
[00:27:54] combat in towns as major campaigns develop in western europe combat in towns assumes increasing
[00:28:03] importance cities towns and villages control the established road nets which must be open for the
[00:28:07] movement of guns heavy equipment it supplies necessary to support the advance of infantry
[00:28:12] combat in towns will often be the key not only to our successful advance but to successful defensive
[00:28:19] actions let's talk about now in 1944 attack of towns captain w heherson heherson parachute
[00:28:29] retreat Italy the theory of attack of a small town or villages to work groups around the
[00:28:35] flanks cut the retreat and moving with patrols in this hilly country however we have found that
[00:28:40] where there is any high ground behind the town which dominates both the town and the line of
[00:28:45] retreat the best way is to work the entire force around the town undercover sees the high ground
[00:28:51] in the rear and firmly establish ourselves with 60 millimeter mortars on that dominating high ground
[00:28:56] we take enough food and ammunition for to last us 24 hours and the Germans usually pull out during
[00:29:01] this time from our position we can prevent reinforcement and inflict heavy losses on them during
[00:29:06] there withdrawal so we're flanking people and we're taking high ground
[00:29:09] I didn't think of anything new I didn't think of anything new
[00:29:22] Lieutenant Colonel LG Freeman parachute infantry battalion commander in Italy
[00:29:28] we learned at Altavia to avoid the direct attack of towns it's too costly we now work around
[00:29:36] to the rear with a large force and seize the dominating ground in the rear we did this at Calo
[00:29:41] Machia for Nellie and several other places the names of which I forgot I like when you're just
[00:29:47] forgetting major battles that you've had to work every time get yourself within 60 millimeter
[00:29:52] mortar range of the town on dominating terrain in or near it and the Germans won't stay in it
[00:29:58] and then it says this here's the comment I like these comments the fact that the Germans have been
[00:30:04] known to withdraw without a fight from towns in the rear of which we hold dominating terrain
[00:30:09] does not necessarily mean that such will invariably be the rule however this possibility plus the
[00:30:16] fact the Caesar such high ground will greatly facilitate any subsequent attack on the town
[00:30:21] proper suggest that commanders should give serious consideration of these tactics where the terrain
[00:30:26] permits it also should be remembered that if such high ground is held by the enemy or attack
[00:30:31] on the town proper will invariably be costly and the town itself untenable that's how important
[00:30:38] high ground is. In planning the attack of the town proper the following considerations should
[00:30:44] be born in mind one reduced observation and limited fields of fire in place of heavier stress on
[00:30:53] close combat so you are going to get some to controlling of attacking troops will be difficult
[00:31:00] and much depends on individual initiative and aggressiveness of small unit leaders so there you
[00:31:07] are we we we we open up talking about how you better follow all these orders and now we're on page eight
[00:31:15] and we're talking about hey you know what it depends on the initiative of initiative and aggressiveness
[00:31:22] of small unit leaders making things happen where possible town should be bypassed isolated
[00:31:29] and attacked from the flanks or the rear why are we even attacking this position if we don't have to
[00:31:34] roll around it imagine if you made that part of your everyday sort of scheme maneuver
[00:31:40] I can beat my head against this wall or I can walk around it it seems like a good idea
[00:31:51] at least it seems like a good idea to me I don't know echoes over their shaking I said like
[00:31:54] I know a lot of times when you say every you know you use those what he call those words that are
[00:31:59] real like real permanent yeah like and do that in every thing you know every time you say that I think
[00:32:06] it's triggered I do I took some I took some heat off of by saying it seems like yeah that would be a
[00:32:12] good thing to do in part of your everyday plan yeah then that's what kind of triggered me so to think like
[00:32:18] of all the things that it probably or maybe wouldn't work yeah I don't know would you treat your
[00:32:24] workouts like that let me sidestep this workout maybe flank it you're on dangerous ground right now
[00:32:34] yes there's going to you're potentially right about that I'm just saying usually when it
[00:32:39] comes to work out I'm going to smash the workout it's based it you know I'm going to go ahead
[00:32:43] on full frontal assault yes sir well I thought would think so anyway unless that make us it depends on
[00:32:48] what you mean by flank like I guess you could flank your initial feelings about the income and
[00:32:54] workout if you don't feel like doing it you know you could maybe maneuver that way maybe but
[00:33:00] maybe maybe not I don't know maybe just direct assault workout smash it get it done I like it
[00:33:06] there are times there are times so maybe not everything in life you know maybe not everything
[00:33:12] yeah but maybe if you're dealing with other people it's a good call yeah that could be the case
[00:33:19] this section here start talking about like how you actually clear towns it goes through
[00:33:24] and then it gets to a point where it starts just telling the comments about the story so I'm not
[00:33:29] going to dump into the story you're not going to go deep into the story here but just some of the
[00:33:33] comments here about the defense of a town the defense of a town must be prepared to meet the
[00:33:37] methods of attack which may be employed by the enemy since this must include the possibility of
[00:33:42] flanking attacks and encirclement it follows that an all-around defense must be the rule the following
[00:33:48] points not covered in the experience quoted above which is the one that I didn't read which
[00:33:52] why you should read these things yourself should be born in mind in planning the defense of a town
[00:33:58] one avoid if possible placing principal centers of resistance close to landmarks or at the edge of
[00:34:04] a town where the enemy adjustment of artillery or mortar fire will be facilitated positions either
[00:34:10] outside or within the town should be chosen and I read this whole section to read this and it's
[00:34:19] something that we talked about the other day on EF online and I don't know if you were if you
[00:34:22] were we on the call and I talked about don't give away your position yes yeah totally I went into a whole
[00:34:26] whole explanation of not giving away your position and it's weird it's weird thing to talk about
[00:34:35] because it seems real sneaky right it seems real like oh it seems real sneaky especially when people
[00:34:42] love so much to talk about like being transparent but here's the deal if you have an idea Dave
[00:34:50] and I have my own idea if I just put my stake in the ground and say my idea is this I'm giving away
[00:34:58] my position now if we were going to go a tack of an enemy outpost I would do everything I possibly
[00:35:04] could to avoid giving away my position because once I give away my position it will now you know
[00:35:09] to where to attack me on so what I would rather do is listen to what you have to say here let let me
[00:35:17] understand what your position is because then it allows me to maneuver and change my position
[00:35:25] and also if you're on offensive person and your ego is out of control as soon as you see my
[00:35:31] position guess what you're going to do attack it so I gave you my position now you're going to
[00:35:35] attack it now what do I do then dig in now what do we have a standoff we have extra casualties we
[00:35:41] don't need so why am I giving away my position when I'm having a conversation and this is it's one
[00:35:47] of those things it sounds so manipulative right but then I took a little bit further on the F online
[00:35:55] I said this is the facts the reason I don't give away my position is because I don't actually have
[00:36:03] one I'm not rolling in there thinking that I know everything I'm thinking I may have some ideas that
[00:36:11] could you might be able to calculate an estimate approximate where I am but I'm not going to go in
[00:36:16] there and say Dave I believe this because not not just because I want to hide it from you that's not why
[00:36:24] it's because I actually question my own beliefs I actually am not looking at you thinking I know the
[00:36:32] best thing to do I've got some ideas but you can't lock down my position because I'm not going to
[00:36:38] stay there I'm not digging in being transparent this authenticity doesn't have to be in
[00:36:46] opposition to what we just described either being transparent could be hey I'm going to I'm going to
[00:36:52] have a conversation to tell you a whole bunch of things that I'm thinking about that are things
[00:36:56] for you to consider as well for me maybe thinking what I don't want to do is sit here and go
[00:37:00] hey you've mentioned three things that are really feel like I want to give you feedback on but I don't
[00:37:04] want to tell you those things for whatever reason being transparent is not the same is digging your
[00:37:10] heels in those the authenticity of that there's this you would know this echo there's this social
[00:37:17] media thing we're like somebody says some statement it's like a meme and then it says prove me wrong
[00:37:22] it'll say like Martians colonized the moon proved me wrong or louder with crowd or situation
[00:37:28] whatever I don't I I should know more about it no you probably know enough but there's this little
[00:37:33] you know what kind of underneath that is this idea like you're not going to change my mind
[00:37:39] I know that you're not going to change my mind I'm being fully transparent here this idea of
[00:37:43] transparency doesn't have to be the opposite of what you just described you can be fully transparent
[00:37:50] and if I actually my relationship is strong enough with you you know what you're going to do when
[00:37:53] I'm being transparent you're going to listen to me and then you're going to come back with some
[00:37:56] things that's a good point and then actually together what will happen is we'll come up with the
[00:38:00] right plan and then we'll go execute it and it'll be awesome yeah the idea of not giving away
[00:38:04] your position you don't give it away not because you did not because you're hiding it it's because
[00:38:08] you're truly don't know you don't lock yourself into it so I'm not walking in the conversations
[00:38:13] I know what to do not doing that and if you if you're in a leadership role if you're in an actual
[00:38:20] leadership role how much do you think your people really want to engage with you if you
[00:38:24] announce your position out of the gate what's the chances of them giving you great feedback
[00:38:30] you can transparent yeah yeah how does that encourage transparency from the troops answer
[00:38:36] it doesn't well and if it does hey Dave that sounds a great idea I fully support your idea
[00:38:40] you're so smart yeah which is the last thing you want is a leader to be told how smart you are
[00:38:44] by your support it's you want to be told hey I don't agree with you a great tell me why
[00:38:49] where practical forms salience by organizing outlying buildings to cover perimeter
[00:39:01] of town with flanking and an unfulfilled fire I had to look up the word salience
[00:39:07] I said I didn't know what it meant it's like a little projection that's sticking out
[00:39:12] of the battle line so you in order to get a little better cover you can you can take an outline
[00:39:17] building and you can set up a kind of a a fort there good now a salient yeah form salience
[00:39:25] because there's a word salient right yeah it means like significant or what does that mean
[00:39:29] I think it's like a clear point yeah which is the the other it's the same thing right a clear point
[00:39:35] well here I am making this it's a couple of projections a point something sticks out
[00:39:39] that was a salient point yeah meaning oh yeah I rose a good point I understand what you said
[00:39:44] oh we built a salient out there what's a little point where we've got the solid coverage
[00:39:51] kind of like monolithic kind of same deal yeah I guess kind of kind of the same deal like
[00:39:57] there's a monolith which is the noun version of monolithic kind of kind of thing
[00:40:04] yes there are all kinds of words that are based on other words hey I'm just trying to understand
[00:40:08] real deal yeah everyone's while echo says something and then once he says he writes down a little
[00:40:14] note and that means he's gonna go back and edit himself out I don't know if that made the list I think
[00:40:19] he's gonna hold it I think he's going strong no hey made that it'll probably help some people
[00:40:23] as far as salient and salient goes yeah and and also help people realize that there are multiple
[00:40:30] versions of the same words in the world yes it's sure oh my jerk that too is sure in addition to a
[00:40:39] central reserve within the town provide if possible for a concealed mobile reserve preferably
[00:40:45] strong and armor to be held outside the town to counter enemy flanking maneuver and once again what
[00:40:51] is the root of that right there don't give away your position the root of it is hey hide this element
[00:40:56] which is smart keep it mobile wherever adjacent terrain features dominate the town they should
[00:41:04] be secured obviously this use of high ground maybe key to successful defense that's funny they
[00:41:11] they say dominant terrain and then they just call it high ground within the town the construction
[00:41:16] of street obstacles or barricades to impede enemy movements and the organization of groups
[00:41:20] of buildings into strong points should be carried out as extensively as time available will permit
[00:41:28] strength in your defenses in delaying actions the defensive use of towns will prevent the
[00:41:32] attacker from determining the strength of the opposing of the forces opposing him it is not
[00:41:37] normally advisable to organize a town as an isolated strong point except under terrain conditions
[00:41:43] which prevent the enemy bypassing it so don't stick a town out there on its own don't stick
[00:41:49] anyone out there on their own unless the terrain allows it so then there's a um i didn't cover one of
[00:42:00] these one of these sections but this one when i started reading it and as i read through it i
[00:42:06] said myself this is such a great example of simplicity and the way this this battalion attack
[00:42:14] happens and then the way it gets debriefed is all very interesting so i'm going to burn through this real
[00:42:19] quick mission is a battalion attack in Italy mission lieutenant colonel Earl Taylor infantry battalion
[00:42:25] commander in Italy on october on eleven october my battalion was ordered to make a night march
[00:42:30] passed through the second battalion which was about three miles east of the Italian town of Guadilla
[00:42:37] north of the color river and seize the high ground in the vicinity of Guadilla we were then
[00:42:43] to continue the advance contact as we approach Guadilla our leading company made contact with the
[00:42:50] enemy at a and there's a sketch that they go through this it developed with one platoon was
[00:42:55] stopped by heavy machine gun and direct 88 millimeter fire from point E f and D and was unable to advance
[00:43:02] i immediately move to the high ground so basically they get into a big gunfight
[00:43:07] and they can't they can't move forward and here's here's what i like i immediately move to the
[00:43:12] high ground 200 yards north where i could observe the enemy position so right now we have observed
[00:43:20] happening getting on the high ground love that observe what's he doing why's he observing well
[00:43:25] because he's got to figure out what to do now he gets up in this observation position
[00:43:31] and he says the enemy had all of the high ground to the front and i could see it would be impossible
[00:43:36] to advance frontally so what does that mean now he's orienting himself to the situation
[00:43:43] oh the enemy's got all this high ground up here i can't advance friendly so then was it
[00:43:47] you do so i decided to make a double involvement sending company i over the hill to the right
[00:43:55] and company k on a wide left development contact was to be maintained visually so there's the action
[00:44:02] he's at that that's it's actually happening so he goes through the loop in like four sentences which is totally
[00:44:07] legit
[00:44:10] base of fire five tanks were available for the attack realizing that the tanks could not move
[00:44:14] down the road to guardia which is the only tank approach due to the streams and high mountains
[00:44:18] and because the enemy had eighty-eighths and armored cars at f i decided to do in place the tanks
[00:44:22] along with my eight heavy machine guns and six eighty-one millimeter motors as shown in the sketch
[00:44:27] results the attack was successful by order the tanks and other supporting weapons opened fire five
[00:44:35] minutes before company l started its defense that is called cover move we got tanks and and supporting
[00:44:40] weapons firing and then company l starts their move after five minutes 15 prisoners were captured
[00:44:46] 25 enemy killed our casualties were approximately ten killed and fifteen wounded
[00:44:50] which when you think about the assault on a you know in an urban environment you're going to take
[00:44:57] some casualties and those are certainly some casualties but those are not as bad as you might
[00:45:04] imagine going into a city when you consider the fact that if you don't know anything about urban combat
[00:45:09] one enemy with a machine gun can kill dozens and dozens of troops
[00:45:16] the enemy strength as determined from prisoners was two rifle companies each reinforced
[00:45:25] supported by tanks armored cars eighty-eighths along the road these prisoners stated that their
[00:45:29] force was so completely disorganized and demoralized by our volume of fire that and scheme of attack
[00:45:35] that was impossible for them to make a counterattack and regain their positions planning it
[00:45:40] took about two hours to make plans for this attack which was very carefully studied planned and coordinated
[00:45:45] it's funny it's sometimes the US military spends months making plans for an attack and and
[00:45:53] he said this took two hours but it was carefully studied planned and coordinated that's what
[00:45:57] he needed was a solid two hours it effectively you utilize the train features every weapon
[00:46:02] available to the battalion was used in such an attack maps must be pure range with critical points
[00:46:06] in phase lines once the attack has started the basic plan cannot be changed it must succeed that's
[00:46:13] an interesting statement and I think the word that I underland was basic you're not your head Dave like
[00:46:21] yeah my immediate reaction is must not be changed I get a like a sense of like well that's
[00:46:27] that but yeah you're right the basic plan of basic doesn't say we can't change so
[00:46:31] rather than sort of get all excited that he says he can't change the thing is to he's right
[00:46:36] especially at night and when you look at this whole situation you actually want to limit
[00:46:41] the amount of replanting a recoil you want to limit a lot of things now not the individual
[00:46:47] actions of the teams of maneuvering and things like that and let them make the adjustments but
[00:46:51] you don't want one element to go you know what let's cancel the development and just do something
[00:46:56] different and abandon your portion of the plane you actually can't do that so you actually need to
[00:47:00] keep the basic plan that that clarity actually made a lot of stuff yeah one word yeah that one
[00:47:05] word makes a big difference when you start thinking about what they're doing you've got what is
[00:47:09] an eight heavy machine guns since those guys are doing a fire a fire mission on this town for
[00:47:16] five minutes before you enter the town that's coordination you can't start thinking well you know
[00:47:21] I think I'm gonna go earlier whatever it is your the basic plan you got to stick with that basic plan
[00:47:26] then I this is something that I lived by if I if it was possible to stick with the basic plan
[00:47:35] I was sticking with the basic plan like it would have to be something really now we would have a
[00:47:40] contingency plan hey but if I could avoid using the contingency plan I would stick with the basic plan
[00:47:47] that we we we we rehearsed and we would rehearse the contingency too but yeah people expect what they're
[00:47:52] going to be doing we had the exact same philosophy we we had contingency plans but the part of that
[00:47:58] that made that possible is our plans were usually really fluid yeah some key limits you had some
[00:48:06] limiting decisions inside there but our plans weren't hyper detailed and super down to the
[00:48:11] so you could stick to the basic plan we used to have just a joke stick to the plan that was what we
[00:48:15] always said like what what did he do just stick to the plan that didn't mean you don't think you don't
[00:48:19] just make changes but the idea that what we planned and how we coordinated stick to that and then
[00:48:25] make smart decisions along the way to reinforce that as opposed to you get halfway there and then
[00:48:30] hey no we should do we should come up with a new plan like there's no time to come up with a new plan
[00:48:34] once you cross the line of departure you kind of need to stick to the plan the basic plan which
[00:48:38] also drove our plans to be basic we had very basic big picture plans yeah simple and flexible
[00:48:45] if you know if the three of us were going to go and take down a building and we say okay here's the
[00:48:52] way it's going to go once we get to the front door echo you're going to open the door
[00:48:58] Dave you're going to go left I'm going to go right and then echo you're going to go left and we
[00:49:03] okay and we rehearse that 10 times I promise you that as we approach that building there's going to be
[00:49:10] a civilian in the front yard that echoes going to have to deal with and all of a sudden that
[00:49:13] whole plan is out the window so you can't go to that level of detail and you definitely need to have
[00:49:19] flexibility there but the basic plan of hey we're going to approach the building totally that's not
[00:49:23] going to change because we know where the fire sport is it's set or a set or a set or
[00:49:28] estimating the situation in planning should be emphasized in training comment and this was I found
[00:49:33] this interesting too this account is a good example of fire movement on the batailing the
[00:49:40] I have no idea I guess I guess I got it from Roger Hayden why why I use the term cover move instead
[00:49:45] of fire movement because of the same thing but I same thing cover move and fire movement are the
[00:49:52] same thing this account at least as far as I know is it am I am I missing something I don't think so
[00:49:57] we use the term fire maneuver yeah that was the one element moves one element covers and I think
[00:50:03] it's anonymous yeah yeah however it should be pointed out that a double development is a rather
[00:50:09] ambitious scheme of maneuver for a single battalion and should be used with caution and I love
[00:50:13] seeing that because what you're talking about echo Charles is you're talking about a double
[00:50:21] development you're basically surrounding a target which means you got good guys on the flanks
[00:50:30] of bad guys and if you start shooting at the bad guys in the middle you can shoot yourself
[00:50:34] and it's really problematic the the thing about this and there would be occasional
[00:50:40] seal platoons it would go yeah we're gonna just surround the target it works when nothing goes wrong
[00:50:47] it works when the enemy doesn't start shooting it works if you have on the positive side it
[00:50:52] works if you have a terrain feature that prevents friendly fire which is possible you can have a
[00:50:57] you know a ravine that allows you to be in a certain position but when you when you do these
[00:51:05] battalion sized operations you're actually getting out of the you should be moving outside the
[00:51:10] range of your own weapons which is what the goal is right you know we're really far away and
[00:51:16] and as long as we are shooting our weapons at the enemy there's a very small chance that
[00:51:21] our weapons are gonna hit our friendly forces so be very careful about double development
[00:51:30] and same thing with going to an enemy's rear like if you're gonna do that
[00:51:34] well then you've got to pay attention to how that's gonna work out it is a lot harder than it looks
[00:51:40] no mention is made of the Constitution of a reserve force such a reserve must be retained under
[00:51:46] the control of the commander to enable to counter unforeseen enemy reaction as the attack progresses
[00:51:52] troops committed to a plan of action cannot be considered as available for this purpose
[00:51:57] the division of the battalion into a into approximately three equal attack forces is open
[00:52:04] a criticism but it worked in this case a schema maneuver should include a determination of the
[00:52:12] direction of the main effort and the provonorance of the force should be available to support this effort
[00:52:17] here's an interesting story so one of the great tactical lessons learned of my life which I learned
[00:52:24] and training when you so we would set up you know to do target assaults typical does any army manual
[00:52:32] any any marine corps manual of how you do a target assault you know you set up a base element
[00:52:36] and a maneuver element so the base element is gonna engage the target it gets in position
[00:52:41] and it shoots at the target once it's shot at the target for a certain amount of time
[00:52:45] the assault element then gets up and maneuvers towards the target when they get to a certain
[00:52:50] point the people shooting at the target shift fire off the target but they keep shooting and eventually
[00:52:55] they move the assault team moves through the target and I was watching a young junior officer
[00:53:04] I was in training at Celtine 1 and he he said okay what we're gonna do is for our base element
[00:53:09] that's gonna do all the shooting at the target area what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our
[00:53:13] machine gunners from the other from the assault element who asked to move we're gonna move
[00:53:20] the machine gunners into the base element we're gonna take some of the riflemen and put them in
[00:53:22] the assault elements so they can move easier and they can get through the target and I said
[00:53:26] that's thinking myself that's pretty smart smart guy is gonna get a really strong base element
[00:53:31] Vietnam vet said what are you doing he said well you know you know master she if I'm gonna
[00:53:38] go ahead and put heavy or stronger base over here and the machine gun element and put all my
[00:53:42] machine guns over in the base element and I'm like I can already tell I'm glad I didn't
[00:53:46] come up with this plan but why is that you know he says well because I want to have more
[00:53:53] machine guns I want to have more firepower in my base element and then the the mask
[00:53:58] shooting one question said what happens if the assault element gets compromised on the way in
[00:54:07] end of discussion because now we don't have any machine guns and and by the way what should
[00:54:12] happen is if we have machine guns in the assault element the assault element just became
[00:54:16] the base element that's what just happened so and and the thing that the other lesson that I
[00:54:22] learned from that was that what you really get to do the other benefit which I actually would
[00:54:28] say isn't even bigger benefit is we have unit integrity which I love unit integrity that squad
[00:54:34] or that platoon's always working together the machine gunners are there they can break off they
[00:54:38] can assault things they can do all kinds of things where when you pull those machine gunners out
[00:54:42] they're not they're way less capable so apply that to your business to your team how do we keep
[00:54:52] the teams together how do we keep the teams together how do we keep them both how do we keep
[00:54:59] them most capable that's what we want to do setting up a little specialty moments is a risky call
[00:55:09] factors contributing to the success in this attack were prompt estimate of the situation by the
[00:55:15] commander including a study of the terrain based on personal reconnaissance development of a
[00:55:20] definite plan of maneuver based on the seizure of key terrain and outflanking enemy position
[00:55:25] detail planning of specific orders utilization of maximum firepower where available maintenance
[00:55:31] of control over the elements little section here on fighting and wooded terrain lieutenant
[00:55:37] Colonel F.L. Walker infantry battalion commander Italy the area in which my battalion operated
[00:55:43] was covered in thick scrub trees and fruit orchards interspersed with frequent farmhouses many
[00:55:49] stone walls six to eight feet in height and numerous sunken roads field of fire was greatly restricted
[00:55:55] average observation was only 52 hundred yards enemy delaying groups with machine guns were widely
[00:56:01] scattered and impossible locate until arrival within a hundred yards or less it was found necessary
[00:56:08] to place heavy weapons out in the front line or very close up to avoid hitting our troops
[00:56:13] after encountering hostile fire was found very effective to spray the entire woods ahead with a
[00:56:19] massive concentration of mortar machine gunfire for about one minute followed by a rapid advance of
[00:56:23] rifle platoons under a salt fire to cover all the trees and house windows where snipers might
[00:56:29] be hiding in each case Germans pulled out rapidly leaving weapons and ammunition behind
[00:56:33] although we had been unable to locate them previously however the tendency of troops
[00:56:39] is to wait for definitely located targets before they will open fire which results in allowing
[00:56:45] very small groups of enemy to shift position frequently and keep up a demoralizing rate of
[00:56:51] machine gunfire to cause a great delay the continuous rapid fire delivered by our heavy
[00:56:57] machine guns had a particularly demoralizing effect on the Germans. The remarks of this
[00:57:05] battalion commander emphasized the importance of barrage covering fire the fire power of available
[00:57:10] weapons in this instance substitute for our artillery but roge but the principle remains the same
[00:57:16] cover move losses will be minimized by following closely the mass fires of available weapons
[00:57:21] delivered in areas from which enemy fire is expected I think the enemy might be there on
[00:57:28] putting rounds into it and it's an interesting how that one dynamic think about that learn that lesson
[00:57:35] learned of realizing hey what we need to do is lay down heavy fire where every we think there
[00:57:43] might be enemy and push forward as quickly as we can think about that lesson learned think
[00:57:49] about the first time and happens the first time and happens you're like oh where are they where
[00:57:52] are they no one shooting and then someone goes hey put out fire and advance
[00:57:58] guys start laying down fire and they start laying down fire where they think there's enemy
[00:58:03] and then that allows you to get the enemies heads down because they are somewhere out there
[00:58:07] and you get their heads down and now you're maneuvering and when you're maneuvering they're not
[00:58:10] and now you win but can you imagine that that's a little bit off of our instinct right as a human
[00:58:17] if you don't if you don't if you don't get trained that way your instinct is not hey I'm just
[00:58:22] gonna shoot where I think there's bad guys I'm gonna shoot not a little dark corner over there I'm
[00:58:25] gonna shoot not window over there I'm gonna shoot near that stone wall over there you haven't seen one
[00:58:29] enemy but that's where you're shooting and now you have a whole company of soldiers doing that that's
[00:58:34] a lot of firepower going down range and it allows you to move because somewhere in one of those positions
[00:58:38] there was enemy but think about what it took to learn that lesson and how valuable that lesson
[00:58:45] right there is to be able to tell people and it also talks about the importance of speed which is the
[00:58:51] next note regimental commander infantry Sicily I believe that the individual soldier now realizes
[00:58:58] that a relentless steady advance saves casualties and that he is now imbued with the knowledge of the
[00:59:05] importance of speed every man in this regiment is firmly convinced that the speed of our recent
[00:59:10] operations saved us from huge losses down to the lowest private the feeling exists that we would still
[00:59:17] be at can of saudi if we had not pushed the enemy off balance and kept in that way
[00:59:29] you know how often are we sitting there waiting for the perfect plan the perfect whatever
[00:59:34] on what we should be doing is moving right you you want to just bring this down to work and
[00:59:38] now echo Charles since that seems to be your main you know topic for the day yeah cool yes so
[00:59:45] let's look at two options one alright what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go research on the internet
[00:59:50] you know what the max time under load I need to do for this particular workout right time under tension
[00:59:56] you love a mobile right become up with a my periodicity for my periodization my periodization
[01:00:04] for my workouts right all these things that you could spend two hours to research and then writing
[01:00:10] and mapping out or you could go do a bunch of clean and jerks just go yeah there isn't
[01:00:16] advantage to doing clean and jerks look I'm not saying you got to be an idiot no but there are
[01:00:21] some some positive things to just going yes and keeping moving and firing where you think it might
[01:00:28] hey I don't know about the the the the internal bicep hand or whatever the break you'll
[01:00:38] head of the bicep which I know you probably got some little high tuned exercise in short
[01:00:44] hands yeah there you go see you do certain types of curls with the easy part of hit that target right
[01:00:51] whereas you could just say hey let's face it go do some curls right yeah actually you're right
[01:00:56] I actually agree with the hundred percent I agree with that philosophy in working out yeah I mean
[01:01:00] there's a couple of things you want to know otherwise you're just kind of you know moving around
[01:01:04] with with no specific direction which I you know teach their own but yeah I think that actually
[01:01:11] is a very good analogy you know you see sort out what am I trying to do here um get a few basic methods
[01:01:18] on try to you know how to achieve it and this go especially when you start coupling that attitude
[01:01:24] with the fact that we don't want to move in the first place right that inertia we're just trying
[01:01:29] to stay still and now we can we can we can focus on that by just doing a bunch of planning like
[01:01:35] hey I'm just waiting to see where the bad guys are I'm just waiting no freaking lay down fire
[01:01:40] that's that's the way you wake up in the morning you wake up in the morning saying I'm
[01:01:44] going to put down fire that's what I'm doing yeah you're right about that too how you you're
[01:01:51] like oh wait let me try to remember what I was going to do today and be like well I
[01:01:56] should maybe she did because tomorrow I'm going to do this so maybe I shouldn't do this you know
[01:02:00] I shouldn't do it that hard or and you know and you've spent all this time and then it's like well
[01:02:05] shoot if I do the whole workout now shoot dinners like in like 45 minutes so maybe I should
[01:02:12] I don't know what you're just saying depends on when you work out I guess true and you know
[01:02:16] not in your case for sure maybe you're breakfast or whatever but yeah and then you're like oh that's
[01:02:21] 45 minutes that only gives me like 10 minutes to work like or one minute to warm up and maybe
[01:02:26] I mean I might just do this tomorrow that way I could get the whole thing done you see them saying
[01:02:30] then yeah brother all that planning not only did it not a lot of that not matter
[01:02:34] meanwhile weakness is winning in your body mean what weakness is winning man and then there's that
[01:02:39] I do avoid yeah is that I think it was you we talked about I don't know whatever but yeah
[01:02:45] when you let the weakness creep in you give that weakness a precedent you know so the
[01:02:49] the weakness is sort of like oh yeah I kind of approved my my my my presence kind of thing
[01:02:54] I was talking about this on a year phone line the other day I I've been doing this lately in my head
[01:03:01] so and I haven't quite figured out what this means but I know it's been very functional
[01:03:06] when you have like an option of doing a bad thing or just not doing the bad thing that reaction
[01:03:20] of just not doing the bad thing isn't strong enough I've actually been trying to do something good
[01:03:26] okay does that make sense I think let me let me get some example oh there's a donut over there
[01:03:32] you know what I'm not gonna eat the donut that's not strong enough not not only may not
[01:03:38] gonna eat the donut I'm actually gonna go and do 20 burpees yeah and you know it doesn't even
[01:03:45] have to be extreme because guess what you you're working or whatever and just like I just want
[01:03:48] to have a no no no I'm not gonna eat that donut and you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go and
[01:03:53] get my desk cleared off right now yeah kind of see yeah doing something but actually proactive
[01:03:59] to crush to crush that weakness that's wanting to grab it just it's like if you it's like you know
[01:04:10] if I say hey echo echo you know you you want to you want to come by my house and
[01:04:17] and grill up some steaks and let's say you don't really feel like doing it and so you're like well
[01:04:23] you know what I mean I'm gonna pressure you but if you're like negative I'm already doing something
[01:04:27] I'm like okay that case closed right case closed you already want yeah so I'm just saying going a
[01:04:32] little bit harder at the weakness yeah it's a little trend I've been right now yeah and that and that
[01:04:37] works I mean it depends on what you mean by works but that's a good move that's like yeah you know
[01:04:41] like yeah I'm about to like okay I have burpees at the end of this workout I've finished the
[01:04:47] work I work out with hundred burpees we'll say I'll be like man now workout was pretty solid you
[01:04:53] know I don't know about those burpees you know let's we'll do those burpees another time we're
[01:04:57] gonna skip the burpees is what we're gonna do then this comes time to skip the point you're like you
[01:05:01] know what no hundred fifty or two hundred now just for thinking that you know oh yeah you're going
[01:05:07] hard on weakness yes that's a positive that I think you're right I'm gonna start like this
[01:05:11] this ties in for me I'm gonna start laying down fire I'm gonna start being even more proactive
[01:05:16] I start seeing weakness I'm laying down fire I'm putting my buttons of morgue around so bad stuff
[01:05:21] you know what you write down Dave I think we went so far away from whatever I'm not sure I can
[01:05:28] bring us back we're talking about burpees and bicep levels bro you talked about bias before so
[01:05:36] actually it might be a little connection if we think about it first I mean you were talking about
[01:05:40] well you actually weren't talking about bias I had the word bias in my mind when we had a plan
[01:05:45] hey we're gonna go to the building you're gonna go to the the East Airwell you're gonna go to the
[01:05:48] West and hey we that might not happen we might have to do something different we used to brief
[01:05:52] gun on missions these general missions like hey all things being equal I want you to bias to the
[01:05:57] South and if you know we get additional pressure you're gonna be the the element that biases
[01:06:02] to the South now look something may come up where you can't do that and that's fine you may go to
[01:06:05] the North go ahead let me know but our plan is that all things being equal we're gonna bias in this
[01:06:12] direction which allows you to keep my plans like really general yeah that's about this general
[01:06:16] yeah and it's but it's it's not completely like out and nowhere we don't have some idea but
[01:06:22] it's like hey these are the things we're anticipating and all things being equal I want you were
[01:06:27] we were talking about the the inertia thing which is kind of bugged me from the beginning but I
[01:06:34] actually was thinking about as you were saying it is you know he's talking about like the laws
[01:06:39] of physics whereas objects in at rest tend to stay at rest and objects in motion tend to stay
[01:06:45] in motion and the hard part is getting the the staying at rest and getting it to the motion like
[01:06:51] once you get the motion going actually it's not that hard to keep it going it's the friction of
[01:06:56] doing nothing and is that connection you look you said I know you didn't invent it but this idea
[01:07:01] of default aggressive this bias for doing something is the hardest thing to get which is
[01:07:07] the natural bias of doing something and when you made that comment about when I see weakness
[01:07:13] or I feel weakness the natural bias is oh no I'm not going to give into that weakness
[01:07:20] I'm going to do nothing which everyone's like that's the win and you're like no actually
[01:07:23] that's not the win the win is not to do nothing no is it better than anything you don't it yes
[01:07:30] but we're not here to just not eat donuts that's not the game we're playing over here the game
[01:07:34] we're playing is just not to eat the donuts and he started the very first thing is leadership
[01:07:40] versus inertia it's that how hard is it to get the movement to do something but once you have
[01:07:47] that bias that bias to maneuver and that starts not that hard it actually gets easier every
[01:07:56] single time so that's my connection to things you were saying and yeah I'm going to let you guys
[01:08:01] talk about what it is you talk about but that's what I was thinking about is that what that bias really
[01:08:05] means to tie back to the very first thing that I kind of thought about was like what did you talk about
[01:08:09] because I think inertia is movement and inertia is not movement it's just the state that you're in
[01:08:13] inertia could be doing nothing and that's what you're talking about it's breaking out of that
[01:08:17] and the bias to move which is the the most challenging thing yeah I talk about pushing a train
[01:08:24] you know and I was like hey if you're going to push your train the first getting that thing to
[01:08:29] start moving is the hardest part and you start pushing you push you push and it eventually
[01:08:35] starts to move a little bit and then you get to a point if you keep pushing that thing where you can
[01:08:40] actually like grab onto the railing and hang on for a second it's just going to keep going you
[01:08:44] started it when you were talking about blast and rocket ship out of here exactly you can actually
[01:08:48] use 90% of your effort to get that in your need you don't need 90% you can coast the rest of the
[01:08:55] way once you break free of that gravitational force of like literally I'm just going to I'm just
[01:09:01] on the train now yeah now look if you can just jump on a speeding train go for it but most of us most
[01:09:06] people have to actually get that train from a dead stop and move it yeah you've ever seen those guys
[01:09:11] roll up a frying pan like a piece of paper I think I think that's like the the method
[01:09:19] really yeah like you hit it like real hard of that initial button then it like heats up the
[01:09:23] molecule so it becomes more yeah in some mistaken unless I got tricked or something like that
[01:09:29] and it's one big trick but I'm pretty sure that the cause it's always a strong man right
[01:09:34] strongman it's the week and rolling up a frying pan I'll tell you that but it's usually like a
[01:09:40] feet of strength so now I wonder if it's like you're seeming to bring it some sort of molecular
[01:09:46] level which I'm not sure about that was the explanation for real they're like this is the trick
[01:09:52] this is how you do it you know what I do not know if you're right and I do not know if you are wrong
[01:09:57] I'm gonna just leave it hanging and people will let us know and we will get someone with a frying pan
[01:10:02] posting it and telling us hey echo Charles is 100% right or echo Charles
[01:10:09] Bruce Hans the most likely outcome of this is either of those it's bro echo talking about frying
[01:10:17] pans when we're talking about combat that's the most likely out of the concept and everywhere there's
[01:10:22] so much I can do to keep us on topic here echo I'm just saying if you can work with a frying pan
[01:10:26] brats good and rocket ships and whatnot it can work with like every day stuff and I actually think
[01:10:31] echo is the premier example in the world premier example of in the world in the entire world of
[01:10:39] if you know the way bro you see it and all things you're seeing combat in a frying pan
[01:10:43] yeah these these ideas are everywhere but there was uh the well it's far as feet of strength go
[01:10:49] there's the ripping the phone book one yeah right I think there's a little trick there's an
[01:10:52] one you got like unbunch and we're bunching but I think your point is that that initial the initial
[01:10:57] break is the hard part is hard part so that's where you use technique roll roll okay how it
[01:11:04] went was the the curling up of the frying pan how it's explained is you hit it with that first
[01:11:10] force of the rolling action but you just can't like you can't hit one and then re-grip and hit
[01:11:17] another one it's not like that you gotta hit it once and just keep keep going don't let like the
[01:11:21] momentum stop because the molecules are still heated up for that moment it's a more malleable
[01:11:28] whatever that's how it was explained to me we're gonna look at that you're going out on the limb I
[01:11:33] like you you got no problem taking risk I like the way you will next one the herd instinct major
[01:11:38] Robert Wilson observer with the at exhibition they don't name the division and Italy our troops
[01:11:44] echoes taking a note maybe he's concerned that's getting edited oh you're going strong no you're
[01:11:49] all good our troops showed a decided tendency to bunch up under fire this was observed on
[01:11:55] several occasions one prisoner war a German forward observer from 88 millimeter battery
[01:12:00] was interrogated concerning his technique of adjustment it seems he had been told that American
[01:12:04] troops congregated one under fire when he saw American troops advancing he would call for one or two
[01:12:09] rounds in their vicinity and observe the area where they congregated fire was then shifted to that
[01:12:16] area the prisoner stated that he conducted very effective fire in this way in several occasions on
[01:12:20] Italy don't bunch up don't bunch up leaders of strategy and tactics talk about this
[01:12:26] one of my leadership perspective let the leader lead you don't need to jump in there and crowd
[01:12:31] the leader everyone could get no dilatary let me tell you my opinion listen what the malle's has to
[01:12:36] say if you want some suggestions give it to them don't crowd don't bunch up base of fire lieutenant
[01:12:42] Colonel jm fan infantry battalion commander it was found that so long as japs could keep us
[01:12:50] ducking from aimed fire their position remained secure but once the jap was made to keep his head
[01:12:56] down in the Americans could get to his feet in attack there's merely a matter of walking up
[01:13:00] the position in tossing ingrown aids to make this possible require the coordination of fires down
[01:13:06] to an including the riflemen it is important that commanders and leaders realize this otherwise
[01:13:11] troops were remained down when it's not necessary so amazing it's so amazing cover move teamwork
[01:13:21] down to the lowest level yeah and I just said teamwork and guess what the next section's called
[01:13:27] and I did not look at this the next section of teamwork we would have a riflemen point out a pill
[01:13:32] box using tracer ammunition then a 37 millimeter gun would take them under fire with high explosives
[01:13:37] oftentimes a pill box crew to tempt to evacuate to a safer place and the light machine gun would
[01:13:41] mode them down isn't it interesting when we talk about teamwork and we talk about cover move
[01:13:49] the reason that it is such an incredible metaphor is because if you don't cover and move you don't
[01:13:58] win it's as simple as that if you don't have one element that's shooting at the japones
[01:14:04] while the other element is walking up and if you don't do that you lose that's what happens you lose
[01:14:09] if you do that you win if you work together as a team you win here's Lieutenant Colonel TF Boger
[01:14:22] infantry officer Italy one night in the vicinity of avalino the batina established an outpost line
[01:14:29] around the high ground to the northeast city patrols were ordered up several roads leading out of the
[01:14:34] city all company commanders were informed of the dispositions the patrols were now before the
[01:14:39] outposts were posted a few hours later firing was heard at the batina cp which increased in tempo
[01:14:45] and kept up most of the night soon reports were sent that sent in that German patrols were operating
[01:14:52] in front of the outposts I'm sure you all know let's come in next morning it became apparent that
[01:14:57] our own patrols had been fired on as they attempted to return to the outpost line comment the constant
[01:15:04] recurrence of such reports indicates the necessity for closer coordination of patrol activity
[01:15:10] with the outposts of with the outpost system positive steps must be taken to ensure that the roots
[01:15:16] of returning patrols are known to the outposts and that recognition signals are arranged
[01:15:23] blue on blue no one thinks it's gonna happen no one thinks it's gonna happen
[01:15:28] I never never even thought about blue on blue it was like such a it seemed like such a
[01:15:38] I shouldn't say we never thought about it but it seemed like such a foreign idea you think how
[01:15:43] could that ever happen the way I know and everything's just gonna happen to them but that's
[01:15:48] they always know what happens but it always happens to somebody else some other teams
[01:15:54] so it never happens to them I mean even that comment is like the common a current or
[01:16:00] a common debrief that we got on this and whatever you said like how often they heard that same exact
[01:16:04] story
[01:16:10] notes from other arms there's another one about just staying off the skyline right don't give away your
[01:16:15] position I just had to highlight this process section about what it was like when they had
[01:16:22] an entire craft versus when they didn't have it and the title of this section is absence makes the
[01:16:28] heart grow longer and what it was like and and what he says in here is that the
[01:16:35] rarely would the anti aircraft actually hit a German aircraft that was strafing them who rarely
[01:16:40] happened but when the anti aircraft wasn't there the German aircraft would just come down and just hammer
[01:16:47] free ray radio discipline first lieutenant CE plays air corps Sicily flyers coming into the combat
[01:16:58] zone had no conception of radio discipline Dave new pilots use the radio indiscriminately
[01:17:08] men returning from missions use the interplane radio unnecessarily which jammed up the band for
[01:17:14] other planes still on a mission comment failure to observe radio discipline is a major problem for
[01:17:20] both air and ground units in combat each individual believes his case is a special one not bound
[01:17:27] by established rules this tendency must be discouraged by positive action radio discipline is
[01:17:33] established to facilitate essential communications during combat and it's not a peace time play
[01:17:37] thing to be discarded when action is joined and this is this is task unit bruiser we were freaking
[01:17:45] awesome at radio discipline we did not talk on the radio in fact there would be operations where some
[01:17:53] some task units might use two or even three separate radio nets to coordinate and in task unit
[01:18:00] bruiser we would use one and it would be almost completely silent so yeah and and how is this
[01:18:08] transite in the regular life it's talking all the time it's not having discipline what the hell you say
[01:18:15] just feeling like you got to throw in your two cents all the time yeah yes for those of you that aren't
[01:18:22] seeing this I'm looking right right at my friend echo Charles whatever graphic in you know when I
[01:18:29] talk I think anyway I don't know I could be wrong here maybe I'm trying to just support the point
[01:18:35] you know bring it down to every day level right on I think there's a lot of supporters out there at
[01:18:40] least yeah the radio discipline thing isn't weird to this idea that everyone in combat each
[01:18:48] individual believes his case is a special one that's such a derogatory statement and you know what's
[01:18:55] funny about that derogatory statement everyone that hears it thinks they're talking about someone else
[01:19:02] like that's not me but it is you you are talking and no one wants to hear you and what you have to
[01:19:09] say isn't that important is that kind of like talking about your dreams with your friend
[01:19:15] you ever like to ever get your friend but I can't you know if I can you know when your friend
[01:19:22] is like hey I had the stream last night and it was but and it's not about you or nothing but
[01:19:26] this is just the weirdest dream aren't you like brow who cares you know but if you ever find
[01:19:31] yourself telling whoever about your dream it seems like it's so interesting it was just so bizarre
[01:19:36] and all this stuff you know the person is like bro you're quiet you know radio sound resounding metaphor
[01:19:43] complete capture documents big section about a ponsourcing the bodies they found a map of
[01:20:00] the second lieutenant and dispatch immediately to the regimental command post by runner next day
[01:20:04] the translation of this map is returned to first battalion it showed the Japanese defensive plan
[01:20:09] and proved very effective in eliminating Japanese from that area when they attacked it not only marked
[01:20:15] maps but also documents of less apparent importance may furnish the key to enemy plans
[01:20:20] when combined with other information the necessity for prompt forwarding to higher headquarters
[01:20:27] of all captured documents must be impressed on all ranks and I'll tell you why I wanted to bring that
[01:20:31] up because this is something we get told about until all the time is you know hey look you might
[01:20:36] find a piece of paper that's got the word purple on it and you bring that you know hey this what
[01:20:43] I found on target that could be some code word that you didn't know about it and it's it
[01:20:48] you don't know so whenever you think you know you're wrong whenever you think all that doesn't
[01:20:57] mean anything you're wrong and so when someone is talking to you and you think you know you're wrong
[01:21:03] you don't know they got some perspective that you don't know so listen to it listen to it
[01:21:10] I have to put myself in checks sometimes when I'll get asked a question like what working with a client
[01:21:16] and someone will give me a question and I'm telling you I have you I know you you have to
[01:21:23] experience this two-day someone someone raised their hand hey I want to know when it comes to
[01:21:29] cover move if I'm working with another department and they don't we already know where that
[01:21:34] question is going right there's like a 98% chance that we know that they're going to say hey
[01:21:38] this other department doesn't care about me and they don't really support us so what what what
[01:21:42] what am I supposed to do then just keep so what we we've heard that question we hear that question
[01:21:45] a lot I always have to put myself in check because just because I think that's what they're going
[01:21:52] to say doesn't mean that's what they're going to say it doesn't mean that there's not some
[01:21:56] nuance to it doesn't mean that I can spit out some module about how you you know well you
[01:22:01] continue to support them no listen to what they're saying don't stop them from talking
[01:22:10] you know the the minute somewhere I see this in group dynamics you know there's a discussion going on
[01:22:15] and someone's talking and someone else someone else in the group will cut them off
[01:22:22] and this is another thing I talked about on the F online think about how disrespeckful it is
[01:22:30] to cut someone off right like you might not say anything to me but if you're talking and I just jump
[01:22:34] in cut you off and just just without regard just just start to cut you off think about how
[01:22:41] do you consider that disrespectful echo trails yes or anything most people recognize that that is
[01:22:46] disrespectful and so they try to stop themselves from doing it they can't always control their
[01:22:51] egos they can't always like let it continue and I'll tell you I think being on podcast have you
[01:22:58] ever noticed when two people that have podcasts are on the same podcast they'll let the other
[01:23:04] person talk and it sort of let the person complete thoughts because podcasts is sort of an amplified
[01:23:08] version of if all of a sudden we're talking over each other it's just painful to listen to but then
[01:23:13] if you get someone that's not really a podcast type person or haven't hasn't done a lot of
[01:23:18] time they'll be jumping in and wanting to talk and it makes it hard to listen to so to me I think
[01:23:25] that's that's enhanced my my my listening right because I if I have a guest on here and they want to
[01:23:33] talk it's like okay I'm gonna let them complete their sentence and what I've realized over the years
[01:23:37] is that when I let someone do that there's usually some nuggets in there that I didn't know about
[01:23:41] so I'm actually gonna listen to what you have to say and the minute when I hear someone at
[01:23:46] you know at a will be working with a company and you'll hear someone say you know someone's
[01:23:50] mid sentence and boom gets cut off and overrun and here's what I was explaining on a F online the other
[01:23:56] day we all recognize that as disrespectful but it's seldom that we recognize the opposite which is
[01:24:05] when I'm listening to you I am showing you respect and you subconsciously know that like the
[01:24:12] the person that you're talking to when you listen to them they subconsciously feel respected
[01:24:17] which is a good which is a great thing because we're trying to build a relationship we're trying
[01:24:20] to build trust and it's incredible how this tool of listening is so powerful in increasing
[01:24:27] the trust in relationships that we can work to better together as a team and yet it's neglected all the
[01:24:32] time because I think oh I already know what Dave is going to say so I'm just gonna bud in and start to tell
[01:24:40] what I think well I am disrespecting Dave contrary if Dave is talking and I listen to him and I
[01:24:48] nod my head and say up I hear what you're saying and I let him complete his thoughts not only am I not
[01:24:53] disrespecting him I am respecting him and damn if you don't see some just mayhem go watch the news
[01:25:02] it's insanity it's total insanity not just the news casters themselves or the guests that they
[01:25:09] have come on for three minutes to yell at each other but go watch some you know two people in this
[01:25:14] day and age or five people or a hundred people arguing with each other no one's listening anybody
[01:25:20] why jump into that bar fight right this is a verbal bar fight which I obviously can escalate into
[01:25:26] real fights and real problems nowadays we're seeing all kinds of mayhem out in streets and that
[01:25:31] mayhem is being caused by the fact that no one's listening to each other and it starts with the
[01:25:35] disrespect if I'm not going to listen to you and by the way when you when I cut you off and then
[01:25:41] you try and cut me off back what's my response I get louder and then you get louder and now we're
[01:25:48] escalating next thing you know we're from one punch next thing you know we're having
[01:25:51] hooking bottles and bricks and shooting tear gas and we got a real freaking problem
[01:25:57] because we don't listen to each other yeah a lot of times though when when I witness that
[01:26:04] or see it or whatever I think anyway comes not necessarily overtly disrespect but it's almost
[01:26:10] like an absence of respect because more like they're just distracted or maybe just focused on their
[01:26:16] own like what they have to say or their own significance or whatever right so how you said yeah
[01:26:23] because if I think I know what Dave's going to say I'm going to cut him off and that's true
[01:26:27] and even if it's subconscious it's true you know because if I don't know what you're going to say
[01:26:31] and I'm like kind of curious I'm going to I'm going to wait to hear it you know but a lot of times
[01:26:36] people they're either think they know what they're going to say or they're too eager about what
[01:26:42] they want to say right so it kind of a lot of times it comes back to like what kind of person you
[01:26:46] are you know so if you're like hey everything that comes out of my mouth is just go
[01:26:53] you'll probably interrupt people more like I tend to see that kind of pattern you know for sure
[01:27:00] and there's I will say the main time when I jump in on somebody is like I've got something
[01:27:07] flashing through my brain and I don't want to lose it yeah you don't want to forget it there is that
[01:27:12] to you and yeah that actually seems like a legitimate like reason to interrupt sometimes yeah
[01:27:21] but it's one of those things and I think like you said a couple times or it's like oh yeah
[01:27:24] it might must not have been that important or whatever you know if you forget it but here's the
[01:27:28] thing though there's a little dichotomy on that one too what if Dave's over here talking like so much
[01:27:33] he said so many things that reached like straightaway acquired me and interrupt me like hey I
[01:27:37] got to stop you there you know like that kind or it's like hey that's not I got to stop you there you
[01:27:41] know kind of thing but I didn't I just let him go meanwhile he left me with 47 things that
[01:27:48] require my rebuttal or whatever and I didn't interrupt them it's kind of like yeah that's a challenge
[01:27:53] yeah but at the end of the day big picture you might as well just be like well at least I listen
[01:27:59] to Dave and everything yet to say yeah I mean obviously we could break down sort of break down the
[01:28:04] social dynamics of situations where you know you'll find some disagreement with you now I will
[01:28:09] tell you I am much better off if Dave is saying something that I disagree with I am much better off
[01:28:16] most of the time letting him say what it is that I disagree with rather than just jumping in and being like
[01:28:22] that that look it's it's disrespectful I'm clearly not listening to you
[01:28:26] right I'm cutting you off yeah so why am I behaving that way it's not good look if you
[01:28:36] if Dave wants to talk for seven minutes and rattle off you know like you said 47 points
[01:28:43] maybe at some point I go you know maybe at some point I say hey can I just can we can we kind of
[01:28:48] address these things one at a time because you've you've just said three different things and
[01:28:52] I'm gonna I'm gonna get lost in what you're saying and and I want to talk about that first thing
[01:28:57] I think you could do that respectfully yeah like you got to put effort into the respectful part of
[01:29:01] you know like I can respectfully interrupt really but if you're just throwing out interruptions yes
[01:29:06] disrespectful there's certainly different modalities of interruption that are that are
[01:29:13] you know wildly differently from and you know it's cool what's interesting is when you are
[01:29:20] face to face with somebody you can tell when the person wants to say something right you can
[01:29:25] let's look at the face and they get a face and they have a non-verbal communication telling you
[01:29:29] I got something to say right now and if if I'm if Dave's giving me that look
[01:29:35] my my respect to him is to go he's got something to say time to give him a moment
[01:29:41] yeah and the I think well I'm speaking from experience and I don't have much but
[01:29:49] well actually no I do have a lot of experience listening to people talk but if you if you
[01:29:55] have a situation where okay the person is talking and they're saying all crazy stuff right
[01:30:00] that kind of requires some correction or some interruption right or some discussion at
[01:30:05] an minimum yeah so unless you guys are actively working on solving a specific problem we can
[01:30:10] which can happen like in work or in a family or whatever but you know how some people they just
[01:30:13] like to talk and we're just having a friend and conversation whatever and they're just
[01:30:17] blabbing at the same things that are just some are true some are not true and they're just going
[01:30:21] on and on like they're all all correct right and then won't be quite you might as well just not
[01:30:27] say anything because at the end of the day it it does you better to just listen to everything they
[01:30:33] said and you know you know what you know the old saying like yeah you don't want to talk
[01:30:36] you want to listen because now you know everything you already know and then you know what they
[01:30:40] know kind of thing you're with them yeah that's that's from this podcast as a matter of fact
[01:30:45] oh there you go boom so so it's like that kind of situation you know like you're not you're not
[01:30:50] tasked necessarily to to effectively change someone's mind every single time so you might as well
[01:30:57] just keep your mouth shut a lot of the time I mean let's face it if you're going to have a
[01:31:01] discussion with someone to try and try and consolidate your ideas together to become to come up
[01:31:08] with a the strongest idea then you have to converse with them and whether there are subordinate
[01:31:14] or a superior or a peer at some point you know in order to progress ideas you have to
[01:31:22] converse with them and just sitting there and remaining silent when people are saying things that
[01:31:27] you totally disagree with or to put in a better way you don't fully understand their perspective
[01:31:33] then we have to uncover that perspective a little bit and you do that by asking questions and
[01:31:39] trying to figure out where they are coming from yeah you know I'm totally recalling of
[01:31:46] very specific situation recently whereas the middle of this straight up argument debate
[01:31:51] social situation about political causes I political things and I just witness just may
[01:31:57] I'm going back and forth I'm saying anything yeah that's just jumping into a bar fight that
[01:32:02] you're not but I'm thinking like hey either one of you guys could easily just be quiet and
[01:32:08] listen and not saying anything for the rest of the whole time or whatever and this whole like
[01:32:14] we'd all be better off it's kind of like one of those situations so I'm totally projecting that right
[01:32:20] now until this situation what are you writing down there do there's a lot there's a lot and what you just said
[01:32:31] you're thinking you're just talking about when you're sitting there watching these other two people
[01:32:37] and when you're watching these other two people have like what is kind of like a ridiculous
[01:32:41] conversation with an arguing you're just sort of the news or whatever and we're all just sitting
[01:32:45] there as observers and it looks completely ridiculous to us as observers you see it escalating
[01:32:50] you see it going nowhere you see people digging in and when you're just watching it it's obvious
[01:32:56] how completely ridiculous it is the comment earlier is like that feeling that when we have something to say
[01:33:04] it's different and this needs to be said remember that when you're about to open your mouth somebody
[01:33:09] else is going to watch it and you're going to look every bit is ridiculous to them as they did to you
[01:33:16] when you're talking about listening and I have learned this in my life I have learned to have a bias
[01:33:22] to not talk I learned that skill wasn't born with that skill I don't think anybody would
[01:33:27] accuse 20-year-old Dave of having a bias for listening that's a learned thing that I have
[01:33:32] done in my life the trick there is what you have said a thousand times is you actually have to
[01:33:38] listen because of what you said before just if I'm talking and you're letting me talk and I think
[01:33:43] you're listening to me I'll talk I'll keep doing with you but the second I catch you the
[01:33:49] I roll at the heavy breeze or whatever you're going to do and like do this guys listen into me
[01:33:55] you actually have to listen and the only way you will truly listen to what the other person says
[01:34:01] is if in your mind you believe that you might get something out of it because if you think you're like
[01:34:05] I'll do it here goes echo he's going to just go do what he does and it's going to be a complete waste of time
[01:34:11] the minute I do that I'm going to miss something and the actual listening part is a lot harder than
[01:34:19] it sounds because the conversation you're having your head which is I know I'm right all these
[01:34:23] points are wrong all these things are saying you're just complete waste the active listening piece
[01:34:27] better come from a place of authenticity or you need to get found out in a second because your
[01:34:31] body language is going to give the whole thing away and then you might as well just come off right
[01:34:34] there because they're not listening because he knows you're not listening to me yeah there's a
[01:34:39] lot with that and it symbols it sounds to listen if it was so easy wouldn't have to say it
[01:34:44] over again you're all fighting the urge like to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:34:51] check a little section to hear about just just foratization with the prisoners
[01:35:00] and and that they could not do that which is the reason the reason I said that is because
[01:35:06] here are these guys are trying to kill you for me this is just shows you the
[01:35:13] the predominant spirit spirit of the American servicemen it says here it was necessary
[01:35:21] repeatedly to warn the troops against incorrect practice of fratizing with prisoners and
[01:35:25] giving them cigarettes which interfered with the proper interrogation troops had to be warned
[01:35:29] not to remove paybooks from the prisoners because these books furnished a check to the interrogation
[01:35:34] officer of the prisoner's statements in regard to his organization previous service so there's just
[01:35:39] these you wouldn't think that after these guys are trying to kill you that you'd want to
[01:35:44] give them a cigarette right and yet respect speed marching commanding general third division
[01:35:59] Sicily the importance of physical condition cannot be over emphasized speed marching proved of
[01:36:04] great value in developing physical condition eliminating the unfit and instilling confidence
[01:36:09] impride in the individual as a general training objective all units prepared for landing on
[01:36:17] defended beaches and an advance inland of about five miles speed marching continued each unit
[01:36:23] being required to complete five miles in one hour eight miles in two hours and 20 miles in five hours
[01:36:28] once a week this training was largely responsible for the speed with which the assault of this
[01:36:34] division was executed there you go physical conditioning it he points out this and this is so obvious
[01:36:48] instilling confidence impride mean what a factor what a factor who ate the warrior kid books you know
[01:36:56] get a kid that doesn't will can't do a pull-up right and also you can do a pull-up you can lift your own
[01:37:03] weight you can stand up a little straighter and get your team working out to what I'm saying
[01:37:12] writing messages reports and messages major Robert Wilson field artillery
[01:37:18] Italy the who what when where and why we're often not contained in reports both oral and written
[01:37:24] battalion regimental s-tos and the men themselves indicated that during maneuvers and in training
[01:37:29] problems they had thought that this subject had been mastered but that in combat it was ignored
[01:37:33] or forgotten as to clarity the axiom of a message can be understood it will be missed if a message
[01:37:39] can be misunderstood it will be misunderstood was well proven the comment here writing messages during
[01:37:46] a unit training program is one thing writing clear specifically worded messages and orders
[01:37:53] under combat conditions is quite another theoretical training and message writing must be
[01:37:59] supplemented by constant practice and supervision in the field that why I was an English major
[01:38:08] so I could learn how to write section here on dirt breeding infection half the
[01:38:16] vacuations from the battalion was due to infection caused by minor scratches and to that I would say
[01:38:23] I'd get yourself some warrior kid sop so you could stay oh come on this is another one of those
[01:38:31] life ones a fox hole in time saves lives lieutenant crawl bowguard infantry fifth army Italy
[01:38:39] although the average american soldier will dig a fox hole or slit trench when the artillery or
[01:38:45] mortar shells are falling in his vicinity only a few of those I saw would dig them
[01:38:52] prior to that time when they did dig them they were usually quite shallow it was always very easy
[01:39:00] to tell a German fox hole from the american the former were always much deeper many casualties
[01:39:05] occurred from shell fire which I believe would have been avoided had proper fox holes or slit trench
[01:39:10] been dug in and this is you know the code the evaluation of protocol are you prepared for life
[01:39:17] emergencies are you prepared for emergency situations we as americans I totally agree with this we don't
[01:39:25] like to worry about anything until it slaps us in the face in fact in the seal teams I used to tell
[01:39:29] my leadership no one worries about anything until they get slapped in the face with it like no one's
[01:39:34] really concerned about that until you get hit with it and all of a sudden you got to execute that
[01:39:37] mission and you're not the gear that you need so let's get the gear we need let's get do the rehearsals
[01:39:41] we're supposed to do be proactive I can kind of go for little things to over 100% goes to little
[01:39:50] things but well yeah so these and these little things can kind of get sold the other night
[01:39:56] metal it's bedtime we'll go sleep right in the middle of the night here
[01:40:02] you know what that is right no idea your uh permanent security or a fire detector with a nine
[01:40:08] volt battery that's dead that's dying exactly right and brought you inside you think you can if you don't
[01:40:13] have nine volt batteries at what three a m and nowhere they are and nowhere they are yeah but listen you
[01:40:21] don't have them straight up I mean let's face it did you just have random nine volt batteries in your
[01:40:25] in your house yes I know exactly where they are so have to do for each fire detector in my house
[01:40:31] here's the thing I may father now so so do I oh yeah so do I but I'll tell you this before I had
[01:40:37] kids before I had a thing life whatever that's my protection I didn't have nine volt batteries
[01:40:46] just hanging around straight up didn't have didn't even think about it years oh yeah 100% I
[01:40:50] guess my wife when she was growing up they they didn't have batteries like you know the
[01:40:55] her mom and dad just batteries weren't on the list yeah and so my wife is a battery a
[01:41:01] horror and stockpiler you want a nine volt you want a triple A double A what do you want C.C.
[01:41:08] open up that cabinet they're in there they're ready for I'm with you my wife the exact same
[01:41:13] she gets a little bit excited when the batteries run out on something she gets a little bit
[01:41:16] you know it's like hey the batteries out on this thing hold on and she goes and digs out of
[01:41:22] C.E.2.3.2.5 for my watch actually I think my watch is F.32.32 yeah this was gonna say
[01:41:31] that's the C.3 that one's I think that's a scale you put that in one of those little scales
[01:41:36] it might be that well I don't know either way yeah I don't know either but I do know that I did
[01:41:41] have a nine volt battery that night but I was thinking to myself probably what if I didn't have a nine
[01:41:45] volt battery right no we're not sleeping tonight you're only you're not sleeping then that and it
[01:41:50] doesn't have to do just that night now you got the whole next day you got to contend with
[01:41:53] you seem saying I'm really very this is your paranoid no a fire or that beep is bothering you the
[01:42:00] beep is gonna keep you up I'm with you man that's that's the kiss kiss I'll tell you what happens
[01:42:06] it turns out that that fire detector that beeps every 60 seconds can't be destroyed yeah you could
[01:42:13] take a sledgehammer to it and just breaking it without it will still beep so when you're talking
[01:42:18] about that's the slap in the face which is a totally unprepared for the situation now you're up
[01:42:22] all night you think you solve the problem the second you get in the bed lights out covers
[01:42:27] babe I got a sort beep and then you're up again some with you that's true I learned this lesson
[01:42:35] 30 years ago so I've got those nine volts at the ready yes sir yeah and in one time you know how I found
[01:42:40] that out that you can't you can't stop that thing I was like okay I was a gas no problem like I'll
[01:42:45] just take out the battery how can I beep with no power simply can't be it can't happen so like
[01:42:50] you know where's it get the power to beep from where does that come from apparently they thought
[01:42:55] ahead you know in the case of a really emergency it's one of those things and a little bit more
[01:42:59] important then you're sweet that night if you're unprepared you know so it made sense when I
[01:43:03] kind of thought through it but nonetheless I'll still face with this problem like this beeping
[01:43:07] lucky it wasn't in the middle of the night but whatever so I said yeah I got a job I
[01:43:13] would have a real problem that day but I had to put it in the drawer you could still hear but it was
[01:43:18] just way way more quiet so any got a battery whatever later on yeah I can't be disabled that's
[01:43:24] the whole reason if it's not a disaster I cannot can't be far from doing it for you there but yeah
[01:43:29] man nonetheless that's the point it can go for small things too seems saying they'd probably just
[01:43:34] be prepared how about this how about just keep some nine volt batteries oh good probably three
[01:43:39] m three p.m whenever you go oh better it's better you slow you know we good over there I
[01:43:45] click turn also with that alright let's move on section three mountain operations they go through a big
[01:43:52] batang in attack here going to a lot of detail it's another another from another perspective on the
[01:43:58] battle on the atto island and there's there's some detail there's some maps and charts and you
[01:44:06] should go check it out online so you can kind of get the full benefit of that but I just wanted to hit a
[01:44:09] couple highlights and we're going back to communications here a rather elaborate system of communications
[01:44:14] was established to enable the batang commander to control the fire of supporting weapons in further
[01:44:20] instead of tactical plans the artillery radar radio as well as telephone was set up at the batang
[01:44:26] commanders OP on top of the hogback which is one of these little terrain features a sound power
[01:44:32] telephone was run from the mortar OP back to the batang commander likewise one from the 75's the
[01:44:38] telephone was also run from the OP to the officer in charge of all 37 millimeter firing radio and
[01:44:45] telephone control was run to all companies in the batang so the reason I highlight that that's a lot of
[01:44:52] communications and if we're counting on all those communications we may not get what we might not get what we want
[01:45:01] goes into this here they get into contact we saw the first one at 0 4 30 in the morning he was
[01:45:09] a centering we were then 50 yards of him he stood up against the skyline it was shaking out a
[01:45:14] grass mat lieutenant brown motion to us to get up a little under the ledge to our front and then he shot
[01:45:21] the jab the shot must have awakened others as we worked up over the ledge a jab machine
[01:45:26] gunner began firing at us we stayed down until the first excited burst had gone over then we raised
[01:45:32] up and returned fire several jabs had holes near the edge of the ledge we were under and they
[01:45:36] began to throw grenades over but the hill below is so steep that most of the grenades rolled down
[01:45:41] and exploded out of range below us the machine gun was firing again but several of our men were close
[01:45:48] enough to to the ledge to lob grenades over the machine gun itself was out of grenade range
[01:45:53] but some of the jabs near the edge caught hell from the grenades are you feeling lucky when the
[01:46:05] people that are throwing grenades at you they like bounce over your position and don't hurt you I
[01:46:10] think that might have been my whole point there the radio fails so this is why I get concerned about
[01:46:17] about communications and as a former radio minute definitely freaks me out lieutenant brown try to
[01:46:23] again and again to contact battalion headquarters or the artillery and I'm fast forwarding a little bit
[01:46:27] or the artillery with the radio but the set refused to function the radio man worked with it and
[01:46:32] tried again but failed the button was reorganizing we started up again they're assaulting the
[01:46:36] hill we got as high as the ledge once more and had started over the top on the table above
[01:46:42] when the jab opened up with machine guns again we needed artillery and needed it bad every time
[01:46:47] we stuck our noses up a hail storm of bullets cracked across them the radio man was trying
[01:46:52] frantically to contact anybody in the valley below us but the set remained silent several men had
[01:46:58] crawled around to the left and through grenades at the jabs near the edge of the table but the
[01:47:03] machine guns remained out of range our men were driven back to the cover of the ledge with several
[01:47:09] wounds artillery if we only had artillery we could observe the fire we knew where the guns were
[01:47:15] if we could only get some fire we'd walk over the damn mountains the radio man was desperate
[01:47:20] he tried to set again but it was silent in a rage he threw it down the hill yeah so there's a
[01:47:30] bunch of things to think about there just you know your communications cannot be relied upon
[01:47:35] you have to have some kind of backup plan and if you're if you're expecting you can be able to
[01:47:41] make communications when when they're really gonna be needed that is the time they're gonna fail
[01:47:46] that is Murphy's law if you say okay Dave here's gonna happen we have this whole complicated plan and then when you get to
[01:47:51] this point radio me and that's when we'll execute that radio call has a 4% chance of making
[01:47:59] communications if everything hinges upon one call the weight of that hinge just just has
[01:48:07] carmatic is that a word a carmic carmic impact on that communication system and it's not going to work great so
[01:48:18] their attack gets repulsed he says he said we heard the guns in a valley begin firing the attack
[01:48:25] was on we had failed and we felt bad about it bad that they had the drop on us they go into the main attack
[01:48:32] the japs were holding the pass on the high ground on both sides in the front two the ones on the
[01:48:36] right could fire into the backs the attackers of the left and vice versa it was rough going
[01:48:42] lieutenant clevsie got me up and we went around the second section to get them started up
[01:48:48] hill the attack was going okay but it was an awfully tough one bullets were flying all over the
[01:48:53] hillside just up hill from the second section was a jab 37 millimeter we had watched them fire
[01:48:58] from that position several days before and we knew there were japs in that trench the main attack
[01:49:03] was moving around to the left as we started up the hill finally the fire got so heavy that the
[01:49:08] machine gun squad took cover in a little draw until we grenade the trench above us to clean it out
[01:49:16] then they were to come on up sergeant tom kovic private first class William Marshall and I started
[01:49:22] up with lieutenant clevsie we had crawled on our bellies to within 25 yards of the trench
[01:49:28] when a sniper raised up and shot Marshall in the air we shot at the sniper we threw grenades into
[01:49:33] the trench we crawled up rapidly then ready to move in behind our grenades and another sniper
[01:49:38] poppies head up out of the hole just above us lieutenant clevsie fired his car being just as the
[01:49:43] jab fire lieutenant toppled over a little bank and lay still he was dead I was just bringing up the
[01:49:49] rifle as the jab my rifle as the jab ducked then from across the valley the jab spotted us
[01:49:55] and they gave us hell machine guns rifles in 37 millimeter began pounding the area finally the
[01:50:00] intense shelling slowed down and we dashed for the open end of the jab trench we had grenadeed
[01:50:05] the trench led around to the point of the hill we crawled down the trench and found where the
[01:50:09] japs were located when we stuck our heads right up in the face of a burst of machine gun fire
[01:50:15] some men from company f had come over to help us but we're stymied we couldn't raise up long enough
[01:50:20] to fire we couldn't get close enough to throw grenades finally we decided to see if we could
[01:50:24] get some mortar fire on the position in some way corporal outford hayman started back up
[01:50:30] to check on the mortar possibilities and while we waited and rested the jab position was slightly
[01:50:36] below us and about a hundred yards further into the pass they were firing almost constantly at
[01:50:41] the troops we could see moving out in the valley and on the opposite side of the pass we were quite
[01:50:46] high up on the side of cold mountain after nearly two hours of lying in the trench and waiting
[01:50:51] we heard one of the men behind holler here he men up here he men and a man from company h the
[01:50:58] infantry were crawling up along the little ravine laying wire they had found a company h mortar
[01:51:03] and had a line right to it the big fight up on the mountain had almost gotten to the top
[01:51:08] but the forces across the pass were getting hell from the guns below us we got the phone all set
[01:51:13] up and carefully poked a little dirt a little hole in the dirt side of the trench a week so that
[01:51:19] one man could see the whole jab position below then we called mortar and the fun started
[01:51:25] we were only about a hundred yards from where the shells were striking in the ground shook
[01:51:29] they fired several rounds close and then they began to drop right in the position finally we called
[01:51:35] and told them we were moving in and not to fire the position was like a big wheel
[01:51:39] was a big wheel like a fair with holes all around it and the spokes connecting the trenches
[01:51:44] with a big center installation in the hub two Japanese machine guns in the 37 millimeter
[01:51:49] that had fired at us during the previous week were captured and destroyed there we tossed six dead
[01:51:55] japs out the hole and brought them brought up our guns up and set them in the jap holes we there we
[01:52:02] sat that night just daring the little so and so has to come up man what positions they had
[01:52:08] one little fight with in a battle you know one little tiny fight with in a battle and
[01:52:27] think of all those decisions that got made and all those actions that took place in the
[01:52:31] mistakes that had to be covered for and the initiative that had to be shown and the bravery
[01:52:37] and the courage I mean it's just it's leadership that's that's what it is it's leadership
[01:52:49] they they go through a bunch of this information continuing on they there's another group
[01:52:58] that takes another point and and again
[01:53:00] look these guys I can pretty much guarantee are no longer alive but this is these are quotes
[01:53:09] these are what these guys are saying happened you know things like lieutenant wallsack
[01:53:18] saying check your bayonets as they get ready to do this assault
[01:53:21] and there's just so there's some some other little battles within fights within battles that
[01:53:30] they cover and then it gets into this comment section these accounts bring out some of the
[01:53:38] characteristics of mountain warfare in which success depends more upon proper adaptation of
[01:53:44] available means to the terrain then upon their power so the way you adapt is more important
[01:53:54] they continue maneuver of small units and the initiative and leadership of subordinate
[01:54:01] commanders are of the highest importance in mountain warfare the actions of small semi-independent
[01:54:09] units in seizing or defending heights and or in fighting to seize or block passes become of
[01:54:17] increasing importance so once again even though this book starts off with the extreme dichotomy
[01:54:26] of discipline of following orders it comes back always to decentralize command an individual
[01:54:33] initiative by subordinate leaders to make things happen he's talking about mountain warfare there
[01:54:43] and and getting to this idea of I mean that's it that's leadership right it's leadership is
[01:54:48] going to be the deciding factor here because the terrain is so it's so impossible to predict there's
[01:54:55] so many different things in places and outcropping it all these different and even tell the story
[01:55:00] what great position they had in that previous example with the Japanese life is more like a mountain
[01:55:06] warfare than it is going to be these big open fields if your life can just reveal themselves and
[01:55:10] just going to plan your your move down down the road there are so many things that are popping
[01:55:15] up when we're talking to companies right now they're describing that same terrain in their business
[01:55:22] lives of all these unproductive and unexpected things and it isn't the strength of their brand
[01:55:28] and it isn't you know the quality it's the leadership that's navigating these companies through
[01:55:32] when we're talking about the terrain of mountain warfare that's what life is it's not just this
[01:55:40] easy straight road from A to B you're just marched down and everything is it's clean
[01:55:46] and how crazy that has to be that at every single turn something comes up and the tool that
[01:55:51] you the only tool that you have to get past that is leadership and you know what I like
[01:55:56] also about this analogy and the way it ties into the entire concept of yes of leadership but
[01:56:04] really even more specifically to ownership and extreme ownership and and that is this this is
[01:56:11] what's so beautiful about this you can't move those mountains you cannot do you cannot those
[01:56:21] mountains are what they are and that's what that's what what triggered that fought my mind was you
[01:56:25] said there's all these variables but what's interesting is you're looking at them you know for
[01:56:32] days you understand you can see it on the map you can look at it there's this mountain and you know what
[01:56:38] you can't move that mountain and what you have to do is you have to move yourself and this is
[01:56:43] you know we talk about this in GG2 and someone's across the side on you I can bench press you
[01:56:48] uninch you know maybe two inches I don't care if you have a 500 pound bench press when you've
[01:56:53] got a person that's mobile and they're they're securing you and they've got your chest compress
[01:57:00] but you can't bench press them off of you you can move them just enough then you have to move
[01:57:06] it's incumbent upon you and so we can't move mountains what we have to do is adapt what we have to
[01:57:13] figure out how to utilize us things and what the important thing is even though we can't move
[01:57:19] those mountains the person that figures out how to utilize that terrain is the one that's going to win
[01:57:27] you utilize the terrain it's something that I have no control over but I control how I interact
[01:57:32] with that mountain and I know where I need to be and I know I understand the angles and I understand
[01:57:36] what ravine will give me cover and I understand where it exposes me well even he's talking about hey
[01:57:41] this the way the Japanese were set up and was like oh they can hit these guys here in the
[01:57:46] flank and they can shoot these guys in the back that's the position that they have that's a freaking
[01:57:50] horrible situation to be rolling into horrible situation to be rolling into so when you look at things
[01:57:59] instead of sitting there and going saying I wish the market was different I wish the competitor
[01:58:04] would do something different I wish my employees would act in a different way these are all things
[01:58:10] that you can look at you can wish all day long just like you can wish that mountain moves but
[01:58:14] that mountain's not going anywhere so you need to maneuver you need to take ownership of that
[01:58:19] situation and make things happen there's a whole bunch of sections here engineer operations tanks
[01:58:30] infantry notes and jungle operations one one section here Japanese centers of resistance were bypassed
[01:58:39] and isolated again how often do we say oh Dave doesn't like this part of my plan so I'm going to
[01:58:47] attack him on that instead of saying okay Dave's going to dig in right there cool I'm going to
[01:58:51] maneuver around it right bypass I'm going to start thinking about that a little bit more often
[01:58:56] in my daily life well how can I bypass maybe not when it comes to working out because echo
[01:58:59] Charles pointed out that might not be the best plan but if it's things that I don't want to engage in
[01:59:05] why am I engaging in them if I don't have to if I can isolate and bypass and not make it part of my
[01:59:10] gig that's fine frontal attacks were uniformly successful when assisted by a flank attack
[01:59:23] on many occasions the flank attack preceded the frontal attack coming into Japanese positions
[01:59:28] from the rear and completely disrupting their defense plans and almost all cases the maneuver
[01:59:33] used by units of all sizes from division to squad was the development of one or both flanks
[01:59:40] yeah resistance was made by resistance was bypassed encircled and reduced later
[01:59:46] so the frontal assault works when it's not actually a frontal assault that's awesome
[01:59:50] frontal assault works when you're doing something else as well yes that's so legit
[01:59:54] section on section on automatic weapons night operations security measures security at night
[02:00:06] lines of communication patrol reports in general the distance covered by the patrols was much less
[02:00:13] than expected of them the difficulties of terrain caused by many patrol leaders to feel that they
[02:00:19] had covered two or three times as much ground than they had actually covered this must be taken
[02:00:23] to account when evaluating patrol reports these are people that think that they know like hey
[02:00:29] I was there in that crazy you could be looking at me totally convinced that you went to
[02:00:35] kilometers and it turns out when we retrace your steps you went whatever 700 yards 700 meters
[02:00:46] one last section to cover here yeah this last section is very interesting
[02:00:53] evacuation methods informal report salomon islands evacuation of casualties was by hand carry
[02:01:03] litter bearers cable litter slings across jungle gollies improvised sleds or drags down steep
[02:01:11] inclines improvised litter racks on quarter ton jeeps small boats on mountain streams or along the
[02:01:18] coast and finally by field ambulances to clearing stations or hospitals how's that for a nightmare
[02:01:28] when you when you were in found did you we ever down pilot yeah yeah did you get carried out on
[02:01:33] the letters yeah you go out in helicopter you stage there and then come on get you like the
[02:01:36] the metal the it's like a metal basket basically the litter did you ever get carried by a seal
[02:01:42] platoon like eight kilometers no okay I know exactly what you're talking about I was never the
[02:01:48] I was never the down air crew that got actually physically pulled right it's not fun when you're
[02:01:54] getting carried because you're getting dropped you're getting slammed you're getting all over the place
[02:01:58] and usually we would stick guys with IVs you know we're like we would try and do some medical training
[02:02:02] on as well but good lord I want you to think about everything that I just said hand carry
[02:02:12] cable litter's across jungle golly's improvise sleds drags down steep so you're wounded
[02:02:18] and what's the method of doing okay we're gonna drag you down a steep incline improvise
[02:02:23] litter on a on a quarter ton jeep imagine that thing bouncing around small boats think about a
[02:02:29] nightmare and this is where you start to realize what a nightmare I'm talking about
[02:02:35] evacuation by litter bears was difficult tiring time consuming and involved distances averaging
[02:02:44] two or three miles and five to six miles in some instances many more litter bears had to be
[02:02:52] utilized than under ordinary conditions litter carry in many cases required as high as
[02:02:59] 16 carriers per patient over almost impossible terrain and can be counted as least efficient
[02:03:10] so it takes 16 people to evacuate somebody two miles or three miles
[02:03:18] where evacuation by litter was necessary bearers worked in relays eight or even 16 men accompanying
[02:03:25] each litter leaving one another in litter carry and in cutting narrow paths through the dense jungle
[02:03:34] 16 people to move a wounded man I mean that's just crazy and obviously it wasn't all of them but
[02:03:44] they're saying hey sometimes it was eight and I'll tell you the the reason I was asking you if
[02:03:48] you'd ever been in that position number one you get beat up but you know when we would do desert training
[02:03:53] when I was running desert training men those guys would do some down man carries and I'm sure
[02:03:58] some of the guys that are here and we say in that an hour smiling with pleasant memories
[02:04:04] of going eight kilometers through the imperial valley desert carrying and eventually like the
[02:04:11] first you know if we had a troop that hadn't been through before or didn't have any experience say oh yeah
[02:04:18] hey which I'd you know what's your casualty evacuation plan oh we're just gonna put two guys on
[02:04:21] and we're gonna do a forget the name there's a couple carries you know there's a standard fireman's
[02:04:25] carry oh we're just gonna fireman's carry okay cool see how that see how that works out for you
[02:04:31] you can't I mean it's it's you can do it for 100 meters 200 meters 300 meters
[02:04:39] 400 meters you're on night vision you're in the worst freaking terrain rocks shale rocks
[02:04:47] all all over the place and it was great because as we would do these drills and as guys realized
[02:04:53] what a traumatic impact it was when you took casualties and how you had to adjust what you
[02:05:01] thought you'd be able to do because you can't just freaking rambo you can rambo somebody up I
[02:05:07] mean I've done it like okay grab a guy and I'm gonna carry 150 meters 200 meters
[02:05:11] by the time you get to that 200 meter mark like you're when you get to the spot you're just
[02:05:17] falling down with the guy 300 meters you're just falling down and you're exhausted and you've lost
[02:05:22] your weapon and your night vision and his gear's gone it's a disaster until you figure out okay
[02:05:28] when this happens here's what here's some procedures that we need to do
[02:05:31] talks about the improvised G bandulence is talks about evacuation by water
[02:05:46] physical fitness the arduous and fatiguing litter carrying demonstrated the need for physical
[02:05:52] fitness on the part of medical department personnel which should correct the impression that
[02:05:58] physically impaired individuals can be utilized throughout medical department activities
[02:06:06] so this idea that you can have a bunch of you know guy that's injured or hurt and have him
[02:06:11] broken in medical being a stretcher bearer is completely and utterly wrong and that's
[02:06:20] well that's a wrap on the highlights that I had from this
[02:06:23] and you know I I don't know when I think about this whole thing and we've been
[02:06:31] referring back to it the whole time that so many good lessons but the the the key take away
[02:06:37] for me is that whole idea of leader versus inertia and you know as soon as I said that
[02:06:44] today Dave I looked at you and I saw you had about a thousand thoughts going through your mind
[02:06:47] don't want that means and how many ways that we can apply that it's like the world is
[02:06:53] inspiring against us and it's human nature to neglect our duties and I know that sounds
[02:07:04] crazy and sure there's some outliers out there that are proactive and make things happen
[02:07:08] but you've got to assess as a leader that human nature is to be lazy and to be careless and
[02:07:15] you need definitely looking the mirror because it's not always just going to be the people that
[02:07:22] you lead it's going to be you and that section where they talk about the hardest job that you
[02:07:31] have as a leader is getting things done getting things done by people who know that they're
[02:07:37] supposed to do them and even in some cases know that those things are costing in lives failure to
[02:07:43] do things failure to take action so don't allow that be on the lookout how nice is it sometimes
[02:07:54] when you make the connection between something that's there that you've always known was there
[02:08:01] but you never p-i-d it and by that echo I mean positively identified like hey I know now
[02:08:07] everyone that's listening to this today now knows that that's a problem and look we all kind
[02:08:15] of knew it right I mean I talked about a discipline which we didn't feel man way I know
[02:08:18] or walk on a move like that's a real thing I get it we all kind of get it but how about the
[02:08:24] p-i-d on it and now when it starts happening either with you or with your team or with your family
[02:08:29] or with your friends you can p-i-d it and then you can address it properly and you can start with yourself
[02:08:39] you can start by making things happen
[02:08:49] speaking of making things happen echo Charles yes how can we do what we're supposed to do
[02:08:57] well we know we should do on top of p-i-d-ing it we p-i-d it oh yeah yeah something with complaining
[02:09:05] right remember we p-i-d that long time ago complaining uh blaming another one yeah there's
[02:09:10] two those are two good things once you recognize once you p-i-d those things man that blame
[02:09:15] one oh yeah because if you don't p-i-d the blame it'll like sneak in it it's like you're
[02:09:21] gonna wait with it dude really it's clear oh yeah you can be like yeah yeah I really shouldn't have
[02:09:26] done that you know it could have helped you know if you were to game the heads up or whatever but
[02:09:29] you write I shouldn't shouldn't have done that you see the blame like that's stupid mountain was
[02:09:34] totally blocking our position yeah kind of make it makes it kind of harder but no you're
[02:09:39] right I should have done it you same same see me taking ownership but slipping in the blame
[02:09:43] you can see the blame you can see it it's what I'm saying anyway so don't do that
[02:09:48] when you're um working out which okay so I worked out today actually I mean I thought about
[02:09:54] working out today but then I got into this deep conversation with my wife about some important
[02:10:00] stuff the window closed the window totally closed oh it closed it straight up closed yeah
[02:10:06] because the conversation went long I had to come here you see him same yeah I had a window
[02:10:11] closing last night it was I had something my wife was making dinner I was like I can fit in a
[02:10:20] run right now before dinner oh late workout no just a run I already worked out so run is not
[02:10:26] a workout there you are so late night so my wife was cooking dinner I had like a 40 minute window
[02:10:33] my wife says oh by the way someone's coming over to grab something I'm like okay the
[02:10:39] run's not happening now the windows just I'm kind of I'm kind of struggling it off like oh well
[02:10:43] you know we know closed you know but then I PID did and I said you know what I ate dinner which I
[02:10:49] ate I ate dinner and then I ran just and punished myself I pulled one of those before
[02:10:54] brother that's still true right there so that right there well you just did which went what
[02:10:59] you what you experienced same deal right you got the 40 minute window for running right
[02:11:05] because you got it all planned on your head it goes beyond the run it goes like the stuff you did
[02:11:09] before is in your mind stuff you're gonna do after the run dinner all this other stuff and the
[02:11:13] stuff after that in your mind does not include the run because the run is already done that's it that's
[02:11:19] whole formula right there in your mind so now that little window closed boom where is that run
[02:11:23] gonna fit in I already know in my mind what I'm gonna do after dinner which is after the run
[02:11:28] which already happened right when I'm doing put the run there no it's already occupied in your
[02:11:32] brain you see it's in but the thing doesn't work like that you put it there as essentially like an excuse
[02:11:39] yeah you know it's crazy so as I was running so now I'm running 20 minutes after I get done
[02:11:47] you yeah I don't think I've run on a full stomach for 15 years think about that 15 years I don't
[02:11:58] think and I don't think I'll run on a full stomach again for another 15 years because it felt
[02:12:02] very good awful and I don't roll I don't work out on a full stomach I don't like doing any
[02:12:07] that I can get away with like a workout depending on the workout not squatting on a full stomach
[02:12:12] because that's just not good but maybe I can do some pull ups on a full but yeah I was
[02:12:17] running on a full stomach I want to do that again I would next time because I wanted to you know
[02:12:22] like eat with my family you know that like let's eat time I would have eaten one forkful
[02:12:28] of food and not eaten and put it and then go for it's hang with the family go for run
[02:12:32] come back yeah that would be the power move and that's actually one of many power moves really
[02:12:37] the other power move is how about this yeah good for you you know running on a full stomach
[02:12:41] 15 years freaking run on a full stomach well I did that's what I'm saying no you know I'm saying
[02:12:45] like there's all kinds of things that you can just push through and still get it in this what I'm
[02:12:51] saying even all the way down to hey who cares if you're there if this person is coming over
[02:12:55] yeah that's that's that's that's the end of the world huh if you're not there you know not the
[02:13:00] end of the world but maybe not the best move at that time okay then we shift to the full stomach
[02:13:07] situation you did it you know or maybe the half stomach you know I'm just saying the opportunities
[02:13:12] always there you know this was in line with sort of this evolving attitude that I have now of of
[02:13:19] kind of a going hard against the weakness yeah I was like it's not only am I gonna run
[02:13:24] still I'm gonna run on a full stomach I just want a puke yeah all the freaking time because that's
[02:13:29] out you know so but I did the same exact thing but it was it was less complex for sure but it was
[02:13:34] like the window was closing like I can't get my full workout now because dinner time like I do you know
[02:13:40] I'm gonna eat dinner with the people you ever just do something super short and psycho though if you
[02:13:44] let the window close it but but you don't want to let it shut so you're like okay cool oh you want to be
[02:13:47] like that cool yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll do that a few times when I had to like come
[02:14:02] here somewhere where if I'm late it kind of affects other people you know it's like it's my fault
[02:14:07] anyway you know so oh yeah I'll do that kind of stuff for sure but I did it with the dinner thing
[02:14:11] and I did a Mac on a full stomach and I even told you about it the next house like I was doing
[02:14:16] anyway it's a long story but yeah well thank you time lines let's rock and roll man
[02:14:23] sir alright okay look we're doing workouts we're not doing excuses we're what fighting against
[02:14:27] week this punishing weakness we weakness thoughts we're punishing ourselves for those thoughts
[02:14:32] or considerations but when you do that you know you join your body's take a beating specifically
[02:14:37] your joints from time to time okay jocquoise supplementation for that so some moments are
[02:14:46] jockel fuel joint warfare for your joints super krill oil for your joints vitamin D
[02:14:54] is it super vitamin D we'll just say it's pretty good help it though so let's say super yeah super
[02:15:01] it's not called super vitamin D okay maybe we need to help with branding on that one
[02:15:05] no man like you helped us with super krill I didn't help you I don't want to get it funny
[02:15:10] either way it's vitamin D nonetheless I'm gonna change the name too super right
[02:15:15] and the old day yeah for 100% so you know get on now and also cold war
[02:15:23] was it called like some cold killer or something for you can't say that can't say that
[02:15:29] because it kills cold you can't say that that's bad advertising what's the word
[02:15:34] this act like making some kind of medical claim yeah medical claim so we can't say that but we can't
[02:15:41] go to war against cold yes missile of defense tank what was it different the tank the cold war
[02:15:48] missile defense I say that cold war missile defense yes I do oh day I fight the war against
[02:15:54] colds every day it's a shit it's also disciplined regular discipline and the supplementation
[02:16:02] discipline cans powder pills whatever you need whatever your modality yeah big time little
[02:16:10] psychological hitter little bit of little bit of go jocco Palmer taking the lead sorry
[02:16:18] is it taking the lead it's leading right now it's leading I agree yeah I agree first flavors go
[02:16:24] yeah I had the long drive to Montana 17 hours all one go one go no I mean I stopped for gas fuel
[02:16:35] of course yes but the cool thing was just kind of FYI for your research in the future two
[02:16:42] discipline go cans just one at about one at about one at about midnight maybe one a clock in the
[02:16:53] morning and I had another one at like two or three that's the kind of that's the that's the that's
[02:17:01] once the sun's coming up you're good once the sun comes up a rock and roll but there's I guess
[02:17:06] maybe around four o'clock in the morning like you don't see as soon as you start seeing sun your body
[02:17:10] goes oh cool we're awake now yeah it's that three 34 or four 30 where your body thinks you should
[02:17:16] be asleep right freaking now get that hitter boy 17 hour drive so when would you time it like
[02:17:25] when do you leave like nighttime essentially yeah yeah you're right post time dinner departure
[02:17:32] okay that's I did it I'm to get my driven 17 hours ever ever cool not sure oh value
[02:17:39] that information but yeah yeah so milk don't forget about milk don't forget about you you
[02:17:49] probably need extra protein I had a milk before I came here today just because I have
[02:17:54] doms sure and I was like meaning delayed onset muscle soreness sure little heavy on squads
[02:18:01] yesterday and I have a lot of doms so I just kicked down some milk little extra protein
[02:18:07] plus I was in the mood for dessert even though I didn't have any lunch so anyway it's all this

[02:20:46] time and we've been doing the podcast for five something like that coming up on five so that
[02:20:53] means for five complete years before this podcast the the one free t-shirt I had which I had a lot of them
[02:21:00] actually John Dudley asked me out there the we're off the Montana like the the fifth day in a row I
[02:21:05] posted up in a victory t-shirt he said do you just wear that or wash it or you have a thousand of
[02:21:12] my go not an a thousand of them but I got 10 yeah we have a light one and the dark one

[02:21:41] look if you want to know about new stuff or how should I want to know about new stuff Dave what
[02:21:47] sure does that this is a deaf core shirt but but it's available it's absolutely available it's called
[02:21:54] ops you have black ops you wear and he has I know I have the black one declassified let's
[02:22:00] call it a classified version but here's the deal the difference you know white shirt and a black shirt
[02:22:04] in the California sun is extreme yes sir so I like to wear a white shirt I don't have this one
[02:22:10] echo Charles yeah yeah thanks that must suck really but hey man you know I know that and maybe
[02:22:18] we'll get you on yeah so yes if you want a uh deaf core black ops or declassified
[02:22:26] talklstrad.com's you call it declassified yes I like it I like it when you sort of
[02:22:32] mingle with military turns you have some swings and you took a you have some misses
[02:22:38] don't know if you're suspect you you contact me yeah yeah say hey what would this be a correct
[02:22:44] usage of the word whatever yeah oftentimes I say yeah there is one thing I did and I think yeah
[02:22:53] it was you all the high speed low drag I was gonna use that in some it wasn't a shirt but it
[02:22:58] was in some other stuff I was doing and you're like hey don't do that don't do that because it
[02:23:04] wasn't like appropriate yeah I forget what it was because high speed low drag is definitely a term
[02:23:08] yes and it has a meaning I forget the way you used it I used it in a more serious way than it
[02:23:14] should be oh yeah that's not a serious term yeah it's kind of like that guy is high speed low drag yeah
[02:23:21] like for real it's kind of like you might say it about a pair of Gucci looking shooting classes yeah
[02:23:28] yeah that's what I learned oh yeah so anyway back to what I was saying hey if you want to get
[02:23:34] be in the know we have an email list on jocco store if you want to be in the know about some stuff
[02:23:39] I don't abuse this list at all in fact I underutilized it actually I tried trying my best to save
[02:23:46] it for important stuff the stuff that I think it's important so if you want to know about a new

[02:30:28] freedom and to the police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and
[02:30:36] dispatchers and correctional officers and border patrol and secret service thanks to all of you
[02:30:41] for protecting us and for keeping our nation a nation of law and order not a nation of chaos and
[02:30:50] anarchy into everyone else out there just just remember that the effect on most men
[02:31:02] of the impact of battle is to cause them to want to do nothing
[02:31:06] and it's the same thing with the slings and arrows of life we get pushed toward
[02:31:15] inaction and inactivity and indolence and the solution to that is that a determined effort must
[02:31:27] be exerted to accomplish things to accomplish tasks and that is on you and you know what that means
[02:31:38] it means get out there and get after it and until next time this is Dave and echo and jacco out
