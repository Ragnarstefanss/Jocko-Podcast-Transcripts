so if you got anything to tell you got anything else first no these stories you know it's funny because even we're in base we never knew a lot of the details and so when I put the books together talk to other people like the oil drums story we learned about 40 years later that Lynn Black had done the similar thing with RTI the how after I left right in between these guys and it's just like a lot of history that comes out slowly like Doug has said was anyone tracking was anyone right down the history as it was happening was anyone taking the operational summaries and compiling them somewhere they were all destroyed that was when I left food by one of my jobs was to go through and make sure that all the drums had been no the ashes they'd burnt all the a lot of reports after action reports were all burnt and then as we pulled out of every FOB and closed down CCN and CCS and CCC we closed all the everything was destroyed there's very few after action reports so with there are is just miniscule reports people try to put them out on eBay but they're fake they're just isn't any and there are out there we haven't there reports of archives that were even now beginning to look into but at a recent reunion the guy came up to me and said hey you know if you've done your books I got to like to talk to you because my job when we closed contone was to destroy all the records as the first time I ever had like a direct intel report do not go to the northeast this is the Christmas day mission we were on top of that no and midnight talked about that was the one quiet area probably there's a problem but we're talking about it spider goes do not go to the northeast we have an intel report do not go there I'm going to like intel report that never happened before or after on a live mission we're on the ground and we didn't know what to help us but they were right we didn't you know the story we could extract is we're back in base a few days later him and public connect and it's going like well well you want to ground a Christmas and we found out that he had that intel report that was confirmed the one place we could have gone we shouldn't have our instincts are right it's me talking about how to overcome little interruptions in your game that you're trying to win so you can check that out we also have flipside canvas dot com my brother Dakota Meyer has that company and he's making visual artwork for your walls that you can hang up we also have on it dot com slash jocker you can get all kinds of cool stuff on there kettlebells, jump ropes, sandbags things that you can get stronger with I've also written a bunch of books if you want to support you can get some of the books way the Warrior Kid is a series of books I wrote there's three of them the most recent one is called where's where there's a will and that book is available right now and so is where it way the Warrior Kid one and way the Warrior Kid two which is subtitled marks mission Mikey in the Dragons the book for younger kids that I wrote so your kids can learn how to overcome fear the discipline goes for freedom field manual which is a manual about how to get after it a little questions that you have are answered if you want the audio version that it's on iTunes Amazon music Google Play other MP3 platforms and of course there's extreme ownership which is the first book I wrote with my brother Dave Babin and then we have a follow on book to that called the dichotomy of leadership and those books are both about leadership and how to lead people I have a leadership consultancy called echelon front and what we do is solve problems through leadership if you have problems in your company it is because you have problems with your leadership to go to echelon front dot com if you want us to come and help you solve those problems EF online this is leadership training online Lynn and I were down in the Nang already so we were running business he went down with with with RT Virginia with Guntherwald and so they went down and ran their business including the famous oil drum one and Lynn and I were doing our thing and then by April my time in country was getting close so Lynn had agreed to be to come to one zero we had a special mission we were supposed to go up to the Mughi up past we brought Doug in Max Forron and Barry and an officer to go with us on that mission we trained for the mission trained right up to it went to the launch site on the choppers took off and they called us back and because two aircraft were shot down over the target area that day and so I was about four or five days from D-Rosing we went back to the camp they prism up the marble mountain We we talk almost every day and because we can we're alive and we try now to spread the story since we've been declassified like you're helping tremendously to spread this story to let people know that we actually there was a secret war going on and we were actually taking the war to the enemy because our country had signed a treaty saying that we would not go into North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia or the DMZ which we operated in every day right we weren't stationed here we just flew in by helicopters people always ask me well how long did you fight in South Vietnam and you know try to tell me try to give me quotes when he'd come back from a meeting with Bardswell he said bar old man said this no man said that you know he he was just at my house not too long before that and and my train room I've got trains Lionel and he was there had a great time but there were roommates for a few months and so the side note to the whole mission is I don't know how many we killed but it was not a good day for them but that age in orange was the only time I was ever near it and right now I've got stage four cancer from age in orange with a limited amount of time left so that's why I'm glad I'm here to tell a few stories glad you're here too they're born the um so how many tours did you do was that one tour I signed up for what I volunteered to go in special forces when I was regular I mean I volunteered regular so I appreciate you know that because as you know I don't have any like regular whatever they're called advertisements on here because I'm not gonna interrupt someone like tilt or someone like the Frenchmen or someone like BTF Tony or someone like Dakota Meyer and I always say that leadership is not an an inauguration you can't get one shot of it and then you know everything it's like going to one you just too class and thinking you know how to choke people out now no you have to train continually that's where EF online is for it's online interactive training EF online dot com we got the muster events these are leadership conferences, musters, gatherings where we deep dive and get granular on the pragmatic tools we have for leading people the next one we're doing is in September September 19th Like your first mission, you got the dog tracking you, you got the NVA encampment down below, you got the women's voices, you got the tracker coming up behind the dog. I think right now they've all sold out that one will sell out as well and then December 4th and 5th in Sydney Australia who knows when we're going back to Sydney but we're going this time so if you want to come to the muster check out extremownership dot com and then EF over watch EF over watch dot com what we're doing there is taking proven spec ops leaders proven combat aviation leaders and placing them into companies in the civilian sector that need leadership so if you need leadership in your organization go to efoverwatch dot com and if you want to give me some feedback on this podcast or you have a question or you have an answer or whatever for me I want Twitter Instagram and Facebook at jacqua willink but we just thought that we didn't know anybody way I didn't know anybody went to and then all of a sudden the internet came about I typed in SF one time and a couple emails came up old ones I typed in and a mclusky got he was working as a metavac pilot and he was the same Elden that we met in 68 as the same Elden went to the reunion with last year he was there in his respect and glory and you know that's the way we respected him like my son got wounded and in Iraq he went and saw this care at the hospital picked up for him right away they couldn't believe a two-star general one can do something but just that it saved the team was walking into an L shape ambush that they've been slaughtered and they were pushing them that way with trackers gunfire and everything else and so they just just like you say the gods were always with us sometimes but at that very next day I'm still on the trail where we were assigned that was the trail for my very first mission we got into North Vietnam into it called nickel steel and I'm been laying there for four days through this process and Gunther was I you know and I got to say this right after we got done of course we did some more talking and the Frenchmen was was explaining the fact that when he would go out on a mission every mission he would go out on he would square away his footwalker make sure everything was ready to be shipped home because every time he went out he figured he would not be coming back so real heroes so if you do want to help out which like I said that's that's what allows us to be able to do this that's what allows me to able to fly the Frenchmen out here to sit down and and talk and tell his story and so it's because of you all out there supporting supporting my companies or my books or whatever so it's appreciated so if you want to if you do want to help out you want to support the podcast then you can check out originmain.com where we have geese for jiu jitsu we have rashguards we have clothing of all whatever sorts including jeans and we got supplements up there people used to ask me what supplements I take I take the supplements that I make so join warfare criminal discipline discipline go and I drink milk because it's awesome and delicious and of course jockel white tea but we finally got extraction orders and they came and got us and strung us out and when we were on strings it went off and the cubby writer was there and it was like an atom bomb it was a miniature mushroom and the shockwave even though we were miles away came through us on strings and the choppers and just like this well you got home how long did it take to kind of adapt to the civilian life it took about a year that because I slept with my car 15 and then when I was in training group I always had all the weapons around me I felt safe but you know fourth of July it was always a hard one with stuff going on you don't know So the mission of 68 is where I got the skip from the blow-up radio that let him know he was walking into an act letting tilting know that he was walking into an ambush and I'm laying on a trail with the radio on and heard this my interpreter comes up and interprets what's going on. what's he doing now he's up at doing heavy equipment training up in the long beach him and Bruno his faithful companions are there doing it and just kicking ass taken there so pretty soon hub on the licenses in place and if you need any heavy equipment work give him a call right on and the freshman will build a house for you and what about so you got you got married when you got done and I'll tell you the amount of feedback I've gotten from you came on till that mean it's been overwhelming the number of people that just you know thank you for your service they're gonna pass the same thing on to you you know you guys should know that America loves you guys for what you did for this country so I can say you know hey buy this or buy that or whatever you know I'm not gonna stop reading colder than hell or I'm not gonna stop reading the forgotten highlander I'm not gonna stop reading one soldiers war so that I can you know mention a product or something like that so to me that's not what this podcast is about the information and he was crazy because he had salty went and went forward and did from RT Idaho and that team and Lynn was like, man, I don't even know how we got out of there. and it's incredible the sacrifices that those operators made in that time especially and obviously the ones that did not come home and to the rest of you that have served or you are serving thank you for keeping us safe from today's threats which are vast and equally evil it is you that keeps us secure and keeps our way of life secure and to our police and law enforcement to the firefighters out there to the paramedics EMTs dispatchers correctional officers boarder patrol secret service and all other first responders you are on call every day you are waiting when we need help you are there so thank you for keeping us safe and to everyone else out there remember what the Frenchman said after his kernel god done explaining the treacherous situation that they were set to go into when that kernel asks if anyone had any questions the Frenchman replied where do you need help where do you need help it's a simple question my mom loved every one of Bubba Bubba came to LA and said I need a bunk up for a couple days six and half months later he'd gone through the LAPD and six and half months later he even got married brought his wife into the house by mom and dad finally said enough enough Bubba for your wedding present we're giving you an apartment but any saga was welcome to my mom and dad's house I went back to the Garden State and then he went back to California and separate ways and we did we had the cards and some notes I don't think my phone calls and it just let us back if we had a couple of guys I had other people I stayed in contact with and then I just figured he got a job with a CIA or just something somewhere else you know Like he looked up at me like this and was smiling and he dropped the WP right on top of them and there was crispy critters running everywhere and we got out of there and got back but we had a confirmation from the intel report and it was just amazing you know it's just like to this day they got out of it and due to other factors they got out of it but he's in training group so technically he got out of the army after I did like I got out in April you got out in June and July September first September first Yeah, yeah, the once he got that, once he got the radio back for you to start working, children screams into the radio, we need an ex-filled now, I'm declaring Perry Fire Emergency is anyone out there. And like the attitude towards the Vietnam war in 1967, you know, from the, I mean, when we think of Hollywood now, we think of people that just are, you know, just detest everything it has to do with the military most of the time. and they're I'm sure they're I'm sure you're here and from them till I know you've been transferring some of the messages to me what's your what's the Twitter that you're actually looking at right now because you have a couple you have non-saga of sog chronicles you know which one it is my daughter set there's one is Jay strike or my initial Jay and this strike or mine I haven't I've fallen out of the Twitter thing you've bonded me to this is so Instagram Instagram is what you're doing a little bit of social media over here So I was one of those real, just a really tight one but like Doug says in a way when you know, and retrospect like, I just another day in the sag but that wouldn't really stuck. Check out Warrior Kid soap from young aiden who's making soap on his farm up in Central California that's an Irish oak branch dot com there's a YouTube channel that's called jockel podcast and that's where we have the videos of this so if you want to see what the Frenchman looks like or you want to see what tilt looks like you can check out the YouTube channel there's also little shortened excerpts of this podcast. and she did on 11 11 11 and my guys came and watched I had seven of my saggers come to that and watch till came everybody flew there we were there for witness and even here we found one to many to had pulled that this just string up from the shrapnel as an eyewitness that's that was a key thing we got the CEO to do a letter but took a while to track it down put it together and it's awesome to be able to sit here and talk to those guys and what a what an honor that is and anyways you know actually one of the reasons that I can sit here and talk to guys like tilt and the Frenchmen is because of all the support that comes in from all of you Children's move the team toward the first mountain movement was slowed by tall elephant grass and the only communication between the team members was hand signals the team moved in ten minute intervals stopping every ten minutes to listen to what was going on around it. and I just never miss it because I don't know who's gonna die just like yesterday was our interpreter perhaps two year anniversary of his death and most everybody's going down with age orange of some kind of cancer and stuff and it took six years until Diane black my congresswoman called me one day I was coming back from Arlington from Barry and Guntherwald and and my Virginia team Donnie shoe and and Bill Brown William Brown and she calls me on the phone on I don't even know who she is she says are you Doug maternal the Frenchman I talked about this with tilt as well, like the determination of them where you think of the insurgents, insurgent army, you know, their rule is like, hey, we don't need to fight. and I went back home and became a weapons instructor for special forces training group and got out so how many years was the total three three years three years that was it and I was pretty good because not after that period of time you know we'd never talked to each other we weren't allowed to talk about it for 20 years as what I was told so I never ever talked to anybody I never met anybody until 2000 did you guys I managed to get a whole to spider parks he just happened to be going by for a radio check and I told him what's going on he radios to to tilt to turn around and go back that he had intel and tilt's going And then one thing led to another, I got into college and I got on the college intercollegiate team and we traveled and rodeoed. and then what you do when you when you got out I kind of went back to rodeo and training horses and things like that He says, I don't know how many holes you got, but this one here needs attention right now and it's huge.
