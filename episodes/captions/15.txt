[00:00:00] This is Jocco podcast number 15 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
[00:00:08] Good evening, echo.
[00:00:10] Good evening.
[00:00:15] I looked around at the men.
[00:00:19] I was the only one looking around.
[00:00:23] All the other heads were bowed down, all of them praying.
[00:00:33] These men were going into battle, real battle.
[00:00:37] We could literally hear machine gun fire in the distance where the battle would take place.
[00:00:42] These men had suffered an incredible number of casualties.
[00:00:47] They had every reason to pray.
[00:00:52] I was with Charlie Company.
[00:00:57] From one of the most hallowed units in the US military, the first in the 506, the band
[00:01:02] of brothers made famous by their unbelievable performance in World War II, which was documented
[00:01:08] in the book, Band of Brothers, which became an HBO mini series of the same name.
[00:01:16] The first of the 506 and Ramadi held the line on that tradition of glory and service and courage.
[00:01:25] There's nothing I can say that we'll do justice to the admiration and the respect that I had
[00:01:34] for the first of the 506 and that all of a seals had for the first of the 506.
[00:01:43] The seals that I sent to work directly with the 506, they became adopted by the 506,
[00:01:52] red curhy, that's one of the nicknames for the 506.
[00:01:59] The seals that were directly there, working with them absolutely loved the 506.
[00:02:04] The 506 represented everything good I can imagine in a military team or any team, professional
[00:02:14] and discipline and motivated and creative.
[00:02:20] The leadership in the battalion was absolutely outstanding.
[00:02:28] The battalion commander, he was the very essence of leadership, he was calm and direct
[00:02:35] and friendly and open-minded and respectful and respected.
[00:02:44] His staff and the company commanders and the senior NCOs, they had this unified thread
[00:02:51] between them, this bond, this connection.
[00:02:56] It was that tradition and that sense of purpose and that standard of excellence and professionalism.
[00:03:03] It's hard to describe, but it was absolutely there and it was as real as the sand
[00:03:12] and the bullets and the guns.
[00:03:18] There I was and this was early in my deployment to Romadi with tasked and bruiser.
[00:03:23] I was about to go out into the Malab district with Charlie Company and their company
[00:03:30] commander was just an outstanding guy.
[00:03:37] And I knew that this unit and this company and this battalion, I knew was something special
[00:03:42] and I knew that that term, the band of brothers, I knew that that's what they truly were.
[00:03:53] When we hear it and I know it's a book and it's a HBO series but where does it come from?
[00:04:01] Now most people have heard that simple quote.
[00:04:06] We few, we happy few, we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall
[00:04:13] be my brother.
[00:04:20] I knew what that quote was.
[00:04:22] I knew where it came from.
[00:04:24] I was an English major in college and I knew that that was Shakespeare and I knew that
[00:04:30] that was Henry the Fifth and I knew how powerful that quote was.
[00:04:42] Now when you start talking about Shakespeare and you start talking about Henry the Fifth,
[00:04:47] there's all kinds of different directions you can go because you can go back and you
[00:04:51] can look at what Henry the Fifth was like in real life and if you was like the leader
[00:04:57] that Shakespeare made him into in the play and you could talk about Shakespeare himself
[00:05:02] and the rumors and the myths and the legends that circulate his life and his legacy
[00:05:09] because there's all kinds of questions about Shakespeare.
[00:05:13] I mean did he actually write all of his plays?
[00:05:17] Was he more than one person?
[00:05:19] Was he a soldier at some point?
[00:05:20] How did he know all this stuff about the military and what it was like to be a soldier?
[00:05:27] Was his vocabulary ten times what a normal person is?
[00:05:31] There's all kinds of like I said, rumor and myth about Shakespeare.
[00:05:40] And instead of talking about all that and the conjecture and the hypothetical questions
[00:05:46] I would rather talk about something that is known, something that we have today and those
[00:05:56] are the words.
[00:06:02] Words from the play Henry the Fifth which yes was written by Shakespeare and I'm going
[00:06:09] to tell you don't be scared and don't be intimidated by that.
[00:06:14] I mean don't be scared and don't be intimidated by Shakespeare because you don't understand
[00:06:21] it because you can't.
[00:06:24] And the fact of the matter is no one can at least at first it's not possible to understand
[00:06:34] Shakespeare out of the gate.
[00:06:36] It doesn't work.
[00:06:38] It's another language.
[00:06:40] It is another language.
[00:06:43] You can't be expected to understand it.
[00:06:45] It's written in something called Early Modern English.
[00:06:50] We speak English.
[00:06:51] This is Early Modern English which is just a transition from something called Middle English.
[00:06:57] And if you go on YouTube and you look up Middle English and you have somebody read a real
[00:07:03] common one.
[00:07:04] It's a lower prayer in Middle English. you can barely understand it.
[00:07:08] Parts of it you can't understand parts of the word you recognize.
[00:07:13] But when you get to Early Modern English now it's a step closer but it's still there's
[00:07:19] different it's a different type of language and there's archaic words and there's obsolete
[00:07:24] words and there's words that Shakespeare just made up he would make up words.
[00:07:29] And it's actually in the patterns of speech or different in the idioms or different and the references
[00:07:35] are all historical and so if you don't have a grasp on those mythological references
[00:07:42] and historical references and biblical references then it doesn't have the meaning that
[00:07:46] it's supposed to have.
[00:07:47] So you can't expect just to open up Shakespeare and be able to understand it.
[00:07:54] Now this is actually the opposite of what I often say because to me you hear me say
[00:07:58] all the time that what makes English so important is that you can make things very simple
[00:08:03] and very understandable by everybody so then why is it important?
[00:08:07] Why should we read it?
[00:08:08] Why should we try and understand it?
[00:08:13] And the answer that question is actually very simple.
[00:08:21] Shakespeare had something.
[00:08:27] He had something.
[00:08:28] He had some understanding, some knowledge, some insight into the human mind that is not
[00:08:38] normal.
[00:08:40] It's not normal.
[00:08:41] He understood people deeply.
[00:08:48] He understood relationships, he understood leadership, he understood love and he understood
[00:08:53] war and I don't know how he did this and I know why he did.
[00:08:57] And on top of that he had this talent he had this gift to translate that knowledge into
[00:09:06] words.
[00:09:10] And this is important because in the late 1500s and the early 1600s this is a whole
[00:09:17] another deal.
[00:09:18] There's no special effects.
[00:09:19] There's no close-up shots of an actor.
[00:09:22] There's no stunt man.
[00:09:23] There's no CGI.
[00:09:27] Everything has to be contained in the words, all the emotion and all the feeling and
[00:09:33] all the action and all the nature of human beings.
[00:09:38] It all has to be captured in the words.
[00:09:45] And the words that Shakespeare uses are heavy.
[00:09:51] And they're also their parragnant, their parragnant with so much more meaning than
[00:09:57] what's on the surface.
[00:09:59] They're filled with depth and knowledge that you have to scrape away and uncover to figure
[00:10:09] out what they're even talking about.
[00:10:16] But let's take a look at this.
[00:10:20] This famous speech in Henry V.
[00:10:25] The play of the same name.
[00:10:29] And I'm going to lead into it a little bit just to kind of at least set the context of
[00:10:36] what's happening.
[00:10:37] And as I went into my notes, just the opening when you've got this guy that kind of
[00:10:44] comes out and describes to you what's going to happen in the play.
[00:10:50] And he kind of introduces Henry, they call him Harry.
[00:10:56] Any introduces him with this line.
[00:11:02] Then should the warlike Harry like himself assume the port of Mars and at his heels
[00:11:11] leashed in like hounds should famine, sword and fire, crouch for employment.
[00:11:23] So if you break that down, first of all he's coming out of the gate, he's saying Harry
[00:11:28] is warlike, which means he's fond of war and skilled in it and equipped for it.
[00:11:38] And in a more literal meeting it's saying Henry is like war himself, which means he has
[00:11:46] complexities and the youth and the mayhem and the chaos inside himself.
[00:11:53] And then it goes on to say that he should assume the port of Mars, which means he should
[00:12:00] take on the bearing of Mars, which is the Roman god of war.
[00:12:05] That is heels, so down now by his feet leashed in like hounds.
[00:12:10] So you've got dogs, angry dogs, on leashes and those dogs are famine, sword and fire.
[00:12:20] And in those days that was war.
[00:12:24] Because when you did siege warfare on somebody and you locked down their castle, you starved
[00:12:29] them.
[00:12:30] Once they were weakened, you burned their castle and then used the sword to finish them
[00:12:35] off.
[00:12:36] So he had those dogs of war at his side and they were crouched for employment.
[00:12:43] If you can imagine a pit bull just tense and coiled like a spring ready to pounce.
[00:12:53] That's the opening to describe Henry.
[00:13:01] So they're at war with France and they go to take down this town of Harflur.
[00:13:17] And at this point this is one of the other really famous speeches from Henry the fifth.
[00:13:22] And at this point they've broken through the walls and there's a breach in the wall.
[00:13:28] So there's a hole in the wall.
[00:13:30] But the French are still defending it.
[00:13:33] The French are still defending it pretty well.
[00:13:35] And so Henry has a little chat with his troopers.
[00:13:37] And this is a pretty famous speech.
[00:13:40] And he says once more unto the breach dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with
[00:13:47] our English dead.
[00:13:50] So he's saying that hole in the wall, charge it, charge it and either get through it
[00:13:55] or fill up the wall with our dead.
[00:14:01] And then he says in peace there's nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility.
[00:14:09] So when things are when things are peaceful, being calm and being humble is a good thing.
[00:14:17] But when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger.
[00:14:26] So when war comes, never mind peace and calm.
[00:14:28] It's time to be like a tiger.
[00:14:30] And he says stiff in the sinews, summon up the blood to sky's fair nature with hard
[00:14:36] favored rage.
[00:14:42] So tense your body and summon up your rage.
[00:14:49] Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.
[00:14:53] Let pride through the portage of the head like the brass cannon.
[00:14:58] Let the brow overwhelm it.
[00:15:01] So what you say in there is, throw your brow and let your eye poke through your brow like
[00:15:09] a cannon.
[00:15:11] Like a brass cannon sticking out of a port hole.
[00:15:17] As furfully as Dotha gollid rock overhang and juddy his confounded based swilled with the
[00:15:25] wild and wasteful ocean.
[00:15:27] So he's saying make your brow overhang your eyes like a rock that druts out over the wild
[00:15:32] ocean.
[00:15:36] And then now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, hold hard the breath and bend
[00:15:43] up every spirit till its full height.
[00:15:46] So you know what that one is, bite down, grit your teeth, flare your nostrils, take
[00:15:53] a deep breath and hold it in and bring every emotion you have to its utmost.
[00:15:59] And like like a tension on a bow on on unenobless English whose blood is fed from fathers
[00:16:11] of war proof, fathers like so many Alexander's having these parts from more until even
[00:16:20] fought and sheed their swords for lack of argument.
[00:16:25] So he's saying listen.
[00:16:28] You got to fight.
[00:16:30] You got to fight.
[00:16:31] You English men whose blood is from combat tested warriors like Alexander the Great.
[00:16:41] And those men have fought on this soil from morning until night forever and they only
[00:16:47] sheed their swords when there was no one else to fight.
[00:16:55] Do not dishonor your mothers.
[00:16:57] Now a test that whom you called fathers did begot you.
[00:17:01] So don't dishonor your mom.
[00:17:05] Prove that your father with his warrior blood is really your father.
[00:17:12] Be copy now to men of grosser blood and teach them how to war.
[00:17:20] That means being example to the lesser man to the weaker man and show them how to war.
[00:17:26] And you good young men whose limbs were made in England show us here the metal of your
[00:17:36] pasture.
[00:17:38] So young men were basically like the troopers, the foot soldiers and the archers and he
[00:17:43] saying show us how you were born in England and the pasture.
[00:17:49] That's where you were raised like a cow was raised on a pasture.
[00:17:52] Show us what the metal of that pasture is.
[00:17:55] Let us swear that you are worth your breeding which I doubt not.
[00:18:02] For there is none of you so mean and base that have not noble luster in your eyes.
[00:18:10] So no matter where these guys are from, no matter what level of society they came from.
[00:18:16] He sees the noble luster and the righteous gleam in their eyes.
[00:18:24] I see you stand like gray hounds in the slips straining upon the start.
[00:18:33] Now gray hounds, you know, now we're using for racing, they used to be used to hunt to
[00:18:39] run down animals and a slip.
[00:18:44] And this is one of those things you got to look this up.
[00:18:46] I didn't know this.
[00:18:47] I looked it up today.
[00:18:49] A slip is an old kind of leech that they used for hunting dogs that when you, it was
[00:18:55] very, you could, you could basically hit a switch and it would let the dog go.
[00:19:00] So here are these picture these gray hounds that are in these quick release leaches,
[00:19:04] but they're straining on them, waiting to go on the hunt to go and chase down their prey.
[00:19:11] And the next line is the games of foot follow your spirit and upon this charge, cry,
[00:19:18] God for Harry, England and St. George.
[00:19:21] So he says the game is a foot meaning the animal that you're hunting, it's out there.
[00:19:28] Follow your spirit and then go and get after it and as you get after it, yell God for
[00:19:38] Harry, England and St. George and St. George is the patron saint of England, the dragon
[00:19:44] and slayer who was an executed Christian murder.
[00:19:52] So you can see that there's so much inside these words and he captures some of the brutality
[00:20:05] of war.
[00:20:07] And so what happens now is they get the village that they're trying to take down and
[00:20:13] they've put a lot of pressure on, they've gone through the breach, they've gotten
[00:20:17] foot back, but now they've gone along a lock down and he's telling them, he tells the
[00:20:29] governor that he needs to surrender before Henry loses control of his own men.
[00:20:41] This is a scary thing, this is like, hey, if you don't surrender now, I'm not going to
[00:20:45] have control anymore over these guys.
[00:20:47] These barbarians at the gate, they're going to come and I'm not going to have control over
[00:20:51] them anymore.
[00:20:53] He says the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier, rough and hard
[00:21:02] of heart and by the way, fleshed.
[00:21:04] This is an old word, it means excited by the taste of flesh.
[00:21:09] So he's saying these soldiers who are excited by the taste of flesh in liberty of bloody
[00:21:16] hand shall range with conscience wide as hell.
[00:21:22] So in liberty of bloody hand, you know what that means?
[00:21:25] It means our hands are already covered in blood.
[00:21:27] I'm just going to go forward, I don't care anymore.
[00:21:31] I don't care anymore.
[00:21:35] The conscious wide is hell, mowing like grass, your fresh fair virgins and your flowering
[00:21:43] infants.
[00:21:46] So we are going to come and we are going to mow like grass.
[00:21:55] Your virgins and your children.
[00:21:56] That's that, it's right.
[00:21:59] He goes on trying to convince them.
[00:22:02] Again, this is his key point is like, listen, I've control these guys right now.
[00:22:07] And he goes on.
[00:22:08] Therefore, you men of harfler take pity on your town and of your people.
[00:22:14] Whilst yet my soldiers are in my command, whilst yet the cool and temperate's wind of grace
[00:22:23] all blows the filthy and contagious clouds of heavy, murder, spoil and villainy.
[00:22:33] So he's saying like, right now there's a cool breeze of peace and grace with my guys,
[00:22:39] but some contagious clouds are coming of murder and spoil and villainy.
[00:22:47] And the word to use is heavy is it means intoxicating.
[00:22:51] Meaning these guys are going to lose their minds.
[00:22:57] If not, why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand, desire
[00:23:06] the locks of your shrivel, shrieking daughters.
[00:23:10] Your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dash to the walls.
[00:23:20] And he's saying, I'm blind and bloody soldier, and I'm blind with rage and blind with
[00:23:24] murder and foul handsies telling them this.
[00:23:30] Your naked infants spitted upon pikes and spitted by the way is a methodology used in this
[00:23:45] time period for cooking small games, small animals and it means you put the animal on a pole
[00:23:50] from mouth to rectum and he's saying they're going to do this to their children.
[00:23:59] Wals the mad mothers with their house confused to break the clouds as did the wives of
[00:24:07] Juliet at herds bloody hunting slaughtermen. So break the clouds. That means cries so the mad
[00:24:15] mothers are going to go mad with tears.
[00:24:20] Like they did in the Bible in Matthew 216, that's what this is referring to when King
[00:24:25] Herred ordered the slaughter of all boys under the age of two and Bethlehem.
[00:24:32] This is like a threat that they're going to kill all the children.
[00:24:36] So Henry the fifth is bringing it.
[00:24:40] What say you?
[00:24:43] Will you yield and of this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed?
[00:24:53] So the French hearing these pretty valid threats coming.
[00:25:01] They surrender. Henry and the troops take that village and then the next thing they do
[00:25:09] is march and again, moving rapidly through a real war that took place.
[00:25:16] And they end up settling on the opposing ends of a field which is now what becomes the
[00:25:24] famous battle of some people call as in court or as in court.
[00:25:31] And the French, they got more people.
[00:25:37] I mean it's in France. So they've got more people substantially more people and there's
[00:25:43] a bunch of different, you know, the books I've read, there's varying numbers, but they definitely
[00:25:47] had substantially more people. And Henry, he's talking to some of his leadership, his
[00:25:56] subordinate commanders and then they all kind of walk off the stage and he's left there
[00:26:02] and he starts talking a little bit about the burden of command and some thoughts on leadership
[00:26:07] which I was I found very familiar.
[00:26:14] So he says, upon the king, let us our lives, our souls, our debts, our careful wives, our
[00:26:23] children and our sins lay on the king. We must bear all.
[00:26:32] So he knows that the king is responsible for everything.
[00:26:35] Got to take ownership of everything. And he kind of talks about this idea that the king is,
[00:26:49] you know, it's the expression of it's lonely at the top. He's about to get into that.
[00:26:55] And whatever it was, 15, 99.
[00:26:58] Oh, ceremony, show me but I worth. What is that soul of adoration? Art thou ought else but
[00:27:06] place degree and form? So he's saying like, what is all this junk besides just social
[00:27:12] rank and etiquette? What real meaning does it have? Creating awe and fear in other men,
[00:27:19] where in thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing? So he's saying, look,
[00:27:26] like these people are scared of me. I'm I'm actually less happy than they are. They're afraid
[00:27:32] of me, but I'm less happy because I'm the guy that's scaring them. I am a king that find the
[00:27:40] and I know, it is not the bomb, the septer and the ball, the sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
[00:27:48] the inter-tissued robe of gold and pearl, the first title running for the king.
[00:27:54] The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world. So
[00:28:01] he goes through all the kind of stereotypical things that make you a king. You know, the clothes,
[00:28:07] the septer, the crown, all those things. No, not all these, thrice, gorgeous ceremony, not all
[00:28:17] these, laid in bed majestical. So not any of those beautiful things, expensive things,
[00:28:25] can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave. So it's the slave who, with a body filled and vacant mind,
[00:28:38] gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread. So he's talking about this fact that the king
[00:28:50] doesn't get to rest, doesn't get to sleep when the slave goes home at night. He's going to eat
[00:28:54] the fed and distressful basically that means that they made it themselves. They made it with
[00:28:57] their own hands. They actually get some satisfaction of making their food and eating it.
[00:29:02] He's even get that satisfaction. His mind is constantly churning about the fate of the
[00:29:07] kingdom. And it's actually, interestingly, when I was in, I know we did a podcast here about Sri Lanka,
[00:29:14] and I talked about me being in Sri Lanka. And I tried to drag it because again, I'd never been in
[00:29:19] combat. This is the mid-90s. And I tried to drag as much knowledge as I could out of the Sri
[00:29:25] Lankan guys, the Sri Lankan military, the Sri Lankan special boat service and the special forces
[00:29:31] guys that we were working with and they were unbelievably combat experienced veterans.
[00:29:36] But one of the guys that I befriended who is an army captain and his, he was one of those guys who
[00:29:45] is a guy that was a good leader. But man, he felt exactly what this guy, what Henry the fifth is talking
[00:29:52] about here. And I remember him saying, you know, he's kind of just having a late night conversation
[00:29:57] with me because like I said, I was constantly trying to garner information from these guys and
[00:30:02] learn from them. And you know, he, because this guy had been at this guy had been a regular soldier.
[00:30:08] And then he had been promoted, he'd gone up the ranks. And he said, you know, Jarko,
[00:30:13] when I was a soldier, meaning when he was just a grunt soldier, I'm, you know, lower and
[00:30:19] listed guy, he said, I knew I could survive anything. And I knew I could take care of myself.
[00:30:25] And it was actually kind of fun. And he said, now that I'm a company commander because now he
[00:30:33] was actually pretty senior guy, he said, it is the most stress and it is the most harrowing thing,
[00:30:41] because I'm not worried about myself anymore. But I'm so worried about all these other guys.
[00:30:46] That's what the worry is. And yeah, I actually got to know that feeling myself. The leader gets
[00:30:58] no rest and what Henry's talking about is that burden of command. And that's the same thing that
[00:31:02] Sri Lanka guy was talking about. You hear me talking about it as well. You know, that burden of
[00:31:07] command is heavy. And now, so now, you know, again, I've kind of gone very quickly through
[00:31:19] what this to get to this point where where Henry the fifth makes this famous speech. And as I
[00:31:26] said, the English are on one side of the battlefield in the French. The other, again, this really happened.
[00:31:29] This is this is factual information. And they can hear each other and they can at night, they see
[00:31:36] each other's campfire burning and the English, like I said, they know they're outnumbered. And finally,
[00:31:42] one of the leaders, you know, as they're as they're getting ready to go and come about one of the
[00:31:46] leaders from the British side, he calls out kind of like wishing that they add more men. And it's
[00:31:53] interesting and it's pretty important to know that, I mean, obviously Shakespeare fictionalized
[00:32:00] this in many ways, but that speech is actually rooted in a real account. It's rooted in a real account
[00:32:08] of something that was said. And, and the account was written by an anonymous chaplain that was like
[00:32:16] on tour with these guys. And he just wrote down what he saw. And in his report, it was the a guy named
[00:32:23] Sir Walter Hungerford that suggested to the king that it would be nice if they had another
[00:32:29] 10,000 archers from England that were not doing anything, you know, that are sitting back,
[00:32:33] doing, you know, back in England, sitting in peace and it'd be nice if they had them there.
[00:32:38] But now in the play, it's a character named Westmoreland, who's one of, you know, the, the
[00:32:43] lieutenant's or the one of the subordinate leadership of Henry V. And he says, oh, that we now had here,
[00:32:52] but one 10,000 of those men in England that do know work today. So he's saying that same thing,
[00:33:00] he's like, listen, here we are about to go to battle, work completely outnumbered and
[00:33:09] be nice if we had some of those other guys that are in England right now that are sitting in bed
[00:33:12] they're doing nothing. And so, so now King Henry responds. And again, this is this is in the same
[00:33:20] vein that was documented by this synonymous chaplain. And of course, Shakespeare wrote it,
[00:33:25] so it's got to be, it's a lot more impactful, but the message is the same. And I'm going to go through
[00:33:31] this once and kind of break it down. So so that we can understand what the meaning of these different
[00:33:37] words are before I just roll through it. So when he said, you know, this guy says, you know,
[00:33:44] if only we had more guys. And King Henry says, what's he that wishes? So meaning who just said that?
[00:33:54] Said, my cousin West Moorland, know my fair cousin. If we are marked to die, we are enough to do
[00:34:02] our country loss. And if to live the fewer men, the greater share of honor. So we say, no,
[00:34:12] listen, if we're going to die, we got plenty of guys here to die for our country. But if we're
[00:34:18] going to live and if we're going to win, the fewer men we have, the better, because that's more
[00:34:23] honor for us. God's will, I pray the wish not one more man is one anybody else. By Jov, I am not
[00:34:37] covetous for gold nor care I who defeat upon my cost. So he doesn't care about gold. He doesn't care
[00:34:44] who he feeds and who eats off of his check that he's cashin. It earns me not if my men, my garments
[00:34:53] wear, meaning he isn't people. He doesn't care if people are either taking his clothes or if they're
[00:34:58] wearing his real colors. It doesn't care about any of that. Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
[00:35:05] Those things don't matter to him. But if it, if it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most
[00:35:16] offending soul alive. So if it's about honor and if it's a sin to want honor and want glory,
[00:35:27] then he's the guiltyest person of them all. No faith, my cause, wish not a man from England.
[00:35:34] God's peace, I would not lose so great in honor as one more man. Me thinks would share from me
[00:35:42] for the best hope I have. Oh, do not wish one more. So he's just going off like no, we don't want
[00:35:49] anyone else. I don't want to share my honor with anyone else. Rather, proclaim it, Westmoreland,
[00:35:57] through my host that he which half know stomach to this fight let him depart. His passport shall
[00:36:06] be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse. So he's okay, you know what, Westmoreland?
[00:36:14] As a matter of fact, tell everyone that anybody that doesn't have the guts or the stomach to
[00:36:22] stand here with us and fight, tell them, I'll give them a passport and I'll give them money to pay
[00:36:31] for their trip home. We would not die in that man's company that theorist is fellowship to die with us.
[00:36:42] He's one of die with anybody that fears the duty, that's what they mean by fellowship,
[00:36:47] the duty to die with us. This day is called the Feast of Crispy and so Crispy and
[00:36:58] this is actually a legit twin brothers. Interestingly, Crispy and Crispy and Twin Brothers,
[00:37:06] they helped the poor and they preached Christianity and they were tortured by a Roman governor
[00:37:13] and they were thrown into the river with millstones tied around their necks and they survived
[00:37:20] and when they survived that they pulled them out of the water and they beheaded them.
[00:37:25] They were venerated and they became saints on October 25th and that's called St. Crispy and
[00:37:30] today, sometimes it's called St. Crispy and today, but that's what it is. So this day, this is October 25th
[00:37:38] when they're about to fight. He says this day is called the Feast of Crispy and he that out lives
[00:37:44] this day and comes home safe will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of
[00:37:52] Crispy and so anybody that anybody that lives through this day and comes home safe when it's going to
[00:37:57] be St. Crispy and today they're going to get on their toes they're going to be so excited about it.
[00:38:02] He that she'll see this day and live all day, he'll yearly on the video feast his neighbors and say
[00:38:12] tomorrow is Saint Crispy and so again anyway that lives through this is going to be going to
[00:38:17] their neighbors and say, tomorrow Saint Crispy and today then will he strip his sleeve and show
[00:38:26] his scars and say these wounds I had on Crispy's day. So he's going to be at their feast he's going
[00:38:34] to roll up his sleeves and he's going to say, you see these scars? These are what I got on Crispy's day.
[00:38:41] Old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages what feats he did that
[00:38:51] day so he's saying everything gets forgot right but the old man will remember the glory days of that
[00:38:58] battle and what he did it will be the highlight of his life.
[00:39:06] Then our names familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry the King, bedford and exeter,
[00:39:14] warric and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.
[00:39:23] So all their names are going to be remembered.
[00:39:29] This story shall the good man teaches son and Crispy and Crispy and shall narrow go by from this
[00:39:37] day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered.
[00:39:42] So we say, look, this is a story that good men are going to tell their sons and they're going
[00:39:51] for ever remember on this day to the ending of the world what we did.
[00:39:59] We few, we happy few, we band a brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
[00:40:07] And that one doesn't really need an explanation but we sure do hear about brotherhood a lot.
[00:40:22] Be he near so vile this day shall gentle his condition so no matter where you're from,
[00:40:29] no matter what you were like, no matter what kind of a person you were today when he says gentle
[00:40:35] his condition that today will make you a gentleman today will make you a man.
[00:40:43] And gentle men in England now are bed so guys that are back in England right now sleeping
[00:40:48] shall think themselves are cursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap whilst any
[00:40:56] speaks that fought with us upon St. Crispin's day. So like I said, anyone that's home in England
[00:41:05] and that word of bed it's like implies being lazy and sleeping they're going to curse that they
[00:41:11] weren't there and they'll know that they weren't real men and I mean he used the word manhood
[00:41:19] which implies you know, testicular fortitude they didn't have the testicular fortitude to fight
[00:41:26] and that's that's the speech with the understanding and I haven't even gone all the way.
[00:41:39] I mean I didn't go to break down each and every word and the depth and meaning behind them because
[00:41:45] they are so impactful. And if you go when you read you can get like a translated modern version
[00:41:59] that kind of dumps down the language and that's okay but I'm telling you having done both when you do that
[00:42:06] that's like compared to actually doing the work and studying and figuring out what it all actually
[00:42:14] means if you just take a dumb-down version it's like diet Shakespeare or Shakespeare right it's
[00:42:21] it's actually worse than that it's like firing a cap gun versus firing a real gun it kind of looks
[00:42:28] the same and it might even sound a little bit the same but one of them will kill you and the other
[00:42:33] one just goes bang you know it's not as heavy and what's really bizarre and this is I think
[00:42:40] actually this is really strange if you go on YouTube and you look up Henry the fifth
[00:42:52] St. Crispin's Day speech right if you look it up you'll get these classically trained actors
[00:42:58] famous I mean famous actors doing this speech and in my mind they don't get it they don't get it
[00:43:16] right and I you know what I know I'm a nobody I know I'm just some guy and these people
[00:43:22] a lot of people at study Shakespeare and did it on stage and all of a sudden I'm just an ignorant
[00:43:31] you know rich from the trenches and I don't understand I am a pentameter and all the other little
[00:43:34] details but I'm telling you I don't think they get it and when I watch the professionals do this
[00:43:44] I don't think they get the emotion I don't think they understand the leadership I don't think they
[00:43:49] get the fear and the blood and the death and I don't think they understand war
[00:44:00] and when these actors take these great words that are crafted brilliantly
[00:44:10] and they try and say them like leaders to me they still sound like actors they don't sound
[00:44:20] like men that have fathered and don't sound like men that have seen battle they definitely
[00:44:24] don't sound like men that have seen war I think Henry the fifth would have sounded different
[00:44:33] this is what I think would be closer to what Henry the fifth a combat leader would have sounded
[00:44:48] like as he as he answered some one of his subordinate leaders out there in the crowd saying
[00:44:56] that we need more people we need more men I think this is what he would have sounded like
[00:45:05] what's he that wishes so my cousin was moreland know my fair cousin if we are marked to die
[00:45:16] we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the few men the greater share of honor
[00:45:23] God's will I pray the wish not one more man by jove I am not covetous for gold nor
[00:45:35] cari who do our feet upon my cost it earns me not if men my garments wear such outward
[00:45:43] things to well not my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor I am the most defending soul
[00:45:55] alive no faith my cousin wish not a man from England God's peace I would not lose so great
[00:46:05] and honor as one man more me thinks would share for me for the best hope I have oh do not wish one more
[00:46:17] rather proclaim it west moreland for my host that he which has no stomach to this fight let
[00:46:25] him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy shall be put into his purse
[00:46:31] we would not die in that man's company that fears his fellowship to die with us
[00:46:44] this day is called the feast of crispy and leave that out lives this day and it comes home safe
[00:46:51] will stand a tiptoe when the day is named and rouse him at the name of crispy and
[00:46:57] he that shall see this day and live old age will yearly on the video feast his neighbors and say
[00:47:07] tomorrow is Saint Crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars and say these wounds
[00:47:16] I had on crispy and stay old men forget yet all shall be forgot but he'll remember with advantages
[00:47:31] what feats he did that day then shall our names familiar in his mouth as household words
[00:47:42] hairy the king bedford next to her warwick and talbot salsbury and claustar
[00:47:48] being there flowing cups freshly remembered
[00:47:55] this story shall the good man teaches son and crispy and crispy and shall narrow go by
[00:48:04] from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered
[00:48:09] we have a few we have a few we bend of brothers for who for he today that shed his blood with
[00:48:22] me shall be my brother be he near so vile this day shall gentle his condition
[00:48:32] and gentleman in England now a bed shall think themselves a curse that they were not here
[00:48:39] and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon Saint Crispian's day
[00:48:54] now that is a speech and that is like I said there's a lot more
[00:49:02] to it than what I covered there's so much depth there and that's why it's lasted the ages
[00:49:12] and that's why you hear people talking about brotherhood and this is what they refer to
[00:49:20] and as far as Shakespeare goes and I talk all the time about getting stronger and faster and getting
[00:49:27] smarter and stronger and faster that's I mean that's pretty straightforward how do you get
[00:49:39] stronger faster you let weights you work out you do your calisthenics you do physical
[00:49:45] activity to get stronger and faster but how do you get smarter well this is a one way to get
[00:49:53] smarter you go out and you find something that you do not understand and you gain understanding of it
[00:50:03] words you don't know and phrases you don't know and concepts you don't know you find them
[00:50:09] and you learn them you teach yourself the resources are there
[00:50:13] and by the way you know what it's free there's no gym fees there's no equipment to buy
[00:50:28] you can get all of Shakespeare his entire canon on the internet for free
[00:50:33] hmm it's at the library for free the only thing it does take and the only thing it does
[00:50:43] cost is just a little something that we call discipline right to get in there to open that book to
[00:50:48] challenge your brain in order to free your mind so that's Shakespeare that's Henry the fifth and
[00:51:05] very impactful and definitely a classic representation of the band of brothers that I had the honor
[00:51:16] to work with in Ramadi I rack in 2006 the first the five oh six and I guess it is time
[00:51:31] for questions from the interwebs and speaking of the interwebs
[00:51:39] those are from on it yes yeah we are in fact sponsored by on it dot com boom

[00:53:10] and you get 10% off boom get some shrimp tech sport but you always follow your the shrimp tech
[00:53:16] sport I think I think as a public service yeah if you're doing something that's high output like a
[00:53:22] crossfit situation you do that's a public service yeah I don't need you night in day anyway
[00:53:27] shrimp tech sport that's the one I'm gonna go on the shrimp tech sport I think I don't think
[00:53:31] see what's up and I didn't worry about the Amazon dot com yes if you would like to support this podcast
[00:53:40] in a painless way we'd call it painless yeah seamless seamless same painless quasi seamless
[00:53:47] instead of going straight to amazon dot com go to joccostore dot com or jocopotcast so from buy
[00:53:52] and tv you buy a flat screen last but tv for $800 right and you could do it through
[00:53:59] you do it through you click through jocopotcast dot com or joccostore dot com sure or joc was
[00:54:05] then in the podcast get supported financially yeah it gets like you know little some some
[00:54:11] yeah it's better than nothing yeah and it's yeah and actually Amazon pages because yeah that's cool
[00:54:19] because it takes time to do the podcast right it takes preparation to the podcast yeah and you
[00:54:25] don't want to be honest but I do it anyway yeah obviously I think you would too but what we did
[00:54:30] but people asked though they're like hey this is great but some people they'll they'll sign up
[00:54:33] something I guess other podcasts they'll have situations where you can sign up and just enter
[00:54:36] your credit card and it'll take out like a dollar a month or something as like a thing this guy
[00:54:41] I for totally forget his name such a cool way anyway even you told me that I was like dang that solid
[00:54:47] but nonetheless should we do that uh I don't know what to necessary but I don't know hey I think we're
[00:54:53] well maybe we'll research that yeah because I do people always say hey how can we support because people
[00:54:58] are getting value and when they give value they want to give value they want to give you something back
[00:55:03] which is awesome yeah I appreciate that very cool yeah I mean the prep notes today were 17
[00:55:09] pages long working on for the past few days getting ready you know that's like a turn paper in
[00:55:16] college you know those grinders total gut check yeah it's like a 400 level turn paper my turn
[00:55:23] paper is a one page yeah one page college athlete over there and oh yeah one more thing about
[00:55:30] about Amazon somebody hit me up on Twitter and said hey you need to say on your podcast that you
[00:55:35] have your your book extreme ownership is an audio book yeah and what what I think is cool about it is
[00:55:43] life who wrote the book with me he's another seal he worked with me in Ramadi and
[00:55:50] he and I are the ones that read it so we each wrote chapters we each wrote half the chapters and we

[00:56:08] eight hours long it's no joke if you had a long drive eight hour drive yeah get you got an eight hour
[00:56:14] driver's disco from send you yeah yeah that's one of those drives it's good okay yeah so jockelstore
[00:56:20] dot com jockelpodcast dot com alright in on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on it on the
[00:56:28] down for a few seconds thank you all right internet questions first question kind of the paragraph
[00:56:37] with the question yeah we got some long questions jockel i'm just curious about your opinions on the
[00:56:43] regular army infantry. It seems like nowadays the regular infantry is almost looked down upon
[00:56:50] from the regular public and every prior military public speaker. I almost feel like we're looked at
[00:56:57] like we were just bodies that held ground and absorbed attacks and made no real impact on the war.
[00:57:03] I'm almost hesitant to ask because I'm not sure if I can or I'm not sure if I'm in denial
[00:57:09] or if it's just pride. I served with some fantastic warriors and I don't want those heroes to be looked
[00:57:14] over in history because they were regular gruts. So I'd enjoy your opinions on this matter and if you
[00:57:21] could enlighten me on how infantry divisions are looked at from other groups and organizations.
[00:57:27] Yeah, this question, you know, it bothers me. It bothers me because if you couldn't tell
[00:57:42] from the opening that I did tonight, talk about the first of the 506, I would tell you the
[00:57:47] same thing about so many other units that we have the utmost respect and admiration for what we used to
[00:57:56] call conventional for forces with an alcohol general purpose forces, but it's the Marine Corps,
[00:58:01] the US Marine Corps, the US Army, they're regular infantry at a ground pattern, they're grunts.
[00:58:07] And we, like I said, the guys in my task, the guys in home to suit teams, we have nothing but
[00:58:16] respect and admiration for the ground pounders for the grunts. And for my position, you know,
[00:58:23] have been a Romani with the 228, which was a reserve unit offensive land unit iron soldiers.
[00:58:27] Those guys were outstanding, outstanding. And then they turned over with the 118 and you've
[00:58:33] heard me talk about them and the battalions that were attached to them. Those guys were just
[00:58:39] all of them. I mean, they were just so professional, so brave. And of course, special forces and
[00:58:46] seals and Rangers and Marsock and Afsock for whatever reason, special operations gets attention.
[00:58:54] I mean, the name is special operations. So it gets this attention. I'm not 100% sure where it comes
[00:59:01] from or where it's started or whatever, but there's something about the public and the media,
[00:59:08] and I don't know, the media feeds the public and the food, the public feeds the media,
[00:59:14] the media feeds the public. So like the public wants to see stories. So the media produces stories
[00:59:19] about the special operations types. And then it goes into a vision circle, a vicious circle,
[00:59:24] and they just make a bunch of new stories about it. And so, you know, it's like this little
[00:59:30] mistake or whatever of special operations, probably that's that's that's having that impact.
[00:59:37] But let me tell you, just for everybody, for anyone that's on that's not been in the military,
[00:59:42] that has that, you know, things, the special operations guys must be more, you know,
[00:59:46] elite or do more dangerous stuff wrong, wrong. Do they do dangerous stuff? Yes.
[00:59:54] But, you know, I've been all, and when I was in Iraq, my first diploma to Iraq went all over Iraq.
[01:00:00] It's spec second to diploma, stayed in the Romadi, but I, during that time saw the conventional
[01:00:06] units, the general purpose forces, the ground pounders, the grunts, the Marine Corps,
[01:00:10] and not just them, but I talked about this last time, the logistics folks, I mean,
[01:00:15] so it's everybody, they're out there, they're living in forward operating bases.
[01:00:18] They're living in combat outposts in the middle of cities, you know, small groups out there,
[01:00:23] eating MREs, just living in really tough conditions, doing daytime patrols and horrible
[01:00:30] areas, working with Iraqi soldiers. You know, like I just said, doing these logistics runs,
[01:00:36] you know, these are where you get blown up with an ID, these are where you get an ambushed. I mean,
[01:00:40] this is what they did all the time. Every day, this was their job, even like the mine clearance
[01:00:44] operations, you know, you're going out and you're going out to go and get blown up or try and
[01:00:50] look for things that are going to blow you up. And, you know, first, sure, you got some guys that
[01:00:54] are in the big, mind protected vehicles, but when we were in Romadi, there was a Marine Corps unit
[01:00:57] that would fall behind those guys sometimes in our meeting, they would fall behind those guys,
[01:01:00] they're just going to pray, and for tree guys, just out there, get an after it. And so,
[01:01:03] what do we think of that? I mean, I have just admiration, respect, and just utmost, the utmost,
[01:01:14] I hold those guys in the highest esteem because they held the line. So to that guy, the out there
[01:01:21] that asked that question, believe me, anybody that's been in combat and knows what you guys do.
[01:01:26] And I spread that word all the time, you listen to any, even if you read, if you read
[01:01:31] Lavinized book, I mean, we talked about that in great detail about the respect and admiration we had
[01:01:36] for for the general purpose forces, the grunts, the ground pounders, the bravest,
[01:01:42] the most professional and most dedicated people that I could ever imagine. And I was absolutely
[01:01:51] honored and everyone in my seal task unit was honored and humbled to have served with such
[01:01:58] brave warriors. So that's how I feel about our US military.
[01:02:09] Next question. So, Jockel posted a Twitter post, Instagram, Twitter and Instagram post
[01:02:19] of a picture black and white, strangely, and sort of a gig. Yeah, you think.
[01:02:25] Um, of just the mats and I think there's some ambiguous figures of his dean right
[01:02:31] teaching somebody. Anyway, he said, talked about he learned the lesson or something like that.
[01:02:37] Anyway, so the question is, Jockel, what lesson did you learn for the thousandth time?
[01:02:42] Because he said, he said that. It was. In training with dean the other day. So what was that?
[01:02:47] The lesson was rules, rules must sometimes be broken. So let me, let me give you the quick story
[01:02:53] for the philosophy that our Jitu players will indulge you a little bit with some Jitu. So Friday,
[01:03:01] night training, and dean, I usually train hard on Friday nights. And we had, uh, we had a war.
[01:03:07] We had a little death match on Friday. And it started off. We would have probably, I don't know,
[01:03:12] five, six, maybe seven minutes. And he got me, got me in a little, uh, got me in a little situation
[01:03:18] that forced me to submit. And then we, we also had a let's go again. And so we went again. And I,
[01:03:25] and I warmed down and I got the better of him. And actually, the, the deeper water I take him into,
[01:03:32] the better things get from me, right? So I warmed down and I got a hold of his arm.
[01:03:39] And I had him in a, I had him in a compromised position for probably five minutes. And,
[01:03:49] you know, he, and he at the last moments, good, great timing. And he just got out,
[01:03:56] Armbar. It was a straight arm walking. And, uh, so he got out and we got out. He was done. He was like,
[01:04:03] yeah, I'm done. I mean, he got out of it, but he was done. So Jocco got a little moral victory, right?
[01:04:08] And then I kind of antagonized him a little bit, which is what Dean and I do. We, we instigate and we
[01:04:14] antagonize each other. And so I antagonized him a little bit about, you know, you know, you don't want to
[01:04:18] train anymore. Oh, could you two, you're too broken down. You know, I'm going to stay here and train more.
[01:04:23] You can go home and, you know, have a glass of warm milk or whatever. You're going to just give him a hard time.
[01:04:28] So, so, you know, inside, and I failed to recognize us inside psychologically, he was, he was not happy
[01:04:35] about that. And so Saturday, he's like, hey, you know, let's train. And so I missed that. I missed that.
[01:04:43] It's a cue. That's a red flag. So when I showed up, you know, he says, oh, you know, let's just
[01:04:48] work some moves and we, we went over some stuff and working some other people. And, you know,
[01:04:53] we're just kind of very relaxed laid back. There was no class going on. We're just just relaxing.
[01:04:59] And I said, hey, man, I got to leave it such as such a time. I go pick one of my kids up. He
[01:05:03] goes, yeah, yeah, no problem. He goes, I got to leave too. So now I think he's got to leave. So I'm actually
[01:05:07] thinking, we're, we might get a light roll. That'll be it. You know, maybe like two, five minute rounds.
[01:05:12] So, and he's got the, you know, the nice guy phase and all that stuff that he's given me.
[01:05:18] So anyways, I said, you know, we work on stuff. And he says, all right, let's roll real quick.
[01:05:24] He even threw that out there. Like it was just going to be a quick roll quick. Yeah, just a quick roll.
[01:05:28] So I'm thinking, I'm thinking too much through. I'm literally I'm thinking too much through
[01:05:31] if you're meant to like to go over, maybe try some of the stuff we were just drilling a little bit.
[01:05:37] No, he comes full on. I mean, and it was the disguised full on. So he didn't, you know, get
[01:05:43] up. But he just went very sternly and, and passed my guard really quick. And then, and actually,
[01:05:51] you know, you and I were, had discussed this mountain escape that I had done to the other
[01:05:56] day. And I was actually like, I don't know, care if he mounts right now. I've got this new escape.
[01:05:59] And I'll just use that. And he aggressively mounted and he aggressively went for this move that we call
[01:06:06] the snow angel, which is when you get the person's arms up like a snow angel, like up above their head
[01:06:13] from the mountain. And it's just horrible. And they're in there. Yeah.
[01:06:17] Yeah. We're above. You have no leverage. You can't move. And so not only give me a snow
[01:06:21] inch, you've got me in double snow. So both my arms are stuck up there. Now, what was bad about this
[01:06:29] was there was a moment. Okay. And this was this is the rule that I learned because after we broke
[01:06:33] it down. So Dean kept me there for, you know, probably seven minutes in double snow angel,
[01:06:40] which is just a nightmare. Because he's not just holding me there. He's like saying things.
[01:06:44] And you know, he's antagonizing me. And I'm sitting there just wanting to kill him. And
[01:06:49] I forget he, I actually forget how it ended. I don't remember if he went for an arm lock and he
[01:06:54] got it or if he went, I got out. I forget how it ended because it's kind of a big blur, which most of
[01:06:59] my rules are. But anyways, the rule is, and I don't want to go into too much detail,
[01:07:04] be just because it's a little too technical and too hard to, you know, do through the audio
[01:07:07] podcast. But, you know, basically, I don't let my elbow cross the other person's sternum. I don't
[01:07:15] let it go across their sternum because if it does, you can get pin there. You can stuck there.
[01:07:19] So there was a moment where, when Dean was trying to move me into snow angel, where I should have
[01:07:24] sacrificed and done like a drastic movement that's a major breaking of that rule and turned to
[01:07:29] my side really hard and put my elbow across his sternum and it would have gotten me out.
[01:07:35] And as we, as we looked at it, you know, because once I was out, then we went over for a few minutes,
[01:07:40] just to just try and analyze what happened. And I realized that, you know, that I had to
[01:07:46] held onto this rule of mind even though part of me was like, you know, what, should I try it?
[01:07:51] And I didn't, I didn't try it. And so then I got a worse position, worse position, worse position.
[01:07:56] So the lesson learned is that sometimes you got to break your rules. Now, the thing is,
[01:08:02] it's not just you, Jitsu, right? It's not just you, Jitsu. It's about business. It's about life.
[01:08:09] It's about relationships. It's about not getting stuck in a rut. And it's about
[01:08:15] being able, because it's another thing is I, I was in my own head. I didn't detach from the
[01:08:21] situation. I didn't look at it from another position and say, okay, you know, this is getting worse
[01:08:26] right now. I just was stuck there mentally. So you got to think, you got to think about your rules
[01:08:34] objectively. And I didn't do that. And it's a rule that has, has saved me many times. But this time,
[01:08:41] it, it costs me nearly, nearly. So don't let your rules rule you. You got to keep ruling your rules.
[01:08:50] Don't let your rules rule you. Yeah, you, um, another way to kind of look at that is a, like, a
[01:08:56] black and white mind, you know, you don't, like, don't stick. Your mind is more or less black and
[01:09:03] white for sure. Well, as far as I think generally speaking, but don't neglect the gray.
[01:09:09] Yeah, just so much gray in there. And of course, you know, if you have rules and their solid rules,
[01:09:12] man, yeah, stick to those rules. But like I said, don't neglect the gray. You know, how you say,
[01:09:17] you got to break rule everyone, so I don't be just, hey, rules are meant to be broken. Let's just break
[01:09:22] it. Not don't do that. People use that as a, uh, some people use that as a, uh, excuse to do whatever
[01:09:27] they want. Right. Yeah, exactly. And they're wrong to, they lack the discipline.
[01:09:30] I'll, next question. Let's do it. I'm glad you use that. Mom, skip by the way. Check.
[01:09:44] Do you have any advice on consoling a member of your team that you're leading who knows
[01:09:50] there to blame for the project failing or, um, falling through? The person question is a great worker,
[01:09:57] but just made an honest mistake that cost that caused the failure of the project. If you
[01:10:03] extremely guilty for putting my job at risk and I can't convey to them enough that I understand
[01:10:08] it was an honest mistake. And then I personally failed to communicate enough with them. I think it's a
[01:10:14] great thing this person is so passionate at their job. But is there any way I can get them to distance
[01:10:22] themselves and show them that this one failure is not that big of a deal? So, um, yeah, like, like,
[01:10:35] the question says it's cool that you got somebody that's passionate, right? That's great.
[01:10:39] And it sounds like they want to take ownership and that's great too. It sounds like they are
[01:10:43] having trouble moving on. So, in this case, no, no major complication. This is not that big of a deal.
[01:10:50] You just got to talk them through it. And for me, I would use probably some kind of, you know,
[01:10:56] some stories, a real simple one is like about parachuting. And if you're parachuting,
[01:11:00] one of the main training points when you're parachuting and something goes wrong,
[01:11:05] yes, you don't get focused on just trying to fix the bad shoot. Because that's what gets people
[01:11:11] killed. They're looking up. They think maybe they can save the shoot. They think they can make it open
[01:11:15] somehow. And the next thing you know, they hit the ground, right? And they die. So, what they do is they
[01:11:21] they teach you that, hey, you got to bat you, you know, you pull your main parachute and it doesn't
[01:11:26] open correctly. You take a look at it, you go, okay, is this thing going to open or not? You make a
[01:11:30] decision and then you cut it away. And it's gone. And you focus on the next thing, which is getting
[01:11:36] your reserve parachute to come out to save your life. The one that didn't open doesn't matter
[01:11:40] anymore. So move on. You can think about it like a like a shooting competition, too, because it's the
[01:11:45] same thing. When you're shooting, you don't want to shoot. You don't want to think about the last shot
[01:11:52] that you just missed. And you don't want to think about the next shot. That's a hard shot or a
[01:11:57] far shot or you don't want to think about those other shots. You want to think about the shot
[01:12:00] that you're taking. That's the one that you want to think about. And if you're getting caught in the past,
[01:12:06] it's going to ruin what you're trying to do in the present. So you, you know, you have to move on.
[01:12:12] This is something you've got to explain to your employee that's getting your look, listen,
[01:12:16] I understand that you had a rough time. If you can't let that go, it's going to screw up the project
[01:12:20] or working on now. So let's let that go. Let's move on. So that's what I'd say. I'm saying,
[01:12:24] listen, look, buddy. I know this one went bad. I get it. You feel bad. Appreciate it. It's over.
[01:12:30] It's in the past. Let's take the lessons learned and we got to move on. It's not. Do I want
[01:12:36] yesterday? If we do well on yesterday, it takes our focus off of today and tomorrow, which are the
[01:12:42] things we can actually control. We can actually control what we're doing today. We can actually control
[01:12:47] what we're going to do tomorrow. We don't have any control over what happened yesterday. That's gone.
[01:12:51] So what I need you to do is focus on this mission now and making sure we execute it 100%.
[01:12:59] That sense of or that access to control over a situation that's so critical to know when you're
[01:13:09] in that position. Because to know what to know that you control it. Yeah, to have it on the front.
[01:13:14] What you can't in control. Yeah, to like I said, have access to that because it feels as
[01:13:19] farce feeling so. It feels like you use the parachute analogy. It feels like, there's the problem.
[01:13:26] The parachute, that's the problem. So all my attention and all my emotional
[01:13:30] energy is on that. That's the problem. But like I said, if you just
[01:13:36] under just focus on the fact that I can't control that bad shoot that bad shoot is gone.
[01:13:41] That's, you know, and cut it away. And yeah, focus on the thing. But like I said, man, that's
[01:13:46] the key right there to understand that man, you don't have control over that anymore. We're done
[01:13:51] with that. We're not doing that anymore. Yeah. We're doing this new stuff. You know, I should have said that
[01:13:55] on the last one about talking about breaking rules. I said business. I said, life, I forgot to say combat.
[01:13:59] But combat's the same way. If you get stuck in a standard operating procedure and you won't see
[01:14:03] your way out of it, you're going to pay and it's the same thing in combat. If you make one bad
[01:14:09] decision on the battlefield and now you start dwelling on that bad decision, you kind of forget about
[01:14:14] that. You got to move on. You got to move forward. So, you know, the only reason you look back,
[01:14:18] it's just assess the lessons learned. You're going to take away from it and then turn back around
[01:14:22] it. Look forward. Don't get sucked into the past and get drowned and pulled back there because
[01:14:26] you can't control it. You can't change what happened. Yeah. Move on, buddy. That other question,
[01:14:31] the black and white mind one, or you breaking your own rules. You're one rule. Kind of like,
[01:14:37] um, on Ghostbusters, one, don't cross the streams. You're watching Ghostbusters. Yeah.
[01:14:43] Same thing that. But then they had to eventually. Right. They had to cross the streams. The
[01:14:48] streams to kill that. The demon. Yeah. The urination man. I think you actually intentionally try to
[01:14:53] do this. That was a little reach. That was a little reach. Those are understandable terms.
[01:15:00] Okay.
[01:15:05] Jockel.
[01:15:09] What's the best advice heading into the military straight from high school?
[01:15:12] Well, and this this question is actually from my brothers from Downhunter,
[01:15:19] Cain, Dover, and Nicholas Bennett. And they've been, uh, they've been down there in Australia
[01:15:25] getting there getting there for a and wake up challenge on for about, I don't know, 35 or 40 days
[01:15:30] there at this point. And what's cool. What's been cool is hearing their feedback as they've kind of
[01:15:35] turned their lives around and they're getting all the stuff done. And actually, you know, it was
[01:15:38] hilarious. He sent a one of them said a tweet with a picture of a text conversation with some
[01:15:44] company that they were trying to work with. And it said something like the time on the tweet was,
[01:15:50] you know, 501 in the morning or something like that. And you know, he said, hey, you're still offering
[01:15:55] blank or some program or whatever. And then the response was, yes, we are still offering that. And then
[01:16:00] then the, you know, the reply was, okay, I'm really interested in accessing that program or whatever.
[01:16:06] And the response was, okay, but don't text people at 5 a.m. And then the response to that was, okay,
[01:16:14] wake up earlier, which I thought was classic. So those guys are rocking. It's very cool to see.
[01:16:21] So, and what it's actually one of the, and I figured, which one of them, one of their brothers is going
[01:16:25] in the military, which is awesome. Very cool to see Australian military work with them a little bit.
[01:16:30] Actually work with them on a small level a lot, meaning that I work with a couple of their soldiers a
[01:16:35] lot over the years, but I never worked with them in a big unit, but they were great guys.
[01:16:39] Here's a couple real simple things. And I'm assuming that he's going to some kind of army or
[01:16:43] some kind of ground for us. He's going to be a trooper on the ground. Obviously, being shape,
[01:16:49] do runs, do pushups, do situps, do pullups. I would say be ready to march in boots. That's one of the
[01:16:56] things that you do in any infantry unit that is shocking to civilians is putting on boots and
[01:17:03] putting on rucksacks and walking on distances. Well, do your feet get like your feet
[01:17:08] rushed? It's just a different kind of exercise. And we talked about before at Humberock, man.
[01:17:13] You got to just put on a rock and humberock and you got to wear whatever footwear they're going to
[01:17:17] supply you, trying to get the closest thing to that and get your feet ready for it so that you
[01:17:23] so that you don't get your feet destroyed, become football in the water. So most military has some
[01:17:29] kind of water testing. You know, we're going to throw you into pool, whatever. You know, going with
[01:17:35] a normal haircut, that's not going to make that big of a deal because, you know, they're going to
[01:17:38] shave your head within moments of showing up. So that's not the apricot of a deal. But, uh,
[01:17:43] detach. Okay. You're going to get these crappy situations where people in New
[01:17:46] Yellinachy were making you much stuff. Just detach, just detach and watch it because the drill
[01:17:51] instructors are hilarious. And if you're, if you're getting it, if they're in your face,
[01:17:56] you can be like, damn, this is harsh. But if they're in your face, but you're watching it from
[01:18:02] a free place of mind, it's so awesome to watch and it's so fun. And so easy to understand what they're
[01:18:06] doing. You know, you got to remember they're not going to kill you in training. And, and
[01:18:13] enjoy it. I had fun. I had fun in all my indoctrination courses, which is, you know, you're all
[01:18:19] your courses where you're getting treated like a recruit. So for me, it was boot camp. It was Buds.
[01:18:23] It was Airborne School and, and really an OCS too, Officer Cannon at school. All those things.
[01:18:29] I had a great time. I had a blast at those schools. I had fun getting indoctrinated. I embraced
[01:18:36] the little rules that they throw outside the barista and I take them to the extreme. And I had
[01:18:40] that's how I ended up having fun fun with it. And then the last thing I would say, and I actually,
[01:18:46] I almost missed this. But this is, this might be the most important thing. Okay. So you're 18 years old.
[01:18:55] You just got done with high school. You show up in the military and guess what? You start getting a paycheck.
[01:19:02] All of a sudden you're the richest guy in the world. Because at Mickey D's, you were making
[01:19:06] 750 an hour. And all of a sudden now you're getting a fat paycheck of, you know, $2200 a month.
[01:19:13] But you don't have any expenses. Because you're in the barracks or whatever. You've got all your food
[01:19:17] coming to you. So what are you going to do with that money? Well, a lot of guys in the military.
[01:19:23] What they do with that money is they blow it. They blow it on women and whiskey and they get the
[01:19:30] big toys. They get the massive toys. They get the massive trucks and motorcycles and hardlies and
[01:19:37] and everything. I got nothing against those things. But what you need to do is save your money.
[01:19:42] And, you know, they throw figures around 15% of your paycheck, 20% of your paycheck, 10% of your
[01:19:49] paycheck. But put that money somewhere long term where you're going to grow it. And then I would tell
[01:19:56] you, you know, on just by house, by house and then rent out the rooms to three guys and you sleep on the
[01:20:02] couch and have them be paying your mortgage. And when you get them all stabilized and that mortgage
[01:20:08] is kind of covered, it go by another house and do that every few years. And there's no reason
[01:20:16] to retire from the military and not be completely set where you never have to work again. If you just
[01:20:22] don't blow all your money on stuff that you don't need. And I'm not saying you got to live like a
[01:20:29] monk. But just don't blow all of it. Blow some of it. Don't blow all of it. And that's that's
[01:20:37] real important to all the folks doing the military or new to the military. You can make that happen.
[01:20:46] Financial discipline equals financial freedom. There you go.
[01:20:49] Good. Next question. I'm a firefighter slash paramedic. Historically, my profession has always
[01:20:59] been composed of alpha men. And all you had to worry about was teaching the skill and not the
[01:21:05] aggressive side of a person that is key within this job. We now face a new generation where they're
[01:21:10] hiring soft, they're hiring softer men. Quite a quote, softer men. Do the upper management and
[01:21:15] human resources criteria. So when you get these guys, the drive that is needed to do the job is not there.
[01:21:24] I truly believe that our profession is a calling that goes for all public servants in the
[01:21:30] material like. So my question to you is, how do you still aggression or passion? How do you
[01:21:35] instill it? How do you turn a soft man into an alpha male? Skill can be taught. But aggression and
[01:21:42] passion is where I come up short and tend to get frustrated because some people don't love this job the
[01:21:47] way I do. So soft men will potentially be put in a position where they may have to pull me out of fire
[01:21:54] or even save someone's life and aggression will be key. Call me crazy. But I'd rather have the
[01:22:00] alpha male that gets after it on a daily basis to pull me out. Yeah, no doubt about that. You want to
[01:22:06] have the guys that's going to be aggressive and make things happen at the moment of truth. So how do
[01:22:10] you do that? How do you still that? Well, number one hard training. You know, you've got to set up
[01:22:14] training for your people that is tough, that challenges them and at first they'll be some
[01:22:20] you know complaining about it and whatever else. But eventually people start to embrace that hard training
[01:22:26] that starts to make them feel proud. And that's what you want them to do. You want to push them
[01:22:33] mentally and physically and you want to have them understand a very important premise because
[01:22:43] if you take the fact that these guys are let's call them softer, well that means they want to have
[01:22:50] like you know they want to be safe. Right? Well, you need to teach these guys that the best way to
[01:22:56] mitigate risk is to be aggressive. Right? If you want to mitigate risk, the best way to mitigate
[01:23:04] risk is to be aggressive. So example, if you think a fight's going to happen, what's the best way to
[01:23:10] you know control that situation? It's to be aggressive to aggressively attack the enemy. If you're
[01:23:15] in a gun fighting situation and someone's attacking you, what's the best thing to do? It's
[01:23:19] flank them and attack them. You want to be aggressive in a firefight. If you're fighting a fire,
[01:23:26] you want to fight the fire. You don't want to let the fire burn and get out of control. You want
[01:23:30] to aggressively get the fire under control. So aggression is the best way to mitigate risk. So
[01:23:36] get these guys in that mentality of where they recognize that the aggression is an important
[01:23:43] facet of what they're doing and you want to put them in training scenarios where the aggression
[01:23:46] wins and Pacificity loses. You want to put them in situation where, oh, guess what? You sat back and
[01:23:51] waited and now we got the whole building on fire or you sat back and waited and now the people that we
[01:23:56] could rescue three minutes ago are going to die because you hesitated at the moment of truth.
[01:24:01] So you got to teach them that aggressiveness over and over and over again. And I think that's
[01:24:08] that's what you got to do. I know that I want to once you'll officer that I was working with,
[01:24:20] we were going through land warfare training and land warfare training is you got
[01:24:26] machine guns firing, you got rockets going off, you got smoke grenades, it's man. And if you're going
[01:24:32] to, you have to grab control of the situation. So you're doing it what we call immediate action
[01:24:38] drills and everyone's shooting live fire and maneuvering and you've got to grab control of the
[01:24:44] situation and you've got to make things happen aggressively through force of will. And so this
[01:24:52] once you'll officer, you're going to have to all this great guy, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he
[01:24:55] was not making it happen. He wasn't being aggressive enough. And I said to him, I said, hey man,
[01:25:01] you got to be more aggressive, you got to get, you got to get fired up with your guys.
[01:25:06] And he said, he literally said to me, I remember like it was yesterday, he goes,
[01:25:09] I don't know if I can get any more fired up. And I said, okay, hang with me. And just just follow
[01:25:21] me. And I took command of his squad of eight guys. And I said, just follow me. So we went,
[01:25:28] we got in a contact drill and the shooting started and boom, I showed him what aggressive look like.
[01:25:33] Hey, you two set up on this corner right there. You get up there, start laying down fire,
[01:25:39] you over here, start getting ahead count as you yelling, placing guys, making it happen through
[01:25:44] force of will. It's being aggressive. And it was that was all took.
[01:25:50] Like he just didn't understand the difference. He didn't understand what aggression looked like
[01:25:56] and he didn't understand how it impacted the situation. When you're not being aggressive out on
[01:26:02] the battlefield, you have no control. Things will just, things will just happen and you will have no
[01:26:08] control of them. So, and guess what? It's the same thing in life. If you're not aggressively
[01:26:15] pursuing your goals. Again, that doesn't mean you're aggressively confronting people at every turn.
[01:26:24] No, it means you're aggressively pursuing your goals. Yeah. Through any means necessary.
[01:26:29] Again, people get confused and think that I'm in someone's face. Hey, we're doing this my way.
[01:26:34] No, no, no, you're aggressively pursuing your goals. You're not aggressively pursuing people.
[01:26:39] You're not aggressively pursuing personalities. You're not aggressively confronting people.
[01:26:43] You're confronting the challenge. Not the people. Do you have to confront people? Sometimes,
[01:26:47] yes, of course you do. Which you're aggressively confronting and attacking the challenge.
[01:26:53] The mission. Not the people. But anyways, this guy didn't quite understand. So I had to show him.
[01:27:00] I had to let him see what that looked like. What it looked like to say, you know, hey, take it
[01:27:05] out right here. Grab a guy and say, stop a corner right here. Start moving guys and have them see that.
[01:27:10] And guess what? Then you get the other people in the squad start seeing it and they start
[01:27:16] acting aggressively to make things happen. And that's when you do it. That's what you do.
[01:27:24] And obviously what that means is you as a leader, you have to lead. You have to show these guys the
[01:27:32] way how important aggression is and how to do it. Yeah. And kind of in life, I think you can
[01:27:40] because again, it's one of those things that sounds pretty simple. It's either be aggressive or you're
[01:27:46] not being aggressive kind of thing, but it's so hard because like for example, if you're in life,
[01:27:52] a lot of people they sit back and wait for things to kind of happen like, oh, I'm waiting.
[01:27:55] You know, you hear people say it and it just hasn't happened for me yet and I'm waiting for my big
[01:27:59] brain kind of thing. No wrong attitude. Yeah, exactly. But when you're in that situation,
[01:28:04] it kind of seems like that's how the world works. So it doesn't, and a lot of it, you know,
[01:28:10] it's maybe how people are raised. I don't know where if you don't know what that is that if you don't
[01:28:18] have access to that feeling of being an aggressive person, it's hard to get there. Until like
[01:28:23] how you say it's someone shows you like in the exact situation that you're in and in your
[01:28:27] cases that one specific of training situation, you show them how. So it probably clicked right away,
[01:28:33] but in life, there's all these situations. So just to be an aggressive person might be kind of
[01:28:38] hard for someone to access unless they have like a mentor or someone who demonstrated it.
[01:28:43] It definitely is. It definitely is hard in life. It's hard to show people all the different
[01:28:47] situations. And because then you are also kind of up with people that are overly aggressive, right?
[01:28:52] Or aggressive on the wrong way. The aggressive in the wrong direction. You know, I said this
[01:28:55] something that some of the other day, they were talking about being that they're talking about like,
[01:29:00] I'm super passionate about this. And I said, don't aim your passion at the people because people
[01:29:05] find that offensive. You got to aim your passion at the mission and let. I mean, there'll be
[01:29:11] some collateral encouragement when people see someone that's fired up. When people see someone that's
[01:29:17] passionate, it makes people excited about the mission as well. But if I hit you with my passion,
[01:29:23] if I aim my passion at you, all of a sudden you're intimidated by it, you're turned off by it,
[01:29:28] you're defamed defensive by it. So that's what you have to be careful. If you want to aim your
[01:29:33] passion, aim your aggression at the mission, not at the people. What you want to do with people,
[01:29:40] you want to influence them. You want to steer them. You want to pull them along. You want to make
[01:29:45] them give them the idea. So they think that they're moving in that direction on their own. You
[01:29:50] actually want them to be. Never mind. Think you want them to move in that direction on their own.
[01:29:54] That's leadership. And so that's what you got to do with this aggressive thing. It's definitely a
[01:29:58] really good question. I would also say, what, what music are they listening to? What, what,
[01:30:04] what TV shows are they watching? What movies are they watching? Are they watching? You have to see
[01:30:09] you straight up. Are they watching people fight? Are you doing any training? Are you hitting
[01:30:15] bags? Are you throwing some mojtai kicks? Are you grappling? You know, do those things raise
[01:30:22] aggression levels? Are they working out hard? You know, they're like no kidding. Squatting heavy
[01:30:28] weights increases your testosterone period. It really does. So get on the squat rack and start
[01:30:37] getting that testosterone flow through your system. Yeah. Let's go to the next question.
[01:30:47] Be aggressive on that one. Just be aggressive and lead aggressively.
[01:30:51] Yeah, funny how you mentioned UFC because you can kind of in that regard, you can learn a little bit
[01:30:58] because you can hear like you always hear the coach or whatever yelling saying be first. Be first.
[01:31:03] Be first. Be first. Don't do stuff like that. Yeah. You definitely don't hear him say, hey,
[01:31:08] sit back and wait to get attacked. Yeah, exactly. You don't hear him say, okay, be defensive. Yeah,
[01:31:13] or be past. Yeah, exactly. Does it happen? Next question. Some jiu jitsu talk.
[01:31:19] What type of style do you play? Aggressive, passive, reactive, or smash and pass?
[01:31:29] etc. Well, I mean, I've trained with you. You probably, you know, have an assessment,
[01:31:36] your assessment of my game, which will be a limited assessment, by the way, because the game that I
[01:31:41] show you is the is the is built to contend with what you bring to the table. Yeah. If you
[01:31:48] brought it something else, you'd see something else. Yeah, and I have a little bit beyond that,
[01:31:53] because I witnessed you in the all the time, more so before the notice, but yeah, I would say my assessment.
[01:32:01] Yeah, okay, yeah, so you watch me with other people, and you can see. So you do see that I trained
[01:32:06] different ways with other people. Yeah, and really that's really the core of the evaluation,
[01:32:10] is that when you roll with people, it's like you're real, um, it's like variable style,
[01:32:17] you know, it changes. So, and it depends your mood to, like if you're just messing around with
[01:32:24] me or whatever, you're like, you know, this is kind of weird, but you do this thing that no one
[01:32:29] really does, and you look like you look me in the eye, like while you're rolling, it's weird,
[01:32:34] because I know you're just messing with me, like, like, everything I do, you're like, oh,
[01:32:38] who knows cute kind of kind of an attitude, and then, you know, if I talk too much, you know,
[01:32:43] whatever, then you'll, yeah, it's smashing past. So in regards to these these choices,
[01:32:50] all, all of the above, right? So, so passive when you're kind of taunting and maybe even learning,
[01:32:58] or not, you're taunting a style of jujitsu. Yes, it is, it's your style.
[01:33:05] And so you'll be passive kind of waiting for me to do something, and then if it doesn't work,
[01:33:09] then you taunt some more, and then, so that's passive, and then reactive is obviously, you know,
[01:33:13] and reacting to anything that I try to do. Aggressive is when either time runs, is running short,
[01:33:20] or I talk too much, and smashing past is the result of that aggressive stuff.
[01:33:27] In really, in replace of smashing past, oh, I mean, I think the alternate for me is,
[01:33:31] is a little something that we like to call the disrespect, right? The disrespect?
[01:33:35] Yeah, which is when you just completely disrespect the person's guard and just pass and smash them.
[01:33:40] Yeah, yeah, the disrespect for us.
[01:33:44] Yeah, and I think the key point for this for me is that, I agree with you. Like I have a decent guard.
[01:33:52] I have a good top position, pretty good at card passing, or whatever. I'm not, I'm not
[01:33:56] graded jujitsu, but I'm decent at some areas, and I'm pretty, one thing I am is I'm pretty comfortable.
[01:34:02] Like in just about any situation, there's no situation where I'm, there's no situation where I'm freaked out.
[01:34:09] Like I don't mind being in half-garden online, being on half-garden top bottom,
[01:34:12] I don't mind being guard closed open, whatever, I don't mind being mounted. I can pretty much handle
[01:34:17] any situation. You know, and again, when you're training with Dean, you get, you get very comfortable
[01:34:23] with people because you have a guy that's just a savage, and, but what's interesting about this
[01:34:31] is for me, and I talked about this, I mean, I talked about this, there's a dichotomy here, right?
[01:34:36] Like if being aggressive is not working, then you have to try that other game. You know,
[01:34:42] I always say if you're, if you're trying to pass someone's guard really close and you can't do it
[01:34:47] back away because there's an opening there, and it's the same again, it's the same thing with
[01:34:53] wife, right? If you're beating your head against a wall, try a different route. When there's one
[01:34:58] door that's closed or heavily defended, in combat, go find another door, go breach a window,
[01:35:04] go find another way, there's an opening somewhere else. And I think that's what my game is.
[01:35:13] I think that's what my game is. It's like you said variable, based on a variety of
[01:35:21] influences both in my world and in my opponents world. Yeah, and surprisingly, and I think that
[01:35:32] people, a lot of people, wouldn't really assume this right away, is that you're, um, yeah, sure,
[01:35:38] you're gonna smash and you're aggressive and kind of rough a lot of times, but you're like, um,
[01:35:44] like a playful, you get to guy. Oh, I was gonna say this, and this is, I think this is important. I had a guy
[01:35:49] ask me, how hard do you go? And the answer is very easy. I go just hard enough that I'm staying
[01:35:58] ahead of the other person. Now with you, if those of you that are listening on audio,
[01:36:04] that was making a face because there are times when I have to step up my game a little bit and
[01:36:09] put the wood. Sometimes we're straight up, that's not true. Yeah, okay. Okay, yeah, but there might be some,
[01:36:16] oh, you know why? That's because you come in with, sometimes you come in with a, you know,
[01:36:24] with an attitude of, yeah, I can see it in your eyes. You're like, today's the day. Mm-hmm.
[01:36:28] And you come in there and you got the this series look on your face now. Okay, cool. It's going to be
[01:36:32] like that right on. Mm-hmm. And so you know, yeah, I have to bring the needle a little bit.
[01:36:37] Yeah, yeah, yeah, full. Yeah. But that same, and this is the part where I think it's kind of
[01:36:44] kind of interesting is that you do, it doesn't seem like a war. Like it seems like a war, but all
[01:36:50] within the confines of some silly, getting that silly, but some game. Yeah. But, but it's obvious though.
[01:36:58] You know, like, I think that someone who may be never seen your role or never had that experience
[01:37:03] with you specifically, they would assume that you're this like, heavy, mindy, that's going to show.
[01:37:08] I'm going to smash in that, and that I'm taking this really serious. Yeah. No, I know.
[01:37:12] Because some guys are like that. Yeah, that's true. It's not that I don't take Jiu-Jitsu seriously,
[01:37:16] but Jiu-Jitsu is a fun to me. Right. It's so fun to me. Yeah. And I think that the better you get
[01:37:22] the more fun it gets and unless you have to be like that, you know. And I don't mind when people
[01:37:27] come at me like that, because I still get to do the same thing. You know, I still get to have fun.
[01:37:32] Yeah. And yeah, no, Jiu-Jitsu should be fun. Yeah. Really should be fun. The funner is for you,
[01:37:37] the wrong. You're going to do it for. Now, part of the fun can be submitting people and you get
[01:37:42] people that that's the only fun that they have in Jiu-Jitsu is when they submit people. And that's
[01:37:45] not what I'm talking about. Yeah. I think that's kind of the transitions and the flowing and the
[01:37:51] utilization of moves and the cool things that happen. And you know, sometimes I'll be wrong with
[01:37:57] whoever. And it's like someone just like someone will do something really cool when you start laughing.
[01:38:01] Right. And that was awesome. That's Jiu-Jitsu. That's right. Jiu-Jitsu should be fun. It shouldn't be this.
[01:38:07] It shouldn't be the fun shouldn't come from just submitting people. Right. That's just bullying,
[01:38:17] right? Yeah. And way. And you know, you shouldn't get, you should at a certain point, you're going
[01:38:22] to, okay, go like and tap people out. But let's let's do this for the reason of the
[01:38:27] dysport itself, the the game itself, which is a fun game. Yeah, I think guys who told me straight
[01:38:33] up that when they're driving up to the gym, they have anxiety. Yeah. But anxiety like, oh,
[01:38:39] how am I going to do? Or if they get tapped out, it ruins their day or their week or whatever.
[01:38:44] Yeah. But man. I have none of that. Yeah. I'm rolling the jump. Jim just in totally, you know,
[01:38:50] totally happy to be able to be getting there and get and get to do something that's so fun.
[01:38:54] Yeah. Yeah. I rolled with Chris Martin today for it. And it was all, you can make jokes. You can talk
[01:39:02] trash and you can do all this stuff while you're rolling. And doing that in this playful, I mean,
[01:39:07] don't be a dick, you know, but you know, just like, yeah, you can push being a dick. Sometimes.
[01:39:14] It makes it more fun for sure. Like you can, you know, you can call him moving and do it on the
[01:39:18] guy if you're better than him or whatever. And it makes it fun though, you know. And me and Chris,
[01:39:22] we're doing that the whole time. Oh, what is this? Oh, how does that feel kind of thing? Yeah.
[01:39:27] And of course, that's taken to extreme because I know Chris for long. Yeah, we're just
[01:39:30] but talking to just a little bit of that makes it more fun. Just like if you're playing a video
[01:39:35] game, just like if you're playing any other game, just talk some friend. You know, it's it's part of
[01:39:38] the fun. Yeah. And like I said, my original point is I think people wouldn't assume that about you
[01:39:44] given how you may come off sometimes. But you're really like that. No, I do, do, do you fund
[01:39:50] me? No doubt. Unsporched for sure. But even up, do you do in a way like when you're surfing in
[01:39:59] California, there's a, there's a much harder vibe surfing in California than there is in the
[01:40:06] mats for sure. You know, when, you know, when we're surfing where I surf, like it's, it's a
[01:40:14] gang mentality type situation, you know. And so on the mats, it's just so fun to be in a situation.
[01:40:20] But and surfing, you know, leads to fighting often. Oh, yeah. And so, but in Gitu, the fighting is
[01:40:27] already happening. Right. Right. So, so it's, you know, you can, you kind of over it. And now,
[01:40:32] now we're just, we're already fighting. So now we can just chill. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's crazy
[01:40:37] else surfing's like that, right? So this would be this kind of thing. No, it's not. No, it's
[01:40:42] not. Yeah. No, it's impossible. It's not. It's an aggressive, it's a very aggressive environment.
[01:40:45] It's like a territorial thing. It's a very territorial thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of cool. I like it.
[01:40:51] You like that. Next question. I understand and agree with all your thoughts in principles.
[01:41:02] However, however, interpret your concepts for leaders leading men, or mostly driven, or other
[01:41:12] leaders who have a desire to make themselves better and maintaining the status. Yep. So common misperception,
[01:41:20] right, is that, you know, the military and the seals. I say this all time. Everyone thinks that
[01:41:27] the military and the seals, I think that we're leading Terminator robots. Right. And everyone is just
[01:41:33] driven and they're going to get up and they're going to do everything. And it's, I just talked about
[01:41:36] this on the last podcast. It is a bell curve. It is a bell curve and there's a great bunch of guys
[01:41:42] at the top of the bell curve that are go getters. There's a solid bunch of guys in the middle.
[01:41:45] There's a load of guys that are bumps. And so this interpretation that the concepts that I talk about
[01:41:52] are just for leading these front running A personalities that just make everything happen.
[01:42:01] Not correct. You know, there are seals that don't want to work. There are seals that want to
[01:42:06] take shortcuts. There are seals that want to escape. By then you get outside. Then you work with
[01:42:10] Iraqi soldiers that are unmotivated, untrained, poorly equipped. We got to work with these guys.
[01:42:16] We got bosses. I mean, I got bosses in the seal teams that are either an e-go maniac or that are
[01:42:23] ultra riskers. You can have any of this stuff going on. You can have your guys that are
[01:42:28] riskers. You can have guys that are too crazy. You got all, you know what they are?
[01:42:34] They're humans. They're individuals. They're human beings. And because they're human beings,
[01:42:40] even in special operations. And sometimes especially in special operations. Because when you get
[01:42:44] in special operations, you guys that have huge egos and attitudes. And so, oh, you think that they just
[01:42:50] want to do whatever you tell them to do. No, they got their own idea. They got their own method.
[01:42:54] They got their own plan. They got their own what they think they're a tactical genius. So you
[01:42:58] got to get around that. So what does it mean? It means you have to lead them. And it's the common
[01:43:06] theme that I'm talking about all the time. And it was, I mean, you got to build relationships.
[01:43:10] You got to build the trust. You got to make sure they understand why they're doing what they're
[01:43:13] doing. You got to make sure they understand the strategic impact. You got to empower them. You
[01:43:17] got to set a good example. You got to listen to them. You got to take input. You got to give them
[01:43:22] response. And when I say response, I mean, real responsibility. You got to build them up. You got to
[01:43:29] make them better. You got to show them and let them see not in a, not in a in your face way. But you
[01:43:40] got to subtly let them see what self improvement means them and how they can better the position
[01:43:46] and what drive will get them. You got to give them ownership stuff. And you got to let that ownership
[01:43:55] grow into extreme ownership where they really want to own things. You got to teach them to lead.
[01:44:00] And you got to put them in leadership positions. And you got to show your trust by actually following
[01:44:05] them sometimes. And again, people ask me these questions. You know, how a new leader. How do I lead?
[01:44:13] I got a new person. How do I lead them? It's the same answers. It's the same answers all the time
[01:44:17] that principles of leadership. Now the nuances are there. Yes, the nuances are there. And I have
[01:44:22] to nuance for echo that I got a nuance for this guy over here. And I got a nuance for this group over
[01:44:27] here. The nuances are there. But the basic principles are the same. Am I never, I'm going to,
[01:44:32] who am I going to be in charge of that? I'm not going to try and build a relationship of trust with them.
[01:44:36] Who's that? The answer is nobody. You know, who is it that I don't want to set a good example for?
[01:44:41] The answer is nobody. Who is it that I'm not going to listen to? If you don't listen to people
[01:44:46] you alienate them, you don't want to be part of the team. I mean, it's, it's things are universal. And again,
[01:44:53] there's nuances because you might have to make adaptations. And you know, when we, when we did
[01:44:58] battle leadership with, with, with, uh, eight off von Schell, and he talks about distinctly these three
[01:45:04] different types of commanders and how the, the boss gave them each their own little adjusted order
[01:45:10] because he was dealing with their personalities. So yes, you got to deal with the personalities,
[01:45:14] but that doesn't mean you're doing something different from the principles. So,
[01:45:22] when you get sure, when you get to the bottom of the bell curve, you might see some people that
[01:45:27] might need to be replaced. They might need to be removed, but I'll tell you what, most likely,
[01:45:35] they just need to be led. The reason that, or I think one of the reasons why
[01:45:43] the, the perception is that all your guys are robots and, you know, I'm going to give you an order.
[01:45:48] They follow it. No question that is like movies, right? Like a few good men,
[01:45:53] member of the Jack Nicholson, he's like, people follow orders or people die. Yeah, that's his thing.
[01:45:59] And they say that kind of stuff. Yeah, and, but they do, they do capture it and somehow we would
[01:46:04] move these where they show how mute knees take place and now things go wrong and how, you know,
[01:46:10] the new Lieutenant Vietnam is going to get fragged by his own people. That stuff's real. Yeah,
[01:46:16] you know, that stuff's real. So, it's just, it's a misperception. The other misperception is because
[01:46:23] of boot camp, a lot of military movies are, they show a significant amount of time in boot camp,
[01:46:30] but boot camp is a matter of weeks, you know, career. You know, I think Marine Corps boot camp is 13
[01:46:35] weeks. I think Army boot camp is 10 weeks. Boot camp is a very short period of time and you're
[01:46:42] four year, six year, eight year, 10 year, 20 year career. Boot camp is, you know, I talked about
[01:46:47] the indoctrination all times in the military. They have very short periods of time compared to your
[01:46:52] whole career. And in boot camp, when your drone structure says drop down and do pushups, you drop down
[01:46:57] your pushups and boot camp, when your drone structure says pick up that, you know, make your bed,
[01:47:02] you make your bed when they's, and if you don't, they yell at you and they yell at you until you do
[01:47:06] make your bed. So, people get that idea that that's the way the military is run. Yeah,
[01:47:11] yeah, and that is, you know, a great example is full metal jacket, the movie, which is a great
[01:47:16] movie, but the boot camp scene is half the movie, but in reality, even if you were a guy in
[01:47:24] Vietnam, you know, boot camp is 13 weeks and then you went on to interview it in on for a year.
[01:47:28] So, it's a fraction of what your real career is like and so people get that impression that
[01:47:35] you're just going to be able to bar recorders never is going to listen you, it just doesn't work
[01:47:39] that way. And there's actually there's a great, there's a great video, it's called Charlie Company
[01:47:46] in V, anyways, I forget the name of the video, but it's about a company in Vietnam, Charlie Company,
[01:47:53] and maybe if you remind me, I'll put it on the website. It shows two company commanders,
[01:48:01] but anyways, to make a long story short, these guys, they don't like their new company commander.
[01:48:08] And at first, the resistant to him, and he says, listen, these guys,
[01:48:12] you've got to learn that there's going to have to do what I tell him. And then it fasts
[01:48:18] forwards a couple months. And they interview him again and he goes, you know, how's everything going?
[01:48:22] He goes, you know, they get it now and they realize that they just have to listen to me and do what I told him.
[01:48:26] And then they go out in the field with the guys. And the guys in the field, they're supposed to be
[01:48:32] doing things, they're just not doing them. They're just literally calm back like, yeah, we did, yeah,
[01:48:37] we did a patrol. They didn't do it. Yeah, we moved positions, they didn't move positions. Yeah,
[01:48:42] we're going to do another, you know, another football patrol tonight. They're not doing it.
[01:48:46] So, he was under the impression that everyone had like buckled to his will.
[01:48:50] Right. Right. They were just completely snowing him and he had no idea.
[01:48:54] So that's what happens in the military. If you don't lead to your people and you just order them around
[01:49:00] and you think that everyone's just this, this, this, how they described it here,
[01:49:06] then who are mostly driven or leaders who haven't desired to make themselves better. I mean,
[01:49:12] if anybody in a position with the guys like that, it's going to, the leadership job is going to be very easy.
[01:49:17] You just tell them what to do and they do it. Right. I mean, I could give you an example upon
[01:49:22] example upon example of stuff in the SEAL teams where what I had to do to get people convinced that
[01:49:27] this was the right thing to do. You know, I mean, it is like, you know, a classic example is telling
[01:49:33] guys, okay, we're going to take Iraqi soldiers on every operation. You know, so these guys were saying,
[01:49:38] are you kidding me? Well, they didn't even go, hey, cool, Joko, we'll do exactly what you tell us.
[01:49:43] Right. No, they were, what are you talking about? I'm not taking these guys out. Why would we do that?
[01:49:46] It's going to be risky. These guys aren't trustworthy. They're not trained. They're a million
[01:49:50] reasons why not to do that. But how do you get them to do it? You explain to them why you explain to
[01:49:58] them the strategic importance. You have built trust with them. You tell them that they're going
[01:50:03] to take ownership of their Iraqis. I mean, it's everything that I just said. That's what you do.
[01:50:07] That's a classic example. So, yes, once again, you have, if you're in a leadership position,
[01:50:15] you have to lead. You ever seen them movie saving private, right? Yes. Yeah, there was a part
[01:50:22] of them. And that movie that they weren't down for the orders. Remember that way, it was kind of like
[01:50:30] a little pivotal part where they were going to go take a machine gunness. And they were like,
[01:50:34] man, we don't have to do this. So they all kind of got together today. You know,
[01:50:38] seems like unnecessary risk. And he's like, he kind of tripped out a little bit and kind of forced
[01:50:43] them to do it. And they were like, all right, whatever. Kind of reluctantly than one of the
[01:50:47] guys died and stuff. But you know, that's an example. Yeah, and especially, you know, you
[01:50:52] when we were just doing talking about World War I, that one portion of the book where he says,
[01:50:57] you know what, we got to order to do this thing. I didn't feel good about it, but it was an order
[01:51:00] we were going to do it. So there's examples from the past, especially where, you know, it's
[01:51:05] definitely was more like that. And the past in World War I, obviously it was like that.
[01:51:09] Obviously it was like that. Unfortunately it was like that. Yeah. Because it caused people to
[01:51:14] continue, you know, to execute these operations that we're just going to get people killed.
[01:51:21] And you know, actually, Laefan, I were talking about that last week, pick its chart, get it, pick
[01:51:26] its charts, get his bird. They sent the troops up and they got slaughtered. And they came, you know,
[01:51:32] the survivors came back and Lee was, you know, basically in tears like, hey, I'm sorry, this happened.
[01:51:40] I, this was my fault. He took ownership of it. And I hope I'm getting the story right. But
[01:51:49] but that's the, that's the general, the general just of the story. But then that, you know,
[01:51:55] the big story was that the guys were like, hey, we'll go again if you, you know, because you're
[01:52:00] such a great leader will go again in Laef, you know, was kind of like, that's what World War,
[01:52:06] you know, that's what, that's what happened. That, that, that shows you that guys were willing.
[01:52:10] And I said, yeah, but the difference is in World War I, they sent them again. They sent them over
[01:52:15] and, you know, Lee was regretting and I'm sorry and I did something like, I got you, you know,
[01:52:20] bunch of guys killed. It's horrible in World War I and they're like, yeah, it happened, going again.
[01:52:24] Yeah. Oh, yeah, and that happens again. We're doing it again. And again, and again, and it's just
[01:52:28] to, I'll, I'll, I'll always just be horrified by that. And hopefully, um, man progresses beyond that.
[01:52:39] And again, part of that is as a person, you have to question, you have to be a rebel. You have to
[01:52:48] question what people are telling you and why they're telling it to you. If my boss doesn't tell me
[01:52:53] why I'm doing my operation, it's, and I continue to execute it. That's my fault. I need to raise my hand.
[01:52:59] It's a boss. What are we doing? Why are we doing this? I don't understand. You got to take that initiative.
[01:53:05] Because if you're just blindly following orders, I don't want somebody that's blindly following orders.
[01:53:10] I never want people that blindly following my orders. I want people that say, oh, get boss, wait. Why are we doing this?
[01:53:17] Why is this happening? Because I want people, I want think, I want leaders underneath me that know how to lead. And you know what?
[01:53:24] When you build the trust and you build the relationships, those guys will do anything for you.
[01:53:31] And my guys and my task is to do anything. I mean, I know it. They did over and over again.
[01:53:37] Did operations that were crazy and hard and dangerous and risky. Never did anyone say, oh, you know,
[01:53:46] we're not doing this. Is it okay? We understand what's the mission? All right.
[01:53:52] So you've got to build that. Well, it's against the same basic principles of leading human beings.
[01:53:59] And that's what you've got to do. But to think that you're just going to order people to do things. It's not happening.
[01:54:06] Long answer to a two a two a good question. That was actually interesting perspective. And I know it's a perspective that a lot of people have.
[01:54:12] People always think, well, you know, you led seals and they're in there. So that was easy.
[01:54:17] Yeah, but before you said, before you told me, that's kind of what I figured. Yeah.
[01:54:24] Last question.
[01:54:28] Juckle, any tips for breaking habits of laziness and procrastination?
[01:54:34] Maybe some good reads on the subject. And this is a question I wish you would answer for me like 10 years ago.
[01:54:40] So yeah, any tips?
[01:54:45] You know, this has definitely been a pretty common question when people want to know how to stop the laziness.
[01:54:54] And they want to not stop the procrastination. And you know, they have some idea in their head,
[01:55:02] you know, some kind of a vision of what they want to do. But they don't know where to start.
[01:55:11] They don't know where to start. They don't know where to start.
[01:55:15] And say, they say, hey, where do I start? And when's the best time to start? And I have a very simple answer for that.
[01:55:23] Here and now that's it. You want to improve. You want to get better. You want to get on a workout program or a clean diet.
[01:55:39] You want to start a business. You want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or put together some
[01:55:48] mobile application. Where do you start? You start right here. And when do you start? You start right now.
[01:56:03] You initiate the action aggressively. You go.
[01:56:09] Because the idea isn't going to execute itself. And the book isn't going to write itself. And the
[01:56:15] weights out in the gym. They're not going to move themselves. You have to do it. And you have to do it now.
[01:56:25] And that means you got to stop thinking about it and stop dreaming about it and stop researching every
[01:56:32] aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it. Just start doing it.
[01:56:38] Take that first step and make it happen. Get after it. Get after it here and now.
[01:56:54] And I think that's all we've got for tonight. So thanks everybody for listening to this
