00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.28
This is Jockel podcast number 225 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:10.60 --> 00:00:15.96
Last month I went to a memorial service

3
00:00:18.48 --> 00:00:21.68
And it was the first memorial service that I had been to

4
00:00:23.12 --> 00:00:25.12
For a long time that wasn't

5
00:00:25.12 --> 00:00:27.12
For a seal

6
00:00:30.80 --> 00:00:37.32
It was the first memorial service that I had been to for a long time that was for someone who died of

7
00:00:39.88 --> 00:00:41.88
Natural causes

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
A memorial service for someone that had actually

9
00:00:47.68 --> 00:00:49.68
lived their full life

10
00:00:50.32 --> 00:00:52.32
expectancy 80

11
00:00:52.32 --> 00:00:58.16
80 years or maybe 82 years or 83. I don't I don't remember the exact number

12
00:01:01.20 --> 00:01:05.60
Which is kind of interesting in its own right because when someone that's younger dies

13
00:01:08.96 --> 00:01:11.96
Then everyone talks about their age

14
00:01:11.96 --> 00:01:17.16
No everyone says he was only 26 so we was just 28 years only 32

15
00:01:22.20 --> 00:01:24.20
They not been to

16
00:01:25.16 --> 00:01:27.16
far too many

17
00:01:27.16 --> 00:01:30.12
Funerals and memorial services like that

18
00:01:30.12 --> 00:01:36.12
Fartumany

19
00:01:36.12 --> 00:01:40.36
Funerals where the morning that is taking place

20
00:01:42.20 --> 00:01:44.20
is about

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
What is never going to get done?

22
00:01:51.40 --> 00:01:53.72
Potential that wasn't

23
00:01:54.92 --> 00:01:56.92
reached

24
00:01:56.92 --> 00:02:02.68
The life that was cut short, but this this memorial was for the

25
00:02:04.20 --> 00:02:08.52
Patriarch of a group of families who are friends with my family

26
00:02:10.68 --> 00:02:14.60
And this man this old man had three sons who are friends of mine

27
00:02:15.72 --> 00:02:20.04
And those sons all have kids and all our kids grew up together and we

28
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:24.52
Have done a lot over the years surfing and

29
00:02:26.84 --> 00:02:29.64
Camping and climbing and playing music

30
00:02:32.76 --> 00:02:36.76
Playing music around the campfire or in the in the little studio

31
00:02:40.92 --> 00:02:42.60
And I actually known these guys for

32
00:02:42.60 --> 00:02:49.000
For over 20 years and because I knew them I knew their old man too

33
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:54.04
And the old man was

34
00:02:55.96 --> 00:02:58.68
You know he was a stud in his own right

35
00:03:01.08 --> 00:03:04.12
He was going strong he was an athlete he was an entrepreneur

36
00:03:06.12 --> 00:03:10.12
He likes sports and beer and rock and roll and

37
00:03:10.12 --> 00:03:12.12
Late nights

38
00:03:13.96 --> 00:03:17.16
Again this guy was an older guy you know 75

39
00:03:18.44 --> 00:03:23.88
78 80 years old in his later years and then he poured everything he could into his family

40
00:03:26.92 --> 00:03:28.92
Into his kids and into their kids

41
00:03:33.96 --> 00:03:35.96
And he was a good man

42
00:03:35.96 --> 00:03:39.24
And he

43
00:03:40.52 --> 00:03:43.56
lived a good life and their memorial service was

44
00:03:44.28 --> 00:03:47.80
You know a small kind of private affair

45
00:03:48.92 --> 00:03:50.92
You know there was probably

46
00:03:52.12 --> 00:03:54.12
I don't know

47
00:03:54.12 --> 00:03:56.12
70 or 80 people there

48
00:03:57.48 --> 00:04:03.000
You know all the extended family of all the kids and then friends the family and some of his friends and it was

49
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.28
Was a nice service and I

50
00:04:08.60 --> 00:04:10.60
I said a few words

51
00:04:14.44 --> 00:04:24.60
And I kind of you know told a funny story I you know his his son, his bow his sons, it's bowing his wife it's bowing it was is emotional and I

52
00:04:26.60 --> 00:04:28.60
You know I I

53
00:04:28.60 --> 00:04:32.44
Took the opportunity to lighten the mood a little and

54
00:04:34.76 --> 00:04:39.32
What I talked about as I talked about how he he would listen

55
00:04:41.40 --> 00:04:43.88
When his sons and me would

56
00:04:44.76 --> 00:04:46.76
play music

57
00:04:46.76 --> 00:04:48.76
Back in the day

58
00:04:48.76 --> 00:04:53.88
And we would play for hours and he would listen for hours and and and listen when I talk about

59
00:04:54.52 --> 00:04:56.68
Us playing music. I'm talking about us just

60
00:04:56.68 --> 00:04:58.68
Just just

61
00:04:58.68 --> 00:05:00.68
jamming and riffing and

62
00:05:01.56 --> 00:05:06.12
We're talking about songs that are 15 or 20 or 30 minutes long just

63
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.48
Just songs that are just meandering through

64
00:05:11.16 --> 00:05:13.80
Riffs and bridges and versus and

65
00:05:14.68 --> 00:05:19.08
Going from just droning heavy thunder to like quiet

66
00:05:20.84 --> 00:05:22.84
Acoustic jams and

67
00:05:22.84 --> 00:05:28.12
All these different songs to be played just one time and one time only

68
00:05:30.68 --> 00:05:32.28
Just

69
00:05:32.28 --> 00:05:34.28
Impro improv improv

70
00:05:34.28 --> 00:05:35.48
and

71
00:05:35.48 --> 00:05:37.96
They're hard to follow and they're hard to understand and

72
00:05:41.40 --> 00:05:46.04
You know he and he would stay down there and he would just listen and he would rock out with us this

73
00:05:47.96 --> 00:05:49.96
This old man

74
00:05:49.96 --> 00:05:51.96
And

75
00:05:51.96 --> 00:05:53.96
He

76
00:05:53.96 --> 00:05:56.52
You could see it in his face he loved it

77
00:05:59.88 --> 00:06:01.88
He loved listening to us

78
00:06:04.36 --> 00:06:07.64
And you know look his sons are all awesome musicians

79
00:06:08.44 --> 00:06:12.12
And I'm the I'm the kind of not so awesome musician

80
00:06:14.36 --> 00:06:18.20
But even the best musicians you know when you're just kind of making stuff up as you go along

81
00:06:18.20 --> 00:06:20.20
It's not gonna be

82
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.72
It's not something that's super easy to listen to and he would listen to us with no expectations no criticism

83
00:06:28.36 --> 00:06:30.84
He would enjoy it for what it was

84
00:06:35.56 --> 00:06:37.08
Which

85
00:06:37.08 --> 00:06:41.08
Which was imperfect which was off time which was maybe a little out of tune

86
00:06:41.08 --> 00:06:43.08
And

87
00:06:45.64 --> 00:06:48.28
He would listen to it with a big smile on his face

88
00:06:51.56 --> 00:06:53.56
And later it got me thinking

89
00:06:55.72 --> 00:06:57.72
About how often

90
00:06:59.88 --> 00:07:06.52
How often do we look at things that are going on around us and how often do we think if only that was a little bit different

91
00:07:06.52 --> 00:07:11.80
If only that was a little bit more in tune if only that timing was a little bit tighter if only

92
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.96
If only this had happened a little bit sooner that had happened a little bit later

93
00:07:19.24 --> 00:07:21.48
We're constantly picking apart what we see

94
00:07:28.20 --> 00:07:30.20
And that's a little lesson

95
00:07:30.20 --> 00:07:32.20
Listen

96
00:07:33.32 --> 00:07:35.32
We'll lessen I learn from the old man

97
00:07:40.52 --> 00:07:45.16
Because in the end even after eight years or 90 years or a hundred years

98
00:07:47.56 --> 00:07:50.36
One thing we're gonna still want is a little more time

99
00:07:50.36 --> 00:07:52.36
I

100
00:07:57.48 --> 00:07:59.48
Even forever is too short

101
00:08:03.08 --> 00:08:04.12
So

102
00:08:04.12 --> 00:08:08.12
Don't waste too much time wishing and hoping and wanting

103
00:08:09.48 --> 00:08:11.48
for things to be different

104
00:08:16.28 --> 00:08:18.28
Instead sometimes

105
00:08:18.28 --> 00:08:21.72
You just gotta sit back and you gotta smile

106
00:08:24.04 --> 00:08:26.04
Then you gotta enjoy the jam

107
00:08:29.56 --> 00:08:32.76
And listen to the music for what it is

108
00:08:37.88 --> 00:08:39.88
imperfect

109
00:08:40.84 --> 00:08:42.84
out of tune

110
00:08:43.96 --> 00:08:45.96
off time

111
00:08:45.96 --> 00:08:47.96
But real

112
00:08:57.48 --> 00:08:59.48
And with that

113
00:09:00.12 --> 00:09:02.12
It has been a while

114
00:09:03.48 --> 00:09:05.48
Since we've done a Q and A echo trills

115
00:09:07.16 --> 00:09:09.16
So

116
00:09:11.32 --> 00:09:13.32
Let's rock and roll

117
00:09:13.32 --> 00:09:16.52
Jam, sir what do we got Q and A

118
00:09:17.96 --> 00:09:19.000
various

119
00:09:19.24 --> 00:09:20.60
questions

120
00:09:20.60 --> 00:09:22.76
From the inner web all right first question

121
00:09:24.28 --> 00:09:29.88
Jockel I failed to understand a task that was given to me I take ownership that I didn't ask

122
00:09:30.84 --> 00:09:32.84
the right questions

123
00:09:33.80 --> 00:09:40.20
But extreme ownership applies to my boss too as she didn't make sure that I understood it correctly

124
00:09:41.32 --> 00:09:43.16
Or is that a part excuse?

125
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:45.16
Oh

126
00:09:46.28 --> 00:09:48.28
So

127
00:09:48.28 --> 00:09:50.28
Optimally

128
00:09:50.28 --> 00:09:57.16
In the world of extreme ownership everybody takes ownership and there are and I talked about this with when Dave Burke was on good

129
00:09:57.16 --> 00:09:59.16
Yes

130
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:05.64
Is that the it's interlocking fields of fire so the various people that are trying to find solutions they overlap

131
00:10:06.76 --> 00:10:12.28
And and problems get solved from two different directions so the problems get flanked when this is happening

132
00:10:12.28 --> 00:10:15.08
But we can't guarantee always that

133
00:10:15.56 --> 00:10:17.56
Everybody takes ownership

134
00:10:20.12 --> 00:10:25.56
And we can't guarantee that but that doesn't mean that we point our fingers at someone say you need to take ownership because

135
00:10:25.56 --> 00:10:31.000
As I as we know when you do that people get defensive and then they start blaming you so we avoid that what we do is

136
00:10:31.64 --> 00:10:34.60
We take ownership so what happens here in this situation?

137
00:10:34.60 --> 00:10:41.48
It here's the possible outcomes right if if you go to your boss and you say to her

138
00:10:42.52 --> 00:10:47.08
You know you didn't make sure I understood right you go cast that blame

139
00:10:49.32 --> 00:10:54.84
There's a there's a decent chance that she says well you actually didn't you actually need to pay attention

140
00:10:55.08 --> 00:10:58.84
That's not on me and if you don't understand you need to ask questions so nothing she doesn't change anything

141
00:10:58.84 --> 00:11:06.44
She hasn't changed anything and you by the way you've created a little bit of an antagonistic relationship here because you're point the finger

142
00:11:08.28 --> 00:11:10.28
So that doesn't really help

143
00:11:11.56 --> 00:11:13.56
Now here's another possible outcome

144
00:11:14.12 --> 00:11:16.28
You know you go and you say hey look I

145
00:11:16.92 --> 00:11:19.32
Failed to make sure that I

146
00:11:19.40 --> 00:11:20.76
Understood this task

147
00:11:20.76 --> 00:11:27.96
Do you mind next time if I give you a quick read back of what I think the task is to make sure that I understand it?

148
00:11:28.92 --> 00:11:36.12
Right so I'm taking full ownership like this is on me. I need to do this and now what your more likely to get in this situation is

149
00:11:36.68 --> 00:11:38.68
You know the boss to say

150
00:11:38.68 --> 00:11:40.92
You know, of course absolutely

151
00:11:41.48 --> 00:11:43.48
You know what next time

152
00:11:43.48 --> 00:11:50.12
Let me make sure I give you more detailed explanation so that you have a better understanding that's on me and all of a sudden we've got this problem

153
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Getting solved from

154
00:11:53.56 --> 00:11:55.96
Two directions now there's also a chance

155
00:11:57.72 --> 00:12:01.08
That when you say hey when you when you say something you know hey let me let me

156
00:12:02.60 --> 00:12:07.96
Let me do a read back with you you might say all that she goes yeah cool you she should do that whatever

157
00:12:08.52 --> 00:12:12.36
Pay more attention in which case right so she's not taking any ownership. She's like yeah, you should have

158
00:12:12.36 --> 00:12:19.56
Which is the big fear of people always having their head though when when I say something's my fault people go. Yeah, it is and now they wait a second

159
00:12:20.20 --> 00:12:22.68
She's supposed to work like that yes, it is

160
00:12:23.88 --> 00:12:25.56
Because

161
00:12:25.56 --> 00:12:30.36
When you take ownership of the problem and I go you know what I should have asked you question she goes yeah, you should have and you go

162
00:12:30.36 --> 00:12:35.48
Yep, exactly that's what I just said and now you ask questions and now you make sure you fully understand the task and now the problem solved

163
00:12:35.48 --> 00:12:42.44
Hmm so yeah, I think when you ask that question you had the suspicion

164
00:12:42.92 --> 00:12:44.20
What did you say?

165
00:12:44.20 --> 00:12:49.24
Is that a poor excuse so you had the suspicion that was that you were maybe perhaps

166
00:12:49.64 --> 00:12:52.28
Unfortunately making a little bit of an excuse but

167
00:12:54.60 --> 00:12:59.16
You're correct. It is a poor excuse take ownership. Hey in an ideal world

168
00:12:59.16 --> 00:13:04.84
They'll peep person above you in the chain of command takes ownership as well, but you can't you can't force them to take ownership

169
00:13:06.04 --> 00:13:09.24
So solve the problem take ownership and get it solved

170
00:13:10.68 --> 00:13:16.04
Kind of I mean kind of when you think of it do you and this actually maybe I'll follow up question

171
00:13:16.92 --> 00:13:25.000
Maybe when you think about it when you have the expectation reasonable or not the expectation that other people have to take ownership to

172
00:13:25.56 --> 00:13:27.56
Isn't that essentially

173
00:13:27.56 --> 00:13:30.20
Negating your whole extreme ownership?

174
00:13:31.32 --> 00:13:37.48
Yes, whether negates it or not. I don't know your hope is look the hope is when I say or start taking ownership

175
00:13:37.48 --> 00:13:40.04
Other people to start taking ownership as well, but I can't

176
00:13:40.60 --> 00:13:44.76
necessarily control that I can't force them to take ownership

177
00:13:45.48 --> 00:13:49.96
You know I can I can say hey that's your part of the project you should have done it. They go okay

178
00:13:49.96 --> 00:13:54.68
Well, whatever. I don't think so right that there's a me forcing ownership on you doesn't really work

179
00:13:54.68 --> 00:14:00.28
What I should do is take ownership what I hope is when I take ownership of your part of the project you go

180
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.92
Hey, Jocco you know what that's actually something that's actually my department. Let let me let me take that

181
00:14:05.16 --> 00:14:08.68
That that's something I should be running. I go. Okay cool great. So you just took ownership

182
00:14:09.24 --> 00:14:14.60
But if you don't take ownership Roger that I got it and I'm running it yeah, and the genuineness

183
00:14:15.72 --> 00:14:18.12
Where this is this was a question like that

184
00:14:18.12 --> 00:14:26.52
Kind of you get guys who get ask a lot like put you know when you know it would a lot of times be about the other person taking ownership

185
00:14:26.52 --> 00:14:28.52
Oh, right which is crazy

186
00:14:29.16 --> 00:14:35.16
But yeah, you you kind of have that hope you actually do have that hope yes, sure

187
00:14:35.56 --> 00:14:43.000
But the actual like expectation that you know where like an expectation is there that can be let down

188
00:14:43.40 --> 00:14:46.60
I can't be mad at you right when you don't take ownership look

189
00:14:46.60 --> 00:14:53.08
I guess I can't be mad at you, but it doesn't help right yeah, you know if if you were supposed to write a script for a

190
00:14:53.40 --> 00:14:57.000
For a freaking advertisement that we were gonna do for

191
00:14:58.20 --> 00:15:01.08
Whatever, I'm trying to think of something cool

192
00:15:01.72 --> 00:15:07.32
If we're gonna do an advertisement and you were supposed to write a script and then we show up and you didn't do it and I'm like you know what

193
00:15:07.80 --> 00:15:14.44
Hey, let me we'll come back tomorrow. I'll go home and write a script and you're like you what I would like you to say

194
00:15:14.44 --> 00:15:18.60
No, hey, you know what chocolate it's actually I'm supposed to write the script for this whatever. I'll do it

195
00:15:18.60 --> 00:15:22.12
And I go okay cool, but if you don't do that you go okay cool going to the script

196
00:15:22.12 --> 00:15:28.20
I I have to say okay go got it finally do some work now. What do I learn? I learn that you're really not in the game

197
00:15:28.20 --> 00:15:31.08
And now I'm probably gonna start looking for someone else's right scripts

198
00:15:31.96 --> 00:15:35.40
Which isn't you which is actually give me some good ideas

199
00:15:37.32 --> 00:15:43.24
Yeah, that genuineness though, right to with yourself. Yes, that's like if I'm just doing it

200
00:15:43.24 --> 00:15:48.76
If I'm just doing it because I'm if I'm just doing it to get echo to do it and I really don't want to take ownership of it

201
00:15:48.76 --> 00:15:52.36
Well, yeah, it's not what we're talking about. It's gonna jam you up big time

202
00:15:52.36 --> 00:15:56.04
It's gonna jam you up big time. In fact it's not just mad. Yeah, that's what I was saying

203
00:15:56.04 --> 00:16:00.84
It's kind of a step backwards really like as far as problem solving within the team kind of thing

204
00:16:00.84 --> 00:16:03.64
But yeah, you're gonna be mad and resentful so I mean

205
00:16:04.60 --> 00:16:10.12
No one's like no one's doing their work no one's taking responsibility no one's written you're essentially in the same boat

206
00:16:10.12 --> 00:16:12.12
But just one you one step behind

207
00:16:12.12 --> 00:16:17.60
You kind of like the problem is the opposite. Yeah, I mean you can take this out to the end of the grie as well

208
00:16:17.60 --> 00:16:25.40
Where I start taking ownership of so many tasks that I can't handle them all right that you can do that right and then then you go well

209
00:16:25.40 --> 00:16:27.08
You know what we're not doing this over here

210
00:16:27.24 --> 00:16:31.000
It's always why don't we get in that done cuz I don't have the capacity because here's what I'm doing

211
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.40
I'm doing these other 19 things so that 20 of thing. It's not happening now if you want to take ownership of it and make it happen cool

212
00:16:37.40 --> 00:16:40.04
You got my sport, but if not it's not happening

213
00:16:40.04 --> 00:16:42.04
Yeah, and that's okay

214
00:16:42.04 --> 00:16:48.36
Yeah, it's almost like when you kind of visualize it mentally it's like there's like levels and the extreme ownership is always on the top

215
00:16:48.68 --> 00:16:49.68
So

216
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:56.72
Certain developments can happen you can take extreme ownership and then like make certain moves and it'll jam it up even more just because of the moves

217
00:16:56.72 --> 00:16:59.96
You may not because you took extreme ownership or took responsibility

218
00:16:59.96 --> 00:17:04.36
It's cuz some moves that you made in proud solving problems, which is all natural

219
00:17:04.36 --> 00:17:08.36
But at the end of the day it is on you like you have to take responsibility

220
00:17:08.36 --> 00:17:15.36
You have to truly say I'm gonna take ownership. Yeah, and believe it so that again that genuineness to be like this is my

221
00:17:15.56 --> 00:17:22.56
Responsibility genuinely yes, it's yes, it's easy to be like the good example is when someone says well

222
00:17:22.56 --> 00:17:26.36
You know one of my subordinates made a mistake and of course, of course

223
00:17:26.36 --> 00:17:31.40
I get it just I take on the street one of the good. Yeah, but really it was there fall. Yeah, you know

224
00:17:31.40 --> 00:17:35.76
That's where it doesn't work. Yeah, and actually know what speed the next question is similar

225
00:17:35.76 --> 00:17:37.76
We should jump into the next question

226
00:17:37.76 --> 00:17:38.76
Just

227
00:17:38.76 --> 00:17:42.32
It's gonna lead us down the same path of similar conversations

228
00:17:44.64 --> 00:17:52.20
Okay, next question very similar here. It is my confusion is everyone takes ownership at what level does that end?

229
00:17:52.76 --> 00:17:57.40
theoretically the president is a commander in chief so could take extreme ownership

230
00:17:58.88 --> 00:18:00.88
Who decides who gets fired?

231
00:18:00.88 --> 00:18:06.40
How does that decision get made is that an example of extreme ownership?

232
00:18:08.40 --> 00:18:10.40
Yeah, so again, this is where we start

233
00:18:12.04 --> 00:18:17.32
Looking at what this looks like when does it stop when something goes wrong right when does it stop?

234
00:18:17.44 --> 00:18:26.32
So I was trying to apply this to my life, so with the blue on blue right that I had so Fratur side Ramadi friendly fire incident

235
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:33.44
And I took ownership of it now you got to remember also people below me in the chain of commands that knows my fault

236
00:18:33.44 --> 00:18:35.44
No, it was my fault. It was my fault

237
00:18:35.92 --> 00:18:41.000
The quote you know now you could say you could look at my boss and go well, why wouldn't you why wouldn't your be your boss's fault?

238
00:18:42.48 --> 00:18:44.48
Why wouldn't it be

239
00:18:44.48 --> 00:18:47.28
His boss's fault why wouldn't it be there?

240
00:18:47.28 --> 00:18:49.92
Why wouldn't you take that all the way up the chain of command to the president?

241
00:18:49.92 --> 00:18:58.72
I just stands who's the senior person in the military chain of command is the president and why wouldn't he say hey?

242
00:18:59.44 --> 00:19:01.84
Theoretically like that's what extreme ownership is

243
00:19:04.80 --> 00:19:06.80
Here's the deal

244
00:19:07.84 --> 00:19:10.56
The goal of extreme ownership

245
00:19:10.56 --> 00:19:20.72
It isn't just to take ownership the goal of extreme ownership is to actually solve the problem

246
00:19:21.36 --> 00:19:24.56
That's what the goal is the goal isn't to look who to blame

247
00:19:25.84 --> 00:19:27.84
The goal is to get the problem solved

248
00:19:28.56 --> 00:19:31.84
That's what the goal is it's not about just

249
00:19:32.72 --> 00:19:34.72
Blaming someone or finding someone to blame

250
00:19:34.72 --> 00:19:39.28
And when you take ownership of it

251
00:19:39.92 --> 00:19:45.36
That is the first step that leads us to solving a problem, but it's not the solution itself

252
00:19:45.36 --> 00:19:48.24
So when you say it was my fault the problem doesn't go away

253
00:19:48.88 --> 00:19:50.56
Also firing people

254
00:19:51.52 --> 00:19:55.60
Firing someone is not necessarily solve the problem

255
00:19:57.60 --> 00:19:59.20
Now unless that person

256
00:19:59.20 --> 00:20:09.68
A person in the chain of command has proven to be incompetent or immoral or incapable of doing their job or blatantly negligent if it's one of those then cool that might solve the problem

257
00:20:11.84 --> 00:20:16.96
But most likely the people just need to be led properly

258
00:20:17.68 --> 00:20:18.64
So

259
00:20:18.96 --> 00:20:23.84
So here's what happened my boss listened to me give a debrief and in the debrief yes, I took ownership

260
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.84
But I didn't just take ownership and say cool now it's gone because it didn't make the problem disappear

261
00:20:27.84 --> 00:20:35.76
I said hey here's the here's the new standard operating procedures that we are going to implement to make sure this never happens again

262
00:20:37.76 --> 00:20:41.52
Okay, so now he sees that I am solving the problem

263
00:20:42.56 --> 00:20:47.76
He sees he sees that I recognize what the problem is he sees how I'm gonna get the problem solve

264
00:20:48.16 --> 00:20:53.36
The problem is it isn't getting past me how can he take ownership but it doesn't make it past me I'm owning it

265
00:20:53.36 --> 00:21:01.12
Now a good boss is gonna say hey, you know what jockel I get it and there's definitely some I see what you're saying however

266
00:21:01.68 --> 00:21:06.48
I could have done a better job prepping you guys with training or whatever right you know and I'm not saying that was the case

267
00:21:06.48 --> 00:21:12.56
But you could you can everyone can still kind of provide overlapping field to fire to get a problem solved

268
00:21:13.68 --> 00:21:14.64
now

269
00:21:14.64 --> 00:21:16.64
Like I said

270
00:21:16.64 --> 00:21:24.80
I had taken ownership of the problem and offered the solutions if I had denied any wrongdoing and blamed other people and not come up with actual solutions

271
00:21:24.80 --> 00:21:27.76
Then he probably would have looked at me and like uh you're fired

272
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:34.64
Right because you've got someone now that's incompetent of seeing what the mistakes were incompetent of figuring out the solutions are he needs to fire me

273
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:37.36
He needs to fire me and

274
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.56
The person above him the chain of command will go hey, what happened with that fracticide he go oh yeah the the commander out there made the following mistakes

275
00:21:44.56 --> 00:21:46.88
And he's obviously incompetent my fire

276
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:54.80
Okay, Roger that that's now we have a we put a new person in there we start moving that direction but I solved the problem

277
00:21:56.24 --> 00:22:03.36
That he saw that we also right here is the solutions we're gonna to use these marking procedures going to use these time distance

278
00:22:03.36 --> 00:22:06.40
That we're gonna make sure that this does not happen again

279
00:22:06.40 --> 00:22:15.52
Now if we go back to the basic example that's one of the examples that you use in leadership strategy and tactics of a machine gunner shoot out of its feet field of fire

280
00:22:15.84 --> 00:22:17.44
Okay machine gunner shoot out of his field of fire

281
00:22:18.24 --> 00:22:21.84
Maybe the machine gunner says well, you know no one's no one told me with the field to fire work

282
00:22:22.24 --> 00:22:29.92
So it was in my fault and then maybe the fire team leader said I told him but he didn't listen so you got two excuses right and then the squad leader says well, you know the fire team

283
00:22:30.48 --> 00:22:32.48
The fire team leader didn't effectively pass the word

284
00:22:32.48 --> 00:22:36.64
So it's not my fault as a squad leader the fire team leader is not passed a word correctly

285
00:22:36.64 --> 00:22:39.76
And then a two commander says well the squad leader didn't understand the importance of field of fire

286
00:22:39.76 --> 00:22:43.76
So it's actually his fault so now we have everyone no one's solved you notice no one has solved the problem

287
00:22:44.32 --> 00:22:48.000
And then the task unit commander says you know the two leader doesn't have good control of his men

288
00:22:48.40 --> 00:22:54.72
So still no one saw the problem no one has actually implemented a solution and then a sealed team commander the next person in chain

289
00:22:54.72 --> 00:23:03.28
Command says the task unit didn't you know train themselves properly so still he's just pointing a finger doesn't it doesn't solve the problem and then the group commander says the seal team

290
00:23:03.44 --> 00:23:05.44
Commanding officers out of touch with what his troops are doing

291
00:23:06.80 --> 00:23:12.32
And then the group commander or the the admiral says you know the group commander's not paying attention to training

292
00:23:12.32 --> 00:23:18.56
So still no one has solved the problem all that's doing is blaming we're just pointing fingers and then the the the

293
00:23:18.96 --> 00:23:20.64
The so-com commander

294
00:23:20.64 --> 00:23:27.84
Looks at the admiral and says the admiral's not obviously driving realistic training, you know, and so he's just blaming and then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says

295
00:23:27.84 --> 00:23:30.64
You know obviously so-com has no standards

296
00:23:32.08 --> 00:23:37.12
But they still won't do anything and then the president says the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff doesn't understand what's happening in the field

297
00:23:38.32 --> 00:23:44.24
And then the voters say the president doesn't know how to run in the military and then the president gets voted out

298
00:23:44.24 --> 00:23:46.72
So the president eventually gets fired because of this thing

299
00:23:46.72 --> 00:23:52.16
Cute, but that's not that's not what happened so yeah, yeah, if you just passed the blame pass the blame pass the blame and no one takes ownership

300
00:23:52.16 --> 00:23:55.44
That I don't that that problem continues throughout the whole chain of command

301
00:23:56.24 --> 00:23:58.24
But when people start taking ownership

302
00:23:59.76 --> 00:24:01.84
Then the problem gets solved and it doesn't get anywhere

303
00:24:01.84 --> 00:24:09.36
There's there becomes a limitation where the problem is no longer a problem so if the if the machine gunner shoots out his field of fire and says

304
00:24:09.36 --> 00:24:14.92
You know what hey my fault next time I will confirm that I know my field of fire before pulling trigger

305
00:24:14.92 --> 00:24:18.92
So so that's kind of a solved problem

306
00:24:19.72 --> 00:24:25.72
Now it gets overlap to little bit because the fire team leaders says listen I will make sure and I'll probably perfectly clear and reinforce

307
00:24:26.44 --> 00:24:28.44
And get a readback

308
00:24:28.44 --> 00:24:32.44
Next time I tell him what it's field of fires. I'll do a better job pass and work

309
00:24:32.44 --> 00:24:35.08
So now you got like a double overlap on the problem being solved

310
00:24:35.64 --> 00:24:40.52
And then the platoon leaders says listen I didn't I should have covered fields of fire more in the rehearsals

311
00:24:40.52 --> 00:24:43.56
So now we got triple so this is not gonna be a problem anymore

312
00:24:43.56 --> 00:24:45.56
No one the fire

313
00:24:45.88 --> 00:24:50.92
You know no one to reprimand the problem is getting solved and you could go right up through the chain of command

314
00:24:50.92 --> 00:24:55.40
You know that the platoon leader says I'm gonna cover it rehearsals and the task unit commander says I'm gonna actually

315
00:24:55.72 --> 00:24:59.88
Go through a briefing on why fields of fire are so important

316
00:25:00.76 --> 00:25:06.20
And you look at all these stacks of people taking ownership the problem doesn't get out

317
00:25:06.84 --> 00:25:09.24
The problem gets soft

318
00:25:09.24 --> 00:25:16.20
So that's why a problem doesn't make its way through the entire chain of command when people start taking ownership

319
00:25:16.52 --> 00:25:18.52
It gets owned and it gets solved

320
00:25:21.32 --> 00:25:23.32
Now

321
00:25:23.32 --> 00:25:25.32
If I got a bunch of people

322
00:25:26.68 --> 00:25:30.12
That are blaming each other then maybe someone has to get fired and

323
00:25:30.84 --> 00:25:35.72
One of the platoons that I was putting through training had a bad assistant platoon commander

324
00:25:35.72 --> 00:25:42.04
And he caused the platoon to fail multiple training scenarios

325
00:25:43.72 --> 00:25:46.04
And the so every time that little

326
00:25:46.68 --> 00:25:51.64
Assistant platoon commander will get put in charge of an element he would make bad decisions and screw things up and

327
00:25:52.84 --> 00:25:54.84
Now who's fault is that

328
00:25:56.60 --> 00:25:59.80
Okay, so the assistant platoon commander he's causing the problem but his boss

329
00:25:59.80 --> 00:26:05.48
I'm barely even talking to the assistant platoon sure. I'm telling him hey, exactly you did this wrong attack. We did that wrong

330
00:26:05.48 --> 00:26:07.96
But I'm talking to platoon commander going hey, is this guy capable?

331
00:26:09.24 --> 00:26:14.84
Because he keeps making your hope tune fail now. Eventually the platoon commander has to own that

332
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:23.24
And the platoon commander who has tried to coach tried to mentor tried to you know give the guy tactical instruction and he's still not capable

333
00:26:23.24 --> 00:26:25.96
And guess what the platoon commander takes ownership and says you know what?

334
00:26:25.96 --> 00:26:29.56
Um, your fired so he took ownership of that problem

335
00:26:30.36 --> 00:26:33.96
Now does the task you to commander need to fire the platoon commander because

336
00:26:35.72 --> 00:26:41.08
Not really because there's no more problem the problem's gone and he goes okay, you know I get it you had to fire that guy

337
00:26:41.56 --> 00:26:46.76
So when you take ownership of a problem, you know, maybe it gets another layer up maybe two layers up

338
00:26:47.80 --> 00:26:48.60
but

339
00:26:48.60 --> 00:26:52.76
It it doesn't just a problem doesn't just continue

340
00:26:52.76 --> 00:26:58.36
You forever now you can have serious problems where

341
00:27:00.36 --> 00:27:06.20
Where it just continues. I mean look at watergate, right? You know there was a break in people the trust was lost and all of a sudden that problem

342
00:27:06.20 --> 00:27:09.40
When all the way up through the chain of command and the president resides

343
00:27:10.52 --> 00:27:13.48
So if it's bad enough and no one takes ownership

344
00:27:13.96 --> 00:27:19.08
You know if one of those got and and I I've free I'd have to go into the details of watergate

345
00:27:19.08 --> 00:27:23.40
But you know sometimes you see this where someone in the chain of command goes this was all on me

346
00:27:24.68 --> 00:27:28.20
And then usually people go wait a second. Are you sure are you sure your boss didn't know about this?

347
00:27:28.20 --> 00:27:32.28
Are you sure that his boss didn't know about it? And that's kind of what from what I remember about watergate

348
00:27:32.28 --> 00:27:37.24
It was you know first you got guys going to it was just us we were acting alone and then all of a sudden they figured out no

349
00:27:37.24 --> 00:27:40.04
Actually the president knew exactly what was happening and therefore

350
00:27:40.92 --> 00:27:43.32
He's you know gonna get gonna get uh

351
00:27:43.32 --> 00:27:49.64
Gonna get punished for it. Yeah, so

352
00:27:50.84 --> 00:27:58.60
Again, I think the important thing here is taking ownership is not about figuring out who you should blame

353
00:27:59.40 --> 00:28:02.28
Or who you should fire now it's you know even in extreme ownership

354
00:28:02.28 --> 00:28:07.56
I'm talking through that problem in my own head on the blue on blue. I'm saying like I'm trying to figure out who to blame

355
00:28:08.60 --> 00:28:11.48
You know and and I realize that there's one person blame. It's me

356
00:28:11.48 --> 00:28:17.48
Once I do that then it's not about like okay now I'm gonna blame myself and now we're good

357
00:28:17.48 --> 00:28:26.36
No, it's how do I solve the problem so we can win that's what ownership is and that's why you know to go and back to this original question

358
00:28:26.84 --> 00:28:29.32
When does it stop it stops when the problems get solved

359
00:28:31.80 --> 00:28:33.80
Did

360
00:28:34.92 --> 00:28:40.60
Yeah, again just one of those critical elements which actually is more important when you think about it

361
00:28:40.60 --> 00:28:45.16
The solving the problem part of it more so then it's my fault. It's their fault or whatever

362
00:28:45.40 --> 00:28:51.64
Because if we didn't have this instinctual blaming self or what he called defensive defensive magneticism yeah

363
00:28:52.28 --> 00:28:54.28
that

364
00:28:54.28 --> 00:28:58.68
It wouldn't it just be way different so but since that is a natural thing

365
00:28:58.68 --> 00:29:01.16
It's kind of like it has to be part of extreme ownership

366
00:29:01.16 --> 00:29:05.40
You know it just has to be for you to be compelled to solve the problem if you

367
00:29:06.28 --> 00:29:08.28
Believe like for real belief. Not yes

368
00:29:08.28 --> 00:29:13.16
I'm gonna if you if you if I just go ooh this was my fault and

369
00:29:14.44 --> 00:29:18.76
That's it and I don't really believe that I can solve the problem it's like there's some

370
00:29:19.80 --> 00:29:23.80
One of one of the guys at Ashland front was talking to a client the other day and

371
00:29:24.60 --> 00:29:27.88
one of the senior people when the senior executives

372
00:29:29.32 --> 00:29:35.64
Said you know oh I've got you know 1200 people that work for me. I can't be responsible for what they do

373
00:29:35.64 --> 00:29:42.04
Yeah, when they make a mistake and here's the deal when you have that attitude

374
00:29:43.08 --> 00:29:48.12
You're right you can't do anything and this goes back. You know I talked about it with Darryl Cooper on the

375
00:29:48.44 --> 00:29:53.80
Obel Grey thing if the leadership says you know what the got the people that are in the prison

376
00:29:54.20 --> 00:29:58.92
That are garden the the insurgents that were captured if they do something if they abuse those prisoners

377
00:29:58.92 --> 00:30:01.56
That's not on me that's that's somebody on the front line

378
00:30:01.56 --> 00:30:08.60
If you have that attitude then yeah, you're gonna have problems. But if you have the attitude hey what happens on front line is my responsibility?

379
00:30:08.60 --> 00:30:12.92
Then guess what you do you clarify your commanders intent you make sure that everyone understand what the rules of engage

380
00:30:12.92 --> 00:30:18.92
Marry you make sure that everyone understands what the goal of having these people in these situations are you make sure they understand

381
00:30:19.32 --> 00:30:23.40
What happens if they get caught or or yeah?

382
00:30:23.40 --> 00:30:27.40
What happens if they get caught abusing prisoners what that's gonna look like what that's gonna do the word effort

383
00:30:27.40 --> 00:30:31.000
You do all these things to mitigate that that's what you do

384
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.76
But when you think well, you know of course on responsible power really responsible

385
00:30:35.16 --> 00:30:41.56
Yeah, you don't take the actions. That's you don't take that preemptive ownership to solve those problems and then when something does go wrong

386
00:30:42.20 --> 00:30:44.92
If you throw up your hands and we will okay control what's happening on the front line

387
00:30:44.92 --> 00:30:51.24
I'm firing you immediately. I'm firing you in 10 seconds if if I if someone happens the front line and

388
00:30:52.20 --> 00:30:57.08
I talked to the leader and I say you know your your front line people did x y and z wrong

389
00:30:57.08 --> 00:31:01.40
And they go hey, you know when I can't control what's happening on the front line. I'm like cool you're fired

390
00:31:01.96 --> 00:31:04.20
You know what I mean like you if that's your attitude

391
00:31:04.20 --> 00:31:07.72
I want something to say hey you know what here's the things that I'm implementing make sure that doesn't happen again

392
00:31:07.72 --> 00:31:10.68
Here's the course I'm running here's the oversight I'm putting in here

393
00:31:10.68 --> 00:31:14.76
You know x y z to solve those problems. That's what I'm gonna do and I go okay great

394
00:31:14.92 --> 00:31:16.92
You're obviously taking ownership of the problem

395
00:31:17.64 --> 00:31:21.32
I'll take you know I'm gonna take ownership maybe I can provide you this or that to help you

396
00:31:21.32 --> 00:31:28.04
But then the once it gets there that that problem doesn't continue on indefinitely. We get it solved

397
00:31:28.04 --> 00:31:30.52
That's the beauty of extreme ownership is that the problem gets solved

398
00:31:31.80 --> 00:31:37.16
So you're so when you fire a guy or would it you know theoretically it's kind of like you're firing them because

399
00:31:37.80 --> 00:31:41.56
Like you the example you just sit right there with the guy who has that attitude right

400
00:31:41.56 --> 00:31:48.20
Oh, it'll control this you fire them because he's gonna continue to either allow or be a problem

401
00:31:48.20 --> 00:31:54.28
That's gonna continue. Yes. It's gonna continue to continue. Yeah. I think so like getting rid of him replacing whatever that and essentially solves a root of

402
00:31:54.28 --> 00:31:56.28
Of a problem. Yes bigger problem

403
00:31:56.84 --> 00:32:00.12
So what do you know because everyone's in a while you'll find it

404
00:32:00.68 --> 00:32:04.56
Situation company whatever where they'll fire guy just as punishment like

405
00:32:05.16 --> 00:32:07.16
It's not necessarily that

406
00:32:07.72 --> 00:32:09.000
Giving the circumstances

407
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.04
Particular circumstances where he'll continue to be a problem is not that kind of situation or it doesn't it's not obvious that it's that kind of situation

408
00:32:16.04 --> 00:32:23.32
But it's like we need someone's head for this mistake. You know like that kind stuff forever like how would you like?

409
00:32:23.32 --> 00:32:28.44
I don't know how would you approach take extreme ownership does not prevent you from getting fired

410
00:32:29.16 --> 00:32:31.16
We should be perfectly clear about that

411
00:32:31.64 --> 00:32:36.52
I will tell you that in my opinion you have a better chance of not getting fired if you take ownership

412
00:32:36.52 --> 00:32:40.28
Then if you put your hands up and put or point fingers at other people either you put your hands

413
00:32:40.28 --> 00:32:44.76
There was nothing I could do about that was a front lines. That's not me. I'm firing you if you say well

414
00:32:44.76 --> 00:32:50.12
It wasn't my fault it was the junior leader that directed that oh, oh, so are you gonna fire that leader?

415
00:32:50.12 --> 00:32:57.56
Are you gonna train them or you gonna do something different? Are you gonna implement some standard operating procedures that kind of happen or you just saying you can't control it because if you can't control it

416
00:32:57.56 --> 00:32:59.56
I don't need you here

417
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:04.36
So yes, sometimes people take ownership and they're getting fired anyways

418
00:33:04.60 --> 00:33:07.40
I will say this if they're proactively

419
00:33:07.80 --> 00:33:11.64
Really truly taking ownership of what is happening if they're taking preemptive ownership

420
00:33:11.64 --> 00:33:15.72
They're not gonna be sitting in that position in the first place because whatever things are unfolding they go

421
00:33:15.72 --> 00:33:19.24
Men if we could caught do in that I'm gonna be the one responsible for it

422
00:33:19.24 --> 00:33:24.68
I own this and so hey front line you can't do that here's the training

423
00:33:24.68 --> 00:33:29.48
Here's the right protocol here's the here's how you handle those situations and don't ever do that again

424
00:33:30.28 --> 00:33:33.96
And they go okay and now when the boss comes to me and says hey we have this just flare up

425
00:33:33.96 --> 00:33:38.20
I go yeah, here's what I did about it. I know I'm aware of what's happening. I already got it under wraps boss

426
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:44.04
I know okay cool thanks, but if I go well, you know all that stuff was happening and I never did anything about it

427
00:33:44.04 --> 00:33:47.16
And I didn't know about it guess what expect to get fired

428
00:33:48.04 --> 00:33:51.48
Extreme ownership does not prevent you from getting fired it's opposed to more them

429
00:33:52.04 --> 00:33:55.16
You know you caused a problem you allowed a problem to happen under your command

430
00:33:55.64 --> 00:33:58.60
You have a better chance of not getting fired if you take ownership of it

431
00:33:58.76 --> 00:34:04.52
But if you have an agreed-just thing happen and it's on your watch you might get fired

432
00:34:04.52 --> 00:34:09.40
And if you make excuses if you think you can kind of wheezele your way out of it

433
00:34:10.28 --> 00:34:14.44
Your your gut you're gonna get fired as well. You're just gonna look like a weasel

434
00:34:15.56 --> 00:34:21.000
Honey, I have this vision of the guy, you know who got gets fired right in on this way out his is

435
00:34:21.80 --> 00:34:27.40
What he called like a little basket of his stuff you know that plastic image and he's like, but I took extreme ownership

436
00:34:27.40 --> 00:34:32.12
But I took each you should have taken extreme ownership prior to this happening and look

437
00:34:32.12 --> 00:34:37.72
I actually it's funny. Okay remember to say how extreme ownership is always on the top right like no matter the problem

438
00:34:38.68 --> 00:34:40.68
Even that let's say I got fired like I got fired

439
00:34:40.68 --> 00:34:46.84
I took extreme ownership. It was my fault fully believed everything and then I got fired still right mean while I'm like mad at extreme ownership

440
00:34:46.84 --> 00:34:51.64
But took extreme ownership didn't work got fired aren't you sort of blaming extreme ownership now?

441
00:34:51.64 --> 00:34:57.48
Kind of yes, I guess it's a bit you're just strange in a strange world you are correct

442
00:34:57.48 --> 00:35:04.12
Yeah, you are you are now blaming extreme ownership but but what you're really doing is you're you're trying to take ownership after the fact

443
00:35:04.52 --> 00:35:07.40
That's why it's important to have the attitude of extreme ownership

444
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:14.04
That's the problem with in this what I wrote about leadership strategy and tactics the problem with extreme ownership

445
00:35:14.52 --> 00:35:19.72
Is that it's post mortem it's after the fact preemptive ownership is hey

446
00:35:20.28 --> 00:35:25.48
You take ownership of everything that's going on so you prevent these problems from occurring

447
00:35:25.48 --> 00:35:30.92
Yeah, now if they occur I will promise you the best thing you can do is say here's the problem

448
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:36.28
Here's the mistakes I made here's one or two fix it. That is your best method of survival

449
00:35:37.48 --> 00:35:44.76
And if you don't do that oh well if you do that it's not as I just said it's no guarantee that you're not going to get fired because you still might get fired

450
00:35:45.80 --> 00:35:47.80
But if you run in there and you make a bunch of excuses

451
00:35:48.68 --> 00:35:50.04
I mean

452
00:35:50.04 --> 00:35:52.04
Yeah, okay

453
00:35:52.68 --> 00:35:54.04
check

454
00:35:54.04 --> 00:35:55.40
Next question

455
00:35:55.40 --> 00:35:57.40
Jockel her general matters say

456
00:35:58.20 --> 00:36:02.44
That he looks for initiative and aggressiveness in NCOs

457
00:36:02.76 --> 00:36:07.32
I'm not a naturally aggressive leader do you believe leader should be aggressive by nature

458
00:36:08.36 --> 00:36:13.000
When when to be aggressive or when do you be aggressive does it come off as fake?

459
00:36:13.40 --> 00:36:15.40
If it's not natural

460
00:36:16.12 --> 00:36:22.04
So you know obviously this is something we talk about all time is that deep being default aggressive is good for leaders

461
00:36:22.04 --> 00:36:24.04
Yes, that is a true statement

462
00:36:24.04 --> 00:36:30.84
There's a dichotomy obviously because you can be too aggressive and then things go wrong and things go bad and things don't work

463
00:36:31.40 --> 00:36:36.52
And yes, there are some people that are let's say more aggressive

464
00:36:38.20 --> 00:36:40.20
by nature

465
00:36:40.20 --> 00:36:45.48
And then let's also remember that being aggressive means a lot more

466
00:36:46.44 --> 00:36:49.72
than just being loud, brash and in your face right that is the

467
00:36:49.72 --> 00:36:54.44
stereotypical thing that we think of when we think of all that guys really aggressive you think this guy's in your face

468
00:36:54.44 --> 00:36:56.76
He's yelling he's you know pushing people over

469
00:36:59.16 --> 00:37:04.76
That is not the type of aggressiveness that you need to be an effective leader

470
00:37:05.16 --> 00:37:09.24
You don't need to be allowed mouth you don't need to be brash don't need to get in people's faces

471
00:37:11.16 --> 00:37:13.64
What being aggressive means is

472
00:37:14.52 --> 00:37:16.52
Is taking action

473
00:37:16.52 --> 00:37:22.44
That's the kind of aggressiveness that I'm talking about that's the kind of aggressiveness that general matters is talking about and

474
00:37:24.84 --> 00:37:29.24
You know the definition actually wrote this down the definition of

475
00:37:30.20 --> 00:37:38.36
Aggressive or one of the definitions of being aggressive is forceful and sometimes overly assertive pursuit of ones aims

476
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:39.80
So

477
00:37:39.80 --> 00:37:46.12
First of all forceful we get right sometimes overly assertive something means sometimes that you have to go a little bit like

478
00:37:46.12 --> 00:37:50.20
Harder and here's why that's important because listen in combat

479
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:56.36
Almost nothing will happen the way you want it to if you don't force it that way

480
00:37:57.88 --> 00:38:03.96
Right you are coming against a powerful force the enemy nature time

481
00:38:03.96 --> 00:38:11.80
There's all kinds of things that that are going against you. It's a losing battle and if you don't use force of will

482
00:38:11.80 --> 00:38:18.60
Then then then you're not going to get it done you have to be aggressive and make things happen

483
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:20.60
I remember so there was a

484
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.32
There was we all got interviewed after we came home from Ramadi and

485
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:28.20
I remember I was

486
00:38:28.44 --> 00:38:35.88
Listening to Seth Stone get interviewed and it was just they were just trying to you know capture whatever information moments historical

487
00:38:35.88 --> 00:38:45.000
Accounts of what had happened in Ramadi and and Seth said something along the lines of

488
00:38:46.04 --> 00:38:51.56
Every operation we did you could feel jacco beating his head against the wall to make things happen

489
00:38:52.60 --> 00:38:54.28
And I got you know of course I laughed

490
00:38:55.40 --> 00:38:59.24
But from his perspective and it's a good perspective and it's an accurate perspective

491
00:39:00.36 --> 00:39:05.48
None of this nothing just kind of all that fell into my lap that just doesn't

492
00:39:05.48 --> 00:39:12.52
Happened it doesn't happen in combat it just doesn't happen in combat and so yes this idea that you're gonna be aggressive is

493
00:39:15.40 --> 00:39:19.32
Is is very important but if you think to yourself well, okay, okay

494
00:39:19.32 --> 00:39:25.48
Look, I'm not the type of person that likes to be allowed now likes to shout likes to yell cool good. It doesn't matter you don't need to be that way

495
00:39:26.04 --> 00:39:28.04
what it means is

496
00:39:30.68 --> 00:39:32.68
Is you need to make things happen

497
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:39.48
That's what it means and it can be this is the good thing about being aggressive sure there's there's certain parts of your nature that are aggressive

498
00:39:39.56 --> 00:39:47.56
But it can also be trained you can you can start to think with an aggressive mindset which is I am going to take action

499
00:39:47.56 --> 00:39:53.16
I'm gonna overcome obstacles. I'm gonna push through roll box. I'm not gonna take no for an answer

500
00:39:53.16 --> 00:40:02.28
And the those are things that you can train and and and how do you train them look when you when you hit an obstacle

501
00:40:02.52 --> 00:40:05.48
You look at it you you know you shake your head and you go cool

502
00:40:06.12 --> 00:40:07.88
Let's go let's figure this out

503
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:13.24
There's so often times where people they get told know where they hit an obstacle and it's game over for

504
00:40:13.56 --> 00:40:16.28
They're just done they're done training they're over it

505
00:40:17.16 --> 00:40:22.28
And you're attitude you have to go okay little little robot cool how am I gonna get through how I get you around it

506
00:40:22.28 --> 00:40:27.24
And I used to put people so to train people to be more aggressive regardless of what they're

507
00:40:27.24 --> 00:40:32.84
And believe me I had I had guys you know seal officers that were coming through that or or seal chiefs that were coming through real

508
00:40:33.40 --> 00:40:38.20
Real passive guys quiet guys, you know not type of person that you would figure oh the guys

509
00:40:38.20 --> 00:40:40.60
Oh, yeah, that guy's aggressive you wouldn't characterize him as that

510
00:40:41.72 --> 00:40:44.44
But I would put so what I would do is put them in situations where

511
00:40:45.56 --> 00:40:49.40
If they didn't make aggressive decisions to make things happen

512
00:40:49.40 --> 00:40:55.16
They were gonna get annihilated put them in training scenarios like that okay. Oh, you want to sit here and you want to wait

513
00:40:55.48 --> 00:40:59.32
Like you're getting attacked and you want to sit here and you want to know you don't make it want don't want to make a decision cool

514
00:41:00.28 --> 00:41:04.76
In 16 minutes I will have everyone in your task unit dead

515
00:41:05.72 --> 00:41:07.72
We will kill them all the paintball

516
00:41:08.12 --> 00:41:11.96
If you and then and so they learn that and I go what do you think happened? You know and it's a while

517
00:41:11.96 --> 00:41:15.08
We started to get surrounded and and I go and what did you do well? You know we

518
00:41:15.72 --> 00:41:18.28
We held position okay. How long you hold position for?

519
00:41:18.28 --> 00:41:23.08
Who we held it for a while and what did the enemy do? Well, they started maneuver and then what you do well? We held position

520
00:41:23.64 --> 00:41:26.92
And then what did the enemy do? Well, they maneuvered more and then what did you do? I held position

521
00:41:27.32 --> 00:41:32.12
And then we started taking casualties and then the enemy maneuvered and then they closed the distance and then they took us out

522
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.84
Okay, what do you think would have been better well

523
00:41:35.72 --> 00:41:38.52
Perhaps when it first started before they had us enveloped

524
00:41:38.76 --> 00:41:41.96
I could have made a maneuver to get to another building with some more high ground

525
00:41:41.96 --> 00:41:46.12
That sounds like a great idea next time. I want to treat you a little bit more aggressive and making things happen

526
00:41:46.12 --> 00:41:49.64
Okay, put them in the same scenario. They get a little bit more aggressive

527
00:41:49.80 --> 00:41:53.40
They realize that it's that it it serves its function and

528
00:41:53.96 --> 00:42:00.12
They start to develop the attitude and they start to understand what a lack of aggression will get you because that's an important thing to know

529
00:42:00.20 --> 00:42:06.52
Right, it's not just a carrot. It's a stick cool if I do if I do this aggressive thing it'll be rewarding if I don't do something aggressive

530
00:42:06.68 --> 00:42:08.68
We're gonna get annihilated

531
00:42:08.68 --> 00:42:15.80
So here's the other thing that you gotta be ready for so so if you're if you're a person that you lean towards being passive

532
00:42:15.96 --> 00:42:19.48
You've got to start to lean towards being aggressive and here's the thing that you got to remember

533
00:42:19.48 --> 00:42:22.60
You're gonna make mistakes because when you're aggressive

534
00:42:23.32 --> 00:42:26.36
You're taking more risk and often you're taking more risk now

535
00:42:28.12 --> 00:42:33.000
When you if you've played out the whole matrix of being passive versus versus being aggressive

536
00:42:33.56 --> 00:42:37.24
I will tell you that being aggressive is the one that ends up on top

537
00:42:37.24 --> 00:42:43.64
Are there but there are scenarios where your aggressiveness ends up costing you a little bit

538
00:42:43.96 --> 00:42:48.84
That absolutely happens happens happens in business and happens in life it happens on the battlefield

539
00:42:49.56 --> 00:42:51.56
but

540
00:42:51.56 --> 00:42:53.16
Overall

541
00:42:53.16 --> 00:42:58.60
Being aggressive is what this is why this is why that this is where the idea you this is where the idea of

542
00:42:59.24 --> 00:43:04.84
Aggressive has to be your default mode. This is exactly why aggression has to be your default mode

543
00:43:04.84 --> 00:43:09.56
Your default mode is aggressive if your default mode is aggressive and it's not the right answer

544
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:17.08
You just use the other answer right your default mode is aggressive that's the why I originally said to these young

545
00:43:17.08 --> 00:43:22.84
See aloftsters your default mode has to be aggressive so if you're not sure if you should stay as your go go to the default

546
00:43:22.84 --> 00:43:24.84
Which is gonna be aggressive because

547
00:43:25.32 --> 00:43:32.52
Nine times out of ten seven times out of ten eight times out of ten that's gonna be a better move than sitting on your ass and doing nothing

548
00:43:32.52 --> 00:43:38.12
That's what's gonna get your kill so your default mode is to go now. Do you always go with your default mode?

549
00:43:38.68 --> 00:43:44.12
No, you don't always go with it to default mode, but occasionally you go. Oh, you know what I'm not gonna go to default mode

550
00:43:44.12 --> 00:43:47.16
You put it you pull the setting out and you go into the other mode

551
00:43:47.16 --> 00:43:50.20
Customize it. Yeah, you customize a little bit for that particular situation

552
00:43:50.44 --> 00:43:57.80
But your default mode is I'm gonna be aggressive and that's the the odds you want the odds you want to stack the odds in your favor

553
00:43:57.80 --> 00:44:08.20
Hmm what is Jason Jason Gardner says puts it kind of a cool like good way to just really wrap your head around like being a default mode something along the lines of like

554
00:44:09.16 --> 00:44:15.08
It's easier it's better to like have to pull someone back totally then have to push them forward

555
00:44:15.08 --> 00:44:23.08
It's it's a million times easier to have to pull the reins in on someone on an element on a team on a leader on a person

556
00:44:23.08 --> 00:44:32.12
It's a million times easier to go all right. Hey, come on back. Yeah, we're going too hard. It then going hey, you need to get out there because by the way, I mean if you think about this from a

557
00:44:33.16 --> 00:44:35.16
Like an actual

558
00:44:35.16 --> 00:44:42.20
event unfolding if an event unfolds and Europe the person that's on point and you don't react to it properly

559
00:44:42.84 --> 00:44:44.36
That that

560
00:44:44.36 --> 00:44:46.60
event needs to make it through you

561
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:52.92
To me before I can now assess what I think you should do and then tell you to go do it and then kick you in the ass

562
00:44:52.92 --> 00:44:59.32
So you go do it and I'll want that we already lost yeah, I want I want you to go hey. Oh, we just got

563
00:44:59.80 --> 00:45:05.48
Disadvent started unfolding. I'm on it and you look back and you hate jockel. I'm solving this problem right now. Oh, what's the problem right

564
00:45:05.48 --> 00:45:12.44
I don't even know what the problem is yet. You already solving it. That's what I want and if I happen to occasionally have to pull the reins on you

565
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
More than happy to pull the reins on you

566
00:45:15.40 --> 00:45:17.40
What so yes that's a

567
00:45:17.40 --> 00:45:22.28
Universal it's easier to lead someone that you have to pull the reins on than you have to push

568
00:45:22.84 --> 00:45:24.84
We'd rather pull back than push forward and

569
00:45:25.72 --> 00:45:28.92
That that idea of being aggressive is

570
00:45:29.64 --> 00:45:35.48
Is part of that so I want all my I want all my subordinate leaders to be aggressive and as a leader

571
00:45:35.48 --> 00:45:41.88
I know that my subordinates are going to make mistakes while they're learning to be aggressive and even when they're being aggressive

572
00:45:41.88 --> 00:45:47.48
And I'm they're considered fully trained and fully ready. They're still gonna make mistakes

573
00:45:47.48 --> 00:45:50.68
I'm still gonna make mistakes being aggressive. I'm gonna make mistakes

574
00:45:51.08 --> 00:45:54.92
But we're gonna play the odds and the odds are

575
00:45:57.96 --> 00:46:02.92
The odds are you'd be aggressive. I'm trying to think of a good blackjack. You know, you ever play blackjack before

576
00:46:03.48 --> 00:46:05.72
Yeah, so I mean like there's you know

577
00:46:06.44 --> 00:46:08.44
dealers showing

578
00:46:08.44 --> 00:46:13.64
Whatever dealers dealers showing 20 and you're showing a 14

579
00:46:14.12 --> 00:46:17.48
Got ahead it like that that's the odds the odds are you got to hit it

580
00:46:18.92 --> 00:46:22.04
Do you are showing a 14 and you're showing a 14?

581
00:46:22.68 --> 00:46:27.16
You got to let you got to you got to hold let the dealer let the dealer take the hit do they call it

582
00:46:27.16 --> 00:46:30.92
I forget well do they call it showing 20 because you know one is down one is up. All right?

583
00:46:30.92 --> 00:46:35.32
Do they call that showing 20? Well, you have a 10 or yeah, because you don't know what the other card is

584
00:46:35.32 --> 00:46:39.08
You just assume that it's still you showing. Yes, okay, yeah

585
00:46:39.08 --> 00:46:45.16
And play blackjack in a while. I can't I can't believe I'm like struggling with my fall process around blackjack around the numbers

586
00:46:45.80 --> 00:46:47.80
That's that

587
00:46:47.80 --> 00:46:53.56
It was more of a terminology. Yeah, but you play the odds and there's rules when you're playing the odds and blackjack

588
00:46:53.56 --> 00:46:58.76
There's rules of what you hit and what you don't and you stick with the rules the odds are gonna be on your side

589
00:47:00.52 --> 00:47:03.88
Yeah, more than if you don't if you just sit back

590
00:47:03.88 --> 00:47:06.36
And that's and so we're playing the odds

591
00:47:06.76 --> 00:47:12.20
We're playing the odds with leadership and the odds are your default mode

592
00:47:12.44 --> 00:47:15.72
Not that you never come out of default mode the odds are you be aggressive

593
00:47:15.72 --> 00:47:19.72
So back to this question here. Well, let's see another couple things in this question when to be aggressive

594
00:47:19.72 --> 00:47:23.64
Look the default mode is be aggressive and sometimes you look at it. You'll know now's not the time

595
00:47:23.88 --> 00:47:27.56
Does it come off as fake or not natural? Hey, it's not

596
00:47:27.56 --> 00:47:34.36
Being aggressive from this perspective isn't how you're acting. It's the decisions that you're making

597
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.96
It's the decisions. I was working in the client yesterday and

598
00:47:38.68 --> 00:47:42.40
We were talking about data. I think it was a client call. It was another

599
00:47:43.08 --> 00:47:48.76
Yeah, it was about data and it was actually the very similar question. Hey, I'm I'm not very aggressive

600
00:47:49.08 --> 00:47:54.28
And I'm more of a data guy and I like numbers and that's how I roll and yet I'm not getting recognized and I was like cool

601
00:47:54.28 --> 00:48:00.68
Get aggressive with your data put your data together and present it up the chain of command not to say hey look at me

602
00:48:00.68 --> 00:48:02.92
But to say hey here's what's going on here's what I'm doing

603
00:48:03.32 --> 00:48:09.56
You're being aggressive with your data. You're showing them what's happening because the guy wasn't getting the recognition that he needed right?

604
00:48:09.56 --> 00:48:11.16
And he was so that meant

605
00:48:11.16 --> 00:48:13.80
His senior leadership didn't know what he was doing

606
00:48:14.04 --> 00:48:18.52
Which meant he's not getting the resources that he needs to do his job and instead of being like hey

607
00:48:18.52 --> 00:48:20.52
This is what I need because he's not an aggressive guy

608
00:48:20.52 --> 00:48:24.92
He's sitting back and just getting resources stripped away from him. I said cool your data guy

609
00:48:25.40 --> 00:48:27.40
Record the data of what you're doing

610
00:48:27.72 --> 00:48:32.68
Present it and the data let the data speak get default aggressive with your data

611
00:48:35.08 --> 00:48:40.44
That I miss anything here. Yeah, so it's not naturally. I mean, I mean if you all the sudden start to try and act

612
00:48:40.92 --> 00:48:42.12
You know this this

613
00:48:42.12 --> 00:48:45.32
Do way yeah, yeah, yeah, but I don't do that. Yeah, it's

614
00:48:46.12 --> 00:48:50.44
It's it's probably not gonna go good now. Can you do you sometimes have to learn like

615
00:48:50.44 --> 00:48:55.80
Okay, you know what I got to stand up and say something. I got to put word out, right? You know and I watched many guys in my career

616
00:48:56.20 --> 00:48:59.56
Go through the transition of being a little bit less aggressive and they realize you know what?

617
00:48:59.56 --> 00:49:04.36
I'm in charge of this thing. I got to go put the word out and and that's perfectly fine

618
00:49:05.48 --> 00:49:08.12
Yeah, those kind of for lack of a bit of some

619
00:49:08.20 --> 00:49:13.40
Superficial personality traits that are aggressive some people say oh well that's that

620
00:49:13.80 --> 00:49:16.20
Aggressive, you know where there's more depth to it

621
00:49:16.92 --> 00:49:18.92
we're like

622
00:49:18.92 --> 00:49:25.48
Again, like you know you can think of like a I don't know some fictional or maybe even not in fictional like

623
00:49:26.20 --> 00:49:28.20
Maybe Japanese

624
00:49:28.20 --> 00:49:31.08
Business tycoon who doesn't say nothing really

625
00:49:31.64 --> 00:49:35.56
You know he's making aggressive moves like that's aggressive guy. I think you know there's it goes deep

626
00:49:36.28 --> 00:49:40.92
And then you know a guy who you're saying like he yells in screams and has a loud voice or whatever

627
00:49:41.32 --> 00:49:44.28
It's kind of okay if that's your personality that's gonna land for sure

628
00:49:44.28 --> 00:49:48.52
But it's more about the decision you make if you say it's gonna land what do you mean because I might just

629
00:49:48.52 --> 00:49:52.28
Make a bunch people and grab right sometimes. Well depends on what you're yelling and screaming

630
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:59.32
Yeah, but what you're saying is there could be someone that's loud and scream but they're but they're they're using that to cover the fact that they're actually not making any moves

631
00:49:59.32 --> 00:50:04.12
Essentially, so yeah, so the yelling and screaming has very little do with aggressive movement on the battlefield

632
00:50:04.12 --> 00:50:09.000
Yes, what I'm saying this more depth to it, but the point actually is is that

633
00:50:09.64 --> 00:50:11.72
You should have just taken that point because I was a good point

634
00:50:11.72 --> 00:50:13.96
You're taking that one in the morning. I'll let you continue

635
00:50:13.96 --> 00:50:19.64
This was a fairly less glorful but nonetheless if you if because he's concerned about faking it or coming off of its thing

636
00:50:19.88 --> 00:50:26.12
Where no if your focus on those like a super-fishual elements of of your personality being aggressive

637
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:30.76
That's the part they're gonna smell is fake if you're trying to change that part. Oh, sure, you know like oh

638
00:50:30.76 --> 00:50:37.20
This probably used to have this tea in seventh grade. He's I don't know. I think it's like a music teacher. Oh, I don't know something super aggressive music teacher

639
00:50:37.20 --> 00:50:39.52
You was like a nice dude like really nice

640
00:50:39.52 --> 00:50:45.24
It's not too many stereotypical hyper aggressive music teachers. No, man. He was

641
00:50:45.96 --> 00:50:51.42
I had an assistant platoon commander and a aggressive great guy and

642
00:50:52.24 --> 00:50:58.16
He you know, I didn't you know as I got to know him you know, and I was like, so would you study in college?

643
00:50:59.16 --> 00:51:01.16
And he's like

644
00:51:01.16 --> 00:51:03.16
percussion

645
00:51:03.16 --> 00:51:09.28
I'm a we we talking about I was like what concussion what is that percussion drumming yeah?

646
00:51:09.28 --> 00:51:11.92
He started drumming in college

647
00:51:12.32 --> 00:51:17.84
Which is just kind of deep in percussion. Yeah, I didn't know you could major in percussion

648
00:51:17.84 --> 00:51:21.76
I mean I guess but anyways my history of percussion yeah

649
00:51:22.92 --> 00:51:26.28
Properties of percussion my point is had he become a music teacher

650
00:51:26.28 --> 00:51:32.60
You probably could have been a because he was a aggressive assistant platoon commander. Yeah, I had to buy had to pull the reins on him sometimes

651
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.08
We'll be out there getting after it this guy was not aggressive at all

652
00:51:36.08 --> 00:51:39.96
He was like a nice guy trying to please everyone, you know short-term and long-term kind of thing

653
00:51:39.96 --> 00:51:44.64
Which didn't really work with I'm pretty sure with seventh grade so he was like

654
00:51:44.96 --> 00:51:50.64
I remember guys we just run circles around them, you know like people wouldn't listen and all this like he had trouble controlling the class

655
00:51:50.64 --> 00:51:53.16
We'll say that and then I want one time

656
00:51:53.16 --> 00:51:58.20
He tried to switch his personality one time he dropped the book, you know how like sometimes when you drop a

657
00:51:59.20 --> 00:52:01.44
Book yeah, sometimes when he hits correctly

658
00:52:01.44 --> 00:52:05.80
It's like boom it's like a fire so one time Brad he tried to do that and it didn't

659
00:52:06.24 --> 00:52:08.44
Meet the sound and like no one

660
00:52:08.44 --> 00:52:10.28
Everyone was like what the fuck is this guy doing?

661
00:52:10.28 --> 00:52:12.80
He's like looking everybody with his eyes all big nonetheless

662
00:52:12.80 --> 00:52:19.000
I think that was like I think he got aggressive one day and people like shut up and we're like hey this guy's like

663
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.36
You know how when someone's never aggressive then they start yelling you're like everyone kind of be quiet

664
00:52:23.36 --> 00:52:28.56
Yeah, I think it's because yelling so I think he might have got a small little payoff one day and then from then on

665
00:52:28.56 --> 00:52:33.08
He started to try to be like aggressive everyone could smell it on like Brad

666
00:52:33.08 --> 00:52:37.56
That's not even your thing so he got to be a work against them. Yeah, everyone was kind of laughing at him

667
00:52:37.56 --> 00:52:41.20
Not always like a weirdo. Yeah, so no no no no need to do that

668
00:52:41.20 --> 00:52:47.48
No, we throw in the music book on the table no big text book is on the floor to yeah didn't work

669
00:52:47.48 --> 00:52:49.48
I'm for a

670
00:52:49.92 --> 00:52:54.60
Next question so this question is actually that I got one of them that I got from EF online

671
00:52:54.60 --> 00:52:57.96
So EF online you know since the big

672
00:52:59.08 --> 00:53:04.52
Lockdown in the world we've pushed a lot of resources and time and effort in the EF online

673
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:08.06
It was actually something that we were working on so it's good timing but

674
00:53:08.72 --> 00:53:10.72
EF online used to be a

675
00:53:11.60 --> 00:53:15.80
Relatively static training platform really aimed at

676
00:53:15.80 --> 00:53:21.88
Enterprise clients so big companies would train their people based on the leadership principles and

677
00:53:23.48 --> 00:53:26.80
But it's it's a powerful tool and so with

678
00:53:27.44 --> 00:53:33.32
The lockdown we've been working on a lot of our clients through webinars so what we basically we

679
00:53:34.44 --> 00:53:37.40
We've we've we've really kind of re

680
00:53:38.72 --> 00:53:43.56
Formulated reformulated and are reattacking this online

681
00:53:43.56 --> 00:53:49.36
World and so what we do so we're doing a bunch of live webinars. We're doing Q&A sessions

682
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:52.92
We got chats going on. We got we've got a forum

683
00:53:54.04 --> 00:53:59.64
So we got all kinds of things that are happening what it's doing is now it's got we got like a community of people

684
00:53:59.92 --> 00:54:07.08
That are on there all the time they're asking us questions. We're just it's just awesome and so one of the questions that I got asked was from a

685
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:12.48
From a police officer who is basically talking about he's got some complainers

686
00:54:12.48 --> 00:54:16.16
or he was talking about one complainer in particular and

687
00:54:17.36 --> 00:54:27.60
The question was what advice do you have for dealing with that one officer on your team that is the debby downner

688
00:54:28.68 --> 00:54:34.18
They complain about everything you know the one no matter what you ask the team to do that

689
00:54:34.44 --> 00:54:40.48
One guy or gal that sucks all the energy out of the room the buzzkill

690
00:54:40.48 --> 00:54:47.68
So I thought this was a a good question and I thought it was a good question because

691
00:54:49.12 --> 00:54:53.60
Everybody knows that there's a everybody knows that person so much that there's a term for it Debbie downer

692
00:54:53.60 --> 00:54:55.12
There's a

693
00:54:55.12 --> 00:55:00.52
An existing a pre-existing term for that person that's complaining and being being negative about everything

694
00:55:01.76 --> 00:55:03.76
so

695
00:55:03.76 --> 00:55:05.28
a couple and

696
00:55:05.28 --> 00:55:08.80
What's cool? What's really cool about doing this stuff online is now?

697
00:55:08.80 --> 00:55:14.000
You know right now and reading the question when I'm doing this where the person's there like we're talking face it

698
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.44
I mean, it's not face to face but it's face to face because you're on the interwebs

699
00:55:17.44 --> 00:55:21.52
And I'm looking right out the person they're looking right at me and so it's very cool

700
00:55:21.52 --> 00:55:25.80
You're having a conversation you know the one thing that's negative about this podcast is

701
00:55:26.72 --> 00:55:31.80
Well, it's us reading our best interpretation of a question through the interwebs

702
00:55:31.80 --> 00:55:34.04
When I was EF online you can

703
00:55:34.04 --> 00:55:39.48
They can clarify clarify clarify you can talk you can get details and it it makes it really

704
00:55:39.96 --> 00:55:44.28
Makes it really cool so so so back to this question Debbie downer

705
00:55:44.28 --> 00:55:45.24
So

706
00:55:45.24 --> 00:55:51.24
Leadership strategy intact. I talked about what one of the solutions that I have for a lot of different leadership problems is actually putting people in charge

707
00:55:51.80 --> 00:55:56.92
So you put somebody in charge of the of a mission of a project of a task and

708
00:55:57.16 --> 00:56:02.20
They want to complain about it cool. They can complain about themselves because they're the one that's running it

709
00:56:02.76 --> 00:56:03.96
so

710
00:56:03.96 --> 00:56:09.80
That's that's one option and that that option works a lot, right?

711
00:56:10.28 --> 00:56:12.84
Sometimes it might not work sometimes it might not be feasible

712
00:56:14.04 --> 00:56:18.36
You know you can't take maybe a junior person and put them in charge of a giant project because it's just

713
00:56:18.84 --> 00:56:20.76
You the way the

714
00:56:20.76 --> 00:56:24.68
Responsibility has been dulled out from the chain of command. You're not allowed

715
00:56:25.88 --> 00:56:27.88
To put you know private Jackson

716
00:56:27.88 --> 00:56:36.36
Sir in charge of or or private Debbie downer in charge of something so here's a note and this is another option that

717
00:56:39.16 --> 00:56:41.40
Another thing that you can do and this is a

718
00:56:42.60 --> 00:56:44.60
really incredibly brilliant solution

719
00:56:46.92 --> 00:56:48.92
Listen to them

720
00:56:49.48 --> 00:56:50.84
Right actually

721
00:56:50.84 --> 00:56:54.12
Listen to what they have to say so sometimes people complain

722
00:56:54.12 --> 00:56:56.12
I mean

723
00:56:56.68 --> 00:57:01.80
Because they complain so much no one actually ever listens to them and they just keep doing it and it has no impact

724
00:57:01.80 --> 00:57:06.44
The only impact that it has is it gives them a little good feeling because they got to put up a little protest right?

725
00:57:06.44 --> 00:57:14.76
They got to throw a little shallow negative shot at the hole at the man at the system at the mission at the ball

726
00:57:14.76 --> 00:57:19.40
They get to just throw this little complaint out and look it's it's it's kind of

727
00:57:19.40 --> 00:57:25.56
Within the rules right like you're it's no one it's it's almost bad say hey, I want to hear the complaints right?

728
00:57:26.28 --> 00:57:28.28
So you complain and you get away with it

729
00:57:29.96 --> 00:57:35.08
So so that's what they do they got to get this passive aggressive little

730
00:57:35.56 --> 00:57:40.68
Complaining going on so one thing you can do is actually listen to what they say actually say you know echo

731
00:57:41.56 --> 00:57:46.28
Actually, okay, can you meet me after this meeting? I want to actually dig down and see what you're talking about

732
00:57:46.28 --> 00:57:50.04
Hmm all of a sudden they're thrown for a loop just that right there. It's all of the problem

733
00:57:50.60 --> 00:57:54.52
And then when they comment when you talk to them actually write down what they are

734
00:57:55.56 --> 00:57:57.24
Talking about

735
00:57:57.24 --> 00:58:04.60
So those are two solution things and then you know again cuz EF online is live and I'm actually talking to the person that's asking me this question

736
00:58:06.84 --> 00:58:11.96
So you know I said well hey, what's going on? I started digging out digging into it a little bit and the complaint was

737
00:58:11.96 --> 00:58:16.52
Of was again this is a police department the complaint was about the current mission that was happening and

738
00:58:18.68 --> 00:58:23.16
The mission that they had been the mission that his squad had been in charge of had been shifted and

739
00:58:24.52 --> 00:58:27.24
This person what that's main thing that this person was complaining

740
00:58:27.24 --> 00:58:29.72
But why we doing this this should be someone else blah blah blah blah

741
00:58:29.72 --> 00:58:32.76
And you know it was a hard mission and

742
00:58:33.32 --> 00:58:38.84
Then as I'm talking to the leader the leader actually says but well, you know I didn't like the mission either

743
00:58:38.84 --> 00:58:46.04
Ha ha ha ha ha so thinking about that just think about that the leader didn't like the mission and

744
00:58:46.76 --> 00:58:53.56
One of the subordinates is complaining about it. And I'm saying of course you're gonna have complete people complaining about the mission

745
00:58:53.72 --> 00:58:55.72
You don't even like the mission

746
00:58:56.44 --> 00:58:58.44
You don't even like the mission and

747
00:58:58.76 --> 00:59:03.12
Now you're surprised that some of your subordinates are complaining and one in particular that always complaints anyways

748
00:59:03.12 --> 00:59:04.84
It's complaining about something that you don't even like

749
00:59:04.84 --> 00:59:08.66
So, you know, here's the deal.

750
00:59:08.66 --> 00:59:13.36
Like I said, talk to the complainer, write down their complaints, and then actually give

751
00:59:13.36 --> 00:59:21.08
some responses or reasons that explain why things are happening the way they are happening.

752
00:59:21.08 --> 00:59:26.80
Actually give explanations for what that individual is complaining about.

753
00:59:26.80 --> 00:59:33.40
And by the way, if you don't have good explanations, then go get them.

754
00:59:33.40 --> 00:59:36.28
So, up your chain of command and say, hey boss, here's what's going on.

755
00:59:36.28 --> 00:59:39.04
You know, this is what, this is what some of my troops are saying.

756
00:59:39.04 --> 00:59:45.64
And I agree with these parts, can we get some explanations behind this?

757
00:59:45.64 --> 00:59:50.80
So it's like when we got to her body, you're going to be working with Iraqi soldiers.

758
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:53.32
I got all kinds of complaints about that out of the gate.

759
00:59:53.32 --> 01:00:00.36
And as I've said many times before, I was the chief complainer for about three minutes.

760
01:00:00.36 --> 01:00:03.36
Before I said, okay, why are we actually doing this? Let me think about this.

761
01:00:03.36 --> 01:00:06.16
And I didn't have to ask this up in my chain of command because I figured out why we're

762
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:07.16
doing it.

763
01:00:07.16 --> 01:00:10.56
It was what we needed to do to win the war.

764
01:00:10.56 --> 01:00:12.76
And so then I was able to explain, you want to complain?

765
01:00:12.76 --> 01:00:13.76
Cool.

766
01:00:13.76 --> 01:00:14.76
I accept your complaint.

767
01:00:14.76 --> 01:00:15.76
I agreed with it a minute ago.

768
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:16.96
Here's the solution I came to.

769
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:17.96
Here's the answer.

770
01:00:17.96 --> 01:00:20.28
Here's why we're doing this.

771
01:00:20.28 --> 01:00:24.64
And all of a sudden, the complaints are going to go down.

772
01:00:24.64 --> 01:00:29.48
And then if you got people that are complaining about things, you give them the answer.

773
01:00:29.48 --> 01:00:32.08
And you'll move forward.

774
01:00:32.08 --> 01:00:36.24
That's why I don't look at complaining as a negative thing necessarily.

775
01:00:36.24 --> 01:00:38.84
And by the way, if complaining is happening and I let it continue to happen, who's fault

776
01:00:38.84 --> 01:00:39.84
that's that?

777
01:00:39.84 --> 01:00:40.84
Is it Debbie Downers fault?

778
01:00:40.84 --> 01:00:42.20
Is it?

779
01:00:42.20 --> 01:00:43.20
Guide.

780
01:00:43.20 --> 01:00:44.20
No.

781
01:00:44.20 --> 01:00:45.20
No.

782
01:00:45.20 --> 01:00:46.20
No.

783
01:00:46.20 --> 01:00:47.20
I almost just hugged the knife at you.

784
01:00:47.20 --> 01:00:48.20
Yeah, no.

785
01:00:48.20 --> 01:00:49.20
A fee feels like it.

786
01:00:49.20 --> 01:00:50.20
That's why you can't do anything.

787
01:00:50.20 --> 01:00:53.20
You can be like, oh yeah, I can't believe Debbie Downers.

788
01:00:53.20 --> 01:00:54.84
All you got to do is not complain.

789
01:00:54.84 --> 01:00:55.84
Yeah, just show them.

790
01:00:55.84 --> 01:00:56.84
Don't complain.

791
01:00:56.84 --> 01:00:57.84
No, actually, I own this.

792
01:00:57.84 --> 01:00:58.84
I support this is complaining.

793
01:00:58.84 --> 01:00:59.84
Okay, cool.

794
01:00:59.84 --> 01:01:00.84
How can I solve this?

795
01:01:00.84 --> 01:01:04.72
How about we figure out research what the complaints are about?

796
01:01:04.72 --> 01:01:11.08
And not only does it stop them from complaining, but I'm actually building relationships

797
01:01:11.08 --> 01:01:15.72
with the team because I'm being responsive to what their complaints are.

798
01:01:15.72 --> 01:01:17.84
And when I do that, I make the team tighter.

799
01:01:17.84 --> 01:01:22.32
And I make the operational capability of the team higher.

800
01:01:22.32 --> 01:01:27.32
And now we can do a better job accomplishing our mission.

801
01:01:27.32 --> 01:01:33.32
So, when you get a complainer, try listening to what the complaints are.

802
01:01:33.32 --> 01:01:35.24
You can try putting them in charge.

803
01:01:35.24 --> 01:01:39.60
You can give them explanations as to why the things they're complaining about aren't

804
01:01:39.60 --> 01:01:43.32
happening because if I got my team complaining, I'm going to assume that there's some

805
01:01:43.32 --> 01:01:44.88
validity to it.

806
01:01:44.88 --> 01:01:46.80
And if there's no validity to it, well, then cool.

807
01:01:46.80 --> 01:01:49.84
You come to me with a complaint that's completely invalid.

808
01:01:49.84 --> 01:01:54.000
And I show you, oh, yeah, here's why your complaints are valid because this is this.

809
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.44
So now you're complaining about something that is not true, right?

810
01:01:57.44 --> 01:01:59.04
You're not going to continue down that road.

811
01:01:59.04 --> 01:02:01.56
You're going to, oh, I didn't realize that boss.

812
01:02:01.56 --> 01:02:04.04
Or you're going to say, well, if that's true, it's boss and why, what about this?

813
01:02:04.04 --> 01:02:05.96
I go, okay, let me figure that one out for you.

814
01:02:05.96 --> 01:02:06.96
I'm not sure.

815
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:07.96
Yeah.

816
01:02:07.96 --> 01:02:15.000
Yeah, kind of goes along with how you'd say, like when you pull the thread, you know, like

817
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.56
the beginning of that thread is just the complaint, right?

818
01:02:17.56 --> 01:02:20.64
But when you start pulling the thread all the way out, it's kind of like, oh, shoot.

819
01:02:20.64 --> 01:02:23.12
There's some valid stuff in here.

820
01:02:23.12 --> 01:02:26.80
I don't, in a different situation, it could be that, yeah, this guy's just a complaint.

821
01:02:26.80 --> 01:02:31.72
Or this answers to all of this stuff that may be like, I don't know, it's his laziness or

822
01:02:31.72 --> 01:02:34.08
it is whatever, like all invalid complaints.

823
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:36.84
When you pull out that thread, it's like you can see that too, right?

824
01:02:36.84 --> 01:02:38.32
Yeah, there could be valid.

825
01:02:38.32 --> 01:02:39.32
It could be invalid.

826
01:02:39.32 --> 01:02:39.84
Yeah.

827
01:02:39.84 --> 01:02:42.12
Pull the thread, find the answer to that.

828
01:02:42.12 --> 01:02:43.24
That's in two and give it to.

829
01:02:43.24 --> 01:02:44.08
Yeah.

830
01:02:44.08 --> 01:02:45.08
Listening.

831
01:02:45.08 --> 01:02:48.32
The, the, the most underrated tool of leadership.

832
01:02:48.32 --> 01:02:49.32
Your ears.

833
01:02:49.32 --> 01:02:56.60
But you can kind of, I mean, it's not like, so like ludicrous though, like to dismiss a

834
01:02:56.60 --> 01:02:57.60
complainer.

835
01:02:57.60 --> 01:03:02.20
It's not that because, you know, like how you said everyone knows a Debbie downer.

836
01:03:02.20 --> 01:03:05.64
And man, after a while, the complaint can be valid or invalid.

837
01:03:05.64 --> 01:03:08.000
It's kind of like, man, you just, but you just complain so much.

838
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.60
You just dismiss a merid, you know, literally like a Debbie to iron.

839
01:03:11.60 --> 01:03:17.24
I'm thinking, but yes, but the only way to break them of that, they've gotten into that

840
01:03:17.24 --> 01:03:19.28
habit because their complaints don't have any.

841
01:03:19.28 --> 01:03:25.04
They don't have any, they don't have any outcome.

842
01:03:25.04 --> 01:03:26.16
They don't have any result.

843
01:03:26.16 --> 01:03:28.84
The only thing is, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a little, a

844
01:03:28.84 --> 01:03:30.20
little, what's that, what's that thing?

845
01:03:30.20 --> 01:03:33.96
Oh, the little dopamine hit when I say, this, this is the dumbest mission we've ever

846
01:03:33.96 --> 01:03:34.96
done.

847
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:35.96
And that's it.

848
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:36.96
It just makes me feel good.

849
01:03:36.96 --> 01:03:40.76
Everyone, you know, everyone knows that I think this is dumb.

850
01:03:40.76 --> 01:03:43.48
And now I'm just going to continue to do going through the motions of whatever,

851
01:03:43.48 --> 01:03:44.48
but I'm being negative.

852
01:03:44.48 --> 01:03:47.80
I'm driving people down, but at least I got mine.

853
01:03:47.80 --> 01:03:50.40
And the habit forms that.

854
01:03:50.40 --> 01:03:54.32
And you can break that habit when someone goes, oh, this is the dumbest mission I've

855
01:03:54.32 --> 01:03:55.32
ever seen.

856
01:03:55.32 --> 01:03:59.08
Hey, hey, what part of the mission do you think is dumb?

857
01:03:59.08 --> 01:04:04.72
Let me, what part, let me give my notebook and write this down.

858
01:04:04.72 --> 01:04:05.72
What do you got?

859
01:04:05.72 --> 01:04:10.84
You know, it's another, on EF online, I've been doing these leadership primers of

860
01:04:10.84 --> 01:04:15.32
same like, hey, here's a little thing that, here's a little thing to think about.

861
01:04:15.32 --> 01:04:21.28
But when you, when you, for the reason I use this word, leadership primer, so Hackworth

862
01:04:21.28 --> 01:04:26.84
has a book called Vietnam Primer, get people ready to, who's written in like whatever,

863
01:04:26.84 --> 01:04:28.52
60, 68.

864
01:04:28.52 --> 01:04:32.24
When guys were getting ready to go to Vietnam.

865
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:36.88
And so you wrote Vietnam Primer to give them a heads up, get them mind right, give

866
01:04:36.88 --> 01:04:41.24
them some good tips for how that, to be ready to deploy.

867
01:04:41.24 --> 01:04:42.24
Well, think about this.

868
01:04:42.24 --> 01:04:50.60
I think if you were walking to your house, and there was a bad guy in there, a criminal

869
01:04:50.60 --> 01:04:56.20
had broken in and he, and as soon as you walked in, he, he, you know, threw a punch at

870
01:04:56.20 --> 01:04:58.64
you or he ran at you or he was, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let.

871
01:04:58.64 --> 01:05:01.20
He, when you walked in, he's confronting you.

872
01:05:01.20 --> 01:05:02.20
Yeah.

873
01:05:02.20 --> 01:05:03.20
Yeah.

874
01:05:03.20 --> 01:05:08.68
Think if 10 seconds before you walked in, you got the message that said, hey, when you walk

875
01:05:08.68 --> 01:05:10.76
in here, there's a bad guy in your house.

876
01:05:10.76 --> 01:05:12.80
You would respond way better.

877
01:05:12.80 --> 01:05:13.80
Yeah.

878
01:05:13.80 --> 01:05:18.04
So the leadership primer, yeah, fault line, the leadership primer is just me saying, hey,

879
01:05:18.04 --> 01:05:20.72
here's a little something, think about today, here's a little something to put you.

880
01:05:20.72 --> 01:05:26.20
And one of the leadership primers I did the other day was get a notebook, get a notebook,

881
01:05:26.20 --> 01:05:30.68
a little notebook, keep it in your pocket when somebody tells you something, up the chain

882
01:05:30.68 --> 01:05:35.64
or down the chain of command, get out your notebook and write it now.

883
01:05:35.64 --> 01:05:39.88
You know how a, how powerful that is?

884
01:05:39.88 --> 01:05:44.16
Think of it, if you think of it from either direction, think of your my subordinate and

885
01:05:44.16 --> 01:05:46.20
you tell me something and I get out my notebook and write it down.

886
01:05:46.20 --> 01:05:47.20
What are you thinking?

887
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:48.72
Yeah, think things, get cares.

888
01:05:48.72 --> 01:05:49.72
Yep.

889
01:05:49.72 --> 01:05:52.92
Now, what if you're my boss and you say, hey, Jockel, can you take care of XYZ?

890
01:05:52.92 --> 01:05:53.92
No, no problem, sir.

891
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:55.32
And I get out my notebook and write it down.

892
01:05:55.32 --> 01:05:56.32
What do you think?

893
01:05:56.32 --> 01:05:57.32
No.

894
01:05:57.32 --> 01:06:00.80
You're initial thought is like, of course, it's positive.

895
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:02.40
I actually have to follow through.

896
01:06:02.40 --> 01:06:04.80
I can't just like take notebooks and throw them away every day.

897
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:05.80
Right?

898
01:06:05.80 --> 01:06:07.92
So you have to actually take your notes and log them down.

899
01:06:07.92 --> 01:06:11.08
But that's a little, that's a little tool that you can use.

900
01:06:11.08 --> 01:06:14.92
You wouldn't be able to, when I was in the, dams, when I was in the team, you wouldn't be able

901
01:06:14.92 --> 01:06:16.64
to find me without a notebook.

902
01:06:16.64 --> 01:06:19.16
You would not be able to find me without a notebook.

903
01:06:19.16 --> 01:06:21.12
And by the way, I have a good memory, too.

904
01:06:21.12 --> 01:06:23.36
I have a good memory, doesn't matter.

905
01:06:23.36 --> 01:06:25.08
When you tell me something, I'm gonna write it down.

906
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:29.28
Because I, A, I don't want to forget it and B, I want you to know that I got you.

907
01:06:29.28 --> 01:06:30.52
And you know what's cool?

908
01:06:30.52 --> 01:06:32.92
Three weeks goes by.

909
01:06:32.92 --> 01:06:36.16
And I go, hey, echo, you remember you asked me about this piece of gear that you thought

910
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:37.16
we should have?

911
01:06:37.16 --> 01:06:40.12
Here's the research we actually have in the order.

912
01:06:40.12 --> 01:06:41.12
You know what I'm saying?

913
01:06:41.12 --> 01:06:42.12
Boom.

914
01:06:42.12 --> 01:06:43.12
Or you're my boss.

915
01:06:43.12 --> 01:06:46.04
And I say, hey, boss, three weeks ago, you mentioned to me off the cuff.

916
01:06:46.04 --> 01:06:49.04
You said you wanted to know how many guys I had called for this thing and how many we're

917
01:06:49.04 --> 01:06:50.04
gonna have ready for deployment.

918
01:06:50.04 --> 01:06:52.88
I just want to let you know the number is 12 right now.

919
01:06:52.88 --> 01:06:56.52
And I'm gonna have a 17 when we're going to implement in the boss.

920
01:06:56.52 --> 01:06:59.32
So what does that mean?

921
01:06:59.32 --> 01:07:01.72
Does that mean I'm kissing my boss's ass and brought no?

922
01:07:01.72 --> 01:07:05.76
It means, first of all, he had a reason for asking me that in second of all, his trust

923
01:07:05.76 --> 01:07:08.20
didn't mean just went up a little bit.

924
01:07:08.20 --> 01:07:09.36
Yeah, fully.

925
01:07:09.36 --> 01:07:10.36
In both directions.

926
01:07:10.36 --> 01:07:11.36
Yeah.

927
01:07:11.36 --> 01:07:14.24
So that's the point here.

928
01:07:14.24 --> 01:07:17.80
When someone starts complaining to you, look, let's face it.

929
01:07:17.80 --> 01:07:20.64
A lot of times these complaints, they're throw away comments.

930
01:07:20.64 --> 01:07:22.28
And obviously, you're not letting get thrown away.

931
01:07:22.28 --> 01:07:23.28
Oh, yeah.

932
01:07:23.28 --> 01:07:24.92
You're getting out of the notebook.

933
01:07:24.92 --> 01:07:25.92
Yeah.

934
01:07:25.92 --> 01:07:28.80
So little leadership primer.

935
01:07:28.80 --> 01:07:30.40
Carry a notebook with you.

936
01:07:30.40 --> 01:07:31.68
Something happens right at down.

937
01:07:31.68 --> 01:07:35.08
And actually, you know, you could say, yeah, you know, you could just get out of your phone

938
01:07:35.08 --> 01:07:36.08
and go into the notes thing.

939
01:07:36.08 --> 01:07:39.24
I'm, but I kind of don't agree with that.

940
01:07:39.24 --> 01:07:42.08
Let's face it when people pull out their phone and let's go hold on.

941
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:45.28
You know, if you're going to pull out your phone and make a note in your phone, you

942
01:07:45.28 --> 01:07:46.60
got to tell them what you're doing.

943
01:07:46.60 --> 01:07:47.60
You got to say, hold on a second.

944
01:07:47.60 --> 01:07:49.04
Let me, let me write that.

945
01:07:49.04 --> 01:07:51.24
Let me put that in my notes.

946
01:07:51.24 --> 01:07:52.60
Because otherwise, they think, oh, cool.

947
01:07:52.60 --> 01:07:54.24
I'm telling him a major problem I've gotten.

948
01:07:54.24 --> 01:07:55.24
He's dead.

949
01:07:55.24 --> 01:07:56.24
He's shooting a text.

950
01:07:56.24 --> 01:07:57.24
Yeah.

951
01:07:57.24 --> 01:07:58.24
I'm getting bored.

952
01:07:58.24 --> 01:08:02.60
He's checking the ground.

953
01:08:02.60 --> 01:08:06.24
So yes, listen to your, what?

954
01:08:06.24 --> 01:08:10.76
Overall, listen, when people have complaints, listen, dig down, pull the thread.

955
01:08:10.76 --> 01:08:11.76
Put them in charge.

956
01:08:11.76 --> 01:08:12.76
That's an option.

957
01:08:12.76 --> 01:08:17.08
But also, listen, pull the thread, dig down, find the solution, find the reason and

958
01:08:17.08 --> 01:08:18.32
explain it to them.

959
01:08:18.32 --> 01:08:19.32
Yeah.

960
01:08:19.32 --> 01:08:20.32
That no taking thing.

961
01:08:20.32 --> 01:08:21.32
I can't help.

962
01:08:21.32 --> 01:08:23.04
And this is just an extreme version of it.

963
01:08:23.04 --> 01:08:29.04
So which I think you kind of like almost implied a little bit there, where, you know,

964
01:08:29.04 --> 01:08:30.04
how like on the movie?

965
01:08:30.04 --> 01:08:31.60
I don't know which one.

966
01:08:31.60 --> 01:08:36.60
You have the little, you know, you have the powerful boss walking around the little, you

967
01:08:36.60 --> 01:08:41.60
know, taking everything, writing every little thing down, you know, kind of thing.

968
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:43.60
Don't be that guy writing everything down.

969
01:08:43.60 --> 01:08:46.60
No, you know, because it's kind of like, brother, this guy's just like, you know,

970
01:08:46.60 --> 01:08:49.20
writing down positive things, right?

971
01:08:49.20 --> 01:08:50.92
Now, I guess it complains on a positive thing.

972
01:08:50.92 --> 01:08:53.12
But it's positive that you're saying, oh, wait a second, there's a problem.

973
01:08:53.12 --> 01:08:54.32
There's something you don't understand cool.

974
01:08:54.32 --> 01:08:56.12
Yeah, it's important stuff.

975
01:08:56.12 --> 01:08:57.12
Yeah.

976
01:08:57.12 --> 01:09:01.40
And it's, it almost goes back to like opening your mouth to begin with, you know, like,

977
01:09:01.40 --> 01:09:03.04
you only say important stuff.

978
01:09:03.04 --> 01:09:04.36
So just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

979
01:09:04.36 --> 01:09:08.76
I'm simply with the note taking almost kind of thing where if you're this, especially

980
01:09:08.76 --> 01:09:10.16
if you're a subordinate, right?

981
01:09:10.16 --> 01:09:13.72
We're like, oh, we're going to let me take some notes and also let me make this perfectly

982
01:09:13.72 --> 01:09:14.72
clear.

983
01:09:14.72 --> 01:09:17.92
You're not taking notes so that you can prove to them that you're listening.

984
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:21.08
No, you have to take notes so you can log down what they're saying and you can

985
01:09:21.08 --> 01:09:22.76
pull the string on it, either direction.

986
01:09:22.76 --> 01:09:23.76
Right.

987
01:09:23.76 --> 01:09:24.76
That's what you're doing.

988
01:09:24.76 --> 01:09:25.76
You're not doing it.

989
01:09:25.76 --> 01:09:26.76
So, oh, cool.

990
01:09:26.76 --> 01:09:27.76
I'm going to make a good impression.

991
01:09:27.76 --> 01:09:29.32
No, you're doing it because it's going to do a bet.

992
01:09:29.32 --> 01:09:30.76
It's going to make you do a better job.

993
01:09:30.76 --> 01:09:33.44
Because you can better support the guys above you and below you in the chain of commands

994
01:09:33.44 --> 01:09:34.44
so that we can win.

995
01:09:34.44 --> 01:09:35.44
Right.

996
01:09:35.44 --> 01:09:42.08
That's such a good point because that's that caricature in the movie who's taking notes,

997
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:44.92
you know, like the little, it's somewhat taking too many notes.

998
01:09:44.92 --> 01:09:51.40
I knew guys that were right things down and never do anything with them.

999
01:09:51.40 --> 01:09:52.40
Yeah.

1000
01:09:52.40 --> 01:09:53.40
I just want to.

1001
01:09:53.40 --> 01:09:54.80
I have less respect for you.

1002
01:09:54.80 --> 01:09:55.80
Yeah.

1003
01:09:55.80 --> 01:09:56.80
And that's what I'm saying.

1004
01:09:56.80 --> 01:09:57.80
You write it down, man.

1005
01:09:57.80 --> 01:09:58.80
I expect some action.

1006
01:09:58.80 --> 01:09:59.80
Yeah.

1007
01:09:59.80 --> 01:10:00.64
Right.

1008
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:01.64
I expect some action.

1009
01:10:01.64 --> 01:10:03.36
Oh, yeah.

1010
01:10:03.36 --> 01:10:05.36
But that's the point, right?

1011
01:10:05.36 --> 01:10:10.64
Where that's why that character exists in the movie because he's displayed and shown

1012
01:10:10.64 --> 01:10:14.08
as a kid, kiss ass guy, writing every little thing down.

1013
01:10:14.08 --> 01:10:17.68
And you could tell that's his whole intention is to be the kid that's it's like to display

1014
01:10:17.68 --> 01:10:19.28
that, you know, kind of thing.

1015
01:10:19.28 --> 01:10:21.56
Where and that's what it comes down to.

1016
01:10:21.56 --> 01:10:25.20
Like your actual intention because it's like, like, you always said, man, people can

1017
01:10:25.20 --> 01:10:26.20
smell that on you.

1018
01:10:26.20 --> 01:10:29.56
If you're like there, if you have some ulterior motive, or whatever.

1019
01:10:29.56 --> 01:10:32.40
That's what the intention has a strong smell.

1020
01:10:32.40 --> 01:10:34.68
You can quote me on that.

1021
01:10:34.68 --> 01:10:36.60
Intention has a strong smell.

1022
01:10:36.60 --> 01:10:42.52
And if you're in tension, what your intention is will be smelled by the people around

1023
01:10:42.52 --> 01:10:43.52
you.

1024
01:10:43.52 --> 01:10:44.52
Yeah.

1025
01:10:44.52 --> 01:10:45.52
And that's how it's going to look.

1026
01:10:45.52 --> 01:10:46.52
It has a look.

1027
01:10:46.52 --> 01:10:50.56
But the smell is more pungent in both directions.

1028
01:10:50.56 --> 01:10:51.88
In both directions, by the way.

1029
01:10:51.88 --> 01:10:54.88
And my intention is to take care of you.

1030
01:10:54.88 --> 01:10:57.32
That's that is felt.

1031
01:10:57.32 --> 01:10:58.68
It's smelled.

1032
01:10:58.68 --> 01:10:59.68
And it's pungent.

1033
01:10:59.68 --> 01:11:05.000
If my intention is to kiss your ass, you can smell that just as well.

1034
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.48
Smell it from a wild mile away.

1035
01:11:09.48 --> 01:11:10.48
Cool.

1036
01:11:10.48 --> 01:11:11.48
Yes.

1037
01:11:11.48 --> 01:11:12.48
Look, I agree.

1038
01:11:12.48 --> 01:11:16.48
Next question.

1039
01:11:16.48 --> 01:11:18.88
This is going to sound like a strange question.

1040
01:11:18.88 --> 01:11:23.92
But how would you advise mentally preparing for the horrors of war?

1041
01:11:23.92 --> 01:11:27.28
Like if you knew someone, you cared about what was going to be on the front lines.

1042
01:11:27.28 --> 01:11:28.64
What would you tell them?

1043
01:11:28.64 --> 01:11:34.64
I would tell them to detach.

1044
01:11:34.64 --> 01:11:37.12
I would tell them to detach.

1045
01:11:37.12 --> 01:11:39.52
I would tell them to do their job.

1046
01:11:39.52 --> 01:11:44.88
But don't get all caught up in it.

1047
01:11:44.88 --> 01:11:46.52
Because that's what you have to do.

1048
01:11:46.52 --> 01:11:50.84
If you go in the front lines and right now there's a bunch of doctors and nurses going

1049
01:11:50.84 --> 01:11:52.80
in the front lines and hospitals.

1050
01:11:52.80 --> 01:11:54.56
And that can be emotionally overwhelming.

1051
01:11:54.56 --> 01:11:56.04
Look, they do that for a living.

1052
01:11:56.04 --> 01:12:00.16
But when you see overcrowded or whatever is happening, you can see where people might

1053
01:12:00.16 --> 01:12:04.08
be overwhelmed by that or their health that risks or they're overwhelmed by that.

1054
01:12:04.08 --> 01:12:08.28
So do your job, but you've got to stay detached from it.

1055
01:12:08.28 --> 01:12:10.92
Don't get all caught up in it.

1056
01:12:10.92 --> 01:12:12.52
And also I would say I would tell them to look.

1057
01:12:12.52 --> 01:12:15.52
It's the emotions that you're going to have are okay.

1058
01:12:15.52 --> 01:12:16.52
And normal.

1059
01:12:16.52 --> 01:12:17.52
They're going to feel scared.

1060
01:12:17.52 --> 01:12:18.52
You're going to feel disgusted.

1061
01:12:18.52 --> 01:12:19.52
You're going to feel horrified.

1062
01:12:19.52 --> 01:12:20.52
You're going to feel sick.

1063
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:24.36
All those things are normal.

1064
01:12:24.36 --> 01:12:31.96
You're going to have when you are seeing this side of humanity for the first time.

1065
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:41.48
I would say I would tell them to write down and talk about what they see, what they hear,

1066
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:44.04
what they feel with other people.

1067
01:12:44.04 --> 01:12:48.56
Because if you try and keep them contained inside your own head, you won't process them

1068
01:12:48.56 --> 01:12:49.56
as well.

1069
01:12:49.56 --> 01:12:51.52
When you write things down, it forces you to think through them.

1070
01:12:51.52 --> 01:12:56.92
When you talk about other people, you get some of that out of your system.

1071
01:12:56.92 --> 01:13:00.68
So I think that's powerful.

1072
01:13:00.68 --> 01:13:02.56
Separate work from home.

1073
01:13:02.56 --> 01:13:05.32
So you're going to go in this horrible place.

1074
01:13:05.32 --> 01:13:06.40
Don't bring that home with you.

1075
01:13:06.40 --> 01:13:07.92
How do you do that?

1076
01:13:07.92 --> 01:13:08.92
Change out of your uniform.

1077
01:13:08.92 --> 01:13:11.60
Get your flip flops on.

1078
01:13:11.60 --> 01:13:14.56
Put your shorts on and your t-shirt.

1079
01:13:14.56 --> 01:13:15.56
You can home.

1080
01:13:15.56 --> 01:13:16.56
Don't wear your uniform.

1081
01:13:16.56 --> 01:13:17.56
Don't wear your police uniform.

1082
01:13:17.56 --> 01:13:19.28
Don't wear your doctors.

1083
01:13:19.28 --> 01:13:20.96
Don't wear scrubs home.

1084
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:21.96
Don't take them off.

1085
01:13:21.96 --> 01:13:24.96
Don't wear your EMT uniform home.

1086
01:13:24.96 --> 01:13:26.64
Just don't do that.

1087
01:13:26.64 --> 01:13:27.64
Change.

1088
01:13:27.64 --> 01:13:29.60
And then compartmentalize.

1089
01:13:29.60 --> 01:13:35.20
Because you got to compartmentalize these bad things.

1090
01:13:35.20 --> 01:13:39.28
And I guess maybe that could be construed in a negative way.

1091
01:13:39.28 --> 01:13:44.000
Like I'm saying lock down, you know, I'm putting me to compartment and put them away.

1092
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.28
I'm not saying that.

1093
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:47.000
I'm saying separate.

1094
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.64
Because what I'm saying, I'm not saying lock thing.

1095
01:13:49.64 --> 01:13:50.64
Put things in a box and lock them.

1096
01:13:50.64 --> 01:13:51.64
They're not saying that at all.

1097
01:13:51.64 --> 01:13:52.96
I'm actually saying the opposite.

1098
01:13:52.96 --> 01:13:53.96
Write about them.

1099
01:13:53.96 --> 01:13:54.96
Talk about them with your friends.

1100
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:57.32
Talk about what you experience, what you felt all that stuff.

1101
01:13:57.32 --> 01:14:01.44
It's going to make you feel better.

1102
01:14:01.44 --> 01:14:07.40
But keep it separate from people that don't have that experience.

1103
01:14:07.40 --> 01:14:08.40
Right?

1104
01:14:08.40 --> 01:14:13.32
So you don't want to drag home the war to your life and your kids.

1105
01:14:13.32 --> 01:14:18.20
You don't want to drag home the ER to your wife and your kids.

1106
01:14:18.20 --> 01:14:24.56
You don't want to drag home the perpetrators and the horrible things you see as a police

1107
01:14:24.56 --> 01:14:25.56
officer.

1108
01:14:25.56 --> 01:14:27.28
You don't want to drag those home every day.

1109
01:14:27.28 --> 01:14:30.36
So compartmentalize.

1110
01:14:30.36 --> 01:14:37.56
And I think those are the things that I've done that I think of help me.

1111
01:14:37.56 --> 01:14:38.72
That's true.

1112
01:14:38.72 --> 01:14:42.52
All right.

1113
01:14:42.52 --> 01:14:44.52
This next question.

1114
01:14:44.52 --> 01:14:45.92
You might have read this next question.

1115
01:14:45.92 --> 01:14:48.16
I don't mind.

1116
01:14:48.16 --> 01:14:51.000
This next question is kind of it's a good question.

1117
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.80
I think we're going to get a lot out of it.

1118
01:14:53.80 --> 01:14:56.80
But it's a little bit of a longer question.

1119
01:14:56.80 --> 01:14:58.52
And I'm going to actually end up reading it.

1120
01:14:58.52 --> 01:15:00.16
I think twice.

1121
01:15:00.16 --> 01:15:01.72
First time I'm just going to read it through.

1122
01:15:01.72 --> 01:15:02.72
Here we go.

1123
01:15:02.72 --> 01:15:05.08
I've been working on asking you this question for over a year.

1124
01:15:05.08 --> 01:15:08.92
And this is the best way I can articulate it.

1125
01:15:08.92 --> 01:15:11.36
Everything I say falls on deaf ears.

1126
01:15:11.36 --> 01:15:15.60
I try to give advice when asked or if someone is in trouble and they don't listen to the

1127
01:15:15.60 --> 01:15:17.48
sound advice.

1128
01:15:17.48 --> 01:15:21.48
And later I try to get them listen to someone else that might have more credibility and

1129
01:15:21.48 --> 01:15:24.80
author or podcaster, philosopher, etc.

1130
01:15:24.80 --> 01:15:26.92
And they still won't listen.

1131
01:15:26.92 --> 01:15:34.20
They tried their hardest to make what solutions I'm trying to give don't not apply to them

1132
01:15:34.20 --> 01:15:37.32
because of X, Y, and Z all excuses.

1133
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:42.92
Almost as if they are too good to implement the advice because it came from me and me alone.

1134
01:15:42.92 --> 01:15:48.28
And early solving people's problems and they are deliberately not listening.

1135
01:15:48.28 --> 01:15:51.04
It's not how I present the information they should use.

1136
01:15:51.04 --> 01:15:53.64
My tonality is just fine.

1137
01:15:53.64 --> 01:15:58.76
It's almost as if they won't listen because they know I'm right.

1138
01:15:58.76 --> 01:16:04.12
And I want to prove and they want to prove I'm wrong by not giving me the respect.

1139
01:16:04.12 --> 01:16:10.48
I feel the majority of people see me as lesser, not worthy of respect or listening to,

1140
01:16:10.48 --> 01:16:15.76
even though I use such obvious logic.

1141
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:22.36
These people continuously try to exercise power over me, defiantly.

1142
01:16:22.36 --> 01:16:29.16
And extreme non-influential presence, even with logic, tact, respectfulness.

1143
01:16:29.16 --> 01:16:30.84
No one wants to listen to me.

1144
01:16:30.84 --> 01:16:34.80
People just refuse to even respectfully move out of the way when I'm trying to get around

1145
01:16:34.80 --> 01:16:35.80
them.

1146
01:16:35.80 --> 01:16:36.80
Not even strangers.

1147
01:16:36.80 --> 01:16:37.80
People I live with.

1148
01:16:37.80 --> 01:16:41.52
I understand what it is about me that most people don't respect.

1149
01:16:41.52 --> 01:16:46.96
Everyone seems to have the attitude to defy or oppose everything I say.

1150
01:16:46.96 --> 01:16:53.08
No matter the circumstances, whether I'm trying my best to lead, give advice, etc.

1151
01:16:53.08 --> 01:16:54.20
People won't listen to me.

1152
01:16:54.20 --> 01:16:55.52
They won't get behind me.

1153
01:16:55.52 --> 01:16:56.92
I lack so much influence.

1154
01:16:56.92 --> 01:16:57.92
It's not funny.

1155
01:16:57.92 --> 01:16:59.96
I try but to know a veil.

1156
01:16:59.96 --> 01:17:03.16
What do you think?

1157
01:17:03.16 --> 01:17:10.64
So it's a rough situation, right?

1158
01:17:10.64 --> 01:17:14.04
I feel for the individual in that situation.

1159
01:17:14.04 --> 01:17:19.12
I imagine the frustration that you feel being in that position where you just know

1160
01:17:19.12 --> 01:17:23.84
one's listening to.

1161
01:17:23.84 --> 01:17:28.72
That being said, we have a situation here where you can see a lot of it is based on

1162
01:17:28.72 --> 01:17:32.44
everyone else's problems and not mine.

1163
01:17:32.44 --> 01:17:35.20
It starts off everything I say falls on deaf ears.

1164
01:17:35.20 --> 01:17:39.44
Even that statement right there, even that statement right there out of the gate, it's

1165
01:17:39.44 --> 01:17:41.08
not what I'm saying.

1166
01:17:41.08 --> 01:17:42.60
It's that they are deaf.

1167
01:17:42.60 --> 01:17:44.24
That right there is.

1168
01:17:44.24 --> 01:17:48.76
We're opening, opening cell, though, is you're not listening to me.

1169
01:17:48.76 --> 01:17:51.92
I try to give advice when asked or if someone is in trouble and they don't listen to

1170
01:17:51.92 --> 01:17:52.92
sound advice.

1171
01:17:52.92 --> 01:17:55.20
Again, who's fault is that?

1172
01:17:55.20 --> 01:17:59.92
I'm giving you sound advice and everyone is there not listening.

1173
01:17:59.92 --> 01:18:04.56
And then I try to get them to listen to someone else that might have more credibility

1174
01:18:04.56 --> 01:18:09.64
and author or podcast or philosopher and they still won't listen.

1175
01:18:09.64 --> 01:18:14.16
And I'm sitting there thinking myself, I wonder what that sounds like.

1176
01:18:14.16 --> 01:18:15.16
Right?

1177
01:18:15.16 --> 01:18:20.92
I imagine that it sounds something like, you know, hackworth says the exact same thing

1178
01:18:20.92 --> 01:18:22.92
as me.

1179
01:18:22.92 --> 01:18:29.04
Or you know, you might want to listen to some Sam Harris.

1180
01:18:29.04 --> 01:18:31.44
If you listen to Sam Harris, you listen to some Tim Ferriss.

1181
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:33.16
You'll see the light on this.

1182
01:18:33.16 --> 01:18:34.16
Meaning I'm over here.

1183
01:18:34.16 --> 01:18:35.16
I already see the light.

1184
01:18:35.16 --> 01:18:44.52
You might want to check out the light with me or you know, Marcus Aurelius is a good

1185
01:18:44.52 --> 01:18:48.20
reference point.

1186
01:18:48.20 --> 01:18:53.84
You know, one of the classic stoics, you might want to check him out.

1187
01:18:53.84 --> 01:18:59.88
So I feel like there's a little, you know, you're just bolstering your opinion by offering

1188
01:18:59.88 --> 01:19:04.88
other people that that you agree with.

1189
01:19:04.88 --> 01:19:07.12
And now it's supposed to give it cloud.

1190
01:19:07.12 --> 01:19:10.000
It's kind of the feeling I get, little bit.

1191
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.60
Okay, the continuing on, then they try their hardest to make what solutions I'm trying

1192
01:19:14.60 --> 01:19:19.20
to give doesn't apply to them because of XYZ all excuses.

1193
01:19:19.20 --> 01:19:23.72
And again, now instead of saying, hey, what way?

1194
01:19:23.72 --> 01:19:27.76
Am I explaining these that people have got perfect solutions allegedly?

1195
01:19:27.76 --> 01:19:28.76
What's again?

1196
01:19:28.76 --> 01:19:37.68
That's a huge, that's a huge assumption is that my solutions are freaking perfect.

1197
01:19:37.68 --> 01:19:39.08
And they just won't listen.

1198
01:19:39.08 --> 01:19:42.36
But instead of saying that, it's like, oh, maybe my solution is number one aren't that great.

1199
01:19:42.36 --> 01:19:45.84
Or number two, maybe I'm not explaining them that very well.

1200
01:19:45.84 --> 01:19:46.84
But none of this is my fault.

1201
01:19:46.84 --> 01:19:47.84
It's their fault.

1202
01:19:47.84 --> 01:19:48.84
And there's making excuses.

1203
01:19:48.84 --> 01:19:51.48
It's not on me.

1204
01:19:51.48 --> 01:19:55.000
And then it continues, almost as if they are too good to implement the advice because

1205
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.12
it came from me and me alone.

1206
01:19:58.12 --> 01:20:01.40
And this is where you start to cure that.

1207
01:20:01.40 --> 01:20:08.16
This where it starts to get a little bit of a sense of the mindset of the individual.

1208
01:20:08.16 --> 01:20:14.50
Because the individuals perception that they don't, that people don't like or people don't

1209
01:20:14.50 --> 01:20:21.44
respect them, the individual, it causes them, it causes that individual to act.

1210
01:20:21.44 --> 01:20:28.20
In ways that they, that that individual doesn't even perceive themselves.

1211
01:20:28.20 --> 01:20:31.76
So what shows through again, intent has a smell.

1212
01:20:31.76 --> 01:20:33.32
What shows through is frustration.

1213
01:20:33.32 --> 01:20:36.32
What shows through is resentment.

1214
01:20:36.32 --> 01:20:37.32
You know what I'm saying?

1215
01:20:37.32 --> 01:20:38.56
Resentment shows through.

1216
01:20:38.56 --> 01:20:40.56
You can't hide resentment.

1217
01:20:40.56 --> 01:20:45.28
Anoints when you're annoyed that people aren't listening to it shows through.

1218
01:20:45.28 --> 01:20:49.08
Erick and so when you, when you think you have the perfect solution and that's how you're

1219
01:20:49.08 --> 01:20:50.72
coming across that's how you're talking people.

1220
01:20:50.72 --> 01:20:55.48
That shows through.

1221
01:20:55.48 --> 01:21:02.88
And so all that, that perception that people don't like me, that perception that I'm,

1222
01:21:02.88 --> 01:21:09.20
that that people are looking down on me, that perception that you have of yourself shows

1223
01:21:09.20 --> 01:21:10.20
through it.

1224
01:21:10.20 --> 01:21:11.16
It comes across in a bad way.

1225
01:21:11.16 --> 01:21:16.96
The next sentence literally solving people's problems and they are deliberately

1226
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:17.96
not listening.

1227
01:21:17.96 --> 01:21:24.20
Again, none of this has to do with me, none of it has to do with my solutions themselves.

1228
01:21:24.20 --> 01:21:25.20
None of it has to do with any of that.

1229
01:21:25.20 --> 01:21:26.20
They just don't like me.

1230
01:21:26.20 --> 01:21:27.20
It's their fault.

1231
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:28.20
Yeah.

1232
01:21:28.20 --> 01:21:31.04
They don't really care about it.

1233
01:21:31.04 --> 01:21:36.96
And by the way, in doing that, we have to assume that these people are just going to fail

1234
01:21:36.96 --> 01:21:38.28
because they're not listening.

1235
01:21:38.28 --> 01:21:43.76
So I would rather fail than listen to Fred here.

1236
01:21:43.76 --> 01:21:50.12
And then this is just, it's not how I present the information they should use.

1237
01:21:50.12 --> 01:21:51.92
My tonality is just fine.

1238
01:21:51.92 --> 01:21:52.92
Right?

1239
01:21:52.92 --> 01:21:53.92
Right?

1240
01:21:53.92 --> 01:21:57.32
This is not my fault.

1241
01:21:57.32 --> 01:21:59.48
My tonality is my tonality is fine.

1242
01:21:59.48 --> 01:22:03.92
Like the way I'm presenting, look, I'm presenting this in the most beautiful way.

1243
01:22:03.92 --> 01:22:04.92
Yeah.

1244
01:22:04.92 --> 01:22:05.92
It's not a thought on me.

1245
01:22:05.92 --> 01:22:06.92
It's not my fault.

1246
01:22:06.92 --> 01:22:08.08
My tonality is actually perfect.

1247
01:22:08.08 --> 01:22:13.60
The way I present my ideas is so good.

1248
01:22:13.60 --> 01:22:14.60
It's funny.

1249
01:22:14.60 --> 01:22:17.32
I know you're exaggerating, but it's for good reason.

1250
01:22:17.32 --> 01:22:19.32
Yeah, I'm trying to make the point.

1251
01:22:19.32 --> 01:22:20.32
Yeah, exactly.

1252
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:24.84
And that's good because I'm putting myself in this shoes where I'm like, my tonality is fine.

1253
01:22:24.84 --> 01:22:27.52
What doesn't feel like when you for real believe that your tonality is fine?

1254
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:30.32
You're saying, but my tonality is fine.

1255
01:22:30.32 --> 01:22:33.24
But really what it really is, is never never really thought about it.

1256
01:22:33.24 --> 01:22:36.08
It doesn't stand out as not fine to me.

1257
01:22:36.08 --> 01:22:37.72
So it's like, yeah, my tonality is fine.

1258
01:22:37.72 --> 01:22:40.04
I'm going to include that in there just so we all know.

1259
01:22:40.04 --> 01:22:41.04
Yeah, the thing.

1260
01:22:41.04 --> 01:22:42.04
Right?

1261
01:22:42.04 --> 01:22:43.04
That's how it feels for me.

1262
01:22:43.04 --> 01:22:47.16
Theality, it's like, oh, you see it fine.

1263
01:22:47.16 --> 01:22:49.36
Just fine, because apparently not right.

1264
01:22:49.36 --> 01:22:52.92
So that's why you exaggerating it to help it stand out as a thing.

1265
01:22:52.92 --> 01:22:53.92
Yeah, I'm saying.

1266
01:22:53.92 --> 01:22:55.56
But yes, I feel it.

1267
01:22:55.56 --> 01:22:57.56
That's what I felt when it's like tonality is fine.

1268
01:22:57.56 --> 01:22:58.56
That's what I felt.

1269
01:22:58.56 --> 01:23:02.32
You might as well have said, my tonality is the most perfect tonality in the history of

1270
01:23:02.32 --> 01:23:03.32
tonality.

1271
01:23:03.32 --> 01:23:05.96
Yeah, because yeah, because that's not something that you would even think about.

1272
01:23:05.96 --> 01:23:08.36
Yeah, you just be like, as a person.

1273
01:23:08.36 --> 01:23:11.36
But you go through it and you think, you know what, the way I talk to everyone is actually

1274
01:23:11.36 --> 01:23:12.36
fine.

1275
01:23:12.36 --> 01:23:13.36
Actually, good.

1276
01:23:13.36 --> 01:23:16.20
Yeah, if it wasn't, I would know about it here.

1277
01:23:16.20 --> 01:23:18.24
I'm not clear to stand out to me.

1278
01:23:18.24 --> 01:23:20.04
Yeah, next one.

1279
01:23:20.04 --> 01:23:26.80
Next sentence, it's almost as if they won't listen to me because they know I'm right.

1280
01:23:26.80 --> 01:23:31.24
And they want to prove I'm wrong by not giving me the respect.

1281
01:23:31.24 --> 01:23:35.08
All kinds of insecurity issues right there.

1282
01:23:35.08 --> 01:23:39.000
All kinds of all kinds of insecurity and that insecurity comes across.

1283
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.92
And it doesn't come across as like, you know, echoes kind of insecure, but will listen,

1284
01:23:43.92 --> 01:23:53.56
no, it comes across as you're over compensating by a long shot.

1285
01:23:53.56 --> 01:23:59.08
And by the way, it's almost as if they won't listen to me because they know I'm right.

1286
01:23:59.08 --> 01:24:01.76
I mean, that's just crazy talk, right?

1287
01:24:01.76 --> 01:24:03.48
How many times echo trials?

1288
01:24:03.48 --> 01:24:07.80
How many times have you heard me say, I know I'm right?

1289
01:24:07.80 --> 01:24:08.80
No.

1290
01:24:08.80 --> 01:24:09.80
Zero.

1291
01:24:09.80 --> 01:24:13.36
And there's some things that I'm pretty knowledgeable about.

1292
01:24:13.36 --> 01:24:14.36
Yeah.

1293
01:24:14.36 --> 01:24:15.36
Right.

1294
01:24:15.36 --> 01:24:16.36
Yeah.

1295
01:24:16.36 --> 01:24:18.04
There's some things that I'm pretty knowledgeable about.

1296
01:24:18.04 --> 01:24:20.32
And how many times have I, and I don't know what this, I don't even know what this

1297
01:24:20.32 --> 01:24:21.96
guy does for a living.

1298
01:24:21.96 --> 01:24:30.64
But let's say maybe, well, there's no talent, but even a master of something shouldn't

1299
01:24:30.64 --> 01:24:32.80
say I know I'm right.

1300
01:24:32.80 --> 01:24:33.80
Yeah.

1301
01:24:33.80 --> 01:24:34.80
Very, very, very seldom.

1302
01:24:34.80 --> 01:24:35.80
Yeah, very seldom.

1303
01:24:35.80 --> 01:24:38.56
Man, especially that right there, I know I'm right.

1304
01:24:38.56 --> 01:24:43.08
There's a difference between, like, I know this is true or I know this.

1305
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:44.08
How about this?

1306
01:24:44.08 --> 01:24:45.44
I think this is true.

1307
01:24:45.44 --> 01:24:46.44
Oh, okay.

1308
01:24:46.44 --> 01:24:47.44
Well, I'm talking like, like, that's true.

1309
01:24:47.44 --> 01:24:48.44
And the next level.

1310
01:24:48.44 --> 01:24:49.44
Yeah.

1311
01:24:49.44 --> 01:24:50.44
Okay.

1312
01:24:50.44 --> 01:24:51.44
So, okay.

1313
01:24:51.44 --> 01:24:52.44
If you want to say.

1314
01:24:52.44 --> 01:24:53.44
Yeah.

1315
01:24:53.44 --> 01:24:56.32
If he was there, that person was there at that location.

1316
01:24:56.32 --> 01:24:57.64
Like, I know that that's true.

1317
01:24:57.64 --> 01:25:00.12
Like, that's different than saying, I know I'm right about this.

1318
01:25:00.12 --> 01:25:01.12
You know, I know I'm right.

1319
01:25:01.12 --> 01:25:02.12
I know I'm, yeah, no.

1320
01:25:02.12 --> 01:25:04.60
You have never said that.

1321
01:25:04.60 --> 01:25:08.64
Meanwhile, this guy is saying it.

1322
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:15.60
And by the way, you know, this is like starting to get into the, hey, everyone is against

1323
01:25:15.60 --> 01:25:16.60
me.

1324
01:25:16.60 --> 01:25:23.72
And not only like the whole world, everyone that I, that I deal with, they all don't listen

1325
01:25:23.72 --> 01:25:24.72
to me.

1326
01:25:24.72 --> 01:25:27.08
What is wrong with everyone else, right?

1327
01:25:27.08 --> 01:25:30.12
This isn't even like, hey, look, you and I had a little disagreement.

1328
01:25:30.12 --> 01:25:32.24
I'm going to take ownership of that and just say it's my fault.

1329
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:33.52
No, this is everyone.

1330
01:25:33.52 --> 01:25:34.52
Yeah.

1331
01:25:34.52 --> 01:25:38.36
Um, continue going.

1332
01:25:38.36 --> 01:25:44.04
I feel the majority of people see me as lesser, not worthy of respect or listening to

1333
01:25:44.04 --> 01:25:52.96
even though listening, even though I use such obvious logic.

1334
01:25:52.96 --> 01:25:56.28
Now this is where I start to feel like sympathy, right?

1335
01:25:56.28 --> 01:26:03.12
Like, because now you got this bad low self-esteem, low self-apignant.

1336
01:26:03.12 --> 01:26:09.84
And when you see yourself as lesser than you start to overcompensate for many people, start

1337
01:26:09.84 --> 01:26:12.000
to overcompensate.

1338
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.80
And you know, they start to try and act like, yeah, they start to say things like, I use

1339
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:21.60
obvious logic.

1340
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:33.08
There's a whole genre of people who like to use, that terms facts logic.

1341
01:26:33.08 --> 01:26:39.12
And so when they say, well, you don't want Jocco, look, I come at people with facts

1342
01:26:39.12 --> 01:26:42.68
and logic and sometimes it just pisses them off.

1343
01:26:42.68 --> 01:26:44.32
And what they don't, you know what I mean?

1344
01:26:44.32 --> 01:26:49.44
It's a, it's a thing that, it's one of the things that you say you refer back to a lot,

1345
01:26:49.44 --> 01:26:53.000
which is when someone says, you know, hey, I'm just that type of person just have to do it.

1346
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.84
They feel the same way about saying, look, I just deal with facts and logic.

1347
01:26:56.84 --> 01:27:01.16
And, you know, people just need to, people can't accept it.

1348
01:27:01.16 --> 01:27:07.08
And what do you can say, well, you know, lies are better or it's one of those, it's kind

1349
01:27:07.08 --> 01:27:12.40
of like you put yourself on a, in a, in a position of authority, right?

1350
01:27:12.40 --> 01:27:16.88
Listen, I like to use facts and logic as like irrefutable.

1351
01:27:16.88 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah, I use facts and logic and other people are just emotional and crazy.

1352
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.88
And obviously everyone's just listening to me.

1353
01:27:21.88 --> 01:27:25.48
So that's kind of, that's kind of a little bit of that tonality here.

1354
01:27:25.48 --> 01:27:33.32
So it continues, these people, and by the way, a people is in quotes.

1355
01:27:35.32 --> 01:27:35.92
I'm not kidding.

1356
01:27:35.92 --> 01:27:36.92
People is in quotes.

1357
01:27:36.92 --> 01:27:40.24
These people as if they're subhumans.

1358
01:27:40.24 --> 01:27:46.96
Yes, these people continuously try to exercise their power over me defiantly and

1359
01:27:46.96 --> 01:27:52.32
extreme and then it's kind of a weirdly word at sentence and extreme non-inflintial

1360
01:27:52.32 --> 01:27:56.36
presence, even with logic, tact and respectfulness.

1361
01:27:56.36 --> 01:27:58.48
So he's talking about himself.

1362
01:27:58.48 --> 01:28:00.04
No one wants to listen to me.

1363
01:28:03.88 --> 01:28:08.84
So just saying that you have tact, respectfulness and logic.

1364
01:28:08.84 --> 01:28:15.52
I mean, this is, there's no ownership about the message, about the delivery, about

1365
01:28:15.52 --> 01:28:18.56
the tonality, about the attitude, everything is everyone else's fault.

1366
01:28:19.56 --> 01:28:22.24
And by the way, like this is one of those things where if you

1367
01:28:22.24 --> 01:28:25.36
just talk about, you know, I got this one department and the two senior people in

1368
01:28:25.36 --> 01:28:26.56
department, they have a real.

1369
01:28:26.56 --> 01:28:29.80
Then you start thinking, okay, well, you know, maybe they maybe they got some ego and

1370
01:28:29.80 --> 01:28:32.16
maybe you need to massage their, you know, work through that.

1371
01:28:32.16 --> 01:28:33.84
This is everyone.

1372
01:28:33.84 --> 01:28:38.000
This is where talking about, you know, everyone that I'm interacting with doesn't

1373
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.56
listen to me, they disrespect me.

1374
01:28:43.40 --> 01:28:47.24
He continues on people just refuse to even respectfully move out of a way when I'm

1375
01:28:47.24 --> 01:28:51.24
trying to get around them, not even strangers people I live with.

1376
01:28:51.24 --> 01:28:56.88
This, this statement, first of all, why not move around other people, right?

1377
01:28:56.88 --> 01:28:57.88
That's first of all.

1378
01:28:57.88 --> 01:29:02.92
Second of all, you ever hear when someone says, oh, I was thinking about buying a

1379
01:29:02.92 --> 01:29:04.48
Corvette.

1380
01:29:04.48 --> 01:29:06.48
And now everywhere I look, I see Corvettes.

1381
01:29:06.48 --> 01:29:07.48
Yeah.

1382
01:29:07.48 --> 01:29:12.44
And this is the same thing where he feels disrespected.

1383
01:29:12.44 --> 01:29:17.08
Now, anytime anybody's in his way, it's there are straight up disrespected.

1384
01:29:17.08 --> 01:29:22.80
And hopefully it, yes, can continue on.

1385
01:29:22.80 --> 01:29:26.60
I don't understand what it is about me that most people don't respect.

1386
01:29:26.60 --> 01:29:30.88
Everyone seems to have the attitude to defy or oppose everything.

1387
01:29:30.88 --> 01:29:35.12
I say, no matter the circumstance, whether I'm trying my best to lead, give it,

1388
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:37.60
vice, etc., people won't listen to me.

1389
01:29:37.60 --> 01:29:38.92
They won't get behind me.

1390
01:29:38.92 --> 01:29:40.52
I lack so much influence.

1391
01:29:40.52 --> 01:29:41.52
It's not funny.

1392
01:29:41.52 --> 01:29:47.04
I try but to know a veil, what do you think?

1393
01:29:47.04 --> 01:29:56.60
So here's what I think to this individual.

1394
01:29:56.60 --> 01:29:58.24
Stop trying so hard.

1395
01:29:58.24 --> 01:30:01.64
Stop trying so hard to lead.

1396
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:03.88
Stop trying so hard influence.

1397
01:30:03.88 --> 01:30:09.36
Stop trying so hard to give advice to everybody.

1398
01:30:09.36 --> 01:30:14.68
Leadership starts with following people.

1399
01:30:14.68 --> 01:30:17.000
That's where leadership starts.

1400
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:28.72
I would say assessing what I'm reading that you lack real true confidence.

1401
01:30:28.72 --> 01:30:29.72
Real true confidence.

1402
01:30:29.72 --> 01:30:34.000
You have some false bravado that makes you say it's obvious and unlogical.

1403
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.32
That's not real.

1404
01:30:35.32 --> 01:30:40.84
I think you lack and the lack of confidence comes through all over this thing.

1405
01:30:40.84 --> 01:30:44.68
And so does the overcompensation.

1406
01:30:44.68 --> 01:30:48.32
So oddly enough, let me tell you something.

1407
01:30:48.32 --> 01:30:51.32
Start training GG2.

1408
01:30:51.32 --> 01:30:52.60
Strange thing to say, right?

1409
01:30:52.60 --> 01:30:55.20
Strange thing to say, start lifting weights.

1410
01:30:55.20 --> 01:30:56.20
Those are two things.

1411
01:30:56.20 --> 01:30:57.68
I'm going to say start training GG2, start lifting weights.

1412
01:30:57.68 --> 01:30:59.08
Why?

1413
01:30:59.08 --> 01:31:01.16
Because you lack confidence.

1414
01:31:01.16 --> 01:31:06.20
And those things will start to give you confidence.

1415
01:31:06.20 --> 01:31:08.80
Start listening to people.

1416
01:31:08.80 --> 01:31:14.92
Instead of always feeling like you need to give your two cents start listening to people.

1417
01:31:14.92 --> 01:31:18.04
It actually takes confidence to listen.

1418
01:31:18.04 --> 01:31:20.52
I write about that in leadership strategy and tactics.

1419
01:31:20.52 --> 01:31:24.60
It takes extreme confidence to accept other people's ideas.

1420
01:31:24.60 --> 01:31:26.68
That takes the highest level of confidence.

1421
01:31:26.68 --> 01:31:29.48
And if you don't know that then you're constantly trying to show that you don't need

1422
01:31:29.48 --> 01:31:30.48
to listen their ideas.

1423
01:31:30.48 --> 01:31:32.72
So start listening to other people.

1424
01:31:32.72 --> 01:31:38.000
Start trying to support their plans instead of trying to force your great ideas down

1425
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
everyone's thoughts.

1426
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.44
Because right now you don't have a relationship with anybody.

1427
01:31:41.44 --> 01:31:43.92
All you do is you're constantly outbound to people.

1428
01:31:43.92 --> 01:31:44.92
Do this, do that.

1429
01:31:44.92 --> 01:31:48.48
It's always about you.

1430
01:31:48.48 --> 01:31:50.32
So start following other people.

1431
01:31:50.32 --> 01:31:51.60
Start supporting other people.

1432
01:31:51.60 --> 01:31:52.60
It takes confidence.

1433
01:31:52.60 --> 01:31:54.08
It takes true confidence to follow.

1434
01:31:54.08 --> 01:31:57.12
It takes true confidence to support other people.

1435
01:31:57.12 --> 01:32:00.68
And right now you don't have that kind of confidence.

1436
01:32:00.68 --> 01:32:02.40
You don't have that kind of humility.

1437
01:32:02.40 --> 01:32:03.68
And so you act arrogant.

1438
01:32:03.68 --> 01:32:07.24
And that's that right there is probably why no one listens to you.

1439
01:32:07.24 --> 01:32:09.24
Because you act arrogant.

1440
01:32:09.24 --> 01:32:11.84
So force yourself to be humble.

1441
01:32:11.84 --> 01:32:13.24
Force yourself to listen.

1442
01:32:13.24 --> 01:32:14.40
Force yourself to follow.

1443
01:32:14.40 --> 01:32:17.48
And over time you will start to be appreciated.

1444
01:32:17.48 --> 01:32:23.12
And when people start to appreciate that you and the way you behave, then people will start

1445
01:32:23.12 --> 01:32:25.32
to listen to you.

1446
01:32:25.32 --> 01:32:27.56
And then eventually you can.

1447
01:32:27.56 --> 01:32:31.92
You will be followed by people.

1448
01:32:31.92 --> 01:32:36.92
And all that right there starts off with you taking ownership.

1449
01:32:36.92 --> 01:32:41.48
Of your shortfalls instead of blaming everyone else.

1450
01:32:41.48 --> 01:32:44.52
Because that's exactly what this whole thing is.

1451
01:32:44.52 --> 01:32:48.40
And if you want to go through life, blaming everyone else for everything that doesn't go

1452
01:32:48.40 --> 01:32:53.72
your way, then you actually have no power over it.

1453
01:32:53.72 --> 01:32:56.72
And you'll just continue in this situation forever.

1454
01:32:56.72 --> 01:33:04.04
But if you want actually take ownership of it, you can fix the shortfalls, which are yours.

1455
01:33:04.04 --> 01:33:06.88
They're your shortfalls.

1456
01:33:06.88 --> 01:33:11.44
And then you can become eventually the leader that you want to be.

1457
01:33:11.44 --> 01:33:16.36
Otherwise, you continue down this path of blaming everyone else, not changing yourself.

1458
01:33:16.36 --> 01:33:20.64
And you will continue to be not listened to, not respected.

1459
01:33:20.64 --> 01:33:25.72
Pro, this is like, this is an extreme case.

1460
01:33:25.72 --> 01:33:26.72
It's an extreme case.

1461
01:33:26.72 --> 01:33:27.72
But it's an extreme case.

1462
01:33:27.72 --> 01:33:29.88
But it's an extreme case.

1463
01:33:29.88 --> 01:33:32.72
And I really hope.

1464
01:33:32.72 --> 01:33:39.16
I mean, I truly hope that this individual is really listening.

1465
01:33:39.16 --> 01:33:42.44
Because the way that this individual feels about everyone else, it's going to be really

1466
01:33:42.44 --> 01:33:44.24
easy for me with Jockel's media.

1467
01:33:44.24 --> 01:33:45.24
Yeah.

1468
01:33:45.24 --> 01:33:46.24
Jockel's people.

1469
01:33:46.24 --> 01:33:47.24
Another one of those people.

1470
01:33:47.24 --> 01:33:48.24
People.

1471
01:33:48.24 --> 01:33:49.24
Yeah.

1472
01:33:49.24 --> 01:33:50.60
Well, listen to my logic.

1473
01:33:50.60 --> 01:33:51.60
Yeah.

1474
01:33:51.60 --> 01:33:54.80
And it makes that actually, honestly, it makes me sad.

1475
01:33:54.80 --> 01:33:56.80
It makes me sad to see someone in the state.

1476
01:33:56.80 --> 01:33:57.80
Yeah.

1477
01:33:57.80 --> 01:33:58.80
It does.

1478
01:33:58.80 --> 01:34:02.36
Well, then, and I don't want to come off like, or I'm a extreme case like I'm this like

1479
01:34:02.36 --> 01:34:06.72
expert, but I will say that, well, I think we all are in the same boat.

1480
01:34:06.72 --> 01:34:08.80
But you should say that speaking of Americans,

1481
01:34:08.80 --> 01:34:13.32
but we're all in the same boat to say we know what this is.

1482
01:34:13.32 --> 01:34:15.08
Like, we know people like this all the time.

1483
01:34:15.08 --> 01:34:16.08
Yeah.

1484
01:34:16.08 --> 01:34:17.08
Yeah.

1485
01:34:17.08 --> 01:34:23.72
As like, you know, I'm not like disparaging fitness people at all, but you ever had

1486
01:34:23.72 --> 01:34:28.52
an extreme fitness person where if you ate some bubble gum, they'd be like, you know

1487
01:34:28.52 --> 01:34:31.36
much sugars in that bubble gum, the thing is, that's all true.

1488
01:34:31.36 --> 01:34:33.72
Well, that facts, all those facts and logic.

1489
01:34:33.72 --> 01:34:37.08
You know, this stuff, oh yeah, they're not going to land them because, bro.

1490
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:38.08
Okay.

1491
01:34:38.08 --> 01:34:42.28
So I used to get into that argument, but little things with my brother were he, he

1492
01:34:42.28 --> 01:34:43.28
had everyone's one.

1493
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:48.52
He's not an extreme case, but everyone's one who'll bust out some debate stuff.

1494
01:34:48.52 --> 01:34:49.72
You know, I don't know where.

1495
01:34:49.72 --> 01:34:50.72
Right.

1496
01:34:50.72 --> 01:34:53.52
When you know how someone will say something, and they're just talking casually.

1497
01:34:53.52 --> 01:34:56.20
And then you'll be like, hey, what you said, there's no right in me, but you're all

1498
01:34:56.20 --> 01:34:57.20
this stuff, right?

1499
01:34:57.20 --> 01:34:58.20
Yeah, no one likes that.

1500
01:34:58.20 --> 01:34:59.20
No one likes that.

1501
01:34:59.20 --> 01:35:00.72
You no matter how correct, no matter.

1502
01:35:00.72 --> 01:35:05.16
So what I wound up telling them to try to sum up the whole thing, I said, what you're

1503
01:35:05.16 --> 01:35:09.08
saying is right, but what you're doing is wrong.

1504
01:35:09.08 --> 01:35:11.08
So it's like there's another level to it.

1505
01:35:11.08 --> 01:35:12.76
You know, like all this facts and logic, whatever.

1506
01:35:12.76 --> 01:35:13.96
Yeah, you told that to your brother.

1507
01:35:13.96 --> 01:35:14.96
Yes.

1508
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:18.000
Like when you, when you, you guys were in a debate of some kind?

1509
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
No.

1510
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.72
You were just giving a general sort of overview of his existence.

1511
01:35:21.72 --> 01:35:26.28
I was scolding him for getting people into debates all the time.

1512
01:35:26.28 --> 01:35:29.48
You know, like if you mean you were talking to his listening, and like there was this

1513
01:35:29.48 --> 01:35:32.56
time, I think this is what prompted it.

1514
01:35:32.56 --> 01:35:37.04
Where me and Terry were, and we were just talking about kids, you know, just kind of raising

1515
01:35:37.04 --> 01:35:40.32
kids and we're like doing this and this and he was sort of listening and kind of in the

1516
01:35:40.32 --> 01:35:41.96
conversation, but I was talking to him.

1517
01:35:41.96 --> 01:35:44.76
And he was, and we were talking about something.

1518
01:35:44.76 --> 01:35:48.16
I forget exactly what it was, but something about like, oh, if you do this, this will

1519
01:35:48.16 --> 01:35:50.44
create this response with a kid.

1520
01:35:50.44 --> 01:35:53.80
And then we're like, what if it had the reverse response or whatever?

1521
01:35:53.80 --> 01:35:58.44
And then he chimed in with something like, oh no, it would have this initial response.

1522
01:35:58.44 --> 01:36:02.80
And I'm like, well, but you could stand a reason that they might respond like this.

1523
01:36:02.80 --> 01:36:06.36
You know, kind of just talking, no, like, isn't it interesting, kind of thing?

1524
01:36:06.36 --> 01:36:09.28
And then meanwhile, I'm talking to Terry by the way.

1525
01:36:09.28 --> 01:36:12.16
And facilitating Jade's comments, but I'm more talking to Terry.

1526
01:36:12.16 --> 01:36:15.88
And then he interrupting, because no, no, there's studies about this and that.

1527
01:36:15.88 --> 01:36:19.64
And then everyone's kind of like, pausing was like, oh, these things really aggressive

1528
01:36:19.64 --> 01:36:20.64
right now.

1529
01:36:20.64 --> 01:36:21.64
He even said afterwards.

1530
01:36:21.64 --> 01:36:22.64
He's like, no, I'm sorry.

1531
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:23.64
I came off whatever.

1532
01:36:23.64 --> 01:36:24.64
He likes to do that.

1533
01:36:24.64 --> 01:36:25.64
Oh, yeah, big time.

1534
01:36:25.64 --> 01:36:28.12
And that's why I wound up when I say scolding.

1535
01:36:28.12 --> 01:36:29.12
It's like, brother, it's your brother.

1536
01:36:29.12 --> 01:36:30.16
So it's not even scolding.

1537
01:36:30.16 --> 01:36:35.12
But in the last, it's, yeah, like, what you're saying, regardless of what it is, like,

1538
01:36:35.12 --> 01:36:41.56
if you, if you have all these, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, logic, irrefutable logic and facts

1539
01:36:41.56 --> 01:36:43.96
and all this stuff, like, brother, that's all correct.

1540
01:36:43.96 --> 01:36:45.36
But what you're doing is wrong.

1541
01:36:45.36 --> 01:36:51.24
Well, what, what, just one thing that really bothers me about this is I actually know

1542
01:36:51.24 --> 01:36:55.04
100%, which I just talked about not saying.

1543
01:36:55.04 --> 01:36:59.80
I know that an individual in this situation can turn it around.

1544
01:36:59.80 --> 01:37:03.08
Yeah, so I thought that would be a good turn around.

1545
01:37:03.08 --> 01:37:04.08
Yeah.

1546
01:37:04.08 --> 01:37:08.52
There's a, in leadership strategy and tactics, I have a second called conform to influence.

1547
01:37:08.52 --> 01:37:14.40
And it just talks about like, hey, basically what you just said, you know, when the fitness

1548
01:37:14.40 --> 01:37:19.64
person's like, hey, you should work out every day at four o'clock in the morning.

1549
01:37:19.64 --> 01:37:23.44
And people are like, hey, dude, I'm not going to listen to you because you're barking at

1550
01:37:23.44 --> 01:37:24.44
me.

1551
01:37:24.44 --> 01:37:25.44
Yeah.

1552
01:37:25.44 --> 01:37:29.56
You know, I had this question at the master in Australia from the female that was like,

1553
01:37:29.56 --> 01:37:31.56
hey, I love health.

1554
01:37:31.56 --> 01:37:32.56
I care about health.

1555
01:37:32.56 --> 01:37:33.56
I'm working out every morning.

1556
01:37:33.56 --> 01:37:34.96
I'm trying to get everyone motivated.

1557
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:37.28
I'm telling them that they shouldn't be eating what they're eating for lunch.

1558
01:37:37.28 --> 01:37:39.40
I'm telling them they should come work out with me afterwards.

1559
01:37:39.40 --> 01:37:41.000
And she's basically not part of the crew.

1560
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Yeah.

1561
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.52
They're all just looking at her thinking, just be quiet.

1562
01:37:44.52 --> 01:37:48.64
And I said, why don't you form some relationships with the people so that they start to

1563
01:37:48.64 --> 01:37:49.64
listen to you.

1564
01:37:49.64 --> 01:37:56.88
That's another kind of overlying to our underlying tone here is you don't have relationships

1565
01:37:56.88 --> 01:37:57.88
with anybody.

1566
01:37:57.88 --> 01:37:59.88
Why are they going to listen to anything that you say?

1567
01:37:59.88 --> 01:38:00.88
Yeah.

1568
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:01.88
Form relationships with people.

1569
01:38:01.88 --> 01:38:02.88
How do you do that?

1570
01:38:02.88 --> 01:38:03.88
You listen to them.

1571
01:38:03.88 --> 01:38:04.88
You follow them.

1572
01:38:04.88 --> 01:38:05.88
You support them.

1573
01:38:05.88 --> 01:38:06.88
Yeah.

1574
01:38:06.88 --> 01:38:11.48
That is like you say that you can recover from it and that, yeah.

1575
01:38:11.48 --> 01:38:13.72
But it's not going to be the next day, man.

1576
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:14.72
It's in fact.

1577
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:15.72
I don't know.

1578
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72
Yeah, yeah.

1579
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:16.72
For sure.

1580
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.72
He's got a little campaign.

1581
01:38:17.72 --> 01:38:18.72
He's got a campaign.

1582
01:38:18.72 --> 01:38:19.72
Yeah.

1583
01:38:19.72 --> 01:38:24.48
Because the same way that you look at the Corvette thing that you did and you're always

1584
01:38:24.48 --> 01:38:26.20
seeing the Corvette everywhere.

1585
01:38:26.20 --> 01:38:28.20
And so it's like this kind of pattern of thought, right?

1586
01:38:28.20 --> 01:38:31.56
Where now he looks at everyone as like, oh, I just can't wait.

1587
01:38:31.56 --> 01:38:35.56
It's almost like he's waiting for them anticipating them to respect them or whatever.

1588
01:38:35.56 --> 01:38:36.56
And that's just how.

1589
01:38:36.56 --> 01:38:38.76
But it's a two-way street.

1590
01:38:38.76 --> 01:38:41.40
People are not waiting for him to say some BS to them now.

1591
01:38:41.40 --> 01:38:44.48
He's going to roll in the room and people are like, here comes whatever.

1592
01:38:44.48 --> 01:38:45.48
Love this crap.

1593
01:38:45.48 --> 01:38:48.04
Let me throw high promises at you.

1594
01:38:48.04 --> 01:38:52.80
The reason I think it might be a little not as hard as you think it would be is because

1595
01:38:52.80 --> 01:38:59.000
I bet people don't really have these horrible feelings about them.

1596
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.20
I bet they're just kind of like, you know what I mean?

1597
01:39:01.20 --> 01:39:02.20
Yeah.

1598
01:39:02.20 --> 01:39:03.20
It's kind of like, oh, yeah.

1599
01:39:03.20 --> 01:39:06.24
Like, when they say, oh, you know, when they say to them, I don't think we're

1600
01:39:06.24 --> 01:39:07.96
going to do it that way.

1601
01:39:07.96 --> 01:39:09.68
He's thinking, she, they don't listen.

1602
01:39:09.68 --> 01:39:12.56
And they're really just thinking, well, it seems like there's a problem with that.

1603
01:39:12.56 --> 01:39:15.000
You know, whether it seems like that be a little logistically complicated.

1604
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.24
And he doesn't hear that.

1605
01:39:16.24 --> 01:39:19.000
He just hears, they hate me and they don't listen to me.

1606
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.000
That is possible.

1607
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.20
So it might not be, you know, I get asked sometimes, you know, well, I'm a female.

1608
01:39:27.20 --> 01:39:29.60
And the guys are thinking, that's her, I'm a man.

1609
01:39:29.60 --> 01:39:30.60
I'm working on these women.

1610
01:39:30.60 --> 01:39:31.60
They're thinking that.

1611
01:39:31.60 --> 01:39:34.88
And I go, you know, probably it's thinking the most about being a man in that room.

1612
01:39:34.88 --> 01:39:35.88
You.

1613
01:39:35.88 --> 01:39:38.12
You know, it's probably thinking the most about being a woman.

1614
01:39:38.12 --> 01:39:44.28
You know, I've been taught, I've had female leaders come and brief me over and over again.

1615
01:39:44.28 --> 01:39:46.08
And I'm not thinking, oh, it's a woman.

1616
01:39:46.08 --> 01:39:47.92
I'm going to see it from this perspective.

1617
01:39:47.92 --> 01:39:49.52
No, are there some people that do that?

1618
01:39:49.52 --> 01:39:50.52
Sure.

1619
01:39:50.52 --> 01:39:53.08
But most people are like, oh, what's what is she talking about?

1620
01:39:53.08 --> 01:39:54.08
Yeah.

1621
01:39:54.08 --> 01:39:58.20
So there's a good chance that some of this is just in his head.

1622
01:39:58.20 --> 01:39:59.96
It's some of it is just in his head.

1623
01:39:59.96 --> 01:40:03.000
And the person that's thinking about this the most is actually him.

1624
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Yeah.

1625
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
It's possible.

1626
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:10.80
It's also possible that, well, I, this, this much I can promise you.

1627
01:40:10.80 --> 01:40:15.96
These people are not going home and thinking about him all night.

1628
01:40:15.96 --> 01:40:17.44
I can promise you that's not happening.

1629
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:18.44
Maybe two of them are.

1630
01:40:18.44 --> 01:40:19.44
Yeah.

1631
01:40:19.44 --> 01:40:21.32
But he's going home and thinking about them all day all night.

1632
01:40:21.32 --> 01:40:24.000
He's thinking about how much they disrespect him, how much they're not thinking about

1633
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
that.

1634
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.000
They don't move out of his way.

1635
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:31.08
Somebody, you know, he walks down the hallway and wants to get into the freaking refrigerator

1636
01:40:31.08 --> 01:40:32.72
room.

1637
01:40:32.72 --> 01:40:34.08
And someone's in the way.

1638
01:40:34.08 --> 01:40:38.52
And, and, you know, they kind of like, like, go first.

1639
01:40:38.52 --> 01:40:39.52
Yeah.

1640
01:40:39.52 --> 01:40:41.72
They never think about that moment again.

1641
01:40:41.72 --> 01:40:44.04
He's dwelling on it.

1642
01:40:44.04 --> 01:40:45.04
Don't dwell on it, man.

1643
01:40:45.04 --> 01:40:46.64
No one's thinking about it.

1644
01:40:46.64 --> 01:40:47.92
Just be, this be cool.

1645
01:40:47.92 --> 01:40:48.92
Listen, other people.

1646
01:40:48.92 --> 01:40:49.92
Be humble.

1647
01:40:49.92 --> 01:40:51.56
That's rough, too.

1648
01:40:51.56 --> 01:40:56.32
Like, if that's in your mind, like, people just won't even get out of my way when I'm trying

1649
01:40:56.32 --> 01:41:00.76
to go around them, like, well, bro, that's like some sensitive, like, bro, that's where

1650
01:41:00.76 --> 01:41:02.44
you're finding this, the, right, you're finding Corvette.

1651
01:41:02.44 --> 01:41:03.44
You're finding Corvette.

1652
01:41:03.44 --> 01:41:04.44
You're finding Corvette.

1653
01:41:04.44 --> 01:41:06.28
Everywhere you look is a Corvette.

1654
01:41:06.28 --> 01:41:10.04
Even Corvette's that aren't Corvette's start looking like Corvette's.

1655
01:41:10.04 --> 01:41:11.04
You know what I'm saying?

1656
01:41:11.04 --> 01:41:14.04
You start seeing, you know, ferocious.

1657
01:41:14.04 --> 01:41:17.24
I'm looking like, yes, unfortunately.

1658
01:41:17.24 --> 01:41:19.96
You start looking like a Corvette.

1659
01:41:19.96 --> 01:41:20.96
Yeah.

1660
01:41:20.96 --> 01:41:31.96
Brother, and yeah, the, to me, as far as me goes, that's true, but at the same time, everyone

1661
01:41:31.96 --> 01:41:33.48
could know this about this guy.

1662
01:41:33.48 --> 01:41:38.84
Everyone could have this like notion of this guy that this is who this guy is or any.

1663
01:41:38.84 --> 01:41:40.56
He's so annoying.

1664
01:41:40.56 --> 01:41:45.12
Every little thing that I do, he has some advice to make it different or better, you

1665
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:49.12
know, like, even those guys, you don't think about them when they're not there.

1666
01:41:49.12 --> 01:41:54.24
Well, yeah, yeah, even those guys, yeah, when they show up, you're like, oh, here comes

1667
01:41:54.24 --> 01:41:55.24
Billy.

1668
01:41:55.24 --> 01:41:56.24
Yeah, with this.

1669
01:41:56.24 --> 01:41:57.80
And somebody named Bill, by the way, hit me up on social media.

1670
01:41:57.80 --> 01:41:59.88
It's where I was all the bad guys named Bill.

1671
01:41:59.88 --> 01:42:05.36
Okay, so let's say, Darren, you know, you got, you got little Darren coming in

1672
01:42:05.36 --> 01:42:07.24
you go, here's Darren with his wild mouth.

1673
01:42:07.24 --> 01:42:08.24
Oh, yeah.

1674
01:42:08.24 --> 01:42:09.24
He's got his own ideas.

1675
01:42:09.24 --> 01:42:10.24
Yeah.

1676
01:42:10.24 --> 01:42:11.24
He leaves, I'm not thinking about Darren.

1677
01:42:11.24 --> 01:42:12.24
It's not driving me crazy.

1678
01:42:12.24 --> 01:42:13.24
I'm not writing.

1679
01:42:13.24 --> 01:42:14.24
I'm not taking a year.

1680
01:42:14.24 --> 01:42:19.000
He took a year to formulate this email, a year to form this.

1681
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.76
So he's thinking about this all the time for a year to try and articulate it the right

1682
01:42:23.76 --> 01:42:27.84
way, which by the way, according to him, he did.

1683
01:42:27.84 --> 01:42:29.84
He did articulated the right way.

1684
01:42:29.84 --> 01:42:35.68
He says, I've been working on asking you this question for over a year and this is the

1685
01:42:35.68 --> 01:42:38.76
best way I think I can articulate it.

1686
01:42:38.76 --> 01:42:39.76
This is it.

1687
01:42:39.76 --> 01:42:40.76
That's the best way.

1688
01:42:40.76 --> 01:42:41.76
Yeah.

1689
01:42:41.76 --> 01:42:42.76
Yeah, man.

1690
01:42:42.76 --> 01:42:43.76
It's hard.

1691
01:42:43.76 --> 01:42:45.64
Okay, so there's this.

1692
01:42:45.64 --> 01:42:48.04
I thought you were going to comment, at least on the fact that I told him to start training

1693
01:42:48.04 --> 01:42:49.04
in GJ2.

1694
01:42:49.04 --> 01:42:50.04
Yeah, what?

1695
01:42:50.04 --> 01:42:51.04
But I have nothing to add.

1696
01:42:51.04 --> 01:42:52.04
Yes, sir.

1697
01:42:52.04 --> 01:42:54.04
It's a real thing.

1698
01:42:54.04 --> 01:42:55.04
Real thing.

1699
01:42:55.04 --> 01:42:56.04
Help yourself confidence.

1700
01:42:56.04 --> 01:42:57.04
Yeah.

1701
01:42:57.04 --> 01:42:58.68
Hang around with some other people.

1702
01:42:58.68 --> 01:42:59.68
Get choked out.

1703
01:42:59.68 --> 01:43:00.68
Get choked.

1704
01:43:00.68 --> 01:43:01.68
Get armed locked.

1705
01:43:01.68 --> 01:43:02.68
So lifting weights.

1706
01:43:02.68 --> 01:43:04.16
Yeah, and maybe you're getting in shape.

1707
01:43:04.16 --> 01:43:08.84
Maybe one of those results, one of the many results of that might be, but you won't be compelled

1708
01:43:08.84 --> 01:43:09.84
to try to correct everybody.

1709
01:43:09.84 --> 01:43:15.44
Everyone where you go, you're like, okay, so sometimes like, I want to say all the time,

1710
01:43:15.44 --> 01:43:20.04
if people aren't asking for like advice, not all the time, sometimes it works.

1711
01:43:20.04 --> 01:43:24.20
But if they're not asking for advice, he can't just just well, solicited, be correct.

1712
01:43:24.20 --> 01:43:25.20
And people.

1713
01:43:25.20 --> 01:43:29.08
How often are you walking around just standing by and hoping that everyone gives you advice

1714
01:43:29.08 --> 01:43:30.08
on stuff?

1715
01:43:30.08 --> 01:43:31.08
There's not a lot of people like that.

1716
01:43:31.08 --> 01:43:32.68
Yeah, I mean, it's really rare.

1717
01:43:32.68 --> 01:43:35.40
But there is a time, okay, back to my brother, J.

1718
01:43:35.40 --> 01:43:38.84
You stuck in sand with his truck.

1719
01:43:38.84 --> 01:43:40.24
I'm quite.

1720
01:43:40.24 --> 01:43:44.84
So he wasn't stuck stuck, but he was getting stuck.

1721
01:43:44.84 --> 01:43:45.84
And we could all see him.

1722
01:43:45.84 --> 01:43:47.64
He was kind of in the distance there.

1723
01:43:47.64 --> 01:43:49.36
And he started, it started to get stuck.

1724
01:43:49.36 --> 01:43:51.96
And there's all kinds of techniques to get on stuck in sand.

1725
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:53.32
All kinds of techniques, right?

1726
01:43:53.32 --> 01:43:56.48
But there's a protocol, it's pretty standard or whatever.

1727
01:43:56.48 --> 01:44:00.84
So he's beginning to get stuck in our other friend, Richard, who is he the most tactful

1728
01:44:00.84 --> 01:44:01.84
guy in the world.

1729
01:44:01.84 --> 01:44:03.20
Sounds like a man.

1730
01:44:03.20 --> 01:44:06.48
Every single moment of his life, maybe not.

1731
01:44:06.48 --> 01:44:08.68
And then at this particular moment, it wasn't.

1732
01:44:08.68 --> 01:44:12.98
So I see Richard walking over there about to go give J.

1733
01:44:12.98 --> 01:44:15.12
Some advice on how to not get stuck.

1734
01:44:15.12 --> 01:44:16.12
Right?

1735
01:44:16.12 --> 01:44:18.60
Is he qualified to give advice and his J.

1736
01:44:18.60 --> 01:44:21.36
Should J be taking advice at this point?

1737
01:44:21.36 --> 01:44:23.44
Okay, well, that's another question.

1738
01:44:23.44 --> 01:44:28.72
To me, if you're about to get stuck, if it really seems like you're about to get stuck,

1739
01:44:28.72 --> 01:44:30.84
and someone's going to offer you advice to not get stuck.

1740
01:44:30.84 --> 01:44:32.44
Yeah, I think logically.

1741
01:44:32.44 --> 01:44:33.44
Right?

1742
01:44:33.44 --> 01:44:34.44
You should take the advice.

1743
01:44:34.44 --> 01:44:36.28
But we're dealing with the real world here.

1744
01:44:36.28 --> 01:44:37.68
So J is about to get stuck.

1745
01:44:37.68 --> 01:44:40.12
J has a protocol in his mind.

1746
01:44:40.12 --> 01:44:42.60
He's not like unaware of this protocol.

1747
01:44:42.60 --> 01:44:43.60
But he has it in his mind.

1748
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:48.68
But according to what seemed like what it looked like was in Richard's mind, he didn't.

1749
01:44:48.68 --> 01:44:53.52
So Richard's aggressively running over there, aggressively going over there to give him some

1750
01:44:53.52 --> 01:44:55.16
unsolicited advice.

1751
01:44:55.16 --> 01:44:57.44
Which he obviously needs.

1752
01:44:57.44 --> 01:44:58.44
Right?

1753
01:44:58.44 --> 01:45:00.20
And we can hear any of the advice.

1754
01:45:00.20 --> 01:45:01.20
You can't hear it.

1755
01:45:01.20 --> 01:45:02.80
We only see the body movements.

1756
01:45:02.80 --> 01:45:03.80
Right?

1757
01:45:03.80 --> 01:45:08.24
So you see aggressively, Richard's telling him what every is telling him with his hand movements

1758
01:45:08.24 --> 01:45:09.24
and all this stuff.

1759
01:45:09.24 --> 01:45:11.24
You know, J is like no reaction.

1760
01:45:11.24 --> 01:45:13.96
You know, the kind of when you're really annoyed, but you have no reaction.

1761
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:15.56
You're just like kind of looking down on whatever.

1762
01:45:15.56 --> 01:45:17.28
And he's like doing his own protocol.

1763
01:45:17.28 --> 01:45:22.64
Me and our Richard's coaching him aggressively, not landing at all, falling on deaf ears

1764
01:45:22.64 --> 01:45:24.20
as it were.

1765
01:45:24.20 --> 01:45:29.20
And every time it's like every maybe five, ten seconds, Richard would turn around and throw

1766
01:45:29.20 --> 01:45:32.48
his hands up as if to say, just guys, not listening to me.

1767
01:45:32.48 --> 01:45:33.96
And he did that maybe three, four times.

1768
01:45:33.96 --> 01:45:34.96
Right?

1769
01:45:34.96 --> 01:45:36.96
So you could tell it was not going good over there.

1770
01:45:36.96 --> 01:45:37.96
So I'm like, all right.

1771
01:45:37.96 --> 01:45:41.44
So we're all watching it mean by the brother and we're kind of laughing a little bit.

1772
01:45:41.44 --> 01:45:42.68
Because we see the scenario.

1773
01:45:42.68 --> 01:45:45.36
We see J getting stuck or in stuck or in Richard.

1774
01:45:45.36 --> 01:45:47.52
And we just see the whole thing playing out.

1775
01:45:47.52 --> 01:45:50.68
So later on, we kind of talked to J kind of teasing him.

1776
01:45:50.68 --> 01:45:51.68
Right?

1777
01:45:51.68 --> 01:45:52.68
Like, probably I wouldn't.

1778
01:45:52.68 --> 01:45:54.96
He just just like listen, whatever.

1779
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:59.16
And he went into that side of the whole deal where it's like, man, he can't.

1780
01:45:59.16 --> 01:46:05.28
Like, it's hard to listen when someone just like jumps in your whole stressful situation,

1781
01:46:05.28 --> 01:46:08.56
offering you all this like whack advice in this whack kind of way.

1782
01:46:08.56 --> 01:46:12.92
Yeah, there's ways to deliver advice in critical situations like that.

1783
01:46:12.92 --> 01:46:17.76
And even then most likely an indirect approach is advised.

1784
01:46:17.76 --> 01:46:22.000
And that's if the, okay, in this situation to hand or it doesn't matter what it looked like

1785
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:23.000
to us.

1786
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.88
It looked what it looked like to Richard is like, all this car obviously needs my advice

1787
01:46:26.88 --> 01:46:27.88
right now.

1788
01:46:27.88 --> 01:46:28.88
Obviously.

1789
01:46:28.88 --> 01:46:29.88
And he did his mind.

1790
01:46:29.88 --> 01:46:31.88
He's like, I've done this before.

1791
01:46:31.88 --> 01:46:37.40
So, so I had a conversation with somebody on EF online the other day.

1792
01:46:37.40 --> 01:46:43.12
I was saying, look, in this situation, you, you should approach with an indirect approach.

1793
01:46:43.12 --> 01:46:44.28
Yeah.

1794
01:46:44.28 --> 01:46:51.08
And then as I'm talking to her, I can see that she's not.

1795
01:46:51.08 --> 01:46:52.08
She's kind of annoyed.

1796
01:46:52.08 --> 01:46:56.92
And she actually was like, like a logic and facts based thing, look, why can't I just say

1797
01:46:56.92 --> 01:46:57.92
the logic and facts?

1798
01:46:57.92 --> 01:47:00.48
So what's going on and then have everyone just get on board with the program?

1799
01:47:00.48 --> 01:47:05.28
What's the kind of, what was the thought process, right?

1800
01:47:05.28 --> 01:47:11.08
And I said, you know, I can see that this bothers you because what you're saying from

1801
01:47:11.08 --> 01:47:16.64
your perspective is look, I know the facts.

1802
01:47:16.64 --> 01:47:21.08
It doesn't make any sense that I waste all this time trying to, you know, take this

1803
01:47:21.08 --> 01:47:24.96
indirect approach to try and get someone to understand the facts so we can change the direction

1804
01:47:24.96 --> 01:47:27.60
that we're going or adjust the plan.

1805
01:47:27.60 --> 01:47:29.16
Accordingly, that's just dumb.

1806
01:47:29.16 --> 01:47:31.52
I said, I can see that on your face.

1807
01:47:31.52 --> 01:47:34.80
Here's the thing.

1808
01:47:34.80 --> 01:47:39.36
If you take a direct, which is why we're having this conversation, by the way, you take

1809
01:47:39.36 --> 01:47:41.12
a direct approach and it doesn't work.

1810
01:47:41.12 --> 01:47:43.44
So you don't adjust the plan.

1811
01:47:43.44 --> 01:47:47.92
I'm suggesting you take an indirect approach, which will actually work.

1812
01:47:47.92 --> 01:47:52.80
And yes, it will take a little more time upfront, but the result will be positive.

1813
01:47:52.80 --> 01:47:59.28
So if Richard would have taken an indirect approach and walked over and it would be,

1814
01:47:59.28 --> 01:48:03.48
why should I have to tell J that and why should I have to say, I could just tell him, hey,

1815
01:48:03.48 --> 01:48:06.72
you need to put it reverse rock it or whatever advice he had to give him.

1816
01:48:06.72 --> 01:48:14.40
If you had gone over and said, you know, hey, do you want me to tell you where your tires

1817
01:48:14.40 --> 01:48:15.40
are at or something like that?

1818
01:48:15.40 --> 01:48:16.40
Right.

1819
01:48:16.40 --> 01:48:18.12
Just a little indirect approach.

1820
01:48:18.12 --> 01:48:19.76
Jump on his team.

1821
01:48:19.76 --> 01:48:21.76
Yeah, just jump on his team.

1822
01:48:21.76 --> 01:48:23.56
And then all of a sudden, J's mind is open.

1823
01:48:23.56 --> 01:48:27.04
I'll just send that literally on the same team, just by saying, hey, you want to put some

1824
01:48:27.04 --> 01:48:28.36
weight on the front for you?

1825
01:48:28.36 --> 01:48:29.36
No, whatever.

1826
01:48:29.36 --> 01:48:33.80
Hey, you know, do you want me to throw some extra?

1827
01:48:33.80 --> 01:48:34.80
Whatever.

1828
01:48:34.80 --> 01:48:35.92
Whatever you do to get on the team.

1829
01:48:35.92 --> 01:48:40.92
And then you're going to win in the end and the indirect approach, which seems like a big

1830
01:48:40.92 --> 01:48:42.28
pain in the ass out of the gate.

1831
01:48:42.28 --> 01:48:43.28
Oh, I got to keep leaving.

1832
01:48:43.28 --> 01:48:45.64
I have to do this and play this game.

1833
01:48:45.64 --> 01:48:48.36
I have to play this game.

1834
01:48:48.36 --> 01:48:51.80
Like, yeah, listen to what I'm talking to you about.

1835
01:48:51.80 --> 01:48:57.64
Play the game because you will actually get accomplished what you want to have get accomplished.

1836
01:48:57.64 --> 01:49:02.08
As opposed to, you know, I'm just going to, I'm just going to take a direct approach.

1837
01:49:02.08 --> 01:49:03.08
Yeah.

1838
01:49:03.08 --> 01:49:04.08
To tell them what's up.

1839
01:49:04.08 --> 01:49:05.76
People aren't ready to receive it.

1840
01:49:05.76 --> 01:49:06.76
And so it's useless.

1841
01:49:06.76 --> 01:49:09.28
Oh, it's so true.

1842
01:49:09.28 --> 01:49:10.28
Like you.

1843
01:49:10.28 --> 01:49:13.88
And I'm thinking back to the tired, getting stuck in the sense in aerial too.

1844
01:49:13.88 --> 01:49:14.88
Where?

1845
01:49:14.88 --> 01:49:15.88
And here's the thing to do it.

1846
01:49:15.88 --> 01:49:21.40
To make it matters worse, like it's reasonable to assume that how Richard came up to

1847
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:24.72
him wasn't like, hey, like we got a problem.

1848
01:49:24.72 --> 01:49:25.72
Let's do this.

1849
01:49:25.72 --> 01:49:26.72
It wasn't that.

1850
01:49:26.72 --> 01:49:28.36
It was like a dummy stuck in the sand dummy.

1851
01:49:28.36 --> 01:49:29.60
Like, you know what you're doing.

1852
01:49:29.60 --> 01:49:30.60
Kind of kind of the, I don't know.

1853
01:49:30.60 --> 01:49:35.000
I'm not sure what he said, but it seemed like that was the approach.

1854
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Right.

1855
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.72
Not only the direct approach, it was just openly hostile.

1856
01:49:38.72 --> 01:49:39.72
It was openly hostile.

1857
01:49:39.72 --> 01:49:40.72
It was openly hostile.

1858
01:49:40.72 --> 01:49:42.44
So now you get immediate defensiveness.

1859
01:49:42.44 --> 01:49:43.44
I'm not listening to anything.

1860
01:49:43.44 --> 01:49:45.12
You say, I would rather get stuck.

1861
01:49:45.12 --> 01:49:46.12
Yep, then listen to you.

1862
01:49:46.12 --> 01:49:48.24
That was literally like what I felt.

1863
01:49:48.24 --> 01:49:52.80
Like it seems like J.D. right now with way rather gets stuck and then listen to

1864
01:49:52.80 --> 01:49:53.80
Richard right now.

1865
01:49:53.80 --> 01:49:55.28
And quite frankly, I don't blame him.

1866
01:49:55.28 --> 01:49:58.92
The way Richard was throwing up his hands like, oh my gosh, you're so dumb.

1867
01:49:58.92 --> 01:50:00.32
Kind of a kind of a thing.

1868
01:50:00.32 --> 01:50:03.40
Like again, I didn't hear what he said, but that's what that's what his body language

1869
01:50:03.40 --> 01:50:04.40
was saying.

1870
01:50:04.40 --> 01:50:05.40
I'll tell you that.

1871
01:50:05.40 --> 01:50:08.64
So man, I kind of, I felt them and felt them.

1872
01:50:08.64 --> 01:50:09.64
So yeah, man.

1873
01:50:09.64 --> 01:50:14.76
Let's hope that this guy here can actually listen to what we're saying.

1874
01:50:14.76 --> 01:50:16.96
I mean it in the most positive possible way.

1875
01:50:16.96 --> 01:50:20.88
I think you can get out of this situation, but you got to take ownership of what's

1876
01:50:20.88 --> 01:50:21.88
going on.

1877
01:50:21.88 --> 01:50:26.68
And you got to make some real changes.

1878
01:50:26.68 --> 01:50:27.68
Hit us back up.

1879
01:50:27.68 --> 01:50:28.68
Hit me back up on that.

1880
01:50:28.68 --> 01:50:29.68
That'd be cool.

1881
01:50:29.68 --> 01:50:31.40
I'd like to hear how it all works out.

1882
01:50:31.40 --> 01:50:33.40
There's one where you're a positive feedback.

1883
01:50:33.40 --> 01:50:37.48
I think Jordan Peterson, I think it was on Joe Rogan, but so on, you know how they

1884
01:50:37.48 --> 01:50:40.32
make those like, Jordan, peace and version.

1885
01:50:40.32 --> 01:50:41.32
First Jordan.

1886
01:50:41.32 --> 01:50:42.32
Yeah.

1887
01:50:42.32 --> 01:50:46.68
And what he said got was part of, you got made into that, right?

1888
01:50:46.68 --> 01:50:47.68
Part of it.

1889
01:50:47.68 --> 01:50:52.84
So he was like, um, he was like, everybody's rejecting you.

1890
01:50:52.84 --> 01:50:54.24
Everybody's rejecting you.

1891
01:50:54.24 --> 01:50:55.24
Yeah.

1892
01:50:55.24 --> 01:50:56.24
It's you.

1893
01:50:56.24 --> 01:51:01.68
It's funny because it's like the tone that he said it, but that's kind of irrefutable logic.

1894
01:51:01.68 --> 01:51:02.68
Right there.

1895
01:51:02.68 --> 01:51:05.60
You know, where it's like, man, you're kind of like the girl.

1896
01:51:05.60 --> 01:51:06.60
It's a joke, I think.

1897
01:51:06.60 --> 01:51:07.60
I'm pretty sure it's a joke.

1898
01:51:07.60 --> 01:51:12.28
The girl who goes to the doctor and says, hey, like, um, my, my feeling.

1899
01:51:12.28 --> 01:51:15.16
I'm not sure if you're a singer, her to whatever, you know, like, when I touch here, like,

1900
01:51:15.16 --> 01:51:19.36
my finger hurts or whatever, and then the doctor goes, okay, the solution is don't touch

1901
01:51:19.36 --> 01:51:24.76
there, you know, kind of thing for that's like, it's real obvious to people, you know, it's

1902
01:51:24.76 --> 01:51:27.16
the torture genius that Lave talks about an extreme ownership.

1903
01:51:27.16 --> 01:51:28.16
Oh, yeah.

1904
01:51:28.16 --> 01:51:29.16
Oh, yeah.

1905
01:51:29.16 --> 01:51:32.20
They look, I'm right and everyone else just doesn't see the brilliance of my, you

1906
01:51:32.20 --> 01:51:33.20
know what I'm doing.

1907
01:51:33.20 --> 01:51:35.04
No one sees how brilliant I am.

1908
01:51:35.04 --> 01:51:36.04
No one sees how brilliant I am.

1909
01:51:36.04 --> 01:51:37.04
Yeah, they're too dumb.

1910
01:51:37.04 --> 01:51:39.52
And yeah, it's just horrible for me.

1911
01:51:39.52 --> 01:51:42.76
And it's like, no, actually, maybe you're not right.

1912
01:51:42.76 --> 01:51:43.76
No, first.

1913
01:51:43.76 --> 01:51:46.56
So at the very least, something's not right.

1914
01:51:46.56 --> 01:51:47.56
Very low.

1915
01:51:47.56 --> 01:51:48.56
These are your approaches wrong.

1916
01:51:48.56 --> 01:51:49.56
Next question.

1917
01:51:49.56 --> 01:51:56.28
Is it necessary to explain the why of what you're doing as a leader if you're not

1918
01:51:56.28 --> 01:51:58.000
ever asked why?

1919
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.96
My varsity athletes never question anything as I assume they think that I'll, it'll be

1920
01:52:02.96 --> 01:52:07.52
disrespectful or because they simply think they need to follow my directions.

1921
01:52:07.52 --> 01:52:12.48
Yeah, they're absolutely no one.

1922
01:52:12.48 --> 01:52:18.16
And people on your team do not need to ask you why for you to tell them.

1923
01:52:18.16 --> 01:52:21.76
You should tell them why they're doing what they're doing, that way they can lead, that

1924
01:52:21.76 --> 01:52:25.40
way they have a deeper understanding of what they're doing, that way they know how to act

1925
01:52:25.40 --> 01:52:31.68
and what to do when you're not there, which you won't always be there.

1926
01:52:31.68 --> 01:52:36.56
And when you do that, they actually learn.

1927
01:52:36.56 --> 01:52:40.20
They're actually learning how to lead themselves because they start to understand the importance

1928
01:52:40.20 --> 01:52:41.40
of knowing why.

1929
01:52:41.40 --> 01:52:44.08
So this happens to me.

1930
01:52:44.08 --> 01:52:47.92
I mean, there's a lot of people that have worked from over the years that I didn't

1931
01:52:47.92 --> 01:52:49.52
need to tell them why to do anything.

1932
01:52:49.52 --> 01:52:51.80
But they were ready to rock and roll.

1933
01:52:51.80 --> 01:52:53.60
Like they did not care.

1934
01:52:53.60 --> 01:52:57.92
I mean, you think JP ever looked at me and said, hey, hey, you explain to me why you want

1935
01:52:57.92 --> 01:52:58.92
me to do that?

1936
01:52:58.92 --> 01:53:01.92
No, he's like JP machine gunnest attack.

1937
01:53:01.92 --> 01:53:06.16
He's attacking, like by the time I get out of my mouth, he's going.

1938
01:53:06.16 --> 01:53:07.16
So there was no reason.

1939
01:53:07.16 --> 01:53:11.16
He's never going to ask me why.

1940
01:53:11.16 --> 01:53:14.16
You know, at least not back then, you know, now that we work together all the time, if I'm

1941
01:53:14.16 --> 01:53:15.16
like, hey, I think we should do this.

1942
01:53:15.16 --> 01:53:16.60
He said, well, why do you want me to do that?

1943
01:53:16.60 --> 01:53:21.68
Because he's, you know, he's running FTXs and he knows what's going on more than I do.

1944
01:53:21.68 --> 01:53:26.60
So if I tell him to do something or I ask him to do something, he might say, well, why do

1945
01:53:26.60 --> 01:53:27.60
you want me to do that?

1946
01:53:27.60 --> 01:53:28.60
What's the effect you're looking for?

1947
01:53:28.60 --> 01:53:29.60
It's different now.

1948
01:53:29.60 --> 01:53:34.96
But my point is, much like a varsity athlete, you know, that respects their coach and likes

1949
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:36.84
their coach and wants to do a good job.

1950
01:53:36.84 --> 01:53:42.44
Well, when JP was 21 years old, he wasn't asking me why to do anything.

1951
01:53:42.44 --> 01:53:46.36
And you know, for that matter, that was true for a lot of people that have worked for me

1952
01:53:46.36 --> 01:53:47.36
over the years.

1953
01:53:47.36 --> 01:53:51.52
Like, they trust me and they don't, they don't need no why they're doing what they're doing.

1954
01:53:51.52 --> 01:53:52.52
They're going to do it.

1955
01:53:52.52 --> 01:53:53.96
They're going to do it to the best of their ability.

1956
01:53:53.96 --> 01:53:57.000
That doesn't mean that I don't tell them why.

1957
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:57.84
Because I absolutely should.

1958
01:53:57.84 --> 01:54:00.28
Because if you don't know why you're doing what you're doing, you can't read decentralized

1959
01:54:00.28 --> 01:54:02.64
command doesn't work, can't make decisions in the field.

1960
01:54:02.64 --> 01:54:08.88
So even with football athletes, it's cool that they're totally just on board.

1961
01:54:08.88 --> 01:54:12.64
But you should still tell them why because it's a good principle to follow in any leadership

1962
01:54:12.64 --> 01:54:13.64
situation.

1963
01:54:13.64 --> 01:54:18.84
Yeah, yeah, especially as a coach too, man, that'll like supercharge the learning process,

1964
01:54:18.84 --> 01:54:20.40
I think, or the training process.

1965
01:54:20.40 --> 01:54:23.96
Like, even like in Jiu-Jitsu, this is good examples, like like, hate the scape or shrimp

1966
01:54:23.96 --> 01:54:24.96
being right.

1967
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:27.72
You know, when you first start or whatever, if you're just doing it across the map, you're

1968
01:54:27.72 --> 01:54:31.04
getting taught how to do it and all this stuff and you're kind of like, I don't really

1969
01:54:31.04 --> 01:54:32.04
get why we're doing it.

1970
01:54:32.04 --> 01:54:33.04
Good point.

1971
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:34.04
Right now.

1972
01:54:34.04 --> 01:54:35.04
You're going to do it.

1973
01:54:35.04 --> 01:54:36.04
You just do it because everyone else is doing it.

1974
01:54:36.04 --> 01:54:37.04
What are you going to do?

1975
01:54:37.04 --> 01:54:38.04
A new martial arts class.

1976
01:54:38.04 --> 01:54:39.04
And you're going to start asking that.

1977
01:54:39.04 --> 01:54:41.88
That's actually an excellent example.

1978
01:54:41.88 --> 01:54:48.36
Is if you know why you're learning the hip escape, then you do it with better intent.

1979
01:54:48.36 --> 01:54:53.16
And no one could tell just by watching you do it whether what your intent was or not.

1980
01:54:53.16 --> 01:54:56.56
Even though they might get a little scent of your intent.

1981
01:54:56.56 --> 01:54:59.04
But it's one of those situations.

1982
01:54:59.04 --> 01:55:01.20
But if you know why you're doing it, you're going to do it better.

1983
01:55:01.20 --> 01:55:05.04
Just like if you're coaching football and you got guys running a certain thing, they're

1984
01:55:05.04 --> 01:55:06.04
not going to ask you why.

1985
01:55:06.04 --> 01:55:09.68
But if you tell them why they know why they're doing it, they're going to do it better.

1986
01:55:09.68 --> 01:55:10.68
Yeah.

1987
01:55:10.68 --> 01:55:11.68
So, truly the football thing.

1988
01:55:11.68 --> 01:55:17.28
Because in football, you do kind of some oddball things if you just see it on the surface.

1989
01:55:17.28 --> 01:55:19.28
You know, there's a thing called the grass drills.

1990
01:55:19.28 --> 01:55:20.28
Right.

1991
01:55:20.28 --> 01:55:23.08
Where you just basically you get your feet like you kind of run in place real fast.

1992
01:55:23.08 --> 01:55:25.60
Like kind of little bit wider stance.

1993
01:55:25.60 --> 01:55:27.56
And then you like basically you sprawl.

1994
01:55:27.56 --> 01:55:31.08
You know, yeah, and you hit the ground, you get back up real quick.

1995
01:55:31.08 --> 01:55:33.88
And then you do, there's all these drills you do.

1996
01:55:33.88 --> 01:55:34.88
Right.

1997
01:55:34.88 --> 01:55:35.88
They face the ball this way.

1998
01:55:35.88 --> 01:55:38.80
Then you turn and then you come back and you're chopping your feet the whole time.

1999
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:42.92
So on the surface, I remember when I was like little doing that, I remember thinking, oh yeah,

2000
01:55:42.92 --> 01:55:44.48
this is just like conditioning.

2001
01:55:44.48 --> 01:55:45.48
Really?

2002
01:55:45.48 --> 01:55:48.08
Like, convenient, about conditioning, getting back up would.

2003
01:55:48.08 --> 01:55:52.92
But after a while, you're like, nah, because if you get knocked down, which you will,

2004
01:55:52.92 --> 01:55:58.84
you can knock down like three times within like 15 seconds, you know, like the faster you

2005
01:55:58.84 --> 01:56:03.08
can get up and start running again, it's like, bro, that's a good skill to have, you know,

2006
01:56:03.08 --> 01:56:04.08
kind of thing.

2007
01:56:04.08 --> 01:56:07.20
So if you're drilling that every single day, every single day, not only do you get better

2008
01:56:07.20 --> 01:56:09.44
and quicker at that, it becomes way more instinctual.

2009
01:56:09.44 --> 01:56:12.16
So okay, then there's a lot more to it, obviously.

2010
01:56:12.16 --> 01:56:16.96
But man, if someone was explaining that to you every time you're doing it, like even just

2011
01:56:16.96 --> 01:56:20.84
yelling it out, just calling it out as it's happening, like, good, this is going to get

2012
01:56:20.84 --> 01:56:22.88
you guys up quick when you get knocked down on a plate.

2013
01:56:22.88 --> 01:56:24.60
You know, just yelling it out, who cares?

2014
01:56:24.60 --> 01:56:27.08
Whatever, you don't have to sit them down and say, this is why you're doing these guys.

2015
01:56:27.08 --> 01:56:30.08
You don't have to say that necessarily I'm saying in a football situation.

2016
01:56:30.08 --> 01:56:34.24
But if you're going through that training with that in your mind, like, oh, I know why I'm

2017
01:56:34.24 --> 01:56:38.28
doing this, but you're going to charge that thing and, you know, promsolve better while you're

2018
01:56:38.28 --> 01:56:39.28
trying to, yeah, man.

2019
01:56:39.28 --> 01:56:43.16
It's, yeah, okay, go to the deep on that one.

2020
01:56:43.16 --> 01:56:47.80
I used, when I was coaching a lot of MMA fighters, I would always be telling them why they're

2021
01:56:47.80 --> 01:56:48.80
doing a drill.

2022
01:56:48.80 --> 01:56:51.96
And maybe think of when you were saying, you know, even if they're just yelling at you,

2023
01:56:51.96 --> 01:56:54.20
you know, I'd be like, this is the end of the round.

2024
01:56:54.20 --> 01:56:55.20
This is where you're going to be.

2025
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:56.20
Right.

2026
01:56:56.20 --> 01:56:57.20
Yes.

2027
01:56:57.20 --> 01:56:58.16
If you're down here, this is where you're going to have to get back up.

2028
01:56:58.16 --> 01:56:59.20
This is where the fight gets won.

2029
01:56:59.20 --> 01:57:03.20
Like, you know, because, you know, some fighters, if they get taken down and they're a striker

2030
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:05.56
and they're going to get to good grapple, if they get taken down, they're going to have

2031
01:57:05.56 --> 01:57:06.96
to get back up to win the fight.

2032
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:07.96
Yeah.

2033
01:57:07.96 --> 01:57:11.40
And so when they know that, you can see it, compute in their brain.

2034
01:57:11.40 --> 01:57:13.88
Whereas if I'm just saying, you get back up.

2035
01:57:13.88 --> 01:57:14.88
Yeah.

2036
01:57:14.88 --> 01:57:15.88
No.

2037
01:57:15.88 --> 01:57:16.88
So tell people why.

2038
01:57:16.88 --> 01:57:19.52
We're like one more question.

2039
01:57:19.52 --> 01:57:22.36
Question.

2040
01:57:22.36 --> 01:57:26.32
I've listened to all of the podcasts before asking this question.

2041
01:57:26.32 --> 01:57:32.68
Can you please explain, how do you deal or have dealt with your insecurities?

2042
01:57:32.68 --> 01:57:34.32
Thank you very much for your help.

2043
01:57:34.32 --> 01:57:41.28
I guess broadly fundamentally what I'm going to do with my insecurities is I'm going

2044
01:57:41.28 --> 01:57:42.76
to confront them.

2045
01:57:42.76 --> 01:57:44.16
I'm going to put them out there.

2046
01:57:44.16 --> 01:57:45.16
I'm going to own them.

2047
01:57:45.16 --> 01:57:46.16
I'm going to own them.

2048
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:49.16
I'm going to own my insecurities.

2049
01:57:49.16 --> 01:57:56.40
If I had to think of examples of situations where insecurities came into play for me,

2050
01:57:56.40 --> 01:58:05.68
one, I was going through Buds Basic Seal Training and there was an event called Pool Competency

2051
01:58:05.68 --> 01:58:11.32
where you are wearing your underwater breathing apparatus, your scuba gear and they do all

2052
01:58:11.32 --> 01:58:19.000
these horrible things to you and it's a very hard evolution and I failed it.

2053
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.12
I was confident going into it because I've done well.

2054
01:58:22.12 --> 01:58:25.88
Most of the water things underwater, not tying, life savings, et cetera, et cetera.

2055
01:58:25.88 --> 01:58:26.88
I had done well.

2056
01:58:26.88 --> 01:58:29.56
It was comfortable in the water.

2057
01:58:29.56 --> 01:58:40.000
When I failed this thing, which was, I was freaked out because people would fail,

2058
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:43.44
pool comp and get kicked out of Buds.

2059
01:58:43.44 --> 01:58:45.68
It's a nightmare for me.

2060
01:58:45.68 --> 01:58:46.68
I fail.

2061
01:58:46.68 --> 01:58:52.32
By the way, if you fail, so you take it on Friday and then if you fail, you take it

2062
01:58:52.32 --> 01:58:53.48
again on Monday.

2063
01:58:53.48 --> 01:58:59.000
If you fail, again, you're rolled back and then once you're rolled back, now you fail

2064
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:00.40
something else and you're gone.

2065
01:59:00.40 --> 01:59:01.88
It's a nightmare for me.

2066
01:59:01.88 --> 01:59:09.000
I'm completely, I've gone from confidence to insecurity about this thing.

2067
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:10.000
What did I do?

2068
01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.80
I've met in a couple of the other guys.

2069
01:59:12.80 --> 01:59:15.000
I don't know why the instructors let us do this.

2070
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.20
They could probably get in trouble for it, but they let us take the scuba gear and use

2071
01:59:19.20 --> 01:59:26.000
it in the dip tank, which is just a big bucket full of, I mean, a big container full of water,

2072
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.64
probably four feet deep and it's probably eight feet long by four feet wide.

2073
01:59:31.64 --> 01:59:35.72
So it's just a small, where you take fresh water and you put things to clean it.

2074
01:59:35.72 --> 01:59:38.12
You put in fresh, we call it a dip tank.

2075
01:59:38.12 --> 01:59:43.000
So they let us fill the dip tank up with one, totally unsupervised and we went in there,

2076
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.48
we pool comp each other.

2077
01:59:44.48 --> 01:59:50.52
So we ripped each other's mask off, beat each other to hell and just trashed ourselves.

2078
01:59:50.52 --> 01:59:56.32
And by the time I went on Monday, I was that insecurity that I had was now gone because

2079
01:59:56.32 --> 02:00:01.64
we had been so freaking harsh to each other that by the time I was rolling and I was like,

2080
02:00:01.64 --> 02:00:05.000
yeah, this is an even insecure that I'm like, bring it, go bring what you got.

2081
02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:06.56
I'm ready.

2082
02:00:06.56 --> 02:00:11.24
So that's a, that's one way to overcome.

2083
02:00:11.24 --> 02:00:14.76
That I look at is something I was insecure nervous about, right?

2084
02:00:14.76 --> 02:00:16.000
How am I going to overcome it?

2085
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I'm going to attack it.

2086
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.20
I'm going to go straight into that thing, into that insecurity.

2087
02:00:22.20 --> 02:00:29.44
Another thing I was thinking about was kind of funny was I was like at a bar, you know,

2088
02:00:29.44 --> 02:00:36.000
burping into, when I was young and single and whatever, hanging out, you know, having

2089
02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:42.72
some beverages and I'm choked with chatting with some girl that I met and you know, as

2090
02:00:42.72 --> 02:00:46.96
we're talking, we're just kind of just talking, having a good time, whatever.

2091
02:00:46.96 --> 02:00:50.40
And she's like, oh, you know, what are you, you know, what are you, you know, what are

2092
02:00:50.40 --> 02:00:51.92
you, I'm a dental hygienist.

2093
02:00:51.92 --> 02:00:55.60
She's a dental hygienist and all that's cool.

2094
02:00:55.60 --> 02:01:05.16
And then she says like something like, you know, we could take care of that gap in

2095
02:01:05.16 --> 02:01:06.16
your teeth.

2096
02:01:06.16 --> 02:01:14.40
She says that through and like without missing a beat, I'm like, are you serious?

2097
02:01:14.40 --> 02:01:16.08
I didn't know that you could expand gaps.

2098
02:01:16.08 --> 02:01:19.84
How much bigger could you make it?

2099
02:01:19.84 --> 02:01:25.96
And you know, like she was, she was like totally, I don't know if the word stoked, but

2100
02:01:25.96 --> 02:01:31.64
she realized that this, whatever, you know, this gap between my teeth, which some people

2101
02:01:31.64 --> 02:01:35.68
might have is a big insecurity, like, oh, you know, cover your mouth.

2102
02:01:35.68 --> 02:01:37.72
Um, those are, it's fine.

2103
02:01:37.72 --> 02:01:38.72
Like there it is.

2104
02:01:38.72 --> 02:01:40.52
I'm making fun of it basically.

2105
02:01:40.52 --> 02:01:41.52
Make it.

2106
02:01:41.52 --> 02:01:47.40
So that's, I think that is the bottom line when you have some kind of in something that

2107
02:01:47.40 --> 02:01:49.04
you're insecure about.

2108
02:01:49.04 --> 02:01:53.12
Well, if it's something that you can take control of or cool, then attack it and get good

2109
02:01:53.12 --> 02:01:54.12
at it.

2110
02:01:54.12 --> 02:01:57.16
You know, if you're insecure about talking in front of people, cool, attack that problem

2111
02:01:57.16 --> 02:01:58.52
and get better at it.

2112
02:01:58.52 --> 02:02:02.60
If you're insecure about, you know, confrontations with people start training to get to.

2113
02:02:02.60 --> 02:02:07.12
If you're insecure, whatever, whatever you're insecure about, do it more.

2114
02:02:07.12 --> 02:02:10.16
If you're insecure, if you think I have your time I read an email, I feel like, you know,

2115
02:02:10.16 --> 02:02:12.80
it looks like junk, cool, right, more get better at writing.

2116
02:02:12.80 --> 02:02:15.36
So there's insecurities that you have like that you can attack.

2117
02:02:15.36 --> 02:02:21.32
If there's something that you can't change or that you can't control, then just get

2118
02:02:21.32 --> 02:02:23.84
it out there and have fun with it.

2119
02:02:23.84 --> 02:02:31.64
As far as I'm concerned, you know, make, does that make sense?

2120
02:02:31.64 --> 02:02:32.64
Is that a bad answer?

2121
02:02:32.64 --> 02:02:34.12
No, not to get into.

2122
02:02:34.12 --> 02:02:39.12
In fact, that's a very clever response to the dental hygienist.

2123
02:02:39.12 --> 02:02:43.80
The dental hygienist wanting to fix the gap in my teeth.

2124
02:02:43.80 --> 02:02:52.68
So that I think that's good for questions, you know, and hey, it's an interesting time

2125
02:02:52.68 --> 02:02:54.76
since right now, what is it?

2126
02:02:54.76 --> 02:02:56.76
It's April 2020.

2127
02:02:56.76 --> 02:03:03.82
A lot of mayhem going on in the world, everything from, well, we got viruses, you know, and

2128
02:03:03.82 --> 02:03:08.20
it's the tornadoes and just all kinds of things.

2129
02:03:08.20 --> 02:03:16.12
And, you know, as I look at what's going on, it's just a gentle reminder to everybody

2130
02:03:16.12 --> 02:03:22.64
and maybe not so gentle reminder that the world is a hard place.

2131
02:03:22.64 --> 02:03:27.44
The world as a hard place in the world has no mercy.

2132
02:03:27.44 --> 02:03:30.72
The world does not care.

2133
02:03:30.72 --> 02:03:38.16
Nature does not care, disease and disaster and viruses and violence.

2134
02:03:38.16 --> 02:03:43.52
And this is the thing that you need to remember is that even time itself, even just

2135
02:03:43.52 --> 02:03:49.92
time itself is picking you apart.

2136
02:03:49.92 --> 02:03:57.16
So we every minute of every day, time is taking you down.

2137
02:03:57.16 --> 02:04:03.84
And if you stare at that stuff, long enough, if you stare at those things, long enough,

2138
02:04:03.84 --> 02:04:13.28
then just like the sun, it, it'll blind you.

2139
02:04:13.28 --> 02:04:17.12
And so I say, don't stare at it.

2140
02:04:17.12 --> 02:04:18.68
Don't stare at those things.

2141
02:04:18.68 --> 02:04:22.16
Don't let them possess your brain.

2142
02:04:22.16 --> 02:04:29.60
Don't let them take over your mind because just like the sun can blind you, the sun also,

2143
02:04:29.60 --> 02:04:33.20
the sun also gives us light.

2144
02:04:33.20 --> 02:04:34.60
And it gives us warmth.

2145
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:35.80
And it gives us life.

2146
02:04:35.80 --> 02:04:44.12
And those dreadful things in the world, they may win in the end.

2147
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:52.28
And I can actually guarantee that time will.

2148
02:04:52.28 --> 02:05:00.68
Time will win in the end, but it's not going to win right now.

2149
02:05:00.68 --> 02:05:08.20
So in the meantime, make sure you live.

2150
02:05:08.20 --> 02:05:09.48
Make sure you give it everything you got.

2151
02:05:09.48 --> 02:05:14.08
Make sure you leave it on the field.

2152
02:05:14.08 --> 02:05:24.16
And live your life not blinded by the sun, but fueled by it.

2153
02:05:24.16 --> 02:05:31.52
I don't know if that's all I've got for tonight.

2154
02:05:31.52 --> 02:05:41.72
The record Charles, speaking of fuel, I know we need some clean fuel for our undertakings.

2155
02:05:41.72 --> 02:05:45.84
What is it?

2156
02:05:45.84 --> 02:05:48.84
Clean fuel, no excuses.

2157
02:05:48.84 --> 02:05:52.64
All right, well, what is it, juggle?

2158
02:05:52.64 --> 02:05:54.88
Clean fuel, no excuses.

2159
02:05:54.88 --> 02:05:56.88
That's a good one.

2160
02:05:56.88 --> 02:05:58.28
Are you missing one apparently?

2161
02:05:58.28 --> 02:06:02.48
All right, well, we're going to revisit that last one another time, but in the meantime,

2162
02:06:02.48 --> 02:06:06.36
what we can do is you're probably forgetting the most important one.

2163
02:06:06.36 --> 02:06:07.36
Maybe it's hard work.

2164
02:06:07.36 --> 02:06:09.36
All right, hard work.

2165
02:06:09.36 --> 02:06:12.36
That's not enough.

2166
02:06:12.36 --> 02:06:13.36
That's not enough.

2167
02:06:13.36 --> 02:06:16.36
That's why we were reaching.

2168
02:06:16.36 --> 02:06:18.96
Last, yes, hard work.

2169
02:06:18.96 --> 02:06:20.36
Clean fuel, no excuses.

2170
02:06:20.36 --> 02:06:21.76
There you go.

2171
02:06:21.76 --> 02:06:23.76
Origin, USA.

2172
02:06:23.76 --> 02:06:28.36
By the way, but before we begin to clean fuel, we're going to do hard work.

2173
02:06:28.36 --> 02:06:34.04
But it's better in my opinion to do hard work, doing something that you enjoy.

2174
02:06:34.04 --> 02:06:35.44
And that's going to benefit you.

2175
02:06:35.44 --> 02:06:38.04
By the way, explain why you're doing what you're doing.

2176
02:06:38.04 --> 02:06:45.04
That gives you physical training, physical strength, physical stamina, and confidence.

2177
02:06:45.04 --> 02:06:46.04
Yes, sir.

2178
02:06:46.04 --> 02:06:48.84
We're hoping that the home's going to start to train if you just get that confidence up.

2179
02:06:48.84 --> 02:06:50.84
Capability across the board.

2180
02:06:50.84 --> 02:06:54.04
Be more capable and increase it your confidence.

2181
02:06:54.04 --> 02:06:55.64
Yes, sir, big time.

2182
02:06:55.64 --> 02:06:57.04
So we're training, jiu-jitsu.

2183
02:06:57.04 --> 02:07:00.04
We're working out, working out, and training jiu-jitsu.

2184
02:07:00.04 --> 02:07:04.64
Well, at this very moment, jiu-jitsu is kept to, for two minimum.

2185
02:07:04.64 --> 02:07:09.64
We'll say a minimum, really, which is the safe and right thing to do, by the way.

2186
02:07:09.64 --> 02:07:12.64
You'd think that sounds debatable.

2187
02:07:12.64 --> 02:07:13.64
Right now.

2188
02:07:13.64 --> 02:07:15.64
You know, we did that podcast with Andy.

2189
02:07:15.64 --> 02:07:18.64
We did a grounded podcast with Andy.

2190
02:07:18.64 --> 02:07:24.64
And I forget when we recorded it, but like we were talking about jiu-jitsu and whatever

2191
02:07:24.64 --> 02:07:28.64
people are like, you know, training is morally irresponsible and stuff.

2192
02:07:28.64 --> 02:07:29.64
Like, were you guys trained?

2193
02:07:29.64 --> 02:07:31.64
Well, for what we didn't.

2194
02:07:31.64 --> 02:07:37.64
But I don't even remember what phase of, you know, all that was going on.

2195
02:07:37.64 --> 02:07:41.64
But yeah, so the bottom line is you are correct right now.

2196
02:07:41.64 --> 02:07:43.64
Jiu-jitsu training is kind of at a fatal moment.

2197
02:07:43.64 --> 02:07:44.64
Yeah, big for everybody.

2198
02:07:44.64 --> 02:07:51.64
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get too into like, what, you know, where, where we stand on like the whole thing or whatever,

2199
02:07:51.64 --> 02:07:55.64
but there's like a big picture, small picture scenario going on.

2200
02:07:55.64 --> 02:07:59.64
And a short term in long term scenario kind of playing out.

2201
02:07:59.64 --> 02:08:01.64
Like it always does.

2202
02:08:01.64 --> 02:08:07.64
And like, I think like if you're doing, okay, so what I use is this term,

2203
02:08:07.64 --> 02:08:11.64
like falling on the right side of the fence of history or something like that.

2204
02:08:11.64 --> 02:08:16.64
Where, okay, we're trying with this thing, we're just ready for it to be done.

2205
02:08:16.64 --> 02:08:17.64
This whole deal.

2206
02:08:17.64 --> 02:08:20.64
If quarantine, all this stuff, we're ready for it to be done.

2207
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:25.64
So there's certain things you can do and not do to kind of help facilitate the passing of this thing.

2208
02:08:25.64 --> 02:08:29.64
And then there's things that kind of don't help the facility, this health facility,

2209
02:08:29.64 --> 02:08:30.64
the facility, the passing of these things.

2210
02:08:30.64 --> 02:08:37.64
And those things you can do that halt the passing of this thing.

2211
02:08:37.64 --> 02:08:39.64
That jam will solve up.

2212
02:08:39.64 --> 02:08:40.64
All right.

2213
02:08:40.64 --> 02:08:40.64
Okay.

2214
02:08:40.64 --> 02:08:42.64
So the question is what are we doing?

2215
02:08:42.64 --> 02:08:43.64
So try to do it.

2216
02:08:43.64 --> 02:08:44.64
So what are you doing?

2217
02:08:44.64 --> 02:08:45.64
Exactly.

2218
02:08:45.64 --> 02:08:49.64
It's so far every time everybody, but you know, the things that are like the short term long term,

2219
02:08:49.64 --> 02:08:52.64
short term you're going to have to, you're going to have to take a hit short term.

2220
02:08:52.64 --> 02:08:56.64
You know what I mean, small picture, you just do an abunch of other stuff.

2221
02:08:56.64 --> 02:08:57.64
I think about it.

2222
02:08:57.64 --> 02:09:00.64
You're getting better even when I'm not training because I'm studying.

2223
02:09:00.64 --> 02:09:01.64
Yeah, that's see.

2224
02:09:01.64 --> 02:09:02.64
And there you go.

2225
02:09:02.64 --> 02:09:03.64
Mental reps.

2226
02:09:03.64 --> 02:09:05.64
Medicines, some stuff.

2227
02:09:05.64 --> 02:09:10.64
But you know, the thing is it's a two-sided situation that has to be like,

2228
02:09:10.64 --> 02:09:11.64
they're battling with each other.

2229
02:09:11.64 --> 02:09:13.64
And it's kind of, it's kind of whack.

2230
02:09:13.64 --> 02:09:14.64
So dichotomy.

2231
02:09:14.64 --> 02:09:15.64
So dichotomy.

2232
02:09:15.64 --> 02:09:18.64
And the last one we get back to, you just do if we weren't already in

2233
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:22.64
jujitsu and we're going to start jujitsu when we can.

2234
02:09:22.64 --> 02:09:23.64
We're going to get a geek.

2235
02:09:23.64 --> 02:09:24.64
We're going to get a rash card.

2236
02:09:24.64 --> 02:09:26.64
That's just the sort of the uniform.

2237
02:09:26.64 --> 02:09:28.64
Really, best in the world, origin.

2238
02:09:28.64 --> 02:09:29.64
Yeah.

2239
02:09:29.64 --> 02:09:31.64
Well, it's just sort of a nose.

2240
02:09:31.64 --> 02:09:34.64
Hey, look, we make jujitsu geys.

2241
02:09:34.64 --> 02:09:35.64
We make jeans.

2242
02:09:35.64 --> 02:09:37.64
We make boots right at this moment in time.

2243
02:09:37.64 --> 02:09:39.64
April, 2020.

2244
02:09:39.64 --> 02:09:44.64
We actually have shifted to making face coverings.

2245
02:09:44.64 --> 02:09:51.64
Is the term, right? Because the president and the CDC and the government has said to

2246
02:09:51.64 --> 02:09:52.64
where face coverings.

2247
02:09:52.64 --> 02:09:54.64
So we started making face coverings.

2248
02:09:54.64 --> 02:09:58.64
We actually shut down our other lines to make face coverings for people.

2249
02:09:58.64 --> 02:10:03.64
So that's what's going on right now at originmain.com.

2250
02:10:03.64 --> 02:10:09.64
We will get back to manufacturing jeans, boots, t-shirts at the whole nine yards.

2251
02:10:09.64 --> 02:10:11.64
There's still some stuff in stock.

2252
02:10:11.64 --> 02:10:16.64
As far as geys and stuff go, but right now that's what we're focused on is trying to get help

2253
02:10:16.64 --> 02:10:21.64
America get through this scenario that we're in right now.

2254
02:10:21.64 --> 02:10:24.64
And so you can you can check out those masks if you want.

2255
02:10:24.64 --> 02:10:26.64
We won't be making them for a long.

2256
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:28.64
Just because other people are starting to catch up.

2257
02:10:28.64 --> 02:10:33.64
And so we were able to pivot very quickly because we have the entire supply chain right there.

2258
02:10:33.64 --> 02:10:34.64
We own everything.

2259
02:10:34.64 --> 02:10:35.64
We make everything.

2260
02:10:35.64 --> 02:10:38.64
There's no, like, do we have everything in house?

2261
02:10:38.64 --> 02:10:44.64
So Pete and the team at origin was able to really quickly start making these face coverings.

2262
02:10:44.64 --> 02:10:52.64
And so as other companies start to make, make them, we'll go back to making what we want to make.

2263
02:10:52.64 --> 02:10:56.64
You know, no one wants to be in the business of making masks, right?

2264
02:10:56.64 --> 02:10:57.64
But that's what the country needs.

2265
02:10:57.64 --> 02:10:59.64
So that's what we're doing right now.

2266
02:10:59.64 --> 02:11:03.64
If you want to get one of those, yeah, you can get them at originmain.com.

2267
02:11:03.64 --> 02:11:06.64
We're trying to make them as fast as we can.

2268
02:11:06.64 --> 02:11:11.64
And so that's one way to help America get through this.

2269
02:11:11.64 --> 02:11:15.64
They're not N95 masks, right?

2270
02:11:15.64 --> 02:11:21.64
They're what we can make, which is face coverings, which is what is in demand.

2271
02:11:21.64 --> 02:11:25.64
You know, like I went to a meeting the other day on a construction site and you know what?

2272
02:11:25.64 --> 02:11:27.64
You have to wear a face covering.

2273
02:11:27.64 --> 02:11:28.64
So what am I wearing?

2274
02:11:28.64 --> 02:11:29.64
I'm wearing an origin face cover.

2275
02:11:29.64 --> 02:11:30.64
That's what it's made for.

2276
02:11:30.64 --> 02:11:32.64
It's not made for me to go and work in an ER.

2277
02:11:32.64 --> 02:11:35.64
No, it's made to show respect to someone else.

2278
02:11:35.64 --> 02:11:37.64
Hey, look, I don't want to call for you.

2279
02:11:37.64 --> 02:11:39.64
I don't want to if I have it, which no one knows if you haven't

2280
02:11:39.64 --> 02:11:41.64
or not, because a lot of people are asymptomatic.

2281
02:11:41.64 --> 02:11:44.64
So you wear this thing to protect the people around you.

2282
02:11:44.64 --> 02:11:49.64
You know, strangers, normal people, and what you're doing there is you're going back to what you were saying earlier.

2283
02:11:49.64 --> 02:11:53.64
You are doing your best to halt the disease.

2284
02:11:53.64 --> 02:11:55.64
So we can get back to normalcy.

2285
02:11:55.64 --> 02:12:01.64
So if you want one of these masks or an originmain.com, and you can get one there.

2286
02:12:01.64 --> 02:12:05.64
Also, we have a bunch of supplements there.

2287
02:12:05.64 --> 02:12:11.64
So if you're, and I know this is, you know, we've seen a huge spike in like mole, right?

2288
02:12:11.64 --> 02:12:13.64
Because people don't want to go to the store.

2289
02:12:13.64 --> 02:12:15.64
There's starting to be a shortage of food.

2290
02:12:15.64 --> 02:12:20.64
If you get mole, you know, if you get mole, which is good tasting protein.

2291
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:28.64
And we're selling a ton of mole right now because people know that it's a good thing to have, you know, in your house.

2292
02:12:28.64 --> 02:12:32.64
Because you can feed your kids, you can feed you. You can, I don't know.

2293
02:12:32.64 --> 02:12:36.64
I don't know what to make the claim that you know, however you're long, you could survive on mole cold.

2294
02:12:36.64 --> 02:12:43.64
But it's a great, it's a great thing to have in your house as, as food suppliers are getting shut down.

2295
02:12:43.64 --> 02:12:45.64
Because of the virus or whatever.

2296
02:12:45.64 --> 02:12:52.64
So we've been selling a ton of mole, we've been selling a lot of, we sold out of Cold War, which is like an immune system booster.

2297
02:12:52.64 --> 02:12:54.64
We just got it back in stock.

2298
02:12:54.64 --> 02:12:58.64
And that's been selling like crazy because it's got, you know, it's got things that help boost your immune system.

2299
02:12:58.64 --> 02:13:06.64
Again, is this, is this a origin, or is this a COVID, destroyer? No, it's just going to help your immune system.

2300
02:13:06.64 --> 02:13:08.64
So people don't want to get sick right now.

2301
02:13:08.64 --> 02:13:11.64
So that's been selling a lot.

2302
02:13:11.64 --> 02:13:13.64
But that's what we're doing at a origin right now.

2303
02:13:13.64 --> 02:13:16.64
It's, you know, different, it's different times.

2304
02:13:16.64 --> 02:13:19.64
What else, what am I missing?

2305
02:13:19.64 --> 02:13:20.64
Yeah.

2306
02:13:20.64 --> 02:13:24.64
But I mean, the retina supplements, you know, the joint warfare.

2307
02:13:24.64 --> 02:13:25.64
That's one thing that's going on right now.

2308
02:13:25.64 --> 02:13:30.64
A lot of people are working out, you know, hard-coated, you need that joint warfare.

2309
02:13:30.64 --> 02:13:31.64
Um, krill oil.

2310
02:13:31.64 --> 02:13:33.64
So we got all that stuff still.

2311
02:13:33.64 --> 02:13:37.64
But, um, yeah, if you still, if you want to check that stuff out, you can check that out.

2312
02:13:37.64 --> 02:13:40.64
We're also, like, we're making some fitness equipment.

2313
02:13:40.64 --> 02:13:42.64
We, you know, like, pile boxes.

2314
02:13:42.64 --> 02:13:43.64
Yeah.

2315
02:13:43.64 --> 02:13:44.64
We just started making pile boxes.

2316
02:13:44.64 --> 02:13:45.64
Why?

2317
02:13:45.64 --> 02:13:48.64
Look, our goal is not to make pile boxes.

2318
02:13:48.64 --> 02:13:49.64
Here's the deal.

2319
02:13:49.64 --> 02:13:52.64
A America is sold out of pile boxes right now.

2320
02:13:52.64 --> 02:13:57.64
And so people want them because they're shifting to a home gym scenario.

2321
02:13:57.64 --> 02:13:58.64
Yeah.

2322
02:13:58.64 --> 02:14:01.64
So we just started manufacturing those.

2323
02:14:01.64 --> 02:14:03.64
So if you want to get a pile box, you can go and what,

2324
02:14:03.64 --> 02:14:07.64
look, we're doing what we can to help get through this situation.

2325
02:14:07.64 --> 02:14:12.64
We just made another thing, which you saw the burden.

2326
02:14:12.64 --> 02:14:13.64
The burden.

2327
02:14:13.64 --> 02:14:18.64
It's like a old, I know it's, it's, what was it?

2328
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:25.64
It's like a kettlebell slash Bulgarian bag slash medicine ball slash any other slashes.

2329
02:14:25.64 --> 02:14:28.64
Oh, old boxing glove.

2330
02:14:28.64 --> 02:14:29.64
I don't know old boxing glove.

2331
02:14:29.64 --> 02:14:30.64
Yes.

2332
02:14:30.64 --> 02:14:35.64
So we got thing called a burden, which you're going to be able to use for kettlebell exercises.

2333
02:14:35.64 --> 02:14:37.64
But it's made a leather.

2334
02:14:37.64 --> 02:14:38.64
It's bad.

2335
02:14:38.64 --> 02:14:39.64
Asloka.

2336
02:14:39.64 --> 02:14:40.64
We got it.

2337
02:14:40.64 --> 02:14:41.64
So yeah.

2338
02:14:41.64 --> 02:14:47.64
Well, what the, you can explain the history on now, or the, you know, I mean, the long history is I have an idea.

2339
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:51.64
Which I talked to P.O.A.L.A. ago, we brainstormed of making something called the burden,

2340
02:14:51.64 --> 02:14:52.64
which was something you could just carry.

2341
02:14:52.64 --> 02:14:55.64
We could just carry the burden with you all the time, right?

2342
02:14:55.64 --> 02:14:57.64
So no matter what's happening, you carry the burden.

2343
02:14:57.64 --> 02:14:58.64
You can put it in your backpack.

2344
02:14:58.64 --> 02:14:59.64
You can put it in your briefcase.

2345
02:14:59.64 --> 02:15:03.64
You can, and you're constantly carrying around, you know, 20, 30 pounds worth of extra weight,

2346
02:15:03.64 --> 02:15:05.64
which just makes you stronger.

2347
02:15:05.64 --> 02:15:11.64
So, but you know, it's, you know, you go through a development process and you look at, you know,

2348
02:15:11.64 --> 02:15:16.64
what, what, what resources do we want to put on doing this from the company?

2349
02:15:16.64 --> 02:15:22.64
And right now, again, a bunch of people are saying they have to work at home now, work out at home.

2350
02:15:22.64 --> 02:15:24.64
And they can't, because they don't have any equipment.

2351
02:15:24.64 --> 02:15:30.64
Well, how can we make good, you know, what can we make that would make it possible for people to work out at home better?

2352
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:39.64
This is one of those things, you know, everybody wants, I mean, you, the amount of that, the amount of different workouts you can do with a kettlebell is phenomenal.

2353
02:15:39.64 --> 02:15:44.64
So this, and kettlebells are, you know, sold out everywhere.

2354
02:15:44.64 --> 02:15:47.64
Everywhere. All gym equipment, this all that, every gym equipment, everywhere sold out.

2355
02:15:47.64 --> 02:15:53.64
It's crazy because my, you know, my wife's talking to her little groups and all this stuff and everyone's asking her,

2356
02:15:53.64 --> 02:15:55.64
like, hey, do you guys have any extra weight?

2357
02:15:55.64 --> 02:15:58.64
So I'm like, why the heck is it like, why is everyone asking this?

2358
02:15:58.64 --> 02:16:02.64
Why is this Jennifer for a gender garden class asking about kettlebells?

2359
02:16:02.64 --> 02:16:08.64
Yeah, because the gym shut down and they're like, hey, they know that we have a bunch of weights or whatever,

2360
02:16:08.64 --> 02:16:11.64
but it's, it was crazy how many people were asking us.

2361
02:16:11.64 --> 02:16:14.64
Like, hey, do you have any extra, my neighbor's like, hey, do you have any extra weights, you have any extra weights?

2362
02:16:14.64 --> 02:16:16.64
Unfortunately, I don't have any extra weights.

2363
02:16:16.64 --> 02:16:22.64
Like, I usually, like, every, I have two day workout, like, the workout programs, one day, one day, two, and they just repeat.

2364
02:16:22.64 --> 02:16:28.64
So I use all my weights, all of them. There's literally two weight weights that I don't use.

2365
02:16:28.64 --> 02:16:31.64
And yeah, sure enough, they just came grab them whatever.

2366
02:16:31.64 --> 02:16:36.64
So it's like, man, yes, so they need that, the burden stuff where you keep going.

2367
02:16:36.64 --> 02:16:40.64
Yeah, so that's the thing is, well, it'll ship with no weight in it.

2368
02:16:40.64 --> 02:16:50.64
Like, you'll fill it with shot with steel bearings or lead shot or whatever, you know, sand or rocks, depending on how heavy you want it.

2369
02:16:50.64 --> 02:16:55.64
But yeah, the bottom line is we're very lucky.

2370
02:16:55.64 --> 02:17:09.64
We're very lucky because, no, no, no, I'm just, I don't want to just call it luck, but to have the capability to own the supply chain and be able to make things that, that all of a sudden are in demand.

2371
02:17:09.64 --> 02:17:16.64
Like, there's not too many people that can pivot and go from manufacturing boots, because it's all in America.

2372
02:17:16.64 --> 02:17:23.64
It's all under one roof. Hey, we can make these and we can make them starting in a day or two days.

2373
02:17:23.64 --> 02:17:29.64
And that's exactly what we're doing. It's trying to give people what they need during this crisis.

2374
02:17:29.64 --> 02:17:32.64
And it's been great so far.

2375
02:17:32.64 --> 02:17:44.64
So if you guys want to check that stuff out, if you need a pile box at your house and or if you need a burden to carry, you can check that out, masks, whatever, there there as well.

2376
02:17:44.64 --> 02:17:55.64
And then all the, all the different, all the different supplements are there. So appreciate the support and if you want, if you guys have ideas or whatever, you see a demand for something.

2377
02:17:55.64 --> 02:17:58.64
Let us know because that's what we're doing.

2378
02:17:58.64 --> 02:18:05.64
We're trying to help. We look, obviously, we want to get back just like anyone else. Everyone else.

2379
02:18:05.64 --> 02:18:10.64
We want to get back to making jeans, boots and geese. That's what we want to make. And shorts and t-shirts and everything else.

2380
02:18:10.64 --> 02:18:22.64
But when there's a, when there's a need, we, we have to try and help, you know, get through this. So also, we have a store, jocco store dot com, it's online store.

2381
02:18:22.64 --> 02:18:28.64
We're, you know, on Amazon, they're, they're, they only ship, they only ship certain items quicker now.

2382
02:18:28.64 --> 02:18:31.64
Yeah, yeah, you buy stuff through Amazon. It can take like a month for weeks.

2383
02:18:31.64 --> 02:18:38.64
Yes, it's interesting about that is for origin supplements on Amazon.

2384
02:18:38.64 --> 02:18:42.64
Those are in the category of getting shipped like immediate.

2385
02:18:42.64 --> 02:18:49.64
Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, they looked at the products that we make and the health items and that just put us in the category.

2386
02:18:49.64 --> 02:18:56.64
So if you want to get more, if you want to get joint warfare, if you want to get cold war, you can get it from Amazon right now.

2387
02:18:56.64 --> 02:19:01.64
And it's on that list of stuff that's considered essential, which is, which is awesome.

2388
02:19:01.64 --> 02:19:04.64
Yeah, yes. And yeah, that is good.

2389
02:19:04.64 --> 02:19:12.64
Yeah, what I did was I, when I, you know, I was going through the list with Jeff and just pointed out some of the things that we had that I thought American needed.

2390
02:19:12.64 --> 02:19:14.64
Sure.

2391
02:19:14.64 --> 02:19:16.64
There you go.

2392
02:19:16.64 --> 02:19:19.64
Mm. Being these else, we go way back.

2393
02:19:19.64 --> 02:19:24.64
Yeah, yeah, good. Good relationship building has a really bad attempt at a joke.

2394
02:19:24.64 --> 02:19:30.64
Yeah, I respect it. And the last, the news is, Jockel Store is okay.

2395
02:19:30.64 --> 02:19:37.64
Is your get after it, just putting it through them shirt or hoodie? Like, is that an essential item?

2396
02:19:37.64 --> 02:19:40.64
Yeah, maybe it will just say it's debatable. I don't know.

2397
02:19:40.64 --> 02:19:45.64
It depends on who you are. I'm not going to make some crude kind of comparison, but you know, that look.

2398
02:19:45.64 --> 02:19:48.64
There's no answer for that. Maybe there is. Maybe there isn't. I don't know.

2399
02:19:48.64 --> 02:19:49.64
Back to the layman. No.

2400
02:19:49.64 --> 02:19:52.64
With my irrefutable logic or nothing like this.

2401
02:19:52.64 --> 02:19:55.64
But we are shipping normal.

2402
02:19:55.64 --> 02:19:58.64
You know, have to wait the four weeks normal shipping.

2403
02:19:58.64 --> 02:20:03.64
You know, maybe some here and there if there's like a big influx or whatever because of like, you know, the staffing and stuff.

2404
02:20:03.64 --> 02:20:06.64
But shipping is normal. So that's good news.

2405
02:20:06.64 --> 02:20:08.64
Anyway, Jockel Store at dot com. The street can get your disciplining suit.

2406
02:20:08.64 --> 02:20:09.64
I'm sure it's hoodies.

2407
02:20:09.64 --> 02:20:12.64
Rashcards, if you, hey, get a rash card now.

2408
02:20:12.64 --> 02:20:14.64
I think we have some still.

2409
02:20:14.64 --> 02:20:18.64
But people on the street just for now.

2410
02:20:18.64 --> 02:20:21.64
Just be careful with it. I careful with what we're doing.

2411
02:20:21.64 --> 02:20:25.64
Nonetheless, you're putting forth a positive message.

2412
02:20:25.64 --> 02:20:27.64
Yes. On both.

2413
02:20:27.64 --> 02:20:29.64
But do you wear a rash card when you just lift?

2414
02:20:29.64 --> 02:20:30.64
I don't.

2415
02:20:30.64 --> 02:20:30.64
No.

2416
02:20:30.64 --> 02:20:32.64
But I do for some work out.

2417
02:20:32.64 --> 02:20:32.64
Yeah.

2418
02:20:32.64 --> 02:20:33.64
Yeah.

2419
02:20:33.64 --> 02:20:34.64
So rings and stuff.

2420
02:20:34.64 --> 02:20:35.64
Rings for sure.

2421
02:20:35.64 --> 02:20:36.64
Rings for sure.

2422
02:20:36.64 --> 02:20:38.64
You'd like a little bit of comfort.

2423
02:20:38.64 --> 02:20:39.64
Yeah.

2424
02:20:39.64 --> 02:20:43.64
And also let the protection of your arms because when you're doing a lot of,

2425
02:20:43.64 --> 02:20:44.64
let's say, muscle ups.

2426
02:20:44.64 --> 02:20:46.64
You're doing a lot of dips or ring push ups.

2427
02:20:46.64 --> 02:20:47.64
Oh, yeah.

2428
02:20:47.64 --> 02:20:50.64
You can get the chafing on your outer arm.

2429
02:20:50.64 --> 02:20:51.64
Yeah.

2430
02:20:51.64 --> 02:20:52.64
I can dig it. So yeah, keep that in mind.

2431
02:20:52.64 --> 02:20:53.64
For sure.

2432
02:20:53.64 --> 02:20:56.64
But yeah, all cool stuff on there.

2433
02:20:56.64 --> 02:20:59.64
I think. So yeah, if you want something, get something.

2434
02:20:59.64 --> 02:21:00.64
We'll get it to you.

2435
02:21:00.64 --> 02:21:01.64
Also.

2436
02:21:01.64 --> 02:21:03.64
Subscribe to the podcast.

2437
02:21:03.64 --> 02:21:04.64
If you haven't already.

2438
02:21:04.64 --> 02:21:06.64
When I tunes or state your Google play,

2439
02:21:06.64 --> 02:21:10.64
wherever you listen to iTunes is a essential.

2440
02:21:10.64 --> 02:21:14.64
But I think so nowadays, because let's face it, man, we're just doing less.

2441
02:21:14.64 --> 02:21:19.64
You know, we're at the house more or the stuff like good, consumable stuff.

2442
02:21:19.64 --> 02:21:24.64
Good, consumable stuff podcast books, audio or otherwise.

2443
02:21:24.64 --> 02:21:30.64
Hmm. Like there's this going to be more that I think that's that's good that helps us through this scenario.

2444
02:21:30.64 --> 02:21:35.64
So subscribe to the podcast is what I go saying in a really long round about way, which is fine.

2445
02:21:35.64 --> 02:21:37.64
I mean, I guess we got we're on we're on quarantine.

2446
02:21:37.64 --> 02:21:38.64
I got plenty of time.

2447
02:21:38.64 --> 02:21:40.64
I'm really excited to agree.

2448
02:21:40.64 --> 02:21:41.64
No one cares about.

2449
02:21:41.64 --> 02:21:42.64
But it's all good.

2450
02:21:42.64 --> 02:21:44.64
And we just started another podcast called The Thread.

2451
02:21:44.64 --> 02:21:49.64
It is myself and Darrell Cooper of Margar made fame.

2452
02:21:49.64 --> 02:21:51.64
Did you famous?

2453
02:21:51.64 --> 02:21:52.64
Yes.

2454
02:21:52.64 --> 02:21:52.64
Okay.

2455
02:21:52.64 --> 02:21:59.64
So Darrell Cooper and I use on the last podcast and the podcast, the thread is launched.

2456
02:21:59.64 --> 02:22:05.64
We also have grounded podcast where we talk about life.

2457
02:22:05.64 --> 02:22:09.64
And you get to and everything in between.

2458
02:22:09.64 --> 02:22:17.64
And then we got the Warrior Kid podcast, which you may have missed a release of Johnny Kim on the Warrior Kid podcast.

2459
02:22:17.64 --> 02:22:18.64
So go check that out.

2460
02:22:18.64 --> 02:22:23.64
And also when you're talking about Warrior Kids, don't forget to check out Irish Oaks Ranch.com where

2461
02:22:23.64 --> 02:22:27.64
Eden, a Warrior Kid is making soap.

2462
02:22:27.64 --> 02:22:29.64
Making killer soap.

2463
02:22:29.64 --> 02:22:31.64
And that's the name of the soap.

2464
02:22:31.64 --> 02:22:33.64
Making killer soap. So that America.

2465
02:22:33.64 --> 02:22:36.64
And it's taking.

2466
02:22:36.64 --> 02:22:40.64
Yep.

2467
02:22:40.64 --> 02:22:43.64
Also YouTube, wherever you're YouTube channel.

2468
02:22:43.64 --> 02:22:44.64
Wash your hands.

2469
02:22:44.64 --> 02:22:45.64
Wash your hands.

2470
02:22:45.64 --> 02:22:46.64
Wash your hands.

2471
02:22:46.64 --> 02:22:47.64
That's the big deal right now.

2472
02:22:47.64 --> 02:22:48.64
Wash your hands.

2473
02:22:48.64 --> 02:22:51.64
So get yourself some, you know, some Warrior Kid soap, some killer soap.

2474
02:22:51.64 --> 02:22:52.64
Yep.

2475
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:53.64
Kill the germs, man.

2476
02:22:53.64 --> 02:22:55.64
Kill the virus.

2477
02:22:55.64 --> 02:22:56.64
Virus.

2478
02:22:56.64 --> 02:22:56.64
Virus.

2479
02:22:56.64 --> 02:22:58.64
I heard that soap kills.

2480
02:22:58.64 --> 02:22:59.64
Yeah, they're saying soap.

2481
02:22:59.64 --> 02:23:01.64
Just like soap kills the virus.

2482
02:23:01.64 --> 02:23:03.64
Yeah, or washed it off.

2483
02:23:03.64 --> 02:23:04.64
Maybe I don't know.

2484
02:23:04.64 --> 02:23:05.64
I think it kills.

2485
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:08.64
Well, because the virus can't live without a sustainable water habitat.

2486
02:23:08.64 --> 02:23:09.64
Right.

2487
02:23:09.64 --> 02:23:10.64
It's like one of those situations.

2488
02:23:10.64 --> 02:23:11.64
Okay.

2489
02:23:11.64 --> 02:23:11.64
Look.

2490
02:23:11.64 --> 02:23:14.64
I'm no germologist by biological expert.

2491
02:23:14.64 --> 02:23:15.64
Nothing like this.

2492
02:23:15.64 --> 02:23:19.64
But from what I understand, it the virus can live only for a certain amount of time on on

2493
02:23:19.64 --> 02:23:20.64
surfaces.

2494
02:23:20.64 --> 02:23:22.64
Because it can't eat nothing.

2495
02:23:22.64 --> 02:23:23.64
Right.

2496
02:23:23.64 --> 02:23:24.64
Can't live.

2497
02:23:24.64 --> 02:23:25.64
It's a virus.

2498
02:23:25.64 --> 02:23:27.64
I don't think it's eating stuff.

2499
02:23:27.64 --> 02:23:28.64
If it's living, it's eating.

2500
02:23:28.64 --> 02:23:29.64
Trust me.

2501
02:23:29.64 --> 02:23:31.64
