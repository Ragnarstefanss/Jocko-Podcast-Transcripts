Right, yeah, and that goes back to remember I forget what we were talking about like some people like they want to they want to appear to win You know, especially now you can see it on like online not you don't spend that much time at like the Dischruising Facebook, but you see You can see someone that you know I don't know there there they're they're about to Murder each other husband and wife they hate each other. It's like what are the things that that Stimulate you were motivated you or whatever that that make you like Surfing or make you like whatever it's like so a lot of it is real like basics like I like problems Hullving this way or something like that Whether someone's confronting me or someone or I got to confront someone, you know It's like this barrier, you know, you know some people they'll just step back and forth that very they'll confront you and then go back to just be like All right, I'm gonna go back to work kind of thing or school So they tend to get more wear and tear with less like as far as speedy recovery goes your muscle recover quicker than you joint Something you supplement something something something that that needs supplementation if you're getting out there at Crill oil That was a big lead in I'm too look I could say Take real oil it'll help your joints You're like okay, you know because every commercial or every what I'll be really take this it'll help this You need like some contact context and Like the information that kind of backs it up, you know gotta be real And this is real Nonetheless, Krill oil is one of the supplements That I recommend for your joints. whatever All right But these are like legit and one of the few anyway, and okay, so if you want to supplement something don't get like weight gainers You know If you want to gain weight you can do that in the correct way without supplements This is what you supplement like you know as you wear and tear your joints your joints don't get much blood flow like compared to muscles I mean that's kind of maybe not the most accurate way it For lack of entertainment it's real interesting that it's not that clear to people you know when if you're because Execution is everything idea that I think Might have been too embarrassed some some of the same ideas worth like super like super small amount All the even go further and say it's literally worth nothing just like you just like I said I guess there's some granularity of of It you know what's weird Uh So I Guess what I'm saying is and people this is the thing people probably What they think of my persona Because people think oh I'm just gonna be this uncompromising never settle all out no slack Kind of person right that's when people want it want You know want I guess want to see me has but the reality is Reason Right reason and thought Can can override values for the right reasons and That that's why we can think There's that's why we can think and there's there's actually times There's actually times when holding your values goes against your values I Actually get something like that and for me what it is Same thing but when as soon as I feel it you know what I do I go Like I go if I have it I just default because and Sometimes what bothers me sometimes you know you don't always have the opportunity like let's say I get an email Someone says hey I really like the way this happened in bubble block it'll bother me and Hey, you know what I say they say I do want to make him come like I don't make him come I go don't make him come let him come when he wants to you know you're gonna stop your membership That's cool if you want to come in on Saturdays bring him in you know you want to come in once a This is a good story one of my son's friends Who I always want all everyone to train to get through obviously with this guy's a friend of mine known for a long time It has a son that's my son's age and so they kind of grown up together and you know my son's always trained in Judit's who and I would say hey, you know when they were six years old hey have you son come in and try it came in and try to one day hate Year later now, you know a year or something like that 13 months 18 much or something Comes in a year later try as again. but Maybe you so how can you manipulate your work to to maximize what you're getting out of it Another thing is maybe take a little break from some of the activities maybe take a break from music Maybe take a break from or maybe you say oh you know what I've been doing an hour of music a day You know I'm gonna change that I'm gonna do for the next month I'm only gonna do 15 minutes just to keep my keep my skills Maintain That you could possibly go into and I would say the next step from there is You know what kind of an intelligence agency could go work for you know what kind of a person you know Could you be a person that Learns a language that learns you know some technical skills that allows you to pursue people through the interwebs You know there's a lot of terror happening on the interwebs and it needs to be stopped So who's doing that cyber war cyber wars real? so you got a it's rare to find a teacher especially if you have a teacher who doesn't like Do that you know if it's like okay, I'm gonna make an exception for this because I seen guys They're comfortable their friends with the gym kind of thing and they're like Yeah kind of a thing you know, but I mean you got to do a correct You don't you don't lose your temper or going and I'm gonna go in mad you just you can address the problem But the the key isn't about like okay, I'm good at you know Bringing up and going through barriers in regards to confrontation. We're all gonna learn something and You're gonna meet a bunch of people that are I hate using this term bunch of people that are like minded right because really can do minds be alike No, they can't be but can two people three people 300 four hundred and fifty people they're gonna be New York City that all want to get after it Can they be there? And um that kind of supports the podcast it makes Amazon or Amazon gives us like a little kickback That's a good way to support I made the comparison To a little piece of sodium like seems like this teeny tiny thing because just clicking through Amazon and shopping What that's teeny tiny three second effort But it does a big deal, you know as far as supporting We know that you're sensitive to that we don't want to be disappointed in you except if you're Brady Lisa Debbie Andy anyone that we thought don't be like hey, I like this time stamp because like we said your name on the podcast Make it except don't say that so those people kind of can't do that why not all right? so You know I think You know for one thing it sounds like you're not referring back to your time in the service on a lot but Another thing is don't a subtle thing is don't answer to you know Mr. sf just don't answer to no not saying you have to be a jerk about it so I think you made the right call Let's get in go to go to a bunch of these meetings see what they're all about and maybe you know Eventually you're saying hey boss, you know these are uncomplicated we could probably Utilize these hours better if we did something this or we did that so this is a good good straight forward method I think you made the right call and let us know how it goes.
