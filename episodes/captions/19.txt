00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jocco podcast number 19 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000 I want you to think about something.
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000 And I want you to remember it.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000 And that is that these books that I review and go through,
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000 and I want you to be able to do the written by people,
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000 real people. They're not movies.
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000 And when you picture what's happening in the book,
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000 don't picture it as a movie.
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000 Because we get inundated with so much imagery
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000 that we actually think the world is movies and television.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000 But these books, they're not movies. They're not television.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000 They're real. And these things really happened.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 They didn't happen on a screen or just in someone's mind
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000 and they weren't played by some actor.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 And when I talk about the fear that a soldier and
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000 a soldier and a girl's father was feeling, it's not part of some script.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000 It isn't just a book, it's real.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000 That's a real person, a person who really had those thoughts
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000 and those fears.
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000 And when I rattle off the figure of 800,000,
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000 tootsies killed by the Hutus and the Rwanda genocide,
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 that's not just a number.
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000 Those weren't extras in a movie.
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000 They were people.
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000 People like you and people like me,
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000 people with families and friends and hopes and dreams and jobs and lives.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000 People.
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000 And so remember that now.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000 As we join,
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000 United States Marine Corps recruit,
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000 Chuck Tatum,
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000 November 1943 at the Marine Corps recruit depot
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000 in San Diego, California.
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 Bayonet Training was a new experience.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000 None of us would forget.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000 It was tough, rugged, and required perfect physical conditioning.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 After we read the Bayonet Chapter in our guide book,
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000 Corporal Leary marches to the training range along the shore of San Diego Bay
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 to learn this lethal art of war.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000 I remember one paragraph in the Bayonet Chapter that got my attention.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000 The rifle and bayonet in the hands of a marine become a deadly combination
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 of spear, sword, club, and shield.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 At night, this combination weapon can kill silently and with surprise.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000 In hand, the hand fighting when the rifle cannot be reloaded
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000 and the use of grenades would be impractical in practical.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000 It is the decisive weapon.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000 At these times, the aggressive Bayonet fighter will win.
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000 Leary quietly explained,
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000 and assault is the critical moment of any combat,
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000 and a bayonet assault executed by determined Marines can turn the tide.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000 Men eager to engage in enemy with cold steel will strike terror in their ranks.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 He emphasized four points.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000 One, get the blade into the enemy.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000 It's the blade that kills.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Two, be ruthless, vicious, and fast in your attack.
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000 Never pause in your attack until you have won.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 There is only one winner in a bayonet fight.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000 Make sure it's you.
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000 Seek vital areas, but don't wait for an opening.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000 Make one.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 The best killing zones are the throat and the belly.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000 A solid rifle but stroke in the groin will open your enemy's guard,
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000 deliver it hard, and then go from the kill.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Four, protect yourself.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000 Your rifle and bayonet make a good shield.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Use their protection by dodging and parrying,
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000 but remember, the best defense is to attack first, strike the first blow,
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000 and follow through.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000 So they're training these young Marines.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000 Obviously, this is 1943, they're getting ready to go, and fight.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 They know for a fact they're getting ready to go and fight.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000 And you can see the psychological aspect of bayonet training.
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000 You know, it is an absolute, yeah sure, you might get in a bayonet fight,
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000 but this is a psychological training to get them aggressive,
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000 to get them in the mindset of striking first,
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000 to get them in the mindset of killing.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000 Because that's what they're getting ready to go do.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000 And as they continue to train this episode took place now there,
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000 they're a little bit further along and training,
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000 and here we go.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000 During a marching break, one hot afternoon, a Marine remarked,
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000 screw all the training.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000 I'm sick and tired of all this pussy footing around.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000 I want to get overseas and slap me a jab.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000 This remark was made in the presence of Sergeant George Lucas,
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000 who immediately cut him off saying, hold on, sonny.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000 Let me tell all of you a thing or two about the Japanese soldier.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000 Number one, he's not the caricature you see in the newspapers.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000 With bomb sight, glasses, and buck teeth,
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000 the average Japanese soldier has five or more years of combat experience.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000 Their army doesn't have a boot-dissident division like ours.
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000 Don't forget the Japs have already conquered half of the nation's in Asia.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000 Remember Pearl Harbor?
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000 Not only are they better trained than you are right now,
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000 many are old hands at combat fighting,
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000 and have a strict military code they live and die by, called Bouchito.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000 Literally translated, it means way of the warrior.
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000 With their code combined with their pledge to die for the emperor,
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000 who they consider God, they will die before surrendering.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000 Japs soldiers are well equipped and are experts with their weapons.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 They are trained to endure hardships,
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000 which would have most of you guys writing your congressmen.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000 I don't like Japs, but I respect them as fellow soldiers.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000 I learn my respect the hard way on Guadalcanal.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000 Japs are the worst, the world's best snipers,
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000 experts at the art of camouflage, and get by on a diet of fish heads and rice.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000 They will never surrender and will commit hairy carry rather than being taken prisoner.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000 Heck, they don't even have corpsmen.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000 If they are wounded, they are considered damaged goods.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:08.000 So, Sonny, mold that over, and don't ever let me hear you complain about your training again.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000 It will be a time when your life will depend on what you learn in the days ahead.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000 That's...
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000 Obviously, anyone that's listening, that's in the military, that's in law enforcement.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000 That's a message you need to get to your younger troopers.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000 That the training that you're doing, your life may very well depend on it at some point.
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000 In the near future, in the far future, you don't know,
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000 but you got to take advantage of it.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000 Now we get to when Chuck Tatum is done with boot camp,
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000 and he's checking in and he meets American hero.
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000 On my third day at Pendleton, this is Camp Pendleton for those of you that don't know what that is.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000 It's Southern California.
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000 On my third day at Pendleton, I was sitting on my bunk when I heard footsteps echoing through the empty barracks.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 I looked up, and through the hallway came a cheerful looking marine and dress greens.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000 On his armwear, the chevrons of a platoon sergeant, a hashmark adorned one sleeve,
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000 and combat ribbons decorated his left chest.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000 The lump, this is his buddies, called the lump.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000 The lump and I jumped to a meeting attention after spotting the sergeants stripes on his sleeve.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000 Looking straight at us, a smile crossing his lips,
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000 the new arrival said quietly, and with authority,
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000 at ease, men, how's everything going?
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000 On platoon sergeant John Basilone.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000 He was husky, with genial handsome looks,
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000 and his uniform had a comfortable, traveled look.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000 I noticed strands of jet black curly hair peaking out from under his garrison cap,
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000 which was set at a cocky angle.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000 While I responded to his greeting, it hit me.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000 I was in the presence of a marine core legend.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:14.000 Manila John Basilone was the first marine enlisted man to receive the Medal of Honor in World War II
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000 for actions on Guadalcanal.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000 We had heard about him in boot camp.
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000 I never had the courage to ask Basilone directly,
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000 why he had received the Medal of Honor on the canal.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000 I didn't have to ask.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000 I already knew. All American knew.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000 His story was required reading in every red blooded household.
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000 Sergeant John Basilone's Medal of Honor citation read,
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000 while the enemy was hammering at the marine's defensive positions,
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000 sergeant Basilone in charge of two sections of heavy machine guns,
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000 fought violently to check the savage and determined result.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000 Witnesses who investigated the results of the night's action during daylight
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000 remarked on the gruesome evidence of wholesale slaughter of Japanese soldiers.
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000 In front of Basilone's position, they counted 38 riddled and mangled enemy bodies
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000 and credited the kills to the fighting sergeant, using a 45-calibre pistol
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000 and his faithful machine guns.
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000 This remarkable feat was accomplished during a night when Basilone was at the same time
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000 changing spent machine gun barrels, clearing jams, and running barefoot for ammo
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000 to keep his sections guns spitting death.
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000 And so if you know anything about Basilone after he did that on Guadalcanal,
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000 he pulled him back to America.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000 And what they pulled him back to America was basically to go around and make speeches.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000 And all this is documented very well or imitated very well or shown very well
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000 in the movie The Pacific, or the series The Pacific.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000 So he gets pulled back to America and they make him go out and do these warbond
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000 speeches and ease, he's not having a good time.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 It's not who he is, right?
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000 He's just a guy that wants to get after it.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000 And so he literally goes to his commanders and says,
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000 Listen, I want to go back to fight, I want to go back to war.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000 And by the way, when he was doing those bond sales, he was living,
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 you know, complete life of luxury, he was meat movie stars, and he was getting treated like a movie star
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000 and all that did nothing for him.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000 He wanted to go back to the fight.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000 So he ends up going back now.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000 Some of the other training, I had to throw this in there.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000 One of the other sergeants that was helping train them was a guy named Bisonette.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000 And among Bisonette's other talents was his ability to instruct us in the art of Jiu Jitsu.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000 Bisonette taught us how to escape a half Nelson headlock by relaxing, holding our arm straight,
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000 and letting our body go limp.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000 Once out of the hold, we could reach back and pull the legs out from underneath our attacker.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000 Then by pulling out a K-bar knife, Bisonette showed us how to dispatch our assaylin.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000 So we're even back then, learning a little bit of the Jiu Jitsu.
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000 Oh, I know a lot of people were recognized that move if you trained.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000 And all this, of course, was to prepare for this island hopping campaign in the Pacific.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:35.000 That's what it was. And for Chuck Tatum, that started on the black sands of Ewo Jima.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000 So they hit the beach on Ewo Jima.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000 You know, after the work up going overseas, more training in Hawaii, they finally get to this point where they hit the beach.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000 And here he is on the beach for the first time.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000 And here's what Chuck Tatum says.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000 I noticed a lone marine walking back and forth on the shore, among hundreds of prone figures,
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000 kicking behind, shouting cuss words and demanding move out, get your butts off the beach.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000 He gave the marine core hand signal for follow me, a group of men responded, fascinated,
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000 I wondered why he was digging in like the rest of us.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000 As he advanced, as he advanced, I recognized that the solitary marine was none other than gun resurgent John Basilone.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Charlie company's living legend and the Marine Corps icon was headed toward me and Steve.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000 His donegaries were freshly washed and ironed.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000 His helmet strap was unhooked. He held a car-group car-bind in his left hand,
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000 and he had already ditched his cumbersome gas mask.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000 Basilone wore a light-field pack and showed no fear, as if this invasion was no more than a serious training maneuver.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000 I also saw Colonel Lewis C. Plain, the 27th Marine's executive officer.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000 He and Basilone were the only two men standing up shouting obscenities and orders.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000 The forward surge of Basilone's group carried them to our position.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000 Only Basilone and Plain defied the firestorm raging around us.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000 Move out, move out, get that off the beach, you dumb sons of bitches they screamed,
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000 kicking us right in the butts, right in left.
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000 What I thought was getting another mortar shell, falling in the same spot as before exploded 75 feet in front of Stephen Me.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000 The blast shockwave whipped up black dirt that pushed its way into my eyes and foresand into my mouth, making me gag.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000 It was uncomfortable and nasty, but my worry wasn't for myself.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.000 I hope the dirt wouldn't foul our weapon. Basilone ran up, whacked me on the helmet and pointed to the area where I thought the mortar shells had been regularly hitting.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Only when the sand and dust cleared, I could see that Basilone was pointing at the aperture of a reinforced concrete bunker or blockhouse.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000 The structure probably housed a 75 millimeter larger cannon whose field of fire was directed down the beach to our right.
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000 It was a big bastard with incredible killing power.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000 It's shells were stalling the advanced by killing men of the fourth division.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000 It may have been firing tree bursts, which is basically anti-personnel,
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000 trappled that explodes in the sky and rains down hell on ground troops.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Running 35 feet to the spot picked by Basilone, our field of fire was now diagonal to the aperture of the blockhouse cannon.
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000 We open fire again in the tracer rounds were right on target.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000 Now I was pleased. My bullets forced the enemy gunners to close their gun port.
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000 With their arm report closed, the front of the blockhouse was blind.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000 Even though it was temporarily out of commission, I still wanted to fire at it.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000 Basilone's signal to me to commence firing again and I directed and then he directed a flame thrower operator.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000 Corporal William Pegg, a marine of imposing size to repeat their precarious path taken by the demo man along our line of streaking bullets.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000 So you got some cover and move going on. You got Chuck Tayham laying down fire and now you got a flame thrower operator.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000 If you don't think about those flame throwers, they're carrying big giant looks like scuba tanks on their backs.
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000 They weighed 70 or 80 pounds.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000 And obviously these are prime targets for the enemy because the enemy hates these things.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000 So if you're wearing one of these things on your back, you're getting sniper shots at you and everyone's trying to kill you.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Basilone whacked me on the helmet to signal cease firing.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000 I didn't want to quit everything was working perfectly.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000 Why stop? I could see trace around pounding into the building and let and felt extreme satisfaction with my accomplishment.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:46.000 Nevertheless, I ceased firing as ordered and Pegg, this is the guy carrying the flame thrower, staggered under the 70 pound weight of his tanks and equipment.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000 Causes the move toward the shattered bunker walls.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000 Sticking his flame thrower nozzle into the smoldering hole, he ignited his napalm releasing 350 pounds per squareence of pressure in his tanks.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000 There was a loud roar of the sound and it looked like a fire-spitting dragon's jaw had erupted.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000 The unsuspecting and stunned men inside didn't know the horror that was about to engulf them.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000 They were cast instantly in the center of a roaring inferno and incinerating searing hell.
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000 I felt a surge of allation when the flame shot inside.
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000 It wasn't because the gruesome conflagration and agony that were about to overwhelm the enemy, but because of our success.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 No one could live through Pegg's napalm pire.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000 Sergeant Basilone had directed this operation by the book, exactly the way we'd practiced at Pendleton in Camp Taroa.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:46.000 So it's perfect cover move and the reason he sees his fire is because you have to seize fire so that the guy with a flame flow can actually get close enough.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000 Because when you're shooting at that building, there's Ricochet going all over the place so that he has to seize fire at the last moment.
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 So the guy can get right up close.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 As I lay prone again, ready to fire, Basilone stood astride my back startling me.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000 Bending over he grabbed the machine gun bail in one hand with a practice motion unlocked the tripod releasing the gun.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000 He screamed in my ear, get the belt and follow me.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000 Basilone ran toward the roof of the old blockhouse.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000 Grabbed what was left of a claw family belt my arms and I followed him at a gallop up the slopes of the ruined emplacement.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000 Standing on top, we could look down on the rear entrance as the rear entrance of the pill box.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:35.000 There was a low area 30 feet in diameter where some of the Japanese defenders had run to escape the brulist ring and furno inside.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000 Basilone cut them down firing from the hip.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000 The machine gun vibrated in his powerful arms.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000 He sprayed the enemy soldiers, helped by the Basilone bail.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000 A wooden handle fastened by wire to the barrel of the weapon that was inspired by Basilone's metal of honor and engagement on canal when he was burned carrying the hot machine gun.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000 Without the bail it would have been nearly impossible to control the blistering machine gun when it's tripod was taken off.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000 Mowing down the screaming japs was purely a mercy slaying.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000 Pitifully, the men were frantically trying to wipe away the still flaming jelly to gasoline sticking to their tortured bodies.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000 The putrid smell of burning human flesh nearly made me want to vomit.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000 Basilone's eyes contained a fury I had never seen before.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000 His jaw was rigid, clenched hard, and sweat glistened on his forehead.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000 He was not an executioner, but a true marine performing his duty.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000 For me and others who saw Sergeant Basilone's actions during our assault,
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000 his leadership encouraged were overwhelming.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000 Meanwhile, Charlie Company Rifleman and Steve Evanson shot the japs as they screamed in agony.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000 Intense assaults just completely intense.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000 And again, this is a guy that's already won the Medal of Honor, and he's out there taking charge and leading troops.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000 He has no beard, no was not required to be there.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000 He could be back in the States with, you know, in Hollywood, Rubin elbows with the movie stars.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000 But there he is back in combat, back on Ewo Jima and leading.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000 We came under intense fire from a gun, from gun placements on the slope of Mount Surabachi,
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000 less than a mile away, and took shelter in a crater made by one of our own 16-inch guns from a very large bomb.
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000 Murder rounds fired from enemy positions at the north end of the runway started to fall in our immediate area.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000 We knew someone was watching us.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000 On top of everything else, we began receiving incoming fire from offshore US Navy vessels.
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000 These were not misguided rounds, we had moved so far and fast that this rolling barrage that was intended
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000 for the entrenched Japanese defenders was now hitting us.
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000 So now we were bracketed by Surabachi by the enemy held high ground to the north and by our own Navy.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000 I always want to bring up these points of blue on blue, and how chaotic it is, no one realizes that.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000 How hard it is to decinflict fires in combat.
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Back to the book of the three dangers we faced, I feared our Navy the most.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000 I'd already seen the destructive power that their shells caused when they pounded the Japs Beach defenses.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000 I firmly believed we'd be killed if we stayed inside our giant shell hole.
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 With what seemed to be an instant common consent, everyone in our small groups started to fall back.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000 Basilone stopped the retrograde movement in our tracks by ordering digging and holding this ground come hell or high water.
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000 I'll go back for more men.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000 Manila Johns, that was a John Basilone's nickname was Manila John.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000 Manila Johns professional combat expertise had broken up a human log jam on the beach and wiped out a major Japanese defense position.
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000 Now, his moral leadership would hold together a small group of green troops in advance position.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:33.000 I gingerly peered from our position toward the landing beach 75 yards away, a group of Marines was advancing toward the runway with Basilone in the lead.
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000 This is so, so Basilone had gone back, get more troops, and now they're coming back to their position.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000 I felt momentary elation, gunny Basilone was coming back with more men.
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000 Then I heard enemy rounds falling to earth.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000 From the relative safety of our shell hole, I watched in horror as the explosions tore Basilone's body apart.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000 It was awful. It looked like Sergeant Basilone was down.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 Sometime that afternoon the word reached us, Basilone's dead.
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000 America's hero, dead. My own hero killed. How could he be dead?
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:23.000 I couldn't believe it. The legend of Basilone, a legend born in the jungles of Guadalcanal, the hero killed.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:41.000 I had read about in boot camp, who's stature had grown larger on the black and bloody sands of Ewo, as I held the machine gun belt for him. He was gone.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000 We will all miss you. I fought as tears cut paths down my grime covered face.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000 I fought of Basilone's cocky smile, curly black hair, and the way he wore his hat at a junty angle over one year.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000 He had a unique personal style in charisma.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000 For me at least, no one could ever be like Basilone.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000 America, the United States Marine Corps, and Charlie Company first battalion 27th Marines, had lost a hero.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000 Dead at 29.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000 Basilone's death strengthened our makeshift squad.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000 Resolve showed on the faces of 17 Marines told the whole dark position, come hell or high water.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000 We were receiving fire from all quarters. The shells were pouring in on us, and shrieks and house,
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000 and shredding the earth around us.
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000 Enemy gunners on Surabachi now turn their ballistic attention on us, using observed and directed fire from their lava layer.
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000 Five and shells from ships mingled in the brew of devastation, smashing across the landscape.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:10.000 Surabachi's defenders continued shooting in us, while Japanese mortar men north of the airfield pursued their deadly pounding of the Marines along the beach.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000 The invasion area was a tangle of equipment and supplies smashed vehicles and sunk in naval craft.
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000 Reserve and support units continued to pile up and congested mess.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.000 Thousands of men, the dead, the wounded, the terrified, and those trying to unload supplies swarmed over the black sand.
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000 We were now targeted by our Navy's gunfire.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000 I wasn't sure of the size and bore of the projectiles, or if they emanated from a battleship or destroyer,
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000 but I didn't know that they chilled my blood as they came shrieking in.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000 We would be safer if we withdrew to establish lines so that we would be behind instead of in front of the Navy shells.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.000 But Sergeant Bazlone had ordered us to stay, and that alone was sufficient enough reason to remain.
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000 None of us would disobey his direct order.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000 We believed it was only a matter of time before others would reach us, and we'd be free to move on.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000 Brutal.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000 And by the way, this is an example.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 This is Chuck Tatum's first combat experience.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000 His first combat experience used out of boot camp did some training in Hawaii, did some training on Taroa,
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000 and then boom.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000 Here he is.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000 Back to the book.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000 I saw an inspiring site.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000 Survivors of our Bravo Company with Sergeant Windelout in front, followed by Lloyd heard and the ammo carriers were approaching us.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000 What we were witnessing were the remnants of Baker Company.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.000 We were happily reunited with heard and the other ammo carriers, but devastated by the news.
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000 Our company had suffered severe losses during the beach assault.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000 We had 17 men killed and 51 wounded.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000 A couple hours in 17 killed and 51 wounded.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000 So now we're eased reflecting on what this morning is feeling like.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:43.000 Our first morning on Ewo, when we were pinned helplessly by mortar barrages on the black sand beaches, we were reminded of warnings by veterans who said that
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000 Japs are the world's best soldiers with a knee mortar.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000 Though chilling, those warnings weren't exaggerated.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000 Even the blunt advice of the vets didn't convey the pure horror of an enemy mortar attack.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000 It was pure hell to be caught in the open when the Japs opened up with a full mortar attack.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000 The sound of mortars swishing through the air froze my blood.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Against these invisible missiles, there was no defense.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000 If we were caught in the open, all we could do is hit the deck.
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000 A foxhole offered little protection from these high trajectory missiles because they dropped straight down on us.
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000 Again, this is a lack of control of your environment.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000 We've heard this over and over again.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000 The indirect fire, the mortars, the artillery that you can't control.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000 And it's random.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000 That's the most horrifying thing to everybody.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:59.000 The rear areas, particularly eastern or landing beaches, where support forces were working suffered a bloody pounding.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000 Sunken, brooch landing craft piled up along the beaches.
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000 Multimillions of dollars worth of valuable equipment and vessels had been systematically wrecked by deadly accurate Japanese shelling.
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000 The debris washed idly back and forth in the frothing surf.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000 Human wreckage.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000 The wounded, dead and dying littered the cold sand.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000 Engineers, C.B.s, and shore party personnel struggled to create order from the chaos.
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000 Doctors and corpsmen too often fought a losing battle against the grim reach reaper.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Watching over our battlefield.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 Armed with simple field dressings and infusions of hold blood.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000 They tried to stem the tide of human suffering and life's blood pouring into E.O.'s lava hide.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000 Our corpsmen turned into angels of mercy.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.000 They saved hundreds of Marines daily and tried to ease the pain of the hopeless cases with liberal injections of morphine.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000 Now, there's obviously a famous picture from E.O. G.M. of the Marines raising the flag on one corpsmen.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000 I think raising the flag was a corpsmen raising the flag on E.O. G.M.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000 And this is what it looked like for him.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000 This is not mean you get the impression that the fighting was over.
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000 With that, the fighting was not over.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000 When you look at the picture, we knew it was the better.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000 We hadn't even close yet, but they did take a prominent terrain feature.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000 This is what it was like for Chuck Tatum.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000 As the 26 Marines pressed their attack, enemy mortars began falling in our rest area.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000 Japanese weapons were capable of firing from one end to the island to the other.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000 With thousands of Marines crawling around in concentrated areas, it was an easy task to keep our advancing troops under fire.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000 From our reserve positions near the beach, it was possible to witness the battle raging for the possession of Mount Serabachi.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.000 Through sergeant windows field glasses, we took turns watching the upward progress of our men as they approached the steep rocky slopes.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000 It appeared the 28th Marines were at the base of the volcano.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000 He's from the battle obscured my vision, but we could tell that it was one hell of a fight going on.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000 It felt sickening to be in reserve, watching a battle where men were dying almost before our eyes.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000 It seemed like watching a motion picture from the wrong end of a telescope, if that makes any sense.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.000 At about 10 30 a.m., Steve slapped me on the back and pointed third Serabachi shouting,
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000 Tadeum, do you see that?
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000 I twisted around and saw stars and stripes clearly on the peak waving in the breeze.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000 The 28th Marines were now King of Imo Iwo Jima's Hill.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000 Cheers from thousands of Marines and roared and reverberated across the island.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.000 I felt a surge of pride. I was proud to be a Marine and proud to be an American fighting on Iwo,
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000 but we weren't attending a picnic.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000 Live shells were still dropping on us throughout Iwo.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000 Steve and I soon forgot the flag raising, as we basically re-engineered our foxhole, digging deeper into mother Iwo.
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000 Because like it or not, the word was that the Japanese still occupied more of Iwo than the Marines.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:44.000 To prove that they were still the main landlord, the enemy sent a message via concentrated artillery and mortar attack.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:34:08.000 Now, a couple days go by and Chuck Tadeum's feet are getting messed up from being in socks and they're wet.
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.000 And so you need to get some clean socks and there's basically one place to get them.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000 Given the condition of my feet, I knew additional socks were imperative.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000 I asked Sergeant Wendell for permission to make a run to the dead man or casually piled to look for a pair.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000 The dead man or casually piled contained clothing, equipment and weapons of dead or wounded Marines.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000 I had to go a quarter of a mile, and as I hobbled there, I felt uneasy and a big guilty about the prospect of being a scavenger.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000 But I had no choice.
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000 The demands and horrors of Iwo's battlefield left no other ready solution to the problem of resupply.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000 I hesitantly picked up a pack only to drop it instantly.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000 There was a bullet hole straight through it.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000 I found another one intact and solely lifted it, trying to see the stencil name of its previous owner.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000 Curiosity got the best of me. It wasn't anyone I knew.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Undoing the straps, I carefully removed the contents.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000 There were two perfectly clean and dry pair of green wool socks.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000 I saw you lo and folder lay at the bottom of the pack and it felled the ground as I shook out the contents.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000 I opened the folder.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000 A photo of a smiling girl beamed at me.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.000 All my love to Joe, Maryland, was neatly written across the bottom of the photograph.
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.000 I carefully replaced the folder in the pack and set a prayer for Joe and Maryland.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:09.000 I remember when you were a kid.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000 You were taken gear from dead and wounded Marines.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:31.000 Now they're out continuing to press through, continuing to make slow progress but they are making progress.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000 Leaving our machine guns, we spread out in an infantry style formation to comb the area.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000 Our search for snipers was fruitless but we did find a dead enemy soldier in a clump of bushes.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000 The smell, rotting his corpse, almost made me puke.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000 The stench could gag a maggot, Steve said, bloated.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000 The body was a spider trap.
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:08.000 And almost unrecognizable as having been a human being.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000 His uniform was charred so I thought that it might have been hit by a flame thrower.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000 Bloding and caused the tunic buttons of the canavers uniform to pop off.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000 There note was no skin on what had been the face but the future flesh had scabbed over.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:34.000 Swims of flies were attacking the torso and maggots were wiggling in the eyes.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000 I guess we were lucky. He will had no buzzards.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 A rifle lay beside the body. No one touched it.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000 They might be booby trap. Don't screw with it.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000 Later, resting in our reserve area, I looked at my watch.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000 Saw it was 330 pm and decided to eat a K ration.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000 Seeing the body of dead jabs had become so commonplace,
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000 I could erase this one from my thoughts.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000 It had nothing to do with me.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000 I had become as hardened to death as an undertaker.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000 Moving on.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:26.000 I was causing to consolidate the men were hit with grenades, mortars, and machine gun fire from their exposed flanks and rear.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000 This is taking place as there.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Performing in a soul on a hill.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000 Cleverly the Japanese had sprung a trap, mortar fire from behind 362 alfa.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Caves in front of the cliff opened up, and alfa companies first puttune was the hardest hit in curing heavy casualties.
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:59.000 At 130 pm, alfa company had to pull back as quickly as the hail of machine gun fire and bullets would allow.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000 More men were lost trying to save the wounded.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:14.000 The work that had gone into arming and fortifying hit hill 362 alfa, the Japanese version of the Magino line in France, was awesome.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 And it was serving its designers' purpose.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000 It was stopping the marines.
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000 The trap sprang shut and we were in it.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Japanese mortars winged in, greeting our attack.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000 We took cover. Machine guns and rifle fire erupted from every crack and crevice in hill 362 alfa.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000 The mountain was spewing death and destruction from every fissure in its volcanic hide.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000 There was no way to fight back. We couldn't see our enemy.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000 But they could see us, and they had us dead in their sights.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000 We scrambled over the rocky terrain without cover.
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000 Steve and Van carried our machine gun followed by pops, whipped comb, and Lloyd heard our ammo bearers.
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000 An orchestra of marine and jab borders, machine guns, rifles and artillery created a roaring shrieking clamor,
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000 inducing terror throughout the ranks, stopping our forward momentum.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000 With mounting casualties and nightfall approaching, we consolidated our positions in dug in.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000 We were literally nose to nose with our mortal enemies.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000 Some of the enemy physicians were less than 40 feet in front of us.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000 The days fight had cost the battalion and estimated 100 casualties for gain of 200 yards.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000 A typical days fighting on E-Wale.
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000 Going forward, continuing to push.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000 Back to the book, mortar, machine gun, and targeted rifle fire torn to the company.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000 Men started dropping on all sides, dirt ripped at my eyes, and the clamor of explosions and bullets pounded against my ears.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000 The ridge we faced was alive with an enemy that was impossible to see or kill.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000 Captain Manchine kept forward, crept forward. He could see the chaos and disorder of our situation.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000 Standing up with a cool, purposeful manner, he took charge.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000 He looked as calm as though he were directing a training maneuver at Camp Pendleton.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000 We organizing the company, he directed a withdrawal from our untenable position.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000 He seemed to be everywhere at the proper moment.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Personally assisting wounded, making sure everyone got out of the japs trap.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000 Captain Jimmy Maynchine never ran out of courage.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000 And his selfless, heroic actions saved a problem from destruction.
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000 But he did run out of luck.
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000 He was the last man still in the trap.
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000 When he attempted to withdraw towards our line, Japanese soldiers used him for target practice,
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000 riddling his chest with multiple bullets wound killing him.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000 Reacting to the loss of our favorite officer,
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000 the company found a collective fury and determination.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000 We organized, we rushed to the offensive.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Because we were too close for artillery, fire support, or air strikes,
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000 the fight developed in a classic Marine infantry attack.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000 Small clusters of men advanced by fire and fast movement until they found
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000 an obliterated each concealed strong point or individual enemy soldier.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000 Vans gun suddenly stopped.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000 Looking their way, I saw that he and Steve were down.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000 Suddenly I was overwhelmed with rage.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000 And all the anger I had stored up against the Japanese burst out.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000 Without thought or hesitation, I sprinted into Vans position.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000 Vand had been hit in the back near the right shoulder, and the round and exit it is left side.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000 Steve had been gut shot twice, and it was white with shock.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000 By reflex, he was holding his hands to his stomach, to stem the bleeding.
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000 Blood poured out around his fingers.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000 As he pulled his legs into the fetal position, I could see the pain on his pinched face.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Knowing that the japs with shoots, Steve and Vand, as they rolled around on the ground,
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000 I grabbed their machine gun into my arms and fired from the hip, like Basilone did,
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000 sending lead into the cave to suppress enemy fire.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000 I was in a hot rage and swivel the gun about, so its bullets would ricochet throughout the cave
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000 and decimate those bastards who shot my friends.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000 Clouds of rock dust billowed from the cave's mouth.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000 I poured fire into the cave's black mouth until the belt round out.
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000 For a second, I stood there.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000 The 30 cows barrel smoking.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000 The japs who had shot Steve and Vand were silent.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000 Nothing came from the cave, no bonsai charges, no moans, nothing, just smoke and dust.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000 My senses returned.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Dropping the gun, I turned to Steve and Vand.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000 I knew they were dying.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000 I screamed, corpsman!
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000 With the cave suppressed and the area safe,
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000 Doc Marsh ran to Steve and knelt over him, then turned to Vand.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000 Seconds tick past, seeming like hours.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000 I waited for Docs orders.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Her grand out to join us, and help me and Marsh drag Vand and Steve to cover.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000 Marsh injected Vand with morphine, while I broke open Steve's first aid kit,
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000 and handed the service, heret to Marsh.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000 He shoved the needle into Steve's flesh.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000 I screamed, stretch your bears.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000 This day of violence, fear, killing, and maming,
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000 left me on the edge of despair.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000 Sergeant Windle talked to me in a personal and marine way.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000 Tatum, he said, let's go, we've got a job to do.
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000 My mind slipped into a productive mode,
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000 when events beyond my control took over.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000 From that afternoon on, I purposely tried to avoid getting to know
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000 the replacement ammo humbers, and the Marines filling the slots of those we had lost.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000 I didn't want to know their names, where they were from,
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000 or to see their girlfriends pictures.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000 I didn't want to get attached to them,
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000 and suffered through the loss of close friends again.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000 The war was still going on 30 feet ahead.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000 I wanted revenge.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000 Unseen, our enemy continued to punish us,
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000 as we consolidated our gains for the day and attempt to declare the newly seized territory.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000 A new private, a replacement called me the edge of a bluff.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000 He had spotted enemy soldiers, clustered in a pill box, and was trying to show me their location.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000 I couldn't see what he had found, and was sighting down his arm, while he pointed.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000 Our head side by side.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000 All of a sudden a crack rang out.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 He jerked forward, and was dead before I could catch him.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000 A sniper's bullet had hit him between the eyes.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000 Instinctively, I called for a corpsman,
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000 although the man was beyond help.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 When the medic came up, he said,
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000 I can't take it anymore. I can't go on. If they want to, they can just shoot me right now.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000 The blood that covered the medic's uniform wasn't his own.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000 Medics are considered non-combatants under international law,
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 but the japs didn't care about international law.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000 After ten days on Ewo, he hadn't fired a shot.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000 He was too busy stopping the flow of others' blood.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000 I didn't know what to tell him.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000 I put my arm around his shoulders and said, I understand.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000 It didn't seem to help.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000 Staring straight ahead, he cried, I just want out of this war.
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000 Then someone else yelled,
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000 corpsman, the medic tried his eyes, picked up his kit,
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000 and left to go patch up another wounded Marine.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.000 Now it's 12 days into the invasion, so D plus 12.
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000 March 3rd was a bad day for replacement officers.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000 Lieutenant Scarcia, Harrington, and Leach,
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000 all assigned from the 27th replacement draft, were killed in action.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000 We've almost no experience commanding troops in combat or anywhere else.
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000 Second Lieutenant had been cranked out of officer-candidate's school
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000 and chronic over junior wholesale.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000 The Marine Corps created its new leaders with assembly line speed.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000 Harrington and Leach were commissioned officers for five months
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000 when they were told to lead battoons in deadly combat.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000 Brave inexperienced pinch hitters, or substitute quarterbacks
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000 in a game of death, they never even knew the men they were trying to lead.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000 Now he gets to the 14th day.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000 By mid-morning, word swept through our ranks.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000 Colonel Butler has been killed.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000 Butler had been writing in a Jeep to a conference at the Regimental Command Post in order to save time.
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Along the way, he decided to check out the terrain he impotisipated
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000 will be his men's next objective when the vehicle approached a trail junction near
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000 old sugar mill.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000 His party took a direct 47-millimeter round hit from a Japanese anti-tank
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000 and he was killed instantly.
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000 The driver and NCO accompanying him were seriously wounded.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000 He was another E-WO tragedy, but not the last.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000 Shortly after Colonel Butler's death, a sniper killed my squadmate and camped
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000 Tarowore placement.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:27.000 PFC Lavore Jenkins of freedom Wyoming has arrested between assaults.
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000 Lavore was 18 days short of celebrating his first year in the corps.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000 Jenkins lost, meant the first squad was down to three members.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000 Billy Jill, call for our baby face marine, go for Gus, Henderson, and Ralph Jeffers.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:50:00.000 Now they were actually pulled off the line for a bit and had a little bit of a rest.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000 During our day of rest, my headache grew worse and I consulted a corpsman.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000 My ears ring, I told them.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000 Not impressed, he answered, it's normal for ears to ring in combat.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000 He gave me some aspirin for my headache and asked, anything else wrong?
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000 I showed him my leg wound.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000 He jokingly said, too bad your wound isn't deeper if it was.
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000 You'd have a ticket off this damn dilund.
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000 The aspirin didn't touch my headache, it grew worse.
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000 My ears rang constantly and I felt nauseous.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000 I was getting weaker and I knew it.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000 And so what we've got now is the initial stages of combat fatigue.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000 He started to feel it.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000 When tremella sits one of his other guys, when tremella's gave me hell about something
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000 and my mind was hazy and numb.
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000 I didn't answer him.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:09.000 About midday, the word came down, move out.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000 Our day of rest was over, I reckoned, roofily.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000 We formed up to move out in a spread formation and immediately began taking more to fire.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000 I mean, it's just a nightmare.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000 Take cover, window-hawed, hallowed.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000 As we scattered like a cuvvy of quail seeking refuge.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000 Around hit a few yards from me, my pulse raced and my battle senses told me to move.
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000 Sprinting, I ran for a rock outcropping 30 yards away.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000 When I was halfway to safety, a close-round knocked me to the ground.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 Mortar artillery shelling it scared the hell out of me since D-Day.
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000 But the fear I felt now was different.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000 My hands trembled.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000 Fortunately, the barrage stopped quickly.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000 I changed smoke to settle down.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:03.000 My head pounded and I gulp down, can't teen water until my stomach was upset.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000 My legs felt paralyzed like a childhood nightmare in which I wanted to run, but couldn't.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000 The company moved out, but I stayed where I was.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000 All I could think was fuck the war, fuck the japs, and fuck this whole island.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000 A flood of ever of other fuck everything served through my tangled thinking process.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000 Then awareness that I was alone and the fear of becoming a snickers snipers target prompted me to move.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000 There was another conclusion.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000 If I stayed where I was, the Marine Corps would shoot me as a deserter.
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000 Self-preservation instincts kicking in, I told myself, get off your butt and start moving.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000 I looked for my vanished company.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000 Eventually, I heard someone calling my name.
00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000 Through the hazy vision, I saw Sergeant Window walking toward me.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000 When he was close enough, he looked at me.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000 Tatum, are you okay? He asked?
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000 Let's join the company and don't worry, you're going to be okay. You're going to make it.
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:17.000 I followed him without argument or objection.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000 Before we set in for the evening at 3.30 pm, Window said to me, Tatum, I'm sending you back.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000 Glancing at tremelles, he added, you're out of here too. You're both finished.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 Get the hell back, both of you.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000 The trek to the rear and red beach, too, are starting point 15 days ago, took an hour.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000 There were no tears in my eyes. I had combat fatigue.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000 I was just going to get out of here.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000 So, they're done.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000 And they get pulled off the island.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:19.000 They get pulled off the island. They get pulled off the island.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000 So, they're out there on the ship.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000 Obviously, they're out there with a bunch of other marines.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.000 Back to the book, Tramelas and I felt completely out of place.
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:41.000 We were among seriously wounded marines, and I almost felt guilty that I wasn't wounded physically.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000 Our wounds were two our minds, and there were no bandages that could be applied to them.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000 There were no drugs that we could take that would erase the images of war that filled our heads.
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000 Mother nature, where the assistance from modern medicine, could heal the flesh.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000 But the mind is different.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:09.000 You can never forget the pain you suffered in a place like Ewo Jima, and the scars will always be there.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000 Tramelas and I had been labeled SSCF or shell-shocked combat fatigue.
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000 This label had a negative connotation.
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000 I suppose this was the result of the general misunderstanding of this type of condition.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000 It did not denote a lack of courage or resolve to fight.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000 It was a condition caused by the inability to continue past physical or mental exhaustion.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000 Most marines who suffered combat fatigue were the ones who had survived to fight another day,
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000 and another day, and another day.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.000 The lucky ones got the million dollar wound on the first day and lived to recover.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000 They didn't go back into the siege time and time again, as Tramelas and I had done.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000 Each day, to see the decimation of young lives, the deaths of buddies who were closer than brothers,
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.000 boys whose parents hopes would be dashed by a message from the Navy saying,
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000 we regret to inform you.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000 Most people never have to witness the killing of someone they are close to,
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000 a loved one who is shot or decapitated.
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Watch a brother whose face is filled by the look of deep shock that precedes death.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000 They never feel the helplessness of watching life bleed out of a mortal being.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000 Those who know war know of what I speak.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000 I decided on Sipan that I would never apologize for my actions on Ewo Jima,
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000 or for falling prey to combat fatigue.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000 I gave it my all.
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:19.000 Obviously in this day and age, we've been dealing with a lot of combat fatigue, PTSD.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000 And I think one thing as I read through this,
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.000 I thought back to Colonel Hackworth's book and about face.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000 One of the ways that he describes it is he says that basically people have a cup.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000 And different size cups, different people have different size cups,
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000 and the cups are to get filled up.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000 And if it gets filled up, it's done. You're done. You can't take anymore.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000 And you just gotta go away.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000 And this is the first time as I read this,
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000 obviously, Junk Tatum showed extreme courage over and over again.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000 And he points out the fact that there's not that many guys that went day after day after day
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000 and we're lucky enough to not get wounded.
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000 Or I guess you could say unlucky enough.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000 And eventually they reach a point where they can't take anymore.
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000 Now you do get some guys that can handle more.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000 And I thought of this today, it's just nature.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000 It's just how you're formed.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:44.000 And I'm not going to be mad at someone because they can't bench press 500 pounds.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000 Some people don't have that. That's not part of their physical makeup.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000 That's not part of their physical constitution or their mental constitution.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000 And it's the same thing here.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000 Some people just have a higher propensity for this type of mental stress so they can handle it more.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:10.000 And that doesn't mean that someone that can't bench press 500 pounds like me doesn't mean
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000 a pathetic person.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:19.000 No, it just means that I just didn't naturally inherit those genetics that give me the ability to bench press 500 pounds.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000 Now, and it's the same thing with what you inherit mentally.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000 And some people, their cup,
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000 get filled up, especially when they are lucky or unlucky enough as we just discussed,
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:40.000 to survive day after day after day after day after day and 14 days of thinking that you're going to die
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000 and seeing your friends get wounded or killed.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Again, even back then,
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000 oh, he said it had a negative connotation almost like you weren't mentally tough enough.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000 Right, like you had the luxury of not getting shot and all this stuff.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Right, and he's still couldn't hack it almost.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000 And my point is number one to support what he says,
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000 you've take anybody, anybody's going to have a breaking point.
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000 And the breaking point is going to be a different spot.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000 And he was like, we're saying he was either unlucky or lucky enough depending on how you look at it
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000 to survive 14 straight days of this.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000 And that was where he wrote some people would reach a breaking point in five days,
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000 but we never would know that.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000 Some people would last a hundred days, but we wouldn't know that because they got killed.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000 Yeah, meanwhile, when you get hit, how you called it, the million dollar wound.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000 So when you get hit, everyone's going to recover from that.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000 The Flash and Modern Medicine, it heals it.
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000 So yeah, that's why you called it the million dollar wound because it's like,
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000 oh, you can weigh you locked out.
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000 Yeah, you know, you didn't have to face these terrible horrors that lied beyond day,
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000 10, day, 11, 14, 15, you know, and then it just keeps going until you fall off.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000 Yeah, and you're going to break at some point, you know, and everyone is in like I said,
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000 it's just the way you're made up as your genetic code.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000 Maybe you can take it for seven days, maybe you can take it for 28 days,
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000 but the most important thing that he says,
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000 that if there's vets out there that think, man, I didn't do enough wrong.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Listen, what he says, I decided on side panel, that's where they weren't not a recover.
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000 I decided on side panel that I would never apologize for my actions on Ewo Jima,
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000 or for falling prey to combat fatigue, I gave it my all.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000 And that's all anybody could ask.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000 Now he dedicates this book.
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000 And here's the book dedication.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:05.000 This book is dedicated to my brothers, the Marines who fought the Japanese army on one of the darkest islands on earth, Ewo Jima.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000 On our voyage to Ewo, we had dreams and plans for our futures.
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000 We were young and buoyant.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000 Our hearts were filled with love for our families, our buddies, our country.
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000 We wanted to survive to come home together.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000 Then we felt the flames of that Pacific in Fernou.
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:51.000 To my Marine brothers who fell on that rock, I owe every day of the life I've led to you,
01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:05.000 to the center of life.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000 And here is a roster of some of the people that he knew.
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000 On Ewo Jima, we've taken a Colonel John Butler, first battalion commanding officer, killed an action.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000 Captain James Jimmy Mayan-Chain, killed an action.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000 Second Lieutenant John A. Drager, died of wounds.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000 Gunnery Sergeant Stanley Blacky Cavato, died of wounds.
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone, killed an action.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000 PFC Bruno Spike, Mirzwa, killed an action.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000 PFC Loyal Lamon, killed an action.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:07.000 PFC Clifford Steve Evanson, killed an action.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000 PFC Carl Tex Thompson, killed an action.
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:24.000 Corporal Frank Post-Pickle, killed an action.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000 PFC Lavor Jenkins, killed an action.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000 Corporal George Chelf, killed an action.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:50.000 Private Ralph Jeffers, killed an action.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000 PFC Edward J. Tucker, killed an action.
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:07.000 In those are some of the names.
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:26.000 Some of the people of the 6,821 sailors and marines that were killed in action.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000 PFC C.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000 On a place where the Marine Corps awarded 27 Medal of Honors,
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:49.000 which was a quarter of all the Medal of Honors that were awarded during World War II.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:59.000 And I want to close this out, not with a Medal of Honor citation,
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:07.000 but with a Silver Star citation for PFC Edward J. Tucker.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:16.000 For Conspicuous Galantry and Intrevity as a squad leader,
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000 serving April Tune of Company Bravo, first battalion,
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:30.000 27th Marines, fifth Marine Division, in action against Japanese enemy forces on Ewo Jima,
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000 volcano islands, 14 March 1945.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:44.000 Heedless of his own painful wounds and refusing evacuation in order to remain with his men,
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:51.000 in continuing self and assault against the bitterly defending Japanese private first-class Tucker,
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000 unhesitatingly braved, a deadly hail of hostile, fought rifle fire and machine gun fire
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000 to rescue a wounded Marine lying in an exposed position.
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000 Although mortally wounded, while administering first aid,
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000 to his stricken comrade, private first-class Tucker,
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000 by his unselfish courage and devotion to duty, had strengthened the morale
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000 and fighting spirit of his entire company.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000 Thereby reflecting great credit upon himself
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000 and the United States Naval Service.
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000 So as I have said, and as I always say,
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000 war brings out the worst in us.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:53.000 But it can also bring out the best, and there are thousands and thousands of heroes.
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Like PFC, Edward J. Tucker, known and unknown,
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000 that have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, for the Marine Corps,
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:20.000 for their battalion, their company, their platoon, their squad, and for their friends.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000 And I want you to remember that too.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000 That in all that darkness in that black sand,
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000 and all that evil in the world, there are heroes and brave men,
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000 and men that don't take lives, but give their lives for their friends.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000 And while we do talk about evil,
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000 also always remember that the world is also filled more filled with good men
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000 and good women and good people.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000 And remember those people,
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000 in moments of darkness,
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:26.000 and temptation, let them inspire you to follow in their footsteps.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:41.000 Because there's no doubt that the example has been set.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000 So, it's...
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:57.000 It's really just another situation.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000 When I think about the dichotomy of war and the dichotomy of combat,
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000 and how it brings out the worst in people,
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000 but it also brings out the best in people.
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000 And I think that in order to appreciate the best in people,
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.000 you got to recognize what they're up against,
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000 got to recognize what we're up against.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000 And you got to see that example,
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000 that example of people that shine,
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000 they shine in those circumstances.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000 And if they can rise like that,
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000 in those circumstances, in those situations,
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000 facing such horror,
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000 well, then maybe we can rise a little bit too.
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000 Then maybe we can shine just a little bit brighter,
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:29.000 and bring a little bit more light into the world.
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000 And I'd say echoed looks like I set us up for another rough transition here.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000 Yeah, I think so.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000 My apologies.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000 But it'll offer a bit of a contrast, right?
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000 Yes, we will, like I said, this reflects life.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000 Yeah, and you go through horrible things,
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000 and you'll be facing some tough times.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000 That's what life does to you.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000 And then a little while later, you'll be laughing.
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000 And that's the way life is.
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000 Yeah, that's the way this podcast seems to go to.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000 Yeah, you have a bad day at work.
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000 You come home, boom, you're son and daughters.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:21.000 God, straight-a's.
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000 There you go.
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000 They got their report card, right?
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000 Let's go to the Interweb questions.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000 I'll for praying gives you weird dreams.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000 By the way, if you take it before you go to sleep.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.000 I take it.
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000 I have weird dreams regarding this.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:43.000 Right, right.
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.000 Okay, actually, you know what?
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.000 They don't give you weird dreams.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000 They give you a weird awareness of your dreams.
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000 I'm not making that as like an official claim.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000 I'm saying that's what happens with me.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000 And that's why here literally everyone else who
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000 takes me before they go to bed.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000 Yeah, that doesn't really happen to me for some reason.
01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000 Because it's not it's not a stimulant.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000 By the way, you still go to sleep good.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000 Yeah, I take it before I go to bed.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000 Oh, you know, that's why you're so smart.
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000 Jacob, I want to hear you thoughts on over detachment.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000 I'm a police officer.
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000 And I'm sure military personnel experience the same over detachment.
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000 Defined as emotional separation from moments which require emotional response in family and profession.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000 So what do you thought about over detachment?
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000 Yeah, this is definitely obviously I'm always encouraging people to be able to detach.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000 Right, because that's how you get your emotions out of a situation.
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000 But this happens to what my brother right here is talking about.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000 This police officer saying, hey, sometimes we think about being over detached.
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000 And there's something you need to watch out for.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000 Because you don't want to go through your life where you have no more emotions.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000 Because they're not living a life than you're a robot or a machine.
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000 And you don't, you need to have emotions.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000 So what as I thought about this, I thought, how did I watch out for that?
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000 And it's something that creeps in on anybody that does anything.
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000 We could even have to be a cop or a military person.
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000 I mean, you could do if you're any job that you have, where you have,
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000 we can't just get all emotional about stuff.
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000 If you're in finance, if you're anything, you could just become detached.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.000 So how do you do, how do you look out for what one thing that I did?
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:34.000 And still do is compartmentalize and draw little segregation between work and home.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000 And there's a really easy way to do that, especially for people that are cops or it doesn't matter what you do.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000 Whatever that uniform is that you wear at work, whether you're a cop, whether you're military,
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000 whether you wear in a business suit at work, when you get home, take off that uniform.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000 Take it off.
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000 Matter of fact, if you can't take it off before you get home, you know, leave it at the office.
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000 Yeah, because you want to leave that there.
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000 And when you get home, put on the home close.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000 Right?
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000 The t-shirt, the comfortable t-shirt, the flip flops, the shorts,
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:20.000 be relaxed at home. But be physically in a different uniform at home,
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.000 not even a uniform in a different change your appearance and therefore change your state of mind a little bit.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000 Different music.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000 Right? Whatever it is that you listen to at work, go to something different at home.
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000 You know, when you're going into work, listen to the first hour of jockel podcast,
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000 when you're coming home, you listen to the second hour.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000 Right?
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000 That's how we do it.
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000 You know, you want to have a different attitude.
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000 The different language, right?
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000 Don't come home thrown around the in acronyms from work.
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000 Yeah.
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000 And you know what I've talked about this before.
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000 I never swore at home.
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000 I swore like hell at work, but I never swore home.
01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000 So I was using a different language on.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000 I was completely compartmentalizing what I was doing at work and what I was doing at home.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000 And then check out your posture.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000 What are you standing around your house like?
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.000 Are you standing all cross-armed and glaring at people?
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000 Hmm.
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000 Let's just ask the question.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000 Are you notified weaver stands when you're talking to your wife?
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000 Get ready to do a quick drop.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000 It's like a pistol shooting stand.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000 That's, no, no.
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000 You know, are you, are you digging for underhooks if your kids find you?
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000 You know what I mean?
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000 Are you looking to get to take down?
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000 No.
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000 You want to relax, right?
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000 And another thing is find some, you know,
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000 maybe it's, maybe group of people that are involved in your work.
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000 That can be hard.
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000 And luckily for me, my wife made friends that were outside of the sealed community.
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000 And so I got a bunch of buddies that were, had nothing to do with the sealed teams.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000 They had their friends of their wife, friends and husbands of my wife.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000 So I had a whole group of people that I still hang out with all the time.
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000 They have nothing to do with the military at all.
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000 In fact, many of them are as bad as far as you could get from military personnel as one could imagine.
01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000 And, but that's another thing that helped me segregate the two.
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000 Now, of course, I'm not saying you've got to let your guard down a hundred percent because you shouldn't do that.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:21.000 But you shouldn't let it down enough that you can enjoy life.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:29.000 And you got to detach sometimes.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000 Now, that being said, because it's going to, it is going to help you make good decisions.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000 But there are also times where it's not good.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000 And if you're detached and your wife's trying to talk to you, it's not going to be good.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000 So open up. You've got to show some emotions.
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000 And one of the things about being detached, here's a paradox.
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000 You've got to be detached enough so that you recognize when you're not showing enough emotion.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000 Yeah. You know what I'm saying?
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:02.000 If you're so detached that you being detached, how you to realize that, oh my God,
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:05.000 I'm not showing any emotions at all. I'm too detached.
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.000 Yeah. So don't try and be a tough guy that's just being detached because if you're detached enough, you're realize that you're being too detached.
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:20.000 Yeah. And there is too deep, well, obviously, like if you're, you're in a debate, argument, fight, whatever with your girlfriend's life.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000 Right. And you're detached. Let's say you know you're right. Let's say you weren't right.
01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000 You know, all that is nothing to do with anything when you're arguing with your wife.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000 You're just being honest speaking now. In my experience, yeah.
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000 I would agree with that in my experience.
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000 But here's the thing though, because you're looking at the story.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:47.000 I just want to make that same again. When you're an argument with like your wife or your close friend or any of your boss, your subordinate,
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:52.000 whether you're right or not, is almost doesn't matter at all.
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000 Yeah.
01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000 What matters is what you're trying to do with direction you're trying to move.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000 And it's winning the argument being right or wrong.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000 Going to help you move in direction when moving. That's the real question.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000 Yeah. So detached for a minute and figure out the answer to that question.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.000 Yes.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000 Because I never care if I'm right or wrong. That's not never my goal.
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000 Well, in an argument with something.
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000 Do I say never?
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000 I usually don't care the most part for the most part.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:26.000 Yeah. Yeah. And I think a lot of times, a lot of times, people do care whether right or wrong.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000 Oh, my God. They do. They care. People go psychol.
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000 Right. Being right or wrong.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000 Yeah.
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000 I'm proved beyond like reasonable doubt.
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000 All questions that I'd, I'm 100% right. You're wrong.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000 Yeah. And so even when people are wrong, they'll still want to just win the argument.
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000 So that's that's that's bad.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000 What can be even worse is when you are right.
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.000 Yet the other person is, let's say your wife is emotional because man, this is a known thing that.
01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:03.000 The girls generally speaking, they, they want to know that you care more so than they want you to fix their problem.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.000 Like if someone has, if your wife is having a problem at work or something, they just want you to care that that's going on with them.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000 They don't want like all this trick in advice, you know, but that generally speaking, I'm not going to categorize there.
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000 It's not black and white, but generally speaking. So let's say you're really debate or something.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000 I say, you're an argument, you're going to fight.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000 And you know you're right. And let's say you are right. If you're all detaching being like, well, here's the logic behind why I'm right.
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000 And you have this airtight case. That's not going to help your relationship.
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000 She wants to know first of all that you care. She's mad. She said she's whatever.
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000 Do you care about that? That's the way you win. Not the argument. That's the way you win the situation.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000 Yes. You know? And so not only are you, not only do you get out of the fight,
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:53.000 but you're the good guy. And really that's part of the reason why she likes you because you're the good guy.
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000 That's a win-win group.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000 So yeah, that's just a time question why my wife likes me.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000 It's all good.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000 Yeah.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000 Yeah, no, that's it.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000 But yeah, so detaching, you see that, but be attached because you care.
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000 Yes. Yes.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:21.000 And show that you care. And then when you go back to work, your cop, your military person, your business person,
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000 put your uniform back on, put your boots back on, put your body on your back on, lock and load,
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000 and get back into detachment zone.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000 And move forward. Now, the question kind of implies this too. And I will point this out.
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000 I mean, at work, you also can't just be detached all the time because you're a leader.
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000 You're in a leadership position. So you can't just walk around, just detachment,
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000 but we know you got to show motion. You got to relate to the people you're working with.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000 You got to be a human so that they follow you or you follow them or the case may be.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:56.000 So the detachment, you have to be detached enough to recognize when you're being too detached.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000 Yeah.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000 Let's hear it out.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000 Yeah.
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000 Next question.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000 I was hoping to get your thoughts on bullying. If your child is being bullied, what would you tell him or her?
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:17.000 This is, I guess, a little bit of a softball for me to throw this question out because you know what I'm going to say.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000 Get your candidate to get your candidate to immediately.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.000 Get them in there and let them start to learn what it's like to deal with people physically.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:34.000 And it will build up their confidence and it won't be a false confidence. It'll be a real confidence because they will know how to handle themselves.
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:41.000 They will have people that are trying to take them down to the ground and trying to choke them and they will learn to stop that from happening
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000 and they will learn to do it to other people when warranted.
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:52.000 So that's how you prevent bullying in my opinion. You also get them to start doing pull ups, push ups, dips.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000 You get them to do a little bit of boxing.
01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:09.000 Maybe even a little mojtai. I'll tell you at our gym over the years we've probably had half a dozen kids that have come in specifically because they were getting bullied at school.
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000 And every one of those cases within three months, four months, maybe six months at the outset.
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000 The parents are coming to me and saying he's not getting bullied anymore.
01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:30.000 And sometimes there's that incident where I've had a few students that have, you know, these are kids or 10 years old getting picked on, getting picked on, getting picked on.
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.000 And all of a sudden they start training to get to and then one day they choke out the bully.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000 And they never get picked on again.
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000 And they're confident and they're not jerks about it. They become defenders because they know what it's like to be bullied so they don't like to see other people get bullied.
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:58.000 So I would say, you know, get your kids into GJ2 if they're getting bullied and it will not only teach them to prevent themselves from being bullied, it will prevent them from becoming bullied.
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:06.000 Yeah, because they'll recognize what it's like and what the power of physical intimidation is.
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000 Yeah, and they will not like it. Yeah, and I would say it would help them not become a bully because a lot of stuff that goes on at home.
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:22.000 And everyone's different, everyone's family's different, but a lot of times bullies, people, people kids that become bullies, they're bullied at home.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000 So being a bully is just a result of something else, you know.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:34.000 So yeah, because it helps your confidence and your security as a kid, so you will feel less insecure if you're an insecure kid.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000 So that alone is really powerful even if you are prone to becoming a bully.
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:50.000 This is kind of, this is kind of well known. I think it's pretty well known that usually when you're bullied, like when someone's bullying someone else, even adults, it's not necessarily about beating them up and picking on them beating them up.
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.000 It's less about the physical part of it and more about just the mental power.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000 Oh, it's so it's the power to.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:05.000 So when you learn GJ2 and man, I'm telling you, I wasn't really bullied or nothing like that, but when you start to know GJ2, you have it in your head.
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:12.000 It's almost like you can't help but just radiate that kind of secure confidence.
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:21.000 So if you're like, if you're rolling and you know GJ2 now and a bully tries to bully you, he will gather immediately in this program's like specific programs.
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:30.000 Having to do a GJ2 called bully proof and all these dumb and just generally speaking, you learn this in GJ2, where you just basically you just stand in your ground.
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:36.000 And you basically, you can, there's all these different ways to do it, but you call out the bully like, are you, are you trying to fight me right now?
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000 And just standing up to them will usually stop the bullying.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000 Because if they bully you and you're like, oh, yeah.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000 And I'll tell you this.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.000 Even though a majority of the bullying is verbal or mental or psychological, it's all on the premise.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000 All the bullying is built on the premise most to the time that I can physically beat you up.
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000 So therefore you can't do anything. Yeah. Occasionally you'll get some young,
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000 kids scrappy little loudmouth kid that just bullies people just on the fact that they just don't care.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000 Right. Right. That's a rare, that's a rare breed.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.000 Most bullies, they feel like they can physically win and therefore they can mentally abuse people.
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:23.000 And once that, once the victim realizes, you know what, I can actually take this person out, the whole dynamic changes.
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000 Yeah. Yeah. And just that that first stage of standing up to them, just even verbally.
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000 That's in the bullies mind. That's a little indicator.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000 I can't really, this guy.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000 But some bullies, they might be like, hey, I've sized advantage.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000 This guy's just feeling a little triumphant today.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000 And he's going to try to stand up to me and then they'll push it.
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000 And then when you know that you just, you know, it man, you can deal with bullies really easy as a kid.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000 So you can take down Mount, you know, slap to the faces man, make it joke.
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:59.000 I wish I knew it when I was a little kid. It teaches you perfectly where to be and where not to be.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000 Were you just controlled the fight?
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:01.000 Okay.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000 Be big and man. Oh, I wish I said when I wish he was around on audio.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000 Exquestion.
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.000 How do I deal with being in an environment?
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000 I'm forced to be in.
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000 I mean, I'm 18, 18 years old.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000 And I have one year school left.
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000 High school is just a place I perish in.
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000 It kills creativity.
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000 All of the information taught is easily obtainable on the internet.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000 I don't feel like I have any purpose in school.
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Learning things that I would be of, that will be little of little to no use in my life for eight hours a day.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000 Just seems dumb in having aspergers and ADHD doesn't make sitting in a math class for 90 minutes easier.
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:59.000 Also, most people are not about achievement, motivation or anything, but would rather play it safe and stay in our small town all their life.
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000 Would love to hear your thoughts on a forced environment.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:11.000 Well, I will tell you that the thoughts contained in that paragraph probably encapsulated
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:18.000 a large, large number of humans in high school.
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000 Myself being included in that group, myself and my buddies, when we were growing up, we didn't want to be in high school.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.000 We wanted to get out, we wanted to get after it, we wanted to do whether we want to see the world, we wanted to make things happen, right?
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000 Not necessarily good things either, but just things.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000 We just wanted to make stuff happen.
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000 When I hear this, it's kind of very normal.
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.000 First of all, I do that, K-Man, you're just feeling what normal people feel.
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:54.000 Not everybody, because some people really enjoy high school, they enjoy education, not a large number, but some people recognize that it's an opportunity.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:05.000 High school is an opportunity, and it's an opportunity to learn, and it's an opportunity to hang out and meet people and kind of live that part of your life.
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000 I mean, it is one of the most relaxing things.
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000 It's one of the most relaxing phases of life, right?
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:17.000 You just have nothing, you know, pressure, and I say no pressure.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.000 And when you're in high school, you're like, well, no, I had to take a test.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Yeah, homework, exactly.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000 This is another thing that I always think about with forced environments.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:38.000 When I was a kid, I worked construction, and some of the guys I worked construction with were pretty rough characters and one of them had done a fair amount of time in prison.
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000 And one of the things that he said to me was, you know, when you're in prison.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:55.000 If you stand right next to the bars in yourself, if you stand right next to them, then you're locked in there.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:07.000 But if you walk back away from the bars, and you see what kind of freedom you got inside that cell, even though it's small, it's bigger than when you stand right next to the bars.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000 Yeah.
01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:17.000 So I always had this feeling of, you know, just step back from the bars a little bit, and I've actually explained that to some of the buddies of mine when they would feel trapped in the Navy.
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:22.000 You know, because even the SEAL teams, I love that you know, but guys would sometimes start feeling trapped in the Navy.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000 And I'd say, I'd say, we know what? If you want to get out, get out.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:33.000 Give yourself an out if you want to, but just then assess it from a position where you say, you know what, I could get out if I wanted to.
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000 So don't stand so close to the bars, I come stuck in the Navy.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:36.000 Yeah.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000 Step back and go, you know what if I want to get out and look at it and they go, you know what?
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000 Actually, it's not a bad deal.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000 It's a pretty good deal.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000 And that's what I would do in a situation like this.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.000 You look at going high school. I mean, yeah, you're trapped in school for eight hours a day, but eight hours a day in school.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.000 Plus eight hours a day of sleep if you sleep that much.
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000 That leaves you eight hours a day of doing whatever you want, right?
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000 And that's awesome. Plus you got weekends thrown in there.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000 Yeah.
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:10.000 So you got a lot of opportunity to do all kinds of things.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:18.000 Go on a high school for eight hours a day is a small price to pay for the opportunities that you have while you're in high school.
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.000 So it's, I don't view it really as a, as a forced environment.
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.000 I view it as an opportunity.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000 I mean, do they got a gym there? What, you know, you're going to learn something.
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000 Hmm.
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:34.000 Even if it's stuff that you could learn on the internet, why not have a human teacher to you?
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000 That's pretty cool.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000 You know, sit in that class and learn what you can get if you've got ADHD and as burgers.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000 Okay. Let's see how our discipline can get control over that.
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000 And we challenge ourselves to work on the patients and work on paying attention.
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000 Paying attention is to skill. I learned that when I was college.
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.000 It's a skill.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000 It's a skill to be able to sit down and read something that you do not want to read.
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000 It's a skill.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000 It's a skill to be able to sit into a class and listen to a lecture on a subject that you do not want to listen to.
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000 That takes, I just got a cool Twitter that next time I'll try and remember to read it.
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000 But it's a guy that was like, hey, I hated school.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000 And I'm going through this class right now. And I got to write these responses to these,
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000 to these reading assignments that we've got.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000 It was really bothering me.
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.000 And he said, I was in the podcast and you're fired up about linguistics and fired up.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000 And so I said, you know what, I'm going to own this.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000 And now he's totally fired up to tear those, tear those reading assignments apart and dig into and find out what
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000 the words mean and he's killing it now.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000 No, I'm in the same boat, but I don't check.
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000 That's outstanding.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000 So again, you're not trapped unless you stand right next to those bars that run front of your face.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000 Step back away from the bars, look around and see what kind of freedom you actually have.
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000 And you've got a lot of freedom.
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000 May not feel like it.
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000 But you've got a lot of freedom.
01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000 You've got a lot of things to take advantage of from time to equipment to education,
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000 take advantage of all that stuff.
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000 You've got another year left.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:05.000 Kill it.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000 Make it happen.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000 And that's my advice to the senior in high school.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000 You mentioned reading or paying attention is a skill.
01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.000 You mentioned reading stuff that you don't want to read.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000 And remember how I said, a few times back where that's not that.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.000 That's a common thing people who just I don't want to read.
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000 I don't want to read a book.
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000 That's not like that's pretty common.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000 A lot of people would prefer not to read.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000 It looks or whatever.
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000 But if you're willing to read or you like to read,
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000 I would even go beyond it.
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000 Almost call that a superpower.
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000 Not like a superpower like it's super human or anything.
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000 But that's like an end of a major advantage.
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:55.000 And I mentioned this where all the information you ever want to know is out there.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000 And you can access it.
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000 If you know how to read, you can access it.
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000 But here's the thing.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000 Like, well, then everyone kind of knows that.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000 And one way or another people, especially here in the US,
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.000 you kind of know that.
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.000 Information is over.
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000 All the information.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000 Whether you understand or not, there's a different thing.
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000 This information can help you in probably 90 to 99% of anything you want to do.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000 It can help you become that.
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000 All this information.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000 All you need is this information, then you just act on and do it.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000 Right.
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:34.000 Then why isn't everyone just successful in everything they want to do?
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000 And every single way you can learn all the information you can learn all the skills by reading about it.
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000 All of it right now.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000 Lack of discipline.
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000 Because they don't want to read it.
01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:48.000 Who wants to go to the library or get a book in read a 2000 page book on economics.
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:51.000 Even though if they were just to read that read it three times,
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000 they would know exactly what to do, what to invest in, where is this trick?
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.000 You'd know a lot.
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000 You'd have some powerful information to become,
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000 I don't know, rich or just make more money or whatever.
01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000 So the reason that people don't want to read, that's it.
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000 Meanwhile, and we talked about this before.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000 Meanwhile, you have time, you have time to read.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000 If you have time to watch TV, you have time to read.
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000 If you have time to, I don't know, go to the beach or,
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000 I don't know, whatever you do in your spare time.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000 You have time to read going to the beach won't help you in ways that reading can help you.
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000 And watching reality TV can't help you as much as reading can help you.
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000 But it's one of the things that it's viewed as such a chore.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000 I think for a lot of people.
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000 Yeah, it's readers of chore instead of being viewed as an opportunity.
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.000 Yeah.
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.000 And I think the reading, like, if someone could just inject all the information into your brain,
01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000 then people would do it, you know.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:51.000 But it's that reading, that's the chore that's what they don't want to do.
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000 So consider that.
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:53.000 Right?
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000 He mentioned that all the information is available on the internet.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.000 Right?
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.000 But in school, you have a teacher who knows this information.
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000 You can ask questions about it.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000 I read stuff and I'm like, I don't really get what he means right there.
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.000 I'll read again.
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000 I don't really get what he, or he'd get.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000 I still don't get what it means by this.
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000 But at school, he just raised your hand.
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000 That's the question.
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000 Who explained it?
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:17.000 You don't want to start a raise your hand again.
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000 You can raise your hand out after everything the teacher says.
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.000 You can raise your hand.
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000 Tell him to explain it again.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000 He's right there.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000 Every class.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000 There's your opportunity right there.
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000 In the answer.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000 Next one.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000 Echo fired up for the reading.
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000 I like that.
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000 I'm telling you, man.
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000 It's like one day's the light, the light's on.
01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000 It's kind of new, right?
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000 It's new, yes.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000 This is post-jocopilot.
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000 This is post-jocopilot.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000 And now you're just absorbing information.
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.000 Right?
01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000 And it's not this thing where I started to start to get into reading.
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000 It's like when you walk into them, the lights are off.
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000 It's like, oh, there's nothing really in this room.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000 I don't see anything in this room.
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000 You turn the light, you're like, oh my gosh.
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000 The all this was here this whole time.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000 I'm over here at this age.
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000 I could have been doing this the whole time.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000 This reading? You know where I've heard of.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000 I started doing this.
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000 Oh, my gosh.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000 This guy's 18 denying it.
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000 Keep in the light off.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 Don't do that.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 Don't do that.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.000 You don't have to do that.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000 Just, oh, he can have just turned it on.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000 Turn it on.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000 That's what you're going to do.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000 Good advice.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:25.000 Jockel, does leadership require the atrics or acting skill in the case of an underperforming
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000 subordinate?
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000 I mean, obviously in a way, yes, it does.
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000 But it's definitely more complicated than that as well.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000 Because, and we've talked about this before.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000 You know, I've talked about like, when if you want to make an impression of your kids,
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000 they haven't listened to you and you've told them 14 times.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000 And finally, you know, you've been all calm and detached.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000 I'm just like, okay, this is it.
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000 This is why you give it everything you're supposed to do in the extreme ownership,
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000 handbook of leadership and they're still not listening to you.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000 And you go, you know what?
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000 I've got to show some, some anger here.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000 Right.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000 So they realize that I'm really serious.
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000 So that's the time when you might have to flip the switch and act.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000 Right.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.000 Like your angry, for instance.
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:16.000 And, you know, this is part of detachment.
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000 Because if you are controlling your emotions and you decide you need to show some emotions,
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.000 then you're going to need to do some sort of, I guess it would be considered acting.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000 The atrics, some theatrics to, to make that clear.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000 Now, and also, Michael, in the other direction where you don't want to show that you're frustrated,
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000 or you don't want to show that you're angry, or you don't want to show, you know,
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000 if you're, if you've got your team looking at you and you, and you're, you don't want to show that you're frustrated.
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000 It's a philosophy that you're getting.
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000 Yeah, so you got to act, okay, you know what?
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000 I'm just, you know, I've got to act cool.
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000 I've got to detach a little bit and just act cool.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:41:00.000 And so that those are both, I guess those could be considered acting.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000 But at the same time, I don't think it's disingenuous.
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000 And I will tell you why.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000 The reason I'll tell you why is because remember when I was on Sam Harris,
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000 and we were talking about being brave, then he, I think it was he, he said,
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.000 if you pretend to be brave, well, then you are in fact being brave.
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:26.000 So if, if you're wounded in the street, and there's machine gun fire going on,
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000 and I say, you know what, I don't want to do this, but I'm just going to pretend to be brave right now.
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000 And I run out and grab you pull the other street.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000 Even though I was pretending to be brave, I was brave, because that's what I did.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000 I did the action.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000 It's the same thing here.
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.000 If I'm really angry at you, but I decide, you know what, I got to keep that inside.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000 And I've got to act like I'm calm.
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000 Well, guess what?
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000 What I did was act calm.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000 So therefore, it's not acting that's what I did as a person.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000 So I guess I'm really not acting at all because I'm being me and me is detached.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000 And acting like I'm calm even though I'm super angry.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000 Yeah.
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000 You are a kind of a weird paradox.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000 Yeah, you technically, and I thought about this before.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000 You are acting, but just like how you're saying, it's not disingenuous,
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000 because there's a difference between what you feel and how you behave.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000 Like feelings and behavior.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:24.000 So if I'm mad at you for something, and I don't yell at you and be all,
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000 does that mean I'm not mad at you?
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000 It doesn't mean that.
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:29.000 Right.
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:37.000 But what if I am mad at you and I do, my madness, my anger makes me yell at you.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000 All that means is my feelings are driving my behavior, just because your feelings aren't driving your behavior.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000 It doesn't mean it's disingenuous.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000 You know, so you can still be mad.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:53.000 You can still yell even though the yelling isn't because you're mad.
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.000 The yelling is for a specific result.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000 So just like how you're saying, you're still acting.
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000 Yes, you're acting.
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:03.000 You're acting, but you're acting because you want a certain result.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000 Yes, that's why I say you are acting.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000 Because if you're not acting, that means that your anger is driving your behavior.
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000 Your feeling is driving your behavior.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000 Otherwise, you're just, yeah, you're acting.
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000 But I think I agree with you when we're talking about it before it.
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000 That's a good thing.
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000 You're going for results here.
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:20.000 Yeah.
01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000 And that's the question.
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000 The actual question is, it specifically says underperforming subordinate.
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:35.000 And so clearly, yeah, you might have to show some anger so that they realize that you're really serious, that they may get fired, that they need to improve, that they need to, whatever the case may be.
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000 Yeah.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000 And yeah, if it's with your girlfriend and wife, it shows me you care.
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000 A lot of times, you know, how like you'll be like, hey, you know, say something in your saying it at all, call me whatever.
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:51.000 And caring, knowing you care about the or some, someone knowing that you care about them, that is a big deal.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000 Versus if they suspect that, why he doesn't care about the situation.
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000 Okay.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000 Yeah.
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000 No, you're right.
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000 She'll say you care about you care.
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000 People want you to care.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000 Jocquie, you got to care.
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000 Next question.
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:19.000 At what point does loyalty and what could become martyrdom for a human that you care about, become outweated with the desire to improve oneself?
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000 Put differently.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:28.000 Loyal to be there for loyal to be there for a loved one, teammate, employee, et cetera.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000 In a tough situation or downward spiral, is an important and admirable trait.
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:40.000 But when does it go too far that one should become selfish and begin to cut those ties?
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000 This is a question that everybody's got to deal with at some point in their life.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:51.000 Obviously, I'm all about helping people and doing everything you can to help people out, right?
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000 That's great.
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000 Sure.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000 But you got to take care of yourself first.
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:03.000 And I think I think the thing that I think of is when you go on an airplane and they say, hey, if we lose pressure in the cabin, the oxygen mask and drop down.
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.000 And if you're with a child, take care of yourself first, then you can take your child.
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000 So what happens if you don't take care of yourself first, then you pass out and now your child doesn't can help.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.000 And then now you both die from lack of oxygen.
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000 So that's sort of like life, right?
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000 If you've got somebody that's dragged and that's going down and downward spiral.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000 And you decide that you're just going to pour everything into them.
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000 Well, then you're going to go down that downward spiral as well.
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000 And now you're not going to be able to help them.
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.000 So I think you definitely have to get yourself.
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000 You have to take care of yourself as a person.
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:45.000 So that you have the platform to take care of someone else and help someone move in the right direction.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000 And so I don't think you can let yourself get dragged down too far.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:59.000 Down these paths, you have to get the oxygen mask on yourself and stabilize yourself and have a platform to help other people without getting dragged down.
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000 And I'll tell you something else.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000 By the way, oftentimes when you think you're helping someone.
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000 You're really just enabling them.
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.000 Then you see that with addictive, you know, when people are in a case of addiction, it's awful.
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:20.000 And the people that are trying to love ones that are trying to help them by saying, okay, look, I'm going to help you through them.
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000 I'm going to give you a little bit more money right now, but this is the last time.
01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000 And then the next week itself, give you a little bit more money.
01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:30.000 And all they're doing is buying booze or drugs or whatever addiction that they have.
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000 And it's horrible to see.
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.000 And you are actually even though you think you're helping them, you're actually hurting them.
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:43.000 And so I think, I guess it's a big night for a detachment on the podcast here, but you got to detach.
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000 You got to make sure you're not becoming emotional.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000 You got to make sure that you're seeing the person and the situation for what it really is.
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000 Not what you want it to be.
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:57.000 But what it really is, who they really are, what they are really doing.
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:08.000 And then when you're detached, you got to make logical decisions from that point of detachment to decide whether this person can be helped.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:14.000 And how far you're willing to go to help them.
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000 And you got to remember, you can't be a hero to everybody.
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000 And you can't help everybody all the time.
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000 And again, I want to help people out when they're in trouble.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:32.000 But you need to maintain your own stability in life.
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000 So that you have a platform that you can help people.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000 Because if you burn down your platform and you throw away your stability,
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000 not only will you not be able to help that person, you won't be able to help anybody including yourself eventually.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:45.000 Yeah.
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:52.000 And you say, like, you want to help them without letting them drag you down too far.
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000 So that point, that too far point is going to be different for everybody and every relationship.
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000 So I think you can kind of get a handle on that.
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000 Like, what is too far?
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000 What is being dragged down too far?
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000 Is it getting in the way of these important things in my life?
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.000 You know?
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000 Because he's talking about when do you cut those ties?
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000 That means you've been dragged down too far where you've got to cut those ties.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000 So I think that's important.
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000 Some people, they're just, that's kind of their thing.
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000 You know, they'll get dragged all the way down.
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000 Some people I think they might want to try to help people.
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000 Yes, exactly.
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000 Which can be fine.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000 I think that that's people's kind of thing.
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000 I think, you know, there's all kinds of different people.
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000 And I think that that's fine.
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:37.000 Yeah.
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:42.000 Because I think it drags both parties into the darkness.
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000 Yeah.
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.000 If they go all the way down, like, you know, they lose some important stuff in their life.
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000 But a job, fine answers.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000 Yeah.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000 Stability.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000 But some people, they, you know, it's like that's kind of their, I don't want to say they're
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000 Lot in life because it sounds kind of like it's a bad thing.
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.000 It's their addiction.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000 Yeah, it's like their thing.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.000 They like it.
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000 So there's that.
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000 So helping versus enabling, right?
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000 So there's two kinds of like,
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.000 Correction.
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000 And I might get the terms wrong.
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.000 But it's direct help in systemic help.
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000 So direct help is like the superficial obvious help.
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.000 Like take the, take the consideration of, like, giving money to a homeless person.
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:23.000 Right?
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000 Where if someone has a cup and is like, you know, help me, you know, give me money basically.
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000 I put five bucks in the help in the cup.
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000 Right.
01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.000 So that's, that's direct versus systemic systemic would be, okay, I'm going to contribute to a
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000 Super Kitchen.
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:43.000 Yeah, or no more.
01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000 No, no, no, even go more systemic than that.
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000 So I'm going to contribute to a program that gets people on their feet,
01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.000 Basically giving people the tools to help themselves, right?
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000 So that's systemic.
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000 That goes, that doesn't solve the superficial problem.
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000 It's like, it's like, instead of watering the leaves, you water the roots.
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000 It's that.
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000 So instead of giving money to a homeless person, which can potentially.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000 You worse.
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000 Yes, because just like what enabling is, look, if I'm a homeless guy, I'm like, hey,
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000 look, whatever, whatever my situation, I'm a homeless guy, I'm asking for money.
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:20.000 I make 50 bucks today at this corner.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000 I'm going to come back tomorrow and make my 50 bucks.
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000 I have no other skills.
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:29.000 If you want to help them, if you would if someone came,
01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000 and instead of 50 bucks or five bucks or dollar, whatever, they gave me some skills.
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000 However, they didn't, I don't know, a magical pill, and they gave me some skills.
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000 I don't know, I knew how to sell real estate or something.
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000 I don't know.
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000 I'd go use those skills and boom, then I'm helped.
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:52.000 You know, so yeah, the helping versus enabling, I think you got to put it into perspective
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000 and give it a lot of thought when you help someone.
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000 And I think the people who enable people or who accidentally enable people,
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.000 all that is them not putting enough thought into it, how to help them.
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000 Because a lot of times I really care.
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000 But they end up enabling them.
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000 And on top of it, which makes it more of a challenge for people enabling the people they care about,
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:21.000 is they get a payoff from giving them whatever it is they give them more or lying for them or doing this other stuff.
01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000 It's like I helped them for that day, so it gives them that payoff a little feel good.
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000 Yeah, helped them that day.
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000 I gave the home, oh man, he's so nice. He gave that homeless guy, five bucks.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000 Oh, dang everyone's giving change. He's over here giving them five bucks.
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:44.000 When really, I'm not saying all the time, I'm not saying all the time, but potentially you could have basically just made that corner more valuable for them to work.
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.000 Potentially.
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000 Say it all the time.
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:54.000 So like I think something that would help is put in the thought with how you want to help.
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000 So if you can help systemically, that's the way to help.
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000 Better. So better way to help. In my opinion.
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000 All right, next question.
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:13.000 Jocco, how do you get over feeling like an imposter as a new manager?
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000 I feel like I'm about to get found out.
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000 Welcome to the leadership, my friend.
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.000 Here's the thing. Here's what you're actually scared of.
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:28.000 What you're scared of most likely is them knowing and finding out that you don't know everything.
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:29.000 You don't know everything.
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.000 Right.
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000 That's what people don't like to admit when they're wrong.
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000 Yes.
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000 And the thing that you need to know is it's okay.
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000 It's okay not to know everything.
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000 It's perfectly normal to be in a leadership position and not know everything in the world.
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.000 You don't have to know everything about this particular job that you're going into or what you don't need to know everything.
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000 You don't need to.
01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000 What you need to do is go in.
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000 Ask questions, listen to people.
01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000 And say, hey, no, I haven't done this procedure before.
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000 I've never, I never worked with this piece of equipment before.
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000 Can you show me how to do it?
01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000 I just want to make sure I understand what you're doing.
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000 Make sure I get it.
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000 Oh, okay.
01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000 Now, it's not an excuse to not know anything because if you're in a leadership position,
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:21.000 you should be studying and reading and learning about whatever the role you're in
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000 so that you can understand it all.
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000 Study the manuals and the regulations and the procedures.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.000 And I'm not saying to follow all those things blindly without common sense.
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000 No, that's not what I'm saying.
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000 But there's a knowledge base that you should you should acquire very quickly when you roll into a leadership position.
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.000 So put the work in and then apply common sense.
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:49.000 But this is the same thing that I say every time somebody asked me about how do you lead this or how do you lead that or how do you lead new people or how do you lead senior people.
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000 It's the same answer every time.
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000 You don't need to know every thing.
01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:54.000 Listen to them.
01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000 Be on time.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000 Work hard.
01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000 Treat people with respect.
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000 Way the decisions carefully.
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000 Talk to people and then make a good decision.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000 Empower your folks.
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.000 To lead.
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000 Don't micromanage them.
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000 But give them at the same time clear guidance about what the expectations are.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000 It's just leadership.
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:20.000 And when you're a new leader, it's all good.
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000 You don't need to know everything.
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000 You're not expected know everything and showing that you could admit that you don't know everything.
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000 Isn't going to hurt your reputation.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000 It's actually going to help you reputation.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000 So go in.
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000 Be humble.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000 Ask some good questions.
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000 Learn as fast as you can.
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000 And it's okay.
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.000 And you know, I was thinking about this.
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000 In the 80s and perhaps even in the 90s.
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:53.000 When guys were losing their hair and going bald right, they do a comb over.
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000 So they try and pull their hair over their balding scalp.
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000 So it didn't look like they were going bald.
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:02.000 And I'm telling you as a leader.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000 Don't do a leadership comb over.
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000 Do what guys do now.
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000 Which is they just shave their head right.
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000 Hey, get you know what?
01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000 I'm going a little thin up top.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000 All good.
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000 Just going to shave it off.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000 Hey, I'm your new leader.
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000 Don't know everything.
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000 It's all good.
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000 Here's where I, here's where I'm weak.
01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000 Give me a hand.
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000 Yeah.
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000 No big deal.
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000 That's a good analogy by the way.
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000 Don't do leadership over.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000 Come over.
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000 Um, what, tell me if you would agree with this.
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000 It generally speaking.
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000 You're watching movie demolition, man, with the, the slow and lessy snipes.
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000 Negative.
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000 Anyway, Dennis, I think this name is Dennis Leary.
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000 Yeah, that doesn't seem like you're kind of movie.
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000 But maybe it would be, I don't know.
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000 I'm not sure, I'm not sure.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000 I'm not sure.
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000 It's a long explanation.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000 I'm going to make it sure.
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000 It doesn't do leadership though for now.
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000 Okay.
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000 I'm ready.
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000 So small by leadership.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000 Basically, that, you know, it's in the future, whatever.
01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000 And the world is turning into this, like oversensitized.
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000 Like you can't swear.
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000 You can't eat junk food.
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000 It's the law.
01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000 Like, you know, so everyone's all nice and real weak and stuff like that.
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.52 But there's a group of people who rebelled against it went underground, right?
01:56:13.52 --> 01:56:16.96 And the leader of those guys is called Edgar Friendly, right?
01:56:16.96 --> 01:56:19.92 And so they go down and he's regarded as this huge criminal, right?
01:56:19.92 --> 01:56:25.92 So demolishing comes back, long story about him, but anyway, he's back to help rid the world of these criminals.
01:56:26.88 --> 01:56:29.44 So he goes and he encounters Edgar Friendly and they're not,
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.52 they're not these evil people. They're just like just trying to live basically a freedom, a free life, you know?
01:56:35.52 --> 01:56:40.48 And they're like, oh, he's like, hey, well, why don't you lead these people out of here, right?
01:56:41.20 --> 01:56:42.48 And he's like, I'm no leader.
01:56:43.52 --> 01:56:46.80 Sometimes I do some shit and people come with me.
01:56:47.52 --> 01:56:48.64 Right? That's kind of what he says.
01:56:49.52 --> 01:56:53.92 So isn't this, so here's the question. Sorry for long explanation.
01:56:58.08 --> 01:57:04.16 How this guy's he's kind of like worried about people finding him out that he's not a leader, right?
01:57:04.16 --> 01:57:08.40 Isn't that like a huge sign of humility that he's like on the inside? He's not,
01:57:08.40 --> 01:57:12.48 Yeah, I know everything, you know, it's kind of like, I don't know at all, you know?
01:57:12.48 --> 01:57:13.68 And I'm worried about this.
01:57:13.68 --> 01:57:17.60 It's actually a good sign. You are correct. It's a good sign when you got someone's like, man, I want to do
01:57:17.60 --> 01:57:20.40 he wants to do a good job. He wants to respect his leader, he wants to do a good job.
01:57:20.40 --> 01:57:23.44 And he's like, worried about it. So that is a good, that is a good thing.
01:57:23.44 --> 01:57:30.08 Yeah, it's like his humility is like, it's so genuine that that's one of his many worries of being a leader, you know?
01:57:30.08 --> 01:57:35.44 That's a good sign. It's better than someone says, you know what? I'm about to take over as a new leader.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:42.24 Yeah, I'm on this thing. I'm going to own this thing. I know everything and no one knows anything that I know.
01:57:42.24 --> 01:57:44.80 So it's going to, right? Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.
01:57:46.80 --> 01:57:52.72 This next one is sort of a statement and sort of a question wrapped in there.
01:57:52.72 --> 01:57:58.32 Somebody coming from law enforcement. I thought it was a pretty informative statement,
01:57:58.32 --> 01:58:04.32 based on one of the other podcasts that we did. And it says this, I currently work of vice,
01:58:05.12 --> 01:58:11.60 but I've had my share of use of force on the job. I quickly learned that you can't knock everyone out
01:58:11.60 --> 01:58:16.96 and that applying jujitsu will reduce injuries to you and the suspects. So this is what we talked about
01:58:16.96 --> 01:58:23.12 last time. Whereas if I, if my method of controlling you is to strike you, I'm going to have to beat you
01:58:23.12 --> 01:58:30.32 over and over again to get you to submit. Whereas if I know how to do a chokehold, boom, you're good.
01:58:30.88 --> 01:58:38.000 Back to the quote, the chokehold or corroded as we call it, is still permitted in our force policy,
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:44.40 but only in an immediate defense of life situation, basically using a chokehold is considered
01:58:44.40 --> 01:58:52.56 deadly force and equivalent with shooting someone. There was a time when the LAPD saying was
01:58:52.56 --> 01:58:59.20 a wind and out choke him out. In the 80s during the PCP era, officers were applying the
01:58:59.20 --> 01:59:07.20 karate choke on PCP suspects daily. During one of those incidents, a male black died from the
01:59:07.20 --> 01:59:14.24 choke being improperly applied. Chief gates made the mistake of going on national television
01:59:14.24 --> 01:59:19.44 and saying that male blacks had a higher chance of dying from the choke due to their physical
01:59:19.44 --> 01:59:28.08 make and larger atoms apple. As you can imagine, this caused an outrage which in turn caused the
01:59:28.08 --> 01:59:33.52 department to fall to political pressure and make the karate choke almost impossible to use.
01:59:36.56 --> 01:59:43.28 So when I kind of alluded to this on that last podcast, that there's, there's exactly what happened.
01:59:43.28 --> 01:59:48.64 A guy got choked to death. There was political pressure. Chief gates comes out and says that
01:59:50.24 --> 01:59:55.68 actually I went, I went online and researched this a little bit. He made like every classic mistake
01:59:55.68 --> 02:00:06.64 you could make on this and that's why they outlawed using chokeholds. And actually, as I read
02:00:06.64 --> 02:00:11.44 through it, they abunch from kind of how I referred to the Ronny King beating and said,
02:00:11.44 --> 02:00:19.52 here you had guys just wailing on this individual with bats and sticks and Billy clubs or whatever
02:00:20.56 --> 02:00:26.64 and it didn't stop him and they refer to that that when they looked at the chokehold being used.
02:00:26.64 --> 02:00:31.52 That's one of the major cases that they same hand. Let us let people use the chokehold so this does
02:00:31.52 --> 02:00:38.40 happen. This guy goes on as a certified Rcon which is our consents for arrest and control,
02:00:38.40 --> 02:00:43.92 Rcon and structure. I feel the department taking away our ability to use a rear naked choke
02:00:43.92 --> 02:00:52.000 is caused many unnecessary shootings and injuries to suspects. It saddens me to work for a department
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.68 that is being run like a poor corporation instead of a police department. So that's kind of the
02:00:57.68 --> 02:01:02.000 buildup, right? And that's why I wanted to read it because there was just good information in there.
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:12.48 It is very much in line with what we talked about last time in police work and also in combat situations
02:01:12.48 --> 02:01:16.56 where you're dealing with non-combat of people in a hostile environment. In other words,
02:01:16.56 --> 02:01:20.64 you go into a building to capture a terrorist and there's a women in their or there's kids in
02:01:20.64 --> 02:01:25.84 their or there's teenagers in their that are not combative but they're not compliant either.
02:01:25.84 --> 02:01:29.12 So they don't have a gun, you're not going to shoot them but you got to get control of them.
02:01:29.12 --> 02:01:38.56 Now it gets into the sort of the leadership question here. How do I keep morale up and stay motivated
02:01:38.56 --> 02:01:44.16 when I have no faith in the leaders and when the leadership has turned its back on you time after
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:52.32 time? The morale is at its lowest point even lower than post 92 riots according to the old
02:01:52.32 --> 02:02:00.24 timers. We were trained in the academy to be warriors. Now the department doesn't allow us to call
02:02:00.24 --> 02:02:08.48 ourselves warriors only guardians. This change in mentality will sadly cause only more bad shootings
02:02:08.48 --> 02:02:19.68 and more officers getting hurt. So that's obviously tough situation. And like I said for the
02:02:19.68 --> 02:02:24.80 jujitsu versus striking, I think this is spot on the jujitsu and the grappling is as far superior
02:02:24.80 --> 02:02:31.04 way, like I said of controlling people than striking is. That's just a reality. Now on the leadership
02:02:31.04 --> 02:02:47.36 front, that leadership question. For me, I have my own team. I got my people. The people that
02:02:47.36 --> 02:02:53.52 around me, I'm going to buffer all this bad morale and all this stuff. I'm going to buffer it
02:02:53.52 --> 02:02:59.12 away from my team. I'm going to make their lives good. That's my goal. And I'm going to lead
02:02:59.12 --> 02:03:06.56 toward what my ideal is. I'm going to lead toward what my ideal is. Now in order to do that, well,
02:03:06.56 --> 02:03:12.88 you got to play the game so that you can get more influence. If you don't go play the game,
02:03:12.88 --> 02:03:18.48 you say, hey, the bosses don't know what they're talking about. Bosses don't know what they're talking
02:03:18.48 --> 02:03:35.04 about. And we need to, you got to play the game so that you can get more influence. And that means
02:03:35.60 --> 02:03:40.08 doing what you have to do. That means not saying, hey, our morale sucks and we don't have
02:03:40.08 --> 02:03:44.56 good leadership. No, it means going, okay, we're going to move. We're going to move forward. Here's
02:03:44.56 --> 02:03:48.72 the goal. Here's what I think. Here's what I believe. Hey, by the way, I'm going to run this up the
02:03:48.72 --> 02:03:54.32 chain of command. I'm going to gather the data myself. I'm going to do the research. I'm going to
02:03:54.32 --> 02:03:58.40 do the administrative work. I'm going to study the cases. I'm going to present them and say, hey,
02:03:58.40 --> 02:04:04.08 here's what's happening. I don't know. I'm going to do that from an unemotional situation. Just from
02:04:04.08 --> 02:04:08.32 pure logic, hey, we've had this many shootings. We've had this many incidents. We've had this many,
02:04:08.32 --> 02:04:18.40 we've had this many suspects turn up with, with concussions. There's only one thing that causes
02:04:18.40 --> 02:04:25.28 a concussion to a suspect. It's getting hit in the head. So if we're having, you know, 42% concussion
02:04:25.28 --> 02:04:29.92 rate, maybe we could drop that down if we use something that doesn't cause concussions, but still
02:04:29.92 --> 02:04:37.60 gives us control. You got to, you got to do that legwork and make life good for the people that work
02:04:37.60 --> 02:04:44.56 for you. And that's, that can be a little bit hard to do, but it's not that hard. You know,
02:04:44.56 --> 02:04:51.60 you're your subordinates. Look at you as the guy. And so the way you carry yourself and the way you
02:04:51.60 --> 02:04:55.36 present yourself and the morale that you have is the morale that they're going to have. That's what
02:04:55.36 --> 02:05:00.64 they're going to see as the way it is. And I've always viewed in a single team that with the
02:05:00.64 --> 02:05:07.20 SEAL teams to have different vibes in them. Good and bad. Someone have good commands. And there's a,
02:05:07.20 --> 02:05:11.60 there's a new commanding officer every two years of the SEAL team. So you get a new guy that comes in
02:05:11.60 --> 02:05:16.32 and he might be a lot different than the last guy. He might be really good. He might be really bad.
02:05:17.20 --> 02:05:20.88 And you know what, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter to me in the SEAL Poutine as a
02:05:20.88 --> 02:05:26.48 platoon commander or even as a squad commander or even as an E5 in the SEAL Poutine. Meaning
02:05:26.48 --> 02:05:31.36 just one of the sled dogs. I don't care what the upper chain of command because guess what,
02:05:31.36 --> 02:05:35.84 we're going to do things right. We're going to make things happen. Now we're not going to disobey
02:05:35.84 --> 02:05:39.04 what's being told, but if we're being told something that's wrong, guess what, we're going to try
02:05:39.04 --> 02:05:41.68 to get it. We're going to run up the chain of command. We're going to be squared away. We're going to
02:05:41.68 --> 02:05:46.88 play the games so that we can make the changes that need to be made because I care about the teams.
02:05:47.92 --> 02:05:52.32 Just like this guy cares about the police department wants it to be a great force.
02:05:52.32 --> 02:06:02.08 He wants it to do the right thing. And so you got to take that attitude that you control your
02:06:02.08 --> 02:06:07.84 part of the world. And the more you improve your part of the world and the more influence you gain,
02:06:07.84 --> 02:06:15.20 the more you'll have control over the big picture as well. There's no company, no corporation that
02:06:15.20 --> 02:06:22.88 maintains just superb morale all the time. It doesn't happen. You know, every company, every business,
02:06:22.88 --> 02:06:28.32 every unit, every force, every team has ups and downs. And they have leadership that comes in and
02:06:28.32 --> 02:06:35.52 takes over and that everyone considers to be bad. And that's the way it is. But you've got to own
02:06:35.52 --> 02:06:41.20 your little piece of the world. And then as you own your piece of the world, guess what,
02:06:41.20 --> 02:06:46.24 everyone starts performing well. And as you perform well, you gain more cloud. And as you gain more
02:06:46.24 --> 02:06:52.08 cloud, you can influence real change. And that's what you're looking to do. So don't let
02:06:53.04 --> 02:07:00.16 don't let that leadership that bad, what you consider to be bad leadership. Just don't let that
02:07:00.16 --> 02:07:05.68 permeate into your head into your world, buffer your people from it. And then do what you can
02:07:05.68 --> 02:07:10.88 to build the best team you can get so that you can have more influence so that you can change
02:07:10.88 --> 02:07:16.96 that policies and the procedures that you don't agree with. It's a long haul. I know it.
02:07:16.96 --> 02:07:23.84 I don't have a miracle solution for your men. It's tough. But that's the world. That's the world.
02:07:25.12 --> 02:07:29.36 Yeah, especially when you're dealing with the political elements of it. And then at the same
02:07:29.36 --> 02:07:37.60 time, you have the public eye on you. So, you know, as far as the exposure and stuff like that,
02:07:37.60 --> 02:07:44.16 it's the newsman and just I think median general, it's easy to spread all this negative stuff.
02:07:44.16 --> 02:07:49.28 It's easy. You know, so it's like one of those jobs where it, it, you know, big way. It's um,
02:07:50.64 --> 02:07:53.84 it only gets attention when something's wrong. It's going on, you know. Yeah, and I would take
02:07:53.84 --> 02:07:57.84 advantage of a lot of this negative press. Because a lot of this negative press, like like this
02:07:57.84 --> 02:08:02.24 guy is saying, hey, we're getting more shootings, we're getting more beatings. Well, why is that?
02:08:02.24 --> 02:08:06.80 Let's look at our procedures. Hey, boss, you know what? We used to use this chokehold and we had
02:08:06.80 --> 02:08:12.88 X amount of concussions. We had X amount of shootings. You could present the information in a logical
02:08:12.88 --> 02:08:18.48 way that proves what I know to be true, what this guy knows to be true, what anybody that's ever done
02:08:18.48 --> 02:08:24.72 this type of work before knows to be true. Right. That is that there are certain techniques that
02:08:24.72 --> 02:08:30.56 work better than others and a chokehold and a grappling type scenario definitely works better
02:08:30.56 --> 02:08:36.80 to subdue somebody than striking them in the head repeatedly until they're knocked unconscious. Yeah.
02:08:36.80 --> 02:08:41.12 That's just the reality of it. And no one can argue with that. And the only reason that they went
02:08:41.12 --> 02:08:47.28 against it is for political pressure. So how do we, how do we defeat that? We gain cloud. We move.
02:08:47.28 --> 02:08:54.16 We continue to get influence. We grow our power. We strengthen our allies. We build a coalition
02:08:54.16 --> 02:09:00.80 and we go forward and we win. And it might take three years. It might take three months. It might take six
02:09:00.80 --> 02:09:05.44 years. This guy right here that wrote this might need to be the chief of police himself before
02:09:05.44 --> 02:09:11.52 he gets it done. But he that's what he does. He keeps on the right path and keeps moving the right
02:09:11.52 --> 02:09:16.000 direction and does the right thing so that he can get advanced. He doesn't make a bunch of
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:21.84 emotional arguments against people that have a bunch of power and put himself in a bad seat for them
02:09:21.84 --> 02:09:27.28 where they're looking at him like he's a rabble robzer. No, not a good thing. You got to build.
02:09:27.28 --> 02:09:30.80 You got to build the relationships up the chain of commands so that you become respected so that
02:09:30.80 --> 02:09:34.80 people do listen to you. That's what you got to do. That's how you make it happen.
02:09:36.80 --> 02:09:44.24 Yeah, man. On a side note that the chokehold, Gitu overall isn't just a mission hold. That's
02:09:44.24 --> 02:09:51.44 kind of in my opinion one of the great things about Gitu. It's like, and all it kind of seems
02:09:51.44 --> 02:09:54.88 that way sometimes if you're not, if you don't do Gitu, whatever you think, oh this guy knows
02:09:54.88 --> 02:10:00.32 Gitu. Oh, he'll choke you up. He'll break your arm. You know, the kind of the glamorous part of it
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:06.96 is the submission for sure, but the every other part of it is control controlling the situation
02:10:06.96 --> 02:10:11.60 all the way down to controlling the other guys. So when you do, when you consider like just just a
02:10:11.60 --> 02:10:18.40 concept of risk control in Gitu, when you're rolling a son, risk control, just that alone will help you
02:10:18.40 --> 02:10:23.28 in law enforcement. Just that alone. No, no, no. You don't have to let alone the whole of Gitu,
02:10:23.28 --> 02:10:28.24 just risk control. That'll help you alone. So you don't need to necessarily, and I'm not saying
02:10:28.24 --> 02:10:32.16 so the chokehold should remain ban. I'm not saying that. I mean for someone to die, I mean,
02:10:32.16 --> 02:10:36.24 I know this guy died because the chokehold was applied incorrectly. So you, I don't know if you
02:10:36.24 --> 02:10:41.36 broke his neck or his atoms up or something. Yes. And by the way, if he had, if he was better at
02:10:41.36 --> 02:10:45.76 Gitu, right, he would have applied it, put the guy to sleep and then cough them and then all
02:10:45.76 --> 02:10:49.92 but get it to go. Which happens all the time in class. By the way, in training, guys get put to sleep all the
02:10:49.92 --> 02:10:55.20 time. I can't put to sleep. I don't even know how many times. A bunch of times. For someone to die from a
02:10:55.20 --> 02:10:59.76 choke from a regular normal chokehold, you got a chokehold for a long time. Where your arms
02:10:59.76 --> 02:11:03.92 give me so tired, just from choking them after he goes unconscious. You have to keep choking them for a
02:11:03.92 --> 02:11:08.56 long time. So it takes a lot. Yeah. This is probably what you said. Probably a crush her a
02:11:08.56 --> 02:11:12.64 high-oed bone. I think it's called it's basically your Adam's apple crushes. It shuts your
02:11:12.64 --> 02:11:19.84 windpipe and the guy didn't get a tracheot man's in time. That is very, very rare. If ever in Gitu,
02:11:19.84 --> 02:11:25.92 now I've had, I've seen it happen one time, a guy passed out and went to sleep and someone was
02:11:25.92 --> 02:11:30.32 geek-yoking him. And so just kept cranking didn't realize that he was out for a couple seconds
02:11:30.32 --> 02:11:38.64 and it hurt him. So you do have to watch out for it. But I mean, that is so rare compared to the amount
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:42.32 of times that someone gets hit in the head and gets brain damage. I mean, that just happens all
02:11:42.32 --> 02:11:48.88 the time. Yeah. And this choke that you can actually do, that does that kind of stuff. But again,
02:11:48.88 --> 02:11:53.60 if you know the positions, you know the moves. You know the submissions if you can do some
02:11:53.60 --> 02:11:57.76 mission. And you're not panicking. You feel very comfortable on the ground. You feel very
02:11:57.76 --> 02:12:03.28 comfortable engaging in combat. You feel very comfortable engaging in this struggle. You're used to it.
02:12:03.28 --> 02:12:09.36 You do it all the time. So you're not freaking out. You're not adrenaline just cranking a guy in the
02:12:09.36 --> 02:12:15.28 head with a Billy Club over and over again. And what does he do? He puts his hands up. Why?
02:12:15.28 --> 02:12:18.72 Because he's trying to fight me. No, he's just trying to protect his head. But you think he's trying
02:12:18.72 --> 02:12:26.88 to fight you. And that's why you're hitting him even harder. Yeah. So yeah, it's definitely a tough
02:12:26.88 --> 02:12:35.52 situation. And the way you win on the ground is with you, too. And the way you win this leadership
02:12:35.52 --> 02:12:41.60 situation is also with you, Jitsu. You don't go in bang heads with the chain of command.
02:12:41.60 --> 02:12:45.28 Yeah. That's not how you're going to win this fight. The way you win this fight is by doing
02:12:45.28 --> 02:12:50.80 Jitsu against the leadership. And you get in with them. And you gain their trust. And you make
02:12:50.80 --> 02:12:55.92 them think that you're the man. And your team is awesome. And all by the way, I know our team's
02:12:55.92 --> 02:13:00.08 awesome. And we're totally agree with this policy. And we've supported only this policies working
02:13:00.08 --> 02:13:03.76 great in this other policy. Oh, you know what you got this one policy? That's not so good. Maybe
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:08.000 we could do something to fix that. Let me do some research. That's how you win. You got to play
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.68 the long game. It's still funny that analogy. Like, do you Jitsu, right? Because really what
02:13:13.68 --> 02:13:17.92 Jitsu is establishing a good position. Right. It's how much you're good position knowing where
02:13:17.92 --> 02:13:22.56 to be and where not to be. You know, where to put your weight or where to put your force
02:13:22.56 --> 02:13:26.72 and where not to put your force, you know? Yeah. In the other big pieces that in Jitsu
02:13:27.76 --> 02:13:31.76 that I was more referring to, although those are all correct. And you have to do those. But it's
02:13:31.76 --> 02:13:36.32 also, hey, you think I'm going to choke you, but I'm actually going to arm walk you. Right. Right.
02:13:36.32 --> 02:13:42.48 Like, that's the setup that you flank people and you attack them indirectly. Right. You infiltrate
02:13:42.48 --> 02:13:48.88 and you do things indirectly instead of going and just fist-to-cuffs bang in each other or
02:13:48.88 --> 02:13:58.16 of a tradition. Don't do that. So, you're leaving up the chain of command. I think that's kind of a
02:13:58.16 --> 02:14:05.28 new concept. Not new is. It's a chapter in the book. Yeah. Or it's actually a sub-chapter in the
02:14:05.28 --> 02:14:09.20 book. But it's one that people always have a hard time getting their head around because
02:14:10.08 --> 02:14:15.20 I always said like, my boss did whatever I want him to do. Yeah. People don't understand that.
02:14:15.20 --> 02:14:19.92 That's the way it is when you build trust and you take the time and you build the relationship
02:14:19.92 --> 02:14:23.92 and you prove over and over again that you're going to do the right thing and the right situation
02:14:23.92 --> 02:14:26.96 and that you're going to take accountability and responsibility when something goes wrong
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:31.12 and that you have a good head on your shoulders and that you're not going to get emotional about
02:14:31.12 --> 02:14:35.20 things and you do all those things and that you're driving and supporting the mission. Guess what
02:14:35.20 --> 02:14:38.24 you're going to get? You're going to get supported. Which means your boss is going to do what you want
02:14:38.24 --> 02:14:41.84 him to do. Yeah. Meanwhile, you do the same thing with the down the tuning of that. You're doing the same
02:14:41.84 --> 02:14:45.76 down. Exactly. It's like, you're doing that same thing. Yeah. It's crazy. Because you just, I don't know,
02:14:45.76 --> 02:14:52.80 it doesn't seem as intuitive, you know. Because it's the easiest excuse that anyone could ever have
02:14:52.80 --> 02:14:57.76 is, hey, you know what? My boss didn't give me what I needed. That's why I failed. Hey, you know what?
02:14:57.76 --> 02:15:02.56 Our boss is won't let us use chokeholds. Right. And therefore, we can't accomplish our mission.
02:15:02.56 --> 02:15:07.36 Well, no, guess what? I'm going to make, I'm going to lead up the chain of command and I'm going
02:15:07.36 --> 02:15:12.16 to get my superiors to let us do what we need to do to do it effectively. Because guess what?
02:15:12.16 --> 02:15:17.44 The leadership is lined. Your leadership is going to be aligned with what you want to do. Do you think
02:15:17.44 --> 02:15:26.48 that the leadership of the LAPD wants, you know, victor's suspects and purps to get your brain damage
02:15:26.48 --> 02:15:29.92 killed? No, they didn't want that. They wanted they wanted to be arrested properly. They didn't want
02:15:29.92 --> 02:15:33.84 to have lawsuits the whole nine yards. So if you're presenting something to them, that's going to
02:15:33.84 --> 02:15:38.80 improve them and move them towards the mission and support the ideals of what they're trying to
02:15:38.80 --> 02:15:42.08 get accomplished. Of course, you're going to get supported. Now, you're going to get these little
02:15:42.08 --> 02:15:46.16 political battles. But those are just part of the challenge. They're just part of making it happen.
02:15:46.16 --> 02:15:53.20 You know, that's part of the jujitsu. Yeah, when you're rolling the guy, don't expect him not to fight
02:15:53.20 --> 02:15:58.16 back. Yeah, they're going to fight back. Exactly right. Last question.
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.60 Jucko, do you think having an aggressive mindset is the same as being proactive?
02:16:09.04 --> 02:16:16.000 So I actually looked up the definition for these two words aggressive and proactive. So proactive
02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:23.68 is creating or controlling a situation by causing something to happen rather than responding to it
02:16:23.68 --> 02:16:32.80 after it has happened. An aggressive is ready or likely to attack or confront
02:16:34.32 --> 02:16:38.000 characterized by or resulting from aggression.
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:49.68 So you can see that the meanings, they're certainly similar. And I definitely think you have to be
02:16:51.12 --> 02:16:59.36 proactive in the world. You know, you want to be, you want to be dictating what happens,
02:16:59.36 --> 02:17:07.52 not responding to it. And yeah, that means creating or controlling a situation as much as you can.
02:17:08.32 --> 02:17:18.72 Right. So that's that's proactive. But being aggressive, that means you're ready to attack.
02:17:21.12 --> 02:17:26.24 As I always point out, that doesn't mean that you walk around with your chest puffed out,
02:17:26.24 --> 02:17:33.04 ready to bang heads with everyone around you. It doesn't mean you confront people all the time,
02:17:33.76 --> 02:17:40.88 physically or mentally head on without a tactically superior plan.
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:50.000 It doesn't mean you go straight forward into conflict without thought and without reason.
02:17:50.000 --> 02:18:00.80 Doesn't mean you engage in a Trishin warfare. No. That is almost never smart.
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:11.28 But what it does mean what aggression does mean is that you're going to get after it.
02:18:11.28 --> 02:18:19.44 You're going to move fast. You're going to think fast. You're going to outthink and outmaneuver the enemy.
02:18:22.24 --> 02:18:25.44 And if I think the enemy is going to attack me, I'm going to attack him first.
02:18:27.44 --> 02:18:33.52 And if I think the enemy is going to seize a piece of train, I'm going to be there waiting for him.
02:18:33.52 --> 02:18:43.84 And if the enemy is going to try and flank me too late, I'm already going to be flanking him.
02:18:46.88 --> 02:18:54.72 So I don't view aggression as an outward attitude.
02:18:54.72 --> 02:19:06.32 I view aggression as an internal character trait, a fire in your mind that says,
02:19:06.32 --> 02:19:14.56 I am going to win. I'm going to fight and I'm going to battle and I'm going to use every tool
02:19:14.56 --> 02:19:20.96 I have to crush my enemy. And that tool, it might be fists,
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:30.56 but it also might be a guy. And it could be a frontal attack,
02:19:33.44 --> 02:19:37.76 but it also might be a covert assassination.
02:19:40.56 --> 02:19:43.92 And it could be a vulgar display of power,
02:19:43.92 --> 02:19:54.16 but just as likely it could be a subtle political maneuver.
02:19:57.84 --> 02:20:04.08 That's what aggression is to me. The unstoppable fighting spirit, the drive,
02:20:04.08 --> 02:20:11.60 the burning desire to achieve mission success using every possible tool, every asset,
02:20:11.60 --> 02:20:15.20 and every strategy tactic to bring about victory.
02:20:18.96 --> 02:20:22.64 To me aggression is the will to win.
02:20:26.32 --> 02:20:31.28 And if that kind of internal and relentless aggression
02:20:33.36 --> 02:20:35.84 is your default mode,
02:20:35.84 --> 02:20:40.88 then you will win.
02:20:47.52 --> 02:20:51.28 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:20:53.36 --> 02:20:57.36 So, tell YouTubers out there,
02:20:59.20 --> 02:21:02.32 thanks for joining us in this conversation.
02:21:02.32 --> 02:21:06.72 Thanks for listening and subscribing.
02:21:06.72 --> 02:21:11.12 And if you like it, go through a little review on iTunes,
02:21:11.76 --> 02:21:13.52 or post it on your social media.
02:21:15.12 --> 02:21:17.60 So you do what you can to spread the word.
02:21:18.72 --> 02:21:23.12 So we can get more people out of the darkness
02:21:25.12 --> 02:21:26.16 and into the light.
02:21:26.16 --> 02:21:31.76 Thanks for connecting with us through the into webs.
02:21:31.76 --> 02:21:33.76 And if you don't know on Twitter,
02:21:34.40 --> 02:21:40.000 I'm at Jockel Willink and Echo is at Echo Charles.
02:21:42.40 --> 02:21:46.56 Give us a shout out there or ask us any questions you might have.
02:21:46.56 --> 02:21:51.92 And of course, thanks to the companies that support us.
02:21:51.92 --> 02:21:56.56 And please support the companies that support us.
02:21:56.56 --> 02:21:58.56 How can I do that Echo?
02:21:58.56 --> 02:21:59.36 It's true.
02:21:59.36 --> 02:22:01.36 Actually, back to the Twitter thing.
02:22:01.36 --> 02:22:03.20 That's your surprisingly,
02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.04 in easy to talk to on Twitter.
02:22:09.04 --> 02:22:11.04 So I know a lot of people,
02:22:11.04 --> 02:22:14.16 they'll be like maybe a follow-up question to some questions on here,
02:22:14.16 --> 02:22:15.44 or something that they've heard.
02:22:15.44 --> 02:22:17.60 Something that won't require a big long extended answer.
02:22:17.60 --> 02:22:21.36 And that's a, that's, I think, from what I've seen,
02:22:21.36 --> 02:22:23.84 and what I've experienced, that's a good place to ask.
02:22:23.84 --> 02:22:24.80 Yeah, for sure.
02:22:24.80 --> 02:22:26.32 Yeah, if you've got a question to ask on Twitter,
02:22:26.32 --> 02:22:28.08 I might just respond and say,
02:22:28.08 --> 02:22:31.84 no, I would never do that, or yes, that's an excellent idea,
02:22:31.84 --> 02:22:34.64 or whatever, or I might say,
02:22:34.64 --> 02:22:36.48 hey, I'm just going to answer that in a podcast.
02:22:36.48 --> 02:22:37.92 Yeah, that, it's a good spot though.
02:22:37.92 --> 02:22:40.08 I think it's not one of these things where you'll just be like,
02:22:40.08 --> 02:22:43.20 hey, Jockel will this and then it goes ignored.
02:22:43.20 --> 02:22:43.92 Not ignored.
02:22:43.92 --> 02:22:46.16 I mean, I don't know how long I'm going to keep this up for.
02:22:46.16 --> 02:22:48.32 I mean, there's going to be a lot of people on there,
02:22:48.32 --> 02:22:49.60 which is awesome.
02:22:49.60 --> 02:22:54.56 But I definitely will like anybody that puts something pertinent.
02:22:54.56 --> 02:22:55.76 Yeah.
02:22:55.76 --> 02:22:57.60 Man, somebody's taking some time to talk to me.
02:22:57.60 --> 02:22:59.44 I'm going to take some time to talk to you back.
02:22:59.44 --> 02:23:00.80 Yeah, that's a good man.
02:23:00.80 --> 02:23:02.80 And I tried to do the same thing, even though people are more just
02:23:02.80 --> 02:23:05.44 making jokes to me, which actually I prefer,
02:23:05.44 --> 02:23:06.96 because my answers are,
02:23:08.24 --> 02:23:09.76 may or may not be reliable.
02:23:09.76 --> 02:23:10.80 We'll just say that.
02:23:10.80 --> 02:23:11.12 Yeah.
02:23:11.12 --> 02:23:14.32 But if you want to support the podcast in other ways, of course,
02:23:14.32 --> 02:23:17.04 and you want to get some solid supplements,
02:23:17.04 --> 02:23:20.56 the only supplements that you take, right?
02:23:20.56 --> 02:23:21.20 Yes.
02:23:21.20 --> 02:23:22.48 And yeah, actually.
02:23:22.48 --> 02:23:25.44 Yeah, me too aside from weird pre-workout that I sometimes take.
02:23:25.44 --> 02:23:30.72 Only supplements I take is from on it, because quality is guaranteed.
