00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jockelfondcast number 261 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Being in the teams is the best job in the world. Probably heard me say that before, the best job in the world. Why do I say that?

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, first of all, the job itself, which consists of shooting machine guns, jumping out of airplanes, blowing things up, scuba diving, running around in the woods. It's just a freaking awesome job.

4
00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, so you got that. On top of that, you got this mission, the mission that you're focused on, you're on a mission to protect America, to protect democracy, to protect freedom, to protect people.

5
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And in order to do that, kill bad guys. Because you're supposed to do all that protecting, in order to do all that protecting, you got to kill bad guys, which, which has a kid and really as a man for that matter, that's what me and my friends always wanted to do. And I'm sorry if that doesn't sit right with you.

6
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Or if you think I'm some kind of a monster because of it, but that, that's the reality.

7
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So that's another reason why the job is awesome. But the last thing and certainly not the least thing, in fact, the best thing about the job, by far, is the boys.

8
00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The guys you get to work with. They're, they're awesome. And contrary to popular belief, there's no cookie cutter format that represents a guy in the field teams.

9
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Your guys coming all shapes and sizes, they come from all different backgrounds.

10
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And it should be noted that not all of them are good guys. There are some knuckleheads for sure. There's some ego maniacs. There's some guys that really aren't part of the team.

11
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There's some guys that look out for themselves. There's guys that don't help out. There's some guys that don't care about the mission.

12
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There's guys that put themselves above the team.

13
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So there's, there's some of those types running around. And that's true in any organization. But as a whole,

14
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the boys are pretty legit. There are working, they're tough. They put the team first.

15
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
They get the mission done.

16
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They have fun while they're doing it. And you can count them on them.

17
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Which is an underrated thing, right? You can count on them.

18
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I was lucky enough to work with a ton of those guys during my career.

19
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I was leaving Ramadi. So at the end of my last appointment, and I was leaving Ramadi and another task unit came in to take our place.

20
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And they were coming into a complete and utter firestorm of sustained combat.

21
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And look, we had all been deploying a bunch over the years since 9 to 11. And this was 2006.

22
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Sort of the end of 2006. And so guys knew what it was like to go on combat deployments.

23
00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But this particular combat deployment that we had been on in the Battle of Ramadi was significant. We had a lot of casualties.

24
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And these guys that were coming to replace us.

25
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I mean, I knew that they were coming into something that Seals hadn't deployed into in a long time.

26
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And look, I'm not saying that Seals weren't deploying into dangerous places. They were, but kind of a known scenario like that.

27
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It'd been a while.

28
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so I felt horrible, actually. I felt horrible for the new task unit that was showing up to replace us.

29
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Because I felt like we had learned so much there. We had gotten good at our jobs.

30
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And I felt like we were leaving this other task unit in a bad spot.

31
00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I was worried about them and worried how they would survive.

32
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Well, I knew a few of their guys.

33
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A few of their guys I knew. And that gave me a level of comfort.

34
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
One of the guys that I knew was the senior enlisted guy of the task unit, the guy named Steve Ward.

35
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
One of the good guys. And I kind of knew him tangently over the years.

36
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Because I had turned over with him in Baghdad a couple years earlier.

37
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He'd been in a leadership position in a platoon at Team 5 and run a bunch of operations and done a great job.

38
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And I'd gotten a solid turn over from him. So that was awesome.

39
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And it just made my comfort level go up that someone was coming in.

40
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That was humble enough to listen and learn not just from me, not just from task unit bruiser, but also from the army in the Marine Corps.

41
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And who is also smart enough and knowledgeable enough to mix in that knowledge and that experience with humility and make sense of the whole crazy situation.

42
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Which is what he did. And when Steve came back from that deployment, which was a hard deployment for them, we ended up working together.

43
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Actually, actually truly working together for the first time at trade at the training command.

44
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
He took over the land warfare, training cell as the senior enlisted advisor in that training block.

45
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And we ended up spending a lot of time together training and preparing seals for combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

46
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And it was a...

47
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's hard for me to even say it was a challenging job. Yeah, it was a challenging job.

48
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But it was so critical and it was so rewarding to be able to work with the young frogmen and pass on the lessons learned to the next generation.

49
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000
So that they could go out there and take the fight to the enemy and keep themselves safe as safe as they possibly could.

50
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And I've actually retired out of that job and Steve carried on in his career. You went on to more senior positions of leadership and continued to deploy over and over again in support of the war on terror.

51
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Until a few months ago when he finally retired.

52
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And since then, we've been working together again. Still...

53
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
...still actually training leaders this time for leadership in the business world. But we're back at it.

54
00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And it is an honor to be working with Steve again. And it is an honor to have Steve here on the podcast to tell us about his life, his experiences, and his lessons learned.

55
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Steve, thanks for coming all, man.

56
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it, Juggle.

57
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You were one of the guys in the beginning when this podcast kind of kicked off that was given me reports from the field that you were in the game listening to it.

58
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Yeah, me and Gardner go on back and forth. You know, in some of the books you covered early on, like the last hundred yards, and I was like damn.

59
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
How could you not get on the net and listen to that for a couple hours? So that was good.

60
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yeah, and here you are sitting in the chair. Let's go. Let's rock and roll. Let's talk about where Steve word came from.

61
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Yep. So group in Sacramento, California, small town. My mom and dad were divorced. So I'd go see my dad in the summer months and my sister and my mom and I, we all grouped the other Sacramento.

62
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I graduated high school in 91.

63
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Would you slow your roll, bro?

64
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yeah, so we got a list of cover.

65
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Come on.

66
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So would you let your mom do? Would your mom do for 11?

67
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So she worked at a Davis college. She was like an administrator there.

68
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And then what about your dad? Where was your dad? So my dad, he was an air traffic controller. So we kind of bounced around the US.

69
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It's been a lot of time and floor to Puerto Rico up in Washington.

70
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Did you see much of your dad growing up?

71
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yeah, in the summertime, I mean, my sister gone and see him for anywhere from two weeks to 30 days in the time.

72
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So it's good.

73
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Well, so it's good.

74
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So you just breeze through like, oh, when Ty is going to graduate, you were about to be in the Navy.

75
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Well, we did play sports.

76
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Yes.

77
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So played a baseball soccer football coming up.

78
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Any good? I'd say I was an average athlete.

79
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Nothing special.

80
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I wasn't consistent. I had good. Like for baseball, I had times and I was doing good.

81
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And then I'd get in the slump and when do so good.

82
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Slump due to bad attitude.

83
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Slump from, I'm trying to think of a good way to work this here.

84
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Slump from up. I guess being good enough.

85
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
You know, like you get, so I was a pitcher. I played baseball. I played pitcher and I played outfield.

86
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And I'd have some times where I'd get up there and, you know, my friends would be cracking jokes.

87
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I mean, you're going to be in the first batter. You're going to be in the first batter.

88
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You're going to be in the first batter. First pitch. I'm being the first batter.

89
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Like damn. You know, you can't crack.

90
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Crack jokes up on the mound because you just hit somebody with a baseball.

91
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, you know, didn't pan out too good for me. So my junior, I kind of quit baseball.

92
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And my freshman year, I started playing football. And I really enjoyed football.

93
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Contacts sport. Hard. Like a lot of hard work goes into that.

94
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So I enjoyed football. Finish that up my senior year. I played all four years.

95
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And soccer. I kind of quit playing that when I was probably like around 13, 14 years old.

96
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
What kind of what were your friends doing when you weren't playing sports?

97
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Get in trouble. Get in trouble. So sports.

98
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
You know, I was probably like, I wouldn't say a bad kid, but I was definitely off the path.

99
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
7th, 8th and 9th grade. Not good thanks for me.

100
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
You know, I got, I was picking up trash on the side of the road. Those are on probation. Just doing stupid shit.

101
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
For what? Just nothing. I cared for Peter.

102
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Just, uh, what do they call that? Delinquent. Delinquents.

103
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I was a delinquent. And it wasn't my friends. It was me.

104
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I was a guy that was like, one of the, when my friends came around, I was the guy instigating and kind of leading the charge on doing.

105
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What kind of music were you listening to?

106
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I just whatever. Like country rap rock I did, my just didn't matter.

107
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We had the old AMFM rados or anything. That's going on. There's a different time.

108
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah. You were limited to what you could actually hear. Yeah. Was it a small town?

109
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Um, yeah. So I grew up actually in West Side.

110
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I was definitely a small town. Okay.

111
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, yeah, small town, smaller high school.

112
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I went to high school called River City. Um, that was small.

113
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Did they have wrestling there?

114
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They had, they started a wrestling program. I think when I was in about 10th grade there.

115
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I didn't, I didn't wrestle. I played football. I stayed away from basketball.

116
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Um, yeah.

117
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
How was your grades? I'm really a convention.

118
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Not good. Not, they were not good. I passed high school by the, you know, barely passed high school.

119
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So it wasn't good for me. I didn't pay attention. Had good teachers always given you good advice.

120
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was just not in the learning.

121
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So you were a little bit of a trouble maker, right?

122
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Do you think when you were being a trouble maker?

123
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Do you think you were doing it for attention? Do you think you were doing it for the thrill?

124
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Do you think you were doing it for adrenaline? Like why do you think you were doing it?

125
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I think when I was a, which I was, I think of a lot of it.

126
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:23.000
What I was doing to sort of prove to myself and my friends that I was like, uh, uh,

127
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
tough like type things. Like I don't care. I'll do this like that kind of thing.

128
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
When I think back as to why I did dumb shit, which I did plenty of,

129
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I think that's why a lot of it was like to prove that I was a quote and I'm putting in big air quotes here,

130
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
tough because the stuff I was doing was by no stretch of the imagination, tough.

131
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Yep. I'd say I fallen that same category trying to prove something just doing,

132
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and I got our journal journal and rush out of doing those dumb things.

133
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it took a long time to get out of my system.

134
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So you said that was mostly six, seven, eight, ninth grade, seven, eighth and ninth.

135
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Yeah. By tenth grade, were you kind of a little bit more square to, uh, turn in the corner?

136
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yes. Yep. Did you feel, did you have some runs with a law that kind of straightened you back out?

137
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Provation and picking up trash on the side of the road.

138
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Hmm. Kind of scored me where we'll get away with a little more interest.

139
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You're in the van with all the rest of the delinquents.

140
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You're on the road on Saturday and Sundays. Not a good situation.

141
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So then you graduate, you barely graduate high school.

142
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
At what point did you think about joining the Navy or did you think about the joining the Marine Corps or the Army?

143
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Where did you, what was the situation with and listing in the military?

144
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So I remember one of my high school teachers told me, hey, you got three choices when you get out of high school.

145
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And he's kind of mentoring us and none of us know it at the time, but he's like, hey, you can go to college,

146
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
which I highly recommend, you can get a job or you can join the military.

147
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Or you can do a company that's not going to be a good job.

148
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You can get a job or you can join the military. Or you can do a combination of one and two.

149
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And that kind of always stuck with me.

150
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You know, and then as I started going in college, like, man, I just, I don't want to learn.

151
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I wasn't ready to learn.

152
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Wait a second. So you just skipped right to your in college.

153
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So when you, when you're still in high school, you didn't join the Navy or join the military while you're in high school.

154
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Correct. He gave you the three options.

155
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Job, college, military, you chose college.

156
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yes. First.

157
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Yep.

158
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You thought, all right, did you have any freaking vision of any kind whatsoever you just like know sign up for whatever classes they signed me up for?

159
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Yeah. So I just signed up for the basic general education stuff.

160
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You know, went for a full semester and then dove into the second semester.

161
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And that's where like a one point. I don't know how to recruit or wound up at our door, but the recruit or wound up on our doorstep.

162
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And I started talking to him and we used to do a step of what your house of the house.

163
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You know, you go through and I was like, yeah, this is something I think I might be in a rescue map.

164
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Your mom called the dam recruiter in Santa Monica.

165
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Oh, she was kicking him out of there.

166
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Oh, really? She was not having any other recruiter. She told him to get that out of here.

167
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Oh, he did.

168
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Was your mom a hippie or something?

169
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
No, no. She's a farm girl. She grew a farm.

170
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Yeah, she just didn't. She didn't want me join the military.

171
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Hmm.

172
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But you talked to him.

173
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I talked to him and was he a Navy recruiter?

174
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Navy guy. Yep.

175
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Navy recruiter.

176
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Did you have any inklet? Did you have any parents, grandparents? Anything about the military?

177
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Yep. You so stood?

178
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Yes.

179
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So my grandfather was in the army and he was he never went.

180
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
He was around the World War Two, but he never went and served.

181
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You know, he got stationed out in Alaska somewhere.

182
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And then my dad was in the Air Force.

183
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So I had some small touch points there with some cool stories of, you know, grandfather being in the military.

184
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
He was talking about throwing his grenade in the sergeant was telling that was the best throw ever type thing.

185
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And then my dad was in the Air Force.

186
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Your grandfather was getting told you're going to beam the batter with that grenade.

187
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah.

188
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Yeah.

189
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So then so the guy took the recruiter talks to you.

190
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And at this point, you realize college is like the waste of your time.

191
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Yes.

192
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I'm done with school in the school.

193
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
How did you enjoy high school?

194
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And I definitely wasn't enjoying college at that point.

195
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Which college was it?

196
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I was just called Saxity Community College.

197
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So you're living at home during this time?

198
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Yes.

199
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Yeah.

200
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Living at home working part time going to college.

201
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
What was your part time job?

202
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I mean, I don't remember what it was.

203
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I had a couple of jobs growing up.

204
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I worked in a bunch of different little restaurants being a bus boy being a dishwasher,

205
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
a booth furniture with a guy named Craig is great family guy.

206
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And so we get on the road.

207
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
You work for a light furniture.

208
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
We'd be trucking on down Delle with furniture on the back of his big old eating wheeler.

209
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I was actually a good job.

210
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
It was hard work, but a paid good money.

211
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
It was paying 10 bucks an hour back then.

212
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
That was good money.

213
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
You kind of the man with 10 bucks an hour.

214
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It was the man with 10 bucks an hour.

215
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Yeah.

216
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And that was a lot better paid than the Navy paid you.

217
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I'll tell you that back then.

218
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So how did the Navy recruit or convince you?

219
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He was just like, hey, come in and give this a go, man.

220
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And so I went through, did all that as a bad test.

221
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And he's like, right, we can get you in in June timeframe.

222
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And what job were you signing up for?

223
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Because you didn't list.

224
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Did you know about the seals at this point?

225
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
No, I didn't.

226
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I never.

227
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I didn't know what the seal was.

228
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
So I just, I was signing up to go to the regular Navy to go on a ship.

229
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Day to figure life out.

230
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Yep.

231
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Little did I know.

232
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It was about to get after some bathroom cleaning.

233
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
So so what, like job that he sell you on.

234
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
He didn't sell me.

235
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
He was just like, I mean, so I had.

236
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I grew up with some friends and they, you know, a lot of people are getting in trouble.

237
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
People are doing drugs, all that kind of dumb stuff.

238
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
So I just knew I had the best option for me at that point in my life.

239
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Was to get out of Sacramento and go try something different.

240
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So the job, I, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

241
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Did you go to, did you go UD undesignated?

242
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Yes.

243
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Oh, damn.

244
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Yeah.

245
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So I was in, you know.

246
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So for people that don't know, like in the Navy, you have a job.

247
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It's called your rating.

248
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And your job is, you know, you might be a welder.

249
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
You might be a technician or an engine man that's going to work on engines.

250
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Or you might run a weapon system.

251
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
They have names for all these different jobs.

252
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
But if you don't have a job, they call it, and I remember this from bootcamp.

253
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
They was a threat.

254
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
They'd say, you keep this up.

255
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You're going to go to the fleet UD undesignated.

256
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
We mean you have no job, no skill.

257
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
You're just going to go in there.

258
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So that threat that I got told was actually what you got signed up for.

259
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Go to the fleet UD undesignated.

260
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Sign me up already.

261
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Roll.

262
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Get me out of the sack.

263
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yeah.

264
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Get me out of here.

265
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
So you rolled into bootcamp.

266
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Yep.

267
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Roll into bootcamp.

268
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Fennish up.

269
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
I want to say right around October time frame.

270
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
So when did bootcamp win?

271
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
When did you go to bootcamp in July 1991?

272
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Okay.

273
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And then did you go to Orlando?

274
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
No, no.

275
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Here in San Diego.

276
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Oh, you went to San Diego.

277
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
That's right.

278
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
West Coast.

279
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
So you went to bootcamp.

280
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
And you just went to bootcamp eight week.

281
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
It was eight weeks.

282
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I think you had weeks.

283
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
You went to eight weeks of bootcamp.

284
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And then to the fleet.

285
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Oh, yeah, eight weeks of bootcamp.

286
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Then I went to Seaman training.

287
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Because I was going to work in Debt Department.

288
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
That was my own designating.

289
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I'm going to be, you know, Seaman.

290
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
So got trained up for three weeks there.

291
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And then showed up to a ship sometime.

292
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
And I think November December timeframe.

293
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Of 91.

294
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Bro.

295
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Yeah.

296
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Yeah.

297
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Yeah.

298
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Hey.

299
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Jocco.

300
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It's not that funny.

301
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
That's crazy, dude.

302
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Yeah.

303
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Well, you must have done good on your ass.

304
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Vabs.

305
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
That guy didn't try and make you into like whatever.

306
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Some other rates we could get more.

307
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
No.

308
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
That's crazy.

309
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Dude.

310
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Well, that's in.

311
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So that was probably my first lesson learned in life.

312
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Hey, pay attention in school.

313
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
So you score good on your ass.

314
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
So you have option.

315
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Right.

316
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Hey, when you're in high school, you don't.

317
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I didn't.

318
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I really thought about that.

319
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I just need to make it through.

320
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah.

321
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
In life, you're going to be given some test.

322
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Well, you're going to go working a fire department, a police department.

323
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
You're going to go in the military.

324
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And so the better edge educated you are, the more options you're going to have available to.

325
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And I didn't do so good.

326
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
So my options were limited.

327
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Hey.

328
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Yeah.

329
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
That's the one thing I always try and explain when like parents ask me about kids and like what the.

330
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:21.000
And I think one of the biggest things you can do for a kid, the size getting them in a duty to is making them realize that their actions today have impact on the rest of their life.

331
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
We get little kids and when I say little kids, I'm talking me when I was 23, right?

332
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
What I'm doing right now is going to impact where I'm going to be, right?

333
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And so you how can you expect a 13 year old or a 15 year old?

334
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And you know girls, I feel a little bit smarter than boys.

335
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It's possible.

336
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
It seems judging from my own children.

337
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Anyways, let me let me phrase X. I don't want to generalize in my personal family.

338
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
It seems like my daughters are a little better at connecting.

339
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And what they're doing right now with the future than my son who just doesn't do it as much.

340
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
So yeah, that's a good point.

341
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And when you realize it, what I'm doing right now as a kid,

342
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and it's not just kids, what I'm doing right now is a human is going to impact away my life goes.

343
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Yep.

344
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And you might end up in the fleet, you do.

345
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
You do.

346
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Get after it.

347
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
So so you do eight weeks of boot camp, three weeks of.

348
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
You know, you're going to be a prep school, you know,

349
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
and then boom, you go to a ship.

350
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Yep.

351
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
What was that wake up call like?

352
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It wasn't bad.

353
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
It wasn't bad.

354
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
It was probably one of the best things that I've ever been to me.

355
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Well, in what way?

356
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Yeah, I just, it was, it was a lot of hard work.

357
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
You know, so when you show up in Dr. Parvint and you're an E2,

358
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
you're getting every, you know,

359
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
you're getting all the assignments that are not fun to do.

360
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
You know, you're cleaning bathrooms, you're painting the ship,

361
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
you're just doing all the things on ship maintenance.

362
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And so you're eating some humble pie for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

363
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Why you're doing this?

364
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Give me a chance to kind of grow up a little bit.

365
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
It was good.

366
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
It was hard work.

367
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I'd roll the sleeves up and get dirty.

368
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Yeah, you had time to reflect.

369
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Yeah.

370
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Time to reflect.

371
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
What were you thinking about when you were reflecting?

372
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
I was, so when I'm reflecting on that,

373
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
I'm just like, hey man, you can make the best out of this situation.

374
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
So I had one of my buddies that I went through boot camp with.

375
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
We wound up on the same ship, Chris, and me and him just always had competition.

376
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
We got put into the same deck department, and every assignment they gave us,

377
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
we're like, we're running up and down them, sterile with ladders, just a little day.

378
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
You know, completing assignments, coming back, like, hey, what else do you got from me?

379
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Like hey, you knuckleheads, that's supposed to take you to lunchtime.

380
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
We're like, well, we're done. Give us more.

381
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
That's awesome, man.

382
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So it was, it was fun. We made the best of it.

383
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
You know, and we had some good, some good leadership on the ship,

384
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and some bad leadership. You got to, that was my first exposure to kind of what right looks like.

385
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
What bad leadership looks like.

386
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
So it was good, and you're taking down all these data points, and you're stormed it in your head, you know.

387
00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000
And probably one of the biggest things I took out of that assignment is we had guys that were super knowledgeable,

388
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
just very good. Like, we had a BM2, and he was super good at being a boesimate.

389
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
He knew everything, how to tie all the ropes, all the maintenance, he knew everything.

390
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And he was square away, hard worker looked out for his guys.

391
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Like, that's a dude I want to be like.

392
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
You know, he's talking about Esslime front, eight modeling, the correct behaviors.

393
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
That dude is modeling all the right behaviors.

394
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Busted his ass, did good things, and he was getting promoted while he was on that ship.

395
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
So you're like, on that, that a point.

396
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
That's what right looks like. Same thing with the handful of chiefs around that ship.

397
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Just good solid dudes. They weren't afraid to roll their sleeves up, get in there with the guys,

398
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
and get to work.

399
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
You know, like, all right, check.

400
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Mental note on that.

401
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So then how long, how long was it when you were in the fleet until you heard about the deans?

402
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Yeah. So we had a couple guys that didn't make it through sil training.

403
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
They showed up, came friends with those guys at some point.

404
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
They told me all about, you know, basic underwater demolition sil training.

405
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And I was like, damn, that's something I'm in and rest at in.

406
00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
So I started training up, they told me kind of all the things you need to do to be successful.

407
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
They took me over to the obstacle court, course showed me all the tricks on how to navigate that thing,

408
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
a lot of technique.

409
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
In the meantime, I was getting my application together and submit everything.

410
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So when I hit the two-year mark on the ship, I'd had my application back.

411
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I was approved to go to a sealed training and everything was dialed in as tight as it could be.

412
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
No matter what I was going to have to do two years on that ship.

413
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
So you weren't even close to your two years yet, and you already had your application in?

414
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
I would say I had it in right around the probably 13, 14 months cycle.

415
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So you owed whatever, whatever the month were.

416
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
The other year or something like that, 10 months left.

417
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Yep.

418
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Yep, something like that before they'd release you.

419
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Yeah, and the cool thing was, you know, we had two, my division master chief was an E9.

420
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Obviously he was a good dude and then our CMC or Command Master Chief of the ship was a good guy.

421
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And they're like, hey man, you work hard, you stay out of trouble, we'll make some phone calls.

422
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
We'll make sure that you get a shot at going to Buds.

423
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And they didn't have to do that, you know, they could have been like, hey, pack sand, Jack, you want to get off the ship.

424
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Get out of the fleet and go to some other program.

425
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
That's not helping us out.

426
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
They didn't do that.

427
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
They looked out for me, you know, working hard, staying out of trouble, being a good person, all those three things were good.

428
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
You know, so again, it was kind of like reinforcing good behaviors.

429
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
So always be thankful to those guys.

430
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
And then the guys that showed up that had been to Buds, what kind of impression did that give you?

431
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Did you?

432
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Because there's a weird thing that somehow you have to think that you can actually do it, right?

433
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah.

434
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Or, you know, like, for me, I was like, I can do this, which is a really arrogant thing to think, right?

435
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
It's arrogant to think most people quit, but I'm going to be able to do it.

436
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Yeah.

437
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I wouldn't sure where I was going to shake out on the whole thing beyond with the, I didn't like run long distance and grown up.

438
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
You know, we did a lot of sprints and football.

439
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And I wasn't good with Polips.

440
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
That's so Polips, I was, I definitely sucked at it.

441
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And I was like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do the amount of Polips that are needed to do it.

442
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
So I just started working hard on my Polips.

443
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Got on a good running program.

444
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Got on a good swimming program.

445
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Those guys taught me how to do the sidestroke.

446
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And so, you know, I just get up early morning and knock all this stuff out.

447
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Going and either do a weightlifting program and then do my cardio at lunchtime or vice versa.

448
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And every now and then those guys that come with me like a dial this and work on this.

449
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Look at that.

450
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So I was, I was mentally and physically prepared for first face on what to expect.

451
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
These guys that give me so much information.

452
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Did those guys talk about what happened to them?

453
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Yeah, so one of the two of the guys, one of the guys made a past hell week.

454
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Another guy was in second phase and he got a drop for a full comp and then the other guy he was.

455
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
He got up right around the third week mark for a week mark in first phase and he got injured and he got rolled out.

456
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Got a drop for pool comp and second phase up and then what did you see the other one was?

457
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000
The one guy made it past hell week and something happened when he was waiting a class up for second phase and they dropped them.

458
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
And then the third guy he made it I think to like week three or four.

459
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And then got hurt or quit.

460
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
I think he, well, he said he got, so you know, no one ever quit.

461
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Yeah.

462
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Yeah, no one ever quit.

463
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So you had a pretty good idea of what you're going into.

464
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah, because I can tell you I didn't have anybody that I didn't know anyone that went to seal training at all.

465
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
You know, because I was in the civilian world.

466
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
So for me, I didn't know what pool comp was.

467
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
I didn't understand anything.

468
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
It was just a blank open nothing and do nothing.

469
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But you had a decent idea of what was going to be coming.

470
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Yep.

471
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Yep.

472
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I could, I was physically and mentally prepared for first phase.

473
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Did you get your pull-up square away?

474
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I did.

475
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
I actually went in a little better with my pull-ups and you know,

476
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
the deal when you show up and you start classing up.

477
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
You're starting from scratch again.

478
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
So now you're, from where I came in, I was coming back down with,

479
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000
you know, my run times and swim times and all that stuff.

480
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Meaning you were in better shape than what was required.

481
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Yes.

482
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Which is the way you freaking should try and get there.

483
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yep.

484
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yep.

485
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So you showed the buds.

486
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Did you get what you expected?

487
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Yes.

488
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Yeah, I was, feel as full benefit.

489
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
So it was good times.

490
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Well, classroom unit.

491
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I was in 194.

492
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
So we start we classed up.

493
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I want to say right around January of 1994.

494
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
What do you have the, do you have problems with anything?

495
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
In buds?

496
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Yeah.

497
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Oh yeah.

498
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Yeah.

499
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So first phase, first phase and third phase were,

500
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
those came a lot more natural to me.

501
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
I grew up hunting and fishing and shooting guns and doing all that fun stuff.

502
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
So third phase wasn't bad. First phase I was mentally prepared for second phase.

503
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
I'd never scuba dive and never did any diving.

504
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And for me, that was the hardest phase.

505
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
You know, actually filled a couple events in there.

506
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Like I filled pool comp the first go around.

507
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
You know, then when I did my retest, I passed it and then like every little thing,

508
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
you know, you're doing ditch and dawn.

509
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
You're doing all these little things with scuba tanks and going down and doing stuff.

510
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I was jacking it all up.

511
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And for me, my learning style, I really have to digest.

512
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
You know, what it is I need to do and kind of like visualize it.

513
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
And things were on a quick tempo for dive phase.

514
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
So it wasn't, yeah, it wasn't good for me.

515
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Where did you feel like you're on the bubble the whole time?

516
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Like when I filled pool comp, I was like, all right, damn, I'm not going to make it through this man.

517
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
You know, you're on the wall of shame.

518
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
That doesn't help either you're looking at directional and jeez.

519
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I filled pool comp too.

520
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Yeah.

521
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
I had our ops guy from train at our ops war and officer from train at, put me through.

522
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Yeah.

523
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Pool comp.

524
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Savage.

525
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Yeah.

526
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
He just, well, you know what's crazy with pool comp?

527
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Like I'm going through and in my head, I had the procedures down.

528
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And I thought I did good.

529
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I'm like, I'm down there tying the wami knot, you know, all the shit.

530
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
And I'm like, I'm cool, I'm a collect.

531
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I'm going through the procedures and the structure just yanks me up by the tank.

532
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
She's like, you failed.

533
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Get on the wall and I was like, damn seriously, like I'm going through trying to think of what I did wrong.

534
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
I'm like, I thought I was good, you know, but I didn't know if they were playing.

535
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I didn't know if they were playing games with me or what, but I went over the wall and I was like, shit, I don't know if I'm going to make it.

536
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
That guy that failed me, who's a great guy.

537
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
But when he, he's same thing.

538
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
He had me down there.

539
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I was down there.

540
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Pool comp was 30 minutes when I went through and I know they showed that at some point to 20 minutes,

541
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
but when I went through it was 30 minutes.

542
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And he just, what he did was he just, he ripped my mask off and then he just started doing like a bob.

543
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
And he would bob down.

544
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
He would come down.

545
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
He would just knock the regular out of my mouth.

546
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
And then he'd go back up and I would grab the regular and I put it back in.

547
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I'd clear it and then he'd knock it out again.

548
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And he did that for 19 minutes.

549
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Damn.

550
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And then I just kept replacing it and every one of those breaths was a nightmare because you're trying to,

551
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I just got, got, got, got, get the water out of there, swallowing some of the water and then get a breath and then,

552
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
and then boom, he'd knock it out again.

553
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And you can't defend yourself.

554
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
You can't protect yourself and you can't panic.

555
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
So I just kept doing it.

556
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
And then at 19 minutes he just comes down and gives me the thumbs up, come to the surface.

557
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
And I come up and I'm like, I feel fine.

558
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And he goes, he goes, you don't look comfortable down there. You fail.

559
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And I was like, okay.

560
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So I guess that's that.

561
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Roger that.

562
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Yeah.

563
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
What's a whammy knot?

564
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Like they just tighten this complex knot.

565
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
It's like a multiple knot and we're not on that.

566
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Okay. So it's not like a specific method allegeer.

567
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Is it just like a generally speaking jam on that?

568
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
So during this evolution called pool competency,

569
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
also known as pool comp pool comp.

570
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
They want to make sure that you are beyond fully

571
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
comfortable in the water.

572
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
You will not pass this if you're not comfortable in the water.

573
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Zero percent chance.

574
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
So what they do is they they cause problems.

575
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
You have these old school scuba gear on like jaccoo stow style stuff.

576
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
No, they can be big hoses.

577
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
One hose goes in and one hose comes out.

578
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And they're just like rubber hoses.

579
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
And they start taking these things.

580
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And they first they start off the knock off your mask.

581
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
They rip off your fins.

582
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
They pull your regulator out.

583
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And then they start pulling your regulator out.

584
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
And then like undoing your thing.

585
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
And eventually they pull it out and put it behind you.

586
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Pull your regulator behind you and tie it.

587
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And then not you got to take your gear off.

588
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Pull the rig over your back.

589
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Untie the knot.

590
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Start breathing again.

591
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Put everything back on in order.

592
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Following the procedures.

593
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
As soon as you get it back on,

594
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
boom they hit you again.

595
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
And so they keep doing this.

596
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
And eventually they give you what's called a whammy knot.

597
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Which is a knot that you cannot get out.

598
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You won't come out.

599
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
So now what you have to do is ditch your rig.

600
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Which means you have to take it off.

601
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
You have to lay it on the bottom of the pool.

602
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
You have to take your weight belt off and place it on top of the tank.

603
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
So they don't float.

604
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Then you have to kiss your your your kiss your manifold.

605
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
You kiss your manifold.

606
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Oh no.

607
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
You request permission to go up.

608
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
They give you permission.

609
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
You know, you give them a thumbs up.

610
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
They give you a like an okay thumbs up.

611
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Then you kiss your manifold.

612
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
And then you blow and go to the surface.

613
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And kiss your manifold.

614
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
You literally the part of the scuba tank is called the manifolds where the regulator kind of comes out of.

615
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
You kiss that.

616
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Like why?

617
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
I don't get it.

618
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Because those are the procedures.

619
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So that's the deal.

620
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Okay, like you got to follow these directions kind of kiss your manifold.

621
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Right.

622
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Did you have to kiss your manifolds?

623
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Yes.

624
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So you kiss your manifold.

625
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
And then you blow and go.

626
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Which means you're not going to give yourself an air ambulism by the air expanding your lungs.

627
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
And then you go to the surface.

628
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
You blow and go to the surface.

629
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
When you get to the surface, you give a thumbs up and you say, I feel fine.

630
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
And they either say, you know, good job.

631
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
You passed or they say, you looked uncomfortable with you failed.

632
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Which for me, they said you looked uncomfortable with you failed.

633
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And then for Steve, they said you looked uncomfortable with you failed.

634
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I would say the one thing that's different about me was I did good on everything else.

635
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
So when I failed, who compiles I called God?

636
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Like this is it.

637
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I'm I'm going to fail super sketched out.

638
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Yeah, not me.

639
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
That wasn't my first time failing.

640
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So you like failed like getting down on and on.

641
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Body breathe.

642
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I was good on the buddy breathe.

643
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Ditch and dawn and something else.

644
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
I don't know what else I felt.

645
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
It was like three things.

646
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
You know what I was like?

647
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
My buddy breathe partner was a freakin' rest there from Iowa.

648
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
He was a beast of a guy.

649
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
But he was a total freakin' panic in the water.

650
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
This dude would take the freakin' buddy breathe from me.

651
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Cause you're using one set of scuba tanks.

652
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
He would take it and just breathe off of it for like a long time.

653
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And then I'd be like, hey, you know, like giving a single leg.

654
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I need that right now.

655
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
You know, and so he'd give it back to me.

656
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
And as soon as I took one breath, he'd be like, you know,

657
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
give me the signal.

658
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
He needs more.

659
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Hmm.

660
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
But you passed the second time.

661
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Yep, passed it.

662
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Made it out.

663
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Made it.

664
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Made it in the third phase.

665
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And then third phase was.

666
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
On eventful.

667
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
He's, you know, you're just doing a lot of run and swimming in shooting.

668
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
So it was, that was a lot easier than second phase for me.

669
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
And running you were good.

670
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Running good.

671
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I had all my run times down before I went into Buds.

672
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I wasn't so concerned about running.

673
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I was just worried about kind of getting injured.

674
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Slimming.

675
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
What about the open ocean swims?

676
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Good to go.

677
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
No factor.

678
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
No factor.

679
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Did you, you are on her man?

680
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

681
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
So I, so when you were firing the gut?

682
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Yeah, so the way they press it dude.

683
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Yeah, the way they've worked it is I think we voted the fire

684
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
and the gut before the oner man results came out.

685
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
You know, the class voted that for me knows that card.

686
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
That's awesome.

687
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And they're like, hey, Ward, you got oner man too.

688
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And I was like, all right, check Roger that.

689
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Well, well, well, well, the reason I say that's impressive is.

690
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
The oner man is usually somebody that's like it does really well in all the events,

691
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
like running swimming.

692
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Oh, of course.

693
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And the fire and the gut is usually a guy that like doesn't.

694
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Yeah.

695
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
It's a guy that had to kind of grill through it and go through it to pass.

696
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Yeah.

697
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Like in my class, it was Jeff Higgs, who had hypothermia multiple times,

698
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
like five or six times and he just, he showed back up to buzz,

699
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
even though they kicked him out, he showed up.

700
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
The class in his Dunga Rees and just kept doing it.

701
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
So he got firing gut, like of course.

702
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
And then oner man was Keith Cameroys, the total start athlete.

703
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
But for you to get both of those, that's pretty freaking.

704
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Yeah.

705
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
So how did you even get that?

706
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I don't know.

707
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
I don't know man.

708
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I don't know.

709
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000
I didn't feel like it.

710
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Were you one of the leading guys and were you an e4 at this point?

711
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
So yeah, I'd made e4 off the ship before I went to buzz.

712
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
So I showed up the buzz and I was an e4 already.

713
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Were you the class leading petty officer?

714
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
No, I was a second class nurse.

715
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
No, we had a second class and there and I think eventually we had a,

716
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
you know, he got the guy, our original LP, he got stress fractures and had real bad

717
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
chance points.

718
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
So we got rolled on and another guy came in and now he took over the class

719
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
he'll be able to up.

720
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So was he a week like for you?

721
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
I'll tell you what, how week wasn't.

722
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.

723
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
It sucks for everyone.

724
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
I had enough gas on my tank.

725
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I think I could have went one more day.

726
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
But you know, it was manageable.

727
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Yeah, it was manageable.

728
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
We just had a guy on who ended up in SF,

729
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
but he went to buzz and he didn't make it through buzz.

730
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
But he said buzz is really, really hard.

731
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
You know, he's like, it's because if you're thinking you're going to go there,

732
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
you're going to get what you ask for.

733
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
For me, how week was kind of cool because I wasn't the best runner.

735
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
I wasn't the best runner.

736
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I wasn't the best swimmer.

737
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
And so it was like hard for me.

738
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Like I had to put out super hard to pass those evolutions and I had the fear of

739
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
failing.

740
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Yeah.

741
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
And and and hell, you, there's no time limit on there's no time limit on the

742
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
have illusions just keep going and I'm pretty good at keeping going.

743
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
That's, that's a, that's a good thing.

744
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I'm good at just keep going no matter what.

745
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
The one thing I remember about how we get,

746
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
you remember when we're doing steel pier.

747
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
And then we're doing the one of the coldest points I had in my life.

748
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
You know, they're a hose on the soft on that thing.

749
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And it felt like my damn hip flexors were going to pop off.

750
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
You're doing flutter kicks.

751
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Then they'd pop us in the ocean and the ocean had to been around 60 degrees.

752
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
But the ocean was way warmer than still.

753
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
So you're in there and you're like, oh man, this is great.

754
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Keep us in the ocean for a little longer.

755
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
You know, and they'd pop you back up there back and forth.

756
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And I could barely walk when we got off of that damn, that damn pier.

757
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So the peer evolution and how we was was horrible.

758
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And then the instructors just wrenching down on that rope.

759
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Carrying the boats to and from child that shit sucked.

760
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You mean wrenching down on the rope so that the thing is pulling down on your head on your head.

761
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Yes.

762
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Yeah, I thought my little neck was going to snap off there.

763
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Were they jumping from boat to boat when you were?

764
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
We had instructors in our boat.

765
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
I don't remember if jumping to another boat, but we were carrying them around.

766
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
The structures were jumping from boat to boat.

767
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Damn.

768
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
And like I remember here in my freaking neck bones just grinding.

769
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Yep.

770
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
No, I was like, this doesn't seem like it's good for me.

771
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
But, well.

772
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah.

773
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
So honor man and fire in the gut guy.

774
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And of course you jack into team five and known cares about any of that.

775
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
No, it cares.

776
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Like, hey, new guy.

777
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Grab, go clean the shitter.

778
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
He's like, damn, I thought I got away from the shitter.

779
00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
You're following me everywhere.

780
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
I jacked into team five.

781
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Yep.

782
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Chugging into team five and August 1994.

783
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And then back then, you know, we started to go through STT.

784
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
So they pop you in a pitoon and you start doing your pitoon work up.

785
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
But you also got to detach from your pitoon and go through a seal tax.

786
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Oh, no kid.

787
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
So you're okay.

788
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
So, but your pitoon work up started.

789
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Our pitoon work up.

790
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
We, it was almost, we were a couple months before starting the work up.

791
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
But we were broken off and going to STT and the pitoon had just started some things when we had finished up.

792
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
And you went to the group STT didn't you?

793
00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
No team.

794
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I think, you know, it's just the team.

795
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Just to your team.

796
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Okay.

797
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
I thought they had already combined because eventually they combined.

798
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Yep.

799
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Where every guy went directly to a group.

800
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Well, not directly, but everyone went through STT together for a while.

801
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
They still do now, but there was a time when they started.

802
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
I thought they started around that time.

803
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
So with you, is just guys from team five?

804
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Yep.

805
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Was it run by team five?

806
00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
It was run by team five.

807
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I'm trying to get out.

808
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000
That's the same thing that I did.

809
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
And, and did you have any idea what your job was going to be?

810
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
No.

811
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I got, you know, putting them at tune initially.

812
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
I was a, a dub guy in there.

813
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
I worked in there.

814
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
The problem I had with a dub is I was left handed.

815
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
And we did one of our guys in training.

816
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And he's like, hey, man, you're, they do to left handed.

817
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Why do you guys have a shooting in a dub?

818
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Because you know, I all that rounds are the brass and the link.

819
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Yeah, link are going out to the right, which is going right across your field of fire and then your face and stuff.

820
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
So like, hey, put them on rear security.

821
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
So, got on rear security for that first battoon.

822
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
And then worked in there, dabble around and first attend it and ordinance.

823
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
What kind of platoon was it just a spec ops?

824
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Speaks back off, spoutin.

825
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yep.

826
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Yep.

827
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
So we were deploying out to a little island out there on the Pacific.

828
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Did you, uh, how was, how was like your platoon leadership?

829
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
No.

830
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
The first battoon was not, was not good.

831
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
So I got to see what wrong looks like.

832
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
You know, and it was kind of funny.

833
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Like our, uh, was a classic case of, you know, our, our OIC was, it was a good dude.

834
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
But I think it was two smart birds.

835
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
I don't get it.

836
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And he, he was a little more concerned with PT and being a good shape.

837
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And he was a phenomenal athlete.

838
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Like, you know, one of them triathletes guys.

839
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Mm-hmm.

840
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
But it came at the cost of showing up to dive evolutions on time.

841
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Came at the cost of being a good tactical leader down on the ground, which is what everyone's,

842
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
104.

843
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Um, so I think he kind of lost, you know, a lot of our guys respect.

844
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And he was kind of hardheaded, you know, and that classic,

845
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
you know, I'm smart and everyone else type thing.

846
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
So it didn't go over good.

847
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
And it, it was just a, it was weird, you know, it was weird.

848
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And I didn't realize how, you know, trying to find a good way to wear this.

849
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
It wasn't an ideal patoon.

850
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
You don't realize that until you get into a really good patoon.

851
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Yeah, for you, you didn't know anything different.

852
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Of course, so for you, that's just the way a patoon was.

853
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Yep.

854
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
And the scary thing about that is you get such a big impression made on you by your first

855
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
patoon, that if you're not careful, you can think that other

856
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
patoons are jacked up because they're not like your first patoon.

857
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Yeah.

858
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You know, you're so impressionable.

859
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

860
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Yeah.

861
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
So it was, it was an arresting.

862
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
So there was a huge difference between my first patoon and third

863
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
patoon, my third patoon I did.

864
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
We were like the best patoon of the team.

865
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
And it felt good.

866
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Like the leadership was dialed in.

867
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000
They were balanced out.

868
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Harpatoon chief was squared away.

869
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Well, respect it.

870
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
He was good.

871
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Tactically he was good administrative.

872
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
That's the dude I want to be like.

873
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
You know, that was in your third patoon.

874
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
That was my third patoon.

875
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
You know, my second patoon was better than my first.

876
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Still a lot of room for improvement.

877
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
You know, we, you were security.

878
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Did you move a to point manner?

879
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Yeah.

880
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Yeah.

881
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Move up to a point manner at some point.

882
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
I think my second patoon, the third patoon, I was running a point.

883
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Running a point.

884
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Your tall for a point.

885
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I know.

886
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
How tall are you?

887
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Yeah.

888
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Six two.

889
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Yeah.

890
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And what were you, you know, just to give people a reminder, this is the 90s.

891
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
So we don't have a lot of assets.

892
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Nope.

893
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
We don't have a lot of money.

894
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Nope.

895
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
We don't have.

896
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
We're not really doing any real missions.

897
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Barely.

898
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
No.

899
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
You know, some guys like Gardner went to Somalia.

900
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
But that was a real rare occurrence.

901
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Yeah.

902
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
So what we would do is train.

903
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Get ready.

904
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Go on to point.

905
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Kind of party.

906
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Just kind of like what the scene was.

907
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Yeah.

908
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I was kind of funny because when I showed up to the team, Gardner was already in there.

909
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
He already had a couple of pothones on his bone.

910
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I'm on the damn quarter deck watch.

911
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And this dude has a long maybe he's still in.

912
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
So I won't say his name.

913
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
But he had a long name.

914
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And I'm like tension in the team five compound.

915
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Someone's so, you know, reports of the quarter deck.

916
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
And I've put your name.

917
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
What do you think's calling me on the damn before you go Gardner?

918
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
He was a hard case man.

919
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Hey, you have to new guy.

920
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Say his name right.

921
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
That's a shit man.

922
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
That's a friend.

923
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Yeah.

924
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
You're Gardner everything?

925
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Yeah.

926
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
He was.

927
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
I was like damn I'm not getting out of the compound tonight.

928
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
We don't get taped up and thrown in a damn mil van.

929
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yeah.

930
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
So, so this was ninety.

931
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Yeah.

932
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Because at that time.

933
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Actually, yeah.

934
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
At those years, you were starting to get a migration to team five from, like, for instance, from team one.

935
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
If people wanted to leave team one, if they didn't like the stall log.

936
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
And so there's a whole gang of guys that went down to team five.

937
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I remember that to just get to have some freedom.

938
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
No fun one.

939
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah.

940
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
They're all right down the street up.

941
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
They were coming on down the street north.

942
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Gardner was always at team five.

943
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
So he was, but he was just like, why would I want more, like,

944
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Why would I want to be over there with as a bunch of rules that you have to

945
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
fought with?

946
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Yeah.

947
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
You can always find Gardner out when you're doing work into the desert.

948
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Because you just look for some smoke and look for fire.

949
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Look for fire.

950
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
There's Gardner.

951
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
He's a lights up shit on fire.

952
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Gardner got.

953
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
So you do your third puttune.

954
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And then what?

955
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
What are you thinking?

956
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
What are you thinking about your life at that point?

957
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
So what?

958
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
What year is it?

959
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
So this is I finished my third puttune in 99.

960
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
So I was going through a divorce at a kid and I was like, hey, I got to hit the

961
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
reset button.

962
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
So I talked to our master.

963
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
I see him saying, I was like, hey, man, I can't even get you in here.

964
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Be the training cell LPO and I was like, hey, man, I got a lot of baggage right now.

965
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
I need to break contact here, go reset.

966
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
So I got orders over to our special boat team and the headquarters element.

967
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And I got put in there training cell.

968
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
We were basically setting up operational readiness exercises just like we used to

969
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
run.

970
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Yep.

971
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And so you went just to everyone understands you went from instead of being a team training cell,

972
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
which you're going to be gone all the time doing training trips.

973
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
You go to a boat training and then the O.R.E.

974
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Training.

975
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
So you're going to be home a lot more.

976
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Yes.

977
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Yep.

978
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
And so at that point, I was ready to go back to school.

979
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
So as soon as I got there, I was already enrolled back in college on a cup.

980
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
A one year.

981
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
I don't know what you call, but you know, they have military program.

982
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
So I was going to school Saturday and Sunday.

983
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
They're not out on my upper level units from my bachelor's

984
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
degree and then I was working on my lower level units at the same time.

985
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
So I wanted to finish up my degree in about three years.

986
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And so I'm there going through the training.

987
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
We're home away trips every now and then every now and again.

988
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And it was good man.

989
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I had good leadership in there.

990
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
You know, the special warfare combat and craft crewmen.

991
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Them dudes are square the way.

992
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
And so I got to learn a lot about the boats.

993
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
And that play off.

994
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Or it helped me out later on because you really learned in, you know,

995
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
a how far can these things go load capacity.

996
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
All those key tactical things that matter when it comes into a mission planning process

997
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
for training or for a mission.

998
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Yeah.

999
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
And what's good is you start to relate those to helicopters and aircraft and vehicles.

1000
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
And so it gives you a better sense because as a young team got,

1001
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I was really lucky.

1002
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I was a communicator.

1003
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I was a company guy.

1004
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
So I was always involved in the planning.

1005
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
More than my peers.

1006
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Right.

1007
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
And the point man might plan the the end, you know, the route.

1008
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
But like I was like, okay, here's what we're going to,

1009
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
here's what we're going to do for communications during the insert.

1010
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
And then once we're on target.

1011
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
So I was more involved in the planning, which was super lucky.

1012
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And then I did Args where I was working with the Marine Corps and working with the big Navy.

1013
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
So once again, what's the distance that this helicopter can take us to and

1014
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
serve us?

1015
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
What's the distance that we can get with our boats?

1016
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
What's the distance that our ribs?

1017
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Once again, the boats, how far can they take us?

1018
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.000
So I was very lucky that I got that opportunity because once you realize how to plan with assets,

1019
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
it's a big, you can transfers to all different assets.

1020
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
It makes you, makes you smarter across the board.

1021
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Yep.

1022
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
So all that was good.

1023
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
So in, while was there at the boat at the boat dead, I was like,

1024
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
a not much going on in the 90s.

1025
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I was kind of like ready to punch out of the military.

1026
00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And so I started putting him application for the CHP California Highway Patrol.

1027
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Went through all the interview process, all the testing, got my letter of acceptance.

1028
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
And I was kind of just on standby.

1029
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
I was going to transition out.

1030
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
And then August of that year in 2001, I made Chief.

1031
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
I don't know how that one made Chief that.

1032
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
You know, I wasn't expecting to put it on.

1033
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
It was like a total shocker, you know.

1034
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
And then in September 2001, 9.11, I was at Garret Shed.

1035
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
I'm staying in.

1036
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Man, we've been waiting a long time to get in the base.

1037
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I've been training for whatever.

1038
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
I've been seven years.

1039
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Yeah, I was like, yep.

1040
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So, you know, from there, I worked with the CMC over team five.

1041
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
You get back there and he's like, I got a potato chip slot open.

1042
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
If you want him, I was like, hell yeah.

1043
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
You rolled right into a platoon chief slot.

1044
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Yep.

1045
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000
After September 11th.

1046
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Yes.

1047
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
So I went back to the team.

1048
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
I left like a few months early, TAD to go back to team five until my orders could catch up.

1049
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And then got over there and like I think right around January, February timeframe.

1050
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
We started forming up our battalion, getting ready for a 12 month workup.

1051
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
So you called the CMC at team five.

1052
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Yep.

1053
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And today, bro.

1054
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Yeah, I wouldn't say I was saying, hey, bro.

1055
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
But I got the other match you've had with me at the boat debt.

1056
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
He was my second platoon chief.

1057
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
And he's like, hey, I'm working with Jimmy over here.

1058
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Team five.

1059
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
You want to, you got a spot open.

1060
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
You want to.

1061
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
I was like, hell yeah, I want it.

1062
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Dude, my point is like.

1063
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:21.000
It man, build some good relationships with people.

1064
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Yeah.

1065
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Build some good relationships with people.

1066
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Yeah.

1067
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Because that pays off.

1068
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Yeah.

1069
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
That means you, how do you build good relationships?

1070
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Not by kissing ass by working hard by doing a good job.

1071
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
That's how you build good relationships.

1072
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
When I checked into team seven after September 11th is actually like whatever

1073
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Two years after September 11th.

1074
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:46.000
My, the CEO there, which first of all, the detailer who I was friends with,

1075
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
sent me to the next deploying team.

1076
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
So when I left, I had to go to college for a CMC animal program.

1077
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
When I left college, I went to the next deploying team.

1078
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Yeah.

1079
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
That's not luck bro.

1080
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yeah.

1081
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And then when I got to the team, the command officer who I'd also work for in the past,

1082
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:13.000
fired a platoon commander and put me in as a platoon commander, whatever three months before

1083
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
deployment.

1084
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.000
That's just, you know, that's based on my past performance.

1085
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Yeah.

1086
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000
And relationships for sure, but relationships are built on the fact that I worked hard

1087
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
and was trustworthy to get the job done.

1088
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Yeah.

1089
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
So you never, plus you just never know who you're going to be working with.

1090
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
No.

1091
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
You know, don't burn any bridges, man.

1092
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
Don't burn any bridges.

1093
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Yeah.

1094
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And just go back to what you're saying there that your credibility in the teams is everything.

1095
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Your reputation.

1096
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Yeah.

1097
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And you don't want to have a reputation of being a, you know, a jackass.

1098
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
You're a jackass.

1099
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Yeah.

1100
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
You're a cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

1101
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
You don't want to be that.

1102
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

1103
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
And the reputation is, is a, I don't know what the word to describe it.

1104
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
It is a heavy thing that sticks with you.

1105
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
It's actually, it's a sticky thing.

1106
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
It's a sticky thing.

1107
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And if you have good reputation, it'll stick with you.

1108
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
If you have a bad reputation, it'll stick with you.

1109
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
It can take people years to overturn a bad reputation.

1110
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Yeah.

1111
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
And interestingly, it can also take people years to ruin a good reputation.

1112
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Yeah.

1113
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Like a person with a good reputation can make mistakes and people like all you

1114
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
get.

1115
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
I don't worry about it's friend.

1116
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
You know, it's good to go.

1117
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Or a person with a bad reputation can make one little slip up and people like you got to be

1118
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
kidding me.

1119
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
We need to get rid of this guy.

1120
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Pull us, try to get him out.

1121
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Yeah.

1122
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Yeah.

1123
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
I like, and I hate to say that because right, right, that's like, that's like, what?

1124
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
That's like political and all this stuff.

1125
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
But it's just the reality, the situation.

1126
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
And there's, there's a reason for that.

1127
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Because a look, human beings are going to mess up.

1128
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
But if you, I guess the difference is you have a good, a good person with a good reputation.

1129
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
They earn that reputation by consistent good performance.

1130
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Yeah.

1131
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
And eventually that reputation stands on its own.

1132
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:05.000
And therefore, if they make a mistake, which everyone's going to make mistakes, when they make a mistake, when they make a mistake, which they will, people go, oh, you know, like, guess what?

1133
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
You know what?

1134
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
They've done a hundred good things.

1135
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
That's how they built that reputation.

1136
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Now here comes a bad one.

1137
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
All right.

1138
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Well, we're carry on.

1139
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Whereas, if you've done a bunch of bad things.

1140
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
And now you do something bad.

1141
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
You're good.

1142
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
You don't have any leg to stand on.

1143
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Yep.

1144
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Yep.

1145
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
You're screwed.

1146
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
So that reputation thing.

1147
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
And it's everywhere.

1148
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
It's everywhere, but man in the teams, it's a big thing.

1149
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
It's a big thing.

1150
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
It's damn near everything.

1151
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
It's damn near everything.

1152
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
It's damn near everything.

1153
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
You're rep.

1154
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
So you roll in.

1155
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Now you're a political, a political chief at team five.

1156
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Yep.

1157
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Get ready to deploy.

1158
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Yes.

1159
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Yep.

1160
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
But at what point do you realize you guys are going to Iraq?

1161
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
We didn't know until probably January 2003.

1162
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
So we're, you know, I get there in October 2001.

1163
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
January February 2002.

1164
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
We started our 12 month long work up cycle.

1165
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
And then it's going through and it looks like we're going into Iraq.

1166
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You know, we no one really understood the scale of that thing.

1167
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
How big it would wind up being.

1168
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
How many years it wind up being, you know?

1169
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000
So when they told us how you're going over,

1170
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
we were like hell.

1171
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Yeah.

1172
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Yeah.

1173
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
This is awesome.

1174
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Because you, like everybody else in the teams,

1175
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
was worried that there would be a three month war and you'd miss the whole thing.

1176
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Exactly.

1177
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Exactly.

1178
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Which is so hard to explain to people, especially now that we've been a war for almost 20 years straight.

1179
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Yeah.

1180
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
It's hard to explain to people how much it meant to go to war when there was no war going on.

1181
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Yeah.

1182
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
It was everything.

1183
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Like you were just like, man, this is going to be awesome.

1184
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
You know, it's getting prep.

1185
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
You know, like, I don't know what to expect.

1186
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Everyone was thinking they had chemical weapons.

1187
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
You know, we were going through all kinds of mob drills with our CBR gear and just going through everything.

1188
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Are you with you guys were getting everyone tuned up so we were dialed in.

1189
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Then you're looking at the freaking mob uniforms.

1190
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Yeah.

1191
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
And it's like got a elastic drawstring at the waist and like you're thinking,

1192
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Wait a second.

1193
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Yep.

1194
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
This is supposed to keep me alive and happen.

1195
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Whatever.

1196
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Let's rock and roll.

1197
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Did you ever think that you ever take that charcoal freaking light laden suit and be like,

1198
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Hey, how would it wait?

1199
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
You're saying this thing's going to save me?

1200
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
It's got some elastic drawstring around the ankles and that's supposed to keep me good to go.

1201
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Yeah.

1202
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
That that mob suit didn't have a good reputation.

1203
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Do you?

1204
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Sure.

1205
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
It was it was lacking.

1206
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
I don't know what the US government paid for those mob suits.

1207
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.000
And what level of security they provided us,

1208
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
but I don't have a lot of confidence.

1209
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
The idea was a lot.

1210
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
And the gas masks do like one of the chances.

1211
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Yep.

1212
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
But that's where we were getting told we were going to do.

1213
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
And not one single guy said, no, because we did.

1214
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I did one.

1215
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Up where we mopped up because we thought we were hitting a target that had allegedly.

1216
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Some whatever chemical weapons.

1217
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
And you know what everyone did.

1218
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Everyone got jocked up.

1219
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Everyone put those gas masks on.

1220
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Everyone put those stupid freaking uniforms on.

1221
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
And I'll tell you what we had quite a few missions when we got over to Iraq.

1222
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
What we were going around with some of those three letter agencies looking all over the place.

1223
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Seeing what was around.

1224
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
And everything we saw was was old.

1225
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:21.000
It was like it been there left.

1226
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
You know, nothing knew at all.

1227
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
You know, um,

1228
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
As far as CBR, CBR.

1229
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Yeah.

1230
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
She had like all the facilities and everything was like nothing's been here for a long ass time.

1231
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
So.

1232
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:37.000
So all right, well, let's, so you get them with your work up.

1233
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
You find out you're going to Iraq in January.

1234
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000
And you guys are going on deployment in like April or something.

1235
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Yep.

1236
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Yep.

1237
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
April timeframe.

1238
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
So a team three was already over there and just going back to your relationships.

1239
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Peace.

1240
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000
We had a couple guys on the battoons that were dialed in with some team three guys.

1241
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
And they started sharing information.

1242
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
You know, back and forth.

1243
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Hey, here's what's going on.

1244
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Here's what to expect.

1245
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
So that gave us a really good idea on what we needed to prep for.

1246
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.000
And so right around April timeframe, we deploy over to Kuwait and work stage in Kuwait,

1247
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Wait and go into Iraq.

1248
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Team three's, I think, wrapping things up at that point.

1249
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
We might already turned over with them.

1250
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Um, and we're actually in, um, Kuwait for a handful of weeks.

1251
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
I want to say right around three weeks.

1252
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000
And we actually did our first all about a Kuwait into Iraq on 53's.

1253
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Yeah.

1254
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:25.000
That was, that sounded like a crazy out.

1255
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
It was good.

1256
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
It was a good shake out.

1257
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Nothing, nothing happened.

1258
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000
But we planned for 96 hours.

1259
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
We went through all of our helicopter aerosols.

1260
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
You know, and it was a big, obliverted up those, uh, our D.P.V.

1261
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
He's Desmond Role vehicles.

1262
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
And we went in with a big package.

1263
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And we, what was your mission?

1264
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
To go take down the, the dam.

1265
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Get control.

1266
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Control.

1267
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000
He did.

1268
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
It wasn't a deed.

1269
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
There was somewhere up north, the Mucorium.

1270
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Okay.

1271
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Mucorium dam.

1272
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
So, uh, we went up there.

1273
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
And it was a long ass flight in there.

1274
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
And we're all jacked up on the cat.

1275
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Now, you think you're going to get in the shit.

1276
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
You know, we're flying there.

1277
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.000
We got her.

1278
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000
He and our plan laid out.

1279
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Case of helicopter.

1280
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Get shot down.

1281
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:04.000
We got our mob gear with us.

1282
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Yeah.

1283
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
And we're roping down off 53's onto the dam.

1284
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
With our CBR gear, you look like, you know,

1285
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Mitchell and snowman.

1286
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Do you mask up when you, when you fast roped?

1287
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
We were not.

1288
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
The, the game plan was secure the dam.

1289
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Get everything set up.

1290
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Get everything cleared.

1291
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
And then they had some tunneling systems in there.

1292
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Because it was a dam.

1293
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
They wanted us to go inside the tunneling system.

1294
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
See if there's any, you know, weapons, a mass destruction or chemical weapons in there.

1295
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
So the, once we secure the dam, which took a little while,

1296
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
because you don't only think about how big a dam is on the inside.

1297
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
There's a lot of shit going on in there.

1298
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
This is a one-platoon up.

1299
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
This is, so we had like a bar.

1300
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
We had a two plus.

1301
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
We had a two plus.

1302
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
We had our, our mobility element.

1303
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
And we also brought in some, as TV brothers,

1304
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
which was good.

1305
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
They'd already been there.

1306
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
And they'd clear the tunnel ships small, you know,

1307
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
little, what do you call the little boats out there?

1308
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Dows.

1309
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Dows.

1310
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
They cleared a tunnel.

1311
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000
So these guys had already.

1312
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Had some reps on the boat.

1313
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
So we were excited to get them on the opposite.

1314
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
But yeah, we went in there, on the vent,

1315
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
filled clear to chuck the tunnels, nothing there.

1316
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Then we, you know, waited there a couple days.

1317
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
And then we pulled out.

1318
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
But that, that's a, that's like a big,

1319
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
that's the big mesh that we were planning for in the 90s.

1320
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Like that type of fig.

1321
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Yeah.

1322
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Like hey, here it is.

1323
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Yeah.

1324
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
You're going to heal a win.

1325
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
This is the big mesh.

1326
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
And plus, that was your first combat operation.

1327
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Yes.

1328
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Yep.

1329
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
It was a big deal.

1330
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:25.000
We felt good to get that under our belt.

1331
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.000
And we, we, it was a good shake out for planning.

1332
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Because, you know, you're either going through the 96 hour planning cycle.

1333
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Um, a lot of good lessons learned.

1334
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
First time using 53 is on an automation like that.

1335
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
So it was good.

1336
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
You know, in one of the things I jacked up is me and another guy on our medical guy's

1337
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
squad, the way to stay in the teams for a while.

1338
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
But we rope down.

1339
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
And we had our CBR gear strapped on our sides.

1340
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
And so it was we're coming down.

1341
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
We got that damn molly pack.

1342
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000
You know, you got a weave it in and out of the, the nylon.

1343
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
I didn't weave mine in and out like I was supposed to.

1344
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
So I went through a couple, but I left like the bottom on done.

1345
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
And I don't know if I hit the wheel or the skin of the aircraft, but that thing, that damn thing

1346
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
came popping off.

1347
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Of course, I had my MVGs in there.

1348
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Ooh, the heel, you know, and the, uh, the backpack goes over the side.

1349
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Same thing with the other cat that was with me.

1350
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
We think the world of wash, you know, put it in the river and stuff.

1351
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
And everybody was talking about, hey, it's not a big deal.

1352
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
You can, you get, you know, right it off as a combat.

1353
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000
It's a combat loss.

1354
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
That's what everyone was talking about.

1355
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
You know, like, all right, I guess it's not the big video.

1356
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Calm about last.

1357
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I was like, do the skipper was not happy.

1358
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:36.000
The combat loss right off was not a thing.

1359
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Yeah.

1360
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Well, what's really not a thing is trying to do a night clearance without nods.

1361
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Yeah, night vision.

1362
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
We white lighted everything then.

1363
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Okay.

1364
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
So back then, we're coming up on the damn we're white lighten it.

1365
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
And then even the clearance on the inside.

1366
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
So you were lucky.

1367
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
In that respect.

1368
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
What do you mean?

1369
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
I'd say it if you, you said you lost your nods, right?

1370
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Oh, yeah.

1371
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Yeah.

1372
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'm saying you're lucky that you didn't, you didn't need them.

1373
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

1374
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah.

1375
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yes.

1376
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
That is accurate.

1377
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Because that would have freaking, you'd have just been blind to walking around.

1378
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah.

1379
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah.

1380
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Walk into a wall.

1381
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Yeah.

1382
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
It was just buddy along with somebody.

1383
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Yeah.

1384
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It was a good lesson for me.

1385
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Did you, uh, that little Molly weave?

1386
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
How many Molly weaves did you make?

1387
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Like two?

1388
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I think I had about three in there.

1389
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I think there was around five.

1390
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And I just left out the last two and snap that end.

1391
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Snap that end.

1392
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Snap that end.

1393
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Yeah.

1394
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Snap that end.

1395
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Get her done.

1396
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
She's good.

1397
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Not so good.

1398
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Yeah.

1399
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
How did you get such a good one?

1400
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
And the skipper was pissed.

1401
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Oh, he was hot.

1402
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And I was on the mat with him.

1403
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Like he's, you know, called me to task all that way.

1404
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Yeah.

1405
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Luckily, like I said, you had a good reputation.

1406
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Like if you had a bad reputation at that point, that would really suck.

1407
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah.

1408
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yeah.

1409
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Would have really sucked.

1410
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Yep.

1411
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
So that was your first big mesh.

1412
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And then what?

1413
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But that was out of Kuwait.

1414
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
That was out of Kuwait.

1415
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yep.

1416
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
And then what happened?

1417
01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Then we moved up into Baghdad.

1418
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
We had a little camp set up out there.

1419
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I'd call camp pose.

1420
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You know, we had a, I don't know if you know,

1421
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
opposed you, but it could go more and more on serving.

1422
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And I'm doing good.

1423
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Good scores.

1424
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Good scores.

1425
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And the best.

1426
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And we had another guy we called him Ranger.

1427
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And, uh, those two dudes came in.

1428
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
And we were going to build out the camp.

1429
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
You know, we took a Ranger with us on, uh,

1430
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
on the fight a few missions.

1431
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Good dude.

1432
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
And then we just started operating out of Posey into Baghdad.

1433
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Yeah.

1434
01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
We were right there at the Baghdad International Airport.

1435
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And what I was impressed with looking back,

1436
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
or what I am impressed with at looking back is,

1437
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.000
you guys were freaking super proactive in getting missions started.

1438
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Like you guys were super proactive in forming relationships.

1439
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yep.

1440
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And getting me and tell that you needed from various sources.

1441
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And, and starting to do a lot of operations.

1442
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Yeah.

1443
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
We set the foundation for you guys.

1444
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah.

1445
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah.

1446
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah.

1447
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
As came in it did like four times more than what we did.

1448
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But we were definitely in laying that foundation.

1449
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And one of the things we had our task unit senior enlisted leader.

1450
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Um, he was dialed in and he came from Damnet.

1451
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Mm-hmm.

1452
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
And so he had a lot of good relationships.

1453
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Yeah.

1454
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You know, you know,

1455
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Damnet was over there at that point.

1456
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And so he was tied in with a lot of the three letter agencies,

1457
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
which opened up the door with quite a few missions,

1458
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
shared intelligence.

1459
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
So that really helped set that foundation for us.

1460
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And then from there we were starting to get,

1461
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
you know, some good missions.

1462
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And hell even if you're getting one mission, you're like,

1463
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
all right, we're good to go, you know,

1464
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
because you think we all think we're going to be out of there with then six, seven months.

1465
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Like the whole thing shutting down.

1466
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Yep.

1467
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Um, but obviously it didn't.

1468
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Yeah.

1469
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So, what was your, you guys got in some gun fights, too?

1470
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Yeah.

1471
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
What was the first one like, what do you remember?

1472
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Our first shoot I was kind of funny.

1473
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We were dialing in our standard operating procedures for a shootout.

1474
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Um, which we had done.

1475
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Like, you know, we went through training training was good,

1476
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
but it was nowhere near the level that, you know,

1477
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
we provided our guys once we got over to trade it.

1478
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Wasn't anywhere near that.

1479
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So we identified a few of the gaps we had.

1480
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And we went, we developed, we brought on the batoon,

1481
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
we brought in guys with experience.

1482
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And we developed our standard operating procedure for what we're going to do

1483
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
inside a house if we get in a shootout.

1484
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
And it was basically a press fire cover crash maneuver using a cover move

1485
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
and we're going to deploy some crashes.

1486
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
So, what's going to be, it's a press and fire while that's happening.

1487
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So, on this particular mission, we went in and, uh,

1488
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
the house, the guy Mark Force was the wrong house.

1489
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
We didn't know that.

1490
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
We want imagery, everything looked down, then tight,

1491
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
and they market.

1492
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It looks good.

1493
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
We go in.

1494
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Breach the door.

1495
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So we gone exposed.

1496
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
So now the neighborhood started to wake up.

1497
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
We clear the house.

1498
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I kept everything on the clock.

1499
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
We clear the, you know, two story house in under two minutes.

1500
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
We get the call on the net a reset.

1501
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The actual target house is down the street.

1502
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
So we reset, we consolidate, you know,

1503
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
ones on the left, two is on the right, gear check,

1504
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
you know, sensitive equipment check.

1505
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Everyone's good.

1506
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Come back out of the house, grab our wood ladders,

1507
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
patrol back down the road and the right house is marked.

1508
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
And we go up there.

1509
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And it was the right house.

1510
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It had a double security screen door.

1511
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
We go to close up on it.

1512
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
We got a, a fail breach.

1513
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
So now it's turned into a big construction project.

1514
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
The guys were up and nothing mentioned it just so everybody knows like after you

1515
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000
hit the first house, everybody in a two mile square radius knows what's happening.

1516
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And if you're in that neighborhood, you know exactly what's happening.

1517
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
So if you're a bad guy in that neighborhood,

1518
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
you are now alert and ready to be attacked and you're prepping.

1519
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Yep.

1520
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Exactly.

1521
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
So now we got to fail breach.

1522
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
We're on the outside of the structure.

1523
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
The preachers are working through getting through that heavy security screen door.

1524
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
We're kind of raken windows.

1525
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
We're deploying crashes in there to keep people away from the front door.

1526
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
We finally get entry clear the first floor.

1527
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Everything's good.

1528
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
We're dialed in and back then we always pressed into our guys.

1529
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Hey, you make the call.

1530
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
If you stack on the stairs, you're the number two guy.

1531
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
You got three or four more guys behind you.

1532
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Make the call and go up the stairs.

1533
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
We don't want to just have this lag period where you're waiting for.

1534
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Me or the OIC to make a decision.

1535
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Tell you what to do.

1536
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Decentralized command.

1537
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
So the guy stack on the stairs.

1538
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'm right there.

1539
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I just came out of the kitchen area.

1540
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They start moving up the stairs and there's young kid upstairs with an AK 47.

1541
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So he's like 10 feet away and he's just full auto.

1542
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Guy's, our guys are on the stairs.

1543
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
They're trying to return fire.

1544
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But the, the volume's just all around our dudes, man.

1545
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm young in the guys get back down here.

1546
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
They come back down the stairs.

1547
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And then we go through our shootout procedures, which, which paid dividends.

1548
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
They worked.

1549
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
We couldn't shoot get at the guy because the guys on the second deck are now working down the loan.

1550
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So there's no way to get the direct fire.

1551
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
So our guys are exposing themselves a little bit trying to get an angle here.

1552
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Guys are deploying crashes.

1553
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
We deployed about five, six crashes.

1554
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
There's no more gunfire.

1555
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
We're like, all right, check.

1556
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
We're going up.

1557
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
So, you know, we go up the stairs.

1558
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
The kid had actually dropped his gun.

1559
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
We clear the second deck.

1560
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
There's freaking smoke everywhere.

1561
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So he's just, I mean, we're gagging.

1562
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
There's so much smoke in the house.

1563
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Go up there.

1564
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
The guy's not there.

1565
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
We're like, where the hell this guy go?

1566
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
And our guys go out on the deck patio.

1567
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And they're clearing.

1568
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And now we're looking really hard.

1569
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Like, where is this guy?

1570
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And the kid is a young kid hiding behind curtains.

1571
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
And, you know, the guy's there.

1572
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And then boom, our guys, Mosul Strike the guy.

1573
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Get him into the center room.

1574
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
We cuff him up.

1575
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And that was that.

1576
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So, they didn't want to get hit by him by the bad guy.

1577
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
And also these, you know, our, our guy had enough of the stairs.

1578
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
First, the first guy up, he had a graze over his NVGs.

1579
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
But actually, he had his, his mount.

1580
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
But he didn't get hit.

1581
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It was like, it was a total pulp fiction pulp fiction.

1582
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
And then boom, boom, boom.

1583
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yeah.

1584
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Like he had angels on his.

1585
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Because I could have been a bad guy.

1586
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
And I would get a two, three guys hit in that one ball.

1587
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And no one got hit.

1588
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
We, we were extremely lucky.

1589
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
How many, how many rounds do you think the guy shot one mag or two mags?

1590
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Did he get a reload?

1591
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
No, no, no, he didn't get a reload.

1592
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I think you got a full mag off somewhere in between 25 and 30 rounds.

1593
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Damn dude.

1594
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Yeah.

1595
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
From 10 feet.

1596
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Yeah.

1597
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yep.

1598
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Close.

1599
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Yeah.

1600
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I mean, I don't know how he probably missed because he was on full auto.

1601
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
You know, those things get, you're just bouncing all around and going full auto.

1602
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
And the dude, you know, the guy was just a total douche bag of shot as two.

1603
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
He was like, I love towards push.

1604
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I love Coca-Cola.

1605
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And you're like, you should shut up, man.

1606
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
So yeah, we cuffed him up.

1607
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And that was, that was emotional when you're getting shot at that close and you're dealing with the bad dude that just tried to kill you.

1608
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
You know, those emotions get jacked up pretty high.

1609
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Um, we had some good teammates there.

1610
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I mean, I was, I wanted to kill the dude.

1611
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Um, but you can't do that, you know, as much as you want to.

1612
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
You're gonna, it's not gonna be good.

1613
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But we got him cuffed up, took him over to our attention facility and, you know, the guys did good that night.

1614
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And they did good because of the training, the talk throughs that we did.

1615
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Going through the checklist, going through multiple rehearsals.

1616
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Every time these missions came up, all that paned out, all that worked in our favor.

1617
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000
For that one event, for that one shoot out, that all worked for us.

1618
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
You know, having, uh, having contingency plans, which is that what you guys had.

1619
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
And it's what, you know, we have all kinds of contingency plans.

1620
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I mean, every eye add, every immediate interaction truly we do is a contingency plan.

1621
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Like, oh, if we could shot that from over there, we're gonna, we're gonna do.

1622
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:09.000
So having those contingency plans, it just makes it so that you don't really have to think.

1623
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Decentralized command just works.

1624
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Everyone knows what to do.

1625
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
They know what the objective is.

1626
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They make it happen.

1627
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And so you can make very little call, very very, you can give a very little direction.

1628
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And things still will proceed the way they're supposed to.

1629
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yeah.

1630
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What about, um, what about your next, what about your next gunfight?

1631
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So our next one, I think, was our, our helicopter.

1632
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
So we've gone in after this guy and he, um, he shot an RPG and killed an army guy.

1633
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And so we were going in after him.

1634
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And so we came in, we did quite a bit of heel work that deployment.

1635
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000
So we came in with our helicopters and our game plan was to, you know, land on the X assault the building and get grab a guy and go.

1636
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And he was out in this, uh, think we actually out in Feluso, Romani.

1637
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So there were some palm grows out there.

1638
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
So on insertion, we come in in the helicopters went to the wrong house.

1639
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
You know, our RPGs back then, they're kind of, they're not good.

1640
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So we could see how that.

1641
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
So we, we, we sat down or like, this is not the right house.

1642
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Get back up.

1643
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
They get back up, they get back up, do one orbit, come back into the right house.

1644
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Land us.

1645
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
We dump off, clear the building, everything's on a bit of a, we get the bad guy.

1646
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Now as we're going through all the, uh, sensitive side exploitation, we're trying to grab as much as we can on this guy.

1647
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:29.000
You know, we get a report as we're breaking out that hey, there's two or three armed guys coming your way through this palm grove.

1648
01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So the helicopters were, a ways out, but we had a gun chip overhead.

1649
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And so we set up a quick hasty perimeter, little fushook and we're going to wait to see if these guys came into us.

1650
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Well, they never came into us.

1651
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
They sent something was wrong and they bagged out.

1652
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
So we get set up in the palm grove and we're calling in the helicopters at this point to come pick us up.

1653
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And as we're setting up the perimeter, you know, someone calls out over the radio.

1654
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Hey, man, there's a tracer father just won by.

1655
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And no one else had seen us.

1656
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
One dude paying attention in his field of fire.

1657
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
She's one round come in.

1658
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And so we calls it out.

1659
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
So we kind of go on hyper alert here.

1660
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
We're waiting for watching and as the heroes are coming in this dude, they were probably like 300 yards from us.

1661
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
They start opening up with triple a fire over our LZ.

1662
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Now the only thing protect us at that time is we had a palm grove.

1663
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And the LZ's here in the house is somewhere over here.

1664
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
So this tracer fire is coming over the palm grove.

1665
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And the issue we had is like communicating this back up the chain.

1666
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
We had our tashkin to command around the ground with us on this one.

1667
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And some people just didn't see this shit.

1668
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Some people didn't see the tracer fire coming.

1669
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And I picked it up pretty damn quick once the guy called it out.

1670
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
And you know, I call you shit.

1671
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That's a good volley of fire.

1672
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
We're going to get a helicopter shot down in front of our car.

1673
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
So anyways, the helicopter comes in, picks up the package, grabs our headquarters on the bay bounce out.

1674
01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And then we just go over to our secondary LZ, which was pretty easy.

1675
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But it was very uncomfortable known that you got triple a fire coming over the top of you.

1676
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
You know, when he said he looks get shot down, this is going to be a long night,

1677
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
especially out here in this rural area.

1678
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
We didn't have to be back up.

1679
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And then what was your up tempo like?

1680
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
It wasn't bad.

1681
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
It wasn't like we were going out, taking a target every night.

1682
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
But we would, we got a point there where we were going out at least twice a week.

1683
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'd say once or twice a week.

1684
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
And more like twice a week.

1685
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But in between that, we were doing other stuff.

1686
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Yeah, mobility stuff.

1687
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000
We're going to do a little bit of sniper stuff here and there.

1688
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Which was, which was good.

1689
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
And then just going back on decentralized command, you know,

1690
01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
the other CQC or close court combat sheet,

1691
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
we had, you know, our guys were going up to this house.

1692
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And man, there's freaking telephone wires everywhere.

1693
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
And you know how that is.

1694
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You're like, there's no rhyme or reason why.

1695
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
How do you guys live with this?

1696
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
There's wires wires everywhere.

1697
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
You know, we got to hop over this damn gate, you know, to get to this house.

1698
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
So we literally like 30 or 40 wires like you could be just total mayhem wires.

1699
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Yep.

1700
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And we plan for.

1701
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
We actually picked it up on the energy.

1702
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
We're going through our rehearsals and we're like, hey, there's wires everywhere.

1703
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
It's your coming over.

1704
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
It's this spot right here.

1705
01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Be careful.

1706
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Don't get your nods.

1707
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Hit on them.

1708
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Don't, you know, we got to be quiet.

1709
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So we start going up and over.

1710
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
We get the entry team over.

1711
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And actually, we had our full squad in the courtyard because the distance from the gate to the actual house was a lot.

1712
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
It was a big house.

1713
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
So we needed a soldiers up front.

1714
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So we get up front.

1715
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
And the, you know, the entry teams going through, you know,

1716
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
our breaches going through laying the charge on the door.

1717
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Going through all the procedures.

1718
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And the next thing you know, you get this whack bang bang bang doors around your coming through the door.

1719
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
And so, you know, our breacher, we borrowed him from another petone.

1720
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
He was dialed in good dude.

1721
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.000
You and Dave know.

1722
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
But so he's, he's laying the charge and he's using his cover right if he's in the center of the door.

1723
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
The dudes getting shot.

1724
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
No, what the 45 calipestal.

1725
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But he's off to the side using his covers like he's supposed to.

1726
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Set's the charge.

1727
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Our guys are the guys holding security.

1728
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
They go through our standard operating procedures.

1729
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
They're waking the windows.

1730
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
They're shooting in through the window to get the person away from it.

1731
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And they're dumping crashes and to keep the person away.

1732
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Kick them out away from the doorway.

1733
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So boom, we blow it.

1734
01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Of course, it's a propane tank there.

1735
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
So the whole damn doorway catches on fire.

1736
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
So now we can't, you know, we've got to fill breacher.

1737
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
We can't get into the doors open.

1738
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But there's just this massive propane fire going on.

1739
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So we got to go to our secondary door.

1740
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
You get over the secondary door.

1741
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And these dudes got a damn drop on her on there.

1742
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So we, you know, we need to took us forever to get a,

1743
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
it was a shit show.

1744
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
We get entry into the, into the doorway and there's like a family of eight people sleeping in there.

1745
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
And they're like, they're still sleeping.

1746
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Like, how is it possible?

1747
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
We just blew in your door.

1748
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
There's gunshots going on.

1749
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
You, or you all are still, like physically sleeping.

1750
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Like zombies, you know.

1751
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
So anyways, we got in there clear the building.

1752
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
That sounds so unbelievable if you haven't been into Iraq before.

1753
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Like, you can't explain things like that.

1754
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Yeah.

1755
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You can't, you can't explain things like that.

1756
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
To get an explosive breach of failed breach.

1757
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And then we got a huge shock.

1758
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
That's going off of fire and the team, the freaking family just racked out.

1759
01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yep.

1760
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
They racked out.

1761
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And there was zombies, man.

1762
01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
What did you ever catch the guy that was shooting through the door?

1763
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Yeah, it was, it was actually the, I think it was one of the guys wife shooting through there.

1764
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
She's like, hey, I thought you, thought you were looters.

1765
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
You're like, coming into Robert House.

1766
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I don't know.

1767
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Like, yeah, no, we're not looters, you know.

1768
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But anyways, we got that situation all squared away.

1769
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
That's a rough, that, that,

1770
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Well, when I say that's rough one, that's the kind of mission where things can go really sideways.

1771
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Like, if you start fracking that room, which you could easily do to say,

1772
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Hey, look, we just got shot at.

1773
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I'm throwing some frag grenades into this room.

1774
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.000
And actually, you know, you got a family eight person family that are getting blown apart by

1775
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Frag grenades because the woman was trying to defend her house from looters, which again,

1776
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
may sound like a crazy story.

1777
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And it could also be the absolute 100% truth.

1778
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.000
I don't know. I'm not going to try and, you know, replay the situation that you lived through.

1779
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But that could be legit.

1780
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Yeah.

1781
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And you have no idea that we're out there.

1782
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
And now to been, now to been horrible.

1783
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Yeah, I'm in a fracking nightmare.

1784
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Yep.

1785
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Yep.

1786
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Any other big missions that you guys did,

1787
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
did you guys do like some, some like, SA7 recovery hours?

1788
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1789
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So we, I forgot about that one.

1790
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So we were out, we went out there, you know, we're going with some other

1791
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
intel people out there and they're like, hey, we're going after some of this sensitive

1792
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
stuff here and we, you know, anyways.

1793
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
So we went and hit this farmhouse.

1794
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
We got good air coverage overhead of us.

1795
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
No one's there.

1796
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
The place is a ghost town.

1797
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
We start going through our sensitive side exploitation.

1798
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And man, it was like a gold mine.

1799
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You know, the, the perimeter around it was just this big huge cash.

1800
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
And so we found a truckload of, you know,

1801
01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.000
SA7 and SA14 missiles, the ton of RPGs,

1802
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
uh, rock about pelgrinades and launchers.

1803
01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And so thanks started getting a little spicy around the areas.

1804
01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
We're calling them a little bit of a fire support.

1805
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And we actually had to turn that over to an army unit who came in the next day during

1806
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
daylight and they started going through the field.

1807
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
And then I was like, right, I mean, it was like radio.

1808
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It was like enough shit to outfit a damn army.

1809
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
You know, um, so that was a, that was a good off, nothing happened.

1810
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But we found a lot of stuff.

1811
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So you know, you leave there feeling pretty good about it.

1812
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
And that, so that was a good, that was a freaking great deployment for you guys,

1813
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:11.000
especially in like, whatever, 2003, that, that deployment was pretty freaking epic.

1814
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Oh, man, we left there and we're like, where are the man?

1815
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
More and ever coming back here again.

1816
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yeah, because no one had, no one ever thought you'd be back there again.

1817
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
No, no, no, it was good.

1818
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And so the one thing we did that was really good with our patoon,

1819
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
that we learned from the team three guys when we,

1820
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
we relieved them as we shared information.

1821
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
You know, I was back with, you know,

1822
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
you're, you're brother there, team one, communicate everything I had back to him.

1823
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Here's what we're doing, here's what worked, here's what,

1824
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
here's what, here's what didn't work, here's some things to think about with mobility.

1825
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Mm-hmm.

1826
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
And you just try to share as much information as possible, you know.

1827
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Yeah.

1828
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
That way the next guys coming in, they know what to expect.

1829
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
And they can adjust training coming into high level, ready to rock and roll.

1830
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I know when you guys came in, you guys did, I don't know, four times, four, five times.

1831
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
I'm out of mission as we did for that deployment.

1832
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Yeah, well, you get, you guys were pushing a lot of information back to us.

1833
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I know you guys were feeding my Poutoon Chief.

1834
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
And my Poutoon Chief was already like a mobility kind of mobility dude.

1835
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
That's how he was just amped bro.

1836
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
We were doing freaking, uh,

1837
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
freaking tire change drills like NASCAR, like a pit crew.

1838
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I mean, it was just like it was on.

1839
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000
But here's the funny thing, we were on an ORE prior to that deployment.

1840
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.000
So like maybe three months before going on a deployment,

1841
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
we were on an ORE, we did our ORE ship board.

1842
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And we went and we were doing hydrographic reconnaissance of red beach up in Camp Pendleton.

1843
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
We've led live in Slate, dude.

1844
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Like it was the world hadn't caught up.

1845
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Yep, right?

1846
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
The world hadn't caught up yet.

1847
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And thank God, you know, like after that, we found some home v's.

1848
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
We borrowed home v's from like the C-B's or something.

1849
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And started running up running, you know, training ops down at like the old NTC,

1850
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
the old Naval Training Center where they had a bunch of old buildings that were all dilapidated.

1851
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
But we started running little ops in there with our, you know,

1852
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
and our task unit commander had actually been in Iraq on the push-ups.

1853
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
So he had some experience, our task unit SCA had also been in Iraq on the push-ups.

1854
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
So he had some experience, um, which was awesome, and they're both great guys.

1855
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
So we were, and we were just going off of the reports of how you guys were doing stuff.

1856
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
And we were just like, okay, this is what they're doing.

1857
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Cool, this is what we're going to do.

1858
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
This is what they did. This is how they rigged their vehicles. Okay.

1859
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
This is how we're going to rig our vehicles. So that's kind of what we did.

1860
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And then I know you and I did a turnover in that.

1861
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Was it, we did a like, ball rain, right?

1862
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yeah, ball rain, that's where I was at.

1863
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
We had a, put two left up there in a mobile, it almost left up there.

1864
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Yeah. We came back a few weeks early out of ball rain just because there was enough room to bring everyone in.

1865
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
So, yeah. So we sat down, did it awesome turnover with you guys with you and your OIC.

1866
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Yep. Who's up for a great dude. That was awesome.

1867
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And that was kind of like, I knew who you were.

1868
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Yeah.

1869
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Just from, I guess, being around.

1870
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
But then that was, that was when I was like, that's when I first really remember getting a working.

1871
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Like, you know, I might have seen you on the piece or something.

1872
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
You know, but the first time I ever actually got a working.

1873
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I think that was the first time I ever did some kind of working.

1874
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I think that was the first time I crossed paths with you.

1875
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Yeah.

1876
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Always hear the name out there. I mean, I was roommates with Taco and Taco had nightmares

1877
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.000
stores with you and Chris. Those guys, man, they need a quick beat in us up.

1878
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You were, you were, you were hostile.

1879
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
See on the seals. Yeah.

1880
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
We had the gang mentality for sure.

1881
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
For sure.

1882
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
So when would you do when you got home from that deployment?

1883
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
So got back off that deployment.

1884
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
There was another Petunchev slot open.

1885
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So the seems to be like, hey, man, you, the guy that was going to come doesn't look like

1886
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
a company. You want to do another one. I was like, hell, yeah, so then, you know,

1887
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
started forming up another Petunchev. Got a bunch of new guys in new I see and started

1888
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
another 12 month work up cycle.

1889
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Dang.

1890
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
That's, you have freaking two Petunchev slots.

1891
01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Yep.

1892
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Yep.

1893
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
It was awesome.

1894
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Man, that's the best job in the world.

1895
01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
The task unit spot is good.

1896
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah.

1897
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Yeah.

1898
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
The Petunchev slots a lot.

1899
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Oh, yeah.

1900
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Petunchev.

1901
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I mean, I always say like, E5 and Petunchev.

1902
01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I was just talking to some guys the other night that were E5.

1903
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I'm so glad like, hey, you're good, man.

1904
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
E5 and Petunchev is an awesome place to be.

1905
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And it is.

1906
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
It is. It's an awesome place to be. And hopefully you reach a point where you go,

1907
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I can take care of those awesome guys.

1908
01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Yep.

1909
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
And that's when you go, okay, I'm going to be an hope you're going to be a Petunchev.

1910
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Or I want to be a, you know, if you go the officer route, you can try and go that

1911
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
officer route.

1912
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.000
But at some point, you realize the best thing I can do as it to be a good E5

1913
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
is to take care of the other FEE5s means I got to get promoted.

1914
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I got to take care of them.

1915
01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Yeah.

1916
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And the best way I can do that is to increase my rank a little bit.

1917
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah.

1918
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
I have a little bit more sway.

1919
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Yep.

1920
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
We don't have to do dumb shit.

1921
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yep.

1922
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Yep.

1923
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Yep.

1924
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I'm complaining about my boss.

1925
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
You know, you can only complain so much before you got to actually do something about

1926
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
it.

1927
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yeah.

1928
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Absolutely.

1929
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And it's rare that someone gets to do Platoon Chiefs back to back like that.

1930
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
I mean, no, it's rare that a guy even gets to do two Petunchev slots.

1931
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
That's freaking rare.

1932
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Yeah.

1933
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
You were getting better at it now.

1934
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.000
That's one of the things that I know with the headquarters level that we're looking

1935
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
at.

1936
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Our our our rating really took control over.

1937
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I hate you can only do one.

1938
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
You got to move out of another guy's got to move in and they started looking at that

1939
01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
because you know, we had.

1940
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
We were losing quite a few tactical leaders.

1941
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Like they're guys are getting fired.

1942
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Why are they getting fired?

1943
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Hey, they need more seasoning.

1944
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Yeah.

1945
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Hey, let's grab.

1946
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Let's keep two three guys that are doing really good to keep that.

1947
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Uh.

1948
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Going with the word on looking for continuity continuity at the team.

1949
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
And these are dialed in people.

1950
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
You know, you can count on them and move it forward.

1951
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
So we've got better with with that over the last 10 years.

1952
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
So those guys it's common now for your top two or three guys to stay the team.

1953
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Even if they pick up senior chief.

1954
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
They're going to stay in that Petunchev.

1955
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

1956
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Yeah.

1957
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
That's awesome.

1958
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And so then you do another work up.

1959
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
You must have been freaking dialed now.

1960
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You're doing a second Petunchev.

1961
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
The second Petunchev was way easier than the first.

1962
01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And the first one.

1963
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
So I didn't do a Petunel PO.

1964
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So I was sucking on a fire house.

1965
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Okay.

1966
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You know what I'm saying?

1967
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Yeah.

1968
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So you know, setting up the Petunes.

1969
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
There's just, if you had never worked in training either.

1970
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Nope.

1971
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Not a team.

1972
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Yeah.

1973
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
See, I'll tell you, man.

1974
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:17.000
My whole, you know, that's probably, you know, my first three Petunes.

1975
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
But leaders have strategy tactics.

1976
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
We were talking about my first three Petunes.

1977
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I learned these certain things, right?

1978
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Yeah.

1979
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And I wrote about it.

1980
01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Leadership strategy and tactics.

1981
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
But where that was like where all these seeds got planted.

1982
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Yeah.

1983
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But I'll tell you what.

1984
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
You want to know where the fertilizer and the water came from on those seeds.

1985
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
It was working in training cell.

1986
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It's the old team one.

1987
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Where I was a single, enlisted, he five.

1988
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
And you know what trip I went on?

1989
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Every free trip there was.

1990
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I taught everything.

1991
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
I would volunteer for every course.

1992
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
I, you know, we would go teach land warfare.

1993
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Then I teach diving.

1994
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Then I teach CQC.

1995
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I just do it.

1996
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
And I was the main instructor on any of them.

1997
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Yeah.

1998
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
I was just a guy that was out there like I got on that trip.

1999
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.000
And that's where those little seeds started to come to fruition.

2000
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And the biggest thing was when you're instructing and you know this now that we worked in land warfare.

2001
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:13.000
When you're running, when you're watching I ads or you're teaching I ads, you are defacto detached.

2002
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.000
So you're watching and you can see and you realize how easy it is when you're detached.

2003
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
And when you realize how easy it is when you're detached and you go away to second.

2004
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
If I'm in there, I just need to take a step back and see what the hell's going on.

2005
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And that can make a good call.

2006
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
So that is where I learned so much.

2007
01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
So for you of to not done that definitely had to make your first platoon chief go around a little rough.

2008
01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
It was hard. I got lucky like the our sister platoon.

2009
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
That platoon chief was dialed in.

2010
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
He'd done all those things. He was on his like seven platoon.

2011
01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I was doing my fourth at the time.

2012
01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And so I leaned on him. I'd ask him a hundred billion questions on things.

2013
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
And he always gave me good good guidance man.

2014
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Yeah.

2015
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
So then you get done with that one.

2016
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And now you're going through to get it now you're kind of like,

2017
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I'm like, this is the day you're doing what the same issues.

2018
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I got all my standard operating procedures in place.

2019
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So for every block attorney we're doing a plus you're a freaking combat that.

2020
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
I'm a combat kind of the man.

2021
01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
I'm ready to get after him.

2022
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So it was way easier man way easier.

2023
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You know, you're always going to have those same personnel issues.

2024
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And now you know how to deal with him.

2025
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
You know what right looks like.

2026
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000
And then what was that?

2027
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Then you were going back to Iraq again.

2028
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Yep.

2029
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
So we wound up back over, you know, you guys came in and late September 2003.

2030
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
We went back in September 2004.

2031
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And the place was just the disaster.

2032
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Roadside bombs all over the place.

2033
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000
You know, the drill or the fighters all over the place was a shit show.

2034
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Yeah, that that was the end of my first deployment.

2035
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
It was when we went and got your coupé, which was Saadur's guy.

2036
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
That's the whole freaking thing.

2037
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And two of just a total mayhem.

2038
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Yep.

2039
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And we saw that.

2040
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
We saw the like it was it was a radical change.

2041
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Yeah.

2042
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Because before that, like in would be in March of 2004, it was kind of like,

2043
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Okay, we'll go to a mission in April.

2044
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000
We were, you could look out and you'd see smoke and fire vehicles burning.

2045
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Like it was totally, it was a very different scenario in that one month period in April of 2004.

2046
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Yeah.

2047
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
And it just got worse from there.

2048
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Yeah.

2049
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
And then we'd probably the time you guys showed up.

2050
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Yeah, it was a disaster.

2051
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I remember, and we were doing the PSD mission.

2052
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So we weren't doing a typical direct action.

2053
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
But we got in there in my Paton.

2054
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000
We got split up.

2055
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
So we're in squads now supporting other Patons.

2056
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Because you need X number of people to protect these guys.

2057
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.000
And one of the good things that the headquarters element did is they rotated guys out for

2058
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
sniper mission.

2059
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
So if you're sniper qualified, you come on in.

2060
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
And so we covered down within our PSD elements.

2061
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And guys, you go out and do sniper stuff.

2062
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
So I was lucky.

2063
01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I got to get out there on high for street a couple of times.

2064
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Were you a sniper?

2065
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Yeah.

2066
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Yeah.

2067
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

2068
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah.

2069
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
So I went through and went through sniper school in 98.

2070
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And that was back when there was out at cold.

2071
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
And then stuck.

2072
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
And when I got back off of that deployment, 99, I went to work for Mark.

2073
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
He was running the sniper course.

2074
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000
So I did a couple of instructor, you know, courses with him.

2075
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
So it was good.

2076
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And that helped me out for, you know, the 2003 deployment 2004, the 2006 deployment.

2077
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah.

2078
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
But I remember getting out on high for street.

2079
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000
It was the first time we're out.

2080
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
And we did sniper work in 2003.

2081
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
But there was nothing going on.

2082
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Everything was under control.

2083
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
And I remember going out there.

2084
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000
We're supporting an army unit.

2085
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
They're doing a clearance.

2086
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
So we come in, dump out of the Bradley setup in the buildings.

2087
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
We got all our sectors covered.

2088
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:50.000
And like there's this mooch and an apartment building with an RPG launching RPGs at a patchies that are in the area.

2089
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
And you know, the deal.

2090
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Like you don't shoot a rocket from a room.

2091
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
That's not good.

2092
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Good practice, right?

2093
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
You're going to jack yourself up.

2094
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
He's just in there getting after don't dunk.

2095
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And like so the patchies come in and they're just like,

2096
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
oh, go, go, go, go. And they just take the dude out and you're like,

2097
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Holy shit man, this place is not good.

2098
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Totally different.

2099
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000
And then you come out for extra act.

2100
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
The Brad's are coming in a pole sound.

2101
01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Like there's rounds coming in at you.

2102
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
We didn't deal with that 2003.

2103
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
2003, we had the upper hand.

2104
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.000
You know, you're operating at nighttime.

2105
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But we had the upper hand with what we were doing.

2106
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So it's just, it was different.

2107
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And then at that same time in 2004, you had Phantom Fury out there and

2108
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Felizio going off.

2109
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
You know, and yet good dude supporting that.

2110
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And it's just, I'm ever looking up on the, the jocks screen.

2111
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
And the marines are going through and doing a clearance nighttime.

2112
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And there's like grenades getting chucked out.

2113
01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
And the marines are just going in and getting after it.

2114
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I mean, they're carrying like 25 mags in there.

2115
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Yep.

2116
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
And going building by building.

2117
01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And like God bless the marine core man.

2118
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
These days are like bad asses.

2119
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And we all wanted to be there.

2120
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Like hey, switch with us man.

2121
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Come do the PSD thing.

2122
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
We want to be out there doing what you're doing.

2123
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
But so anyway.

2124
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So you know, Phantom Fury just died down.

2125
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Like hey, we want to send a sniper element up to Samara.

2126
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And so it was like, life got chosen to be a OIC.

2127
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And I was like, hey, they selected me to come in there with life.

2128
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I was like cool, put our 10 man, love man team together.

2129
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Went up to Samara.

2130
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
We thought we were going to get after it.

2131
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.000
You know, it was go time.

2132
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
It was go time.

2133
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.000
We were going to get someone.

2134
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
It was on event pole man, nothing happened.

2135
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000
We set up damn near.

2136
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
We were out in the streets every damn day, sitting up man.

2137
01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
And it was just, you know, that the guys were going after their real cage.

2138
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It was like civilians.

2139
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
You know what you're going to be looking like.

2140
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.000
They come in and said an ID.

2141
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You know, they said it.

2142
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And they'd be out of there.

2143
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
How many, how much did you spend?

2144
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
How much time did you spend on high fester?

2145
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Not much.

2146
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I would say I probably got out there about six or seven times total for that.

2147
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
And I was only in Iraq for 90 days during that time period.

2148
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And then you rotate it out to the Pacific.

2149
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Yep.

2150
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Yep.

2151
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Over to P.I.

2152
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Yep.

2153
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Guam and P.I.

2154
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And the PSD was, look, it was a hard mission and everything.

2155
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Yeah.

2156
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
But relatively un-eventful.

2157
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Because that sort of is possible.

2158
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
So at that time, seals were providing security for the top seven.

2159
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Something like that.

2160
01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Authority's in Iraq.

2161
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And, you know, in charge of keeping them safe.

2162
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
And they did an awesome job.

2163
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Yeah.

2164
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But that, in doing an awesome job, men's there wasn't action.

2165
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Thankfully.

2166
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Yeah.

2167
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Because the action probably would have been a giant 2000-pom v-bid that would have killed everybody.

2168
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Or something crazy like that.

2169
01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yeah.

2170
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
2000-pom v-bid.

2171
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I was at first time, I really started seeing the, you know, the truck bombs, the car bombs,

2172
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
air building.

2173
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And I mean, they built them, you know, they put so much explosives in them that the dam springs

2174
01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
and shocks would break on them.

2175
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
You know, if you're trying to get on base, I'm going to like jack-duff your head.

2176
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Yeah.

2177
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Not good.

2178
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So, but that wrapped up another deployment for you.

2179
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Yep.

2180
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And then, so then what, then what'd you do?

2181
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I stayed at Team 5, I made a senior chief in 2005 picked up a team.

2182
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Did you make it up for going to the fleet UD?

2183
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Yeah.

2184
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I mean, you're making rank quick.

2185
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Yeah.

2186
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000
No, you're making rank quick for, on average above average, it seems like you are.

2187
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Yeah.

2188
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, I would say probably above average up to chief.

2189
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And then, you know, I got passed over the first time for senior chief and then made it

2190
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
the second time.

2191
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So, you know, you don't want guys to make rank too fast. You want guys to really understand what

2192
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
they're doing and why they're doing it, which takes time.

2193
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
It takes a lot of reading, it takes for repetitions.

2194
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And I think when I put on chief, I didn't, I was undergunned, you know, with my training

2195
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
and my experience.

2196
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000
So, it was good that I got passed over my first time for senior chief.

2197
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
You know, so anyway, so I made senior chief in 2005 and then picked up a task in it.

2198
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And, you know, from there, we started working up to relieve you guys.

2199
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
When did you guys know that you were going to relieve us?

2200
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I would say right around March, April, timeframe of 2006, right?

2201
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
When you were going to, so we got there.

2202
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Yep. Right around that same time.

2203
01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Yep. Yep. They're like, hey, you guys are going to come in behind these guys and we're going to

2204
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.000
replace them.

2205
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
At what point did you guys start tracking like, what was happening?

2206
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Did you guys start getting hot and heavy and what made you in timeframe?

2207
01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Yeah, an April time period.

2208
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yeah. Like, as soon as we got there, it was getting crazy.

2209
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
It was right around then.

2210
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And like, we, all of us were just kind of thinking, hey, it's going to be like a

2211
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
fullusious style clearance.

2212
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And fullusious went pretty quick.

2213
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
You know, went pretty quick.

2214
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You know, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of good work being done.

2215
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000
A lot of people getting killed.

2216
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
You a soldiers getting injured.

2217
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:34.000
We thought it was going to be like that.

2218
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:37.000
We didn't know it was going to be what it was.

2219
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
You know, we didn't go on up against that type of enemy before.

2220
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah, well, we thought it was going to be a fullusious type thing too.

2221
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Yeah.

2222
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000
And we talked about this on the unraveling with Darryl Cooper that we,

2223
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Well, that's where we got told when we got there.

2224
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
They're like, hey, you guys are going to, we're going to do

2225
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
fullusious.

2226
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
And we're like, thank you.

2227
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Thank you.

2228
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000
This is going to be because fullusious at that point was a real high watermark for

2229
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
for just awesome crushing kinetic operations by the Marine Corps.

2230
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000
And it was seals in their support and they did a great job.

2231
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
So we were thinking, okay, like, it's on.

2232
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And it's going to be whatever.

2233
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
It's going to be two weeks or three weeks.

2234
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Maybe a fighting and we'll get cleared through this city.

2235
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But it ended up not going that way.

2236
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
And then being that there's a smart move by the prime minister who is a

2237
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Shea to recognize that if if the shea army, which,

2238
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
It basically was a she army went in there and did this type of crushing

2239
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
kinetic sweep through a body, which was most, which was Sunni.

2240
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:45.000
They would have set up Sunni versus Shea civil war.

2241
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And so he said, we're not doing that.

2242
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
You're going to find another way to do it.

2243
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000
And the other way to do it was a counter insurgency was going into the neighborhoods

2244
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
and trying to preserve the infrastructure and trying to keep the civil

2245
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:03.000
impopulous as safe as you can as you do it. And yet at the same time

2246
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
do battle with these insurgents.

2247
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
So that's what that's what we ended up doing.

2248
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
And I always wonder what it was like for you guys once we started taking

2249
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
a lot of casualties.

2250
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Once we started losing guys, you guys must have been like,

2251
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:25.000
a little nervous about coming.

2252
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Oh, hell yeah.

2253
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
Absolutely man.

2254
01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
No one had been through that amount of combat.

2255
01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Like for us at that point, heavy combat.

2256
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
You know, we had our group,

2257
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Commodore, he was out there with us doing our,

2258
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
you know, ORE, what do they call the final battle problem?

2259
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And he's like, man, you guys are going to a body stand by.

2260
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
There's a lot going on there.

2261
01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
There's like, I mean a lot going on there.

2262
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And I think things really hit home for us.

2263
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Like, remember, Cali, Cali come a bang when he was shot.

2264
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And like you look at the essential like, okay,

2265
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
that's manageable. Like, he shot.

2266
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.000
He's coming in through. It looks like he's going to be okay.

2267
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And then shit really hit the fan for us when Mark was killed.

2268
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Really like holy shit.

2269
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
This is we're going into something that we like,

2270
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
you know, we hadn't been in before.

2271
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So we had like, we dialed in our training.

2272
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
We had like, we're giving this information.

2273
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Tell one of us everything you're doing.

2274
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
What's working? What's not working?

2275
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
We had some hard conversations with our operators.

2276
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Hey, man, like someone's going to get wounded.

2277
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Someone might get killed. Like,

2278
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
there's some of these things we can't control.

2279
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
What we can do is our rehearsals,

2280
01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
train to this, make good decisions on the battlefield

2281
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
to reduce our casually levels.

2282
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
But we're going to be shot at.

2283
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Someone's going to get hit. That's coming.

2284
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And at the end of the day, it's going to be a stand in here.

2285
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
That's going to kind of get us out of this shit.

2286
01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
We're going to be going to be a tight game.

2287
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
We've got to be tight with what we're doing.

2288
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And the guys understood that.

2289
01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
You know, the guys understood that.

2290
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
But it's different when you get on the ground.

2291
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And you got a lot of rounds coming out to you.

2292
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
You know, yeah, you know,

2293
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I'm trying to think of a way to explain the difference

2294
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
in my mind that you got.

2295
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Like, it seems like, but prior to that point,

2296
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
most of the times when guys would go out.

2297
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
You want to guys would go out and get wounded or

2298
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
guys would go out and know what had been killed.

2299
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And I rack yet, but even in Afghanistan,

2300
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
it was like, it was a mission, right?

2301
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.000
It was like a mission, an isolated mission where

2302
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
something had happened.

2303
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And then once that isolated mission is over,

2304
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
it's like you reset the clock.

2305
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And now, okay, we're in a different,

2306
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
it's a different mission.

2307
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
And so it's almost like you do get to reset the clock.

2308
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
But in a body, it was like you were in the same game.

2309
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
And the clock was freaking ticking the whole time.

2310
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And so you guys knew that you were just going to come

2311
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
and get in the game and it wasn't going to be one mission.

2312
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
And it wasn't going to be three missions.

2313
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
It was going to be mission after mission after mission after mission.

2314
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And it was going to be as many days as you were there.

2315
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
And yeah, I remember you guys showing up.

2316
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
And I remember actually briefing your task unit

2317
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
and literally saying,

2318
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
you guys are going to, you guys are going to take casualties.

2319
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Which was the, it was the thing I was thinking of myself.

2320
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Do I say that?

2321
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Is that a bad attitude?

2322
01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Is that a negative attitude?

2323
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Is that a self-fulfilling prophecy?

2324
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
Or is that just the fucking truth about what's going on?

2325
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And I would rather have you guys thinking,

2326
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
okay, this is the truth.

2327
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
And if we can avoid it, great,

2328
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
but we have to be ready.

2329
01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And we need to do everything we can, but we got to be ready for it.

2330
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yep.

2331
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I remember you guys were telling us, man,

2332
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
we had, we had our go bags ready.

2333
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000
So we got some get-singer to our standard operating procedure in place.

2334
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Who's going with the guy that's injured,

2335
01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
all of our passports,

2336
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
ID's everything we're in the bag.

2337
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Someone gets injured, boom, they're getting on the heel with the injured guy.

2338
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
They're pushing out, you know,

2339
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
at least getting them over to Germany.

2340
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So we were definitely in the right mindset.

2341
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
You know, in our first op-out there,

2342
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
you guys helped set that up out there at Firecracker.

2343
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Oh yeah.

2344
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And that was, that was a good one with the Marine Corps.

2345
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
We said you guys have to firecracker for you.

2346
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Yeah, first op.

2347
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
So, you know, you're like, hey,

2348
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
you guys are going around race track.

2349
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And we'll just call this,

2350
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
we'll call this operation Firecracker.

2351
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Because there's going to be some shit going down up there.

2352
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Yeah.

2353
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:24.000
It was, it was a good first shake out,

2354
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
you know, in the Marine Corps's up there.

2355
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You know, the Colonel that was running the Marine Corps for a good,

2356
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000
his name.

2357
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yeah, you just took good outstanding,

2358
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
good leader, just good, like good dude, man.

2359
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
So we set that up.

2360
01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
You know, there's, you know, our guys,

2361
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
our sniper's killed a few guys on that one,

2362
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
and the shoot was good.

2363
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
You know, and they, I'm just memory,

2364
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I was at home be out in the street and he's pulling security down from us.

2365
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
And the dude starts, you know,

2366
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000
gets a little bit of an RPG and like the Marines are dumping out of it.

2367
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
They're doing cover move drills, getting back.

2368
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And they're taking small arms fire and work position where we can't,

2369
01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
you know, the enemies in dead space,

2370
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
we can't even do anything to support them.

2371
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
They come back and there's a couple, like smaller mortars that came in that day.

2372
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
You know, didn't hit our building,

2373
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.000
the front of us there, wasn't too bad there or small,

2374
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
but it was a good, it was a good shake out for us,

2375
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
like a little confidence builder,

2376
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
like a couple bad guys, no one got injured.

2377
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
These are all good things.

2378
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And then you guys start started rolling.

2379
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Then we started rolling in our first,

2380
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I was on that mission.

2381
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
The next mission we did,

2382
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I was not on.

2383
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
And our guys went up down the street,

2384
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I think from Falcon and other set and up over watch positions.

2385
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:34.000
And, you know,

2386
01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.000
they're, I think they're in the morning time and grenades come in.

2387
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
You know, I think they had one or two grenades come in.

2388
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
They all grenades,

2389
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.000
the guys are diving down the stairs and we had two guys get fragged from those.

2390
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
And from that point,

2391
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
it was like, all right,

2392
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
you know, we knew we were getting into, but then it's like,

2393
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
now it's real.

2394
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
You know, now our guys are getting injured.

2395
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
We knew we were going to get wounded.

2396
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Now you got two guys moving with frags.

2397
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And their injuries weren't bad enough.

2398
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
They had to get mad about it out.

2399
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
So they stayed with us, you know,

2400
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
and talking about three weeks to heal up in their,

2401
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
they were okay.

2402
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And that was like your second op.

2403
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Yep.

2404
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
That was like our second one.

2405
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Yeah.

2406
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yeah.

2407
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Yeah.

2408
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And then, you know, throughout that thing there,

2409
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
you know, one of the things I realized,

2410
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
and this is further down the road,

2411
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
but we did this, this river often.

2412
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
We're going to set support setting up a combat outpost.

2413
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
And we're using the marine river.

2414
01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Yeah.

2415
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000
You know,

2416
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
and they're awesome.

2417
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
But think out funny that is like,

2418
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
maybe they're supposed to deliver the marine's, the other marine's are deliver enough.

2419
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And they were good dudes, man.

2420
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000
They were down there.

2421
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:35.000
They were awesome.

2422
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.000
They were square away.

2423
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
So they take us down river.

2424
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
And we had all of our deep conflicts and up payers.

2425
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
When we get this point in the water,

2426
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
call it to the security army security check point up ahead.

2427
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Make sure everything's dialed in.

2428
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Went through all the procedures.

2429
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
And there was obviously a disconnect.

2430
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So we get close to where we're going.

2431
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
And we can see the security position off to the right.

2432
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
And it's on a two story building.

2433
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
And we get that.

2434
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
And we get that.

2435
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And we're like,

2436
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000
that's not good.

2437
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000
That's around coming over our head from the security position.

2438
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And then we're like,

2439
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000
like your strobes do your shit.

2440
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And then the boat starts speeding up a little bit to get us to shore.

2441
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:09.000
And like,

2442
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Now we're all pissed because we just got shot at it.

2443
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And then we get the.

2444
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000
You know,

2445
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
like,

2446
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000
for a can traders are coming over.

2447
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000
So we're like,

2448
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
you can get us to the shoreline, man.

2449
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
So we get to the shoreline.

2450
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And we're dumping out at that point.

2451
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000
It's a full on.

2452
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Dude, I just got chills.

2453
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Right.

2454
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000
He's got chills.

2455
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Because when you're talking about your received fire from

2456
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
the friendlies,

2457
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.000
it's really uncorrible.

2458
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000
And then it's a full on.

2459
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000
We're not shooting back.

2460
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Yeah.

2461
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000
But then it's full on.

2462
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
They think we're moved in boats coming down the river.

2463
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And it's just.

2464
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
We're dumping off in the tolies.

2465
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
And I'm I'm freaking hot, man.

2466
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
So I'm dumping in the side of the tolies.

2467
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
And we learned from you guys.

2468
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Hey,

2469
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Do you conflict that with your white star cluster?

2470
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
So I had all trusty right here.

2471
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000
You know,

2472
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and as I'm going to the shoreline,

2473
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I'm popping this thing out.

2474
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
My weapons flying all over the place.

2475
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
And I'm yelling at the A O I C.

2476
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I was like, Hey,

2477
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
freaking call back to your get this shit.

2478
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
You conflicted now.

2479
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And I'm pissed.

2480
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I'm yelling at him.

2481
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000
I'm yelling.

2482
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I'm like, what the after you think I'm doing?

2483
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
What the after you think I'm doing?

2484
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
I'm like, fucking hurry up, man.

2485
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And so we're yelling back and forth.

2486
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And popping up the white star cluster.

2487
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And it of course, as soon as you get the white star

2488
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000
cluster up,

2489
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000
the shit stops.

2490
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Yeah.

2491
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
But I couldn't get to that damn thing fast enough.

2492
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.000
By the time I got it,

2493
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I had it out.

2494
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Probably like less than 30 seconds.

2495
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Dude,

2496
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
30 seconds of long time to be receiving fire from

2497
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
American machine gunners.

2498
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Yeah, we were all sucking my advice.

2499
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It was a good lesson learned.

2500
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
One of the things with the body is when you go

2501
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
into a high stress environment.

2502
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000
There's multiple units in the area.

2503
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
The likelihood of you having a blue on blue.

2504
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
You just go up drastically.

2505
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know, you've done a lot of podcasts with a

2506
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Vietnam shit.

2507
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So when you're in those type of environments,

2508
01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
you've got to have your deconstruction down.

2509
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
You can't do it enough.

2510
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Really.

2511
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000
And you know, another thing I've been thinking about

2512
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
is from a leadership perspective.

2513
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
A thing that I've been talking about all the time is like,

2514
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
if you work for me,

2515
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
and I come to talk to you,

2516
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I got to understand what your perspective is.

2517
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000
I got to understand that.

2518
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
So that I can like,

2519
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000
okay, he's reacting like this because of that.

2520
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And even more in depth than that,

2521
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
I got to kind of know what your freaking story is.

2522
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
So I can't just know your perspective.

2523
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
I got to know what your story is.

2524
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Oh, this is Steve. He's he's been here for 20 years.

2525
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
He's he's done a good job.

2526
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
He also is known for having a bad temper.

2527
01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
He also has some trouble at home right now.

2528
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
So I got to know this stuff.

2529
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yeah.

2530
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
So that I can assess like,

2531
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
okay, what approach am I going to take?

2532
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.000
What reaction am I going to get?

2533
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Well, guess what?

2534
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000
When you're in a combat situation,

2535
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
you better think about the perspective of the people

2536
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
that you're working with.

2537
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Yeah.

2538
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
Because guess what?

2539
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
The kid that's 18 years old,

2540
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
he's scared shitless.

2541
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
He doesn't he he's freaking sick of being on this post.

2542
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
He's afraid he's going to get killed.

2543
01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
He's not being briefed by his seniors.

2544
01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
He's tired.

2545
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:00.000
He's pissed off.

2546
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
He's got an itchy trigger finger.

2547
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And what do you think this guy's going to do?

2548
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Yeah.

2549
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.000
He's going to shoot at you.

2550
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000
Yeah.

2551
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
If you don't make it clear, what's happening?

2552
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Yeah.

2553
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
So it's important to remember that.

2554
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
When you have to understand other people's perspective,

2555
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
and understand what their story is,

2556
01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000
and then you need to account for that somehow.

2557
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Otherwise bad things happen.

2558
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
And like that's a nightmare, man.

2559
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Like if those, those, those know protection on those surf boats.

2560
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I mean, you're, if that, if one,

2561
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
one iteration of fire hit those surf boats,

2562
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
you'd have three, four guys dead wounded, whatever.

2563
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Maybe more.

2564
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Yep.

2565
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
You got 10 guys in a boat.

2566
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Damn, it's a nightmare.

2567
01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yeah.

2568
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
It wasn't good. I didn't just talk about perspective.

2569
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I know the army guys.

2570
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
There were a couple units there that, you know,

2571
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
they'd been there for like eight months.

2572
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I want to say like eight months.

2573
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
And then they get the call.

2574
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Hey, you're going to stay like three more months.

2575
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Oh, yeah.

2576
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And then dudes are wore out, man.

2577
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
I mean, they're pulling security out front,

2578
01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
they're taking round RPG rounds.

2579
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
They've lost two,

2580
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
they're friends,

2581
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.000
three other friends for their friends.

2582
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
They've seen VBIDs go in.

2583
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Yeah.

2584
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
They've heard rumors about boats.

2585
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I mean,

2586
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.000
yeah.

2587
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
And look, the army guys and the Marines that were there,

2588
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
the most professional badass dudes ever.

2589
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Yeah.

2590
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Ever.

2591
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000
But there's a lot of them.

2592
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
Yeah.

2593
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
And if you have, look,

2594
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
you can have a platoon of 40 guys and 39 of them.

2595
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Can be the most square to weigh guys.

2596
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
You've ever met and can understand everything and become cool and collected.

2597
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000
But there's going to be one person in there.

2598
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
That's not.

2599
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Yeah.

2600
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And once one person starts shooting,

2601
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
bro.

2602
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Yeah.

2603
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000
It's a real problem to get.

2604
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
It's a real problem.

2605
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I think other people aren't going to start shooting as well.

2606
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
That's that's what we literally get trained to do.

2607
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Oh, if there's a contact start shooting,

2608
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
help your buddy.

2609
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Yeah.

2610
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Not, uh,

2611
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000
not good.

2612
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Understandable,

2613
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
but not, not a good situation.

2614
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000
We definitely get a better job on that with us.

2615
01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Um,

2616
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Yeah.

2617
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Wasn't good.

2618
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.000
We're lucky.

2619
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:03.000
No one got in on that one.

2620
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Yeah.

2621
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
We had one other blue on blue that I know about.

2622
01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:09.000
There's, there's, there's, I'm a convention.

2623
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
It's probably quite a few blue on blues going on.

2624
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
You just don't, you don't know.

2625
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Um, there was, because I was, I was,

2626
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
we're talking about this with the brigade commander all the time.

2627
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000
There was one, there was usually one blue on blue per day per day.

2628
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Yeah.

2629
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.000
But that, that wouldn't get reported.

2630
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And there was a one blue on blue per week that actually got reported.

2631
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Yeah.

2632
01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Of like, hey, we were taking fire from this unit at this time.

2633
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Most of them was like, hey,

2634
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I've got a few fire, she's fire.

2635
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
You know, that's friendly position like that happened,

2636
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
all the, it happened once a day.

2637
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Yeah.

2638
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
One to day, you know, usually at night.

2639
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000
But the, the most harrowing example of that was

2640
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000
there was a blue on blue between humvies.

2641
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Like one humvie at night saw another humvie and started shooting.

2642
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Yeah.

2643
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
And there wasn't no mouss that had humvies.

2644
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah.

2645
01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Like at least the boat, the boats weren't super common to be in the river.

2646
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Even the Marine Corps boats.

2647
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
They weren't super common to be in the river.

2648
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.76
roll about. Some goes, oh wait a second. I don't know what this is. This might be

2649
01:46:05.76 --> 01:46:10.68
moust boats. Let's shoot a, but a humvee. Like that's how itchy the trigger

2650
01:46:10.68 --> 01:46:13.80
fingers can get. And you got to understand people's perspective, man. We were so

2651
01:46:13.80 --> 01:46:18.44
freaking paranoid about that stuff. Yeah. It was, uh, it wasn't a good feeling. That's

2652
01:46:18.44 --> 01:46:22.20
for sure. Geez. There's nothing you can't, like, what are you going to do?

2653
01:46:22.20 --> 01:46:26.20
Shoot back? No, like you can't do that. No. Yeah. You've grabbed that damn

2654
01:46:26.20 --> 01:46:32.32
white star cluster and get fired off. Boy. Damn. We had one of the blue

2655
01:46:32.32 --> 01:46:37.96
we were out there earlier down there by Grant. Com Grant. And we went to the

2656
01:46:37.96 --> 01:46:41.84
unit, decinfilted everything. And, you know, our guys went out there and

2657
01:46:41.84 --> 01:46:46.60
were getting set up on a rooftop and like, shoot. They come all

2658
01:46:46.60 --> 01:46:53.48
manned. Yeah. You know what, one good. But, um, those high stress level areas

2659
01:46:53.48 --> 01:46:56.48
people are getting wounded and shit. People are seeing different things.

2660
01:46:56.48 --> 01:47:00.16
That's out there. It's real. You got to be careful. Yeah, when

2661
01:47:00.16 --> 01:47:03.48
they've made a road extreme ownership, like we didn't plan to write. There's three

2662
01:47:03.48 --> 01:47:07.76
chapters in there that are just blue on blue chapters. Yeah. Out of 12 chapters. Yeah.

2663
01:47:07.76 --> 01:47:11.56
So, a quarter of the chapters are about blue on blue. Like, that's, we didn't

2664
01:47:11.56 --> 01:47:14.40
think about that. But that's what the reality of the situation was.

2665
01:47:14.40 --> 01:47:17.76
Those are some of the scariest. You know what's crazy? When we went back to

2666
01:47:17.76 --> 01:47:22.64
trade that and we incorporated our, our laser gear. Oh, yeah. People found out how

2667
01:47:22.64 --> 01:47:26.16
easy it is to, uh, blue on blue just to your point with perspectives. Like, we

2668
01:47:26.16 --> 01:47:34.16
drew that out. It was awesome to draw that out and training. Um, yeah. So,

2669
01:47:34.16 --> 01:47:38.72
you know, so after, you know, after those handful of ops, we had, uh, you

2670
01:47:38.72 --> 01:47:42.88
know, we had no rubber 19. And so this is putting us, you know, right

2671
01:47:42.88 --> 01:47:46.64
before Thanksgiving and we had the whole task in or out. And so we had, uh,

2672
01:47:46.64 --> 01:47:51.12
you know, our crudged or guys are up in the papa, sectors are, are, are,

2673
01:47:51.12 --> 01:47:57.36
are you, patoon is down. We're down past Grant. I think we're down past ground

2674
01:47:57.36 --> 01:48:00.80
that area. We're about eight blocks from those guys. Half mile miles. Something

2675
01:48:00.80 --> 01:48:06.56
like that. Maybe Julie, yet. Yeah, Julie at sector. Yeah. I don't remember

2676
01:48:06.56 --> 01:48:10.000
all the sectors, but man, we're out there and things are going good. And like

2677
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.80
eight o'clock in the morning, we're set up. We got mutually sporting

2678
01:48:12.80 --> 01:48:15.60
positions with our patoon. They got mutually sporting, uh, supporting

2679
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:18.56
positions with their patoon. Things are good. And I remember the first

2680
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:21.52
thing was like, all right, this is going to be a shit chill in here. You know,

2681
01:48:21.52 --> 01:48:25.36
we had a car going around with the, the hazard zone, you know, so there's

2682
01:48:25.36 --> 01:48:28.24
signally in the area. Hey, man, US troops are in there, but they didn't

2683
01:48:28.24 --> 01:48:31.84
know where we're at. We didn't have any, you know, loopholes. We didn't

2684
01:48:31.84 --> 01:48:35.76
pound out any, any, any brick or use explosives. So they had a hard time

2685
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:39.28
figuring out where we were, they're out the whole day. But as we're sitting there

2686
01:48:39.28 --> 01:48:42.32
thanks start heating up, you know, either's maims over two streets over

2687
01:48:42.32 --> 01:48:45.12
and they're all consolidating one area. They got weapons. And then,

2688
01:48:45.12 --> 01:48:47.60
you know, it's coming. We're going to get, we're going to get in the mix

2689
01:48:47.60 --> 01:48:52.56
here. And so like around 11 o'clock, we started calling in for our,

2690
01:48:52.56 --> 01:48:55.84
our gimmlers, we're going to guided multiple launch wrong

2691
01:48:55.84 --> 01:48:59.76
system. And we started getting not ready to

2692
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:03.76
generate coordinates to bring in rockets because there's different

2693
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:06.80
requirements. That wasn't coming from off the rails from the air.

2694
01:49:06.80 --> 01:49:10.72
So it was easier to get it approved. And so as we're doing that, you know,

2695
01:49:10.72 --> 01:49:14.24
we get a call over the radio, you know, that, you know, our other unit from

2696
01:49:14.24 --> 01:49:17.04
Corrigator was hit. And we didn't know how bad they were hit, but, you know,

2697
01:49:17.04 --> 01:49:20.56
the, the AOSC came on as I came in earlier, it's had these in bad,

2698
01:49:20.56 --> 01:49:23.28
he's in bad shape. And so it was Joe, you know, and we're like, oh,

2699
01:49:23.28 --> 01:49:26.48
shit, man. And, you know, they're taking them down to the cash and

2700
01:49:26.48 --> 01:49:31.20
shit. Which wasn't good. And we're like, everyone just got a sick

2701
01:49:31.20 --> 01:49:34.000
feeling into their stomach. You know, we didn't know what happened

2702
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.48
until after we got back. But we're like, shit, he's going to make it. He's not

2703
01:49:36.48 --> 01:49:38.88
going to make it. But, you know, those guys were in a position. They started

2704
01:49:38.88 --> 01:49:42.88
taking light fire. And as they're taking light fire, you know, they had rooftop

2705
01:49:42.88 --> 01:49:45.52
jumpers in a body. They'd get as close as they could. And they dump

2706
01:49:45.52 --> 01:49:48.56
grenades right on top of your position. So the first thing that happened is

2707
01:49:48.56 --> 01:49:52.96
that a grenade dumped on their position. And Ellie gets sliced in the dam,

2708
01:49:52.96 --> 01:49:56.96
wrist pretty bad. So, you know, their collapse and off down off the rooftop. And

2709
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:00.48
we had explosives up there. So the guys are clapping off explosives to, you

2710
01:50:00.48 --> 01:50:04.48
know, move the rooftop jumpers away from from their guys. So as they

2711
01:50:04.48 --> 01:50:09.12
collapsed down into, you know, on the bottom floor, everything still

2712
01:50:09.12 --> 01:50:12.48
on the control. There's a light ball in a fire. They're calling to the other,

2713
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:16.16
the other sniper supporting element, A were hit. We're going to call in the next

2714
01:50:16.16 --> 01:50:19.28
track. There's a calling the next track. You know, the, the, the, the

2715
01:50:19.28 --> 01:50:24.08
Iraqis come out and our unit comes out to get in the Bradley's. And, you know,

2716
01:50:24.08 --> 01:50:27.60
their hit was some type of white phosphorus explosive device. And I did a

2717
01:50:27.60 --> 01:50:30.88
lot of analysis on it. What that was at a roadside bomb. What was it?

2718
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:34.88
I can never determine what it was. But, you know, killed. I think three Iraqis

2719
01:50:34.88 --> 01:50:38.96
wounded two are two guys. Our two seals were hit critically injured. You

2720
01:50:38.96 --> 01:50:42.88
know, so now they're pulling everyone back into the house. The Bradley's

2721
01:50:42.88 --> 01:50:46.64
are getting out of there because it's just a total shit show. The other

2722
01:50:46.64 --> 01:50:49.52
units fighting their way down the street to get in a position to help these

2723
01:50:49.52 --> 01:50:55.12
guys out by this by this time. In long story short, you know, everyone's in a

2724
01:50:55.12 --> 01:50:56.64
bad position. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,

2725
01:50:56.64 --> 01:51:00.96
it was such a, uh, such a good dude. He's sitting there telling dudes. He's

2726
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:04.40
cool comic collect. He's got shit burning on him. You know, burning through his

2727
01:51:04.40 --> 01:51:07.44
camis and he's telling guys what to do to how to patch him up and do all

2728
01:51:07.44 --> 01:51:11.68
this shit and he's jacked up. Um, you know, Joe, he had his legs kind of

2729
01:51:11.68 --> 01:51:16.16
blown backwards on his lower extremities. So it's a complex situation. You know,

2730
01:51:16.16 --> 01:51:20.40
outside still heated up injured guys on the inside dead guys. Our own

2731
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:23.76
dead guys. Our Iraqi troops out on the street. Guys fighting their ways

2732
01:51:23.76 --> 01:51:28.16
back down. It's like, his bad as a situation is, is you can conjure up,

2733
01:51:28.16 --> 01:51:31.92
right? You know, they get things under control that call in another

2734
01:51:31.92 --> 01:51:35.28
quick-goer actionary force. They load these guys up. And, you know, and that's

2735
01:51:35.28 --> 01:51:38.48
when we get the call over the radio that those guys have been hit. Meanwhile,

2736
01:51:38.48 --> 01:51:41.44
over on our sector things are starting to heat up. And so we're

2737
01:51:41.44 --> 01:51:44.16
spinning up aircraft. We're trying to get our gimlers in

2738
01:51:44.16 --> 01:51:47.28
position to start launching. And, you know, our guys are out there,

2739
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:49.92
you know, laying down to made up fire and launching a few

2740
01:51:49.92 --> 01:51:54.96
Carl Gustav rockets into some positions down there by us. But it was just, you know,

2741
01:51:54.96 --> 01:51:58.96
shitty day for us, you know, obviously the whole task you know, was hit,

2742
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:07.28
was hit hard on that. Wasn't good. Yeah. And, I mean, Elliot is probably

2743
01:52:07.28 --> 01:52:12.56
one of the most severely wounded seals from the Iraq war. Yeah.

2744
01:52:12.56 --> 01:52:18.72
Yeah. He's, I mean, he's freaking warrior. Yeah. But he, he took a heavy hit that day.

2745
01:52:18.72 --> 01:52:23.20
Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, an Elliot story, you know, I got never quit. He never

2746
01:52:23.20 --> 01:52:29.52
gave up on life. And, you know, he's going through physical therapy. And

2747
01:52:29.52 --> 01:52:33.44
him and his physical therapist falling love. And, Elliot,

2748
01:52:33.44 --> 01:52:38.16
merrier, they get married. They have kids. What you're just asked, you know, I've

2749
01:52:38.16 --> 01:52:41.52
seen Elliot a handful of times over the years, you know, it

2750
01:52:41.52 --> 01:52:46.48
buds graduations and stuff like that. You know, just sucks that shit. I'm

2751
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:50.96
doing that. Yeah. And, and, and, life was super good friends with Elliot. And, you

2752
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:55.36
know, obviously we had just all high five done the tarmac and said goodbye. And,

2753
01:52:55.36 --> 01:52:59.12
and then the next thing the laves doing, he's down at the burn center. You know,

2754
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:02.40
trying to try and give support to Elliot. You know, it's freaking,

2755
01:53:03.84 --> 01:53:08.40
freaking rough man. That shit took the, uh, that took the wind out of

2756
01:53:08.40 --> 01:53:11.52
our cell for the whole task. You know, you're just wondering like what the hell is

2757
01:53:11.52 --> 01:53:15.68
going out? And, you see, so now we got two guys wounded with frags. You got

2758
01:53:15.68 --> 01:53:19.52
Joe and Elliot with what they got going on. And, actually, the first week we were

2759
01:53:19.52 --> 01:53:22.72
there, you know, we had Jimmy left over from you guys and you get to get shot. He

2760
01:53:22.72 --> 01:53:29.20
gets a grayser. Crosses nipple. So, yeah, things were starting to stack up, man.

2761
01:53:29.20 --> 01:53:32.32
You know, and Elliot was a unknown, what he wanted. Sure, if he was going to make it or

2762
01:53:32.32 --> 01:53:37.68
not. Yeah, and I left October 21st and that was November 19th. So, you

2763
01:53:37.68 --> 01:53:41.84
guys, it only been on the ground without us for under a month. Yeah.

2764
01:53:41.84 --> 01:53:44.96
Yep. And he had all this already stacked up. Yep. Yep.

2765
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:51.92
Yeah. We, it's not to mention in a way you are writing in already with

2766
01:53:51.92 --> 01:53:57.28
the mental fault of all of our casualties and our lost guys. Yeah. You know, so you

2767
01:53:57.28 --> 01:54:03.36
already know that this is just the way. Yeah. Yeah. We had, uh, you know, so we

2768
01:54:03.36 --> 01:54:09.12
get past November 19th. We're kind of re-organ and things are starting to

2769
01:54:09.12 --> 01:54:12.16
change at that point. I can't remember if it was November December, but you

2770
01:54:12.16 --> 01:54:16.08
know, we had one of the tribes out there that al-Qaida come in and they

2771
01:54:16.08 --> 01:54:20.96
killed a couple of their tribes. And they were like, F al-Qaida, we want to come over to the

2772
01:54:20.96 --> 01:54:25.28
you know, US side. And that was a big tip and point out there, a

2773
01:54:25.28 --> 01:54:29.52
correct order. I forget the name of the tribe out there. But the guys went out there

2774
01:54:29.52 --> 01:54:32.32
and they're meeting up with the shake and they're local guys and it was a

2775
01:54:32.32 --> 01:54:36.32
weird situation. Because at that point, those guys were dropping motors on

2776
01:54:36.32 --> 01:54:39.84
correct order. So, there's this friction like I freaking help and these dudes out,

2777
01:54:39.84 --> 01:54:42.88
they want to join us now. They're just, you know, the other day they're dropping

2778
01:54:42.88 --> 01:54:49.20
motors on us, you know. So that was, that was, that was interesting. And then

2779
01:54:49.20 --> 01:54:55.68
December timeframe, we'd set up, uh, I think was right before Christmas. We're up

2780
01:54:55.68 --> 01:54:59.20
there around racetrack and the Marine Corps didn't a big huge push

2781
01:54:59.20 --> 01:55:02.48
in through to clear out that whole area. That area was still pretty much

2782
01:55:02.48 --> 01:55:05.36
contested when you guys were there. And that was an area we'd operate

2783
01:55:05.36 --> 01:55:09.76
in quite a bit. And so we're out there for like, I don't know, three, four days. And this

2784
01:55:09.76 --> 01:55:12.96
is right before Christmas time. We think we're going to be out there past

2785
01:55:12.96 --> 01:55:17.20
Christmas. And a couple of events there like the the moves there were so good at

2786
01:55:17.20 --> 01:55:20.56
using dead space. You know, I remember we're on a two-story building. We got

2787
01:55:20.56 --> 01:55:24.32
Marine Corps sniper's in position. We're in position. We're spread out. And

2788
01:55:24.32 --> 01:55:27.60
I go to use the bathroom and I'm looking out this window and there's a tank

2789
01:55:27.60 --> 01:55:32.48
down in my corner. And a dude slips out of dead space with an RPG in like

2790
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:36.24
moves. Boom. He clocks that thing off in under three seconds, melts back

2791
01:55:36.24 --> 01:55:40.32
away. And you're like, even if I was on my gun, I don't think I had enough time to

2792
01:55:40.32 --> 01:55:44.88
shoot that guy. We had a couple clothes calls in that area. You know, they

2793
01:55:44.88 --> 01:55:49.20
had some snipers in vehicles. And so in muffled the sound, you couldn't tell

2794
01:55:49.20 --> 01:55:52.88
where they were coming from. You know, and when, uh, you know, I took a

2795
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:57.12
damn shot and through our position right at the 12 o'clock. So, you know,

2796
01:55:57.12 --> 01:56:01.52
we got our loophole set up and around 762 by 54 big one punches all the

2797
01:56:01.52 --> 01:56:04.72
way through the wall. Right at the 12 o'clock position. So the guy's dead

2798
01:56:04.72 --> 01:56:09.04
center trying to get into our whole where we're at. And I just remember

2799
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:12.96
thinking, damn man, that's whoever shot that. That's a good shot. That's not,

2800
01:56:12.96 --> 01:56:19.28
you know, some JB dude making that shot. Um, and as I got to tell

2801
01:56:19.28 --> 01:56:22.16
this story, I forgot about this one, but we had our country boy,

2802
01:56:22.16 --> 01:56:24.88
old Charlie, he's out now. So I'll say his name on it out. But Charlie,

2803
01:56:24.88 --> 01:56:30.16
we're on the, this is all in this three, four day period. And uh,

2804
01:56:30.16 --> 01:56:34.32
we're on the rooftop. And that's the same day that I take that round and through the 12 o'clock

2805
01:56:34.32 --> 01:56:40.24
position. And there's moves doing a center peel down the street. And so like I'm here,

2806
01:56:40.24 --> 01:56:44.16
Charlie's position is over here with his crew. And we got a pilot up over

2807
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:47.36
hand and he's like, hey, you got some, you got bad guys coming down the street

2808
01:56:47.36 --> 01:56:50.16
towards you. And you know, Charlie's just a good old country boy. He's like

2809
01:56:50.16 --> 01:56:56.64
Roger that, you know, he's like, fire out. He dumps a flag. And it like,

2810
01:56:56.64 --> 01:57:00.72
hit, I don't know how he does. He throws a flag in the blind. Those are down on the street.

2811
01:57:00.72 --> 01:57:04.64
It hits in between where these moves are right. And the pilots more excited than any

2812
01:57:04.64 --> 01:57:08.72
police. I guess I got to direct it. And so I don't direct it. And I'm like,

2813
01:57:08.72 --> 01:57:11.84
talking to Charlie, what do you do? So I was just popmarked right in through it.

2814
01:57:11.84 --> 01:57:16.32
I'll throw you know, I'll just rock Roger that dude. So you guys, you guys were

2815
01:57:16.32 --> 01:57:21.04
getting an aircraft overhead inside the city. Yeah, we, you know, on the

2816
01:57:21.04 --> 01:57:25.92
daily, God hit, we had a, I don't know, as a 14 or 15. Okay, fast movers. Yeah,

2817
01:57:25.92 --> 01:57:30.24
fast. You are getting heels. Where are you? No. Yeah. I don't remember having any

2818
01:57:30.24 --> 01:57:34.80
heels. There to be too slow. Yeah, the heels wouldn't come in for us,

2819
01:57:36.40 --> 01:57:40.40
because that reason they want to freaking black lockdown scenario on the fold,

2820
01:57:40.40 --> 01:57:46.16
which, which would have. Yeah, the Apache's came in one time. And they left and didn't come back.

2821
01:57:46.16 --> 01:57:50.80
Yeah, they got, they got lit up like it was crazy. It was an crazy amount of volume of fire.

2822
01:57:50.80 --> 01:57:54.64
We were putting it in a combat outpost. And they came in. They said they want to

2823
01:57:54.64 --> 01:58:01.44
support. They flew in and it was like, it was crazy. Yeah. They flew away and didn't come back.

2824
01:58:01.44 --> 01:58:05.20
We, man, things were so confusing over there. I remember being out there in positions. And

2825
01:58:05.20 --> 01:58:10.96
now we had, you know, these two young ladies and they're doing clothes, they're hanging clothes.

2826
01:58:10.96 --> 01:58:15.44
And then this other, what looks like the lady comes out there and she's like laying clothes out.

2827
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:20.40
But the third person that came out late, they're just looking everywhere. They're looking

2828
01:58:20.40 --> 01:58:24.40
for us. And it was a dude just like a woman. You know, they got the garb over their head. So

2829
01:58:24.40 --> 01:58:27.84
you can't even tell. But he's constantly looking, look, and look, and look, and the girls are

2830
01:58:27.84 --> 01:58:33.04
gigland because it's, you know, it's kind of funny of them. I was like, it took me a long time to put that

2831
01:58:34.32 --> 01:58:38.08
picture together, what transpired. And I couldn't do it while I was in the field. You know,

2832
01:58:38.08 --> 01:58:41.92
I was like, it was just weird. I'm like, all right, that had to been a dude trying to find our

2833
01:58:41.92 --> 01:58:47.44
position and stress as a woman. And these dudes were just, they were cagey, man. We're out there

2834
01:58:47.44 --> 01:58:52.96
in the pop of sect on another mission. And it's mean another dude and we're set up in the hole.

2835
01:58:52.96 --> 01:58:58.40
And I remember I'm looking in a guy's looking at looking directly at us. But he's got like a

2836
01:58:58.40 --> 01:59:02.08
three or four year old girl right next to him. But he's looking in our direction. I'm like,

2837
01:59:02.08 --> 01:59:06.24
that shouldn't right. But he's got no gun. He's like two, three hundred yards away. I'm keeping

2838
01:59:06.24 --> 01:59:11.76
my on him. Watching, watching, watching, watching nothing happens. Me and the other guy rotate out of

2839
01:59:11.76 --> 01:59:15.44
the hole. He gets in there and shit five minutes after he gets in the hole. We just started,

2840
01:59:15.44 --> 01:59:19.44
you know, get, get, get, get into the hole, man. And like I'm young. Let's do a lot of there.

2841
01:59:19.44 --> 01:59:23.92
You know, he rolls out, but they're shit flying everywhere. You know, and we're like, damn,

2842
01:59:23.92 --> 01:59:28.56
that was close. Look at that dude. And you get it. You know? But that guy was spotting with his daughter.

2843
01:59:29.12 --> 01:59:34.80
Yeah. If it even was his daughter. Yeah. Oh, yes. Spotting with a child. Spotting grabbed out.

2844
01:59:34.80 --> 01:59:39.44
So, yeah, hold my hand. Come over here. Boom. Yeah. And if the guy had a gun,

2845
01:59:40.80 --> 01:59:44.000
I had a felt comfortable taking the shop. But he doesn't have anything. So you're just like,

2846
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.68
is this just more weird shit going on over here? There's somebody weird thing going on. Yeah.

2847
01:59:47.68 --> 01:59:51.28
There's always been all the weird inexplicable things that are happening all the time.

2848
01:59:51.28 --> 01:59:56.64
Yeah. And they're all looking freaking crazy suspicious. Yeah. I mean, we had a ISR asset one time

2849
01:59:56.64 --> 02:00:02.96
over, go flying overhead. Like there's a fast mover or something. And he's like, okay, we got,

2850
02:00:02.96 --> 02:00:06.96
we got a vehicle pulling up. Like we got a vehicle. So everyone's looking at this vehicle. I'm looking

2851
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:12.96
at this vehicle on the ISR screen. And like, it's this, this looks super suspect. They're stopping.

2852
02:00:12.96 --> 02:00:16.72
They're looking around. They get out. Yeah. Open the trunk. All right. Oh, they're opening the trunk.

2853
02:00:16.72 --> 02:00:21.60
You know, everyone's on this mode. And then the reaching the point, something out, the point,

2854
02:00:21.60 --> 02:00:25.28
something out. The point out. The point out an object right now. And sure enough, like,

2855
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:28.88
everyone's all excited and thinking, this is like, we need to drop a bomb on this thing. And sure

2856
02:00:28.88 --> 02:00:34.24
enough, they got out of jack out of the thing and jacked up their freaking car and changed the tire

2857
02:00:34.24 --> 02:00:39.20
and put it all away and left. And like they tracked them, they're, they left. They weren't,

2858
02:00:39.20 --> 02:00:47.44
it wasn't like a setup, you know? And, and man, it's so difficult to decipher what's

2859
02:00:47.44 --> 02:00:54.72
really happening. And you get better at it. But it's a tough war to fight. You know, it's a tough

2860
02:00:54.72 --> 02:00:58.56
war to fight. You know, like, I don't know what we turned over with you guys. You always talked about the

2861
02:00:58.56 --> 02:01:03.44
hey, it was a good shoot, bad result. Hey, what they're doing is lined up with the enemy

2862
02:01:03.44 --> 02:01:10.08
procedures. You build the story and you make the best decision you can with what you're looking at.

2863
02:01:10.80 --> 02:01:14.40
And sometimes just your point. It's actually legitimate. But you don't know that, you know?

2864
02:01:14.40 --> 02:01:21.04
Yeah, well, that was something I learned and stole from the first the 506 because we had,

2865
02:01:21.60 --> 02:01:26.000
or they, when we, when we first got there and we were over with them and they had some one of

2866
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.08
their guys shot and killed somebody and they were like, the person was out.

2867
02:01:30.08 --> 02:01:35.36
I forget what suspicious activity they were doing. But it was like they were digging a hole on the

2868
02:01:35.36 --> 02:01:40.24
side of the road and they shot, killed the guy and then they sent a team out there to inspect and he was

2869
02:01:40.24 --> 02:01:45.44
whatever, you know, he was planting a plant. I don't know what he was doing. But it was something that

2870
02:01:45.44 --> 02:01:52.40
was not the activity that that the shooter thought it was. Yeah. And I was talking to their

2871
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:56.000
ops officer and he was like, hey, you know what, this is a, this is a good shot, bad result,

2872
02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:03.52
meaning that the, our soldier was following the proper rules of engagement. And it turns out that

2873
02:02:04.24 --> 02:02:09.92
the result of that shot is bad, even though the shot was good, the result was bad. And, you know,

2874
02:02:09.92 --> 02:02:15.68
it bothers me so much when I hear people talk about, you know, these, the US military, you know,

2875
02:02:15.68 --> 02:02:20.24
causing all these civilian casualties, man, we go through such great lengths to prevent civilian

2876
02:02:20.24 --> 02:02:28.000
casualties and put our soldiers, sailors, airmen of a marine at such risk to prevent those

2877
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.52
casualties to civilian casualties from happen happening. But it does happen. That's the reality

2878
02:02:33.52 --> 02:02:37.84
that it's going to happen. And that's why if you're going to go to war, you better be ready for that.

2879
02:02:37.84 --> 02:02:42.32
Yeah. You can't go to war thinking, oh, yeah, don't worry. We won't kill any civilians. Like,

2880
02:02:42.32 --> 02:02:48.24
no, if you go to war, you're killing civilians. Yeah. I'm trying to think I know in the other

2881
02:02:48.24 --> 02:02:52.96
deployments I did over there. We started doing a lot of collateral damage assessments before we

2882
02:02:52.96 --> 02:02:56.80
did anything. I don't remember doing that one. We're in Romadi. Like, because we weren't really

2883
02:02:56.80 --> 02:03:04.000
dropping bombs. And there was mostly just ground, um, ground units, handling business, you know,

2884
02:03:04.96 --> 02:03:10.000
but anyways, that, that became a factor later on. Sure, everything was a CD. Yeah. I mean, even

2885
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.20
even even when I relieved you and Baghdad, we started looking at collateral damage in terms of

2886
02:03:15.20 --> 02:03:19.60
like breaching. Yeah. Like, okay, we're going to breach this building. What's the collateral damage?

2887
02:03:19.60 --> 02:03:24.88
Could we hurt someone? Yeah. Can we, are we going to ruin this? You know, how many, how many

2888
02:03:24.88 --> 02:03:28.40
wind shields are we going, or how many wind does in this neighborhood are we going to blow out

2889
02:03:28.40 --> 02:03:35.36
with this explosive breaching charge? And what good does that do for our overall strategic mission here

2890
02:03:35.36 --> 02:03:39.60
if we're the assholes that come in every night and blow up everyone's house and windows, right?

2891
02:03:39.60 --> 02:03:44.56
Yeah. All of a sudden, we're not cool. Yeah. So sometimes it was like, oh, okay, well,

2892
02:03:44.56 --> 02:03:47.52
maybe we shouldn't explicitly breach well, then how are you going to execute the mission?

2893
02:03:47.52 --> 02:03:51.20
And what risk does it put the troops at? Yeah. Because the safest way to do a direct action

2894
02:03:51.20 --> 02:03:55.92
mission is to explosively breach the shit out of them. Yeah. Yeah. Shock everyone in the building.

2895
02:03:55.92 --> 02:04:03.04
And by, okay, cool. So there's other tactics that we had to develop to to mitigate the risk. But

2896
02:04:03.04 --> 02:04:08.000
what I'm saying is we were taking risks for sure to try and mitigate and not just us every,

2897
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.72
I'm going to say, we, I mean, the US military at large,

2898
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:18.32
mitigates risk of civilian casualties by risking our own casualties. That's what we do.

2899
02:04:19.36 --> 02:04:24.16
And even as much as we mitigate them, we can't mitigate them all. And civilians are going to die.

2900
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:31.52
So you need to think about that. Yeah. So how to, when you guys had that horrific incident with

2901
02:04:31.52 --> 02:04:37.36
Elliot and Joe, then what? Then like, how did the rest of the deployment? And I know that you guys,

2902
02:04:37.36 --> 02:04:42.40
so one thing that's really positive is, part of this transition, I don't even know if you knew this.

2903
02:04:42.40 --> 02:04:50.56
So we were doing everything we could. We, that whole sons of Ambar and that whole thing started when

2904
02:04:50.56 --> 02:04:56.88
we were there. And then the other thing we were trying to do is we were trying to get the Iraqi police

2905
02:04:56.88 --> 02:05:04.000
force built up. And we just started to get it built as we left. And so you guys got the benefit

2906
02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:11.04
of the Iraqi police force, all of a sudden, the local Iraqi police force was respected. They were

2907
02:05:11.04 --> 02:05:16.32
manned. They had, they, they understood the neighborhoods. They were tribal, most of the guys were

2908
02:05:16.32 --> 02:05:23.84
tribal guys. And so all of a sudden, over a very quick period of time, the, the violence went down a lot.

2909
02:05:23.84 --> 02:05:28.72
Joe, absolutely. Absolutely. I remember the police became a huge factor. I think it was late

2910
02:05:28.72 --> 02:05:33.44
January, early February for us. They came in. They were setting up their own police stations and combat

2911
02:05:33.44 --> 02:05:39.04
outpost. But man, then they were targeted by a queue. You may need to head police chief. They're trying

2912
02:05:39.04 --> 02:05:45.44
to car bomb him and his entire family. They eventually got him. But it was, it was rough. And it

2913
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:52.96
definitely settled down everything. I would say, and by the, you know, mid, mid January to February,

2914
02:05:52.96 --> 02:05:57.68
somewhere in there is where things really settled and good. Where, hey, the attacks are going

2915
02:05:57.68 --> 02:06:02.88
way down. You know, we're still getting the occasional ID, you know, ID at him, you know, an army,

2916
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:09.60
silver affairs. They're going down to freaking Falcon and boom, they hit an ID killed our full

2917
02:06:09.60 --> 02:06:15.92
people. Oh, yeah, that was, that was Travis Patrickwin. And he was a freaking epic guy. That, and that

2918
02:06:15.92 --> 02:06:22.32
was a major McClellan, the female Marine Corps officer. Because they were there when I was there.

2919
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:28.16
They were both just freaking awesome. Awesome. Just awesome. Unbelievable. That was such a freaking

2920
02:06:28.16 --> 02:06:33.68
horrific situation. Yeah, absolutely horrible. But thanks definitely die down there towards,

2921
02:06:33.68 --> 02:06:40.72
you know, January, February, time, prime. It was in a good place. Then you read a poll. You came

2922
02:06:40.72 --> 02:06:44.72
back to America. Came back to America in boom. I'm going to work for Jockel Willi.

2923
02:06:44.72 --> 02:06:52.24
It's raining. Rolled in the trade that man. And that was, um, that was awesome. Yeah. That was awesome.

2924
02:06:52.24 --> 02:06:55.84
Did you, did you volunteer to come there or what happened? How did you guys so before the

2925
02:06:55.84 --> 02:07:00.000
plumbing, I know I was working with our group CMC and they were doing team level detailing.

2926
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.20
So he came in. He's like, hey, man, what do you want to do? I was like, well, I want to stay

2927
02:07:03.20 --> 02:07:06.80
out. I want to stay in the area. He's like, what would you think about going to trade? I was like,

2928
02:07:06.80 --> 02:07:10.40
keep me in the area. He was like, yeah, I was like, hell, yeah, I'll do it. So Roger that, man.

2929
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:16.40
I was looking forward to, you know, and you know, the guy I really do with their BJs is a good

2930
02:07:16.40 --> 02:07:22.72
dude smart and I think he set up a good foundation with what he had. So I inherited a really

2931
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:29.92
a good product. Yeah. He was doing good shit. Yeah, no, it was, it was legit. And then you showed up.

2932
02:07:29.92 --> 02:07:38.08
It was awesome. And then I mean, what was your experience of trade at like in terms of C now?

2933
02:07:38.08 --> 02:07:44.32
This is interesting. You know, I told you that like the seeds of my experience in knowledge were

2934
02:07:44.32 --> 02:07:51.28
watered heavily and fertilized heavily, but I was young. So now you get to experience this in a much

2935
02:07:52.48 --> 02:07:57.04
in a much more powerful environment because the training we were conducting was so much more advanced.

2936
02:07:58.48 --> 02:08:03.12
Then and also you were more advanced and you were a combat veteran of multiple combat

2937
02:08:03.12 --> 02:08:08.64
tours and you were a senior and listed guy. So man, it was just, it was awesome. It was a good experience.

2938
02:08:08.64 --> 02:08:11.92
But I'll tell you what I went in there and I'm like, holy, it's different when you're

2939
02:08:12.72 --> 02:08:18.16
responsible for a live fire range versus you're going through a live fire range.

2940
02:08:19.04 --> 02:08:23.52
And so there was, there was a lot to that, you know, the most stressful thing for me during

2941
02:08:23.52 --> 02:08:27.68
land warfare was doing all the live fire training because there was definitely a lot of opportunity

2942
02:08:27.68 --> 02:08:32.96
for someone to get injured or wounded, you know, you know what I mean. And so it was good

2943
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:37.68
and getting up there and teaching these things, you just learned so much more. I mean, the pipeline

2944
02:08:37.68 --> 02:08:42.96
should be, we need guys and instructor positions, but you need them a budget. You also need them over

2945
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:49.60
at our trade at that. If there was a way to split that where they do 15 months, it bugs, 15 months

2946
02:08:49.60 --> 02:08:55.44
a trade, it would be ideal. It's just, it's not practical, you know. But going to trade, it was an

2947
02:08:55.44 --> 02:09:01.68
eye open. And I really started, you know, I'd say around 2003 I started 2003-2004,

2948
02:09:01.68 --> 02:09:06.32
started reading quite a bit. I never heard of the last hundred yards. You know, we didn't have

2949
02:09:06.32 --> 02:09:10.64
a portal with libraries. We didn't have guys going around if you went in a training so you might see it.

2950
02:09:11.36 --> 02:09:16.48
But I really started building up a good reading block. And I remember talking to you when we're at

2951
02:09:16.48 --> 02:09:21.68
trade at, and we were reading, I think I just went through the maneuver of warfare handbook. And I was like,

2952
02:09:21.68 --> 02:09:27.20
man, I'm thinking these things. And then you read it in a reinforces what you were thinking. So

2953
02:09:27.20 --> 02:09:33.20
not, now your confidence just goes through the roof. And I think one of the things we did good in

2954
02:09:34.08 --> 02:09:38.48
in a stubby of continues to do this is developing our future leaders. I mean, think about when

2955
02:09:38.48 --> 02:09:42.80
you and I came up with it. There was no portal, there was no none of this stuff. We've got stuff

2956
02:09:42.80 --> 02:09:47.52
hanging. Hey, you want to be a good tactical leader, leader, go read your doctrine, go read these

2957
02:09:47.52 --> 02:09:51.92
books here, and that is going to boost you up. And the guys that are hungry, they're going to

2958
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:55.44
go in there and read it. The guys that are, you know, a little bit lax a days ago and they don't want to

2959
02:09:55.44 --> 02:09:59.28
do it. They're going to meet the minimum standard. But you definitely need to have something out there

2960
02:09:59.28 --> 02:10:04.88
to wear, you know, your high performers are hungry, give it to them so that they can become,

2961
02:10:06.08 --> 02:10:10.56
a better leader. So I think we did that good, but just going back to land war for, I think,

2962
02:10:10.56 --> 02:10:14.96
you know, the stress levels, they were high during a life-iron training, the field training exercises

2963
02:10:14.96 --> 02:10:20.64
we did were just badass were building, you know, little wood huts all over the dam place on those ranges.

2964
02:10:20.64 --> 02:10:26.000
And I think the guys, you know, I mean, shit, we had a thermal camera out there at one point and we're

2965
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:29.76
video tape in the guys coming in so they come back and go through their debrief, we're going,

2966
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:33.60
this is what you all look like. Here's what we're telling you. Here's what you look like and the people

2967
02:10:33.60 --> 02:10:37.12
see what they look like. They go damn check, Roger that, you know, they're making some adjustments.

2968
02:10:38.08 --> 02:10:42.24
But I thought it was good. I was definitely learning a lot while was there. I wish I had

2969
02:10:42.24 --> 02:10:48.80
a done that assignment earlier on in, in at least a team five training. So I would have boosted me up a lot,

2970
02:10:48.80 --> 02:10:56.16
you know, what did you see? What did you notice from the, I mean, the crazy thing about it is you get

2971
02:10:56.16 --> 02:11:04.56
to, it's the best lat, I truly think this. I think that that land warfare training is the best

2972
02:11:04.56 --> 02:11:08.40
leadership laboratory in the world. I think that's it. I don't think there's a better leadership

2973
02:11:08.40 --> 02:11:14.40
laboratory where you can see leadership in action. I really don't because you get the whole dynamic,

2974
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:22.40
someone might say, well, you know, in some business or in some bureaucratic situation or some

2975
02:11:22.40 --> 02:11:26.000
boardroom, you get that part too because you get the mission planning that's taking place. And

2976
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.72
there's no gunfire going on during the mission planning, but you get the stress that you get the

2977
02:11:30.72 --> 02:11:34.48
people that have to make decisions, you get the team arguing with each other, and you get the

2978
02:11:34.48 --> 02:11:40.000
different personalities that are coming out. And so you get to watch all this and you get to learn and

2979
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:44.32
you get to see how people react and you get to see human nature over and over and over again.

2980
02:11:44.32 --> 02:11:51.36
And you get to see one puttune do it. And then you see another puttune do the same thing. The same,

2981
02:11:51.36 --> 02:11:57.60
I mean, we had all those little pet nickmames for all the different maneuvers that we knew that

2982
02:11:57.60 --> 02:12:04.48
our moush was going to do. And we, so you'd see a puttune go through the octopus, you'd see a puttune

2983
02:12:04.48 --> 02:12:11.04
go through the corner of death, right? You'd see the trail of tears. You'd get to see how they would

2984
02:12:11.04 --> 02:12:16.24
react and you'd see what a good leader would do. And you'd see how that would turn the puttune and

2985
02:12:16.24 --> 02:12:21.20
all the sudden they'd be able to get things together and survive and make it happen and do a good

2986
02:12:21.20 --> 02:12:25.60
job. And you'd see bad leadership. And you'd go, well, these guys are just going to be a

2987
02:12:25.60 --> 02:12:34.24
suffer fest. And so that that leadership laboratory was just unbelievably powerful. And really,

2988
02:12:34.24 --> 02:12:40.72
it was, it was powerful for for us as instructors because we were detached and we got to watch it.

2989
02:12:40.72 --> 02:12:46.16
Look, the troops, Abby, obviously, get a ton out of it too. But getting to see it over and over again

2990
02:12:46.16 --> 02:12:53.92
was just ridiculous amount of learning. One of the things I, I really respected about land warfare,

2991
02:12:54.56 --> 02:12:59.20
you got to see people's true character when they're coming through there, they're up late at night,

2992
02:12:59.20 --> 02:13:03.68
you're under a lot of stress, whatever you're thinking in your head or whatever type of attitude

2993
02:13:03.68 --> 02:13:07.68
you have, good or bad, that's coming out. And you really get to see what you're working with with

2994
02:13:07.68 --> 02:13:14.000
your pertune, you know. And that's a good precursor because when you go to combat, if you end up

2995
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.40
going on deployment and you end up getting in real combat, you're going to see that, that's the only

2996
02:13:18.40 --> 02:13:22.96
place that's going to come out even more is when you go into combat, people start acting crazy.

2997
02:13:22.96 --> 02:13:27.04
Like, and I'm not talking about hey, and gunfight, there, and I'm talking about on a day-to-day

2998
02:13:27.04 --> 02:13:32.32
basis, you start seeing what their character is. They do, they want to operate, do, they want to

2999
02:13:32.32 --> 02:13:36.80
hide, do, they will, like you get to see, start to see all that stuff. And you'll see it,

3000
02:13:36.80 --> 02:13:42.32
you'll see it out in the desert, in training, you'll see people start to crack, and you'll also see

3001
02:13:42.32 --> 02:13:46.64
people step up and you'll see people start to lead and you see people that are tough. And when you

3002
02:13:46.64 --> 02:13:50.32
see those good leaders coming through and look, the good leader could be anyone in the platoon from

3003
02:13:50.32 --> 02:13:58.40
an E5 to the platoon or the task unit commander, anyone in between, you have one good leader or two

3004
02:13:58.40 --> 02:14:04.08
good leaders in there and they're going to do a good job. They can be countered by bad leadership.

3005
02:14:04.08 --> 02:14:10.08
So you can have a good leader that gets countered by someone that's an ego jackass and they that

3006
02:14:10.08 --> 02:14:14.80
ego jackass can actually ruin everything. Sometimes if you just have one good leader, that's the

3007
02:14:14.80 --> 02:14:20.48
LPL of one platoon, and he's a really good sol leader, he can carry the whole task unit.

3008
02:14:21.52 --> 02:14:26.96
Now if you put a jackass, just seen your chief in there, a jackass chief or a jackass lieutenant,

3009
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:33.68
he can he can override two or three squared away leaders because he's a knucklehead and doesn't

3010
02:14:33.68 --> 02:14:38.40
want a lesson and wants to do everything his way and wants to let his ego run the show.

3011
02:14:38.40 --> 02:14:45.28
The freaking disaster. Yeah, we saw quite a few good leaders come through, probably the most

3012
02:14:45.28 --> 02:14:49.28
rewarding thing, having guys come through training, they're coming through, they're just starting out

3013
02:14:50.40 --> 02:14:54.40
as a unit. They're figuring out some things out if they haven't been through another block

3014
02:14:54.96 --> 02:15:00.16
and they come in and the growth that you see, that you're providing as instructors and you know

3015
02:15:00.16 --> 02:15:05.28
as a cadre, as a unit and you see him start here and by the time they finish after that

3016
02:15:05.28 --> 02:15:10.96
three, four weeks, they're up here, 100%. The growth is tremendous and guess what, the

3017
02:15:10.96 --> 02:15:15.44
heart of the trainer, the heart of the training, the more the guys appreciate it, the more growth

3018
02:15:15.44 --> 02:15:20.80
you have. That's what I physically saw happening with with our formation.

3019
02:15:21.60 --> 02:15:26.56
Yeah, because it was miserable. Yes, it was freaking miserable. It was freaking hard. When you're

3020
02:15:26.56 --> 02:15:34.88
carrying out, I mean, if a platoon did a bad job, they'd have 12 down men. They'd be carrying out

3021
02:15:34.88 --> 02:15:40.72
12 down men for three or four kilometers before they could finally get a helicopter in there

3022
02:15:40.72 --> 02:15:44.32
to pick up and take the wounded, then they still got to walk, the rest of them got to walk out.

3023
02:15:44.32 --> 02:15:48.64
Like when you got your ass kicked, you got your ass kicked and it would sometimes,

3024
02:15:50.08 --> 02:15:55.04
you know, that was another big difference when a leader, when the leadership in the task unit

3025
02:15:55.04 --> 02:15:59.36
or in the platoon would say, would come back and say, hey, we screwed up. We better fix it.

3026
02:16:00.08 --> 02:16:05.92
They would fix it. If the kick, if they came back and said, oh, trade at cheating or trade at,

3027
02:16:05.92 --> 02:16:10.16
this is this this training is unrealistic. If they said that, they wouldn't improve. And they just

3028
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:16.24
follow a part. But when they say, hey, we spent too much time on target. Hey, we didn't cover

3029
02:16:16.24 --> 02:16:22.32
move or hey, we didn't give the priorities correctly or we didn't have. When they came back and said

3030
02:16:22.32 --> 02:16:29.68
that, recognize that they'd come out in a good task unit by the end, our trade at guys couldn't

3031
02:16:29.68 --> 02:16:33.44
keep under wraps. Like, they would get the the trade at guys we get their ass's kicked.

3032
02:16:33.44 --> 02:16:37.36
Because there's, because there's 40 of the back, I mean, 40 of the of the platoon guys.

3033
02:16:37.92 --> 02:16:42.56
So they could freaking, when they would do good cover move, you can't stop them.

3034
02:16:42.56 --> 02:16:46.64
No. They're unstoppable. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's what I always tell people, hey, man,

3035
02:16:46.64 --> 02:16:51.68
the people who utilize the laws of combat did good cover and move kept things simple, good

3036
02:16:51.68 --> 02:16:55.92
communications across board, prioritizing executed, stayed detached from what was going on

3037
02:16:56.64 --> 02:17:00.24
in the guys that utilize decentralized command, whether they'll allow fire team leaders and

3038
02:17:00.24 --> 02:17:04.64
squad leaders to make decisions at their level. Because you can't be everywhere as the boss

3039
02:17:04.64 --> 02:17:10.40
making these decisions. You got to train your, you got to train your, your leaders up, put up some

3040
02:17:10.40 --> 02:17:14.72
guard wells, get them to where they need to be. And then you let them start making decisions, you know.

3041
02:17:14.72 --> 02:17:17.92
And that's probably like one of the most beautiful things with land warfare.

3042
02:17:17.92 --> 02:17:22.16
Guys are going out there, they're learning these things and they're slowly building their

3043
02:17:22.16 --> 02:17:26.000
confidence to where when they get to the field training exercise, we can start making some of

3044
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.84
these decisions, then it's even that much more of a confidence builder, you know.

3045
02:17:31.04 --> 02:17:38.64
It's weird because you can, you can, I mean, look, I would explain this stuff.

3046
02:17:39.20 --> 02:17:43.36
Ad knows you, right? Ad knows you. I mean, I would explain it and explain, I'd say, look,

3047
02:17:43.36 --> 02:17:46.72
you got to do that. You got to do this. You got to do this. But sometimes, man,

3048
02:17:46.72 --> 02:17:54.24
it would just take like it happening to someone. And being, and me sitting there like

3049
02:17:54.24 --> 02:18:00.40
literally running over to a fire team leader and saying, hey, what are you doing? Those guys are

3050
02:18:00.40 --> 02:18:03.60
freaking running right now. You got to get them down. You got to put down cover five of them

3051
02:18:03.60 --> 02:18:08.40
and then I'm going, oh, wait a second, I get it. And then you'd see this light come on,

3052
02:18:08.40 --> 02:18:12.88
or I'd run up to a freaking task. You'd a commander and be like, where do you want everyone to

3053
02:18:12.88 --> 02:18:17.76
go right now? What do you want everyone to do? And he'd say, we need to get out of here. Okay,

3054
02:18:17.76 --> 02:18:23.36
what direction? I said, are you going to be able to move everyone out of here? No. Can you think

3055
02:18:23.36 --> 02:18:28.16
your fire teams can start moving? Yes, tell them where you want them to move. Just tell them all,

3056
02:18:28.16 --> 02:18:32.64
and they'll start making it happen. And you could see the little, like all of a sudden, the

3057
02:18:32.64 --> 02:18:39.04
light would come on. But sometimes it would just take that, like you have to live, you almost have

3058
02:18:39.04 --> 02:18:44.16
to live through it. In some cases, some guys would be like, yeah, got it. Cover move, check, got it.

3059
02:18:44.16 --> 02:18:49.20
Because you learn cover move day one or the day one of the teams, you learn cover move. You better

3060
02:18:49.20 --> 02:18:54.64
freaking cover move. Yeah, sometimes it took a guy's a little while to figure out how to utilize

3061
02:18:54.64 --> 02:18:59.76
the train correctly. You know, because the train was a, was a factor of Rockies, small waddies,

3062
02:19:00.88 --> 02:19:04.24
uneven terrain, which was hard to maneuver, especially when you got a downman.

3063
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:14.56
There was something there too. To train, to rain is the, is the next level. Right? The next

3064
02:19:14.56 --> 02:19:20.96
level is, oh, I don't just know how to cover move. I just don't know simple. I just don't know

3065
02:19:20.96 --> 02:19:26.72
prioritize next. Cute. I don't just know decentralized command. I know how to utilize the terrain

3066
02:19:26.72 --> 02:19:32.80
to my advantage. That's the next level up. That's the next level up. When you realize, oh,

3067
02:19:32.80 --> 02:19:35.92
I can get a little high ground. Oh, there's a little dead space. Oh, there's a ravine over here.

3068
02:19:35.92 --> 02:19:40.40
I can get the guys out. That's the next level. And we tried to teach it in that method. You know,

3069
02:19:40.40 --> 02:19:45.36
you start off doing I ads in a flat spot. And then all of a sudden you start to get used to rain.

3070
02:19:45.36 --> 02:19:52.16
But when the leadership, when the, when the, when the whole task unit, when a fire team leader

3071
02:19:52.16 --> 02:19:56.48
knows how to use terrain. And then all the fire team leaders know how to use terrain. All of a sudden

3072
02:19:56.48 --> 02:20:03.92
we're in a whole different spot. Yeah. We're in a whole different spot. So yes, the terrain is so freaking

3073
02:20:03.92 --> 02:20:10.000
critical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. A little bit of high ground. Yeah. We had guys down on that

3074
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:17.52
micro tray. Doing good things. Yeah. Tough stuff on the body. And we had, I mean, we had rain,

3075
02:20:17.52 --> 02:20:21.76
we had Rangers out there helping us. Oh, which was awesome. Do those guys, they brought a lot.

3076
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:27.04
And the, the Rangers, we had out there. They had all kinds of both of them came from leadership

3077
02:20:27.04 --> 02:20:32.24
assignments within their, their Ranger unit. And they had a lot of reps, man. They brought a lot to

3078
02:20:32.24 --> 02:20:35.52
the table. They had all kinds of good info. We were eating it. We were just like,

3079
02:20:35.52 --> 02:20:41.12
Com, stand by keep it coming. Keep it coming. Yeah. It's always, it's one of the, the worse,

3080
02:20:41.12 --> 02:20:44.64
one of the bad things. One of the worse things about the, the seal teams is,

3081
02:20:44.64 --> 02:20:52.80
we don't come from an infantry background. Yeah. You know, we're not soldiers. We're not infantry.

3082
02:20:52.80 --> 02:20:58.16
We're, we're, so we don't have that skill set. And you can get lucky and you can get a brush

3083
02:20:58.16 --> 02:21:03.20
up against it. I got, I got at least brushed up against it. Doing orgs with the Marines and being like,

3084
02:21:03.20 --> 02:21:09.92
okay, I at least understand what an infantry platoon is. Yeah. Because if you regular seal,

3085
02:21:09.92 --> 02:21:13.44
new guy, you don't know what the hell an infantry platoon is. You have no idea. You think a

3086
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:18.96
platoon is 16 guys, you know, they're a platoon. But, but yeah, so those, so in the army,

3087
02:21:19.52 --> 02:21:22.88
you have that infantry background. In the Marine Corps, you have that infantry background. It's

3088
02:21:22.88 --> 02:21:27.52
so helpful. So having like, Rangers out there with us who were freaking great guys, by the way,

3089
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:34.24
and they bring that that infantry background. And they were stoked too. They were, they freaking

3090
02:21:34.24 --> 02:21:38.40
luck. They loved our trading. Yeah. They were awesome. The both of those guys had a lot of reps

3091
02:21:38.40 --> 02:21:43.12
in half canis 10. I'm trying to remember right. And I know where the, the one guy came in and he was

3092
02:21:43.12 --> 02:21:50.80
really tightening up our helicopter procedures. Just, you know, you covered so much like damn

3093
02:21:50.80 --> 02:21:54.72
I didn't even think about that. You know, all my deployments were to Iraq at that point.

3094
02:21:55.60 --> 02:22:01.36
But yeah, good dudes, man. Did you read about face back then? Oh, yes. So I read it when I got to

3095
02:22:01.36 --> 02:22:07.68
trade it. You know, you had that as your Bible. Damn, what was the guy's name? I had them in here.

3096
02:22:07.68 --> 02:22:18.72
There was another kernel that he's got a page on four page for something in about face. But the guy

3097
02:22:18.72 --> 02:22:23.76
was just a beast. Oh, Glover Jones. That's him. Yeah. And that guy had so many good nuggets on the

3098
02:22:23.76 --> 02:22:29.28
page and a half. Yeah. Yeah. But I remember reading through that page 402 half worth. And he just has

3099
02:22:29.28 --> 02:22:33.76
some nuggets. And there's got like 15 things that he covers. You know, strive to do small things. Well,

3100
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:40.72
be a doer in a self-starter. You know, the one that I always hit home with me because I think it's so true

3101
02:22:40.72 --> 02:22:46.24
is what is it? The two, you know, in order to be a good, two good characteristics of the leaders.

3102
02:22:46.24 --> 02:22:52.32
You've got to be a good communicator and you've got to be a good writer. And the writing piece

3103
02:22:52.32 --> 02:22:56.40
comes into play as you start moving up in your upper level, leadership and management positions

3104
02:22:56.40 --> 02:23:00.96
because you're writing e-vowels for the guys. And I remember being at trade it and you were kind of like,

3105
02:23:00.96 --> 02:23:07.36
hey, man, if you guys bring me an e-vow in the thing requires minor or requires major surgery,

3106
02:23:07.36 --> 02:23:12.56
I'm only going to be able to do so much to it to make it better. But you bring me an e-vow that's

3107
02:23:12.56 --> 02:23:16.56
dialed in pretty damn tight. I'm going to get it over the line. It's going to be a beautiful piece of

3108
02:23:16.56 --> 02:23:21.44
work. It's going to be a piece of art. And you're getting into people shit on it. You, you were not a

3109
02:23:21.44 --> 02:23:26.24
happy camper because there was like always e-vowels coming in. Yeah. But it's so true when you think about it.

3110
02:23:26.24 --> 02:23:31.36
Hey, how do we take care of people? A-way is in through our evaluation system. Making sure the

3111
02:23:31.36 --> 02:23:36.40
right people are getting promoted and through awards, those all require some type of writing skill.

3112
02:23:36.40 --> 02:23:41.84
Right. One, freaking series, one year of evaluations, probably the first year that you were there.

3113
02:23:43.04 --> 02:23:48.96
The shit that you guys turned in. And I had no choice. I didn't get them till two late. And I just

3114
02:23:48.96 --> 02:23:54.32
had to, I just had to do nine days in my office just rewriting every single one of them. And that's why

3115
02:23:54.32 --> 02:24:03.12
the next year early. I said, hey, everyone, write me the e-vow for your best guy. And then I brought you guys

3116
02:24:03.12 --> 02:24:08.24
it. You were in this group right? I brought you guys into the, into the conference room and posted

3117
02:24:08.24 --> 02:24:15.44
them up all the screen. I made you guys read your sentences to me. And you guys were just like,

3118
02:24:16.32 --> 02:24:21.60
like the very first sentence that each guy read. It would just be like this blah, blah,

3119
02:24:21.60 --> 02:24:27.76
just a shit sentence. And I'd be like, all right, how does that sound? Like not good. But that

3120
02:24:27.76 --> 02:24:33.36
worked so well. Because then everyone realized, oh, I should actually read this stuff. I should

3121
02:24:33.36 --> 02:24:37.44
actually read it aloud to myself. I should actually see if these sentences make sense. And it just

3122
02:24:37.44 --> 02:24:43.44
helped everybody so, so it helped me. Because now you guys were all turning in square to way stuff

3123
02:24:43.44 --> 02:24:49.68
which then I could, what, what would you say turn into a piece of art? I know, I go quite go that far.

3124
02:24:49.68 --> 02:24:56.64
I believe in quotations of piece of art. Joccaloo. We got an artist on the net over here.

3125
02:24:57.76 --> 02:25:02.24
Glover Johns from Hackworth to and he wrote a book called The Clay Pigeons of St. Love,

3126
02:25:02.24 --> 02:25:06.40
which we covered on this podcast. And it's written. It's hard to tell because he wrote it in the third

3127
02:25:06.40 --> 02:25:12.64
person talking about himself as if he was a different person, but it's about him. Then it's a great

3128
02:25:12.64 --> 02:25:17.36
book and it gives all kinds of leadership lessons as well. One of the things I want to

3129
02:25:17.36 --> 02:25:21.36
camp out of real quick on, on Hackworth. One of the things is I was reading through that book and it

3130
02:25:21.36 --> 02:25:27.12
took me six months to get through it. It's a big book. But it really reinforced. You know, when you're

3131
02:25:27.12 --> 02:25:31.52
coming in is a leader, at any level, and you're new to that leadership assignment, you're always

3132
02:25:31.52 --> 02:25:36.56
uncomfortable. So you're trying to figure out am I making the right decision? And when you're going

3133
02:25:36.56 --> 02:25:40.88
through and you're reading some nonfiction that pertains to your field, your field craft,

3134
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.16
it just reinforces what you're thinking. And I remember after reading about face the maneuver

3135
02:25:46.16 --> 02:25:50.64
worth for a handbook, I came out of those like damn, a lot of these decisions I was uncertain about,

3136
02:25:50.64 --> 02:25:55.44
it reinforced that I was making the right decision. So how do you become better? You read that

3137
02:25:55.44 --> 02:26:00.24
stuff before you get those leadership positions. And who's responsible for, for destroying that

3138
02:26:00.24 --> 02:26:04.40
out, the leadership? You know, if you're in a leadership position out there, what are you doing to

3139
02:26:04.40 --> 02:26:10.40
develop your future leaders? You have people that want to take your job. What are you doing to

3140
02:26:10.40 --> 02:26:15.20
develop them? And you go, look across the world like we got COVID everywhere. You can get a car accident.

3141
02:26:15.20 --> 02:26:19.28
Who's the next person in line that's going to take your job? Who is that person? And what are you

3142
02:26:19.28 --> 02:26:23.04
doing to develop them? You know, we've gotten way better over the years in the military and in

3143
02:26:23.04 --> 02:26:27.28
a stubby doing this. Well, but let's think about that. That's pretty powerful. You know,

3144
02:26:27.28 --> 02:26:34.000
yeah, do J.P. sent because I gave, I gave a J.P. a copy of, at least I think I gave it to him.

3145
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.08
Anyways, he got a copy of the new addition of about face with the forwarding and everything. And so

3146
02:26:38.08 --> 02:26:47.28
he's like sending me highlighted passages and he's not happy. And he's like, bro, I cannot believe

3147
02:26:47.28 --> 02:26:54.88
that you didn't make me read this when I was a, you know, when I was 23 or 22. And I'm like,

3148
02:26:54.88 --> 02:26:58.80
dude, I'm sorry, like I'm a horrible leader because there's so much information in there.

3149
02:26:58.80 --> 02:27:06.88
And I just ripped it off wholesale, wholesale just ripped it off. And it's like, why didn't I

3150
02:27:06.88 --> 02:27:12.96
share that? And part of me was I just didn't think team guys had any desire to read anything,

3151
02:27:12.96 --> 02:27:19.52
you know, because most team guys didn't. Most team guys let me be here. You know what I did with my

3152
02:27:19.52 --> 02:27:25.20
about face when I got back over to when I got over to team seven, I gave it out to one of our younger

3153
02:27:25.20 --> 02:27:29.68
tactical. So that's like, like, that's a big book. I'm like, yes, you need to read that.

3154
02:27:30.24 --> 02:27:33.76
Did you? And then when you're done with it, you need to pass it on to someone else. Do you think you

3155
02:27:33.76 --> 02:27:39.20
read it? I don't know man. See, you take book. It's such a big book. I don't know. It's good. And here's the thing,

3156
02:27:39.20 --> 02:27:45.28
always talk about making hard calls. You look at those decisions he made in there. Those were,

3157
02:27:45.84 --> 02:27:50.48
he was going to be hated. He knew that going in. He didn't care. He knew what the right thing to do

3158
02:27:50.48 --> 02:27:55.44
was. He made the right calls. And you know, he wind up saving a lot of lives with his guys from

3159
02:27:55.44 --> 02:28:01.92
it. Yeah, we'll see. There's a little nuance there in what you said. He had to make hard calls.

3160
02:28:01.92 --> 02:28:09.20
He knew that he would be hated in the short term. He knew that there would be resistance. Yeah.

3161
02:28:09.20 --> 02:28:14.96
But he knew in the end he would be admired and he would be loved because he would be able to keep his

3162
02:28:14.96 --> 02:28:20.80
guys alive. And he knew that that what what would shine through is the fact that he cared about his

3163
02:28:20.80 --> 02:28:26.48
men. Yeah. That's what would shine through. And believe me, when we had General Mooka Yamon,

3164
02:28:26.48 --> 02:28:33.44
I was so, uh, not really worried, but like going into it. Here I'm going to meet a guy that

3165
02:28:33.44 --> 02:28:39.12
worked for Freak and Hack. And what is he going to say? Yeah. Like he's going to be like, well,

3166
02:28:39.12 --> 02:28:43.12
you know, Hack will made himself out to be a little bit more than he was or Hack talked to good

3167
02:28:43.12 --> 02:28:46.96
game, but that really wasn't the guy he was air. I didn't know what he was going to say. Yeah.

3168
02:28:46.96 --> 02:28:54.08
But dude, he was just 100% 100% Hack was the man. And he was a company commander when

3169
02:28:54.08 --> 02:28:58.40
Hack was a baton commander. I mean, that's the that's the leadership. Wow. So, you know,

3170
02:28:59.68 --> 02:29:03.68
what what you know and I said, did you know who Hack was? He was everybody knew who Hack was.

3171
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:12.000
And like that attitude and and I said, you know, what how did you, what was it that made

3172
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.20
he goes everything like the way he's carried himself, the way he looked, the way he had his head,

3173
02:29:17.20 --> 02:29:21.76
he had his hair, he's like he had his head shaved and he just looked like this guy's just freaking

3174
02:29:21.76 --> 02:29:27.04
square away from day one. But so you're going to make because because one thing I don't like

3175
02:29:27.04 --> 02:29:33.60
and Lafayne, I have talked about this on the podcast is the someone thinking, well, you know,

3176
02:29:33.60 --> 02:29:37.92
I'm in charge, so I'm going to be hated and that's okay. It's like, no, that's actually not okay.

3177
02:29:37.92 --> 02:29:42.24
If you're hated by your troops, that's a freaking problem. That means you're doing something wrong.

3178
02:29:43.12 --> 02:29:49.28
For your troops to take over a unit or take over a team or take over a position

3179
02:29:49.28 --> 02:29:52.40
and say, all right, we're going to start making some adjustments.

3180
02:29:53.44 --> 02:29:58.000
Now, one thing that's different to in Hack's case when he took over the 439, this he took over a

3181
02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.96
disaster, a known disaster. He had to come in there and kind of swing a hammer a little bit.

3182
02:30:02.96 --> 02:30:07.92
Oh, he had to bring out the flame throw. Yeah, he had to do some barbecue. He had to do some barbecue.

3183
02:30:08.48 --> 02:30:13.68
But he also eventually, you know, anyone would do anything. You know, like talking to General

3184
02:30:13.68 --> 02:30:17.44
Mucchial, those guys would do absolutely anything for happen. Anything. And even the freaking,

3185
02:30:17.44 --> 02:30:20.56
even the drafties would do anything for Hackworth. Like they loved them. Yeah.

3186
02:30:21.28 --> 02:30:24.88
And it's kind of like you said earlier, when people go through hard training, they appreciate it

3187
02:30:24.88 --> 02:30:30.08
and they love the training more. When you are disciplined with your troops, when you're hard on

3188
02:30:30.08 --> 02:30:36.80
your troops, they respect you and they respect themselves. And you start to get this camaraderie that you need.

3189
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.72
You know, I think a hack worth, I think of like you said a dude showing up right here, cut,

3190
02:30:42.72 --> 02:30:50.48
right uniform, just everything he's communicating lines up with his actions. And the guys just

3191
02:30:50.48 --> 02:30:54.16
had to be like, damn, does this guy do anything wrong? You know what I mean? Is he sweet?

3192
02:30:54.16 --> 02:30:58.16
Let's go on on with this dude. And then when you look at that, you're like, hey, my margin of air

3193
02:30:58.16 --> 02:31:03.44
is going to be small because this dude's doing everything he's saying. Yeah, you know, that's

3194
02:31:03.44 --> 02:31:08.16
powerful. That leadership, by example, that's how you got to roll 100%.

3195
02:31:08.16 --> 02:31:13.68
What, anything else from trade at? No, I was all good. Christmas in the desert.

3196
02:31:14.24 --> 02:31:20.08
Christmas in the desert. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So I remember, uh, nine-lin man, we were wrapping up.

3197
02:31:20.08 --> 02:31:25.44
And we had to, it was a good run. The troop came through good energy levels and we're getting ready to

3198
02:31:25.44 --> 02:31:31.68
go home. And you came and you said, that wasn't bad guys. And I was like, all right, let me put that

3199
02:31:31.68 --> 02:31:36.88
through my enlisted description device up here. What Jockel saying is, good job. Have a good

3200
02:31:36.88 --> 02:31:41.84
Christmas. He loves you all and you're like, oh, go, go, go. You gave a little chuckle out of there.

3201
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:45.84
So I got you kind of being hugged here there right before Christmas. The spirits were good.

3202
02:31:47.84 --> 02:31:51.52
So I said that wasn't bad. That's a, that's a good of a compliment as you're going to get out of

3203
02:31:51.52 --> 02:31:55.52
me. Yeah. I had to translate it for him. But yeah, let's check.

3204
02:31:57.60 --> 02:32:05.28
Maybe compliments weren't my strong point. They were not. I got some recordings of some of those

3205
02:32:05.28 --> 02:32:12.08
debriefs. Somebody's, somebody's hooking me up. One of one of my buddies. He just texted me a couple

3206
02:32:12.08 --> 02:32:17.84
weeks ago and he said, hey, somebody gave me recordings of your debriefs. He said, you're going to want

3207
02:32:17.84 --> 02:32:24.40
to hear him like, Chad. I remember being on Target out there. And this unit was maneuvering.

3208
02:32:24.96 --> 02:32:31.52
I forget what's happening. But one of the guys communication is so long. Hey, I need you to grab

3209
02:32:31.52 --> 02:32:35.68
your guys and move to the mountain like in Black Hawk down to like, what the hell? What don't you,

3210
02:32:35.68 --> 02:32:41.04
you know, what are you talking about there? It was just crazy talking. Yeah, just hit record on my voice

3211
02:32:41.04 --> 02:32:45.52
recorded during those things and play it back for people like listen to yourself. I think

3212
02:32:45.52 --> 02:32:49.12
you need to keep your stuff a little clearer. More simple clear and concise. I was keeping it

3213
02:32:49.12 --> 02:32:55.12
simple. Oh, really listen to this. Here's you telling your troops. Peel right. I need everyone to

3214
02:32:55.12 --> 02:33:00.80
blow, blow, blow, blow, blow. Freaking ridiculous. Yeah, yeah, freaking totally ridiculous. Yeah, yeah,

3215
02:33:00.80 --> 02:33:08.24
what was crazy. So then where'd you go? Yep. So after that, head back over to our headed two teams

3216
02:33:08.24 --> 02:33:12.000
seven and at that point it already made master chief. So I was going to there's the ops,

3217
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:18.16
master chief, senior listed guy and then I got pegged to do. So I went back there and what October

3218
02:33:18.16 --> 02:33:24.96
22,000 nine October, 20,000 nine just finished up the senior listed cadmium. They're like, hey,

3219
02:33:24.96 --> 02:33:29.28
those big one. They're trying to pump as many people as they can over an Afghanistan. So I got hit

3220
02:33:29.28 --> 02:33:34.72
with a joint individual augment headed out to a small outstation out in Afghanistan. I was the senior

3221
02:33:34.72 --> 02:33:39.68
listed leader out there, which was a good experience. So the first time at that point where I

3222
02:33:39.68 --> 02:33:46.08
really worked in a joint environment. So my boss was a full bird colonel. He was SF dude. Good guy

3223
02:33:46.08 --> 02:33:50.16
learned a lot from him. He'd been in like 32 years. He was prior and listed and worked as we have

3224
02:33:50.16 --> 02:33:56.72
to the right. He's just a salty old dog. And then we had the army air force, Marine Corps out there

3225
02:33:56.72 --> 02:34:02.56
everyone. And then we had quite a few military officers from different countries. We had Afghanistan

3226
02:34:02.56 --> 02:34:10.24
and a few other surrounding countries in there. And our primary goal was to fusion until. And then

3227
02:34:10.24 --> 02:34:15.84
we had some reconnaissance platforms up overhead and they were doing their stuff. And

3228
02:34:15.84 --> 02:34:22.08
some other countries. But it was good. And that was the first time I really appreciated our special

3229
02:34:22.08 --> 02:34:27.12
forces unit. And I was working with another senior listed leader. He was in another country.

3230
02:34:27.12 --> 02:34:30.88
And he's like, hey man, here's what we got going on. I mean, and we'd communicate back and forth,

3231
02:34:30.88 --> 02:34:36.88
you know, like once or twice a week. And he's like, hey, I got my SF Italian. We're training up this.

3232
02:34:36.88 --> 02:34:41.04
And he's like, here's our numbers. And I was like, hey, wait a minute. You guys have this many,

3233
02:34:41.04 --> 02:34:48.08
you know, ODA's over there. And you've trained up. You've man trained in a quip. 2000 of these soldiers.

3234
02:34:48.08 --> 02:34:53.52
He's like, yeah. And I was like, holy shit dude, that's a big deal, man. That's like our formation

3235
02:34:53.52 --> 02:34:59.52
in a SW and action over there. You know, yeah. Like by that, you mean all of the West Coast seal

3236
02:34:59.52 --> 02:35:04.16
and all support. Yeah. In action. Yeah. And so these guys were trained up these guys and they're

3237
02:35:04.16 --> 02:35:08.72
going in and they're fighting the Taliban. And he's got his ODA's doing it. I was like, holy shit,

3238
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:14.16
that's pretty badass, man. So it was a good deployment, like not much going on outside the

3239
02:35:14.16 --> 02:35:18.24
wire. The area I was in was actually like, yeah, I was like, cool. I just got out of Nailin. Then I go over

3240
02:35:18.24 --> 02:35:22.96
there. And I'm like, they're going back in Nailin. The terrain is exactly what they say. I would

3241
02:35:22.96 --> 02:35:27.28
know, there was some hub hub about us losing our desert training facility. Someone else was going

3242
02:35:27.28 --> 02:35:33.60
to take it over. Oh, yeah. And I made this this slide show. Did I ever show you that? I made a slide

3243
02:35:33.60 --> 02:35:40.48
show. And it was pictures of Afghanistan and pictures of our desert training facility side by side.

3244
02:35:40.48 --> 02:35:45.20
And you literally couldn't tell the difference. Wow. And I was like, you've got to be kidding me.

3245
02:35:45.20 --> 02:35:52.32
If you think that this isn't the greatest training site for us to have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So

3246
02:35:52.32 --> 02:35:56.64
anyways, that was a short deployment at that point. I'm the ops master chief that I'm deployed.

3247
02:35:57.20 --> 02:36:02.88
Come back six months later. I got home right before July. And then as I'm back at the team,

3248
02:36:02.88 --> 02:36:06.80
the team's going through unit level training. And then we're prepping up for our deployment

3249
02:36:06.80 --> 02:36:12.80
in March timeframe. And that was a weird deployment. Like we wanted up some of us wound up back

3250
02:36:12.80 --> 02:36:19.68
over in Iraq. And so this is 2010, 2011 timeframe now. And we're breaking down Iraq. Yes.

3251
02:36:19.68 --> 02:36:24.80
And we're also yeah, we're waiting for our four battoons. They're still in San Diego to get over to

3252
02:36:24.80 --> 02:36:31.52
Afghanistan. And they're going over to do village stability operations. So get over to Iraq. And

3253
02:36:31.52 --> 02:36:36.24
that, you know, that deployment, it was a long one. It was like eight and a half months long.

3254
02:36:37.36 --> 02:36:41.68
A lot of, you know, the unit we were working with had all the bells and whistles. And it was

3255
02:36:41.68 --> 02:36:46.08
good man. So a lot of good things happened. And our guys wrapped up quite a few bad guys.

3256
02:36:46.64 --> 02:36:50.48
And it was, it was a good learning experience. It was, it was a first time I was in,

3257
02:36:51.28 --> 02:36:57.28
you know, a professional jock setting where you're actually seeing everything unfold in real time.

3258
02:36:57.28 --> 02:37:02.40
All they ask that you can imagine, you know, and our guys did some good targeting. They got a

3259
02:37:02.40 --> 02:37:07.12
couple of bad guys have been after for four or five years. So it was good. Then came back off that

3260
02:37:07.12 --> 02:37:11.44
deployment. Then took over as the team, you know, command master chief. So explain what a team

3261
02:37:11.44 --> 02:37:19.12
command master chief is. Well, our primary job is to initially use the setup the battoons. You're

3262
02:37:19.12 --> 02:37:23.12
working with the, you know, the top five of the team, the commanding officer of the XO,

3263
02:37:23.12 --> 02:37:27.68
your operations department, you know, the senior listed in there and the, and the ops boss.

3264
02:37:30.48 --> 02:37:34.24
In, in your primary functions are manning training and equipping the civil team. And you're the

3265
02:37:34.24 --> 02:37:40.80
senior and listed leader and tactical advisor to the commanding officer. Your primary goal is training

3266
02:37:40.80 --> 02:37:47.04
up all these, you're not training, educating and training, you know, your, your patoon chiefs and

3267
02:37:47.04 --> 02:37:54.80
task unit senior listed advisors. Can't junior officers. And so you take over this position and

3268
02:37:54.80 --> 02:38:02.40
you start building platoons. Yeah. Yeah. And I always used to say about platoons. Let's say there's a

3269
02:38:02.40 --> 02:38:11.04
magic number. Let's say the number number is 20. Yeah. In your top four in a platoon. So your LPO,

3270
02:38:11.04 --> 02:38:15.52
your assistant platoon commander, your platoon commander, your platoon chief. That number's got a equal

3271
02:38:15.52 --> 02:38:23.44
20. When you add them all together. Yeah. So that means if you have a platoon chief, that's like a

3272
02:38:23.44 --> 02:38:29.76
16 because he's just a badass. Cool. You can give them a platoon commander. That's like a two and of LPO

3273
02:38:29.76 --> 02:38:37.60
that's a one. If you have a platoon chief, that's like a, you know, maybe a six, you got to give them a

3274
02:38:37.60 --> 02:38:42.64
platoon commander. That's maybe like a seven and you got to even it out. What you don't want to do

3275
02:38:42.64 --> 02:38:47.04
is make sure first of all, you got to make sure that the number gets to 20. Yeah. Because if it doesn't

3276
02:38:47.04 --> 02:38:51.92
get to 20, you're going to have issues. Then then you got to compliment strengths and weaknesses.

3277
02:38:51.92 --> 02:38:54.96
You know, if you've got a guy that's got a bunch of tactical experience, put his horrible

3278
02:38:54.96 --> 02:39:00.96
paperwork. Well, cool. You know, put him with a person that's good at good at paperwork. So there's

3279
02:39:00.96 --> 02:39:07.92
a lot of balancing in there that you need to do. Absolutely. And I know, uh, our 20, when we formed

3280
02:39:07.92 --> 02:39:12.48
of the team in 2010, we went with some heavy platoon. What the idea we're going to go back and

3281
02:39:12.48 --> 02:39:18.96
have gannistered. And in one of the things with our training and deployment schedules, that there's

3282
02:39:18.96 --> 02:39:24.08
a lot of lag time in there. So things are always changing. And I was like, man, when we get back

3283
02:39:24.08 --> 02:39:28.64
and I'm forming up the team, I want to make sure just to your point, all these platoons are balanced

3284
02:39:28.64 --> 02:39:33.04
out. You know, when you go heavy and some platoons, that means you're going to be light in the others.

3285
02:39:33.04 --> 02:39:39.44
Yeah. And that comes, that comes at a cost. And in the really, what I wanted was you got how many

3286
02:39:39.44 --> 02:39:44.000
platoon do you have a seal team? You should be able to pick up any one of those platoons and snap them in,

3287
02:39:44.56 --> 02:39:49.28
no matter where, you know, where you're going, what the mission is. They should all be

3288
02:39:49.28 --> 02:39:54.48
pretty balanced out equally with experience in the platoon, leadership. Yeah, you're, yeah, check.

3289
02:39:54.48 --> 02:40:00.000
And here's another thing to be careful of. Be to watch out for. You, you're trying to get to 20.

3290
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:10.000
You don't build the platoon with a leadership level 40. Yeah. Because it's probably not going to work

3291
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.08
the way you think it is. What you're going to end up with is a bunch of big personalities. Like,

3292
02:40:14.08 --> 02:40:20.56
you take the strongest possible OIC, the strongest possible chief, the strongest possible LPO,

3293
02:40:20.56 --> 02:40:24.56
and the strongest, what you're going to end up with is people that they all want to freaking

3294
02:40:24.56 --> 02:40:27.04
stab each other in the back. They all want to be the guy. They all want to, they have such

3295
02:40:27.04 --> 02:40:32.32
begos and it just turns into a nightmare. So building the stacked platoon leadership is generally

3296
02:40:32.32 --> 02:40:36.88
not a good call. And you're going to even even if it happened, if you actually had such

3297
02:40:36.88 --> 02:40:44.24
exceptional individuals that they actually did work well together, well, then it's bad that you

3298
02:40:44.24 --> 02:40:47.92
have them all together. Because like you said, you're not balanced now, they'll rush to the teams.

3299
02:40:47.92 --> 02:40:55.52
Because because you should take those exceptionally, because for a, for a level 20 individual leader,

3300
02:40:55.52 --> 02:41:04.40
actually, for, for a level 17 individual leader to work with another high performing leader,

3301
02:41:04.40 --> 02:41:10.48
that other leader needs to be a 20. Yeah. Because that, the person that's a 20 and 20 instead of a

3302
02:41:10.48 --> 02:41:18.64
17, the difference between a 17 and a 20 is that 17 can can subordinate their ego. That's the

3303
02:41:18.64 --> 02:41:23.28
difference. Because when you take two people that are 18s, they're missing quality that they don't have

3304
02:41:23.28 --> 02:41:27.20
is that they don't, they don't know how to work with other people and subordinate their ego.

3305
02:41:27.20 --> 02:41:34.80
That's what gets you to a freaking level 20 yourself. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The balanced out patoons are

3306
02:41:34.80 --> 02:41:40.32
our key for the entire team. It's goodness. And you think about it. So if I'm bringing in a patoon,

3307
02:41:41.12 --> 02:41:45.92
we really spread out our guys with two and three patoons. Because those guys are developing

3308
02:41:45.92 --> 02:41:49.84
the next set of leaders below them. The patoon chief and LPO and everyone's got to develop the

3309
02:41:49.84 --> 02:41:53.60
other guys too. But those guys have the most impact. When the leadership's gone, they're the

3310
02:41:53.60 --> 02:41:59.28
guys that are around and their shown on what right looks like. So we crossed it quite a few guys,

3311
02:41:59.28 --> 02:42:05.84
got everything balanced out good. And overall, our deployment was un-eventful for that one,

3312
02:42:05.84 --> 02:42:13.20
went over to Sincam and we were on standby to standby. That was after Ben Gazi and happy. So the

3313
02:42:13.20 --> 02:42:17.28
new normal was, hey, beyond standby, in case there's a crisis in there. If crisis comes up,

3314
02:42:17.28 --> 02:42:25.44
we want to have special operations posture to go handle an embassy type event. And it was good.

3315
02:42:25.44 --> 02:42:29.60
So for that deployment, we wanted to, you know, in and out of the embassy quite a bit, which was good.

3316
02:42:29.60 --> 02:42:33.60
Because I was like, oh, I've never been in embassy before. So you're talking directly to

3317
02:42:33.60 --> 02:42:38.16
the ambassador and whole new world. Yeah. And you got to be professional. You got to have your suit on.

3318
02:42:38.16 --> 02:42:43.92
And you know, you can't drop any of bombs out there. Yeah. It's a whole new world. Yeah. So it was a

3319
02:42:43.92 --> 02:42:48.80
really good learning experience, although nothing happened. I don't say this. We got poshured.

3320
02:42:49.52 --> 02:42:55.20
You know, we had a unit over into a neighboring country. And that country was, you know,

3321
02:42:55.60 --> 02:43:00.48
they were going through a withdrawal process. And our unit still stayed in position, but we were

3322
02:43:00.48 --> 02:43:05.20
going to reinforce that unit. So we were staged. We had to stage. So we brought in the aircraft,

3323
02:43:05.20 --> 02:43:09.52
which, you know, we're going through a full blown rehearsal. Like we're, we think and we're going to launch

3324
02:43:09.52 --> 02:43:16.08
our guys. And you know, our, my biggest takeaway from that point was like, hey, these relationships,

3325
02:43:16.08 --> 02:43:20.56
we have with the embassy, they matter. Because all we had to do was call up there because we had a

3326
02:43:20.56 --> 02:43:24.56
tight relationship. And they tell us, hey, here's what's going on. The ambassadors working with

3327
02:43:24.56 --> 02:43:27.68
the prints and the prints. And they're going through this whole thing. Do we want to launch out

3328
02:43:27.68 --> 02:43:33.36
here? Do we not want to launch out here? So it was good. You know, it was boring, but it was a good

3329
02:43:33.36 --> 02:43:38.96
learning experience. Yeah. And for for people that don't really know too much about this world,

3330
02:43:38.96 --> 02:43:45.04
there, there can be and usually is a lot of tension between the state department, which is the

3331
02:43:45.04 --> 02:43:52.000
ambassadors and whatnot and the military. Yeah. Because the state department wants to solve things

3332
02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.68
diplomatically. Yeah. That's what their life is, right? And the military, we think we can solve

3333
02:43:57.68 --> 02:44:03.28
things militarily. So there's tension. Yeah. There's often tension between those two sides.

3334
02:44:03.28 --> 02:44:09.20
But if you remember that, hey, we all have the same goal, right? We all have the goal of

3335
02:44:09.20 --> 02:44:14.48
stability and security and overall peace. So if we understand that and we're working towards the same

3336
02:44:14.48 --> 02:44:19.04
goal, let's figure out the best way to go about it. And those tensions look hopefully we can

3337
02:44:19.04 --> 02:44:23.12
overcome. Yeah. Because they can cause to, they can cause some really bad things to happen.

3338
02:44:23.12 --> 02:44:28.96
You know, there can be times where the military should be used. And if the relationship was good,

3339
02:44:28.96 --> 02:44:33.36
the military would be used. Yeah. And there's some times where the military shouldn't be used.

3340
02:44:33.36 --> 02:44:37.12
Yeah. And if the relationship is bad, the military gets used even though it really shouldn't be used.

3341
02:44:37.12 --> 02:44:41.60
Yeah. So once again, forming good relationships is,

3342
02:44:42.80 --> 02:44:47.84
it's just freaking critical. No, absolutely. Especially in that environment, more so than ever.

3343
02:44:47.84 --> 02:44:52.56
You know, hey, going back into when we were forming up, you know, one of the first things we did

3344
02:44:52.56 --> 02:44:59.28
is, you know, what grabbed in our go-lock, you know, our, our enlisted formation, he's 79.

3345
02:44:59.28 --> 02:45:04.88
And we went through roles and responsibilities. And the CMCI had at the time when I was my

3346
02:45:04.88 --> 02:45:09.60
task unit, when I was a task unit, senior, the supervisor. He went through, and I don't know how

3347
02:45:09.60 --> 02:45:14.16
much you played into the roles and responsibilities. He developed or if they crossed actual

3348
02:45:14.16 --> 02:45:18.40
what, but he went through every position. So I'd already had something that I'd kept for

3349
02:45:18.40 --> 02:45:24.96
G's. What is this? Four years now, four or five years later. And I've got it and I go through,

3350
02:45:24.96 --> 02:45:30.000
and I'm, I'm tweaking the verbage in there to fit to, you know, to art to our era or time to our era.

3351
02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:35.36
Yeah. And so go through roles and responsibilities with the go-lock and our tactical level leaders.

3352
02:45:35.36 --> 02:45:40.72
Hey, here's my expectations as a leader. And we had your jockel brief on there. So I had a little

3353
02:45:40.72 --> 02:45:44.80
reading folder on our drive. Here's what's in there. Read this shit. It's going to make you better

3354
02:45:44.80 --> 02:45:50.32
leader. And I think for the most part, our guys did. Like we didn't have too many missteps for that,

3355
02:45:51.44 --> 02:45:57.44
for that workup cycle and deployment. You know, things were relatively contained. You know, like

3356
02:45:57.44 --> 02:46:04.16
no cookie shit. No big event. Yeah, setting expectations is definitely solid. And in the in the

3357
02:46:04.48 --> 02:46:09.84
seal version of the jockel brief, there's a side that was roles and responsibilities. By person. Yep.

3358
02:46:09.84 --> 02:46:15.60
Like task unit commander, here's what you're doing. And I went right on down the line. And I'm sure

3359
02:46:15.60 --> 02:46:20.32
you guys had to adjust it to. But the point is, and the reason I don't give it really in this

3360
02:46:20.32 --> 02:46:23.84
civil, because I don't give it. I don't give roles and responsibilities part of the brief,

3361
02:46:24.56 --> 02:46:28.56
because I don't know what the roles and responsibilities are in this construction company. You

3362
02:46:28.56 --> 02:46:32.80
were in this manufacturing company or in this financial company, right? It changes the shifts.

3363
02:46:32.80 --> 02:46:36.56
But in the seal, but in the seal, but in the seal, in the seal task unit, I knew what the rules

3364
02:46:36.56 --> 02:46:41.28
responsibilities were. And listen, and here's something I used to explain. Like, if you're

3365
02:46:42.40 --> 02:46:49.68
the platoon chief and you're supposed to be the person that's handling the tactical situation.

3366
02:46:50.40 --> 02:46:55.60
Okay. If the officer is supposed to be looking at the next move that we're going to take.

3367
02:46:56.24 --> 02:47:01.76
Hey, listen, chief, if your officer is not capable of doing that, you better get your LPO trained

3368
02:47:01.76 --> 02:47:06.000
up so he can handle the tactical situation. So you can go and and figure out what you're going to

3369
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:12.24
do next. So we have to be able to not just do like our specific job, our role in responsibility,

3370
02:47:12.24 --> 02:47:17.20
but if we have to inside of our platoon, we might have to say, hey, you know what, chief, you handle this

3371
02:47:17.20 --> 02:47:22.48
over here. You know, if I got a chief that's not super dynamic on target, and I got an LPO that's a

3372
02:47:22.48 --> 02:47:28.88
badass. I'll go, hey, hey, LPO, you're going to be responsible for this stuff. You're going to be

3373
02:47:28.88 --> 02:47:34.08
responsible for the assault. Chief, you're going to be responsible for the marshalling. Okay, cool.

3374
02:47:34.08 --> 02:47:38.40
Got it. You're like, that's okay. It doesn't matter. Now, look, don't let your ego get in the way

3375
02:47:38.40 --> 02:47:42.08
because the chief will almost be in charge of your assault. Cool. You're not good at it.

3376
02:47:42.08 --> 02:47:46.64
Yeah. And of course, I'd be much more gentle about it. What I would say is, hey, you know,

3377
02:47:46.64 --> 02:47:50.24
well, the thing is I want the LPO to get some experience. So we're going to let him handle some of

3378
02:47:50.24 --> 02:47:55.20
these right now and see how he does. And in the meantime, you can just kind of handle the marshalling

3379
02:47:55.20 --> 02:48:01.68
over here, you know, with the with the A, O, I see. But yeah, those roles responsibility. So the fact

3380
02:48:01.68 --> 02:48:07.68
that you laid those out early, let's everyone know what the expectation is. Let's everybody know

3381
02:48:07.68 --> 02:48:12.24
where you stand. Right. Let's everybody know like, hey, I don't put up, I'm not going to put up with

3382
02:48:12.24 --> 02:48:16.40
this. I'm not going to put up with that. I'm not going to put up with the other thing. If you're

3383
02:48:16.40 --> 02:48:21.12
out of line, come, you better come and tell me what's going on. If I get blindsided, you're going to be

3384
02:48:21.12 --> 02:48:28.96
problems. So all those, all those things, absolutely. Like, that's a great point. Setting those expectations

3385
02:48:28.96 --> 02:48:36.72
of what you, what you need, what you want, what your standards are. You set those out of the gate.

3386
02:48:36.72 --> 02:48:41.76
It's going to line people real quick. Yeah. And then you model them. You got a model. Yeah, yeah,

3387
02:48:41.76 --> 02:48:45.44
I do what you're saying. Oh, yeah, if you're, if you're not, you might as well just freaking

3388
02:48:46.24 --> 02:48:50.32
just not even put out the word. If you're going to say, hey, everyone be square away. You're going to

3389
02:48:50.32 --> 02:48:55.28
act like a jackass. Just don't even put it out. Yeah, just clean your own videos. This is good.

3390
02:48:55.28 --> 02:49:01.52
Don't move. And then what? And then what? So finish up that deployment. Come back. And then I

3391
02:49:01.52 --> 02:49:06.96
go and work it out. Headquarters for our forest master chief, which was an awesome guy at the

3392
02:49:06.96 --> 02:49:11.92
time, or truckload from him, which I would have tried to be able to use from our next two positions.

3393
02:49:11.92 --> 02:49:17.28
And so at the headquarters element, you know, what I have on here, let me just go back one

3394
02:49:17.28 --> 02:49:21.76
real quick. The headquarters element was good because it was the first time I'm outside of that

3395
02:49:21.76 --> 02:49:28.24
that that sealed team, you know, whether it's training or just seal, you know,

3396
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.44
mission. You're up at the headquarters element. You know, I was in the same

3397
02:49:33.44 --> 02:49:37.28
office here, but I'm working for the forest. You're working for the admiral. So it's

3398
02:49:37.28 --> 02:49:41.92
very similar line. Did you do how long do you work there for? Right around less than a year and a

3399
02:49:41.92 --> 02:49:47.20
half got it. But it was enough. We're ready to get out of there after 12 months. But here's what I would

3400
02:49:47.20 --> 02:49:54.000
say. I wish I would have done that position early or on, probably like as a chief or a senior chief.

3401
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.76
But what is right? Look like where does it fit? The training I think would have priority because

3402
02:49:57.76 --> 02:50:03.12
that's going to set you up tactically. But going up there, you're like holy cow, your aperture

3403
02:50:03.12 --> 02:50:10.72
just opens wide up with actually how things work. You know, with with seal battoons going over

3404
02:50:10.72 --> 02:50:15.52
in two Afghanistan and do I rack? How all that stuff works? You want more gear? Here's the

3405
02:50:15.52 --> 02:50:20.72
process to procure the gear and you're going through all that. One of the things the guy I

3406
02:50:20.72 --> 02:50:26.08
worked for did is he was up there and he like he laid out initiatives. Hey, here's the initiatives.

3407
02:50:26.08 --> 02:50:31.68
I want to get over the line and then I was the guy, you know, when he's on travel back at the

3408
02:50:31.68 --> 02:50:36.72
black palace trying to move these tanks forward as you know, as quickly as possible without

3409
02:50:36.72 --> 02:50:40.80
missing anything. So it was a good experience and the guy I worked for he had over 30 years and

3410
02:50:40.80 --> 02:50:45.36
he bounced around just he was a good dude man. Yeah, learn a lot from him. Yeah, well,

3411
02:50:45.36 --> 02:50:49.84
you're right. I did work it. We worked in the exact same front of the college, the front office.

3412
02:50:49.84 --> 02:50:59.36
Yeah. And for sure, when you start to see, you start to see how small of a roll, right? Like

3413
02:51:00.88 --> 02:51:05.36
you're small. There's like there's like the whole military. That's the first time you get a taste of

3414
02:51:05.92 --> 02:51:10.32
like did you go to the Pentagon? Did you go on travel with your boss? I went back to a

3415
02:51:10.32 --> 02:51:15.68
socom. I didn't travel that much with those guys. Yeah, so I was going to the Pentagon. Yeah.

3416
02:51:15.68 --> 02:51:24.56
I was I was you know sitting in in the back of the meeting with socom, you know, over and over again

3417
02:51:24.56 --> 02:51:31.36
and here in the world being put out and seeing the handwritten notes from the secretary of defense,

3418
02:51:31.36 --> 02:51:36.16
you know what I'm saying? Like all the sudden you realize how big this machine is

3419
02:51:36.16 --> 02:51:43.20
and that puts things in perspective for you. And yes, you learn a lot about you know how to make things

3420
02:51:43.20 --> 02:51:47.36
happen and how well not how to make things happen, but how things happen. And then you can at least

3421
02:51:47.36 --> 02:51:51.04
provide some level of influence on trying to hopefully make things happen yourself. Yeah.

3422
02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:56.08
Because that's a big understanding it makes all the difference in the world. Yeah, because now you know how to

3423
02:51:56.08 --> 02:52:00.48
navigate it. Yeah, and you also know like I'm there's no point getting frustrated about this thing over here.

3424
02:52:00.48 --> 02:52:05.60
Because I can at least explain to the troops. Hey, this is why this is happening. I know it seems

3425
02:52:05.60 --> 02:52:11.36
crazy, but guess what? The money that's getting spent for weapons right now was actually allocated

3426
02:52:11.36 --> 02:52:18.24
five years ago. Yeah. Yeah. And so if you're going to be mad about it, that's fine, but it's not going

3427
02:52:18.24 --> 02:52:24.08
to help. Yeah. Yeah. That and that was the issue. I remember we were getting gear three, four years

3428
02:52:24.08 --> 02:52:29.68
later that was designed for the previous three years. And it was already obsolete. Like I don't

3429
02:52:29.68 --> 02:52:35.12
do, I can't even use this stuff right now. You know, but it was good. And I remember being up there in 2015.

3430
02:52:35.12 --> 02:52:39.92
And I think that was when you and Dave sent your first published copy of extreme ownership

3431
02:52:39.92 --> 02:52:43.68
up there for approval. Oh, yeah. Well, then it wasn't a published copy. It was probably like a

3432
02:52:43.68 --> 02:52:48.32
man you script. That's what it was. So I got me a copy of that. Oh, really got the early one.

3433
02:52:48.32 --> 02:52:51.84
I got the early one. So I read through that in order to expect, you know, in the back then everyone's

3434
02:52:51.84 --> 02:52:55.52
going, hey, man, people are on the net writing books. I'm like, let's see what Jocelyn

3435
02:52:55.52 --> 02:52:59.44
lay for writing about here. A little courtesy copy. And I remember picking up my reading like

3436
02:52:59.44 --> 02:53:03.68
damn, this is really good because the way you guys translated into the business role was just,

3437
02:53:03.68 --> 02:53:10.88
you know, it made sense, you know. So in plus you recognized it all. Yeah. From from the Jockel

3438
02:53:10.88 --> 02:53:16.56
brief, which is, you know, basically where your hall came from. Yeah. And your guys at the way you

3439
02:53:16.56 --> 02:53:21.12
wrote it, the position on it was from a humility standpoint, which people are going to appreciate

3440
02:53:21.12 --> 02:53:28.24
that. So it was good, man. Yeah, I know that was a that was a big obstacle to overcome mentally.

3441
02:53:28.24 --> 02:53:36.24
You know, like, for me it was massive. You know, I can't speak for life, but like for me, I mean,

3442
02:53:36.24 --> 02:53:41.36
we just talked, open this whole thing up about talking about reputation. Yeah. And all of a sudden,

3443
02:53:41.36 --> 02:53:48.32
you know, you can, you can destroy your reputation by becoming that guy. Yeah. We wrote that book

3444
02:53:48.32 --> 02:53:54.80
and, you know, and that's, so that was horrible. That was a horrible experience to go through.

3445
02:53:54.80 --> 02:53:57.92
It was like walking into the unknown and you can't look and you can't,

3446
02:54:00.16 --> 02:54:07.20
there's look when you write a book, it is not a humble act, right? Like there's no,

3447
02:54:07.20 --> 02:54:11.68
there's, it's like saying, hey, I'm going to go freaking, uh, uh, uh, start a podcast.

3448
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:16.16
Get a designer suit. Yeah, we're starting a podcast. Hey, I'm going to go get a designer suit.

3449
02:54:16.16 --> 02:54:21.60
But it's not, it's not for me. Yeah. Like it doesn't work. Or hey, I'm going to start a podcast and talk

3450
02:54:21.60 --> 02:54:26.56
a bunch. Like when you got to talk about you, so to say you're going to write a book, you're going to

3451
02:54:26.56 --> 02:54:30.48
start a podcast or you're going to put a spotlight on yourself. It's basically what you're doing.

3452
02:54:30.48 --> 02:54:35.04
That's, that's the way I'm saying. Right. When you write a book, you're putting a spotlight on yourself,

3453
02:54:35.04 --> 02:54:39.68
look at me. Yeah. And, and there's no, it doesn't matter what that book says,

3454
02:54:39.68 --> 02:54:47.28
yeah. At least at the initial impression. Like you, you, you, you are putting a spotlight on yourself.

3455
02:54:47.28 --> 02:54:52.96
And I hated that and it was really, it was hard to overcome that. Yeah. But then you think,

3456
02:54:52.96 --> 02:54:56.72
here we are working with these civilian companies. Yeah. And they are

3457
02:54:57.84 --> 02:55:04.000
being able to move forward and execute better. And it's like, you know what,

3458
02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:09.92
the stuff that we learned is probably worth teaching. Yeah. Yeah. The stuff that we learned is

3459
02:55:09.92 --> 02:55:18.32
people need to hear it. And then one of the, the, the Admiral, you know, to kind of had that kind

3460
02:55:18.32 --> 02:55:26.000
of conversation with him. And he says, he said, he goes, you know what, Joko, we are quiet professionals.

3461
02:55:26.40 --> 02:55:32.80
We are not silent professionals. And some of the stories need to be told and some of the lessons

3462
02:55:32.80 --> 02:55:38.72
need to be taught. Yeah. And the way you're doing it is the way it should be done. Yeah.

3463
02:55:38.72 --> 02:55:44.08
And, and that was a real, um, you know, obviously that was about as much reassurance as I could get.

3464
02:55:44.08 --> 02:55:48.80
And then, and then you know, just having, uh, having friends that read the book in the, in the,

3465
02:55:48.80 --> 02:55:54.32
in the teams and were like, bro, legit. Good. And then, and then same thing with the podcast. Like,

3466
02:55:54.32 --> 02:55:58.40
when I started, bro, when I started with the podcast, we know what all my friends started like,

3467
02:55:58.40 --> 02:56:04.48
calling me like, dude, that podcast was sick. And everyone, like, that's when I was super stoked, you know,

3468
02:56:04.48 --> 02:56:09.20
because you feel horrible, uh, and you feel like you're shining a spotlight on yourself. Yeah.

3469
02:56:09.20 --> 02:56:15.60
And what I realized was that people saw it. I was actually trying to shine a spotlight, not on me,

3470
02:56:15.60 --> 02:56:22.000
but like, on the community, not even just our community, but the army, the, the Marine Corps,

3471
02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:29.52
to like, every one that is out there working hard is where where the spotlight was trying to be shine.

3472
02:56:29.52 --> 02:56:33.76
It's just that I happened to hold it. Yeah. And it's pretty sketchy to pick that thing up, bro.

3473
02:56:33.76 --> 02:56:39.20
We, I think about this. Think about if there were podcasts going on in the 90s,

3474
02:56:39.20 --> 02:56:43.92
run, we were coming up where we could learn and go and get information on books to read and

3475
02:56:43.92 --> 02:56:48.24
lessons learned from people that were in Vietnam that are talking, hey, here's some things we

3476
02:56:48.24 --> 02:56:51.92
jacked up. We had a blue on blue. I wish I'd have done this. Here's what I did as a leader. There was

3477
02:56:51.92 --> 02:56:55.76
jacked up. I wish I would have, you know, came over and talked to echo on this day. I mean,

3478
02:56:55.76 --> 02:57:02.80
how much better would we? We had, we had nothing. And, and that's, um, believe me, I think about

3479
02:57:02.80 --> 02:57:08.64
that all the time. I mean, even when I, when Mike Thornton came on, yeah, and we did a full debrief.

3480
02:57:09.20 --> 02:57:14.72
I was like, I was in the seal teams for 20 years. Yeah. And I never got that debrief. I never read

3481
02:57:14.72 --> 02:57:20.32
that debrief. Never saw it. No, no, no, no. All those lessons that he learned. Yeah. And it's like,

3482
02:57:20.32 --> 02:57:27.36
wait a second. That's wrong. I felt horrible. Yeah. And so, you know, what now, it's like, oh,

3483
02:57:27.36 --> 02:57:33.84
you can bring on Roger Hayden because Roger Hayden taught me stuff. Yeah. But how is a new guy

3484
02:57:33.84 --> 02:57:39.04
going to learn about Roger Hayden and his lessons? Yeah. Yeah. You know, and it's not even just lessons

3485
02:57:39.04 --> 02:57:45.60
about hey, cover move or hey, keep it simple. It's lessons about hey, when this happens when you

3486
02:57:45.60 --> 02:57:52.000
lose a guy, when you get a guy badly wounded, when you get somebody that's, you know, acting a certain

3487
02:57:52.000 --> 02:58:00.32
way, when someone's losing combat, like all those lessons, being able to learn them is freaking

3488
02:58:00.32 --> 02:58:05.20
so powerful. Yeah. It only helped people out in the future. You know, it's good. I mean, when I had

3489
02:58:05.20 --> 02:58:13.76
James Webb on, who was, you know, Naval Academy Marine Corps Navy Cross, you know, Secretary of

3490
02:58:13.76 --> 02:58:21.44
Navy. But when we got done, and I mean, he, he wrote the book, uh, fields of fire and incredible

3491
02:58:21.44 --> 02:58:28.96
book. And it's sort of the book that all Vietnam movies are based on. Yeah. All, every movie about

3492
02:58:28.96 --> 02:58:34.80
Vietnam is based on that book in one way or another. And it's based, and that book is is a

3493
02:58:34.80 --> 02:58:41.44
thinly disguised autobiography. But when we got done, we walked out and he was like, I

3494
02:58:42.48 --> 02:58:47.68
never got debrief like that. No one ever debriefed anything that I did in Vietnam like that.

3495
02:58:47.68 --> 02:58:53.52
Wow. And he goes, you know, I wrote, there's some stuff written down in some library and the

3496
02:58:53.52 --> 02:59:00.000
12th floor of the Pentagon, you know, row 17, Alpha. He was no one's ever going to read that.

3497
02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:08.16
And to be able to debrief like that, it's, you know, he's like, thank you. And he, and he has

3498
02:59:08.16 --> 02:59:15.52
son was in freaking Ramadi. Wow. Wow. So, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm just, and we'll do believe me. I mean,

3499
02:59:15.52 --> 02:59:20.000
I mean, I meet, I meet Marines and Army guys and team guys all the time. They're like, oh, yeah,

3500
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:25.76
episode this episode is freaking awesome. Because just what you just said, we didn't get that opportunity

3501
02:59:25.76 --> 02:59:34.88
to be able to get the debriefs from people and hear these lessons. Yeah. And it's so, we're so lucky

3502
02:59:34.88 --> 02:59:39.60
to be able to do that. It's a powerful learning tool. You know, a lot of things we do just

3503
02:59:39.60 --> 02:59:43.76
your point, the military translate right over to the business world for everyone to learn.

3504
02:59:43.76 --> 02:59:48.96
You know, so then what you get done, you got done with the work on what happened. So,

3505
02:59:48.96 --> 02:59:56.24
got done with the work on and went over. And at that time, we're doing rotations with combined

3506
02:59:56.24 --> 03:00:01.28
joint special operations task force. Task force it goes into Iraq and then, you know, the deal

3507
03:00:01.28 --> 03:00:05.52
with the siege of sort of, you know, their charge of the maneuver elements. Yeah. So, basically,

3508
03:00:05.52 --> 03:00:11.28
this is a group that's in charge of all the special operations in a area. In this case, Iraq. Yeah.

3509
03:00:11.28 --> 03:00:14.72
Yep. So, one up there and I think we had, you know, you're working with all these other

3510
03:00:14.72 --> 03:00:18.80
countries and they're reporting you. We're working together as one big team, one big unit.

3511
03:00:18.80 --> 03:00:23.28
I think we had in between 800 and 1100 people with the siege of sort of, and guys are dispersed

3512
03:00:23.28 --> 03:00:29.92
everyone. This is a point in Iraq where, you know, ISIS has a foothold up in Mosul. And we've got,

3513
03:00:29.92 --> 03:00:35.28
you know, as a first time I actually worked with the Marsock. We had their insoths and their

3514
03:00:35.28 --> 03:00:40.88
insock out there along with the 05 headquarters, they were up north. And we had our NSW unit.

3515
03:00:40.88 --> 03:00:48.40
And they were co-located with us there in Baghdad. And so it was a good experience. You know,

3516
03:00:48.40 --> 03:00:55.44
and we're figuring out, hey, how are we going to take down Mosul? You know, there's been several

3517
03:00:55.44 --> 03:00:58.64
rotations before us where everyone's just waiting. One of the Iraq is going to want to do it. One of

3518
03:00:58.64 --> 03:01:03.52
the Iraqis is going to want to do it. And that came to a head on our deployment, which was good.

3519
03:01:04.56 --> 03:01:09.84
And so, finally, we get approval. Guys come in there and, as a whole year as this is 2016.

3520
03:01:09.84 --> 03:01:17.60
So, you know, guys going there and start clearing out Mosul, you know, at some point, you know,

3521
03:01:17.60 --> 03:01:23.12
one of our seal units rotated out in J and his formation rotated in which is awesome. J,

3522
03:01:23.12 --> 03:01:28.16
J's team was awesome. Having his commanding officer did a great job building that out.

3523
03:01:28.16 --> 03:01:34.16
You know, it was, you know, one of the best seal teams I'd seen. So it was good.

3524
03:01:34.16 --> 03:01:40.40
Anyways, they come in and start clearing Mosul. Me and my boss, we push up to, or beel, and then

3525
03:01:40.40 --> 03:01:44.80
out of or beel, we were running a small jok out of there. So we were co-located with,

3526
03:01:46.24 --> 03:01:52.08
got to forget the sea jok. And the sea jok was the one who could clear airspace to drop

3527
03:01:52.08 --> 03:01:57.36
ordinance. And we needed to be co-located with him to help de-conflict in case anything got snagged up.

3528
03:01:59.60 --> 03:02:03.20
So anyways, there was a lot of connect fighting in there going on at that point.

3529
03:02:03.20 --> 03:02:07.04
But a good experience, we're working with, I think, seven or eight different countries.

3530
03:02:07.04 --> 03:02:10.96
First time I've been inside a sea jok, just sort of working like that. You're up in the upper

3531
03:02:10.96 --> 03:02:15.44
leadership and management position, you know, taking on everything that's going on. I'm trying

3532
03:02:15.44 --> 03:02:21.92
to provide my, my boss with the best advice I can on, you know, what I recommend, you know,

3533
03:02:21.92 --> 03:02:27.84
in the boss I had back then, he's an admiral now, but he was just scored away just, even tempered

3534
03:02:27.84 --> 03:02:31.84
guy, people loved him. The other countries loved him. Like, I wanted to get this guy. I'm like,

3535
03:02:31.84 --> 03:02:35.04
I got my first time work going, but he's dialed in and he had a great reputation, you know.

3536
03:02:36.56 --> 03:02:40.48
So it was, it was, it was a good deployment, you know, and it probably the things that

3537
03:02:40.48 --> 03:02:47.12
weighed the most on that deployment is I'd never really been a part of a ramp ceremony to where you're

3538
03:02:47.12 --> 03:02:54.56
like, you're leaving this thing. And we had one of our war officers, and this was our first ramp

3539
03:02:54.56 --> 03:03:01.20
ceremony. And so we had a pilot that was shot down. I want to say it was 2006 time period and

3540
03:03:01.20 --> 03:03:07.52
his remains were never recovered. And our war officer went off this and he's working with a shake.

3541
03:03:07.52 --> 03:03:11.84
And the shake's going, hey, we got the remains if you want them. And they start doing negotiations.

3542
03:03:11.84 --> 03:03:15.68
And then the shake's like, hey, we want to dismount a money and our guy's going back and forth.

3543
03:03:16.56 --> 03:03:22.16
And in just a point up front, I want to make is when you assign the right person, you know,

3544
03:03:22.16 --> 03:03:28.24
the right talent to that to what you're trying to accomplish, you can get a lot over the finish line.

3545
03:03:28.24 --> 03:03:33.28
And I'm saying that up front because there was other agencies that had worked with the shake to try

3546
03:03:33.28 --> 03:03:37.44
to get the remains back. They couldn't get it over the finish line. But here was a guy with never

3547
03:03:37.44 --> 03:03:41.68
done this before. The right temperament, the right attitude went in there and was playing a little

3548
03:03:41.68 --> 03:03:46.16
hardball with this guy, played a little softball over here and he got it over the finish line.

3549
03:03:46.16 --> 03:03:51.76
You know, we wanted to, you know, negotiate with the shake. We got the remains back.

3550
03:03:51.76 --> 03:03:56.16
We went through our ramp ceremony back here and then we got the, you know, the remains back to the

3551
03:03:56.16 --> 03:04:01.44
US who, you know, that officer could be properly buried. And he was, he was a pilot that had been

3552
03:04:01.44 --> 03:04:09.20
shot down. So it was powerful, felt good, you know, felt good. And then we had a few other

3553
03:04:09.20 --> 03:04:15.04
ramp ceremonies. You know, we lost this was one of Jayceo's, these buffers. But he was hit,

3554
03:04:15.04 --> 03:04:20.64
you know, up there in Mosul with an ID and he was killed. And so we did a ramp ceremony

3555
03:04:20.64 --> 03:04:25.92
for him, brought him back. And we had one other guy and I want to tie this back in a

3556
03:04:25.92 --> 03:04:30.96
Romadi, but the third guy we had, he was, you know, he's doing some stuff in another country.

3557
03:04:30.96 --> 03:04:38.40
He was hit hard, he was killed. And we brought him back to us. And it was like the night before

3558
03:04:38.40 --> 03:04:45.68
Thanksgiving back in the US. And in Romadi, we were operating right before Christmas. And, you know,

3559
03:04:45.68 --> 03:04:49.36
the C.J. Soda Commander pulled us out and we were pissed off. We were like, what the hell, man?

3560
03:04:49.36 --> 03:04:53.68
We were planning on being here and through Christmas Eve and through Christmas. And the C.J. Soda

3561
03:04:53.68 --> 03:04:58.48
Commander back in 2006 said, hey, man, I don't want to report back to anyone's family that

3562
03:04:58.48 --> 03:05:03.52
their son was wounded or killed, you know, before Christmas. And then here we are, you know,

3563
03:05:03.52 --> 03:05:09.76
damn near 10 years later. And in Iraq, in this guy gets killed right before Thanksgiving. And his

3564
03:05:09.76 --> 03:05:14.32
family's over with the other family, your wife and kids are over with their family. And they got

3565
03:05:14.32 --> 03:05:18.56
to get notified. We're coming back here, going through all our procedures to make sure everything's

3566
03:05:18.56 --> 03:05:23.60
tightening. He's getting his proper respect before we sent him out. But those things like,

3567
03:05:24.48 --> 03:05:30.24
when you're putting an American on an aircraft in a casket with the flag draped over, man,

3568
03:05:30.24 --> 03:05:36.32
it's just, it's a gut punch, man. It sucks. It sucks, man. It's something I never, you know,

3569
03:05:36.32 --> 03:05:49.60
wish upon anyone. And it really gets home to you, you know, not good.

3570
03:05:51.92 --> 03:05:59.60
How long was that deployment? That was a six-month-tor. And the Iraqis took massive casualties on

3571
03:05:59.60 --> 03:06:04.72
the planet. Before we left, they were like the special, you know, we were working with and it

3572
03:06:04.72 --> 03:06:09.44
trained up over the years. The SF actually trained in well, but they could be at a hand of the

3573
03:06:09.44 --> 03:06:14.72
pie somewhere in there. But they were dialed in. They were the best unit that the Iraqis had. And these

3574
03:06:14.72 --> 03:06:20.64
guys had a lot of pride, but they were like over 800 casualties when we left. And the aides,

3575
03:06:20.64 --> 03:06:28.000
this deal was, I mean, ISIS was no joke over there, man. They were barbaric, brutal. And, you know,

3576
03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:33.12
there's a, there's a fraction of people where you think you're going to come in. You're going to

3577
03:06:33.12 --> 03:06:38.88
talk some sense into some people like that. You're not, you're not talking to them. And if they

3578
03:06:38.88 --> 03:06:42.64
get a hold of you, it's not going to be good for you. You're going to get your head chopped off.

3579
03:06:43.44 --> 03:06:48.08
And that's the type of, that's what you're dealing with over there. And those, you know,

3580
03:06:48.08 --> 03:06:53.20
that unit that our guys were working with, they later it all out there. They're going in there

3581
03:06:53.20 --> 03:06:58.88
for their country for Iraq to secure that city, to make it a better place. And man, they took heavy

3582
03:06:58.88 --> 03:07:09.60
casualties. I mean, heavy casualties. You know, the, the truck bombs, they built from 2004 to 2016,

3583
03:07:09.60 --> 03:07:14.16
they up armored them in 2016. So when they're coming at you, there's no way, there's not a good

3584
03:07:14.16 --> 03:07:18.80
way to defeat them. You need some type of missile system or rocket system coming in on top.

3585
03:07:19.52 --> 03:07:23.28
Or you need some type of arresting device to where you can stop the vehicle from coming at you.

3586
03:07:23.28 --> 03:07:29.04
You know, we had some good penetration with some of our heavy caliber weapons. We'll stop

3587
03:07:29.04 --> 03:07:36.64
them, but it was hard. It was not easy. And in date, hide them underneath, vehicle or carport

3588
03:07:38.32 --> 03:07:41.92
entry points. And you wouldn't be able to tell what it is. And next thing you know, that big

3589
03:07:41.92 --> 03:07:46.72
huge truck bomb is on the move. And there's a farmer at all over the place. And there's just a small

3590
03:07:46.72 --> 03:07:52.24
window that they can look out. And guess what, if they come off the seat or anything happens with the

3591
03:07:52.24 --> 03:07:56.32
seat and their adjustment, the things rigged to just blow. So as soon as it hits something,

3592
03:07:56.32 --> 03:08:01.04
the whole thing is going up. And man, we just remember watching CTSU and it's a damn thing

3593
03:08:01.04 --> 03:08:05.60
it'd become. You'd be trying to call in an air strike. But you got like a minute and 30 seconds

3594
03:08:05.60 --> 03:08:10.80
to clear airspace overhead to get bombs down on targets. So you'd just like, it wasn't going to happen.

3595
03:08:10.80 --> 03:08:16.24
So you had to be able to handle business as a tactical unit on the ground to take this thing out.

3596
03:08:16.24 --> 03:08:21.52
You know, we give these guys rockets and ship, but they weren't effective. So it was a super

3597
03:08:21.52 --> 03:08:27.44
complex and frustrating environment, you know, took a lot of casualties.

3598
03:08:28.16 --> 03:08:34.88
Yeah, no Jason was saying that, you know, at a certain point they were thinking that the Iraqi

3599
03:08:34.88 --> 03:08:39.36
unit that was doing the majority of the fighting was just going to run out of guys. Like they just

3600
03:08:39.36 --> 03:08:45.04
were going to, they were just going to all be dead or all be casualties, which was freaking scary.

3601
03:08:45.04 --> 03:08:49.76
And I was horrified when he was telling me that. And I was hearing some of that while,

3602
03:08:49.76 --> 03:08:54.40
you guys were actually over there. But at the same time, even though it kind of horrified me,

3603
03:08:54.40 --> 03:09:00.88
at the same time, I also was this going to sound wrong, but I was happy to hear it

3604
03:09:01.76 --> 03:09:08.48
because what it told me was that the Iraqis were fighting. Yeah. And when we were in

3605
03:09:08.48 --> 03:09:14.64
Ramadi, the Iraqis, they, they, some of them would fight, but it definitely wasn't. They weren't

3606
03:09:14.64 --> 03:09:20.24
looking to take massive casualties to try and take a city back. Like they didn't care that much. And

3607
03:09:20.24 --> 03:09:25.84
they would run away. We had a whole battalion, a whole battalion to Iraqis soldiers said, yeah,

3608
03:09:25.84 --> 03:09:32.000
we're out. Well, we had one entire company disappear. Like there was a strike on their on one of

3609
03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:37.68
their checkpoints. And they all just bailed. That was that. So to hear how hard the Iraqis were fighting.

3610
03:09:37.68 --> 03:09:41.76
And they were taking it to ISIS and that they were staying in the fight. That was just freaking

3611
03:09:41.76 --> 03:09:45.84
um, that was just, it was awesome to hear that. It was so horrible to hear that they were taking

3612
03:09:45.84 --> 03:09:51.04
casualties, but it was great to hear that they had found the will to fight and that they were

3613
03:09:51.04 --> 03:10:00.80
unified and, and fighting courageously to to liberate other Iraqis inside their country from

3614
03:10:01.20 --> 03:10:08.56
these actual savages that are doing the most hate committing the most heinous atrocities

3615
03:10:08.56 --> 03:10:15.28
imaginable. And it was all it was awesome to hear that they were fighting like that. And it was also,

3616
03:10:15.28 --> 03:10:22.56
you know, when ISIS decided to, you know, wear a uniform and put up flags. It was like right on.

3617
03:10:23.20 --> 03:10:30.48
Let's see how this works out for you. Yeah. Fried them legit. And then what?

3618
03:10:31.20 --> 03:10:36.08
Then what? So finish up with that deployment, get back off of that. And then that's when I rolled

3619
03:10:36.08 --> 03:10:42.96
over to group one. And so, you know, started, you know, I got a good six, six month of getting

3620
03:10:42.96 --> 03:10:48.000
saturated with group level stuff. And, you know, at the group, you're responsible for all, you know,

3621
03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:52.80
four West Coast seal teams and three other commands. So you got roughly right around 1,800 people

3622
03:10:52.80 --> 03:10:57.76
or so. And your primary function there is manning training in equipment. So I'm working directly

3623
03:10:57.76 --> 03:11:03.36
with the team command master chiefs on some occasions there are commanding officers. And so

3624
03:11:03.36 --> 03:11:07.76
you're in a position of a lot of influence at that point. You know, and I'm directly working with

3625
03:11:07.76 --> 03:11:14.40
our Commodore on on our initiatives and moving the mission forward. And you're also dealing with

3626
03:11:14.96 --> 03:11:20.40
whatever sort of, you know, equipment, like trying to get equipment for the guys, trying to just

3627
03:11:20.40 --> 03:11:27.44
the whole nine yards. And overall responsible for their training. Did you go out to the desert during

3628
03:11:27.44 --> 03:11:31.52
that time? We're not there a couple times. Damn bro. And it's just so it's weird. It's different.

3629
03:11:31.52 --> 03:11:37.36
When you're up at that level, when you come down in, it's never the same. It's never, you know,

3630
03:11:37.36 --> 03:11:41.12
you're the guy show for you. Yeah, you're the guy. Then it's like, hey, I'm coming in there to

3631
03:11:41.12 --> 03:11:45.20
see this. And you're like, and man, you guys might want to tighten this shit up over here, you know,

3632
03:11:45.20 --> 03:11:52.48
but it was good, you know, damn who's there? I think Jay, yeah, Jay was it traded at the time.

3633
03:11:52.48 --> 03:11:56.64
So it was good. So Jay was always there right hand man, I had out there and we had a good

3634
03:11:56.64 --> 03:12:01.52
crew of a team committed master chiefs. And one of the things we started doing back in

3635
03:12:02.24 --> 03:12:07.52
2015 with the force I was working with, the force command master chief, as you started implementing

3636
03:12:07.52 --> 03:12:12.48
a screening process. So we were basically going through a hiring to make sure that we were

3637
03:12:12.48 --> 03:12:17.84
getting the right leaders in at the master chief level to take over some of these command positions.

3638
03:12:18.40 --> 03:12:21.44
And it's not perfect, but it was a hell of a lot better than where we were.

3639
03:12:21.44 --> 03:12:26.72
And they also, we also started implementing then, you know, Patoon Chief and TASC unit

3640
03:12:26.72 --> 03:12:31.76
seniorless advisor screening. And that was developing. So it's, it's getting better as a move

3641
03:12:31.76 --> 03:12:35.28
forward. Bottom line is, you know, things are getting better. Your movement thanks forward.

3642
03:12:35.28 --> 03:12:40.96
That's what you want for a better formation. You know, and just going back to work on real quick,

3643
03:12:41.76 --> 03:12:45.20
one of the things I realized when you're up there, you know, when you're down in the troops,

3644
03:12:45.20 --> 03:12:49.20
you're just like, give me my gear. I want to get go to war and do all these things. And

3645
03:12:49.20 --> 03:12:53.52
people talk a lot of shit about everyone above them. And here's the deal with the people that are

3646
03:12:53.52 --> 03:13:00.16
above you. I'm you. I was the E5 talking that shit saying all those things. And guess what? I moved

3647
03:13:00.16 --> 03:13:05.36
up positions, but I moved up in positions to take care of people. Right? And so there's a lot of

3648
03:13:05.36 --> 03:13:09.68
cookie things that come out. You're the guy behind the scenes, squashing these things, you know,

3649
03:13:09.68 --> 03:13:14.64
to make sure that there are people that are taking care of. And I always had, I had a buddy that was,

3650
03:13:14.64 --> 03:13:18.40
you know, he was a hard case. And he's like, hey, man, won't you ever see this?

3651
03:13:18.40 --> 03:13:21.68
Won't you, you need to stand up and say something about that? I'm like, hey, man, I'm handling

3652
03:13:21.68 --> 03:13:26.80
that shit behind closed doors. I'm not going to come here and open form with the commander and disagree

3653
03:13:26.80 --> 03:13:32.000
with them and front of all these people. And that's not smart. I'm getting nowhere. Yeah. But if I come

3654
03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:36.88
around the backside, you're doing a little flank, plant some seeds. You can have a lot more influence

3655
03:13:36.88 --> 03:13:41.92
that way. So anyways, you're always going to get that shit with the hard cases. You know what I'm talking about?

3656
03:13:41.92 --> 03:13:47.20
Yeah. And then how long was that tour? So that was a two-year tour. Yeah. I wanted to finish up my career

3657
03:13:47.20 --> 03:13:53.52
there and towards the end, you're like, I mean, what were you thinking? What was on the horizon

3658
03:13:53.52 --> 03:13:58.40
and what was your decision making process to decide to punch? Punch. Yes. So I punched

3659
03:13:58.40 --> 03:14:02.24
right at like the 28 and a half year mark. So I could have gone another year and a half, but

3660
03:14:02.24 --> 03:14:06.40
man, I was out of juice. And one of the things people talk about is, hey, you know, when it's time

3661
03:14:06.40 --> 03:14:11.84
to go and man, I was in that position and we had some high profile cases out there and they just

3662
03:14:11.84 --> 03:14:17.36
wear on your man, you know, they just wear on you. And even before that happened, I knew it was time

3663
03:14:17.36 --> 03:14:21.28
for me to go, oh my god, I don't want to do this position. It's time for me to move out of here.

3664
03:14:21.28 --> 03:14:26.56
I don't think I had anything left to add value to the mission and the organization. I was

3665
03:14:26.56 --> 03:14:31.68
topped out with my leadership capacity. And we have plenty guys that go out there and do the T-Sawks,

3666
03:14:31.68 --> 03:14:35.60
you know, the theater special operations command and that's a high level of influence. Those

3667
03:14:35.60 --> 03:14:41.68
are action arms in the operational areas. And I was like, man, I just don't see myself going and

3668
03:14:41.68 --> 03:14:45.44
working at that level. You're working with general officers with admiral's and I was like, man,

3669
03:14:45.44 --> 03:14:50.24
I just, I was up at Warcom, kind of got a little bit of a taste of that. And I was like,

3670
03:14:50.24 --> 03:14:55.12
that's just not me. And we need people to do those positions. So we had quite a few East Coast

3671
03:14:55.12 --> 03:15:01.28
guys going into those T-Sawks positions and you need them because that's a huge high level of

3672
03:15:01.28 --> 03:15:07.04
influence that we have in NSW. If you have your guy in there, he can help influence some outcomes,

3673
03:15:07.04 --> 03:15:14.56
which is super important. But I was definitely matched out out of gas time for me to pack up and go home.

3674
03:15:15.36 --> 03:15:23.20
And one of the things that always comes to mind with me is in 2003, you know, we had Posi out there

3675
03:15:23.20 --> 03:15:27.84
or Vietnam guy, good dude, man, just good family guy, Vietnam had more stores and you can imagine.

3676
03:15:27.84 --> 03:15:35.68
But he was like, man, Steve, you guys are stronger, faster, smarter than we ever were.

3677
03:15:35.68 --> 03:15:40.96
I was like, dang what's he talking about? And then I looked back, you know, 28, you know, 15 years

3678
03:15:40.96 --> 03:15:45.52
later, whatever it was. And I'm like these young guys that are coming in, they're hungry,

3679
03:15:45.52 --> 03:15:50.48
they're smarter, they're stronger than I was. They're faster than I was, meaning they

3680
03:15:50.48 --> 03:15:54.48
the communities in a good spot. We got our next generation coming up and through our ranks,

3681
03:15:54.48 --> 03:16:00.96
doing good things. You know, one of the things, one of our head leaders for the Navy put out

3682
03:16:01.60 --> 03:16:06.88
Macpond Stevens, he said, hey, work hard, stay out of trouble and be a good person. That's all I'm

3683
03:16:06.88 --> 03:16:11.20
asking the formation to do. The entire Navy, that was his mantra. Work hard, stay out of trouble,

3684
03:16:11.20 --> 03:16:17.60
be a good and be a good and decent human being, be a good person. And I never knew what the

3685
03:16:17.60 --> 03:16:23.12
healthy meant by stay out of trouble. And then, you know, as you start moving up in these positions

3686
03:16:23.12 --> 03:16:28.64
and you have high profile cases and things going on, they can bring your entire community down to

3687
03:16:28.64 --> 03:16:34.48
its knees, meaning it's hard to move initiatives forward. It's hard to focus on what your actual

3688
03:16:34.48 --> 03:16:39.76
job is because you're dealing with, you know, in JP you're dealing with court marshals, all those

3689
03:16:39.76 --> 03:16:47.76
things weigh on you and it's never good. In my boss in 2015, our four C, he hammered it home to me

3690
03:16:47.76 --> 03:16:52.40
and it made sense. He said, hey Steve, we've got a protect emission, we've got to protect our

3691
03:16:52.40 --> 03:16:57.28
credibility, credibility, it's built, know the people's blood, it was built, know the people's blood,

3692
03:16:57.28 --> 03:17:01.60
we've got to protect that at all cost. And he's like it's hard for us to protect the homeland

3693
03:17:01.60 --> 03:17:07.20
if we've got, if our credibility's damaged and we can't get employed overseas to wrap up bad guys.

3694
03:17:07.20 --> 03:17:14.48
And I was like, yeah, check, that ship makes sense. So, yeah, well, that's the same thing as a

3695
03:17:14.48 --> 03:17:18.24
reputation, right? Yeah. The community has a reputation and you've got to do everything you can to

3696
03:17:18.24 --> 03:17:25.84
protect that reputation because if you're, yeah, just, just what you have to do and you do your best.

3697
03:17:26.48 --> 03:17:30.40
You do everything you can to protect the reputation. I mean, that's what you got to do, you know.

3698
03:17:32.08 --> 03:17:35.92
Man, any other echo, you got anything?

3699
03:17:38.96 --> 03:17:43.92
Said something about a firecracker earlier, like firecracker scenario or whatever and you were like,

3700
03:17:43.92 --> 03:17:48.72
oh, you got the firecracker right off the bat or something like that, like that was the nickname. It was the

3701
03:17:48.72 --> 03:17:57.44
nickname for an area in Ramadi that was north of Route Michigan and it was this little road that

3702
03:17:57.44 --> 03:18:01.76
wrapped up in the round. It was called firecracker and the reason it was called firecracker was because

3703
03:18:01.76 --> 03:18:06.72
there was a lot of bad shit going on here. There was a lot of fire like a lot of firecracking off

3704
03:18:06.72 --> 03:18:12.32
and as you said. Interesting. Okay. And that was like your first, that was our first

3705
03:18:12.32 --> 03:18:17.52
operation and Ramadi. Dude, that's a welcome to Ramadi situation right there. Damn.

3706
03:18:18.72 --> 03:18:25.12
It was good. That was good. That's a lot. Freaking crazy. Anything else Steve? Any closing thoughts?

3707
03:18:28.24 --> 03:18:34.08
No, that's it. Right all man. Well, thanks for coming on, man. Yeah.

3708
03:18:35.68 --> 03:18:40.16
Oh, you know what I'll say one more thing at one point, probably you were like six months out from

3709
03:18:40.16 --> 03:18:44.88
retiring and you said I have three courses of action for what I'm going to do and I get out

3710
03:18:46.48 --> 03:18:51.12
echelon front echelon front echelon front. I was like right all man. Pretty good. Awesome.

3711
03:18:51.84 --> 03:18:58.72
Which is a rip off from the marine that I covered the book on the podcast where when he was

3712
03:18:58.72 --> 03:19:06.64
getting ready to graduate from the basics school and they had to fill out what they wanted to do

3713
03:19:06.64 --> 03:19:12.000
and this was the 1967 that it fell out what they wanted to do in the Marine Corps and he put one,

3714
03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:16.40
two, three infantry, two commander infantry, two commander infantry, two commander. It's like that's

3715
03:19:16.40 --> 03:19:20.80
what I'm going to do. I was like, Roger that. All right. Yes, we're going to execute on this thing.

3716
03:19:20.80 --> 03:19:27.28
So it's freaking awesome. Thanks for what you did to the teams for the teams. Obviously for America,

3717
03:19:27.28 --> 03:19:33.28
obviously and and and for freedom and I know we had an awesome time working together in the past. I

3718
03:19:33.28 --> 03:19:39.28
still I just when I drive at night whenever I drive at night, especially out here in California,

3719
03:19:39.28 --> 03:19:44.88
the desert, I'm always thinking I'm driving back from from the desert from our desert training facility

3720
03:19:44.88 --> 03:19:51.12
and just with just totally amped because I wouldn't be able to sleep because I'd be so fired up

3721
03:19:51.12 --> 03:19:58.000
from the teams and for the boys and I'd be like just amped driving back, knowing that we made some

3722
03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:04.16
freaking guys ready for war. So it was awesome working with you then and awesome working with you again

3723
03:20:04.16 --> 03:20:10.000
right now, man. Yeah, I really appreciate it. I'm glad to be on with with Eshelon front. It's awesome.

3724
03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:14.000
Can I say one thing real quick? Yeah. Yeah, I like to thank my wife, Allison. She's put up with me

3725
03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:20.80
for all these years. She's prior military. Good southern girl from Arkansas and she runs a tight

3726
03:20:20.80 --> 03:20:26.32
game. She keeps me and she keeps me in line. So I love with all my heart. She's an awesome person.

3727
03:20:26.32 --> 03:20:34.80
And my kids, I love you guys. Right, oh, man. Awesome. Well, echo. Yes, sir. Speaking of

3728
03:20:37.20 --> 03:20:42.48
getting after it. Speaking or speaking of being awesome. What do you think we can do to

3729
03:20:43.76 --> 03:20:49.12
become more awesome to strive? Strived. Strived for awesomeness at the very least. How about that?

3730
03:20:49.12 --> 03:20:55.28
Strived. There's some podcast we did from some ancient warrior. Shaking the world with your

3731
03:20:55.28 --> 03:21:02.64
awesomeness. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, that's a big step. Good striving to shaking the world.

3732
03:21:02.64 --> 03:21:07.36
Hmm. Same thing. Like that's kind of a big step for sure. So let's start with striving. Cool.

3733
03:21:07.36 --> 03:21:14.64
Good. All right. Well, hey, in your path to strive for awesomeness more and the event that you're

3734
03:21:14.64 --> 03:21:20.32
just straight up trying to shake the world with awesomeness. Hey, look, you might need some supplementation.

3735
03:21:20.32 --> 03:21:28.000
Okay, let me let me start this by Steve, you know, you listen to the podcast. Yes. How often do you

3736
03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:36.96
listen to this part of the podcast? What percentage of time? I'm probably 50%. 50% you'll let you hang on.

3737
03:21:36.96 --> 03:21:43.60
I'm hang on. Or is it just you can't hit stop on your freaking iPhone? So you just have to go with it. It's like stuff.

3738
03:21:43.60 --> 03:21:47.52
There's so many new products coming out. You've got to listen to it. To kind of go, all right.

3739
03:21:47.52 --> 03:21:54.24
Is there some new line coming out here on my track? Oh, yeah. Let's do it. He makes it good. So so he's saying 50% my guess.

3740
03:21:54.24 --> 03:21:58.24
He's kind of rounding up to be nice because you know, he doesn't want to be like harsh to act.

3741
03:21:58.24 --> 03:22:03.20
That's cool. All of a sudden he is 1%. That's right. He's a little bit at 50. She does 49.

3742
03:22:03.20 --> 03:22:08.000
Here's what I know. I just got a text from JP and and Dave Burke. They want to know if you're going to talk about

3743
03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:15.04
their discipline. Go some sour apple snipals. You mean good deal. Dave. Good deal. Dave. Okay. JP just just tracking on it.

3744
03:22:15.04 --> 03:22:20.56
Yeah. By tracking that Steve's here and then sending taking the time to send a text to say,

3745
03:22:20.56 --> 03:22:25.60
hey, make sure you talk about sour apple sniper. Okay. Dave wants to make JP jealousy.

3746
03:22:25.60 --> 03:22:30.40
You got to mention Dave's afterburner. Okay. No problem. We're on it fully.

3747
03:22:31.04 --> 03:22:36.16
These two guys are just breaking in the game. That's all man. That's all.

3748
03:22:36.16 --> 03:22:40.96
And I dig it. Either way, before we get to the discipline or discipline, go, which are, you know,

3749
03:22:40.96 --> 03:22:44.40
they're kind of different but kind of the same. We're talking about joint supplements.

3750
03:22:45.20 --> 03:22:48.32
It's important because you don't want to think about this kind of stuff while we're trying to

3751
03:22:48.32 --> 03:22:53.36
watch shake the world with, you know, weapons or striver, whatever. You don't want to think about your

3752
03:22:53.36 --> 03:22:56.96
joints. You don't want to think about your immunity getting sick all this kind of stuff. So you take

3753
03:22:56.96 --> 03:23:04.08
these supplements. Join warfare. Join super cruel oil. Joins. Vitamin D3 immunity and general health

3754
03:23:04.08 --> 03:23:10.64
by the way. Vitamin D3 is good for a lot of stuff. All kinds, especially at this moment in time in

3755
03:23:10.64 --> 03:23:18.56
particular, we're talking about factual information about the glory of the vitamin D. It's true.

3756
03:23:18.56 --> 03:23:24.96
Absolutely true. Also cold war immunity supplement. Keep those in mind. So you don't have to

3757
03:23:24.96 --> 03:23:29.68
keep the other stuff in mind. Well, yeah, that's when you've, you've finally gotten through to me.

3758
03:23:29.68 --> 03:23:38.80
It's only taken 260 episodes of a beat. Now I understand that you're like, oh, it's good to not have

3759
03:23:38.80 --> 03:23:44.48
to think about your joint spottering you. Yes. That's a good thing. That is a good thing. So now I understand

3760
03:23:45.36 --> 03:23:51.60
we don't want to wake up and be like, I hope my joints hold up today and work out or whatever.

3761
03:23:51.60 --> 03:23:55.52
It seems to be. Yes. You just want to go into the workout or my people. We want to get it done. Let's

3762
03:23:55.52 --> 03:24:03.20
say exactly right. Also, we have something I may call discipline to supplement for your brain,

3763
03:24:03.20 --> 03:24:08.24
for your body, for your whole thing, really life, your life, man, your life, powder,

3764
03:24:10.32 --> 03:24:14.80
take discipline powder instead of coffee. Try that. Good call. It could be something.

3765
03:24:14.80 --> 03:24:19.20
This is what I'm saying as far as the routine. Also, discipline go, which are and or should I say

3766
03:24:19.20 --> 03:24:26.16
where capsules to begin when they are capsules. This is your on the go. Yes. Did that. They're

3767
03:24:26.16 --> 03:24:32.56
very popular at echelom front. Can I see something on the discipline go capsules? Hey, so I've been

3768
03:24:32.56 --> 03:24:36.40
using that stuff. And so when I'm going in and I'm doing a speaking engagement, that's why they're

3769
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:42.64
so popular. I take two. And here's the deal. When I'm communicating, when I'm not taking that

3770
03:24:42.64 --> 03:24:47.36
stuff, it's like I'm going down the highway and I really have to think hard about the words I'm

3771
03:24:47.36 --> 03:24:53.28
going to communicate. It's like the words are in off the shoot off a street. When I'm on the discipline

3772
03:24:53.28 --> 03:24:57.68
go, the words are right there. On the road, I'm going 60 miles an hour. You're like boom,

3773
03:24:57.68 --> 03:25:02.40
boom, clearic and size communications. And I don't know what's in it, but it definitely clears up

3774
03:25:02.40 --> 03:25:08.32
your mind. It clears up your mind. It works. You got to get, I'm telling you, if you're a boss,

3775
03:25:08.32 --> 03:25:13.28
you got some things going on, a meeting, a high speed meeting, you're talking to people. It helps.

3776
03:25:13.28 --> 03:25:18.32
I promise you it helps. I wouldn't say if it did. Yeah, no, that's why that's why at Eshelon

3777
03:25:18.32 --> 03:25:22.64
front where we get up and we have to not only we have to speak, but we got to take questions and

3778
03:25:22.64 --> 03:25:27.04
trip questions. We got to come up with answers and solutions. And so the team is always like,

3779
03:25:27.04 --> 03:25:33.92
yeah, yeah, I'm going to, I want to bring the A game. Right? How do you ensure you bring the A game?

3780
03:25:33.92 --> 03:25:40.16
Take a little discipline go. And then if you have like a little more time or maybe you want to

3781
03:25:40.16 --> 03:25:47.76
enjoy that a little bit more. You can get a can of discipline go. Yes, which is what you mentioned.

3782
03:25:47.76 --> 03:25:54.24
Right? Many flavors now. It's true. The flavor roster getting big over here. So most recently,

3783
03:25:54.24 --> 03:26:02.72
afterburner orange, good deal. Dave Burke, boom, before that sour apple sniper. JP didn't know

3784
03:26:02.72 --> 03:26:07.68
what are they competing with each other? Oh, good. There's some competition before that.

3785
03:26:07.68 --> 03:26:15.68
Jocco Palmer, which by the way, which by the way, Jocco Palmer, Jocco Palmer is not. Jocco Palmer,

3786
03:26:15.68 --> 03:26:22.08
what it is is it's 50 50, iced tea lemonade. That's what it is. Yeah. Some people were thinking

3787
03:26:22.08 --> 03:26:27.76
it was pomegranate because we also have Jocco, pomegranate, white tea. Yeah, which which you probably

3788
03:26:27.76 --> 03:26:33.68
remember Steve. Yeah. Tell us about that's the origin story right there. At Nyland,

3789
03:26:33.68 --> 03:26:41.84
me rolling into those briefs with that big old plastic protein shaker with freaking with pomegranate

3790
03:26:41.84 --> 03:26:45.44
tea, which I would get from wherever and then I'd just sit there in the front row and they'd give

3791
03:26:45.44 --> 03:26:54.40
their brief and check to just take it notes. You give your points or actually like you know

3792
03:26:54.40 --> 03:26:58.80
whatever. The front line instructors would give their points and then you'd give your points and then

3793
03:26:58.80 --> 03:27:08.24
be like, be like, got anything bossed by back. Oh, there's just a little bit. Yeah,

3794
03:27:08.24 --> 03:27:13.84
this little thing. Yeah, so speaking to caffeine and just a little bit, yes, Jocco Palmer,

3795
03:27:13.84 --> 03:27:19.68
that was the one before that and then before that was what, who's the first signature, oh,

3796
03:27:19.68 --> 03:27:24.96
DAX have it just the first signature was DAX average. Dakota, tasty. Is that your go-to? What's your

3797
03:27:24.96 --> 03:27:31.04
go-to? I like the DAX average. I like the story behind DAX average. Yeah, dude, he's a monster. If you

3798
03:27:31.04 --> 03:27:38.32
can just get a little bit of mentality of Dakota, then your whole, your whole being is better.

3799
03:27:39.20 --> 03:27:45.92
Not enough, no offense to J.P. and Dave. I don't know how to have bad mentalities too. But let's face it.

3800
03:27:45.92 --> 03:27:51.28
DAX average. It's freaking Dakota. What kind of end the game? Dakota's kind of take, do you,

3801
03:27:51.28 --> 03:27:56.32
did you drink Dr. Pepper when you were a kid? I did not. Because that's kind of the, yeah,

3802
03:27:56.32 --> 03:28:02.88
it's kind of the flavor apparently. It's tasting. Yeah, that's my, that's my wife's favorite. Yeah.

3803
03:28:02.88 --> 03:28:08.08
Which, what do you think of that Dakota? I see you tracking on my life. You tracking,

3804
03:28:08.08 --> 03:28:13.44
tracking on my life Dakota. Yeah, so that one's kind of a sour apple sniper is,

3805
03:28:14.88 --> 03:28:19.12
I'm going to say if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth, probably sour apple sniper's your go-to.

3806
03:28:19.12 --> 03:28:26.16
It's true. Dr. Pepper is, if you like, ice tea and lemonade. Yeah, that was my favorite before

3807
03:28:26.16 --> 03:28:32.72
the orange. The orange is your favorite. Currently my favorite. Yeah, Mr. But hey, man, you know, teach their own

3808
03:28:32.72 --> 03:28:37.92
and we're going to move forward. So what this is though, discipline go in a can, energy drink,

3809
03:28:37.92 --> 03:28:44.32
health energy drink, healthy energy drink, no health drink in the form of energy drink. Yeah,

3810
03:28:44.32 --> 03:28:50.48
it's been hard to figure out what to call it. Whatever you are just saying, Steve was pretty

3811
03:28:50.48 --> 03:28:55.60
legit about just going down the road, finding words and everything. No, okay, so I'm like, yeah,

3812
03:28:55.60 --> 03:29:01.28
I know what your feeling is. Yeah, and that's what makes like the, the can so good. Because you're

3813
03:29:01.28 --> 03:29:06.16
not like, let's face it. You're just doing whatever during the day, whatever we do during the day.

3814
03:29:06.16 --> 03:29:12.64
You're like, oh, you know, I'll grab a water or grab a juice, grab a soda, sometimes, some of us,

3815
03:29:12.64 --> 03:29:18.56
no, this, this exactly right though. This is like you can grab it. No, you don't get the bad parts of

3816
03:29:18.56 --> 03:29:22.72
soda. Yeah, you know, I mean, yeah, if you're going for a water cool man, do it. But if you're

3817
03:29:22.72 --> 03:29:29.20
grabbing like a red bull, or I shouldn't say any particular brand, but you're grabbing a soda or

3818
03:29:29.20 --> 03:29:33.84
a energy drink, just saying you're going to pay a price for that. Your pain of price,

3819
03:29:33.84 --> 03:29:39.20
your pain of price with your health. Yeah, and with this discipline, go, it's pain you would think

3820
03:29:39.20 --> 03:29:44.40
that somebody would have already made an equivalent, right? You would think you'd think that.

3821
03:29:44.40 --> 03:29:48.32
It's real obvious. Hey, I'm going to make something that makes you a enhances your performance,

3822
03:29:48.32 --> 03:29:52.40
but it's actually good for you. You'd think somebody would have met done that. Why didn't they do it?

3823
03:29:52.40 --> 03:29:56.88
Number one, cost too much. Another, now they're not making, they're not maximizing profits at

3824
03:29:56.88 --> 03:30:02.88
the freaking cash register. Yeah, that's true. And number two is hard. It was hard to do because we

3825
03:30:02.88 --> 03:30:06.32
had to instead of just throwing a bunch of chemicals in there. So it wouldn't go bad. We had to

3826
03:30:06.32 --> 03:30:12.40
pasteize it, which no one does. So there you go. And you're not only that, hey, well, how you

3827
03:30:12.40 --> 03:30:17.04
going to make it taste good? Well, we'll just put a bunch of chemicals in there that are bad for you,

3828
03:30:17.04 --> 03:30:20.72
but they'll make people taste good. And we don't care about the people that we're serving this, too.

3829
03:30:20.72 --> 03:30:28.96
So we'll just let them drink poison. What did we do? We said, I was like, no, we're not doing that.

3830
03:30:28.96 --> 03:30:34.56
We're going to sweeten it with something real, it's monk fruit. So that's why it doesn't even

3831
03:30:34.56 --> 03:30:38.32
that doesn't seem like a lot of barriers to entry, right? Like, hey, we're going to pass tries.

3832
03:30:38.32 --> 03:30:42.56
They're, we're going to put, we're going to sweeten it naturally. We're going to only put healthy

3833
03:30:42.56 --> 03:30:48.32
ingredients in it. You'd think that those, those bars to entry aren't that high. You'd think someone

3834
03:30:48.32 --> 03:30:54.80
would have done it, but they didn't, they didn't do it. So we did. Like I said, now everyone else can

3835
03:30:54.80 --> 03:31:01.04
get in line. As far as getting in line goes for sure. Also speaking of tasting good, monk,

3836
03:31:01.04 --> 03:31:09.84
some pure your protein and the form of a dessert. So you know, you know, I such a good dessert.

3837
03:31:09.84 --> 03:31:15.76
Yeah, very much so so, I don't even know if I'm supposed to say this, but Brian sends my son and me.

3838
03:31:16.40 --> 03:31:20.80
I'm more of a secondary thing, but it sends my son, monk bars. Oh yeah. I don't know if

3839
03:31:20.80 --> 03:31:25.36
they're still in the experimental stage. The version that you're getting right now is pretty close to a

3840
03:31:25.36 --> 03:31:31.28
done deal. Yeah. So it's like it's one of those things where you get man, if you want to dessert,

3841
03:31:31.92 --> 03:31:36.56
like monk is the dessert and it's super as far as like, you know, like sometimes you're like,

3842
03:31:36.56 --> 03:31:40.96
I need a dessert, but I, you know, I'm on the pass. So I'm going to have a dessert substitute or something

3843
03:31:40.96 --> 03:31:44.72
like this. You know what I'm saying? You had those out. I thought those were out already.

3844
03:31:44.72 --> 03:31:51.36
Mostly bars. Yeah, was eating something back in December last year. We were in the experimental phase.

3845
03:31:51.36 --> 03:31:56.32
Well, they were tasty. Yeah. They've gotten better. Wow. They've gotten better. So it's been hard,

3846
03:31:56.32 --> 03:32:00.64
man. It's been really hard. There's a, it's the same. It's the same kind of battles you're fighting

3847
03:32:01.20 --> 03:32:06.000
with the, like, with, with making the drink and how do you actually keep it stable? There's more,

3848
03:32:06.000 --> 03:32:09.60
there's, well, it's not more, but there's different things in play trying to make a bar. How do you

3849
03:32:09.60 --> 03:32:13.36
keep it stable? How does it maintain its texture over time? What happens when it's sitting on the

3850
03:32:13.36 --> 03:32:17.04
shelf for two months? There's a bunch of things to deal with. So we find in the version that you're

3851
03:32:17.04 --> 03:32:22.32
getting right now. Echo, we find we figured out how to overcome all that and do it naturally and

3852
03:32:22.32 --> 03:32:29.12
make it taste good and have the right flavor profile and stay stable on the shelf. So it's been a

3853
03:32:29.12 --> 03:32:34.08
long road. It's been a road that we almost back away from. And you know me, I'm not one to,

3854
03:32:35.28 --> 03:32:40.96
DOR. DOR is this. Sure. Yeah. But either way, yes,

3855
03:32:40.96 --> 03:32:48.08
smoke, protein, the form of dessert, not a dessert substitute by the way. Just simply dessert. Straight up.

3856
03:32:48.08 --> 03:32:55.68
Where do you get all this stuff? Origin main.com originally originally as many other places to get it,

3857
03:32:55.68 --> 03:33:00.32
but before we go there, okay, let's go here. Jocco, wait, you mentioned the Pumagranto,

3858
03:33:00.32 --> 03:33:05.44
wait, T. Jocco, wait, T. That is available. We're not just talking about Jocco, you used to drink

3859
03:33:05.44 --> 03:33:11.76
white tea now. He doesn't. Yeah. Drink even better. I had a double white tea. Yeah, remember you

3860
03:33:11.76 --> 03:33:17.84
still drink it in that big jar. So bring the big jar. Oh, I just bring it back in the day. Like a crazy person.

3861
03:33:17.84 --> 03:33:25.04
Yeah. Yeah. Nonetheless, yes, that's available as well at origami.com also at the Vitamin Shop offline.

3862
03:33:26.48 --> 03:33:32.40
What do you call it like brick and retail? Yeah, boom, Vitamin Shop, go get it. Also,

3863
03:33:32.40 --> 03:33:38.64
the discipline go cans. All right, wow, wow. In Florida currently. Yeah. And by the way, if you live in Florida

3864
03:33:39.28 --> 03:33:45.76
and you've been and look, I ask and said, hey, please, this is the mission. We want to we want to go

3865
03:33:45.76 --> 03:33:52.32
into the full chain of rawa. We needed to go hard in Florida. We needed to go in there clear shelves.

3866
03:33:52.32 --> 03:33:58.64
Well, you all that I've been clearing shelves. Thank you. Keep going. We're on the path to victory.

3867
03:33:58.64 --> 03:34:06.56
Don't let up. Let's keep getting after it. Because you know why? Because people in Pennsylvania

3868
03:34:06.56 --> 03:34:12.88
and New Jersey and Maryland, they're they're counting on Florida. It's all eyes on Florida. We got a rock

3869
03:34:12.88 --> 03:34:19.28
and roll in Florida. We're on the right path. Don't let up. But it's true. And the thing is again,

3870
03:34:19.28 --> 03:34:24.96
I said it for it's kind of a big deal though to go and get like an energy drink or whatever and it

3871
03:34:24.96 --> 03:34:30.40
be legitimate and healthy for you. It's guys a huge deal. I like you didn't even really have to think about.

3872
03:34:30.40 --> 03:34:34.88
But it might be just went back. I mean, we were talking about that 15 minutes ago, but we're talking

3873
03:34:34.88 --> 03:34:39.92
about it again. That's cool. I don't think I'm a capitalite, not capitalized. I broke down the entire thing

3874
03:34:39.92 --> 03:34:44.000
about the bars and the thing we got to do and how hard it was. Yeah, but that wasn't good enough.

3875
03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:48.80
But not about the price you pay when you when you take drink and energy drink or a soda or something like this.

3876
03:34:48.80 --> 03:34:54.16
That price you pay versus the price that you don't pay. That's a big deal. I then think I maximize

3877
03:34:54.16 --> 03:35:01.76
the how should I say the communication of that big deal. Check. I think I have no. Okay. Also at originmain.com

3878
03:35:01.76 --> 03:35:07.04
is American made stuff. Do you get some stuff? Geese, rash cards, some athletic skills.

3879
03:35:07.04 --> 03:35:10.40
Good question. Can you wear a ghee when you go to the grocery market?

3880
03:35:10.40 --> 03:35:16.64
Gross. Yeah, well as far as gross you're smart to go. Yeah, sure. I mean, you could technically.

3881
03:35:17.28 --> 03:35:22.96
Ifizable? Well, you know, I'm not going to sit here and advise that, but man, if you're going to do it,

3882
03:35:22.96 --> 03:35:28.40
go ahead do that. Okay. Was there something that we could wear that would be more acceptable? Sure.

3883
03:35:28.40 --> 03:35:33.84
Like what? Maybe some jeans. Ah, there we go. There we go. Maybe I don't know. But maybe. Yeah.

3884
03:35:33.84 --> 03:35:39.04
So where can you get American made jeans? You know, it's very hard. What I should I say is far as

3885
03:35:39.04 --> 03:35:45.68
options go. There are not as many options as you know, one might hope. But thankfully, yes, I am here to tell

3923
03:39:43.60 --> 03:39:48.000
Canvas dot com. Got a bunch of books. We talked about one of them today. We talked about a couple of

3924
03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:55.60
them today. But about face by Colonel David Hackworth. He highly recommended. There's a new version

3925
03:39:55.60 --> 03:40:02.88
that has a forward in it written by me. I'm now freaking stoked. I was to do that, man.

3926
03:40:04.08 --> 03:40:08.72
Did I tell you that? How that happened? No. They were. So, it started selling again kind of like

3927
03:40:08.72 --> 03:40:12.88
when I started talking about it all the time. And so they eventually pulled the thread and tried

3928
03:40:12.88 --> 03:40:16.56
to figure out why it was selling. And they eventually figured out what was selling because

3929
03:40:17.20 --> 03:40:23.28
we were talking about all the time on the podcast. And they wrote me and said, hey, do you want to

3930
03:40:23.28 --> 03:40:27.60
write? We're going to re-release it. Do you want to write a blur for the back, which is like a little

3931
03:40:27.60 --> 03:40:32.48
quote? Like, hey, this is a great book. And I wrote them and said, uh, I'll write, can I write a

3932
03:40:32.48 --> 03:40:36.96
forward to it? And they'd be like, you want to write a forward? I said, hell, yeah, I'll write a forward to it.

3933
03:40:36.96 --> 03:40:42.40
Most forwards are about 500 words. If you Google, like, how long should a book for it be?

3934
03:40:42.40 --> 03:40:48.32
It should be about 500 words. My forward for this is $5,000. Yeah, it's like a

3935
03:40:48.32 --> 03:40:54.16
really good. Because I just went off and explained how I found it when it meant, you know, all these

3936
03:40:54.16 --> 03:41:00.32
lessons I learned from it. And so yeah, it's been, it's been awesome. So if you want to check out

3937
03:41:00.32 --> 03:41:05.20
that book about face by Colonel David Hackworth, then go ahead and check that out. Also leadership

3938
03:41:05.20 --> 03:41:12.80
strategy and tactics field manual. So good. You, what, you just had a company that told you

3939
03:41:12.80 --> 03:41:18.72
what they just said. Yeah, well, so they'd already, they read extreme ownership in their

3940
03:41:18.72 --> 03:41:22.16
leadership team as them. They have the decademy leadership. And I was like, hey, do you guys have

3941
03:41:22.16 --> 03:41:27.12
leadership strategies and tactics? And they want to have them purchased it. They're like, yeah,

3942
03:41:27.12 --> 03:41:30.88
they're inbound. You got them for the whole thing. And the beautiful thing with it is,

3943
03:41:31.44 --> 03:41:36.16
you got an issue. You can find it in that book with a good solution. It might not be a

3944
03:41:36.16 --> 03:41:42.24
100% solution for your situation, but you can take that formulated and utilize it. That's the

3945
03:41:42.24 --> 03:41:47.68
beauty of that thing. Yeah, that's so powerful. That's exactly what I had in mind when I wrote it.

3946
03:41:47.68 --> 03:41:52.96
Was can you look up in here? Yeah. Okay. Let me go. I'm having a problem with my subordinate.

3947
03:41:52.96 --> 03:41:57.12
What, how do I do? What do I do? You know, I'm having a problem with people getting on board

3948
03:41:57.12 --> 03:42:01.12
with a new plan. What do I do? And just be able to look it up in there, find the solution.

3949
03:42:01.12 --> 03:42:05.92
The, the beautiful thing about it is you don't even have to tab it because the answers are

3950
03:42:05.92 --> 03:42:10.80
up front. Hey, you're having this issue flipped to this page. And in a, in a, in a, one to two pages,

3951
03:42:10.80 --> 03:42:15.52
you find your answer. You read through it, digest it, boom, implement it. So easy. Check.

3952
03:42:18.88 --> 03:42:25.04
The code, the evaluations, the protocol, few needs some guidance on where to go. Look in the

3953
03:42:25.04 --> 03:42:28.96
military, we got told, hey, you're slacking a little here. You could do a little better here. But we

3954
03:42:28.96 --> 03:42:34.16
go through life without an evaluation of ourselves. How you expect to know where to go? Get the code,

3955
03:42:34.16 --> 03:42:39.20
the evaluation of protocol. Get the discipline equals freedom, field manual, new version,

3956
03:42:39.20 --> 03:42:46.56
bigger picture of my head. Yes. Therefore, you know, obviously better. Another 35 or 40 pages

3957
03:42:46.56 --> 03:42:55.44
of writing in there. I deal. I'm going to say it. I don't like to throw that out there. But kind of an

3958
03:42:55.44 --> 03:43:00.56
ideal gift book, right? It's not just like, oh, I went to the book store and randomly found this book

3959
03:43:00.56 --> 03:43:05.04
over here called whatever. Oh, it's like, I got something with a little substance. It's a little

3960
03:43:05.04 --> 03:43:11.20
bigger, it's a little heavier. Looks cool. Looks cool. You could put it on a table and just have it be there.

3961
03:43:12.16 --> 03:43:18.64
And if you read it, you're doing even better. Yes, sir. What up? So I got this. You, you gave me a

3962
03:43:18.64 --> 03:43:23.20
sign copy a few years ago. Oh, I'm just trying to see what the difference is. Oh, yeah. Well,

3963
03:43:23.20 --> 03:43:29.60
the difference is there's about 40 extra pages of what I wrote more stuff. Gotcha. More information.

3964
03:43:29.60 --> 03:43:37.04
So there's that. And then also there's a way of the war. Your kid for field manual, which is what

3965
03:43:37.04 --> 03:43:43.04
your kid wants for Christmas. That's what your kid wants for Christmas. Because all these lessons

3966
03:43:43.04 --> 03:43:47.20
that we talk about, look, you can learn them when you're 40 after you read, freaking,

3967
03:43:47.20 --> 03:43:52.64
leadership strategy and tactics, or you can learn them when you're seven. And you can go through

3968
03:43:52.64 --> 03:43:57.20
life, understanding these things. And you can end up in a much better place. So what do you

3969
03:43:57.20 --> 03:44:03.52
can do with your kid? You're going to put them on a path to mediocracy, mediocracy, or you're going

3970
03:44:03.52 --> 03:44:08.08
to put your kid on a path to being average, or you're going to be put your kid on a path to blame

3971
03:44:08.08 --> 03:44:12.24
other people and be a victim in their whole life, or you're going to put them on the path to be a

I know. What are you hunting for? Ducks. Right on. It's fun. And it's good living.

4015
03:48:49.60 --> 03:48:57.20
today about setting a good example, modeling the right example. And you also notice that almost

4016
03:48:57.20 --> 03:49:06.24
every phase of his life he talked about learning and how he learned. Well, I would say that's part

4017
03:49:06.24 --> 03:49:13.12
of that good example is don't ever stop learning. Don't ever stop growing. Don't ever stop trying to

4018
03:49:13.12 --> 03:49:23.04
improve. You can only do that if you stay humble. So stay humble. Listen, learn and lead and also

4019
03:49:24.08 --> 03:49:33.12
make sure that you keep getting after it. And until next time, this is Steve and echo and

03:49:33.12 --> 03:49:35.12
jacco out.
