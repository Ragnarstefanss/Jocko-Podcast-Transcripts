00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.28 This is Jocco podcast, number 88.
00:00:04.28 --> 00:00:07.84 With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
00:00:07.84 --> 00:00:08.84 Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:09.84 Good evening.
00:00:13.84 --> 00:00:18.20 I went into a public house to get a plane of beer.
00:00:18.20 --> 00:00:23.76 The public anye up and says, we serve no red coats here.
00:00:23.76 --> 00:00:29.44 The girls behind the bar, they laughed and giggled fit to die.
00:00:29.44 --> 00:00:32.20 I outstint to the streets again.
00:00:32.20 --> 00:00:39.000 And to myself says, I, oh, it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy go away.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.88 But it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.
00:00:43.88 --> 00:00:48.04 When the band begins to play, my boys, the band begins to play.
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:55.40 Oh, it's thank you, Mr. Actons, when the band begins to play.
00:00:55.40 --> 00:00:59.44 I went into a theater as sober as could be.
00:00:59.44 --> 00:01:05.64 They gave a drunk civilian room, but they hadn't known for me.
00:01:05.64 --> 00:01:10.76 They sent me to the gallery around the music halls.
00:01:10.76 --> 00:01:15.44 But when it comes to fighting Lord, they shoved me in the stalls.
00:01:15.44 --> 00:01:19.32 For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy wait outside.
00:01:19.32 --> 00:01:24.68 But it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.
00:01:24.68 --> 00:01:29.72 The trooperships on the tide, my boys, the trooperships on the tide.
00:01:29.72 --> 00:01:36.52 Oh, it's special train for Actons when the troopers on the tide.
00:01:36.52 --> 00:01:41.96 Yes, make and mock a uniforms that guard you while you sleep.
00:01:41.96 --> 00:01:46.76 Is cheaper than them uniforms in their starvation cheap.
00:01:46.76 --> 00:01:51.64 And hustling drunken soldiers when they're going large a bit
00:01:51.64 --> 00:01:56.28 as five times better business than parade in full kit.
00:01:56.28 --> 00:02:01.48 Then it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy house your soul.
00:02:01.48 --> 00:02:06.32 But it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.
00:02:06.32 --> 00:02:11.08 The drums begin to roll, my boys, the drums begin to roll.
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:17.28 Oh, it's thin red line of eros when the drums begin to roll.
00:02:17.28 --> 00:02:20.96 We are no thin red eros.
00:02:20.96 --> 00:02:24.08 No, we aren't no black guards too.
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:29.32 But single men and barracks most remarkable like you.
00:02:29.32 --> 00:02:34.64 And if sometimes our conduct is an all-year fancy paints,
00:02:34.64 --> 00:02:40.08 why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:45.000 While it's Tommy this and Tommy that and Tommy fall behind.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.68 But it's please walk in the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.
00:02:49.68 --> 00:02:53.20 When there's trouble in the wind, my boys, there's trouble in the wind.
00:02:53.20 --> 00:02:59.92 Oh, it's please walk to the front sir when there's trouble in the wind.
00:02:59.92 --> 00:03:05.44 You talk a better food for us and schools and fires and all.
00:03:05.44 --> 00:03:09.68 We'll rate for extra rations if you treat us rational.
00:03:09.68 --> 00:03:14.72 Don't mess about the cookroom slops but prove it to our face.
00:03:14.72 --> 00:03:20.32 The widows uniform is not the soldier's men's disgrace.
00:03:20.32 --> 00:03:25.12 For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and chuck him out the brute.
00:03:25.12 --> 00:03:29.60 But it's safe your other country when the guns begin to shoot.
00:03:29.60 --> 00:03:33.84 And it's Tommy this and Tommy that and anything you please.
00:03:33.84 --> 00:03:36.88 And Tommy ain't a blooming fool.
00:03:36.88 --> 00:03:45.52 You bet that Tommy sees.
00:03:45.52 --> 00:03:52.80 And that is another poem from Kippling.
00:03:52.80 --> 00:03:57.44 It's actually one of my favorites from Kippling.
00:03:57.44 --> 00:04:02.24 And you can follow it and you can go back and read through it,
00:04:02.24 --> 00:04:09.60 look it up online and it's explaining how the soldier doesn't get me respect during peace time.
00:04:11.60 --> 00:04:17.12 But when it's time to fight, when the troop ship is on the tide,
00:04:17.12 --> 00:04:22.56 then it's Tommy, which is slang for the British soldier, then it's Tommy to the front of a line.
00:04:22.56 --> 00:04:32.24 But the point that I wanted to focus on is the line in the poem where it says,
00:04:32.24 --> 00:04:37.28 and if sometimes our conduct is in all your fancy paints,
00:04:39.12 --> 00:04:42.72 why single men and barracks don't grow into plaster saints.
00:04:42.72 --> 00:04:52.48 And what that means is that soldiers and marines and sailors and those men that go out
00:04:52.48 --> 00:04:56.88 into harm's way voluntarily, they're not always boy scouts.
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:00.72 They're not going to be plaster saints.
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:04.96 You know plaster saint, like you have, the little statue of a saint of a Christian saint.
00:05:07.28 --> 00:05:10.56 The soldiers are going to be a little rough around the edges.
00:05:10.56 --> 00:05:14.24 They might be a little bit rowdy, they might be a little bit brash, they might be a little bit
00:05:14.24 --> 00:05:16.16 drunk, they might be trouble makers.
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:21.60 Now they're not all like that, obviously.
00:05:23.28 --> 00:05:24.08 But some of them are.
00:05:25.76 --> 00:05:28.08 And guess what? Who else is going to go forward?
00:05:30.32 --> 00:05:33.68 Who else is going to go put their life on the line?
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.08 It's these guys. And by the way, when you are raised in barracks,
00:05:40.08 --> 00:05:46.56 a single man in barracks, you're going to find some trouble from time to time.
00:05:47.44 --> 00:05:50.64 And then once you take these young men and you put them in a battle,
00:05:52.48 --> 00:05:59.84 once you subject them to fear and terror and death,
00:05:59.84 --> 00:06:07.28 can we assume now and expect them to act like saints?
00:06:10.32 --> 00:06:15.12 Can we somehow expect that their behavior is now going to transition to becoming beyond
00:06:16.08 --> 00:06:18.88 reproach in the way they carry themselves?
00:06:21.44 --> 00:06:23.28 I don't think that's a realistic outlook.
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:33.04 Now the book that we're going to look at today is an example of war and it shows once again that war
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:35.76 is brutal.
00:06:38.16 --> 00:06:43.68 Not just in actions, but also in attitude, in language.
00:06:45.28 --> 00:06:50.88 And in the way it impacts men both physically and mentally.
00:06:50.88 --> 00:06:58.56 And this book is raw, it's graphic, it's brutish and it's real.
00:07:00.64 --> 00:07:04.16 And the language that's in it, that's offensive. I leave it in.
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:09.60 Why? Because war is offensive.
00:07:11.44 --> 00:07:16.48 And the language used in war is also offensive and if you don't want to hear offensive
00:07:16.48 --> 00:07:24.80 language or graphic descriptions or completely politically incorrect statements being made,
00:07:24.80 --> 00:07:33.76 then don't listen to this podcast. The book is called Excursion in Hell.
00:07:36.80 --> 00:07:45.36 And it tracks the experience of its author, or guy by the name of Vincent Bramley,
00:07:45.36 --> 00:07:56.24 who's a young corporal in third battalion of the British armies, parachute regimen,
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:59.12 otherwise known as the three Paris.
00:08:03.36 --> 00:08:11.28 Now the book starts off kind of with the way the the Falkland Islands is starting to escalate
00:08:11.28 --> 00:08:15.68 and as it's starting to escalate, they get put on their England.
00:08:16.16 --> 00:08:24.64 The three Paris get put onto a cruise ship, a chartered cruise ship called the SS Cannebara
00:08:24.64 --> 00:08:30.88 and their sailing south towards the Falkland Islands. And now we, they're starting to get
00:08:30.88 --> 00:08:34.32 information, they're starting to get intelligence and start to get briefed on what's happening.
00:08:34.32 --> 00:08:37.68 Because these guys didn't even know where the Falkland Islands were. I mean, a lot of them,
00:08:37.68 --> 00:08:41.20 they didn't know where they were. Some random island out in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't
00:08:41.20 --> 00:08:44.64 find it on a map, a lot of them. Well now they're definitely looking at it and they're trying
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:50.08 to figure out what's going on there. So, they're starting to get some of these briefs. We're going
00:08:50.08 --> 00:08:57.52 to the book now. Our lectures were in the early afternoon now. The most memorable was by some of the
00:08:57.52 --> 00:09:01.52 very keen Marines who had been serving in the Falklands at the time of the invasion.
00:09:01.52 --> 00:09:07.84 The Falkland Islands were in a British, I guess you'd call it a colony, but not a colony. It's
00:09:09.44 --> 00:09:18.56 a little British, it was owned by the British at the time. And the Argentinians invaded it.
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:27.68 So, here we go. Obviously, listening to first-hand experience was better than listening to
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:33.76 some officer lecturing us on his personal beliefs at the time. However, an intelligence officer
00:09:33.76 --> 00:09:38.56 from way up top gave a graphic account of what the RGs that's what they call the Argentinians. The
00:09:38.56 --> 00:09:44.88 RGs were up to at the time. The intelligence constantly coming in was essential to all levels.
00:09:46.08 --> 00:09:51.76 What I remember most about this lecture was the officer standing proudly in front of us saying
00:09:51.76 --> 00:09:58.56 the Argentin Army is the best and strongest in South America. He told us you will be in for a big
00:09:58.56 --> 00:10:04.80 scrap if it comes to war jense. Have no qualms about it. At the last recorded reports,
00:10:04.80 --> 00:10:10.48 the RGs have about 9,000 men in fortified positions around Stanley, the capital.
00:10:11.60 --> 00:10:17.28 But we also have good reports that they are underfed, Morales low, and they have taken a eating
00:10:17.28 --> 00:10:23.12 horses and sheep, which they have been stealing from the inhabitants. That's the local people
00:10:23.12 --> 00:10:29.84 that lived on the Falkland Islands. This tells us that they are very undisciplined and goes to
00:10:29.84 --> 00:10:34.24 show that conscription is going to be their mistakes. So, they have some of their soldiers are
00:10:34.24 --> 00:10:43.04 conscripts, meaning they're forced into the army. Like a draft? Like, yes. My immediate feelings
00:10:43.04 --> 00:10:51.28 were 9,000 fucking men, and we only have 2 or 3,000. What the fuck is the big brass up to?
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:58.96 So, what was interesting about this is one of the things that I really
00:10:58.96 --> 00:11:03.60 this reminded me of is these guys have never been to work before. That matter fact he doesn't even
00:11:03.60 --> 00:11:10.96 mention anyone that has any prior combat experience. So, this reminds me of when I was on all my
00:11:10.96 --> 00:11:15.28 first deployments. Like, I talked about being off the coast of Somalia. I talked about being off
00:11:15.28 --> 00:11:21.52 the coast of Rwanda. And that's the position that these guys were in. And what our mindset was,
00:11:21.52 --> 00:11:27.44 if I was to go into Rwanda when I was a kid, when I was, you know, however old I was 22 years old,
00:11:27.44 --> 00:11:32.48 never been in combat before, I would be completely different person than if I went in right now
00:11:32.48 --> 00:11:36.48 with my, you know, all the things that we talked about all the time. I mean, I would be, I just
00:11:36.48 --> 00:11:44.56 understand combat. I understand Warbetter. I'm 45 years old. I've been in combat leadership positions,
00:11:44.56 --> 00:11:50.48 been in fire fights. I understand these things. It might add it to you to be completely different.
00:11:51.44 --> 00:11:59.44 Almost completely different than it would be than it was when I was 22 or 23 years old,
00:11:59.44 --> 00:12:03.60 sitting there fired up with a million rounds. And, you know, it's like, Lave talking, I've ever,
00:12:03.60 --> 00:12:08.08 you know, getting ready to go into Somalia or Rwanda, I had like hundreds of pounds of gear,
00:12:08.08 --> 00:12:13.12 grenades. We were so loaded. I was too heavy. Because we're, if I were going to World War 3.
00:12:14.08 --> 00:12:19.44 And that's the, that's what these guys are like. They don't, they're, they're, they're,
00:12:19.44 --> 00:12:24.56 they just don't, they never in a combat. And I think, you know, everything. Yeah, they're trying to be
00:12:24.56 --> 00:12:28.72 ready for everything. And, and just their attitude, and you can see it actually carries through
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:34.72 this thing is almost like, and this is what he says too. A lot of times it's almost like they're on
00:12:34.72 --> 00:12:39.68 this giant, really hard training exercise. Obviously it turns very,
00:12:40.64 --> 00:12:47.84 sour at some points and very much, much more beyond that. But this is what a lot of this reminds
00:12:47.84 --> 00:12:52.64 me of these guys. Now, some of these guys have been in, I guess the combat experience that these
00:12:52.64 --> 00:12:55.76 guys would have had, and I, and I should have remembered this. I didn't, you know what these guys
00:12:55.76 --> 00:12:59.60 had combat experience, they had combat experience from being in Northern Ireland. So most of them
00:12:59.60 --> 00:13:04.40 had done deployments over in the Northern Ireland. But I think that was a little bit more of a,
00:13:05.92 --> 00:13:10.48 not, it's not, it's not the full kind of combat that are about to get engaged in here. So,
00:13:12.32 --> 00:13:20.16 that's what it reminds me of here in the way they're talking. All right. So, back to the book on
00:13:20.16 --> 00:13:29.52 three May the submarine HMS conquer sank the Argentinian ship general Belgrano with a loss of about
00:13:29.52 --> 00:13:35.76 300 lives. When this news was first brought to us, we were skeptical thinking, yeah, okay.
00:13:37.04 --> 00:13:42.88 Once the news was official, it wasn't greeted with total enthusiasm. In the bar that night,
00:13:42.88 --> 00:13:50.72 most of us were solemn. We now knew war was inevitable. They have a bar. It's a cruise ship that
00:13:50.72 --> 00:13:53.92 they're on. So they have a bar and they're drinking. They're getting some allotment of beers in there.
00:13:53.92 --> 00:13:58.72 That's where they're hanging out. But all of a sudden this is real. You know, you don't kill 300,
00:13:58.72 --> 00:14:03.60 you know, enemy sailors and think you're not going to go to war. And it comes back back to the
00:14:03.60 --> 00:14:09.28 book the night of four May while we were playing Bingo in the bar. News came that the HMS
00:14:09.28 --> 00:14:15.84 Sheffield had been hit by an RG exeset, which is a type of missile and was sinking. The loss of a
00:14:15.84 --> 00:14:21.20 hair your jet was also reported. The news hit the troops on board like a sledgehammer.
00:14:21.20 --> 00:14:26.96 Until now, everything we had heard had been in our favor. South Georgia had been retaken and the
00:14:26.96 --> 00:14:32.80 RG's submarine patrol boats had all been hit even their inland positions had been bombed by the navy
00:14:32.80 --> 00:14:38.96 and now the Belgrano, which was the ship that it sunk, sinking the Sheffield was the first of
00:14:38.96 --> 00:14:45.52 their strike backs. Moral in the bar that night swung from an incredible high to an almost
00:14:45.52 --> 00:14:53.28 sickening silence. And he talks about this, but the waiting, these guys are now,
00:14:53.28 --> 00:14:57.60 it's a long cruise down there. I think it takes about three or three weeks to get down.
00:14:58.88 --> 00:15:02.72 Back to the book, the day after the Sheffield's hit, we knew our weight was coming to an end.
00:15:03.60 --> 00:15:08.48 The atmosphere was quiet and a morale booster was now much needed. The only thing possible for the task
00:15:08.48 --> 00:15:15.04 force was revenge. The sinking of the Sheffield had hit us as if we had lost a personal friend,
00:15:15.04 --> 00:15:21.12 tension mounted, frustration showed in everyone's eyes. The fitness drills were now carried out
00:15:21.12 --> 00:15:26.80 in full kit and pounding the decks in the heat was gutty work. So the whole time they've been
00:15:26.80 --> 00:15:31.28 steaming down there, they've been out there running laps on the all the deck of the cruise,
00:15:31.28 --> 00:15:40.96 ship trying to get in shape for what's coming. Back to the book, the main info we picked up
00:15:40.96 --> 00:15:45.60 suggested a possible move on 20 May. So they're trying to figure out what's going on. They're
00:15:45.60 --> 00:15:49.60 down. These guys, you know, pretty low on the total pull, they're trying to figure out what's going
00:15:49.60 --> 00:15:52.80 on. They're hearing all these different rumors and now they picked up that maybe they're going to
00:15:52.80 --> 00:15:58.80 go on 20 May. Back to the book, our nerves now started. The move south was steady and without any
00:15:58.80 --> 00:16:06.48 real complications, but further south we went, the further we were going in. Somehow, I and many others
00:16:06.48 --> 00:16:11.44 still didn't quite believe the war was going to happen. We were lost in our own thoughts on many
00:16:11.44 --> 00:16:17.76 different subjects. Home became secondary now. I thought about the ifs and winds of our arrival
00:16:17.76 --> 00:16:23.84 in the exclusion zone and to the landings and battles to follow. Home was not my immediate thoughts.
00:16:23.84 --> 00:16:33.36 Survival was speculation was now rife as to what the landing procedure would be. We were still
00:16:33.36 --> 00:16:39.44 very much in the dark as to what was happening. But the next within the next 24 hours, all the bullshed,
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:44.56 rumors and personal beliefs were corrected by the platoon commander. Gents, he said,
00:16:45.36 --> 00:16:53.76 it's the green light. So they know they're now going in. And now they're getting
00:16:53.76 --> 00:16:59.36 into the serious preparations, packing and repacking to make our webbing as comfortable as possible.
00:16:59.36 --> 00:17:04.40 We began to psych ourselves up for the days ahead. It was nerve-racking beyond belief.
00:17:04.40 --> 00:17:09.60 Yet morale seemed remarkably high throughout the ship, though the laughing and joking among the
00:17:09.60 --> 00:17:15.92 lads was partly to cover the fear. Not that anyone thought death was going to hit him. That was
00:17:15.92 --> 00:17:21.92 for the guy you were talking to. Getting the common belief that the common belief that we hear
00:17:21.92 --> 00:17:30.64 quite a bit, which is not going to happen to me. And I will say this as I say it for all these
00:17:30.64 --> 00:17:37.20 shows that we do. I'm skipping a bunch of stuff. I'm giving you some of the high points, but the
00:17:37.20 --> 00:17:40.56 way he lays this out, the tension that he builds, he does an outstanding job,
00:17:42.88 --> 00:17:48.000 getting the tension and capturing it. And I'm going through it pretty quickly, but it's worth reading
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.08 because, and I think it's worth reading because if you're in one of these situations,
00:17:52.08 --> 00:17:55.68 especially when you're in charge of guys that have never been to combat before, this is what you
00:17:55.68 --> 00:18:02.16 got to, it gives you a good lessons about keeping guys informed about preparing them for combat
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:09.44 and keeping them with the right mindset going in. So now they actually transfer from the cruise ship
00:18:09.44 --> 00:18:13.84 now they get onto a warship and eventually they end up on a landing craft. That's, that's
00:18:13.84 --> 00:18:20.16 heading to shore because they're going to war. Again, I covered that what in six minutes right now,
00:18:20.72 --> 00:18:25.84 it's, it's much more well detailed in the book. But right now they're getting ready to
00:18:26.80 --> 00:18:32.32 do their landing. Back to the book. The area now looked like an overcrowded tube train. The
00:18:32.32 --> 00:18:36.96 troops had pushed so close together that you could count the blackheads on your neighbor's face.
00:18:36.96 --> 00:18:41.36 I sat on my kit observing the order to keep all noise down, no talking.
00:18:41.36 --> 00:18:48.40 I looked around, I looked around me at the hundreds of cammed faces so they got cammed camouflage
00:18:48.40 --> 00:18:55.28 paint on at hundreds of cammed faces all with big wide eyes. Each face told its own story.
00:18:55.28 --> 00:19:01.52 Each, each soldier had his own thoughts about the coming battle and the lads as the
00:19:01.52 --> 00:19:06.48 lads quietly sat about waiting, always waiting. The story of all soldiers.
00:19:06.48 --> 00:19:12.48 Myself, I couldn't help but think that it was still a joke and that we wouldn't be going to
00:19:12.48 --> 00:19:18.72 shore. My stomach was not and the nauseous, hard to control. The nervousness running through
00:19:18.72 --> 00:19:22.80 me was the worst of all waiting, waiting for that fucking green light.
00:19:24.16 --> 00:19:30.48 Doc Murdock, Doc Murdock sat next to me pulling faces like a comedian. Fuck off, Doc, I said,
00:19:30.48 --> 00:19:40.48 I've got the gidders. We've all got to go somewhere, then, don't worry. The frustration of waiting
00:19:40.48 --> 00:19:45.44 and all the hassles of the last six weeks disappeared as we watched in stunned silence.
00:19:45.44 --> 00:19:52.48 The battle for fanning head to our left. Fanning head was the RGOP near San Carlos.
00:19:52.48 --> 00:19:57.28 The SAS had mounted an attack there to allow our landings to go ahead without interference.
00:19:57.28 --> 00:20:02.80 The tracer rounds and naval bombardment on the tip of the bay brought us abruptly into the
00:20:02.80 --> 00:20:09.44 real world. Jesus, look at that. It's a fireworks display shouted a lad at the front of the craft.
00:20:10.48 --> 00:20:15.76 Shut up and face the coming beach. We hadn't noticed we were moving towards the beach. All heads
00:20:15.76 --> 00:20:20.64 had been turned to watch the battle. So that's a little wake-up call. They're going into
00:20:20.64 --> 00:20:27.76 do their beach landing and there's a massive firefight going on where the SAS is doing a hit. Now,
00:20:29.44 --> 00:20:34.96 as they get on, they do their landing their landing is on a post and they're starting to
00:20:34.96 --> 00:20:43.20 patrol movement towards one of their objectives. Here we go. When we passed San Carlos,
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:48.56 two gazelle helicopters had just been shot down by some of the fleeing enemy.
00:20:48.56 --> 00:20:54.08 Word very quickly went around that the crew had been shot in the water while trying to swim
00:20:54.08 --> 00:21:00.80 ashore. Our anger brought home the reality of war and introduced us to the type of enemy we would
00:21:00.80 --> 00:21:07.84 be fighting. I would personally felt that if we could have caught those responsible,
00:21:07.84 --> 00:21:16.08 we would have killed them for the cowardly act. So there's some,
00:21:16.08 --> 00:21:23.28 well, cowardly acts. I guess is the word used. So the guys are trying to swim to safety and
00:21:23.28 --> 00:21:31.52 they get shot in helicopter pilots. They get into a position and they they hold up for a while
00:21:31.52 --> 00:21:38.000 in a security position. Back to the book, guard sat behind the SF gun for two hours on,
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.44 for off, there's no sleep to be had. What with the cold rain, ponchos,
00:21:45.44 --> 00:21:49.44 flapping all over the place and everyone restlessly changing positions all the time.
00:21:50.80 --> 00:21:56.000 It was a great first night. So they're out there, they're freezing. It's, that's one thing. They
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.72 weren't really prepared for, they weren't really prepared for this cold weather.
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:08.24 And, but that's how they kick off. No enemy contact yet other than what they can see off in the
00:22:08.24 --> 00:22:16.40 distance. They get gathered up for a little morning meeting. Back to the book, Pete Gray,
00:22:17.20 --> 00:22:22.48 gathered the NCOs around him for a daily brief and informed us of the things we weren't interested in.
00:22:23.20 --> 00:22:29.60 But also informed us that A company and C company had had a blue on blue sometime earlier.
00:22:29.60 --> 00:22:36.24 Apparently, both companies had patrols out to look for the RGs who had escaped on our landing.
00:22:37.04 --> 00:22:40.88 One patrol had spotted the other and asked for mortars on their position seen.
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:45.68 In turn, the other company asked for artillery on the first company.
00:22:46.72 --> 00:22:51.60 So a battle between A company and C company both firing small arms at each other.
00:22:51.60 --> 00:22:59.44 Within minutes, the operations officer in charge realized the arrow, error, and radioed for a ceasefire.
00:23:00.96 --> 00:23:06.72 But not before three to four lads and been badly shot up to them suffering head wounds.
00:23:08.72 --> 00:23:16.000 The ops officer was temporarily removed from the task. So again, we got relatively unexperienced
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:24.32 guys. They're out there and again, obviously I highlight that because blue on blue is real thing.
00:23:25.92 --> 00:23:29.28 And people don't think it's going to happen. I think Laf was talking about this.
00:23:29.68 --> 00:23:32.48 If you would have asked someone in T.U. Bruser,
00:23:33.92 --> 00:23:38.000 he said, one of the chances that we're going to have a blue on blue on our deployment. People would have
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.84 been like zero percent. They would have the zero percent because it was that, that's that taboo.
00:23:43.84 --> 00:23:49.36 And the fact that, you know, there's a blue on blue that we talk about in extreme ownership,
00:23:49.36 --> 00:23:57.52 but there's blue on blues all the time in our body. And this is another example of how easy it is
00:23:57.52 --> 00:24:00.08 to have it happen between two companies in the same battalion.
00:24:00.08 --> 00:24:14.48 Hmm. Back to the book, well lads, bad news said Pete, the Atlantic conveyor has been sunk.
00:24:15.60 --> 00:24:19.28 How the fuck did that get hit as someone from the rear? You tell me,
00:24:20.24 --> 00:24:25.44 Pete wasn't a happy man nor were we for the ship had been carrying the chinooks and luxury
00:24:25.44 --> 00:24:34.72 kit like tents, overboots and so on. So there was a supply ship, well a ship that had a bunch of
00:24:34.72 --> 00:24:39.28 supplies on it, including helicopters and helicopters was what's supposed to transport the
00:24:39.28 --> 00:24:44.32 Paris around Falkland. That was the plan. That just got sunk. And not only to get sunk with the
00:24:44.32 --> 00:24:49.92 helicopter's on it, it got sunk with the things like tents and sleeping bags that's going to allow
00:24:49.92 --> 00:24:55.12 them to be, you know, operate comfortably in this cold environment. If you don't know where
00:24:55.12 --> 00:25:03.76 Falkland Islands is, it's down by Antarctica. Back to the book, some bastard should fall for this.
00:25:03.76 --> 00:25:10.08 We thought all that kit on one bloody ship. Bad news of our choppers being sunk hit us
00:25:10.08 --> 00:25:15.68 sorely and many of us were still thinking about it when Pete announced the next info. No choppers.
00:25:16.72 --> 00:25:24.08 So the big wigs have decided that we start walking ASAP like today. Pete gave us a break
00:25:24.08 --> 00:25:30.24 down of what was happening. Two parah was on the march to Goose Green. 45 commander were
00:25:30.24 --> 00:25:36.72 were to head north to a settlement called Douglas. We of three parah were to take Tiel inlet.
00:25:38.64 --> 00:25:44.32 Within an hour, all kit was packed tightly away. Last meals and bruised demolished, weapons
00:25:44.32 --> 00:25:50.08 oiled and ready and bunkers evacuated. Bruise. He's talking about tea.
00:25:50.08 --> 00:26:01.76 And the brits, if you don't know, they like their tea. It's epic. And I saw that with brits that I've
00:26:01.76 --> 00:26:05.68 worked with, obviously, I'm married to a brit, so I know how much they like tea and drink tea.
00:26:07.04 --> 00:26:13.68 I saw it overseas. Guys would be ready to brew tea at any given time. The first people
00:26:13.68 --> 00:26:19.52 the Sri Lankan, when I was working with the Sri Lankan guys back in the burr of Kronin. They
00:26:19.52 --> 00:26:24.96 have had the influence by the British army and by the British culture. Because that was a
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:30.24 British settlement for a long time. They got their tea on too. They would brew any, you know,
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:34.56 you need to take a break for 10 minutes. These guys would be over there with a little stove,
00:26:34.56 --> 00:26:40.48 little hex lamp brewing up a tea. So that's something that you're going to, and I'm talking
00:26:40.48 --> 00:26:46.16 about it now. I don't highlight as much as I could in this podcast, but that's what they're talking about.
00:26:46.16 --> 00:26:53.60 Having a cup of tea. Yeah, doing a brew. When I worked with guys, the SAS guys that would
00:26:53.60 --> 00:26:58.80 come and stay with us here, those guys were the same way. Get the brew tea on. Yeah, got to have
00:26:58.80 --> 00:27:08.24 the guy that had a cup of tea. Solid. Back to the book, we made our way up the prominent part
00:27:08.24 --> 00:27:13.92 of windy gap where most of the baton was gathering. The CSM, that's the command sergeant major
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:20.32 of B company was organizing which kit we were to carry and which to leave. No tried, no trypots
00:27:20.32 --> 00:27:25.36 for the SF guns and the SF guns are sustained fire guns. Basically a big heavy machine gun.
00:27:26.72 --> 00:27:32.16 That that takes a crew to operate. So you have a tripod. Someone cares the tripod. Someone cares
00:27:32.16 --> 00:27:34.88 the gun. Someone cares the ammunition. At least I think that's how they break it up.
00:27:36.80 --> 00:27:42.80 No trypots for the SF guns and no sleeping bags. No burdens. Bergen's is what the Brits
00:27:42.80 --> 00:27:50.56 call their big backpack or big rucksacks. All unnecessary weight to be left. We repacked our kit.
00:27:50.56 --> 00:27:55.36 The Bergen's and Tripods were centralized for a later pick-up. They were to be choppered
00:27:55.36 --> 00:28:02.48 forward if a chopper became available. We all felt pissed off about the conveyor being sunk
00:28:02.48 --> 00:28:09.04 and the prospect of the coming tab. So they call a march or hump they call it a tab.
00:28:09.04 --> 00:28:20.16 We were pissed off about the coming tab. We knew that the march would be about 50 kilometers.
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:27.20 But we were all glad to be moving breaking out across the island on the offensive. We set out at about
00:28:27.20 --> 00:28:30.96 two-thirty in the afternoon on what was to be an epic march for the regiment.
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:39.44 With the GPMG, that's a general purpose machine gun. Weeping order and ammo slung over
00:28:39.44 --> 00:28:44.16 every part of our bodies, we tabbed or rather hobbled as fast as we could.
00:28:45.04 --> 00:28:49.12 Once over the first hill we started to march around the side of an adjoining hill.
00:28:49.12 --> 00:28:54.000 At this time the Marines were walking alongside us ready to break northwards toward Douglas
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.88 towards the Douglas settlement. Unlike us, they carried full kit, Bergen's and all.
00:28:58.88 --> 00:29:04.08 Within 30 minutes we had a short break to let the stragglers catch up. A young Marine was
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:09.84 propped on his back beside me with his Bergen as a support. You lot have the right idea he said.
00:29:09.84 --> 00:29:16.32 No fucking extras. We look like donkeys here. I couldn't help but agree with him. But thought
00:29:16.32 --> 00:29:21.76 to myself that while we may move faster we'd be coldest at night. At that time I didn't
00:29:21.76 --> 00:29:31.84 know we'd be marching flat out all the way day and night. In less than an hour our bodies were
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:38.96 struggling under the weight of kit and ammo. The GPMG seemed away at ton. We swapped it on every
00:29:38.96 --> 00:29:43.60 short break within the first two hours. The night march orders were passed slowly back along the
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:49.92 length of the battalion that we'd be stopping for 15 minutes in every hour. Some even started clock
00:29:49.92 --> 00:29:56.08 watching. Our boots and wet socks were becoming unbearable to march in rubbing badly on the feet
00:29:56.08 --> 00:30:04.64 most. If not all of us. Blisters and spraying ankles added unexpectedly to the injury tool.
00:30:04.64 --> 00:30:09.92 I haven't done a good job of describing the terrain. It's miserable terrain. Just rocks,
00:30:10.72 --> 00:30:18.24 slippery rocks, big steep hills. It's go look at it on, you look at some images of what the terrain
00:30:18.24 --> 00:30:26.32 in the Falkland Islands is like. It's nightmare to patrol along. It's going to snow.
00:30:26.32 --> 00:30:34.000 It's not snowing yet but it's going to snow. It's actually in some ways worse. It's
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.52 worse to have because if it's cold enough that it's snowing snow is generally dry. If that makes
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:49.04 sense rain is rain. You get rained on your wet. If you get snowed on you can maintain your
00:30:49.04 --> 00:30:54.96 dryness. If you're in a really cold environment where it's snowing that's okay. It doesn't make
00:30:54.96 --> 00:31:03.12 you wet and wet makes you cold. It's the worst thing is right on that borderline between
00:31:03.12 --> 00:31:07.44 because then you get rained on but then when the sun goes down it turns into freezing. So this is the worst
00:31:07.44 --> 00:31:14.40 worst environment you could want for the situation that they're in and all they're given. They
00:31:14.40 --> 00:31:21.44 only have what limited gear they should have got sunk on a boat or it's in their burdens but
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:26.32 even the stuff that's in their burdens isn't the best winter equipment they would want. All that
00:31:26.32 --> 00:31:39.36 stuff got sunk. So he's got a guy that's starting to slack a little bit. His name is Taft.
00:31:39.36 --> 00:31:45.52 Taft moved up. Move up by screamed. I can't vent some fucked. I was losing my rag. I could see
00:31:45.52 --> 00:31:49.76 he was out of it but I couldn't stand the fact that he was going to let us down before we'd even
00:31:49.76 --> 00:31:54.48 got there. Taft was trying to keep up and mumbling out loud that he could do it if only we were
00:31:54.48 --> 00:32:00.16 to slow down a little bit but this was impossible. Nobody could tell the lead elements to slow down.
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:06.72 The gap got bigger, the swearing got louder. Taft wasn't the only one to feel the strain.
00:32:06.72 --> 00:32:13.44 Many of the lads were struggling. At last exhausted we stopped on the slope of yet another wind swept
00:32:13.44 --> 00:32:20.32 hill. Taft shook uncontrollably. He had a bad cramp and lay there totally out of the game.
00:32:20.32 --> 00:32:29.12 I informed the medics. Steve was sitting beside his usual when the unusual order came from the
00:32:29.12 --> 00:32:35.44 CO. The commanding officer. Brew up a hot cup of and make a snack. That was the order.
00:32:36.16 --> 00:32:40.80 This shocked a lot of us. Theoretically it was a no-no sitting in the middle of an advance
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:46.24 in the open and pitch dark practically though. It was the best order yet. A welcome brew was
00:32:46.24 --> 00:32:51.44 what we needed. The CO was obviously aware that the lads were suffering from the speed of the march.
00:32:53.84 --> 00:32:59.68 To me, Taft looked as though he was about to die. His nine stone frame wasn't strong enough
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:04.72 for the rest of the march. Taft could run the British, the army's British fitness test in
00:33:04.72 --> 00:33:11.28 around eight minutes and was considered our best runner. This proves as do other accounts I heard
00:33:11.28 --> 00:33:16.48 after the war that the fitness of troops cannot be determined by how fast they can run.
00:33:17.36 --> 00:33:22.16 The peros always pride themselves on tabbing with kit. That means marching with gear.
00:33:22.80 --> 00:33:29.20 And rightly so. But I learned to lesson on our first night's march. You must have body fat on
00:33:29.20 --> 00:33:35.20 you to waste for that kind of long tab that we had embarked on. So got a guy that's like,
00:33:35.20 --> 00:33:39.04 you know, a super thin triathlete. Now he's now you put a bunch of weight on him.
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:47.44 He's hurting. And I'll tell you that that also, that's a generalization too. That's not a waste
00:33:47.44 --> 00:33:53.36 too. I know some guys that were lean and could run fast and they could also haunt the rock. Like it was
00:33:53.36 --> 00:34:00.40 there, like it was there business. Now they start gathering up kind of the guys that
00:34:00.96 --> 00:34:05.60 can't continue and they lead, they actually leave these guys that can't continue in a
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:11.20 perimeter area. And then we're going back to the book. We slogged it out for another two or three
00:34:11.20 --> 00:34:17.60 hours of continuous hills, bogs, rocks, holes in the ground, everything that we could possibly,
00:34:17.60 --> 00:34:23.36 everything that could possibly make you trip or get wet. On top of the bloody awful terrain,
00:34:23.36 --> 00:34:30.16 we had the rain, sleet, wind and freezing climate to cope with. Exhausted and near the point of
00:34:30.16 --> 00:34:36.56 collapse, we came to the first man-made thing I'd seen, apart from the small houses at San Carlos.
00:34:36.56 --> 00:34:41.12 It was a barbed wire fence. There, right in the middle of nowhere, sat the fence,
00:34:41.12 --> 00:34:46.88 stretching far into the darkness on either side. Orders from above, told us to rest up until first
00:34:46.88 --> 00:34:51.20 light. We had been marching for 15 hours across the worst terrain you could imagine.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.04 Stephen, I attached our poncho with bunges, our ponchos with bunges to the fence and skitty,
00:34:59.04 --> 00:35:04.16 cave and johnny bashed up on the other side, creating a tent like accommodation. That's like
00:35:04.16 --> 00:35:10.56 their term for making shelter. We'd call it Bivvy Up, which is where we're going to sleep. They
00:35:10.56 --> 00:35:17.04 call it Bashed Up. We'd say Bivvy Up, here. We're going to Bivvy Up here. The rain hard for
00:35:17.04 --> 00:35:23.04 the remaining four hours of darkness. The wind blew the rain in on us as we all lay there trying
00:35:23.04 --> 00:35:29.68 to rest in the Bashar. But although we were exhausted, someone snoring, soon broken to my thoughts
00:35:29.68 --> 00:35:34.80 and outside around the Bashar little whispers could be heard, and other voices shouting for silence.
00:35:36.08 --> 00:35:41.28 I closed my eyes dreaming of a bath, clean sheets, and a letter from home. I didn't mind the
00:35:41.28 --> 00:35:46.000 rain as it hit my face. The chance to rest was welcome and I eventually managed to sleep.
00:35:46.64 --> 00:35:51.12 I was a woken by a nudge from skitty, who was already half packed and ready to move.
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:56.24 Steve and I crawled from our refuge and quietly packed our kit into our webbing.
00:35:57.12 --> 00:36:01.44 The rain and cold had shrunk the webbing so that it was difficult to fasten.
00:36:02.80 --> 00:36:09.92 Cold and numbness had us swearing out loud. We tapped over more hills,
00:36:10.88 --> 00:36:17.52 through more bogs and marshes. My legs ached more than I had fought possible. Steve was,
00:36:17.52 --> 00:36:23.52 if anything, better than me with the weight. Every time I started to struggle with the GPMG,
00:36:23.52 --> 00:36:27.60 he took it without complaining. Kary that weapon he could.
00:36:29.84 --> 00:36:36.16 So brutal march, they get to their next destination where they're going into a lay-up point or a
00:36:36.16 --> 00:36:40.64 perimeter where they're going to stop for a while. Back to the book, my stomach felt hollow.
00:36:40.64 --> 00:36:46.000 The wind and rain drain me of life. Lying there, feeling near to total exhaustion,
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.40 I couldn't even think of what was to come. The battle for Tiel inlet. My feet didn't exist any more.
00:36:52.40 --> 00:36:57.60 They were just two blocks of numbed ice attached to my legs, tapping them together, brought a
00:36:57.60 --> 00:37:04.000 pain that felt as if they would shatter and fall off. Steve lay next to me, lighting up a
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.84 fag, which is a cigarette. He looked up through the rain clouds at the dark and sky.
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:17.52 If we carry on at this rate, we'll all drop that of exhaustion he murmured. Steve said
00:37:17.52 --> 00:37:21.68 that he didn't want to look at his feet because they felt like they were falling off. I peeled
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:27.12 back my wet socks, saw blood on my right foot and discovered that the nail of my big toe was hanging
00:37:27.12 --> 00:37:33.84 off. Numbness had masked, what normally would have been agony. Cleunching my teeth, I pulled the nail
00:37:33.84 --> 00:37:44.08 away by its remaining roots. Soon, the shot went out that we were to get ready to move. We
00:37:44.08 --> 00:37:49.04 were moving earlier than expected to catch the last of the daylight. When I stood up, my body
00:37:49.04 --> 00:37:55.12 ached from head to foot. I was minus one toenail. I took up my kit and moved into line with the
00:37:55.12 --> 00:38:02.32 others ready to go the last 13 kilometers to Tiel. So far to take us about 14 hours to March
00:38:02.32 --> 00:38:11.36 40 odd kilometers. That was still good going. We set off very slowly spaced out in one long line.
00:38:12.08 --> 00:38:18.40 We hobbled over the hill in front of us only to see more hills and marshes. I began to become
00:38:18.40 --> 00:38:24.48 conscious of my toe and the more I thought about it, the worse it felt. However, the thought of
00:38:24.48 --> 00:38:31.52 dropping out at that stage seemed to fate worse than death and so I fought the pain. It's funny,
00:38:31.52 --> 00:38:37.20 looking back, but the further we went into the campaign, the less I thought of my home or family.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.72 I wasn't thinking of Queen and Country either. I fought of myself and the lads around me.
00:38:45.76 --> 00:38:51.28 Letting the side down was my biggest fear. That fear kept me walking.
00:38:55.36 --> 00:38:56.96 Just doesn't want to let his boys down.
00:38:56.96 --> 00:39:02.88 That's his driving force, not even thinking about his family anymore. Not thinking about God and
00:39:02.88 --> 00:39:05.52 Country. Not thinking about the Queen.
00:39:09.36 --> 00:39:14.08 Here's a little thing that I had to highlight. We were annoyed by the lack of info coming down the
00:39:14.08 --> 00:39:19.60 marching line to Tielus where we were and how far we had left the march. This is as the last
00:39:19.60 --> 00:39:26.08 night learned a long time ago. When I was a young junior guy in a pontoon and if you're in the
00:39:26.08 --> 00:39:28.96 back of the pontoon or you're in the back of the patrol and you don't know where you're going,
00:39:28.96 --> 00:39:33.52 it is the worst feeling. It's the worst feeling. You have no idea how much longer, where you're
00:39:33.52 --> 00:39:40.08 going, where you are. Not only is it a bad feeling for the people on your team. It's tactically
00:39:40.08 --> 00:39:43.84 unsound because they don't know where they are. What happens if you get contact, you get split up,
00:39:43.84 --> 00:39:46.40 where they're supposed to go, they don't even know where they're. What if they're going the wrong
00:39:46.40 --> 00:39:51.44 directions? They could get going to enemy formation. It's a horrible scenario.
00:39:51.44 --> 00:39:58.16 Obviously, as a leader in any position, you gotta think, does the back of your patrol know where
00:39:58.16 --> 00:40:02.72 you are? Does your company know where you are? I was working with a company recently. They had
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:10.000 that big transition to make. No one knew what quantified that transition. It just seemed like this
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.64 open-ended prospect and no one knew where it ended or what quantified, hey, we can move to the next phase.
00:40:18.64 --> 00:40:24.64 It was a tough phase that they were going through. Cutting costs and being restrictive on
00:40:24.64 --> 00:40:29.92 expenditures, I guess that is cutting costs, but getting rid of some people is a tough time.
00:40:31.04 --> 00:40:36.08 But no one knew when that was going to end. They knew that there was some kind of go-off
00:40:36.08 --> 00:40:40.40 there, but they didn't know what it was. That was really tough for them in the transition.
00:40:40.40 --> 00:40:44.96 I said, you need to set clear goals. If you know what they are, which is actually the leadership
00:40:44.96 --> 00:40:49.04 did know, they knew there was a certain line, a certain amount of costs that they needed to cut
00:40:49.04 --> 00:40:54.88 a certain operating expense that they needed to get down to, but they didn't tell anybody.
00:40:55.60 --> 00:40:59.28 So everyone just thought, well, we might just be cutting my job next or who, you know,
00:40:59.28 --> 00:41:04.16 how long am I going to be here? If we're just shutting down, I don't know. So keep your people
00:41:04.16 --> 00:41:08.32 informed. The people that are in the back end of your patrol, you gotta keep them informed.
00:41:10.32 --> 00:41:14.88 Back to the book, we came to a fourth river smaller than the rest and stumbled across
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:20.48 it in the dark. The cold water mixed with our sweat to cause yet more sores on our feet.
00:41:21.60 --> 00:41:25.60 We were now about one and a half kilometers from the settlement of Tiel inlet.
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:31.84 The agony of the marching disappeared quickly as it became clear that the task of the battle
00:41:31.84 --> 00:41:33.36 would soon confront us.
00:41:35.76 --> 00:41:41.68 And how does that go? One and a half hours of lying in the cold with the wind shooting through us
00:41:41.68 --> 00:41:45.84 was all the action they had that night. So they get to Tiel and Lett and really nothing really
00:41:45.84 --> 00:41:53.52 happens because the RGs had left. They do get some updates. Back to the book, we found out that
00:41:53.52 --> 00:41:58.80 some of the platoon had dropped out on the march. More importantly, though, Mick Coleman, one of our
00:41:58.80 --> 00:42:07.84 gunners had just been shot in the leg, not by the enemy, but by a knob in a company. So their first,
00:42:07.84 --> 00:42:12.72 you know, casualty besides someone getting hurt from marching is something that gets shot,
00:42:12.72 --> 00:42:18.80 one of my one of their own people. It's a knob just in a derogatory term for a tool.
00:42:20.64 --> 00:42:29.52 A turtleneck. It's not a military turn. It's not a official military
00:42:29.52 --> 00:42:40.08 doctrinal term knob. Just say a turt. The CO and his back to the book. The CO and his band of
00:42:40.08 --> 00:42:44.96 followers and spectatilines later that morning. So now they're dug in another position. We thought
00:42:44.96 --> 00:42:49.84 they might instruct us to move our trench or something. The usual thing, but we were still thinking
00:42:49.84 --> 00:42:54.24 is that we were on exercise. So classic point right there, the commanding officer comes around and
00:42:54.24 --> 00:42:57.20 they think, oh, he's going to tell us to redig these trenches because that's what we'd be doing
00:42:57.20 --> 00:43:00.48 if we were on exercise. Hey, you need to move this over here. That could be a little bit better.
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:07.76 It doesn't do any of that. The CO looked grim as he approached the six of us taking a tea break.
00:43:09.12 --> 00:43:16.40 Listen in lads said the RSM. That's the regimental sergeant major. We looked at him wondering what was
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:23.12 coming. During the March, two parrots. So that's their sister battalion. Two parrots attacked
00:43:23.12 --> 00:43:30.32 goose green and Darwin settlements. After a long battle, the regiment liberated the settlement
00:43:30.32 --> 00:43:36.24 with the loss of 18 lives, including their commanding officer Colonel H Jones.
00:43:37.92 --> 00:43:43.84 Many have been wounded and a casualty list is being drawn up. They captured hundreds of
00:43:43.84 --> 00:43:50.56 arches. The war is now a different concept for the enemy are believed to have shot down members of
00:43:50.56 --> 00:43:57.04 two parrots showing a white flag. More information will be given once known.
00:43:59.04 --> 00:44:03.92 The CO have smiled and proceeded to the next line of partly dubbed trenches.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.40 Skitty, Kev, John and I looked at each other with open mouths.
00:44:11.84 --> 00:44:16.56 The fought of 18 members of two parrots dead outweighed the victory for us.
00:44:16.56 --> 00:44:24.56 I for one couldn't have given a shit about goose green or anywhere else on the island at that time.
00:44:26.32 --> 00:44:30.32 It was a thought of losing our mates in the sister battalion that worried me.
00:44:33.20 --> 00:44:40.000 So they think they've got it bad. But this other battalion had been an a serious gunfight
00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:47.12 and taken some pretty significant casualties including losing their leader, the leader of the battalion.
00:44:53.68 --> 00:44:57.60 Back to the book, the condition of our feet was becoming a major problem for the battalion.
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:04.08 An old complaint suffered by troops during many wars was afflicting us in modern war,
00:45:04.08 --> 00:45:11.60 trench foot. Our boots, badly and cheaply made coupled with our old fashioned socks and putties
00:45:13.52 --> 00:45:18.88 caused this condition and putties are like, let me have you ever seen those old kind of school
00:45:18.88 --> 00:45:25.84 world war one. They're like leggings or like gators. No gators are. They kind of cover your shoes.
00:45:25.84 --> 00:45:33.36 They kind of cover your boots. It was characterized by a dull, fumping ache all over the
00:45:33.36 --> 00:45:39.76 foot with blueness at the edges. Some say it's similar to frostbite, which some lads also got.
00:45:43.36 --> 00:45:51.12 Now they hold up for the night and then as he's sleeping, we get this corpal bee corpal bee.
00:45:51.12 --> 00:45:54.72 That's who we're talking about right now. That's Vince, Vince Bramley,
00:45:54.72 --> 00:45:59.44 he's the column corpal bee a bunch. Corpal bee a voice whispered into the trench.
00:45:59.44 --> 00:46:05.04 Steve and I came around together. I looked up to see four platoons officer looking down at me.
00:46:05.60 --> 00:46:11.36 Yes, sir, I replied. Vince isn't it? Yes, sir. Being asked your first name wasn't unusual
00:46:11.36 --> 00:46:16.80 between officers and men in the field. Sorry old boy, bad news for you. In my half sleep,
00:46:16.80 --> 00:46:21.20 I couldn't think of anything worse than being woken up. Or just from the boss. We're pulling
00:46:21.20 --> 00:46:27.92 out at first light and marching to a stansia. He said, a stansia, where the fuck is that I asked?
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:33.84 It was another 30 to 50 kilometers away towards Stanley. We learned. Stanley again is the capital.
00:46:34.72 --> 00:46:39.36 Steve and I looked at each other. As we sat, the bottom of our trench too numb to speak.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:46.48 I broke the silence first. This is getting fucking stupid, Steve. March here, dig there. We're dropping
00:46:46.48 --> 00:46:54.48 down like flies and now more. Do we're die marching without resting? Steve started laughing at my
00:46:54.48 --> 00:47:00.40 morning. His teeth shining in the dark. What are you so happy about? I said, just thought of
00:47:00.40 --> 00:47:07.28 more pain for the cause. Pain. Jesus, he was right. My feet would die before me. I thought,
00:47:08.32 --> 00:47:13.36 as I drifted back to sleep, I thought of my old corporal who trained me,
00:47:13.36 --> 00:47:19.60 corporal daring. We hated him for his hard methods. He used to say, pain doesn't matter. The mine
00:47:19.60 --> 00:47:27.52 does the work. He was right. So right. His voice was screaming in my ears now four years later.
00:47:27.52 --> 00:47:32.88 It was going to be mind over matter. There is wisdom in the pair's training method.
00:47:33.68 --> 00:47:39.68 Methods. I thought briefly of my parents who over the years had had a rough time with my
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:44.80 slobbish attitude. I had been in and out of all sorts of trouble before joining the army.
00:47:44.80 --> 00:47:49.60 I said to myself that if I died with a bullet in the head, at least it would be better than
00:47:49.60 --> 00:47:55.60 worrying them into an early grave with my attitude. But to drop out now and be branded a
00:47:55.60 --> 00:48:04.000 wanker would be unbearable. I owe a lot to everyone. My old NCO, my parents, and above all,
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.60 to the lads around me. A pair of team cannot work without everyone giving their best.
00:48:09.60 --> 00:48:15.20 It's the lads you fight and work for. You come second.
00:48:21.84 --> 00:48:29.84 So obviously more patrolling, more boots, boots, boots, over the Falkland Islands,
00:48:29.84 --> 00:48:36.88 another 30 kilometers up and down, crappy terrain. Back to the book. We are now within the
00:48:36.88 --> 00:48:42.88 enemies artillery range. The CO has ordered that we will dig shell scraps for protection.
00:48:43.60 --> 00:48:48.88 No movement like walking around, etc. until ordered tomorrow. So now they're within
00:48:49.52 --> 00:48:56.08 enemy artillery range, which we don't like artillery around here. Not when it's coming towards us at
00:48:56.08 --> 00:49:04.000 least. They're taking a look at each other, seeing where they're at. Steven Tom will look to my
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.20 feet wondering if I would be able to carry on. I found a bandage hidden in my webbing and
00:49:09.20 --> 00:49:15.60 cut it up to make small dressings for my blisters and toes. I thought the fresh air would do them
00:49:15.60 --> 00:49:23.36 help. Leaving my boots off that night was by leaving my boots off that night was to be my worst
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:29.68 mistake so far. After a freezing cold and sleepless night, the morning light showed me
00:49:29.68 --> 00:49:37.28 two swollen feet and the hardest frozen pair of boots imaginable. Putting those boots back on
00:49:37.28 --> 00:49:44.56 was agony. We marched for about four hours until the whole battalion and rendezvoused.
00:49:45.44 --> 00:49:52.16 By the time we reached this point, I was nearly crying in pain. My hips had bad webbing burns
00:49:52.16 --> 00:50:00.72 and my feet were too raw blobs as I slumped against a peak, a peat bank, Jimmy Morham murmured
00:50:00.72 --> 00:50:10.16 that I looked like death warmed up. I felt like it too. Within two weeks, we looked like a
00:50:10.16 --> 00:50:16.24 ragged bone army. Our faces were drawn with a loss of weight. Our uniforms matted and soaked.
00:50:16.24 --> 00:50:22.08 Our boots were damaged and we were hungry for solid food. Despite all this, Morau was very
00:50:22.08 --> 00:50:28.48 high in the reassuring knowledge that we had marched and taken most of the island without a bottle
00:50:28.48 --> 00:50:33.36 or a loss of life so far. So they're making rapid progress. And they're not really coming
00:50:33.36 --> 00:50:37.28 up against the enemy. The enemies were treating it. Every time they roll into a place, they find
00:50:37.28 --> 00:50:41.28 remnants of where the enemy was or when they have intelligence that was the enemy was there,
00:50:41.28 --> 00:50:45.20 but the enemy is just leaving. So it's just them against nature. That's where it's been for the
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:53.68 most part at this point. They keep pumping. We shuffled together and we were informed that we
00:50:53.68 --> 00:51:00.48 would be marching straight onto Mount Longden that night. The battle was about to begin. So this
00:51:00.48 --> 00:51:06.96 is a prominent piece of terrain called Mount Longden. We had no time for last letters or anything else.
00:51:07.68 --> 00:51:13.44 We packed our kit and were briefed and ready to go within two hours. The battalion formed up
00:51:13.44 --> 00:51:18.80 and marched uphill again, spilling out of the settlement towards the summit of Estancia.
00:51:19.92 --> 00:51:25.52 The route we took was atrocious. We crossed a rock field of some sort. The rocks were sharp and
00:51:25.52 --> 00:51:32.08 jagged. In four hours, we only covered three kilometers. Sweat ran down us like water. I stopped
00:51:32.08 --> 00:51:39.60 the one stage to take off my soaking long jones. We came to hold as the order turned back,
00:51:39.60 --> 00:51:46.08 turned back, hit our ears. What's the fucking matter now someone shouted? Just turn back and do as
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:51.20 your told screamed in officer. Just on the other side of the hill, out of the view of Stanley, which
00:51:51.20 --> 00:51:58.08 is the capital, allowed the lads had been ordered back. Why? Shortly after, we learned that the
00:51:58.08 --> 00:52:02.48 cabbage heads. So they called, that's the Marines and there's Marines, Rome, Marines are down
00:52:02.48 --> 00:52:10.16 there working and running some of the major operations and they call them cabbage heads. Shortly after
00:52:10.16 --> 00:52:14.32 we learned that the cabbage heads were running the show, hadn't agreed to our advance. They didn't
00:52:14.32 --> 00:52:18.88 think we should take the risk of going into battle on our own. So the Marines wanted to be there.
00:52:18.88 --> 00:52:29.20 With them, so they said, don't go to long to yet. Back to the book, as we were milling around a
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:35.76 peat fire with nine squadron, a chopper came down from one of the mountains. Some nosy lads ran
00:52:35.76 --> 00:52:40.56 towards an quickly brought back report that some Marines had been in a blue on blue contact that
00:52:40.56 --> 00:52:46.64 night. So another blue on blue, a returning patrol had stumbled upon a mortar-based team of sleep
00:52:47.68 --> 00:52:53.28 and it shot them as they lay in their sleeping bags. There were three to four dead.
00:52:53.28 --> 00:53:02.16 Whatever we felt about the Marines, we were sorry for them on that day. If you're out there
00:53:02.16 --> 00:53:07.44 and you use a gun for part of your job, whether you're in the police department, whether you're
00:53:07.44 --> 00:53:13.36 in a SWAT team, whether you're in the military, I'm telling you the blue on blue happens
00:53:14.32 --> 00:53:20.64 and you gotta do all you can to train for situations and always be aware that it can happen.
00:53:20.64 --> 00:53:27.44 People don't think it can happen. That's why it happens. Back to the book on 10 June, we had orders
00:53:27.44 --> 00:53:33.60 that something was going down soon. We stripped our weapons thoroughly, oil and oil,
00:53:33.60 --> 00:53:42.08 and greased them. The PC issued 50 rounds per gun for balancing. That's basically test firing
00:53:42.08 --> 00:53:47.20 and probably doing some kind of a timing drill on your weapon to make sure that it's good to go.
00:53:47.20 --> 00:53:53.12 Bob Gettison immediately balanced his gun by firing across the water, inlet into the sea.
00:53:53.12 --> 00:53:57.60 Tony Jones was just setting up his when the QM, that's a quarter-master guy in charge of
00:53:57.60 --> 00:54:01.84 supplies and logistics, came screaming over and ordered us not to waste ammo.
00:54:02.56 --> 00:54:07.60 We pointed out that the guns needed balancing, but his narrow mind wouldn't have it.
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:13.60 He walked away pleased by the thought of saving ammo. In fact, he caused a major
00:54:13.60 --> 00:54:20.96 fuck up with all the guns in the battle. Only two of the six worked. 50 rounds through each might
00:54:20.96 --> 00:54:25.20 have saved lives and would have at least provided better firepower for the battalion.
00:54:27.92 --> 00:54:34.08 So you gotta guy, the supply guy, hey don't, don't test fire your weapons. Don't do that right now.
00:54:34.08 --> 00:54:38.32 Save the ammunition. Now they did realize that they were an ammunition shortage. That was going to be a
00:54:38.32 --> 00:54:45.60 problem, but you're not going to have an ammunition shortage if your guns don't work. Back to the
00:54:45.60 --> 00:54:50.96 book, the PC came down and we gathered round him eagerly. He stood faintly, grinning at us.
00:54:52.08 --> 00:54:57.76 Spitted out Sir, said Johnny Cook orders in a half an hour, tonight lads, green light.
00:54:58.40 --> 00:55:04.16 See you by the model in a half an hour. So, they're in the model. He's talking about they built
00:55:04.16 --> 00:55:11.44 a little terrain model so that they could kind of draw out where everyone's going, kind of go through
00:55:11.44 --> 00:55:18.48 the plan. And this is what they're talking about now is the assault on Mount Longden, which is about
00:55:18.48 --> 00:55:28.32 to begin. Begins with getting into position and finally they are in position. The assault
00:55:28.32 --> 00:55:33.84 is getting started. Things start going sideways pretty damn quickly. Back to the book. We tend
00:55:33.84 --> 00:55:38.56 Oliver rushed over to our position. Right, listen in he said, I felt like saying I was anyway,
00:55:38.56 --> 00:55:43.44 but for the time joking was over. Be company of had to change their tactics a bit.
00:55:44.08 --> 00:55:50.48 Corporals, Bramlies and Cook's teams will follow myself and Captain Mason into A company positions.
00:55:50.48 --> 00:55:58.32 While Corporal Tomo, Rawlings and Pears will go to another task. Okay, so things are going crazy.
00:55:58.32 --> 00:56:05.28 They start to move. He starts to move with Lieutenant Oliver towards this other position. Back to
00:56:05.28 --> 00:56:10.000 the book. We'd run about 200 meters. We were all still together, but now the run had become a fast
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.68 stumbling walk. The noise of battle continued to grow. Continue to our right now as we moved around
00:56:15.68 --> 00:56:21.28 the slope. Suddenly a zipping sound whipped across my face. I didn't think anything of it as I walked
00:56:21.28 --> 00:56:27.52 and stumbled to keep up. Then three or four more zips hit the ground in front of in front and
00:56:27.52 --> 00:56:34.24 at my feet. I still carry on. I was walking behind Lieutenant Oliver. As I was walking behind Lieutenant
00:56:34.24 --> 00:56:40.16 Oliver, we saw bodies lying all over the place. I thought what the fuck are they doing lying there?
00:56:40.16 --> 00:56:47.12 Jesus Christ fucking lying there and we're struggling. I saw lad kneeling over a guy in a sleeping bag.
00:56:47.92 --> 00:56:53.44 I remember as I got to them just watching him. A low moaning was coming from the sleeping bag.
00:56:53.44 --> 00:57:00.56 I'd gone about 20 pieces when several more zips hit the ground sending a small shockwave all around me.
00:57:01.76 --> 00:57:06.40 For fuck's sake are you completely nuts or what some guy shouted? What?
00:57:06.40 --> 00:57:12.24 Ask Lieutenant Oliver. Do you know a sniper's picking at us? We stopped frozen solid in our
00:57:12.24 --> 00:57:17.36 trucks, then filled the ground. Our small column now joining the bodies lying all over the place.
00:57:17.36 --> 00:57:23.28 We'd walked into a company's form up where they had been stopped by a sniper.
00:57:24.32 --> 00:57:29.36 Lying there and hit me like a sledgehammer. The zips had been that had been missing me by inches.
00:57:30.64 --> 00:57:35.12 They were sniper fire. I lay there thinking you fucking idiot Vince.
00:57:36.24 --> 00:57:42.88 I cursed myself all the time. We lay there blaming myself for an unprofessional act. But then I'd never been
00:57:42.88 --> 00:57:48.16 shot at before. My mind had been so occupied with moving that the zipping sound seemed
00:57:48.16 --> 00:57:55.68 unconnected with the battle. So like I said first time being shot at and he didn't know what it was.
00:57:56.24 --> 00:57:58.80 I told this story on here before. The first time I got shot at,
00:57:58.80 --> 00:58:02.16 well the first time I was receiving fire was in the rum piece and I thought someone was going
00:58:02.16 --> 00:58:05.76 to cigarette out onto the road. I was like who the hell smoking in that home via enemy? But it was
00:58:05.76 --> 00:58:10.72 rounds hitting the Humvee. I was the same way. I was just like didn't it didn't occur to me.
00:58:10.72 --> 00:58:17.44 When it hit to you that their bullets are you like in shock or or do you just kind of shift into
00:58:17.44 --> 00:58:23.84 you know. Yeah, it's a game time. But it took me. It wasn't it was a pretty slow transition.
00:58:24.40 --> 00:58:30.64 You know, it took me to think through the whole process of who's smoking a cigarette.
00:58:30.64 --> 00:58:34.08 Wait, why are they throwing cigarettes? Wait, why do they have so many cigarettes?
00:58:34.08 --> 00:58:38.08 Where's the entire Humvee smoking a cigarette and putting them all out right now?
00:58:38.08 --> 00:58:42.16 And it wasn't like a massive volume of fire, but it was rounds hitting.
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:47.20 Well, yeah. Can be won. Yeah, that's the answer. Wait, so you saw it on another Humvee in
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:52.96 front of the Sparks. Yeah, I saw the Sparks on the ship. I thought. Yeah, so what's going on?
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:57.44 Why someone's throwing cigarettes? Same same thing. I will say this though.
00:58:57.44 --> 00:59:00.24 When the first time I got shot at when I wasn't in the vehicle,
00:59:01.44 --> 00:59:06.56 you I heard the rounds going over and I knew what it was because I was used to it from when we do
00:59:06.56 --> 00:59:13.12 butts, I don't know how I'll explain it. When you shoot on a range, like when you go sight in your rifle,
00:59:13.12 --> 00:59:19.60 you shoot on the range and and some of us guys, you go down and you work the targets for the other
00:59:19.60 --> 00:59:24.88 guys. So you're in basically in a bunker kind of or you behind a big berm. Yeah. And you put the
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.52 target up for your guys and then when they shoot at, you pull it back down, you mark it with these
00:59:29.52 --> 00:59:32.72 discs so that they know where their shots it so they can make adjustments and you put it back
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:38.000 up again. So when you're doing that and you do it at different distances, they shoot from different
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000 distances, they shoot from 100 yards and they shoot from 300 yards and they shoot from 500 yards and
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.08 they shoot from 800 yards. So you can just hear all these different ones and the further out they get
00:59:46.80 --> 00:59:52.24 the more you hear the actual sound of the round going over you. Right. And at certain ranges,
00:59:52.24 --> 00:59:57.76 you can hear a breaking the sound barrier and it's pretty loud. It's a crack more, but then when they
00:59:57.76 --> 01:00:03.28 get far enough away, you don't hear that anymore and it just sounds like he's talking about like a
01:00:03.28 --> 01:00:08.96 little zip, like a little, you know, but I knew it was the first time I ever got shot at,
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:13.44 I knew exactly what it was. Yeah. It's crazy. I knew what was good. Well, that's the first time I got
01:00:13.44 --> 01:00:18.56 shot at not in a humbry. Right. And then in a humbry. Which by the way, I got shot at first. That was
01:00:18.56 --> 01:00:24.48 the first time I ever got shot at. Was it in the humbry? Yeah. All right, going back to the book,
01:00:24.48 --> 01:00:30.96 the battle was raging on the hill. Artillery shells were landing there, adding to the ricochet of bullets.
01:00:31.68 --> 01:00:36.16 If you slowly raised your head, you could watch the free firework display because that's what it
01:00:36.16 --> 01:00:41.04 looked like. The odd shout could be heard and the odd scream, but it was the sound of rifle
01:00:41.04 --> 01:00:45.84 machine gun and artillery that dominated the night. So we've gone from hay we're out on patrol and we're
01:00:45.84 --> 01:00:52.24 looking now they're in full. There's a full battle going on. After about an hour, we were all getting
01:00:52.24 --> 01:00:57.76 pissed off with this fucking sniper. Something had to be done and quick. He was holding up 130
01:00:57.76 --> 01:01:03.60 months. So these guys are pinned down. They're pinned down. And the idea was finding the plan that
01:01:03.60 --> 01:01:09.12 they come up with is they're going to use a malond called a malond. It's like a short range kind of
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.28 it's like a bazooka, but it's wire guided so you can actually steer it a little bit. It's a missile,
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:21.04 a little hand-carried missile. And that's the plan is to use that to shoot from where they think this
01:01:21.04 --> 01:01:24.56 sniper is shooting from. So they get in position, they get them malond in position, and then they're
01:01:24.56 --> 01:01:27.76 going to once they shoot with them malond, they're going to shoot their machine guns and add it.
01:01:29.68 --> 01:01:35.20 Stand by shouted captain Mason. My feet were forgotten. My mind empty to many thoughts,
01:01:35.20 --> 01:01:39.12 but my eyes were completely alive staring at the area of the fin. He's talking about this
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:44.80 terrain feature that looks like a shark fin and possible target. Fire.
01:01:44.80 --> 01:01:51.28 Ginge let off the malond. The rocket rushed off the small portable frame and picked up
01:01:51.28 --> 01:01:58.48 its deadly speed. After 120 meters it was at its deadliest. We were only about 90 meters from the target.
01:01:58.48 --> 01:02:03.36 By the way, if you're sniper shooting at you from 90 meters, that is scary. He's not missing.
01:02:04.96 --> 01:02:09.84 Ginge managed to guide the wire missile to wire guide the missile on target.
01:02:09.84 --> 01:02:14.72 The explosion ripped into the night sending sparks everywhere. Bob pressed the trigger and
01:02:14.72 --> 01:02:21.20 are gunned burst to life for a few seconds. Then stopped. Stop it, screamed Bob. I tried to lift the
01:02:21.20 --> 01:02:28.56 feed the cover off the top of the GPMG, but the night sight was in the way. I ripped off the night
01:02:28.56 --> 01:02:33.60 sight from the weapon and threw it into sass's hands. It's another guy's sass. I cleared the gun
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:38.64 and reloaded. Bob was just about to fire again when a zipping sound ripped into the ground right
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:44.08 in front of our tripod. We both ducked behind the bank. The enemy's bullets whist over our heads
01:02:44.08 --> 01:02:49.76 and all around us. Ginge was laughing and shouted. They've seen you all right. Fucking brilliant
01:02:49.76 --> 01:02:56.000 isn't it? My night and the bloody guns packed up. Captain Mason shouted over from behind us.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.12 Reload. Reload. CS9 wants another one up there. So they wanted to hit again. We'll hit that sniper
01:03:03.12 --> 01:03:12.72 position to get with a me on which they do and they eventually take care of that problem and
01:03:12.72 --> 01:03:22.72 and are able to move on. Now they start coming back down from that supporting position because
01:03:22.72 --> 01:03:26.32 that's what they're doing is the most part they're assigned into supporting positions to get the
01:03:26.32 --> 01:03:31.04 high ground and support the assaultes they're happening. They come back down from that. We reach the
01:03:31.04 --> 01:03:37.68 bottom of the hill at about zero zero three zero hours. The battle had been going for some three
01:03:37.68 --> 01:03:42.80 and a half hours. We came up to the FAP. That's our first aid post and walk past the line of
01:03:42.80 --> 01:03:49.04 guys lying there moaning in half silence. The medics were busy with all the wounded. They're
01:03:49.04 --> 01:03:54.96 seem to be about 25 guys working and wounded in the group. We were sitting some 20 meters from them
01:03:54.96 --> 01:04:00.32 in the darkness and we could only just see the scene by the light of the moon. A sergeant from
01:04:00.32 --> 01:04:05.84 batalion HQ came over and told came over to us and they sent it all over and Captain Mason stood
01:04:05.84 --> 01:04:12.48 up to meet him. We have three confirmed dead at this moment. He said Murdock, Scott, and Greenwood.
01:04:13.44 --> 01:04:17.68 We know that are more but we can't get to them as yet. So Murdock, if you remember the guy that was
01:04:17.68 --> 01:04:24.16 making fun of making funny faces when they were on the boat coming in, confirmed dead. Their conversation
01:04:24.16 --> 01:04:32.24 continued around our coming task and that the RSM was coming to meet us. I sat in a trance. I
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:38.24 couldn't believe that we had lost guys. Today it seems crazy that I should think like this. Why?
01:04:38.24 --> 01:04:42.72 I can only put it down to the fact that I was still in my own little world of make believe.
01:04:42.72 --> 01:04:48.88 We would win the war without getting anyone killed. The death of those three guys hit me like a brick
01:04:48.88 --> 01:04:56.80 total shock. Murdock were simply docked. docked who I'd been chatting with on the way to our
01:04:56.80 --> 01:05:04.000 start line after we bumped into B company now dead. Scotty from the MT Platoon. That's the motor
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.56 transport Platoon. Like Greenwood recently nicknamed Fester because of his sleeping habits.
01:05:11.44 --> 01:05:17.28 My mind was blank to the conversation around me. Johnny nudged me. Vence were moving mate.
01:05:17.28 --> 01:05:24.08 This woke me to the reality of it all. I was now fully alert for Shirley that it was more to come.
01:05:26.08 --> 01:05:30.08 So now they're getting to another, like I said, their job has been doing supporting
01:05:30.48 --> 01:05:34.16 supporting arms, which is basically covering move on a big scale. That's what they're doing. You
01:05:34.16 --> 01:05:39.44 got to a group. This machine gun, Platoon, with the Milan, with the heavy machine guns,
01:05:39.44 --> 01:05:44.80 they're getting into elevated positions to cover for another element, another company, or another
01:05:44.80 --> 01:05:49.60 battalion to go in an assault target. This is classic cover move situation and they're in the
01:05:49.60 --> 01:05:54.72 cover position in most of these situations. And that's what's going on where we come back to the
01:05:54.72 --> 01:05:59.04 book. They're in another elevated firing position back to the book. Corporal B get ready.
01:06:00.24 --> 01:06:05.52 I waited for the command sergeant major to give the orders to fire. The weight was longer than I
01:06:05.52 --> 01:06:11.52 expected in my fingers stayed on the trigger frozen waiting. As I sat waiting for the command,
01:06:11.52 --> 01:06:17.20 other voices came to my ears from among the sounds of battle. The voices of the wounded.
01:06:18.48 --> 01:06:23.68 Everywhere their cries pitched in with those survivors still struggling and screaming
01:06:23.68 --> 01:06:29.92 frantically at each other to move their or move here. But the wounded were unlike anything else.
01:06:31.12 --> 01:06:35.76 Their cries could be heard above the uningered. Their shouts were desperate.
01:06:35.76 --> 01:06:41.20 My mind went blank. My eyes were wide open with fright for them.
01:06:42.56 --> 01:06:49.84 My mouth dried as I lay there. The second seemed like hours. Their anguished moaning and crying
01:06:49.84 --> 01:06:57.84 is here in my ears now as I write. No matter what eye or others did to try and ignore them,
01:06:57.84 --> 01:07:06.96 they somehow grew seemed to grow louder and louder. I burned with frustration. One victim
01:07:06.96 --> 01:07:12.32 who I later found out was bads bare it. Seems so near, groaning and shouting,
01:07:12.32 --> 01:07:16.80 help me, please don't leave me. For fuck's sake help, I can't move.
01:07:19.52 --> 01:07:24.40 Someone further along to our left called out for Christ's sake, I'm dying. Don't let them
01:07:24.40 --> 01:07:33.76 bury me here, please, please. I shouted out. Hang on, don't move, don't move. For fuck's sake,
01:07:33.76 --> 01:07:39.12 keep quiet. I started to crawl from my position. I wanted to help them.
01:07:41.12 --> 01:07:46.88 But to come and regret my arm. Leave it, corporal be. Leave it.
01:07:46.88 --> 01:07:55.76 I looked at him. Why? Because a sniper has already picked off about five or six guys that have
01:07:55.76 --> 01:08:04.72 tried to help, the top says no more. Okay? I slumped to the ground with a feeling of total helplessness.
01:08:05.84 --> 01:08:11.12 It was the worst feeling that anyone can imagine. As I tried not to think it was real,
01:08:11.12 --> 01:08:19.36 the cries continued. Oh God, I'm hitting the chest. I'm all wet. Please help.
01:08:20.88 --> 01:08:28.88 The crying went on and on. Some wounded guys had been dragged or had crawled away from the main
01:08:28.88 --> 01:08:35.20 impact area. Only to be pinned down elsewhere. My mind's seeth with anger.
01:08:35.20 --> 01:08:46.56 Corporal be, stand by the CSM screamed. The command to follow killed off all the cries and
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:52.80 moaning. The weapon broke a stream of fire at the Argentinian positions three to five rounds
01:08:52.80 --> 01:08:59.20 bursting across the summit. The steady rate of fire continued as the CSM shouted across to change
01:08:59.20 --> 01:09:05.12 direction using our tracer rounds as indicators. All six guns opened up. Our tracers were
01:09:05.12 --> 01:09:09.84 ripped across the summit to the other end of the mountain. The bullets bouncing and ricocheting in all
01:09:09.84 --> 01:09:23.92 directions. So hammering the target, hammering the enemy from where the enemy is shooting and
01:09:23.92 --> 01:09:30.72 obviously, I mean, what a wretched description of being within the sound of the voices of your wounded
01:09:30.72 --> 01:09:40.08 man who you cannot help because they're pinned down by snipers. Eventually, they
01:09:41.52 --> 01:09:44.88 this, I mean, this goes on for a long time. They're in the supporting position. They're laying
01:09:44.88 --> 01:09:50.24 down five or shooting thousands and thousands and thousands of rounds. Back to the book,
01:09:50.24 --> 01:09:56.64 the CSM shouted, stop, stop. War now, we rested our heads on the ground.
01:09:56.64 --> 01:10:06.32 The battle had now been going on for some 11 hours. How long we had laid their firing? I did not
01:10:06.32 --> 01:10:16.24 know the CSM came over well done. A company are moving through to our left now. We've covered
01:10:16.24 --> 01:10:21.92 them and given them all the help we could give. The rest is up to them. We can't fire anymore.
01:10:21.92 --> 01:10:28.88 It get to them. It's too close now. It'll be light in an hour or so. Pull the gun back and dismount it.
01:10:30.80 --> 01:10:35.92 Surred did we get any ass bob? More than enough he replied and walked away.
01:10:37.20 --> 01:10:47.20 Had we killed? We must have. I felt nothing afterwards. Just relaxed. I hadn't seen our targets.
01:10:47.20 --> 01:10:53.04 They had been hidden in darkness. We hadn't killed at the end of a bayonet or through a rifle site.
01:10:53.92 --> 01:10:59.04 We had killed with a spray of machine gun bullets. It didn't seem personal.
01:11:00.40 --> 01:11:03.52 It was as if the enemy hadn't existed at all.
01:11:03.52 --> 01:11:18.48 They complete that mission.
01:11:24.48 --> 01:11:29.44 They crawl back to a little bit of a covered position away from where they had been
01:11:29.44 --> 01:11:37.52 supporting. And then here we go back to the book about 70 meters away. The ground exploded in a
01:11:37.52 --> 01:11:43.44 massive earth, shrapnel and rock. Then another shell came over this time further to our right.
01:11:43.44 --> 01:11:49.36 I looked down the hill as the shell exploded and saw an unbelievable display of flying red sparks
01:11:49.36 --> 01:11:56.72 dead be shrapnel. The ground shook as shell after shell fell behind us. The first minutes of
01:11:56.72 --> 01:12:04.72 shelling were terrifying. So they've been, this is it. Now they started. We mentioned that they
01:12:04.72 --> 01:12:11.12 were in artillery range and we all know what an absolute horror show artillery is.
01:12:13.04 --> 01:12:18.08 Back to the book and the distance a booming sound began. That carried over the area. Someone's
01:12:18.08 --> 01:12:24.96 screen incoming. Sure enough the air disappeared. There was a wash and the explosion killed any
01:12:24.96 --> 01:12:31.52 remaining piece. The shells came in thick and fast. I lay watching the red glowing shrapnel flying by.
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:37.52 Now the shrapnel was creeping up towards me. The explosions getting so loud I thought they would
01:12:37.52 --> 01:12:43.68 defen me. The shells were landing about 50 meters away. Four or five shells would hit an area in a
01:12:43.68 --> 01:12:50.88 salvo. Then the next batch would hit about 10 meters nearer. The booming from Stanley could still be
01:12:50.88 --> 01:12:56.24 heard in the gaps between explosions in our areas. As I lay there watching the shrapnel getting
01:12:56.24 --> 01:13:03.60 closer I found myself shaking. Was it from cold or fright? My legs shook and I couldn't control
01:13:03.60 --> 01:13:10.08 them at all. The next salvo landed 30 meters away. I curled up into a ball as the shrapnel
01:13:10.08 --> 01:13:17.36 splintered the rocks around me. A piece of shrapnel landed in my little alcove still burning with
01:13:17.36 --> 01:13:25.20 fury sizzling into the dirt by my waist. Four or five more shells landed around us and then it stopped
01:13:26.08 --> 01:13:33.04 as if it had never begun. The air was misty as though a fog had swept over us. I lay back praying
01:13:33.04 --> 01:13:40.000 it was over. In the half light of the false dawn I could now hear shouting all down the hill.
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.28 Some guys were screaming like mad. One voice went right through me. The scream of a man who knows
01:13:45.28 --> 01:13:55.36 he's about to die. All over the hill people were shouting medic medic. I was about to crawl
01:13:55.36 --> 01:14:02.08 from my hole when another shell hit the ground. I hadn't even heard it coming. I fell on my face and
01:14:02.08 --> 01:14:08.72 stayed there for a few seconds. Another shell landed nearby. This time a shower of dirt fell on my back.
01:14:08.72 --> 01:14:16.48 I crawled back into my hole and crawled up again, waiting. My body shook uncontrollably.
01:14:17.76 --> 01:14:23.44 The shells landed in thick salvo's, the noise and explosions around me, making my head spin as if
01:14:23.44 --> 01:14:31.04 someone were banging in against a wall. I wielded the to stop, but the shells carried on. I'm landing
01:14:31.04 --> 01:14:38.24 around me. Then this second bar bombardment within minutes ended as suddenly as it had begun.
01:14:42.64 --> 01:14:52.96 So horrible, horrible situation that they're in. And much like we talked about the Germans having
01:14:54.32 --> 01:14:58.000 their mortars dialed in and they're artillery dialed in. It's the same thing. You're in the
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:03.36 Falkland Islands. There's obvious terrain features. So when you're holding a city like the
01:15:03.36 --> 01:15:09.04 the Argentinians military is in the city of Stanley, well they know where they're going to get
01:15:09.04 --> 01:15:12.80 attacked from and they know what are good firing positions. So they have those positions dialed
01:15:12.80 --> 01:15:20.24 into their artillery and they can just start hammering them. Back to the book, I can remember the O.C.
01:15:20.24 --> 01:15:24.72 shouting behind me. Move, move. There artillery will be here soon again. So now they're trying to move.
01:15:24.72 --> 01:15:30.16 Sergeant P waited only for me to squeeze myself through the gap before he took off again.
01:15:30.72 --> 01:15:36.64 After we had gone about four or five steps, a hand dropped out of the rocks grabbing at my ankle
01:15:36.64 --> 01:15:43.04 and denoms. The shock of it made us jump instantly. Sergeant P was back with me.
01:15:44.16 --> 01:15:48.32 We both looked at my feet. Still holding my denoms was a wounded argy.
01:15:48.32 --> 01:15:56.96 His eyes were staring at me pleading perhaps full of sorrow. Sergeant P shouted step back
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:02.40 Brammer's. I tried to step back but the wounded soldier tightened his grip on me. I leaned
01:16:02.40 --> 01:16:07.60 back as Sergeant P pointed his weapon and fired two bullets into the man's head. The noise of his
01:16:07.60 --> 01:16:14.72 weapon echoing around the small gap. Tomo and Johnny were behind me now. The argy's head bounced
01:16:14.72 --> 01:16:19.92 quickly as the two rounds entered him. His eyes rolled to the back of his head and his mouth opened
01:16:19.92 --> 01:16:24.88 to the release of trickle of blood and saliva which ran down his chin onto his shirt collar.
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:31.28 At the same time his hand gave up its grasp on my denoms and dropped onto my boot.
01:16:32.64 --> 01:16:39.12 I flicked my boot as if I was playing football. His hand and arm dropped across his body and from
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:45.44 his mouth came a low whistle of air mixed with blood. All this took seconds but it seemed like a
01:16:45.44 --> 01:16:52.56 lifetime to me. Each date detail remains with me today. The sight of this guy dying at my feet
01:16:52.56 --> 01:16:58.96 shocked me but I was growing harder. Although shaken I felt no remorse at the time.
01:16:59.76 --> 01:17:04.08 The deadly game of war lay at my feet. Only I mattered.
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:12.32 The rights of wrongs, the rights and wrongs of war can never be argued from the armed chair.
01:17:13.52 --> 01:17:17.28 Decisions are made on the spot questions asked afterwards.
01:17:18.64 --> 01:17:23.52 That lone argy could have been rigged to a booby trap or even armed.
01:17:24.72 --> 01:17:30.80 The kill was done quickly and professionally. I felt that I should have acted as quickly as
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:38.72 Sergeant P. Come on move he shouted. Sergeant P screamed in order for me to follow him.
01:17:38.72 --> 01:17:43.28 As we trotted further into the clearing we had to jump over the twisted pile of corpses.
01:17:45.36 --> 01:17:52.96 My mind was never nor has since been so alert. A adrenaline was rushing through my body so
01:17:52.96 --> 01:17:58.72 quickly that I felt I was floating with excitement mingled with fear. A little further into the
01:17:58.72 --> 01:18:06.08 clearing lay three or four Argentinians visibly shaken. Shaking visibly close together on the ground.
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:12.40 We ran half walked through a deadly sickening area of death. They looked up as we arrived.
01:18:13.12 --> 01:18:16.32 All had been seriously wounded and were moaning and crying.
01:18:18.08 --> 01:18:21.60 One held up his hands across his eyes and shouted mama.
01:18:21.60 --> 01:18:31.76 I felt he thought that we were or I was about to shoot him. He was known calling for his mama
01:18:31.76 --> 01:18:39.28 in a low whale. One Argentinian sat in a trance. His eyes wide and staring at nothing.
01:18:40.80 --> 01:18:46.80 Tears ran down his face the only sign that he was alive. None of them moved.
01:18:46.80 --> 01:18:56.32 All looked like they expected to be shot by us but we ran past. The whole area was littered with weapons,
01:18:56.32 --> 01:19:05.76 helmets, clothing and food and ammo. A few bullets whizzed overhead and smashed into the rocks.
01:19:05.76 --> 01:19:10.56 A corpus shouted that tumble down. This is another prominent terrain feature.
01:19:10.56 --> 01:19:17.20 Tumble down was firing at us. We ran into a tight gap in the gpath and all came to an abrupt
01:19:17.20 --> 01:19:23.76 halt as it was a dead end. Four or five bodies lay sprawled their close together.
01:19:25.12 --> 01:19:31.36 This time they were our own men. The camouflage pair of smocks hit my eyes immediately.
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.20 CSM Wix was standing over them like a guardian, screaming at some of his men to cover the further
01:19:39.20 --> 01:19:46.56 end of the path in the small crest. The CSM and Sergeant P exchanged quick words. I wasn't listening.
01:19:47.68 --> 01:19:53.84 My mind was totally occupied with looking into the crags for the enemy. I turned to look at
01:19:53.84 --> 01:19:58.72 our own lads dead on the ground, mode down when they tried to rush through this gap.
01:20:00.56 --> 01:20:08.32 I felt both anger and sadness. The CSM's face showed the strain of having seen most of his company
01:20:08.32 --> 01:20:15.52 either wounded or shot dead. That night's fighting was written in every line of his face.
01:20:17.84 --> 01:20:23.04 We all doubled back into the clearing we had just run through. We spread out and waited for our next move.
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:31.68 A wounded Argentinian lay right next to me 10 meters away. He'd been hitting the chest and
01:20:31.68 --> 01:20:38.88 screamed as he held the wound. A lad from B company ran across the clearing atom and ran his
01:20:38.88 --> 01:20:47.04 bayonet through him. The screaming Argentinian tried to grab the bayonet from him before it took his life.
01:20:49.04 --> 01:20:57.52 Our lad screamed shut up, shut up you cunt. The enemy soldier died as the bayonet was withdrawn.
01:20:57.52 --> 01:21:03.92 The lad walked back to his seat among the rocks as if nothing had happened.
01:21:07.68 --> 01:21:11.92 To my right, three Argentinians were crying with their heads in their hands.
01:21:13.20 --> 01:21:18.56 Were they the dead men's friends? At their feet lay one of our lads,
01:21:18.56 --> 01:21:24.16 moaning in pain as a medic attended to him. I could see his back was peppered with trappinol.
01:21:24.16 --> 01:21:33.20 I swung to my left and fell against some rocks. I now felt the shock of it all coursing through my body.
01:21:34.80 --> 01:21:38.16 I wailed softly, my throat feeling like I wanted to choke.
01:21:40.16 --> 01:21:44.40 My eyes watered and I shook my head to force myself into reality.
01:21:47.52 --> 01:21:48.88 But this was reality.
01:21:48.88 --> 01:21:58.32 I looked for Bob and Johnny. I couldn't see Bob, but Johnny was there staring right at me.
01:22:00.56 --> 01:22:04.08 Our eyes met telling each other that we felt the ended come.
01:22:07.76 --> 01:22:11.04 A lad resting with his rifle pointed towards tumble down,
01:22:11.04 --> 01:22:18.80 turned, fell into a tight ball, curling himself up as he hit the ground, screaming, incoming, incoming.
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:23.44 We all dropped to the ground, crawling behind rocks wherever we could.
01:22:24.64 --> 01:22:27.44 The first shell went over us onto the west side of the mountain.
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:35.12 Then the shell started to creep up towards us, and one bump into the clearing, hitting a rock
01:22:35.12 --> 01:22:40.88 about 30 meters away. The ground shook as if we'd been hit by an earthquake,
01:22:40.88 --> 01:22:44.80 shrapnel prite pierced the ground or bounced off of rocks all around us.
01:22:46.40 --> 01:22:49.44 Grant, grinned him, screamed out, the shrapnel had hit his leg.
01:22:50.64 --> 01:22:55.92 Two of his mates were pulling him into better cover as the shells rained down us around us again.
01:22:58.16 --> 01:23:04.88 Soon after, corpus Stuart McLaughlin was hit in the back
01:23:04.88 --> 01:23:11.60 by shrapnel. He was later killed by a direct mortar hit as he was being taken to a first aid post.
01:23:13.92 --> 01:23:19.68 I laid their trembling as shells roared over us, each explosion shook more fear into us.
01:23:26.80 --> 01:23:32.24 We had centered our group about halfway along the mountain.
01:23:32.24 --> 01:23:38.16 The O.C. shouted us to split up a bit, otherwise a direct hit would cause a heavy loss.
01:23:38.96 --> 01:23:43.12 Through your four anti-tank lads got up and ran to a bunker on the other side of the hill,
01:23:43.76 --> 01:23:49.60 as another salvo came rushing in on us. A shell crashed into the rock above the O.C.
01:23:49.60 --> 01:23:52.48 sending shrapnel and rock in the opposite direction to us.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:58.08 He looked up at all of us, as we looked at him expecting him to be dead.
01:23:58.08 --> 01:24:03.12 Since the shell had only landed a few meters from us all, he shouted across.
01:24:03.12 --> 01:24:04.96 Well, that was an oddie. One wasn't it.
01:24:06.88 --> 01:24:11.28 We laughed unanimous in appreciation of his complete calm.
01:24:14.24 --> 01:24:16.24 The shells came in for over an hour.
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:21.84 We just laid their hoping, praying that it would end soon.
01:24:21.84 --> 01:24:29.84 I lay looking straight into Johnny's face who at times would poke out his tongue or do his grin again.
01:24:32.32 --> 01:24:36.80 The shell and stopped as usual as suddenly as it had began.
01:24:38.16 --> 01:24:40.96 I stood up and saw Cav Connery crouched by a rock.
01:24:42.32 --> 01:24:45.20 Cav I screamed. He looked over and smiled.
01:24:45.20 --> 01:24:46.88 Get your arms over here, you twop!
01:24:46.88 --> 01:24:52.88 He had started to walk towards us when two or three more shells hit home.
01:24:53.92 --> 01:24:59.84 We all flopped the ground once more. The vibration of the explosions shook us on and the earth landed
01:24:59.84 --> 01:25:06.88 on our backs. We jumped up to see Cav running towards us. He jumped into our little opening.
01:25:06.88 --> 01:25:10.16 Jesus, fuck me, he said, I've had a right night of it too.
01:25:11.76 --> 01:25:14.000 Where's Johnny Crow and Skitty? Mate, I asked.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.24 Cav looked into my face and said, Johnny's dead.
01:25:20.16 --> 01:25:25.60 He's dead, Vince killed outright. Skitty's been wounded. Only me left.
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:28.32 Oh, for fuck's sake, how?
01:25:30.08 --> 01:25:34.40 In the attack, a burst around's head, Johnny Square in the chest. I reckon he was dead before
01:25:34.40 --> 01:25:40.08 he hit the ground. Cav explained. We carried on chatting about the situation in general.
01:25:40.08 --> 01:25:46.32 Rick Westy was brewing up for us when we heard the booming sound again from Stanley.
01:25:47.52 --> 01:25:50.88 Incoming someone screamed, not again Johnny shouted.
01:25:52.40 --> 01:25:56.80 We were getting more scared with each bombardment. We hit the ground and fought to get legs,
01:25:56.80 --> 01:26:00.08 arms, and bodies more comfy and secure than each others.
01:26:01.36 --> 01:26:06.08 At this rate they'll get us. We can't have luck on our side forever, you know, I shouted,
01:26:06.08 --> 01:26:12.80 as the shells exploded around us. I lay next to Cav, we both faced the mess tin, where a couple
01:26:12.80 --> 01:26:18.56 was brewing. A shell landed not three meters away, sending shrapnel and dirt in our direction.
01:26:19.52 --> 01:26:24.88 Rocks and earth fell around us, then over us, as if we were about to be buried alive.
01:26:26.48 --> 01:26:31.84 Both Kevin and I automatically reached out to cover the mess tin and the water that was coming to a
01:26:31.84 --> 01:26:40.000 boil. The dirt landed on our hands and the brew was saved. Everyone burst out laughing.
01:26:41.44 --> 01:26:45.52 Talk about a time of crisis to all let's have a cup of tea Johnny shouted.
01:26:53.44 --> 01:27:00.48 Brutal. The, you know, great account and I know we've been done gone through a lot of
01:27:00.48 --> 01:27:07.52 accounts of being sheldered with artillery. That's a very descriptive and granular one.
01:27:09.12 --> 01:27:16.72 And it's not over. Back to the book, Kevin, I walked up and over the hill.
01:27:17.68 --> 01:27:24.16 Ricky followed us armed with a smock order with every pocket filled with mags for SLRs. We came to
01:27:24.16 --> 01:27:30.72 a clearing. Ricky was busy looking to one side of us when suddenly Kevin I heard moaning. We stepped
01:27:30.72 --> 01:27:37.12 up on a ledge and came face to face with a wounded argy. Sitting beside him was his friend who
01:27:37.12 --> 01:27:44.72 obviously wouldn't leave him. The wounded soldier had been shot in both knees and in his chest and arms.
01:27:45.92 --> 01:27:53.68 Blood showed on all the wounds his face showed no pain merely pleading. His mates stood up and put his hands
01:27:53.68 --> 01:28:01.92 up. No one had seen these two until now. I pointed my rifle and bay in that and nodded towards
01:28:01.92 --> 01:28:08.08 the wounded guy. He started wailing and moaning and put both hands together as if praying to me.
01:28:09.52 --> 01:28:15.44 Kevin pulled a pistol from his belt. Well, Vince, we either shoot them or help them.
01:28:16.24 --> 01:28:22.96 What will it be? Kevin lowered his pistol and looked at me. I raised my rifle and framed the wounded
01:28:22.96 --> 01:28:29.84 argy's head right in the sight. The man looked down as if he was expecting death knowing that he could
01:28:29.84 --> 01:28:38.08 do nothing about it. He wailed louder. I lowered my rifle.
01:28:40.32 --> 01:28:46.96 Kevin, he looks like my neighbor. I'll help them, okay? Yeah, okay. I'm off the find some goodies.
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:53.68 He walked off. I motioned to his mate to sit on the other side of the wounded guy while I
01:28:53.68 --> 01:28:59.76 placed my weapon to one side of me and went down to help. The wounded argy's mate shook his head,
01:28:59.76 --> 01:29:07.76 looking at my rifle. Me, friend, me, friend, you, friend. You helped my friend. We all friends now.
01:29:07.76 --> 01:29:15.84 He pleaded. I looked at him and gave him a small grin. He grinned back. I didn't trust him one bit.
01:29:17.68 --> 01:29:24.32 The wounded guy started to cry. It was then that I felt sad. Sad that I had fought of killing
01:29:24.32 --> 01:29:31.12 them and that we were all in this mess together. We had different views and different homes,
01:29:31.12 --> 01:29:39.76 but there we were all together. I still hated the enemy, but just then when that guy started to cry,
01:29:39.76 --> 01:29:46.24 I felt different. We all had to be hard, hard to the facts of what was happening to all of us.
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:49.92 Killer be killed.
01:29:49.92 --> 01:30:00.24 I made my way back to where our team was stationed. I got there as Rick was sitting down.
01:30:00.96 --> 01:30:06.32 The O.C. was busy with orders. Vince, we're out of water. Got me. Johnny asked. No,
01:30:06.32 --> 01:30:12.80 I replied. Just then Captain Mason shouted. And Avv you've seen Peter Headaker around.
01:30:12.80 --> 01:30:20.88 I saw him last night with Gith with Jin, with Jin and West Sir. I shouted. Perhaps West
01:30:20.88 --> 01:30:29.12 you'll know. Captain Mason looked at me with serious eyes. All the support team who were sitting there
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:36.08 looked at Captain Mason and me. I felt something was wrong. The O.C. motioned me over.
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:46.08 I got to him and crouch down. Corporal B. Jin's McCarthy was killed and so was Philip West.
01:30:47.28 --> 01:30:54.72 The shell was meant for your gun team. A flashback of what had happened filled my mind.
01:30:54.72 --> 01:30:58.000 The smock pulled from my back, the spinning head, the deafness.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:09.28 It must have missed you by inches. Corporal B. U.K. Yeah. I'm okay. I'll go find Headaker then.
01:31:10.48 --> 01:31:14.08 Captain Mason came over. Sir, he said to the O.C.
01:31:15.20 --> 01:31:20.000 Pete Headaker was killed also. The bearers have now found his body.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:33.28 I stood up and walked back to my spot. I was gutted beyond belief. Pete had always been my mate.
01:31:35.20 --> 01:31:41.36 We spent many times together drinking in the shop. I met his family too.
01:31:41.36 --> 01:31:49.44 Now he was dead. Only a short while ago I'd been sitting beside him.
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:59.28 He'd said what a good spot he had. Now he was dead. Killed by a shell that was meant for me.
01:31:59.28 --> 01:32:07.12 I'll never forget that I survived while he was killed.
01:32:07.12 --> 01:32:31.68 So they do some movement. They actually get back up into their positions to where they were.
01:32:31.68 --> 01:32:37.84 Actually, the word, where gingit been when he had been killed. Going back to the book, we turned around to where
01:32:37.84 --> 01:32:44.08 gingit lane and walked back from the skyline to find a gap through which to find the gap through which
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:50.80 sergeant P. had led us. In this way, we avoided being seen from tumble down.
01:32:50.80 --> 01:33:00.64 On the ground, I saw bits of clothing and flesh everywhere resembled a slaughter yard.
01:33:03.52 --> 01:33:06.88 We walked down 10 meters or so and there was more and more.
01:33:08.72 --> 01:33:12.16 Stuck on the side of Iraq was clearly a large piece.
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:19.76 Johnny and I moved closer to it and my stomach turned as I saw the nose and cheek of a face.
01:33:22.80 --> 01:33:30.96 We looked at each other, our eyes wide. I put my bandet under the flesh and flicked it to the ground before
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:43.12 bearing it quickly. Neither of us spoke. I had no doubts and P. N. confirmed to me that this was the
01:33:43.12 --> 01:33:51.12 remains of a mate. P. told me later that he had died instantly, from only the waste down remained.
01:33:51.12 --> 01:34:01.20 I felt good at beyond belief. I had been told of the direct hit that it also killed two others
01:34:04.16 --> 01:34:08.88 to see it with my own eyes. The body and remains was another story.
01:34:08.88 --> 01:34:21.52 Over walking over the crest, we bumped into Pat Harley. With him were one or two others,
01:34:21.52 --> 01:34:27.60 although I no longer remember who they were. As I was talking to Pat, I noticed a helmet on the
01:34:27.60 --> 01:34:35.68 end of an SLR planted in the rock face. Notting towards this, Pat mentioned that he had come up
01:34:35.68 --> 01:34:42.96 and found Jordi Lang dead. We rounded the rock face and at our feet laid dock and Jordi,
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:52.64 both on their backs. They had died in an open space with the infamous tumble down looking down on them.
01:34:54.72 --> 01:35:01.92 Jordi had died trying to save dock. The bastard sniper had caught him in the open as he reached him.
01:35:01.92 --> 01:35:11.20 Jordi lay with his mouth slightly open. Gunshot wounds to his chest and stomach meant he died quickly.
01:35:13.60 --> 01:35:17.52 Evidence around him showed that he had tried to reach dock. He had been
01:35:18.32 --> 01:35:25.92 had he been calling for him, help himself. Pat looking cut up took Jordi's
01:35:25.92 --> 01:35:33.12 bags, saying he'd want us to have these rather than the re-election on. Returned our attention to
01:35:33.12 --> 01:35:41.52 dock who was more depressing. docked head and died quickly. Quickly. He must in fact
01:35:41.52 --> 01:35:49.04 have been fully aware of his injuries. The top part of his skull was blown away the brain visible
01:35:49.04 --> 01:35:56.32 smashed by a sniper's bullet. Only the fragmented skull had prevented the complete collapse
01:35:56.32 --> 01:36:03.44 of the side of his head. How he survived the impact God knows, laying beside him were items from
01:36:03.44 --> 01:36:09.92 the first aid kit he'd been carrying. Field dressing half open, safety pins in his right hand fingers
01:36:09.92 --> 01:36:18.32 near the ground. His left hand held a morphine syringe. This had been used the thin needle point
01:36:18.32 --> 01:36:25.84 towards him. It must have been his dying act. His radio mic was still attached to his throat.
01:36:27.36 --> 01:36:34.000 Her close friend told me many months later, dock fell on his radio, the sending switch was stuck
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.32 and he was on permanent send to all of us. We could hear him gurgling and moaning as he became
01:36:42.32 --> 01:36:51.20 aware that he had been shot badly. Vince and sent the signalers nuts, but we were all helpless.
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:58.16 The sniper picked it anyone that moved. Jordey tried and lost his life for it.
01:36:59.68 --> 01:37:04.56 We eventually had to turn on to the emergency frequency to establish communications again.
01:37:04.56 --> 01:37:12.80 Doc had remained conscious and eventually died on a part of that mountain, alone with a lad
01:37:13.68 --> 01:37:15.44 who would bravely try to rescue him.
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:35.04 So, just to explain that on your... Yeah, what's called a push to talk button on your radio
01:37:35.04 --> 01:37:47.04 and however he fell, he landed on that push to talk so that he was broadcasting his death
01:37:47.04 --> 01:37:52.16 and his dying was broadcast over the network for everyone to hear.
01:37:52.16 --> 01:38:10.56 These guys, they still have to fight and they start gathering against some intelligence.
01:38:10.56 --> 01:38:16.16 They think there's a counter attack coming in. By the way, this intense fighting is a matter of gaze.
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:19.36 So, everything that we're talking about is happening in a couple days.
01:38:19.36 --> 01:38:23.60 And now they think that there is a counter attack coming.
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:30.24 So, they dig in, they get in position, they set their machine guns up from where they think the counter
01:38:30.24 --> 01:38:37.52 attack from the Argentinians is going to come from. And then they start getting mortar again.
01:38:38.24 --> 01:38:41.84 Hit with artillery, here we go back to the book. We all hit the ground again as the shell landed.
01:38:42.56 --> 01:38:47.12 No sooner had I started to pick myself up. When a high-pitched scream rushed into my ears,
01:38:47.12 --> 01:38:54.24 a deadly sound, I can still hear it today. I looked down to where the shell had hit in the same
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:58.32 areas before. The ground was smoldering, smoke lifting and evaporating.
01:39:00.40 --> 01:39:08.48 Five meters away from the hole, lay two bodies. The sight of one of them will stay with me until I die.
01:39:08.48 --> 01:39:15.76 His parasmoc was riddled with smoke escaping from every corner. The arms, bottom and collar.
01:39:17.68 --> 01:39:22.32 The lad turned on to his back screaming, oh God, help me, help me, please.
01:39:24.48 --> 01:39:31.04 I ran down the hill in fright and concerned. I dropped to my knees by the screaming soldier. His eyes met mine.
01:39:31.04 --> 01:39:39.76 Did he register me? I only saw Denzel. Denzel, the character we all loved.
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:48.72 I wrenched my eyes to his legs. One was hanging off ripped to shreds. The bone clearly visible.
01:39:49.60 --> 01:39:54.40 His screaming churned by stomach. It was like nothing I'd ever heard. He tried to look down at his
01:39:54.40 --> 01:40:00.72 leg. Don't fucking look this way. I barked, lay back down, hear me. He dropped to his back holding his
01:40:00.72 --> 01:40:08.16 spot. Five. Jonah Jones, a nine squadron lad came to my side. Vince, I'll deal with him. You see
01:40:08.16 --> 01:40:13.60 the him. He said pointing to Craig Jones. Craig lay very close to Denzel.
01:40:15.68 --> 01:40:20.88 Clive rushed to help me. Craig hadn't any visible wounds. He lay quietly as
01:40:20.88 --> 01:40:27.28 Clive tried to talk to him. I tried to pull a smock open and pull his trousers down to check
01:40:27.28 --> 01:40:33.20 for a wound. Denzel screamed and moan behind me. Help me. Jonah was busy seeing to his leg.
01:40:35.04 --> 01:40:39.92 I pulled out my knife and started to cut through Craig's denoms and quilted art at clothing.
01:40:40.64 --> 01:40:44.96 My friend at cutting was too slow and I knew it. The doctor skitted him beside me.
01:40:44.96 --> 01:40:47.84 Pulled out his scissors and started to cut through Craig's leggings.
01:40:50.24 --> 01:40:53.68 I pulled the ripped material to one side. We had reached the skin.
01:40:53.68 --> 01:40:59.52 His legs had massive laceration and all directions spilling muscle and bone,
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.80 but there wasn't hardly any blood. The doctor shouted at me to tie his muscles together.
01:41:06.80 --> 01:41:11.68 I pulled out my field dressings and tied the laceration together. The doctor was joined by a
01:41:11.68 --> 01:41:18.24 medic who went to Denzel. I was half conscious of cries of medic. Metic stretcher bearer all
01:41:18.24 --> 01:41:25.92 down the hill. Craig was lying still. I slid up beside him and looked into his face.
01:41:25.92 --> 01:41:29.76 It was pale with no color at all. His eyes stared into my face.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.80 You'll be okay Craig. Just hang on mate. Hang on.
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:40.08 Clive held his head. Stroking his forehead repeating my words,
01:41:40.08 --> 01:41:45.84 Craig, can you hear me? I shouted. The doctor pulled in tubed frantically at Craig's clothing
01:41:45.84 --> 01:41:51.68 trying to reach more obvious wounds. Craig, you'll be okay. Hang on.
01:41:53.60 --> 01:42:00.96 You looked at me and his slight smile came across his face. His eyes laughed at me.
01:42:02.16 --> 01:42:11.36 Bright and wild. His grin spread. Then all expression faded.
01:42:11.36 --> 01:42:34.40 And he faded away. Craig, Craig, don't keep in there. His eyes closed. He died then and there.
01:42:34.40 --> 01:42:44.80 He was a young soldier 20 years of age. The records will say,
01:42:44.80 --> 01:42:55.20 private Craig Jones. The doctor motioned a bearer to get him on and away.
01:42:55.20 --> 01:43:03.92 Dencil was also lifted and carried away. I fell onto my bottom.
01:43:06.16 --> 01:43:10.48 Jones and Clive padded me on the shoulder. I tried to get up but felt to my knees again.
01:43:13.12 --> 01:43:17.12 I hadn't realized until then that I was crying crying without knowing it.
01:43:17.12 --> 01:43:26.000 I cried with all the pain and sadness. It didn't seem fair.
01:43:30.32 --> 01:43:35.60 Johnny came to my side and picked me up. He picked up my weapon and started to guide me to our bunker again.
01:43:37.36 --> 01:43:41.44 I glanced at Steve and Sass. Sass was crying as well and Steve had his
01:43:41.44 --> 01:43:55.12 head buried in his hands. I stumbled to our bunker weeping. When I sat down Steve
01:43:55.12 --> 01:43:59.44 wake put around his arm around me and whispered, you'd done a brave thing Vince.
01:44:00.96 --> 01:44:04.32 I couldn't have gone down there after those shells landed in the same spot.
01:44:04.32 --> 01:44:16.40 You done all right mate. His gesture didn't register. I cried with exhaustion, hatred, and pity.
01:44:19.52 --> 01:44:25.84 Craig and Dencil remain with me today. Craig who died and Dencil lost a leg and so nearly as life.
01:44:25.84 --> 01:44:35.28 When people write or tell of experiences of this kind, I know now that they can never
01:44:35.28 --> 01:44:42.08 really tell the facts for anyone to totally understand. For often the reader is wrapped in his own
01:44:42.08 --> 01:44:50.16 make-believe game of war. For me personally this five-minute experience changed my whole life
01:44:50.16 --> 01:44:59.76 and attitude towards war. War's will always be fought and I would go again for my beliefs,
01:44:59.76 --> 01:45:07.52 but I hope never again to see a face fade from me. It took me nearly a year.
01:45:08.96 --> 01:45:17.04 After this war for Craig's face to go before I slept. Newly a year to wipe out Dencil's
01:45:17.04 --> 01:45:26.64 smock on fire and his scream. Until I die it will remain a part of me.
01:45:26.64 --> 01:45:53.44 And because it is war there is no time to mourn and soon after that they are marching for their final
01:45:53.44 --> 01:46:00.72 assault on Stanley, which is the capital city. Going back to the book after we had tabbed about
01:46:00.72 --> 01:46:09.12 1000 meters with wireless ridge clearly visible above us. The absence of troops and the silence of
01:46:09.12 --> 01:46:13.60 guns in Stanley began to produce some puzzle looks along the line of support company.
01:46:15.44 --> 01:46:21.60 Our O.C. shouted for a halt. We collapsed on the frosty ground to wait for orders. I looked
01:46:21.60 --> 01:46:26.72 up at the sky thinking what now? Who's fucked up this time? Let's just get this part started.
01:46:29.36 --> 01:46:33.44 A few shouts came down the line. I lent forward and saw that the line was breaking up in the
01:46:33.44 --> 01:46:41.76 men laughing. Sergeant McMathus was sitting behind me. Besides me. What's going on? Make I asked
01:46:41.76 --> 01:46:50.40 fucknose events. The shouting continued as messages passed down towards us. A guy three or four
01:46:50.40 --> 01:46:56.16 positions down from us suddenly turned round and shouted the wankers have surrendered. A white flag
01:46:56.16 --> 01:47:05.28 is flying over Stanley. Put your braze on index index. The last part of the message had an ironic
01:47:05.28 --> 01:47:12.32 ring because for some of the task force the whole thing had seemed like an exercise. So index is a
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:17.84 term. We say it all the time and training. When you want to stop the exercise you say index
01:47:17.84 --> 01:47:22.56 it's short for index or size. So that's one of those things where it seemed like for some of the
01:47:22.56 --> 01:47:28.72 guys they were just on this big exercise. And so they literally said hey it's index and to the exercise
01:47:28.72 --> 01:47:35.28 right now. Make and I looked each other. Bollocks I said we stood up to see the remains of free
01:47:35.28 --> 01:47:43.52 pair of coming off longden in their red braze. Joy washed through my body. Make and I hugged each
01:47:43.52 --> 01:47:51.44 other. Nothing more was said. The message had reached everyone. I slipped off my helmet and put
01:47:51.44 --> 01:47:59.12 on my beret which had stayed close to hand throughout. As I stood looking down at moody brook
01:47:59.12 --> 01:48:08.000 the red braze stuck out like sore thumbs against the grass. I felt proud. The beret on my head
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:18.08 meant more than any task the army had ever thrown at me. It meant victory. The feeling is
01:48:18.96 --> 01:48:33.44 indescribable. Now that's that and they spend obviously it's over but it's not like you just
01:48:33.44 --> 01:48:40.48 get to step and it's instantly over. They spend time there. They go through some pretty significant
01:48:40.48 --> 01:48:48.16 looting and he talks about that a bunch and he kind of comes to he goes kind of berserk and looting
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:53.76 and they're all just gathering up war trophies and whatever they can find to value and they go into
01:48:53.76 --> 01:49:01.44 this one sort of a bunker position to loot and they on one side of the bunker it's all a bunch of
01:49:01.44 --> 01:49:07.60 weapons and the other side is other kind of more personal type items and they have so many weapons
01:49:07.60 --> 01:49:11.12 if they don't need anymore so they go and they start taking stuff from the other side.
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:19.52 Mem a little like I said personal items I think it was and they walk out of there and then the next
01:49:19.52 --> 01:49:26.24 day they find out that the side with the weapons on it was all booby trapped with 70 pounds of explosive
01:49:26.24 --> 01:49:29.92 so they went in there if they would have picked up like two or three things off of that it was
01:49:29.92 --> 01:49:34.48 a pressure plate a pressure release so if they were picked up two or three things they would have
01:49:34.48 --> 01:49:38.80 gotten killed his him and his crew would have gotten killed and that's when he realized you know when
01:49:38.80 --> 01:49:45.20 he talks about he's like I was so greedy I wasn't even thinking anymore they go through that they eventually
01:49:45.20 --> 01:49:52.72 they get done they ship away and eventually end up two and I wonder then from from a different
01:49:52.72 --> 01:49:59.20 island they fly back to back to England and here we're going back to the book we stepped off the plane
01:49:59.20 --> 01:50:07.60 at RAF Brise Norton the next morning we were hit by the English summer in full blaze as we entered
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:12.80 the airport lounge the doors were slung open to screaming crowd of relatives who charged towards us
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.48 my mother climbed over chairs to hug me with all the rest of my family and close pursuit
01:50:18.48 --> 01:50:26.64 my wife came up to me I was tense and made unsure by all the noise and shouting it made me
01:50:26.64 --> 01:50:35.20 scared in a peculiar way Karen looked hard and almost angry hello Vince was all I got from her
01:50:36.88 --> 01:50:43.68 so he's home obviously his wife was a little bit tense about some things back to the book
01:50:43.68 --> 01:50:48.24 he actually before he go back to the book he they they do a little quick greeting with their
01:50:48.24 --> 01:50:54.16 family but then they get back on a bus with the rest of the the people the Italian members
01:50:55.12 --> 01:51:00.000 and they start driving back to their compound back to the book always very quiet on the journey
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:06.24 the English countryside made me feel like an alien Johnny tapped my shoulder from behind
01:51:06.24 --> 01:51:12.88 Vince the trees man look at them I looked at the trees they were part of what was making me feel
01:51:12.88 --> 01:51:19.68 like an alien they were all in full bloom bright green leaves in the wind there was traffic on the
01:51:19.68 --> 01:51:26.80 roads shops people walking about doing their own thing it all seemed unreal after only three months
01:51:26.80 --> 01:51:36.40 away it was a shock to see civilization again the odd thing was I felt anger anger and everyone
01:51:36.40 --> 01:51:41.84 for doing their own thing it was as if something in my head was urging me to shout at them as they
01:51:41.84 --> 01:51:47.28 walked along the streets hey you looking your fucking ice creams there's a fucking lot of injured
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:54.80 guys over there friends have been killed but all you're interested in is yourselves
01:51:58.32 --> 01:52:05.36 just frustration I know the general public was concerned but it just didn't seem like it then
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:11.76 I wasn't expecting a metal or even a pad on the back I really didn't know what to expect
01:52:11.76 --> 01:52:19.04 even so I found it hard to become there was no way I could relax if I had been asked to go
01:52:19.04 --> 01:52:25.60 do a torn Ireland I would have gone more than anything I felt the pinch of no longer having my
01:52:25.60 --> 01:52:32.24 friends around me we had been together so tightly over the last few months that it was as if
01:52:32.80 --> 01:52:40.96 now I had had a set an arm severed the buddy buddy system that we had needed to literally survive
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:45.60 wasn't there anymore and the sheltered life now seemed too far
01:52:46.48 --> 01:52:54.08 but now seemed to me far too boring to endure I made a point of not talking about my experiences
01:52:54.08 --> 01:52:59.04 to any member of my family including my wife but I do remember sitting up in bed one evening
01:52:59.04 --> 01:53:07.52 turning my wife and giving her a very mild insight into what had really happened I was sick
01:53:07.52 --> 01:53:12.08 to death of the presses views and of the publicity of a country still high on war
01:53:14.80 --> 01:53:21.76 I told Karen what had happened to Denzel and Jones the blank look she gave me
01:53:22.32 --> 01:53:27.12 with a half smile told me she wasn't interested and couldn't understand me at all
01:53:29.36 --> 01:53:37.20 I never said anything again I tried to look at it from her point of view instead she was sick of
01:53:37.20 --> 01:53:45.68 the war of the army and of me going away whenever I bumped into one of the lads I see more at home
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:51.28 and relax talking our private language with him then I did with civis and my own family
01:53:54.72 --> 01:53:58.56 if I had had my own way I would have gone out on the biggest bend or ever
01:53:58.56 --> 01:54:05.76 but I knew that was the easy way out
01:54:10.64 --> 01:54:16.96 these remind me of one soldier's war you know you come back and there's no doubt
01:54:18.16 --> 01:54:22.72 when you come back from war you're gonna feel some of this I'm gonna tell you right now
01:54:22.72 --> 01:54:25.76 you're gonna feel some of this when you see civilians walking around
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:32.96 looking their ice cream cones it's gonna it's gonna it's good it's a it's a rough transition
01:54:32.96 --> 01:54:40.08 you know back to the book there's no doubt that I was slowly unwinding over the long leave
01:54:40.72 --> 01:54:44.16 but the board I'm also gave me more time to think about my experiences
01:54:45.92 --> 01:54:48.08 worst of all were my nightmares about the war
01:54:48.08 --> 01:54:54.80 at first they came nightly later they faded and returned intermittently
01:54:56.40 --> 01:55:02.64 I always had the same dream of Denzel's smock and Jones's face passing before me
01:55:04.08 --> 01:55:08.40 I would wake up in a bed so wet that a bucket of water might have been thrown over me
01:55:11.52 --> 01:55:16.88 the nightmares lasted about six months or so today I can see and understand everything that has
01:55:16.88 --> 01:55:24.64 happened to me I know now that I wasn't alone the most comforting words I ever had to help me
01:55:24.64 --> 01:55:30.56 did not come from any of my family my family were concerned but could never really understand
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:36.80 what I was going through those words came from my friends in the pub as we drank during leave
01:55:38.80 --> 01:55:44.32 Johnny turned to me and said vents I've had a few turns in the night you know
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:51.92 that made me sit up and see clearly that I wasn't alone and when you're not alone
01:55:53.52 --> 01:55:54.32 you're stronger
01:56:00.80 --> 01:56:05.92 so that's something that I hear from a lot of vets
01:56:05.92 --> 01:56:13.92 and maybe you're thinking that this is something you're experiencing that no one else is
01:56:14.64 --> 01:56:20.64 not true not only are other guys going through it other guys have always gone through it
01:56:23.04 --> 01:56:27.84 you're not alone back to the book I fully believe that we as a nation performed the most
01:56:27.84 --> 01:56:33.76 excellent of tasks I'm fully behind the decision to send the task force and I wouldn't
01:56:33.76 --> 01:56:41.20 hesitate to fight again for a country and its beliefs people who win jibbout the decisions taken
01:56:41.20 --> 01:56:51.68 in war they weren't involved in to me are the most misguided of all the most striking events
01:56:52.72 --> 01:56:56.40 to affect me throughout the war were obviously the deaths of my friends
01:56:56.40 --> 01:57:02.32 eight years ago I regarded those friends as those in two and three pairs only
01:57:04.08 --> 01:57:09.60 now after learning about others experiences and after watching and reading others accounts
01:57:09.60 --> 01:57:17.52 I see that the whole task force was my friend I watched a marine sergeant in a TV documentary
01:57:17.52 --> 01:57:28.56 his eyes showing the emotion of his story and the site told me we were all the same
01:57:31.76 --> 01:57:38.48 I still feel a bit angry that the wounded went unnoticed a propaganda film on the task force
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:42.88 as a rival home showed only the pairs in the Marines in the navy homecoming
01:57:42.88 --> 01:57:50.48 can you remember seeing the badly wounded coming through the gates I think not
01:57:52.80 --> 01:58:01.92 nobody wants to see the effects of carnage never again will I think that war is just a game
01:58:04.16 --> 01:58:09.12 like they showed on TV it is very different from how it is portrayed in books and films
01:58:09.12 --> 01:58:18.80 we call ourselves into the killing game don't we I remember very clearly watching from a window
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:24.80 of my quarters five or six kids playing a war game some were even dressed in combat gear
01:58:24.80 --> 01:58:31.44 and carrying small toy machine guns I watched with interest in their tactics and attacking
01:58:31.44 --> 01:58:38.72 a cardboard box that was meant to be an enemy held position the two kids defending rolled over
01:58:38.72 --> 01:58:46.40 and pretended to die went over run by the goodies after being tegged by their friends they got
01:58:46.40 --> 01:58:56.32 up to resume the game from me high we start to practice what is in human nature to defend and kill
01:58:59.12 --> 01:59:06.000 the one big difference between their game and the real one is that you don't get up after really
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.72 being shot who are as the legal killing of people and can be very scary
01:59:15.76 --> 01:59:25.20 who are as killed or be killed we also must remember that a lot of the command structure
01:59:25.20 --> 01:59:29.76 at junior rank level can almost be too difficult to maintain in the heat of battle
01:59:29.76 --> 01:59:37.84 then what becomes a winning factor is the determination of the private soldier
01:59:39.68 --> 01:59:49.20 his loan get up and go and do attitude we must take our hats off to the junior ranks of all
01:59:49.20 --> 01:59:54.72 services for they are the backbone of the war machine in that they have to kill a close range
01:59:54.72 --> 02:00:02.16 we are lucky to have what is perhaps one of the best fighting forces in the world
02:00:02.16 --> 02:00:05.28 thanks to our system of training and to our discipline
02:00:09.20 --> 02:00:15.68 even today I feel frustration about the war I was so psyched up to carry on with the fight
02:00:15.68 --> 02:00:20.24 into Stanley that the Argentinian surrender may be disappointed as well as happy
02:00:20.24 --> 02:00:29.12 I try very hard to keep out of fist fights now as I wouldn't like to lose myself control
02:00:31.68 --> 02:00:39.60 do my alone in feeling this or their hundreds or thousands of other time bombs out there
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:46.80 other experience veterans may be sympathetic to all of said
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:53.76 we can only wait for the next war now to practice the art of killing again
02:00:55.76 --> 02:00:56.88 I hope I'm there to help
02:00:59.84 --> 02:01:07.28 finally I must quote a first world war veteran who told me so many years before I joined the army
02:01:07.28 --> 02:01:18.40 you'll like the army events but not war it's horrible boy he was right
02:01:20.40 --> 02:01:27.76 I didn't like it then again I did
02:01:27.76 --> 02:01:48.40 I'm going to close this book out with the beginning of this book and it reads
02:01:48.40 --> 02:02:00.24 this book is dedicated to the soldiers of three parah whose comradeship and determination
02:02:00.24 --> 02:02:03.84 throughout the campaign make the author proud to have served with them
02:02:08.16 --> 02:02:14.40 so that the members of three parah who never returned are not forgotten their names and ages
02:02:14.40 --> 02:02:17.44 at death in action are listed below
02:02:20.80 --> 02:02:26.72 private Richard Absalon military metal 19 years old
02:02:29.12 --> 02:02:36.16 private Gerald Bull 18 private Jason Burke 17
02:02:36.16 --> 02:02:46.24 private John Crow 21 private mark Doddsworth 24
02:02:48.72 --> 02:02:51.76 private Anthony Greenwood 22
02:02:54.64 --> 02:02:57.68 private Neil Gross 18
02:03:00.64 --> 02:03:01.92 private Peter headaker
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:10.56 22 Lance Corpore Peter Higgs 23
02:03:13.68 --> 02:03:16.24 Corpore Stephen hoped 27
02:03:19.68 --> 02:03:22.32 private Timothy Jenkins 19
02:03:25.28 --> 02:03:26.96 private Craig Jones 20
02:03:26.96 --> 02:03:33.20 private Stewart Lang 20
02:03:36.24 --> 02:03:39.12 Lance Corpore Christopher Love it 24
02:03:42.32 --> 02:03:45.52 Corpore Keith McCarthy 27
02:03:45.52 --> 02:03:53.44 Sergeant Ian McCay Victoria Cross 29
02:03:57.44 --> 02:04:01.52 Corpore Stewart McCoffland 27
02:04:01.52 --> 02:04:12.32 Lance Corpore James Murdock 25
02:04:12.32 --> 02:04:12.56 Lance Corpore David Scott 24
02:04:15.60 --> 02:04:19.12 private Ian Skriven's 17
02:04:19.12 --> 02:04:28.40 Corpore Alex Shaw 25
02:04:29.44 --> 02:04:35.04 private Philip West 19
02:04:35.04 --> 02:04:48.40 and
02:04:53.04 --> 02:04:54.72 you notice those names
02:04:58.16 --> 02:05:01.12 those men their ages
02:05:01.12 --> 02:05:08.24 and their ranks they're all their all junior ranks
02:05:08.80 --> 02:05:12.000 the one sergeant sergeant Ian McCay
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.08 who was awarded the Victoria Cross for storming 50 caliber machine gun
02:05:20.08 --> 02:05:30.80 mission but the rest of those men are privates and Lance Corpore's and Corpore's
02:05:32.88 --> 02:05:37.36 young men and
02:05:39.84 --> 02:05:41.28 as Kipling pointed out
02:05:41.28 --> 02:05:48.000 they're no plaster saints by any stretch
02:05:51.84 --> 02:05:52.48 but damn
02:05:52.48 --> 02:06:05.92 they might not be saints
02:06:12.32 --> 02:06:14.80 but I've no men like these
02:06:14.80 --> 02:06:21.92 and I've seen them with my eyes
02:06:27.20 --> 02:06:29.28 and as I have said
02:06:32.72 --> 02:06:37.84 and as this tale of the Falquins confirms once again
02:06:37.84 --> 02:06:46.72 war is hell and it's a hell that can bring out the worst in men
02:06:49.12 --> 02:06:50.80 but it can also bring out the best
02:06:58.80 --> 02:07:00.32 and don't forget these young men
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:06.88 who like so many others
02:07:10.40 --> 02:07:11.20 answered the call
02:07:14.96 --> 02:07:22.16 fought and died in that awful place to protect their brothers
02:07:22.16 --> 02:07:36.88 and for the more and if you read this book you will realize that we all have a little bit more to give
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:46.56 mentally and physically you can go further you can push harder
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:53.92 you can be more ruthless if you have to be and you can also show more mercy
02:07:59.92 --> 02:08:00.88 you can be better
02:08:03.60 --> 02:08:12.64 I can be better we can all be better and we most often get better not from the easy things and not from the good times
02:08:12.64 --> 02:08:22.80 but from the hard times then the challenges and the suffering in life that pushes you to your breaking point
02:08:26.08 --> 02:08:31.92 and demands that you give absolutely everything you have
02:08:31.92 --> 02:08:39.52 but you have to keep going
02:08:44.96 --> 02:08:49.20 so no matter what
02:08:53.12 --> 02:08:53.84 keep going
02:08:53.84 --> 02:09:07.68 and I think that's all that I've got for tonight
02:09:07.68 --> 02:09:16.72 to be
02:09:19.76 --> 02:09:26.80 crazy hell how it got that crazy that vicious in like that short period of time
02:09:28.16 --> 02:09:34.24 it is and we we had to remember that that's what we have one perspective
02:09:34.24 --> 02:09:42.32 from one squad for in one platoon and there was you know the story of two pair
02:09:42.96 --> 02:09:44.48 the one where the battalion commander
02:09:45.76 --> 02:09:52.40 eight Jones won the victorier cross by the way what about that what about that story
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.92 and not to mention the royal marines that were down there as well what about their stories
02:09:57.92 --> 02:10:06.56 yeah and that's the thing that just it's I still can't wrap my head around the amount of
02:10:07.92 --> 02:10:12.000 untold stories that there are and not just the not just the fact of the stories
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:21.52 but to think that these because this is this battle is a very short time compared to Vietnam or
02:10:22.32 --> 02:10:27.12 World War Two or World War One or even the wars that we've been fighting today that have been going on
02:10:27.12 --> 02:10:34.56 for years and years and years but it's not so much at the story that that like we're missing the story
02:10:34.56 --> 02:10:47.68 but these people existed everywhere and they exist everywhere and and yeah it's it's
02:10:47.68 --> 02:10:55.04 it's an incredible the take a look at the book by the book and read it and it's I actually
02:10:57.28 --> 02:11:01.68 I got into some of the graphics stuff some of the some of the interaction to them when they're not
02:11:01.68 --> 02:11:08.24 in combat is actually it's real crude and I didn't you know I didn't cover much of it not that
02:11:08.24 --> 02:11:12.32 you know I wanted to get to more of the combat constraints that's kind of I didn't realize that I
02:11:12.32 --> 02:11:18.000 didn't cover as much as sort of just the straight-up crude behavior that they that they I mean they're on the
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.84 both for a while they're drinking they're getting drunk when they're coming home it's there's some
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:30.96 some crude behavior and and things that are taking place and that's kind of why I jumped on the
02:11:30.96 --> 02:11:38.48 opportunity to read Tommy by gippling because that's totally true then you know what they say in
02:11:38.48 --> 02:11:47.60 kind of our way of saying that in the seal teams we would say this we that guy is a in case
02:11:47.60 --> 02:11:52.40 of war break glass kind of guy oh yeah meaning we don't want him around all the time we want to keep
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:57.04 him over here on the side in the glass but yeah if something happens yeah break glass and we'll get
02:11:57.04 --> 02:12:05.52 this this frog man out now what's what's jacked up about that is that's that played more
02:12:05.52 --> 02:12:11.84 of a role when I was first in the seal teams and the more the the older I got the moment sure I got
02:12:11.84 --> 02:12:18.08 the more I realized like that's that's okay but it doesn't really work what you need is to have someone
02:12:18.08 --> 02:12:24.16 that you can have out of the glass and that learns and what you have to do is a leader is you take
02:12:24.16 --> 02:12:30.40 those guys that instead of putting those guys in the glass jar or behind a in a glass box somewhere
02:12:30.40 --> 02:12:36.16 and keeping their in case war what you do is you do what you do with a freaking wild dog you have to
02:12:36.16 --> 02:12:40.88 train them you have to bring them out you have to socialize them amongst the humans so that they
02:12:40.88 --> 02:12:46.80 can so that they can interact because a guy that you have to keep in you know in behind a glass
02:12:46.80 --> 02:12:53.12 barrier from the rest of the world the chances of you needing him for that type of situation are
02:12:53.12 --> 02:12:58.64 pretty minimal so what about all the other situations that he'd be beneficial for so what you have
02:12:58.64 --> 02:13:04.32 to do is a leader is teach those guys that have the attitude of you know I'm just I'm just a
02:13:04.32 --> 02:13:10.24 nothing but a straight warrior don't care about anything else I'm here to go to war otherwise leave
02:13:10.24 --> 02:13:14.40 me alone what you want to do is you want to get those guys out into the world socialize them like a good
02:13:15.20 --> 02:13:19.04 attack dog that that's not going to bite anything in front of it's going to actually bite what you
02:13:19.04 --> 02:13:25.20 want it to bite and then you have something that's a much more valuable not only for you as a
02:13:25.20 --> 02:13:30.40 leader but for them because they have a much better opportunity so there's still a few guys left in the
02:13:30.40 --> 02:13:35.84 old mold of in case of war break glass but most of the guys now are are actually
02:13:36.72 --> 02:13:42.72 more versatile than that and I'll tell you when I was young I was probably falling at a category
02:13:42.72 --> 02:13:51.52 I wasn't exactly the guy you wanted to throw out in front of the admiral to look at right and say
02:13:51.52 --> 02:13:57.12 this is our model guy right here it's you know wouldn't have been that way now at the old
02:13:57.12 --> 02:14:03.20 I got them or I recognized how important having that both sides of the of the coin covered
02:14:03.20 --> 02:14:08.16 and you couldn't just be of freaking rampaging berserk or all the time you had to actually
02:14:08.72 --> 02:14:16.24 be a professional yeah to be a professional and so I definitely had my share of time spent in that zone
02:14:16.24 --> 02:14:25.84 back in the day but what's good is I think guys knew that about me and that therefore when I
02:14:25.84 --> 02:14:31.04 came up to and said hey man look we gotta we gotta do better than that or hey we we can't be acting like
02:14:31.04 --> 02:14:38.88 that they knew that I wasn't coming to them from a from a what's that we're from the ivory tower
02:14:38.88 --> 02:14:44.08 I wasn't looking down on them like all I can't believe you're not that way we don't act out
02:14:44.08 --> 02:14:50.08 way we're naval representatives I wasn't coming to like that I was coming to and hey we're professionals
02:14:50.08 --> 02:14:55.12 we gotta get we want to get hired to do jobs we want to kill bad guys we got to get missions
02:14:55.12 --> 02:15:01.92 we got to get mission approval those were the things that that you know I kind of passed on to
02:15:01.92 --> 02:15:08.80 to my guys was hey that's cool be a frog man but be a disciplined frog man yeah be a frog man
02:15:08.80 --> 02:15:14.80 that can represent and I think that's another thing in the book when there's no war going on how
02:15:14.80 --> 02:15:19.76 we're that you know they're they're the kind of maniacs you know yeah and and then when the war breaks
02:15:19.76 --> 02:15:27.44 out they go even more maniacs style and it's almost like they get into that mode of like who cares
02:15:27.44 --> 02:15:32.56 anyways we're gonna die we're gonna die we just you know who cares but after you go to war
02:15:32.56 --> 02:15:36.80 for an extended period of time you're like actually you're not gonna die actually
02:15:36.80 --> 02:15:43.52 there's a decent chance you're gonna live and there's a decent chance that you need to
02:15:43.52 --> 02:15:49.36 continue to build you know the the reputation of the seal teams not just as
02:15:50.40 --> 02:15:55.68 where killers but where professionals yeah so and we should have a reputation of both
02:15:55.68 --> 02:16:04.88 and we do by the way thanks ill professional killers is right but yeah it's a great book there's
02:16:04.88 --> 02:16:09.68 a lot to learn from it there's a lot to learn again I that that the way that they're going
02:16:09.68 --> 02:16:13.36 from peacetime and again I know that they were doing tours in Ireland at the time and that was
02:16:13.36 --> 02:16:19.68 no joke and they took casualties in Ireland and there was many soldiers killed in northern Ireland
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:26.56 but that wasn't comparable to what they went through in the focklands so it was interesting to see
02:16:26.56 --> 02:16:33.76 how they handled approaching combat for the first time yeah another part that I think these books
02:16:33.76 --> 02:16:39.44 really bring to light is just the physical conditions that that they go into even talking
02:16:39.44 --> 02:16:42.16 talking to you guys when you guys talk about how hot it is then everyone's gonna all you
02:16:42.16 --> 02:16:47.60 add a detail like oh yeah so I'm like you know all my clothes are all wet from my sweat
02:16:47.60 --> 02:16:51.76 and usually that's not part of the movie when you watch the movie you know or like these guys
02:16:51.76 --> 02:16:57.04 is for just feet are falling off you know because it's cold and I was sitting in a combat outpost
02:16:57.84 --> 02:17:03.60 in Ramadi and it was nighttime right the coolest part of the day and I wasn't doing anything and
02:17:03.60 --> 02:17:08.16 I hadn't been doing anything and I was literally sitting in a combat outpost you know the
02:17:08.16 --> 02:17:12.96 boys were out in an Overwatch position and I was back there I had been quarantined but I did it it
02:17:12.96 --> 02:17:17.36 wasn't that it wasn't that established of a combat outpost yet so I still had all my gear on
02:17:17.36 --> 02:17:21.28 but I was just sitting there I've been sitting there for let's call it two three four hours
02:17:22.80 --> 02:17:28.64 and I was sitting there and I just kind of put my I was sitting down and I angled my back to like a
02:17:28.64 --> 02:17:33.84 45 degree angle and I was kind of looking at the ground kind of resting a little bit and as I looked down I was
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:41.60 full athletic sweat dripping off me like that fast and I wasn't doing anything yeah that's just
02:17:41.60 --> 02:17:45.44 that's the bait that's where you start yeah that's where you start not to mention guys legs
02:17:45.44 --> 02:17:53.04 getting blown off all this stuff all these yeah man yeah that's crazy yeah it's um the physical
02:17:53.04 --> 02:17:58.16 and the other big thing is the physical conditioning that you need to be prepared for
02:17:59.36 --> 02:18:04.16 is is pumping with a rock sack on yeah that's a big deal that you know that you know they don't
02:18:04.16 --> 02:18:09.44 show a lot of that no and any kind of military training they don't just show it they don't show
02:18:09.44 --> 02:18:15.76 it enough they should they should I mean we just did another trip up to Yosemite and we got our boots boots
02:18:15.76 --> 02:18:23.68 boots on and it's it's if you're not conditioned for that it's gonna be hard and you can make it
02:18:23.68 --> 02:18:28.72 through a day yeah maybe you can make it through two days but also you're not carrying I was telling
02:18:28.72 --> 02:18:36.48 my my kids up there up in the mountains you're not carrying any weight compared to what you carry
02:18:36.48 --> 02:18:41.92 with when you have gear when you have the when you go tactical you don't have the you probably
02:18:41.92 --> 02:18:47.12 have 30 pounds maybe if you're just if you're just camping or whatever you've got a couple you
02:18:47.12 --> 02:18:52.80 got a couple leaders of water you've got a sleeping bag in a ground pad you've got some trail mix
02:18:53.44 --> 02:19:00.08 maybe a little bit more food but you're talking 30 40 pounds tops yeah you get geared up
02:19:01.44 --> 02:19:05.84 bro I would weigh guys would before we'd send them out on training operations I'd weigh
02:19:05.84 --> 02:19:12.80 them training operations they're there rocks away like 110 pounds you're gear alone you're your
02:19:12.80 --> 02:19:23.36 body armor helmet ammo magazines you know magazines an ammo grenades you're your 60 70 pounds
02:19:23.36 --> 02:19:29.12 then you put water that you're talking I think I think I weighed like 310 or something with like
02:19:29.12 --> 02:19:37.12 you're on seriously like roll well cop yeah roll the cop still heavy on on roll I think it was part
02:19:37.12 --> 02:19:42.56 two where he shocks himself because he wants to get rid of the messed up director see like given
02:19:42.56 --> 02:19:47.36 he falls down right he's unconscious and then they're like hey we gotta help him they try to pick
02:19:47.36 --> 02:19:54.64 him up oh he's too heavy to move yeah that actually happened to uh we were on a training exercise
02:19:54.64 --> 02:20:00.96 and tea bruiser and I got put down they said a jockel your dead so I made down and I just
02:20:00.96 --> 02:20:07.20 laid there and life came over to throw me in the back of the home v i was like a robot cop down there
02:20:07.20 --> 02:20:11.60 so life got a couple buddies who said hey guys help him move jockel still not moving dead weight
02:20:11.60 --> 02:20:16.64 job and they're like okay yep you know you were like making extra effort to be dead weight
02:20:16.64 --> 02:20:20.64 oh yeah for sure like you're like I'm not fully participating you know training exercise
02:20:20.64 --> 02:20:27.92 I wanted those guys to be prepared to put a grenade in my mouth and be there so you get some
02:20:30.80 --> 02:20:37.44 awesome well speaking of lots of stories maybe you could tell some stories about
02:20:38.24 --> 02:20:46.40 how to support this I'd be happy to know no short story hey did you get into drinking
02:20:46.40 --> 02:20:52.88 pomegranate white tea and subsequently jockel white tea because your wife is a Brit no he's into tea
02:20:52.88 --> 02:20:57.44 she turned you on the tea and she didn't really because they drink tea with milk and I don't
02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.48 yeah but you know hey you can get a credit but she doesn't get credit for that one she drinks tea yeah
02:21:04.48 --> 02:21:09.36 she did drink her put the kettle she says she says a couple tea couple tea like here or anything she says
02:21:09.36 --> 02:21:15.04 well couple tea what's the reason real but doesn't cure everything is the same thing like that I don't know
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:20.24 who that was yeah I think it's like Chris Ross I don't remember specifically where I got the first
02:21:20.24 --> 02:21:25.92 cup of jockel white tea from but I do remember that it was in the desert when I was I was at the training
02:21:25.92 --> 02:21:32.56 command and I was would be giving the debriefs or sitting through the guys briefs and we'd be
02:21:32.56 --> 02:21:39.04 going on like 234 hours to sleep so you need a little bit of kick yeah somebody has somewhere I
02:21:39.04 --> 02:21:45.60 got some jockel some tea yeah it wasn't yet jockel white tea just pomegranate white tea yeah and
02:21:46.48 --> 02:21:51.12 yeah that's where I'm for and I drank it I was like this nice yeah this is nice the cold one
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:55.76 yeah wait was it cold yeah yeah yeah or definitely had it cold because you're at the desert
02:21:55.76 --> 02:21:59.68 you don't want to drink hot tea unless you're British yeah yeah kind of productive they be drinking
02:21:59.68 --> 02:22:04.96 hot tea no matter what they don't even drink lasty I don't really like hot tea that much
02:22:04.96 --> 02:22:09.60 yeah that whole island they don't really like iced tea like you can't go to restaurant all
02:22:09.60 --> 02:22:13.76 so iced tea they look at you like you're weird yeah yeah which I've been looked at many times there
02:22:13.76 --> 02:22:19.36 yeah for me weird this face it you you're kind of weird bro that's all right anyway
02:22:20.88 --> 02:22:26.72 you got if we want to support ourselves first off I'm gonna talk about my little stories not sure
02:22:26.72 --> 02:22:31.20 sorry Longland no please kidding remember I told you I got to take a little bit of press I got the
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:36.24 on it kettlebells right so if the first ones I got get all the the design of ones they're cooler
02:22:36.24 --> 02:22:43.12 might be yeah I don't think I've ever yeah I used the regular ones before at other gyms
02:22:43.12 --> 02:22:47.12 but anyway I get the the cool ones the ones that someone takes a picture of me and I have
02:22:47.12 --> 02:22:52.64 on my look like extra cool with the primal you can see how different our thought patterns are yeah
02:22:52.64 --> 02:22:58.72 you're here to win I get it and I can dig it fully but I got the chimplons those are
02:22:58.72 --> 02:23:08.80 what one pood okay whatever the 16-ing killer went up to the werewolf just the other day I ordered
02:23:08.80 --> 02:23:16.32 the gorilla what's that one 70 something I got a pair I incorporate that in I'm getting strong
02:23:16.32 --> 02:23:20.72 man I'm getting good at the kettlebells you're gonna need them 88's like I got yeah wait what is the one
02:23:20.72 --> 02:23:26.48 that that it's big foot right I don't know what that is but my the biggest kettlebells that I currently
02:23:26.48 --> 02:23:34.32 have yeah our 40 kilograms yeah it's like yeah 88 pounds what's 90 something because 2.2 pounds per
02:23:35.36 --> 02:23:42.08 kilogram okay so it's like we can do the math if you want but nonetheless that's heavy oh I don't
02:23:42.08 --> 02:23:48.08 know I'm I don't know if I'm ready for that and given my current exercise program with them
02:23:48.64 --> 02:23:54.72 I do we should start doing math exercise yeah maybe more break it's calculated or whichever
02:23:54.72 --> 02:24:00.16 either way that's the one I got and so so look yeah I'm gonna recommend it if you're into kettlebells you
02:24:00.16 --> 02:24:06.80 want to you know get your kettlebells on get on it once they're cooler that's my opinion good
02:24:06.80 --> 02:24:12.64 a lot of cool stuff I got a jump rope and stuff like that too um you know what I'll say did
02:24:14.16 --> 02:24:19.36 hundred burpees in 10 minutes oh brand like where you at yeah yeah yeah see remember last time
02:24:19.36 --> 02:24:26.56 you did it yeah I didn't brand it just so you know echo is now he notoriously bad cardio
02:24:26.56 --> 02:24:32.08 not like that I mean you you you you credit I'm giving you credit but still we could use that
02:24:32.08 --> 02:24:37.12 as sort of a statement to say if echo could do it come on brand and yeah actually I think the
02:24:37.12 --> 02:24:43.12 statement is look off our echo has come look how far I think that's the statement will make
02:24:43.12 --> 02:24:47.60 I just made it there you go far echo has come said he can do a hundred burr a lot of people thinking
02:24:47.60 --> 02:24:52.16 how on a burpees in 10 minutes is a joke actually yeah I could I could dig it I mean I've been doing
02:24:52.16 --> 02:24:57.20 burpees for for a while not that kind you know not to kind my they're just in my routine
02:24:57.20 --> 02:25:00.88 oh yeah many but I'm familiar with them so I'm like okay you can you know how you can kind of
02:25:00.88 --> 02:25:05.20 gauge like okay I do this many so what it would a hundred take out of me you know can I do it
02:25:05.20 --> 02:25:14.64 243 2010 yeah so how I did it was 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest 25 one minute rest
02:25:14.64 --> 02:25:21.12 15 and then like two minute minute and a half maybe I don't know something like that give
02:25:21.12 --> 02:25:30.72 or take and then a 10 and actually sorry 11 I did 101 burpees and it was nine minutes flat
02:25:30.72 --> 02:25:36.96 that's good yeah branded what you got here's what I found here's I don't know if my cardio is good
02:25:36.96 --> 02:25:41.52 or bad is better than it has been it's better than all time just in general even due to
02:25:41.52 --> 02:25:46.96 and other stuff what's the stuff all so you know I'm you know when you run and I don't know
02:25:46.96 --> 02:25:53.04 you know get not just yeah whatever hey life man something life those physical challenges at you
02:25:53.04 --> 02:26:01.52 either way so yeah I did 101 in nine minutes flat what it was was I wasn't breathing as hard as
02:26:01.52 --> 02:26:06.88 maybe you might think like that wasn't the the issue wasn't the breathing was like just
02:26:06.88 --> 02:26:12.000 boom push up but I'm pushing it jump and the acting acid okay yeah yeah yeah but would you feel legs
02:26:13.52 --> 02:26:20.16 weird yeah legs fully shoulders not chest like I think you know do it a push up one every you
02:26:20.16 --> 02:26:26.40 know second isn't that much for me but strangely my shoulders and this part that like what you call
02:26:26.40 --> 02:26:31.92 these the serrats they're like sore next day you know weird way it was weird man none the last
02:26:31.92 --> 02:26:37.60 yeah I did prove that burgers are good exercise yes fully got you some funky work out there yeah
02:26:37.60 --> 02:26:42.000 this is it's good and then so I go in youtube I see this one guy does 100 in a row oh my
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.16 dang because 25 was I didn't know I was gonna be like hey I'm gonna do as many as I can how long
02:26:48.16 --> 02:26:54.88 it's taking me 100 in a row oh three minutes and 33 seconds if I'm not mistaken that's credit yeah
02:26:54.88 --> 02:26:59.04 you know what here's the thing though here's the thing I think it's the thing I don't know
02:26:59.04 --> 02:27:03.20 it's thing or not that's why I'm asking a question okay so what really is a burpee I mean as far
02:27:03.20 --> 02:27:08.08 as like okay so when I first started doing burpees I want to do burpee is you your chest touched
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:12.72 the ground and jump in there okay so what about my hands do they have to go about my head or can
02:27:12.72 --> 02:27:17.68 they be yes technically it's a little clap over the head oh a clap so what I mean over the head like
02:27:17.68 --> 02:27:21.76 technically has to be above the head so if I go like this or doesn't have to be well this you guys
02:27:21.76 --> 02:27:25.84 do this I do a little bit of everything and depending on how tired I am okay if you see when I'm
02:27:25.84 --> 02:27:30.72 really tired my clap was barely happening and it's happened and like six inches in front of my belly
02:27:30.72 --> 02:27:37.84 yeah okay so here like but if you want to be like technical yeah I mean a really technical
02:27:37.84 --> 02:27:42.72 perfect burpee would be like both hands clapping up above your head as your six inches in the air
02:27:42.72 --> 02:27:46.72 yeah you can't do too many though you can't do as many those though no bear to tell you
02:27:46.72 --> 02:27:51.20 not at all that's kind of the difference between the dynamic jump like a high jump
02:27:51.20 --> 02:27:57.28 and not a dynamic jump is real big huge huge and that's the word is the line so
02:27:58.24 --> 02:28:03.20 for me here's the line get your hands above your head get your feet off the ground that's it right
02:28:03.20 --> 02:28:08.08 I think that's yeah I did I I was otherwise you're like hey you didn't jump
02:28:08.80 --> 02:28:12.72 three inches yeah but what if you know because if you want to do that what you do you put your
02:28:12.72 --> 02:28:18.88 your you put your 135 on the ground a barbell with 135 on it and you hop over that
02:28:18.88 --> 02:28:22.32 and each time chest to the ground on one side chest the ground on the other side chest to the
02:28:22.32 --> 02:28:28.32 that's another way if you're going to require I like when you can't cheat but you can't cheat that
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:33.60 right you have to jump over it yeah no that's what's cool about like burpee pull ups you
02:28:33.60 --> 02:28:38.24 you gotta get chest to the ground I don't care how you do it chest to the ground and get your
02:28:38.24 --> 02:28:41.60 chin over the bar that I don't care what you do in between those two yeah that's a burpee
02:28:41.60 --> 02:28:47.36 making it pretty much alright well then I have to be honest then here's my disclaimer
02:28:47.36 --> 02:28:53.44 the push up it I didn't touch my chest to the ground you need like okay I mean was it like
02:28:53.44 --> 02:29:01.04 was it like an incomplete probably some of them were like I mean I guess I don't do I'm not like
02:29:01.04 --> 02:29:07.28 every single time right yeah here's the thing it's to your discretion right it's like it's like
02:29:07.28 --> 02:29:13.12 that's you know when you didn't do a burpee let's face it if we wanted to you know get some
02:29:13.12 --> 02:29:17.60 Guinness Book of World's right scenario then sure yeah but we we I think you're right
02:29:17.60 --> 02:29:23.60 you know what a burpee is yeah I know what a burpee is yeah get it right yeah so mine and just to
02:29:23.60 --> 02:29:29.44 kind of in the spirit of honesty so I didn't touch my because here's the thing if I was to
02:29:30.48 --> 02:29:34.56 if in on the push up part if you touch your chest over every time you actually slow down enough
02:29:34.56 --> 02:29:40.16 that it's not hitting your cardio as much yeah in my opinion yeah maybe I mean I guess added up
02:29:40.16 --> 02:29:45.52 yeah I guess and you know what I saw though when I saw that guy doing the burpees he was on
02:29:45.52 --> 02:29:50.32 I think it was just a regular gym floor maybe a mat or something and he was doing it and after
02:29:50.32 --> 02:29:54.96 while he starts banging his chest like oh he's showing my goal you're getting a bounce on the
02:29:54.96 --> 02:29:59.52 bench I'm saying yeah getting a little bounce so I'm thinking you know what that could be easier
02:29:59.52 --> 02:30:04.72 for me if I did on a mat I think it'd be easier than having to stop your body weight and not
02:30:04.72 --> 02:30:09.76 touch you know but it's gonna be what you're used to for sure but I didn't touch my chest and
02:30:10.48 --> 02:30:16.32 there were like four of them that I didn't put like four because when I started the set I'm like oh shoot
02:30:16.32 --> 02:30:21.12 those you know two or three I didn't put my hands above my head so I didn't show it yeah you know
02:30:21.12 --> 02:30:26.88 so maybe like four five of them didn't technically count but I feel like if I would have put my hands
02:30:26.88 --> 02:30:32.24 above my head on those four it wouldn't have made a difference that's what I think but if I'm like
02:30:32.24 --> 02:30:36.72 you know the kind where I'm filming at the master you know I'm filming this girl she's doing the
02:30:36.72 --> 02:30:41.20 perfect burpy while I'm filming her chest to the ground in fact when she went chest to ground
02:30:41.20 --> 02:30:44.64 her hands came up off the ground oh just for like a second I'm like dang this feels like
02:30:44.64 --> 02:30:47.68 you know what do they call the girls I think they call this game day pushups I don't know
02:30:47.68 --> 02:30:51.84 okay and I don't know maybe I'm wrong yeah yeah I just called that which is weird exactly
02:30:51.84 --> 02:30:57.68 you have a game day every day's game day so that's what you call it do that every day but
02:30:57.68 --> 02:31:02.88 either way she's doing that and then she's going into the and her hands are straight in the air like
02:31:02.88 --> 02:31:07.04 she's straight up with the everybody's in the shandie I go cross for uh sandy ankle master
02:31:07.04 --> 02:31:13.68 not an autexus I put the clip in the video okay slow mox check it out yeah and she had the perfect
02:31:13.68 --> 02:31:19.92 form full beast mode full on and I'm thinking when I see that compared to the 101 that I did
02:31:19.92 --> 02:31:23.68 no night in day man there would be like yeah he's not doing this whole part here in that
02:31:23.68 --> 02:31:26.48 my hands are going like this they're going like this so they're above my head
02:31:26.48 --> 02:31:30.64 I don't know what I'm gonna like it maybe Brandon Peckworth is doing eight inch or 12 inch
02:31:30.64 --> 02:31:34.64 vertical leap on each one like a beast and we're calling him out and he's actually
02:31:34.64 --> 02:31:39.84 I know he's doing it the cracker and sorry Brandon if that's the case all right good well the
02:31:39.84 --> 02:31:46.08 goal is now 100 I'm gonna follow the protocol I know one in 200 yeah like in a row yeah yeah
02:31:46.08 --> 02:31:51.44 that'd be the big good yeah I'm gonna follow the protocol for sure oh I'll report back anyway
02:31:51.44 --> 02:31:54.56 back to the kettlebells that's a good one the jump rope stuff that's a good one
02:31:54.56 --> 02:31:58.16 on the on it one sets the cool ones my opinion just go on there check it out go on it
02:31:58.16 --> 02:32:06.48 dot com slash jocco boom it's for yourself and the podcast also good way to support
02:32:06.48 --> 02:32:13.12 when you buy these books the jocquer reviews did I chime in to everyone tomorrow good or
02:32:13.12 --> 02:32:19.04 the website joccopadcast.com and chime in much today yeah man I was always kind of a heavy one yeah
02:32:19.04 --> 02:32:26.72 heavy and I'm not gonna so you know what part I was gonna chime in what I respect your decision
02:32:26.72 --> 02:32:31.52 but I respect your decision not to try to get it well you know how you're like it was at the
02:32:31.52 --> 02:32:37.52 end anyway wait you're like this is just one story yeah you know you take and it's a slidly a sliver
02:32:37.52 --> 02:32:43.52 really it is it's a sliver it's one guy and one story it's one guy there is four or five thousand
02:32:43.52 --> 02:32:49.76 British servicemen down there yeah it's one five one four thousand so this this was my comparison
02:32:49.76 --> 02:32:55.12 you know when you're driving in traffic on the street whatever the freeway and all you see is cars
02:32:55.12 --> 02:33:00.32 oh my god infinite cars traffic is everywhere just cars and cars and cars and that's nothing
02:33:00.32 --> 02:33:06.72 new and facts kind of irritating really but if you just take one little step like in your mind and
02:33:06.72 --> 02:33:12.72 and look in the car and look that's a person in there and maybe sometimes two people in there
02:33:12.72 --> 02:33:19.12 sometimes a little family each one of those people has their whole life story all the little
02:33:19.12 --> 02:33:24.80 ups and downs and special things and you know challenges challenge struggles and triumphs all that
02:33:24.80 --> 02:33:29.68 stuff you're one of those little things is a little guy in there and and even then that's no
02:33:29.68 --> 02:33:36.000 buddy compared to everybody so that's analogy I was gonna make but seems kind of trivial you know
02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.32 compared to like guys on the freeway I like our story that's out of police yeah I got a self-cuff
02:33:42.32 --> 02:33:48.88 police anyway back to these books if yeah if you want to get any of these books one or more
02:33:48.88 --> 02:33:54.16 whatever they're listed by episode on the website jocopotcast.com and and by the way we started off
02:33:54.16 --> 02:34:03.20 today before he record record record I said to echo you know you heard the book the what's
02:34:03.20 --> 02:34:09.28 that saying don't judge a book by its cover the cover of this book you can judge it by it's called
02:34:09.28 --> 02:34:17.44 excursion to hell by Lance Corporal Vincent Bramley and the picture on the cover looks like hell
02:34:17.44 --> 02:34:21.04 it looks like it's a picture of him it's blown up real big but yeah you can judge a book by
02:34:21.04 --> 02:34:26.32 its cover you can tell it's gonna be a rough story yeah it looks like he took a straight up excursion
02:34:26.32 --> 02:34:32.08 to hell on that cover but if you want this book go to jocopotcast.com set a little tab on the top
02:34:32.08 --> 02:34:36.80 thing you know top menu whatever books from podcast jocopotcast books whatever it's called
02:34:36.80 --> 02:34:41.92 boom they're listed there by episode click through there get it through there good way to support
02:34:41.92 --> 02:34:48.08 yourself of course and and the podcast takes you to Amazon also or if you're other shop any other
02:34:48.08 --> 02:34:55.60 shopping oh that's a bonus bonus if you buy some port massive good that's still supports it's
02:34:55.60 --> 02:35:02.32 more big time yeah like what like a like a 100 terabyte hard drive how much is that cost like four to five
02:35:02.32 --> 02:35:08.72 grand oh not 45 grand four to five so like 40 depends which one you get or like a lawnmower can you
02:35:08.72 --> 02:35:14.56 buy a lawnmower from Amazon you can now yeah what do they do they they come with a big
02:35:14.56 --> 02:35:20.56 forklift truck and be like oh not that big dude well no no no oh I'm sorry I'm thinking driving on more
02:35:21.28 --> 02:35:26.96 oh so what do they do back it up is your lawnmower I don't know you probably can maybe
02:35:26.96 --> 02:35:31.84 okay treadmill I know you can get a treadmill yeah treadmill is pretty big well either way
02:35:31.84 --> 02:35:38.48 you can do your shopping boom click through there takes a two seconds small action really big reaction
02:35:38.48 --> 02:35:45.28 by way of support I actually have been thinking that that is actually not the best analogy that
02:35:45.28 --> 02:35:50.000 you've been using for like you would think that but you'd be wrong I think a better you ever
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.28 heard of the the expression death by a thousand cuts yes it's more like that even though life by a thousand
02:35:55.28 --> 02:36:02.64 clicks clicks sure yeah support yes yeah man I dig it because they all add up together yeah
02:36:03.04 --> 02:36:08.08 because the sodium is little but it's big but you have to join it with all the other ones yeah so now
02:36:08.08 --> 02:36:14.88 you have a bunch of little sodium's boom huge reaction huge support wide spread huge support
02:36:14.88 --> 02:36:18.96 by this little action from these you know what it is actually the sodium's better because of
02:36:18.96 --> 02:36:22.48 if I'm clicking through I'm a listen I'm listening to this podcast I'm like you know I'm
02:36:22.48 --> 02:36:26.56 gonna support I'm by one of these books I'm gonna you know by lawnmowers treadmill whatever
02:36:26.56 --> 02:36:32.56 I click through the website just that two seconds of going to the website first clicking through
02:36:33.12 --> 02:36:38.48 that's like so much potential in my click just like the the sodium so much potential energy in
02:36:38.48 --> 02:36:42.72 there especially when you mix it with the water you mix it with the Amazon the click boom
02:36:42.72 --> 02:36:50.24 support you follow we can move on yeah there you go back to my point anyway I just to everyone
02:36:50.24 --> 02:36:56.96 for egging that on in some manner yeah well I respect your action ownership in the situation
02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:05.84 just know what you're gonna do to fix the next episode or you could subscribe to the podcast on iTunes
02:37:05.84 --> 02:37:11.60 Stitcher and Google Play if you haven't already I think it seems well I don't want to say it seems obvious
02:37:11.60 --> 02:37:16.72 but yeah if you don't you shouldn't you haven't yeah that's a great support yeah cool
02:37:16.72 --> 02:37:22.32 stay updated all that stuff also on YouTube subscribe to that one I've been putting some stuff
02:37:22.32 --> 02:37:27.36 this is kind of weird to me because we don't have that many YouTube subscribers
02:37:28.96 --> 02:37:34.16 I forget I mean I look but it's not a ton it's not as many people as listen to the podcast
02:37:34.16 --> 02:37:39.20 yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure but not a lot of people are like on YouTube you know okay I'm gonna watch
02:37:40.40 --> 02:37:44.80 you know joc on YouTube yeah like that you're less compelled to do that especially if you're not on
02:37:44.80 --> 02:37:49.12 YouTube just to eat it but what if you miss some of them deleted yeah you know that's something but
02:37:49.12 --> 02:37:54.32 consider like if you never go I would always work with a group this last week and they're full on
02:37:54.32 --> 02:38:00.80 caught up on the podcast every single episode legit dudes getting after it and I mentioned the
02:38:01.44 --> 02:38:06.16 deleted scene that came out and they there are three of them none of them had seen it oh see
02:38:06.16 --> 02:38:11.68 none of them had seen it and that's that's a good scene it's funny anyways yeah I know I use bad
02:38:11.68 --> 02:38:17.36 language but it's got a refreshing breath you know like you can cut loose your like off your
02:38:17.36 --> 02:38:23.36 joc was always on you're off no you're on you're in a different way I was going off

02:38:51.84 --> 02:38:57.04 why it's like so easy so it's really that's a small action big reaction situation another one
02:38:58.56 --> 02:39:04.64 also joc was a store see that time I say it quite I would it's good lord into your trap just moved on
02:39:04.64 --> 02:39:11.28 haha but actually back to the YouTube real quick cause there's other stuff other than just a

02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:39.68 go on there check it out if you like something get something good way to support also psychological
02:40:39.68 --> 02:40:46.000 warfare what psychological warfare is if you don't know it is in album with tracks joc would tracks
02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:52.32 and what he does is on the tracks he's talking to you each track and he's to each track he's talking
02:40:53.04 --> 02:40:58.96 to you about different stuff weaknesses different weaknesses there you go so really this is what you
02:40:58.96 --> 02:41:03.20 need this is a different stuff doesn't cut it yeah because joc was talking about you about the type
02:41:03.20 --> 02:41:09.84 of toothpaste that he uses right right now I didn't say that well maybe it depends you know how
02:41:09.84 --> 02:41:15.04 there's a controversy about for right being in the toothpaste you know I'm just saying that's important
02:41:15.04 --> 02:41:20.56 I'm really egging you on today I'm just saying you brought it up bro anyway what it's really for
02:41:20.56 --> 02:41:31.28 this album is in your campaign against weakness yeah that's the new phrase not journey anymore
02:41:31.28 --> 02:41:40.40 it's campaign against yeah yeah Andy good bread he gave me though because I don't like saying journey
02:41:40.40 --> 02:41:45.04 that's what I'm saying message you and said hey quit saying journey say campaign against weakness
02:41:45.04 --> 02:41:51.68 which is actually from the podcast which is legit layers big time anyway thanks Andy for that one
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:55.68 but that's the one I'm using for right now until like a better one comes up if that's even possible
02:41:55.68 --> 02:42:00.72 so in your campaign against weakness every single day for the rest of your life now that's you're
02:42:00.72 --> 02:42:05.76 in the game right now it's for the rest of your life yeah I can't pay last forever yeah there's no discharge
02:42:05.76 --> 02:42:12.08 for the war yeah I'm a tank so there's how many out big time anyway so if you're trying to wake up
02:42:12.80 --> 02:42:16.40 you know early every day or you know five days a week however long you know however much
02:42:17.28 --> 02:42:20.88 and you got that day where you supposed to wake up early and you don't want to you just don't
02:42:20.88 --> 02:42:28.56 feel like it that's really the thing you don't feel like it you know so joc is there for for you
02:42:28.56 --> 02:42:34.48 with the little spot diet stuff procrastination stuff workout stuff creativity stuff that's a
02:42:34.48 --> 02:42:39.04 big one and I don't listen to the creativity one that's because you feel like you're all creative
02:42:39.04 --> 02:42:43.76 no but here's the thing I'm like one of those things you know how like you know how like let's say
02:42:43.76 --> 02:42:50.48 you had like a pimple or something or is it I know I'm going deep but if you have a zit some people
02:42:50.48 --> 02:42:54.56 they're like I'm gonna pop this in some people they're like no leave it alone let it go away
02:42:54.56 --> 02:42:59.60 you see what I'm saying so I'm like the I'm the latter when it comes to creativity I'm like man
02:42:59.60 --> 02:43:06.24 I'm not creative I'm not creative block don't don't force it don't like get joc on here telling me
02:43:06.96 --> 02:43:12.96 pragmatically by the way but still you have to it now you have no good idea thankfully it's a little
02:43:12.96 --> 02:43:18.40 bit more than that but you know that's kind of the philosophy I'm not saying that's the best way
02:43:18.40 --> 02:43:22.08 in fact I made you a fact you're in the spirit auto you're missing another good
02:43:22.08 --> 02:43:26.72 tenacious d reference that I just made but that's kind of a good thing about this is that that's
02:43:26.72 --> 02:43:31.04 not what it is you know how like you'll explain like you know part of it and this is a total
02:43:31.04 --> 02:43:36.80 pair of phrasing situation but you said it in a really good way before when you're like memorize the
02:43:36.80 --> 02:43:42.48 feeling after you're working or something like that see that's like that's not you're not
02:43:42.48 --> 02:43:48.32 inspiring me to go work out you're kind of pragmatically telling me like this is how you mentally
02:43:48.32 --> 02:43:53.84 wage an effective war on that little weakness there that's what it is you know in tracks
02:43:53.84 --> 02:43:58.40 doing this for all kinds of situations called psychological warfare joc go willing that's a good one

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:05.20 wrote that book yeah well like any situation where it's like your face with a decision to do this thing
02:49:05.20 --> 02:49:09.76 and it's hard but you know it has to be done or should be done or whatever and
02:49:10.48 --> 02:49:14.32 so many times where you just when you shift or someone tells you something hey look at it this
02:49:14.32 --> 02:49:18.40 way and you know like my dad would always say do it and it'll be done and it's like thing
02:49:18.40 --> 02:49:24.32 all it took was really thinking a certain way be safe to your Nancy yeah be see be see says do it

02:49:36.64 --> 02:49:42.40 life pass you by it's up to you also extreme ownership it's still going strong why is extreme
02:49:42.40 --> 02:49:46.16 ownership still going strong is it because the massive advertising campaign that we put
02:49:46.16 --> 02:49:50.96 under the the uh New York Times and the Wall Street Journal no actually we didn't do that you
02:49:50.96 --> 02:49:55.12 know why it's going strong because of word a mouth that's what it's going strong for because
02:49:55.12 --> 02:49:58.40 one person gets it they buy it for this person that person buys it for someone else that person
02:49:58.40 --> 02:50:02.32 buys it for their team that's why we're still selling that thing like crazy why and why was it
02:50:02.32 --> 02:50:08.96 going through word a mouth because it works functionally works it's not theoretical it is pragmatic
02:50:08.96 --> 02:50:15.52 it's functional it'll make you a better leader and it'll make your team better period we've seen
02:50:15.52 --> 02:50:20.40 this over and over and over again that's why it's selling a lot so get yourself and your team
