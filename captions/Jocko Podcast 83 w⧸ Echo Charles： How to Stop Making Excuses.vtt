00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.64
This is Jocco podcast number 83 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.64 --> 00:00:13.36
On the 19th of February

3
00:00:13.36 --> 00:00:16.16
1945

4
00:00:16.16 --> 00:00:19.60
after three days of heavy

5
00:00:20.56 --> 00:00:22.56
pre-landing bombardment

6
00:00:23.36 --> 00:00:24.96
which attempted to destroy the

7
00:00:24.96 --> 00:00:30.000
heavy fortifications that the Japanese had built.

8
00:00:31.92 --> 00:00:39.36
On that day, the 19th of February 1945 in American amphibious forces,

9
00:00:39.36 --> 00:00:45.36
primarily US Marines of the third, fourth, and fifth,

10
00:00:45.36 --> 00:00:52.40
marine divisions along with soldiers from the US Army's 147th Infantry Regiment

11
00:00:52.40 --> 00:00:55.52
landed on the island of Ewo Jima.

12
00:00:58.80 --> 00:01:01.76
By the end of the first day, some battalions had it

13
00:01:01.76 --> 00:01:04.64
caches the rate of over 80 percent

14
00:01:07.84 --> 00:01:13.76
on the morning of 20 February 1945

15
00:01:15.12 --> 00:01:17.20
Marine Corps first lieutenant Isaacs

16
00:01:18.32 --> 00:01:20.24
was taken cover in a foxhole

17
00:01:20.24 --> 00:01:26.32
about 300 yards from the beach when he was hit by a Japanese mortar strike.

18
00:01:28.80 --> 00:01:32.88
He was severely wounded and his left arm and in his head.

19
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:38.08
He was evacuated to a hospital ship offshore

20
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.64
which is where he died the next day

21
00:01:42.64 --> 00:01:47.92
on February 21st 1945.

22
00:01:50.48 --> 00:01:54.16
And it was about two months prior to that

23
00:01:55.52 --> 00:01:59.28
on December 17th 1945 that first lieutenant

24
00:02:00.08 --> 00:02:03.52
Leonard Smith Isaacs had written a letter

25
00:02:04.96 --> 00:02:06.08
to his two boys.

26
00:02:06.08 --> 00:02:13.92
Now, I have a lot of people ask me questions about parenting.

27
00:02:14.96 --> 00:02:19.12
I got four kids so two people want to know my thoughts on it.

28
00:02:19.12 --> 00:02:21.36
People also obviously ask me about war

29
00:02:22.40 --> 00:02:25.44
and they ask me what kind of advice I have for my son.

30
00:02:29.44 --> 00:02:33.36
And I think that first lieutenant Isaacs answers many

31
00:02:33.36 --> 00:02:37.68
of these questions a lot better than I ever could.

32
00:02:41.28 --> 00:02:44.72
And here's what he told them in that letter.

33
00:02:47.28 --> 00:02:52.16
December 17th 1944, my dear little boys,

34
00:02:54.32 --> 00:02:59.28
I'm writing you today just a week before Christmas Eve in the hope

35
00:02:59.28 --> 00:03:02.64
that you will get this little note at Christmas time.

36
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:06.88
All of this coming week will be holidays.

37
00:03:07.60 --> 00:03:10.08
And I can just imagine the fun you will be having,

38
00:03:10.08 --> 00:03:14.32
especially when you know it's just a few days before Santa Claus will be coming.

39
00:03:16.40 --> 00:03:19.68
If it were possible, I would like to come down the chimney myself

40
00:03:19.68 --> 00:03:22.24
and crawl right into your stocking. Wouldn't that be a surprise?

41
00:03:23.92 --> 00:03:25.60
I would enjoy it even more than you.

42
00:03:25.60 --> 00:03:31.12
But since your dad is far away and Santa Claus has the only rain

43
00:03:31.12 --> 00:03:35.52
gears that will fly through ear, I'm afraid we'll have to let Santa Claus use them.

44
00:03:37.28 --> 00:03:41.52
After all, he has so many places to go in such a short time.

45
00:03:44.48 --> 00:03:47.52
I won't be able to give you a Christmas present personally this year.

46
00:03:49.60 --> 00:03:55.20
But I do want you to know that I think of you all the time and feel very proud

47
00:03:55.20 --> 00:03:57.76
of the way you have been helping your mother while I'm gone.

48
00:03:59.76 --> 00:04:04.32
I know that it's only natural for young, healthy and strong boys like you are

49
00:04:04.32 --> 00:04:06.64
to want to play and have fun all the time.

50
00:04:08.24 --> 00:04:10.88
But I do want you to think about helping mummy

51
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.96
because it is hard for her to do everything while I'm gone.

52
00:04:17.20 --> 00:04:20.16
I know that you would like to give me a Christmas present too.

53
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:24.96
So I will tell you what you can do and this will be your Christmas present to me.

54
00:04:27.20 --> 00:04:30.56
Every day ask mummy if there are errands that you can do for her.

55
00:04:31.20 --> 00:04:35.04
And when there are errands to run, say sure, mommy, and then give her a big smile.

56
00:04:35.76 --> 00:04:38.48
Then during the day, go up to your room and look around.

57
00:04:38.48 --> 00:04:43.76
If there are toys scattered all around or you left some of your clothes on the floor, pick them up.

58
00:04:45.92 --> 00:04:49.04
Also, when mummy is busy trying to clean up the house,

59
00:04:49.04 --> 00:04:50.88
don't leave her by herself.

60
00:04:51.68 --> 00:04:54.96
But ask mummy if you can help her take care of baby sister.

61
00:04:56.64 --> 00:05:01.44
If you do those things for me, that will be the finest Christmas present that you could give me.

62
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:08.000
Oh yes, and CC, are you eating your meals like a real man now?

63
00:05:11.04 --> 00:05:16.16
Well, my boys, I guess you often wonder why people fight and have wars

64
00:05:16.16 --> 00:05:21.12
and why lots of daddies have to be a way this Christmas time at fighting.

65
00:05:22.64 --> 00:05:24.88
When it would be much nicer to be at home.

66
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:29.04
That's a hard question to answer.

67
00:05:29.04 --> 00:05:35.76
But you see, some countries like Japan and Germany have people living in them, just like people, you and I know.

68
00:05:37.12 --> 00:05:42.96
Those people want to tell everybody what they can do and what they can't do.

69
00:05:42.96 --> 00:05:47.28
No one likes to be told how to live their life.

70
00:05:48.16 --> 00:05:53.44
I know that you wouldn't like it if one of the boys in the neighborhood tried to tell you what church you should go to,

71
00:05:53.68 --> 00:06:01.36
what school you should go to, and particularly if that boy would always be trying to beat up some smaller or weaker boy.

72
00:06:02.48 --> 00:06:03.60
You wouldn't like it would you?

73
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:11.76
And unfortunately, the only way to make a person like that stop these sort of things or a country like

74
00:06:11.76 --> 00:06:19.68
Japan or Germany is to fight them and beat them and teach them that being a bully because after all,

75
00:06:19.68 --> 00:06:24.64
that's what they are, is not the way to live and that we won't put up with it.

76
00:06:26.64 --> 00:06:29.76
What does all of this mean to you just simply this, my boys,

77
00:06:31.04 --> 00:06:33.12
dad doesn't ever want you to be a bully.

78
00:06:34.40 --> 00:06:37.36
I want you to always fight against anyone who tries to be one.

79
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:43.44
I want you to always help the smaller fellow or the little boy who may not be as strong as you.

80
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:50.000
I want you to always share what you have with the other fellow and above all my boys have courage.

81
00:06:51.60 --> 00:06:54.32
Have courage to do the things that you think are right.

82
00:06:56.48 --> 00:06:59.12
Never be afraid to fight for what you think is right.

83
00:07:00.88 --> 00:07:04.80
To do those things, you need a strong body and a brave heart.

84
00:07:04.80 --> 00:07:09.52
Never run away from someone you may be afraid of.

85
00:07:09.52 --> 00:07:15.84
If you do, you will feel ashamed of yourself and before long, you will find it so easy to run away

86
00:07:15.84 --> 00:07:18.32
from the things that you should stand up and fight against.

87
00:07:21.44 --> 00:07:26.000
If you and lots of other boys try to do the things that dad has been talking about in this

88
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.12
letter, it may be that people will not have to fight wars in the years to come.

89
00:07:31.12 --> 00:07:38.64
And then all the daddies in this world will be home for Christmas.

90
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:42.56
And that is where they belong.

91
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.08
Perhaps some of the things that I've been talking about, you don't quite understand.

92
00:07:52.48 --> 00:07:55.76
If you don't, mommy will explain them to you.

93
00:07:55.76 --> 00:07:58.64
She knows.

94
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:04.16
Merry Christmas and a happy new year.

95
00:08:06.16 --> 00:08:06.88
God bless you.

96
00:08:08.96 --> 00:08:09.36
Daddy.

97
00:08:09.36 --> 00:08:32.16
And obviously, many brave American students fought for what they believed in on that tiny island of

98
00:08:32.16 --> 00:08:47.36
Ewo Jima. And they suffered massive losses to gain that victory over the course of that five

99
00:08:47.36 --> 00:09:01.84
week battle, 19,217 were wounded, 6,800 and 21 were killed.

100
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:17.28
And first lieutenant Leonard Smith, Isaacs, Marine, husband, father,

101
00:09:17.28 --> 00:09:25.84
daddy was buried at sea.

102
00:09:31.28 --> 00:09:32.48
34 years old.

103
00:09:32.48 --> 00:09:34.48
.

104
00:09:46.16 --> 00:09:53.28
Reading that letter made me think about another letter I had read from another parent.

105
00:09:53.28 --> 00:10:04.72
And it's another letter that I find to be just an incredible guide to not only to parenting,

106
00:10:04.72 --> 00:10:05.60
but to living.

107
00:10:08.72 --> 00:10:14.40
And this one was written, not by a father, but by a mother.

108
00:10:15.60 --> 00:10:18.32
And it's not a letter to a son, but to a daughter.

109
00:10:18.32 --> 00:10:23.60
And the daughter's name was Jana.

110
00:10:25.20 --> 00:10:29.36
Then the mother's name was Dr. Mejalda Hora Kova.

111
00:10:32.80 --> 00:10:36.48
And she wrote the letter from prison.

112
00:10:36.48 --> 00:10:47.60
And while she was on trial for treason and for conspiracy, on trial by the Soviet backed communist

113
00:10:47.60 --> 00:10:54.96
government of Czechoslovakia after they had taken control of the country in a coup.

114
00:10:54.96 --> 00:11:09.36
And she and her fellow so-called conspirators were jailed and tortured and then put through a grandiose

115
00:11:09.36 --> 00:11:22.56
show trial. In China, she knew that she was going to be made an example of

116
00:11:22.56 --> 00:11:34.56
China. She was facing death.

117
00:11:35.60 --> 00:11:45.60
And the night before her execution, she wrote a letter to her daughter.

118
00:11:45.60 --> 00:11:53.36
Who was 16 at the time, and this is some of what you wrote.

119
00:11:58.72 --> 00:12:05.84
My only little girl, Jana, God blessed my life as a woman with you.

120
00:12:05.84 --> 00:12:15.92
As your father wrote in the poem from German prison, God gave you to us because he loved us.

121
00:12:18.48 --> 00:12:25.68
Apart from your father's magic, amazing love, you were the greatest gift I received from fate.

122
00:12:28.40 --> 00:12:33.92
However, Providence planned my life in such a way that I could not give you nearly all that my mind

123
00:12:33.92 --> 00:12:42.56
and heart had prepared for you. The reason was not that I loved you little. I love you just as

124
00:12:42.56 --> 00:12:50.48
purely and fervently as other mothers love their children. But I understood that my task here in the

125
00:12:50.48 --> 00:13:02.72
world was to do you good by seeing to it that life becomes better and that all children can live well.

126
00:13:03.76 --> 00:13:07.28
And therefore, we often had to be apart for a long time.

127
00:13:07.28 --> 00:13:18.48
That is now already for the second time that fate has torn us apart.

128
00:13:21.28 --> 00:13:25.28
Don't be frightened and sad because I am not coming back anymore.

129
00:13:25.28 --> 00:13:42.08
Learn my child to look at life early as a serious matter. Life is hard. It does not pamper anybody.

130
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:49.12
And for every time it strokes you, it gives you 10 blows. Become accustomed to that soon.

131
00:13:49.12 --> 00:14:00.96
But don't let it defeat you. Decide to fight. Have courage and clear goals and you will win over life.

132
00:14:03.44 --> 00:14:09.04
Much is still unclear to your young mind and I don't have time left to explain to you things

133
00:14:09.04 --> 00:14:16.000
I would you would still like to ask me. One day when you grow up you will wonder and wonder

134
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.16
why your mother who loved you and whose greatest gift you were managed her life so strangely.

135
00:14:24.96 --> 00:14:30.32
Perhaps then you will find the right solution to this problem. Perhaps a better one than I could

136
00:14:30.32 --> 00:14:40.000
give you today myself. Of course you will not only be able to solve it correctly and truthfully

137
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.44
by knowing very very much not only from books but from people. Learn from everybody.

138
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:59.52
No matter how unimportant. Go through the world with open eyes. And listen not only to your own

139
00:14:59.52 --> 00:15:05.84
pains and interests but also to the pains, interests and longings of others.

140
00:15:05.84 --> 00:15:14.88
Don't ever think of anything as none of your business. No everything must interest you.

141
00:15:14.88 --> 00:15:20.16
Then you should reflect about everything. Compare and compose individual phenomena.

142
00:15:22.48 --> 00:15:31.12
Man doesn't live in the world alone. In that there is great happiness but also a tremendous

143
00:15:31.12 --> 00:15:39.60
responsibility. That obligation is first of all and not being an acting exclusive but rather

144
00:15:39.60 --> 00:15:47.52
merging with the needs and the goals of others. This does not mean to be lost in the multitude

145
00:15:48.56 --> 00:15:54.40
but it is to know that I am part of all and to bring one's best into that community.

146
00:15:54.40 --> 00:16:02.000
If you do that you will succeed in contributing to the common goals of human society.

147
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:10.96
Be more aware of one principle than I have been. Approach everything in life constructively.

148
00:16:10.96 --> 00:16:19.12
Be aware of unnecessary negation. I'm not saying all negation because I believe that one should

149
00:16:19.12 --> 00:16:27.20
resist evil. But in order to be a truly positive person in all circumstances one has to learn

150
00:16:27.20 --> 00:16:36.56
how to distinguish real gold from tinsel. It is hard because tinsel sometimes glitter so dazzingly.

151
00:16:38.48 --> 00:16:43.20
I can fest my child that often in my life I was dazzled by glitter.

152
00:16:43.20 --> 00:16:52.64
And sometimes it even shone so falsely that one dropped pure gold from one's hand and reached

153
00:16:52.64 --> 00:17:02.72
for a ran after false gold. You know that to organize one's scales of values means

154
00:17:03.68 --> 00:17:11.04
to know not only one's self well but to be in firm and in the analysis of one's character.

155
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:19.84
But also to know others to know as much as possible of the world. It's past, it's present,

156
00:17:21.12 --> 00:17:33.20
and future. In short, to understand. Not to close one's ears before anything and for no reason.

157
00:17:33.20 --> 00:17:38.72
Not even to shut out the thoughts and opinions of anybody who stepped on my toes or even wounded

158
00:17:38.72 --> 00:17:51.92
me deeply. Examin. Think. Criticize. Yes, mainly criticize yourself.

159
00:17:54.64 --> 00:18:01.20
Don't be ashamed to admit a truth. You have come to realize even though you proclaim the opposite

160
00:18:01.20 --> 00:18:14.56
a little while ago. Don't become obstinate about your opinions. But when you come to consider

161
00:18:14.56 --> 00:18:18.88
something right, then be so definite that you can fight, then die for it.

162
00:18:22.88 --> 00:18:30.32
As Walker said, death is not bad. Just avoid gradual dying, which is what happens when one suddenly

163
00:18:30.32 --> 00:18:38.72
finds oneself apart from the real life of others. You have to put down your roots where fate has

164
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:44.88
determined you to live. You have to find your own way. Look for it independently. Don't let

165
00:18:44.88 --> 00:18:51.68
anything turn you away from it. Not even the memory of your mother and father. If you really love

166
00:18:51.68 --> 00:18:58.96
them, you won't hurt them by seeing them critically. Just don't go on a road which is wrong,

167
00:18:58.96 --> 00:19:08.88
dishonest and does not harmonize with life. I have changed my mind many times, rearranged many

168
00:19:08.88 --> 00:19:17.44
values, but what was left in as an essential value without which I cannot imagine my life is the

169
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:28.08
freedom of my conscience. I would like you my little girl to think about whether I was right.

170
00:19:33.28 --> 00:19:39.68
Another value is work. I don't know which to assign the first place and which the second,

171
00:19:39.68 --> 00:19:49.20
learn to love work. Any work, but one you have to really know really and thoroughly. Then don't

172
00:19:49.20 --> 00:19:56.24
be afraid of anything and things will turn out well for you. And don't forget about love in your life.

173
00:19:57.68 --> 00:20:03.04
I'm not only thinking of the red blossom which one day will bloom in your heart and you,

174
00:20:03.04 --> 00:20:09.04
if fate favors you, will find a similar one in the heart of another person with whose road yours

175
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:19.12
will merge. I'm thinking of love without which one cannot live happily. I don't ever crumble love,

176
00:20:19.12 --> 00:20:29.28
learn to give it whole and really. And learn to love precisely those who encourage love so little.

177
00:20:29.28 --> 00:20:40.32
My little girl, Janna, when you will be choosing for whom your maiden heart shall burn and to

178
00:20:40.32 --> 00:20:49.12
whom to really give yourself. Remember your father. I don't know if you will meet with such luck as I.

179
00:20:49.84 --> 00:20:56.80
I don't know if you will meet such a beautiful human being but choose your ideal close to him.

180
00:20:56.80 --> 00:21:04.88
Perhaps you, my little one, have already begun to understand and now perhaps you understand to

181
00:21:04.88 --> 00:21:13.28
the point of pain what we have lost in him. What I find hardest to bear is that I am also

182
00:21:13.28 --> 00:21:22.16
guilty of that loss. I've heard from my legal representative that you are doing well in school

183
00:21:22.16 --> 00:21:29.44
and that you want to continue. I was very pleased. But even if you would one day have to leave school

184
00:21:30.24 --> 00:21:37.76
and work for your livelihood, don't stop learning and study. If you really want to, you will reach your goal.

185
00:21:39.60 --> 00:21:44.32
I would have liked for you to become a medical doctor. You remember that we talked about it.

186
00:21:44.32 --> 00:21:55.60
Of course you will decide yourself and circumstances will too. But if you stand one day in the

187
00:21:55.60 --> 00:22:01.36
traditional alma mater and carry home from graduation, not only your doctors to ploma,

188
00:22:01.36 --> 00:22:06.72
but also the real ability to bring people relief as a doctor, then my little girl,

189
00:22:06.72 --> 00:22:18.96
your mother will be immensely pleased. But your mother would only be truly happy no matter where you stand.

190
00:22:20.40 --> 00:22:27.60
Whether at the operating table, at the lathe, at your child's cradle or at the work table in your

191
00:22:27.60 --> 00:22:36.24
household, if you will do your work skillfully, honestly, happily and with your whole being,

192
00:22:38.80 --> 00:22:49.52
then you will be successful in it. Don't be demanding in life, but have high goals.

193
00:22:49.52 --> 00:22:59.92
They are not exclusive of each other. For what I call demanding are those selfish notions and needs,

194
00:22:59.92 --> 00:23:09.20
restrict them from yourself. Realize that in view of the disaster and sorrow which happened to you,

195
00:23:09.20 --> 00:23:15.84
Vera, Pepeck, grandmother and grandfather and many others will try to give you what they have and

196
00:23:15.84 --> 00:23:25.20
what they cannot afford. You should not only not ask for it, but learn to be modest.

197
00:23:26.88 --> 00:23:31.28
If you become used to it, you will not be unhappy because of material things you don't have.

198
00:23:33.20 --> 00:23:37.52
You don't know how free one feels if one trains oneself and modesty.

199
00:23:37.52 --> 00:23:49.20
How he or she gets a head start over against the feeble. And by how much one is safer and stronger,

200
00:23:51.04 --> 00:23:56.88
I really tried this out on myself. And if you can thus double your strength,

201
00:23:56.88 --> 00:24:00.000
you can set yourself courageous high goals.

202
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:10.16
Read much and study languages. You will thereby broaden your life and multiply its content.

203
00:24:12.08 --> 00:24:17.12
There was a time in my life when I read voraciously. And then again, times when

204
00:24:17.12 --> 00:24:21.84
worked did not permit me to take a single book in my hand, apart from professional literature.

205
00:24:23.84 --> 00:24:28.64
That was a shame. Here in recent months, I've been reading a lot,

206
00:24:28.64 --> 00:24:35.04
even books which probably would not interest me outside. But it is a big and important task to

207
00:24:35.04 --> 00:24:42.56
read everything valuable or at least much that is. I shall write down for you at the end of this

208
00:24:42.56 --> 00:24:49.28
letter what I have read in recent months. I'm sure you will think of me when you will be reading it.

209
00:24:49.28 --> 00:24:58.64
And now also something for your body. I'm glad that you are engaged in sports.

210
00:24:59.76 --> 00:25:07.04
Just do it systematically. I think that there should be rhythmic exercises. And if you have time also,

211
00:25:07.92 --> 00:25:13.84
some good systematic gymnastics. And those quarter hours every morning,

212
00:25:13.84 --> 00:25:21.12
believe me, finally, that it would save you a lot of annoyance about unfavorable proportions of

213
00:25:21.12 --> 00:25:30.32
your waist if you could really do it. It is also good for the training of your will and perseverance.

214
00:25:35.20 --> 00:25:42.72
Your photograph showed me your new hairdo. It looks good, but it isn't a shame to hide your nice

215
00:25:42.72 --> 00:25:49.52
forehead and that lady in the ball gown. Really, you look lovely. But your mother's eye noticed one fault,

216
00:25:50.32 --> 00:25:54.80
which may be due to the way you were placed on the photograph. Wasn't the neck opening a little

217
00:25:54.80 --> 00:26:05.12
deep for your 16 years? Don't primp. But whenever possible, dress carefully and neatly.

218
00:26:05.12 --> 00:26:15.44
Jenna, please take good care of grandfather and grandmother.

219
00:26:17.52 --> 00:26:25.52
Their old hearts now need the most consolation. Visit them often and let them tell you about your

220
00:26:25.52 --> 00:26:30.56
fathers and mothers youth so that you can preserve it in your mind for your children.

221
00:26:30.56 --> 00:26:42.000
In that way, an individual becomes immortal and we shall continue in you and the others of your blood.

222
00:26:44.88 --> 00:26:52.48
And one more thing, music. I believe you will show your gratitude to grandfather

223
00:26:52.48 --> 00:26:57.76
for the piano which he gave you by practicing honestly and that you will succeed in what

224
00:26:57.76 --> 00:27:02.64
Pepek wants so much in accompanying him when he plays the violin or the viola.

225
00:27:04.64 --> 00:27:10.32
Please do not favor. I know that it would mean a lot to him and it would be beautiful.

226
00:27:12.88 --> 00:27:20.48
And when you can play well together, play me the Aria from Martha. My rose you bloom alone there

227
00:27:20.48 --> 00:27:28.96
on the hillside and then sleep my little prince by Mozart and then your father's favorite

228
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:40.08
under your window by Chopin. You'll play it for me won't you? I shall always be listening to you.

229
00:27:40.08 --> 00:27:51.84
Just one more thing. Choose your friends carefully. Among other things, one is also very

230
00:27:51.84 --> 00:28:00.24
much determined by the people with whom one associates associates. Therefore choose very carefully.

231
00:28:01.84 --> 00:28:07.44
Be careful in everything and listen to the opinions of others about your girlfriends without being told.

232
00:28:07.44 --> 00:28:14.32
I shall never forget your charming letter. Today I can tell you which you once in the

233
00:28:14.32 --> 00:28:19.60
evening pinned to my pillow to apologize when I caught you for the first time at the gate in the

234
00:28:19.60 --> 00:28:27.04
company of a girl and a boy. You explained to me at that time why it is necessary to have a gang.

235
00:28:29.44 --> 00:28:33.12
Have your gang little girl but of good and clean young people.

236
00:28:33.12 --> 00:28:42.96
And compete with each other in everything good. Only please don't confuse young people spring time

237
00:28:42.96 --> 00:28:53.12
in factuation with real love. Do you understand me? If you don't, on Vera will help you explain

238
00:28:53.12 --> 00:29:10.08
what I meant. And so my only young daughter, little girl, Jenna, new life, my hope,

239
00:29:10.08 --> 00:29:21.36
my future forgiveness, live, grasp life with both hands.

240
00:29:23.68 --> 00:29:29.28
Until my last breath, I shall pray for your happiness, my dear child.

241
00:29:29.28 --> 00:29:43.60
I kiss your hair, eyes and mouth. I stroke you and hold you in my arms.

242
00:29:43.60 --> 00:29:57.84
I shall always be with you.

243
00:29:57.84 --> 00:30:20.32
For the next day, despite international outcry, Milada, Hora-Kova, was executed at Prags

244
00:30:20.32 --> 00:30:27.60
and crack prison.

245
00:30:27.60 --> 00:30:46.64
Again, there's just so much to be learned from those letters and parents.

246
00:30:46.64 --> 00:30:58.16
There's so much for us to teach and I think the thing that hits me is that these are all things

247
00:30:58.16 --> 00:31:06.96
that we know. We know them. We know to take care of our health. We know to wake up and exercise.

248
00:31:06.96 --> 00:31:18.40
We know we should choose our friends carefully. We know we should be our own worst critics.

249
00:31:18.40 --> 00:31:24.88
We know that if we have been wrong about something, we should simply admit that and move our minds

250
00:31:26.32 --> 00:31:31.76
to what is right and what is correct. We know we should work hard and help people.

251
00:31:31.76 --> 00:31:45.28
We know the value of freedom and we know that freedom must be fought for.

252
00:31:47.76 --> 00:31:55.68
We know that we should be brave and that that is possible only through a strong body, mind and heart.

253
00:31:55.68 --> 00:32:03.52
And we know all those things we know them.

254
00:32:05.76 --> 00:32:10.24
Now teach them.

255
00:32:13.12 --> 00:32:18.48
Teach them and live them.

256
00:32:18.48 --> 00:32:28.000
Set the right example by living them.

257
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.80
Because our children are watching.

258
00:32:40.80 --> 00:32:42.72
They're watching it.

259
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:51.84
I think you have to do more than just set the example.

260
00:32:53.84 --> 00:32:57.44
You actually have to tell them.

261
00:32:57.44 --> 00:32:59.36
Think about the power of these letters.

262
00:33:02.48 --> 00:33:04.88
The power of these words.

263
00:33:05.68 --> 00:33:08.08
But it's also a real challenge with kids.

264
00:33:08.08 --> 00:33:15.36
With your own children, it's a challenge because there's a crazy, parental child psychology that's

265
00:33:15.36 --> 00:33:24.24
going on here. You got the rebellion or the trying to please you or the competing for attention

266
00:33:24.24 --> 00:33:26.48
or the I can't do anything good enough.

267
00:33:27.76 --> 00:33:31.28
You've got all these psychological things that are going on with your kids.

268
00:33:31.28 --> 00:33:39.04
And it's hard. It can be very hard just to be straight with your kids about stuff.

269
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:43.92
It can be hard not to micromanage them. That's one of the hardest things because you know so

270
00:33:43.92 --> 00:33:47.92
wow all these things that we just talked about. You know them and you know that they're the best

271
00:33:47.92 --> 00:33:56.32
things for your kids. And yet if you push them to intensely, they're going to push back.

272
00:33:56.32 --> 00:34:00.08
Or they're going to push, they're going to head into different direction.

273
00:34:00.72 --> 00:34:01.84
Because you pushed them there.

274
00:34:04.24 --> 00:34:10.40
But I do think that there's some real value in taking the time to explain

275
00:34:12.16 --> 00:34:15.84
what you've learned. The mistakes that you've made.

276
00:34:15.84 --> 00:34:21.68
I think it's key not to so much focus on telling them how to live. I think this is the key.

277
00:34:21.68 --> 00:34:29.44
It's not so much focus on telling them how to live. But telling them how you have lived.

278
00:34:29.44 --> 00:34:32.24
The mistakes that you've made and how you try to live.

279
00:34:35.44 --> 00:34:44.80
So that maybe they can learn from some of the mistakes that you've made without

280
00:34:44.80 --> 00:34:59.20
having to learn from life itself. Which sometimes life is a much more brutal teacher.

281
00:34:59.60 --> 00:35:06.64
In fact most of the time. And if you have to learn from life, sometimes you don't win.

282
00:35:06.64 --> 00:35:11.68
And harsh. Yeah.

283
00:35:15.68 --> 00:35:16.96
Parenting is challenging.

284
00:35:18.96 --> 00:35:23.60
Part that I thought think is very important.

285
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:34.000
The most important maybe is when you said our children are watching.

286
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.28
So you know remember the old saying, do what I say not what I do. That doesn't work.

287
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.84
Because you tell someone, hey don't don't I don't know what don't smoke. Don't don't try cigarettes.

288
00:35:47.84 --> 00:35:52.64
Meanwhile you smoke. They're going to be like okay don't try cigarettes. You know whatever.

289
00:35:52.64 --> 00:35:57.52
You know they're always like everyday, all day, everyday they're watching. To see how to

290
00:35:57.52 --> 00:36:04.24
what act. I don't know how to act. I don't know what to do in this whole. You know how like when you

291
00:36:04.24 --> 00:36:10.16
walk into a party of someone you don't know. And maybe it's a really nice party or something.

292
00:36:10.16 --> 00:36:14.56
And maybe it's a different culture or something like that. You're looking around. What do I

293
00:36:14.56 --> 00:36:19.12
act? Are we taking off our shoes right here? Okay we're taking off our shoes. Are we are we are we eating

294
00:36:19.12 --> 00:36:23.12
now? Are we waiting for a prayer or something? What do we do? What are we doing? You're constantly

295
00:36:23.12 --> 00:36:28.72
looking on how to add no kids. That's their whole life. Yeah. How do I act? I don't know how to act.

296
00:36:29.60 --> 00:36:35.76
So of course you're there the whole time. You got things figured out. You got a car. You got a house.

297
00:36:35.76 --> 00:36:41.20
You're providing my food. You're going to show me how to act. So you start saying hey don't smoke.

298
00:36:41.20 --> 00:36:48.08
Meanwhile 100% of the time you're acting in a way that allows for smoking.

299
00:36:48.08 --> 00:36:54.40
I mean, maybe like okay. By the way it's the same exact thing from a leadership perspective.

300
00:36:54.40 --> 00:36:59.60
Yeah. The way you act is a leader. It's not I mean that you're not going to have people that are

301
00:36:59.60 --> 00:37:05.20
as moldable as a kid is. But there's no doubt. If the way you act as leaders the way your team is

302
00:37:05.20 --> 00:37:10.000
going to act there's no that's 100%. Yeah. And if you act like a clown your team is going to act

303
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.12
like clowns. If you take your job seriously your team is going to take your job seriously. If you're

304
00:37:15.12 --> 00:37:20.64
very well balanced in between those two where you take your job seriously, but you still have a

305
00:37:20.64 --> 00:37:24.96
good time with the doing it your team is going to follow you with that as well. I remember when I was

306
00:37:24.96 --> 00:37:31.84
a new guy in a shield balloon. I would be watching those my leaders all the time and taking you know

307
00:37:31.84 --> 00:37:35.76
when they didn't do something when they didn't hold the line when they were late or didn't bring the

308
00:37:35.76 --> 00:37:41.20
IP's a gear it was just yeah. You just look at him and shake your head. Now I wanted to perform

309
00:37:41.20 --> 00:37:44.72
but what that meant are the people's like say doesn't matter if we really perform that well look

310
00:37:44.72 --> 00:37:50.32
the boss does new and perform well. Yeah. And so you're setting your body. Yeah you're subordinates are

311
00:37:50.32 --> 00:37:54.88
watching. Yeah everybody's watching. Everybody's watching. You know how people will be like you know

312
00:37:54.88 --> 00:38:00.000
hey I'm the type of person that does this you know I really and everyone knows bad know you're not

313
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.64
we've been watching you the whole time I've known you kind of think. So yeah especially like the

314
00:38:04.64 --> 00:38:09.04
boss too even even I mean you get all kinds of different people right in the in the work environment.

315
00:38:09.04 --> 00:38:13.52
So you you're like driven it comes from yourself. You're like really self like motivated and stuff.

316
00:38:14.40 --> 00:38:21.52
Pretty much. Yeah kind of. So it let's even if you have a bunch of self motivated people

317
00:38:21.52 --> 00:38:24.64
they're still watching you like so if you're like kind of the leader and you're like hey you know

318
00:38:24.64 --> 00:38:29.12
we're getting we're punctual people we get our work done early like we're this kind of and then

319
00:38:29.12 --> 00:38:33.92
meanwhile you're coming in late or whatever the boss is coming in late and he's slacking you could

320
00:38:33.92 --> 00:38:38.96
tell he's slacking he's passing like his job off off you know on to others and that kind of stuff.

321
00:38:38.96 --> 00:38:45.12
At the very least they're gonna look at you and not have the respect it I think you should have

322
00:38:45.12 --> 00:38:50.64
as a boss or whatever. Yeah the very least and that's if you have self motivated people.

323
00:38:50.64 --> 00:38:55.52
But otherwise the normal situation I can't I remember feeling that all the time where I think

324
00:38:55.52 --> 00:39:02.000
about this I'm not going to listen to this guy man. Yeah man it's you know what's interesting to

325
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.72
is just think about and I know we've done all the letters from parents especially from parents

326
00:39:08.72 --> 00:39:16.08
that are you know headed for death or at least a high probability of death but what would you say

327
00:39:16.08 --> 00:39:25.20
to your kids if you knew you were heading there and is it not worth telling them that at some point

328
00:39:25.20 --> 00:39:30.88
while you're alive and you can you can say hey look if you know I'm alive to tell you this

329
00:39:30.88 --> 00:39:36.96
stuff this is what I want you to know again now what's crazy is even with that you have to you

330
00:39:36.96 --> 00:39:43.20
can't override your kids with the gack this way you can't do that you gotta approach it you got

331
00:39:43.20 --> 00:39:50.80
a flank them you got a flank them you got I got a flank my kids my kid you know they're not I think

332
00:39:50.80 --> 00:39:56.40
the classic example is my son he's got it to jiu-jiu right he's been trained in jiu-jiu

333
00:39:56.40 --> 00:40:05.44
ten years right he's 14 he's been trained in his whole life right but he's not as good at jiu-jiu as

334
00:40:05.44 --> 00:40:09.44
I am I mean he's just not because he's been trained in for ten I've been trained in for

335
00:40:09.44 --> 00:40:16.32
twenty something so you can beat him I can beat him yes yes but but check it out what's funny is

336
00:40:17.52 --> 00:40:24.88
I'm his dad so when I tell him a son move your hips over here dude you don't need to do that

337
00:40:24.88 --> 00:40:28.96
I'm thinking myself you've got to be kidding me you've got to be kidding me that is the

338
00:40:28.96 --> 00:40:35.20
content to me that's the ultimate example of your kids are not going to listen to you they're

339
00:40:35.20 --> 00:40:42.48
programmed the programmed to reject you at some point they have to move on right that's the way

340
00:40:42.48 --> 00:40:48.32
the species works if they just continue to take from you and they don't reject you at some point

341
00:40:48.32 --> 00:40:53.68
and get away from you then you didn't do a good job as a parent because now they're relying on you

342
00:40:53.68 --> 00:41:00.16
so but that comes a little price the price is that rebellion right the rebellion's going to come

343
00:41:00.16 --> 00:41:07.04
and it's you know you can you can identify it you know my youngest it's so nice you know you tell

344
00:41:07.04 --> 00:41:10.88
her something and she's just got the big eyes and she wants to help and wants to please and wants

345
00:41:10.88 --> 00:41:15.04
to do and and understand and I'll tell you something else there's another end of the spectrum too

346
00:41:15.04 --> 00:41:22.24
because my oldest daughter she went through the rebellion she's already through that and she got

347
00:41:22.24 --> 00:41:25.84
through it pretty quickly to where she would like look at me and thank you and thank you

348
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:29.84
you could see it in her eyes that she's thinking he knows what he's talking about and I'm going

349
00:41:29.84 --> 00:41:35.84
to listen to what he's saying now it does it's probably like a 50% right there it's not 100%

350
00:41:35.84 --> 00:41:40.72
I'm not just dialing it 100% victory on telling her what to do because otherwise what's sad about

351
00:41:40.72 --> 00:41:46.48
that this is what's horrible about that if you could get a child to actually do everything that

352
00:41:46.48 --> 00:41:51.60
you wanted them to do they would dominate in life right because you would just say okay well you

353
00:41:51.60 --> 00:41:55.20
just study hard I want you to work out I want you to do everything that I'm not doing

354
00:41:55.20 --> 00:42:00.56
because I'm lazy and I fell short of my own goals you'd have to do all that stuff

355
00:42:01.92 --> 00:42:05.20
they're not going to do it so you got to flank you got to figure you also got to figure

356
00:42:05.20 --> 00:42:10.08
which ones are important right which ones are really important don't waste your leadership

357
00:42:10.08 --> 00:42:17.92
capital on you know getting your kids to dress a certain way right that's one parents will

358
00:42:17.92 --> 00:42:23.28
spend all kinds of leadership capital on getting their kids to what dresses are in the way and the

359
00:42:23.28 --> 00:42:32.16
reality is I mean obviously you've got to remain taint some standard of decency and cleanliness

360
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.52
that's another leap by example sit you yeah yeah it is it is my daughters went through little

361
00:42:41.52 --> 00:42:48.88
phase of wearing the short really short jeans or not not jeans but shorts yeah I was like okay cool

362
00:42:49.60 --> 00:42:54.48
I was walking on one day at my house I had like a pair of workout shorts on or whatever

363
00:42:54.48 --> 00:42:59.44
I just pulled them right up yeah and we're just walking on how do I look hey if we're going to show

364
00:42:59.44 --> 00:43:03.52
off let's just show it off right I got a little something to I do squats check me out

365
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:12.48
big girls come up to the agony yeah come on stop yeah that's stopping no that's disgusting yeah

366
00:43:12.48 --> 00:43:18.000
if we're showing off but let's show them off yes I'm over here on the squad but squad rack

367
00:43:20.16 --> 00:43:25.44
let's sport it got it fun you apparently are falling in so let's all flaunt it let's go into town

368
00:43:25.44 --> 00:43:31.36
who's coming with me yeah no no but you but you can only spend so much leadership capital on

369
00:43:31.36 --> 00:43:36.88
getting these minor corrections made what you want to make sure is that they have good morals

370
00:43:36.88 --> 00:43:43.20
value so go out and town they know where to draw the line on doing stuff that's good or not good yeah

371
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.16
you know somebody asked me a question on Twitter I didn't actually answer it fully but you know he's

372
00:43:48.16 --> 00:43:51.68
okay you seem to be really black and white about good or evil but I think there's a lot of shades

373
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:57.20
of gray in there and I totally agree of course I mean there's there's massive amounts of shades of gray

374
00:43:57.20 --> 00:44:04.40
in good and evil and then at some point you get to evil yeah but you go from like hey this is

375
00:44:04.40 --> 00:44:10.16
bad to evil and you go from you know hey that's pretty nice to good those those are things that

376
00:44:10.16 --> 00:44:19.92
exist and you want to keep your kids you know out of the evil right and if you waste all your

377
00:44:19.92 --> 00:44:26.72
leadership capital trying to push them from doing okay and it's a good and doing the best and

378
00:44:26.72 --> 00:44:30.96
you're going to wear it all out in my opinion if there's some parents that have done a better

379
00:44:30.96 --> 00:44:35.36
job than me that's awesome and they were able to just to keep their kid five point oh and every

380
00:44:35.36 --> 00:44:40.64
category across the board for their all existence without the kid turning into a crazy you know

381
00:44:40.64 --> 00:44:47.44
rebel because that's what happens to some kids that get pushed that hard yeah yeah I think that

382
00:44:47.44 --> 00:44:52.88
all again that all leading by example thing man is like as long as you're consistent and lead by

383
00:44:52.88 --> 00:44:57.60
example they can see you know they'll see the benefits play out right in front of their face

384
00:44:57.60 --> 00:45:03.04
yeah but man these again you can you can be like hey clean your room meanwhile the rest of

385
00:45:03.04 --> 00:45:08.000
house including your room is messy and grab clean I tell you to clean your room all the time you never

386
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.68
do no how's this so when I'm my friends uh one of my best friends they've scuddy Lewis he's a cop

387
00:45:15.68 --> 00:45:23.28
by the way you know on the big I know so this guy would he was never my roommate but you know I

388
00:45:23.28 --> 00:45:28.88
go to his house a lot of time and he was real like client clean he was a super clean guy and he'd get

389
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:33.60
kind of mad not mad but just uncomfortable and things are dirty you know so you know if he has a

390
00:45:33.60 --> 00:45:39.84
roommate or something like that and I remember thinking dang bros just got a real sensitive about

391
00:45:39.84 --> 00:45:44.72
that whole thing you know being clean and they're like for real clean clean a clean clean not a

392
00:45:44.72 --> 00:45:51.52
clean freak necessarily but I'm borderline borderline yes so thumbs and just from knowing them

393
00:45:51.52 --> 00:45:58.40
and stuff I knew that his parents they would like you know clean his room and stuff like that

394
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:02.80
not all the time or nothing like that but they were involved in cleaning and stuff so it kind of

395
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:08.96
went opposite to what I thought you know like if your parents tell if you got taught to clean your

396
00:46:08.96 --> 00:46:13.92
room from young age and you had to do it the whole time yeah I always thought that yeah that

397
00:46:13.92 --> 00:46:17.52
would carry over when you're out of the house and you go to college you go live on your own

398
00:46:17.52 --> 00:46:23.20
that you clean your room all the time I thought that that was kind of it but I started hypothesized

399
00:46:23.20 --> 00:46:29.44
that that's not it this is what it is if your parents provide an environment of extreme

400
00:46:29.44 --> 00:46:35.12
cleanliness whether you do it or they do it or both or whatever but the environment is consistently clean

401
00:46:35.76 --> 00:46:40.48
when you leave that environment that's will be that'll be what you're used to it's a little mess

402
00:46:40.48 --> 00:46:45.76
with you if it's not and that's and sure enough we went to the big of and you know crazy

403
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:53.04
and we go to his house and it's like museum the spotless clean not his his parents house

404
00:46:54.24 --> 00:46:59.20
and I remember thinking like yeah that my little theory I think is correct yeah like if you're

405
00:46:59.20 --> 00:47:04.24
used to doing it did his parents help him clean or not yes fully so here and here's the thing

406
00:47:04.24 --> 00:47:08.80
because because you could also get the kid that the parents are neat freaks and the kid rebels

407
00:47:08.80 --> 00:47:14.24
and just becomes a slob yeah so and yeah maybe and I'm sure there's all kinds of circumstance

408
00:47:14.24 --> 00:47:19.44
that maybe do that I'm sure but I mean generally speaking the environment that you get used to

409
00:47:19.44 --> 00:47:24.72
functioning also there's people there's parents that are slob's that the kids are very

410
00:47:24.72 --> 00:47:29.92
neat nor do they because they don't like that yeah yeah I mean maybe and again these are all

411
00:47:29.92 --> 00:47:35.28
you know I'm sure there's so many five I've never encountered that well my I think the key is here

412
00:47:35.28 --> 00:47:40.64
what you can't do is just trying to push them like crazy you just have to guide them and what

413
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:46.24
is correct and what you have to really show is like the benefits of why it's good to keep things

414
00:47:46.24 --> 00:47:53.36
in order you know if you're gonna spend an hour looking for your car keys just think of your

415
00:47:53.36 --> 00:48:00.72
productivity at that point it's no yeah so you gotta watch out for that yeah but yeah that was

416
00:48:00.72 --> 00:48:05.04
my little hypothesis I think it's true though because think about like think about just the environment

417
00:48:05.04 --> 00:48:11.92
of the the consistent environment that you kind of that it someone will come from they always in a way

418
00:48:12.80 --> 00:48:17.68
sort of for lack of better to create recreate that environment or try to when they leave so like

419
00:48:17.68 --> 00:48:22.16
you know how like kids they come from a chaotic people yell out yeah they're gonna probably yell a lot

420
00:48:22.16 --> 00:48:27.12
or let's say they don't yell let's say they never swear right they like I grew up in a household

421
00:48:27.12 --> 00:48:31.12
and they don't swear and swearing like not that good when they go out they won't just start swearing

422
00:48:31.12 --> 00:48:36.96
though they'll be sensitive to swearing for sure so I think if that again if the environment is

423
00:48:36.96 --> 00:48:42.40
provided consistently I think that's that's gonna have a big consistency goes a long way

424
00:48:42.40 --> 00:48:46.88
oh I think it's the number one thing Sarah Armstrong always says that yeah I agree with there

425
00:48:46.88 --> 00:48:52.16
thousand million people you consistent right even like small little things like for my

426
00:48:52.16 --> 00:48:59.36
doctor for example it's the routine is when it's time to go to bed it's brush teeth we do

427
00:48:59.36 --> 00:49:03.92
stories and questions which is like just you know some stories that I mean and then questions like

428
00:49:03.92 --> 00:49:08.80
basically a quiz it's like rudimentary education like solar system stuff and you make it like a

429
00:49:08.80 --> 00:49:18.40
game show quiz so it's fun and then bed time that's it then sleep 100% no deviation unless we're

430
00:49:18.40 --> 00:49:24.88
out but that's how you roll that's the routine consistent so now I don't get any push back

431
00:49:24.88 --> 00:49:30.96
my daughter is a push back she is master in that the consistency it's up she just knows she

432
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:36.08
just go you can be playing she's she's got a little spark to her yeah I actually just got a lot of

433
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:45.20
spark to her yeah yeah there's just a ton you know as I was going through these I don't remember

434
00:49:45.20 --> 00:49:51.28
where I let read the you know I don't remember where I read this letter for the first time

435
00:49:51.28 --> 00:50:00.96
from Milata or a kova but there's so much good stuff in there chose your friends carefully

436
00:50:00.96 --> 00:50:08.000
I mean just just when she's kicking it off you know life is hard it does not pamper anybody

437
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.12
that's a good thing for kids to understand yeah you know welcome to life it's going to be hard

438
00:50:13.12 --> 00:50:20.32
get accustomed to it but don't let it defeat you boom yeah that's changing of your opinion one was

439
00:50:20.32 --> 00:50:26.72
yeah yeah and admitting when you're wrong if I made this if I made if I had the wrong theory

440
00:50:26.72 --> 00:50:31.44
that's okay yeah I'm just good for me you information here we go I'm changing that's okay

441
00:50:31.44 --> 00:50:35.84
I was kind of freaked me out with politicians I think you've had this conversation before

442
00:50:35.84 --> 00:50:39.84
politicians people say we've flipped flop flip flop for you and that's a negative thing

443
00:50:39.84 --> 00:50:44.48
it's a negative thing if the person is flip flopping just to get votes yeah and it's not

444
00:50:44.48 --> 00:50:48.24
but if new stuff comes to light and they say you know what I kind of changed my opinion on that one yeah

445
00:50:48.96 --> 00:50:54.32
yeah or the culture shifts man like there's certain things that's even I mean back to your

446
00:50:54.32 --> 00:50:58.72
thing with the short shorts that's I mean pointy is a little bit different but you have to

447
00:50:58.72 --> 00:51:04.56
contend with yeah cultural history that's a new reality for me like in in Hawaii for example when

448
00:51:04.56 --> 00:51:10.000
I grew up like just the swimsuits um we're you know sure you wear bikini but it's like a normal bikini

449
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.04
so I come I got a college I come here I move here I go back this is like you know 10 11 years

450
00:51:17.04 --> 00:51:22.40
later I'm noticing the bikinis in there it's just way less material I'm like dang there's

451
00:51:22.40 --> 00:51:26.64
they're showing a lot but everyone's just you know little kids and stuff like I'm okay and my

452
00:51:26.64 --> 00:51:30.80
younger brother will live there you said that's just how this is now is like man you you wouldn't

453
00:51:30.80 --> 00:51:34.48
know that's that's that's some stuff that I had to like go okay I'm not gonna expend a

454
00:51:34.48 --> 00:51:41.68
natural leadership capital fighting not just my kids but fighting culture as a whole yeah that's

455
00:51:41.68 --> 00:51:47.84
but then there's things that cross the line right yeah you wear in those short shorts that's

456
00:51:47.84 --> 00:51:54.64
not that delay you don't want to see me in those short shorts you don't want to have that happen

457
00:51:54.64 --> 00:52:05.28
so um like I said it's a good information from Captain Isaacs and from Doctor Hork over

458
00:52:06.88 --> 00:52:15.52
but you know speaking of learning and teaching and questioning speaking of question time sure

459
00:52:15.52 --> 00:52:24.56
I think we have a little question time to contend with you okay you're nay yeah might as well so let's uh

460
00:52:23.76 --> 00:52:28.96
ask Jocco some questions let's do that I like your answers to questions Jocco

461
00:52:30.72 --> 00:52:36.16
see that's kind of the good thing about knowing your phone number I could just text you with questions

462
00:52:36.16 --> 00:52:42.40
like purse my own questions a gross mismanagement of your time it is potentially however I'm pretty

463
00:52:42.40 --> 00:52:50.000
quick to answer yeah abruptly in short answers you know because you pretty much know what the answer

464
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.36
is gonna be I do and sometimes you just need that backup and that's or that that reinforcement you

465
00:52:55.36 --> 00:53:00.88
know you know you know how like you're like man I really have I have in this issue with myself

466
00:53:00.88 --> 00:53:06.64
whatever like I'm gonna I'm gonna ask Jocco only because it's really I'm really confused

467
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:11.84
not confused but you know I'm really I need the answer I don't have the I'm really want to I'm gonna ask Jocco and

468
00:53:11.84 --> 00:53:17.92
you can be texting Jocco the answer or the question and you're like I know that answer like as I'm

469
00:53:17.92 --> 00:53:23.36
reading this question to Jocco it kind of fits into it yeah so don't send it so you get about maybe

470
00:53:23.36 --> 00:53:29.76
a third and like a quarter of the questions that I actually started for you yeah that's good

471
00:53:29.76 --> 00:53:36.80
yeah man see good you know the Jocco effect is real question number one Jocco I keep trying to ask

472
00:53:36.80 --> 00:53:43.44
around my BJJ school if anyone follows S and C program did now you just abbreviate S and C you know

473
00:53:43.44 --> 00:53:49.44
what that is right no oh it's strength and conditioning okay sure all hundred percent

474
00:53:50.80 --> 00:53:55.76
that's like a known thing especially for someone that's jacked like no it's not

475
00:53:55.76 --> 00:54:00.08
just interesting thing condition I don't right I've never seen that you know that's maybe it'll

476
00:54:00.08 --> 00:54:05.44
write that maybe I just do it that through credit just credit Mike drop you know I'm not

477
00:54:07.84 --> 00:54:13.68
anyway I'm asking around my BJJ school if anyone follows a strength and conditioning program

478
00:54:13.68 --> 00:54:20.80
for comps which is competition very good nicely done you're up on things everyone keeps telling

479
00:54:20.80 --> 00:54:27.12
me to just roll for strength and conditioning what do you think about that okay so rolling is

480
00:54:27.12 --> 00:54:32.72
obviously the base right you need to roll and that but that has to it that this doesn't mean

481
00:54:32.72 --> 00:54:39.04
include rolling like we're gonna go roll however it works out it means rolling with some kind of

482
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:46.64
structure around it so you get your short rounds you got to get your long rounds you got to get your

483
00:54:46.64 --> 00:54:51.52
shark tanks you got to get your positional drilling you got to get your consequence free drills

484
00:54:52.08 --> 00:54:59.68
like Dean Lister makes us do consequence free drills where you're gonna start in a position where

485
00:54:59.68 --> 00:55:03.28
you might get tapped out but it doesn't matter all right right or you're gonna start a position

486
00:55:03.28 --> 00:55:08.56
where you might lose position but you're gonna do it anyways and and then Glover that's what Dean does

487
00:55:08.56 --> 00:55:15.12
actually Glover does the consequence drills where you hear already like starting in the arm lock

488
00:55:15.12 --> 00:55:19.52
yeah yeah yeah you're letting a person take your arm and you're starting there and you're just

489
00:55:19.52 --> 00:55:24.64
gonna see what you can get out of it or start in the triangle not the triangle danger in the triangle

490
00:55:24.64 --> 00:55:32.40
yeah that's some Jeff Glover you know we did that crap right there but it's good for you it's good

491
00:55:32.40 --> 00:55:36.000
so you got to you got to do that you know and the short rounds by short rounds I mean short

492
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:44.000
intense rounds yeah right if you I'm my attitude in a three-minute round is completely different

493
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.68
than my attitude in a twenty-minute round or even I mean the ultimate and what believe it or not

494
00:55:50.80 --> 00:55:56.80
my attitude in a twenty-minute round is different from my attitude in a no-time limit round

495
00:55:57.36 --> 00:56:03.52
really yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's especially because in regular training even if you

496
00:56:03.52 --> 00:56:11.04
get the submission if I submit you in four minutes I still got to do another sixteen so I might

497
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:15.36
go all hard for four minutes and get the submission but then I gotta go another sixteen minutes now

498
00:56:15.36 --> 00:56:20.32
so I'm gonna I'm gonna have some tactical now if we're now what's different is if it's no time

499
00:56:20.32 --> 00:56:25.60
limit after four minutes I get you work we're kind of done we can go again yeah but

500
00:56:25.60 --> 00:56:31.44
we can just be done but if you get them in one minute we're probably going again yeah it's like

501
00:56:31.44 --> 00:56:37.76
an MV it's in four minutes is probably going again too but like eight minutes so I might I might not

502
00:56:37.76 --> 00:56:45.12
submit you in one minute or even four minutes because I want to get you to a point where I know

503
00:56:45.12 --> 00:56:52.56
I'm just gonna have to do this one guy yeah yeah yeah the psychology uh but so yes you have to roll

504
00:56:52.56 --> 00:56:58.24
now but you still need to get stronger right and a classic example this is a big Andy big Andy

505
00:56:58.24 --> 00:57:06.24
Burke right great you're just you but it wasn't super strong yeah and I was I said to him hey

506
00:57:06.24 --> 00:57:10.32
start doing pull-ups start doing push-ups and dips and squats just start to him and he did

507
00:57:10.32 --> 00:57:16.40
he listened to me and and in a matter of a month he felt completely different because he

508
00:57:16.40 --> 00:57:21.36
wasn't working on it he was just rolling and he was rolling hard core but just rolling compared

509
00:57:21.36 --> 00:57:28.56
to actually getting stronger and then he went on to powerlifting and Olympic lifting and now it's

510
00:57:28.56 --> 00:57:33.20
like okay I gotta contend with actual strength power here so that that definitely makes a difference

511
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:36.80
you know his skill was getting better but it wasn't I was feeling it skill getting better you know but

512
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:40.32
we're all getting better at the same time but all of a sudden he started getting stronger so strength

513
00:57:40.32 --> 00:57:46.56
that's the strength part right now the conditioning part same thing due to a how's you to

514
00:57:47.12 --> 00:57:54.000
rest and that's actually a positive attribute of your due to your game if you can rest while you're doing it

515
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.64
right that's that's one of the good that's that proves that you know what you're doing

516
00:57:58.64 --> 00:58:04.72
right now that's actually a negative when it comes to working out because if you do something like

517
00:58:04.72 --> 00:58:11.28
a row or a bike or a sprint or a medcon workout on a timer there and no mercy

518
00:58:12.40 --> 00:58:19.04
slacking is not rewarded you're you're you're racing against the clock and so those things are

519
00:58:19.04 --> 00:58:29.28
gonna push you faster for longer periods of time harder than just a role well so bottom line for

520
00:58:29.28 --> 00:58:36.000
strength and conditioning and you get to yeah you gotta do you get to for sure gotta be your base

521
00:58:37.12 --> 00:58:45.44
and then you've got to do strength training to get stronger that's dead and squats and clean

522
00:58:45.44 --> 00:58:50.000
jerks and snatches and over at squats and all the key lifts and do that means doing singles and

523
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.44
doubles and fours and fives and sets of 20 I mean it means getting stronger and then you got to

524
00:58:57.44 --> 00:59:04.56
work your metabolic conditioning and how do you do that you go hard you go metabolic conditions

525
00:59:04.56 --> 00:59:11.44
do you do met cons right you mix in lighter weights doing more repetitions short and you got

526
00:59:11.44 --> 00:59:16.32
a mix up the rounds too going short rounds long rounds to bot do you know what to bot is

527
00:59:18.08 --> 00:59:23.68
to bot a protocol I don't know the exact exact number there's an exact number the exact number

528
00:59:23.68 --> 00:59:33.44
for the to bot a protocol is 33 no 20 seconds of work 10 seconds of rest okay so for me that's

529
00:59:33.44 --> 00:59:37.84
like the shortest rounds you're doing is 20 seconds of work 10 seconds of rest then you got all

530
00:59:37.84 --> 00:59:44.56
to do long rounds and then you do you know a lot of times I do three on one off for rounds that's

531
00:59:44.56 --> 00:59:53.20
a boxing right a lot of times I'm doing five on one off that's MMA and then above that you start

532
00:59:53.20 --> 00:59:59.60
to get to Gittu which is 10 minutes will one off but what's interesting is if you're doing a

533
00:59:59.60 --> 01:00:03.20
10 minute round and then one off and then another 10 minute round and then one off that blurs

534
01:00:03.20 --> 01:00:07.52
into one big round so a lot of times when we're getting it got a guy that's competing black

535
01:00:07.52 --> 01:00:13.44
belt or a or he's doing a 20 minute fight or a 10 minute fight a 10 minute 10 minute grappling

536
01:00:13.44 --> 01:00:19.04
match one round of 10 minutes or one round of 15 minutes you got to have him take a bigger break

537
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:23.12
in between sometimes during the training so that they're actually coming in their fresh

538
01:00:23.12 --> 01:00:28.000
and they can work through the prom again otherwise they're just going through the one hour roll

539
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.60
level the whole time which is not good for them and obviously you got to learn technique

540
01:00:35.60 --> 01:00:41.28
you got to practice technique because Gittu is what's going to win and like I just had somebody

541
01:00:41.28 --> 01:00:46.72
hit me up on social media and they said because I told a story at some point on this podcast about

542
01:00:47.60 --> 01:00:52.08
rolling with a black belt girl for the first time as the first time I ever rolled

543
01:00:52.08 --> 01:00:56.64
with an actual black belt girl and I was thinking you know I better bring my A game a little

544
01:00:56.64 --> 01:01:01.04
bit so don't get caught here and then when I started rolling with those that's not happening

545
01:01:02.08 --> 01:01:06.48
and the guy says this is this mean that you can't defeat a stronger opponent with Gittu and I

546
01:01:06.48 --> 01:01:15.52
said no absolutely my watch girls lighter weaker girls tap out bigger stronger guys on the regular

547
01:01:16.40 --> 01:01:23.36
but what what that situation was not only was I bigger and stronger but I'm also skilled at Gittu

548
01:01:23.36 --> 01:01:30.48
yes so doesn't apply yeah and there's this element of Gittu and this actually kind of goes back to

549
01:01:31.68 --> 01:01:37.52
one Andy when you know when you get Andy with his skill and technique

550
01:01:38.88 --> 01:01:44.000
and then you add some strength in conditioning to it and it's like you know so what you do if you

551
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.72
if you don't have if you're not being strong you can't really believe anyone on the man

552
01:01:48.72 --> 01:01:54.64
bully I don't mean bully bully I mean like you can't just turn on this like if you're not

553
01:01:54.64 --> 01:01:59.92
yeah if you're seeing Jeff Glover but people because I have well he bullies in in a different way

554
01:01:59.92 --> 01:02:06.48
like so so and that's what I mean by bully like you can't just impose your strength on someone

555
01:02:06.48 --> 01:02:11.36
well I'm gonna have to disagree with you can impose your technique yeah I think yeah I mean

556
01:02:11.36 --> 01:02:16.56
Jeff Glover will bully guys on the mat if they're out of line for sure yeah but in it's in a

557
01:02:16.56 --> 01:02:21.36
different kind of way so you're talking about you well you can't go strength you can't just

558
01:02:21.36 --> 01:02:27.04
start bullying physically bullying you have to technically bully it yes so I accept that yeah so let's

559
01:02:27.04 --> 01:02:35.68
say your technique is is similar and but you have straight up weight strength and conditioning

560
01:02:35.68 --> 01:02:40.96
yeah it really plays a factor first sure and not to say that you'll be able to necessarily tap

561
01:02:40.96 --> 01:02:47.44
the guy out but him trying to tap you out when you have strength conditioning and size it's like

562
01:02:47.44 --> 01:02:52.88
it just gets real hard no for sure and unless you will be the key component there that you

563
01:02:52.88 --> 01:03:02.000
mentioned is that I have to have similar because you can be a 235 pound like guy super strong

564
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.44
athlete and if you don't know jjitsu Jeff Glover's gonna wrap you up like you don't even know what's

565
01:03:07.44 --> 01:03:14.08
happening he's 150 pounds yeah yeah yeah well and he and I've seen him with obviously with what

566
01:03:14.08 --> 01:03:21.76
roughly 100% certainty with with yeah well you know even beyond roughly 100% it is really really

567
01:03:21.76 --> 01:03:29.20
close to 100% yeah if you don't know jjitsu 245 pound muscle head going against Jeff Glover you're

568
01:03:29.20 --> 01:03:34.24
getting tapped out you do know jjitsu there he is yeah for sure there is a video I think is

569
01:03:34.24 --> 01:03:38.24
crappler's quest I think it's still online right now Jeff Glover goes against this huge

570
01:03:38.24 --> 01:03:42.88
guy yeah for sure I think yeah he's maybe like I knew some people of you who did you just

571
01:03:42.88 --> 01:03:47.76
who fighter yeah it was a jjitsu match yeah and helmet it's yeah it's just crazy to watch and

572
01:03:47.76 --> 01:03:58.32
that was when Jeff was like 13 or something yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the girl you know the

573
01:03:58.32 --> 01:04:01.68
girl thing and I remember that question was on Twitter right there was like hey it doesn't

574
01:04:01.68 --> 01:04:08.96
jjitsu allow you yes yeah so they get yeah perfect exact I mean that's the answer there

575
01:04:08.96 --> 01:04:12.64
because yeah you have all this experience but you know how like how we always talk about like

576
01:04:12.64 --> 01:04:16.96
when you lock up with someone you know you can get a really good idea of what they're about to

577
01:04:16.96 --> 01:04:22.64
bring to you yeah this James Nielsen and you lock up and you're like what is it about this should

578
01:04:22.64 --> 01:04:27.12
be pretty easy oh yeah getting swaps yeah you're not just happy for sure for sure so there are

579
01:04:27.12 --> 01:04:33.44
exceptions for sure but generally speaking you know even just not even beyond just strength strength

580
01:04:33.44 --> 01:04:39.36
and their grip and their rigidity and yeah you can feel the you can feel the either like they're

581
01:04:39.36 --> 01:04:43.60
relaxed to me that's an indicator yeah someone that just like it's one of them yeah they feel

582
01:04:43.60 --> 01:04:47.04
relaxed you're like okay this is this guy probably knows what he's doing yeah because the person

583
01:04:47.04 --> 01:04:51.52
that doesn't know what they're doing they're going all psycho yes doing making like little micro moves

584
01:04:51.52 --> 01:04:55.28
that are incorrect you know yeah just even putting their foot right there it's like bro your

585
01:04:55.28 --> 01:04:59.52
foot should not be right there right now kind of thing yeah you can tell real quick yeah so but it

586
01:04:59.52 --> 01:05:04.64
does go into the strength part as well so like you know when you grab someone's wrist or they grab

587
01:05:04.64 --> 01:05:08.72
your wrist or something like that you're like okay because a lot of you just to this is weird a lot

588
01:05:08.72 --> 01:05:13.04
of you get to is knowing what's important and what's not in pressure so you know these that's not

589
01:05:13.04 --> 01:05:17.60
just you get to either because I just talked about that with with kids and with me know you

590
01:05:17.60 --> 01:05:22.08
and you want to expand your leadership capital trying to get your trying to get your team to do

591
01:05:22.08 --> 01:05:28.24
something that's not really truly necessary yeah that's not going to help your cause yeah it's not

592
01:05:28.24 --> 01:05:31.36
going to help you and you did to if you're focused on something that's not important and to know

593
01:05:31.36 --> 01:05:35.04
what's important and what's not is very important has a leader as a parent and is on the

594
01:05:35.04 --> 01:05:43.44
duty to play or match yes of justice and very hard by the way it takes like a lot of experience

595
01:05:43.44 --> 01:05:49.60
so you consider these guys who are like if you do a light role with a really really high level guy

596
01:05:49.60 --> 01:05:54.48
that's when you can start to see okay this guy really thinks that this arm position is really

597
01:05:54.48 --> 01:06:00.000
important because he'll fight till the death to kind of maintain it you know so but what the

598
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.56
bad just back to the girl real quick the girl situation when you lock up with someone's strengthwise

599
01:06:04.56 --> 01:06:10.24
you know you feel like I said you what they're about to bring so again and when you have the

600
01:06:10.24 --> 01:06:15.04
more experience you have the more you're gonna know with like more accuracy and that's what you

601
01:06:15.04 --> 01:06:21.28
and actually this point of taking that point in transferring into leadership is so critical and I'll

602
01:06:21.28 --> 01:06:29.04
tell you I am really good at knowing what's important and what's not and just be it and you can

603
01:06:29.04 --> 01:06:35.92
see people that get all spun up about things and you know just okay they're spun up about something

604
01:06:35.92 --> 01:06:40.40
the same thing with family life you know your your wife gets all spun up about something like what

605
01:06:40.40 --> 01:06:45.12
we're gonna do we're gonna keep doing what we're doing we're gonna be okay you know oh you want to

606
01:06:45.12 --> 01:06:49.28
focus all your time and energy on that that's fine go ahead you know that's cool I'll support you

607
01:06:49.28 --> 01:06:54.48
and you can make it happen but you know think about how important something really is when you're

608
01:06:54.48 --> 01:06:58.88
getting spun up about something just think about how important it really is there's a good chance

609
01:06:59.84 --> 01:07:04.72
it's not that important there's a really good chance it's not that important there's usually four

610
01:07:04.72 --> 01:07:11.12
five things that are really important as a leader that you need to focus on and that list the

611
01:07:11.12 --> 01:07:14.88
further you go down that list the less important things are and I see leaders get spun up on

612
01:07:14.88 --> 01:07:20.000
things that are listed on the list number 47 and they're acting like it's the most important thing

613
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.60
and it's gonna ruin everything and it's like no doesn't just not that big of a deal yeah

614
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:31.36
so learn that is that why you wear the same clothes every day you know I wear the same

615
01:07:31.36 --> 01:07:38.000
because fashion is not important it's not important to me those short rounds are good when you

616
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.64
do short rounds in jiu jitsu and they kind of trick you too because like Jeff will do that he'll be like

617
01:07:42.64 --> 01:07:46.56
three minute rounds so you have this thing in your head like oh it's only three minutes it's just

618
01:07:46.56 --> 01:07:50.88
hard but meanwhile you only got 30 seconds or ask me for you gotta go again so you're doing

619
01:07:50.88 --> 01:07:55.84
essentially a back on jiu jitsu and that's good that is good so for that kind of stuff yeah man it's good

620
01:07:56.48 --> 01:08:00.48
yeah agree I like to say some of you got some guys say you don't need strength and

621
01:08:00.48 --> 01:08:04.40
conditioning because you the more the anytime you spend doing physical activity should be on your

622
01:08:04.40 --> 01:08:11.04
jiu jitsu they said that's interesting I would like to agree with that it sounds good but I would do

623
01:08:11.60 --> 01:08:15.76
if I'm gonna do jiu jitsu six hours a day I'd still do strength and conditioning for 20 minutes

624
01:08:15.76 --> 01:08:20.40
half an hour or four minutes that's one of the good things about jiu jitsu you can have different

625
01:08:20.40 --> 01:08:26.80
philosophies and still be successful because I think like there it gets Dylan Dennis or somebody

626
01:08:26.80 --> 01:08:31.76
maybe Marcel Marcel Garcia only does jiu jitsu yeah I know and Dean you still always trying to convince

627
01:08:31.76 --> 01:08:36.96
me that yeah it's gonna do jiu jitsu let's say no well Dean's all crazy strong though yeah no he's

628
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:41.04
that's funny you see the fail just to jiu jitsu when I was just a jiu jitsu and I mean just I

629
01:08:41.04 --> 01:08:45.76
I don't know why don't do grip strength right now I can hold him to anything for about six hours

630
01:08:47.76 --> 01:08:54.56
check all right next question jiu jiu jiu jiu I have a question about leadership firefighter

631
01:08:54.56 --> 01:09:01.20
and someone like guys on my department have been pushing me to step up and put in for an

632
01:09:01.20 --> 01:09:08.32
officers position and I'm honored but one word one word one we were going to a call I was presented

633
01:09:08.32 --> 01:09:15.52
with an opportunity to lead and pass it up I don't know what I was thinking I can't believe I did that

634
01:09:15.52 --> 01:09:25.28
did I just lose credibility if I did is there a was to get that back away right that's what he meant

635
01:09:25.28 --> 01:09:31.36
yeah if I did is there a way to get that back thanks okay so first of all this is just a general

636
01:09:31.36 --> 01:09:36.88
rule if you want to lead always be ready to lead right be ready to step up make sure you're not stepping

637
01:09:36.88 --> 01:09:42.80
on people's toes as always but be ready to lead and the way you do that is you think about you what

638
01:09:42.80 --> 01:09:46.72
you do in certain situations you should always be thinking about that you should be thinking

639
01:09:46.72 --> 01:09:52.16
even if you're a trooper or a follower in a certain situation you should think okay well how

640
01:09:52.16 --> 01:09:57.68
would I lead what would I do right now what moves would I make what would I do if a contingency

641
01:09:57.68 --> 01:10:01.36
happened right now and what are the possible contingencies that I could be looking at what are

642
01:10:01.36 --> 01:10:10.16
they and if you're thinking that as a as a frontline guy when the opportunity pops up

643
01:10:10.16 --> 01:10:16.96
then just jump on it boom there you go then when it does happen of course you've got to

644
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:22.48
stay detached because you want to make sure that you don't lead too far you don't overstep

645
01:10:22.48 --> 01:10:27.92
your bounds and step on toes you've got to be careful that so you need to live with that mindset

646
01:10:28.64 --> 01:10:34.24
and that will make you such a a better leader when the moment does come if you're always thinking

647
01:10:34.24 --> 01:10:37.36
about if you're always watching like he talked about earlier I'm watching the leader I'm

648
01:10:37.36 --> 01:10:40.64
seeing what they're doing I'm seeing what I might do differently I'm still supporting them

649
01:10:40.64 --> 01:10:44.000
I'm supporting you if you're in charge I'm supporting you but I'm thinking I might I might do this

650
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.32
and then you watch what would my what would the results of my decision have been compared to what

651
01:10:48.32 --> 01:10:53.36
they did so you you can be thinking like a leader even though you might not necessarily be in a

652
01:10:53.36 --> 01:11:01.44
leadership position so live with that mindset that's what you need to do now as far as you

653
01:11:01.44 --> 01:11:07.44
passing up the opportunity to lead which yes you're admitting was an error first of all say this it

654
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:14.48
probably it's probably not quite as obvious to everyone else as it is to you in your mind you're thinking

655
01:11:14.48 --> 01:11:19.76
all man I blew it this was my chance and I bet the guys went back from that call and didn't even think about it

656
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:25.20
didn't even think about it again most likely unless it was just some playground I don't want to lead

657
01:11:25.20 --> 01:11:28.56
I'm ready if you did that well then yeah people go to the other but if you just said

658
01:11:28.56 --> 01:11:34.88
if you just kind of backed away from a moment people people might have realized it but anyways regardless

659
01:11:34.88 --> 01:11:38.08
of that you probably guess what I'm going to say then what you're going to do is I want it

660
01:11:38.88 --> 01:11:44.88
right you got to own it so when the opportunity presents itself to explain

661
01:11:45.92 --> 01:11:53.20
what happened and what went wrong and what you did wrong right not making excuses but explain

662
01:11:53.20 --> 01:12:00.32
where you were weak you know so you say hey guys you know hey remember that last call

663
01:12:01.20 --> 01:12:06.56
I should have stepped up and I had to have the wrong mindset I wasn't ready to lead and I let

664
01:12:06.56 --> 01:12:11.76
not only that let you guys down I let myself down and I'm not going to let that happen again from now on

665
01:12:12.64 --> 01:12:14.88
I'm going to have leadership in the front of my mind that's what I'm going to do

666
01:12:15.60 --> 01:12:20.000
I'm going to be thinking about what needs to get done I'm going to be thinking about contingencies

667
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.28
and how I'm going to lead and I promise the next time this opportunity comes up I'm going to be ready to lead

668
01:12:25.60 --> 01:12:32.80
so I'm sorry for letting you guys down and what happened again okay that's that's it boom

669
01:12:34.32 --> 01:12:42.56
get the mindset live and think as a leader regardless of what position you're actually in and then

670
01:12:42.56 --> 01:12:47.68
when they call you in the opportunity presents itself step up and lead

671
01:12:47.68 --> 01:12:59.04
obviously that's your default mindset now yes it seems obvious to me it is truly was it always

672
01:12:59.04 --> 01:13:04.16
like that even before that story that I've told over and over again about being on an oil rig and

673
01:13:04.16 --> 01:13:10.40
coming up and guys not know where to go or everything freezing and me going okay I'm just

674
01:13:10.40 --> 01:13:14.88
to step back and look around and make a call and when I did that that was it and so I I want to

675
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:20.96
click it clicked or I would say I guess I was thinking about it beforehand because I was you know

676
01:13:20.96 --> 01:13:24.24
observing my leaders and thinking about what they were doing and what I would do differently in a certain

677
01:13:24.24 --> 01:13:31.84
situation yeah yeah it's crazy because even in everyday life which is what I represent

678
01:13:31.84 --> 01:13:38.72
everyday life but you know how your life or girl whatever is like hey you know what's the dinner situation

679
01:13:38.72 --> 01:13:45.84
what do you want oh I don't care whenever you want you know that's a time where I always feel this

680
01:13:45.84 --> 01:13:52.48
what this guy just asked you know I mean obviously it's nothing compared to his situation but

681
01:13:53.04 --> 01:13:56.56
like hey what you know what do you think for dinner kind of thing and I'm like I don't I don't care

682
01:13:56.56 --> 01:14:00.88
and that's really how I feel I don't care I'm kind of down for whatever kind of thing but that's not why

683
01:14:02.16 --> 01:14:06.72
that's not why she's asking me she wants me she wants me to make the decision she wants me

684
01:14:06.72 --> 01:14:11.04
and it's step up and be like this what we're having for dinner I'm gonna go get her I'm gonna

685
01:14:11.04 --> 01:14:14.80
make it or whatever that's what she wants and really those little this those that situation

686
01:14:14.80 --> 01:14:18.64
comes up all the time that's a good point just like you know the old that the joe actually that's kind

687
01:14:18.64 --> 01:14:23.28
of like a joke you know when you ask a girl when it goes as or when you ask a girl hey when you

688
01:14:23.28 --> 01:14:26.80
want to eat and she says I don't I don't care whatever and then you say okay we're gonna go eat here

689
01:14:26.80 --> 01:14:33.92
and then I really like that of course see yeah you gotta yeah I feel like this guy when I do that

690
01:14:33.92 --> 01:14:37.28
that's the point so for now when you're gonna step up and leave I'm gonna do it yeah but I

691
01:14:37.28 --> 01:14:41.28
want it to be my default is why you know like yours is like your default like you know all this

692
01:14:41.28 --> 01:14:45.28
will do it yeah okay you know what I wish that was true with when it did come to dinner

693
01:14:45.84 --> 01:14:50.72
actually it's a lot of it kind of is true because I only go to like three places to eat yes

694
01:14:50.72 --> 01:14:58.16
and I go to one 80% of the time yeah so the other 20% of the time so if she says where you

695
01:14:58.16 --> 01:15:02.48
want to go I'm gonna say that my restaurant yeah we're gonna raglands and I'll be too

696
01:15:02.48 --> 01:15:07.52
far here but that makes it harder the right way that she like raglands though she does she does

697
01:15:07.52 --> 01:15:13.84
which makes it easier yeah but and if she doesn't feel like it then she'll be like I don't

698
01:15:13.84 --> 01:15:19.76
really want to go there okay cool now it's on you I gave you my vote right now you don't want to do that

699
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:24.96
but I think you still gotta do it you still gotta make the decision you gotta like because in

700
01:15:24.96 --> 01:15:30.08
a way I'm in the same boat as your second scenario there like if she's out of there so

701
01:15:30.08 --> 01:15:33.44
I'm gonna do that I'm just gonna name my secondary restaurant all right there you go

702
01:15:33.44 --> 01:15:38.16
maybe she'll say yes maybe she'll say no well that gotta be my default now though

703
01:15:40.40 --> 01:15:44.64
step up the lead you know what I you know what I gotta do I gotta prepare I gotta prepare myself

704
01:15:44.64 --> 01:15:49.68
will yeah I gotta have like five options just ready to go on deck that's what I have three

705
01:15:51.12 --> 01:15:54.24
so that's not what you want to do and they all come to the same order

706
01:15:54.24 --> 01:16:01.84
I must be really boring hey you focus on what's important that's good well whenever my wife says

707
01:16:01.84 --> 01:16:07.04
uh you know tell you everyone want to try anything new I said nope yeah I don't I don't yeah

708
01:16:07.04 --> 01:16:14.48
speaking of which darling you're my girl not looking at something new I'm at the same thing very

709
01:16:14.48 --> 01:16:20.80
happy yes that's actually that I'm gonna use that one there but what do you do when the team wants

710
01:16:20.80 --> 01:16:28.40
to try something new all right let's do that all right good tips all right next question

711
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:34.40
jockel i'm a sergeant in my country's army the reason that i'm sending you this message is

712
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:39.84
because of a tragic incident in our unit this week a young enlisted soldier committed suicide

713
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:45.76
he shot himself with his issue rifle this came as a shock to all of us he was a bright

714
01:16:45.76 --> 01:16:52.32
smart and happy guy damn i'm seeking your advice jockel do you have any advice on how I as a leader

715
01:16:52.32 --> 01:16:59.36
can talk to the guys about it how does a group of soldier soldiers cope with a loss when the reason

716
01:16:59.36 --> 01:17:13.52
is so tragic thank you and and obviously condolences to the team the and the family of the soldier

717
01:17:13.52 --> 01:17:18.72
and i think what you have to do in this situation is you got to as a leader you got to bring

718
01:17:18.72 --> 01:17:23.04
me out in the open i think one of the worst things you can do is pretend that it didn't happen

719
01:17:23.04 --> 01:17:28.40
pretend that the problem's gonna go away and i think what you have to do is you have to explain it

720
01:17:28.40 --> 01:17:34.08
which is weird because in this case explaining it means admitting that you can't explain it

721
01:17:34.96 --> 01:17:39.28
because you can't explain it or you're not gonna be able to you're gonna be making up

722
01:17:39.28 --> 01:17:45.12
something that you're guessing at right you're not gonna know what individual what individual

723
01:17:45.92 --> 01:17:51.92
situations caused this to happen you know because who can make sense of that i mean a bright

724
01:17:53.28 --> 01:18:04.64
smart happy guy it doesn't make sense and and and won't you can't explain why you i think you

725
01:18:04.64 --> 01:18:11.68
have to address it as a reality and i think you got to address it as something that your

726
01:18:11.68 --> 01:18:15.76
pulltune needs to fight against just like they would fight against the enemy

727
01:18:17.36 --> 01:18:23.12
well what is the threat the threat is depression the threat is loneliness the threat is helplessness

728
01:18:23.12 --> 01:18:32.24
the threat is feeling like there's no way out and being aware of those threats

729
01:18:32.24 --> 01:18:43.20
is what allows recognition of the enemy so that you can fight them so i think you got to talk

730
01:18:43.20 --> 01:18:48.000
about this with your guys i think that they will become aware of what they need to look

731
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:57.84
out for in others and in themselves so they can alert the platoon that you know joy if you

732
01:18:57.84 --> 01:19:02.56
guys talk to johnny man he seems you know johnny seems a little off right now we should check in on him

733
01:19:02.56 --> 01:19:09.60
we should talk to him or self recognition man i'm feeling like depressed about something i'm feeling

734
01:19:09.60 --> 01:19:15.68
dark it doesn't i don't know what i'm gonna do right and on that last podcast that we did

735
01:19:17.12 --> 01:19:23.84
i read a couple excerpts in words from some various combat veterans

736
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:31.52
and i touched on the fact that several of them from different times from different wars had

737
01:19:31.52 --> 01:19:41.04
written the same thing and they wrote basically that death would be liberating and that it would

738
01:19:41.04 --> 01:19:47.76
be an escape from the hell of war from the memories of war and and i should have hit on that

739
01:19:47.76 --> 01:19:59.28
harger because i i think that what that means to me what that tells me is that

740
01:20:01.44 --> 01:20:08.56
is that having those thoughts doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong with you

741
01:20:08.56 --> 01:20:15.36
right it doesn't necessarily mean that you're losing it these you know the the writings that

742
01:20:15.36 --> 01:20:20.80
i'm talking about the book and the writing from a guy that i knew doesn't mean that you're losing it

743
01:20:22.08 --> 01:20:27.92
and i think that people think to themselves oh i'm i'm thinking about how death would be an

744
01:20:27.92 --> 01:20:34.16
easier way right now and and and they think that by thinking that they're they're totally screwed up

745
01:20:35.52 --> 01:20:42.48
when i think the realities that is or i'm in think the reality of the situation is that that's

746
01:20:42.48 --> 01:20:53.52
obviously a fairly normal thing to think about and you know i i when i was in Ramani

747
01:20:53.52 --> 01:21:01.84
i i definitely i i wasn't thinking about killing us but i definitely saw that dying in combat

748
01:21:02.64 --> 01:21:08.08
was would be a relief to the stress that i was under no doubt and and i didn't want to die but i'll

749
01:21:08.08 --> 01:21:14.08
say what we joked about it i joked about it with life i'd be like if we get a firefight tonight

750
01:21:14.08 --> 01:21:17.92
first thing to do is crack a green cameland on my chest so the enemy knows exactly where i'm

751
01:21:17.92 --> 01:21:26.32
like we're joking because we're under a lot of stress but i think my what i'm trying to say is that

752
01:21:26.32 --> 01:21:31.60
those feelings or those thoughts don't mean that you're done they just mean that you're human

753
01:21:31.60 --> 01:21:37.44
um they just mean that you're human and i think if you keep them bottled up

754
01:21:38.80 --> 01:21:44.24
then they might explode so that's what i think you need to do i thought so i need to tell

755
01:21:44.24 --> 01:21:51.76
your men that these thoughts happen and that your platoon your team needs to be on guard against them

756
01:21:53.20 --> 01:21:59.44
and the best way to be on guard is to be vigilant to look for the signs to look for behavior

757
01:21:59.44 --> 01:22:04.88
and talk about them and then be able to ask for help it's one of the big problems

758
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:11.28
guys i want to ask for help because we're macho i don't need help with anything we are egos

759
01:22:11.28 --> 01:22:19.92
are too big so we don't ask for help and so we have to put our egos in check we got to pay attention

760
01:22:19.92 --> 01:22:24.48
to each other and there's going to be some people that you're going to have to pry this out of them

761
01:22:24.48 --> 01:22:29.92
right they're not going to willingly talk about it so i think that's what you have to do so that you

762
01:22:29.92 --> 01:22:35.84
can get somebody some professional help i'm not a psychiatrist obviously and and in a normal

763
01:22:35.84 --> 01:22:40.72
infantry platoon there's no psychiatrist in there but you need to recognize because you're the

764
01:22:40.72 --> 01:22:45.92
first line of defense and how can you get that somebody to a professional that can help them

765
01:22:47.76 --> 01:22:51.84
and to be honest this doesn't only apply to soldiers right it applies to everyone

766
01:22:51.84 --> 01:22:59.52
don't let these thoughts fester in your brain you got to get them out you got to put them out

767
01:22:59.52 --> 01:23:07.20
the light right you got to put them out the light so they so they dry they're like a vampire

768
01:23:07.20 --> 01:23:14.48
they dry up and they whither and they they turned to dust you know that's what you want to

769
01:23:14.48 --> 01:23:17.76
your exposums you can get the professional help and get things under control so

770
01:23:17.76 --> 01:23:24.08
that's the leadership be straightforward with your troops tell them the truth explained the

771
01:23:24.08 --> 01:23:29.28
enemy threat that's what we're talking about and how you as a platoon are going to look out for it

772
01:23:31.84 --> 01:23:38.08
and then obviously you got to grieve the loss you got to mourn your fallen comrades and then

773
01:23:38.08 --> 01:23:46.72
you also have to get back to work get back to soldiering get back to preparing

774
01:23:46.72 --> 01:23:54.88
for the enemy that you will face on the battlefield with with a new awareness that there's a

775
01:23:54.88 --> 01:24:05.12
another enemy that can lurk inside lupiltoon and inside the individual and that you have to protect

776
01:24:05.12 --> 01:24:10.08
each other just like you protect each other from a real enemy so that would probably be the

777
01:24:10.08 --> 01:24:16.80
route that I would go good luck brother with that sis uh it's a hard one for sure

778
01:24:19.60 --> 01:24:27.84
next question juggle my leader is not an extreme ownership disciple among other things he's

779
01:24:27.84 --> 01:24:34.40
fostering division within our team how do I help lead those who no longer trust in the commander

780
01:24:34.40 --> 01:24:41.20
but are awesome guys who want to stay involved how do I bring them back into the fold without

781
01:24:41.20 --> 01:24:48.56
threatening our lead or our dear leader all right well first of all you got to become a buffer

782
01:24:48.56 --> 01:24:54.56
between your boss and your team that's what you need to do um trying to absorb as much

783
01:24:54.56 --> 01:25:01.12
negativity as you can and make sure you don't spread that negativity right this and also this is a

784
01:25:01.12 --> 01:25:05.60
delicate situation that we've talked about before if you completely support the boss

785
01:25:07.60 --> 01:25:11.84
and and and act like the boss is the greatest person in the world the team is going to reject you

786
01:25:11.84 --> 01:25:17.12
or there's a like a high likelihood that they're going to reject you at the same time if you completely

787
01:25:17.12 --> 01:25:24.24
reject the boss then you've actually aided in dividing the team because now the team is not

788
01:25:24.24 --> 01:25:29.52
aligned with the boss so you have to balance you have to balance us in one of the best ways to do this

789
01:25:29.52 --> 01:25:36.88
is to put listen that's you got to put the importance of the mission and the team above the

790
01:25:36.88 --> 01:25:45.04
ego's an attitude so here's I'm gonna say something like look guys look guys I know we have

791
01:25:45.60 --> 01:25:49.92
our differences with the chain of command on some things but we have a job to do all right we have

792
01:25:49.92 --> 01:25:55.52
a mission to accomplish and even though we might not agree with the boss on everything it's our team

793
01:25:55.52 --> 01:26:04.56
it's our team and the performance of the team sure it reflects the boss but it reflects us too

794
01:26:07.12 --> 01:26:16.80
so what I say we do is win let's let's win let's be the best regardless of what the boss does

795
01:26:16.80 --> 01:26:27.76
oh what the boss says let's win to prove to prove that even with a situation where the leadership

796
01:26:27.76 --> 01:26:36.88
might be lacking a bit we're so good that we're gonna win anyways who wants to get some of that right

797
01:26:37.84 --> 01:26:42.24
there you go let's win despite poor leadership that's what we're gonna do any and I'll tell you

798
01:26:42.24 --> 01:26:52.64
what in my younger and maybe a little less politically savvy days I want to say something like let's win

799
01:26:53.68 --> 01:27:00.64
not just despite our leadership but let's win two spite our leadership like we would just perform

800
01:27:00.64 --> 01:27:07.20
so well in the face of a horrible leader we're gonna show everyone what was up the underdog

801
01:27:07.20 --> 01:27:12.72
Cinderella story we're gonna rock so that's cool you know sometimes you're you're winning

802
01:27:13.68 --> 01:27:17.76
not just despite your leadership but two spite them I'm done that a couple times in the

803
01:27:17.76 --> 01:27:23.20
career not not the better not the best one it's better to win despite them so despite we

804
01:27:23.20 --> 01:27:28.72
we got some rough leadership it's okay and the other thing is you know even when you're doing that

805
01:27:28.72 --> 01:27:34.000
with a bad leader you still got to be careful that step in the leaders toes and the way you do that

806
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.68
is really easy you give them all the credit you give them all the credit and that's great and that

807
01:27:37.68 --> 01:27:42.40
little nagging voice that you got in the back your head that wants credit you know that one I'm talking

808
01:27:42.40 --> 01:27:47.92
about that you go back there don't worry about that I'm telling you right now you will get the

809
01:27:47.92 --> 01:27:54.64
credit in the long run you will get the credit don't worry about it you might not get the credit on

810
01:27:54.64 --> 01:28:02.08
this one or even this week this month maybe not even this year but eventually you will get the credit

811
01:28:02.08 --> 01:28:11.68
and recognition that you deserve that you want because your boss's boss he knows what's up he knows what's

812
01:28:11.68 --> 01:28:19.44
up and your troops know what's up and so when everybody knows what's up when you have a truly

813
01:28:19.44 --> 01:28:25.60
bad leader the truly bad leader doesn't they're not they're not just walking around fooling everyone

814
01:28:25.60 --> 01:28:31.20
in an organization it's not happening it's not happening and if it does happen it doesn't happen

815
01:28:31.20 --> 01:28:38.08
for long it only happens there's a limited time that it can happen for because every every

816
01:28:38.08 --> 01:28:44.08
idiotic move that that leader makes down the chain of command at least one out of every five

817
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:48.48
he does some stupid up the chain of command too and so how is that group performance so well

818
01:28:49.04 --> 01:28:53.92
we know it's not the leader he's an idiot oh they must have some good junior leadership in

819
01:28:53.92 --> 01:28:58.80
there who's those guys oh that's echo Charles these and charge that squat and they're crushing it

820
01:28:58.80 --> 01:29:05.52
so don't worry about that just lead and win and give that credit away and it's gonna come back

821
01:29:05.52 --> 01:29:12.40
to you tenfold that's what you do kind of in a way goes back to like people are watching

822
01:29:12.40 --> 01:29:16.000
they're watching yeah he's a poor leader he's a poor leader people are gonna pick up on that

823
01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.72
yeah and they're not gonna you know that doesn't mean that the boss's boss is gonna advertise that

824
01:29:20.72 --> 01:29:25.20
because the boss's boss they're a good leader so the boss's boss is gonna come and undermine them

825
01:29:25.20 --> 01:29:29.84
yeah no but when the time comes for emotion when the time comes for a reorganization

826
01:29:30.56 --> 01:29:34.80
that's gonna be happening you know that's where that that's really just means are gonna be made yeah

827
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:44.72
but we get so wrapped up we get the ego gets you yeah ego gets you yeah kind of watch out for that thing

828
01:29:46.24 --> 01:29:52.16
yeah to truly let it go when you don't get the credit and you for real think that you deserve the credit

829
01:29:52.16 --> 01:29:55.20
the truly let it go there's the challenge yeah that's a challenging one

830
01:29:56.88 --> 01:30:03.36
relish in that challenge laugh at it yeah you know good boss you did awesome good job

831
01:30:03.92 --> 01:30:09.28
yeah because I feel like anyway when that does happen you know and so and it's not even

832
01:30:09.28 --> 01:30:14.32
necessarily someone else gets the credit for what you did it's just that like something big happen and

833
01:30:15.36 --> 01:30:20.80
it just went completely unnoticed that that it was straight up because of you right that's a

834
01:30:20.80 --> 01:30:26.32
potential scenario but let's say you don't you don't say anything I think that there is a small

835
01:30:26.32 --> 01:30:31.28
feeling of satisfaction that you're like you know you took the hero in the same I you know

836
01:30:31.28 --> 01:30:35.84
completely get that feeling maybe that's my ego yeah let me look at me over here I'm not even saying

837
01:30:35.84 --> 01:30:40.000
anything I'm giving away so much credit I'm the man that's like the perfect amount of ego

838
01:30:40.72 --> 01:30:47.60
or perfectly directed ego but because usually it's a clip by the fact that you didn't get your credit

839
01:30:47.60 --> 01:30:52.80
yeah usually yeah yeah for sure that's hard I want the credit got to work on that

840
01:30:54.48 --> 01:31:01.68
check next question I have a question about the warrior mentality I recently was dumped on a

841
01:31:01.68 --> 01:31:08.32
deployment and it's difficult now that I'm home state site how does a warrior handle this is it like

842
01:31:08.32 --> 01:31:13.28
any other emotional loss I'm trying to use this loss and get after it and improve myself mentally

843
01:31:13.28 --> 01:31:20.72
and physically not sure how to properly submit questions to the podcast all right so the deer

844
01:31:20.72 --> 01:31:26.88
John letter the old classic deer John letter and so you know agree sometimes you can keep it

845
01:31:26.88 --> 01:31:31.44
bay when you're deployed but then when you get home and you get back to the places the familiar

846
01:31:31.44 --> 01:31:39.52
places where you have the specific memories that's that's where the pain start to come in

847
01:31:39.52 --> 01:31:47.68
and that's fine you know that's that hurts that's we get that but in my opinion I've said this

848
01:31:47.68 --> 01:31:54.48
before the person that you built in your mind the person that you had relationship with that you built

849
01:31:54.48 --> 01:32:04.96
in your mind that person doesn't actually exist they're not real they're not real she wasn't who she

850
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:12.40
appeared to be and she isn't who she appeared to be she isn't the sweet understanding fun person

851
01:32:12.40 --> 01:32:17.92
that you cared so much about that's not her that's your memory that's what you built in your head

852
01:32:17.92 --> 01:32:24.000
she is actually the self-self centered person that cares about herself first and doesn't care

853
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:32.16
about you that's the reality and that's fine but a lot of times the pain that we feel isn't

854
01:32:32.16 --> 01:32:38.88
based on the reality it's based on the fantasy so you're feeling pain of losing something that wasn't

855
01:32:38.88 --> 01:32:48.16
real so let the fantasy go remember that she is not the perfect person that you built in your mind

856
01:32:48.16 --> 01:32:58.32
period she's not otherwise we wouldn't be in this situation right now and then move on brother

857
01:32:58.32 --> 01:33:07.12
get after it work out train hard go to the kitchen to hike run a blanket hard just get after it

858
01:33:07.12 --> 01:33:12.88
and those things not only are you going to distract you from the pain which is good they're going

859
01:33:12.88 --> 01:33:16.80
to improve you as a human being which is good and they're going to rebuild your confidence which is

860
01:33:16.80 --> 01:33:22.80
good they're going to make you feel good they're going to make you stronger and smarter and better

861
01:33:22.80 --> 01:33:31.60
and put you into a place where you don't need that little made up fantasy anymore and they're

862
01:33:31.60 --> 01:33:35.68
going to put you into place where you're going to find something better than the fantasy now i'm

863
01:33:35.68 --> 01:33:45.12
going to tell you right now the fantasies don't exist the perfect girl or guy for you doesn't exist

864
01:33:45.12 --> 01:33:53.92
they don't exist so you're going to be out looking for someone that's good but you're not going

865
01:33:53.92 --> 01:33:58.24
to find perfect don't get obsessed with finding perfect if you find someone that's perfect it's

866
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:08.40
it's not true everyone's got their flaws so that's what you have to do and you will end up

867
01:34:08.40 --> 01:34:18.80
finding someone that's real and I get it man I know you're going to have some moments down in the

868
01:34:18.80 --> 01:34:27.36
hole as Alice and chains put it or trapped in the heart shaped box as Nirvana put it

869
01:34:29.20 --> 01:34:35.60
or so lonesome you could cry as Hank Williams senior put it is that you notice a theme here

870
01:34:35.60 --> 01:34:44.56
this is what people go through but those feelings their temporary so let them say hi

871
01:34:45.52 --> 01:34:49.76
let them hang around for a minute or for half an hour an hour or whatever and then kick them out

872
01:34:50.40 --> 01:34:56.64
kick those feelings out get them out of there and go do something else take your mind away from

873
01:34:56.64 --> 01:35:03.52
those memories of fantasies and put build some good memories that are real and yeah you know what

874
01:35:03.52 --> 01:35:10.48
you can use your anger and your frustration to fuel positivity for sure I spent much of my youth doing

875
01:35:10.48 --> 01:35:21.92
that very thing for sure all those breakups yeah I turn those things into fuel and the other

876
01:35:21.92 --> 01:35:26.48
thing I'm telling you is if you take actually your body your mind's going to fall and pretty soon

877
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:34.32
you'll be on to the next chapter and you can move beyond this bad fantasy chapter that you

878
01:35:34.32 --> 01:35:43.28
kind of got roped into. I can get you every time if you let them. It's so hard to

879
01:35:43.28 --> 01:35:49.04
end with so many times you know because when I was a system to a commander a two-in-commander

880
01:35:49.04 --> 01:35:54.96
task commander what I was doing right but more in the earlier phases right because once I was

881
01:35:54.96 --> 01:35:58.88
you know a task you're a commander I was dealing with a lot less those those problems that would

882
01:35:58.88 --> 01:36:05.92
come to me on a relationship level would be something big you know divorce custody of children

883
01:36:05.92 --> 01:36:09.92
some kind of domestic violent scenario like real things but when I was younger

884
01:36:11.44 --> 01:36:15.84
and I was in a seal platoon that's when you're dealing with guys going through the breakup with the

885
01:36:15.84 --> 01:36:21.68
girl and that you know the method with my head man yeah it's messing with my head man yeah of course

886
01:36:21.68 --> 01:36:27.68
every guy goes through that me you ever that's the way it is you get that weird thing

887
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:35.68
kicking around in there and you start getting crazy and what's so fun is what's so funny is

888
01:36:35.68 --> 01:36:40.48
when you're on the outside of it it's so like when you're in the heart shaped box to yourself

889
01:36:40.48 --> 01:36:44.88
you just can't see anything else it's just devastating and everyone that's looking at you is like

890
01:36:44.88 --> 01:36:50.08
bro let's just go to the bargainite you've meet 17 new girls tonight yeah but I've like a back

891
01:36:50.08 --> 01:36:55.28
guy like that was my girl that was my special girl no it's not I remember I kind of had a this

892
01:36:55.28 --> 01:37:01.36
is kind of evil but I had a kind of a standard response to guys when they'd say you know

893
01:37:03.44 --> 01:37:09.04
hey you know I broke up with Jennifer last night I mean oh sweet man let's let's roll I would always

894
01:37:09.04 --> 01:37:13.04
and I even carried that honestly this is like not something I don't think I would do anymore but

895
01:37:13.04 --> 01:37:17.84
even when guys who would be like hey man me and Jennifer are getting divorced a bit oh right

896
01:37:17.84 --> 01:37:22.48
oh bro you're asking that's rockin' roll you know I kind of and part of it was just to kind of

897
01:37:22.48 --> 01:37:29.76
spin it like guys man it's not that you need you don't just wallowing it right you're getting divorced

898
01:37:29.76 --> 01:37:33.68
okay here's what you need to do here's how you maneuver but you know what are you going to do

899
01:37:33.68 --> 01:37:38.96
you're going to get dragged down by that into that mire or you're going to you know salvage

900
01:37:38.96 --> 01:37:45.92
what you can of your life and let's move on let's rock and roll yeah so that's again it might be a

901
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:49.60
little harsh I don't know that would still have that react maybe with maybe false still in the

902
01:37:49.60 --> 01:37:58.96
dude you know and most and 99 I had one guy that that that in I probably said that to

903
01:37:59.68 --> 01:38:04.64
we have a height of horse rate in the sealed teams yeah it's like an 85 90% of horse rate so I've

904
01:38:04.64 --> 01:38:10.72
said this too quite a few individuals over there I only had one that ever kind of you know was

905
01:38:10.72 --> 01:38:18.56
was like no man you don't get it I said no actually I do get it you don't get it yeah and it always

906
01:38:18.56 --> 01:38:23.60
is a little rough ruiners kids involved in all that so that would put another little horrible

907
01:38:23.60 --> 01:38:30.24
spin on it but the bottom line is that is a good attitude to have hey broke up with my girl

908
01:38:30.24 --> 01:38:36.64
right on I'm glad I got out of this relationship before it developed into something where I did

909
01:38:36.64 --> 01:38:44.64
have hooks in me yeah financial hooks children yeah all those things I made it out scop free

910
01:38:44.64 --> 01:38:50.88
you know I'm getting divorced oh you have any kids no okay rock and roll yeah you got kids okay

911
01:38:50.88 --> 01:38:56.56
well how's it gonna go you know what do you put in line yeah you know I'm so yeah definitely hard

912
01:38:57.44 --> 01:39:04.72
here's the question have you ever gotten your heart broken the negative you haven't straight up

913
01:39:04.72 --> 01:39:10.24
even in of course I have broke I was I was a boy boys get their heart broken when went tell me

914
01:39:10.24 --> 01:39:20.80
oh 10 11 yeah that I'm talking like no I'm 21 ish time because you know when you're 10 it's like

915
01:39:21.36 --> 01:39:28.56
okay 15 14 17 13 I mean I think once I was I was I see once I was in the sealed teams I kind of

916
01:39:28.56 --> 01:39:36.48
had that coping mechanism yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

917
01:39:36.48 --> 01:39:43.92
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but yeah the y'all that's you know the younger days for sure

918
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:48.24
every guy goes through that and that's what that's what's hard and you know what I'm saying guys

919
01:39:48.24 --> 01:39:54.16
specifically but the girls are the same way both guys and girls go through these horrible breakups

920
01:39:54.16 --> 01:39:59.92
when you and and this is the other thing that we got to realize as parents when you're 16 years old

921
01:40:01.04 --> 01:40:08.80
we you know I look at my 15 16 17 year old daughters right as they were grown up and and I think oh they

922
01:40:08.80 --> 01:40:17.76
got a boyfriend whatever he'll be it's this guy is meaningless in their lives I factually know

923
01:40:17.76 --> 01:40:24.80
that these guys are meaningless in terms of the broad spectrum of their life yeah but guess what when

924
01:40:24.80 --> 01:40:30.80
you're 15 years old and you got a boyfriend that is your whole life and so when something goes sideways

925
01:40:31.36 --> 01:40:36.56
I had to say oh I'd remember that myself when I saw my daughters distraught over something I'd

926
01:40:36.56 --> 01:40:40.88
say okay here's what's going on this is her whole life and I tried to explain to him this

927
01:40:40.88 --> 01:40:47.60
guy I understand that you like him and that he was good and blah blah blah but you know let's

928
01:40:47.60 --> 01:40:53.68
remember you're only 15 and there you know you're gonna meet another nice guy and other there'll be

929
01:40:53.68 --> 01:40:58.40
other opportunities and blah blah blah but of course barely barely gets through to their heads

930
01:40:58.40 --> 01:41:03.52
yeah hopefully they can't even imagine a nicer guy is different I know because he's the

931
01:41:03.52 --> 01:41:14.000
bad no and so yeah yeah you're on that question restriction from now on no I'm not

932
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:23.36
ready to know I think we all want it to know next question juggle what's your take on false

933
01:41:23.36 --> 01:41:32.48
motivation versus authentic leadership okay false motivation versus authentic leadership

934
01:41:32.48 --> 01:41:39.12
and others two kind of two kind of ways of understanding this question the first is from like

935
01:41:39.12 --> 01:41:44.40
a really heavy leadership perspective and that is of trying to lead without actually believing

936
01:41:44.40 --> 01:41:51.84
in what you're doing and that's leading without understanding why and not believing in what you're

937
01:41:51.84 --> 01:41:57.04
doing and that's wrong right and this is an extreme ownership of course and we talk about

938
01:41:57.04 --> 01:42:01.28
on the podcast you can't do it if you don't believe in what you're doing your team is going to

939
01:42:01.28 --> 01:42:04.80
see that and they won't believe in it either which means they're not going to go above and

940
01:42:04.80 --> 01:42:09.68
beyond to accomplish the mission period so you got to believe what you're doing and if you don't

941
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:15.28
believe it then you got to ask the question up the chain of command find out why understand why

942
01:42:15.28 --> 01:42:19.20
so you believe in what you're doing and eventually you're going to get the answer right

943
01:42:19.20 --> 01:42:25.36
eventually you're going to understand why you're doing something you're going to believe in it

944
01:42:25.36 --> 01:42:30.80
or you're going to you're going to convince the chain of command that that's not a good method

945
01:42:30.80 --> 01:42:38.72
then you need to go a different direction and there might be some rare in extremist case where

946
01:42:38.72 --> 01:42:42.32
you actually don't you know you're I'm being told to do something I don't believe in it

947
01:42:43.92 --> 01:42:49.52
and I'd say no I'm not going to do it in like Napoleon said Napoleon's maximums if you

948
01:42:49.52 --> 01:42:54.16
you you actually have to refuse to do it if you don't believe it's the right thing to do then you

949
01:42:54.16 --> 01:43:00.40
don't do it that should be if very in extremist because or as a leader when we're being

950
01:43:00.40 --> 01:43:07.52
asked to do something or told to do something or led in a certain way they're leading us towards

951
01:43:07.52 --> 01:43:13.04
victory right they're leading us towards an aligned victory if it's on the battlefield

952
01:43:13.04 --> 01:43:17.84
that's winning the war if it's in business it's creating profit and creating a product and

953
01:43:18.88 --> 01:43:24.40
growing the business right those things are that's what you're trying to do so if echo if

954
01:43:24.40 --> 01:43:28.64
I'm the boss and you come to me with something and say hey I want to do this

955
01:43:28.64 --> 01:43:34.32
if it's going to make us more profitable why would I say no right so we're going to move in that

956
01:43:34.32 --> 01:43:40.56
direction so from a high level false motivation doesn't work if you don't believe in something

957
01:43:40.56 --> 01:43:49.12
it's not going to work out for you now from a micro level from like a front line level and the

958
01:43:49.12 --> 01:43:53.68
buds and structures used to joke about this that false motivation is better than no motivation

959
01:43:53.68 --> 01:43:57.44
have you heard that is that a common expression false motivation is better than no motivation

960
01:43:57.44 --> 01:44:05.60
and we don't want that to be true right because we want motivation to be this pure golden thing

961
01:44:05.60 --> 01:44:10.48
that fuels performance but the fact the matter is and of course we talk about all this all the

962
01:44:10.48 --> 01:44:17.28
time motivation doesn't hold up right motivation doesn't how many motivated people motivated people

963
01:44:18.72 --> 01:44:23.92
motivated people didn't make it through seal training a ton of them they're all motivated

964
01:44:23.92 --> 01:44:29.76
you how many of them did it make you training a ton how many motivated people do you see

965
01:44:30.88 --> 01:44:36.32
that don't accomplish their goals that they have right the world is full full of those people

966
01:44:36.32 --> 01:44:42.32
there's a ton of those people and that's because motivation doesn't hold you up we all know this it's

967
01:44:42.32 --> 01:44:48.88
discipline that holds you up it's discipline that gets things going and it's discipline that gets you

968
01:44:48.88 --> 01:44:56.64
through things but this is an interesting little spin if you have the discipline to press on

969
01:44:57.36 --> 01:45:02.24
why don't have a little fun with it right and that's what I think false motivation can

970
01:45:02.24 --> 01:45:08.80
can come in and it can make something fun for instance it's cold wet and miserable and we have to

971
01:45:08.80 --> 01:45:17.76
go swim over the beach and do an operation let's get some or it's 118 degrees with massive

972
01:45:17.76 --> 01:45:26.40
humidity and we have a 14 kilometer patrol to get to target let's get some right do yeah

973
01:45:27.36 --> 01:45:37.20
or the water is 41 degrees and we air about to launch on a four hour dive right hell yes let's do this

974
01:45:37.20 --> 01:45:44.64
right that that's false motivation but it's backed up by discipline and it might not be real but

975
01:45:44.64 --> 01:45:51.76
it absolutely beats the hell out of this is could be miserable that I want to do it right what would

976
01:45:51.76 --> 01:45:56.56
you if you and I were going to go do something that was going to suck would you rather have me say

977
01:45:57.28 --> 01:46:01.68
echo I really don't want to do this but I'm disciplined to him going to do it oh would you have

978
01:46:01.68 --> 01:46:07.68
rather have me say echo this is going to suck let's go get some right you rather have the false

979
01:46:07.68 --> 01:46:13.04
motivation yes sir strap on the pack and put on the mask and fins and fire up the false

980
01:46:13.04 --> 01:46:20.48
motivation now I will tell you this I wouldn't even be sarcastic with false motivation I won't

981
01:46:20.48 --> 01:46:24.96
even blink and I actually my this is the difference my my false motivation isn't even false I

982
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:30.80
actually believe my own false motivation yeah it's working and by the time stuff came out of my

983
01:46:30.80 --> 01:46:38.32
mouth I meant it I meant it so I don't know at some point in my childhood false motivation

984
01:46:38.32 --> 01:46:44.08
turned into like an actual fuel and just just regular motivation maybe it's because I realized

985
01:46:44.08 --> 01:46:49.04
that I wasn't counting on it to get me through things I was just having fun with it rock and roll

986
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.84
do you think also how you know how you like you'd always say that you're kind of into just

987
01:46:55.84 --> 01:47:02.64
being hardcore even if like normal stuff whatever so you know when you think back and you're like okay

988
01:47:02.64 --> 01:47:07.20
I'm going to take the hard route or whatever after you finish it you kind of feel more proud of it

989
01:47:07.20 --> 01:47:12.32
first like do you think that that played into it yeah that is like like a me yeah for sure

990
01:47:12.32 --> 01:47:17.76
for sure be more hardcore yeah like like I said like the meaning of the meaning of the music hard

991
01:47:17.76 --> 01:47:23.44
core when I was a kid was being hardcore yeah just the actual meaning of the word and so yeah it's

992
01:47:23.44 --> 01:47:27.04
really easy to go from that to like hey I'm going to do something that sucks and I'm going to have

993
01:47:27.04 --> 01:47:31.76
a good time with I'm going to laugh about it yeah and that and it is contagious you know so

994
01:47:31.76 --> 01:47:37.36
contagious I'm actually not like that now and if we're just saying you're going to like that I'm actually

995
01:47:37.36 --> 01:47:44.72
like that now okay not to you know 100% but in a lot of things man like my um my daughter she's

996
01:47:44.72 --> 01:47:53.60
four she weighs 45 47 pounds so I'll be sitting or I'll be laying on the couch not paying

997
01:47:53.60 --> 01:47:58.72
attention she'll climb up on the couch behind and jump in land like you know what a knee drop is right

998
01:47:58.72 --> 01:48:04.80
yeah atomic knee drop yeah for a while just so you know for a while in my house there was no rules

999
01:48:04.80 --> 01:48:10.000
in my house no actually there was no there was only two rules in my house when my kids were like

1000
01:48:10.72 --> 01:48:16.80
when my older kids were like you know seven six whatever that those types of ages that your

1001
01:48:16.80 --> 01:48:21.28
daughters out right now but a little bit older there was two rules in my house number one don't touch

1002
01:48:21.28 --> 01:48:29.76
me when I'm eating number two no atomic knee drops they would do it to each other oh yeah I

1003
01:48:29.76 --> 01:48:33.84
didn't mind them doing it to me but they would atomic knee drop each other yeah so I had to have two

1004
01:48:33.84 --> 01:48:39.20
rules and plus I would never a lot of time to eat and all of a sudden it's like they want to hold

1005
01:48:39.20 --> 01:48:45.76
on my arm no no no no no you're wasting you when I'm eating like a rabbit dog and it's funny one

1006
01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:50.16
of them the reason that's fresh in my mind because we were just on a trip and you know my

1007
01:48:50.16 --> 01:48:55.60
kids were explaining to my youngest daughter that well you know when we were little dad was

1008
01:48:55.60 --> 01:49:03.12
meaner and he wouldn't let us touch him when he was eating like you just did and of course I said well

1009
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:13.36
that's because she's cute or than you are all of you I don't mind the atomic knee drops anymore

1010
01:49:13.36 --> 01:49:17.36
because of you because of the various things like you got to be hardcore it's because of like

1011
01:49:17.36 --> 01:49:21.04
okay you got four year old kid yeah right so I think I have fun that is for her to

1012
01:49:21.04 --> 01:49:25.36
I talk to you drop you yeah which is the other reason why I'm like this now so she'll

1013
01:49:25.36 --> 01:49:29.52
climb on the couch atomic knee drop while I'm not ready by the way yeah my to my ribs so

1014
01:49:30.24 --> 01:49:36.96
she didn't break my ribs she didn't injure me to any blasting degree but if the normal

1015
01:49:36.96 --> 01:49:43.92
mindset is like why did you jump what did you do that it hurt yeah it's face it 45 47 pounds

1016
01:49:43.92 --> 01:49:49.12
top of a couch atomic knee drop both knees by the way all the way you know the last city all that stuff

1017
01:49:50.32 --> 01:49:56.96
hurt by the normal standard of things so the typical mindset I think would be like

1018
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:02.96
don't do that especially the shock and all this stuff but default is just like whatever you

1019
01:50:02.96 --> 01:50:08.08
factor yeah yeah yeah sure it is a catch-to-one too because she will and does and but she thinks

1020
01:50:08.08 --> 01:50:12.24
it's all fun and all this stuff but yeah that's that mindset and that you came directly from you

1021
01:50:12.24 --> 01:50:16.24
like be like it's like juggle wouldn't complain about that right there oh you won't let that happen

1022
01:50:16.24 --> 01:50:20.24
yeah it's really embarrassing if you complain to your four year old dog you hurt about anything you

1023
01:50:20.24 --> 01:50:24.56
hurt about anything yeah about anything yeah about anything that's that's that's the setting example

1024
01:50:24.56 --> 01:50:30.88
you're talking about earlier yeah you complain about anything and you're wrong agree that's so just suck it

1025
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:38.72
up yeah say bring it on false motivation which becomes real motivation which for the only the like I

1026
01:50:38.72 --> 01:50:46.80
said the only sort of reason for motivation for me is just funny just funny it's not going to

1027
01:50:46.80 --> 01:50:51.04
actually get you to do anything but just let's have fun I'm going to do it anyways I'm going to

1028
01:50:51.04 --> 01:50:55.52
let the atomic knee drops happen over and over again I'm going to and so why when I could go through

1029
01:50:55.52 --> 01:51:00.32
life just experiencing them and accepting them why not have some fun with the atomic knee drops

1030
01:51:00.32 --> 01:51:06.48
a long cold dives and those hot weather and the you know dehydration and the my profile why not have

1031
01:51:06.48 --> 01:51:11.36
fun with all those things yeah and I mean you probably know but it's unbelievable how much that

1032
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:21.76
helps you know what I think maybe because my view of motivation is so low yeah that to me it's just funny

1033
01:51:21.76 --> 01:51:27.36
like false motivation like just funny yeah and and it but it is fun yeah it's a fun thing

1034
01:51:27.92 --> 01:51:32.08
yeah that's all and that's kind of part of what I mean case so that you know the the mats I don't know if

1035
01:51:32.08 --> 01:51:37.60
you noticed I brought the mats in there so those mats there I think just like 16 of them

1036
01:51:37.60 --> 01:51:42.16
I forget how many but they cover a two full two car garage cover is it perfect it's a lot of

1037
01:51:42.16 --> 01:51:50.96
mats and the two inch thick ones so to move them you know up you know the topography is that even

1038
01:51:50.96 --> 01:51:56.40
so you had so you had like some legit challenge yeah yeah I'm not even saying that here's not

1039
01:51:56.40 --> 01:52:02.32
enough here here this is what happened so I came in put the mats right there boom one day I

1040
01:52:02.32 --> 01:52:07.12
don't know whenever the other day and then you know I walked the jay's office or brother you

1041
01:52:07.12 --> 01:52:11.28
know he was like oh hey what what are you doing there I was like oh I just put the mats in here he's like

1042
01:52:11.28 --> 01:52:16.40
you put the mats in here what do you you what did someone help you with that I looked at

1043
01:52:16.40 --> 01:52:22.88
I mean I said I don't need help but it was a joke because that's a line from this thing but um

1044
01:52:22.88 --> 01:52:29.92
but the point there is just that that attitude you know like no I don't need help no I don't you

1045
01:52:29.92 --> 01:52:34.96
know because I'm trying to be like jockel you know fucking hard core I don't need help little kids

1046
01:52:34.96 --> 01:52:39.12
can hurt me they can make me complete you know it's like that mindset but it's that is

1047
01:52:39.12 --> 01:52:43.68
change you're certainly into a complete savage but little kids can't hurt you and you can carry

1048
01:52:43.68 --> 01:52:48.08
the mats by your own yeah and you know that's another thing that's another little expression I

1049
01:52:48.08 --> 01:52:52.80
just because my son when he was could before he could talk well he would you know he would

1050
01:52:52.80 --> 01:52:59.12
want to do something he'd say let me say I do it by my own right I started by myself or on my own

1051
01:52:59.12 --> 01:53:10.80
yeah mixed up by my own so that became a thing here's a legitimate one that that just changed it

1052
01:53:10.80 --> 01:53:15.20
changed the specific thing where you know how I'd like I'd be the kind of fighting getting

1053
01:53:15.20 --> 01:53:24.48
enough sleep I just I'd let it ruin me so if I didn't have something specific like um

1054
01:53:24.48 --> 01:53:30.96
uh important to do so just throughout the day I'm tired you know whatever so now I never admit

1055
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:35.20
that I'm tired yeah that's a good great starting place yeah I've explained myself I've explained

1056
01:53:35.20 --> 01:53:40.08
not to my son is is you just don't admit ever that don't let those words come out of your mouth

1057
01:53:40.08 --> 01:53:45.68
yeah I'm tired I'm sore I'm whatever just stop you get in the teams you that's just that's just

1058
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:52.32
a putting up a red flag of being a complete pans don't do it don't do it as matter fact

1059
01:53:52.32 --> 01:53:56.08
you know what's jacked up is like I won't even let's say you and I would go out let's say

1060
01:53:56.08 --> 01:54:01.36
was wintertime and you and I would go out and I had a sweatshirt with me because I knew it

1061
01:54:01.36 --> 01:54:06.56
might get cold but what I would already and I have the sweatshirt in my hand I won't even

1062
01:54:06.56 --> 01:54:12.24
put it on you can't put it on yeah because then you then you might say like were you cold

1063
01:54:12.24 --> 01:54:17.52
I'm cold I need some more yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1064
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:21.36
yeah I'm gonna do that too or I should have said not do that yeah proud I don't remember the time

1065
01:54:21.36 --> 01:54:26.32
remember so I pick a told this story before remember time we're driving from L.A. it was like late at night

1066
01:54:27.12 --> 01:54:32.96
and you're like yeah I know I'm this big bad team guy or whatever but I'm kind of tired right now

1067
01:54:32.96 --> 01:54:38.000
and then almost like you just it was painful to let the words out of your mouth you know like you let

1068
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:43.20
them slip in it really hurt you so it was like maybe like three seconds later you said

1069
01:54:43.20 --> 01:54:46.48
fuck it I'll just drive them on tanner if I have to right now I'll just get in the mud

1070
01:54:48.48 --> 01:54:54.56
I don't want to see you guys but I was tired yeah I was driving and my wife says like

1071
01:54:54.56 --> 01:54:58.08
are you you haven't been sleeping much are you okay to drive I was like yeah

1072
01:54:58.08 --> 01:55:04.56
and I actually did the same thing I was kind of like well I'm super tired I can drive indefinitely

1073
01:55:05.76 --> 01:55:10.000
I don't know though I mean you I don't know maybe you're different maybe not but that's the

1074
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.96
actually no I don't encourage people doing that yeah don't encourage it that's a that's a horrible

1075
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:20.48
thing to do is drive when you're super tired yeah yeah don't do that but I'm quiet it's

1076
01:55:20.48 --> 01:55:25.76
it's having to be for but I'm quiet it's really boring to drive because so easy it's just so like you

1077
01:55:25.76 --> 01:55:32.48
don't so when you get like tired or sleepy whatever it's really easy to just fall asleep super easy

1078
01:55:32.48 --> 01:55:37.20
and that's hard because you can't control it it's like you think you can just I can control it

1079
01:55:37.20 --> 01:55:41.20
and sure there is little tactics like you can like hard to do little things that you know

1080
01:55:41.20 --> 01:55:45.84
and like paint on yourself whatever but man it's really hard to control it once you fall asleep

1081
01:55:45.84 --> 01:55:52.08
yeah no don't do that don't do that you wake up in a bridge in the bunkman just yeah

1082
01:55:52.08 --> 01:55:57.92
dead or wake up dead yeah yeah it's my good the I was reading this thing on motivation

1083
01:55:58.56 --> 01:56:04.40
and it said in this book I'm not saying that this true or not true but it said it made sense

1084
01:56:04.40 --> 01:56:10.24
where motivation people misuse word motivation and they confuse it with inspiration so

1085
01:56:10.24 --> 01:56:14.000
inspiration is like when someone gets y'all revved up to do something right so you're saying like

1086
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.72
what you know let's do this or you see a mansion now you're inspired to work hard for stuff

1087
01:56:18.72 --> 01:56:24.24
whatever listen to some speech some quote unquote motivational speech it inspires it doesn't

1088
01:56:24.24 --> 01:56:31.12
motivate you motivation is your your bare raw motive the motive for you doing it so let's say

1089
01:56:31.12 --> 01:56:36.56
I feel like I said this before but the let's say I want to get in shape you know girls will

1090
01:56:36.56 --> 01:56:40.96
get in shape for their wedding you know that's the motive is to be in shape for the wedding

1091
01:56:40.96 --> 01:56:45.68
okay so that doesn't go away so she's not necessarily inspired meaning she's like um she

1092
01:56:45.68 --> 01:56:51.76
got infused with some healing you know you just find motivation wouldn't go away but it would

1093
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:56.72
well it's no here's the moment we get there is discipline yeah yeah yeah yeah because the

1094
01:56:56.72 --> 01:57:00.64
motivation she wakes up at five o'clock in the morning you go get a workout in where she goes to work

1095
01:57:01.36 --> 01:57:05.44
it's really easy to just be like you know what I'm not feeling motivated today right right

1096
01:57:05.44 --> 01:57:11.12
I'll just get the get the wedding dress you know let out a little bit yeah but that just

1097
01:57:11.12 --> 01:57:17.20
means that the motive motivation the motive isn't strong enough to overcome her feelings

1098
01:57:17.20 --> 01:57:21.60
that's right don't rely on it yeah you're not gonna find a motivation that's strong enough

1099
01:57:21.60 --> 01:57:24.64
to make you do the things that you have to do all the time you don't you can't does an

1100
01:57:24.64 --> 01:57:29.44
exact kind of well it depends it just depends so consider a fighter stop consider a fighter

1101
01:57:29.44 --> 01:57:34.16
with a fight he has to make way bro yeah you're right guys don't make a fight I don't make

1102
01:57:34.16 --> 01:57:37.68
wait I'm saying that's what I'm saying though the motive and you know what you're not

1103
01:57:37.68 --> 01:57:42.56
with that you know in that motivation failed that motivation failed you know five weeks ago

1104
01:57:42.56 --> 01:57:46.88
when they when they five guys burgers yeah they had a five-guards burgers yeah you're right

1105
01:57:47.92 --> 01:57:52.24
so this one holds a line yeah it does totally now you can have fun with it and you can be

1106
01:57:52.24 --> 01:58:00.24
motivated to have discipline and you can say oh like Pete Robbins from origin geese I was up

1107
01:58:00.24 --> 01:58:06.72
with him in Maine and he's like got a bet to lose weight and he hit me with some false

1108
01:58:06.72 --> 01:58:11.04
motivation because we were out we were out and you know we were in order I was ordered

1109
01:58:11.04 --> 01:58:16.32
big steak and just getting after the grub and I said like how many more pounds do you

1110
01:58:16.32 --> 01:58:19.20
have you know we're talking about as I get a kind of soccer situation he's like no I

1111
01:58:19.20 --> 01:58:23.92
actually enjoy watching you eat delicious food you know you go to false motivation

1112
01:58:23.92 --> 01:58:29.76
coming out but in a funny way yeah and instead letting it out like that instead of being just

1113
01:58:29.76 --> 01:58:35.36
miserable why not just have some fun with it yeah yeah that's my advice yeah fully but then the

1114
01:58:35.36 --> 01:58:42.48
difference though like I said I agree you're right I mean the point I was maybe making was uh

1115
01:58:43.60 --> 01:58:48.40
was just the technical difference between motivation and inspiration you know how it's a

1116
01:58:48.40 --> 01:58:53.60
can we not talk about that you would it be you know because both those words just don't

1117
01:58:53.60 --> 01:58:59.76
get a much for me there's flimsy the week yeah the week words and the week and the and the actual

1118
01:58:59.76 --> 01:59:07.04
subjects are weak inspiration all right the vacation like it's not gonna get you there come on

1119
01:59:07.04 --> 01:59:12.24
it might get you through like the first three minutes of a you know you and I were just talking

1120
01:59:12.24 --> 01:59:17.84
before you came in here you said there was moments in your workout today when you put it easily

1121
01:59:17.84 --> 01:59:21.60
or yesterday you could have easily called it okay I mean I'm sweating I got a good workout but

1122
01:59:21.60 --> 01:59:28.80
you didn't you have the wine this one discipline it was actually I created false one it just

1123
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:35.12
truth be told you right but I've created false motivation for myself I said you know what I'm

1124
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:40.16
gonna I'm gonna do this actually it's the way for me to facilitate discipline for myself is I want

1125
01:59:40.16 --> 01:59:44.32
to do this because I'm gonna feel better afterwards you know that whole deal you're talking about

1126
01:59:44.32 --> 01:59:50.48
discipline then you contrast it with how junk I'm gonna feel if I don't weak embarrassed for myself

1127
01:59:50.48 --> 01:59:56.08
by the way and when I said that you know how workout has many opportunities to stop yeah so one

1128
01:59:56.08 --> 02:00:00.72
the first opportunity is in the parking lot in this case I went to a gym so bro if you walk away

1129
02:00:00.72 --> 02:00:04.24
when you're in the parking lot you got issues so I've done that I've done that like four times

1130
02:00:04.24 --> 02:00:07.76
and then I did admit that on the podcast you should just lie

1131
02:00:08.80 --> 02:00:14.40
I'm the left what makes this current story okay more significant so boom that's the first opportunity

1132
02:00:14.40 --> 02:00:19.84
second opportunity is before you warm up which is pretty close to the first opportunity before you

1133
02:00:19.84 --> 02:00:26.32
warm up you ever quit then yes oh my god twice one time it felt real good because I justified it

1134
02:00:26.32 --> 02:00:30.88
very effectively in the second time I was like I just got to get after it tomorrow whatever nonetheless

1135
02:00:30.88 --> 02:00:36.40
then then it's after the first body part or the first sort of you know you have I'm gonna do you know

1136
02:00:36.40 --> 02:00:43.20
Macon first I'm gonna do spots first so you know it's after the first exercise the body part really yeah

1137
02:00:43.20 --> 02:00:47.60
yeah okay that's one opportunity like to me the biggest hurdles getting there which is when you

1138
02:00:47.60 --> 02:00:53.68
have your Jimmy or house that's that turtle's gone I agree that it gets easier to hold the line for

1139
02:00:53.68 --> 02:00:58.56
sure after you start but there's a part at the end you know how like how you just said you like to do your

1140
02:00:59.44 --> 02:01:05.04
magnet like afterwards no lately I've been doing Macon before and lifting heavy after right

1141
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:09.92
yeah that's what I'm sure but you're right I could say you know what that Macon was a little bit heavy

1142
02:01:09.92 --> 02:01:15.44
yeah we were just calling good on the heavy part yeah exactly right and I feel so good when I'm

1143
02:01:15.44 --> 02:01:22.96
all loosened up yeah so I'm same deal with me and I you know every opportunity to quit

1144
02:01:23.92 --> 02:01:31.68
was passed was we've well done echo Charlie yeah that's a question yeah I got time for one more yes

1145
02:01:31.68 --> 02:01:53.44
juggle I am a chronic excuse maker how do I stop making excuses this is actually pretty simple

1146
02:01:53.44 --> 02:02:00.08
and I said at the other day and you have to realize you have to know you have to accept

1147
02:02:01.68 --> 02:02:11.20
that all your excuses or lies they are lies all of them think about the things

1148
02:02:12.48 --> 02:02:17.04
that you tell yourself the lies you use to rationalize taking the easy road

1149
02:02:17.04 --> 02:02:28.16
taking the easy road and leaving discipline behind think about them you don't have time

1150
02:02:30.08 --> 02:02:42.24
that's a lie you don't have support that's a lie you don't have the equipment or the gear

1151
02:02:42.24 --> 02:02:53.52
lies you don't you don't know the best way who cares that's a lie or you're too old or you're

1152
02:02:53.52 --> 02:03:04.64
too young of course you're too old or too young lie and there's you're too busy sure you are

1153
02:03:04.64 --> 02:03:15.92
that's a lie and you're too tired or you're too sore or you're just plain not feeling it

1154
02:03:15.92 --> 02:03:30.32
lies lies lies and the list goes on and on and on and it doesn't stop if you don't make it stop

1155
02:03:30.32 --> 02:03:49.04
so recognize recognize the excuses are not valid they are they are trumped up they're conjured up

1156
02:03:49.04 --> 02:03:55.52
they're fabricated they're lies and how do you stop the lies you stop the lies with the truth

1157
02:03:55.52 --> 02:04:08.80
the truth the truth will set you free the truth will stand and the truth will deliver you from

1158
02:04:09.52 --> 02:04:17.92
procrastination and laziness and the downward spiral that comes with a lack of discipline

1159
02:04:17.92 --> 02:04:28.40
so don't believe the lies believe the truth and the truth is you have time you have the skill

1160
02:04:28.40 --> 02:04:35.44
you have the knowledge and the support and the will power and the discipline to get it done

1161
02:04:35.44 --> 02:04:56.08
so cast out the lies burn them down and listen to the truth and live the truth and go out and get it done

1162
02:04:56.08 --> 02:05:12.72
and I think that's all I've got for tonight so echo you know speaking of the truth

1163
02:05:13.76 --> 02:05:22.64
could you perhaps explain to us how to support this podcast if we want to if we want to

1164
02:05:22.64 --> 02:05:31.20
share what you can do is support yourself I think I made this analogy before you know in the

1165
02:05:31.20 --> 02:05:37.28
aircraft right pre take off they go through the safety instructions in the event of cabin pressure

1166
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.08
loss yeah oxygen tank mask comes down put on yourself before you can all that I mean that's a good

1167
02:05:44.08 --> 02:05:49.52
kind of thing where you support yourself then you can help support others so support yourself

1168
02:05:49.52 --> 02:05:55.84
this is how with supplementation like it and again I'll say this again I'll say it every day if I

1169
02:05:55.84 --> 02:06:06.40
am compelled if I motivated to inspire you the way I'm now into supplements not a bunch but before

1170
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:14.56
I was like no supplements you just get good nutrition anyway so real oil and I think this is a

1171
02:06:14.56 --> 02:06:22.32
daily thing by the way and I think you can maybe relate I think daily on how happy I am that I take

1172
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:27.84
cruel oil and it's I don't like thank my lucky star nothing like that I'm just saying there are

1173
02:06:27.84 --> 02:06:33.12
daily things that it's on my mind that I'm like this experience would be different if I did not take

1174
02:06:33.12 --> 02:06:42.08
cruel oil straight up that is true so I got a so I back my car into the garage loading mats

1175
02:06:42.08 --> 02:06:47.44
the oh yeah that that was another time but this was more recently so it's getting filling you know

1176
02:06:47.44 --> 02:06:52.48
you fill up the five gallon things a water yeah and I talk about that so I'm putting like you

1177
02:06:52.48 --> 02:06:55.44
got a maneuver it because I said in the garage I should have pulled out but whatever

1178
02:06:56.72 --> 02:07:01.28
maneuvering a hard core man big times so I'm maneuvering got to take it out and I don't want to

1179
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:04.72
you know so you you start to explain but you know when you're in big space

1180
02:07:04.72 --> 02:07:12.88
whatever but everyone's true it's applicable everyday life the cruel oil isn't just for

1181
02:07:12.88 --> 02:07:20.08
deep squats heavy it's for taking five gallons of water in a jug out of tight spaces where you

1182
02:07:20.08 --> 02:07:23.92
got a kind of twist you know yeah because you don't want the car door to hit like the other

1183
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:28.88
car door to dent it good time to have the cruel oil in you yeah man and really that's well

1184
02:07:28.88 --> 02:07:32.32
that's part of the payoff is what big part is the everyday things

1185
02:07:32.32 --> 02:07:38.64
true for sure yeah there'd be times where I would be sitting down a long time and I stand up

1186
02:07:38.64 --> 02:07:44.64
and I'm surprised on how little pain I feel not pain you know what I'm saying yeah but you

1187
02:07:44.64 --> 02:07:48.64
have been like that where you think like yes I'm gonna feel like oh this this is gonna be

1188
02:07:48.64 --> 02:07:54.24
stiff or this is gonna be heard of what I and it's just simply not yeah yeah yeah that part is real

1189
02:07:54.24 --> 02:07:59.28
so get your cruel oil in the event of you even wanting cruel oil these are my experiences

1190
02:07:59.28 --> 02:08:05.60
obviously joc was this wokas you take cruel oil as well indeed um get them from on it on it

1191
02:08:05.60 --> 02:08:11.44
dot com slash jockel if you want the 10% off also the alpha brain so the cruel oil that's like

1192
02:08:11.44 --> 02:08:17.60
I don't think that'll ever go away no the alpha brain I am using a lot more

1193
02:08:19.36 --> 02:08:24.64
I'm reading more to coincidence maybe maybe not one might be causing the other correlation may not be

1194
02:08:24.64 --> 02:08:33.36
causation but I'm just saying that is happening and I will admit this as far as work out

1195
02:08:33.36 --> 02:08:40.32
skull I'm getting real into the kettlebells you've always been into the gas yeah not always but you know

1196
02:08:40.32 --> 02:08:49.52
15 yeah yeah no I would say like maybe 10 years or something 12 years yeah maybe it has been

1197
02:08:49.52 --> 02:08:53.84
15 years yeah because I just remember that picture jolrogant I think jolrogant and I were talking

1198
02:08:53.84 --> 02:08:58.32
about the picture of fadore yeah yeah look that out right when you guys are yeah fadore with the

1199
02:08:58.32 --> 02:09:04.08
pictures that with him it all it was okay cool yeah yeah yeah so I was kind of hard to get a magnet though

1200
02:09:04.08 --> 02:09:09.12
yeah well yeah so I think it was jolrogant saying how like somebody introduced them to

1201
02:09:09.12 --> 02:09:14.88
America and that's that's what's the machine guy yeah and they're they're really good um again

1202
02:09:14.88 --> 02:09:19.28
being careful every single moment but I'm to the point right now where like you know you get

1203
02:09:19.28 --> 02:09:23.52
kind of good any gets even fun or like anything and then I'm like oh let me get that heavier one

1204
02:09:23.52 --> 02:09:29.20
no I want to get to heavier one but I will say this about the kettlebells about my experience I

1205
02:09:29.20 --> 02:09:36.88
started off the kettlebells getting these these designer ones you know primal bells on it zombie bells

1206
02:09:36.88 --> 02:09:43.36
probably actually didn't get the zombie I got primal and then the legend where wolf ones anyway

1207
02:09:43.36 --> 02:09:48.72
they're cool right cool to look at so you know who I'm kind of like who I don't know if I should

1208
02:09:48.72 --> 02:09:52.32
be proud of this or shame to this but I'm like the kid the you know the teenager gets their

1209
02:09:52.32 --> 02:09:58.08
driver's license and the two types of kids there's the one kid who the dad's like hey you got

1210
02:09:58.08 --> 02:10:02.48
to learn to walk before you can fly so you got to like I don't know I'll make the down payment you

1211
02:10:02.48 --> 02:10:06.40
make the payments that's what my dad just said or you make the down payment or whatever you know like

1212
02:10:06.40 --> 02:10:10.96
you got to work for this first car and it might not be the you know the BMW whatever

1213
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:17.68
then there's the other kid who rolls right into the BMW you know hey good job you're 50 now big

1214
02:10:17.68 --> 02:10:24.80
big big time of your life time in your life whatever here's a dope car congratulations love you son

1215
02:10:25.36 --> 02:10:29.84
you know then there's that guy that's kind of who I am with the kettlebells you know I didn't like

1216
02:10:29.84 --> 02:10:36.000
pay my dues you know when the kettlebells were new and all the way to it yeah yeah yeah

1217
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:43.04
the dope kettlebell where wolf yeah anyway a lot of cool stuff on there on it dot com a lot of cool

1218
02:10:43.04 --> 02:10:48.72
stuff on there um all legit stuff that's I think the real compelling thing for me anyway

1219
02:10:48.72 --> 02:10:53.92
is because I know these supplements man they're whack I've heard of people getting their

1220
02:10:53.92 --> 02:10:58.40
supplements and then you know the supplement was like contaminated with something and then they say

1221
02:10:58.40 --> 02:11:02.88
oh yeah they just mix all the supplements in the same thing and the fact it's like it can be really

1222
02:11:02.88 --> 02:11:10.96
whack nonetheless on it that's the good ones quality so yeah if you want 10% off on it dot com slash

1223
02:11:10.96 --> 02:11:19.04
juggle strong bones are going to be for your 10 it's in my experience also amazon so where do we

1224
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:25.20
get these books sure we didn't do books today but we do what what 66% of the time would you say probably

1225
02:11:25.20 --> 02:11:29.44
some books yeah maybe more sometimes more than one book yeah last time we did three books three books

1226
02:11:29.44 --> 02:11:34.32
boom all on the website by the way yep so you know if you this is another support yourself

1227
02:11:34.32 --> 02:11:38.000
situation a lot of times people ask aid you know where which book was that again you know and they

1228
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.36
gotta go back where you don't you go ask for me for reading list hey do you have some kind of

1229
02:11:41.36 --> 02:11:46.24
reading list I'm like yes I got a reading list it's on soccer podcast dot com every book that I

1230
02:11:46.24 --> 02:11:50.64
end and by the way are there books that are there good books that you've read that that you

1231
02:11:50.64 --> 02:11:55.20
haven't put on the podcast not really when I read a book and it's good it's going on the podcast yeah

1232
02:11:55.92 --> 02:11:59.84
if I read a book and it's lame it's not going on the podcast now there's some books that are

1233
02:11:59.84 --> 02:12:05.52
informational but they don't cut it for the podcast you know I wouldn't recommend them I'll tell you a

1234
02:12:05.52 --> 02:12:12.000
little bit a little I just realized this I had a book selected for the podcast like three weeks ago

1235
02:12:12.72 --> 02:12:17.60
and I got a hundred pages into it it didn't cut the mustard for the podcast yeah and I'll tell you

1236
02:12:17.60 --> 02:12:22.16
that one of the major reasons for those of you that recommend me books a lot one of the major

1237
02:12:22.16 --> 02:12:27.36
reasons that it didn't cut the mustard for the podcast is not only was it not a first person account

1238
02:12:27.36 --> 02:12:35.36
but it didn't even have like a lot of excerpts of first person accounts it was just factually

1239
02:12:35.36 --> 02:12:38.80
this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened it was very well detailed it's a good

1240
02:12:38.80 --> 02:12:45.44
book but it wasn't podcast because if you if you want to do that if we're just going to read facts

1241
02:12:45.44 --> 02:12:53.52
dates facts elements maneuvering that's that's you could just listen to the audio book right

1242
02:12:53.52 --> 02:12:58.000
yeah just for or just go look on Wikipedia and it's going to tell you the dates and times and

1243
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.08
where it units maneuvered and who on the battle and how many people casualties they were right all that

1244
02:13:02.08 --> 02:13:06.08
stuff's in yeah we don't want just that I want to hear what the people were thinking I want to hear

1245
02:13:06.08 --> 02:13:11.28
they're from the human beings yep so even though there's people send me books if you're going to send

1246
02:13:11.28 --> 02:13:15.44
me a book look for the first person account if it's not a first person account like machete

1247
02:13:15.44 --> 02:13:20.24
season that's not a first person account but it it interviews the killers yeah so you're hearing the

1248
02:13:20.24 --> 02:13:28.88
first person accounts yeah and that reading list so that reading list is pretty pretty well

1249
02:13:28.88 --> 02:13:33.92
vetted that like straight up if it doesn't pass the jocco approval of recommendation it's not going

1250
02:13:33.92 --> 02:13:39.52
on the podcast not going on the podcast and then they're for you know no I'd rather not do a podcast

1251
02:13:39.52 --> 02:13:43.60
than put a lame book on the podcast not happening boom and that's the standard right there so

1252
02:13:43.60 --> 02:13:51.52
joccopodcast.com top menu little things says books from the podcast all of them right in a bit

1253
02:13:51.52 --> 02:13:57.60
later yep and what I'm kind of starting to do is like let's say you know how I like I mentioned that book

1254
02:13:57.60 --> 02:14:01.44
mine is called mine game just small little book I think you did you put it on there yeah

1255
02:14:01.44 --> 02:14:05.20
somebody somebody tweeted I didn't know you put it on there yeah so I'll put that kind of if

1256
02:14:05.20 --> 02:14:09.84
if you're if we mention a cool book and let's say you for what let's say it doesn't fit or you

1257
02:14:09.84 --> 02:14:14.88
didn't get to it or whatever but there's some sort of a for lack of a better term buzz going around

1258
02:14:14.88 --> 02:14:21.52
it yeah put it on there nonetheless point there is get the books from there click through there

1259
02:14:21.52 --> 02:14:25.36
that's a good way to support swanxian figure action and if you're just gonna just

1260
02:14:25.36 --> 02:14:30.48
shop for duct tape and other you know stuff that you need to do that too like do the website

1261
02:14:30.48 --> 02:14:38.72
double support double support yes dang still one action one big reaction you understand what I'm

1262
02:14:38.72 --> 02:14:48.08
saying also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes, Stature, Google Play and other podcast providing platforms

1263
02:14:49.12 --> 02:14:56.64
that's a good way to support of course and also YouTube some excerpts on there when yesterday today

1264
02:14:56.64 --> 02:15:02.64
yeah yesterday so those are even and I knew this before but those are getting more and more

1265
02:15:02.64 --> 02:15:10.000
in my opinion significantly valuable because even I you know I don't memorize every word of every

1266
02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:14.96
podcast but when I go through and I kind of look at it and you know and then you you know I listen

1267
02:15:14.96 --> 02:15:19.20
to it listen to the three minutes or whatever it's like a good little reminder it's like a refresher

1268
02:15:19.20 --> 02:15:23.60
and that's not to mention let's say if I totally forgot it you know yeah that's like all and not

1269
02:15:23.60 --> 02:15:30.000
to mention if you hear it and you go that reminds me of Bill he's having that issue gonna send it

1270
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:35.68
over to Bill no problem shareable yep and he's gonna he's gonna probably watch it as opposed to hey

1271
02:15:35.68 --> 02:15:42.48
Bill here's here's the podcast I was talking about with your issue it's he's 27 minutes long get some

1272
02:15:42.48 --> 02:15:49.92
excuse right Bill might not listen to that quite yet he might get around to it might not not if he's in

1273
02:15:49.92 --> 02:15:56.16
her not if he has a busy life still might find a way anyway but they are shareable and they're

1274
02:15:56.16 --> 02:16:01.12
quicker so you when you click I you can listen to them there excerpts including those and

1278
02:16:20.40 --> 02:16:27.60

1285
02:17:09.28 --> 02:17:21.28
cold places like where alaska oh yeah yeah that's true my or way yeah that's true also rash guards on

1286
02:17:21.28 --> 02:17:28.96
there though so is it too soon to have another rash guard it's too soon huh I don't really necessarily

1287
02:17:28.96 --> 02:17:33.84
think so yeah I actually think more rash guards is better is better than more the better yeah

1288
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:40.48
well hey we got two out so there's you know rash guards on there as well some women stuff and um

1289
02:17:40.48 --> 02:17:45.12
yeah if you want to support that way get yourself a garment there's a sick rash guard

1290
02:17:46.40 --> 02:17:52.88
the sick rash guard for like I said I've been hanging out a little bit with a guy named Pete Roberts

1291
02:17:52.88 --> 02:17:59.20
from origin geese up in Maine yeah my home of record for the military by the way doing lint

1292
02:17:59.20 --> 02:18:05.68
and he made a he made a rash guard like a special fourth July day rash guard

1293
02:18:06.72 --> 02:18:14.24
and I'm gonna go ahead and say affirmative it's out of control you got to check it out it is

1294
02:18:15.68 --> 02:18:26.56
George Washington wearing a ghee riding a snake a giant snake the don't tread on me snake

1295
02:18:26.56 --> 02:18:31.44
yeah so it's I don't know if he's gonna make a lot of them but if you don't have one

1296
02:18:32.16 --> 02:18:39.60
I think we all should basically have one origin main dot com you can get one of those origin

1297
02:18:39.60 --> 02:18:46.16
origin main m a i an e origin main dot com and what you know where you know where they're made

1298
02:18:46.96 --> 02:18:52.88
want you guess where they're made well you figure main no you figure oh well he's if he's

1299
02:18:52.88 --> 02:18:58.32
he's getting a rash guard they probably made in china maybe or maybe they're made in Pakistan

1300
02:18:58.32 --> 02:19:03.60
maybe or maybe they're made in Taiwan but there's also a whole bunch places that make them like

1301
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:10.000
Sri Lanka and Vietnam and Thailand maybe they're made there you'd be wrong on every single of those because you know

1302
02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:18.72
where they're made America they're made in Maine yeah so you might want to order one but do they

1303
02:19:18.72 --> 02:19:27.04
source like the material everything it's from me it's from America pizza crazy pizza doesn't play around

1304
02:19:27.84 --> 02:19:36.80
specially woven he's woven his he weaves his own material four geese to make geese with

1305
02:19:38.80 --> 02:19:43.12
yeah that's straight a main that's straight no that's this made the cotton comes from

1306
02:19:43.12 --> 02:19:49.20
South Carolina or something yeah shipped up to Maine looms you know what I mean no one will

1307
02:19:49.20 --> 02:19:55.76
be a fruit of the loom so it's like here and here's how I put it together ultimately so loom

1308
02:19:55.76 --> 02:20:00.88
it makes you know we've stuck right a little it's a basically a big weaving machine yeah I mean

1309
02:20:00.88 --> 02:20:05.92
this one doesn't that of course so now remember the brand fruit of the loom yeah oh I guess that's

1310
02:20:05.92 --> 02:20:14.56
the fruit of the loom well origin actually has their own looms once again here in Maine

1311
02:20:15.28 --> 02:20:22.64

1312
02:20:24.08 --> 02:20:29.60

1313
02:20:29.60 --> 02:20:36.96
the the rash card design the American the fourth-inch of the rash card design it's you know

1314
02:20:36.96 --> 02:20:43.12
things can get so over the top that they actually become cool yeah yeah that's where it's at

1315
02:20:43.12 --> 02:20:48.08
yeah that's where it's at like me I'm all about the subtle designs right you know oh yeah

1316
02:20:48.08 --> 02:20:53.04
what what should we do make a black yeah and then don't put much on it that's me he's like

1317
02:20:53.04 --> 02:20:58.56
took the other direction I'm gonna have a giant snake I'm gonna have George Washington with a black

1318
02:20:58.56 --> 02:21:03.84
belt on in an origingie I'm gonna have you know that's what I'm talking about yeah America

1319
02:21:06.32 --> 02:21:11.20
that's kind of like on kawai when you go to the North Shore and you can go North North North or you

1320
02:21:11.20 --> 02:21:16.56
can go west west west and you go too far because kawai is like a circle before you know it you're

1321
02:21:16.56 --> 02:21:23.84
essentially at the same place whoa yeah that yeah see oh my god yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I first

1322
02:21:23.84 --> 02:21:28.40
I wasn't following you yes you do get to the same place yeah so you went he went too crazy he went

1323
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:33.28
too crazy but he went so far in the world in the realm of crazy that it became dope you know because

1324
02:21:33.28 --> 02:21:40.32
you have like we we consider dope is like the perfect mix of crazy and understated in a current

1325
02:21:40.32 --> 02:21:47.12
contemporary or rebellion against yeah but he went in that one direction that you don't really

1326
02:21:47.12 --> 02:21:52.48
go for you know mass acceptance and then he took a two-fuck and now it's right into

1327
02:21:52.48 --> 02:22:02.08
the right where it needs to be. dopeness. it's like a logical warfare hey here's a question

1328
02:22:02.08 --> 02:22:07.28
tough question psychological warfare is this false motivation?

1329
02:22:08.40 --> 02:22:13.04
wait let me explain what it is because psychological warfare is an album with tracks of

1330
02:22:13.04 --> 02:22:20.88
jocco sane basically you know in moments of weakness on your journey whatever we can up early

1331
02:22:20.88 --> 02:22:26.16
sticking to the diet you know we're trying to get stuff done you know anti procrastination stuff

1332
02:22:27.20 --> 02:22:32.16
you can play these tracks and jocco will tell you how to get over that weakness for that moment

1333
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.52
so the question is is that false motivation?

1334
02:22:39.36 --> 02:22:43.84
because you did mention that you can use the false motivation yeah well maybe you are at that point

1335
02:22:43.84 --> 02:22:48.88
right it is possible you just can't depend on it you can't be like hey this this is

1336
02:22:48.88 --> 02:22:52.88
my whole thing yeah that's a good point it's going to get you there but if you're not

1337
02:22:52.88 --> 02:22:57.68
disciplined yourself those tracks are going to do anything for you right yeah exactly so why

1338
02:22:57.68 --> 02:23:02.40
okay these might be our pretty good yeah every powerful but it was like I was saying

1339
02:23:02.40 --> 02:23:07.92
and then we got to make psychological warfare too I've I've got to continue gather a couple more

1340
02:23:07.92 --> 02:23:13.60
tracks that I'm thinking about and what people been asking for so that they can you know have a little

1341
02:23:13.60 --> 02:23:19.20
little spot if they need a spot psychologically spot yeah so just you know what I was thinking of

1342
02:23:19.20 --> 02:23:23.36
naming spiked psychological warfare too what psychological warfare too

1343
02:23:25.20 --> 02:23:32.000
oh hey advanced for advanced but yeah that is what it is it's a spot so just like false

1344
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.80
motivation that can be just like a spot like you can't roll into the gym with your workout

1345
02:23:36.80 --> 02:23:41.20
partner and be like hey I'm gonna get under this bench it's four or five on there I want you to

1346
02:23:41.20 --> 02:23:45.84
do the whole thing I want you to upright row yeah that you know yeah you don't that's not what

1347
02:23:45.84 --> 02:23:52.000
a spot's for it's not what any of these things for it's I'm gonna do this in the unlikely event

1348
02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:58.32
that I run into something that might cause me to fail you got me that rest of the way that's it

1349
02:23:59.04 --> 02:24:04.64
so psychological warfare is too by the way but in my experience and opinion you can lean on that

1350
02:24:04.64 --> 02:24:12.32
pretty heavily it'll get you through it's my opinion also jocquite on amazon you can get that there

1351
02:24:15.52 --> 02:24:21.84
and I guess I got asked on twitter if I ever used any performance enhancing drugs no and I said

1352
02:24:21.84 --> 02:24:30.32
no but honestly let's just go ahead and face it um white tea is kind of the king of performance enhancement

1353
02:24:30.32 --> 02:24:39.60
as far as I've seen so obviously it's the only substance on the market that is guaranteed to

1354
02:24:39.60 --> 02:24:50.48
add 7,554 pounds to your deadlift so is that performance enhancing? probably luckily it's not

1355
02:24:50.48 --> 02:25:00.000
being tested for right now you know by the US DSA S P yeah them so you'd soon it's all right now you can get it

1356
02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.84
yeah get it you can just get that massive increase and everything that you do that's cool also

1357
02:25:05.84 --> 02:25:17.36
way the warrior kid and man so many people have been posting pictures of kids doing pull ups and

1358
02:25:17.36 --> 02:25:23.36
kids pulling tires and kids studying flashcards and kids making their own warrior kid codes

1359
02:25:23.36 --> 02:25:30.88

1360
02:25:30.88 --> 02:25:39.60
class it's so good to see so thanks everyone that is posted that and and shown what's going on

lathe or a sewing machine or on a construction site or your child's cradle or wherever you're working
