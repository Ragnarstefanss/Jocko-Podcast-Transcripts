[00:00:00] The pomegranate. What is the pomegranate?
[00:00:02] Chai.
[00:00:03] Light tea.
[00:00:04] Yep.
[00:00:05] That's what it is.
[00:00:06] What is your deep color?
[00:00:07] Your deep.
[00:00:08] So action.
[00:00:10] Action.
[00:00:11] All right.
[00:00:13] This right here is the first
[00:00:16] Jocco podcast.
[00:00:21] Here we go.
[00:00:23] I guess to start off
[00:00:26] how did we end up here? How did this happen?
[00:00:32] I guess I have to thank Tim Ferriss
[00:00:35] for initially having me on to his podcast.
[00:00:39] And that was via a couple of people that helped me out
[00:00:46] get on there, Kurt Pazley, Peter Latia.
[00:00:51] And they made some introductions
[00:00:52] and introduced me to Tim Ferriss. Tim had me on.
[00:00:59] Got a lot of good feedback on that show.
[00:01:02] And that led to me going on to Joe Rogan.
[00:01:06] So thanks to Joe Rogan for having me on as well.
[00:01:10] And once those two things happened,
[00:01:12] and I actually got online and started getting
[00:01:18] communicating with other human beings online.
[00:01:22] And they were asking, you should do a podcast
[00:01:26] because it was interesting.
[00:01:28] And both Joe and Tim told me to have a podcast
[00:01:34] because it was interesting.
[00:01:35] So as I got all that feedback, which was awesome,
[00:01:42] I kind of realized I should do a podcast.
[00:01:46] So I'm sitting here.
[00:01:48] My name is Joko Joko Willink.
[00:01:49] I was, if you don't know anything about me.
[00:01:52] I served 20 years in the military, retired in 2010, myself.
[00:02:00] And one of my buddies, guy by the name of Lave Babin,
[00:02:05] we started a company where we do leadership and management
[00:02:09] consulting for businesses, doing all that work,
[00:02:12] eventually got us to a situation where we had some knowledge
[00:02:16] and kind of aggregated some knowledge.
[00:02:19] And so we put that into a book, the book came out,
[00:02:22] and been doing pretty well.
[00:02:24] It's called Extreme Ownership.
[00:02:26] So that's who I am.
[00:02:29] Now I kind of sometimes find it a little strange
[00:02:33] just to be talking.
[00:02:34] And so as we decided to put this podcast together,
[00:02:39] at one point I had done some follow-up videos for Tim Ferris,
[00:02:44] for him to put on line, and I did those with a buddy of mine
[00:02:47] who's sitting here with me now,
[00:02:49] guy by the name Echo Charles, who is a longtime,
[00:02:54] due to training partner of mine.
[00:02:56] And he does video production.
[00:02:59] He's got a company called FlexPoint TV.
[00:03:04] And whenever I got to do something video related,
[00:03:08] he's my go-to guy.
[00:03:10] And so when this came, this opportunity came about,
[00:03:12] and we were filming the videos for Tim Ferris,
[00:03:15] and we had questions from the internet,
[00:03:17] and we were sitting there and he's filming,
[00:03:20] and we were basically doing a podcast,
[00:03:22] because we were talking, and we have conversations
[00:03:24] about leadership and about jujitsu and about problems
[00:03:27] and about everything.
[00:03:28] And that kind of rolled into, when we started talking
[00:03:32] about doing a podcast, and I said,
[00:03:34] hey, do you have audio equipment?
[00:03:36] Do you have a recorder?
[00:03:39] Do you have time?
[00:03:42] Do you have time to sit down and hang out with me
[00:03:44] and do this?
[00:03:46] And I do.
[00:03:49] He said I do.
[00:03:50] I do have all that stuff.
[00:03:52] And here we are.
[00:03:54] So then what we did was we took a bunch of questions
[00:03:59] that I got from online.
[00:04:02] People hit me with all kinds of different questions,
[00:04:03] which is awesome.
[00:04:05] Thanks to everybody for giving me that feedback
[00:04:09] and listening and talking and communicating with me.
[00:04:11] That's awesome.
[00:04:12] It's kind of weird because I've never been like
[00:04:15] the most social person in the world,
[00:04:18] and not that I feel lonely, because I never do.
[00:04:23] I don't care if I'm alone or not.
[00:04:25] So socially mean like online social.
[00:04:27] Definitely not.
[00:04:28] Definitely not online social.
[00:04:30] I mean, I had zero online presence prior to being on
[00:04:33] the Tim Ferriss podcast.
[00:04:35] And but even socially, I mean, I don't hang around with people.
[00:04:43] You know, I mean, I told you that like the last time I was over here,
[00:04:46] I said, hey, yeah, I just don't do that a lot.
[00:04:49] So it's kind of interesting to me being online
[00:04:51] and communicating with really thousands of people.
[00:04:55] And it's cool because I'm not used to having people
[00:04:59] that are kind of interesting.
[00:05:00] The same thing I'm interested in, you know?
[00:05:02] The Gigiitsu, the working out,
[00:05:04] you don't want to do better, they want to get better.
[00:05:06] They want to learn more.
[00:05:07] That's what I want to do.
[00:05:09] And it's cool to be able to communicate with a bunch of people
[00:05:12] that want to do the same thing.
[00:05:14] And you know, I think that's what this podcast,
[00:05:18] which I know is going to evolve into all kinds of different things.
[00:05:21] But I think the underlying theme will be lessons learned.
[00:05:28] You know, lessons learned.
[00:05:29] I want to learn from people.
[00:05:31] I want people to, I want to pass on what I've learned.
[00:05:35] I don't want people to make the same mistakes I made.
[00:05:38] I want to learn other mistakes that people have made.
[00:05:40] So I don't make them.
[00:05:42] And I think that's kind of the underlying theme here
[00:05:47] with this.
[00:05:49] Yeah.
[00:05:51] What about you?
[00:05:52] I mean, is there anything in your background
[00:05:54] that you would consider to be important for people to know?
[00:06:02] Above and beyond what you just said, no.
[00:06:05] That's, those are the relevant points for sure.
[00:06:10] That's, that's, as we talked about doing this,
[00:06:13] that's one of the things that struck me as you're a director,
[00:06:19] you know, for your business, you're a film director,
[00:06:21] and you don't get in front of the camera.
[00:06:23] That's not your thing.
[00:06:24] Right.
[00:06:25] And so that's why I think this interaction is good
[00:06:28] because you're, you draw things out of people.
[00:06:31] That's what a director does.
[00:06:32] Yeah.
[00:06:33] And I believe that's where you're going to be doing here.
[00:06:35] Yeah.
[00:06:35] Yes, especially what I did a lot of the Metamore stuff.
[00:06:39] That was essentially my, that's like maybe a third of the whole job.
[00:06:43] This is good stuff, how to.
[00:06:45] So the jujitsu players out there, if you followed Metamore
[00:06:48] and all the videos, the, what do they call,
[00:06:51] lead up videos?
[00:06:52] Yeah, like promo.
[00:06:53] No promo videos.
[00:06:54] For the matches, yeah.
[00:06:56] Those were, count down.
[00:06:57] The kill downs.
[00:06:58] That's right.
[00:06:58] Those were echo Charles material right there.
[00:07:02] So you to, occasionally hear his voice in the background,
[00:07:05] with a question.
[00:07:06] Yeah.
[00:07:07] So speaking to questions.
[00:07:09] Yeah.
[00:07:10] We got some questions from the, from the interwebs.
[00:07:13] Yeah.
[00:07:15] What we got for the first one here, we got.
[00:07:18] The first question is, why do you wake up early in the morning?
[00:07:23] Actually, this is, I kind of have the same question.
[00:07:26] Why?
[00:07:27] Because I wake up late.
[00:07:28] Oh, I was in the night club industry for a long time.
[00:07:31] So my schedule was just shifted.
[00:07:32] I still, you know, work out and, and work hard for the most part
[00:07:37] during the day, but my schedule was just shifted.
[00:07:40] But I think a lot of times I'm viewed as like, oh, this is like late
[00:07:43] riser, like early risers just to begin with kind of seem like these.
[00:07:48] Just to blend.
[00:07:49] You know, but if you just shift the schedule a little bit forward, you know,
[00:07:52] you're up for, let's say you get eight hours the hour.
[00:07:54] I know you get less than eight hours sleep, but let's say the typical person
[00:07:57] eight hours sleep.
[00:07:59] If you get eight hours sleep, but you wake up at 430 versus you get the same
[00:08:04] eight hours, hours of sleep, same waking, you know, our, or the same hours
[00:08:09] a way you can do and work and work and just start.
[00:08:11] But you wake up at, in my case, noon, the cramps.
[00:08:18] Where?
[00:08:19] What's the difference, really?
[00:08:21] Well, they're technically, there is no difference.
[00:08:22] And actually, I've talked to people that they're on the night shift, right?
[00:08:26] You know, so they get home at 4 o'clock in the morning.
[00:08:31] And, but I think we both know.
[00:08:36] I think we both know what the difference is.
[00:08:40] And, and I truly think, you know, that waking up early.
[00:08:45] Now, if that early means noon because you, you work until 7 o'clock in the morning or
[00:08:50] 8 o'clock in the morning and it takes discipline to get out of bed, then I believe that
[00:08:56] there's, then that's fine.
[00:08:58] But if you wake up whenever you want and you slept for 10 hours and you're lazy
[00:09:04] getting out of bed, I think that affects your whole life in a negative way.
[00:09:07] I really do.
[00:09:08] I think it's not good.
[00:09:11] And again, I know that some people are on those schedules.
[00:09:15] And I know that some people need more sleep.
[00:09:17] That's, that's, I understand that.
[00:09:19] There's some genetics involved.
[00:09:21] I have one of my daughters genetically.
[00:09:25] I will go to bed at 11 o'clock at night.
[00:09:29] She's still awake.
[00:09:30] I wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning.
[00:09:32] She's awake.
[00:09:33] So there's some genetic weirdness going on there.
[00:09:37] Yeah.
[00:09:39] What, as far as getting up early, let's say, well, how you said, okay,
[00:09:45] it takes discipline to get out of bed.
[00:09:46] Wouldn't that kind of indicate that maybe you need some more sleep?
[00:09:51] Because let's think of like what they know, what they call the natural sleep cycle.
[00:09:56] You go to sleep.
[00:09:57] You sleep your however 7.
[00:09:59] I think ideal 7 and a half or something like that.
[00:10:03] And you naturally wake up.
[00:10:05] You got your S.
[00:10:06] But if you, if you got a drag yourself out of bed, doesn't that kind of indicate you need more
[00:10:09] rest?
[00:10:10] Possibly.
[00:10:11] But you could be right.
[00:10:15] But you know how you always say like, what do you say?
[00:10:18] Psychological victories?
[00:10:19] Psychological victories.
[00:10:20] Right.
[00:10:21] So isn't that kind of, it's a mental exercise, right?
[00:10:25] Yes.
[00:10:26] So you're, if that's part of your routine to fight adversity, you end up getting better
[00:10:32] at fighting adversity, whether it's that tiredness you feel or actual physical pain or
[00:10:39] you know.
[00:10:40] So you sleep, like if you decide to sleep more, it's because it feels good, right?
[00:10:45] So right, then it's good for you.
[00:10:49] But what if you want more candy?
[00:10:53] You know, if you want more candy because it tastes good, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[00:10:56] it's good.
[00:10:57] In fact, it's not good.
[00:10:59] But I do think that there's times that I do definitely need more sleep.
[00:11:03] And, but I don't.
[00:11:05] And I also know that there's a fine line.
[00:11:07] I know when I get, I know when I get over-trained.
[00:11:09] I know when I get not enough sleep and I feel it.
[00:11:13] And my workout starts going backward and my, GG2 starts going backwards and my life starts
[00:11:19] going a little bit backwards.
[00:11:21] And then I know, okay, you know, you, you need to, you need to take a day, you need to relax,
[00:11:26] sleep more.
[00:11:27] Maybe like wake up at like five.
[00:11:29] Yeah, a sleep into like five thirty.
[00:11:32] And you can always tell that when we were training fighters from the UFC, you could tell
[00:11:35] when they, when they reached their limit, when they were over-training, it was so
[00:11:39] obvious that we just fall apart on the mat, just completely fall apart.
[00:11:45] And you know, the other thing is, I, I'm like making a big deal out of waking up early.
[00:11:50] There's millions of people in the world that, that's what their job is.
[00:11:55] They're a single mom and they got to work two jobs and they're getting up at earlier
[00:11:59] than I am and they're going to bed later than I am because they're supporting their
[00:12:01] family.
[00:12:02] So I'm not sitting here saying this is the be all end all.
[00:12:06] But I will say that it definitely, it definitely has an impact and it definitely affects
[00:12:11] the other things in your life if you have that discipline early in the morning.
[00:12:15] It, it will help you across the board.
[00:12:18] Yeah.
[00:12:19] And I, I'd always read this stuff about creative people.
[00:12:23] And this is a complete generalization, but they say that creative people tend to stay
[00:12:28] up later.
[00:12:29] And, you know, usually when you stay up later, you wake up later, whatever.
[00:12:34] It's so, if you're mentally weak, yeah.
[00:12:39] So couldn't it be kind of seen, couldn't it be seen like when my early waking is a total
[00:12:47] lack of creativity?
[00:12:48] No, it seems like here you're driven to get things done, you know, get the job done, get
[00:12:57] the job done well, no excuses, right?
[00:13:04] And at the same time develop your physical mental toughness and improve yourself in these
[00:13:07] ways that it's essentially like, I don't want to say the chores in life, but it's like
[00:13:14] you, you, you, you want to get up and maximize the day and get the most work done possible,
[00:13:18] right?
[00:13:19] So if you, let's say okay, I typically, let's say I wake up at 8 a.m.
[00:13:24] I do my work, I get home at 5 and I, you know, I kind of goof off, watch some TV and maybe,
[00:13:32] I don't know, maybe even go out to a bar or something like that, where all the work is
[00:13:36] done, there's no work to be done really.
[00:13:38] This far is just kind of in a general way of saying it, there's no work to be done at
[00:13:43] the bar, there's no work to be done watching TV or whatever.
[00:13:47] So a person that lacks discipline, they're going to, it's pleasurable, the bars pleasurable,
[00:13:53] you know, for, you know, generally speaking, TV's pleasurable, so they're going to be all focused
[00:13:57] on that, like, I don't want to go to bed and face the work day the next day.
[00:14:02] I don't want to charge the work day.
[00:14:04] I want to immerse myself in the fun part of it, in the candy part of it.
[00:14:08] Then they wind up going to bed late and then they wind up having to drag them
[00:14:12] self out of bed, maybe sleeping a little bit more.
[00:14:15] So wouldn't kind of that discipline that you talk about,
[00:14:18] that applies to the whole day, not just waking up early, right?
[00:14:21] So it's like a whole system. So a lot of people, like, you, that that I've noticed,
[00:14:28] you focus really hard on getting stuff done. And if you maximize the time you have to get it done,
[00:14:33] when you wake up early, then you can do that, effectively.
[00:14:36] And at the same time, I don't want to give the impression that I'm living this, like,
[00:14:41] task driven life where I have every minute of the day scheduled, because then that does inhibit
[00:14:47] your ability to do other things. You inhibit your creativity, obviously. But, you know, I'll
[00:14:56] train you, Jitsu. And I'm going to go there for maybe I'll just go there for 45 minutes and get
[00:15:02] some rounds in. Maybe I'll be there for three hours. And I don't necessarily know that when I show up,
[00:15:07] because I have some flexibility in what I'm going to do in the day. The waves are good,
[00:15:12] may I go surfing, you know, but you're right that you have to be disciplined. It's not getting out
[00:15:20] of bed is like the foundation of the discipline. And I think it carries over everything else,
[00:15:26] because we get out of bed early. And then you work out. When you get done working out,
[00:15:30] me personally, I don't want to eat junk when I get done working out. I'm like, oh, you know,
[00:15:34] I did a good workout. I'm feeling good. I'm feeling healthy. Instead of eating a bowl of lucky
[00:15:38] charms, I'm going to eat, you know, some eggs and bacon and something good. So I agree with you on that.
[00:15:47] Yeah. So, um, fear is kind of a little side note to that question. Well, to me,
[00:16:00] one of the things people ask me like, what drives you, which is kind of a weird question,
[00:16:05] because it's a big question. I guess that's not a weird question. It's a big question. What drives
[00:16:10] you like a long list of answers on the one. But one of the things that I definitely
[00:16:16] think of as a driver of me is fear. And it's, you know, fear of failure, fear of being a
[00:16:25] detective. Yes. Yes. What drives me. But and this comes from, I remember being in the
[00:16:32] SEAL teams. I was when I was a young guy in the SEAL teams. I was very afraid of making mistakes
[00:16:39] and looking stupid or doing dumb things and getting a bad reputation. And that fear got me to
[00:16:44] work early and got me to inspect my gear three more times and got my me to ask my buddy to inspect
[00:16:50] my gear to make sure we were good to go. So I think that's what the fear is. And then there's also
[00:16:55] the fear of what the enemies doing. And how hard are they training? And are you training harder than them?
[00:17:02] And now that I'm in the civilian world, I'm thinking, okay, what is, what is, you know,
[00:17:07] some other company doing better than we're doing? And how can we overtake them? You know? And that's
[00:17:14] some weird fear and competitiveness that, you know, everybody has. Some people more than others.
[00:17:21] You got a balance it for sure. But it's definitely one of those things. Yeah. Yeah,
[00:17:27] sometimes that can get in the way, especially when you mentioned like, what is that other company
[00:17:32] doing? So I knew this guy that my brother worked with that he would be one of those guys where
[00:17:39] he'd be really concerned on what's the, what's the competition doing? So he'd be developing this
[00:17:44] aspect of his company and it's like right in the middle of development. Yeah. And
[00:17:48] but he'd be paying the tail. You know, one air would be on the, you know, what's going on with this other
[00:17:51] company? And they'd do some new thing or go in some new direction that really yields a lot of success
[00:17:56] for. And we got to do that. We got to, meanwhile, these other ideas that are solid, viable ideas are
[00:18:01] left half developed or the resources are kind of allocated to do this new thing and not so much
[00:18:06] the old stuff. And you know what, I actually got asked is working with a company the other day and they said,
[00:18:11] you know, how much will we be focused? Because I said something along these lines. This is,
[00:18:15] how much will we be focused on what the enemy, on what the competitors are doing? And should we be
[00:18:20] afraid of them? And I said, actually fear is the wrong word. You shouldn't be afraid of the enemy,
[00:18:28] but you have to respect them. And I think that's the thing that gets me out of that in the early
[00:18:34] in the morning is that I respect the enemy. I'm out of freedom, but I respect them and I'm going
[00:18:40] to be ready to do battle with them when it's time comes. You know, this is kind of a side note,
[00:18:45] but isn't, don't you kind of think too sometimes where it's, you're almost like reflecting yourself.
[00:18:51] When you say you're, you're, you respect and you, for lack of a vector, fear the enemy,
[00:18:56] what they're doing to prepare, because you know what you're doing to prepare, and it's pretty hard.
[00:19:00] So you kind of almost in the back of your mind is thinking they're probably doing all this too.
[00:19:05] You know? So it's like the more you do, the more you kind of inableared some kind of just way
[00:19:09] might think they're doing the same thing, you know? So it's like boom boom, this never ending
[00:19:13] like, it's in your arms race. Yeah. It's a arms race. Yeah. It's a arms race, someone. Yeah.
[00:19:17] And if you get caught up in it to a point like the example you just gave you, I can drive you crazy.
[00:19:22] And you know, it'll drive you to failure. You know, you have to be able to stand on your own and
[00:19:27] and say, okay, we're going to, we're going to maneuver regardless of what the enemy is doing.
[00:19:30] We're going to make our, we're going to make our moves. Yeah.
[00:19:37] Next, what do we got next? Next question.
[00:19:41] Oh, actually there's a, life, you know, and other people, single one. Yeah, I kind of,
[00:19:47] I kind of went through that. Yeah, as this, this applies to everyone. So under like concept.
[00:19:55] Okay. Well, then, and you kind of talked about this before mental toughness. How do you, and
[00:20:02] this is an unknown that applies to me where, certain, you see it even in high levels, certain people,
[00:20:08] it's almost like they've navigated their way through life and two into success, not really
[00:20:15] needing that much mental toughness because maybe they had some special attribute that allowed them
[00:20:21] to be successful early on and kept them succeed. You know, like these athletes were in the most
[00:20:25] center of the reality. Yeah. And, you know, and you, you kind of noticed it when things get rough
[00:20:31] for them, that's when they break or whatever. And so, I mean, I'm not saying I'm like a superior athlete
[00:20:38] or nothing like that, but it just so happens in a lot of ways, some ways, whatever.
[00:20:42] Um, I managed to avoid developing mental toughness up until about maybe two years ago. Maybe.
[00:20:55] But, and I, of course, I know how mine came about. I think, I mean, the main reason was just
[00:21:03] through maturity and seen it around me, but let's say I didn't, I wasn't surrounded by people
[00:21:09] who are mentally tough and they didn't see the value firsthand. How do you just develop mental
[00:21:14] toughness? Again, this is one of those things that people ask and this was a big question from
[00:21:20] online. You know, tons and tons of people asked how do you develop mental toughness? How do you
[00:21:26] become more mentally tough? And, you know, you and I did that video on it, or it's like, if you
[00:21:31] want to be more mentally tough, then be tougher. You know, and, and you get these people that are out there
[00:21:41] that sell courses on developing mental toughness and, you know, they're either going to bring you
[00:21:47] into a room and get you into some spiritual state and say, okay, listen, you've got to visualize
[00:21:54] the mind of the wolf and you are going to see it through the eyes of the wolf. What does a wolf do?
[00:22:02] The wolf does not back down. He leads the pack. And they're, I call this stuff, right? Okay,
[00:22:07] I'm not, I don't know, you know, and not, not my gig right there, because because the cool thing
[00:22:14] about mental toughness is, is it's just a simple choice that you have to make? Are you going to
[00:22:19] go through this thing that's hard, this thing that's tough, this thing that sucks, are you going to
[00:22:23] suffer through it, or are you going to quit? It's really easy. You, you just go, okay, I'm going to
[00:22:28] suffer through it. I'm going to deal with it. Then you're mentally tough. Done. Next question. Let's move
[00:22:32] on to something more important. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't that, and maybe I'm wrong
[00:22:38] here, but that sounds like the answer coming from someone who has, doesn't sound crazy, but has
[00:22:43] the luxury of being mentally tough. So, if when you're, do you ever remember time that you were
[00:22:48] not that you were straight up mentally weak? Do you ever remember any time? No. 1996, I was, now I'm just kidding.
[00:23:03] You know, like, I'll tell you people talk about in-seal training. They say, oh, everybody,
[00:23:08] everybody wants to quit at some point during seal training, and I literally, not at all, never
[00:23:14] from one second, do I think I'm going to quit? I don't want to do this anymore. Not even a chance.
[00:23:18] That's ridiculous. Who says that? Seal said, yeah, absolutely. You know, everyone thinks about
[00:23:25] quitting sometime. No, and I got plenty of bros and the seal teams that never thought about quitting.
[00:23:30] Yeah, I'm telling my best friends. Yeah. They said, no, you don't even think about quitting. Yeah.
[00:23:35] And so those guys are mentally tough. And, okay, so if you're not mentally tough, if you view
[00:23:40] yourself as mentally weak, then you got to do things, I guess, push yourself to that threshold,
[00:23:47] and how do you push yourself to that threshold? You do mentally challenging things. You do
[00:23:50] physically challenging things, and you push through them. Yeah. And then that might develop your
[00:23:56] mental toughness more. Right. Yeah, you think that, like, any exercise, getting the reps, you need
[00:24:03] to get those reps of hard stuff mentally. Like, that's something I analogy you just made. That's not.
[00:24:10] That doesn't seem like that would ever work. No matter if you're visualizing yourself as a wolf or
[00:24:15] whatever, you're not even getting the reps. That's like saying, oh, I've never played basketball
[00:24:21] ever. I've never been held a basketball, but guess what, we're going to get you. We're going to
[00:24:24] prepare you to be good at basketball, close your eyes, visualize play basketball, and that's your reps.
[00:24:29] Yeah. So, it probably won't work. So, back to the fear thing. We're going to be hammered because
[00:24:34] all these people can be like, no, if you visualize you get better. That's true. Right. You're not
[00:24:38] in mental strength, but mental toughness. You're right. You're my fear. That's more of a motion
[00:24:42] thing. Right. You visualize, you know, winning and reacting and so mental toughness, maybe,
[00:24:48] but it won't substitute reps. Like, if you're scared of something, for example, that should be
[00:24:53] like a flag. We're an indicator that, okay, I got it. Let's get some reps right here. I'm
[00:24:57] scared of this. You're right. And that being said, like you talking about your body, your
[00:25:01] seal buddies, that never we're going to quit, right? And I was definitely never going to quit.
[00:25:07] Well, I didn't have any reps going into that of, you know, mentally challenging things or whatever.
[00:25:13] I mean, what did in life, in life, but this is why I say that. I'm not, I obviously wasn't in
[00:25:20] the seal team, so they might find that hard to believe. No, these guys both played football,
[00:25:29] do you want school? They both, one of them's father was a Navy seal and just growing up a certain
[00:25:38] way with a certain environment does make you tell, like, let's say your father, just not letting
[00:25:43] you quit. Like, you play at least even about Warner football. And your dad's like, no, you, you can't
[00:25:50] quit. Like, I want to quit this is lame. I'm not good. Or if I'm so just so tired of my hurt or whatever,
[00:25:55] and your dad's saying, no, you don't quit and it just is in your mind. And this is the
[00:25:58] crazy thing about the seal teams is there's kids that grew up in, you know, some rich town with
[00:26:05] very wealthy parents and went to an Ivy League school and they're tough and there's kids that
[00:26:10] grew up with no dad and, you know, a single mom and their their toughest hell. So that theory is
[00:26:17] almost debunked because where does that mental toughness come from? It becomes from a bunch of
[00:26:22] different places that just is interpreted and kind of internalized in the same way. And I'll tell
[00:26:28] you where I think it comes from. I think it comes from when a when a human being decides that they're
[00:26:33] going to achieve their goals and they're going to go through whatever obstacles, then that's where
[00:26:36] mental toughness comes from. It is a decision that human beings make to make it happen.
[00:26:42] Yeah, yeah, but I think that when you know, like you're doing it right now, you're
[00:26:49] shrinking responsibility for mental toughness. That's what you're doing. I'm trying to narrow it down.
[00:26:54] You're basically, you're basically saying right now like you didn't, if you weren't developed
[00:26:59] away that raised mental toughness and as everyone else has followed, it's your fault you're not tough.
[00:27:04] Take me the exact opposite of extreme ownership of my black mental tough for former
[00:27:11] and working on it. No, but I think it is a lot of environmental factors. You're like you become tough
[00:27:17] because of certain environments. Yeah, I guess I guess we we would need to see what happens with a
[00:27:23] people that aren't mentally tough. Because where do they end up they end up in the gutter?
[00:27:27] They end up dead. They end up in jail. They end up in bad places because they weren't mentally
[00:27:32] tough. They didn't figure it out. They didn't drive through it. And so we don't even know who those
[00:27:36] people are. What happened to them? They failed. They didn't make that decision. They didn't decide
[00:27:44] that they're going to get out of that bad situation that they're going to push through that scenario.
[00:27:47] The guys that you played football with, they drove through that. Those bad situations got there.
[00:27:53] No, that's how they did it. They decided to do it. Yeah. Yeah, making that decision, I guess
[00:28:00] it's they would have to sort of access a place in their mind where that decision is final.
[00:28:06] Because a lot of times people say, yeah, I'm going to do this and that's my dream and
[00:28:11] I'm going to be an architect and then when they go to college when the beginner class is
[00:28:16] three hours a day for five days, they're, oh, wow. Well, no. That's one thing that the
[00:28:22] seal training does very well is gets rid of those people. Because everyone that shows up there
[00:28:28] thinks they want to be a seal until you know, to be ex into it. And then you've got half the
[00:28:33] guys and then you end up with 20% of the guys. And everyone has that dream when they show up there.
[00:28:37] Yeah, but that dream gets crushed. So as a try to imagine yourself, you probably not be able to
[00:28:44] do this, but imagine yourself mentally not tough. Okay. I don't even want to say weak, just an average
[00:28:49] person, you know, when you get you're doing some push-ups, you hit about 15, you're like,
[00:28:56] all you hit 20, you're like, okay, I can't do anymore. So you stop doing the push-ups. Okay.
[00:29:00] Not the guy who's going to get those five extra. You're not that guy.
[00:29:03] Yeah. Is there an exercise or an approach to just be on the path that at least increase my mental
[00:29:13] your mental toughness? Yeah. Like what they're like, keep going.
[00:29:17] Yeah, but I don't want to get I can't keep going. Yes, you can. I mean, I can. Yes. Yes, you can.
[00:29:22] That's the difference. You can. You just got to sit. Okay.
[00:29:26] Okay. I remember I read the small little book. It was called Mind Games. And there was
[00:29:33] just one short chapter on, on anger, anger issues. And I never had angry issues or nothing like that,
[00:29:44] but I'd like anyone else as young as like, I don't know, 22, 24. You know, I get mad and think
[00:29:49] I'm better than certain rules. And when I get caught out on the rules, I'd pitch it, like, you know,
[00:29:52] having attitude or whatever. So I read this little chapter and it said, anger issues along with
[00:30:02] other things comes from a low self esteem because you're real sensitive and you react, you know,
[00:30:08] in this aggressive way or whatever. But the word low self esteem was like a trigger for me. So
[00:30:13] having a low self esteem for whatever reason, that was like an embarrassing thing. Yeah. So I, so,
[00:30:18] you know, so that could be a little trigger. So you could find little triggers in, let's say,
[00:30:23] you know, you're doing push ups and you don't want to do five more. The fact that you
[00:30:26] don't want to do the five more, that should be embarrassing to you. Yeah. You know, like, if you
[00:30:30] kind of tell yourself that, that'll help you make that decision where I'm not going to
[00:30:35] embarrass myself right now. You know, so that fear of embarrassment can get you into the mode to
[00:30:41] to want to exercise more mental toughness, you know, any that trigger. And at the end of the day,
[00:30:46] when you feel that weakness, it's a choice to make to overcome it. It's not that big of a deal.
[00:30:52] You just sock it up and do it. Let's go to the next question.
[00:31:08] What are some key mental and physical steps or patterns to stay on game?
[00:31:14] Yes, this is one of those questions that we got a very simple,
[00:31:18] just a very similar question to this. What are the five key?
[00:31:23] And people want to put numbers on things, especially these days. I think people's
[00:31:26] intelligent Spain. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People want to see a list of, okay, if I do this.
[00:31:30] Yeah. And I guess, you know, that's, it sells. Right. What are the five,
[00:31:35] in fact, they've done a bunch of articles about life and they, they, they throw like a number on them.
[00:31:40] The 12 things, the three things because people want to believe that there's a finite number
[00:31:47] of steps to take. And also as far as an article for consumption, it makes you feel mentally
[00:31:53] comfortable to know that, okay, it's not this old, it's finite. No, no, no, no, not much. I'm going to read.
[00:31:57] I know I'm going to read the 12. You know, and that's what I'm going to eat. You know,
[00:32:03] you know, this is going to go back to what we've already been talking about. You know,
[00:32:06] for me, waking up early, working out every day, taking ownership of what you're doing and
[00:32:11] responsibility of things that are in your life, making sure that you periodically, throughout
[00:32:24] the day, throughout the hour, maybe not throughout the minute, but that you detach yourself
[00:32:31] from the situation that you're in. You detach yourself from it and you look at yourself and
[00:32:37] you assess. And I think that has a huge impact. And you know, I talk about that a lot, that
[00:32:43] detachment that it is something that I learned in the seal teams. And I learned it when bad things
[00:32:52] were happening. And if you get sucked into those bad things and you're in them mentally, emotionally,
[00:32:59] and physically, you can't assess well, because you're in the problem. It's like when you're
[00:33:05] watching a horror movie and, you know, they're like voluntarily, you know, oh, there's a noise
[00:33:12] down in the basement. Let's go see what it is. Everyone that's watching the movie that detached
[00:33:15] from the situation is screaming at the screen. No, don't do it. The people that are there are
[00:33:20] are saying, yes, let's go check it out because they're emotionally and physically and mentally
[00:33:26] in the situation. So having the ability to detach from the present from being an inside your own
[00:33:33] head, being able to detach from that is usually important because it allows you to do a real
[00:33:38] assessment of yourself and then finally stay in humble. You can't ever think that you've got
[00:33:48] everything figured out. You've got to constantly be saying, you know, what can I do better? What can
[00:33:52] I fix? What am I screwing up? And people are going to give you advice and you've got to take it
[00:33:59] and listen to it and see if it's good or not, maybe put it to the test. But I think those things,
[00:34:05] you know, waking up early, working out, taking ownership of stuff, being able to detach an
[00:34:11] assess and stay in humble. Those are those are kind of my main stays if I had to call them out
[00:34:17] on the list of five things that make you better. Yeah, the ownership that I don't, I mean, they're
[00:34:25] all pretty, you know, these are all challenges for sure. These aren't just easy things to do,
[00:34:30] but the ownership, I think that's a big key, like, in your book, what it talks about, the whole theme
[00:34:37] of the book, extreme ownership, where any situation when something goes wrong, when it doesn't
[00:34:42] go perfectly or you want it to go better. It's so easy, super easy, especially if you're emotionally
[00:34:48] charged or whatever. It's so easy to be like, well, that guy didn't do his job or whatever. And a lot
[00:34:53] of the cases, it's true. That guy didn't do his job. And then when you do that, you don't even think
[00:34:59] about or you don't honestly tell yourself, or think about what you did or what you didn't do,
[00:35:06] you know, or what you did wrong, you know, to make that, you know, to what role you played.
[00:35:11] And that's why that detachment is critical, because if you don't detach, it's very easy to be in
[00:35:17] your own head and say, well, echo screwed up his part, and that's why we failed the mission,
[00:35:21] because echo didn't do his job. And now, but as soon as I hear myself saying that, when I'm saying
[00:35:27] it, it's okay. When it's coming out of my mouth, right? I see myself saying it, then I know that
[00:35:33] I've, yeah, I've gone the wrong way. I know that I've made a mistake. Yeah. And what's interesting
[00:35:39] is when you, when you, and it's something you can do right now, you don't have to get trained in it,
[00:35:44] you can start practicing taking ownership of everything you possibly can't literally right now.
[00:35:49] And what I found and really like about it is that it works not just like with business, it works
[00:35:56] with everything, relationships with friends, relationships with your wife, your girlfriend,
[00:36:01] her boyfriend, and whatever, all that. It works amazing in all those situations. So it apply this
[00:36:06] really kind of like a staple for life. You don't like a way to conduct yourself in life.
[00:36:14] Yeah. And that is, that is why that is why that became the title of the book, because that is the
[00:36:19] underlying characteristic that helps people in their life. And I mean, that means as a leader,
[00:36:26] of course, obviously, in a, in a pressure situation, obviously, in a business, obviously, but you're
[00:36:32] right. And it takes transitions across the board to life. And it makes you successful across the board
[00:36:39] when you take ownership of everything, no doubt about it. So at age 44, you get out of bed,
[00:36:49] bus your ass, like the next mission is around the corner. What drives you? Actually,
[00:36:56] you kind of talked about that kind of that fear of the enemy's preparation. Yeah. But what do you, you know,
[00:37:05] this is one of those things that when people start talking about war,
[00:37:16] and what war does to people? And you know, nowadays we're hearing, and we see more, and we know more
[00:37:28] about what war does to people's minds. And obviously, it is, it can have some some extremely
[00:37:42] negative impacts on people. And there's a lot of veterans right now that are suffering, that are
[00:37:50] having a hard time. And I think for me, when I think about what drives me,
[00:38:06] it's an extremely powerful force that's driving me today. And that is that I served with guys,
[00:38:24] that sacrifice their lives so that we could be here, so that I could be here,
[00:38:34] so that we could have freedom. So that I could have never mind freedom, so that I could be here all
[00:38:41] life. And when you think about that, when you think about this gift, this gift that you've been given
[00:38:56] to come back to America and be free and have a life and have liberty and be free for the pursuit
[00:39:07] of happiness. And you think about that gift. It's the most beautiful thing anyone could ever give you.
[00:39:16] It's been given to you. It's been given to me. And I will not squander that gift. And I will make
[00:39:23] every day count as I remember those guys that gave that gift to me.
[00:39:34] Yeah, funny how like, you know how you kind of get a glimpse of certain people's life and how they
[00:39:43] how they behave and how they act what their routine and schedule is. And when you like you just
[00:39:50] hearing that and you've said that before and you've even kind of said that to me before and it kind
[00:39:56] of reminds you how much reminds me how much I'm not doing. You know, if you get free money,
[00:40:06] it almost means less than if you earn it. So I think a lot of times when you don't do a lot or
[00:40:14] you have been served or something like that, it's almost like free money. And you've been exposed
[00:40:19] to earning that money in the real sense. So that's, boom, that's constantly just in your nature now.
[00:40:28] And then, you know, other people they do have to be reminded, you know, and I think you know what,
[00:40:33] a powerful reminder because every day, and I would say every minute of every day,
[00:40:43] I'm thinking about those guys. And that, that's uh, that definitely pushes me and I don't want
[00:41:01] to let those guys down. Yeah. So in regards to the military, you know, officers entering
[00:41:18] spec ops or other elite scenarios, what advice would you have for them? You know, this is again,
[00:41:27] this is one of those questions that's come up. And I get this a lot because a lot of people that
[00:41:33] listen to Joe Rogan, a lot of people that listen to Tim Ferris, they're younger folks and they,
[00:41:39] they might be stepping into leadership position for the first time. And so we definitely got a lot of
[00:41:44] a lot of questions from military guys that are getting promoted, they're going to be promoted into
[00:41:49] leadership positions. And we get a lot of younger people that are stepping into the business world and
[00:41:55] they're stepping into leadership roles for the first time in those situations. And I think that um,
[00:42:02] and I would tell both the special operations folks and the folks in the business world,
[00:42:09] the same thing because as if anyone's listening to me at all or heard anything that I say or
[00:42:13] read the book, the leadership principles do not change regardless of his in business or
[00:42:17] in battle. The leadership principles stay the same. And so if you're new and you're up and coming,
[00:42:22] what do you do? How do you step up into that role? Number one, be humble. I know it's a theme.
[00:42:27] I sound like a broken record, but you everybody knows everybody's seen that cocky guy that walks in
[00:42:36] and thinks they're going to run everything and you just instantly disrespect that person. So how
[00:42:41] do you overcome that? You come in and you be humble. You respect people. You respect people. Regardless
[00:42:47] of what rank you are, regardless of whether you're making a ton more money than someone else. It doesn't
[00:42:53] matter. You treat everybody with respect. You treat them with respect and they're going to respect
[00:42:58] you. You listen to them. It means so much when when one of your people comes and talks to you
[00:43:06] and you sit down and say, okay, let me take some notes on what you're saying. That means so much to them.
[00:43:12] And sometimes people forget that. They forget what it means to look up and see the boss man.
[00:43:17] And they might blow a guy off or, hey, I don't have time for you right now. You've got to listen to
[00:43:23] people because what you're trying to do in a leadership position. And this is a word that
[00:43:30] I've only recently become comfortable saying. The word is relationships. You are truly,
[00:43:39] that's what that's what businesses. That's what life is. That's what businesses. That's what
[00:43:47] combat is. That's how you lead people in combat in business. You have relationships with them.
[00:43:53] Lafan, I talk about this all the time. You know, sure, I can give you an order if you're
[00:43:58] below me and rank and you might do it some of the time. But you're not going to, the people that
[00:44:04] really follow you that you have a relationship with you. Those guys will do anything for you.
[00:44:08] The guys that I worked with, the guys that worked for me were my subordinates. They do anything
[00:44:15] for me. And you know what? I would do anything for them. I would do anything for those guys.
[00:44:19] The guys that were in my task unit, it's guys were awesome. They were awesome guys. And I would do
[00:44:24] anything for those guys. I would give them anything. Anything. And they would do the same for me.
[00:44:30] Why? Because we had relationship. That was what we had. It wasn't because I would order them to
[00:44:35] do something that doesn't work. So you've got to build those relationships and how do you build
[00:44:40] relationships? How do you build relationships then? You build relationships by doing those things,
[00:44:46] by respecting people, by being humble, by listening. By telling them the truth, by having integrity
[00:44:53] and telling people the truth, you can't lie to people. And when I'm lying as a strong word,
[00:45:00] because I don't think people are generally lying to each other in regular basis. But people
[00:45:07] people use half truths and they chatted things and you can't do that. And people see right through it.
[00:45:15] And even if they don't know what the truth is, they know they're not getting the truth.
[00:45:19] So, you know, I was always with my guys. Okay, here's what's going on. Here's the problem.
[00:45:24] Here's what we screwed up. Here's what we need to do better. Here's the pressure I'm under from
[00:45:28] higher headquarters. Here's why I'm under this pressure. I'm not sugar coating it. I'm not trying
[00:45:34] to set something up to be different than what the reality is. If I'm getting told to do something
[00:45:41] that I don't believe in, okay? Now this is a tough one. If I'm getting told to do something,
[00:45:46] I don't believe in. I'm not going to go tell my guys, hey, I don't believe in this and we're going
[00:45:51] to do it anyways. No, no, no, no. If I don't believe in it, I got to figure out why we're doing it.
[00:45:55] And I'm going to say, okay, boss, I do not understand why we're doing this. I don't see how this
[00:45:59] is going to help us win the battle. So, so you need to explain this to me. So, I can explain it to
[00:46:03] my guys because I'm not going to go lie to them. I'm also not going to go down there and say, hey,
[00:46:07] we're doing this anyways or I'm not going to send people to do things that I don't believe in.
[00:46:13] We're all trying to win the war. My boss is trying to win the war. I'm trying to win the war.
[00:46:18] My guys are trying to win the war. So my boss is going to tell me do something that doesn't
[00:46:21] make sense and doesn't, isn't logical to win the war. So, I should believe in it. And if I don't,
[00:46:27] then I should question him. And those are those are the things that allow you to build relationships
[00:46:34] and will the topic of the night again ownership. If you take ownership when there's problems
[00:46:39] and you get them solved and then when things do go right, you pass that past the reward and the
[00:46:45] credit onto your boys, then that also helps you build those relationships. So, that's what I would tell
[00:46:53] a new leader in the business world or a card. If I should have said that one's like number one,
[00:46:59] or a card. Yeah. Dang, that's another thing that whole answer what you just said applies to.
[00:47:07] It's another thing that applies to everything. Even, you say as a leader,
[00:47:11] you know, with the chain of command and all your guys that works with your kids, your friends,
[00:47:21] or just even in general, like you know at the gym. If you're, I used to work with this guy.
[00:47:26] And he was the nicest guy. He was the nicest guy. He'd always have compliments, but
[00:47:32] you know the kind of compliments that are kind of too good. Like man, I don't know. Let's say I'm wearing a
[00:47:37] new shirt. Man, that shirt is fucking awesome. And then he said, but he... I've never been told that.
[00:47:44] You're gonna have to come up with a different album. But he would do that kind of, he would say,
[00:47:50] you know, give you compliments, but just overdo it a little bit too much. Just a little bit,
[00:47:53] just to step outside of the realm of it being believable. So, the kind of work, he's got man,
[00:47:58] that's awesome trick. And then he walked away with everything that nightclub and he'd come back
[00:48:02] like me. Man, that is an awesome shirt. You know, it's hard to believe, given what I know about this
[00:48:07] person, that you're that into your shirt. Right. Just for you. Exactly. Exactly.
[00:48:13] And that would be a thing if there was other indicators. Right. So, it's a whole persona. So,
[00:48:18] it takes that, it takes you being consistent and all these things that you're saying are honest and
[00:48:25] consistent about it. So, the point of your story is that you didn't build a relationship with
[00:48:30] the guy because you didn't trust him. Yes, exactly right. So, you don't win your saying,
[00:48:33] tell the truth, you know, if it's bad, you've got to tell the truth, you're not gonna say,
[00:48:37] this guy, literally it's almost like he would only want to tell you good news. So, it could be,
[00:48:44] like he could, it's almost like he had this feeling like, even if he hated my shirt,
[00:48:48] I thought it looked whack or something like that, he would, he would still, oh, that's a,
[00:48:53] that's a cool shirt. And you know, this brings me to another point. And that is balance.
[00:48:58] And then I talk about balance all the time because all these things have to be balanced. And when
[00:49:04] you're talking about truth right now, you have to be tactful, you know, being truthful and being honest,
[00:49:12] does not give you permission to be a jerk. It doesn't do that. And so, there's a difference between,
[00:49:19] you know, oh, I don't like echo shirt. So, I'm gonna say, dude, that's an ugly shirt, right?
[00:49:23] And just like in when you're working with, you know, subordinates and they screw something up,
[00:49:27] you know, you're, you know, that was a horrible job. You let me down. No, no, okay. Hey,
[00:49:33] well, first of all, you want to take ownership of it. Yeah, obviously, they didn't give you good enough guidance.
[00:49:36] But the, the point that I'm trying to make is being honest with people, there's people that are
[00:49:42] blunt honest leaders and everyone hates them because they're so blunt. They don't have any tact.
[00:49:48] They don't, they don't maneuver. They don't use jujitsu. They don't, they don't think and they don't
[00:49:54] assess the whole situation. And they think that if, if I tell echo, you know, if I want echo to use
[00:50:01] method A and echo's used to using method B, echo might have a personality that if I go up and say,
[00:50:07] hey, use method A now, I'm being blunt, I'm being frank. What does echo say to that? Echo's like,
[00:50:12] dude, I've been doing this a lot longer than you. I'm not gonna do method A. I'm sticking my method.
[00:50:16] That's real. I need to get, you know, so you've got to, you've got to influence people.
[00:50:21] You've got to be a chess player, not a checkers player. And so don't confuse being honest with being
[00:50:28] blunt and untaxful and adjirc. You have to do jujitsu. And for anyone that's listening that doesn't
[00:50:34] do jujitsu, jujitsu is a very nuanced game where you're constantly trying to set things up and shape
[00:50:43] the situation. It's not like boxing and boxing. I'm trying to punch you. You're trying to punch me.
[00:50:47] And jujitsu, you're trying to maneuver on the other person. You're trying to get better positions on
[00:50:51] them. You're trying to flank them and come in from a different direction that they didn't expect.
[00:50:55] That's what the art of leadership is. Anyone could go through a list of, hey, here's what you
[00:51:00] guys screwed up on the mission. One, two, three, four, five. Fix it. That guy's not going to be
[00:51:05] respect as a leader. Even though he's truthful and honest and blunt, it's not going to get him where
[00:51:10] he needs to be. There's a whole, another game to play with in. Yeah, and it's dealing with
[00:51:20] egos and it's dealing with personalities. That's really what it boils down to. Everyone has different
[00:51:24] personalities and learning how to be a craftsman that knows what tools to use with what different
[00:51:31] types of wood. That's what being a leader is. Yeah. If leadership was do these next seven things
[00:51:43] and you'll be a great leader, I wouldn't have a book and I wouldn't have a business because
[00:51:47] everyone would be a great leader. There is an art to it. It is a very difficult thing to do.
[00:51:53] It's simple. There are simple steps. You know, be honest. You know, show integrity, take ownership.
[00:51:59] There's those simple steps, but at the same time they're incredibly nuanced. That's what makes
[00:52:05] it challenging. That's what makes it so rewarding as well. That is absolutely what makes it so rewarding.
[00:52:19] People who don't take accountability. Don't take accountability.
[00:52:24] Play me in everyone else. How do you deal with people like that? And personally, how do you deal with them?
[00:52:35] Because I guess it would be the same way as you would professionally. Personally, it's all the same.
[00:52:39] These are the, these are questions that we get asked on a regular basis and we definitely got a lot of
[00:52:44] online. How do you deal with people that don't take accountability? How do you deal with leadership
[00:52:51] that doesn't get the message that you are communicating? Right? So just so we can both understand
[00:52:58] very out of the gate here. Both those questions. What do both those questions do?
[00:53:05] What this question? Both these two questions. They have something in common. How do you deal with people?
[00:53:10] People that don't take accountability and people that don't get the message that you're communicating?
[00:53:16] You're not taking accountability. It's your blaming these people. You're blaming them for not taking
[00:53:21] accountability. You're blaming them for not understanding your message. Who's fault is that?
[00:53:26] You're on a, if you take an extreme ownership, that's your fault. 100% of the time. So if I'm a leader
[00:53:31] and my people aren't taking responsibility for their actions, that's not their fault. It's my fault.
[00:53:36] I have not shown them how to lead properly. I haven't shown them how to take accountability.
[00:53:40] And how do you do that? Hey, you know, if echo does something wrong, I don't go echo. You screwed this up.
[00:53:47] I say echo. This went wrong. It's my fault that I didn't explain it to you well enough.
[00:53:52] I'm not going to talk to you, baby. But like, hey, you know, what do we do wrong? How do we not?
[00:53:56] How do we, how do we make this happen? You know, you've got to take ownership of it. And that's
[00:54:01] what does that make echo do? That makes echo say, oh, you know what? No, it was my fault. You know what I mean?
[00:54:08] So both those questions. How do I, how do I solve those problems? I take ownership of them. That's
[00:54:14] number one. Number two, what do I do? Because to take ownership of them is in quite enough here,
[00:54:20] we need to, we need to be smarter than that. We again, we need to play chess. So what I always try and
[00:54:25] do from a leadership perspective is I always try and understand the perspective that other people
[00:54:32] have. This kind of goes to detachment. I got to detach from my own head and I got to see it from
[00:54:37] their perspective. So I can understand what does it look like from Echoes viewpoint. What does it look like
[00:54:43] from my most junior guy that's not doing what I want to do? Why isn't he doing what is he singing
[00:54:49] from his perspective? What is it? Okay, my boss doesn't understand what I'm trying to communicate to him.
[00:54:54] Guess what? What is his perspective? How do I detach from my own head? See what his perspective is?
[00:55:00] Because once I see his perspective, I can adjust it. Right. So it's very important to try and
[00:55:05] understand other people's perspectives. And it's usually not that hard. People are often, you know,
[00:55:12] pretty easy to read. And as soon as you leave your own head and get into theirs, you'll see how
[00:55:18] you can change this scenario and make them understand it better. So those are two big pieces.
[00:55:26] Yeah, that's another one that applies to everything. And how you were saying these are simple steps
[00:55:35] but simple but not easy. Yeah, come on, man, to get out of your own head and you know,
[00:55:43] it's hard. It definitely is challenging. Especially in these pressure situations where
[00:55:47] situations where emotions are evolved and you start getting fired up, people are yelling orders,
[00:55:54] you know, capital at risk or jobs at risk or lives at risk. It's definitely hard to do that.
[00:56:00] And guess what? Those situations where it's hardest to do are the most critical times where you
[00:56:06] need to step back, calm down, step outside your own head. Don't see the emotions. Let your
[00:56:13] ego go. Understand other people's perspectives. That's when you need to do it the most. Yeah.
[00:56:19] Oddly enough. So what would you say is your most difficult day in the military or can you even
[00:56:29] single one out? And how did it affect you or shape you or you know, put you forward, you know,
[00:56:40] the time I was in the SIL Team for 20 years. And it was awesome. It was, I became
[00:56:50] even called a job because it was so fun and surrounded by great guys and even overseas. And I
[00:56:57] rack I was having an absolute fantastic time the whole time. The obviously those were the best
[00:57:06] days of my life being a combat leader in a combat situation. That's what I wanted to do my
[00:57:14] whole life and when I was there, I knew that and those were the best days of my life. And
[00:57:18] encompassed inside those great days are obviously the worst days of my life. And no doubt
[00:57:34] the worst days of my life were the days when my guys got killed. And Mark Re, first SIL killed an
[00:57:44] Iraq, Mikey Montsour, second SIL killed an Iraq who's posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor
[00:57:52] for jumping on a grenade to save three of her other teammates. And Ryan Job, who was severely
[00:58:00] wounded, blinded in both eyes after he was shot in the face who made it home. And eventually,
[00:58:09] after his 22nd surgery to repair the damage that would have done to his head and face, he died as well.
[00:58:21] And the day that was the absolute worst was when I came home from deployment. And I didn't have
[00:58:34] those guys with me. And I was coming home to my family, to my kids, to my wife, and they weren't.
[00:59:04] And how it affected me as far as my military career goes, I truly understood what was
[00:59:31] it's stake in combat. And when I took over training out on the west coast, I was obsessed
[00:59:46] with making the training as realistic as possible. And getting the guys that were going overseas
[00:59:55] to Iraq and Afghanistan, getting them as prepared as they could humanly possibly ever be to be in
[01:00:02] these worst case scenarios. And I remember, you know, I remember we'd set up these scenarios that were
[01:00:12] very, very difficult. I mean, unbelievably difficult. Like you were going to have massive challenges.
[01:00:19] And I remember I'd see a guy like, for instance, in an urban environment and training. I'd see
[01:00:27] a guy standing in the middle of the street, you know, like, which you would not want to do if you were
[01:00:32] in Ramadi in 2006. And I'd see, and I would get this feeling, I'd get this sick to my stomach feeling
[01:00:39] because, like in the back of my mind, I'm waiting for rounds to start hitting the ground and kill
[01:00:44] the sky or wound him and I would, you know, get fired up and you know, explain to him, listen,
[01:00:53] you can not, you got to move from cover to cover. Don't be standing under the street. There's no cover
[01:00:57] fire going on. And that's how it affected me as far as my military career and how it affected
[01:01:05] me in my life. You know, I've already told you how it affected me. Those guys, I'm trying to honor
[01:01:10] them by living the best life I can and taking advantage of the freedom that they bless me with.
[01:01:26] So, I'm going to go to the, yeah, another question from online here.
[01:01:34] Hmm, how'd you come to know the darkness and how does it motivate you
[01:01:42] dealing with it and using the light to win?
[01:01:48] Is this a Star Wars question?
[01:01:52] Kind of a fun, too, first part, because you're talking about the darkness and the light.
[01:01:56] I don't know about it. It's definitely something that I, it's definitely something that I think about,
[01:02:07] you know, and the world is in evil place and there's a lot of evil in the world. There's pain,
[01:02:18] there's suffering, there's disease, there's evil, there's war. I mean, there's bad things in the world.
[01:02:24] Yeah. And sometimes people ignore those things and, you know, we talked about this with Jill
[01:02:36] Rogan quite a bit, you know, we can live in a bubble here in America, whether almost is no pain
[01:02:42] and there almost is no suffering and there almost is no violence and there almost is no evil.
[01:02:46] And for some reason, I've always stepped outside that bubble and looked and seen what the rest of
[01:02:55] the world is like. And so I think that's a counter to what a lot of people believe the world is like.
[01:03:07] And so for me, that darkness is always present. It's always there.
[01:03:11] And at the same time, there is light. And there is people that are incredibly generous
[01:03:20] that sacrifice greatly that give everything they have to serve other people. Doctors,
[01:03:33] nurses, firefighters, there's all these people, teachers. I mean, there's just people that do all
[01:03:40] they can to help other people and, and to do good in the world. And so I think that's what I try and
[01:03:49] balance in my mind. And I don't want people to think that I sit around and brood all day about the
[01:03:58] darkness, you know, because I don't, you know, I mean, I love that a good time and laughing and,
[01:04:07] you know, smile and I want to do that, you know. But I also, in those moments, I'm definitely thinking
[01:04:15] that, you know, we're lucky to be here. Yeah, and doesn't that make like, you know, I don't know,
[01:04:20] a day where you're just kind of cruising to whatever and, you know, looking for a laugh or whatever,
[01:04:24] and hanging with your friends or whatever. Doesn't don't those days seem a lot more enjoyable when you do have
[01:04:30] the darkness in mind, you know, where even, I mean, you know, your kids, so let's, I don't know,
[01:04:38] your daughter spills the milk and laughs about it. Right. If you know what the rest of the
[01:04:47] world is like, that's going to seem almost enjoyable. That's funny. That's cute. You can recognize
[01:04:54] you. All the great things about that little moment. It's a lot easier to recognize the great things
[01:04:59] about that little. Exactly. If you understand, if you think that, yeah, the world's all hunky
[01:05:03] Dorian milk's never supposed to be spilled and, you know, all this stuff and everything's perfect
[01:05:07] and sweet and that's kind of your mindset and all they spilled the milk, that's a disruption.
[01:05:13] And you're like, yeah, that's your dot, but yeah, that's my dot sure. You know, I see my daughter
[01:05:17] every single day, you spilled the milk. That's a disrupt. You know, so it's kind of that, that, that,
[01:05:22] you know, without hardship, there can be no pleasure kind of contrast that kind of,
[01:05:28] it's brought out more, huh? No doubt about it. No doubt about it.
[01:05:36] I say everyone's in a while, uh, you'll hear people going, man,
[01:05:42] like this country is going like violence or whatever, you know, like going down the
[01:05:46] jitter or all this stuff. And you kind, if you think about it and
[01:05:52] let's say you're normal day, maybe not you, but probably you too, you're normal day. If you,
[01:05:58] let's say you got up, you worked out, you went to the store. Like, let's say, oh, I want to get a
[01:06:02] pomegranate, wait, T yet. 70 left. And you go in your sunny and limon, the guy in front of you
[01:06:08] gets into a heated argument with a cash, guy, the cashier. And it starts swearing at them and
[01:06:16] like, oh, you, I don't like these prices yelling, just yelling at them. And I can use a get out of here
[01:06:22] and you know, anything's right, screw this place using profanity, get some card speeds away.
[01:06:27] Right. Didn't break any laws, just that happened right in front of you. You, I would, we would probably
[01:06:33] remember that for a while. All it was was a yelling mess. It's not it was no violence, no laws being
[01:06:38] broken, no, no, no physical, anything. Just the argument between two people and some disrespect.
[01:06:44] Some disrespect. Exactly. You remember that. That would, that would be a significant incident
[01:06:52] in your day. That's how good the world is or your environment. That's how good this country is.
[01:06:58] Yeah. You know, of course, you know, that we're talking about a spectrum here. You go in certain
[01:07:02] areas. It's going to be a little worse. But keep in mind, like, in our environment, I know here in San Diego,
[01:07:08] that's essentially how it is most of the time. If you see two people, almost get in a fight,
[01:07:13] that's a significant event right there. Yeah. So overall would say, there's a lot of light around
[01:07:20] here. There's a lot of light. You know, so I think that if you think about, and you've been
[01:07:26] exposed to it, so dang, you can really have a, have an accurate perspective. The light is very
[01:07:34] noticeable. You know, if you can, if you can constantly have that contrast and know it,
[01:07:38] you know, there's no doubt about that. When, when do you see you go get in the way? Like,
[01:07:49] when is it most prevalent, do you think it's so prevalent every three? And this is, uh,
[01:07:57] when I saw this question, I immediately thought of, um, this guy who's ego just completely got in
[01:08:05] the way and he was able to fix it on this particular situation. And it was me. So, so this is actually
[01:08:13] a funny story. This guy, so we, uh, we started working with a company and the company,
[01:08:20] had a pretty young CEO and he was a super smart guy and he had played football in college,
[01:08:27] a suit, you look D1 football player, just a pretty bad ask guy, super smart, super articulate.
[01:08:36] And when I met him, I, I like, there was a little tension between him and me. There was a little
[01:08:44] something, there was a little tension. And I'm looking at this guy and I'm like, this guy really thinks
[01:08:51] he's a bad ass. And, and so we, we go through a meeting and we go through another meeting and
[01:08:58] there's just this tension. I'm going, yeah, this guy is definitely, he's got issues. He's got problems,
[01:09:04] looking this guy. And I can feel it come from him that he's thinking the same thing.
[01:09:10] Are you sure? Are you the thing in the same thing? I'm positive.
[01:09:13] Does he look in the mirror again? I'm positive. He's thinking the same thing. I'll tell you how.
[01:09:17] How I know that. So as I'm said there, so we actually did, did like a whole like two days with this company.
[01:09:23] And then we were coming back. And the next time we came back, I go, what's going to be like,
[01:09:27] this one I have this again, this guy, this asshole. I come back and, sure enough,
[01:09:34] there it is. I see him and he's like looking at him and he's looking at me and there's tension
[01:09:39] and all of a sudden I saw I detached from the situation and I looked at myself and I said,
[01:09:48] Jaco, you're an idiot because here I was and what was I thinking? I was jealous of the guy
[01:09:56] or, yeah, intimidated or jealous of it. First whatever the word threatened, I was jealous. I think it was
[01:10:01] jealous because he was a young guy that had been very successful made a ton of money.
[01:10:06] Yeah, we went to a big school and played ball and all that stuff and he had done all this stuff.
[01:10:14] And what was he thinking? He was looking at me thinking, oh this guy, he was a seal and he was,
[01:10:20] you know, a duet to guy and he's a badass and both of us were basically
[01:10:26] envious of the other one in some way and really what it was. I guess envious of the wrong
[01:10:30] word, our egos, both of our egos had impacted. And so as soon as I realized that,
[01:10:39] I was like bam, I immediately changed my attitude and I was like, and the next opportunity I had,
[01:10:45] you know, during a break or something, I was like, you know what? After working with you a couple of days,
[01:10:49] you're you're awesome. I said, what you've done is badass to be your age and be dominating
[01:10:55] and company like this and have raised it together and built it. That's awesome and made a ton of money.
[01:11:02] I love that. That's just badass man. I have nothing but respect for you and what you've done.
[01:11:08] And I actually want to learn from you all, I'm here. And immediately it was like a force field
[01:11:14] came down and he said to me, you know what? No matter what I've done in my life,
[01:11:20] it's never going to be what you've done. And after that we were broke, but I had to recognize
[01:11:27] the ego in the situation, mine and his and I just had to disarm it and then it was all gone.
[01:11:33] So it's a story about ego, my big ugly ego. And again, ego, you know, ego drives people to
[01:11:41] make people want to be successful and it has a lot of positives to it. But it can definitely get in the
[01:11:48] way. Yeah. You recognize that story. I mean, you realize like how that happens. Yeah.
[01:11:58] Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Fully, especially when you can see,
[01:12:03] man, I can't remember the exact words of how they, I forget even where I saw it. But it was
[01:12:09] your threatened typically by something along the lines of if someone is like capable or there's
[01:12:19] these things that people have to be in your eyes that makes them threatening to you. So what kind of
[01:12:25] put real loosely, when you see someone who is essentially you, you're going to feel threatened.
[01:12:32] And it doesn't have to be you like they're the same height as you, or the same race as you,
[01:12:36] in that act. There's some kind of equivalency that entends you in a lot of that intimidate your ego.
[01:12:41] Yeah. So if you get someone who's let's say you're kind of built, like you for example,
[01:12:46] if someone's kind of built, boom, that's one thing. If he's around your save, age, it kind of depends
[01:12:52] because it can be if there are a functioning able adult, put it that way. I'm so guy.
[01:12:58] Kind of your built, boom, boom, boom, boom. Those are all these other things that it's
[01:13:02] live like dogs and it's funny to see like it happened like especially at the gym. When someone
[01:13:07] a new guy walks in and he's kind of built, watch everyone's eyes go to, you know, like ears pop up.
[01:13:13] Yes, fine. And yeah, that goes everywhere. Business world. You know, girls have a bad man.
[01:13:18] My experience for a little nissy. I don't know. I don't know what they see other girls. You know?
[01:13:24] Yeah. With that that. Yeah. It's funny. Do you want to go, uh, do you want to go over these as well?
[01:13:31] You know what? I think I, I think I, from my, coming from myself. Okay. But anyway, where do you
[01:13:39] you say? Proceed with your questions. Okay. So, um, conspiracy theories, right? You know,
[01:13:49] how, um, you know, people, they'll, they'll go into the, certain conspiracy. Right.
[01:13:55] I also, or in 9, 11, the inside job or recently the, um, the San Bernardino shootings like that was,
[01:14:03] you know, what they're saying, the government staged it or whatever. Um, do you ever engage
[01:14:12] with people about conspiracy theories? I haven't engaged with anyone about conspiracy theories.
[01:14:20] So, do you, when you hear like a new, for example, okay, if you're, you're not really on Facebook,
[01:14:25] but, um, we'll just say online, you can see people expressing their opinions about the conspiracy
[01:14:35] theories that they believe it. Um, and they're really overt us. Let's say, for example, someone
[01:14:45] expresses their feelings about a certain conspiracy theory to you. Do you, on what level do you
[01:14:54] entertain that? Not very much. Just kind of across the board? Yeah, not very much across the board.
[01:15:02] I'm not trying to convert people and make people think things and, um, and, and I'm definitely
[01:15:13] not going to expand a bunch of energy diving into things that are, not worth diving
[01:15:24] into. Yeah. Um, you know, with conspiracy theories, you can tie anything to anything.
[01:15:36] If you want to, I mean, any major global occurrence that's happening will be tied into the
[01:15:43] rest into some way to craft macaroni and cheese. I mean, there will be a connection to craft
[01:15:51] macaroni and cheese if you dig deep enough. There'll be an employee. There'll be a purchase. There'll be a
[01:15:56] plant. There'll be a farm. There'll be a, there'll be a sales. There'll be a stock. There'll be some
[01:16:01] connection between that and whatever incident that happened on the globe. And if you want to formulate
[01:16:08] those and tie those pieces together, you can do it because the world is connected. And when people say,
[01:16:14] oh, this corporation was involved in some way with this incident in this war taking place.
[01:16:24] You say, well, yes, you know, there are big giant corporations that have huge interests around the
[01:16:31] world. And they're going to protect those interests. And that's what the world is made of.
[01:16:36] So, I don't do a lot of debating about conspiracy theories. No.
[01:16:45] There you go. Somebody sent me a link to like a
[01:16:51] video about 9-11 and I clicked on it. And it was something like eight hours long.
[01:16:58] The video was eight hours long about, you know, and I just thought, well, okay, you know, again,
[01:17:09] if you want to, you can connect anything to anything if you want to. That's the way the global
[01:17:16] world is, the global economies. It's the way things are. Did you watch the whole video?
[01:17:22] I watched until I saw it's at eight hours.
[01:17:32] I know we got some questions. Questions about blood meridian. I think that those
[01:17:43] that book, which is obviously a very powerful book, it's, I think we got to save that for the next podcast.
[01:17:50] I know we got quite a few questions about Chris Kyle. And, you know, people want to know
[01:18:00] if I knew Chris, if I worked with Chris, and the answer is yes, Chris Kyle was the
[01:18:11] lead sniper and point man in Charlie Patoon, which was Lave Babbins. He was the the officer
[01:18:17] and charge of that Patoon. And that was in Task Unit, Brusher, which I was the commander of. So we absolutely,
[01:18:25] you know, knew Chris and worked alongside Chris. Lave was on every mission for all practical
[01:18:34] purposes that Chris was on. And, you know, I, you know, Lave and I spoke at Chris's memorial service
[01:18:44] in Calboy Stadium. I mean, it's, so yes, we, we know Chris very well. And at some point, we'll,
[01:18:55] I'll get Lave on here and we'll, we'll talk about Chris, Tom, and tell some stories about Chris that
[01:19:01] would, you know, provide a perspective that may not have been seen in the, the portrayals that
[01:19:07] I've been given so far. So I think we, we need to hold off on that one and maybe just do one more question here.
[01:19:16] Do you have any friends that aren't,
[01:19:21] well, that aren't military and that are not duty to or MMA guy? Yes, I do. I do mostly musicians.
[01:19:30] I should say, most of the musicians. Surfers. I got some, I got quite a few friends that are
[01:19:35] that surf. I surf and out here in California. And, uh, and I got some friends that play music and,
[01:19:43] you know, we, we rock and roll. Yeah, and that's something that I actually forgot. I knew you
[01:19:51] thought, I was saying you knew that you surf, but that you played guitar. Yes. Would you like
[01:19:57] to put band or something? Yeah, I was in bands by whole life when I was growing up and I was a kid.
[01:20:01] Yeah, it's funny, like a lot of successful people or people who, you know, they always have all
[01:20:09] these skills. Yeah. And what's interesting is that, like surfing and playing guitar, like that's not
[01:20:17] easy, you know, it's not, I mean, I'm not going to, I'm not going to talk about golf, but golf is
[01:20:23] seems like, oh, hey, you just go out and play golf and show some people they get good and great,
[01:20:27] you know, and it is fun and stuff, but it's not like surfing, you know, and surfing is fun and
[01:20:34] maybe I'm really, there's a little bit more of a physical challenge. Yeah, some more of it,
[01:20:38] and a challenge and a challenge that it shows when you are good at surfing or not good at
[01:20:45] surfing shows, you know, seemingly, I don't know, I guess that's just my opinion, but it's always
[01:20:50] interesting, like the play guitar, sure. Yeah, black belt and jeez. What's interesting
[01:20:55] is too, and these are some other, like I know some guys that are surfers and musicians and artists,
[01:21:04] and I want to bring some of those guys and talk to them because they have different
[01:21:08] outlooks on things and how to get good and what kind of discipline it takes and what drives them.
[01:21:14] I mean, you know, like you said surfing is challenging, surfing is cold, it's wet, it's dark,
[01:21:18] it's sketchy sometimes, and guys that do that their whole life, until they're
[01:21:24] seven to your 80 years old, that's pretty awesome. Yeah. We're on, we're at, um, so, so one more.
[01:21:36] Okay, yeah, last question, we'll, um,
[01:21:44] the time you wake up in the morning and why do you wake up at that time and what do you think about?
[01:21:53] Well, we, we talked about what time I wake up in the morning, but I think this last question is
[01:22:00] here, what do you think about before you go to bed at night? And, and really to me, I mean,
[01:22:08] to kind of close this out is the last question of, what do you tell people or what do I think?
[01:22:16] I think is most, is it, is it helpful, kind of lessons learned to close on?
[01:22:24] And I think one, one conversation I had with one of my, one of my guys, um, who is just a complete,
[01:22:34] awesome warrior, named JP and JP, how you doing, brother out there.
[01:22:41] Um, when we were going through training to get ready for Iraq and when you're, when you're going
[01:22:50] through steel training, you get, you learn, you learn all this information and they teach you all these
[01:22:54] things and you layer them on top of your brain and there's layers and layers and layers of these
[01:23:02] tactics and techniques and procedures and the layers can get so thick that you lose contact with
[01:23:11] the ground. And so we were out in training and I was looking at JP who is a stud and it was
[01:23:22] one of those situations where we're out in the desert but there's rocks and there's little shrubs and
[01:23:26] all that and he was standing up in the wide open because he was staying in the formation of the
[01:23:34] patrol, the way that he was taught and the way that he had been indoctrinated is one of those
[01:23:38] layers as you're here and you stand here and this is your field of fire and you watch this area
[01:23:44] but what he had forgotten was that you're standing in the middle of an open area. Don't stand there,
[01:23:51] move to this little rock and then move to this little shrub and then move this little so that
[01:23:54] way if a bad guy looks he's not going to see you and if he does see you he starts shooting you
[01:23:58] have a place to hide and I said to him I said JP, my brother, he's like, what's up sir? I said hey man
[01:24:08] if you were 10 years old right now and we were out playing army out here, would you stand in
[01:24:13] the middle of this open trench right here? Would you stand here? And he's like, no,
[01:24:19] I said where would you stand? He said I'd go over there to that rock right there and I'd get
[01:24:24] behind that and I said so you're 10 year old brain is doing better job moving from cover to cover
[01:24:33] then you're 23 year old brain and I said listen you're instincts you know what the right
[01:24:40] thing to do is you know what it is do it and he did and it was amazing and and I think that people
[01:24:51] you me everyone people listening people that communicate with us you know what the right thing to do is
[01:25:00] you know what it is you know it's be disciplined you know it's work hard you know it's put your ego and
[01:25:07] check you know these things you just got to do you just got to do I think we're close that
[01:25:21] with that yeah so thanks to everybody for joining and we had a bunch of people on the
[01:25:28] on periscope that was pretty cool to watch and we'll see how this one goes and we'll do some more
[01:25:36] in the near future yeah I like the idea that people are really engaged with you online and
[01:25:44] and they'll ask you questions and you'll essentially confirm like check that that's a good
[01:25:51] question kind of thing you're engaging I think that's a good thing because these are real questions
[01:25:57] it's not like questions and we just thought up no that's a great question so yeah so I would say
[01:26:02] to yet encourage that to you know for people if they're wondering about stuff because this is
[01:26:08] in my experience everything that you've even said before this and even just stuff you said to me
[01:26:12] personally what it's all like it's really useful stuff and not just in business it applied the
[01:26:18] concepts I'll play it pretty much everything in life functioning in life if you can function with
[01:26:23] these concepts that you're gonna you're gonna do good it'll be kind of on you if you don't
[01:26:27] nothing to take that extreme all awesome all right thanks everybody for joining appreciate it we'll talk to you next time out here
