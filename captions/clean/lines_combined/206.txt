00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 206 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:22.000 And back for a third time is Henry Dick Thompson. I have to throw Henry in there just to make sure when people look for your book they'll be able to find it.
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:34.000 So Dick Thompson, Sawgwarger, was on podcast 203 and 204. If you haven't listened to those, just go and listen them immediately.
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000 And you'll realize the magnitude of the fact that this individual is sitting here alive talking to me is just an absolute miracle.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:57.000 So go listen to 203 204 where you can hear about Dick's experiences as a Sawg team leader and team member in Vietnam.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:10.000 Where we left off was home from Vietnam and now checking in as a Ranger instructor, which for you was a great deal because you were going to have the opportunity to take.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And then you listened to the Rangers and also home them for your own experience because you figured you were eight months away from going back to Vietnam.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000 Yes. So this was my opportunity to get ready. And so I could be more focused next time. I could do a better job.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000 Now when you said eight months, what was that based on? What was that when you say I was probably going back over in eight months? What was that based on?
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:50.000 At that time, that was about to turn around right. You come back from Vietnam. They give you a little time to recover and you know, eight months or so you're going to get orders to go back again.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And you're now, did you make captain yet? Or are you still?
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000 Yeah. I'm like captain.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000 So now you made captain.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.000 You must be looking around at the guys that you deployed with and that you knew. I mean, you must be missing a lot of guys now. I mean, wounded, killed or missing an action. This has got to be just a tremendous number for you.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000 When I look at the ones that that I knew that I consider teammates. I mean, we did things together.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:42.000 We knew each other. I have a list that I run for 35 names. Those are just the ones that I considered. You know, my personal friends and teammates. Now, seeing in. We lost a lot more people than that. I just, I didn't know them very well.
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000 But just the time I was there, you know, I got 35 names. I run for.
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:01.000 And you got to have that in your back of your mind when you're training these young Rangers. You know what they're getting into. Even if it's not saw. You know, you want to prepare them to the best of your ability for what they're going to face.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000 Yeah, because I knew at that time, I mean, that's, they were going to be at nine.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000 I mean, there was no, no doubt, especially if they made it through the Rangers school.
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:28.000 I mean, they were going to the question for me was, in addition to the personal things that I wanted to do, like, you know, improve my skills. What could I do for these guys to help them have a higher chance of surviving once they get there.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:42.000 So I kind of made that my mission. So you got, you got the normal instruction from a Ranger instructor plus.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000 Then I added other things on it. And I said, you got to do this. We're not going to do this. This is how you talk business. I lead.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000 So they got a lot of extra coaching and training whenever I led their group. And I just, I felt responsible to do that.
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000 What were some of the leadership principles that you focused on teaching the young Rangers?
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:23.000 Some of it was, you know, you got to be accountable. These are your guys. You got to be accountable. You got to take responsibility. If you're going to lead them, you got to make sure you know what you're doing. You got to be physically fit. You got to be mentally fit. You need to know the tactics techniques.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:35.000 You need to be done for some. You need to encourage them. You need to build a team. You need to take care of them. You need to know everybody on your team. If you've got to put tune, you need to know everybody in the put town.
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.000 And at that time, the army used to do issue a little green notebook pocket size notebook hardback that you put in your pocket.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000 You know, every town, you need to have your people in here. You know, in peace time, you need to know who they are. Know something about them.
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000 So you can relate to them when they're having problems and how to train them, you know, the best. Know what their weak areas are. How you can build them up.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:15.000 Because you're accountable for them. There you are, people. And you're the guy that's the leader. You need to be the first one out there. And, you know, for me, I'm not going to ask you to do something I want to.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:27.000 I'm not going to go to you and say, pop out the door there playing here. If I'm not going to do it, you know, I tend to do more of follow me.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:37.000 You know, I'm going out there. I'm going to do it too. And I'm going to set the example for you. This is how I want you to do it.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.000 And so you're trying to get that through to them and trying to get through in terms of think of yourself as a professional.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000 Think about your medical doctor.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Every day you should be reading, learning, studying, getting better. Every technique that you know, you should be trying to improve it. Every day is about practice.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Whatever it is that you're doing, ask you, is there somebody else better than you than you need to be practicing?
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:21.000 You know, you got to get as good as the best because you want to be that person. And you don't get there by just wishing, hoping. You got to get out and take the action.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000 Some of the things that you're going to be doing, particularly if we think, Ranger, special forces, seal.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000 A lot of stuff to mind set. Some mind set. You've got to think like that.
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000 You can be in the greatest physical condition in the world. But if you don't have the mindset, you can't do it.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000 And you guys are already seeing here in Ranger's go, how many of your buddies have already dropped out?
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000 When I went through Ranger's go, we started out with 248 people.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000 When we finished, we had 175 actually make it to the end of the course.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:12.000 75 of those got a Ranger down. Rust them didn't. So they only 75 Rangers, you know, produced. And it was mindset.
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000 It wasn't that they were bigger, stronger, faster. They had the mental capacity to keep going on one meal a day, three hours, sleep at night,
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:33.000 keep pushing and still be able to think cognitively enough to put together a good tactical plan to communicate that plan and execute that plan.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And it takes work. And you need to be the leader. So people follow you.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000 So, you know, whatever it is that I'm going to do out there that I expect you to do, I want to be doing it to the most of my ability.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000 If you're going to jump out of an airplane with a rope tied onto you to pull the parachute out, I'm going out from 30,000 feet.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000 Hey, law.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:08.000 And that's what I do. If you have to have a landing on the size of a football field to get into, I'll cut it down to a third of that and do it in a dark.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000 You know, I want you to say it can be done better. And if you can beat me, more power to you.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000 Because now what you've done is tell me, I need to practice more. But you're going to make a word for it.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000 Yeah.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.000 Yeah.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000 That's the part that you said about being a professional and when I talk to young seals or young marines or soldiers or airmen, sailors, whoever, you know,
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000 I always say, I always say, you're a professional. And then I tell, this is your life.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 This right here is your life.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Everything else is secondary to what you're doing right here. And you need to study, you need to learn, you need to read, you need to practice, you need to rehearse, and you need to do that all the time, because you're never going to be good enough.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000 And you need to make this right here your life.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000 You got a couple other notes in here.
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000 One of them just says, staff sergeant, Shelley.
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000 What's that all about?
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:19.000 When I went through rangers go in the mountain phase, there was an African American ranger instructor there called Sergeant Shelley.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Hardcore.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000 Hardcore did rarely to leave pass anyone on patrol.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000 And I had him, he graded me one time on my pass.
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000 When I came back from Vietnam and went to the ranger department, I ended up in the mountains, he ended up on my team.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000 So now I've got the famous Sergeant Shelley on my team.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000 I thought, man, this is cool.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000 We go on a patrol where I'm grading a patina leader. He's grading a patina sergeant.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:04.000 It's 18 degrees outside. Shelley shows up, which he got his fatigue showed on, but he's got his sleeves rolled up.
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000 And he said, where's your Parker?
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000 I don't know how to Parker. Where are your gloves? I don't need gloves.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000 It's 18 degrees.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000 He said, okay. I'm fine. Hard, dude.
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000 And then we're out on patrol. The snow is almost in the ED.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000 Greg and the rangers threw it. They're tired. They're cold.
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000 And so I call the next patrol leader. Next person's just going to take over the patina.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 And I say, all right, Ranger.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000 Take after him out.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000 And I want you to show me 10 digit coordinates to where we're standing right now, because you've got to know where you're starting from.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000 And he kind of looks at me and I said, take your map out.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000 I don't have a map, sir. Why don't you have a map?
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000 He said, well, Sergeant Shelley took my map when we stopped back there and we had to go ahead, man, because of the guy getting a frostbite.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000 He took my map. We didn't go and Sergeant Shelley to give you a map back. Tell him you did it.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000 I can't do that. That's why not.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000 So, sorry, he built a fire with my map.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000 I said, okay, then you need to find somebody here that's going to loan your map.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000 You're going to be the patrol leader. You got to have a map.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Back then, you could do a lot of things that you can't do now.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.000 Sergeant Shelley would take onions, cut them in half, rub them all over.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000 He would eat garlic. He would take in some Kentucky fried chicken with him and the bag.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000 And so when it was dark and the reindeer students, you only had to feed them once every three days back then.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000 They put got to call them resupplies. They didn't get any food.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000 Or if they called them for resupplies and they didn't ask for food, they just got ammunition.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 So they were always hungry.
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000 And you get under a poncho at night.
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000 And it's actually, all right, Andrew, show me where we are on the map.
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000 And the ranger would start to pour out where we're at.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000 And nobody under the poncho can breathe.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000 You know, Shelley smells so bad. You just seconded her breath, her eyes are watering.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000 And the gas starts to pour out the water. They are on the map.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000 And he drops his chicken leg on his finger.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000 He says, don't you touch that chicken leg.
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 Don't you dare lick your finger.
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000 Now, show me where you are.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000 And he do things like that to him all the time.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 And he was, he would very good.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000 But he would very hard.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000 And then as I started to develop a similar reputation,
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000 they would hear about it for bending.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000 And when they got to the mountain face and Shelley and I would walk in to take over the patrol
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 for the next 24 hours.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000 And we did introduce ourselves. You could see the looks on their face.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000 Well, no. One's bad enough. We got both of them at the same time.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 No one's going to pass.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000 But yeah.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000 That I mean, Shelley is super guy.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000 Really smart.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000 And got another name down here. Bob Howard.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000 Bob Howard, Medal of Honor winner.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000 He was sawed down at the contume.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000 And wounded like 13 times eight purple hearts.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000 He was a tough guy.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000 And he came up in a fluvial recline with us one time.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And I had already heard some things about him.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000 I thought, man, I'm kind of nervous about getting an helicopter with him.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000 Because, I mean, he just draws boards.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000 I mean, I'm sure he's going to save most of us.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000 But you know, I might not be one. He's the hard dude.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000 And then he came to Granger School when I was an instructor.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000 So I liked him. He came through Ranger School.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000 Yeah. So he came back from Sog.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000 And it was coming through Ranger School.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000 And I ended up grading him.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000 You know, sign him.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000 How many did I?
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000 I did a great job.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000 But he was a hard dude.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000 And then we went to the infantry officer at Vance Course.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000 He was the, the, the, a company commander of my class.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000 You know, so we were there for a year together like that.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000 You know, he didn't believe in foul language.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000 You got to clean your language up if you were in his organization.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Did a lot of things.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000 You know, he was promoted to captain.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000 And retired as a full kernel.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000 I ran to here at Vance School for a while.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000 I did all, it's all kinds of things.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:03.000 But you know, he in 11 months he was put in for the Medal of Honor three times.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:08.000 Got it. Got it once. Got, you know, the DFCs for the other.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000 A warrior.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000 At one time, he was, I think he was the most decorated person on active duty.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000 And then, you know, after him, I mean, he got cancer.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000 And passed away. And then I think, um,
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000 Bargewell kind of took over as a most decorated for a while.
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000 So hardcore, song guy.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000 So at what point did you decide this is going to be your career?
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000 Have you already decided that or you still thinking, well, I'll do another tour of Vietnam or
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000 Yeah, I'm in, you know, yearning.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000 But the time I got to was.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000 I mean, you know, what would I do if I got out?
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Yeah, well, I want to go do some other things.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000 And the interim, I'll do the, the Ranger stuff to get ready to come back.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000 I'll do another tour here.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000 And then figure out, you know, where I go from, you know,
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000 Sog.
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000 So now it's 1970.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000 All right.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And are you seeing the war wind down yet?
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000 Or not really.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000 It's still still going pretty strong from where I am.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000 So I'm still expecting to get orders anytime.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000 And, you know, that happened.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000 But before that happened, I was,
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000 I got a call from Dick Meadows one day.
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000 And he said, this is me.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000 I can't tell you anything.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000 It's out.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000 You're going to get orders.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000 And you really want to do this.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 I need you.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000 Click.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000 So then I got orders to go somewhere on temporary duty.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Another kind of Ranger department got it.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000 And Meadows was in the Ranger department at the time.
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000 And he'd already been moved out on temporary duty for some reason.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000 And then two more of us get orders like that.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000 The Ranger department commander said,
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000 What's going on?
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000 Somebody better tell me what's going on.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000 I was just wondering about what was going on.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000 They canceled our orders.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000 Mine and the other guy.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Because of the security.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000 They didn't want people asking questions about something.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000 It might be going on.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000 So several months later,
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000 that was the raid and to North Vietnam and to San Te.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000 To the POW count.
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000 So, you know, I had been picked for that.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000 And, you know, just didn't get to go.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000 Unbelievable mission.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000 Probably one of the most successful missions we ever had.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000 Except no, no prisoners.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000 Right.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000 They had just been moved.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000 But the training, the knowledge and stuff that came out of that.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 And the way those guys trained.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000 And you know, having to build the POW count every night.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000 And the darkness.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000 So they could practice on it.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000 Because they're doing the same thing.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000 So they could practice on it.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000 Because they'd turn the Russians out of light.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000 Could see it.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000 So you had to time all of that stuff.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000 And then talking about practice.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000 Once they figured out how they were going to do the mission.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000 They practiced the mission over 170 times.
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000 And it took a long time to do a mission.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000 So it was the most of the night.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000 And they were just every day.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000 Every night they'd go practice that mission.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000 And you know, training during a day with their skills.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000 Everybody knew their job.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000 I mean, one of the guys when they landed in the compound.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000 One of the guys job was to take out a guard tower.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000 And the helicopter was going to land.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000 And he had a certain number of steps to run to to get down behind a big tree that was there.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000 And then use that as cover while he took out the guard tower.
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 He got a helicopter lands.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000 He runs over, gets down, kneels down, starts firing, taking out the guards up there.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000 And then something says, hey dude, there's no tree here.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000 Where's your tree?
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000 And it had been cut down.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000 But he was right where he was.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000 But if the tree had been there, he was in the right place.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000 He had rehearsed it so many times.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000 And all the stuff was like that.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000 You know, you got digmettos out there doing his thing.
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000 So anyway.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Then when did you get orders to go back?
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000 I'd been there about eight months.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000 And I got orders to go back.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000 I had actually signed out and was starting to go on leave.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000 I was going to go there three days a leave before you have to go.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000 And then I got orders revoked in those orders.
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000 Because at that time to be an instructor in a range of department,
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000 you had to have combat experience.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000 And they're running out of people with, particularly officers with combat experience,
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000 because they're getting out.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000 So they put an operational hole on myself.
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000 And I think about three or four other guys that said, no, you're not going anywhere.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000 You're going to stay right where you are.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000 Keep doing what you're doing.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000 So I was already set to go back to go to Sog.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000 Everything's set up.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000 And then they say, no, you're going to remain in place.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000 So how long did you end up staying as a Ranger instructor?
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000 A little over three years.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Yeah, long time.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000 And now you definitely are seeing the war wind down.
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000 I'm seeing the war wind down.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000 I'm seeing the protest.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000 I'm seeing a lot of different things now.
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000 But still very, you know, proud to be in the military, proud to be a Ranger,
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 especially forces and whatever.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 So I'm not thinking about getting out now.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000 And you got married sometime around this time, Frank?
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:13.000 That deal was confirmed right after I got orders revoking the trip back to Vietnam.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000 So, yeah, that's how I got married.
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000 You got confirmed.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Yeah.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000 Yeah, because what I had said was it would probably be better.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Let me do the tour.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000 And when I come back, you know, then we can get married.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000 Rather than, you know, something happening to me.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000 And you become in a widow and all that kind of stuff.
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000 Let's not do that.
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000 But once my orders were revoked, then okay, now we can move forward.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000 And then your next tour was went to Korea?
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Yes.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000 Well, I went to the advanced course down at Benning for a year and went from there to Korea.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000 What do you do with the after-off course course course course?
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000 Yeah.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000 And that's to prepare you to be a company commander?
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000 Company commander or, yeah, really, start moving you out toward the next level.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000 If you're going to get promoted, you know, you got to go to the advanced course.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000 And that's one of the Bob-I, where you stay on there.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000 There are some other people from Saag that I knew there.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000 And with an interesting to see the guys like the guys from Saag, the guys from special forces,
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000 in there, now they're teaching the company commanders for infantry.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:37.000 What kind of, what kind of lessons we're going back and forth from those two elements?
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000 You know, when you're being there, I learned a lot about, you know, just to mechanize units and things like that.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000 You know, because I had never been in one.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000 I've been in, you know, some kind of special ops group.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000 I didn't understand about people outside of special ops.
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000 I didn't understand about someone that you could say, okay, we got to get this accomplished this afternoon.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000 And so I did drones. And this afternoon I go, look, and it's not done.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000 What? How could that happen?
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 I mean, you tell a special ops guy, I mean, this needs to be done.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000 I mean, it was a different mindset, different.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000 I'm not trying to demean anybody that wasn't in special ops, but it's a different mindset.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000 So getting used to that when I got to Korea, I had, well, ahead of time, I had a lot of things.
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000 I had a time I had written a letter to the commanding general.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000 I found out I was going to the second after division.
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000 And he was probably else I.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000 So I had written a letter to him and said, you know, I'm coming.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000 I want to command a company, but I want to command a Ranger company.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000 I think the second after division could benefit from a position or Ranger company.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000 So what I'd like to do is take over a company and let me convert it.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000 And, you know, if anything happens with North Korea, I'm out there.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000 You know, you put us on there first and we'll go do it.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:21.000 And the created a lot of controversy with the staff and other people that found out that I had written a commanding general letter.
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000 And in fact, in the battalion, that was assigned to, there was a couple of weeks there before I got to take over the company.
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000 The battalion commander brought me in, you know, right off the bat and he said, let me tell you something Thompson.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000 You never been in a real army unit.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000 You won't last a month.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000 You'll be relieved if you're a command within a month.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000 You're a snake eater.
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000 You don't know how we do things.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000 And you're not going to survive here. And I'm sorry that I'm not going to be here to see it.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000 But, you know, I'm leaving Korea in about a week or so.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000 But my replacement will see you.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000 And I thought, yeah, that's a motivational way to greet the new guy coming in.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000 So anyway, a company called Bunky Bravo.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000 It became my company.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000 And within a few days, we painted the wall of the building, you know, black and gold.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000 It became Bravo Rangers.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000 And we had a game there. There's a call combat football.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000 You had 40 people on the field from each team with two balls in play at the time.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000 And you had to have 40 people per side.
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Yeah.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000 And you had 10 substitutes that you could use.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000 So before I took over, I went down and I got a new first sergeant.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000 He and I came in at the same time.
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 So let's go down and watch him play this combat football game.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000 See what's going on. So we go down.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000 Bravo company couldn't get enough people on the field to play the game.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000 They had to force it the game because nobody would go out there.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000 So you know, if it doesn't people and I'm thinking, why?
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000 Why are they not going out there?
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000 And I told the first sergeant, as a top, when we take over, things are going to change.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000 Yeah.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000 This company is going to see the world differently.
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000 So once we took over, we had a combat football game a couple of days later.
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000 So took the company down to the field.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000 And they're all standing there and I walked out onto the field and I faced them.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000 And I said, okay, I'm number one.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Top where I get first sergeant went right and out.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000 And I said, okay, top, you number two.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000 Where are my loot tenants?
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000 loot tenants get out here.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 Okay. Now we got some more players.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Where do they in see it? Why are there no NCOs out here?
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 All the NCOs get on the field.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000 Okay.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000 Top figure out how many spaces we have left in case some of the troops are going to play.
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000 Boom.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000 There are all I don't know if I'm going to fill one in the play.
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000 I said, man, they have all the officers and NCOs are going to play.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000 Yeah.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 And it's like we were talking about before.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000 I'm not going to put you on a game like that where you could break your leg or something.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000 If I'm afraid to go out there.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000 You know, if that's leadership, you get out there.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000 Follow me.
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000 I'll say, hi, I have to do it.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000 I might not be the best player on the field.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000 But I'm going to give it my best.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000 One division championship twice.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000 I was there.
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000 How did two parts when you took over Bunky Bravo?
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000 I'm a match.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000 He was a pretty slack attitude for them.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000 And sometimes people get the impression, oh, well, when you come in like that, you've got to drop the hammer on everyone.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000 How did you balance, drop in the hammer and everyone creating a distance between you and them?
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.000 And actually, you just described one way that you did it, which is, hey, I'm going to be the first one out here.
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000 I'm going to be going to lead from the front.
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:10.000 Was there any other techniques as a leader that you utilized to turn that, to turn the, the, the folks that forfeited matches to the folks that win the championships two times?
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000 There were several things that happened.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:22.000 As you can imagine, with Bunky Bravo, there was a lot of drugs uses, particularly marijuana.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000 So I was walking through the company area.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:36.000 I was talking about a week before I took over, and I was walking about a barracks, and I was, the window was open, and I was listening.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000 And they were talking about this new guy coming in as company commander.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000 And they were talking about, you know, we have to get rid of him.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000 And they were talking to a Korean guy.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000 And they were talking about what's it going to cost us to have something happen to him.
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000 So I hear that for a little bit, and then all of a sudden I just kicked the door open, and I stepped in.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000 And I said, you know, we haven't met yet.
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000 I'm Captain Thompson, and I'm curious.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000 Do you have enough money to pay this guy to take me out?
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000 Because if he don't, let me loan you some money, so he can try to do that.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000 But you'll notice, you know, drugs are going to be out of here.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000 Everything's going to change around here like that.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000 So you get with the program, you're in good shape. You want to use drugs.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000 You're going to have a real problem.
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000 And I'll fast forward just a little bit, but what I found was, you could catch someone with mirror
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000 Wanted, and then as a company commander, I could find them.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000 I could take their money, I could reduce their rank, but I know that has no meaning to them.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000 So then I thought, what are they value the most?
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000 They're free time.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000 So, you know, the guy gets caught marijuana and he comes in.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000 And he said, how much does it's going to cost me, sir?
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000 I said, I don't want your money.
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000 And I said, I don't want your money.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000 But at 1700, you report here to the first sergeant.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000 I said, look out my window.
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000 You see that big creek right next to the area here.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000 Yes, sir. I said, you see all those rocks on the creek bank on the other side.
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000 As a yes, sir.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000 I said tomorrow they're going to be back on this side.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000 What you can't do that, I said, okay.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000 I can give you extra duty.
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000 And that's what's going to happen every night for a while.
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000 I can give you seven days of extra duty.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000 And you won't be going to the village.
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000 You know, words spread like wildfire.
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000 But he's crazy man.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000 You know, he doesn't want your money.
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000 He's going to keep you here.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000 Look, when rocks back in the hall.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000 So we started to get the drugs out.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000 Things like that.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000 You know, we had the combat football.
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000 I was able to get helicopters.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000 So we could, you know, they got to play with helicopters.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000 They got to learn how to build bridges.
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000 We put on a demonstration for the president when he came over.
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000 There are different things like that.
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000 And then one of the techniques.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000 I know this.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000 Excuse me, this won't show up.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000 But I just want to give you an example of the power of motivation.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000 And I get in trouble here.
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000 Yeah.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000 Company formation.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000 And I said, all right, you guys need to understand.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000 You belong to Bravo Rangers.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000 You're better than anybody else here.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000 You can outperform them.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000 You can out run them.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000 You can out do whatever.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000 This is a special company that you belong to.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000 And arrest them done.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000 So when I finish talking, I want you to report to the Versaegean.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000 And he's going to issue you a Bravo Ranger card.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000 And this card says that you are a member of Bravo Rangers.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000 And you need to understand if anyone in this company, including myself,
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000 catches you down in the village and says, show me your card.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000 And you can't produce it.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000 You're going to buy everybody at that table around of whatever they're drinking.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:20.000 And also understand if you lose this thing, you have to come to me to get a new one.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000 And explain to me how you lost it.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000 I won't say necessarily on the podcast here.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000 What it says on the back of this card, the online.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000 Let you look at the back of it.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 There you got so excited about that.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000 That was the most valuable thing that they owned in the company.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Well, I'll read one part of it.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000 You've never lived until you've almost died.
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000 And until you fight for it, life has a special flavor that only a Ranger will ever know.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000 Bravo Rangers.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000 And then there's some various special activities that the
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000 Brawler Rangers are capable of executing.
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000 And they're not all legal, I'll say.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000 So that's outstanding.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000 And now, but the power hasn't happened to me for some time now.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000 But in the 90s, I mean, there's an increase in the 70s.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000 And the 90s.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000 I'd be walking through the air, but I'm allowed to airport.
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000 And a guy would say, hey, sir, you know, I'm, you know, Sergeant Jones or whatever.
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000 And he'd introduce himself.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000 And the next thing out of his mouth was, you got your car.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000 And he would have his car.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000 I mean, it was amazing.
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000 How many people I would run into over the years.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000 And one of the first things they would say, you got your car.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 I got mine.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000 They were still carrying these cars.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000 I swam these in here.
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000 If I say one case, first thing they're going to do is ask me about it.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000 So that, you know, I'm a big, I don't know what the right word is.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000 But I learned a lot from David Hackworth, from Colonel David Hackworth.
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000 And one of the things that he did was rename the hopeless battalion in Vietnam that he took over into the hardcore.
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000 And like when I took over for tasking at Bravo at Seal Team 3 as the tasking at Commander,
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000 I immediately changed the name to Task Unit Bruser instead.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000 Same exact idea.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000 And I've got a great email recently from a guy that had changed the name of his,
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 he's had a big construction company.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000 And that his team changed the name of his team.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000 And it like changed the attitude and all of a sudden they started completing projects.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000 And just that little element.
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000 And there's an important part to it is you can't just change the name and expect like,
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000 Oh, now everything's different.
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000 That's an element of it.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000 You have to do the other things.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000 You have to say, oh, we're going to work hard.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000 We're going to fight hard.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000 We're going to win this championship.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000 We're going to be the best here.
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000 You can't just change the name and expect that to happen.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000 You're going to have to do work behind it.
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000 You know, pride comes from, pride comes from struggle and an overcoming struggle.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000 That's what pride comes from.
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000 So when people ask me how do you develop pride in a team?
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000 Cool.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000 You want to develop pride in a team?
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000 You make them do hard stuff.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Hard training.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000 Go through.
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000 You know, even with military units that have bad,
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000 that have battle streamers, that's, that's the pride that they've carried for 50 years,
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000 a hundred years since they did whatever, you know, thing in World War One or World War Two or
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000 Career Vietnam, that's something that that unit achieved and that gives them pride.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000 So you can't just change the name and expect, oh, cool.
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000 I change the name.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000 Now I'm good to go.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000 No, you need to change the name and then you need to give them something to be proud of,
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000 which means some kind of struggle to get through some kind of pain to get through that
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000 that not only doesn't give them the sense of achievement, it also brings them together.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.000 Right.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000 Because when you, that shared suffering that you go through, whether it's boot camp or airborne school or
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000 special forces selection or a hard training mission, all those things what they do is
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000 bring it together and the ultimate form of that is, is combat, you know, which is why you can,
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000 you can go through a, be a member of a guy that was in Saga and you reach out to tilt.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000 You guys never met before and all of a sudden, hey, yep.
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000 Well, we'll meet up at some point and you can move forward. You guys have that camaraderie because of what that unit
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000 achieved and the struggles that you went through.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000 So the other question I want to ask is, when it relates to going,
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000 how do you keep that in check, at least, well, from your perspective for you,
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000 because now all of a sudden, you got guys that are walking around with a chess boat out,
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000 and you start get professional jealousy from the other company commanders and they're going to try and make you look bad
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000 and they're talking behind you. How, how did you contend with that kind of thing and keeping your guys
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000 from becoming arrogant, which is a possibility?
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000 It's a real issue of big issue. And it also happens internally.
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:05.000 So we're out on a range practicing and we're out there for a week.
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000 And all of a sudden, the first sergeant says, sir, you need to come with me.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000 We got a little issue going on out here. And there was a little bank that had a road on it.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000 And there was a little road, you know, 30, 40 feet below.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000 Third batoon, what's coming down the road?
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000 First batoon was going the other way. Third batoon made some little comment the first batoon.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000 And a hell of a rock came down. You know, it's, and you know, we had to go break up a rock fight
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000 because they were so pumped and young. You're not better enough. You can't call us now.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 Oh, gee. You know, all right, guys. These are young people.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000 These are young people. The enemies outside the wire.
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000 And yeah, you can be fired up. But you know, and other company commanders,
00:37:52.000 --> 00:38:00.000 even another batagon commanders were upset because the general, I mean,
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:08.000 I'd been there maybe a week. And all of a sudden, I mean, in command.
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000 And all of a sudden, the siren goes off.
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000 And the siren is deployed to your battle positions.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000 And you don't know if it's real or not, it's just deploy.
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000 So I run back down there. My head quarters and the first sergeants there and say,
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000 okay, what's up? And he said, no, you got it in deploy to the battle positions.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000 I think you need to go to the battalion commander's office and find out which battle plan
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000 we're implementing. Don't worry about the company.
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000 I know we have to be out the front and get in two hours.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000 We'll be there. You go find out where we're going and what we're going to have to do.
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000 I'll make sure we get everybody here. And we load up everything and take it with us.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000 So I go get it and I come back and we're in the head of the whole battalion.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000 So we're going to lead the old brigade out of camp,
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000 over to the battle position this.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000 And just as we start to move, a Jeep runs over my radio operator's foot,
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000 breaks his foot. So I go throw him in the, in the ambulance.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000 But we go and we get, you know, lead a night, we get up on a mountain in the area that we're supposed to defend.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000 And we have to dig in, dig fighting positions and everything.
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000 There's just getting daylight. I got everybody dug in and they were putting in the firing,
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000 the stakes, aiming stakes and all that.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000 And I hear this, what, what, what, and a helicopter pop up.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:50.000 So set stand on a ridge. This guy gets out and all I can see are those stars on his.
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000 And he comes over and you know, I'm sleuding and he says,
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000 you know, Captain Thompson, I, I want to see your fighting positions.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000 So he walks around the ridge and we talk about him and he's asking me,
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000 quite, why did you put this one here? Why is it already like this?
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000 I asked the, this is all the others in the fighting position. Some questions here and there.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000 And you know, I take it about 30 minutes and he comes back. He gets in his helicopter and he leaves.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000 And I said, wow, I wasn't expecting the division commander to show up all of a sudden.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000 It wasn't 20 minutes. Well, well, well, well, well, well, he's the helicopter back up there again.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:35.000 He gets off his balls of three-store steps out with him.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000 And he comes to me and says, I want you to take us around. I want you to show him your battle position.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:48.000 So they get in the helicopter and I was here. I mean, he's ramping and raven to the whole division about how great,
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:55.000 you know, the Bravo Company looks and all the stuff and the pattern of a battalion commander going back and throwing my name out.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000 And then he starts showing up at least once a week at my muscle.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000 The division commander walks in the middle, company mouse all the breakfast on a regular basis.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:13.000 And you know, and he talks and we talk about the things I've got the company to do and what I need them to do.
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000 And you start to share that as, you know, you get to come to the company again.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000 Why do you think division commander comes down here?
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000 Does he go to other people's mouse or something now? He's coming in a Bravo Company.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000 Look around you. What do you guys do?
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000 I mean, you're ferocious at combat football. combat football is his thing. He invented it.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000 And you guys are animals out there and he loves it.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000 And we won, you know, best tactical pretend and a contest it was had.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000 I call private Johns out and I said, look, Johns won third place in the division,
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000 a division, a Christmas card drawing contest. Third place guys out of 10,000 people in the division.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000 You got third place. I mean, it doesn't matter what we do. You guys are winners.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000 We can do it. We just keep this up.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000 And you know, so there's just constantly having things to do.
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000 And like I said, we won the football championship twice.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000 We won the Tycon, Tycon Do Championship.
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000 You know, I was a player coach on our team.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000 And we won the championship in the division.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000 And just all kinds of things.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Because they were so pumped up and they do whatever you'd pour them at.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000 And they, it was like they couldn't lose.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000 Next up, you know, you had to put up with the people who were jealous.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000 Because he was down there with us all the time.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000 And you know, they sent us to, they sent us to be the immediate reaction force for the nuclear sites.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000 You had to rotate people through there.
00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000 So you're on a 30 minute notice to deploy to where whatever nuclear site might be under attack.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000 So I walked in and we were looking around and I'm looking at the battle plans.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 And I'm saying, you know, this is pretty cool.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000 I mean, maybe they'll activate us and we have to go do something.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:21.000 And I said, you know, I would feel better if I could see the live ammunition that we have for the mission.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000 Well, if you can't see it, it's, you know, it's got, it's in, they're in foot lockers.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000 The magazines are locked up. They have steel bands around them.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000 You can't really see it.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000 I say, get a pair of bulk colors.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000 You can't see it. Open those boxes up.
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000 Nobody had opened one of those boxes in 10 years.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 The magazines were rusty.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000 The ammunition wouldn't feed out of it.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:55.000 Created a major stair when I reported that we needed new ammunition because it wasn't functional.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000 A few days later, I said, you know, we got a battle plan here that says we're supposed to fly into this LZ up here and support around this nuclear site.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000 I said, get a helicopter.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Get some choppers.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000 So let's load up the first pretend.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000 I want to make that insertion.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000 You couldn't land.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000 The trees had grown up since that plan was written.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000 There was no wells either.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000 You know, so I reported that.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000 And the tanker commanders that Thompson back off.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000 We'll have to highlight the fine anything.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000 Just back up.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000 You got me in so much trouble.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000 I said, it's not trouble.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000 I mean, what if we had to do something?
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000 Yeah.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000 So, you know, let's, let's a lot of stuff.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000 Well, all those are also readers of lessons.
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:44.000 And then after that, you go back to brag and emergency deployment readiness exercise evaluation for special forces and Rangers.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000 So you're like an innovator.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000 At this point.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000 Yeah.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000 So all the special forces and Rangers came under the 18th Airborne Corps.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000 The division commander from Correa is now the 18th Airborne Corps Commander.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000 So did he call you out by name and bring you back there?
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 Yeah.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000 So he, he had me brought there to do special projects and things.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000 So, and one of them was, you got to be on this scene.
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000 I want somebody that knows about special ops that can deploy.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:27.000 You know, so I would show up at a range of Italian headquarters at two o'clock in the morning and the CQ of paper classified document that says,
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000 we'll's up in two hours.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000 And, you know, it's going to get out of the way because that place was going to come alive.
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000 And then I would go with them.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000 I would, you know, be one of the evaluators.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000 If they put in a halo team, I would jump with a halo team and evaluate them.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000 We'd take them on classified missions sometimes.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000 There's a lot of things that, you know, we would do with them.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000 I just ate up because, you know, it was all special ops stuff.
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000 So I got to do that. That was a lot of fun.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000 And, you know, the sniper team came under us.
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000 It's sniper all, it's sniper training.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000 It's full break. That was under us.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000 So I could go out and play with the sniper.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000 And, you know, shoot and improve my skills.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 And so what are you at this point at this point at a U.M. major?
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000 Shoot.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000 Are you still a captain?
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000 And then what about the next time that Dick Meadows called you up?
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000 circa 1978?
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000 He actually showed up at my house.
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000 Okay.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 One better.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:45.000 I have several people like that that if they called or they showed up at my house, my wife was not happy.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000 Because she knew they were there for one reason.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000 There was something they wanted me to do that she was not going to want me to do.
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000 So a meta shows up.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000 I didn't know it was coming.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000 You know, pulls up in my driveway.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000 I was outside that's all I'm in.
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000 So we go talk and he said, I need you.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000 We're putting together a special group.
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000 I need you to come in and be part of my cadre to help set this thing up
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:24.000 and also evaluate and train the people and be an operator in this group when we get it set up.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000 And he said, I really can't tell you anymore than that.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000 I was you to guy.
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000 I want.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000 I said, that's it.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000 Me right now.
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000 And he said, yeah.
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000 And I said, my wife is pregnant with a third child.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 You know, I just saw my house here.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000 I just bought a house and the author and the Georgia.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000 I just got accepted into the doctoral program and University of Georgia.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000 And named off a bunch of things like that.
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000 I can't just stop this process right here.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000 And he was not happy.
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000 And you know, his final comment.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Tell me was, you hung up your guns.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000 So I haven't hung up my guns.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000 I just need to delay it for about two years.
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000 Now I can come back and do anything you want.
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000 He said, no, I need you right now.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000 And that was the last time we had a face to face in the car.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000 That was it.
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000 And the group he was setting up.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000 Tell us.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:39.000 Tell us.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000 Yeah.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000 That's crazy.
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000 Now what what had made you want to go to college.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 And what were you going to study?
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:59.000 You asked me early on about going to OCS and only have a year and a half of college.
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:06.000 When I left to the second after division as a captain and came back to the states, I was assured
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Secondary's on promotion.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:15.000 I was going to make major we before any other captains in my year group and stuff.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000 It was a done deal.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Promotion this came out and I was not.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000 Which is not bad because many people, you know, a few people and you get a second there.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000 But I was not.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:36.000 So when I called, middle person and D.C. and said, what happened?
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000 And I said, well, you know, you were not considered.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000 I want to.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000 You said, you know, first thing we did was we went through all the records and divided
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000 into two piles.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000 College degree, not a college degree.
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000 You don't have a college degree.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000 You are not eligible. You weren't even looked at beyond that.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000 So that irritated me.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000 You know, look at my performance.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000 You know, why is that performing me and all those stuff?
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000 So then eventually I talked to him and I said, you wasted all your luck, staying alive,
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000 and combat.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 Yeah, I guess I did.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000 Yeah.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000 Okay, and I'll go to school at night and I'll finish this degree.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:26.000 So I did, and once I finished as a degree, then I got a call from them saying,
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000 how would you like to go get a master's degree?
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:34.000 I said, you wouldn't let me get an undergraduate, but now you want to say me for a master's.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000 I said, okay, I'm interested in that.
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000 My plan was, why don't you want a master's?
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.000 Let me find this school that has an ROTC program that I could get a follow on assignment to you.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000 After I finished the Master's program.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000 So what I do is I enroll in a PhD program, complete the master's along the way.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000 I'll have a two year or more assignment with ROTC.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000 I'll be able to finish out the doctorate.
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000 So next time you want to ask about education, I'll have it.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000 You can call me doctor master.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000 That's right.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000 So here I come. Like I said before, if you're going to do it, you do it.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000 You practice, you do what you have to do.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000 You take the lead.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 And what did you get your doctorate?
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000 Psychology.
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000 So I think we talked before about, I started out in chemistry.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:40.000 And I found myself on the battlefield leading men in combat.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:47.000 And I was kind of looking around and thinking, I need to learn how to motivate people.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000 I need to understand the psychology of motivation, the psychology of people.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000 If I'm going to be a leader, I need to learn about that, not chemistry.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:04.000 So when I went back to school, on a back school with psychology, so I could learn how to do that stuff with them.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000 And then in reality, I think I'm going for a circle.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000 And now I understand, it's the chemicals and things and you brain.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000 Just driving all this other stuff.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000 If you deal with those, it's a lot you can do.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000 But, yeah, I got to do a lot of things.
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000 I helped put together the Air Land Battle 2000.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000 I were going to do war fighting in a 21st century.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000 I got to do all kind of research on sleep, on stress.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000 How are we going to fight?
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:42.000 Because we were predicting in the 80s, we were predicting the next ground war was going to be a hundred hours straight.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000 Before there was any break.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:51.000 So how are you going to keep people awake that long and keep them effective to perform the mission?
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000 How are you going to create high performing leaders, high performing battle staffs, high performing teams?
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000 What does that mean?
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.000 So I got to go all over the place and meet really smart people and learn from them.
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000 And work on projects like that do a research like that.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:20.000 A lot of which was used in some in the Faulklands, because I worked with the British Army staff on the head general at the time.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000 There's that we're not doing that.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000 They're just going to stay awake.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000 I said, they can't stay awake.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000 Not that long.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000 So there's some things you have to do.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000 But you discovered that in the Faulklands.
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000 You have to do something and keep them going.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000 And then the Gulf War, the ground face was a hundred hours.
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000 My brother, you know, butch, helicopter pilot, or Apache pilot, he didn't get either aircraft.
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000 He would come in to refuel.
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.000 They would feed him.
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000 You know, while the aircraft's rearm in refueling and sending him right back out.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000 And you know, using some different things to excuse me, keep him away.
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000 So anyway.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000 So then was the command and general staff college was that your final tour?
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000 No.
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000 That was one where, you know, my luck hit run out.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000 So when I finished, I was going back to a regular unit.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:33.000 And then they realized that I was the only infantry officer in the class that had a PhD.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000 And the general, my there to combat on said, you're not going anywhere.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000 You're staying here to work with me on this airline battle staff.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000 I need somebody that thinks like you do and has the combat experience and everything to work on this with me.
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:53.000 So they kept me there for four years, counting the year I was in school.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000 And then they called me up and said, how would you like to be the professor of military science at the University of Georgia?
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000 So you go back and I said, when you call me, where's this coming from?
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000 And I said, well, actually the university is turning down everybody we send.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Every applicant to be the professor of military science that you're finding a reason not to not accept him.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.000 But they can't do that to you.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 You've had an ROTC assignment there.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000 You've been there because of the department.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000 You got a PhD master's in PhD from there.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:38.000 You know, academically you've got everything that's in, so your name's all all your stuff.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000 And he says, they have to take you.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000 I think I'll try that.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000 They took me and I just finished up there.
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000 I had started high performing systems,
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Connelly on the side is just something to play with.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000 But it started growing so fast.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000 You can't have an engagement with a client.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:07.000 And then the general decides, I need you for a break for a meeting on Monday morning.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000 And you can't do that. I mean, you can't turn the clients down if you want to keep them.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000 So now I'm having a conflict.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000 So I decided, you know, 21 years, that's enough.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:25.000 I'll get out and go do the company because I've said the company to be able to do the kinds of things I like to do.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000 I mean, I don't get the shooting people.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 But they don't get shoot at me either.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000 Which is also nice.
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000 Yeah.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000 But at that time, outdoor training was a big deal.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000 Roads courses is a kind of repaid.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000 Throwing the bribe patch.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000 I mean, I can do that stuff in my sleep.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000 And I enjoy doing it.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000 So we had executive jumping off cliffs and going down rivers and rafts.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000 And all those stuff.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000 That played out, you know, towards the end of the 90s.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000 People started saying, Ben, they're done that.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000 I'm on something different.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000 So, you know, we changed up a little bit.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.000 Yeah.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:13.000 So somewhere along the way, you wrote the book, the stress effect, which I read and definitely has some,
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000 some really good information in it.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000 And I wanted to hit some of the information that you put in there.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000 Just to kind of give people a feel for the book.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000 I'm not going to do as much of a detailed as well.
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.000 As I would do with the document that we read about restaurant,
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000 the restaurant, the last podcast.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000 But, you know, just to give people some feel for what your, what this book contains.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000 So I'm coming down here out of the gate.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000 Researchers, Shelley Kirkpatrick and Edwin Locke State.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000 It is unequivocally clear that leaders are not like other people.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Leaders do not have to be great men or women by being intellectual geniuses or omniscent profits to succeed.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:02.000 But they do need to have the right stuff and this stuff is not equally present in all people.
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000 So, this is interesting because you're saying something that a lot of people don't want to hear,
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:15.000 right, which is, hey, there are certain leadership traits that you may or may not be born with.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000 And that's the reality of the situation.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000 Now, I talk about this a lot too and I actually say the same thing and I have this,
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.000 and I'm just going to say that you're going to get different capabilities that you have as a human being.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.000 And what you can do as a leader is if you have an area of weakness,
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000 if you're smart, you'll bring people onto your leadership team that compliment your areas of weakness.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000 But you can only do that if you have the humility to admit that, hey, I'm not that great at planning or hey,
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000 I'm not that great at paperwork or I'm not that good at talking to the troops.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000 Whatever areas of weakness you have, if you can admit to them and bring people onto your team that can compliment that,
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000 and say, hey, you know, I'm not great talking to the troops dick, you know, can you get out there and deliver the work?
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000 And you go, yeah, I got it.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000 And that's fine as long as I can admit it.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000 But if I wanted to admit it, my ego's in the way, and even though I'm not good at communicating with the troops,
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000 I decided I'm going to want to ask you up there and do it, and I bumble around and leave them walking away,
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000 not feeling confident about it, that's bad.
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:23.000 So this idea right here that we all get, you know, you're going to get some qualities, but you're going to be missing some too.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:30.000 And so that's something we all have to admit.
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000 You go here, you talk about learnability, which includes job knowledge skills and experience.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:43.000 It's critical component of leadership and decision making, selecting a former GE executive just because she was an employee of GE to run a hospital corporation
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000 or a publishing company does not make sense.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:56.000 Just because someone worked from organization without when outstanding reputation doesn't necessarily mean that individual become will become an outstanding leader who makes outstanding decisions,
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000 especially if she does not have the learned ability for that role level and industry.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:08.000 This is not to say that high performing leaders can't successfully switch organizations and assume higher roles.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000 However, it's not a given.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000 Right.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:27.000 Important point there, that I have a company where we place veterans into organizations and a lot of times people think, oh well, the person has veteran experience, so they're going to be a hundred percent good to go.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000 And as much as I would love to say that, you can't say that.
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000 That's why we do a screening process and we actually train them to for that transition.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000 But this is the same thing. People just because people are from an organization like you know GE has that reputation for their leadership,
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:52.000 but that doesn't mean that that person is necessarily a good leader and you have to be careful of that.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:01:01.000 And this section here, I have to say, was I found very interesting.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000 Individual leader complexity find the person who can do the work.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000 And so you can do this topic here.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000 Simply put, leader complexity refers to a leader's ability to handle the requirements of his or her job,
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000 depending on the size and type of an organization.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Leaders job is often enormously complex.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000 Two factors determine ability to work at a particular level of complexity, learned and innate abilities.
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000 So once again, you're talking about innate abilities, meaning that people have limitations.
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000 And you know, my big point to that, or my thoughts around that,
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000 is that people that really have problems or the people that don't realize that they have,
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000 limited that they have limited innate capabilities, which means everyone.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000 We all have things that we're not good at.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000 That people that can't admit that are going to have real problems.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:06.000 Now you get into this, all leaders have limitations to what they can learn and how far up the leadership ladder they can climb.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000 Inmate ability as it pertains to leadership consists of four major factors,
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000 cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, motivation and personality.
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000 And this is the most, this is the section that I really was very interesting,
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000 because I work with a lot of different leaders all the time, because I have a consulting company too,
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000 and we work with leaders all the time.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000 So this topic here of cognitive ability.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000 Cognitive ability is how a leader processes,
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000 organizes, stores and retrieves information,
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000 thus determining how she creates the world she lives in,
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000 makes sense of it, and acts on it.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:52.000 Cognitive ability is a key determinant of a leader's ability to be successful at different organizational role levels.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000 Unlike learned skills, cognitive ability is not trainable.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000 It is a hard-wired ability that unfolds through a natural maturation process across one's lifespan.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000 A leader's cognitive ability determines how she approaches problem solving, decision-making,
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000 and interpersonal interactions.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000 Let's look at the general characteristics of cognitive ability going from high to low.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000 So now you're starting to talk about the actual person that has high cognitive ability.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000 And this is interesting, and we may have to come back to this one, that it's not trainable.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000 That's an interesting statement, because I would think,
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000 and I've seen people get better at, you know,
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000 coming up with simple solutions and dealing with stress.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000 So maybe that doesn't fall into those things.
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000 Don't fall quite in the category of cognitive ability,
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000 but here's what you say about the higher, the higher leaders cognitive ability is.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000 The lower the need for consistency in the information being processed.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000 This is a very important thing, right?
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000 I'm going to read it again.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000 The higher a leader's cognitive ability level is,
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000 the lower the need for consistency in the information being processed.
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000 What that means to me is, and this is very, very prudent on the battlefield,
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000 is like you're not going to get consistent information out there.
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:25.000 And if that bothers you, if you can't wrap your mind around different pieces of information
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000 coming in that are contradictory to one another, you're going to have a problem making your decision.
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000 That's what you're saying right there.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000 Yes.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:44.000 You need to be able to have contradicting thoughts, ideas, concepts, information in your mind,
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000 both of them at the same time, and still function.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.000 And they're opposites of each other, but you can still deal with that.
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000 It's not going to stop you from moving forward.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.000 And you'll find a way to use that information to fit in with what you're trying to do.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:09.000 Yeah, the hopes that I have in going through this with a little bit of detail is that people recognize this.
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000 People recognize what we're saying is, I wrote one of the books I wrote,
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000 I wrote the dichotomy of leadership.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000 And it's about this idea that you as a leader are going to have different forces pulling you in opposite directions.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000 And you need to learn how to balance those different opposing forces.
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000 With just about every trait that we have, that's what you need to be able to do.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:39.000 So I hope when people hear this, that they say to themselves, oh, I get wrapped around the axle if two different pieces of information are opposing each other.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000 This is really important.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:50.000 I hope that even though it's not trainable, I hope that you can actually, when people get recognition of it, they can go, oh, you know what?
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000 I know what's happening right now.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000 I'm hearing two different pieces of information.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:05.000 My tendency is just to want to focus on one or ignore them both, but I don't make a decision where I want to need to do is think about how both these things are actually true or possibly true.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:12.000 Are you going, and this is a great example, consider the question, do cell phones cause brain cancer?
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000 You can find as many studies that say, it does as it does not.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:25.000 At lower cognitive ability levels, most people would find the inconsistency in the research confusing.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000 Their response would be, there must be a right answer.
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:40.000 The low cognitive ability leader may choose to ignore the data altogether or pick the dot data that support her position.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000 So there you go.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000 Classical example, hey, look, there's got to be a right answer. We need to know what the real deal is.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000 When, as you know, you can Google and right now, you can Google anything and you can get supporting data for any hypotheses that you have.
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000 And if you have low cognitive ability, whichever one you think is right, that's where you pull all that data to back yourself up.
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:21.000 It says this, in contrast, the high cognitive ability leader understand that there is no single answer and tends to look at the implications of cell phone use in the organization or how to put in safeguards just in case the phones do cause cancer.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:30.000 She does not let the inconsistency prevent her from making a larger decision in which cell phones play a role.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000 So you can still function as you said.
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000 Almost any topic contains some level of data inconsistency.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:08:02.000 What financial markets are going to do in the future when the construction industry will rebound, which airlines will survive and whether we need more FAA-22 Raptors, which is currently the world's most advanced fighter, the key is that high cognitive ability leaders rise above the level of inconsistency and make decisions.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000 They're not waiting for everything to be perfect.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000 And I would just add to that.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:20.000 There's a level of cognitive ability that you get to where you realize there is no single right answer for anything.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:32.000 Therefore, any answer that you choose, any solution that you choose, will have a downside.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000 At some point in the future, there will be unintended consequences for whatever you choose now.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:46.000 So, in a lot of cases with people who can think forward, they're looking at which unintended consequences am I willing to accept?
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:55.000 You know, at some point, if I have enough time between now and then to begin to put in something that may counter that, I know they're coming.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000 It's going to happen.
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000 But I want to make a decision we're going to move forward.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000 It's worse not to make a decision because that's an unintended consequence too.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.000 There'll be unintended consequences for no action.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:18.000 You go on here, leaders with lower levels of cognitive ability are constrained by the information they receive.
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000 Infirmation must be consistent for them to make sense of it.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:31.000 High cognitive ability leaders by contrast rely on themselves to provide missing information, look for more novel information,
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000 and search across more domains to find information.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000 Which is interesting.
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000 Search across more domains.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:45.000 There's a problem over here that's in a certain arena and a high cognitive figure will look at that arena and go, you know what?
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000 That's reminds me of this other arena.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:55.000 And I can apply this and overlay it to this arena that I'm looking at right now and further my decision making process.
01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:00.000 Add color to it.
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:14.000 The greater they show and this is again the high cognitive ability leaders, they show greater certainty in judging inconsistent information and are more focused on long term strategies than low cognitive ability leaders are.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000 But low cognitive ability leaders are looking at the short term game.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.000 The leader with high cognitive abilities uses multiple dimensions when processing information.
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:40.000 These multi-dimensional, this multi-dimensional approach creates a high probability that the leader will match some facet of herself with a facet of another person during interpersonal interactions.
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000 This leader is more inclined toward a simulation of information about herself than a leader with a lower cognitive ability is.
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.000 Thus, leaders with high cognitive ability show a propensity for receiving feedback.
01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000 They seek out information about themselves or open the feedback and assimilate this information into knowledge about themselves.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000 This goes back to me talking about being a humble person.
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000 If you're a humble person you can take feedback and you can put it into your world.
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:22.000 And the other part that I found interesting about this is that the high probability, the high cognitive leader will match some facet of herself with the facet of other person.
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000 When I'm having an discussion with you and you have a different perspective or you're opposing me.
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000 You're arguing with me instead of me saying, no you're wrong.
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000 I will look at you and say, oh, what's what? Where are they getting that perspective?
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000 Oh, I see where he's getting that perspective from.
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000 That actually makes sense because he's on the front lines and he's doing this.
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000 Oh, okay.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000 So I actually will put some facet.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000 I will match some facet of myself to you so that I understand your perspective better.
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.000 With this expanded knowledge and confidence they can more easily find some aspect of others with which they can connect.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000 And this connection allows them to gain more feedback and knowledge.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000 Again, one of my things that I talk about all the time is just humility and how leaders have to be humble.
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000 And which is actually one of the cool things that you said about barswell and we never talked about it, but you said, you know, he was really tough.
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000 He was super smart and he was humble.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000 If those are those are the qualities you called out.
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.000 Yeah.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000 And that's what this represents to me.
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000 You continue here a liter with high cognitive ability,
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000 perceives herself as being more complex than the average individual.
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:37.000 In a decision making situation, she might delay longer and submit a more complicated decision.
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000 Now, when I originally read that right there, I had a problem with it.
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000 Because because one of the monstrous age-old mantras of leadership, combat leadership for sure is simplicity, right?
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000 You got to keep things simple.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000 So I'm going to come back to that one because my immediate reaction to it was wait a second.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.000 I don't know if I agree with that because we're talking about this person with a high cognitive ability.
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000 That's coming up with a more complicated decision.
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000 But I'll get back to it here.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.000 Her interpersonal reactions tend to result in greater perceived similarities between herself and more senior people.
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000 She may perceive differences between herself and others more accurately than a leader with lower cognitive abilities.
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000 This complex internal structure results in a greater perception of the external environmental structure,
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000 which can manifest in interpersonal conflict.
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000 So again, we have someone that can sense what someone else's perspective is.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000 And this is where I come back to the simple thing.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:50.000 The high cognitive ability leader recognizes when she is communicating with others who are at a lower or higher level cognitive ability.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:57.000 When talking to a lower cognitive ability leader, she recognizes that person's simpler language structure,
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000 linear thought process, and shorter term focus, and will understand that the lower cognitive ability leader might not get what she's saying.
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:17.000 So what that tells me take that one step further, what a really good high cognitive ability leader will do is take the complex answer and simplify it down.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000 So that this lower cognitive ability leader can actually understand it.
01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000 So even though it might be a more complicated decision, the lower cognitive leader below me doesn't need to know that,
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:36.000 they're going to get the simplified version that they can grasp and make sense to them and then move forward.
01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000 Continuing on, when she is talking to someone of equal or higher cognitive ability,
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:46.000 she may find that the conversation moves faster and is more enjoyable and stimulating.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:55.000 Low cognitive ability leaders tend to use fewer dimensions when processing stimuli, resulting in fewer and less complex information domains,
01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:03.000 and a lower probability of matching some facet of themselves with that of another person.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:14.000 And again, see, this is why I think it's important to talk about this because if you can't relate to other people,
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000 if you're having a hard time talking to people up the chain of command, talking to people down the chain of command, talking to your peers,
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000 if you're saying, oh, they don't get it.
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000 They don't understand how can they think that way?
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000 If you're thinking that, if that's going to be your mind, that's a little red flag that you are,
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000 it's a little symbol or a sign of low cognitive ability.
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000 You're the one that's not getting it.
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Yes, so when you get there, instead of continuing to point the finger outward, take a look at yourself,
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000 and recognize the fact that there's you need to try and find some common ground with other people.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:07.000 And the fact that you can't find common ground with other people is a sign that you have low cognitive ability, and that's a problem.
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:15.000 So I'm hoping, again, I know this can't be trained, but I'm hoping that when you become aware of it, you say, oh, that's me.
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000 That's me.
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000 And this is the worst part about this whole section.
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:22.000 The worst part about this whole section is this.
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:29.000 What I'm hoping for is that the people with low cognitive ability will recognize that this is about them, right?
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000 This is about me, okay?
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:38.000 I tend to do this sometimes. I can't connect with other people. I can't see their perspective, you know what?
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000 That's that's me. That's on me.
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:52.000 That's what I'm hoping people say. Unfortunately, people with low cognitive ability have a much lower chance of actually being able to recognize this.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000 So that's the problem. It's a catch-twenty, too.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000 Yeah, it is.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:01.000 Continuing.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000 They tend to contrast themselves with others that are and are less open to feedback.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000 Another great point. If you're not humble and you're not, again, I use the word humble.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000 If you're not open to people telling you, hey, you know what you could do this better?
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000 That is an actual sign of low cognitive ability.
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000 I hate to break the news, too.
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:32.000 The next one, in their interpersonal interactions, they tend to perceive themselves as being more similar to their peers and less similar to their superiors.
01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000 They are predisposed to be more rigid and concrete in their thinking.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000 This is another. This is something that you can recognize in yourself. This is something I can recognize myself.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000 When I'm going, no, we got to do it this way.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:56.000 No, this is the way it's going to be. That's an indication to me that I am tending towards low cognitive ability.
01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:04.000 And what I need to do is open my mind and try some new things, accept some new ideas.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:11.000 Otherwise, I'm putting myself on report for being a low cognitive thinker.
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000 Let me, let me share one thing.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:28.000 If you're a high cognitive ability person, if you become angry, the tendency is for you to start to drop in levels.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:36.000 In terms of your response right now, the interaction right now, the more angry you get, the more you drop really low.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:43.000 And when you hear people to argue, and very often, if they're angry, very often, they both drop way down here.
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000 And that's where the problem is, we got to get you back up.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000 And you hear it all the time in meetings and between people, and just listen to what they're focused on.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000 Listen to the time frame that they're focused on.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.000 Listen to the concreteness of what they're focused on.
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.000 And you can figure out where they are.
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:12.000 Now, how can we elevate? If you and I have in this conversation, and I'm down here, and I'm really, I've dug my heels in.
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000 You're just, you're just wrong, Jaco.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000 It is, you know, it's not really wrong with you.
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.000 If you can't see my point here, if I'm dug in down here, we're not going to be able to resolve this.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000 Yep, I just added a discussion on this with a client.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:33.000 It's like the best thing I can do when you say, I don't like this.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 I don't like your plan, Jaco.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000 The best thing I can do isn't, well, that's because you don't understand it.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000 The best thing you can say, well, hey, can you, can you give me some feedback on what you're doing?
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000 You give me some feedback on what it is you don't like about my plan?
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:54.000 Because now, instead of you digging your heels in and looking how you're going to strike me, you're actually looking to formulate a legitimate answer to a legitimate question.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000 And by the way, when you ask that question, I'm not just asking you this question, so I can trick you.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.000 No, I'm legitimately asking for feedback because maybe you know something that I don't know or maybe you see something that I don't see.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:17.000 So I immediately get us to start moving up that ladder again, instead of down where when you say, I don't like your plan, I say, that's because you've too dumb to understand it.
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000 Right.
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000 Where's that conversation going?
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000 You dropped all the way down.
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000 Yeah.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000 You continue on here.
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:34.000 The accuracy of their predictions, this is again, low cognitive, the accuracy of their predictions about others is directly proportional to the amount of information they have about others.
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:43.000 Their concreteness filters out more aspects of the external environment structure, particularly when they're under stress.
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:54.000 Low cognitive ability leaders tend to have a relatively narrow set of interests and knowledge domains, although they may have an in-depth knowledge in a few areas.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:09.000 But consequently, they look for others who share one or more of their interests, unlike the high cognitive ability leader, they do not have a broad range of areas of expertise they can use to connect with others.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:17.000 The bottom line is that leaders with, and what that tells me is, hey, you know, I need to get outside my zone, right?
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.000 Cool. I like jujitsu and I like war.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000 But if that's the only people I hang around with, I'm not expanding my horizons.
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:38.000 So I need to go and play in a band and draw and write and hang out with people that are doing those other things as well.
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:50.000 The bottom line is that leaders with high cognitive ability are able to possess greater amounts of information and operate more successfully in complex environments with a higher level of inconsistency and ambiguity.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000 Then can leaders with low cognitive ability.
01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.000 As they rise to higher roles, role levels in an organization, the problems they face become more complex and ambiguous.
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:08.000 These leaders with high cognitive ability tend to perform well at upper organizational echelons.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000 So true. I mean, you can think about just a difference in any job, right?
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000 Your frontline troops is concerned with, you know, this part of the manufacturing line.
01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:26.000 It's relatively small. It's not a complex thing. And then the more higher up you get in the organization, the more complex decisions are being made and whatnot.
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:33.000 And the good thing is when we think about cognitive ability is there's a place for everyone.
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000 You have a real need for everyone.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:46.000 Someone has to do that day-to-day hour-to-hour work and be happy with it. Be good. Be happy.
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000 Go home at the end of the day saying, yes, I knocked out out of the part above them.
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.000 You need somebody with a little bit more. That's really good at that level.
01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:09.000 And, you know, so getting the right person into the right role level at the right time, because if we think about cognitive ability for a lot of people is continuing to change.
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000 So there's like a growth curve that you can see. You'll flatten out someplace.
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:23.000 But as long as they're growing, they can take on higher and higher role levels as they cross those different thresholds.
01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000 Eventually they're going to hit a point where, I mean, this is it.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000 They need to be happy here because if you move them up to the next one, they're going to fail.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:39.000 Yeah, and what I've see with people is there's a certain spot where they go, yeah, this is where I'm at.
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.000 And I'm comfortable in this area, not comfortable in a bad way of like on my comfort zone,
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000 but you start to move them outside that cognitive ability level and all of a sudden they're stressed.
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000 Yeah, because they're trying to make decisions on inconsistent information and it's too much.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:01.000 And you know what? That's like you just said, that's actually good because now we know what the limitations are.
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:10.000 And now you can focus on this cognitive ability level where you excel at, because by the way, you get somebody with really good cognitive ability.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000 And you put them in a job that doesn't require as much.
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000 Well, now they're going to be bored and you use a term in this book, which I had never actually heard before.
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:23.000 It's not burnout. It's the opposite burnout. It's called Rust Out.
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000 So that's all good. And like I said, we work with all kinds of organizations.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000 And the other interesting point I got to make is the cognitive ability isn't doesn't measure your intelligence.
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000 It measures a bunch of different things that and just like some people are more articulate and some people are taller and some people are shorter.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000 Like this is one of those things where some components combine together.
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000 And you could have somebody that went to an Ivy League school and I know I got to see this in the Seal teams.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:58.000 People that went to Ivy League schools, they scored super high on whatever IQ test there are.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:07.000 Their cognitive ability is not high because they can't look at complex things. They get wrapped around minutia or whatever the case may be.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:17.000 So this is a really interesting thing. I would like to think and maybe it's just because I'm a positive thinking person.
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:23.000 I would like to think that if a person has humility and they say, you know what?
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:36.000 When I hear that when I hear it being described that having concrete ideas probably means that my cognitive ability is a lower.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.000 Maybe I need to open my mind up a little bit and maybe they can.
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000 I know that I saw leaders and I still see leaders.
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000 I know for a fact I see leaders get better become better leaders and be able to look at complex things and and start to understand that information doesn't need to be perfect.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:03.000 And even if I look at myself when I was when I first got to the Seal teams and I was a new guy, I couldn't look at a complex problem immediately.
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:12.000 Oh, okay, you know what? Oh, that these two pieces of information are kind of different, but I can make a sound decision that will make sense right now and we can make some adaptations later.
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:19.000 Got it. No, I would have been looking for hey, what's this writer is that right. I don't know which one. Okay, I got to move forward with it.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.000 So I think that that idea that you can improve it is a positive thing.
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000 Even though it, I don't know. Does that mean it's trainable?
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:36.000 What happens is I, I'm growing and I cross a threshold and I don't realize it.
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000 I don't realize that I have more ability all of a sudden because it is like a stair step.
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000 It jumps up, it goes along, it jumps up and when it makes that jump, I might not realize it initially.
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:59.000 And so I might need a coach. I might need you to come in and work with me to help me start to use this increased ability that I have.
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000 Because I don't realize how to do it. So, you know, we work with leaders a lot, helping them be able to take advantage of their abilities that they have.
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.000 Because a lot of times they don't know what, they don't know they can handle more ambiguity.
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:25.000 I think further into the future because in their job, they're not allowed to. You're in a role level where they keep pulling you back down to here,
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:35.000 even though you have a lot more ability. So one of the things that we're looking at with people in an organization is are you working at your potential.
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.000 Do you have unused potential that if we could help you to start to use it, you raise the whole bar for the organization.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:52.000 And performance, level for the organization goes up because now you're operating closer to your full potential than you were before.
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.000 We were doing immediate action drills. I was tasked with a commander, double two commander, two two two commanders were Seth and lay,
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:19.000 lay, play for all the books. And may Seth was the other two commander, the Delta Ptun commander, and you know the deal with immediate action drills. There's a standard operating procedure. There's a place where you're going to go on a p-left on a p-right on a center p-le on a flank right on a flank left on there's there's positions for you to go into.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:30.000 And so I was watching him in his p-tun and basically the call would get made whether it was him or whether it was the leading petty officer or whoever someone to make a call.
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:38.000 And I'd watch him and he would stay like in the precise position that the standard operating procedure dictates him to be in.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:49.000 And so which meant that if he ran down the ravine and was facing the six foot wall of a ravine and couldn't see anything he was going to stand there because that's where you're supposed to be.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:01.000 And I say hey man, what can you see right now? You know it's like well nothing. Well why don't you move a little bit? Well because that's not the standard operating procedure. Well guess what? You're the Ptun commander.
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:14.000 You're okay. You can have someone fill in here right and you can go and you can crawl up this little this little part of the ravine and you can actually see maybe an out where you can direct your guys so you can get out of this cone of fire. How does that sound?
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000 So that becoming aware that you're allowed to move that you're allowed to think that you're allowed to take action.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:37.000 And reminds me of what you just said about a leader being able to step up suddenly realizing that like a stair step up as soon as you realize that he's like oh oh I can move around and yes as a leader yes you can.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Talk about emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence focuses on the interpersonal and emotional aspects of innate ability it can be defined as a person's innate ability to perceive and manage his own perceptions in a manner that results in successful interactions with the environment and if others are present to perceive and manage their emotions in a manner that result in successful interpersonal reactions.
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:12.000 Emotional intelligence being able to read people. You talk about the innate ability to do this.
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:21.000 But can you learn it? To some degree. Okay good. I'm glad you said that because I've talked to people and help people.
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:33.000 Like let me give you a big hint on emotional intelligence to anyone that's listening. If you want to get better at it. Here's a good step to take. Be quiet and listen to what people are saying.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:43.000 You know when you actually shut your mouth and listen people will and you truly listen to what they're saying you can hear what their tone sounds like and pay attention to it.
01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:59.000 When you're not listening when you're on transmit instead of receive you're not going to you're not going to perceive as much about their emotional state at that time.
01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:12.000 Which means you're going to react badly to it. So instead of being on transmit mode for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about when you're on a radio as a radio man when you're pressing that push to talk button your transmitting information.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Don't be on transmit be on receive that's my advice that'll improve your emotional intelligence in the next five minutes.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:28.000 Motivation. Motivation is a combination of work aspiration.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:40.000 The role level the role level the leader aspires to reach a motivators what drives the leader to be fully engaged at work. Demotivators what cause the leader to lose interest in work and drive for results.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:48.000 The leaders need to achieve in general motivation is highly associated with job performance and promotability.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000 I think Jordan Peterson calls this conscientiousness like are you going to do your job.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:11.000 The personality. A leader's personality tends to be hardwired so that most of his core preferences for interacting with people gathering information decision making and general orientation to life change little over the course of his life.
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000 You kind of get what you get.
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000 How often do you see people's personalities change?
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:26.000 Not much. We're asked all the time. You got a fix. You got a fix.
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000 And we can work with him. We can smooth with all some of the edges.
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000 But he's still going to be a co-chance when the dust cells.
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000 That's the sad fact that I've been dealing with for quite some time.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:49.000 Here's what I have. Here's what I have seen.
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:55.000 One thing that I have seen people change personality from some kind of event that takes place in their life like usually a traumatic event.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000 Something happens. Bad, good.
01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000 Chants luck and they they end up it's not going to drastically change their personality.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.000 Because over time people will be the gravity of their personality will draw them back to who they are.
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:17.000 But occasionally the times that I've seen personalities change the most is something happens.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000 And that changes their personality.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000 But it's hard.
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000 It's hard to change someone.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.000 That's story about the what is it the frog and the scorpion and the frog says I'll take you over.
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000 The scorpion says can we take me over and he says no if I take you over the river you'll you'll sting me and I'll die.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000 And he says no why would I do that we both die and they go across and of course the scorpion.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000 Stings is why do you do that because on the scorpion what do you think I was going to do so.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000 The fundamental core of leadership is decision making.
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000 Everything a leader does or does not do is the result of decisions.
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:57.000 Every day leaders are called upon to make decisions routine and non routine.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.000 And then you say problem solving is just a series of decisions.
01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000 Good point.
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000 You have these steps.
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000 The seven step problem solving model one identify the problem two gather the information.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000 Three redefine the problem.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000 Four generate alternatives.
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000 Of course is a action.
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000 Five evaluate alternatives.
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.000 Six selected implement the solution seven evaluate the results and then back to one again.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:35.000 So that's what we're doing all the time and you talk about the Udalupe in here which we've talked about bunch on the on this podcast.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:41.000 And then you talk about the other the loop that what is it the Pamma loop what's that loop.
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:47.000 That's where you're perceiving information which is so this one reminded me of the Udalupe right there they're very similar.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:35:01.000 So you perceive information comes in your system you appraise it you know makes sense out of it which is like orient right so it's a very brilliant so those two are pretty close right perceive.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000 And and observe would be the P and the O.
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:11.000 And then you get to A which is what is it in the Pamma what is it's in for a s s.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:17.000 And then you get to the appraise and that's very similar to orient.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:27.000 Okay then what's the M then we we get into to the motivational part and then we get to get into the action.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000 And then we're back into loop again.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:35.000 Yeah and you in the last one is action in the Pamma loop and in and in the Udalupe it's act.
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:47.000 So you go through you know kind of dissecting what these two the differences are the similarities and that's that's definitely an interesting thing because again.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:53.000 See for me I always have this I guess positive outlook on things that.
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000 If you know something.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:01.000 You can at least try and apply it right so people do the Udalupe people do the Pamma loop.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000 But they don't know it and so therefore when they miss it or they do it or they or they get caught in some.
01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:16.000 Meaningless cycle of it if they don't know that that's what they're doing they can't even correct it but if you're aware oh you know what I'm I'm not acting.
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000 That's why I'm sitting here I'm not acting so I need to I need to take action.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:28.000 So I think being aware of things just like being aware of low cognitive ability if you're aware of it even if you're aware of it.
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.000 Hopefully you can make some adjustments in your life to get it moving in the right direction you talk about.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.000 Rational strategies which is.
01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:53.000 Logical sequential analytical conscious well fought out process that takes time and typically involves others so this is hey we're going to come up with a rational decision.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:02.000 For our problem and the other one is intuitive which is intuitive decisions are made quickly automatically emotionally.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000 Mostly unconsciously.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:11.000 And this is the type of decision usually made in routine or emergency situations.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:22.000 So these again these are two if you understand these two things that you can make a rational decision or you can make an intuitive decision and understand what the short falls of each other.
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:35.000 Because you can make two rational of a decision right you can analyze things to death or you can just look at the numbers or and you just make that kind of decision it can be wrong or you can make an intuitive decision which can also be wrong.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000 And it can be right so what are the shortness is that this is again.
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000 Stuff that you cover in depth in this book.
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:55.000 Which is very a very interesting book and I believe will raise people's awareness and make them more capable of making decisions and by the way right now this is page 35 in the book.
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000 The book is actually called the stress effect how why smart leaders make dumb decisions and what to do about it.
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000 So all you've done up into this point is explaining.
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000 What types of leaders there are what types of decisions are being made.
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000 So that way you can then explain what stresses.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.000 And what stress does to your decision making process many of the things of which we've already talked about.
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:27.000 Yeah, stress just just always your decision making process as the stress level goes up.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:36.000 Your cognitive ability goes down your emotional intelligence goes down the quality of your decision making goes down.
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000 So managing stress is really key.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:54.000 If you're in a combat situation you're going to make a lot of intuitive decisions when I get all my feet and I look at I see there are two NVA standing there and they look at me and they turn their weapons.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000 I'm not going to say okay.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000 Let me see here now.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:08.000 What do I think the problem is let me heard those NVA what's going to happen and I don't work through that big problem solving process.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 I see it.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 I see the answer.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000 I pull the trigger.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000 And I've got to do it.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000 I got to do it.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000 I got to do it.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000 That's a good idea.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000 And but when I asked somebody and I do this all the time.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000 Somebody will talk about a decision like that and when I say how did you make that decision?
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000 They immediately launch into that problem solving model.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000 That's it.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000 You did it in the last two seconds.
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.000 You didn't have time to do all of those things.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:44.000 What you're doing is you're using the solution that's setting on the top of what I call a dominant response hierarchy.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000 You have trained and trained and trained to produce a certain response.
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000 When you see them, squeeze the trigger as you're going down.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000 That's setting up there.
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000 And that's what you're going to execute.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:04.000 If you want to execute a different plan, you're going to have to train in something else up there because it's going to come so fast.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:09.000 And that's how you survive in a life and death situation.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000 You've got to make a decision and you've got to do it very quickly.
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000 And if you have time, you've got to weaker so to make a decision.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000 You can bring your team in.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000 You can work through that problem solving model and you know come up with a good decision.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000 If you've got two seconds, you can't do that.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000 You go to the intuitive because it's so much faster.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.000 But it's going to grab whatever is setting at the top.
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000 So you better be training for the right response.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000 And that's where the training comes in over and over and over in that sort ofmatic.
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:47.000 When you, when you watch pro-affleets, they train all the time.
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.000 And they train for particular responses.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000 And that's why they can do it so fast.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000 If you like to play golf and you play golf was someone.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000 If you want to give yourself an advantage.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:05.000 And the guy you're playing with is a really good putter.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.000 So you get on the green.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000 And you say,
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000 Jaka, I've always been impressed with your ability to make those long puts.
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000 I mean, we're friends.
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000 Help me out here.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000 To help me what you think about.
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000 I mean, when you're getting ready to put,
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:30.000 you're talking to me through the steps that you go through to make that put.
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000 He's going to blow it.
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000 Because now he's thinking rather than executing.
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000 You know, pros execute.
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000 It's automatic.
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.000 They don't have to think about it.
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000 You make them think about it to blow it.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:45.000 When singers are singing a national anthem or something.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000 If they make the mistake of thinking about what words come in next in the lyrics,
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000 they're going to blow it.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000 Yeah.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000 You, it's got to be automatic.
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000 I, well, we train a lot of GJitsu.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:05.000 And, you know, I talk about GJitsu with the laws of combat and leadership and life and how it all is intertwined.
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000 And guy said to me,
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000 Hey, what, how does decentralized command fit into GJitsu?
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000 I don't see where the, I see where prioritize next.
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000 He's, I see where simple is.
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000 I see where covering movies.
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000 I see where those are in GJitsu, but where's decentralized command?
01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000 And I said, here's exactly where it is.
01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000 You need to train enough that your body parts know to execute without being told what to do.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.000 So when it comes time to defend your arm, you need to move that arm.
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000 You don't have time to think about it.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000 Just like you don't have time to tell the platoon commander or the squad leader,
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.000 Hey, take and put down cover fire as we move to the flank mode.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:46.000 They've got to have the instinct to make that happen without you needing to tell them.
01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:52.000 So that's where decentralized command comes in to your, to your GJitsu game.
01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:03.000 You talk about this recognition primed decision model or RPD and just hitting a couple things here.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000 Here's what you do assess the situation.
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:10.000 Avaluated course of action, select an option, develop a solution set, generate an evaluate options,
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000 adjust the option, take action.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000 And again, these are very similar ideas,
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000 but there's little nuances that you spell out,
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000 pretty, that you spell out inside the book.
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.000 Here's one, the technique of sufficing allows a solution to be chosen that is not perfect,
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000 but it's sufficient to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem.
01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:39.000 The RPD model chooses the first solution that might work a sufficing approach.
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.000 In most cases, trying to choose a solution using a maximizing,
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000 which is optimal or perfect approach tends to be unrealistic and inefficient,
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000 because the leaders making decisions in an environment where all the information about the problem
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000 and possible solutions are unknown.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000 So this is a great thing that I think I have always used.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000 Sufficing.
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.000 Yeah, that's the solution.
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000 It's going to be good enough.
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000 We need to go with it.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000 You talk about cognitive intelligence.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000 And now this is a little bit different.
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000 cognitive intelligence.
01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:26.000 A very general mental capability that among other things involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems,
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:33.000 think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:39.000 It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill or test-taking smarts.
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:45.000 Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:53.000 And then there's these terms catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.
01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:02.000 So this is a different type of intelligence, which obviously is very important.
01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:07.000 That definition is an excellent starting point for thinking about leadership and decision,
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000 especially the last point about figuring out cognitive intelligence doesn't begin and end with having some smarts.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000 An individual must know what to do with his or her cognitive intelligence.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000 And this is once again, you get these smart young officers that at a certain point in the field teams,
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:33.000 I mean, we're getting these incredibly qualified on paper individuals that were, you know, they should be this
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000 smartest people in the world, but you would see them have probably not all of them, of course,
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000 some of them were great.
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000 Some of the guys went to Harvard, Yale, and everywhere else, and they were fantastic.
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.000 But some of them, there wasn't all like that, wasn't across the board.
01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000 And that's exactly what you're talking about here.
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000 You got to be smart, but you got to know what to do with those smarts.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:46:02.000 To some of the things that the cognitive intelligence, some of the abilities that includes
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:11.000 fluid reasoning, crystallized intelligence, visual processing, auditory processing,
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:17.000 processing speed, short-term memory, long-term retrieval quantitative knowledge,
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000 correct decision speed.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000 Again, these are, as you think about these things.
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000 And if you're a humble person, you'll think to yourself, you know what?
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000 I need to learn the problem.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000 I need to, I don't process things very well. What should I do to counter that?
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000 Maybe I should prepare more.
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000 Maybe I should study more.
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.000 My auditory processing.
01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000 Hey, how well do I actually listen?
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000 What can I do to improve my listening skills?
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000 If you don't admit that you don't listen well, you're not going to get any better at it.
01:46:47.000 --> 01:47:00.000 I'm not going to get any better.
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000 Conventive intelligence moderating factors.
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000 When all things aren't eaten, so here's some things that you talk about when it comes to cognitive intelligence.
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000 The factors that come into play.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000 One of them is environment.
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000 You got a very interesting study.
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:18.000 A group of kids that they gave better opportunities for two, you know, like low income kids.
01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000 They gave really good opportunities to some and didn't give them to the other ones.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000 And actually didn't have that much of an effect which surprised me.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.000 Like there was a little bump in the beginning, but then it just leveled out.
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000 Most most of those studies are short-term studies.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000 So they create those environments.
01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000 A few months later they get test and they say, wow, ten of them.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:50.000 This group really improved, but then they don't come back two years later, three years later.
01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:56.000 When you find those studies, they everybody's back to the same as they get older.
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000 But a time kids are 15.
01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.000 Most of the stuff, this enriched environment, kind of work that you do with them when they're young.
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000 Everybody's back to the same.
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000 They've all matured back to the same place.
01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:15.000 So you can't just look at what happens the first few months.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000 But nobody wants to do that.
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000 They want to play with their study and move on.
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000 Hey, I got great results.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000 They work.
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000 They want to sell you the Einstein music for your kids.
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000 Yeah.
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000 Maybe Einstein.
01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:27.000 Yeah, whatever it's about.
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.000 Maybe Einstein.
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000 Little Einstein.
01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000 Yeah.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:35.000 We talk about age.
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000 Here's some things.
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000 If you want to help preserve cognitive intelligence.
01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.000 Cardiovascular.
01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:44.000 The absence.
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000 Here's some things that that that specific factors that seem to help preserve cognitive intelligence.
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000 It's people age.
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000 The absence of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000 A favorable environment above average education, occupational presuits.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:02.000 It's involving high complexity and low routine above average income and the maintenance of intact families.
01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000 A complex and intellectually stimulating environment.
01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:11.000 A flexible personality style at midlife being married to a spouse with high cognitive intelligence.
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000 Maintenance of high levels of perceptual processing speed.
01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000 Being satisfied with life's accomplishments.
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000 Important.
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000 And some of those things are hard for you to do.
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000 I mean, they happen.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:36.000 The most important thing that you can do to maintain your cognitive ability, your intellectual ability,
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000 is a road we exercise.
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:47.000 Nothing has been proven long term to have a greater impact on your brain's operating, particularly.
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000 Delay in the onset of dementia or Alzheimer's.
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000 Nothing does better than a road we exercise.
01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:02.000 Or you're pumping the blood, you're pumping the food, and you're brain, you're cleaning your brain out.
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.000 A road we exercise is all I'll do it for you.
01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000 Good information.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.000 Talk about memory and then you talk about physical conditioning, which I'm a big supporter of.
01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000 Nutrition.
01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.000 Obviously, if you're not eating clean, sleep, getting good sleep, there's one of my weaknesses.
01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:27.000 I don't sleep very much.
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000 Cognitive intelligence can be a double-edged sword.
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000 A leader with high cognitive intelligence can possess.
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.000 Can process information rapidly, solve complex problems quickly, and make effective decisions.
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:45.000 He might also be perceived by his team as arrogant, condescending, and impatient.
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:55.000 The leader knows he can do the work better and faster than his team members, and may forget sometimes that they don't have his ability.
01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000 This is one of those where I'm worried about saying that one.
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:07.000 Because what this does is, it makes someone say, well, you know, people think I'm arrogant, because I'm so smart, because I have high cognitive ability.
01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000 That's everyone else's problem.
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:17.000 But as I've said to many smart people over the years, if you're so smart, why are you winning?
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000 Yeah, I mean, we see it all the time.
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:29.000 That double-edged sword, you come across as a jerk, you come across as arrogant, and you're condescending toward people.
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000 It's always taking you so long.
01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000 I mean, this is simple.
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:42.000 Well, for you, it might be, but for the average person, it's not. And when you start putting that kind of feedback out, you're just taking too long.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:45.000 I don't understand what's wrong with you.
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000 You're just killing your motivation and causing them to see you more as a jerk.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000 That's going to hurt your leadership capital.
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000 Talk a little bit about emotion here.
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000 All human decisions have some emotional component.
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:02.000 That's the way the brain is wired as you're about to see.
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:10.000 The more a leader understands the emotional component of decision making, the more effective her decisions can become.
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000 Emotions happen.
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000 Emotions are neural impulses that happen inside the brain and trigger a motivation to reach a goal.
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:25.000 Emotions are goal oriented. Whenever you try it, whenever you experience a motion, there is an end goal that the emotion is trying to move you toward.
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000 Emotions have their beginning in the unconscious.
01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000 And most of them stay there. When an emotion becomes conscious, we have a feeling.
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:44.000 For example, when the emotion of fear becomes conscious, I feel scared. Emotions can be viewed as providing situational reports about what is happening in the body.
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.000 Why am I shaking? I feel scared. Emotions have survival value.
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000 David Caruso and Peter Salave researchers and educators provide the following linkages between emotions.
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000 And survival. Fear from a survival standpoint is let's get out of here.
01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:08.000 Sadness is help me. Discussed is don't eat that.
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:18.000 Anger is about fighting. When you get angry, your anger raises your energy level to overcome an obstacle in your path.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000 So there you go. You've got to recognize what's going on with these emotions.
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000 Emotional intelligence has always been present and identified.
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000 But not valued as intelligence.
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:37.000 1995 Daniel Goldman brought emotional intelligence into the world's consciousness with the publication of his bestselling book emotional intelligence.
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:47.000 Why it can matter more than IQ. His books quickly spawned a perifflation of articles, books, workshops, training materials, assessments, and conferences on emotional intelligence.
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000 A cottage industry spring up almost overnight.
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000 The terminal emotional intelligence is used to describe a non-cognitive type of intelligence.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:05.000 I define it as a person's innate ability to perceive and manage his own emotions in a manner that results in successful interactions with the environment.
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:16.000 And if others are present to also perceive and manage their emotions in a manner that results in successful interpersonal interactions.
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:20.000 Note that this definition does not require interaction with another person.
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:30.000 Emotional intelligence involves managing, controlling the awareness and appraising of emotions and the resulting motivation and action in a manner that produces successful outcomes,
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000 whether in the presence or absence of others.
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:45.000 It's a leader. I need to understand my emotions and how they impact me and what it causes me to do or how I can use it.
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:52.000 I need to understand yours so that I want you to proof a document for me.
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.000 If I make you really happy and then say proof this, you'll miss most of the time post.
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:04.000 If I make you irritated, you'll find them all. You'll rip it apart. If they're something in there, you'll find it.
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:12.000 So understanding the impact that the emotions are having on you and your performance and which way it drives you.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:19.000 That's using emotional intelligence to be successful, to help you be successful.
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:27.000 You know, same on the battlefield. I need to understand the emotions that you're probably going to experience and what are they going to do to you?
01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:37.000 How do you need to adapt them? How do you need to redirect them? Understanding that fear takes away your fine motor skills.
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:45.000 And I need to train you to be of the operate without those fine motor skills to be able to use the gross motor skills and still perform just as well.
01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:49.000 You just have to perform the task a little differently.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000 So, she, without aiming, you learn the quick kill technique.
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000 You talk about high jackers of emotional intelligence.
01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:08.000 When the high jacking occurs, it sets up an opportunity for your evil twin, the skipie to come forward.
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000 Skipie is the bad side of you who says and does things that are uncharacteristic of you.
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.000 It was not Mike Tyson who bit off the piece of it,
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000 Evander Hall of Foods, Ir during a championship, fight in 1997. It was Tyson's evil twin, skipie.
01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000 So then you just go on to describe the fact that you've got to keep your emotions in check.
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:39.000 And something we all need to look at for, especially Mike Tyson.
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:43.000 Stress interferes with the citizen making it.
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000 And again, now, I've already talked about a bunch of stuff.
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.000 Getting into some of the book. More control equals less stress. I really like this part.
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000 Data collected over the years on stress levels within the baboon population.
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000 Reveal that a higher baboon is in the hierarchy, the less stress he experiences.
01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:09.000 These results suggest that the amount of control you have over your situation influences the amount of stress you experience.
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000 Just to give in example.
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000 In the old days, with a sock team you got on a helicopter.
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000 You flew out to do your insertion.
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:25.000 You found out what was going on at the LZ when you got there.
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:33.000 And one day I asked the crew chief, you got an extra headset up here.
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000 Can I wear that headset?
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:41.000 And he said, you're, so when I put the headset on, all of a sudden I'm listening to Cubby.
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:49.000 Talk. I'm listening to our gunships talk. I'm listening about what's going on at LZ or they prepping it or they're seeing anything.
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000 Did they receive an aircraft fire on the way out there?
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000 If the LZ is hot, I know it. I know what side is hot.
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:02.000 And I may have a plan that we're going to exit the aircraft and go east.
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000 I really need to go west.
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:09.000 All of a sudden I've got all this information that I can use to make decisions.
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000 And I could just literally feel most stress level coming down.
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000 Okay. I understand what's going on now.
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000 I don't have to figure it out in two seconds when I get there and I'm being shot at it.
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000 Now I've got a plan.
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.000 So given myself control, I don't know why we didn't do that right from the beginning.
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:32.000 But I know for me once I, once I could get access to that information,
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000 it just made all the difference in the world.
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000 Yeah. There was a study and I'm trying to remember it all.
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:41.000 It was something about like, I think I don't know if these cats are people or what,
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000 but it was like they'd get a shock.
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000 No, this is the rats.
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000 I've talked about this at the master.
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000 Okay. Yeah.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000 Yeah.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000 Yeah.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:47.000 Yeah.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000 Like so they'd shock them with a certain strength, right?
01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000 Of shock?
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.000 No. So this is the deal.
01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.000 There's a cage.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:54.000 Yeah.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000 Two sides to the cage.
01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000 Each of the floors in the cage deliver a shock.
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:09.000 One of them has a stronger shock, but there's a light that comes on before the shock goes off.
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000 And so they're able to like expect it and understand it.
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.000 Yeah.
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000 The other side less of a shock, but it's just completely random.
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000 And there's a pathway to get between the two areas, but you can't like hang out there.
01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000 So the rats basically have to decide which side they want to be on.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000 The stronger shock that they are prepared for or the random shock that's less.
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000 And the rats always pick the side that has the warning.
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000 So they know what's going on.
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000 Yeah.
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000 Yeah.
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.000 Even though it's worse.
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:42.000 Yeah.
01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000 I just talked about this.
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.000 I was talking to some army troops out in Hawaii, as a matter of fact.
01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:54.000 And talking about, you know, you mentioned earlier that the thing that you can take away from troops that they care about,
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:58.000 money, more than money and rank is freedom.
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:06.000 Contrary to that or I guess the other side of that is the best thing you can reward someone with is more freedom in the form of.
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:19.000 And when you can do it at work, you can only give someone so much free time, but you say give them control over the exercise, give them control over the training, give them control over what time they get done, give them control over where they go.
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000 And more control people have the more satisfied they are, the better they're going to perform.
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000 And so that way you can use that, you can take control away from them and that's the worst punishment you can give them.
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000 The best reward you can give somebody is given freedom, give them control over their fate.
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000 I think that's the most powerful driver I think that even drives people generally more than money.
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000 So I talk about that with companies that they, you know, weigh weak, we can't afford to pay anyone.
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:55.000 To say we can't afford to pay our employees more than X or we'll go bankrupt or in the military, I can't go and you know, I can't pay my corporal's more doesn't work that way.
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000 What do you do? How do you reward them? You give them freedom.
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000 You give them control over their destiny. That will drive people.
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:09.000 And it's the best thing you can use.
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:16.000 But that stress element, like it's almost even in GITZY have that if you compete in GITZY, if you don't know like when you're going to go on,
02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:21.000 you know, because it's like, oh, I'm so it's going right now. But then they're not calling your name and you're like, you get all stressed.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:24.000 But then if you know, oh, it's your time then you're like less stress.
02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.000 It's almost like if you're in the dark about something, you're just more stressed.
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000 So the more information you have about it, that's why people in the word, they're like asking all these questions like,
02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:35.000 I wasn't going to go. They just want to know how it's going to go, you know?
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000 So yeah, that makes sense. I feel that.
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000 Check out this dichotomy.
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000 A lot of people think dichotomy in my favorite word, but it is.
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000 Check out this dichotomy as the number of choices increases the autonomy control and liberation.
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000 This variety brings us is powerful and positive.
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:59.000 But if the number of choices keeps growing negative effects start to appear as choices grow further,
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:03.000 the negative escalate until we become overloaded at this point.
02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000 Choice no longer liberates us. It might even be said to tear nice.
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:12.000 So that's why discipline will give you freedom.
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:19.000 And that's why giving someone, you know, if you have too many options, it can turn out to be a bad thing.
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:23.000 There's a definite dichotomy there.
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:26.000 Here's another, again, I'm jumping around a bit.
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000 A key point to remember is that all models, whether mental, physical, mathematical or
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:39.000 mechanical, have blind spots when you choose a model you choose your blind spots.
02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:45.000 That's powerful. So whatever you're thinking, you're not necessarily, you're not going to be 100% right.
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000 There's going to be things that you don't see that you don't understand that you miss.
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000 What's critical is understand the models.
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000 Understand the one that you choose.
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.000 And so what are the blind spots that I've just chosen?
02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.000 Why am I not going to see by using this?
02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.000 And whenever you can, if you can use multiple lenses, and we do that a lot when we're assessing people,
02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:12.000 I don't want just this one, this is an instrument because it's got all kinds of blind spots.
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:17.000 So I pick another one that's going to close some of those blind spots because it covers those.
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:26.000 And, you know, so I get a better picture of what you look like by using multiple lenses to look at you with.
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000 So I don't, I don't have just one. I give you this one task.
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000 I miss all this stuff over here.
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:41.000 And by the way, if you don't have a high cognitive ability, when you see these two reports about someone that might have contrast to information,
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000 you won't be able to, this report doesn't make any sense.
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000 And you'll lean towards the one that makes the most sense to you that feels the vision that you've been looking for.
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000 Here's the thing that I just had to read.
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:58.000 Catastrophic, when catastrophic leadership failures occur.
02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000 It is sudden and causes a catastrophic change in the leaders ability to perform successfully.
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:09.000 The leader will exhibit some or all of a characteristic, characteristic set of behaviors.
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000 And here's those behaviors.
02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:14.000 And this is to me, these are like red flags.
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000 These are things that if you're paying attention right now, and you're listening, you want to improve your leadership capabilities.
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000 Pay attention to these things.
02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:30.000 And when you notice yourself doing them, check yourself, detach, take a step back, and correct your trajectory.
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000 Because your trajectory is not good.
02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:35.000 Number one, not listening.
02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000 That's number one, not listening.
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:46.000 Over analyzing failure to make decisions, low quality decisions, emotional decisions, flip flops, short-term decisions and focus.
02:04:46.000 --> 02:05:06.000 Reactive decisions, defensiveness, rationalizing, self-satisfying, hedonism, denial, in-attentional blindness, fear-based decisions, anger-facilitated decisions, automatic decision-making and mental paralysis.
02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:13.000 So there's a list of things that you can identify about yourself when there's a stressful situation going on,
02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:19.000 and you start making a rational decision, or you start making an emotional decision, or you're not listening to anybody else anymore.
02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:27.000 Time to take a step back, detach, and get yourself, get your mind right, because it's not right to make decisions at that point.
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000 These are similar.
02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000 List of behaviors that will get you thinking about how you behave in stressful situations.
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000 Aggression.
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000 Laws of humor, taking offense isn't not a great one.
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:51.000 We take offense, right, and that's a sign that says, oh, you're stressed out, and you're not about to make a good decision.
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.000 In my opinion, when you're taking offense, that's rooted to something that we call ego.
02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.000 It's going to be something that's brushing up against your ego.
02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:04.000 Here's another one, wanting to be right.
02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000 Oh, that's also ego.
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:10.000 Wanting the last word, that's also ego.
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000 Flooding with information to prove a point.
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000 That's ego.
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000 Holding a grudge, that's ego.
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000 I know that.
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000 That's ego.
02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000 jealousy, that's ego.
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.000 Playing poor me, sarcasm, blaming, being too nice.
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000 That's an interesting one.
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000 Being too nice, you're just going to, okay, yeah, I'll do it.
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000 Oh, you just broke.
02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000 So there's a dichotomy, right?
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000 One of them is one of us, we're getting aggressive.
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000 The other one is I'm just cowering down.
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000 There's a little dichotomy there.
02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.000 If you're doing well, you'll be balanced.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000 Here's echo's favorite.
02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000 It's my, it's my personality.
02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000 It's just the way I am.
02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:58.000 Don't lecture me.
02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000 These are all just classic, just classic things that you do that should be signs that you're
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000 you're not doing well.
02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.000 Chronic stress is a constant drain on the leaders overall capacity.
02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.000 Accidentally leaving the car light on begins to drain the car battery.
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000 Here you do a great job of, you know, talking about the comfort zone.
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000 And we don't want to be in the comfort zone all the time.
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.000 We want to be pushing out of it a little bit that that forces us to to step up our game.
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000 But if we spend too much time up there out of the comfort zone,
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.000 we'll get burnout because we're having to be undergoing all the stress all the time.
02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000 The other one I already talked about is rust out.
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000 And that's when you're, you're just, you're doing something that's too easy.
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000 It's not challenging. You're, you're so deep in your comfort zone.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:48.000 It's so easy for you that you don't care about anymore.
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000 The further the leader moves into the burnout zone, the faster you will burn out.
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:58.000 His performance job satisfaction interpersonal relationship, motivation and health will begin to deteriorate.
02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000 Dropping below the comfort zone takes the leader to into the rust out zone.
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000 There are the leader will experience boredom, loss of motivation and lowered sense of purpose.
02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000 So those important things to look for with your troops.
02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000 You see someone that's bored, not motivated.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:15.000 Cool. Put him in a leadership position. Let him step up.
02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.000 Stress is not just a nuisance designed to frustrate humans and shorten their lives.
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000 And this is again, I'm jumping through this book.
02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.000 Quite the opposite. The purpose of stress is to help people increase their odds of survival
02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:35.000 by providing quicker response time, more alertness and ability to focus more narrowly on the environment.
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000 The trick is to keep stress as an ally, not an enemy.
02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:45.000 So stress is not bad. It's not necessarily a battle time.
02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.000 It will make you better with, with some, as long as you get breaks from it.
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:56.000 Yeah. And you can adapt to stress.
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:05.000 So it's like, you know, if you, if you live waste and you're going to do curls, you know, you get so echo approves of this.
02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:12.000 Yeah. So you can, you can get so you're using 35 pounds and you're doing 10 reps.
02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:19.000 And if you just keep doing 10 reps or 35 pounds every day, you don't get better.
02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.000 What you have to do is stress yourself.
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000 So you have to increase the weight.
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000 You can increase the reps.
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000 Adapt to it. Then you increase again.
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.000 And what, what your body's doing is adapt into that stress.
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:43.000 A little at a time. So you keep it within a range that it can adapt to.
02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:46.000 And you'll keep getting stronger and stronger.
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000 Same with running. You don't go out and run 26 miles the first day.
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000 You can kind of build up to it. And you're, you're stressing the body.
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000 As you run longer distances or if you run hills or, you're running sprints.
02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:03.000 You do a series of things that stretch you to help you get so you can go farther.
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:08.000 And you can go faster. And eventually you can do the 26 miles.
02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:14.000 But if you just run three miles every day, if the same pace, you've got to max out right there.
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000 And the 26 is just eat your lunch when you try.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:29.000 You know, this is, this is, when I was talking about me being, you know, having a positive attitude earlier, being an optimist.
02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:32.000 And I was thinking about this quote because I knew I was going to get to it.
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.000 When Collins asked Stockdale, this is Admiral Stockdale who's a POW.
02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000 When Collins asked Stockdale, which POWs didn't make it out, stockdale responded, that's easy.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000 The optimists, the optimists were the prisoners who believed that believed and would say that
02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000 the North Vietnamese were going to release the POWs by Christmas.
02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000 When it didn't happen by Christmas, they would say it happened by Easter.
02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.000 Then Thanksgiving, eventually the optimists would die of a broken heart.
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:06.000 The solution according to Stockdale is that you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end.
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:17.000 Which you can never afford to lose with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they may be.
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000 That's important right there.
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000 Yeah.
02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:32.000 We say in the 1980s, I worked at the Center for Army Leadership at 411 North Kansas, a subject matter expert on leadership and stress on the battlefield.
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:40.000 Research indicated that people high in psychological hardiness differed from people with low psychological hardness in four primary ways.
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.000 A stronger commitment to self and attitude of vigorousness toward the environment.
02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000 A sense of meaningfulness and an internal sense of control.
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000 Continue research narrow these differences to three factors, commitment.
02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.000 The ability to feel deeply involved in life's activities.
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:13.000 Control the belief that you can control or influence stressful events in your life and challenge the anticipation of change as an exciting challenge for further development.
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000 Yeah. Those are key.
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000 That challenge thing.
02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000 Instead of looking at everything like, oh no, this is happening to me.
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000 And instead saying, oh, this is an opportunity for us.
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000 I had some client ask me the other day, well, what would you do?
02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:37.000 If your team got assigned the hardest job and how you can break the news to them?
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:44.000 You know what I said, oh, we got assigned the hardest job. I'm going to walk in there and be like, hey guys, guess what?
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000 This company knows that there's only one team that can get this done.
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000 And they're saying it's going to take three months to get it done and guess what?
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000 We're going to get it done in two months.
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000 And it's going to take everything we've got, but we are going to crush this thing.
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:06.000 And we're going to show not only where the only team that can do this, where the only team that can do absolutely anything.
02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:10.000 And everyone's like, oh, yeah, because that's the attitude you got to have.
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000 This isn't a challenge that we're going to shy away from.
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:18.000 This is an opportunity for us to get after it.
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.000 Most people who study resilience agree on a core set of common factors.
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:32.000 Flexibility, adaptability, meaning value, determination, strength, and recovery.
02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000 So talking about resilience. Those are some things to think about.
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000 That flexibility one isn't one that you might think of.
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.000 It's a little counterintuitive to think, well, I'm resilient.
02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000 So I just keep going the same direction.
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000 It's like, no, I actually am flexible and I'm going to adapt.
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000 Got to adapt.
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.000 As opposed to burning yourself out, beating your head against the wall.
02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.000 You talk about this.
02:13:54.000 --> 02:14:00.000 This acronym you use here, stress resilient emotional intelligence.
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:04.000 The ability to resist the negative influence of stress on the emotional aspects of decision-making,
02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:08.000 by flexing and adapting to sudden change.
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000 As the stress level goes up, particularly toward the extreme level,
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000 people lose their access to emotional intelligence.
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:23.000 Oh, if you can't take a step back, take a breath,
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:26.000 and get control your emotions you're going to have problems.
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000 There's no doubt about that.
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000 You have to learn how to breathe.
02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000 Breathing is a big deal.
02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000 Tactical breathing, or you inhale for four seconds, you pause,
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000 and you exhale for seconds.
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000 Very quickly, that will help calm you down.
02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.000 Sledge your heart, right back down.
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:49.000 We used it with sniper training.
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000 When you're reaching out those distances like they do today,
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000 with a 50 caliber, you can retout and touch somebody two miles away.
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:03.000 But the pressure of the pulse and your finger is enough to change
02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:06.000 that your directory to cause you to miss it.
02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000 So it's low in your heart rate down.
02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000 Causing it, be a little weaker, being very controlled,
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000 and squeezing it off.
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000 And you know, the Canadian guy that I don't remember whose name right now,
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:23.000 I think he has the record of a kill, like two point two miles.
02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000 That's a crazy shot right there.
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.000 That's a long way.
02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.000 But why used to do that?
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000 Yeah, I always talk about the fact that it was always our goal
02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000 to never sound excited on the radio.
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000 And in order to do that, you're going to have to control your breath
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000 when you get control your breath, and you control your voice
02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000 that just calmed you down instead of a...
02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000 I really need help over here.
02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000 Just hey, we need two more guys down this hallway, please.
02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000 That's a great to stay calm.
02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:00.000 You get in here to the seven best practices to prevent stress.
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000 And it said, a leader can get caught in ever accelerating
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000 downward spiral, and it starts with rising levels of stress.
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.000 At first, the leader might think, I can power through this on tough.
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000 That's how I got to where I am.
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000 But as his stress levels begin to rise, he finds it more and more
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000 difficult to maintain the lifestyle that helps keep the stress manageable.
02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000 The diet quickly turns unhealthy.
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000 There's no time or energy for exercise.
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000 No time for sleep or rest.
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000 No time for family or friends.
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000 His attitude turns negative and learning holds.
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:38.000 A reinforcing loop emerges that sends the leader into a downward spiral
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000 like an airplane that has lost power in his out of the pilots control
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000 with little hope of recovery unless the leader can break the cycle
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000 and begin to climb again.
02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:50.000 And this is your... something that you call arsenal,
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.000 and other acronym, the seven best practices, awareness,
02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:03.000 rest, support, exercise, nutrition, attitude, and learning.
02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:11.000 And you go through each one of these and talk about how some steps
02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000 to take for awareness, dedicate time,
02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000 to stepping outside yourself, observing your actions.
02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:22.000 And you go through the rest, you give great little sections of what to do to
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000 rest, force yourself to take breaks, include personal time each day.
02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000 You go through support.
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000 What does support mean?
02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000 Support is psychological, emotional, and physical people that help you
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000 in those categories.
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000 So significant other family, friends, colleagues, coaches, mentors,
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000 etc.
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:44.000 And what can you do?
02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000 Identify these people. And you get, again, you do that for each one of these for exercise.
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000 You talk about what, you know, how you start an exercise program.
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000 And I think you use a couple.
02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:02.000 You give one thing is, 60 days, go 60 days, do not miss an exercise session during the first 60 days,
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000 not even one.
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.000 While some say new habits are created in 21 days,
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000 I find that for most people 60 days tends to firmly transform any new behavior and do a habit.
02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:18.000 So, and you obviously are a little bit of an exercise for that, because you still run an
02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000 Iron Man?
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000 Yes.
02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000 How'd you get into that?
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000 Well, you know, it's always been physical.
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:37.000 And about 10 years or so ago, I had my other son and law go do a triathlon.
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000 And he got with Eric and I, and we got to do this.
02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:43.000 This is a lot of fun.
02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000 So, how old do you right now?
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000 72.
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:49.000 So, at 62, you decided it was a good time to start triathlon.
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000 Got it, okay?
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000 Well, then, you know, got into that.
02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000 And then, you know, triathlons are okay, but either, you know, Iron Man,
02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.000 the distances are considerably, you know, fathers, so I got into that.
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000 And, you know, it was pretty cool.
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.000 I mean, it's a tough day.
02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:17.000 Yeah, and especially at 62, there's one last time you did one.
02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.000 A year ago?
02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000 Less than a year.
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000 I mean, this year.
02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000 Okay.
02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000 One this year.
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000 You know, may I start back again?
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:29.000 Are you like ranked in the world?
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000 I wasn't till, I think, last year.
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.000 You have to do a certain number of year.
02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:40.000 And then, then you can total up points and they rank you.
02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.000 So, you know, I think my last ranking was
02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:50.000 fifth in the US, 15th in the world in my age.
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000 So, you definitely recommend exercise.
02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000 Yeah, apparently.
02:19:54.000 --> 02:20:00.000 I talk about nutrition, you know, eating the right stuff.
02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:04.000 This is all stuff that we know, but we don't want to do.
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000 You talk about attitude, engage in activities that build yourself confidence
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000 and self-esteem.
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.000 You get to smile, see the glass is being half full.
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000 Talk directly to the person you are unhappy with, not to your coworkers about that person.
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.000 Become a team player, ask fellow team members what you can do to help them.
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000 That's a good attitude to just men.
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000 And the last one you've got is lifelong learning.
02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000 And again, I'm a reason for these things right now.
02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:36.000 And that's why people need to buy the books so that they can get the men use themselves and read through.
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000 Life long learning.
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000 This is just such an important thing.
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000 Set daily monthly quarterly and annually annual learning goals.
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.000 For example, read two books monthly or improve a foreign language skill over the course of year.
02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000 Spend time with others who like to learn.
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000 Spend time with someone you consider intelligent.
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000 Get out of your comfort zone.
02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000 Learn something you've always wanted to learn.
02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:04.000 Learn to learn the key putting off exercise all parts of your brain by choosing a variety of learning goals.
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:12.000 So those are that's your that's your arsenal approach to controlling stress awareness,
02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:18.000 rest support exercise nutrition attitude and learning.
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000 Here's the takeaway on arsenal.
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000 These are kniser cool.
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.000 An unaware brain is a surprised brain.
02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000 A tired brain is a grumpy brain and unsupported brain is a sad brain.
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000 An unfit brain is a slow brain.
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000 A hungry brain is a distracted brain.
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000 A negative brain is an angry brain.
02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:44.000 An unused brain is a forgetful brain.
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000 Anything on missing on arsenal.
02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000 Now, let's get I mean we have an actual assessment that you can take online.
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000 It shows you where you are.
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000 I mean we use it quite a bit with our clients.
02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000 Stress is always an issue out there.
02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000 So if we can help them find a way to to bring the stress down.
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:07.000 They'll perform better, particularly as a leader.
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000 I'm going to wrap up with this book here.
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.000 Training leaders is similar to training parachutes.
02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000 You have to train them to jump before pushing them out the door.
02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:21.000 And then you say this close and out this book.
02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:29.000 And preparing for the future, we should keep in mind the old native American analogy that describes the past, present, and future as a log burning in a fire.
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:33.000 The part of the log that has burned into ash is yesterday.
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000 The part that is burning is today.
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000 And the part that will burn soon is tomorrow.
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000 We are the fire.
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.000 We can only live today and what we do today.
02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:47.000 Determines whether our fire will still be burning tomorrow.
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:55.000 Well, that wraps up this book.
02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000 And again, I mean I've breezed through this thing.
02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:06.000 There were some points that I definitely wanted to talk about and let people know about the book is called the stress effect by Henry L Thompson.
02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:13.000 And it's available on Amazon.
02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:17.000 What else, you know, we've covered a ton.
02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:22.000 We've merged a bunch of podcasts here.
02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:26.000 What else do we need to know about what you've got going on?
02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:31.000 What about high performance systems, HPS, YS, dot com.
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000 That's your company.
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000 And this is what you do.
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000 Yeah.
02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000 That's what we do.
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:39.000 We work with leaders around the world.
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000 We do a lot of work helping them improve their performance.
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000 We look at their cognitive ability.
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.000 We can measure that.
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000 Then we can work with you to make sure you're getting the most out of it.
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000 We work with manufacturing and building those high performance work teams.
02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000 So, well, I go when you were talking about giving people control.
02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:05.000 If you take a high performance work team and a manufacturing plan and say,
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000 Okay, you guys can start making decisions.
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:17.000 So, you can even decide that echo Charles gets tomorrow off because he's got something he has to do.
02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:22.000 And Eric is going to come in and work his shift so he can go do it.
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000 And you don't have to come to me.
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000 The supervisor to ask permission to do that.
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:29.000 You guys are already authorized to do all kinds of things like that.
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000 If it's going to make the team perform better, you guys do it.
02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000 So, you run yourself.
02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000 You take care of yourself.
02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000 And I'm available.
02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:44.000 If you need to ask me questions or maybe some resources you don't have, then let me know.
02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:47.000 I'll go find your resources for you.
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000 So, we do a lot of work like that.
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000 We do a lot with stress management.
02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:54.000 We do a lot with decision making on distress.
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:59.000 So, nuclear operators that are making decisions about whether or not the plan is going to melt down.
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:05.000 Because sometimes the stress gets really high in the control room when they have an incident.
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000 So, I'm teaching them how to get control of the stress and not lock up.
02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000 Law enforcement.
02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:27.000 For the most part, I mean, the law enforcement has a different approach to dealing with bad guys than the military does.
02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:33.000 I mean, a law enforcement swat team has a different approach when they go into a realm.
02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000 When they kick a door down and go in, it's not like how a special ops team seal team come through that door.
02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000 When you go through, you're going to take out everything in there.
02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.000 When the police want team goes through, there's a bad guy in there they want.
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000 And they're not going to take out everybody that's in the room necessarily.
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.000 So, they, it's a very different approach going in, but it's very stressful.
02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000 And there's things that they can do.
02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:02.000 And things they need to understand about what they can do when a stress level goes up.
02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.000 They're going to do to their decisions.
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000 So, we work with them on that.
02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.000 We can train them firefighters, same thing, EMTs.
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000 So, we do a lot of work like that.
02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000 We're also working with vats, vet organizations.
02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000 So, we have this thing going on.
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000 Twenty-two push-ups.
02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000 Because we have 22 vats a day committing suicide.
02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000 So, the 22 push-ups is a awareness thing.
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000 So, we get that all over social media of people doing push-ups.
02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000 You know, you had to something earlier about, you know, echo which also probably got a knockout
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.000 Twenty-two for us.
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.000 The video.
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000 So, we can post it not there tomorrow.
02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.000 So, you know, we had the challenge goings.
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000 And we have a group of people around the country that have some of our coins.
02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:57.000 And if they run into a vet, they think, you know, maybe on the edge.
02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:58.000 And they give him a coin.
02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000 It says, welcome home.
02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000 Thank you for the service all that kind of stuff.
02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000 And they reach out to him.
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:07.000 Sometimes, all you have to do is smile at somebody.
02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:14.000 There's a person out there today that is all a mission in their life before the days are.
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000 And very often, they set up a condition.
02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:22.000 I'm going to ride the bus to this place where I'm going to terminate myself.
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000 If nobody speaks to me, if nobody smiles at me,
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.000 nobody recognizes my presence between now and the time I get to this place,
02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000 I'm going to take my life.
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:38.000 But if I get some kind of interaction from somebody, I want to do it.
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000 And they get on the bus.
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.000 They go, nobody acknowledges them.
02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000 And they commit suicide.
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000 Just reaching out, just talking to someone.
02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000 Sometimes, can turn them around and all of a sudden they don't do it.
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000 You can take them off of that list of 22.
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000 So we do that.
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000 Is there a website to go for that?
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000 Is that like a non-profit or?
02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000 Yeah, there's a mission 22.
02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000 Okay.
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000 Their website.
02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.000 On our website, we put on our stress effect website.
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.000 We put things you can do to recognize that's not just that.
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.000 But firefighters, police, you know,
02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000 some of those other groups that are doing it.
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000 But particularly the vets, particularly,
02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:34.000 it's not just the older vets, but sometimes it's easier to see and them.
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000 But if you watch, you can see people that are not acting quite right.
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000 And they may have on there their hat.
02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:46.000 Now, you can see they've been in Afghanistan, wherever they are.
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000 And you need to talk to them.
02:28:48.000 --> 02:29:01.000 You had one person on one of your podcast very recently who is a suicide survivor.
02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000 The person attempted suicide and somebody, you know,
02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000 just snatched her up and got her out.
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:12.000 And she'd do an all kinds of things that she wouldn't have done.
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000 No doubt about it.
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:17.000 No, so everybody has a purpose.
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000 There's a reason that you survived as long as you have.
02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000 And to go out and terminate yourself.
02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:26.000 I mean, all of a sudden, all those things don't happen.
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.000 I mean, you might be the person that saves a lot of other lives
02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000 if you stick around.
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000 And I don't think we as a nation do very well.
02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000 Taking care of the vets.
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000 Do end the transitions.
02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:45.000 And I know a lot of the vets who do take their own lives
02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000 or, you know, they're not in the VA program.
02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000 They've just trying to do things on their own.
02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000 And, you know, they get night down with a spiral.
02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000 But if we see one, we talk to them.
02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000 And that's amazing.
02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:04.000 Some of the stories I'm getting back from some of the people that's kind of
02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.000 a join me in this program, women who are out walking or running.
02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.000 And they'll see a guy with his veteran hat on or something.
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000 That clues them in.
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000 And they just talked to them.
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.000 And the guys just turn around.
02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000 I mean, all of them don't.
02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:27.000 But, you know, as military people, I think, you know,
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000 we have an obligation.
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000 We have an accountability.
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000 You know, we'll take care of real people.
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.000 So, anyway, we do think a lot of things like that.
02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000 Well, that's, I mean, that's awesome.
02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000 That you already served your country.
02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:47.000 You know, in so many other ways and continue to serve the vets.
02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.000 And I don't know, do you have any other final thoughts?
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.000 I really appreciate the opportunity to come, you know,
02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000 talk about some of the things that went on in song and some of the
02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:02.000 leadership and other topics that we got on today.
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000 I appreciate you giving me that opportunity.
02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000 You guys have been great.
02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000 Great questions.
02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000 I've been a fine day.
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000 I have a question.
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000 What does make either?
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000 You said that a few times.
02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000 Making use of snake eater.
02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000 Special forces.
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.000 It's like a term.
02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:23.000 It's like a term for like a special forces guy.
02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:26.000 They'll say to him, you'll say, like, oh, that guy's a snake eater.
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000 You're kind of saying it in the context like it was bad almost.
02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:33.000 Like, from who was saying it in your stories.
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000 The competition.
02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000 Oh, yes.
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000 I'm a ranger and you're special forces.
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.000 Yeah, yeah.
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000 So I better than you.
02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:42.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000 So when I call you a snake eater, it's bad.
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000 Yeah.
02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000 You know, when I call myself one, it's good.
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:48.000 Yeah, yeah.
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:49.000 Cool.
02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:50.000 Right on.
02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000 Right on.
02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000 Thank you.
02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000 Okay.
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000 Well, you know, thanks to Eric for getting you out here.
02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:03.000 And I'm telling you, yeah, this is just a total honor for me to be able to sit here.
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.000 And hear your stories and pick your brain.
02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:11.000 And so thank you for coming on and sharing everything with us.
02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000 And, you know, more important.
02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:16.000 And I think it's pretty obvious.
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000 Thank you for your service.
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:21.000 And thank you when I hear your stories.
02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:29.000 And I think about the times that you thought you would not come back and you went anyway.
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:36.000 And you did that for me and for my kids and for our country.
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000 And I just wanted to say thank you.
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000 And it's been an honor to talk to you.
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000 And I can't wait to hear feedback from people.
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:48.000 And I'm sure they'll have so many questions that I'll have to drag you out here again at some point.
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:51.000 I appreciate your service and thank you for that.
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:54.000 And all the things that you've done and you're doing for the vats.
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:57.000 I mean, people listen to the use of podcasts.
02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:00.000 Listen to what you guys say and it makes a difference.
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:09.000 And you know, you just don't realize when you help most of the people that you help.
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000 Because you don't know where they were when they listened to your podcast or listen to you talk.
02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000 But you're impacting people all over.
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.000 And you know, I'm glad I could come in and just hang out with you guys.
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:29.000 And watch how you do this because you really make an impact.
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:30.000 Well, appreciate it.
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000 The door is always open to this podcast room.
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:35.000 The microphone will be waiting for you anytime you want to come back.
02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:40.000 And I'm sure that the amount of people will hear what you've had to say.
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:44.000 And see what you've been through and you're going to help infinitely more people.
02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:49.000 And it's so appreciated again, not just for what you've done in the past.
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:50.000 But for what you're still doing now.
02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000 So thank you.
02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000 Thank you.
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000 Thank you, echo.
02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:00.000 So once again, Dick Thompson has left the building.
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:05.000 And once again, I cannot even get my mind around.
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:13.000 What he's done and what he has learned and what he is passing on in these lessons.
02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:21.000 Because really there's no better way to learn and there's no better teacher than
02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:26.000 learning from those who have gone before us.
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:36.000 Who have tested the limits of human capacity for performance and leadership and decision making.
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000 And here we are.
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000 We get to sit here.
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:46.000 We have to actually sit here and absorb the knowledge of these great men.
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:51.000 Who paid dearly for this knowledge.
02:34:51.000 --> 02:35:00.000 And as we know, many of their comrades paid with their very lives.
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000 So let us never forget that.
02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:12.000 That for every lesson there was blood spilled for every story.
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000 There is a man who did not return.
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:21.000 So value.
02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:31.000 These lessons, lessons that we can apply to our lives, to our family, to our businesses, to our communities.
02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:39.000 Everything we do we can apply, what we're learning here, don't squander these lessons.
02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000 We can do the attention to them.
02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.000 Be aware.
02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000 We talk a lot about awareness.
02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:51.000 Be aware of your own shortfalls.
02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000 And then apply these lessons.
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000 That's what you have to actually apply them.
02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000 You can't sit back and listen to them.
02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:03.000 You're going to actually apply them.
02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:06.000 So echo.
02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:09.000 We are all looking to learn.
02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:16.000 We are all looking to somehow make up for our own shortfalls.
02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:19.000 And apply things to our lives.
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000 That will make us better.
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:25.000 Do you know of anything?
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000 Softball coming at you.
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000 Do you know of anything?
02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:32.000 That broadly speaking can make our lives better.
02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:37.000 Probably and narrowly.
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000 That would be.
02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000 Okay.
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:45.000 Now is it possible that you're just a person that's just into it and so you're biased.
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:46.000 Because you like to do it.
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:50.000 Now you think everyone could gain from it and benefit from it, even though that could be wrong.
02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.000 Is that a possibility?
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:52.000 Yes.
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000 That's a possibility.
02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000 Well, actually I was going to say that's actually not possible.
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:56.000 Yeah.
02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:59.000 Well, I'm more saying yes to the bias part of it.
02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:03.000 Okay.
02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000 You are biased.
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000 But even if you're biased, then that doesn't mean it's necessarily wrong.
02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:08.000 I would tell you this.
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:09.000 You're biased.
02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000 You're biased in favor of your jutsu.
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:20.000 And that doesn't affect the outcome of someone starting to jutsu and really gaining a ton from it.
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000 In making their life better.
02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000 Yes.
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000 Across the board.
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.000 It's kind of like, you know how.
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:31.000 Like the sun. If I say, hey, the sun is warm on my face today.
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000 And I really like that.
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000 Okay.
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000 And I'm biased towards the sun.
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:36.000 Okay.
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.000 What if someone doesn't like that?
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:38.000 It's still warm on their face.
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:39.000 Seems like.
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000 Okay.
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000 Let's say not only that they didn't know.
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000 No, no, Brad, that was a perfect analogy.
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:44.000 Yeah.
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000 Actually, that was pretty bad.
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000 But nonetheless, short notice.
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:48.000 That's sort of how it goes.
02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000 Hey, what's actually.
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:51.000 Factually.
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000 Actually, you just do will improve your life.
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000 Yes.
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000 Yeah.
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000 I guess that is possible.
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000 Yes.
02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000 And I don't mean do jutsu wrong.
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000 I mean approach.
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.000 Yeah.
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:02.000 Jutsu wrong.
02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:03.000 So like, okay.
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000 So you mentioned before how.
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.000 How the person, like a person in the beginning.
02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:13.000 You, your confidence go like can go backwards.
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000 One step because you're like, oh, like how many people know this.
02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000 And I didn't even realize it.
02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:19.000 So you're kind of apprehensive.
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000 Just in general.
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.000 That is yes.
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:26.000 If you approach it correctly, in my opinion, because if you approach it wrong,
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000 you're kind of like, oh, I know a choke.
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000 No, I know arm lock.
02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000 Now I'm better than everybody.
02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000 You know, kind of thing.
02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000 That's the reality of Jutsu.
02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000 You won't feel that way because you'll get before you choke.
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:40.000 You learn a choke, but then you get choke and our mocked and
02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000 come here at 15 times in one day.
02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:45.000 So you don't feel more confident out of the date.
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000 I didn't know.
02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000 Yeah.
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000 But then he can't know.
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000 You know what?
02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000 A small part of me did did.
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000 Only if I knew the other.
02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.000 Yes.
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000 It told me was.
02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000 But on top of it, I would know, you know, I know who in my little,
02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:03.000 when you say in my circles, like I knew who didn't train and who did,
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:04.000 just like we all do, you know.
02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:07.000 I mean, strangers, I'd always be like, man, like,
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000 you know what I'm going to watch out.
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000 Yeah, just like, you know how like sometimes you're like,
02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000 you don't know if like I has a weapon or something like that.
02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000 That feeling, it's that feeling, you know,
02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000 but a little bit worse because
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000 if a guy's a web being kind of runaway,
02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000 what a guy's going to, kind of, get your corpse
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000 you want o'er, all the way around and form a command,
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000 like you're sitting here and have to run away.
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:23.000 No, look what?
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000 Well, it's like, there is an exception,
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:25.000 somebody.
02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:28.50 Is that sat in a car store like anything we got
02:39:28.50 --> 02:39:29.50 or just said it.
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:31.000 Yeah.
02:39:29.50 --> 02:39:32.80 It's not like you can't get away with it,
02:39:32.80 --> 02:39:34.000 it gets your lifetimes.
02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:34.50 Right?
02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:37.50 Right?
02:39:37.50 --> 02:39:38.50 And the, I had thisись to pick up.
02:39:38.50 --> 02:39:38.98 He's a bunch of people are put around and they're not
02:39:38.98 --> 02:39:40.000 put in there.
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000 So, Human Power was like a gun.
02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000 Really?
02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000 He's a bunch of people with respect or momentum.
02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000 Have you lived in the rural room?
02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:47.000 Like in the 1400's wife,
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.84 it's as you have to get around the other person's legs.
02:39:49.84 --> 02:39:51.44 Yeah. That's the whole, that's what you got to do.
02:39:51.44 --> 02:39:53.96 You think, oh, how long is that going to take?
02:39:53.96 --> 02:39:56.24 Four seconds, three seconds, maybe even two seconds,
02:39:56.24 --> 02:39:57.40 whatever, I'll get around their legs.
02:39:58.20 --> 02:40:00.72 And then you realize it can take years and years and years
02:40:00.72 --> 02:40:02.84 of trying to get past one person's guard.
02:40:02.84 --> 02:40:04.52 If not never, sometimes.
02:40:04.52 --> 02:40:05.32 Yeah.
02:40:05.32 --> 02:40:06.68 And that's a crazy thing.
02:40:06.68 --> 02:40:07.32 Very crazy.
02:40:07.32 --> 02:40:09.56 It was, I think it was you at the master,
02:40:10.12 --> 02:40:12.08 where I was like, we're talking about that.
02:40:12.08 --> 02:40:13.80 I forget if you were saying it or I was saying it,
02:40:14.80 --> 02:40:15.60 I think you were saying it.
02:40:15.60 --> 02:40:17.60 And I was like, maybe, I don't know,
02:40:17.60 --> 02:40:18.44 nonetheless, I was like,
02:40:18.44 --> 02:40:19.96 because technically getting past someone's guard
02:40:19.96 --> 02:40:21.84 is just getting past your legs, just like what you said.
02:40:21.84 --> 02:40:23.72 And you can use this whole room.
02:40:23.72 --> 02:40:27.28 I don't care if you walk out the door and sneak back in the back door.
02:40:27.28 --> 02:40:28.80 You still can't do it.
02:40:28.80 --> 02:40:30.40 And like you can, like I was,
02:40:30.40 --> 02:40:33.20 and I did a little demonstration where I'd be like,
02:40:33.20 --> 02:40:35.52 okay, this is like, all I got to do is get past your legs.
02:40:35.52 --> 02:40:37.68 Guard, no guard, I just got to get past your legs, right?
02:40:37.68 --> 02:40:40.20 So I backed way up and I started like walking around,
02:40:40.20 --> 02:40:41.40 like you do this like turn.
02:40:41.40 --> 02:40:43.32 And it just, yeah, it's crazy.
02:40:43.32 --> 02:40:47.000 I'll just, how impossible that can kind of seem, you know?
02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.96 But that's the jujitsu, you know?
02:40:48.96 --> 02:40:52.16 And that's one tiny little sliver of an aspect of it.
02:40:52.16 --> 02:40:53.44 It's just passing the guard.
02:40:53.44 --> 02:40:57.16 You know, yes, it goes deep.
02:40:57.16 --> 02:41:00.56 No, nonetheless, but yes, if you approach it correctly,
02:41:01.16 --> 02:41:02.84 I have no doubt in my mind.
02:41:02.84 --> 02:41:06.52 I don't know under any circumstance where it would
02:41:06.52 --> 02:41:10.000 be an improvement in your life, net, net.
02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:11.68 Yeah, cannot think of one.
02:41:11.68 --> 02:41:14.44 So overall we're saying, do jujitsu.
02:41:14.44 --> 02:41:15.28 Yes, sir.
02:41:15.28 --> 02:41:17.76 And once we decide to do jujitsu, which we just decided,
02:41:17.76 --> 02:41:19.28 now we need to get a G.
02:41:19.28 --> 02:41:23.48 Yes, we get an origin G from originmain.com.
02:41:23.48 --> 02:41:25.12 You get a lot of stuff from there, but yes,
02:41:25.12 --> 02:41:27.92 you get your G from there many different options.
02:41:29.12 --> 02:41:30.40 Speaking of G's.
02:41:30.40 --> 02:41:33.72 I've been noticing people getting blue belt,
02:41:34.36 --> 02:41:39.08 winning tournaments, saying, hey, I joined jujitsu
02:41:39.08 --> 02:41:40.36 because of Joko.
02:41:40.36 --> 02:41:41.80 Yeah, because of this.
02:41:41.80 --> 02:41:42.76 Well, yeah.
02:41:42.76 --> 02:41:46.96 So there's a camp this year.
02:41:46.96 --> 02:41:49.60 There was people that were like, I'm a Joko Blue belt.
02:41:49.60 --> 02:41:49.96 Right.
02:41:49.96 --> 02:41:50.96 And I was like, what is that?
02:41:50.96 --> 02:41:52.84 And they say, I started training because the podcast
02:41:52.84 --> 02:41:54.60 and I was like, oh, awesome.
02:41:54.60 --> 02:41:58.44 And I've met, I think, two Joko Purple belts.
02:41:58.44 --> 02:42:02.68 Oh, well, the podcast has only been out for four years.
02:42:02.68 --> 02:42:04.04 Fourish, yeah.
02:42:04.04 --> 02:42:05.60 Yeah, we're coming up on four years.
02:42:05.60 --> 02:42:08.04 So I mean, someone out of the gate was like, OK, I'm getting it.
02:42:08.04 --> 02:42:10.48 Because you got, you know, it takes about four years to get a purple belt.
02:42:10.48 --> 02:42:12.28 If you're like training hard, right?
02:42:12.28 --> 02:42:13.88 This is no slack.
02:42:13.88 --> 02:42:15.84 Someone that just jumps in.
02:42:15.84 --> 02:42:20.36 So I think I've met two like Joko Purple belts.
02:42:21.64 --> 02:42:22.000 So legit.
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.52 But yeah, that's super cool.
02:42:23.52 --> 02:42:24.36 Yeah.
02:42:24.36 --> 02:42:26.56 So so you're not alone.
02:42:26.56 --> 02:42:29.72 Don't feel like you ever feel like I know
02:42:29.72 --> 02:42:31.72 one's really actually doing that.
02:42:31.72 --> 02:42:32.72 So I'm not doing it.
02:42:32.72 --> 02:42:33.56 Yeah.
02:42:33.56 --> 02:42:34.72 People are absolutely doing it.
02:42:34.72 --> 02:42:35.40 Yeah, yes.
02:42:35.40 --> 02:42:36.24 100%.
02:42:36.24 --> 02:42:39.40 My wife just wasn't England.
02:42:39.40 --> 02:42:40.68 She delivered a friend.
02:42:40.68 --> 02:42:45.68 She delivered an origingie to England for her friends,
02:42:49.64 --> 02:42:52.32 husband, Anthony.
02:42:52.32 --> 02:42:55.80 He's, he's, you know, he's like, whatever.
02:42:55.80 --> 02:43:00.12 50, he's like my age 40, 852, something like that.
02:43:00.12 --> 02:43:01.56 Obsessed with the Jiu Jitsu.
02:43:01.56 --> 02:43:03.60 He's been training for six months.
02:43:03.60 --> 02:43:04.96 Jack, a white belt.
02:43:04.96 --> 02:43:06.48 He's like in the game, right?
02:43:06.48 --> 02:43:07.32 Yeah.
02:43:07.32 --> 02:43:08.64 At some point, you commit.
02:43:08.64 --> 02:43:09.96 You say you know what I'm going to do this.
02:43:09.96 --> 02:43:10.80 Yeah.
02:43:10.80 --> 02:43:11.80 Just do it.
02:43:11.80 --> 02:43:12.80 Yeah.
02:43:12.80 --> 02:43:13.80 Just do it.
02:43:13.80 --> 02:43:15.64 This is how you know you and we haven't used the expression.
02:43:15.64 --> 02:43:16.96 You just to bug recently.
02:43:16.96 --> 02:43:21.96 But this is how you kind of know when you're sort of trying to figure out moves
02:43:21.96 --> 02:43:25.48 when you're like, embed or driving or this kind of stuff.
02:43:25.48 --> 02:43:27.44 What is like constantly rolling in your mind?
02:43:27.44 --> 02:43:28.72 It might be this a good feeling.
02:43:28.72 --> 02:43:29.72 Yeah.
02:43:29.72 --> 02:43:31.96 Because it does translate when you go back in, like you work it out.
02:43:31.96 --> 02:43:33.76 It's good, man.
02:43:33.76 --> 02:43:36.88 But yes, people are in the game.
02:43:36.88 --> 02:43:39.56 So yeah, and you're going to train G.
02:43:39.56 --> 02:43:42.28 So get a Jiu Jitsu G from origin main.com.
02:43:42.28 --> 02:43:46.52 Get a rash guard so you can train no G, which is also important.
02:43:46.52 --> 02:43:47.52 Very important.
02:43:47.52 --> 02:43:51.44 As Echo would say, I would just say important.
02:43:51.44 --> 02:43:52.44 But you would say important.
02:43:52.44 --> 02:43:54.000 I don't hear the difference.
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000 Yeah.
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.000 I don't hear anything.
02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:03.68 And then the problem is, the problem is you're going to want to represent.
02:44:03.68 --> 02:44:04.68 Off the mats.
02:44:04.68 --> 02:44:05.68 Off the mats.
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:06.68 Right?
02:44:06.68 --> 02:44:09.68 And we can go into the whole thing about how you can't wear a G to the club.
02:44:09.68 --> 02:44:10.68 Right?
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:11.68 Yes.
02:44:11.68 --> 02:44:13.68 You can't wear a G to the grocery store.
02:44:13.68 --> 02:44:14.68 Jiu Jitsu G.
02:44:14.68 --> 02:44:15.68 Now you can get away with G pants.
02:44:15.68 --> 02:44:16.68 Let's face it.
02:44:16.68 --> 02:44:17.68 Let's face it.
02:44:17.68 --> 02:44:21.68 I think most of us have been into a grocery store in G pants.
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:22.68 I know I have.
02:44:22.68 --> 02:44:23.68 Especially the black ones.
02:44:23.68 --> 02:44:24.68 The orange and black ones.
02:44:24.68 --> 02:44:25.68 They could look kind of dope.
02:44:25.68 --> 02:44:27.68 You could probably go to a club in the origin black.
02:44:27.68 --> 02:44:28.68 You could put it off.
02:44:28.68 --> 02:44:29.68 You could pull it off.
02:44:29.68 --> 02:44:30.68 What kind of level?
02:44:30.68 --> 02:44:31.68 What kind of fashion?
02:44:31.68 --> 02:44:32.68 You know you're a fashion guy.
02:44:32.68 --> 02:44:34.68 Where does that fit into the fashion world?
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:41.68 Like what would you wear with black G pants to a club to a, let's say a bar.
02:44:41.68 --> 02:44:42.68 You're going to a bar.
02:44:42.68 --> 02:44:45.68 You put on the G pants and you just what are you using wearing a t-shirt.
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:46.68 There's an orange and t-shirt.
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:49.68 Well, that's not a death court t-shirt.
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:51.68 Let's clarify.
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:53.68 First off, I'm not a fashion person.
02:44:53.68 --> 02:44:57.68 But if I was, I would say there is no fashionable.
02:44:57.68 --> 02:45:01.68 Unless you're going to extreme new age fashion, which I can think.
02:45:01.68 --> 02:45:03.68 Then yeah, you could wear it.
02:45:03.68 --> 02:45:04.68 You know, it's funny.
02:45:04.68 --> 02:45:08.68 You ever heard of this store called Patagonia.
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:11.68 It made out of a wearer and stuff.
02:45:11.68 --> 02:45:12.68 Oh, yeah.
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:13.68 Outdoor clothing, right?
02:45:13.68 --> 02:45:15.68 Well, Patagonia used to have pants.
02:45:15.68 --> 02:45:16.68 They maybe they still do.
02:45:16.68 --> 02:45:19.68 That were called G pants.
02:45:19.68 --> 02:45:20.68 That's what they were called.
02:45:20.68 --> 02:45:21.68 They probably still have.
02:45:21.68 --> 02:45:26.68 So maybe, you know, they're over there wearing their G pants out.
02:45:26.68 --> 02:45:30.68 Maybe we just get the game and represent even harder.
02:45:30.68 --> 02:45:31.68 But are they called?
02:45:31.68 --> 02:45:32.68 Yes, they're called G pants.
02:45:32.68 --> 02:45:33.68 Or they called G-Pants.
02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:34.68 Or they called G-I-Pants.
02:45:34.68 --> 02:45:36.68 They're called G-Pants.
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:41.68 They're, they're, when you, I remember back in the day I would read the little description.
02:45:41.68 --> 02:45:47.68 And it would say, you know, the G-Pants is based on the loose fitting martial arts.
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:48.68 Oh, yeah.
02:45:48.68 --> 02:45:50.68 Yeah, and I say that in a little description.
02:45:50.68 --> 02:45:51.68 Yeah, that's okay.
02:45:51.68 --> 02:45:52.68 So yeah.
02:45:52.68 --> 02:45:53.68 All right.
02:45:53.68 --> 02:45:54.68 Well, yeah.
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:55.68 I mean, then it's kind of like whatever you day.
02:45:55.68 --> 02:45:57.68 I mean, it wouldn't be a violation overall.
02:45:57.68 --> 02:45:59.68 Especially if there were the black ones.
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:03.68 So if you were the white, maybe the kind of where people will look like if you were.
02:46:03.68 --> 02:46:05.68 Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, you couldn't wear white.
02:46:05.68 --> 02:46:06.68 No.
02:46:06.68 --> 02:46:07.68 He pants out for just no reason.
02:46:07.68 --> 02:46:09.68 But the black, you could kind of be a hard one.
02:46:09.68 --> 02:46:10.68 Pull off, yes, sir.
02:46:10.68 --> 02:46:11.68 Yeah.
02:46:11.68 --> 02:46:12.68 So anyways.
02:46:12.68 --> 02:46:16.68 But if you don't want to wear your G-Pants, and you still want to represent, that's fine.
02:46:16.68 --> 02:46:20.68 You can get a pair of origin jeans, which are also made in America.
02:46:20.68 --> 02:46:24.68 The little brass rivets are made in America.
02:46:24.68 --> 02:46:25.68 The zipper is made in America.
02:46:25.68 --> 02:46:27.68 The thread is made in America.
02:46:27.68 --> 02:46:34.68 And they're sewn by craftsmen, crafts women up in Maine.
02:46:34.68 --> 02:46:37.68 That's what they're made.
02:46:37.68 --> 02:46:38.68 So everything is there.
02:46:38.68 --> 02:46:42.68 There's that there as American as American can be.
02:46:42.68 --> 02:46:44.68 That's what those jeans are.
02:46:44.68 --> 02:46:50.68 When you put them on, you are embracing America through its core.
02:46:50.68 --> 02:46:52.68 And you're rebuilding America.
02:46:52.68 --> 02:46:55.68 Because you got to remember all those, none of those people had jobs.
02:46:55.68 --> 02:47:01.68 None of those people at origin had jobs five years ago, three years ago, two years ago.
02:47:01.68 --> 02:47:04.68 Because all the jobs had been taken overseas.
02:47:04.68 --> 02:47:06.68 We're bringing them back.
02:47:06.68 --> 02:47:15.68 So embrace America and embrace origin jeans.
02:47:15.68 --> 02:47:16.68 Two kinds.
02:47:16.68 --> 02:47:19.68 There's the heavy, there's the factory jeans.
02:47:19.68 --> 02:47:23.68 What we call those are the OG, the original ones.
02:47:23.68 --> 02:47:28.68 And then there's the Delta 68, which are mine.
02:47:28.68 --> 02:47:31.68 And I signature jeans.
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:33.68 But they don't say Jocquawanum.
02:47:33.68 --> 02:47:36.68 Because that's not, no, they say Delta 68,
02:47:36.68 --> 02:47:39.68 named after my four fathers in the SEAL teams in Vietnam.
02:47:39.68 --> 02:47:45.68 That wore jeans into the May Kong Delta to hunt down the enemy.
02:47:45.68 --> 02:47:48.68 And they did it because they were more durable.
02:47:48.68 --> 02:47:49.68 They lasted longer.
02:47:49.68 --> 02:47:50.68 They were quiet.
02:47:50.68 --> 02:47:51.68 So that's what we did.
02:47:51.68 --> 02:47:53.68 We brought them back.
02:47:53.68 --> 02:47:54.68 Delta 68.
02:47:54.68 --> 02:47:55.68 Represent.

02:48:06.68 --> 02:48:11.68 So, you know, 50 years old, your friends, your wife's friends, husband.
02:48:11.68 --> 02:48:12.68 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:48:12.68 --> 02:48:13.68 What was the name again?
02:48:13.68 --> 02:48:14.68 Anthony.
02:48:14.68 --> 02:48:15.68 Anthony.
02:48:15.68 --> 02:48:16.68 50.
02:48:16.68 --> 02:48:17.68 We'll just say 50.
02:48:17.68 --> 02:48:18.68 Around 50.
02:48:18.68 --> 02:48:19.68 So, cause people will ask,
02:48:19.68 --> 02:48:21.68 Like, am I too old to start you?
02:48:21.68 --> 02:48:22.68 No, you're 40.
02:48:22.68 --> 02:48:23.68 You're not.
02:48:23.68 --> 02:48:24.68 Yeah, negative.
02:48:24.68 --> 02:48:28.68 I know guy 41 and started and it's kind of a,
02:48:28.68 --> 02:48:30.68 a little bit of a handful.
02:48:30.68 --> 02:48:34.68 They do it 41, which, you know, that's not terribly old.
02:48:34.68 --> 02:48:35.68 But it's not terribly old.
02:48:35.68 --> 02:48:37.68 Well, no, actually what surprised me, it's just a handful to deal with.
02:48:37.68 --> 02:48:39.68 That means, because there are some people that,
02:48:39.68 --> 02:48:41.68 whether they're 20 or whether they're 40,
02:48:41.68 --> 02:48:43.68 they just have a little something.
02:48:43.68 --> 02:48:44.68 Yeah.
02:48:44.68 --> 02:48:45.68 They have a little, they have a little,
02:48:45.68 --> 02:48:48.68 some skills, some inherent good instincts.
02:48:48.68 --> 02:48:50.68 There's some inherent strengths.
02:48:50.68 --> 02:48:52.68 Flexibility.
02:48:52.68 --> 02:48:53.68 I got something.
02:48:53.68 --> 02:48:55.68 Yes, it's.
02:48:55.68 --> 02:48:56.68 It's.
02:48:56.68 --> 02:48:58.68 The blend is where everybody in it.
02:48:58.68 --> 02:48:59.68 You can even train hard.
02:48:59.68 --> 02:49:02.68 But if you do, you do have to mine these things.
02:49:02.68 --> 02:49:05.68 Like, okay, I'm not 20 years old anymore.
02:49:05.68 --> 02:49:07.68 I'm 50 years old now.
02:49:07.68 --> 02:49:09.68 So, you got to, you do have to mine those things.
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:09.68 Yeah.
02:49:09.68 --> 02:49:10.68 Not nothing.
02:49:10.68 --> 02:49:10.68 Yeah.
02:49:10.68 --> 02:49:15.68 So, if you're going death matches eight rounds, six minutes.
02:49:15.68 --> 02:49:17.68 Okay, that's again, that's not nothing there either.
02:49:17.68 --> 02:49:19.68 So, but here, good news.

02:50:18.68 --> 02:50:19.68 Which you also need.
02:50:19.68 --> 02:50:21.68 If you're, if you're lifting,
02:50:21.68 --> 02:50:23.68 if you're training, if you're running,
02:50:23.68 --> 02:50:25.68 if you're alive.

02:50:33.68 --> 02:50:36.68 And you still have this little thing in the back.
02:50:36.68 --> 02:50:38.68 You're head that you just need a little.
02:50:38.68 --> 02:50:41.68 A little bit of sweetness, a little bit of that.
02:50:41.68 --> 02:50:43.68 You can just mix it in the ones who better.
02:50:43.68 --> 02:50:46.68 Just mix yourself a one scoop moke.
02:50:46.68 --> 02:50:50.68 And you'll go to bed completely satisfied.
02:50:50.68 --> 02:50:57.68 You feel like, look, I'm completely satisfied with what I've eaten.
02:50:57.68 --> 02:50:58.68 Yes.
02:50:58.68 --> 02:50:59.68 And you're stronger.
02:50:59.68 --> 02:51:00.68 And healthier.
02:51:00.68 --> 02:51:02.68 On your way to recover.
02:51:02.68 --> 02:51:03.68 Yes, too.
02:51:03.68 --> 02:51:05.68 You will not relate to this,
02:51:05.68 --> 02:51:07.68 but people may be able to.
02:51:07.68 --> 02:51:08.68 Okay.
02:51:08.68 --> 02:51:11.68 So, when you get on the path from,
02:51:11.68 --> 02:51:17.68 not being on the path, your initial get on might include quitting drinking,
02:51:17.68 --> 02:51:20.68 cutting down drinking, but probably quitting drinking.
02:51:20.68 --> 02:51:21.68 Okay.
02:51:21.68 --> 02:51:25.68 So, here's a common thing that I heard and experience with quitting drinking,
02:51:25.68 --> 02:51:29.68 where you kind of crave like sweets or like desserts.
02:51:29.68 --> 02:51:31.68 And just something that'll like give you a, like,
02:51:31.68 --> 02:51:34.68 a what a dopamine or whatever the chemical hit.
02:51:34.68 --> 02:51:35.68 Yeah.
02:51:35.68 --> 02:51:36.68 Yeah.
02:51:36.68 --> 02:51:37.68 So, you'll want that.
02:51:37.68 --> 02:51:39.68 Like you want like cookies or stuff.
02:51:39.68 --> 02:51:41.68 Because you're not drinking anymore or whatever.
02:51:41.68 --> 02:51:42.68 That'll be like a result.
02:51:42.68 --> 02:51:43.68 Yep.
02:51:43.68 --> 02:51:45.68 This is what I heard and literally experienced.
02:51:45.68 --> 02:51:48.68 And it's, it was like stronger than I expected to.
02:51:48.68 --> 02:51:51.68 Now, if you have the moke.
02:51:51.68 --> 02:51:53.68 Boom problem solved.
02:51:53.68 --> 02:51:55.68 100% because it does supply that, you know,
02:51:55.68 --> 02:51:58.68 the dessert kind of scenario, but she put some peanut butter.
02:51:58.68 --> 02:52:01.68 But, you know, but there, there, no fact.
02:52:01.68 --> 02:52:03.68 There, you're on the path.
02:52:03.68 --> 02:52:06.68 100% no side effects, no drawbacks.
02:52:06.68 --> 02:52:07.68 Yeah.
02:52:07.68 --> 02:52:09.68 You know, no side effects, no drawbacks.
02:52:09.68 --> 02:52:11.68 If you get the RTD, the ready to drink,
02:52:11.68 --> 02:52:13.68 discipline go in a can.
02:52:13.68 --> 02:52:14.68 RTD.
02:52:14.68 --> 02:52:15.68 Did you speak to them?
02:52:15.68 --> 02:52:16.68 No, no, that's a thing.
02:52:16.68 --> 02:52:17.68 That's a product made.
02:52:17.68 --> 02:52:19.68 It's like, oh, this is an RTD.
02:52:19.68 --> 02:52:20.68 Sounds like you made it up.
02:52:20.68 --> 02:52:21.68 I didn't make it up.
02:52:21.68 --> 02:52:23.68 It's good sounds like you made it up.
02:52:23.68 --> 02:52:24.68 Okay.
02:52:24.68 --> 02:52:26.68 It says it right there on the page.
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:26.68 Oh, yeah.
02:52:26.68 --> 02:52:27.68 High speed low drag RTD.
02:52:27.68 --> 02:52:28.68 Yeah.
02:52:28.68 --> 02:52:29.68 Make it up in RTD.
02:52:29.68 --> 02:52:30.68 No.
02:52:30.68 --> 02:52:33.68 But speaking of that, when, when I was, when I went up to a
02:52:33.68 --> 02:52:36.68 field, on spot cast, and he was drinking it, and he started
02:52:36.68 --> 02:52:38.68 getting that, you know, you start feeling it.
02:52:38.68 --> 02:52:39.68 He's feeling it.
02:52:39.68 --> 02:52:42.68 And he was pretty funny.
02:52:42.68 --> 02:52:45.68 And he says he said something along the lines of, you know,
02:52:45.68 --> 02:52:47.68 I might find myself back on cocaine.
02:52:47.68 --> 02:52:48.68 Yeah.
02:52:48.68 --> 02:52:49.68 That's true.
02:52:49.68 --> 02:52:51.68 So he, he started feeling like the,
02:52:51.68 --> 02:52:53.68 and I said, no, you don't need to go back on cocaine, you know,
02:52:53.68 --> 02:52:55.68 thinking of myself, you know, you can cocaine.
02:52:55.68 --> 02:52:58.68 Just need a little bit more discipline go RTD, yeah.
02:52:58.68 --> 02:53:01.68 Which is not, and it won't make you.
02:53:01.68 --> 02:53:03.68 It won't make you.
02:53:03.68 --> 02:53:05.68 It's not a gateway drug.
02:53:05.68 --> 02:53:06.68 It's not a gateway drug.
02:53:06.68 --> 02:53:09.68 It's not going to make you end up sleeping on a park fence.
02:53:09.68 --> 02:53:10.68 The opposite.
02:53:10.68 --> 02:53:12.68 You might buy the park.
02:53:12.68 --> 02:53:14.68 It's probably going to happen.
02:53:14.68 --> 02:53:15.68 So, too.
02:53:15.68 --> 02:53:18.68 Also, jokow IT, speaking of picking up park benches and whatnot.
02:53:18.68 --> 02:53:19.68 Yeah.
02:53:19.68 --> 02:53:20.68 Talk about T boom.
02:53:20.68 --> 02:53:21.68 And it happens to taste good.
02:53:21.68 --> 02:53:24.68 And it happens to be certified organic.
02:53:24.68 --> 02:53:25.68 You like mentioning that.
02:53:25.68 --> 02:53:26.68 I, yeah, man.
02:53:26.68 --> 02:53:27.68 I do.
02:53:27.68 --> 02:53:29.68 There's a big deal to get that little
02:53:29.68 --> 02:53:31.68 qualification.
02:53:31.68 --> 02:53:32.68 I dig it.
02:53:32.68 --> 02:53:33.68 It's good.
02:53:33.68 --> 02:53:34.68 It's very good actually.
02:53:34.68 --> 02:53:35.68 Because here's the thing.
02:53:35.68 --> 02:53:39.68 Like, yeah, you, well, even when you first, you see people do you think people in Nebraska care,
02:53:39.68 --> 02:53:44.68 if it's certified organic or you think it's only 40 mile radius around L.A.
02:53:44.68 --> 02:53:46.68 I think some people in Nebraska care.
02:53:46.68 --> 02:53:47.68 That's what I think.
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:47.68 Right.
02:53:47.68 --> 02:53:48.68 And this is why.
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:49.68 Where is it?
02:53:49.68 --> 02:53:53.68 Because when you first announced that you're drinking
02:53:53.68 --> 02:53:55.68 pomegranate white tea.
02:53:55.68 --> 02:53:56.68 Oh, yeah.
02:53:56.68 --> 02:53:58.68 People were asking, is it organic?
02:53:58.68 --> 02:53:59.68 Is that what you're going to say?
02:53:59.68 --> 02:54:00.68 That's part of it.
02:54:00.68 --> 02:54:01.68 Yeah.
02:54:01.68 --> 02:54:05.68 Something that whole experience for what primarily is like, all right, that's surprising.
02:54:05.68 --> 02:54:08.68 That doesn't sound very hard core.
02:54:08.68 --> 02:54:11.68 You would think maybe you're drinking something else.
02:54:11.68 --> 02:54:14.68 But when you're like pomegranate white tea.
02:54:14.68 --> 02:54:15.68 Okay.
02:54:15.68 --> 02:54:17.68 Now we can do that or we could edit,
02:54:17.68 --> 02:54:18.68 mid.
02:54:18.68 --> 02:54:21.68 We drink these white teas, which is good.
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:24.68 But a lot of our wives drink white tea.
02:54:24.68 --> 02:54:27.68 And they tend to care about certified organic.
02:54:27.68 --> 02:54:31.68 In my experience, which is very limited by the way.
02:54:31.68 --> 02:54:36.68 So I'm saying pomegranate white tea.
02:54:36.68 --> 02:54:39.68 Jocco white tea is for everybody.
02:54:39.68 --> 02:54:44.68 And just because you're not all, I don't care about certified organic just because you're like that doesn't mean everyone else.
02:54:44.68 --> 02:54:50.68 In fact, I don't think the majority of the people would rather be certified organic than non organic.
02:54:50.68 --> 02:54:51.68 I would agree with that.
02:54:51.68 --> 02:54:56.68 And the root of me drinking pomegranate white tea is when I used to
02:54:56.68 --> 02:55:01.68 debrief seal potions out in the desert.
02:55:01.68 --> 02:55:06.68 After they would get done with their brief and I would drink chocolate to drink and provide a time to get done.
02:55:06.68 --> 02:55:09.68 I don't think he notes and just get into it.
02:55:09.68 --> 02:55:11.68 But yeah, so check that as well.
02:55:11.68 --> 02:55:12.68 It's good.
02:55:12.68 --> 02:55:13.68 Also, jocco is a store.
02:55:13.68 --> 02:55:14.68 It's called jocco store.
02:55:14.68 --> 02:55:16.68 So you go to jocco store.com.
02:55:16.68 --> 02:55:23.68 We do have t-shirts, hoodies, rash guards, hats, three kinds of hats.
02:55:23.68 --> 02:55:26.68 By the way, three types of head gear.
02:55:26.68 --> 02:55:30.68 By the way, women stuff, you know, decals and stickers.
02:55:30.68 --> 02:55:34.68 These are all things if you want to represent while you're on the path.
02:55:34.68 --> 02:55:35.68 Just plenty.
02:55:35.68 --> 02:55:36.68 It was freedom.
02:55:36.68 --> 02:55:38.68 Death core to the core.
02:55:38.68 --> 02:55:39.68 I like it.
02:55:39.68 --> 02:55:41.68 Good.
02:55:41.68 --> 02:55:42.68 All these things.
02:55:42.68 --> 02:55:44.68 And that's one that's going to permeate kind of everything.
02:55:44.68 --> 02:55:45.68 The good.
02:55:45.68 --> 02:55:47.68 You know, when you find the good in this situation, all these things you can represent.
02:55:47.68 --> 02:55:48.68 Get your stuff.
02:55:48.68 --> 02:55:49.68 Jocco store.com.
02:55:49.68 --> 02:55:50.68 He likes something.
02:55:50.68 --> 02:55:51.68 Get something on there.
02:55:51.68 --> 02:55:57.68 Also, I got to mention that I have a little, I have some events I'm going to be doing around
02:55:57.68 --> 02:56:03.68 the country starting in January around the time the book comes out a little bit earlier.
02:56:03.68 --> 02:56:05.68 I'm going to be in Washington, DC, Austin, Texas.
02:56:05.68 --> 02:56:07.68 I'm going to be somewhere in the vicinity of New York.
02:56:07.68 --> 02:56:10.68 I'm going to be somewhere in the vicinity of LA.
02:56:10.68 --> 02:56:15.68 Somewhere in the vicinity of Seattle, Washington and somewhere in the vicinity of San Francisco.
02:56:15.68 --> 02:56:18.68 So I will let you know, but just pay attention.
02:56:18.68 --> 02:56:21.68 I just got an email right before we started recording this.
02:56:21.68 --> 02:56:24.68 That is actually factually happening.
02:56:24.68 --> 02:56:26.68 I don't even know what I'm going to call it yet.
02:56:26.68 --> 02:56:30.68 So I will be live on stage interacting.
02:56:30.68 --> 02:56:32.68 So there you go.
02:56:32.68 --> 02:56:33.68 Boom.
02:56:33.68 --> 02:56:35.68 Also speaking of live.
02:56:35.68 --> 02:56:40.68 But I imagine when I do those live events, there will be lots of people representing.
02:56:40.68 --> 02:56:41.68 Representing.
02:56:41.68 --> 02:56:45.68 They will be representing in their garments.
02:56:45.68 --> 02:56:46.68 Oh, yes.
02:56:46.68 --> 02:56:47.68 Death are on the path.
02:56:47.68 --> 02:56:55.68 We normally see a lot of people that are wearing something that says Deaf Core or in the wild.
02:56:55.68 --> 02:56:56.68 Yeah.
02:56:56.68 --> 02:56:57.68 So there you go.
02:56:57.68 --> 02:56:58.68 Big time.
02:56:58.68 --> 02:57:02.68 Also subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already on your iTunes.

02:57:08.68 --> 02:57:12.68 No, I'm just just delegating the listening avenues.
02:57:12.68 --> 02:57:13.68 I'm saying.
02:57:13.68 --> 02:57:14.68 And leave a review.
02:57:14.68 --> 02:57:16.68 If you're in the mood, if you're in the mood, leave a review.
02:57:16.68 --> 02:57:18.68 We review is a welcome.
02:57:18.68 --> 02:57:21.68 I haven't read reviews lately on the podcast.
02:57:21.68 --> 02:57:22.68 But I've done that before.
02:57:22.68 --> 02:57:23.68 I'll do it again.
02:57:23.68 --> 02:57:24.68 I see some good ones.
02:57:24.68 --> 02:57:26.68 Some ones that kind of nail it.
02:57:26.68 --> 02:57:27.68 Yeah.
02:57:27.68 --> 02:57:28.68 Kind of have layers.
02:57:28.68 --> 02:57:29.68 We're looking for layers.
02:57:29.68 --> 02:57:30.68 Yeah.
02:57:30.68 --> 02:57:31.68 Primarily.
02:57:31.68 --> 02:57:32.68 Yes.
02:57:32.68 --> 02:57:34.68 So and you noticed they said welcome reviews are welcome.
02:57:34.68 --> 02:57:37.68 Because it difference between welcome and accepted.
02:57:37.68 --> 02:57:39.68 So already know reviews are accepted.
02:57:39.68 --> 02:57:40.68 Where do you know you can write review?
02:57:40.68 --> 02:57:41.68 Are they expected?
02:57:41.68 --> 02:57:42.68 You're not expected.
02:57:42.68 --> 02:57:43.68 I wouldn't say it's just well.
02:57:43.68 --> 02:57:44.68 Yeah.
02:57:44.68 --> 02:57:45.68 Well, welcome.
02:57:45.68 --> 02:57:48.68 Meaning like if there's a review, that's like we kind of like that.
02:57:48.68 --> 02:57:53.68 Like we kind of, you know, like we kind of put the smile on certain people's faces.
02:57:53.68 --> 02:57:55.68 And we're going to go ahead and read that one.
02:57:55.68 --> 02:57:59.68 Don't forget that we have another podcast called Grounded.
02:57:59.68 --> 02:58:04.68 It's just a podcast called Grounded where we talk about other things.
02:58:04.68 --> 02:58:08.68 And I think that's the way you said this on the last little support section.
02:58:08.68 --> 02:58:12.68 Because how do you describe what we talk about on Grounded?
02:58:12.68 --> 02:58:15.68 And I think the answer is we talk about other things.
02:58:15.68 --> 02:58:16.68 Yes.
02:58:16.68 --> 02:58:17.68 You know what does that mean?
02:58:17.68 --> 02:58:18.68 Well it's other things.
02:58:18.68 --> 02:58:19.68 I think that's about.
02:58:19.68 --> 02:58:20.68 I think that spells it out.
02:58:20.68 --> 02:58:21.68 Yeah man.
02:58:21.68 --> 02:58:22.68 Yeah.
02:58:22.68 --> 02:58:23.68 As opposed to what?
02:58:23.68 --> 02:58:24.68 These things.
02:58:24.68 --> 02:58:25.68 It's not these things.
02:58:25.68 --> 02:58:26.68 There's more other things.
02:58:26.68 --> 02:58:27.68 Yeah.
02:58:27.68 --> 02:58:28.68 Yeah.
02:58:28.68 --> 02:58:29.68 Equally important things.
02:58:29.68 --> 02:58:31.68 Well, very important.
02:58:31.68 --> 02:58:34.68 Maybe not equally important.
02:58:34.68 --> 02:58:35.68 Interesting.
02:58:35.68 --> 02:58:36.68 Yes.
02:58:36.68 --> 02:58:37.68 I think.
02:58:37.68 --> 02:58:40.68 And here's something that is important.
02:58:40.68 --> 02:58:43.68 I will say this.
02:58:43.68 --> 02:58:52.68 Even though they might not be of equal importance, they are things that will grant you a better understanding,
02:58:52.68 --> 02:58:54.68 a broader understanding of things.
02:58:54.68 --> 02:58:55.68 Yes.
02:58:55.68 --> 02:58:56.68 Of other things.
02:58:56.68 --> 02:59:01.68 The more you understand other things, the more you'll understand these things.
02:59:01.68 --> 02:59:02.68 That is true.
02:59:02.68 --> 02:59:03.68 Yeah.
02:59:03.68 --> 02:59:04.68 Very well put.
02:59:04.68 --> 02:59:05.68 Thanks.
02:59:05.68 --> 02:59:06.68 You need to change whatever that little.
02:59:06.68 --> 02:59:07.68 You know how that.
02:59:07.68 --> 02:59:09.68 You know, a podcast has a little.
02:59:09.68 --> 02:59:11.68 No blurb about what it's about.
02:59:11.68 --> 02:59:13.68 I don't think you've changed the jockel podcast.
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:16.68 Once you wrote it when you were nine years old.
02:59:16.68 --> 02:59:22.68 But you should make the ground to one say a podcast about other things.
02:59:22.68 --> 02:59:23.68 Yeah.
02:59:23.68 --> 02:59:24.68 All right.
02:59:24.68 --> 02:59:25.68 I'm going to do that.
02:59:25.68 --> 02:59:26.68 I do too.
02:59:26.68 --> 02:59:29.68 So for example, Jason Gardner talking about how he lives up in the mountains.
02:59:29.68 --> 02:59:35.68 And when they go jogging, they got to carry guns just in case they get a fact by freaking mountain lions.
02:59:35.68 --> 02:59:37.68 Those are other things we talk about.
02:59:37.68 --> 02:59:39.68 That's a sense of the meaning.
02:59:39.68 --> 02:59:41.68 But it's important to understand that.
02:59:41.68 --> 02:59:42.68 Yes.
02:59:42.68 --> 02:59:44.68 We also have a warrior kid podcast.
02:59:44.68 --> 02:59:50.68 This is a great podcast not just for kids, but if you're a parent, you can use it to help you parent.
02:59:50.68 --> 02:59:52.68 But you can also learn from it.
02:59:52.68 --> 02:59:54.68 I am a parent.
02:59:54.68 --> 02:59:56.68 I got four kids.
02:59:56.68 --> 03:00:02.68 Two of which are over the age of 18, 20, 18, got a 16 year old and got a 10 year old.

03:00:10.68 --> 03:00:12.68 I wish I would have this podcast with my kids, re-honger.
03:00:12.68 --> 03:00:14.68 But warrior kid podcast, let your kids check it out.
03:00:14.68 --> 03:00:16.68 And don't forget to get yourself some warrior kid.

03:00:36.68 --> 03:00:39.68 There's a rough transition in the chat once.

03:01:07.68 --> 03:01:08.68 permeation.

03:01:10.68 --> 03:01:13.68 That's the prevalence of smart TVs.
03:01:13.68 --> 03:01:15.68 This is what I'm saying.
03:01:15.68 --> 03:01:18.68 You're good at more YouTube is what I'm saying.

03:02:42.68 --> 03:02:43.68 So we just reviewed that.
03:02:43.68 --> 03:02:45.68 It's an outstanding book.
03:02:45.68 --> 03:02:47.68 There's all kinds of information in there.
03:02:47.68 --> 03:02:49.68 I only read a small percentage of it.
03:02:49.68 --> 03:02:53.68 But tons of knowledge.
03:02:53.68 --> 03:02:54.68 So order that.
03:02:54.68 --> 03:02:57.68 You can find it on jaco.pondcast dot com.
