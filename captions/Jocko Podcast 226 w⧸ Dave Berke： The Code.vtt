00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Jocco podcast number 226 with echo Charles and me, Jocco willing. Good evening, I go. Good evening.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And also joining us tonight is Dave Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Alright, so almost a year ago. Almost a year ago, I put out a podcast.

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Podcasts number 174 and it was about the evaluation system that's used in the Marine Corps.

5
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I talked about the evaluation system that's used in the Navy.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And you might want to go and listen to podcast 174 first before you continue listening to this podcast.

7
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But I wouldn't say it's mandatory.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But in that podcast, I told a story and it was about a guy that worked for me and he came to me because he didn't have the highest grades on the evaluation.

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The Navy evaluation system, the grades go from 1 to 5, 5 being the best, 1 being the worst.

10
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And you know, he was like an average guy, you know, 3.3 or 3.6, something like that.

11
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But he thought he should have been better.

12
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so he came to me, he set up a meeting, you know, which was kind of weird because most people didn't set up meetings to see me.

13
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
They were just coming to see me.

14
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But he set up a meeting with the admin department to come see me and, you know, thought he thought he should have been 5.0 and a lot of stuff.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And so as I'm talking to him, I'm kind of thinking, how can I explain to this guy that he's not 5.0.

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so what I ended up doing was reading him some of the bullets that would, some of the bullet points that would make you a 5.0.

17
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
How they describe a 5.0 sailor.

18
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Things like going to the document here, professional knowledge, recognized expert sawed out by all for technical knowledge.

19
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Use his knowledge to solve complex technical problems, meet PQS advancement requirements early and with distinction.

20
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Like they think about that.

21
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Recognized expert sawed out by all.

22
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But that means no one is above you in terms of expertise in your field.

23
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And I'm looking at this guy who, like I said, was a strong average.

24
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And as I said that to him, he realized that wasn't him.

25
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And then it was like quality of work needs no supervision.

26
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Always produces exceptional work, no rework required maximizes resources.

27
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, think about these terms, always and exceptional.

28
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There's not too many people that that's what you need to be to be in 5.0 category.

29
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Always produce exceptional work.

30
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
That's not hey, these 4 out of 5 projects were really good.

31
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We're exceptional even.

32
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
No, it's 5 for 5.

33
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
You know, who is doing this?

34
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Who does 5 for 5 like that?

35
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Not this guy.

36
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Military bearing in character.

37
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What does it take to be a 5.0 in military bearing in character?

38
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This exemplary personal experience model of conduct on and off duty, leader in physical readiness, exemplifies Navy core values honor, courage and commitment.

39
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Let's just face it when it comes to the word honor.

40
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There's your throne that out there and you're saying, hey, I'm a, I'm the maximum grade in honor.

41
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That's a bold statement.

42
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I'm not too many people are running around making that statement.

43
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And then there's the leadership bullet to be a 5.0 in leadership in the Navy.

44
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You have to, you have to achieve the following inspiring motivator and trainer, subordinates reach highest level of growth and development, superb organizer, great foresight,

45
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
develops process improvements and efficiencies.

46
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Leadership achievements dramatically further command mission and vision perseveres through the toughest challenges and inspires all the

47
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and inspires others, exceptional communicator, make subordinates safety conscious, maintain top safety record, constantly improves the personal and professional lives of others.

48
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Come on.

49
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
That's that's legit, right?

50
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And you know, so after reading this guy all through this different criteria, he realized he wasn't a 5.0 sailor.

51
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And then on that podcast, 174, I went deep into the Marine Corps evaluation system, which is a superior document.

52
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It's a superior document.

53
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And I was looking at him today, you know, that the Navy one is front and back.

54
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It's two pages.

55
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's front and back.

56
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The Marine Corps one is six pages.

57
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
So three pages, front and back.

58
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
More comprehensive.

59
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And what it does, it does a similar thing, which is set like the ultimate standard for the world.

60
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And what it does is, it's a standard for what the highest level qualified Marine would be.

61
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And they have this Christmas tree thing that I talked about on podcast 174 and it's at the highest level.

62
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
There's a one that would be like the star on the Christmas tree.

63
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And then as you get into the middle of the categories, there's more more Marines.

64
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Because there's more Marines that are, you know, high average and there's even more that are just average Marines.

65
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But then the funny thing is the bottom of the Christmas tree, it's not a bell curve.

66
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
It's not like even on both ends.

67
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
At the lowest ranking Marine or the lowest ranked Marine, there's just one of them.

68
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Like loser Marines is a very small category.

69
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But what they describe that one person, that one Marine at the top, they describe that Marine as the eminently qualified Marine.

70
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Very powerful document.

71
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And it does like sets out in no uncertain terms, the quality of behaviors that a Marine has to exemplify in order to be a eminently qualified Marine.

72
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And you know, I actually, I think I originally called you Dave to say,

73
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Did I talk to you about this in a body and ended up not being new here like nine ever talked to you about that?

74
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I was in the brigade tactical operation center and I was in there for whatever.

75
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I was, you're talking to, it must have been, it was obviously it was another Marine who was sitting there writing, writing e-vails for someone.

76
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's probably my boss.

77
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Yeah, and he was sitting there doing whatever.

78
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And I started, I just picked up the document, we were talking about whatever.

79
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And I just, immediately, I'd never look at one before.

80
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And as soon as that's all the eminently qualified Marine, I'm putting this together.

81
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You can see the wheels are spinning in my hand like this is legit.

82
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And I talked to you about it.

83
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And the fact of the matter is that in order to become something,

84
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Well, then you have to have clear guidance on what you need to do to become that thing.

85
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And so that's what we covered on that podcast and I closed out by talking about the fact that we as people,

86
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
as human beings, don't really have any documentation like that.

87
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It doesn't really exist.

88
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And that was a big thing that I learned as a young seal.

89
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It was the first time that somebody sat me down and read those descriptions to me.

90
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I said, yeah, you know what?

91
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I got some room to grow.

92
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But it wasn't until I saw what the highest level qualification was that I realized I had room to go.

93
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Because you know, you're 22 years old.

94
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you think you're awesome until you see what awesome actually is like.

95
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So, before I even recorded that podcast,

96
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
when I talked to you, David, and I was like, hey,

97
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
was this you and you're like, I don't think so.

98
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I said, well, we're probably going to have to do something with us.

99
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Yeah, because this is going to leave a mark on people.

100
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And then it did.

101
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And it's, I've been got more old.

102
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So, incredible amount of feedback on that podcast.

103
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
People have done podcasts about that podcast.

104
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And I told you that we were going to have to do something to,

105
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
to assemble some kind of document where people could grade themselves,

106
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
to try and become an eminently qualified human being.

107
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And that was over.

108
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
That was almost a year ago.

109
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We have been eminant failures at getting it done.

110
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But the weight is over.

111
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And it is now available on Amazon.

112
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It is called the code, the evaluation in the protocols,

113
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
which is, and it look, I was going to say it's a weird name for a book.

114
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
But it's actually, it's maybe not fully classified as a book.

115
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Maybe it's a handbook.

116
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Because it's not super long.

117
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It's not some grand articulation.

118
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But I did add, we had to start with the code, the evaluations.

119
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And then added the protocols in that allow someone to try and realize what it is like.

120
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
To create a vision of what of the human that you want to be.

121
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And on the first podcast, I only talked about evaluations.

122
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But then as we put this together, I started thinking to myself that in order to follow evaluations,

123
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you need objectives to achieve.

124
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
You need some kind of rules.

125
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You need some kind of code.

126
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And you know part of this is from the fact that I wrote away the warrior kid

127
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and the warrior kid.

128
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I got all kinds of feedback about the warrior kid code, including that one guy that wrote the,

129
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
one of the few things I've read on the podcast, which was, remember the guy that wrote,

130
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
hey, I've lost this much weight and I've got a promotion and he turned his life around.

131
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And then at the end he said, and the book I read was,

132
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
where the warrior kid.

133
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So, look, and I explained this way of the warrior kid that,

134
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the warrior cultures have codes that they try and live by.

135
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And I did the codes from the Rangers and the Marine Corps and the Seal teams and the Cota Bashito and the Cota Shivery.

136
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And there's a reason that those codes existed.

137
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And the code that I wrote there for the way the warrior kid is a kid's code,

138
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but the book encourages kids to make their own code.

139
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And this book does the same thing.

140
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But this gives you a place to start.

141
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So, we came up with a general categories to evaluate your progress towards this code.

142
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And then the last part is about the protocols.

143
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And again, this was just another thing that kind of came out of the podcast of me talking about protocols.

144
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And I think the first time I talked about, we need a protocol.

145
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
People need a protocol was you break up with your girlfriend.

146
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And I went on this thing and I said, here's the protocol.

147
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
You order pizza, you get extra cheese and sausage, you take two days of being miserable,

148
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
you complain about it to your friends.

149
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And then you get up, you work out, you move on.

150
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You know, like, here's a protocol that you follow.

151
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And a bunch of people were saying, yes, we need a protocol.

152
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And I've also talked about the protocols.

153
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The fact that in America, since we have so many different cultures, all mixed together,

154
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
we don't really have a good protocol anymore for deaf.

155
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And so when someone dies, you know, in some places in the world,

156
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I always think of Ireland, that they have a protocol.

157
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Like, you're going to go to this pub, you're going to go to this wake,

158
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you're going to perform this religious service, you're going to do this.

159
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
They go through that protocol and then they move on.

160
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And different religions have that, but in America, since we have all this,

161
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
everyone kind of consolidated together, we lost some of that.

162
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And so there's some, sometimes people don't know what the protocol is when someone dies.

163
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So there's another situation where something happens, and it would be really good if you could follow a protocol.

164
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So we added some protocols to get people through certain scenarios in life and Dave,

165
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and then Sarah Armstrong as well, who is a friend of mine, a very successful business woman,

166
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
a very successful business leader, and a long time, just old school.

167
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Oh, gee, trooper.

168
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Straight up.

169
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And y'all, helping put this together, and we ended up with this book.

170
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So what did I miss Dave?

171
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
No, that's it, man.

172
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I mean, when we first did the podcast, I think we had the sense that we were just kind of kind of replicate that.

173
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And as we started to really dig into what this looked like, we realized,

174
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
we need to have something else in it.

175
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
That's where the protocols really came from is this sort of tells you what you can be,

176
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
but we realized as a whole bunch of things you have to do.

177
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And it was pretty cool, look, there's no way it should have taken me this long.

178
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
But we did figure out along the way, there was more and you did to go into that.

179
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We needed to write a code, and we needed to figure out what some of those protocols are to help people understand the things they needed to do.

180
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So here we are, 11 months later.

181
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I guess we've been a busy and instead of prioritizing an executing properly, we failed.

182
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So anyways, here we go.

183
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The book, let's go to the book.

184
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The book is called the code, the evaluation, the protocols,

185
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
striving to become an eminently qualified human.

186
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So the book is out on publishing company called,

187
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Djokko publishing.

188
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And what's cool about that is look, we turned it.

189
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.000
If this was a normal publishing route to the year, it took us to get it done, added another year.

190
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So the other thing that's cool about it is when you open the front cover, it says first a dish.

191
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Literally it says first a dish.

192
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
See, how could you tell?

193
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yes, so we got first a dish and let's roll into it.

194
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It starts off the first section, it's called the code.

195
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And the whole book is less than 100 pages and not a ton of writing, not needed.

196
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
The code, here we go.

197
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
The objective, the objective will not be reached without a goal, the goal will not be achieved without a standard.

198
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
It will not be met without a mission, the mission cannot be accomplished.

199
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Without an ideal, the ideal will never be realized without a clear path.

200
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
The path cannot be followed.

201
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Now that's pretty simple and straightforward, but how many people do you know that are going through life without an objective without a goal without a standard without a mission without an ideal without a path?

202
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Right, they're everywhere, they're everywhere.

203
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So continuing yet, we as human beings often go through life without any of these.

204
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And so we wander, we wander aimlessly without making, moving without making any progress.

205
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Days, months and years pass us by.

206
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Time is wasted, which means life is wasted.

207
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.000
You don't think about that, do you?

208
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
That when you waste time, you're wasting life.

209
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And when was it I was talking about the fact that I don't know when I was talking about this.

210
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Maybe it was on the podcast, maybe it was to a client.

211
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But if you take all this time that you wasted and you were able to physically pile it up and see it.

212
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And how you feel sick to your stomach after two or three years to see just this pile of wasted time.

213
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So when we waste time, life is wasted and potential is wasted.

214
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Our own potential squandered, meandering through life instead of becoming who we could be instead of attaining our highest possible manifestation of being.

215
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
We simply become whatever we become.

216
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We fall short in so many ways we fall short.

217
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Well that's what happens.

218
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
That's what happens.

219
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Happens to all kinds of people.

220
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Happens to me.

221
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Where I fail to do what I should be able to do.

222
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
You know what I was thinking about this the other day.

223
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:44.000
If you got something in your head, if you've got some idea in your head, some thought, some dream, some thing that you want to create.

224
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And you don't execute on that, that is a mortal sin.

225
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Think about that.

226
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:02.000
You got something in your head, you got some idea, you got you got this thought that wants to come out, but you don't have the discipline to get it out.

227
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And you let this thing die inside your head.

228
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
That is a mortal sin.

229
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
That's my opinion.

230
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
You got to get it out.

231
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Sorry little tangent there.

232
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
That's what I think about though.

233
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Just the saying when we wrote this is you simply become whatever we become is such a failure to think that if we don't do that thing you just described.

234
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
We just become, well I don't know what we become.

235
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
We become whatever.

236
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And I think part of the reason I got, I think I got more feedback on 174 that podcast and more people reach out and ask about it than any of the podcast we did.

237
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Because this, that struck a chord with people, but you were even on it.

238
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
You had mentioned the Marine Corps and how does the Marine Corps do this?

239
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
People were asking me and I think very shortly after you mentioned we were going to do something about it.

240
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I think people, I mentioned it on the podcast.

241
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
People were asking how do I download the Marine Corps, like Google Marine Corps performance evaluation.

242
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
But I was getting questions all the time about that podcast because people wanted to know how the Marine Corps did this and making the connection between that and themselves.

243
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Because I think this idea of if you don't become what you're going to become you're going to become whatever.

244
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:35.000
And there actually is criteria out there, which was the crazy part as we put a little thought into this was how many people, how many times have I just done whatever I did, which sucks so bad to think about that.

245
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Yeah, and this book right here, this little 96 page or whatever it is book, right?

246
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
To not put this out is wrong totally.

247
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It's wrong. It's wrong. We had to put it out.

248
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
And you know what? It's not easy. It's a pain. There's a bunch of iterations. You're sending me edits.

249
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
You know, it's all just a pain, right?

250
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
But if you let it sit there and just die, you're wrong. You're committing a sin.

251
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah, and not just for yourself, but for your family, for the people who are at you for God knows how many number of people that could actually benefit from that.

252
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Yeah, from that effort you put into creating something that won't just help you, but it could help everybody.

253
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yeah, and you know what, I guess what must scare people is they might think, well, you know, what if I do this?

254
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Actually, this is probably more than excuse than anything else of, well, what if I do this and no one really likes it?

255
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
And I've said that some people, some people say, I really want to start a podcast.

256
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And then they'll say something like, or I really want to write a book. And they say, but you know, I'm really not sure if anyone would be interested in it or whatever.

257
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And always say, if you're writing it or you're recording it, so that other people will listen to it, you're already starting off on the bad foot.

258
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Because if that's your, look, you need to write it for write it or record it or do whatever, because it wants to come out because you need to get it out there.

259
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
And then the world can judge it however the world judges it, which is fine.

260
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
And if you get told, hey, yeah, the thing you wrote, it was pretty dumb.

261
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Then you go, okay, lesson learned. Maybe that was a bad idea.

262
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
You know, I know some of the ideas that you let out of your head echo Charles to me sometimes.

263
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Sometimes they take some abuse, just or they do.

264
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Well, actually, I mean, in a way that's kind of what I was thinking when you're saying that, I was like, yeah, it's a sin to come out.

265
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
But like, well, what if it's like, because in my mind, it has like a non-regid approval process.

266
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
So it comes, you know, it comes, expand, which I don't ask you to do very often.

267
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Can I make it for ask you again?

268
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Like I said, non-regid. So you, you know, you come up with an idea, you get reminded of something or, oh, it's my ear.

269
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Whatever. And then you're like, oh, yeah, that'd be cool if I did this.

270
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And then it hits like a first, the first small road blocking, like, okay, that's not a good idea.

271
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Like kind of the realism of the world kind of introduces itself and idea kind of fizzles.

272
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
But what if it passes that, you know, in your little mind or whatever, or in my case, my little mind, and it comes.

273
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And it actually like has like, you get positive feedback.

274
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Like maybe you tell your wife about it.

275
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
She's like, oh, that sounds like a real thing.

276
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Oh, no, not even there.

277
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Yeah, I think that's like the third layer.

278
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Whatever the second layer is kind of like you kind of think of all the criteria and all the elements of the world that that need to fit in place for this to be a good idea.

279
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
It's like, oh, yeah, it's kind of clicking, you know.

280
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
You can kind of see the success, you know, on the future kind of in your head.

281
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Then, okay, that's another layer.

282
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Okay, it passes that.

283
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Most of the ideas to be honest don't even pass that.

284
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Yeah.

285
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Well, you tell me about this because you have a bank of ideas, you know, videos that you started for the most part, right?

286
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
It started this video and then you say you have a bank of them.

287
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And some of them you go, you go back to them and you say,

288
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I, you know, that was a pretty good idea, but it failed here or sometimes you say,

289
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I'm going to carry through with this idea.

290
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Yeah.

291
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
And yeah, exactly.

292
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
And there's a lot of those little crates like now you could, I could look at them and be like, okay, that was.

293
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
That would be like, okay, that was a good idea for that time, but if I finished this now,

294
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I won't land now.

295
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
That would be like, everyone be like, oh, that's kind of old school concept kind of thing.

296
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And yeah, it's a whole spectrum of things.

297
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
There's probably more videos and stuff like that than in that bank.

298
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So I guess, I guess maybe you don't need, maybe if you don't produce, like,

299
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
you don't have to finish the thing, but you got to at least get it out there into the world.

300
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I don't know. I think you kind of got to finish.

301
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Well, I think you're correct at the end of the day.

302
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And as long as it gets like through those however many layers, yeah, I'm sure we all have different layers of approval in our own head.

303
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
But then as long as it passes kind of that one standard layer that it needs to pass, you know,

304
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
you know, the one where you're like, you know what?

305
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
At the end of the day, you stop thinking about it, but before you stop thinking about it,

306
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
you came to the decision, okay, that is, in fact, a good idea.

307
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Maybe not a level of five good idea, but even like a level three, a doable level three, you know,

308
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
once it gets to that level, and then you don't do it, then yes, I agree.

309
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Okay, percent, it's a sin.

310
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Interesting. And then that's interesting how you're like, even if it ends up not being a good idea.

311
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And it gets judgment by the world, whatever, like the fact that it's out, like that is the reason.

312
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
It's true. That's true for everything. That's true for your own face, really.

313
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Like what? Like you got in the world. Everyone's going to look at what you got, what you have to get to the world,

314
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
and they're going to evaluate it. That's just the way it goes. If people don't like your nose, then they don't like your nose.

315
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
What? Should you not have been born?

316
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I don't think so.

317
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
But nonetheless, you're a fathomically shaking your head over their Dave.

318
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Wait, I think something you said earlier, it really doesn't have any to do with whether or not you produce this for the world to consume it.

319
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
If you got an idea in your head, and there's something in it, and look, I know what it feels like,

320
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000
how the idea is in your head, you have to get that thing out. Whether anybody else, you're brain, your body actually needs it.

321
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
That is like exercise. That is a thing that you need to do.

322
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And if you share it with somebody, that really has nothing to do with the part where you need to get that thing out of your head.

323
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
You got to squeeze your brain and get something out. And you know what? If it goes to somebody else, that's awesome.

324
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But that's like saying, hey, you know what? I don't need to work out today, or I don't need to rest today.

325
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Or I don't need to eat healthy today. If you got something in your head that's an idea, you have to exercise your brain to get that thing out.

326
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
What does what? Where it goes next? You can talk about it all day, but yeah, any time you don't do that,

327
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
you said it might be an excuse. They're all excuse us.

328
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Yeah, you know, you said squeezing your brain and then echo repeated it because I've had separate conversations with both of you guys about squeezing your brain.

329
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Right, because the ideas they're in there, but they sometimes you need to squeeze your brain to get them to come out.

330
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
You've got to put a little work in. Yeah. So I've got to put a lot of work in.

331
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Yeah, that's the calendar to the common, you know, I was an advocate of this, by the way, or if it's like, hey, if it's not coming to you, then it's just not it's time.

332
00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Yeah, you know, you just not ready for it quite yet, you know, kind of thing and my solution to quote writers block.

333
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Yeah, just keep writing. Just write right down. Yep. Oh, you can't figure out that idea.

334
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I'll write around it and you'll figure it out. Yeah.

335
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
We'll tension there.

336
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
So we get to the code. Here's the code.

337
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:30.000
One, I will take care of my physical health by exercising, eating properly and getting the rest I need to recover and rebuild.

338
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I will take care of my physical surroundings, keeping them in order.

339
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Does it strike anyone estranged to start with the physical?

340
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Oh, sir. I have a real easy answer for anyone that says, well, you know, your, your brain is paramount.

341
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
If your body's not working, your brain isn't.

342
00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
So number one thing, take care of your physical health too.

343
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I will develop myself mentally by reading, writing, drawing, building, creating and engaging in other activities that sharpen and expand my mind.

344
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Three, I will not waste time. Time is precious.

345
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Four, I will not waste money and I will make prudent financial decisions. Money is hard to earn.

346
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Five, I will set goals that I will strive toward.

347
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Six, I will excel in my job because work is integral to life.

348
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Seven, I will be humble and not allow my ego to negatively impact my decisions.

349
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Eight, I will control my emotions and not allow my emotions to negatively impact my decisions.

350
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Nine, I will put others before myself.

351
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I will help other people and protect those that cannot protect themselves.

352
00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I will take care of my friends and family and treat other people with respect.

353
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Ten, I will be ready to protect my friends and family.

354
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
My gear will be ready. I will train and prepare to defend myself and others.

355
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Let's go.

356
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
And I just kind of, well, I guess I kind of covered here.

357
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Look, it says that this code is not perfectly suited to everyone.

358
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
But it is not unaltyable. You can modify it if needed.

359
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Customize it for you and your life.

360
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
While it isn't perfect, it's a good place to start.

361
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And while we may never be able to live up to this code, we will be better for having tried.

362
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Now, I don't, I have a hard time conceiving of someone that would look at any of these things in the code and be like,

363
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Yeah, I don't agree with that one.

364
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Is there anything that you can say, well, don't know about that.

365
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Yeah, no. That doesn't mean it has to be exactly like this and your code can be what you wanted to be.

366
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
But there's nothing in here you would look at and go, humility doesn't apply to me.

367
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And actually, if you're, if you look at this and you're thinking that, that flag, red flag.

368
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Red flag.

369
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
We're actually, we started talking about this part of it. We're on a plane.

370
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I think we're actually maybe headed in Australia. We're sitting together on a plane and we're talking about,

371
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Hey, we need to write the code itself as it is. You know what's talking about, the warrior kid code.

372
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And it came from this idea what you were talking about before, which was if we don't,

373
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
if we're out on the path, we just become whatever we become.

374
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
But that's not how it has to be.

375
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
It doesn't, that is not your, you're not predestined to just become whatever you can actually control in a lot of ways.

376
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
What you become and what path you get on, but you need to, you need to know how to do that.

377
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
You need to code to tell you how to do that.

378
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
This is less about doing the specific thing that we're talking about and more about having a code that defines who you are.

379
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
So you are on some path.

380
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yeah.

381
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Because if you're not on some path and your path is different than your path and different than my path.

382
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
But if you're not on a path, you are destined to become whatever.

383
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Yeah.

384
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
And that, that is not okay.

385
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Yeah.

386
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And from a decentralized command perspective, look, my troops in the field can make a decision on what they're going to do based on the overall commanders intent.

387
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
But we go through life with no, not understanding our own commanders intent of our life.

388
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:25.000
So if you take this and you need to make decisions about your life, this just gives you the broad framework to say, you know what?

389
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I'm not going to, I should, should I, should I look at another Netflix show right now or should I go and work?

390
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I'm going to, should I do something productive?

391
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Well, I will not waste time.

392
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Time is precious. Okay. I know what decision to make there.

393
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Hey, I want to buy this frivolous, you know, whatever new, what do you buy at Goldchain?

394
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:56.000
New Goldchain, right? You, you, you could now, you could say, well, you like I really want it and it looks really cool or whatever.

395
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
And then you say, you know what?

396
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
I will not waste money and I will make prudent financial decisions. Yeah, I don't need the Goldchain.

397
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Like there's a, understanding your own commanders intent and having that as a friend.

398
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Having that as a framework to make your decisions on allows you to make good decisions all the time.

399
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Should I have this donut?

400
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
No, sir. Right. I mean, I'm going to take care of my physical health.

401
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Should I, should I drink this whiskey?

402
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Well, that's debatable, but yeah, man, that dig it.

403
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Wait, wait, wait, what was that answer?

404
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
I'm just saying, is that kind of like, you know, when you're playing a plane like your instruments?

405
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000
You're avoiding the question. That goes, Charles.

406
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
What are we drinking?

407
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
I want to see that connection between me flying and playing with my instruments.

408
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
I like to see where those go.

409
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
So we'll see where those go.

410
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
You see what I'm saying.

411
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I'm saying that. Okay, whiskey, you know,

412
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
maybe if you're building cohesiveness within a team,

413
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:06.000
sure, you know, it could apply, you seem saying, or let's say you're a writer, which I'm not by the way, so this hypothetical.

414
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And you do it to facilitate your creative process.

415
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
I would question that.

416
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Yeah.

417
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Very sternly.

418
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Sure.

419
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I would say that that's not going to help you.

420
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I don't know.

421
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
And I say you might want to check your code.

422
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Wait, who's the guy who's the writer?

423
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
He's like a prolific, like super famous writer who just drink whiskey all the time or something.

424
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Or just have it.

425
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Yeah, I think it was Hemingley.

426
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
I don't know. Someone talks.

427
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
I don't think that's actually true.

428
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I don't know.

429
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
But I think that I like to believe that.

430
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I think that people are going to push back the heart.

431
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
People who just brings out with a shotgun.

432
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Let's lay it. Let's lay off the way.

433
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Everyone's path is different.

434
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
The people are going to push back the heartess or the people that are drinking.

435
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
The reality is, there's actually a code that can ask you can ask yourself, should I be doing this right now?

436
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Yeah.

437
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
That's the point.

438
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Understand.

439
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Going on, like I said, what we may never live up to this code, we will be better for having tried.

440
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
We will get stronger, faster, smarter.

441
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
We will build a better career.

442
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
We will be better.

443
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Mother's father's husband's wives, daughters, and sons.

444
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
We will be healthier.

445
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Our lives will be better.

446
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And we will make the lives of those around us better.

447
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Pretty straightforward.

448
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Yeah.

449
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
And you can look at that code and say, well, you should have said this or you should have said that.

450
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
It's like, look at them.

451
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
And if you feel like there's something that needs to be added, cool.

452
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Add to your code.

453
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
If there's something that you just vehemently disagree with, cool.

454
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Subtract.

455
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
But set yourself up.

456
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Set yourself up with a commander's intent.

457
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Set yourself up with a code that you can follow that can guide your decision-making process.

458
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And by the way, will you set it up for yourself?

459
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Why not share it with your family?

460
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
So your family can kind of all be moving in the same direction.

461
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
You and I've interacted with literally thousands and thousands of people.

462
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Just in the last year.

463
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Thousands of people have interacted.

464
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And not everyone is healthy.

465
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Not everyone's doing the right thing.

466
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Not everyone is on the path.

467
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
But it's almost universal that people want to be.

468
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
That they want to be.

469
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And this is what allows them to, like, I can actually control that fate just a little bit more.

470
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
And a thousand people that they all want their lives to be better.

471
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
They all want their families lives to be better.

472
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
There's just this crazy idea that there was something that seemed as simple as that.

473
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
What was missing was just the recognition of how to start to do that.

474
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
It wasn't to try to convince people that they should.

475
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
It was more to explain people how they can.

476
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And close in that gap between what they want and what they are.

477
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Was that there was something in the middle was telling them how to do it.

478
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Or how to even think about how to do it.

479
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
You're talking about your own commanders intent.

480
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
That's a really powerful way to describe what you're doing is like, what is your own commanders intent for yourself?

481
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
It was never a question to people want their lives.

482
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Almost everybody wants their lives to be better and healthier.

483
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
And the people around that better.

484
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
It was not having that understanding your own mind.

485
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
What you need to do for yourself to do that.

486
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000
And you probably hear me talk about the, the German, you know, decentralized command,

487
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
talking about Americans, briefs and how we have, you know, 120 slides in a brief.

488
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And then the last slide is the commanders intent.

489
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
That's as this is what I really want done.

490
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And the German general saying the, the commanders intent shouldn't be unadendem to all those different slides.

491
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
It should replace them.

492
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
And so anything you can say about, hey, you know, we could write a book about a book.

493
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
How to be healthy, right?

494
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Like, he, here's what you need to do.

495
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Here's your workout, all those things.

496
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
You can write all that stuff down.

497
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:52.000
But the most important thing is hey, you need to make decisions that lean towards good health.

498
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:03.000
That's, you can replace every exercise book and every self-help book with the underlying personal commanders intent of what you're trying to do.

499
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
And it'll solve many, many of your problems.

500
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Yeah, for sure.

501
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And that goes with financial, that goes with your work, all those things.

502
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
If you're going to work with the attitude of like,

503
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I'm going to do a good job.

504
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
That's, just think of that commanders intent.

505
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
I'm going to do a good, I'm going to do a good job at my work.

506
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000
That's, that's my goal.

507
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
You know, I was talking about this on Jockel Live a lot.

508
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I'm not a lot, but I think one or two of the shows this came up where I got to talking about when I got to the seal teams.

509
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:45.000
One of the things that just changed my life and made everything go so well was this idea.

510
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
And the idea was as a 19 year old, I had this idea in my head.

511
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
And the idea was, I want to be a good seal.

512
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Just I want to be a good seal. That's what I want to do.

513
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And then every decision that I'm making is, is this going to make me a good seal.

514
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
And as soon as I had that as my underlying kind of decision making process,

515
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
I started moving in a direction.

516
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
And so lucky is very lucky for me because otherwise I got all this energy.

517
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
As a young kid, you know, I was a really horrible young kid.

518
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And I was crazy.

519
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
I got all kinds of trouble and caused all kinds of trouble.

520
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
And the minute I took all that energy and turned it to one thing,

521
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I want to be a good seal.

522
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
And it took me some time to figure out what a good seal was.

523
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
And I made some errors along the way for sure.

524
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
But when I was trying to be a good seal, and then I always said I did something that was wrong.

525
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
And it was making me not a good seal.

526
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
I could just correct it because I was like, this doesn't seem like this is being a good seal.

527
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So you apply that to all these different elements of your life,

528
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
to your physical health, to your mental health, to not procrastinating,

529
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
to be, you know, being a good worker, to take care of your family, to be in prepared.

530
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:04.000
And we wrote this by the way way before, you know, COVID-19, right?

531
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And now all of a sudden people are, man, I wish I was a little bit more prepared.

532
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Yes, yes, you should be prepared.

533
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:19.000
So to get better, continue along with the book, and to do that, we must strive.

534
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
We must strive to be better in the things that matter.

535
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:35.000
The code sets a standard, the highest possible standard, the highest possible standard reveals and delineates the path we must follow.

536
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And then it gets into what is the path?

537
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:45.000
The path is how you become what you want to be, who you want to be, and what the world needs you to be.

538
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
It is how you reach your potential.

539
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
It is the path of discipline that leads to freedom.

540
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
The path is a war against weakness, so it leads to strength, it's a war against ignorance,

541
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
so it leads to knowledge of war against confusion, so it delivers understanding.

542
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
That is the path of life.

543
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And I've got an ask you, because I was talking about the path.

544
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
We always talk about the path, echo Charles.

545
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Yes, sir.

546
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
In fact, we all close many of the podcasts we talk about, hey, how do we stay on the path?

547
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Yes, sir.

548
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And of course, people sometimes ask, well, what is that?

549
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
What is the path?

550
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Here you go.

551
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
That's what this section is for.

552
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And some of those direct quotes talking about the path.

553
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
But the path is your life, and it continues on the path is your life, and so the path is different for everyone.

554
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000
It's your goals, your dreams, what you want to become, the path is yours.

555
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
But at the same time, much of the path is the same for everyone.

556
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:59.000
The path is how you strive to become an eminently qualified human.

557
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
And then it gets into, how do I find the path?

558
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
What does that look like?

559
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Because I'm sitting here saying, now the path is different for everyone.

560
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Finding the path is in this hard as you think.

561
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Some of it is clearly defined in the code.

562
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
The rest of the path comes from simple questions you can ask yourself, what do you care about?

563
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Who do you want to be?

564
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
What matters most to you?

565
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
What are the most important things in your life?

566
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Who are the most important people in your life?

567
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
And what do they need from you?

568
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Answer those questions, then write down what you need to do to achieve them.

569
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Those things that you need to do that you are supposed to do that you know you must do.

570
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Those things are the path.

571
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
The path is in your head waiting for you to follow it.

572
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Once again, it's funny that when we talk about the path, even though people like what's the path everyone kind of knows what it is.

573
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Like, like, you know many people have come up to me like, well, been on the path for like two years now.

574
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
We never define the path, but they know what the path is.

575
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
I've been on the path for, I've been on the path.

576
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
You know, when I used to meet people who come up to me and they'd say, I managed really going to meet you.

577
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Like, how long you've been on the path for?

578
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And this is something that had never been defined.

579
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Never said the path was this, this, this and this, but they knew what the path was.

580
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Yeah, it's in their head.

581
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
They know.

582
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
You were talking about, you said, if you don't do this, it's a mortal sin.

583
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
He's the mortal sin.

584
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
You said earlier, the path is what the world needs you to be.

585
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
That's the mortal sin by not being on the path is that you are failing the world.

586
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
The world needs you to be this.

587
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
That's the mortal sin of not doing whatever this thing is you need to do.

588
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Whatever that path is not being on the path is that's what the world needs you to be.

589
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
I think that's legit.

590
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Next section, how do I stay on the path?

591
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Once you see the path, you must begin to walk down it.

592
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
This can be the most difficult part of the journey to break free of the gravitational pull of weakness,

593
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
habit, and fear.

594
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
The gravitational pull of weakness, habit, and fear.

595
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Those are some strong gravitational pulls.

596
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Yes.

597
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
The best way to start is to start.

598
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Don't hesitate, don't wait, don't analyze or plan a research.

599
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Just start now.

600
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Once you begin down the path, you will soon realize it is not an easy path.

601
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.000
The path is fraught with obstacles and distractions, laziness, ego, weakness, and immediate gratification.

602
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
We'll try to pull you off the path every day.

603
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
You must fight them.

604
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
You will even have to fight people who don't want you on the path.

605
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
But you can fight.

606
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And you can win.

607
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
What is it about people that don't want you on the path?

608
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
You know what I'm saying?

609
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Yeah.

610
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
It's that self-reflection thing, where, you know how.

611
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
I don't know time and temperature.

612
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
There's millions of examples, but you know the kind where you see someone like you just get a couple thousand.

613
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
You know what you see, so, and like working hard.

614
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Oh, yeah.

615
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
It's like man, you kind of know in the back of your head.

616
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Straight up consciously though, like, man, I should be working harder.

617
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
And that kind of, like, demonstrates it for it.

618
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
It's like a reminder of how hard you could be working, but you're not.

619
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I don't like that feeling.

620
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So, hey, if you just stopped working hard, I wouldn't have to like do anything hard

621
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
and I could actually feel better.

622
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
You know, it's like that kind of situation.

623
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I think this happened in Australia at the master.

624
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
We would do our workouts.

625
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
So, before the master, we're like running driver hersels of the, of the, of the,

626
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
PT's, the early morning PT's.

627
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
And so, we'd be out there for, for third in the morning.

628
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And people would walk by and it was interesting.

629
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
It's interesting.

630
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Because it'd be, you know, it's time, you know, some people come and home from the pubs, right?

631
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
It's four o'clock in the morning, right?

632
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
We're seeing people.

633
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
They got their, they got their drink on.

634
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
And so, but it's interesting how some people would say,

635
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
some people are just, would just be negative, you know?

636
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Well, you don't want to, what are you doing?

637
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
You know, they're, and, and what, you can just feel it coming out of their system.

638
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
They just feel guilty and horrible.

639
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Yeah, it's, it's a lot less about you than it's about them.

640
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Those gravitational forces of weakness and fear,

641
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
man, they like company.

642
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
They like other people.

643
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
So, I'm gonna say, and they see you break it free.

644
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Those gravitational forces.

645
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
They don't like that.

646
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And it's better for them if you stay down there with them.

647
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Because that forces them to start to reconcile their own weakness and their own fear

648
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
and their own gravitational pulls it, putting them in their own direction.

649
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And not to your fight against them seeing you breaking free from that.

650
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
And that's gonna be a problem for them.

651
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Yes, wish one of those people are like close to you, which, you know, I guess, you know, I see it, I understand.

652
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
But, man, it's kind of even worse when they're close to you.

653
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
For them, you seem to be saying, like, what if you're, what if you're drinking

654
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
buddy is now like doing something else and he's not drinking it.

655
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
He's not drinking it.

656
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Come on, man.

657
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Yeah.

658
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Just coming up a beer with me.

659
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Come on.

660
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Yeah.

661
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
What's wrong with you?

662
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Yeah.

663
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.000
That's wrong.

664
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Yeah.

665
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Yeah.

666
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
But what happened?

667
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Let's grab some fun.

668
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Come on.

669
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Yeah.

670
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Forget about this path stuff.

671
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
He's talking about it.

672
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
What are you doing?

673
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Improving yourself.

674
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah.

675
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
That used to really, I'm sure you saw this in the Marine Corps,

676
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
but, well, maybe you did.

677
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And the SEAL team is, you'd see someone trying to step up and you see other people trying

678
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
to hack away at all if you can nasty.

679
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Yeah.

680
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Worst thing ever.

681
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Is it, you know how like when you're close to someone, you kind of have this kind of picture

682
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
of them, you know, like this, like this, like this, just idea of who they are, right?

683
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
And then, so when they, and then you kind of, in a way you kind of get used to it

684
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
or get comfortable with it, like in the relationship and all that.

685
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
So when they change, you kind of throw off the relationship a little bit.

686
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Like it's like, oh, my whole image of you is like changing now, I'm uncomfortable.

687
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
It feels like that, two sometimes.

688
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You know, like, you know, if you just, especially if they make a quick, like, drastic change.

689
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Yeah.

690
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Yeah.

691
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
The idea like, man, I think you're going to be doing more assistance.

692
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Yeah.

693
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Because it makes it feel uncomfortable in that way as well.

694
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
You know, like, because it's like that, almost like a, like, a social comfort zone.

695
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
You know, where it's like they're different.

696
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
It's almost like, oh, the friend that I know, even though you're better technically,

697
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
the friend that I've come to know and love your distance is different.

698
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Yeah, yeah, it's not there anymore, you know.

699
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000
The, the, when Seth Stone was had this idea and his head that he wanted to go to Princeton,

700
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
wanted to go undergrad at Princeton.

701
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And so he started, you know, he's an active duty on the SEAL teams and there's no program that sends you to Princeton.

702
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
And he says to me, he's like, hey, don't think about trying to go to Princeton.

703
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Like, and I guess there was some program that might have been in the process of being created or whatever,

704
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
but it wasn't a real thing yet.

705
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
And I said, I said, bro, that's, that's, that'll be awesome, man.

706
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
That'll be awesome.

707
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I mean, you'll be a degree from freakin' Princeton, right?

708
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
And he comes back to me a few days later and we weren't in task here at Bruser at this time.

709
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
And he says, yeah, I'm not sure if I should really go.

710
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
And I said, why not, man?

711
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
He's like, well, some of the other officers I've talked to said that it's not a good idea.

712
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
And it could mess up my timing and my career and stuff.

713
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
And I said, bro, that is just absolute jealousy.

714
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
And from Princeton, I said, that's a good idea.

715
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
And the thing is, Seth had such a big heart.

716
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
And he was so loyal, like even when he asked guys, he kind of took it at face value.

717
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
They're looking out for me.

718
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
And I said, bro, these guys are jealous.

719
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
You should absolutely apply.

720
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Any did, any went?

721
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
And yeah, obviously.

722
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
That's the, that's the thing though, is the beauty about being off the path.

723
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
And you get on the path.

724
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
There's a lot of people on the path.

725
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
So whatever you're losing, whatever those friends are, those friends,

726
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
you forget them quickly.

727
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Because there's a lot of people on the path that are going to replace them immediately.

728
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Getting on the path, fear, whatever you're breaking free from.

729
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
All those people going to try to pull you down.

730
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Those people fade almost immediately when you get on the path.

731
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Because the satisfaction of being on the path with other people that are on the path.

732
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Dude, that is way more powerful gravitational force than the fear of letting your friends down.

733
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Is it just coming out with me?

734
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Comforting video games or whatever people do today.

735
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I don't know if that's what I'm talking about.

736
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
I don't know if that's what I'm talking about.

737
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Yeah, and that's not to mention the people that actually come with you.

738
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Even a little bit, you know how I come.

739
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I think Jordan Peterson saying, like, you to find out who your friends are.

740
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
See who is happy with your success or something along those lines.

741
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
And that's kind of what it does too, where you're older and

742
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
He and buddy, some of them will be like, all hating on you.

743
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
He's like, oh, he's too good for us.

744
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Now, you know, mad at whatever, but then every once in a while,

745
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
like you'll get one be like, hey, wait, what are you doing over here?

746
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Let me try that.

747
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Let me come with you, you know, wherever.

748
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
You know, to do you do whatever.

749
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
So then that'll differentiate and that'll separate and identify kind of like,

750
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
who's your quote unquote real friend as well.

751
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Yeah, and if you see your friends becoming successful and you start feeling that little

752
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
twin' shove, you don't, you want to bring them down.

753
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Yeah, you're being that guy, man.

754
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Don't let that happen.

755
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Continue on every moment you are alive as made of choices you get to make.

756
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Little tiny choices that alone mean nothing, but when combined together mean everything.

757
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
You have to make the right choices, the hard choices.

758
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
You have to deny immediate gratification and push back against weakness.

759
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
You must impose unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

760
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
That is how you stay on the path.

761
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:07.000
We must stay on the path if we are to become an eminently qualified human being.

762
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
But what does this Emily Qualifying human look like?

763
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
What do the attributes of this person?

764
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
An enemy qualified human is a person who has achieved mastery in every facet of life.

765
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
This person has reached their full potential in every measurable way.

766
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
This person lives the code.

767
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:31.000
But in order for us to live the code, we need to clearly define its parts so that we can evaluate our progress every day.

768
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
We need an evaluation system to grade ourselves as we attempt to follow the code.

769
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
And it should be hard.

770
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
The bar must be set high.

771
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
It should be near impossible.

772
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
But just in striving, we will become better.

773
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
And we must implement discipline.

774
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
We must aim to implement unmitigated daily discipline in all things.

775
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
It is the only way.

776
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
There are countless aspects of life each with its varying level of importance.

777
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
But what are the most important?

778
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
What aspects of life should be focused?

779
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Where should the pursuit of excellence be concentrated?

780
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
It's easy to say that everyone's life is different.

781
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
And that is impossible to quantify categories that are the most important.

782
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
But that isn't true.

783
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:27.000
There are some things in life which should be universally placed in the forefront of our efforts as human beings.

784
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
To that end, there are the most critical parts of being an eminently qualified human.

785
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
And how they should be measured.

786
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
This is how we set the standard.

787
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
This is the code evaluation.

788
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And so now we get into this evaluation.

789
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And we get into where we tie into, this is where it all stem from this Marine Corps evaluation, which sets the insane and,

790
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
basically unachievable goals.

791
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:58.000
And I would tell you that even someone that got five owes and categories,

792
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.000
you could dig those down a little bit.

793
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
I got five owes and categories.

794
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
I can tell you I had to meet that standard.

795
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Yeah, not happening.

796
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
So the first category is health.

797
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Since our physical bodies are the support mechanisms for our brains, physical fitness, and health are paramount to our existence,

798
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:29.000
to be able to engage in the critical aspects of life, our bodies need to be able to endure the demands we place on it.

799
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
We need to exercise, be well rested, and well nourished, to reach optimal health.

800
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
On top of cardiovascular health, a person must be strong, fast, agile, flexible, and mobile.

801
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
To be each of those things you have to engage in activities that positively impact all of them.

802
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:52.000
What we put into our bodies and how we effectively rest our bodies play an equally important role in ensuring we can perform at the highest level.

803
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000
You can't reach your potential if you aren't healthy.

804
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So this is what you're grading yourself on.

805
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
This is the evaluation.

806
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
This is how you're grading yourself.

807
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
The number one thing that you're grading is health. It starts with physical fitness.

808
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
One point one physical fitness.

809
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Being physically fit allows you to perform daily functions from working to playing with your kids to moving things around the house,

810
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
all while wall avoiding injury.

811
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Having an effective fitness routine when your young sets the foundation for being fit later in life,

812
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
maintaining your physical fitness becomes more critical.

813
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
As you get older, this is a basic daily necessity.

814
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
And then it talks about one point two, sleep and rest.

815
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Brain and body recovery is rooted in sleep.

816
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
A scientific studies on the effects of sleep continue to mount.

817
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:46.000
It's becoming more and more evident that you must consistently get your required amount of sleep in order to cognitively perform on the highest levels.

818
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Sleeping too little or too much have dramatic, negative effects on your body and ability to perform.

819
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Established the amount of sleep you need and prioritized accordingly.

820
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Yeah.

821
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
I've had to point people back to the discipline and go to freedom field manual.

822
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Wouldn't it look like what time you wake you up?

823
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000
What time do you go to bed?

824
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Well, it's wrong with you. You're killing yourself.

825
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
You're so unhealthy.

826
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
No.

827
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Some people need different amounts of sleep.

828
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
And if you need sleep, you need to get sleep.

829
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Yeah.

830
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
And the next part of health is diet and nutrition.

831
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
There's no part of you.

832
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Your diet does not affect the fuel for your body.

833
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Determines how you look, feel and function.

834
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Determines how it looks, feels and functions.

835
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Knowledge and implementation of what constitutes a healthy diet is imperative.

836
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000
And we'll make the difference between maximum performance and substandard performance.

837
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
So there you have it.

838
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
That's right for it.

839
00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
That right there is health.

840
00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
The next thing we go into is called personal development.

841
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Personal development.

842
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Much like our bodies we need to nourish and grow our much like how we need to nourish and grow.

843
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Our bodies, our brains and personal behaviors need the same attention.

844
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Our brains need activities like reading, writing, building, creative pursuits and other actions that promote intellectual health.

845
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:24.000
We also need to train ourselves to improve how we deal with the challenges in our personal world,

846
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:31.000
making the best use of our limited time and money and setting goals all contribute to personal development.

847
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
So this is one of those things we're, you know,

848
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.000
if you don't, if you're not grading and that's the point of this evaluation, if you don't,

849
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
great.

850
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000
If someone doesn't show you, like when I was a young seal and I thought I was doing a good job with tactics,

851
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
and then they show me what it says to be a tactical 5.0, I'm not even close.

852
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000
So how often do we think about from a personal development perspective that we're actually doing an outstanding job?

853
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:07.000
We don't even, most people don't even know what that even remotely looks like.

854
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So then we talk about intellectual fitness.

855
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
While carried in the chasties of the body, the mind is supreme, it is us.

856
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
It needs to be protected nourished and trained.

857
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:25.000
You exercise the brain and make it more capable by reading, writing, studying and learning new things.

858
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
You need to develop in areas you don't always, that don't always fit into your normal routine.

859
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Even if your job or responsibilities don't demand it, cultivate something artistic, like music, writing or singing.

860
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Do things you're not good at and try activities that make you uncomfortable.

861
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000
They promote creativity and intellectual growth.

862
00:55:48.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Remember how just psycho we go whenever you and I talk about the fact, the creative aspect of combat and war and how much the Marine Corps talks about this creative nature.

863
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Yeah.

864
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Creative nature needs to be developed.

865
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Yeah.

866
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:20.000
The idea of intellectual fitness is being a thing that you have to force yourself to do things you're not good at to exercise your own brain.

867
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.000
It's easy to think about that in the physical system.

868
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I want to get better at something I'll do this physical exercise.

869
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
I will run or I will lift weights or whatever I'll stretch.

870
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
I don't have good flexibility.

871
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
I can fix that by stretching.

872
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
The intellectual piece is especially at work.

873
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:43.000
If people are in the grinder and the routine and they just get stuck in this day to day thing of what they're doing is your brain needs you to force it to do things it's not good at to get better.

874
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
And it's not that you become a master pianist or a brilliant musician.

875
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
It's that your brain gets better and smarter and stronger and you can do so many other things better by doing that.

876
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000
The intellectual fitness piece is how your brain grows which it has to everyday.

877
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
I can never remember being told to think about how you're growing your brain everyday.

878
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
I did not have that grown up.

879
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
I know what he told me that.

880
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:13.000
I didn't think about that and it never occurred to me that this is something that I everyday need to think about how I'm doing.

881
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:28.000
It gives you and I would say people are now kind of discovering like they'll tell you hey when you're over 60 you should try and learn an instrument or try and learn a new language because it makes your brain is like your body needs work.

882
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:36.000
He's exercise and not to mention just how look the mind is the ultimate weapon.

883
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000
I was just telling my son that the other day you know because he all he wants to do is what jack steal.

884
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Right train like that's it.

885
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
So hey man that's awesome.

886
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I get it but you better sharpen that other's down on the tool you got to because that's the ultimate weapon.

887
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Yeah.

888
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
And you can feel it.

889
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
I can't.

890
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Like I can feel it when I'm on point when I'm doing a bunch of work with a bunch of clients where I'm digging deep with you know writing something or going through.

891
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.000
You know when I'm preparing for a podcast I can feel the foundation getting stronger.

892
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:32.000
You know I feel my own mental foundation getting stronger because I have better understanding of connecting the dots and pulling the thread and figuring out where things connect.

893
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000
And that's just powerful.

894
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
You get a lot of exercise so to speak.

895
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
I have an intern of your brain just by talking to so many people.

896
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Oh, I mean you know like you ever I mean you've never been in a situation where you didn't talk to anyone for like a week.

897
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Not anyone at all but like you've been pretty whether be standing in your house or whatever.

898
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Maybe just me but I don't let's say I don't have many social interactions.

899
00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000
We'll say for like a little extended period of time.

900
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
When you jump back into social situations you feel kind of awkward you know.

901
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Same thing is if like you stopped lifting for a while then you try to get underneath that weight again and you're like, oh this is a little heavier than I remember it being you know.

902
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Yeah you know when Jordan Peterson kind of hit the scene.

903
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:28.000
And people with people who talk to me about Jordan and they take man he gives these incredible answers right.

904
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:35.000
And and I'd be like yeah definitely and then I'd take go watch his lecture from 1987 when he's a professor at Harvard.

905
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:41.000
He's given that answer that you know someone asks him, whoa, whatever whatever they're going to ask him.

906
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:56.000
He's he's actually given that answer and thought through it at a deep level that he's going to give you be able to give that answer and it's going to sound amazing because he's prepared that answer at that moment for 30 years.

907
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
So but here's the thing.

908
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:09.000
That having that base is what allows you to riff when the time comes it allows you to make that little adjustment to that individual person.

909
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.000
So the more training you get the more exercise you get the better you're going to be.

910
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
You know you also see it with like like politicians.

911
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If you see a politician and someone catches them with the way they don't really haven't fought through that answer before depending on their intellectual fitness.

912
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Sometimes they can figure out a way around it but sometimes they're just looking dumb. You know what I'm saying? Because they're just they just don't know how to do it.

913
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And you can see a good a good politician.

914
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
They get asked something that catches them off guard and they're able to handle it in a good positive way.

915
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
You know like you like oh.

916
01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
You know what that's that's you know when you make that you have their answer they have a way of doing it they have a way of contemplating what's going on at real time because they're used to doing it.

917
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:20.000
And you know you know Dave this is kind of our life not political side but working with companies and going in and having people ask us questions and you know we're going to score 94% I've heard that question or very close similar question that and then 6% it's like oh this person has a unique problem.

918
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That's just their problem.

919
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:41.000
How do we apply our leadership principles to that problem that they're having and the more the better the stronger your foundation is the easier it is to say oh yeah here's what you're experiencing I get it I understand what you're trying to say and here's a way to approach that.

920
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Intellectual fitness.

921
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And there's no more valuable resource in life than time and it's limited in quantity no one knows how much time they have so you have to maximize all of it.

922
01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:25.000
And yet people waste their most precious resource every day how well you manage your time determines how productive you are. Next one financial management like time money is precious resource. So avoid wasting money on anything that is a productive track what you spent money on what you saved and what you invested if you're disciplined with your money you'll have more of it to spend on things you want and things you need.

923
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
This is the criticism that says yeah and it seems like you're awfully focused on money here.

924
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Right is there criticism that's going to come my way that's going to be leveled at me.

925
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
That you should be disciplined with your money.

926
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Yeah.

927
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I think the reason that this leaves a mark where something that I think people can do pay attention to is because when I people that I've known throughout my entire life.

928
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:06.000
When you look at what problems they have like what is causing their angst what is causing the problems in their life.

929
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:14.000
There's a large percentage of those problems that are financial problems for sure.

930
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And if you don't think about it, you know if you're going to talk to if you're going to have a code and your 18 years old look you're not going to start thinking to many questions say that you're not.

931
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Many people don't start thinking about money when they're 18 they don't start thinking about their finance when you know what their finance is when you're 20 years old.

932
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000
So I have enough money for Saturday night cool made it.

933
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:46.000
You know and then that goes through the weekend and then they try and scrape together a little bit more money and then the same question do I have enough money for Saturday night.

934
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Cool made it and the only time they adjust is if they didn't have enough money for Saturday night and then they go, got to need to work some more hours.

935
01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Say work a little bit more hours so they have enough money for Saturday night not the way to go through life.

936
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:16.000
And most people that get on the path they're not jumping on the path so they can end up with a Ferrari like that's not the path that they're on this idea of financial management and recognizing that this is a practice resource that everybody needs to fulfill whatever is you want.

937
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:29.000
If you want to take music lessons you want to put your kids through piano that that's going to cost a little bit of money and this idea of financial management is really the recognition that whether you want to admit it or not or whether you like it or not.

938
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.000
This is a resource that is hard to come by it's hard to come by and it's going to influence your life.

939
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That doesn't say your goal should be to be rich that's not what this is and that's not even really the point but this is a resource that is going to impact your life for your entire life for you for the people around you.

940
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:56.000
And what it means is that you need to acknowledge that you need to make decisions that impact that so you can have as much of that resources possible to do the most good without resource when it matters.

941
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And there are very few things in the world that you can do where money does not influence it for better for worse and you just when you were talking about what do people think about when they're 20 you're talking to every 20 year old that's out there right now.

942
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I mean we can all relate to that idea of where am I thinking how far down the order of my thinking that is not a path that is not the way to go through life.

943
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:34.000
This is a resource that people need to live the life they want doesn't mean you have to be rich doesn't mean you have to drive fast cars and have a nice house it means you have to have this resource to help the people around you do the things that they need and if you don't think about that you're not going to have it when you need it.

944
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yeah if you don't put the goal in place you're going to always be looking to Saturday night or whatever that you know equivalent is in your life which is do I have enough money to pay the rent do you know when you're do I have enough money to feed the kids do I have enough money for the car payment whenever those things are.

945
01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah you don't have to end up there no you don't and if there's a massive disruption like what we're going through right now if you're on the path you can deal with that better.

946
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You can respond to that better you can take care of your family better.

947
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
This is about recognizing that this resource impact your life and it will forever.

948
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Yeah I guess anybody that would say you will money is not important.

949
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:31.000
It's tough to convince me of that because if even if you're saying hey you know what I'm going to live in a van down by the river.

950
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.000
You need you to gas for the van and that means you're going to have to do something to get money for gas for the van you know that's the way it is.

951
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:49.000
You can even and part of financial management is setting your expenditures in a point where you can handle it you know like.

952
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
I forget whatever podcast we talked about financial management I'm like oh yeah here's what you do.

953
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Spend less than you make. Start with that spend less than you make cool that's going to put you in a great place in life. You know you don't need the brand new car off a lot.

954
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
You don't need that echo Charles.

955
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I understand.

956
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Check.

957
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Well the living in the van thing too which I'm not saying no one thinks about this or whatever but like you need my okay so you.

958
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Even your safety right you know like medical or whatever like if you break your leg or get some infection or something living in the van.

959
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Yeah bro you can be in bed shape compared to you know if you're kind of on the path there and you're like okay medical no problem I got insurance or I can pay for it or whatever you know how to sort yourself out in that way but yeah if you're like oh money doesn't mean anything so I make zero money I'm going to live off the land or whatever yeah but.

960
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Unless you're like yeah whatever. If you're trained in medical stuff you can be jammed up you get an infection or something like this.

961
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Yeah what about also what about when you can't take care of your family.

962
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Because that's a whole other ball game.

963
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You know in all of a sudden you go hey you know what if I'm if I'm sick or whatever I'll just suck it up and but what if your kids get sick.

964
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Like then what are we going to do.

965
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
That's why financial management is important and if you're not paying attention to it if you don't have a clearly defined goal if you don't have an underlying.

966
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You're going to line commanders intent of how you're going to live financially you're going to be caught in a hamster wheel that never ends of chasing.

967
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Chasing that dime you know.

968
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
The people that pay more here's what here's what here's the weird dichotomy.

969
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000
If I'm a person that doesn't doesn't care about money and I'm like you know money's not important to me I'm going to be chasing that dollar for the rest of my life.

970
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Versus someone that says you know what money is important I'm going to figure out how to take it and keep it and grow it.

971
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That person will end up not having concerned about money not having any concerns about money.

972
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Whereas the person that doesn't care about money doesn't think it's a big deal and doesn't want to worry about it they're going to be worrying about it forever.

973
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So there you go.

974
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It's kind of like that one where people people someone someone has to say I don't really want to fight so why should I learn G. Jitsu and I said if you don't want to fight you are the number one person that you're learning G. Jitsu so if you're out there thinking I don't really care about money you're the number one person that should care about money.

975
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Yeah you can set yourself up for freedom or you can be a slave.

976
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Next personal goals. You have to know your objectives you have to know what your objectives are to put meaning around the things you are doing set physical goals like running a 5k or deadlifting 8000 pounds.

977
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Set intellectual goals like learning a language or pursuing a degree set goals for diet sleep time money management.

978
01:09:47.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Evaluate every day if your goals need to change and if you move closer to them track major milestones for school work competitions setting and achieving goals is a critical human pursuit make your goals hard to achieve when you achieve them they will have more meaning.

979
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Pretty straightforward.

980
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.96
Next up this is the next section that you are grading yourself in section three professional development being good at your job allows you

981
01:10:16.96 --> 01:10:27.96
to provide financially for you and your family set an example for your children and achieve long-term objectives. Your professional success is key to your personal success performance.

982
01:10:27.96 --> 01:10:36.96
Three point one performance being secure in your position at work provides stability minimize the risk of losing your job and the means to support yourself your family by performing well.

983
01:10:36.96 --> 01:10:39.96
Get better at your job each day and seek take.

984
01:10:39.96 --> 01:10:47.96
Seek and take feedback from others when there is an opportunity find ways to actively support others and improve your team. Okay, so now we'll go down the same path.

985
01:10:47.96 --> 01:10:51.96
The path of hey man, I'm welcome through life just to work.

986
01:10:51.96 --> 01:10:54.96
That's not my thing. I'm not going to focus on work. Okay.

987
01:10:54.96 --> 01:11:07.96
So that's what you're going to do. You're not going to focus on work. So for the rest of your 40 years of working as a human from 20 to 60 you're not going to focus on that thing.

988
01:11:07.96 --> 01:11:16.96
Guess what you're not going to progress. You're always going to be at the bottom of the chain of command. You're going to have little to no control over your fate.

989
01:11:16.96 --> 01:11:21.96
And I was just talking about that with a client right before we came here.

990
01:11:21.96 --> 01:11:26.96
The in the Navy, I couldn't give anyone a pay raise. I mean, I could get them promoted. It takes two or three years. Whatever.

991
01:11:26.96 --> 01:11:33.96
I can't give someone a pay raise. The way you pay people is you give them control over their destiny. So when you work hard.

992
01:11:33.96 --> 01:11:39.96
You end up with control over your destiny. I'll tell you what, man. I wasn't the military for 20 years.

993
01:11:39.96 --> 01:11:45.96
I would say 15 of those years.

994
01:11:45.96 --> 01:11:51.96
I had almost complete unmedicated control over my own destiny.

995
01:11:51.96 --> 01:11:59.96
As crazy as that sounds. Like as crazy as that sounds 15 years. I'm talking day by the, you know, maybe one, maybe one hour of a day.

996
01:11:59.96 --> 01:12:05.96
You know, last week I had a guy that was like, you need to get this done. I was like, hey, Roger that. I didn't have control over my own destiny.

997
01:12:05.96 --> 01:12:14.96
The other 90% of the time I was I had things set up in a way that I can control my own destiny.

998
01:12:14.96 --> 01:12:32.96
When I remember, I was one of the few kids growing up in my circle of friends at school that wanted to join the military. Most people didn't. And the common thing was, I'm, I don't want people to tell me what to do. You know, I don't want to be, you know, getting yelled at by people or, you know, outrank me and whatever that idea was of what the military was like.

999
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:39.96
And I didn't really know what the military was like. I was just kind of enamored by it and I actually sort of thought there would be some yelling involved. And I've told what to do.

1000
01:12:39.96 --> 01:12:48.96
There aren't a lot of jobs in the world where you don't work for somebody. And what you described is even in the military, which people think is like the most rigid hierarchy.

1001
01:12:48.96 --> 01:12:57.96
Bro, the amount of autonomy that I had when I was the squadron commander of the world's only F-35 squadron in the world.

1002
01:12:57.96 --> 01:13:05.96
I could do almost anything. I could do almost anything. Yes, and I've a boss of course. And I've met you ahead of me. Of course.

1003
01:13:05.96 --> 01:13:18.96
Just like in almost every other job in the world, I answered to somebody. But the, the tool that gave me all that autonomy was years and years and years of years of actually doing my job well.

1004
01:13:18.96 --> 01:13:29.96
And the freedom that being good at your work gives you down the road. You could be in the military at any wreck. If you're really good at your job, you don't get, you get freedom, you get autonomy. You get a little control over your life.

1005
01:13:29.96 --> 01:13:38.96
And everybody wants that. When we get asked, we get us all the time. People talk about problems that have it work. And the two simplest ways to get through what the problems are.

1006
01:13:38.96 --> 01:13:42.96
One is typically connected to relationships. How does your relationship with this person, whatever problem you're having?

1007
01:13:42.96 --> 01:13:49.96
And the other one is how good are you at your job? Because most people that are really good at their job don't have a lot of problems at work.

1008
01:13:49.96 --> 01:13:54.96
They just don't. And it's the ones that have, I have friction with my boss or my leadership or, and they talk about all these problems.

1009
01:13:54.96 --> 01:13:59.96
Oftentimes, the thing they can do to get, make, make, make most of those problems go away is just do a better job.

1010
01:13:59.96 --> 01:14:02.96
Because if you're in a better job, your boss is going to stop bugging you.

1011
01:14:02.96 --> 01:14:05.96
Your peers are going to stop bugging you. You're supporting you to stop giving you a hard time.

1012
01:14:05.96 --> 01:14:11.96
And so this idea of performance, that's the best thing you could do, whether you're working for the man or for the sergeant.

1013
01:14:11.96 --> 01:14:18.96
That gives you the most amount of freedom and self control over your life is just be good at work.

1014
01:14:18.96 --> 01:14:23.96
When I was writing leadership strategy in tactics, that was a very in depth review of my life and my career.

1015
01:14:23.96 --> 01:14:28.96
And a lot of ways. And that's one of the things that's I dug down and said,

1016
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:35.96
Why was I, what did I do to build trust? What did I do to get autonomy? What did I do to get ownership?

1017
01:14:35.96 --> 01:14:40.96
What did I do to get all those things? And it was, you know, I'm sitting there squeezing my brain one night.

1018
01:14:40.96 --> 01:14:45.96
I was like, I didn't actually know exactly what I did. I worked for the hard and did a good job.

1019
01:14:45.96 --> 01:14:51.96
And when you work really hard to do a good job, people start, and actually working really hard is just what I had to do to do a good job.

1020
01:14:51.96 --> 01:14:55.96
If you can just do a good job, you don't even have to work hard.

1021
01:14:55.96 --> 01:15:00.96
I had to work a little harder, but that idea of performance.

1022
01:15:00.96 --> 01:15:06.96
And again, if there's someone that's sitting here listening going, well, you know, I don't like what I do.

1023
01:15:06.96 --> 01:15:08.96
Cool. Do awesome.

1024
01:15:08.96 --> 01:15:09.96
Awesome.

1025
01:15:09.96 --> 01:15:15.96
And other opportunities will open up, including saying, Hey boss, I really appreciate it working here.

1026
01:15:15.96 --> 01:15:19.96
I think I'm going to move on to a different career. Can I get a letter of recommendation?

1027
01:15:19.96 --> 01:15:20.96
Absolutely.

1028
01:15:20.96 --> 01:15:29.96
Don't worry. Thank you. Boom. So the other view point would say, if you're not into it, you don't want to invest a bunch of time into it.

1029
01:15:29.96 --> 01:15:32.96
Okay. What are you going to do then? What are you going to do?

1030
01:15:32.96 --> 01:15:36.96
Yeah. This is your job. This is your vocation. Go and do it. Do it well.

1031
01:15:36.96 --> 01:15:41.96
And you know what? Sometimes, sometimes it actually involves just doing what you're told.

1032
01:15:41.96 --> 01:15:45.96
Sometimes when you're the new guy, you're brand new. And even if it doesn't quite make sense,

1033
01:15:45.96 --> 01:15:49.96
maybe you don't want to do it. I don't want to, like, sometimes just do what you're told in the beginning.

1034
01:15:49.96 --> 01:15:52.96
Build a little credibility. Don't push back and everything.

1035
01:15:52.96 --> 01:15:57.96
And if that just means just following orders at the beginning, which is what all brand new people do.

1036
01:15:57.96 --> 01:15:58.96
They just kind of following orders.

1037
01:15:58.96 --> 01:15:59.96
Real pay do.

1038
01:15:59.96 --> 01:16:02.96
You start to figure things out a little bit.

1039
01:16:02.96 --> 01:16:05.96
Understand what your boss is intent was and really not just giving orders.

1040
01:16:05.96 --> 01:16:08.96
He's actually had a larger purpose, but you fall through that get some credibility.

1041
01:16:08.96 --> 01:16:14.96
You get a more autonomy. And yet, does that mean sometimes you're just going to get on board and just do whatever you're asked to do to make things happen?

1042
01:16:14.96 --> 01:16:15.96
Yes. It does.

1043
01:16:15.96 --> 01:16:19.96
But that doesn't last forever. That news it doesn't even last a very long time.

1044
01:16:19.96 --> 01:16:26.96
It actually is a really short period of time. And the best way to get to that is just just be the guy that's outperforming everybody else.

1045
01:16:26.96 --> 01:16:32.96
Keep your mouth shut and do good work. And very quickly, very quickly, you find yourself with the freedom that autonomy.

1046
01:16:32.96 --> 01:16:34.96
And you get to be in charge sometimes.

1047
01:16:34.96 --> 01:16:36.96
You get to make your own decisions with other folks.

1048
01:16:36.96 --> 01:16:41.96
So this idea of being good at your job, it affects every part of your life.

1049
01:16:41.96 --> 01:16:42.96
Yeah.

1050
01:16:42.96 --> 01:16:50.96
And once again, if you've got the miserable job that you hate, the best thing you can do is be awesome at it.

1051
01:16:50.96 --> 01:17:03.96
Invest, do awesome at it because you'll get promoted out of that job or you'll get openings to another thing in the world that will allow you to do something that you like, which speaking of which next section.

1052
01:17:03.96 --> 01:17:13.96
Advancement of qualifications, figure out what is required to promote or advance and take deliberate steps to do so determine what certifications or qualifications are required to outperform your competition.

1053
01:17:13.96 --> 01:17:14.96
Then earn them.

1054
01:17:14.96 --> 01:17:20.96
Find a meaning in your job. If your job doesn't have meaning, designing an extra strategy to move to one that does.

1055
01:17:20.96 --> 01:17:25.96
A lot of our time will be spent at work, make it matter.

1056
01:17:25.96 --> 01:17:30.96
And hey, this idea of finding out what it takes to promote.

1057
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:37.96
There were some guys in the teams that would go through that little book and go, well, I could just call it, I'll get this call.

1058
01:17:37.96 --> 01:17:39.96
Okay, I'm ready for, that's not what I'm talking about.

1059
01:17:39.96 --> 01:17:40.96
No, no, no, no.

1060
01:17:40.96 --> 01:17:43.96
And I want to talk about, but that is part of performance.

1061
01:17:43.96 --> 01:17:46.96
So do it with the right context.

1062
01:17:46.96 --> 01:17:47.96
Yeah.

1063
01:17:47.96 --> 01:17:55.96
No, I mean, that's, yeah, I think you've talked about this a bunch and I think in the Navy and the Marine Corps, there's a saying, I think it's the same phrase that we call them ticket punchers.

1064
01:17:55.96 --> 01:18:00.96
I think it's the same. It might be like, you know, check in the block or whatever. There's some link, link it out there.

1065
01:18:00.96 --> 01:18:03.96
That is not what this is. This isn't on my ticket puncher.

1066
01:18:03.96 --> 01:18:06.96
But there is a little bit like, hey, do I want some control?

1067
01:18:06.96 --> 01:18:08.96
What do I need to do to get a little bit around here? Well, you do this for a while.

1068
01:18:08.96 --> 01:18:16.96
And then there's a certification that you can be kind of a master craftsman in your trade or you get to get a certification where you get to be an instructor in this capability.

1069
01:18:16.96 --> 01:18:19.96
Yeah, I'd like to know what that is. You've learned about it. You get better at it.

1070
01:18:19.96 --> 01:18:21.96
Those are two very different things.

1071
01:18:21.96 --> 01:18:25.96
And you're doing it to make yourself better and make your team around you better and make your world better.

1072
01:18:25.96 --> 01:18:32.96
It's a lot different than I'm going to, you know, trick the system and then we're just getting my ticket punchers succeed until they don't.

1073
01:18:32.96 --> 01:18:34.96
And when they don't, it's usually pretty bad.

1074
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:39.96
When you get kind of high-lighting revealed, it's a ticket puncher. Things don't usually end well for those people.

1075
01:18:39.96 --> 01:18:40.96
Yeah.

1076
01:18:40.96 --> 01:18:49.96
Yeah, it's interesting to call to me that just kind of showed up on these last two is if you don't want to care about money, you should care about money.

1077
01:18:49.96 --> 01:18:52.96
If you don't want to care about your job, you should care about your job.

1078
01:18:52.96 --> 01:18:54.96
The exit comes from discipline.

1079
01:18:54.96 --> 01:18:55.96
Yeah.

1080
01:18:55.96 --> 01:18:57.96
The freedom comes from discipline.

1081
01:18:57.96 --> 01:18:58.96
Period.

1082
01:18:58.96 --> 01:19:01.96
Next section, 4.0 character and leadership.

1083
01:19:01.96 --> 01:19:05.96
Who we are as a person is perhaps the most defining quality in our life.

1084
01:19:05.96 --> 01:19:09.96
Our character impacts those around us and the world we live in.

1085
01:19:09.96 --> 01:19:12.96
And we are incomplete control of it.

1086
01:19:12.96 --> 01:19:18.96
Learning humility, managing our egos and leading and mentoring people in our world are ways we can do.

1087
01:19:18.96 --> 01:19:21.96
We can't our ways we can choose to develop our character.

1088
01:19:21.96 --> 01:19:25.96
Remember, you don't need to be in charge of anyone or anything to lead.

1089
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:30.96
Everyone has the ability and the obligation to lead.

1090
01:19:30.96 --> 01:19:32.96
4.1 humility.

1091
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:34.96
This is the most important quality in a leader.

1092
01:19:34.96 --> 01:19:36.96
Egos, the biggest killer in combat business in life.

1093
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:40.96
Be honest in yourself assessment of your own ego and control it.

1094
01:19:40.96 --> 01:19:43.96
If your ego gets out of control, you will lose.

1095
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:47.96
Watch out for your ego.

1096
01:19:47.96 --> 01:19:51.96
Emotional control.

1097
01:19:51.96 --> 01:19:54.96
Stifle your emotions.

1098
01:19:54.96 --> 01:19:56.96
Emotion, everyone is emotional.

1099
01:19:56.96 --> 01:20:00.96
But we, but not everyone can control their emotions.

1100
01:20:00.96 --> 01:20:02.96
We are not effective when we are emotional.

1101
01:20:02.96 --> 01:20:09.96
We don't have productive conversations, send good emails or make smart decisions when we lose control of our emotions.

1102
01:20:09.96 --> 01:20:16.96
Know your red flags and learn to identify when emotions start to take over children's struggle controlling their emotions.

1103
01:20:16.96 --> 01:20:19.96
Emily qualified humans do not.

1104
01:20:23.96 --> 01:20:26.96
Yeah, that's who gets upset.

1105
01:20:26.96 --> 01:20:28.96
That's who gets angry.

1106
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:30.96
Kids, little children.

1107
01:20:30.96 --> 01:20:31.96
Kids.

1108
01:20:31.96 --> 01:20:34.96
So if you're not a little child, get control of your emotions.

1109
01:20:34.96 --> 01:20:38.96
How many people echoed Charles have pushed back on spifle your emotion?

1110
01:20:38.96 --> 01:20:39.96
Right?

1111
01:20:39.96 --> 01:20:40.96
I've heard it all.

1112
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:42.96
I've heard it.

1113
01:20:42.96 --> 01:20:45.96
If you do that, that's what drives mental health.

1114
01:20:45.96 --> 01:20:48.96
No, look, I'm not saying don't have any emotions.

1115
01:20:48.96 --> 01:20:49.96
Control, no.

1116
01:20:49.96 --> 01:20:50.96
Yeah.

1117
01:20:50.96 --> 01:20:53.96
How about you act like an adult?

1118
01:20:53.96 --> 01:21:00.96
Yeah, there's, because well, when we did analyze that or whatever, if you call it an analysis,

1119
01:21:00.96 --> 01:21:04.96
it's not that you're like bottling them up.

1120
01:21:04.96 --> 01:21:09.96
You're dealing with them in a specific processing or general way.

1121
01:21:09.96 --> 01:21:13.96
Yeah, so you, you know, there's a difference between how you feel and how you behave.

1122
01:21:13.96 --> 01:21:16.96
So if you just relate like however I feel, I'm going to behave.

1123
01:21:16.96 --> 01:21:20.96
That's like an emotional behavior, emotional decision, emotional whatever.

1124
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:25.96
But if you run it through like a little filter, whatever that filter is,

1125
01:21:25.96 --> 01:21:32.96
and don't behave emotionally, it'll help develop your capability to deal with it.

1126
01:21:32.96 --> 01:21:34.96
But to control your emotion.

1127
01:21:34.96 --> 01:21:35.96
Yeah.

1128
01:21:35.96 --> 01:21:36.96
And it's good character.

1129
01:21:36.96 --> 01:21:39.96
You know, that's, that's the section is character, right?

1130
01:21:39.96 --> 01:21:41.96
It's character and leadership.

1131
01:21:41.96 --> 01:21:42.96
Be humble.

1132
01:21:42.96 --> 01:21:44.96
Keep control of your emotions.

1133
01:21:44.96 --> 01:21:49.96
And then the other part of character is mentoring and charity.

1134
01:21:49.96 --> 01:21:54.96
So part of your character is to the book you're helping others, having outlets to provide support

1135
01:21:54.96 --> 01:21:57.96
to those that need it in a way that is productive for them.

1136
01:21:57.96 --> 01:22:01.96
Set your best example, mentor someone, help set goals for friends and family members.

1137
01:22:01.96 --> 01:22:04.96
Take care of other people.

1138
01:22:04.96 --> 01:22:10.96
I mean, the thing that's so important about what you said at the beginning is that this kind of defines who we are.

1139
01:22:10.96 --> 01:22:12.96
But you're 100% control over this.

1140
01:22:12.96 --> 01:22:14.96
You're in control over all of this.

1141
01:22:14.96 --> 01:22:18.96
It doesn't say don't have emotions.

1142
01:22:18.96 --> 01:22:21.96
But you should never let your emotions control you.

1143
01:22:21.96 --> 01:22:24.96
You should be in control of how you react to your emotions.

1144
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:28.96
And the difference is, and we get this all the time is, hey, you had this issue at work,

1145
01:22:28.96 --> 01:22:32.96
and I tried to work it out with this person, and I lost my temper.

1146
01:22:32.96 --> 01:22:34.96
My headnut conversation go, how'd that work out?

1147
01:22:34.96 --> 01:22:35.96
The problem gets solved?

1148
01:22:35.96 --> 01:22:37.96
No, it didn't.

1149
01:22:37.96 --> 01:22:41.96
Because I could not, I can't tell them don't feel angry.

1150
01:22:41.96 --> 01:22:43.96
I can't say that don't feel angry.

1151
01:22:43.96 --> 01:22:47.96
But as you find yourself feeling angry, you can actually control how you respond to that anger.

1152
01:22:47.96 --> 01:22:51.96
And it could be you just deal with it, put in this place, and continue the conversation.

1153
01:22:51.96 --> 01:22:53.96
It could be that you find a different time to have the conversation.

1154
01:22:53.96 --> 01:22:55.96
But the anger is not in charge of you.

1155
01:22:55.96 --> 01:22:56.96
You are in control of this.

1156
01:22:56.96 --> 01:23:00.96
I have yet to had an interaction with someone with a loss of their temper,

1157
01:23:00.96 --> 01:23:05.96
loss control of their emotions, loss control of how they were feeling, and the outcome was good.

1158
01:23:05.96 --> 01:23:06.96
Yeah.

1159
01:23:06.96 --> 01:23:19.96
I'm thinking about how in my life, like, at some point realizing that this was not a good thing.

1160
01:23:19.96 --> 01:23:23.96
And I was definitely watching leaders that I had lose their temper,

1161
01:23:23.96 --> 01:23:28.96
and then just getting to a point where, you know, it's a great, you're not going to face me.

1162
01:23:28.96 --> 01:23:33.96
Like, I'm not going to, you're not going to see that I'm getting frustrated.

1163
01:23:33.96 --> 01:23:34.96
Right?

1164
01:23:34.96 --> 01:23:35.96
It's going to be okay.

1165
01:23:35.96 --> 01:23:37.96
I'm listening.

1166
01:23:37.96 --> 01:23:43.96
And if I do show you some frustration, it's going to be actively trying to show you that I'm frustrating.

1167
01:23:43.96 --> 01:23:46.96
Because I'm trying to send you the message that like, hey, what you're saying right now,

1168
01:23:46.96 --> 01:23:48.96
it doesn't make sense.

1169
01:23:48.96 --> 01:23:49.96
And you don't see that.

1170
01:23:49.96 --> 01:23:52.96
And it's so insensible that I'm actually going to show you

1171
01:23:52.96 --> 01:23:53.96
some frustration.

1172
01:23:53.96 --> 01:23:57.96
So you go, oh, jocquat's getting frustrated, which I don't see very often.

1173
01:23:57.96 --> 01:24:02.96
And now I'm feeling it.

1174
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:06.96
But yeah, it's, uh, I feel like you're stalking of you, not me.

1175
01:24:06.96 --> 01:24:08.96
I feel the same way.

1176
01:24:08.96 --> 01:24:12.96
I actually know, I don't really get, I don't think I don't know if you.

1177
01:24:12.96 --> 01:24:13.96
I don't think you've ever done anything.

1178
01:24:13.96 --> 01:24:14.96
That's frustrated me.

1179
01:24:14.96 --> 01:24:16.96
Actually, can you think of anything?

1180
01:24:16.96 --> 01:24:18.96
Oh, yeah, couple, but what?

1181
01:24:18.96 --> 01:24:22.96
Uh, no, they're all essentially jokes.

1182
01:24:22.96 --> 01:24:23.96
Okay.

1183
01:24:23.96 --> 01:24:25.96
Just like your, yeah, they're just jokes.

1184
01:24:25.96 --> 01:24:28.96
Like, you know, even sometimes you'll, you'll be like, um,

1185
01:24:28.96 --> 01:24:33.96
you'll take extreme ownership, but it'll be real obvious that you're blaming me.

1186
01:24:33.96 --> 01:24:34.96
Yeah.

1187
01:24:34.96 --> 01:24:36.96
You know, like, well, maybe I actually, you know what?

1188
01:24:36.96 --> 01:24:37.96
That's my fault.

1189
01:24:37.96 --> 01:24:39.96
I should be pressing record on that thing.

1190
01:24:39.96 --> 01:24:40.96
You know, it's up to me.

1191
01:24:40.96 --> 01:24:42.96
You know, like that can stuff, but no, no.

1192
01:24:42.96 --> 01:24:43.96
Yeah, those are just fun.

1193
01:24:43.96 --> 01:24:44.96
Yeah, yeah, no.

1194
01:24:44.96 --> 01:24:46.96
Those are just, uh, good times.

1195
01:24:46.96 --> 01:24:48.96
Yeah, because it's going to be hard to frustrate me.

1196
01:24:48.96 --> 01:24:49.96
Yeah.

1197
01:24:49.96 --> 01:24:54.96
It's going to be hard to frustrate me, even, even on the mats of justice.

1198
01:24:54.96 --> 01:24:55.96
Yeah.

1199
01:24:55.96 --> 01:25:01.96
Uh, you know, fatigue is fatigue in a motion kind of, yeah.

1200
01:25:01.96 --> 01:25:02.96
It's a feeling.

1201
01:25:02.96 --> 01:25:03.96
It's a feeling.

1202
01:25:03.96 --> 01:25:04.96
Yeah.

1203
01:25:04.96 --> 01:25:05.96
And you can act, type it, right?

1204
01:25:05.96 --> 01:25:07.96
You can allow people to see that.

1205
01:25:07.96 --> 01:25:08.96
I don't even like to do that.

1206
01:25:08.96 --> 01:25:09.96
Yeah, no.

1207
01:25:09.96 --> 01:25:14.96
Actually, I learned that was a major lesson I learned from you, which was straight up directly.

1208
01:25:14.96 --> 01:25:20.96
Like, don't, I mean, I guess you could oversimplify it and put, like, don't show weakness or whatever,

1209
01:25:20.96 --> 01:25:24.96
but it was like, don't act tired, even if you are tired.

1210
01:25:24.96 --> 01:25:26.96
Like, don't act tired.

1211
01:25:26.96 --> 01:25:28.96
Because, you know, that's a common thing, especially in the beginning where you're like,

1212
01:25:28.96 --> 01:25:32.96
you have a hard round or hard three rounds or whatever, and then I've hear like,

1213
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:36.96
oh, and you flop on the, on the mat or whatever, you know, and it's like, oh,

1214
01:25:36.96 --> 01:25:38.96
you're acting tired right now.

1215
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:41.96
No, no, it's part of the thing and, you know, what are even when you come home from work.

1216
01:25:41.96 --> 01:25:43.96
Same thing, you know, you flop on the couch.

1217
01:25:43.96 --> 01:25:46.96
What a long day, kind of thing, right, you don't have to do that, you know?

1218
01:25:46.96 --> 01:25:49.96
And there's no real benefit in doing that, like, overall.

1219
01:25:49.96 --> 01:25:53.96
Maybe some short term benefit, maybe some feelings or something, but anyway,

1220
01:25:53.96 --> 01:25:55.96
so when you just say, yeah, I learned that.

1221
01:25:55.96 --> 01:26:00.96
And it's weird how it kind of, your mind and your behavior kind of play off each other, you know?

1222
01:26:00.96 --> 01:26:06.96
Because if, yeah, the more and more I would not, or I would avoid actively avoid acting tired,

1223
01:26:06.96 --> 01:26:08.96
the last time.

1224
01:26:08.96 --> 01:26:10.96
The last time I feel, yeah, it's weird.

1225
01:26:10.96 --> 01:26:14.96
But yeah, that's a big deal. Yeah, and I always have inst still kind of do have,

1226
01:26:14.96 --> 01:26:16.96
I mean, I'm starting to figure it out.

1227
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:19.96
I used to think, prejudices never get tired.

1228
01:26:19.96 --> 01:26:20.96
It's never does it.

1229
01:26:20.96 --> 01:26:22.96
But now I'm trying to figure out, I'm sure you do.

1230
01:26:22.96 --> 01:26:28.96
You just deal with it in certain ways to kind of mask it, you know, like, just way better than what I'm used to.

1231
01:26:28.96 --> 01:26:29.96
This is part of the ongoing debate.

1232
01:26:29.96 --> 01:26:31.96
And it's whether Jako is actually a person.

1233
01:26:31.96 --> 01:26:33.96
You know, human emotions.

1234
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:37.96
You were talking about, you know, when you're making that connection or that light bulb going on,

1235
01:26:37.96 --> 01:26:42.96
on a lot of when we wrote this was you're just trying to help people make the connection sooner in life

1236
01:26:42.96 --> 01:26:45.96
and have some sort of template to get that light bulb to go on.

1237
01:26:45.96 --> 01:26:47.96
That feeling of losing emotion.

1238
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:53.96
I remember at some point early in my military career, it was kind of a cool thing for senior guys to fly.

1239
01:26:53.96 --> 01:26:55.96
It was like a thing.

1240
01:26:55.96 --> 01:26:58.96
And you know, like senior listeners, senior officers to like children or juniors,

1241
01:26:58.96 --> 01:27:01.96
and it was almost like a technique, like a leadership style.

1242
01:27:01.96 --> 01:27:06.96
And I remember thinking every time I saw, every time I saw in the back of my mind,

1243
01:27:06.96 --> 01:27:11.96
I'm thinking how dumb that person looked and how weak that person looked.

1244
01:27:11.96 --> 01:27:17.96
But what for me, what the connection was is that I didn't make the connection at how I looked when I did it.

1245
01:27:17.96 --> 01:27:20.96
Because I would think when I did that, I looked cool.

1246
01:27:20.96 --> 01:27:21.96
I looked like a badass.

1247
01:27:21.96 --> 01:27:25.96
And at some point I started to realize like that feeling that I have about what other people look like.

1248
01:27:25.96 --> 01:27:27.96
That's what other people are seeing in me.

1249
01:27:27.96 --> 01:27:29.96
And it's not cool when I do it.

1250
01:27:29.96 --> 01:27:31.96
I don't do it the right way.

1251
01:27:31.96 --> 01:27:35.96
It's still the same sign of weakness that I was, it was very easy for me to see it in other people.

1252
01:27:35.96 --> 01:27:37.96
And really hard for me to see it myself.

1253
01:27:37.96 --> 01:27:41.96
When I made that connection, that's what made it much easier for me to just stop acting like that.

1254
01:27:41.96 --> 01:27:44.96
And I was never really one of those guys, but earlier in my career,

1255
01:27:44.96 --> 01:27:48.96
I almost kind of like, I copy the example that I was seeing.

1256
01:27:48.96 --> 01:27:52.96
But it always bothered me because it never made sense to me.

1257
01:27:52.96 --> 01:27:59.96
And when I made the connection of, I look as stupid as everybody else that I think looks dumb doing this to other people.

1258
01:27:59.96 --> 01:28:01.96
And that's when I made the connection.

1259
01:28:01.96 --> 01:28:07.96
And just kind of just stop doing it's pretty rare to really, very rare to fly up the handle.

1260
01:28:07.96 --> 01:28:11.96
But even pretty early, it's just show a bunch of emotion because what most of the time when people brought me problems.

1261
01:28:11.96 --> 01:28:15.96
What they need to me, tell them, okay, hey, there's no factor we can solve this.

1262
01:28:15.96 --> 01:28:16.96
This is a solve problem.

1263
01:28:16.96 --> 01:28:18.96
I had pretty much like let's work through the solution.

1264
01:28:18.96 --> 01:28:24.96
And they were happier and more satisfied than if I got emotional with them, I got a round up and they walked out and nothing up fixed.

1265
01:28:24.96 --> 01:28:28.96
Yeah, I think I'm going back to a Delta Charlie who I talked about leadership strategy and tactics.

1266
01:28:28.96 --> 01:28:31.96
My second two commander group of place Skyrim card.

1267
01:28:31.96 --> 01:28:40.96
That guy was so unflappable that I think I remember this time watching him get chewed out by someone.

1268
01:28:40.96 --> 01:28:41.96
Yeah.

1269
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:45.96
You know, like a like a fleet officer, you know, and he was a lieutenant.

1270
01:28:45.96 --> 01:28:50.96
He's a prior-and-listened senior chief, but you know, a lieutenant and some whatever.

1271
01:28:50.96 --> 01:28:53.96
Whatever we did or the both of them did, something happened.

1272
01:28:53.96 --> 01:28:55.96
And you know, he like, you know, Roger that sir.

1273
01:28:55.96 --> 01:28:58.96
And I just thought to myself, wow.

1274
01:28:58.96 --> 01:29:03.96
And then he turned around and just the way he handled it, I'm like man, that's legit.

1275
01:29:03.96 --> 01:29:08.96
And I remember another time one of the guys that put Tung-Gun, who had a trouble, like big trouble.

1276
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:12.96
Borderline, international incident, trouble.

1277
01:29:12.96 --> 01:29:16.96
And I remember I was expecting him.

1278
01:29:16.96 --> 01:29:20.96
And it was somehow I ended up having a conversation with him directly.

1279
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:29.96
And I said something like, he said something like, you know, you got to expect things like this to happen.

1280
01:29:29.96 --> 01:29:36.96
And I was like, day, like he took this whole thing where people are worried about their careers and the freaking,

1281
01:29:36.96 --> 01:29:39.96
ah, that's that, the other thing he goes, you got to expect things like that.

1282
01:29:39.96 --> 01:29:42.96
You know, you know, you know, Jock, you got to expect things like this to happen.

1283
01:29:42.96 --> 01:29:44.96
That was his reaction.

1284
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:47.96
And I'm thinking, this is badass right here.

1285
01:29:47.96 --> 01:29:53.96
This is so badass for him just to, you know, shrug his head a little bit and saying, go to the expect things like this to happen.

1286
01:29:53.96 --> 01:29:56.96
And I thought to myself, damn.

1287
01:29:56.96 --> 01:29:59.96
Imagine this, something crazy is happening.

1288
01:29:59.96 --> 01:30:03.96
And you're the leader, something totally unexpected.

1289
01:30:03.96 --> 01:30:08.96
And you go, you got to expect things like this to happen.

1290
01:30:08.96 --> 01:30:09.96
That's so legit.

1291
01:30:09.96 --> 01:30:14.96
I tried to always be that guy that said, you know, got to expect things like this to happen.

1292
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:30.96
Next section, relationships, which by the way, if if you echelon front, so many answers, boil down to, you know, okay, well, how's your relationship with that person?

1293
01:30:30.96 --> 01:30:34.96
My post does this, that, anything, my support does that, how's your relationship with that person?

1294
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:38.96
And then you hear the moment of silence, you know, because they know that it's not good.

1295
01:30:38.96 --> 01:30:43.96
And then you go, okay, let's start with building relationships where you can actually have a conversation with another human being.

1296
01:30:43.96 --> 01:30:48.96
So relationships are your most powerful tools for long-term success.

1297
01:30:48.96 --> 01:30:50.96
This is true for everyone in life.

1298
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:55.96
You can accomplish much on your own and you need people in your life if you are to reach your fullest potential.

1299
01:30:55.96 --> 01:31:01.96
Since time available to spend with people is limited, you need to get the most out of every minute you have with them.

1300
01:31:01.96 --> 01:31:06.96
Interactions with family members should strengthen relationships, not weaken them.

1301
01:31:06.96 --> 01:31:12.96
Relationships with friends and coworkers should be built up at every opportunity, spending time with the people in your life should be.

1302
01:31:12.96 --> 01:31:17.96
In your life should increase trust, a speed of core and mutual support.

1303
01:31:17.96 --> 01:31:30.96
And I would say one of the, one of the more poignant points I've made in my life is telling people, if I'm going to have a conversation with someone, I'm going to build a relationship.

1304
01:31:30.96 --> 01:31:32.96
Go into it with that.

1305
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:34.96
Go into it with like, I'm going to sit down with Dave.

1306
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:37.96
Look, we have a tough topic to discuss.

1307
01:31:37.96 --> 01:31:40.96
We've got some problems, some issue came up.

1308
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:43.96
My goal going into this is our relationships is going to get better.

1309
01:31:43.96 --> 01:31:44.96
That's the goal.

1310
01:31:44.96 --> 01:31:48.96
And that problem is going to get solved too, but my goal is to build that relationship.

1311
01:31:48.96 --> 01:31:49.96
Yeah.

1312
01:31:49.96 --> 01:31:56.96
If that's your mindset, doing what it says right here, interactions with family members should strengthen relationships, not weaken them.

1313
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:59.96
Think of what that does to your interactions.

1314
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:01.96
Think about what that does to your family.

1315
01:32:01.96 --> 01:32:03.96
If what you're trying to do is build, not weaken.

1316
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:05.96
Friends and coworkers build.

1317
01:32:05.96 --> 01:32:08.96
Every time he's talked to him, build.

1318
01:32:08.96 --> 01:32:12.96
That's the way you win.

1319
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:20.96
And then this last section is preparedness and safety.

1320
01:32:20.96 --> 01:32:23.96
The world can be dangerous and bad things happen.

1321
01:32:23.96 --> 01:32:26.96
Violence is a daily occurrence and can present itself without warning.

1322
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:32.96
You need to be prepared both physically and mentally and ensure that people closest to you are well prepared as well.

1323
01:32:32.96 --> 01:32:38.96
You need to train effectively to respond to a crisis.

1324
01:32:38.96 --> 01:32:43.96
Marshall Arts and Self Defense be able to protect yourself and your family from physical violence.

1325
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:51.96
Weapons training be able to protect your home from intruders or intervening in escape accordingly if required to in public.

1326
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:58.96
And lastly, home safety emergency and disaster have a plan and ensure everyone in your home execute that plan and address stress.

1327
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:02.96
Rehears that plan and assess how prepared your family has.

1328
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:04.96
Have all the required equipment and supplies.

1329
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:08.96
Everyone in your family should know CPR on basic lifesaving steps.

1330
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:12.96
I heard Pat Mack.

1331
01:33:12.96 --> 01:33:14.96
Pat Mack said, what do you say?

1332
01:33:14.96 --> 01:33:18.96
You do is do in one of his little Instagram things.

1333
01:33:18.96 --> 01:33:24.96
And he said, and your family, something along the lines of, you can have assets and liabilities.

1334
01:33:24.96 --> 01:33:26.96
Oh, think about that.

1335
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:28.96
You have assets and liabilities.

1336
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:30.96
So the people in your family, if something happens,

1337
01:33:30.96 --> 01:33:32.96
can either be an asset or liability.

1338
01:33:32.96 --> 01:33:34.96
Where are they at?

1339
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:35.96
Where are they at?

1340
01:33:35.96 --> 01:33:40.96
And what kind of effort are you putting into your family to make sure that when the time comes, they're an asset, not a liability.

1341
01:33:40.96 --> 01:33:42.96
And here's what's cool.

1342
01:33:42.96 --> 01:33:44.96
And I talk about this with firearm training a lot.

1343
01:33:44.96 --> 01:33:47.96
Look, hey, firearm training is awesome.

1344
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:51.96
And if you need to defend yourself, there is no better solution than either,

1345
01:33:51.96 --> 01:33:54.96
oh, okay, I guess avoidance is the best solution.

1346
01:33:54.96 --> 01:33:57.96
But if you are confronted in a situation that you cannot avoid,

1347
01:33:57.96 --> 01:34:00.96
firearm training is the best thing for you, right?

1348
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:02.96
Having a firearm.

1349
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:04.96
But firearm training isn't only good for that.

1350
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:06.96
It helps with all kinds of things.

1351
01:34:06.96 --> 01:34:07.96
It helps your reaction time.

1352
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:08.96
It helps you learn to relax.

1353
01:34:08.96 --> 01:34:09.96
It helps you control your emotions.

1354
01:34:09.96 --> 01:34:12.96
It helps you get your breathing under because it helps with all these other things.

1355
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:14.96
Well, the same thing with family preparedness.

1356
01:34:14.96 --> 01:34:16.96
Oh, it's cool if you start.

1357
01:34:16.96 --> 01:34:20.96
It's cool in a moment of turmoil if you have assets and your family.

1358
01:34:20.96 --> 01:34:23.96
If your family members are assets and not liabilities.

1359
01:34:23.96 --> 01:34:27.96
But not only that, as you teach them things,

1360
01:34:27.96 --> 01:34:31.96
it's makes build a stronger family unit.

1361
01:34:31.96 --> 01:34:33.96
It makes them more prepared for life.

1362
01:34:33.96 --> 01:34:37.96
You're not going to be there all the time for your daughters and your sons.

1363
01:34:37.96 --> 01:34:40.96
They're going to be out there on their own in the world.

1364
01:34:40.96 --> 01:34:42.96
So have them be prepared.

1365
01:34:42.96 --> 01:34:45.96
Yeah, and bad things are going to happen in their life.

1366
01:34:45.96 --> 01:34:47.96
And they need to be prepared for that.

1367
01:34:47.96 --> 01:34:49.96
I remember when we were sort of put this section together,

1368
01:34:49.96 --> 01:34:53.96
and there's one more. But when we're doing this preparedness and safety,

1369
01:34:53.96 --> 01:34:57.96
I was kind of thinking about how am I going to fit into the bigger picture.

1370
01:34:57.96 --> 01:34:59.96
All these things are kind of building on each other.

1371
01:34:59.96 --> 01:35:03.96
And the martial arts and the weapons training kind of came very quickly.

1372
01:35:03.96 --> 01:35:04.96
Like that made sense.

1373
01:35:04.96 --> 01:35:07.96
Just like you just described, you should be able to get away from her problem.

1374
01:35:07.96 --> 01:35:09.96
If you can't, you should be able to take care of yourself or your family.

1375
01:35:09.96 --> 01:35:11.96
And then we started talking about home safety,

1376
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:12.96
emergency, disaster.

1377
01:35:12.96 --> 01:35:15.96
And we had this whole section on this neighborhood community thing.

1378
01:35:15.96 --> 01:35:18.96
And at the time, it was, it was interesting to figure out how it

1379
01:35:18.96 --> 01:35:19.96
works.

1380
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:21.96
And we piece it all together.

1381
01:35:21.96 --> 01:35:26.96
And we added like two words to this after this is all written before this thing going on out.

1382
01:35:26.96 --> 01:35:29.96
This whole COVID-19 thing that everybody is dealing with.

1383
01:35:29.96 --> 01:35:32.96
We added two words, but the rest of it was,

1384
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:34.96
where doesn't, how doesn't this stuff help you?

1385
01:35:34.96 --> 01:35:38.96
Everyone of these things, like you just talked about the weapons training,

1386
01:35:38.96 --> 01:35:40.96
helps you with breathing.

1387
01:35:40.96 --> 01:35:44.96
And like, holy cow, like, would you like to be able to control your heart rate?

1388
01:35:44.96 --> 01:35:46.96
Yes, you can control your heart rate.

1389
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:49.96
I remember learning that for the first time when I was learning how to shoot the pistol.

1390
01:35:49.96 --> 01:35:53.96
And my coach taught me how to breathe and just, and all of a sudden now,

1391
01:35:53.96 --> 01:35:58.96
this thing is having impact across ways that it never thought that there's any connection.

1392
01:35:58.96 --> 01:36:02.96
And it isn't just responding to the crisis, which you absolutely need to be able to do.

1393
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:06.96
It's how that infiltrates all the things that you're doing and all the stuff we talked about

1394
01:36:06.96 --> 01:36:07.96
to.

1395
01:36:07.96 --> 01:36:09.96
And, you know, it's certainly coming full circle with what's going on now.

1396
01:36:09.96 --> 01:36:12.96
But do you want to have a strong relationship with the people in your neighborhood

1397
01:36:12.96 --> 01:36:14.96
to help respond to crisis?

1398
01:36:14.96 --> 01:36:15.96
Yes.

1399
01:36:15.96 --> 01:36:19.96
You do for any number of reasons.

1400
01:36:19.96 --> 01:36:22.96
Yes, the last section is neighborhood community impact,

1401
01:36:22.96 --> 01:36:26.96
developer relationships with other leaders in your neighborhood to protect against violence,

1402
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:32.96
disease, or disaster, and create a safe environment for other residents.

1403
01:36:32.96 --> 01:36:34.96
Is that a good thing?

1404
01:36:34.96 --> 01:36:38.96
You know, is there anyone that's saying no isolate yourself?

1405
01:36:38.96 --> 01:36:40.96
No, don't be prepared to help out.

1406
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:42.96
Do you not have good relationship with your neighbor?

1407
01:36:42.96 --> 01:36:46.96
Yes, and then go as wrong.

1408
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:49.96
They won't be there to help you.

1409
01:36:49.96 --> 01:36:54.96
And, like I said, we wrote this, but we wrote the word disease and disaster in there.

1410
01:36:54.96 --> 01:36:56.96
Because hey, you know what?

1411
01:36:56.96 --> 01:36:58.96
That should be in that, that makes sense.

1412
01:36:58.96 --> 01:37:00.96
But the rest of us was just things we're thinking about.

1413
01:37:00.96 --> 01:37:02.96
How do you be a leader in your neighborhood has that help you?

1414
01:37:02.96 --> 01:37:05.96
How does it benefit you and where else does that affect your life?

1415
01:37:05.96 --> 01:37:08.96
And anybody that's in a community where they know they can rely on other people?

1416
01:37:08.96 --> 01:37:11.96
No, that's important for a whole little reason beyond just what we're dealing with right now.

1417
01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:14.96
And what we're dealing with is how you survive.

1418
01:37:14.96 --> 01:37:17.96
It's covered in move toward it is, and you won't survive alone.

1419
01:37:17.96 --> 01:37:21.96
Dude, I had that, we had massive ranges in San Diego, like 10 days ago.

1420
01:37:21.96 --> 01:37:24.96
Massive range up, and I'm sorry, Carl's bad.

1421
01:37:24.96 --> 01:37:26.96
Not San Diego, you go.

1422
01:37:26.96 --> 01:37:27.96
Thank you.

1423
01:37:27.96 --> 01:37:30.96
And it was 5, 30 in the morning.

1424
01:37:30.96 --> 01:37:35.96
I was awake, but I didn't, and I, and in PCG, I was going on and I heard the rain coming down.

1425
01:37:35.96 --> 01:37:37.96
Turns out my backyard completely was flooding.

1426
01:37:37.96 --> 01:37:42.96
And I'm back there at 530 with brooms and squeegees, just trying to keep the stuff from overflowing

1427
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:43.96
into the house.

1428
01:37:43.96 --> 01:37:48.96
And my right and my left neighbor showed up out my house 10 minutes after they opened.

1429
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:52.96
They got up, they checked their backyards, they checked each other's backyards, and they came to my house and saw me.

1430
01:37:52.96 --> 01:37:53.96
They both grabbed brooms.

1431
01:37:53.96 --> 01:37:55.96
I didn't call them, I didn't text them, I didn't ask them.

1432
01:37:55.96 --> 01:37:57.96
They just made it happen.

1433
01:37:57.96 --> 01:37:58.96
The cover move.

1434
01:37:58.96 --> 01:37:59.96
Cover move.

1435
01:37:59.96 --> 01:38:00.96
Two relationships.

1436
01:38:00.96 --> 01:38:01.96
Yeah, relationships.

1437
01:38:01.96 --> 01:38:06.96
And I obviously would do the same thing for them, but that was a pretty impressive thing for me.

1438
01:38:06.96 --> 01:38:07.96
And I'm like, oh, I did.

1439
01:38:07.96 --> 01:38:10.96
It was kind of look at the one guy who was like, just, it wouldn't dumped on the water.

1440
01:38:10.96 --> 01:38:13.96
And I go, thanks bro, and he's just kind of gave me the head nod.

1441
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:15.96
Like, nothing was really needed to be said or anything.

1442
01:38:15.96 --> 01:38:16.96
He just was there.

1443
01:38:16.96 --> 01:38:17.96
It was good to go, man.

1444
01:38:17.96 --> 01:38:18.96
Nope.

1445
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:19.96
There you go.

1446
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:20.96
That's what we do.

1447
01:38:20.96 --> 01:38:24.96
So those are the things you get graded on the evaluation.

1448
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:27.96
And then we say most people are capable of getting better.

1449
01:38:27.96 --> 01:38:33.96
Once they know the right attributes and understand what the parameters are and how to assess their performance.

1450
01:38:33.96 --> 01:38:36.96
A lot more people will get closer to their goals.

1451
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:38.96
Can we actually get there?

1452
01:38:38.96 --> 01:38:40.96
No, we can't.

1453
01:38:40.96 --> 01:38:44.96
Being eminently qualified isn't a status we achieve or a conclusion we reach.

1454
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:49.96
Being eminently qualified is being on the path that does not end.

1455
01:38:49.96 --> 01:38:55.96
It's the way of living life where we accept that every single day there is more to do.

1456
01:38:55.96 --> 01:39:02.96
The eminently qualified human understands this and recognizes that no matter what success that has been achieved in one place,

1457
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:05.96
there is more to do elsewhere.

1458
01:39:05.96 --> 01:39:12.96
And as we shift our focus from one to the other, that success we just achieved will begin to erode.

1459
01:39:12.96 --> 01:39:17.96
Our gains will decay and we will have to rebuild what we have lost.

1460
01:39:17.96 --> 01:39:23.96
The eminently qualified human knows there is no end.

1461
01:39:23.96 --> 01:39:28.96
Since there is no stopping point on the quest to be coming in eminently qualified human,

1462
01:39:28.96 --> 01:39:33.96
what are we really trying to do? The answer is simple. We are trying to get better every day.

1463
01:39:33.96 --> 01:39:38.96
This requires growth in every facet of personal and professional development.

1464
01:39:38.96 --> 01:39:41.96
This requires action.

1465
01:39:41.96 --> 01:39:43.96
We have to turn our words into action.

1466
01:39:43.96 --> 01:39:45.96
We have to turn our ideas into action.

1467
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:47.96
We have to turn our skills into action.

1468
01:39:47.96 --> 01:39:50.96
We have to turn our goals into action.

1469
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:55.96
There are many resources out there that help us understand what we should,

1470
01:39:55.96 --> 01:39:58.96
how we should behave and what is important.

1471
01:39:58.96 --> 01:40:03.96
What we don't have is an evaluation system for human beings that lets us define our goal,

1472
01:40:03.96 --> 01:40:06.96
identify the critical attributes required to achieve it,

1473
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:11.96
and track our progress along the way until now.

1474
01:40:11.96 --> 01:40:13.96
Here is the evaluation.

1475
01:40:13.96 --> 01:40:15.96
Now we get into this evaluation.

1476
01:40:15.96 --> 01:40:18.96
And all this does is it breaks it down.

1477
01:40:18.96 --> 01:40:21.96
And this is, I guess, the root of,

1478
01:40:21.96 --> 01:40:26.96
when I said, hey, we'll have something out for everyone in a week or whatever I said.

1479
01:40:26.96 --> 01:40:31.96
Whatever, for you know, horrible assessment I made of how long this was going to take.

1480
01:40:31.96 --> 01:40:33.96
This is what we were actually talking about.

1481
01:40:33.96 --> 01:40:37.96
And what it does is it breaks down like what you should be striving for.

1482
01:40:37.96 --> 01:40:43.96
We already went through the categories, but for health, I'll read a couple of these just so people get the general idea.

1483
01:40:43.96 --> 01:40:47.96
Health, physical fitness activities that increase cardiovascular strength,

1484
01:40:47.96 --> 01:40:50.96
flexibility, mobility, daily actions that promote physical health.

1485
01:40:50.96 --> 01:40:52.96
Here's the score of zero.

1486
01:40:52.96 --> 01:40:56.96
Did not perform any activities that contribute to my overall physical fitness level.

1487
01:40:56.96 --> 01:40:58.96
You get a zero that day.

1488
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:01.96
Here's the five highest score you can get.

1489
01:41:01.96 --> 01:41:06.96
Participated in training that reached a level of exertion beyond my perceived limits.

1490
01:41:06.96 --> 01:41:10.96
The most intense physical training that I was capable of performing

1491
01:41:10.96 --> 01:41:13.96
said a new baseline for maximum useful effort.

1492
01:41:13.96 --> 01:41:15.96
So you're going at it.

1493
01:41:15.96 --> 01:41:20.96
Got one for sleep and rest got one for diet nutrition.

1494
01:41:20.96 --> 01:41:22.96
Here's the diet nutrition.

1495
01:41:22.96 --> 01:41:28.96
Did not eat properly and did not provide any nutritional benefit to perform critical daily tasks.

1496
01:41:28.96 --> 01:41:30.96
You get a zero.

1497
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:38.96
The other end of the spectrum consumed ideal food intake and maintained perfect adherence to diet or fasting.

1498
01:41:38.96 --> 01:41:41.96
Every calorie was optimal.

1499
01:41:41.96 --> 01:41:49.96
Nothing was consumed that didn't contribute to health and nutrition, allowing for a sustained peak level of performance throughout the entire day.

1500
01:41:49.96 --> 01:41:52.96
That's what you're aiming for.

1501
01:41:52.96 --> 01:41:55.96
And that's what the eminently qualified person does.

1502
01:41:55.96 --> 01:41:57.96
And that's why a five.

1503
01:41:57.96 --> 01:41:58.96
Not a lot of five.

1504
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:01.96
That's around that same thing with the performance valuation of military.

1505
01:42:01.96 --> 01:42:05.96
You know, it was that five was like, that dude is legit.

1506
01:42:05.96 --> 01:42:07.96
And I look at that and I'm like, nope, that's nothing.

1507
01:42:07.96 --> 01:42:09.96
I'm not a five.

1508
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:14.96
But personal development, next one intellectual fitness time management, financial management, personal goals.

1509
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:17.96
You're going to get graded on each one of these.

1510
01:42:17.96 --> 01:42:21.96
The intellectual fitness one, I'm going to read five.

1511
01:42:21.96 --> 01:42:22.96
Because I like this one.

1512
01:42:22.96 --> 01:42:36.96
Listen, achieved a major breakthrough in understanding, grasp a concept that made significant impact my life and my ability to impart knowledge and skills.

1513
01:42:36.96 --> 01:42:43.96
You always funny about that. Dave, have I ever called you up and said, hey, or sent you a text.

1514
01:42:43.96 --> 01:42:49.96
I sent you a text the other day that was an actual breakthrough in understanding grasp a concept that made significant impact in my life.

1515
01:42:49.96 --> 01:42:50.96
Right.

1516
01:42:50.96 --> 01:42:57.96
That happens like once every, I don't know, three months to me, that I actually do something where I go, oh, dude.

1517
01:42:57.96 --> 01:43:02.96
It doesn't happen often, but those are really good days.

1518
01:43:02.96 --> 01:43:08.96
Like that call with that text became a phone call that came along phone call like, those are good days, man.

1519
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:11.96
Those five are when they happen or so awesome, they're so legit.

1520
01:43:11.96 --> 01:43:12.96
But they don't happen.

1521
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:15.96
No, they don't hardly ever.

1522
01:43:15.96 --> 01:43:20.96
Uh, then you, you, you, you called no, you called me the other day.

1523
01:43:20.96 --> 01:43:25.96
And it was maybe four or five days after we had this legit conversation about a major breakthrough.

1524
01:43:25.96 --> 01:43:28.96
And you go, hey, you got a minute and I go, oh, damn.

1525
01:43:28.96 --> 01:43:32.96
I'm like, this is the call from Dave, he's got the breakthrough coming at me.

1526
01:43:32.96 --> 01:43:33.96
That it was a client call.

1527
01:43:33.96 --> 01:43:36.96
And he was like, you know, let me know what's going on with the client.

1528
01:43:36.96 --> 01:43:39.96
I was like, that said, I said, I thought you had something.

1529
01:43:39.96 --> 01:43:40.96
Sorry.

1530
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:51.96
Uh, yeah, so that one's all about, you know, just personal development and getting better than X1.

1531
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:57.96
The next one is professional development, the little definition productive and impactful, meaningful and lucrative professional life.

1532
01:43:57.96 --> 01:44:06.96
Presuit of and growth in a career field that provides financial security and freedom along with the personal fulfillment and satisfaction.

1533
01:44:06.96 --> 01:44:07.96
Performance.

1534
01:44:07.96 --> 01:44:08.96
Performance.

1535
01:44:08.96 --> 01:44:10.96
Here's a five for performance.

1536
01:44:10.96 --> 01:44:21.96
Outperformed all expectations, vastly exceeded requirements and set new standard for job performance, completed all assignments ahead of schedule with a high degree of accuracy.

1537
01:44:21.96 --> 01:44:34.96
Helped others complete their assigned task, consider the impact of work up, down and across the team and contribute, contributed fully to maximize it.

1538
01:44:34.96 --> 01:44:36.96
That's a five, though.

1539
01:44:36.96 --> 01:44:38.96
It's going to be tough to get.

1540
01:44:38.96 --> 01:44:41.96
Going to be tough to get.

1541
01:44:41.96 --> 01:44:44.96
Here's a zero performed work below the standard.

1542
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:49.96
Didn't not work at all was counterproductive regarding individual and company wide success.

1543
01:44:49.96 --> 01:44:53.96
I'm going to actually photocopy this and blow it up for echo Charles.

1544
01:44:53.96 --> 01:44:57.96
I'm just going to set, you know, like a goal.

1545
01:44:57.96 --> 01:45:00.96
We also kind of set a base on, you know, that's zero.

1546
01:45:00.96 --> 01:45:05.96
You didn't do anything in the five is pretty hard, but there's a little bit of baseline too, like what a one is.

1547
01:45:05.96 --> 01:45:09.96
Because a one on a scale is year to five, not a great score.

1548
01:45:09.96 --> 01:45:14.96
But a one is probably what a lot of people are doing.

1549
01:45:14.96 --> 01:45:16.96
You know, one is.

1550
01:45:16.96 --> 01:45:27.96
Yeah, yeah, here's one completed. This is one performance in your profession completed basic assigned tasks identified areas for tasks where additional guidance.

1551
01:45:27.96 --> 01:45:34.96
For additional four additional guidance in order to complete assignments, but did not perform it in a no worthy manner.

1552
01:45:34.96 --> 01:45:35.96
That's a lot.

1553
01:45:35.96 --> 01:45:39.96
And I think I think when we talked about the Marine Corps.

1554
01:45:39.96 --> 01:45:40.96
Yes.

1555
01:45:40.96 --> 01:45:47.96
Or minimum. Like when you when you're below average, you're doing a beast. You're doing your job.

1556
01:45:47.96 --> 01:45:52.96
That's right. Doing your job is like the minimum and you're kind of a below average Marine.

1557
01:45:52.96 --> 01:45:54.96
This one is like, oh, that's what I do.

1558
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:55.96
Yeah.

1559
01:45:55.96 --> 01:46:03.96
To be the most basic qualification, like the lowest level of qualified because, you know, the the stump, I think says unqualified Marine.

1560
01:46:03.96 --> 01:46:07.96
And that's why there's one of them. Like there's not a lot of unqualified Marines out there.

1561
01:46:07.96 --> 01:46:11.96
But everybody else, if they're qualified, you're a one. You're just you're doing your job.

1562
01:46:11.96 --> 01:46:13.96
You're doing your job. You're doing your job. You're a one.

1563
01:46:13.96 --> 01:46:13.96
Yeah.

1564
01:46:13.96 --> 01:46:21.96
You're doing your one. And that's good to go. But if you're on the path of being the aminally qualified Marine or enemy, you have a long way to go.

1565
01:46:21.96 --> 01:46:24.96
That reap this kind of rebased line. What this scoring system really was about.

1566
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:27.96
You're not getting three's before it's for doing your job.

1567
01:46:27.96 --> 01:46:28.96
You get a one.

1568
01:46:28.96 --> 01:46:34.96
You're going to go above and beyond. And you got to extend yourself in a way you didn't think you could to really improve that score over time.

1569
01:46:34.96 --> 01:46:38.96
This is a scary thing to do to yourself. You know what just made me scared.

1570
01:46:38.96 --> 01:46:42.96
Echo Charles, you're going to like this one because it has to do with lifting.

1571
01:46:42.96 --> 01:46:46.96
You know what I'm saying? How many days you go in there? You've got it done.

1572
01:46:46.96 --> 01:46:49.96
You're kind of proud that you got it done, right?

1573
01:46:49.96 --> 01:46:49.96
Yeah.

1574
01:46:49.96 --> 01:46:51.96
But it's like a one.

1575
01:46:51.96 --> 01:46:52.96
Yeah.

1576
01:46:52.96 --> 01:46:55.96
Like you did you went in and did your duty in the gym. You went. You lifted. You did whatever.

1577
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:57.96
You got a little mac on.

1578
01:46:57.96 --> 01:46:58.96
But you know.

1579
01:46:58.96 --> 01:47:00.96
Right.

1580
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:05.96
How often is it a one? What's a one for physical, the Belle of physical.

1581
01:47:05.96 --> 01:47:08.96
Physical fitness.

1582
01:47:08.96 --> 01:47:10.96
Here's a one.

1583
01:47:10.96 --> 01:47:13.96
Engaged in basic fitness routine or activity.

1584
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:14.96
Yeah.

1585
01:47:14.96 --> 01:47:14.96
Yeah.

1586
01:47:14.96 --> 01:47:16.96
Yeah. That's pretty weak.

1587
01:47:16.96 --> 01:47:18.96
I usually do usually do more than that.

1588
01:47:18.96 --> 01:47:19.96
Yeah.

1589
01:47:19.96 --> 01:47:20.96
And then okay.

1590
01:47:20.96 --> 01:47:23.96
That's to me sounds like you, you know, you took like a an aerobics class.

1591
01:47:23.96 --> 01:47:24.96
Yeah.

1592
01:47:24.96 --> 01:47:28.96
Or like something you could do in the middle of like a barbecue or something like that.

1593
01:47:28.96 --> 01:47:35.96
But two to four is engage in intense physical activity and demanding exercise that increased overall fitness levels while addressing weaker areas.

1594
01:47:35.96 --> 01:47:38.96
That's that's you give yourself between two and four.

1595
01:47:38.96 --> 01:47:40.96
I bet I get a lot of threes.

1596
01:47:40.96 --> 01:47:40.96
Yeah.

1597
01:47:40.96 --> 01:47:41.96
I bet I get a lot of one.

1598
01:47:41.96 --> 01:47:44.96
I'm like, yeah, that was a, you know, I got better.

1599
01:47:44.96 --> 01:47:46.96
But also sometimes I'm to get the main tating.

1600
01:47:46.96 --> 01:47:47.96
Sometimes it's two.

1601
01:47:47.96 --> 01:47:48.96
Yeah.

1602
01:47:48.96 --> 01:47:52.96
Here's the, I think like, well, in my specific case, and I'm sure other people like this too,

1603
01:47:52.96 --> 01:47:56.96
where it's kind of a gift and a curse situation where that, yeah,

1604
01:47:56.96 --> 01:47:58.96
I want to be.

1605
01:47:58.96 --> 01:48:00.96
You might as well not even work out.

1606
01:48:00.96 --> 01:48:06.96
Depending on how long you're, you're putting up ones and zeros, but like a one is not worth the workout.

1607
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:11.96
We're not worth the mental energy, not worth the momentum of what about just the discipline that you got it done.

1608
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:11.96
Okay.

1609
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:11.96
Yeah.

1610
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:12.96
So I give some credit.

1611
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:13.96
There's my curse.

1612
01:48:13.96 --> 01:48:14.96
Yeah, right there.

1613
01:48:14.96 --> 01:48:16.96
To me, it's like, okay, but no, I don't think about that.

1614
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:17.96
Okay.

1615
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:17.96
And stuff.

1616
01:48:17.96 --> 01:48:20.96
Well, now I do not more, but I'm just saying routinely, no.

1617
01:48:20.96 --> 01:48:24.96
But not like, oh, the fact that I did it, I wish it played more of a part of my mind.

1618
01:48:24.96 --> 01:48:25.96
Put it that way.

1619
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:26.96
Yeah.

1620
01:48:26.96 --> 01:48:33.96
When I go live, it's like three, four, sometimes five, or why even live kind of thing.

1621
01:48:33.96 --> 01:48:37.96
But again, that's good because I get good workouts routinely.

1622
01:48:37.96 --> 01:48:42.96
But the junk part is like, if I'm not in the mood to confront that three, four, five,

1623
01:48:42.96 --> 01:48:45.96
it's gonna just be a zero straight up.

1624
01:48:45.96 --> 01:48:48.96
So I'm throwing up more zeros than maybe I should be.

1625
01:48:48.96 --> 01:48:51.96
You seem saying did not work out at all.

1626
01:48:51.96 --> 01:48:52.96
Yeah.

1627
01:48:52.96 --> 01:48:57.96
So those, those, do you stretch if you don't, if you're not, no, let me say this.

1628
01:48:57.96 --> 01:49:01.96
If you're not feeling like you don't feeling like confronting a three, four, five,

1629
01:49:01.96 --> 01:49:02.96
which is a good way of putting it.

1630
01:49:02.96 --> 01:49:06.96
Because that's face it when you're staring at a four, because I got some more.

1631
01:49:06.96 --> 01:49:09.96
Some of my workouts doesn't matter whether you want to put out or not.

1632
01:49:09.96 --> 01:49:11.96
If you execute it, you're doing a five.

1633
01:49:11.96 --> 01:49:12.96
Yeah.

1634
01:49:12.96 --> 01:49:16.96
If you go in there and do it, you're doing at least a four point eight, right?

1635
01:49:16.96 --> 01:49:19.96
Maybe you could hold something back, but it's just going to be pain.

1636
01:49:19.96 --> 01:49:20.96
It's just going to be pain.

1637
01:49:20.96 --> 01:49:24.96
So if you don't feel like confronting that and you go, well, I don't feel like confronting that,

1638
01:49:24.96 --> 01:49:27.96
but I'm going to go stretch and improve my mobility.

1639
01:49:27.96 --> 01:49:28.96
At least you get a one.

1640
01:49:28.96 --> 01:49:35.96
You know, in the words of echo Charles, a one is not nothing.

1641
01:49:35.96 --> 01:49:36.96
It's something.

1642
01:49:36.96 --> 01:49:37.96
And it's something.

1643
01:49:37.96 --> 01:49:40.96
And look, this, we've built this out.

1644
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:43.96
We use that model and try to come up with a human version of that.

1645
01:49:43.96 --> 01:49:47.96
You know, this isn't designed to punish you, but it's a little bit of the recognition.

1646
01:49:47.96 --> 01:49:50.96
Like if you just kind of get up, you get downstairs at the gym,

1647
01:49:50.96 --> 01:49:54.96
and you kind of knock out a workout, hey, look, that's good, right?

1648
01:49:54.96 --> 01:49:56.96
But you're grading yourself on this.

1649
01:49:56.96 --> 01:49:58.96
That's also just a one.

1650
01:49:58.96 --> 01:50:01.96
You just sort of did the basics, the, the base on what you need to do.

1651
01:50:01.96 --> 01:50:02.96
You didn't get better.

1652
01:50:02.96 --> 01:50:03.96
You didn't improve.

1653
01:50:03.96 --> 01:50:04.96
You didn't get faster.

1654
01:50:04.96 --> 01:50:05.96
You didn't get it stronger.

1655
01:50:05.96 --> 01:50:06.96
You might have maintained.

1656
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:08.96
It's a hell of a lot better than a zero, but you also got to be honest

1657
01:50:08.96 --> 01:50:09.96
herself.

1658
01:50:09.96 --> 01:50:12.96
And we're just doing one of like 20 different categories.

1659
01:50:12.96 --> 01:50:15.96
Those ones, as I look at those ones and I'm like, man,

1660
01:50:15.96 --> 01:50:18.96
I do a lot of ones.

1661
01:50:18.96 --> 01:50:21.96
And that keeps me, you know, that keeps me at a one.

1662
01:50:21.96 --> 01:50:22.96
Yeah.

1663
01:50:22.96 --> 01:50:24.96
And if I want that one to become anything else,

1664
01:50:24.96 --> 01:50:27.96
there's a lot of lot more work than needs to be there.

1665
01:50:27.96 --> 01:50:30.96
And again, it's not, it shouldn't punish yourself for a one,

1666
01:50:30.96 --> 01:50:31.96
but you got to recognize it.

1667
01:50:31.96 --> 01:50:32.96
That's what you're doing.

1668
01:50:32.96 --> 01:50:33.96
Guess what you are.

1669
01:50:33.96 --> 01:50:34.96
You're a one.

1670
01:50:34.96 --> 01:50:35.96
And you want to get better?

1671
01:50:35.96 --> 01:50:37.96
You got to put in some work, some real work.

1672
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:39.96
In any of these attributes.

1673
01:50:39.96 --> 01:50:42.96
This is, we're talking right now just one thing.

1674
01:50:42.96 --> 01:50:43.96
That's true for humility.

1675
01:50:43.96 --> 01:50:45.96
It's true for leadership.

1676
01:50:45.96 --> 01:50:46.96
It's true for all kinds of things.

1677
01:50:46.96 --> 01:50:48.96
A one is you coming up and you're doing your job.

1678
01:50:48.96 --> 01:50:49.96
You're coming to work and you're doing your job.

1679
01:50:49.96 --> 01:50:50.96
That's a one.

1680
01:50:50.96 --> 01:50:51.96
Yeah.

1681
01:50:51.96 --> 01:50:52.96
And that's good.

1682
01:50:52.96 --> 01:50:54.96
That's clever to give it numbers like that too.

1683
01:50:54.96 --> 01:50:55.96
Because like who wants to be a one?

1684
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:58.96
Like who wants to roll in be like through up a one.

1685
01:50:58.96 --> 01:50:59.96
I'm a strike one.

1686
01:50:59.96 --> 01:51:03.96
And you want to admit that that they what they've been doing is a one.

1687
01:51:03.96 --> 01:51:05.96
Who wants to really look in the mirror and go, you know what, man?

1688
01:51:05.96 --> 01:51:07.96
I've been cracking out a lot of ones.

1689
01:51:07.96 --> 01:51:08.96
Yes.

1690
01:51:08.96 --> 01:51:09.96
And I'm not as good as I need to be.

1691
01:51:09.96 --> 01:51:10.96
Yeah.

1692
01:51:10.96 --> 01:51:11.96
But ones.

1693
01:51:11.96 --> 01:51:12.96
Those ones don't add up.

1694
01:51:12.96 --> 01:51:16.96
You know, where and they here's part of like the, I guess maybe my ex.

1695
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:19.96
It's partially an excuse really.

1696
01:51:19.96 --> 01:51:20.96
It's like.

1697
01:51:20.96 --> 01:51:26.96
Why even go out there, you know, why out there meaning to the gym or whatever.

1698
01:51:26.96 --> 01:51:28.96
Why even go to the gym if it's just going to be a one.

1699
01:51:28.96 --> 01:51:32.96
If I if I can smell the one coming on like why even bother with that.

1700
01:51:32.96 --> 01:51:38.96
Because what what's that going to do to my brain is it going to get me a little bit more used to throwing up ones.

1701
01:51:38.96 --> 01:51:41.96
How many times you're going to do a one you end up with a three?

1702
01:51:41.96 --> 01:51:42.96
Yeah.

1703
01:51:42.96 --> 01:51:47.96
I mean technically I'm going in with the goal of a three.

1704
01:51:47.96 --> 01:51:50.96
And then I get like a four or something like that.

1705
01:51:50.96 --> 01:51:54.96
But it's always like a baseline high level high standard workout.

1706
01:51:54.96 --> 01:51:57.96
That's and that's why I used to skip workout so much because I'm like man, I can't.

1707
01:51:57.96 --> 01:51:58.96
I can't do it.

1708
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:04.96
If I had the mindset, oh, I could just go in and stretch and maybe warm up or if I ever had that mindset,

1709
01:52:04.96 --> 01:52:06.96
it's like, rather that's easy to make it in the gym.

1710
01:52:06.96 --> 01:52:09.96
But then I can, I guess thinking about it more that that could just help you.

1711
01:52:09.96 --> 01:52:13.96
Because you know how when you get in there, you're like, oh, I read something the other day.

1712
01:52:13.96 --> 01:52:18.96
I think it was you set up yourself up for three minutes of practice on guitar.

1713
01:52:18.96 --> 01:52:19.96
Yeah.

1714
01:52:19.96 --> 01:52:21.96
Like hey, you got to practice three minutes a day.

1715
01:52:21.96 --> 01:52:22.96
That's it.

1716
01:52:22.96 --> 01:52:23.96
Three minutes.

1717
01:52:23.96 --> 01:52:26.96
Tell me you can't find three minutes.

1718
01:52:26.96 --> 01:52:33.96
And what they know the power behind this is if you get out your guitar and you get it in your hands and you,

1719
01:52:33.96 --> 01:52:37.96
you know pull out your guitar pick and you start strumming.

1720
01:52:37.96 --> 01:52:39.96
It's going to be at least seven minutes, right?

1721
01:52:39.96 --> 01:52:41.96
It's going to be 12 minutes.

1722
01:52:41.96 --> 01:52:42.96
The hardest part was going on.

1723
01:52:42.96 --> 01:52:44.96
I don't feel like practicing for an hour right now.

1724
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:46.96
You don't need to practice for three minutes.

1725
01:52:46.96 --> 01:52:48.96
And if that turns out to be 12, cool.

1726
01:52:48.96 --> 01:52:49.96
Yeah.

1727
01:52:49.96 --> 01:52:50.96
Yeah.

1728
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:56.96
I guess like if you, but then I guess the other part of my little maybe it's partially excuse.

1729
01:52:56.96 --> 01:52:57.96
Maybe it's legit.

1730
01:52:57.96 --> 01:52:58.96
I don't know.

1731
01:52:58.96 --> 01:52:59.96
But it's like a judge.

1732
01:52:59.96 --> 01:53:03.96
I don't want to get into that routine of setting low bars.

1733
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:05.96
You know, as a goal of a workout.

1734
01:53:05.96 --> 01:53:07.96
You know what?

1735
01:53:07.96 --> 01:53:08.96
Here's what happens to me.

1736
01:53:08.96 --> 01:53:10.96
I will be like sore.

1737
01:53:10.96 --> 01:53:11.96
I'll have.

1738
01:53:11.96 --> 01:53:12.96
Oh, that's a zero.

1739
01:53:12.96 --> 01:53:13.96
That's a rest there.

1740
01:53:13.96 --> 01:53:14.96
There.

1741
01:53:14.96 --> 01:53:15.96
No, I'll have big thumbs.

1742
01:53:15.96 --> 01:53:21.96
But what I'll do is I'll go in and be like, okay, maintenance day, maintenance routine, run the maintenance routine.

1743
01:53:21.96 --> 01:53:28.96
I'll just do like some arrow or hit a hit the aerosol bike for a few hundred calories or whatever.

1744
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:33.96
And then just, yeah, kind of take a, that's a, it's a one.

1745
01:53:33.96 --> 01:53:34.96
Yeah.

1746
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:35.96
Well, but it's not a zero.

1747
01:53:35.96 --> 01:53:39.96
Yeah, but then again, if it's like, if you have thumbs and you need recovery, that's the,

1748
01:53:39.96 --> 01:53:43.96
thumbs are just indicated that you need recovery kind, you know, there's more to it than that for sure.

1749
01:53:43.96 --> 01:53:44.96
But it's a good fight.

1750
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:46.96
It's a, you mean, indicate it right.

1751
01:53:46.96 --> 01:53:51.96
So if you for real believe for real believe not convinced yourself or, you know, made an extra, but if you

1752
01:53:51.96 --> 01:53:54.96
for a believe that you need recover or recovery.

1753
01:53:54.96 --> 01:54:02.96
And you go in and just to get the blood flowing, get some stretch, some mobility stuff, whatever that could wind up, not being an exertion hard hard core workout.

1754
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:05.96
But literally achieving the goal of that workout.

1755
01:54:05.96 --> 01:54:06.96
Same thing.

1756
01:54:06.96 --> 01:54:11.96
Because if you do some hard core work out when you're in your recovery, so you could get a, a foreign recovery,

1757
01:54:11.96 --> 01:54:13.96
we get a for like, the little ability.

1758
01:54:13.96 --> 01:54:14.96
Texting there.

1759
01:54:14.96 --> 01:54:15.96
It seems like you could.

1760
01:54:15.96 --> 01:54:16.96
Yeah.

1761
01:54:16.96 --> 01:54:17.96
All right.

1762
01:54:17.96 --> 01:54:19.96
Next section's character and leadership.

1763
01:54:19.96 --> 01:54:30.96
And again, you know, the emotional controls in there, what the zero for emotional controls lost control of emotions when interacting with people around me during the stressful encounter.

1764
01:54:30.96 --> 01:54:34.96
Set back any progress toward controlling emotions.

1765
01:54:34.96 --> 01:54:37.96
Actually, it should have been a low stress encounter, right?

1766
01:54:37.96 --> 01:54:38.96
That would be the worst.

1767
01:54:38.96 --> 01:54:40.96
You're in a low stress encounter and you get emotional.

1768
01:54:40.96 --> 01:54:44.96
We have to change that because the other end of this spectrum is maintained,

1769
01:54:44.96 --> 01:54:49.96
or maintained emotions under the rest in the most difficult situation possible.

1770
01:54:49.96 --> 01:54:50.96
Because that's true.

1771
01:54:50.96 --> 01:54:52.96
Like that's that you get credit for that.

1772
01:54:52.96 --> 01:54:53.96
You could have five things are going crazy.

1773
01:54:53.96 --> 01:54:59.96
You maintain was able to immediately identify my own red flags or those of people around me to touch and make ideal decision to get the best possible.

1774
01:54:59.96 --> 01:55:02.96
Outcome that otherwise would have been missed.

1775
01:55:02.96 --> 01:55:05.96
The best possible outcome.

1776
01:55:05.96 --> 01:55:06.96
Yeah.

1777
01:55:06.96 --> 01:55:10.96
And that's under most difficult situation.

1778
01:55:10.96 --> 01:55:11.96
Yeah.

1779
01:55:11.96 --> 01:55:12.96
Because that's easy to follow.

1780
01:55:12.96 --> 01:55:15.96
You actually need your environment needs to help you get a five vote.

1781
01:55:15.96 --> 01:55:17.96
If you're not dealing this, you're getting a five vote.

1782
01:55:17.96 --> 01:55:18.96
Yeah.

1783
01:55:18.96 --> 01:55:20.96
I mean, that's why the one is what the one is.

1784
01:55:20.96 --> 01:55:21.96
Yeah.

1785
01:55:21.96 --> 01:55:26.96
I maintained control of my emotions and normal situations was aware of periods of heightened emotions.

1786
01:55:26.96 --> 01:55:29.96
I did not let them get out of control.

1787
01:55:29.96 --> 01:55:32.96
If you had a normal day and nothing really went on your day,

1788
01:55:32.96 --> 01:55:34.96
you didn't even have the chance for a five.

1789
01:55:34.96 --> 01:55:35.96
So you get a one.

1790
01:55:35.96 --> 01:55:36.96
You get a one.

1791
01:55:36.96 --> 01:55:37.96
Yeah.

1792
01:55:37.96 --> 01:55:39.96
And you talk to the hit this is kind of scary thing.

1793
01:55:39.96 --> 01:55:42.96
The scary ones are the one like dude, that's most of my days.

1794
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:43.96
Yeah.

1795
01:55:43.96 --> 01:55:44.96
Guess what?

1796
01:55:44.96 --> 01:55:47.96
You weren't in even in a situation to respond like that.

1797
01:55:47.96 --> 01:55:53.96
You did not have this overwhelming situation where tons of emotions were coming out because you just had a regular normal day.

1798
01:55:53.96 --> 01:55:55.96
But you don't get credit for that either.

1799
01:55:55.96 --> 01:55:56.96
Yeah.

1800
01:55:56.96 --> 01:55:57.96
You know, it's cool.

1801
01:55:57.96 --> 01:55:59.96
You add your gist into your day and all of a sudden you can get a two for sure.

1802
01:55:59.96 --> 01:56:03.96
You can get a two for sure because you're getting emotional like there's going to be stress moments.

1803
01:56:03.96 --> 01:56:05.96
You get, you know, you're getting.

1804
01:56:05.96 --> 01:56:06.96
Whatever.

1805
01:56:06.96 --> 01:56:11.96
That's character and leadership relationships in there.

1806
01:56:11.96 --> 01:56:12.96
That emotional one.

1807
01:56:12.96 --> 01:56:13.96
Yeah.

1808
01:56:13.96 --> 01:56:16.96
That was a good little addition when you say the best possible outcome.

1809
01:56:16.96 --> 01:56:18.96
Because because let's face it.

1810
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:21.96
Some people can dilude themselves with the emotional outburst.

1811
01:56:21.96 --> 01:56:23.96
You know, how just kind of how you mentioned like some people,

1812
01:56:23.96 --> 01:56:29.96
they do their little emotional tirade and then they're, they kind of feel solid like yeah, I probably look pretty powerful in that moment.

1813
01:56:29.96 --> 01:56:31.96
So they almost have this little sense of pride.

1814
01:56:31.96 --> 01:56:40.96
But they ignore kind of the outcome, you know, they just, they focus too much in my opinion on how they felt at the moment and then they're kind of recalling that feeling and they did.

1815
01:56:40.96 --> 01:56:44.96
They kind of chalk it up as a little bit of a little success moment.

1816
01:56:44.96 --> 01:56:47.96
They're giving themselves a five when they really didn't get the best possible outcome.

1817
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:48.96
Yeah.

1818
01:56:48.96 --> 01:56:50.96
Because they saw some movie where it looked cool or whatever sort of thing.

1819
01:56:50.96 --> 01:56:54.96
I looked like Christopher Rockin or whatever, whoever he looked like or whatever.

1820
01:56:54.96 --> 01:56:56.96
Meanwhile, the outcome is all terrible.

1821
01:56:56.96 --> 01:56:57.96
You seem insane.

1822
01:56:57.96 --> 01:57:00.96
Yeah, that's a good like did.

1823
01:57:00.96 --> 01:57:02.96
Cool.

1824
01:57:02.96 --> 01:57:04.96
I'll leave it at that.

1825
01:57:04.96 --> 01:57:10.96
Relationships, quality time with your family, quality time with friends and coworkers.

1826
01:57:10.96 --> 01:57:12.96
The next one's preparedness and safety.

1827
01:57:12.96 --> 01:57:14.96
You know, did you train martial arts?

1828
01:57:14.96 --> 01:57:15.96
Did you do weapons training?

1829
01:57:15.96 --> 01:57:17.96
Did you do fire safety emergency training?

1830
01:57:17.96 --> 01:57:21.96
Did you get connect with your neighborhood in your community?

1831
01:57:21.96 --> 01:57:26.96
Here's a, here's a score of two to four.

1832
01:57:26.96 --> 01:57:33.96
What for martial arts was part of aggressive training and significant learning that advanced my ability for self defense.

1833
01:57:33.96 --> 01:57:37.96
Learned important new skills and techniques and made major improvement.

1834
01:57:37.96 --> 01:57:39.96
I, I rarely hit that.

1835
01:57:39.96 --> 01:57:40.96
Me too.

1836
01:57:40.96 --> 01:57:42.96
Now in the beginning, it's easier to hit back.

1837
01:57:42.96 --> 01:57:43.96
Yeah, you're learning more.

1838
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:44.96
Yeah.

1839
01:57:44.96 --> 01:57:45.96
But dang.

1840
01:57:45.96 --> 01:57:47.96
I want someone to block that like echo.

1841
01:57:47.96 --> 01:57:51.96
Yeah.

1842
01:57:51.96 --> 01:57:52.96
Weapons training.

1843
01:57:52.96 --> 01:57:54.96
Let's see if I'm biased when I wrote these.

1844
01:57:54.96 --> 01:58:00.96
Participated in an aggressive training and significant learning that advanced my weapons proficiency and comfort.

1845
01:58:00.96 --> 01:58:05.96
A acquired new equipment and skills that enhance self confidence and ability with self defense.

1846
01:58:05.96 --> 01:58:07.96
No, actually that's a, that's a, that's solid.

1847
01:58:07.96 --> 01:58:08.96
Is that well written?

1848
01:58:08.96 --> 01:58:10.96
Yeah, it's solid.

1849
01:58:10.96 --> 01:58:11.96
What is that?

1850
01:58:11.96 --> 01:58:13.96
Did you write that?

1851
01:58:13.96 --> 01:58:16.96
I'm trying to think of.

1852
01:58:16.96 --> 01:58:22.96
I thought I might skew it or I thought we might skew it towards.

1853
01:58:22.96 --> 01:58:27.96
Like, as long as you shot today, you're good.

1854
01:58:27.96 --> 01:58:28.96
Yeah.

1855
01:58:28.96 --> 01:58:32.96
Like as long as you've got rounds down range, that's a, that's a one you think?

1856
01:58:32.96 --> 01:58:34.96
Well, you're engaged in limited.

1857
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:36.96
Here's a one in weapons training.

1858
01:58:36.96 --> 01:58:42.96
Engage in limited training to maintain proficiency but took no steps towards acquiring needed weapons or advanced proficiency.

1859
01:58:42.96 --> 01:58:43.96
Yeah.

1860
01:58:43.96 --> 01:58:49.96
That's, that means you got on the range and you still get just a one.

1861
01:58:49.96 --> 01:58:52.96
You know, maybe drive fire to you still get a little bit of a one.

1862
01:58:52.96 --> 01:58:53.96
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1863
01:58:53.96 --> 01:58:56.96
What if you didn't go to the range but you drive fire, maybe this is what we're saying.

1864
01:58:56.96 --> 01:58:57.96
It's hard to get.

1865
01:58:57.96 --> 01:58:58.96
It's hard to win.

1866
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:01.96
It's hard to be a three, four, five.

1867
01:59:01.96 --> 01:59:02.96
Yeah.

1868
01:59:02.96 --> 01:59:06.96
Uh, and then it goes on to explain this.

1869
01:59:06.96 --> 01:59:07.96
Yeah.

1870
01:59:07.96 --> 01:59:08.96
Yeah.

1871
01:59:08.96 --> 01:59:09.96
Exactly.

1872
01:59:09.96 --> 01:59:10.96
Exactly.

1873
01:59:10.96 --> 01:59:12.96
I don't know what you can twice a month.

1874
01:59:12.96 --> 01:59:14.96
Like bro, to twice a month doesn't get you there.

1875
01:59:14.96 --> 01:59:15.96
Yeah.

1876
01:59:15.96 --> 01:59:16.96
No.

1877
01:59:16.96 --> 01:59:19.96
That up at all.

1878
01:59:19.96 --> 01:59:26.96
Wrap up to kind of explain the evaluation and then what to do if you fall off the path.

1879
01:59:26.96 --> 01:59:39.96
And this leads to, I think this part about the evaluation about how this works is actually kind of important to think about how you are going to approach that nature.

1880
01:59:39.96 --> 01:59:45.96
And how you're going to assess yourself and what it really means to give yourself any of these grades and what's really going on there.

1881
01:59:45.96 --> 01:59:57.96
Well, it says it is designed is not designed just to grade yourself, but also so you know that you're trying what you're trying to become a requires humility and brutally honest self assessment.

1882
01:59:57.96 --> 01:59:59.96
No one else is scoring you.

1883
01:59:59.96 --> 02:00:00.96
Don't compare yourself to others.

1884
02:00:00.96 --> 02:00:04.96
This is about your capacity compared to your performance.

1885
02:00:04.96 --> 02:00:07.96
Oh, that's what Charles likes that.

1886
02:00:07.96 --> 02:00:10.96
It's your capacity compared to your performance.

1887
02:00:10.96 --> 02:00:12.96
It's you against you.

1888
02:00:12.96 --> 02:00:18.96
Ask yourself how much effort you put into something and measure it against what you are capable of.

1889
02:00:18.96 --> 02:00:23.96
The more effort you put into something, the more progress you will make.

1890
02:00:23.96 --> 02:00:25.96
This is different from person to person.

1891
02:00:25.96 --> 02:00:28.96
And different for yourself as time goes on.

1892
02:00:28.96 --> 02:00:32.96
If you've never exercised before in your life and you walk a mile, you may have exerted yourself close to the limit.

1893
02:00:32.96 --> 02:00:34.96
That might be a five.

1894
02:00:34.96 --> 02:00:40.96
That same workout might be a one for someone who's been in the gym for years. It might even be a.

1895
02:00:40.96 --> 02:00:41.96
Yeah, might even be a zero.

1896
02:00:41.96 --> 02:00:49.96
But as you get better and improve that one mile walk no longer represents your maximum capacity so it no longer represents a five for you.

1897
02:00:49.96 --> 02:00:54.96
As you move down the path towards an enimently qualified human, your capacity will increase as a result.

1898
02:00:54.96 --> 02:00:57.96
Improving actually becomes more difficult over time.

1899
02:00:57.96 --> 02:01:02.96
You have to work even harder and do more to make even the same amount or even less of an improvement.

1900
02:01:02.96 --> 02:01:09.96
This system only works if you understand what you're capable of and if you're honest about what you have done being easy on yourself doesn't help.

1901
02:01:09.96 --> 02:01:12.96
You or the people in your life you must commit.

1902
02:01:12.96 --> 02:01:15.96
You must stay on the path.

1903
02:01:15.96 --> 02:01:22.96
So yeah, we all know that the stronger you get the harder it becomes to get stronger.

1904
02:01:22.96 --> 02:01:25.96
The better you get it to you the harder it becomes to get better at you.

1905
02:01:25.96 --> 02:01:29.96
Which is weird because there's a ramp up session even with working out.

1906
02:01:29.96 --> 02:01:33.96
You know, think about this, but when someone just starts working out for a little while, they can't do it.

1907
02:01:33.96 --> 02:01:37.96
Do the exercise, they got domes every day and they're just not really making the gains.

1908
02:01:37.96 --> 02:01:42.96
But then after a little while they start going, oh, same thing with your jitz or you start learning in all of a sudden you can process it.

1909
02:01:42.96 --> 02:01:43.96
Like I think you're optimum.

1910
02:01:43.96 --> 02:01:46.96
I think where you're learning the most is probably when you're a blue belt.

1911
02:01:46.96 --> 02:01:47.96
Do you think?

1912
02:01:47.96 --> 02:01:50.96
Yeah, it depends on what you mean by what you're learning.

1913
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:54.96
So you're learning the most information is being absorbed.

1914
02:01:54.96 --> 02:01:56.96
Yeah, the big strides.

1915
02:01:56.96 --> 02:01:59.96
I think you're right at a white belt.

1916
02:01:59.96 --> 02:02:01.96
That's when you're learning the most moves.

1917
02:02:01.96 --> 02:02:02.96
I'll tell you that thing that.

1918
02:02:02.96 --> 02:02:05.96
But you can't assimilate the maybe it's a high end of white belt.

1919
02:02:05.96 --> 02:02:08.96
Yeah, I'm sure it's a real silver on in that zone.

1920
02:02:08.96 --> 02:02:10.96
And working out it is a common thing.

1921
02:02:10.96 --> 02:02:13.96
Well, I think in trainers or in the training community, that's a normal thing.

1922
02:02:13.96 --> 02:02:15.96
It's called newbie gains.

1923
02:02:15.96 --> 02:02:18.96
So you get gains in the beginning way more than towards the end.

1924
02:02:18.96 --> 02:02:21.96
So like if you're advanced, lift or bodybuild or whatever.

1925
02:02:21.96 --> 02:02:23.96
Yeah, your gains come slowly.

1926
02:02:23.96 --> 02:02:26.96
But the new guys newbie gains.

1927
02:02:26.96 --> 02:02:27.96
Newbie gains.

1928
02:02:27.96 --> 02:02:29.96
That's what they call it.

1929
02:02:29.96 --> 02:02:30.96
That's what you know.

1930
02:02:30.96 --> 02:02:32.96
I'm just saying it's a thing.

1931
02:02:32.96 --> 02:02:38.96
Next section, what do you do when you fall off the path?

1932
02:02:38.96 --> 02:02:41.96
You can't and we'll fall off the path.

1933
02:02:41.96 --> 02:02:43.96
It happens every once, sometimes we do it to ourselves.

1934
02:02:43.96 --> 02:02:46.96
Sometimes life hits or something we didn't see coming.

1935
02:02:46.96 --> 02:02:48.96
People get sick, accidents occur.

1936
02:02:48.96 --> 02:02:49.96
Things happen to the world.

1937
02:02:49.96 --> 02:02:52.96
We can't control and those things can push us off the path.

1938
02:02:52.96 --> 02:02:55.96
But you can control how you react when you fall off.

1939
02:02:55.96 --> 02:02:59.96
What you do to get yourself back on the path that's up to you.

1940
02:02:59.96 --> 02:03:01.96
The situation doesn't dictate what happens to you.

1941
02:03:01.96 --> 02:03:03.96
You dictate the situation.

1942
02:03:03.96 --> 02:03:07.96
You decide when you fall off the path, ask yourself why.

1943
02:03:07.96 --> 02:03:12.96
Why are you not doing the things you know you should do an unsparing self assessment.

1944
02:03:12.96 --> 02:03:16.96
Identify corrective measures and ruthlessly implement those measures.

1945
02:03:16.96 --> 02:03:17.96
Take action.

1946
02:03:17.96 --> 02:03:20.96
Get back on the path.

1947
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:24.96
For anything that affects your health or mind of your health.

1948
02:03:24.96 --> 02:03:26.96
For anything that affects the health of your mind or body,

1949
02:03:26.96 --> 02:03:29.96
see your doctor or professional in the field.

1950
02:03:29.96 --> 02:03:31.96
Sometimes you've got to go to a mechanic.

1951
02:03:31.96 --> 02:03:32.96
That's a doctor.

1952
02:03:32.96 --> 02:03:34.96
That's a psychologist.

1953
02:03:34.96 --> 02:03:39.96
This is not a time to rely on friends or family members.

1954
02:03:39.96 --> 02:03:40.96
You need professional help.

1955
02:03:40.96 --> 02:03:41.96
So get it.

1956
02:03:41.96 --> 02:03:44.96
That being said, there are protocols to help get you back on the path.

1957
02:03:44.96 --> 02:03:45.96
These are some protocols.

1958
02:03:45.96 --> 02:03:48.96
And again, I talked about where these came from.

1959
02:03:48.96 --> 02:03:51.96
I'll do this one.

1960
02:03:51.96 --> 02:03:55.96
I don't want to do them all, but I'll do this one.

1961
02:03:55.96 --> 02:03:56.96
Break up.

1962
02:03:56.96 --> 02:04:02.96
I don't know why I'm doing this one because there's like you put out a video and everything of this one.

1963
02:04:02.96 --> 02:04:06.96
Here's the clean version.

1964
02:04:06.96 --> 02:04:08.96
Here's like here's what you do.

1965
02:04:08.96 --> 02:04:09.96
Break up.

1966
02:04:09.96 --> 02:04:12.96
My relationship is over and I don't know what to do.

1967
02:04:12.96 --> 02:04:14.96
Number one, detach.

1968
02:04:14.96 --> 02:04:17.96
Your emotions are your enemy during a breakup.

1969
02:04:17.96 --> 02:04:20.96
They will not enable you to make good decisions or make good choices.

1970
02:04:20.96 --> 02:04:22.96
Of course, this will be hard.

1971
02:04:22.96 --> 02:04:25.96
The core of relationships is built on emotions.

1972
02:04:25.96 --> 02:04:28.96
So in order to detach from your emotions, take a step back.

1973
02:04:28.96 --> 02:04:31.96
Look at the situation from someone else's point of view.

1974
02:04:31.96 --> 02:04:33.96
You might think no one else understands and you are right.

1975
02:04:33.96 --> 02:04:36.96
They don't understand the emotions you have.

1976
02:04:36.96 --> 02:04:41.96
But that means the emotions are not blinding them.

1977
02:04:41.96 --> 02:04:42.96
Try to see that.

1978
02:04:42.96 --> 02:04:46.96
If you have trouble detaching, go to step 1A.

1979
02:04:46.96 --> 02:04:49.96
It might also help to let your emotions out.

1980
02:04:49.96 --> 02:04:52.96
But do so in a way that does not affect the situation.

1981
02:04:52.96 --> 02:04:56.96
Find a private place where you can scream, cry, or otherwise release your emotions.

1982
02:04:56.96 --> 02:05:00.96
Try physically exerting yourself to get rid of the emotional aggression.

1983
02:05:00.96 --> 02:05:03.96
Hit a punching bag, go for a run.

1984
02:05:03.96 --> 02:05:06.96
Be, repeat step 1A as needed.

1985
02:05:06.96 --> 02:05:10.96
Gotta get those emotions out sometimes.

1986
02:05:10.96 --> 02:05:12.96
That's a way to detach.

1987
02:05:12.96 --> 02:05:19.96
To assess the person you have separated from and evaluate who they actually are.

1988
02:05:19.96 --> 02:05:22.96
So this is why it's important to detach before you do this.

1989
02:05:22.96 --> 02:05:27.96
To assess the person you have separated from and evaluate who they actually are.

1990
02:05:27.96 --> 02:05:30.96
The truth is that person is not who you thought they were.

1991
02:05:30.96 --> 02:05:33.96
The person you cared about does not exist.

1992
02:05:33.96 --> 02:05:38.96
The idea that this person was a trustworthy faithful companion is not true.

1993
02:05:38.96 --> 02:05:45.96
You created an ideal around their framework, but they do not actually exist.

1994
02:05:45.96 --> 02:05:48.96
They have proven they do not exist by their actions.

1995
02:05:48.96 --> 02:05:55.96
Do not dwell on what it was because it wasn't.

1996
02:05:55.96 --> 02:05:59.96
Do not dwell on what it could have been because it couldn't.

1997
02:05:59.96 --> 02:06:01.96
It was a lie.

1998
02:06:01.96 --> 02:06:03.96
Which is this you see so many.

1999
02:06:03.96 --> 02:06:10.96
And I guess I'm going to talk about it from a guy perspective because in the teams you

2000
02:06:10.96 --> 02:06:15.96
get guys that would break up with the girl and that's why I saw it over and over again from the guy perspective.

2001
02:06:15.96 --> 02:06:17.96
And that's what they know.

2002
02:06:17.96 --> 02:06:23.96
It was she was so good and we could have and it's always that hanging on to this lie.

2003
02:06:23.96 --> 02:06:24.96
And it's a lie.

2004
02:06:24.96 --> 02:06:25.96
It's not true.

2005
02:06:25.96 --> 02:06:26.96
That person doesn't exist.

2006
02:06:26.96 --> 02:06:30.96
That girl that you thought you were going to marry and everything's going to be,

2007
02:06:30.96 --> 02:06:37.96
oh no, not going to work because she didn't exist.

2008
02:06:37.96 --> 02:06:41.96
Step number three, be thankful.

2009
02:06:41.96 --> 02:06:47.96
Be thankful that this lie was uncovered now instead of later before you invested even more into that person.

2010
02:06:47.96 --> 02:06:51.96
That person who you now realized was not who you thought they were.

2011
02:06:51.96 --> 02:06:55.96
Be thankful that you found out when you did that this person is untrustworthy.

2012
02:06:55.96 --> 02:06:58.96
Be thankful that you can now move forward.

2013
02:06:58.96 --> 02:07:01.96
Oh man, it's tough to tell.

2014
02:07:01.96 --> 02:07:07.96
To tell that to the crying human.

2015
02:07:07.96 --> 02:07:11.96
No, step number four, wish them luck.

2016
02:07:11.96 --> 02:07:17.96
Yes, perhaps it is a final conversation, perhaps it is a note, but wish them luck.

2017
02:07:17.96 --> 02:07:19.96
They are going to need it.

2018
02:07:19.96 --> 02:07:21.96
Do not harbor any ill feelings.

2019
02:07:21.96 --> 02:07:24.96
Those ill feelings do you know good.

2020
02:07:24.96 --> 02:07:33.96
Number you, not as a spiteful vindictive slave to your emotions and whims, but as a good mature person ready to move on positively in the world.

2021
02:07:33.96 --> 02:07:39.96
That's one of those things where luck.

2022
02:07:39.96 --> 02:07:42.96
Let me continue on before I get into this.

2023
02:07:42.96 --> 02:07:45.96
Walk, step number five, walk away.

2024
02:07:45.96 --> 02:07:49.96
You know this person is not who you wanted them to be and you can't change that.

2025
02:07:49.96 --> 02:07:51.96
So walk away, move on.

2026
02:07:51.96 --> 02:07:53.96
Don't look back.

2027
02:07:53.96 --> 02:07:55.96
Step number six, don't look back.

2028
02:07:55.96 --> 02:07:57.96
Your mind will page play tricks on you.

2029
02:07:57.96 --> 02:08:01.96
You will lie to yourself, tell yourself that maybe it can work and maybe it was wrong.

2030
02:08:01.96 --> 02:08:04.96
And if I can just try one more time, maybe he or she will change.

2031
02:08:04.96 --> 02:08:07.96
No, that's not happening.

2032
02:08:07.96 --> 02:08:09.96
They aren't going to change.

2033
02:08:09.96 --> 02:08:16.96
And the fact the matter is the more you crawl back to them, the more you big little yourself and push them further away.

2034
02:08:16.96 --> 02:08:17.96
Don't do it.

2035
02:08:17.96 --> 02:08:18.96
Walk away.

2036
02:08:18.96 --> 02:08:22.96
Don't look back.

2037
02:08:22.96 --> 02:08:31.96
And that's the part that I was going to kind of venture into is if you're in one of these situations where you like all of it will need.

2038
02:08:31.96 --> 02:08:32.96
I could say one more thing.

2039
02:08:32.96 --> 02:08:34.96
And that is what drives people away.

2040
02:08:34.96 --> 02:08:36.96
That's what they don't respect and they don't like.

2041
02:08:36.96 --> 02:08:40.96
So the best possible thing you can do is say hey, good luck.

2042
02:08:40.96 --> 02:08:41.96
I'll see you later.

2043
02:08:41.96 --> 02:08:42.96
Walk away and don't look back.

2044
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:47.96
The minute you look back and throw out the lifeline and beg for whatever.

2045
02:08:47.96 --> 02:08:50.96
They want to get rid of you even more.

2046
02:08:50.96 --> 02:08:54.96
So the best possible thing you can do.

2047
02:08:54.96 --> 02:08:58.96
The win win move is walk away and don't look back.

2048
02:08:58.96 --> 02:09:00.96
It's the win win move.

2049
02:09:00.96 --> 02:09:02.96
And then seven get back on the path.

2050
02:09:02.96 --> 02:09:06.96
Wake up early, work out, read, write, learn, play an instrument.

2051
02:09:06.96 --> 02:09:09.96
Train your jets who eat clean, clean your room, clean your car, get ahead of work.

2052
02:09:09.96 --> 02:09:13.96
When someone breaks your trust, when someone breaks our trust, we question ourselves.

2053
02:09:13.96 --> 02:09:16.96
We think our judgment is bad because we put our faith in this person who hurt us.

2054
02:09:16.96 --> 02:09:19.96
So how do you build that trust back with yourself?

2055
02:09:19.96 --> 02:09:21.96
Look back and learn from the relationship.

2056
02:09:21.96 --> 02:09:26.96
See the mistakes you made and the red flags you missed, then look for them next time around.

2057
02:09:26.96 --> 02:09:31.96
Recognize that there are plenty of people out there in the world that are trust worthy and faithful.

2058
02:09:31.96 --> 02:09:33.96
Go find one of them.

2059
02:09:33.96 --> 02:09:36.96
Move forward in that relationship with a clean slate.

2060
02:09:36.96 --> 02:09:37.96
Don't bring baggage.

2061
02:09:37.96 --> 02:09:39.96
So there's your protocol.

2062
02:09:39.96 --> 02:09:43.96
And I think the humorous protocol, the original protocol was like,

2063
02:09:43.96 --> 02:09:46.96
Order Pete. I made something up off the top of my head.

2064
02:09:46.96 --> 02:09:49.96
This is the legit protocol.

2065
02:09:49.96 --> 02:09:54.96
And man, if you can execute this, it's hard to execute because people get all wrapped around.

2066
02:09:54.96 --> 02:09:56.96
They get wrapped around this thing.

2067
02:09:56.96 --> 02:09:59.96
So deep and so hard.

2068
02:09:59.96 --> 02:10:02.96
So, but it's a protocol.

2069
02:10:02.96 --> 02:10:03.96
It's a protocol.

2070
02:10:03.96 --> 02:10:05.96
It's a way to handle these things.

2071
02:10:05.96 --> 02:10:08.96
We got a way in here to handle death.

2072
02:10:08.96 --> 02:10:10.96
A protocol for death.

2073
02:10:10.96 --> 02:10:13.96
What do you do when someone dies?

2074
02:10:13.96 --> 02:10:14.96
Here's the protocol.

2075
02:10:14.96 --> 02:10:16.96
What do you do when you have some kind of financial problems?

2076
02:10:16.96 --> 02:10:17.96
What's the protocol?

2077
02:10:17.96 --> 02:10:18.96
What do you do?

2078
02:10:18.96 --> 02:10:20.96
How do you handle it?

2079
02:10:20.96 --> 02:10:23.96
What do you do when you have a betrayal of trust?

2080
02:10:23.96 --> 02:10:23.96
Right?

2081
02:10:23.96 --> 02:10:29.96
Because it's not always in a relationship like a spouse or a girl, an intimate relationship that you have a bit trail of trust.

2082
02:10:29.96 --> 02:10:31.96
Sometimes it can happen in a work environment.

2083
02:10:31.96 --> 02:10:35.96
Sometimes it can happen just with friends.

2084
02:10:35.96 --> 02:10:36.96
So betrayal of trust?

2085
02:10:36.96 --> 02:10:37.96
What do you do then?

2086
02:10:37.96 --> 02:10:38.96
How do you handle it?

2087
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:39.96
What's the protocol?

2088
02:10:39.96 --> 02:10:40.96
We got problems going on at work.

2089
02:10:40.96 --> 02:10:41.96
What's the protocol?

2090
02:10:41.96 --> 02:10:45.96
How do I handle it?

2091
02:10:45.96 --> 02:10:49.96
What if I said or did something that hurt someone's feeling and I need to make it right?

2092
02:10:49.96 --> 02:10:51.96
In other words, what if I need to make an apology?

2093
02:10:51.96 --> 02:10:53.96
What's the protocol to apologize?

2094
02:10:53.96 --> 02:10:54.96
How do we do it?

2095
02:10:54.96 --> 02:10:55.96
Some people go through their lives.

2096
02:10:55.96 --> 02:10:59.96
They do not apologize.

2097
02:10:59.96 --> 02:11:03.96
How do I do when there's an accident or there's an illness?

2098
02:11:03.96 --> 02:11:06.96
Like severe medical diagnosis?

2099
02:11:06.96 --> 02:11:07.96
What do I do?

2100
02:11:07.96 --> 02:11:09.96
How do I handle it?

2101
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:11.96
What's the protocol?

2102
02:11:11.96 --> 02:11:15.96
What's the protocol for addiction?

2103
02:11:15.96 --> 02:11:16.96
What do I do?

2104
02:11:16.96 --> 02:11:21.96
How do we handle this?

2105
02:11:21.96 --> 02:11:23.96
What's the protocol for trauma?

2106
02:11:23.96 --> 02:11:25.96
I suffered a psychological trauma.

2107
02:11:25.96 --> 02:11:27.96
I don't know how to deal with it.

2108
02:11:27.96 --> 02:11:28.96
What do I do then?

2109
02:11:28.96 --> 02:11:34.96
And again, look, these topics of trauma, these topics of addiction.

2110
02:11:34.96 --> 02:11:37.96
Look, that's why we say you might need to get professional help.

2111
02:11:37.96 --> 02:11:39.96
In fact, you should.

2112
02:11:39.96 --> 02:11:42.96
But even when you get professional help, you're going to see these protocols.

2113
02:11:42.96 --> 02:11:45.96
Protocols to follow.

2114
02:11:45.96 --> 02:11:47.96
And then there's this last one, the unknown.

2115
02:11:47.96 --> 02:11:51.96
What do I do when I don't know what to do?

2116
02:11:51.96 --> 02:11:52.96
Something bad happened.

2117
02:11:52.96 --> 02:11:54.96
I don't even know where to start.

2118
02:11:54.96 --> 02:11:55.96
I'll go through this.

2119
02:11:55.96 --> 02:11:57.96
This is the strategy protocol.

2120
02:11:57.96 --> 02:12:00.96
Every scenario cannot be addressed.

2121
02:12:00.96 --> 02:12:03.96
So this is the protocol for what to do when you don't know what to do.

2122
02:12:03.96 --> 02:12:07.96
Start by taking a step back to attach, take a breath and look around.

2123
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:10.96
Make sure you assess everything that is happening.

2124
02:12:10.96 --> 02:12:12.96
Two, think about your possibility.

2125
02:12:12.96 --> 02:12:17.96
Think about what your possibilities are and what decisions you could make right now.

2126
02:12:17.96 --> 02:12:21.96
And what are the likely outcomes of those decisions?

2127
02:12:21.96 --> 02:12:23.96
Three, write it down.

2128
02:12:23.96 --> 02:12:25.96
What does success look like in this situation?

2129
02:12:25.96 --> 02:12:26.96
How can you get there?

2130
02:12:26.96 --> 02:12:27.96
How long should it take?

2131
02:12:27.96 --> 02:12:30.96
Do you know anyone can provide guidance or advice?

2132
02:12:30.96 --> 02:12:32.96
Four, work the plan.

2133
02:12:32.96 --> 02:12:35.96
Take action that moves you forward.

2134
02:12:35.96 --> 02:12:36.96
Don't stay stagnant.

2135
02:12:36.96 --> 02:12:37.96
Don't dwell.

2136
02:12:37.96 --> 02:12:41.96
Take a small step towards what you think is the best decision.

2137
02:12:41.96 --> 02:12:44.96
Not a giant step because you don't know exactly what is going on.

2138
02:12:44.96 --> 02:12:49.96
This is a step that allows you to assess again before you decide on what to do next.

2139
02:12:49.96 --> 02:12:52.96
Five, push forward and then pause and reassess again.

2140
02:12:52.96 --> 02:12:55.96
Repeat and press forward to the point of friction.

2141
02:12:55.96 --> 02:13:01.96
Press until you reach the point that you see a new opportunity or need to pull back and reassess again.

2142
02:13:01.96 --> 02:13:05.96
Six, allow yourself room to maneuver.

2143
02:13:05.96 --> 02:13:09.96
When it gets hard, don't surrender, don't give up, don't quit.

2144
02:13:09.96 --> 02:13:11.96
Then you haven't failed.

2145
02:13:11.96 --> 02:13:14.96
All it means you need to regroup and reattach.

2146
02:13:14.96 --> 02:13:15.96
You've learned.

2147
02:13:15.96 --> 02:13:19.96
You've gained experience and you're still alive.

2148
02:13:19.96 --> 02:13:26.96
There's going to be things in life that you don't expect.

2149
02:13:26.96 --> 02:13:28.96
And you don't know what to do.

2150
02:13:28.96 --> 02:13:29.96
And there's the protocol.

2151
02:13:29.96 --> 02:13:33.96
The beauty of the protocols and we were writing them.

2152
02:13:33.96 --> 02:13:39.96
It can expect at the very beginning is that even with death and illness, you are in control.

2153
02:13:39.96 --> 02:13:40.96
Maybe not everything.

2154
02:13:40.96 --> 02:13:42.96
Maybe you're not a control of everything.

2155
02:13:42.96 --> 02:13:46.96
But you have so much more control than you might give yourself credit for.

2156
02:13:46.96 --> 02:13:48.96
And you have to take control of that situation.

2157
02:13:48.96 --> 02:13:51.96
You are in control of how you react and how you respond.

2158
02:13:51.96 --> 02:13:54.96
And running through those protocols is you being in control.

2159
02:13:54.96 --> 02:13:56.96
And you talk about, hey, that's hard.

2160
02:13:56.96 --> 02:14:00.96
Walk in away from the girl, the one you know is the right one for you.

2161
02:14:00.96 --> 02:14:02.96
But it turns out they're not.

2162
02:14:02.96 --> 02:14:04.96
That's hard.

2163
02:14:04.96 --> 02:14:10.96
But if you can do that, if you can control that situation, think of how much more in your life you can control.

2164
02:14:10.96 --> 02:14:14.96
And that's what those protocols are about as you being in control of these situations.

2165
02:14:14.96 --> 02:14:15.96
It is much as you can.

2166
02:14:15.96 --> 02:14:20.96
Yeah, and we've all said that it's actually on front to a bunch of our clients.

2167
02:14:20.96 --> 02:14:21.96
What do we do now?

2168
02:14:21.96 --> 02:14:22.96
What do we do with COVID-19?

2169
02:14:22.96 --> 02:14:23.96
We can't control this.

2170
02:14:23.96 --> 02:14:24.96
We control how we respond.

2171
02:14:24.96 --> 02:14:26.96
That's what we control.

2172
02:14:26.96 --> 02:14:28.96
And you absolutely control how you respond.

2173
02:14:28.96 --> 02:14:32.96
The book wraps up.

2174
02:14:32.96 --> 02:14:34.96
You're on the path.

2175
02:14:34.96 --> 02:14:38.96
You're seeing the results of your hard work and your efforts are paying off unmitigated daily discipline.

2176
02:14:38.96 --> 02:14:41.96
And all things is not just to saying it's your life.

2177
02:14:41.96 --> 02:14:42.96
Your health is excellent.

2178
02:14:42.96 --> 02:14:45.96
Your work and personal performance is exceeding expectations.

2179
02:14:45.96 --> 02:14:48.96
You are leading in all aspects of your life.

2180
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:50.96
So what now?

2181
02:14:50.96 --> 02:14:59.96
Think those who helped you along the way, take stock and what you have achieved, then go harder.

2182
02:14:59.96 --> 02:15:02.96
Lead.

2183
02:15:02.96 --> 02:15:06.96
Lead your family, your community, your country, lead everyone in everything in your world.

2184
02:15:06.96 --> 02:15:08.96
Lead others to the path.

2185
02:15:08.96 --> 02:15:11.96
Show them the way.

2186
02:15:11.96 --> 02:15:13.96
And you called me out on that.

2187
02:15:13.96 --> 02:15:16.96
You said, Dave, there's one nice road.

2188
02:15:16.96 --> 02:15:17.96
It's so good.

2189
02:15:17.96 --> 02:15:19.96
And you said, go harder.

2190
02:15:19.96 --> 02:15:22.96
I was like, yes, I like it.

2191
02:15:22.96 --> 02:15:24.96
And then it closes out unmitigated,

2192
02:15:24.96 --> 02:15:26.96
dis-dale discipline in all things.

2193
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:27.96
It's the only way.

2194
02:15:27.96 --> 02:15:38.96
We've got downloadable evaluation forms at jockelpublishing.com slash downloads.

2195
02:15:38.96 --> 02:15:44.96
So you can take those forms and you can start filling them out for yourself.

2196
02:15:44.96 --> 02:15:47.96
And there you go.

2197
02:15:47.96 --> 02:15:52.96
So I'm 174, podcast 174.

2198
02:15:52.96 --> 02:15:55.96
I said to think about where you're at.

2199
02:15:55.96 --> 02:15:59.96
Are you really a five?

2200
02:15:59.96 --> 02:16:00.96
Really?

2201
02:16:00.96 --> 02:16:02.96
Or are you a two?

2202
02:16:02.96 --> 02:16:05.96
Can you aim for a three or a four?

2203
02:16:05.96 --> 02:16:09.96
Is there any quality that you can reach five on?

2204
02:16:09.96 --> 02:16:11.96
Good question.

2205
02:16:11.96 --> 02:16:13.96
Let's try.

2206
02:16:13.96 --> 02:16:16.96
Let's try because we might not be able to reach five,

2207
02:16:16.96 --> 02:16:19.96
but we can absolutely get better.

2208
02:16:19.96 --> 02:16:27.96
We can absolutely continue to pursue the quest that never is going to end.

2209
02:16:27.96 --> 02:16:32.96
Trying to become an eminently qualified human being.

2210
02:16:32.96 --> 02:16:36.96
And if you live that way,

2211
02:16:36.96 --> 02:16:41.96
if you live trying to become an eminently qualified human being,

2212
02:16:41.96 --> 02:16:48.96
what you'll end up doing is living an eminently honorable wife.

2213
02:16:48.96 --> 02:16:55.96
And a life eminently worth living.

2214
02:16:55.96 --> 02:17:01.96
There you go.

2215
02:17:01.96 --> 02:17:05.96
Anything else, Dave?

2216
02:17:05.96 --> 02:17:08.96
Negative.

2217
02:17:08.96 --> 02:17:11.96
Well, echo Charles, you know what that means?

2218
02:17:11.96 --> 02:17:12.96
Yes.

2219
02:17:12.96 --> 02:17:16.96
Since it looks like we are attempting to head down the path.

2220
02:17:16.96 --> 02:17:23.96
What he got, what recommendations do you have that can help us,

2221
02:17:23.96 --> 02:17:26.96
you know, proceed shall we say?

2222
02:17:26.96 --> 02:17:28.96
I've got a few.

2223
02:17:28.96 --> 02:17:32.96
So first thing, as always, is due to you,

2224
02:17:32.96 --> 02:17:35.96
although at this current exact moment in time,

2225
02:17:35.96 --> 02:17:37.96
we're doing a lot less if any.

2226
02:17:37.96 --> 02:17:41.96
Because we have to stay safe because that's part of it too.

2227
02:17:41.96 --> 02:17:42.96
You've got to stay safe.

2228
02:17:42.96 --> 02:17:45.96
You've got to probably one of the things this whole thing is about.

2229
02:17:45.96 --> 02:17:47.96
We have to stay safe.

2230
02:17:47.96 --> 02:17:50.96
Yeah, we're prepared to do just something else.

2231
02:17:50.96 --> 02:17:53.96
Less, this is how we're going to do it.

2232
02:17:53.96 --> 02:17:57.96
All these things I'm about to say right now are all included in the path.

2233
02:17:57.96 --> 02:17:59.96
Like their path, what do you say?

2234
02:17:59.96 --> 02:18:01.96
Like where the, or inclusive.

2235
02:18:01.96 --> 02:18:04.96
Whatever path, where the end path inclusive.

2236
02:18:04.96 --> 02:18:05.96
Yeah.

2237
02:18:05.96 --> 02:18:07.96
You say both. And pick your, pick your pronoun.

2238
02:18:07.96 --> 02:18:08.96
Yes.

2239
02:18:08.96 --> 02:18:09.96
No, that's not a pronoun.

2240
02:18:09.96 --> 02:18:10.96
You can pick your word.

2241
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:11.96
Pick your verbage.

2242
02:18:11.96 --> 02:18:13.96
Yes.

2243
02:18:13.96 --> 02:18:16.96
So, due to when we can, part of it for sure.

2244
02:18:16.96 --> 02:18:18.96
You say martial arts.

2245
02:18:18.96 --> 02:18:21.96
I feel like you were like fighting your pan back.

2246
02:18:21.96 --> 02:18:22.96
Because you just want to write due to you,

2247
02:18:22.96 --> 02:18:24.96
but you just got to go martial arts.

2248
02:18:24.96 --> 02:18:27.96
No, that's not necessarily actually, that's not true.

2249
02:18:27.96 --> 02:18:28.96
Okay.

2250
02:18:28.96 --> 02:18:31.96
Because due to you is definitely really good.

2251
02:18:31.96 --> 02:18:32.96
But you got to learn that.

2252
02:18:32.96 --> 02:18:34.96
Boxing that boy tying that wrestling.

2253
02:18:34.96 --> 02:18:39.96
You can't get five by just limiting yourself to just,

2254
02:18:39.96 --> 02:18:42.96
just, just straight out totally and being rigid to it.

2255
02:18:42.96 --> 02:18:43.96
Yeah.

2256
02:18:43.96 --> 02:18:44.96
You got to do it anymore.

2257
02:18:44.96 --> 02:18:45.96
Just sure.

2258
02:18:45.96 --> 02:18:46.96
All right.

2259
02:18:46.96 --> 02:18:47.96
Well, but we are doing jiu-jitsu.

2260
02:18:47.96 --> 02:18:48.96
Yes, sir, big time.

2261
02:18:48.96 --> 02:18:50.96
It includes jiu-jitsu.

2262
02:18:50.96 --> 02:18:51.96
Include it, but not limited to.

2263
02:18:51.96 --> 02:18:52.96
We'll see that in the moment.

2264
02:18:52.96 --> 02:18:53.96
All right.

2265
02:18:53.96 --> 02:18:55.96
So, when you do, when you do jiu-jitsu, you need a key.

2266
02:18:55.96 --> 02:18:57.96
Anourage card, because these are the uniform.

2267
02:18:57.96 --> 02:19:00.96
So, get the best key.

2268
02:19:00.96 --> 02:19:02.96
Best for Ashcard from origin.

2269
02:19:02.96 --> 02:19:04.96
Originmade.com, where you can get all this stuff.

2270
02:19:04.96 --> 02:19:06.96
So, he's, Rushcards.

2271
02:19:06.96 --> 02:19:09.96
A bunch of other cool stuff on there.

2272
02:19:09.96 --> 02:19:10.96
Also jeans.

2273
02:19:10.96 --> 02:19:11.96
Mm-hmm.

2274
02:19:11.96 --> 02:19:16.96
So, getting origin made jeans.

2275
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:21.96
American-made denim does improve the community around you.

2276
02:19:21.96 --> 02:19:23.96
That is a good, very valid point.

2277
02:19:23.96 --> 02:19:24.96
Yes.

2278
02:19:24.96 --> 02:19:25.96
Very valid point.

2279
02:19:25.96 --> 02:19:31.96
And right now, it is April 21st, 2020.

2280
02:19:31.96 --> 02:19:36.96
And there's a pandemic going on.

2281
02:19:36.96 --> 02:19:41.96
We at origin, the origin team, has shifted to making face coverings.

2282
02:19:41.96 --> 02:19:43.96
Is what they're officially called?

2283
02:19:43.96 --> 02:19:49.96
Because we don't want to imply that they have the medical qualities that an N95 mask has on,

2284
02:19:49.96 --> 02:19:55.96
but the government has recommended and medical professionals have recommended that people

2285
02:19:55.96 --> 02:19:56.96
wear face coverings.

2286
02:19:56.96 --> 02:20:00.96
So, we are making a massive amount of face coverings right now.

2287
02:20:00.96 --> 02:20:08.96
So, people that have ordered jeans, we actually shut down those lines right now.

2288
02:20:08.96 --> 02:20:11.96
But we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

2289
02:20:11.96 --> 02:20:15.96
And we are ready to open the jeans line back up, the gelines back up,

2290
02:20:15.96 --> 02:20:18.96
and we'll be doing that shortly.

2291
02:20:18.96 --> 02:20:22.96
So, just check originmade.com if you want to pair jeans.

2292
02:20:22.96 --> 02:20:25.96
If you want to pair boots, we're there.

2293
02:20:25.96 --> 02:20:26.96
We're making them.

2294
02:20:26.96 --> 02:20:32.96
We're going to do a little adjustment because of the demands of this pandemic put on America.

2295
02:20:32.96 --> 02:20:34.96
So, it made some adjustments.

2296
02:20:34.96 --> 02:20:40.96
But in the end, we're going to make American products.

2297
02:20:40.96 --> 02:20:43.96
We're going to make American made jeans, gays,

2298
02:20:43.96 --> 02:20:46.96
rash cards, t-shirts, thumb on your heads.

2299
02:20:46.96 --> 02:20:55.96
So, I appreciate everyone's patience as we try and support America through this pandemic scenario.

2300
02:20:55.96 --> 02:20:59.96
Also supplementation.

2301
02:20:59.96 --> 02:21:02.96
Keep you on the path, keep you in the game.

2302
02:21:02.96 --> 02:21:03.96
Big time.

2303
02:21:03.96 --> 02:21:04.96
So, what have we got?

2304
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:06.96
Mulk, additional protein,

2305
02:21:06.96 --> 02:21:09.96
and some of the dessert, by the way.

2306
02:21:09.96 --> 02:21:12.96
Discipline and discipline go.

2307
02:21:12.96 --> 02:21:16.96
Essentially the same thing in different what delivery method.

2308
02:21:16.96 --> 02:21:17.96
Yeah.

2309
02:21:17.96 --> 02:21:18.96
Yeah.

2310
02:21:18.96 --> 02:21:21.96
It is essentially the same thing in different delivery methods.

2311
02:21:21.96 --> 02:21:22.96
That's for your brain.

2312
02:21:22.96 --> 02:21:23.96
Yeah.

2313
02:21:23.96 --> 02:21:26.96
Discipline, discipline go RTD.

2314
02:21:26.96 --> 02:21:28.96
Ready to drink.

2315
02:21:28.96 --> 02:21:33.96
Is that a term from that industry?

2316
02:21:33.96 --> 02:21:34.96
Right?

2317
02:21:34.96 --> 02:21:36.96
Like you wouldn't say hey, can you grab an RTD?

2318
02:21:36.96 --> 02:21:38.96
No, you'd say grab me a can of go.

2319
02:21:38.96 --> 02:21:39.96
Yeah.

2320
02:21:39.96 --> 02:21:40.96
So, yeah.

2321
02:21:40.96 --> 02:21:43.96
But in the industry, which I had to learn about,

2322
02:21:43.96 --> 02:21:45.96
it's called RTD.

2323
02:21:45.96 --> 02:21:46.96
Ready to drink.

2324
02:21:46.96 --> 02:21:48.96
Crack it open and drink it.

2325
02:21:48.96 --> 02:21:49.96
So, yeah, we got all that.

2326
02:21:49.96 --> 02:21:52.96
We got Mulk, Warrior Kid Mulk.

2327
02:21:52.96 --> 02:21:53.96
We got Jockel White T.

2328
02:21:53.96 --> 02:21:56.96
And by the way, all these products, you can get them all mine at originmain.com.

2329
02:21:56.96 --> 02:21:57.96
Or you can go to Vitaminshop.

2330
02:21:57.96 --> 02:22:00.96
If you go to a Vitaminshop in your AO.

2331
02:22:00.96 --> 02:22:01.96
You can get some.

2332
02:22:01.96 --> 02:22:06.96
What's your, what's your, your biggest, you, you look like you want to say something about.

2333
02:22:06.96 --> 02:22:07.96
Yeah.

2334
02:22:07.96 --> 02:22:09.96
So, I'm on the Mulk channel.

2335
02:22:09.96 --> 02:22:12.96
Everybody knows that I would like to think that.

2336
02:22:12.96 --> 02:22:15.96
I'm well-associated with discipline go.

2337
02:22:15.96 --> 02:22:18.96
And I thought was, we last time we said I thought it was ready to deploy cans.

2338
02:22:18.96 --> 02:22:19.96
Because I grab them and then I go with them.

2339
02:22:19.96 --> 02:22:20.96
Oh, it's back.

2340
02:22:20.96 --> 02:22:22.96
But I'm on another train right now.

2341
02:22:22.96 --> 02:22:24.96
I don't know if I'm supposed to be announcing this train.

2342
02:22:24.96 --> 02:22:26.96
But I'm on the Cold War train.

2343
02:22:26.96 --> 02:22:27.96
Oh, yeah.

2344
02:22:27.96 --> 02:22:33.96
So, that cannot go unstated that the, that supplement, the Cold War supplement right now.

2345
02:22:33.96 --> 02:22:34.96
Yeah.

2346
02:22:34.96 --> 02:22:39.96
I would say a requirement right now and something that is part of my current repertoire.

2347
02:22:39.96 --> 02:22:40.96
Yeah.

2348
02:22:40.96 --> 02:22:43.96
Well, especially, you know, a month ago, we were traveling all the time.

2349
02:22:43.96 --> 02:22:46.96
And I was, but I was at Ground Zero.

2350
02:22:46.96 --> 02:22:47.96
Yeah.

2351
02:22:47.96 --> 02:22:51.96
So, I did a gig in San Francisco, Seattle, New York,

2352
02:22:51.96 --> 02:22:56.96
like the three first kind of areas where the pandemic broke out.

2353
02:22:56.96 --> 02:22:59.96
But, you know, also in everyone of those places,

2354
02:22:59.96 --> 02:23:03.96
shaking between 1,000 and 2,000 people's hands.

2355
02:23:03.96 --> 02:23:04.96
Totally.

2356
02:23:04.96 --> 02:23:08.96
In each one of those places, traveling on an airplane with a bunch of other people

2357
02:23:08.96 --> 02:23:09.96
in between those places.

2358
02:23:09.96 --> 02:23:13.96
So, yeah, you've got to have that immune system engaged.

2359
02:23:13.96 --> 02:23:15.96
Yeah, you're cold war on.

2360
02:23:15.96 --> 02:23:16.96
Yeah.

2361
02:23:16.96 --> 02:23:19.96
I feel like Cold War is more of a tank than a train.

2362
02:23:19.96 --> 02:23:21.96
I'm sure I'm saying.

2363
02:23:21.96 --> 02:23:22.96
I do.

2364
02:23:22.96 --> 02:23:24.96
Because, yeah, I look like a detective armor.

2365
02:23:24.96 --> 02:23:27.96
Yeah, so maybe tank could be there.

2366
02:23:27.96 --> 02:23:32.96
Does Cold War tank, does that even sound like a thing, though?

2367
02:23:32.96 --> 02:23:35.96
Because, Mol train sounds like a thing.

2368
02:23:35.96 --> 02:23:36.96
Yeah.

2369
02:23:36.96 --> 02:23:38.96
And D plane kind of sounds like something, too.

2370
02:23:38.96 --> 02:23:39.96
But, D plane all the time.

2371
02:23:39.96 --> 02:23:42.96
It used to sound like something you tried to implement.

2372
02:23:42.96 --> 02:23:43.96
Oh, it's implemented.

2373
02:23:43.96 --> 02:23:44.96
Put it that way, indeed.

2374
02:23:44.96 --> 02:23:45.96
All right.

2375
02:23:45.96 --> 02:23:46.96
And the last, all right.

2376
02:23:46.96 --> 02:23:47.96
Cool.

2377
02:23:47.96 --> 02:23:48.96
Yes.

2378
02:23:48.96 --> 02:23:50.96
These are all things approved by the path.

2379
02:23:50.96 --> 02:23:51.96
100%.

2380
02:23:51.96 --> 02:23:52.96
100%.

2381
02:23:52.96 --> 02:23:53.96
Really?

2382
02:23:53.96 --> 02:23:54.96
Let's face it.

2383
02:23:54.96 --> 02:23:56.96
Also, we have a store.

2384
02:23:56.96 --> 02:23:58.96
It's called Jocco Store.

2385
02:23:58.96 --> 02:24:02.96
So, where you can get items to represent while you're on the path.

2386
02:24:02.96 --> 02:24:06.96
In quarantine or not, I'm saying that's time goes on.

2387
02:24:06.96 --> 02:24:07.96
You said I'm saying anyway.

2388
02:24:07.96 --> 02:24:09.96
We got shirts on there.

2389
02:24:09.96 --> 02:24:10.96
Hoodies.

2390
02:24:10.96 --> 02:24:12.96
More rashguards.

2391
02:24:12.96 --> 02:24:13.96
They go free.

2392
02:24:13.96 --> 02:24:14.96
All these good stuff.

2393
02:24:14.96 --> 02:24:15.96
Hoodies.

2394
02:24:15.96 --> 02:24:16.96
Tracers hats.

2395
02:24:16.96 --> 02:24:17.96
Beans.

2396
02:24:17.96 --> 02:24:18.96
Flex it.

2397
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:19.96
All that stuff.

2398
02:24:19.96 --> 02:24:20.96
The boxes.

2399
02:24:20.96 --> 02:24:22.96
We've got about the boxes.

2400
02:24:22.96 --> 02:24:23.96
The boxes are.

2401
02:24:23.96 --> 02:24:27.96
We've put together a bunch of boxes for the live gigs.

2402
02:24:27.96 --> 02:24:28.96
I was doing the live gigs.

2403
02:24:28.96 --> 02:24:29.96
Got canceled.

2404
02:24:29.96 --> 02:24:30.96
So, we got a bunch of these boxes.

2405
02:24:30.96 --> 02:24:31.96
We just reassemble.

2406
02:24:31.96 --> 02:24:33.96
I put some of them up there.

2407
02:24:33.96 --> 02:24:34.96
And they sold out.

2408
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:36.96
So, we just assembled some more of them.

2409
02:24:36.96 --> 02:24:39.96
So, if you want to get those boxes, there's a warrior kid box.

2410
02:24:39.96 --> 02:24:43.96
And there's a deaf core box.

2411
02:24:43.96 --> 02:24:45.96
They're like, um, they have the flags.

2412
02:24:45.96 --> 02:24:48.96
You're going to warrior kid flagging to just pre-close freedom flag in there.

2413
02:24:48.96 --> 02:24:50.96
Then they got a bunch of other cool things.

2414
02:24:50.96 --> 02:24:52.96
It's like a little tool kit for the path.

2415
02:24:52.96 --> 02:24:53.96
That's what it is.

2416
02:24:53.96 --> 02:24:54.96
Yeah, that's what it is.

2417
02:24:54.96 --> 02:24:55.96
I like what I got mine.

2418
02:24:55.96 --> 02:24:56.96
I like where you're at.

2419
02:24:56.96 --> 02:24:57.96
Yes, sure.

2420
02:24:57.96 --> 02:24:58.96
Oh, yes.

2421
02:24:58.96 --> 02:25:01.96
We have those all on jocostor.com.

2422
02:25:01.96 --> 02:25:04.96
Also, subscribe to this podcast if you haven't already.

2423
02:25:04.96 --> 02:25:07.96
Because it's important in many ways.

2424
02:25:07.96 --> 02:25:09.96
Um, arguably.

2425
02:25:09.96 --> 02:25:10.96
Yeah, real, arguably.

2426
02:25:10.96 --> 02:25:11.96
And I'll tell you what.

2427
02:25:11.96 --> 02:25:15.96
If you're two hours in whatever many minutes deep into this thing, you haven't subscribed.

2428
02:25:15.96 --> 02:25:17.96
Well, I don't know.

2429
02:25:17.96 --> 02:25:18.96
I don't know.

2430
02:25:18.96 --> 02:25:20.96
I don't know if they don't want to stick to you as a person.

2431
02:25:20.96 --> 02:25:21.96
We got some other podcast.

2432
02:25:21.96 --> 02:25:25.96
We got the thread, which is with Darrell Cooper, Margar Made.

2433
02:25:25.96 --> 02:25:27.96
So, you can check that one out.

2434
02:25:27.96 --> 02:25:31.96
We got grounded podcast, which is a podcast about you to do it.

2435
02:25:31.96 --> 02:25:33.96
The thread is about.

2436
02:25:33.96 --> 02:25:42.96
The thread is about the threads between history and the past and how they tie into what's happening right now in the world.

2437
02:25:42.96 --> 02:25:44.96
So, that's been cool.

2438
02:25:44.96 --> 02:25:47.96
The warrior kid podcast.

2439
02:25:47.96 --> 02:25:48.96
For the warrior kids.

2440
02:25:48.96 --> 02:25:50.96
And then we also from the warrior kid podcast.

2441
02:25:50.96 --> 02:25:54.96
We got some warrior kids soap, young Aiden Irish Oaks Ranch.com.

2442
02:25:54.96 --> 02:25:56.96
He's making soap.

2443
02:25:56.96 --> 02:25:58.96
He's making killer soap.

2444
02:25:58.96 --> 02:25:59.96
That's the name of the soap.

2445
02:25:59.96 --> 02:26:00.96
Oh, yeah.

2446
02:26:00.96 --> 02:26:02.96
And if you get that kind of soap, it will definitely give you the

2447
02:26:02.96 --> 02:26:04.96
capability to...

2448
02:26:04.96 --> 02:26:06.96
Stay clean.

2449
02:26:06.96 --> 02:26:06.96
Yeah.

2450
02:26:06.96 --> 02:26:08.96
Which is part of the path too, by the way.

2451
02:26:08.96 --> 02:26:09.96
Don't be all dirty.

2452
02:26:09.96 --> 02:26:10.96
Yeah.

2453
02:26:10.96 --> 02:26:13.96
I guess you've got to be willing to get dirty, but not stay dirty.

2454
02:26:13.96 --> 02:26:14.96
You're gonna stay clean.

2455
02:26:14.96 --> 02:26:24.96
That's what you're gonna stay, but with varying levels of capability to endure dirt.

2456
02:26:24.96 --> 02:26:25.96
In terms.

2457
02:26:25.96 --> 02:26:26.96
Okay.

2458
02:26:26.96 --> 02:26:28.96
I'm trying to put it into context here.

2459
02:26:28.96 --> 02:26:30.96
Anyway, also we have YouTube channel.

2460
02:26:30.96 --> 02:26:35.96
For video version of this podcast and other in excerpts as well.

2461
02:26:35.96 --> 02:26:39.96
This turns out to be a cool way, I think, to lead to the podcast.

2462
02:26:39.96 --> 02:26:41.96
Be more immersed in the conversation.

2463
02:26:41.96 --> 02:26:42.96
I think.

2464
02:26:42.96 --> 02:26:43.96
You can see what good deal Dave looks like.

2465
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:44.96
Yeah, man.

2466
02:26:44.96 --> 02:26:45.96
Can't.

2467
02:26:45.96 --> 02:26:47.96
Good looking guy at the end of the day for sure.

2468
02:26:47.96 --> 02:26:50.96
So yeah, YouTube channel, jockelp podcast.

Checkmark.

2471
02:26:52.96 --> 02:26:53.96
You know the checkmark thing.

2472
02:26:53.96 --> 02:26:56.96
Even if it's just so that you can recognize the real one from the impossible.

2473
02:26:56.96 --> 02:26:57.96
It's not just one.

2474
02:26:57.96 --> 02:26:58.96
Yeah.

2475
02:26:58.96 --> 02:26:59.96
It's not.

2476
02:26:59.96 --> 02:27:00.96

02:27:00.96 --> 02:27:03.96

2478
02:27:03.96 --> 02:27:04.96
Sure.

2479
02:27:04.96 --> 02:27:05.96
Yeah.

2480
02:27:05.96 --> 02:27:08.96
And we also have psychological warfare.

2481
02:27:08.96 --> 02:27:10.96
iTunes, Google Play and MP3 platforms.

2482
02:27:10.96 --> 02:27:14.96
If you want to check that out, we have flip side canvas to code a Meyer, making cool things

2483
02:27:14.96 --> 02:27:16.96
to hang on your wall that will keep you on the path.

2484
02:27:16.96 --> 02:27:17.96
Got a bunch of books.

2485
02:27:17.96 --> 02:27:20.96
Leadership strategy and tactics field manual.

2486
02:27:20.96 --> 02:27:23.96
Dave Berkley with the one of the first people to read that.

2487
02:27:23.96 --> 02:27:25.96
You might have even been the first person to read that.

2488
02:27:25.96 --> 02:27:27.96
So you get some credit there.

2489
02:27:27.96 --> 02:27:28.96
I appreciate that.

2490
02:27:28.96 --> 02:27:31.96
That book that should be an RTD field manual ready to deploy.

2491
02:27:31.96 --> 02:27:34.96
That thing needs to be not the ready anytime.

2492
02:27:34.96 --> 02:27:37.96
Immediately reference any issue you got.

2493
02:27:37.96 --> 02:27:38.96
That thing stays with you.

2494
02:27:38.96 --> 02:27:39.96
It does not go in the shelf.

2495
02:27:39.96 --> 02:27:40.96
I think it's ready to deploy.

2496
02:27:40.96 --> 02:27:41.96
Yeah.

2497
02:27:41.96 --> 02:27:42.96
That's I like it.

2498
02:27:42.96 --> 02:27:45.96
It's just about everything I get asked.

2499
02:27:45.96 --> 02:27:47.96
I can answer it in that book.

2500
02:27:47.96 --> 02:27:48.96
Bro.

2501
02:27:48.96 --> 02:27:49.96
So pretty straightforward.

2502
02:27:49.96 --> 02:27:51.96
Also got way the warrior kid.

2503
02:27:51.96 --> 02:27:54.96
One, two and three.

2504
02:27:54.96 --> 02:27:56.96
Are your kids still reading that book?

2505
02:27:56.96 --> 02:27:57.96
They are reading that book.

2506
02:27:57.96 --> 02:27:58.96
Read it.

2507
02:27:58.96 --> 02:27:59.96
Number three.

2508
02:27:59.96 --> 02:28:00.96
Finish number three last night.

2509
02:28:00.96 --> 02:28:02.96
Last chapter with Matt last night.

2510
02:28:02.96 --> 02:28:03.96
Didn't want to go.

2511
02:28:03.96 --> 02:28:04.96
Was that his first time getting through it?

2512
02:28:04.96 --> 02:28:05.96
No.

2513
02:28:05.96 --> 02:28:06.96
Negative.

2514
02:28:06.96 --> 02:28:07.96
Negative.

2515
02:28:07.96 --> 02:28:08.96
Negative.

2516
02:28:08.96 --> 02:28:12.96
But they're ready for for their super pump because you had some new warrior kid podcast.

2517
02:28:12.96 --> 02:28:13.96
Come out.

2518
02:28:13.96 --> 02:28:14.96
Oh, yeah.

2519
02:28:14.96 --> 02:28:15.96
They're still about that.

2520
02:28:15.96 --> 02:28:16.96
Yeah.

2521
02:28:16.96 --> 02:28:17.96
Johnny Kim was on one.

2522
02:28:17.96 --> 02:28:18.96
Yes.

2523
02:28:18.96 --> 02:28:19.96
Because who doesn't what kids not.

2524
02:28:19.96 --> 02:28:21.96
What kids not saying I want to be.

2525
02:28:21.96 --> 02:28:24.96
Just a Navy seal a doctor and an astronaut.

2526
02:28:24.96 --> 02:28:25.96
Whatever.

2527
02:28:25.96 --> 02:28:28.96
Like every kid.

2528
02:28:28.96 --> 02:28:29.96
What else could he add on there?

2529
02:28:29.96 --> 02:28:31.96
I guess he needs to be a fireman.

2530
02:28:31.96 --> 02:28:32.96
Firefighter.

2531
02:28:32.96 --> 02:28:33.96
Firefighter.

2532
02:28:33.96 --> 02:28:35.96
What else?

2533
02:28:35.96 --> 02:28:37.96
Oh, and a pro baseball player.

2534
02:28:37.96 --> 02:28:38.96
Right.

2535
02:28:38.96 --> 02:28:39.96
He's a knock those out.

2536
02:28:39.96 --> 02:28:40.96
Johnny Kim.

2537
02:28:40.96 --> 02:28:41.96
Yeah.

2538
02:28:41.96 --> 02:28:42.96
Come on, bro.

2539
02:28:42.96 --> 02:28:45.96
So we also have discipline to go to freedom field man.

2540
02:28:45.96 --> 02:28:46.96
Oh, Mike in the dragon.

2541
02:28:46.96 --> 02:28:47.96
So forget about Mike in the dragons.

2542
02:28:47.96 --> 02:28:52.96
There's a bunch of police officers right now around the country that are doing this kind of reading of Mike in the dragons.

2543
02:28:52.96 --> 02:28:53.96
I see a bunch of.

2544
02:28:53.96 --> 02:28:56.96
So I appreciate them all spread in the words.

2545
02:28:56.96 --> 02:28:58.96
Dispening for freedom field manual.

2546
02:28:58.96 --> 02:29:01.96
Extreme ownership in the dichotomy of leadership.

2547
02:29:01.96 --> 02:29:06.96
The leadership lessons from combat that I wrote in my brother, Dave Babin.

2548
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:08.96
So check those out if you haven't got them.

2549
02:29:08.96 --> 02:29:11.96
Ashland front is our leadership consultancy.

2550
02:29:11.96 --> 02:29:13.96
What we do is solve problems through leadership.

2551
02:29:13.96 --> 02:29:15.96
Go to echelon front dot com.

2552
02:29:15.96 --> 02:29:16.96
Yes, we are alive.

2553
02:29:16.96 --> 02:29:19.96
Yes, we are engaged right now.

2554
02:29:19.96 --> 02:29:21.96
We're doing a little digitally.

2555
02:29:21.96 --> 02:29:22.96
How's that working out for you, Dave?

2556
02:29:22.96 --> 02:29:23.96
Awesome.

2557
02:29:23.96 --> 02:29:24.96
So good.

2558
02:29:24.96 --> 02:29:25.96
So legit.

2559
02:29:25.96 --> 02:29:26.96
It has been awesome.

2560
02:29:26.96 --> 02:29:27.96
Yeah.

2561
02:29:27.96 --> 02:29:33.96
It's it's a instead of us flying out and spending five hours in an airplane to get to talk to you for two hours or three hours.

2562
02:29:33.96 --> 02:29:34.96
No, we're there.

2563
02:29:34.96 --> 02:29:35.96
Two hours and three hours.

2564
02:29:35.96 --> 02:29:38.96
We're faced at face with you on the internet.

2565
02:29:38.96 --> 02:29:40.96
We're answering your questions.

2566
02:29:40.96 --> 02:29:45.96
And since we didn't waste five hours coming out there, we're going to do it again with you next week.

2567
02:29:45.96 --> 02:29:46.96
And the week after that.

2568
02:29:46.96 --> 02:29:48.96
So it's been a really cool transition.

2569
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:53.96
And I'm sure you don't will go back when when the pandemic is over.

2570
02:29:53.96 --> 02:29:55.96
We'll go back and we'll do live stuff.

2571
02:29:55.96 --> 02:29:57.96
But man, if we aren't, we are completely.

2572
02:29:57.96 --> 02:30:05.96
We are having such such an incredible impact that we weren't able to achieve before because we were always logistically moving around.

2573
02:30:05.96 --> 02:30:08.96
And now it's like, no, we're right here.

2574
02:30:08.96 --> 02:30:12.96
I was, I was talking to a client today.

2575
02:30:12.96 --> 02:30:17.96
And I was doing an example of what it's like when the subordinates are blaming up the way we're going to be.

2576
02:30:17.96 --> 02:30:20.96
And so the woman that asked the question, you know,

2577
02:30:20.96 --> 02:30:25.96
and I was pointing right at the camera and I was right in the camera's face.

2578
02:30:25.96 --> 02:30:31.96
And I'm like yelling and it's just if, if that wasn't on a, if that wasn't on the internet.

2579
02:30:31.96 --> 02:30:33.96
You know, she would have been whatever.

2580
02:30:33.96 --> 02:30:36.96
Ten rows back and I would have been, you know, there would have been a disconnect.

2581
02:30:36.96 --> 02:30:38.96
There's a little bit of a disconnect.

2582
02:30:38.96 --> 02:30:41.96
No, I'm right, you know, and I'm just, you know, I'm just, you know, I'm just looking around.

2583
02:30:41.96 --> 02:30:44.96
And I go, this is what happens when you don't tell the team what's going on.

2584
02:30:44.96 --> 02:30:47.96
They start saying, you don't understand.

2585
02:30:47.96 --> 02:30:48.96
You don't give us the sport we need.

2586
02:30:48.96 --> 02:30:50.96
And I'm doing it right, the camera, it's, you know, it's funny.

2587
02:30:50.96 --> 02:30:52.96
I'm just having fun with it.

2588
02:30:52.96 --> 02:30:54.96
But that's like an effect you don't get.

2589
02:30:54.96 --> 02:30:56.96
You don't get that live.

2590
02:30:56.96 --> 02:30:58.96
So it's been very cool.

2591
02:30:58.96 --> 02:31:04.96
And the other thing that we've really kind of kind of just gone after right now.

2592
02:31:04.96 --> 02:31:06.96
And gotten after is EF online.

2593
02:31:06.96 --> 02:31:11.96
So EF online, which was, which was a very static platform of, hey,

2594
02:31:11.96 --> 02:31:14.96
you can come on here and go through these courses.

2595
02:31:14.96 --> 02:31:17.96
And, you know, we got great feedback on the courses.

2596
02:31:17.96 --> 02:31:23.96
But right now, since we're all, since we all have this opportunity to step up,

2597
02:31:23.96 --> 02:31:28.96
we're doing this live stuff on a, well, we're doing it three times a week right now.

2598
02:31:28.96 --> 02:31:29.96
We're stepping it up.

2599
02:31:29.96 --> 02:31:35.96
And what's great about it is once again, look, there's 200 people or 150 or 100 people

2600
02:31:35.96 --> 02:31:38.96
that are sitting on the internet during a call.

2601
02:31:38.96 --> 02:31:41.96
And people can ask a question right there on the spot.

2602
02:31:41.96 --> 02:31:44.96
Can say, hey, Jocco, I got this, you know, I got a subordinate that's doing this.

2603
02:31:44.96 --> 02:31:45.96
What do you think I should do?

2604
02:31:45.96 --> 02:31:46.96
Oh, okay, boom, here you go.

2605
02:31:46.96 --> 02:31:49.96
Oh, well, explain, give me some more detail on that.

2606
02:31:49.96 --> 02:31:52.96
So it's like on the podcast, you do Q&A.

2607
02:31:52.96 --> 02:31:54.96
We do Q&A. I read the question.

2608
02:31:54.96 --> 02:31:56.96
But that's just my interpretation of the question.

2609
02:31:56.96 --> 02:31:58.96
There's no feedback loop.

2610
02:31:58.96 --> 02:32:04.96
So when live, EF online, it's like, hey, explain what you mean.

2611
02:32:04.96 --> 02:32:06.96
Explain the relationship you have.

2612
02:32:06.96 --> 02:32:08.96
Give me some expanse.

2613
02:32:08.96 --> 02:32:12.96
Give me some more commentary on what it is you guys are trying to achieve.

2614
02:32:12.96 --> 02:32:14.96
So you get these detailed questions going on.

2615
02:32:14.96 --> 02:32:16.96
And by the way, you got a bunch of people there.

2616
02:32:16.96 --> 02:32:18.96
We're all listening to each other.

2617
02:32:18.96 --> 02:32:21.96
And everybody is going, oh, yeah, I had that happen.

2618
02:32:21.96 --> 02:32:23.96
Oh, here's another way to handle it.

2619
02:32:23.96 --> 02:32:24.96
So it's been phenomenal.

2620
02:32:24.96 --> 02:32:25.96
Go to EF online.com.

2621
02:32:25.96 --> 02:32:29.96
If you want to check that out, we got the leadership primer.

2622
02:32:29.96 --> 02:32:31.96
We got immediate action drills.

2623
02:32:31.96 --> 02:32:32.96
We got Q&A is going on.

2624
02:32:32.96 --> 02:32:33.96
So check that out.

2625
02:32:33.96 --> 02:32:34.96
The monster.

2626
02:32:34.96 --> 02:32:37.96
We are still going to go live at some point.

2627
02:32:37.96 --> 02:32:43.96
The one in Phoenix canceled, but September 16th and 17th in Dallas, Texas.

2628
02:32:43.96 --> 02:32:51.96
Or sorry, Phoenix Arizona, September 16th and Dallas, Texas, December 3rd and 4th.

2629
02:32:51.96 --> 02:32:58.96
Many of the people that were going to come to Orlando, which was canceled, just moved to either Phoenix or Dallas.

2630
02:32:58.96 --> 02:33:01.96
So those are going to sell out quicker than normal.

2631
02:33:01.96 --> 02:33:05.96
Everything we've ever done has sold out. So go to extremist.com for details.

2632
02:33:05.96 --> 02:33:08.96
If you want to come to one of those events.

2633
02:33:08.96 --> 02:33:12.96
And we have EF Overwatch and EF Legion.

2634
02:33:12.96 --> 02:33:24.96
So taking veterans that understand the principles we talk about and placing them either at an executive position through EF Overwatch or frontline leaders through EF Legion.com.

2635
02:33:24.96 --> 02:33:26.96
EF Overwatch.com.

2636
02:33:26.96 --> 02:33:32.96
Come and find the leaders you need to help your team win in those locations. And if you're a vet, go to EF.

2637
02:33:32.96 --> 02:33:34.96
If you're a vet, go to EF Legion and sign up.

2638
02:33:34.96 --> 02:33:38.96
Go to EF Legion. We got companies calling us right now that need to hire.

2639
02:33:38.96 --> 02:33:40.96
Look, there's a lot of companies that are laying people off.

2640
02:33:40.96 --> 02:33:44.96
There's also a lot of companies that business has gone through the roof that are hiring right now.

2641
02:33:44.96 --> 02:33:51.96
Go to EF Legion.com so we can get you out there and the world can know about you that are looking higher.

2642

Good people.

2643
02:33:52.96 --> 02:33:55.96
And if you haven't had enough.

2644
02:33:55.96 --> 02:34:01.96
Of my droning overbearing voice or you haven't had enough of Echos.

2645
02:34:01.96 --> 02:34:07.96
The aggressive ramblings or Dave's hyper enthusiastic viewpoints.

2646
02:34:07.96 --> 02:34:12.96
Then you can get more of us on the inner webs.

2647
02:34:12.96 --> 02:34:17.96
On Twitter, on Instagram, and on Lying the Fison Book.

2648
02:34:17.96 --> 02:34:19.96
Dave is that David Arberg.

2649
02:34:19.96 --> 02:34:24.96
Be ERK E echo is adequate Charles and I am at Jockawilling.

2650
02:34:24.96 --> 02:34:29.96
And to everyone that's out there right now oversees in uniform protecting our great nation.

2651
02:34:29.96 --> 02:34:34.96
Thank you and to police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

2652
02:34:34.96 --> 02:34:37.96
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service.

2653
02:34:37.96 --> 02:34:39.96
Thank you for protecting us here at home.

2654
02:34:39.96 --> 02:34:45.96
And also to all the doctors and nurses and medical personnel that are on the front lines.

2655
02:34:45.96 --> 02:34:50.96
Every day right now risking disease to fight disease.

2656
02:34:50.96 --> 02:34:53.96
Thank you for stepping into the breach.

2657
02:34:53.96 --> 02:34:56.96
And to everyone else out there.

2658
02:34:56.96 --> 02:34:59.96
The path is hard.

2659
02:34:59.96 --> 02:35:04.96
And it is filled with obstacles and you may never get to the top.

2660
02:35:04.96 --> 02:35:06.96
In fact, you probably won't.

2661
02:35:06.96 --> 02:35:11.96
But keep striving.

2662
02:35:11.96 --> 02:35:24.96
Keep pushing. Keep maintaining unmedicated daily discipline in all things by going out there every single day.

2663
02:35:24.96 --> 02:35:27.96
And getting after it.

2664
02:35:27.96 --> 02:35:31.96
And until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockaw.

2665
02:35:31.96 --> 02:35:42.96
Out.
