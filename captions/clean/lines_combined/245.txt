00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel podcast number 245 with Echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, Echo.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000 Good evening. Also joining tonight is Dave Burke. Good evening, Dave. Good evening.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000 Did you make it to the status of honorary co-host yet?
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000 Yes, no. Well, as thinking we're getting there, people want to know why they call it good deal Dave.
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000 This is the fact that we've been talking about that this is why.
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000 Check. Back again tonight was some more combat lessons from the from the document called combat lessons.
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000 Document written in the throws of World War II and what they were doing was interviewing front line leaders and front line troops.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000 In fact, the subtitle is rank and filing combat. What they're doing and how they're doing it. We've covered two of these so far.
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000 And this is the third one. And you know, sometimes I think to myself, you know, I mean, we kind of get the idea, right?
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 And I'll start filming. So I started filming through this one.
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000 You know, do we really need to cover another one of these?
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000 So I start filming through it and you just start reading these things.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:27.000 And I can't put it down and I'm still learning. And so I figure if I'm learning we can all learn why why trying to hold it back from the people.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000 No reason. We can get right into it. So here it is combat lessons.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000 Volume three.
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And we've done two of these so far. Actually, I forget what number podcast they are, but we've covered two of these volumes. This is the third volume.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And this is what the all the volumes start off with this quote, the Paramount Combat lesson learned from every operation is the vital importance of leadership.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000 Which is really an interesting thing that we say every single time we talk to people.
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000 Our equipment, our supply and above our all men and above all our men are splendid.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000 Aggressive and determined leadership is the priceless factor, which inspires a command and upon which all success in battle.
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000 This in battle depends.
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000 It is responsible for success or failure. And that is July 3rd, 1944.
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Starts off just jumping right into leadership. Leadership and command need for leadership.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000 Comments receive from all active theaters continue to emphasize the need for competent and aggressive leaders.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000 This is especially true as regards junior officers and non commissioned officers.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000 Lieutenant General Courtney H Hodges who observed operations in North Africa and Italy stated.
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000 And before I even get to that.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:07.000 Well, why is it why is it just so awesome that they're just pointing out over and over and over again in each one of these volumes that leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:22.000 And yet we work with companies that have no leadership training for their people until actual lunches off and then I guess they do.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000 But it's bizarre that it's a bizarre that it is so hard.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000 What makes it so hard to see that leadership is the most important thing.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000 What do you think makes it so hard to see?
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 I stumped good deal.
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000 Yeah, well, no, there's a couple of things that first is I don't think people realize how impactful leadership is.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:59.000 They almost convince themselves that hey, what we can do is, you know, if we bring in people with these skills or software suite and they get so wrapped up and always other components, they lose sight of the fact that.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000 This thing, this intangible thing that you can't really track with the spreadsheet. They lose sight of how important it is.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 And I think the other part that we're seeing a lot now is.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000 People lose sight of how often you have to keep addressing leadership.
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:23.000 And so they think it's sometimes like, hey, no, I understand what a good leadership is like and and they think they are applying it, but they don't realize that hey, I've got to keep addressing this over and over and over again.
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000 And they lose sight of not just how important it is, but also how important it is to sustain it. And when we come work with companies.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000 The more we work with them and the longer work with them, the more they want to keep doing it, they realize man had had no idea how long this journey was going to be.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000 But the ones that figured out.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000 Dude, they they elevate so quickly.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000 They get so good so fast when they make it a priority.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:03.000 So the first thing that you said, you are defacto not detached when you're inside of a company, you're firefighting day to day, you're trying to figure out what the next quarter is going to be.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000 And you're trying to figure out what's going on with this. It'll seem so you're just in it.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000 And so you start to lose track of the fact that this is this is all about leadership.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000 Yeah.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000 So that happens.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000 And that's why when we come in with a company, we can immediately see because we are detached.
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:33.000 That is part of it. The other cool thing analogy here is when you start doing Gigiitsu, you know, you get through that point where you realize how much you don't know.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000 When you realize, wow, I got a lot to learn.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000 And a leader, you can read the book and be like, you can read extreme ownership.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000 Yeah, I got this.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000 But that's like the first two, three moves that you learned in Gigiitsu.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000 And you think you're good to go, but you don't realize you need to drill. You need to practice. You see, there's so much more to learn.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.000 So those are the things I think that yeah, can can inhibit people from recognizing what we say all the time.
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000 What every freaking book that I read says.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000 Leadership's the most important thing. So getting into what general Hodges had to say,
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000 few division commanders are satisfied with the qualities of a major percentage of their platoon commanders. Ouch.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:26.000 Too many of them are lacking in aggressive leadership, self-reliance and ability to meet emergencies.
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:41.000 Inefficiency of officers in this group, in carrying out orders strictly and in making accurate reports as to locations, dispositions, and information gained was especially stressed by one division commander.
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000 So that's a horrible outlook.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000 And if you feel that way, what do you supposed to do about it? That's why you need to implement training for your subordinate leaders.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000 And that's exactly what this next recommendation is. Course for NCOs, that's non-commission officers.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:14.000 Lack of leadership on the part of non-commissioned officers was also frequently reported. In one division in reserve, a special course was designed to develop more aggressive leadership in non-commissioned officers and to make squad, to make the squad a real fighting team.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000 Train to use the firepower of its weapons to the maximum. This leadership course consisted principally in what is termed battle drill.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:40.000 While most comments on leadership deal mainly with leadership during actual contact with the enemy, the true leader, recognizing the responsibilities of his position must exercise leadership at all times.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000 And it's interesting. Leadership strategy and tactics. What's the most important thing you have to take care of your people?
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:58.000 What is this unsparing in your efforts? Even as you read, even as I read that the first time I read it, I read it.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:18.000 I read unsparing in his efforts and you think it's going to say to provide the discipline mandatory for combat operation.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:30.000 Unsparing in his efforts to take care of his units by providing the comfort. And there's the dichotomy at the same time ensuring proper maintenance and safeguarding their equipment.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000 And then what it should say there is their training, right? It's not going to save guarding their maintenance and equipment. That's cool.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000 But you got to make sure that they're well trained and ready to rock and roll in the time comes.
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:57.000 Erosponsibility. In this connection comment of Colonel Maurice E. Barker-Fith Army Italy is interesting. Younger officers seem to lack a sense of responsibility for the men under their care and for the equipment entrusted to them.
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000 They seem to feel that there is an inexhaustible supply of equipment and that all they have to do is throw stuff away when they no longer lead it.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:16.000 Of course, the non-commissioned officer follow their, the non-commissioned officers follow their lead. This lack of responsibility is tremendously important and something drastic must be done about it.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:27.000 Hey, Colonel Maurice E. Barker, you know, should do something about it? You should. Because if your junior officers are lacking the sense of responsibility, guess what?
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:37.000 Who's fault is that? Yes, yours. That's one part. The other thing that I learned here is of course the non-commissioned officers follow their lead.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:48.000 And that's a subconscious thing that happens. You get somebody in charge and you get somebody that's, whatever they're doing, where they're,
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000 under-performing or they're treating things as if they don't matter or they're thrown equipment away, treat whatever they're doing. The junior people are going to follow them. That's the way it works.
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000 Along this same line, Lieutenant Colonel E. W. Gibson, G. 2. 43rd Division, New Georgia commented,
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:24.000 The chief fault of the inexperienced officer is that he does not realize his responsibilities with respect to looking out for his men. Finding them food and water, checking their bivouac and seeing to their clothing.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:37.000 If he will evidence his concern for their welfare, he can forget about morale, they'll fight.
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:53.000 Who would have thought that if you actually take care of your people, they'll fight.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.000 Did it say, hey, if you bark orders at your people, they'll fight? No, didn't say that.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000 Did it say, hey, if you impose hardcore discipline on them, they'll fight? No, don't say that either.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000 It's it, what you have to do is just show evidence of your concern for their welfare.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000 And then they'll fight.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Why'd spread effect? Junior officers and noncommissioned officers seldom realize the widespread effect on major operations of their failure to do their particular jobs properly.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:47.000 Being an excellent fighter is not enough unless the junior leader performs his other command functions in an efficient manner, the resulting failure of his personnel or equipment can impair the whole action of a major unit.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000 Again, if my people don't recognize that, who's fault is it?
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:05.000 And this one, this one in particular isn't the cast in the blame, but it should say, make sure you tell your junior officers and noncommission officers what the widespread effect of their failure would be.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000 The following common is from the Division Commander 36 Division Italy.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000 At Solerno, Kaillessness was noted in the landing of communications equipment. Most communications failures are believed to be the result of Kailless handling of the equipment by personnel.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:28.000 Without communications, even the best train troops are very often cannot be employed where desired. So yeah, didn't waterproof your radio correctly and everything falls apart.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000 Through your radio and to the bottom of the landing craft and it got bang around and the tubes broke.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:44.000 Total failure. Why? Because no one emphasized the fact that, hey, your job as the radio man is the most important job of anyone out there.
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000 And if we can't make communications, doesn't matter what else happens, if we can't make communications, we're going to fall apart.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 Next section, practice and more practice.
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Commanding General, third Infantry Division Italy, the development of leadership is largely a matter of practice, practice in leading.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.000 Make these lieutenants actually lead exercise their voice and issue commands require high standards of physical condition.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000 Always got to throw that in there.
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Make these lieutenants actually lead.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000 Having James Weber when he went through the basics school.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And then got done with the basics school and then had 12 days of leave and then he landed in Vietnam and they drove him out through the A.O.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000 And appointed at a ridge line and said, there's your platoon up there.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000 Okay, who am I replacing? Well, you're not replacing anyone. The lieutenant that was there is no longer there because he's dead or wounded.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:04.000 So there's a sergeant that's been running the platoon. Go take over. Walk up the hill, he takes over that night. He's calling for fire, total mayhem.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000 And he was, I was like, well, were you ready for that? And he said, yes.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000 That's square away.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000 Were you ready for that action coming out of OCS or coming out of coming out of the basics school?
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000 Dude, I'm listening to you talk about this. And the first thing I'm thinking is it sounds like somebody read this and took some action.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000 Because I was the beneficiary of by the time I got in the Marine Corps.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:41.000 The NCOs, the middle level enlisted Marines that on paper were subordinate to me, but really were way more experienced than me.
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:50.000 They didn't let me fail. And so I can tell you right now, second lieutenant Burke when he had his first group of Marines was an idiot.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000 But I was lucky because rather than my subordinate in listen Marines kind of following whatever stupidity I might be.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000 They were putting me guys, they actually say hey, sir better way to do it might be this or something like that.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000 But I got really good leadership up the chain.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000 So that lesson, that lesson somehow was taken hold from this 1944 and how because Marines are taught from the get go.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000 The smartest thing you can do is a young lieutenant is the listener's staff and CEOs.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000 Listen, your gunnies, your staff sergeants, those Marines who on paper work for you, you're going to learn a lot from them.
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000 And thank God, my junior and listen, didn't listen to me at all. They understood that they needed to lead up the chain.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000 And for me to look at you guys, I would be ready to know where I was ready.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000 When I walked out of TBS and I walked into whatever that first thing that I did, had I not had that leadership up the chain.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000 I would have struggled much more than I did, much more than I did.
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000 The other thing I take away from this is you need practice, practice and leading, right?
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000 And there was, there's situations in business, right?
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000 Because we work mostly with businesses now.
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000 What you have is an opportunity to train leaders all the time day in day out.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000 There's always situations where decisions need to get made, where there's low level decisions that need to get made.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000 Well, there's medium level decisions that need to get made.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000 Whether it's high level decisions, when maybe you still need to make the decision, but at least you can allow them to attempt to make that decision.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000 And maybe get corrected or maybe get a pattern back for you.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Good way to think through that issue.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000 So this does happen.
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000 And if you think about the fact that every opportunity you get, you say, you know what?
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:43.000 Hey, junior personnel, once you run this project, once you organize that logistical movement that needs to take place, why don't you run that meeting?
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000 Every time you get that opportunity, take it.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000 Because that is what you're doing.
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000 You're letting your subordinate leaders practice leading and they need it.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000 And you let them do it in an environment where, look, I'm going to let them run an in-house meeting with just our company.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000 So that way, if they screw it up, no one sees it. It's okay. We can debrief it later.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000 I'm not going to let them go out and brief the client on what we're going to do and have them drop a ball on that.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000 But after I see them perform well, three or four or five in-house meetings, then they've got control in their confidence. They're doing a good job.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000 Cool. Hey, why don't you brief this part of this thing to the client?
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Okay. Yeah.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000 And then we go from there.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000 So as a leader, every opportunity that you get, give your subordinates.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000 And then we go all the way down to the front lines, the opportunity to practice leading by actually leading.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000 Let them lead some stuff.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000 Yeah.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000 And most decisions that we make in business and anyone like most decisions aren't catastrophic.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.000 Most of the decisions, even if we get them wrong, they aren't going to destroy our company or have these catastrophic effects.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000 And that's not as if it's a free pass. You still need to have these guard-rails in place.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 You don't want your people to be able to drive the truck off the road.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000 The truth of the matter is, is that giving your people opportunity isn't that hard because even the things that you push down to their level and help them,
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000 when they get it wrong, which they will, most of those will not undermine your company.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000 Now, be smart. Just like you said, I'm not just going to cut loose my random guy.
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000 I take this high. Our number one client, our biggest money maker, just go figure it out. Call me when you're done.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000 But the decisions that we make, there are so many opportunities to let other people even get along a little bit and get involved, have a small part of it and watch that grow.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000 And just have confidence that the decisions, most of the decisions we make aren't going to lead to catastrophe.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000 Yeah. I did that piece on EF online. I don't know. It was maybe a month or two ago.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000 But it was that. It was like, listen, very few decisions that you make are final decisions.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000 In fact, almost none of them, and furthermore, just about every interaction you have is up for further negotiation.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:58.000 So if Dave and I are arguing about something and Dave wants to do A and I want to do B, we can walk away and it's not like that is what's going to happen in most cases.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000 Most of the time, there's going to be further negotiation. And if I may be subordinate, my ego and say, alright, Dave, let's go with your plan.
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000 I can go back and reinsert some of the things that I thought might be a little bit smoother if we did it the way I was thinking.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:20.000 And once we start to see that, it's good. So we move forward with a little bit more negotiation. And you're right. Those are the opportunities where you let people lead.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000 You know what prevents us from doing that?
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000 Is when I want to be in charge. Man, it feels good to be the man. Right? It feels good to be the man.
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000 Well, it's crazy about that as it, you is when you're my boss, you're the guy in charge.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:49.000 When you take something that you're responsible for and you give it to me, you don't look weak. You actually look even stronger than you are like that fear or that, hey, I want to be in charge.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:01.000 I look like I'm in charge. When you give people on your team that work for you, the chance to lead. And if you actually put yourself in a position to follow them, you look so much stronger than when you refuse to ever do that.
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:14.000 You want to know something that I haven't quite figured out yet. I know it exists. I know it happens. I know it's a thing. But it has to do with detachment.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:25.000 It has to do with perspective. It has to do with ego. It's these three things. So you have you have perspective. You have detachment. And you have ego. So here's what happens.
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:38.000 Dave, let's say I do something. Let's just the scenario that you just gave. Right? If I'm the boss and you work for me and I walk in and say, hey Dave, you know what we got this project?
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:52.000 Why don't you go ahead and take ownership of this thing and run with it? Now, when we look at that, we know we know that from the outside that that increases your respect for me, right?
00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:08.000 But how often do we see someone that goes, Dave, here's what we're doing and here's how we're doing it because in the back of my mind, I'm thinking, well, Dave doesn't want to think that I don't know what I'm doing. Dave needs to know that I have the plan and he needs to know that actually I'm the boss.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:24.000 So even though when you're not in it, you know that it's a bad move, but you do it. Or sorry, when you're not in it, yeah, when you're not in it, you know what the right thing or the wrong thing to do is we just make that mistake all the time. I see it.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000 I play this game with clients like, who would you hire, who would you fire?
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:44.000 When if Echoes in charge of us and Echo walks in and you and I run charge of a project, but we work together on a project and Echo says, hey, you guys missed the deadline and I go, well, it's because Dave didn't finish his part of the project because he is late.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:57.000 And then he, you know, Dave walks in the office and in Echo says, what happened in Dave says, well, you know what, I actually need to perform a couple things. I could have done a better job here. I should have supported Jocco a little bit more so that we could have completed the project.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000 Look, okay, which guy are you going to give the next project to? You're going to give it to the guy to go on a ship all day long.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000 Everybody knows that. Everybody knows that and here's the thing that I haven't quite figured out. Everybody knows that and then when they're in it, they say, oh, he's Dave's fault.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000 It's just the way it's so horrible.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000 It's like a lesson that you try and teach to people over and over and over again. The lesson is detach.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:35.000 Take your ego out of it and understand it from the bosses perspective or from the subordinates perspective, see it from the other person's perspective and you'll see it's so obvious that you're making a bad call.
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000 It's so obvious that you're making a bad call, but when you're in it, you do it.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:52.000 So detach, take your ego out of the picture and see the other person's perspective, which by the way, when you tell someone a story or you show someone example,
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000 that's exactly what's happening.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000 They're detached. They're ego is out of it because it's not them and they see the better perspective because they're not in it.
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000 There's a little, there's a little triangle of justice.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000 A little triangle of how to proceed and assess what you're doing.
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000 It's detachment, it's perspective and it's ego.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:35.000 If you can remember those three little things that little triangle of decision making, it's going to put you in the right place way more often than if you lose either one any of those three.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000 You put your ego in there, it doesn't matter. It overrules them. You don't see the perspective of now. You don't know what's happening. You're not detached. You're in it. You lose.
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000 All right. Every infantry lieutenant should be thoroughly trained in firing all the infantry weapons.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000 He cannot know too much about them. He may have to fire direct a fire of several weapons.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000 He never knows when. Good. Good.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000 The next thing. The theory is not enough.
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.000 A thorough and practical knowledge of his job is the basis for efficient leadership.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000 This knowledge must be gained in a practical way by exercising leadership under all conditions.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.000 Too much of our leadership training has been theoretical in nature. There has been too much dependence on listening to lectures.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000 Opportunity must be given to the junior officer to put the theoretical knowledge to practice by actually leading criticisms of errors made.
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000 It must be so couch that they do not destroy the initiative and spirit of the individual.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:46.000 Just what do you think? Like you know. I really come up with this thing about how to debrief people and how to do it in a nice way so that they actually receive it.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000 Hey, this is 19. What I say 44, 43. This guy's already figured all this out.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Theoretical. This is what's nice about role playing. This is what's nice about the FTX program.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:06.000 And this is what's nice about living in a business where you can actually put people in leadership positions when they can practice the theory that we're talking about.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:13.000 Because someone can you can explain to someone how to do a jump shot basketball. You can explain that to him for two weeks.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000 They'll have a concept in their mind. But then I go, they get on the foul line.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000 Leadership on the beach. Fifth and fabeous cortarawa.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:36.000 Squad and platoon leaders must expect that the mixing of units and an apparent state of confusion are normal in an operation of this nature.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000 When troops of gain the beach and coordinated battalion and company attacks are broken up by the enemy pill box defenses.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000 Leaders whether lieutenant's corpals or privates must take the initiative and push on with the men in the vicinity.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000 Whether of their own units or not. This assault was very successful because men moved on in spite of heavy losses.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.000 So I was talking about something with Darryl Cooper on the unravelling podcast.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:27.000 We have something called an error box when you're doing a dive underwater. And the error box is when you're diving underwater you're being impacted by the currents and the tide and your own physical
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:36.000 Productivity as you dive. So if I put you on a blindfold and put you underwater in a pool right and set dive in a straight line and you were blindfolded.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:46.000 You would not dive in a straight line. You'd be a little bit off. Then if I gave you a compass, you could maintain a little bit better, but you'd still be off a little bit wouldn't be perfect.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000 And then you put tide and current and now you're going to be off.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000 I assume it's very similar to flying a plane like a plane may drift a little bit to the left, right?
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Okay, so it's the same thing.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:13.000 So what you have to do when you're diving is you dive so that you can you want it. What you're looking for is a reset reset point where you know exactly where you are. So example, if you're going to dive in a bay or in a harbor.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000 You would aim the first thing you would do is aim at a big quay wall. That's 500 yards long.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:34.000 You're not going to miss that. Even if you had to dive 500 yards to get to that quay wall, it's a massive target. But when you get to that target, you might adrift it 20 or 30 yards to left or 20 or 30 yards to right or even 40 or 50 or 60 yards to left or right depending on the tide submitting on the current.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000 So when you actually hit that quay wall, you have no idea where you are.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000 What you've done is you've landed inside the error box.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:52.000 So then what you do is you take a right hand turn when you hit that quay wall. Once you take that right hand turn, you go to the end of the quay wall till you get to the corner.
00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000 Now guess what, you know exactly where you are. And then you're next, you can swim your next leg, but you've tightened up that error box.
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:10.000 So what we need to do when we're planning is we need to figure out if we can reset that error box at any point.
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:23.000 How can we do it? And if we can't do it, then we need to pay attention to that. So what we were talking about actually was Syria and you go into Syria and you think, hey, we're going to do this little thing in Syria and it will have this impact and we'll be good to go.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000 And what you're saying is I'm going to hit with one, I'm going to hit right when I'm aiming for.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.000 Well, what are the chances that they're not really good. So what do you do? Oh, you need to figure it out. You need to figure out if it's the error box is hey, we might go to 10 to 10 to the left turn to the right.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000 Now we know. And by the way, if we don't get a reset there, our next leg is going to have an even bigger error box.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:58.000 So when you look at something in a strategic way like Syria, what your assumption has to be, you have to, you have to go through that whole thing as if your error box never got reset.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:11.000 And you missed every single time and by the end of it, then you have to look at the total cost of what it would take to solve that ultimate situation. And that's what you have to be willing to commit.
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000 And we don't do that. What we say is, well, we'll go in and do this and have this impact.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:36.000 And then from that perfect spot that we know, we'll do something else and it will be perfect again. And so the same thing happens in business. What people, unfortunately, have a tendency to do is they plan with a positive attitude.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:45.000 And we don't want to plan with a positive attitude. We don't want to say, well, you know, Dave, if we make drinks,
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.000 we're going to, if we put, if we put a drinks in a can, our assumption is they'll all, every can is going to be perfect. They'll be no error.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000 Well, there's going to be error.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000 And then once we want to get to the stores, while they're getting shipped to the stores, nothing is going to happen to any of them. There's going to be no damage to goods.
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000 And then once they're in the store, none of them are going to get stolen. And then once they're bought at the store, none of them are going to get returned.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:26.000 So if you have that attitude, it's a mistake. So you have to plan with a negative attitude at least to be able to cover whatever contingencies you have at the end of the day, which is, you know what people will buy it.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000 Right, that's the last thing you say is, once the cans are in the store, people are definitely going to buy it because I like the way this tastes.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:43.000 Well, actually, that's not necessarily true. Your taste buds are different than everyone else is in the world. So you can't assume that, oh, this is just going to fly off the shelf. No.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:31:01.000 What are you willing to invest if your error is calculated and exponentially increased every phase of your operation? Think about that to keep yourself out of trouble.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:18.000 Orientation. Then this is ridiculous. Ridiculous. The awesome. The need for explanation. The American soldier always performs better if he knows the wise and where force of the problem confronting him.
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000 So where force? This is a word we're going to bring back into usage.
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Because what where force means it's for the cause or reason or for which reason you're doing something. That's what where for means. So you need to know the wise and the where force. You need to know the reason that you're doing something.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:47.000 His willing and intelligent cooperation can be gained if commanders will take the time and effort to explain the situation.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:32:00.000 The mission, the plan devised to accomplish meant the effect success will have on the general situation. In short, everything concerning the operation that the time and available information will permit.
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000 Wow. It's crazy.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000 This is why you don't want me as a co-host.
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000 All I want to do is sit here and just listen to you read this thing.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000 I don't want to say anything because I'm listening to that and he's like, God, that is so good.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:21.000 It's so good and yet how often do we run into a company in the front lines and you go to talk to them and they don't understand why they're doing something.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000 It's so straightforward. I was thinking earlier, yes, that question right at the beginning.
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000 Sometimes when we start working with companies, one of the reasons why they reach out to us is even in these, they'll have these initial calls. They just reach out. They want to have just a call.
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000 But what does that sound front do?
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000 And one of the things they'll say is like, listen, we don't really know how to do leadership training. We don't really know what to do.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000 So that's why they reach out to us.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000 That's why the book, that's why extreme ownership is so good.
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000 And that's why listening to this stuff is so good because it, this stuff isn't complicated.
00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:06.000 It's not complex and we create these things in our mind that it's so difficult and it's so new on leadership is so simple.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000 Now, the application is hard. It is hard.
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000 But the reason the book is so good and the reason I will, while listening to this, like how much more straightforward is that be.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000 Explain to your people why they're doing what they're doing and they'll do better.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000 And then we see those missteps at every single level.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000 And our job is to find out, hey, why aren't you explaining it to your people?
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000 Sometimes it's like you say, hey, their ego gets in the way they want to look weak and we pull them back and give them that detachment they're perspective.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Hey, do you think is a leader? If you just spend a little bit of time telling your people why they're doing what they're doing?
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000 Well, that makes you look worse or better as a leader.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000 They get the answer right every single time.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000 But it's because we're coming in from the outside helping them see it in a way that they wouldn't see it before.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000 But none of the answers are complex and as I'm sitting here and I don't want to go.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000 I just want to listen to this book, be read out loud because there's that simplicity to it.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000 But he's talking about the world we're too bad of field in my brain. It's like that fits everywhere.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000 That's every company we've ever worked with. It's every problem I've ever had.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000 It's all the same thing.
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000 Yeah, and for anyone that's worried about, well, what if you don't have time? Yeah.
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000 There's going to be times where we don't have time. And guess what?
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000 If you've done this time and time again and now you're making a call, people go, got it.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000 He's going to fill me in later.
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000 But he's telling me this for a reason and I'm going to move forward.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000 Yeah.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000 Back to the book, such explanations will do much to forstall rumors, anxiety, and mass hysteria.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.000 All factors which contribute to incidents of war, neurosis cases, which is, you know, people shell shock or,
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000 or I guess it's not PTSD if it's during the conflict, right?
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000 But guys breaking down. If people know why they're doing what they're doing,
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000 they will have much less of a chance of breaking down.
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000 And we actually talked about this.
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000 Late late, late, late talked about the fact that one thing that we could have done better
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000 is explain the bigger picture of what was happening.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000 And the reason we saw, the reason this became so obvious is because
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000 the guys in Tasking Abuser that were involved in the planning and that were involved in
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000 picking targets that were involved, the figure not where we're going to position overwatches
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000 that were going to battalion level briefs.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000 And these were all different guys throughout the chain of command, whether it was the point man,
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000 whether it was the lead sniper, whether it was the platoon commander, the platoon chief,
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000 but they all understood the why and the where force.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000 The guys that we were saying, hey, get your gear on and go on on the mission,
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000 those were the guys that had that, that had a rougher time of it psychologically.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000 So that's on us.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000 And you know, as Leif explains in the book, when we got back and we put together
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000 the brief that I was briefing to the Naval Special Warfare community at large about what we had done.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000 And Leif for the first time put together, wow, we went and helped the one one AD,
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000 went back to city, even he didn't really assemble that in his head.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000 So I'm sitting there and he said that.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000 He's like, man, we really had a big impact and I'm like ashamed because if he didn't
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000 really see that, how in God's name could one of his frontline guys see it.
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Now look, part of this is because that trust that Leif did have and Seth St.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000 think like, hey, we're going to go get after it.
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000 You know what those guys say?
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000 Roger, point me in the direction of bad guys and we will go and get after it.
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000 But not everyone's feeling that way, especially if two months, three months, four months,
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000 five months into a deployment.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000 Who's fault is that?
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 100% on me?
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000 100% on me.
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000 So there you go.
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000 There it's plain as day.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000 Explain to your people the wise and where force.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000 It also makes them, it also makes them more resilient when things go wrong.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000 So when you know, we've, you talk about losing somebody.
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:13.000 You talk about just the devastating effect of losing someone on your team.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000 Those are the type of events that you can fully understand why people want to just tap out.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000 They just don't want to keep going through this and we were going to memorials.
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000 I think we had a stretch that every beginning it was 60 k a and 30 days.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000 Something really bad.
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000 The more connected you are, the more you understand those things,
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000 the easier it is for you to look at that.
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000 It's no less.
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000 It's still so crushing, but you can still power through that if you understand,
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000 but if you don't understand and you are disconnected,
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000 those type of critical events, those catastrophic events,
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000 do so tap out all over the place.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000 And so it also allows you to endure the hardest things are going to happen.
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000 And the more connected you are, the more you can understand why you need to keep moving forward when those things happen.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000 Yeah, 100% and on top of that,
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000 what I initially thought you were going to say was by the way,
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000 this is the foundation of decentralized command.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000 Because what they're talking about, they're not talking about decentralized.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000 They're just talking about willing and intelligent cooperation,
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000 which I guess is you could interpret as decentralized command,
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000 but if you want somebody to build to make decisions and lead out in the battlefield,
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000 they need to know the wise and where for us of what's happening.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000 This is the foundation of decentralized command on top of that,
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000 what you said is absolutely true.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000 And by the way, it doesn't only apply to combat,
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000 it applies to a business where,
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000 guess what, we got to lay off 28 people.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000 And no one feels good about that.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000 And if they don't understand that it's how we're going to keep the company floating,
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000 how we're going to move forward,
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000 and this is exactly what the numbers look like,
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000 and this is why we need to make this decision.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000 If it's just, hey, I'm a business,
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 you know, where a business and we got to get rid of some people right now,
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000 it's like, no, why?
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000 Next, method of dissemination.
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.000 If possible, this orientation should be conducted by the leaders in immediate contact with the soldier.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000 By the individual, he instinctively looks to for guidance during the stress and strain of combat.
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000 It should reach the private soldier through his squad leader,
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000 the squad leader by means of the section or platoon leader,
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000 but platoon leader from the company commander and so on.
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:33.000 However, each higher echelon of command must be certain that the information is carefully and accurately disseminated by those next lower in the chain of command.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:44.000 This method of orientation also tends to enhance the prestige and influence of each echelon of leaders with those junior to them.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000 So you want to utilize the chain of command to put this information out.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 That elevates them.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:00.000 Now, there's a dichotomitous, and how did the EF battlefield that we did out at Gettysburg?
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000 We had some clients out there talking about leadership principles and one of the leadership principles that I talked about was the horses mouth.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000 Because there are certain things.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Well, in Task Unit, there are certain things that I had to tell the team.
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.000 I was no, I didn't want there to be any of the misinterpretation of any kind.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000 I am going to tell, there's been a change in the ROI.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000 There's been a change in our overall mission set.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 That's not getting interpreted through the chain of command,
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000 and I'm going to hope that the fire team leader conveys the same message.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000 Nope, it's going to come from me.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000 So out there at EF battlefield, there was a CEO that was saying,
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000 I feel like the message isn't always getting to the front lines.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000 And when it comes to important things, that can be a problem.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000 I'm like, yes, absolutely.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:02.000 If it's something that is super important, there's been a legal change or a regulatory change in what's happening in the way we do business.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000 I would be having a video teleconference and saying, hey, everyone, good to talk to you.
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000 I know where you know, I haven't talked to you in a few weeks, but here's what's going on.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000 We got this major change.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000 I wanted you all to hear from me. I already briefed your leaders on it, but I wanted to make sure you didn't have any questions.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000 So when it is a significant change, sometimes got to come from the horse's mouth.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000 By the way, if you get to do that in an optimum way, what you do is you pre-pre-pre-pre-refer leaders.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000 If you give them the opportunity to brief their troops, and then you say, hey, everyone,
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000 we get together just to re-emphasize what you heard.
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000 Boom, a little bit of both.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:45.000 Next one, tell the story, Colonel Earl Maxwell, surgeon.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000 New Georgia. A soldier needs to know what is going on.
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000 What is expected of him?
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000 What he may expect to encounter. He must have a definite objective or goal.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:03.000 Without the easiest and ultimate, with no personal interest in the efforts of his unit,
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000 and is entirely unprepared when the unexpected or unexplainable happens.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000 Without the proper orientation, he is more prone to absorb wild rumors,
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000 loose-talk misinformation, all resulting in constant mental stress and strain evidenced by apprehension,
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000 fear, anxiety, and coherence and confusion.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000 There you go.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000 There you go.
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000 You don't look.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000 We worry about, hey, people aren't going to do what I want to do, because I didn't tell them.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000 But what about the fact that now they're scared?
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000 Now they don't know what's happening.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000 Now there's increased stress because they think they might get fired tomorrow.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000 They think they're laying off half the fort. All those things.
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000 Put those things to rest.
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000 Next section, the after-the-fight conference.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000 Every effort must be made to emphasize the important part each individual plays in a successful combat of his unit.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000 A method used by one infantry regiment to accomplish this, and at the same time provide information
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000 which would furnish background orientation is described in the following comment.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000 They eat it up.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000 This little section is called Major Kermit Hansen, 34th Infantry Division Italy.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000 While I was S2 of an infantry regiment, that's the intelligence guy,
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000 I found that it aided the efficiency of the regiment to have material assembled as the fight was going on.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:36.000 When a battalion was pulled out for arrest, all the men and officers were assembled in a group.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.000 First, I would use the collected material to give them the whole picture from the viewpoint of the army, core, and division.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000 And then I would get down to more detail on just what the battalion had done, what German units they had fought,
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000 and how many casualties they had caused the enemy.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000 Such a conference keeps the men abreast of the situation, increases their morale,
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000 and keeps up their fighting spirit.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000 The men eat it up.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000 During this after-the-fight conference, I would emphasize how much of our information regarding the enemy was obtained from prisoner of war interrogation,
00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000 impressing upon them how disastrous talking could be if they were captured.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:28.000 So this is taking a debrief, a post-operational debrief, and taking it to the next level, sliding a little psychological warfare on the troops.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.000 If you're down at the bottom of the org chart, you're a frontline guy, and not just a military,
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000 you don't have to be a private or a rifleman, it's the same thing in business.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000 You've got your frontline sales folks out there.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000 If you was a leader, and look, if you're the CEO or your key leader, you've got the big picture.
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000 If you're folks on your team at the very front, can picture in their minds how they're that one little action they take goes,
00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000 all the way up, and he's described, the viewpoint of the army, like we're invading Europe.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000 This is a big viewpoint, and he's trying to get that connection, all the way down to that one little action you take.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000 When he says the eat it up, the first thing that popped my mind is, they feel like they have ownership,
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:20.000 what they do matters, and if you think what you do matters, and you can actually understand how what you do matters,
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000 you as a CEO, you can kind of, you can leave, you don't need to be here anymore,
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000 you can pack it up and let your people go to their thing, and a lot of times,
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.000 I don't have time to explain, you have to make the time to explain it because if your people make that connection,
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000 it makes your life so much easier because they feel like they own this. That is such a powerful thing.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:50.000 Yeah, you invest $1 in effort in explaining to people what's happening and it pays dividends, tenfold.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.000 There's a section here called Battlefield Galantry, which by its very title must be read.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000 Here's the subtitle. He didn't know when he was beaten.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000 Seventh Army, Sicily, during one of the more fluid situations in the Sicilian fighting, and I'd love that,
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000 because you just know how completely crazy it was, but this is even more of the more fluid situations.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000 The wire line running from the Italian command post to the rear suddenly went out.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000 Sergeant Joseph Gorleski, with three men, started back to check and repair the break.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000 After they had traveled about one half mile, they were ambushed by a patrol of 30 Germans.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000 So that's four against 30, who had managed to infiltrate our position.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000 Sergeant Gorleski and two men were wounded while the third man was killed.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000 So they're down to three.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.000 The German patrol leader called in perfect English, give up you crazy Americans.
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.000 Although severely wounded and outnumbered 10 to 1, Sergeant Gorleski ordered his men to open rapid fire.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000 After emptying his rifle, the sergeant rushed the enemy with hand grenades.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:24.000 The German patrol surprised by the unexpected stubborn resistance was defeated and driven off with the loss of a number of its men.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000 There you go.
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000 Battlefield, gallantry.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000 Aggressive action.
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000 Cover and move.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000 Getting after it.
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000 Sergeant Gorleski, just getting some.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000 Next little section protected by valor.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000 The Germans have a nasty habit at times of opening fire at extreme ranges and making you advance under it.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:04.000 While this long range fire is not particularly dangerous, dangerous, it is very disconcerting.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:14.000 The platoon of which private Shelby R. Horde was a member had been advancing under this long range fire until despite several casualties.
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000 They had secured a position within 300 yards of the gun which had been harassing them.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000 From here on, there was no cover.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:32.000 This did not deter private Horde, who suddenly spring into his feet, raised some 250 yards until he was within hand grenade throwing range.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:42.000 With four grenades, he silenced the gun and rushing in, killed four of the remaining enemy and wounded three others with his carbine.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000 He then turned the machine gun on other enemy elements into vicinity.
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:54.000 The success of his apparently suicidal rush demonstrates the fact that valor can sometimes provide protective armor.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:00.000 The enemy simply did not realize that any man would try such a thing and were not ready to put their fire on him.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:14.000 By the way, he's got a wing too, because he got, there was 300 yards away, he closed 250 yards and then he made grenade shots at 50 yards.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000 Credit.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000 General Douglas MacArthur.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:28.000 It should be constantly emphasized that there must be no thought of surrender as long as it is possible to do damage to the enemy.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000 The man at baton and corrector fulfilled this condition.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000 However, in some cases, we have not done so.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000 The Japanese soldiers always do.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:46.000 Unless all our individuals also do it, we will suffer serious setbacks before Japan is conquered.
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.000 And the word individuals is italicized.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000 And obviously, it's italicized for a reason. It's like, hey, and an individual level you cannot surrender.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000 If you can still do damage to the enemy, you cannot surrender.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000 Next thing.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000 Reorganization after the attack. Don't waste time.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:20.000 I mean, you can just say, don't waste time.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000 Lieutenant Colonel Murphy.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000 Infantry Italy.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000 When an objective is captured, immediately push reconnaissance elements of the supporting weapons unit forward behind the riflemen.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000 Get rifle groups out for security as soon as the position is captured.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000 Have the weapons battoons immediately take position to beat off a counterattack.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.000 Displaced promptly at least one half of the heavy weapons company forward to capture the objective or to the captured objective.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:54.000 Get your artillery observer up front and hurry. We were taught all these things and they are still perfectly sound.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:00.000 So what he's saying, and my point for this is you get that advantage at this moment.
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000 And the gravitational pull will be to take a breath to relax.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000 Don't do that.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:16.000 Continue's on here. Delay brings trouble. Where an outfit gets into trouble is it is usually because they haven't pushed these points hard enough.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:24.000 When they waste time just a little instead of getting set and moving stuff forward at once.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000 You probably won't have only a little time to dig in before the counterattack hits.
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:36.000 But if you set without delay, you will be all right whether you plan to keep going or hold what you've captured.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000 In football. There's a strategy called the No-Huddle.
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000 No-Huddle offense. It's literally exactly what that is.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000 Bring it on. Football. Run a play.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000 Put it up. They blow the whistle.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000 Everybody, yeah, the offense goes back to the huddle.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000 The formulas are next play. They come to the line.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000 Something defensive. Huddle all this stuff.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000 When they come to the line, they make the call.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000 Boom. They run another play.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000 You go No-Huddle offense.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000 Right. When the guy gets tackled or whatever.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000 Boom. Right on the line.
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000 Quarterback calls the play from the line in code.
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000 Rufas2.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000 Usually isn't that more fun.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000 No. It's freaking tiring.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000 Super tiring.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000 So you've got to be ready for it. You've got to train for it for sure.
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000 But what it does is the defense. So you still have rhythm.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000 You know, that rare sprint rest. Huddle.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000 Get set. You know all that stuff.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.000 If you run a no-huddle offense and they're not ready for it,
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000 you get one, two plays ahead of them.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000 You'll just march down the field if you can't take it.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000 So why doesn't that just happen all the time?
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000 Because it's tiring.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000 I know, but why doesn't someone train a piscroid where they're like,
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000 Okay, this is what we're doing.
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000 Well, so when I played in high school,
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000 the, you know, quite a smile.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 So the white man was the other team we were playing.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000 And they were, I forget if we beat them last time,
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000 or it was close or out of no.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000 I forgot what happened the last time,
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000 but this, we were going to play them again.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000 And the word on the street was they were just going to beat us.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000 Like bad. They're going to beat us bad.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000 And I always was thinking like, why would they even say that?
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000 You know, even if they beat us, we're like competitive.
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000 So it wasn't making sense.
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000 It seemed like they had something brewing.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000 Sure enough. They come out with the no-huddle.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000 Unexpected. I was like, and they just marched down the field.
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000 How many times did they do it?
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000 Until, I don't remember, but until they scored.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000 And they started and it was all like quarterback keep.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000 You know what that means?
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:32.000 No.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000 So instead of like giving it to the running back
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 or throwing it, the quarterback gets the ball from the center
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 and just runs it.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000 But these are all formulated plays where he just
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000 where he's running on the outside. He's run the left side right side middle.
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000 Like, and they were just coming in.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000 And I remember Reels and I think that was kind of a beast.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000 Yeah, Aaron Chun was this,
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000 No, did he make it?
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 He really did. He made it to the NFL or anything.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000 No, not that I know, but he made it the offense.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Made it to the inzo.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000 I'll tell you that.
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000 And I remember just how likely.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000 I remember thinking, man, I remember thinking,
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000 you guys go hotdle.
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000 Like, I can't like get my get my act together here.
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000 To tackle nobody.
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000 Because you're just so on your toes the whole time.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000 Here's the other thing. Okay. So there's that.
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000 And I still, you haven't really answered my question,
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000 which is if you're a coach where you just say,
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000 hey, we're actually going to condition ourselves.
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000 In a different way, in a non-traditional way.
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000 And we're going to be ready just to,
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000 we're never going to huddle.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000 Yeah, the thing is that's a huge undertaking.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000 The thing is we do that's a common conditioning method.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000 It's like, no, it's not an offense for like,
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000 I don't know, 10 minutes, 20 minutes or whatever.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000 Like, that's part of football conditioning practice and stuff.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000 Because when you go no huddle, you better buckle up.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000 There's no substitutions.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000 I wonder if you just get guys that were different.
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000 Like, they'd always, and they'd be smaller and skinny.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000 And have more, have less power.
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000 And then you'd end up with a team that even though they could run the no huddle offense on defense,
00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000 they would just get, they would get run through methodically.
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000 Yeah, wait, what do you mean?
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000 Meaning if everyone else on the other team is just
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000 jacking steel and doing cleans with three,
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000 15 and they're going to,
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000 we're going to get some bunch of guys that are weighing in at 170
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.000 because they're doing this no huddle offense all the time.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000 Yeah, yeah, I could see it.
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000 You'd end up with different physics.
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Yes, for sure.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000 And some teams, they'll, they'll kind of have that more in their strategy.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000 Yeah.
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000 And you know, some teams, they pass the ball more or they run the ball more or some,
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000 you know, some, know huddle that's like some huddle that's hard to do.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000 There's a quarterback keeps a lot.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:41.000 As a port as opposed to quarterback sneak, which is different.
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yeah.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.000 Anyway, no, well, I would say the explanation for that is it can be risky.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.000 Because if you're going to know huddle, no huddle, and then the defense,
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000 like, oh, we're ready for the no huddle.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000 Then it's like, man, you get shut down.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000 And it's like, all right, it's different now.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 You understand?
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000 Yeah, and now you're laughing.
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000 The other thing is, I was wondering about footballers.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.000 You know, you see like a trick play on YouTube.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000 Yeah.
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000 How come everything's just not a trick play.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000 Yeah, because they're risky.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000 Just like you did to like you do this trick moves in.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000 You do to you get like a group of people who figure out that trick.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000 They're going to shut up.
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000 You're, they're not going to, it's not going to work.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Say that. It becomes not a trick play now.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000 Yeah.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 It's no longer a trick play when people know.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000 So yeah, and there are teams who, and that's actually kind of how the no huddle is to.
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000 It's kind of, it's I wouldn't call it in the realm of trick plays,
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.000 but it's kind of one of those things that's it's unorthodox.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000 So the unorthodoxness of it is part of the advantage.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000 You know, so it's like there's another play called the reverse, right?
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000 It's like a, we'll call it a common trick play.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000 Yep.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000 Go to the other side of the field, right?
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000 No, it's a, they haven't shown my ignorance here.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:48.000 Yes, sir.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000 But it's okay.
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000 You're good at a lot of things.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000 What the fuck are you wanting to do?
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000 Or reverse is like, let's say, okay, so you got, you're having guys essentially, right?
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000 You got the quarterback behind the center and they say set down whatever, right?
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000 If it's a running play, I'm going to get, if it's, you can run it up the middle, right?
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000 That's usually for short yardage situations.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000 We'll need three yards for this first time.
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000 That's a power to ever power through exactly right jump.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000 I might even jump three.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Maybe that's more of a one yard half yard situation.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000 But whatever, right?
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000 Then there's like an outside run, which is you can either give it to the running back and he'll run on the outside.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000 But anyway, whatever side you're running and right side left side, whatever, there's no like,
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000 there's no like, oh, we always run to the right side.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.000 We always run, you know, they're tens not to be that much of that going on.
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000 But when you run, when a play is going to the right side, we'll say,
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000 you can see it.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000 All you lemon guy is start, look, if I, if I'm not, I'm not starting.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000 That's the same.
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000 They go back to the other side now, right?
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000 Yeah, but this is, this is how they do it though.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:48.000 So I was right.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000 I guess that's an ambiguous statement go to the other side, so I don't know.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:53.000 Maybe.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000 So what's about to happen?
00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.000 So they either, I mean, there's plenty ways to do it, but they basically show that this play is running to the right.
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000 So then they say the running back is running to the right with a ball.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:12.000 If I'm on the online on the front, the front line guys, you're going to step right because you got to get in front of the defense this way because they're running behind me.
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000 So I'm saying, so when you look at the offense as a defender, you see the whole offense as a group.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000 They flow to a certain side. You know, that's where they're going to pass play.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000 They're just going to sort of stay in place because the quarterback is dropping back and you got a pass through seeers go right.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000 So you can see all this stuff on the defense.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000 So boom, the whole offense is flowing this one side.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000 So the actual tendency is to roll that side. That's hard. And then what happens there.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000 One receiver or maybe the tight end or something like this, he goes over, he steps on the only guy.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000 One step back and goes all the way around the quarterback or the running back.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Sometimes they give it to the running back.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000 That running back gives it to him going the other side.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000 Go over the other side because the other side.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000 Exactly.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Correct.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Yes.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000 So that's an unorthodox play overall.
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000 That's not a typical play.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.000 But it's not like when you see it, you know, okay, they run the reverse.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000 It's a play.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.000 Yes.
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000 But it's unorthodox.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000 But you get there are teams that run a lot of those types of plays.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000 But once the defense knows all of they run these kinds of plays, it doesn't work as good as all of that.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000 It's like when leg locks.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000 Yes.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000 People start getting our memory trained with people that thought that leg locks.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000 We're just totally the they were the solution to Gigiitu.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000 Right.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000 But we did we did we did leg locks.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000 Yeah.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000 We did even more leg locks.
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000 Then some guys that thought that leg locks were the solution.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 The Gigiitu are all of a sudden they try the leg locks.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.000 The leg locks weren't working.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000 Yes.
00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000 We were doing leg locks more than the leg lock people.
00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:39.000 Yeah.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000 So yeah.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000 So then they had to try and do regular Gigiitu.
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000 And then you.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000 Yeah.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000 And you get it.
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000 Well, okay.
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000 So good example.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000 So the leg locks.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000 Right.
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000 So remember and let's go old school.
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000 You'll see.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000 I think one or maybe two.
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000 I forget.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000 But it was Ken Charmer.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:54.000 Ken Charmer.
00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000 New.
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000 Some leg locks or whatever.
00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000 You sat back for one.
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000 Right.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000 So this is that that's an example of what happens.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000 If someone knows your trick play on orthodox play, but it's on orthodox for a reason.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:12.000 Just like I said, if it's like so effective on to just do it all the time, well, because it probably has more risks.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000 If everyone's on a reverse, right, in football.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000 If everyone's blocking to the right and we send one guy back to the left, you rely on them getting trick that everything's going to the right.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000 If they see the reverse all the time, it's the only I see right, but get ready for the reverse that lone guy running around is going to get creamed.
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:37.000 You know that that situation with Ken Charmer, I can voice that shows you how really a little bit beyond.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000 The the graces at that time were even more highly developed than you thought they were.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000 Yeah.
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000 Because with you when you watch that sequence, boys immediately, he had a mega sapper,
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000 a record of perfect leg lock defense.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000 That was on top.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000 And now he's on top.
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000 Yeah, it was the perfect leg lock defense at a time where basically no one was doing leg locks in due to.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000 So it's pretty awesome and it's pretty impressive that even at that time,
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000 he had the defense for the leg lock now.
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000 I don't know, maybe they maybe they saw enough of it or they knew that it was a possibility.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000 Because Ken Charmerock was, what was he championed?
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:24.000 Yeah, that was great.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000 Yeah, that was great.
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000 So there's a video, this is a old school video where it was hoiler and Hicks and doing it.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000 Essentially a demonstration might have been a pride or something like that.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000 It looked like maybe in the middle of pride maybe a half time situation.
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000 Okay.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000 It's so it looked like so it's cool.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000 But that's not more old school than UFC 2.
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000 You see what I'm saying?
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000 Yeah, it might have been.
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000 So by the time they're teaching at pride, yeah, everyone's kind of doing leg locks by that.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000 But you know, like they do such hardcore fundamental like stuff.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000 Yes, this is this is really the feel you got.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000 And part of the demonstration was a leg lock submission.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000 Mm-hmm.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000 It was like the basic straight, a straight ankle lock.
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000 Straight ankle, yeah, exactly right.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000 So you know, like when they do those demonstrations, you know,
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000 it's all just the basic, the fundamental Gracie just to find out.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000 Yeah.
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000 And now it's in there.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000 It's not like they're like, okay, let's dance a little with some new age stuff.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000 It was there's another guy here's a straight ankle.
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000 This is Gracie, you just see it exactly right.
01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000 And it was part of it.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000 Yeah.
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000 So you figure, yeah, of course they did that stuff.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000 Yeah.
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000 With the Gitu by the way.
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000 Yeah.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000 And that's what I'm saying.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000 Yeah.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000 What I'm saying is it's impressive because if you're thinking like, well, you know, back then they even do
01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000 the foot locks at all.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000 Yeah.
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000 It's like, well, and actually know who did a lot of, you know, who did a number of foot locks to finish people.
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000 Hoiler.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.000 Really?
01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000 Yeah.
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000 Whether it be snagging.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000 It's off of people.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000 Exactly right.
01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000 I mean, now the whole foot lock game is a whole, you know, it's interesting.
01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000 But again, going back to Gracie, can Shamrock, it's, that's the example where it's like, oh, if
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:06.000 they're good foot locks back then, we're such a cheat move, like such an easy, like short cut, you kind of move that you surprised people.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000 Like, why don't you just do them all the time?
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000 And then can Shamrock sort of camp was kind of like, well, yeah, we do.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000 That's part of how we win.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000 You just get one guy to figure out the little trick and you're exposed a lot of the time.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.000 That's why it's a trick move.
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000 Otherwise it'd just be fundamental move.
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000 Yeah.
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000 So a trick move that you use all the time is not a trick at all.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000 It's just another move.
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000 It's just another move.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000 And here's a thing.
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000 It'll occur.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000 Maybe another move if it has a high part or a high risk involved in it.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000 Yes.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000 That's usually what trick moves.
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000 Which is what Ken Shamrock got caught with a high risk move that actually,
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000 voice was able to capitalize on.
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000 He's on top and Ken Shamrock's on the bottom, same thing with the reverse, same thing as a hail mayor.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000 Not that actually that's not a trick move, but same thing like a, what do you call it?
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000 The one where you sweep it to the running back and then he throws the ball back to the quarterback.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Yeah.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000 You've seen those moves.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000 It's like, that's a trick move.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000 You can see guys kill with that, but Brown run back to Ken through the ball.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000 That's such a high risk move.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000 Oh, don't let the quarterback get, make a catch and get cream by one of the DBs.
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000 Now you're quarterback's out because he doesn't take as much punishment as the rest of the guys on the team.
01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000 So let's all this risk.
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000 You can see.
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000 Yeah.
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:18.000 When Dean got Kakaraco in the absolute finals with the, what we called the Kakaraco,
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000 He'll hook, which is now called 50 50.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000 But you could see that Kakaraco there was confusion.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000 And I mean, obviously he's an incredible world champion himself, but there was not,
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000 You could see like he was not aware of what was happening.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000 And Dean was obviously.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000 He was always happy.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000 But now we've seen plenty of people.
01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000 Oh, you want to go to 50 50 with me?
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000 Okay, cool.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000 And there's defenses and a whole new year.
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000 So now it's now not a hugely advantageous trick move because it's just a normal move now.
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000 Right.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000 And then that's a good example is one of one of these things that, you know,
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000 When you create a whole system around like foot locks, for example,
01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000 that you start to eliminate all the risk factors that come with it.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000 That's what a system does.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000 You know, it eliminates lingering problems, whatever becomes like an actual
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000 effective system.
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000 If you, if you can't eliminate the risk, it's,
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000 It's not a system.
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000 You're just over here throwing risks out.
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000 Really, hopefully you won't, you know,
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000 and that's what I think some of the old foot lock guys or people,
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000 they'll be like, Oh, I'll just jump for for locks.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000 Oh, yeah, sure.
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000 I'm, you know, it was definitely a thing.
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000 And it's not based on like a system systematic foot lock game.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000 Like how it is like Dean had so early on, you know?
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:29.000 Mm-hmm.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000 That's why I think he was, he was as effective, you know?
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000 Definitely very effective.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000 We'll say.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000 Yes, sir.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000 All right.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000 Let's go back to where we were at.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000 So we were talking about not delaying when you get in certain situations.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000 And it was talking about, you know,
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000 once you, once you do an attack, you get in a position,
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000 then you need to immediately set yourself up and,
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000 and get your defense ready immediately.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:57.000 Don't wait.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000 And then there's a, let's jump and forward to a section here where they talk about,
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000 how do you do that?
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000 Like, what's the methodology from making that happen?
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000 Well, here you go.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000 Reorganization aided by prior planning.
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000 Lieutenant Colonel at hern.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000 And Italy.
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000 From the batying commander's point of view,
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000 the most vital feature of reorganization is prior planning.
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000 By that, I mean deciding well in advance,
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000 whether all machine guns are going to display it forward immediately.
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000 Only half of them deciding what areas the 81 millimeter mortars are going to cover.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 What areas the 60 millimeter mortars are going to cover,
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000 various companies cover, all this planning is vital,
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000 so that the prompt issuing of orders for reorganization
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000 can be affected immediately following the capture of the objective.
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000 Think about where you can use that in your,
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000 in your entire world business life,
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000 everything that's going on.
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000 Hey, when this happens,
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000 we're going to do this immediately afterwards.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000 That is the deal.
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000 There's a comment here.
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000 This is from the editor.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000 All comment on attack tactics against the Germans
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000 emphasize the importance of prompt and thorough reorganization of the attack.
01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.000 Unit when it reaches its objective.
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000 It is necessary that this be accomplished in order to oppose
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000 effectively the habitual German counterattack.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:16.000 And it goes on reorganization of an attack unit must begin at the elementary squad level
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000 and work to the top.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000 Have squad leaders organize their squad.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000 It's section leaders supervising the work of all squad leaders that
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000 platoon commander assisted by the platoon sergeant supervisor.
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000 The work of the section leaders and so on,
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000 chain of command, the company commander must be planning the defense of the position.
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000 Checking the dispositions of his weapons and coordinating the fires of his mortars.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000 With his artillery support, so what does that say?
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000 It's decentralized command.
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.000 So pre-planning what you're going to do when you win is a really important thing.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:52.000 And then once you win, immediately execute the plan.
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000 This happens with companies that they close the deal.
01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000 They close the deal.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000 Hey, I close the deal with whatever with Bill.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000 If they're smart, they have a follow-up plan.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000 It's a emails coming two days at her hay bill.
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000 Just follow-up, want to make sure you got the support that you needed.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000 And by the way, I also want to let you know we've got some other features that we are adding to our product in two weeks.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000 When it comes out, I want to let you know that's happening.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000 And also, I know that you've got some affiliate businesses that you also work with.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000 I would like to reach out to them and see if we can help.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000 You know what I'm saying?
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000 Like you have a plan.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000 A winning plan.
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000 Yeah.
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000 That's uh, there's just, and there's a slight difference between because as long as
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:46.000 that plan isn't contingent on like the fact that you went because just a little while ago, we're talking about, you know, the idea that, okay, my whole comprehensive plan,
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000 every move, like one, the next move is dependent on you executing the first move.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000 Right.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000 Meanwhile, there's a lot of wiggle room in that first move.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000 There's levels of success, you know?
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000 So you literally can't go to the second plan if you don't achieve this sort of thing,
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000 which is a, that's a variable over there.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000 However, just to shut you down.
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000 No, I'm saying there's a difference there.
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000 I'm saying don't get confused in there.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000 Let me tell you what the difference is.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000 This is important because you brought about totally valid point.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000 Tactical echo.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000 It gets, it gets, it gets, it gets a W, but it's about to get a little bit revoked.
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000 Here's the deal.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000 So you're right.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000 We don't know exactly how it's going to turn out.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:26.000 Right.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000 We don't know what that way and it actually looks like, but here's,
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000 here's the deal.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000 Both section that I just read, what did it say?
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000 It said, let your section leaders lead, let your squad leaders lead.
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000 So what you say is listen folks, once we secure this objective,
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000 we are going to immediately develop a defensive posture.
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000 That means this.
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000 You spell out what your intention is.
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000 And then you're subordinate leaders through decentralized command,
01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000 step up and fulfill your intent immediately based on the
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000 particulars and the variables of the outcome of the victory.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000 Yeah.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000 One mission for patrol.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000 A patrol should have a single and soul mission.
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000 There appears to be a general tendency upon the part of staff officers
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000 and immediate commanders to add a second mission just because the patrol is going
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000 to be in the vicinity of some point in which they are interested.
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000 I believe this is that this point of a single mission is highly important.
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000 So, you're telling your people, hey, this is what I want you to go do in
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000 these hang by the way to this and by the way to this, doesn't help.
01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000 What do you got there?
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000 Leg locks?
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000 No.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000 You ball?
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000 Quarterbacks, Steve?
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000 Whatever, real.
01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000 These lessons are everywhere.
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000 You're making that point about, hey, we just close the deal with Bill.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000 We're not done.
01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000 And that was kind of a micro example of like,
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000 juggle closest they will build, but I'm going to reach out to Bill on Monday
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000 and we're going to keep looking and I was thinking into the context of this idea
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000 of hey, when we accomplished the mission or we have a win or whatever that
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000 success ends, that's true at that very small tactical level that
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000 emailed a bill.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000 It's also true at this strategic level.
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000 At the highest level of, we work with companies and one of the things we do with
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000 the senior executive level is we help them build these big strategic plans, the five year
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000 plan.
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.000 But the five year plan doesn't just map out five years and then at the end of those five
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000 years we are done.
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000 That five year plan, the five year cycle never ends.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000 And so when we achieve these big victories in business, nothing really ends.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000 It just leads us to the next things we can get bigger and bring more people in.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000 That's true in sports.
01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000 It's this idea that the win that we're looking for isn't the end of it.
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000 The win that we're looking for is what allows us to start to do more and bigger and other
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000 things of what that long range strategy is, which actually in the business is we're working
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000 with there's no end for them.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000 They're going to get bigger.
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000 They're going to get more dominant.
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000 They're going to be more successful.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000 They're going to branch out in other areas.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:11.000 And I, I'm a big fan of Echo sports and allergies, but the win, even if you think like the team that
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000 wins the Super Bowl, you know what they want to do as soon as they win the Super Bowl.
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000 They want to celebrate that in other school.
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000 They want to win the next Super Bowl.
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000 Because I'm not, they become the story of, oh yeah, you guys won the Super Bowl and you didn't
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000 even make the playoffs next year.
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000 This idea of when you win, you have to plan to have something to do right after that, which is
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000 you don't want to rest, you don't want to take any.
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000 And that's the worst thing we can do because that win is fleeting.
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000 And you don't email Bill, you're going to lose Bill because someone's going to get in there
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000 and you don't get Bill's content.
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000 You're going to lose those contacts too.
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000 And that win is going to be meaningless in the long run unless you recognize the win is just another
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000 step as you move in the port.
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000 Yeah, that's, that makes sense too, right?
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000 Where it's like, and you mentioned you super quick, barely mentioned this.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000 Sure, you want a party right after right after you win the Super Bowl.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000 So, you know, the classic story, right?
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000 Like you have certain champions, right?
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000 Whatever they win the Super Bowl, they win the heavyweight title, whatever.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000 Next day they're training already.
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000 Yeah.
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000 Seems like that's like the real champion, the win.
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000 The win, well, you get like the one time champion, right?
01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000 Who maybe like, I don't know, whatever.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000 He's the one time champion.
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000 He goes, he wins and what's he doing?
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000 Party and cruising.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000 Oh, I need to take a couple of weeks off vacation.
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000 I'm going to go spend my bonus money, whatever.
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000 And you know, I'm quite whatever for a little bit.
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000 Meanwhile, like you, you seem to say, it's like it makes sense.
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.000 So the guy who who can strategize like, yeah, I won, but, you know, like the real
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000 champion is going to get back to work immediately.
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.000 No.
01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000 It's kind of that, you know?
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000 It's 100%.
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000 That's why these principles from combat apply to everything in life.
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000 Yep.
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000 We're not just outspending our bonus money and co-eye.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000 No, that's not necessarily, no.
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000 Poor map reading.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000 But, trolling to provide security was generally good, but patrolling to maintain contact
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000 and determine enemy positions and movement was often slided.
01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000 Many patrol leaders lack the ability to read a map and locate themselves.
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000 This resulted in incorrect information being brought back failure to reach the objective
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000 and an inability to call for fire support.
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:19.000 Some patrols didn't know the situation and what to expect and what specific information
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000 was desired.
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000 They were not properly briefed prior to starting.
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000 So, once again, if we have a team who doesn't know where they are, they're useless.
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000 What does that mean?
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000 If you have a team that doesn't understand what they're making, how much they're making, how much they're producing,
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000 what their raw materials, what the level of their raw materials are, what level of say all those things.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000 If people don't know where they are, they're worthless.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.000 Infantry notes.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.000 I get to read books that have sections that are called Infantry Notes.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000 I'm a happy human.
01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000 Inter-unit liaison.
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000 Major General Lucas, Italy.
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.000 Experience has shown that enemy offensive action is usually along the boundaries between units.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000 Boom.
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000 Ramadi.
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.000 This fact emphasizes the need for closely-aisoned and constant contact between adjacent units
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000 from squads on up.
01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000 Maximum benefit from coordinated action will be realized if commanders will ensure that the following conditions are met.
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.000 Exchange of actively-aisoned personnel between adjacent units.
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:38.000 Close contact between frontline organizations and a mutual agreement to ensure maximum combined
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.000 protection along the boundary, proper fort to adjacent units of any unusual activity.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Early advice of plans for attack counter attack or withdrawal together with a request for assistance desired from adjacent units.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000 Commander should know at all times what units will be directly affected by their action and realize that it is their responsibility.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000 To keep those concerned informed.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.000 So look, we work, we interact with all kinds of different groups, all kinds of different departments, all kinds of different divisions, all kinds of different companies.
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:13.000 We work with companies all the time that all rely on other companies to get their job as B2B, right?
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000 It's business to business.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000 How do we...
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000 Where does the weakness usually fall?
01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000 Where does failure, I shouldn't say usually, where does failure often fall?
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000 It's in those seams between those two businesses.
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000 So what do you do?
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000 Here's some suggestions.
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000 Exchange actively-aisoned personnel, right?
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000 Actually trade some people.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000 Hey, take this person off take that person, let him run that project, let him work through this project.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000 Close contact between organizations.
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000 Mutual agreement.
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000 To work through those problems that you're going to have.
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000 Prompt reporting.
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000 Hey, echo if your...
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000 T-shirt business can't supply my silk screen business.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000 Can you please tell me?
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000 Right?
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000 That's what we want.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000 Thank you.
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000 That backwards, but yeah, I understand.
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000 What did I say if your silk screen business...
01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000 If your...
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000 T-shirt business can't supply my silk screen business.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000 Why do you think I have that backwards?
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000 Because usually silk screen provides service for the T-shirt business.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000 I guess so.
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000 I could go...
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000 I can't get it to a street yet, you're right.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000 So either way...
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000 I need to make sure we're talking to each other.
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000 Maybe I'm running out of ink.
01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000 Yeah, and now I'm not going to be able to print your shirts.
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000 Maybe my sales are going down.
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000 I can't supply you with that business.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000 It won't depend on that anymore.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000 It seems saying...
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000 There we go.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000 Early advice to plans for a tack counter attack or withdraw.
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000 Right?
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000 So if I'm going to be printing a ton of shirts...
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000 I tell echo, hey man, I got a big order from another company.
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000 I'm letting you know if you're going to need something here's the wait time.
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Yeah.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000 Okay, let's plan through that.
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000 Okay, great.
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000 I've got to do it.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000 Commander should know it all times what units will be directly affected by their action.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000 And realize...
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000 As my response is what I just said, it's my responsibility for telling you, hey, I've got a bunch of other stuff.
01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000 I've got a print.
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000 If you need something, you better tell me ASAP.
01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000 Okay.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000 A sap surely.
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000 Use your rifle.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000 It's another good heading.
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000 Colonel Harry B. Sherman, commanding officer, infantry, Italy.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000 We have a hard time getting riflemen to use their rifles.
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.000 They depend too much on artillery and supporting weapons.
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000 In most cases, it would be better if they fired even if there's no visible target.
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000 A group of infantry, a group of riflemen may be stopped via German machine gun, which they can't locate.
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000 But if they open fire in the general direction of the machine gun, the Germans will usually pull out.
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000 I believe that we have placed too much emphasis on fire orders and fire control by unit leaders.
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000 Men must be taught to open fire at once in the general direction of any target that is holding them up.
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000 Without waiting for any squad leader or any other individual to tell them to open fire.
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000 What is that?
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000 As decentralized command.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000 And it's also going on the offense.
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000 And it's also covered move.
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000 Yeah.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000 Is that kind of like in the UFC when a guy gets hit real hard?
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000 And he just starts swinging.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000 Kind of like that.
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000 When he gets hit, so if you punched me really hard, my reaction is just to start swinging.
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000 A little bit.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000 Kind of.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000 Yeah.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000 Yeah.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000 Actually, I would say accurate.
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:21.000 It's like I'm in Gjitsu when someone is Dean gets a good position on me.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000 And I always do this.
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000 It's bad defense.
01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000 It's kind of like that.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000 Like he starts going to spazz out sort of moving like crazy.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000 Yeah.
01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000 It's just to like mess him up.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000 Yeah.
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000 It's throwing bullets down there.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000 Yeah.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000 It's like, oh, yeah.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000 You're not picking your shots.
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000 I'll tell you that.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000 Definitely not picking the shots.
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000 Yeah.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000 Makes sense.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000 Yeah.
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000 Yeah.
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000 I think that's the way you were just talking about a little while ago too, which was,
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000 Hey, doing something is usually better than doing nothing.
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000 And if your plan is, hey, let's, um, you know, we're in a difficult situation.
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000 Let's assess a little bit.
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000 Let's reach out to, you know, our supporting organizations.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000 Well, we're just sitting here doing nothing.
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000 As opposed to, hey, we've got resources right here that we can expand right now.
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000 Now, I can't win the world with these resources, but I need to use these resources right now.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000 Hey, this team get online, starting pulling, moving forward.
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000 Jocca radio back, see what kind of fire's for.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000 We have coordinate with the other agencies inside your organization.
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000 But this tendency of I'm going to sit back and see what's happening or doing nothing.
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000 What they're saying is, hey, you are given those resources, those tools that you have.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000 So you can use them.
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000 And yeah, that artillery always looks better.
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000 The airplanes look like a really cool.
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:35.000 You imagine when we were in a muddy, if every time we went on a assault, the criteria is we wanted to wait for aircraft first.
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000 Yeah.
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000 You're going to sit there all day long.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000 And I knew that firsthand as a amazingly, a liaison.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:49.000 My job as an Anglical Marine Air Naval Gunfire liaison company was to try to bring that air support.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.000 But actually, the best thing I did was support them to say, hey, listen, we can't get air for all these times that I'm not going to provide you.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000 What you need, let's come up with another way to do this.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000 And when they show up, that'll be a great force multiplier.
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000 It'll be awesome.
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000 But we're going to sit around waiting for that thing. We've got all these other assets that we can use and we need to use them.
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000 Yeah, because it's, it's real low risk, right?
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:18.000 Yeah, if I start pushing forward right now, with seems like it'll be a lot easier for just me call some artillery over there.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000 But guess what, you don't have it right now.
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:28.000 So what seems like less risk is actually more risk because action beats in action.
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000 So when I'm sitting here waiting for artillery or waiting for aircraft to come overhead,
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000 guess what the enemy, who I just knew that they were somewhere over there, they're moving, they're maneuvering and now I'm getting beat.
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000 So what seemed like less risk is actually more risk.
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000 Notes on training.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000 How I would train a company now?
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000 Captain Robert C Gates infantry, Italy.
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000 If I had to train a rifle company again, I would stress the following.
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000 Basic discipline.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:06.000 Which means smart saluting alertness of bearing, cleanliness and neatness of person, clothing and equipment.
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000 Shoes shined, haircut, etc.
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.000 Get perfection in this early as to the basics of much later training.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:25.000 Combat firing on a course, which included a lot of surprise targets, proper distribution of small arms fire,
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:33.000 over a suspected target area, use of the rifle sling, sniper training, BAR training.
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000 So the BAR's borderline heavy machine gun for them to be given to every man in the squad
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000 and to he as a thorough knowledge of the weapon.
01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000 He's one of our more effective weapons, but must be in the hands of a trained man to really be valuable.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:54.000 A BAR man in one of our companies got 20 Germans, for sure, in an hour during one of the their counter attacks.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000 This was one half the casualties his platoon inflicted credit.
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.000 Scouting and patrolling need plenty of emphasis.
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000 So terrain appreciation.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:18.000 To teach the men advantages and disadvantages of terrain features, teach them to visualize how the ground on which your located looks from the enemies view point.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.000 What he can see and what he can't see, where you can take positions unobserved.
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:37.000 So I was saying the other day that I think terrain in combat is the difference and a not 100% sure of this is the difference between a white belt and a purple belt.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:44.000 When you know terrain, when you understand how you can use that berm or how you can use that ravine or how you can use that high ground.
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:51.000 When you start to understand that, that's when you can just start to tap people out by maneuvering.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:59.000 And I'm not 100% sure the reason I'm not 100% sure about it is, is because it's this massive thing.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:07.000 It's like it's like understanding the theory of grappling itself.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:16.000 So if you if you took fighting like okay, what's a fight? It's two people swinging punches each other and trying to kick each other. If that's what we think fighting is.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000 Once you know terrain, now it's like we understand that there's a whole another dimension.
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:30.000 It's called grappling. So maybe the purple belt thing doesn't really work, but as far as just comprehensive understanding of how to fight.
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:37.000 When you understand terrain, all of a sudden you understand there is a third dimension in the game.
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000 Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I think I just talked to myself through it. I think I figured it out.
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000 That's the big thing to try and teach the young seal leaders.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000 It's like okay, the minute you move over here, the enemy can't shoot it to you anymore.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Yeah, you move for me. If you can get your platoon to move four meters as a whole to the east, you are free and clear from those guys.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000 Yeah. And that means you can now run or you can move quickly.
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000 Yeah, even like even like the high ground right, we always hear that and I probably don't understand this.
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:22.000 The amount that there is to understand about it, but it's like in fighting their positions, you can be in where you can hit them and they literally can't hit them.
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000 Like there's positions like that, but then if you don't know about them, you can ask somebody, okay, what's up position?
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:32.000 And they don't know that like grappling and I think it's really hard to figure it out.
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000 It's almost impossible, really.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000 Basically, the high ground is being on top.
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Yeah, let's say you're mounted though. Like, friends, once punching you, really, if you're mounted.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000 And you know how to fight, of course. If you're just a kid mounted during the high ground.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000 Yeah. And that's a dominant high ground.
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000 Yeah. If you're in their guard, you're still in the high ground.
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000 But you're not like in maybe the best, most dominant high ground.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:01.000 Yeah. The thing that's interesting that you got to remember about high ground is the way it your angle.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000 If you're hiding in a foxhole.
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.000 If I'm in a foxhole and you're in an elevated position above me, what good is my foxhole?
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000 Yeah. If I'm in it, if that's even if I'm in a pretty deep foxhole.
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000 If I'm above you, I can be in a shallow foxhole and I'm totally protected.
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000 Yeah. Kind of in a way. It depends on where you are, I guess.
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000 But like you don't have to be in a foxhole, really.
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000 That's got a bad guy up a little bit.
01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000 That's how good high ground is.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000 Yeah.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000 Whereas if you're on the low ground, a foxhole doesn't even really do you any good?
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.000 No foxhole.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:40.000 Not to mention you got gravity on your side, you know, which is a powerful thing.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:48.000 So terrain appreciation. So if you're if you're happened to be a military individual and you're new to the game,
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000 start thinking about terrain.
01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000 Next came off washing came off wasch discipline, particularly the discipline.
01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:02.000 Pound into the men the necessity of not making trails, not moving around with the enemy, can observe your position and similar matters
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000 until each man always thinks about it.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000 I mean, I mean, it's I told you man the best thing about being here is I just get the list of this stuff.
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000 You know, we were just talking about terrain and how it's thinking.
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:24.000 If you're you're in a competition, whatever it is, I don't care if it's just who the military private sector.
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:31.000 If you understand terrain and your opponent doesn't, you have this massive, massive disparity.
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000 It's it makes things so much easier if you understand how to use the terrain and you're fighting, you get someone who doesn't.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000 If you can be under man, you can be under resourced under equipped and it's the same thing in the private sector.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000 You don't have to be the biggest company.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:53.000 If you understand how the environment around you is working and your product or your interaction with the market does works and your opponents don't,
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000 you can be the smallest company out there and you're going to end up dominating because you understand the terrain.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:06.000 And then you were just talking about the connection to camouflage and as you're saying that we were just talking don't give away your position.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.000 And I just love how listening to these things that we talk about the connections between all the other lessons that you keep talking about over and over again.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000 And I'm just sitting over like,
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:21.000 John, could you just said that when the last time we're here and don't give away your position and camouflage,
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:29.000 how is you to not do that and he made the come as like this, especially the camouflage, which is that point he was making.
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:39.000 The the other thing, well, when I talk to people about the importance of terrain and then you translate that into leadership.
01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:49.000 What you realize is that human beings are the terrain, the people that you're dealing with.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000 They are at various elevations.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000 They have various micro terrain.
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000 They are their personality.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:06.000 Is terrain that can be high and low and that's why we literally say,
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000 take the high ground morally, right?
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000 So if echo does something, if he's working for me or where we're working together.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000 And he does something, he does something that he should not done.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000 I need to maintain the moral high ground.
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000 The minute that I say, hey, I know you took some money from that client.
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000 Give me 10% of that or else I'm going to report you.
01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000 What does that do?
01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000 I can never, I just gave up the high ground and I can never get it back.
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000 I can never get it back.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000 Everything is going to be a struggle from here on out.
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.000 So the way that you view things and if you start to view the elevations that you're seeing,
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.000 the way people behave, the way people interact, where the ravines are, where the cover is.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:04.000 Who is covering who is concealment, meaning like if I know that Dave will back me up in the deepest sense of word,
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000 but echo, he'll like stick up for me a little bit, but then he's going to bow down to whatever.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000 Temperations are there.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000 That means Dave's going to give me cover.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000 Echo's going to give me a little concealment, but then he's gone.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:22.000 Like those interactions when you're dealing with people, you're dealing with terrain.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:32.000 You're dealing with variations in the surfaces of where you're working.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000 Organization of Squad Leaders, Squad Chain of Leadership.
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000 To the point where if there's only two men left in the squad, they will know automatically who,
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000 which one is the leader.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:48.000 Keep the squad organized this way regardless of casualties and consequent replacements.
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000 Some other information, very, very tactical and selecting non-commissioned officers.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.000 I'm convinced.
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:05.000 In selecting non-commissioned officers, I am convinced that steadiness is the first asset.
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000 How do we talk about steadiness?
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000 We talk about the ability to detach, knock it emotional.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000 That's the first asset.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000 Resourcefulness is the second.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000 So how am I going to get these problem solved?
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.000 What can I use with what I have to get these freaking problem solved?
01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000 That's number two.
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000 Intellect third.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.000 I've known some really smart people that were really ineffective.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000 Flanking out machine guns.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:48.000 The battle indoctrination courses have given some troops the idea that if they attack machine guns by crawling toward the machine guns on their bellies without a chance of hitting back.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000 This is not so.
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000 They must go around and flank them out.
01:31:52.000 --> 01:32:02.000 In this connection, in training and in maneuvers, we should teach this flanking out by having our men to go over the toughest and hardest hills available as we had to do in Sicily.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.000 It's just over and over again.
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000 Physical conditioning to is all important.
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.000 Here in the so-called respiratory and all infantry men take a four mile march in 40 minutes each day.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000 Precision and snap in all basic drill, including calcetics, should be stressed.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000 Precision and snap.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000 That's something that I'm not good at.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000 What's snaping?
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000 Precision and snap.
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000 In my movements.
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000 I see some guys like doing exercises.
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000 Whatever.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000 Name an exercise.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000 I don't.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000 And I see they have a lot of snap.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000 I need to focus on that more.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000 More precision and snap.
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000 Oh, there's a little headline for you.
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.000 The hard way is safer.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Colonel Harry B. Sherman commanding officer, seven infantry Italy.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:04.000 Stress, stress, night cross country movements and night attacks don't allow the units or individuals to use any road path trail or any other easy route of advance.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:12.000 In every case, they in every case have the move by only the most difficult and inaccessible terrain in the vicinity.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000 Rhodes past trails and even just open ground that offers easy going are almost invariably mind or booby trapped.
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:31.000 Make the men regard the most difficult ground as the natural root of advance and it will save many casualties.
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000 The easy path leads downhill my friends.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000 This is kind of epic.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000 Motors.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000 By the way, I'm skipping through a bunch of this stuff because they go through each individual like department of combat, right?
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000 But I read them all because there's always things that you can learn.
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.000 So this one is this is like the motor pool.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000 Motors need maintenance.
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000 Brigadier General Vincent Meyer commanding 18th field artillery brigade Italy.
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000 It was my experience that as soon as we moved out of the staging area and got within range of the enemies guns,
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:10.000 motor maintenance for some strange reason came to a summary end.
01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:15.000 It was partly due to the vial weather and to the slimy mud.
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:23.000 First echelon maintenance was so utterly wanting that drivers were not even checking the water level in the radiators.
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000 The motor mechanics were honestly trying to do proper second echelon maintenance,
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000 but they were exposed to the weather with no overhead cover from the rain.
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000 And we're slipping and sliding around in the mud that was inches deep.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000 It finally got them down.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000 They just couldn't cope with it.
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000 So I read you all that and I read you all that for very specific reasons.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000 So you got this. People aren't doing maintenance. The drivers that are supposed to probably do some kind of a cursory check of a vehicle.
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000 They're not even checking if the freaking radios are filled.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000 Now we got vehicles are overheating and then the secondary maintenance, these guys are out there in the weather.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000 So what is this guy's solution to the problem?
01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000 Corrective measures.
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000 When I realize the gravity of the situation,
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000 I placed an energetic leader in charge.
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000 That's what he did.
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000 That's what he did.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000 Place an energetic leader in charge.
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000 He, meaning this energetic leader, immediately scoured it around and got a place with overhead cover and hard standing,
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.000 using available buildings and got a couple of caves.
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.000 We required that the drivers clean off mud and drain old oil across the street from the shop.
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000 This helped to keep the shop in clean order.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000 As for the first echelon maintenance of my motor,
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000 my motor officer had to bear down and no uncertain terms,
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:46.000 but in two or three days the drivers were back to doing the things they had been trained to do for so many months prior to entering the combat.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000 In addition, I required every officer.
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000 So already we got multiple good things, right?
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000 You got a problem?
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.000 Look, I'm not going to solve the problem.
01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000 I put a good leader in there.
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000 The good leader starts to figure things out.
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000 Oh, where are the freaking walk around the boat?
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.000 I'm going to get overhead cover.
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.000 I'm going to get some caves.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000 And then this guy starts holding the line.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000 Hey, you need to freaking do your maintenance checks.
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000 Took him two or three days to tighten them back up.
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000 Why is that?
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000 You hold the line.
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000 What are you holding the line on?
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000 If you allow slack, they're going to take it.
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000 Bro, you think I want to do vehicle maintenance?
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000 Echo Charles?
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.000 I don't think so.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000 I don't want to do vehicle maintenance.
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000 What I want to do is get my vehicle to you and let you worry about all that crap.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000 That's what I want to do.
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000 I'm lazy.
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000 So I just give it to you. And if you accept it, guess what?
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000 I'm never doing maintenance again.
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.000 If you say, hey, bro, sorry, Jocco, you got to do your share.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000 What if I don't?
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000 I'm not taking your vehicle.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000 Two or three days later, I'm not even asking him.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000 I'm just doing my job.
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000 Okay, so those, that's awesome.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000 And then it gets this.
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000 In addition, I required every officer prior to starting on a trip with a motor vehicle
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000 to check at least one item on the car in which you was traveling.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000 For example, tires, battery water.
01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000 So then he put another little level of checks in there.
01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000 Freaking legit.
01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:11.000 By the way, all the problems that you have are leadership problems.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000 Kind of goes for your kids to write that thing.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000 That, that, that, that concept right there.
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000 Like your kids, right?
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000 If they're like, hey, get, I don't know.
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000 Throw away my rubbish.
01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000 Oh, like your kids aren't doing their vehicle maintenance?
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000 Yeah.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000 When they can, but if you do them for a,
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:30.000 they're not doing their vehicle maintenance obviously,
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:33.000 but they're metaphoric vehicle maintenance.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000 So they're not cleaning their room.
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:35.000 They're not making their back.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000 Here's my, my son just turned four.
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.000 By the way, so that's about the time, you know,
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000 give or take where they brush their own teeth.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.000 But like you expect a three and a half or your old kid to brush their teeth good.
01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000 Maybe maybe not.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000 In the beginning, when it's like two, when they start getting teeth,
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000 you brush the teeth for them, right?
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000 But if you're like, hey, you're trying to save time on bedtime scenarios
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000 and all this stuff you just come here.
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000 I'll brush your teeth and you brush them good or whatever
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000 because you're an adult.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000 You know how to brush teeth, right?
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000 But as a kid, they're going to be like turning three, turning four.
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000 And if you keep brushing their teeth form,
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000 they're just going to keep doing it.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000 Just like if you keep giving me your truck to change the oil or whatever you're trying to do to me or whatever.
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000 Same kind of thing.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000 But if you're like, hey, and actually you kind of taught me this what the
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000 tying the shoes thing, you know?
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.000 I don't care if you're trying to save time.
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000 Learn out of tiger shoes.
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000 So if you're like, hey, I'm not brushing your teeth.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000 You're brushing your own teeth.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000 You don't want to do it twice after all that, but like, I'm brushing my own teeth.
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.000 I don't want to.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000 I way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way.
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000 But man, it's just not like that.
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000 Here's what you do.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.000 Age three, you show your child the faces of meth transitions,
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000 where people are meth on fedemines and they get arrested over several years.
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000 And their teeth ended up all yellow and falling out of the water.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.000 Yeah.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000 And you say, hey, do you want to see faces of people that don't brush their teeth?
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000 Yeah.
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.000 Yes.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000 And of course that's true.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000 I don't know if I'd ever do that, you know, two, two, three, four.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000 Maybe I would.
01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000 I don't know.
01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000 But I feel like that comes before.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 That's the why.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 By the way, yes.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000 Why you brush your teeth.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000 Yes.
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000 Or that's why you get your teeth have to be brushed.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000 So now we're in phase two already.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:20.000 Where it's like, just like how you, you're going to give me your truck to change the oil.
01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000 You know the oil has to be changed.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:23.000 We already know that part.
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000 See, I'm saying, it's just a matter of whether I'm going to do it or
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000 I can do that thing for me.
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000 You can say, what if it's like, no, no,
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000 You don't want to brush your teeth.
01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000 I'm saying, look, I don't want my teeth brush.
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000 I don't want them not to be brushed.
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000 But if someone else could, okay, maybe not brush teeth.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.000 Listen, how about whatever do you do to the face?
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000 I don't know.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000 Oh, see, yeah, do the dishes. That's a big one.
01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000 What if someone's like, oh, someone always does your dishes.
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000 You know, you just sort of like, when my wife has mad,
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:59.000 that my kids didn't do the dishes.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000 And she'll tell me, like, oh, the kids didn't do the dishes.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000 As she's cleaning the dishes.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000 Yeah.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000 Yeah.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000 You know how many times I've cleaned the dishes because my children didn't clean them?
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Zero times.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000 Yeah.
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000 Zero times.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000 Yeah.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000 That's not a good way to train your kids.
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000 If they didn't do the dishes.
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000 Well, that's not actually a thing.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000 It shouldn't be a thing.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000 They do the dishes.
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000 Yeah, that makes sense.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000 That's the worst way to train my daughter's.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000 My, on the family group text.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:27.000 Sure.
01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.000 The other day, my oldest daughter posted something that's,
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000 or sent to the group text, which was a screenshot of a post that someone had made.
01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000 And it said, like, my dad talked, no, like,
01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000 dad talks about part value of hard work.
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000 He hasn't done dishes in seven years.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000 And that was the big hit on Joko.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000 Oh, are there a team doing the other shot?
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:54.000 Wait, so look, if you're not doing your own dishes, they're doing your dishes.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000 You're on the other side of that scenario.
01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000 They're not holding a line on your discipline.
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000 They have their jobs.
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000 Okay.
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.000 Okay.
01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.000 We're talking about a bigger system now.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000 Yeah.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000 This is an understanding system.
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000 I have responsibilities in the house.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000 You do?
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000 Yes.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000 Hey, all dishes.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.000 Right?
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000 It's called providing the roof.
01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000 Yeah.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.000 That's what I do.
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000 I understand.
01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000 They have their responsibilities.
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000 Things like doing the dishes.
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000 So, it was a pretty good shot.
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000 I got a kick out of it.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000 My daughter giving me a hassle.
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:36.000 Or you could get super technical and be like, hey, I don't regard doing dishes as the benchmark for hard work.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000 No, I mean, but they, fortunately, they weren't trying to have a legitimate argument with me.
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:48.000 Because they were not, they know not that it's not a, they know you're down for that solution.
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000 All right.
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000 Essentials of Jungle Warfare Jungle SOPs.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000 SOP Attack Procedures Combat Patrol.
01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:01.000 Once again, if I've got a new appointment in my life where I'm reading a document that says
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:06.000 SOP Attack Procedures Combat Patrol, I'm pretty happy about the world.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.98 One, have a covered route of withdrawal picked out in advance in case enemy pressure
01:42:10.98 --> 01:42:11.98 becomes too great.
01:42:11.98 --> 01:42:15.98 This, this is another little hint towards the value of free planning.
01:42:15.98 --> 01:42:20.98 If you're going to have to leave, tell everyone where you're going to leave by.
01:42:20.98 --> 01:42:29.98 Two, keep one squad back as a reserve and to provide a forced to cover the forward elements of the patrol,
01:42:29.98 --> 01:42:30.98 if they're forced to withdraw.
01:42:30.98 --> 01:42:31.98 Why am I talking about this?
01:42:31.98 --> 01:42:36.98 What the f-what the God's name does this have to do with anything that we're doing here in a leadership situation?
01:42:36.98 --> 01:42:39.98 Well, let me tell you, when you're in a business,
01:42:39.98 --> 01:42:46.98 When you're in a business, and I'm in businesses, you have a certain amount of capital.
01:42:46.98 --> 01:42:50.98 Those are your resources.
01:42:50.98 --> 01:42:58.78 Every military, modern, every modern military book, actually, no, it's not even just modern.
01:42:58.78 --> 01:43:05.18 If you go back and you listen to this podcast, everything that we've ever talked about, says,
01:43:05.18 --> 01:43:06.82 you need to have a reserve.
01:43:06.82 --> 01:43:07.82 Why is that?
01:43:07.82 --> 01:43:09.54 Because you're going to come up against variables that you didn't expect.
01:43:09.54 --> 01:43:14.18 So these people, when we sit here and talk about variables, and I'm acting as if, hey,
01:43:14.18 --> 01:43:18.42 here's a real cool concept about the variables and the things that could go wrong.
01:43:18.42 --> 01:43:22.18 Okay, it's been talked about for thousands of years.
01:43:22.18 --> 01:43:26.98 And in order to cover down on those variables that you cannot anticipate, you need to have
01:43:26.98 --> 01:43:28.46 some level of reserve.
01:43:28.46 --> 01:43:35.94 So when you are running a business, and you have to place resources in different things, you
01:43:35.94 --> 01:43:42.26 can buy this much produce, you can buy this much gear, you can buy this much, you spend
01:43:42.26 --> 01:43:44.78 money, let's just go let's just say money, that's a simple one.
01:43:44.78 --> 01:43:46.82 We have this much money.
01:43:46.82 --> 01:43:53.26 Is it smart to use all of two employee, all of our money at the same time?
01:43:53.26 --> 01:43:54.70 No, it is not.
01:43:54.70 --> 01:44:00.82 You must keep a reserve back because when Ecos project goes sideways, so if I say, oh,
01:44:00.82 --> 01:44:05.22 I'm going to give half my money to Ecos and half my money today, half of our, half
01:44:05.22 --> 01:44:07.38 the money that we have, half the echo and half the Dave.
01:44:07.38 --> 01:44:11.90 Oh, because we want to get the project done quickly.
01:44:11.90 --> 01:44:16.14 And then all of a sudden, Ecos hits a, it's a hiccup.
01:44:16.14 --> 01:44:17.58 What can I do now?
01:44:17.58 --> 01:44:19.22 Nothing, I have nothing off to give.
01:44:19.22 --> 01:44:24.14 So what I should do is give a third of my resources to Ecos, a third to Dave.
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:25.90 We start to move forward.
01:44:25.90 --> 01:44:28.50 You had a hiccup echo, no problem, got your back.
01:44:28.50 --> 01:44:34.90 Little reserve capital, ready to do employee.
01:44:34.90 --> 01:44:38.42 Then should be designated to watch for snipers.
01:44:38.42 --> 01:44:40.42 Now, why is that important?
01:44:40.42 --> 01:44:41.94 How does that relate to anything?
01:44:41.94 --> 01:44:46.90 What company are we talking to right now that needs to have a person designated to watch
01:44:46.90 --> 01:44:47.90 for snipers?
01:44:47.90 --> 01:44:51.02 Let me explain.
01:44:51.02 --> 01:44:58.98 When you are doing anything and you give people important jobs as collateral duties, you
01:44:58.98 --> 01:45:05.22 can anticipate that those collateral duties will not be done with maximum effectiveness.
01:45:05.22 --> 01:45:06.22 What's collateral duties?
01:45:06.22 --> 01:45:11.38 Meaning, hey, echo, I want you to navigate.
01:45:11.38 --> 01:45:14.58 I want you to cut the brush sets out in front of us.
01:45:14.58 --> 01:45:19.06 I want you to look for booby traps and I want you to look for snipers.
01:45:19.06 --> 01:45:23.46 Here's the third thing, just look, either, sorry, you're for, job as to look for snipers.
01:45:23.46 --> 01:45:25.22 How much time are you spending looking for snipers?
01:45:25.22 --> 01:45:28.14 The answer is very little if any.
01:45:28.14 --> 01:45:31.58 So what I need to do is say, echo, you've got these three jobs.
01:45:31.58 --> 01:45:32.58 Cool.
01:45:32.58 --> 01:45:37.06 One thing I really don't want to have happened is get hit by a sniper.
01:45:37.06 --> 01:45:40.22 So Dave, he's going to be in the middle of the patrol.
01:45:40.22 --> 01:45:41.22 He's not cutting brush.
01:45:41.22 --> 01:45:43.34 He's not looking for booby traps.
01:45:43.34 --> 01:45:45.78 What he's going to do is you're going to move forward a little bit.
01:45:45.78 --> 01:45:50.38 He's going to stop and while the patrol moves, he's going to be looking for snipers.
01:45:50.38 --> 01:45:51.38 That's his job.
01:45:51.38 --> 01:45:53.58 And what's the philosophy there?
01:45:53.58 --> 01:45:56.34 Because, of course, watch for a snipers important.
01:45:56.34 --> 01:46:00.94 But you don't want to compromise any of your jobs because you're spread thin or is it
01:46:00.94 --> 01:46:05.94 because a certain job kind of almost in a way requires less attention from time to time?
01:46:05.94 --> 01:46:07.78 Here's another example.
01:46:07.78 --> 01:46:15.38 We started getting EOD explosive ordinance to disposal individuals tasked to our platoons
01:46:15.38 --> 01:46:18.10 in the sealed teams.
01:46:18.10 --> 01:46:21.26 As this was happening, we started getting these guys that this was in the beginning of the
01:46:21.26 --> 01:46:25.66 war, a lot of the EOD guys that were coming on board, like they weren't, they hadn't
01:46:25.66 --> 01:46:27.90 been through any combat skills training.
01:46:27.90 --> 01:46:30.22 They didn't really know what they were doing.
01:46:30.22 --> 01:46:32.42 And of course, I didn't really know any of these guys at the time.
01:46:32.42 --> 01:46:36.46 So I'm just thinking, why would we take a regular Navy EOD guy that's used to being on an
01:46:36.46 --> 01:46:42.06 aircraft carrier in case there's an emergency with a bomb that's strapped to an F-18?
01:46:42.06 --> 01:46:43.06 Then he's to get disarmed.
01:46:43.06 --> 01:46:50.54 Why would we take that guy and try and make him basically into a seal when it seems like
01:46:50.54 --> 01:46:54.38 it could be a lot easier to me to take a seal, send him to an EOD school, you learn the
01:46:54.38 --> 01:46:56.78 skills and then if something happens, you can you can handle it.
01:46:56.78 --> 01:47:00.90 My commanding officer at the time said, hey, Jocco, here's the deal.
01:47:00.90 --> 01:47:04.14 If it's a collateral, he didn't use these exact words, but he said the exact same thing,
01:47:04.14 --> 01:47:09.62 which is, hey, if the enemy is going to be using booby traps, which they are, and I
01:47:09.62 --> 01:47:14.54 eat these, we want to have somebody that that's the focus of their life.
01:47:14.54 --> 01:47:19.02 And I, as soon as he said that, I was like, oh, good point.
01:47:19.02 --> 01:47:20.02 Thank you.
01:47:20.02 --> 01:47:27.46 We will gladly train an EOD individual so that they are focused on keeping us alive.
01:47:27.46 --> 01:47:31.82 So if you have prior, or it's, it's a form of prioritizing XQ.
01:47:31.82 --> 01:47:32.82 Right.
01:47:32.82 --> 01:47:34.30 Meaning, I can't take something that's important.
01:47:34.30 --> 01:47:39.82 If I deem something as important, I need to assign it to a person as their primary
01:47:39.82 --> 01:47:41.26 responsibility.
01:47:41.26 --> 01:47:47.70 Post out, outpost to cover, puttune, as it, as it organized the position, place loaded automatic
01:47:47.70 --> 01:47:49.50 weapons near by in case enemy attacks turn.
01:47:49.50 --> 01:47:54.74 So cover your flanks, select a difficult position to attack, preferably on high ground.
01:47:54.74 --> 01:47:57.02 I just have to say when it's has high ground.
01:47:57.02 --> 01:48:01.38 Cover trails and other likely avenues of enemy approach with well-dugging automatic weapons
01:48:01.38 --> 01:48:02.38 pits.
01:48:02.38 --> 01:48:06.94 Dig three man in placement so that they are mutually supporting and cover the area completely
01:48:06.94 --> 01:48:10.46 around the platoon.
01:48:10.46 --> 01:48:15.50 If the platoon has sufficient communication equipment, this a sound power telephone net, connecting
01:48:15.50 --> 01:48:19.06 the platoon command, post with each squad should be provided, be able to talk to each
01:48:19.06 --> 01:48:20.06 other.
01:48:20.06 --> 01:48:23.22 Booby trapped the area completely around the perimeter.
01:48:23.22 --> 01:48:26.30 Clear light, brush and fire lanes outside the perimeter for 20 to 40 yards.
01:48:26.30 --> 01:48:28.42 These are real tactical things.
01:48:28.42 --> 01:48:31.38 Arrange artillery and supporting fires.
01:48:31.38 --> 01:48:35.38 Place sharp pointed sticks, 10 to 25 feet and it goes through that.
01:48:35.38 --> 01:48:40.06 Use grenades freely when the enemy is seen or heard.
01:48:40.06 --> 01:48:43.70 Hold weapons fire until a definite target is observed.
01:48:43.70 --> 01:48:47.86 Pre-mature firing of weapons will disclose positions day to day, be talked earlier about
01:48:47.86 --> 01:48:51.66 not wanting to disclose our positions when you start shooting at night that's definitely
01:48:51.66 --> 01:48:54.66 going to happen.
01:48:54.66 --> 01:48:59.70 Must of the jungle soldier, first Marine Corps.
01:48:59.70 --> 01:49:05.46 If he is to survive, it must be second nature for every jungle soldier to keep his mouth shut
01:49:05.46 --> 01:49:08.02 on the trail.
01:49:08.02 --> 01:49:09.94 Recognize common jungle sounds.
01:49:09.94 --> 01:49:14.86 Keep his eyes off the ground when on the trail and maintain a constant watch toward
01:49:14.86 --> 01:49:18.30 the head of the column and to a selected flank.
01:49:18.30 --> 01:49:20.14 Get off the trail at Holtz.
01:49:20.14 --> 01:49:21.94 Conceal himself and observe the flank.
01:49:21.94 --> 01:49:24.74 Dig in at protracted Holtz.
01:49:24.74 --> 01:49:28.42 Know the Nambootz, the light machine gun of the Japanese, buy it sound because it is the
01:49:28.42 --> 01:49:35.50 framework of the JAP jungle organization and it is and guide to flank's and strong points.
01:49:35.50 --> 01:49:36.82 That's so good.
01:49:36.82 --> 01:49:41.22 You got to know what the Japanese machine gun sounds like because if you know, if you
01:49:41.22 --> 01:49:49.34 see where that Japanese machine gun is, it's on their flanks or it's in their strong points.
01:49:49.34 --> 01:49:53.46 Black is face and hands to and remove any shine from equipment, conserve his own ammunition
01:49:53.46 --> 01:49:57.58 and pick up a band in band allere when he sees one, memorize and invariably use the unit
01:49:57.58 --> 01:50:01.50 selected code words for leaders, various maneuvers, ammunition, corps, etc.
01:50:01.50 --> 01:50:05.38 Be able to select the night position so that the jungle works to his advantage and to
01:50:05.38 --> 01:50:08.70 the disadvantage of the infiltrating japs.
01:50:08.70 --> 01:50:13.06 I appreciate the fact that japs do not have cat's eyes that they are afraid of the
01:50:13.06 --> 01:50:18.58 dark and that at night a moving jap is an easy victim for a silent marine who believes
01:50:18.58 --> 01:50:25.14 in his bay and net care for his equipment religiously weapons deteriorate with unbelievable
01:50:25.14 --> 01:50:32.14 rapidity in the jungle and must be cleaned at every opportunity.
01:50:32.14 --> 01:50:35.66 Good.
01:50:35.66 --> 01:50:45.02 What's good about that is the main reason why I thought it was important to say that
01:50:45.02 --> 01:50:55.50 is because if you're in charge, that section right there shows you how important it is
01:50:55.50 --> 01:51:05.62 to convey to all the troops a baseline of actions that is going to help you win.
01:51:05.62 --> 01:51:09.86 Because it's easy to sit back and think well obviously you should know what this machine
01:51:09.86 --> 01:51:15.46 gun feels sounds like and obviously you should blacken your face and like all those
01:51:15.46 --> 01:51:20.82 things seem super obvious.
01:51:20.82 --> 01:51:25.54 But why are they written here because people failed to do them?
01:51:25.54 --> 01:51:29.82 So as a leader what can you look at inside your team where there might be some obvious things
01:51:29.82 --> 01:51:35.58 and by the way these things have been talked a lot lately about values and
01:51:35.58 --> 01:51:42.58 and the fact that if you have the proper values this is sort of the ultimate form of decentralized
01:51:42.58 --> 01:51:47.58 command because people can operate just based on the values.
01:51:47.58 --> 01:51:55.86 So these are almost these are like these minor things that almost become values right
01:51:55.86 --> 01:51:59.54 to use your code words every single time to conserve your ammunition every single those
01:51:59.54 --> 01:52:06.02 are almost like values that you have dig in at protracted holds.
01:52:06.02 --> 01:52:10.18 Think if you did if you were a jungle fighter and you did all these things all the time
01:52:10.18 --> 01:52:14.02 that's the way you operate your survivor ability is going to be infinitely larger than
01:52:14.02 --> 01:52:16.54 someone that doesn't do these things.
01:52:16.54 --> 01:52:21.18 So what is going on at your business inside your teams where this stuff isn't happening
01:52:21.18 --> 01:52:23.46 every single time?
01:52:23.46 --> 01:52:25.78 What do you need to tell people?
01:52:25.78 --> 01:52:27.58 What needs to happen?
01:52:27.58 --> 01:52:31.02 You know these are the things you need to think about as a leader.
01:52:31.02 --> 01:52:37.10 They're not as obvious as you think.
01:52:37.10 --> 01:52:41.26 They're also the things that your people need to know because those are the things that
01:52:41.26 --> 01:52:43.26 they need to do so you can win.
01:52:43.26 --> 01:52:48.34 Your people, the ones that aren't camouflaging their faces or recognizing the sounds of
01:52:48.34 --> 01:52:51.70 those machines, not only do they not know what they're supposed to be doing because more
01:52:51.70 --> 01:52:55.98 than likely nobody's ever explained it or taught it to them they also to understand why
01:52:55.98 --> 01:53:00.62 it's important with the significance of it and if we do this as a team we are going to
01:53:00.62 --> 01:53:03.78 win and if we don't we're going to lose.
01:53:03.78 --> 01:53:09.70 There's a reason our enemies put out snipers and it's the same thing in business is you
01:53:09.70 --> 01:53:13.74 are you are if you're running a business right now listen to this podcast and you own a
01:53:13.74 --> 01:53:16.14 company or lead a team you're at war.
01:53:16.14 --> 01:53:20.22 The people you're competing with don't want to share space with you have an equitable
01:53:20.22 --> 01:53:21.22 share of the market.
01:53:21.22 --> 01:53:24.62 They want to run you into the ground and they're going to harass you they're going
01:53:24.62 --> 01:53:28.50 to probe you they're going to watch you they're going to try to take you out they're going
01:53:28.50 --> 01:53:32.22 to set up snipers and machine and you have to know what you need to do to win and if
01:53:32.22 --> 01:53:36.30 you're people in the front lines don't know this you're going to lose and the reason
01:53:36.30 --> 01:53:41.22 they're not doing it isn't because there's something wrong with them or they're not
01:53:41.22 --> 01:53:46.54 it's because you haven't shown them why they need to do that for you guys to win and
01:53:46.54 --> 01:53:52.10 that's why these lessons get repeated over and over again and that's why it's so
01:53:52.10 --> 01:53:56.42 fun to listen to the stuff.
01:53:56.42 --> 01:54:03.22 Patrolling jungle craft lieutenant be mayor infantry boganville.
01:54:03.22 --> 01:54:08.82 I think back now on how I used to cuss when scouting and patrolling came up on the schedule.
01:54:08.82 --> 01:54:11.10 He's talking about training.
01:54:11.10 --> 01:54:15.82 I had the idea that with all the lectures and field work we had it would all come
01:54:15.82 --> 01:54:18.30 the second nature when we got to combat.
01:54:18.30 --> 01:54:23.50 Let me tell you something I have many veterans of gaudal canal in my platoon who have lots
01:54:23.50 --> 01:54:27.74 of combat experience in patrolling and they still have plenty to learn.
01:54:27.74 --> 01:54:31.82 Let me give you an example of a four day patrol we had in jap territory.
01:54:31.82 --> 01:54:38.30 In those four days we moved about a thousand yards a day starting at seven in the morning
01:54:38.30 --> 01:54:43.30 an hour stop for lunch and ending at five figure out for yourself how far we averaged
01:54:43.30 --> 01:54:44.30 per hour.
01:54:44.30 --> 01:54:49.14 It's pretty tough to move like a cap through the jungle hour after hour one man causing
01:54:49.14 --> 01:54:52.90 a little too much noise can cause the annihilation of a patrol.
01:54:52.90 --> 01:55:02.46 I sincerely mean it because it has happened.
01:55:02.46 --> 01:55:05.62 teamwork.
01:55:05.62 --> 01:55:08.38 Men must not try to fight the japs individually.
01:55:08.38 --> 01:55:14.42 A soldier fighting on his own is a most unachonomical investment and unless he is lucky he
01:55:14.42 --> 01:55:16.18 will accomplish very little.
01:55:16.18 --> 01:55:20.22 It is a rare occasion when a Japanese machine gun is not covered by other weapons including
01:55:20.22 --> 01:55:24.46 a sniper or two no one man can move in on such a combination.
01:55:24.46 --> 01:55:30.14 Fighting must be done by mutually supporting groups in order to make this system effective.
01:55:30.14 --> 01:55:34.78 Training must be continuous and every effort must be made to keep the composition of the
01:55:34.78 --> 01:55:39.06 groups unchanged.
01:55:39.06 --> 01:55:44.22 Essential standards the successful and efficient intelligence and reconnaissance platoon
01:55:44.22 --> 01:55:47.34 should have the following standards.
01:55:47.34 --> 01:55:51.26 Select personnel mentally and physically better than average each member should be the
01:55:51.26 --> 01:55:56.10 equal of the average squad leader.
01:55:56.10 --> 01:56:00.38 Regorous physical hardening.
01:56:00.38 --> 01:56:02.66 Lots of hill and mountain climbing.
01:56:02.66 --> 01:56:06.06 Science in the jungle during training they should stay out for eight or ten days at a
01:56:06.06 --> 01:56:07.06 time.
01:56:07.06 --> 01:56:09.46 Use native guides and learn how to read science from them.
01:56:09.46 --> 01:56:13.10 Have them show the men the edible fruits and vegetables.
01:56:13.10 --> 01:56:18.46 Strict water discipline both as the amount consumed and its purification.
01:56:18.46 --> 01:56:23.62 Ability to move rapidly and silently use arm and hand signals to indicate the situation and the
01:56:23.62 --> 01:56:24.90 desired action.
01:56:24.90 --> 01:56:28.78 No talking or whispering.
01:56:28.78 --> 01:56:33.22 Immatonance of visual contact front and rear left and right.
01:56:33.22 --> 01:56:36.18 Physical hardening.
01:56:36.18 --> 01:56:38.34 Here's some basic principles.
01:56:38.34 --> 01:56:42.58 Travel light, no papers include a high percentage of automatic weapons and concentrate
01:56:42.58 --> 01:56:45.90 a large proportion of them well-forward.
01:56:45.90 --> 01:56:50.02 The point should be heavily armed when I used to hear the Vietnam guys talking about they
01:56:50.02 --> 01:56:55.02 would move the machine gunners close to the point because you're expecting a contact
01:56:55.02 --> 01:56:56.02 front.
01:56:56.02 --> 01:56:58.02 That was the kind that became the SOP.
01:56:58.02 --> 01:57:03.02 Well, not all time, but it was we used all time in our body.
01:57:03.02 --> 01:57:06.02 JP, almost always had Mikey up there.
01:57:06.02 --> 01:57:07.02 Why?
01:57:07.02 --> 01:57:11.42 JP's on point needs that cover fire.
01:57:11.42 --> 01:57:13.74 Approach streams gingerly.
01:57:13.74 --> 01:57:16.78 The Japs like streams best for their ambushes.
01:57:16.78 --> 01:57:22.02 Make sure that the point has grenades in his hand when he starts across it.
01:57:22.02 --> 01:57:23.02 Damn.
01:57:23.02 --> 01:57:26.02 That's freaking fired up.
01:57:26.02 --> 01:57:31.54 Don't pause for any reason until both banks have been well-scattered in both directions.
01:57:31.54 --> 01:57:36.58 Select successive reorganization points as the patrol progresses down the trail to provide
01:57:36.58 --> 01:57:40.58 for swift reorganization.
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:43.62 Manuver swiftly on first contact.
01:57:43.62 --> 01:57:48.26 Jap ambushes, and Jap ambush weapons are not normally cited to cover wide fields of
01:57:48.26 --> 01:57:52.14 fire and usually bare mainly on the trail.
01:57:52.14 --> 01:58:05.50 Select wise the Japs react poorly to an attacker who makes an axe on his decisions quickly.
01:58:05.50 --> 01:58:09.42 And yes, obviously I'm using the term Jap here.
01:58:09.42 --> 01:58:16.06 I know it's an offensive term, but this is the literature of this time period.
01:58:16.06 --> 01:58:18.34 And they're not talking about the Japanese people.
01:58:18.34 --> 01:58:23.70 They're talking about the Imperial Japanese Army and military who they were fighting to the
01:58:23.70 --> 01:58:25.90 death.
01:58:25.90 --> 01:58:27.90 Infantry.
01:58:27.90 --> 01:58:31.14 Control is hard to maintain in squad's platoons and companies when operating in the woods,
01:58:31.14 --> 01:58:36.38 connecting groups are soon lost from sight and sound as necessary that particular attention
01:58:36.38 --> 01:58:42.98 be directed by all commanders from the squad leader on up to maintain control of their
01:58:42.98 --> 01:58:46.78 forces and contact with adjacent units.
01:58:46.78 --> 01:58:52.14 The individual must know the location of his immediate superior and his CP at all time.
01:58:52.14 --> 01:58:58.22 And this is the last thing from this particular volume, fighting spirit.
01:58:58.22 --> 01:59:04.46 It was notable that until such time as the infantry got fighting mad, there was a carefree
01:59:04.46 --> 01:59:07.38 attitude among the troops.
01:59:07.38 --> 01:59:15.22 In training this mad spirit can be developed to a certain degree.
01:59:15.22 --> 01:59:18.94 The use of cover and advancing by creeping and crawling must be stressed.
01:59:18.94 --> 01:59:31.42 It is necessary to emphasize the importance of the live soldier as compared to the dead hero.
01:59:31.42 --> 01:59:34.78 Emphasize the importance of the live soldier as compared to the dead hero.
01:59:34.78 --> 01:59:44.08 And that's sort of a dichotomy between that and fighting mad and fighting mad and staying
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:46.08 focused.
01:59:46.08 --> 01:59:48.000 And they call that fighting spirit.
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000 So there you go.
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.68 Lessons being learned over and over again.
01:59:57.68 --> 02:00:04.48 You would think that you would think that the things that we talk about, the things that
02:00:04.48 --> 02:00:10.32 we teach, the things that we teach to, the military, the things that we teach to, the business
02:00:10.32 --> 02:00:14.36 world, the things that we teach to law enforcement, you would think that the things that
02:00:14.36 --> 02:00:23.36 we teach, which we are literally reading from the book, that's whatever, 70 years old.
02:00:23.36 --> 02:00:27.000 You would think that people would just be like, hey bro, what are you trying to teach?
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.68 We are, this is your teach the most obvious things ever.
02:00:29.68 --> 02:00:30.76 We don't need you.
02:00:30.76 --> 02:00:35.04 You would think that we wouldn't have a business.
02:00:35.04 --> 02:00:36.68 But we do.
02:00:36.68 --> 02:00:39.12 Oddly enough.
02:00:39.12 --> 02:00:46.40 There's something, there's a force that draws people in the wrong direction.
02:00:46.40 --> 02:00:50.60 And, and, well, should I say there's forces?
02:00:50.60 --> 02:00:56.96 There's forces that draw you in the wrong direction, forces of ego, the forces of lack of
02:00:56.96 --> 02:00:59.28 perspective.
02:00:59.28 --> 02:01:06.04 There's another force in addition to those forces that I talked about earlier, what
02:01:06.04 --> 02:01:08.64 ego perspective and what emotion.
02:01:08.64 --> 02:01:11.96 The ego perspective and detachment.
02:01:11.96 --> 02:01:20.20 The other one, the other, the fourth thing that draws people down is complacency and
02:01:20.20 --> 02:01:25.88 just weakness, just taking the easy bath.
02:01:25.88 --> 02:01:29.40 Those are the four, those are the four things that mess us up.
02:01:29.40 --> 02:01:35.000 There's a four-flag to the stool.
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:42.000 There's a race and suit, emotion or emotion slash detachment.
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.16 Yeah.
02:01:44.16 --> 02:01:47.16 These are the things that draw people down.
02:01:47.16 --> 02:01:50.16 ego.
02:01:50.16 --> 02:01:55.96 You and I have been talking about ego, abunchly.
02:01:55.96 --> 02:02:00.60 It just so happens that that's been the topic of our most recent series of conversations,
02:02:00.60 --> 02:02:02.32 whether it's EF Online or just EF Online or just EF.
02:02:02.32 --> 02:02:05.60 It ego just happened to be on the forefront.
02:02:05.60 --> 02:02:11.92 As you're talking, the work in place, it was just ringing in my head.
02:02:11.92 --> 02:02:20.44 As thinking, as you said, it's not that it's a separate thing, but your ego will get out
02:02:20.44 --> 02:02:22.04 of control when you're complacent.
02:02:22.04 --> 02:02:23.04 Absolutely.
02:02:23.04 --> 02:02:25.92 And if your ego is out of control, you'll get complacent.
02:02:25.92 --> 02:02:26.92 Totally.
02:02:26.92 --> 02:02:35.04 And then if you just think you're just going to detach from emotion and just you get complacent
02:02:35.04 --> 02:02:37.92 about your ability to do that, you will get sucked in.
02:02:37.92 --> 02:02:43.44 And if you want to actually see it from other people's points of view and go, how let
02:02:43.44 --> 02:02:45.48 look if I say this?
02:02:45.48 --> 02:02:50.76 If you get complacent and understand it was just the way you put that word under all
02:02:50.76 --> 02:02:55.96 through those things of that triangle, it's the complacency that is why you don't apply
02:02:55.96 --> 02:02:56.88 those three things.
02:02:56.88 --> 02:03:00.48 And we can jot everyone at just the way you're saying it in my mind.
02:03:00.48 --> 02:03:07.28 It was when I don't keep my ego and my ego mechanism isn't working.
02:03:07.28 --> 02:03:09.72 Because I'm being complacent with, oh, I'm humble.
02:03:09.72 --> 02:03:10.72 I'm a humble guy.
02:03:10.72 --> 02:03:11.72 Dave's humble.
02:03:11.72 --> 02:03:12.72 I know how to keep my ego in check.
02:03:12.72 --> 02:03:14.80 And then when I tell myself, I can do that.
02:03:14.80 --> 02:03:16.20 My ego gets out of control.
02:03:16.20 --> 02:03:26.84 Yeah, complacency is an underlying symptom and cause of these three things that keep
02:03:26.84 --> 02:03:30.32 us in business, bro.
02:03:30.32 --> 02:03:32.12 They keep us in business right on.
02:03:32.12 --> 02:03:34.16 All right, echo Charles.
02:03:34.16 --> 02:03:37.76 Just we kind of close out talking about fighting spirit.
02:03:37.76 --> 02:03:38.76 Thanks for your.
02:03:38.76 --> 02:03:39.76 Yeah.
02:03:39.76 --> 02:03:42.96 Any suggestion on how we can keep our our fighting spirit up.
02:03:42.96 --> 02:03:44.96 Keep the fighting spirit up.
02:03:44.96 --> 02:03:46.76 Yes.
02:03:46.76 --> 02:03:47.76 The path.
02:03:47.76 --> 02:03:48.76 That's what I'm talking about.
02:03:48.76 --> 02:03:49.76 Okay.
02:03:49.76 --> 02:03:52.44 So, in our on our path.
02:03:52.44 --> 02:03:55.000 And we all have individual paths by the way.
02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.08 I'm overlapping elements, of course, fitness, mental and physical.
02:04:01.08 --> 02:04:09.24 If you're not at the very least maintaining, but hopefully we're working to move to progress
02:04:09.24 --> 02:04:10.64 mentally physically.
02:04:10.64 --> 02:04:13.000 Physically, that's a big one.
02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.04 Once you get married, well, you know, you got your career in order to face it, that complacency
02:04:19.04 --> 02:04:21.96 on the mental and the physical home front.
02:04:21.96 --> 02:04:28.000 You can, by the way, if you don't have physical health there, you're in a real bad way
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000 in every way.
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:33.84 Yeah, but mentally spiritually emotionally, it's all going downhill.
02:04:33.84 --> 02:04:36.28 So we want to maintain as much physical health as we can.
02:04:36.28 --> 02:04:38.08 Is that kind of where we're going.
02:04:38.08 --> 02:04:39.28 That is true.
02:04:39.28 --> 02:04:44.12 But I think that the kind of the perception is that that hill that you're talking about
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:46.04 go downhill, that's a big hill.
02:04:46.04 --> 02:04:47.80 It's like it's like long.
02:04:47.80 --> 02:04:52.44 And then when you're like younger, potentially at the top of that hill, but the hill is so
02:04:52.44 --> 02:04:58.52 long that you can let these things slide for so long that on the way down, you kind of
02:04:58.52 --> 02:05:02.52 know, yeah, sure, I'm letting my health kind of slide, but it's not like code read.
02:05:02.52 --> 02:05:05.56 It doesn't feel like code read for like a long time.
02:05:05.56 --> 02:05:08.32 Rome wasn't built in the day and it wasn't destroyed in a day either.
02:05:08.32 --> 02:05:09.32 There you go.
02:05:09.32 --> 02:05:14.12 They go day by day, but then one point you look up and the infrastructures hurt hurting.
02:05:14.12 --> 02:05:16.80 And you're like, the infrastructure might not be recoverable.
02:05:16.80 --> 02:05:17.80 That's what I'm seeing.
02:05:17.80 --> 02:05:18.80 Yeah, that's the problem.
02:05:18.80 --> 02:05:24.48 And that is kind of one of those points that I think doesn't for some reason doesn't
02:05:24.48 --> 02:05:26.76 don't upon us real obviously.
02:05:26.76 --> 02:05:31.68 No, that's because it creeps in, creeps in a little bit at a time.
02:05:31.68 --> 02:05:36.72 But you kind of would think, like on paper or whatever, that like you could get to the
02:05:36.72 --> 02:05:39.84 point, you could at least predict, okay, look, I'm going downhill.
02:05:39.84 --> 02:05:40.84 I get it.
02:05:40.84 --> 02:05:43.24 This is how many never single day by the way.
02:05:43.24 --> 02:05:50.56 I get it, but when I get to XYZ point, I know that that's not recoverable or I'm in bill
02:05:50.56 --> 02:05:52.92 super hot water or whatever.
02:05:52.92 --> 02:05:58.24 So let's when it gets to here, let's really tighten it up really, but we don't really
02:05:58.24 --> 02:05:59.24 do that.
02:05:59.24 --> 02:06:00.24 Well, we hope we do.
02:06:00.24 --> 02:06:02.24 Yeah, we hope we do.
02:06:02.24 --> 02:06:08.60 Let's not get it, let's not let it get to the point and something that can, that allows
02:06:08.60 --> 02:06:13.000 us to let it slide more is you got some kind of like your finger a little being
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000 up, right?
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.76 Maybe those joints are family with their fingers.
02:06:17.76 --> 02:06:20.48 That's one of the things.
02:06:20.48 --> 02:06:25.92 Well, and actually that reminds me of what I was thinking, sure, yes, we would like if you
02:06:25.92 --> 02:06:33.68 work hard, work out hard, true, you'd like to be doing single beating, but even like daily
02:06:33.68 --> 02:06:37.92 doing the same thing every day, sitting down, every day, like all that kind of stuff,
02:06:37.92 --> 02:06:39.68 it jams up your joints as well.
02:06:39.68 --> 02:06:44.28 Did you know that if you sleep with your knees together on your side, it kind of like puts
02:06:44.28 --> 02:06:46.32 weird pressure like on your hips and your knees?
02:06:46.32 --> 02:06:47.32 I did not know that.
02:06:47.32 --> 02:06:50.72 Yeah, that's what I found out.
02:06:50.72 --> 02:06:51.72 Anyway, whatever.
02:06:51.72 --> 02:06:53.32 All right, joint, stop off your work.
02:06:53.32 --> 02:06:54.32 There you go.
02:06:54.32 --> 02:06:55.32 We need supplementation.
02:06:55.32 --> 02:06:56.32 We're in the game.
02:06:56.32 --> 02:06:57.32 We are working out.
02:06:57.32 --> 02:06:58.72 If you're not working out, it's like man.
02:06:58.72 --> 02:07:00.72 Right, you got to start working out.
02:07:00.72 --> 02:07:01.72 Have to.
02:07:01.72 --> 02:07:02.72 Definitely.
02:07:02.72 --> 02:07:09.60 Unless your job is even then, even if you have the most physical job you can think
02:07:09.60 --> 02:07:15.20 of, we know what you have to do, proactively do mobility, stretch.
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:16.20 You know what I'm saying?
02:07:16.20 --> 02:07:17.20 Pro soccer player.
02:07:17.20 --> 02:07:18.84 Well, then again, no, if you're pro athlete, you are working out.
02:07:18.84 --> 02:07:19.84 That's your whole jam.
02:07:19.84 --> 02:07:21.000 So yeah, okay, you're correct.
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.60 I agree with that 100%.
02:07:22.60 --> 02:07:23.60 Okay, so work out.
02:07:23.60 --> 02:07:25.76 If you're not working out, we're working out now.
02:07:25.76 --> 02:07:28.80 And you will need, very young levels of supplementation.
02:07:28.80 --> 02:07:29.80 Let's start from the bottom.
02:07:29.80 --> 02:07:32.80 The foundational supplementation joints.
02:07:32.80 --> 02:07:34.80 Keep those in the game.
02:07:34.80 --> 02:07:35.80 You're not getting younger.
02:07:35.80 --> 02:07:37.16 I know you heard it before.
02:07:37.16 --> 02:07:39.76 It seems obvious, but we don't act like it's sometimes.
02:07:39.76 --> 02:07:40.76 Same.
02:07:40.76 --> 02:07:41.76 You get older.
02:07:41.76 --> 02:07:42.76 Like I joined.
02:07:42.76 --> 02:07:44.16 I joined conversation just with yourself.
02:07:44.16 --> 02:07:48.68 Because I know the thought that's why, you know how someone's like, hey, I'm not
02:07:48.68 --> 02:07:49.68 getting any younger.
02:07:49.68 --> 02:07:53.84 It's like, yeah, Brad, that literally applies to every single human being at any age.
02:07:53.84 --> 02:07:55.000 You could be just born.
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.36 You're still not getting any younger.
02:07:56.36 --> 02:07:57.36 You know what I'm saying?
02:07:57.36 --> 02:07:58.36 I don't know, though, bro.
02:07:58.36 --> 02:08:00.96 Also you are getting some people are getting into the question.
02:08:00.96 --> 02:08:06.12 But like, don't you think, hey, I'm better in these following nine aspects right now than
02:08:06.12 --> 02:08:07.12 I was last year.
02:08:07.12 --> 02:08:08.12 That's true.
02:08:08.12 --> 02:08:09.12 I think I'm getting younger.
02:08:09.12 --> 02:08:12.000 No, see, you lost me at the last part.
02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.96 You might be getting better.
02:08:13.96 --> 02:08:14.96 For sure.
02:08:14.96 --> 02:08:16.88 More mobile, more physical, whatever.
02:08:16.88 --> 02:08:21.92 But, nonetheless, what I'm saying is sometimes these cliches or super self-explanatory,
02:08:21.92 --> 02:08:23.80 like obvious to everyone or whatever.
02:08:23.80 --> 02:08:27.80 So that I say, I'm then I gotta explain what I mean by, I'm just saying, because they apply.
02:08:27.80 --> 02:08:30.000 I'm saying, all right.
02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.04 Anyway, take to it in my forefare and super-cruil oil.
02:08:33.04 --> 02:08:36.24 Keep your joints in the game because weak joints is worse than weak strength.
02:08:36.24 --> 02:08:37.24 You understand that?
02:08:37.24 --> 02:08:38.24 Yeah.
02:08:38.24 --> 02:08:40.04 Because you don't even have the capability to understand it.
02:08:40.04 --> 02:08:41.04 I said I understand it.
02:08:41.04 --> 02:08:43.04 That means you didn't need to understand it.
02:08:43.04 --> 02:08:44.04 I don't know.
02:08:44.04 --> 02:08:45.04 Oh, really?
02:08:45.04 --> 02:08:46.04 You did.
02:08:46.04 --> 02:08:47.04 I'm looking at David and Sammy think.
02:08:47.04 --> 02:08:50.04 So I figured I was compelled to explain it a little bit more.
02:08:50.04 --> 02:08:54.44 Then the way he pulls show that I noded my head, which is every bit the same as saying,
02:08:54.44 --> 02:08:57.04 I understand it.
02:08:57.04 --> 02:09:00.04 Just here, guys, words are it not tells me that you don't fully understand it.
02:09:00.04 --> 02:09:02.04 I'm trying to give to you guys.
02:09:02.04 --> 02:09:04.64 So you got joint warfare, criminal, discipline, discipline, go.
02:09:04.64 --> 02:09:06.64 Vitamin D3, cold war.
02:09:06.64 --> 02:09:07.84 We got the RTD.
02:09:07.84 --> 02:09:08.84 You can drink.
02:09:08.84 --> 02:09:11.84 Okay, where you at Dave Burke.
02:09:11.84 --> 02:09:17.28 What's your flavor assessment at the current time of the cans of discipline go?
02:09:17.28 --> 02:09:18.28 Serafless Labyrinth.
02:09:18.28 --> 02:09:19.28 That's your number one.
02:09:19.28 --> 02:09:20.28 Number one.
02:09:20.28 --> 02:09:21.28 Okay, just came out.
02:09:21.28 --> 02:09:22.28 Okay.
02:09:22.28 --> 02:09:24.28 So Charles, where are you at?
02:09:24.28 --> 02:09:26.92 I'm gonna be honest.
02:09:26.92 --> 02:09:29.52 I like the jockel Palmer taste the best.
02:09:29.52 --> 02:09:33.12 But how you go and routines among the Serafless Labyrinth,
02:09:33.12 --> 02:09:34.76 sour apple, sniper.
02:09:34.76 --> 02:09:39.12 I think maybe subconsciously, I'm still in the novel phase.
02:09:39.12 --> 02:09:40.80 You know, like little flavors, same thing.
02:09:40.80 --> 02:09:45.12 But I think taste wise, jockel Palmer edge, like by a little bit.
02:09:45.12 --> 02:09:49.20 When is your signature flavor coming out?
02:09:49.20 --> 02:09:50.20 Good deal, Dave Burke.
02:09:50.20 --> 02:09:51.84 It's next man.
02:09:51.84 --> 02:09:53.20 So we have slapped the table.
02:09:53.20 --> 02:09:55.12 We are official on the flavor.
02:09:55.12 --> 02:09:56.88 Did you get the flavor that you liked?
02:09:56.88 --> 02:09:58.48 We did.
02:09:58.48 --> 02:09:59.92 And now it's production time.
02:09:59.92 --> 02:10:00.52 It is time.
02:10:00.52 --> 02:10:01.52 The cans are ordered.
02:10:01.52 --> 02:10:02.92 Oh, the cans are ordered.
02:10:02.92 --> 02:10:03.48 Official.
02:10:03.48 --> 02:10:06.20 And I'd be a little, I had the talk last week.
02:10:06.20 --> 02:10:08.12 And I think we're next.
02:10:08.12 --> 02:10:10.48 So I actually, no, I saw the can design.
02:10:10.48 --> 02:10:12.56 Did you post the can design?
02:10:12.56 --> 02:10:13.92 I think I repost it from him.
02:10:13.92 --> 02:10:14.92 The every time.
02:10:14.92 --> 02:10:17.12 Like this is like Pete's dream.
02:10:17.12 --> 02:10:23.64 Every time Pete gets to design a cool can, he like just, that's, that's, he's so happy.
02:10:23.64 --> 02:10:24.96 He was super fired up on this.
02:10:24.96 --> 02:10:25.96 Exactly.
02:10:25.96 --> 02:10:26.96 Dude.
02:10:26.96 --> 02:10:27.96 I was super excited.
02:10:27.96 --> 02:10:28.96 When he said that stuff, I was so stoked.
02:10:28.96 --> 02:10:29.96 He did that.
02:10:29.96 --> 02:10:30.96 He was so cool.
02:10:30.96 --> 02:10:31.96 And he's like, bro, yeah, totally.
02:10:31.96 --> 02:10:33.96 Why is Jocco such a freaking show, Beth?
02:10:33.96 --> 02:10:36.96 Yeah, I'm feeling Pete totally unknown.
02:10:36.96 --> 02:10:36.96 Because you're going to fire up your, you know, your artistically, you're like, oh, man,
02:10:36.96 --> 02:10:37.96 this one really came together.
02:10:37.96 --> 02:10:38.96 You know, there's layers in there.
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:55.96 You show it to like your primary audience and they just are like, cool.
02:10:55.96 --> 02:10:59.96 Bro, why don't we come to you sometimes?
02:10:59.96 --> 02:11:00.96 Hey, warning order.
02:11:00.96 --> 02:11:01.96 You know what, warning order is.
02:11:01.96 --> 02:11:05.96 Means like, hey, we got an operation that's going to be coming up.
02:11:05.96 --> 02:11:08.96 Pretty soon in the southeast.
02:11:08.96 --> 02:11:09.96 Sure.
02:11:09.96 --> 02:11:11.96 A store called Wawa.
02:11:11.96 --> 02:11:12.96 Wawa, yep.
02:11:12.96 --> 02:11:13.96 I hear good things.
02:11:13.96 --> 02:11:16.96 They're going to be having discipline go there.
02:11:16.96 --> 02:11:21.96 Little warning order that when it comes, go get some.
02:11:21.96 --> 02:11:22.96 Mm.
02:11:22.96 --> 02:11:23.96 We're on a little mission.
02:11:23.96 --> 02:11:27.96 Uh, milk, protein that tastes good.
02:11:27.96 --> 02:11:28.96 Yep.
02:11:28.96 --> 02:11:29.96 Or dessert that has protein.
02:11:29.96 --> 02:11:31.96 Yeah, I'm not sure which way you want to describe it.
02:11:31.96 --> 02:11:32.96 Either way, it's good with me.
02:11:32.96 --> 02:11:33.96 Sure.
02:11:33.96 --> 02:11:35.96 Jocco white tea.
02:11:35.96 --> 02:11:36.96 Yeah.
02:11:36.96 --> 02:11:37.96 Good.
02:11:37.96 --> 02:11:38.96 Good.
02:11:38.96 --> 02:11:39.96 Good product.
02:11:39.96 --> 02:11:44.96 And this stuff is also available at the vitamin shop.
02:11:44.96 --> 02:11:51.96 Or at origin main.com, which way you can also get due to products, such as a geek,
02:11:51.96 --> 02:11:53.96 such as a rash card.
02:11:53.96 --> 02:11:56.96 And by the way, just don't not just ugly.
02:11:56.96 --> 02:11:58.96 Kind of get vuggie.
02:11:58.96 --> 02:12:01.96 You can kind of get vuggie that you want.
02:12:01.96 --> 02:12:04.96 The most comfortable geek ever made.
02:12:04.96 --> 02:12:05.96 Rift.
02:12:05.96 --> 02:12:06.96 Yeah.
02:12:06.96 --> 02:12:07.96 Is there a more comfortable geek even rift?
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:08.96 Negative.
02:12:08.96 --> 02:12:09.96 It's not even in the same ballpark.
02:12:09.96 --> 02:12:10.96 Yeah.
02:12:10.96 --> 02:12:12.96 It was funny because my son he's for like I mentioned before.
02:12:12.96 --> 02:12:17.96 So he'll like just be brand like we're not training any place and nothing like that.
02:12:17.96 --> 02:12:19.96 But he'll randomly be like, hey,
02:12:19.96 --> 02:12:21.96 it's time to train.
02:12:21.96 --> 02:12:22.96 Yeah.
02:12:22.96 --> 02:12:24.96 Or at the very least put on put on like he.

02:13:06.96 --> 02:13:08.96 But they're not made there anymore.
02:13:08.96 --> 02:13:10.96 Unless you get origin jeans.
02:13:10.96 --> 02:13:13.96 And then they're made in America.

02:16:00.96 --> 02:16:03.96 We have a YouTube channel where echo Charles makes videos.
02:16:03.96 --> 02:16:07.96 If they're short, really compact videos, then they'll have all kinds of
02:16:07.96 --> 02:16:08.96 excitement in them.
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:12.96 If they're in long video, then there'll be no excitement in them.
02:16:12.96 --> 02:16:16.96 We'll just be people talking, which in echo Charles's opinion is the way to do it.
02:16:16.96 --> 02:16:17.96 It's valuable.
02:16:17.96 --> 02:16:20.96 Everyone else doesn't think that, but it's echo Charles's YouTube channel.
02:16:20.96 --> 02:16:22.96 That's what he, that's where he's at.

02:16:33.96 --> 02:16:35.96 Troopers since day one.
02:16:35.96 --> 02:16:39.96 If we don't have explosions, if that's not part of the program,
02:16:39.96 --> 02:16:41.96 something's wrong.

02:17:16.96 --> 02:17:18.96 We got a book called the code.
02:17:18.96 --> 02:17:19.96 Dave Burke.
02:17:19.96 --> 02:17:20.96 Good one.
02:17:20.96 --> 02:17:21.96 What do you got about the code?
02:17:21.96 --> 02:17:24.96 Still using the code every day.
02:17:24.96 --> 02:17:30.96 I am, I still get more direct messages and social media about that than anything else.
02:17:30.96 --> 02:17:36.96 Because it was this idea of like, hey, you just have this conversation.
02:17:36.96 --> 02:17:39.96 You have to look at the, you want to not be complacent.
02:17:39.96 --> 02:17:44.96 You want to keep, you have to do it every single day, every single day.
02:17:44.96 --> 02:17:49.96 I thought what you're going to say is, will we also talked about, you got to know where you are.
02:17:49.96 --> 02:17:53.96 This book, the code, the evaluation of protocols actually allows you to assess where you are.
02:17:53.96 --> 02:17:56.96 How can you move if you don't know where you are?
02:17:56.96 --> 02:17:57.96 The answers you can't.
02:17:57.96 --> 02:18:03.96 The code, the evaluation of protocols written by jocca will link Dave Burke and Sarah Armstrong.
02:18:03.96 --> 02:18:04.96 You know what's funny about that?
02:18:04.96 --> 02:18:08.96 The code, like, elements from this book are now in my everyday life.
02:18:08.96 --> 02:18:13.96 Like my whole, you don't remember how it feels like back in the day, but let's just face it.
02:18:13.96 --> 02:18:18.96 Kind of the current, you know how you, like label your experience from one to ten.
02:18:18.96 --> 02:18:19.96 Right.
02:18:19.96 --> 02:18:20.96 Give it a score one to ten now.
02:18:20.96 --> 02:18:21.96 It's one to five.
02:18:21.96 --> 02:18:22.96 Oh, it changed your whole.
02:18:22.96 --> 02:18:25.96 Yeah, five is like the unattainable perfection.
02:18:25.96 --> 02:18:29.96 You know, four is like your general perfection, you know?
02:18:29.96 --> 02:18:31.96 Yeah, you got to be careful with that one though.
02:18:31.96 --> 02:18:32.96 The fours?
02:18:32.96 --> 02:18:35.96 Yeah, because if your, if your wife is like, hey, how do I look tonight in this dress?
02:18:35.96 --> 02:18:37.96 And you're like, oh, you're a five.
02:18:37.96 --> 02:18:40.96 What you mean is unattainable perfection.
02:18:40.96 --> 02:18:41.96 Yes.
02:18:41.96 --> 02:18:42.96 What you get is slapped.
02:18:42.96 --> 02:18:43.96 Yeah.
02:18:43.96 --> 02:18:44.96 What you get forward that one.
02:18:44.96 --> 02:18:45.96 Here's the thing.
02:18:45.96 --> 02:18:48.96 When you get really used to this evaluation system, I'll get slapped.
02:18:48.96 --> 02:18:49.96 I got it.
02:18:49.96 --> 02:18:50.96 I got to stay true to the code.
02:18:50.96 --> 02:18:51.96 Got it.
02:18:51.96 --> 02:18:54.96 You know, you're kids are doing some results or whatever.
02:18:54.96 --> 02:18:56.96 They're getting a 1, 2, 3 or 4.
02:18:56.96 --> 02:18:56.96 Yeah.
02:18:56.96 --> 02:18:58.96 Maybe sometimes five if it's perfect.
02:18:58.96 --> 02:19:01.96 But I'm just saying the whole rating system gets shifted down to this one now.
02:19:01.96 --> 02:19:02.96 Cool.
02:19:02.96 --> 02:19:03.96 And the same standard as well.
02:19:03.96 --> 02:19:07.96 Like five, like you'll, all you've been taxed like, hey, just through up a four.
02:19:07.96 --> 02:19:10.96 If I get Dave, if I text you, head, just through up a four, right?
02:19:10.96 --> 02:19:12.96 You know exactly what I'm talking about.
02:19:12.96 --> 02:19:13.96 Impressive.
02:19:13.96 --> 02:19:16.96 Seems like I'm just saying this code is life now.
02:19:16.96 --> 02:19:18.96 Also, I've leadership strategy in attack is field manual.
02:19:18.96 --> 02:19:22.96 Way of the warrior kid, one, two and three, Mikey in the dragons, discipline.

02:19:31.96 --> 02:19:37.96 Dave, what do you spearheading right now?
02:19:37.96 --> 02:19:42.96 I think we are working with like 20 different companies on language programs right now.
02:19:42.96 --> 02:19:46.96 I think everyone from a different sector, a different place in the market.
02:19:46.96 --> 02:19:50.96 And you said something you made it ago.
02:19:50.96 --> 02:19:54.96 It's the same exact thing with every company.
02:19:54.96 --> 02:20:00.96 But everything is different because they're all different and not one single thing about it is boring.
02:20:00.96 --> 02:20:02.96 I'm it.
02:20:02.96 --> 02:20:04.96 My wife would tell you that I repeat myself a thousand times a day.
02:20:04.96 --> 02:20:07.96 I have not once gotten tired of it.
02:20:07.96 --> 02:20:12.96 And companies that working with us, the coolest thing about it is despite all the stuff going on in the world around.
02:20:12.96 --> 02:20:16.96 They are getting better and it is so awesome to be a part of that.

02:21:07.96 --> 02:21:16.96 Probably going to be social distancing. So we have less seats and people from Orlando and Phoenix are coming to Dallas.
02:21:16.96 --> 02:21:18.96 So it's going to sell out even quicker than normal.
