12
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.04
Major Butler was eminent and conspicuous in command of his battalion. He exhibited courage and skill

13
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:36.56
in leading his men through the action of the 22nd and in the final occupation of the city.

14
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:46.64
A awarded for action. The president of the United States of America in the name of Congress

15
00:01:46.64 --> 00:01:52.88
takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor second award to Major Smedley, Darlington Butler,

16
00:01:52.88 --> 00:01:58.80
United States Marine Corps for extraordinary heroism in action as commanding officer of

17
00:01:58.80 --> 00:02:06.40
detachments from the 15th, 13th, 23rd companies and the Marine and sailor detachment from the USS Connecticut.

18
00:02:07.92 --> 00:02:18.48
Major Butler led the attack on Fort Riviera, Haiti on 17 November 1915 following a concentrated

19
00:02:18.48 --> 00:02:24.72
drive several different detachments of Marines gradually closed in on an old French bastion

20
00:02:24.72 --> 00:02:29.60
fort in an effort to cut off all avenues of retreat for the Kaco bandits.

21
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:35.92
Reaching the fort on the southern side where there was a small opening in the wall,

22
00:02:35.92 --> 00:02:40.32
Major Butler gave the signal to attack and Marines from the 15th company,

23
00:02:40.32 --> 00:02:45.60
poured through the breach, engaged the Kaco's in hand to hand combat, took the bastion,

24
00:02:46.16 --> 00:02:52.48
and crushed the Kaco resistance. Throughout this perilous action,

25
00:02:52.48 --> 00:02:57.84
Major Butler was conspicuous for his bravery and forceful leadership.

26
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.96
So there you go. Major Smedley Butler United States Marine for 34 years.

27
00:03:12.32 --> 00:03:16.96
Fort in the Philippines, China, Central America, fought in the Caribbean during the banana wars,

28
00:03:16.96 --> 00:03:22.32
fought in World War I, although against his wishes he was more in support role.

29
00:03:23.76 --> 00:03:30.56
He's one of only 19 men in history to receive two medals of honor. He's one of only three men to

30
00:03:30.56 --> 00:03:37.60
receive the Marine Corps Brevei, metal, and the metal of honor. And he's the only man in history

31
00:03:37.60 --> 00:03:49.44
to receive two medals of honor and the Brevei metal. And with that career after he retired from

32
00:03:49.44 --> 00:03:59.28
the Marine Corps, he wrote a book called The War is a racket. You heard that right.

33
00:03:59.28 --> 00:04:07.36
The war is a racket. This is a book that harshly condemns war denounces the military

34
00:04:07.36 --> 00:04:14.56
industrial complex, vilifies the captains of industry and politicians along the way,

35
00:04:14.56 --> 00:04:19.60
and disparages Americans, America's foreign actions in war.

36
00:04:19.60 --> 00:04:29.76
So there's a bit of an about face going on. And these are some extreme views that he has.

37
00:04:30.72 --> 00:04:36.40
And when individuals make extreme statements, sometimes that's not the best approach to take,

38
00:04:37.12 --> 00:04:45.28
because sometimes extreme statements, though they may be true or parts of them may be true,

39
00:04:45.28 --> 00:04:55.76
it can also alienate the general populace and kind of lead people to throw the baby out with

40
00:04:55.76 --> 00:05:03.84
the bathwater on some stuff, meaning that they throw away someone's ideas, they throw away all

41
00:05:03.84 --> 00:05:09.60
of someone's ideas because some of the ideas that the person has or the way that they state them

42
00:05:09.60 --> 00:05:15.92
is an extreme manner, which is I personally don't think it's a good idea.

43
00:05:15.92 --> 00:05:20.08
Well, it's a good thing to understand. It's a good thing to understand because what that should

44
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:26.48
tell you is that if you back off the extremity of your statements a little bit, you're going

45
00:05:26.48 --> 00:05:31.12
to get more people to listen to them. So that's a good thing to understand. And it's also a good

46
00:05:31.12 --> 00:05:35.60
thing to understand that if people are talking in a really extreme way, you shouldn't just say,

47
00:05:35.60 --> 00:05:39.04
you know what, this person just crazy, I'm not going to listen to them. Maybe you should actually

48
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:45.36
listen to what they try and say and decipher what's just extreme and maybe not true, but are there

49
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:50.40
kernels of truth in what people are saying? So I think it's a smart idea for us to listen.

50
00:05:53.04 --> 00:05:57.84
And I think as we have watched America's

51
00:05:57.84 --> 00:06:07.92
withdraw from Afghanistan in the late summer of 2021, after 20 years of war, after thousands

52
00:06:07.92 --> 00:06:16.24
of lives, after trillions of dollars, then no progress. Maybe we should at least listen to

53
00:06:16.24 --> 00:06:23.04
what this marine major general, smithly but the most decorated marine that ever lived,

54
00:06:23.04 --> 00:06:28.24
maybe we should listen to some of what he has to say and see if there are some things in there

55
00:06:28.24 --> 00:06:35.36
that makes some sense. We have to get a little basic understanding of smithly butler,

56
00:06:35.36 --> 00:06:43.04
who he was, where he came from, born July 30, 1881, eldest of three sons father was a lawyer

57
00:06:43.04 --> 00:06:48.96
in a junk and a judge. He came from a good background. His grandfather was a congressman

58
00:06:48.96 --> 00:06:58.80
and his father was connected. He was a connected guy and smedly butler went to an exclusive

59
00:06:58.80 --> 00:07:02.64
private school which is sort of an east coast thing. I mean I guess they have them out on the

60
00:07:02.64 --> 00:07:07.52
west coast, but on the east coast is a bigger thing to have exclusive private schools. He went

61
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:12.96
to one called the Hav referred school. And so you kind of get this image, you know, you kind of get

62
00:07:12.96 --> 00:07:19.60
this image, okay, well, you know, he's this rich kid that went to this exclusive school and then

63
00:07:19.60 --> 00:07:26.48
you hear that he left school 38 days before his 17th birthday to enlist in the marine corps,

64
00:07:29.28 --> 00:07:34.88
which is I think we have to give him credit, right? We just have to say credit. That's pretty much

65
00:07:34.88 --> 00:07:41.92
what you say. Credit. He still got his diploma. They allowed him to graduate. He lied about his age.

66
00:07:41.92 --> 00:07:46.48
And gets commissioned to second lieutenant. So I don't know how he pulled that off.

67
00:07:47.52 --> 00:07:52.08
But this is back in the day man. There's no records. You're just showing up. How old are you? 23?

68
00:07:52.40 --> 00:07:57.84
I went to college. Whatever. People like, oh, okay. You know what I'm saying? This is back in the

69
00:07:57.84 --> 00:08:02.56
day. You're no. Isn't it the kind of or like your ID card is written in. Yeah. Like by hand. Yeah,

70
00:08:02.56 --> 00:08:08.40
you like change that one to a seven. You were good. Yeah, or you just make an adjustments. Yeah.

71
00:08:08.40 --> 00:08:14.72
So I feel like I missed out on a lot of stuff because I didn't have that kind of. I mean, we were close,

72
00:08:14.72 --> 00:08:21.28
you know, but we were just there were still tracking stuff. So he's 16 years old and he

73
00:08:21.28 --> 00:08:27.20
leaves his high school to go and join the marine corps. Show's up. Get to commission as a second lieutenant.

74
00:08:27.76 --> 00:08:31.44
And he's at the Spanish American war is going down. But he gets there a little late.

75
00:08:32.48 --> 00:08:36.24
Ends up showing up and get mo after it's been invaded. After it's been captured.

76
00:08:36.24 --> 00:08:43.36
Doesn't really see any combat gets assigned to the to the Philippine American war.

77
00:08:44.72 --> 00:08:47.76
He shows up there. He's bored at first.

78
00:08:49.36 --> 00:08:55.20
Get's in trouble. Get's temporarily temporarily relieved of command because he's drunk and doing

79
00:08:55.20 --> 00:09:02.16
whatever. Gets his job back. However, October 1899 he gets his first combat action.

80
00:09:02.16 --> 00:09:10.32
It leads 300 Marines in to take the town of Nova Letta. One Marines killed 10 of wounded. His first

81
00:09:10.32 --> 00:09:16.16
sergeant's company first sergeant's wounded. There's a little note about him like panicking at first,

82
00:09:16.16 --> 00:09:23.12
a little bit and then he kind of gets composure. And up in the box of rebellion.

83
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.96
So battle of chains in this is in China. He definitely kind of shows up now. There's a wounded

84
00:09:30.96 --> 00:09:38.32
Marine officer and he is in the trench. Smedly but there's an entrench and he exposes himself

85
00:09:38.32 --> 00:09:45.44
to enemy fire to rescue the Marine. He ends up getting shot in the thigh. His commanding officer

86
00:09:45.44 --> 00:09:51.20
made your woller who later became the best man in his wedding. He commended him and wrote

87
00:09:51.20 --> 00:09:57.60
for such reward as you may deem proper for the following officers. Lieutenant Smedly debutler

88
00:09:57.60 --> 00:10:03.44
for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week and for saving a wounded man

89
00:10:03.44 --> 00:10:09.04
at the risk of his own life under very severe fire. And that's what got turned into the

90
00:10:09.04 --> 00:10:17.12
brevet promotion, which the brevet, if my memory serves me correctly, the Marine Corps had it

91
00:10:17.12 --> 00:10:22.56
for like maybe 20 years and it basically was you're getting promoted. It was a promotion. So that's

92
00:10:22.56 --> 00:10:27.44
why even when I read it says, oh he went from from from from first lieutenant to captain. It was

93
00:10:27.44 --> 00:10:33.52
a promotion and then they people that got promoted that way. They eventually got an award called

94
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:39.76
the brevet medal, which looks like the ribbon of a medal of honor. The medal of honor has the

95
00:10:39.76 --> 00:10:46.000
white. It's a light blue. The brevet with the light blue with stars. The brevet is red with stars.

96
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.24
But it looks very similar as far as the ribbon goes. So he gets that promotion. He ends up in the banana

97
00:10:52.24 --> 00:11:02.40
wars. These are police actions. And these are police actions that we're conducting to maintain

98
00:11:02.40 --> 00:11:09.60
you know trade and and the way we want things to be. The way America wants things to be

99
00:11:09.60 --> 00:11:16.56
in Central America and in the Caribbean. Honduras rolls into Honduras. He gets tasked with defending

100
00:11:16.56 --> 00:11:22.000
the US consulant during a revolt there. He rescues the consulate in Trujillo. He gets this

101
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.72
nickname. His nickname is old Gimleti. Gimlet is a is a hand drill. It's something that it's a

102
00:11:30.72 --> 00:11:36.56
tool. It's an old school tool that used to drill wood. So he had this piercing look that he would

103
00:11:36.56 --> 00:11:45.12
give people. And they called him old Gimleti. Broken service gets out, gets married, has kids, runs a

104
00:11:45.12 --> 00:11:50.16
coal mine in West Virginia goes back in the Marine Corps. It must have been easy to get down in an

105
00:11:50.16 --> 00:11:55.04
out of the Marine Corps back then. He does it a couple times. More fighting in Central America,

106
00:11:56.88 --> 00:12:06.16
the Italian commander in in Nicaragua, fall in the battle of Mazaya, leads the assault,

107
00:12:06.16 --> 00:12:15.68
the bombardment, the assault, and the capture of Kuyoktepe Hill. Next up is Veracruz. These guys are

108
00:12:15.68 --> 00:12:22.80
he's rolling. They're getting it on with these low intensity conflicts. I remember one of my old

109
00:12:22.80 --> 00:12:27.52
senior chief said, what we need is a low intensity conflict in a high per day of Mariah.

110
00:12:29.52 --> 00:12:34.72
Which I always got a kick out of. So that's where he's got going on. These guys are low intensity

111
00:12:34.72 --> 00:12:39.36
conflict, high per day of Mariah. Mexico Veracruz first metal of honor. So they end up going through

112
00:12:39.36 --> 00:12:46.40
Veracruz that kind of clear-knit door to door. There's 5,800 sailors and Marines on this operation.

113
00:12:47.76 --> 00:12:57.84
17 kilodin action, 63 wounded in action. Which if you think about that, 5,800 sailors and marines

114
00:12:57.84 --> 00:13:02.96
are 17 kilodin. So the fighting, I'm trying to say that the fighting wasn't that extreme.

115
00:13:02.96 --> 00:13:16.08
But there was medals of honor given out. Pretty, pretty, a lot. So one army guy got a metal of honor.

116
00:13:16.08 --> 00:13:20.08
Nine Marines got a metal of honor and 46 Navy sailors got the metal of honor.

117
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:27.44
From this action of Veracruz. So he eventually tried to return the metal and said hey, I didn't

118
00:13:27.44 --> 00:13:30.32
do anything during this and they, not only did they tell them to keep it, they told them you

119
00:13:30.32 --> 00:13:35.12
better wear it too. So that's his first metal of honor. He didn't feel comfortable about it.

120
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:41.68
But he got it. Haiti, second metal of honor. Fighting the Haitian, the Kaco's rebels,

121
00:13:41.68 --> 00:13:46.64
the rebel group down there. And they have this stronghold he kind of heard me talk about it in the

122
00:13:47.92 --> 00:13:55.36
in the citation there. But he's getting the metal of honor. The whole battle was 20 minutes long.

123
00:13:55.36 --> 00:14:01.52
This assault. There was a one Marine wounded and he was wounded by being hit with a rock in the face.

124
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.76
All 51 of the rebels were killed. So he got the metal of honor for that.

125
00:14:12.64 --> 00:14:18.64
And that's what happened. After that he became like a public administrator or sort of sort of

126
00:14:18.64 --> 00:14:24.000
sort of the military, I don't know, many dictator kind of running things a little bit.

127
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.56
The public works and keep in things, you know, social order. And he also, it's also said that

128
00:14:28.56 --> 00:14:41.28
they hunted the remaining rebels like pigs. World War I comes around. He requests, he wants

129
00:14:41.28 --> 00:14:48.56
to come back again. He had a reputation of being brave. He had a reputation of being smart. He also

130
00:14:48.56 --> 00:14:59.28
had a reputation of being a little bit of a rebel, a little bit unreliable. And so I don't know if

131
00:14:59.28 --> 00:15:03.20
that's why they decided not to put him in combat because I'm thinking if World War I, they would

132
00:15:03.20 --> 00:15:07.84
have been like, oh yeah, you're just the guy we're looking for. He's brave, he's smart, but you're

133
00:15:07.84 --> 00:15:12.96
super crazy, come on up to the front line, we got something for you. But they didn't. He ended up

134
00:15:12.96 --> 00:15:19.52
running this debarcation depot, you know, in the rear. And the by all accounts, he did a great job

135
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:24.24
and squared this thing away. It was a real mess when he showed up and he squared it away.

136
00:15:25.28 --> 00:15:32.96
And he got the army in the Navy, distinguished service metal. After that, he goes and he's the

137
00:15:32.96 --> 00:15:39.20
commanding general, a quannico. When he was the commanding, this guy was always doing something.

138
00:15:39.20 --> 00:15:43.44
He's one of those people, he always was doing something. When he was the commanding general,

139
00:15:43.44 --> 00:15:49.84
a quannico, they used to form up the troops and they would march to various battle fields,

140
00:15:50.48 --> 00:15:58.80
civil war battle fields and do reenactments. And he would lead the marches. So yeah, I mean,

141
00:15:58.80 --> 00:16:05.04
he's just, they they march from quannico to damgettysburg, right? And he was in front, leading it.

142
00:16:05.04 --> 00:16:12.96
And they got up there. Let's do walk, get these burgers. So so then he's so gets done with that.

143
00:16:12.96 --> 00:16:19.60
Now he has a broken service and he becomes the Philadelphia director of public safety.

144
00:16:19.60 --> 00:16:27.60
And this is like, I need a movie reference here, echo Charles. What's the movie where they're like,

145
00:16:27.60 --> 00:16:35.68
gangsters, they're trying to crack down untouchables? Sure. Okay. So there's, this is the time,

146
00:16:35.68 --> 00:16:43.12
there's speak easy, is in the prohibition is going on. And he comes like law dog, right? He comes into,

147
00:16:43.12 --> 00:16:48.64
he has a personal war on crime for two years. And it seems like when you read about it,

148
00:16:48.64 --> 00:16:55.04
it seems like it's its own movie, right? This guy is going in just ready to take things on. He

149
00:16:55.04 --> 00:17:00.72
was, he wasn't allowed to fire. If I remember this correctly, he wasn't allowed, he found out he wasn't

150
00:17:00.72 --> 00:17:06.08
allowed to fire individual police because the union and whatever. So what he did was he just take and just

151
00:17:06.08 --> 00:17:10.96
move them all around all the time. So they didn't have, they didn't have time to get to know the

152
00:17:10.96 --> 00:17:14.72
local criminals to get paid off. He just moved them all the time. They were moving. That's like one of

153
00:17:14.72 --> 00:17:22.08
the things that he did. And he, he made a lot of enemies because of so many people are corrupt,

154
00:17:22.08 --> 00:17:26.72
made a bunch of enemies. He's fine. He gets kind a little bit. He did it does it for two years.

155
00:17:26.72 --> 00:17:32.64
He cleans up a lot of stuff, but also makes a bunch of enemies. His final shot in the papers

156
00:17:32.64 --> 00:17:37.52
before he went back in the Marine Corps. He's been cleaning up Philadelphia's worse than any

157
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:45.20
battle I was ever in. When he comes back in, he comes, comes the base commander in San Diego.

158
00:17:45.20 --> 00:17:52.80
Deployed with the Marine Expeditionary Force to China, does a good job there politically,

159
00:17:52.80 --> 00:17:59.76
influences a bunch of people, makes major general at 48 years old. And in that time also,

160
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:04.64
his dad died, his dad was super influential. He was like I said, he was always kind of,

161
00:18:05.60 --> 00:18:11.60
he was kind of had a spotlight put on one of the things when Mussolini's now in power. He,

162
00:18:11.60 --> 00:18:17.92
and there was some weird, like a conspiracy about Mussolini needed, hitting Ron or something like this,

163
00:18:18.48 --> 00:18:25.04
I forget, but he sort of spread those rumors. I think if he had Twitter, he would have been

164
00:18:25.04 --> 00:18:30.88
a real popular Twitter dude because he started spreading this guy, you know, this guy is a murderer.

165
00:18:33.92 --> 00:18:37.44
And the Italian government, this was before the war, the Italian government, it's like, hey,

166
00:18:37.44 --> 00:18:43.60
get, get your boy in check and they pressured the second half to court martial butter. And they did,

167
00:18:43.60 --> 00:18:50.40
they court martial butter. I think he was the highest ranking military person to be arrested

168
00:18:51.44 --> 00:18:56.72
after the Civil War. So he had arrested and he apologized, they let him off for the reprimand.

169
00:18:57.60 --> 00:19:02.80
The comment on the Marine Corps died at the time and he was kind of in the running and he ends up,

170
00:19:02.80 --> 00:19:09.68
it's pretty obvious that he's not enough of a company guy to get common done and he doesn't get it.

171
00:19:10.88 --> 00:19:18.56
So he retires from the Marine Corps October 1st, 1931. He starts going on like a lecture tour

172
00:19:20.32 --> 00:19:26.24
speaking and he gets paid for it. He donated a bunch of the pay that he gets for the unemployment

173
00:19:26.24 --> 00:19:32.72
relief. He runs for Senate. He loses. He supports the bonus army, which was when the World War

174
00:19:32.72 --> 00:19:39.52
won vets. They had these things called service certificates that they bought. And when they bought

175
00:19:39.52 --> 00:19:46.48
those things, they had, again, I'm sorry if this isn't perfect, but it was something along the lines

176
00:19:46.48 --> 00:19:54.16
of when you bought these things, they had like a 20 year maturity time on them. And the depression's

177
00:19:54.16 --> 00:19:59.68
going on and everyone's like, hey, we want that money and all these veterans, thousands and

178
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:03.68
thousands of veterans are saying, hey, we, we, we know we gave you that money. We bought those service

179
00:20:03.68 --> 00:20:08.72
certificates, which are like bonds. We want to cash them in now. And the government was like,

180
00:20:08.72 --> 00:20:13.44
hey, those are 20 years, man, you bought those in 19. You got to have another few years before

181
00:20:13.44 --> 00:20:18.56
you can cash those things in. And this is when they had all the big standoffs in the, you know,

182
00:20:18.56 --> 00:20:25.28
the World War I veterans marched down and set up camp in Washington, DC. And he supported that,

183
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.12
gave more speeches. Here's an example. This is when we know where he's had mentally, right?

184
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:41.76
I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean, we can see what his angle starts to become. This was,

185
00:20:41.76 --> 00:20:48.56
and this was a summary of one of his speeches that was published in socialist magazine. That was

186
00:20:48.56 --> 00:20:53.12
called common sense. It says, I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and

187
00:20:53.12 --> 00:20:59.92
during that period, I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for big business for Wall Street

188
00:20:59.92 --> 00:21:06.80
and the bankers. In short, I was a raccade tier, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico

189
00:21:06.80 --> 00:21:14.48
and especially Tampico, which is a city in Mexico, safe for American oil, as interests in 1914.

190
00:21:14.48 --> 00:21:20.16
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank Boys to collect revenues in.

191
00:21:20.16 --> 00:21:25.84
I helped in the raping of half a dozen central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street.

192
00:21:26.56 --> 00:21:33.68
I helped purify Nick or Wagua for the international banking house of brown brothers in 1902 to 1912.

193
00:21:33.68 --> 00:21:39.52
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interest in 1916. I helped

194
00:21:39.52 --> 00:21:45.68
make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927, I helped

195
00:21:45.68 --> 00:21:52.96
see to it that standard oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given

196
00:21:52.96 --> 00:21:59.44
Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was operate his racket in three districts. I operated

197
00:21:59.44 --> 00:22:11.20
on three continents. He's kind of pissed. 1934, again, this guy would have been all over Twitter.

198
00:22:12.32 --> 00:22:17.36
1934, he's sort of the leader of this thing that was called the business plot, which was this

199
00:22:18.72 --> 00:22:23.84
that there's this conspiracy that there was this plot for business leaders to overthrow

200
00:22:23.84 --> 00:22:35.84
President Roosevelt. In 1935, he wrote this book called War is a racket.

201
00:22:37.76 --> 00:22:46.16
Now, we're going to read it. Some of it's extreme. Some of it may be too extreme. Some of it's

202
00:22:46.16 --> 00:22:59.44
not accurate. Some of it's his feelings, his emotions. You know, when Colonel David Hacworth,

203
00:22:59.68 --> 00:23:08.48
when he went and talked to the press and you and I have had that discussion day of like

204
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:11.44
did he give up his influence? He could have been a division came out of Brigade Commander next

205
00:23:11.44 --> 00:23:19.20
in the division commander. I think people sometimes reach a point where they emotionally

206
00:23:20.88 --> 00:23:27.44
can't take it anymore. I think David Hacworth got there where he had seen enough American soldiers

207
00:23:27.44 --> 00:23:32.32
and he loved his soldiers and he loved all soldiers and he loved the army and just to see

208
00:23:33.52 --> 00:23:36.80
the soldiers being utilized in a way that he didn't think was to actually sound eventually.

209
00:23:36.80 --> 00:23:46.48
He just couldn't take anymore. And I think that Major General Smedley Butler got to a similar point.

210
00:23:48.40 --> 00:23:54.40
And of course, this is 1935. So I mean, we got hit learn power in 1933. So he sees,

211
00:23:54.40 --> 00:24:00.88
though he hears the war drums beating and as he sees the war drums beating, he doesn't like it.

212
00:24:00.88 --> 00:24:08.88
What do you thought so far, Dave? It's interesting to hear you recount some things that I

213
00:24:08.88 --> 00:24:14.24
remember, because obviously as a Marine, this is one of the characters in the history of the

214
00:24:14.24 --> 00:24:19.44
Marine Corps that you are given early on. So they give it, they give you Smedley Butler really

215
00:24:19.44 --> 00:24:23.28
on. Oh yeah. Is there, is there not risking that? Aren't they like, well,

216
00:24:24.24 --> 00:24:29.20
the weird thing was that we're at the metal of honors, right? Look, I'm in no position to be like,

217
00:24:29.20 --> 00:24:37.36
well, I'm not sure. But when 46 Navy sailors got a metal of honor and there's 17 kilodin action.

218
00:24:37.36 --> 00:24:46.80
Like that's a, that that seems very, that seems, that seems strange. Yeah. Right. For sure.

219
00:24:46.80 --> 00:24:52.000
Seems strange. And that's the, that's really kind of the point that I'm thinking about in my mind is,

220
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.80
you know, there's a little bit of a contrast. This is a guy that you will hear about. And certainly

221
00:24:58.80 --> 00:25:03.28
in, and listen, you could, I mean, I got to be careful with my words too, because I don't want

222
00:25:03.28 --> 00:25:06.48
there to be a negative connotation to it. But there's a, there's an indoctrination you go through

223
00:25:06.48 --> 00:25:12.08
in your Marine. And that indoctrination is, we're kind of awesome. And our history is pretty awesome.

224
00:25:12.08 --> 00:25:15.60
And we've got some amazing people that did some amazing things. And you start to think about who those

225
00:25:15.60 --> 00:25:20.08
people are. One of the things that's interesting about the name Smedley Butler is when you see the

226
00:25:20.08 --> 00:25:24.000
pictures of this guy. And like, you'll be in a class and it'll be about Marine Corps history. And they'll

227
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
literally have a slide or a picture up on the wall of the person. And he's not, he doesn't really

228
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.56
look like a, a, I guess. He looks like poster boy Marine. He looks like a guy named Smedley. He does.

229
00:25:36.56 --> 00:25:42.16
And that went to maybe a private school. This coast. And then, you know, you're, you're seeing

230
00:25:42.16 --> 00:25:46.56
basilone and you're seeing chesty and these pictures. And just the pictures alone are enough to be like,

231
00:25:46.56 --> 00:25:53.44
okay, this, this dude is legit. But, you know, they also, I don't have any recollection of

232
00:25:53.44 --> 00:25:58.88
the things that he did and the times that he did them and there awards. I don't ever remember

233
00:25:58.88 --> 00:26:03.28
being given sort of the other side of it is, hey, listen, there's a different time, different circumstances.

234
00:26:03.28 --> 00:26:08.000
So as I hear you talk about that and I'm listening to that, I just did some basic math, you know,

235
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.36
5,600 people and then you sort of did that W wounded and killed him like, well, I've seen that.

236
00:26:13.36 --> 00:26:18.40
I know what the middle or more of the other side of that looks like and those numbers are good numbers.

237
00:26:18.40 --> 00:26:23.04
You know, by by Sanders, like you said, this is probably not the most high intensity thing

238
00:26:23.04 --> 00:26:29.68
that that that that marines have been through. But the other side is is this is also, I'm

239
00:26:29.68 --> 00:26:33.84
literally, you just say he's 40 years old as a major general. This guy went back in the Marine Corps twice.

240
00:26:33.84 --> 00:26:39.36
This guy had a left high school and by rights, kind of probably just coasted on a pretty easy life.

241
00:26:40.40 --> 00:26:46.96
So you're kind of forced to reconcile and remind that I think to maybe the whole point of this podcast

242
00:26:46.96 --> 00:26:52.96
is that I probably need to listen to what he has to say. But yeah, no, he's, he is one of

243
00:26:52.96 --> 00:26:56.80
the characters that and I'm using that term just, you know, to illustrate that we are introduced

244
00:26:56.80 --> 00:27:02.08
to historic marines that have had impact in history and that's someone that we know about for sure.

245
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:09.28
We could probably do a whole podcast about awards and whatnot, but I forget what year,

246
00:27:09.28 --> 00:27:13.20
like the bronze star and the silver star, it wasn't, they didn't have those yet at this time.

247
00:27:13.20 --> 00:27:16.56
Yeah. And so this was, if you were going to get an award, it was going to be the metal of water.

248
00:27:16.56 --> 00:27:24.16
And there you go. Again, it's, it's like crazy because you got this guy that has two metal,

249
00:27:24.16 --> 00:27:29.52
two metals of honor and this Marine Corps prevent thing, which there's, there's not many of those things

250
00:27:29.52 --> 00:27:36.96
handed out either. It's a tiny number. And, and also the type of combat that they were going into,

251
00:27:36.96 --> 00:27:43.60
I mean, this is pre-World War I, it's the combat that he's talking about. So combat was totally different

252
00:27:43.60 --> 00:27:49.52
between, you know what, I mean, you got the silver war, we knew what combat was, but, but,

253
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:54.88
yeah, there've been, there've been a generation maybe that was a little bit,

254
00:27:55.84 --> 00:27:59.20
that that hadn't quite been there. Yeah, and I think the sense that I've always had

255
00:28:00.56 --> 00:28:06.56
was that that when you think of conflict or you think of combat and you think of World War I,

256
00:28:06.56 --> 00:28:11.92
it has a very strong sense of organized conflict between two well-established, well-organized

257
00:28:11.92 --> 00:28:18.72
size, a size that have design and structure and and components that you can almost align against each other.

258
00:28:18.72 --> 00:28:24.000
And that, certainly for World War I, produces probably like the most heavy intensity of conflict.

259
00:28:24.56 --> 00:28:29.92
Whereas before that, you have this sense of this well-organized team, the United States Navy,

260
00:28:29.92 --> 00:28:34.000
the United States Marine Corps, the organization of those two working together, we're, we're going

261
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.76
to get you to the beach, you're going to embark and you're going to, or, or debark and get onto the

262
00:28:37.76 --> 00:28:44.000
land, and we're going to support you and, but the, the people you're in conflict with, you don't have

263
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.92
that level of organization. So when you said, you know, one wounded on the good side in 57

264
00:28:49.92 --> 00:28:55.28
kiln, I'm like, I can, and again, I should be careful wounded by a rock, but you can picture that,

265
00:28:55.28 --> 00:29:00.08
like, this is a lot cited scenario. And it doesn't mean that that weren't incredibly brave

266
00:29:00.08 --> 00:29:04.80
actions that didn't happen to, it's solicit that outcome, but when you think of World War I,

267
00:29:04.80 --> 00:29:08.72
or World War II, or really conflicts we've had since then that organized versus organized,

268
00:29:08.72 --> 00:29:12.72
you don't get those sense of that long period of, of Marine Corps history, and those are all in

269
00:29:12.72 --> 00:29:17.84
Marine Corps history. We, we learn about all those things, but you don't get a sense of this

270
00:29:17.84 --> 00:29:21.84
force on force conflict that were in the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

271
00:29:22.24 --> 00:29:26.000
World War I, World War II, we're going against someone that's pretty much like we are.

272
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.88
Professionally trained professionally outfitted and prepared for for this type of conflict.

273
00:29:30.88 --> 00:29:37.76
Check. So he writes his book wars a racket and people people, I, I don't know, I've had this book for five years.

274
00:29:38.80 --> 00:29:42.88
In fact, I couldn't even find, I have two copies of it, and I haven't, I wouldn't be able to find them.

275
00:29:42.88 --> 00:29:48.88
So you can get this thing on PDF. And the reason I couldn't find them is because the moving scenario,

276
00:29:48.88 --> 00:29:53.68
I'm going to come up there and sell my books or in big giant boxes. And I was like, it's time to do it.

277
00:29:53.68 --> 00:29:57.36
And yeah, what, what makes it time to do it, because, well, one of the things that just

278
00:29:57.36 --> 00:30:05.60
totally provoked me was a trillion dollar price tag on Afghanistan and thousands of lives lost.

279
00:30:06.16 --> 00:30:12.16
And you're thinking, hold on a second. Who, what was, what was the overall goal here?

280
00:30:12.16 --> 00:30:16.88
What we're doing? Because if I, I could spend a trillion dollars and do literally anything,

281
00:30:17.92 --> 00:30:24.40
you can maybe a trillion dollars, a trillion dollars. You're telling me you couldn't square away a

282
00:30:24.40 --> 00:30:32.56
country with a trillion dollars and 20 years. And basically an unlimited supply of people and assets.

283
00:30:32.56 --> 00:30:39.84
It's crazy. So what was going on? So as I'm thinking about that, here I am, a guy that supports

284
00:30:39.84 --> 00:30:46.72
the military that is very patriotic. And I'm thinking, who spends a trillion dollars?

285
00:30:47.92 --> 00:30:53.60
And it doesn't, doesn't get the job done. How does that happen? Who are you? What are you thinking

286
00:30:53.60 --> 00:31:00.24
about? What is your ultimate goal? And that very quickly, my mind very quickly jumped on,

287
00:31:00.24 --> 00:31:03.04
oh, this is probably what's medley, smelly, but now I'd read wars a racket.

288
00:31:04.08 --> 00:31:08.88
I was always kind of like, yeah, well, yeah, I mean, that's one way of looking at it, right?

289
00:31:08.88 --> 00:31:14.64
So let's look at it. Here we go. Chapter one, wars a racket. It always has been.

290
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:21.60
It's possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only

291
00:31:21.60 --> 00:31:28.08
one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars

292
00:31:28.08 --> 00:31:36.80
and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it

293
00:31:36.80 --> 00:31:43.60
seems to be to the majority of the people. Only a small inside group knows what it's about.

294
00:31:43.60 --> 00:31:53.04
It is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the very many out of war,

295
00:31:53.04 --> 00:32:01.68
a few people make huge fortunes. Okay. If we're just going to fact check this thing as we go,

296
00:32:02.96 --> 00:32:08.48
so far we are factual, right? That's what a racket is, right? A racket is something where a

297
00:32:08.48 --> 00:32:12.08
couple of people kind of know what's going on, everything else is getting fooled. A couple of people

298
00:32:12.08 --> 00:32:16.32
inside are going to make a bunch of money. Other people are kind of going to get screwed. That's what's

299
00:32:16.32 --> 00:32:27.52
going to happen. In war, there are people that make a lot of money. He calls it the World War because

300
00:32:27.52 --> 00:32:34.32
there was only one at the time. In the World War, a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict.

301
00:32:34.96 --> 00:32:40.000
At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the

302
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:48.24
World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains, or sorry, that many admitted their huge blood

303
00:32:48.24 --> 00:32:55.20
gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their tax returns?

304
00:32:55.20 --> 00:33:02.40
No one knows. Okay. So a lot of people made a lot of money in the world. I just saw an article that

305
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:13.28
there's several billion dollars in taxes that are avoided by the top 1% earners in this country.

306
00:33:13.84 --> 00:33:19.68
So other people that are doing things to get around taxes, yes. Where are there people that were

307
00:33:19.68 --> 00:33:25.44
made into millionaires and billionaires after September 11th? Yes, there were.

308
00:33:25.44 --> 00:33:37.04
Next, how many of these war millionaires shoulder to rifle? How many of them dug a trench?

309
00:33:37.04 --> 00:33:42.88
How many of them knew what it meant to go hungry in a rat and fested dug out? How many of them

310
00:33:42.88 --> 00:33:47.84
spent sleepless, frightened nights, ducking shells and shrapnel and machine gun bullets?

311
00:33:47.84 --> 00:33:56.64
How many of them parried a bayonet thrust of an enemy? How many of them were wounded or killed

312
00:33:56.64 --> 00:33:57.20
in battle?

313
00:34:01.44 --> 00:34:04.24
Ratorical questions that I think we all know the answer to.

314
00:34:07.92 --> 00:34:08.56
Not many.

315
00:34:08.56 --> 00:34:19.12
Out of war, nations acquire additional territory. If they are victorious, they just take it.

316
00:34:19.12 --> 00:34:27.12
This newly acquired territory is exploited by the few. The self-same few who run dollars out

317
00:34:27.12 --> 00:34:31.36
of blood in the war. The general public shoulders the bill.

318
00:34:31.36 --> 00:34:44.80
Fact check. Kind of negative on this one. I mean America speaking of America,

319
00:34:44.80 --> 00:34:54.32
we have kind of our established what we have territory was and we haven't taken any new territory

320
00:34:54.32 --> 00:35:04.88
in recent wars. That's not been our goal. Even the idea that oh, it's going in there to take the oil.

321
00:35:04.88 --> 00:35:07.68
We don't actually go in and take the oil. It hasn't happened.

322
00:35:14.40 --> 00:35:19.12
And what is the bill? This bill renders a horrible accounting.

323
00:35:19.12 --> 00:35:27.76
Newly placed gravestones, mangled bodies, shattered minds, broken hearts and homes,

324
00:35:27.76 --> 00:35:31.84
economic instability, depression and all its attendant miseries,

325
00:35:32.96 --> 00:35:36.96
backbreaking taxation for generations and generations.

326
00:35:42.32 --> 00:35:43.12
Factual feature.

327
00:35:43.12 --> 00:35:48.000
Horrible accounting.

328
00:35:53.20 --> 00:35:57.68
And taxation to pay for these wars for generations.

329
00:36:01.20 --> 00:36:05.12
For a great many years as a soldier, I had a suspicion that war was a racket.

330
00:36:06.24 --> 00:36:09.12
Not until I retired to civil life that I fully realized it.

331
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:15.84
Now that I see the international war clouds gathering as they are today, I must face it and speak out.

332
00:36:17.28 --> 00:36:21.04
And again, that's because he's looking at world war two. What you call the war clouds.

333
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:28.48
Again, they are choosing sides. France and Russia met and agreed to stand by side by side.

334
00:36:28.48 --> 00:36:32.24
Italy and Austria are hurried to make a similar agreement. Poland and Germany cast

335
00:36:32.24 --> 00:36:39.44
cast, cast sheep's eyes at each other, forgetting for the nons their dispute over the Polish quarter.

336
00:36:40.24 --> 00:36:46.48
And to look what nons was. It means like a one time deal.

337
00:36:47.36 --> 00:36:50.88
Just hey, we're just going to forget about our dispute over here because we're going to be friends right now.

338
00:36:53.84 --> 00:36:59.04
The assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia complicated matters. Yugoslavia and Hungary,

339
00:36:59.04 --> 00:37:04.08
Hungary, long bitter enemies were almost at each other's throats. Italy was ready to jump in,

340
00:37:04.08 --> 00:37:08.08
but France was waiting. So it was Czechoslovakia. All of them are looking ahead to war.

341
00:37:09.04 --> 00:37:16.64
Not the people. Not those who fight and pay and die, only those who foment wars and remain

342
00:37:16.64 --> 00:37:19.60
safely at home to profit.

343
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:33.12
What are you got? You get a fact check that. No, no, no, no.

344
00:37:33.12 --> 00:37:39.92
Yeah, yeah. I'm kind of sitting here listening to you talk, which is his word.

345
00:37:39.92 --> 00:37:43.28
You read this before? No, I have not. So that's why this is like a it's hard.

346
00:37:43.28 --> 00:37:46.48
Is it hard? And so I'm not wrote down a bunch of different notes.

347
00:37:46.48 --> 00:37:50.40
The last one I just wrote down was was just literally the word angry.

348
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.32
I don't think you're trying to convey that emotion on purpose. It's literally the words that you are

349
00:37:56.32 --> 00:38:02.80
reading. If you just if you try to put yourself in his shoes and I was just kind of recounting.

350
00:38:02.80 --> 00:38:07.04
We were talking about low intensity conflict and maybe the things that happened up until prior to

351
00:38:07.04 --> 00:38:13.76
warmer one. And I did think of something after I was talking a minute ago about the word low

352
00:38:13.76 --> 00:38:20.40
intensity conflict. I do remember the first time I was shot at like for real. And

353
00:38:21.52 --> 00:38:26.32
there's a moment when you're the one who is you know the victim or the potential victim here

354
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:29.92
it feels like World War III because when you're the one being shot it doesn't really matter

355
00:38:29.92 --> 00:38:34.16
the scope of what's going around you. That sends things like, oh damn, those people are trying

356
00:38:34.16 --> 00:38:40.24
to kill me and they're actually pretty darn close. You don't say, well, you know, in the grand scheme

357
00:38:40.24 --> 00:38:44.32
of historical things this is a very low intensity conflict and this particular engagement isn't.

358
00:38:44.32 --> 00:38:48.16
You don't think like that you think, okay, this is a big deal. There's a huge deal. And then

359
00:38:49.28 --> 00:38:54.40
with you, if you observe that and you're in his shoes and you lead up to the Travis deal over

360
00:38:54.40 --> 00:39:01.28
one, I'm just trying to be empathetic to the level of frustration you would have at the hands of

361
00:39:01.28 --> 00:39:05.28
a few number of decision makers both military and civilian by the way when we talk about

362
00:39:05.28 --> 00:39:12.08
over one. It's not hard for me to try to understand that as he said, I'm just almost pictureing

363
00:39:12.08 --> 00:39:18.000
him writing this down and just the frustration and the anger that he has and how clearly that's

364
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.24
coming through and hearing you say his, the words that he's saying that it's hard not to get a sense

365
00:39:24.24 --> 00:39:29.20
of his frustration. And you've even talked about how hard this is it when you just kind of boil over,

366
00:39:29.20 --> 00:39:34.32
you're not able to really even articulate yourself. I don't mean to say correctly, but

367
00:39:34.32 --> 00:39:37.92
the way that you would normally want to when you can keep your emotions in check.

368
00:39:37.92 --> 00:39:43.60
Yeah. Which you can't. Yeah, I know you got to you found it very interesting when we did,

369
00:39:43.60 --> 00:39:47.76
when we talked about being a child heart, just the fact like once you realized he was in the

370
00:39:47.76 --> 00:39:53.04
battle of the song, you're like, oh, got it. Okay. So this guy has a totally different perspective

371
00:39:53.04 --> 00:40:02.08
which is completely grounded and and fermented in what he experienced on the battlefield. And yeah,

372
00:40:02.08 --> 00:40:07.84
this is, uh, yeah, it's definitely, it's definitely a similar, a similar deal.

373
00:40:10.08 --> 00:40:15.12
Moving on, there are 40 million men under arms in the world today. So this again, this is 1935.

374
00:40:15.12 --> 00:40:20.96
And our statesmen and diplomats have the temerity to say that war is not in the making.

375
00:40:21.84 --> 00:40:25.60
Hell's bells are these 40 million men being trained to be dancers.

376
00:40:26.96 --> 00:40:31.52
Not immediately to be sure. Premier Moosellini knows what they are being trained for.

377
00:40:31.52 --> 00:40:36.72
He, at least, is frank enough to speak out. Only the other day, he'll do J in international

378
00:40:36.72 --> 00:40:43.60
consolation, the publication of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said quote,

379
00:40:43.60 --> 00:40:49.76
and above all, fascism, the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity

380
00:40:49.76 --> 00:40:56.56
quite apart from political considerations of the moment believes neither in the possibility nor the

381
00:40:56.56 --> 00:41:04.72
utility of perpetual peace. War alone brings up to its highest tension, all human energy and

382
00:41:04.72 --> 00:41:10.24
puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it. And quote,

383
00:41:14.80 --> 00:41:22.000
that's a, it's one thing for Ronald Reagan to say peace through strength and hey, we've got

384
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.88
to be strong and we've got to, you know, the best way to avoid war is to be prepared for it.

385
00:41:26.88 --> 00:41:32.40
But when you got Moosellini to say, hey, there's, I don't believe in the possibility or the

386
00:41:32.40 --> 00:41:39.60
or the freaking utility of peace. War alone brings to its highest tension, all human energy,

387
00:41:41.12 --> 00:41:44.80
and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it.

388
00:41:45.76 --> 00:41:48.64
That's the leader of your country. Guess what's happening? You're going to war in a war.

389
00:41:48.64 --> 00:41:56.32
On doubtily, Moosellini means exactly what he says. His well-trained army, his great fleet of

390
00:41:56.32 --> 00:42:03.04
planes, and even his navy are ready for war, anxious for it, apparently. His recent stand at the

391
00:42:03.04 --> 00:42:08.56
side of Hungary in the latter's dispute with Yugoslavia showed that, and the hurried mobilization

392
00:42:08.56 --> 00:42:13.76
of troops on the Austrian border after the assassination of Dolphus showed it too.

393
00:42:13.76 --> 00:42:21.76
There are others in Europe who's saber-rattling, presages, war, sooner or later.

394
00:42:22.48 --> 00:42:28.08
Paritler, with his rearming Germany and his constant demands for more and more arms,

395
00:42:28.08 --> 00:42:33.12
is an equal if not greater metastopiece. France only recently increased the turn of military

396
00:42:33.12 --> 00:42:39.68
service for its youth from a year to 18 months. All this stuff is going on, he's just tracking it.

397
00:42:39.68 --> 00:42:43.36
He sees everybody's head and head in the war.

398
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:52.000
Yes, all over nations are camping in their arms. The mad dogs of Europe are on the loose. In the

399
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.12
Orient, the maneuvering is more a joy. Back in 1904, when Russia and Japan fought, we kicked our

400
00:42:57.12 --> 00:43:03.44
old friends, the Russians, and back to PAN. Then our very generous international bankers were financing

401
00:43:03.44 --> 00:43:09.12
Japan. Now the trend is too poison us against the Japanese. What does the open door policy

402
00:43:09.12 --> 00:43:15.76
to China mean to us? Our trade with China is about $90 million a year. Or the Philippine Islands.

403
00:43:15.76 --> 00:43:22.56
We have spent about $600 million in the Philippines in 35 years. And we, our bankers and industrialists

404
00:43:22.56 --> 00:43:27.04
and speculators, have private investments there of less than $200 million.

405
00:43:29.84 --> 00:43:34.96
Then to save China, to save that China trade of about $90 million and to protect these private

406
00:43:34.96 --> 00:43:40.80
investments of less than 200 in the Philippines, we would all be stirred up to hate Japan and go to war.

407
00:43:40.80 --> 00:43:46.64
A war that might well cost us tens of billions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of American

408
00:43:46.64 --> 00:43:53.04
lives, and many more hundreds of thousands of physically maimed and mentally unbalanced men.

409
00:43:56.72 --> 00:44:01.36
Of course, for this loss, there would be a compensating profit. Forchants would be made,

410
00:44:01.36 --> 00:44:10.08
millions and billions of dollars would be piled up by a few. Munitions makers, bankers, ship builders,

411
00:44:10.08 --> 00:44:14.96
manufacturers, meat packers, speculators, they would fare well.

412
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:23.76
Yes, they are getting ready for another war. Why shouldn't they? They pay high dividends.

413
00:44:25.44 --> 00:44:29.60
But what does it profit the men who are killed? What does it profit their mothers and sisters?

414
00:44:29.60 --> 00:44:34.48
Their wives and their sweethearts? What does it profit their children? What does it profit?

415
00:44:34.48 --> 00:44:43.84
Anyone except the very few to whom war means huge profits? Yes, and what does it profit the nation?

416
00:44:43.84 --> 00:45:00.64
So, I kind of have my thoughts on all this that I'm going to say a little bit.

417
00:45:03.04 --> 00:45:11.04
What's the, I would say the methodology of the argument that he's presenting is to show

418
00:45:11.04 --> 00:45:21.20
one side of the argument, which is a good argument. You can't really come out this argument.

419
00:45:21.20 --> 00:45:24.72
You can't say, well, people aren't going to make money. People make money. That's what happens.

420
00:45:31.04 --> 00:45:36.16
And that by itself is it automatically a bad thing either? That's true. That's the other part.

421
00:45:36.16 --> 00:45:40.000
That's what I'm saying because there's, I know you've got thoughts on this. You're not going to be careful.

422
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.92
I could probably chime in like I usually do an every single thing that says, there's thoughts going through my head.

423
00:45:43.92 --> 00:45:49.60
Crazy. Yes. I mean, there are profit here and there are people that profit.

424
00:45:49.60 --> 00:45:53.28
And if I'm using the terms correctly, you can distinguish between those two.

425
00:45:53.28 --> 00:46:00.000
Right. And they can be aligned for sure. I mean, it's easy for me to sit here on retrospect,

426
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.60
but it's like, hey, Hitler, Mussolini? Yeah, we probably want to go to all those people.

427
00:46:03.60 --> 00:46:07.60
Yeah. Now, not let them do what they want. That's not a good plan.

428
00:46:07.60 --> 00:46:14.24
And I know this now sitting here looking back. But you're right. And I think to your point,

429
00:46:15.04 --> 00:46:21.44
his perspective is correct. It's not the whole story, but it's a perspective that what he sees

430
00:46:21.44 --> 00:46:26.80
and the way he's presenting it is correct. Yes. It's just that there is more tears more. And as

431
00:46:26.80 --> 00:46:32.48
you said, there's nothing more obvious than that than a guy named Edolph Hitler. Right. That's about to go

432
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:37.76
on a tear and kill millions of people. And it's interesting he's using him like, hey, he might be worse than

433
00:46:37.76 --> 00:46:42.72
this other guy. Yeah, he might be. Yeah, in 1935, he didn't seem so bad compared to Mussolini.

434
00:46:43.92 --> 00:46:46.48
He's going to give a little example. It's simply to take our own case.

435
00:46:47.36 --> 00:46:52.40
Until until 1898, we didn't own a bit of territory outside the mainland of North America.

436
00:46:52.40 --> 00:46:56.40
At that time, our national debt was little more than a billion dollars. Then we became

437
00:46:56.40 --> 00:47:01.44
internationally minded. We forgot or shunted aside the advice of the father of our country.

438
00:47:01.44 --> 00:47:06.40
We forgot George Washington's warning about entangling alliances. We went to war.

439
00:47:06.80 --> 00:47:12.16
We acquired outside territory at the end of the World War period. As a direct result of our

440
00:47:12.16 --> 00:47:17.36
fiddling and international affairs, our national debt had jumped to over 25 billion.

441
00:47:19.52 --> 00:47:24.72
Our total favorable trade balance during the 25-year period was about 24 billion.

442
00:47:24.72 --> 00:47:31.12
Therefore, on a purely bookkeeping basis, we ran a little behind year for year,

443
00:47:31.12 --> 00:47:35.52
and that foreign trade might as well have been ours without the wars.

444
00:47:38.48 --> 00:47:41.52
Again, when you just look at the numbers, run the numbers,

445
00:47:42.96 --> 00:47:48.16
man, we were a billion dollars and that debt and now we're 25 billion dollars and debt, that hurts.

446
00:47:48.16 --> 00:47:55.68
It would have been far cheaper not to say safer for the average American who pays the bills

447
00:47:55.68 --> 00:48:01.12
to stay out of foreign entanglements. For a very few this racket like bootlegging and other

448
00:48:01.12 --> 00:48:07.36
underworld rackets brings fancy profits, but the cost of operations is always transferred to the

449
00:48:07.36 --> 00:48:12.72
people who do not profit. And now we get into chapter two, who makes the profits.

450
00:48:12.72 --> 00:48:20.88
The World War, rather our brief participation in it, has cost the United States some $52 billion

451
00:48:20.88 --> 00:48:27.12
figured out. That means $400 to every American man, woman, and child. And we haven't paid the debt yet.

452
00:48:27.12 --> 00:48:32.56
We are paying it. Our children will pay it and our children's children probably still will be paying

453
00:48:32.56 --> 00:48:38.32
the cost of that war. The normal profits of a business concern in the United States are 6,

454
00:48:38.32 --> 00:48:44.96
8, 10 and sometimes 12 percent. But wartime profits. Ah, that is another matter.

455
00:48:44.96 --> 00:48:53.36
20, 60, 100, 300 and even 1,800 percent. The sky is the limit. All that traffic will bear.

456
00:48:53.36 --> 00:49:01.04
Uncle Sam has the money. Let's get it. Of course, it isn't put that crudely in wartime.

457
00:49:02.56 --> 00:49:07.04
It is dressed into speeches about patriotism, love of country, and quote,

458
00:49:07.04 --> 00:49:14.08
we must all put our shoulders to the wheel. But the profits jump and leap and skyrocket

459
00:49:14.72 --> 00:49:18.96
and our safely pocketed. Let's just take a few examples. Take our friends, the DuPontz, the

460
00:49:18.96 --> 00:49:24.48
powder people. Didn't warn them testified before a Senate committee recently that their powder

461
00:49:24.48 --> 00:49:29.60
won the war or saved the world or saved the world for democracy or something. How did they do in

462
00:49:29.60 --> 00:49:35.68
the war? They were a patriotic corporation. Well, the average earnings of the DuPontz for the period

463
00:49:35.68 --> 00:49:42.40
of 1910 to 1914 was $6 million a year. It wasn't much, but the DuPontz managed to get along.

464
00:49:43.28 --> 00:49:47.52
Now let's look at their average dearly profit during the war years, 1914 to 1918.

465
00:49:48.64 --> 00:49:56.56
$58 million a profit a year we find. Nearly 10 times that of normal times and the profits of normal

466
00:49:56.56 --> 00:50:01.76
times were pretty good. An increase of profits more than 950 percent.

467
00:50:01.76 --> 00:50:09.12
Take one of our little steel companies that patrioticly shunted aside the making of rails and

468
00:50:09.12 --> 00:50:15.52
girders and bridges to manufacture war materials. Well, their 1910 to 1914 yearly earnings average

469
00:50:15.52 --> 00:50:20.80
$6 million then came the war. And like loyal citizens, Bethlehem steel promptly turned to

470
00:50:20.80 --> 00:50:28.32
mission munitions making. Did their profits jump or did they let Uncle Sam in for a bargain?

471
00:50:28.32 --> 00:50:35.04
Well, their 1914 to 1918 average was $49 million a year. Or let's take United Steel.

472
00:50:35.04 --> 00:50:39.60
Normal earnings during the five-year period prior to the war were $105 million a year, not bad.

473
00:50:40.72 --> 00:50:45.44
Then came along the war and up with the profits. The average yearly profit for the period

474
00:50:45.44 --> 00:50:51.68
1914 to 1918 was $240 million, not bad. Then you have some of the steel and powder earnings.

475
00:50:52.24 --> 00:50:57.84
Let's look at something else. A little copper perhaps. That always does well in wartimes

476
00:50:57.84 --> 00:51:02.88
and a condo for instance. Average yearly earnings during the previous pre-year wars of 1910 to

477
00:51:02.88 --> 00:51:10.64
1914 to 1918. During the war, you wore years, 1914 to 1918. Prophets left to $34 million a year.

478
00:51:10.64 --> 00:51:16.96
You talk copper. average of $5 million during the pre-war period. Jump to an average of 21 million

479
00:51:16.96 --> 00:51:23.52
yearly profits for the war period. Let's group these five with three similar companies. The total

480
00:51:23.52 --> 00:51:32.56
yearly average profits of the pre-war period 1910 to 1914 were $137 million. Then came along the war.

481
00:51:32.56 --> 00:51:39.68
The average yearly profits for this group skyrocketed to $408 million. A little increase in profits

482
00:51:39.68 --> 00:51:47.12
of approximately 200%. There's war pay. They paid them. But they aren't the only ones. They're

483
00:51:47.12 --> 00:51:54.40
still others. Let's take leather. For three-year period, before the war, the total profit of

484
00:51:54.40 --> 00:52:02.24
central leather company were $3.5 million. That was approximately $1.16 million a year. Well,

485
00:52:02.24 --> 00:52:08.88
in 1916 central leather returned to profit of $15 million. Small increase of 1,100%. That's all.

486
00:52:09.44 --> 00:52:14.96
A general chemical company averaged a profit for three years before the war of a little over

487
00:52:14.96 --> 00:52:21.12
$800,000 a year. Came the war and profits jumped to $12 million a year. I'll leave a $1,400.

488
00:52:21.12 --> 00:52:25.36
International nickel company. You can't have a war without nickel. Show it an increase in profits

489
00:52:25.36 --> 00:52:33.12
from a mere $4 million a year to $73 million a year. Not bad. An increase of $1,700.

490
00:52:33.12 --> 00:52:37.52
American sugar refining company averaged $2 million a year for three years before the war in

491
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:44.88
the 1916 a profit of $6 million was recorded. Listen to Senate document number 259,

492
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:50.56
the 65th Congress reporting on corporate earnings and government revenues, considering the

493
00:52:50.56 --> 00:52:57.12
profits of 122 meat packers, 153 cotton manufacturer, 299 garment makers, 49 steel plants,

494
00:52:57.12 --> 00:53:05.12
340 coal producers during the war. Profits under 25% were exceptional. For instance, the coal

495
00:53:05.12 --> 00:53:13.28
companies made between 100% and 7,800% on their capital stock during a war. The Chicago Packers

496
00:53:13.28 --> 00:53:17.52
doubled and tripled their earnings. Let us not forget the bankers who financed the great war.

497
00:53:17.52 --> 00:53:22.64
If anyone had the cream of the profits, it was the bankers. Being partnerships rather than

498
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:26.24
incorporated organizations, they did not have to report to stockholders and their profits

499
00:53:27.52 --> 00:53:32.72
were as secret as they were immense. How the bankers made their millions and billions. I do not

500
00:53:32.72 --> 00:53:38.48
know because those little secrets never become public even before a Senate investor, investor,

501
00:53:38.48 --> 00:53:51.12
retiree body. People make money. Part of that is supply and demand. One of the reasons

502
00:53:51.12 --> 00:53:56.24
that America does so well during war is because we have capitalism and that's how we're able

503
00:53:56.24 --> 00:54:05.52
to outprose other countries, especially companies that have socialized or communist controlled

504
00:54:06.56 --> 00:54:11.68
industry. They just can't do what we do. Why? Because they're not driven to do it. There's no,

505
00:54:11.68 --> 00:54:17.36
hey, look, I'm running this factory for whatever for the Soviet Union. They want me to make 100

506
00:54:17.36 --> 00:54:20.56
tanks. They want me to make 200 tanks. I'm going to get the same paycheck. Regardless.

507
00:54:20.56 --> 00:54:27.60
And if I'm a guy, whatever, working on the fabrication of one of those tank trades, I don't

508
00:54:27.60 --> 00:54:32.72
care if I make 20 today or if I make 100 today, I'm going to get the same paycheck.

509
00:54:33.92 --> 00:54:37.44
So these people are going to make a lot of money because they're going to turn out

510
00:54:38.16 --> 00:54:48.64
something that is in high demand. Here's how some other patriotic industrialists and speculators

511
00:54:48.64 --> 00:54:54.32
chiseled their way into war profits. Take the shoe people. They like war. It brings business with

512
00:54:54.32 --> 00:54:59.92
abnormal profits. They made huge profits and sales abroad to our allies. Perhaps like the

513
00:54:59.92 --> 00:55:05.36
munitions manufacturers and armament makers, they also sold to the enemy. For a dollar as a

514
00:55:05.36 --> 00:55:10.16
dollar weather comes from Germany or from France. But they did well by Uncle Sam too. For instance,

515
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:18.56
they sold Uncle Sam 35 million pairs of hobnailed service shoes. So that's a big number

516
00:55:18.56 --> 00:55:25.76
there were 4 million soldiers, 8 pairs or more to a soldier. My regiment during the war had only

517
00:55:25.76 --> 00:55:30.56
one pair to soldier. Per soldier. Some of these shoes probably are still in existence. They were

518
00:55:30.56 --> 00:55:36.96
good shoes. But when the war was over, Uncle Sam has a matter of 25 million pairs of shoes left over,

519
00:55:36.96 --> 00:55:41.60
bought and paid for a profits recorded and pocketed. And this is, you know, you start getting

520
00:55:41.60 --> 00:55:46.56
into the idea of just like the government waste and it's just the crazy, crazy government waste.

521
00:55:46.56 --> 00:55:54.16
Which is why the free market is so powerful because people try and streamline things.

522
00:55:55.36 --> 00:55:59.20
There was a lot of leather left so the leather people sold your Uncle Sam hundreds of thousands

523
00:55:59.20 --> 00:56:04.48
of McLeodland saddles for the cavalry. But there wasn't any American cavalry overseas.

524
00:56:04.48 --> 00:56:09.36
Somebody had to get rid of this leather, however, somebody had to make a profit in it so we had a lot

525
00:56:09.36 --> 00:56:16.16
of McLeodland saddles. We probably still do. Also, somebody made a lot of mosquito netting. They sold

526
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:21.76
Uncle Sam 20 million mosquito nets for the use of soldiers overseas. I suppose the boys were expected

527
00:56:21.76 --> 00:56:26.08
to put it over them as they tried to sleep and muddy trenches. One hand scratching kudies on their

528
00:56:26.08 --> 00:56:31.68
backs and the others making passes at scurrying rats. Well, not one of these mosquito nets ever got to

529
00:56:31.68 --> 00:56:37.20
France. Anyhow, these thoughtful manufacturers wanted to make sure that no soldier would be

530
00:56:37.20 --> 00:56:42.48
without his mosquito net. So 40 million additional yards in mosquito netting were sold, Uncle Sam.

531
00:56:42.48 --> 00:56:49.76
You know why? Because you're not spending your own money. You're not spending your own money.

532
00:56:49.76 --> 00:56:55.36
You're not spending your own money, man. You spend it on stuff. Because it's really easy to

533
00:56:55.36 --> 00:57:02.48
you know what they might need them. No, let's get them. And all politics are local and who knows

534
00:57:02.48 --> 00:57:09.04
who was putting in those where those mosquito nets were made. These were pretty good profits

535
00:57:09.04 --> 00:57:12.88
in mosquito netting in those days. Even if there were no mosquitoes in France. I suppose if the

536
00:57:12.88 --> 00:57:16.16
ward lasted just a little bit longer, the enterprising mosquito netting manufacturers would have

537
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:20.72
sold Uncle Sam a couple of consignments of mosquitoes to plant in France so that more mosquito netting

538
00:57:20.72 --> 00:57:27.04
would be in order. Airplane and air and engine manufacturers felt they too should adjust their

539
00:57:27.04 --> 00:57:32.80
profits out of this ward. Why not? Everybody else is getting theirs. So a billion dollars. Count them

540
00:57:32.80 --> 00:57:36.48
if you live long enough with spend by Uncle Sam and building airplane engines that never left

541
00:57:36.48 --> 00:57:42.000
the ground. Not one plane or motor out of the billion dollars worth ordered ever got in a battle in

542
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.80
France. Just the same the manufacturers made their little profit of 30, 100 or perhaps 300%.

543
00:57:53.04 --> 00:57:57.52
Remember the fraud wasting abuse hotline? Apparently they didn't have that. Like in the military

544
00:57:57.52 --> 00:58:02.32
echo Charles they got to think called the fraud wasting abuse hotline. You call up and say hey

545
00:58:02.32 --> 00:58:07.60
we're buying plane engines. We got them lined up. We're not using them. We're buying mosquito nets.

546
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:13.52
We're not using them. Did anyone actually use that? Or do you know of anyone who I never

547
00:58:13.52 --> 00:58:18.48
used it? Did you ever use it? I never used it but I know the sticker. I know if I would

548
00:58:18.48 --> 00:58:22.40
had to use that. Probably to use it on my task and my platoon for the money we were wasting on

549
00:58:22.40 --> 00:58:31.52
ammunition. Just slaying ammunition. Under shirts four soldiers cost 14 cents to make an

550
00:58:31.52 --> 00:58:34.56
uncle Sam paid 30 to 40 cents each for them a nice little profit for the underserved

551
00:58:34.56 --> 00:58:37.92
manufacturer and the stocking manufacturing and the uniform manufacturers and the cap

552
00:58:37.92 --> 00:58:41.84
manufacturing and the steel helmet manufacturers all got theirs. Why when the war was over

553
00:58:43.04 --> 00:58:46.56
some four million sets of equipment. Nap Saxon and the things that go to fill them

554
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:50.40
crammed warehouses on this side. Now they are being scrapped because the regulations have

555
00:58:50.40 --> 00:58:54.72
changed the contents but the manufacturers collected their wartime profits on them

556
00:58:54.72 --> 00:59:00.000
and they will do it all over again next time. There were lots of brilliant ideas

557
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.32
for making profit during the war. One very versatile Patriot sold uncle Sam 12 does in 48

558
00:59:06.32 --> 00:59:11.20
inchorrentes. Oh they were very nice wrenches. The only trouble was that there was only one nut

559
00:59:11.20 --> 00:59:15.84
ever made that was large enough for these wrenches. That's the one that holds the turbines at

560
00:59:15.84 --> 00:59:21.20
Niagara Falls. Well after uncle Sam had bought them and manufactured and the manufacturer

561
00:59:21.20 --> 00:59:24.88
profited from them the wrenches were put on freight cars and shunted all around the United

562
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.28
States in an effort to find a use for them. When the armistice was signed it was indeed a

563
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:33.84
sad blow to the wrenches manufacturer. He was just about to make some nuts to fit the runches.

564
00:59:34.80 --> 00:59:40.96
Then he planned to sell those to your uncle Sam. Still another brilliant idea that the

565
00:59:40.96 --> 00:59:46.000
Colonel shouldn't ride an automobile. Nor should they even ride on horseback. One has probably

566
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.44
seen a picture of Andy Jackson riding on a buckboard. Well some 6,000 buckboards were sold the

567
00:59:51.44 --> 00:59:58.16
uncle Sam for the use by Colonel's not one of them was used. The buckboard manufacturer got his war

568
00:59:58.16 --> 01:00:05.04
profit. Buckboard is like a wagon. It's like a carriage with leaf springs to be told behind a horse

569
01:00:05.04 --> 01:00:14.08
6,000 of them. The ship builders felt they should come on on some of it too. They built a lot of

570
01:00:14.08 --> 01:00:18.72
ships that they made a lot of profit more than $3 billion worth. Some of the ships were all right.

571
01:00:19.60 --> 01:00:25.12
But 635 million worth of them were made of wood that wouldn't float. The seams opened up and they

572
01:00:25.12 --> 01:00:29.92
sank. We paid for them though and somebody pocketed the profits. It's been estimated by status

573
01:00:29.92 --> 01:00:35.20
titions and economists and researchers that the war cost your uncle Sam 52 billion dollars.

574
01:00:35.76 --> 01:00:42.000
Of this sum 39 billion was expended in the actual war itself. This 6 manager yielded 16

575
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:50.000
billion dollars in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires and millionaires got that way.

576
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.64
This 16 billion dollars in profits is not to be sneezed at it's quite a tidy sum and it went to a very

577
01:00:56.64 --> 01:01:02.56
few. The Senate committee probe of the munitions industry and its wartime profits despite its

578
01:01:02.56 --> 01:01:09.28
sensational closers hardly had scratched the surface. Even so it's had some effect. The state

579
01:01:09.28 --> 01:01:14.24
department had been studying for some time methods of keeping out of war. The war department suddenly

580
01:01:14.24 --> 01:01:18.80
decides it has a wonderful plan to spring. The administration names a committee with the war

581
01:01:18.80 --> 01:01:24.88
navy departments abley represented under the chairmanship of a Wall Street speculator to limit

582
01:01:24.88 --> 01:01:33.52
profits in wartime. To what extent isn't suggested? Hmm. Possibly the profits of 306,600

583
01:01:33.52 --> 01:01:39.36
of those who turned blood into gold in World War in the World War would be limited to some

584
01:01:39.36 --> 01:01:46.32
smaller figure. Apparently however the plan does not call for any limitation of losses. That is the

585
01:01:46.32 --> 01:01:53.04
loss losses of those who fight the war. As far as I have been able to ascertain there is nothing in

586
01:01:53.04 --> 01:01:59.28
this scheme to limit a soldier to the loss of but one eye or one arm or to limit his wounds to one

587
01:01:59.28 --> 01:02:06.40
or two or three or to limit the loss of life. There's nothing in this scheme apparently that says

588
01:02:06.40 --> 01:02:11.92
not more than 12% of a regiment shall be wounded in battle or not more than 7% of a division shall

589
01:02:11.92 --> 01:02:20.40
be killed. Of course the committee cannot be bothered with such trifling matters. So they put together

590
01:02:20.40 --> 01:02:23.92
a committee and say well you know they're making a little too much money. We should put a limit on how

591
01:02:23.92 --> 01:02:38.32
much money they can make. Possibly limit those war profits. Chapter 3, who pays the bills?

592
01:02:38.32 --> 01:02:47.92
Who provides the profits these nice little profits of 20, 100, 3,500, 1,500, 1,800%. We all pay them.

593
01:02:47.92 --> 01:02:54.96
In taxation we paid the bankers their profits when we bought liberty bonds at $100 and sold them

594
01:02:54.96 --> 01:03:03.76
back at 84 or 86 to the bankers. These bankers collected $100 plus it was a simple manipulation.

595
01:03:03.76 --> 01:03:09.60
The bankers control the security marks. It was easy for them to depress the price of these bonds.

596
01:03:09.60 --> 01:03:14.24
Then all of us the people got frightened and sold the bonds at 84 or 86. The bankers bought them.

597
01:03:15.20 --> 01:03:21.92
Then the same bankers stimulated a boom and government bonds went to par and above and then the

598
01:03:21.92 --> 01:03:29.92
bankers collected their profits. But the soldier pays the biggest part of the bill.

599
01:03:29.92 --> 01:03:36.000
If you don't believe this visit the American Cemeteries on the battlefield abroad.

600
01:03:37.52 --> 01:03:40.80
Or visit any of the veterans hospitals in the United States.

601
01:03:42.48 --> 01:03:47.84
On a tour of the country in the midst of which I am I am doing at the time of writing this,

602
01:03:47.84 --> 01:03:50.96
I have visited 18 government hospitals for veterans.

603
01:03:52.88 --> 01:03:56.40
In them are a total of about 50,000 destroyed men.

604
01:03:56.40 --> 01:03:59.84
Men who were the pick of the nation 18 years ago.

605
01:04:01.36 --> 01:04:08.48
The very able chief surgeon at the government hospital at Milwaukee where there are 3,800 of the

606
01:04:08.48 --> 01:04:15.76
living dead told me that mortality among veterans is three times as great as among those who stayed at home.

607
01:04:17.60 --> 01:04:24.80
So this was interesting because we hear a lot about what happens when we come home. We hear about PTSD.

608
01:04:24.80 --> 01:04:31.44
And you see like the images of shell shock in World War II, especially in England and the Brits.

609
01:04:32.24 --> 01:04:34.56
You don't hear a lot about it from World War I.

610
01:04:35.68 --> 01:04:42.16
And this is a weirdly written sentence. I tried to read it in a way that made it made sense.

611
01:04:42.16 --> 01:04:46.32
But it says the very able surgeon, the very able chief surgeon at the government hospital,

612
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:54.32
semi colon at Milwaukee where there are 3,800 of the living dead told me that the mortality among veterans

613
01:04:54.32 --> 01:04:59.84
is three times as great as among those who stayed at home. So what he's saying is people that fought

614
01:04:59.84 --> 01:05:05.84
are three times likely to die. Three times more likely to die than someone that didn't fight.

615
01:05:06.88 --> 01:05:10.24
Doesn't talk about how, but my guess is a lot of those are suicide.

616
01:05:10.24 --> 01:05:18.96
Or just like the crazy violent deaths that military people that have that experience end up having.

617
01:05:22.80 --> 01:05:30.000
And here he goes into it a little bit. In the most simplistic and so obvious way.

618
01:05:31.92 --> 01:05:38.000
Boys with a normal viewpoint were taken out of the fields and offices in factories and classrooms

619
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:46.88
and put into the ranks. They were remolded. They were made over. They were made to about face

620
01:05:48.32 --> 01:05:55.92
to regard murder as the order of the day. They were put shoulder to shoulder and through mass

621
01:05:55.92 --> 01:06:03.84
psychology. They were entirely changed. We used them for a couple of years and trained them to think

622
01:06:03.84 --> 01:06:13.20
nothing at all of killing or of being killed. Then suddenly we discharged them and told them to

623
01:06:13.20 --> 01:06:21.28
make another about face. This time they had to do their own re-adjustment without mass psychology,

624
01:06:21.28 --> 01:06:29.04
without officers aid and advice and without nationwide propaganda. We didn't need them anymore.

625
01:06:29.04 --> 01:06:38.32
So we scattered them about with any three-minute or liberty-loan speeches or without any three-minute

626
01:06:38.32 --> 01:06:45.28
or liberty-loan speeches or parades. Many too many of these fine young boys are eventually

627
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:50.40
destroyed mentally because they could not make that final about face alone.

628
01:06:50.40 --> 01:07:03.60
That's pretty straightforward. And he gives up, example here he says, in the government hospital

629
01:07:03.60 --> 01:07:13.28
in Marion, Indiana, 1,800 of these boys are in pens. 500 of them in a barracks with steel bars

630
01:07:13.28 --> 01:07:19.92
and wires all around the outside of the buildings and on the porches. These already have been

631
01:07:19.92 --> 01:07:25.36
mentally destroyed. These boys don't even look like human beings. Oh, the look on their faces.

632
01:07:26.48 --> 01:07:31.68
Physically they are in good shape. Mentally, they are gone.

633
01:07:34.72 --> 01:07:39.68
There are thousands and thousands of these cases and more and more are coming in all the time.

634
01:07:40.56 --> 01:07:44.72
The tremendous excitement of the war, the sudden cutting off of that excitement,

635
01:07:44.72 --> 01:07:54.72
the young boys couldn't stand it. I'm going to have to dig into that and I have to get some

636
01:07:54.72 --> 01:08:07.84
research going on that because that sounds horrific. 1800, 1800 men boys, he's calling them, but

637
01:08:07.84 --> 01:08:18.24
this is 1935, the war ended in 1918. So these are young men and you just don't hear about this.

638
01:08:21.60 --> 01:08:26.24
Hear about it now. You don't hear about it for World War One.

639
01:08:28.56 --> 01:08:32.88
And in fact World War II, I've talked about well, you know World War II, you got to come

640
01:08:32.88 --> 01:08:37.92
home on a ship with some other guys and you got to decompress for five or six weeks and you

641
01:08:37.92 --> 01:08:41.84
held up as a hero and all this stuff and that's why it was easier to adapt. It's like,

642
01:08:41.84 --> 01:08:48.40
well, what about World War I? And that freaking psychotic war.

643
01:08:51.60 --> 01:08:56.40
Yeah, I mean, everything that's in my mind obviously has to be tempered with the fact that I truly

644
01:08:56.40 --> 01:09:04.96
cannot claim to appreciate the reality that he is describing. He said he's been basically talking

645
01:09:04.96 --> 01:09:08.72
about VA hospitals. He's been 18 different VA hospitals. This is a passion for him. He's going around

646
01:09:08.72 --> 01:09:18.40
seeing what's going on. And at least in this sense of when you think about World War II that there

647
01:09:18.40 --> 01:09:25.44
was this, and I got to assume it was felt at the time, it's very clear sense of good and evil,

648
01:09:25.44 --> 01:09:34.16
right and wrong and the sides that we are on and the justification and the necessity, the global

649
01:09:34.16 --> 01:09:38.80
necessity. And if you think about World War I, at least try to reconcile the loss and what was it

650
01:09:38.80 --> 01:09:44.80
for and what was really at stake and how much blurrier, you don't feel that in World War I and

651
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:49.76
you talk about probably a nation that's just totally ill equipped to have a 25-year-old come

652
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:56.16
back after seeing what they saw without even being able to say, hey, I at least saved the world, you know,

653
01:09:57.68 --> 01:10:03.44
from Holocaust or nuclear war, whatever it could have been at stake by the end of World War II,

654
01:10:04.80 --> 01:10:13.52
and being totally ill equipped to know how to even handle that. At least in modern times,

655
01:10:13.52 --> 01:10:19.04
right, you're at least a little bit desensitized, right? You're seeing horror movies, you're

656
01:10:19.04 --> 01:10:24.72
seeing blood and guts, you're playing first person shooter video games. Like this is, can you imagine

657
01:10:24.72 --> 01:10:31.84
coming from freaking Omaha, Nebraska where you're like going to school? You know, I mean, you're just

658
01:10:31.84 --> 01:10:36.40
a normal kid. That might not even be the best example, because at least in Omaha, Nebraska,

659
01:10:36.40 --> 01:10:42.32
you're your slaughter and pigs, you're shooting guns, but if you're in whatever, if you're from

660
01:10:42.32 --> 01:10:47.68
the city and you're just not around that, you're not seeing it. And then boom, you're thrown

661
01:10:47.68 --> 01:10:54.64
into World War I. And there was another section that he did that that I know about, Smellie Butler.

662
01:10:55.36 --> 01:11:00.64
There was a point, I think it was when he was in China where he, for the first time saw like

663
01:11:00.64 --> 01:11:07.04
mass slaughtered Japanese, and it just one of those points that he had seen some real

664
01:11:07.04 --> 01:11:14.64
violence, and that was before World War I. But yeah, at least nowadays, this might be a bad thing.

665
01:11:14.64 --> 01:11:22.48
Is that people are desensitized somewhat, you know, going, going, whatever, YouTube,

666
01:11:22.88 --> 01:11:26.72
I don't know, does YouTube feel throughout like heinous shootings and stuff like that?

667
01:11:26.72 --> 01:11:31.28
Yeah. So where do you see stuff like that now? Oddly end, I don't know, go to deep into it,

668
01:11:31.28 --> 01:11:35.84
but oddly, they had a few websites out there that you could just go. Yeah. They say click here,

669
01:11:35.84 --> 01:11:39.92
make sure you're 18, whatever. Yeah. And then you can watch what ever sick video you want, but

670
01:11:39.92 --> 01:11:45.84
as I've noticed, not that I frequent these things, but as I've noticed, they've been kind of disappearing.

671
01:11:45.84 --> 01:11:52.88
Yeah, that's interesting. Like I remember there was a video of a Russian soldier

672
01:11:53.60 --> 01:11:59.52
being killed by a by a cheshishan, and it's brutal. They're putting his boot on his head, and they're

673
01:11:59.52 --> 01:12:04.48
just, he's screaming and their cuteness throughout, and he's sort of like slowly, the impact of the

674
01:12:04.48 --> 01:12:09.36
knife blade. Yeah, that's old school. There's way worse stuff. I'm saying that's old school, but I haven't

675
01:12:09.36 --> 01:12:14.72
seen that in a long time. And but I'm sure there's like some websites where you can see all that stuff.

676
01:12:14.72 --> 01:12:21.52
Yeah. And I like I said, I think they're kind of quietly doing away with them.

677
01:12:22.56 --> 01:12:28.48
Maybe because they encourage certain groups to be like, oh, let's see if we can put ours up,

678
01:12:28.48 --> 01:12:33.20
you know, because in that dark area of the internet, it's like the people who are responsible for

679
01:12:33.20 --> 01:12:39.12
making those videos. Sometimes they get into these little competitions to see who can make

680
01:12:39.12 --> 01:12:48.64
the sickest video. Well, and they go hard for sure. Even if you just saw rated our movies,

681
01:12:49.68 --> 01:12:56.64
you would be more accustomed to this kind of scenery. Oh, yeah. And you have like, like, yeah,

682
01:12:56.64 --> 01:13:02.40
the exposure of what war actually is is way more now compared to that time like that. Yeah, if you

683
01:13:02.40 --> 01:13:07.92
watched saving private Ryan, yeah, you're like, okay, man. I mean, this is, oh, yeah, and there's

684
01:13:07.92 --> 01:13:13.28
reports, plenty of reports like World War II veterans that we're at D Day. We're totally, you know,

685
01:13:13.28 --> 01:13:18.48
thought that nailed it and they were very disturbed in watching it. And had to take a break,

686
01:13:18.48 --> 01:13:23.84
had to walk out whatever because it was so realistic. So that's going to condition you. But if you

687
01:13:23.84 --> 01:13:32.24
leave freaking Maryland where you live in a small neighborhood and your dad works at the factory

688
01:13:32.24 --> 01:13:39.12
and next thing, you know, you're in World War I. And then, and then all of a sudden, three weeks

689
01:13:39.12 --> 01:13:43.76
later, you're back back in Maryland. You're in your neighborhood. Yeah, it's going to be a rough one.

690
01:13:43.76 --> 01:13:48.16
That's a good way to put it. Well, I was like, hey, they take you out of your normal world and make

691
01:13:48.16 --> 01:13:53.52
you do it about face with all this essential training and like all this, you know, this influence

692
01:13:53.52 --> 01:13:58.000
and stuff. And then when that's done, just all of a sudden, a do another about face, but hey,

693
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.40
do it on your own kind of a thing. Same thing. That's exactly what happened to you know, that song

694
01:14:02.40 --> 01:14:08.08
by the White Buffaloly played on here. It's called Wish It Was True. Well, when he was on here,

695
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:15.20
he played that song and I actually had like asked him to play that song. Yeah. And, um, but the song,

696
01:14:15.20 --> 01:14:19.76
you know, it's got a line in there that basically says, hey, you're just a number and we used you

697
01:14:19.76 --> 01:14:23.68
in your through and there's a couple of people that you know, left some comments or hit me up like,

698
01:14:23.68 --> 01:14:29.44
this is an anti-war song. What are you talking about? And I was like, hey, bro, this is what happens.

699
01:14:29.44 --> 01:14:33.68
Yeah. It doesn't happen all the time, but this is a, this is a song written from someone's individual

700
01:14:33.68 --> 01:14:38.72
viewpoint of, hey, went to war, whatever war it was, maybe it was World War One World War Two,

701
01:14:38.72 --> 01:14:42.64
World War, uh, Korea Vietnam. There's plenty of people that went to those wars,

702
01:14:43.20 --> 01:14:48.08
came home and this is exactly what happened. That's what that song is about. It's not saying,

703
01:14:48.08 --> 01:14:54.16
oh, you, you just got used by the every single soldiers, not saying that. But there, this happens.

704
01:14:54.16 --> 01:14:59.36
This does happen. And that's why it's such powerful song. This might sound a little bit insensitive,

705
01:14:59.36 --> 01:15:03.68
but you know, you don't, you don't ramble. That's what that story was essentially about.

706
01:15:03.68 --> 01:15:07.60
When you watch First Blood, you know, right? Like, that's essentially what it was about.

707
01:15:07.60 --> 01:15:11.60
And then they, then they, of course, they do them dirty again, send them to jail and then

708
01:15:11.60 --> 01:15:15.52
ramble too. They're like, oh, wait, we need that guy again. You know, let's go get that guy. And then they

709
01:15:15.52 --> 01:15:19.20
do them try to do them dirty again. Same same thing. That is essentially the story. You know,

710
01:15:19.20 --> 01:15:24.16
and it's not, and, and look, there's plenty of people that come home from war and they get,

711
01:15:24.16 --> 01:15:28.56
they're able to deal with it. And they go cool, you know what, I did what I had to do. And now I'm

712
01:15:28.56 --> 01:15:32.32
going back to the work, you know, go back to the factory, I'm going back to the construction site,

713
01:15:32.32 --> 01:15:36.24
going back to the, to the insurance business that I'm running or that I work at. Like,

714
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:40.96
people, people do, and they also saw different things. Or did this person see? They'll do different

715
01:15:40.96 --> 01:15:45.20
things. What did this person do? So we got to take all these things into account. But no,

716
01:15:45.20 --> 01:15:49.04
like you just pointed out, echo, the fact that you're going to take hundreds of thousands of people

717
01:15:50.16 --> 01:15:54.08
in World War I and World War II, you're going to take hundreds of thousands of people

718
01:15:55.04 --> 01:16:00.88
and train them to kill. And then when it's over, you let cool, we're good. I appreciate it, see you later.

719
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:09.68
And I mean, I don't, uh, Eugene Sledge. I mean, he had a really hard time when he came home from war.

720
01:16:10.40 --> 01:16:14.64
A really hard time when he came home from war. And he still carried on with his normal life. I mean,

721
01:16:14.64 --> 01:16:20.72
actually all those guys did, um, all those guys that were over there had a real hard time. But

722
01:16:20.72 --> 01:16:26.96
there's also millions of veterans that came home and like, they carried on with their life.

723
01:16:26.96 --> 01:16:33.76
You know, I mean, um, I mean, if had had him on this podcast, I mean, Charlie Plum, how does he come

724
01:16:33.76 --> 01:16:38.000
home from six years of captivity and just like, okay, well, you know, do you know, we're going to move on?

725
01:16:39.12 --> 01:16:44.16
William Reader. By the way, William Reader 40 years, like stayed in the army for another,

726
01:16:44.16 --> 01:16:49.36
whatever 38 years, huh? Doing his job, getting a fit rep. How do you write a fit rep for

727
01:16:49.36 --> 01:16:53.68
for William Reader? How do you not just say, hey, sir, what look, I'm supposed to be a charge of you.

728
01:16:53.68 --> 01:16:58.80
You just sound like what you want to do because you have done more than for the military than I could

729
01:16:58.80 --> 01:17:04.16
have ever hoped to have done. And I appreciate you sitting here and not like, not like beating me up,

730
01:17:04.16 --> 01:17:09.68
or whatever, not not counseling me on what an idiot I am. So there's plenty of people that

731
01:17:09.68 --> 01:17:14.16
come home and they, they, all right, now I will say this and Charlie Plum pointed this out to me,

732
01:17:15.20 --> 01:17:21.68
they're the amount of like, post-traumatic stress that the guys that were in the Hanoi

733
01:17:21.68 --> 01:17:28.72
Hilton had was less on average than normal, infantrymen. And it's because they had this camaraderie.

734
01:17:29.52 --> 01:17:33.92
At least that's what he said. At least I think I remember what he said. But what they had this camaraderie

735
01:17:33.92 --> 01:17:40.32
said was like, hey, you know, we were all, and they had time to process it and, and then they got this

736
01:17:40.32 --> 01:17:47.04
huge beautiful welcome home. And I mean, when I, it was Jim Serlesley, I think it was Jim Serlesley,

737
01:17:47.04 --> 01:17:53.44
when he, you know, he's lost both legs and his arm and the guys came home from being POWs

738
01:17:53.44 --> 01:18:02.08
with the white, you know, with the big reception. He was like, hey, bro. I understand you guys

739
01:18:02.08 --> 01:18:08.72
were held captive. I'm sorry, you know, I, I got back and just went to a freaking rehab for nine

740
01:18:08.72 --> 01:18:16.48
months and then I'm out here with one arm. So that probably helped the guys that were cap captives

741
01:18:16.48 --> 01:18:22.08
in Vietnam as well as that they got a very warm welcome home. And as we know, a lot of

742
01:18:22.80 --> 01:18:30.08
Vietnam veterans did not get a warm welcome home. And from what it sounds like here, same thing,

743
01:18:30.08 --> 01:18:36.80
World War I, oh, the look on their faces physically, they're in good shape mentally, they are gone.

744
01:18:39.52 --> 01:18:44.96
I wrote that down to that, that the metaphor that he describes about, we take them, we have them

745
01:18:44.96 --> 01:18:49.36
doing about face and then we have them doing another about face and it's they can't do that second one.

746
01:18:49.92 --> 01:18:52.48
We have them do the second one on their own on their own and they can't do it.

747
01:18:52.48 --> 01:19:02.32
It's not unreasonable to think and just I was literally just thinking about what, who are you?

748
01:19:02.32 --> 01:19:11.60
If you're a 21, 22 year old male in 1914, go to World War I, who are you? And it's, it's not

749
01:19:11.60 --> 01:19:18.80
unreasonable to think that they had no idea what war was period, what war was. And if you think about

750
01:19:18.80 --> 01:19:26.40
today like joining the military to your point, at least some exposures, successful anybody,

751
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:31.04
you have some idea what war is. You've seen Pultoon, you've seen Cole Metal jacket, you've seen

752
01:19:31.04 --> 01:19:36.08
Save in Private Ryan, you've seen Apocalypse Now, you've seen all these movies. Yes. And it's in the

753
01:19:36.08 --> 01:19:40.32
National Psychic, you people are talking about it, people have been talking about it, if you were in

754
01:19:40.32 --> 01:19:46.64
World War I and you're 20, I mean the last, there's a story that's probably due to math, but like

755
01:19:46.64 --> 01:19:51.04
this, unless you have some connection to the Civil War which ended 50 years ago and you're

756
01:19:51.04 --> 01:19:58.24
getting stories from your grandpa, you have no idea what war is and then you're going to World War I.

757
01:19:59.12 --> 01:20:08.96
Where the use of human capital, the use of human being was less significant than

758
01:20:08.96 --> 01:20:16.08
than any other piece of material that was out there. And today like I did 23 years in the

759
01:20:16.08 --> 01:20:19.92
Marine Corps, I retired like five years, it's like 30 years coming up on my military experience.

760
01:20:20.96 --> 01:20:27.36
We take excessive, sometimes tactically unsound lengths to preserve American lives.

761
01:20:27.36 --> 01:20:35.12
Now obviously we know that doesn't always work out, but we don't buy design waste lives.

762
01:20:35.12 --> 01:20:39.52
And you can kind of almost count on that like, hey, there, there are no more human waves.

763
01:20:39.52 --> 01:20:43.12
There's no way, hey listen, Jens, have a seat, let's talk about this plan.

764
01:20:43.12 --> 01:20:46.80
We know we're all going to get wiped out, but we have to go do this.

765
01:20:46.80 --> 01:20:52.000
Those conversations aren't really happening. And so you kind of know what you're getting into

766
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
a little bit, at least softens out a little bit, you know what war is, some idea what to

767
01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.56
words going to be like, I can't imagine a bigger contrast at being 19 years old age are going

768
01:21:00.56 --> 01:21:05.60
to Europe and like, hey, where is that? Okay cool, it's here. Hey, what country is that?

769
01:21:06.32 --> 01:21:10.88
That's this country here. Okay, who are we fighting? These people over here, how does this

770
01:21:10.88 --> 01:21:17.84
gonna work? Well, when you get there, we'll show you. Okay cool. And then you see World War

771
01:21:17.84 --> 01:21:24.08
1. Yeah. The second about face to do on your own. Yeah, it's going to be rough. It's not going

772
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:30.72
to work out, right? And he's not touring the country going. Yeah. And yeah, the frustration is,

773
01:21:30.72 --> 01:21:35.04
should we probably take a couple of those dollars? I mean the sarcasm with with just the

774
01:21:35.04 --> 01:21:39.36
sea so should we take a couple of those dollars? It may be help these folks with that about face

775
01:21:39.36 --> 01:21:45.84
these patriots over here making money. Again, and this is just me saying, I can appreciate

776
01:21:45.84 --> 01:21:54.64
this point of view, get where he's coming from. And this is, this is not some coward. This is not

777
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:59.68
some, this is not a dude who's sitting on the sidelines casting judgment. This is a guy who,

778
01:21:59.68 --> 01:22:04.72
who, for whatever got back in the, this is a guy who can speak, you know, of a first person

779
01:22:04.72 --> 01:22:11.12
point of view certainly again. So he gets done talking about that part of the bill and he says,

780
01:22:11.12 --> 01:22:17.84
that's a part of the bill. So much for the dead, they have paid their part of the war profits.

781
01:22:17.84 --> 01:22:23.04
So much for the mentally and physically wounded. They are paying now for their share of the war

782
01:22:23.04 --> 01:22:29.52
profits. But others paid too. They paid with heartbreaks when they tore themselves away from their

783
01:22:29.52 --> 01:22:35.44
fire sides and their families to down the uniform of Uncle Sam on which a profit had been made.

784
01:22:36.24 --> 01:22:41.76
They paid another part in the training camps where they were regimented and drilled while others took

785
01:22:41.76 --> 01:22:46.64
their jobs and their places in their lives and in their communities. They paid for it in the

786
01:22:46.64 --> 01:22:51.76
trenches when they were shot at and they were shot, where they were hungry for days at a time,

787
01:22:51.76 --> 01:22:58.72
where they slept in mud and cold and rain with the moans and shrieks of the dying for a horrible

788
01:22:58.72 --> 01:23:06.16
lullaby. But don't forget the soldier paid part of the dollars and cents bill too.

789
01:23:07.36 --> 01:23:12.32
Up to an including the Spanish-American War, we had a prize system and soldiers and sailors fought

790
01:23:12.32 --> 01:23:17.60
for money during the Civil War they were paid bonuses and many instances before they went into

791
01:23:17.60 --> 01:23:22.64
service. The government or the states paid as high as $1,200 for an enlistment.

792
01:23:22.64 --> 01:23:29.12
In the Spanish-American War they gave prize money when we captured any vessel vessels,

793
01:23:29.12 --> 01:23:32.56
the soldiers all got their share. At least they were supposed to.

794
01:23:33.92 --> 01:23:39.12
Then it was found we could reduce the cost of wars by taking all the prize money and keeping it.

795
01:23:39.92 --> 01:23:45.76
But constricted, conscripting, the soldiers anyway. So it's going to the draft. Then soldiers

796
01:23:45.76 --> 01:23:52.88
couldn't bargain for their labor and either. Everyone else could bargain. But the soldier couldn't.

797
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:58.72
Napoleon once said, all men are enamored of decorations. They positively hunger for them.

798
01:23:58.72 --> 01:24:03.20
So by developing an Napoleonic system, the metal business, the government learned to

799
01:24:03.20 --> 01:24:08.24
get soldiers for less money because the boys like to be decorated. Until the Civil War there

800
01:24:08.24 --> 01:24:14.32
were no metals. Then the congressional metal of honor was handed out. It made enlistments easier.

801
01:24:14.32 --> 01:24:19.76
After the Civil War no new metals were issued until the Spanish-American War. In the World War

802
01:24:19.76 --> 01:24:26.24
we used propaganda to make the boys accept conscription. They were made to feel ashamed if they

803
01:24:26.24 --> 01:24:32.08
didn't join the army. So vicious was this war propaganda that even God was brought into it.

804
01:24:32.48 --> 01:24:38.48
With a few exceptions our clergymen joined then in the clamor to kill, kill, kill, to kill the

805
01:24:38.48 --> 01:24:45.52
Germans. God is on our side. It is his will that the German should be killed. And in Germany the

806
01:24:45.52 --> 01:24:52.08
good pastors called upon the Germans to kill the Allies to please the same God. That was part of

807
01:24:52.08 --> 01:24:59.12
the general propaganda built up to make people war, conscious and murder, conscious.

808
01:25:02.24 --> 01:25:06.72
Beautiful ideals were painted for our boys who were sent out to die. This was the war to end

809
01:25:06.72 --> 01:25:12.88
all wars. This was the war to make the world safe for democracy. No one mentioned to them as they

810
01:25:12.88 --> 01:25:17.84
marched away that they're going and dying would mean huge war profits. No one told these

811
01:25:17.84 --> 01:25:22.08
American soldiers that they might be shot down by bullets made by their own brothers here.

812
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:26.88
No one told them that the ships on which they were going to cross might be torpedoed by submarines

813
01:25:26.88 --> 01:25:32.56
built with United States patents. They were just told it was going to be a glorious adventure.

814
01:25:32.56 --> 01:25:40.48
Thus having stuffed patriotism down their throats it was decided to make them help pay for the

815
01:25:40.48 --> 01:25:46.72
war too. So we gave them a large salary of $30 a month. All they had to do for this magnificent

816
01:25:46.72 --> 01:25:52.48
sum was to leave their dear ones behind, give up their jobs, lion swampy trenches, eat canned

817
01:25:52.48 --> 01:25:58.40
willy when they could get it and kill and kill and kill and be killed. But wait, half that wage

818
01:25:58.40 --> 01:26:03.20
just a little more than a riveter and a shipyard or a laborer in a munitions factory safe at home

819
01:26:03.20 --> 01:26:07.92
made in a day. Half that wage was promptly taken from him to support his dependence so that he would

820
01:26:07.92 --> 01:26:13.84
not become a charge upon his community. Then we made him pay what amount to to accident insurance,

821
01:26:13.84 --> 01:26:18.96
something the employer pays for in an enlightened state. And that cost him about $6 a month.

822
01:26:19.68 --> 01:26:25.52
Yet less than $9 a month left. Then the most crowning influence of all he was virtually

823
01:26:25.52 --> 01:26:31.60
blackjacked into paying for his own ammunition clothing and food by being made to buy Liberty

824
01:26:31.60 --> 01:26:40.000
bonds. Most soldiers got no money at all on paydays. We made them buy back, we made them buy Liberty

825
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.72
bonds for $100 and then we bought them back when they came back from the war and couldn't find

826
01:26:44.72 --> 01:26:52.32
work at $84 and $86 and the soldiers brought a bought about $2 billion worth of these bonds.

827
01:26:52.32 --> 01:26:58.80
Yes, the soldier pays the greater part of the bill. His family pays to

828
01:26:58.80 --> 01:27:03.84
they pay it in the same heartbreak that he does as he suffers day suffer. At nights as he lay in

829
01:27:03.84 --> 01:27:08.24
the trenches and watch Shrapnel burst about him, they lay home in their beds and tossly

830
01:27:08.24 --> 01:27:12.88
plously. His father, his mother, his wife, his sisters, his brothers, his sons and his daughters.

831
01:27:14.96 --> 01:27:20.24
When he returned home minus an eye or minus a leg or with his mind broken, they suffered too.

832
01:27:20.24 --> 01:27:28.32
As much and sometimes even more than he, yes, and they too contributed their dollars to the

833
01:27:28.32 --> 01:27:32.88
profits of the munition makers and bankers and shipbuilders and the manufacturers and the

834
01:27:32.88 --> 01:27:37.60
speculators made, they too bought Liberty bonds and contributed to the profit of the bankers

835
01:27:37.60 --> 01:27:42.88
after the armistice in the hoax post-pocus of manipulated Liberty bond prices.

836
01:27:42.88 --> 01:27:50.40
And even now the families of the wounded men and of the mentally broken and those who

837
01:27:50.40 --> 01:27:54.72
were never able to readjust themselves are still suffering and pain.

838
01:27:54.72 --> 01:28:08.56
Fact check. I'm going to go ahead and say truth.

839
01:28:10.32 --> 01:28:11.04
So it's going on.

840
01:28:21.20 --> 01:28:21.84
Chapter 4.

841
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:25.04
How to smash this racket?

842
01:28:26.64 --> 01:28:30.48
Well, it's a racket all right. A few profit and the many pay.

843
01:28:31.20 --> 01:28:36.40
But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by a disarmament conference. You can't eliminate it

844
01:28:36.40 --> 01:28:42.000
by peace, parlaise, Geneva, well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions.

845
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.24
It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.

846
01:28:46.24 --> 01:28:53.76
The only way to smash this racket is to conscript capital and industry and labor before nations

847
01:28:53.76 --> 01:28:58.64
manhood can be conscripted. And there's this interesting thing I got to point out when he talks

848
01:28:58.64 --> 01:29:03.84
about capital, industry and labor. He's talking about those groups of people.

849
01:29:03.84 --> 01:29:08.24
And I'm not going to check. It would be saying like the capitalists and the industrialists

850
01:29:08.24 --> 01:29:14.08
and the labor force. You could say that but that's what he, there's the words he uses

851
01:29:14.08 --> 01:29:16.08
this capital industry, talking about those people.

852
01:29:17.44 --> 01:29:21.36
One month before the government can constripped the young man of the nation,

853
01:29:21.36 --> 01:29:27.12
it must constripped capital and industry and labor. Let the officers and the directors and the

854
01:29:27.12 --> 01:29:32.48
high-powered executives of our armament factories and munition makers and our shipbuilders and

855
01:29:32.48 --> 01:29:36.56
airplane builders and the manufacturers of all other things that provide profit and wartime

856
01:29:36.56 --> 01:29:41.28
as well as the bankers and the speculators be conscripted to get $30 a month the same

857
01:29:41.28 --> 01:29:47.36
wage is the lads and the trenches get. But the workers and these plants get the same wages.

858
01:29:47.36 --> 01:29:51.68
All the workers, all presidents, all executives, all directors, all managers, all bankers,

859
01:29:51.68 --> 01:29:56.56
yes and all generals and admirals and officers and all politicians and all government officer

860
01:29:56.56 --> 01:30:01.52
office holders, everyone in the nation can be restricted to a total monthly income not to be

861
01:30:01.52 --> 01:30:04.80
not to exceed that paid to the soldier in the trenches.

862
01:30:06.64 --> 01:30:11.04
Let all these kings and tycoons and masters of business and all those workers

863
01:30:11.04 --> 01:30:17.28
in industry and all our senators and governors and majors pay half of their monthly $30 wage

864
01:30:17.28 --> 01:30:22.000
to their families and pay war risk insurance and by liberty bonds. Why shouldn't they?

865
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:28.48
They aren't running the risk of being killed or having their bodies mangled or their minds shattered.

866
01:30:28.88 --> 01:30:32.72
They aren't sleeping in muddy trenches. They aren't hungry. The soldiers are.

867
01:30:34.72 --> 01:30:39.68
Give capital and industry and labor 30 days to think it over and you will find by that time

868
01:30:39.68 --> 01:30:43.12
there will be no war that will smash the racket that and nothing else.

869
01:30:45.68 --> 01:30:49.92
Maybe I'm a little too optimistic. Capital still has some say so capital won't

870
01:30:49.92 --> 01:30:53.76
permit the taking of profit out of war until the people those who do the suffering and still

871
01:30:53.76 --> 01:30:59.04
pay the price make up their minds that those they elect to office shall do their bidding

872
01:30:59.04 --> 01:31:00.88
and not that of the profit yours.

873
01:31:00.88 --> 01:31:15.44
You know so here you get to like a kind of an argument that's hyperbole right?

874
01:31:15.44 --> 01:31:19.12
Hey what you need to do is first just if you're going to go and you don't know what to

875
01:31:19.12 --> 01:31:24.80
argue with it because it makes sense but it's just a unrealistic thing to think about.

876
01:31:24.80 --> 01:31:31.68
Unfortunately, guys we all get the idea. You want to go you want to go to war?

877
01:31:31.68 --> 01:31:34.96
Cool and he's the interesting he's not going to talk about them going to war. He's just talking

878
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:40.32
about you just get the pay and he's only talking about for 30 days. He's only talking about for 30

879
01:31:40.32 --> 01:31:47.28
days. 30 days you know you're the CEO of a defense company for 30 days you're going to get this pay.

880
01:31:48.64 --> 01:31:52.08
I actually don't think that's enough right now and they get to have to be all a lot more.

881
01:31:52.08 --> 01:32:01.20
You always hear that and actually when you when you read about the Vietnam War,

882
01:32:01.20 --> 01:32:07.20
one of the things that really started to turn the tide of the American public against the Vietnam

883
01:32:07.20 --> 01:32:17.68
War was the draft because all of a sudden it wasn't just the freaking poor redneck from West

884
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:22.88
Virginia or the inner city black kid from Harlem that was getting shipped off the war.

885
01:32:22.88 --> 01:32:30.80
All of a sudden it was like oh you're from wherever and your dad is a lawyer. Your dad is a judge.

886
01:32:30.80 --> 01:32:36.40
Your dad is a business owner and you got a bunch of money and guess what? Yeah, load up,

887
01:32:37.28 --> 01:32:44.24
load up on the bus because it's time to go get some and that's as that expanded and normal

888
01:32:44.24 --> 01:32:51.60
richer people started going to war. It was like rich kids the rich parents started sending their

889
01:32:51.60 --> 01:32:54.96
kids off to war. That's a problem and that's one of the things that started to push the

890
01:32:55.76 --> 01:33:03.60
the resistance against the Vietnam War because when it was just hey we're sending a bunch of

891
01:33:03.60 --> 01:33:08.64
damn poor people. Hey cool whatever that's not my kid my kid's not my kid's going to freaking

892
01:33:08.64 --> 01:33:14.80
a college next year. He's not going to boot camp. He's not going to nom. So I don't care. Yeah,

893
01:33:14.80 --> 01:33:19.20
it seems like a great idea. Let's stop calming us over there until little Johnny gets freaking

894
01:33:19.20 --> 01:33:24.72
called up and then they're like oh maybe not. So I would say from that perspective that's

895
01:33:25.60 --> 01:33:31.20
that's a good assessment realistic assessment that if you start saying oh yeah you want to

896
01:33:31.20 --> 01:33:40.32
say you want to send America to war cool your kid goes people start changing their freaking minds real quick.

897
01:33:39.36 --> 01:33:48.80
Factually. He doesn't stop there he's got another step another step which is funny because he

898
01:33:48.80 --> 01:33:52.08
he starts off by saying this the only thing you need to do but he does have another step.

899
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:56.40
Another step necessary in this fight to smash the war racket is limited a limited

900
01:33:56.40 --> 01:34:05.92
plebiscite sorry plebiscite which is a plebiscite is a direct vote like I just a vote plebiscite.

901
01:34:06.88 --> 01:34:12.64
Another step necessary in this war in this fight to smash the war racket is the limited plebiscite

902
01:34:12.64 --> 01:34:19.60
to determine whether a war should be declared a plebiscite not of all the voters but merely of

903
01:34:19.60 --> 01:34:24.96
those who would be called upon to do the fighting and dying. There wouldn't be very much sense

904
01:34:24.96 --> 01:34:30.56
in having a 76 year old president of a munitions factory or the flat-footed head of an international

905
01:34:30.56 --> 01:34:37.04
baking firm or the cross-eyed manager of a uniform man your manufacturing plant all of whom

906
01:34:37.04 --> 01:34:42.96
see see visions of tremendous profits in the event of war voting on whether the nation could

907
01:34:42.96 --> 01:34:48.88
should go to war not. They never would be called upon to shoulder arms to sleep in the trench

908
01:34:48.88 --> 01:34:54.56
and to be shot. Only those who would be called upon to risk their lives for country should have

909
01:34:54.56 --> 01:34:58.24
the privilege of voting to determine whether the nation should go to war.

910
01:35:01.28 --> 01:35:05.60
There is ample precedent for restricting the voting to those affected many of our states have

911
01:35:05.60 --> 01:35:10.32
restrictions on those permitted to vote in most it is necessary to be able to read and write before you

912
01:35:10.32 --> 01:35:15.60
may vote in some you must own property it would be a simple matter each year for the men coming

913
01:35:15.60 --> 01:35:21.20
of military age to register in their communities as they did in the draft during the World War

914
01:35:21.20 --> 01:35:26.24
and be physically examined those who could pass and who were therefore to be who were therefore

915
01:35:26.24 --> 01:35:31.76
be called upon to bear arms in the event of a war would be eligible to vote in a limited

916
01:35:31.76 --> 01:35:37.20
plebiscite. They should be the ones to have the power to decide and not a Congress.

917
01:35:38.56 --> 01:35:44.000
Few of those few of whose members are within the age limit and fewer still of whom are in the

918
01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:53.44
physical condition to bear arms only those who must suffer should have the right to vote.

919
01:35:53.44 --> 01:36:04.16
As I said in a non that kind of work people said not Johnny. He said there was one step

920
01:36:04.16 --> 01:36:09.36
and he introduced to here's the third one. A third step in this business of smashing war

921
01:36:09.36 --> 01:36:14.88
rackets to make certain that our military forces are truly forces for defense only at each

922
01:36:14.88 --> 01:36:20.000
session of Congress the question whether a further naval appropriations comes up.

923
01:36:21.12 --> 01:36:25.20
The swivel chair addables of Washington and there are always a lot of them are very

924
01:36:25.20 --> 01:36:30.56
a droid lobbyist and they are smart. They don't shout that we need a lot of battleships

925
01:36:31.36 --> 01:36:36.24
we need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation. Oh no first of all they let

926
01:36:36.24 --> 01:36:40.88
it be known that America is metast by a great naval power. Almost any day these admirals will tell

927
01:36:40.88 --> 01:36:45.84
you the great fleet of this supposed enemy will strike suddenly in an eyelet 125 million people

928
01:36:45.84 --> 01:36:50.000
just like that. Then they begin to cry for a larger navy for what to fight the enemy.

929
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.68
Oh my no oh no for defense purposes only. Then incidentally they announce maneuvers in the

930
01:36:55.68 --> 01:37:01.28
Pacific for defense. Uh-huh the Pacific is a great big ocean. We have tremendous coastline on a

931
01:37:01.28 --> 01:37:06.80
Pacific. Will the maneuvers be off the coast two or 300 miles? Oh no the maneuvers will be 2000. Yes

932
01:37:06.80 --> 01:37:12.32
perhaps even 3500 miles off the coast. The Japanese are proud people. Of course we'll be pleased

933
01:37:12.32 --> 01:37:17.68
beyond expression to see the United States fleet so close to nippons shores. Even as pleased as

934
01:37:17.68 --> 01:37:22.32
would be the residents of California where they did dimly discern through the morning mist

935
01:37:22.32 --> 01:37:29.12
the Japanese fleet playing at war games off Los Angeles. The ships of our navy it can be seen

936
01:37:29.12 --> 01:37:34.16
should specifically limited by law should be specifically limited by law to within 200 miles of

937
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:39.28
our coastline. Had that been the law of 1898 the main never would have gone to Havana Harbor.

938
01:37:39.28 --> 01:37:43.44
She never would have been blown up. There never would have been no war with Spain with the

939
01:37:43.44 --> 01:37:48.08
attendant loss of life 200 miles is ample in the opinion of experts for defense purposes.

940
01:37:48.64 --> 01:37:52.88
Our nation cannot start off an offensive war if it is ships can't go further than 200 miles off the

941
01:37:52.88 --> 01:37:58.64
coastline. Plans might be ready to go 500 miles from the coast for the purpose of reconnaissance

942
01:37:58.64 --> 01:38:01.44
and the army should never leave the territorial limits of our nation.

943
01:38:02.48 --> 01:38:08.000
Summarize three steps must be taken to smash the war racket. One we must take the profit out of war.

944
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.36
Two we must permit the youth of the land who would bear arms to decide whether or not there should be war

945
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:18.56
and three we must limit our military forces to home defense purposes.

946
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:25.60
Again not great strategic plan does sit back and like to stay in your own

947
01:38:25.60 --> 01:38:31.84
AO you want to project power a little bit you have to piss people off but you definitely want to

948
01:38:31.84 --> 01:38:37.44
project some power out there. Where are you right now Dave? I'm just summarizing what he said.

949
01:38:37.44 --> 01:38:44.32
I'm just trying to I'm spending this all this time just trying to appreciate what he's saying.

950
01:38:44.32 --> 01:38:47.92
Because obviously and I'm going to wait you know I know there's a couple more things to read here.

951
01:38:47.92 --> 01:38:53.44
I'm going to I'm going to wait to the conclusion but I spent a lot of time in my own

952
01:38:53.44 --> 01:38:59.12
brand saying I hear what you're saying. I hear what you're saying. Well this is a but there's a yeah

953
01:38:59.12 --> 01:39:03.44
well this is the thing that we have to do and that's like what the whole start of this thing.

954
01:39:03.44 --> 01:39:08.64
Hey listen man we just spent a trillion dollars totally now in a 20 year war

955
01:39:09.84 --> 01:39:15.04
and when we got there the Taliban was in control of whatever percentage of the of the country

956
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.48
and now we left and they're now going to control 100% is the of the country told we spent a trillion

957
01:39:20.48 --> 01:39:28.32
dollars we have thousands of lost lives we have thousands more wounded named for life.

958
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:37.04
Yeah and and and you have to at least open your mind and say okay what was this guy talking about?

959
01:39:37.04 --> 01:39:40.72
Yeah well was he talking about because like you said this isn't some on chair quarterback

960
01:39:41.92 --> 01:39:42.88
this is a guy that fought.

961
01:39:42.88 --> 01:39:55.84
What chapter five to hell with war? I am not as fool to believe that war is a thing of the

962
01:39:55.84 --> 01:40:00.88
past. I know the people do not want war but there is no use in saying we cannot be pushed into another

963
01:40:00.88 --> 01:40:08.88
war. Looking back Woodrow Wilson was real is reelected president in 1916 on a platform that he

964
01:40:08.88 --> 01:40:15.84
had quote kept us out of war and quote and on the implied promise that he would quote keep us out of war.

965
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:21.68
Yeah five months later he asked Congress to declare war in Germany and that five month interval

966
01:40:21.68 --> 01:40:25.76
that people had not been asked whether they had changed their minds. The four million young men who

967
01:40:25.76 --> 01:40:30.000
put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked whether they wanted to go for

968
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.16
if it's to suffer and die. Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly?

969
01:40:36.16 --> 01:40:45.04
Money. Money. An Allied commission it may be recalled came over shortly before the war declaration

970
01:40:45.04 --> 01:40:49.52
and called on the president. The president summoned a group of advisors. The head of the commission

971
01:40:49.52 --> 01:40:54.40
spoke stripped of its bipelomatic language. This is what he told the president and his group.

972
01:40:56.88 --> 01:41:02.72
There's no use in kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the Allies has lost. We now owe you

973
01:41:02.72 --> 01:41:07.60
American bankers, American, American, American makers, American manufacturers, American speculators,

974
01:41:07.60 --> 01:41:14.64
American exporters, five or six billion dollars. If we lose and without the help of the United

975
01:41:14.64 --> 01:41:22.24
States we will use we England, France, Italy cannot pay back this money and Germany won't. So

976
01:41:24.40 --> 01:41:32.08
end quote had secrecy been outlawed as far as war negotiations were concerned and had the press

977
01:41:32.08 --> 01:41:36.40
been invited to be present at that conference or had the radio been available to broadcast the

978
01:41:36.40 --> 01:41:42.96
pre-seedings. America never would have entered the world of war. But this conference like all

979
01:41:42.96 --> 01:41:49.36
war discussions were shrouded in not most secrecy. When our boys were sent off to war they were told

980
01:41:49.36 --> 01:41:54.48
it was a quote war to make the world safe for democracy and a quote war to end all wars.

981
01:41:54.48 --> 01:42:03.84
Well 18 years after the world has less of the democracy than it had. Besides what business

982
01:42:03.84 --> 01:42:09.52
is it of ours whether Russia or Germany or England or France or Italy or Austria live under

983
01:42:09.52 --> 01:42:16.08
democracies or monarchies whether they are fascist or communist are promised to preserve our own

984
01:42:16.08 --> 01:42:23.20
democracy and very little if anything has been accomplished to assure us that the world war was

985
01:42:23.20 --> 01:42:30.48
really the war to end all wars. Yes we have disarmament conferences and limitations of

986
01:42:30.48 --> 01:42:37.60
arms conferences they don't mean a thing. One has just failed the results of another had been

987
01:42:37.60 --> 01:42:43.52
nullified. We send our professional soldiers and sailors and our politicians and our diplomats

988
01:42:43.52 --> 01:42:49.44
to these conferences and what happens? The professional soldiers and sailors don't want to disarm

989
01:42:49.44 --> 01:42:58.16
no admiral wants to be without a ship no general wants to be without a command. Both mean men

990
01:42:58.72 --> 01:43:05.28
both mean men without jobs they are not for disarmament. They cannot be for limitations of arms

991
01:43:06.32 --> 01:43:10.88
and in all these conferences lurking in the background but all powerful just the same are the

992
01:43:10.88 --> 01:43:18.56
sinister agents who profit by war. They see two at that these conferences do not disarm or

993
01:43:18.56 --> 01:43:26.96
seriously limit armaments. The chief aim of any power and any of these conferences has not been

994
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:33.04
to achieve disarmament to prevent war but rather to get more armament for itself

995
01:43:35.04 --> 01:43:44.48
and less for any potential flow. I remember having this thought when Ewen I were in the

996
01:43:44.48 --> 01:43:55.36
Battle of Romani and that thought was how freaking awesome the US military was and how much

997
01:43:55.36 --> 01:44:02.08
of that awesomeness relied on these individual human beings that were making things happen.

998
01:44:03.04 --> 01:44:09.60
Because when you look at the operations that were taking place when you look at the effort that was

999
01:44:09.60 --> 01:44:18.80
put forth it was literally platoon commanders company commanders battalion commanders brigade commander

1000
01:44:18.80 --> 01:44:27.36
that was that was through force of will making things happen. Making things happen you could if if

1001
01:44:27.36 --> 01:44:32.64
if the brigade commander didn't really care and just wanted to kind of do a deployment getting

1002
01:44:32.64 --> 01:44:39.84
under his belt and just like yep I did my deployment. If he didn't care if you didn't want to do good

1003
01:44:40.88 --> 01:44:44.72
we wouldn't have done anything. Yeah right. Oh the battalion commander that's going to push into

1004
01:44:44.72 --> 01:44:49.68
an area of operations that hasn't been pushed into there is individual effort.

1005
01:44:52.48 --> 01:44:59.36
And here's what scary is looking the battle of Romani we were trying to we're trying to

1006
01:44:59.36 --> 01:45:06.72
stabilize and secure the city of Romani. If there is no goal like that, a clearly defined goal

1007
01:45:06.72 --> 01:45:12.16
and you have people that are trying to do make their best individual effort to make their mark

1008
01:45:12.16 --> 01:45:19.36
to leave their mark to do something to get a good fit rep. What are you going to do? You're going to say

1009
01:45:19.36 --> 01:45:23.52
why I'm going to do this we're going to do that we're going to expand we're going to grow more I need

1010
01:45:23.52 --> 01:45:33.36
more people. This idea that there's no real competing, competing asset or competing

1011
01:45:33.36 --> 01:45:38.000
competing perspective of someone that's saying hey wait a second what are you actually doing

1012
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.88
over there? I mean if let's say you and you are in the Marine Corps and you are supposed to train

1013
01:45:44.88 --> 01:45:54.32
Iraqi soldiers and I do turn over with you and you say hey Jaka we train 100 Iraqi soldiers and

1014
01:45:54.32 --> 01:45:58.96
I go that's great how many Iraqi soldiers do you think I'm going to train? How many think?

1015
01:46:00.16 --> 01:46:04.80
At least the 101 at least the 101. Yeah I'm going to do more than you totally.

1016
01:46:05.76 --> 01:46:09.60
I'm going to do more new I remember this is back in the day I remember going out on a

1017
01:46:09.60 --> 01:46:19.44
workups with the with the fleet and you could see I did a workup with the fleet that was I

1018
01:46:19.44 --> 01:46:26.32
wasn't I wasn't embarked but we did some work with Marines then my next deployment I did

1019
01:46:26.32 --> 01:46:29.92
a full workup with the Marines then the next one I did another full workup with the Marines so I

1020
01:46:29.92 --> 01:46:36.08
did basically saw three workups in a row with the Marines and each one of them was a little bit more

1021
01:46:36.08 --> 01:46:41.92
each workup was a little bit more sure to hey oh yeah you guys did you guys did four amphibious

1022
01:46:41.92 --> 01:46:46.08
landings I'm gonna do five we did five oh what about the next one the next I do in six

1023
01:46:47.28 --> 01:46:53.28
this is real yeah I had similar experience and even in training you know classic

1024
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:56.88
question was the the outgoing squadron versus the incoming squadron how many pounds of

1025
01:46:56.88 --> 01:47:01.28
orders did you drop you know 74,000 cool hey right on the board we're dropping 75 okay

1026
01:47:01.28 --> 01:47:11.44
and that's why I said 101 yeah yeah yeah whatever that is yeah 100% 100% so when you get so

1027
01:47:11.44 --> 01:47:15.60
that that just reminds me what we're talking about here which is no admiral goes you know what I

1028
01:47:15.60 --> 01:47:21.28
think we need less ships the amount of admels that say that is zero the amount of generals that say

1029
01:47:21.28 --> 01:47:26.64
I need less divisions I need less brigades I need less battalion the number of generals that say

1030
01:47:26.64 --> 01:47:33.36
that is zero or you know sure are there some I'm sure there are but the vast majority and those

1031
01:47:33.36 --> 01:47:38.32
those few that say well I think we need less ships he's not gonna he's definitely not getting promoted

1032
01:47:38.32 --> 01:47:42.16
I'm gonna see you know yeah you definitely not gonna be to see you know hey I'm the guy that

1033
01:47:42.16 --> 01:47:47.28
downsize the Navy promote me it's not happening right it's not happening hey I got us less brigades

1034
01:47:47.28 --> 01:47:53.68
less combat brigades good job yeah let's promote you no one says that so you have this self-fulfilling

1035
01:47:53.68 --> 01:47:58.72
prophecy and the self-licking ice cream cone which is a term I understand what it means but I'm not exactly

1036
01:47:58.72 --> 01:48:04.96
sure you know where it came for right but that's what you have right is we want to have more and

1037
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:10.16
that's exactly what he's talking about here there was no one there was very few people

1038
01:48:10.96 --> 01:48:16.72
that would come back and say hey yeah the Iraqi soldiers we had to do it in a body we had to say

1039
01:48:16.72 --> 01:48:22.80
these guys are not ready yet because it was it was so obvious what would happen if we just sent

1040
01:48:22.80 --> 01:48:27.12
them out on their own and they tried I mean remember they turned over like some of the checkpoints

1041
01:48:27.12 --> 01:48:33.76
like two nine or five and they turned it over and and two days later the insurgents hit it and

1042
01:48:33.76 --> 01:48:39.84
overrun it yeah ECP three down there by on the bridge same thing turned it over to the Iraqi

1043
01:48:39.84 --> 01:48:44.88
is hey these guys are ready you know it's like actually know they weren't ready and they got annihilated

1044
01:48:45.76 --> 01:48:51.20
so there wasn't really the the opportunity for us to be like well yeah the Iraqi troops that we

1045
01:48:51.20 --> 01:48:56.08
are trained are now 100% what they call it what they call it they're ready for unilateral operations

1046
01:48:56.08 --> 01:49:00.72
right I didn't send up a message and yep our Iraqis that we've been training for six months

1047
01:49:00.72 --> 01:49:04.40
are now ready for unilateral operations even though that was what everybody wanted us to say but

1048
01:49:04.40 --> 01:49:09.28
we couldn't say it there because you would find out on their first operation that there is no possible

1049
01:49:09.28 --> 01:49:14.32
way they were ready but if we would have been a more permissive environment the pressure to say

1050
01:49:14.88 --> 01:49:18.72
yeah hey they can connect unilateral in the unilateral operations the pressure would have been so

1051
01:49:18.72 --> 01:49:24.32
great because otherwise me like hey jacco the last the last task in a commander that was out here has

1052
01:49:24.32 --> 01:49:30.40
you know he trained up four platoon special mission unit elements that are now that were now

1053
01:49:30.40 --> 01:49:35.36
ready to perform unilateral operations what did you do I'd be like well actually I don't think

1054
01:49:35.36 --> 01:49:41.44
those four are even capable and we should downgrade them what's wrong with you jacco the last task

1055
01:49:41.44 --> 01:49:45.92
in a commander was able to is why couldn't you do that so you we could have felt that pressure

1056
01:49:45.92 --> 01:49:50.48
and a lot of times people break to that pressure I mean obviously I think that happened a lot

1057
01:49:50.48 --> 01:49:56.08
in Afghanistan yeah we trained these guys for six months and who says yeah we trained somebody for

1058
01:49:56.08 --> 01:50:02.000
six months they're not capable we trained them for a year they're not capable it's difficult it's a

1059
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:10.24
difficult thing to do it's also difficult to assess so I think you get this that's what he's talking

1060
01:50:10.24 --> 01:50:15.92
about here there's no no animal wants to be without a ship no general wants to be a lot of command so what

1061
01:50:15.92 --> 01:50:23.92
do they do they want more there's only one way back to the book there's only one way to disarm

1062
01:50:23.92 --> 01:50:30.88
any semblance of practicality that is for all nations to get together and scrap every ship every

1063
01:50:30.88 --> 01:50:36.72
gun every rifle every tank every warplane even this if it were possible would not be enough the

1064
01:50:36.72 --> 01:50:41.52
next war according to experts will not be fought with battleships not by artillery not with rifles and

1065
01:50:41.52 --> 01:50:48.16
not with machine guns but it will be fought with deadly chemicals and gases secretly each nation

1066
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:56.16
is studying and perfecting newer and ghastly remains of annihilating its foes wholesale yes ships

1067
01:50:56.16 --> 01:51:00.64
will continue to be built for the ship builders must make their profits and guns will still be

1068
01:51:00.64 --> 01:51:06.64
manufactured manufactured and powder and rifles will be made for the munitions makers must

1069
01:51:06.64 --> 01:51:14.72
make their huge profits and the soldiers of course must wear uniforms for the manufacturer must make

1070
01:51:14.72 --> 01:51:20.80
their war profits too but victory or defeat will be determined by the skill and ingenuity of our

1071
01:51:20.80 --> 01:51:28.96
scientists if we put them to work making poison gas and more and more finished mechanical and

1072
01:51:28.96 --> 01:51:34.24
explosive instruments of destruction they will have no time for the constructive job of building

1073
01:51:34.24 --> 01:51:42.16
greater prosperity for all peoples by putting them to this useful job we can all make more money

1074
01:51:42.16 --> 01:51:51.44
out of peace then we can out of war even the munitions bakers so I say to hell with war

1075
01:51:51.44 --> 01:52:04.08
and that's the end of it again you know he's in the end you know kind of got the fantasy

1076
01:52:04.08 --> 01:52:10.80
got the fantasy argument of hey can't we just have people working on good the have the

1077
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:15.52
scientists working on good stuff instead of evil stuff and like yeah cool like so it's such an

1078
01:52:15.52 --> 01:52:23.44
extreme argument that people go oh he's he's crazy right and let's throw this whole book out but

1079
01:52:24.72 --> 01:52:29.52
if we're to actually listen to what he's saying and maybe put some of it in the crazy pot

1080
01:52:30.72 --> 01:52:36.40
and put some out in the just factual pot and then some of it is debatable like okay what does that

1081
01:52:36.40 --> 01:52:41.76
actually mean how does that apply today I think it's I think it's very important for us to do that

1082
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:50.80
I was recently on Russell Brands podcast and the thing is it's behind a paywall is that right

1083
01:52:50.80 --> 01:52:58.40
yes pay a firewall paywall it's behind a paywall and so Russell Brand if you don't know who he is he's a guy

1084
01:52:58.40 --> 01:53:04.88
from England super nice guy very funny guy he's he's originally a comedian kind of a movie comedian

1085
01:53:04.88 --> 01:53:13.12
yeah kind of and a performer as well so yes aka all this snow what's his now all this snow that's his

1086
01:53:13.84 --> 01:53:19.04
other alias oh really yeah that's like his character you know and what's that guys supposed to be like

1087
01:53:19.04 --> 01:53:28.64
singer really yeah get him to the Greek uh forgetting ceremonial look into it that's who Russell Brand is okay

1088
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:36.96
he's a man so it was an actor too yes super nice guy and he asked me to be on his podcast and it was

1089
01:53:36.96 --> 01:53:42.48
pretty it's pretty cool because he started off the podcast he was saying like he's been real

1090
01:53:42.48 --> 01:53:48.88
complimentary of me and like and and just being nice you know this guy you know he thanked me for my

1091
01:53:48.88 --> 01:53:54.88
service and and you know he he said I did great bunch of great stuff and and real complimentary

1092
01:53:54.88 --> 01:54:01.76
little nice and and I kind of said hey man I appreciate it I said bro I'm not like this I'm not a rare

1093
01:54:03.20 --> 01:54:09.84
hero from the military I said I had a kind of average career and then he goes well you know I just

1094
01:54:09.84 --> 01:54:15.60
wanted to say that because I want you to know that I respect the military but because I want to set

1095
01:54:15.60 --> 01:54:21.68
that up properly because I also have like some issues and I'm gonna probably go he didn't use the

1096
01:54:21.68 --> 01:54:26.24
term hard in the paint because he's from England but he basically meant I'm gonna go hard in the paint

1097
01:54:26.88 --> 01:54:33.52
on some topics and then I said well hey you should then know that even though I spent my

1098
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:39.20
don't life in the military I was also like a hardcore kid growing up listening to heavy metal

1099
01:54:39.20 --> 01:54:45.68
plane and bands I'm a rebellious kid I listened to punk rock and heavy metal and so you should just

1100
01:54:45.68 --> 01:54:49.84
know that too that even though I because he he also mentioned the music as I look like a hippie and

1101
01:54:49.84 --> 01:54:55.20
I was like because I know I look like a the most military human that you could imagine that's true

1102
01:54:55.20 --> 01:54:59.92
yeah that I also know that you know you should know that I'm kind of a rebel and that's well and so

1103
01:54:59.92 --> 01:55:06.48
then we had a little laugh and so so eventually you know we get to we start having the conversation and then

1104
01:55:07.36 --> 01:55:16.16
he posed this kind of two questions and they were somehow paired up or they were somehow there was

1105
01:55:16.16 --> 01:55:21.68
like a semi colon between them meaning they were attached they weren't quite separate but they were still

1106
01:55:21.68 --> 01:55:27.44
attached but they were they were a little bit separate so the one of them was like isn't war driven

1107
01:55:27.44 --> 01:55:31.44
by the profitability of the military industrial complex that was kind of question to one of them

1108
01:55:31.44 --> 01:55:39.44
one and then similar question isn't capitalism and and businesses and corporations aren't

1109
01:55:39.44 --> 01:55:46.40
they simply driven by the profitability for the rich owners and shareholders so that was kind

1110
01:55:46.40 --> 01:55:51.04
of the question aren't these two major forces in the world the military and the corporate world aren't

1111
01:55:51.04 --> 01:56:02.16
they just driven by greed essentially and then I answered him and you know my answer was well

1112
01:56:02.16 --> 01:56:12.32
Russell the answer is yes and I think I think he was a little bit taken aback by that

1113
01:56:13.04 --> 01:56:20.32
answer but the fact that matter is it's true that profits certainly drive corporations

1114
01:56:21.60 --> 01:56:30.32
to do things to to make products and defense companies certainly get rich during wars as we just

1115
01:56:30.32 --> 01:56:41.36
heard from smedly balder those totally true totally true and just like smedly balder like

1116
01:56:41.36 --> 01:56:46.000
you and I were saying that that's like one part of the argument that's not the only driver

1117
01:56:47.20 --> 01:56:55.44
that's not the only driver and I mean for the corporate example I work with hundreds of companies

1118
01:56:55.44 --> 01:57:03.28
and Dave you work with hundreds companies and the companies make money they make a lot of money

1119
01:57:06.88 --> 01:57:10.80
and they are certainly driven by profits in some way but they're also making products that people want

1120
01:57:10.80 --> 01:57:15.28
and they're making products that people need and they're employing people and they're making

1121
01:57:15.28 --> 01:57:22.40
products that make people's lives better that's what's happening in the vast majority of cases

1122
01:57:22.40 --> 01:57:29.60
no better example than medical device companies pharmaceutical companies and I've worked with

1123
01:57:29.60 --> 01:57:34.08
scores of medical device companies I've worked with scores of pharmaceutical companies over the last

1124
01:57:34.08 --> 01:57:39.84
decade and some of those companies that I've worked with that you've worked with Dave some of those

1125
01:57:39.84 --> 01:57:47.28
companies make hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars in profit billions of dollars in profit

1126
01:57:47.28 --> 01:57:53.60
and so you could say here's a well that's what's driving them just to want to make money but

1127
01:57:54.64 --> 01:57:59.52
I have also seen and met their patience along the way

1128
01:58:01.44 --> 01:58:08.40
you go to event and they got a man or a woman or a child a little boy or a little girl and the

1129
01:58:08.40 --> 01:58:16.48
only reason that that child is still alive is because of this device that that company makes

1130
01:58:16.48 --> 01:58:22.64
or this drug that this company makes that's why they are on stage they will present

1131
01:58:24.16 --> 01:58:28.64
and they'll get these people up there and say thank you and those patients who are only

1132
01:58:28.64 --> 01:58:35.92
alive because of these companies are grateful to be alive and they are overjoyed that those

1133
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:43.76
capitalist doctors were greedy enough to take the risk and invest money and push hard

1134
01:58:43.76 --> 01:58:48.32
and toil I do the work to create products that actually saved people's lives

1135
01:58:52.32 --> 01:59:00.40
and the same thing the same thing can be said for war the same thing can be said for war

1136
01:59:00.40 --> 01:59:07.44
and I have participated in wars that made some defense companies tons of money

1137
01:59:07.44 --> 01:59:15.28
you know I said I said this Russell brand something along the lines of like listen

1138
01:59:15.28 --> 01:59:18.96
I could be talking to my platoon and say all right guys here's what's going on tonight

1139
01:59:18.96 --> 01:59:22.32
we're going to go out we're going to risk our lives and I just wanted to let you know that every

1140
01:59:22.32 --> 01:59:27.76
round that you fire is going to put 12 cents into the pockets of the wartime profitiers

1141
01:59:28.48 --> 01:59:33.92
right and that would actually be true because that is true those those rounds cost money

1142
01:59:33.92 --> 01:59:41.44
and those defense companies make money from those things but I also know what happens on the ground

1143
01:59:41.44 --> 01:59:49.20
Dave you know what happens on the ground I know I know that we help people the people on the ground

1144
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:58.24
I know that we killed evil terrorists and insurgents that systematically tortured and raped

1145
01:59:58.24 --> 02:00:08.72
and murdered the innocent local populace I know that we did that I know that we were able to protect

1146
02:00:08.72 --> 02:00:13.84
children from these insurgents from these tears I know we were able to protect families I know

1147
02:00:13.84 --> 02:00:18.96
that those families wanted these insurgents out of their city and out of their country

1148
02:00:18.96 --> 02:00:27.28
and so while there were defense companies certainly making money there was a simultaneous

1149
02:00:30.72 --> 02:00:38.64
good that was taking place then we took lives but we also saved lives and that's the truth

1150
02:00:38.64 --> 02:00:49.28
enriching global corporations and enriching the military industrial complex that enrichment

1151
02:00:49.28 --> 02:00:55.44
certainly influences behaviors right it influences someone that's making a weapon system

1152
02:00:55.44 --> 02:01:01.20
to try and make their weapon system better to try and make better body armor there's a

1153
02:01:01.20 --> 02:01:06.48
there's someone right now as we speak that is trying to make better body armor and part of the

1154
02:01:06.48 --> 02:01:11.28
reason that trying to make it is to protect the American soldier but guess what they got a mortgage

1155
02:01:11.28 --> 02:01:15.52
to pay and they want to make better body armor because they want to make more money and if they

1156
02:01:15.52 --> 02:01:19.52
can make better body armor then the US government goes wow that's lighter it's stronger it

1157
02:01:20.32 --> 02:01:25.20
provides more protection we're going to buy it it's not that the person is just thinking about money

1158
02:01:26.48 --> 02:01:35.36
but the money that the the two goals are aligned there's a simultaneous drive that is that is moving

1159
02:01:35.36 --> 02:01:40.56
behavior in the right direction and oftentimes like I just use that example body armor they're aligned

1160
02:01:41.20 --> 02:01:42.72
with this company out there

1161
02:01:43.84 --> 02:01:47.20
acme body armor they want to make best body armor

1162
02:01:48.64 --> 02:01:53.12
and they want to make it do they want to protect Americans yes they do do they want to make money yes they do

1163
02:01:53.12 --> 02:01:59.92
so I have no problem with that if they're aligned it works out perfectly here's the problem

1164
02:01:59.92 --> 02:02:07.52
the problem is if they're out of alignment that's where it can become awful and that's what we

1165
02:02:07.52 --> 02:02:13.36
need to watch out for what is the driving force behind going to war are we going to work

1166
02:02:13.36 --> 02:02:19.20
is the right thing to do are we going to war for benevolent reasons are we positive that it will

1167
02:02:19.20 --> 02:02:25.60
have a positive impact that will offset the natural negative impacts of work because when you

1168
02:02:25.60 --> 02:02:28.64
go on a war there's going to be negative impacts people are going to die people are going to

1169
02:02:28.64 --> 02:02:33.68
get wounded and is the positive impact going to offset that negative impact is it going to help

1170
02:02:34.32 --> 02:02:41.28
stability in the world is there a strategic benefit for us as America

1171
02:02:45.52 --> 02:02:49.52
if we're going to war for those reasons because there's going to be a strategic advantage because

1172
02:02:49.52 --> 02:02:54.56
it protects our national security because it's going to be truly good for the people on the ground

1173
02:02:54.56 --> 02:03:02.40
that need protection that need help to get out from a tyrannical or evil regime and there are

1174
02:03:02.40 --> 02:03:12.56
evil regimes and if you don't think there's evil regimes you're wrong because there's people in the

1175
02:03:12.56 --> 02:03:23.68
world there's regimes in the world that will systematically rape little kids so if we're going to war

1176
02:03:23.68 --> 02:03:35.68
for those reasons okay we can consider it if the primary driver of going to war is to make money

1177
02:03:35.68 --> 02:03:42.08
if it's to profit if it's to sell more guns and bombs if it's not going to stabilize the

1178
02:03:42.08 --> 02:03:47.92
world if it doesn't help us protect our national security if it's going to be a strategic defeat

1179
02:03:47.92 --> 02:03:56.80
then we're wrong and can there be alignment by these two drivers yes there absolutely can

1180
02:03:57.36 --> 02:04:01.12
I don't mind I don't mind someone making great body armor making money off I don't

1181
02:04:01.12 --> 02:04:05.36
make I don't mind somebody making a great weapon system that makes a bunch of money and it

1182
02:04:05.36 --> 02:04:11.60
helps us win a war I have no problem with that at all but if these things aren't aligned and

1183
02:04:11.60 --> 02:04:14.96
we're fighting for money you're fighting for profit and we're not getting positive impact and

1184
02:04:14.96 --> 02:04:22.64
we're not getting strategic benefit well then we need to listen to major general smedly

1185
02:04:22.64 --> 02:04:33.76
butler and say to help with one that's what I'm thinking. Dave I'm with you I was thinking of a

1186
02:04:33.76 --> 02:04:38.80
story as you as you said that I I don't even remember why I was in the Pentagon but I was in the

1187
02:04:38.80 --> 02:04:46.80
Pentagon for something and it was maybe like I was just taking over this F-35 job and how

1188
02:04:46.80 --> 02:04:50.80
to go meet somebody in the Pentagon whatever Dave came up to the Pentagon I talked to some

1189
02:04:50.80 --> 02:04:55.12
general I'm literally walking the halls of the Pentagon and I run into who is an old

1190
02:04:55.12 --> 02:04:59.20
battalion commander that I work with who is now I happen to be a one star just literally walked

1191
02:04:59.20 --> 02:05:04.16
into him in a you know waiting room of some office somewhere waiting for some meeting and we

1192
02:05:04.16 --> 02:05:08.72
bumped into each other and he was there with a couple people from a company in industry so

1193
02:05:08.72 --> 02:05:16.64
civilians in the industry and he was there to show the technology of a helmet that they designed

1194
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:22.56
to stop a 762 caliber sniper rifle a helmet light enough what's strong enough to stop a sniper

1195
02:05:22.56 --> 02:05:28.96
rifle and for those of you who are listening to don't know the story of and I've talked in general

1196
02:05:28.96 --> 02:05:34.16
terms about my radio operator Chris Leon who was on my team the first Anglico Marine killed my

1197
02:05:34.16 --> 02:05:38.48
radio operator was killed in the money the first Anglico Marine killed an Iraq was my radio operator

1198
02:05:38.48 --> 02:05:42.08
was shot and killed by a sniper that pierced his helmet went right through the temple of his helmet

1199
02:05:42.08 --> 02:05:51.52
and killed him was I onboard with this company making profit making money off the American

1200
02:05:51.52 --> 02:05:58.32
taxpayer to design a helmet that would somehow have prevented what happened or at least can prevent

1201
02:05:58.32 --> 02:06:02.64
what might happen in the future yes I'm on board of that plan I'm onboard with that plan and I

1202
02:06:02.64 --> 02:06:08.24
support that plan and I want that plan to not only make them money but make enough money to

1203
02:06:08.24 --> 02:06:12.64
continue to build even better technology grow their company and be a positive force for whatever

1204
02:06:12.64 --> 02:06:17.92
may happen so I am I am totally on board with that idea and this idea of alignment

1205
02:06:19.60 --> 02:06:25.68
and while where I struggled especially towards the end listening to him talk you reading

1206
02:06:25.68 --> 02:06:32.80
his words was I think a trap that is so easy to fall into is that we describe it as the

1207
02:06:32.80 --> 02:06:40.88
government or industry or the military one of the things that I've learned in our current

1208
02:06:40.88 --> 02:06:46.56
jobs that these are actually people they're people the military is just people and generals

1209
02:06:46.56 --> 02:06:50.72
and animals are regular people and you know what there are some really good ones and there are

1210
02:06:50.72 --> 02:06:57.92
some not so good ones and people in the government I know classmates in mind that are that work

1211
02:06:57.92 --> 02:07:02.000
in the government and you know what they try to do most of the time every day the right thing

1212
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
they try to do the right thing do they always do the right thing no are their forces it

1213
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:12.000
play that make a difficult of course but when you fall into this trap of like oh it's the government

1214
02:07:12.72 --> 02:07:17.28
it's really is it created an error to buy which they're only goal is to somehow

1215
02:07:17.28 --> 02:07:24.24
whether it's lying there pockets or whatever that might be is we lose side of the fact that most

1216
02:07:24.24 --> 02:07:30.16
of the mechanics that are going on inside industry these companies we work with are regular people

1217
02:07:30.16 --> 02:07:35.36
trying to do the right thing even for the most part of my experience at the highest levels we work

1218
02:07:35.36 --> 02:07:42.56
with CEOs of multi billion dollar companies and what you get to know is that for the most part

1219
02:07:42.56 --> 02:07:48.000
for the most part they're people trying to do the right thing they try to make money yes

1220
02:07:48.72 --> 02:07:52.88
because for a whole host of good reasons they want to pay their bills they want to pay their

1221
02:07:52.88 --> 02:07:55.44
people they want to grow they want to expand they want to build bright products and they're

1222
02:07:55.44 --> 02:08:01.92
safe they can reach more but all these things and I'm not naive and I don't want people to think

1223
02:08:01.92 --> 02:08:06.48
the exact opposite of like everybody's just altruistic and for the for the big no that that's not the

1224
02:08:06.48 --> 02:08:15.36
case but there's a trap that we can fall into which was there's this this thing the industry

1225
02:08:15.36 --> 02:08:18.96
well if it's just the industry then yeah it's easy to paint them as this this this

1226
02:08:19.84 --> 02:08:23.44
thing that's not a real thing it's not a person it's not a human being and what this thing

1227
02:08:23.44 --> 02:08:31.52
wants is to just soak up dollar bills or waste human life to get to their end state

1228
02:08:31.52 --> 02:08:38.24
with no regard for that and and that is a that is a trap that I think it's easy to fall into

1229
02:08:38.24 --> 02:08:47.12
and you can hear his words like hey hang on a second just hang on who is this company who are

1230
02:08:47.12 --> 02:08:53.52
these industries or governments or whatever these things we're talking about most of the time

1231
02:08:53.52 --> 02:08:58.40
most of the time that are people trying to do the right thing that's what they are most of the time

1232
02:08:58.40 --> 02:09:07.20
yeah you know it's survivor biases yes yeah do you know what it is there things up it's like

1233
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.24
if you go out and you talk to 10 people that started companies and you say you know hey

1234
02:09:14.24 --> 02:09:18.24
how hard was it started company they're all like yeah it's pretty easy man you're not talking

1235
02:09:18.24 --> 02:09:22.80
to the 90 other people that failed so you get this survivor bias we get echelon from probably

1236
02:09:22.80 --> 02:09:28.48
have a little bit of echelon front bias which is we move the companies that we work with they

1237
02:09:28.48 --> 02:09:32.88
right extreme ownership they're in the game they listen to podcasts like these these are

1238
02:09:32.88 --> 02:09:41.68
companies that have a good sort of fundamental value system so we we kind of have a little bit of

1239
02:09:41.68 --> 02:09:46.72
that bias because you're right the amount of companies that we work with were I've said wow

1240
02:09:46.72 --> 02:09:53.12
this guy is gonna put this product out there that's harmful or this guy or this woman is

1241
02:09:53.12 --> 02:09:59.12
making a decision that's gonna cause their employees to suffer it doesn't happen it does now

1242
02:09:59.12 --> 02:10:05.28
other companies like that yes there are and and but I would tell you same thing even though even

1243
02:10:05.28 --> 02:10:10.08
with even if you take into account the EF bias the echelon front bias which is that most

1244
02:10:10.08 --> 02:10:15.76
people that we work with have a good value system even without accounted for most companies

1245
02:10:15.76 --> 02:10:20.56
these these days you have to have a good value system you have to be doing the right thing because

1246
02:10:20.56 --> 02:10:27.76
there's just too much information out there and a damn yelp review I mean on the like this

1247
02:10:27.76 --> 02:10:33.92
the base level hey if you run a restaurant and you treat your employees or your customers bad

1248
02:10:33.92 --> 02:10:39.20
a yelp review now you go big and you run into you know the Wall Street Journal is doing an

1249
02:10:39.20 --> 02:10:46.16
expose on what you did to maximize profits while you hurt your you know your your employees or

1250
02:10:46.16 --> 02:10:53.36
your clients or whatever so so the even in cases where you have people that might not be the most

1251
02:10:53.36 --> 02:11:00.48
altruistic people yeah the reality of modern technology keeps the vast majority of them in check

1252
02:11:00.48 --> 02:11:06.000
yes so that's true the other thing is look there's gonna be these two these two things they create a

1253
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.04
nice positive natural tension that's what we want we want to have someone saying like hey

1254
02:11:11.04 --> 02:11:15.44
yeah if you guys go to war we want you have the best gear that's good and the other the jett the

1255
02:11:15.44 --> 02:11:19.52
the business should be saying hey if we want you to go to war we want you have the best gear and

1256
02:11:19.52 --> 02:11:23.60
the general should be saying yeah we don't want to go to war but if we do we want the best gear

1257
02:11:23.60 --> 02:11:27.76
there's a little tension these guys might want to go to war more these guys might not but

1258
02:11:28.40 --> 02:11:32.56
there there should be a natural tension and I think what we have to watch out for is when there's no

1259
02:11:32.56 --> 02:11:38.08
when people lose that when there's no tension when there's no one saying hey you know you know

1260
02:11:38.08 --> 02:11:42.96
you know I just want you to think about something if we go to war it's Johnny over here that's

1261
02:11:42.96 --> 02:11:48.24
gonna get killed that's gonna lose his legs whatever the case may be that's what we never that's what

1262
02:11:48.24 --> 02:11:52.32
we need to make sure people think about and you know this goes back to one of the actually I

1263
02:11:52.32 --> 02:12:00.40
think it might have been the first like everything that I got recorded saying was when we did the

1264
02:12:00.40 --> 02:12:06.000
war fighters thing for the history channel about markedly and I've repeated this on a bunch of

1265
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.40
occasions well you know when it's time to go to war and it's time when you are willing you

1266
02:12:12.40 --> 02:12:17.52
you are willing you have the will and but it's the will to die and it's the will to kill and that's

1267
02:12:17.52 --> 02:12:21.92
what's gonna happen you're to war so you need to put that overlay on this yeah and if you ever

1268
02:12:21.92 --> 02:12:26.48
forget about that overlay that you think well you know this is worth it because it's gonna be beneficial

1269
02:12:26.48 --> 02:12:29.44
okay cool it's gonna be beneficial to the people there you know that we're gonna kill some of the

1270
02:12:29.44 --> 02:12:33.60
people there not just the enemy but some of the people that are there are going to die because of us

1271
02:12:33.60 --> 02:12:39.44
and we're going to have our own people killed that's what we need to think about we can never lose

1272
02:12:39.44 --> 02:12:45.44
that tension and and I think that that tension does get lost I think that the people that that

1273
02:12:45.44 --> 02:12:50.08
hold their hands they have a long way to second but what are we doing here and and part of the

1274
02:12:50.08 --> 02:12:58.72
reason is because when is it there's a saying old men want to go to war and young men do too I mean

1275
02:12:58.72 --> 02:13:03.92
you know it's that's a thing you survey freaking 19 year old kids that are in the Marine Corps

1276
02:13:03.92 --> 02:13:07.36
and you ask them how many people how many you want to go to war and there's a big

1277
02:13:07.36 --> 02:13:12.16
percentage that's coming through in the affirmative and that's the coolest part about the common

1278
02:13:12.16 --> 02:13:18.16
about that tension which is I mean that's actually the tension that you want is I want I actually

1279
02:13:18.16 --> 02:13:23.92
want Marines that want to go to war so I want them reason want to go to war and do I love the idea

1280
02:13:23.92 --> 02:13:33.76
of rolepiece yes I love that idea I love that idea that idea is not going to happen today or tomorrow

1281
02:13:33.76 --> 02:13:41.76
it's not going to happen and is as much as I love the fantasy of this the the simple things

1282
02:13:41.76 --> 02:13:48.16
we need to do to to achieve that the the tension is you know with that reality too is that hey

1283
02:13:48.16 --> 02:13:53.60
not only is that not likely there are people that actively do not want that actively do not

1284
02:13:53.60 --> 02:13:59.28
want that and you know he I was he was talking about you know the next step is we're going to

1285
02:13:59.28 --> 02:14:04.40
see war with chemicals and and he was sort of foreshadowing what then and he was correct obviously

1286
02:14:04.40 --> 02:14:08.40
you know we we know that there is you know some of those things he saw that it won't work to the chemical

1287
02:14:08.40 --> 02:14:13.04
warfare and he was foreshadowing this ever growing capacity for people to wage war against each other

1288
02:14:13.04 --> 02:14:17.36
and these awful awful ways well you know you could get rid of all the weapons in the world and

1289
02:14:17.36 --> 02:14:23.60
there's people waging wars computers now so this this this persistence of the reality

1290
02:14:25.84 --> 02:14:29.84
even with some of the nefarious things and the profit here's the my path there there's a reality

1291
02:14:29.84 --> 02:14:34.56
out there that we also need to accept and face and I want to be around people that want to do that

1292
02:14:35.20 --> 02:14:42.24
I want to be around those people and I want Marines I want Marines that have that exact same feeling

1293
02:14:42.24 --> 02:14:46.56
and yes you want to manage that and temper that and guide that and shape it yes all those things

1294
02:14:46.56 --> 02:14:51.92
but I want to be around those people and I think that that tension that you talked about that

1295
02:14:51.92 --> 02:14:57.44
natural tension because those two things exist in the world and to pretend like they don't is

1296
02:14:58.08 --> 02:15:03.44
is not a good plan yeah I don't know what the percentage of people let's say you let's say you

1297
02:15:03.44 --> 02:15:08.000
do what they said if you take the young man that are going to have to go to war and they get to vote

1298
02:15:09.04 --> 02:15:13.52
I almost feel I almost don't feel super comfortable with that because I think a lot of them will be like oh yeah

1299
02:15:13.52 --> 02:15:18.48
it's on here's my chance yeah it's on but I'm not sure that's also my own warped

1300
02:15:18.48 --> 02:15:22.48
that's sort of the jockel bias which is I think everyone's kind of thinks like me which I know

1301
02:15:22.48 --> 02:15:26.96
is not true there's also a chance that I'm wrong and a bunch of people would say no matter what

1302
02:15:26.96 --> 02:15:30.24
was happening in the world maybe like no we're not going to war you know what I mean so you

1303
02:15:30.24 --> 02:15:35.12
got to have somebody with a detached perspective yeah that's actually saying you know what now

1304
02:15:35.12 --> 02:15:40.000
is not the time to go to war or a detached perspective and say hey we're looking at this whole thing

1305
02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:45.28
we see Nazis we see them running rough shot all over we need to do something about this

1306
02:15:46.08 --> 02:15:52.80
and you described it again I I you know when you call it the tensioner or this idea hey when

1307
02:15:52.80 --> 02:15:57.44
you've got some skin in the game when it's not Johnny it's your Johnny when you're talking about

1308
02:15:57.44 --> 02:16:05.20
who's going to war yeah I love that idea of oh you're talking about me now okay hang on let me

1309
02:16:05.20 --> 02:16:08.96
let me put some thought into it because in the end the answer actually might still be yeah I'm

1310
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:14.40
gonna send my son off to war but I'm certainly gonna think about it a lot harder the closer it is

1311
02:16:14.40 --> 02:16:19.04
to me and I mean that's been the challenge in society forever which was do we want to

1312
02:16:19.04 --> 02:16:23.28
insulate our people for more yeah we do I want I want to insulate America for more and you could look

1313
02:16:23.28 --> 02:16:28.88
it we talked about Afghanistan are there some good things that come out of that yeah absolutely

1314
02:16:28.88 --> 02:16:33.84
and if you insulate them so much if you if you remove them so much that they don't even

1315
02:16:33.84 --> 02:16:38.72
understand what really is happening those decisions actually aren't the best decisions because

1316
02:16:39.44 --> 02:16:42.88
what are they care right yeah yeah it's a great idea go go go go to war

1317
02:16:44.24 --> 02:16:48.16
doesn't affect me at all I don't want a society that has no impact on that either and even

1318
02:16:48.16 --> 02:16:54.64
inside that you talk about the tension of I want to keep I want to separate us from that as much

1319
02:16:54.64 --> 02:16:58.80
as possible but it's not but not so much that don't understand what it actually what what that

1320
02:16:58.80 --> 02:17:02.24
really means is send somebody off to war we were just talking an hour ago when these people

1321
02:17:02.24 --> 02:17:05.68
went to war war one to even know what they were doing they even know what it meant to send someone

1322
02:17:05.68 --> 02:17:11.36
to war and there's just no way yeah there's some some great things with technology and and

1323
02:17:12.24 --> 02:17:16.40
if you're doing something for the wrong reason it's pretty it's it's much harder to hide that now

1324
02:17:16.40 --> 02:17:21.20
than it ever used to be if you're industrial plan or your company plan is really in affairs

1325
02:17:22.40 --> 02:17:25.20
you're running the risk of getting found out there's just too much information that's free

1326
02:17:25.20 --> 02:17:29.44
out there it's really hard to keep those secrets anymore but send somebody off to a war war

1327
02:17:29.44 --> 02:17:34.48
one you think anybody really knew what that meant no and do I do think they should know a little bit

1328
02:17:34.48 --> 02:17:40.32
yeah I see his point it's your kid going you might think twice before you send him put to

1329
02:17:40.32 --> 02:17:44.80
like you said too they're actually times so you know say yeah because the alternative they're

1330
02:17:46.08 --> 02:17:54.96
that's not acceptable well definitely I think the lesson here is keep your minds open

1331
02:17:54.96 --> 02:18:02.88
and listen and try and understand these various perspectives that are out there because I bet

1332
02:18:02.88 --> 02:18:07.36
there's a bunch of people that hear this nigga what that guy was a traitor or whatever they're

1333
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:12.48
going to say yeah or say yeah yeah and it's just that's just makes it so interesting because

1334
02:18:12.48 --> 02:18:17.44
it can't call a guy that did what he did in his life a traitor and what we should actually do

1335
02:18:17.44 --> 02:18:24.24
is listen that's what we should do with an open mind when an open mind goes a long way yeah

1336
02:18:24.96 --> 02:18:30.64
with that echo Charles yes sir so we're trying to keep our minds open but we're also trying to

1337
02:18:30.64 --> 02:18:38.16
keep our minds sharp yes sir keep sharp minds got to keep the vessel that the mind is contained

1338
02:18:38.16 --> 02:18:45.60
and got to keep that kind of up and running sure concur the brain well yeah no we're the brain

1339
02:18:45.60 --> 02:18:52.08
the brain is in the body sure let's call more specifically more specifically yep so you look at you

1340
02:18:52.08 --> 02:18:58.80
yeah I'm trying yeah creative to my comments there was there was a there was a part in there where he was

1341
02:18:58.80 --> 02:19:03.12
he was kind of going hard you know exposing all these profits and all this stuff and it makes sense man

1342
02:19:03.12 --> 02:19:08.64
so and you can kind of get a taste of his emotional state right it makes sense but also you

1343
02:19:08.64 --> 02:19:14.40
got to say hey man if I was having to fight the freaking Nazis how happy am I that I have some

1344
02:19:14.40 --> 02:19:18.80
Americans steel manufacturer that is stay in awake 24 hours every scene that that when they used to

1345
02:19:18.80 --> 02:19:23.04
build those liberty ships you know what I'm talking about Dave there's these big liberty ships

1346
02:19:23.04 --> 02:19:27.04
that were used to transport stuff back and cross back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean

1347
02:19:27.04 --> 02:19:33.92
yeah they were making them in a day a freaking whole ship bro this is impossible and America was

1348
02:19:33.92 --> 02:19:38.56
doing it in a day now if I was over there on the front lines and I needed some more ammunition I would

1349
02:19:38.56 --> 02:19:43.44
be so damn happy and I would be more than happy that people are making a bunch of money now the

1350
02:19:43.44 --> 02:19:49.28
profits get a little bit extreme maybe they got a little extreme yeah so in that that's kind of

1351
02:19:49.28 --> 02:19:54.80
the point there where you can kind of he goes hard in like both directions and you're like oh man

1352
02:19:54.80 --> 02:19:58.56
I see I especially when he's talking about the waste you know like the ships that don't even run

1353
02:19:58.56 --> 02:20:01.84
and it's like no we're still paying the bill and it's like and then meanwhile you know from his

1354
02:20:01.84 --> 02:20:06.80
perspective he sees all the all the downside of war right hardcore and then he kind of see

1355
02:20:06.80 --> 02:20:10.000
and he looks and he sees all these numbers all these dollar signs that go to other people

1356
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.68
whatever who are making shady ships and all this stuff oh man I get it but he went a little bit too

1357
02:20:15.68 --> 02:20:20.16
hard and a button and even the in these little subtle way extreme extreme so he can make you

1358
02:20:20.16 --> 02:20:25.28
shut it up about that little bit yes and and I was trying to stay like with you guys were like okay

1359
02:20:25.28 --> 02:20:29.44
get it no no maybe not but there was a part he was talking about the boots right he was like

1360
02:20:29.44 --> 02:20:34.08
all they made all these boots and like all this stuff whatever and I'm so thinking wait that's the

1361
02:20:34.08 --> 02:20:39.52
we kind of need those boots but we only had 4 million soldiers and we bought 25 million boots

1362
02:20:39.52 --> 02:20:43.52
yes okay and then that part it's like okay yes as far as the waste goes 100% that's going to

1363
02:20:43.52 --> 02:20:49.52
apply across the board um and then he he went on to even add like oh those were good boots

1364
02:20:49.52 --> 02:20:54.08
yeah yeah I was like yeah we need those boots yeah but we need the way of course we need the

1365
02:20:54.08 --> 02:20:59.12
waste that's the same thing with the ships and all that stuff but so you could tell like all you

1366
02:20:59.12 --> 02:21:03.28
get it is kind of detached from like that very specific perspective just a little bit in your

1367
02:21:03.28 --> 02:21:08.80
like okay this kind of might not be getting it you know in certain ways well I don't think that's

1368
02:21:08.80 --> 02:21:13.44
a great example because you can also say hey he gets it these are boots we need boots they're

1369
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:17.44
good boots they're probably lasting for a long time we didn't need 25 million pairs you know

1370
02:21:17.44 --> 02:21:23.52
bro yeah it's true yeah so he he's getting it where he loses it is just saying that that's the

1371
02:21:23.52 --> 02:21:27.36
only reason that they're doing it right and that's what I mean where and because that's it's

1372
02:21:27.36 --> 02:21:31.60
seem like it put it this way it seemed like he was going hard in that direction it's like that's

1373
02:21:31.60 --> 02:21:37.84
what he kind of wanted you to think yeah it's it also shows you that the you know you have a

1374
02:21:37.84 --> 02:21:43.76
government organization that's running things and it's not your money yeah you're gonna get

1375
02:21:43.76 --> 02:21:51.92
fraudwaste in abuse yeah that's why that's why it's usually better to have a little bit less

1376
02:21:51.92 --> 02:21:57.92
government control over things yeah that's a cheap thing is decentralized is possible and I know

1377
02:21:57.92 --> 02:22:06.16
I covered a little bit of of Thomas Sol's book I think I don't know if I even got to it it was I don't

1378
02:22:06.16 --> 02:22:10.24
think you were on the podcast was with Jordan Peterson but he got this little section where he

1379
02:22:10.24 --> 02:22:15.92
just talks about how freaking hard it is to like control price you just you can't you can't do it

1380
02:22:15.92 --> 02:22:20.64
you can't control price has to do with the pelts of some animal and there's a worth a certain amount

1381
02:22:22.56 --> 02:22:27.04
and then he goes through how hard it is to control the price and then he says in by the way there's

1382
02:22:27.84 --> 02:22:33.92
whatever 1.2 billion products or line items that you need to control the price of it's impossible

1383
02:22:33.92 --> 02:22:39.12
you gotta let the free market work a little bit and that's where you run into problems where you

1384
02:22:39.12 --> 02:22:46.16
have the free market brush up against the government the government checkbook and they're like

1385
02:22:46.16 --> 02:22:52.16
yeah we can make a you probably need 25 million boots how many soldiers you got 4 million

1386
02:22:53.36 --> 02:23:00.08
sign here yeah it's true because you know like you would you get what the old thing the irresponsible

1387
02:23:00.08 --> 02:23:04.40
person with a crew when they first get a credit card kind of feels like oh so my money right

1388
02:23:04.40 --> 02:23:08.72
so then they overspend they can't pay that can stuff so it's like and like it makes sense that

1389
02:23:08.72 --> 02:23:14.80
phenomenon does make sense people will spend their other people's money like crazy they do it all

1390
02:23:14.80 --> 02:23:18.40
time that's where the government does the government spends other people's money all the time

1391
02:23:19.76 --> 02:23:25.84
you know do we need to spend some money yeah yeah but if you looked at it from like a household

1392
02:23:25.84 --> 02:23:32.24
perspective if this if this either this state wearing California or this country if you look

1393
02:23:32.24 --> 02:23:39.20
at it from that standpoint of hey our budget you know we make you hey look here's hey you know

1394
02:23:39.20 --> 02:23:47.76
hey darling life we make $5,000 a month that's how much income we bring in we're gonna buy a car

1395
02:23:47.76 --> 02:23:55.04
that's gonna cost us $2,000 a month that we're gonna rent an apartment that's gonna cost us $4,000 a month

1396
02:23:55.04 --> 02:24:00.88
and they're gonna go out to eat every night that total is gonna be $7,000 a month you can

1397
02:24:00.88 --> 02:24:05.60
figure out real quick like oh I'm in the hole this is the credit card problem yeah so but if it's not

1398
02:24:05.60 --> 02:24:10.16
our money yeah we're kind of like hey we're gonna do that a little bit so good yeah yeah well

1399
02:24:10.16 --> 02:24:16.40
I don't think it's got to careful with this stuff yeah all right what do we got so speaking of being

1400
02:24:16.40 --> 02:24:22.80
careful I like it we got to be careful with what we put in our bodies especially on this path the

1401
02:24:22.80 --> 02:24:29.28
path is hard they broke I'm saying it's hard it's not always easy it's fun can be fun from time to

1402
02:24:29.28 --> 02:24:36.56
time let's you when you're collecting those long-term gains seems to be capability cognitive enhancement

1403
02:24:36.56 --> 02:24:41.44
smart all that stuff better decision making too either way we're on this path we want to stay

1404
02:24:41.44 --> 02:24:46.64
healthy stay ahead of the game health wise day by notice you drinking the mango discipline good

1405
02:24:46.64 --> 02:24:51.28
choice you could drink the orange could have but have a little bit of love hate relationship

1406
02:24:51.28 --> 02:24:56.96
with the mango stand fully so discipline go that's what this is that's what we're talking about here

1407
02:24:56.96 --> 02:25:04.48
it's a healthy energy drink yep it's a big deal most times energy drink as we know or as we

1408
02:25:04.48 --> 02:25:08.96
knew oh I know where I'm gonna go with this right now where are you going well we were talking

1409
02:25:08.96 --> 02:25:14.000
earlier about the fact that hey most companies are out there trying to do the right thing you

1410
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.56
know and guess what we have we have some companies that are out there saying oh you know what

1411
02:25:18.56 --> 02:25:24.40
if I can cut the cost my product by a little bit add some chemicals to it that are a little bit cheaper

1412
02:25:25.44 --> 02:25:32.000
give people an addictive thing called sugar and they'll just buy more of it cool so we got our

1413
02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.96
example now we got some nefarious companies out there making poison and feeding it to people it's

1414
02:25:36.96 --> 02:25:41.60
it's kind of a spectrum to and consider I'm not just saying necessarily energy drinks or whatever but

1415
02:25:41.60 --> 02:25:46.000
like in general especially when it comes to stuff that you eat or bleeding about whatever because

1416
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.60
you're dealing with two different forces there yeah you don't know if you're talking about that though

1417
02:25:49.60 --> 02:25:54.40
is this like is the attitude like yeah but that's what people want right that's what I'm saying

1418
02:25:54.40 --> 02:25:59.36
there's two different forces and that's not a good that that's that's what people want that doesn't

1419
02:25:59.36 --> 02:26:04.96
mean you can't just make adjustments to give them what they want and not give them poison

1420
02:26:04.96 --> 02:26:10.32
hey some people want crack some people want some people want vodka straight up mainstream some

1421
02:26:10.32 --> 02:26:17.04
people want vodka is vodka good is vodka good no kind of hard to make the argument on you know

1422
02:26:17.04 --> 02:26:20.80
many many levels either way I dig where you're saying but guess what we don't have to worry

1423
02:26:20.80 --> 02:26:25.60
about that can't stop anymore we are not in a various company we are making the clean the clean

1424
02:26:25.60 --> 02:26:31.84
energy drink both uh win win upside short term upside long term in many ways too by the way

1425
02:26:31.84 --> 02:26:36.88
this electrolytes in this one yeah imagine just being saying oh yeah you want to try something

1426
02:26:36.88 --> 02:26:43.52
all upside all how often you get that in life you know here's something all upside yeah and

1427
02:26:43.52 --> 02:26:48.72
as far as like the mango flavor is like really upside yeah that's what's interesting it's like

1428
02:26:48.72 --> 02:26:53.12
it's compared to other flavors which is just normal upside which I understand of course

1429
02:26:53.12 --> 02:26:57.84
either way if you want if you want to take part in this energy drink rather than the poison

1430
02:26:57.84 --> 02:27:00.96
is starting to go down the path now we're now we're starting to talk about nefarious

1431
02:27:00.96 --> 02:27:05.68
companies I'm going straight to the clothing manufacturers next that are out there cut in the

1432
02:27:05.68 --> 02:27:11.60
corners and saying oh we'll just get this made in China we got slave labor over there we got the

1433
02:27:11.60 --> 02:27:17.04
weegers over there in actual slave labor camps making your making your shorts how's that feel

1434
02:27:17.76 --> 02:27:23.92
don't feel good no I don't feel good about it that's why you know what I don't get I don't get

1435
02:27:23.92 --> 02:27:31.04
shorts that are made in China yeah I dig it but back to the energy drink okay you want to stick

1436
02:27:31.04 --> 02:27:41.20
with those fermento and physical enhancements chance your capability also you can get stuff to

1437
02:27:41.20 --> 02:27:50.40
to take you out of any kind of roadblocks or speed bumps in recovery we got protein we got stuff for

1438
02:27:50.40 --> 02:27:57.84
your joints we got stuff for immunity we also got protein but you could actually just call it

1439
02:27:57.84 --> 02:28:02.96
dessert yes another one of those if you don't have any emergency you have a day I thought I ran

1440
02:28:02.96 --> 02:28:08.72
on a peanut butter wait peanut butter flavor milk peanut butter flavor milk yeah but then it

1441
02:28:08.72 --> 02:28:14.64
was in the back of the Japanese but I was like speaking a crack yeah I look like a crack

1442

02:29:29.60 --> 02:29:38.16
large corporations that may not be as benevolent the jockel fuel yeah it's a good move right there

1457

subscribe to percent also origin USA this is where you can get American made stuff you said it you mentioned

1458
02:29:43.76 --> 02:29:50.08
it like some time a some places some some some of those that that some of the people where

1459
02:29:51.12 --> 02:29:55.84
it's made with slave labor straight up and varying levels of slave slave labor to you can go

1460
02:29:55.84 --> 02:29:59.04
deep in that rabbit hole find out some stuff they brought you know yeah you can go on

1461
02:29:59.04 --> 02:30:02.32
not whatever those other youtube channels are that you were talking about you can watch

1462
02:30:02.32 --> 02:30:06.56
you know little kids get beaten because they didn't produce enough freaking pairs of

1463
02:30:07.44 --> 02:30:12.80
shorts yeah you can go deep for sure but without depressing anything but the

1464
02:30:12.80 --> 02:30:16.08
factories where they got nets around them for some of the people trying to kill themselves

1465
02:30:16.08 --> 02:30:20.08
they they hit the net and then they drag them back in and put them back in from the sewing machine

1466
02:30:22.08 --> 02:30:27.76
yeah that was really scare I didn't know that that was real that's real yeah but that's a scary

1467
02:30:27.76 --> 02:30:33.04
thing to consider like that's how common it is that they have a straight up SOP like a little

1468
02:30:33.04 --> 02:30:38.88
protocol in the place oh yeah this is just to prevent the people from from actually dying one they

1469
02:30:38.88 --> 02:30:42.72
try to commit suicide that's what we want another day and a half a little bit we need that

1470
02:30:42.72 --> 02:30:48.40
labor seems same for this for clothes so we're not not down with that we're not that down with

1471
02:30:48.40 --> 02:30:53.76
that so all this stuff is a made in America b made in America by people who want to make this

1472
02:30:53.76 --> 02:30:59.20
this stuff they're so fired up like Brad just grab one person from there okay so you can and you can

1473
02:30:59.20 --> 02:31:03.12
see this on their youtube channel by the way but you see the people making it they're probably

1474
02:31:03.12 --> 02:31:06.32
like explained the whole thing yeah no but like oh yeah this one is this and this is the

1475
02:31:06.32 --> 02:31:10.08
fact I saw one where they were saying hey I'm making this for this very specific person I was like

1476
02:31:10.08 --> 02:31:16.32
dang help that's where I want to get my stuff from for sure or genus a dot com it's true

1477
02:31:16.32 --> 02:31:22.40
lady America yeah jetz is still home in America yeah seeds jetzu stuff it boots by the way

1478
02:31:22.40 --> 02:31:28.16
we have we made we sold the government 24 million pairs boots we haven't yet but even if we did

1479
02:31:28.16 --> 02:31:32.96
we wouldn't sell them 24 million not necessarily out of they don't need to know especially because

1480
02:31:32.96 --> 02:31:40.80
these boots are gonna last yeah so and you're gonna look good too let's face it yeah echo if

1481
02:31:40.80 --> 02:31:45.20
yeah if echo ever goes into combat he's gonna be like he's gonna keep the point of

1482
02:31:45.20 --> 02:31:52.24
the earth well that that's something that does have some value same same because I think

1483
02:31:52.24 --> 02:31:56.48
a lot of people we care about like at the very least a little bit about what it looks like

1484
02:31:56.48 --> 02:32:01.76
same same put on the Delta 68 it's not like I didn't look in the mirror I was like it's not

1485
02:32:01.76 --> 02:32:05.76
like I was like you sure they fit and then just kind of walked out and just I looked in the mirror

1486
02:32:05.76 --> 02:32:11.92
a little bit and in fact I remember what I read shirted and football and we're warming up for the

1487
02:32:11.92 --> 02:32:17.36
game you know you can you can suit up for the game when you read shirt for football and the coach said

1488
02:32:18.08 --> 02:32:23.92
he was like dang echo looks good and is uniform he's not ready to play but he looks good and is uniform

1489
02:32:23.92 --> 02:32:29.44

02:32:29.44 --> 02:32:34.48
be ready to operate you are a love good yeah that's what I felt when I put him in Delta 68

02:32:34.48 --> 02:32:39.68
yeah I'm not ready for you know the the mecon Delta but I'm ready to wear this stuff for

1510
02:34:17.84 --> 02:34:22.96
oh my gosh to the sea wolves on there we've got an homage to another group that we have

1511
02:34:22.96 --> 02:34:27.12
grown very fond of that's all I'm gonna say that means back that thing that's all it out

1512
02:34:27.12 --> 02:34:30.24
that's all that's all that means back that thing before you're rolling out yeah why

1513
02:34:30.24 --> 02:34:35.12
is because I got to oh you got to be a ominous don't want to okay just a confirmed right

1514
02:34:35.12 --> 02:34:38.40
there have been errors made in the past I think we don't need to bring them up right now but

1515
02:34:38.40 --> 02:34:43.28
there have been things that have been created without approval and they were not correct

1516
02:34:43.28 --> 02:34:48.32
all right well you know it's a risk we all run but yes that's correct and occasionally occasionally

1517
02:34:48.32 --> 02:34:52.24
you know look I'm I'm prone to run the things a little bit too decentralized that's kind of what

1518
02:34:52.24 --> 02:34:57.12
I do yes but occasionally let's do a little inspection to make sure we aren't

1519
02:34:57.84 --> 02:35:02.80
making mistakes that we don't want to make what we call a QA quality of course sure it's on

1520
02:35:02.80 --> 02:35:06.96
this before you print the shirt and send it to people you should do that yeah I think you might be

1521
02:35:06.96 --> 02:35:10.80
right about that actually okay I understand what you're saying now yes I remember I remember

1522
02:35:10.80 --> 02:35:16.08
Dave Birkin now actually Dave Birkin was a big part of that rectification okay yeah yeah

1523
02:35:16.08 --> 02:35:21.12
when I say a big part I mean the part so let's let's just do a review this is what we'll call it

1524
02:35:21.12 --> 02:35:26.40
a review hey subscribe to this podcast whatever you subscribe to podcast we also have

1529
02:35:54.40 --> 02:36:03.52
you always like gloss over the oh just do Q&A or whatever and a lot of those questions are like

1530
02:36:04.16 --> 02:36:09.52
that's like advice like if you want life advice from jockel it's sort of the essentially it's calling

1531
02:36:09.52 --> 02:36:15.60
my guess it is bro it is and jockel will like life coach you jockel underground dot com hell yeah

1532
02:36:15.60 --> 02:36:20.24
it sounds funny when you say like that but conceptually you know it's because I said that for the first time

1533
02:36:20.24 --> 02:36:25.12
along like before I even got out of the navy because guys are coming to me and be like it is going

1534
02:36:25.12 --> 02:36:29.92
on a bad jockel like life coach you know and I'd say there's what you need to do bro

1535
02:36:29.92 --> 02:36:34.24
and it's effective I'm telling you sometimes like they'll ask these questions and I'll be like

1536
02:36:34.24 --> 02:36:38.96
oh y'all read the question or whatever and you think you know you think you know what I'm going to say

1537
02:36:38.96 --> 02:36:44.24
well I had a lot of times I do know what you're going to say in general but here's the thing

1538
02:36:44.24 --> 02:36:48.96
here's what happens sometimes where someone I'll read the question and I'll be like oh yeah

1539
02:36:48.96 --> 02:36:53.04
that's a unique question for that person you know it doesn't really apply to me so it'll be

1540
02:36:53.04 --> 02:36:56.64
interesting to hear jockel's answer which I may or may not know the answer you know for us the

1541
02:36:56.64 --> 02:37:01.44
one he's going to give but then you expand on this answer it's like wait a second I think I didn't use that

1542
02:37:01.44 --> 02:37:05.60
right there it's just insane so it kind of like it kind of affects your life even even though

1543
02:37:05.60 --> 02:37:10.64
the questions not like necessarily just yours if you got questions you want to answer do you want to hear
